00:04 - all right
00:05 - and we are back
00:08 - in my comments uh
00:12 - we need meme review
00:16 - i agree
00:20 - [Music]
00:22 - okay let's check it out check it out
00:24 - check it out
00:29 - all right so i don't know if you guys
00:31 - notice but i
00:32 - now have some awesome decorations back
00:34 - there i got an elephant
00:37 - two little plants literally the only
00:39 - decorations in my
00:40 - entire apartment all right and we got a
00:43 - logo
00:44 - no more uh streaming hard duck
00:49 - what is this testing this is just
00:52 - testing the uh stream
00:53 - i just signed up for a stream yard it's
00:56 - called
00:57 - and just streaming on youtube making
01:00 - sure my audio is good
01:01 - video is good and pretty much it
01:07 - yeah i move my jacket so you know you
01:09 - can see my awesome decorations a little
01:11 - bit better
01:12 - it's two decorations i do have a cool
01:15 - steve jobs poster
01:17 - but i don't want to like tape it to my
01:20 - wall
01:20 - i'm too lazy to frame it i don't have
01:23 - any thumbtacks so
01:24 - it's kind of just like a laying on the
01:26 - ground now should probably just tape it
01:28 - up there
01:30 - all right and look at this
01:35 - actually you guys dig in the red the
01:38 - minimal
01:39 - or no display name i kind of like the
01:42 - minimum myself
01:46 - stream yard cost uh i think this was
01:48 - actually let me see
01:51 - i just purchased it like 30 seconds ago
01:54 - [Music]
01:57 - 39 a month
02:01 - yeah this was uh actually they got a
02:04 - 20 a month plan but it had something
02:07 - up it didn't have full hd and i know you
02:10 - guys want to see my beautiful face in
02:12 - full hd of course so
02:14 - i had a splooge on that for you
02:16 - [Music]
02:18 - not using obs um so
02:21 - i used to use obs to stream on twitch
02:23 - but they like fried my mac every time i
02:25 - turn it on it was over in
02:27 - and also another fun fact for you guys
02:30 - is i had to uninstall
02:32 - adobe creative cloud because even though
02:35 - i like the software it was also
02:36 - frying my mac whenever i turn on
02:38 - camtasia to record anything
02:40 - it was just like uh heard my mac
02:42 - spinning fans overheating
02:44 - and i looked at the processes and there
02:46 - were like 500 processes running in the
02:48 - background
02:49 - so i close all my adobe apps and then i
02:51 - close the uh
02:53 - like that little uh tool menu in the top
02:55 - right the creative cloud one
02:57 - and still i looked at my processes and
02:59 - these things weren't shutting down
03:00 - so i'm like whatever just uninstall that
03:05 - okay yo bucky what up not much
03:10 - what's up bucky not much and let's see
03:16 - um these comments are moving a little
03:17 - too fast okay
03:23 - i use please help sir what are the most
03:25 - important subjects for cs student
03:27 - operating systems network c plus plus
03:29 - java other languages
03:30 - their computation architecture please
03:33 - answer
03:34 - so for that i would say
03:38 - there is no um there's no one right
03:41 - answer
03:42 - it really depends on where are you
03:43 - trying to go what do you want to achieve
03:45 - in the future
03:46 - and then once you decide upon that
03:49 - figuring out the best path to get there
03:51 - but for some of those you may need those
03:53 - skills for some of you may never need
03:55 - them so
04:02 - uh why does a variable appear
04:04 - uninitialized in main c
04:05 - plus which was declared and taken as
04:08 - input
04:09 - from class dot cpp i do not
04:13 - remember that tutorial that specifically
04:15 - so i would have to
04:17 - look
04:21 - how to get freelancing projects and make
04:23 - a career
04:24 - in freelancing so i never did
04:27 - freelancing but i know upwork
04:28 - is the site that i use whenever i need
04:31 - freelancers
04:32 - so possibly that route
04:35 - can you make a tutorial about good
04:37 - practice in convention
04:39 - uh programming i
04:42 - like that idea actually i am uh obsessed
04:45 - with clean code
04:47 - to a point where it's not even like
04:50 - clean clothes
04:51 - it's more like ocd really um
04:55 - just making sure like properties are in
04:58 - alphabetical order
04:59 - and uh imports are optimized
05:03 - everything is nice and standard and you
05:05 - know what on the topic of clean code
05:08 - so i actually uh had a debate with a few
05:12 - people about this
05:13 - and whenever you're working on a
05:16 - software project as a team
05:18 - clean code seems like kind of um
05:20 - strictly an ocd thing
05:22 - but the reason that i like it is because
05:25 - whenever you have standards and really
05:27 - clean code you can go to any part of the
05:29 - code base
05:30 - and it you can't tell who it was written
05:33 - by
05:34 - and that's kind of the goal in my mind
05:36 - where everything is standardized
05:37 - consistent
05:39 - so it doesn't look like each part is
05:41 - written by a different team or a
05:42 - different pod however your teams are
05:44 - structured
05:45 - and also these little things of
05:48 - okay where do i look for this property
05:50 - in the list of like
05:51 - 60 properties or was this imported and
05:54 - then you have to find it
05:55 - it's all those little things where you
05:57 - don't think about
05:58 - but these seconds they add up and kind
06:01 - of
06:04 - i always kind of equated it to this
06:06 - where uh
06:08 - it may not be that correct or the best
06:11 - analogy but
06:13 - programming is a lot like just reading
06:15 - any language
06:16 - where you start to read and
06:20 - you're focused on just the letters you
06:22 - learn b and t and
06:24 - bat okay on
06:27 - ba in you are you put so much time and
06:31 - energy onto each
06:33 - character and then later each word that
06:35 - by the time you get to the end of a
06:36 - sentence
06:37 - you don't you pretty much forgot what
06:39 - was at the beginning and your reading
06:41 - comprehension is
06:42 - really um low when you first started out
06:46 - but eventually after you get more
06:48 - familiar with it it's like
06:49 - the dog is on the uh house or whatever
06:52 - it is
06:53 - and then you can begin to understand the
06:56 - words and then the sentences and then
06:57 - things just flow
06:59 - and then after a while you aren't
07:01 - thinking about those specific words
07:03 - you're thinking more about the meaning
07:04 - and paragraph and the story so kind of
07:07 - like coding
07:08 - the more familiar you are with it in the
07:10 - more the easier it is to read
07:12 - uh these different patterns you can
07:14 - focus more on the
07:15 - problem that you're trying to solve
07:17 - rather than the syntax of what does this
07:19 - do
07:19 - or where is this thing all of those
07:22 - little question marks you can get out of
07:23 - the way
07:25 - can allow you to focus on the the
07:27 - problem itself
07:28 - wow that was a long answer i didn't even
07:30 - remember what the original question was
07:31 - but let's
07:32 - scroll back up here flutter you guys
07:34 - really love flutter flutter is coming
07:38 - this is uh kind of my game plan for
07:39 - youtube videos and
07:41 - before i get to that let me um
07:44 - actually how am i going to show you guys
07:47 - this
07:48 - if you go to my twitter uh
07:51 - my name is bucky underscore roberts
07:54 - the second to last post i made actually
07:57 - let me back up a little bit so a couple
08:00 - of days ago i asked what do you want to
08:02 - learn in 2021
08:04 - since well i wanted to know what you
08:06 - guys thought since
08:07 - those were pretty much the tutorials i
08:09 - was planning on making
08:11 - and for those of you who don't feel like
08:13 - going all the way over to twitter
08:15 - python was first surprisingly and i say
08:18 - surprisingly not because the community
08:21 - is uh you know familiar with python
08:24 - but mainly because i taught a lot of
08:26 - python before so i figured you guys
08:28 - would be sick of it
08:29 - but python was first and again this was
08:31 - just the results from the poll
08:33 - they're not anything like uh i'm
08:34 - committed to creating these tutorials or
08:36 - i haven't decided anything yet
08:38 - i just want to you know read you guys
08:41 - the results
08:42 - number two you guys will be happy to see
08:45 - is
08:45 - flutter number three i'm just going to
08:48 - read them out i'm going to say one two
08:50 - three
08:50 - all right python flutter docker
08:53 - django aws kubernetes react native
08:57 - react in ai and after that's blockchain
09:01 - javascript machine learning
09:02 - typescript and yada yada so on and so
09:05 - forth
09:06 - but flutter is definitely on the menu as
09:09 - is docker
09:10 - and aws python and django i did
09:14 - teach that before if there's
09:17 - debating whether i want to teach
09:20 - that again i mean if you guys would like
09:23 - me to teach that
09:24 - then yeah i guess uh rocking with that
09:31 - all right hold on read through comments
09:32 - reading through comments
09:36 - how to concentrate and have patience
09:39 - while learning
09:40 - so this is um
09:44 - okay i need to find a way to like
09:47 - bookmark these comments or something i
09:50 - as i'm answering i see all these other
09:52 - questions go past and in my head i'm
09:54 - like i'm gonna miss that i'm gonna miss
09:56 - that
09:56 - but uh okay one second
10:02 - okay how to concentrate and have
10:04 - patience while
10:05 - learning so i think the
10:09 - reason why a lot of people have trouble
10:10 - concentrating and having patience while
10:12 - learning
10:13 - is because the thing that they're trying
10:15 - to learn doesn't have a lot of meaning
10:18 - to them
10:19 - in other words whenever i was in
10:22 - school high school i had to learn about
10:24 - history and then i had to read books for
10:27 - english class
10:28 - and the fact that i had to do it rather
10:30 - than i wanted to do it
10:31 - it just it was just like okay i just got
10:34 - to do this to complete an assignment
10:36 - or whenever they teach you math in
10:38 - school they're like figure out this
10:39 - equation and then
10:40 - answer on your test or on your homework
10:43 - and in my mind i was like
10:44 - what's the point of this when am i ever
10:46 - going to use this equation
10:48 - uh it just feels like i'm like i'm a
10:50 - function i get some input and i got to
10:52 - do some output or else i get in trouble
10:53 - by my mom or whatever
10:55 - but um the reason i say all this is
10:57 - because
10:58 - with without that reason and say
11:02 - what does this matter what am i doing it
11:03 - for there's no
11:05 - purpose there's no uh nothing to attach
11:07 - it to on your mind because you have
11:08 - nothing to relate it to
11:10 - so whenever i am learning a new language
11:14 - or new technology of course i have the
11:16 - purpose to teach you guys
11:17 - but aside from that it's not
11:21 - i don't really think of things like uh
11:23 - learning in this way or i have to do
11:25 - this
11:25 - to do this what i usually do whenever
11:28 - i'm learning a new technology
11:30 - is something like this i want to build a
11:33 - digital currency
11:34 - because i want to create a better
11:37 - economy and i want to work on this
11:39 - program with everyone for my community
11:41 - now that's what i'm gonna do and that's
11:44 - my focus
11:45 - that's my only focus my dream what i'm
11:47 - passionate about so on and so forth
11:49 - now on that journey of getting to there
11:52 - i know that i'm gonna have to read
11:53 - through documentation i'm gonna have to
11:55 - understand
11:56 - concepts that i didn't learn before but
11:58 - unlike before
11:59 - when i was in high school and having to
12:01 - go through each of these things
12:02 - i'm still doing the exact same thing i
12:04 - have to learn math i have to learn
12:06 - new languages i have to learn this and
12:07 - that but
12:09 - it's not about that learning it's just
12:10 - things that you do naturally
12:13 - on the way to creating this digital
12:15 - currency or this project
12:17 - and a side story on this is that
12:22 - when i first moved down to north
12:24 - carolina and
12:25 - i had a job like um i had to mow
12:29 - like uh police departments and fire
12:31 - stations in like
12:33 - uh like the soccer fields that kids
12:36 - played at
12:37 - so i was just like uh a landscaper
12:39 - basically
12:40 - i worked with uh two people notably i
12:42 - worked with a lot of people but in this
12:44 - story we'll just stick with those two
12:45 - people
12:47 - one guy he hated coming to work every
12:48 - day and he's like ah
12:50 - another day another dollar that's what
12:52 - he always said
12:53 - and another guy kelvin he's like man
12:56 - after this week gonna get that ps3 and
12:59 - so
13:00 - you know got the ps5 now but i actually
13:03 - don't even know if it was the ps3 it was
13:04 - one of those consoles back then
13:06 - but he was always looking ahead to
13:10 - what he could do uh after like what was
13:12 - the purpose of work so on and so forth
13:14 - and i was like huh that's uh pretty
13:17 - interesting
13:18 - it's both of these people including
13:20 - myself
13:21 - we're coming in and going to work every
13:23 - single day we're doing the same exact
13:25 - thing
13:25 - but one guy was upset and depressed the
13:29 - whole time
13:29 - in another one in the exact same
13:31 - situation was just always looking
13:33 - forward to things
13:34 - so i don't know it's just uh
13:38 - the way that i learn it's not that i
13:40 - ever have to go through docs
13:42 - or learn something in a book it's just
13:44 - that these are just things
13:45 - to get me one step closer to what i'm
13:48 - concentrated on
13:49 - it's just um it's not so much learning
13:53 - anymore or having to do anything
13:55 - it's uh just a different mindset i
13:56 - suppose
13:58 - okay miss about 5 000 comments so let me
14:01 - scroll up
14:04 - what are you up to now regarding the
14:07 - channel like blockchain
14:09 - machine learning and web stuff so yes
14:12 - the channel
14:12 - got a lot of stuff planned um i wanna
14:16 - i finally have time okay let me just
14:18 - back up
14:19 - so on november 5th whenever i release
14:22 - the video
14:23 - there were a lot of people um who came
14:26 - into the project right away
14:28 - a lot more than i expected and
14:31 - let me kind of close this as well
14:35 - so a lot of more people came on to the
14:37 - project than
14:38 - i expected and it was just really um
14:41 - overwhelming
14:42 - so in a good way by the way so people
14:45 - would come on and message me and say hey
14:46 - bucky uh i want to join the project
14:49 - this is my background so on and so forth
14:51 - and as i was responding to them
14:53 - i could hear on my little slack bot
14:56 - other people coming in or uh
14:59 - sending me messages i'm like man i am
15:02 - never gonna get through these
15:04 - and then at the end of the night at like
15:06 - 1 30 2 in the morning i finally got
15:07 - through all my messages i'm like
15:09 - okay tomorrow i can go and finally
15:12 - uh start on my twitter messages since
15:14 - this was all on slack
15:16 - and then i would wake up open my slack
15:18 - prepare to go to twitter and there'd be
15:20 - like 150 new messages on slack and i was
15:22 - like
15:23 - oh man never going to get through this
15:25 - but um
15:26 - yeah so the point of the story is
15:29 - essentially
15:30 - i finally have some time now now that
15:33 - that new traffic kind of died down
15:34 - and i want to get through the digital
15:36 - currency videos which i'm
15:38 - hoping to rip out pretty quick and then
15:40 - after that i want to make a series on
15:43 - the account manager
15:44 - the desktop client that you use since a
15:46 - lot of people are having some trouble
15:47 - with that
15:48 - since it is a brand new piece of
15:50 - software of course so
15:52 - i want to teach that and then on the
15:55 - 19th i think i'm flying back to new york
15:58 - to see my family
16:00 - that's the plan for now with this virus
16:02 - thing going around everything's uh
16:04 - changing pretty quickly but
16:06 - i am going to um finish writing my
16:08 - docker tutorials my aws tutorials
16:11 - i'm going to be writing flutter
16:12 - tutorials i'm i'm not going to have my
16:14 - computers around since i'm
16:16 - since uh i film on these big imacs
16:20 - and what is this
16:24 - ah a little debate going on in the chat
16:27 - so i'm not gonna have these but what i'm
16:29 - gonna have am
16:31 - i am gonna have is a lot of time to uh
16:34 - finish writing my tutorials which
16:36 - actually takes the bulk of the time
16:38 - whenever i'm creating videos
16:40 - just because i need to make sure to have
16:41 - a general outline
16:43 - and then i need to make sure on each
16:45 - tutorial i have bullet points of what i
16:47 - want to cover
16:48 - just so i make sure that i don't want to
16:50 - um miss anything or skip over anything
16:53 - so that takes the majority of the time
16:56 - and then when i come back
16:57 - in the beginning of 2021 in january
17:00 - i can pretty much just pump out a bunch
17:02 - of those tutorials so
17:04 - docker aws and flutter coming first and
17:07 - then
17:08 - and then i'm essentially going to wait
17:09 - and see what you guys say mostly
17:11 - listening to the polls uh so on and so
17:13 - forth
17:15 - wow these answers are way too long okay
17:18 - uh
17:18 - scroll down scroll down
17:24 - okay how to increase
17:27 - logical skills for programming this is
17:29 - actually interesting
17:31 - question
17:35 - this is uh something i never thought
17:37 - about
17:41 - i guess that um so so one thing
17:44 - it's kind of the stupid standard answer
17:46 - but just uh
17:47 - practice lots of practice and another
17:51 - thing
17:51 - that i noticed throughout my programming
17:54 - career
17:55 - one thing that separates the really good
17:57 - programmers from the
17:59 - junior programmers that is pretty
18:01 - apparent
18:02 - is whenever they have a new feature to
18:04 - work on or a new little
18:05 - project the more senior developers
18:10 - they take a lot of time to plan
18:14 - they spend a lot of time either on a
18:15 - whiteboard or a notebook and by the time
18:17 - their fingers touch the keyboard
18:19 - they know exactly what they're gonna do
18:21 - uh it's pretty much just
18:24 - writing the solution as fast as you can
18:25 - type of course there may be some
18:27 - issues that they come across but more or
18:29 - less so much goes into planning and
18:32 - understanding exactly what you're
18:33 - building
18:34 - before you start writing the code where
18:36 - with
18:37 - junior developers they get a problem
18:40 - it can be like um an interview challenge
18:43 - or even like a feature later on when
18:45 - they get hired or when they're first
18:47 - starting out
18:48 - and whenever they do they just hop right
18:50 - into the code right into the code
18:51 - and pretty quickly right after that they
18:53 - usually get stuck or say
18:55 - i have to rewrite this rewrite this and
18:58 - i think
18:59 - what's happening in the reason that
19:02 - uh i guess with this digital currency
19:04 - thing i spent months and months and
19:05 - months playing them before my fingers
19:07 - ever touched the keyboard
19:08 - is that whenever you just start coding
19:12 - right away
19:12 - you're kind of looking at things uh one
19:14 - step at a time
19:16 - so if there's ten steps you say i'm
19:17 - gonna do step one and then step two
19:19 - but what it doesn't allow is to see the
19:24 - system as a whole
19:25 - and say okay so this is the individual
19:28 - pieces kind of like that reading
19:29 - comprehension
19:30 - if you guys were here for the earlier
19:32 - part of the stream
19:33 - but not only can you understand the
19:35 - individual pieces but you can understand
19:37 - how everything fits together
19:39 - and then if things don't fit when you're
19:41 - looking at things from a big picture
19:43 - you can go back and kind of tweak things
19:44 - move it around
19:46 - but um i i don't know if that was the
19:50 - answer of the logical skills for
19:52 - programming
19:53 - but by taking the time to plan things
19:56 - out thoroughly
19:57 - uh kind of just with a notebook a
19:59 - notebook and pen or a whiteboard
20:01 - it i feel will improve almost all of
20:04 - your projects
20:06 - all right pretty cool huh i don't know
20:10 - what that was referring to
20:11 - but i'm guessing that it was cool
20:15 - all righty
20:16 - [Music]
20:18 - where can i notify you about a security
20:21 - vulnerability
20:22 - you can uh send me a private message on
20:24 - slack
20:27 - uh hi daddy
20:31 - skip that one all right
20:35 - let's see what else we got
20:39 - can you do bitcoin for complete
20:42 - beginners so caleb is actually making a
20:46 - uh
20:46 - blockchain for beginners tutorial series
20:49 - for the new boston
20:51 - however he is waiting on a payment
20:54 - library
20:54 - that we haven't had time to develop yet
20:57 - so
21:00 - i wanna wait and see for his series to
21:02 - come out and see what he covered
21:04 - and then i'll kind of let the community
21:06 - decide if they want more
21:07 - if they want less if they like that if
21:09 - not so we're rocking with that
21:12 - how long will this stream be i have no
21:14 - idea it's already uh way longer than i
21:16 - expected i really just wanted to do this
21:18 - stream to um
21:20 - test out this uh this new software that
21:23 - i was using in the stream
21:25 - so there really is nothing
21:28 - nothing planned or important for this
21:30 - stream so uh
21:32 - yeah i need to know about the obsession
21:36 - with tuna so another fun fact for you
21:39 - guys
21:40 - is that whenever i started using bacon
21:43 - and tuna in my tutorials and i'm sure if
21:45 - you guys follow me on
21:46 - twitter you already know where this is
21:48 - going but i
21:50 - actually didn't start using
21:53 - the words bacon and tuna in my tutorials
21:55 - to be funny even though you know it is
21:56 - kind of funny i started using it because
21:59 - whenever
22:00 - i was learning programming for the very
22:02 - first time
22:03 - i would go through these books and teach
22:05 - them about
22:10 - so i would go through these books and
22:11 - learning about classes and functions and
22:13 - variables
22:14 - and these variables would be named like
22:16 - var num equals five
22:18 - and i would see these two things like
22:20 - var num i go is one of these like
22:22 - customizable is numb is var
22:26 - like like what's going on and it was
22:28 - hard for me to see
22:29 - like what was a built-in uh keyword and
22:32 - then what was customizable
22:33 - so in my tutorials where i did var bacon
22:37 - equals 18 or something or var tuna
22:39 - equals
22:40 - you know some string i did that because
22:43 - it's very clear to understand what is a
22:45 - built-in reserve keyword and then
22:46 - what is a customizable variable name
22:50 - so that is kind of the reasoning behind
22:52 - that if you guys just thought they're
22:54 - kind of
22:54 - random and i also know that uh
22:58 - a lot of people don't like kind of uh
23:01 - teaching programming that way
23:03 - because in real life you're not supposed
23:06 - to name things bacon
23:08 - however when teaching to someone for the
23:10 - very first time
23:12 - and trying to look at things from their
23:13 - perspective um
23:15 - it is good to use those kind of keywords
23:18 - so even though
23:19 - making actual application i would never
23:20 - suggest using tuna or bacon
23:22 - unless you're making a program about
23:24 - like foods or fish or anything
23:26 - but um yeah there you go
23:32 - oh let's see la la
23:37 - how does one
23:42 - obsession with tuna
23:45 - where have you been still like look like
23:47 - a college kid
23:49 - thank you i feel like i'm about 80 years
23:51 - old stress out from a lot of different
23:53 - projects uh
23:55 - this digital currency one got going on
23:58 - which is a pretty big one but i'm
24:00 - feeling
24:01 - really good about it python is good for
24:04 - people i suggest python i love it seems
24:06 - to be growing strong and also one of the
24:08 - most
24:09 - well liked wait not just the voice
24:12 - i am not a [ __ ] he's my daddy again
24:16 - okay interesting uh oh
24:19 - i should quit college okay got it thanks
24:23 - so this is actually a very interesting
24:26 - question so
24:29 - one i would say that you should probably
24:30 - never take my advice for
24:32 - anything at all so that's my little
24:34 - disclaimer
24:35 - um i i don't recommend
24:39 - quitting college overall it's just a
24:41 - general piece of advice
24:43 - what i would recommend is for anyone
24:47 - in in life really to figure out
24:51 - where you want to be and where you're
24:53 - trying to go and then
24:54 - for yourself independently ask yourself
24:58 - is college the best way to get there
25:01 - and for a lot of professions whether it
25:03 - is um
25:04 - being a doctor or a lawyer uh dropping
25:06 - out of college is not a good idea at all
25:09 - for being a programmer and for wanting
25:11 - to build something unique
25:13 - and for wanting to focus your time and
25:17 - energy on
25:18 - learning about different different
25:19 - software and technology
25:22 - versus going to college and learning
25:24 - about science or gym class
25:26 - then it can be a consideration
25:30 - and another thing is that
25:36 - well i guess i'm always a little weary
25:40 - to give advice like this because
25:43 - i know that what worked out for me may
25:46 - not work out for
25:47 - um other people so i
25:51 - i really am hesitant to uh you know
25:54 - advocate for dropping out of school just
25:56 - because even saying that
25:57 - it seems like a silly thing to suggest
26:01 - but for myself it was even now i feel
26:05 - uh the right choice for me 100 but
26:08 - it's hard to give advice for other
26:09 - people because i don't know your
26:11 - situation
26:15 - all right all right
26:18 - salesforce commerce cloud
26:22 - uh so to anneal bk
26:26 - asking about salesforce commerce cloud
26:28 - actually
26:29 - never uh use that software um
26:34 - familiar with it but i would not be the
26:37 - best person to teach that i'm afraid
26:42 - all right all right wow
26:46 - lots of comments about that
26:49 - okay here we go the new boston how long
26:52 - to learn
26:54 - python so this is uh interesting as well
26:57 - because when there
27:01 - there's never really a time where you
27:03 - can say i learned this language
27:05 - or i didn't learn it yet the moment you
27:08 - pick up a book and understand the first
27:10 - line of a python
27:11 - uh tutorial then you learn python kind
27:14 - of
27:15 - like learning a language okay i took
27:18 - spanish
27:18 - in high school and i know how to say
27:20 - like uh my name
27:22 - and i know how to say like donald
27:24 - biblioteca like where's the library but
27:26 - i don't
27:27 - know spanish or maybe i do now even
27:30 - people who
27:31 - even myself who am a native english
27:34 - speaker
27:35 - there's like 90 language i have no idea
27:37 - what those
27:38 - words are probably so can i say that i
27:40 - know it
27:41 - so it's always this fuzzy thing where
27:44 - uh myself who's been writing python for
27:47 - 10 years
27:48 - more than that i guess um there
27:52 - are there's a vast majority of the
27:53 - language that i i don't know
27:56 - so it's uh how long to learn something
28:01 - it's gradual it happens over time and
28:04 - it never stops you can never stop
28:06 - getting better
28:08 - toothbrush or headphone or what
28:11 - this is a toothbrush actually like the
28:15 - whenever i'm making the tutorial brush
28:17 - the old teeth
28:20 - okay do you feel like the cs field in
28:22 - general is becoming flooded to me
28:24 - in school the cs major is such an
28:26 - impacted
28:27 - major so
28:31 - becoming flooded um i don't
28:36 - it depends on your perspective because
28:38 - is it just like are too many people
28:39 - learning cs uh i wouldn't say that
28:42 - because if lots of people are interested
28:44 - in cs then they should learn it they
28:46 - should go after what they're passionate
28:47 - about
28:49 - as for hiring i think that
28:54 - tech companies specifically they don't
28:57 - care so much
28:58 - about your certifications or your degree
29:00 - versus other areas
29:02 - of um career and industry so on and so
29:05 - forth
29:06 - software companies want the best
29:08 - software developers
29:10 - they want the best software developers
29:12 - in the world because when you release
29:14 - a piece of software there's no
29:15 - certifications or degrees attached to it
29:18 - so people acquire their skills through
29:22 - different means some people go to school
29:24 - and get a master's degree in cs
29:26 - other people go to boot camp and become
29:28 - amazing developers
29:29 - and some people just do independent
29:31 - study and learn on their own
29:33 - and each of these avenues can turn out
29:35 - great for people
29:36 - and each can turn out not so great
29:39 - it really depends on how you learn
29:43 - best as an individual some people need
29:45 - to go to school even for cs because they
29:47 - need that pressure of someone saying
29:49 - okay
29:50 - you need to be uh kind of responsible to
29:52 - complete these assignments
29:54 - and without that pressure they never
29:56 - progress
29:57 - other people it's just um they know
30:00 - exactly what they want to do they know
30:01 - exactly what they
30:02 - want to learn and they don't need help
30:04 - going down that path
30:06 - but whether it's a boot camp whether it
30:09 - is
30:10 - um university whether it is independent
30:12 - learning
30:13 - all of this really depends on what works
30:15 - best for you
30:16 - so i hesitate to give a general answer
30:21 - but hopefully that helped out tooth
30:23 - pressure headphone
30:24 - again huh okay favorite
30:27 - tech stack so i don't know if this has a
30:29 - um
30:32 - uh so the tech stack i like is uh
30:35 - django and then i like django rest
30:37 - framework
30:38 - everything on aws even that that isn't
30:40 - really part of the stack
30:42 - and still a fan of react react in redux
30:46 - been using redux toolkit recently but
30:49 - i mean if you're just gonna like rip out
30:51 - a traditional
30:52 - uh crud application or i mean
30:56 - you really can't go wrong with learning
30:58 - python or django because it's so
31:00 - uh popular nowadays and then on the
31:02 - front end with
31:03 - react javascript i mean that's not dying
31:05 - anytime soon
31:06 - so it's hard to go against that even
31:09 - though i know
31:10 - answering that now everyone is going to
31:13 - you know be debating their own stacks in
31:16 - like what
31:18 - why not angular why not node jango
31:22 - so yeah i uh i blame that person for
31:25 - starting a war
31:26 - in the chat okay and this is jumping
31:30 - around jumping around
31:33 - uh what about big data so i think i
31:36 - might have missed a question here
31:39 - uh something about it or just what about
31:43 - it
31:45 - all right so how is the new boston
31:48 - currency
31:48 - so fast so this is interesting that's
31:50 - what i like talking about
31:55 - all right so there are a couple
31:57 - inefficiencies that i saw
31:59 - actually since this is a stream i guess
32:01 - i uh
32:03 - okay let's just let's just uh answer
32:05 - this question straight up
32:07 - so you know whatever let's just go way
32:11 - back to
32:12 - why i uh created the network and how
32:15 - that came about
32:16 - so whenever i was creating the digital
32:19 - currency i never
32:22 - set out to create a digital currency
32:25 - what i was doing
32:26 - is i was actually um making a simulation
32:29 - about the entire us stock market
32:32 - and what i saw
32:35 - is that there's an opportunity if you
32:37 - could figure out the retailers and their
32:38 - suppliers
32:40 - to through earnings see
32:43 - which companies were going to most
32:45 - likely uh
32:47 - have higher earnings than expected and
32:49 - the reason
32:50 - uh pretty simple is for this if google
32:52 - announced
32:53 - 10 more earnings then that means that
32:56 - more or less their company was growing
32:58 - by
32:58 - 10 so therefore since they needed to
33:02 - you know buy additional uh merchandise
33:05 - buy additional computers hire more
33:06 - employees expand their operations
33:09 - then that means that whoever they
33:11 - purchased their supplies from whether it
33:13 - was intel whether it was from amd
33:15 - so on and so forth that they would most
33:17 - likely have a 10
33:19 - earnings increase as well so
33:22 - since i was finding this correlation
33:24 - what i do is i mapped out a simulation
33:26 - with all these different companies and
33:28 - then i saw
33:29 - i essentially needed to figure out how
33:31 - the money was flowing between these
33:33 - companies to get this correlation
33:35 - so the money is a little bit more
33:38 - complicated
33:40 - than just seeing where it's flowing from
33:42 - company to company because money doesn't
33:44 - flow that way in real life
33:45 - what happens in the v1 of the simulation
33:49 - is i figured that i needed to add
33:51 - employees
33:52 - so when and break this down even uh more
33:56 - simply is that whenever a company
33:58 - pays employees those are people who can
34:01 - go to
34:02 - different parts of the economy and buy
34:03 - something in other companies
34:05 - so it essentially is a company to
34:07 - employees they spend it at another
34:09 - company
34:09 - and then that company can hire more
34:12 - employees or
34:13 - you know pay their employees and the
34:15 - cycle continues
34:16 - now breaking this down into its most
34:19 - simple form
34:20 - i thought in my mind never went to
34:22 - college but things kind of work like
34:24 - this
34:25 - where whenever i have a dollar and i
34:28 - give it to you that is minus one dollar
34:31 - for me
34:32 - and plus one dollar for you so in the
34:35 - end
34:35 - i figured it always equals zero and then
34:38 - when you expand it to companies playing
34:40 - them
34:40 - employees and their employees go and you
34:42 - know they pay taxes and stuff but then
34:44 - they buy other goods
34:46 - in my mind i figured the total economy
34:48 - always equaled zero
34:50 - but then after looking at things i saw
34:54 - okay whenever i plug real numbers into
34:56 - the simulation
34:57 - that it didn't equal zero or not even
35:00 - close
35:01 - and what i didn't account for
35:04 - in the end after you know mapping a lot
35:07 - of things out
35:08 - is how the money got into the economy in
35:10 - the first place
35:11 - that whenever i pay you a dollar that
35:13 - dollar needed to come
35:15 - from somewhere in the in the first place
35:18 - so
35:19 - i had to essentially say okay in this
35:21 - economy where does the money come from
35:23 - oh it's the banks and they
35:24 - loan it out and well how did the banks
35:27 - get the money how does this system work
35:29 - oh central banks do this and oh that's
35:32 - kind of a unique system because
35:35 - huh apparently what's happening is banks
35:38 - are giving out
35:39 - people loans and that's how money gets
35:41 - into the system
35:42 - and then loans are essentially promises
35:45 - to pay back
35:46 - more money than you initially receive
35:48 - however breaking things down
35:50 - let's just say that there are three
35:51 - people in the economy and
35:53 - they each took a loan out for a dollar
35:56 - now
35:56 - if there is 10 interest on that loan at
35:58 - the end of the year
36:00 - they would each have to pay back a
36:01 - dollar 10 cents but after a year
36:05 - what you would essentially have is three
36:07 - people
36:09 - [Music]
36:11 - pen cap dropped
36:15 - no i did not watch that but you would
36:17 - essentially have three people
36:18 - who took out a dollar loan so there are
36:21 - three dollars in the economy
36:22 - however if they're all standing around
36:24 - each other they would say wait a minute
36:27 - so we as a community owe three dollars
36:30 - and thirty cents
36:31 - to these banks but there are only three
36:33 - dollars in the total economy
36:36 - so and this again is a very simplified
36:40 - version the economy is a lot more
36:41 - complex
36:42 - than this but um essentially that's what
36:45 - i was
36:46 - uh trying to figure out and then i saw
36:49 - that
36:50 - an alternative solution was bitcoin and
36:53 - way back when i didn't understand what
36:54 - the hype of all the uh
36:56 - blockchain was about since
36:59 - it seemed like this technology that was
37:01 - just technology for the sake of
37:03 - technology
37:04 - and let me uh get rid of this right here
37:09 - so i kind of saw bitcoin similar it's
37:11 - like 3d tv
37:12 - where okay that's pretty cool but
37:15 - okay like it's cool technology but is it
37:19 - gonna take off
37:20 - do we really need it is it really
37:22 - meaningful in any way
37:23 - uh i couldn't really connect it in my
37:25 - head so
37:26 - after understanding this in the problem
37:28 - with a simulation that i was trying to
37:30 - figure out which ended up
37:32 - being a lot more than a bug fix because
37:34 - i ended up having to figure out
37:37 - how different parts of the economy work
37:38 - so on and so forth
37:40 - i saw that okay so bitcoin is actually a
37:43 - pretty cool solution to this
37:45 - but if that's the case and people have a
37:47 - choice between these two systems
37:50 - why are they choosing this over uh
37:52 - bitcoin or blockchain or anything
37:54 - i don't mean seem like a advocate for
37:57 - bitcoin or whatever since i know a lot
37:58 - of people
37:59 - get pretty annoying on all that but um i
38:02 - was just
38:02 - trying to figure out in my mind it was
38:05 - just a better solution
38:06 - but why if that was the case it wasn't
38:08 - more widespread
38:10 - and one of the big things even though
38:12 - there are lots of things
38:14 - is that the transaction
38:18 - times were a big barrier so i know right
38:20 - now we have the lightning network and
38:21 - there are lots of other improvements
38:24 - but essentially no one
38:28 - i noticed was going to go to uh
38:31 - a deli and buy a cup of coffee or
38:33 - sandwich or whatever
38:34 - and be waiting there for 10 minutes
38:36 - while their transaction
38:38 - was you know pending waiting to get
38:40 - approved so
38:41 - i knew that the first thing was the
38:43 - transaction times that i needed to
38:45 - speed up or at least that was um the
38:48 - barrier that i saw which would
38:49 - eventually
38:50 - lead me to uh start creating this
38:52 - project
38:53 - another thing was the incentive
38:57 - where more or less in this economy
38:59 - people will
39:01 - will do what you pay them to where they
39:04 - build the things
39:05 - uh based on economic incentive they
39:07 - choose jobs based on that
39:09 - so on and so forth now in the bitcoin
39:12 - blockchain that incentive comes from
39:16 - mining blocks it comes from the fact
39:18 - that not only do you validate
39:19 - transactions which is useful
39:21 - uh it's the main goal of the miners but
39:24 - so much of that time and energy
39:26 - is spent solving this puzzle it's spent
39:29 - devoted to something that has absolutely
39:31 - nothing to do
39:32 - with verifying the transactions itself
39:35 - so in the bitcoin blockchain and this
39:38 - all ties back to that original question
39:39 - by the way
39:40 - one sec
39:44 - in the bitcoin blockchain what you
39:45 - essentially have is a network of miners
39:48 - and these miners each get transactions
39:51 - and they bundle them together into a
39:53 - block
39:54 - and then they validate those
39:55 - transactions pretty quickly
39:57 - but then after that what they do is they
40:00 - solve a puzzle
40:01 - a puzzle that takes around 10 minutes on
40:03 - average to solve
40:05 - and the reason that they solve that has
40:07 - nothing to do with validating the
40:09 - transactions
40:10 - has to do with more of a human problem
40:12 - and that is
40:13 - if you picture it like this if there
40:16 - were
40:18 - a lot of students sitting at desks and
40:21 - you were
40:22 - watching like in a football stadium or
40:23 - something then
40:26 - if you just had each of those students
40:28 - with pencil and paper
40:29 - validating a transaction and in a live
40:32 - network
40:32 - they would just stand up and shout every
40:34 - time they validated
40:35 - one then it would just be mayhem there'd
40:38 - just be validated validated validate you
40:40 - couldn't understand who's first you kind
40:41 - of understand
40:42 - if they're valid communication would
40:44 - just be a mess
40:46 - so with that in mind instead of all
40:49 - these
40:50 - uh kids i don't know why they have to be
40:52 - kids just imagining myself
40:53 - in an elementary school but now imagine
40:56 - each of these kids validating a set of
40:58 - transactions or doing a test or
41:00 - something
41:01 - and then after that you give them a big
41:04 - crossword puzzle to fill out or maybe a
41:06 - word search or something maybe a sudoku
41:08 - problem
41:09 - and this is a challenging one that takes
41:12 - on
41:12 - average 10 minutes to solve well now
41:15 - instead of everyone shouting shout and
41:16 - shouting
41:17 - they solve these transactions and then
41:19 - they
41:20 - have to solve this and then the
41:22 - communication becomes more spread out
41:25 - at the end of 9 minutes 10 minutes
41:27 - somewhere around there
41:28 - a kid's going to stand up and said i
41:29 - validated these transactions
41:31 - and i solved the puzzle and instead of
41:33 - everyone shouting at once
41:35 - now those people all those other
41:37 - students are able to determine okay
41:39 - this person was first that communication
41:42 - is pretty clear
41:43 - now we can just validate it pretty
41:44 - quickly and then move on to the next
41:46 - puzzle
41:47 - so that is what i saw
41:50 - but what was interesting in all of this
41:54 - is that aside from that earlier part
41:57 - that i mentioned
41:58 - of everyone solving this puzzle
42:00 - validating transactions so on and so
42:01 - forth
42:02 - i noticed that there was a moment in
42:04 - time
42:05 - where one of these students in my mind
42:08 - stood up and then the entire network
42:11 - agreed that this was a student that we
42:13 - go with this was the one
42:15 - so in that moment an entire network of
42:18 - computers
42:19 - of nodes that were controlled by people
42:21 - who had no idea who each other were
42:23 - they were able to agree on something
42:26 - and the bottleneck and all of that was
42:29 - this puzzle
42:30 - was this puzzle that needed to be done
42:32 - because they needed to figure out
42:34 - uh who was first or who should be able
42:37 - to validate that block
42:39 - now kind of translating that to a couple
42:44 - problems i
42:44 - identified is i saw that the efficiency
42:49 - inefficiency in the network uh came from
42:51 - a couple of things
42:52 - so the technical technological
42:54 - inefficiency
42:56 - was first of all within each individual
42:59 - minor
43:01 - 99 of the time is spent
43:04 - doing something completely unrelated to
43:06 - the transaction validation
43:08 - you got a about less than one percent
43:10 - validating transactions
43:12 - and then 99 percent of time is just
43:13 - spent doing this puzzle
43:15 - so if we could cut out the puzzle that
43:16 - would be great another thing
43:18 - is the network inefficiency where in
43:22 - the bitcoin network you essentially have
43:24 - these miners all around the world trying
43:26 - to mine a block because when you mine it
43:27 - you get that bitcoin reward
43:30 - now whenever one miner solves the puzzle
43:33 - what happens is they say yo these uh
43:36 - transactions are valid
43:37 - in everyone else's work just get tossed
43:40 - out the window
43:41 - so with one minor there's just so much
43:45 - little work that actually mattered
43:46 - and everything else was just wasted more
43:49 - or less
43:50 - now the reason back to this question
43:53 - is why the new boston network is so fast
43:57 - is in the bitcoin blockchain what they
43:59 - do
44:00 - is every single block every single um
44:03 - puzzle that they solve they essentially
44:06 - say
44:07 - look i solved it and then everyone else
44:09 - agrees on that
44:10 - now whenever you solve block after
44:12 - blockout for block you have to agree
44:14 - as a network on black block after block
44:16 - after block
44:17 - and there are transactions happening
44:19 - very quickly and it takes a long time
44:22 - now if instead of having all these
44:25 - miners
44:26 - and they validate these blocks and then
44:28 - you have to decide on each of these
44:31 - is this one legit is this one legit is
44:32 - this the one legit if you take that
44:34 - consensus
44:35 - and move it down a layer where you say
44:38 - we don't have to agree on every single
44:40 - block instead
44:42 - let's just go ahead and agree on the
44:44 - minor
44:45 - that we want to choose that we trust the
44:47 - most to validate these blocks
44:49 - because we're essentially taking all
44:51 - that uh waste that happened before
44:53 - and removing it to the last second where
44:56 - if that network in the bitcoin
44:58 - uh if that decision in the bitcoin
45:01 - network that consensus
45:03 - was reached on the individual block then
45:05 - we know a network of computers can reach
45:07 - a consensus about something
45:08 - now instead of reaching about the
45:10 - individual block why not reach it
45:12 - on the node and then we can say this
45:15 - node is the one
45:16 - that we agree that we reach a consensus
45:18 - on is a node that we trust
45:20 - now we can essentially just send all
45:23 - transactions to them
45:25 - and they can validate it as fast as they
45:28 - can
45:28 - so as soon as they come in there's no
45:30 - need to wait for anything else so on and
45:31 - so
45:32 - forth and for these other
45:35 - miners they essentially turn into uh
45:37 - validators
45:38 - where they aren't just like peaceing out
45:40 - saying you know you don't need me
45:41 - anymore they're doing a couple key
45:43 - things
45:43 - they are backing up the primary
45:46 - validator in case it over goes down
45:48 - and they are also double checking their
45:51 - homework essentially
45:52 - so they just don't blindly accept this
45:54 - they're revalidating each and every
45:56 - single one
45:57 - so by doing that we essentially
46:00 - eliminate
46:01 - the need for a puzzle and we eliminate
46:03 - the network inefficiency as well
46:06 - because well for all of those reasons
46:09 - so that is uh another
46:13 - man got a lot of these comments so that
46:15 - is essentially why we are able to uh
46:17 - speed up
46:18 - the um block times so quick because we
46:22 - don't have to agree on every
46:23 - block time we have to agree on a trusted
46:26 - minor
46:26 - and then they are going to be the ones
46:28 - validating all of these transactions
46:30 - and if they ever try to lie or cheat or
46:32 - steal or anything
46:34 - you have all of these confirmation
46:35 - validators checking them and they are
46:37 - essentially going to broadcast the
46:39 - moment they try to
46:40 - you know tweak anything by one little
46:42 - bite
46:44 - so it just um leads to a
46:47 - a very interesting and efficient
46:49 - architecture
46:51 - okay let's uh that was way too long i
46:54 - got to speed these up
46:57 - uh let's see how to avoid burnout
47:00 - of learning so many things um
47:06 - yeah i think that kind of comes down to
47:10 - you aren't you don't get burnt out by
47:13 - learning things that you enjoy to learn
47:15 - you kind of get burned out by doing
47:16 - things that you have to do
47:18 - so a lot of burnout happens because of
47:22 - the environment rather than
47:24 - individual topic what about
47:27 - database i think i missed the earlier
47:30 - question there
47:35 - views on ethical hacking
47:38 - uh ethical hacking is yeah it's uh
47:42 - like white hat pen testing just a
47:45 - different area of
47:46 - security did you write a
47:49 - 10k reader
47:53 - all right what do you say about aws and
47:56 - cloud computing should i
47:57 - go for network automation i am a network
48:00 - admin uh yeah it seems to be um where
48:04 - the world is shifting aws cloud
48:05 - computing
48:06 - is not going anywhere anytime soon
48:11 - okay let's see let's see let's see
48:18 - man
48:21 - stream is just me trying to read through
48:23 - questions
48:24 - are you a freelancer or what i am not a
48:27 - freelancer
48:29 - super chat question question i saw super
48:32 - chat on youtube but i'm i'm
48:34 - actually not sure what it is
48:37 - okay wow way way late on this
48:41 - um
48:47 - decentralization yes yes
48:52 - never knew how you look like
48:56 - this is it
49:02 - where did you learn these programming
49:03 - languages from
49:05 - you look so pretty cool uh-huh why thank
49:07 - you
49:08 - and um yeah most of them
49:12 - most times when i was learning
49:15 - programming languages
49:16 - so i used to just uh buy the top rated
49:19 - book off
49:20 - amazon and uh sometimes i would just
49:23 - like buy two or three cents like they
49:26 - only show you a little preview
49:27 - and back then uh whenever i was first
49:30 - starting out ebooks or kindles weren't
49:32 - that prevalent
49:33 - so just um yeah just going through books
49:37 - and
49:38 - and studying and now what i like to do
49:40 - is i like to watch uh
49:42 - video courses stephen grider is probably
49:45 - my favorite uh
49:46 - instructor i love the way he teaches
49:49 - and any course that he teaches i would
49:51 - uh highly recommend
49:53 - okay see
49:59 - superchats are where megaballer
50:01 - millionaire youtube's get donations from
50:03 - viewers very cool millionaires
50:07 - this is interesting where mega baller
50:09 - millionaire youtubers get donations from
50:11 - viewers
50:12 - it sounds like those are the last people
50:14 - that would need donations
50:16 - but um yeah sounds interesting
50:24 - nonetheless
50:26 - blockchain what if the trusted minor
50:27 - gets corrupted or it goes rogue
50:30 - what can you do sorry for spamming the
50:32 - question no it's a good one
50:33 - because it definitely uh can happen
50:37 - the primary validator is one that is a
50:39 - single source of truth in validating all
50:41 - transactions in the network
50:42 - for optimization reasons primarily now
50:45 - the moment that they try to
50:47 - cheat and uh the most likely thing they
50:50 - can
50:51 - try to mess with the network a bunch of
50:52 - different ways but the most
50:54 - likely reason that they would cheat
50:56 - their incentive is just
50:57 - adding additional money to their own
50:59 - account so
51:00 - instead of me paying you 50 coins they
51:03 - would either try to pay themselves 50
51:05 - coins
51:06 - so when that happens uh through the use
51:09 - of digital signatures all of the other
51:11 - confirmation validators
51:13 - will notice that it is a invalid
51:15 - transaction
51:17 - and they won't accept that transaction
51:18 - onto their blockchain
51:20 - because all the confirmation validators
51:22 - are continuously trying
51:24 - essentially to um sync to the block
51:27 - or the primary validator of blockchain
51:29 - so essentially when this happens
51:32 - the confirmation validators will reject
51:34 - the primary validator
51:35 - the primary validator will be booted
51:38 - more or less from the network
51:39 - and all these confirmation validators
51:42 - will inform the banks that the primary
51:44 - validator was cheating
51:46 - and through the it's a separate process
51:49 - but essentially
51:50 - the banks move on to the next most
51:52 - trusted confirmation validator
51:55 - now another cool thing is that
51:58 - this process would normally take a long
52:00 - time where
52:01 - uh this primary validators kind of got
52:05 - caught cheating and then every other
52:06 - node in the network had to resync okay
52:08 - what do we do now what do we do now
52:09 - who's the most
52:10 - next trust in but the cool thing about
52:12 - this is that
52:15 - this decision is already in place before
52:18 - that happens
52:19 - so through trust banks are already
52:22 - deciding if the primary validator ever
52:24 - goes offline or is caught cheating so on
52:26 - and so forth
52:27 - they already know what confirmation
52:29 - validator to move to next
52:31 - so that is why even in that process
52:34 - the transition times and the resync of
52:36 - the network happens very quickly
52:39 - okay the even docker bro yes docker
52:42 - tutorials coming
52:45 - right soon let's see
52:50 - this this okay
52:53 - so how can we get coins so coins
52:56 - are earned through contributing to the
52:59 - project
53:00 - so that is where i felt the incentive
53:03 - should be
53:04 - where in different networks where it's
53:06 - mining the incentive comes from
53:09 - building the fastest miner and here
53:12 - the incentive in the value is
53:13 - essentially what you put into it
53:15 - so the entire idea is what you put into
53:18 - it is the value
53:18 - that you should get out and the coins
53:20 - are just a representation of how much
53:22 - you help the network
53:23 - and how much you help the community so
53:25 - you get coins through different things
53:27 - working on projects like if you want to
53:29 - work on a game or
53:30 - analytics tool or anything that
53:32 - integrates with the network
53:34 - you can earn that through project
53:35 - proposals and another thing is you can
53:38 - just work as
53:38 - a weekly contributor and these are
53:41 - things like the front end team the back
53:42 - end team
53:43 - uh seo marketing so on and so forth
53:47 - design
53:48 - uh those types and lastly just
53:51 - completing a one-time task so if you
53:54 - don't want to help out
53:55 - every week and you just want to fix some
53:57 - bugs or make some optimizations
53:59 - then if you go to the website look at
54:00 - the tasks then there are smaller
54:02 - one-time tasks that you can do
54:05 - okay alright
54:11 - client so what clients do you have what
54:13 - operating systems you can run on
54:14 - so our main client is the account
54:16 - manager you can download it from the new
54:18 - boston.com
54:20 - and with that it was built using
54:22 - electron
54:23 - so it works on linux windows and
54:26 - mac os
54:37 - so you can buy up a bunch of coins
54:41 - and control the network so i
54:44 - so this network is not controlled by a
54:47 - proof of stake
54:47 - at all so the amount of money or coins
54:51 - that you have uh doesn't have any
54:54 - influence
55:00 - okay how old am i i think i'm
55:04 - 33 34.
55:09 - this was actually the hardest question
55:13 - oh wow okay this is uh
55:16 - okay bucky meant suffer engineering or
55:19 - cs
55:21 - uh so that's up to you it's uh
55:24 - what you're more interested in gekko
55:27 - question mark
55:31 - yeah coin gecko is cool there might have
55:34 - been a
55:34 - earlier question but okay
55:37 - [Music]
55:39 - okay uh the value basis makes sense what
55:41 - about speculators that just
55:43 - want to buy and sell at higher
55:46 - prices so yes the
55:49 - okay so the value
55:53 - this is another thing where the value of
55:55 - the coin is a
55:56 - difficult concept to explain because
56:00 - a lot of people don't think about uh
56:02 - value of currency in
56:06 - really at all before uh bitcoin they
56:09 - were born into a system where
56:11 - uh currency already existed and with
56:13 - bitcoin what it showed is
56:15 - uh currency doesn't have to be that way
56:17 - the value can come from
56:19 - what you build it into so even with that
56:22 - there are different types of value
56:23 - there are social value their monetary
56:26 - value which i'm sure that you are
56:27 - referring to
56:28 - in the monetary value of this is first
56:31 - going to be determined
56:32 - whenever we start selling goods and
56:34 - services so we're going to start selling
56:37 - uh stickers and t-shirts the new boston
56:40 - on the website in the marketplace
56:41 - whenever that rolls out
56:42 - and then later they're going to go to
56:45 - decentralized exchanges
56:47 - and these decentralized exchanges
56:50 - uh contributors or whoever has coins are
56:53 - going to be able to sell them for
56:55 - other types of currency bitcoin ethereum
56:57 - so on and so forth
56:58 - and the exact value of that we don't
57:00 - know we won't know
57:01 - until the moment where those coins are
57:04 - placed for sale
57:05 - and an agreement is made for one person
57:08 - to exchange their currency
57:09 - for our coins stephen grider where is
57:13 - his courses so he is on
57:14 - udemy i believe uh that's where i get
57:19 - his courses i'm actually i'm actually
57:22 - not sure if he is on
57:23 - youtube or not if so that would be cool
57:25 - but yeah check them out on udemy
57:27 - makes awesome courses and they're uh
57:29 - very in-depth as well
57:30 - [Music]
57:33 - okay what do you think of the future of
57:36 - this crypto
57:37 - i have very uh okay
57:40 - don't uh get everyone's expectations up
57:43 - too high
57:44 - but i am liking
57:47 - what i am seeing a lot we still have um
57:50 - a couple we still have a long way to go
57:53 - but so far
57:54 - things are looking very good and i just
57:56 - see this comment
57:57 - give cat bagel all right
58:00 - [Music]
58:06 - rust as well and
58:09 - okay so i like and rust uh what about
58:13 - sqlite database
58:14 - uh yeah sqlite is pretty cool in memory
58:17 - it's nice to uh just share databases
58:19 - it's really simple for getting started
58:22 - especially locally on like a django
58:24 - project before you port over to
58:27 - postgres or anything like that but uh
58:29 - yeah i'm a fan of it
58:30 - it's probably not a fan in a production
58:32 - setting
58:35 - are you guys using solidity we are not
58:37 - using solidity uh this is
58:39 - not um erc20 compatible this is
58:43 - it's actually a complete rewrite of the
58:47 - blockchain from the ground up however
58:49 - later on whenever we reach out to
58:52 - or get on decentralized exchanges then
58:54 - we will most likely be wrapping it in
58:56 - the erc20 coin
58:58 - and getting on that way
59:03 - what is my rating in chess so i actually
59:05 - used to be
59:06 - really into chess um
59:10 - i can't remember what my rating was i
59:13 - want to say
59:15 - i want to say like uh 1600 1700
59:20 - but uh yeah and then so i was actually
59:24 - climbing climbing and i took chess
59:25 - lessons i love my chess instructor i
59:27 - love chess
59:28 - but after a while i got busy with
59:30 - working some other things and then i
59:32 - want
59:32 - went into a play a little bit later and
59:36 - my rating dipped way down so it's one of
59:37 - those things where if you aren't doing
59:39 - it frequently at least in my experience
59:42 - that uh some of these comments that uh i
59:45 - kind of lost it but
59:46 - i still love chess a lot
59:51 - [Music]
59:54 - all right trying to get an entry-level
59:56 - job programming
59:57 - i learned this and this what other
59:59 - skills and tools
60:01 - must i master i feel stuck so this
60:04 - really depends on
60:06 - what specific language you're trying to
60:08 - get in and
60:10 - i would stick with like um
60:13 - there's no need to learn java and c plus
60:16 - typically you usually stick with uh one
60:19 - or the other kind of like um
60:20 - well i guess it's a little bit different
60:22 - for web development because with
60:24 - the web development you typically need a
60:26 - stack unless they're looking for like
60:28 - strictly back end or front end
60:29 - but it's tough to say because depending
60:33 - on the company that you're trying to
60:34 - apply for
60:35 - in the position um it really depends on
60:39 - what they are looking for but in general
60:42 - i will say that your best bet
60:43 - is to go deep into one language because
60:48 - if you are like an expert in one
60:49 - language you can almost always find a
60:51 - job
60:52 - rather than having a shallow
60:55 - bit of knowledge in a lot of different
60:57 - ones
61:00 - isn't proof of stake arguably better for
61:02 - day-to-day use than
61:04 - proof of work so i would say from
61:07 - day-to-day transactions it definitely
61:08 - makes the network faster
61:11 - uh the concept behind proof of stake
61:13 - where
61:14 - you're essentially rewarding people with
61:16 - more money
61:17 - uh versus proof of work where you're
61:20 - rewarding people for
61:22 - solving puzzles faster not so
61:26 - as far as transaction speed then proof
61:28 - of stake is definitely the way to go
61:36 - this this yeah okay
61:40 - how many youtube channels did i follow
61:44 - uh don't know
61:47 - 100 maybe i followed them uh over time
61:57 - all right so what incentive would
61:59 - someone have
62:00 - in trading their bitcoin for the coins
62:02 - is there an intrinsic value
62:04 - so i guess um the value
62:08 - of each of these it's essentially
62:11 - similar to um
62:12 - bitcoin where the value of that was
62:16 - nothing in the beginning and that's why
62:18 - people pay like millions of bitcoins for
62:19 - pizza or they're just giving them away
62:21 - for free whatever
62:22 - the value of these cryptocurrencies it
62:25 - only comes from the value that you
62:27 - you give it or the value that you build
62:29 - it's the value of the network
62:30 - and the value of currency overall
62:33 - doesn't have any
62:35 - inherent value i mean of course uh gold
62:37 - coins in way back then
62:39 - it's a little bit different but nowadays
62:42 - there's
62:42 - nothing inherently valuable about a
62:45 - dollar bill with
62:47 - a president's head printed on it the
62:49 - only value of currency
62:51 - is for the goods and services that you
62:53 - can exchange for it
62:54 - you can take a dollar bill and you can
62:56 - buy a candy bar or you can hire someone
62:58 - to
62:58 - mow your lawn or something but um the
63:01 - the only real value of currency is what
63:04 - you can exchange it for
63:05 - that has tangible value goods and
63:07 - services
63:10 - uh learn programming say watch my
63:13 - channel
63:15 - react to native
63:20 - all right favorite programming language
63:21 - i would have to go with um
63:26 - i'd have to go with python just because
63:29 - it's well i'm biased
63:31 - it's just my own personal opinion that
63:32 - i'm most familiar with it
63:35 - all right all right all right all right
63:37 - uh let's see
63:40 - what do i think about machine learning
63:43 - um yeah it seems uh useful
63:47 - i always felt like i was unclear on the
63:50 - difference between machine learning and
63:52 - then statistics
63:53 - in like a forward loop essentially even
63:56 - though that's
63:57 - a very over simplification but um
64:01 - yeah lots of math involved in machine
64:03 - learning
64:05 - is my sequel obsolete absolutely not
64:08 - and okay uh kyle had a question up here
64:13 - uh more centralization
64:18 - hmm asciis create more centralization
64:25 - ee that's interesting it's like a
64:28 - decentralized centralization i guess not
64:31 - a typical one
64:32 - but never thought about it like that
64:38 - still better still building racing carts
64:40 - i am not
64:43 - uh let's see
64:48 - okay
64:52 - message retracted that's interesting
64:56 - all right so it looks like i got to the
64:58 - bottom of these
64:59 - all right javascript or python which
65:02 - holds the future
65:04 - uh i think they're gonna be equally
65:07 - valuable
65:08 - i don't see either one of them dying
65:10 - down anywhere in the near future
65:12 - and there's still a lot of development
65:14 - going on with either they're getting
65:16 - better every year
65:17 - faster uh yeah so both of them
65:23 - in our university we're learning c
65:25 - programming language is it good for
65:26 - beginners
65:27 - um so this is interesting because what
65:31 - programming language is good for
65:33 - beginners
65:35 - so i would say that c definitely is not
65:37 - the most
65:38 - easiest one to learn however on the flip
65:41 - side of it
65:42 - you do learn a little bit more lower
65:45 - level
65:45 - in-depth programming concepts so in that
65:49 - way
65:49 - even though there's a bigger barrier to
65:51 - learning it
65:52 - it gives you almost like a more
65:56 - clear picture about programming overall
65:59 - but i guess that's a
66:00 - kind of general in computing where the
66:02 - more low level
66:03 - the more you understand about how like
66:05 - the uh bits move around
66:07 - but of course the closer you are
66:10 - the lower you are then uh not so much
66:13 - uh easy to get started
66:18 - decentralized artificial intelligence
66:21 - hmm
66:21 - now we're getting some good stuff
66:23 - decentralize artificial intelligence
66:25 - decentralize artificial intelligence
66:29 - so i i always thought this where um
66:33 - [Music]
66:34 - and this is an interesting concept as
66:36 - well where whenever you have a cell in
66:38 - your body
66:39 - like your stomach cell or your lung cell
66:41 - or whatever your lung cell
66:43 - has no concept of the lung overall
66:47 - it doesn't know okay i'm doing this i'm
66:49 - doing this so
66:50 - uh there there's this human outside who
66:52 - can like uh breathe or
66:54 - digest food a stomach cell is just like
66:56 - bloop
66:57 - whatever noise they make it's just doing
66:59 - its thing so it doesn't really
67:01 - understand the environment that it's in
67:03 - and even when you put those together
67:05 - your lung overall it doesn't have a
67:07 - brain but still continues to do these
67:09 - things
67:10 - these processes without any over without
67:13 - any understanding
67:14 - of the the body that it's in it's a lung
67:17 - and it just does what a lung does now
67:20 - with that in mind
67:21 - right now we have a lot of different ai
67:24 - and they are specific to certain tests
67:27 - uh
67:27 - image recognition uh making sure that
67:30 - you
67:31 - click uh what was that what was that
67:34 - a movie on netflix called social dilemma
67:38 - pretty much all that stuff with the ai
67:40 - but um
67:44 - whenever this ai starts connecting and
67:47 - starts
67:48 - learning from one another and i think
67:51 - that's going to be
67:53 - pretty interesting and aside from that
67:56 - the reason that i bring up the lung
67:59 - cells so on and so forth is
68:01 - it always felt to me like as human
68:04 - beings there was a drive
68:05 - that we didn't really understand even as
68:07 - kids we want to
68:09 - build things and we want to create
68:11 - things but what's our drive like
68:13 - when i was a kid i used to build these
68:15 - towers out of blocks and
68:16 - i knew in my head that they weren't
68:18 - going to last forever they're just going
68:19 - to be
68:19 - knocked down but still i wanted to build
68:21 - the biggest tower and now i wanted
68:24 - to build the fastest blockchain and do
68:26 - this and that
68:27 - but for all these things i'm doing all
68:30 - these things i'm building putting
68:31 - together figuring it out it's like why
68:34 - what's it
68:34 - what's it matter at the end whether we
68:36 - have a big tower
68:38 - a fast blockchain so on and so forth and
68:41 - it feels like
68:43 - what humans are doing is they're
68:44 - building something that they don't quite
68:46 - comprehend myself included
68:48 - but what i do see is that people are
68:49 - becoming more connected
68:52 - and they're becoming connected faster
68:55 - than ever
68:56 - and even though i
69:00 - i don't know the uh the end of this or
69:02 - the body
69:04 - it's um it's interesting to see
69:07 - how things are tying together with the
69:10 - technology that we're building
69:11 - and these different types of ai and how
69:15 - they do
69:15 - influence us overall now i don't want to
69:18 - get into another social dilemma
69:20 - uh so on and so forth but in terms of
69:23 - artificial consciousness
69:25 - and artificial intelligence
69:26 - decentralization
69:28 - it feels like uh overall we're moving
69:32 - very quickly in a certain direction
69:36 - and it will be very interesting to see
69:38 - what is going to happen in the future
69:41 - [Music]
69:44 - okay uh would you say privacy is
69:47 - important
69:48 - i think this is for me
69:51 - yes uh 1 000
70:00 - okay
70:05 - dynamics 365. actually
70:09 - am not familiar with that
70:15 - pretty interesting customer relationship
70:17 - management okay
70:19 - now i know about it pretty cool funny
70:21 - how ideas spread
70:22 - oh okay i missed a bunch of ones okay
70:28 - privacy
70:32 - uh bug bounty programs yeah i'm a big
70:35 - fan of bug bounty programs
70:42 - uh the pan renter how do you bridge the
70:44 - gap between theory and application i'm
70:46 - stuck
70:47 - knowing how to do things when i actually
70:51 - but not being able to actually do them
70:53 - pan
70:54 - or answer can you um let me see you
70:58 - can you give me a specific example
71:02 - this is an interesting question
71:05 - teach arduino
71:09 - that's interesting as well
71:12 - yes uh who is secret agent paul
71:15 - cool name uh
71:20 - teach arduino so um i'm actually i had a
71:23 - poll on twitter
71:24 - asking people what they want to learn in
71:25 - 2021 i have a couple different topics on
71:28 - the
71:28 - agenda but uh if you want to recommend
71:32 - arduino then yeah that would be
71:35 - definitely
71:36 - a possibility what are your view on
71:39 - blockchain technology i used to not be a
71:41 - fan of blockchain technology at all i
71:43 - didn't see the use in it
71:44 - but now i do see the use in it and i am
71:46 - a huge fan
71:49 - uh any experience in computer vision i
71:52 - do not
71:53 - in how should i answer this
71:57 - so
72:01 - i was never a huge fan of computer
72:03 - vision because in my mind
72:05 - there are some problems that
72:09 - a certain classification problems that
72:12 - computers are
72:13 - better at solving computers are much
72:16 - better at solving problems
72:17 - versus humans when there is one right
72:20 - answer when
72:21 - they need to calculate a spreadsheet for
72:23 - example
72:24 - uh computers are just gonna be way
72:27 - better than humans hands down no matter
72:29 - what
72:30 - however if you ask a baby
72:33 - or not a baby if you ask a toddler to
72:36 - draw a picture of a horse and then
72:37 - ask a programmer to write a program to
72:39 - draw a picture of a horse
72:41 - then it's a little bit different
72:44 - and the reason it's different or
72:47 - difficult for computers is because there
72:49 - is no
72:50 - one right answer of what is a horse
72:54 - someone could draw a pitcher with just a
72:56 - head someone could draw a picture of a
72:57 - horse jumping over someone could draw a
72:58 - black
72:59 - horse a brown horse and when you get
73:01 - into these classification of problems
73:03 - where
73:04 - there is not one right answer it becomes
73:07 - a difficult area for
73:08 - computers so that's why i like computer
73:12 - vision and image recognition
73:15 - i s like i see the benefit of it like
73:17 - you have photos of people and you want
73:19 - to be able to recognize them
73:20 - but that's why i was um not so drawn
73:24 - towards that
73:24 - because i i view technology as a way to
73:27 - extend the capability of humans
73:29 - we can't calculate these spreadsheets or
73:30 - total as fast as
73:32 - a computer can so let's use computing as
73:35 - a tool
73:36 - to allow this to reach that limit
73:38 - however when it comes to understanding
73:41 - more abstract concepts like um
73:44 - identifying is this picture um a good
73:47 - painting of a horse
73:49 - then some decisions i feel
73:53 - are better left in the hands of humans
73:56 - [Music]
73:57 - blockchain series 2021 so caleb curry is
74:00 - actually working on a blockchain
74:02 - tutorial for
74:04 - or a tutorial series for this have you
74:06 - ever heard of fast api
74:08 - uh yes so i am uh definitely taking
74:12 - i i never use it in a production
74:14 - environment but i
74:17 - these other questions all right so i
74:18 - never use fast api in that production
74:20 - environment but i looked into it
74:22 - recently i
74:23 - it looks very cool i want to take a
74:25 - deeper dive
74:27 - and that's something i may also
74:30 - put on the schedule
74:35 - favorite channel thank you very much
74:39 - videos help you a lot thank you very
74:41 - much as well
74:43 - and okay
74:50 - how do you think about using frameworks
74:52 - verse micro
74:54 - services so um
74:59 - we use microservices essentially
75:02 - so we use frameworks whenever we want to
75:04 - build a more complex
75:05 - application just because it gives you a
75:07 - nice pattern to use
75:08 - industry standards and also developers
75:11 - are just familiar with different types
75:13 - of frameworks
75:14 - microservices we typically use for
75:17 - processes that
75:20 - they aren't really uh that time
75:23 - sensitive or they're just longer running
75:25 - processes that kind of can be separated
75:27 - from your main application
75:29 - one example would be like um optimizing
75:32 - images
75:32 - whenever you upload images for a product
75:35 - or for
75:35 - profile so on and so forth you want that
75:38 - large image because you know
75:39 - people ever want to zoom in or whatever
75:42 - but you typically want a smaller
75:43 - thumbnail
75:45 - as well just because whenever you're
75:47 - loading a list of products for example
75:49 - you don't need that huge image just
75:51 - because it takes so much bandwidth
75:53 - so a microprocessor might be good in
75:55 - that
75:56 - where it's not really time sensitive you
75:58 - know maybe it slows it down a bit
76:00 - but um yeah
76:03 - just uh different use cases i suppose
76:06 - [Music]
76:09 - all right python in the future from ryan
76:13 - so this is uh interesting i don't know
76:17 - if you were here earlier on but i asked
76:19 - on the twitter poll
76:20 - what do you want to learn in 2021 and
76:22 - surprisingly people
76:24 - voted python is number one and
76:27 - surprising because
76:29 - i thought that they would be sick of
76:30 - learning python on my channel
76:32 - by now but um yeah apparently not
76:36 - why is c still popular so c is very
76:39 - performant
76:41 - which i assume is the reason it's so
76:43 - popular
76:44 - and also it's in a lot of uh different
76:46 - things today
76:48 - people you see in electronics low-level
76:50 - things
76:51 - but mostly performance reasons
76:55 - c is really the foundation for a lot of
76:57 - different programming languages
77:00 - bucky how to make a web page update by
77:03 - itself whenever there's a change in
77:05 - database so whenever you have a change
77:08 - in your uh data architecture
77:10 - you typically run something well i guess
77:13 - uh what i'm familiar with in my tech
77:15 - stack there's something called a
77:17 - migration where you essentially update
77:20 - your database and then uh after
77:24 - and then in parallel you update your
77:25 - servers and then
77:27 - after you update your front end but it's
77:29 - actually
77:30 - uh it's a well-known
77:34 - um challenge because what you're
77:36 - essentially trying to do whenever you
77:38 - want to update your database
77:39 - architecture
77:40 - is you don't want any downtime at all
77:43 - however in an alternative situation what
77:47 - you can do is you can take a snapshot or
77:48 - clone of your database
77:50 - and then you can change the structure of
77:52 - it and then you can essentially
77:55 - deploy your new network your back end
77:57 - and then your front end
77:59 - on this uh like temporary ghost network
78:01 - and then once
78:02 - your updates are all good to go then you
78:04 - could route your traffic over from your
78:06 - old network to your new network
78:08 - now the main challenge with that is that
78:11 - even though you can essentially take a
78:13 - snapshot of your entire architecture
78:15 - update everything while the users are
78:16 - still using your old one
78:18 - and then get everything ready and then
78:20 - switch
78:21 - the traffic over you still have an issue
78:24 - where at the time
78:25 - you took that snapshot and are rolling
78:28 - everything over
78:29 - then you essentially have people still
78:31 - updating data here
78:32 - you still have people like sending
78:34 - messages or adding products or whatever
78:36 - it is
78:37 - now in that time is uh
78:40 - these two databases can get out of sync
78:42 - so they have something
78:43 - for i always forget the color it's like
78:45 - red green or
78:46 - blue green deployment what's the name of
78:49 - it i feel silly even
78:54 - yeah i think it is blue green yeah blue
78:56 - green deployment
78:57 - where it's just different models of how
79:00 - you
79:01 - essentially solve that exact problem
79:04 - okay wow mr wow these are lots of
79:08 - messages coming on okay
79:11 - let's see put them in the future
79:18 - colin or flutter i am not falling for
79:21 - that trap that is uh
79:22 - gonna start a war in this
79:28 - make python add-on and blender
79:31 - so i probably will not be teaching
79:34 - anymore blender
79:35 - for a while unfortunately where you make
79:38 - other algorithms and data structures
79:40 - tutorials so
79:41 - someone requested this as well and i
79:43 - want to get your guys input
79:45 - so some people say uh they would like me
79:48 - to make algorithm and data structures
79:50 - tutorials
79:51 - other people say that there are already
79:53 - lots of youtube videos and content
79:55 - out there for it so they would prefer me
79:58 - to make something else but yeah uh since
80:02 - i got lots of people here right now what
80:03 - do you guys think
80:06 - any plans to do machine learning courses
80:10 - so nothing on the immediate agenda
80:12 - however 2021
80:14 - uh we're still figuring out exactly what
80:16 - type of content
80:17 - to produce and that appears to be a
80:21 - pretty big one
80:22 - so yeah i can see it slowly moving up
80:25 - on the on the schedule
80:30 - how do you have like what's this number
80:35 - how do you have 1 million 468 437
80:38 - different tutorial playlists
80:40 - did you teach yourself all that stuff uh
80:44 - i don't think i have quite that many but
80:46 - um yes
80:47 - i did teach myself that it's actually
80:50 - pretty enjoyable i like
80:52 - i like learning new things it's not it's
80:54 - not like uh
80:55 - learning something in school where you
80:57 - have to learn it it was uh
80:59 - i don't know it's enjoyable and that's
81:02 - another thing i'm
81:03 - very uh fortunate i can
81:06 - do what i enjoy in life i know not many
81:09 - people
81:10 - have that opportunity or they get stuck
81:12 - into a career or path in life that
81:15 - they're not really interested in or not
81:17 - really passionate about
81:18 - and i'm very fortunate for that
81:20 - opportunity
81:24 - all right mongodb that's another going
81:26 - on
81:27 - man a lot of stuff i want to teach
81:32 - privacy encryption as your proof
81:33 - knowledge tutorials would be
81:35 - cool kyle am i liking these ideas
81:41 - uh how to learn things fast
81:49 - i don't know uh to be honest i don't
81:51 - learn
81:52 - things faster than
81:56 - uh other people uh i i might even learn
81:59 - things slower
82:00 - i am just really obsessed with um
82:04 - learning things pretty uh deep
82:07 - and if there's one part of it i don't
82:09 - understand i'll just go deeper and
82:10 - deeper
82:11 - until i understand it but i would say
82:15 - like um if there were a bunch of people
82:17 - in a room
82:18 - and you gave us something brand new to
82:20 - learn
82:21 - and then you said okay in an hour or
82:24 - however long you think it takes to learn
82:26 - then do this test after
82:28 - i would probably be uh slower than the
82:32 - average person
82:33 - just that in that example um even though
82:35 - i might have been slower i would want to
82:37 - take the
82:38 - the content home with me and then just
82:40 - pour over it
82:41 - even when the test was over just to
82:44 - understand it and maybe that's not a
82:46 - good example because
82:48 - in that case i would just be learning
82:49 - something just for the sake of
82:50 - completing a test
82:52 - but when it comes to computing different
82:54 - technologies
82:56 - and seeing how these different
82:58 - technologies can be used to connect
83:00 - people
83:00 - and build awesome things then it's uh
83:04 - yeah it's not really learning it's just
83:06 - something i'm passionate about
83:08 - i want to figure out how things work all
83:11 - right web assembly
83:12 - okay yes weebas slow learner but the
83:16 - that's uh very short and
83:20 - yeah i feel the same way distributed
83:23 - computing
83:24 - i like that idea as well
83:28 - i actually have a let me see if it's
83:32 - here
83:35 - i'll show you guys a cool book
83:40 - so with distributed computing i would
83:42 - recommend this i actually think i took a
83:45 - it's another thing i posted a video on
83:48 - instagram
83:49 - and or not a video i posted a picture on
83:51 - instagram where i
83:52 - i put a post-it note and then a slice of
83:55 - cheese
83:56 - on this book and i said art and i don't
83:58 - even think people realized that it was
83:59 - cheese
84:00 - i think they just thought it was post-it
84:01 - notes so you know
84:03 - i was a little disappointed about that
84:05 - that no one saw my beautiful artwork
84:07 - but uh yeah point of the story
84:10 - is that this is a very good book for uh
84:13 - distributed systems
84:16 - all right bucky loves bacon definitely
84:18 - agree with that
84:19 - data science related technologies
84:25 - yeah it's a pretty big feel build your
84:29 - own cryptocurrency
84:30 - tutorials cyberpunk well you are in luck
84:33 - because we have a huge open source
84:35 - project gone
84:36 - to build a very innovative
84:39 - cryptocurrency
84:40 - that is going to belong to the new
84:42 - boston
84:43 - so i actually have a series
84:46 - uh digital currency tutorials that we're
84:49 - walking through
84:49 - everything and then also check out the
84:51 - github the new boston developers
84:53 - lots of different repos lots of activity
84:55 - on that as well
84:59 - do you have actual advice to self
85:01 - teaching programmers
85:03 - besides the whole stick with the routine
85:07 - so i would say that for self-teaching
85:11 - programmers that
85:12 - it's not a good idea to say i want to
85:15 - learn programming so i'm going to type
85:16 - in programming on amazon and then i'm
85:18 - just going to start reading through a
85:20 - book
85:20 - because with that there is no direction
85:24 - there is nothing to
85:27 - give what you're doing meaning and
85:31 - when you don't know where you're going
85:33 - you don't know where to go
85:35 - it's uh okay i got through this chapter
85:37 - should i go next chapter should i
85:38 - learn this other book so on and so forth
85:41 - now when it comes to
85:42 - um a more clear vision say i want to be
85:45 - a web developer
85:46 - well then things get a little bit easier
85:48 - then you can say okay
85:49 - this company that i want to look for or
85:51 - work for they use
85:52 - django and they use react so i
85:55 - am going to um learn django not
85:58 - for the sake of learning django and
86:00 - hoping that something good happens but
86:02 - i'm gonna learn it because there's a
86:04 - goal at the end and then i'm gonna learn
86:06 - react
86:06 - for this and learning in that sense
86:10 - it becomes more than just learning for
86:12 - the sake of learning
86:14 - you don't get bogged down by oh i have
86:16 - to read documentation or i have to get
86:17 - through this chapter
86:19 - the site in your vision is always on
86:22 - that final goal
86:23 - that final goal which is a lot more
86:26 - satisfying
86:27 - and it's a lot more clear when people
86:29 - learn that way
86:31 - [Music]
86:32 - okay lots of uh lots of the same
86:35 - comments
86:36 - kind of spamming oh
86:39 - okay let me go back up back up here hi
86:42 - bucky is a degree in cs
86:44 - worth it um
86:54 - is it worth it hmm
86:58 - it's different for everyone uh
87:01 - for myself it wasn't however
87:07 - for you it may be it's uh it depends on
87:12 - so it doesn't hurt i will say that uh
87:15 - it's not gonna hurt your chances
87:16 - applying somewhere if you say i got like
87:19 - a masters in this
87:20 - area of computing versus if you don't
87:23 - now i will say that
87:25 - some people learn better
87:29 - not in university some people need that
87:31 - pressure of your teacher
87:33 - or someone says look you need to
87:34 - complete this assignment uh
87:37 - you need to create this test you need to
87:39 - finish this degree so on and so forth
87:41 - but some people are just better
87:42 - independent learning some people are
87:43 - better reading books
87:45 - some people learn better watching
87:47 - tutorials so
87:48 - it's different for each person and
87:50 - depending on where you want to go
87:52 - in the path that you need to go to get
87:54 - there
87:55 - um i would say it's i know it's not the
87:58 - answer that a lot of people
88:00 - like to hear but without understanding
88:01 - your background your different
88:03 - methods where you learn best it's uh
88:05 - it's difficult to say
88:08 - all right please make tutorials on
88:10 - ethereum and blockchain
88:12 - okay you got it
88:16 - yes two of my uh newly favorite subject
88:20 - your mic looks like a toothbrush
88:24 - okay no uh no response nina i concur
88:28 - uh helping me all these years you are
88:31 - welcome for that
88:32 - could hurt you financial kyle
88:36 - another good point so yes a degree
88:40 - um
88:42 - that is a thing where a degree at least
88:45 - in the united states
88:47 - it costs a lot of money education costs
88:49 - a lot of money
88:51 - and another i hate saying like downsides
88:55 - to this but
88:56 - um when you go to a university and
88:59 - expect to get a degree
89:00 - after four years what that means is that
89:04 - alternatively if you were to go to a
89:06 - boot camp or self-learn
89:08 - in maybe not have as much knowledge but
89:11 - you would
89:11 - begin uh entering the workforce earlier
89:15 - then you would essentially trade those
89:17 - four years for like three years worth of
89:19 - experience
89:20 - so uh and i will say from
89:24 - uh just everyone that we have hired in
89:26 - the past experienced
89:29 - i would almost always take someone with
89:31 - a one-year boot camp and three years of
89:33 - developer experience versus four years
89:36 - of university but i don't know
89:38 - again that depends on the type of
89:40 - company
89:42 - okay wow every time i scroll down i feel
89:44 - like i miss all these
89:46 - uh
89:51 - any plans to collab
89:54 - yeah a couple of different collabs in
89:56 - the works
90:00 - thank you a lot of uh very
90:04 - okay uh lots of um
90:07 - people saying thank you for helping out
90:09 - which i appreciate very much and then
90:12 - another slew of comments about how my
90:15 - microphone looks like a toothbrush
90:16 - which it's interesting uh
90:20 - go to canada not a bad idea i don't know
90:22 - if they would like us americans at this
90:24 - point in time
90:25 - but
90:29 - design patterns and the way you explain
90:30 - it would be awesome yeah
90:33 - i like that as well i also like talking
90:35 - about that stuff um
90:37 - it's a little more interesting than uh
90:40 - teaching programming
90:41 - to show how the different parts of
90:44 - language connect and more of a system
90:45 - level
90:46 - another note i want to show you guys let
90:48 - me see
90:48 - [Music]
90:52 - it wasn't it was actually a book it's
90:54 - called something
90:55 - maybe one of you guys knows it like um
90:57 - thinking in systems
90:58 - or something but it's not strictly a
91:02 - programming uh book but it's more of a
91:05 - book on
91:06 - like uh systems overall of how things
91:09 - connected how information flows from one
91:11 - part to another
91:12 - and it's useful for like uh building any
91:14 - type of system whether you're making a
91:16 - complex
91:17 - application uh an organization and you
91:20 - just have to
91:20 - have a different teams how does
91:22 - information flow between them
91:24 - it's just um i don't know i'm just
91:26 - really interested in
91:28 - system development for whatever reason
91:31 - api tutorials please
91:32 - another very good recommendation
91:38 - and oh
91:41 - need more mods for chat can i have mods
91:43 - in here
91:44 - oh manage moderators very cool
91:50 - okay how does this work and who's going
91:52 - to be a moderator
91:59 - uh let's see competition thinking
92:05 - protocol buffer grpc any plans yes this
92:08 - seems to be an
92:09 - ever growing area and especially with uh
92:12 - cryptocurrency blockchain
92:15 - yeah i do like that idea as well
92:21 - oh react.js
92:26 - slow mode please for chats is that the
92:28 - thing are you just making that up
92:30 - slow mode for chats
92:34 - i honestly don't know if uh that's a
92:37 - thing or not or if you just made it up
92:38 - but uh
92:39 - yes that that would be useful
92:44 - okay what do we got here
92:51 - uh does it annoy you that technology and
92:53 - programming languages
92:54 - change so fast uh no i actually um
92:58 - i love it so even though it does seem
93:01 - like um
93:03 - especially with like javascript front
93:04 - end pro well you know what
93:06 - a lot of different areas now that i
93:08 - think about it like devops
93:10 - front-end development uh mobile
93:12 - development
93:13 - but i do like it because it isn't
93:16 - changing for the sake
93:17 - sake of changing it's changing for
93:20 - the better it's changing because we have
93:22 - better technologies or we can
93:24 - uh create things faster
93:27 - [Music]
93:30 - okay no slow mode
93:34 - hey guys bucky here random guy
93:38 - what a great username uh
93:41 - all right what the heck is going on
93:43 - bucky
93:44 - wait i'm here in no slow mode and then
93:47 - i'm here bucky there is a slow mop
93:49 - it's very confusing how to become a
93:52 - billionaire i would say
93:54 - uh investing in cryptocurrency
94:00 - do you see front end being automated
94:02 - soon uh
94:04 - front you mean front end how do you mean
94:07 - that
94:12 - continue with cli noted uh tutorials on
94:16 - github
94:16 - okay nice shirt bucky yes this is my uh
94:19 - stretched out
94:25 - stretch out what day is it saturday
94:27 - shirt
94:30 - what is the purpose of life i would say
94:33 - that
94:34 - the purpose of life is to collect
94:37 - memories with the people you love
94:39 - because those are the best memories that
94:41 - you can collect
94:48 - bro you're awesome happy to see you
94:50 - happy to see you too
94:53 - uh let's see what is cryptocurrency so
94:56 - cryptocurrency
94:57 - is a currency that exists only in
95:00 - digital form
95:03 - what is my favorite crypto well of
95:05 - course i'm a little biased because we
95:07 - are making our own crypto
95:09 - and of course it has to be the new
95:11 - boston coins uh my second
95:14 - so i wouldn't say i have a a favorite
95:16 - favorite i like um
95:19 - i like bitcoin for what it did for
95:21 - cryptocurrency overall
95:23 - and kind of uh
95:26 - everything that it stands for i like
95:28 - ethereum for its flexibility
95:30 - and how it pushed uh things even further
95:33 - i like monero
95:34 - because of the focus on privacy and
95:38 - yeah a lot of different cryptocurrencies
95:40 - i like and invest in for different
95:42 - reasons
95:45 - buckies uh do i still have that sensory
95:47 - deprivation thing unfortunately
95:49 - not i moved from my house in new york
95:52 - to pasadena california now and
95:56 - i did love that if i ever have a house
95:58 - again i'm definitely getting another one
96:00 - it was a lot of work to maintain i will
96:03 - say
96:04 - a lot more than like a pool or a hot tub
96:06 - and uh
96:07 - the thing i didn't like about it is if
96:10 - you ever want in on vacation or anything
96:12 - because there was so much salt in the
96:13 - water because uh it didn't keep you
96:15 - buoyant
96:16 - that it would like clog up the pipes so
96:18 - you needed to keep it running
96:20 - needed to keep it filtering and you just
96:22 - can't it felt a little bit scary to uh
96:25 - like put on an automated timer or
96:27 - anything because
96:30 - they aren't like the most stable systems
96:32 - and uh
96:33 - it would leak sometimes so you know i
96:35 - was afraid to
96:36 - leave it pumping when i wasn't there
96:38 - because i didn't want everything like
96:40 - blowing up all over all over my living
96:42 - room
96:46 - tron uh not
96:49 - a fan of tron is a cryptocurrency
96:55 - yes spam lots of spam going on
97:04 - all right hold on guys trying to sort
97:06 - through these but i got some spam
97:08 - comment
97:09 - can i buy the new boston somewhere so
97:11 - not right now
97:12 - uh we have plans on the roadmap and
97:15 - maybe i can show you guys this
97:18 - should let me talk to you guys through
97:19 - real quick
97:21 - i know some people are here interested
97:22 - in the uh digital currency that we're
97:24 - making and some people aren't so
97:26 - try to answer it quickly so on our
97:29 - roadmap we're having
97:30 - an authentication system built into the
97:32 - website and then we're gonna have user
97:34 - profiles and more social
97:36 - and then we're gonna have a marketplace
97:38 - where they're gonna be t-shirts
97:40 - and uh stickers and like hats and stuff
97:43 - for sale
97:44 - then after that we're gonna allow other
97:46 - people to add items to the marketplace
97:48 - like uh
97:49 - books maybe this elephant and uh those
97:51 - things behind
97:52 - just like uh books artwork uh bracelets
97:55 - whatever people want to sell kind of
97:57 - like ebay craigslist style
97:59 - and then we're gonna add the actual
98:01 - payment integration system in so you can
98:03 - add an item to your cart scan it with
98:05 - your phone or whatever app
98:07 - and then uh like let's say it's a
98:09 - t-shirt you can type in whatever
98:11 - information have it mailed to you
98:13 - and then after that we're going to be
98:14 - reaching out to other websites
98:16 - uh actually a couple already reached out
98:18 - that are interested in
98:20 - accepting coins and the first websites
98:23 - that we're going to hit
98:24 - is essentially uh ones that sell digital
98:27 - goods or
98:27 - downloadable goods like online courses
98:30 - or if they have graphics music whatever
98:33 - just because it's such a low-cost good
98:35 - to deliver and then they get coins
98:37 - and also in addition for coins they also
98:40 - get a community of developers
98:42 - and free marketing for their site and
98:45 - our community benefits because we now
98:47 - have something else that we can spend
98:49 - our coins with
98:50 - so that's going to happen slowly over
98:52 - time and also
98:54 - once our marketplace on the new
98:55 - boston.com is complete
98:57 - we are going to be uh not only reaching
98:59 - out to other websites but
99:00 - looking to get on an exchange as well so
99:03 - very exciting times ahead
99:07 - all right what is bitcoin bitcoin
99:10 - is the og cryptocurrency actually wasn't
99:13 - the first but it was the first
99:17 - i don't want to say successful since
99:19 - that means the other ones aren't
99:20 - successful but
99:22 - uh yeah one of the main
99:29 - i'm getting contracted here all right
99:33 - uh how can i okay to answer that
99:35 - question bitcoin is a cryptocurrency
99:38 - how can i buy ethereum without coinbase
99:40 - so there
99:41 - are so there used to be these um
99:45 - these sites you went to kind of like uh
99:47 - craigslist but
99:48 - you had to like meet someone a person
99:49 - and pay them cash i don't know if they
99:51 - still have those
99:52 - but um yeah there are lots of different
99:54 - exchanges aside from coinbase
99:57 - where uh you can buy ethereum and other
100:00 - cryptocurrencies for
100:02 - um well i don't want to say us dollar i
100:05 - don't know
100:05 - where you are but uh other currencies as
100:08 - well
100:11 - bitcoin is good but will not move
100:14 - anymore as a store of value
100:18 - because it's too slow
100:21 - yep uh i can so i i do think
100:24 - bitcoin does have lots of room to grow
100:27 - but
100:28 - it will most likely be a longer term
100:30 - store value more like a gold
100:32 - is right now rather than uh kind of like
100:36 - i don't feel it's going to be used in
100:38 - day-to-day transactions
100:47 - all right all right
100:50 - stop spamming guys yes
100:53 - all right
100:57 - uh let's see
101:01 - okay lots of uh a little bit of spam
101:03 - here that's all right
101:05 - okay bucky do you have any plans of
101:07 - starting on index fun
101:09 - or etf i do
101:13 - not unfortunately
101:18 - i'm in the valley near pasadena foo
101:21 - welcome to the h hole of ello
101:24 - oh yeah la's getting pretty rough right
101:26 - now i'm actually off
101:28 - i'm in uh pasadena near la and flying
101:31 - back to see my family in new york
101:33 - and pretty much going from like lax to
101:35 - new york airports and they're like the
101:37 - worst
101:38 - places in the country right now in the
101:39 - world in america
101:41 - which isn't doing too hot either and
101:44 - it's like
101:45 - it in america's spiking like crazier
101:48 - right now
101:48 - it's my great this it's not feeling like
101:51 - the best idea but
101:53 - i haven't seen my family in a very long
101:55 - time
101:59 - oh do you like tie dye
102:04 - i'm indifferent to die die all right
102:09 - uh how can cash be replaced with
102:11 - cryptocurrency
102:13 - uh yeah it's essentially uh
102:17 - when those shops when those stores
102:21 - start deciding to accept cryptocurrency
102:24 - and from technical point of view i don't
102:27 - think it will be anything that foreign
102:28 - to people
102:29 - because they really use cryptocurrency
102:32 - in a way
102:32 - uh even though like cash isn't used
102:36 - for the majority of transactions a lot
102:39 - of it is just
102:39 - digital credit card uh it's just numbers
102:41 - on a computer or
102:43 - on your bank account so really not that
102:46 - far off it's just the underlying method
102:49 - behind it i think will become
102:51 - quite different in a good way all right
102:54 - will the vlogs be back that
102:56 - is hmm that's a good question i was
102:58 - thinking about
102:59 - booting up that channel again but uh to
103:01 - be honest nothing really
103:03 - a vlog worthy to vlog about now uh just
103:06 - because
103:07 - vlogs would pretty much just be me
103:09 - sitting in my apartment
103:11 - and either working on digital currency
103:14 - network or making videos
103:16 - um probably just not the most
103:19 - interesting stuff since
103:20 - i can't really go outside now that we're
103:23 - on lockdown
103:24 - there's a question i just saw that was
103:26 - pretty interesting but i forgot what it
103:27 - was
103:33 - man these comments are coming fast okay
103:36 - okay
103:41 - oh do i believe in aliens okay
103:44 - now we're getting to the important
103:45 - questions do i believe in aliens
103:51 - hmm i'm gonna ask this for a delay since
103:55 - i know that you guys will be interested
103:57 - as well do you believe in aliens
103:59 - but now let's think about this so
104:06 - i i guess the uh the interesting thing
104:09 - about this
104:10 - is we're not exactly sure how life began
104:14 - we have
104:15 - uh different theories of course
104:18 - uh but we have different theories about
104:20 - everything
104:21 - so we do
104:26 - we do know that it's a very unique thing
104:29 - we do know that it's possible
104:32 - also i don't want to get into any uh
104:34 - religious debates
104:36 - either but um
104:45 - i see it it's a very um
104:49 - unique thing in a unique you need a very
104:51 - unique set of circumstances
104:54 - and a lot of it i'm sure happens by
104:57 - chance but
104:58 - i don't see anything scientifically that
105:02 - limits
105:03 - the fact that life can only be created
105:06 - on earth so with that i
105:09 - unfortunately i don't have any
105:12 - experience
105:12 - seeing an alien for myself um
105:16 - no direct evidence of that but i'm
105:18 - open-minded
105:19 - [Music]
105:24 - that was a good question by the way your
105:25 - heart getting into the good stuff now
105:28 - all right bucky on the plane don't use
105:31 - the bathroom
105:34 - okay i won't
105:41 - uh how am i funding this project so
105:44 - yes so there are funds being spent right
105:47 - now
105:48 - a couple contractors helping out with
105:49 - more specialized areas
105:51 - as well as hosting uh for the new boston
105:55 - uh so on and so forth and we need like
105:57 - to purchase
105:58 - um like wordpress themes and wordpress
106:01 - hosting
106:02 - and uh for the blog and just some like
106:05 - miscellaneous stuff right now i'm just
106:07 - funding it out of my
106:08 - uh personal funds
106:15 - flutter series coming in 2021
106:19 - is your mic toothbrush yes
106:23 - when did you start working on
106:24 - cryptocurrency and why
106:27 - started working on it uh
106:30 - at the beginning of this year because um
106:33 - i saw some optimizations for the bitcoin
106:36 - blockchain
106:36 - i saw it as a big barrier to adoption
106:39 - and
106:40 - i i wanted to solve
106:43 - the problems that no one else could
106:48 - and i knew that uh
106:51 - yeah if this thing got off the ground
106:53 - then the network
106:55 - that i had through the new boston and
106:56 - through this community
106:58 - that we would be able to make a very big
107:01 - positive impact on the world if things
107:04 - went well
107:05 - which they seem to be going very good
107:06 - right now
107:09 - all right duh okay
107:13 - i like eagles hearts question if you
107:15 - could fly or become invisible
107:17 - which one would you choose
107:22 - if i could fly i mean these are tough
107:26 - both would be great i mean
107:30 - you just can't pass up going invisible i
107:31 - mean animals fly
107:33 - birds fly planes fly but nothing could
107:35 - be invisible so
107:37 - that would be uh you know how can i pass
107:39 - that up
107:42 - okay let's see which is more button
107:46 - field when comparing cloud computing
107:48 - blockchain and
107:48 - big data whoo that is tough
107:52 - so i would rule out big data just
107:55 - because
107:56 - it was budding a while ago i see uh
108:00 - oh blockchain was budding a while ago
108:03 - too but blockchain
108:04 - has had a it's like a second life all of
108:06 - a sudden
108:08 - almost since the um yeah whenever this
108:11 - uh
108:12 - the virus hit in the lockdown began a
108:14 - lot of these things uh crash
108:16 - like or dipped uh cryptocurrency but
108:19 - then they came back
108:20 - very strong and a second bit of interest
108:23 - cloud computing
108:24 - uh i wouldn't even say that's budding i
108:26 - would say that is already butted
108:28 - and we are already in the bud does that
108:31 - make sense in the bud
108:32 - hey we're wrong with it all right uh
108:35 - story behind the new boston this is a
108:39 - pretty bad story where i just thought it
108:41 - sounded cool
108:42 - i didn't know whenever i created the
108:44 - youtube channel
108:45 - the new boston that it would turn into
108:47 - what it turned into
108:48 - if i didn't know that then i definitely
108:50 - would have pop a lot more thought into
108:52 - it
108:53 - but whenever i was just signed up for
108:55 - youtube i'm like what name sounds cool
108:58 - the new boston that sounds pretty cool
109:00 - so
109:02 - sorry to disappoint you on that
109:06 - build a tutorial on how consciousness
109:08 - works
109:09 - so cyberpunk this is a very
109:13 - this is uh interesting that you brought
109:15 - this up because
109:16 - i thought about this specific question
109:18 - for longer than
109:20 - uh i feel like a lot of other people
109:24 - have because
109:26 - i was wondering first to be able to
109:30 - define consciousness
109:31 - and then to be able to translate it into
109:34 - a computer you you get into a lot of um
109:39 - interesting questions like what is
109:41 - consciousness what is
109:42 - life what does it mean what is thinking
109:46 - um and i always go back to
109:50 - kind of uh babies when they're entering
109:53 - life for the first time
109:54 - oh they come out into a universe
109:59 - and they don't they're not familiar with
110:01 - anything they've never seen slights
110:02 - before
110:04 - never smelled never hurt sound and
110:07 - everything's new and they know how to do
110:09 - certain things
110:10 - uh they don't know how to do certain
110:12 - things and they learn a lot of things
110:14 - as well so part of it is
110:18 - what they are and what they are
110:20 - naturally inclined to do and the other
110:21 - part is their environment
110:23 - it's the universe around them in a way
110:26 - it's like um
110:28 - your combination of everything that's
110:30 - around you everything that you've ever
110:31 - ate everything that influenced you so on
110:33 - and so forth
110:34 - but consciousness is a very interesting
110:38 - subject and as far as computing goes
110:42 - which i'm sure
110:43 - a lot of you would be interested in is
110:47 - is it possible for a computer to have
110:50 - consciousness
110:50 - if not why not what makes humans so
110:54 - special
110:54 - that computers will never be able to do
110:57 - because
110:58 - if human consciousness can be broken
111:00 - down to
111:01 - um our brain which is just broken down
111:03 - to biology which can be broken on
111:06 - to chemistry which can be broken down in
111:08 - physics which can be broken down to math
111:10 - then if everything can be broken down to
111:12 - mathematics even consciousness then
111:14 - there's no reason why a computer can't
111:17 - be consciousness
111:18 - can't be conscious because we can
111:20 - program formulas into it
111:21 - maybe a little bit slower with the
111:23 - limitations of technology
111:25 - but
111:28 - to say that would say that you are uh
111:32 - you need a formula for a consciousness a
111:34 - mathematical formula
111:36 - and whether consciousness can be broken
111:39 - down to a formula
111:40 - is something we have yet to find out
111:45 - how do we become master programmers by
111:46 - what means it is only through tutorials
111:49 - of reading books
111:52 - how do we become that programmer that
111:53 - can program a lot of
111:55 - things probably not the answer you're
111:58 - looking for but um
112:00 - practice i would make little projects
112:03 - in one second getting thirsty
112:10 - how do we become master programmers so
112:12 - even that definition is uh
112:14 - it changes like uh got like a helicopter
112:18 - out
112:18 - outside my window so a master is
112:23 - masters in uh different people's eyes
112:25 - but i'll just say lots of practice
112:27 - uh build projects that you're interested
112:30 - in and you're passionate about
112:32 - and eventually you'll get there
112:35 - i like to know more about cryptocurrency
112:37 - and learn
112:39 - to earn
112:43 - okay lots of cryptocurrency on
112:47 - the channel 2021 and also if you want to
112:50 - learn more about cryptocurrency i highly
112:51 - recommend
112:52 - that you join our github since we are
112:55 - working as a community the new boston on
112:58 - which will be
112:59 - the greatest cryptocurrency of all time
113:02 - in my opinion
113:04 - all right let's see this thing outside
113:06 - can you hear that
113:07 - it's like a helicopter or something
113:09 - really annoying me
113:21 - can you be my spirit guide slash
113:22 - accountant
113:24 - hmm hmm
113:30 - yes
113:34 - holy there's a lot of spam okay uh
113:40 - do you know tequila timmy youtube
113:42 - channel i do not
113:46 - do you need a phd not sure
113:50 - with what
113:53 - when do you think we will reach
113:54 - singularity and what our economy will
113:56 - look like
113:57 - after singularity so this is also an
114:01 - interesting thing
114:01 - man uh eagleheart and cyberpunk are just
114:05 - killing it with the questions
114:09 - so that it depends on how you define
114:11 - singularity but
114:13 - what i do see i kind of mentioned this
114:16 - earlier
114:16 - is that we
114:19 - as human beings are
114:23 - we have a drive to build and innovate
114:25 - and create
114:26 - and it appears that things
114:29 - are that we're building something that
114:32 - we don't understand
114:34 - and we're building something big and
114:36 - what we're building
114:38 - even though we may not be able to
114:40 - explain in words what it is
114:41 - what's happening with technology is it's
114:43 - becoming more connected
114:45 - and it's connecting lots of people
114:48 - around the world and it's happening very
114:49 - quickly
114:50 - and innovation is accelerating what the
114:54 - end of this
114:54 - is all i do not know
114:58 - but it's a very
115:01 - interesting path that we are headed down
115:04 - especially with the uh re-emergence of
115:08 - ai
115:09 - and lots of different trends as well
115:13 - so when do i think we reach singularity
115:16 - i am not sure
115:17 - and what will our economy look like
115:20 - after singularity
115:23 - i'm not sure either but very different
115:25 - than what it looks like now
115:26 - singularity or not oh
115:30 - okay let's go back back okay uh coin
115:33 - am i making a coin or a token on the
115:35 - blockchain we're making a coin
115:37 - and then i'm getting old to ask this but
115:41 - how can i stop
115:42 - playing games and start coding instead
115:46 - so for this
115:49 - i would say that
115:54 - [Music]
115:57 - naturally people would do what they are
115:59 - most passionate about
116:01 - if you enjoy playing games versus uh
116:04 - more than you enjoy building things
116:06 - creating things creating software
116:08 - then it's probably not going to happen
116:10 - uh
116:12 - to start coding instead you need you
116:14 - need a reason or a purpose behind
116:16 - anything you do
116:17 - i like to build things because even when
116:20 - i was first starting out i like the idea
116:22 - that
116:22 - you could sit your computer and you can
116:25 - create something
116:27 - that can potentially connect people all
116:29 - around the world
116:31 - and even now i like it i like um just
116:34 - learning about new technologies
116:36 - new innovations i liked
116:39 - i like what you can do with
116:44 - knowledge and passion and then the
116:47 - community and the software that forms
116:49 - around it
116:50 - just something i'm very passionate about
116:52 - so
116:54 - how can i stop playing games and start
116:56 - coding instead
116:57 - if you're passionate about it then
116:59 - follow your heart
117:01 - favorite teacher or favorite programmer
117:03 - and
117:04 - favorite book so my favorite teacher um
117:07 - so aside from like my favorite teacher
117:09 - in school who was mr pulaski
117:12 - because in fifth grade we used to trade
117:14 - hockey cards
117:15 - and uh i think he also gave me like the
117:18 - good end of the trade he wasn't like
117:20 - ripping kids off so that was just fun
117:22 - but my favorite teacher online right now
117:24 - is uh stephen grider he teaches on udemy
117:27 - and he teaches i just love the way he
117:29 - teaches the way he communicates
117:31 - it's so uh in-depth and yeah
117:34 - so and what was the last one favorite
117:36 - book
117:38 - so my favorite programming book is a
117:40 - python cookbook just because it has lots
117:42 - of
117:43 - little neat tips and you don't have to
117:44 - like read it cover to cover you can kind
117:46 - of
117:46 - pick through it my favorite other book
117:49 - is uh
117:50 - oh the place is yogo by dr seuss
117:54 - um it's a lot of has some very
117:57 - it's like a book for kids but uh
118:01 - i don't know it just always resonated
118:03 - with me
118:05 - favorite teacher so that was the one
118:09 - hopping around okay what are your
118:12 - upcoming courses so
118:14 - i'm gonna finish the digital currency
118:15 - tutorials and then the account manager
118:17 - and then after that the main tutorials
118:20 - that you guys are looking for
118:22 - we are going to be rolling out with
118:23 - docker and aws
118:25 - and flutter and then after that
118:29 - we are essentially just going to go to
118:31 - the community and see what you guys want
118:32 - to see
118:35 - or listen to what you guys want to see
118:39 - what makes you motivated to do great
118:41 - things like the new boston
118:43 - everyday what keeps me motivated is
118:48 - the impact that it can have on the world
118:52 - so nothing i think um
118:55 - i think there's different types of
118:57 - incentive different types of motivation
118:59 - of course the main thing is uh financial
119:01 - motivation where
119:02 - i i have a job because i want income i
119:05 - want to live an apartment and i want to
119:06 - eat food
119:08 - um things i'm really passionate about
119:10 - where let's just pretend that everyone
119:12 - in the world got paid the same
119:13 - amount no matter what i would pretty
119:16 - much just be making uh
119:17 - youtube tutorials in teaching just
119:20 - because
119:20 - i love learning new things i like
119:23 - building things
119:24 - i like creating things that don't exist
119:28 - yet and solving problems that no one
119:30 - else has solved before
119:31 - and to be able to do it with the
119:32 - community that
119:34 - supports it and the bigger it gets the
119:37 - better it gets is just
119:39 - can't really ask for anything else
119:43 - favorite programming language in general
119:45 - i would say
119:46 - python it's hard to go uh go wrong with
119:49 - python
119:52 - and let's see
119:55 - developer dylan okay my cur
119:58 - career bucky thank you developer dylan
120:01 - glad i could help you out
120:09 - quadratic funding so this is another
120:12 - interesting concept so
120:16 - the thing about quadratic funding is
120:19 - that
120:20 - you are essentially attempting to
120:25 - it's a way that you are attempting to
120:27 - program the level of value
120:29 - and fairness into a uh
120:32 - cryptocurrency or digital economy
120:36 - the concept of value and fairness is
120:41 - i don't know if it's something that can
120:43 - be programmed into a formula
120:46 - i think it's uh an abstract concept and
120:48 - i think that
120:49 - the definition changes over time
120:53 - and it's different for each and every
120:54 - person so
120:56 - i think that quadratic funding is uh
120:58 - interesting because it solved a lot of
121:00 - the
121:01 - problems with uh fairness that a lot of
121:03 - people
121:04 - agree is you know unfair but
121:08 - i think that
121:12 - it's difficult to program these concepts
121:16 - of fairness
121:17 - of trust of value because
121:21 - even though we can see that these
121:22 - different algorithms exist
121:25 - uh it's almost hard to explain
121:28 - where and this is something else i'm
121:30 - noticing as well
121:31 - where people in a digital economy
121:35 - they have a lot of ideas of what is
121:37 - unfair
121:38 - or so on and so forth but then to go
121:41 - back and say
121:42 - well what is fair it's hard for them to
121:45 - answer
121:46 - because there is no one definition of
121:48 - what is fair what is trustworthy
121:50 - uh if they say where does the value come
121:53 - from and then to ask them
121:54 - how would you define value it becomes
121:57 - tricky it becomes difficult
121:59 - because there is no one answer so
122:03 - to take some of these ideas and
122:05 - programming into uh
122:06 - these different models or algorithms
122:09 - it's
122:12 - it's a different way of looking at it
122:14 - which is always good however
122:16 - i don't think it's the uh final solution
122:20 - probably shouldn't say that final
122:21 - solution i think that means something
122:22 - else
122:25 - is it possible to be anonymous on the
122:27 - internet it
122:28 - is possible to do a lot of things
122:32 - anonymously
122:34 - complete on anonymity
122:37 - is challenging
122:45 - try this background
122:50 - all right how long does it take to learn
122:53 - cryptocurrency
122:54 - you can learn the basics probably in a
122:56 - youtube video uh
122:57 - i don't know if anyone's ever gonna
123:00 - learn the
123:00 - complete uh everything there is to know
123:04 - about all cryptocurrencies since it's an
123:06 - ever growing field but um
123:10 - yeah basics in youtube video you can be
123:12 - pretty comfortable
123:13 - with it understanding the concepts in
123:15 - less than a week
123:16 - and then to dig down into any specific
123:20 - one
123:20 - you it takes a little bit longer
123:26 - okay let's see uh
123:31 - what is your say on go lane i like
123:33 - online actually
123:34 - um i had to port some of my applications
123:39 - over to going just because it is a lot
123:42 - more performant
123:43 - than python for example i think python
123:46 - is very good for
123:47 - um innovating and creating things
123:51 - quickly and even for a web application
123:52 - where you don't need to do a lot of
123:54 - heavy processing typically but um
123:59 - yeah just being able to
124:02 - buy i always want to make sure i don't
124:04 - miss any of these questions but i do
124:06 - like golang for
124:07 - a lot of different reasons pretty much
124:09 - all the ones that they promote on their
124:10 - website
124:16 - okay all program languages are a mess
124:18 - i'm working on my own
124:19 - i've had enough so much confusion and
124:21 - mess
124:23 - that's cool and a lot of the best
124:25 - program languages came from people who
124:27 - felt that same way
124:28 - where there isn't a good solution so
124:30 - they wanted to build
124:31 - a better one so yeah
124:35 - i'm a big fan of that as well what
124:37 - equipment do you use
124:38 - bucky uh so i use a pretty standard
124:42 - equipment this is a blue
124:44 - yeti mic i got a logic logistic webcam
124:48 - it's pretty simple
124:49 - i had to upgrade for my built-in one and
124:51 - then um
124:53 - yeah did you mean like a youtube
124:55 - appointment for recording
124:59 - cryptocurrencies are too unstable on
125:01 - price to use
125:02 - as a daily currency that is true it's a
125:06 - pretty uh volatile market right now
125:10 - probably not the best uh
125:14 - this early on to be like the global
125:16 - currency or anything
125:18 - but i feel like that'll stabilize over
125:20 - time as we've seen with bitcoin
125:22 - at the very beginning and then
125:25 - now it is more stable even though like
125:28 - uh
125:29 - jumps of 10 percent a day aren't a
125:32 - normal
125:34 - do you use vim i do not i've i've used
125:37 - it before
125:38 - but um then
125:41 - i don't i just like uh jet brains ides
125:45 - uh even though i know they have been
125:47 - plugged in so on and so forth but
125:50 - i don't want to seem like a i always
125:53 - feel this funny thing where um
125:55 - when people ask me about different
125:56 - software uh to give my answer it almost
125:59 - feels like in a way i'm like
126:00 - promoting them or something so
126:03 - jeopardians didn't pay me or anything
126:04 - but
126:05 - i mean i just really love their ides and
126:08 - for as complex as their ids and any are
126:12 - whenever they have a new release it's
126:14 - like majority of the time
126:16 - things just work so i don't know what
126:18 - their development process
126:19 - is but jet brains they got
126:23 - they got their stuff together tuna bacon
126:26 - cheese
126:26 - okay tbc wow the new boston coin tuned
126:30 - bacon cheese
126:31 - whoa all right when is flutter come in
126:34 - 2021
126:35 - what kind of knowledge can we look for
126:38 - about
126:38 - anonymous what resources can you uh
126:41 - advise me
126:43 - i actually left a post i think it was on
126:46 - reddit a while ago
126:48 - about uh the best thing that you can do
126:50 - to be anonymous
126:51 - um let's see let's just see how much i
126:54 - remember
126:55 - the first thing that you can do is well
126:58 - you need a device you need a device to
126:59 - connect with the internet
127:01 - and if you purchase that device using a
127:04 - credit card
127:04 - or using uh any type of means where they
127:08 - can track you
127:09 - even cash where okay there's a receipt
127:12 - for it but now a bunch of cameras
127:14 - pointing towards you
127:15 - then uh essentially then your identity
127:18 - is tied to it in one way or another
127:20 - especially with credit card or if you
127:21 - pay for it online
127:22 - then of course that device is always
127:24 - going to be tied to you so
127:26 - the best thing that you can do in that
127:27 - is probably get it at a flea market or
127:30 - get it from uh means where your identity
127:33 - is not tied to that device
127:35 - another thing is do not use windows for
127:38 - sure uh
127:42 - i don't know i would just stick with
127:44 - linux i'll say that and probably
127:46 - something like tails
127:47 - since it's an entire distribution built
127:50 - around privacy
127:51 - and then for that you essentially just
127:55 - need to go step by step
127:56 - of every bit along the network uh
128:00 - you want nothing tied to you as much as
128:03 - possible maybe use tor maybe use vpn
128:05 - so on and so forth but
128:10 - those are uh different means that you
128:12 - can use
128:18 - what stack would you choose in building
128:19 - your next big project so
128:22 - this would depend on what the project is
128:25 - for
128:26 - a web application i mean i i gotta rock
128:29 - with uh
128:33 - yeah it it also depends on the
128:36 - architecture if you want to distribute
128:38 - data
128:38 - uh micro service architecture uh is it a
128:41 - desktop application
128:43 - does it have heavy processing is it just
128:46 - a web application where you can
128:48 - just use django and scope scale
128:50 - horizontally so on and so forth
128:52 - but it it's um it's not a one
128:56 - programming language or one stack
128:58 - fits all solution it's more of what are
129:01 - you trying to achieve and then choosing
129:02 - the best
129:03 - technology to fit around that
129:07 - uh how do you compare react angular and
129:09 - view so
129:10 - i haven't used angular in a very long
129:12 - time i re
129:14 - view i know is lightweight react is i
129:19 - it's hard to find too many bad things
129:21 - about react especially with the growth
129:22 - the community
129:24 - um the popularity i
129:27 - of course i'm biased but come on how can
129:30 - you hate react
129:32 - okay let's see this
129:34 - [Music]
129:37 - uh what is your take on a lot of newbies
129:38 - learning python is their first language
129:40 - one of my friends
129:41 - learn it but he got stuck on easily
129:44 - because of simplicity yeah this was uh
129:47 - interesting as well because someone
129:48 - asked earlier
129:49 - about c and whether it was a good first
129:52 - language to learn
129:53 - so with python you aren't going to
129:55 - understand the concepts that you do with
129:57 - c
129:57 - with a pointers memory management with
130:00 - the low level things
130:01 - that you would typically learn but what
130:03 - it
130:05 - does provide especially for beginners is
130:07 - an easy entry into programming
130:09 - and they get to be familiar with
130:12 - programming and they don't get
130:13 - frustrated
130:14 - because of some of those more
130:15 - challenging concepts
130:17 - so i i would say it's a trade-off if
130:20 - they know that they want to understand
130:21 - the fundamentals of programming and how
130:24 - languages are built
130:24 - overall um i
130:28 - would recommend c but if they want to
130:33 - learn programming from a different
130:34 - perspective and maybe they don't care so
130:36 - much but they want to build great things
130:38 - and they want to
130:39 - build tools that they can use for their
130:42 - career
130:42 - later on then yeah python is fine
130:47 - [Music]
130:50 - okay let's see uh domains in the field
130:54 - of computer science have good pay and
130:55 - scope
130:56 - in the future so one of the things that
130:59 - has very good pay
131:00 - and i believe it had good pay for a
131:02 - while is um
131:03 - devops with network architecture cloud
131:06 - computing
131:07 - aws um learning about networking and
131:10 - devops
131:11 - is something especially focusing on
131:14 - cloud computing
131:15 - is something that is going to be
131:17 - increasing popularity
131:19 - and we're always going to need it and it
131:22 - is always one of the top paying career
131:25 - fields
131:26 - however what i would also suggest in
131:29 - this
131:30 - decision is you don't want to go
131:33 - into a career field strictly because it
131:36 - has high pay
131:37 - because even though it's gonna be great
131:40 - for a while a year or two
131:42 - you're gonna quickly find that you're in
131:45 - a position
131:46 - where you ended up in a career that you
131:49 - don't really enjoy
131:50 - and you're going to have to work for a
131:52 - very long time as most of us are
131:54 - before we reach retirement and given
131:57 - that such a large part of your life
132:00 - is going to be spent in the workplace
132:02 - you want to make sure that
132:06 - you don't need to like uh have it be
132:08 - your full passion but
132:09 - you need to or you should be
132:13 - in a job that makes you happy
132:15 - [Music]
132:18 - all right uh
132:23 - how do you become so good in so many
132:26 - languages
132:27 - uh i would say for any language it's
132:29 - just lots of
132:31 - studying if you're interested about it
132:33 - it helps a lot
132:34 - and i was genuinely interested about
132:36 - install m
132:38 - lots of different uh programming
132:40 - languages just because of what they can
132:42 - do
132:43 - so um
132:47 - yeah i think i think that's a big thing
132:48 - where if you're interested in something
132:50 - it it's a lot easier to become good at
132:53 - it because
132:55 - the motivation comes from yourself
132:58 - rather than external factors
133:02 - all right let's see machine learning in
133:05 - the future
133:06 - um yes this is a big thing people are
133:10 - requesting i didn't have it planned
133:12 - before this little you know uh
133:15 - live stream whatever you want to call it
133:17 - this turned out to be a very long test
133:19 - by the way
133:20 - but uh i am finding out now that a lot
133:22 - more people are interested in machine
133:24 - learning
133:24 - than i originally thought so that is
133:27 - moving up on the menu
133:30 - let's see spam okay a course on
133:34 - blockchain please
133:35 - come in soon toothbrush side of your
133:37 - headphones
133:39 - all right uh name tech i mentioned this
133:43 - but let me brief
133:44 - touch on it briefly what is the story
133:46 - behind tuna i started
133:48 - using tuna for variables as well as
133:50 - bacon
133:51 - not to be funny but to differ to allow
133:53 - beginner
133:54 - developers to differentiate between
133:56 - built-in keywords
133:58 - and their self-name variables since
134:00 - whenever i was learning programming
134:02 - i saw something like var num equals six
134:05 - and i
134:05 - it was hard for me to tell which was a
134:07 - built-in reserve keyword and then which
134:09 - was a variable name
134:11 - so that's when i started using uh tunein
134:13 - big and also it's kind of funny too so
134:17 - object tuna yeah that's what we're
134:19 - talking about
134:24 - let's see let's see okay these are
134:26 - moving pretty quick
134:27 - ah okay
134:32 - i find myself in a position where i
134:33 - can't do the practice because of the
134:35 - lack of thoughts about applications i
134:37 - can't think
134:38 - anything to practice uh
134:41 - so i believe you mean like um
134:44 - uh after you learn the concepts of a
134:46 - programming language it's hard to know
134:48 - where to go from there because
134:50 - uh it's just hard to come up with um
134:53 - ideas on
134:54 - things to create or maybe the ideas that
134:56 - you come up with are
134:57 - way too big like uh game development and
135:00 - of course
135:01 - if you're just learning the concepts
135:02 - it's hard to
135:04 - do game development
135:07 - so this is an interesting question um
135:12 - it's it's interesting because i kind of
135:14 - do things
135:15 - uh the inverse of that where it isn't so
135:18 - much i learn a certain
135:20 - concept or language and then later on
135:23 - um deciding what to build with it it's
135:26 - more so
135:27 - that i always have a vision
135:30 - or a project in mind and i know that
135:33 - just from just community of programmers
135:36 - that there are certain languages that i
135:38 - should learn to best create this
135:40 - so i would say that maybe that's a
135:42 - better avenue if you start with a
135:44 - project in mind
135:45 - and then learn technology in order to
135:48 - build that project
135:49 - it may give a little bit more clear
135:51 - direction uh motivation as well
135:54 - and just maybe overall so i'll try that
135:58 - holy moly okay webassembly spam coming
136:01 - on hot
136:04 - uh why do you go quiet for some time i
136:07 - would check out my hello world video
136:09 - it explains lots of that and let's see
136:12 - let's see
136:18 - uh did you try to restream for streaming
136:20 - so i was actually comparing a stream
136:22 - yard
136:23 - versus restream and caleb curry
136:26 - recommended streamyard so i just tried
136:28 - it i actually just uh
136:29 - set up my account and like bought the
136:32 - paper
136:32 - today seems to be pretty cool i did
136:35 - watch a review on
136:36 - restream vs stream yard and everything
136:39 - basically just said that it came down to
136:41 - preference and the uis look
136:44 - pretty similar so uh yeah
136:47 - now we're on streaming best mobile app
136:50 - framework
136:52 - [Music]
136:58 - this is a tough one as well i i don't
136:59 - know they're uh
137:01 - it seems to be uh kind of like
137:04 - reacting angular in view a lot of it
137:07 - honestly comes down to personal
137:12 - preference
137:14 - uh would you like elaborate on
137:16 - networking and cloud computing are there
137:18 - any topics you recommend to get started
137:20 - tcp uh writing your own server and php
137:23 - node
137:24 - so not so much writing your own server
137:25 - and php uh
137:27 - or node i would say start with the
137:30 - basics of
137:31 - networking as far as how do i p
137:34 - addresses work um in just the basics of
137:37 - overall network like
137:38 - uh difference between a router and a
137:41 - switch
137:42 - uh kind of more so
137:46 - the core networking fundamentals
137:49 - and then afterwards you can look into
137:51 - things like um
137:52 - aws and that seems to be a big one now
137:55 - and
137:56 - a lot of those have a pretty clear path
137:59 - for
137:59 - getting certified of a kind of a chain
138:02 - of certifications that you can go
138:03 - through
138:04 - and when you are applying for jobs
138:07 - certifications
138:08 - for cloud computing is a big thing so
138:11 - they'll tell you exactly through
138:12 - practice exams and guides
138:15 - what they are looking for and what you
138:16 - need to know to get those certifications
138:18 - but if you are actually looking for a
138:20 - job in cloud computing
138:22 - then i would
138:25 - essentially learn the basics and then go
138:27 - with aws certifications
138:29 - and that will get you to a really solid
138:31 - point
138:35 - uh let's see let's see let's see have
138:37 - you ever experienced burnout
138:39 - too much coding if it's possible to be
138:40 - burnt out
138:42 - of doing things which you like so
138:45 - uh there i did experience burnout before
138:49 - but it wasn't for it was because
138:53 - at work uh we were building software
138:56 - and it was software that i
139:00 - i wanted to create perfectly but
139:06 - it it like wasn't my idea or
139:09 - it was just like uh joining a company
139:10 - and creating software it wasn't
139:12 - something i was super passionate about
139:14 - as far as like uh the personal projects
139:17 - uh i wouldn't say i got burnt out it's
139:18 - just at the end of them
139:20 - like i made this application to predict
139:22 - uh what horses
139:23 - could win in horseradish racing for
139:26 - bedding
139:27 - uh that was pretty cool but i got to the
139:28 - end of it and then i saw that
139:30 - the uh the edge for the horse tracks
139:34 - like the casino basically was just way
139:36 - too high so
139:37 - i'm not burnt out for the projects that
139:41 - we work on is a community like for the
139:43 - open source project
139:45 - it's going to be very difficult to get
139:48 - burnt out
139:48 - just because you're not developing a
139:52 - project for like the sake of learning
139:54 - programming or anything even though a
139:55 - lot of people come and improve their
139:56 - skills on and so forth
139:58 - but it's goal
140:02 - at the end of it is a bigger meaning and
140:06 - that meaning is as long as the site is
140:10 - there it's
140:11 - never going to burn out
140:17 - so uh yeah i guess uh now that you got
140:19 - me thinking about it
140:20 - it's you can
140:23 - burn out in software development if you
140:25 - work on projects that
140:27 - you aren't really passionate about or
140:28 - don't really enjoy but
140:30 - when you have a project that you're
140:31 - really passionate about and something
140:33 - that you do enjoy
140:34 - it's almost like how can you get burned
140:37 - out by
140:38 - doing something you enjoy
140:41 - all right i am back from sleeping are
140:43 - you still streaming still streaming i
140:45 - was on stream for a couple hours that
140:46 - was a quick little nap
140:48 - how to start with self-driving cars from
140:51 - scratch wow
140:52 - okay uh i would start with my how to
140:54 - build a go-kart tutorial
140:57 - and then automate the crap out of it
141:01 - uh why collaboration with caleb and when
141:04 - you get to know him this man is teaching
141:06 - legend
141:07 - uh yeah caleb's awesome i just got to
141:10 - know him
141:10 - recently uh he reached out to me i
141:13 - joined this little
141:14 - discord community for youtubers and he
141:16 - was there and he just got talking
141:18 - and i don't know he is
141:21 - cool dude
141:25 - how do you learn something new
141:28 - uh i learn based on
141:33 - a bigger project that i'm trying to
141:35 - build and usually it's the
141:37 - technology that i know that i have to
141:38 - learn to build that project
141:41 - so uh it's essentially just part of
141:43 - figuring out how to build something
141:49 - all right all right what is your
141:52 - learning process this is a good one too
141:55 - i always i scroll down a little bit and
141:58 - then people leave ton of comment
141:59 - okay where'd you go where did you go
142:02 - where did you go question
142:03 - okay it looks like you're not gonna find
142:04 - that one again oh here we go
142:07 - sophisal drawl what is your learning
142:10 - process so
142:11 - my learning process now and as it was
142:14 - before is whenever i
142:15 - need to learn a new language or a new
142:17 - technology for the very first time
142:19 - first place i go is to amazon and i
142:23 - just look for the top rated books i look
142:25 - to make sure that they're
142:26 - recent if the technology itself is
142:28 - recent
142:30 - and then i get usually two or three of
142:33 - them
142:33 - just since i don't get to see the full
142:35 - preview and i do like
142:36 - ordering physical books still it's just
142:39 - uh a lot easier for
142:40 - me to read uh for some reason and then i
142:44 - just start going through it and i
142:45 - i have this thing actually
142:48 - i'll show you this little book stand
142:52 - that i can put my book in and have it
142:54 - right next to my computer
142:56 - and i just start going through page by
142:57 - page learning everything
143:00 - and if i can't find a really good book
143:04 - then what i like to do is uh go to udemy
143:06 - and see if they have any video courses
143:08 - as well as youtube for video courses or
143:11 - just different places online
143:13 - so through those means uh it's usually
143:18 - it usually gives me a pretty solid
143:19 - understanding and also recently what i
143:21 - like to do
143:22 - is go to udemyfirst and go through video
143:24 - course since it gives me
143:28 - since it gives me kind of a brief
143:30 - overview of the main concepts and then
143:32 - after that
143:32 - i would go to my book and get a little
143:35 - bit deeper dive into
143:36 - some of the concepts
143:39 - all right let's see
143:43 - winning on chad
143:48 - could you recommend any open source
143:50 - projects about beginners
143:52 - so yes uh all right hit the two
143:56 - i hate to keep bringing this up but um
143:58 - on
144:00 - so we have uh open source projects if
144:02 - you go to the new boston.com
144:04 - clam clown what if you go to the new
144:07 - boston.com and click on the little
144:09 - github link then we're building a
144:11 - digital currency
144:12 - and we are also very open to new
144:14 - developers
144:15 - so whatever your experience level
144:17 - whether you're brand new to programming
144:19 - and you just want to
144:20 - learn how to contribute to an open
144:21 - source project or if you
144:23 - are a senior developer engineer designer
144:26 - marketer seo uh we're building something
144:29 - that
144:29 - is in my mind going to be very big so
144:32 - uh yeah come on in we'll love to have
144:34 - you
144:38 - want to say thank you your videos help
144:39 - me out a lot in college well
144:41 - i am glad that they could help you
144:45 - and let's see
144:49 - okay someone submitting issues on the uh
144:52 - open source project
144:54 - right now how many programming languages
144:58 - do
144:58 - you know bucky so this is interesting
145:01 - because knowing a programming language
145:05 - is uh a little bit hard to define
145:08 - since uh there are programming languages
145:11 - that i typed like hello world before i
145:13 - wouldn't say i know those
145:14 - and even now being experienced as a
145:18 - like um developer uh knowing python on
145:21 - the back end
145:23 - it feels like it feels like the more i
145:26 - learn the more that i understand that i
145:28 - don't learn
145:29 - and even the developers of the python
145:31 - core team
145:32 - i would a lot of them feel like they're
145:34 - areas of the project that they don't
145:36 - know just because they
145:37 - only work on a certain subset at a time
145:39 - so
145:40 - it's uh difficult to answer
145:46 - yes thank you no need to spam i will
145:49 - read your questions
145:50 - however this spam is making it difficult
145:52 - to um
145:53 - kind of read all these different
145:57 - questions
146:02 - python web dev is any good yes i would
146:05 - say it is
146:06 - good crow academy i was inspired
146:10 - by your videos a lot years ago well
146:12 - thank you lots of new videos coming soon
146:16 - ai vs this is another one disaster
146:19 - master cool name by the way
146:20 - adverse blockchain what is which will be
146:24 - more in demand
146:28 - oh this is good i don't know what do you
146:31 - guys think
146:33 - both by the way are
146:36 - looking strong for the future
146:44 - yeah this one's thump me i guess uh i
146:47 - would say
146:48 - both
146:52 - i want to choose one but i can't i see
146:55 - both of them with a very bright
146:56 - future eagleheart says blockchain by far
147:00 - so go or rust
147:05 - man this is uh
147:08 - another tough one
147:10 - [Music]
147:13 - both of those are very good too
147:15 - [Music]
147:17 - watch your videos a lot in the past now
147:18 - i make 70k in a year creative dev
147:22 - sounding good uh do you have any
147:25 - tutorials regarding linux os
147:27 - for beginner yes i have uh intro to
147:29 - linux
147:30 - or maybe it's just called linux
147:31 - tutorials but uh if you type in the new
147:33 - boston linux then it'll pop up
147:37 - i like linux by the way
147:42 - ai seemingly has more options than
147:44 - blockchain ai could be integrated into
147:46 - almost
147:47 - anything
147:55 - interesting perspective
147:59 - do you have advice for getting started
148:00 - with the game modding
148:02 - this other question too uh for game
148:05 - modding i actually don't have to
148:06 - much experience with game modding
148:08 - believe it or not i'm not a big
148:09 - gamer myself which sounds weird since uh
148:14 - you know they're very
148:18 - big on programming and whatnot surviving
148:20 - the wilderness 3
148:21 - probably not that was
148:25 - maybe i think two is enough for that
148:31 - is ruby and aspect j dead i hate to say
148:34 - that any
148:36 - what technology would i consider that
148:38 - it's not that it's not to pick a
148:40 - technology
148:41 - that to say is dead um i don't know too
148:44 - much about aspect
148:46 - j uh ruby definitely not
148:53 - any video coming from machine learning
148:55 - complete project
148:57 - so machine learning is something that is
149:00 - okay it's definitely on the menu for
149:02 - 2021
149:04 - that's actually going to be a pretty fun
149:05 - series to make
149:09 - played played php is dead though
149:15 - [Music]
149:18 - don't hear too much buzz about php
149:21 - that's for sure
149:22 - nowadays dead is tricky to classify
149:25 - anything is that but
149:27 - yeah i probably wouldn't recommend going
149:28 - down php avenue
149:33 - python django i actually do have a
149:34 - python django series
149:39 - i actually uh now that you guys are
149:41 - talking about php what is the
149:43 - trend of php like you know they have
149:46 - those stack overflow uh you can pretty
149:47 - much see the trend of
149:49 - different technologies
149:55 - will you film tutorials about metasploit
149:58 - i think
149:58 - that i did actually
150:02 - yeah i think i have a series about
150:03 - metasploit
150:07 - every two interview for uh
150:10 - oh this is a good question ever took
150:13 - interview for a young dev what do you
150:14 - seek in a new dev
150:16 - so at uh my job i'm the director of
150:20 - engineering and have to hire a lot of
150:22 - people
150:23 - and there are times where
150:26 - people would come in and there would be
150:28 - experience developers
150:29 - and i'm working on a web application
150:32 - so there are experienced developers that
150:36 - are just familiar with different
150:38 - technologies or their attitude wasn't
150:40 - quite
150:41 - a right fit for the team and then there
150:43 - were younger developers that just got
150:45 - out of a boot camp
150:46 - or some that even learned on their own
150:49 - and they were really passionate about
150:51 - programming and they told me about all
150:53 - these side projects that they had
150:54 - going on on their own time and
150:58 - their attitude and the way that they
151:00 - approach
151:01 - learning and solving problems and the
151:04 - passion that they had
151:05 - is just uh it's a hands-down better fit
151:09 - than someone who's experienced and feels
151:11 - like not the best fit for the team
151:14 - so i would say for
151:17 - a young developer um
151:20 - if you're passionate about programming
151:23 - then
151:24 - apply for a job so this is another thing
151:27 - with developers
151:29 - with every developer out there you
151:30 - should be applying
151:32 - for jobs that are
151:35 - higher skill level than you think that
151:37 - you can get you should always be aiming
151:39 - higher than where you think
151:41 - because it's almost like
151:45 - the value of yourself as a software
151:48 - developer
151:48 - is what you teach the world that your
151:50 - value is
151:52 - so always aim higher apply for jobs
151:55 - higher than the position that you think
151:56 - you
151:57 - deserve and that would be
152:00 - my advice and even as a young developer
152:03 - um looking at your very first
152:07 - application it doesn't hurt to apply at
152:10 - places where you think you might be
152:11 - rejected
152:13 - the worst case scenario is that they can
152:16 - say
152:16 - no thanks and they say it politely and
152:18 - then you end up in the exact same
152:20 - situation as you were
152:21 - and nothing bad happened best case
152:23 - scenario is you get this job and you get
152:24 - to learn a bunch of cool stuff
152:27 - so yes it may be a little bit of
152:28 - pressure in the first uh
152:30 - week or two and you may have a bit more
152:32 - of a learning curve
152:33 - but that's what it's about pushing
152:35 - yourself and
152:37 - eamonn hunt why do you wear a hat while
152:41 - you're inside so i wear this hat because
152:44 - i have these headphones and you see how
152:46 - they're all like
152:48 - beat up inside so if i don't have this
152:51 - hat on
152:52 - specific specifically then these little
152:54 - flakes always get all over my ears and
152:56 - stuff
152:57 - so this is pretty much just uh an ear
152:59 - protector for these
153:01 - uh things that are flaking
153:02 - [Music]
153:04 - holy lots of spam here
153:09 - oh one second let me sift through the
153:11 - spam
153:13 - [Music]
153:16 - how are you doing this pandemic i'm
153:18 - digging it i'm digging the quarantine
153:19 - i mean you wake up you can wear shorts
153:22 - uh
153:23 - you know don't have to commute to work
153:26 - wear sweatpants it's not bad the whole
153:30 - you know what's going on and how it's
153:33 - impacting people's lives not that great
153:35 - bob
153:39 - all right please bring your videos here
153:41 - is about competitive programming so
153:43 - you're just a good
153:44 - source to learn it also how to join your
153:47 - open source project
153:48 - so the video series about competitive
153:50 - programming noted
153:52 - and how to join your open source project
153:54 - if you go to thenewboston.com
153:57 - then i would first suggest joining the
153:59 - slack community
154:01 - and for that on the home page you can
154:03 - click the little slack icon and if you
154:05 - just want to dig right into the code
154:07 - then you can either click on the little
154:10 - github logo
154:11 - or there's a section called tasks
154:14 - t-a-s-k-s that you can go and see
154:17 - everything there is to work on
154:20 - but for joining it i would highly
154:22 - recommend
154:23 - uh joining the stock community and then
154:26 - in
154:26 - intros introducing yourself telling us
154:28 - about your background and then
154:31 - uh we'll find a team to put you on
154:33 - because it just feels like people are
154:36 - more part of the community that way a
154:39 - little more engaged
154:41 - good morning from lagos nigeria what up
154:44 - over in lagos
154:45 - and this guy's name is or girl is oauth
154:48 - i like that very cool also nigeria
154:52 - is uh kind of doing awesome in uh
154:55 - cryptocurrency lately i i saw on google
154:57 - trends that nigeria is one of the
155:00 - top countries that has
155:03 - lots of interest in it did you ever try
155:06 - creating your own programming language
155:07 - bucky i did not
155:13 - r which language should i learn after
155:15 - java
155:17 - so this uh depends what you want to do
155:19 - with java
155:21 - maybe not another language but maybe uh
155:24 - something
155:25 - that is java specific
155:30 - [Music]
155:31 - why are you up at 2 a.m so from what you
155:35 - yep so for me it's on the uh oh midnight
155:38 - how long wow i thought i was streaming
155:40 - for like 40 minutes two and a half hours
155:43 - dang time flies all right
155:46 - views on flutter i am pro flutter and
155:49 - flutter's coming in 201
155:53 - uh flutter overreact
155:58 - it's uh debatable
156:06 - okay
156:08 - all right 2021 resolution 2021
156:12 - resolution uh
156:19 - the main thing is just so we have a road
156:22 - map for the digital currency project
156:24 - that i am looking forward to probably
156:27 - more than anything else in 2021
156:29 - and then aside from that i just want to
156:31 - make lots of videos
156:33 - i want to make a lots of uh tutorials
156:35 - and
156:36 - get everything up in a buzzing again i
156:38 - am
156:39 - very excited about that as well to get
156:42 - back into the groove of things
156:43 - and now that we have an open source
156:45 - project an awesome community
156:47 - uh i'm feeling very good about 2021
156:50 - especially compared to 2020
156:51 - which it really isn't 20 20 even set
156:54 - that high of a bar
156:56 - let's be honest so um just looking
156:58 - forward to 2021 in general
157:01 - also in general another thing about this
157:04 - is
157:04 - i'd i'm not a big fan of resolutions
157:06 - because
157:07 - i feel like if there's something in your
157:09 - life that you want to improve
157:11 - you shouldn't have to wait till january
157:12 - 1st is there something in your life that
157:14 - you want to improve
157:15 - you just start improving it right away
157:18 - in
157:18 - aside aside from that it's also a good
157:21 - read
157:22 - um interesting that i'm not a fan of
157:24 - retros so if you work
157:26 - for a software company you know you have
157:29 - retros
157:30 - like uh with each sprint at the end of
157:33 - it
157:34 - i feel like people just save up the
157:37 - problems
157:37 - for like every two weeks where it's like
157:40 - yo
157:40 - if there's a problem or something you
157:42 - think that we could improve
157:44 - then you could just like mention it like
157:46 - a week and a half ago when this came up
157:47 - didn't need to save it for retro but
157:51 - in a way new year's resolutions are
157:54 - kind of just like retros in a way like
157:56 - what can we do better next year
157:58 - uh so and so forth
158:01 - all right so object oriented
158:05 - is okay so the question was what is
158:07 - object oriented
158:08 - object oriented is uh
158:12 - like a design pattern where instead of
158:14 - programming with individual
158:16 - functions then you use something called
158:19 - uh
158:19 - classes in objects and it allows you to
158:24 - store like um
158:27 - how can i explain this it allows you to
158:29 - store like state and memory
158:31 - with certain bits of code
158:35 - it's kind of hard without a text editor
158:37 - in front of me showing everything but
158:39 - there you go 2021
158:42 - uninstall facebook and burn your tv that
158:45 - is actually not bad advice
158:47 - i already did uninstall facebook on all
158:49 - my uh mobile devices
158:53 - not because like i'm i'm not like a huge
158:56 - fan of facebook first of all but it
158:57 - seemed to be just be killing my battery
159:00 - and burn your tv i don't know if my tv
159:02 - would burn
159:03 - but also not that bad of device
159:07 - all right let's see how do you see the
159:08 - new boston in five years
159:10 - i have very high hopes for the new
159:13 - boston
159:14 - in five years um especially after i
159:16 - announced the
159:17 - digital currency project since it has a
159:20 - lot of support
159:21 - and it's growing very strong and
159:25 - we we're still in alpha right now not
159:28 - even in beta
159:29 - so i can't imagine when this thing gets
159:31 - the beta and after we have a marketplace
159:33 - release on exchange things are
159:36 - going to be happening very quickly
159:38 - looking forward to it
159:40 - waiting for flutter tutorial from new
159:43 - boston me too
159:44 - it's on the way uh when are they coming
159:47 - they're coming in 2021
159:48 - early 2021 it's one of the earliest
159:51 - things
159:52 - uh let's see let's see what up whoa okay
159:55 - lots of comments coming in all of a
159:57 - sudden
159:59 - uh how do you feel about visual coding
160:03 - uh visual coding
160:06 - i'm not i'm not familiar with visual
160:09 - coding
160:09 - what time is it bro it's 12 14 or i am
160:13 - slightly after midnight but it's
160:14 - saturday so whatevs
160:16 - we're just rolling with it how's it
160:18 - going
160:19 - going great actually uh this comment
160:22 - says and how to start a
160:23 - fire oh
160:27 - you taught me three languages and how to
160:28 - start a fire that's
160:30 - really the four things i wanted to
160:32 - accomplish in your life so
160:34 - as long as you know three new languages
160:35 - and how to start fire then yeah mission
160:37 - accomplished
160:40 - what is the bucky's language choice to
160:42 - build a web application in 2021 nothing
160:44 - fancy here
160:45 - i'm gonna go with uh for a web
160:47 - application
160:49 - as long as it's not too processing
160:52 - intensive
160:52 - i would just stick with uh python django
160:56 - and react on the front end especially
160:58 - with bringing on new developers or
161:00 - growing it i mean they're such popular
161:03 - languages
161:04 - and they're growing in popularity it's
161:06 - it's really
161:07 - nice to get a solid application up quick
161:10 - iterate and you know
161:11 - nothing bad to say about those can i buy
161:15 - some tmb currency
161:16 - not at the moment we are still in alpha
161:18 - but
161:19 - after this we go beta and then we
161:21 - release and then at that time we're
161:23 - going to be
161:23 - uh getting on exchanges so you can't buy
161:27 - it yet but you can
161:28 - earn it which language is best to learn
161:33 - game programming so this is actually
161:36 - interesting um
161:40 - look into
161:43 - unity so
161:47 - in uh also another thing about game
161:49 - programming is i'm not a game program i
161:51 - never made a
161:52 - like a production level game so i'm
161:55 - probably not the best person to ask
161:56 - about that colin jetpack or react
161:59 - who those are uh
162:03 - uh they're just uh different
162:05 - technologies for different things
162:09 - uh after okay so it's alpha beta and
162:12 - then
162:13 - the next stage in like the software
162:15 - development life cycle is
162:16 - stable release or some people call it
162:18 - production but basically
162:20 - alpha is like almost development uh beta
162:24 - is
162:24 - this should be ready but it probably
162:26 - still has some bugs that we have to iron
162:28 - out you know get it security audited
162:30 - tested and so on and so forth
162:31 - and then at the end of beta you feel
162:34 - that
162:34 - your software is ready to go uh there's
162:36 - no more bugs you can find no more
162:38 - security holes
162:39 - and it's ready for production release so
162:42 - it's it's either called a stable release
162:44 - or production you know depending on
162:46 - terminology you use it's the same thing
162:47 - though
162:50 - okay whoa lots of comments
162:54 - guys these duplicate comments they're
162:56 - filtering out all the
162:59 - good questions how many computers do you
163:01 - have now i only have
163:05 - okay i don't know if so i have five but
163:07 - three of them are laptops and two of
163:08 - them are laptops that i
163:09 - never use one's a linux one and one's a
163:12 - windows one just for
163:13 - when i need those but usually i develop
163:15 - on mac
163:16 - just because i just like their uh
163:18 - products and they're unix-based
163:20 - which is important for the things that i
163:23 - built
163:27 - uh let's see okay come back coming back
163:30 - come back
163:31 - uh i've been on tech was ripping off
163:34 - your content he owes you don't know who
163:36 - that is
163:37 - but yeah if you owes me then
163:41 - you know what are you gonna do about it
163:42 - yo me ivan
163:46 - okay i'm a college student with not too
163:49 - much experience
163:50 - in oss how do i support the digital
163:52 - currency project
163:54 - so if you don't have too much experience
163:57 - and you want to learn
163:58 - then that's fine then there's lots of
164:01 - different areas
164:02 - in the digital currency project which is
164:04 - a cool thing
164:05 - and some you don't even have to be a
164:07 - developer for we have a back-end team we
164:09 - have a front-end team
164:10 - we have seo we have marketing we have
164:13 - design
164:14 - we have people who are just community
164:16 - managers who help out around the
164:18 - community
164:19 - lots of different areas where even if
164:21 - you are a beginner developer and you
164:23 - want to
164:24 - kind of dip yourselves in open source
164:27 - development
164:27 - or you just want to hang out join the
164:29 - community that's cool come on in
164:31 - but lots of different areas and we
164:33 - accept lots of different skill levels no
164:35 - matter how
164:36 - new or how experienced you are so come
164:39 - in
164:39 - and we'll find a place for you
164:45 - computer specs so uh whenever i
164:49 - so on my macs they're pretty much maxed
164:52 - out aside from
164:54 - um the video card since i don't really
164:57 - do like uh
164:58 - video editing or i don't need a gpu for
165:01 - anything
165:02 - really just like programming you don't
165:04 - really need a
165:05 - lots of processing power and
165:08 - i believe my hard drive as well since
165:12 - a lot of the information i just store on
165:14 - the cloud
165:16 - okay let's see a local no code movement
165:22 - low code no code i'm not familiar with
165:25 - that actually
165:27 - loco no code
165:31 - what's your favorite ide i love
165:33 - jetbrains ide
165:35 - uh why upper keeps rejecting my profile
165:38 - i
165:39 - don't know and let's see tell me more
165:42 - about your crypto stuff
165:44 - what would you like to know would you
165:47 - consider making
165:48 - videos on ue4 or
165:51 - unity um i made a lot of videos
165:55 - on unreal engine before like quite a few
165:59 - i actually don't even remember if i made
166:01 - tutorials on unity or not
166:04 - but um probably not for the
166:10 - it a lot of these things i'm not sure of
166:12 - because a lot of it depends on what
166:13 - people want to see
166:15 - so
166:19 - okay bro you play video games i don't
166:22 - i'm not
166:22 - a gamer uh i play games
166:26 - i actually have a nintendo switch that i
166:27 - really like i like it
166:29 - because i can bring it on a plane and i
166:32 - don't know i just think it's uh pretty
166:33 - fun
166:34 - i like building or i like playing games
166:36 - that you like build systems
166:38 - like minecraft or i forgot these games
166:42 - but like you put things together and the
166:43 - system becomes more complex and more
166:45 - complex and you have to manage things
166:47 - i'm not a big fan of like first person
166:48 - shooters or anything like that
166:53 - all right all right what program
166:55 - language should i learn
166:56 - first uh if you don't know anything and
167:00 - just don't know where to start it's hard
167:01 - to go wrong with
167:04 - python
167:08 - [Music]
167:12 - okay man okay machine learning is
167:15 - quickly
167:16 - coming up on this how does a crypto get
167:19 - into an exchange
167:20 - so this is a james payne
167:24 - is this the same james that's a
167:25 - developer on the project
167:27 - so um there are different types of
167:29 - exchanges you have decentralized
167:31 - exchanges which are
167:35 - uh they are less uh official less
167:38 - regulated
167:39 - basically any exchange that
167:43 - allows people to add one type of
167:44 - cryptocurrency and trade it for another
167:46 - type of cryptocurrency
167:48 - uh most of the time when people talk
167:50 - about cryptocurrency exchanges they're
167:52 - talking about
167:52 - centralized exchanges like coinbase or
167:54 - kraken and in that case
167:56 - each of these have different their own
167:59 - rules on what you need
168:01 - to do to get in and a lot of them are
168:03 - kind of vague as well
168:05 - like the development community needs to
168:07 - be active or
168:08 - the cryptocurrency needs to be stable
168:10 - however the definition of active or
168:12 - stable so on and so forth
168:14 - are really in their hands but each of
168:16 - these exchanges essentially has a list
168:18 - of guidelines
168:19 - of what you need to do before you can
168:21 - apply to get on that exchange
168:23 - so it is different for each one any
168:26 - projects for horse racing i actually
168:28 - spent a lot of time uh building
168:32 - a application to analyze different
168:34 - horses
168:35 - um their different attributes
168:39 - and believe it or not there is a lot a
168:42 - lot of information
168:44 - when it comes to analyzing horses
168:47 - like not only their um their different
168:50 - speeds but their
168:51 - uh race history their parents
168:54 - their medication that they're on uh how
168:57 - they're racing
168:58 - uh the different turf and the firmness
169:00 - so on and so forth
169:02 - i had no idea that there's this much
169:04 - data but
169:05 - the reason that i really got into it was
169:08 - because
169:09 - first of all this horse track that is
169:11 - just uh cool to watch
169:12 - and i was
169:16 - interested in what factors uh resulted
169:19 - in horses winning the race and the main
169:22 - thing that i started out with
169:24 - is is it mainly the horse or is it
169:26 - something else because
169:28 - in a horse race you have the horse
169:29 - itself which you know it's genetics
169:32 - uh it's how it trained however but you
169:34 - also have the jockey
169:35 - and different jockeys have different win
169:37 - percentages
169:38 - mostly based on like experience but you
169:41 - also have trainers as well
169:43 - so the main thing i was trying to figure
169:44 - out is if you had a horse
169:46 - is a horse going to win no matter what
169:47 - jockey or what trainer has
169:49 - or if you had a horse that didn't
169:51 - perform so well
169:53 - but you gave a really nice jockey and a
169:55 - really strong trainer then would that
169:56 - have more of an impact
169:58 - and if it was the horse then how much
170:02 - did its race history matter how much
170:05 - does its age matter maybe some things
170:08 - that people don't think of really matter
170:09 - like how long is its tail
170:11 - well maybe uh most people just disregard
170:14 - that but maybe there is a strong
170:15 - correlation
170:16 - so just taking all of these different
170:18 - factors and then plugging them together
170:21 - where not only these individual factors
170:24 - that you can kind of wait but
170:25 - in combination as well where maybe this
170:27 - horse doesn't do good but it
170:29 - when it runs with this jockey on this
170:31 - type of turf then it always does good
170:33 - so just to find those things it was not
170:35 - only an interesting challenge to program
170:38 - but also to look at the results of okay
170:41 - this was what we decided uh is horse
170:44 - that's gonna
170:46 - be most likely to finish first and often
170:50 - so so here's the interesting thing as
170:53 - well
170:54 - on topic of all this and it's the last
170:55 - point and then i'll stop talking about
170:57 - horses but
171:00 - at first what i was doing whenever i was
171:02 - making this application
171:03 - is i was just using all these different
171:04 - variables to do like machine learning
171:06 - and figure out which
171:07 - horse would most likely come in first in
171:09 - the race i figured the horse that's most
171:12 - likely to come in first is the one that
171:13 - you want to bet on
171:14 - but that is not the case because what
171:17 - you also need to consider
171:19 - is the rate in which they will win so
171:22 - if there is a horse that you think
171:25 - has a 60 chance of winning a race
171:28 - now if that horse wins then you might
171:31 - get like
171:32 - um 20 on your money so if you bet a
171:34 - dollar you might get a dollar tony back
171:37 - now so let's say that horse had a 60
171:40 - chance of winning there can be another
171:42 - horse that only has a 40
171:45 - chance of winning but if this horse wins
171:47 - then you
171:48 - triple your money so you essentially
171:50 - just can't
171:52 - run it through this algorithm and look
171:53 - at the results because it it doesn't
171:55 - give you the best results over time what
171:57 - you need to do is run it through more
171:59 - realistic
172:00 - simulation uh considering the betting
172:02 - odds as well
172:04 - and whenever i did that
172:07 - what my program uh did is it really
172:10 - really loved to gamble on the underdog
172:12 - horses almost
172:14 - every one of its picks was like a forty
172:16 - to one undershot
172:17 - or or uh an underdog so
172:20 - it really loved finding these horses
172:23 - that had a pretty
172:24 - low chance of winning now the
172:27 - interesting thing in all of that
172:29 - was that these horses that any normal
172:32 - human being would go to horse track and
172:34 - they would see oh this
172:35 - horse has no chance uh the program was
172:39 - very good at picking these underdog
172:42 - horses that had
172:43 - that ended up in the top three very
172:46 - often
172:47 - so uh it was just
172:51 - the results that i thought it was going
172:53 - to give
172:54 - was so different than what it actually
172:56 - gave and what it
172:58 - said was the best formula and um i don't
173:01 - know it's just
173:01 - something interesting so yes in exile 5a
173:05 - that was my
173:06 - long answer to that
173:09 - oh okay i keep seeing these things
173:13 - and i try to read it but then it pops
173:14 - down
173:16 - okay
173:17 - [Music]
173:21 - vs code or pycharm i mean i gotta go
173:23 - with pie jar
173:25 - i'm very biased towards jet brains ides
173:29 - roller coaster tycoon that is a good one
173:32 - actually looked in that for switch but
173:33 - it didn't have that high of a rating so
173:38 - uh is the stream being uploaded this is
173:40 - actually the second stream
173:41 - and it was it's just like a test stream
173:43 - that is turning into a longer stream
173:46 - so is it being uploaded i would say yeah
173:48 - i can save it it's cool
173:52 - can devops engineers do development work
173:54 - also
173:55 - uh that just depends on your skill set
173:57 - we have some devops engineers that are
173:58 - also
173:59 - backend engineers and that's mainly
174:01 - because
174:02 - uh so when writing scripts it's usually
174:06 - a lot of it is python scripts in a lot
174:08 - of cases
174:09 - so yeah they definitely can
174:14 - okay let's see university student with
174:17 - not much experience is there any way to
174:19 - contribute to
174:20 - coins so yes uh
174:23 - the cool thing about this project in the
174:24 - new boston open source development
174:27 - community
174:27 - is there is no restriction on the
174:30 - experience level
174:31 - whether you're just starting out in
174:33 - programming whether you've been
174:34 - programming for a long time
174:36 - there is a position for everyone so come
174:38 - on in join a community we would love to
174:41 - have you
174:42 - and if you're new to open source
174:44 - development then
174:45 - you can learn you get better that's what
174:47 - everything's about here
174:49 - is it an erc20 it is not it is
174:52 - something completely different than
174:54 - anything that exists
174:55 - however we are going to have a wrapped
174:57 - coin to get it on these decentralized
175:00 - exchanges
175:01 - so just like wrap bitcoin we're gonna
175:03 - have uh wrap the new boss in
175:05 - which is gonna be an erc20 coin uh for
175:08 - that reason
175:12 - will this channel focus mostly on
175:13 - cryptocurrency now or other stuff too
175:15 - so we only have two more well one is
175:18 - partly done
175:19 - the digital currency tutorial series and
175:21 - the other one is the
175:23 - account manager series we have planned
175:25 - which is essentially the desktop
175:26 - application that we have for connecting
175:28 - to the network
175:29 - but then after that uh it's
175:32 - it's pretty much just going to be back
175:34 - to basics with
175:35 - uh docker aws flutter lots of
175:38 - programming lots of software related
175:40 - tutorials
175:41 - but for now since there is a big barrier
175:44 - for people understanding what the
175:45 - project's all about
175:46 - and how everything works i do want to
175:48 - get these tutorials out there
175:50 - and pumped out just so you know it kind
175:52 - of helps development
175:53 - but then in 2021 pretty much going back
175:56 - to basics
176:01 - okay let's see let's see let's see
176:08 - would you rather fight to the death with
176:10 - five chicken sized horses
176:13 - or a one horse-sized chicken five
176:16 - chicken-sized
176:16 - horses oh i could crush shows
176:20 - i could crush those horses easily i mean
176:22 - it would be no contest
176:25 - and then one horse-sized chicken that
176:27 - may be a little bit more of a battle i
176:29 - can see that
176:30 - messing me up pretty bad so definitely
176:33 - uh
176:34 - would be happy to fight five
176:35 - chicken-sized horses i would just
176:36 - absolutely demolish them
176:39 - all right i'm not really gonna
176:42 - hurt those animals by the way unless
176:45 - they come after me first then game on
176:46 - you know
176:49 - project is going to be so successful our
176:52 - project
176:52 - first of all but uh thank you and i
176:56 - agree
176:57 - thank you for the support
177:02 - why do vulnerabilities occur all the
177:04 - time is because when something
177:06 - gets updated it's just because um
177:10 - technology grows quickly
177:13 - and when you grow things quickly there
177:15 - are just some spots that
177:17 - kind of just like bugs where
177:21 - building anything uh quickly there are
177:23 - some areas that you
177:24 - overlook uh different use cases that you
177:27 - didn't consider
177:28 - especially with users where you expect
177:31 - them to use your software in a certain
177:33 - kind of way
177:34 - but they almost never do and they find
177:36 - all kinds of new ways to break it
177:38 - a lot of it is unintentional as well
177:42 - glider back computer science
177:46 - okay how can you earn crypto so
177:49 - the crypto that we are building the idea
177:52 - behind it
177:53 - is that the value comes from what you
177:55 - put into it so you earn it
177:57 - by improving the network fixing bugs
178:00 - joining a team
178:00 - helping out the community so on and so
178:02 - forth but
178:04 - it's not anything that as of now you can
178:06 - buy on any exchange
178:08 - mainly because there is still an alpha
178:10 - now and the network is young
178:12 - but no buying so far you have to earn it
178:16 - by helping out the network or helping
178:17 - out the project
178:18 - [Music]
178:20 - all right all right all right how much
178:23 - were your
178:24 - crypto be worth min twin
178:28 - um so that is actually going to be up to
178:31 - the market
178:33 - i am assuming hoping
178:36 - quite a quite a bit chat is too fast wtf
178:40 - why am i burping all the time now
178:44 - nice uh chad is too fast wtf i agree
178:48 - tala not even gonna say that just
178:50 - embarrass myself i like turtles me too
178:55 - aren't the horses euthanized when they
178:57 - are injured
179:00 - uh yeah i believe so
179:06 - and that and that was actually uh a big
179:07 - thing at the race
179:09 - well i'm sure you guys don't want to
179:10 - hear about horse racing all the time
179:12 - but um yeah just one last thing at the
179:16 - horse track
179:16 - in or it's not actually in pasadena but
179:19 - san anita real quick close to where i
179:21 - live
179:21 - there's like a a record number of horses
179:24 - being injured on the track that they
179:26 - have to put down
179:27 - and no one really understands why all
179:29 - these horses like
179:30 - it's not more than average it's like
179:32 - this crazy amount of horses that keep
179:34 - getting injured
179:35 - at this one specific track and they
179:37 - thought it was
179:39 - something with the firmness of the track
179:42 - or something like that but yeah it's
179:45 - just like a big mystery in the horse
179:46 - racing community
179:48 - on this track why do horses keep getting
179:50 - injured
179:51 - uh let's see
179:57 - how do you market yourself as a
179:58 - developer i would say
180:00 - by
180:04 - through your skills through your skills
180:07 - uh
180:08 - just being a very strong developer
180:13 - all right probably got a couple more
180:14 - questions here
180:16 - then i gotta peace out oh favorite food
180:21 - i do like some mac and cheese ah let's
180:23 - see
180:25 - what's your guys favorite food
180:30 - pizza especially 99 cent pizza in new
180:33 - york city
180:35 - can't beat it
180:38 - wow that's all it thoughts
180:45 - all right do you still use ergonomic
180:47 - mouse and glows
180:52 - i have to ergonomic mouse in this
180:55 - without it
180:57 - carpal tunnel symptoms get uh pretty bad
181:02 - i watch your video on ten standard after
181:04 - eight years started my own channel
181:05 - you're my inspiration
181:07 - bucky desi coder thank you very much
181:10 - actually i'm gonna check out your
181:11 - channel desi coder
181:14 - how can i join the project if you go to
181:17 - thenewboston.com
181:19 - there is a section that says join the
181:21 - community in one of the menus
181:23 - then you can either join slack or github
181:25 - so on and so forth
181:26 - but i would recommend joining slack and
181:28 - gal
181:30 - why are you using a headphone uh
