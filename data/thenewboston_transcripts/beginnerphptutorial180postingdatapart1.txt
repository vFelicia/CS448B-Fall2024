00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:03 - and this is a video tutorial for the new
00:05 - Boston now in this Ajax series we've
00:09 - already looked at using the XML HTTP
00:15 - variables we've been using and we've
00:17 - been we've been posting data to our page
00:22 - using the get get method so we've been
00:26 - picking data up in our include file
00:30 - using dollar underscore get now what if
00:33 - we want to send post data through to
00:36 - another file so we're going to do
00:38 - exactly the same format as we've done
00:40 - before but this time we're going to
00:41 - create a little program or script rather
00:44 - that allows us to have an input box on
00:48 - the page and a submit button now when
00:50 - they user clicks this submit button
00:52 - we're going to be transformed a
00:53 - transferred sorry obviously using Ajax
00:56 - to update dot PHP and what this is going
00:59 - to do is it's going to insert a piece of
01:03 - data if you like into the database so
01:06 - let's first of all have a look at the
01:07 - database structure and what we're
01:09 - actually going to be doing here so ID we
01:11 - can ignore this for now this is a
01:12 - primary key and it's Auto increment so
01:14 - if you're following along this tutorial
01:16 - and you want to create this table we've
01:19 - got the database called Ajax the table
01:21 - called data and inside of this we've got
01:24 - the ID and data field so ID like I just
01:27 - said it's an integer data type it's the
01:30 - primary key and we've got an auto
01:31 - increment so for every insert we make to
01:36 - this thing for every record we create
01:38 - this is going to be an auto incrementing
01:39 - value if you've watched my other
01:41 - tutorials on databases you'll understand
01:44 - what this is if not go back and have a
01:46 - look at them so data is just simply
01:48 - going to be the just a string of data it
01:51 - will literally just be a string of data
01:53 - so where this example is just going to
01:55 - demonstrate how to input something onto
01:58 - there and then hopefully you can come
01:59 - away from this knowing how to use this
02:02 - post this post method through Ajax and
02:05 - you can incorporate this into your own
02:07 - website with posting data
02:11 - okay so the first thing we're going to
02:13 - do is design our form so let's go back
02:15 - over to our index dot PHP file and we'll
02:18 - start to create a rough outline of our
02:20 - page so here we've got our root HTML
02:23 - tags then our head tag and then our body
02:26 - tag so inside head we're going to be
02:28 - putting the function that's actually
02:31 - going to update the database well it's
02:33 - going to cool Ajax and then and then
02:35 - post the data this updating dot PHP so
02:38 - we're going to transfer data from the
02:40 - form to this function or call this
02:43 - function which is going to pick up this
02:44 - specific field on the form using the get
02:47 - element by ID in JavaScript and then we
02:50 - going to get the value of that form and
02:52 - submit it through so that's just a rough
02:55 - outline of what we're going to be doing
02:56 - so first of all we're just going to
02:58 - create an area where we will eventually
03:00 - write our Ajax into so we've got a
03:03 - script type and we'll end the script
03:05 - there remember the type is text
03:07 - JavaScript because Ajax is essentially
03:10 - JavaScript and XML so inside of our body
03:15 - what we need to do well the first thing
03:17 - I'm going to do is just simply create a
03:20 - label so I'm going to say in insert I'm
03:23 - going to say insert and then I'm going
03:25 - to create an input field with a type
03:30 - text and the name of this is going to be
03:35 - let's call it an insert text in fact
03:41 - we'll just call it text for now that
03:42 - will keep things simple okay so now what
03:47 - we want to do is we want to create a
03:49 - button so let's create an input type
03:53 - button will give this a value of submit
03:58 - and we want to say unclick equals and we
04:01 - want to call a function name now the
04:04 - function name will be inside here which
04:06 - will then process this update dot Inc
04:09 - dot PHP using Ajax so I'm going to call
04:14 - the function let's say insert
04:19 - okay so we've called this insert
04:22 - function which obvious obviously at the
04:24 - moment doesn't exist so let's create
04:26 - that now okay so just to give you an
04:32 - idea of what this program well how this
04:34 - is going to work what we're going to do
04:36 - is we're going to make an alert quickly
04:38 - just to check that this function is
04:40 - being cooled properly so I'm just going
04:42 - to write okay in there so let's go back
04:45 - to and preview our our HTML so we've got
04:48 - insert we've got a text value here that
04:49 - we can type in so we can type a value
04:53 - into here and then click Submit and it
04:55 - should be alerted by calling this
04:57 - function so let's try just type in test
05:00 - click Submit and we get okay back now
05:04 - let's try and access this this value
05:08 - here this this text value here so I'm
05:11 - going to say we'll just create a new
05:16 - variable called
05:18 - [Music]
05:21 - let's say text value and that's going to
05:24 - equal get element by ID and that is text
05:32 - dot value
