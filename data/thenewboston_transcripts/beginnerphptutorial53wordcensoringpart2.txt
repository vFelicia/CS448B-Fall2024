00:00 - now just to point out before we go any
00:02 - further
00:03 - these values are lowercase so if I was
00:05 - to type an uppercase into here so Alex
00:09 - as opposed to Alex it's not going to
00:11 - recognize there so I'm going to
00:12 - introduce a couple more functions a bit
00:14 - later on that are going to deal with
00:16 - that as well to make sure that people
00:18 - can't get around things like this I mean
00:20 - this isn't a foolproof but it's just an
00:22 - example of how we can use this string
00:25 - replace function so we've got our user
00:28 - input now what do we need to do we need
00:29 - to say user input news so we can create
00:33 - a new variable and this is going to be
00:35 - STR replace and inside of here we need
00:39 - to take our three arguments now in power
00:41 - three arguments the first one is going
00:44 - to be what to find then what to replace
00:46 - and then the user input so finding what
00:52 - whatsoever in this array so each element
00:53 - of this array remember this will
00:56 - automatically take each element of the
00:58 - array and search for it and then this
01:00 - will take each element of this array and
01:02 - set and replace with the corresponding
01:05 - value so and user input is obviously
01:07 - what the user has entered
01:09 - so now let's echo echo out the user
01:12 - input new and see what result we achieve
01:17 - so if I just type any old text in here
01:22 - and click Submit obviously we're not
01:25 - filtering anything we're not replacing
01:27 - anything there but if I was to type type
01:30 - the an example let's say today I went
01:34 - out with Alex Alex Billy and Dale and I
01:40 - click Submit you can see that these have
01:42 - now been replaced so it's quite nifty
01:44 - nifty thing today so now what happens if
01:47 - I have a capital A for Alex say on a
01:50 - capital D for Dale or you could have a
01:53 - capital L in the middle or something
01:54 - like that
01:55 - let's click Submit and see what happens
01:57 - now you can see that Alex and Dale and
01:59 - now have not been recognized as starred
02:02 - or asterisks to our text so how how can
02:06 - we you know
02:09 - protect against this well what we want
02:12 - to do is we want to create a new
02:16 - variable called in user input a cooler
02:21 - LC standing for lower case and I'm going
02:24 - to say STR to lower this is a another
02:27 - function in PHP another string function
02:29 - its string to lower case and that is
02:34 - user input so now what we can do is say
02:40 - user input lower case rather than the
02:43 - user input itself and you will see if we
02:49 - refresh now you can see that these have
02:53 - been started out however we've been
02:55 - faced with the problem that now
02:56 - everything is lower case we've converted
02:59 - this whole sentence to lower case
03:01 - however we do have a solution for this
03:04 - and this is to completely change the
03:06 - function that we use now don't panic
03:08 - because it's not particularly hard so
03:12 - I'm going to get rid of this LC here and
03:14 - get rid of this lower case version here
03:15 - and we have to make one simple change
03:17 - and that is using the STR I replace
03:22 - function so now what we can do is we can
03:24 - take in input and everything that we use
03:27 - is now going to be case insensitive so
03:30 - let's just try and click Submit again
03:33 - now what you can see is that we've used
03:36 - an alux with a capital A a Billy with a
03:38 - small B and add a tail with a capital D
03:43 - however we've maintained the structure
03:45 - of our sentence with being the case that
03:47 - we've specified but we've also changed
03:51 - the words and the only thing we haven't
03:55 - done is maintain the capital D B and a
03:57 - on that but that that really doesn't
04:00 - matter I mean depending on the way your
04:02 - program works then it's not a massive
04:05 - issue and for this example it's not
04:07 - going to be a massive issue so that's
04:09 - basically we've introduced you to a new
04:12 - function STR I replace and also earlier
04:15 - the STR lower function as well so this
04:18 - is basically how to create a little
04:20 - sensor and
04:21 - with the functions that hopefully you've
04:23 - already learnt about if you haven't
04:25 - learned about these functions and you
04:26 - are confused at this point go back and
04:29 - have a look at the functions on their
04:31 - own and just try to determine how to use
04:34 - them before you start combining to
04:36 - create things like this
