00:00 - all right everybody welcome back to
00:02 - another video and in this video honestly
00:05 - I have no idea what I'm going to be
00:07 - doing yet I have to go through the
00:09 - backlog and pick out some tickets
00:11 - it's probably going to be super super
00:13 - boring video not exciting at all would
00:16 - not recommend watching it's gonna be
00:18 - super dumb
00:19 - and on that note let's just go ahead and
00:21 - get started all right
00:23 - now that we got everyone out of the way
00:25 - let's actually build something cool and
00:27 - awesome okay
00:29 - so I'm probably just going to start at
00:31 - the very bottom and take care of some of
00:34 - this Tech that I know last time I said I
00:36 - wanted to start on the social feature
00:37 - but what I want to do is kind of Polish
00:40 - things up get them where I want before
00:43 - we build anything new
00:45 - now the first thing is empty States
00:47 - right here
00:49 - so yeah let's just tackle this one
00:52 - okay so what this means is that
00:56 - and let me actually get some empty
00:58 - States actually let me just check out
01:00 - this ticket and we can get started
01:02 - officially
01:03 - so pull this down
01:07 - am I recording I'm always
01:10 - confused if I'm recording or not even
01:12 - though I made like 5 000 videos so far
01:14 - okay 28 empty States
01:20 - all right now what this means is
01:25 - basically when you don't have any
01:27 - elements and we already did it for the
01:29 - shop app
01:31 - actually let me delete my products here
01:34 - so we can see one of our empty States
01:37 - okay
01:39 - so this was one of the empty States uh
01:42 - basically just some element rather than
01:45 - having an empty screen whenever we don't
01:47 - have any elements
01:48 - but I like this one right here so let's
01:51 - just pull this up off the bat since we
01:53 - can use that as a reference
01:56 - okay
01:58 - so this
02:00 - was using an empty page component
02:04 - so that is going to be handy
02:07 - minimize YouTube
02:09 - and we'll kind of just go through the
02:12 - existing features and see what needs an
02:13 - empty state so first of all this Wallace
02:16 - page I'll show you I already have
02:18 - wallets in there now but
02:20 - am I on localhost yes
02:24 - all right so let me just delete all of
02:26 - these
02:29 - and I'll show you the empty state for
02:31 - this and let me make sure I'm getting
02:32 - the true empty state by logging out
02:33 - logging back in
02:35 - well first we're going to do for Cores
02:37 - but we'll do it for wallets right now so
02:40 - that
02:41 - um this UI as you just saw you can
02:43 - create a new wallet and then when you do
02:45 - it's going to appear on the left and
02:48 - then once you create all the wallets
02:49 - possible then that button disappears so
02:52 - we don't really need an empty state for
02:54 - this part of it
02:56 - but I'm just going to go ahead and
02:57 - delete those wallets again
03:00 - just so uh we're working from a true
03:02 - empty State and also
03:05 - on the right you see where we have
03:08 - deposit and withdraw first of all this
03:11 - doesn't even make sense to have any of
03:13 - these selected outside the context of a
03:15 - wallet because first you need to have a
03:17 - wallet selected and then
03:19 - you basically are depositing or
03:21 - withdrawing from your wallet but either
03:25 - way a lot of work to do here
03:28 - um
03:29 - first and foremost what we can do
03:33 - is we can say if no wallet on the left
03:36 - is selected
03:37 - then just go ahead
03:39 - and show an empty State instead of these
03:42 - tabs
03:44 - so basically at this point if we don't
03:46 - have anything selected then just do that
03:49 - so let's get to this right now
03:52 - so on my wallets page in actually
03:56 - another thing that we could do
03:59 - is instead of just I mean it wouldn't be
04:02 - an improvement
04:03 - let me take that back I'm stumbling over
04:05 - my words here it would be an improvement
04:08 - to have a Graphic here to say like
04:11 - nothing here no wallets to display
04:12 - however what's even better than that is
04:15 - to give them a prompt to say something
04:17 - like nothing here select a wallet on the
04:20 - left
04:21 - I don't know some guidance at least but
04:23 - we'll kind of do that later for right
04:25 - now just uh taking baby steps here
04:28 - okay so back to my wallets page and that
04:32 - is in Pages wallets
04:34 - and how is this structured
04:39 - so I've rebuttoned the creative wallets
04:41 - or tabs at the top okay
04:44 - so on the right hand side
04:48 - what we were saying is render Tab and
04:50 - render tab content
04:53 - and instead
04:55 - what I believe I want
04:59 - something like this where we say render
05:02 - page content
05:04 - or even just render content
05:07 - maybe render right content that's going
05:10 - to be good
05:11 - oh yeah
05:15 - the render right content
05:26 - content and then what we'll do is first
05:30 - of all we'll just go ahead and
05:33 - return this
05:39 - so we
05:42 - are getting back to where we started
05:45 - and then we'll add some conditional
05:46 - logic
05:48 - so on the right hand side we're going to
05:50 - call the render right content function
05:54 - and right now it just renders what it
05:57 - did before however what we want to say
06:00 - is if you don't have anything selected
06:02 - and how do we pull that logic
06:07 - is it manager active wallet
06:17 - so we can say this
06:22 - tab content is manager active volat tab
06:26 - okay
06:27 - so in Redux
06:29 - our manager has an active wallet ID an
06:34 - active wallet tab so the ID is going to
06:37 - be something like equivalent to tnb or
06:39 - VTX and the tab is the deposit and
06:42 - withdraw
06:44 - so what I'm going to say is if there's
06:46 - no active wallet
06:54 - manager active ballot ID
06:58 - yeah I might want to change this to
07:04 - Hmm this is interesting
07:11 - okay let's
07:13 - okay let's take it just a little bit at
07:14 - a time okay
07:16 - so first I'll just keep it simple and
07:19 - I'll say if there is no
07:24 - manager active wallet ID
07:28 - and let's just go ahead and return null
07:30 - off the bat
07:38 - all right if they don't have any active
07:40 - wallet selected then returning null
07:42 - instead of tabs and this is going to
07:44 - give us our tabs
07:46 - okay
07:48 - so lots of work to do here
07:52 - but now your refresh this actually log
07:55 - back out log back in okay
07:58 - so I don't have anything so I'm just
07:59 - going to render that null however in
08:01 - this case what we want to do is we want
08:03 - to render an empty page
08:09 - and maybe this is easier
08:15 - yeah I kind of like this pattern so
08:20 - if you do have an active wallet
08:24 - and just go ahead and return that
08:26 - otherwise return that empty page
08:29 - and I'm going to copy empty page from
08:31 - this component
08:37 - and also do you need a graphic
08:41 - leaves empty state
08:53 - buys render this and let's see how you
08:57 - do that
08:58 - all right
08:59 - so this is good nothing here no products
09:03 - to display
09:08 - hmm
09:10 - so the thing about this is in this case
09:13 - when I have a wallet on the left what I
09:16 - would like this to say
09:19 - oh you know what we're going to change
09:21 - this is he as well
09:24 - because what I was thinking is this
09:28 - um if there is a wallet on the left then
09:30 - what I could do is update this prompt to
09:32 - say select the wallet on the left to see
09:34 - content however if there is no wallet on
09:37 - the left then we probably want the
09:39 - prompt to say something like create a
09:41 - wallet
09:42 - to see content
09:44 - now
09:48 - the reason that I don't think we need
09:50 - that complex logic and instead we can
09:53 - just say create a wallet is because once
09:55 - a wallet is created
09:57 - then the default logic I'm going to add
09:59 - later
10:00 - is that
10:02 - um basically like whenever users log out
10:04 - and come in if they have a wallet it's
10:06 - just going to automat automatically
10:08 - select everything for them
10:10 - um
10:11 - so in that case
10:14 - with all that said well I can say in
10:17 - here is nothing here
10:20 - select or create a wallet
10:27 - to uh I don't know create a wallet
10:33 - what can I say nothing here
10:39 - the bottom fix is a great a wallet
10:43 - to
10:45 - deposit or withdraw coins
10:58 - create a wallet
11:01 - to deposit or withdraw coins
11:03 - and also another thing that I believe I
11:06 - can add to this element this empty page
11:08 - element
11:11 - is on action text
11:15 - so action text could be something like
11:18 - uh
11:22 - great wallets
11:25 - say on action text click and this can be
11:28 - my click Handler and I'll show you what
11:29 - this is doing right now
11:31 - so this action text is
11:37 - yeah so you see that this is just static
11:40 - text and I don't know if you can tell on
11:42 - YouTube but this is actually clickable
11:43 - uh this should be a different color
11:45 - actually let me change this to make this
11:47 - a little bit more
11:49 - so on my empty State component
11:54 - what I can do
11:58 - is we can say on action text
12:01 - spam blue and right now spam blue is 500
12:05 - let's
12:07 - bring that back a shade to 400.
12:10 - okay so now it's uh clear that this is a
12:12 - little bit more clickable but anyways
12:14 - I'll say create a wallet
12:18 - all right now let's go back here
12:21 - all right so the bottom text is going to
12:24 - say
12:25 - to deposit or withdraw coins in the
12:28 - action text we'll say create a wallet
12:35 - so deposit withdraw coins click on this
12:37 - to create a wallet and this is going to
12:39 - do the same logic as this button right
12:41 - here
12:43 - so in that case
12:46 - our render button container
12:49 - okay so on click toggle wallet modal
12:53 - and then where are you at render content
12:57 - when you click it you're also going to
12:59 - pop up this modal so check it out uh
13:02 - here it's going to say depository coins
13:04 - create a wallet you create it and this
13:06 - mode pops up
13:07 - boom boom boom okay
13:10 - now another thing that I want to do
13:15 - is this
13:18 - let's delete our wallets and keep coming
13:20 - back here from the perspective of an end
13:22 - user
13:23 - oops
13:26 - until we get all the logic that we want
13:29 - so I'm logging out I'm logging in
13:31 - wallets okay this is good so far great
13:35 - wallet button on the left empty State on
13:37 - the right now I want to say
13:41 - create a wallet I'm going to create this
13:43 - wallet and boom right there
13:45 - now at this point in time
13:49 - what I'm gonna do
13:51 - is I actually want this state to happen
13:54 - right after they create the wallet
13:56 - and what that entails
14:00 - if we can just take this break it down
14:02 - even more
14:04 - is it's going to require two actions one
14:09 - is you're going to update your manager
14:12 - set the active wallet ID and another
14:15 - is you're going to update the manager to
14:17 - set the active wallet tab
14:21 - so where is that logic going to go
14:27 - and I'm thinking this left section can
14:29 - just house that
14:32 - on this note we probably want to start
14:34 - splitting up this component
14:40 - so the left menu
14:42 - has bun container and the menu items
14:49 - menu items
15:00 - in the button container what are you
15:02 - doing
15:03 - so you have a toggle in there for the
15:05 - modal
15:10 - okay
15:12 - so maybe I just stick it in this entire
15:16 - page
15:26 - okay now let me think how this is going
15:29 - to work
15:32 - what I'm thinking first is even though
15:37 - um
15:37 - so basically the logic I'm going for is
15:40 - going to say something like this
15:42 - log out I know you guys are probably
15:44 - getting sick of me logging out and
15:45 - logging back in but basically if you go
15:48 - to this page and there is an available
15:51 - wallet
15:52 - then just go ahead and set this to your
15:55 - active wallet and set the default tab to
15:57 - deposit
15:58 - and this is only going to happen if the
16:01 - user doesn't have a wallet selected yet
16:04 - because basically if there are options
16:06 - but they have no nothing visible then
16:09 - that's what we want now what I can do is
16:12 - I can check for this in the manager
16:14 - however we also get into a weird
16:17 - situation
16:18 - this is very rare but they can indeed
16:21 - have an active wallet ID
16:25 - but no active wallet and that is if they
16:29 - created a wallet but then the core gets
16:32 - deleted
16:34 - and in that case
16:37 - what happens
16:40 - that is interesting that is interesting
16:46 - you know I think let's still have this
16:50 - actually what does happen whenever
16:54 - a core gets deleted I believe that the
16:58 - wallets would still exist
17:02 - yeah just with a null reference okay
17:08 - so let's say this
17:14 - um
17:15 - if
17:21 - okay
17:23 - okay
17:25 - so we're going to create an effect that
17:28 - says first of all check if you have
17:31 - wallets
17:36 - and how we can do that so we can just do
17:39 - the keys
17:42 - of these
17:44 - because we'll just set it equal to the
17:45 - first one by default
17:49 - how are these wallets ordered
17:56 - okay I'm going to name this wallet list
18:02 - order by
18:04 - ticker okay
18:10 - and those are wallets
18:13 - ordered wallets to
18:16 - me just look for wallet list
18:22 - so I'm going to name ordered wallets to
18:23 - wallet list
18:31 - and let me
18:34 - move this
18:37 - here
18:39 - and then what I'm also going to do is
18:42 - put a use effect here
18:46 - and then I'm going to say
18:51 - if there are no wallets
18:56 - just return don't do anything else
19:00 - now if there are
19:05 - and
19:13 - I'm just thinking and or or
19:15 - so
19:29 - manager Dot activewalletid
19:36 - and manager Dot
19:40 - activewallet tab so if they already have
19:43 - a wallet selected in a tab selected and
19:46 - just go ahead and return we don't need
19:47 - to do anything
19:52 - otherwise
19:58 - I would say
20:07 - we are going to get the first wallet
20:12 - and we are going to
20:17 - update the manager to set the active
20:19 - wallet ID to the first wallet dot ID
20:24 - and then
20:25 - we are also actually this update manager
20:28 - we can pass in multiple things right
20:31 - yeah partial okay update manager to set
20:35 - the wallet ID
20:37 - first wallet ID
20:41 - and also the active wallet tab is equal
20:45 - to wallet tab deposit
20:57 - okay and this should take care of all
21:00 - this logic
21:04 - okay now okay perfect that was good so
21:08 - log out log back in
21:10 - my wallets okay great so I already had
21:14 - one so automatically selected it in
21:17 - Redux
21:18 - and
21:20 - it led me to the deposit page now just
21:23 - to kind of check my empty State still
21:26 - working let me delete that
21:29 - log out log back in so now what should
21:33 - happen is I should see nothing here to
21:35 - deposit or retract coins create a wallet
21:37 - and now whenever I create one it should
21:39 - automatically pop that so I don't have
21:41 - to select it just like this
21:44 - go to withdraw
21:45 - comes back doesn't change it okay
21:48 - and now the last thing I want to test is
21:50 - if I have multiple wallets
21:53 - and let's say I'm on vitaxia withdraw
21:56 - now when I navigate away and come back I
21:59 - just want to make sure that it didn't
22:00 - override that and I'm still on vitaxia
22:03 - withdraw okay so that is great
22:07 - this is looking great
22:11 - beautiful okay
22:13 - so now let me just
22:21 - um
22:24 - okay
22:30 - fact is effect
22:37 - all right seeing if there's anything I
22:39 - could uh organize or improve even more
22:41 - but looks good for now so now let me run
22:45 - them into this
22:47 - and uh
22:50 - actually I can push it up but
22:55 - still got more work to do before we can
22:57 - merge it in this would just serve as
22:58 - like a checkpoint
23:02 - and this is uh what was this 28.
23:15 - actually what was my Styles changes
23:25 - my Styles what did I change
23:29 - oh yeah just that uh shade of blue okay
23:33 - so now another uh empty state
23:37 - for the course page
23:42 - so let's
23:44 - do that let's just
23:50 - this is going to delete a bunch of stuff
23:52 - do I want to do this already
23:57 - yeah why not
23:59 - all right so log back out log in and now
24:02 - gotta tackle this page Okay so
24:09 - hmm
24:14 - so I think what we can do
24:18 - this is interesting too since right now
24:21 - I have it set up where only I can add a
24:23 - core however that's kind of just to uh
24:26 - prevent spam eventually I want to have
24:28 - it where other people can add a chord to
24:32 - and I do have this button even though
24:34 - it's not going to work for anyone else
24:36 - but with all of that now I have to think
24:38 - what do we want the empty state to be
24:42 - um
24:43 - Oh either way we're going to have a
24:45 - Graphic here if there are no cores we
24:47 - know that so let's just do that already
24:50 - okay
24:52 - so this is the cores page so Source
24:57 - Pages course
25:00 - and then in the core cards
25:08 - all right so oh this is interesting too
25:11 - so we have a toolbar at the top
25:19 - and that is where the button is
25:23 - however we can replace this with our
25:25 - section heading component
25:28 - inquiry just a little out of date
25:38 - all right
25:39 - so first let's just uh get everything
25:41 - standardized
25:42 - uh this was one of the first components
25:45 - I made so that's probably why we never
25:47 - did this but either way we're going to
25:49 - replace that toolbar
25:52 - with a section heading and it's going to
25:54 - say course
25:58 - and then we also going to have a render
26:00 - button component
26:05 - gonna render return this
26:09 - return okay
26:13 - and now that we move the button to a
26:16 - section heading this toolbar
26:20 - which is the course one right yep
26:24 - all right the toolbar no longer needed
26:30 - see how we're looking
26:32 - chorus course
26:36 - now let's add some padding to this
26:43 - that's interesting as well
26:48 - that is interesting as well
26:53 - all right so for this
26:55 - oh this is what we can do actually just
26:58 - uh use that empty text
27:00 - beautiful okay
27:02 - but first of all actually let's go to my
27:04 - address pages and uh steal this
27:07 - yeah
27:09 - so on my container first of all I have
27:11 - this padding
27:14 - beautiful beautiful and then just like
27:18 - on shop my dresses we can just say no
27:20 - dresses to display
27:22 - and we're actually just use the same
27:24 - pattern
27:31 - address select model okay
27:36 - yeah we can just do this cores list
27:42 - yeah let's let's copy a lot of this
27:44 - logic okay
27:50 - so we are using memo
27:54 - and we're gonna say Coors list
27:58 - and this is going to be
28:01 - we'll just have it return this
28:12 - okay now we don't need this because
28:16 - that's replaced with that
28:19 - and then for rendering Court cards
28:25 - you can say well first of all Let's uh
28:31 - uh-huh
28:32 - yeah this is right your content right
28:34 - under Section heading
28:39 - okay
28:40 - so we're going to be rendering content
28:42 - instead of rendering course cards
28:49 - now if we do
28:55 - how did we do it here render addresses
28:57 - and then that one and your addresses
29:01 - what we can do is say something like uh
29:05 - render
29:09 - course
29:17 - and then here we can do
29:26 - core cards equals this
29:30 - and they're going to be rendered in the
29:32 - core
29:34 - cards container
29:38 - and then we can say
29:41 - if you
29:42 - have any cores then we are going to
29:45 - render those otherwise
29:49 - we're just going to say no course to
29:51 - display
29:53 - and all of that is happening right here
29:56 - under the section heading
30:04 - this is addresses
30:07 - address
30:10 - we can even rename that to cores if we
30:12 - want but
30:16 - well
30:17 - big steps
30:23 - um NLP all right so let's see what we
30:26 - got going on here all right we don't cut
30:28 - any cores it says no cores display
30:32 - beautiful
30:34 - beautiful beautiful
30:36 - okay so now let's actually add a core
30:40 - and see how our styling still looks so
30:42 - the Doom boston.net
30:44 - uh where's my logo where's my tnb logo
30:48 - logo 512 uh I'm the owner Bucky and
30:52 - ticker tnb
30:55 - now if I have a core
30:57 - all right that looks pretty good styling
30:59 - is it off a bit but
31:01 - and that is because
31:05 - in my container I have padding
31:10 - left and right and I don't think I need
31:12 - any of that
31:14 - just a grid of 12.
31:17 - yeah
31:18 - well I actually do want padding top and
31:20 - bottom
31:26 - so do padding maybe 16 zero
31:32 - actually what was it on my addresses
31:40 - let's look okay by addresses what was
31:43 - the padding on this go to
31:47 - dresses uh oh I actually just had a
31:50 - margin top of 12. that's even better
31:55 - oh yeah
31:57 - oh yeah oh this is nice and consistent
32:02 - cards container
32:04 - and IT addresses
32:06 - I don't like this name cards container
32:12 - maybe Coors container
32:16 - it's not bad though okay
32:18 - so this looks good
32:21 - and then this
32:24 - is going to be a grid with 12 so my
32:27 - cards will be laid out like that
32:29 - all right this is looking good this is
32:32 - looking good
32:34 - cool so empty state for those taken care
32:37 - of
32:43 - yeah I got into this situation too where
32:45 - if I don't have any cores
32:47 - then on this section right here you
32:49 - can't create a wallet
32:51 - because you don't have any cores however
32:54 - that's going to be uh I don't even think
32:56 - we need an empty state for that since
32:57 - that's a very rare
32:59 - situation first of all when there are no
33:01 - cores at all
33:04 - um because usually you're at least going
33:06 - to create one even if you spin up this
33:08 - exchange yourself
33:09 - then you're gonna create one before like
33:11 - inviting friends or anything
33:13 - so not really worried about any of that
33:18 - so now let me create another core
33:20 - actually before I do that let's uh
33:28 - hmm
33:30 - so this is another thing too
33:35 - empty state if you don't have any asset
33:38 - pairs
33:43 - okay
33:49 - actually let's work this one from
33:52 - uh
33:54 - kind of the backwards kind of working in
33:57 - reverse because I want to do this
33:59 - all right I'm first going to create
34:02 - the empty state which most people are
34:04 - gonna see
34:06 - and for this to happen we actually need
34:09 - two cores to create an asset pair
34:12 - since it's pretty much what coins do you
34:14 - want to trade for other coins
34:16 - so I'm going to save this and add
34:17 - another odd vitaxia
34:19 - uh let's do where's the v logo
34:24 - this one looks good I'll say I'm the
34:27 - owner of this and it's VTX
34:31 - okay now for the asset pairs basically
34:33 - what coins are tradable with each other
34:35 - say VTX can be traded for tnb and now
34:39 - the user has an option of selecting the
34:41 - S pair and then this happens
34:44 - first thing that I want to do is kind of
34:47 - do what we did with the exchange if they
34:49 - have a wallet
34:52 - which is whenever they log in as long as
34:55 - they have something then go ahead and
34:57 - select that to the active thing and also
34:59 - select the default tab for them
35:03 - also this deposits is empty right now
35:05 - which we may want to change but
35:06 - otherwise
35:08 - so right now what we do is the app has
35:12 - an asset pair
35:15 - however it's just not selected just
35:17 - because we didn't write any logic to
35:19 - select it when you don't have anything
35:21 - selected however in this situation what
35:23 - I want to do
35:25 - let me see what's going on with the
35:26 - Redux
35:29 - so what I want to do is say if you have
35:33 - an asset pair just go ahead and set that
35:37 - now all this does is it updates the
35:39 - manager the active asset pair ID
35:44 - and this tab must be in state
35:51 - okay just trying to
35:54 - get a lay of the land so order book okay
35:59 - so let's do that
36:02 - so for the exchange
36:08 - looking in the main area
36:13 - and we are looking at the trade section
36:19 - all right so we are where we want to be
36:23 - now
36:29 - this is the asset pair selector
36:37 - now here is the thing
36:41 - okay let's just set the defaults first
36:43 - and then we'll worry about everything
36:44 - else
36:46 - so what I'm gonna say off the bats is in
36:52 - our store
36:55 - we have asset pairs and given that and
36:59 - we don't have an active
37:03 - asset pair selected
37:06 - this should never be the case if you do
37:08 - have a asset pairing Redux and no active
37:10 - one just set that equal to the active
37:12 - one
37:13 - similar to
37:15 - how we did it for wallets so let's just
37:17 - get that logic first
37:19 - and to do that we can just borrow the
37:21 - logic that we just wrote from
37:24 - rows it right in here right
37:30 - but first let's get the asset pair list
37:38 - even need to do the active asset pair
37:48 - use active as a pair
37:51 - okay
37:53 - so we can indeed do it here
37:57 - so let's select those first and we can
38:00 - actually borrow from here
38:03 - so asset pairs first we need to import
38:06 - these
38:12 - and then just import everything that
38:15 - we're going to need
38:21 - and then I might as well say
38:25 - asset paired list
38:28 - using use memo
38:34 - I'm not going to need order by
38:37 - because this is just going to return
38:41 - asset pair list
38:44 - asset pairs
38:57 - all right so my asset pair list is all
39:01 - of basically my asset pairs
39:04 - and now what I can do
39:07 - is pretty much just copy this actually
39:09 - do even have dispatch in here not yet
39:14 - so we're going to need to be dispatching
39:17 - some things so let me
39:20 - get that ready
39:22 - and okay
39:32 - we're just going to borrow you to use as
39:34 - a template so we're going to have a use
39:36 - effect statement in here
39:41 - maybe potentially calling this function
39:44 - which comes from store manager
39:47 - and we're basically going to say
39:50 - if you don't have any asset pairs then
39:52 - don't even worry about this just
39:54 - you know forget it
39:58 - um
39:59 - now
40:01 - also need the import manager since we're
40:04 - going to be inspecting this part of our
40:06 - store
40:09 - all right so our store
40:11 - manager
40:17 - we can use this
40:23 - yeah let's just do this
40:30 - if you don't have any asset pairs
40:36 - and
40:41 - all right
40:43 - so if you don't have any acid pairs then
40:45 - just return and then we can say if you
40:48 - don't have
40:49 - inactive or if you already have an
40:53 - active asset pair
40:56 - then return this as well because you
40:57 - already have selected
41:00 - and then we can ensure in this to say or
41:02 - if you already have one selected then
41:04 - don't worry about it otherwise what we
41:07 - are trying to do
41:09 - is we are just going to get your first
41:14 - asset pair
41:17 - that you have
41:19 - and we are going to
41:24 - set that
41:29 - first as a pair ID
41:34 - this can be prettiered up
41:39 - I believe
41:50 - in a y oh yeah
41:55 - all right so check this out now
41:59 - what we are doing
42:04 - I wonder if I can clean this up too
42:11 - this is pretty good
42:15 - I'm just tying this up
42:27 - all right either way just want to make
42:28 - my coating consistent but here we are
42:31 - saying that
42:39 - what's going on here am I missing a yes
42:41 - one of these little thingies
42:46 - what am I missing here this goes to this
42:49 - dispatch oh it's on the next line
42:53 - embarrassing okay so if you don't have
42:58 - any acid pairs
43:00 - or
43:02 - if you already have an active acid pair
43:05 - basically I already have one selected
43:07 - then just you know don't even do
43:08 - anything just return otherwise we're
43:11 - going to get the first acid pair from
43:12 - your list and we're just going to set
43:14 - that to the active one
43:17 - so here that's good that's a good sign
43:19 - okay
43:21 - and now let me log out log back in
43:24 - and in this exchange boom boom it's
43:27 - already selected
43:30 - all right looking good and then the tabs
43:33 - for these they aren't in Redux they're
43:35 - actually in uh state
43:38 - so that all works
43:45 - now let me actually just go ahead and
43:46 - test something out by creating another
43:48 - asset pair
43:51 - um let me actually create another core
43:55 - so just say baycoin.com
43:58 - and this bacon can be the uh
44:03 - logo
44:06 - and all right so let me create another
44:08 - asset pair I just want to make sure that
44:10 - when I do create another one then it
44:13 - doesn't change some light QA
44:20 - all right so I'm logging out I'm logging
44:21 - in I don't have any active as a pair
44:24 - right now
44:26 - so when I go to
44:29 - uh exchange it should pop VTX tnb since
44:33 - that's just my first one
44:35 - now if I switch the bacon tnb then when
44:38 - I come back it should still be bacon tmb
44:41 - that's good just want to make sure it
44:43 - didn't switch to a taxi
44:45 - now that we got all that logic working
44:47 - what I want to do is kind of go back and
44:51 - just leave all my acid pairs
44:53 - and see what is the use then
44:56 - so exchange I don't have any asset pairs
44:59 - and in this case what we can do is just
45:01 - display an empty
45:05 - yeah we can just display an empty page
45:10 - since this select it doesn't even make
45:12 - sense
45:18 - so
45:20 - in this case
45:22 - what we can do
45:25 - is say
45:32 - this is going to be considered content
45:41 - mm-hmm
45:46 - okay
45:47 - so let's do this
45:50 - uh we'll say render Elemental p
45:54 - render page content
46:04 - today and I will say if
46:14 - all right so if you have asset pairs
46:18 - then what do we know we know that one is
46:22 - going to be selected
46:24 - even if you didn't do it manually
46:27 - so if you have asset pairs then just go
46:30 - ahead and return this
46:32 - as your content
46:37 - otherwise we just are going to return
46:39 - null for now
46:46 - and then this can just be render page
46:49 - content
46:53 - should be good
46:55 - at least to get us started okay
47:01 - and why is this wait do I have acid
47:05 - pairs no I don't have any
47:07 - so what's going on here
47:11 - all right I'm rendering page content and
47:13 - I'll say if you have
47:19 - what's this
47:25 - oh is this because an empty list is
47:27 - truthy I think so
47:32 - so this is true and that is because an
47:35 - empty list is truthy
47:37 - so I can say dot length
47:41 - and that is false
47:45 - and in that case let me just say
47:55 - a corset to a Boolean even though you
47:58 - can have it without these double
47:59 - ampersands I don't know
48:08 - yeah it's corset to a Boolean
48:12 - okay
48:13 - so now if I don't have any asset pair
48:16 - which I don't
48:17 - should see an empty list now whenever I
48:19 - create one
48:26 - and then actually that's not going to
48:28 - work because I only fetch them at this
48:31 - point however
48:40 - that's interesting why do I oh did I not
48:42 - save it
48:49 - log out sign in
48:53 - change
48:55 - why do I not have my asset pairs
48:58 - oh I must be fetching it
49:01 - you know what probably fetching it
49:04 - somewhere weird in my asset pair
49:06 - selector yep
49:09 - yep
49:10 - here we go
49:14 - so I'm fetching it in the component that
49:16 - doesn't get you rendered however what I
49:19 - can do
49:22 - is I confess this on app initialization
49:25 - as well
49:27 - so
49:29 - where would I do that you asked well in
49:32 - my layouts my authenticated layout
49:35 - what I can do
49:39 - is I can say get asset pairs
49:46 - just like this
49:51 - we are going to be dispatching you
50:03 - now that should take care of that log
50:06 - log in
50:07 - asset pairs are fetched
50:11 - asset pairs are in Redux now under my
50:15 - exchange since I do have one even though
50:17 - I didn't select it it is the default
50:21 - option looking good
50:24 - looking good
50:28 - okay
50:29 - now that that's working correctly
50:33 - let's go back to this case scenario
50:35 - where we don't have any asset Pairs and
50:37 - in this case what we can just do is uh
50:39 - render an empty page
50:43 - okay
50:46 - and while it's uh you have an empty page
50:49 - right here let me just steal this
50:54 - component's empty page and we'll go with
50:56 - the leaves empty States
51:01 - and this won't have any
51:04 - action text
51:09 - Okay so
51:12 - render page content if you have any
51:15 - asset pairs then you're going to render
51:17 - that otherwise you're just returning
51:19 - this no action text no action text
51:23 - it says nothing
51:25 - here
51:29 - say no
51:31 - pairs display asset pairs to this
51:39 - another thing that I just want to look
51:41 - at real quick
51:48 - okay if I put a period
51:52 - so no products to display I did not put
51:54 - a period at the end of there so when I
51:56 - say no acid pairs of display I won't put
51:58 - a period either just
51:59 - things super consistent
52:02 - okay
52:03 - so now we get the empty page element
52:06 - however
52:08 - the reason this looks weird is because
52:18 - what we're doing is we are
52:29 - okay in this container
52:33 - has a padding of 16
52:36 - let's see where the height is shrinking
52:38 - okay
52:40 - so this
52:41 - this is my empty State this must be yeah
52:44 - my empty State component
52:47 - has a height of 100 however the parent
52:51 - doesn't
52:54 - so Ken I mean I believe we can just put
52:56 - a height 100 here
52:58 - and that'll take care of that
53:01 - and I don't think it would mess up the
53:05 - active either
53:06 - I actually think that's what we want
53:13 - all right so go to exchange looks good
53:15 - nothing here no asset pairs to display
53:22 - hmm
53:26 - does this even make sense because
53:30 - I mean hopefully there is an asset pair
53:32 - all the time but I'm just thinking in
53:34 - the rare case scenario maybe I don't
53:37 - know someone's setting up this exchange
53:38 - for the first time they're gonna go
53:40 - exchange see trade but then it says
53:42 - nothing here no asset pairs to display
53:45 - and it's just kind of weird because it's
53:47 - like are there supposed to be asset
53:49 - pairs here
53:50 - uh
53:52 - but what could a better text be
53:56 - say maybe like create an asset pair
54:00 - to enable trading yeah let's go with
54:04 - that
54:10 - create an asset pair to enable Trading
54:16 - I'm a part of this up nice and parody
54:20 - okay
54:22 - nothing here create an S pair to enable
54:24 - trading orders with you in a second
54:27 - and now for asset pairs just want to
54:29 - make sure that
54:32 - when you do have one
54:39 - this thing as well
54:44 - so I believe
54:45 - actually if you log in log back in this
54:48 - should work
54:51 - even with the height now 100
54:53 - however
54:55 - in that one situation
54:59 - um
55:01 - so can we just move this hook a little
55:03 - bit
55:09 - since instead of having this Fetch and
55:12 - asset pair selector
55:15 - it doesn't seem the greatest because the
55:18 - asset pair selector is conditionally
55:20 - rendered depending on if you have asset
55:23 - pairs however you don't want to run into
55:25 - a situation where we just ran into that
55:29 - you don't have any because you aren't
55:31 - fetching them
55:32 - so instead what I'm gonna do is just
55:36 - move this
55:41 - and why is this renamed
55:49 - oh yeah you don't need to name that
55:54 - actually it may need
55:56 - that's funny
55:58 - so it didn't need renamed in this
56:00 - component but whenever we move it over
56:02 - here it is going to need to be renamed
56:07 - okay
56:10 - so dispatch get asset pairs renamed to
56:13 - underscore gas pairs
56:15 - uh it already has a dispatch
56:20 - and over here just gonna cut you
56:27 - and let's
56:31 - where are we going to fetch you how
56:33 - about here
56:38 - and display air toast
56:41 - you can display air toast to cut you
56:53 - clean you up
57:01 - foreign
57:07 - prettier prettier prettier prettier look
57:10 - file are you not pretty
57:13 - aspect selector index
57:15 - so that's for selector index and that is
57:18 - because
57:20 - deleted a semicolon
57:27 - okay
57:29 - so I have an asset pair there you go
57:32 - now the one very rare situation that we
57:36 - ran into that we can test right now
57:40 - is if they are on this page they don't
57:44 - have an asset pair okay that's fine
57:46 - refresh still don't have one but then
57:50 - one gets created on the back end I know
57:52 - this is a super Edge case but uh you
57:54 - know why not allow for it and then they
57:56 - refresh this page there should be asset
57:59 - pair at that point in time and then the
58:02 - logic of the effect
58:04 - should set it which it does beautiful
58:07 - okay
58:09 - now for the orders
58:15 - what we can do in this case is when we
58:18 - don't have any orders
58:19 - we'll display it the same as when we
58:22 - don't have any cores
58:24 - and then we can standardize our styling
58:26 - as well
58:28 - so first of all this is
58:32 - 2432
58:43 - my addresses this is
58:47 - 2432 okay
58:50 - so first of all on the orders page this
58:53 - is going to have updated padding
59:00 - the container is going to have 24 pixels
59:03 - 32
59:08 - okay
59:09 - okay now we'll get somewhere now we're
59:12 - getting somewhere number one okay
59:15 - now the orders has a correct padding now
59:18 - let's convert that to a section heading
59:19 - instead of this old school H1
59:22 - oh I remember the days we were using H1s
59:25 - but not anymore
59:30 - section heading we'll just steal it from
59:33 - Coors
59:37 - all right so now we got a fancy
59:40 - schmances section heading component
59:44 - and instead of this
59:47 - boring dumbled H1 that says orders
59:53 - we are going to use U
60:01 - okay now that takes care of that
60:05 - standardizes it puts a line underneath
60:07 - and now what we can do here
60:12 - first of all give that a margin top of
60:14 - 12.
60:16 - since that is our standard
60:20 - and that would be
60:24 - for the table
60:28 - table has a margin top of 12.
60:32 - and then
60:35 - you can stick that and render content
60:48 - so let's minimize these first
61:00 - all right so when are we rendering
61:07 - so we'll say if we do have filtered
61:09 - orders
61:16 - yeah since that's what gets mapped over
61:22 - and do we want to name this orders list
61:29 - yeah I think so
61:38 - oops what's going on here all right now
61:42 - I think I want to name this orders list
61:45 - just want to make sure I don't have any
61:47 - other naming conflicts so I'm going to
61:50 - rename filtered orders
61:52 - to orders list
62:01 - and then just reorganize these
62:04 - okay
62:07 - now in here
62:10 - what I can say is if
62:16 - basically if you have orders
62:20 - to display
62:22 - and we can display those and how do we
62:25 - do that we display the table
62:30 - so if you have orders to display then
62:33 - just return this beautiful table which
62:36 - will take care of all of that
62:39 - and this is in
62:42 - a function called render content
62:46 - now let me pretty this up
62:51 - okay
62:53 - so for render content if you have orders
62:55 - then just go ahead and display those
62:57 - otherwise
62:59 - turn null for now
63:02 - and in this case we should be returning
63:05 - null
63:06 - beautiful beautiful
63:08 - now
63:09 - thing is we don't actually want you to
63:12 - return null
63:15 - what we want you to do is the same thing
63:18 - with cores
63:21 - of course
63:24 - and that is empty text
63:34 - all right
63:36 - so empty text empty text
63:40 - return null empty text no orders to
63:44 - display
63:47 - beautiful okay so trade empty state
63:53 - actually let's look at all of our empty
63:55 - States right now
64:01 - so I'm logging out I'm going to my
64:04 - exchange I don't have any asset pairs
64:06 - yet I'm going to my orders no orders to
64:09 - display looking good
64:11 - all right so now what else do we need to
64:15 - do
64:16 - we already did it for course
64:18 - for wallets that's thinking care of
64:20 - Exchange Trade orders shop all of these
64:24 - should have empty States already yes yes
64:27 - and for sell products and orders great
64:31 - for profile those make sense to have an
64:33 - empty state
64:35 - because uh well if you're logged in
64:36 - looking at the profile you got to be
64:38 - looking at something unless you're a
64:40 - ghost
64:41 - and okay uh
64:45 - for invitations I'm just
64:48 - oh I got Bob's invitation
64:52 - but since we're on empty State let me
64:54 - delete all these invitations
65:00 - be no more invitations
65:02 - no invitations to display beautiful
65:06 - okay I think that actually takes care of
65:09 - all of our empty State logic that's
65:11 - pretty cool unless I was missing
65:13 - something but if so just let me know and
65:15 - also our apps is looking a little bit
65:17 - better because we like standardize some
65:19 - stuff like this orders header uh the
65:22 - course header I think they're all
65:24 - section headers now which is I don't
65:26 - know it's feeling like it's looking a
65:27 - little bit better at least
65:29 - so uh yeah let me go ahead and lint this
65:31 - bad boy
65:38 - and then I'll do a quick code review
65:42 - I also want to keep an eye out for this
65:44 - if I just check uh if the Boolean of any
65:48 - list because I need to remember that an
65:51 - empty list
65:53 - is uh truthy in JavaScript
65:58 - let's review
66:02 - this is good we're fetching asset pairs
66:05 - whenever the app is initialized and also
66:07 - whenever we navigate to the page as well
66:12 - and that is fine
66:14 - our components this is for the course
66:18 - page course list
66:20 - which is our new standard
66:27 - content
66:31 - cool cool
66:37 - [Music]
66:41 - margin top of 12 from that line
66:43 - standardized padding 2432
66:46 - XX component this is for our orders page
66:50 - orders let's split this out
66:54 - get ordered from the user
66:57 - ordered orders it sounds kind of funny
66:59 - okay render content
67:01 - I'm wondering if I should split this out
67:03 - to a render table function
67:09 - and that's probably good
67:11 - yeah
67:14 - give you a little unnecessary
67:17 - although we are doing it in some other
67:18 - places but
67:21 - table has a padding top
67:25 - okay
67:29 - and then this is all clean up because we
67:31 - move this get asset pairs fetch
67:34 - statement to its parent component since
67:36 - that one's conditionally rendered and
67:39 - then this one is for
67:41 - the trade section kind of where we moved
67:44 - a bunch of functionality to
67:48 - and refreshing asset pairs there just in
67:50 - case anything updated after we logged in
67:54 - and then this is pretty much setting
67:56 - your default one if you have one
68:03 - yeah this is all good
68:07 - okay
68:09 - uh we added a height to that trade
68:12 - container just to make sure that our
68:14 - empty state was
68:17 - displaying in the middle of the screen
68:19 - vertically
68:21 - this is just cleaning up some logic
68:25 - although I think I want to change that
68:28 - it's for readability
68:39 - okay
68:41 - so uh empty States I already have this
68:44 - branch
68:51 - front end
68:55 - as he States pushed about an hour ago
68:57 - okay so I'll say empty States completed
69:04 - and yeah good to go
69:07 - another ticket done
69:16 - compare this and my name a convention
69:20 - is this
69:22 - 28 Minus this and this closes 28
69:29 - pull request
69:32 - and then quickly even though we just
69:34 - reviewed this just want to make sure I
69:35 - don't have any to Do's or
69:37 - any comments
69:40 - from any previous commits
69:44 - and all that looks good
69:46 - all right time to squash and merge this
69:49 - bad boy in
69:52 - yeah that was a good uh a good
69:55 - Improvement there
69:56 - okay
69:57 - so now as usual as usual
70:04 - okay make sure I don't have any
70:05 - lingering changes and then let's shut
70:07 - this down
70:09 - and then we will just put down master
70:12 - and clean up our local environment
70:15 - so all the changes for master pull down
70:17 - we're going to delete this
70:20 - local branch
70:24 - and then we can run this bad boy
70:30 - and as long as nothing broke that should
70:33 - be good
70:35 - all right this is yeah this actually
70:38 - helps with onboarding a lot too
70:40 - since when users come in
70:43 - then they aren't going to have to
70:47 - this is another thing I'm keeping an eye
70:49 - on
70:50 - so we don't have any deposits or
70:52 - withdrawals now since we kind of just
70:54 - reset everything
70:56 - um maybe a question for you so when we
70:58 - do have deposits they're going to go in
71:00 - this section obviously the deposit
71:02 - section now would we got a couple
71:05 - options here whenever we don't have
71:07 - deposits we can one just not render this
71:10 - entire panel at all
71:13 - um
71:14 - but that may be a little bit confusing
71:16 - to the user because then they're like
71:17 - wait when I do have deposits where
71:20 - they're going to go
71:21 - now another thing that we can do is we
71:23 - can just leave it as is that's always an
71:25 - option
71:26 - it's kind of clear to me at least but I
71:29 - also developed it so I may be biased but
71:32 - what we can do is leave as is because
71:34 - it's clear that whenever you do have
71:36 - deposits they're going to go in here
71:38 - another thing that we can do is add like
71:40 - an empty State prompt to say like you
71:42 - don't have any deposits in here but once
71:44 - you do they'll appear here something a
71:46 - little bit more you know uh
71:49 - nice sounding than that but uh yeah same
71:53 - with the withdrawals right here
71:56 - but anyways I'll kind of uh leave that
71:59 - is the question for the community uh and
72:03 - on that note I think we're good for this
72:05 - video in the next one what we'll do
72:10 - actually this is uh well we kind of uh
72:15 - two birds with one stone I said defaults
72:17 - for UI using use effect
72:19 - yeah we do that as part of empty States
72:21 - so this is closed too dang two Banger
72:24 - two for one sweet okay so in the next
72:27 - video what am I going to do maybe this
72:31 - one
72:32 - right here but either way we'll uh
72:35 - decide that in the next video for now
72:37 - thanks for watching and I'll see y'all
72:38 - next time
