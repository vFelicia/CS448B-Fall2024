00:00 - hey welcome back everyone thanks for
00:01 - joining us and in this video I'm going
00:03 - to show you how to make image variations
00:05 - with the openai API so we are inside of
00:09 - the number 10 image variation folder
00:11 - inside of the open AI folder inside of
00:13 - the AI playground repository and we're
00:15 - working inside this main.py file we have
00:18 - an image the image is less than 4
00:21 - megabytes in size and it is a square
00:23 - ratio meaning the same width as the
00:25 - height so it's like 1,24 pixels by 1,24
00:28 - pixels so those are requirements of your
00:30 - input image and basically what we're
00:32 - going to do here is we're going to pipe
00:34 - an image through the openai API and it's
00:37 - going to take that image and generate a
00:39 - variation of it with AI so let's go
00:42 - ahead and toggle close the left hand
00:45 - side so we can see our code a little bit
00:47 - better and you'll notice this is a
00:48 - really simple example it's only what do
00:51 - we have here like 11 lines of code so
00:53 - the top is just the boiler plate same as
00:55 - all the other videos we got to bring in
00:56 - open Ai and we have to create a client
00:58 - now that we have our client we're we
01:00 - going to go ahead and assign a variable
01:02 - response to the resulting object from
01:04 - this API call we do the API call with
01:06 - the client. images. creatore variation
01:10 - and that is going to take a few
01:12 - arguments the first one here super
01:14 - important is the image argument we're
01:16 - going to set it equal to and then we're
01:18 - going to use Python's built-in open
01:20 - method to actually open a local file now
01:23 - if you remember we have a file bucky.
01:26 - PNG in the same folder as this main.py
01:28 - file so we just do a/ bucky. PNG inside
01:32 - of single quotes and that'll point
01:34 - directly to that file the next argument
01:36 - inside this open method is the RB that
01:39 - means read binary it just means hey
01:41 - we're not dealing with text we're
01:42 - dealing with an image images need to be
01:44 - read in bytes as binary so that we don't
01:46 - modify any of the original data for that
01:49 - image file so that's what that is it's
01:51 - just going to allow us to take that
01:53 - image and send it over to the API now
01:55 - the next thing is the N equals 1 this is
01:58 - just the variations like we had in the
02:00 - previous video we are using Dolly 2 by
02:03 - default you can't do this with Dolly 3
02:05 - at least not yet so I think you could
02:07 - potentially do more than one variation
02:09 - but for this example we're just going to
02:10 - stick with one so n equals 1 just means
02:12 - give us one variation as output to this
02:15 - API call the next thing is going to be
02:17 - the size of the output image so we're
02:19 - giving it 1,24 pixels by 1,24 pixels
02:22 - that's input so we want to go ahead and
02:23 - get the same output for our variation
02:25 - image and that's it we're going to
02:27 - Traverse down to this response object
02:29 - it's got a data property that gives us
02:31 - access to a list we're going to access
02:33 - the first element inside the list that's
02:35 - going to be an object with a property
02:37 - called URL and when we access that URL
02:39 - it's actually going to give us the URL
02:41 - to the CDN or the the hosted version of
02:44 - this generated image just like before
02:46 - these images are only available at that
02:48 - URL for a limited time I think it's like
02:50 - 1 hour so make sure that you download
02:52 - that image if you like it or you upload
02:54 - it somewhere else if you want to use it
02:56 - elsewhere on the web so we assigned the
02:58 - result of that to the image for URL
03:00 - variable and then we go ahead and print
03:02 - it to our console so python
03:05 - main.py wait for it to send us back this
03:07 - image and print out the URL and then
03:10 - we'll check it out in our
03:11 - browser and here we are so I'm going to
03:14 - control click on PC it's command click
03:16 - on Mac I believe on this URL we'll go to
03:19 - the browser over here and there's our
03:21 - variation so I I don't know if I showed
03:24 - you the original image let me go ahead
03:25 - and toggle back and show you the
03:26 - original here's the original you
03:28 - probably recognize this image the man
03:29 - the myth the legend himself Bucky
03:32 - Roberts and here's the variation
03:36 - original variation similar color of a
03:39 - t-shirt similar type of t-shirt the hat
03:41 - is on backwards in the variation
03:43 - definitely some differences but this is
03:45 - pretty cool kind of fun a little creepy
03:47 - but pretty interesting so there's all
03:50 - kinds of stuff you can do with this and
03:52 - it's only a few lines of code so
03:54 - definitely be sure and check this out
03:57 - mess around with it and let us know what
04:00 - you come up with in the comments we'd
04:01 - love to hear how you're using these
04:03 - tutorials to create projects of your own
04:05 - that's it for this video thanks a lot
04:07 - for tuning in so glad to have you all
04:09 - here and can't wait to see you in the
04:10 - next video until next time peace
