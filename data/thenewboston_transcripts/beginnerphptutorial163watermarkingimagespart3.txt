00:00 - okay so the first parameter we need to
00:03 - feed in is the image itself which we've
00:06 - created up here with the name image so
00:08 - let's just load that in first of all
00:11 - okay so the next parameter we need to
00:14 - give it is the watermark file so
00:15 - essentially what we're saying is put
00:19 - this on top of this
00:21 - so we're saying put the watermark on top
00:23 - of this image so there the first two
00:26 - parameters easy to remember the next of
00:28 - them is the obviously the position of
00:30 - the watermark so that's x and y remember
00:33 - we created our X variable here and our Y
00:35 - variable here which is minus 10 pixels
00:38 - from the bottom and the right in the
00:41 - very corner now we need the is that so
00:45 - this is the the position of the
00:50 - watermark the next is the destination
00:53 - source which not the destination source
00:54 - sorry the X&Y coordinate of the source
00:57 - point which we don't need to worry about
00:59 - in this case we can set that to zero the
01:01 - reason being is that we're starting at
01:03 - zero zero in fact earlier I said that
01:05 - zero starts from here and many apologies
01:08 - its from here okay so we're saying we're
01:11 - sort of saying zero minus ten in words
01:14 - type thing if your own oh wait I'm not
01:16 - actually sure where the corner putts
01:18 - start point anyway so zero zero for this
01:22 - bottom corner and we're going in ten
01:24 - okay so the next is the watermark width
01:27 - and the watermark height so this is very
01:29 - important obviously
01:30 - so water mark underscore width which we
01:32 - determined earlier and water mark
01:35 - underscore height which we also
01:37 - determined earlier and put into these
01:39 - variables okay so the last one is the
01:42 - opacity of the watermark now like I said
01:45 - I want this at a twenty percent opacity
01:47 - the maximum or the minimum value is zero
01:49 - for this which would render it sort of
01:53 - invisible and the maximum is a hundred
01:56 - so I'm going to set this to twenty so
01:57 - it's going to give us a nice of fading
01:59 - image okay so that's the image copy
02:02 - merge function all done it's quite
02:04 - harmful with all the parameters we need
02:06 - to give into it but now we should have
02:09 - achieved
02:09 - we won so the last function we need to
02:12 - supply is the image JPEG function and
02:14 - what this is going to do is it's going
02:16 - to actually put the image onto the page
02:20 - so remember earlier we changed our
02:22 - header file to an image JPEG now what we
02:26 - need to do is actually process this
02:28 - image onto the page so I'm just going to
02:30 - supply with the image file there which
02:33 - is what we supplied earlier and we've
02:35 - copied a watermark onto this so now
02:38 - hopefully when we supply a source file
02:41 - this should work let's just create an
02:44 - error message at the end of here just
02:46 - for purposes and our own purposes no
02:51 - source supplied so let's go into our
02:56 - browser and just go over to generate dot
02:59 - PHP on its own and we should have
03:02 - received no source supplied oh no we
03:08 - haven't obviously because we've sour our
03:09 - our content type that's just me being a
03:13 - bit stupid so okay let's um let's just
03:17 - come onto our generator PHP file okay
03:20 - now let's first supply our source in so
03:23 - I'm going to say source equals phone
03:25 - JPEG so as soon as I do this this
03:28 - the phone JPEG file will be read in by
03:30 - this the source will become phone dot
03:32 - JPEG and the rest of our code should
03:34 - process so fingers crossed that this is
03:36 - going to work okay yet so it's worked we
03:39 - have successfully merged with a 20%
03:42 - opacity our logo here on to our main
03:46 - image so let's just fill around with
03:49 - this and I'll explain for us to do a
03:51 - hundred opacity you can see that this
03:55 - has come and basically you can't see
03:58 - through it so that's something that you
04:00 - could change another thing that you
04:03 - could change you say change these values
04:04 - let's go from minus 100 and we'll see
04:07 - that our our watermark comes in words
04:10 - more so 10 is obviously 10 it's probably
04:13 - good when you could go as those two I
04:15 - guess or even zero to have it on the
04:17 - very outside of the page but 10 I just
04:20 - played around with it earlier and
04:21 - I thought was a nice whip away obviously
04:24 - you can change your watermark you are
04:29 - not limited to PNG files but I recommend
04:32 - you probably use these anyway and just
04:36 - generally have a play around I mean you
04:38 - can you can specify different settings
04:41 - things like that we we've already looked
04:43 - at what each function does and why we've
04:45 - given a variable particular value or why
04:49 - we've created specific things in
04:52 - specific places so yeah that's basically
04:56 - watermarking now what we want to do is
04:59 - this generate PHP file exists solely as
05:02 - an image so you obviously don't want to
05:04 - you know do this to show this to your
05:08 - users or anything but what you want to
05:10 - do is show this from an index index file
05:14 - now we're going to do this and then
05:16 - we're going to have a look at saving out
05:18 - our generated file as well generated
05:22 - image rather so in the source I can type
05:25 - in generate dot PHP sorry so we can
05:28 - create this PHP file inside this HTML
05:32 - element in the image element as as an
05:35 - image so even though it's a PHP file it
05:38 - now exists as an image because obviously
05:40 - we've changed our header our content
05:43 - type at the top so now we can say source
05:46 - equals phone's jpg so this is what you
05:50 - would do if you wanted to just display a
05:52 - watermark image on the fly if you like
05:56 - let's go over to index dot PHP you see
05:58 - how this is moved in now we can grab it
06:00 - we can copy it we can paste it in things
06:02 - like that however this is useful in some
06:08 - instances but if you were were to say
06:10 - let's give an example you were you were
06:13 - allowing file uploads and you are
06:15 - allowing users to upload JPEG images
06:17 - well you might want to do somewhere in
06:19 - your upload process is run this run this
06:28 - generate PHP file and you might want to
06:33 - read in the source file but then all you
06:35 - want to do is you might not want to
06:37 - output it to the screen you might want
06:39 - to save this JPEG or overwrite it
06:42 - so what we essentially do is we create a
06:44 - new file with the merge things we don't
06:47 - just want to output it to the user so
06:49 - how do we go about around here
06:51 - saving our file rather than just
06:53 - displaying it out well the solution is
06:56 - simple we don't actually need to delete
06:58 - anything or create any new functions but
07:01 - we can take take advantage of it
07:03 - additional parameters that this
07:05 - image/jpeg function allows us so let's
07:09 - just open and see what we've already got
07:12 - here we've got logo dot PNG and we've
07:14 - got phone dot PNG we don't have a
07:16 - combined version of the two these two
07:18 - both correspond to their own and their
07:20 - own rights they the logo is the logo the
07:22 - phone is the picture of the phone
07:23 - however if we just stick a comma in here
07:26 - and we specify where we want our file to
07:28 - be written to and what we want to call
07:32 - the file then we can create a new file
07:34 - from this so let's think logically about
07:36 - this if the if the name of the file is
07:39 - to be called source at the moment it's
07:41 - called phone jpg we want to name it
07:44 - something similar so source but then we
07:48 - want to append on what's phone its
07:53 - source
07:53 - jpg we could say dot watermark dot jpg
08:05 - for example so we've got will now have
08:07 - phone jpg watermark jpg or even
08:12 - underscore watermark drop jpg whatever
08:15 - it doesn't really matter you can call it
08:17 - the original file in it or I think it'll
08:19 - overwrite itself anyway so now let's
08:21 - have a look what happens when we run our
08:24 - index dot PHP oh okay
08:29 - okay maybe not let's just check inside
08:32 - our room we don't want that let's just
08:35 - check inside here okay yeah so we've got
08:38 - phone jpg dot watermark jpg let's have a
08:41 - look at that in our browser so we go
08:45 - over to phone jpg which is the original
08:49 - by the way dot watermark dot jpg okay so
08:55 - yeah it's saved it hasn't displayed out
08:57 - to us and but this is obviously again a
08:59 - perfect example of why you might not
09:01 - want to display it to your user but you
09:03 - might want to just watermark images as
09:05 - you upload them so this is a great
09:07 - function to use if you were to be doing
09:09 - something like that so you know
09:10 - uploading a file allowing your users to
09:14 - upload a file you can automatically
09:16 - create a watermark on it save it and
09:18 - then reference back to the filename in
09:20 - whatever methods you choose so this is
09:22 - basically being watermarking images with
09:25 - GD library and site PHP have a play
09:28 - around with it see what you can do
