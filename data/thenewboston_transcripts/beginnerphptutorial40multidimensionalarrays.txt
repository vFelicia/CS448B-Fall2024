00:00 - this is Alex from PHP academy' dog with
00:03 - another tutorial for the new Boston now
00:05 - in this tutorial we're going to be
00:06 - looking at multi-dimensional arrays now
00:09 - multi-dimensional arrays put really
00:11 - really put into use or into practice the
00:15 - use of arrays now as it stands we've
00:17 - created this array at the moment we have
00:20 - an associative array with different food
00:22 - types here and we've assigned values of
00:28 - the amount of calories in each food so
00:30 - we've given an example of how an
00:31 - associative array can be useful now
00:34 - we're going to move on to something
00:35 - slightly more complicated which is
00:37 - multi-dimensional arrays it sounds more
00:39 - complicated than it is but in actual
00:41 - fact the basic concept of this is an
00:44 - array inside an array and this can be
00:46 - multi-dimensional so it can be a two
00:49 - dimensional array and three dimensional
00:52 - array and so on and so forth
00:54 - and you need to really think about this
00:57 - as categories now in this example I'm
01:00 - going to be creating two categories I'm
01:03 - going to creating a category called
01:04 - healthy and unhealthy and then inside
01:08 - these different categories I'm going to
01:10 - be adding different types of food so I'm
01:12 - going to class pizzas oh sorry pizza as
01:16 - unhealthy and I'm going to be classing
01:18 - salad vegetables there vegetables
01:24 - and pasta as healthy food so this is
01:29 - basically a multi-dimensional array
01:31 - because we're going to have an element
01:33 - two elements healthy and unhealthy and
01:36 - then we're going to have more arrays and
01:38 - pizza is going to be within and around
01:40 - itself and salad vegetable and pasta is
01:43 - going to be in the right
01:44 - in fact we'll add another another
01:45 - unhealthy I'll say icecream okay so this
01:51 - is what we want to achieve so let's
01:53 - modify underneath here will comment this
01:55 - out just so it's not going to be
01:58 - taken as code okay so we've commented
02:00 - that out this is essentially what we
02:02 - want okay so this is the this is the top
02:06 - array so let's delete everything we've
02:09 - got inside the first thing we're going
02:10 - to do is create two elements to our
02:13 - array the first one is healthy the
02:16 - second one is unhealthy okay so now what
02:20 - we want to do is we're creating
02:21 - essentially an associative array because
02:24 - I want to add a value to this and a
02:27 - value to this like we did in the
02:28 - associative arrays tutorial but now
02:31 - instead of assigning a value you may
02:33 - think oh yeah I'm going to start to
02:35 - assign salad as healthy and then blah
02:38 - blah blah it's going to get all mixed up
02:40 - so what we do is we take it into another
02:42 - dimension and we say we're assigning the
02:46 - value so we have created an array inside
02:51 - an array so we're already talking into a
02:54 - second dimension so if I add another
02:57 - array in here let's just run this to
03:00 - prove that is going to work ok yes we're
03:03 - not receiving any errors at all now
03:05 - inside these arrays we can start to add
03:07 - our our foods so let's add salad
03:19 - vegetables' pasta and then in unhealthy
03:25 - let's add pizza and ice cream okay so
03:34 - now we've essentially created a
03:35 - multi-dimensional array what we can do
03:37 - is we can bring this down to make here
03:41 - sort of look a look a bit better so pull
03:45 - this down to here it's a bit tricky with
03:49 - this text editor that I'm using but you
03:51 - get the general idea of how we can how
03:55 - we can make it you know look a bit a bit
03:58 - more easy to read if you like so let's
04:01 - get rid of this here just so a bit
04:04 - neater okay so let's run this and to
04:07 - make sure everything's working
04:08 - yep we've not received any errors so now
04:10 - how are we going to access each element
04:12 - of this array so what we've essentially
04:14 - done is we've created an associative
04:17 - array with the value of the of the
04:19 - associative healthy and unhealthy as an
04:22 - array so we've created a
04:22 - multi-dimensional array so how are we
04:24 - going to access these different elements
04:26 - or we can echo out food again remember
04:30 - we're using our square brackets and then
04:32 - we address healthy but then what we do
04:37 - is we need to access either element of
04:40 - either room key 0 1 or 2 so what how do
04:46 - we do this you know we need to add
04:48 - something around here to two out be able
04:50 - to access that all we do is we put
04:52 - another pair of square brackets next to
04:54 - it and then we type the element so as
04:57 - this stands we're accessing the array
05:00 - food the key of healthy here and then
05:05 - inside that the first key which is salad
05:08 - so we're essentially here echoing out
05:11 - salad now you can already see how this
05:13 - is to start starting to pull together
05:15 - into a database type structure so let's
05:18 - just refresh and see if that works
05:19 - we're echoing salad now we can change
05:21 - this to make so perhaps two that's going
05:25 - to echo out pasta and let's refresh
05:28 - pasta okay so we can obviously change
05:32 - this to unhealthy and access element 1
05:36 - which would be ice cream so you can see
05:38 - how we can do this and change it and you
05:40 - can see now how it's got multiple
05:42 - dimensions to this array so that is
05:45 - basically an and a multi-dimensional
05:49 - array in PHP and how we declare it and
05:52 - also how we access each each element
