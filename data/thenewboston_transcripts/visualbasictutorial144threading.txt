00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:04 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this this tutorial we're going to be
00:08 - talking about threads now every
00:11 - application you make runs on what's
00:13 - called a thread now sometimes you have
00:15 - to make more than one thread to run
00:18 - certain parts of your application so if
00:20 - you
00:21 - remember from using multiple forms as
00:24 - objects if you open up your main form
00:28 - and that's loaded and then you click a
00:29 - button in opens up a second form if you
00:31 - close out of your main main form it's
00:33 - going to end the thread that the
00:34 - application is on and the entire thing
00:37 - is going to close all of your windows
00:38 - are going to close now what you can do
00:41 - is you can put each one of those windows
00:43 - on a different
00:44 - thread and that will make it so that the
00:47 - application will not close um if you
00:49 - close the main form that is uh on the
00:53 - thread the main thread for your
00:55 - application now uh you don't have to
00:58 - create the thread yourself
01:00 - um it's already made on one thread when
01:02 - you create an application but you can
01:04 - add on more if you want so let's go
01:06 - ahead and make a project and do a little
01:08 - demo application to show what threads
01:10 - can
01:17 - do so let's go ahead and select a
01:20 - Windows forms application and we will
01:22 - call it threads
01:32 - okay so now that our app has loaded
01:34 - let's go ahead and resize the form sum
01:36 - and add some
01:47 - controls so we'll come over here to our
01:50 - toolbox and we will add a button and we
01:53 - will set the name of the button
01:56 - to or we'll set the text to start new
02:02 - thread and we will set the name to
02:06 - button
02:08 - thread okay so let's double click on
02:10 - this to open the event handler for it
02:13 - we'll get rid of form one load because
02:14 - we don't need that so we'll just zoom in
02:17 - some
02:19 - here okay
02:21 - so let's go ahead and create a thread up
02:24 - here so we'll start off by declaring it
02:26 - private
02:33 - so we'll have
02:35 - private my
02:37 - thread
02:39 - as
02:40 - system. threading do thread now you can
02:45 - also import system. threading so that
02:48 - you don't have to type this out every
02:49 - single time you want to create a new
02:52 - thread so now let's go down here and we
02:56 - will create we will say my thread equals
03:00 - new
03:02 - thread
03:03 - and or
03:05 - new system. threading do
03:09 - thread and we need an address so we will
03:12 - just type address of it says creates a
03:16 - delegate delegate procedure instance
03:18 - that references the specified procedure
03:20 - so basically what we're going to do is
03:21 - we're going to tell it um what to run on
03:24 - that thread so let's go ahead and create
03:26 - that so we'll do private sub
03:30 - show
03:32 - message and we'll
03:34 - do
03:36 - um message box.
03:39 - show I am on
03:46 - thread and then we'll just do my
03:50 - thread and now what we need to do is we
03:52 - need to sleep that thread because if we
03:54 - didn't oh no we don't because it's
03:56 - showing a message box the thread will um
03:59 - automatically
04:00 - be destroyed once we click okay so we're
04:03 - going to do address
04:06 - of show
04:09 - message okay so we created the thread we
04:12 - set it equal to a new thread with the
04:14 - address of the sub show message so now
04:18 - what we can do is we can come down
04:21 - here and we can type my thread. start
04:30 - and what this will do is it'll start our
04:31 - thread and as soon as we click okay it
04:34 - won't have anything else to do so that
04:36 - thread will close so let's go ahead and
04:39 - start
04:53 - debugging okay so here is our form one
04:56 - right here so let's go ahead and click
04:59 - Start new thread and you can see that it
05:01 - says I am on thread my thread now I'll
05:05 - just show you um in the task manager
05:18 - here looks like it wasn't showing up in
05:20 - the task manager but what this does is
05:23 - when we start the new thread it opens up
05:26 - a new thread right here and if we close
05:28 - out of that you can see that this
05:30 - message box is now running on a new
05:32 - thread and it will continue running um
05:35 - without the need for form one to be open
05:38 - so I'll just go ahead and click okay and
05:39 - close out of
05:40 - that so threads are kind of a hard um
05:45 - concept to grasp so go ahead um create
05:48 - some thread threads like this um just do
05:51 - them with an address of a sub or a
05:53 - function and later on we'll be getting
05:55 - into more advanced uh types of threading
05:59 - but but for now just practice this and
06:01 - then once you got that down go ahead and
06:02 - move on to the next tutorial
