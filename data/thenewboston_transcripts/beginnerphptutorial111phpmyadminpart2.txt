00:00 - now storing a different type of data is
00:02 - almost like storing a variable with a
00:04 - different type of data and you can see
00:06 - that we've got a really extensive list
00:08 - of data inside here now through the
00:11 - tutorials that I'm going to be taking
00:13 - you through we're not going to be
00:14 - focusing on lots of different types of
00:15 - data but there for you to play around
00:17 - with and match them to your suitability
00:20 - when you go on and develop further
00:22 - applications now the ID remember is a
00:26 - number that auto increments to give each
00:28 - row a unique value and you'll see how
00:31 - that works in a moment if you don't
00:32 - quite understand it yeah so what I'm
00:34 - going to do is I'm going to choose this
00:35 - as a type int because it's an integer
00:38 - you can also have things like tiny int
00:41 - small and medium and big in so they're
00:43 - all different types of numeric data
00:46 - values decimal float double as well so
00:49 - I'm going to choose int for this you can
00:51 - even choose something like small int or
00:54 - medium in however if you expect say a
00:58 - hundred users on your website this is
01:00 - fine
01:01 - however if you're going to be taking
01:03 - into the millions then you're going to
01:04 - need to stick with int okay so lengths
01:07 - values we don't need to worry about
01:08 - default we don't need to worry about in
01:10 - this case because ID is going to be
01:12 - incrementing the two we need to focus on
01:14 - in this case are the index now remember
01:17 - I said the primary keys is the field or
01:20 - the column that's you the unique column
01:24 - so we have specified unique column this
01:26 - is the unique number color and now we
01:29 - can tick auto increment and this allows
01:32 - us to every time we create a record we
01:34 - are incrementing this value so we'll
01:37 - start at 0 by default and then when you
01:40 - create a record you'll have value 1 & 2
01:43 - then 3 so you'll never have this will
01:45 - never equal 0 so let's come a little to
01:48 - username and password now obviously we
01:50 - don't want to store user name or
01:52 - password is just int but what we do want
01:55 - is varchar' the vital span stands for
01:58 - variable character so what we can do
02:01 - here is we must specify a length and a
02:04 - value whereas in here oh let's just get
02:06 - rid of that whereas in here we didn't so
02:09 - a username would typically be say no
02:11 - more than 30 characters
02:13 - so we can specify this as 30 password
02:16 - exactly the same it might be it might be
02:18 - less than 30 characters but this is
02:20 - something you're going to have to
02:21 - specify in your program let's say you
02:23 - were to create a user or user login
02:25 - system you'd have to say you know give a
02:27 - max length to your text field and check
02:30 - inside PHP if the password specified are
02:32 - the usernames specified weren't bigger
02:34 - than 30 because anything bigger than 30
02:37 - attempting to be written into this table
02:39 - is going to be cut off if we were to
02:42 - create a password that was 32 characters
02:45 - it would end up getting rid of the last
02:47 - two characters and we'd just end up with
02:50 - 30 so there's nothing else we need to
02:52 - set for the username and password in
02:54 - this case we can set default values but
02:56 - because we already want these always
02:58 - want these to be specified there's no
02:59 - need
03:00 - default just means you can specify a
03:02 - default value if this isn't if no data
03:05 - is specified to be written so for
03:08 - example we could create a field on the
03:10 - end here called stay logged in and this
03:13 - might be equal to 1 or 0 depending on
03:16 - whether the user want to be logged in
03:18 - but by default it might be 0 if that
03:20 - makes sense so now what we do is we come
03:22 - down and we click Save now what you can
03:26 - see is that we've created now a table
03:29 - here called users and we've got a number
03:32 - 1 in here to show that we've got one
03:33 - table so let's click back on this table
03:36 - so we can have a look inside and you see
03:39 - we've got the information are outlined
03:42 - here for us in a table you can see that
03:44 - ideas underlined which means it's a
03:46 - primary key and we've got our type here
03:48 - so you can see int is a map is a length
03:52 - of 11 so a length of it 11 digits of
03:54 - integer data this might be considered a
03:57 - bit too much but like I said if you were
03:59 - going to go into say millions of users
04:00 - this is what you specify otherwise you
04:02 - could have something smaller
04:04 - you've got a varchar 30 and we didn't
04:07 - change the password I've just noticed
04:09 - we've kept this as an int so this is a
04:12 - good time to show how we're going to
04:14 - edit some of our values you can check
04:17 - each value that you want to edit and
04:19 - perform an operation underneath here so
04:21 - for example at the moment I just want to
04:23 - edit password and I'm going to click on
04:25 - this change thing here so
04:27 - or pencil so now it's giving me just
04:30 - this password on its own where I can
04:32 - change the type of it to varchar' and I
04:35 - can come down and I can click Save okay
04:39 - so that's safe know that you can see
04:40 - it's updated that we've got everything
04:42 - in here
04:44 - oh you can also individually edit each
04:48 - one so you can see that we've got extra
04:51 - here we've got auto increment now how do
04:53 - we go about inserting some data into
04:56 - this table because at the moment we've
04:58 - got the table but we've got no data now
05:01 - this would usually be done for PHP if
05:03 - you were say registering users you'd be
05:05 - inserting this data from PHP once the
05:07 - form has been checked for example you'd
05:09 - certainly use them a password however we
05:12 - can do it manually from PHP myadmin if
05:15 - we wish to do so so I'm going to click
05:17 - on insert and I'm going to scroll along
05:20 - a bit an ID we can leave blank because
05:23 - remember this is an also incremented
05:25 - field we can specify it being left blank
05:28 - and it will automatically update for us
05:29 - we've got user name and password so
05:32 - let's enter a user name and let's enter
05:35 - a password what we can also do is
05:37 - specify the amount of rows we want to
05:39 - insert so we can say restart in citation
05:42 - with 40 rows for example but for now I'm
05:44 - just going to insert the data Alex and
05:47 - password and I'm just going to click go
