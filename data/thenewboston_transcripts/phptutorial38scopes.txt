00:00 - what's up everyone welcome back to your
00:02 - 38th PHP tutorial and in this tutorial
00:05 - we're gonna stick with the
00:07 - object-oriented PHP aspects of
00:09 - programming and we're gonna be covering
00:12 - something called scopes now this was in
00:15 - the last story or you know those
00:17 - keywords that set public private and you
00:20 - know that stuff that popped up and blue
00:22 - that we really didn't know what it meant
00:24 - well in this story I'm gonna cover the
00:27 - pretty much the introduction of what
00:30 - scopes are and why you need them in why
00:33 - they are useful so anyways let's go
00:35 - ahead and create a variable like we did
00:37 - before actually the first thing we need
00:39 - to do is make a class let's go ahead and
00:41 - make a class call it tuna or something
00:43 - like that if you watch my job sorro's I
00:45 - pretty much named every single class
00:47 - tuna so hey might as well stick to it so
00:50 - let's go ahead and make two different
00:53 - kinds of variables one of them will be
00:55 - public and just named us you know like
00:57 - fish one and I will name this fish
01:01 - stinky
01:03 - pretty good name for a fish and make
01:06 - another variable book type the keyword
01:09 - private before this one and just go
01:11 - ahead and name this variable like fish -
01:13 - and I shall name you and something
01:17 - different than stinky I shall name you
01:19 - smelly goody cuz he smells good
01:22 - all right now check this out at the very
01:26 - basics of scope another word for scope
01:30 - is pretty much where can you use this
01:33 - variable so the two main ones I want to
01:37 - go over in this tutorial are public and
01:39 - private there are a couple of or other
01:43 - ones and those are both I won't even
01:46 - tell you guys what those are right now
01:47 - but for now just know that there's two
01:49 - different types of variables that you
01:51 - can use a public variable and a private
01:54 - variable a public variable means you can
01:59 - use this variable anywhere you can use
02:01 - it in this class you can use it in this
02:04 - program you can use it anywhere in your
02:07 - entire program now check this out
02:10 - whenever you put private before a
02:12 - variable this
02:13 - that you are only allowed to use it in
02:16 - this class right here if you try using
02:19 - this variable out here it's not gonna
02:21 - work so private means that you know it's
02:24 - like a this class is private club and
02:27 - only these variables are invited but
02:29 - public means that it's public to your
02:32 - entire program pretty much um it's a
02:35 - little different than that but anyways
02:36 - let me show you guys an example and
02:38 - maybe you'll understand a little bit
02:40 - better what this means so anyways let's
02:42 - go ahead in our body where we can
02:44 - actually echo things out and see them
02:45 - and go ahead and create an object I'll
02:47 - name it my object oops
02:50 - so you can clearly see what's going on
02:52 - and again in order to create a new
02:55 - object put new since we're creating a
02:58 - new type the name of your class which
03:00 - mine was tuna and we don't put anything
03:03 - in the parenthesis for now now let's
03:06 - just go ahead and echo out both of these
03:09 - variables and see what happens again
03:11 - like I said this one should echo find my
03:13 - object which means we're using the toon
03:15 - class and let's go ahead and echo out
03:18 - the variable fish one and remember this
03:22 - is the public one and like I told you
03:24 - you can use public variables anywhere so
03:27 - we're good right here so this should
03:28 - echo out the word stinky as long as I
03:31 - didn't have any typos or anything like
03:32 - that now let's go ahead and copy this
03:35 - because I'm lazy to type it and let's go
03:38 - ahead and try to echo out the variable
03:40 - fish too
03:41 - but check this out since fish 2 is
03:43 - private that means that we're only
03:46 - allowed to use it in this class right
03:49 - here we're not supposed to be using a
03:50 - way out here in the rest of our program
03:53 - this fish to named smelly good he's only
03:56 - a private member of this class so let's
03:59 - go ahead and save it say you know F PHP
04:01 - rules we don't care we're gonna try to
04:03 - use that anyways so let's go ahead and
04:05 - refresh this that i refresh it I hope so
04:07 - move it over again I'm not using lamp or
04:10 - amp or damp or anything like that so
04:13 - let's go ahead check this out here's
04:15 - what we get we got stinky echoed out
04:18 - just fine since it's public no problems
04:20 - there but then we tried to echo out this
04:22 - other variable that was private and we
04:24 - got a whole bunch fatal air can
04:26 - axis oh my god I think the FBI is gonna
04:29 - come and chew me in the head for trying
04:30 - to do that anyways here's what happens
04:32 - when you try to use private variables
04:35 - outside of your class it just doesn't
04:38 - work you get a bunch of death threats
04:39 - from your browser and it's just not a
04:42 - good result so anyways you saying all
04:44 - right so I understand the use of
04:48 - actually I'm going to do this and a
04:49 - little bit of this and little bow to
04:51 - column a little bit of column B all
04:53 - right so anyways you're saying all right
04:55 - why wouldn't you just use public
04:57 - variables everywhere then it just seems
05:00 - like it would be easier and said again
05:01 - airs and aside from that why would you
05:04 - ever want to use a private variable well
05:08 - these are questions that I'm going to
05:11 - answer in Sorrells to come pretty much
05:13 - it's just a safer way to program and
05:16 - when you're doing dad validation you
05:18 - pretty much always know I don't want to
05:21 - say always for the most part you
05:22 - typically want to use private variables
05:25 - so we're saying all right then how can I
05:29 - have a way to access or pretty much to
05:33 - output this name in my program because
05:35 - if we have a variable like that and we
05:37 - can't even use it it's no use
05:39 - well in order actually all right I think
05:43 - I got time to cover in this story in
05:45 - order to let's say you have a private
05:48 - variable and you want to echo it out
05:49 - what you need to do is you need to build
05:52 - a function that is public and since this
05:56 - function has access to this variable
05:58 - let's let me go ahead and build this and
06:00 - I'll show you guys what I'm talked about
06:01 - remember anything public can be used
06:04 - outside of this class aka in our program
06:07 - so go ahead and write public function
06:10 - but you have to speller write function
06:13 - and we're just say my name but I
06:17 - won't say my grandma will get mad
06:19 - at me alright anyways now what we need
06:22 - to do is the only thing this function is
06:24 - going to do is echo the variable so
06:26 - remember anytime we use a variable
06:28 - inside the same class use the keyword
06:30 - this which means I'm using stuff from
06:32 - this class now put your little arrow to
06:35 - fish - now check this out
06:38 - since
06:40 - this function is inside this class and
06:43 - this variable can be used anywhere
06:45 - inside this class this is actually valid
06:48 - if this function was out here it would
06:51 - be invalid and give you an error but
06:52 - since this function is inside this class
06:55 - it can use any variable want public
06:57 - private doesn't matter so it's a it's
06:59 - kind of like a way of tricking PHP in
07:02 - since we can't use this variable
07:04 - directly outside of class we need to
07:06 - make a public function which does have
07:09 - access to this variable and then we can
07:11 - call this function from outside our
07:13 - class and it'll work just fine so let's
07:16 - go ahead and since this is a fatal error
07:19 - we need to comment it out because fatal
07:22 - is gonna crash your program and now what
07:25 - we want to do is actually model type
07:27 - this out my object which pretty much
07:30 - means something from that thun class and
07:33 - use the function say my name so let me
07:38 - explain this before I actually run it
07:39 - what this is gonna do is first it's
07:42 - gonna output was his name it's stinky
07:44 - right there and then it's gonna say all
07:46 - right in the tune the class do whatever
07:49 - is in the function say my name so it's
07:51 - gonna go up here make sure it's public
07:54 - which it is and it's gonna say all right
07:56 - what do you want to do I want to echo a
07:58 - variable from this class named fish to
08:01 - so it's gonna echo stinky and smelly
08:04 - goody let's put a space right there so
08:06 - it looks a little bit neater so anyways
08:08 - let's go ahead and save that and run
08:10 - this bad boy let me do this a little bit
08:12 - of this a little bit of that and let's
08:15 - see what we get stinky smelly goody how
08:18 - beautiful is that so anyways the point
08:20 - I'm trying to get across in this
08:22 - tutorial is you can only use private
08:27 - functions and private variables inside
08:30 - the class where you created them but if
08:33 - you make something public you can pretty
08:35 - much use it anywhere and again I didn't
08:38 - really show you how this is useful in
08:40 - this is oral but in the upcoming
08:41 - tutorials I'll show you guys why this is
08:43 - a better way to do things sometimes and
08:45 - how it's going to make your life
08:47 - programming a whole lot easier so for
08:50 - now just understand the concept that
08:52 - and in the soils to come you will see
08:55 - why this is actually useful so anyways
08:57 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
08:59 - subscribe and uh I don't know I have
09:02 - like a minute left to tell you guys what
09:03 - to do
09:04 - send me some Christmas presents in the
09:06 - mail oh if you would bake me a cake that
09:09 - would be great and anyways just check
09:11 - out my websites and I'll see you guys
09:12 - later
