00:00 - what is up guys is Bucky and welcome to
00:02 - a quick update video I haven't made a
00:04 - video in a while so I thought hey it's
00:06 - probably a good idea to make a video so
00:08 - the first thing I want to say is happy
00:11 - Valentine's Day to everyone I hope your
00:14 - Valentine's Day is going awesome I don't
00:16 - - so happy Valentine's Day the second
00:19 - thing I want to mention is you guys ever
00:21 - get this crusty lotion at the tip of
00:24 - your lotion bottle because I do and it's
00:27 - kind of grossing me out and I don't want
00:29 - to touch it so I'm just kidding that's
00:32 - not really what I wanted to talk to you
00:34 - guys about this video what I want to
00:37 - talk to you guys about is a quick little
00:39 - update on my channel and that is the
00:40 - fact that the new Boston has finally hit
00:43 - a hundred thousand subscribers so thank
00:46 - all of you guys who have ever viewed
00:49 - rated or most importantly subscribed my
00:52 - channel
00:53 - without you guys none of this would be
00:55 - possible so from the bottom of my heart
00:57 - I thank you and for you guys who were
00:59 - just watching this video because you
01:01 - clicked on it because you thought I was
01:03 - child above common mistake but what the
01:05 - new busting is is it basically started
01:08 - out as a hobby a couple years ago I
01:10 - started making videos on how to make a
01:13 - website and then a lot of people started
01:16 - watching it and they started asking me
01:17 - for other tutorials like computer
01:20 - programming so I made some other
01:22 - tutorials and more people viewed it and
01:25 - more people started joining the
01:27 - community and now it kind of developed
01:29 - into this huge community of computer
01:32 - programmers and people interested in
01:35 - computer related topics and it kind of
01:37 - just exploded recently and I mean to be
01:42 - honest people from different countries
01:44 - are messaging me every day asking me
01:46 - about computer related stuff I've had
01:48 - strangers come up to me in public asking
01:51 - me about the channel I've had
01:53 - universities email me asking me to speak
01:57 - at their college radios are what they
02:00 - call radio stations are calling me
02:02 - asking me for interviews and it's not
02:05 - only overwhelming but it's kind of
02:07 - exciting at the same time so I'm
02:09 - definitely looking for more than
02:12 - to the future of the new Boston can't
02:14 - wait to see what's in store for it so
02:16 - backing up a little bit whenever I saw
02:19 - that the new Boston was gonna hit
02:21 - 100,000 subscribers it made me realize
02:24 - the potential that we have is a
02:26 - community Inn as a channel not only are
02:29 - my goal is to you know get as many
02:32 - people as I can to watch my videos but
02:34 - it kind of made me notice that I'm
02:37 - starting to give it education people not
02:40 - only who have no time to you know enroll
02:43 - in the college course but maybe they
02:46 - can't afford the textbooks and you know
02:48 - people are beginning to get an education
02:51 - superior to what you would get out of
02:53 - college without ever having to spend a
02:55 - single dime on any materials the only
02:58 - thing you need is access to a computer
03:01 - and the willingness to learn so this is
03:04 - probably the thing that I'm most proud
03:06 - of beyond everything else and to be
03:09 - honest to let this thought just kind of
03:11 - pass me by wouldn't only be selfish of
03:14 - me but it would be kind of idiotic
03:16 - because I mean I'm just now beginning to
03:20 - realize just the huge potential and the
03:23 - huge impact that I can have on education
03:26 - as a whole to kind of be the leader in
03:29 - free education and hopefully you know I
03:33 - can become one of the largest
03:35 - Institute's
03:36 - you know bigger than any University
03:38 - bigger than any organization in I want
03:42 - to do this and I want to keep giving
03:44 - away my tutorials for free and I said
03:48 - that because in the past few weeks you
03:50 - guys have noticed that I haven't been
03:51 - making a lot of tutorials and there's a
03:53 - very good reason for this I've been
03:56 - doing a couple things I don't want to
03:57 - spoil it but all this month in February
04:01 - I'm gonna be doing a couple things
04:03 - setting up for March and again like I
04:06 - said I don't want to give you guys too
04:08 - many details but in March they're gonna
04:11 - be some huge changes to the new Boston
04:14 - all for the better it's gonna be
04:16 - basically an education revolution if you
04:19 - thought the New Boston was awesome
04:21 - before just wait till you see what's in
04:23 - store for March so anyways
04:25 - I think I'm gonna leave you guys at that
04:27 - but definitely just sit tight I'm not
04:31 - gonna be making a lot of tutorials for
04:33 - like the next two weeks but I am gonna
04:35 - be working my butt off and just hold on
04:38 - sit tight it's definitely gonna be worth
04:40 - it you guys just wait so like I said
04:44 - before we finally did a hundred and
04:46 - can't wait to see what's in in store for
04:49 - the future ticking me off the dumb
04:53 - screensaver so thank you guys so much um
04:56 - I can't express my gratitude enough so
04:59 - again thank you guys so much
05:01 - sit tight and uh I'll see you guys later
