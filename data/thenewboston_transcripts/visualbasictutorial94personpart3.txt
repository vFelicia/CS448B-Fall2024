00:00 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:05 - this tutorial we're going to be working
00:07 - on the person application now you can
00:09 - see here that I've made a couple changes
00:12 - to this application I added a list box
00:15 - called list people which will store uh
00:18 - instances of the person object so that
00:21 - we can add a whole bunch of people to
00:22 - our program and I added a button called
00:25 - new person and I just rearranged the
00:26 - buttons over here uh on the right side
00:29 - and the name property for new person is
00:32 - button add
00:34 - person so what I also did is I added an
00:38 - update all sub which just calls all
00:40 - three update income update weight and
00:43 - update
00:44 - money so now what we need to do is we
00:48 - need to come down here and we need to
00:50 - create an array list to store all of our
00:53 - people so we'll do this by typing
00:58 - private my people people as new array
01:03 - list so this is what we're going to use
01:06 - to store all of the people that are
01:08 - created so now what we need to do is add
01:11 - a method that will um add people to the
01:15 - array list so we'll just go ahead and
01:19 - come down
01:20 - here and we will
01:23 - type private sub add person and we will
01:28 - just add uh by valal the name so
01:32 - whenever a new person is created they're
01:34 - going to have to supply us with the name
01:36 - so byal name as
01:39 - string or let's just do p
01:43 - name and we'll go ahead and enter and
01:45 - it'll fill all of this in for us the in
01:47 - sub and what I also did is over here in
01:50 - the person class just go ahead and
01:52 - create a public variable called name
01:55 - make it of type string and set it equal
01:57 - to
01:58 - nothing okay so now what we're going to
02:02 - do is we're going to come back here in
02:03 - form
02:04 - 1vb and whenever they add the person
02:07 - we're going to
02:08 - decare um my new
02:12 - person as new person so now that we've
02:16 - created a new person we need to set some
02:19 - of the um values for it or one of the
02:23 - values so it we'll type my new
02:28 - personname equals P
02:34 - name okay so now that we have
02:36 - initialized the name that's all we need
02:39 - because all the other values are
02:41 - defaulted um assuming that the person
02:44 - like has just been born or something
02:46 - similar to that uh so now what we need
02:48 - to do is we need to add that c uh add
02:51 - that uh person to the array list so
02:55 - we'll type my new person or no we need
02:59 - to type my people. ADD and we will add
03:04 - my new
03:06 - person okay so now that we have our add
03:10 - person sub created it declares a new
03:13 - person it sets their name and then it
03:14 - adds that person to the my people array
03:17 - list so I'll come in here and double
03:19 - click on new person and you can see it
03:21 - creates this button add person uh click
03:24 - event so now what we need to do is we
03:28 - need to go ahead and type type input box
03:32 - so this will open up a box and prompt
03:34 - the user to input a value so we just go
03:37 - ahead and
03:39 - type uh the prompted string so please
03:43 - enter a name for your
03:48 - person and then we'll go ahead and set
03:50 - the title as name and we'll set the
03:53 - default response to John
03:56 - Doe okay so now that we have created our
03:59 - input box we're going to need to store
04:01 - what they got in a variable so we'll
04:04 - declare name as string and we'll set it
04:07 - equal to whatever the input input Box
04:10 - gives back to it so now we need to
04:13 - create a
04:14 - person
04:16 - so add
04:19 - person and we'll go ahead and type name
04:23 - right there as the arguments so whatever
04:25 - they type in the input box it's going to
04:28 - uh set the name value for the new person
04:30 - and it's going to add them to the array
04:32 - list now what we need to do is we need
04:35 - to add that person to a to the list box
04:40 - so we'll just type list people. items.
04:45 - add and we'll just go ahead and add
04:50 - um my
04:58 - people
05:08 - so now what we need to do is add that
05:10 - person to our list box so come back up
05:13 - here to
05:14 - our add person sub and we'll go ahead
05:18 - and type list
05:20 - people. items. add and we'll just add my
05:24 - new
05:26 - person. name so it's going to add the
05:29 - name uh of the person so let's go ahead
05:32 - and run
05:34 - this and
05:36 - we'll bring it down here if it'll stop
05:40 - resizing and we'll go ahead and click
05:42 - new person so now we need to enter a
05:44 - name for our person so I'll just go
05:46 - ahead and uh enter Sam and then click
05:50 - okay and you can see it adds Sam to our
05:52 - list box so go ahead type this code in
05:56 - uh if you don't understand what it is
05:57 - you can leave a question uh in the
05:59 - comments and I'll try to respond to that
06:01 - and uh make the changes that I showed to
06:04 - you at the beginning and um maybe even
06:06 - uh Go On by yourself without looking at
06:09 - the next tutorial see if you can learn
06:10 - on your own um but if not uh stay tuned
06:14 - for the next tutorial where we are going
06:15 - to be working more on this application
06:18 - and how to access the people the
06:20 - different people that we have stored in
06:21 - our list box so thanks for watching
