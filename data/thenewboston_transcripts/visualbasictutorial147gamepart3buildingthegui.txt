00:00 - hello YouTube say I'm here from
00:02 - youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
00:04 - new Boston and in this tutorial we're
00:06 - gonna be continue continuing working on
00:08 - the game now you can see here that we've
00:11 - created our dragon our villain our
00:13 - zombie and our enemy class so let's go
00:17 - ahead we'll come up here to file and we
00:20 - will add a new project so let's go ahead
00:23 - and save this
00:24 - let's save the project as game go ahead
00:30 - and save that okay so now it opens up
00:36 - our add new project dialog so what we
00:39 - want to do is create a windows form
00:41 - application and we will call it the game
00:43 - - UI for graphical user interface if you
00:48 - didn't already know that so we'll just
00:49 - wait for that to load you can see here
00:51 - in our solution we've got our game
00:54 - library and our game DUI so one thing
01:02 - that I wanted to change from the last
01:05 - tutorials is our ArrayList so instead
01:09 - not our ArrayList our race so instead of
01:11 - making them private let's create them
01:13 - public and read-only so that the user
01:17 - can access them but they can't change
01:19 - anything about them so let's go through
01:23 - here public read-only
01:37 - okay so now that we've done that let's
01:40 - go ahead and create a little rough draft
01:43 - for our game so we'll come over here to
01:47 - our tool box and let's add some picture
01:51 - boxes so this picture box is going to
01:54 - hold your character or popeye let's go
01:59 - ahead and size the image so we'll
02:02 - stretch the image to fit in there now it
02:05 - will make another one and we'll just put
02:07 - it over here
02:08 - so we'll set the name of this one to
02:14 - picture Popeye and then this one to
02:22 - picture enemy so now let's go ahead and
02:28 - we'll add a button so the button will
02:34 - say or we'll set the name to button
02:39 - attack is gonna say attack on it now we
02:48 - won't be able to do anything with the
02:50 - villains because they're going to attack
02:52 - on their own and we're gonna be creating
02:54 - a timer that will pause their attacks
02:56 - for a second or two in between the time
02:59 - that we attack so that it does not
03:01 - automatically attack as soon as you're
03:03 - done as soon as your characters done
03:06 - attacking so now that we've got that
03:08 - let's go ahead and add some progress
03:12 - bars so that we can monitor the health
03:15 - of our of Popeye and our enemy so we'll
03:21 - just bring this down some I will press
03:24 - ctrl C to copy it
03:29 - and we'll make another one so we'll set
03:33 - this one to progress bar Popeye or and
03:41 - then we'll set this one to progress bar
03:44 - enemy okay so this is just a rough
03:51 - outline of what our program is going to
03:54 - look like so let's go over here to the
03:56 - picture properties of the Popeye and
04:00 - let's go ahead and set the picture so
04:03 - we'll go ahead and import a local
04:06 - resource we'll go to desktop and here we
04:10 - have Popeye go ahead and open that and
04:14 - click okay
04:16 - so here's Popeye right here let's go
04:20 - ahead and make him a little bit skinnier
04:22 - there okay so this is always going to be
04:26 - the same now let's add a button and
04:30 - it'll say spawn enemy so we'll set the
04:35 - name to button spawn and then we will
04:40 - set the text to spawn enemy now we will
04:48 - be making several changes to this
04:50 - throughout the program and the reason
04:52 - I'm doing this is because I'm going to
04:53 - show you what it's like to develop your
04:55 - own programs that you make changes
04:57 - throughout it and that you're not going
04:59 - to just come up with your best ideas at
05:00 - first so whenever we spawn the enemy
05:03 - what its gonna do is going to generate a
05:05 - random number and then pick from a
05:07 - series of pictures to put in here so
05:10 - what we need to do is come over here to
05:11 - game GOI and we'll go ahead and open up
05:15 - the properties of it and we can come
05:18 - over here to resources and we can add
05:20 - some resources so let's add an image so
05:25 - we will add let's say a JPEG I don't
05:29 - let's add an existing file sorry about
05:32 - that so we'll come over here to the
