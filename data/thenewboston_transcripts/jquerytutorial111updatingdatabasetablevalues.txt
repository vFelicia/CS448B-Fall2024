00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new bustin
00:06 - in this example application we're going
00:08 - to take a look at updating database
00:11 - table values with jQuery and we're going
00:14 - to be using the same methods that we've
00:16 - used with Ajax but in this application
00:18 - we're gonna make it a little easier for
00:20 - you to update multiple fields at one
00:24 - time and I'm going to show you and take
00:25 - you through how you would do this now
00:28 - the one thing I have not done in this
00:29 - tutorial is created some kind of PHP
00:33 - code that will actually retrieve the
00:35 - initial values from our database now
00:38 - let's take a look first of all at the
00:41 - table that we're going to be using I've
00:43 - created a database called jQuery and I
00:46 - have a table called users just in here
00:48 - and we have first of all a user ID which
00:52 - is extremely important because if you
00:54 - are updating users values they will
00:57 - always have a unique ID and this is
00:59 - where you will use or your where clause
01:02 - in your MySQL query in order to update
01:06 - it so for example at the name at the
01:09 - moment the name here is Alex just go
01:12 - ahead and browse and refresh that so we
01:14 - can see so that's Alex this form here
01:18 - and I've given it a just a simple header
01:20 - to make it look a bit more user friendly
01:21 - it's called name now assuming you've
01:24 - created a some code that will actually
01:26 - take the value from here based on the
01:29 - user ID it will input the field data
01:33 - here so Alex would be written in here so
01:36 - that's the first thing that you would
01:38 - have to go ahead and do yourself you'd
01:41 - probably have some kind of system in
01:42 - place if you are updating values to
01:45 - actually retrieve the initial value
01:47 - first however if I were to go ahead and
01:50 - modify this for example add a surname
01:52 - and then click Save you can see that
01:56 - we've now got this your settings have
01:58 - been updated now just before that there
02:01 - was a tiny flicker of a loading message
02:05 - that came up so if you were to say
02:08 - update you know if the user was updating
02:11 - a long
02:11 - a string of data raw or several fields
02:14 - at a time with lots of data in you would
02:17 - have a loading sign come up beforehand
02:20 - and I'll demonstrate this a bit later
02:21 - when we actually create this by using
02:24 - the sleep function in PHP to actually
02:27 - pause the script however we have this
02:30 - confirmation message your settings have
02:32 - been updated let's go back to our table
02:34 - and click browse and you can see that
02:37 - where my name was originally Alex we now
02:40 - have a surname added in as well
02:43 - so this form here has actually updated
02:46 - this value here and that's based on a
02:49 - user ID that I've sort of forced to be
02:52 - set so you'll see you'll see that a bit
02:54 - later on anyway okay so essentially what
02:58 - this is doing is actually just updating
03:01 - the database table value based on the
03:04 - fields that we're going to be adding in
03:06 - here we're just going to be using the
03:07 - name field in this tutorial however
03:09 - obviously once you've completed the
03:11 - tutorial and you're comfortable with it
03:13 - you can go ahead and update multiple
03:15 - fields at a time okay so to begin let's
03:19 - first of all take a look at the files
03:21 - that we're going to be using in this
03:23 - tutorial now the first file is Ajax
03:26 - jeaious if you've looked at my other
03:29 - example applications in this series
03:31 - you'll note that we include this in the
03:33 - page as well as jQuery so we have use of
03:35 - this javascript file all this javascript
03:39 - file is going to do is it's going to
03:40 - take the fields that we've created all
03:43 - the button that we've created and it's
03:45 - actually going to handle this event and
03:47 - you know perform the ajax or the post
03:51 - HTTP request in jQuery settings is the
03:56 - file that we're calling from Ajax in
03:59 - order to actually go ahead and update
04:01 - these values here this value here and
04:04 - init dot PHP is going to start our
04:07 - sessions in PHP so we're going to start
04:09 - the ability to use sessions we're going
04:12 - to set a current session to one the
04:14 - value one remember that corresponds to
04:17 - this here so essentially what we're
04:18 - doing is we're forcing a session to
04:20 - equal one and this is just for the
04:23 - purposes of the tutorial however you'll
04:25 - probably
04:25 - have some kind of registration and login
04:27 - system in place if you don't you can
04:30 - follow along by forcing this value
04:32 - otherwise you can use the session data
04:35 - that you've already already have in
04:37 - place on your website the third thing
04:40 - that this is is going to do is connect
04:42 - our data connect to a MySQL sit there
04:45 - server and then select the jQuery
04:49 - database so the first thing we want to
04:52 - do is go ahead and build the front end
04:54 - of this and this is the page where we
04:56 - have the form field and the button to
04:58 - update so I'm first of all going to
05:00 - create a h3 tag and I'm just gonna give
05:03 - this a name of settings or title of
05:05 - settings I'm then gonna go ahead and
05:08 - create the name label and as well as
05:12 - that the input field as well let's just
05:16 - around these in paragraph tags the idea
05:20 - of this is going to just be name and we
05:23 - also need a button a bit further down so
05:29 - the type is button the value is going to
05:32 - be save and the ID is going to be save
05:39 - underscore button now we also need a
05:42 - span as well which is going to handle
05:44 - the information that's fed back so we
05:48 - need a span element and the idea of this
05:52 - is going to be save underscore status so
05:55 - this will either show the loading text
05:58 - which we're going to talk about a bit
05:59 - later it's either going to show
06:01 - successfully updated or could not update
06:03 - your settings for example if the query
06:06 - fails for any reason
