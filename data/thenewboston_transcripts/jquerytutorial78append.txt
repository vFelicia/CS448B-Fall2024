00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' talked
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:04 - in this video we're going to look at
00:06 - some manipulation of element and we're
00:09 - going to be looking in particular with
00:11 - the append function now we're going to
00:14 - go ahead first of all we're simply going
00:16 - to create a small script that's going to
00:20 - append in a particular string of text or
00:24 - HTML string to a particular element so
00:29 - let's go ahead and create a paragraph
00:31 - and give this an ID I'm going to call
00:34 - this area and then up here I'm going to
00:38 - create a button so an input type button
00:41 - with the value append and we'll give
00:47 - this an ID as well so we can reference
00:49 - it when we catch the event I'm just
00:52 - going to call this a button okay so
00:54 - essentially what we want to happen is
00:56 - when we click on this button we want to
00:57 - append something to this area now this
01:00 - is obviously different to the HTML and
01:02 - the text functionality in jQuery where
01:05 - we actually append as opposed to replace
01:07 - the contents now towards the end of the
01:10 - tutorial we're going to take a look at
01:12 - appending to several different elements
01:15 - at once as well so this is just
01:17 - appending to this one element P this
01:20 - paragraph tag which is called area so
01:23 - before we do anything else let's go
01:24 - ahead and create a new file which is
01:26 - going to be our JavaScript file I'm
01:28 - going to call this append j/s I'm then
01:32 - going to go ahead and include it into my
01:33 - page so by typing out our script tags
01:40 - and this is text forward slash
01:44 - JavaScript and we obviously need to
01:46 - include the source which is Jay s /a
01:49 - pend j s so everything is now set up and
01:52 - we can go over to appendage a s and
01:54 - start to work on this now the main thing
01:57 - that we want to do is catch the click of
01:59 - this button using an event handler and
02:01 - then append something to this paragraph
02:03 - the contents of this paragraph in here
02:05 - so let's go ahead and first of all setup
02:07 - the event handler we're going to say
02:10 - button we're referencing with the hash
02:12 - box that's the ID of this button and
02:14 - then we're going to say dot click inside
02:17 - of here we need to create a function and
02:20 - then we come down and inside here we can
02:23 - start to append so every time we click
02:26 - on this button we want to append some
02:27 - text to this paragraph or the contents
02:30 - of this paragraph so we reference the
02:33 - paragraph as area and we just simply use
02:36 - dot append and then in here we can type
02:39 - in something we want to append so I'm
02:41 - going to choose just one and then a
02:44 - space afterwards so every time we click
02:47 - this button this action will be
02:49 - performed and it will append a one and a
02:51 - space onto the end so now that we're now
02:54 - browser let's just go and refresh the
02:56 - page now when I click append you can see
02:59 - that one has appeared inside of this
03:01 - paragraph now when I click it again you
03:03 - can see that the same thing happens and
03:05 - we have another one and we can just keep
03:07 - doing this and it will keep appending
03:09 - this value to this paragraph now what we
03:13 - can also do is we can reference this and
03:16 - actually generally add to an element so
03:20 - for example if I was to get rid of this
03:22 - P here and I was to create two or three
03:27 - of these down the page we could say
03:29 - perhaps give them the class of para just
03:34 - go ahead and copy that down there
03:38 - and we'll give this class a different
03:40 - name so we'll call it last so these are
03:43 - the first two paragraphs and this is the
03:44 - last one what we can then do inside
03:46 - appendage is is change this accordingly
03:49 - so we reference a class instead of the
03:52 - ID of the element so I'm just going to
03:55 - choose para now what's going to happen
03:57 - is we're going to append a one on to
04:00 - this paragraph and this paragraph
04:01 - however not this last paragraph so let's
04:04 - just take a look so I'm going to click
04:06 - append and you can see that we've got
04:08 - the first paragraph here the second
04:10 - paragraph here and the last paragraph
04:11 - which is called last these two have been
04:13 - called to append this value and
04:15 - therefore they both have the values
04:17 - appended each time we press the button
04:20 - okay so now that we've completed this
04:23 - example let's take a look at a slightly
04:25 - more interactive probably not useful but
04:29 - an interactive example the first thing
04:32 - I'm going to do is create an input field
04:34 - and this is going to be type text I'm
04:36 - going to give this an ID of name and
04:41 - then I'm going to create a button next
04:42 - to it and this is going to be called
04:45 - well this is a type button and the value
04:48 - of this is just let's say submit ok so
04:52 - inside here I want to create an ID
04:55 - attribute and I'm going to call this
04:57 - button and now what we want to happen is
05:01 - we want a sentence to be appended to so
05:04 - for example in this paragraph here which
05:06 - I'm going to call sentence I'm going to
05:09 - say your name is and I'm going to leave
05:12 - this part blank now what we can actually
05:14 - do is because there's already text
05:16 - inside of this paragraph when we use
05:18 - append we're just going to append a name
05:20 - onto the end of here
05:21 - so whatever the user types in here and
05:24 - then when they click the button it will
05:25 - append it onto the end so we've left a
05:27 - space just in here ok so let's go ahead
05:30 - and change this around so we've got
05:33 - button click we have the same event
05:36 - handler present we now just need to get
05:38 - rid of this we're going to create a new
05:40 - variable called name and we're going to
05:41 - make this equal to the value of our text
05:45 - field here which is called
05:47 - so hash named dot Val okay so now what
05:53 - we want to do is we want to append this
05:54 - name onto the end of this sentence so
05:58 - let's go ahead and reference the
06:02 - sentence div or paragraph sorry and then
06:06 - we want to say append name okay so now
06:11 - let's return to our browser when I go
06:13 - ahead and type my name in here and click
06:15 - Submit you can see that that appended on
06:18 - to the end of that string so it's
06:21 - extremely useful in this in with regard
06:24 - to if you wanted to build up data on a
06:26 - particular line if you wanted your user
06:29 - to build up specific data one example I
06:32 - can think of is if you were to create a
06:34 - calculator and you wanted a string of
06:36 - text to show the operation that is
06:38 - currently in progress so for example if
06:41 - there was a button on the page saying -
06:43 - and a button saying 3 and a plus symbol
06:46 - you could say 2 plus 3 and you might
06:49 - want to just build up a string of the
06:50 - operation that the user is carrying out
06:52 - there's there's loads of cases that
06:55 - you'll probably come across to actually
06:57 - use the append functionality in jQuery
07:00 - however this is just a basic example to
07:03 - get you started
