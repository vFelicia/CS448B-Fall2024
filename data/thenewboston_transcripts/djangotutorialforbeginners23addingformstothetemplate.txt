00:00 - alright guys so now what we need to do
00:01 - is first things first actually make the
00:04 - form so the user has you know something
00:06 - to click on so in my detailed view I'm
00:09 - actually just going to go ahead and get
00:10 - rid of all this because I'm not going to
00:14 - make this a list item anymore I'm
00:16 - actually going to make them form inputs
00:17 - so I'll keep this all the same all this
00:20 - red Taylor Swift and then the logo I
00:22 - think that'll be you know pretty cool to
00:24 - have so so before we even have the form
00:27 - section what you should always do is you
00:29 - should include a section for an error
00:31 - message so an error message is going to
00:34 - pop up whenever the user tries to do
00:37 - something that isn't valid like maybe
00:39 - you were having them sign up for your
00:40 - webpage and they forgot to input a
00:42 - username or maybe they tried to make a
00:45 - password that was only two characters
00:46 - long so you would want to put a little
00:48 - prompt at the top of the form Beck hey
00:50 - you need to actually you know make a
00:52 - password that's at least like eight
00:54 - characters or something so it's actually
00:57 - really simple to do go ahead and make an
01:00 - if and you can actually name this
01:02 - variable anything you want but I'm just
01:05 - going to say if error message because
01:07 - later on whenever you're handling this
01:09 - form usually we're just going to want to
01:12 - say okay do something to that base
01:14 - redirect them to this page no problem
01:16 - but if something bad does happen then we
01:21 - can redirect in to this page and then
01:23 - we're going to actually store an error
01:26 - message in here in this variable and
01:28 - we'll set it equal to like hey use a
01:31 - longer password or you know whatever we
01:34 - want to tell them so just make a
01:36 - conditional right in there and you can
01:38 - style this however you want I'm just
01:40 - going to make something bold real quick
01:41 - so strong and I'll just say error
01:45 - message
01:49 - so hopefully this will not exist there
01:53 - won't be any error messages and this
01:54 - will not even appear but if it does then
01:58 - they're going to have a little bold
01:59 - message at the top says hey you did
02:01 - something wrong alright so now we want
02:07 - to end if all right so that's all we
02:11 - need to do and later on whenever I set
02:13 - this you guys are going to easily see
02:16 - what I'm talking about let me clean this
02:17 - some like being able to scroll for some
02:20 - reason you feel so free alright so now
02:23 - we just need to go ahead and make a form
02:25 - and all right let's build this step by
02:29 - step so what is the action of the form
02:31 - the action is what URL you want to send
02:37 - this data to and of course we just want
02:39 - to send it to this right here
02:42 - but remember instead of just hard coding
02:44 - this we have that cool shortcut so back
02:48 - in here all right let me just copy this
02:53 - because I'm too lazy to type it out and
02:56 - all right so the action for this is
02:59 - music favorite so that's the URL pattern
03:03 - we can go ahead and pass in the album ID
03:05 - as well because we also need to pass in
03:08 - the song ID but for the song ID we're
03:11 - going to be getting it from these inputs
03:15 - so there you go now another thing
03:19 - another attribute that we want to add is
03:22 - the method so the method of this is
03:24 - going to be post most of your forms of
03:27 - course are going to be post I assume
03:28 - that you guys already know about getting
03:30 - posts so there you go now one other
03:33 - thing that's kind of weird with Django
03:34 - is it always is a good idea to have a
03:38 - CSRF token and I'm going to talk to you
03:41 - guys about um security and the best
03:44 - security practices with Django in a
03:45 - whole nother tutorial but if you guys
03:48 - just want to look at it a little bit
03:49 - look up cross-site request forgery and
03:52 - it's pretty cool topic so CSRF token and
03:57 - usually whenever you're making websites
03:59 - this is a pain in the butt to add but
04:02 - the
04:02 - thing about Django is whenever you want
04:04 - to use it in Django you just add that in
04:07 - Django takes care of everything behind
04:09 - the scenes pretty cool all right so we
04:12 - have a form right there so now what we
04:14 - on do is we want to list through this
04:16 - album and just loop through every song
04:19 - and make that choice and we already do
04:21 - that before so remember that was for
04:25 - song and album dot song set dot all you
04:33 - let me just go ahead and end my four and
04:36 - four alright so we're going to loop
04:39 - through all of the songs and for each
04:42 - one what we want to do when we need two
04:44 - things an input button and that's going
04:46 - to be the radio button that they click
04:48 - and also a label and label is just going
04:50 - to be the title of each song so the user
04:53 - knows what the heck option you're
04:55 - selecting so let's go ahead and do our
04:57 - input first so again I'm just using a
05:01 - radio button you can use a checkbox if
05:03 - you want but whatever so of course the
05:05 - type of this equals radio now the ID is
05:10 - pretty much just for your HTML so for
05:14 - the first one it's just going to be song
05:15 - one and then song - and then song three
05:17 - so we really don't use it in code but
05:19 - whenever we have labels we pretty much
05:22 - give it the same ID so that way it knows
05:24 - that this input or this radio button is
05:27 - for that label so you guys are going to
05:29 - see later on whenever we run the final
05:32 - site but there you go
05:32 - so I'm just going to write song and then
05:36 - for loop counter so again this is going
05:40 - to get Auto incremented each time it
05:43 - prints out a song so 1 2 3 4 5 and
05:47 - that's already built in we don't have to
05:48 - do anything weird with that now after
05:51 - this just set name equal to song and
05:53 - value equal to song ID so let me scroll
05:59 - so you guys can see so again later on
06:02 - whenever we actually pass this data all
06:05 - of the form data to the views function
06:08 - so we can actually handle it this is
06:10 - going to be the name or just the
06:12 - variables name and then this is going to
06:14 - be the song ID
06:16 - so will pretty much say get the ID of
06:18 - whatever song they selected let's say
06:22 - that this one was 20 and then it's going
06:23 - to look through the debt base and then
06:25 - do its thing
06:26 - alright holy crap what's going on here I
06:32 - have my font way bumped up for you know
06:35 - just so I can so just so it looks better
06:37 - on YouTube and it's kind of hard
06:40 - whenever I'm program and I never program
06:42 - with my font this big so that's why it's
06:44 - that kind of freaking me out all right
06:46 - so now let's just go ahead and make a
06:47 - nice little pretty label for the user so
06:51 - for the label the first thing you write
06:53 - is this four and this attribute is the
06:56 - exact same is this
06:59 - so for song one song to yadda yadda
07:02 - whatever so again this is mostly just
07:05 - for display and what do we want to
07:09 - display in the label well let me just go
07:12 - ahead and display the song title I
07:14 - really don't care about the file type I
07:17 - don't think the user is going to care
07:18 - about that either so I'll just write
07:20 - song dot song title now another thing
07:27 - that I'm going to do is this how does
07:29 - the user know that their song is
07:30 - favorited well I'm going to go ahead and
07:33 - find some star icon online and we'll say
07:36 - that if a particular song is favorited
07:39 - then right where this is on the
07:41 - right-hand side just go ahead and plot
07:43 - that star logo so whatever favorites
07:45 - they have it's going to have a nice
07:46 - yellow star right next to it so how do
07:49 - we add that logic well it's pretty
07:51 - simple actually you can go ahead and
07:53 - copy this
07:57 - alright so delete this and instead of
08:00 - checking for if error message we can say
08:03 - if song is favorite so if the song is
08:10 - the favorite then what do we want to
08:12 - happen let me just pause the video and
08:14 - find some image all right so I actually
08:17 - just made one real quick alright so if
08:20 - this song is their favorite then what
08:22 - we're going to do is we're just going to
08:24 - plop up this image and I'll show you
08:28 - guys what this is
08:31 - know if you guys can even see that oh
08:34 - it's only a little star so that's why it
08:36 - looks all fuzzy sixteen by sixteen but
08:39 - this is gonna appear right next to the
08:41 - song looking good all right may looking
08:45 - sweet and actually after this label I'm
08:49 - going to add a line break in that way
08:51 - every song is going to appear on a new
08:53 - line so they do right now because there
08:56 - are list items and they do that by
08:57 - default but to ensure that it does that
09:00 - with form labels just going to add that
09:03 - line break now the last thing that we
09:05 - need to do is we actually need to add a
09:07 - submit button because if we just run it
09:10 - right now then it's just going to be a
09:11 - bunch of radio button options in the
09:14 - user can select one but they can't
09:15 - submit it so I'll just say input they
09:19 - bump this in so input the type equals
09:23 - submit and the value and the value is
09:30 - just what text you want to appear on the
09:32 - button I'll just say favorite that has
09:34 - no effect on your program whatsoever so
09:36 - there you go
