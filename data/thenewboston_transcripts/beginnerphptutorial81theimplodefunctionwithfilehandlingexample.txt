00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP Academy and
00:03 - this is another tutorial for the New
00:05 - Boston now in this example I'm going to
00:07 - be showing you uh something we did in
00:09 - the previous tutorial we exploded data
00:12 - so we took data uh from this file just
00:15 - here names.txt that was comma delimited
00:18 - so we had commas in the middle of each
00:19 - piece of data and we um read it in and
00:22 - took away the commas and displayed it
00:24 - line by line uh rendering it basically
00:27 - so we can do anything with each name now
00:29 - suppose I have an array like this one
00:31 - and I've got three names in my array and
00:33 - I want to add commas in between um this
00:37 - data so as it stands it's in Array
00:40 - format we um can access uh each element
00:44 - of the array by saying um names array
00:47 - and putting in the uh key of the array
00:49 - so here what would happen was we' we' uh
00:53 - output Alex now I'm going to do
00:56 - completely what I did with completely
00:58 - opposites what I did with the explode
01:00 - and I'm going to use implode so I'm
01:02 - going to create a string and I'm going
01:03 - to call this uh variable string and I'm
01:06 - going to say implode and give it the
01:09 - same um comma that I did before and in
01:13 - fact a space then what I'm going to do
01:16 - is I'm going to give it the value names
01:19 - array now what we've actually done here
01:22 - straight away is we've we've taken away
01:25 - the array we've taken away the array and
01:28 - we've created a string so now if I just
01:31 - Echo out string you can
01:34 - see that
01:36 - um we've created um a string from this
01:40 - so if I was reading in that data with
01:42 - the commas and I wanted to then say
01:45 - maybe output some updated data I need
01:48 - some way of taking that array putting
01:50 - commas back into it so I can pop it back
01:52 - into the file so now what we can do is
01:55 - after this uh do our usual file open
01:58 - business uh just down here open up the
02:01 - file write to the file um or appen to
02:06 - the file so we can we can you can use
02:08 - the previous tutorials to achieve this
02:10 - so it's simply achieved by the implode
02:13 - and obviously you're not limited to what
02:16 - you can put in here you could implode
02:18 - using let's say hyphens so if we come
02:21 - down here uh we'll get rid of this and
02:23 - we could Echo out string for example now
02:26 - if I was to refresh you can see that
02:28 - hyphens have been put in between the
02:30 - data so this isn't just used for file
02:32 - handling it can be used for a variety
02:34 - different uses if you're trying to get
02:36 - an array and you want to create some
02:38 - string data out of that and you want to
02:40 - use a little delimiter in here um such
02:42 - as a comma or a forward slash maybe even
02:46 - tabs or spaces you can pop them in there
02:49 - and that will implode that few so if you
02:51 - think about exploding and imploding it's
02:52 - the complete
02:54 - opposite
