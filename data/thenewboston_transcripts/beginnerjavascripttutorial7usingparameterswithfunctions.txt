00:00 - what is up everyone welcome to your
00:02 - seventh JavaScript tutorial and in this
00:04 - tutorial I'm going to be talking more
00:06 - about functions and specifically what
00:09 - those parentheses are and why you need
00:11 - them whenever you create a function well
00:13 - let's go ahead and first create a
00:15 - function and let's go ahead and name it
00:17 - meall why not and then go ahead and add
00:20 - your parentheses now let's go ahead and
00:23 - make the body right now before we start
00:24 - talking about the parenthesis um let's
00:26 - just go ahead and make an alert box
00:29 - we'll just leave empty for now so now
00:32 - what we need to do is talk about this
00:35 - parenthesis these parentheses are called
00:38 - the parameter of our function now
00:41 - sometimes you need additional
00:43 - information in order for your function
00:45 - to work for example if you made a
00:48 - function to convert the temperature of
00:50 - Fahrenheit to calculus you would need a
00:53 - temperature in order to know what number
00:55 - to convert if you made a function in
00:58 - order to you know greet someone like
01:01 - hello Bucky hello Tina hello Tom you
01:04 - would need their name in order to know
01:06 - how to greet them so let's go ahead and
01:09 - make a function with a parameter now in
01:13 - order to make a parameter just go ahead
01:15 - and type in the name of a variable like
01:18 - X or something like that and then later
01:20 - on whenever you're creating the body you
01:23 - go ahead and you use that X just like
01:25 - you would a normal variable so for
01:27 - example I love
01:30 - and then go ahead and write X so now
01:33 - whenever we use this function we need
01:37 - instead of let me go ahead and just uh
01:39 - type something like
01:41 - meatball and then we need to pass in a
01:45 - value and let's just say bacon or
01:48 - something like that so now here is
01:50 - what's going to happen let me run this
01:52 - for you maybe that'll be
01:54 - easier oh it's off the screen let me uh
01:57 - run it on the screen run
02:00 - Chrome there you go right here I love
02:03 - bacon okay so why did it say I love
02:06 - bacon and what exactly is going on well
02:09 - you see we called our function and used
02:11 - it right here but since this function
02:14 - has a parameter it says all right in
02:17 - order to use this function I need one
02:19 - extra piece of information so whatever
02:22 - information we gave it right here it
02:25 - actually took this word bacon and it
02:27 - said X now equals bacon so now in the
02:31 - body of my function whenever I come
02:34 - across the variable X I substitute it
02:36 - with whatever you gave me which is bacon
02:39 - so let's go ahead and call this again uh
02:44 - with um what else do I love Natalie
02:49 - Portman
02:50 - and um the movie good willll hunting so
02:55 - now let's go ahead and save this and run
02:57 - it and maybe this will be easier to see
02:59 - it says I I love bacon first and then
03:01 - you press okay and then it says I love
03:04 - Natalie Portman press okay and then it
03:07 - says I love Goodwill Hunting press okay
03:10 - so now you can see that it's the same
03:12 - function it just has different
03:14 - information being passed into it and by
03:16 - the way I keep saying past because the
03:19 - technical term whenever you give
03:21 - additional information into a function
03:23 - it's called passing it information into
03:26 - its parameters so this the parentheses
03:29 - are technically called its parameters
03:31 - and when we give information into it
03:34 - it's called passing information but
03:36 - anyways you can say substituting
03:38 - variables it really doesn't matter as
03:40 - long as your program works so anyways
03:42 - you could see that whenever we gave
03:44 - extra information it said I love and
03:47 - then it substituted that information as
03:49 - X so it says I love bacon I love Natalie
03:53 - Portman I love Goodwill Hunting so that
03:57 - is how you can use parameters whenever
03:59 - you
04:00 - you know want to use additional
04:02 - information for your function so this is
04:04 - a really simple example using an alert
04:06 - box um yeah that's pretty much all I
04:09 - have for you for this tutorial in the
04:11 - next tutorial I'm going to show you what
04:13 - happens if your function needs more than
04:15 - just one piece of information maybe it
04:17 - needs three names instead of just one
04:19 - maybe it needs a couple numbers instead
04:21 - of just one so anyways that's what I'm
04:23 - going to be showing you guys how to do
04:24 - it's called passing multiple parameters
04:28 - into a function and it can can get kind
04:30 - of complex but as long as you stick with
04:32 - me then you'll be okay so anyways thank
04:34 - you guys for watching this tutorial and
04:35 - I'll see you next time
