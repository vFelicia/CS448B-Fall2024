00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:02 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:04 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:06 - talking about open file dialogs
00:09 - now open file dialogues are used to of
00:12 - course open files and they are built
00:13 - into Visual Basic so you know you do not
00:15 - have to create your own form for it and
00:17 - you can just add an object of it to your
00:20 - program and use it whenever you need to
00:22 - so we'll create a new project we will
00:26 - select windows forms application and we
00:28 - will call it open files go ahead and
00:32 - click OK and wait for that to load and
00:35 - once it's done loading we'll go ahead
00:38 - and shrink this a little bit and we need
00:40 - to add three things we need to add a
00:43 - button we will set the text to open and
00:48 - we will set the name of it to button
00:53 - open and we'll add a label so here is
00:57 - our label and we will set the name to
01:00 - label file and we'll go ahead and set
01:02 - the initial text value to no file
01:06 - selected okay so now we need to come
01:11 - back in our tool box will minimize out
01:12 - of common controls containers menus and
01:16 - toolbars data components and now we need
01:18 - to come down here let me just get some
01:20 - of these out of the way we need to use
01:22 - dialogues now select an Open File dialog
01:25 - you do not have to drag this on your
01:27 - form you can just go ahead and double
01:28 - click on that and it adds an object of
01:31 - it to your form to your project I mean
01:34 - so let's double click on open and let's
01:39 - go ahead and zoom in here so what we
01:41 - want to do when they click open is type
01:43 - Open File dialog one dot show dialog so
01:50 - this is going to show a dialog that will
01:52 - allow them to select a file now we want
01:55 - to do is we want to set the label to
01:58 - whatever the name of that file is so
02:00 - label file dot text is going to be equal
02:03 - to Open File dialog or Open File dialog
02:08 - one dot file name
02:12 - so let's go ahead and run this you can
02:17 - see here you can see here we got a form
02:19 - one I want to click when we click open
02:21 - it opens a file open file dialog for us
02:26 - so let's go ahead and navigate here and
02:29 - let's select back check five so we'll go
02:33 - ahead and open that sorry that was out
02:36 - of frame there but we'll select
02:37 - backtrack five which is a Linux
02:39 - distribution well click OK we'll click
02:43 - open and you can see that it gets the
02:46 - full path of our file now we can open
02:50 - another one let's go to development
02:52 - c-sharp projects signs calculator and
02:54 - we'll select the solution file and you
02:57 - can see that it's going to give us the
02:59 - entire path of that file so we can use
03:01 - this path later on to open the file or
03:04 - maybe read text from it or what else we
03:07 - whatever else we need to do now what we
03:11 - can also do is change some properties
03:13 - and values of our open file dialog
03:16 - before it is shown so we'll just type
03:18 - open file dialog one dot title and we
03:22 - can set it to whatever we want so I can
03:25 - even set it to on live gamer so let's go
03:28 - ahead and run this and see what kind of
03:29 - results we get it says no files selected
03:33 - so we'll go ahead and just open one you
03:36 - can see here that the title says on live
03:38 - gamer now you can change the title to
03:40 - whatever you want and it will also
03:42 - change the icon to whatever your
03:44 - programs default icon is and so we'll
03:49 - just select some here click open and you
03:52 - can see that it gives us the path of
03:54 - that file so we'll go ahead and close
03:58 - out of that so practice a little bit
04:00 - with Open File dialogues later on we're
04:03 - going to be learning more about save
04:05 - file dialogues folder browser dialogues
04:08 - font dialogues print dialogues there's a
04:10 - whole bunch of stuff built into Visual
04:11 - Basic that makes it easy for you to open
04:15 - files print stuff whatever you need to
04:17 - do without having to waste time coding
04:19 - for that and you can focus on what your
04:21 - program is really supposed to do so like
04:24 - I said practice
04:25 - this is a little bit I've changed some
04:27 - attributes of your open file dialog then
04:29 - once you've got that down go ahead and
04:31 - move on to the next tutorial
