00:00 - we're going to start with a little
00:02 - review of inequalities and then we're
00:05 - going to learn how to solve and graph
00:07 - inequalities so I don't know how many of
00:09 - you have ever seen an inequality before
00:14 - but the chances are you have so this
00:16 - symbol right
00:20 - here is the less than symbol and it's
00:23 - saying that whatever that's this is both
00:26 - of these
00:28 - signs are like equals but instead of
00:32 - saying that this is equal to this
00:35 - they're going to say that either this is
00:38 - less than blank or this is greater than
00:40 - blank so when your little point is
00:45 - facing that
00:47 - way it means that this is less than this
00:54 - and that this is greater than this
01:03 - so now that we know that I'm going to
01:06 - show you what a basic inequality looks
01:09 - like where s is greater than
01:13 - six and we always look at this
01:15 - inequality symbol from the variabl
01:18 - perspective because we could write this
01:21 - as this which means that 6 is less than
01:24 - S but it means that s is greater than
01:28 - six so s is is greater than 6 or we
01:32 - could say that t is less than 7 and
01:36 - those are what basic inequalities look
01:39 - like so when we
01:42 - solve our inequalities we're going to
01:45 - graph them and you always graph the
01:49 - solution to an inequality on a number
01:52 - line so when you have an
01:55 - inequality that
01:57 - has less than or
02:01 - equal I'm sorry if you have an
02:05 - inequality that's less than or greater
02:08 - than when you graph it you're going to
02:09 - use an open circle and that's not going
02:11 - to really make sense to you right now
02:13 - but it will in a minute when we go on to
02:15 - graphing but if you have less than or
02:18 - equal to or greater than or equal to
02:21 - it's going to be a closed
02:24 - Circle and the most important thing to
02:29 - remember when Sol in inequalities is
02:31 - that if you divide or multiply your
02:33 - inequality by a
02:36 - negative you must flip your inequality
02:39 - so if I had X is less than 2 when I
02:44 - divide by the ne1 I'm going to get X is
02:48 - greater than -2 that inequality sign has
02:53 - to flip otherwise you're going to get
02:55 - the wrong
02:56 - answer so now let's do
03:00 - an
03:00 - example 9 is less than 3 * the quantity
03:07 - of 1 minus s and this is an S if you
03:10 - couldn't tell sorry kind of looks like a
03:12 - weird five so first thing we're do we're
03:15 - going to do is distribute that three
03:17 - over 9 is less than 3 - 3
03:23 - S I'm
03:26 - going
03:28 - to subtract ract three from both sides
03:31 - and I get 6 is less than -3 s I'm going
03:36 - to divide by3 and -3 and when you solve
03:41 - this this is what you want to think if
03:44 - you divide by a
03:46 - negative if you divide by a
03:49 - negative then you flip your
03:53 - sign so
03:56 - -2 and we're going to flip it is greater
03:59 - than
04:00 - S so that means s is less than -2 either
04:05 - way is
04:07 - correct so when I said when we graph it
04:10 - on a number line we we we're going to
04:12 - graph it on a number line that looks
04:13 - like this so we're going to find -2 on
04:17 - the number line which it will be right
04:20 - here and we're going to put a
04:23 - circle over
04:25 - -2 now remember if it's just less than
04:30 - or greater than it's going to have an
04:32 - open
04:33 - circle and if
04:35 - it's less than or equal to or greater
04:38 - than or equal to we're going to have a
04:39 - closed Circle so since it's only less
04:42 - than we're going to have
04:45 - a open
04:47 - circle and we're going to shade the
04:54 - direction
04:56 - of the inequality so there's two
05:02 - ways you can remember this you can
05:05 - remember
05:07 - that this inequality points to the left
05:11 - so I'm going to shade to the
05:14 - left or you can think of it more ma more
05:19 - mathematically and we're going to put an
05:20 - arrow right here because
05:23 - remember lines go on forever or you
05:26 - could plug in a number that's on
05:30 - the left of your circle which would be
05:32 - like -4 well is -4 less than -2 yes
05:38 - because remember as we go as we get more
05:43 - negative we're decreasing in
05:46 - value and then you would pick a number
05:48 - to your right to make sure that it
05:50 - doesn't work to your right well is two
05:53 - less than -2 no it's greater than -2 so
05:57 - that's how you know that you were
05:58 - supposed to shade it this
06:01 - way so we have one more example that
06:03 - we're going to
06:08 - do
06:10 - so -3 * the quantity of 2 m - 8 is less
06:16 - than or equal to 2 quanti time the
06:19 - quantity of n + 2 so first thing we're
06:21 - going to do is
06:25 - distribute on both sides of the equation
06:29 - so we have --6 m +
06:33 - 24 less than or equal to 2 m + 28 now
06:39 - some of you might say that well didn't
06:43 - we didn't we multiply by a
06:46 - negative yes we did but we don't flip
06:51 - the sign yet because we only multiplied
06:54 - one side by a negative it only affects
06:58 - your inequality when you have to
07:00 - multiply both sides or divide both sides
07:03 - by a
07:05 - negative so then I'm going to move the 2
07:10 - m this way and this is going to be I'm
07:13 - going to subtract 2 m from both sides so
07:15 - this becomes -8 m + 24 less than or
07:19 - equal 28 I'm going to subtract 24 from
07:22 - both sides and I get -8 m is less than
07:26 - or equal to 4 so I'm I'm going to divide
07:30 - by8 and divide by8 so since I divided
07:35 - both sides by a negative number I'm
07:38 - going to flip my
07:40 - inequality and if I reduce this this
07:43 - becomes -
07:46 - one2 so we're going to find - one2 on
07:49 - our number line which is going to be
07:51 - about right there and we're going to put
07:53 - a circle on
07:56 - it okay so if you remember remember your
08:00 - rules for graphing since this is greater
08:03 - than or equal to -12 we're going to
08:08 - close this circle and fill it
08:11 - in because if you think about it -
08:15 - one2 is less than or equal to - one2 yes
08:19 - that's true so we can fill that
08:21 - in and so you can think of it two ways
08:25 - you can say oh look my inequality is
08:27 - pointing that way so I'm going to shade
08:30 - in this way and we can check it
08:35 - mathematically by
08:36 - saying that plugging in a number to the
08:39 - left and to the right well if I plugged
08:42 - in -2 is -2 greater than or equal -2 no
08:48 - is three greater than or equal to -2 yes
08:52 - so I know I shaded it the right
08:54 - way so that's all we're going to do with
08:57 - inequalities today
09:01 - but make sure you come back and watch
09:03 - your next lesson where we're going to
09:04 - talk about compound inequalities that
09:07 - have more than one answer
