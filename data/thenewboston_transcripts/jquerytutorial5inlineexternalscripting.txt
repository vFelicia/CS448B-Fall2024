00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the New Boston
00:06 - in the last video we looked at testing
00:08 - jQuery once we've included it into our
00:10 - page using our script tag and we looked
00:13 - at an example that included a paragraph
00:16 - with an onclick event attribute now the
00:20 - difference between inline and external
00:23 - coding is extremely important the main
00:27 - uh difference is that we well the main
00:30 - goal is to keep our JavaScript as
00:33 - separate from our HTML as possible so
00:38 - how do we solve something like not using
00:41 - this
00:43 - here but instead just having a paragraph
00:46 - on its own now the one thing to look for
00:50 - is um well in the example that I used in
00:53 - the uh few tutorials back I included
00:56 - another uh Javascript file into my page
00:59 - that allowed me to use this
01:01 - functionality so the difference between
01:04 - inline and external is that we don't
01:06 - actually have any code inside of our
01:09 - tags but we can still use the same
01:12 - functionality so let's go ahead and
01:14 - create a new
01:16 - file um I'm going to leave this blank
01:18 - for now but inside of our G folder I'm
01:21 - going to call this hide.
01:25 - JS now inside of hide. JS I'm going to
01:30 - include some functionality uh the same
01:32 - as we did in the last example that
01:35 - actually allows us to hide this
01:36 - paragraph when we click on it but we're
01:38 - not going to include any code on the
01:40 - paragraph instead what we're going to do
01:42 - is reference the paragraph um as opposed
01:45 - to include this code in here so the
01:48 - first thing we need to do is give an ID
01:50 - to this paragraph and this will allow us
01:52 - to uniquely identify the paragraph so
01:55 - I'm just going to call this
01:58 - paragraph now now that we have an ID we
02:01 - can use paragraph inside hide. JS to
02:04 - actually reference this but beforehand
02:07 - we need to actually include this hide.
02:09 - JS file under here which will allow us
02:12 - to use the functionality within it so
02:15 - I'm going to say script type is equal to
02:18 - and I'm just going to end that
02:19 - tag the type is
02:22 - text/javascript exactly the same and the
02:25 - source is Js slide. Js so now we
02:30 - included this hide. JS file we can start
02:33 - to write the code within it and check
02:35 - for when the user has actually clicked
02:37 - on this paragraph So let's go ahead to
02:39 - hide. JS what we're going to do is we're
02:42 - going to use the same notation so a
02:44 - dollar sign inside we're going to
02:46 - reference remember before we used this
02:49 - to reference it inside we're going to
02:52 - reference it with the hash and that's
02:55 - paragraph we're then going to say um dot
02:59 - click
03:01 - and in
03:02 - Brackets and then inside of here we need
03:05 - to create a function now don't worry too
03:07 - much if you are actually uh or you're
03:10 - unsure of the syntax or unsure of the
03:13 - method method that I'm using this is
03:15 - just an example to demonstrate the
03:17 - difference between inline and external
03:19 - uh code so we're going to be looking at
03:22 - this click uh event
03:24 - handler a bit later on um so if you're
03:27 - unsure uh as of yet then continue
03:30 - watching and you'll understand it a bit
03:32 - later on in the series so inside of
03:34 - Click we need to create a function and
03:37 - we need to write our um block out here
03:41 - which we're just going to pull down so
03:43 - inside of here is our code that happens
03:46 - when we actually click this paragraph So
03:49 - when the user clicks this paragraph
03:51 - it'll be identified by paragraph it will
03:54 - be picked up in hide. JS here so when
03:58 - the user clicks and we carry out this
04:00 - function and this function will
04:04 - be hash sorry hash
04:10 - paragraph. hide okay so now when the
04:14 - user clicks on this paragraph it will
04:16 - hide it this is essentially what is
04:19 - happening here so let's go back to our
04:21 - page and refresh you'll see that we've
04:23 - got the paragraph here however we don't
04:25 - have any inline JavaScript at all we
04:28 - just use this high hide .js to look for
04:31 - a click and that hide. JS file is
04:34 - included under here so let's go ahead
04:37 - and click the paragraph and see what
04:38 - happens well now the paragraph has been
04:41 - hidden and we know it's been hidden
04:43 - because we included the same
04:44 - functionality in hide. JS as we
04:46 - essentially or or previously did inside
04:50 - parag inside the paragraph tag so now
04:53 - you can see that using jQuery is
04:54 - extremely easy to stop inline writing of
04:58 - code and in instead use an external file
05:01 - that checks for event handlers now as I
05:03 - said if you don't quite understand the
05:05 - code that's not a problem uh the main
05:07 - point of this tutorial was to
05:09 - demonstrate the difference between
05:11 - inline and external and we've now
05:13 - actually eliminated the need for in uh
05:15 - inline coding so throughout the tutorial
05:18 - series we're not going to be using
05:19 - inline coding everything's going to be
05:22 - done from external files and the reason
05:24 - for this is that it's best practice to
05:26 - keep everything external and keep
05:29 - JavaScript
05:30 - away from HTML
