00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg
00:03 - and this is a PHP video tutorial for the
00:05 - new Boston now if you're just getting
00:08 - started with PHP and want to start
00:10 - developing you're going to need
00:12 - somewhere to test your code now you may
00:15 - have already purchased paid hosting and
00:17 - you may be able to upload PHP files
00:19 - check with your hosts to see if they
00:21 - allow PHP extensions 99% of paid and
00:27 - free hosting will allow you to run PHP
00:29 - on the server it is pretty much a must
00:32 - in most cases for most hosting companies
00:35 - so what happens if we want to test
00:38 - everything locally on our local computer
00:40 - it's fair enough us creating a PHP file
00:43 - and uploading it to a server but we want
00:46 - to quickly develop we want to develop
00:47 - quickly and easily on our local machine
00:51 - so what we can do is we can essentially
00:54 - turn our computer into a web server now
00:57 - it's highly unrealistic server because
01:01 - if it's not properly configured your PHP
01:04 - ini files not properly configured or
01:06 - anything else is not configured you're
01:09 - going to run into trouble so you're
01:10 - going to have some security issues there
01:12 - so bear in mind that everything I'm
01:13 - showing you is to setup a your opening
01:16 - another port on your computer so you're
01:18 - opening up port 80 on your computer
01:19 - which is going to allow people to access
01:21 - everything that you put into your htdocs
01:24 - folder if you don't know what I'm
01:26 - talking about that's fine I'm going to
01:28 - go ahead and explain to you what you
01:30 - should do in order to create or install
01:34 - this mini webserver onto your computer
01:36 - now I personally use xampp and the whole
01:42 - thing behind your web server and PHP is
01:46 - that you're going to be using apache and
01:49 - then PHP is a module if you like on top
01:53 - of Apache which allows you to compile in
01:56 - the background server-side because PHP
01:59 - is a server-side language it allows you
02:01 - to compile and PHP files and run them
02:04 - and display the contents of your actions
02:06 - in the browser so basically you need
02:10 - something like xampp or something
02:13 - like w amp I'm showing you double that W
02:17 - amp
02:18 - simply because you know if you're having
02:21 - problems with that example for any
02:23 - reason you want to use W app but I'm
02:25 - just going to show you that to say you
02:26 - to tell you that is available however
02:29 - I'm going to be dealing with xampp and
02:31 - xampp default directories things like
02:33 - that so if you'd like to follow along
02:35 - with this tutorial i'm going to be using
02:37 - xampp otherwise going install w amp and
02:40 - see if you can take anything from this
02:41 - tutorial away with you and in apply to w
02:46 - amp settings as well now the first thing
02:48 - you're going to need to do is obviously
02:50 - come to Apache friends org and you're
02:53 - going to come down here and you're going
02:55 - to say xampp for windows linux mac OS
02:58 - solaris anything any the obviously
03:00 - operating system that you are using so
03:03 - it's obviously free of charge we've got
03:06 - little screenshots here an easy
03:09 - installation the installation etc etc
03:11 - etc so you can download you can download
03:17 - this for Windows by just simply clicking
03:19 - xampp for windows and i'm going to be
03:21 - giving you the example here and running
03:23 - through for windows so i'm not going to
03:25 - be using linux mac OS or solaris i I'm
03:29 - going to be using windows in this case
03:31 - so once you've clicked the file or click
03:35 - this link you're going to come down and
03:37 - you're going to say download xampp here
03:39 - so when the installation here says
03:42 - method a installation within with the
03:45 - installer or without the install and
03:46 - we're going to choose xampp here and
03:49 - what that's going to do is we can click
03:52 - on installer so i'd highly recommend you
03:54 - install it with the installer we're
03:56 - going to click that and it's going to
03:57 - download so pretty simple stuff you're
04:00 - going to open this installation file and
04:02 - once you once it's downloaded so
04:05 - obviously it's hosted with SourceForge
04:06 - so you're going to save this file you're
04:08 - going to wait till that's download it's
04:10 - sixty three point two megabytes and as
04:12 - it stands for this version
