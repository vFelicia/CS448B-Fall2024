00:00 - hello this is Alex from PHP Academy and
00:02 - this is another video for the new Boston
00:04 - on appending uh data onto the end of a
00:07 - file or the contents um inside the file
00:11 - so we've already established we've
00:12 - opened up names.txt with the um property
00:15 - of right s writing to it um we've
00:18 - written the name Alex and Billy and we
00:22 - also have closed the file and then given
00:23 - a written confirmation so what I'm
00:26 - actually going to do now is I'm going to
00:29 - um
00:30 - open up the file itself so yeah
00:33 - names.txt
00:35 - now what happens if I want to add to
00:38 - this list so I'm going to change this to
00:41 - a okay now I'm going to put Steve oh
00:46 - Steven that's fine and I'm going to put
00:49 - um
00:51 - Tom so what I've done now is I've
00:54 - written um I've already written a name
00:57 - in fact let's just get rid of that um
00:58 - I've already written names to to uh this
01:01 - file if we go back and have a look
01:03 - refresh it Alex and Billy uh now what I
01:06 - want to do is say
01:08 - another line break after um Billy write
01:14 - the name Steven and then another line
01:15 - break
01:17 - um and this is a pending whereas before
01:20 - if we were doing W it would overwrite
01:23 - everything in the file so if we use a
01:26 - and uh we go back and we click on file
01:29 - we can see that it's simply added it to
01:31 - the to the end of the list
01:34 - um now if we go back um I'll show you an
01:37 - example in case you haven't caught it if
01:39 - I was to just do a
01:40 - w now watch what happens when I run the
01:44 - file so file.php we go back you can see
01:47 - now that we just have the name Steven
01:50 - and we have that line break before that
01:52 - so you can now understand the importance
01:55 - of using the W or the
01:57 - append now why do we have these two um
02:01 - these two features um obviously uh we
02:04 - need to at one at one instance we need
02:07 - to open up a file and write to it and
02:10 - then we close it and we may never need
02:12 - to use it again however in most cases
02:15 - we'll be opening up um a file and
02:18 - rewriting names to it and I'm going to
02:20 - give you a real life
02:22 - example let's um we'll just tighten this
02:25 - code up a bit here and um we're going to
02:28 - keep it as a penned but I'm going to get
02:30 - rid of this just here for now now I'm
02:33 - going to come under here and I'm going
02:34 - to create a form and the action of the
02:38 - form is going to be uh file.php the file
02:41 - we're currently using and the method is
02:44 - going to be post now what I'm going to
02:46 - do is end the
02:48 - form and I'm going to specify um a form
02:52 - field for the user to enter a name so uh
02:55 - name and then input type equals text uh
03:00 - name equals name and I'm going to break
03:03 - down a couple more lines and input type
03:07 - equals submit and the uh value of that
03:12 - is submit so this is what we're
03:14 - displaying to the user okay so let's
03:17 - just comment out this code for now and
03:19 - preview our form and we can
03:23 - see what it looks like oh know that's
03:25 - names.txt file.php okay so this is what
03:28 - it looks like um
03:30 - let's just uh get rid of names.txt
03:39 - Okay so we've got rid of names.txt if we
03:42 - open up the browser we can see that
03:44 - that's now gone now what we need to do
03:47 - is we need to um this this is
03:49 - automatically this data is automatically
03:51 - going to be posted um as we've seen
03:54 - before with far handling so what we need
03:56 - to do is before we um create this in
03:59 - fact we'll get rid of that all together
04:01 - what we want to do is we want to perform
04:02 - a check to see if this variable is set
04:05 - so if
04:07 - um name is set remember uh we're posting
04:11 - this from here so we're using the dollar
04:13 - undor poost because we've set the method
04:15 - to post and we're using the is set
04:17 - function to check this has been set so
04:19 - if it has been set we can uh specify
04:21 - this variable so I'm going to say name
04:24 - equals
04:26 - um uh dollar
04:28 - uncore post
04:31 - name okay uh now what we want to do is
04:34 - we want to say if not
04:38 - empty
04:41 - name
04:44 - else and in here we can just do an error
04:46 - message please type oh dear type a name
04:52 - okay so in here what we want to do now
04:54 - is if the user has entered um a name
04:58 - we're all okay so we can just test the
05:00 - functionality of this now click on
05:02 - file.php so I'm going to type in a name
05:06 - Alex click submit so that's okay if we
05:09 - don't type anything in it prompts us to
05:10 - type a name so this is all very well and
05:12 - good but now we're inside here what do
05:15 - we want to do we want to open up a
05:17 - handle and we want to
05:20 - open names.txt and we want to open up
05:24 - this to append now what we want to do is
05:27 - fite and we want to write to handle so
05:31 - what data do we want to write to this we
05:32 - want to write name now we want to append
05:35 - on a line break so a back slash and N so
05:40 - the functionality of this program is
05:42 - we're asking the user to enter names and
05:44 - every time they click submit and they
05:46 - submit a new name it's going to write it
05:47 - to a new line in this file so this is a
05:49 - real life example of where you can store
05:51 - data for um your user input now we're
05:55 - going to say f close you'll important F
05:57 - close and we're going to say handle
05:58 - inside that so now let's check if it
06:00 - works um at the moment if we go back to
06:03 - our file handling directory we've got no
06:05 - names.txt but once we type a name in and
06:09 - click submit uh we haven't given a
06:11 - confirmation message but what we can do
06:13 - is we can go back to here you can see
06:16 - that um a names.txt file exists and
06:19 - we've got Alex in there so let's go back
06:21 - again and type a new name in Click
06:24 - submit okay and let's type in Steven
06:27 - while we're here and we can type Tom
06:31 - while we're here as well so submit so
06:33 - now if we go back to file handling
06:34 - directory and look in our names.txt we
06:37 - can see that this has appended each name
06:39 - that we've processed through the form
06:42 - that's appended that onto the end um of
06:44 - well the end of the content of this file
06:47 - so that's about it for um appending um
06:51 - in the next tutorial we're going to be
06:52 - look at reading this data in and then
06:55 - displaying it back out to the
06:57 - user
