00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:02 - and this is a PHP video tutorial for the
00:05 - new Boston now this is a quick
00:07 - introduction to XML now some of you may
00:11 - have heard XML some of you may not but
00:14 - XML is becoming an integral part of the
00:17 - Internet in how we transfer and pick up
00:20 - data from different websites and also
00:24 - how we can transfer data from say a
00:27 - database to another database using
00:30 - custom tags inside an XML file now XML
00:35 - stands for extensible markup language
00:37 - and it is a markup language so it's
00:40 - similar to HTML in the way that we use
00:42 - markup tags so let's just give you an
00:45 - example here in HTML we would define our
00:48 - HTML tags like this or in XML what we
00:51 - can do is we create custom tags that
00:54 - allow us to specify data and pick up
00:57 - data using different tags so for example
01:00 - I might have a name tag and we end it
01:05 - exactly the same as we do and this name
01:07 - tag might be Alex and we might have this
01:10 - inside producer tag and then what we
01:17 - might have is many producers so we might
01:19 - in fact have a few names down the list
01:26 - and then we might have an inside these
01:32 - inside these different producers and
01:39 - information about different producers so
01:41 - we might have this outside taggers
01:43 - producers and inside we might have let's
01:48 - just get rid of everything we might have
01:52 - producer and then that there and then
01:59 - inside we might have a name
02:09 - [Music]
02:12 - and then we might then what we can do is
02:15 - we can duplicate this and have another
02:17 - producer and another producer
02:19 - so we can change these values here oh
02:26 - now this may all look odd and may not
02:30 - make sense at first however what we have
02:33 - done here is we've created a structured
02:36 - way of displaying our data now if I was
02:39 - to say to someone if you open up an XML
02:42 - file at the moment I'm working with the
02:43 - PHP file so pretend this is dot XML if
02:47 - this was next in our document and I said
02:49 - to someone okay well and bring up the
02:51 - second and third producer what would be
02:54 - able to is access these tags so we'd be
02:57 - able to access the producers take first
02:59 - of all and then coming through and say
03:01 - we'd have say feed this into an array
03:04 - and we'll be able to select just this
03:07 - information the name in the age of the
03:10 - two producers two last producers so it's
03:13 - a great way to transfer data around the
03:16 - web and in a format that's recognizable
03:19 - depending on what tags you've used so
03:22 - you can have an agreement of what tags
03:24 - are and which tags are required or not
03:26 - so this XML data we can read it in
03:32 - through different web applications and
03:34 - software applications however why is it
03:38 - useful to us as PHP programmers now you
03:42 - may have noticed that or may know that
03:45 - Facebook things like Facebook Twitter
03:47 - YouTube all have preset XML files for
03:54 - different users so for example let's
03:57 - just bring up an example of a YouTube
04:00 - XML document now it's not correctly
04:03 - structured in terms of indenting and
04:06 - things like that if we go down we can
04:09 - start to see information about about
04:13 - videos from this will the user PHP
04:16 - academy'
04:17 - so we've got if you look carefully you
04:21 - can see things like
04:23 - have a look okay you've got here you've
04:25 - got a description so you've got a
04:28 - description there of a video and if you
04:32 - come down you've got some more
04:33 - information and you can see that we've
04:35 - got these media tags here you've got
04:41 - let's just go up should be some more
04:46 - around it's quite hard to see this
04:48 - because it's very yes so that we've got
04:53 - author there this is just general
04:56 - information from this a PR document but
04:59 - if we go down we can see this is an
05:00 - extensive amount of data in here but it
05:04 - all can be read in using PHP now what
05:08 - we're going to do is we're going to work
05:09 - with creating our own simple XML files
05:12 - and reading them in and learning how to
05:14 - read them in and then what we're going
05:16 - to do is we're going to take an example
05:17 - of a data feed from either youtube or
05:21 - another or another social networking
05:23 - site that we can access i uses feeds for
05:26 - example from twitter and things like
05:30 - that and we are going to read in things
05:34 - like that so now that you know what xml
05:36 - is you can go away and fiddle around
05:39 - with different websites and how they
05:40 - produce their xml have a careful look at
05:43 - it some might be structured some might
05:45 - be not like this and then in the next
05:48 - lessons we can start reading this data
05:50 - in and in fact then we can start storing
05:53 - this data and once we know the structure
05:57 - of over xml document and we can simply
06:01 - write an xml file using file handling so
06:04 - we can output different lines to the
06:07 - file depending on the tags that we've
06:10 - specified so I won't be going through
06:12 - how to write your own XML file but we
06:15 - will be looking extensively at reading
06:17 - in XML files and then how to read in
06:21 - data like this
