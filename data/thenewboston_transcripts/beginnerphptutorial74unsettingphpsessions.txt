00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog
00:02 - with another video for the new Boston
00:04 - now we've already looked at setting PHP
00:08 - sessions and why they're useful however
00:10 - if we wanted to unset a session for any
00:13 - reason or unset a particular session or
00:16 - unset all sessions we need a way to do
00:20 - this and there's a couple of ways that
00:21 - you can do this either by unsetting an
00:24 - individual session you might not want to
00:26 - end all your sessions but we can we've
00:29 - got a function called unset that's going
00:31 - to unset a particular session that we
00:33 - specify or you can use another function
00:36 - called session destroy' which will unset
00:38 - all the sessions related to that user
00:41 - and your server so in this set dot PHP
00:45 - file we've already started up our
00:46 - session and we've and we've set a
00:50 - session called username to the value of
00:52 - Alex and in the view we're checking for
00:54 - this now I'm going to create a new file
00:57 - and I'm going to call this an unset PHP
01:00 - now this might be a logout file you
01:02 - might be logging your users out we've
01:04 - already spoken about why sessions might
01:06 - be useful for login systems we might be
01:08 - even clearing the total of a user's
01:11 - basket or deleting items from a user's
01:14 - basket so just imagine this is a logout
01:18 - page now you may for example want to
01:21 - unset a particular session now to do
01:24 - this you want to use unset now you can
01:28 - see that the the session is called
01:30 - session or it's called user name so I'm
01:34 - going to unset dollar underscore session
01:40 - user name now there's a fundamental
01:42 - mistake I've made in this file on
01:45 - purpose just so you can see why now
01:47 - let's go ahead and set this I'm going to
01:50 - go back and I'm going to click on View
01:52 - and you can see that it's welcoming me
01:53 - here so we've already looked at this
01:55 - example now if I'm to click on unset PHP
01:58 - and then go back and then click on view
02:01 - again you can see that it still says
02:03 - welcome Alex
02:04 - now why is this the case when we've used
02:06 - this unset feature or this function to
02:09 - unset this username and the simple
02:11 - answer is I've actually purposely for
02:13 - Center per session star so even though
02:16 - your unsetting sessions you still need
02:18 - to declare this function or call this
02:20 - function in order to unset your sessions
02:23 - and it with the same for the other
02:24 - example I'm going to show you in just a
02:26 - moment so let's go back and click set
02:28 - just to make sure that's definitely set
02:30 - click on view and it says welcome Alex
02:32 - so now let's go back and click on unset
02:35 - now this time we should have succeeded
02:37 - in unsetting that session so if we click
02:39 - on view analysis please log in so you
02:42 - may come across in your programs when
02:44 - you're using this oh that the sessions
02:46 - not unsetting you know why is this this
02:48 - might be a question in your mind why
02:50 - isn't it working it's it's frustrating
02:51 - you the answer is always check that
02:53 - you've correctly started your sessions
02:55 - up before you try to unset them now what
02:59 - if I want to have a couple of sessions
03:00 - that I want to I want to unset so I want
03:08 - to unset more than one session in fact
03:09 - all the sessions that exist so I'm going
03:12 - to make a few changes to this program
03:14 - under set I'm going to set another
03:16 - session and this is going to be called
03:19 - age and I'm going to set this equal to
03:21 - 21 now on view we're going to say if is
03:25 - sept session username and dollar
03:28 - underscore note remember another another
03:31 - intercept function in there so we're
03:33 - checking that both these sessions exist
03:36 - and then we're saying welcome to the
03:38 - username and then we're going to say you
03:41 - are and then we're going to specify my
03:45 - age just by cooling that in there or
03:49 - concatenate in that so now what's the
03:52 - result we're going to achieve if we come
03:55 - and reset our sessions and we come back
03:59 - and click view welcome Alex you are 21
04:02 - so we've used two different sessions now
04:04 - now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
04:07 - click on set I'm going to go back again
04:11 - and click on View in fact this is a bad
04:14 - example because we're checking for both
04:16 - of these let's just
04:19 - get rid of that there okay so now if i
04:23 - refresh you can see welcome and then a
04:25 - common than a full stop because just one
04:27 - of the sessions is missing remember in
04:29 - this unset file we're only unsetting the
04:31 - username so let's just reset everything
04:34 - again so we can view the example of
04:36 - unsetting all of them click view so now
04:39 - this has been displayed correctly now
04:41 - what happens if I want to unset all
04:43 - sessions so I'm going to get rid of this
04:45 - line and I'm simply going to type
04:46 - session underscore destroy now what this
04:50 - command here is going to do when we call
04:52 - this function we are sunsetting all
04:55 - sessions that are currently that
04:56 - currently exist so not for all users
05:00 - across your website but just between the
05:02 - connection me and the server so now what
05:05 - I can do is I'm going to refresh again
05:06 - just so you can see that the data is
05:08 - still there now I'm going to click unset
05:10 - I'm going to get back again I'm going to
05:13 - click view and we've removed both the
05:16 - session data so we remove my name and my
05:18 - age so that's basically unsetting
05:21 - session data in PHP
