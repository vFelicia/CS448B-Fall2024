00:00 - what's going on guys it is Bucky and
00:01 - welcome to your 37th JavaScript tutorial
00:04 - and in this tutorial I want to go over
00:06 - something called the date object now the
00:08 - day object is a really useful built-in
00:10 - object whenever you're working with the
00:12 - date and the time so what it does is
00:15 - whenever you create a day object it goes
00:17 - ahead and it grabs the current date
00:19 - which is in this case 331 2011 and it
00:22 - also grabs the current time which is
00:24 - 3:21 p.m. so let's go ahead and before I
00:28 - get into the DAT object even more I want
00:30 - to show you guys a special function that
00:32 - we're going to be using and that's
00:34 - called the set interval function so what
00:36 - the set interval function does is it
00:39 - someone's texting me hold on let me see
00:41 - who it
00:43 - is H some girls macking on me sorry girl
00:47 - you're going to have to wait I'm doing a
00:49 - tutorial so anyways what the set
00:50 - interval function does is it runs a
00:53 - function
00:55 - however however much time you want to
00:57 - increment it by so for example you can
00:58 - run a function every second or every 5
01:00 - seconds so this is really hard to
01:02 - explain so I'm just going to show you
01:04 - guys an example so function we just name
01:06 - it like do something and what this
01:09 - function is going to do is just print
01:11 - something out on the screen so document
01:16 - WR and just go ahead and write like tuna
01:18 - on the screen or something tune K who
01:20 - the heck cares so set interval takes two
01:24 - parameters the first parameter it takes
01:26 - is what function do you want to run well
01:29 - I'm just going to run that do something
01:32 - and make sure there we go it's the right
01:33 - one make sure I didn't have any typos
01:36 - and the second parameter is the
01:38 - increment you want to run in and this is
01:40 - in milliseconds so if you write 1,000
01:42 - milliseconds that means 1 second so now
01:46 - what's going to happen is this you're
01:47 - going to have your function called do
01:49 - something and all this does is print
01:50 - something out on the screen and you're
01:52 - going to say run this function every 1
01:54 - second so now if you go ahead and launch
01:56 - this in Chrome it's going to say tuna
01:59 - tuna tuna tuna tuna every single second
02:04 - so that's a pretty cool function um
02:06 - again that's called the set interval
02:07 - function and the reason I want to
02:09 - explain it to you guys is because we're
02:10 - going to be using it in the program
02:12 - we're going to be building right now so
02:14 - anyways the program I'm going to be
02:15 - making is this I'm going to be making a
02:17 - basic clock and what this clock is going
02:20 - to do is each second it's going to give
02:23 - you what time it is so it's going to say
02:26 - 323 323 1 second 323 2 seconds seconds
02:30 - 323 3 seconds so it's not going to be
02:33 - formatted nicely and it's not going to
02:35 - be real pretty because I only have like
02:36 - seven more minutes to make it but I'm
02:38 - just going to try to explain you guys
02:40 - what the date object is and how the date
02:43 - object is useful whenever you create
02:44 - things like clocks so the first thing
02:46 - that we're going to be needing is a
02:48 - function that we're going to be calling
02:49 - every second so go ahead and make a
02:51 - function and I'm going to name mine
02:52 - print time because all this is going to
02:54 - do is print the Timeout on your
02:57 - computer got a hairball print the
03:00 - Timeout on your computer screen so go
03:02 - ahead and make a variable called now and
03:04 - in order to make a new dat object go
03:06 - ahead and press new date with empty
03:10 - parentheses and what this does is it's
03:12 - going to go ahead and grab the current
03:14 - time of day and also the date and store
03:17 - it in a variable called now so now that
03:20 - variable called now holds the current
03:22 - date and the current time so it holds a
03:25 - lot of information but we want to access
03:28 - certain pieces of information such as
03:30 - the hours the minutes and the current
03:33 - seconds and what we're going to be doing
03:34 - with this information is just printing
03:36 - it out so let's go ahead and make a
03:37 - couple variables variables hours is
03:40 - going to be equal to now which is the
03:42 - day object and the method to get the
03:45 - hours in that day object is get hours so
03:49 - for example right now like I said it's
03:52 - 3:24 p.m. so it's going to get the
03:55 - number 15 because 15 is the number of
03:58 - hours in military time of 3:00 the
04:01 - reason it doesn't grab 3 even though
04:03 - it's 3:24 p.m. is because if it just
04:06 - spit out the number 3 you wouldn't know
04:08 - if it was 3:00 a.m. or 3:00 p.m. so
04:11 - that's why it uh whoever made JavaScript
04:14 - decided to get it in military time so
04:16 - this is going to have 15 stored in the
04:20 - variable hours which is equal to 3:00 so
04:23 - now let's go ahead and make the variable
04:24 - minutes which is equal to now. getet
04:28 - minutes and like I said right now the
04:31 - current time is
04:32 - 3:25 so now this variable is going to be
04:35 - equal to 25 pretty cool huh and last but
04:39 - not least you can probably guess what
04:40 - I'm going to do now variable seconds
04:42 - equals now get seconds so this is the
04:46 - number that's going to be changing on
04:47 - our screen every time it's going to be
04:49 - like 15 16 17 18 and it's going to print
04:53 - out a new second every time since is
04:56 - every second it's going to be grabbing
04:58 - all that information and and the seconds
05:00 - is going to be changing every time we
05:01 - print it out so basically all these
05:04 - variables are doing are grabbing the
05:05 - current hours the current minutes and
05:07 - the current seconds simple enough so now
05:10 - all we have to do is print it out on the
05:12 - screen so document do write and let me
05:17 - just go ahead and write it in a hours
05:22 - plus plus
05:26 - colon plus mins Plus
05:31 - colon plus
05:35 - seconds and um after seconds I'm just
05:37 - going to add a line break because what
05:39 - we could do is make this appear on the
05:41 - same line but I'm just going to make the
05:43 - new time appear on the new line every
05:45 - time since I don't have that much time
05:47 - to make a you know pretty looking alarm
05:50 - clock so um I think this is good so what
05:52 - this is going to do is it's going to
05:54 - print out 15 26 30 15 26 31 1 15 26 32
06:02 - so on and so forth so let's go ahead and
06:05 - check it out we now have a function that
06:08 - prints out the current time but now we
06:10 - have to use that set interval function
06:13 - that we learned before to call this
06:15 - function every 1 second so again like I
06:17 - said it takes two parameters the first
06:19 - parameter is print time or in other
06:22 - words what function do we want to call
06:24 - and the second parameter is how often do
06:26 - we want to call it 1,000 milliseconds
06:28 - AKA where we want going to call this
06:29 - function every 1 second so now let's go
06:32 - ahead and save it and launching Chrome
06:35 - and I got a typo somewhere so hold on
06:38 - I'll find it for
06:39 - you all right guys I found my error I
06:42 - accidentally type get menus instead of
06:45 - get minutes so now that I threw the T in
06:48 - there it actually should work now so
06:49 - let's go ahead and launching Chrome
06:52 - there we go 15 29 49 50 51 52 53 54 so
07:00 - every second it calls that function in
07:03 - again like I said I could have formatted
07:05 - this nicely so you know it maybe would
07:07 - have said 3:00 instead of military time
07:09 - and maybe I could have put it on the
07:11 - same line of having it instead of having
07:12 - it appear on a different line every time
07:15 - but hey I only have like 10 minutes to
07:16 - make these tutorials so that's what you
07:18 - get so basically what I wanted to show
07:20 - you guys in this tutorial is we can use
07:22 - the set interval function which is a
07:24 - built-in function in JavaScript to call
07:27 - one of our functions in a certain time
07:30 - increment in this case every second so
07:32 - in this example every second it called
07:34 - our function print time and all print
07:36 - time does is it used that day object to
07:39 - store the current time of day in the
07:42 - variable now and what we did is there
07:45 - are a bunch of different informations in
07:47 - that object three of them are get hours
07:49 - get minutes and get seconds we use those
07:51 - pieces of information to make a very
07:54 - simple clock on our website um again the
07:58 - date object has has a lot of different
08:00 - methods that are associated with it if I
08:02 - went through all the methods then it
08:04 - would take an awful lot of time and I
08:06 - don't have that much time in these
08:07 - tutorials it'll take like 20 tutorials
08:10 - to teach you guys of all the different
08:11 - methods but if you want to learn those
08:13 - methods uh go to the JavaScript website
08:15 - whatever the heck it is and you can
08:17 - check them out but anyways whenever
08:19 - you're working with dates such as
08:21 - building a calendar or times such as
08:23 - building an alarm clock this is the
08:26 - object that you need to use and this is
08:28 - how you create it right here here so
08:30 - hopefully you guys learned the concepts
08:32 - of set interval and also how to use the
08:34 - date object for something in a kind of
08:37 - useful program so for now that's all I
08:39 - have for you guys so thank you guys for
08:41 - watching don't forget to subscribe and
08:42 - I'll see you guys next video
