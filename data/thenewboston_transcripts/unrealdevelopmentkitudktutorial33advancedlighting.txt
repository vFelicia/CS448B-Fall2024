00:00 - all right guys welcome to your 33rd udk
00:03 - tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
00:05 - to be talking to you guys about lighting
00:07 - to be honest I'm probably going to be
00:08 - talking to you guys about lighting for
00:10 - like the next four or five tutorials
00:13 - because there is a ton of stuff to cover
00:15 - so if you were just sitting there saying
00:17 - you know what Bucky I already know
00:19 - everything there is to know about
00:20 - lighting just go ahead and hold L on
00:22 - your keyboard click and Bam all there is
00:25 - to know about lighting we got a light on
00:27 - our level well believe it or not there's
00:30 - actually a lot more that goes into
00:31 - lighting that we can achieve some
00:33 - awesome effects it can pretty much take
00:35 - our levels to the next level H probably
00:38 - shouldn't use a level two times in one
00:40 - sentence it could take our maps to the
00:42 - next level there we go when we learn to
00:45 - use lighting properly so in this
00:47 - tutorial all I'm going to be doing is
00:49 - showing you an alternative way to add
00:51 - lights and taking you through some of
00:53 - the more common interfaces and windows
00:56 - whenever you're working with lights so
00:59 - I'm not going to be teaching you a whole
01:00 - lot of new stuff in this tutorial I just
01:01 - want to show you around the lighting
01:03 - world so to speak so I already taught
01:06 - you guys one way in our last tutorials
01:08 - how to add lights to your maps and
01:10 - that's of course hold L on your keyboard
01:13 - and click and you got a light but this
01:14 - is pretty much like a work light like
01:17 - say you were working in a garage or
01:18 - something and you just needed anything
01:21 - to light up you know a dark area you're
01:23 - like hey dude give me a light and
01:25 - whatever he shine you know whether it's
01:27 - a flashlight or a light bulb or lighter
01:29 - any way that you can light up that dark
01:31 - spot it's fine and that's basically what
01:34 - we're doing here we're basically
01:35 - throwing work lights up but whenever we
01:37 - build our level we want something a
01:39 - little more advanced that we have a lot
01:41 - more control over so typically how I'm
01:44 - going to be adding lights is this
01:45 - actually before I even do that here's my
01:48 - little nice Sample Room I made but it's
01:50 - looking kind of bland so I'm just going
01:52 - to go ahead and add a pillar real quick
01:54 - drag that out right there and let me
01:56 - make sure in my top view it's somewhere
01:58 - around and the reason I'm doing this is
02:01 - whenever I add a light it's going to
02:03 - cast a shadow and I want it you know
02:05 - something to cast a shadow rather than
02:07 - just walls so that's why you needed to
02:10 - add something to your level so now that
02:12 - you got your level with something in it
02:14 - in this case a pillar I'm going to show
02:16 - you guys the more common way that I like
02:19 - to add lights and that's go ahead and in
02:21 - your perspective view right click
02:23 - anywhere on the screen and from here
02:26 - click add actor and add a point light or
02:30 - add light parenthesis point and from
02:32 - here it's basically same as before it
02:35 - adds a light to your scene so go ahead
02:37 - and the first thing you're going to
02:39 - notice is this as soon as you add a
02:41 - light to your scene it changes from
02:43 - unlit mode to LIT mode and that's
02:45 - because udk realizes that now that you
02:48 - have a light you probably want to you
02:50 - know be able to see what's going on with
02:51 - it so the first thing you probably want
02:53 - to do is move it around a little bit
02:55 - using your translation tool translation
02:58 - mode is this called the transl ation
03:00 - tool I'm just going to call it the move
03:01 - tool and you see that the shadow kind of
03:04 - changes depending on how you move the
03:06 - light you know as you could expect so
03:09 - let me go ahead and do this first and
03:10 - foremost notice how the shadow is right
03:13 - now it's kind of crisp and whenever you
03:15 - move your light you can really easily
03:18 - see how your shadows moving but keep
03:20 - your eyes on the shadow right here and
03:22 - I'm going to go ahead and build this all
03:24 - and it's going to build and again keep
03:26 - your eyes on this Shadow right here
03:28 - because I want you guys to Noti what's
03:30 - going
03:31 - on you see how it kind of went from real
03:34 - crisp and really easy to see what was
03:37 - going on to kind of like fuzzy kind of
03:39 - give you a more realistic looking light
03:42 - this realistic looking light is called a
03:44 - shadow map and I just want to I'm not
03:47 - going to be talking about Shadow maps in
03:48 - this tutorial I just want to point out
03:50 - that there is a difference between this
03:53 - Shadow and the fuzzy Shadow and that's
03:56 - and we're going to be talking about that
03:57 - later so if your shadows look different
03:59 - than me right now don't worry about it
04:01 - you're going to understand later on so
04:03 - anyways the other thing I want to talk
04:05 - to you guys about is the light
04:07 - properties trust me there is a lot more
04:09 - properties to This Light than whether
04:11 - it's on or off so in order to access the
04:14 - properties just go ahead and select your
04:15 - light and hit F4 and check it out look
04:18 - at all of these properties just for
04:21 - light I mean we get that and that and
04:25 - this is only like one tab we get
04:26 - movement display look at all this crap
04:29 - you guys are thinking that you know
04:31 - whenever you put a light in your room or
04:33 - hang them up for your Christmas lights
04:34 - that there's on and off and that's it
04:37 - well in the udk it gives you about 6
04:39 - million options and we're actually going
04:42 - to be understanding what all these
04:43 - options mean but for now I just want to
04:45 - show you guys through the lighting
04:46 - properties window and give you guys a
04:48 - real quick tour of some of the most
04:51 - basic properties oh you have not
04:53 - registered your we project H this is let
04:57 - me just register now right in the middle
04:58 - of my freaking tutorial
05:00 - yeah I'll see you later R I don't care
05:02 - if my computer's vulnerable so anyways
05:05 - go ahead and you're probably going to be
05:07 - looking at this most go ahead and expand
05:09 - light then light component and then
05:11 - light component again you think they
05:13 - would name this tab different than this
05:14 - tab but they don't some of the more
05:16 - common and easy to understand properties
05:18 - are like the brightness which is by
05:20 - default at one but go ahead and slide
05:22 - that up and you can see that it gets
05:24 - brighter obviously um the light color if
05:28 - you want to change the overall color of
05:29 - your light to like green or
05:31 - something and of course if it cast
05:34 - Shadows or not that's one of the more
05:36 - common ones if you uncheck that check
05:38 - that out my shadow is gone we do want
05:41 - that to cast Shadows so these are just a
05:43 - bunch of different properties that you
05:45 - can change to kind of alter the way your
05:48 - light behaves so I'm not going to be
05:50 - talking about all these right now
05:52 - because well it's going to take me like
05:53 - five days first of all and this is
05:55 - tutorials just introduction of Lights I
05:57 - just want to show you guys that there
05:58 - are indeed a lot more light properties
06:01 - than just on and off so with that being
06:04 - said what's what else do I want to go
06:06 - over well probably the only other thing
06:08 - I want to go over in this tutorial is
06:11 - this and I'll leave that light green
06:13 - well green looks good enough for now so
06:16 - the only other thing I want to go over
06:18 - is a nice little tip I want to give you
06:20 - actually this is kind of bugging me
06:23 - so if I can go ahead and change that
06:25 - back to White and hit okay it might be
06:28 - easier to see what I'm about to tell you
06:29 - guys whenever you're working with lights
06:32 - you have these little icons right here
06:34 - and I just move that back wow I am a
06:38 - fool Bucky you fool so let's go ahead
06:40 - and put that back and hit F4 again
06:43 - whenever you're working with lights you
06:44 - have these icons right here now what I
06:47 - like to do is I actually like to change
06:50 - the size of the icon depending on how
06:52 - big the light is for example if I'm like
06:54 - lighting up a road or a pathway and I
06:56 - have little kind of like Night Lights
07:00 - uh going on along the sides of it or
07:02 - nice little lights I like to make the
07:04 - icon smaller whenever I have a big light
07:07 - to like symbolize headlights or a big
07:10 - lamp in the room I like to make the icon
07:12 - bigger it just gives me an idea of it
07:15 - just makes it visually easy to
07:17 - understand because when you have a lot
07:18 - of lights it's hard to imagine what
07:20 - lights are affecting the scene in
07:21 - different ways so in order to make this
07:24 - icon bigger or smaller go ahead to the
07:27 - display tab and go ahead to draw scale
07:30 - and now if you scroll this up and down
07:33 - you can see that your icon either
07:34 - shrinks or grows again all this does is
07:38 - change how it visually looks it doesn't
07:40 - change the properties of your light any
07:43 - it just lets the programmer see either a
07:46 - small icon or a big icon and another
07:47 - reason that you might want to change the
07:49 - size is because maybe you have a model
07:51 - of a lamp and you want to fit this icon
07:54 - inside it so it can't be like that big
07:56 - or else look what happens when I try to
07:58 - move it in the lamp it's not going to
08:00 - work out so you might want to you know
08:02 - make it small so you can fit it inside a
08:04 - modeler or something but that's another
08:06 - property that I use a whole bunch and uh
08:09 - if you guys play around with this you'll
08:10 - probably find that you're using it a
08:12 - bunch too but for now I'm am obviously
08:15 - running out of time so in the next
08:16 - tutorial what I'm going to be doing is
08:18 - I'm going to be showing you guys some
08:19 - real cool effects that you can achieve
08:21 - with lights and also probably talking
08:23 - about some of those properties but for
08:24 - now that's all you guys get so thank you
08:26 - guys for watching don't forget to
08:27 - subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
08:28 - next video
