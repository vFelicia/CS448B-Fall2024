00:01 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:04 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:06 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:08 - talking about infinite loops now you're
00:11 - not going to be learning any code in
00:12 - this tutorial I'm just going to be
00:13 - teaching you about something that is
00:15 - somewhat common and something that you
00:18 - need to stay away from when you're
00:19 - programming so let's go ahead and create
00:22 - a new project make sure you have
00:24 - selected console application and we will
00:27 - just call this infinite loops now we
00:33 - will go ahead and click OK now let's
00:36 - zoom in some here okay so basically what
00:43 - an infinite loop is is it's a loop
00:46 - that's going to run forever and it's
00:47 - never going to stop now I'll go ahead
00:50 - and show you an example of an infinite
00:53 - loop so we can go ahead and declare a
00:56 - variable right here dim num1 as integer
01:00 - and we'll set it equal to 10 now we're
01:03 - not actually going to use that right now
01:05 - but I will show you a different example
01:08 - of a an infinite loop so we'll just type
01:13 - do and we're just going to loop while
01:17 - true so basically what this means is
01:20 - that it's going to loop forever because
01:22 - it's always true there's no variable
01:25 - right here there's nothing that could
01:27 - possibly equal false it's always going
01:28 - to equal true and by it I don't it's
01:31 - just there's nothing specified so it's
01:34 - always going to be true it's going to
01:35 - loop forever now that might be a little
01:37 - confusing but it's just for the sake of
01:40 - an example so just to console dot write
01:44 - line let's just do on live gamer and now
01:53 - if we go ahead and run this you can see
01:55 - that it prints on live game over and
01:59 - over and over again now you can see that
02:01 - it doesn't look like there's anything
02:02 - wrong with my program it's running
02:04 - actually quite smoothly and fast but
02:06 - that is all thanks to the dotnet garbage
02:08 - collector now basically what the dotnet
02:10 - garbage collector does is it cleans up
02:12 - old resource
02:13 - is that you aren't using anymore in your
02:15 - program and it keeps it running smoothly
02:19 - and it keeps it from Hawking all of your
02:21 - computer's resources and it's doing a
02:23 - very good job of cleaning up all the
02:25 - stuff left behind by this infinite loop
02:27 - and it's not going to crash the program
02:29 - but in languages for example like Java
02:31 - if you create an infinite loop it's just
02:34 - going to go ahead and crash your program
02:36 - almost instantly now let's go ahead and
02:39 - close out of this and I'll show you a
02:42 - more real-life example of something that
02:45 - you might run into when you're
02:46 - programming so we'll just go ahead and
02:49 - loop while num 1 is greater than 5 let's
02:54 - go ahead and take out this comment right
02:56 - here so that num 1 is actually declared
02:59 - and if we go ahead and run this you can
03:02 - see that it loops forever because num 1
03:05 - is always going to be greater than 5
03:06 - because we didn't increment num 1 during
03:11 - the iterations of the do-while loop so
03:15 - you can see it's just going to run
03:16 - forever and ever and ever and it's not
03:18 - going to stop now we can also just take
03:24 - this statement right here and move it
03:27 - back up here at the top and it will
03:29 - still create a an infinite loop and it's
03:32 - just going to loop forever
03:39 - so thanks for watching guys you didn't
03:41 - learn very much programming in this
03:44 - tutorial actually none at all but this
03:46 - was something that I really wanted to
03:48 - cover in a video and it's something that
03:49 - you'll probably run into quite often and
03:51 - you probably already have and you didn't
03:53 - know what was going on so on go ahead
03:57 - and move on to the next tutorial and
03:59 - thanks for watching
