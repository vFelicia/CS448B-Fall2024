00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:04 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to be learning
00:08 - about properties now what properties do
00:11 - is it's a way of encapsulating data
00:14 - within a class now let's say you have a
00:19 - uh variable that's declared private and
00:21 - it's in another class and you cannot
00:24 - access it what you can do is you can use
00:26 - a property to get that variable and see
00:30 - what it is without directly accessing
00:33 - the data now what this does is let's say
00:36 - you make a property you've got a
00:38 - variable you don't want to change that
00:39 - variable but you want to access it
00:41 - indirectly and have it stored in that
00:43 - property you can create a property get
00:46 - the variable and then if you want to you
00:48 - can set the variable um using that same
00:51 - property so here is the program that we
00:54 - worked on in the last tutorial now I you
00:57 - can see I've changed it a bit here um go
00:59 - ahead and open your toolbox and add a
01:03 - date time picker right here drag that
01:06 - over there and drag a label set the
01:09 - label text to State not
01:11 - initialized and set the name to label
01:16 - State as you can see right here set the
01:19 - datetime Picker name to datetime Picker
01:21 - hour or dtp hour and set the format to
01:27 - time and you can go ahead and resize it
01:29 - some if you want and here is that
01:33 - enumeration that we created last time I
01:35 - added some stuff to it we've got a sleep
01:37 - waking up school lunch home and
01:39 - programming so we'll go ahead and just
01:41 - create a variable of the data type day
01:45 - action so
01:47 - private State
01:50 - as day
01:55 - action okay now what we're going to do
01:57 - is we're going to create our property so
02:00 - we're going to do this by using either
02:02 - the public or private keyword at first
02:04 - we're going to use private so we'll type
02:06 - private and then the keyword
02:10 - property and we have to have a name for
02:12 - it so we'll just call it
02:14 - our and you use empty parameters and
02:17 - you're going to have to specify a data
02:19 - type for it so we'll just make it an
02:21 - integer and if you go ahead and press
02:24 - enter
02:26 - um and type end property
02:32 - okay so now what we need to you do is
02:35 - use what's called a a get
02:38 - statement so the way we do this is we
02:41 - start by typing get and you see when we
02:44 - press enter we get an init and you can
02:47 - see it adds a set um function for us now
02:51 - properties are similar to classes even
02:53 - though I haven't taught you those yet um
02:55 - but they're a lot more efficient you
02:58 - can't do as much but they're more
02:59 - efficient ient and when you want when
03:01 - you can use them use those instead of
03:03 - classes um you'll understand more when
03:06 - we get into classes okay but with a get
03:09 - what we're going to do is we're going to
03:11 - get a variable so we're just going to
03:14 - get the current hour that is displayed
03:17 - on this date time picker so what we do
03:20 - is we
03:21 - type return dtp hour then you type Dot
03:27 - and then you type value
03:30 - and it says gets to set the date time
03:31 - value assigned to the
03:34 - control. hour so what this is going to
03:36 - do is it's just going to get the current
03:38 - hour that is um displayed on the
03:42 - datetime Picker now we could use when we
03:44 - use return it sets property hour equal
03:47 - to um the hour that is on selected on
03:51 - dtp hour we could also type instead of
03:54 - return we could type hour equals dtp
03:58 - hour. Val .
04:01 - hour so we'll just go ahead
04:05 - and put
04:07 - return and now what we're going to do is
04:09 - we have to create a set function you can
04:12 - see it's already created for us and
04:13 - we've got by Val value as integer so
04:18 - whenever somebody calls set they're
04:19 - going to have to give it a value so what
04:22 - we're going to do is we're going to set
04:23 - the date using the hour pass to this
04:25 - property so if they give us an hour
04:29 - We're going to going to set um that hour
04:33 - so we'll just go ahead and type dtp
04:37 - hour. value so what this is going to do
04:40 - is it's going to set the value of dtp
04:42 - hour and we're just going to set that
04:44 - equal to and this is a little
04:46 - introduction to um date and time
04:49 - functions that are built into Visual
04:50 - Basic we'll go more into depth more in
04:52 - depth with those later but for now we're
04:54 - just going to go ahead and create uh a
04:56 - couple little things with it so we'll
04:58 - type new
05:00 - date you can see it says represents an
05:02 - instant in time typically expressed as a
05:05 - date and time of
05:06 - day so date is going to take several
05:11 - arguments so first we're going to set
05:13 - the year so to get the current year
05:16 - we're just going to go ahead and type
05:19 - now and what now is is it's returns to
05:22 - date value containing the current date
05:23 - and time according to your system so
05:25 - whatever their system says it's going to
05:27 - get the year for that so now do
05:31 - year so now what we can do is we can get
05:35 - the month so we'll type now do month and
05:40 - you can see right here that it's giving
05:41 - us a new date and we have three
05:43 - Arguments for this year month and day
05:47 - and we're going to be using a little bit
05:49 - more than that
05:51 - so now we can set the day so we'll type
05:57 - now. day which will give us the
06:01 - um the day of the week or not the day of
06:05 - the week the day in the month so now
06:07 - what we're going to do is we are going
06:09 - to set the current hour and you re you
06:12 - remember that they passed value to the
06:15 - set function so we're just going to go
06:17 - ahead and put value here which is the
06:20 - hour as an integer and we'll set the
06:22 - minute equal to zero and the second
06:25 - equal to zero
06:27 - also so we created a
06:31 - property we got the current hour that is
06:35 - being displayed on the U date time
06:39 - picker then we have a set function that
06:42 - will set the date time picker hour to
06:46 - the specific value that we pass to
06:49 - it so um properties are a lot more
06:52 - confusing than enumerations as I said
06:54 - enumerations might be a little confusing
06:55 - to you in the last tutorial but um we'll
06:58 - talk more about these in the next
07:00 - tutorial and um so if you don't
07:04 - understand this don't practice it yet um
07:06 - you will understand gradually as we go
07:08 - along so thanks for watching and stay
07:10 - tuned for the next video
