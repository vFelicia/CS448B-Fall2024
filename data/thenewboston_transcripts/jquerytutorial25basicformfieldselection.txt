00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new boston
00:04 - in this tutorial we're going to look at
00:07 - creating a very small sample application
00:10 - based on what we've learned about jQuery
00:11 - selectors we're going to be creating a
00:14 - form which allows the background color
00:17 - of each field to change when it's in
00:20 - focus and then when we are out of focus
00:23 - the background color will change back to
00:25 - white so we're creating this and showing
00:28 - I'm essentially showing you how easy it
00:30 - is to create something like this with
00:33 - jQuery selectors and referencing text
00:36 - types so we'll first we'll go ahead and
00:39 - build our form and then I'll go through
00:41 - a bit more about how this works and what
00:43 - we're doing so I'm going to create a
00:45 - form action and I guess the method
00:47 - doesn't really matter and then I'll end
00:50 - the form just here ok so inside I'm
00:53 - going to create a few field so I mean
00:55 - first we're going to say name and we can
00:58 - break down and that's just against
01:01 - around that in paragraph tags so just
01:04 - building up a form that you might
01:05 - usually use on your site
01:07 - now this type is text and that's the
01:10 - selector that we're going to be using in
01:12 - jQuery so let's go ahead and create some
01:15 - more fields will create about three
01:17 - fields we'll say name email and input
01:23 - type equals text and we'll go down and
01:29 - we'll create let's just uh no we'll just
01:32 - leave it at that so almost like a a
01:36 - newsletter submission form I guess so we
01:41 - create our last element which is a
01:43 - button and we can go ahead and give this
01:47 - an ID of news letter button
01:55 - okay so now that we've done this we can
01:57 - go ahead and preview this in our browser
02:00 - let's give that button a value before we
02:03 - go any further so we'll give this a
02:04 - value as sign of sign up okay so now
02:10 - we're in our form there's two things we
02:12 - want to happen we want our text field to
02:17 - change as we either tab down tab back up
02:20 - to them or simply click on them or click
02:22 - on another field and when we click sign
02:25 - up we want this button status or the
02:27 - value of this button to change and then
02:31 - what we want to happen is so the button
02:34 - is disabled so let's go ahead and look
02:38 - at the form fields first now we need to
02:41 - create an event and not an event well we
02:44 - only need to create two event handlers
02:46 - and the first one is focus in and then
02:48 - the last one is blur so we're going to
02:51 - use the blur to change the background
02:54 - color back to white and the focus in is
02:56 - going to change the background color to
02:58 - say yellow for example and we're going
03:00 - to be doing this using the CSS
03:02 - manipulator
03:04 - so inside selectors j/s which we have
03:08 - included down here we want to go ahead
03:10 - and start to create our focus in now
03:14 - we're going to choose the type of text
03:17 - so for every text field on this page
03:20 - which includes this one and this one as
03:24 - well we want to go ahead and change the
03:28 - background color once we've focused in
03:30 - so we use the focus in event handler and
03:34 - then inside here we create a function we
03:39 - pull that just down a bit and then we
03:41 - can start writing the code when we focus
03:43 - in so we want to select this dot CSS
03:49 - remember this will refer back to the
03:51 - current field itself if we were to for
03:55 - example do text then despite the fact
04:01 - that we may be clicking on this field
04:04 - both of them would then
04:07 - apply the CSS action we've specified
04:10 - here so we only want it to happen to the
04:13 - current field that we are and we have
04:16 - clicked on or the current field that
04:18 - we've tabbed down to so the current
04:20 - field that we focused into essentially
04:23 - so we supply the CSS function with two
04:27 - parameters the first one is the part of
04:31 - the element that we want to change so
04:33 - background color
