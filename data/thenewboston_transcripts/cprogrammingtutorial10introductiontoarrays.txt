00:00 - what's up guys welcome back to your 10th
00:02 - tutorial and in this tutorial we're
00:04 - going to be covering something called an
00:06 - array a r r a y that's probably going to
00:11 - be at the title at the top of the screen
00:12 - but you know I like spelling things so
00:14 - there you have it so you're saying all
00:16 - right Bucky that's a pretty cool word
00:19 - but what the heck is an array well let
00:21 - me break it down to you guys real simple
00:24 - don't even read any definitions online
00:26 - or else they're just going to confuse
00:27 - though with all their technical talk all
00:30 - in Array is it's a
00:32 - variable that holds multiple values so
00:36 - for example before we said like int X
00:39 - was equal to 17 well now what we can do
00:43 - is instead of just one number in there
00:45 - we can store multiple numbers or values
00:49 - in there pretty confusing huh so let's
00:52 - go ahead and let's see an example right
00:53 - now let me give myself some space and
00:56 - let's go ahead and make an integer well
00:59 - before before I even start typing let me
01:01 - tell you guys how to create an array in
01:05 - order to create an array they're all
01:08 - made basically the same way the first
01:11 - thing you do is type what type of data
01:14 - you're going to be storing in this array
01:15 - let's just keep it simple and store
01:17 - integers in it whole numbers next you
01:20 - give your array a cool name and we're
01:22 - going to give this array the coolest
01:24 - name of all which is bacon you know
01:26 - besides from Bucky because that's pretty
01:28 - dang cool and after you write the name
01:31 - of your array in square brackets you
01:35 - write how many values you want that
01:37 - array to store so let's go ahead and
01:40 - make a relatively small one we're only
01:42 - store five values in here won't uh take
01:45 - too much of a toll on our processor so
01:48 - go ahead and just like variables set it
01:50 - to equal sign and now we need to set it
01:52 - equal to multiple values so what your
01:56 - computer needs to do is it needs to
01:58 - recognize where these values are so go
02:01 - ahead and go ahead and put these I don't
02:03 - even know what the heck these things are
02:05 - called Curly brackets or curly braces I
02:07 - think uh I don't know whatever those
02:10 - things are called and and your line so
02:13 - inside these curly braces this is where
02:16 - you write your five values integer
02:19 - values separated with the comma so let's
02:22 - go ahead and type in any five values 12
02:25 - uh 43 54 3 and 800 97 so check this out
02:32 - again to recap in order to create array
02:35 - here's what you do what type of data is
02:38 - going to be stored in it these are
02:40 - integers what is the name of your array
02:42 - you can name it whatever heck you want I
02:43 - just name this bacon and how
02:46 - many items are in it and by the way the
02:49 - technical term for these items are
02:51 - elements I call them items some people
02:54 - call them elements technically they're
02:56 - elements but whatever I'll use them
02:58 - interchangeably deal with it so check
03:02 - this out you know how before whenever we
03:04 - wanted to use a variable like C out we
03:07 - would just print out the variable's name
03:09 - like this bacon well how on Earth are we
03:13 - going to reference this array and get to
03:15 - the values in it if it has like multiple
03:17 - values wow this is going to be super
03:20 - confusing right wrong check this out
03:23 - anytime you want to access any element
03:26 - in Array all you have to do is type the
03:28 - name of the array
03:30 - and write what index it is so let's go
03:35 - ahead and see an example and you're
03:36 - going to see something a little weird
03:38 - but stick with me let's go ahead and put
03:41 - bacon 2 and print out and see what we
03:43 - get run this and we get 54 now let's
03:48 - scroll this down and check this out all
03:50 - right 12 is first 43 is second and 54 is
03:56 - third so how come when I type two I got
03:59 - 54
04:00 - instead of 43 well check this out in
04:03 - computer language they love to start
04:06 - with zero you know binary code is all
04:09 - zeros and ones whenever you learned
04:11 - counting as a kid you started with one
04:14 - but whoever the heck built computers
04:17 - whenever they learn counting as a kid
04:20 - they evidently must have started at zero
04:22 - because in computer programming whenever
04:24 - you count anything it always starts with
04:27 - zero so that is why when you reference
04:29 - two that this is actually the second
04:33 - index because it goes like this 12 is 0
04:37 - 43 is 1 54 is 2 three is four or excuse
04:45 - me three well that's confusing three is
04:48 - three and 897 is four so let's go ahead
04:53 - and change this to um four and remember
04:57 - since it starts at 0 0 1 2 3 4 this is
05:01 - actually going to print out 897 right
05:05 - here check it out 897 so how cool is
05:08 - that so anyways that is what an array is
05:11 - pretty much a variable that can store
05:13 - multiple values and how to access each
05:16 - individual element in the
05:18 - array is you type in the name of the
05:22 - array which is bacon and then you type
05:25 - where what index you want to print out
05:27 - so zero would print out out 12 let's
05:30 - just go ahead and see that 12 and if we
05:33 - did something crazy like um five let's
05:37 - go ahead and build and run that and we
05:39 - get some weird error and this is uh
05:42 - actually looks like a number but this is
05:44 - actually a space in memory it's pretty
05:46 - much an error so that is because it goes
05:49 - 0 1 2 3 4 and five doesn't exist so it's
05:55 - going to just print out the memory
05:56 - location of it but that's like in that's
05:59 - like like 40 tutorials away from now
06:01 - just notice that whenever you go outside
06:03 - of rray you get error message so anyways
06:06 - that's the basics of an array in the
06:09 - next tutorial I'm going to show you guys
06:10 - a different way to build an array other
06:13 - than this so you definitely want to
06:15 - stick around and I know just printing
06:18 - out variables on the screen right now is
06:20 - going to seem really useless but trust
06:22 - me whenever we come across building a
06:25 - program that uses an array in a useful
06:28 - manner you're going to see how useful
06:29 - these things really are it's actually
06:32 - incredibly amazing trust me you guys are
06:34 - going to be amazed so anyways thank you
06:36 - guys for watching don't forget subscrib
06:37 - and I'll see you guys later
