00:00 - what's going on guys welcome to your
00:01 - 21st C++ tutorial and before I even get
00:04 - started with the story I just want to
00:06 - mention one thing that you guys probably
00:07 - notice already and that is I don't have
00:09 - return 0 at the end of my main and that
00:12 - is because I just found out that well
00:15 - let me say this in the old C++ ways you
00:18 - had to have that return 0 statement but
00:21 - now the new version or whatever whenever
00:24 - you don't include return 0 at the end of
00:27 - your main C++ just assumes you return 0
00:30 - after the last statement so you know if
00:33 - you go ahead and type your program you
00:35 - can either put it if you're you know
00:37 - old-school programmer or you cannot
00:39 - include it and it would just assume you
00:40 - have return 0 but for the rest of these
00:42 - stories I'm going to exclude it so you
00:45 - know don't forget that it isn't there so
00:47 - anyways let's go ahead and get to the
00:48 - heart of the story and that's assignment
00:50 - operators and increment operators now we
00:53 - already know well let's go ahead and get
00:54 - a variable first set X equal to 10 looks
00:58 - good so we already know we can do
01:01 - something like this X plus equals 10 and
01:04 - this is basically the same as writing x
01:07 - equals x plus 10 so then whenever we let
01:10 - me just go ahead and this line and print
01:13 - it out we go ahead and we get 20 just
01:16 - like that so what it does is it takes to
01:18 - this value adds it to X and sets equal
01:22 - to the new X variable so I already told
01:24 - you guys plus equals is a shortcut I
01:26 - also want to go over all of them so when
01:28 - you see them in program you don't get
01:30 - confused X well let's change this to 5
01:32 - it's weird if they're the same number so
01:34 - X minus equal 5 equals 10 minus 5 and
01:38 - assigns that to the new value of x so
01:40 - let's go ahead and see that that is 5
01:42 - now if we go ahead and see multiplies
01:46 - equals what this would do is do 10 times
01:50 - 5 and set it equal to 50 and the last
01:53 - one without getting in the weird stuff
01:56 - is divide equals 5 and this of course is
01:59 - 2 so what this does is basically takes
02:01 - the old value of x it divides it by this
02:04 - value and sets it equal to the new value
02:07 - of x so aside from that there's one more
02:10 - and I rarely use it
02:12 - this way I hate writing in like this and
02:14 - I hate seeing other people rate it like
02:16 - this because it's confusing this is
02:18 - going to be a bad example because ten
02:20 - divided by five is two with no remainder
02:22 - so it will be zero but if we go ahead
02:24 - and throw like three something like this
02:26 - what this does is it takes the old value
02:28 - of X divides it by three and it stores
02:32 - the remainder in one so now X is going
02:34 - to be equal to one right like that so
02:38 - those are all your assignment operators
02:41 - plus minus multiply divide and modulus
02:44 - which is remainder so now whenever you
02:47 - come across them in programming you'll
02:48 - understand what they mean so now what I
02:51 - want to talk to you guys about is those
02:52 - increment operators so let's go ahead
02:54 - and get new value 20 that's a little bit
02:56 - better it's my favorite number so you
02:58 - know how I told you guys that you could
03:01 - do something like this X plus plus and
03:03 - this was the same thing as adding one to
03:06 - X
03:06 - simple enough right not exactly because
03:09 - there are two different versions of this
03:11 - increment operator and I'm going to show
03:13 - you the difference with little
03:15 - differences between both so let's go
03:17 - ahead and see out X n line let's go
03:23 - ahead and run this and take a look at
03:24 - what happens so our initial value of X
03:27 - was equal to 20 and then we ran this
03:29 - line of code and it printed 20 all right
03:32 - and then we ran this line and it was
03:34 - equal to 21 well what the increment
03:37 - operator is doing whenever you write
03:39 - variable with plus plus after it it's
03:42 - going to go ahead and run this line of
03:44 - code and then it's going to add 1 to
03:47 - that variable so runs this line of code
03:49 - X is still 20 then when it gets done
03:52 - running it assigns 21 to X and then it
03:55 - runs this one so that's why it was 20 21
03:59 - so saying are a simple enough what's the
04:01 - other version the other version is this
04:04 - whenever the increment operator is
04:06 - before the variable like plus plus X
04:09 - instead of X plus plus what happens is
04:12 - you can see whenever you run the program
04:14 - it goes 21 21 so what this does before
04:18 - the variable is it adds one first and
04:21 - then it runs the statement so adds one
04:23 - right here and then
04:25 - runs it so right here the value of X is
04:28 - getting set to 21 and then run it 21
04:31 - still 21 21 so it's basically if your
04:34 - pluses are before the X it's going to
04:36 - add one before it runs it if your pluses
04:39 - are after the X it's going to run the
04:41 - line of code and then add one to the
04:43 - variable so it you know if you're
04:45 - building a program in you're off by one
04:48 - you know maybe you're running a loop or
04:50 - something and you're always off by one
04:51 - chances are your pluses are on the wrong
04:53 - side either this side or that side so
04:56 - this is a common error and it's actually
04:58 - something that people have a hard
04:59 - concept understanding but just remember
05:02 - where you add your pluses indicate when
05:05 - it's going to add one before or after
05:08 - the statement and if you remember like
05:09 - that it'll be simple enough so now you
05:12 - understand that you don't need a return
05:14 - zero
05:14 - you understand all these scuse me ooh
05:17 - assignment operators that's actually
05:19 - kind of a tongue-twister assignment
05:21 - operators assignment operators just
05:23 - hyman operators got it and now you
05:26 - understand increment operators which is
05:27 - plus plus X and X plus plus oh and one
05:30 - other thing
05:31 - there's also minus minus X and what this
05:33 - does of course is subtracts it and X
05:37 - minus minus but I don't need to show you
05:39 - guys that
05:39 - so just remember those four different
05:41 - increment operators all those assignment
05:42 - operators and you don't need a return
05:44 - zero anymore and you'll be good to go so
05:46 - thank you guys for watching my twenty
05:47 - first tutorial no idea what I'm going to
05:50 - cover in the next tutorial but it's
05:51 - going to be sweet so thank you guys
05:52 - again and I will see you guys later
