00:00 - all right guys welcome back to your 70th
00:02 - tutorial and this tutorial really isn't
00:04 - a tutorial at all we're just going to be
00:06 - running the program that we built in the
00:07 - last two tutorials and I actually did
00:09 - check for errors in the last video and
00:12 - this program is built perfectly who
00:14 - would have guessed and so it's ready to
00:17 - run so let me go ahead and press this
00:19 - build and run and it show you guys how
00:21 - it works so the very first thing it does
00:23 - is pop up a menu and it gives us a
00:25 - choice press one to print out plain
00:28 - items two for helpful items press three
00:30 - to print out harmful items and whenever
00:32 - you want to creit the program press four
00:34 - so let's go ahead and print out one and
00:37 - this is going to print out the items
00:38 - that have no effect on our character so
00:40 - press one go ahead and hit enter and
00:42 - it's going to print out chair a shoe and
00:45 - a pencil all with Zero Effect on our
00:47 - character so now let's go ahead and
00:50 - let's skip down to you know three or
00:51 - something hit three enter and it's going
00:54 - to print out ninja meth and a dirty
00:57 - needle so now let's go ahead and print
01:00 - uh two and whenever we hit two to print
01:03 - out the helpful items it's going to
01:04 - print out fruit candy and soda and now
01:07 - let's go ahead and press four to quit
01:08 - the program and our program is going to
01:10 - end with execution time of 49 seconds
01:13 - how awesome is that so one thing that I
01:15 - want to do because it's just going to
01:16 - annoy me is I want to add a new line
01:18 - right there and right there so now
01:21 - whenever you run the program it's going
01:23 - to you know it just makes everything not
01:26 - bunched up into one line so if you go
01:27 - ahead and hit two you can see that you
01:30 - know it makes it a little bit better so
01:32 - again there's a lot of different
01:33 - formatting things that we can do but you
01:36 - know I just want to make sure it wasn't
01:37 - bunched together so two prints out all
01:39 - the helpful items um if I go ahead and
01:42 - you know hit three it'll print out all
01:43 - the harmful items yada yada yada so
01:46 - basically I want to just show you guys
01:48 - that this program does indeed work I
01:50 - wasn't bsing you and uh this is how you
01:53 - can build a program that works awesomely
01:55 - with a file in this
01:57 - case the object file or the objects.
02:01 - text file so let me guys let me talk you
02:03 - through how this program works one last
02:06 - time the very first thing I want to
02:08 - mention is whenever you're building a
02:10 - program that takes a bunch of different
02:12 - functions make sure to prototype your
02:14 - functions first and foremost if you
02:16 - don't prototype your functions like this
02:19 - and try to run it you're going to get an
02:20 - error message because it's going to come
02:22 - across this function and it's not going
02:23 - to understand what it means so that's
02:25 - why you need to prototype your function
02:27 - so once you have your functions
02:28 - prototype let me run this get that error
02:30 - message out of the way now that you have
02:32 - your function prototype I'll tell you
02:34 - guys how this program works the very
02:36 - first thing we wanted to do was display
02:39 - a menu to the user and we wanted them to
02:42 - enter a number 1 2 3 or 4 depending on
02:45 - their menu choice so what we did is we
02:48 - built a function to display that menu
02:50 - named get what they
02:52 - want and we took whatever they entered
02:54 - and we stored it in variable called
02:56 - choice and what this did function did is
02:59 - it returned that variable choice so it
03:01 - basically stored that uh number either 1
03:04 - 2 3 or 4 in the variable what they want
03:07 - because this number tells us what they
03:10 - want so after that we took that number
03:13 - and we first made sure it wasn't equal
03:15 - to four because remember four means they
03:18 - want to quit the program so whenever
03:20 - they entered four this wall Loop ended
03:23 - in the program quit so what this Wallop
03:25 - did is said all right if they enter any
03:28 - number besides four go ahead and run
03:31 - this code right here because that means
03:32 - that they want something if they enter
03:34 - one it means they want plain items two
03:37 - helpful items three harmful items so I
03:39 - said all right test this variable if
03:42 - they entered one two or three if they
03:44 - entered one called this function in
03:47 - display items with the parameter one if
03:50 - they enter two it means they want
03:52 - helpful items so we're going to call
03:54 - display helpful items and if they enter
03:57 - three we're going to pass in three on
03:59 - this display items function so you're
04:01 - saying all right so the display item
04:03 - function obviously displays the proper
04:06 - items to them so say we passed it the
04:08 - variable two well it calls the display
04:12 - items function with the parameter two it
04:15 - basically Scrolls down here and calls
04:16 - display items now remember display items
04:19 - it just prints out something on the
04:21 - screen it doesn't give us any integers
04:23 - or strings back so we made that void now
04:25 - whenever we passed in one two or three
04:28 - it treated that variable as is X so X
04:31 - was pretty much their choice 1 2 or
04:33 - three so the very first thing that we
04:36 - did in this function is we opened that
04:38 - file because I mean all the crap that we
04:40 - needed was inside this file so we opened
04:43 - that file and then we made two variables
04:45 - we made a name
04:47 - variable to store the name of the object
04:50 - and we made a power variable to store
04:53 - how much power that object had whether
04:55 - it's zero negative or positive we then
04:58 - tested what Cho choice they wanted
05:01 - remember if x which is now the choice is
05:04 - equal to one then it means they want to
05:06 - display the items with no power the
05:10 - plain items whenever they entered the
05:13 - number two it means they wanted to
05:15 - display the helpful items and helpful
05:17 - items just had a power greater than zero
05:20 - so that's why we printed out the objects
05:22 - with a power greater than zero whenever
05:25 - they entered the number three it means
05:27 - they wanted to display the harmful items
05:29 - the it that hurt our character so we're
05:31 - said all right we're going to test this
05:33 - power variable and any object with a
05:36 - power variable that's less than zero go
05:38 - ahead and print it out so that is how
05:41 - our program works and here's what I'm
05:44 - going to ask one of you guys to do um
05:46 - you guys probably want all the source
05:48 - code for this so actually what I'm going
05:50 - to do is I'm going to go ahead and copy
05:52 - this and post it in my Forum under the
05:54 - C++ section so if you guys want just go
05:58 - ahead and um sign up actually you don't
06:00 - even need to sign up for my Forum but I
06:02 - would prefer you did sign up for my
06:04 - Forum go look in the C++ section and
06:07 - I'll post all the source code here so if
06:08 - you guys you know are getting an error
06:11 - in your program whenever you're working
06:12 - along you can just go ahead and copy my
06:14 - source code and uh it's all there for
06:16 - you guys so thank you guys for watching
06:18 - so much hopefully you understand how
06:19 - this program works if you don't
06:21 - understand then don't flip out all you
06:23 - need to do is go ahead look at the
06:25 - source code and once you see it all
06:27 - together um you guys can understand
06:29 - understand how it's all pieced together
06:31 - so again one last time this is how you
06:33 - build a program that works perfectly
06:36 - with a file just like this and with that
06:40 - being said um I want to say this a lot
06:43 - of well in this tutorial I showed you
06:45 - guys how to have the user you know input
06:48 - a number and print out all the helpful
06:50 - items or harmful items but in whenever
06:52 - you're developing a game instead of just
06:54 - printing it out on the screen you would
06:57 - want you know whenever your user comes
06:59 - across a helpful item to you know make
07:03 - them get that much energy or whenever
07:06 - your character comes across a harmful
07:07 - item have them you know take that much
07:10 - energy away from your character or
07:12 - whenever your character comes across an
07:15 - item like a building or a chair or a
07:16 - shoe it has no effect on the character
07:19 - so aside from printing it out we would
07:21 - do something different in this line of
07:23 - code right here but that's basically um
07:26 - your very first glance at how games in
07:29 - programs work at files in a useful
07:31 - program so I'm glad I could teach this
07:34 - tutorial finally make a program that's
07:36 - useful instead of teaching guys just the
07:38 - Core Concepts I know a lot of you guys
07:40 - were complaining that I was just
07:42 - teaching you the concepts and you guys
07:43 - never really got to see how a program
07:45 - was put together so hopefully here's a
07:47 - nice little uh look at how it works so
07:50 - thank you guys for watching One Last
07:51 - Time uh thank you guys so much for
07:53 - subscribing and I'm excited to move on
07:56 - to the next topic so hopefully we're
07:57 - done working with files at least for now
07:59 - so thank you guys for watching and I'll
08:00 - see you guys in the next video
