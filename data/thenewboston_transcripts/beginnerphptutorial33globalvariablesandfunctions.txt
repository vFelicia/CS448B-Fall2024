00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:02 - and this is another video tutorial for
00:04 - the new Boston now in this tutorial I'm
00:07 - going to be talking about global
00:09 - variables and using them inside
00:11 - functions now you may come across the
00:14 - problem that when you're pre defining
00:16 - variables outside of your functions and
00:18 - you're trying to use them within your
00:19 - functions you might find that you're not
00:23 - getting any sort of response from this
00:25 - your the variable will not you know you
00:29 - might be able to do anything with it so
00:30 - let's use the example with an IP address
00:36 - let's create the user's IP address
00:41 - inside a variable so we're going to say
00:45 - structure it like this now don't worry
00:49 - if you don't understand this code if
00:51 - you've never seen this part of the code
00:52 - before all this does is it returns the
00:55 - user's IP address server it's just a
00:58 - preset of environmental variables that
01:00 - we can use so let's just echo this out
01:03 - as it is and then we'll see about
01:06 - creating a function that's going to do
01:08 - something with this IP address what
01:09 - we're going to just be doing is echoing
01:11 - it out but we're going to be doing that
01:12 - inside a function so let's refresh now
01:15 - because I'm on a local on my local host
01:17 - local server I'm working on my computer
01:20 - my IP address is just 1.1 27.0 dot 0 dot
01:24 - 1 which is the standard notation for a
01:26 - local server now what happens if I
01:29 - create a function down here let's say an
01:33 - echo IP and inside here I just want to
01:38 - echo out use
01:39 - now you can imagine in a normal program
01:42 - that you've created however simple or
01:43 - complex it's going to be wherever you
01:45 - echo this variable out or wherever you
01:48 - do something with this variable for
01:50 - example we might say um let's say string
01:54 - equals your IP address is
02:00 - and then we can catenate the user IP on
02:03 - the end of their let's just use this
02:04 - outside the function first of all or you
02:07 - can keep that in the X we're not going
02:08 - to call the function yet let's just use
02:10 - this outside of here and we can yet just
02:13 - echo that out so let's have a look at
02:15 - what it says so we've got your IP
02:17 - address is and then it gives us the IP
02:18 - address let's just put a space there
02:21 - okay so this works you would expect it
02:23 - to work because you've referenced the
02:25 - variable here okay so now what happens
02:28 - if we do this inside a function so I've
02:30 - created the string your IP address is
02:32 - and then I'm going to echo out the
02:33 - string so what you'd expect to happen is
02:36 - for the variable here to be put into
02:39 - here so that will make up this string
02:41 - and then we're echoing out the string so
02:43 - let's refresh the page and see what
02:45 - happens
02:49 - okay so we haven't actually called our
02:52 - function so that's one vital thing I
02:53 - forgot so I'm calling the function down
02:55 - here so presumably once we call the
02:57 - function the two lines of highlighted in
02:59 - blue will be run so let's try this out
03:03 - okay now you'll notice that the string
03:05 - itself has actually been echoed out
03:09 - however the user IP has not but for
03:16 - example if we echo it out out here it
03:20 - still does exist so we're still echoing
03:23 - out this variable still you know holds a
03:26 - value however what's happening here is
03:28 - we're not being able to access it inside
03:31 - this function and there's one simple
03:34 - line of code that you can use to do this
03:36 - and you can put multiple variables
03:38 - within this but now we're just going to
03:41 - be working with one so all we need to do
03:44 - is specify the global keyword and then
03:48 - reference the variable number that we
03:50 - want to make global to this function so
03:52 - global user IP now what will happen is
03:56 - this variable will be able to be picked
03:58 - up from out here and then therefore it
04:00 - will be put into there let's refresh and
04:05 - you can see that it works
04:06 - we are echoing out this string the user
04:08 - IP has been gained from this value here
04:11 - like I said you can do multiple
04:14 - things so if you had say another
04:15 - variable here and another one here you
04:20 - can just separate them by commas so why
04:23 - would we need to do this the answer is
04:28 - simple you might have lots of either
04:31 - static or dynamic variables that you
04:33 - have to define outside for example you
04:35 - might have to define it in an include
04:38 - file you might be including a different
04:40 - file that contains this user IP so to be
04:44 - able to use it inside your function you
04:46 - want to create it and globally first in
04:49 - inside your function and then it will be
04:51 - able to be used so for example this IP
04:54 - this IP address situation we might want
04:57 - to define it somewhere else we might not
04:59 - want to define it within our function
05:01 - because you could in fact just to find
05:05 - it inside and it would still that's just
05:08 - right it would still work so we're still
05:11 - getting exactly the same result from
05:13 - this when we refresh however what
05:15 - happens if we want to use this user IP
05:17 - now outside the function we're going to
05:19 - have to declare it again so it's a waste
05:22 - of you know declaring a function inside
05:25 - the function at outside so we tend to
05:28 - just use the notation that I've
05:30 - explained and that will allow your
05:34 - outsider phone function variable to be
05:37 - used within
