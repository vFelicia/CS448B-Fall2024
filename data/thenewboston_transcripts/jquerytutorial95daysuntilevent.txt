00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:03 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this video we're gonna be using
00:07 - jQuery now to retrieve a current time so
00:11 - we can match it against an event or a
00:13 - time in the future and and display to
00:15 - the user how many days until this
00:17 - particular event so essentially what
00:20 - we're doing is we're allowing the user
00:21 - or in the backend of our script in ext
00:24 - is we're allowing ourselves of someone
00:27 - else to set a textual representation of
00:29 - a time we're then going to use jQuery
00:31 - now to return the current time and we're
00:33 - gonna work out the amount of days
00:35 - between now and the event so we're going
00:38 - a little bit over the top here with
00:39 - regards to what we're creating but this
00:42 - will demonstrate jQuery now and the use
00:45 - for this quite nicely so the first thing
00:48 - I want to go ahead and do is create an
00:49 - area on my page that I'm actually going
00:51 - to display the amount of days remaining
00:54 - so for example this might say let's say
01:00 - five days remaining if I could spell it
01:06 - bright or only five days until this
01:09 - event I guess we could say that's what
01:12 - we wanted to say this is what we want it
01:14 - to display on the page only five days
01:16 - until this event so we're replacing this
01:19 - with the amount of days hmm okay so what
01:22 - we're gonna go ahead and do is we're not
01:24 - gonna write anything inside of this div
01:26 - we're gonna let ext jus handle
01:28 - absolutely everything so inside my index
01:33 - dot PHP I've obviously included jQuery
01:35 - extremely important because we're using
01:36 - jQuery now and ext dot J is the file
01:41 - that we're gonna handle everything in
01:42 - and that's gonna place the text inside
01:45 - of this div here so the first thing we
01:48 - want to go ahead and do is wait for the
01:49 - document to be ready so I'm gonna say
01:51 - document dot ready
01:53 - so this ear here selector refers to the
01:56 - document itself and this refers to the
01:59 - fact that the it was an event handler
02:01 - refers to when the document is ready and
02:04 - we can start to manipulate things and
02:08 - and you know do things about this is
02:10 - almost instant instant but we tend to do
02:14 - this in jQuery every time we write code
02:16 - okay so now what we're doing is we're
02:18 - creating a function inside of here and
02:20 - inside of the block I'm just going to
02:21 - pull that down so we can start writing
02:23 - our code now the first thing we want to
02:27 - go ahead and do is set a time for our
02:29 - event and this is going to be a string
02:31 - which we're going to supply for example
02:33 - 12th of August 2011 its 8th of August
02:37 - 2011 today so that's about three days to
02:41 - that event so we'll use this as an
02:43 - example I'm going to go ahead and create
02:45 - a variable called event time and this is
02:50 - going to be equal to a string so let's
02:53 - just go ahead and say 12th of August
02:56 - 2011
02:58 - now whatever first of all want to do is
03:00 - wrap this in the past functionality of
03:04 - date now this isn't really anything to
03:06 - do with jQuery it's to do with
03:08 - JavaScript and but we obviously
03:10 - sometimes still need to use JavaScript
03:12 - jQuery doesn't include some
03:14 - functionality because Jake JavaScript
03:16 - does it on its own well and you don't
03:18 - need a library for it so we're using
03:20 - date dot pass and we're wrapping that
03:23 - like that let's go ahead and just alert
03:26 - this event time out so we can see what
03:28 - we are displayed with let's press f5 now
03:33 - you'll notice there's a number of sort
03:36 - of trailing zeros afterwards what we
03:41 - actually want is we want this to be
03:44 - without the milliseconds afterwards the
03:46 - the zero is the trailing zeros that you
03:48 - see are the milliseconds so what we want
03:51 - to go ahead and do is divide this by a
03:52 - thousand and then we get a
03:55 - presentation of this date in seconds
03:57 - rather than with the milliseconds at the
04:00 - end so this is a lot more helpful
04:03 - because we don't really need to
04:04 - calculate milliseconds okay so now we're
04:07 - going to go and write the or apply the
04:10 - current time to a variable and the value
04:13 - in there so I'm gonna say current time
04:17 - is equal to let's just have these over
04:20 - it's a bit neater what we're gonna say
04:24 - so current time is equal to jQuery dot
04:27 - now as we've seen and again we need to
04:30 - divide this by a thousand because if we
04:32 - were to go ahead and just alert current
04:35 - time on its own and let's go ahead and
04:39 - refresh you see that we've got these
04:40 - milliseconds as well afterwards which
04:42 - change obviously quite rapidly so we
04:44 - don't really want to be counting
04:46 - milliseconds so let's go ahead and
04:47 - divide that by a thousand as well and
04:50 - now we get a representation of the of
04:53 - the time here the only problem is is
04:57 - that we are not flooring this data
05:01 - ideally we want to remove the the what's
05:07 - it called after the decimal point the
05:08 - decimal we want to remove anything in
05:10 - that you know after the decimal point
05:12 - basically we want to round down so I
05:15 - want to say math.floor and wrap that in
05:18 - there and we could do the same for the
05:20 - event time as well I don't know how it
05:24 - handles this but we'll leave it for now
05:25 - because it will work fine without okay
05:27 - so what I'm gonna go ahead and do now is
05:29 - I'm gonna work out the amount of seconds
05:31 - between these two events now because
05:34 - we're returning them both our seconds
05:36 - this is quite straightforward so the
05:38 - amount of seconds between the two events
05:40 - is simply the event time minus the
05:44 - current time and then we have the
05:46 - difference in seconds between the two
05:48 - events so let's go ahead and alert out
05:52 - seconds
05:54 - and that's refresh and you can see that
05:55 - this is the amount of seconds between
05:57 - the two events and obviously that will
05:59 - keep you know changing in value okay so
06:04 - now what we want to go ahead and do is
06:06 - calculate these days so to calculate the
06:10 - days we want to take the seconds
06:11 - and we want to divide it by 60 times 60
06:14 - times 24 okay so let's go ahead and
06:18 - alert out days and we'll go ahead and
06:23 - refresh and you can see that we've got
06:25 - three days here but we've got point and
06:27 - we've got a lot of decimal places
06:29 - afterwards so we can go ahead and use
06:31 - math top-floor here as well and this
06:33 - will just return a value of three so
06:36 - let's go ahead and wrap this in math dot
06:38 - floor
06:40 - and once we've done that and we alert
06:43 - days out you can see that we've just got
06:44 - three so now we've successfully
06:46 - retrieved the amount of days and all
06:49 - that's really left to do is go ahead and
06:50 - place it inside this day's div here so
06:53 - we'll go ahead and do that now we're
06:54 - gonna use a jQuery selector to select
06:56 - days div with the ID of days remember
07:00 - use a hash to select the ID and we want
07:03 - to go ahead and play some text in here
07:04 - and that text is only X days until the
07:09 - event and with X we'll just go ahead and
07:14 - concatenate on this day's variable that
07:17 - we've created here so now when we
07:20 - refresh we get only three days until the
07:21 - event now obviously let's go ahead and
07:24 - just I'm just gonna tidy this up because
07:26 - that's just what I'm like but we'll go
07:28 - ahead and maybe change this to 20th of
07:31 - August and when we refresh you see
07:33 - you've got eleven days until the event
07:35 - let's go ahead and change this to 2015
07:39 - and you'll see we've got only one
07:42 - thousand four hundred and seventy two
07:43 - days until the event so using jQuery now
07:47 - and I think the rest are certainly these
07:51 - two lines here this line here
07:55 - are both playing JavaScript however this
07:58 - line here obviously uses jQuery now I
08:03 - think we can go ahead and use a dollar
08:05 - sign here actually that was just check
08:06 - yeah we can we can use a dollar sign
08:09 - here instead of jQuery we don't need to
08:11 - use the jQuery notation also this line
08:15 - overseas is jQuery but essentially what
08:17 - we've done is used now to grab the
08:18 - current time flawed it and then worked
08:20 - out the amount of days so even if you
08:23 - know you didn't learn too much about the
08:24 - now functionality and jQuery you've
08:27 - learned how to retrieve an amount of
08:28 - days to an event so that's about it
08:31 - we've got only one thousand four hundred
08:33 - seventy two days until the event that we
08:35 - specified quite easy piece of code and
08:37 - also quite effective and useful if you
08:41 - are required to use it at all
