00:00 - hello this is Alex from PHP academy' and
00:03 - this is a video tutorial created for the
00:06 - new Boston now in this tutorial I'm
00:08 - going to be talking about time stamps in
00:10 - PHP now time stamps are a widely used
00:15 - standard that has been utilized by PHP
00:18 - in order to keep track of the current
00:21 - time the current day and in fact we have
00:24 - functions that can retrieve say a date
00:27 - and a week or so or we could go with
00:29 - just things like that now a time stamp
00:32 - is a numerical value of the amount of
00:37 - seconds so it's an integer value of the
00:39 - amount of seconds from the first of
00:41 - January 1970 so for an example let's
00:45 - just echo out time we're going to echo
00:49 - out time and this is a function that
00:51 - returns the current unix timestamp so
00:55 - let's come into our page here and
00:56 - refresh and we can see that we're giving
00:58 - given a large integer value now this
01:01 - value here that you see is in fact the
01:03 - amount of seconds from the first of
01:06 - January 1970 now if you watch carefully
01:09 - at the end here we've got 75 let's
01:11 - refresh the page and see what changes
01:13 - you can see it's changed to 90 now if we
01:16 - do that again we're going to 94 and if I
01:19 - gradually refresh it say every one
01:21 - second you can see that this value keeps
01:23 - incrementing so it's really useful to
01:26 - keep track of the amount of seconds or
01:30 - sorry of the current time depending on
01:34 - you know the account depending on how
01:37 - you process this value at the moment if
01:40 - I was to say I uploaded a file or a
01:43 - process to comment or I just did
01:47 - anything on a webpage that would require
01:49 - me or the functionality would be there
01:53 - to tell me when I did it for example
01:55 - let's say I did post a comment I might
01:57 - want to create my website to show when
02:00 - the comment was posted now if you were
02:02 - showing you used as this value they
02:04 - wouldn't really make much sense of it
02:05 - I could say for example
02:10 - the echo the current time is um and then
02:18 - I append the time on to the end of that
02:20 - if i refresh and this is really onions
02:24 - not user-friendly at all
02:26 - because what we're doing is we're
02:27 - showing we are showing the time in terms
02:30 - of from a certain day in it within
02:33 - seconds we're not actually displaying in
02:35 - a human readable form so how can we how
02:38 - can we change this well let's just get
02:40 - rid of that for now and let's go up here
02:43 - and create a variable called time and
02:45 - give it the current timestamp now down
02:47 - here what we can actually do is we can
02:49 - create a new variable called actual time
02:51 - and we can proce this process this using
02:54 - the date function now the date function
02:56 - works with x as well and it takes two
02:58 - arguments the first argument is how you
03:00 - want it to be displayed that will go in
03:02 - here and we have keys of different
03:04 - things to use this and then the second
03:09 - argument is the is a timestamp so I'm
03:11 - going to type in time which is obviously
03:12 - our current timestamp here so I'm using
03:15 - this date function to process our
03:17 - timestamp and show it correctly so
03:20 - obviously after this we wrap we're going
03:21 - to show the actual date so we can append
03:23 - that on there now at the moment nothing
03:26 - is going to happen if we refresh you can
03:28 - see that it's blank
03:30 - because we've taken the timestamp but we
03:32 - haven't actually processed it in a way
03:33 - now the most common way would be to do H
03:36 - a small I and a capital s this is just
03:39 - the way I always do it I prefer now this
03:41 - is the hours this is the minute and this
03:43 - is the seconds so we can put a colon in
03:46 - between each one let's refresh and you
03:48 - can see that what's happened
03:50 - oh no what's happened
03:56 - okay yet that's because I've actual date
04:00 - instead of actual time there that's my
04:01 - variable naming wrong there so let's
04:03 - refresh we'll see what's happened well
04:06 - we've got s T there oh that's it sorry
04:08 - that's a small X refresh so okay now
04:11 - we're showing the current time is 2014
04:15 - 34 and if I look at my clock on my
04:18 - computer right now that you can't see I
04:20 - know that that's correct so if i refresh
04:23 - you can see that this time will increase
04:27 - and as we come into the 50s we see this
04:29 - time start to increase and go up and
04:32 - then instead of just showing the normal
04:35 - boring seconds that we've shown before
04:36 - in the timestamp you can see this
04:38 - changes according to according to the
04:46 - time Stan that's dynamically updating
04:48 - because the seconds are increasing so we
04:50 - can format this in any way you like if
04:52 - you go over to the PHP manual and search
04:55 - for the function date you'll you'll be
04:58 - shown lots of examples of how to format
05:00 - this now what we can also do in here is
05:03 - we can include the date itself so you
05:08 - can do something like a capital D so we
05:11 - could say D and Y so this is going to
05:16 - show you the date the month and the year
05:17 - because obviously using a time stamp we
05:19 - can work out what the day is the month
05:21 - and the year as well so if i refresh
05:23 - that you can see it's coming up with
05:24 - Friday April 2011 so I can change this
05:28 - again I can put say a small D and a
05:30 - small M and what this is going to do is
05:32 - this could this is just going to process
05:33 - it slightly differently
05:34 - and show it a numerical format so
05:36 - there's a lot there's lots you can do
05:38 - I'm not going to cover everything that
05:40 - you can type in here in every way but
05:43 - what we could also do is we could say D
05:45 - my and we'll just change this to make
05:51 - sure it makes sense time or the date
05:53 - time and then I could say at H I sorry H
06:00 - PI s the code the colons in here are
06:03 - just for display purposes so this now
06:07 - reads the current date time is Friday
06:08 - April 2
06:09 - eleven at to zero or 816 and 31 seconds
06:14 - so by doing this I have taken a time
06:19 - stamp which originally we let's just
06:23 - kill the page there originally we found
06:25 - hard to understand because it's just an
06:26 - amount of seconds
06:27 - however PHP has some really useful
06:30 - functionality in order for us to turn
06:33 - this into a readable date so that's
06:37 - basically what a time stamp it is that's
06:39 - how you use it in PHP and like I said if
06:43 - you go over to the PHP manual and search
06:46 - for the date function you'll have a lot
06:48 - more that I have a lot more options
06:51 - there that you can format the date and
06:53 - time in
