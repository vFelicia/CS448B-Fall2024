00:00 - hey welcome back everybody this is Ian
00:02 - bringing you another video in this AI
00:03 - series with the New Boston so in today's
00:06 - video we are going to stay out of our
00:09 - code editor and we're just going to work
00:11 - inside of the promp layer dashboard so
00:13 - promp layer has a bunch of really cool
00:15 - features some of them we've covered in
00:17 - past videos in today's video we're going
00:19 - to cover the evaluate feature so in a
00:21 - nutshell what evaluate allows us to do
00:24 - is if we have a prompt or multiple
00:27 - prompts and we want to pass a data set
00:30 - through those prompts and see what the
00:32 - output is based on those inputs we can
00:35 - then run what's called a batch run which
00:37 - will automatically pipe our data set
00:40 - through the prompt or through the
00:41 - prompts give us the output at which
00:44 - point we can score it manually as a
00:46 - human grader or we can score it against
00:48 - a golden data set what the answers
00:50 - should be or we can have ai go back and
00:54 - look at it and give us an AI generated
00:56 - answer or rather an AI generated score
00:59 - and so in today's today's video we're
01:00 - going to look at the lattermost of those
01:02 - options we're going to have a additional
01:05 - prompt go back and look at the outputs
01:09 - from running our data set against our
01:11 - prompt and then we're going to have it
01:12 - give us a score so let's jump into it
01:15 - over here at the top we have the
01:16 - evaluate button this is at promp
01:18 - layer.com of course and we've already
01:20 - signed in so this is your welcome screen
01:22 - whenever you get to your dashboard so up
01:24 - top we're going to click on
01:27 - evaluate and this is going to take us to
01:29 - do something similar to this except
01:31 - you're not going to have all this
01:32 - history of previews and batch runs so
01:35 - the blue button here new batch run is
01:37 - going to allow us to create a new batch
01:39 - run let's go ahead and click on that and
01:41 - see what it has to offer so in the top
01:43 - right corner here we'll click on new
01:45 - batch run now we can give it a bat name
01:48 - so we'll simply call this one uh
01:52 - bies
01:55 - comments test and we're going to select
01:58 - the data set so the data set you can
02:00 - create yourself this just could be a CSV
02:02 - comma separated values if you export
02:05 - this from say a spreadsheet like Google
02:07 - sheet or Excel then you'll just have
02:09 - your headers up top and then you'll have
02:11 - all of your data in the subsequent rows
02:12 - everything will be comma delimited so
02:14 - we'll go ahead and select a pre-existing
02:16 - data set here but if you wanted to you
02:18 - could click on new data set here and you
02:20 - could upload a CSV file so I'm going to
02:23 - select Bucky's posts and we're going to
02:26 - use that specific data set if you don't
02:28 - have a data set you can always use one
02:30 - of these data set examples down here
02:31 - you've got three to choose from and you
02:33 - can download one of those and pipe it
02:35 - through against one of your prompts so
02:37 - I'm going to click on build preview
02:38 - right here this blue
02:40 - button and it's going to start me out
02:43 - with a single column so you can see that
02:45 - this is the data set that I uploaded
02:47 - it's got a handful of previews there's
02:50 - actually 16 rows in addition to the few
02:53 - that we're seeing here this is just kind
02:54 - of a truncated View and so this is using
02:57 - an input variable called content that's
02:59 - the top pop here you can see inside the
03:00 - curly brackets we have content and then
03:03 - this is the actual content so in your
03:05 - comma separated values file your CSV
03:07 - file the header would be content and
03:09 - then each one of the rows in that column
03:12 - would be this data that you're seeing
03:13 - here or whatever your data is for your
03:15 - arbitrary data set so then you can add
03:18 - additional
03:19 - columns so you choose the column type
03:23 - and this is where it gets really cool we
03:24 - can pick a prompt template from one of
03:26 - our existing prompt templates we can
03:28 - actually send the request through a
03:30 - custom API endpoint so we can run it
03:33 - against any number of functions in an
03:34 - API that we've written or we can use the
03:38 - human input option so I'm going to
03:40 - choose the prompt template here and
03:42 - click on next so the column name here
03:45 - I'm just going to call this comment and
03:47 - then I'm going to select a template as
03:48 - the next
03:50 - step and you can see I've got a bunch of
03:52 - templates already in my library my
03:54 - registry of templates that I've created
03:56 - so we want to create a comment so I'm
03:59 - going to use the the create comment
04:00 - option here for the template name create
04:02 - comment you can do it by version or by
04:04 - label if you do it by label then you can
04:06 - go through here and choose which label
04:08 - if you do it by version you can just go
04:09 - through and select the different
04:10 - versions the default of course will be
04:12 - the most recent version of that template
04:14 - so I'll go ahead and save this now you
04:17 - can go through and change the settings
04:19 - if you want your template may already
04:21 - have the settings embedded in it but if
04:23 - you want to be explicit about which
04:24 - model you're using then you just click
04:26 - this little pencil here and you can
04:28 - customize your engine parameters you can
04:30 - decide which llm provider you want to
04:33 - use you can use a specific model from
04:35 - the llm provider and so on and so forth
04:38 - once you're done with that you can save
04:39 - it there are Advanced controls for
04:41 - things like temperature max token C top
04:43 - P frequency penalty and so on so once
04:45 - you're done with all of that you go
04:46 - ahead and save it if you want to do the
04:48 - customize option here we don't need that
04:50 - so we're going to close that back out I
04:52 - have to go back and add my column now I
04:54 - didn't mean to close that all the way
04:55 - but prompt template next name is going
04:59 - to be comment we'll select our template
05:01 - here create comment default version
05:05 - using version save everything good here
05:08 - now you can see as far as the input
05:10 - variables are concerned we have one
05:12 - called postore content that's being
05:15 - pulled out of the prompt template and so
05:17 - we want to decide which column from our
05:19 - data set is going to be mapped to that
05:21 - input variable we only have one which is
05:23 - content so that's the one that we're
05:25 - going to select now we can click on run
05:27 - column and it's actually going to run
05:29 - that preview against those first few
05:31 - you'll notice that the rest are hidden
05:33 - and we'll be able to see those when we
05:34 - run the full batch so right away it's
05:38 - actually running this data set through
05:41 - that template and it's coming back with
05:43 - brand new output from in this case GPT 3
05:47 - and a half turbo so now what we want to
05:50 - do since we have the data set that's
05:52 - been piped through the template is we
05:54 - want to take an additional step add one
05:57 - more column where we include another
05:59 - prompt template that's going to look at
06:02 - this output based on that input and it's
06:04 - going to provide a score for us now as
06:08 - humans we could also look at it and have
06:09 - a column where we say okay this is good
06:12 - I'm going to give that a 100 that's bad
06:13 - I'm going to give that a zero but we
06:16 - also want to see if we can automate this
06:17 - process and hand it off to generative AI
06:20 - so let's go ahead and try that now we're
06:22 - going to click on ADD column
06:24 - here select the column type and again
06:28 - we're going to do a prompt template
06:30 - go next column name here we can just
06:32 - call it AI score if we want to and then
06:35 - select the template from the drop down
06:38 - I'm going to create comment
06:40 - evaluation so this is going to be the
06:43 - creation of an evaluation of a comment
06:45 - by our GPT model everything else is
06:48 - defaulted so we'll save that now this is
06:50 - the important part here the input
06:51 - variables we have our comment content
06:54 - right that is going to be the second
06:57 - column so we're going to send that one
06:59 - over to comment and then the next one
07:02 - post content is like we did previously
07:04 - that's going to be the content so the
07:06 - comment content is the output from our
07:10 - first prompt template and then the post
07:13 - content is the input from our CSV data
07:16 - set we can run this column and we're
07:19 - going to wait for these scores so I'm
07:21 - going to go ahead and move my camera out
07:24 - of the way here for a second so that we
07:25 - can see this button right here for run
07:27 - full batch let's go ahead and run the
07:29 - full batch cuz like I said these four
07:31 - pieces of data right here are only part
07:33 - of a larger 20 row data set so let's go
07:36 - ahead and run the full batch that's that
07:38 - button that you see up here in the
07:40 - corner and at this point it'll give you
07:42 - a suggested name or if you want to give
07:44 - it something more explicit you can type
07:46 - something here I'm going to go with the
07:47 - default Bucky's comments test and it
07:49 - just has today's date so I'll go ahead
07:51 - and click on create so it took a moment
07:53 - for these to come back but essentially
07:54 - what's happening is there are 20 rows of
07:57 - input data and therefore for the First
07:59 - Column has to pipe all 20 of those input
08:03 - variables through the prompt template
08:05 - sends 20 requests out to GPT 3 and half
08:07 - turbo waits for their responses and
08:09 - populates them here and then in order
08:12 - for our next prompt template to run with
08:15 - the scoring of the previous output it
08:18 - has to do the same thing all over again
08:20 - just on it's Shifting the data set over
08:22 - to the next column so it starts out with
08:25 - this input over here in the leftand
08:27 - column and it gets through this one and
08:30 - then once this output comes back now
08:32 - this one runs based on this output and
08:34 - we finally get these scores here so we
08:37 - can take a look at these we can see okay
08:39 - the comment here is it's so nice out
08:41 - today and then the comment that was
08:42 - generated by the AI was H I wish I could
08:45 - be outside enjoying it stuck inside
08:47 - studying for exams and then the score
08:51 - based on this input and this AI driven
08:53 - output is 80 from our prompt template so
08:57 - you can go through these and you can see
08:59 - and assess okay how well is the AI
09:02 - scoring these outputs that of course is
09:04 - going to be subjective to you the person
09:06 - that created all this but in addition to
09:08 - all that you can modify your batch run
09:11 - here to have an additional column that
09:14 - allows you as the human to provide
09:16 - scores so you can go in and manually say
09:18 - yes based on this input this is very
09:21 - close to what I expected and therefore
09:22 - it's a 90 or 95 or 100 or no based on
09:26 - this input this is not what I was
09:28 - expecting so this is close cl to a zero
09:30 - so that would be the human output this
09:32 - video we're specifically focusing on the
09:36 - AI generated output but in future videos
09:38 - we'll come back and show you how you can
09:40 - add additional columns for grading
09:42 - against a golden standard so when you
09:44 - already have the expected output you can
09:47 - see what the AI gave us and what it
09:50 - should have given us and you can see how
09:52 - those differ or the other option is that
09:55 - you as a human can go in and physically
09:57 - say okay this is 100 or this is a zero
09:59 - or anything in between that so this has
10:01 - been making batch runs of your
10:02 - evaluations against your prompt
10:04 - templates with your example data sets
10:06 - thanks a lot for watching this video
10:08 - can't wait to see you in the next one
10:10 - until next time peace
