00:00 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to continue
00:07 - working on our FTP downloader so if you
00:11 - remember from the previous tutorial we
00:13 - added this notify new file
00:15 - icon um which is a notify icon now what
00:18 - we need to do is set an icon for this so
00:20 - that it'll show up in our system tray so
00:23 - let's just use this star right here now
00:25 - this star is going to be used in the
00:27 - next series of tutorials where we create
00:30 - a favorites viewer but we can also use
00:32 - it for this too so we're going to have a
00:34 - star for our icon so we'll come back
00:37 - here and we'll go to form one.
00:40 - VB and hold on
00:46 - here okay so what we need to
00:50 - do sorry about that I had to look at uh
00:53 - my previous project that I that I had
00:55 - created so what we need to do is show
00:58 - the user that a new file has been found
01:01 - so we'll type notifi new file. show
01:04 - balloon tip now a balloon tip is one of
01:09 - those things uh if you're on Windows
01:11 - right now a balloon tip is when you see
01:14 - a little balloon looking thing pop out
01:16 - from one of your icons in your system
01:18 - tray and it tells you something now you
01:20 - may have seen this with um a Windows
01:22 - updater or something like that um and it
01:24 - has a little has a little x button on it
01:27 - so this is going to take some arguments
01:29 - we're going to need the timeout so let's
01:31 - set the timeout to 10 seconds now this
01:33 - is in milliseconds so what we need to do
01:37 - is put 10,000 milliseconds which is
01:39 - going to be equal to 10 seconds now the
01:42 - next thing we need to do is set the
01:44 - title of the tip now to show tool
01:46 - balloon tips you have to use uh a notify
01:49 - icon because there has to be an icon in
01:52 - the tray for you to show a balloon tip
01:53 - you can't do it from an icon in the
01:56 - taskbar so let's set the title to new
01:59 - file
02:00 - file and we'll just set the text
02:05 - to the new file found is and then we'll
02:11 - just go ahead and
02:13 - add let's see file do fil name. twring
02:18 - or file name is already a string so we
02:20 - can just leave it like that and then the
02:22 - tip icon is going to be tool tip icon
02:28 - doino so this will set the icon of our
02:31 - tool tip now let's go ahead and run
02:37 - this and you can see here that we've got
02:40 - start checking for new files so if I
02:42 - click
02:44 - this it's going to say um it's going to
02:48 - check for new files now that just showed
02:50 - up uh a whole bunch of balloon tips
02:53 - because it did that for each one of
02:54 - these because it did not contain it so
02:56 - we'll go to home home
02:58 - directory and let's see
03:03 - here we need to change this
03:09 - to let's see so it looks like it's not
03:13 - um changing our uh text for this so
03:17 - let's go
03:19 - ahead and we'll copy
03:23 - this go ahead and paste that right there
03:26 - and then paste that right
03:28 - there so so we'll get rid of this and
03:32 - we'll set checking to true to begin
03:36 - with okay so now let's run this
03:43 - again and if we start checking for new
03:46 - files ah there we go that was the
03:49 - problem it changed the text of this
03:50 - instead of this um because I didn't use
03:53 - very good names so let's just undo this
03:56 - stuff we did
03:58 - here and that's not what I wanted to
04:04 - do okay so instead of button check for
04:08 - new files we want
04:10 - button let's
04:13 - see start check
04:16 - timer so we'll just copy
04:23 - this and we will paste it right
04:28 - here
04:31 - Ah that's not where we want to paste it
04:33 - we want to paste it um right
04:41 - here okay so now if we go ahead and run
04:46 - this if we click start checking for new
04:49 - files you can see it changes to stop and
04:52 - it shows us a balloon tip down here now
04:55 - let me pause right here and I will try
04:57 - to show the balloon tip
05:00 - okay so I've moved the recording down to
05:02 - here and let's just go ahead uh we'll
05:05 - clear the list and then you can see that
05:08 - because it's checking for new files it
05:09 - gives us a balloon tip that says new
05:11 - file found is youtube. text now it
05:13 - actually did that for each one of these
05:15 - but it scrolled through so fast that you
05:16 - couldn't see it so we can stop checking
05:18 - for new files and then we can clear and
05:21 - then every tenth of a second it's going
05:23 - to check to see if there's a new file so
05:25 - it's going to say new file found so if
05:27 - we upload a file so let's say we
05:32 - upload um the
05:36 - dragon we can go ahead and we'll see
05:39 - that it's going to check and find the
05:47 - dragon now let's see
05:54 - here actually that will not um trigger
05:57 - this to tell us as a new file because
06:00 - when we upload it's going to refresh the
06:02 - list by itself and so it's going to see
06:04 - that that file is already in there so
06:07 - we'll go ahead and close out of so go
06:09 - ahead put this code in if you haven't
06:11 - already um and you should get the
06:14 - complete program to where you can do a
06:15 - whole bunch of stuff with FTP and you
06:17 - can have it check for new files and
06:19 - notify you when that
06:21 - happens so thanks for watching guys and
06:23 - stay tuned for the next
06:25 - tutorial
