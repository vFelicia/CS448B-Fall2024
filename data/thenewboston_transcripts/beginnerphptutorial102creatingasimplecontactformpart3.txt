00:00 - so let's go in here and we need to first
00:03 - of all set a few variables up so we need
00:04 - to say two is equal to something and
00:07 - that's just clearly my email address so
00:09 - I'm going to be sending this to my own
00:11 - email address since it's a contact us
00:13 - form the inquiries are going to come to
00:16 - me so this is my email address the next
00:20 - one is the subject so I'm just going to
00:24 - pre define the subject as contact form
00:28 - submitted just to let me know when I
00:30 - receive an email the subject is contact
00:32 - form submitted and what's this going to
00:37 - do is it's going to just let me know
00:38 - that a contact form has been submitted
00:40 - that's all basically yeah it's up to you
00:42 - what you set the header to now the body
00:44 - is going to equal the contact text so
00:48 - the text that the contact the user sorry
00:51 - has entered in this text field here and
00:56 - we are going to also set headers and the
01:01 - headers is just going to be from and
01:03 - then the email address is going to come
01:05 - here so what why do we do this so let's
01:07 - I'll just put the variable in first so
01:09 - contact email now what this is going to
01:12 - do is when I receive the email on my
01:14 - squirrel mail client here when I get the
01:17 - email it's going to say it's from and
01:19 - the email address that the user actually
01:21 - typed in in the HTML form this way what
01:24 - I can do is I can quickly press reply
01:26 - and it will set up a reply to this email
01:28 - address where it came from
01:30 - so it's really nifty way of being able
01:32 - to quickly instantly reply to a user Wow
01:35 - after you've had contact form submitted
01:37 - and if you don't understand what I mean
01:38 - then I'll show you a bit later when I
01:41 - actually receive the email so everything
01:45 - seems set up now we've got the contact
01:48 - text in there
01:50 - we've got from and we need the also the
01:53 - contact name so we can put this anywhere
01:57 - really we could say body equals and
02:01 - contact name and then we can append onto
02:07 - it remember when we want to do a line
02:09 - break we need to use double quotation
02:10 - marks we can append a line break on
02:12 - there so we'll have the contacts name
02:14 - and then a line break and then what
02:16 - they've written in the form so now that
02:18 - we've got each value here we can use the
02:22 - mail function so mail the parameters are
02:25 - first of all who it's to and then the
02:28 - subject and then the body and then the
02:32 - headers but what we want to do is we
02:34 - want to double check that the email has
02:36 - actually been sent so we can enclose
02:37 - this in an if statement and what this
02:41 - does is if this returns true it means
02:42 - the mail has been successfully sent so
02:45 - we can echo out a confirmation message
02:47 - and we can say if mail then echo mail or
02:57 - or thanks for contacting us we'll
03:04 - remember to escape that character there
03:06 - because we're using single quotation
03:09 - marks and we used a single quotation
03:10 - mark inside the string with the single
03:12 - quotation marks we'll be in touch soon
03:17 - for example otherwise we want to let
03:22 - them know that we couldn't send the mail
03:24 - at this time we're not going to be
03:26 - echoing out any errors so we want to put
03:27 - an @ sign in front of the mail so if
03:29 - this does return any errors we're not
03:32 - actually displaying these to the user so
03:34 - now we can say echo sorry an error
03:39 - occurred
03:41 - who spoke heard well please try again
03:44 - later
03:46 - okay so if the male sent and we're
03:49 - silencing this so if we do receive any
03:51 - errors from this it won't be displayed
03:52 - to our user we're going to say thanks
03:54 - for contacting us we'll be in touch soon
03:56 - the you now will then be sent
03:58 - automatically even though it's inside an
03:59 - if condition and then otherwise we're
04:02 - going to say sorry an error occurred
04:03 - peace try again later let's go ahead and
04:05 - save the changes and we'll come over to
04:07 - our contact form and test this out so
04:10 - I've got my squirrel mail client opened
04:13 - at the moment this is a test email that
04:14 - came in earlier when I was testing this
04:16 - so don't worry about that for now but
04:18 - we'll let's fill out this form to see if
04:21 - we get an email back so let's say Alex
04:23 - my email address I'm going to set to
04:25 - Alex at PHP academy' de org and here I'm
04:28 - going to say hi just wondered how to
04:35 - well we can write anything really how to
04:37 - create a PHP file something silly lilacs
04:42 - we're doing doing a PHP tutorial so why
04:44 - not
04:45 - so now let's click send thanks for
04:47 - contacting us we'll be in touch soon
04:49 - let's go over to the squirrel now and
04:52 - click inbox and you can see that I've
04:54 - got an email from Alex at PHP academy'
04:57 - de org remember the email address that
05:02 - we are saying it from is this email here
05:05 - that we filled out let's go ahead and
05:07 - click on it okay so it says now Alex
05:11 - this is the user that has sent submit to
05:14 - this form so the name of the person that
05:16 - submitted the form and then like I said
05:18 - before we're breaking down and we're
05:20 - saying hi just wondered how to create a
05:23 - PHP file so we've got the name of the
05:25 - user here and we've got the body of the
05:29 - text that they fill down the text area
05:31 - here so now when we go to click reply
05:36 - here what it'll automatically do is
05:39 - reply to the email address that the user
05:42 - supplied in here so this is a really
05:44 - useful way of doing things because then
05:46 - you also got their text here their
05:47 - question that they asked here
05:49 - and you can just come here and type in
05:51 - your reply here so that's how to create
05:54 - a basic contact form in PHP and there's
05:58 - a couple of things that you need to take
05:59 - into account before you actually put
06:01 - this on a public server
