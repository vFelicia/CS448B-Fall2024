00:00 - what's going on guys welcome to your
00:01 - twenty-third tutorial and in this
00:03 - tutorial I want to talk to you guys a
00:05 - little more about event handlers so
00:07 - before we learn that you can take a
00:10 - basic event handler such as the onclick
00:12 - event handler and you could place it
00:14 - somewhere such as in a forum button but
00:17 - now what I want to show you guys is
00:18 - there are more event handlers than that
00:20 - basic on click and also you can place
00:23 - them in different locations you're not
00:25 - only limited to form buttons you can
00:27 - place them in links and actually some
00:29 - places where you probably never even
00:31 - think of so let's go ahead and make one
00:33 - type of event handler and this is called
00:36 - the on mouse-over event handler and this
00:39 - gets called whenever you mouse over an
00:42 - element for example you don't have to
00:44 - click it you don't have to you know
00:46 - highlight it as soon as your mouse
00:48 - hovers over it that's when it gets
00:49 - called so as you know we could do it
00:52 - with a form button but we already did
00:55 - that so let's go ahead and try something
00:57 - new and let's go ahead and make a link
00:59 - and might as well make it to the
01:01 - greatest website of all time the New
01:02 - Boston comm and go ahead and might as
01:06 - well and that and let's go ahead and
01:09 - write some text like hover over me
01:11 - explanation point because we really want
01:13 - to emphasize this so what I like to do
01:15 - is save it launch it in Chrome and click
01:18 - it make sure our link works all right
01:20 - we're good to go so far so now we have a
01:23 - basic link on the screen so now let's go
01:25 - ahead and add that on mouse-over event
01:27 - handler so just like before like the
01:30 - onclick we add it kind of as attribute
01:32 - and that's on mouse over with the M and
01:36 - the O capitalized now as your value we
01:40 - can set it equal to JavaScript code so
01:41 - let's just go ahead and I'm just going
01:43 - to make basic alert boxes um you can do
01:46 - different things but a an alert box is
01:48 - just easiest to see what's going on with
01:50 - this example so alerts and then just go
01:53 - ahead and write something stupid like
01:57 - game time
01:59 - because I feel like playing call of duty
02:01 - right now so let's go ahead and save
02:03 - this and we refresh it and check it out
02:06 - I'm not going to click it and I'm not
02:08 - going to highlight it I'm just going to
02:09 - scroll have my mouse go over it and as
02:13 - soon as it hovers over it an alert box
02:15 - pops up that says game time so that is
02:18 - the beauty of the onmouseover you don't
02:21 - have to click it as soon as you hover
02:22 - over it maybe it should be called on
02:25 - hover over but it isn't I don't name
02:27 - them so that's the basics of that so now
02:31 - that I mentioned onmouseover I feel
02:33 - compelled to mention this one on Mouse
02:37 - out and this is a little bit different
02:40 - it's whenever you are hovering over a
02:43 - link and you don't click it but you take
02:45 - your mouse away from it then that's what
02:48 - this is get called so let's go ahead and
02:51 - put gametime be like hey come back so
02:55 - now let's go ahead and save it and see
02:57 - what happens again no clicking involved
02:59 - here so what I'm going to do is I'm
03:01 - going to take my mouse hover over it
03:04 - nothing happens still but whenever we
03:06 - take it away that's when that event
03:08 - handler is going to be called in again
03:10 - that's on Mouse out whenever you take
03:13 - your mouse away from an element so it
03:15 - says hey come back then you go ahead and
03:17 - click ok so technically if you had a web
03:20 - page and you had like 200 links on it
03:22 - you could add one of these to every link
03:24 - and then you can create the most
03:26 - annoying web page ever but who would
03:28 - want to do that if you do then go ahead
03:31 - and send me a link and I'll check it out
03:32 - but anyways let's go ahead and get rid
03:35 - of that for now and actually might as
03:37 - well go ahead and get rid of this entire
03:39 - link because I want to talk to you guys
03:40 - about a different subject now that we
03:43 - know that you can add event handlers to
03:46 - different elements on a web page I'm
03:48 - going to show you guys one place where
03:50 - you probably wouldn't think that you
03:52 - could add event handlers and that's in
03:53 - the body tag itself so go ahead and
03:56 - actually before you get to that just add
03:58 - some text on the screen yadda yadda
03:59 - yadda and save it and check it out our
04:02 - web page loads and we have some basic
04:04 - text on the screen just like that so we
04:08 - can't just add any event hand
04:10 - alert to the body like we can't add on
04:13 - click or onmouseover there are specific
04:16 - event handlers that you can answer your
04:18 - body tags and one of those is called on
04:20 - load and this is going to be called if I
04:23 - hit my caps lock this is going to get
04:26 - called whenever your webpage is done
04:29 - loading so let's go ahead and just make
04:32 - an basic alert and make something that
04:37 - says like your webpage or website has
04:41 - loaded explanation point die so
04:44 - everything wrong this wrong this right
04:46 - this right this wrong perfect so let's
04:48 - go ahead and save this run it and I'll
04:50 - show you guys what happens our webpage
04:52 - loads and when it's done loading it just
04:55 - says your website has loaded dee dee
04:58 - good enough okay
05:00 - so you might be thinking I know it looks
05:02 - like everything's happening at the same
05:03 - time but if you had a slow motion camera
05:05 - you can see that your webpage loads and
05:08 - then the JavaScript pops up so that's
05:11 - why it's a little bit different than
05:13 - saying this all right buck you're going
05:14 - to do that then why wouldn't you just
05:15 - have the JavaScript right here well
05:17 - sometimes you don't want to run
05:19 - JavaScript as soon as your webpage
05:21 - starts loading you want to run it as
05:23 - soon as everything is complete and right
05:26 - now I'm just making alert boxes in it's
05:29 - not really useful example but later on
05:31 - I'll show you guys why it would be
05:32 - useful to load a bit of code after your
05:35 - website has loaded so now that I showed
05:39 - you guys the onload alert or excuse me
05:42 - the onload event handler um you guys are
05:45 - probably thinking all right then is
05:46 - there on unload Wow I definitely have my
05:50 - caps lock and I definitely typed
05:52 - everything around so on unload there we
05:55 - go
05:55 - so now let's go ahead and see what this
05:58 - does but instead of your website has
06:01 - loaded because that doesn't make sense
06:02 - anymore just go ahead and write like
06:04 - goodbye
06:04 - so the on unload event gets called
06:07 - whenever the user exits a web page and
06:10 - they can do this by clicking a link and
06:12 - it takes them to another web page or
06:14 - even if they try to close out of their
06:16 - browser this code is going to be is
06:18 - going to run before it lets them go so
06:20 - let's go ahead and I already save this
06:22 - refresh it
06:23 - and it says goodbye so let me go ahead
06:26 - and the reason it said goodbye already
06:30 - is because whenever I refreshed it I
06:32 - left that webpage so check it out so now
06:35 - I have a web page with that unload I
06:39 - cannot talk tonight on unload function
06:43 - already in there so whenever I try to
06:45 - close out of my browser it's going to
06:47 - stop me before and it's going to say
06:48 - goodbye so let's go ahead and close out
06:50 - of this and it says goodbye before it
06:53 - lets me leave so click OK and now let's
06:56 - go ahead and just watch it in chrome
06:58 - again see it loads perfectly like that
07:01 - because we haven't left it yet so again
07:03 - whenever I try to close out of my
07:04 - browser it says all right before you go
07:07 - I just want to say goodbye I miss you
07:09 - farewell
07:10 - so now you can see the basics of you
07:14 - know different types of event handlers
07:15 - not only are there different kinds of
07:18 - event handlers like on click on Mouse
07:20 - over on Mouse out and then your loads
07:22 - but you can also begin to see that we
07:25 - can stick them in different locations
07:26 - we're not only limited to buttons or
07:29 - links and we're not even limited to the
07:32 - body but in the upcoming tutorials I'm
07:34 - going to show you guys all the different
07:36 - types in places and why they're useful
07:39 - and we're going to be getting more in
07:41 - depth because this is one of the main
07:43 - concepts behind JavaScript and now we
07:46 - can start to see we're beginning to
07:48 - build smarter and more interactive web
07:50 - pages but for now that's all you get so
07:52 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
07:54 - to subscribe and I'll see you guys later
