00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:03 - and this is another video for the new
00:05 - Boston now we've already looked at our
00:07 - custom server and database exceptions
00:10 - now what we're going to be looking about
00:12 - is coming into our extended classes here
00:15 - but taking some information and
00:19 - outputting some useful information so
00:21 - what we've done is we've created errors
00:24 - in route and a database so I've changed
00:27 - route to Alex and what that's done is if
00:29 - we refresh and we're saying could not
00:31 - connect a server and if we if we are
00:34 - changing a database and appending or one
00:36 - on we're saying Canucks
00:39 - select database now what I want to do is
00:41 - give them a more specific error so I
00:43 - want to say what line it's on and what
00:46 - file it is from so again this may be a
00:49 - useless example but you can understand
00:51 - then the concept of everything so what
00:54 - I'm going to do is I'm going to delete
00:56 - this and we are just going to echo out a
01:01 - custom error message depending on our
01:03 - server server exception and database
01:05 - exception I'm going to be changing these
01:07 - functions names names in a bit when
01:10 - we've redefined them so up here at the
01:12 - moment we've got nothing within our
01:13 - brackets but if I pull these down we can
01:16 - start to define custom functions inside
01:19 - or methods rather because obviously in
01:21 - object-oriented programming which is
01:24 - this is part of we are looking at
01:26 - methods we're calling the methods so
01:29 - what we can say is we can say public
01:31 - function we can say show a specific
01:39 - and again we're going to create a block
01:42 - inside this as well so here is going to
01:43 - be our error message so what this is
01:46 - going to do is it's going to echo out in
01:48 - fact it's going to return and what we
01:51 - want to return is the first of all the
01:52 - line number that we find the error on
01:54 - and then the file itself that we're
01:56 - actually in which is going to be
01:57 - index.php so we want to return this we
02:02 - use this it's not a defined variable
02:04 - that I've defined anywhere this just
02:05 - means this in general here this and
02:09 - we're going to say get line okay get
02:15 - line so we can make it look a bit more
02:17 - user friendly error on on line something
02:22 - so this line here and then we're going
02:26 - to say append on some more text in this
02:35 - get file so now what our error is going
02:39 - to read is error on line and we're
02:41 - appending on the line that this has been
02:44 - this error has been thrown on so error
02:53 - also thrown well to make it make a bit
02:57 - more sense
02:58 - so error thrown on line something in
03:00 - this file okay so let's just test that
03:05 - and then we'll create another one for
03:06 - the database exception as well so at the
03:08 - moment we if we refresh it looks like
03:11 - we're connected apps that you find so we
03:13 - need to change this remember here this
03:15 - currently says get message and that's a
03:17 - echoing out this message here so let's
03:20 - delete these and we'll create purposely
03:23 - create a server error we'll see what
03:27 - happens nothing oh yeah okay so it's
03:31 - because um we want this function show
03:33 - specific we want to take that from our
03:37 - exception that we're thrown so we're
03:39 - going to say show specific okay so
03:43 - now let's refresh
03:45 - okay so we are showing that an error has
03:49 - been thrown on line 21 in and then we
03:52 - echo the file name out so a custom error
03:55 - message where the exception has been
03:56 - thrown is successful so it reads error
04:00 - thrown in line something in so let's
04:02 - just double check everything I know the
04:04 - file name is fine because we can see
04:06 - that here we're working with index.php
04:09 - even though it wasn't previously shown
04:11 - with area so wherever thrown on line 21
04:13 - let's go and have a look to see where
04:14 - the error has been thrown so the throw
04:18 - new server exception is on this line
04:20 - here and you can see that down here in
04:23 - the corner it's line 21
04:24 - so we're successfully showing the right
04:27 - information so now what we can do is do
04:30 - the same thing for database exception we
04:32 - can create a public function show
04:35 - specific and we can do exactly the same
04:40 - thing so it can return error thrown on
04:45 - line and then we say this get line okay
04:52 - so remember this is a this.get line here
04:56 - and this get file here is a method
04:59 - within exception however because we're
05:01 - extending this we're actually putting it
05:05 - into use in our server exception which
05:07 - we've them which we've called ourselves
05:08 - or named ourselves rather so this get
05:13 - line and then we append on in and then
05:16 - we append on to that this get file
05:22 - okay so now that should do exactly the
05:25 - same thing
05:25 - let's return this to route so we don't
05:28 - don't throw an error for that I mean
05:30 - remember we need to change this to show
05:33 - specific
05:35 - okay so let's change our database
05:38 - information so we throw an error for
05:40 - this refresh and now it says oh we've
05:45 - missed out a little space there let's
05:47 - pop a space in there to make it neat so
05:50 - we've got error thrown on line 25 in the
05:54 - same file obviously so let's go to line
05:56 - 25 and check where the error has been
05:59 - thrown so the exception has been thrown
06:01 - mother it's this line here which is
06:02 - database exception so you've probably
06:04 - guessed that the line that is thrown er
06:06 - is 25 so you can see but that by
06:09 - extending our exception class we can
06:14 - create our own methods inside to use
06:15 - data from our exception class there's
06:17 - much more than this you go on the PHP
06:19 - manual you'll be able to find a lot more
06:21 - methods inside and properties you can
06:24 - take from from this exception class and
06:27 - put it into your own and then we've
06:29 - thrown our exceptions ourself using
06:32 - catch twice while we're throwing twice
06:36 - so that's how you're going to extend our
06:40 - exception out your exception class and
06:42 - how you're going to catch multiple upset
06:46 - exceptions with your own custom error
06:50 - message
