00:00 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:05 - this tutorial we're going to be
00:06 - continuing creating our calculator now
00:09 - if you don't know what I'm talking about
00:10 - then you may want to move back a couple
00:12 - couple tutorials and catch up to what
00:13 - we're
00:15 - doing now you can see here that we added
00:19 - the two numbers num one and num two by
00:23 - using our ad function that we created
00:25 - and we just converted the text from
00:27 - those text boxes to a double now what we
00:30 - want to do is we want to put answer in
00:32 - the answer box so we're going to do this
00:35 - by
00:36 - typing text answer. text equals answer
00:43 - and then we'll just leave it like that
00:44 - we're not going to convert it to a
00:45 - string because we may use that answer
00:49 - later on so let's go ahead and run our
00:53 - program and see what
00:55 - happens so we got first number let do 23
01:00 - number 45 and we add them we get
01:05 - 68 now what if the user forgot to enter
01:09 - a value in for one of the boxes well
01:12 - what we're going to do is we're going to
01:14 - enclose all of this in an if statement
01:17 - so we're going to go ahead and type if
01:20 - text num one. text.
01:24 - length equals 0 or does not equal Z
01:31 - and text num two
01:34 - do uh. text. length does not equal zero
01:39 - either then go ahead and do
01:42 - this so we'll just add an end if right
01:46 - here and we're going to we're going to
01:48 - add an else statement so else and
01:53 - so if one of the boxes is empty if the
01:55 - length does equal zero on one of the
01:57 - boxes then we're going to go ahead and
01:59 - type
02:00 - messagebox Dosh
02:03 - show please fill all
02:08 - fields and then we'll just set the title
02:10 - to
02:11 - error and we'll type message boox
02:14 - buttons.
02:19 - okay and we will set the icon just to a
02:22 - warning because an error didn't really
02:24 - happen so message box icon
02:31 - messagebox
02:33 - icons.
02:47 - warning okay message boox icon. warning
02:50 - not
02:52 - icons and now let's go ahead and run
02:54 - this and see what happens if they leave
02:56 - a field
02:57 - empty so here's first first number so if
03:00 - we type this in we click add it says
03:03 - please fill all fields and you can see
03:05 - it gives them the warning icon and then
03:08 - if we fill this with something and click
03:09 - add it will give us an
03:12 - answer let's go ahe and close this
03:17 - out now what if the user wants to
03:21 - continue adding numbers to the answer so
03:23 - what we're going to do is after we set
03:26 - text answer. text equal to answer we
03:28 - will just type
03:31 - text num 2.
03:34 - readon equals
03:37 - true so what this does is we can access
03:40 - the properties of text num one while
03:42 - we're programming and change them on the
03:44 - fly so it sets read only equal to true
03:47 - now if we run this you can see that if
03:49 - we type some numbers in here and click
03:52 - add it'll set this one equal to read
03:55 - only now we need to do text text num two
03:58 - not text num one
04:00 - so let's just do that one more
04:03 - time so you can see that it sets it to
04:06 - read only and we can't do anything to
04:09 - it so before we set it to read only
04:13 - we're going to have to clear it so
04:15 - textum 2. CLE so this will let them keep
04:19 - adding numbers to the answer and what we
04:22 - need to do because we're allowing them
04:24 - to do this we need to add a clear
04:27 - button so we'll just come over here to
04:30 - our toolbox We'll add a button down
04:36 - here and we will set the name to button
04:42 - clear so we'll come up here and change
04:44 - it to button
04:47 - clear and then we will set the text to
04:53 - clear now if we go ahead and dble double
04:55 - click on this it opens up the event for
04:59 - this
05:00 - and what we want to do is when they
05:02 - click clear then we'll just set text num
05:06 - 2 do read only equals false so that they
05:11 - can read from it and we'll just clear
05:13 - each one of those text
05:18 - boxes all right let's just do text
05:21 - answer.
05:24 - clear and text num 2. CLE so now we run
05:31 - this you can see we have first number
05:34 - and second number and if we type some
05:36 - values in and add
05:38 - them you can see that it gives us the
05:41 - option to press clear and when we do it
05:43 - resets it now let's come up here and
05:46 - instead of setting this instead of
05:48 - clearing texum to we'll just leave it to
05:50 - the same to see what they added but it
05:52 - will not continually um add numbers to
05:57 - the it it won't continue continually add
06:00 - first number and second number to the
06:01 - answer now we'll be covering this in the
06:04 - next tutorial so um look at this code
06:06 - you can modify it if you want play
06:08 - around with it test see what you can do
06:10 - with it and uh once you know what it
06:12 - does go ahead and move on to the next
06:14 - tutorial and thanks for watching
