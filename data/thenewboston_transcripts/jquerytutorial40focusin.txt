00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - looking at the jquery focus in event
00:09 - handler and then in the next video we're
00:12 - going to be looking at the focus out
00:14 - handler essentially what we're going to
00:16 - be creating is a form field where the
00:19 - user would be to type for example their
00:21 - name and when we focus in we're going to
00:24 - give the user a bit more information to
00:26 - help them out and then when they focus
00:29 - away perhaps onto the page itself or on
00:31 - to another field we remove this span
00:35 - text so just so we can get the idea of
00:38 - what we're creating let's go ahead and
00:39 - create our input type our input field
00:43 - and as well as span so input type is
00:48 - equal to text and I'm going to give this
00:52 - an ID of name I'm then going to create a
00:56 - span afterwards and the ID of the span
00:59 - is going to be say name span and I'll in
01:05 - that span tag there I just have to label
01:07 - in front of here so for example your
01:10 - name now let's go refresh our page in
01:14 - our browser and see this you've got your
01:16 - name and we can type in a name here now
01:19 - what we want to happen is as soon as the
01:21 - user focuses in to this field either by
01:25 - tabbing down the page for example they
01:28 - might come from this field to another
01:30 - field that's why we're using focus in
01:32 - and not the on click or the click event
01:35 - in jQuery if we were to use the click
01:38 - event for this the user would have to
01:40 - click rather than tab down the page so
01:43 - as soon as this field is in focus in
01:45 - some way or another then the span here
01:48 - will give us a bit more information so
01:51 - let's go ahead and start to create our
01:54 - our javascript file
01:56 - I'm gonna save it in the J's folder and
01:58 - I'm gonna call this focus is okay so
02:02 - inside index dot PHP we need to include
02:05 - this in our page so let's go ahead and
02:07 - include this here so the script type is
02:10 - text
02:10 - slash JavaScript the source is Jay s /fo
02:16 - 'kiss dr. J s and will come just to end
02:20 - at the script there so now we've
02:22 - included focused at Jay s we can go
02:24 - ahead and start to write the code inside
02:26 - so we reference the text field with
02:31 - creative which is name so we can write
02:34 - in here hash name now we want to say
02:36 - focus in so dot focus in and this is the
02:41 - event handler and that we need inside of
02:44 - this we're going to create a function
02:45 - and we'll just pull that down so we can
02:49 - work inside a block here now what we
02:52 - want to do is add some text to this span
02:55 - here so let's go ahead and reference
02:57 - that we're gonna say hash named span dot
03:03 - HTML and we can write in enter your full
03:10 - name so now what's going to happen is
03:15 - when we refresh our page
03:16 - and we click here we get this text enter
03:19 - your full name now let's go ahead and
03:22 - duplicate the current field we have and
03:25 - actually create something else so I'm
03:28 - gonna say your age I'm going to keep
03:31 - this as a input type of text but I'm
03:34 - going to change this to age and
03:35 - similarly similarly I'm going to change
03:38 - this to age as well oh no sorry yep we
03:43 - need age just here so let's surround
03:47 - these in paragraphs just to separate
03:49 - this out and we'll be able to see out
03:52 - two fields one below each other so when
03:57 - we click on your name it says unto your
03:59 - full name when we cook on age nothing
04:01 - happens at the moment because we don't
04:03 - have a handle of this let's take the
04:06 - easy option and we'll go and just copy
04:09 - and paste this down and we'll change
04:11 - this here to age we'll change this here
04:13 - to age and we'll change the message so
04:17 - enter your
04:21 - current age okay so now that that's
04:24 - working when we click on your name we
04:26 - get this spam filled with this text when
04:28 - we click on here we get this span filled
04:31 - with this text however what happens if
04:33 - we were to click on your name and then
04:35 - we tab down we still get the text if we
04:40 - were using the click function or the
04:43 - click event handler you'll notice that
04:45 - it will work a bit differently so let's
04:47 - change both of these to click refresh
04:51 - the page in our browser when I click on
04:53 - it it still works we still have this
04:55 - information relayed back to the user
04:57 - however I'm going to press tab on my
05:00 - keyboard to tab down to age and you'll
05:02 - see that we don't get this text appear
05:05 - in the span here so the reason we use
05:08 - focus in is to actually allow this event
05:12 - to take place or this event handler to
05:14 - be called when we actually have focus on
05:17 - the text area rather than a user
05:19 - clicking on it it's extremely unlikely
05:21 - that a user would come along to a
05:23 - website and click each individual field
05:25 - so now that we know the reason why we
05:28 - use the focus in in the next tutorial
05:32 - we're going to be looking at focus out
05:33 - to get rid of this span when the user
05:36 - focuses away from it
