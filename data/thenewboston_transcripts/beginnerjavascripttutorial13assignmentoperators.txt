00:00 - what is up guys it's Bucky and welcome
00:02 - to your 13th JavaScript tutorial and
00:04 - this tutorial is probably going to be a
00:06 - real quick one because I'm only going to
00:08 - be talking about one thing and that is
00:09 - called assignment operators so I already
00:12 - taught you guys what the assignment
00:14 - operator is so say we had a variable
00:16 - equal to Bucky and let's go ahead and
00:19 - set it equal to 24 because that's my age
00:21 - and if we go ahead and just document
00:25 - right out
00:27 - Bucky it's going to go ahead and print
00:28 - 2400 screen no need to show you guys
00:31 - that but hey I will anyways right there
00:33 - so that is the assignment operator
00:35 - basically an equal sign but there are
00:38 - different types of operators to in there
00:41 - pretty much like little shortcuts and
00:43 - there's an add an assigned operator
00:45 - which pretty much takes a variable and
00:48 - in order to use the add in a sign
00:51 - operator you put plus equal sign and
00:54 - then to the right of it you put a number
00:56 - like 54 now what this is going to do is
01:00 - it's going to say all right the value of
01:02 - Bucky is 24 so if I add 54 to it I get
01:06 - the new value of 78 so now Bucky equals
01:10 - 78 so let's go ahead and refresh this
01:13 - and when it prints out Bucky it says 78
01:15 - so it doesn't change Bucky 254 what it
01:19 - does is it takes Bucky adds 54 to it and
01:22 - assigns it the new value so aside from
01:25 - um which is called the add and assign
01:28 - operator you have the subtract and
01:30 - assign operator right there choose 54
01:34 - why not which gives you negative 30 the
01:37 - multiply and assign
01:40 - and the divide in a sign which is I have
01:46 - no idea what this value is oh nice
01:49 - so aside from the add in a sign
01:53 - subtraction sign multiply divided and
01:54 - assign there's one other one and that's
01:57 - called the modulus and inside modulus
01:59 - and a sign and to tell you the truth
02:03 - what this does is it takes an integer
02:06 - remainder or basically the remainder and
02:09 - it you know what remember this don't
02:14 - ever use the modulus and a sign I've
02:16 - been programming for I don't even know
02:18 - how many years and I never used the
02:22 - modulus and a sign
02:23 - other than just teaching people what the
02:24 - modulus and a sign operator does so
02:27 - basically you're never going to use the
02:29 - modulus and a sign so wipe that out of
02:31 - your memory and yeah I probably should
02:34 - edit that out at the tutorial but
02:36 - anyways I won't so aside from that the
02:39 - other thing I want to teach you guys
02:40 - before I let you guys go is that you
02:42 - don't have to only use one of these you
02:44 - can go ahead and assign 67 to that and
02:46 - let me see if you guys can figure this
02:48 - out and go ahead and you know 32 and
02:53 - then Bucky x equals 4 and then Bucky um
03:01 - mult
03:02 - divided equals 5 or something like that
03:05 - so go ahead the original value of Bucky
03:08 - is 24 plus 67 minus 32 times 4/5 and I
03:16 - messed that up right there but I'm going
03:18 - to wait 10 seconds and I want you to
03:20 - leave a comment below of what you think
03:22 - this equals and let me see if anyone can
03:25 - figure this out in 10 seconds 9 8
03:32 - three two one and let's see what it was
03:36 - forty seven point two so how close were
03:39 - you to that hmm let me know in the
03:41 - comment section below because I bet you
03:43 - were way off because I was by anyways
03:46 - thank you guys for watching that's all I
03:48 - have for you guys for the story I just
03:49 - wanted to talk to you quick about
03:50 - assignment operators and don't forget
03:52 - don't ever use the modulus in assign
03:54 - operator I'll see you next time
