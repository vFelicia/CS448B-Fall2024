00:00 - hello YouTube Sam from youtube.com slash
00:04 - on live gamer here for the new Boston
00:06 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:08 - talking about variables now variables
00:10 - are one of the most important parts of
00:12 - programming there's no possible way to
00:14 - make a program without variables so
00:16 - let's go ahead and get started and we'll
00:18 - create a variable here now to create a
00:21 - variable in Visual Basic you're going to
00:22 - start off with the keyword dim now what
00:25 - this tells the compiler is that you're
00:27 - going to declare a variable so if you
00:30 - read this right here from intellisense
00:33 - it says that the dim statement declares
00:35 - and allocates all right here declares
00:39 - and allocates new storage space for one
00:41 - or more variables so what we're going to
00:44 - do is when the type dim and then after
00:46 - this you can type whatever name you want
00:48 - as long as it contains valid characters
00:50 - now there's a list that you can find a
00:52 - list of valid characters online or
00:55 - invalid characters so we're just going
00:57 - to start off by calling it my num now
01:00 - you can name this whatever you feel like
01:02 - and now after we tell the compiler what
01:07 - the name of our variable is going to be
01:08 - we're going to type as so this just says
01:11 - specifies the data type in the
01:13 - declaration statement so we're just
01:15 - going to tell the compiler what kind of
01:16 - data type is going to be and so we're
01:18 - going to make ours an integer and so you
01:23 - can see that a little green line comes
01:25 - under that and it is a warning here and
01:27 - it says unused local variable not mine
01:29 - um so when you're making programs if you
01:32 - never use a variable the error list is
01:35 - going to tell you the warning so that
01:37 - you can take that out and make your
01:38 - program more efficient but we're going
01:39 - to be using mine um so we're just going
01:41 - to ignore that warning for right now so
01:42 - now what we're going to do is we're
01:44 - going to assign my num
01:45 - so type my num equals 5 now if we do
01:51 - console dot write line
01:56 - my num and then we'll do console dot
02:01 - read line if we go ahead and run this
02:05 - it's going to say five right there now
02:10 - what we can do is we can instead of
02:13 - putting this in two lines we can go
02:15 - ahead and set the value of our variable
02:17 - in the declaration line so we can set it
02:21 - equal to five there now the reason I
02:23 - showed you the two line method before
02:25 - that is because sometimes you're going
02:26 - to be declaring a variable in one of
02:28 - your subs and then later on in your subs
02:30 - you're going to be assigning that to
02:31 - another value now that would be a way
02:33 - you wouldn't want to do that so for
02:35 - example if I run this
02:37 - let's go and run this it'll say five now
02:42 - if I come down here I set my num equal
02:44 - to something else such as seven if we go
02:47 - ahead and run this it's going to print
02:49 - out seven because even though we
02:52 - initialize mind I'm at five after we do
02:55 - that it's going to read it's going to
02:58 - change the value of mynum to seven and
03:00 - it's going to write the most recent
03:02 - value of mynum now doesn't save the old
03:04 - values it just updates it so it's going
03:07 - to start at five which changes to seven
03:09 - and it prints out the seven which is the
03:11 - what it's currently equal to so let's go
03:15 - ahead and work with a another time now
03:20 - QB color I want tab or not caps lock tab
03:24 - okay so let's go ahead and get rid of my
03:27 - num in here and we'll declare a string
03:30 - so dim my string as string and we're
03:35 - going to set it equal to hello the new
03:40 - Boston fans so now if we come down here
03:45 - and we console dot write line we're just
03:48 - going to put my string as the arguments
03:51 - and you can see that it prints out hello
03:54 - the new Boston fans
03:57 - now if we want to do a character we can
04:01 - just do dim my character as Kari or s
04:08 - char and we'll set it equal to a or M a
04:12 - and if we type out my character you can
04:19 - see that it will print out a for s now
04:23 - let's go ahead and do a double really
04:26 - quick so if we do double then equal set
04:30 - it equal to five point four we go ahead
04:33 - and run this it will say five point four
04:35 - for us now let's work with a balloon
04:39 - real quick if we create a boolean
04:41 - variable we'll set it equal to either
04:43 - true or false so set it equal to true
04:46 - and we'll print out my character over
04:52 - here let's change this to my pool
05:01 - now you can see here that it prints out
05:03 - true now we can also set this to false
05:08 - and if we run this it's going to print
05:11 - out false now here's something that I
05:14 - was going to teach you guys in a later
05:16 - tutorial but I figured that you guys are
05:18 - smart so I'll go ahead and teach it to
05:22 - you in this tutorial now whenever you
05:24 - create a variable let's just do let's
05:29 - create an integer and we'll set it equal
05:32 - to 5 what we want to do is in our Castle
05:35 - dot write line we want to take my num
05:38 - and we want to convert it to a string
05:42 - now you may not notice any difference
05:45 - any differences in this but I was taught
05:48 - that whenever you it's good coding
05:51 - practice to convert numbers to strings
05:53 - when you're going to be printing them
05:54 - out anywhere on the screen such as a
05:56 - label or a text box or a console which
05:58 - is what we are working in so to convert
06:02 - it to a string you just do the variable
06:04 - that you want dot to string with empty
06:07 - parameters and this is going to convert
06:08 - your integer to a string so now if we
06:11 - run this you can see it prints out five
06:13 - but instead of printing out a number
06:14 - this is actually a string so that's
06:20 - about all I wanted to cover in the
06:21 - variables tutorial so I'm practicing
06:24 - some variables make some of your own
06:27 - print them out get used to what they are
06:29 - and then once you've got that nailed
06:31 - down move on to the next tutorial and
