00:00 - okay so let's preview the front-end in
00:02 - our browser you can see it looks exactly
00:07 - like the example I showed you earlier so
00:09 - we've got settings' name and then our
00:11 - Save button so now that we have the
00:14 - initial form created or the front-end
00:17 - created we can go ahead and accept or
00:20 - start to handle the events when the Save
00:23 - button is clicked so the jQuery here is
00:28 - pretty simple the first thing that we
00:30 - want to do is check for an event handler
00:33 - so we're going to use a selector to
00:35 - select this button here this Save button
00:37 - so we hash Save button now when that's
00:41 - clicked we need to run a function and
00:44 - let's just pull that down inside here we
00:48 - need to do three things the first thing
00:49 - we need to do is grab the name or the
00:53 - value of the elements on our page so
00:57 - grab values now the first one is going
01:01 - to be name and obviously you can add
01:03 - subsequent values depending on how many
01:06 - fields exist in your form so for now we
01:11 - just have var name and then we're going
01:13 - to use a selector name Val and that's
01:16 - going to return the value of this field
01:20 - here this name field into this variable
01:22 - name what we then want to do is show
01:25 - loading text and essentially all we're
01:28 - doing here is we are changing the let's
01:32 - say save status span to the text loading
01:36 - so save status dot text
01:40 - loading now you might wonder why we
01:45 - create the loading text into here and
01:49 - then we continue now this is all really
01:52 - what we this is all we need really for a
01:54 - loading for loading text to be displayed
01:56 - we essentially just pop the text save
02:00 - status into here so for example now if I
02:03 - was to press this button you have this
02:05 - loading text here
02:06 - now when the Ajax request or the HTTP
02:09 - request is complete we can then change
02:12 - the text of this and update that to that
02:17 - we've successfully saved or that there
02:19 - has been an error and therefore in the
02:21 - meantime while while the Ajax request is
02:23 - loading and the data is being sent this
02:27 - will always be displayed so that's an
02:29 - easy way to create our loading symbol or
02:32 - you know this could even be dot HTML and
02:36 - you can go ahead and place some kind of
02:38 - image in there that would you know show
02:42 - the loading status of it some websites
02:46 - use images and now we want to send or
02:50 - perform HTTP requests and this is the
02:57 - post request so is sending post data to
03:00 - settings PHP okay so before we do
03:05 - anything else and before we start to
03:06 - send this data from here into our
03:10 - settings dot PHP file let's go ahead and
03:13 - set up in its PHP which stands for
03:15 - initialization or initiation and the
03:19 - first thing we want to do is start a
03:21 - session this is so we can make use of
03:24 - sessions like I said previously you
03:27 - might have may already have some kind of
03:28 - system to do this
03:30 - while this may be implemented already my
03:33 - session name is going to be user ID and
03:36 - this is going to be equal to one now
03:38 - this would vary depending on which user
03:39 - is logged in however I only want to
03:41 - update where one where one exists as a
03:45 - user in the database and that is just
03:48 - for the simple reason that we're not
03:50 - going to be creating a whole
03:51 - registration system
03:53 - in this tutorial the next thing we want
03:55 - to do is connect to the MySQL server and
03:58 - we are connecting to localhost the
04:02 - username is root and the password in
04:05 - this case is nothing I'm then going to
04:09 - select a specific database and that is
04:12 - jQuery as we've already seen in PHP
04:15 - myadmin the database name is jQuery okay
04:19 - so now that we've done that we don't
04:20 - need that file anymore to be open we
04:23 - don't need to well we will leave it open
04:24 - but we don't need to type anything else
04:26 - in there Settings dot PHP is going to
04:29 - include this init file so in it dot PHP
04:32 - because inside settings we're passing
04:35 - the values using post so we're passing
04:38 - this value inside of here to settings
04:42 - dot PHP so we need to include our
04:44 - database and session data in order to
04:47 - update our database correctly ok so
04:51 - inside Ajax es we need to send some data
04:55 - to a file that which is our first
04:57 - parameter and that is PHP forward slash
05:00 - settings dot PHP that's this file here
05:04 - the next thing we need to do is specify
05:06 - which data we are actually sending and
05:08 - the variable name so I'm going to call
05:11 - the variable name remember this is the
05:13 - name we pick up in PHP and then I'm
05:15 - going to send the data as this which is
05:18 - the name we picked up from here so this
05:20 - is the variable name that we pick up in
05:22 - settings dot PHP and this here is the
05:24 - actual value which is the name retrieved
05:27 - from the name field in our page and then
05:31 - going to create a callback function and
05:33 - give this a value of data and remember
05:35 - data is the value that has been returned
05:38 - from settings PHP so this will leave
05:42 - that data will now either be something
05:44 - like successfully updated your settings
05:48 - or could not update your settings so
05:51 - with data we want to go ahead and put
05:53 - that into an area on our page so we use
05:56 - a selector we select save status
06:01 - state us and then we say dot text data
06:07 - so whatever is returned from Settings
06:10 - dot PHP will now be put in to save
06:12 - status which remember is where this
06:14 - loading text is now so that will
06:17 - override this loading text here and then
06:20 - the loading will only be shown while the
06:23 - request is in place after the request
06:25 - has finished here the save status here
06:28 - will be changed to the data returned
06:31 - from settings dot PHP so an easy way to
06:34 - create a loading message while we're
06:38 - loading this page
