00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:04 - now in the last video looking at some of
00:08 - the jQuery utilities with regards to
00:10 - functions we looked at in array and this
00:13 - checked whether a particular value was
00:15 - present in an array in this video we're
00:18 - going to take a look at inserting values
00:20 - into arrays using just the standard
00:22 - JavaScript just standard JavaScript and
00:26 - not a jQuery and not the jQuery library
00:28 - but we're also going to be looking at
00:30 - the each utility or the each function
00:33 - and this will loop through element in an
00:36 - array and we're gonna just display them
00:38 - out on took you know area on our page so
00:41 - the first thing I want to go and do is
00:43 - just modify this form that we used in
00:44 - the last tutorial if you haven't already
00:46 - seen this tutorial all we have is an
00:48 - input box where we can type a user's
00:50 - name and then we have a button that in
00:52 - the last tutorial we use to check if
00:55 - this was in a particular array now what
00:58 - we're gonna do instead is change this
01:00 - value here just to insert and we're
01:03 - gonna allow the user to enter a name
01:06 - into this text box and then pop that
01:10 - into an array or push this into an array
01:11 - and then we're gonna be looping through
01:14 - the results and just displaying them out
01:15 - so they'll get instant feedback so let's
01:18 - go ahead and change this to insert as
01:20 - well as the value as well I'm gonna go
01:23 - ahead and create a just a div content
01:25 - area down here where we can list out
01:27 - these names and I'm just going to call
01:28 - that names so we've got util jeaious
01:31 - which i've included on my page and we
01:34 - can start writing out code in here the
01:36 - first thing I'm gonna do as with the
01:38 - majority of code you're right is
01:39 - document dot ready and inside here we'll
01:42 - have a function which we will then just
01:44 - pull down and inside here is all the
01:47 - code that we're going to use when the
01:49 - document is loaded okay so the first
01:52 - thing we want to go ahead and just and
01:53 - do is just outline a function that's
01:55 - going to loop through the the values in
01:58 - a particular array so I'm just gonna
01:59 - define this function and we're not going
02:01 - to fill it in just yet so the function
02:03 - is going to be called display
02:05 - oh right and underneath here I want to
02:09 - be able to check whether the insert
02:13 - button has been clicked so I'm going to
02:16 - go ahead and set up an event handler for
02:19 - our insert button so we use a ID
02:21 - selector to select insert and then we
02:24 - say dot click and then inside there we
02:27 - create our function and we just pull
02:29 - that down now just up here after the
02:31 - function definition and before this
02:33 - event handler I'm gonna go ahead and a
02:35 - create a an array called names I'm gonna
02:38 - just put three values into this so one
02:40 - two three and the first one just Alex
02:45 - Billy and then Dale so we now have this
02:48 - names array so what we want to do is
02:50 - when the user clicks insert we want to
02:53 - retrieve the value let's just refresh we
02:56 - want to retrieve the value from here put
02:58 - that into an array and then we're going
02:59 - to use our function to just list
03:01 - everything in the array down here on a
03:03 - line by line basis so the first thing we
03:06 - want to do inside of our click function
03:07 - is grab the name so I'm going to create
03:09 - a new variable called name and again we
03:12 - use an ID selector to select the name
03:14 - text area and we just take the value
03:17 - from that using Val okay so now what we
03:20 - want to do is go ahead and pop that into
03:22 - the array or push this into the array
03:24 - sorry
03:24 - so we use names which is our a name up
03:27 - here and we use dot push and dot push is
03:30 - just going to take a value or a set of
03:32 - values that we want to put into the
03:34 - array so we could specify them like this
03:36 - or we could specify just one element and
03:39 - that's just going to be name so the name
03:41 - that's currently that's been entered
03:43 - once the button has been clicked that
03:45 - goes into the array and then we call it
03:47 - the display array function we also want
03:50 - to go ahead and call the display array
03:52 - function just down here so as soon as
03:55 - the user lands on the page the array is
03:58 - displayed as well so now that we've done
04:00 - this all we've essentially done is
04:02 - created our array with three values in
04:05 - to begin with we're displaying these
04:07 - values initially to the user and then
04:09 - once they click the insert button it
04:11 - will take the value from the name input
04:14 - field
04:14 - here and that will push that into the
04:17 - array and then it will just redisplay
04:19 - the array so that we've got enough to do
04:21 - now is use the each utility which is the
04:24 - whole point of this tutorial to actually
04:27 - display this now the first thing we want
04:29 - to go ahead and do is just clear the
04:31 - names div so I'm just gonna say names
04:33 - text and then we'll just enter an empty
04:37 - value in there now what we want to do is
04:39 - go ahead and loop through all of our
04:41 - results so at the moment when i refresh
04:43 - and type in a name let's just say Ashley
04:48 - the array now contains the values Alex
04:51 - Billy Dale and Ashley but obviously we
04:55 - haven't displayed this to the user yet
04:57 - so we need to use dollar dot each and
05:01 - then we fill this in to actually loop
05:03 - through particular results from a
05:05 - specified array so this is going to take
05:08 - two parameters and then we have a
05:09 - callback function with two additional
05:11 - parameters and what we want to do is say
05:14 - names and that's the name of the array
05:18 - so we've specified the name of the array
05:20 - which is names and then we want our
05:22 - callback function just here I want to go
05:25 - ahead and just pull that down and inside
05:27 - a function we're gonna take two
05:28 - parameters or feedback two parameters
05:30 - and that's index and value so index is
05:34 - the position that each element is
05:35 - located at so for example Alex is
05:37 - located at zero Billy at one day lat -
05:40 - and then so on and value will be Alex
05:43 - Billy and Dale so we can also point out
05:45 - where the the elements are located so
05:49 - this is would be good for you know
05:50 - searching in an array and then you know
05:52 - modifying an array perhaps taking values
05:55 - out and putting new values in so it's
05:57 - extremely you know powerful way to hold
05:59 - data as I'm sure you already know if you
06:02 - program before so now what I want to do
06:04 - is for each name I want to go ahead and
06:06 - append this to the names div so I'm
06:12 - going to say name names dot append
06:15 - and in here we want to append on the
06:18 - value and then we want to append some
06:20 - text and then the in there are sorry
06:22 - yeah the index so I'm gonna say value ie
06:26 - Alex Billy or Dale or anything else I'm
06:31 - an actual fact no we don't need to do
06:32 - that that was from the last tutorial
06:33 - sorry what we want to do is display the
06:35 - value and then a line break okay so got
06:39 - a bit ahead of myself but yeah we've got
06:40 - the value and then a line break so at
06:42 - the moment when we enter the page we
06:44 - call this display array function and
06:46 - what it will do is it all it'll show
06:48 - Alex and then a line break and Billy
06:50 - then a line break and then Dale and then
06:52 - another line break so when we add
06:53 - another value in it will just keep
06:55 - appending to this list and remember the
06:57 - function does the display error sorry
07:00 - the display array function clears this
07:02 - before it really fills the div with this
07:05 - data just so we don't get duplicate data
07:07 - so let's go ahead and just refresh you
07:10 - can see that we've now got Alex Billy
07:12 - and Dow in a list and what we can then
07:14 - do is go ahead and enter a name so when
07:17 - we click insert we'll just run through
07:19 - it again we have the handler here we
07:22 - grab the value from the text field we
07:24 - add it to the right and then we again
07:25 - call the display array function so that
07:28 - will just display that back out so when
07:30 - I click insert you can see that that's
07:32 - just pushed on to the end of the array
07:34 - so we can go ahead and type in you know
07:36 - a variety of names and they'll just be
07:39 - added to the array so a somewhat useless
07:42 - application you know depending on you
07:45 - know you might want to go ahead and and
07:46 - use it somewhere else but a somewhat
07:49 - useless application but it demonstrates
07:50 - the use of each and also you know sort
07:53 - of like an original JavaScript
07:55 - functionality with regards to pushing a
07:57 - value onto an array so hopefully you've
08:00 - learned a bit about arrays and also
08:02 - looping through arrays and as I
08:04 - mentioned before if you want to go ahead
08:05 - and hold data in the front end in
08:08 - JavaScript variables and it's lots of
08:10 - data that obviously belonged to one
08:12 - category or one you know group you can
08:14 - go ahead and use a raise because it's
08:16 - extremely powerful and jQuery does have
08:19 - some utilities that do deal with arrays
08:21 - so go ahead to the jQuery documentation
08:23 - lookup utilities and see what other
08:26 - things you can do with arrays
08:27 - such as converting etc so yeah that's a
08:31 - the each utility in jQuery
