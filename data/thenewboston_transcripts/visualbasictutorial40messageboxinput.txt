00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:06 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:08 - taking a look at message boxes and what
00:11 - we're going to do is we're going to get
00:12 - what the user has selected so let's say
00:15 - we choose message box buttons dot abort
00:19 - retry and ignore well we're going to get
00:23 - which one they clicked and then do
00:25 - something according to that so let's go
00:27 - ahead and create a new project and let's
00:32 - go ahead and call it more message boxes
00:38 - select windows forms application and
00:41 - click OK now let's go ahead and resize
00:49 - the form and now let's show our tool box
00:54 - and we'll add a button now let's go
00:59 - ahead and rename this to button message
01:04 - and then we'll go ahead and double click
01:06 - on this now this is going to open up the
01:09 - event handler for that and we'll go
01:12 - ahead and zoom in some so now what we're
01:16 - going to do is we're going to show a
01:18 - message box so we'll type message box
01:21 - dot show and for our arguments we're
01:29 - going to use click something for the
01:37 - message and then we'll just do title for
01:41 - the title and then we'll do message box
01:44 - buttons dot abort retry ignore and now
01:51 - for our last argument we'll just do
01:53 - message box icon dot question
02:03 - okay so now that shows this message box
02:06 - we are going to create an if statement
02:08 - around this message box so what we're
02:11 - going to do is we're going to type if
02:12 - right here
02:14 - so if message box I'll show and it's got
02:18 - our abort retry and ignore so if that
02:22 - equals just type in a board and we can
02:29 - see right here that we've got windows
02:31 - forums dot dialog result dot abort so
02:36 - what this does is it tests to see if the
02:40 - user has clicked abort so it's got
02:42 - window stop forms because the message
02:44 - box is stored under the windows dot
02:47 - forms and then we've got dialog result
02:49 - which is the result of what they clicked
02:51 - in the message box and then we've got
02:53 - dot abort now there's other stuff we can
02:56 - use here we can use cancel ignore no
02:59 - none okay retry and yes so we're just
03:02 - going to do abort so now we're going to
03:10 - add an ENDIF right here so we can get
03:14 - rid of that error showing up so now what
03:17 - we're going to do is we're going to type
03:19 - message box dot show and we'll type
03:24 - aborted so they know that they have
03:26 - aborted whether whatever operation it is
03:29 - even though there isn't one this is just
03:31 - a demo program so now we can run this
03:38 - and you can see here that we've got form
03:40 - one and we can click button one and
03:43 - it'll tell us to click something and
03:44 - then when we click abort you can see
03:47 - that it shows a message box that says
03:49 - aborted now if we go ahead and run this
03:52 - and click something else other than a
03:54 - board like retry it's just going to
03:56 - close out of that
03:58 - so here I'll zoom out a bit here so you
04:01 - can see all of this code or that's not
04:07 - going to work so if message box I show
04:09 - and then we've got our message box and
04:12 - then we set the message box buttons to
04:14 - abort
04:14 - try ignore so if that equals abort then
04:18 - go ahead and tell them that it is has
04:21 - aborted now my challenge for you guys is
04:23 - to add some else if statements that
04:26 - we'll handle if they type something
04:29 - other than I mean if they click
04:32 - something other than abort so let's say
04:33 - if they click retry it's going to
04:35 - message box not show retrying you can
04:39 - also put this in a select case statement
04:42 - which is more efficient than an if
04:43 - statement so go ahead and practice this
04:46 - this might be a little bit confusing for
04:48 - you at first but you'll get the hang of
04:50 - it and once you got this down go ahead
04:53 - and move on to the next tutorial thanks
04:56 - for watching guys
