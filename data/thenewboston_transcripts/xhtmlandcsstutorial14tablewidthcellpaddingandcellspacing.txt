00:00 - what's up guys welcome to your
00:01 - fourteenth XHTML and CSS tutorial and in
00:04 - this tutorial I want to talk to you guys
00:06 - about table width but before I get
00:08 - started I want to tell you guys that if
00:10 - you're following along with my last
00:12 - tutorial
00:12 - you're noticed that I took out that big
00:15 - title at the top that says odd people
00:16 - because for this tutorial it will just
00:19 - confuse you if you leave it in so go
00:21 - ahead and take that out and make sure
00:22 - that your table only has regular table
00:25 - headers and table data in it so once you
00:28 - have a basic table you can continue so
00:31 - what I want to talk to you guys about
00:33 - like I said is table width now by
00:36 - default whenever you create a table it's
00:39 - gonna adjust the width automatically to
00:41 - however long the longest piece of data
00:44 - is so this is the longest piece of data
00:46 - so that is how long the column needs to
00:49 - be and you see this column is shorter so
00:52 - that's why this is that shorter so it
00:54 - makes sense right but what if you say
00:57 - alright the table would look a lot
00:59 - better on my web page if it was just a
01:01 - little bit wider well actually this is
01:04 - possible with XHTML and it's really
01:07 - simple to do you can adjust the width of
01:09 - your table in two ways aside from border
01:12 - table has another attribute called can
01:15 - you guess it width there you go one
01:19 - point for you and you can adjust the
01:21 - width like I said in one of two ways
01:22 - the first thing that you can do is just
01:25 - write a number and whenever you write a
01:27 - number in there it will adjust that many
01:30 - pixels exactly so let's go ahead and
01:32 - save this and refresh and check it out
01:35 - and now adjusts the 500 pixels so now
01:39 - your table is 500 pixels wide regardless
01:42 - of how long the data is inside it so
01:45 - that's pretty cool another way you can
01:47 - adjust the width is to give it a
01:49 - percentage and if you go ahead and give
01:51 - it something like 100 percent it's going
01:54 - to adjust to a hundred percent of the
01:57 - width of your website so let's go ahead
01:59 - and save this and check it out it now
02:01 - takes up a hundred percent width so if
02:04 - you go ahead and shrink this check it
02:06 - out it's still taking up a hundred
02:08 - percent no matter how small or how long
02:11 - it goes
02:13 - it changes dynamically based on how wide
02:17 - your browser is so we're saying all
02:19 - right I don't know how big their screens
02:21 - gonna be but I know I want my table to
02:23 - take up a hundred percent of the space
02:26 - that is how you can use that a
02:28 - percentage of you know instead of a
02:31 - number what would just be pixels you can
02:33 - use a percentage that's what I was
02:35 - trying to say so that is how you can
02:37 - adjust the width of your table and now I
02:40 - want to talk to you guys about another
02:42 - thing that you can add and let's go
02:44 - ahead and get rid of this width because
02:45 - it would just confuse you so let's go
02:48 - ahead and keep the border and now I want
02:50 - to talk to you guys about a concept
02:51 - called cell padding and cell spacing so
02:54 - let's go ahead and save this and refresh
02:56 - it let's see there we go refresh until
03:00 - we just got a normal table you might be
03:02 - saying all right Bucky this table is
03:04 - looking pretty dang good but
03:06 - everything's just too clustered together
03:08 - I need some space in between this text
03:10 - and the border or I just kind of neat
03:13 - things spaced out some more to make it
03:14 - easier to read well that is also
03:16 - possible with XHTML and you do that with
03:19 - an attribute there's two different
03:21 - attributes one's called cell padding and
03:24 - once called cell spacing let's go ahead
03:26 - and start with cell padding self padding
03:29 - is the idea that it gives you space
03:32 - between your text in this case and the
03:36 - border so whatever content is inside in
03:39 - this case the word cat people and the
03:41 - border you can write an amount in there
03:43 - and that's how many pixels it's going to
03:45 - give you it's a space so let's go ahead
03:47 - and make this ten pixels and check it
03:49 - out you see how everything is kind of
03:51 - tied up the text is kind of bumped up
03:53 - against the border let's refresh it and
03:55 - check it out
03:56 - we now have some padding around the text
03:59 - or the contents of your table and the
04:03 - border so I mean that's what cell
04:05 - padding is pretty much puts pads in your
04:07 - cell maybe that's where they come up
04:10 - with it who knows so now let's change
04:12 - over to something called cell spacing
04:16 - spell sit cell say Singh what I was
04:19 - gonna say spell chasing I think what the
04:22 - heck does that mean cell spacing
04:25 - the idea that you have space between
04:28 - yourselves themselves so instead of
04:31 - having padding around your text you're
04:33 - gonna be having space between your
04:36 - individual cells so let's go ahead and
04:37 - refresh this you hear that siren let's
04:41 - see what's going on I'm probably just a
04:42 - bank robbery or a homicide or something
04:44 - no big deal I'm just gonna keep talking
04:46 - so let's go ahead and i refresh this
04:51 - yeah that's kind of annoying and it's
04:53 - kind of distracting me so yeah it's
04:57 - getting louder oh my god they're coming
05:01 - right here anyways so now you can see
05:03 - that cell spacing is a space between the
05:05 - cells themselves the text is still
05:07 - bumped up against the border but the
05:09 - cells are separated from each other a
05:11 - little bit kind of like giving yourself
05:13 - a thicker thicker border so anyways
05:16 - that's the difference between cell
05:17 - padding and cell spacing a lot of people
05:20 - get that confused but hopefully I
05:21 - explained it so you guys understand what
05:23 - it means and now you would know when to
05:25 - use one and when to use the other so
05:27 - between you know adjusting your border
05:29 - your table width your cell padding in
05:32 - your cell spacing and also with colspan
05:34 - and stuff you can pretty much get any
05:36 - type of table that you want so there is
05:40 - basically the basics to tables so now
05:43 - that you guys understand this you're
05:44 - ready to move on to the next subject
05:46 - what it is I don't know but anyways it's
05:49 - gonna be awesome so anyways thank you
