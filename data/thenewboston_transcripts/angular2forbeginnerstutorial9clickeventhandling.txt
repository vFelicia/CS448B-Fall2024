00:00 - alright so in the last video what we did
00:02 - is we set up our component to display
00:04 - all of these videos but now what I want
00:08 - to do is this I want to have it so
00:09 - whenever the user clicks one of these
00:11 - rows that the video appears at the
00:14 - bottom right here so the first thing we
00:16 - have to figure out is how do we just
00:17 - listen for click events and the way that
00:20 - you do that is this so we want to listen
00:24 - for click events on the row so it
00:27 - doesn't matter what commonly click we
00:28 - just want to listen for it anywhere on
00:30 - the row wherever they click so on this
00:33 - row tag right here what we're going to
00:36 - do is this in between parentheses go
00:39 - ahead and right click so set this equal
00:42 - to some attribute and this is how in
00:45 - angler you can listen for click events
00:48 - or any events so whenever a click occurs
00:51 - on this row then it's going to trigger
00:54 - whatever we type in here which is going
00:56 - to be some method now we don't have any
00:58 - here let me close out of all this extra
01:01 - crap so in our class we don't have any
01:03 - methods created yet but we will in just
01:05 - a second and we can name this anything
01:07 - we want I'm just going to name this on
01:09 - select so whenever we call this method
01:12 - we actually want to pass in this video
01:16 - so that way it knows exactly what video
01:19 - to display and again remember whenever
01:21 - we're looping through these videos each
01:24 - individual video is referenced as V so
01:28 - there you go so again whenever you want
01:31 - to listen for click events just right
01:33 - click equals and then set it equal to
01:36 - some method so now in here we can
01:41 - actually go ahead and make that method
01:42 - but check this out we actually need to
01:45 - import this video class right here so
01:48 - I'm just going to set it up to display
01:51 - the video and before you even do that
01:53 - before I actually output the actual HTML
01:55 - code I'm just going to display some
01:58 - basic information just to test things
02:00 - maybe the title or something
02:02 - so anyways whenever we're using this
02:05 - video class we need to import
02:09 - video from video all right so what did I
02:17 - name that on select alright so on select
02:22 - what we're going to do is this we need
02:24 - to make a variable and I'll just name it
02:27 - a I might as well just keep it V
02:29 - actually let me name it bin so you guys
02:31 - can see that it's actually different and
02:32 - of course whenever you're working in
02:35 - typescript you need to write what data
02:37 - type it is so this of course is just the
02:40 - type of video so there you go
02:42 - and for this tutorial like I said
02:45 - eventually what we're going to be doing
02:47 - is we're going to be displaying the HTML
02:49 - code but for now just so we can keep
02:52 - things real simple and make sure that
02:53 - this click event actually works is I'm
02:55 - just going to print something out to the
02:57 - console so console.log and jason
03:00 - stringify that vid so all this does is
03:06 - it takes whatever object
03:08 - this is turns into a JSON string and it
03:12 - just prints it out in the console so
03:14 - this should work hopefully now we for
03:17 - this to refresh and check it out and by
03:20 - the way whenever it prints it out to the
03:22 - console I'm not talking about this
03:24 - console right here I'm talking about the
03:26 - console in Chrome so if you want to open
03:29 - that then you can either just open up
03:31 - your developer tools or a shortcut if
03:34 - you're using Windows is ctrl shift and J
03:37 - so it'll pop open your console so now
03:40 - let me just go ahead and click this row
03:42 - and check it out all of the JSON
03:45 - information prints out right there boom
03:49 - boom boom boom looks like everything is
03:51 - working beautifully
03:52 - now again know whenever I click this
03:54 - first one it is indeed displaying
03:56 - information about that first video
03:58 - whenever I click the second one it's
04:00 - displaying information about the second
04:02 - video so later on what we're going to do
04:04 - is instead of just printing stuff out we
04:06 - need to say hey actually pop up a video
04:11 - right under here
