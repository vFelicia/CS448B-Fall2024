00:00 - so very center do width and we want to
00:04 - do the same again so object height is
00:07 - equal
00:08 - to very center.
00:12 - height so now we can do exactly the same
00:14 - thing we'll go ahead and alert out the
00:16 - object width and height and this will
00:18 - actually match 150 and 250 so we need to
00:21 - make sure that that that happens because
00:23 - we need to be extremely accurate so
00:25 - again we can go ahead and say width x
00:29 - height X X obviously go ahead and just
00:31 - replace these X variables with object
00:36 - width
00:38 - and object height so let's go ahead and
00:42 - refresh and you see we've got width 250
00:44 - and height 150 which nicely matches this
00:48 - height 150 width 250 so we know that
00:51 - these values are accurate uh we don't
00:53 - really have a way of testing that these
00:55 - values are accurate well we do but we're
00:57 - not going to do it uh but we can just uh
00:59 - you know assuming that we've grabbed the
01:02 - um absolute height and width of this
01:04 - object which is the very sensitive we
01:07 - know that we've Define them uh
01:08 - properties in here uh so we know that
01:11 - width and height are working okay so now
01:14 - what we need to do is actually calculate
01:16 - uh where we're going to place this div
01:19 - so the very center div needs to be
01:20 - placed in the very center of the window
01:23 - so what we want to do is we want to set
01:26 - the very center CSS s and remember I
01:31 - said earlier we specified well we can
01:33 - specify top 200 pixels or 100 pixels or
01:36 - whatever um in here but what I'm going
01:39 - to do is I'm going to set top to
01:42 - something here and then I'm going to go
01:45 - ahead and set left to something here so
01:49 - we need to set the uh top and the left
01:52 - to uh the very center of the screen now
01:55 - we can't just go ahead and Supply window
01:57 - width and window height divided by two
01:59 - which which we would normally think uh
02:01 - would work so let's just go ahead and
02:03 - try that so I'm going to say
02:05 - window width oh no this would be height
02:08 - CU it's from the top height divided by
02:10 - two and the left we can say window width
02:14 - ided by two uh let's just go and preview
02:17 - that uh you can see that we're a bit off
02:19 - because we've divided the height and the
02:21 - width by two uh so this corner here is
02:24 - half of the page width or the page
02:26 - height and this same corner is half of
02:29 - the page width but what we need to do is
02:31 - we need to subtract half of the value of
02:34 - the height and width of this object in
02:36 - order to place the middle of this div
02:39 - here at this point here and then it will
02:42 - be absolutely Central so hopefully that
02:44 - makes sense um hopefully I've explained
02:47 - it properly so for the window height we
02:49 - want to
02:51 - subtract object height divided two and
02:56 - for the window width we want to sub
02:59 - subract object width divided by two so
03:03 - now when we go ahead and we refresh you
03:06 - can see that's been placed in the middle
03:07 - because we've replaced this corner we've
03:09 - subtracted half of this object so we now
03:13 - see that the object is in the very
03:14 - center of the screen now we only have
03:16 - one more problem and that is that when I
03:18 - go ahead and resize this it doesn't
03:20 - actually move because we've set a static
03:23 - value for the uh height and the width of
03:25 - this object so what we want to do is we
03:28 - want to go ahead and first of all call
03:30 - this uh function that will place it in
03:32 - the middle of the window but we then
03:35 - want to create an event handler for
03:37 - window which is resize and this event
03:41 - handler or the function inside here that
03:42 - I'm just going to outline here uh
03:44 - everything inside here will be will be
03:47 - called every time we go ahead and resize
03:49 - the window so for example if I was to
03:52 - say
03:55 - alert resize has taken place and I
04:00 - refresh and then I start you can see my
04:02 - cursor over here I start to drag it in
04:04 - resize has taken place and that's sort
04:07 - of like alerting all that out and going
04:09 - I drag it back again resize is taking
04:11 - place uh so we know that every time we
04:13 - resize we have this alert box you know
04:16 - pop up however what we want to happen is
04:19 - move div and that's it because what's
04:22 - going to happen now is it's going to
04:24 - regain or regrab the window height and
04:27 - the um the window width and the window
04:29 - height
04:30 - uh the object width I guess isn't really
04:32 - important that could be moved outside of
04:34 - the function uh however then we then we
04:36 - reassign the top and left values because
04:39 - we're calling this function every time
04:41 - we resize the window so now when we
04:43 - refresh and we go ahead and resize this
04:46 - value this top and this left value in
04:48 - CSS is constantly updated so we can you
04:51 - know move this around however we like uh
04:54 - but it's staying in the center of the uh
04:57 - of the window so just just by using
05:00 - width and height and a little common
05:01 - sense with regards to these calculations
05:04 - uh we can set the CSS uh top property
05:06 - and the CSS left property to these uh
05:09 - values every time we resize uh by just
05:12 - gaining the width and the height of the
05:14 - window as we actually resize the window
05:17 - so again quite a messy way of doing it
05:19 - uh it would be better placed into a
05:21 - plugin uh and then we could call the
05:23 - plugin on any object we wanted and we
05:25 - could use uh this just like here or this
05:29 - like that you know instead of actually
05:31 - going ahead and using uh the reference
05:33 - for very center but you get the idea if
05:36 - you know how to create a plugin why not
05:38 - go ahead and try to place this into or
05:40 - place this code or incorporate this code
05:42 - into a plugin uh it's quite a useful way
05:46 - of centering things uh particularly if
05:48 - you're creating more of a dynamic site
05:50 - that you want something to stay in the
05:51 - center uh Etc so quite a useful uh you
05:55 - know piece of knowledge of how to center
05:57 - something exactly and then resize it or
06:00 - replace it every time the window is
06:03 - resized
