00:00 - hi this is alex from phpacademy.org and
00:02 - welcome to a video for the new boston
00:05 - now in this tutorial we're going to take
00:07 - a look at another manipulation function
00:09 - in jquery and that is clone now we're
00:11 - going to be using the same application
00:13 - that we developed for append and append
00:16 - 2
00:17 - or append 2 rather because we
00:19 - essentially took a value here
00:22 - and we placed it here using the append 2
00:25 - function and that just moved this
00:27 - element inside of here so let me just go
00:29 - through this for those of you that were
00:31 - either unclear or haven't seen the
00:33 - append 2 video we're taking an input
00:35 - button and we
00:37 - well when we click it let me just move
00:39 - this down
00:40 - when we click it we're taking this span
00:42 - here and replacing it and appending it
00:45 - to the end of this paragraph now we do
00:48 - this using the following code and just
00:49 - append to paragraph so the span with my
00:53 - name is or sorry the span with alex in
00:56 - it is appended to the end of the
00:57 - paragraph
00:58 - which says my name is now the problem is
01:02 - here is that we
01:04 - instead of actually just taking a copy
01:06 - of this we're just moving the element
01:08 - and appending it on now to fix this we
01:11 - can use the clone functionality
01:14 - so if you have uh you know attempted to
01:17 - append one element onto another and you
01:20 - just want a copy of it to be created we
01:22 - can actually make a simple change to the
01:25 - code that we're currently using and
01:27 - actually then clone the element and then
01:29 - append it on
01:31 - so in fact what we do is we simply just
01:33 - um
01:35 - after our span we would we would just
01:37 - say clone
01:39 - and then dot append two so we've got the
01:41 - span here we're cloning the span and
01:44 - then we're appending it to the paragraph
01:47 - so instead of this happening where we
01:49 - take the element up here and just
01:51 - completely move it to the end of this
01:53 - element will actually receive a copy of
01:55 - the element and then it will just take
01:57 - it and append it onto the end as a copy
02:00 - so you can see now that using the clone
02:02 - function will clone an element and then
02:05 - append it to
02:06 - rather than just appending two and
02:08 - moving the element altogether
