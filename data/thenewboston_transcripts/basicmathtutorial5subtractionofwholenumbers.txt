00:01 - welcome to subtraction with whole
00:02 - numbers just like addition you start in
00:04 - the ones place
00:05 - only you do it subtraction
00:07 - so nine minus one is eight
00:12 - four minus seven you can't do that so we
00:14 - have to borrow from the six
00:16 - make that a five
00:19 - make that a fourteen fourteen minus
00:21 - seven is seven
00:24 - five minus eight cannot do that we have
00:25 - to borrow from the five again make that
00:27 - a six
00:29 - fifteen
00:31 - so
00:32 - fifteen minus eight
00:35 - is seven
00:38 - and six minus one is
00:41 - five
00:43 - so there's our answer
00:46 - so over here 4 minus 5. to borrow from
00:49 - the 5 make that a 4 put the 1 right
00:51 - there making that a 14 minus 5 is 9.
00:56 - 4 minus seven cannot do it borrow from
00:59 - the two make that a one make that at
01:00 - fourteen
01:02 - fourteen minus seven is seven
01:04 - one minus six we have to borrow from the
01:06 - eight make that a seven
01:09 - make that eleven
01:10 - eleven minus six is five
01:15 - and seven minus three is four
01:23 - over here we have six minus seven bar
01:24 - from the two make that a one make that a
01:26 - sixteen
01:28 - that's going to be nine sixteen minus
01:30 - seven is nine
01:32 - so it's a borrow from the three make
01:34 - that a two make that eleven
01:37 - so eleven minus eight is three
01:42 - two minus four i can't do it the borrow
01:44 - from the seven make that a six
01:47 - and that's gonna be 12 minus four is
01:51 - eight
01:53 - and then six minus three is
01:56 - three
02:00 - so over here three minus eight borrow
02:02 - from the four make that a three
02:05 - make that a thirteen
02:07 - so 8 9 10 11 12 13 is five
02:13 - three minus seven can't do that the bar
02:15 - from the one make that a zero
02:18 - make that thirteen
02:21 - thirteen minus seven is six
02:26 - zero minus nine borrow from the nine
02:28 - make that eight make that a ten ten
02:30 - minus nine is
02:33 - one
02:35 - and eight minus one is
02:38 - seven
02:42 - over here two minus seven need to borrow
02:44 - from the three make that a two
02:46 - make that a twelve
02:49 - 7 7 minus 12 is
02:51 - or 12 minus 7 is 5.
02:56 - 2 minus 8 can't do that borrow from the
02:58 - 5 make that a 4.
03:00 - 12 minus 8 is four
03:05 - four minus six can't do a spar from this
03:07 - six make that a five make that a
03:09 - fourteen
03:11 - it's going to be eight fourteen minus
03:13 - six is eight
03:15 - five minus two is three
03:18 - those are our answers for
03:20 - those ones
03:22 - and when you get good at placement you
03:23 - can do it horizontally
03:25 - so 8 minus 2 make sure you go from left
03:28 - to right
03:29 - 8 minus 2 is six
03:32 - put the six way over here
03:35 - and then nine minus five is four
03:41 - forty-six
03:44 - nine minus eight is one
03:47 - six minus seven can't do that to borrow
03:50 - from the six
03:51 - make that a five oh sorry bar from the
03:54 - four
03:56 - make this a sixteen make that a three
04:01 - so 16 minus seven is
04:05 - nine
04:09 - and we have three minus two is one and
04:12 - then one minus 1 is 0. so you don't have
04:15 - to include it
04:17 - you don't need to include any leading
04:18 - zeros
04:19 - but it's very important to include
04:22 - the following zeros
04:24 - so 1 minus 3
04:26 - can't do that to borrow from the two
04:30 - make that a one put the one right there
04:33 - and that's going to be eight
04:38 - one minus four can do i have to borrow
04:40 - from the seven make that a six
04:42 - change that to an eleven
04:44 - and we have seven
04:52 - six minus nine can't do that to borrow
04:55 - from the six make that a five
04:58 - sixteen
05:00 - that's gonna be
05:01 - seven
05:02 - and five minus one is
05:06 - four
05:09 - and that is our answer
05:12 - and that's all i have for
05:14 - subtraction with whole numbers
