00:00 - what's going on guys it's Bucky and
00:02 - welcome to your 46th xht m in CSS
00:05 - tutorial and this my friends is a
00:08 - tutorial that all of you guys have been
00:10 - waiting for in this lesson I'm finally
00:12 - going to teach you guys how to take your
00:15 - website that you've been working on in
00:16 - your own you know maybe your bedroom or
00:19 - maybe at school and I'm going to teach
00:21 - you guys how to publish it on the
00:23 - worldwide web so finally we are going
00:26 - global with this baby taking it out and
00:29 - making it so the entire world can see
00:31 - our creation so let's go ahead enough of
00:34 - me talking let's go ahead and get
00:35 - started so go ahead and open google.com
00:38 - and the first thing we need to do is we
00:40 - need to find something called a web host
00:42 - or a web server so in order for everyone
00:46 - to have access to our website we just
00:48 - can't keep it on our computer because I
00:51 - mean I would hope no one else has access
00:53 - to your computer cuz if everyone in the
00:55 - world has access to that little dinky
00:57 - computer in your room then it would blow
00:59 - up and like like 3 seconds so we need to
01:01 - take those web files and put them on
01:04 - something called a web server now a web
01:07 - server is kind of different than a
01:08 - regular desktop it is basically a
01:11 - computer or in other words a chunk of
01:13 - memory on the internet a chunk of memory
01:16 - that you can put web files on and
01:18 - everyone in the world has access to them
01:21 - so then if you put your web files on
01:23 - your computer no one else can see them
01:25 - besides you if you put your web files on
01:27 - a web server everyone in the world
01:30 - can see them so that is how websites are
01:32 - created you put them on special
01:34 - computers card web servers and the
01:36 - entire public has access to them so in
01:39 - order to find a good cheap company we
01:41 - have of course go to Google cheap web
01:44 - hosting not hopsing hosting go ahead and
01:48 - press enter and just click the first
01:49 - link that comes up and these companies
01:52 - are changing all the time so it's good
01:54 - to get a review of which ones are the
01:56 - best but anyways um like HostGator I use
01:58 - that before that's a good one in motion
02:00 - that's a good one too um Host Monster
02:03 - that's the one I'm using right now
02:04 - that's a good one as well but anyways
02:05 - here are a huge list of companies that
02:08 - offer really cheap web hosting for
02:10 - example it could be as low as like you
02:12 - know two bucks a month to host a website
02:15 - so for example go ahead and go to one of
02:18 - these companies I'm going to go ahead
02:19 - and use Host Monster because I actually
02:22 - bought a domain a long time ago slack
02:25 - room.com and um you know I never used it
02:27 - or anything I just bought it when I was
02:29 - being stupid I was younger and anyways
02:32 - the process is this you go to one of
02:34 - these websites and you type in first of
02:37 - all you got to go ahead and click get
02:38 - started or something and you go ahead
02:40 - and you type in what website you want
02:43 - and most of the time they're already
02:44 - taken but go ahead and type in like
02:46 - Tom's chat.com or Dave blog.com whatever
02:50 - you want give me your credit card
02:51 - information and Bam you own the website
02:54 - that is your domain name no one else can
02:56 - have it of course you can't like buy
02:58 - Myspace or anything.com
03:00 - so anyways so now you own the website
03:03 - and you're back at this location right
03:05 - here what the heck are you supposed to
03:07 - do from here well from here they give
03:10 - you a place to log into your account and
03:13 - of course they give you your domain name
03:15 - right here and a password that you would
03:17 - have chosen whenever you first bought
03:19 - the account so I'm going to enter my
03:21 - password right there and I'm going to go
03:23 - ahead and log in and once you log in
03:26 - they take you to this thing called C
03:28 - panel now C panel is where you manage
03:31 - everything that can go on with your
03:32 - website now like 99% of these things you
03:36 - will never click most of this stuff is
03:38 - for web programming um if you want to
03:40 - buy more stuff email accounts but what
03:43 - we're focusing on is something called
03:46 - FTP now FTP is the process it's called
03:50 - file transfer protocol and your button
03:53 - might be a little different but my
03:55 - button is right here unlimited FTP so go
03:58 - ahead and click that and a program is
04:00 - going to open up that looks a lot like
04:02 - this there are a bunch of different FTB
04:04 - programs but this one is probably the
04:05 - most popular and the concept is this
04:09 - this is your computer right here and
04:11 - this is the web server and what we need
04:14 - to do is we need to take the files from
04:16 - over on our computer and transfer them
04:19 - to the web server now we just can't
04:21 - start clicking buttons we need to do
04:22 - this in a very specific way now the
04:26 - files that the public has access to are
04:29 - going to be stored in a folder called
04:31 - public HTML and check it out if you
04:33 - double click that you already have a
04:34 - bunch of files in there by default
04:36 - probably these are pretty much the error
04:38 - files and they might have gave you a
04:40 - default um HTML file so let's go ahead
04:44 - and go to slack.com and check it out see
04:48 - this is the default homepage they give
04:50 - you because you know you bought the
04:52 - website um they just wanted to give you
04:54 - something to stick up there make you buy
04:56 - a bunch of ads but what we want to do is
04:58 - we want to put our home homepage that we
05:00 - made on this domain because we paid good
05:02 - money for it so let's get our documents
05:04 - on there so anyways all of your files
05:07 - are going to go in this public HTML fold
05:10 - so how do you move your files from your
05:12 - computer over to there well first of all
05:15 - go ahead and where did you store your
05:18 - files mine were on my desktop in a
05:20 - folder called all XT all xhtml and again
05:26 - another thing I want to point out is
05:28 - make sure that your file is named
05:31 - index.html by default whenever a browser
05:34 - goes to the website they're going to
05:36 - scroll through this public HTML fold and
05:38 - they're going to look for a file that
05:40 - says index.html that's why it was so
05:43 - crucial to name it index.html if there's
05:46 - no index. HTML file then it's going to
05:49 - say you know website does not exist or
05:51 - something like that so make sure that
05:54 - you have at least one web page named
05:56 - index.html this is going to be your
05:58 - homepage so anyways all you have to do
06:01 - is Select that index.html file and press
06:04 - this upload selected files button or the
06:06 - right button this transfers the file
06:09 - from your computer to the web server and
06:12 - now your file check it out is on the web
06:15 - server so you pretty much moved it from
06:17 - your computer to the web server easy
06:19 - enough so now once you go ahead and go
06:22 - to slack room.com Let me refresh this oh
06:25 - yeah that's my website baby OMG I am
06:28 - live on the internet so this is actually
06:31 - a real website that I just went to now
06:34 - anyone in the world world can go to
06:36 - slack.com press enter and check it out
06:39 - my website pops up and again I only
06:42 - uploaded one web page but that is how
06:44 - you upload entire websites to the web
06:46 - server so it's pretty simple and then
06:49 - again anytime you want to update your
06:51 - website just go ahead in your text
06:53 - editor um change your index.html file
06:56 - and then come back in here upload it
06:58 - again it says the you want to overwrite
07:00 - it yes it uploads it again and it would
07:03 - be changed so anyways that is the basics
07:06 - of how you take a website that you
07:08 - created on your computer and upload it
07:10 - so the world can see again a couple of
07:13 - these things might be different um there
07:15 - are different types of C panels
07:17 - different versions this FTP right here
07:20 - um this is the most common one but there
07:22 - are different type of ftps but they're
07:23 - all basically the same that's the main
07:26 - concept behind the entire internet
07:28 - putting files on web servers so everyone
07:31 - has access to it so anyways that's all I
07:34 - have for you guys for now and that
07:36 - basically sums up web development and
07:40 - all the basics that we need to cover so
07:42 - maybe I'll make like um an example
07:44 - website but for the most part you guys
07:47 - now know how to make a basic website and
07:51 - publish it on the internet pretty cool
07:53 - hun so you know if you watch all these
07:55 - tutorials it only took you a couple
07:56 - hours and look how much you learn so
07:58 - from now now or from here rather I would
08:02 - recommend that you learn a language
08:04 - called JavaScript JavaScript is how you
08:07 - make web pages smarter more interactive
08:09 - more fun or what I would recommend is
08:12 - learning a language called PHP if you
08:14 - want to build games and social
08:16 - networking sites then PHP is an awesome
08:19 - start but for now again I want to thank
08:21 - you guys so much for sticking with me in
