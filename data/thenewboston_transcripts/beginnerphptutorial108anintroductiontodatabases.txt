00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org and
00:03 - I'm back now with another video for the
00:04 - new Boston this time we're going to be
00:07 - talking about databases now in this
00:09 - video I'm not going to teach you how to
00:11 - set up a database how to write data to
00:14 - etc etc but we're just going to talk
00:17 - about why a database is
00:19 - important in most real life um
00:22 - application
00:24 - situations um we're also going to be
00:26 - talking about a bit about the mySQL
00:28 - database now this is also called MySQL
00:31 - uh you may hear people call it my SQL
00:33 - but for the uh duration of these
00:35 - tutorials I'm going to be calling it
00:38 - MySQL okay so why do we need to use a
00:41 - database
00:43 - now you may have come across databases
00:46 - before in the format of say Excel um not
00:49 - Excel sorry access um and other database
00:52 - applications where you can store values
00:55 - with specific column names and you can
00:57 - store these values as a row I mean you
01:00 - can do that in Excel as well
01:02 - but okay so let's just get rid of these
01:04 - PHP tags and I'll take you through why
01:06 - we might want to store data in a
01:09 - database now if you've already looked at
01:11 - file handling you'll know that we've
01:13 - stored things we may have stored things
01:15 - like hit counter value in a file and
01:18 - then what we've done is we've opened the
01:19 - file up we've read the value in we've
01:22 - closed the file we may have then open
01:24 - the value uh the file up again to
01:25 - rewrite another value now this puts a
01:30 - huge amount of strain and complication
01:33 - as well on the whole process now let's
01:36 - say we wanted to write a value to a um
01:41 - to a file what we're doing is we're
01:43 - opening up that file so we're reading
01:45 - file data we are then um writing a value
01:49 - to a file what happens if we want say to
01:52 - include a
01:54 - username a
01:56 - password um a first name a
02:03 - surname and other data let's just say um
02:08 - website so you may have hundreds and
02:12 - hundreds of records with people a
02:15 - username their password and you may want
02:17 - to create some kind of login system for
02:19 - this now you're not going to do very
02:22 - well if you're using files to store this
02:25 - data you can by all means use files to
02:28 - store this data have however it's a lot
02:30 - more secure and it's also a lot quicker
02:33 - to use a database and in this case we're
02:35 - going to be using MySQL because it is
02:38 - one of the fastest databases available
02:40 - to use now MySQL is hosted on a server
02:44 - so it will have um it will have its own
02:46 - port number if we open up the xamp
02:49 - control panel you can see that I've got
02:51 - this process MySQL and it's running at
02:53 - the moment and I think it runs on by
02:56 - default let's have a look can't see uh
03:00 - let's stop it and then restart
03:02 - it so it's it's running on Port
03:05 - 3306 now from PHP you don't need to
03:08 - worry about this too much you don't need
03:11 - to worry about accessing it you know as
03:13 - a server but we do use um some functions
03:17 - to connect to our database and then we
03:19 - SE or connect to our server and then we
03:22 - uh use another function to connect to
03:24 - the database itself so you can have a
03:27 - variety amount of a variety of data
03:29 - databases within um MySQL and then you
03:33 - can have a variety of tables inside them
03:36 - databases now a database would be say
03:39 - users so this is my users database here
03:42 - I've got username so I'm going to say
03:44 - Alex password I'm going to put pass one
03:46 - two 3 first name is Alex surname is
03:49 - Garett and website PHP academy.org so
03:53 - I've already put one record in for
03:55 - myself now this could uh this uh table
03:58 - we're looking at here this is be a table
04:00 - could contain other data so we could say
04:02 - Billy again the password might be pass
04:05 - uh
04:06 - 456 Billy Garrett and uh we might not
04:11 - have a
04:12 - website so um we are storing essentially
04:16 - data in this way now the way we can
04:18 - access it access this is we can select
04:21 - our
04:22 - table what we can then do
04:26 - um yeah so this is our table our
04:29 - database name uh we'll just say table
04:32 - users our database name might be called
04:37 - um uh PHP Academy for example um and our
04:42 - table might be called
04:46 - users so now what we can do is let's say
04:49 - uh We've stored uh you know we're
04:51 - storing users we can do this on the fly
04:54 - but what we can do now is we can select
04:56 - different values so I can execute
04:59 - something called a query which will
05:02 - select a specific amount of data from a
05:04 - specific row now usually you'd have an
05:07 - ID field um on the start of a row um and
05:13 - this this is this will be uh created
05:15 - something called autoincrement so you
05:17 - know what incrementation is it just
05:19 - increments every time so for each record
05:22 - created it's
05:23 - automatically um increments and this uh
05:26 - adds to the unique property of it and we
05:28 - can define a PR primary key for this ID
05:32 - and the primary key is just the unique
05:33 - field uh or the new unique column name
05:36 - in your database
