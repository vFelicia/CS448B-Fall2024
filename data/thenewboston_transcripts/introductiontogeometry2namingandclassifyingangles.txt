00:00 - ok today we're going to start off with
00:03 - naming angles and it probably seems
00:07 - really simple but there is an actual way
00:10 - you must name your angles so there are
00:13 - three ways you can name your angle you
00:16 - can start with point a and go
00:19 - counterclockwise to point C and to
00:23 - indicate it's an angle we do a little
00:25 - angle symbol out front and we say angle
00:28 - a B C we can go the other way and say
00:35 - it's angles C B a or we could just name
00:39 - it
00:40 - angle B now this this point right here
00:43 - is the vertex of your angle and the
00:49 - vertex is how we really define which
00:52 - angle that's why it has to be in the
00:54 - middle or if you just name it
00:57 - angle B you can you just have that
01:01 - vertex angle because that make sure that
01:05 - it's this angle that you're talking
01:07 - about okay now that we know how to name
01:11 - angles we're going to talk about the
01:13 - types of angles you can have so an angle
01:18 - whose measure is greater than 1 greater
01:23 - than 0 degrees but less than 90 degrees
01:26 - is an acute angle and you can remember
01:33 - it because it's a cute little angle
01:40 - because it's you know it's small okay an
01:45 - angle whose measurement is equal to 90
01:49 - degrees is called a right angle and it's
01:55 - right angles that make up squares and
01:58 - rectangles that's why when we measure it
02:00 - we do this little
02:06 - square right here to indicate that it's
02:09 - a right angle so an angle whose greater
02:14 - than 90 90 degrees but less than 180
02:19 - degrees is called an obtuse angle and an
02:26 - angle whose measure is equal to 100
02:30 - degrees is called a straight angle or as
02:36 - you can see it's also called a line
02:40 - because a line measure is equal to 180
02:47 - degrees and we more commonly refer to it
02:50 - as a line than an angle so let's do some
02:55 - examples with classifying angles so this
03:00 - first angle we have right here is
03:02 - measure is 73 degrees and since 73 is
03:09 - less than 90 degrees but greater since
03:20 - 73 degrees is less than 90 degrees but
03:23 - greater than 100 degrees this is an
03:26 - acute angle this one right here is 120
03:35 - degrees which is less than 180 degrees
03:39 - but greater than 90 degrees so this is
03:41 - an obtuse angle and like the first one
03:48 - this is greater than zero degrees but
03:54 - less than 90 degrees so this is also an
03:58 - acute angle okay so now that we know how
04:03 - to classify and named angles be sure to
04:07 - come back and watch the next video where
04:09 - we're going to talk about the congruence
04:12 - and addition properties of angles
