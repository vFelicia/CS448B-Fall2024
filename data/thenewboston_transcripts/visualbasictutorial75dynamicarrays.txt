00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - taking a look at dynamic arrays now
00:09 - arrays by default are limited to the
00:13 - number of items that you set when you
00:16 - declare it so let's say you declare an
00:18 - array and you have it hold 6 items so 0
00:21 - through 5 once you get to 5 you cannot
00:23 - add any more items in this tutorial
00:28 - we're going to be learning how to make
00:30 - an array bigger than it originally was
00:33 - by using the read in keyword so we'll go
00:36 - ahead and open up our toolbox we will
00:40 - add a list box and we will add a button
00:46 - we'll go ahead and close out of that so
00:49 - we'll come over here and we'll make each
00:51 - one of these a little bit bigger so
00:55 - we'll just set the text for button 1 to
01:00 - read in and we will set the name to
01:06 - button 3 dim and we'll set the list box
01:11 - to list array okay so go ahead and just
01:17 - make this a little bit smaller we'll go
01:19 - ahead and double click on read them to
01:20 - open up the event for it and what we're
01:23 - going to do is we're going to come up
01:25 - here and we are going to declare an
01:26 - array so private and we'll just do
01:30 - string sports and we'll set it to 2 so
01:36 - it'll hold three places as string now
01:39 - we'll go ahead and populate it so we
01:41 - will do baseball basketball and football
01:52 - and we aren't going to need this right
01:54 - here so let's go ahead and take that out
01:57 - okay so now we have an array that holds
02:00 - three items 0 1 & 2 so whenever they
02:03 - click read in we want to add those items
02:05 - to the list well first we'll add items
02:10 - to the list and then we'll read eclair
02:12 - it so for each item as string in string
02:19 - sports we want to go ahead and type list
02:25 - arrays listed items dot add item ok so
02:33 - go ahead and run this and you can see
02:37 - here that if we click this button we get
02:39 - those three in there so now what we're
02:41 - going to do is we are going to read
02:43 - eclair that so let's wait for this to
02:50 - load here okay so we'll add another list
02:55 - box so let's come over here to our tool
02:57 - box find list box
03:02 - okay so we'll shrink this down some to
03:04 - fit into our form and let's just make
03:08 - this a little wider
03:12 - and wilt it will set the name value of
03:15 - this to list new array so now we'll go
03:21 - ahead and come back here and we will
03:23 - find our button read them click event
03:25 - and now what we're going to do is we're
03:27 - going to read Eclair string sports so
03:30 - we'll type re dim and if you read the
03:34 - description says reallocate storage
03:36 - space for an array variable so it just
03:38 - pretty much starts over from scratch so
03:43 - we'll read in string sports and this
03:47 - time how many places we want to tap well
03:50 - right now I have two let's just do four
03:53 - syllable whole five and then we'll just
03:56 - go ahead and assign those to something
03:58 - so string string sports three it's going
04:02 - to be equal to wakeboarding and string
04:08 - sports four is going to be equal to
04:11 - let's just do soccer okay so now if we
04:18 - do another for loop so for each item as
04:22 - string in string sports we want to go
04:28 - ahead and type list new array dot items
04:33 - add and we're going to do we're going to
04:37 - add brackets right here and then we'll
04:40 - add we'll add item and we will add more
04:47 - brackets now the reason we're doing this
04:49 - is so that so that you can see each of
04:51 - the items enclosed in brackets and since
04:54 - some of these items are going to be no
04:56 - we need to put other strings in here
04:59 - because it will start complaining and it
05:00 - tries to print out something no and your
05:02 - program will crash so we'll just go
05:04 - ahead and add these let's go ahead and
05:07 - do it up here too so you can see so you
05:09 - can easily compare them
05:13 - and we will add them to the other side
05:21 - okay so now if we go ahead and run this
05:23 - you can see that here's our read in
05:26 - button if we go ahead and click that we
05:29 - get baseball basketball and football and
05:31 - then over here we have empty empty empty
05:34 - wakeboarding and soccer now when you
05:38 - read Eclair an array it's going to clear
05:40 - that array and set everything back to
05:42 - nothing and it's going to make it bigger
05:46 - or smaller whatever you want now there
05:50 - is an easy way to fix this and we will
05:52 - learn about that in the next tutorial so
05:54 - thanks for watching guys - stay tuned
05:55 - for the next tutorial
