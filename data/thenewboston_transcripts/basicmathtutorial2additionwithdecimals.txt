00:01 - welcome to addition with decimals
00:03 - decimals have fractions of a whole
00:05 - number so this is 75 and six t you can
00:09 - see here how we had the ones place the
00:11 - 10's place and so on and so forth well
00:13 - now we have the tth
00:17 - spell
00:19 - tths with the th don't get that confused
00:23 - with
00:25 - tens and we have the hundreds place
00:28 - spell
00:35 - hundreds versus the
00:42 - hundreds just know the difference
00:43 - between the two so we do the same exact
00:46 - thing as we do with the whole numbers we
00:48 - start on the very last n and even though
00:51 - there's not a zero here just pretend
00:52 - that there's a zero so 0 and 8 is
00:56 - 8 6 and 0 is six bring down the decimal
01:00 - point the decimal point is very
01:02 - important that you bring it down exactly
01:03 - where it is 5 and 5 is 10 put the zero
01:07 - there as a placeholder carry over the 1
01:10 - 78
01:13 - 9 and there's our
01:15 - product so over here we do the same
01:17 - exact thing 4 and 2 is six bring down
01:21 - the decimal point 8 and 2 is
01:25 - 10 placement holder carry over the one 9
01:29 - and 1 is 10 + 6 is 16 carry of the one
01:32 - bring down the six and 1 and 1 is two
01:36 - it's a different
01:38 - color and over here don't let this
01:40 - confuse you just put an imaginary
01:42 - decimal point right there and imaginary
01:44 - zero as a
01:45 - placeholder we have 0o and one is one
01:48 - bring down the decimal point we have two
01:51 - and 1 is three four and four is 8 6 and
01:55 - 5 is 11 put the one over there bring
01:58 - down the one right there and
02:02 - 10 same deal over here don't let this
02:05 - confuse you put an imaginary little
02:06 - decimal point right there and two zeros
02:10 - in actuality there can be infinite
02:11 - amount of zeros so you can keep on going
02:13 - from so on and so on so 0 and 9 is n 0
02:19 - and two is two bring down the decimal
02:22 - point 0 and five is 5 7 and 3 is
02:28 - 10 and this example 2 and six is
02:32 - 8 0 and two is two bring down the
02:36 - decimal point 6 and 7 is 13 carry over
02:39 - the one 9 and 1 is 10 + 8 is 18 carry
02:43 - over the one bring down the eight 4 and
02:46 - 2 is 6 + 1 is 7 and bring down the
02:53 - one over here if you get good at
02:55 - placement holders you just know that
02:57 - there's two placements behind the
02:59 - decimal points so you start with a seven
03:01 - and go two over it's 9 7 and 9 is 16 you
03:05 - want to start way over here way to the
03:07 - right carry over the one you can put it
03:09 - wherever you want on top of there or on
03:10 - top of there 9 and 1 is 10 + 6 is
03:14 - 16 car of the
03:16 - one and you have to make
03:19 - sure it's two
03:22 - sixes make sure you put the decimal
03:25 - point 6 and 2 is 8 + 1 is 9
03:30 - make sure you have enough room
03:33 - there 8 and 8 is
03:39 - 16 bring over the one and one and one is
03:42 - two so that's 260
03:50 - 26966 so over here we have two decimal
03:53 - points so pretend that there's an
03:55 - imaginary zero right there let's change
03:58 - colors so five and zero is
04:02 - five eight and zero is eight decimal
04:07 - point 6 and three is 10
04:13 - nine and 2 and 1 is
04:20 - three all right over here we have two
04:22 - decimal places over so 7 and 9 is 16
04:26 - carry the one 8 and 1 is 9
04:31 - 8 and 3 is
04:34 - 10 11 I'm
04:37 - sorry s
04:49 - that care over the one we have 7 and 3
04:53 - is 10 + 1 is 11 and then 4 and 1 is 5 +
04:57 - 1 is 6
05:01 - and that's all we have for addition with
05:04 - decimals
