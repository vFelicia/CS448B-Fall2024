00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this video we are taking the example
00:08 - of scroll top and we're using this to
00:11 - allow us to disable a check box in this
00:15 - case I have a text area here with just
00:19 - some fake Latin terms and conditions in
00:22 - the I've sort of seen this effect listed
00:26 - on a few websites where you have to
00:29 - scroll to the bottom of a text area in
00:32 - order for a particular check box to be
00:35 - enabled to actually agree to these terms
00:37 - and conditions at the moment this check
00:39 - box is disabled and I'm clicking on it
00:42 - at the moment and I can't actually check
00:44 - it so essentially what I have to do is
00:47 - scroll all the way to the bottom for
00:49 - this check box to become enabled then I
00:52 - can say you know continue with
00:54 - registration or however this works in
00:57 - this case this is obviously just an
00:59 - example so what I'm going to do is go
01:01 - ahead and scroll all the way to the
01:03 - bottom and you'll see that when I do
01:04 - reach the bottom this check box now
01:06 - becomes available and I can go ahead and
01:08 - click on it now we're going to be using
01:11 - the scroll top function in jQuery to do
01:15 - this but we're going to need to you know
01:18 - make some additional calculations
01:19 - because it's not as easy as it appears
01:22 - because we've styled this particular a
01:25 - text area a certain height we can't just
01:28 - return the height a new scroll top to
01:32 - actually calculate this we're going to
01:33 - need to do some additional calculation
01:35 - so we'll go back to our text editor or
01:39 - go over to our text editor and start
01:40 - writing this out okay so we're over 12
01:43 - text editor we are in index dot PHP
01:45 - which just literally has this text area
01:48 - here
01:49 - with the text inside and then underneath
01:51 - we've got a check box with the ID of
01:54 - agree the textarea ID is terms so we can
01:57 - use these two both reference each one
01:59 - and yeah that's it really we've just got
02:02 - a check box we've also got an ext J's
02:05 - file it's just it is essentially an
02:08 - external javascript file we've also
02:10 - included style dot CSS to style this
02:13 - text
02:13 - area let's just take a look at Starks
02:16 - CSS all I've done is giving it height
02:18 - here and a width here so that just makes
02:22 - it look like you you saw when I showed
02:25 - you the example and obviously yeah like
02:27 - I said we have expects TDOT J s which is
02:30 - our external javascript file so inside
02:33 - our external javascript file
02:36 - we want to go ahead and initially
02:39 - disable the check the text the checkbox
02:41 - sorry first of all if we go over to our
02:44 - browser you can see that at the moment
02:46 - it's enabled by default and nothing's
02:49 - really happening here in terms of
02:51 - functionality so the first thing we want
02:53 - to go ahead and do is actually disable
02:55 - this I'm gonna do this after the
02:57 - document is ready so I'm going to use
02:58 - document dot ready and inside create the
03:01 - function of the code that I'm going to
03:03 - run once the dom is available so the
03:07 - first thing we want to do is set an
03:09 - attribute to this agree agree checkbox
03:13 - to disable it so what we do is we say
03:18 - reference this with hash and agree so
03:20 - we're using a ID selector and we just
03:23 - want to set an attribute of this and
03:25 - that attribute is disabled and the value
03:28 - of that is disabled so when we go return
03:32 - to our browser and refresh this check
03:34 - box has been automatically disabled and
03:36 - we can't do anything and obviously still
03:38 - we don't have any functionality here
03:40 - okay so now what we want to go ahead and
03:43 - do is create an event handler for when
03:46 - this text area has a scroll event ie
03:50 - when we pull the scrollbar down or back
03:53 - up again so when we do scroll we want to
03:56 - then you know make some calculations get
03:58 - some heights and everything and then
04:01 - obviously perform an if statement to
04:03 - remove the attribute disabled if it's at
04:07 - the correct height so let's go ahead and
04:10 - select terms which is our text area
04:14 - obviously over here our idea of terms
04:16 - and we want to go ahead and append the
04:19 - scroll event handler to this now inside
04:23 - here we create a another function
04:25 - and all the code inside of here will be
04:28 - that that is run when we actually
04:30 - perform a scroll so when we scroll up or
04:32 - down so let's go ahead and create some
04:36 - variables and set some values to this
04:38 - then then like I'll explain about a bit
04:41 - about how it works so the first one is
04:43 - the text area height and this is equal
04:47 - to the obviously our terms or we could
04:50 - just say this because we've already
04:53 - selected the terms here so this will be
04:56 - this and then afterwards array key 0 and
05:00 - then dot scroll
05:01 - height now let's go ahead and alert this
05:04 - to the user in fact no that's probably
05:06 - not a good idea let's go ahead and
05:08 - create a temporary div just down here
05:11 - just so we can get some information fed
05:13 - back to us so I'm just going to call
05:15 - this I did feedback so we want to say
05:19 - selecting feedback apply the text to
05:23 - this as text area underscore height so
05:28 - we'll be constantly feeding back this
05:29 - value so when we scroll down you can see
05:32 - that it is just literally given us a
05:33 - height which is 7 to 4 now this
05:36 - obviously doesn't match the value that
05:40 - we have in style dot CSS but this is the
05:43 - height of the entire inside so the
05:46 - scrollable area essentially but this it
05:50 - still is inaccurate because we need to
05:52 - go ahead and remove or minus the inner
05:56 - height and that essentially means that
05:59 - it will match up to the correct value
