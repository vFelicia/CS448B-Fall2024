00:00 - ok so now we're going to create a event
00:03 - handler on the end of this and this is
00:05 - focus so we go ahead and create a
00:08 - function inside of here and then we pull
00:11 - that down so this essentially means that
00:14 - we are selecting these input fields
00:16 - adding this attribute and then once this
00:19 - field here or the input type with email
00:23 - is selected or is in focus we want to do
00:27 - something so again this is only applying
00:30 - to all email fields so whenever an email
00:32 - field is in focus we want to do this so
00:36 - let's go ahead and write out what we
00:38 - want this to do the first thing we want
00:40 - to do is we want to check if the value
00:42 - is equal to the email default value and
00:45 - if so get rid of the contents of it for
00:48 - example if we were to go ahead and type
00:50 - let's just we were to go ahead and click
00:53 - this we want to actually get rid of all
00:56 - the contents unless there is any other
00:59 - content other than this original message
01:02 - in there so let's go ahead and do that
01:04 - now I'm going to create an if statement
01:05 - and the condition is again another
01:09 - selector is selecting this which only
01:11 - applies to the current email field so
01:13 - for example if you had two different
01:15 - email fields on the page this would only
01:17 - select the current one that's in focus
01:19 - so we want to say this if this dot Val
01:21 - is equal to email default so if it
01:26 - equals the original text as we click in
01:29 - ie enter your email address then we want
01:31 - to wipe it we want to wipe the contents
01:33 - so what we do is we say this dot
01:36 - attribute and again we choose the value
01:38 - attribute but this time you set this to
01:40 - nothing so now what's going to happen is
01:43 - when we click it it disappears but it
01:46 - only disappears if it's the original
01:48 - content for example if I was to go ahead
01:50 - and down type in Alex at PHP academy'
01:53 - org and navigate away and click back in
01:56 - it doesn't remove it if we hadn't of
01:59 - included this functionality here let's
02:01 - just go and get rid of that
02:03 - go and get rid of
02:06 - this here and get rid of this here
02:11 - what's going to happen is now when we
02:13 - click in yes it disappears but when we
02:16 - go ahead and type in a email address and
02:18 - navigate away then navigate back in it
02:20 - re wipes it in the field so we use this
02:23 - if statement to determine the count
02:25 - value matching the default value and
02:28 - therefore that's the only time we need
02:29 - to actually wipe it I'm going to go
02:32 - ahead and just down here append on
02:34 - another event handler and this is blur
02:36 - ie when the user moves away from the
02:39 - field so when a blur are cut occurs we
02:44 - want to handle or call back another
02:46 - function and this time we want to check
02:48 - it for nothing now the only time we want
02:51 - to re put this text back into the field
02:54 - you'll notice that at the moment when we
02:56 - click in click out we don't get this
02:58 - original value back in so we need it's
03:01 - been left as blank but what we want to
03:03 - happen is if we say type something in
03:05 - then delete it and then navigate back
03:07 - away from it we want the default text to
03:10 - be placed back in so again we need
03:12 - another if statement and obviously our
03:15 - block there now the condition this time
03:17 - is the same as the other one this dot
03:20 - vowel but this time is if it's equal to
03:23 - zero it's equal to nothing then we want
03:25 - to carry out an action so when we
03:27 - navigate away from this field by the
03:29 - clicking away or tabbing away from a
03:32 - field to another field or another
03:34 - element on the page we check if this
03:36 - value is equal to nothing and if the
03:39 - value is equal to nothing we want to go
03:41 - ahead and set the attribute value to
03:43 - back to the email default so again this
03:46 - dot attribute much like we did here but
03:50 - this time instead of removing it we want
03:52 - to put it back to the original value so
03:54 - value and this is email default so again
04:00 - if it's empty we're just changing the
04:02 - value of this to the you know default so
04:05 - let's refresh and let's click in and
04:07 - click away again you automatically
04:09 - notice that what we've done has taken it
04:12 - been taken into effect we click in and
04:14 - we click away now when I click in and
04:16 - type something
04:18 - and navigate away nothing happens
04:21 - because it's not eat the value of this
04:22 - is not equal to nothing when I click
04:25 - back in you'll notice that the nothing
04:27 - disappears because we've already checked
04:29 - this up here if the value is is the
04:32 - email default value then blank the field
04:35 - is not the default value so it doesn't
04:37 - blank and therefore we keep this email
04:40 - address in here so that's the input type
04:44 - selector you'll notice that if I was to
04:46 - go ahead and duplicate this email field
04:49 - so if I was to go ahead and duplicate
04:53 - this again so for example confirm email
04:57 - and we'll just change the well the type
05:00 - still email what's going to happen is is
05:02 - we have the same functionality for both
05:04 - fields now we have the same
05:06 - functionality for this one as we do for
05:07 - this one so we can go ahead and type in
05:09 - Alex PHP academy' de org navigate away
05:12 - nothing happens we can come in here
05:14 - again another gate away or we can go
05:17 - Alex PHP academy' org navigate away and
05:21 - we've got two email addresses with the
05:24 - message original message obviously
05:25 - disappeared and we're just left with
05:27 - these so using our L attribute selector
05:32 - like I said at the start of the tutorial
05:34 - we can use this for absolutely any
05:36 - element that supports this but for now
05:39 - I've just decided to create something
05:41 - that was a bit more applicable to real
05:43 - life as opposed to just talking about
05:45 - you know different elements we can
05:47 - select and I think this is a really good
05:49 - example of how to do this and also
05:51 - notice that we've used absolutely no
05:53 - code javascript code in
05:57 - main file we've used jQuery to handle
06:00 - all of this so we've eliminated the need
06:02 - for any JavaScript to be mixed in
06:05 - without HTML and like I said this is
06:08 - cross-compatible now so wherever you
06:10 - include selectors jeaious and jquery is
06:13 - this functionality will be available
