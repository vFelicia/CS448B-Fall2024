00:00 - alrighty y'all now that we have our back
00:03 - end up running looking beautiful what we
00:06 - can do now is go ahead and figure out
00:07 - how to deploy our front end and the
00:10 - front end for this little sample social
00:12 - network site is on of course the New
00:15 - Boston developers and it is in this repo
00:18 - cooking front end
00:20 - so go ahead and check that out
00:23 - and when you do you're going to have
00:25 - this repo you're going to have to add
00:27 - this file right here so go ahead and
00:29 - create one new file
00:31 - and name it dot EnV dot production right
00:34 - here and for this you're only going to
00:37 - have two environment variables that you
00:38 - need to set and that is the API URL in
00:42 - websocket url and make sure that
00:45 - whenever you are setting um environment
00:47 - variables that they're prepended by
00:49 - react underscore app underscore and
00:52 - that's create react apps kind of uh
00:54 - required naming convention for setting
00:57 - environment variables but once you do
00:59 - that go ahead and just replace your
01:02 - domain names with whatever
01:05 - actually let me see if I can pull it up
01:07 - so basically uh whatever is right here
01:11 - and then once you have that done
01:14 - then you can just run npm run build and
01:18 - what this is going to do this command is
01:21 - it's going to create a new build
01:22 - directory actually let me go ahead and
01:24 - run this while I'm talking so this is
01:26 - going to go ahead and build your project
01:29 - matching pretty much set up to uh
01:31 - communicate with this back end and it's
01:33 - going to take all the files and stick it
01:35 - in this new build directory right here
01:37 - you see it just got created
01:39 - now before we actually deploy this what
01:43 - I would recommend doing is first
01:44 - installing this this serve library and
01:49 - it just allows you to test things
01:50 - locally before you you know
01:52 - get done like deploying everything to S3
01:54 - and something that isn't working then
01:56 - having to figure out you know what's
01:58 - broken
01:59 - so what we can do is once that's
02:01 - installed I already have installed so
02:03 - that's why I'm not going to do it but
02:04 - you can run the command serve hyphen s
02:07 - build and that's pretty much gonna serve
02:10 - this directory like we are going to on
02:13 - S3
02:14 - so now let me just go ahead and
02:17 - pop it open in localhost
02:21 - and check it out so it looks like it is
02:25 - indeed working and what I can actually
02:28 - do is maybe I can shrink this a little
02:30 - bit so you guys can see better but
02:33 - actually I'm gonna log out since I
02:35 - already had something in my cache from
02:37 - last time but I can either create new
02:40 - account or log in let me actually create
02:42 - a new account
02:43 - and
02:45 - you can see the new account that I
02:47 - created starts with the E7 97 now on my
02:51 - back end once I go to accounts it should
02:54 - be displayed there all right so E7 97
02:57 - and if I just click into that what I'm
03:00 - going to do is I'm just going to add
03:01 - some coins to my account just because I
03:03 - need coins to like test some things add
03:05 - comments add posts so on and so forth
03:07 - but for this actually
03:10 - this is another unique thing about how
03:12 - this is set up but it doesn't have a
03:14 - password yet it actually doesn't even
03:16 - need a password at all however in Django
03:18 - admin if you try to update your account
03:20 - model without a password then it kind of
03:22 - freaks out so for this you can just set
03:26 - anything for a password again it's just
03:28 - like it just needs something in there
03:30 - and for the panel it's let me just
03:33 - at 10 000 and I'll just have saving
03:36 - continue editing
03:37 - now in your react app this should update
03:40 - automatically you shouldn't need to hit
03:41 - refresh because everything's already
03:44 - hooked up with websockets and yeah as
03:47 - soon as you update your account balance
03:48 - on here it should always automatically
03:51 - Refresh on the front end and now let me
03:53 - just go ahead and create a recipe so
03:55 - I'll say actually let me see what I got
03:59 - actually this is one of the most
04:00 - delicious things that I cooked it's well
04:04 - I gotta admit something so I cook the
04:06 - chicken and yes it was delicious this
04:08 - pasta however even though it was
04:10 - delicious it was microwavable bag but it
04:13 - was cauliflower pasta made out of
04:15 - cauliflower so you know not that bad
04:18 - after all all right so let me see
04:20 - chicken and cauliflower pasta and I'll
04:22 - say nice and juicy there you go
04:24 - obviously I wrote These before now let
04:27 - me go ahead and submit this and
04:29 - hopefully if everything worked all right
04:32 - beautiful now let me just go ahead and
04:34 - copy this image address just to make
04:37 - sure
04:37 - yes indeed it is now in our penguin
04:41 - chess backend S3 bucket looking good I
04:44 - mean look how juicy that is oh baby baby
04:47 - okay anyway skin a little bit distracted
04:50 - here
04:51 - point is that we are just testing that
04:56 - everything works locally and now once we
04:59 - confirm that we can go ahead and what
05:02 - we're going to end up doing is taking
05:04 - this build directory and instead of
05:06 - serving it locally since you know we
05:08 - actually want users to be able to access
05:10 - it we're pretty much going to be taking
05:12 - everything in here and moving it in an
05:14 - S3 bucket and I'll show you how to serve
05:17 - your entire website from just that S3
05:19 - bucket
05:21 - so sounds pretty cool in order to do
05:24 - that the first thing we're going to need
05:25 - to do is create an S3 bucket
05:28 - now remember our back end was
05:31 - penguinchess.net now for the front end I
05:34 - want to serve that from my S3 bucket and
05:37 - ultimately from the domain name
05:39 - penguinchess.io
05:41 - so just keep that in mind when we're
05:44 - creating this uh just those differences
05:47 - but I'm going to create a bucket and the
05:49 - bucket name I'm just going to name it
05:50 - penguinchess.io
05:52 - and now the region this is good hit
05:56 - crate bucket
05:59 - and now from here
06:03 - oh just go whoa whoa whoa let's get back
06:06 - in there
06:08 - all right where is my bucket so it was
06:12 - penguin chess dot IO
06:15 - and from here what we need to do is we
06:17 - need to just um kind of enable hosting
06:19 - so I'm going to hit properties
06:21 - and in static website hosting
06:27 - where are you might be out the way okay
06:30 - so in static website hosting all the way
06:32 - at the bottom go ahead and hit edit here
06:35 - and then I'm just going to enable static
06:38 - website hosting
06:39 - and now in the index document right here
06:43 - just type in the index document so
06:46 - index.html
06:48 - typically yours is going to be a
06:50 - index.html but just to uh show you
06:52 - what's going on with the react app
06:54 - so this uh this pretty much gets built
06:57 - along with the source code into this
06:59 - build file and this is kind of my entry
07:01 - point this index.html so this is what
07:04 - they're going to load in in the react
07:06 - app loads this one tag pretty much gets
07:11 - replaced so the the entire react app so
07:14 - that's pretty cool but anyways that's
07:15 - what's going on that's why it's named
07:17 - index.html
07:19 - and let's see in the error document
07:24 - this is another interesting thing and
07:26 - I'll talk to you about this in uh just a
07:28 - bit but in the error document we're also
07:31 - going to be serving index.html
07:34 - and this well I'll talk to you in uh
07:37 - later on when we set up the CDN but I'll
07:39 - tell you why we do that in just a bit so
07:41 - for now let's just go ahead and hit save
07:44 - and all right so this is now uh pretty
07:47 - much enabled to uh host a website
07:50 - so from here what we can do
07:53 - is
07:56 - show you where there it is upload button
07:59 - right there so now what we are going to
08:02 - do is pretty much take all the files in
08:04 - here
08:05 - all these files including this static
08:07 - folder right here and yeah kind of just
08:10 - upload them actually can I do it right
08:11 - from here
08:17 - trying to drop my butt okay add file is
08:20 - going to do this the hard way the hard
08:22 - way just gonna click like two times okay
08:26 - projects where are you at this is
08:28 - cooking front end build and I'm going to
08:31 - select all these files
08:33 - upload those and I also want to add a
08:35 - folder which is my static folder
08:37 - contains all my like images CSS so on
08:40 - and so forth
08:41 - upload those as well then once I have
08:43 - everything selected just going to go
08:45 - down here and click upload
08:48 - all right and now I can close out of
08:50 - this and in my permissions what I want
08:55 - to do is in my block public access
08:58 - settings I'm going to hit edit and then
09:01 - I'm going to uncheck this and then I'm
09:04 - going to save those changes and then you
09:06 - just need to
09:07 - write confirm right here
09:10 - and then after this one more thing that
09:13 - we need to do is yeah right here so in
09:17 - your bucket policy
09:19 - um we pretty much just need to well
09:22 - pretty much similar to what we did with
09:24 - the other S3 bucket for on our back end
09:27 - allowing people to read images from the
09:29 - bucket we just need to uh kind of edit
09:31 - the permissions for these
09:33 - so go in here and just paste in this
09:36 - again I'm going to have this guide in
09:38 - the description below however just a
09:41 - note make sure you replace this with
09:44 - whatever your bucket name is so we're
09:46 - pretty much saying that any anyone from
09:50 - the public anyone at all is allowed to
09:52 - read the items in this bucket
09:56 - and now that that's taken care of we can
09:59 - just hit save changes
10:01 - and yeah good to go so from here we have
10:06 - our bucket set up people can read from
10:07 - it however we just don't want to kind of
10:11 - uh
10:13 - quit here what we want to do is we now
10:16 - want to set up our cloudfront
10:17 - distribution
10:19 - so what this is going to do is it's
10:21 - going to allow these files to be served
10:23 - closer to the user even though they're
10:25 - in this bucket they aren't going to have
10:27 - to reach all the way out to Virginia to
10:29 - pull them so how do we do that
10:32 - well if we get out of here
10:35 - okay how do I get out of S3
10:42 - over here just have to refresh sometimes
10:44 - and then the toolbar pops up but anyways
10:47 - if I go to looking for cloudfront right
10:51 - here which is your CDN content delivery
10:53 - Network and we're going to create a new
10:56 - distribution
10:58 - and for the origin domain what we can do
11:02 - is we can choose
11:06 - did I miss it
11:09 - right here this uh S3 bucket
11:12 - penguinetress.io and this is pretty much
11:14 - that uh S3 bucket that we just created
11:17 - and we're gonna have this warning uh has
11:20 - enabled if you plan to use this
11:22 - distributed website which we recommend
11:23 - using the S3 website yada yada you can
11:26 - read it yes use website endpoint now
11:29 - down in the where are you at all right
11:32 - so in this viewer protocol policy we
11:36 - want to redirect all HTTP requests to
11:38 - https make sure to compress objects
11:41 - automatically that's going to be yes as
11:43 - well and then for the
11:47 - for default root object
11:52 - default root object this is going to be
11:55 - set to
11:56 - index.html and one other thing web
11:59 - application
12:04 - all right so for web application
12:07 - firewall we want to hit do not enable
12:10 - security protections and I believe let
12:14 - me just check
12:15 - yeah I believe that's it so we can now
12:18 - hit to create distribution
12:21 - and yes successfully created a new
12:24 - distribution and our distribution domain
12:27 - name is this so this is kind of like our
12:30 - temporary domain name
12:32 - so with this we can actually go there
12:34 - however it's not going to work right now
12:36 - because it is still deploying
12:38 - however it shouldn't take too long
12:42 - but uh either way once this is done
12:46 - deploying I'll pause my video right now
12:47 - once this is done to point we can just
12:50 - pretty much just go here and uh if
12:52 - everything worked correctly our front
12:54 - end should be hosted right here all
12:56 - right and check it out it is now
12:59 - distributed and boom look at this a nice
13:02 - beautiful front end of course our domain
13:05 - name is in a configured yet but I mean
13:08 - hey this is pretty memorable I think
13:11 - hey have you guys checked out that site
13:13 - d1nxfrd
13:15 - vef cx060 oh yeah man I love that site
13:19 - it's oh so cool
13:21 - all right
13:22 - now uh here let me just log out and uh
13:25 - just test around make sure okay create a
13:28 - new account 792b
13:31 - let me add some coins to that account
13:33 - 792b again for uh this setup you just
13:37 - need a temporary password
13:41 - nice
13:43 - a thousand coins added to my account and
13:45 - of course it should work but let me just
13:48 - for a good measure what else oh this was
13:50 - another fan just fantastic dish I made
13:53 - again Chef Bucky coming through again
13:55 - what one was this this was uh
13:59 - no this was uh
14:02 - chicken right here creamy garlic
14:05 - mushroom chicken pasta
14:07 - delightful and I'll just say uh sweet
14:10 - right there submit it
14:12 - all right recipe created now I do
14:16 - actually want to point out this you see
14:17 - how this image is uh kind of taking a
14:19 - long time to load so a couple issues
14:24 - um well not really issues but things
14:25 - that we can improve in the future
14:27 - so you usually just don't want to serve
14:30 - the full size image like all the time
14:33 - since for example look on this profile
14:36 - well one you notice that these images
14:38 - are taken a long time to load again so
14:41 - there are a couple issues right here
14:43 - um one thing is we don't need to load in
14:46 - the full size image when we're only
14:48 - displaying a smaller portion of it so
14:51 - what we can do in the future is set up a
14:52 - micro service to like
14:54 - um resize these images so they're
14:57 - serving like just the size that you need
14:59 - on the front end and another thing
15:01 - that's happening if I hit refresh right
15:03 - here you notice is that this image well
15:06 - maybe you can't notice but you you see
15:08 - how it kind of takes a long time that's
15:10 - because it's loading again and again and
15:12 - again so we can actually cache this on
15:14 - the front end to say hey you just
15:16 - downloaded this if the user makes
15:18 - another request for it you don't
15:19 - actually need to go out and fetch it
15:21 - each time so a lot of different
15:23 - optimizations that can be made you can
15:26 - see the image loading is pretty apparent
15:27 - on that one but I mean right now we have
15:32 - our own social network launched name not
15:35 - that memorable but I mean hey it's
15:38 - working I can invite my friends and uh
15:40 - yeah we're gonna have a good time so in
15:44 - the future actually in the next video
15:46 - what we'll do is we'll connect the
15:49 - domain name so we can use that instead
15:52 - of this honk and Tonkin URL and also
15:55 - from there we're going to optimize the
15:57 - deployment process since right now we
16:00 - saw how manual everything was
16:02 - not only building the front end where
16:06 - you have to run all those commands
16:07 - manually and then I had to like upload
16:09 - them to S3 like who has time for that
16:11 - I'm gonna carpal tunnel if I have to do
16:13 - that all the time but also the back end
16:15 - where instead of you know having an ssh
16:18 - in and pull the latest updates and run a
16:21 - bunch of commands to do this and that we
16:24 - can move this all to a CI CD pipeline
16:27 - automate everything and then uh yeah
16:30 - lots of optimizations we probably want
16:32 - to restructure our layout on the back
16:34 - end so we have multiple ec2 instances
16:37 - talking to a single RDS database but
16:40 - anyways enough of that I'm actually
16:42 - going to go out and grab a quesadilla
16:44 - right now all this food is making me
16:46 - hungry
16:46 - if anyone actually makes it this far and
16:50 - they actually spun up a social and how
16:52 - it work first of all that would be very
16:54 - impressive but second of all add my
16:57 - account I'll put my account number below
16:59 - and send me a link to it and then I'll
17:02 - go ahead
17:03 - you know what I'll do I'll go ahead and
17:05 - upload the picture of my quesadilla that
17:07 - I'm about to go buy so yeah I'm hungry
17:09 - I'm gonna go grab that and I will see
17:11 - you next video
