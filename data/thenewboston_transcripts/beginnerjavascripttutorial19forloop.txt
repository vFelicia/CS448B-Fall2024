00:00 - all right guys welcome to your 19th
00:02 - tutorial in JavaScript and in this
00:03 - lesson I'm going to be talking to you
00:05 - guys about something called Loops now a
00:08 - loop is extremely useful in JavaScript
00:11 - in pretty much every computer programm
00:13 - language because it basically saves time
00:16 - anytime you need to do something
00:18 - repetitive a loop comes in handy for
00:21 - example if you wanted to write like
00:25 - um
00:27 - document. write um
00:31 - let's write something stupid I
00:33 - love Rebecca Black and if you wanted to
00:36 - write this like 10 times on the screen
00:38 - then yes you could go ahead and copy
00:41 - this and paste paste paste paste paste
00:43 - paste paste but you know what that's
00:45 - going to get jumble look how messy it is
00:47 - already and you know it's just not a
00:49 - very efficient way of doing things so
00:51 - wouldn't it be cool if there is a way
00:53 - where we could take a line of code and
00:55 - write it once and just tell JavaScript
00:58 - do that 10 times or do that 20 times or
01:00 - do it a 100 times well it's going to
01:03 - save you a whole lot of typing so let me
01:05 - show you guys one way to do
01:07 - that one way to do that is called the
01:10 - for Loop and it's
01:12 - F in the syntax the basic body to set up
01:16 - this Loop is four and then you write two
01:19 - parentheses and in your curly braces or
01:21 - curly brackets what the heck is like the
01:25 - regular the professional educational
01:29 - name for these because I always say
01:31 - curly braces and I know they're not
01:33 - parentheses cuz these are parentheses so
01:35 - if someone knows let me know send me a
01:37 - message so anyways the Syntax for this
01:40 - is you have four and inside here you're
01:42 - going to tell it how many number of
01:44 - times to run and here you write what bit
01:47 - of code you want to run so
01:50 - document. write and then just go ahead
01:52 - and write um you know I love Rebecca
01:57 - Black and let's go ahead and add a break
01:59 - to
02:02 - that actually that needs to be in here
02:05 - break and this is just whenever we print
02:07 - it out it will move on the next line so
02:10 - you're saying all right simple enough
02:11 - but you don't go ahead and just write a
02:14 - number like 10 in there or else whenever
02:16 - you try to run it it's not going to work
02:18 - that would just be way too easy four
02:21 - syntax or excuse me the four Loop is set
02:23 - up in a very specific way it takes three
02:27 - different statements inside this little
02:29 - condition
02:30 - the first statement is you need to make
02:33 - a variable and you need to give it a
02:35 - starting point so you actually don't
02:37 - even need the name VAR like that you
02:40 - just need to go ahead and name it
02:41 - because it's going to be expecting a
02:42 - variable so go ahead and make a variable
02:44 - named X and set it equal to zero zero
02:47 - and one is basically always your
02:50 - starting point and now you need to give
02:53 - it an ending point so you don't just say
02:57 - something like x equal 60 you actually
02:59 - need to say x is less than 10 and the
03:03 - reasoning behind this is X is going to
03:05 - start at zero and it's going to keep
03:08 - printing this out until X reaches above
03:12 - 10 so every saying all right so is it
03:16 - automatically going to add one to it
03:18 - each time or add three to it each time
03:20 - or how do I know how much to increment X
03:22 - by each time well that is actually the
03:24 - last statement we're going to put the
03:26 - last statement is how much do you want
03:28 - that value to go up by
03:30 - so remember that x++ Plus+ was a special
03:34 - sign for add one to it each time so you
03:38 - can put something like x +al 3 and now
03:42 - if we go ahead and save this it's going
03:44 - to print it out four times and it
03:46 - printed this out four times because the
03:49 - first time it said x equals 0 so is 0
03:53 - less than 10 yes so print it out the
03:55 - next time is three six and nine so so 0
04:00 - 3 6 and 9 is four times where it's less
04:04 - than 10 the next time 12 is greater than
04:07 - 10 so that's why it doesn't run so
04:09 - that's what you can do but most people
04:11 - just always put
04:13 - x++ and this means start at zero go all
04:17 - the way until you get more than 10 so
04:19 - let's go ahead and save this and check
04:20 - it out it starts at zero it goes zero
04:25 - and I'm talking what the value of x is
04:27 - right now x equals zero one two three
04:32 - four five 6 78 nine and then the next
04:37 - one when X is equal to 10 it doesn't
04:39 - pren out and the reasoning behind this
04:41 - is is 10 less than 10 no 10 is equal to
04:45 - 10 so that's why it doesn't print out so
04:48 - that is how you can get JavaScript to
04:50 - print out a certain line or a certain
04:52 - bit of code a certain number of times
04:54 - you can either do this and you know you
04:57 - can start at five and you can go to you
05:00 - know 450 if you want by once check it
05:04 - out
05:05 - refresh oh yeah look that huge list of I
05:08 - love Rebecca plaques so
05:11 - anyways just keep this in mind if you
05:13 - ever like get in trouble in school and
05:16 - as your punishment you have to type out
05:18 - I love Rebecca Black which would be a
05:21 - very good punishment 150 times this is a
05:24 - nice little trick to save you from
05:26 - actually having to type it out so um
05:29 - that's all I have for you guys for this
05:30 - tutorial I hope you guys enjoyed and uh
05:33 - yeah I guess I'll see you in the next
05:35 - tutorial
