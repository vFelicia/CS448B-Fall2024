00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:02 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - finishing our day action program that we
00:09 - have been making now if you have no clue
00:12 - what what you're looking at right now
00:14 - you might want to move back a little bit
00:15 - to the enumerations tutorial and these
00:19 - last couple two doors built build on
00:21 - each other and we make a day action
00:24 - program now if you remember from the
00:27 - previous tutorial when we run the
00:29 - program
00:30 - everything compiles and it works and if
00:32 - we change the date it says as 1600
00:36 - richard is but it doesn't actually tell
00:38 - us what he's doing so what we're going
00:40 - to do is we're going to use this
00:41 - enumeration right here and we are going
00:45 - to use state because we haven't your
00:47 - state anywhere else in here so what
00:50 - we're going to do is we're going to set
00:52 - the value of state according to whatever
00:54 - the value is that is passed to the set
00:58 - function in property so we'll go ahead
01:02 - and just before we set the text of label
01:06 - state we're going to get the value of
01:09 - the value that is passed it's an integer
01:12 - we're going to get the value of that and
01:14 - set state up here according to the value
01:17 - so let's just go ahead and use an if
01:22 - statement so if value now let's come up
01:28 - here and see what we have for the first
01:30 - one so we have asleep so if value is
01:35 - let's say what are they going to be
01:37 - sleep let's say 10 o'clock to 6 o'clock
01:40 - so if value is greater than or equal to
01:43 - 20 and value is less than 6 then what
01:53 - we're going to do is we're going to set
01:54 - state equals and since state is of type
01:59 - day action we can set state equals day
02:03 - action dot and then we have our options
02:06 - right here we'll just go ahead and go
02:08 - with asleep now let's go ahead and come
02:11 - up here and look
02:12 - what else we have we have waking up so
02:14 - what hours would they be waking up so
02:17 - we'll go ahead and do an else--if right
02:19 - here so else if value is greater than or
02:26 - equal to 6 and value is less than 7 so
02:35 - if it's 6 to 7 then what do what do we
02:40 - want to do well we'll set state is equal
02:44 - to day action dot waking up and we'll
02:50 - just go ahead and do this for each one
02:52 - of the values so we can go ahead and
02:54 - type else if again and we can type if
02:57 - value and let's see what we have next we
03:00 - at school so let's just say that at
03:02 - school from 8 o'clock until 3 o'clock so
03:06 - if value is less than or equal to let's
03:13 - say greater than or equal to 8 and value
03:18 - is less than what's 3 o'clock in
03:20 - military time we got 12 13 14 15 let's
03:24 - do 15 so if it's greater than equal to 8
03:28 - and less than 15 then day action or
03:36 - state is going to be equal to day action
03:39 - dot school and we'll create another
03:43 - elsif here so else if value is let's see
03:49 - what they have lunch so let's just say
03:52 - they eat lunch at 11 to 12 so if it's
03:56 - greater than or equal to 11 and value is
04:01 - less than 12 then state equals day
04:08 - action dot lunch
04:12 - and we'll do this two more times so if
04:16 - value is greater than or equal to let's
04:24 - say they get home and they do let's just
04:26 - say this is when they're doing homework
04:27 - so when they get home so we'll go ahead
04:30 - if it's greater than or equal to 16 and
04:40 - value is less than let's say they work
04:44 - until 6 o'clock so let's do 18 then
04:50 - state is going to equal day action dot
04:54 - home and we'll do this one last time
04:58 - for the programming so let's just say
05:01 - they do this as a hobby or something so
05:06 - we'll go ahead if value is greater than
05:09 - or equal to 18 and value is less than 10
05:16 - o'clock so 20 then go ahead and state
05:20 - equals day action home now when I was
05:26 - making this el-sayf right here I did 16
05:29 - greater than or equal to 16 in less than
05:31 - 18 I just went ahead and gave them an
05:34 - hour for the bus ride but to make it
05:36 - simpler let's just do 15 right there so
05:38 - this one has to be less than 15 but this
05:40 - can this one can be equal to 15 so now
05:44 - we're going to use state to tell the
05:47 - user what Richard is doing so we're
05:50 - going to go ahead and type an end sign
05:53 - right here and then we can just do
05:57 - current or not current state dot to
06:03 - string so what this is going to do is
06:06 - it's going to take the value of state
06:08 - and convert it to a string so if the
06:12 - hour is image 1 6 & 7 then it's going to
06:15 - say Richard is waking up so let's go
06:21 - ahead and run this
06:23 - and we will bring it over here and you
06:27 - can see it says at 18 o'clock Richard is
06:30 - home so right now
06:32 - Richard would be home so we'll go ahead
06:33 - and we'll set this to two o'clock and it
06:38 - says at 14
06:40 - Richard is school or at school and let's
06:45 - change is something else I change this
06:47 - to 22 or here let's do 12 o'clock p.m.
06:55 - let's see um let's try something else
07:01 - let's set this to 12 a.m. and it looks
07:09 - like we have a problem with our code so
07:13 - if values greater than equal 20 and
07:15 - value is less than or equal to 6
07:18 - ok looks like we had a little bit of a
07:20 - problem with the sleeping due to the way
07:23 - that the time is set up so I just went
07:25 - ahead and took that out so let's go
07:27 - ahead and get rid of a sleep right here
07:30 - so we'll go ahead and run this and we
07:34 - can go ahead and set this to 6 a.m. and
07:37 - I said says s 6 Richard is waking up now
07:40 - let's send Richard to school so at 10:00
07:43 - Richard is at school and now let's get
07:46 - him working on his homework so at 16
07:51 - Richard is home now let's have Richard
07:53 - start programming so we'll set it to
07:55 - 8:00 p.m. and at 20 Richard is home
07:59 - let's set it to 10:00 p.m. okay looks
08:04 - like we have another area we need to
08:05 - come down here and find this and set it
08:09 - equal to programming okay
08:15 - so at 18 richard is programming so go
08:22 - ahead and if you have an engine in this
08:23 - code and already you can enter it in
08:25 - play around with you want sorry I have
08:27 - some errors in this program but I've had
08:29 - some people comment on my other channel
08:30 - saying that when I make errors it seems
08:33 - more realistic because it might be
08:35 - something that they run into so practice
08:39 - with this make some properties if you
08:44 - want to find you can challenge yourself
08:45 - to find a different way to do this
08:46 - because in programming there's a lot of
08:48 - different ways to do the same thing and
08:50 - as a programmer you need to find the
08:53 - most efficient way of doing it so you
08:55 - can make this program modify it do
08:57 - whatever you want then once you're done
08:58 - with that go ahead and move onto the
09:00 - next tutorial
