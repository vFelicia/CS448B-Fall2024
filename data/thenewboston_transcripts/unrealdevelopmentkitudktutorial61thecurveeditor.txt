00:00 - what's going on guys welcome to your
00:01 - 61st tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
00:04 - going to be going over the curve editor
00:06 - so go ahead and open up Matt and if you
00:09 - don't see the curve editor already you
00:10 - can do so in a couple ways if you go to
00:12 - window unreal curve editor or you can go
00:15 - ahead and hit this toggle curve editor
00:17 - button it's going to bring up your curve
00:19 - editor Now by default we need to tell
00:22 - the udk which track we want to graph so
00:26 - if we go ahead and select the track in
00:28 - the lower right hand corner we're going
00:29 - to see a Black Box go ahead and click
00:32 - that box and it's going to go ahead and
00:34 - graph those curves for that track now if
00:37 - your view is kind of messed up like that
00:40 - go ahead and just hit this button fit
00:41 - view to all and it's going to make your
00:43 - curves appear nicely in the screen so
00:46 - let me explain to you guys what the
00:47 - curve editor is your curve editor is
00:50 - basically graphing the movement of your
00:53 - curves like on a sheet of graph paper
00:56 - where left to right this axis along the
00:59 - bottom symbolizes is a time so this is 0
01:02 - seconds 1 second 50 2 and 1 half seconds
01:06 - right there and this up and down this 50
01:09 - 00 symbolizes the distance so the reason
01:13 - we're only getting one graph is because
01:16 - our model is only changing on one axis
01:20 - so let me go ahead and make this more
01:22 - appearent by on checking these if you go
01:26 - ahead and select this first one you can
01:28 - see that it's graphing the red or X
01:31 - movement of this door so this r g and B
01:36 - blocks B box excuse me graphs the X Y
01:41 - and Z movement of this model so if we go
01:44 - ahead and to take a look at the X
01:46 - movement which is the left to right
01:48 - movement of our door check it out
01:50 - whenever we play our animation this door
01:52 - is not moving left to right at all so
01:54 - that's why we get a key frame right here
01:56 - and a key frame right here no change
02:00 - whatsoever if we go ahead and take a
02:01 - look at the Y which is forward down the
02:04 - hallway and backward towards me our door
02:07 - is not moving in either of those
02:09 - directions so that's why we get zero
02:11 - change in y however if we take a look at
02:13 - Z which is up and down that's what
02:16 - direction our door is moving so as you
02:18 - can see it starts at location 0
02:21 - 0 and by the end of 3 seconds it's about
02:25 - at
02:26 - -240 at about a second and a half it's
02:29 - about
02:30 - 120 so as you can see we can visually
02:33 - graph the movement of our door so again
02:37 - one last time this r g and B in other
02:40 - words red green and blue value line up
02:43 - with this X Y and Z axes of your door so
02:48 - since we're only going to be working
02:50 - with a z or blue we can only go ahead
02:53 - and graph that so we don't accidentally
02:54 - grab any other key frames now let me
02:57 - talk to you guys about the different
02:58 - types of graphs
03:00 - this graph right here if you hover over
03:03 - it it's called Curve autoc clamped it's
03:05 - kind of like the default curve because
03:07 - it gives you a nice acceleration again I
03:09 - said that if something's graphed and it
03:12 - has no change then it's going to be
03:14 - graphed all on the same line if it's
03:16 - straight up and down then it means it's
03:18 - moving really fast so this door is going
03:20 - to start out kind of slow and then right
03:23 - about here it speeds up a lot and then
03:25 - by the end as you can see it kind of
03:27 - slows down so this is a natural looking
03:30 - crap because whenever you're driving a
03:32 - car or something you don't go from zero
03:34 - to 60 in zero seconds you kind of need
03:37 - to speed up there get up to speed and
03:39 - then when you you know are kind of
03:41 - accelerating fast and you need to slow
03:43 - down you slow down gradually you just
03:45 - don't hit a brick wall so this is kind
03:47 - of a natural acceleration if you do want
03:50 - a constant speed throughout you can go
03:52 - ahead and select one of these key frames
03:54 - and hit linear graph and now your
03:56 - graph's going to be linear a constant
03:59 - speed again I really don't like to use
04:01 - this in you know maybe in some rare
04:04 - cases but you typically want to use this
04:06 - curve autoc clamped now you can also see
04:09 - right next to your key frames you have
04:11 - this little white box right here if you
04:14 - go ahead and grab this you can manually
04:16 - adjust your curve as well so now what
04:19 - this is doing is I made something called
04:22 - an overshoot since this graph or the
04:26 - basic movement of my door is going from0
04:29 - to 300 so whenever I bring that curve
04:32 - above that check out what happens it
04:34 - kind of starts out at zero and then it
04:36 - kind of loads up changes in the positive
04:40 - distance so it kind of goes up before
04:43 - coming back down so that's called
04:45 - overshooting um maybe if you want to you
04:48 - know make a gun load up or someone
04:50 - punching and they you know pull their
04:52 - fist back then this is a good way to do
04:54 - that but typically you want to work with
04:56 - either curve autoc clamped or just Auto
05:00 - or maybe you know linear um this
05:03 - constant has straight left and right or
05:05 - straight up and down um again it's all
05:07 - depends on what you're looking for so
05:10 - that's basically the different types of
05:12 - Curves and also if you drag these little
05:14 - white things and by the way these white
05:16 - things right here these white boxes are
05:18 - called bezier handles so if you ever
05:21 - hear me talking about beer handles like
05:23 - grab your beer handle that's what I'm
05:25 - talking about this little white box
05:26 - right here it means manually adjusting
05:28 - your curve so that's basically all there
05:30 - is to teach on the uh curve editor I
05:33 - don't think I'm missing anything so well
05:36 - if I am I guess I'll talk to you guys
05:37 - about it in the upcoming tutorial but
05:39 - for now you guys now have need okay how
05:43 - can I say this you guys now know how to
05:46 - use the curve editor so congratulations
05:49 - so uh for now thank you guys for
05:50 - watching don't forget to subscribe and
05:51 - I'll see you guys in next video
