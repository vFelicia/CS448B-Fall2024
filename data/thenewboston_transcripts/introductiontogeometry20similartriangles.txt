00:00 - so when we say we have similar
00:03 - triangles it means that their
00:07 - corresponding angles are congruent and
00:09 - their corresponding sides are
00:12 - proportional so if triangle ABC is
00:17 - similar to Triangle D
00:19 - EF angle a is congruent to angle
00:24 - D angle B is congruent to angle
00:28 - e angle C is congruent to angle
00:34 - F and their sides are proportional so a
00:39 - over
00:40 - D is equal to B over e is equal to C
00:45 - over s
00:51 - f so we know that triangle AB C is
00:56 - similar to Triangle
00:58 - DF if we we know that side a =
01:05 - 5 C = 9 and
01:09 - F equal 18 we want to find out what side
01:14 - D equals so since they're similar that
01:17 - means that their sides are proportional
01:22 - so
01:23 - a which is right here
01:26 - five over D which is what we're trying
01:29 - to find out
01:30 - out is equal to
01:35 - C over F because they're similar in
01:40 - proportional triangles so just like we
01:43 - would solve a normal
01:46 - proportion we're going to cross
01:53 - multiply and we're going to
01:58 - get 9
02:01 - B is equal to 5 *
02:05 - 18 so 9 D =
02:10 - 90 divide both sides by 9 you get D =
02:15 - 10 so if e is equal to 24 find B so e is
02:21 - equal to 24 and we want to find side
02:27 - B so
02:30 - B over
02:32 - 24 is equal to we're going to set it
02:36 - equal to 9 over
02:40 - 18 so then we're going to cross
02:47 - multiply we get 18 B is
02:51 - equal
02:52 - 9 *
02:55 - 24 18 B =
03:04 - 26 divide both sides by
03:07 - 18 and we get b equal
03:14 - 12 okay so the thing to remember when
03:18 - we're setting up these proportions to
03:20 - find the lengths of these sides we want
03:23 - to keep the proportions consistent so in
03:26 - the first one I started with five which
03:30 - is this
03:33 - side of this big
03:35 - triangle so I'm going to put that over
03:38 - this
03:39 - side of the Little
03:42 - Triangle and I'm going to go back to the
03:45 - big triangle and put this side over this
03:50 - side of the Little
03:52 - Triangle now we could do the opposite
03:55 - and have the little
03:57 - triangle over the big
04:02 - triangle it doesn't matter as long as we
04:05 - keep it
04:07 - consistent so we still have these two
04:11 - triangles but now we
04:14 - know that the
04:16 - measure of angle a is
04:21 - 35 the measure of angle C is
04:25 - 65 and we have to find the measure of
04:28 - all the other angles
04:30 - so the first thing we're going to
04:32 - do is we're going to find the measure of
04:34 - angle B and we can do that using our
04:37 - rules of the interior angles of
04:41 - triangles so 35 +
04:45 - 65 + x is equal to 180 because all the
04:49 - angles in a triangle always add up to
04:53 - 180 so 35 + 65 is equal to
04:58 - 100 + x is equal to
05:02 - 180 so X is equal if we subtract 100
05:07 - over X is equal to 80 so that means B is
05:11 - equal to
05:13 - 80 so now in order to find out the
05:16 - angles of the Little Triangle we need to
05:19 - remember what similar triangles have in
05:23 - common since we know that these two
05:25 - triangles are
05:27 - similar that means that they're
05:29 - corresponding angles are congruent so
05:33 - the measure of angle D has to equal the
05:36 - measure of angle a since angle a is
05:41 - 35 measure of angle D is also
05:46 - 35 same thing goes for the measure of
05:48 - angle
05:49 - F this angle corresponds to angle C so
05:54 - since angle C is
05:56 - 65째 the measure of angle f is also
06:01 - 65째 and last the measure of angle e is
06:05 - congruent to the measure of angle B
06:08 - since we find found the measure of angle
06:10 - B to be
06:12 - 80째 we know that the measure of angle e
06:15 - also has to be
06:17 - 80째 so now that we know what similar
06:20 - triangles are in our next lesson we're
06:23 - going to talk about how we can identify
06:25 - similar triangles so make sure you come
06:28 - back and watch
