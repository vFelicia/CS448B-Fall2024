00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:03 - and this is a video tutorial for the new
00:05 - Boston now in this series of tutorials
00:07 - we're going to be creating a user login
00:10 - and registration system or rather a user
00:13 - registration and login system we're
00:16 - going to create the login process first
00:18 - then create the register system the
00:22 - registration system the reason you
00:24 - should do it this way is because you
00:26 - want to make sure your login is
00:28 - processed correctly before you start to
00:30 - register your users it just works out
00:32 - generally a lot better this way and
00:34 - obviously just a few notes before we
00:38 - begin I'm going to be creating the login
00:41 - and register system with just two fields
00:45 - and that is the username and the
00:46 - password
00:47 - in fact no will include the first name
00:50 - in the last name as well the reason I'm
00:52 - not going to include things like email
00:53 - address address or whatever you whatever
00:57 - else you're planning to store for your
00:58 - users is because if we spend a lot of
01:03 - time creating extra fields in the
01:05 - tutorial we're going to be wasting
01:07 - valuable learning time whereas once
01:09 - you've completed the tutorial and you
01:11 - understand how fields are created and
01:13 - how we can register users then you can
01:15 - obviously go ahead and input your own
01:17 - unique field form fields so the first
01:22 - thing we need to do we're not going to
01:23 - be writing any code in this tutorial
01:26 - we're going to be coming over to PHP
01:29 - myadmin I'm going to be setting up our
01:30 - table that we're going to store user
01:32 - data and then what we're going to do is
01:34 - pop a few sort of piece of dummy data in
01:38 - there if you like so we're going to
01:39 - register a couple of users manually
01:41 - using phpMyAdmin so the first thing i've
01:45 - done is i've already created my database
01:47 - in PHP myadmin you should know how to do
01:50 - this
01:50 - so I've created my database now I need
01:52 - to create a table I'm going to call this
01:55 - table just simply users now we need to
01:58 - determine how many fields we need to
02:01 - store so the first field I'm going to
02:04 - store is let's just blank this so we can
02:06 - write some notes I'm going to feel the
02:08 - first field I'm going to store is the ID
02:10 - this is obviously going to be the unique
02:12 - field this is going to be
02:13 - primarykey and it's going to be
02:16 - autoincrement as well we also need to
02:20 - start obviously the username the
02:22 - password it's popped over the first name
02:26 - and we'll say Serling so these are the
02:29 - four fields or five fields that we need
02:32 - to include in our program we can also
02:35 - include things like register day
02:37 - registration date but we're not going to
02:41 - do that for now like I said the purpose
02:42 - of the tutorial is to show you how to
02:44 - include everything and put everything
02:47 - together so let's go ahead and create
02:50 - these fields let's delete that first of
02:52 - all remember is five fields so we type
02:55 - five in there and click go okay so now
02:59 - to set up each field so ID is obviously
03:02 - going to be an integer because it's
03:03 - going to be an auto incrementing value
03:05 - so let's go ahead we that's int by
03:09 - default and go ahead and we're going to
03:11 - set the index to primary because it's a
03:13 - unique field in our table and also a I
03:17 - which stands for Auto increment so for
03:19 - every value that's created for every row
03:21 - that's created this will increment by
03:24 - one giving each user a unique number
03:26 - starting from one okay so the next one
03:29 - is username then we have password then
03:34 - we have first-name and also we have
03:38 - surname and so for the username and
03:41 - password we're going to pick a varchar'
03:43 - datatype the same with the first name in
03:45 - the last name so we can do these well
03:46 - while we're selecting the others okay so
03:49 - the username and password I'm going to
03:51 - give a limit of both 30 characters the
03:55 - first name and the surname I'm going to
03:57 - say 40 now obviously you can change
03:59 - these limits yourself you can change
04:03 - them to whatever you want I'm just doing
04:05 - this for sort of ease of use and
04:07 - teaching but I generally I'd say that a
04:10 - username or password shouldn't be more
04:12 - than 30 characters and a first name and
04:14 - surname should be more than 40
04:15 - characters just in case we have an extra
04:17 - long name so we don't need to set any
04:19 - other properties for these we can go
04:21 - ahead and click Save down here and we'll
04:24 - just examine our structure of our table
04:27 - just to make sure everything's correct
04:28 - so we've got ID it's underlined to be no
04:31 - it's a primary key
04:32 - we've got auto increment on this under
04:34 - the extra and int is 11 characters
04:37 - that's up that you find this could be a
04:39 - small or medium int but we'll keep it
04:42 - this just in case we need to register
04:44 - lots and lots and lots of users username
04:46 - and password of both variable character
04:49 - variable characters and their length of
04:52 - 30 and first name and surname also
04:55 - variable characters and their length of
04:56 - 40 okay so with a set up our table let's
05:01 - go ahead and put some data inside of
05:03 - here now there's one thing to bear in
05:07 - mind we're going to be storing our
05:08 - password as an md5 hash that reminds me
05:12 - actually let's go back to our structure
05:13 - and let's change the password field here
05:17 - so let's click check that and then click
05:19 - the edit button let's change this to 32
05:23 - now the reason we're changing this to 32
05:25 - is we're storing the password as an md5
05:28 - hash therefore an md5 hash will always
05:32 - or more or less always most of the time
05:34 - equal with the length of 32 so whatever
05:38 - sort of length that passed but it is our
05:41 - md5 hash will typically be 32 characters
05:44 - so we're storing a 32 character password
05:48 - in here because that will be the md5
05:49 - hash and if you don't know what an md5
05:52 - hashes or you don't know how to create
05:54 - one with PHP and take a look at my other
05:57 - tutorial on md5 hashes and that will
06:01 - sort of walk you through what how we
06:02 - relate that to passwords okay so let's
06:07 - go ahead and insert some data now
06:09 - there's a couple of things we need to do
06:10 - with the password we can't just enter a
06:12 - normal password in here we need to an
06:14 - input an md5 hash and you'll see later
06:18 - on when we register our users we're
06:20 - going to convert the password that
06:21 - they've entered in a text field to an
06:23 - md5 hash before we insert it into the
06:25 - database but for now I'm going to create
06:28 - a PHP script too quickly and convert a
06:32 - password that I want to manually put
06:34 - into here so my username is going to be
06:36 - Alex
06:37 - we'll leave the password blank for now
06:39 - I'm going
06:39 - put my first and surname in and the
06:42 - password is going to be equal to the
06:44 - value password so my password is going
06:47 - to read password in fact we'll we'll do
06:50 - pass pass one two three that's a lot
06:52 - better so we don't get confused between
06:54 - field name and the actual password so
06:56 - I'm going to echo out md5 and in here
06:58 - I'm going to put pass one two three and
07:01 - this is going to return the md5 hash
07:05 - okay so I can just copy that and paste
07:07 - that into my database so obviously you
07:09 - won't have to do this when you're
07:10 - registering your users and I'm going to
07:13 - click go
07:13 - okay so there let's click browse to make
07:16 - sure the data is in there okay so we've
07:17 - got ID of one that's automatically
07:19 - updated that for us that's an ID of one
07:21 - use name is Alex password is this hash
07:24 - which is equivalent to pass one two
07:26 - three or the hash of pass one two three
07:30 - first-name Alex and surname Garret okay
07:33 - so now that we've registered or manually
07:36 - register the user we are pretty much
07:40 - done setting up our database setting up
07:42 - our table rather and inserting this
07:45 - value so in the next part what we're
07:48 - going to be doing is logging this user
07:49 - on
