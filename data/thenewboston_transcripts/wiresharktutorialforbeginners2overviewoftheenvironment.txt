00:00 - all righty mates welcome back and now
00:03 - that we have where shark downloaded and
00:05 - installed we're going to start figuring
00:06 - out how the heck to use it it looks kind
00:10 - of overwhelming at first just because
00:11 - there's so much stuff going on
00:13 - especially when you start capturing
00:14 - traffic but I'm going to be breaking
00:16 - down the interface showing you guys what
00:18 - all the different pieces do what ones
00:20 - you use what ones you really don't use
00:22 - that often and yeah nothing me talking
00:25 - let's go ahead and get started
00:27 - so the welcome screen whenever you first
00:29 - start Wireshark you're going to have
00:31 - this screen right here now a lot of
00:34 - these for example whenever you start
00:36 - capturing traffic then all your recent
00:39 - project files are going to be right here
00:41 - this little section will actually take
00:44 - you to the website that I showed you
00:45 - guys in the last video so if you just
00:48 - want to look through some traffic that
00:50 - other people captured and uploaded maybe
00:52 - you're curious about a specific type of
00:56 - network or something like that then you
00:57 - can download the sample files from here
00:59 - also they give you some other links like
01:02 - to their websites homepage user guide in
01:05 - some other help sections as well
01:08 - the main section that we use from here
01:11 - is this one right here so these are all
01:14 - the capture settings so we can either
01:17 - capture our own traffic however if you
01:19 - did download one of those sample files
01:21 - and you want to review that then if you
01:23 - just go to file open then you can choose
01:27 - whatever file you downloaded so this was
01:30 - the HTTP one that I told you guys
01:32 - download but I'm not going to open that
01:35 - because I'm going to show you guys how
01:36 - to capture your own traffic so in order
01:40 - to start listening for the traffic on
01:42 - your network you first need to choose an
01:45 - interface now depending on how your
01:47 - network set up and what next you have
01:49 - installed on your computer this section
01:51 - is going to be different for everyone so
01:54 - this is my main neck and right now I'm
01:57 - just sitting at a regular desktop and I
02:00 - have I believe it's on board um it came
02:03 - installed on my motherboard but if you
02:05 - guys have like other wireless cards that
02:07 - you bought then they're going to pop up
02:09 - here to you guys probably won't even
02:12 - have these
02:13 - because I have virtual machines
02:14 - installed on my computer and whenever
02:17 - you install a virtual machine then it
02:19 - comes with a virtual interface but just
02:22 - select your main one whatever it is for
02:24 - your computer and then you can hit start
02:27 - so what this is going to do is going to
02:29 - say okay this is how connected to the
02:32 - Internet start listening for traffic on
02:35 - that network now as you can see I'm not
02:39 - even going to any websites or anything
02:41 - like that however I do have a browser
02:42 - open so it's doing a bunch of stuff
02:46 - behind the scenes and that's what's kind
02:48 - of amazing that people don't realize is
02:50 - that whenever you're just like this all
02:53 - right
02:53 - got nothing going on just you know
02:56 - looking at my desktop your computer is
02:58 - doing a lot of crap as you guys can see
03:01 - so I'm just going to go to some other
03:05 - site and it doesn't matter what slice
03:07 - I'm going to right now so open your
03:09 - browser and start you know go to like
03:11 - two or three websites and then come back
03:13 - here and click stop now let me pull this
03:17 - back up don't mind what I'm doing right
03:19 - now this is just because I was playing
03:20 - around with this before the tutorial but
03:23 - you guys are going to see basically
03:25 - something like this now just a real
03:28 - brief overview and I'll talk to you guys
03:31 - about everything in detail but of course
03:33 - this is your main menu bar up here these
03:36 - are commonly used tools this is so you
03:40 - can filter specific packets and down
03:44 - here as it was pretty clear whenever you
03:48 - start capturing traffic or packets
03:51 - they're all going to pop up right here
03:53 - so the more people that you have on your
03:55 - network and the more websites that
03:57 - they're going to or whatever they're
03:58 - doing the more packets are going to have
04:00 - if it's just you then you know they
04:02 - probably won't be coming in that fast
04:04 - but if you just want to cycle through
04:06 - these and you can just click on the
04:09 - different ones or press up and down then
04:13 - you can see all of the different packets
04:16 - that are being transferred over your
04:19 - network and if you guys don't understand
04:21 - what any of this crap means then don't
04:23 - worry like I said we're going to be
04:24 - going into everything in detail I just
04:26 - want to give you a
04:27 - a little basic a broad overview of
04:29 - interface right now so whenever you
04:31 - click a packet then of course you're
04:34 - going to be able to look at more
04:36 - information about it now this middle
04:39 - section right here this is information
04:41 - about your packet in human readable form
04:44 - this bottom section we really don't use
04:47 - that much because this is just the bits
04:49 - view and actually if you right-click
04:50 - this and choose bits view so this is
04:54 - basically how your router and your NIC
04:56 - card are going to see you know the
04:58 - pulses of electricity that's why I said
05:01 - it's not really useful not that it's not
05:03 - important but you know we can't read
05:05 - this so to us humans we really don't
05:09 - want to see it that much so we are
05:11 - usually going to be looking at the
05:12 - individual packets and the information
05:14 - in human readable form and if you just
05:17 - want to hide this section down here then
05:20 - if you go to view and uncheck packet
05:24 - bytes then it's going to hide it right
05:26 - there so if you ever want to hide some
05:28 - of these sections then the packet list
05:31 - is the top one the packet details are
05:34 - details about that individual packet in
05:37 - human readable form and of course the
05:39 - bytes if for some reason you like
05:42 - looking at the ones and zeros then boom
05:44 - there you go
05:45 - now another thing that people like to do
05:47 - is maybe they let me pop that back up
05:51 - again maybe they actually want to see
05:54 - this in they want their layout arranged
05:56 - a little bit differently so maybe you
05:58 - want all the packets on the right hand
06:00 - side and the details on the left hand
06:02 - side maybe that's a cool layout so if
06:04 - you go to edit preferences these are
06:08 - your main Wireshark preferences now I
06:12 - say what are sharp because there isn't
06:15 - too much information about the actual
06:17 - packets and information this is pretty
06:19 - much just for the Wireshark environment
06:21 - the colors the layout how you want your
06:24 - sections arranged all this stuff so if
06:27 - you click the layout right here then you
06:31 - can just choose a really general layout
06:33 - so how do you want all your sections
06:36 - organized you can actually choose to you
06:39 - know not even display one at all
06:41 - and you can also choose some other stuff
06:43 - as well maybe I'll show you guys so you
06:47 - see in the packets you have a number
06:50 - which is pretty much just the ID the
06:52 - time of the capture the source where
06:54 - it's coming from where it's going to you
06:56 - know the protocol a bunch of information
06:58 - if you're like you know what I really
07:00 - don't care about this time that much you
07:03 - can actually uncheck that and then that
07:05 - column will be hidden so pretty much
07:08 - like I said she's going to go ahead and
07:11 - hit apply no ok so if you just ever want
07:15 - to control maybe hide some stuff maybe
07:17 - show some stuff organize your layout
07:19 - then you can go there and you're going
07:21 - to be good to go now one last thing that
07:24 - I'm going to recommend doing we hide
07:25 - this is this so if you go to view and
07:29 - then you go to name resolution make sure
07:32 - that you have this enabled for Mac layer
07:34 - so you know whenever you have a mac
07:37 - address it's pretty much it looks like a
07:38 - bunch of weird numbers well the first
07:41 - section of your mac address is actually
07:43 - there to identify the manufacturer or
07:45 - the distributor basically the company
07:47 - that made your network interface card so
07:50 - if you have this enabled then it's going
07:53 - to take those numbers and translate it
07:54 - to the company's name so that way it's
07:57 - going to say something like alright so
08:00 - right here like ASIS or ASIS whatever so
08:03 - they made this net card so that's why
08:07 - instead of having a weird long number
08:10 - like this you can actually see it it
08:13 - just says a sus and I don't know it's
08:16 - just a little bit more helpful to me at
08:18 - least
08:18 - so it takes this weird number and
08:20 - translates it for the name however what
08:23 - you probably don't want to do is you
08:25 - don't want to resolve just every single
08:27 - name because if you start traveling
08:29 - trying to pretty much translate all of
08:32 - these IP addresses then what it's going
08:34 - to do is it's going to try to connect to
08:36 - a DNS server every time and then you're
08:38 - going to have a lot more traffic kind of
08:40 - unnecessary traffic that you really
08:42 - don't care about so I know I'm kind of
08:45 - overwhelming you guys already but get
08:48 - your layout how you want it arranged you
08:51 - know all these panels all these sections
08:53 - display the ones you want
08:54 - by the ones that you don't want and once
08:57 - you got a decent feel of the environment
08:59 - then we can move on to the next video
09:00 - where we are going to be talking about
09:02 - the capture settings
