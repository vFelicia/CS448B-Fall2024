00:00 - and their user ID would then equal to
00:02 - now in this case we could then force
00:05 - this to be two so just sort of
00:08 - recreating a login system but doing it
00:12 - within one line
00:13 - now if we were to go back and refresh
00:16 - and I was to type in Billy Garrett and
00:20 - click save settings have been updated
00:23 - you saw the loading you should have seen
00:25 - the loading text to come up a bit just
00:29 - slightly then so you can you could see
00:31 - that this is obviously just depending on
00:34 - the service you know how it's running if
00:37 - I click browse now you can see that
00:39 - Billy Garrett has been changed to Billy
00:41 - Billy has been changed to Billy Guerra
00:43 - so obviously this variable here is
00:46 - dependent on the user that's currently
00:48 - logged in you know the system that
00:51 - you've have in place on your site
00:53 - however you can now start to see how
00:56 - effective this is with updating values
00:58 - depending on the which user has logged
01:00 - in now if you wanted to go ahead and say
01:03 - create a few of these fields I'm just
01:06 - going to go ahead and show you how easy
01:08 - this would be so we have name and then
01:11 - want to copy this and paste it down here
01:13 - and I'm gonna go ahead and type in let's
01:17 - say email now we won't again create any
01:22 - validation we'll just go ahead and
01:24 - update this value so we've got this
01:27 - email value here this email field here
01:30 - let's go ahead and press Enter
01:32 - you can see we've now got a name and
01:34 - email now I'm gonna go ahead and update
01:37 - my database table accordingly I'm gonna
01:40 - add a new field on the end called email
01:42 - the type we can set as 255 as a variable
01:46 - character we now have an email field on
01:48 - so at the moment Alex G and Billy
01:51 - Garrett don't have an email now we're
01:53 - currently logged in as Billy in
01:56 - quotation marks because we're not
01:57 - actually logged in so we're logged in as
02:00 - Billy Garrett currently we've set this
02:02 - to two so now we can go ahead and make
02:04 - the appropriate changes elsewhere to
02:07 - update these values as well so let's say
02:09 - you've added this email input field in
02:12 - here
02:12 - over in Ajax Jas all you'd need to do is
02:15 - go ahead and create a new variable here
02:19 - grabbing the email as well as the name
02:22 - so via email is now equal to e mail dot
02:26 - Val remember we renamed this here email
02:29 - as opposed to name what we then do is we
02:32 - would pass the email value as well as
02:36 - name so we we would create a comma here
02:38 - an email email so we're sending another
02:43 - variable called email was sent well
02:44 - we're sending two variables name and
02:46 - email the value of name is name from
02:49 - here and the value of email is email
02:52 - from here so now that we've done that
02:54 - we've successfully updated Ajax to j/s
02:58 - we come over to settings dot PHP and we
03:00 - need to also check if the email fit or
03:04 - post data is set so we create a comma
03:08 - because the it'ss is set in is set
03:11 - function in PHP takes multiple values so
03:15 - if the name and email are set we can go
03:18 - ahead and again it copy and paste this
03:21 - down and email email here so it's
03:27 - literally a matter of just duplicating
03:29 - for each field now we need to go ahead
03:31 - and update our query so we can go ahead
03:34 - and update users' set name equals name
03:36 - we've done that now we also want to
03:39 - update where I'm sorry set email equals
03:44 - email so now we have updated our users
03:49 - table we've set the name is equal to the
03:51 - name we've specified and the email is
03:53 - equal to the email we've specified where
03:57 - user ID blah blah blah like we've
03:59 - already discussed so now what's going to
04:01 - happen is we can not only update one at
04:04 - a time but update multiple fields at a
04:06 - time so at the moment we're logged in as
04:09 - Billy Garrett and we're logged in as the
04:12 - user ID - so the name is Billy Garrett
04:14 - and the
04:15 - is nothing let's go ahead and test this
04:18 - out I'm gonna put the name as Billy and
04:20 - I'm going to set the email as Billy at
04:24 - PHP academy' the org when I click save
04:28 - settings have been updated so the query
04:30 - it successfully ran here this query ran
04:33 - successfully when we browse again you
04:36 - can see that the email has been updated
04:37 - and the names changed back to Billy so
04:40 - now I'm going to log back in as Alex log
04:42 - back in again in quotation marks because
04:44 - we're not actually logged in I'm gonna
04:46 - change the user ID to one and I'm gonna
04:48 - set the name to Alex and the email
04:50 - address accordingly so we change this
04:52 - here back to one assuming we've now
04:55 - logged in as a different person Alex and
04:58 - Alex are PHP academy' dog click Save you
05:03 - saw that it loading text now you've seen
05:05 - settings have been updated back to the
05:07 - database table and you can see that the
05:10 - name and email now correspond to the two
05:13 - values that we put into these fields
05:14 - here so using this system is extremely
05:17 - easy and quick and it's also easy to
05:21 - change or update for the fields that you
05:24 - want to you know add into the initial
05:28 - form here so you can add as many fields
05:30 - as you like with as much data clicking
05:33 - save will show your loading button and
05:35 - then will tell you if your settings have
05:37 - been updated or not just one quick thing
05:40 - before we leave if I was to for example
05:43 - try and mess up this query so I'll just
05:45 - put up DTE instead of update when we now
05:49 - go ahead to try and save it says there
05:51 - was an error updating your settings so
05:54 - we are rich you know we're receiving
05:56 - this error message appropriately because
05:59 - our query has failed
06:01 - so that's updating database table values
06:04 - based on a form using jQuery
