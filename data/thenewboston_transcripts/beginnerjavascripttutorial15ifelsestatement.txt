00:00 - all right guys it's Bucky and welcome to
00:02 - your 15th JavaScript tutorial and in
00:04 - this tutorial like I said we're going to
00:06 - be going over a kind of more complex if
00:09 - statement so in the last tutorial I
00:11 - showed you guys how to make a basic if
00:12 - statement and we pretty much gave it a
00:15 - test and if that test was true it ran a
00:18 - bit of code but if that test was false
00:21 - then it didn't do anything well now are
00:23 - we're going to be doing it is telling it
00:26 - if it's false instead of not doing
00:28 - anything give it another op option so if
00:31 - it's true do this if it's false do that
00:34 - so before we said if it's true do this
00:36 - if it's false do nothing and now we're
00:38 - saying if it's true do this if it's
00:39 - false do that so pretty simple we're
00:42 - pretty much making it do something no
00:43 - matter what so let's go ahead and make
00:46 - well let me show you guys the basic
00:47 - syntax of this in order to make an if
00:50 - else statement and that's what this is
00:52 - called if else we go ahead and read if
00:55 - statement and we're going to give it a
00:57 - test right here if that test is true
00:59 - we're going to run this bit of code
01:01 - right here let's say we have document
01:04 - write um and just write
01:07 - like I love Hot Pockets good enough so
01:12 - now if this test is true we run this bit
01:14 - of code just like we did before this is
01:16 - exactly identical but now let's stick
01:19 - another piece onto this we're going to
01:21 - go ahead and write the word else now go
01:24 - ahead and add brackets for this and
01:26 - instead of doing nothing if to test this
01:28 - false it's going to do this this bit of
01:30 - code right here so
01:32 - document
01:35 - right um I love nah let's give it
01:39 - something like I
01:42 - love strawberry so this is an unhealthy
01:46 - and this is healthy so you know we got
01:48 - kind of a contrast going on there so now
01:51 - let's go ahead and give it a really
01:52 - simple test let's just go ahead and test
01:54 - two numbers can't be easier than that so
01:57 - if 2 equals 2 and remember we can't use
02:00 - one equal sign we have to use two
02:02 - because we only use one equal sign
02:05 - whenever we're setting a variable equal
02:07 - to a value whenever we're just testing
02:09 - two values to make sure they equal each
02:11 - other we use two equal signs so right
02:14 - now we're saying all right if 2 equals 2
02:17 - do this if two doesn't equal two do this
02:21 - so let's go ahead and save it and
02:23 - refresh it and see what it says I love
02:26 - Hot Pockets so that's why the first one
02:28 - got executed
02:30 - but what if they didn't equal each other
02:32 - what if saying all right if 2 equals 65
02:35 - well we know that 2 does not equal 65
02:38 - just doesn't make sense so I was going
02:39 - to say all right if 2 equal 65 do this
02:42 - well it doesn't so I'm not going to do
02:44 - that so I guess I have to do this I love
02:47 - strawberries so let's go ahead and save
02:49 - this and see what we get I love
02:52 - strawberries just as we thought so aside
02:55 - from having just two values equal each
02:57 - other we can have two variables equal
02:59 - each other for example if we had um
03:03 - VAR uh blue equal
03:07 - 43 and VAR red
03:11 - equal 76 then we can go ahead and we can
03:14 - test if blue is equal to Red which they
03:19 - aren't so it's going to say I love
03:22 - strawberries right here check it out I
03:25 - love strawberries but if they are equal
03:27 - to each other 43 and 43
03:30 - who I have
03:31 - 743 check it out I love Hot Pockets so
03:35 - again this is more common to compare two
03:37 - variables against each other you can
03:39 - also take a variable and compare it to a
03:41 - number at 43 =
03:44 - 43 just like that I love Hot Pockets so
03:48 - aside from this what you can do is you
03:50 - can use all your other comparison
03:52 - operators too if
03:54 - 43 is not equal to 43 then let's see
03:58 - what happens it says I love strawberries
04:01 - so you're saying all right if 43 is
04:04 - different than 43 do this well I'm not
04:07 - going to do that because they're the
04:09 - same so if they're the same go ahead and
04:11 - do this and that's why I pr now I love
04:13 - strawberries now let's go ahead and uh
04:16 - test are greater than letin and 587 and
04:20 - 43 so if blue is greater than 43 or
04:25 - let's go ahead and type red right there
04:28 - so if 58 7 is greater than red go ahead
04:32 - and do this if 507 587 is not greater
04:37 - than red go ahead and do this so since
04:40 - it is greater than red and 587 is more
04:44 - than 43 it's going to go ahead and print
04:46 - out I love Hot Pockets if I go ahead and
04:49 - save that right there I love Hot Pockets
04:51 - and of course we can do less than less
04:54 - than or equal to greater than or equal
04:56 - to double equals not equals and all
04:59 - those good stuff but anyways that's the
05:01 - point I'm trying to make an IFL
05:03 - statement is basically this let me go
05:06 - ahead and cut this an if statement
05:09 - pretty much takes a test and if it's
05:11 - true it runs a bit of code if it's not
05:14 - true it doesn't do anything what an if
05:17 - El statement does is it pretty much
05:19 - gives you that second option if it's not
05:21 - true instead of not doing anything run
05:24 - this bit of code instead so either way
05:27 - your computer is going to get stuck
05:28 - doing something where as before if it
05:31 - wasn't true it could Escape take the
05:33 - easy way out and do nothing so there you
05:35 - have it a basic IFL statement and why
05:38 - they are useful and what they do so
05:41 - don't forget to go over your comparison
05:43 - operators make sure you understand all
05:45 - of those and make sure you understand
05:47 - the basics of an if else statement you
05:49 - pretty much are giving your computer a
05:51 - decision you're either going to do this
05:53 - or do this based on a test so now that
05:56 - you understand that you're ready to move
05:58 - on to the next topic and that is things
06:01 - might get confusing but it's actually
06:03 - nesting so things might get a little
06:06 - rough but trust me you need to
06:08 - understand the next topic it's going to
06:10 - be extremely helpful to you so thank you
06:12 - guys for watching uh don't forget to
06:13 - subscribe and I'll see you guys later
