00:01 - today we're going to talk about
00:03 - factoring and we're going to start off
00:05 - with finding the greatest common factor
00:08 - which I'm sure you've done before you
00:12 - just might not have known what you're
00:14 - doing so when we find our greatest
00:16 - common factor we're going to write the
00:19 - number and we're going to list all the
00:22 - numbers that divide evenly into that so
00:28 - our first example is going to be with 18
00:30 - and 30 so if we go through the list of
00:34 - numbers we know that 18 is divisible by
00:39 - 2 x 3 and x 6 30 is divisible by 2 3 5 &
01:01 - 6 so when we found the greatest common
01:05 - factor we're finding the largest number
01:10 - that we can pull out of both of these
01:13 - and it has to be the same number so if
01:16 - you look they both share two in common
01:19 - but that's not the greatest common
01:22 - factor they will share three but that's
01:24 - not the greatest common factor either
01:27 - but they both share a six and since that
01:32 - is the largest number that they are both
01:34 - divisible by evenly divisible by 6 is
01:39 - our greatest common factor okay so we're
01:48 - going to do a couple more examples and
01:50 - then we're going to talk about the
01:51 - greatest common monomial factor which
01:55 - has to deal with monomial or binomial
01:58 - expressions and factoring out of my no
02:01 - monomial so we're going to list these
02:04 - two numbers the exact same way we did
02:06 - before and we're just going through all
02:09 - the numbers that are that
02:12 - evenly divided into twenty eight and
02:14 - forty nine so 28 is divisible by four
02:20 - and seven and that's it 49 is divisible
02:30 - by seven and that's it so that means
02:37 - that our GCF is the biggest number that
02:40 - they are both evenly divisible by which
02:43 - for this one happens to be seven so this
02:49 - is our last example for a greatest
02:52 - common factor so 48 is divisible by 2 3
03:03 - 4 6 & 8 72 is divisible by 2 3 4 4690 8
03:27 - 9 and 12 and I actually forgot one more
03:31 - for 48 because if you divide 48 by four
03:35 - you get 12 so that means it's also
03:38 - evenly divisible by 12 so as you can see
03:42 - 12 is going to be our greatest common
03:45 - factor now if you're not sure how I got
03:49 - all of these numbers all I did was went
03:52 - down a number line and figured out which
03:56 - numbers are 48 and 72 are evenly
04:00 - divisible by once you get used to
04:03 - finding the GCF it'll be easier to list
04:07 - the factors out but um
04:15 - until then sometimes it's just guests in
04:18 - check work so now we're going to switch
04:21 - gears and talk about the greatest common
04:24 - monomial factor so it has the same idea
04:29 - as finding just the greatest common
04:31 - factor but we're talking about
04:35 - expressions polynomial expressions and
04:37 - what we're trying to do is figure out
04:40 - what is the largest monomial factor that
04:46 - we can pull out of both so the way we're
04:48 - going to approach this is we're gonna
04:51 - this is how you write my bad when we
04:58 - factor this out what we're going to do
05:01 - is we end up doing reverse distribution
05:04 - so we're going to have a number here and
05:08 - then a expression in the parentheses so
05:14 - we're going to look at each one of these
05:15 - terms 12 and 15 each one of these parts
05:21 - of this term so we're going to look
05:23 - first at the the coefficients which are
05:26 - 12 and 15 and if we list those factors
05:31 - out 12 is divisible by 2 and 3 and 4 and
05:39 - 6 and 15 is divisible by 3 and five so
05:46 - we can pull out of three of both of
05:48 - these so what we do is divide each
05:51 - number by three so 12 divided by 3 is 4
05:56 - 15 divided by 3 is 5 so we're going to
06:01 - outside is going to be a three and then
06:05 - it's going to be a for something plus of
06:09 - five something now we look at the second
06:13 - number or term which is a we have an
06:17 - eight cubed here and an a here so what
06:21 - is the largest term that we can pull out
06:24 - of those 2a terms well we can pull out
06:28 - an
06:29 - and then if we have a if we have an a
06:35 - out here a times how many a's will give
06:40 - us a to the third well if you remember
06:42 - our exponent rules this needs to be an a
06:46 - squared because when we multiply we add
06:48 - our exponents and this right here since
06:51 - we've divided by n a there's going to be
06:53 - no a right there then we're going to do
06:55 - the same thing with be we're going to
06:58 - look at the beater meeeeee and we're
06:59 - going to decide how many bees we can
07:01 - pull out of both of these terms and have
07:05 - it divided evenly so this is B to the
07:09 - one and this is B to the three so all we
07:12 - can take out is a B and here the same
07:17 - thing if you have B to the one and you /
07:19 - b you're going to have no bees left in
07:24 - this term and for this one using our
07:27 - exponent rules again we know that this
07:29 - has to be B squared so we're going to do
07:37 - one more example with greatest common
07:40 - monomial factors so here we have a
07:47 - trinomial but the process is going to be
07:51 - the same as it was before we're going to
07:54 - have a number a monomial out here and
07:58 - some expression inside these parentheses
08:02 - so the question we always ask ourselves
08:04 - when we solve when we factor a binomial
08:09 - origin and wheel or any polynomial is
08:12 - what is the biggest number I can pull
08:15 - out of each one of these terms evenly so
08:20 - 13 as you guys probably know is a prime
08:24 - number it's only divisible by itself and
08:27 - one and if you double check 26 is also
08:33 - divisible by 13 as well as 39 so we can
08:37 - pull out a 13 from each one of these and
08:39 - we're going to get with one
08:41 - + 26 / 13 is two plus 30 or sorry that
08:49 - should be a minus minus and 39 / 13 is
08:57 - three and then this has an M and M
09:00 - squared and then I'm cute so the largest
09:04 - amount of Em's we can pull out of each
09:06 - one of these terms is just one so you're
09:10 - just left with one here M squared
09:13 - divided by M leaves you with one M and M
09:17 - cube divided by M leaves you with M
09:20 - squared and that's all there really is
09:26 - to factoring so that's all we're going
09:29 - to do today we'll make sure you come
09:30 - back and watch when we're gonna go over
09:34 - how to factor the difference of two
09:37 - squares
