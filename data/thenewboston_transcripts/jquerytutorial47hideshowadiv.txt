00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:03 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this example video we are going to
00:08 - take a look at how to hide and show a
00:10 - div with some text inside of it and also
00:14 - then change the show and hide buttons
00:17 - simultaneously so let's go ahead and
00:20 - start to build up our message that we
00:22 - want to display and then we're gonna
00:24 - have a button or a link that's going to
00:26 - allow us to hide and show it so we're
00:29 - essentially toggling it
00:30 - okay so let's create our div I'm going
00:34 - to give this an ID of message just a
00:37 - generic name for the text that's going
00:39 - to be inside of it inside I am going to
00:42 - just paste in some example text some
00:45 - Latin text now the div ID I'm going to
00:49 - style in line which I've always said I
00:51 - don't recommend however for the purpose
00:53 - of this tutorial and just to make things
00:55 - quick I will just create a style inside
00:58 - of here so the first thing I'm going to
01:00 - do is just set a width I'm then going to
01:04 - set a border to this and that's gonna be
01:09 - one pixel solid and I'm gonna have it a
01:13 - sort of gray color and I'm also gonna
01:16 - set some padding so padding 10 pixels
01:20 - okay so let's preview that in our
01:22 - browser you can see that we've got some
01:24 - text inside of a div with just a light
01:27 - gray border okay so let's go over to our
01:30 - text editor and create the link above
01:32 - this div that's going to hide and show
01:35 - it so I'm just going to create a link
01:37 - here the link is going to be just a hash
01:39 - because we're not actually linking to
01:41 - anything but the idea of this is going
01:44 - to be show or hide show and then here
01:49 - the initial text that we're going to
01:50 - display will be hide so now if we
01:54 - preview that that's going to look like
01:55 - that so the idea that we want to come
01:59 - across is when we press hide this will
02:02 - actually hide this whole area here the
02:05 - bordered area and then this hide text
02:07 - will change to show and then when we
02:10 - click on show this will be
02:12 - shown once again and then again this
02:15 - will change to hide so it's really just
02:17 - a case of this link changing and this
02:19 - being shown or hidden and then shown
02:22 - again so let's go ahead and create our
02:25 - JavaScript file and I'm going to call
02:28 - this message Jas and I'm gonna include
02:33 - that in my page just under here so
02:36 - script type is text forward slash
02:41 - JavaScript and we'll include that by
02:44 - putting that in the source so Jas
02:46 - forward slash message Jas okay so now
02:50 - that we've done that we want to go ahead
02:51 - and actually edit our message gif file
02:54 - to handle the events based around this
02:56 - link so the first thing we want to do is
02:59 - actually toggle this hide and show
03:01 - button and what I mean by toggle is
03:04 - we've looked at in this series how to
03:07 - actually change something based on when
03:10 - we for example click on it so what I'm
03:12 - going to do is reference this button and
03:16 - that's called hide show and then I'm
03:19 - gonna say dot toggle so we're using the
03:21 - dot toggle or the toggle event handler
03:23 - now inside here we need two functions
03:26 - the first function is going to be what
03:28 - happens when this link is clicked for
03:30 - the first time and then the second
03:32 - function is going to be what happens
03:34 - when it is clicked again and we revert
03:36 - back to its original state
03:37 - so we're toggling between two different
03:39 - states so I'm going to create one
03:41 - function and it's block and then I'm
03:44 - going to separate this by a comma and
03:45 - create another function and this block
03:48 - now let's pull these blocks down so we
03:50 - can work with it a bit easier so now in
03:54 - here this is the first state so we'll
03:58 - call that state 1 and in here this is
04:02 - state 2 so when we click this button
04:04 - state 1 will happen then we when we
04:07 - click it again state 2 will happen when
04:09 - we click the link again it will revert
04:11 - back to the original state and it will
04:13 - switch between the two so what we
04:15 - actually want to do is we want to modify
04:17 - the text here hide to show instead so we
04:22 - can again reference hide show
04:25 - but this time we use the text function
04:27 - to change the text within this link so
04:30 - essentially what we're doing is we are
04:32 - changing this text here so we can
04:35 - specify that when it's clicked we want
04:37 - to show now in the second state we want
04:43 - to do exactly the same thing so we can
04:45 - just copy and paste this down here
04:47 - however we want it to display hired
04:49 - instead okay so let's go over to our
04:53 - browser and preview these changes so at
04:55 - the moment the button shows hide when I
04:57 - click on it it now shows show when I
05:00 - click on again it goes back to hide and
05:03 - this will just continue because we've
05:05 - used the toggle event handler okay so
05:08 - that's all well and good but now we
05:09 - actually need to hide this div now there
05:12 - are two ways that we could do it we
05:14 - could include it inside this buttons
05:16 - functionality or we can do it outside
05:17 - I'm going to do it outside for the
05:20 - purposes of this tutorial and then I'm
05:21 - going to show you the inside as well
05:23 - okay so we need an event handler for our
05:28 - message so we're referencing our message
05:30 - div and we're going to say dot actually
05:36 - no we don't we need to show you need to
05:38 - say hide show so hide show dot click
05:42 - okay and then this will in itself this
05:45 - is in itself an event handler we need a
05:48 - function inside of here that will do
05:50 - something every time we click this hide
05:53 - show button now what we can actually do
05:55 - in this case is we can reference the
05:58 - message div and actually just use the
06:01 - toggle function now the toggle function
06:03 - will work exactly the same as this event
06:05 - handler but it'll just hide and show
06:08 - this message div every time we click on
06:10 - the hide show link so when we click this
06:13 - link this will disappear then it will
06:15 - toggle back to it being reappeared so
06:18 - let's just check out how that works so
06:20 - at the moment we've got a hide button
06:22 - when we click on hide you can see that
06:24 - the div has been hidden when we cook
06:26 - show it's toggled back to its original
06:28 - state and it's now visible and we can
06:31 - continue to do this over and over again
06:33 - now obviously including this
06:38 - code here is entirely unnecessary what
06:41 - we could actually do is we could copy
06:43 - and paste this here and delete this here
06:47 - and we could actually place it inside of
06:52 - here
06:53 - so what's happening is when we click
06:56 - this a hide/show button the toggle event
06:59 - is triggered we hide the div inside of
07:06 - this bit here so we could hide the
07:09 - message and then exactly the same in
07:17 - here but we could show it so we've
07:19 - actually every time we've pressed the
07:22 - top at the hide/show link we change the
07:26 - text to show and we hide the message div
07:28 - when we press it again we hide it we
07:31 - give the detects the display of hide but
07:34 - we actually show the div so now if we
07:36 - refresh you can see that this works in
07:38 - exactly the same way so there's a
07:41 - variety of different ways you can
07:43 - actually create things like this however
07:46 - this basic functionality is extremely
07:48 - useful for any any anything you want to
07:51 - hide and show now this could apply to
07:54 - menu options for example you could have
07:56 - a tiered menu with subcategories so when
07:59 - you click on say the main category
08:01 - you'll show a list of subcategories you
08:03 - can then click on the main menu again to
08:05 - hide these it can be used for a control
08:08 - panel for example for a user if you have
08:11 - particular settings you wanted the user
08:13 - to change but you wanted to keep them
08:15 - all hidden and shown you can actually
08:17 - allow the user to show certain parts of
08:20 - the settings that they can change so I'm
08:22 - sure you've seen this example used on a
08:26 - wide variety of websites however the
08:29 - functionality behind it is actually
08:32 - quite basic so just by using this code
08:34 - we've enabled this div to be shown and
08:37 - what are the visibility to be hidden and
08:39 - shown and also change the text of the
08:42 - button using the text function as well
