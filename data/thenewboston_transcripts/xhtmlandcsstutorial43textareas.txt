00:00 - welcome back guys welcome to your 43rd
00:02 - tutorial and in this story I'm gonna be
00:04 - talking about another form element and
00:06 - this element is actually called a text
00:08 - area now a text area the most simple way
00:12 - I can put it is you know those single
00:14 - line text fields that we had before it's
00:17 - just a big text field now what is the
00:20 - point of having you know a text area
00:23 - then well certain times when you're
00:25 - making forms you're going to kind of
00:27 - want to push your user in leaving more
00:29 - than a single line of text for example
00:31 - if they were like on a dating website
00:33 - and they need to leave a biographer your
00:35 - about themselves or maybe they're
00:37 - posting an ad on eBay and they need to
00:40 - write a description about their item
00:42 - this takes more than a single line of
00:45 - text so whenever you want the user to
00:47 - enter like one word give them a single
00:50 - line of text but whenever you want to
00:51 - have them enter like a couple paragraphs
00:53 - you're gonna need to give them a text
00:55 - area so that's where we're going to be
00:57 - doing in this tutorial so the first
00:59 - thing that I want to teach you guys is
01:01 - exactly how to add that text area and
01:03 - you do that by using the tags can you
01:06 - guys guess text area and you also end it
01:10 - with can you guys guess this text area
01:14 - now of course just like every other tag
01:17 - it and I really talked about every other
01:19 - form element it takes the name and let's
01:21 - go ahead and make that dating website
01:22 - we'll have this area be the biography
01:25 - and by the way by default it has you can
01:29 - have text in it like type something here
01:33 - and whenever you save this and refresh
01:36 - it that is the text that appears in the
01:39 - text area but in general you probably
01:42 - want to put something about it like tell
01:44 - me about yourself right there so now
01:48 - whoa actually not right there
01:51 - embarrassing so tell me about yourself
01:56 - and then go ahead and add the line break
01:58 - so it doesn't look weird and refresh it
02:00 - and check it out so this would be you
02:02 - know the startup of awesome dating
02:04 - website where you know you signed up and
02:06 - now you got to fill in your biography
02:08 - telling them bragging about yourself and
02:11 - you know how much money you make
02:13 - and how good your eyes look so you know
02:15 - you can go ahead and delete this and
02:17 - start typing but you know you're the
02:20 - designer of this website and you say
02:21 - this is not nearly enough space for me
02:24 - to brag about myself I need this to be
02:26 - wider and taller well thank God you got
02:30 - me because I'm gonna show you how to do
02:31 - that
02:32 - unlike height and width this attribute
02:36 - is a little bit different it's actually
02:37 - made up of rows and columns now the
02:40 - exact size of these rows and columns I'm
02:42 - not even sure of myself but I think they
02:44 - differ from browser to browser but
02:46 - anyways for if you want it to be taller
02:48 - you nee need to change the height of the
02:51 - rows I think it must be like two by
02:53 - default so let's go ahead and push up to
02:55 - eight and now let's save this in refresh
02:57 - and check it out our text area now gets
03:00 - why is this little thing right here oh I
03:04 - didn't even know you could do that that
03:05 - must be something new in Google Chrome
03:07 - that's pretty cool this is my first time
03:10 - figuring this out anyways well by
03:13 - default you see that the rows get taller
03:16 - really texting me in the middle of a
03:18 - tutorial let's see who it is and Bayer
03:24 - Singh I'm not even going to tell you
03:25 - guys who that was because it is too
03:27 - embarrassing actually
03:28 - so anyways Rose changes the height of it
03:32 - and change the width of it just go ahead
03:33 - and put C Oh LS this stands for columns
03:37 - but who the heck wants to type out
03:38 - columns evidently not the people who
03:40 - made this up so let's go ahead and
03:42 - change this to 40 or something and save
03:44 - it and see what we got
03:46 - refresh it and now it's 40 columns
03:49 - however long the column is wide so now
03:52 - you can see that this is probably enough
03:54 - area for me to give them a good
03:57 - biography about myself so what can I say
03:59 - to persuade the ladies to date me well
04:02 - my name is Bucky and I have an
04:05 - overactive bladder that would probably
04:08 - persuade them and then I'll you know
04:10 - drawn the punch line want to get dinner
04:13 - sometime
04:13 - so this is usually when I go out that's
04:16 - the line I usually use and it works
04:19 - about 100% of the time so you know if
04:21 - you ever get stuck you can use my line
04:23 - so
04:24 - you're welcome for teaching you about
04:26 - text areas and you're also welcome about
04:28 - giving you a good pickup line whenever
04:30 - you go out to clubs and stuff so anyways
