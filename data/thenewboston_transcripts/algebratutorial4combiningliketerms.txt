00:00 - so today we're going to talk about how
00:04 - we combine like terms and when I say
00:07 - combining like terms what I mean is
00:10 - we're going to collect each term which
00:14 - is each one of these things right here
00:18 - so that the similar ones we add and
00:22 - subtract to each other so for this first
00:26 - one I have 8x plus 5y minus 17 X well
00:32 - since each one of these has an X in it I
00:36 - can add this one and this one together
00:41 - so 8x minus 17 X is negative 9 X plus 5y
00:49 - well since Y this one has X and this one
00:52 - has Y we can't combine those because
00:55 - they're not like terms so this is all we
00:58 - can do with this particular one we're
01:01 - going to do the same thing with this one
01:03 - this has an X this has an X this is just
01:07 - a constant so we're going to combine
01:09 - these 7x - night or excuse me 7 X plus
01:15 - negative 11 gives me negative 4x and
01:19 - then minus 8 so sometimes when you start
01:28 - combining like terms you might want to
01:30 - circle it so you see which one's you add
01:33 - together especially when you have more
01:35 - than one term so we have 3 a negative 9
01:41 - a 2 a 5c and negative C so now we're
01:53 - going to add these together 3 a minus 9
01:59 - a gives me negative 6
02:02 - a plus 2 a gives me negative 4a plus 5 C
02:09 - minus C gives me 4 C
02:12 - okay now this one is a little bit more
02:17 - difficult than any of the ones we've
02:19 - done before because we have terms that
02:24 - have a squared in them so first we're
02:27 - going to look for all the similar terms
02:33 - so this is three X Y this is four X Y
02:38 - and this one has x squared Y and Y and X
02:42 - Y squared
02:44 - well these this one is not similar to
02:52 - the other three because this one has x
02:57 - squared Y this one's just X Y XY XY
03:01 - squared and this one is not similar for
03:04 - the exact same reason so we're going to
03:07 - add these two together we're going at 7
03:09 - X Y and then we just have to recopy this
03:13 - second part because we don't have any
03:15 - terms similar to those okay now this one
03:21 - is a little more tricky so I'm going to
03:25 - just going to circle all the like ones
03:27 - in the same color so this is 5y squared
03:30 - X this is x squared Y this is oh look
03:34 - this is another y squared X here and
03:38 - that's all we have for y squared X's
03:42 - okay look this one is negative 2x
03:46 - squared Y and this is negative x squared
03:51 - Y and then we have 2 XY + 3 X Y so now
03:59 - we're going to add these all each term
04:01 - together so we're going to add these two
04:05 - those two and those two so 5y squared X
04:12 - plus 8y squared X gives me 13 Y squared
04:17 - X negative 2 x squared y minus x squared
04:23 - Y gives me negative 3x squared y
04:26 - and 2xy plus 3xy gives me positive 5x y
04:34 - now this one's a lot simpler each one of
04:37 - these terms has an A in it so we're just
04:39 - going to add them together 11 plus 30 a
04:44 - gives you 41 a minus 18 gives us 23 a so
04:54 - that's how we're doing with combining
04:55 - like terms but make sure you come back
04:58 - and we're going to talk about solving
05:01 - equations
