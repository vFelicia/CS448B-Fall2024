00:00 - what is going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - 49th tutorial in the udk and in this
00:05 - tutorial i'm going to be teaching you
00:07 - guys about something called a gate so in
00:10 - order to use the gate as you can see i
00:11 - deleted that little delay go ahead and
00:14 - right click
00:15 - new action and under miscellaneous
00:17 - you're going to have this option called
00:19 - a gate make sure you don't choose the
00:21 - and gate that's something a little bit
00:22 - different just go ahead and choose
00:24 - normal gate
00:25 - now what a gate is
00:27 - it basically represents a real life gate
00:30 - so
00:31 - it usually goes in between an event
00:34 - and the action that you want to happen
00:36 - now by default most of the time you're
00:39 - going to be able to walk right through
00:41 - your gate and hit your action so for
00:43 - example
00:44 - whenever we touch that light switch it's
00:46 - going to go in the gate
00:48 - right out the gate and it's going to
00:50 - turn on that light so by default if we
00:52 - go ahead and x out of this right now and
00:54 - hit play from here
00:56 - we're going to go hit that light switch
00:57 - turn on the light just like normal so
01:00 - we're saying all right that's kind of uh
01:02 - useless why would they even have gate in
01:04 - there we'll check it out
01:06 - this gate also has the option of being
01:08 - closed now if you look at this just like
01:11 - real life and this is a path if this
01:14 - gate is closed whenever you touch this
01:16 - light switch right here and try to get
01:18 - to this action over here if this case
01:21 - closed you're never going to be able to
01:22 - get this this action
01:24 - so if you're saying all right so gate
01:26 - can be open and allow it to pass through
01:29 - or closed and allow the event from ever
01:32 - hitting the action so how do you close
01:35 - this gate well this gate and all gates
01:38 - have a variable called be open
01:41 - now if it's set to true
01:43 - then your information is just going to
01:45 - pass right through
01:46 - one side and out the other just like
01:48 - normal however if this be open is set to
01:52 - false then that means your gate is
01:54 - closed so true means your gates open and
01:57 - everything is just running fine
01:59 - false means the gate is closed and this
02:02 - event is never going to kick off this
02:04 - action
02:05 - so saying all right makes sense so how
02:08 - do you close this gate
02:10 - well there are a couple different ways
02:11 - that you can close this gate but
02:14 - the most common way is to put an auto
02:17 - close count and this means that your
02:19 - gate automatically co closes after it
02:22 - has been activated a certain number of
02:24 - times so let me go ahead and change this
02:26 - to two or something like that you can
02:28 - change it to three if you want or maybe
02:30 - even four
02:31 - or five if you're in that
02:34 - you know go ahead but anyways i'm just
02:35 - going to go ahead and put two and what
02:37 - this means is
02:38 - basically this is what's going to happen
02:40 - in my game
02:41 - the user is going to hit the light
02:42 - switch and since this is the first time
02:44 - using the gate the light's going to turn
02:47 - on just like normal
02:48 - the next time the user is going to hit
02:50 - the light switch and since this is a
02:52 - second time using the gate the lights
02:55 - going to turn on just like normal
02:57 - however the third time the user tries to
02:59 - use the gate is going to say uh uh my
03:01 - gate is closed now so this light ain't
03:04 - turning on haas so let me go ahead and x
03:07 - out of that but before we do you're
03:09 - going to see a problem right now we have
03:11 - functionality to turn on the light but
03:14 - we don't have the functionality to turn
03:16 - off the light so that may look a little
03:18 - weird whenever you're playing our game
03:20 - so go ahead and hit untouched and turn
03:22 - off and now x out of this in our game
03:25 - should work fine so go ahead and right
03:27 - click play from here
03:29 - and check it out
03:30 - first time i hit my switch
03:32 - one it's gonna work fine now back away
03:35 - now the second time i hit it
03:37 - two
03:38 - it's going to work fine
03:39 - back away now the third time i hit it my
03:42 - gates closed so let me go ahead and hit
03:43 - this
03:44 - uh
03:45 - not working i'm not getting through that
03:47 - gate and that's why my final action
03:50 - of the light turning on
03:52 - never happens
03:54 - right here so that's basically the
03:56 - beauty of a gate and again this
04:00 - basically prevents things from happening
04:02 - multiple times for example if you only
04:05 - want the user to enter a certain room
04:08 - like three times or you only want an
04:11 - enemy to spawn
04:13 - uh five times or something like that
04:15 - then this is what you would use a gate
04:18 - so i think that's all i might as well go
04:20 - over these options real quick open opens
04:23 - the gate close close the gates and
04:26 - toggle toggles that open and close and
04:28 - again the output is you know just like i
04:32 - said i can't explain it any better so
04:35 - that is a gate and in the next tutorial
04:37 - i'm probably going to be going over some
04:38 - more common actions in kismet so thank
04:40 - guys for watching don't forget to
04:42 - subscribe and don't forget to send me a
04:43 - thousand dollars on my donations button
04:45 - so thank you guys and i'll i'll see you
