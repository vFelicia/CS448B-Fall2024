00:00 - now let's try a different username so
00:02 - we'll try say Josh for example and the
00:06 - password pass one 123 pass 1 2 3 and
00:10 - click register and that's okay because
00:13 - the password or the username Josh for
00:15 - example doesn't already exist so we're
00:18 - down to the last stage of our um of our
00:22 - registration where now everything is
00:24 - okay so we just need to register the
00:27 - user one thing to note before we do so
00:29 - is we need a version of the password
00:31 - which is md5 encrypted so I'm going to
00:34 - say password um hash equals
00:40 - md5 of password Okay so we've got our
00:45 - password hash now that we can pop into
00:46 - the database that will allow our login
00:48 - system to work correctly otherwise we're
00:50 - just going to be comparing an md5 hash
00:52 - to plain data so now what we can do is
00:55 - actually start the registration
00:57 - process so um else um we need a new
01:03 - query and the new query is going to be
01:07 - query
01:08 - equals so we need to now say insert
01:14 - into
01:16 - users values and how many values have we
01:19 - got let's just go to our databas and
01:20 - check we have got let's go back to our
01:23 - table in fact let's completely refresh
01:26 - that as well so we're ready to use that
01:27 - in a minute we've got 1 2 3 4 5
01:30 - so we need 1 2 3 4 5 remember they're
01:36 - comma separated values and what we're
01:40 - doing is we need to use the MySQL real
01:42 - Escape string as well to um stop um SQL
01:47 - injection so the first one is the
01:49 - username then the password then the
01:51 - first name then the surname so um
01:57 - username password but password has
02:00 - because we're storing it as md5 data
02:02 - first name and surname but now what we
02:06 - need to do is just end that string there
02:08 - and concatenate on
02:10 - username um we can do the same with the
02:13 - password hash I
02:16 - guess end the string there and
02:18 - concatenate on first name and then
02:20 - concatenate on the rest of the
02:22 - string and then we do the same for the
02:24 - surname so end
02:26 - concatenate concatenate start okay so
02:29 - now we can enclose these in
02:31 - MySQL real Escape
02:36 - string and the same with
02:48 - this and the same with the first name
02:51 - and the last name as well so MySQL real
02:55 - Escape string
03:00 - and MySQL real real
03:05 - Escape
03:07 - string okay so now that we've done this
03:09 - this should successfully register um our
03:13 - user into the system so we need to
03:15 - perform the query first so query run is
03:18 - equal to MySQL Query and then we put the
03:22 - string data of the query inside of that
03:25 - um we're going to turn this into an if
03:26 - statement to ensure that we tell the
03:28 - user if they've been successfully
03:29 - registered or not so we can say if the
03:32 - query run equals myql query so this if
03:34 - this query there is successful then we
03:37 - can say to the user
03:39 - Echo uh successfully registered blah
03:42 - blah blah but I'm going to tell you how
03:43 - we're going to do that in a minute
03:45 - otherwise Echo sorry we couldn't
03:49 - register you at this time try again
03:55 - later so um let's just uh Escape that St
03:59 - up and that inverted comma there single
04:03 - quotation mark if you like otherwise um
04:06 - we're going to say uh we're going to
04:08 - confirm that the user is registered in
04:10 - fact we're not what we're going to do is
04:12 - we're going to locate them to a page
04:14 - that's going to tell them that they've
04:15 - successfully registered what this is
04:17 - going to do is it's going to stop them
04:18 - pressing F5 F5 on the keyboard
04:20 - refreshing the page and registering them
04:22 - again and again I know that won't work
04:24 - but it's it's a good practice to get
04:25 - into with a lot of data so header
04:30 - location and we can call the page
04:33 - something like uh
04:35 - register success. PHP okay so let's go
04:40 - ahead and create this register success.
04:42 - PHP
04:44 - file now you can bear in mind you could
04:47 - transfer over the um get variables so
04:51 - you could say U equals username password
04:54 - equals pass P equals password or
04:56 - something or just the username but I'm
04:58 - just going to tell them they're Reg for
05:00 - now in this page so
05:03 - you've
05:06 - registered um let's just uh call this
05:10 - page what do we call it um
05:13 - register success. PHP okay so that's
05:16 - going to be it for now I'll leave it up
05:17 - to you guys to you know use your
05:19 - imagination on this one um so let's test
05:22 - the process and see if we've got
05:23 - everything working so register.php I'm
05:26 - going to register a user called
05:28 - Dale password is going to be pass1 23
05:32 - password again is going to be pass1 23
05:33 - and then we're going to say Dale Garett
05:36 - we've bypass all our security up our
05:38 - validation checks now check that the
05:40 - username is there the password is uh
05:42 - matching we click register we
05:44 - transferred to this register success
05:46 - page youve registered perhaps you could
05:47 - have a link saying now you can now you
05:49 - can log in and we'll take ourselves back
05:51 - to the index.php file take a sneaking
05:55 - look inside here first and you can see
05:57 - that all the data has been processed L
06:00 - we've got ID of three now username Dale
06:02 - the password matches that because all
06:04 - the passwords are the same and we've got
06:05 - the first and last name now let's take
06:08 - Dale and password um pass one two 3 and
06:14 - click log in and you can see that we've
06:16 - successfully logged in as our new user
