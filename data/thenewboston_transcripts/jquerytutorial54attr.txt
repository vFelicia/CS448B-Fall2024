00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' no org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this tutorial we're going to look at
00:07 - the jQuery at function the way I say
00:11 - it's a bit odd I guess but it looks like
00:13 - this
00:14 - it's short for attribute I guess it's
00:16 - not really a function it's an attribute
00:18 - part of jQuery however it is used to
00:21 - take specific parts of an element
00:24 - attributes of an element and actually
00:26 - relay them or store them okay so what
00:29 - we're going to do is we're going to
00:30 - create a link and with this link we're
00:32 - going to retrieve the href and the
00:34 - target so if we were to go ahead and
00:37 - just create some paragraph tags I'm
00:40 - going to create a link inside here
00:42 - now remember href is an attribute of
00:45 - this a element and as well target is
00:49 - also an attribute so we can use jQuery
00:53 - to return the values of attributes as
00:56 - they're currently set so in this example
00:58 - we're looking at taking the attribute
01:00 - href and target which might seem pretty
01:02 - pointless but obviously you can make use
01:05 - with this on any attribute so I'm gonna
01:08 - create a link just in here and then I'm
01:11 - going to create a target as well which
01:13 - will be underscore blank which
01:15 - essentially means to open in a new
01:16 - window and then gonna give the link text
01:19 - as a link so let's go over to our
01:22 - browser and take a look you can see that
01:24 - we've just got a link here when we click
01:26 - on it we'll be taken to the URL we
01:28 - specified okay so now what I'm gonna do
01:31 - is just below this create another
01:33 - paragraph area and I'm going to call
01:36 - this I'm gonna give this an ID of ATRA
01:40 - just so we Semmy know what we're doing
01:43 - we also need to give the ID to href we
01:46 - could just we could just refer when we
01:49 - actually take the value as a we don't
01:52 - need to supply an ID however I'm just
01:54 - gonna supply an ID so we take it
01:56 - specifically from this link okay so I'm
01:59 - gonna just call this link so now that
02:01 - we've got link we want to take the
02:03 - attribute href and then later on we're
02:06 - gonna take the attribute target and
02:08 - we're gonna place it inside this
02:09 - paragraph area
02:10 - here so we need to create an external
02:13 - javascript file so let's go ahead and
02:15 - open up a new file we're gonna save this
02:17 - inside our j/s directory as atrophy is
02:21 - i'm gonna come over to index dot PHP and
02:24 - i'm going to come down and include this
02:26 - file into my page so the type is text
02:31 - forward slash JavaScript the source is
02:35 - js4 slash etre j/s okay so now that
02:40 - we've done that we need to go over to
02:42 - action is and actually take this H ref
02:44 - and place it inside this paragraph tag
02:46 - so let's go ahead and simply reference
02:50 - our link so link dot atre so we using
02:54 - the etre attribute in jQuery and we want
02:58 - to supply what attribute we want to take
03:00 - from this link so I'm gonna call that H
03:03 - ref or reference H ref so we take the H
03:05 - ref so now we need to save this inside
03:08 - of a value so we can relay it back to
03:10 - the page so I'm gonna create a variable
03:13 - and I'm gonna call this atra so now
03:16 - what's happened is this variable here
03:18 - contains this value in here so now what
03:23 - we can simply do is come down to the
03:24 - next line we can reference the paragraph
03:27 - which I have called ACTRA and I'm gonna
03:31 - say dot text etre so I'm replacing this
03:36 - variable inside are inside this text
03:41 - function which is going to take take
03:45 - this value here and actually place it
03:46 - inside of this paragraph so let's go
03:50 - over and refresh the page and you'll see
03:52 - that the link has been displayed from
03:54 - this link here so we've successfully
03:56 - taken the attribute we can then go ahead
03:59 - and perhaps change this to target save
04:02 - that out refresh our browser
04:04 - and you can see that we've got blank so
04:07 - I guess this example could be useful if
04:09 - you had for example a collection of
04:11 - links on a page and you wanted to
04:12 - display the URL next to them I guess
04:16 - this isn't a good example with the
04:18 - method or the example I've given in the
04:20 - tutorial but obviously using atra you
04:23 - can actually take attribute
04:24 - of almost any HTML element so we can go
04:28 - ahead and take attributes of divs
04:33 - attributes or form fields to get their
04:36 - value even so there's you know a sort of
04:39 - an endless supply of ways you could
04:40 - actually use this however for now that's
04:43 - the ATRA attribute in jQuery
