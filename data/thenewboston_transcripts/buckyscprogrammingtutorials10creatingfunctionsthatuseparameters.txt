00:00 - what is going on guys is bucky and
00:01 - welcome to your 10th c plus plus
00:03 - tutorial and in this tutorial i'm going
00:05 - to be teaching you guys how to create a
00:07 - function that uses parameters now a
00:09 - parameter is quite simply additional
00:12 - information that that function needs in
00:14 - order to work so let me give you guys a
00:16 - quick example of this say you made a
00:18 - function to calculate the age of someone
00:20 - how old they were well some additional
00:23 - information you would need before you
00:24 - can calculate that is what year were
00:26 - they born and once you have this
00:28 - information you can calculate their age
00:30 - so let's go ahead and now that we
00:32 - understand why a function would need
00:34 - additional information let's go ahead
00:36 - and create a simple and
00:38 - excuse me a simple function to use
00:40 - additional information so let's go ahead
00:43 - and create a function
00:44 - that just prints out bucky's favorite
00:46 - number is blank um we might say bucky's
00:49 - favorite number is 20. bucky's favorite
00:51 - number is 68 bucky's favorite number is
00:53 - 99 well since we don't know what my
00:55 - favorite number is yet we're just going
00:57 - to go ahead and put a variable in place
01:00 - for that number so since this isn't
01:02 - going to be making any calculations
01:04 - really we just go ahead and use void
01:06 - because that means return nothing so
01:09 - name your function anything you want i'm
01:11 - just going to name my print crap since
01:13 - that's all it's going to do print crap
01:14 - out on the screen and before we just
01:16 - added these empty parenthesis when
01:18 - nothing in between them and then we
01:20 - coded the body right here well whenever
01:23 - we use a parameter you actually put that
01:25 - information right in your parentheses
01:28 - and check this out
01:29 - you know how i said we didn't know what
01:31 - that number is yet and that's the
01:33 - additional information that we need well
01:35 - since we don't know what it is yet we
01:38 - just go ahead and we set it equal to a
01:39 - variable and since this is an integer
01:43 - we go ahead and see it equal to the
01:44 - variable into x
01:46 - you can name your variable anything you
01:48 - want but i'm going to name on x because
01:49 - it's really simple easy to work with
01:52 - so now we can go ahead and we can add
01:54 - the body of this function and all we're
01:56 - going to do in this function is print
01:57 - out on the screen
01:59 - bucky's
02:01 - favorite number is did i spell
02:03 - everything wrong yup yup good to go
02:06 - bucky's favorite number is x and then
02:09 - just go ahead and end that line
02:11 - and now when our function runs it's
02:13 - going to run something like this if we
02:15 - say that our favorite number is 20 it's
02:17 - going to say bucky's favorite number is
02:20 - 20. if we say that our favorite number
02:22 - is
02:23 - 10 bucky's favorite number is 10. so we
02:26 - can run this function a bunch of times
02:28 - and give a different piece of
02:29 - information each time and it's gonna
02:31 - work so let's go ahead and remember in
02:35 - order to use a function in your main you
02:38 - just go ahead and you type the function
02:39 - name
02:41 - and then you add your parentheses and
02:43 - your semicolon at the end
02:45 - but whenever your function needs an
02:47 - additional piece of information you need
02:49 - to give it that information inside the
02:51 - parentheses so we know for making our
02:54 - function that it needs one integer in
02:57 - order to work so let's go ahead and in
02:59 - inside these parenthesis give it one
03:01 - integer
03:02 - 20. so now what it's going to do is well
03:05 - let me go ahead and run this and show it
03:07 - to you guys
03:08 - bucky's favorite number is 20 all right
03:12 - so what happened is this we said all
03:15 - right c plus program we want to use this
03:18 - print craft method well it said all
03:20 - right in order to use this method i'm
03:22 - going to need one integer so we gave it
03:25 - the integer 20. so then whenever in this
03:28 - function it came across the variable x
03:30 - it just substituted 20 for that
03:33 - so
03:34 - whenever you're making parameters you
03:36 - first need to list what type of data and
03:38 - also a variable name so then whenever we
03:42 - give it that variable it substitute that
03:44 - variable for x later on in the program
03:48 - so for example let's give it one more
03:50 - example like 854. well now we run it and
03:54 - it says
03:55 - bucky's favorite number is 854
03:58 - and that's the beauty of parameters and
04:01 - functions it doesn't need to be the same
04:03 - every time so that's why you can use
04:05 - variables so again what we did is we
04:08 - created a function
04:09 - and it needed an additional piece of
04:12 - information which was an integer and
04:14 - since it didn't know the value yet it
04:16 - just went ahead and set it equal to a
04:18 - variable then later on in the body
04:21 - whenever it came across that variable it
04:23 - knew whatever value you told it to
04:26 - substitute for x that's what value is
04:28 - substituted for x so we can run this 100
04:31 - times with a hundred different values if
04:33 - we want it's going to substitute it for
04:35 - x each time and use that information to
04:37 - plug it in
04:39 - so that's the basics of how you use
04:41 - functions with parameter again
04:44 - whenever you're creating a parameter use
04:46 - the data type and a variable name and
04:48 - whenever you're using the function don't
04:50 - forget to pass in or give it whatever
04:53 - information it needs so that's pretty
04:55 - cool simple enough we understand that
04:57 - but in the next tutorial what i'm going
04:59 - to be teaching guys is how to use
05:01 - function that use multiple parameters
05:04 - what if a function needs more than one
05:06 - piece of information in order to work
05:08 - well i'm going to show you guys how to
05:10 - do that too and it's a little different
05:12 - than this so you definitely want to
05:13 - watch that so once you understand this
05:15 - and understand the basics behind
05:17 - functions and parameters you're ready to
05:20 - move on to the next tutorial so thank
05:21 - you guys for watching don't forget
05:23 - subscribe and i'll see you guys in the
05:24 - next video
