00:01 - hello YouTube Sam from youtube.com slash
00:04 - on life gamer here for the New Boston
00:06 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:08 - talking about errors now you can see
00:10 - here that I have the project we had open
00:11 - in the last tutorial so in Visual Basic
00:15 - and I loved mostly all other programming
00:17 - languages you've got three types of
00:19 - errors you got syntax errors you've got
00:23 - your runtime errors and you've got your
00:25 - logic errors now I'll take you through
00:28 - these three types of errors and then
00:30 - I'll show you how to use the error list
00:32 - down here
00:33 - with errors warnings and messages so up
00:36 - here we have a program and since we
00:39 - typed out all the code correctly if we
00:41 - run it it's going to open up and run
00:43 - perfectly fine it's going to print out
00:45 - hello world this is an example of a
00:48 - program that has no errors in it now
00:51 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
00:52 - create an error now this error is going
00:54 - to be a syntax error so you can see that
00:56 - when I type when I remove this
00:59 - parenthesis here it gives us an error
01:01 - down here in the error list it tells us
01:04 - expression expected it tells us the file
01:07 - that it's in so over here in our
01:09 - solution Explorer we've got our comments
01:11 - project got my project which which holds
01:14 - all the settings and stuff for it and
01:16 - we've got our file module one dot V B
01:18 - now in projects you can have a whole
01:20 - bunch of files you can have a bunch of
01:21 - modules and a bunch of classes or forms
01:24 - and other stuff so this is very useful
01:28 - when you're making bigger programs
01:29 - because it will let you know which file
01:31 - it's in it also lets you know which line
01:33 - it is and that is why we cheat we show
01:36 - the lines by coming up here and going to
01:38 - tools options text editor general or all
01:44 - languages and click checked line numbers
01:48 - now we did that so that whenever we get
01:50 - errors we can see the line number that's
01:52 - in here come over to our file and we can
01:55 - come down here to line number five where
01:57 - it is and column 26 now column 26 just
02:00 - means that it is 16 spaces over from the
02:04 - left right here and you can see that
02:07 - whenever you have a syntax error it's
02:09 - got a little squiggly line under it just
02:12 - to let you know where it is
02:13 - now if we go ahead and try to run this
02:15 - it won't run it will say that there were
02:17 - build errors and if we go ahead and fix
02:20 - this it should run perfectly fine it
02:23 - says hello world right there and now
02:27 - let's go ahead and talk a little bit
02:29 - about runtime errors now I can't show
02:31 - you an example of a runtime error in a
02:33 - simple program like this but I'll try to
02:35 - explain it to you as best I can
02:36 - now let's say you're making a like an
02:41 - FTP downloader which is what we're going
02:43 - to make later on close to the end of the
02:45 - tutorials once we've covered everything
02:47 - I'm going to teach you how to build
02:48 - specific programs I'm going to take you
02:50 - to the steps I used to build those so
02:53 - let's say we're creating an FTP
02:54 - downloader and we want to open a file to
02:57 - upload to the FTP server so we try to
03:02 - open a file and it works fine and then
03:04 - once we try to upload it to the server
03:05 - it's going to give us an error because
03:07 - let's say the user doesn't have access
03:08 - to that now because the user doesn't
03:12 - have write permissions when they try to
03:14 - upload it it's going to give them an
03:15 - error and the program is going to freeze
03:17 - up it's going to stop working and you'll
03:19 - have to force close it so basically what
03:22 - you would need to do to handle this is
03:24 - to go ahead and enclose all of that code
03:30 - in what's called a try-catch statement
03:31 - now what this does is it tries a block
03:34 - of code and catches any errors that are
03:36 - thrown and then once it catches those it
03:38 - decides what's to do with them now all
03:41 - the programs that we're going to be
03:42 - writing or at least most of them up
03:43 - until it close to the end we're not
03:45 - going to need a try-catch statement so
03:47 - we'll be learning that later on so
03:50 - that's pretty much what a runtime error
03:52 - is now I'll tell you what a logic error
03:56 - is a logic error is something that
04:00 - mostly every programmer hates what it
04:03 - means is that your program compiles fine
04:05 - it runs fine but then the results or the
04:09 - outcome that you get from using your
04:10 - program is not what you expected so
04:14 - let's do an example of a logic error
04:17 - this will be a really simple logic error
04:19 - so let's say I forget to do console dot
04:21 - readline and when I run this it just
04:24 - flashes and close
04:25 - really quick so that's just a basic
04:30 - logic error but an example of a major
04:35 - logic error would be let's say somebody
04:37 - makes a calculator and they build all
04:39 - these classes for it and then once they
04:41 - go in the calculator and try to use it
04:43 - the calculations are wrong and that
04:45 - makes it really hard because it doesn't
04:47 - tell you where the errors are because
04:48 - they're technically that isn't an error
04:50 - it's just an error in what you did and
04:52 - the outcome is not what you expected so
04:56 - data now that I've covered the three
04:59 - types of errors we're going to come down
05:01 - here and take a closer look at the error
05:03 - list now you can see that we have zero
05:05 - errors and zero warnings now what a
05:08 - warning is is it's pretty much the
05:10 - compiler trying to protect you from
05:13 - errors possibly happening when you run
05:15 - your code so let's say you may not
05:17 - understand this let's say you create a
05:19 - variable and the variable is null and
05:23 - you try to do something but then the
05:25 - variable is never signed then you try to
05:28 - call that variable you're going to get
05:29 - an O and you're going to get an error
05:31 - from that so always always look at your
05:35 - warnings don't ignore them and under
05:38 - messages it just gives you possible
05:40 - things that you may want to okay so now
05:43 - that you've taken a look at some of the
05:45 - errors and the error types you can get
05:47 - and you've looked at the error list and
05:49 - how to find those errors and fix them go
05:52 - ahead and just play around that a little
05:55 - bit more maybe watch this again just to
05:57 - get that stuck into your head and once
05:59 - you're done with that go ahead and move
06:00 - on to the next tutorial and don't forget
