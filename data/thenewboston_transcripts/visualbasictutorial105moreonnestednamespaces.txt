00:00 - hello YouTube say I'm here from
00:02 - youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
00:04 - new Boston and in this tutorial we're
00:07 - gonna be taking a look at nests and
00:09 - namespaces again but instead of doing
00:12 - them like we did in the last tutorial
00:14 - we're gonna look at a better and easier
00:17 - to understand way so we'll go ahead and
00:20 - just delete this code right here and
00:25 - we'll delete this too now let's come
00:28 - back into our people dot VB file you can
00:33 - see that we have namespace all people
00:35 - other people and friends all nested
00:39 - inside of all people now there is an
00:42 - easier way to do this so what we can do
00:46 - is let's go ahead and take out this
00:48 - right here and we'll come back up to the
00:53 - top and here is our namespace people
01:03 - okay so now I have names tastes people
01:05 - and other people and friends now what we
01:09 - can do is we could take functions or we
01:14 - could take classes I mean and put them
01:16 - inside of all people and allow all of
01:18 - the other classes inside of other people
01:20 - and friends doing what's called inherit
01:23 - those classes from the all people now
01:27 - we'll be talking about inheritance and
01:29 - probably a couple of tutorials from now
01:30 - so let's go ahead and make some changes
01:34 - to this code so you guys know what I'm
01:37 - talking about about nesting the the
01:41 - namespaces so you see here we have name
01:43 - States all people and other people know
01:46 - what we want to do to nest this is type
01:48 - namespace all people dot other people
01:53 - and then we'll go ahead and do it again
01:56 - right here so now this namespace right
02:01 - here is pretty much part of the all
02:05 - people namespace so whatever classes are
02:10 - put inside of this these classes can
02:12 - inherit from those too and now this
02:15 - probably confuses you the tournament
02:16 - heritance but we'll be talking about
02:18 - that soon and after we've done that you
02:20 - can come back to this and use
02:22 - inheritance to make this code a little
02:24 - bit easier to work with and understand
02:27 - okay so now we have all people without
02:31 - friends and all people to other people
02:32 - so we can come in here and let's just
02:35 - create an other people object so private
02:40 - my person as new and then we're gonna
02:44 - type all people dot other people dot
02:50 - people so we've created an object of the
02:54 - people class from other people which is
02:56 - right here and it has nothing to do with
02:59 - this people class down here in friends
03:04 - so let's come in here and we will access
03:08 - the button one click so we'll type my
03:11 - person dot first-name equals
03:15 - texe first name dot txt my person dot
03:18 - last name equals text last name dot text
03:22 - and they'll go ahead show that out so
03:26 - message box my person dot - string and
03:32 - we'll go ahead and run this so we can
03:37 - type the first name tomm last name let's
03:43 - just say let's just do Harris again okay
03:48 - so we'll go ahead and click show person
03:50 - and you can see that we get Tom Harris
03:53 - right here in the title is name spaces
03:55 - so we'll just go ahead and click OK
03:57 - so go ahead and practice a little bit
04:00 - more with nesting namespaces so that you
04:05 - can organize your classes better and I
04:08 - would recommend using this type of
04:10 - nesting namespaces over just putting
04:13 - them inside of each other because that
04:14 - could get a little confusing and when
04:16 - you use this it makes it a lot easier to
04:18 - understand so go ahead and practice that
04:21 - a bit and then once we've got that down
04:22 - move on to the next tutorial
