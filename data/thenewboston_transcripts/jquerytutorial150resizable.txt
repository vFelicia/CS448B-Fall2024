00:00 - but we're going to be taking a look at
00:01 - the maximum and minimum widths and
00:03 - Heights a bit later on anyway okay so
00:05 - for the rest of the options I'm going to
00:09 - remove the bigger box just so we can see
00:11 - everything a bit better so I'm going to
00:13 - get rid of the bigger box from here and
00:17 - now again we're just left with the
00:18 - smaller box that we can still resize so
00:21 - let's go ahead and take a look at some
00:23 - of the other options that we can define
00:25 - in here now the first one we're going to
00:27 - look at is animate and we can set this
00:29 - to either true or false by default it's
00:32 - false so what's going to happen here is
00:34 - when we drag we don't actually see the
00:36 - drag happen but when we release it
00:38 - resizes to the size that you've defined
00:41 - now there is a problem here that you
00:43 - can't actually see where you're dragging
00:45 - to so I could you know drag over here
00:47 - and it will animate nicely but we can't
00:50 - actually see where we are actually
00:52 - dragging it to before it animates so to
00:55 - fix this we use the ghost option and by
00:58 - default this is set to false but now
01:00 - we're going to set it to true will
01:01 - actually see a lower opacity version of
01:06 - the div that you are or the element that
01:08 - you are resizing before the animation
01:10 - happens so you can see that at the
01:12 - moment I'm dragging that there you can
01:14 - see the opacity set much lower and then
01:18 - that will resize to a particular area so
01:22 - you can see the ghost of the div or the
01:24 - element before you actually decide to
01:27 - drag it or before the user actually
01:30 - drags it with regards to the animation
01:34 - we can set a few different properties
01:36 - here so for example we could set animate
01:40 - duration and this just is the speed of
01:44 - the animation in milliseconds we can
01:46 - also specify things like slow medium and
01:49 - fast or sorry not medium normal and fast
01:54 - so for example if we were to set the
01:56 - animation duration to slow when we go
01:59 - ahead and resize it its well that's
02:02 - that's classed as slow if we were to go
02:05 - ahead and change this to fast you can
02:08 - see that you have a much faster effect
02:10 - when it resizes so it's quite quicker
02:12 - or you can go ahead like I said and
02:14 - define this in milliseconds
02:16 - so we could say 50 for example which
02:18 - would be extremely quick and when we
02:20 - resize it almost snaps to it so
02:22 - depending on what kind of effect you're
02:24 - looking for you can do this obviously if
02:27 - we work out something like three seconds
02:29 - which is 3,000 milliseconds you can see
02:31 - it you know slides a lot quicker at
02:34 - slower sorry and with regards to
02:37 - animation as well we can use animation
02:39 - easing techniques so we can also define
02:42 - anim animate easing and you can set it
02:49 - to by default it's set to swing but you
02:52 - can set it to linear so let's just check
02:54 - out swing that's the default option you
02:58 - can see particularly when it's very slow
02:59 - that as it gets towards the end it slows
03:01 - down so it's almost like a graph that
03:04 - starts low so when the animation starts
03:07 - it starts slowly it speeds up and then
03:10 - it slows down again this is the swing
03:13 - animation easing effect if we were to
03:15 - use linear it will resize exactly the
03:18 - same speed every time you can see then
03:21 - it just stops so depending on again the
03:24 - how you want it to look this will just
03:26 - slide at a constant pace as opposed to
03:30 - swing so I'm just going to remove this
03:32 - animation duration and remove this
03:35 - animate easing so we can see some other
03:38 - options now another useful option is the
03:41 - aspect ratio if you'll try to maintain a
03:44 - particular aspect ratio you can go ahead
03:47 - and turn this on so for example if I was
03:50 - just to say true what will happen now is
03:54 - I can't resize out of the actual aspect
03:57 - ratio the original aspect ratio of the
04:00 - object or the element so now that I've
04:02 - set this to true I can't actually move
04:05 - it for example I can't resize from the
04:07 - sides the aspect ratio is maintained
04:10 - however with the aspect ratio you can
04:12 - also predefined an aspect ratio that you
04:15 - want it to adhere to so for example you
04:18 - could do this in
04:19 - in a point something form so for example
04:24 - 0.40 this would just keep it in this
04:27 - aspect ratio here and then now that
04:29 - object is bound to that particular
04:31 - aspect ratio you can also define a
04:35 - fraction for example 2 over 5 or 2 by 5
04:40 - and this would also allow you to do this
04:42 - so for example you could do 9/10 and
04:46 - then this would keep a 9/10 aspect ratio
04:49 - so it's 9 width and 10 height so that's
04:51 - the aspect ratio just keeping it to true
04:54 - though will maintain the initial aspect
04:58 - ratio that it holds so let's go ahead
05:00 - and get rid of that okay so back on is
05:04 - more a more aesthetic option we're going
05:08 - to go ahead and enable auto hide now
05:11 - what auto hide does is it hides the tiny
05:13 - triangle that you can see in the corner
05:15 - of this div until the mouse is hovered
05:18 - over the element in which you are
05:20 - reciting so if we were to set auto hide
05:22 - to true and we refresh you can see that
05:25 - the triangle has actually disappeared
05:27 - however when I hover my mouse over this
05:29 - particular element the small triangle
05:32 - appears again so I can now go ahead and
05:34 - resize this so that's quite useful if
05:37 - you don't want to show this on let's say
05:41 - you had a lot of resizable objects you
05:43 - don't want to show this on every single
05:44 - object and if it's obvious that a
05:47 - particular element can be resized you
05:49 - might not want to show this however be
05:51 - careful because if you don't show this
05:53 - initially it does just look like a grey
05:55 - box the small triangle in the corner
05:58 - often represents something that can be
06:00 - resized so it's entirely up to you on
06:02 - whether you were to keep it there I like
06:05 - to keep also hide off generally but
06:08 - again if you had lots of elements that
06:11 - are able to be resized it tends to look
06:14 - better when you enable auto hide okay so
06:18 - another thing we can do is we can
06:20 - specify a grid now we saw this in the
06:23 - draggable interaction in the jQuery UI
06:25 - as well and with the grid we can specify
06:28 - a numerical value with l2 numerical
06:31 - value
06:31 - within square brackets that represent a
06:35 - grid that the element will snap to
