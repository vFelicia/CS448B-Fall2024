00:00 - hello this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:03 - and this is a video tutorial for the new
00:06 - Boston now in this video we're going to
00:08 - be looking at our PHP ini file now ini
00:12 - ini files or any files whatever you
00:14 - decide to however you slide to pronounce
00:16 - them I say I and I just because I'm
00:18 - being literal and saying each character
00:23 - it's basically a configuration file so
00:25 - you know that as soon as we see the file
00:28 - PHP dot ini we automatically know that
00:31 - this is a PHP configuration file now
00:34 - what is our configuration file our PHP
00:36 - configuration file and where can we find
00:38 - it now I've opened my text editor here
00:40 - so I can open this file and we can have
00:42 - a look through at some of the features
00:44 - inside it and how we can change things
00:47 - about our PHP installation so you can
00:50 - have a good look at this maybe print it
00:51 - out take it around with you look at
00:53 - different things because it's really
00:54 - useful to get to know inside of your PHP
00:57 - dot ini file because a lot of PHP
01:00 - problems that you later realize when
01:02 - you're coding actually come down to the
01:04 - settings in your PHP dot ini file so
01:07 - let's create an open dialog well open up
01:09 - an open dialog now you can see that at
01:11 - the moment I'm in C colon backslash
01:13 - xampp backslash PHP now this is because
01:16 - I have I'm running an xampp package you
01:19 - can see here I've got my xampp control
01:20 - panel open and I've got Apache my sequel
01:23 - running blah blah this is just my this
01:27 - is just my package that I've installed
01:29 - that contains Apache along with PHP
01:32 - installed with Apache so this is our
01:35 - folder with PHP and it's got all the
01:36 - information and the runtime dll's about
01:42 - with regards to our PHP installation
01:44 - now obviously the file we want is let's
01:47 - just find it it would be here is PHP to
01:50 - ienai so this is the typical location
01:53 - depending on whether you've installed
01:54 - PHP yourself if you've installed Apache
01:57 - and PHP yourself or if you're using a
01:59 - package such as xampp alarm some of the
02:03 - others ones we've got W amp I think so
02:05 - let's go ahead and just open up our PHP
02:07 - to ini now obviously if you are having
02:09 - trouble finding this you can just do a
02:11 - local search on your computer just make
02:13 - sure it looks like it
02:14 - in a sort of relative location to your
02:17 - local webserver okay so when we open up
02:21 - this file you notice that we have a
02:22 - warning and a bit about PHP dot ini now
02:25 - this is very important by default PHP
02:27 - installs itself with the configuration
02:28 - suitable for development purposes and
02:31 - not for production purposes now what
02:36 - this means is the PHP the default
02:37 - installation PHP ini is not suitable for
02:41 - when you were just if you were to say
02:43 - okay so I've got a local webserver on my
02:46 - on my computer here's my IP address you
02:49 - can see what pages I'm running always
02:51 - always always when you want to show
02:53 - people or release PHP files or a project
02:56 - that you've created always upload it to
02:58 - a paid hosting or a free hosting but
03:01 - some kind of commercial hosting website
03:03 - because what you don't want is you don't
03:05 - want to have the in experience of not
03:07 - setting this file up properly and you
03:09 - suffering for that so there's lots of
03:11 - security aspects that when we enable
03:14 - settings and disable settings in this
03:16 - PHP dot ini file we tend to find that
03:19 - we're allowing ourselves from ability so
03:22 - we can go down you can see standard
03:24 - syntax in here is that we've got the
03:26 - semicolon as a as an end of a line so
03:30 - well as a comment in in this purpose you
03:33 - can see that we've got loads of set
03:35 - semicolons here that are basically just
03:37 - commenting this out so this won't be
03:39 - processed by by PHP so let's go down and
03:43 - find a setting okay so you can see that
03:46 - things like engine on is not commented
03:49 - out so these are file these are settings
03:51 - that are currently in use then that you
03:52 - can modify so let's go down and find
03:55 - something that we might change okay so
03:59 - you've got things like Zed libbed or
04:00 - output compression off you've got a
04:02 - quite a descriptive description up here
04:05 - quite an extensive description of what
04:06 - it does as with you do with most
04:08 - settings you'll find that a lot of this
04:10 - file is is actually description so we're
04:16 - not going to change any settings now
04:17 - we'll leave that to later when we need
04:19 - to we're going to talk about things like
04:21 - error handling and how we can change
04:22 - this inside our PHP dot ini file just
04:26 - one more note
04:27 - is when you make a modification to PHP
04:30 - dot ini if you were to say print this
04:33 - out and go through a reader and you
04:35 - might get to a stage in your programming
04:37 - where you know that you want to change a
04:39 - value now once you've changed a value
04:41 - and you've saved the file so you go to
04:42 - file and save that's absolutely fine
04:45 - however what you need to do is you need
04:46 - to either restart Apache manually or you
04:50 - need to bring up your exam or similar
04:53 - control panel and stop this service
04:55 - before you restart it so for example if
04:58 - I was to change something in here so I'd
04:59 - be able to change this value for any
05:01 - reason I can then oh I should then sorry
05:03 - I open up my exam or other control panel
05:06 - and I stop the service simply stop the
05:09 - service again okay so the service isn't
05:12 - the service is now stopped we can click
05:14 - start again wait till that starts back
05:16 - up and it's running again now what we've
05:18 - done is PHP has taken into account the
05:20 - changes that you've made and will now
05:22 - process them according to what you've
05:23 - written so my strong recommendation will
05:26 - be to have a look through this see if
05:28 - anything catches your eye get to know
05:30 - different values and what they do and
05:32 - read some of the descriptions if you
05:34 - have time because it's a really really
05:36 - useful file to know what you're doing
05:37 - with a lot of PHP problems that crop up
05:40 - like I said are to do with files or to
05:43 - do the values in this either being
05:45 - disabled or enabled or switch to
05:47 - something that not allowing a certain
05:50 - piece of code that you're using or sort
05:51 - of method you're using on your website
05:53 - or code not to work so PHP dot ini files
05:56 - basically the PHP configuration file for
05:58 - PHP have a browse around it and
06:02 - hopefully it will be of some use to you
06:04 - in the future
