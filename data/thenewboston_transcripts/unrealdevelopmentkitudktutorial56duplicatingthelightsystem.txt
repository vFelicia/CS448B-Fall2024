00:00 - alright guys welcome to your 56 the UDK
00:02 - tutorial and check it out we already
00:05 - have a pretty cool level where we can go
00:07 - ahead and go up to the light and shoot
00:10 - it out and it looks like it blows it out
00:11 - but what if we wanted to build a big
00:14 - level and have a bunch of these lights
00:15 - well let's go ahead and figure that out
00:18 - right now so the very first thing that
00:19 - we could do is I'm actually going to be
00:22 - putting more lights on this wall so I'm
00:23 - going to go ahead and expand this wall a
00:26 - little bit by X I'm just scroll out and
00:29 - move it over a little bit looking pretty
00:32 - good so now what I'm going to be doing
00:34 - is I'm going to be duplicating these
00:36 - lights so I'm going to be you know
00:39 - selecting all of these things and I
00:41 - don't want this wall to get in the way
00:42 - so if i go ahead and select this wall
00:44 - and hit this button hide selected it's
00:47 - going to hide out my wall and it's going
00:48 - to allow me to select these things a
00:50 - little bit easier so now i can go ahead
00:52 - in my side view and hold ctrl alt and
00:54 - select all that crap right there and if
00:57 - i hold alt in drag it's going to be able
01:00 - to duplicate them a whole lot easier
01:02 - without selecting that wall so now
01:05 - actually what i can do is go ahead and
01:07 - press this button show all and it can
01:09 - bring my wall back because I just didn't
01:11 - want to accidentally select my wall
01:12 - whenever I was duplicating that so now
01:15 - you're saying all right you do paid your
01:18 - light should be good to go so let's go
01:19 - ahead and test this out hit play from
01:21 - here run up to this one perfect shot
01:24 - that out run up this one hmm doesn't
01:28 - seem Lee we work in here so what exactly
01:30 - is the problem well the thing is
01:32 - whenever you duplicate objects using
01:35 - that technique it duplicates the objects
01:38 - in the perspective view but it doesn't
01:41 - duplicate the kismet see for example we
01:44 - only have this first lights system set
01:47 - up so we need to go ahead and change
01:49 - that right now so go ahead and hit ctrl
01:51 - alt and select your entire lighting
01:54 - system so now what you want to do is
01:56 - hold ctrl C to cut and V to paste and
02:00 - now you can just go ahead and move that
02:02 - over it actually is pretty good if you
02:05 - move keep this one on the left and this
02:07 - one on the right since then you can tell
02:09 - what while use on your left and what
02:10 - light is on your right however check
02:12 - this out right now
02:13 - if you look at the event it says enter
02:16 - back through 10 enter Pachter 10 all
02:18 - right this is 10 this is 10 so this
02:22 - isn't a system that's set up for this
02:24 - light right here these are pretty much
02:26 - as to kismet systems and they're both
02:28 - set up referring to this light right
02:31 - here so we go ahead and play our level
02:34 - whenever you shoot our light okay it
02:40 - doesn't seem to be really working so
02:42 - let's go ahead and fix that the first
02:44 - thing I want to do is rebuild my
02:45 - lighting because it is just annoying me
02:48 - and let me think of a cool story to tell
02:51 - you guys that take up five seconds I'm
02:53 - sorry I got nothing so yeah I'm just
02:57 - going to wait here awkward that was
02:59 - awkward so now let me go ahead and
03:02 - rebuild the system so the very first
03:05 - thing we want to do is we already have
03:07 - this kismet setup now let's go ahead and
03:09 - change this so let me go ahead and
03:12 - select this and as you notice this is
03:14 - the bus that out light right here that
03:16 - we're selecting so go ahead and select
03:18 - your busted light and open kids met and
03:20 - here is a system to the right that we
03:22 - want to alter so the very first thing we
03:25 - want to do is actually it's probably
03:27 - easier to do this go ahead and select
03:29 - your busted light and hit hide this now
03:32 - whenever we high that the glowing light
03:34 - is going to show so if we go ahead and
03:35 - select that glowing light which is the
03:37 - first light the light that takes the
03:39 - damage we can go ahead and right-click
03:41 - this event right here and we want to
03:44 - assign interp actor to two events now
03:47 - check it out instead of interp actor ten
03:51 - taking damage now this inter bacter to
03:55 - which is this one takes the damage so
03:58 - basically with that light selected we
04:01 - also want to go over here to the lit up
04:03 - light and right click it and put a sign
04:06 - enter pachter 22 object variables so
04:09 - basically what we're doing is this
04:12 - system over here references this light
04:15 - over here and we're changing this system
04:18 - over here to reference this stuff over
04:20 - here so now what we want to do is I
04:22 - guess we can go ahead and select our
04:24 - spotlight in our perspective view
04:26 - and in kismet right click and hit a sign
04:29 - spotlight talkable 22 this variable and
04:31 - the last thing we want to do is we want
04:34 - to assign that busted light to this
04:36 - system so if we go ahead and show all
04:38 - again we get our busted light back so
04:40 - now select your busted light right click
04:42 - it and hit assign busted light to this
04:45 - object so now we have two custom systems
04:48 - the first system right here is referring
04:51 - to this first light over here and now
04:53 - the second system right here is
04:56 - referring to this entire system right
04:59 - here what's the light spotlight and all
05:01 - so now let me go ahead and scroll out of
05:04 - that and now I'll go ahead and right
05:07 - click and play from here and we'll see
05:09 - how it works so our first system
05:11 - whenever we shoot it it shuts off
05:13 - perfectly it doesn't affect this system
05:15 - at all and now this system whenever we
05:17 - shoot it it shuts off perfectly and
05:20 - everything is working beautifully so I
05:23 - just want to go over a couple points um
05:25 - before I let you guys go first of all
05:27 - whenever you copy objects that have
05:30 - kismet applied to them it only copies
05:33 - the visible object it doesn't copy the
05:35 - coding or the kismet behind the scenes
05:38 - and also whenever you want to assign a
05:41 - new variable to pretty much the same
05:44 - system pretty much to replace an object
05:46 - in the system I need to do is select the
05:48 - object in your perspective view right
05:51 - click it and assign it a new object or a
05:53 - new event so it's as easy as that so if
05:56 - you guys are just trying to you know
05:57 - copy your system and it wasn't working
05:59 - then that was probably why so that's all
