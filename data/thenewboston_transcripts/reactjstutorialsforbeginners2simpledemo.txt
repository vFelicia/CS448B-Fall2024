00:00 - all righty hostes welcome back and in
00:02 - this video now that we have everything
00:04 - set up I want to go ahead and show you
00:06 - guys a really basic example and the most
00:09 - basic example I can think of is just
00:11 - displaying some text on the screen so
00:13 - this is going to be the dumbest react
00:15 - project ever but we'll get the basics
00:18 - out of the way taken care of so the way
00:21 - that this is going to work is whenever
00:23 - you make something in react whenever you
00:25 - make a website or an application you're
00:27 - going to use react to essentially
00:29 - generate some HTML now usually this is
00:32 - going to be generated by you know doing
00:34 - something fancy like connecting to a
00:35 - database or some API um like getting a
00:39 - list of users and then generating
00:40 - everyone's profile picture or username
00:43 - or something but for now what we're
00:46 - going to do is we're just going to throw
00:48 - some you know like a heading one or
00:49 - heading two in there and essentially
00:52 - whenever it generates this HTML we need
00:55 - somewhere to stick it so we're going to
00:57 - say all right this is the code we're
00:58 - generating with react where are we going
01:00 - to put it on our website so I'm going to
01:04 - go ahead and make a div and by the way
01:06 - if you're using a JY Rin if you just
01:08 - write div or any tag name and hit tab
01:10 - then it's kind of a shortcut fills the
01:12 - rest out for you so I'm just going to go
01:14 - ahead and give this an ID of example and
01:17 - all this is is it's basically a target
01:21 - for later on whenever we write our react
01:24 - down here it's going to generate a bunch
01:26 - of HTML and we're going to say just
01:27 - stick it inside example so it's pretty
01:29 - much
01:30 - container um you know just normal HTML
01:34 - so now we can actually start writing our
01:36 - react code so I'm going to go ahead and
01:39 - make a script tag Now by default this is
01:42 - just normal JavaScript that's what the
01:44 - browser is going to see but remember I
01:46 - said that we aren't going to write plain
01:48 - old vanilla JavaScript what we are going
01:51 - to do is we're actually going to bew
01:52 - writing something called jsx it's a
01:55 - special type of JavaScript that allows
01:57 - us to use HTML syntax in it and it makes
01:59 - it really really easy to program so what
02:02 - we actually need to do is we need to add
02:04 - an attribute right here and say text
02:07 - Babel and if I say Babel sometimes
02:10 - that's actually because there's a kid in
02:11 - my class named Andy Babel and before I
02:15 - learn Babble um I don't know that's kind
02:17 - of what I see in here so again if I say
02:20 - Babel it's actually Babble but anyways
02:23 - inside here what's going to happen is
02:25 - we're going to type jsx and since we
02:27 - have this script this is actually the um
02:32 - Babel transpiler it's basically a
02:34 - translator that's going to take anything
02:35 - in between here and translate it to
02:37 - normal JavaScript so our browser doesn't
02:40 - freak out all right guys so for this
02:42 - example I'm going to be showing you guys
02:44 - one line of code and we'll just go ahead
02:45 - and run this and make sure that
02:46 - everything is working properly so from
02:49 - react Dom call one method called render
02:54 - now eventually whenever I talk to you
02:56 - guys about components which are
02:57 - essentially just part of your website
02:59 - then this is really how you use the
03:02 - render method but for right now I'll
03:04 - explain it like this basically what
03:06 - render does is it takes a bit of HTML
03:09 - and it throws it into a Target in other
03:12 - words wherever you want to display it
03:14 - now since we really only have one place
03:18 - where we can Target we'll just go ahead
03:20 - and use this as a Target so the first
03:23 - parameter again like I said is just some
03:25 - HTML so this can be whatever you know
03:28 - single tag that you want just going to
03:30 - go ahead and make a heading
03:32 - one and I'm going to go ahead and close
03:35 - it and in between here I'll just write
03:38 - uh
03:39 - hi my name is
03:41 - [Music]
03:42 - Bucky just like that actually let me
03:45 - just write
03:46 - Bucky make sure I'm not running out of
03:48 - room so this is our HTML and right now
03:51 - this is basically our react component if
03:54 - you don't know what a component is don't
03:55 - worry about it yet so the next parameter
03:57 - and the only other one it takes is where
04:00 - are we going to display this well we
04:02 - need to say um this div right up here so
04:06 - how do we do that well if you just wrate
04:09 - document
04:11 - dog
04:13 - Elements by ID it allows us to throw in
04:16 - the
04:17 - ID of an element which is
04:22 - example and it's going to go ahead and
04:24 - return a reference to this element right
04:26 - here so all we're doing is we're saying
04:28 - all right take this code which is a
04:30 - simple heading and throw into this div
04:34 - right there so now if I refresh this
04:36 - page check it out now if I look at my
04:39 - source code I don't know if you guys can
04:40 - see this it might be a little bit small
04:42 - but we basically have our heading one
04:44 - thrown right up into here and of course
04:47 - we can change this to a heading two and
04:50 - we can write like bacon or whatever we
04:51 - want and it's going to take whatever
04:53 - this code is and it's going to stick it
04:56 - right in between our Target as we can
04:58 - see right there so that's the very
05:00 - basics of react now again if we didn't
05:04 - include this line of code right here
05:07 - then watch what happens whenever you try
05:08 - to run this actually let me print out my
05:10 - console it's going to say whoa whoa whoa
05:12 - what the heck is this you see it's
05:14 - freaking out because this isn't actually
05:17 - JavaScript this is jsx and again it's
05:20 - just a lot easier whenever we can write
05:23 - HTML in our JavaScript so that's why we
05:25 - need to include this to translate it to
05:27 - regular JavaScript so yeah there you go
05:30 - thank you guys for watching I'll see you
05:31 - guys in the next video
