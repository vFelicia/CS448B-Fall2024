00:00 - this is Alex one PHP academy' dog with
00:02 - another video for the new Boston this
00:04 - time we're going to be talking about
00:05 - do-while loops now we've looked at wire
00:08 - loops and this is the previous example
00:10 - that I showed it basically counts from
00:12 - one to ten and displays hello for each
00:14 - increment or each time the block is
00:17 - executed now a do-while loop is quite an
00:20 - is it's very similar except it has one
00:23 - minor difference and that is that we
00:25 - don't check the condition if the
00:27 - condition is true or false we don't
00:29 - evaluate a condition at the star we
00:31 - evaluate it at the end so the do-while
00:33 - loop will always run the block once if
00:36 - this isn't making sense I'll show you
00:38 - it's do-while then the condition so we
00:43 - always execute at least once in here
00:46 - before we test for condition so for an
00:51 - example let's echo this will always show
00:57 - okay so while zero okay so do while zero
01:04 - remember in the last example when we did
01:07 - the while loop I put zero in and nothing
01:08 - happened because we evaluated it to
01:11 - false therefore the block here didn't
01:14 - run now do we're going to echo this then
01:17 - we're going to make an evaluation and if
01:20 - this this equals false the second time
01:22 - round we're not going to echo this out
01:24 - so we can forget about counter for now
01:26 - that's irrelevant let's refresh and you
01:29 - can see this will always show because it
01:32 - will always show however if we wanted
01:36 - this to display three times for example
01:39 - and we reset up our counter we can do it
01:44 - ten times so let's break and we can
01:47 - change this to one this will always show
01:49 - once so despite what our while thing is
01:54 - this will always show once now let's
01:57 - create a condition so while counter is
02:00 - smaller than or equal to ten under here
02:03 - we're going to say counter plus plus so
02:08 - doing exactly the same thing as we did
02:09 - with the while loop but while counter is
02:11 - smaller than you equal to ten
02:13 - we'll always show once let's refresh so
02:16 - one two three four five six seven eight
02:19 - nine ten
02:21 - it's shown ten times however if this if
02:25 - this at any point evaluates to folks
02:27 - we're always going to show the first one
02:29 - so why is this useful in programming
02:32 - like why would you want to do it well
02:34 - you might not be able to think of an
02:36 - example offhand but you may have an
02:39 - example you may come across an example
02:41 - in programming when you're maybe
02:42 - creating something for yourself or
02:44 - someone else well you think oh well I
02:46 - need to show this once I need to make an
02:48 - evaluation you're going to be think
02:50 - about the do-while loop because you're
02:52 - going to loop still but you're always
02:54 - going to show at least one thing or a
02:56 - process this block at least once so
02:59 - that's basically the do-while loop in
03:01 - PHP
