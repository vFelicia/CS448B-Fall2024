00:01 - right here trying to find the missing
00:03 - side of the quadrilaterals the
00:05 - quadrilaterals is just a fancy word for
00:07 - a four-sided shape so right here we have
00:11 - perimeter of six the perimeter is given
00:13 - so we have four eleven and thirteen
00:16 - always to do is add those sides together
00:18 - eleven thirteen four four or five six
00:23 - seven eight twenty eight right now have
00:26 - a total of 28 and we know we have to
00:28 - have 36 so we take 36 minus 28 borrow
00:34 - from the three eight zero so we know
00:40 - that the sides eight like a different
00:45 - color same thing with this side a
00:48 - perimeter is 40 that's sixteen fourteen
00:51 - and eight let's take 16 14 8 8 9 10 11
00:58 - 12 12 and 6 is 18 3 so we have 36 so far
01:07 - when trying to get to 40 so 40 - 38
01:11 - borrow from the 4 we have 2 and 0 so we
01:17 - know the size guy b2
01:19 - now over here we have a perimeter of 37
01:23 - so we add 911 we know it's 20 and plus 5
01:27 - is 25 so we take 37 minus 25 and 7 minus
01:35 - 5 is 2 and 3 minus 2 is 1 so we have a
01:41 - side of 12 and that's the simplest way
01:46 - of finding the missing edge of a
01:47 - perimeter if the perimeter is giving
01:50 - then it's pretty simple just to add up
01:51 - the rest of the sides and subtract the
01:53 - remaining sides with the total perimeter
01:56 - and that's your answer
