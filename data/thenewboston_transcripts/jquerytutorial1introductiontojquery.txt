00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org and
00:03 - this is a video tutorial for the New
00:05 - Boston in this video we're going to take
00:07 - a look at an introduction to jQuery what
00:10 - it is what it does and why we should use
00:12 - it in our
00:13 - websites now if you're looking to
00:15 - perform Ajax operations or cool effects
00:19 - in your website um and you are not
00:22 - completely familiar with JavaScript
00:24 - jQuery is a really easy and flexible way
00:26 - to integrate things like effects uh
00:30 - jQuery operations and so on uh into your
00:34 - website now jQuery is essentially a
00:36 - JavaScript library that contains a
00:39 - variety of functions and other
00:42 - functionality that allow you to do this
00:44 - uh extremely easily some of the benefits
00:47 - of jQuery it is that it is um a
00:51 - reasonably fast loading uh Library if
00:54 - you've used other JavaScript libraries
00:56 - you might find they are slow in
00:58 - comparison to jQuery we've also got
01:00 - cross browser compatibility so that
01:03 - brings us to one of the benefits of
01:05 - jQuery if you use jQuery in uh a variety
01:09 - of
01:09 - websites um you are first of all using
01:12 - the same standard so you're using
01:14 - exactly the same thing this is a benefit
01:16 - over writing the JavaScript code
01:18 - yourself and actually using uh raw
01:21 - JavaScript if you like um like I said we
01:24 - have cross browser compatibility which
01:26 - means that uh it will work through a
01:29 - variety of web browsers and if we go to
01:31 - jquery.com uh you can read a short
01:34 - paragraph about jQuery and some of the
01:37 - benefits here I've just scrolled over uh
01:40 - the cross browser tick and you can see
01:42 - that the uh the uh library is compatible
01:45 - with the following browsers and
01:47 - versions
01:49 - now jQuery is simply included into your
01:52 - page and we're going to be looking at
01:54 - that a bit later on you can download a
01:56 - production or development version the
01:58 - production version is suble for if you
02:00 - want to actually use jQuery and the
02:02 - development version is a slightly larger
02:05 - uncompressed version that just allows
02:07 - you to develop plugins we're going to be
02:09 - looking at plugins a bit later on
02:12 - anyway okay so once you've downloaded
02:14 - jQuery you can go ahead and include in
02:16 - your page and you can actually go ahead
02:19 - and start writing and using this now
02:22 - there's a short uh list of companies
02:25 - here that do actually use jQuery so you
02:27 - can see that it's an extremely popular
02:29 - and widely used um
02:32 - technology and uh because it's extremely
02:35 - easy to use it allows you to uh use
02:38 - these effects Ajax calls uh HTTP
02:41 - requests extremely easily so if you've
02:43 - seen for example Google um when you
02:46 - enter the search engine and you start
02:49 - typing the page changes you have results
02:52 - listed down the page so uh it's an
02:54 - extremely uh important part of the web
02:57 - now uh now that it's evolving into to a
03:00 - nicer looking place so why do we use
03:04 - jQuery the simple answer is that if you
03:07 - want to create your website or anything
03:10 - into your website that uh produces a
03:13 - lovely nice output then uh jQuery is
03:17 - probably the thing you want to use it's
03:19 - extremely popular and uh
03:22 - it's also extremely easy to
03:25 - use now there's an example on jquery.com
03:30 - um of a small uh paragraph here and this
03:33 - code will actually show um a particular
03:36 - um a a paragraph if you like so let's go
03:40 - down and just click on run code now you
03:43 - can see that we've just um been
03:45 - presented with this paragraph here and
03:48 - uh we have some text now this is just a
03:51 - one example of what jQuery can do we
03:53 - also have a wide um library of
03:56 - functionality with jQuery um we can do
03:59 - things like uh check if a username is
04:02 - available on a on a register form if you
04:05 - are using say PHP to develop your
04:08 - website you would love to know that
04:10 - jQuery will allow you to do things all
04:13 - on one page um for example check if a
04:16 - username is available in a database you
04:18 - can then return this and it will be
04:19 - displayed in the register form so
04:22 - essentially what we are looking at is
04:23 - creating a site that allows us to
04:27 - produce results onto a page with as
04:29 - little refreshing as possible so the
04:31 - main thing with jQuery is that the the
04:34 - Ajax functionality it uses allows you to
04:37 - implement Ajax into your website
04:39 - extremely easily now the jQuery website
04:43 - contains um a vast amount of
04:45 - documentation on EV pretty much
04:48 - everything however in this tutorial
04:50 - series I'm going to be taking you
04:51 - through all of these and actually giving
04:53 - you examples along the way as well as
04:55 - giving you some uh other information in
04:58 - a way that you can easily understand
05:01 - it so this paragraph here um pretty much
05:05 - sums jQuery up uh in the next video
05:08 - we're going going to actually look at an
05:10 - another example of jQuery and we're
05:12 - going to take a look at some code behind
05:13 - this uh just to show you how it's uh
05:16 - implemented uh then we're going to go on
05:18 - to look at actually implementing it into
05:20 - the site and creating our first short
05:22 - animation technique or animation effect
05:25 - and then we're going to go on to look at
05:27 - some more uh animation effect effects
05:29 - we're going to go into Ajax as well so
05:32 - it's it's an extremely powerful plug-in
05:35 - you'll also notice that there is a
05:37 - plugins um or extremely powerful Library
05:40 - sorry um you'll notice that there is
05:42 - actually a plugins uh tab up here on the
05:44 - jquery.com homepage and this is um a
05:49 - library of plugins that ver various
05:52 - developers have produced and this allows
05:55 - you to extend jquery's um functionality
05:58 - uh for a variety of different
06:00 - applications things like sliders uh
06:03 - different slideshows drag drag and
06:05 - droppable things just a wide plug-in
06:09 - library of different things you might
06:11 - find interesting so I'd obviously
06:14 - recommend that you learn jQuery before
06:15 - you start to use plugins um it's an
06:18 - extremely powerful tool and it's pretty
06:20 - much the future of um you know
06:22 - JavaScript in terms of How It's easily
06:25 - written some people do prefer to write
06:27 - JavaScript um on their own
06:30 - on its own without using a library such
06:32 - as jQuery and some people claim that
06:34 - jQuery is uh the easy option however
06:38 - because uh we have these wide uh variety
06:42 - of companies or a large variety of
06:43 - companies that are actually using jQuery
06:46 - it just goes to show that it is an
06:47 - extremely popular tool um that when
06:50 - implemented correctly um is extremely
06:52 - powerful
