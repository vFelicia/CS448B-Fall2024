00:00 - okay guys welcome to your 40 second
00:02 - tutorial in the udk and in this tutorial
00:05 - what we're going to be doing is
00:07 - kind of preparing our level a little
00:09 - better getting it ready so we can start
00:11 - working with kismet so the very first
00:14 - thing that we need to do is we need to
00:16 - add something called a trigger
00:18 - to our level so in order to do that go
00:21 - ahead where the light meets the dark on
00:23 - your level go ahead and right click
00:26 - somewhere in there and we want to add an
00:28 - actor and the actor that we want to add
00:30 - is a trigger
00:32 - now what a trigger is in the udk it's
00:35 - basically like a switch in real life
00:38 - it's something that your user can
00:39 - interact with to turn something on and
00:42 - off look at it it even looks like a
00:43 - switch that's probably why they named it
00:45 - trigger
00:46 - so
00:46 - now that we have that trigger
00:49 - it doesn't have any functionality yet
00:51 - it's just basically sitting there on the
00:52 - screen so you can tell already that this
00:55 - is a game element and whenever we right
00:57 - click and hit play from here
01:00 - then it's not going to be visible so
01:01 - what we want to do is just for testing
01:03 - purposes
01:04 - we want that to be visible whenever we
01:07 - play our level so go ahead and double
01:09 - click it and we're going to change a
01:11 - setting in here to make sure that it's
01:13 - visible and that is if you go under
01:16 - display you can see by default it's
01:18 - hidden in this checkbox means that it is
01:21 - indeed hidden whenever we play our level
01:24 - if you go ahead and deselect that then
01:27 - our trigger is no longer hidden so let
01:29 - me go ahead and demonstrate this if we
01:31 - go ahead and right click and hit play
01:32 - from here we can now see our trigger
01:36 - whenever we're playing our game right
01:37 - there
01:38 - so another thing that i forgot to do is
01:40 - actually rebuild my lighting so i'm
01:42 - going to go ahead and build that and
01:43 - while i'm doing that i guess i'll talk
01:45 - about this
01:46 - what we're going to be adding
01:48 - is right where the static meshes i'm
01:50 - going to be adding a toggle light so
01:53 - right now we just added a regular point
01:55 - light and that point light is going to
01:56 - stay on all the time
01:58 - but this trigger right here is going to
02:00 - control this light and this light is
02:02 - going to have the functionality to turn
02:04 - on and off so we don't want to add a
02:07 - regular point light because point lines
02:08 - just stay on all the time so what we
02:10 - need to do is we need to add a toggable
02:13 - point light and in order to do that
02:15 - here's what we do
02:17 - go up to where is it
02:19 - view
02:20 - browser windows actor classes and expand
02:23 - lights and under point lights
02:26 - look for point light toggle now just go
02:29 - ahead and select that and now that you
02:31 - have that selected you can just x out of
02:32 - here and now what you need to do is over
02:35 - by your static mesh actually i'm just
02:37 - going to click anywhere and i can i can
02:38 - move it around later go ahead and right
02:40 - click
02:41 - and press add
02:43 - point light toggle here and whenever you
02:46 - add that you get your point light toggle
02:48 - and again like i said i'm just going to
02:49 - adjust it right now probably my top view
02:52 - is the easiest
02:54 - just slide that over right there again
02:56 - you don't want it to sit right inside
02:58 - your static mesh or else you're going to
02:59 - get some weird weird shadows so just
03:02 - make sure it's sitting right outside
03:03 - your static mesh right there
03:05 - so that looks pretty good
03:07 - so now here's our lighting system with
03:09 - our regular light right here
03:12 - and if we go scroll up here we can see
03:14 - that the toggle light is right by the
03:16 - static mesh so this is the light that
03:18 - we're going to be controlling with this
03:20 - light switch or trigger right here so
03:22 - using this trigger we're going to be
03:24 - turning this light on and off however
03:26 - here's what i want to do
03:28 - by default as soon as we start our level
03:31 - well it's not going to work because i
03:33 - didn't build my lighting but as soon as
03:35 - we start our level this light is going
03:37 - to be on by default and i actually want
03:39 - to turn this light off by default so as
03:42 - soon as we start our level we need to
03:44 - turn it on so in order to do that you
03:46 - can either
03:47 - double click your light or if you select
03:50 - and hit f4 it's going to bring up the
03:52 - properties window and now when you're
03:54 - looking at the light properties go down
03:56 - to light
03:57 - light component
03:58 - light component and enabled right here
04:02 - you can see if you hover over it says is
04:03 - the light enabled this pretty much means
04:05 - is the light on or off by default now by
04:08 - default whenever you add a talkable
04:10 - light it's on but we want to add that
04:13 - off by default and as you can see in my
04:16 - level the light shuts off
04:18 - so now we have
04:21 - everything we have to set up for this
04:24 - level we have a regular this is
04:26 - basically just working like so when we
04:28 - first started a level we're not lost in
04:29 - the dark this doesn't really have any
04:31 - functionality that we're going to be
04:32 - messing with
04:34 - we added our trigger that our user can
04:36 - run into to turn the light on and off we
04:38 - have our static mesh of the light and we
04:41 - have our toggable light that's gonna be
04:43 - flickering on and off whenever we hit
04:45 - that trigger so now what we need to do
04:47 - is hop into kismet and actually piece
04:49 - everything together
04:51 - so what i'm gonna be doing is whenever
04:53 - i'm i stop this tutorial i'm going to
04:55 - rebuild my light so make sure between
04:57 - this tutorial and the next tutorial that
04:59 - you rebuild your light too so you can
05:00 - follow along with me so that's what i'm
05:03 - going to be doing and in the next
05:04 - tutorial we're going to be hopping in
05:06 - the kismet and piecing all these pieces
05:08 - together so thank you guys for watching
05:10 - don't forget to subscribe and i'll see
05:11 - you guys later
