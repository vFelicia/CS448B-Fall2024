00:01 - so our first lesson for our series on
00:04 - Geometry is going to deal with algebra
00:07 - applications with angles so basically
00:10 - today we're going to take your knowledge
00:12 - of geometry and your knowledge of some
00:15 - basic algebra skills we're going to put
00:18 - them together so that we can
00:19 - algebraically solve problems that deal
00:23 - with geometry principles I know it
00:25 - sounds like a lot but it's it's really
00:27 - not that much so let's start off with
00:31 - some
00:32 - examples so for example one we know that
00:35 - this angle equals 2x and this angle
00:38 - equals
00:39 - 80° so the first thing we have to notice
00:41 - about these two angles is that they're
00:43 - vertical angles and if you remember
00:46 - vertical angles are congruent so this is
00:52 - congruent so this angle is congruent
00:55 - with this
00:56 - angle so if two angles are rent that
01:00 - means that their measures are equal so
01:03 - to show that their measures are equal
01:05 - we're going to take
01:07 - 2X and set it equal to
01:09 - 80 now we can use some basic algebra
01:13 - skills to solve for x so if you divide
01:16 - both sides by two you get X is equal to
01:21 - 40° now for y we can set up two kinds of
01:27 - equations since we know
01:30 - that these two angles together make up
01:34 - this line that means that these two
01:36 - angles are supplementary so these two
01:39 - angles sum equals 180 so in order to
01:42 - show that we're going to take 2x plus
01:46 - the measure of Y and set it equal to
01:49 - 180 or you could notice that these two
01:53 - angles are
01:54 - supplementary and say y + 80 =
02:00 - 180 for this one it's going to take you
02:03 - a little less time you can just subtract
02:05 - 80 over and get y =
02:08 - 100 for this one you'd have to
02:11 - substitute our value of x in so 2 * 40 +
02:16 - y =
02:18 - 180 80 + y = 180 so y =
02:28 - 100° so now we're going to do another
02:30 - one and we know that the measure of
02:33 - angle b a d is
02:36 - 90° so that means that this the
02:44 - sum of these two
02:47 - angles because they're separated by this
02:50 - Ray
02:53 - AC is going to be 90° to so to show that
02:56 - we're going to take 4x + x
03:00 - equal
03:01 - 90° now we can do that because of the
03:06 - the addition property of angles in
03:09 - Geometry we always have to have a reason
03:12 - for why we're allowed to do something so
03:14 - our reason for this would
03:16 - be
03:19 - addition
03:22 - property of angles now we won't always
03:26 - have to write out that reason that's
03:27 - just good to know so that when you look
03:29 - back over this you know what we did so
03:32 - 4x + x gives me 5x = 90 divide both
03:37 - sides by five and you get X is equal to
03:45 - 18° now I'm not done quite yet because I
03:48 - found the value of x and the value of
03:52 - this angle which is
03:55 - 18° but now I need to find the value of
03:58 - this angle so I need to take
04:03 - 4X and plug in 18 for X so 4 * 18 is
04:10 - equal
04:12 - 72 now if you want to check your answer
04:15 - you can take
04:16 - 72 +
04:19 - 18 and set it equal to 90° and if you
04:22 - add these together you'll get 90 and
04:25 - since 90 does in fact equal 90 these two
04:29 - answers are right
04:31 - so we have a couple more examples we're
04:32 - going to
04:33 - do so we have this these two angles
04:37 - right here they both form a line so that
04:41 - means that these two angles are
04:43 - supplementary which means that there sum
04:46 - is equal to
04:48 - 180° so 4x - 20 + x is equal to
04:55 - 180° 4x + x is 5X - 20 is equal to
05:03 - 180° if you add 20 to both sides you get
05:06 - 5x is equal to
05:09 - 200° we're going to divide both sides by
05:12 - five we get X is equal
05:15 - to
05:17 - 40° now I have to go back in and plug
05:20 - this in to this equation so 4 * 40 - 20
05:28 - 4 * 40 is 160 - 20 gives
05:35 - me
05:37 - 140 and if you want to go back and
05:40 - check 140 +
05:43 - 40 and set it equal to
05:46 - 180 and 180 does in fact equal
05:50 - 180 so that's how we know those answers
05:52 - are right so we have one more problem
05:55 - we're going to do today so we're told
05:59 - that that angle l m k is a right
06:03 - angle so this big angle right here is a
06:06 - right angle since a right
06:10 - angle has a measure of
06:13 - 90° we know that this big angle has to
06:16 - equal
06:17 - 90° so that means the sum of each one of
06:20 - these little
06:22 - angles has to equal 90° so 2x +
06:28 - 20 we're going to add these two
06:31 - equations together and set it equal to
06:35 - 90° 2x + 4x is
06:40 - 6X 20 - 2 is
06:45 - 18 equal 90° if we subtract 18 over we
06:50 - get 6X is equal
06:52 - to so 6 x is = to 72 /
06:58 - 6 we we get X is equal to
07:02 - 12 now we can go back and we have to
07:07 - plug in this to these two
07:12 - equations because right now we only know
07:15 - what x equals we want to know what each
07:18 - of them angles
07:20 - equal so
07:22 - 4x - 12 excuse me minus 2 we're going to
07:28 - plug our X in so 4 * 12 - 2 4 * 12 is 48
07:35 - - 2 is 46 so the measure of this angle
07:38 - is
07:40 - 46°
07:42 - 46° now this angle we can solve it one
07:46 - of two ways we can do the same thing we
07:49 - did here and plug in X so we get 2 * 12
07:54 - + 20 2 * 12 is 24 + 20 gives me 44
08:01 - or I could have plugged it
08:04 - into this
08:07 - equation I plug in
08:09 - 46 for 4x - 2 = 90 and then 2x + 20 + 46
08:18 - = 90 I'd get
08:21 - 2x 20 + 46 gives me 66 = 90 If I
08:27 - subtract 66 over
08:30 - I'll
08:32 - get 2x is =
08:35 - to 24 so X is equal to 12 so that's
08:39 - another reason that's another way to
08:41 - check that my X is correct and I can PL
08:45 - or I could have done this and I could
08:48 - have taken 2x +
08:52 - 66 or not 66 2x + 20 + 46 is equal to
09:01 - 90 minus the 46 over and I would have
09:04 - got 2x + 20 is equal to
09:08 - 44 so you don't always have to check
09:10 - your answers that many times but it's
09:12 - good to practice when we started
09:17 - out so that was our first lesson in
09:21 - Geometry not too bad um but make sure
09:25 - you come back and watch our next lesson
09:26 - where we're going to talk about symmetry
09:28 - of shapes
