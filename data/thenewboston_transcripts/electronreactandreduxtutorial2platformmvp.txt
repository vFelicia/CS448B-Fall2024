00:00 - alrighty everyone welcome back to
00:02 - another video and I know in the last
00:04 - video I said I was going to be going
00:06 - over project structure in this video but
00:09 - I actually want to save that for a
00:10 - little bit later on because in this one
00:12 - I want to show you some of the updates
00:15 - that I've been working on
00:16 - so first of all as you can probably
00:18 - notice I updated the UI a bit I have
00:21 - these custom app icons that we're going
00:23 - to be building on the left and all of
00:25 - the other kind of system apps and system
00:27 - settings on the right felt a little bit
00:29 - cleaner that way and I also built out a
00:33 - lot of the networking logic
00:35 - so right now what I have is the core
00:38 - server up and running it's live on the
00:40 - back end and I am now connected to it
00:43 - from this machine and just to give you a
00:46 - perspective of
00:48 - um kind of my environment right now I'm
00:50 - sitting in my office right now and I'm
00:52 - recording on my iMac but I also have my
00:55 - laptop running uh or sitting right next
00:58 - to me and it's running this exact
00:59 - software as well
01:01 - so both of these devices are connected
01:04 - to the same network
01:05 - not only that but they are actually
01:08 - connected in a way where they can
01:10 - communicate with one another
01:11 - so in order to demonstrate that I'll
01:15 - show you the first app that I built out
01:17 - and that is this uh chat MVP so this is
01:22 - kind of the ping pong app that I said I
01:24 - was going to write in the last video but
01:27 - I also added some additional
01:28 - functionality as well and that is well
01:32 - might as well show you what's going on
01:33 - right here
01:34 - so in this app
01:37 - um pretty much a basic chat app you can
01:39 - send messages back and forth so right
01:42 - now I'm just sending you know basic text
01:44 - data to my MacBook and another cool
01:46 - thing just some kind of chat
01:48 - functionality I can edit that message if
01:51 - I want and I can also delete it and I
01:54 - know you guys can't see this but I will
01:58 - I'll send a message from my MacBook
02:00 - right there
02:02 - and now let me edit it
02:04 - tuna
02:06 - I'll say tuna
02:08 - Sandy
02:10 - and let me go ahead and delete that
02:13 - all right so there's the demo probably
02:16 - the most boring demo that you ever seen
02:18 - in your life it looks and functions like
02:20 - uh very MVP normal chat app however the
02:25 - very cool thing about this architecture
02:26 - is that even though it looks and
02:28 - functions like a normal chat app there's
02:30 - actually no centralized database being
02:33 - used to store any of this app data all
02:35 - of this app data including these
02:38 - contacts right here
02:39 - and the messages themselves and the
02:42 - delivery statuses all of this is stored
02:45 - directly on the devices themselves and
02:48 - well actually I I lied about that we are
02:51 - logging the blocks let me pull this up
02:53 - in case you want to follow along with
02:55 - this
02:56 - so right now we are logging the blocks
02:59 - which in other words is just like the
03:01 - messages sent back and forth between
03:02 - devices we are logging them on the back
03:05 - end for kind of debugging and
03:07 - development purposes however the
03:11 - um
03:12 - tnbos it doesn't like pull from the back
03:15 - end at all it's purely for debugging
03:16 - purposes and we have that ticket right
03:18 - there to remove that functionality or
03:20 - turn it off by default but yeah I just
03:23 - want to kind of point that out
03:25 - now another cool feature about tnbos
03:29 - that I built in is some fault tolerance
03:31 - logic and yes I know that cool and fault
03:35 - tolerance aren't normally used in the
03:37 - same sense but I want to show you this
03:40 - because well I thought it was cool at
03:41 - least
03:42 - so as you know from the last video the
03:44 - basic architecture of the system is
03:47 - pretty much to have some devices hooked
03:48 - up to a single server and then through
03:52 - that server they can send messages back
03:53 - and forth pretty simple however right
03:56 - now I have my iMac communicating with my
04:00 - laptop and they're connected through two
04:02 - different servers now this isn't
04:05 - necessary for kind of this architecture
04:07 - to work but the reason I have it written
04:10 - that's what this way is because if one
04:13 - of these servers ever goes offline then
04:16 - these devices are still able to
04:18 - communicate with each other
04:20 - and I'll show you in the UI how we can
04:22 - see that so right now let me uh this is
04:26 - kind of cluttery looking all right so
04:28 - right now my iMac is connected through
04:31 - my MacBook through these two networks
04:33 - right here uh VTX and tnb they're pretty
04:36 - much just two servers I spun up and just
04:38 - added these uh you know this little text
04:41 - to give it a shorter identifier but you
04:44 - can see in this top right that those
04:47 - icons have green rings around them and
04:49 - it means that these are pretty much like
04:51 - two channels that you can send data
04:53 - through
04:53 - now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go on
04:57 - my MacBook and I'm just gonna completely
05:00 - delete and I'll show you what I'm doing
05:02 - on my MacBook
05:03 - actually I can do it right here
05:05 - so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go in
05:08 - my network manager and just completely
05:10 - delete one of these networks I say I'm
05:12 - going to delete tnb completely so
05:15 - whenever I do that you can see that I
05:18 - can still
05:19 - send messages
05:24 - back and forth
05:26 - so yeah I know that this is uh
05:28 - definitely Overkill especially for like
05:30 - a private Network where you're just like
05:32 - uh changing some of your digital picture
05:36 - frames or I don't know making a plant
05:38 - watering system or something but I did
05:40 - think it was pretty cool how these
05:41 - devices can still communicate even if
05:44 - one of the uh nodes or servers between
05:46 - them that allows them to communicate it
05:49 - goes down they still can kind of I don't
05:51 - know almost work organically and find
05:53 - another path between one another
05:55 - so like I said
05:57 - um if you're into fault tolerance uh I
05:59 - thought that was pretty cool at least so
06:01 - with all of that uh yeah pretty cool we
06:04 - have the very basic uh structure MVP
06:07 - build out now in the upcoming videos
06:10 - what I have planned is let's see have a
06:14 - little guide on the right side of my
06:16 - screen here all right so in the next
06:19 - video I'm planning on going through
06:20 - spinning up one of these uh servers
06:23 - right here and I'll also show you how to
06:27 - set up a domain name with SSL I know a
06:30 - lot of people look for that and there's
06:31 - not a lot of great content online for
06:33 - that so I'll take you through that
06:35 - process and then once we have that I'll
06:38 - show you how to connect to your server
06:40 - with tnb OS it's pretty simple you
06:44 - pretty much just hit add Network and I'm
06:45 - sure you can figure all this out just
06:47 - fill in the form and hit submit but
06:49 - we'll go through that process and also
06:53 - um right now we already saw one of these
06:56 - apps the chat app there's another kind
06:58 - of simple University app I called it
07:01 - this isn't functional or anything right
07:03 - now it just says University and that's
07:04 - it and the reason that I wrote this
07:07 - separate app is I just wanted to kind of
07:10 - create this MVP having something else is
07:13 - an app mainly to ensure that I could
07:16 - pretty much write this architecture that
07:18 - supported multiple apps in that I wasn't
07:21 - like hard coding too many things into a
07:23 - single app and then once I added another
07:24 - one I was going to have to go back and
07:26 - rewrite a bunch of stuff yada yada
07:27 - either way not important the point being
07:30 - is that in the upcoming tutorial I'm
07:33 - also going to be building a simple speed
07:36 - test app and all this app is going to do
07:39 - is it's pretty much gonna
07:41 - um well let me pull this up again it's
07:43 - going to be similar to this architecture
07:45 - where you're just going to send like a
07:47 - ping message and it's going to send you
07:48 - back a pong message and it's just going
07:50 - to time how long that takes so we can
07:52 - see how fast this network actually is
07:54 - but in terms of app development what
07:57 - that means is we're going to be
07:59 - designing the protocol in other words
08:01 - the rules for how those two devices
08:03 - communicate with one another should be
08:05 - pretty simple since it's only like one
08:07 - request in response cycle and then we're
08:10 - also going to be designing and building
08:12 - out the UI it's probably only going to
08:14 - be like one component or I don't know
08:16 - one container a couple components but
08:19 - yeah show you how to build a simple
08:20 - speed test app
08:22 - and then after all of that uh we will
08:26 - then hop into some of this tnb OS
08:29 - architecture I'll go through some of
08:31 - these more technical details of exactly
08:34 - how tnbos communicates with the core
08:36 - server and how it keeps track of what
08:38 - other devices are in line so on and so
08:41 - forth and even though a lot of this
08:43 - isn't strictly necessary in terms of app
08:46 - development since you know the idea is
08:48 - to have a lot of this logic abstracted
08:50 - away
08:51 - I did want to go over it because I want
08:53 - to hear all of your feedback on well
08:55 - quite a few things like I said in the
08:57 - last video there are lots of interesting
08:59 - challenges that I came across when
09:01 - building everything out so I want to
09:04 - hear your thoughts on some of the
09:05 - architecture and design patterns
09:06 - especially since to my knowledge nothing
09:09 - like this has really been uh built or
09:12 - nothing that I found online exactly like
09:14 - this so I just want to hear your
09:15 - thoughts and see if I can improve
09:17 - anything and aside from that it's always
09:20 - good to have a solid foundation before
09:22 - you know building too much on top of it
09:24 - but yeah that's uh pretty much all I
09:27 - wanted to cover in this video so as
09:30 - always if anyone has any questions or if
09:33 - anyone gets stuck on anything throughout
09:34 - the series uh there's a Discord Link in
09:38 - the description below I'll also include
09:40 - the links to the GitHub repos both for
09:43 - tnbos which again is a electron react
09:46 - and Redux app and also the core server
09:49 - repo which is a Django application
09:52 - pretty much just allows devices to
09:54 - communicate almost acts as a router in a
09:56 - way and yeah I think that's pretty much
09:59 - it so in the next video we're going to
10:01 - be deploying a server see you then
