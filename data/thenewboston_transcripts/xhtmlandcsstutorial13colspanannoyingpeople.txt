00:00 - all right guys welcome to your 13th
00:02 - xhtml and CSS tutorial in this tutorial
00:05 - we're going to be covering something
00:06 - called a coal span now whenever you make
00:10 - a table you don't always want to make a
00:12 - perfect grid you don't always want the
00:14 - same number of columns on every Row
00:17 - three three three three that gets boring
00:20 - and it's just not useful so maybe you
00:23 - want to make a table that has one column
00:25 - at the top and two columns in the middle
00:29 - and maybe five columns at the end so
00:31 - maybe you want to change it up a bit but
00:33 - from what we know so far we don't know
00:35 - how to do that well this tutorial is
00:37 - going to show you how so for example
00:40 - well let me do this first let's go ahead
00:42 - and create a
00:44 - table so we have something to work with
00:46 - and let's go ahead and make it four
00:49 - rows press tab table
00:52 - row table row so let's copy
00:57 - this and easy fingers take it easy there
01:01 - so now we have a table with four rows in
01:03 - it and might as well add our little
01:05 - border attribute so we don't get
01:07 - confused now in our first row let's go
01:10 - ahead and add that main title across the
01:12 - top so let's say for the rest of this
01:15 - table in these rows let's go ahead and
01:17 - make it simple and only add two columns
01:20 - but for this first one we want a title
01:22 - big and centered and we want it to span
01:25 - across two columns so there's only going
01:27 - to be one piece of data in here but it's
01:30 - going to cover two columns worth of
01:32 - information so let's go ahead and make
01:34 - it a table header because you know those
01:36 - are the pieces of data that stand out
01:39 - and let's go ahead and make a table
01:41 - about odd
01:43 - people and for our table header first
01:46 - and foremost we need to introduce that
01:49 - attribute called
01:51 - cpan and set this equal to two now Co
01:54 - span stands for column span and it says
01:57 - how many columns do you want to span
01:59 - this p piece of data across well we
02:01 - wanted to take up two columns so that's
02:04 - how you do that make col span equal two
02:06 - and actually one other thing we can do
02:07 - while we're here is we can go ahead and
02:09 - make this a header three that will uh
02:12 - make it a little bigger and bold as well
02:15 - so odd people is going to be spanning
02:17 - across two columns it's going to be
02:19 - bolded and centered so now in our second
02:23 - row let's go ahead and add some data
02:25 - actually let's go ahead and add two more
02:28 - headers and let me just go ahead and
02:30 - copy
02:32 - this so the First Column is going to be
02:35 - the type of people I find odd and the
02:38 - second column is going to be the reason
02:39 - I find them odd so in our third row
02:42 - let's go ahead and start populating the
02:44 - table with some data so
02:47 - [Music]
02:48 - TD
02:49 - TD and let's go ahead and copy this
02:52 - because I am way too lazy to type all
02:54 - that again and paste it so the first
02:57 - type of people that I find out are cat
02:59 - people
03:00 - and the reason I find them odd let's
03:02 - just write um something like seven cats
03:05 - is just too many because seriously
03:08 - people anything over like three then
03:10 - you're uh you're kind of pushing the
03:12 - limit there so just take it easy and
03:14 - back off you don't need that many cats
03:16 - trust me they want the attention not
03:18 - company so let's go ahead and uh copy
03:21 - this right here and in our last
03:24 - row paste this and let's find another
03:27 - type of people um let me think
03:30 - allow people I find them odd and the
03:33 - reason I find them odd is because let's
03:35 - put sure turn
03:39 - that music
03:41 - up it's only 300 a.m. and make sure you
03:45 - spell music wrong and it looks good so
03:47 - we are good to go cuz you know at 3:00
03:50 - a.m. really do you need to be blaring
03:52 - your music as loud as you possibly can
03:54 - that's just annoying so anyways go ahead
03:56 - and save this and see what we got
03:59 - refresh it and check it out the main odd
04:03 - people you can see that this table
04:05 - basically consists of two columns one
04:07 - two but this main one right here we told
04:10 - to Coal span two if you remember right
04:13 - there so what this did is it took this
04:16 - piece of data and expand it across two
04:19 - columns one column and two column and
04:22 - the rest of this was just stuff we
04:23 - learned before the table headers type
04:26 - and reason that's why they are bolded
04:30 - and
04:31 - centered and the table data which is
04:34 - just regular dumb old
04:36 - data is just plain old text left
04:39 - Justified see this is pushed to the left
04:41 - everything's pushed to the left so that
04:43 - is how you make you know this is a
04:45 - pretty organized looking table it's a
04:47 - lot easier to read than you know if you
04:49 - didn't use col span or didn't bold
04:51 - anything so anyways that's a useful
04:54 - table so if you ever are wondering hey I
04:56 - wonder what type of people Bucky finds
04:58 - odd you can go back to this and use it
05:01 - as a reference so anyways uh thank you
05:03 - guys for watching don't forget to
05:04 - subscribe and I will see you guys later
