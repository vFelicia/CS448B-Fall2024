00:00 - I'm then gonna go ahead and bind on
00:02 - another attribute function and we're
00:04 - going to change in fact no we're not
00:06 - we're going to change the text of the
00:08 - dialogue now what the div this is what
00:10 - this is going to do is place text in
00:12 - here so we've already determined the
00:15 - title we now want to go ahead and place
00:18 - text inside of here so in jQuery we use
00:21 - the text function so I'm just gonna say
00:25 - settings were saved for example okay so
00:30 - now what's going to happen is we've
00:31 - changed the title and the text within
00:33 - this div so now we've predefined what we
00:37 - want to display before we go ahead and
00:39 - display it so now at the end of this we
00:41 - can use the dialogue widget and that
00:43 - will then substitute in them variables
00:46 - and then show the show the dialogue so
00:49 - now when we click Save we have saved and
00:51 - settings were saved
00:52 - so we've now achieved a sort of like a a
00:55 - global div that we can use for any
00:57 - dialogue we want okay so now what we
01:01 - want to do is take a look at some of the
01:02 - settings we can apply to this dialog box
01:04 - first of all it's important to note that
01:06 - our page is still active so we can still
01:09 - click on specific things and we might
01:12 - not want to be able to do that so we're
01:15 - gonna gradually go through and change
01:16 - this dialog too as you saw it in the
01:18 - first part of the tutorial and I'll
01:20 - explain each option on the way so you'll
01:22 - know what to do with them and how to
01:24 - change them and there are a variety of
01:26 - other options as well ok so inside of
01:30 - here we want to go ahead and start to
01:32 - change our settings inside our dialog
01:34 - definition just here so inside here we
01:37 - need some curly brackets the first thing
01:39 - I'm gonna do is go ahead and set my own
01:41 - predefined button or customize button
01:44 - and that's going to be an OK button just
01:46 - here so let's go ahead and the option of
01:50 - buttons now this starts to look a bit
01:54 - tricky so I'm gonna pull this down here
01:57 - in fact now let's keep that up there I'm
02:00 - going to okay so let me start again the
02:03 - buttons option takes
02:06 - more parameters inside curly brackets so
02:09 - now I can start to create a function
02:11 - inside of here
02:13 - once I have predefined which button I
02:15 - want to be associated with which
02:17 - function so I'm going to define a button
02:19 - okay and then using a colon I'm going to
02:23 - define a function here and more curly
02:27 - brackets and I'm going to pull this down
02:28 - so now inside of here this is what's
02:31 - going to happen when this okay button
02:33 - we've given it the label okay is pressed
02:35 - so we've defined a button called okay
02:37 - and then the function associated with
02:39 - this okay button goes here what you can
02:42 - then do is you could go ahead and comma
02:44 - separate this here and create another
02:46 - button so for example not okay you
02:49 - wouldn't have a button like that but
02:51 - then you could define another function
02:52 - and so on and then you could create more
02:54 - after that but obviously for now we're
02:57 - just creating one button which is okay
02:59 - so I'm just gonna test this and I'm
03:01 - gonna say alert hello so now what's
03:05 - going to happen is we have this okay
03:07 - button that's appeared with our label
03:08 - when I click on it we have this dialog
03:10 - box saying hello so we know that it's
03:12 - working but what we want to happen is
03:14 - when we click OK we want this to close I
03:16 - know we already have the X button up
03:18 - here that we can press to close it off
03:20 - but you might want to incorporate other
03:22 - buttons into this dialog that don't just
03:25 - close it that might want to do something
03:26 - else but for now inside of here instead
03:28 - of an alert dialog I'm just going to
03:30 - demonstrate what we can do with closing
03:32 - this so what we're gonna do is the
03:34 - selector we're going to be using is this
03:36 - so we're referencing the dialogue itself
03:39 - and then I'm just gonna say doc dialogue
03:42 - close so what that's going to do is
03:45 - that's going to closed off this dialogue
03:47 - so let me just go ahead and refresh and
03:48 - click Save now when we press ok this
03:51 - closes so we've determined that pressing
03:55 - ok is now going to close the dialogue
03:57 - and the variety of other options you can
04:00 - supply within here but obviously for now
04:02 - this okay button is just going to close
04:05 - okay so now what we want to do is we
04:07 - want to supply some more some more
04:11 - options so just after you can see this
04:13 - is highlighted in red here
04:15 - is starting to look a bit messy we're
04:17 - going to supply more options just here
04:19 - so the first option I'm going to choose
04:22 - is clothes on escape now what clothes on
04:26 - escape does is it will actually close
04:28 - this dialog box if the user presses
04:30 - escape on their keyboard so at the
04:32 - moment we can close it either here we
04:34 - can close it either here here or you can
04:36 - have a variety of other buttons or I'm
04:38 - just again I'm just going to go ahead
04:40 - and press escape on my keyboard which
04:42 - I've just done and that has closed the
04:44 - dialog box so by defining this option
04:47 - here closed on escape set to true by
04:50 - default it's set to false the user can
04:53 - press escape on their keyboard and that
04:55 - dialog box will close so let's go ahead
04:58 - and define some more options the first
05:00 - the other thing you'll notice with this
05:02 - is that it is draggable we can drag it
05:05 - around the page which might be a bit of
05:07 - a pain we might not want to drag this
05:09 - around the page if you had some perhaps
05:11 - content in here that you wanted the user
05:13 - to be able to move and work on more here
05:16 - you're more than welcome to have it
05:17 - draggable but for now I'm just creating
05:20 - a dialog box with a notification so I
05:22 - want this to be not draggable or not to
05:25 - be draggable so I'm just going to simply
05:27 - divide define the draggable option and
05:30 - I'm gonna set this to false quite simply
05:31 - and now when i refresh I can't actually
05:34 - drag it around it won't let me drag it
05:35 - trying to click won't work the other
05:38 - problem we have is that this dialog is
05:41 - now resizable I can resize it from the
05:43 - top I can resize it from the sides I can
05:47 - resize it using this keep not keeping an
05:49 - aspect ratio now there are a variety of
05:52 - options you can do if you would like the
05:54 - user to be able to resize a dialog box
05:57 - you can set a minimum height and a
05:59 - minimum width we looked at the jQuery
06:02 - interactions and the draggable
06:04 - interaction sorry the resizable
06:07 - interaction in jQuery UI which allow
06:10 - which allowed us to set a minimum width
06:12 - and a minimum height that a particular
06:14 - element can be resized to in this case
06:17 - we don't really want the user to be
06:18 - resizing this dialog box around we can
06:21 - set the we can either set or keep it as
06:24 - cific sighs so what I'm gonna do is I'm
06:27 - gonna go over to you ijs and I'm gonna
06:29 - supply resizable folks so I'm changing
06:34 - resizable the ability to resize it to
06:36 - false so now when i refresh the first
06:39 - thing you'll notice is this little
06:40 - resize icon is gone and now we can't
06:43 - move it and we can't resize it so it's
06:46 - just a static dialog box in the middle
06:49 - of the page we can go ahead and close
06:52 - that now
