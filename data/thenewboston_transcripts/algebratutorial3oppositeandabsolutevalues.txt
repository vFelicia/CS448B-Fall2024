00:01 - okay so today we're going to talk about
00:04 - opposites and absolute values the
00:07 - opposite is when you take the opposite
00:13 - sign of something so say you had
00:16 - positive five if you took the opposite
00:18 - of it you would have negative five and
00:20 - when you take the absolute value which
00:24 - is indicated by these bars right here
00:29 - you take the positive value so opposite
00:33 - is just the opposite value absolute
00:36 - means the positive value so for this
00:41 - when you take the opposite sign of five
00:43 - see and 90 so we get negative 5c -9 D
00:49 - and for our absolute value we would do
00:54 - the subtraction inside the absolute
00:55 - value bars so you get negative two and
00:58 - then these bars tell you to take the
01:02 - positive value so the positive value of
01:05 - negative 2 is positive 2 okay so now
01:12 - we're gonna do some examples so I have
01:14 - negative 12 and I want the absolute
01:17 - value of negative 12 so that means that
01:20 - our answer is going to be 12 so I have
01:24 - the absolute value of negative 25 which
01:27 - is 25 minus the absolute value of 14 of
01:32 - negative 14 which is 14 and if I
01:36 - subtract those two I'll get 11 okay so
01:42 - these once again are brackets that means
01:45 - you do what's inside the brackets and
01:47 - then you add so I'm going to take
01:52 - negative 18 plus I have negative 13 this
01:56 - minus outside tells me to take the
01:58 - opposite value so these this becomes
02:02 - positive so I've plus 13 so negative a
02:07 - negative 18 plus 13 gives me negative 5
02:13 - okay so this negative out front tells me
02:16 - that I want the opposite value of each
02:18 - so this is gonna be positive it's gonna
02:21 - be positive so then I'm gonna get 2x
02:27 - plus 3y okay now when I have this
02:36 - negative out front it tells me to take
02:38 - the opposite this 2 right here tells me
02:41 - to multiply each one of these terms by 2
02:47 - and this night and this negative tells
02:50 - me to take the opposite side so I'm
02:53 - gonna have this is positive 3 so I'm
02:55 - going to take the opposite sign which is
02:57 - a negative of 2 times 3 which is 6 and
03:01 - then this M Squared stays the same I
03:03 - have negative 2 M so I'm gonna take the
03:07 - opposite which is positive of 2 times 2
03:11 - which is 4 M and then this last one is
03:16 - negative 1 and take the opposite of
03:19 - which is positive of 2 times 1 which is
03:23 - 2 and here I have opposite absolute
03:28 - value - absolute value so what I want
03:34 - you to realize is that this negative
03:36 - right here can be written as plus
03:39 - negative 9 absolute value of negative 9
03:44 - so this lets me know that I'm going to
03:47 - take the opposite of the absolute value
03:49 - of negative 3 and the opposite of the
03:51 - absolute value of negative 9 so I have
03:54 - the opposite sign um-
03:58 - absolute value of negative 3 the
04:00 - absolute value of negative 3 is positive
04:02 - 3 but I have this opposite out front
04:05 - plus the opposite of the absolute value
04:11 - of negative 9 which is 9 so I'm negative
04:16 - 3 plus negative 9 which gives me
04:18 - negative 12 so that's all we're gonna do
04:22 - with opposites and absolute values
04:25 - make sure you come back we're going to
04:28 - talk about how to combine like terms of
04:31 - equations
