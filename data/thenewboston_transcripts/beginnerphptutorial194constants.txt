00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org and
00:03 - this is a PHP video tutorial for the New
00:05 - Boston in this tutorial we're going to
00:07 - be look at looking at constants in um CL
00:11 - within classes so within objectoriented
00:15 - programming so first of all let's talk
00:17 - about what a constant is now a constant
00:20 - is not actually a variable it's a value
00:23 - that's assigned almost like in the same
00:25 - way as a variable but it will always
00:27 - remain the same so you're not going to
00:29 - be able to change the value of this
00:32 - constant hence the name constant is
00:34 - constantly the same value so let's have
00:36 - a look at a few examples we've got Pi
00:39 - for example is
00:41 - 3141 so this would be a constant because
00:44 - Pi the value of pi is never going to
00:46 - change we could also have something like
00:50 - um someone's name for example if you
00:53 - were specifying a page with just a
00:54 - single name that you knew would never
00:56 - change could be a constant so anything
00:58 - can really be a constant but looking at
01:00 - more literal constants like the value of
01:02 - pi which will never change so what we're
01:05 - going to do in this tutorial is we're
01:06 - going to create a class that's going to
01:08 - calculate the area of a circle so we're
01:11 - going to create a circle class we're
01:13 - going to have a constant in there called
01:14 - Pi I'm going to show you how to um how
01:18 - to use this constant because we don't we
01:20 - can't use constants in the same way that
01:22 - we can use variables um and then we're
01:26 - going to create a method that's going to
01:27 - calculate the area and then outside of
01:29 - our class we'll create a new instance of
01:31 - our class and we will um we will find
01:34 - the area with a given radius so the
01:36 - first thing we need to do is is create
01:38 - our class so I'm going to call this
01:39 - class Circle so let's bring down with
01:42 - our curly brackets we need to now create
01:45 - our constant so I'm going to first of
01:47 - all demonstrate how we ACC access this
01:49 - constant outside of our class and then
01:51 - we can use our method within to uh use
01:54 - this constant value so we're going to
01:56 - use the const keyword and then we're
01:58 - going to say Pi = 3
02:00 - .41 and that's it we've created our
02:02 - constant the name of our constant is pi
02:05 - for pi and our constant keyword lets us
02:08 - know that it's a constant now outside of
02:11 - our Circle class what happens if we were
02:15 - to say Circle equals New Circle so let's
02:20 - just oh without the parenthesis let's
02:21 - just double check that that works yeah
02:24 - that's fine so we've refreshed the page
02:25 - and no errors now what I want to do is
02:27 - say Circle
02:29 - and usually to reference a variable or a
02:32 - property within our in our class we
02:34 - would use the hyphen and the greater
02:36 - than sign to say within and then we
02:38 - could say Pi so this is just going to
02:40 - return the value of pi also we think it
02:43 - may not do let's Echo it out and see
02:45 - what we
02:47 - get Okay so we've got undefined property
02:49 - circle Pi and we think we think well why
02:52 - I mean the key is in this dollar sign
02:54 - here this uh denotes a variable in PHP
02:58 - or a property in um inside of a class so
03:01 - you can see that it's trying to look for
03:04 - this um for this Pi variable and it
03:07 - can't find it so how do we how do we um
03:11 - you know Echo out this value of pi if we
03:13 - can't use this method well what we do is
03:15 - we use something um with a with a double
03:19 - colon so we say Circle double colon Pi
03:22 - now let's refresh oh okay so we've got
03:25 - this error so um let's go ahead and and
03:28 - change this what we need to do is we
03:30 - need to say
03:31 - Echo Circle then our two colons then Pi
03:35 - so now we're getting the value of pi
03:37 - from the circle class so now we've got
03:39 - the constant value um displayed to us so
03:43 - what we can do is we can make use of
03:45 - this inside of our class as well as well
03:47 - as outside our class we're not going to
03:49 - be echoing um the pi constant outside of
03:53 - our class but we're going to be creating
03:54 - a method now inside of our class that's
03:57 - going going to calculate the area so
03:59 - this is going to be a public function
04:02 - and it's going to be called area
04:04 - remember to create your um parenthesis
04:06 - here for your arguments and your
04:09 - um curly brackets curly parenthesis
04:13 - we're going to take in a value um inside
04:15 - our area method and this is going to be
04:18 - radius so this is the argument that
04:20 - we're going to take in and process okay
04:22 - so now what we want to do is we want to
04:24 - return the value of the area so the um
04:28 - formula for the area of a circle is PK R
04:31 - 2 so what we're going to do is we're
04:33 - simply going to
04:34 - return
04:36 - Pi
04:39 - time radius time
04:42 - radius so what we're doing here is we're
04:44 - multiplying radius by itself so we're
04:46 - we're squaring radius and then we're
04:48 - multiplying it by pi now this isn't
04:50 - going to work as it stands I've I've
04:52 - written this like this on purpose
04:54 - because you know that we need some way
04:56 - to access um remember before we used
04:59 - this like this so this and then a hyphen
05:02 - and a greater than sign Pi so we're
05:04 - getting the value of pi from this class
05:07 - as a whole however this isn't going to
05:09 - work so let's demonstrate it first
05:11 - without this and then we'll add that in
05:13 - and see that it doesn't work as well so
05:16 - we've got nothing here so
05:19 - um in fact hold on let's come down and
05:22 - uh we'll create a new instance of our
05:24 - class so let's go Circle equals
05:27 - New Circle
05:30 - and then we'll say Circle and we'll say
05:33 - area and we'll give it a value so we'll
05:35 - say 100 let's come in and refresh now we
05:39 - can see use of undefined constant Pi
05:42 - assumed Pi so here we have um use of an
05:47 - undefined constant Pi now we have
05:49 - defined it up here however we need to
05:52 - access it in a slightly different way
05:55 - now usually we'd write this uh like this
05:57 - so we'd do this and a hyphen and a
05:59 - greater than sign and this would usually
06:02 - work let's refresh you can see we've got
06:04 - undefined property again the same error
06:06 - as we were getting up before so it's
06:08 - slightly different now remember I said
06:10 - you can use the double um colon to
06:12 - access the uh Properties or constants
06:15 - outside of your class you can do that
06:17 - within as well but this time instead of
06:20 - writing this you need to write self and
06:22 - this is this is without a um this is
06:26 - without a dollar sign the reason for
06:28 - this without a dollar sign is that when
06:29 - not actually dealing with a variable
06:31 - we're dealing with a constant so itself
06:33 - just on its own two colons Pi the name
06:37 - of your constant which in our case is pi
06:39 - and then you can perform the rest of the
06:41 - operation so we've got return self PI so
06:44 - now let's refresh and you'll see that
06:46 - we've got no errors we haven't got any
06:48 - output yet because we haven't echoed out
06:50 - the value that this method has returned
06:52 - so we have a return value here from this
06:54 - method so let's go ahead and Echo that
06:56 - out and see if that
06:58 - works okay so we've got a value return
07:00 - of
07:02 - 31,41 um this is
07:05 - right uh the reason we can tell that the
07:07 - calculations have worked is because
07:08 - obviously our value of pi is
07:11 - 3141 uh 3 sorry
07:14 - 3141 and we've multiplied that
07:16 - essentially by um um 100
07:19 - squar so we know this is correct this
07:22 - value is correct okay so that is um
07:25 - constants within um object oriented
07:27 - programming with PHP um how to access
07:30 - them outside your class how to access
07:32 - them inside your class using this self
07:35 - um and the two colons and also a little
07:38 - program that we've uh created here to
07:40 - calculate the area of a circle
