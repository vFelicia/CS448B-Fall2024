00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the New Boston
00:06 - in this video we're going to be taking a
00:07 - look at the height and width properties
00:09 - in jQuery and how we can retrieve the
00:12 - height and the width of any particular
00:15 - element uh obviously we can also then
00:17 - apply this to the document window or the
00:20 - document itself or the browser window
00:22 - and the document itself so the first
00:25 - thing I'm going to go ahead and do is
00:26 - create a div on the page uh and we'll
00:29 - just put some content in here it doesn't
00:31 - really matter uh what we do um with
00:35 - regards to the ID let's go ahead and
00:36 - give it a name of something just like
00:38 - div something generic uh I'm then going
00:40 - to go ahead and style this uh so we can
00:43 - actually set uh some properties to it
00:46 - ourself so the first thing I'm just
00:48 - going to do is give it a background
00:49 - color uh just so we can see uh the sort
00:52 - of physical height and width of it uh
00:55 - and then I'm going to go ahead and
00:56 - actually set a height and width to it so
00:58 - I'm going to give it 100 pixel
01:00 - and the width I'm going to give it 250
01:03 - pixels so on our page now we can see uh
01:06 - that we've got a div here with some
01:08 - content and it's 250 width and 100
01:12 - height so now what I'm going to do is
01:14 - I'm going to go ahead uh in actual fact
01:17 - probably better to get rid of this
01:18 - content and I'm going to replace the
01:20 - content inside of the div with the
01:22 - height and the width of the div so we uh
01:26 - come over to ext.js which I have
01:28 - included on my page as well as jQuery
01:32 - and we can start to write our code out
01:33 - in here so I'm first of all going to say
01:36 - document. ready just when the Dom's
01:38 - loaded and we are ready to start um you
01:43 - know start outputting we just do this
01:44 - usually in J uh in
01:46 - jQuery uh and I'm going to go ahead and
01:48 - set uh two variables the first is div
01:54 - height and this is going to be equal to
01:57 - and we're going to reference or we're
01:59 - going to select this div and that's just
02:01 - called div so we can go ahead and say
02:03 - hashd and all we need to do is go ahead
02:05 - and apply the height property so
02:10 - uh yeah I knew I'd spell that wrong so
02:13 - yeah okay now we're going to go ahead
02:14 - and get the width so we do exactly the
02:17 - same thing uh but this time obviously uh
02:19 - it's quite easy to guess we would just
02:22 - apply width to the end so now I'm going
02:25 - to go ahead and output this to the div
02:27 - itself so div. text and in here I can go
02:32 - ahead and write something like
02:35 - um
02:41 - width width yeah that's right width x
02:44 - and or width
02:46 - x height X so X I'm just going to go
02:49 - ahead and replace with uh by appending
02:52 - this on uh and I'm going to replace the
02:55 - div width and I'm going to do the same
02:57 - with X so I can just append this on to
02:59 - the the end of this string uh and that
03:01 - is div height so this is obviously in
03:05 - pixels when we refresh you can see that
03:07 - we get a representation of the div width
03:10 - and the div height there are other ways
03:12 - to do this for example we could go ahead
03:14 - and use the CSS property uh so we could
03:17 - go ahead and use CSS here uh and then
03:20 - Supply or ask for the height and we
03:25 - could go ahead and then say
03:27 - CSS and then Supply width in there uh
03:31 - and what this will do is it will return
03:32 - more or less the same thing but you'll
03:34 - see that we'll get the PX on the end of
03:36 - it um and the there's two ways that why
03:39 - this is unreliable and may require more
03:42 - processing power uh the reason being is
03:45 - that for example if we were to uh use
03:48 - this and we wanted to use it as an
03:50 - integer this doesn't return it as an
03:52 - integer it only returns with uh the
03:54 - absolute value in the style. CSS file uh
03:58 - or the the CSS that's applied to it so
04:00 - what we would need to do is go ahead and
04:02 - use pass int now obviously the first uh
04:06 - downfall of this or the uh downside to
04:09 - this is that we're unnecessarily
04:12 - processing uh this uh and passing it as
04:15 - an integer and pass in it's just going
04:17 - to obviously pass the value as an
04:20 - integer and just go ahead and remove PX
04:23 - uh so we can we can do it that way but
04:25 - you know why write all this out when
04:28 - it's completely unnecessary uh and you
04:30 - could go ahead and use the width and
04:32 - height options uh like
04:35 - this and
04:37 - like this so uh the other reason that we
04:41 - would go ahead and do it like this is
04:44 - because we might not have predefined a
04:47 - uh a height and a width to this div for
04:50 - example the content might have filled up
04:52 - the div to the point where uh it's at a
04:55 - size that we haven't defined you know
04:56 - the content might not overlap but push
04:59 - the div and create more width or more
05:01 - height to it so using height and width
05:03 - will always return an integer which is
05:05 - one benefit less processing power uh and
05:08 - not having to use pass in and the other
05:10 - benefit is that it will get the height
05:12 - and the width reliably you know
05:14 - regardless of the content that we add so
05:16 - for example uh at the moment you can see
05:18 - it's width 250 and height 100 if I was
05:21 - to go ahead and inside of the div write
05:24 - um let's just say text and then break
05:28 - and let's just copy and paste this a few
05:31 - times and then in EXT change this to
05:35 - aend because we obviously don't want to
05:37 - rewrite over our content uh you can now
05:40 - see that oh okay yeah so right uh let's
05:45 - just go ahead and get rid of style in
05:47 - here so we have a div now that will just
05:49 - sort of like overflow the content uh you
05:52 - can now see that the you know the
05:54 - properties have changed for this we've
05:55 - got different width I'm not sure what oh
05:58 - that's just because it automatically
06:00 - went to the edge of the document
