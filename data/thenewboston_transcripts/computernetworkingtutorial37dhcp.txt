00:00 - all right guys so for the past couple
00:02 - videos we've been talking about IP
00:04 - addresses and subnets and right now we
00:07 - basically know that whenever we have a
00:09 - network any device on our Network it
00:13 - needs to have its own IP address and
00:15 - that's just essentially what it boils
00:17 - down to is a unique identification
00:19 - number so we can identify and manage
00:23 - every device all right so that's easy
00:26 - enough but here's the thing how do these
00:29 - numbers get assigned I mean I learned
00:31 - about subnets and I know that we're only
00:34 - allowed a specific range of IP addresses
00:37 - but I mean how do we determine which IP
00:39 - address gets assigned to which computer
00:42 - well we actually have a couple options
00:43 - of how we can do that one of course is
00:46 - just to do it manually so if we wanted
00:48 - to whenever we're starting a network we
00:51 - can actually sit down every device this
00:53 - laptop and say okay whatever IP
00:56 - addresses I'm allowed you can have this
00:57 - one like 1.2.3.4
01:00 - all right go to the next one all right
01:02 - you can have 1.2. 3.5 all right well if
01:05 - I ever you know sell this computer then
01:07 - I have to say Okay um so free that IP
01:10 - address up and I can you know use it
01:12 - somewhere else well all that is going to
01:14 - take a long time and of course whenever
01:17 - we just you know want to get on the
01:18 - internet at our house most people you
01:21 - know don't want to have to learn how to
01:22 - assign IP addresses to each device so
01:26 - instead what usually happens is all this
01:29 - is taken care of through a method called
01:31 - DH CP you guys have to excuse my
01:35 - handwriting because I haven't used this
01:37 - tablet in I don't know a few weeks and
01:40 - these things are actually really weird
01:42 - uh once you start like using them after
01:44 - you haven't used them in a while but uh
01:46 - nonetheless all right so DHCP this
01:49 - stands for dynamic host configuration
01:52 - protocol now long name but it's actually
01:55 - really easy all this protocol does is
01:59 - whenever you have a new device on your
02:00 - network or a device leaves it assigns it
02:04 - or what's the opposite of assign design
02:07 - no un assigns it um an IP address so
02:10 - basically all of this work that we would
02:12 - have to do manually assigning an IP
02:14 - address manually is taken care of
02:16 - automatically using DHCP now just as a
02:20 - side note you can actually have an
02:22 - entire server devoted to just this but
02:25 - you really don't need that unless you
02:27 - know you have a huge humongous Network
02:30 - um you know maybe if you had like a
02:31 - college or something that you would have
02:33 - a server just for
02:35 - DHCP most server operating systems have
02:38 - DHCP built in so if you want to just you
02:41 - know enable it then you can do that
02:44 - however just for a simple home network
02:46 - DHCP is built into most routers and
02:49 - usually users don't even have to worry
02:51 - about it because you know you plug in
02:52 - your router and it just works but I'm
02:54 - going to be showing you guys in this
02:56 - example of you know how a home network
02:59 - commun Ates using DHCP and how it
03:02 - automatically gets an IP address so let
03:04 - me what color am I going to use how this
03:07 - cool little red orange one all right so
03:10 - here are my computers already in my
03:13 - house these already have IP addresses
03:15 - already hooked up however I just got
03:17 - this computer Best
03:19 - Buy so I bring it home I boot it up turn
03:23 - it on and right now my computer knows
03:26 - nothing about this network right here
03:28 - it's a brand new computer doesn't know
03:30 - where the heck it is it doesn't have any
03:32 - IP address assigned to it so the very
03:35 - first thing that it's going to do is
03:37 - it's going to I'll write this down so
03:40 - it's going to send out a broadcast
03:42 - packet and it's called a DHCP discover
03:47 - message now you know how I talked to you
03:50 - guys about the special broadcast address
03:52 - that's assigned whenever you have you
03:53 - know your range of IP addresses that
03:55 - you're allowed to use what this address
03:57 - essentially does is it takes message and
04:00 - it sends it out to everyone it possibly
04:03 - can now it only needs to talk to the
04:05 - router but it doesn't know that yet it
04:07 - you know pretty much knows nothing about
04:09 - the network so this discover
04:12 - message it's pretty much the equivalent
04:15 - of your laptop shout shouting out hey
04:17 - someone I'm here I need an IP address
04:20 - someone please help me so that's what it
04:23 - is and for the source it uses
04:26 - 0.0.0.0 so your default IP address
04:30 - before you have an actual one assign is
04:32 - just 000000 Z that means whenever anyone
04:36 - gets this message and send it back just
04:38 - broadcast it out shout it out to anyone
04:40 - so that's the return address and the
04:43 - next thing that happens let me pick a
04:45 - new color here all right so whenever
04:47 - your router hears this what it does is
04:50 - it sends
04:52 - back a DHCP
04:55 - offer so it says okay I heard that
04:58 - someone said they need an IP address
04:59 - address what I'm going to do is this I
05:02 - am going to look through all of the IP
05:05 - addresses that I have and if I have one
05:08 - that's available then I'm going to say
05:10 - okay here's an IP address that you can
05:12 - use let me know if you want it so that's
05:15 - what the offer messag is basically the
05:18 - router or whatever DHCP system you have
05:21 - is going to find an available IP address
05:24 - and it's going to send it back and
05:26 - remember your laptop it doesn't have a
05:29 - valid IP address so this is going to be
05:30 - sent over broadcast 2 so right now you
05:34 - know these computers are pretty much
05:35 - just shouting at each other back and
05:36 - forth that's the you know digital
05:38 - equivalent of it but that's what's going
05:40 - on so whenever the hardest part of this
05:44 - tutorial is actually just picking the
05:45 - colors I want to use all right getting
05:48 - kind of sidetracked here so your laptop
05:51 - receives an IP address let's say 1.
05:55 - 2.3.8 this one's available your laptop's
05:58 - going to look at it in it's going to
06:00 - send
06:01 - back after it reviews it something
06:03 - called a DHCP
06:06 - request
06:08 - message so it looks at the available IP
06:12 - and it's pretty much saying yeah that
06:14 - looks good can I have it please now the
06:16 - last part of this equation and I'm kind
06:19 - of running out of space here but once
06:20 - the router hears that's okay the laptop
06:24 - looked at the IP it said it was cool it
06:26 - said you know it wanted to use it it's
06:29 - going to send back and act so a c k so
06:33 - the router is going to say okay um sure
06:36 - it's all yours and also here's some
06:38 - other information that you can use too
06:41 - and it sends it not only um the IP but
06:43 - also things like the subnet mask and how
06:47 - long the IP can actually be uh leased
06:49 - for and you know the router's IP and
06:52 - just a bunch of other information that
06:54 - it needs to be configured on the network
06:58 - so the laptops receives it and
07:00 - configures it to connect to the network
07:02 - and boom you're good but essentially all
07:04 - of this happens behind the scenes and
07:08 - that's why whenever you just plug in
07:09 - your Wi-Fi router you're usually good to
07:11 - go so again anytime you're at home and
07:14 - you connect a device to get on the
07:16 - internet what's going to happen is it's
07:18 - first going to say hey anyone who's
07:20 - listening I need an IP address someone
07:23 - help me out and your router is going to
07:25 - go hey I got this available one let me
07:27 - know if you want it and you're laptop's
07:29 - going to go yeah that looks cool I'll
07:32 - take that one and then your Wi-Fi router
07:35 - goes okay here's all the information
07:37 - that you need to connect and it also
07:39 - takes care of some other things like
07:41 - whenever a device disconnects from the
07:43 - network then it automatically frees up
07:45 - the IP so someone else can use it but
07:47 - there you go now you guys know the
07:49 - basics of DHCP incredibly thrilling I
07:52 - know but uh yeah hopefully you guys
07:54 - enjoyed see you guys next time
