00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' no org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this tutorial we're going to be
00:06 - taking a look at the date picker widget
00:08 - in the jQuery UI now we can bind the
00:12 - date picker to a particular form field
00:15 - so make it easier for us functionality
00:19 - wise to allow our users to pick a date
00:21 - by clicking an input field so at the
00:24 - moment there's nothing on my browser and
00:26 - the first thing I'm going to go ahead
00:27 - and do is create an a input field a text
00:30 - input field so let's go over to our text
00:34 - editor and create an input field and I'm
00:39 - going to give this a type text I'm going
00:41 - to slightly reduce the size to 8 just so
00:44 - the date will fit nicely in there and we
00:46 - don't have too much white space left and
00:47 - I'm then going to go ahead and give this
00:50 - an ID so I'm going to call this date so
00:53 - in our browser now we have a input field
00:55 - which our user is going to click on and
00:58 - they're going to show is going to show a
01:00 - date picker the date picker widget now
01:04 - because we can actually bind the date
01:06 - picker widget to this input field
01:07 - there's no need to create a separate
01:09 - area that will handle this jQuery UI
01:12 - will handle this for us it will actually
01:15 - show the date picker just below the
01:18 - field that we actually click on so let's
01:22 - go back over to our text editor the
01:24 - first thing we're going to do is reduce
01:26 - the overall font size on the page and
01:28 - this is because by default the theming
01:30 - will create a the you know the default
01:33 - font size and we want to create a
01:34 - standard font size on our page in order
01:37 - to show this properly so I'm just going
01:40 - to specify it in body the front size to
01:42 - be 10 pixels ok so now we want to
01:45 - actually append the date picker widget
01:49 - to this field and it will automatically
01:51 - show when we actually click on the input
01:54 - field now when the date picker is shown
01:56 - and we click away from this it will
01:58 - actually remove it so we don't need to
02:00 - handle any of the action ourselves oh as
02:03 - well as that when we actually click on a
02:04 - date the date will automatically be
02:06 - inserted into the field so it's
02:08 - extremely easy to implement
02:11 - so what we need to do is we need to use
02:13 - a selector to select this date here
02:15 - which is the our input field so date and
02:18 - all we need to do is bind on the widget
02:21 - so this is just date picker now by
02:24 - default without specifying any options
02:26 - within our curly brackets as we usually
02:28 - would with widgets and interactions we
02:31 - actually have the functionality now
02:33 - existing within this input field so now
02:36 - when we click on the input field we
02:38 - automatically get this date picker up
02:40 - now we can browse dates and it's fully
02:42 - functional ready to use let's just go
02:45 - ahead and click on site tomorrow which
02:47 - is the 29th of July 2011 when we click
02:51 - on this you'll notice that the date is
02:53 - automatically inserted into the field
02:55 - now if we want to go back and change
02:57 - this we can then go ahead and click back
02:59 - on the field and change this to a
03:01 - different day so it will automatically
03:03 - update the date we choose so now that
03:06 - we've established the functionality and
03:08 - the working of the date picker this is
03:11 - suitable to go into a normal form so for
03:14 - example if you were to take a date in a
03:16 - form field you'd be able to implement
03:19 - the date picker and it would
03:20 - automatically put this text in there
03:22 - when you were when you say go ahead and
03:24 - press a submit button this will be
03:26 - submitted along with the rest of the
03:28 - data in your form so obviously we're not
03:30 - going to go through actually creating a
03:32 - form and submitting anything but I'm
03:34 - going to show you a few options that
03:35 - might help you depending on date formats
03:38 - and available dates so at the moment
03:41 - when we click on it we have this format
03:43 - which is the month the day and then the
03:45 - year now let's just say we wanted to go
03:48 - ahead and change the day to the first
03:50 - element of this day so we wanted it to
03:52 - read the 29th of the 7th 2011 so we can
03:57 - do this by specifying the date format
04:00 - option so date format we can now choose
04:04 - a textual representation of a date that
04:06 - we want to implement or we want the date
04:09 - picker widget to implement for us so at
04:12 - the moment it's set to mm DD YY so let's
04:16 - just go back and see that that looks
04:17 - exactly the same you can see that we've
04:19 - got exactly the same
04:22 - functionality exists in hand in the same
04:24 - date format but we can obviously then
04:26 - just go around and change this so we can
04:28 - change it to the day the month and then
04:31 - the year so now what's going to happen
04:33 - is when we click on say the 29th of July
04:36 - 2011 we now show the date first then the
04:39 - month then the year different countries
04:42 - have different ways of displaying dates
04:44 - by default and more recognizable to the
04:47 - UK it's the date first then the month so
04:50 - depending on sort of like localization
04:52 - you can go ahead and change this to suit
04:55 - your needs
04:55 - now you don't just need to use slashes
04:57 - you can go ahead and implement hyphens
05:00 - into this as well also depending on how
05:02 - you wanted the date to be shown so you
05:04 - can now see that we've got hyphens
05:06 - instead of slashes you could obviously
05:08 - even then go ahead and do just spaces
05:11 - for example and this would work in
05:14 - exactly the same way however usually
05:16 - with databases database tables you would
05:19 - submit a date with slashes it's entirely
05:23 - preference
