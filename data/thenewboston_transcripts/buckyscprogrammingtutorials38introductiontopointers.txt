00:00 - all right guys welcome back to your 38th
00:02 - C++ tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
00:04 - going to be beginning to talk about
00:06 - something called pointers now pointers
00:09 - is something that confuses a lot of
00:11 - people so I'm going to try to explain it
00:13 - really simple for you guys now you
00:16 - remember how we made some variables that
00:18 - contain strings of text and we made some
00:20 - variables that contain integers and we
00:23 - made some variables that contain floats
00:26 - well a pointer is a special type of
00:28 - variable that contains a memory address
00:31 - as their value pretty weird huh so let's
00:33 - go ahead and uh the first thing we need
00:35 - is a plain old integer variable so let's
00:38 - go ahead and make a variable called fish
00:39 - and set it equal to the value of five it
00:42 - doesn't really matter what what the
00:43 - value is to be honest so anyways we have
00:46 - a plain old variable named fish now let
00:50 - let me go ahead and show you guys how to
00:52 - retrieve the memory address of this
00:54 - variable so as you probably already know
00:57 - this variable called fish is stored
00:59 - somewhere where on our computer
01:01 - somewhere in the memory you know who
01:04 - knows where so sometimes we need to be
01:06 - able to access where indeed that memory
01:10 - is so in order to do that you go ahead
01:13 - and you write the and sign and the and
01:15 - sign is called the address operator and
01:18 - now whatever variable you type after it
01:20 - this means the address in your memory of
01:23 - a fish so if you go ahead and print this
01:25 - out on the screen using C out and might
01:28 - as well end that line
01:31 - hello can't type endline today n l there
01:34 - we go and we go ahead and build and run
01:36 - this we see that we get this weird
01:38 - heximal who knows what this is this is
01:41 - actually the memory address of where the
01:44 - variable fish is so again like I said
01:48 - the first thing we need to find the
01:50 - address of something is of course a
01:51 - variable because we need to find the
01:53 - address of something and in order to
01:55 - find the memory address of the variable
01:57 - you go ahead and you write the and sign
02:00 - right before the variable and then those
02:03 - two combined pretty much tell your C++
02:05 - compiler all right I want to print out
02:07 - the memory address of fish not the
02:10 - variable fish itself so this is of
02:13 - course the address of where your
02:15 - variable fish lives now you're saying
02:17 - all right well you just went over
02:20 - address operators I thought you were
02:21 - going to go over something called
02:22 - pointers well let's get into that right
02:25 - now a pointer like I said is a special
02:28 - type of variable that points to a memory
02:31 - address in other words um a pointer is a
02:35 - variable that contains a memory address
02:37 - as a value so let's go ahead and I'll
02:39 - show you guys how to make a pointer in
02:41 - order to make a pointer go ahead and
02:43 - write the type of data you're going to
02:45 - be pointing to so we're going to make a
02:47 - pointer that points to an INT value or
02:49 - in other words an INT variable so this
02:51 - is going to be an in pointer simple
02:53 - enough now in order to tell uh C++ we're
02:57 - making a pointer instead of just another
02:59 - variable we need to add an asterisk that
03:02 - little uh star above the eight on your
03:04 - keyboard and now we can go ahead and
03:07 - name a variable like fish pointer and
03:10 - this tells our compiler that we're going
03:11 - to be making a pointer instead of a
03:13 - regular variable again if we just had it
03:15 - like that uh our compiler would think
03:18 - that we're just making a regular
03:19 - variable but we're not we're making a
03:21 - pointer so that's why we needed that
03:23 - little asteris before fish pointer so we
03:26 - went ahead and we declared a fish
03:29 - pointer right here we're pretty much
03:31 - telling our program we're going to be
03:33 - making a pointer called fish pointer and
03:36 - what this fish pointer is going to do is
03:38 - it's going to point to a memory address
03:41 - so now we have to of course assign it a
03:44 - memory address so let's go ahead
03:46 - and whenever you assign a memory address
03:50 - to a pointer you don't need to include
03:52 - the star again because you only do that
03:55 - whenever you're first creating the
03:56 - variable from now on whenever you use
03:58 - the variable fish pointer
04:00 - C++ already knows that it's a pointer
04:02 - because you told it whenever you created
04:04 - the variable so make sure you don't put
04:06 - star fish pointer twice only one time
04:09 - C++ is smart enough to recognize this
04:11 - now go ahead and set it equal to the
04:14 - memory address of a variable and we only
04:16 - got one variable fish so now fish
04:20 - pointer is equal to the memory address
04:23 - of fish it isn't equal to five it isn't
04:26 - equal to the word fish fish pointer is
04:29 - is equal to the memory address of where
04:32 - the variable fish lives that long
04:34 - heximal thing so now when we go ahead
04:37 - and see out print fish pointer and go
04:42 - ahead and end that line now these two
04:44 - lines should be identical because first
04:46 - we're printing out the memory address of
04:49 - fish and next we just are basically
04:52 - printing out the memory address of fish
04:53 - so let's go ahead and make sure these
04:55 - lines are the same so I don't look like
04:56 - a fool and see there we go
05:00 - so
05:01 - basically we know how to print out the
05:04 - memory address of a variable using the
05:06 - memory address operator that's a pretty
05:08 - nice name for it so then I taught you
05:11 - guys how to create a pointer and all a
05:13 - pointer was was a special type of
05:15 - variable that had a memory address as
05:18 - its value so again whenever we ran this
05:21 - we can't assign this to an INT because
05:23 - it's not an integer we can't assign it
05:25 - to a float because it's obviously not a
05:27 - float so we have to assign it to a
05:29 - special type of variable called a
05:30 - pointer so that's why you need to be
05:32 - able to use pointers and of course when
05:34 - we just printed it out it printed out
05:36 - the memory address pretty cool huh so
05:39 - that is your basics of what a pointer is
05:42 - how they're created and how you obtain
05:44 - the memory address of a variable so now
05:47 - with all that knowledge we can begin
05:50 - programming and we're actually going to
05:52 - use these pointers and programs and
05:54 - they're actually useful for something
05:56 - Believe it or believe it or not so thank
05:58 - you guys for watching hopefully you
05:59 - understand everything in this tutorial
06:01 - if you have any questions don't forget
06:02 - to check out my website the new
06:03 - boston.com and uh I see you guys in the
06:06 - next tutorial
