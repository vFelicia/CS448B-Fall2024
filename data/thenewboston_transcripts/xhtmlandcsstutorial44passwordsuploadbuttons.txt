00:00 - what's going on guys welcome back to
00:02 - your 44th xhtml and CSS tutorial your
00:06 - 44th tutorial that is a lot of tutorials
00:10 - I bet if you took all these videos and
00:12 - strung them together then you can make a
00:14 - full length movie but then again who the
00:17 - heck would want to watch a movie about
00:18 - this I wouldn't even watch a movie about
00:20 - this but anyways in this tutorial we're
00:22 - going to be covering two different types
00:24 - of input Fields the first one is the
00:26 - password and the second one is the file
00:29 - field and that's how you upload files
00:31 - for example if you want to make a
00:32 - website like Facebook or something and
00:34 - you wanted users to be able to upload
00:36 - files of pictures of them get wasted and
00:39 - then uh you know doing illegal things
00:41 - that their bosses shouldn't see this is
00:43 - what you would do so let's first of all
00:45 - learn how to do the password field so go
00:47 - ahead and type password right like that
00:50 - and now of course we need the same input
00:54 - tag as before and go ahead and end it
00:56 - right now but instead of text or uh you
00:59 - know text area for type we're going to
01:01 - go ahead and put password in there and
01:03 - whenever we do that and whenever this
01:05 - field appears on our screen it's a
01:08 - little different than a text but it has
01:10 - all the same attributes it's the same in
01:12 - the sense that you can use you know size
01:15 - max length just like you could do text
01:17 - but it's different in that whenever you
01:20 - type in it it either gives you little
01:21 - bullets or little asterisks that cover
01:23 - up what you're really typing that way
01:25 - whenever you're logging on to YouTube at
01:27 - school and you should be working the
01:29 - students behind you can't see what your
01:30 - password is so anyways the type is
01:33 - password and the name again that's what
01:36 - is going to come in handy whenever we're
01:38 - programming this data uh with JavaScript
01:40 - or PHP but just put like PW that looks
01:43 - good enough so let's go ahead and
01:45 - actually save this right now and see
01:46 - what it looks like you see it looks a
01:48 - lot like the text area at first but
01:50 - whenever we start typing in it we get
01:52 - all those bullet point asterisks pretty
01:54 - cool so again like I mentioned before we
01:57 - can also have the size and max length to
01:59 - this so so if you ever decide that you
02:00 - want to change it up a bit or you want
02:02 - to restrict them from entering a
02:04 - password that's like 80 characters long
02:06 - you can use that max length so anyways
02:09 - now that we know how to do the password
02:10 - just go ahead and actually add a
02:13 - paragraph right
02:16 - here and just uh put something like now
02:20 - submit a file cuz we're going to be
02:22 - working with a file input next and we
02:24 - want to give them a little input of what
02:26 - to do so go ahead and add a paragraph
02:28 - just give us some spacing and and now we
02:30 - are ready to begin so crack your
02:32 - knuckles and check it out so the tag for
02:35 - this is of course input who would have
02:38 - guessed and the type is actually
02:41 - file Now it only has one other attribute
02:45 - and it's required and it's actually the
02:47 - name this way if you have more than one
02:50 - file upload sections whenever you're
02:53 - working with it programming it your
02:55 - program can differentiate between which
02:57 - file is which so just go ahead and name
02:59 - this buy file it doesn't really matter
03:01 - because we're not going to be working
03:02 - with this attribute for now the main
03:04 - thing you have to concentrate is make
03:05 - sure that the type is filed now let's go
03:08 - ahead and save this and see what happens
03:10 - whenever we refresh our page it gives us
03:12 - a little button and whenever we click
03:15 - that button it opens up our Windows
03:17 - Explorer whatever heck this thing is
03:19 - called and it allows us to choose a file
03:21 - so we can choose a file by either double
03:23 - clicking it or just hit open and then we
03:26 - don't have a submit button yet because I
03:27 - didn't teach you guys about that but
03:29 - when every we do and they hit submit it
03:31 - allows us or excuse me it allows them
03:34 - rather to upload their file to the web
03:36 - server so that way they can transfer
03:38 - their pictures onto the web or you know
03:41 - maybe if you have to submit homework for
03:43 - a class and a teacher might include this
03:45 - in their web page something like that
03:48 - but anyways that's basically all there
03:50 - is to cover with file uploads again I
03:53 - said that those are the only two
03:55 - attributes because you don't really have
03:57 - a size attribute cuz that doesn't really
03:59 - Mak sense you don't have a max length
04:02 - because that doesn't really make sense
04:03 - the only thing that you might be
04:05 - wondering is all right I don't want them
04:07 - uploading a file that's like a th000
04:09 - gigabytes big so if you want to restrict
04:13 - this you can't do this using strictly
04:14 - xhtml you need to do this whenever you
04:17 - learn um JavaScript PHP all those other
04:20 - scripting languages that you guys might
04:22 - know but you probably don't know yet so
04:24 - um you're going to have to stick with my
04:26 - other tutorials if you want to learn how
04:27 - to do that but for now this is all you
04:29 - have have to remember and don't forget
04:32 - you can't use size or max length and
04:34 - also if you want to upload multiple
04:36 - files you can't click this button once
04:38 - right here and you can't choose a bunch
04:39 - of files if you want to upload multiple
04:42 - files you have to give them multiple
04:43 - buttons it's a little different than a
04:45 - regular program but that's what xhtml
04:48 - did so whoever making xhtml blame them
04:52 - they made the rules not me so anyways
04:54 - that's all I have for you guys for this
04:55 - lesson um I'm going to go check the
04:58 - score of the basketball game and then
04:59 - the next video I'll let you guys know
05:01 - who won so thank you guys for watching
05:02 - and I'll see you next video
