02:06 - they let you
02:08 - have these games where you start off
02:10 - with like a hundred thousand dollars and
02:12 - it's pretty much like pretend stock
02:14 - trading but you use the real stock
02:16 - market and it pretty much gives you fake
02:18 - money and it's like a stock market
02:20 - simulator so anyways i made a game
02:23 - called bucky's game so if you sign up
02:25 - for investopedia.com
02:27 - and whenever you're searching a game
02:28 - type in bucky's game without any
02:30 - apostrophes or anything like that then

02:34 - play against me and every anyone else
02:36 - who signs up for it and it like i said
02:39 - you're gonna start off with a hundred
02:40 - thousand dollars and pretty much trade
02:42 - stocks and see how much money you can
02:44 - make so if you ever wanted to you know
02:47 - get into stock trading but you don't
02:48 - have any money um
02:51 - go ahead and join my game and maybe i'll
02:53 - give out like prizes or something at the
02:55 - end whoever wins the most money in the
02:57 - stock market but um

03:16 - like the last few months and i was gonna
03:18 - make one tonight and i was gonna talk
03:21 - about inheritance but i couldn't figure
03:23 - out if i covered inheritance before or
03:26 - not so instead of looking through my
03:28 - videos to see if i covered it or not
03:30 - because that will definitely take like
03:32 - four seconds and i do not have that time
03:35 - i'm a busy man i got things to do let me
03:37 - know if i covered inheritance or not and
03:39 - if not i'll make a tutorial about it if

03:45 - guys about is
03:49 - my computer doing a bunch of crazy stuff
03:52 - the last thing i want to talk to you
03:53 - guys about is
03:55 - a video series that i'm thinking of

03:59 - what i'm thinking about doing is for
04:01 - those of you who have watched us
04:03 - surviving the wilderness series i'm
04:06 - thinking about doing it myself in either
04:08 - the adirondack mountains or great smoky
04:11 - mountain national park so if you would
04:14 - like to see me in a surviving the
04:16 - wilderness series and for those of you
04:18 - don't know it's pretty much you go out
04:20 - with i think it's a knife
04:22 - a flint and a machete and see how long
04:25 - you can last in the woods no
04:27 - cell phone no gps no
04:30 - i don't know no food no tent nothing
04:34 - like that it's pretty much you have a
04:35 - knife and you see how long you can last
