00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - talking about enumerations
00:09 - now if you remember from all of the
00:11 - previous tutorials we've been using
00:13 - variables now these pretty much have no
00:17 - limit except for integer has a limit of
00:19 - I think for billions of them so there is
00:23 - a limit there but you can pretty much
00:25 - put whatever you want into it now let's
00:27 - say you want to limit a user so that
00:29 - they can only put a certain value in so
00:33 - let's say if you want them to tell you
00:34 - how many doors that car has you wouldn't
00:37 - want them to be able to put 523 because
00:40 - that's impossible so the way you can do
00:43 - get around this is by using enumerations
00:45 - and what enumerations is is pretty much
00:48 - creating your own data type and you can
00:50 - create as many variables as you want
00:52 - based off of that enumeration so let's
00:55 - go ahead and create a project and we'll
00:58 - give this a little practice
01:00 - so go ahead we'll go to new project we
01:05 - will select windows forms application
01:06 - and we will call it enumerations and
01:11 - we'll go ahead and click OK now we'll
01:14 - wait for this to load ok so now let's go
01:17 - ahead and we will come over here to our
01:22 - tool box we'll add a button and we will
01:26 - just set the text to enumeration and
01:31 - we'll go ahead and set the name to
01:33 - button enumeration
01:39 - okay so let's go ahead and open up the
01:41 - code for forum one and now what we're
01:45 - going to do is we're going to create an
01:47 - enumeration now to do this we're going
01:50 - to declare like we would a method or a
01:54 - function by starting off with the
01:56 - keyword public or private so this guy
01:59 - case will do private so private and then
02:03 - we're going to use the keyword enum for
02:05 - enumeration and now we have to create a
02:08 - name for it so let's just call it day
02:10 - action and you see it gets that light
02:12 - blue color and they actually we're going
02:15 - to be using that in the upcoming
02:16 - tutorials we're going to be learning
02:17 - several different things and we're going
02:19 - to use them all in one application
02:20 - so private in um day action and then
02:23 - we'll type as integer you have to
02:26 - specify a data type for that and now go
02:29 - ahead and press enter now we have to
02:32 - populate our enumerations with possible
02:34 - values so we'll just type awake equals
02:40 - zero asleep equals one and let's just do
02:48 - coding equals two okay so now we can
02:54 - create a variable based off of this day
02:57 - action such as we would make a variable
02:59 - that's an integer value so instead of
03:02 - doing private action as integer and set
03:09 - a value to that we would do it as day
03:11 - action now we can make as many of these
03:13 - as we want and they will each be their
03:16 - own separate things holding different
03:17 - values so now what do we want to do
03:20 - we'll go ahead and set that equal to two
03:23 - which is going to be coding so we'll go
03:26 - ahead and create a click event for
03:27 - button enumeration and we'll go ahead
03:31 - and show what action is currently being
03:35 - performed so we'll type message box dot
03:39 - show action dot to string
03:44 - so if we go ahead and run this we're
03:47 - going to get form one right here and
03:49 - when we click enumeration it says coding
03:52 - now we can set de action to different
03:55 - values as well
03:58 - so if we'll give this a little bit of
04:00 - time to load so we'll set it equal to
04:04 - one and it should give us asleep so if
04:07 - we go ahead and run this and click
04:08 - enumeration we get asleep now you don't
04:13 - have to set it to an integer value or
04:16 - let's say you create an enumeration as a
04:18 - string or anything else so you would
04:20 - have we have all of these names right
04:22 - here for the possible values so instead
04:24 - of actually putting in the integer which
04:26 - we may not know what it equals so if we
04:29 - put in 0 we will what if we don't know
04:30 - that means awake so what we can do is
04:33 - type day action and you can see here
04:37 - down in intellisense it gives us several
04:40 - options so we can do a day action dot we
04:43 - can do a sleep awake and coding so if we
04:46 - click awake action is going to be equal
04:50 - to zero and it's going to be equal to
04:52 - awake so to set it equal to something
04:55 - that you want that is the name in your
04:57 - enumeration you type the name of your
05:00 - enumeration dot and then whatever you
05:03 - name you have for that certain value so
05:06 - if we go ahead and run this we'll go
05:09 - ahead and click enumeration and we get
05:11 - awake so go ahead and practice with the
05:14 - numeration x' make some that are other
05:16 - datatypes besides an integer they may be
05:18 - a little confusing at first they were
05:20 - for me it's kind of a little bit hard
05:22 - concept to grasp I fear a new programmer
05:25 - so I'm go ahead and practice with those
05:28 - and we're going to be using in the next
05:29 - upcoming tutorials so just get used to
05:33 - them so you won't be confused in the
05:34 - next tutorial and thanks for watching
