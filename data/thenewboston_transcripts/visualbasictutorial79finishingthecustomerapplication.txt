00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - finishing our customer application and
00:10 - then after this tutorial we're going to
00:11 - be um simplifying things a little bit
00:14 - and just be looking at arrays them array
00:17 - lists themselves and some of the stuff
00:19 - that you can do with array
00:21 - list so um if you remember from from the
00:24 - last tutorial we made this right here
00:26 - and we overrided the two string function
00:28 - so that when we click list customer it
00:30 - gives us the information that we want
00:32 - now if you don't know what I'm talking
00:33 - about go ahead and move back to one of
00:35 - the earlier tutorials and you should see
00:38 - how we did this now um what we're going
00:41 - to do in this program is whenever the
00:43 - user selects one of these it's going to
00:45 - automatically fill in these fields right
00:47 - here uh with the selected
00:51 - information so what we'll do is uh we'll
00:53 - come back here in our code and if you
00:56 - remember we created this display
00:58 - customer sub right here
01:00 - and what it does is we pass a customer
01:03 - object to it which is a structure and
01:06 - then we set the text of text name to the
01:09 - customer they that they passed and then
01:12 - the name uh property then we need the
01:15 - first name uh the last name and the
01:17 - email all of the same customer structure
01:20 - and we set them to text first name text
01:22 - last name text email and text name which
01:24 - are these text boxes right
01:26 - here so now what we're going to do is
01:29 - we're going to come over here and we're
01:30 - going to select our list customers uh
01:33 - list box and we're going to be working
01:35 - with some of the events so if you click
01:37 - the lightning bolt it will open up the
01:39 - events for
01:40 - you and uh you can see that we've got a
01:43 - whole bunch right here and what we want
01:45 - to do is we want to uh select selected
01:48 - index change so I'll just double click
01:50 - on that and it'll create this sub for us
01:53 - so now inside this sub um we are just
01:56 - going to reuse code that we've already
01:58 - created display C customer and this is
02:01 - why subs and functions are so useful cuz
02:03 - you can reuse the code in different ways
02:05 - that you may not think of at first and
02:07 - uh it makes programming a lot faster and
02:09 - a lot easier so um what we're going to
02:12 - do is we're going to call display
02:15 - customer and we're just going to pass
02:17 - the customer that the user has
02:20 - selected now to do this we're going to
02:22 - have to create a property so we'll come
02:25 - up
02:26 - here and let's just get some of this
02:29 - code out of the way so it doesn't
02:30 - confuse
02:31 - you and let's just do it right above
02:33 - list customers so what we're going to do
02:36 - is we're going to type private and we're
02:38 - going to make this property read only
02:40 - because you're not going to have to do
02:42 - any changing of values so we'll type
02:45 - read
02:46 - only property and we're just going to
02:49 - call this selected
02:52 - customer and the type is going to be the
02:55 - customer type so it is um we use the
03:00 - customer type and it's a readon property
03:03 - so now what we're going to do is we are
03:05 - going to get the current index that is
03:09 - selected and we're going to try and
03:11 - convert that to a customer object now it
03:14 - will work every time because it's not
03:15 - possible for them to add uh any other
03:18 - items to the list that aren't customers
03:20 - so what we're going to do is we're going
03:21 - to type return and what we're going to
03:25 - do is we're going to take the selected
03:28 - uh customer that they have in the list
03:30 - box and we're going to convert that to a
03:33 - uh type customer so what we're going to
03:35 - do is we're going to use C type which we
03:37 - have learned in earlier tutorials so now
03:41 - what we're going to do is we're going to
03:42 - type object
03:46 - customers okay sorry about that we're
03:48 - going to use my customers instead of
03:50 - object customers now my customers is our
03:53 - array list that we have here so what
03:56 - we're going to do is we're going to
03:57 - access an index of that array list
04:00 - now since everything added to our list
04:03 - is by index um let's see let's just
04:07 - comment this thing out real quick okay
04:10 - so since everything that we added ah oh
04:15 - yeah just comment that out
04:17 - too okay everything that we added is by
04:20 - index so this right here is of index
04:22 - zero this right here is of index one and
04:25 - this right here is of index 2 um and
04:27 - this is of the array list so index0 one
04:30 - and two and it is the same uh in the
04:33 - list box uh we got lucky with this so
04:36 - the list box this is index zero this is
04:38 - index one and this is index two so
04:40 - they're going to be the same so we can
04:41 - get the index of the selected item in
04:44 - our list box and we can use that index
04:46 - in the index of our array list now this
04:49 - might be a little confusing but um we'll
04:51 - go ahead and type this out so you'll see
04:52 - what I mean so we're going to
04:56 - use contrl Z and we'll uncom comment it
05:00 - so we're going to use the index that is
05:01 - selected in our list box so we'll just
05:03 - type list
05:06 - customers do
05:08 - selected index so what it's going to do
05:13 - is if they select index Zer which is Sam
05:17 - it's going to get the um item in the
05:20 - array list my customers at the index of
05:22 - zero which is going to be
05:25 - Sam and so we're going to get that and
05:28 - we are going to try and convert that to
05:30 - the type customer so we'll just type
05:34 - customer and that is our second argument
05:36 - because we're trying to convert it to a
05:37 - customer but what if they haven't
05:40 - selected a or what if they selected
05:43 - index NE uh Nega 1 or um no index at all
05:47 - cuz it starts at zero and if the index
05:50 - is negative 1 that means nothing has
05:51 - started so we can just prevent an error
05:54 - from happening by typing if lists
05:58 - customers
06:00 - do selected index does not equal ne1 so
06:05 - if it doesn't equal negative 1 then it's
06:07 - going to go ahead and return this right
06:09 - here and we will go ahead and end if
06:12 - okay so now what we're going to do is
06:13 - we're going to come down here and we're
06:15 - going to uncomment this
06:17 - code so we're just going to go ahead and
06:20 - type display customer and then selected
06:23 - customer so what this is going to
06:26 - do is um
06:30 - get the current selected customer so
06:32 - it's going to uh select customer is
06:35 - going to be equal to um the customer at
06:39 - the index of whatever you've
06:41 - selected so and then display customer
06:44 - will add the name the first name last
06:47 - name and email to these text boxes so
06:49 - let's go ahead and run this and see what
06:53 - happens we go ahead and click list
06:56 - customers and if we select one of these
06:58 - here you can see that it adds them to
07:01 - these text boxes right
07:03 - here
