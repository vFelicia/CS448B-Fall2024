00:00 - already houses so now that we got our
00:02 - edit functionality and remove
00:04 - functionality working correctly the last
00:06 - thing I want to do is I would just want
00:08 - to add a quick button to add a new
00:10 - comment so let me go ahead and in my
00:13 - board I just go ahead and add it right
00:16 - above the board so since we're going to
00:20 - add a button and still have this board
00:22 - we actually need to wrap those both
00:24 - inside one parent div so let me stick my
00:31 - board back in there and let me just put
00:33 - fun alright so on the button I'll just
00:37 - write add new so we'll have a button
00:39 - right at the top and whenever the user
00:41 - clicks it it'll just give them um like a
00:44 - blank one or maybe we'll add some
00:45 - default text in there who knows and I
00:48 - already have some styling built in so
00:50 - I'll say class name I'm going to make a
00:53 - purple so that's button info again this
00:56 - isn't any react stuff it's just to make
00:58 - it a look kind of fancy and great so
01:03 - again this just makes a purple button
01:05 - and I can actually render this out right
01:06 - now alright so there you go when you
01:09 - click it nothing happens
01:11 - plain old dumb button so what else do I
01:14 - want to do what I'm going to do is I'm
01:17 - actually going to remove all of these by
01:18 - default so at first we're actually not
01:21 - even going to have any comments
01:24 - whatsoever so whenever the user wants a
01:27 - new one they're going to have to click
01:28 - this button alright so what might be a
01:31 - good idea to right now is that make a
01:33 - function to add a new comment why not
01:36 - name it ad so function boom roasted now
01:42 - actually whenever I do this I'm going to
01:45 - add some default text in there so we
01:47 - just don't have blank comments or else
01:49 - they'll look kind of weird and yeah so
01:52 - this is going to be the text that we're
01:53 - going to set essentially to this array
01:56 - item so just like before what we're
02:00 - going to be doing is pretty much taking
02:01 - a string of text and adding it to this
02:03 - array so we need a reference to this
02:05 - array we're going to make a copy of it
02:08 - and then for that copy we're just going
02:11 - to add a new item
02:13 - so push is how you add a new item to an
02:16 - array in JavaScript and what text we
02:18 - want to use just this right here so the
02:21 - very first time we call this it's going
02:25 - to have a string of text in here that
02:27 - says like I love Bucky or I love ice
02:29 - cream sandwiches whatever and just like
02:31 - before since we need to update the state
02:36 - then we're going to update the comment
02:38 - state using the new array boom roasted
02:41 - how easy was that so now the last bit of
02:44 - code we have to write is we have this
02:47 - function right here now we actually just
02:49 - have to hook it up to this button so how
02:52 - do we do that well over an hour button
02:55 - what we do is we just write on click hey
02:59 - how it does that on click just like that
03:02 - and set it equal to this dot add now one
03:08 - other thing I want to mention is this
03:09 - whenever you call in this kind of way
03:12 - since JavaScript can't really figure out
03:14 - scope yet you need to call bind so this
03:17 - is actually how you pass some values or
03:20 - text in right here so what we're going
03:24 - to bind is just a no object in the
03:26 - default text is pretty much the text
03:29 - that's going to appear on the button so
03:30 - I'll write I'll write something that's
03:32 - like baking food and I'll spell it wrong
03:35 - why not so basically whatever you type
03:37 - here is going to be the default text and
03:39 - of course the user can edit that later
03:42 - so let me refresh this and new and there
03:46 - you go there's our default text I just
03:48 - didn't want to write default text
03:49 - because I want to show you guys that you
03:52 - can like customize this default text
03:54 - let's do it properly now all right so
03:59 - you add it we now have a new array item
04:02 - aka a new comment and the user can edit
04:04 - this bacon they can add a few more tuna
04:11 - fish
04:12 - and you know what I actually didn't even
04:14 - want this one so I can go ahead and
04:16 - remove that
04:16 - boom roasted there you go so that ladies
04:20 - or gentlemen is probably all I'm going
04:22 - to do for this little note program
04:23 - there's a lot more react to toriel's
04:25 - that I'm going to cover but they're
04:28 - going to be set up a little bit
04:29 - differently and for example
04:31 - you guys probably notice already that is
04:34 - getting kind of cluttered having all
04:36 - this code inside one file so later on
04:40 - I'm going to show you guys how you can
04:41 - actually take each component break it up
04:43 - into a single file and then whenever you
04:46 - run your final build to build your
04:48 - entire program it kind of bundles
04:50 - everything up automatically and makes it
04:52 - run super fast so that's what we'll do
04:54 - in the next couple tutorials it's going
04:55 - to be awesome so I'll see you guys then
