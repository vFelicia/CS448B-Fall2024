00:00 - alright guys welcome to your 30 second
00:02 - and last saw real working with the
00:04 - castle and actually I want to tell you
00:07 - guys something I actually just recorded
00:08 - this story ille and I press produce to
00:11 - actually make the video and it said oh
00:13 - you gotta air Camtasia is messing up so
00:16 - now I have to do the whole dang thing
00:17 - again but for you guys I guess this is
00:19 - your first time watching it so here we
00:21 - go so where we're going to be doing is
00:23 - we have the basic shell of our castle
00:26 - made and now I want to add some lights
00:28 - to it so let's go ahead and up in our
00:31 - content browser oh I already have my
00:33 - light selected right here because I
00:35 - already did the freaking tutorial I'm
00:37 - sorry guys okay calm down calm down
00:40 - Bucky so let's go ahead and drag this
00:41 - out right here and I'm just going to go
00:44 - ahead and position this exactly where
00:46 - you want it and what I'm going to be
00:47 - doing is the very first thing I'm going
00:49 - to be doing is resizing this light and
00:51 - I'm going to resize it to 2.25 because
00:54 - our this store on this and that's the
00:57 - size i need it to be so anyways now just
01:00 - go ahead and grab a slight and first
01:02 - position it vertically like right about
01:05 - there and now what we want to do is in
01:07 - our top view drag it right I want to add
01:11 - three lights along the hallway the first
01:13 - light i'm going to add it kind of near
01:15 - the statues so let's go ahead and rotate
01:17 - this and rotate it 90 degrees so we can
01:20 - stick it right on the wall nicely so
01:23 - right about there it looks good and
01:25 - actually if we go in our front view we
01:28 - can go ahead and move this and push it
01:31 - right back and make sure it's Tucker
01:32 - right on the wall so go ahead and make
01:36 - sure in your perspective view that it
01:39 - looks about the right height and that
01:41 - looks pretty good to me so now if we go
01:44 - ahead in our top view we can go ahead
01:45 - and duplicate this a couple times I'm
01:48 - just going to add three lights like I
01:50 - said so go ahead and alt drag that out
01:54 - and alt drag that one out so now we have
01:58 - three lights along the hallway and
01:59 - actually what I'm going to be doing is
02:01 - going to hit control control so I have
02:05 - all three light selected on that side
02:06 - and if you go ahead and switch over to
02:09 - rotation mode hold down alt and rotate
02:12 - we're going to go ahead and copy all
02:13 - three of those lights so now just go
02:16 - ahead and move this in zoom out make
02:19 - sure you don't deselect them because
02:21 - switch over to move and position those
02:24 - directly across from your other lights
02:26 - so now you can make sure they're
02:28 - directly across because if you go up in
02:31 - your side view right here just make sure
02:33 - there but it up right up against the
02:35 - wall and we can verify that by if we fly
02:37 - around perspective mode we can see that
02:40 - these lights are indeed but it up
02:41 - against the wall nicely so what I'm
02:45 - going to be doing is actually before I
02:47 - even continue if we were to go ahead and
02:50 - play this game right now we won't notice
02:52 - that there's a little light coming from
02:55 - here and there's a little light coming
02:57 - from the statue but that isn't a game
02:59 - light that's just from the emit mode on
03:01 - the materials so actually let me go
03:03 - ahead and pause this video and show you
03:05 - what I'm talking about so I'll be back
03:06 - in one second her all right i went ahead
03:11 - and i built my lights and I was kind of
03:14 - making some noises I know if you guys
03:15 - heard that but let me go ahead and hit
03:17 - play from here and show you guys what I
03:18 - was talking about see those lights right
03:22 - here those aren't game lights those are
03:25 - just the material that's lighting up
03:26 - remember when we talked about material
03:28 - in like less I know 10 towards Orioles
03:30 - are go there's a certain aspect that you
03:33 - can add to the material to make it
03:34 - appear to glow but this isn't really
03:36 - useful whenever you're trying to play
03:38 - the game so whenever we're playing the
03:39 - game we need to add some real legs and
03:42 - in order to do that probably the easiest
03:44 - way is hello didn't know my camera was
03:47 - that fast okay the easiest way is just
03:50 - go ahead and hold l and click on the
03:52 - light and then this adds the actual game
03:54 - light so if we go ahead and switch to a
03:57 - lip mode real quick we can see that
03:59 - there is now a light coming from where
04:02 - that light should be pretty sweet huh
04:04 - and actually you want to pull this out
04:05 - just a little bit to make sure that
04:08 - because you know we don't want it to be
04:10 - in the static mesh or else it might give
04:12 - some weird vibes so go ahead and just
04:14 - pull that out a little bit and now what
04:16 - we can do is switch over to top view and
04:18 - just add one of these lights on top of
04:21 - each of our lights in the game so hold
04:23 - down alt and drag alt and drag and now
04:28 - hold down alt and drag it on the other
04:30 - side let me scroll out to give you guys
04:32 - a better idea of what's going on and all
04:35 - in drag and all in drag so now if you go
04:39 - ahead and hop over to oh we already are
04:42 - in lip mode our hallway is looking
04:45 - pretty good and lit up but if we scroll
04:47 - out here we notice that the front
04:49 - entryway is kind of dark and trick or
04:51 - treaters might get kind of scared to
04:54 - come up through her house and ask for
04:55 - candy during Halloween so we're going to
04:57 - go ahead and light up the outside so go
04:59 - ahead and what I'm going to want to do
05:01 - is just copy oops control-z I'm just
05:05 - going to go ahead and copy one of these
05:07 - lights so go ahead and alt and drag that
05:11 - out and I might as well rotate it 90
05:13 - degrees right now 90 degrees great like
05:17 - that and oh let me see who's texted me
05:19 - you guys don't mind I'm in the middle
05:21 - tutorial right now it's my mom and she
05:24 - says when with a question mark but i
05:27 - forgot what i said before that so I'll
05:31 - worry about that later so anyways if we
05:33 - go ahead and in our move tool drag this
05:36 - above our peak and that looks pretty
05:38 - good right there and now in our front
05:40 - view we can go ahead and push this right
05:43 - to the wall and if we go ahead and
05:45 - switch over to our unlit mode and in
05:47 - perspective view we can verify that this
05:50 - is indeed blooded upright against the
05:52 - wall where we needed to so now I want to
05:54 - add one of these lights to the other
05:55 - side so gret go ahead and grab one of
05:57 - those and hold down alt and drag it to
06:00 - this other side and now hold down L on
06:03 - your keyboard click and add some game
06:05 - Lights right there so add one right
06:07 - there and in our side view right here go
06:10 - ahead and hold down alt and drag one
06:13 - over here so now if you go ahead and
06:15 - scroll out and look
06:16 - in lip mode our game is now looking that
06:20 - looks pretty epic the only thing is this
06:23 - light looks like it's a little bit in
06:25 - our static mesh so go ahead and push
06:29 - that out just a little bit and now we
06:31 - get a more natural light so what I'm
06:34 - going to do is actually going to go
06:35 - ahead and build my lights pause this
06:37 - tutorial and when everything is built
06:39 - I'm going to actually played the game in
06:42 - you know maybe I'll talk a little bit
06:44 - more so hold on one second as soon as I
06:50 - restart this tutorial my mom text me
06:52 - again so let's see Oh interesting my
06:57 - sister's texting me about Twilight and
06:59 - uh well I won't spoil it for you but
07:02 - she's basically keeping me updated on
07:05 - Twilight so any anyways my level is now
07:07 - built so if you go ahead and hit play
07:09 - from here check it out we now get a
07:11 - sweet-looking level and you might not be
07:14 - able to tell in this hallway because i
07:17 - added you know a lot of lights but as
07:19 - you can see outside light is emitting
07:21 - exactly come on cheese let me see what
07:25 - she said yup interesting whoa easy mouse
07:30 - so as you can see a light is emitting
07:32 - exactly where we wanted to be a low
07:35 - light source so that's all I wanted to
07:37 - cover in these tutorials again I know I
07:39 - didn't go over a whole lot concerning
07:41 - static meshes but they're basically
07:43 - isn't a whole lot to go over concerning
07:45 - static meshes once you know how to work
07:48 - with them and place them it's basically
07:49 - practice makes perfect so what I would
07:52 - do is if I was building a real level
07:54 - i'll go ahead and line everything up
07:56 - real nice and neat but for the sake of
07:58 - this story I just wanted to you guys the
08:00 - quick basics of static meshes and you
08:03 - know how to use them and how you can
08:04 - piece them together so what I want you
08:06 - guys to do is build the best level you
08:09 - can and share it with the community show
08:11 - us what your level looks like and you
08:13 - know you can either put it as a video
08:15 - response or take a screenshot and add it
08:18 - to my forum or a website you share it
08:20 - with everyone so I want to see your
08:22 - guys's level hopefully it's a lot better
08:24 - than mine because this one only took
08:25 - like what 10 or 15 minutes
08:27 - but anyways thank you guys for watching
08:29 - don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
08:31 - you guys in the next video
