00:00 - hi this Alex from PHP academy' to org
00:02 - and this is a video for the new Boston
00:04 - now in this we've already looked at or
00:08 - within PHP myadmin we've already looked
00:10 - at creating things deleting things but
00:13 - I'm going to use PHP admin to just
00:15 - demonstrate demonstrate some simple SQL
00:17 - queries just so we understand the basic
00:20 - concept of queries how they work and how
00:22 - they retrieve values and also how to
00:24 - structure them because that's very
00:25 - important
00:26 - the minute we structure it slightly
00:29 - wrong we won't be will be returned an
00:32 - error we'll have an error in our syntax
00:34 - so we've got a tab up here that I've
00:36 - just clicked called SQL now PHP myadmin
00:40 - will also automatically put in this
00:43 - little query from you select star from
00:45 - users where one and that's because we
00:47 - were on the Browse tab here by clicking
00:49 - on this we're doing exactly the same as
00:51 - what we're doing on the Browse tab it
00:53 - will return everything from at this
00:55 - table there's no limits to this at all
00:58 - it's just select everything meaning star
01:01 - from the table users and where one is
01:05 - irrelevant we can take this out so now
01:09 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
01:09 - click go and you can see that this has
01:13 - showing rows 0 to 1 and to total query
01:17 - Turk and in amount of seconds and it's
01:20 - shown our query here with this limit on
01:24 - the end which I'll explain soon but
01:26 - we've been we've retrieved exactly the
01:28 - same data as if we were to click browse
01:30 - so this SQL this SQL query for us at the
01:39 - moment is that useless inside PHP
01:41 - myadmin but when we're working within
01:43 - PHP we might want to select everything
01:45 - from the database however some advice
01:48 - for you is to not use select star
01:50 - because what you're doing is when you're
01:53 - selecting data from a database you
01:54 - rarely will need all of it I could just
01:58 - say select username password for example
02:01 - if I was logging my user in I'm not
02:03 - going to need to access their username
02:05 - or password at their first name or last
02:08 - name to log them in because this is a
02:10 - relevant login details we just need the
02:12 - username and password
02:13 - so if we would just say select username
02:16 - and then comma password now bear in mind
02:20 - these have to exactly match your field
02:22 - names and as with this here you can
02:25 - enclose them in either semicolons or
02:31 - this slanted ab not a semicolon sorry a
02:34 - single quotation mark or this slanted '
02:40 - so we're using an apostrophe here in our
02:45 - username and password so now let's click
02:47 - go and see what happens so what we've
02:50 - done is we've returned a query but this
02:52 - time we've only selected a certain
02:55 - amount of data we want to be retrieved
02:56 - so we've automatically cut time out of
03:01 - our query you can see here it says seven
03:03 - seconds however if we were to select
03:07 - everything no it's quicker but yeah okay
03:11 - so my point there was rendered invalid
03:14 - but when we're working within PHP and
03:16 - we're using lots of queries at once or
03:18 - we're using joins things like that which
03:20 - you'll learn later we want to be
03:22 - selecting as quick as possible
03:24 - plus there's no need to select some
03:27 - amounts of data so here I'm saying
03:28 - select username password from users now
03:34 - at the moment we've got this where one
03:36 - where one's just going to select
03:37 - everything so where one one's true so
03:40 - it's going to select everything but what
03:43 - we can do is we can specify where we
03:45 - want to select this data in specifics
03:47 - now remember we've got unique user name
03:50 - fields a user unique ID field sorry and
03:54 - here we've got ID of one and two for
03:57 - Alex and Billy and these are unique to
03:58 - this user so let's say I just wanted to
04:02 - return from ID one all I need to do is
04:06 - say where ID equals one and we can put
04:11 - that in there as well so we're ID equals
04:14 - one so this is going to select the
04:16 - username and password from the users
04:18 - table which way in where the ID is equal
04:21 - to one and we're not using a double
04:23 - equals here we're just using equals
04:25 - because there's no assignment of data
04:27 - using this equal sign so in PHP we use a
04:30 - double equals button structured query
04:32 - language we use at an equal sign so
04:35 - let's click go and see what happens
04:36 - I know column 1 right okay okay so let's
04:41 - go back to edit this ID okay right okay
04:48 - no problem so let's go back to SQL and
04:50 - we'll start again so we want to select
04:53 - I'll tell you why that error occurred in
04:55 - there username password from users where
05:04 - ID equals 1 without our that our
05:10 - [Music]
05:12 - apostrophes so now we can click go and
05:16 - our query was successful this time so
05:19 - you can see what we've done is we've
05:20 - only selected Alex and password so we've
05:23 - selected the username and password where
05:26 - the ID is equal to 1 if we look back
05:28 - here you can see that the idea one
05:29 - matches Alex Alex is data so it's quite
05:32 - simple to grab the data that you need ok
05:36 - so let's return to SQL this time what I
05:38 - want to do is I want to perform a query
05:42 - which is going to retrieve the username
05:47 - and part or the first name and the
05:49 - surname but with this time we're going
05:51 - to specify a username and a password
05:53 - now if the username and password don't
05:55 - match we're not going to return this
05:58 - data however if the part username and
06:00 - password do match we're going to return
06:02 - this data so this is essentially a login
06:04 - system and to do this we're going to say
06:06 - select a first-name lastname remember
06:11 - this is the data we want to display when
06:13 - we've selected it and we don't need to
06:16 - put these in in apostrophes but it's
06:19 - probably good practice to so first-name
06:22 - lastname from users
06:27 - we're and this is where we specify the
06:29 - username and the password now if I was
06:32 - to say where username equals or is equal
06:37 - to Alex and so we're using an OP M a n
06:43 - operator here with sang and password or
06:48 - not in capitals equals Fred for example
06:53 - or possibly equals a P 1 2 3 or P so
06:59 - what we're doing here is we're selecting
07:00 - the first name and last name like I said
07:02 - we're going to be returning this data
07:05 - from the users table where user name is
07:08 - Alex and password equals P now nowhere
07:10 - in this table does the user name equals
07:12 - Alex and the password equal P we've got
07:15 - user name equals Alex and password
07:17 - equals password and user name Billy and
07:19 - party password equals past 1 2 3
07:21 - so what we're actually doing this query
07:23 - here is we're returning no rows and
07:27 - you'll see that when I click go in a
07:29 - moment now this is automatically told us
07:33 - that a username and a password
07:35 - combination is invalid therefore a login
07:37 - cannot be processed so let's click go
07:40 - okay so we've got unknown column last
07:42 - name okay surname so this corrected
07:49 - query should now return o username
07:53 - equals Alex password equals P
08:07 - okay let's try at that in the click go
08:14 - okay so my MySQL so I've used I've used
08:20 - apostrophes for this and just single
08:23 - quotation marks for the actual data
08:24 - itself so MySQL returned an empty result
08:27 - set I easy ro-ro's so this query here
08:31 - that we've selected Alex is for the used
08:34 - lemon puppy for the password has
08:37 - returned no data there for the username
08:39 - may exist but the password might be
08:41 - wrong so in general we have a username
08:46 - and password combination error so now
08:48 - what happens if we run the query with
08:50 - the correct data in so you can see that
08:52 - my username is Alex here my password is
08:55 - password so let's run this and see what
08:57 - happens
