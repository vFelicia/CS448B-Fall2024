00:00 - what's up guys it's Bucky and welcome
00:01 - back to another Back aming tutorial in
00:04 - this tutorial what I'm going to be doing
00:05 - is beginning to talk about strategy and
00:08 - give you guys some tips that are going
00:09 - to give you the competitive advantage
00:11 - over your opponent so check this out the
00:14 - first thing that I want to talk about is
00:16 - making a new point so a new Point again
00:19 - is taking two or more Checkers and
00:22 - putting it on empty point now a new
00:25 - point is good for a couple of reasons
00:27 - first of all when you're traveling
00:29 - around the board with your Checkers it
00:31 - gives you a safe space to land because
00:33 - remember one Checker alone is vulnerable
00:36 - to be hit so you often want to make new
00:38 - points for that reason also as you can
00:41 - see one of your opponent's Checkers
00:44 - can't land on point that's occupied by
00:47 - two or more of your Checkers so that's
00:50 - why another reason that making a new
00:52 - point is good because it gives your
00:54 - opponent more problems and it makes it
00:56 - more difficult for them to move around
00:57 - the board so there you go
01:00 - so let's go ahead and take a look at
01:02 - some common opening plays and let me
01:05 - just tell you guys this here's a little
01:06 - quick rule you can
01:08 - remember as soon as you start out on
01:11 - your opening play anytime you roll the
01:14 - dice and the numbers on it are separated
01:17 - by two spaces for example one and three
01:21 - that's separated by two spaces um two
01:23 - and four 3 and five or 4 and six anytime
01:27 - your dice are separated by two number
01:29 - numbers you can go ahead and make a new
01:32 - point in your home board and this is
01:34 - going to be a great advantage to start
01:36 - out so let's go ahead and take a look at
01:38 - those points right now say you roll this
01:39 - one and your three to start here's what
01:41 - you typically want to do you want to
01:43 - move this sixo to a five to get a
01:46 - checker on your fivepoint and move this
01:48 - one on your eight point one 2 3 so move
01:52 - this one one move this one three and
01:54 - check it out you know you now got your
01:57 - new five point and what's the benefit of
01:59 - this first of all when you're traveling
02:01 - around you now have a safe spot to
02:05 - land and also it makes these two
02:08 - Checkers harder to escape from their or
02:10 - excuse me go past your home board so now
02:13 - that they could land on 1 2 3 or four
02:16 - they now have four and five blocked off
02:19 - as well as seven right there so it's
02:21 - going to make it uh a lot more difficult
02:23 - for them to move around to get those
02:25 - last Checkers out so another thing two
02:28 - and four
02:31 - your
02:32 - two and your four is going to give you
02:35 - your new four point your three and your
02:38 - five is going to give you your new
02:40 - threep point and whenever you roll a
02:42 - four and a six that's going to give you
02:44 - your new two point that isn't really
02:46 - useful because it's uh I mean if you
02:49 - roll it you roll it but it's going to be
02:51 - real easy for your opponent to roll
02:52 - anything to hop right over you but
02:54 - anyways still a good play nonetheless so
02:57 - that is your basics of why making a new
03:00 - point is good and remember your little
03:02 - tip when starting out anytime you have a
03:04 - roll separated by two numbers you can
03:07 - always make a new point in your home
03:09 - board so don't forget it all right guys
03:11 - the next scenario I want to point out is
03:14 - whenever you have the option of making a
03:16 - point in your home board versus making a
03:18 - point in your outer board now let's say
03:20 - you've been playing for a little bit and
03:21 - the board looks like this remember
03:23 - you're brown right now so you just
03:25 - rolled a 61 and remember from my last
03:28 - tutorial I told you it's always always a
03:30 - good idea to make a new point so you're
03:32 - looking at the board looking to make a
03:33 - new point and you see that you have two
03:35 - options you can go ahead and play your
03:36 - 61 like this 1 2 3 4 5 6 and move this
03:41 - one to one which will give you a new
03:43 - point in your home
03:44 - board or what you can do is make your
03:47 - new seven point by playing this 1 2 3 4
03:50 - 5 6 and moving your eight to seven for
03:53 - your one now this will give you a new
03:55 - point on your seven right here so you're
03:58 - saying all right should I have a new
03:59 - point on my five or a new point on my
04:02 - seven which one is more beneficial and
04:04 - why well typically when you have the
04:07 - option of making a new point on your
04:08 - home board versus new making a new point
04:11 - on your outer board you typically want
04:13 - to make a new point on your home board
04:15 - now this uh exists for a couple reasons
04:18 - first reason is this these Checkers on
04:21 - your sixo are kind of hard to play
04:23 - because if you look at these Checkers
04:25 - back here here are all the options you
04:28 - can move it to all of these these points
04:30 - but these Checkers on your six point
04:32 - right here you only have four options
04:33 - right now so whenever you have the
04:35 - opportunity to make a good play with
04:37 - these Checkers you typically want to do
04:39 - so another thing is if you go ahead and
04:41 - play your
04:42 - 61 right now you see that not only does
04:46 - it make it harder for these chips to
04:48 - escape but whenever you capture any
04:50 - Checkers that are coming off the bar
04:52 - remember they got to roll off and they
04:54 - got to land on one of these spots right
04:56 - here so whenever you can block more
04:58 - spots for them it's going to make it
05:00 - harder for them to come off the bar and
05:02 - remember if they're not able to come off
05:03 - the bar in the roll then they have to
05:06 - pass their turn so if you fall from
05:08 - behind but you got a good block setup
05:10 - right here then this leads to potential
05:12 - for a huge comeback or if you're in the
05:15 - lead then you can pull away and secure
05:18 - your win so anyways anytime you can make
05:20 - a point in your home board you typically
05:23 - want to do so and this is a perfect
05:25 - example of that
