00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:02 - with the video tutorial for the new
00:04 - Boston in this video we are going to be
00:07 - creating a table and we're going to be
00:09 - using the even and at the even and odd
00:13 - selectors to actually change a class of
00:17 - a particular table row so I have an
00:23 - index page here and what I've done is
00:25 - I've included table J s as part of my
00:28 - JavaScript include files and I've also
00:31 - got style dot CSS which is quite
00:33 - important because we're going to be
00:34 - creating a class that's going to change
00:37 - the tables the rows of the table evenly
00:40 - or oddly now I have an example just here
00:43 - you can see that we've got the first one
00:46 - with the background slightly you know a
00:48 - darker or lighter gray then we have
00:52 - white and then we have this gray again
00:53 - and then white and if this table was
00:55 - longer it would continue to select the
00:57 - first second fourth etc etc rows in the
01:02 - table so this is all done using jQuery
01:05 - so let's just go ahead and open up my
01:10 - text editor again I'm going to go ahead
01:12 - and create this table first of all so we
01:15 - create a table here we're going to give
01:16 - this a class name in just a moment but
01:19 - not for now I'm just going to create
01:20 - some rows and then inside that some
01:22 - table data and for the first one I'm
01:25 - just going to say it first row so first
01:27 - row we can go ahead and copy and paste
01:29 - this down to make four rows and just go
01:33 - ahead and modify these accordingly so
01:35 - just while I'm typing these out this
01:37 - could be for example data that's
01:39 - retrieved from a database table that you
01:42 - might have put into a table for example
01:44 - for each row of data you might be
01:46 - displaying a table row and then the data
01:50 - inside of this so you might want to find
01:52 - an easy way to append a class to this
01:54 - table in order to get the effect that
01:56 - we've just looked at in my browser so
01:58 - let's go ahead and continue filling this
02:00 - in and we'll say which we say last or
02:04 - fourth or so forth okay so we've got
02:06 - these rows in the table let's just go
02:09 - ahead and see what that looks like you
02:10 - can see there's no borders at the moment
02:12 - but we can fix that in style
02:13 - ss in just a moment I'm going to go
02:15 - ahead and give this table a class for
02:18 - now I'm just going to call it table but
02:20 - if you do want to create say tables that
02:22 - display this effect you might want to go
02:25 - ahead get ahead and give it a more
02:26 - distinctive name but for now we're going
02:28 - to keep it as table
02:29 - so inside star dot CSS let's go ahead
02:32 - and change the styling of this and we're
02:35 - just going to go ahead and create some
02:37 - borders on this so we'll say border one
02:41 - pixel solid and black here we're also
02:45 - going to need to say table TR and also
02:49 - table TD and now just ensure that we get
02:52 - borders around everything so now that
02:55 - we've done this we want to go ahead and
02:56 - use jQuery to highlight these even rows
02:59 - or the odd rows depending so we can
03:03 - actually use jQuery to select the even
03:06 - rows on this table or the odd rows on
03:08 - this table and then highlight them
03:10 - accordingly and what we're going to need
03:11 - to do is create a class that we're going
03:13 - to add to each row and that class I'm
03:16 - just going to call highlights so I'm
03:18 - going to do in here is set the
03:20 - background color of this class to F 0 F
03:23 - 0 F 0 which was the color that you saw
03:26 - in the first part of the tutorial now
03:28 - that we've done this we've completely
03:29 - set up our page we've added this
03:31 - highlight class as well as modified this
03:34 - class that we referenced with the table
03:36 - and now we can go ahead and write our
03:38 - jQuery code so we're going to ensure
03:40 - that the document is loaded and the Dom
03:42 - is ready so we're going to say document
03:45 - document ready and then inside here is a
03:48 - function inside these curly brackets
03:51 - here is where our code is going to be so
03:52 - we'll just pull them down slightly ok so
03:55 - now what we want to do is add a class to
03:57 - this table now if for example we wanted
03:59 - to go ahead and add a class to the
04:01 - entire table we would use a selector and
04:05 - we would say dot table remember it's a
04:06 - class selector and then we would say dot
04:09 - CSS and sorry know we could use CSS to
04:12 - manually do it but we want to add this
04:14 - existing class that we've created this
04:17 - highlight class in our style dot CSS
04:19 - file so inside here we just go ahead and
04:22 - specify the class that we want to apply
04:24 - to this particular element and in this
04:26 - case it will just
04:27 - I like the entire table however this is
04:30 - obviously isn't the effect that we're
04:31 - looking for the first thing we want to
04:33 - do is highlight only the rows you can
04:35 - see at the moment we've highlighted the
04:36 - entire table we only want to highlight
04:39 - the Rose so we specify table TR and this
04:43 - will just highlight each table row you
04:44 - can see that the gray has disappeared
04:46 - from the outside borders now what we
04:49 - want to go ahead and do is select only
04:51 - even elements in this set so essentially
04:55 - what we're doing is we're matching this
04:56 - TR set and we use a colon to do this and
05:01 - then we type in either even or odd and
05:04 - this will select the either even or odd
05:07 - table TRS so each one of these elements
05:10 - will select either even or odd and then
05:13 - apply that particular class here using
05:15 - add class to these so now that we've
05:18 - done that we can go ahead and refresh
05:19 - and you can see that the effect that we
05:21 - get is we've highlighted the first row
05:23 - left the second row highlighted the
05:25 - third row and left the fourth row and if
05:28 - we were to go ahead and say modify this
05:30 - and just add some more table rows let's
05:33 - just go down and add some more in you
05:36 - can see that we get exactly the same
05:38 - effect we've highlighted the first third
05:41 - fight fifth sorry yeah and so and so on
05:45 - and so forth so an unlimited amount of
05:47 - data we're going to use the even to
05:49 - select each one and again we can change
05:51 - this to odd as well and that will just
05:53 - change how we do that so these are the
05:57 - even and the odd selectors in jQuery and
05:59 - they don't just need to be applied to
06:01 - tables they can be applied to say a set
06:04 - of paragraphs it entirely depends for
06:08 - example we could change this to a div
06:11 - for example we could say div and then
06:15 - all odd paragraphs we apply the
06:18 - highlight to so we're going ahead and
06:20 - just quickly demonstrate this now let's
06:23 - go ahead and create a div here
06:27 - let's just pull that down and let's just
06:30 - type what's the name that we gave this
06:32 - we will just call it an area for example
06:36 - so we'll give this an ID of area now
06:39 - inside here we could have a few
06:41 - paragraphs and all of them could contain
06:45 - just from some text for example so text
06:48 - 1 text - text 3 and text 4 so now we
06:56 - have something looking like this so now
06:59 - what we can do is in table J s we can
07:01 - select all the paragraphs all the odd
07:03 - paragraphs inside area and add this
07:05 - highlight class to them so now when we
07:07 - refresh you can see that we get exactly
07:09 - the same effect where we've added this
07:11 - background color to each paragraph so
07:14 - it's versatile in the sense that you can
07:16 - use it with almost all elements even
07:19 - sort of input fields you could you know
07:22 - highlight every one however the main you
07:25 - know useful demonstration for this is
07:28 - using tables as we did initially so
07:31 - that's the even and odd selectors in
07:33 - jQuery
