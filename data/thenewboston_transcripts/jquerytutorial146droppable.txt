00:01 - it's just yes I mean I guess it doesn't
00:04 - really matter about placing just yeah
00:07 - but let's just go to this example let's
00:10 - just say you only wanted names in this
00:11 - first div but you wanted places in this
00:13 - second div the accept options basically
00:17 - allows you to only allow specific groups
00:20 - of objects so by class to be dropped
00:23 - into particular elements so we're going
00:25 - to be using the example that only these
00:27 - two names are going to be allowed to
00:28 - drop be dropped into here but London the
00:31 - place is not going to be allowed to drop
00:33 - into here so let's go ahead and change
00:37 - around our code inside here I'm
00:40 - essentially just going to allow both to
00:44 - be draggable so both of our class names
00:47 - so name and place to be draggable so we
00:50 - say name comma and then place so now
00:54 - that we have name and place draggable
00:56 - these are both draggable and london is
01:00 - also draggable as well that's the place
01:01 - so we've got name and place that are
01:03 - both draggable containment is within the
01:06 - document and they both revert back to
01:08 - their original position so now that
01:10 - we've done this we've made our drop area
01:13 - which is a div droppable however now we
01:15 - can specify which class we want to
01:19 - accept so I'm going to choose to only
01:21 - accept class name so now that that's
01:24 - happened we can go ahead and test this
01:32 - out now when I drop dragged London over
01:34 - here you'll see that nothing happens
01:36 - however when I go ahead and drag oh no
01:39 - that's not worked
01:40 - it is dots name when a drag London over
01:44 - nothing happens when I drag Billy over
01:46 - which is a name we get this border so
01:49 - that's allowed the drag will allowed the
01:51 - drop so London doesn't change the
01:54 - outside because remember we specified
01:56 - the hover class here because this only
01:59 - accepts name none of these will be valid
02:02 - well this one at least won't be valid
02:04 - the tolerance will still be valid but
02:07 - hover class will only add this class in
02:10 - when it's accept
02:13 - a specific class so now that we've got
02:15 - that you can start to see the use of it
02:17 - for example if you didn't want places a
02:20 - list of places to be dragged into here
02:22 - they're not allowed to be dragged but
02:24 - names are allowed to be dragged okay so
02:28 - now let's take a look at some of the
02:29 - events that we can apply to this to
02:31 - actually make more use out of it now
02:34 - we're not actually going to be creating
02:35 - a list type drop box essentially what
02:38 - you could do this is when you dragged
02:39 - Alex over and released you could add
02:41 - that name to this box and the same with
02:43 - Billy you could then add that under Alex
02:45 - again London wouldn't allow you to drop
02:48 - it so that would be the point of the
02:50 - application however you'll find this
02:52 - tutorial in the example tutorials in
02:55 - this series so you'll be able to
02:56 - actually create a draggable and
02:58 - droppable list application but for now
03:01 - we're going to be looking at events so
03:02 - at least we know how to handle specific
03:04 - events so I'm going to create a comma
03:07 - after here and come down a few lines and
03:09 - I'm going to create an over event and
03:12 - this is going to be a function and then
03:15 - going to comma and I'm going to come
03:18 - down and create an out event and that's
03:21 - function again and again just keep comma
03:24 - separating and the last event we're
03:26 - going to take a look at is drop and
03:28 - again that is a function so pull that
03:30 - down there pull this up just to tidy R
03:34 - and we can indent these so hopefully
03:37 - that doesn't look too messy and it makes
03:39 - sense to you the over functions
03:41 - basically what's going to happen when
03:43 - something hovers over the out function
03:47 - is going to is what's going to happen
03:48 - when we've hovered something over and
03:50 - then we take it out again and the drop
03:53 - function is going to be when we actually
03:55 - release something inside of this box so
03:58 - we're going to change some text inside
03:59 - of this box depending on whether we've
04:01 - hovered over taking an element back out
04:04 - of the box or when we've dropped an
04:06 - element inside of the box so over all we
04:09 - won't really want to do is add some text
04:12 - to our drop
04:14 - how drop div so I'm going to add the
04:17 - text something has hovered over me so
04:26 - now when we hover something over we get
04:28 - this text inside something as hovered
04:30 - over me when we take it out nothing
04:33 - happens it just remains as this text
04:35 - here let's just go ahead and give this
04:38 - some padding so it looks a bit better so
04:42 - when we hover that over something has
04:44 - hovered over me that's fair enough
04:45 - now what we want to do is go ahead and
04:47 - specify what happens when we drag a
04:49 - particular element out so we again use
04:52 - the selector to select drop and we apply
04:55 - the text something has been dragged out
05:03 - and when we refresh we can drag
05:07 - something in when we drag it out it
05:10 - changes to something has been dragged
05:12 - out so now the last thing is the actual
05:17 - drop of it so we again use this selector
05:19 - to select the drop div and inside the
05:21 - text something has dropped now we'll
05:26 - just put something dropped now do
05:30 - okay so let's hover over something has
05:33 - hovered over me we can hover back out
05:34 - drag back in so these work sort of in
05:37 - sequence with other one we wouldn't let
05:39 - go it says something dropped same with
05:41 - Billy and London doesn't do it because
05:43 - it hasn't got the acceptance to be
05:46 - dropped in so we can't actually hover
05:48 - this over and let go so these two
05:51 - elements work because we've applied the
05:53 - accept option and we've created these
05:56 - three events that handle the dragging of
06:01 - the hovering of something over something
06:02 - being dragged out or or something that
06:06 - is hovering being taken out of this
06:07 - particular div and then we've applied an
06:11 - event to see when something has actually
06:13 - dropped inside so now that you have the
06:16 - fundamentals of dropping you droppable
06:19 - you can go ahead and look at the
06:22 - the jQuery UI documentation and actually
06:26 - take a look at some of the other options
06:27 - however these should be enough to allow
06:30 - you to drop things into them form lists
06:34 - based on things that have dropped etc
06:36 - etc so that's the droppable interaction
06:42 - in jQuery UI
