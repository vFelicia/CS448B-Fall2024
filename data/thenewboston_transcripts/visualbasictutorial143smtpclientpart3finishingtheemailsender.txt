00:00 - create message subs let's create one
00:02 - more that will send the message
00:04 - so private sub send message and then
00:09 - we'll just do SMTP or SMTP sender dot
00:15 - Sindh and we're gonna send my message
00:21 - now what we're gonna have to do is
00:23 - enclose this in a try-catch statement so
00:26 - in case something goes wrong our whole
00:28 - program won't crash
00:29 - so catch e^x as exception and then we'll
00:35 - just in try so if something happens and
00:40 - we get an exception let's just go ahead
00:42 - and show that
00:43 - so message box dot show e^x dot two
00:49 - string and we gotta close this with one
00:54 - more okay so now let's double click on
00:59 - button sin and what we're gonna need to
01:02 - do is call each one of these so we'll
01:04 - start off by creating the message we
01:09 - will create the SMTP and then we will
01:15 - send the message
01:21 - and now for discard all we have to do is
01:24 - just clear each one of the text boxes so
01:27 - text body dot clear text from dot clear
01:33 - text pass dot clear I had the subject we
01:41 - got to clear the subject and then that
01:42 - body or weight - okay so let's go ahead
01:52 - and run this and hopefully we won't get
01:54 - any errors and it will send our email so
01:59 - we're gonna do from and it will just do
02:02 - my email address so this is going to be
02:05 - censored out and one more thing before
02:11 - we actually send it let's go ahead we'll
02:14 - go over to our text pass properties and
02:18 - we need to not show the text so password
02:23 - character is going to be a star or an
02:27 - asterisk so let's go ahead and run this
02:29 - again so we'll do from type in my email
02:35 - address password you can see that the
02:41 - password is all stars right there now
02:43 - I'll just send it to myself I will do
02:50 - visual basic email and then we'll just
02:55 - say turtles let's go ahead and click
03:00 - send
03:09 - and you can see because I enabled SSL
03:11 - encryption my avast detected it so let's
03:14 - just go ahead and we'll close out of
03:17 - this and we'll go back and disable SSL
03:21 - so we'll just set that equal to false
03:25 - let's go ahead and run it again
03:28 - so from
03:43 - okay so we'll go ahead and send it
03:51 - hopefully everything works now we'll
03:53 - open up my email and we'll just click
03:55 - send or receive if it's on here now here
04:00 - let me drag this away real quick and you
04:09 - can see here here's the message that
04:12 - says turtles and it's - Sam McNally from
04:17 - Sam mcanally and then we've got turtles
04:20 - which is the one we said before that was
04:21 - blocked by avast and I guess it got
04:23 - through so go ahead make this email
04:28 - sender if you haven't already you can
04:30 - learn a lot from it you can change stuff
04:31 - inside of it and then once you've done
04:33 - that go ahead and move on to the next
