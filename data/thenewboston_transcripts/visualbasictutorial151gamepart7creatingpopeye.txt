00:01 - so we'll start off by creating a random
00:04 - generator so dim Jin as new random now
00:15 - we will just declare attack number as
00:20 - integer and we'll set it equal to Gen
00:24 - dot next and we'll have a max value of 4
00:31 - so it will give us possible values or
00:34 - not let's do a max value of 3 so it will
00:36 - give us the possible values of 0 1 & 2
00:40 - so let's go ahead and do a select case
00:45 - so select case attack num and we'll just
00:52 - do case 0 so if he punches what do we
00:56 - want to do well we want to do enemy
00:59 - health minus equals and let's say let's
01:05 - do 5 so now let's come up here and we'll
01:11 - create a variable so public and we'll
01:15 - just call it as spinach as boo lien and
01:19 - we'll go ahead and set it equal to false
01:20 - to begin with so we'll go ahead and
01:30 - we'll use an if statement so if has
01:35 - spinach then what do we want to do well
01:40 - we want to double the damage so if he
01:44 - asks us spinach then we'll go ahead and
01:45 - the new - equals 5 times 2 so it will
01:51 - subtract 10 so let's go ahead and cut
01:55 - this right here and if we use if has
01:58 - spinach that will run if it's true
02:00 - because of your testing and see if
02:01 - something's true you don't have to put
02:03 - equals true so then if it equals false
02:06 - then we'll just go ahead and take away 5
02:08 - now we'll do this for each of the
02:10 - possible values so
02:13 - case one if has spinach then enemy
02:21 - health minus equals and we will do for a
02:25 - kick let's do 8 times 2 or what we'll do
02:31 - 10 times 2 and then if he doesn't then
02:36 - enemy health minus equals 10 and then
02:42 - for the last attack case 2 the anchor
02:48 - throw if has spinach then enemy health
02:55 - minus equals 15 times 2 and then if he
03:02 - doesn't then enemy health minus equals
03:06 - 15 now in order for us to be able to get
03:12 - that enemy health and set it we're gonna
03:14 - have to come over to our enemy class
03:16 - which all of our other enemies inherit
03:18 - from and we're going to have to make
03:19 - health a read and write property so
03:25 - under our get and in get we will do type
03:29 - set and it will fill a bivalve value as
03:31 - integer and what we want to do is type
03:35 - int health equals value so now that now
03:42 - they can set the health of the enemy and
03:46 - we can use that inside of this attack so
03:50 - let's go ahead we'll come over here to
03:52 - our form on BB design and let's just
03:55 - shrink the attack button down a little
03:57 - bit so we'll make it say that big and
04:03 - let's come over here
04:04 - come over here to our toolbox and we
04:06 - will add a radio button so we will line
04:13 - it up here with our button and we will
04:16 - set the text to use spinach
04:22 - but first we'll set the name - radio
04:26 - spinach and we'll set the text to use
04:37 - spinach and now let's go ahead and add a
04:42 - label and we'll just let's move
04:48 - everything down a little bit here so
04:55 - we'll set the name to label spinach left
05:01 - and we will set the text to spinach left
05:07 - and then three so the user will be able
05:13 - to use the spinach a total of three
05:16 - times now they won't know what attack
05:18 - this is going to use it on because it's
05:20 - generated randomly so let's go ahead and
05:25 - resize everything so now what we need to
05:31 - do is come into form 1vb and let's
05:34 - create an object of popeye so private
05:39 - let's just call him hero as new Popeye
05:45 - so now that we've created that let's go
05:48 - ahead and use him when he attacks so
05:51 - we'll come over here to form on Beebe we
05:53 - will double click on attack and what we
05:57 - want to do is check to see if they have
05:59 - selected it use spinach so we will come
06:04 - up here and we will create a variable so
06:08 - private int spinach as integer and we'll
06:15 - set it equal to three so
06:20 - if radio spinach dot checked equals true
06:29 - then we'll go ahead and set the has
06:35 - spinach equal to true so hero dot has
06:42 - spinach equals true so now that now that
06:46 - it is true we will just go ahead and
06:48 - attack so hero dot attack and what we
06:55 - want to do is access the health of the
06:58 - enemy so we'll type current enemy dot
07:01 - health so after your attacks what we
07:08 - want to do is set has spinach back to
07:11 - false so hero dot has spinach equals
07:14 - false now we also want to see how many
07:17 - of these they have left so if this is
07:20 - checked if this check two goes through
07:22 - and if in spinach is greater than zero
07:28 - so in spinach is greater than zero then
07:34 - we will set that equal to true and then
07:37 - in spinach minus equals one so we just
07:40 - take one away from it and so when we
07:44 - attack the enemy what we want to do is
07:47 - is update the the health bar so with our
07:54 - progress bar enemy dot value equals
07:59 - current enemy dot health so let's go
08:05 - ahead and run this and see what happens
08:18 - okay so you can see that I've spawned
08:20 - the enemy and it has full house health
08:22 - and what we need to do is set the full
08:25 - health bar when the forum unloads but
08:27 - for now we'll just ignore that so if we
08:29 - check you spinach and click attack you
08:31 - can see that it takes some health off
08:32 - the enemy and we can attack again and
08:35 - again until the enemy is dead
08:39 - and then what we can do is check to see
08:41 - if the enemy has no values left in the
08:45 - progress bar and then we will show a
08:48 - message box saying that do you have one
08:51 - so we'll go ahead and stop this and so
08:55 - go ahead and put this code in if you
08:57 - already haven't if you haven't already I
08:59 - mean and once you do that go ahead and
09:01 - move on on to the next tutorial where we
09:04 - will be working more on this game
