00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash the on live gamer for the new
00:04 - boston and in this tutorial we're going
00:06 - to be talking about eye disposable now
00:09 - what i disposable let you do is get rid
00:12 - of objects after you've used them so
00:15 - that you can make better use of the
00:17 - memory that you're using and you won't
00:19 - have to have garbage collection do all
00:21 - of the work for you
00:22 - so what we're going to do is create a
00:25 - new project here so we'll go to file new
00:28 - project will shrink it down and we'll
00:32 - call will select windows forms
00:35 - application and we will call it eye
00:38 - disposable test and then go ahead and
00:42 - click okay so now what we need to do is
00:46 - we need to add a class to our eye
00:48 - disposable test
00:49 - so we'll we will add a class and we will
00:56 - call this class do stuff so we have a
01:00 - class that will do stuff dot VB and
01:03 - we'll go ahead and click add so here's
01:06 - our class that we've created and so now
01:09 - we need to do is to be able to dispose
01:10 - of objects created on this class we're
01:13 - going to have to use the implements keep
01:15 - keyword to use eye disposable so the way
01:19 - to do this is by typing implements eye
01:24 - disposable and we go ahead and click tab
01:27 - and click enter you can see that adds a
01:30 - whole bunch of this code for us
01:31 - so it says region eye disposable support
01:36 - so it just creates a region in our class
01:38 - that holds all of these subs for us and
01:42 - we have a disposed value as believe
01:46 - which we'll see if the current object
01:50 - has been disposed we've got a disposed
01:52 - sub and a dispose a second one of it so
01:58 - you can read the comments on this if you
02:00 - want to see what it does but we don't
02:02 - really have to worry about that right
02:03 - now we can just leave that the way it is
02:05 - and I highly suggest that you do not
02:07 - change that so we will add some subs
02:10 - here so what type of public sub
02:14 - so message and then we'll just type
02:20 - message box this is a message okay so
02:28 - now that we've created a sub that will
02:31 - show a message we can go ahead and come
02:34 - into our forum 1vb designer and we will
02:38 - add a button to this so we'll just set
02:42 - the text to show message and we will set
02:47 - the name to button message and we'll
02:52 - just make this a little bit bigger so
02:54 - that it will fit all these words we'll
02:57 - double click on the show message event
03:00 - handler and we'll just zoom in here okay
03:05 - so now we need to do is we need to
03:08 - create an object of the do stuff class
03:11 - so we'll go ahead and type dim new do
03:17 - stuff as new do stuff so this creates an
03:26 - object of our do stuff class and now
03:29 - what we need to do is we need to call
03:30 - show message so we will type the name of
03:33 - our object and we will just use the show
03:38 - message sub okay so now it's just show
03:41 - the message and now once that's done
03:43 - showing the message what we want to do
03:45 - is we want to get rid of ours to us new
03:48 - do stuff object so that the memory we
03:52 - have more free memory so we'll just go
03:55 - ahead and type new do stuff and then
04:00 - we're going to use dot right there and
04:02 - we will just call dispose so dot dispose
04:08 - and you see that it has been created by
04:13 - eye disposable for us okay so now we
04:17 - need to do is we need to come back into
04:18 - new form and do a formal VB and we need
04:22 - to set new do stuff equal to
04:25 - nothing which will completely get rid of
04:28 - our object so let's go ahead and run
04:31 - this and you can see that if we click
04:34 - show message right here it says this is
04:37 - a message and the title is the by
04:40 - default when you call message box the
04:42 - title is going to be the name of your
04:44 - project let's go ahead and click OK
04:46 - and when it does that you can see that
04:48 - it gets rid of our new do stuff object
04:53 - so go ahead and create a couple classes
04:57 - that implement eye disposable so that
05:00 - you can dispose the value I'm not
05:03 - supposed to value dispose the object
05:05 - once you're done using it and then after
05:07 - you've done that go ahead and move on to
05:09 - some of the next tutorials we're going
05:10 - to be talking a little bit more about
05:12 - eye disposable and using objects and
05:15 - making it more memory efficient so
05:17 - thanks for watching and stay tuned for
05:19 - the next tutorial
