00:00 - so let's just refresh you'll see that
00:02 - now it will go up in I'll actually know
00:04 - I have to go ahead and set this to zero
00:06 - and step this at five so now you can see
00:10 - that it will go up in increments of five
00:12 - pounds so starting from nothing and
00:14 - going all the way up to 400 in
00:16 - increments of five pounds so every time
00:19 - we can only have multiples of five so
00:22 - that would be useful if you were to say
00:24 - step predefined amounts that you wanted
00:26 - to be used only so for example you know
00:30 - how much money do you want to donate you
00:32 - could maybe reduce this to one hundred
00:35 - and step at ten so the user has the
00:38 - option of say donating ten twenty thirty
00:40 - all the way up to one hundred so it
00:42 - makes it a lot clearer to actually for
00:44 - the user to to define obviously you
00:47 - wouldn't when you wouldn't use step if
00:49 - you wanted to allow any value between
00:53 - two particular values which at the
00:55 - moment is one and four hundred so now
00:58 - we're going to take a look at changing
01:00 - the slider to a particular range so at
01:04 - the moment we can only select one value
01:06 - let's just refresh we can only select
01:08 - one value between 1 and 400 now what
01:12 - happens if we want to select a range for
01:14 - example between a certain amount of
01:17 - pounds and then another button just like
01:20 - this between a higher amount for example
01:23 - well we can use the range and we can set
01:27 - this to true now by default this isn't
01:29 - going to look very nice it's just gonna
01:31 - not really work so nothing's really
01:34 - working and this is because we need to
01:36 - define the values that we are starting
01:37 - at so I'm going to define the values and
01:40 - this is an array of integer so let's say
01:43 - 0 and 10 or 20 and 40 for example when
01:49 - we refresh you can see I will need a
01:52 - comma just after that separator you can
01:55 - see that we now have between 20 here and
01:58 - 40 here however when we move this one we
02:02 - get the result that we want when we move
02:04 - this one you know it doesn't really look
02:07 - very nice so we're getting the the value
02:10 - of the absolute value of this first one
02:12 - however this were getting the other
02:13 - value which we don't want we want it to
02:16 - say between this and between this so we
02:20 - need to go ahead and change this value
02:21 - here so what I'm going to do is I'm
02:25 - going to first of all change this two
02:27 - values and then I'm accessing the first
02:30 - key of these two values and then get it
02:33 - append on to and then another pound sign
02:36 - and then I'm going to append on you i
02:41 - dot values and you probably guessed
02:44 - accessing key one this now represents
02:48 - this first here and this now represents
02:53 - this here so we've accessed values as
02:57 - opposed to the actual value of it and
03:00 - we're returning both of the values so
03:03 - now it will be updated to between 19 or
03:07 - 19 and 40 so we could say one to a
03:11 - hundred and something or we could get
03:14 - say sixty two three hundred and
03:17 - something for example so now we're
03:19 - accessing the two points of the slider
03:20 - so this would be useful as I mentioned
03:23 - earlier in the tutorial for something
03:25 - like defining a price between a price
03:28 - range so if you are using this on a
03:30 - retail website you might want to only
03:33 - list items between 1 and then 10 pounds
03:36 - so it's extremely useful in this sense
03:40 - as well now we can also look at other
03:43 - types of bars by changing the
03:44 - orientation so what I'm going to do is
03:47 - I'm just going to go ahead and change
03:49 - this back to value and I'm going to get
03:54 - rid of this pound sign here and let's go
03:58 - ahead and refresh so now we've got that
04:01 - let's go ahead and get rid of values and
04:03 - get rid of range I'm going to set the
04:07 - maximum value to 100 and refresh so now
04:10 - we've got a simple slider with the range
04:13 - between 1 and 100 now what if I wanted
04:16 - to set the orientation to this to make
04:18 - it a vertical bar so orientation
04:22 - and in here we define vertical so there
04:25 - are a few options for this but I'm gonna
04:27 - go forward vertical here remember
04:29 - comment separate that there when i
04:31 - refresh my height it's not work - let's
04:34 - have a look what we've done wrong oh
04:40 - okay yeah so I've spelled vertical wrong
04:42 - so vertical okay so now you'll see that
04:45 - we've got a vertical bar and when we go
04:47 - up you can see that this value changes
04:49 - as well so we've now got from 1 to 100
04:52 - we've created a vertical bar as well on
04:55 - the jQuery UI documentation it shows a
04:58 - volume mixer as an example which is a I
05:01 - guess a good example of this so there's
05:04 - some obviously practical applications to
05:07 - this depending on what application you
05:10 - are creating so we've essentially
05:13 - covered the basics of the slider there
05:16 - are many more options and obviously more
05:18 - events that you can choose from however
05:20 - if you were to say create something like
05:22 - this and you wanted to implement this
05:24 - value into a database for example or
05:26 - perform a search query when we had the
05:29 - with the vertical bar early horizontal
05:32 - bar sorry you can easily use this slide
05:35 - function or the stop function we also
05:38 - have a stop function as well so when the
05:41 - slider has stopped you could then
05:42 - implement the value into this as well so
05:45 - let's take a look at this quickly I'm
05:48 - gonna create a new event called stop and
05:50 - I'm gonna create a function from this
05:53 - and we're going to alert UI dot value so
05:59 - essentially what you might do here is
06:01 - then implement a value into the database
06:03 - or perform something else
06:05 - when we've stopped us when we've stopped
06:07 - scrolling so now what's going to happen
06:09 - is when I stop scrolling nothing's
06:11 - happened and that's because I need event
06:17 - and UI just in there so we're accessing
06:19 - UI dot value when I stop scrolling you
06:23 - see that we have a dialog box of 49
06:25 - which is the position that we've left
06:27 - this hour this could then be implemented
06:29 - elsewhere for example if you were say
06:32 - allowing user to scroll with the amount
06:34 - of money
06:35 - say they wanted to borrow you could pass
06:37 - this as a variable on to a next page or
06:39 - if it was for example I've no select
06:42 - your age it could be anything like that
06:44 - you would then on the stop event you
06:47 - would implement this into the database
06:49 - or again store it into a session
06:52 - variable
06:52 - obviously the a protocol applications of
06:55 - this are limitless however for now
06:58 - that's just a basic outline and a few of
07:01 - the options and a couple of the events
07:03 - with the slider widget in jQuery UI
