00:00 - what's going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - 14th JavaScript tutorial and in this
00:05 - tutorial I'm going to start off teaching
00:06 - you guys something called an if
00:08 - statement and then we're going to learn
00:10 - about something called comparison
00:11 - operators so basically an if statement
00:15 - is a really simple way to have your
00:17 - computer make a decision you're going to
00:19 - give it a scenario and if it's true it's
00:23 - going to run a bit of code for example
00:24 - if you say if the variable called Bucky
00:27 - is equal to 24 then run this of code if
00:30 - it's not then don't do anything so
00:33 - really simple decision so let's go ahead
00:34 - and do that right now let's go ahead and
00:37 - make two variables and later on we'll
00:39 - compare them to each other so make a
00:41 - variable name apples and set this equal
00:44 - to you know 20 or 34 whatever and make a
00:48 - ver another variable called hot dogs and
00:50 - set this equal to like 53 it doesn't
00:53 - matter what numbers they are as long as
00:54 - they don't equal each other so we have
00:57 - two variables we already know what those
00:59 - do now let's go ahead and look at the
01:01 - basic Syntax for an if statement now the
01:04 - if statement is set up like this all of
01:06 - the time have the word if right there
01:08 - and then go ahead and write two
01:10 - parentheses after that now inside these
01:13 - parentheses is where you're going to be
01:14 - making your comparison you're going to
01:16 - say all right if apples is equal to hot
01:18 - dogs if apples is greater than hot dogs
01:21 - if apples is less than hot dogs and all
01:24 - that stuff you're going to be comparing
01:25 - one thing against another now if that
01:28 - comparison is true it's going to go
01:30 - ahead and run the bit of code in between
01:33 - these curly brackets so go ahead and
01:35 - throw those in so basically if
01:38 - statements work like this it's going to
01:40 - test something right here and if that
01:43 - test is true or if they do match each
01:45 - other it's going to run this bit of code
01:47 - so let's go ahead and give it something
01:48 - really simple to run run
01:52 - document. write
01:56 - um yay it worked something stupid like
01:59 - that
02:00 - so let's go ahead and give it a simple
02:03 - comparison right now and you may be
02:05 - thinking right this all right a simple
02:07 - comparison would make sense like apples
02:10 - equals hot dogs I mean make one thing
02:13 - equal to another and that's a test
02:15 - that's how I did it in math class that's
02:17 - how it works but whenever we make a
02:19 - comparison we have to follow one simple
02:21 - rule we can't use a single equal sign
02:24 - ever because JavaScript already uses
02:27 - single equal sign whenever it sets a
02:29 - variable
02:30 - equal to a value so whenever you're
02:32 - comparing two values you need to have
02:35 - two equal signs and now you're testing
02:37 - all right does the value of apples equal
02:40 - the value of hot dogs in other words
02:43 - does 34 equal 53 if 34 does equal 53
02:48 - it's going to pron out yay it worked if
02:50 - it doesn't equal 53 or if they don't
02:53 - equal each other nothing's going to
02:54 - happen so since they don't equal each
02:56 - other let's go ahead and refresh and
02:59 - nothing happen happens so let's go ahead
03:01 - and change these values to make apples
03:03 - equal 53 and hot dogs equal 53 so now
03:07 - apples does indeed equal hot dogs so
03:11 - this is going to be true and since this
03:13 - is true this is going to run so let's go
03:16 - ahead and save this refresh it and check
03:19 - it out yay it worked so now we can see
03:22 - the basics of an if statement it's
03:24 - basically this again you you test what
03:28 - is called a condition now this condition
03:31 - is going to be true if it's true and
03:34 - it's going to be false if it's not true
03:37 - if they equal each other in this case
03:38 - it's going to be true if they don't it's
03:40 - going to be false anytime it's true this
03:43 - bit of code is going to run any time
03:45 - it's false nothing's going to happen so
03:48 - you're basically giving your computer a
03:50 - decision to make if this is true run
03:53 - this if it's not don't do
03:55 - anything so aside from this double equal
03:58 - sign we know that we can use the double
04:01 - equal sign to tell JavaScript compare
04:04 - two things we can also give it a couple
04:06 - other symbols we can say explanation
04:09 - point equals and what this means is if
04:12 - apples doesn't equal hot dogs go ahead
04:15 - and print this out so check this out
04:18 - since they are alike and they do equal
04:20 - each other then this is going to be
04:24 - false since well let me go ahead and run
04:27 - this and show you guys nothing happens
04:30 - right here so why is this false well
04:34 - does apples not equal hot dogs no they
04:37 - do equal each other so it's false so
04:40 - this is a way of saying all right if
04:42 - apples is not equal to hot dogs do this
04:45 - so when exactly would this pronounce say
04:47 - you had 53 and 99 well now they don't
04:52 - equal each other so this statement is
04:54 - true and since this is true I'm going to
04:57 - go ahead and print this out and worked
05:00 - so another thing that we can do is I
05:03 - showed you guys how to make it equals
05:05 - and how to make it not equals so you can
05:07 - of course use greater than and less than
05:10 - these are really easy ones if apples is
05:12 - greater than hot dogs AKA if 53 is
05:16 - greater than 99 print this out so can
05:19 - you guys guess what's going to happen it
05:21 - doesn't print it out because 53 is not
05:24 - higher than 99 and again I don't need to
05:28 - show you this but I might as well do it
05:29 - anyways if 53 is less than 99 which is
05:34 - indeed true since this statement is true
05:37 - then this is going to print out just
05:39 - like that so that's is why when I
05:41 - refresh it it prints out so those are
05:44 - the four most common but I also need to
05:47 - uh include one other thing you can also
05:50 - have uh greater than or equals to and
05:53 - this say if it's greater than or if it
05:57 - is equals to like 53 and 53 would work
06:00 - and also 56 is greater than or equal to
06:05 - 53 but so just uh verify that it does
06:08 - work there you go right there and also
06:12 - you have less than and equals to so in
06:15 - any scenario where apples is less than
06:17 - or equal to Hot Dogs which it would be
06:19 - false in this case because 56 is not
06:22 - less than or equal to Hot Dogs whenever
06:24 - you save it it doesn't work so check it
06:26 - out so those are the basic ones you
06:30 - there are a couple other ones but I
06:32 - don't want to confuse you guys for now
06:33 - so in when you want to compare two
06:35 - values to each other use double equal
06:38 - signs when you want to make sure that
06:40 - they're not equal to each other use
06:41 - explanation point equal sign and then
06:44 - you have your Basics greater than less
06:46 - than greater than or equal to less than
06:48 - or equal to so that's basics of what an
06:51 - if statement is it pretty much test
06:53 - something and if it's true it runs a
06:56 - little bit of code so now you understand
06:59 - what conditional operators are or excuse
07:02 - me comparison operators and also the if
07:04 - statement so in the next tutorial we're
07:06 - going to be going over kind of a more
07:09 - complex if statement but it's probably
07:11 - going to be the one that you're going to
07:12 - be using more often so it's actually not
07:15 - that difficult to learn if you can
07:17 - understand this then the next thing is
07:19 - going to be a breeze so anyways thank
07:20 - you guys for watching don't forget to
07:22 - subscribe and I'll see you guys later
