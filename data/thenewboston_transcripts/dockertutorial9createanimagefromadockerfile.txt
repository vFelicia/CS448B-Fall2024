00:00 - all right yeah welcome back to another
00:02 - tutorial and in this lesson
00:04 - we are going to be taking a look at how
00:06 - to create images from
00:07 - a docker file now in the last video
00:11 - we already covered how to create images
00:13 - so why do we need to know this new
00:15 - process
00:16 - well admittedly the last technique it
00:19 - wasn't
00:19 - the best it was a bit manual not very
00:22 - scalable
00:23 - it was error prone and to be honest it's
00:26 - just easy to forget the steps
00:28 - like if someone asked me tomorrow how
00:30 - did you create that image i'm gonna have
00:31 - to remember everything
00:32 - and count on my memory is never a good
00:35 - idea
00:36 - so instead what we can use is something
00:37 - called a docker file
00:39 - and this is all it is is really just the
00:41 - configuration file to tell docker
00:43 - how it should create our image and in
00:45 - very basic terms it allows us to replace
00:48 - everything that we did in the last video
00:50 - with one file
00:52 - all right sounds pretty cool so let's
00:54 - get to it now the first thing we're
00:56 - actually going to need is
00:57 - a new empty folder a new empty directory
01:00 - so i'm just going to cd
01:01 - to my desktop and all right so let me
01:05 - just make a directory called
01:07 - temp and cd into temp
01:11 - all right so ls nothing in here i'm in a
01:14 - brand new directory called temp
01:16 - what i want to do now is i just want to
01:18 - create the actual
01:19 - text file called dockerfile so i'm going
01:22 - to use nano since
01:24 - you know everyone uh watching can follow
01:26 - along
01:27 - and the name of this file is docker file
01:30 - it doesn't have any extension you need
01:32 - to make sure that the case is proper
01:34 - uppercase d not txt not docker not
01:37 - anything just create a file called
01:39 - docker file that's it now before we get
01:42 - into the meat of what is going to go
01:44 - into this file
01:45 - i want to kind of talk about how i
01:47 - visualize it in my head
01:49 - whenever i'm creating a docker file i
01:51 - imagine it like i'm turning on a
01:53 - computer for the very first time
01:55 - i just installed everything hooked up
01:57 - the power supply
01:58 - plugged it into the wall hit the on
02:00 - button and there you go
02:02 - so we have a blank computer it doesn't
02:03 - have operating system installed it
02:05 - doesn't
02:06 - have any software it doesn't have
02:07 - anything just a plain blank computer
02:10 - so kind of like the last video the first
02:13 - thing that we need to do
02:14 - is install our base image or in other
02:17 - words our base
02:18 - operating system so very first line
02:21 - we're going to use the keyword
02:23 - from to do this this means
02:26 - what is your base image or your starting
02:28 - point that you want to start from
02:31 - so we can just go ahead and stick with
02:34 - alpine
02:35 - just to keep things uh completely the
02:37 - same as last video we can do latest
02:39 - just like that so what we have to do
02:41 - after we have alpine installed
02:43 - or think of it like we now have linux
02:46 - running on our computer
02:47 - is we can install redis now we are going
02:50 - to use the run command
02:51 - for this so what the run command
02:54 - does is it executes the following
02:56 - command which we're going to be typing
02:58 - right after this
02:59 - and executes it on top of the current
03:02 - image
03:03 - which in our case is alpine right now so
03:06 - remember got a fire truck going on
03:08 - outside
03:12 - why are there always like emergencies
03:15 - whenever i'm recording a video i'm not
03:16 - even gonna pause it i'm just going to
03:17 - let it roll whatever
03:19 - all right so pretty much installed
03:22 - alpine and then on top of that we're
03:24 - going to install
03:24 - redis again went over this part in the
03:27 - last tutorial so
03:28 - don't need to walk through apk or
03:29 - anything now the last
03:32 - command is ironically cmd which stands
03:35 - for command
03:37 - and this is basically our startup
03:38 - command so even though
03:40 - redis is installed right here this
03:42 - basically is just going to install the
03:44 - software but it's not actually going to
03:45 - turn on
03:46 - the program so in order to do that for
03:49 - our startup command
03:50 - use square brackets then you know just
03:53 - quotes like you're writing out a string
03:54 - we're going to have the startup command
03:56 - of redis server
03:58 - now another thing that i want to point
03:59 - out super quick is you can also have
04:02 - any comments in there and typically in
04:04 - the dockerfile you're going to see lots
04:05 - of comments
04:06 - but um yeah not really necessary want to
04:09 - keep this one bare bones
04:10 - also i'm talking through everything so
04:12 - no really need for that
04:15 - all right so now we have our darker file
04:16 - with three commands
04:18 - there are actually more commands in
04:20 - addition to from run
04:21 - and command but we'll get into those
04:23 - later on for right now let's just go
04:25 - ahead and save it using
04:27 - depending on what system you're on
04:28 - control command x
04:30 - and then just do enter all right so now
04:32 - we have a docker file
04:34 - cat docker file there we go what do we
04:36 - do with it now
04:37 - well with this docker file we can
04:39 - actually build an image from it
04:40 - right away and it's actually very easy
04:43 - to do that
04:44 - once you have your docker file all you
04:46 - write is docker build
04:48 - and the last thing is a path to the
04:51 - directory where your docker file is but
04:53 - since it's in the same directory that
04:55 - we're at
04:55 - we can just use the dot which is
04:57 - basically a current directory
04:59 - and hit enter all right it looked like
05:03 - something happened and okay row image
05:06 - this looks promising
05:07 - so let me just clear this and see what
05:09 - happened if i go to docker image
05:11 - ls all right so we got our alpine
05:14 - in bucky's image and these were the ones
05:17 - from the last tutorial so this one must
05:18 - be the new one
05:20 - and let me just check all right writing
05:22 - image 52c852c8 okay
05:25 - so this top one is the new one however
05:28 - repository none tag none it's just a
05:31 - little bit hard to
05:32 - identify right now so what i want to do
05:35 - is actually remove this
05:36 - and i'm going to rebuild it and show you
05:38 - guys an easier way
05:39 - that you can identify it later on so let
05:43 - me just copy this
05:43 - image id right now and i'm going to do
05:46 - docker
05:47 - image remove i'm going to force
05:50 - removal of 523c
05:53 - so there you go deleted it and now if i
05:55 - do docker image ls okay
05:57 - so we verify that it's gone now let's go
06:00 - ahead and rebuild it
06:02 - so i'll show you guys the old command
06:05 - all right so before we did this
06:07 - docker build period let's just
06:10 - build it with the default settings but
06:12 - now
06:13 - since whenever we build it this way the
06:15 - repository and the tag are
06:17 - it makes it difficult to identify that
06:19 - image what we can do instead is pass in
06:21 - the dash
06:22 - t flag what this does is it gives you
06:24 - the ability to tag
06:26 - your image with a more human readable
06:28 - friendly name
06:30 - now the naming convention is typically
06:32 - your docker id
06:33 - and mine is the new boston and then
06:36 - forward slash
06:36 - your project name and mine is just let's
06:39 - name it buckys
06:41 - redis and we'll say that this is the
06:43 - latest right there
06:45 - so again all that change from the last
06:48 - build from this one is we included this
06:50 - dash t and you can really tag it
06:53 - anything you want but this is just kind
06:54 - of
06:55 - convention and again don't forget this
06:58 - period at the end
06:59 - we're building it from the same file
07:00 - just tagging it something different
07:02 - hit enter and all right so now if we go
07:05 - to docker image ls
07:08 - let me just expand this bad boy a little
07:11 - bit all right
07:12 - so now instead of none none we now have
07:14 - the new boston
07:15 - bucky's redis and latest
07:18 - tag now of course just to
07:21 - make sure that everything is good to go
07:23 - and we can actually run a container
07:25 - out of this image just clear out of this
07:28 - and we can do
07:29 - docker container run and then we're
07:32 - going to paste in
07:33 - the new boston slash bucky's redis and
07:35 - hopefully once i hit enter
07:37 - nothing explodes and boom look at that
07:40 - so there you go ladies and gentlemen
07:42 - that is how you create an image
07:44 - with a docker file again there's more to
07:46 - it
07:47 - lots of different keywords settings to
07:49 - learn so on and so forth but that is the
07:51 - basics
07:51 - so for now thank you guys for watching
07:53 - don't forget to subscribe
07:55 - and as always i will see you guys later
