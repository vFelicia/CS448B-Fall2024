00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - working more on the personal application
00:09 - now what we're going to be doing in this
00:11 - tutorial is getting the selected person
00:14 - from our list and updating the current
00:17 - wait money and income based on the
00:20 - person that I selected and we can have
00:22 - them do any of these subs right here so
00:25 - go ahead and double click on list people
00:29 - and it will open up the selected index
00:32 - change so now we need to do is use a
00:35 - simple if statement so if list people
00:38 - dot selected index there's not equal
00:42 - negative one then go ahead and do
00:44 - something so if they're if they selected
00:47 - anything on here it will not equal
00:49 - negative one if nothing is selected then
00:52 - this whatever is inside of this if
00:55 - statement will not run now we need to do
00:58 - is we need to get the person that has
01:01 - been selected so we'll go ahead and type
01:06 - dim selected person as person so we
01:15 - declared a selected person as a person
01:17 - and notice that we didn't set a we
01:21 - didn't use a new keyword to create a new
01:23 - person we're going to set this person
01:25 - equal to my people dot and we'll come
01:31 - down here and you can see that we've got
01:33 - a whole bunch of stuff that we can use
01:34 - and we're going to use index of
01:53 - so we're going to type my people and
01:56 - then we're going to add two parentheses
01:59 - now we are going to reference an index
02:01 - in my people and the index that we're
02:04 - going to use is list people that
02:08 - selected index so whatever the whatever
02:17 - the whatever is selected inside of this
02:21 - list box right here is going to be set
02:23 - to selected person so it's going to
02:26 - reference my people which is our array
02:30 - list at index of list people that
02:32 - selected index so the index of this is
02:34 - going to match the index of that and
02:36 - when we add the people to the list
02:39 - they're added in numerical order so we
02:41 - have Jama index of zero it will also be
02:44 - index of zero in the array list so index
02:46 - of zero on their list and then the array
02:48 - list so they're going to match and we
02:49 - can use list people that selecting index
02:52 - for this I might be a little confusing
02:54 - at first but you'll pick it up later on
02:57 - okay so now we need to do is we need to
03:00 - call the update all but you can see that
03:08 - under here on update money and update
03:12 - way and update update income you can see
03:15 - that we have a problem
03:18 - it will only update for the my default
03:20 - person now what we need to do is we need
03:23 - to by reference person as person so we
03:33 - will reference a person object that is
03:35 - created so now we're going to do is we
03:38 - are going to delete this right here and
03:40 - we will type person dot get money dot to
03:47 - string so instead of making a copy of
03:51 - the person object that we have declared
03:53 - right here we're going to actually use
03:56 - that person object which is referencing
03:59 - it so if we make any changes to this
04:01 - selected person it's going to
04:05 - change it if we make any changes inside
04:08 - of this sub it's going to change it down
04:09 - here so we'll go ahead and minimize that
04:14 - and we'll do that for each one of these
04:16 - right here so we will by ref person as
04:20 - person and we'll do it again
04:24 - for update income so by ref person as
04:31 - person okay so now we'll just go ahead
04:36 - and change this to person dot get income
04:47 - person
04:49 - and then this one to person get wait
04:56 - okay so now that we've updated this to
04:59 - let us reference a person object in our
05:01 - update weight update income and update
05:04 - money we're going to need to do that for
05:06 - the update all and you can see that
05:09 - we're already getting an error so under
05:10 - update all will have it reference a will
05:15 - by ref person as person and down here
05:22 - we'll just type in person person and
05:27 - person again so whoever we whatever
05:32 - person we reference to the update all is
05:35 - going to be referenced to each one of
05:36 - these and it's going to update our text
05:38 - boxes and we'll just type selected
05:42 - person right here
05:49 - now there's going to be one problem that
05:51 - we have with this since we declared
05:53 - selected person inside of the list
05:56 - people got selected index change where
05:58 - we are not going to be able to use that
06:00 - outside of this sub when we need to be
06:02 - using it inside of button income click
06:06 - button exercise click and button work
06:09 - click and you can see we're already
06:11 - getting errors right here because we
06:12 - have not referenced a person so we'll go
06:16 - ahead and copy this right here and we're
06:21 - going to declare it outside of all of
06:24 - these subs just inside our class so type
06:26 - private a selected person as person so
06:32 - now whenever the index has changed it's
06:34 - going to set that to the current person
06:40 - and so now what we're going to do is we
06:43 - are just going under update all we're
06:47 - going to reference selected person and
06:51 - before we do that we need to take this
06:54 - out right here because it has already
06:57 - been declared okay so we will update all
07:03 - for the selected person
07:13 - and selected person selected person
07:20 - again and then one more time for the
07:24 - income okay so now that we've done that
07:32 - what it's going to do is going to update
07:34 - each one of these for the selected
07:35 - person but you can see right here that
07:38 - we have my default person instead of
07:42 - selected person so we'll just go ahead
07:43 - and type that in right there and just to
07:49 - make this go a little bit quicker I'll
07:50 - copy this so copy that right there
07:59 - Oh
