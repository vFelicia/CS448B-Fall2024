00:00 - this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:03 - and in this video creative for the New
00:04 - Boston I'm going to be talking to you
00:06 - about substring replace now substring
00:11 - replace looks like this this is how we
00:16 - call the function in PHP now substring
00:20 - replace takes up to four arguments the
00:23 - first argument that we take is the
00:26 - string that we want to look at the
00:29 - second argument is the string that we
00:31 - want to replace the third argument is
00:35 - where we want to start and the fourth
00:37 - argument is where we want to end how
00:40 - many characters or how many I guess
00:44 - length if you like the length of the
00:46 - replacement now let's have a look at
00:50 - what this white basically does first
00:54 - substring replace like I said is a
00:56 - combination of substring and STR replace
01:00 - so we have substring and PHP which will
01:04 - return a specific part of a string so we
01:10 - could specify in a string let's say if
01:15 - we had a string Alex if I wanted to
01:19 - start at zero one and go to characters
01:23 - we were we would return e x so that's
01:27 - substring STR replace will find a string
01:31 - within a string and it will replace it
01:34 - with a specified string so substring
01:38 - replace is really a combination of these
01:40 - two functions so why would we need this
01:43 - we need this because we're searching for
01:46 - something but what we're then doing is
01:49 - we're we're replacing we're replacing
01:53 - the string with a specified amount of
01:56 - data so for example if you wanted to cut
01:59 - a string in half this would be a
02:02 - function to use if you wanted to say in
02:06 - fact no sorry if you wanted to cut a
02:09 - string in half you could use substring
02:10 - but with substring replace
02:13 - it will search for a string but only
02:17 - within a specified portion of a string
02:20 - so let's create a string now that we can
02:23 - work with to show this example off I'm
02:27 - going to choose this part don't search
02:34 - let's just put a slash there this part
02:41 - search now what's the idea of this
02:45 - example I'm going to not include this
02:49 - part of the string I don't want this
02:51 - part of the string to be searched in
02:53 - however I want this part of the string
02:56 - to be searched in and what I want to do
02:59 - is I want to replace part with another
03:04 - word so let's create a new variable
03:08 - called string underscore new and this is
03:12 - going to be equal to calling substring
03:15 - replace now we can start putting the
03:17 - arguments in it to start putting this
03:19 - into practice so the first argument is
03:24 - easy we just need to supply the string
03:27 - that we want to look in the second is
03:32 - and we need to put in the string that we
03:37 - want to replace so I want to replace
03:47 - part this word here with something else
03:54 - so let's just say part No we'll just say
04:04 - yeah mmm Alex I can't think of any
04:08 - better examples so the next argument we
04:14 - need to give is where to start looking
04:16 - so or where we start want to replace so
04:22 - if we count up the characters we're
04:24 - going to say 1 2 and B 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
04:30 - 9 10 11 12
04:31 - I'm not sure if that's counted 13 14 15
04:35 - 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28
04:41 - 29 so this will either be 29 or 30 I
04:45 - think and then how many characters or
04:50 - will the length of where we want to
04:51 - search that's 4 because we've got 4
04:53 - characters in part so let's have a look
04:56 - now at string new and see what's
04:58 - happened it's quite hard to come up with
05:01 - an example with something for this but
05:03 - when you do need it you'll say oh that
05:05 - would be useful so yeah okay so this is
05:09 - worked I counted correctly so now we're
05:11 - saying this part don't search this Alex
05:13 - search so we haven't actually searched
05:16 - but we've rather specified where we want
05:19 - to replace within the string now why
05:21 - would this be useful and where would
05:23 - this be use for in a real-life example
05:24 - let's say we had a forum where a user
05:28 - could like in a word processing like on
05:33 - a word processor you can search and
05:35 - replace we've already covered searching
05:38 - within a string so if we were to search
05:40 - within this string and look for part we
05:43 - could then find out that part is located
05:46 - at point 29 at location 29 we could then
05:52 - say well we've searched for part the
05:54 - word part is four characters long so
05:57 - then you can take in user input
06:00 - and specify what you'd like to replace
06:04 - so in this particular tutorial I won't
06:07 - be demonstrating that however there is
06:09 - another tutorial where we create the
06:10 - exact program that I've just talked
06:12 - about all the scripts that I've just
06:14 - talked about so these are the
06:16 - fundamentals of STL substring replace
06:19 - but in the other tutorial we're going to
06:22 - look at how we can put this into
06:23 - practice and how it might be useful
