00:00 - today our focus is
00:04 - parallelograms and like the name
00:07 - suggests opposite sides are parallel
00:10 - that's how it so a d and BC are
00:16 - parallel a a b and d c are
00:22 - parallel opposite sides are congruent so
00:26 - AB is congruent to
00:28 - DC BC is congruent to a
00:32 - d opposite angles are congruent so angle
00:36 - B is congruent to angle D angle a is
00:38 - congruent to angle C and consecutive
00:41 - angles which remember are side by side
00:44 - angles are supplementary so these
00:48 - two are
00:52 - supplementary as well as these two and
00:55 - these two and those
00:58 - two so
01:01 - if
01:02 - AB is equal to
01:04 - 8 then
01:07 - DC is equal to what well since it's a
01:12 - parallelogram and we know that
01:15 - parallelograms opposite sides are
01:17 - congruent
01:18 - DC also has to equal 8 the measure of a
01:23 - d is
01:25 - 11 so the measure of BC which is
01:28 - opposite it has to be 11 as
01:31 - well the measure of angle
01:38 - one so the measure of angle b equals
01:42 - 47 so this right here equals
01:45 - 47 measure of angle D has to equal what
01:51 - well since we know that opposite side
01:53 - opposite angles are congruent angle D
01:56 - has to equal
01:58 - 47° so the measure of angle C has to
02:01 - equal well consecutive sides or excuse
02:06 - me consecutive angles are supplementary
02:10 - so we set 47 plus the measure of angle c
02:14 - equal to 180 so the measure of angle C
02:19 - is
02:24 - 133° we got some more problems to do so
02:28 - a d is congruent
02:31 - to b
02:35 - c angle a is congruent to the angle
02:39 - opposite which is angle C the measure of
02:42 - angle a plus what is equal to 1880 well
02:47 - there's actually two different angles
02:49 - that could fit
02:50 - here so it's consecutive angles that are
02:54 - congruent so A and D are consecutive
02:57 - angles and a and b are consecutive
03:01 - angles so since they're supplementary we
03:04 - can say the measure of angle a plus the
03:06 - measure of angle D equals 180 or the
03:10 - measure of angle a plus the measure of
03:12 - angle B also equals
03:16 - 180 DC is congruent to the side opposite
03:21 - it which is
03:23 - AB the measure of angle B is congruent
03:27 - to the angle opposite that so angle
03:33 - D so now what we're going to talk about
03:37 - is diagonals of
03:40 - parallelograms so a diagonal of a
03:42 - parallelogram which is
03:44 - drawn through opposite angles divides
03:48 - the parallelogram into two equal
03:51 - triangles so if we're looking at
03:55 - this if we're looking at
03:58 - this diagonal
04:02 - first this triangle formed right
04:06 - here is congruent to this
04:10 - triangle formed right
04:13 - here and if we're looking at the other
04:16 - diagonal right
04:18 - here this triangle right here is
04:22 - congruent to this triangle right
04:26 - here the diagonals also B BCT each other
04:31 - and bisect right here if you don't know
04:33 - what it means already it means cuts into
04:36 - two equal parts so if I call this point
04:39 - right here Point
04:42 - F that means that if I'm looking at this
04:46 - lighter blue diagonal
04:49 - first
04:53 - that that this
04:55 - part is equal to this part or if I'm
04:59 - looking at this dark blue diagonal this
05:02 - part is equal to this
05:05 - part so now we're going to do some
05:07 - examples using that
05:10 - information so we know
05:14 - that triangle
05:17 - BCA which
05:19 - is formed by this solid diagonal right
05:24 - here that's going to be congruent to
05:28 - this triangle over
05:30 - here so triangle BCA is congruent to
05:37 - Triangle
05:39 - d c
05:43 - a triangle AB
05:46 - D which is formed by this dotted
05:51 - diagonal AB
05:53 - D is congruent
05:57 - to Triangle DC d
06:01 - a so if
06:04 - this right here equals 5 what does this
06:07 - part equal well like we said we said
06:10 - that when these diagonals cross each
06:12 - other they bict each other so when they
06:15 - bisect to each other they cut them into
06:17 - two equal pieces so if this side equals
06:20 - five then a EC also has to equal five so
06:24 - Point e is the midpoint of what two
06:28 - lines
06:30 - the midpoint is literally just the
06:38 - point
06:40 - point in the
06:42 - center of a
06:45 - line and we know that it's a midpoint
06:48 - because the lines the line segments are
06:54 - equal so Point e is the midpoint of this
06:57 - diagonal AC right
07:01 - and this
07:04 - diagonal b d because it cuts this line
07:09 - into two equal pieces as
07:12 - well so we went over this today so that
07:16 - in the next lesson when we talk about
07:19 - special kinds of
07:20 - parallelograms we already have a
07:23 - ground knowledge so make sure you come
