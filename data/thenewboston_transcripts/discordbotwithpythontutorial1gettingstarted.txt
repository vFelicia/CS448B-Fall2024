00:00 - what up what up welcome back everyone to
00:02 - another tutorial series and in this one
00:05 - we are going to be learning how to
00:06 - create discord bots
00:08 - now
00:09 - just as a heads up you are going to have
00:11 - to have a basic knowledge of python
00:14 - and also some kind of familiarity with
00:16 - discord and by that i just mean if you
00:19 - ever use discord before then you're
00:21 - going to be good you just can't be
00:22 - coming into it you know empty-handed but
00:25 - in terms of python if you ever set up a
00:27 - basic project before and you know what
00:28 - variables and functions are you're going
00:30 - to be good
00:32 - now another thing that i want to mention
00:34 - before we get started is that if you
00:36 - have any questions throughout the
00:38 - tutorial series then what you can do is
00:40 - you can sign up for the new boston
00:41 - discord and there's a link in the
00:44 - youtube description below so go ahead
00:45 - and click that to join
00:47 - and then if you go to the tech
00:50 - discord bot in here it's empty right now
00:53 - because i just created it but
00:55 - if anyone has any questions suggestions
00:58 - even feedback feel free to leave it in
01:00 - here
01:01 - and with that said let's go ahead and
01:03 - get started
01:04 - so the very first thing that we're
01:06 - actually going to do is we are going to
01:08 - create a new server and this discord
01:11 - server is going to be the testing
01:12 - grounds for our bot development
01:15 - somewhere we can play around with and uh
01:17 - you know like i said just test
01:18 - everything out
01:20 - so click the button right here this plus
01:22 - button
01:23 - and i'm just going to hit create my own
01:26 - server
01:27 - now you can actually skip all these
01:28 - questions if you want
01:30 - and for the server's name let's just do
01:33 - something like a
01:38 - tnb tnb tutorials
01:41 - all right looks good enough so go ahead
01:44 - and hit create and there you go
01:46 - so really in these tutorials it's
01:49 - probably only going to be me and my
01:50 - button here
01:52 - so as you can see now it's empty that's
01:54 - fine for now
01:55 - next thing we're going to have to do is
01:57 - go ahead and set up our bot and we're
01:59 - going to do this through the discord
02:01 - developer portal
02:03 - so go ahead and open browser
02:05 - and the url at this point in time i
02:08 - don't know if they're going to change it
02:09 - in the future but it's just discord.com
02:12 - developers slash applications
02:15 - and it may ask you to log in just log in
02:18 - with your regular
02:19 - discord username
02:20 - and then you're going to be taken to a
02:22 - page that looks like this
02:23 - but the first thing that we're going to
02:25 - be doing in this discord developer
02:27 - portal is just creating a new
02:30 - application
02:31 - now just to give you guys a quick
02:33 - overview of what we're about to do so we
02:35 - are about to create an application and
02:38 - then once we have our application we can
02:39 - add a bot to it and then after the bot
02:43 - permissions are set up we are just going
02:45 - to link it to our server basically to
02:47 - include our bot in the server so the
02:50 - first thing we want to do is give it a
02:51 - name and i'm just going to name this
02:53 - application tutorials bot
02:57 - so that looks good go ahead and hit
02:59 - create
03:01 - and all right looking beautiful so the
03:04 - next thing i'm actually going to want to
03:06 - do once i have this created is hop down
03:08 - to where it says bought on the left and
03:12 - we're just going to go ahead and add a
03:13 - bot
03:14 - so adding about yayada looks good let's
03:17 - do it
03:18 - a wild bot appeared sounds like a
03:21 - pokemon very cool all right so now we
03:23 - have our bot added to our application
03:26 - and before we move ahead i do want to go
03:29 - ahead and have you guys scroll down to
03:31 - this privilege gateway intent section
03:34 - now we don't actually need this for the
03:36 - first few tutorials however i'm just
03:38 - going to go ahead and have you guys
03:39 - toggle both of these on right now
03:41 - and that is presence intense and server
03:44 - member intent
03:46 - so go ahead and toggle those both on
03:49 - save those changes
03:51 - and to give you guys a quick overview
03:53 - again i don't want to get too into this
03:55 - right now but just to explain what we
03:57 - just did
03:58 - now if we click this link called gateway
04:01 - intents and this is actually something
04:02 - that just changed recently
04:05 - but
04:06 - it pretty much sums it up right here
04:08 - where
04:09 - in discord intents are groups of events
04:13 - that's it that's all you have to
04:15 - remember a discord intent is a group of
04:17 - events now what does this mean so the
04:20 - messages intents are like whenever you
04:22 - create update and delete messages so
04:25 - these are the events and they're just
04:27 - grouped together in something called an
04:29 - intent
04:30 - now something else like reactions
04:32 - whenever you
04:33 - thumbs up or thumbs down or add a smiley
04:35 - face to something
04:37 - adding those removing those removing all
04:39 - of them yada yada all of these events
04:41 - are grouped together into something
04:43 - called an intent
04:45 - now some of these intents are privileged
04:48 - which means that they just
04:50 - have some sensitive data related to it
04:52 - so discord just treats those a little
04:54 - bit special
04:56 - so that's why in here we're saying yes
04:59 - since this is a tutorial and we pretty
05:01 - much want all the privileges then we're
05:04 - just going to toggle those on right now
05:06 - so again not really important for just
05:08 - getting set up but just wanna you know
05:10 - give you guys the information of what
05:11 - we're doing
05:12 - so anyways back to this setup process
05:15 - once we have these two toggled on and
05:17 - saved let's go to oauth2
05:19 - and then
05:20 - if we scroll down
05:23 - what we want to do is in this oauth 2
05:25 - section under scopes is we want to
05:28 - select bot
05:29 - so what this is saying is what
05:31 - functionality do we want this
05:33 - application to have and since this is of
05:36 - course a discord bot tutorial it's
05:39 - pretty easy to guess that we want to
05:40 - give it bot functionality
05:42 - and another thing you guys probably
05:44 - couldn't see it because i'm a little bit
05:45 - zoomed in here
05:47 - but once we select bot right here the
05:49 - section below is going to appear called
05:51 - bot permissions
05:53 - and
05:54 - what we are going to do under bot
05:56 - permissions is just select admin
05:58 - now what this is saying i'm sure you
06:00 - guys can guess this as well is that we
06:02 - want our bot to be able to do anything a
06:04 - discord admin can do now just a heads up
06:08 - you typically do not want to choose
06:10 - administrator right here you
06:12 - typically want to limit your bot to
06:14 - whatever you actually need it to do
06:16 - whatever permissions you need to give it
06:17 - and no more however in this tutorial
06:20 - series since we're going to be touching
06:21 - a lot of different areas i'm just going
06:23 - to go ahead and give it admin permission
06:26 - so we don't have to come back and keep
06:27 - tweaking it so on and so forth but
06:29 - anyways that is what we are going to do
06:32 - to set it up
06:33 - so again scopes bought bot permissions
06:36 - admin
06:37 - and now
06:38 - the well i guess one of the last steps
06:40 - is if you copy this url right here
06:44 - then you can go ahead and open up a new
06:46 - tab in your browser and just paste this
06:49 - in
06:50 - so i'm going to go ahead and hit enter
06:52 - and this is saying that okay
06:54 - you told me that you wanted to create a
06:56 - bot now what server do you want to hook
06:59 - it up to
07:00 - and of course ours is just tmb tutorials
07:04 - the one that we just created a couple
07:05 - minutes ago go ahead and hit continue
07:08 - yep everything looks good
07:11 - and i have to make sure i am not a robot
07:14 - and all right looking good you may know
07:17 - now close this window or tab
07:20 - so i will do that
07:22 - now i'm going to pop open discord again
07:24 - and check it out
07:25 - so when you pop open discord you now are
07:28 - going to see your bot that is offline
07:30 - and that is really all we need to do for
07:32 - this initial setup going to your
07:34 - developer portal creating an application
07:37 - creating a bot and then linking your bot
07:40 - to your discord server and if all goes
07:42 - well you should see that you now have
07:44 - your bot offline again if you get lost
07:47 - in any of that or something didn't work
07:49 - out or something has changed from the
07:51 - time i made this tutorial too and you're
07:52 - watching it
07:54 - then always feel free to go in our the
07:56 - new boston discord and this discord bot
07:59 - section anyone will be able to help you
08:01 - out there's people online all the time
08:03 - so for now thank you guys for watching
08:05 - and in the next video we're going to be
08:07 - getting our hands dirty
08:08 - setting up the python source code and
08:10 - actually writing some code it's going to
08:12 - be awesome i'll see you guys then
