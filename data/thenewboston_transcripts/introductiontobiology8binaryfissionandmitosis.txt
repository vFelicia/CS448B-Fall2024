00:00 - now that we've covered cellular
00:02 - structures it's time to move on to
00:04 - Cellular division my name is Sarah and
00:06 - in this video I'm going to be talking
00:08 - about binary fision and
00:11 - mitosis despite the differences between
00:13 - procaryotic cell division and ukar cell
00:16 - division they do share some common
00:18 - features you have to have DNA
00:20 - replication you have to have segregation
00:23 - of the new DNA molecules and you have to
00:26 - have cyto Kinesis which is where these
00:28 - cells actually split apart
00:30 - procaryotic organisms are going to
00:33 - replicate by what is called binary
00:36 - fision procaryotic organisms are only
00:38 - going to have one circular chromosome so
00:41 - that's going to replicate copies of each
00:44 - chromosome are going to attach to
00:46 - different parts of the cell membrane by
00:47 - what is called a mesosome the cells are
00:50 - going to pull apart and then you have
00:53 - cytokinesis resulting in the parent cell
00:56 - which is the original cell and the
00:58 - daughter cell which is the new
01:00 - cell procaryotic division is very simple
01:03 - compared to eukaryotic cell division
01:06 - eukaryotic organisms are going to go
01:08 - through a cell cycle there are four
01:10 - phases in the cell cycle you have the G1
01:14 - phase or the Gap one phase which is
01:16 - where growth occurs and synthesis of
01:18 - molecules that the cell needs to grow
01:21 - and
01:22 - function cells that don't divide any
01:25 - longer such as neurons will be in the
01:28 - growth one phase forever they're not
01:30 - going to divide anymore they're not
01:32 - going to need to replicate their DNA or
01:34 - anything like that the S phase is called
01:37 - the DNA synthesis phase the G2 phase or
01:41 - Gap 2 phase is where the cell prepares
01:44 - prepares for mitosis and the M phase is
01:47 - the mitosis phase G1 s and G2 phases are
01:52 - collectively termed interphase which
01:55 - means the cell is not activ actively
01:57 - dividing eukaryotic cell division is
02:00 - going to involve a couple of steps
02:02 - you've got the division of the nucleus
02:04 - which is called Kinesis and then you
02:06 - have the division of the rest of the
02:08 - cell the cytoplasm and all the organel
02:10 - which is called cyto canis somatic cells
02:13 - or body cells are going to um accomplish
02:17 - Karo Kinesis by what is called mitosis
02:20 - sex cells or gates are going to
02:22 - accomplish Kinesis by what is called
02:25 - meiosis and like I said in this video
02:27 - we're going to be covering mitosis
02:29 - so before a cell can divide it has to
02:32 - replicate its DNA which is found in the
02:34 - nucleus cells do this during interphase
02:38 - during interfase the nucleus is a
02:40 - distinct organel it is bound by the
02:42 - nuclear membrane DNA exists as UK
02:45 - chromatin which is just long stringy
02:48 - strands of DNA it's not very coiled and
02:53 - it allows for transcription or the
02:55 - reading of DNA to occur so the cell can
02:58 - synthesize proteins and other molecules
03:00 - it needs to grow and function mitosis is
03:05 - the division of the nucleus it is
03:08 - composed of four different steps you've
03:10 - got prophase metaphase anaphase and tase
03:15 - the way I was always taught to remember
03:16 - this was Preta and aella it sounds kind
03:19 - of dumb but it works during prophase
03:22 - chromatin is going to condense and coil
03:26 - to form what are called chromosomes the
03:28 - nucleoli and nuclear membrane are going
03:31 - to begin to disappear centrioles if the
03:34 - cell has them are going to migrate to
03:36 - opposite ends of the cell and spinal
03:38 - fibers are going to begin to form before
03:40 - we move on to the next step there are a
03:42 - couple of vocabulary terms you need to
03:45 - somatic cells are diploid this means
03:48 - they contain two copies of every
03:50 - chromosome you've got one from the
03:51 - mother and one from the father
03:54 - chromosomes when they condense are
03:56 - composed of what are called chromatids
04:00 - for example this is a chromosome each
04:03 - half of the chromosome is a
04:05 - chromatid these are just identical
04:09 - replications
04:10 - of the same DNA so you've got one
04:14 - chromatid from your mother it replicates
04:16 - to form the chromosome which contains
04:18 - two chromatids and then one chromatid
04:22 - from your father it replicates to form
04:24 - the chromosome from your father
04:26 - chromatids are joined by what is called
04:28 - a centrom miror which is this little
04:30 - black dot in the
04:32 - middle and then you've got homologous
04:35 - chromosomes you've got the chromosome
04:37 - from your mother and the chromosome from
04:40 - your father they contain the exact same
04:43 - DNA the same genes but these genes may
04:47 - be in different forms and these
04:49 - different forms are called Al but
04:51 - anyways as you can see you've got the
04:54 - nuclear membrane is beginning to
04:56 - disappear got your cental here and and
04:59 - your spindle fibers coming out from your
05:03 - centrioles during metaphase all the
05:06 - chromosomes are going to line up in the
05:07 - middle of the cell by this time the
05:10 - nucleus has completely disappeared and
05:13 - the spindle fibers are going to begin to
05:15 - attached to centr at locations called
05:19 - kinetic cor and you can see in this
05:22 - drawing all the chromosomes are lined up
05:24 - in the middle the spindal fibers are
05:26 - attached and the nucleus nuclear MBR is
05:30 - completely gone during anaphase each
05:33 - side of the chromosome which are called
05:35 - the chromatids are going to be pulled to
05:38 - opposite sides of the
05:40 - cell see if you noticed in the last
05:43 - picture it was they were all attached
05:46 - during anaphase these two are going to
05:47 - be pulled apart and during the last
05:51 - phase of mitosis the spindle fibers are
05:53 - going to detach the cytoplasm begins to
05:56 - separate into two parts the plasma
05:58 - membrane is going to pin pch in from
06:00 - both sides and the nucleus is going to
06:03 - reform chromosomes begin to end coil new
06:06 - centrioles are formed and the cell is
06:08 - going to begin to enter reenter
06:11 - interphase and this is just a picture of
06:13 - tase you can see the plasma membrane
06:15 - begin to pinch
06:16 - in all the chromosomes excuse me
06:19 - chromatids are on opposite sides now the
06:22 - last part of cell division is cyto Canis
06:25 - which is the separation of the cytoplasm
06:28 - this is when new organel are going to be
06:30 - synthesized and it forms this thing
06:32 - called a cleavage Furrow which is when
06:34 - the cell is actually going to split and
06:36 - you can see here you've got your
06:38 - mitochondria all your others organel
06:41 - they're going to divide and each like
06:45 - the organells are just going to go to
06:48 - each new cell you've got the parent cell
06:50 - and the daughter cell but that is all I
06:53 - have for
06:54 - mitosis and cellular division for now
06:57 - but in the next video I'll cover meosis
07:00 - which is the process of division for sex
07:04 - cells
