00:00 - what hello there BL day and uh in this
00:03 - tutorial we're going to be talking about
00:05 - unordered list so our 27th tutorial and
00:09 - uh yeah it's definitely time to learn
00:11 - how to style unordered list so before we
00:14 - uh can style unordered list we probably
00:16 - would need one eh so let's go ahead and
00:18 - make an unordered list end it right
00:21 - there and add some list items in here
00:24 - and yep definitely messed that up so
00:26 - just undo that wow I'm messing like this
00:29 - whole thing up
00:30 - there we go Bucky you get it okay let's
00:33 - uh let's concentrate here enough Wally
00:35 - gagging around Li I li time to add some
00:39 - list items so the first item would be
00:41 - like apple let just go ahead and copy
00:44 - this way too lazy to type this again so
00:49 - okay what's on my mind Apple I guess we
00:52 - can make this a list of food that I like
00:54 - apple pie
00:57 - and dumplings because they sound funny
01:00 - and they taste good hm not a bad
01:03 - combination so now that we have an
01:05 - unordered list let's go ahead and check
01:07 - it out a regular dumb old list with
01:10 - these dumb old bullet points I mean this
01:12 - is a you know a nice list of food but I
01:16 - want to spice things up a bit I want to
01:17 - make this look nice and pry so the first
01:20 - thing that you might be thinking is all
01:22 - right Bucky the first thing that we need
01:24 - to do is either change these little
01:27 - bullets or uh get rid of them all
01:29 - together because because I mean this is
01:31 - old school just regular bullet holes I
01:33 - don't think so so let's go ahead and
01:35 - learn how to change our bullet points
01:38 - and in order to do that go ahead and
01:40 - write your UL is the
01:42 - element and the property in order to
01:44 - change this is called list
01:47 - minus style minus type now this has a
01:52 - bunch of uh default I mean excuse me not
01:54 - default but it has a bunch of built-in
01:57 - things I can only remember like three
01:58 - off the top of my head um let's see if I
02:00 - can remember square is one now if we go
02:04 - ahead and refresh this check it out our
02:06 - bullet holes turned to squares that's
02:09 - that's probably really hard to see on
02:11 - YouTube but I assure you they are
02:13 - squares let's go ahead and uh make
02:15 - something that's a little easier Circle
02:17 - I know was one that might be a little
02:19 - easier to
02:20 - see Circle see now you can see that
02:24 - instead of those filled in bullet holes
02:26 - they're now nice elegant looking empty
02:29 - circles so that's pretty cool and
02:31 - actually I just thought of another one
02:33 - um I don't know why I thought of this
02:34 - but it's called Katakana and you got to
02:38 - say it like that you just have to I
02:39 - didn't make the rules and if you refresh
02:42 - this you can see these I don't know I
02:44 - guess they're like Chinese or Japanese
02:45 - symbols if anyone knows what those
02:48 - symbols mean then uh leave me a comment
02:50 - below because I uh well obviously
02:54 - because I don't know what they mean and
02:55 - I want to know so anyways that is the
02:58 - basics of how you change change your
03:01 - unordered list from regular Dum mode
03:02 - bullet points to something else so
03:05 - another thing that I want to mention is
03:08 - if you go through and you see you know
03:09 - you look on the website and you go
03:12 - through looking at all the bullet points
03:13 - that you can use and none of them really
03:16 - um I I don't know tickle your feathers I
03:19 - guess none of them really make you happy
03:22 - you can go ahead and download an image
03:25 - or make an image and use them as your
03:27 - own custom bullet points so I went ahead
03:30 - and I already downloaded an image off
03:32 - the internet and it's just cool little
03:34 - check mark and if I wanted to use that
03:37 - instead of my bullet points here's what
03:38 - I would need to do first of all you
03:41 - don't use list style type anymore so go
03:43 - ahead and delete all that what you use
03:45 - is property called list
03:48 - style image and of course anytime we
03:51 - want to use the image in CSS we use the
03:53 - keyword URL with those parentheses and
03:56 - inside our parentheses I have a file
03:59 - that I already download so if you do
04:02 - this it's not going to work because this
04:04 - file isn't on your computer but anyways
04:06 - I already have this in my folder it's
04:07 - called check.
04:09 - ping so when I go ahead and save this
04:12 - and refresh it's going to go from
04:14 - Katakana to those cool little check
04:16 - marks so now you can see instead of
04:19 - those bullet points it has like my own
04:21 - custom whatever I want so I just want to
04:24 - show you guys that there is a way to uh
04:27 - you know if you're not happy with
04:28 - anything they give you by default then
04:30 - you can make your own so another thing
04:33 - that I wanted to cover in this tutorial
04:35 - maybe I'll save this for the next
04:36 - tutorial now we have got time to do it
04:38 - now um let's go ahead and delete all of
04:41 - this and add a property
04:44 - like
04:45 - border one pick solid
04:49 - red this is a problem that I had a long
04:52 - time ago and uh I remember that every
04:55 - time I made a website it would annoy me
04:56 - so I always use unordered lists when I
04:59 - have like a navigation bar on the side
05:01 - and the first thing I want to do is this
05:05 - first of all on my navigation bar I
05:07 - don't want these little bullet points so
05:10 - in order to remove those I go ahead and
05:14 - in my
05:15 - CSS I
05:17 - go list style type and I set this to
05:22 - none and I'm thinking all right whenever
05:24 - I do this the bullet points are going to
05:27 - disappear in all of these which would be
05:30 - links are going to be pushed nice and
05:31 - neatly to the left but I refresh and I
05:35 - get this problem I have this huge space
05:37 - to my left even though there are no
05:38 - bullet points I just want to like shake
05:40 - my computer and I'm like dude you don't
05:42 - have any bullet points so you don't have
05:44 - to move over so can you just hop over
05:47 - there where you should be go ahead just
05:49 - hop on over but it doesn't do that in
05:52 - order to get those to the left let me
05:55 - explain this first of all by default
05:58 - your browser gives padding at least left
06:01 - padding to unorder list um it also gives
06:05 - a margin I Believe by default so in
06:08 - order to fix the padding I mean you
06:12 - would think that it would be Zero by
06:13 - default because it just makes sense but
06:15 - it isn't in order to fix the padding you
06:18 - need to explicitly set this to zero so
06:21 - go ahead and type padding in there and
06:24 - go ahead and type zero and now once we
06:26 - go ahead and save this and refresh it
06:29 - check it out everything is pushed nice
06:31 - and neatly to the left and of course if
06:34 - this is too much for you you can alter
06:36 - the padding accordingly but I just
06:38 - wanted to show you guys whenever you
06:39 - guys are you know making a website and
06:42 - you're like hm making an unordered list
06:45 - as a navigation uh column seems like a
06:48 - good idea and you have this problem well
06:51 - now you won't have it anymore like I had
06:53 - so I uh shot myself in the foot so you
06:55 - guys wouldn't have to so uh anyways
06:58 - that's all I wanted to show you guys
06:59 - guys trying to save you a little
07:01 - headache at least um so there you have
07:03 - it so thank you guys for watching this
07:05 - tutorial um I don't know what I'm
07:07 - covering next tutorial but like always
07:09 - it's going to be amazing so uh anyways
