00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:06 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:08 - taking a look at nested if statements
00:10 - now in the last tutorial we covered else
00:12 - if statements and else and now if you
00:15 - don't know what an if statement is I
00:16 - would suggest you move on back to one of
00:17 - my earlier earlier tutorials and learn
00:21 - from that note and once you know what an
00:22 - if statement is then go ahead and move
00:24 - on to this tutorial so basically what a
00:28 - nested if statement is is that you take
00:30 - one if statement and then you put
00:32 - another if statement inside of this and
00:33 - what that does is it makes it to where
00:35 - both values have to be true for the
00:38 - condition for the program inside of the
00:40 - inner loop to run so let's go ahead and
00:43 - create a little example of this so we're
00:48 - going to go ahead and declare a variable
00:49 - and this variable is going to be their
00:52 - age so dim age as integer and we'll set
00:58 - it equal to nothing so just in case they
01:00 - don't type anything we won't get an
01:01 - error when we try to print out their age
01:03 - now we're going to create insurance so
01:07 - we're going to dim has insurance as boo
01:13 - lien and we're going to go ahead and set
01:16 - that equal to nothing too so now what
01:20 - we're going to do is we're going to ask
01:22 - them what their age is
01:23 - so we'll do console dot write line what
01:28 - is your age now we're just going to set
01:33 - the variable age to whatever they type
01:35 - in so H equals console dot readline
01:41 - now we're going to ask them if they have
01:43 - insurance so we'll do console dot write
01:48 - line
01:52 - do you have insurance true or false and
02:00 - will do has insurance equals console dot
02:05 - read line now this will not work if they
02:08 - type anything other than true or false
02:09 - your program will get an error and it
02:11 - will crash but this is just for the
02:13 - second visit of a tutorial so now we're
02:16 - going to create our if statement so if
02:21 - age equals 16 then we want to do
02:26 - whatever is inside of this if statement
02:28 - so now we're going to create an if
02:31 - statement side of this which is called
02:32 - the nested if statement so if has
02:36 - insurance equals true then we want to do
02:42 - the code inside of this will just type
02:46 - console dot write line you can drive
02:54 - legally
03:00 - now what we're going to do is we're
03:02 - going to cover the case of them not
03:05 - having surance so we're just going to go
03:07 - ahead and type else so if age is equal
03:09 - to 16 and has insurance is equal to
03:12 - false because the only other option we
03:14 - have for has insurance is false we're
03:17 - going to type console.writeline you can
03:26 - drive but don't get pulled over or you
03:35 - are screwed ok so now if we run this
03:43 - it's going to go ahead and say what is
03:46 - your age so we'll type in 16 and I'll
03:49 - say do you have insurance true or false
03:50 - so if I say true it's going to say you
03:54 - can drive but don't it'll say it'll say
03:56 - you can drive legally now you can see
03:58 - that it closed out right after we did
04:00 - that so we'll just console dot readline
04:02 - so it gives us time to read that before
04:04 - we can close the program and I'll say
04:08 - what is your age so I'll say 16 and I do
04:11 - have insurance so it'll say you can
04:13 - drive legally now if I type in 16 for
04:20 - age and false for do you have insurance
04:24 - it'll say you can drive but don't get
04:26 - pulled over or you are screwed and now
04:30 - if my age is not equal to 16 let's say
04:34 - 12 then I'll say do you have insurance
04:37 - true or false
04:38 - I say false it's not going to say
04:40 - anything because the first value is not
04:43 - true so it won't move on to the next
04:44 - stuff inside of the nested loop so what
04:50 - we're going to do is we're going to add
04:52 - a simple else right here so if H is
04:55 - equal to 16 then do the stuff in here
04:57 - and else console dot write line you
05:02 - cannot drive
05:07 - so if we type in 12 here and then type
05:11 - in false it'll say you cannot drive now
05:20 - there is a better way to do this by
05:22 - using what's called conditional
05:25 - operators and logical operators but I
05:27 - wanted to you guys I wanted to teach you
05:29 - guys how to make nested if statements in
05:31 - the next couple tutorials we will be
05:34 - learning conditional operators and the
05:37 - use for this is that age has to be equal
05:40 - to 16 and if they are any older than 16
05:42 - then it won't work so if I say 21 they
05:45 - can legally drive but it says you cannot
05:47 - drive so the way to get around this is
05:49 - to use conditional operators so make
05:54 - some nested if statements get used to
05:56 - them and once you've got those nailed
05:58 - down go ahead and move on to the next
