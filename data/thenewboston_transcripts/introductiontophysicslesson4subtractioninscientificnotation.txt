00:00 - all right guys welcome to your fourth
00:02 - physics tutorial and in this tutorial
00:04 - I'm going to be talking about
00:05 - subtraction in scientific notation I'm
00:07 - going to be working with two positive
00:09 - exponents and then two negative
00:11 - exponents and then finally to wrap
00:13 - things up I'm going to be subtracting a
00:15 - negative exponent from a positive
00:17 - exponent now to be honest if you watch
00:19 - my last tutorial and you understand
00:21 - completely addition in sci scientific
00:24 - notation then this is going to be really
00:26 - easy for you however if you want to go
00:29 - through a couple more examples and see a
00:31 - few subtraction examples then stick
00:33 - around because you definitely need to
00:36 - understand this before we go on to the
00:37 - next storyals which is multiplication
00:39 - and division so the very first thing we
00:41 - need to do in this tutorial is we need
00:43 - to convert these scientific notation
00:45 - numbers to standard notation now 8.91 *
00:49 - 10 4 is
00:54 - 89,00 now 3.4 * 10 3 is 3,000
01:02 - 400 now
01:05 - 89100 minus
01:07 - 3,400 equals
01:11 - 85,000
01:13 - 700
01:15 - now what this converted into scientific
01:18 - notation is is right now the decimal
01:20 - point is right there and we want to move
01:22 - it right here so let's count the spaces
01:24 - 1 2 3 4 so our final answer equals =
01:34 - 8.57 time of course 10 to 4th so that's
01:38 - our final answer right
01:40 - there so now let's go ahead and move on
01:43 - to an example where we see a negative
01:46 - subtracted from a negative so the very
01:49 - first thing we need to do of course is
01:50 - convert this to standard notation in
01:53 - 6.26 * 10 -2 is
01:57 - point yeah I'm going to do that in like
01:59 - every tutorial I'm about to drop KCK my
02:01 - computer but
02:04 - 0
02:07 - 626 minus 5.9 * 10 -3 in standard
02:12 - notation is
02:15 - 0.00
02:17 - 59 so
02:20 - 0.626 minus
02:23 - 0.59
02:25 - equals
02:28 - 05 6 seven and of course what we need to
02:31 - do is we need to move this one two
02:34 - decimal points to the right so the final
02:36 - answer for this would be
02:41 - 5.67 * 10 to
02:45 - -2 so there's our final answer right
02:48 - there now to wrap things up let's go
02:51 - ahead and take a look at this right here
02:54 - now what we're doing is we basically
02:55 - have a really big number 1.45 * 10 6
03:00 - minus a really small number so 2.67 * 10
03:04 - to -2 so we're taking a really small
03:07 - amount away from a really big number so
03:09 - we're going to end up with a really big
03:10 - number we already know that so let's go
03:12 - ahead and walk well I guess I'll go
03:14 - ahead and walk you guys through this so
03:16 - 1.45 * 10 6 is
03:23 - 1,450,000 and that's it I'm make sure I
03:26 - got that right four zeros Yep looks
03:28 - pretty good - 2.67 * 10 -2
03:33 - is
03:36 - 0267 so 1 and a half million minus this
03:40 - really small number right here gives us
03:43 - 1 4 4 and let me see how
03:51 - many five
03:54 - NES 73 and our decimal point is right
03:57 - there so to be honest I don't even know
03:58 - how to read this number let me throw my
04:00 - commas in okay 1,
04:03 - 14499 199 and
04:07 - 973 as a your you know your fraction
04:09 - whatever the heck you want to call it so
04:11 - then we got to convert this whole dang
04:13 - thing in scientific notation so let's
04:15 - see how many decimal points we have to
04:16 - move it 1 2 3 4 five 6 so
04:26 - 1.44
04:28 - 9999 73 times 10 to the 6 right there so
04:35 - there is our whoa definitely messed that
04:37 - up let's see if I can get this there is
04:39 - our answer right there so 1.45 * 10 6
04:44 - minus 2.67 * 10 the -2 equals this
04:48 - massive number right there and that
04:49 - would probably be like your mom's weight
04:52 - in tons of course because she's huge
04:55 - burn and uh yeah so there you go there
04:57 - is subtraction again a lot like a
05:00 - however in the next tutor we're going to
05:02 - be covering multiplication and that's
05:04 - where things get tricky so I don't even
05:06 - know if you guys want to even watch that
05:08 - Toro because your brain might explode
05:10 - but if you are up for it then I'll see
05:12 - you there
