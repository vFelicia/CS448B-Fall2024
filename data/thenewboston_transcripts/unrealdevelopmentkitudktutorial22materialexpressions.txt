00:00 - what is going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - 22nd udk tutorial and it is now 11:44 at
00:07 - night and I just woke up so yeah time to
00:10 - start making some tutorials so in this
00:12 - tutorial what I'm going to be teaching
00:13 - you guys is how to make your own custom
00:15 - material and I'm going to be showing you
00:17 - guys exactly how to connect those
00:19 - expressions with your material right
00:21 - here in order to give you some nice cool
00:24 - effects so the very first thing I want
00:26 - to mention is this this big box in the
00:28 - middle of the screen that's where we're
00:29 - going to be working with the most this
00:31 - is basically your material now all these
00:34 - different attributes they're called the
00:36 - material channels but like I said
00:39 - sometimes I call them the material
00:40 - attributes because a material is much
00:42 - more than just a color or a picture
00:45 - there's a bunch of different things that
00:46 - make up your material and I'm just going
00:48 - to give you guys the quick tour of what
00:50 - all these things are the diffuse these
00:53 - two diffuse things are like the general
00:55 - overall color of your material the
00:58 - emissive is the glow the specular stuff
01:01 - is kind of like the shininess of it the
01:04 - opacity is like how opaque or
01:07 - transparent or how much you can see
01:08 - through your material the Distortion is
01:11 - kind of like how light bends around your
01:13 - material whenever you're working with
01:15 - like water or when something's really
01:18 - hot and you can see those waves we can
01:20 - uh use this property right here uh the
01:23 - transmission mask and the transmission
01:25 - color these have to do with how light
01:27 - passes through your surfaces and let's
01:30 - see the normal is actually one we're
01:32 - using quite a bit it's like the texture
01:34 - or the detail um the custom lighting
01:37 - allows you to make your own custom uh
01:40 - light function or light attribute I want
01:42 - to say and all of these down here these
01:45 - are really the ones that we really don't
01:47 - use that often so these are really
01:50 - specific and I'm going to be going over
01:51 - these later but these are your Basics
01:54 - ones and those are your core aspects of
01:56 - material so as you can see a material is
01:58 - made up of much more more than a color
02:01 - we get shininess glow all this cool
02:03 - stuff so now that with that being said
02:06 - these are your attributes so each
02:08 - attribute for example this color it
02:10 - needs information in order to tell our
02:13 - material what color it should be so like
02:16 - I said all of the information comes from
02:18 - something called an expression now in
02:21 - order to change the expression for the
02:23 - diffuse let's go ahead and find an
02:25 - expression I already know what one we
02:27 - need uh let's go ahead and search vector
02:30 - Vector parameter right here now go ahead
02:33 - and grab this and drag it out on the
02:35 - screen and now that you have this Vector
02:37 - parameter you can see a couple things
02:39 - first of all before I even get to this
02:40 - Vector parameter let me mention this
02:42 - I'll teach you guys how to navigate
02:44 - around this first of all in order to
02:47 - drag it's just like one of your
02:49 - orthographic graph views just go ahead
02:51 - and grab it and drag it
02:53 - around in order to drag one of these
02:55 - boxes say you want to move this
02:57 - expression closer to this material you
02:59 - can can't go ahead and drag it or else
03:01 - the whole thing is going to drag so what
03:02 - you need to do is hold control and drag
03:05 - it and that's probably a good position
03:07 - like right up there um in order to
03:09 - delete it go ahead and highlight it and
03:11 - once it's highlighted with yellow just
03:13 - go ahead and hit delete on your keyboard
03:15 - but we don't want to delete that for now
03:16 - so we're just going to go ahead and drag
03:18 - it out and let me go ahead and control
03:20 - and drag that a little bit closer so now
03:23 - what I want to talk to you guys about is
03:26 - this expression right here first of all
03:28 - each of these pressions have their own
03:31 - custom way of doing things so I already
03:33 - know that in order to change the color
03:35 - for material we're going to use the
03:37 - vector parameter and I'm going to be
03:39 - going over all these uh later on but for
03:42 - now I'm just going to show you guys a
03:43 - simple example of how you can connect an
03:45 - expression to one of the attributes so a
03:48 - vector is think of it as like a list of
03:52 - numbers so that's where we're going to
03:53 - use this expression because if you ever
03:55 - worked with color on your computer
03:57 - before you know that color is made made
03:59 - up of more than one value it's made up
04:01 - of
04:02 - RGB and so you need three values so
04:05 - that's why we need this list right here
04:07 - make sense so we can't just give it the
04:09 - number like seven because what the heck
04:11 - color is seven you need like RGB value
04:14 - of like you know three values basically
04:17 - so now I want to talk to you guys about
04:19 - these tabs as you can see we have tabs
04:22 - on the right side of this box and tabs
04:25 - on the left side of this box so any tabs
04:28 - that are on the left hand side are
04:31 - outputs this is where information is
04:33 - coming out from anytime it's on the
04:36 - right hand side it's an input so
04:38 - information always flow flows from right
04:40 - to left for example it might be easier
04:42 - to see if I drag this ad method out here
04:45 - the ad method or the add function it's
04:47 - typically called an expression but I
04:49 - column function sometimes takes two
04:51 - numbers AKA input from A and B and it
04:54 - outputs one number simple enough pretty
04:57 - cool huh so that might be a little more
04:59 - clear to see but we don't want that in
05:00 - this tutorial so go ahead and delete
05:02 - that what this parameter function does
05:05 - is it just outputs numbers so if you go
05:07 - ahead and highlight it you can go ahead
05:09 - and change the values RGB so every color
05:13 - is made up of
05:14 - RGB value
05:16 - however in the udk it doesn't use the
05:20 - default 0 to 255 it uses a value of 0 to
05:24 - one I know it's a little weird but
05:26 - that's how it works so go ahead and give
05:28 - your RG and B any value from zero to one
05:32 - like
05:33 - 75 uh
05:35 - .5 and we'll leave this one at like 6
05:40 - let's see how that looks so we get this
05:43 - nice pale looking and I'm actually just
05:45 - going to go ahead and change this to
05:47 - zero and oh that looks pretty good nice
05:50 - hot pink so like I said we can work with
05:54 - any value from zero to one what we can
05:58 - also do is give a number greater than
06:01 - one so if we take this red and well let
06:03 - me go ahead and show you guys how to
06:04 - connect this first in order to connect
06:07 - this go ahead and take your black output
06:09 - and drag it over to the diffuse now what
06:12 - the black output means is this the black
06:16 - output in this case transmits the RGB
06:19 - all at once this red green and blue
06:22 - transmits the red green and blue data
06:24 - and this white one transmits the
06:26 - transparency that so that's why we're
06:28 - using the black output because we want
06:30 - to give it the entire list of rgbl at
06:33 - once and again I'm not going to be going
06:34 - over these parameters I just want to
06:36 - give you guys a basic idea of how this
06:38 - how these things are connected in this
06:39 - tutorial so don't worry if you don't
06:41 - quite understand that yet but basically
06:43 - like I was saying before these RGB
06:46 - values by default you should always
06:49 - input something from zero to one but you
06:52 - have the ability of adding a number
06:54 - greater than one now whenever you add a
06:56 - number greater than one it's pretty much
06:58 - going to boost that color so let's go
07:00 - ahead and pump this way up and add like
07:02 - the number 25 what this is going to do
07:05 - is Boost this color so it shines even
07:07 - outside the material so let me go ahead
07:09 - and itch my
07:10 - ear there we go my ear was itching a
07:13 - little bit had to take care of that so
07:15 - as you can see whenever we boost the
07:17 - color it gives us this kind of well as
07:20 - you can see I don't know how to explain
07:22 - it other than just looking at it it
07:24 - pretty much pumps color into this object
07:26 - or material so it's kind of like glowing
07:29 - with that color so 0o to one is default
07:32 - values but we can pump extra color into
07:33 - it to give it kind of a glowing effect
07:36 - so that's the basics of how you can
07:39 - alter different attributes with your
07:41 - material by giving them values via an
07:45 - expression so pretty much all of these
07:47 - attributes need some value in order to
07:49 - work and the values come from these
07:52 - Expressions now these Expressions you
07:54 - can just go ahead and click on them and
07:56 - give them values or sometimes with like
07:59 - uh uh the add expression you get two
08:02 - separate inputs and it calculates an
08:04 - output but we'll be talking about that
08:06 - later on for this tutorial like I said I
08:08 - just wanted to explain you guys the
08:10 - basics of what these are and how you can
08:13 - connect an expression to these
08:16 - attributes so with that being said let
08:18 - me mention this before I let you guys go
08:20 - in order to save your material go ahead
08:23 - and make this checkbox right here and
08:25 - this says apply changes to the original
08:28 - material and before I even want to
08:30 - mention that in order to disconnect your
08:34 - expression from your material go ahead
08:36 - and ALT click one of these check boxes
08:38 - and whenever you alt click it the arrow
08:40 - is going to disappear so that's how you
08:43 - disconnect it in case you guys wanted to
08:44 - know in order to connect it again just
08:46 - go ahead and drag and connect it so now
08:49 - that I want to save my changes I'm going
08:51 - to go ahead and click this check boox
08:53 - right here and it's going to save my
08:55 - changes now I can X out of this and make
08:57 - sure that you save your package by
08:59 - having right click and save and now just
09:02 - like before we have our new pink
09:04 - material right here so what we can do is
09:07 - go ahead and drag and drop that on an
09:09 - object and check it out our new custom
09:12 - material is applied to this object
09:15 - pretty awesome huh so that's the basics
09:17 - of how you can connect expressions with
09:19 - materials again in this tutorial I want
09:21 - to teach you guys is how to make the
09:23 - connections in the next tutorial I'm
09:24 - going to be talking to you guys about
09:26 - all the different kinds of material we
09:28 - can make and all the different ways the
09:30 - Expressions work so thank you guys for
09:32 - watching don't forget to subscribe and
09:33 - I'll see you guys in the next video
