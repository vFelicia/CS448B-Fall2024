00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:02 - and this is a video tutorial for the new
00:04 - Boston now in this video tutorial series
00:07 - we're going to be looking at Ajax now
00:09 - Ajax isn't specifically relative to PHP
00:12 - however many PHP applications or
00:16 - websites you may create with PHP can be
00:19 - massively enhanced with Ajax because
00:21 - what we can do is we can create
00:22 - applications that allow us to say click
00:25 - a button or type add some kind of data
00:27 - in and we can grab data from a database
00:30 - or a text file or just simply include a
00:35 - pet include a PHP file onto our page
00:39 - that gives us dynamic information so
00:42 - updated information and Ajax has been
00:45 - used for a long time now and recently
00:48 - started to be create more popular we're
00:51 - in 2011 when this video is being
00:53 - recorded so it's extremely popular on
00:55 - the web so why is Ajax special what
00:59 - makes it special I'm just going to talk
01:01 - to you a bit about the features of Ajax
01:03 - that create that create a more dynamic
01:05 - web experience if you like now Ajax
01:08 - first of all stands for a sync RIA a
01:10 - synchronous JavaScript and XML and what
01:13 - this means is that we can process data
01:16 - through well behind the scenes of our
01:19 - website just using a JavaScript and
01:23 - XHTML as well or HTML so it
01:28 - synchronously sends a value and retrieve
01:31 - something without having to reload the
01:34 - entire page so if you think about a web
01:37 - page in general you have let's say we're
01:39 - on index dot PHP at the moment you have
01:42 - some data on a page and you click a form
01:44 - for example to maybe submit a
01:46 - registration or you might just click a
01:48 - button to retrieve a list of values that
01:51 - you've typed in a search box for example
01:53 - so you may have a search box on your web
01:55 - page and this may return a value now
01:58 - usually you would use a form submit so
02:02 - you would say let's just break out our
02:04 - PHP tags we would say form action equals
02:07 - something
02:09 - method equals something come down here
02:12 - we would enter we would create a submit
02:15 - button and what would happen is when we
02:19 - press this submit button we're taken to
02:22 - the forum action then what we can do is
02:24 - we can specify buttons just on their own
02:27 - and what these do is they will send a
02:31 - they will call a function inside of our
02:35 - header so if we were to set up a
02:37 - standard page like this sorry start the
02:42 - head tag and then end the head tag start
02:45 - the body and the body so very badly
02:50 - written out an HTML document here we've
02:53 - got head we can include some JavaScript
02:57 - so you can say script type equals text
02:58 - forward slash JavaScript and then end
03:02 - that there so this is a general setup
03:05 - for a website with one input button here
03:07 - what we can do is we could say unclick
03:09 - equals and then we call a function
03:12 - within JavaScript so we could say update
03:15 - page for example now up here we may have
03:20 - a function in JavaScript called update
03:21 - page which is going to call and work
03:24 - with Ajax we're not going to give any
03:26 - examples in this introduction video but
03:28 - it would call this function and it would
03:31 - process some kind of Ajax code if you
03:36 - like or the methodology or the methods
03:38 - used with Ajax to actually update a
03:41 - certain area on the page so for example
03:44 - below here we can have a div ID equals
03:51 - page for example okay so this might grab
03:55 - an a PHP document and it might update
03:58 - this div with the contents of the PHP
04:01 - document so this is obviously a very
04:03 - basic example we're just updating
04:05 - perhaps some data from a PHP file and
04:08 - popping it onto a page but using this
04:10 - method we won't actually refresh the
04:13 - page now I've just given you sort of
04:15 - like an example of how it may work this
04:17 - this code obviously is not might not be
04:20 - how we actually do it but erm is
04:23 - very similar and this is just the
04:24 - general method that we will use in order
04:27 - to update values without having to
04:28 - refresh a page so why can this be useful
04:31 - in everyday applications well for
04:33 - example when we go to over to Google
04:38 - you'll notice that we have a feature in
04:40 - Google called autosuggest
04:42 - and what happens is is when we I'll just
04:44 - briefly explain when we when we look at
04:47 - Google we type in a value into a text
04:51 - box which is placed in the center of the
04:53 - screen so we start typing let's say PHP
04:57 - now what what Ajax and for the other
05:01 - part that Ajax plays in this is what
05:03 - I'll do it will automatically get the
05:06 - updated value of this text box so let's
05:09 - say we just start typing we'll create an
05:12 - input type so we can search box sorry
05:20 - the type equals text and name equals
05:24 - search box okay so what's going to
05:28 - happen is is we're going to start typing
05:30 - something for example into here so we
05:32 - might start typing PHP now as we type P
05:35 - it's going to get the value of this text
05:38 - box which is equal to P at the moment
05:39 - and it's going to search a database for
05:41 - the most popular searches relating or
05:46 - that start with P then we're going to
05:48 - save pH so it's going to foot and then
05:50 - it's going to then re update itself
05:52 - without obviously having to refresh the
05:53 - page because if you were to refresh the
05:55 - page every time you type something you'd
05:57 - have absolute pandemonium pandemonium
06:00 - pandemonium and it would not work so
06:03 - we've got pH and then we type P and it's
06:05 - going to find the most search for
06:07 - results with PHP so that's just
06:10 - generally oh that's just generally how
06:12 - it works so um this uses Ajax Google or
06:17 - Google Suggest uses Ajax and a variety
06:20 - of other websites too as well Facebook
06:21 - uses Ajax and this is a this uses it in
06:24 - a really interesting way when you're
06:26 - looking at a Facebook say news feed
06:28 - you'll be looking at the news feed
06:30 - straight up and down and you'll have
06:32 - your Mouse still now you look at your
06:35 - you'll look at your page
06:36 - thing will update then what you'll do is
06:38 - you'll move your mouse very slightly it
06:40 - only has to literally be one pixel that
06:42 - you move your mouse and your page will
06:44 - actually update now what happens here is
06:47 - we have an unmask move or on Mouse event
06:50 - trigger so when you move your mouse bits
06:54 - of the page updated using Ajax so it
06:57 - will be automatically updated from the
06:59 - database using Ajax
07:01 - the same with Twitter as well when you
07:03 - create a new tweet you might tweet in a
07:05 - box like this and click Submit or hit
07:07 - enter and it will automatically show
07:09 - your most recent tweet it won't actually
07:11 - refresh the page the same with probably
07:14 - the feeds in Twitter you'll
07:16 - automatically see new feed open so this
07:20 - is why we use Ajax and why it's so
07:22 - important on the web today when we don't
07:24 - want boring static web sites we want
07:26 - everything to be easy to use and dynamic
07:28 - and that's another reason we use ajax is
07:30 - because it's really easy to use a
07:33 - website that's been M enhanced with Ajax
07:35 - particularly with PHP where we're
07:37 - gaining values from a database we can do
07:40 - other things with Ajax but for now we're
07:42 - going to be looking at ajax closely
07:44 - related to PHP because Ajax is so
07:46 - closely related to PHP where we grab
07:48 - things from the database obviously it
07:50 - can be used with other web programming
07:52 - languages but obviously because this is
07:54 - PHP tutorials we're going to be looking
07:56 - at Ajax and PHP so that's a bit about
07:59 - Ajax how it works what it is why we
08:01 - should use it now in the next in the
08:04 - next tutorials coming coming up we're
08:06 - going to be looking at how to first of
08:09 - all the basics of that and I'm going to
08:10 - be creating some sample programs to grab
08:12 - some data from databases depending on
08:15 - what we do on the page
