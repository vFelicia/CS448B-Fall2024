00:00 - what's up guys it's Bucky and welcome to
00:01 - another Back aming tutorial in this
00:04 - tutorial what I'm going to be doing is
00:05 - teaching you guys another technique and
00:08 - this technique is called hitting them to
00:10 - kind of slow down their momentum I know
00:13 - it's kind of a long name but just deal
00:15 - with me so anyways what we have set up
00:17 - here is white already made their first
00:19 - move so what they did is they moved
00:22 - their 17 points your 16 point and they
00:24 - also took it off their 24 point on your
00:27 - five point so what we need to do now is
00:30 - play our role so we being Brown rolled a
00:33 - two and a one now a noob might do
00:37 - something stupid like this he might play
00:38 - his 2 to 22 and your 1 to 23 to get his
00:42 - 24 check Checkers off there but what a
00:45 - better play is is this for your two
00:48 - you're going to want to go ahead and
00:49 - play your 13 to your 11 into to your one
00:51 - you're going to want to take a checker
00:53 - off your six and hit them on the five
00:55 - right there and this is going to send
00:57 - their checker on the bar you're saying
00:58 - all right Bucky why would it be better
01:01 - for me to move these two chips and leave
01:03 - them susceptible instead of advancing my
01:06 - last two 24 Checkers just like that well
01:09 - there are a couple reasons why you'd
01:11 - want to hit them in this case than just
01:13 - going ahead and advancing your last two
01:15 - Checkers the first reason is this what
01:19 - white is trying to do is they're trying
01:21 - to build a point on your fivepoint now
01:23 - this is a critical point not only when
01:25 - you're trying to Bear off but when
01:27 - you're trying to just Advance your
01:28 - Checkers and land on your five point so
01:31 - you don't want to give up this point
01:32 - without fight so that's why it's useful
01:34 - to hit him now aside from that what you
01:37 - need to do is and this is the whole
01:39 - point of this tutorial is you hit them
01:42 - whenever you want to slow down their
01:43 - momentum and what that means is this
01:45 - whenever white makes his next role check
01:48 - this out he got a one and a two instead
01:51 - of just moving some of these checkers
01:53 - one then two or this one three spaces or
01:56 - whatever even though he can't even do
01:58 - that he needs to spend an entire dice
02:01 - just getting off the bar so instead of
02:03 - having two rolls or excuse me two moves
02:06 - to make he can only make one move that's
02:09 - actually beneficial to him and the other
02:11 - move he just spends getting off the bar
02:13 - so anytime you can make your opponent
02:15 - spend time getting off the bar instead
02:17 - of doing something useful that's
02:19 - beneficial to you and the last point I
02:21 - want to make is while you're saying all
02:24 - right Bucky but if he's on the bar and
02:27 - you left his blot open to get hit then
02:29 - isn't that susceptible for him to hit
02:31 - you if your rolls a five and you end up
02:33 - on the bar well this is something that
02:35 - you typically don't need to worry about
02:37 - early on the game first of all like I
02:39 - said you want to fight for these points
02:41 - and fighting for crucial points is more
02:44 - important than worrying about getting
02:46 - hit early in the game and I'll tell you
02:47 - why because early in the game right now
02:50 - remember when you enter you enter in his
02:52 - home board look at it right now look how
02:55 - open it is pretty much unless you roll
02:58 - double sixes you're going to be able to
03:00 - play this Checker it's going to be
03:01 - really easy in the opening turns to get
03:05 - your Checker off so the easier it is to
03:08 - get this Checker off the less you have
03:10 - to worry about getting hit and right now
03:13 - any roll 1 through five you're going to
03:15 - be able to move this baby off right
03:17 - there so that is why in this case
03:19 - hitting would be better than just
03:21 - advancing two normal Checkers from
03:23 - behind
