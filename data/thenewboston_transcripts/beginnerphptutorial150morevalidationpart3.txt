00:00 - so we've got 30 for the username for the
00:05 - first name for the password I'll give it
00:07 - one
00:13 - anyway and perhaps you could specify a
00:15 - minimum length as well um well no we
00:18 - can't actually do this but but I mean in
00:20 - in PHP we could give it a a a minimum
00:23 - length that it needs to be for security
00:25 - reasons um in fact I'll leave this out
00:27 - for now because uh I don't want to be
00:29 - writing too much code and waste too much
00:31 - time so uh max length Okay so we'll put
00:35 - a max length in here for the um first
00:39 - name and that's going to be 40 remember
00:42 - 40 and the same here for the surname max
00:46 - length equals 40 so let's save that and
00:50 - go back to our page and we'll just see
00:51 - how that's changed our form
00:54 - itself back and register okay so first
00:58 - name let's type in a load of rubbish and
01:00 - we can see when it stops okay you can
01:02 - see that that I'm still typing you can
01:04 - probably hear my keyboard but you can
01:06 - see it's not typing anything so that's
01:09 - okay let's do the same with
01:11 - surname okay you can probably hear that
01:13 - I'm still typing however
01:16 - um the uh input's not working and then
01:20 - the same with
01:22 - username okay you can see that stopped
01:24 - as well so that's fair enough but now we
01:26 - need to ensure that it's checked by our
01:28 - PHP script as well well now I'm not
01:31 - going to be able to test I'm not going
01:32 - to be testing this um by sort of
01:35 - downloading this file modifying it
01:36 - because I've already got access to it so
01:38 - when we test it in PHP I'm just going to
01:39 - remove the max length so we've got max
01:42 - length of 30 for the username 40 for the
01:44 - first name and surname so let's come up
01:47 - and find out where are we going to put
01:48 - this check what's the best place uh that
01:51 - we could possibly put this check well
01:53 - we're checking here if the username and
01:56 - everything else is not empty so a good
01:59 - place to do it would be to do it
02:01 - underneath this because we want to check
02:04 - the max length after we've checked that
02:06 - it's not empty so let's um we'll indent
02:10 - in and then we'll um we'll uh indent the
02:13 - rest of our code in in a minute so we're
02:15 - going to create an if statement with a
02:17 - condition here and then start a block
02:19 - the block ends
02:21 - after this so it'll be down let's just
02:23 - double check where it would
02:28 - be so if we come over to this one
02:31 - here it's going to be if and then if
02:36 - else it would be
02:38 - here um so let's indent the rest of
02:45 - this it might be there anyway we might
02:47 - return an error but it's hard to hard to
02:49 - see when you're doing things like this
02:50 - so what we want to say is if um St Len
02:56 - of username is greater than 30
03:01 - um and remember this is the condition
03:03 - and then we say else the rest of the
03:05 - code so if the string L string length of
03:08 - username is greater than 30 or the
03:11 - string length of uh first name is
03:15 - greater than
03:16 - 40 or the string
03:20 - length of surname is greater than
03:26 - 40 um we need to Echo please adhere to
03:33 - max length of fields now the reason
03:37 - we're not giving a user friendly message
03:38 - here is the only reason this would ever
03:41 - um this error would would ever be
03:43 - returned if someone had modified the
03:44 - form themselves max length is a standard
03:47 - property for input types so therefore
03:50 - all browsers will pick up this max
03:52 - length and they'll always allow you only
03:54 - a max length so we're only doing this if
03:57 - people are going to mess around with our
03:58 - form so let's change the max length up
04:01 - to 100 uh for each of them so we can
04:03 - test this and then we'll change them
04:06 - back in just a moment oh I save that uh
04:10 - save okay so let's uh refresh the
04:14 - page okay so let's enter a load of
04:16 - rubbish into
04:18 - there okay uh let's enter a password
04:21 - sensibly because we need this to
04:23 - match um and a load of rubbish into
04:27 - here and a load of rubbish into here
04:30 - let's click
04:31 - register and it says please adhere to
04:33 - max length of fields okay so now let's
04:35 - sensibly register a
04:43 - user okay so let's click register and it
04:46 - says you've registered let's go over to
04:48 - our database to check that that
04:49 - everything's worked and you can see that
04:52 - that's worked so let's go back before we
04:54 - do anything else or well this is the end
04:56 - of the tutorial but let's change these
04:59 - back make sure you have your max length
05:01 - in here so what we've done is we've
05:03 - corrected a few undefined variable and
05:05 - undefined index errors and we've also
05:07 - changed the part of the form
05:09 - validation which might not immediately
05:12 - be um you know a priority for some
05:15 - people people might not think about it
05:17 - straight away but you are in fact going
05:19 - to cut data off if you submit or allow
05:21 - your users to submit too much data so
05:24 - for example if it was a description
05:26 - about themselves you might want to limit
05:27 - them to 200 300 you know 500 characters
05:31 - um but then you need to take into
05:32 - account that you need to limit them
05:33 - otherwise your data is going to be cut
05:35 - off when you submit it in um in
05:39 - uh in MySQL there are some exceptions
05:42 - you can give it the text data type which
05:44 - will allow you I can't remember how many
05:46 - characters but quite a few characters
05:48 - but always always always give a max
05:50 - length in your field and also do the
05:52 - relevant checks inside your PHP code as
05:55 - well
