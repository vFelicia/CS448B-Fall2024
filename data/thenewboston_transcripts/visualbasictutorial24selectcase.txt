00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to be taking a
00:08 - look at the select case statement now
00:11 - the select case statement is very
00:13 - similar to the if statement but
00:16 - sometimes you need to use a select case
00:18 - instead of if because it's a lot more
00:20 - efficient and I'll explain this to you
00:23 - as we start programming so let's go
00:25 - ahead and get started we're going to
00:26 - create a
00:28 - variable and we'll call it my int and
00:31 - we're just going to make it an
00:33 - integer it's now what we're going to do
00:36 - is we're going to get the integer from
00:39 - the user so let's just ask them for an
00:45 - integer please enter an
00:50 - integer now I'm just going to get what
00:52 - they type
00:56 - in and now what we're going to do is
00:58 - we're going to create our select select
01:01 - case statement so we're going to start
01:03 - off by typing select and it says runs
01:06 - one of several groups of statements
01:07 - depending on the value of an expression
01:10 - so after select we're going to type case
01:14 - and it says the same thing and now what
01:17 - we're going to do is we're going to type
01:18 - in our variable that we're going to use
01:20 - for the select case statement so in our
01:23 - case we're going to use my int and you
01:25 - can see when you press enter it
01:27 - automatically adds in select for you
01:30 - so what a select case statement does is
01:33 - that it starts off by checking the first
01:36 - case so let's just do case
01:38 - zero console. right
01:43 - line
01:46 - hello and we'll do case one and you can
01:49 - see there that whenever you create a
01:53 - case you're going to start by using the
01:56 - keyword case and you're going to add
01:59 - whichever whatever you want it to be so
02:01 - in our case we're using an integer so if
02:02 - the integer is equal to zero then go
02:04 - ahead and do this and you can do this
02:06 - with a string so if a string is equal to
02:09 - uh this right here then go ahead and do
02:12 - whatever is in here now as I was saying
02:15 - uh I kind of interrupted myself there
02:17 - but with a select case statement the
02:18 - reason it's more efficient than an if
02:20 - statement is that it'll go through and
02:24 - let's start the select case statement
02:26 - and if case Zero is true then it's going
02:29 - to go ahead and in the select case
02:31 - statement for you it's not even going to
02:32 - take a look at any other cases you have
02:34 - so you could have hundreds and hundreds
02:36 - of cases but as soon as it reaches the
02:38 - the one case it's looking for it'll exit
02:41 - your select case statement now if you
02:43 - use if and else if then is going to even
02:47 - though it won't execute the code it's
02:48 - going to look at all of your else ifs
02:50 - and that's one of the reasons you would
02:52 - want to use select case over if else if
02:56 - so we'll just do case one we'll add a
02:58 - couple more cases
03:21 - here okay so now that we have three
03:23 - cases we're going to go ahead and run
03:25 - our program now let's not forget to do
03:28 - console. readline so it wa for us to
03:30 - input something before the program
03:33 - closes and if we run
03:36 - this it'll say please enter an integer
03:39 - so if we type zero it's going to say
03:43 - hello and we'll run this a couple more
03:45 - times and go through each case if we
03:47 - type one it'll say
03:50 - buy and then if we type two it'll say
03:55 - good
03:56 - morning so a select case statement is
04:00 - fairly simple it's quite similar to the
04:02 - if else if and um once you have that
04:06 - down go ahead and move on to the next
04:07 - tutorial and we're going to be learning
04:09 - more about select case and thanks for
04:13 - watching
