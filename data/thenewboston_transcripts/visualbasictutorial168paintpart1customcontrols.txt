00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live camera for the New Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're gonna start
00:08 - working on a paint program similar to
00:11 - paint that comes on Windows where you
00:14 - can draw and start painting stuff out on
00:17 - the screen now this project is directly
00:21 - taken from a book called beginning
00:23 - Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 by Thea Ron
00:27 - I think that's right Willis and Brian
00:30 - Newsome I just wanted to give them
00:32 - credit for this because it's a very good
00:36 - program to learn from and it's very
00:40 - object oriented so you can create this
00:43 - whole program without even adding a
00:44 - single line of code to your form one
00:47 - class it's all done by using custom user
00:50 - controls and other classes so just keep
00:55 - in mind that I didn't make this project
00:56 - myself but I'm gonna be explaining it to
00:58 - you guys and teaching you guys how to do
01:00 - it so we'll create a new project will
01:04 - select a windows forms application and
01:07 - we'll just call it paint and also
01:09 - combine paint YouTube
01:10 - cuz I'm pretty sure I've got another
01:12 - copy of a paint program similar so go
01:16 - ahead and click OK and wait for that to
01:17 - load so here's our form 1 and what we
01:23 - want to do is we'll right-click on paint
01:25 - YouTube and let's add a user control now
01:30 - what our user control is is it's pretty
01:32 - much a way for you to build your own
01:35 - user control so you can take a part of a
01:39 - window and you can add buttons and
01:42 - anything you'd like to it and it's
01:45 - pre-made for you so you can add that to
01:48 - your different forms so let's say you
01:50 - want to have something that's used a lot
01:53 - throughout your program and you don't
01:54 - have to copy and paste those buttons and
01:56 - rename them every time you can create a
01:58 - custom user control and add the stuff
02:00 - you need and then just put that control
02:01 - into it so the name for this one is
02:04 - going to be paint canvas so this is
02:08 - gonna be our paint canvas control that
02:09 - we're going to be painting to
02:12 - so let's go ahead and come over here and
02:15 - let's set the back color to white
02:17 - because when you're painting you want to
02:21 - be painting on something white so now
02:24 - all we need to do is we need to add this
02:25 - control to our form 1 dot V B now in
02:29 - order for us to do that first we're
02:31 - gonna have to come over here to paint
02:32 - YouTube right click and build it so now
02:37 - that it's built let's come over here to
02:39 - form 1 dot V B so now we can use our
02:42 - paint canvas control we'll come over
02:44 - here to our tool box and it will
02:47 - minimize how two common controls and you
02:50 - can see here that we got paint you tube
02:51 - components and we've created this paint
02:54 - canvas item right here so we can go
02:56 - ahead and drag this on to our form 1 and
02:59 - you can see that's a little big and it
03:01 - doesn't fit inside so what we can do is
03:03 - we can change the dock of this so we'll
03:06 - come over here to dock and it will click
03:08 - the middle button to fill the whole form
03:10 - so now our whole form will be filled
03:13 - with the paint canvas and we can resize
03:16 - the form all we want and the paint
03:18 - canvas canvas will still cover the whole
03:20 - thing so it will set the text form 1 to
03:25 - paint VB so that I'll just make it look
03:27 - a little bit better ok so now that we've
03:32 - created our custom paint canvas control
03:34 - and our and we've added it to our form 1
03:38 - let's come over here to paint YouTube
03:39 - and let's add another class so let me
03:44 - shrink this down some here we'll select
03:46 - a class and we'll just call it graphics
03:50 - item so we'll wait for graphics item to
03:55 - load and let's go ahead and zoom in ok
04:00 - so we want to make this class must
04:03 - inherit so we'll use the public key word
04:05 - I only use public and then the keyword
04:07 - must inherit so that means that
04:11 - basically when a developer wants to use
04:13 - this graphics item class they cannot
04:16 - directly make an object of graphics
04:18 - item it forces them to use a different
04:21 - class that inherits from graphics item
04:23 - so let's say we've got graphics circled
04:26 - like what we're going to use later on
04:27 - graphics Urkel inherits from graphics
04:30 - item so we can create a graphic circle
04:32 - object but not a graphics item object
04:34 - because it cannot be used unless it is
04:37 - inherited by another class so now we
04:40 - need to add some variables that we can
04:43 - use in our graphics items class so we'll
04:46 - just do color so we'll just type public
04:49 - color as and we'll just do it of type
04:54 - color and it's an a RGB color which is
04:58 - alpha red green and blue and Visual
05:00 - Basic has a whole bunch of colors built
05:01 - into it that you can use now we'll just
05:04 - do public is filled as bulan and then
05:10 - we'll create one more so public
05:13 - rectangle as rectangle so is filled is
05:18 - basically basically gonna let us know
05:21 - later on if the circle is going to be
05:25 - filled because we're going to be drawing
05:26 - on our form or our paint canvas with a
05:31 - whole bunch of circles so we want to
05:33 - know if those circles are filled or if
05:35 - they aren't but we can easily change is
05:37 - filled equal to true or false
05:38 - to fill in circles or not later on and
05:41 - public rectangle is just going to be of
05:44 - type rectangle which has a width and a
05:49 - height now whenever you draw circles you
05:52 - have to have a rectangle object so
05:55 - basically what it does is it takes that
05:57 - rectangle and then it draws a circle
06:00 - inside of that rectangle so where all
06:01 - the edges of the circle are touching the
06:04 - sides of the square now or rectangle now
06:08 - this might be a little confusing but you
06:11 - know start to understand it later on so
06:14 - let's go ahead and comment this so let's
06:17 - just do public variables okay so now
06:21 - that we've started creating the graphics
06:22 - item class I know I have crammed a lot
06:26 - into this tutorial custom user controls
06:28 - we've started creating our graphics item
06:31 - class with the
06:32 - Sen Harry keyword so you may don't watch
06:35 - this over again if you're not quite
06:36 - grasping everything but if you do and
06:39 - you're familiar with custom controls or
06:41 - must inherit or if you just understand
06:43 - it right off the bat then go ahead and
06:44 - move on to the next tutorial I'm going
06:46 - to continue working on this program
