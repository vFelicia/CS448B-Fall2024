00:00 - what up y'all just want to make a quick
00:02 - video to show you what I've been working
00:04 - on and I know I already made a tutorial
00:06 - series about this but things have
00:09 - evolved since that plant watering idea
00:11 - so starting again from the top this is
00:16 - tnb OS yes of course it's not an actual
00:19 - operating system it's actually a desktop
00:21 - client built with electron in react and
00:24 - it allows your computer to communicate
00:26 - with any other computer running tmbos
00:28 - and that's it what you build from there
00:31 - is really up to you
00:32 - now so far we got five apps Built Well
00:36 - seven if you include these system apps
00:38 - but five user-facing apps I would say
00:41 - and we'll take a look at these in just a
00:43 - bit but first let's go ahead and do a
00:46 - quick review of the network architecture
00:50 - so at the heart of everything is going
00:52 - to be our core server and the purpose of
00:55 - the server is really just to allow our
00:57 - client devices to connect to kind of
01:00 - like this so that they can communicate
01:02 - with one another so basically acting as
01:05 - a router between devices
01:07 - now I already made a tutorial on how to
01:09 - set this up configure everything and
01:12 - I'll leave a link to that video in the
01:13 - description below and I also wrote up a
01:16 - Google doc guide if anyone would prefer
01:18 - that but either way once you have your
01:20 - core server up and running let's go
01:22 - ahead and connect to it using tnb OS so
01:25 - first things first how do we get tnb OS
01:28 - well if you go to this URL which is also
01:32 - going to be in the description below but
01:34 - if you go to github.com the New Boston
01:37 - bostonhyphen developer slash tnbos then
01:40 - it's going to take you here
01:42 - and to again you probably want to clone
01:45 - it and then to set it up it's a piece of
01:48 - cake pretty much like any other
01:49 - JavaScript project just run npm install
01:52 - npm start and then this thing right here
01:55 - is going to pop open you're actually
01:57 - going to have a welcome model that pops
01:59 - up you can just go ahead and dismiss
02:01 - that I'll talk you through everything in
02:02 - this video
02:04 - but what we're trying to do first is
02:06 - just connect to that core server that we
02:08 - have set up so how do we do that
02:10 - excellent question if you go ahead and
02:12 - click this icon on the bottom right this
02:14 - network icon this is going to pop open
02:16 - your network manager and from here we're
02:20 - going to click add a network basically
02:22 - like adding a core server and then we
02:25 - just put in the info for that core
02:27 - server the network ID this is just going
02:29 - to be the domain name so mine is on the
02:32 - new boston.network
02:34 - protocol https now for the port we don't
02:37 - need to fill out anything that's just
02:39 - going to default to 443 based on this
02:41 - protocol in the display name you can
02:44 - just create a shorthand version of
02:46 - usually I like to you know make it
02:48 - similar to the network ID but you know
02:50 - more readable version of that
02:53 - and for the logo URL pretty much just uh
02:57 - have any image that represents your
03:00 - network hit submit and there you go and
03:03 - you can tell by the green little
03:04 - indicator right here that we are indeed
03:06 - connected
03:08 - so just to kind of keep this diagram
03:10 - updated what we pretty much did right
03:13 - here is the equivalent of this
03:15 - connection just like that
03:17 - now
03:18 - whenever you first booted up tnb OS it
03:20 - generated an account for you and that
03:23 - includes an account number that you can
03:24 - see by clicking on this little QR icon
03:27 - on the bottom right now you can go ahead
03:30 - and copy that because we're going to
03:31 - need it in just a bit however one other
03:34 - thing I want to mention real quick is
03:36 - that in addition to that e each core
03:39 - that we connect to it's also going to
03:41 - maintain what's called a credit balance
03:43 - for your account now this represents the
03:46 - number of messages that this device can
03:48 - send using that core so on that note
03:51 - before we can start sending data to
03:53 - other devices we're going to need to go
03:55 - in Django admin and credit this account
03:57 - so again make sure that you have this
03:59 - account number copied and pop open
04:02 - Django admin and just go to accounts
04:05 - actually let me move this so you can see
04:08 - actually let me do this I'm going to go
04:10 - ahead and hit add account and then paste
04:13 - in that account number
04:15 - I'll do ten thousand now before I hit
04:18 - save and continue what I want to do is
04:20 - this keep an eye on this balance right
04:22 - here because I'm about to hit save and
04:24 - continue and you see whenever I do that
04:27 - your balance is going to update in real
04:28 - time
04:30 - pretty sweet huh
04:32 - all right
04:34 - so now that we have some credits let's
04:36 - go ahead and connect to my MacBook so
04:38 - just uh I don't know if I mentioned this
04:40 - but right now I'm on my iMac in sitting
04:44 - right to the right of me is my MacBook
04:46 - and throughout this video I'll just be
04:48 - using these two devices to kind of
04:50 - communicate back and forth and show you
04:52 - all the features of a tnb OS so on that
04:55 - note let's go ahead and open this app
04:57 - which is the account manager and I'm
04:59 - going to add my MacBooks account I
05:02 - already have the account number copied
05:04 - display name
05:06 - I'll just write MacBook
05:08 - and I already have the Avatar URL for
05:10 - this as well
05:12 - so boom look at that easy easy nice and
05:15 - cheesy we are now connected to my
05:18 - MacBook where's that diagram let me keep
05:20 - this updated
05:22 - so now we got this architecture going
05:24 - looking good and believe it or not we're
05:27 - all set up ready to start using apps
05:29 - however before we do there is one last
05:32 - important concept that we need to cover
05:34 - and that's the ability to connect to
05:36 - other devices through multiple cores
05:39 - so what am I talking about well although
05:42 - it isn't 100 necessary
05:45 - whenever you connect to devices through
05:48 - multiple cores it does improve fault
05:50 - tolerance so what am I talking about
05:53 - well right now we already have this
05:56 - structure right here I am connected to
05:58 - my MacBook through this tnb core now I
06:02 - also have another chord that I spun up
06:04 - that I'll connect to in just a bit it's
06:06 - called vitaxia.io and it's just a VTX
06:10 - I'm using for the shorthand but check
06:12 - this out because what this system allows
06:15 - for is for me to connect to other
06:17 - devices through more than one core if
06:20 - let's say this tnb network ever goes
06:24 - offline I'll still have a way to connect
06:26 - to or communicate with these other
06:28 - devices so again like I said it isn't
06:31 - absolutely necessary to use this since
06:34 - this form of communication is fine just
06:36 - one core however it does allow for some
06:39 - increased fault tolerance which I don't
06:41 - know I thought was a pretty cool feature
06:42 - so let's actually connect to it right
06:45 - now know
06:47 - no use just talking about it so the
06:49 - network ID is
06:51 - ataxia.io protocol it's https VTX and
06:57 - there's my logo
06:58 - all right looking good now I already
07:01 - have a balance in there because I
07:03 - credited this account before this
07:04 - tutorial so I don't need to go and
07:06 - Django admin do it again
07:08 - so now let's go ahead and finally take a
07:10 - look at some of these apps that we built
07:12 - and let's go ahead and get things
07:14 - started with this speed test app all
07:17 - right so for those who didn't follow
07:19 - along with the last tutorial Series this
07:21 - is what we built the speed test app and
07:24 - it's kind of like the Hello World app
07:25 - for this architecture because what it
07:29 - uses is a very simple ping pong protocol
07:31 - to pretty much find the fastest
07:33 - connection between two devices
07:35 - and I'll show you what I'm talking about
07:36 - right now
07:37 - so you first select a device that you
07:40 - want and I'm going to go ahead and
07:42 - select my MacBook it's the only device
07:44 - I'm connected to and then you can choose
07:46 - what network you want to connect through
07:49 - and so let me go ahead and test the
07:52 - speed through the New Boston Network and
07:53 - then I'll test the speed through the
07:54 - taxi app so I'm going to go ahead and
07:56 - hit this go button and whenever I do
07:59 - what this device is going to do is it's
08:01 - going to send a request a ping request
08:04 - to this MacBook and that MacBook is
08:06 - going to send back a pong request and
08:09 - then this timer pretty much just you
08:11 - know calculates the total time it took
08:12 - and there you go so let me do a couple
08:15 - to get a good average right here
08:17 - and all right
08:18 - so
08:20 - and let me show you in the diagram
08:21 - what's going on as well all right so
08:24 - right now I'm testing this connection
08:25 - connecting through the New Boston
08:27 - network from my iMac to my MacBook and
08:31 - on average well I don't know the average
08:33 - of this maybe like a 0.8 or something we
08:37 - got
08:38 - 1.1.4 and somewhere around a half a
08:41 - second
08:42 - so now let me go ahead and connect and
08:44 - see if this network is any faster so let
08:47 - me go ahead and time this
08:49 - all right that one's pretty slow
08:51 - all right looks like the same speed
08:54 - maybe VTX is just a little bit faster
08:57 - but like I said this is pretty much the
09:00 - point of the speed test app it allows
09:02 - you to test connections and also the
09:04 - speed of those connections and if you
09:07 - ever want to clear your history just you
09:10 - can click this little icon and it'll
09:12 - delete all of your runs
09:14 - and that's it pretty simple app but very
09:17 - useful as well now the next app we can
09:19 - check out is this chat app now also keep
09:23 - in mind that in this architecture
09:24 - there's no centralized databases to
09:27 - store any of this app data instead all
09:30 - this app data is stored directly on the
09:32 - devices themselves so just keep this in
09:34 - mind whenever we're chatting right here
09:36 - and on that note let me go ahead and
09:38 - create a new chat course I'm gonna be
09:40 - chatting with my MacBook it's the only
09:43 - only device I'm connected to right now
09:45 - and this is a pretty you know standard
09:48 - chat application you can send messages
09:51 - uh you can edit messages hey there
09:56 - you can delete messages
09:59 - and what else can you do you can send
10:02 - credits as well so let's say I want to
10:04 - send
10:05 - a 50 tnb like here are some credits
10:11 - uh send you 50 just like that
10:14 - and you can also another core feature
10:17 - that it built is if you click this
10:19 - little paper clip you can attach
10:20 - accounts
10:22 - and also networks so let me how can I
10:27 - demonstrate this actually let me go
10:28 - ahead and do this I'm going to go in my
10:31 - network manager and just delete this VTX
10:33 - Network
10:34 - and I want to show you this because what
10:38 - I'll do now is go on my MacBook and I'll
10:40 - send over this so
10:43 - I'm gonna send over the VTX Network I
10:46 - know you can't see this but uh
10:48 - and I'm also going to attach an account
10:50 - as well so now let me send over these
10:53 - two
10:56 - and all right so oh looks like my
11:00 - grandma is using tnb OS as well so right
11:03 - now the MacBook sent me an account and
11:08 - this network that I just deleted if I
11:10 - ever want to update it like let's say oh
11:13 - yes I want this network as well I just
11:15 - have to click this button in the middle
11:18 - and then there you go you see that is
11:20 - now added and of course my accounts
11:22 - let's see that
11:24 - oh my grandma's online and I want to of
11:28 - course add her chat with her I can just
11:30 - click that and look at that I now have
11:32 - my grandma's account she actually isn't
11:34 - online at the moment maybe she's taking
11:36 - a nap or something but there you go
11:40 - so again pretty simple chat application
11:42 - but uh I don't know I thought it was
11:45 - pretty cool to make uh even a simple
11:47 - chat app without the use of any middle
11:50 - man or intermediary so yeah pretty cool
11:53 - what else do we got here
11:56 - let's take a look at the University app
11:59 - next all right so this of course is one
12:03 - of our pride and joys the university app
12:07 - so of course this app is for creating uh
12:10 - organizing sharing educational content
12:12 - with one another
12:13 - and whenever I open this you saw that
12:16 - there were these courses right here so
12:19 - these are all courses that were created
12:21 - and are being hosted from my MacBook and
12:25 - you can you know pretty much just like
12:27 - any other uh
12:29 - um educational platform you can click
12:31 - into one of these courses
12:32 - and you can take the course and whenever
12:35 - you take a course what it does is it
12:37 - just moves it from this browse section
12:39 - to my courses pretty much just for like
12:41 - better organization
12:43 - you can also clone the course and what
12:46 - this does is well you'll see in just a
12:50 - bit let me get back to this don't want
12:52 - to throw too many things at once now for
12:54 - any of these courses you can of course
12:55 - just click into the lecture and you can
12:58 - watch it
13:01 - it's uh has some responsive Behavior
13:03 - right here although I'm seeing right now
13:05 - that this view is probably a little bit
13:08 - too small with the video so I'm gonna
13:10 - work on that
13:11 - but either way back to this cloning
13:14 - courses logic whenever you clone a
13:16 - course what it does is it pretty much
13:18 - copies the course over as your own
13:20 - course so as a teacher you can create
13:24 - your own or you can clone those are two
13:26 - ways to kind of uh create your own
13:28 - courses so most of the time you are
13:30 - going to be creating your own however I
13:32 - found whenever you're like working on a
13:35 - course with someone else that the Clone
13:36 - logic was uh just useful but either way
13:39 - once you have a course you can just go
13:41 - ahead and edit it it won't be live to
13:44 - other devices until you publish it
13:46 - so I'm not going to publish that because
13:48 - this is already being hosted for my
13:50 - MacBook but another thing I just want to
13:52 - show you is that your lectures right
13:54 - here
13:55 - if you ever want to create a new one or
13:57 - edit one
13:59 - and then there you go and also you can
14:01 - sort your lectures
14:04 - if you ever want to do that made this
14:07 - nice little sorting logic
14:10 - and uh yeah there you go now just a
14:13 - heads up as well whenever a course is
14:15 - published then any changes to that
14:18 - course are going to be reflected on any
14:19 - other devices in real time so for
14:22 - example say that my MacBook was editing
14:24 - this course to change the name of it let
14:27 - me just say python
14:30 - uh bacon or something and on my MacBook
14:33 - let me go ahead and submit those changes
14:35 - right now you see that this updated to
14:38 - python bacon and if I ever unpublish
14:41 - that course let me unpublish it for my
14:44 - MacBook then it's just going to
14:45 - disappear from my uh well any other
14:49 - device so just want to uh point that out
14:52 - because if you have a course published
14:54 - and then you're making changes to it
14:56 - then just note that on everyone else's
14:58 - devices then they're gonna see all those
15:00 - changes in real time so I would highly
15:02 - recommend unpublishing it making all
15:04 - your changes and then publish it
15:06 - whenever it's ready but either way that
15:08 - is the University app next up let's go
15:11 - ahead and take a look at this shop app
15:15 - now the shop app is a cool way that you
15:17 - can exchange goods with your you know
15:19 - friends and family without the use of
15:21 - any intermediary
15:23 - and on that note let's go ahead and see
15:25 - what we got available right here see
15:27 - some cool t-shirts
15:29 - oh the classic one I think I might have
15:32 - to snag this one
15:33 - all right
15:36 - and let me see what else I got
15:40 - I think I got like 10 000 credits so
15:43 - wavelength this is actually a pretty
15:44 - cool game mushroom book fun fact the
15:47 - network architecture is largely inspired
15:50 - off of the mycelium Network or the uh
15:53 - mushroom Network and
15:56 - let's see if there's anything else
15:59 - oh Old man carving this is pretty cool
16:02 - but don't think I can afford that let me
16:04 - go ahead and uh
16:07 - this is tough decision okay let me go
16:09 - ahead and get these uh elephant
16:11 - figurines all right now before I can go
16:15 - ahead and check out I need to go ahead
16:17 - and add my address
16:19 - so let me go ahead and do that add
16:21 - address say Bucky Roberts
16:26 - United States of America and there you
16:28 - go address added now if I go to my
16:31 - checkout it's going to default to this
16:33 - but if you have more then it's gonna
16:36 - allow you to select them since I only
16:38 - have one it knows to use that as a
16:40 - default and now that everything looks
16:42 - good let me go ahead and place this
16:45 - order
16:45 - now whenever I do I'm going to be taken
16:47 - to my orders page and you can see that
16:52 - we already have a couple things that
16:54 - were well they're actually done really
16:56 - quickly but um what happened behind the
16:59 - scenes is that whenever I made that
17:01 - order what I did is I created this order
17:04 - object and I sent it over to my MacBook
17:06 - now my MacBook looked at everything make
17:09 - sure that you know all the data matched
17:11 - up I wasn't trying to get this shirt for
17:13 - like only a thousand credits or anything
17:15 - and then once it approved everything it
17:19 - sent me back that approval status and it
17:22 - also sent me this receiving address now
17:25 - why do we have another receiving address
17:28 - when I could just send the credits to
17:30 - that account directly well the reason is
17:33 - this let's say that the MacBook approved
17:36 - the order and then while it was waiting
17:39 - for me to send my payment that MacBook
17:41 - it just went offline well then I would
17:44 - send the payment and the MacBook would
17:46 - never receive it even when it came
17:48 - online it might have some more credits
17:50 - in the account but you know where did
17:52 - those credits come from so things can
17:54 - become kind of confusing this way
17:55 - whereas with this architecture what
17:58 - happens is whenever there's a separate
18:00 - receiving address then let's say my
18:03 - MacBook approved that order and then it
18:05 - went offline well now instead of sending
18:08 - it to the macbook's address I'll send it
18:09 - to this address now whenever that
18:11 - MacBook came back online all it needs to
18:14 - do is it needs to check this address and
18:17 - as long as there are the 5 000 credits
18:19 - in there then it knows that this payment
18:22 - has been made so again
18:25 - this really shouldn't happen because all
18:27 - this happens in a fraction of a second
18:29 - but just in the weird Edge case that the
18:32 - MacBook goes offline the moment right
18:34 - after it proves which again is very rare
18:36 - but this is just you know a little
18:38 - safety procedure in place for that
18:40 - but yeah as you can see I sent the 5000
18:43 - tnb and now I just pretty much sit back
18:45 - and wait to receive my elephant
18:47 - figurines and t-shirt looking forward to
18:49 - that now another cool feature that I
18:52 - just want to point out is that since
18:53 - these items have been purchased if I go
18:56 - back to buy you see that they are no
18:58 - longer available and this is just some
19:01 - automated behavior that my MacBook
19:04 - automatically like takes them out of
19:05 - their inventory uh whenever they've been
19:07 - purchased
19:09 - so now let's go on the flip side of this
19:10 - and see how to sell items so of course
19:13 - you can go to the cell section right
19:16 - here and then you can just add a product
19:18 - and what I am going to be adding is one
19:21 - of the hand carved
19:26 - Wooden Spoons that I created
19:29 - and I'll say
19:32 - fantastic
19:37 - wooden spoon
19:39 - and this is my image URL I want to
19:42 - receive tnb and how much is this going
19:45 - to be worth I would say about 800
19:48 - credits so check it out this
19:52 - this is actually
19:53 - um a wooden spoon that I carved I saw
19:56 - like a Netflix show or a YouTube video I
19:58 - can't even remember now about uh wooding
20:01 - like wood carvings so I bought this wood
20:05 - spoon carving kit off Amazon and well
20:08 - this is the result of it I would not
20:10 - recommend actually eating with it I'm
20:12 - pretty sure that you'd just get a ton of
20:13 - splinters in your mouth but this is the
20:16 - first ever
20:17 - probably the only one spoon I'm ever
20:20 - gonna carve but let me go ahead and
20:22 - activate that bad boy right now and all
20:25 - right so now this one spoon is for sale
20:29 - by me of course if I ever want to delete
20:31 - it deactivate it edit it yada yada all
20:34 - this is uh pretty intuitive and of
20:36 - course in your orders you can see uh any
20:40 - orders that you may have
20:42 - so I have some in there from before and
20:44 - oh look at this a new one it looks like
20:48 - my MacBook just bought my one spoon so
20:52 - look at this my MacBook putting those
20:55 - credits to use already very cool and now
20:58 - since my MacBook did just buy this you
21:00 - can see under products right here then
21:03 - it pretty much removes it from the
21:05 - inventory and that just make sure that
21:07 - like uh it can't be purchased twice so
21:10 - there you go while I am waiting for my
21:13 - elephant figurines and t-shirt I will be
21:15 - shipping this one spoon to sample buyer
21:18 - and I am sure they're going to be very
21:20 - happy with this incredibly high quality
21:22 - wooden spoon so that is pretty much the
21:25 - shop app and on that note let's go ahead
21:28 - and take a look at this last app which
21:31 - is trade so check it out now once users
21:35 - find the fastest connection using this
21:38 - speed test app what you can do is you
21:40 - can actually help them out by allowing
21:42 - them to exchange credits so how does
21:45 - this work well let's say that I want to
21:48 - allow other devices to exchange their
21:50 - credits for example trade tnb for VTX or
21:53 - VTX for DNB any other ones that were
21:55 - connected to so on and so forth well
21:57 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to go
22:00 - under this automated section to offers
22:02 - and I'm first going to make sure that I
22:04 - have this tnb is my Active network this
22:07 - is kind of like the base Network that
22:10 - everything is everything else is done in
22:12 - relation to and you'll see what I mean
22:14 - in just a second so I'm going to go
22:15 - ahead and offer terms
22:17 - and I'm going to select offer terms for
22:19 - VTX
22:20 - now what I'm saying is I'm going to
22:23 - allow you to exchange VTX for tnb now
22:26 - the purchase price for each VTX I'll
22:30 - just keep it simple and say 1tnb per one
22:33 - VTX now for the order minimum let me
22:36 - just go ahead and do 10 and as the
22:38 - maximum I'll do 10 000.
22:41 - and for the sale price is the same
22:43 - whether you want VTX or whether you want
22:46 - tnb again it's just a one for one order
22:50 - minimum 10 order maximum
22:53 - ten thousand
22:55 - all right looking good so now for this
22:57 - automation that I'm setting up let me go
23:00 - ahead and just review everything
23:01 - purchase term looking good so all that's
23:04 - good I'm going to enable buying and if
23:07 - all my sale terms look good I'm going to
23:09 - enable automated selling so now this is
23:12 - all set up where other devices can now
23:14 - trade either VTX for tnb or tnb for VTX
23:19 - now to demonstrate what this is like
23:21 - from the other devices perspective what
23:24 - I'm going to do is go to this manual
23:26 - section right here now I already set it
23:28 - up in the exact same way on my MacBook
23:31 - so again this is just like the uh
23:34 - um flip side perspective of it where
23:37 - let's say that I wanted to trade uh
23:40 - let's say that I want to trade some of
23:41 - my tnb and I wanted to receive VTX so I
23:45 - would go buy and I would just click buy
23:49 - VTX and how much did I want well let's
23:52 - say that I wanted a 260 VTS X and that
23:56 - was going to cost me 260 tnb well what
24:00 - I'm going to do now is I'm just going to
24:01 - hit Place purchase order
24:03 - and whenever I do this you see that a
24:06 - couple things happen right here
24:08 - but more or less at the end of the day I
24:11 - received VTX and I sent them tnb and if
24:15 - you're keeping an eye on my balance
24:17 - right here you probably noticed that
24:18 - that updated too now just real quick I
24:21 - want to talk about how this is working
24:23 - and it's kind of similar to the shop
24:25 - logic but a little a few more steps in
24:29 - one so more or less what I did is when I
24:33 - was about to purchase right here what
24:35 - I'm looking at right here is their offer
24:37 - terms now whenever I buy this what I'm
24:40 - doing is I'm creating an order
24:42 - so
24:44 - once I have the order created I then
24:48 - take that object and I send it over to
24:50 - my MacBook my MacBook who is the host in
24:53 - this example they're going to review
24:55 - everything basically to make sure that
24:57 - the terms of the order match whatever
24:59 - terms that they had in their offer and
25:01 - that you know they have enough credits
25:03 - to fill the order so on and so forth but
25:05 - either way once everything is approved
25:07 - then they're going to go ahead and mark
25:09 - the order is approved and also create
25:12 - that receiving address and send that
25:14 - both back over to me so at this point
25:17 - it's basically like yeah everything
25:19 - looked good here's my receiving address
25:21 - go ahead and send 260 tnb to this
25:24 - account now I did that in by I I mean
25:28 - you know this is all automated happens
25:29 - quickly in the background but now my
25:32 - iMac went ahead and it sent 260 tnb to
25:36 - this receiving address
25:38 - and then once it did I notified the
25:40 - MacBook again hey I sent that tnb go
25:45 - ahead and check it it checked it saw
25:47 - that there was indeed that amount in
25:49 - there and it went ahead and then filled
25:51 - my order
25:52 - Now by filling the order of course this
25:55 - means sending VTX to my receiving
25:58 - address and that's what this transaction
26:00 - is right here so actually this
26:03 - transaction is the final transaction
26:04 - where it takes it from my receiving
26:07 - address and moves it to my main account
26:09 - and that's why you see it has 258 here
26:12 - instead of 260 and that's because
26:14 - although my MacBook did indeed send 260
26:18 - credits one of those credits were pretty
26:20 - much used as a transaction fee for
26:23 - sending it to this receiving address and
26:25 - then whenever I moved those funds from
26:28 - the receiving address to my main account
26:30 - that was another one credit transaction
26:33 - fee so that's why at the end of this I
26:36 - only end up with 258 rather than 260 but
26:40 - you get the point so that's the main
26:42 - functionality of this trade app again
26:44 - pretty much to allow other devices to
26:46 - trade whatever credits they want for
26:50 - faster credits usually determined by the
26:52 - speed test app
26:54 - and I also have this little wallet
26:58 - section right here so under this wallet
27:01 - section you can pretty much choose which
27:04 - network and then you can view the
27:06 - transactions for that Network
27:08 - you can also send and receive
27:11 - but most of the time this is just going
27:13 - to be automated based on this manual or
27:17 - automated trading logic but yeah there
27:20 - you go now before I let you guys go I do
27:23 - want to talk very quickly about some
27:25 - items that we have on our roadmap
27:28 - now the first one this is just a rumor
27:30 - just want to throw this out there
27:32 - nothing is confirmed but I've been
27:34 - hearing a rumor that we may be working
27:37 - on a social network pretty soon
27:40 - I think it's a good idea still got to
27:42 - talk with the subcoins team to figure
27:43 - out exactly uh what's going on when we
27:45 - can get started on this but I thought it
27:48 - was a very good idea pretty much a way
27:50 - to connect to the people that you know
27:52 - and trust and also give users control
27:54 - over their own data so really looking
27:59 - forward to this now in addition to this
28:02 - we're also going to be introducing
28:04 - something called services and I'm super
28:06 - excited about this so it's a simple
28:09 - concept but it's going to allow us to
28:11 - build some very awesome apps
28:13 - now all a service is is just an
28:16 - automated program that we can interact
28:17 - with remotely
28:19 - now we are actually finishing up a
28:21 - python library for this which is going
28:24 - to make these super easy to build and
28:26 - I'm guessing that should be ready in a
28:28 - few weeks is my estimate and I'll let
28:31 - you guys know whenever it's uh complete
28:33 - but really Services can be written in
28:35 - any language
28:36 - now the most basic example of a simple
28:38 - service would just be a program that
28:41 - consists of a single function that can
28:44 - be called remotely for example if this
28:47 - device was you know running an app or
28:50 - some programming they wanted a random
28:51 - number it can make a request to say get
28:53 - random number and then this device would
28:55 - respond with it I imagine most of these
28:58 - are probably going to be ran on like a
28:59 - Raspberry Pi or something that can be
29:01 - online all the time without having to
29:03 - keep your laptop open but really since
29:06 - they're like programs that you can run
29:07 - them on your desktop your laptop a pi
29:09 - whatever so this would be a very basic
29:12 - service but
29:14 - copy this but you can have more
29:17 - complicated ones as well so say that we
29:20 - were making I don't know like a chat bot
29:23 - service that's what this was right here
29:25 - let me connect it to my little whoa
29:29 - don't want those kind we're the straight
29:31 - line there we go
29:33 - so let's say that this is a chat bot
29:35 - service what
29:37 - functions might a chat bot have
29:40 - um I don't know say this chatbot is a
29:42 - game where you can I don't know buy corn
29:45 - and what else could you do in this game
29:48 - uh maybe you could I guess you could eat
29:51 - corn if you could buy it and maybe this
29:53 - like gives you energy or something what
29:56 - else could you do
29:57 - suppose he could buy corn you could
30:00 - probably sell corn you know what I can't
30:02 - really think of any non-corn related
30:03 - examples right now but I'm sure you get
30:06 - the point
30:07 - now another service just to kind of uh I
30:10 - don't know I like brainstorming what all
30:12 - these Services can do
30:14 - let's say that we have another service
30:17 - that could be like an ethereum API like
30:21 - this example
30:23 - so let me delete these
30:27 - and show you what I'm talking about
30:31 - so
30:33 - let's say that we wanted to have a
30:35 - service to connect with the ethereum
30:38 - network now of course this would still
30:41 - be connected to
30:43 - the New Boston Network and let me just
30:46 - make a like a little Bridge
30:49 - some somehow show it's connected to the
30:52 - ethereum network but let's say that this
30:54 - device was not only connected to the New
30:56 - Boston network but the ethereum network
30:57 - as well it could offer a service to
31:00 - pretty much provide any ethereum data to
31:03 - any of these devices as well for example
31:05 - like fetch
31:07 - um
31:08 - address balance
31:10 - you can also what's a useful thing like
31:13 - get a gas price
31:16 - since if you want to send a transaction
31:18 - you need to know the current gas price
31:20 - uh so on and so forth just really trying
31:22 - to demonstrate that these devices can
31:24 - act as a bridge to other networks as
31:27 - well
31:28 - now in addition to these let me expand
31:30 - my network a little bit
31:33 - it's kind of wonky
31:35 - all right let's connect these to a VTX
31:38 - as well all right
31:40 - so what other service could we have
31:45 - um
31:46 - well we could have
31:49 - get out of here thing well we could have
31:51 - a service that
31:54 - posts a chess game
31:57 - let's say that uh some of these devices
31:59 - wanted to
32:01 - play chess
32:04 - then this bad boy right here could host
32:07 - the chess game and by the way you can
32:09 - also run multiple Services just on a
32:11 - single device I just uh I don't know
32:13 - don't wanna I thought it was easier to
32:16 - explain visually this way and another
32:18 - cool idea that I had for a service
32:22 - because in a way so far these surfaces
32:25 - kind of act like many microservices or
32:28 - like many servers or apis or something
32:31 - but because of the nature of how
32:34 - everything is set up it doesn't always
32:36 - have to be that you request data and
32:38 - then it sends it back like
32:40 - um you request some ethereum data and
32:42 - then it sends you back the gas price
32:44 - what you can do with these Services as
32:47 - well is have them push out information
32:50 - for example let's say that you had a
32:53 - service that was
32:55 - um tied to like some MMA data server
32:58 - whenever someone won an MMA fight you
33:01 - could have it broadcast the results of
33:04 - that to all other devices or maybe send
33:07 - out notifications whenever someone
33:12 - scores a goal in the World Cup game so
33:15 - again it doesn't always have to be that
33:17 - you request something and it sends it
33:18 - back it can also push out data as well
33:21 - now is the creator
33:23 - of a service you can get to decide if
33:27 - you want to offer your service for free
33:28 - just to help out the community or if you
33:31 - want to charge credits for your service
33:33 - now charging credits might be a good
33:35 - idea if your service is computationally
33:37 - expensive and in that way the fee is
33:39 - going to act as a throttle and some
33:41 - examples of this would be like let's say
33:43 - that your service is going to store data
33:46 - for other machines or maybe you have a
33:49 - service that you send data to and it
33:52 - processes it for like machine learning
33:54 - or AI learning or something like that
33:56 - well since those are computationally
33:58 - expensive operations you probably don't
34:01 - want to offer these for free I mean that
34:03 - would be cool if you do just for the
34:04 - community but I'm guessing that you
34:06 - probably want to stick a fee on that
34:07 - just to act as a throttle just so things
34:10 - don't you know get out of control
34:12 - so yeah I know well look at this now it
34:15 - seems like we started out creating a
34:17 - plant watering device ended up creating
34:20 - the singularity but whatever I mean
34:23 - that's cool too
34:24 - so on that note that's probably good for
34:27 - this video if anyone has any suggestions
34:30 - on how I can improve the UI then I would
34:34 - love to hear it also if anyone has any
34:37 - ideas for apps or other services that we
34:40 - could build then feel free to uh let me
34:43 - know I would love to hear them and for
34:45 - those interested in app development
34:47 - check out my react Redux and electron
34:49 - tutorials they are pretty much like
34:52 - tnbos app development tutorials because
34:55 - what we do is we go through and we build
34:57 - this speed test app which gives you like
34:59 - all the fundamental knowledge to build
35:01 - other apps as well
35:03 - and yeah I think uh I think that's all
35:06 - we needed to cover so
35:09 - thank you all for watching and yeah I'll
35:12 - see you next time
