00:00 - what is going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - 41st udk tutorial and in this tutorial
00:05 - I'm going to be introducing something to
00:07 - you guys called a kismet now what kismet
00:10 - is is it's basically you decays visual
00:14 - programming so what that means is well
00:17 - right now whenever we were playing our
00:20 - levels our user could pretty much just
00:21 - run around and shoot his gun and that's
00:23 - pretty much it not very exciting pretty
00:26 - boring if you ask me so in order to make
00:29 - this game more interactive we want to
00:31 - allow the user to do other things like
00:33 - open doors and turn on light switches
00:35 - and ride elevators and we just want to
00:39 - be able to interact with the environment
00:40 - other than you know just running around
00:43 - a shooting his gun into the air so in
00:45 - order to do this in order to give our
00:47 - player the functionality to accomplish
00:49 - all these things we need to use
00:51 - something called kismet now first and
00:54 - foremost you guys are probably looking
00:55 - around all right kismet kismet kismet
00:57 - where are you what the heck does this
00:58 - kismet thing look like well in order to
01:01 - open the kismet window you go up here
01:04 - and right next to your content browser
01:05 - you can see this little K with an arrow
01:08 - poking out of it and it says open unreal
01:10 - kismet so if we go ahead and click that
01:12 - then this is our kismet window and again
01:16 - we're not just ready to step into this
01:19 - window right now I just want to show you
01:20 - guys how to access kismet and it is
01:23 - indeed a thing I'm not lying about it so
01:25 - we'll get into this when it's time but
01:27 - for right now what I'm going to be doing
01:29 - is in these upcoming tutorials I'm just
01:31 - going to build a really simple example
01:34 - for you guys i'm just going to be making
01:35 - a simple switch that our player can turn
01:38 - on and off and when he does it turns a
01:40 - light bulb on and off so again i just
01:42 - want to show you guys a real quick
01:44 - example of how you can make a level and
01:46 - use kismet to give the user something to
01:49 - interact with and later on i'm going to
01:51 - be building some more complex
01:53 - functionality using kismet so for right
01:56 - now like i said we need a very simple
01:58 - level so i'm just going to go ahead and
02:00 - right click on my brush and this can
02:03 - change this to 2048
02:05 - and 2048 and i'll leave my Z at 32 and
02:09 - build and in my perspective view if I
02:12 - hit be my builder brush will come back
02:14 - up and I just want to add some mass to
02:16 - my level and hit be again hide my
02:18 - builder brush so again all I'm building
02:20 - is a very flat level somewhere for my
02:22 - player to run around on so right after
02:25 - this since we want to play this level
02:27 - I'm just going to go ahead and add a
02:28 - light now what I'm going to be doing is
02:30 - I'm going to hold down l and left click
02:32 - and I'm going to add a light in this
02:34 - corner of the room and the reason let me
02:38 - just scroll out here let me position my
02:41 - light so it lights up about half of the
02:44 - room right here now what am I going to
02:46 - be building is a system where there's a
02:50 - light switch in the middle and whenever
02:52 - the user clicks it a light bulb lights
02:54 - up the other half of the room so make
02:56 - sure that you don't have this light bulb
02:57 - cover the entire room or else you're not
02:59 - going to be able to tell when the other
03:01 - let you is on or off so that's why I
03:02 - built this to cover only half of the
03:04 - room so now what I want to do is I want
03:07 - to add a static mesh right over here
03:10 - remember whenever I was teaching you
03:12 - guys about static meshes and I told you
03:14 - guys that what you do is you add a light
03:16 - static mesh and then you add an actual
03:18 - game light on top of it just to simulate
03:21 - a light coming from that static mesh
03:23 - well that's what I'm going to be doing
03:24 - again so I'm going to be going in my
03:27 - content browser and clear everything out
03:30 - all assets X and clear and just go ahead
03:34 - and look for light again and make sure
03:36 - you're looking in static meshes and now
03:39 - when you find one you like I'm just
03:41 - going to use that same light from last
03:43 - time work that pretty good that time
03:44 - right here what i can do is drag this
03:47 - out right on my screen in my perspective
03:49 - view and there I go so what I'm going to
03:52 - be doing first and foremost is bumping
03:54 - up the scale to three times it's normal
03:56 - size and then I'm just going to be
03:59 - dragging it up and dragging it over in
04:03 - the corner somewhere so if we look in my
04:05 - perspective view we can see that indeed
04:09 - this light
04:11 - is in the corner right there but there's
04:13 - no light coming from it so what I'm
04:14 - going to be doing eventually is adding
04:16 - one of these game lights right next to
04:18 - the slice so then whenever we turn this
04:20 - game light on and off it's going to look
04:22 - like this light is turning on and off a
04:24 - pretty cool trick huh kind of to a trick
04:27 - my viewers so that's what I'm going to
04:30 - be doing in the upcoming sorrows I
04:32 - actually don't know how long this
04:33 - tutorial was because I forgot to look at
04:35 - this camera I mean excuse me this clock
04:37 - before but I guess that that's what
04:40 - we're going to be doing in the upcoming
04:41 - or oh so that's what you guys have to
04:43 - look forward to but for now that's all
04:45 - you guys get so thank you guys for
04:46 - watching don't forget to subscribe and
04:48 - I'll see you guys next time
