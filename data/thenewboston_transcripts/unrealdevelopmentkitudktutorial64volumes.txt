00:00 - what's going on guys welcome to your
00:01 - 64th udk tutorial and in this tutorial
00:04 - I'm going to be talking to you guys
00:05 - about something called volumes now if
00:07 - you're kind of getting annoyed by this
00:09 - menu and these buttons right here
00:11 - because they're sitting there in our
00:12 - interface but I never really talked
00:14 - about what they were that's what I'm
00:15 - going to be covering in this tutorial so
00:17 - let me explain to you guys verbally what
00:19 - volumes are first volumes are pretty
00:22 - much just areas of space that you can
00:24 - set up to do different things now it's
00:27 - kind of hard to explain it verbally but
00:29 - once I go ahead and show you guys an
00:31 - example it's going to be crystal clear
00:33 - so let me go ahead and show you guys
00:35 - when and why you would use a volume so
00:37 - say you're making this level and you put
00:39 - this trigger right here well we can
00:41 - change a couple properties on the
00:42 - trigger we can make it taller or we can
00:45 - make the cylinder wider give it a bigger
00:47 - radius but it's always going to be a
00:50 - cylinder so what if you wanted to make a
00:53 - custom shape so the years you didn't go
00:54 - around it or you know you just wanted a
00:57 - shape different than a cylinder because
00:59 - it would better fit your level well this
01:01 - trigger just isn't going to work so go
01:03 - ahead and delete your trigger and what
01:05 - this is saying is all right Bucky you're
01:07 - deleting it in the view but it's still
01:09 - going to be in your Kismet so let me go
01:11 - ahead and continue and open up Kismet
01:14 - and delete it in there just to make it
01:15 - happy so what we're going to be doing is
01:18 - basically adding a customized trigger
01:20 - shape called a volume so go ahead and
01:23 - select your Builder brush and if you go
01:25 - ahead and right click it give it 512 by
01:29 - 30 two by 256 tall is good enough and
01:32 - then I'm going to go ahead and hit build
01:34 - and now this gives you the general shape
01:37 - and we can go ahead and make a volume of
01:39 - this shape but I'm going to be doing a
01:40 - couple things more to it so in my side
01:43 - view what I'm going to be doing is
01:44 - centering this right in front of the
01:47 - door looks pretty good and I'm also
01:50 - going to be in my front view just
01:53 - bringing it right about there so if you
01:56 - actually go ahead and look in my
01:58 - perspective view you can see that this
02:00 - area which is going to be eventually the
02:02 - area of a trigger is sitting right in
02:05 - front of my door but we want to fix the
02:07 - problem that you know I told you guys
02:08 - about we want to make sure that the user
02:10 - or the player rather doesn't sneak in
02:13 - between the side of the wall and the
02:15 - door here and kind of sneak past this
02:17 - volume so what we're going to want to be
02:20 - doing is we want to give it more of a
02:22 - customized shape so go ahead and hop
02:24 - over in Geometry mode and if I go ahead
02:27 - and select this face right here I can go
02:29 - ahead and let me move this maybe move
02:32 - this so you guys can see a little bit
02:33 - better go ahead and hop over to extrude
02:36 - mode and I I talked to you guys about
02:38 - extrude mode before so it basically lets
02:40 - you customize the shape of your volume
02:44 - and that looks pretty good over there so
02:45 - now I'm just going to be doing that with
02:47 - the other
02:50 - side so make sure that they're both
02:53 - relatively even usually whenever you're
02:55 - making a game then you want to you know
02:57 - take your time and make sure that this
02:58 - and this are both even but for the sake
03:00 - of this tutorial it's good enough so
03:03 - also with extrude Mode still on I'm
03:05 - going to go ahead and select this
03:08 - face and probably my front view would be
03:11 - the best just pull it so it hits that
03:14 - castle wall looks pretty good and also
03:17 - select this face right here and pull
03:20 - that so it matches up right with that so
03:23 - now we can go ahead and exit out of this
03:24 - geometry mode and what I have now is a
03:27 - customiz shape that wraps around the
03:30 - door completely so now my user of course
03:33 - can't jump over this you can't go
03:34 - underneath it we don't have the problem
03:36 - of a trigger where it's only a specific
03:39 - shape which is a cylinder we can pretty
03:41 - much make customized shapes so right now
03:43 - this is just a weird looking Builder
03:45 - brush so how do we turn this into a
03:47 - volume if we go ahead and hit this
03:49 - button add volume we can go ahead and
03:51 - select let me see if I can find a
03:53 - trigger volume right there and what this
03:55 - does is it makes this trigger volume the
03:58 - same exact shape and the reason we can't
03:59 - see any changes is because our Builder
04:02 - brush is in the way so let's go ahead
04:03 - and slide that out and actually hit B to
04:06 - hide your Builder brush and now you can
04:08 - see we have this green
04:10 - volume that is like a customized shape
04:13 - perfectly to fit our map so we're saying
04:16 - all right so this is a trigger so can we
04:19 - just treat it exactly like a trigger
04:21 - well yes you can anything that you can
04:23 - do with the trigger you can do with this
04:26 - this is basically a customized trigger
04:28 - so go ahead and select it and open
04:30 - Kismet and if you go ahead and right
04:33 - click you can now see new event using
04:35 - trigger volume to and just make it a
04:38 - touch event which means whenever you
04:40 - touch any of this area then this matina
04:43 - is going to play and that is of course
04:45 - if we drag over this touch and plug it
04:47 - into play so now what's going to happen
04:49 - is this we set up a customized volume
04:52 - which is pretty much a customized shaped
04:54 - trigger and now what happens is whenever
04:57 - our character runs into this trigger
04:59 - volume hits this volume or this space in
05:02 - any kind of way the matina is going to
05:03 - play and if you guys forgot the matina
05:05 - just turned this door from Red into
05:07 - green so if you guys don't believe me
05:10 - let me go ahead and hit Play From
05:14 - Here and Now let me go ahead and see I'm
05:17 - not hitting my volume yet but now when I
05:21 - do you see it slowly changed from red to
05:24 - Green I could have made that a little
05:25 - more exciting maybe I should make it
05:27 - move or something but hey I'm too lazy
05:29 - to do that so that is basically what a
05:31 - volume is and again I only went over a
05:34 - trigger volume which is one type of
05:36 - volume but we have massive amounts of
05:38 - volume again we didn't cover a lot of
05:41 - this stuff yet so you know like
05:42 - postprocess and um physics volumes but
05:47 - we'll get into that later so anyways now
05:49 - that you understand the basics of what
05:51 - volumes are and how to use them you're
05:52 - ready to move on to the uh I don't know
05:54 - whatever heck I'm going to touch teach
05:56 - next so thank you guys for watching
05:58 - don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
05:59 - you guys later here
