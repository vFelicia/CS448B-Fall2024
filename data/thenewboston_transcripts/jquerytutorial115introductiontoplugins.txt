00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this video we go we are going to take
00:08 - a look at jQuery plugins just take a
00:12 - look at what they are what they can do
00:14 - how we would search for plugins and some
00:17 - other information as well that might
00:18 - help you when you're going and choosing
00:21 - a plug-in to use now obviously when we
00:24 - have a normal file for example I just
00:27 - have index dot PHP open in my browser
00:29 - we've included jQuery and perhaps an
00:32 - external script if required however
00:34 - that's not always necessary obviously
00:38 - the external script just goes ahead and
00:40 - make sure we don't need to use any
00:42 - JavaScript on this page we just include
00:45 - the file now if you wanted to go ahead
00:48 - and actually add to the current jQuery
00:51 - library there's a list of plugins
00:53 - available on the jQuery comm website so
00:57 - if we go over to jQuery comm we can go
01:00 - ahead and click the plugins tab you can
01:03 - browse here the main page that comes up
01:06 - is browsing by type however let's just
01:08 - go ahead to top plugins and take a look
01:11 - down the list now plugins are
01:14 - essentially built for the purpose of if
01:16 - you have some kind of functionality you
01:19 - need to add to your website however
01:22 - you're not comfortable with writing it
01:23 - yourself and you need a quick way to
01:25 - implement something usually visual into
01:28 - your script there's a lot of options
01:31 - available in in the form of plugins so
01:36 - just looking down this list you can see
01:37 - a few already we're gonna go over and
01:40 - we're gonna take a look at the let's
01:43 - have a look let's find it let's just
01:48 - come down the page we've got one here
01:51 - called where was it gone
02:03 - well I can't find the original one I was
02:05 - looking for but let's just go for this
02:07 - one here the rich text HTML editor now
02:11 - once you've found a plug-in of your
02:14 - choice go ahead and read the description
02:16 - in this case this one is still in beta
02:19 - testing so obviously looking out for
02:23 - these kinds of things are important now
02:25 - you love and find the Downloads link or
02:27 - you can view the the original page that
02:30 - this is from so it'll be perhaps
02:32 - someone's personal blog or something and
02:35 - then you can go ahead and actually
02:36 - download the plug-in so another way you
02:39 - can do this is to go ahead and just
02:42 - perform a simple google search for let's
02:44 - say jQuery plugins just here we found an
02:48 - article 30 fantastic new jQuery plugins
02:52 - 37 more shocking jQuery plugins and
02:55 - these kinds of results often show you
02:58 - quick demos so they have quick online
03:01 - demos as well as linking to the original
03:04 - authors demos as well
03:06 - these might also not be listed on the
03:09 - jQuery website so you might find
03:11 - additional query of jQuery plugins that
03:15 - have been written by people and just
03:16 - posted on their own personal website for
03:19 - example and the other benefit is you'll
03:21 - get reviews as well so people will be
03:23 - reviewing this plug-in and giving it a
03:25 - bit of a rating so they'll probably give
03:28 - it some kind of rating as well as that
03:31 - obviously the titles just go to show
03:34 - that they've collected together a good
03:36 - and you know a good collection of
03:38 - plugins to show to the user obviously
03:41 - they wouldn't be blogging about it if
03:44 - they weren't very good so plugins can be
03:47 - implemented into a page once you've
03:49 - downloaded them as you would jQuery
03:51 - we've already mentioned that briefly and
03:53 - you would do it somewhat similar to how
03:55 - we've done it here but obviously you
03:57 - would always go ahead and read the
03:58 - instructions on the user's website or
04:01 - the plug-in description on jQuery comm
04:03 - now the majority of the time when
04:06 - server-side processing is required
04:09 - PHP will be used because it's such an
04:11 - available and easy to to write language
04:14 - so if you are downloading plugins make
04:17 - sure you check if you have any
04:19 - additional files there that might use
04:22 - Ajax requests to PHP documents so make
04:25 - sure you have a PHP enabled server
04:27 - before you download these or that we
04:29 - know used to and make sure you're
04:31 - comfortable with using this PHP
04:32 - processing as well obviously there are
04:35 - other web development languages that can
04:37 - be used however the majority of the time
04:40 - PHP is the most popular another thing to
04:44 - point out is that when you return to say
04:46 - jQuery com always take a look at the
04:49 - version number as well we've already
04:50 - noted that this re-edit are rich text
04:55 - HTML editor is in beta testing and this
04:58 - will have beta just here so always check
05:01 - back just to see if there's an updated
05:03 - version of a particular plug-in this
05:05 - might be for security reasons this might
05:09 - be for functionality reasons it might
05:11 - even be edited or changed to keep up
05:14 - with jQuery original library so you
05:16 - might see new functions appear or if you
05:19 - use a different version of jQuery a more
05:21 - updated version you might see the
05:23 - functionality in the in the plug-in
05:26 - disappear because something might have
05:28 - changed so always check back on either
05:30 - the author's website or jQuery comm
05:32 - depending where you got this from to
05:35 - check the latest version now the other
05:37 - thing is if we will return to our text
05:40 - editor if you were to go ahead and
05:42 - install a jQuery plug-in for absolutely
05:44 - everything for example there are jQuery
05:47 - plugins that can reference or select a
05:51 - text area and limit the input of text
05:54 - and display how many characters are
05:56 - remaining for example now this is
05:58 - relatively easy to do with jQuery alone
06:01 - so a plug-in might not be required if
06:04 - you tend to add a lot of plugins to your
06:07 - page you're gonna find it's going to
06:09 - bloat your document out with lots of
06:10 - unnecessary code so by implementing too
06:13 - many plugins you might be slowing down
06:15 - your script so it's probably better to
06:18 - only use plugins where
06:20 - the work can't be done any more quickly
06:23 - than you'd be able to do it or that
06:25 - might not work as well so if you're new
06:27 - to jQuery you probably might feel the
06:30 - temptation to go ahead and install a
06:32 - load of plugins and use them from
06:33 - different parts of the website now apart
06:36 - from the downsides that I have mentioned
06:39 - you might get plug-in conflicts as well
06:42 - depending on how well the plugins are
06:44 - written so there are many problems to
06:47 - adding too much JavaScript to a page
06:49 - you're going to completely decrease the
06:51 - loading time so only look for plugins
06:53 - that you wouldn't be able to write
06:55 - yourself not just saying we wouldn't be
06:57 - able to write yourself off the top of
06:59 - your head but try and research different
07:01 - ways to do things before you go and
07:03 - install plugins the example I gave we
07:05 - could create a text area and for example
07:10 - say you wanted to limit this to a
07:11 - certain amount of characters this might
07:13 - be called text over in another file you
07:16 - might go and write something like text
07:21 - dot counter for example or countdown and
07:27 - this might implement some kind of system
07:32 - to say allow only 200 characters and
07:35 - countdown as the user starts typing now
07:38 - we've already looked at a tutorial in
07:39 - this tutorial series when we can where
07:41 - we can do this therefore if you create
07:44 - your own code and go ahead and keep that
07:46 - up to scratch and keep that working well
07:48 - you are minimizing Maat well you in some
07:52 - cases minimizing the amount of codes you
07:54 - require often plugins come with
07:56 - unnecessary styling and also if you've
07:59 - got if you're going to go ahead and
08:00 - write your own plugins or just include
08:02 - your own function functionality for
08:04 - example in an external javascript file
08:06 - you're also able to style this exactly
08:09 - as you want you could come over to a
08:11 - stylesheet and star this exact exactly
08:13 - as you want not saying that plugins
08:15 - aren't useful but try to only install
08:18 - plug-ins where you feel like you
08:19 - wouldn't be able to do anything that
08:22 - would produce the same effect so that's
08:24 - a quick introduction on plugins in the
08:26 - next couple of videos we're going to be
08:27 - picking some specific plugins and we're
08:30 - going to be learning how to install them
08:31 - just so we can get
08:32 - to grips with downloading and installing
08:35 - and implementing plugins so that was a
08:38 - quick introduction on jQuery plugins
