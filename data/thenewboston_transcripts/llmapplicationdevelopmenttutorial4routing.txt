00:00 - all righty guys welcome back to another
00:02 - video and in this one we are going to
00:04 - talk about a concept called routing so
00:08 - as your application scales you may find
00:10 - that it gets difficult to really have a
00:14 - single big prompt that does everything
00:16 - that you need it to not only is it going
00:18 - to be difficult to maintain but it's
00:20 - going to be difficult to evaluate as
00:22 - well now instead what you're likely
00:25 - going to find is that it's better to
00:27 - have smaller specialized prompts that
00:30 - are better at responding to a certain
00:32 - category of questions kind of similar to
00:34 - how we have been developing them so far
00:37 - so let's pretend that this application
00:39 - got released this little chat bot in
00:42 - that after a month of just looking at
00:44 - user traffic figuring out what questions
00:46 - they're asking we saw that there were
00:49 - really three big categories of questions
00:52 - and we'll go with this example that
00:53 - we've been sticking with one of the
00:55 - categories of questions that we've been
00:57 - getting in was questions about the bot
00:59 - itself
01:00 - stuff like what is your name or what is
01:03 - your purpose or what llm do you use the
01:06 - other category of questions that we'll
01:08 - pretend that we got in were questions
01:10 - about the video so in the last video we
01:13 - saw we could create this prompt right
01:15 - here IA video and we can inject a video
01:18 - transcript as well as a source code into
01:21 - it and that this worked really well for
01:23 - answering questions about the video we
01:25 - even saw that in the
01:26 - evaluation now the last section right
01:30 - here let's just say that if we get a
01:32 - question in and it wasn't about ya
01:35 - wasn't about the bot and it wasn't about
01:37 - the video then we could assume that it
01:39 - was just like a general programming
01:41 - question how do I fix this bug um I have
01:44 - a missing semicolon what am I supposed
01:45 - to do so on and so forth so what we
01:48 - could do is now that we notice that
01:50 - three these are three big categories we
01:53 - can go ahead and create prompt templates
01:55 - like we have been that's responsible for
01:57 - each one but now we have the problem of
02:00 - whenever that question first comes in we
02:03 - now have to decide which category or in
02:06 - other words which prompt template to use
02:08 - for that question and in this case what
02:12 - the solution would be is this router
02:14 - prompt template and that's what we're
02:16 - going to be building in this video a
02:18 - router prompt template that intakes a
02:21 - question and responds with a single word
02:23 - either self video or general and then in
02:27 - our application code what we can do is
02:28 - we can use that to map it to a prompt
02:31 - template and that way we can develop our
02:34 - system to really keep things very
02:37 - modularized which of course is going to
02:40 - help with development a lot and also
02:42 - it's going to simplify the evaluation
02:44 - process because now our evaluations they
02:46 - don't have to test this whole slew of
02:48 - all these random questions we can
02:50 - develop our prompts so that they're a
02:52 - bit more specialized because just like
02:54 - in programming whenever you have a
02:55 - function and it becomes too big it's
02:59 - difficult to test and difficult to
03:00 - maintain so we want to take that same
03:02 - concept and apply it to llm application
03:05 - development as well so on that note
03:07 - let's go ahead and hop over here and in
03:10 - the University I'm going to go ahead and
03:12 - create a new template and I'll just call
03:14 - it
03:15 - a
03:17 - router and then let me just change this
03:19 - to Ginger 2 and for the system prompt we
03:22 - can say something like you are an AI
03:26 - that helps people with
03:31 - questions related to uh
03:36 - programming tutorial videos and I just
03:38 - want to give it context of like what its
03:40 - purpose is even though this doesn't help
03:43 - with the exact output just to um you
03:45 - know give it a little better
03:47 - understanding of what we're using it for
03:49 - so now we can kind of give it more
03:51 - Direction and say given a
03:56 - question your job is to categorize it
04:02 - to one of
04:05 - three categories and we will
04:09 - say since we're looking for either self
04:12 - video or general we'll say self and
04:15 - we'll say
04:17 - for questions about yourself such
04:23 - as what is your name good to give it a
04:25 - little example here and then we'll say
04:28 - video so so respond with this for video
04:33 - specific questions and we can say
04:35 - something
04:37 - like um we actually use an example that
04:40 - we used in our evals from last video uh
04:43 - what words print out in the first Loop
04:48 - and this is also why I like to say that
04:51 - you're an AI that helps with programming
04:53 - uh related questions basically because
04:55 - then this makes a little bit more sense
04:57 - has some context of what a loop is
05:00 - and then we'll say General and we'll
05:02 - just say that this is for all other
05:06 - questions and we can go ahead and just
05:08 - set we'll try 3.5 see how that works out
05:12 - and then I just want to re-emphasize
05:14 - that your response should be one word
05:18 - only okay so the last thing we need in
05:21 - here is just a placeorder for the
05:25 - question and that's just singular
05:27 - question there we go so I'm going to
05:29 - create this template next next all right
05:34 - so now that our template is created
05:36 - let's go ahead and test this bad boy out
05:39 - so I already created this data set and I
05:42 - just have five questions here and I'll
05:45 - go through them real quick um again each
05:47 - of these questions and let me download
05:49 - this while I'm waiting so file download
05:52 - CSV all right download okay so the first
05:55 - one is just what is your name and again
05:58 - this should be easy we gave it as the
05:59 - example example that the second one is
06:02 - just actually these next two are just
06:03 - like General programming questions so
06:06 - those should end up in the general
06:08 - bucket and then these last two questions
06:11 - right here what is to return value of
06:13 - the main function from the video and
06:15 - what is the name of the class from the
06:17 - video again we're really helping it out
06:19 - here by saying from the video but uh for
06:23 - now again this is just like a really
06:24 - simple data set whenever we are
06:27 - releasing this in production you
06:28 - actually want to go through make a much
06:31 - bigger more extensive data set but for
06:33 - right now testing out uh this will be
06:35 - fine to demonstrate the concepts so what
06:37 - I'm going to do from here is just
06:39 - evaluate it by clicking on
06:41 - evaluate and I again am just going to
06:43 - name it similar to this which is router
06:46 - so I'll name the pipeline
06:47 - [Music]
06:51 - router and for the data sets let me
06:54 - upload that so
06:56 - upload my download router
07:00 - and I'll say router data set just like
07:04 - that all right so select my data set
07:07 - choose select data set and create my
07:09 - Pipeline and now I can just hook it up
07:12 - by clicking add new column and then we
07:15 - just want to hook up the prompt template
07:16 - that we just created so prompt templates
07:19 - and for this I will say the llm response
07:23 - and now for the prompt template what was
07:25 - it this IR router uh we'll just use the
07:28 - latest version
07:30 - and then for the model engine uh we
07:32 - won't select any defaults because we
07:34 - already set our model prams on the
07:36 - prompt template itself so it's just
07:38 - going to pick up those and for question
07:40 - I'm just going to select the
07:42 - question and all right run step so this
07:45 - was the actual answer and we'll see what
07:49 - I responds and actually we're going to
07:50 - add one more okay so this is looking
07:54 - good so far so what we can do actually
07:56 - is add one more check
08:00 - which is equality comparison and I'll
08:02 - show you what I'm doing right now so
08:04 - what we're really looking for at the end
08:06 - is did I as a response which is in this
08:08 - column right here match this response
08:11 - which is basically the right answer and
08:14 - since it's a little bit different where
08:16 - they just match exactly it's not like
08:18 - the last video where the right answer
08:20 - was ya but she could have said my name
08:22 - is a or oh yeah actually I'm referred to
08:25 - as a and they're all acceptable here
08:28 - what we can do is just check strict
08:30 - equality so equality
08:32 - comparison and we'll say uh we'll just
08:36 - say
08:36 - score actually let's say booing since
08:39 - this is going to return a Boolean and
08:42 - we're just going to compare strings and
08:44 - this is basically asking what are the
08:45 - two columns that you want to compare so
08:48 - the source is the category this is just
08:50 - the right answer and the target is the
08:53 - llm response basically what I answered
08:56 - so I'm just going to save this and now
08:58 - all this is going to do is check if
09:00 - these two values from the category and
09:02 - llm response are equal if so it's going
09:04 - to say true and of course this means
09:06 - that I got all of these right so far so
09:09 - now I'm just going to go ahead and run
09:11 - the full
09:12 - batch and that's just going to run all
09:15 - five examples instead of four so you
09:17 - know probably going to get pretty
09:19 - similar results here but there we go the
09:22 - initial cells are created now I'm going
09:24 - to give a some time to come up with her
09:27 - answers looks like she's been doing so
09:29 - far and all right there you go so it
09:32 - looks like she got a perfect score of
09:34 - 100 and yeah there you go the basics
09:38 - behind the routing architecture in llm
09:41 - application development again this just
09:43 - really helps with keeping your promp
09:45 - template small to help with not only
09:48 - maintenance of development but also to
09:51 - simplify the evaluation process as well
09:53 - so on that thank you guys for watching
09:56 - don't forget to subscribe and I'll see
09:57 - you next video
