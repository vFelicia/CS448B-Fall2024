00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer and in this tutorial we're
00:05 - going to be taking a look at primitive
00:06 - data types now what these are is pretty
00:09 - much the building blocks of all the
00:11 - programs you're going to make now I've
00:13 - broken this down into several different
00:14 - categories starting at the top we have
00:16 - primitive data types this is divided
00:18 - into three more subsections we've got
00:21 - numbers characters and
00:24 - logical now under the numbers category
00:27 - we have integers now this is all numbers
00:29 - that aren't decimals or don't have
00:31 - decimals we have bite which is a very
00:36 - small integer number that can hold a
00:38 - value uh starting at -28 all the way up
00:41 - to positive
00:42 - 127 now if you go past that what has
00:46 - happened is called overflow and you will
00:47 - get an error in your program we've got
00:50 - the short data type right here which is
00:53 - a 16bit type and it has a value that can
00:56 - span from 32,768
01:00 - all the way up to
01:03 - 32,767 now we have the int type for the
01:07 - integers now this is the type that we're
01:09 - going to be using most of the time most
01:10 - of the time in our tutorials because we
01:13 - don't need to use bite or
01:14 - short um pretty much because we don't
01:17 - have to conserve resources we're not
01:19 - making programs that are so big that we
01:20 - need to use these to conserve the pro to
01:23 - conserve the resources and an INT is
01:26 - just big enough for us to use and um we
01:29 - won't ever go outside the Realms of that
01:32 - and an INT data type is 32bit and it can
01:37 - have a minimum value of -2
01:39 - b147
01:47 - 483,000 I mean 2 billion 147 milon
01:51 - 483,000
02:00 - much self-explanatory it's a long
02:01 - integer it's a 64bit uh type and it can
02:06 - have a maximum value of uh let's see
02:12 - nine this is nine uh what comes out to
02:16 - trillion hold on
02:19 - here now the maximum value of a long is
02:23 - 9 quintillion 223 quadrillion 372
02:27 - trillion 36 billion 854
02:32 - m775
02:33 - 187 and the minimum value of that is
02:37 - pretty much that negative but instead of
02:39 - ending with 808 it I 807 it ends with
02:43 - 808 now there are other data types in
02:46 - Visual Basic that I'm not going to cover
02:48 - in this such as big integer which is
02:50 - something that has been added in The NET
02:52 - Framework 4.0 and from what I read about
02:54 - it um it does not have a limit so um
02:59 - feel free to play around with that if
03:01 - you can find some places online that
03:03 - will show you how to use that and now
03:05 - moving on we have real numbers now what
03:07 - real numbers are is um anything that can
03:09 - hold a decimal value now we have double
03:12 - and Float now double is a 64bit uh data
03:16 - type and it can hold let's
03:20 - see um it's a 754 floating
03:25 - Point uh which may not mean much to you
03:27 - but what that basically means is that it
03:30 - can hold a really long decimal and a
03:33 - float is a variant of the double it's uh
03:36 - quite similar and now moving on to
03:38 - characters we have what's called a
03:40 - character which holds one character such
03:43 - as the letter A or the letter t or G it
03:46 - just holds one of those and now one
03:49 - thing I added in the list that isn't
03:50 - technically a primitive data type but um
03:53 - I thought that I should teach you guys
03:55 - this in in this tutorial is a string now
03:57 - it's pretty much a bunch of characters
03:59 - put together you saw this in the Hello
04:00 - World tutorial
04:02 - it's enclosed in two quotes and it can
04:06 - hold as many uh characters as you want
04:09 - and spaces and other stuff and now last
04:12 - but not least we have logical now under
04:14 - logical we have Bine and Bine is a data
04:17 - type that can hold a value of true or
04:19 - false now you'll find this very useful
04:22 - when you start making programs so um
04:24 - take a look at this chart um make sure
04:26 - you remember all of this we're going to
04:27 - be working with these data types coming
04:29 - up in the next tutorials um stay tuned
04:31 - for the next one and don't forget to
