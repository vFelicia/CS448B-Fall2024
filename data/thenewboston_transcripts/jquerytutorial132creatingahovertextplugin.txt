00:02 - I'm gonna go ahead and change this to
00:04 - mouse over just to see if that makes any
00:07 - difference
00:07 - oh yeah we have we've got that okay so
00:13 - let's try this yeah okay right okay so
00:17 - let me just explain how I fixed that and
00:19 - then I'll tell you how stupid I am so
00:22 - we've got focus in here we'll change
00:25 - this to mouse over which I guess is a
00:27 - better event handler for this here focus
00:31 - in would be for something like a text
00:34 - field or a text area you know sort of
00:38 - anything like that that we focus in
00:40 - either by clicking on or tabbing to
00:42 - mouse over is obviously we using our
00:45 - mouse and we're going over an element
00:47 - the other thing I didn't do is I set
00:50 - well we'll see with just changing mouse
00:52 - over we don't have any div displayed and
00:56 - this is because using var here this
00:59 - title variable is belongs to this
01:01 - function here and when we apply it in
01:04 - title in another function it's not
01:07 - globally available so by removing the
01:09 - var we just have this title equals
01:11 - something which means it's globally
01:13 - available to be used here so when we
01:16 - refresh is you know available and it's a
01:20 - happily working again so yeah that was a
01:23 - bit long-winded and we had a couple of
01:25 - problems with obviously dealing with the
01:27 - code and I moved things around and
01:29 - changed things around but you know it
01:31 - goes to show that you've probably got
01:33 - annoyed you know some of you might be
01:36 - shouting at the screen but eventually we
01:38 - fixed it and it's just goes to show that
01:40 - fiddling with things and and thinking
01:42 - logically which I'm obviously not you
01:44 - know just goes to help so essentially
01:47 - now that we've created our plugin that's
01:49 - it you know we've we've outlined our
01:51 - plugin and we've used this and etc etc
01:54 - etc we could go on to for example change
01:58 - some kind of setting
02:01 - I'm not going to go too much into
02:03 - defining session settings of you know
02:06 - normally but what happens if we want to
02:09 - create a say boolean parameter which you
02:12 - would fade in effect or not fade in so
02:16 - we could supply say true to fade in or
02:19 - folks not to fade in or just not supply
02:21 - it at all so inside of here what we want
02:24 - to do is we want to take a parameter and
02:27 - our function so we could say for example
02:30 - fade and what we could do is we could go
02:33 - ahead and instead of using show here we
02:35 - could get rid of that and we could
02:38 - create an if statement which would
02:39 - supply so for example if fade equals
02:42 - equals true then we would want to say
02:47 - hash hover text dot fade in and then we
02:52 - could fade it in say fast or something
02:56 - otherwise we could go ahead and say hash
03:03 - hover text dot
03:07 - so so now what's happening is we're
03:10 - allowing the user to sort of submit this
03:13 - parameter foot fade which he that can
03:15 - either true or false if it is equal to
03:17 - true then we fade in otherwise we could
03:20 - say if fade is equal to false then show
03:24 - or fade equals equals undefined so fade
03:31 - equals undefined would be to not supply
03:33 - it we could say false
03:35 - anyway and that would mean that we don't
03:37 - fade in so let's just try it out first
03:39 - of all with nothing in here its refresh
03:41 - and hover over and something's gone
03:44 - wrong once again let's just double check
03:46 - there fade is equal to true oh no sorry
03:53 - I've supplied this in the completely
03:55 - wrong place no I haven't so function
03:59 - fade fade it was it was true maybe we do
04:04 - need to supply in here so lots of things
04:06 - are going wrong no not at all let's just
04:11 - go back to plug in and let's double
04:13 - check this stopped fading don't show oh
04:15 - sorry
04:17 - else if okay right so you can really
04:19 - shout at the screen now okay so now
04:21 - we've just got our normal showing you
04:24 - know no animation going on if I was to
04:26 - change the to false we would also
04:28 - obviously get the same effect where
04:29 - nothing nothing fades in but if we
04:32 - change this to true the promise that
04:35 - we've taken which is fade is obviously
04:37 - set to true now so we fade in fast
04:39 - rather than just showing so when we
04:42 - refresh we actually just you can see if
04:44 - sort of fading in so it looks a bit
04:45 - nicer so that's an example of just basic
04:48 - parameter passing or argument passing
04:51 - inside of your plug-in there are much
04:54 - more advanced technique so go ahead to
04:56 - the jQuery documentation and have a look
04:59 - at how you would pass you know more
05:02 - advanced option option variables to your
05:05 - plugin but for now that's just a simple
05:07 - plugin we've spent you know longer than
05:09 - we should have probably debugging it but
05:11 - then again that's just life it does
05:13 - actually happen so I hope you enjoyed
05:15 - creating this kind of plugin
05:18 - go ahead and feel free to start making
05:19 - your own plugins it's quite fun and I
05:23 - hope that that you know sort of helped
05:26 - you with the fact that I couldn't
05:28 - actually write the code out and I was
05:30 - you know messing around a bit but there
05:33 - we go that's that's it but yeah your
05:35 - first plugin or you know something
05:37 - that's a bit more advanced than you
05:38 - might usually create but nevertheless it
05:40 - works and it's
