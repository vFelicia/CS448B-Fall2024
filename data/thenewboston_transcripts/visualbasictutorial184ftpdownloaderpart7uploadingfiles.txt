00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer from the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to continue
00:07 - working on our uh FTP downloader now you
00:11 - may have been thinking to yourself that
00:13 - well what if they put in a an invalid
00:16 - server so let's say this is invalid when
00:19 - I click save server settings you can see
00:23 - um that if I click home directory it's
00:27 - going to try and connect to that and you
00:29 - may think it's going to freeze and crash
00:30 - but you can see that our FTP client um
00:35 - VB class library has this built into it
00:38 - so so that if it can not connect to the
00:40 - FTP server it's going to show them a
00:42 - message box saying uh that it could not
00:44 - be resolved so it could not connect now
00:46 - this is something that makes our lives a
00:48 - whole lot easier um when we're building
00:51 - this program because it checks for us
00:52 - automatically and already has a
00:55 - exception handling in it so uh thanks to
00:59 - Howard Richards for that so now let's go
01:02 - ahead and allow the user to upload a
01:05 - file so we'll access the click event for
01:08 - upload and what we need to do is create
01:11 - an open file
01:13 - dialogue so we'll go ahead and get rid
01:16 - of this and what we need to do is come
01:18 - into our designer come over to our
01:20 - toolbox and scroll down to
01:24 - dialogues so we'll open up an or we'll
01:28 - add an open file dialogue
01:31 - and we'll just call
01:33 - this open file to
01:38 - upload just hit enter
01:42 - there and looks like we put that in the
01:45 - wrong field that needs to go in the
01:48 - name so now what we need to do is we'll
01:52 - do
01:53 - declare path name as
01:57 - string and then we'll do
02:00 - file name as
02:03 - string and let's go ahead and
02:06 - type open file to upload. tile and we'll
02:10 - say that equal to please
02:13 - select a file to
02:18 - upload okay so now I'll type
02:25 - if open file to
02:28 - upload do show.
02:31 - dialog is equal to
02:35 - Windows or let's
02:38 - see forms let's
02:41 - see windows. forms. dialog result.
02:47 - okay so if the dialogue result is equal
02:51 - to okay then what do we want to do well
02:54 - we're going to
02:56 - set path
02:57 - name is going to be equal
03:01 - to open file to
03:07 - upload dot file name so this is going to
03:12 - get the whole directory of the
03:14 - file so now what we need to do is get
03:18 - the file name now this is where it gets
03:20 - a little bit tricky so file name is
03:23 - going to be equal
03:24 - to string or we need to get a substring
03:29 - of the the path name so we'll
03:33 - do path name.
03:37 - substring and we're going to have to
03:40 - give it a start
03:42 - index so what we're going to do is type
03:46 - path file or not path
03:49 - file path
03:51 - name. last index
03:54 - of so it says reports the index position
03:57 - of the last occurrence of a specified
03:59 - character within this instance so the
04:01 - last occurrence
04:06 - of I believe it's going to be a backs
04:09 - slash so at the last index of
04:13 - this we just want to add one so what
04:17 - this is going to do is it's going to set
04:18 - file name equal to a substring of path
04:21 - name and this substring is going to
04:23 - start at the last occurrence of the
04:26 - backs slash and we add one to that um
04:29 - just so it'll start on the first
04:31 - character so let's say we've got a whole
04:33 - long directory like C Callum back SL
04:35 - doents back SL hello. text what this is
04:39 - going to do it's going to start at the
04:40 - last index of this so let's say the last
04:43 - index is 15 it's going to add one and so
04:46 - it'll start at 16 and it'll take all the
04:48 - characters after that which will get us
04:50 - the file name so now what we need to do
04:53 - is we need to upload that file so let's
04:55 - just go ahead and enclose it in a try
04:58 - catch statement in case any errors
05:00 - happen so we will call FTP downloader do
05:05 - upload and the local file name is going
05:08 - to be equal to path name and the target
05:12 - file name is going to be equal to file
05:16 - name and then let's see
05:20 - here we'll go ahead and catch this
05:22 - exception so messagebox doow ex. message
05:28 - so the reason we're doing a TR catch is
05:29 - because we might get a network error and
05:32 - also these might be set to null so let's
05:35 - go ahead and minimize out of that now I
05:37 - know this part right here can be a
05:39 - little confusing but if you play around
05:41 - with this and see uh changing changing
05:44 - the last index of this um or if you go
05:46 - back to the substrings tutorials um and
05:48 - you look at this you will be able to
05:50 - figure it out um and see what's going on
05:53 - so we go ahead and run
05:56 - this so go ahead and click upload
06:00 - and let's just go to my
06:03 - desktop and let's
06:05 - add
06:06 - a let's just upload popey to the FTP
06:11 - server so we'll click
06:13 - open and it's going to open up that um
06:18 - file and it's going to upload it to the
06:20 - server now you can see that nothing's
06:21 - showing up right here so what we need to
06:23 - do whenever they upload we're going to
06:26 - need to refresh the list
06:32 - now we'll go ahead and run
06:35 - this let's go ahead and go to the home
06:38 - directory and you can see here that we
06:40 - have popeye. jpeg now I'll show you this
06:44 - by uploading another one and you can see
06:47 - here the title is please select a file
06:48 - to upload which is what we um selected
06:51 - so we'll upload a villain so we upload
06:54 - the villain and you can see it will
06:56 - update the list box and it adds villain
06:59 - cartoon. JPEG to it so go ahead add this
07:03 - code in to upload a file and once you've
07:06 - done that if you understand it move on
07:07 - to the next tutorial
