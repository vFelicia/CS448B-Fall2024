00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:02 - and this is a video tutorial for the new
00:04 - Boston in this tutorial we're going to
00:07 - look at adding classes to elements with
00:09 - JA jQuery sorry classes as you might
00:14 - know it for example in style dot CSS
00:17 - we've included this in our index dot PHP
00:19 - page just up here so we have a style
00:21 - sheet applied to the page a class would
00:24 - be something like docked bold and then
00:28 - you could create inside of this
00:31 - font-weight:bold so bold is now a class
00:35 - and we can apply this to particular
00:37 - elements for example if we were to come
00:39 - down and create a paragraph here and
00:42 - type some text and in here we could say
00:46 - class equals bold now when we refresh
00:50 - our page the text is automatically bold
00:53 - so in HTML we can use the class
00:56 - attribute to apply classes to a
00:59 - particular element however in jQuery we
01:02 - can also do this using add class so
01:04 - let's go ahead and keep this paragraph
01:06 - and just type this is some text I'm
01:09 - going to give an ID to this paragraph so
01:12 - that's just going to be some text and
01:15 - we're going to create a button which
01:19 - will actually apply the a particular
01:22 - class to this paragraph so we're going
01:25 - to apply a class to this some text
01:27 - paragraph so let's go ahead and create
01:30 - another paragraph up here with an input
01:32 - button inside this is going to be a
01:35 - button sorry the value we could say
01:38 - apply
01:41 - class and we're also gonna give the this
01:44 - button an ID so we can check for when it
01:46 - has been pressed so I'm just gonna call
01:48 - this button so when we press this button
01:51 - let's just preview it in our browser we
01:53 - want to apply the bold class to this
01:55 - text here so let's go ahead and create
01:58 - an external javascript file that will
02:00 - allow us to do this so I'm going to
02:02 - create a file inside of j/s folder and
02:06 - I'm gonna call this class J s because
02:08 - the next few tutorials will also be on
02:11 - classes so we're gonna be using this
02:12 - same class file okay so now we are
02:15 - inside class J s we can actually apply
02:19 - this bold class to this paragraph here
02:22 - to make the text bold so the first thing
02:25 - we want to do is listen out for a button
02:27 - click so the button is called button we
02:29 - reference this with a hash we say dot
02:32 - click this is a this is the click event
02:35 - handler and then inside we create a
02:38 - function we bring that down and we can
02:40 - start writing our code in there okay so
02:43 - now that we've done that we can use the
02:45 - add class functionality to actually add
02:47 - this class found in style dot CSS to our
02:50 - paragraph so our paragraph is called
02:53 - some text so we can go ahead and
02:55 - reference that as some text then we want
02:59 - to say dot add class remember the
03:02 - capital C and then in brackets the name
03:04 - of the class so the name of our class in
03:07 - this case is bold you won't need the
03:09 - dart so you just need bold ok so when we
03:13 - press the button will apply the class
03:14 - bold to this some text paragraph and
03:17 - once we've checked out in the browser
03:19 - I'm going to go ahead and tell you why
03:21 - you might actually need to do this so
03:24 - when we click apply class nothing
03:26 - happens
03:27 - ok that's because we haven't actually
03:29 - included this class dot J's file in our
03:32 - page so let's go ahead and type that out
03:34 - now script type source
03:38 - and end the script and the type is text
03:42 - forward slash JavaScript and the source
03:45 - is je s forward slash class dot J ass
03:48 - okay so let's go back to our browser and
03:50 - preview this press the button and that
03:52 - clap that particular class is applied to
03:55 - this text okay so why might you need to
03:58 - do this well let's just say you are
04:01 - validating a form and you had a
04:04 - particular element for example a and
04:07 - input text box or just you know some
04:10 - text next to it or a label you might
04:14 - want to apply a class through validation
04:16 - for example when we click on the submit
04:19 - button or register button whatever your
04:21 - form is doing we might want to make the
04:24 - text bold for fields that have perhaps
04:26 - an error so instead of replacing the
04:28 - text itself and making everything look
04:31 - messy we can just simply apply a
04:33 - predefined class to an element on our
04:35 - page so form validation is one way this
04:38 - can be used however there are obviously
04:40 - a variety of ways that you can use the
04:43 - add class functionality
