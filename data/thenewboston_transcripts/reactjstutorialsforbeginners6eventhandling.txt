00:00 - all righty hostes welcome back and in
00:02 - this video I am going to show you guys
00:04 - how to use event handling with react so
00:08 - say that you had this component and your
00:09 - component had some buttons on it of
00:11 - course whenever the user clicked one of
00:13 - those buttons you would want to be able
00:14 - to handle that event or in other words
00:16 - just do something depending on what the
00:18 - button said so that's what I'm going to
00:21 - be showing you guys how to do AKA event
00:23 - handling so in the upcoming tutorials
00:26 - I'm going to start making a very simple
00:28 - app to kind of demonstrate a bunch of
00:29 - stuff
00:30 - and I think it's a little bit easier to
00:31 - see how all of these you know concepts
00:34 - are put together in a simple project
00:35 - instead of just showing you guys a bunch
00:37 - of weird demos so what I'm going to be
00:40 - doing is I'm going to be making kind of
00:42 - a sticky note app where the user can add
00:44 - new notes or delete or edit notes and I
00:48 - don't know they can write whatever notes
00:50 - they want like walk the dog um have a
00:53 - note for their favorite movies just
00:54 - pretty much a bunch of comments that
00:56 - they can edit delete I don't know it's
00:59 - the first thing that popped up in my
01:00 - head so let's go ahead and make a new
01:03 - component and I'll name it comment now
01:05 - all this is going to be is essentially a
01:08 - block that's going to have some text on
01:10 - it depending on whatever your comment is
01:12 - and we'll have a button for editing it
01:14 - and another button for deleting it so
01:17 - very simple
01:19 - so
01:21 - react create
01:25 - class all right so of course the very
01:28 - first thing I do whenever I make a
01:30 - component is no matter how many
01:31 - different features I want to add to it
01:33 - no matter how interactive it's going to
01:35 - be I just go ahead and I make the plane
01:38 - HTML and then I just add dummy data so
01:41 - maybe this is a component that has a
01:42 - photo that changes all the time well
01:44 - when I first make it I'm just going to
01:46 - put in some image um just some static
01:49 - image just to make sure that it works
01:51 - and is displayed how I want it to so for
01:54 - render remember this is just going to be
01:56 - equal to a function and it's just going
01:58 - to return some HTML
02:01 - so I actually have a bunch of the CSS
02:03 - already styled so you can style this
02:05 - however you want um you know this isn't
02:07 - really a CSS tutorial but if you want
02:09 - the same styling as me then go ahead in
02:12 - the first video um get that repo
02:14 - downloaded and the CSS file is right
02:17 - here so there you go but again if you
02:19 - don't have the CSS then just style it
02:21 - however you want it to look so this
02:24 - entire thing is going to be in a
02:26 - div and I already made a style called
02:29 - comment container so for the class name
02:33 - you set this equal to comment container
02:35 - just like that now that brings me to
02:37 - another point and that is this right
02:39 - here you can add um attributes just like
02:42 - you would in normal HTML using jsx
02:46 - however the reason that we can't write
02:47 - class right here is because class is
02:50 - already a reserved keyword in JavaScript
02:53 - a JavaScript class actually means
02:55 - something so that's why in jsx we have
02:58 - to write class name
03:00 - so most of your other attributes are
03:01 - going to be fine just write normal HTML
03:04 - but sometimes if they clash with
03:05 - JavaScript then that's what jsx did and
03:07 - I'll keep a heads up in case I come
03:09 - across it again but anyways inside this
03:12 - comment what we're going to have is
03:14 - basically a div and two buttons so the
03:18 - div is just going to be the
03:20 - text um of
03:25 - whatever whatever and two
03:28 - buttons
03:32 - all right so this first button is just
03:33 - going to be for editing the comment and
03:35 - this second one is just going to be for
03:37 - deleting actually let me just go ahead
03:39 - and name that remove all right now I
03:42 - already styled these as well so the text
03:45 - it actually has a class name
03:47 - of pretty creative wait till you hear it
03:50 - comment text and all the styling does is
03:53 - it makes it a little bit bold and it
03:55 - adds some spacing between the text and
03:57 - the
03:58 - buttons that's all and um these button
04:03 - classes I already uh styled these as
04:05 - well so I made a class called button
04:07 - primary which is blue and another
04:11 - one that is red called button danger so
04:15 - now our edit button is blue and our
04:18 - remove button is red I thought that was
04:20 - kind of appropriate all right so what we
04:23 - want to happen is whenever the user
04:25 - clicks these buttons then something
04:28 - happens so before we can add an onclick
04:31 - attribute we actually need to make
04:33 - functions because essentially we're
04:35 - going to say whenever you click this
04:37 - call a function in this component now we
04:40 - already have this function right here
04:42 - called render and this is a function uh
04:45 - responsible for drawing or displaying
04:48 - some HTML but we can actually make our
04:50 - own custom functions and name them
04:51 - whatever we want so I'm going to make
04:54 - one called edit and again this is just
04:56 - equal to a function now this can do
04:59 - whatever we want um we can log something
05:03 - out on the screen we can just make some
05:06 - alert pop up and for right now keep
05:08 - things simple we'll just make an alert
05:09 - popup that says editing
05:12 - comment now we're going to make another
05:14 - function and eventually um whenever we
05:17 - call these functions we're going to be
05:19 - able to edit the comment and it's
05:20 - actually going to delete it but for
05:22 - right now I'll just say
05:26 - remove we'll just make an alert pop up
05:29 - to show you guys that hey you can
05:31 - actually have event handling with your
05:33 - components so right now we have these
05:35 - cool functions an edit function and a
05:38 - remove function and whenever you call
05:40 - them they display a popup that says
05:43 - editing or removing comment but we
05:46 - didn't link these buttons to these
05:48 - functions in any kind of way so how do
05:51 - we do that how do we say whenever we
05:52 - click this button to call this function
05:54 - or this function well what you do is you
05:56 - actually add another onclick attribute
06:00 - now this is going to be equal to this
06:05 - function so whenever we click edit it's
06:07 - going to call
06:09 - onclick call this function so how do you
06:12 - do that well since this is a function
06:15 - from the same class we just need to
06:17 - write this and then a DOT separator and
06:20 - then the function name so whenever we
06:22 - click the edit button just call this
06:25 - classes or components edit function just
06:29 - like that now the same thing with the
06:32 - remove whenever you click the on or
06:35 - remove button just go ahead and call
06:37 - this components
06:40 - remove function or method I guess it's
06:43 - more technically called so there you go
06:47 - and now we actually need to render this
06:50 - so let me clean this up so it's noce and
06:53 - neat for future
06:55 - tutorials all right so I'm taking all
06:57 - these comments and I'm surrounding them
06:59 - them inside a board and all this board
07:01 - is is some styling to give it a nice
07:03 - light blue background as you guys can
07:04 - see right here so whenever I want to
07:07 - make a new comment then all I have to
07:10 - write is comment just like that
07:15 - and let right hey now and check this out
07:19 - so whenever I refresh
07:20 - this we can actually test these right
07:22 - now if I click edit we get our alert
07:25 - popping up whenever I click remove we
07:27 - get our another alert popping up so we
07:29 - know that our event handlers they are
07:32 - working properly but again like I said
07:35 - one thing I want to do from here is
07:37 - instead of just having the static text
07:41 - just like this I actually want to take
07:43 - whatever text is in between these
07:45 - comment tags and I want to display that
07:47 - for the comment so let me just write uh
07:51 - something
07:52 - like I'll just write uh hey my name is
07:58 - Bucky for one comment and then for
08:01 - another one I'll write a beans something
08:05 - stupid and then for another one I'll
08:06 - write tuna just so we have three
08:09 - different comments so right now whenever
08:11 - I refresh this and take a look at my
08:13 - application all of these comments are
08:15 - the same because we just said display
08:17 - text we didn't say do anything with this
08:20 - so how do we access the data in between
08:23 - these tags so we can actually use it in
08:26 - our component well this is actually a
08:29 - built-in property called children so
08:32 - again the children property is just any
08:35 - data that's in between the opening tag
08:37 - and closing tag so remember that I said
08:40 - in like two tutorials ago whenever you
08:42 - want to use properties you just use this
08:44 - props and then the name of the property
08:47 - and this
08:48 - one is just children so whenever I
08:51 - refresh this check it out it gets
08:55 - whatever is in between these tags which
08:57 - are the children which is just static
08:59 - text in this example and for each
09:03 - component render it displays it in
09:06 - between this div tag so I know I threw a
09:10 - lot at you guys but again what we
09:12 - covered in this video is first of all
09:13 - event handling now event and handling I
09:16 - can't even talk right now is how you can
09:19 - pretty much make custom functions in
09:21 - your component and you can call those
09:24 - with on click and there are other event
09:25 - handlers as well but on click is the
09:27 - most famous one and also whenever you
09:30 - want to pass data in between these tags
09:34 - you can access it through the children
09:37 - property so pretty cool eh and yeah I
09:40 - think that's it that's enough info for
09:42 - this lesson so thank you guys for
09:43 - watching I will see you guys next time
