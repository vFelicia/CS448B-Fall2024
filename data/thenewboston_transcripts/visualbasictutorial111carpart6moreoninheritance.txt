00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the New Boston
00:05 - in this tutorial we're gonna be looking
00:07 - more at the car program now if you
00:10 - remember from the last tutorial we
00:11 - looked at inheritance and we're gonna be
00:13 - focusing mostly on inheritance in this
00:15 - tutorial and if none of this makes any
00:17 - sense to you and you don't know what
00:19 - code is on my screen right now then you
00:20 - might want to go back and start from the
00:22 - beginning of the car series so if you
00:27 - remember we created this sports car that
00:29 - inherits from car and we added weight
00:31 - and get sports info so everything that
00:34 - we can use in car we can use in our
00:38 - sports car so let's come over here to
00:41 - form on BB and you can see here we've
00:44 - got show car info now we can show the
00:47 - sports info or we can also just do two
00:52 - string and now let's go ahead and run
00:55 - this and see what kind of output we get
00:58 - so we get show info info info we get the
01:02 - car name which is nothing the color red
01:04 - the number of doors is five and the
01:07 - speed is zero now this is exactly the
01:11 - same as it is in the car class you can
01:16 - see that we have overridden the two
01:19 - string function and how did have we have
01:22 - it output the name the color and the
01:25 - number of doors and it will work with
01:28 - any other class that inherits from car
01:30 - now we can also access any of these
01:33 - other methods and functions so let's go
01:36 - ahead and do that we'll go ahead and
01:38 - change this back to dot show let's do
01:44 - what was it called
01:47 - the get sports car info
01:51 - or get sports info okay so now will we
01:56 - have them set the name of the car let's
01:59 - just go ahead and use default sports car
02:03 - now we could change this I mean not
02:07 - change this we could put these into
02:08 - other methods so that we don't have to
02:11 - continues to change the code we can just
02:12 - change the arguments send something else
02:15 - to the arguments and we'll do that later
02:17 - on but for now we're gonna be focusing
02:19 - on inheritance so the evil sports car
02:22 - car name and it's going to enter the
02:25 - name of the car and that is a public
02:28 - variable the car name so that we can
02:32 - access it directly and we don't have to
02:33 - make a property for it we could set the
02:36 - color too so let's do default sports car
02:41 - dot color and it will store the color
02:45 - and that in color is a public variable
02:47 - I'll skip the show info and we'll do
02:50 - default sports car dot number of doors
02:54 - and the number of doors is a property I
02:59 - think yeah right here we've got the
03:02 - number of doors property and just sends
03:04 - back the end number of doors which is a
03:07 - private variable so go ahead and
03:10 - collapse that and we've got default
03:12 - sports car dot number of doors and then
03:15 - we get whatever they type in and convert
03:17 - it to an integer so we'll go ahead and
03:21 - minimize that and we've got accelerate
03:24 - so we'll just change that to be false
03:28 - sports car dot accelerate and I don't
03:32 - know why we have that right there but
03:35 - let's go ahead and minimize that so now
03:38 - let's go ahead and run this and see what
03:40 - we get if it compiles successfully we've
03:43 - got our normal form we can set the name
03:46 - of it so for our sports car let's do a
03:50 - Camaro SS go ahead and click OK we'll
03:54 - set the color to let's say orange
04:00 - it okay their doors obviously - and
04:04 - let's accelerate it by let's do a 140
04:07 - miles per hour and then we will show the
04:11 - info so we've got our Camaro SS our
04:15 - color orange we've got two doors the
04:17 - speed is 140 miles per hour we got 500
04:20 - horsepower and the weight is 1,000
04:23 - pounds and now we didn't even have to
04:26 - write any code for our sports car class
04:29 - because it's all inherited from car now
04:34 - let's go ahead and show car info we'll
04:36 - just do two string here and see what
04:39 - kind of output we get from doing the
04:42 - same thing so go ahead and run this so
04:46 - the name - Camaro SS click OK set the
04:51 - color to orange set the doors to two
04:55 - will accelerate it to a hundred and
04:58 - fifty miles per hour and then we'll show
05:00 - the info we get the Camaro SS orange
05:03 - color two doors and the speed of the car
05:05 - and two string is pretty much the
05:09 - showing the default stuff of the car
05:10 - that every car would have so the speed
05:15 - the doors and the color and the name and
05:17 - every car has a horsepower and a weight
05:21 - but for sports cars that is particularly
05:23 - important it wouldn't be important for
05:26 - say a minivan so we'll just go ahead and
05:28 - click OK so if you haven't typed in this
05:31 - code already go ahead and do that and
05:33 - then once you understand this and you're
05:35 - starting to understand inheritance go
05:38 - ahead and move on for the next tutorial
05:40 - and we're gonna be working more on the
05:41 - car program
