00:02 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:04 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:07 - this tutorial we're going to be taking
00:08 - another look at enumerations now sorry
00:11 - I've been jumping around a bit in these
00:12 - last couple tutorials but um I'm just
00:16 - trying to hit the uh most import
00:17 - important points and sometimes I feel
00:19 - you need to learn uh maybe something
00:21 - about enumerations after you learn about
00:23 - properties and when we make those demo
00:25 - applications so um all that aside what
00:28 - we're going to do is we're going to be
00:30 - passing an a numeration to a sub or a
00:34 - function so let's go ahead and create a
00:37 - new
00:38 - project we will select a Windows forms
00:41 - application and we will call
00:44 - it passing en
00:47 - nums okay so we'll wait for that to load
00:50 - and we will go ahead and Shrink this
00:53 - down a
00:55 - bit and we
00:57 - will select the
01:01 - toolbx we will add a combo box right
01:05 - here uh let's see right there and we
01:08 - will add a button so here's our combo
01:13 - box and we'll add a button okay so now
01:16 - we'll shrink this down some close out of
01:18 - the
01:19 - toolbox and we will make the button a
01:21 - little bit bigger so we will set the
01:24 - name of combo box one to combo
01:28 - Sports and we'll go ahead and set the
01:30 - button name to button analyze and we'll
01:34 - set the text
01:37 - to analyze
01:40 - sport so in our combo box we're going to
01:43 - go ahead and come over here to the
01:45 - collections uh property so here's items
01:49 - and we need our we need to add stuff to
01:51 - the collection so we'll just add
01:55 - baseball
01:57 - basketball and football
02:00 - and we'll go ahead and click okay so now
02:03 - we will go ahead and create an event
02:05 - handler for analyze Sport and we'll just
02:08 - let that sit there for now and let's go
02:10 - ahead and zoom in and create an
02:12 - enumeration so
02:15 - private enam
02:19 - Sports and now what we're going to
02:23 - do is set the data type for that so
02:26 - private inom Sports
02:28 - as uh let's is to
02:31 - integer okay so now what we're going to
02:32 - do is we're going to
02:34 - set baseball equal
02:38 - 1 basketball equals
02:41 - 2 and
02:45 - football equals 3 so now we're just
02:48 - going to create an object of this
02:50 - enumeration now object probably isn't
02:52 - the best word for that let's create a
02:54 - variable a data type of this enumeration
02:57 - so we'll just type private my
03:00 - Sport AS Sports and now what we're going
03:04 - to do is we're going to come over here
03:05 - and create an event so you can see that
03:08 - the uh default event handler is the
03:11 - selected index changed um now you can
03:14 - come over here to the lightning bolt and
03:16 - change it and um you can uh select which
03:19 - one you want but we're just going to use
03:21 - selected index change so now what we're
03:23 - going to do is we're going to
03:26 - type my sport
03:32 - equals combos
03:35 - Sports Dot and now let's go back here
03:38 - and we can look at our collection for
03:41 - combo Sports we got baseball basketball
03:43 - and football so let just go ahead and
03:45 - click cancel there and you can see that
03:47 - we have uh the same Valu set in here now
03:51 - let's start from Counting from zero cuz
03:54 - it's always good to count from zeros in
03:55 - programs because that's how computers
03:56 - work they start counting from zero so my
03:59 - sport equal combos sports. selected
04:03 - index now the selected index for combo
04:06 - Sports starts at zero which is going to
04:07 - be baseball um the
04:12 - uh then the next one up would be one and
04:15 - the next one after that would be two now
04:17 - if no uh no item in the combo box is
04:20 - selected it's going to be equal to
04:21 - negative 1 so what we can do to uh
04:24 - handle any errors that might happen
04:26 - we'll just type if
04:30 - combos
04:32 - sports. selected index does not equal
04:37 - -1 then go ahead and do this so we'll
04:41 - just cut that out right there and paste
04:44 - it in okay so now that we've got which
04:49 - sport they collected what we want to do
04:51 - is we want to analyze the sport when
04:53 - they click analyze the sport so um we'll
04:56 - just create a sub that will do that for
04:58 - us so so we'll go ahead and come down
05:01 - here below combo Sports and we will type
05:03 - private
05:05 - sub analyze
05:08 - Sport and we will just go ahead
05:11 - and
05:14 - byal sports
05:18 - list as
05:21 - Sports so basically we're passing a an
05:25 - object of the sports data type which is
05:28 - an an enumer a so now we're just going
05:31 - to use a select case statement
05:34 - so select case and we're just going to
05:38 - go through
05:41 - sport sports
05:43 - list so we will type
05:47 - case
05:51 - um so case is and now what we can do is
05:57 - we can check to see if it any one of the
06:00 - values in our Sports enumeration so the
06:03 - way we would do this
06:05 - is
06:07 - sports
06:08 - do
06:14 - baseball let's try this again
06:18 - sports.
06:20 - baseball and we need to add an equals
06:23 - right here that's what I was missing
06:25 - okay so case is Sport equals sports.
06:29 - baseball so if the sports list that they
06:31 - pass to it is equal to baseball then
06:34 - we'll go ahead and type messagebox
06:38 - doow your sport is
06:42 - baseball and now I'll do case is equal
06:47 - to sports.
06:51 - foot we don't want sports list we
06:55 - want
06:58 - Sports so if it's equal to sports. foot
07:01 - we will just type
07:04 - messagebox
07:07 - Dosh your sport is
07:12 - football and we'll do that one more time
07:15 - so case is equal to
07:22 - Sports sports.
07:27 - basketball and now we'll just use the
07:30 - shorthand for message box so we'll just
07:33 - type message box your sport
07:36 - is
07:39 - basketball and then we will do a case
07:43 - else so then we'll just type message
07:47 - box you don't have a
07:54 - sport okay so now if we go ahead and run
07:58 - this we've got our combo box right here
08:01 - nothing is selected so if we click
08:03 - analyze support analyze support uh
08:06 - nothing's going to happen because we
08:07 - forgot something really important when
08:09 - they click uh button analyze we want to
08:12 - call analyze Sport and then my
08:16 - sport okay so now let's go ahead and run
08:19 - this and you can see if there's nothing
08:21 - selected uh it'll
08:24 - say looks like we had a problem there uh
08:27 - let's go ahead and select baseball so so
08:29 - say your sport is baseball we select
08:31 - basketball your sport is
08:34 - basketball football your sport is
08:41 - football so um you can go ahead and try
08:45 - passing uh enumerations to uh subs and
08:48 - functions if you want and um you can
08:51 - even I'll scroll up here so you can
08:53 - pause and look at this code if you miss
08:54 - some of it put that in uh change some of
08:57 - the code do whatever you want and then
08:59 - move on to the next tutorial and thanks
09:00 - for watching
