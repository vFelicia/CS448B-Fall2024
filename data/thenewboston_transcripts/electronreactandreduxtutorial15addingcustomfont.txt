00:00 - alrighty everyone welcome back to the
00:02 - last tutorial that I'm going to be
00:04 - making for this beautiful application
00:06 - and in this one we're going to be adding
00:08 - a custom font however before you started
00:11 - just want to mention one tiny update
00:13 - that I made from the last tutorial and
00:15 - that was adding this button right here
00:17 - so I realized we didn't have a way to
00:19 - clear this history so all this button
00:22 - does whenever you click it it just
00:24 - resets everything easy peasy and again I
00:27 - didn't want to record it because yeah
00:30 - not really learning any new Concepts the
00:32 - only thing it does is just reset your
00:34 - runs to the initial state which is just
00:35 - an empty dict
00:37 - so on that note let me go ahead and
00:39 - close this and now let's go ahead and
00:41 - figure out how to add a custom font
00:44 - so in order to add a custom font the
00:46 - first thing that we need is a font so
00:48 - I'm going to go to fonts.google.com and
00:51 - I already know the font that I want it's
00:53 - the Ubuntu font right here so I'm going
00:56 - to go ahead and click in this and then
00:59 - what I'll do is down here I'm just going
01:02 - to select all of the font files that I
01:05 - want so I'm going to be using this light
01:07 - one basically all of these aside from
01:09 - the italics because we don't use italics
01:11 - anywhere in the app
01:13 - so I'll select this regular to
01:15 - and let's see
01:18 - medium and bold
01:20 - all right so now if I can view what I
01:23 - selected light regular medium and bold
01:25 - I'm just going to go ahead and click
01:27 - download all
01:30 - and that is going to give me this ZIP
01:31 - file which I can just extract right here
01:34 - because as you can see this directory
01:38 - with everything in here actually I think
01:40 - I clicked uh the wrong button there but
01:43 - either way I can just delete the italics
01:45 - right here because we don't need them
01:48 - all right so now what I'm going to do is
01:51 - just take this entire file and I'll show
01:54 - you where I'm going to stick it
01:57 - so in speed test Styles I'm going to
02:00 - create a new directory called fonts
02:03 - and then I'm just going to take this and
02:05 - drag it right here
02:08 - all right so now you see in Styles fonts
02:10 - let me go ahead and right click that
02:13 - you just add to get
02:16 - all right
02:17 - so now Styles fonts Ubuntu we have all
02:21 - our fonts as well as the license right
02:22 - here and as the next steps what I'm
02:25 - going to do is make another file right
02:27 - under Styles and this is just gonna be
02:30 - fonts.css so this is where we're going
02:33 - to be starting to Define our custom font
02:35 - and to do that we can use the font face
02:38 - rule in CSS
02:40 - and the first thing that you write is
02:43 - the font family
02:44 - so the name of this is of course Ubuntu
02:48 - and now remember let me pop back open
02:51 - that browser so each of these fonts I
02:54 - have four files
02:56 - this light or excuse me bold light
02:58 - medium and irregular and each of those
03:01 - files
03:03 - correspond to a certain font weight so
03:06 - light is 300 regular is 400 so on and so
03:09 - forth so what I'm going to do is
03:10 - basically have four of these font face
03:13 - rules and I just need to make that
03:15 - explicit correlation so font weight of
03:19 - 300 what file does this relate to and to
03:22 - Define that you write source and for
03:24 - this URL
03:27 - you pretty much just write the path to
03:29 - what was 300 this light one right here
03:32 - so from that it's fonts
03:36 - and that is in Ubuntu and let me just
03:38 - make sure I get this file type so
03:43 - and that is related to the Ubuntu Lite
03:46 - font file right here
03:48 - so now I can probably just copy this
03:51 - a couple times
03:54 - and we had uh it was 400 let me just
03:58 - make sure I got these ready so 400 500
04:01 - and 700 regular medium and bold
04:04 - so 400
04:07 - 500 and 700
04:12 - regular
04:16 - medium and bold
04:20 - all right so again this file is just
04:22 - defining custom font for us and to
04:24 - ensure that our app is able to use these
04:27 - what we can do is in containers and in
04:29 - this top level container
04:31 - speed test one where our app window is
04:33 - right under the Styles I'm just going to
04:35 - paste this import right here which is
04:38 - just importing this file so again this
04:40 - doesn't actually apply the Styles
04:42 - themselves to the app but then what we
04:45 - can do is we can have these fonts
04:47 - basically able to be applied in any of
04:49 - the components that we want so that
04:51 - being said what we could do right here
04:53 - is we could go into the Styles file and
04:56 - start writing the let me see if I have
04:59 - well basically something like this font
05:01 - family and then we could write Ubuntu
05:03 - just like that however the reason that I
05:06 - don't want to do this is because I'm
05:09 - going to go ahead and create a font
05:11 - pretty much the equivalent of like a
05:13 - font style guide and that's going to
05:15 - make sure that all of our fonts are
05:16 - standardized by using object that only
05:18 - contains the properties that are allowed
05:20 - and I know that's kind of confusing but
05:22 - I'll show you what I'm talking about
05:23 - right now so in this stylus fonts I'm
05:27 - going to go ahead and just create a new
05:28 - typescript file and I'm going to say
05:30 - index.ts now in here I want to disable
05:34 - one of the eslint rules that we have for
05:37 - sorting keys and you'll see why in just
05:39 - a second so this const is going to be
05:42 - named fonts and this is going to be
05:45 - equal to an object with all the valid
05:48 - font properties that we allow including
05:49 - the font family and font weight so
05:52 - before I do anything else let me just go
05:54 - ahead and make that my default export
05:56 - and check it out
05:57 - so for this speed test apps font family
06:03 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to say
06:05 - that there's one font family that we're
06:07 - going to be using and we'll just name it
06:09 - default and this is equal to Ubuntu
06:13 - a u b u n t u and just for a fallback
06:17 - I'll just say songs
06:19 - serif
06:21 - alright so now in our component Styles
06:24 - file instead of typing this out
06:26 - explicitly every time what we'll do is
06:28 - we'll say
06:30 - fonts.family.default and it'll give it
06:32 - the same behavior but this way whenever
06:35 - we do this if we ever go and update this
06:37 - default font family for this app we
06:39 - don't have to like update it in in a
06:41 - million files we just have to update it
06:43 - in this one location and it's
06:45 - automatically going to be applied
06:47 - so aside from the font family I also
06:49 - want to standardize my weights
06:51 - and this is just to ensure that we're
06:53 - only using those proper weights because
06:56 - we only have the weights available of
06:58 - 300 400 500 and 700
07:01 - so for this let me see what those names
07:03 - were I like to start with the most bold
07:06 - and kind of work my way down so bold
07:08 - medium regular light
07:10 - so bold and this is equal
07:13 - wow got a million people texting let me
07:16 - shut this off
07:19 - so bold
07:21 - medium regular light
07:24 - the regular one is 500
07:28 - the medium this one was 400
07:33 - and then the light one
07:35 - this one was 300.
07:38 - and again this is why I chose to disable
07:41 - the sort keys right here because I like
07:44 - to have these sorted not alphabetically
07:46 - which this would enforce but instead
07:49 - just by the weight value so again
07:51 - everywhere in our App instead of typing
07:53 - these values explicitly we're going to
07:55 - be using one of these it's just going to
07:56 - keep everything a little bit more clean
07:58 - however before that what I want to do is
08:00 - hop into this Styles index
08:03 - and I just wanna
08:05 - kind of like our standard process
08:08 - I'll just say fonts
08:12 - and I believe it was a default
08:17 - so now we can just import these from
08:19 - this Styles file and just makes this
08:21 - import a little bit cleaner so now with
08:23 - all this what we can do is probably
08:26 - don't need this anymore all right so
08:28 - speed test containers let's first go
08:30 - ahead and install our top level
08:31 - container so in addition to the scroll
08:34 - Style
08:35 - also want to be importing those fonts
08:38 - and this is font
08:41 - family and this is going to be equal to
08:43 - fonts
08:45 - Dot family dot default
08:50 - all right now since this font family is
08:54 - being applied to this top level
08:55 - container basically the wrapper for
08:58 - everything else then what should happen
09:01 - and let me go ahead and probably have to
09:02 - restart my app oh don't even have to
09:04 - restart it that's pretty cool so as you
09:07 - can see this font did indeed change I
09:09 - don't know if you can tell but this is
09:10 - now Ubuntu font actually let me go ahead
09:12 - and show you
09:14 - that's where he at
09:17 - yep right here we are now getting the
09:19 - Ubuntu fought family so it is being
09:22 - applied to most all of these components
09:24 - but I want to show you a couple unique
09:26 - things so first of all whenever we have
09:28 - a button even though this button is
09:31 - indeed inside the container of course
09:33 - then we don't have that styling and
09:37 - that's a unique thing and that's because
09:39 - this user agent style sheet which is
09:41 - just like the default electron styling
09:43 - for some reason on buttons it resets it
09:46 - and then another thing that I want to
09:48 - point out is that whenever we have a
09:50 - modal then we don't have the styling
09:53 - applied to these modals either now the
09:56 - reason that it doesn't get applied to
09:57 - modals is because remember back in the
10:01 - modal tutorial whenever we created that
10:03 - modal and I'll show you right now
10:04 - actually
10:06 - so in this components modal
10:09 - what we were doing is we were actually
10:11 - rendering it outside that entire Dom
10:13 - hierarchy and we are rendering it in
10:16 - modal root so even though we wrote the
10:18 - component and it kind of looks like in
10:20 - our source code it appears inside this
10:23 - structure right here it's actually kind
10:26 - of rendering like outside here in a way
10:28 - so that said we also need
10:32 - clean these up to explicitly apply these
10:35 - font styles to those locations as well
10:38 - so first of all for those buttons
10:40 - those were in containers top
10:44 - Styles it is this button right here
10:49 - and copy my import apps
10:53 - we don't need the scroll style what we
10:55 - are looking for is just this font family
10:57 - applied to that button
11:01 - right here
11:04 - right here is where I want it
11:05 - and then of course in our modal
11:10 - same exact thing
11:14 - so let me go ahead and copy this F speed
11:16 - test styles
11:19 - did I even make this let's pick this
11:21 - okay and then copy this fan font family
11:25 - for the modal
11:29 - modal
11:30 - s on family right here and now we may
11:34 - have to restart the app oh I guess not
11:36 - so now we can see that our modal is now
11:38 - styled it as well as our button looking
11:41 - good so now that we have the font family
11:43 - applied the only other thing that we
11:45 - need to do now is we actually close all
11:49 - these
11:50 - so in our speed test what we're going to
11:52 - do is we're just going to search for
11:54 - font weight
11:55 - and then we're going to replace these
11:58 - with our standardized font weight and
12:00 - I'll do one and then I'll pause the
12:01 - video and do the rest of them
12:03 - so all right make sure we got that
12:04 - imported
12:06 - and I'll just make sure we got the right
12:08 - one
12:09 - all right so instead of explicitly
12:12 - saying for example right here 500 we are
12:16 - going to do fonts dot weights dot
12:19 - regular
12:23 - so font style weight start regular and
12:27 - basically we can search for this just
12:29 - fontway and replace each of these so
12:32 - pause the video real quick and uh do it
12:34 - since
12:35 - probably be pretty boring to watch me do
12:37 - this
12:38 - and now you can see that each of those
12:41 - explicit fonts weights were replaced by
12:44 - one of these valid properties either
12:46 - bold light regular or medium so I'm now
12:49 - like and go ahead and close that and
12:52 - check it out
12:54 - all right looking good now let me just
12:57 - make sure I didn't break anything and
12:59 - all right pretty sweet and this exact
13:02 - pattern is well not the exact same thing
13:05 - but uh that same kind of styling system
13:08 - is how I like to style this color
13:11 - theming as well so instead of typing out
13:15 - all those colors
13:17 - see if we have it anywhere like uh right
13:19 - here what I like to do is kind of Follow
13:21 - That same pattern and this is what I did
13:23 - for the chat application you see we have
13:26 - a palette some custom background colors
13:28 - but really uh instead of like explicitly
13:31 - typing these we do palette dot blue I
13:34 - don't know why I said we it was uh I
13:36 - think I was the only one making this app
13:38 - so far but uh either way uh you can kind
13:41 - of see what we're doing from the color
13:42 - theme
13:43 - again I'll probably do this on my own I
13:45 - want to swap out all these colors in the
13:47 - speed test app with a more standardized
13:50 - color theme but I don't want to waste
13:53 - all your time if I'm not teaching
13:54 - anything new kind of feel bad when I do
13:56 - that but on that note yeah we now have
14:00 - two completed successful apps well some
14:03 - issues right here with the chat app with
14:05 - a scroll but I mean tnbos is looking I
14:10 - gotta be honest it it's going a lot
14:11 - better than I expected even though you
14:13 - know I might be the only one to ever use
14:16 - these apps I'm still having fun building
14:18 - that I think this is a cool little
14:19 - architecture so again like I said a
14:21 - couple cleanup items still for the speed
14:23 - test app but I'll probably end the
14:25 - tutorial series here if anyone else has
14:28 - any ideas for an application I could
14:30 - build let me know I'll have to build it
14:32 - looking for new ideas but otherwise
14:34 - thank you all for watching and I'll see
14:37 - you next time
