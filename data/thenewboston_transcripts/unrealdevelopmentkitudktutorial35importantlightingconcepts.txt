00:00 - what's going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - 35th tutorial in the UDK and in this
00:05 - tutorial I just want to talk to you guys
00:07 - about some very important lighting
00:09 - concepts concerning the UDK and
00:11 - concerning computer games in general so
00:13 - I'm not gonna be doing a whole lot of
00:15 - adding moving around lights doing this
00:18 - in that in this tutorial but once you
00:20 - understand this tutorial and what I have
00:22 - to teach it's gonna take your knowledge
00:24 - of lights in the UDK to a whole nother
00:26 - level so this is actually probably one
00:28 - of the most important tutorials that I
00:30 - made yet so you definitely don't want to
00:31 - miss it so basically the first thing I
00:33 - want to talk to you guys about is how
00:35 - light is calculated whenever you're
00:37 - playing the computer game so whenever
00:39 - you're playing a computer game or a
00:41 - playstation or xbox game most of the
00:43 - lighting information you see is actually
00:46 - calculated before you even start that
00:49 - game and by that I mean if all of the
00:52 - lighting information like all these
00:54 - properties were calculated as we were
00:56 - playing the game
00:56 - then it would just slaughter our
00:58 - processor in our computer would lag so
01:01 - that's why whenever you're playing a
01:02 - computer game what the UDK does is it
01:06 - makes these things called light maps and
01:08 - shadow maps for all the lights that
01:10 - don't move for example if we were to
01:12 - play this game the UDK beforehand would
01:15 - create a light map and a shadow map for
01:18 - this light right here since this light
01:20 - doesn't move it's able to pre calculate
01:23 - all the points where this light is gonna
01:25 - hit and all the spaces where this light
01:27 - is going to illuminate beforehand and
01:29 - what that does is it saves our processor
01:32 - a bunch of having to process the lights
01:34 - while our character is running around
01:36 - and you know trying to do the important
01:39 - stuff like shoot aliens and stuff so
01:41 - with that being said I told you guys
01:43 - that what the UDK does is make these
01:45 - things called light maps and shadow maps
01:47 - so I guess I better explain you guys
01:48 - what those things are a light map is
01:51 - basically a texture so let me go ahead
01:53 - and actually show you one hopefully when
01:56 - I type in light map yup we got some
01:59 - right here go ahead and select texture
02:00 - so as you can see a light map is
02:03 - basically a texture telling the UDK
02:06 - which parts of your map you want to
02:09 - light up
02:10 - so since we have these textures built
02:12 - beforehand whenever we load our game all
02:15 - the information is there it doesn't have
02:17 - to process it as our character is moving
02:19 - around so that way it basically saves
02:21 - our computer a whole bunch of work so
02:23 - that's what a white map is a shadow map
02:26 - is basically the exact same thing but
02:28 - what a shadow map would do is it would
02:30 - use a texture to tell the UDK where the
02:33 - shadows are so light map tells the UK
02:35 - where the light is gonna hit the shadow
02:37 - map tells the UK where the shadows are
02:40 - so there's our two terminologies on maps
02:43 - now another you know bit of terminology
02:46 - you're gonna come across a lot when
02:48 - you're working with the UDK is static
02:50 - lights in dynamic lights now I'm
02:52 - guessing you guys can probably figure
02:54 - out what these mean just by the sound
02:55 - civil but just to clarify because I
02:57 - don't want to skip anything a static
02:59 - light is a light that doesn't move for
03:01 - example this point light right here
03:03 - would be a static light I dynamically is
03:06 - a light that actually moves during
03:08 - gameplay so if you were to put this
03:10 - light on a moving path and you want it
03:12 - to you know move back and forth and back
03:15 - and forth during gameplay that would be
03:17 - a dynamic light so with that being said
03:19 - static lights are lights that we can
03:22 - make a light maps out of those are
03:23 - lights that are pre calculated and it
03:26 - makes it really easy on our computers
03:28 - processor to have static lights so
03:31 - whenever you're creating level keep that
03:32 - in mind a bunch of static lights make it
03:34 - really easy on your computer dynamic
03:36 - lights however aka the lights that move
03:38 - they can't be pre calculated so they
03:41 - actually need to be calculated during
03:42 - gameplay and this takes a lot of
03:44 - processing power from your computer so
03:46 - whenever you're making a computer game
03:48 - keep that in mind that you kind of want
03:50 - to stay away from dynamic lights
03:51 - sometimes you need to have them but as a
03:54 - general rule don't include a lot of
03:56 - dynamic lights in your level or else
03:58 - your computers gonna lag so that being
04:01 - said we know the basic terminology of
04:03 - lights and basically static lights are
04:06 - better than dynamic for that reason so
04:08 - now let's go over two different types of
04:10 - lights so I showed you before if you go
04:12 - up to view browser windows in actor
04:14 - classes we get all these different types
04:17 - of lights now let's go ahead and let me
04:19 - explain to you guys what all these
04:20 - different types of lights are I guess I
04:22 - might as well just start from
04:23 - top and work my way down a directional
04:26 - light is basically you would use this
04:29 - whenever you're working with a really
04:30 - distant light source like the Sun that's
04:34 - all I'm gonna say right now so
04:35 - directional lights are pretty much a
04:36 - distant light source like the Sun or a
04:38 - light that you're never gonna get to
04:40 - directly a point lights is the light
04:43 - we're most familiar with it comes from a
04:44 - single point and affects all areas
04:47 - around it kind of like a light bulb
04:49 - that's the lights that we've been adding
04:50 - in our level just the like like things
04:53 - up real quick a skylight is it's kind of
04:56 - weird because I can't really explain
04:58 - this any good way what they did is they
05:01 - made two hemispheres a top and a bottom
05:04 - and they made like an infinite light
05:06 - source in this basically the reason you
05:09 - use skylights is whenever you want
05:11 - consistent ambient light across your
05:13 - entire level basically it's a broad
05:16 - light that can cover your entire level
05:18 - that's when you would use a skylight
05:20 - again I know I can't really explain to
05:22 - you guys what a skylight is because you
05:24 - can't really make one in the real world
05:26 - so I'm gonna have to show you guys
05:28 - whenever we're working with it and
05:29 - making a big level I'll show you guys
05:31 - what I mean so don't worry if you don't
05:32 - understand it right now and last but not
05:35 - least a spotlight like I covered in less
05:38 - storoe it's a light that comes from a
05:39 - single point that comes out in kind of a
05:42 - cone shape kind of like a flashlight so
05:44 - now you're saying all right I know what
05:46 - directional lights Point sky and
05:48 - spotlights are so what are all these
05:50 - little things right here whoa all these
05:52 - things have kind of like a normal
05:53 - setting first like skylight point light
05:56 - Direction light this is kind of like the
05:58 - default so aside from that you see
06:00 - toggle movable toggle moveable toggle
06:05 - moveable and I guess I'll tell you guys
06:07 - what toggle and movable toggle basically
06:10 - means that you can turn this light on
06:12 - and off so later on when we're learning
06:14 - unreal script and kismet which is
06:17 - basically how you program in the UDK I'm
06:20 - gonna be teaching you guys how you can
06:21 - make a light turn on and off so you
06:23 - would want to make that toggle now a
06:25 - movable light you see all of these
06:28 - classes have movable besides skylight
06:30 - because like I said that kind of covers
06:31 - the whole thing all these lights have
06:33 - moveable that basically means that
06:36 - they're dynamic
06:37 - and you can make paths to move them
06:39 - along so pretty much toggle means on and
06:42 - off moveable means that you can move
06:43 - them so that covers all of our lights
06:45 - except if you caught me you notice that
06:48 - I didn't cover these lights right here
06:50 - these lights down here are special
06:52 - lights called pickup lights where if you
06:55 - ever played a game where you could go
06:56 - around and pick up objects like money or
06:59 - weapons or armor or health this is what
07:01 - those lights are again there are special
07:04 - kind of light used whenever your
07:06 - characters running around around and
07:08 - they can pick up items so I'll be
07:10 - showing you guys those are really easy
07:12 - and simple to work with but that's what
07:14 - those are so don't forget that
07:16 - you know don't blame me because I didn't
07:17 - cover them because I just did so anyways
07:20 - that's all the importing lighting
07:22 - concepts so basically now you guys know
07:24 - all there is to know about the different
07:27 - types of lights and also the main
07:29 - concepts that basically whenever the UDK
07:33 - works with lights it turns all your
07:35 - static lights in the light Maps
07:36 - beforehand and it makes it really easy
07:37 - on your processor and well I basically
07:40 - told you guys everything you need to
07:42 - know so now we're in the working load
07:43 - lights you're gonna understand what I'm
07:45 - talking about a whole lot better and why
07:47 - I'm doing the things I do a whole lot
07:49 - better so for now that's all I got for
07:51 - you guys thank you guys so much for
07:52 - watching guys for subscribing and I'll
07:54 - see you guys in the next video
