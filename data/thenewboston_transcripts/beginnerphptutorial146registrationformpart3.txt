00:01 - so um we've completed our form
00:04 - validation essentially um and if our
00:06 - form isn't filled we keep in the values
00:09 - anyway in case uh well so users don't
00:12 - have to reenter every bit of data now
00:15 - what we want to do is we want
00:17 - to compare the two passwords so down
00:22 - here after we've validated the form we
00:24 - need to say or partly validated we need
00:27 - to say if password does doesn't
00:31 - equal password again do something
00:35 - otherwise complete the rest of the
00:37 - registration so in here if it doesn't
00:39 - equal we need to say um passwords do not
00:45 - match okay otherwise now we say
00:49 - Okay so let's um click register. PHP
00:54 - right so I can type my username in there
00:57 - um let's go down and do our first name
00:59 - and surname first so I'm going to typee
01:02 - pass one two3 and in this one I'm going
01:05 - to type pass one two so this is one less
01:08 - character than this therefore they don't
01:09 - match so let's click
01:12 - register and we get the uh error message
01:14 - passwords do not match so let's try
01:16 - again password oh no pass one two 3 pass
01:22 - one two 3 click register it's okay they
01:25 - match so now that we're okay here we
01:28 - need to start the registration
01:30 - process but what we need to do is we
01:33 - need to check if the username already
01:35 - exists in the
01:37 - database so how do we do this now we
01:40 - need to create a
01:41 - query let's just pull this down so we
01:44 - can uh have a bit of space the query is
01:46 - going to be
01:48 - select um and we're going to select
01:51 - username from so let's just pop this
01:54 - in postes select username from users so
01:59 - remember we're selecting let's just go
02:02 - back to here we select username from
02:07 - users where oh remember the
02:11 - uh there so where
02:16 - username equals and now what we can do
02:19 - is substitute in the username that the
02:21 - user has supplied here so we can say
02:24 - username now if this returns um a a row
02:29 - what's going to happen is it means that
02:30 - the username already exists cuz we're
02:32 - returning um a row which means we've
02:34 - successfully selected something where
02:36 - the username exists already so now let's
02:38 - run the query let's quick put that into
02:40 - a new variable so query run equals MySQL
02:45 - Query
02:46 - query and what we need to do now is we
02:49 - need to count the amount of rows so we
02:51 - say if MySQL num rows for query run so
02:57 - remember the query running is equal
02:59 - equal to one or is greater than or equal
03:02 - to one in in in the in the sense of this
03:04 - login and registration system it will
03:06 - never be two or three or any any higher
03:09 - so we can leave this equal to one
03:10 - because uh remember this process the
03:12 - whole point of it is to Not Duplicate
03:14 - the username so if the username equals
03:17 - one do something otherwise do something
03:20 - else in the case that it does equal one
03:23 - we need to
03:24 - say um the
03:27 - username concatenate on username that
03:30 - the username supplied already exists
03:35 - okay so otherwise we're saying okay so
03:40 - at the last part of our validation where
03:42 - we're validating where now not the form
03:44 - but whether the username exists so let's
03:47 - go back to our um register page blank
03:49 - that let's type in a username Alex
03:51 - password pass1 23 pass one two 3 first
03:56 - name Alex surname Garrett now when my
03:59 - register button we're going to do all
04:00 - the checks that we've already spoken
04:02 - about but now we're going to check if
04:04 - the username exists so let's check if
04:05 - that works we'll click register oh it
04:07 - says Okay Okay so let's double check
04:12 - everything select uh running that query
04:16 - if MySQL Query num equals
04:20 - 1 else okay
04:23 - um okay so let's test our query because
04:26 - it doesn't seem to be working as of yet
04:29 - let's pop that into um our SQL tab up
04:33 - here to see what
04:35 - happens okay so let's paste that in and
04:37 - click
04:39 - go um returned an empty result set so oh
04:42 - no sorry that's going to be equal to
04:46 - Alex click go okay so we are returning
04:50 - that value and let's think why we're not
04:54 - um getting any
04:57 - results okay so let's Echo out the usern
04:59 - name here just to uh go along with the
05:03 - uh process as we do it so let's go back
05:07 - to our page here and type in our
05:12 - password
05:13 - [Music]
05:17 - again AL okay so obviously there's a
05:20 - problem with our query
05:22 - somewhere cuz that username should be
05:25 - fed in
05:26 - [Music]
05:28 - properly
05:30 - now let's try to I mean it might be
05:32 - something simple that I'm completely
05:34 - missing uh let's try and Echo out MySQL
05:39 - num
05:41 - rows of our query that we've
05:45 - run see what that
05:50 - produces okay we're not getting anything
05:53 - from
05:54 - that
05:56 - so that means that no rows are being
05:59 - returned
06:03 - ah okay um
06:05 - yeah right okay okay
06:08 - so um what I've stupidly done is um
06:13 - perhaps you should learn from my mistake
06:15 - is we have this lovely file up here
06:18 - called connect. in.php which I haven't
06:20 - actually included so all of this is
06:23 - absolutely um well just the query is
06:26 - useless so let's go up and I'm going to
06:29 - require
06:32 - connect.
06:34 - in.php so I can connect to the database
06:36 - and therefore perform these uh
06:38 - operations correctly so let's go back
06:41 - here and we'll rype in uh pass one two 3
06:47 - pass one two3 click register the
06:51 - username Alex already exists
