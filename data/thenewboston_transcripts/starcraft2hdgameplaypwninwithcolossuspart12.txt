00:00 - what's going on guys welcome is bucky of
00:03 - course and like i said welcome to my
00:05 - very first starcraft 2 gameplay video
00:09 - and if you guys think that this is going
00:10 - to be the most impressive gameplay video
00:13 - you have ever seen you are wrong i've
00:15 - only been playing starcraft 2 for like
00:16 - two months i'm not that great but a
00:18 - bunch of you guys were requesting to see
00:20 - my gameplay and uh just to see me play
00:23 - starcraft 2 at least one time so here's
00:26 - a nice video for you guys so on my team
00:28 - i'm going be playing with dom flying
00:30 - panda who's gonna be playing zerg and on
00:33 - my ramp right here we're gonna be
00:34 - playing with jester who's gonna be
00:36 - playing taran
00:38 - and of course the greatest player of all
00:40 - time right here there's me the new
00:42 - boston i'm gonna be green throwing up a
00:45 - quick pylon and getting all those pros
00:47 - out trying to get resources early so i
00:49 - can tech up
00:50 - and uh let's take a look at our enemies
00:52 - right here s gonzo who is gonna be
00:55 - looking like he's gonna wall off early
00:57 - and there's my trademark oh my god wtf
01:00 - barbecue that i saved before every match
01:02 - i don't know why there's really no
01:04 - reason for it and after that you see
01:06 - pretty much the whole entire map gets
01:08 - involved talking about barbecue for
01:09 - about a minute but anyways back to the
01:12 - game looks like both of our enemies are
01:14 - going to be walling off with some
01:15 - barracks and supply depots and this
01:17 - protoss up here is throwing up two
01:19 - really quick gateways which is one of
01:22 - the worst strategies i've ever seen
01:24 - he really should be concentrating on his
01:26 - probes but anyways that might bite him
01:29 - in the butt later on so here's dom
01:30 - throwing up a quick forge he might be
01:32 - going for a cannon rush or he might just
01:34 - be using that throw some early cannons
01:37 - for defense against any marines that
01:39 - might be heading his way there are three
01:41 - things that have known dom to do a
01:44 - he can rush his lot b he gets the dark
01:47 - templars and tries to go in for early
01:49 - kills before they can get any detectors
01:51 - and c he builds massive voyagers a lot
01:54 - so we'll keep an eye on dom see what
01:56 - he's doing this match but anyways looks
01:58 - like they are going to successfully wall
02:00 - off both of their bases and i have my
02:03 - first gateway being built and also my
02:05 - two assimilators i like to pretty much
02:09 - cue up my nexus with a bunch of probes
02:11 - and take care of my pros first and once
02:14 - i have a nice resource collection right
02:16 - that's when i like to throw my sim
02:18 - layers i probably get my simulators
02:20 - earlier than most people but
02:23 - i do that for a couple of reasons one
02:26 - i hardly ever build any zealots i
02:29 - usually just go straight to stalkers so
02:31 - that's why i really have to concentrate
02:33 - on getting gas early and um two because
02:37 - i tech up
02:38 - faster than a lot of people instead of
02:40 - building first tier in so that's why i
02:42 - need gas as well but anyways we'll see
02:43 - how that works out so yes it does indeed
02:46 - look like dom's gonna use those cannons
02:48 - to protect his own base very smart move
02:51 - since they did wall off and uh they do
02:53 - look like they're gonna have some early
02:55 - marines so
02:56 - it also looks like dom's gonna leave a
02:58 - little space there between his cannons
03:00 - and his gateway so if any marines do
03:02 - decide to try and rush them they aren't
03:05 - going to see a wall that they can't get
03:06 - through turn around and run away to me
03:09 - they're actually probably going to try
03:10 - to
03:11 - run through those cannons be picked off
03:13 - so that's a strategy he uses a lot is a
03:16 - very good one instead of just deterring
03:18 - the marines he kind of baits him in as
03:20 - he picks him off with the cannon so
03:22 - here's my teammate as he promised that
03:25 - um deciding not to wall off her base
03:27 - instead he's going to throw up a bunch
03:29 - of barracks close to his uh command
03:31 - center
03:32 - and pump out some early marines so i
03:35 - mean it looks like those marines are
03:36 - going to be protecting our base so
03:38 - unless they make a huge push we should
03:40 - be good so here is flying panda as
03:43 - promised that early zergling rush and
03:46 - he should be pushing out soon because we
03:48 - have some marines coming our way there
03:50 - might be a early confrontation here so
03:53 - here are those marines they see those
03:55 - cannons right there and here is the
03:56 - confrontation oh
03:58 - wait a minute it looks like those
03:59 - zerglings are going straight for their
04:01 - base and those marines are going to
04:03 - stick make an early push towards dom's
04:06 - base and that's what i was talking about
04:07 - right here look at those cannons just
04:09 - slaughter those marines right there and
04:12 - yeah they are in rough shape they had
04:14 - about six marines now they have two
04:16 - actually one and a half looks like this
04:18 - probe is going to have to take business
04:19 - into his own hands and
04:21 - now looks like dom's going to mass
04:23 - probably rush him and here comes er
04:25 - who's just about to destroy all these
04:27 - marines right here look at all these
04:29 - blood oh that is just amazing so now
04:32 - it's going to try to pick off that high
04:34 - line try to slow down their supply and
04:36 - you see a bunch of stalkers being pushed
04:38 - in so those zerglings are also probably
04:40 - going to kill off above those stalkers
04:42 - although stalkers are probably the best
04:44 - thing that you can use for early uh
04:46 - zergling rush so let's go ahead and oh
04:49 - my god just look at this those zerglings
04:51 - are just eating those pros those probes
04:53 - did not stand a chance so there goes his
04:55 - entire workforce maybe he shouldn't
04:58 - spend so much time doing stupid gateways
05:00 - and uh buildings and those more forces
05:02 - so his teammates are gonna have to come
05:04 - in and save them and he's gonna have to
05:06 - totally rebuild his entire economy so
05:10 - looks like my teammate jester had to go
05:12 - in and save dom
05:14 - so uh
05:15 - looks like we are in pretty good shape
05:17 - right now and here is me sending my
05:20 - first group of stalkers probably the
05:21 - worst thing i could possibly do i have
05:24 - no idea why i did this um
05:27 - i really don't have a good reason but
05:28 - these suckers that i'm sending in are
05:30 - just going to get suicided right now um
05:32 - i don't know if i was trying to extract
05:34 - them or just pick up these early marines
05:36 - for
05:37 - you know i didn't want to rush or
05:39 - something but not a good strategy on my
05:41 - behalf but i promise this game gets
05:43 - better so
05:44 - as you can see they're just continuing
05:47 - to pump out massive marines and they're
05:49 - probably just gonna
05:51 - sit on the high ground and pick off my
05:53 - stalkers while my teammate let's see
05:55 - what he's doing he's just walking around
05:58 - with this bunch of uh
05:59 - marines and marauders and looks like dom
06:02 - has some void rays in the oven right
06:04 - there gonna be pumping out some voters
06:05 - soon and there's those marauders and
06:08 - marines just patrolling around just uh
06:10 - you know minding their own business but
06:11 - anyways
06:12 - it looks like our opponents have a bunch
06:14 - of stalkers to bone up which is good for
06:16 - me because i am taking up to immortals
06:19 - and as you know immortals pwn stalker so
06:22 - if it's his stalkers against my mortals
06:25 - i'm gonna win nine times out of ten so
06:26 - this is looking up uh very good for me
06:29 - but we're actually running out of time
06:32 - in this video i didn't want to put in a
06:34 - one long video so the massive battles
06:36 - are going to be coming in the next video
06:39 - or the next two videos i haven't decided
06:41 - yet however many it takes but yeah it
06:43 - looks like uh both teams are just
06:45 - working on their armies right now huge
06:48 - battles are
06:49 - sure to ensue soon so
06:52 - things are looking good for us so uh
06:54 - there's another zergling rush coming but
06:56 - as you see that's the end this video but
06:58 - thank you guys for watching uh don't
07:00 - forget to subscribe and yeah don't
07:02 - forget to check out the next video it's
07:04 - going to be pretty effing sweet
