00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the New Boston
00:05 - in this tutorial we're going to look at
00:07 - the jQuery slide down function and this
00:11 - is effect that this is an effect that
00:13 - will slide down a particular element and
00:16 - it works uh probably best with divs so
00:19 - what we're going to do is we're going to
00:20 - be creating a div uh which slides down
00:22 - at the top of the very top of the page
00:25 - now the first thing we need to do is
00:26 - style this div in order to make it look
00:29 - um
00:30 - make it look you know the right size so
00:33 - we can fade it down or slide it down so
00:37 - the first thing I'm going to do is the
00:38 - inclusion of a stylesheet so I'm going
00:41 - to say linkr
00:43 - equals
00:45 - stylesheet um the type is going to be
00:48 - text SL CSS and the source we're going
00:52 - to locate it in CSS SL
00:56 - style.css so let's go ahead and create
00:58 - this uh Style CSS file now um let's just
01:03 - save this file
01:04 - out uh into a directory uh CSS style.
01:09 - CSS okay so we can start to style this
01:12 - div um I'm going to include it first of
01:15 - all here just so we have reference to it
01:18 - so the div is there and the div ID is
01:21 - going to be topor message it's just
01:23 - going to be a message that slides down
01:25 - at the top of the screen uh and I'm
01:27 - going to put some content in here as
01:29 - well so we see you're not logged
01:35 - in do you want to sign up and we can
01:39 - create this as a link just as an
01:43 - example so now that we've got this in
01:45 - place you'll see that it looks something
01:47 - like this uh we've got we see you're not
01:49 - logged in do you want to sign up uh
01:51 - let's go ahead and style the page and
01:53 - this div as well so the first thing we
01:56 - want to do is change the body and we
01:59 - want to say m margin top n pixels and
02:03 - margin left n pixels in fact no that's
02:07 - not important okay so now for the top
02:10 - message we want to apply styling uh we
02:12 - want to say the width so the width I'm
02:15 - going to pick at 700 pixels I'm going to
02:18 - choose a background color for this as
02:22 - black and I'm going to choose padding as
02:25 - 10 PX uh let's go for 20 PX um we're
02:30 - also going to want to change the font
02:32 - size to make it look a bit bigger so 20
02:34 - pixels let's just take a look at how
02:36 - it's
02:41 - looking and that's not worked because
02:44 - this is not Source it's HRA okay let's
02:48 - go back to our page uh you can see it
02:49 - looks like this at the moment we
02:51 - obviously need to change uh a few things
02:53 - like the font color so we'll just say
02:55 - color # FFF that's white and we we also
03:00 - need to Center this as well so margin
03:04 - left Auto and margin right Auto so now
03:10 - that we've got the effect that we need
03:12 - except for the fact that we need to text
03:15 - align
03:17 - Center we can start to actually create
03:20 - something that's going to slide this
03:22 - downwards uh soon as we enter the page
03:25 - now obviously this isn't functional
03:26 - within an actual website it would get
03:28 - annoying um however just the effect
03:31 - itself can be useful uh perhaps it could
03:34 - perhaps you could include it in a
03:35 - specific function uh on specific pages
03:38 - and based on the fact if the user is
03:40 - logged in or not however for now this is
03:42 - just an example okay so the first thing
03:45 - that we need to do um I've included
03:47 - obviously jquery.js that's located in
03:50 - the JS folder as well as effects. JS
03:53 - which is also located in the JS folder
03:57 - now this is extremely simple we have our
04:00 - uh div just up here now we need to um
04:03 - initially have this hidden so there's
04:05 - one thing we need to change in our
04:06 - style. CSS and that is display none so
04:11 - now when we revisit our page in the
04:13 - browser you can see it is not um active
04:16 - it's still there as an element but it
04:18 - isn't uh shown yet so using jQuery we
04:21 - can slide this down so we're going to do
04:24 - this when the document has loaded so we
04:26 - use hash uh sorry dollar sign document.
04:29 - ready
04:30 - and inside of here we create a function
04:33 - and we give it a block so we have curly
04:35 - parentheses here as well as the F
04:37 - function um parentheses just here so I'm
04:40 - going to bring this just down a couple
04:42 - of lines so we can work within okay so
04:44 - now what we want to do it's a single
04:46 - line to actually create this effect so
04:48 - it's extremely easy to do and effective
04:51 - we want to reference top message and
04:54 - then use the uh slid down function so
04:57 - dollar and then inside of here we want
05:00 - to say topor message with a hash to
05:03 - reference the ID then we say dot slide
05:08 - oh sorry if I spell it correctly slide
05:10 - down and then in Brackets we can give
05:12 - some optional parameters in a moment
05:14 - however just the slide down function on
05:16 - its own will work so let's go back to
05:18 - our page and hit refresh you can see
05:20 - that that's slid down this div and quite
05:23 - nicely as well and quite smoothly Okay
05:26 - so we've got a a variety of parameters
05:28 - that we can give here we can give the
05:30 - speed um we can give the effect type how
05:34 - the effect actually slides and we can
05:36 - also give a callback function as well so
05:39 - uh I'm going to just go ahead and uh
05:41 - demonstrate the speed and if you go over
05:43 - to the jQuery documentation uh there's a
05:45 - variety of other options as well as the
05:47 - Callback function that you can Implement
05:50 - okay so I'm just going to say slow
05:53 - you'll see that now the speed has
05:54 - decreased very slightly if I was to go
05:57 - ahead and choose say 3,000 that equals
06:00 - to 3 seconds so that slides down a lot
06:03 - slower uh obviously that wouldn't uh be
06:06 - appropriate if we choose something like
06:08 - 500 or 300 uh that's 3 of a second so
06:12 - that slides down pretty quickly so
06:15 - obviously this example doesn't
06:17 - include um for example a button to
06:20 - actually you know make the um div go
06:23 - back up again however in the next part
06:25 - of the tutorial we're going to be
06:26 - looking at the slide up and we'll
06:28 - Implement a button that will actually uh
06:30 - slide this back up again
