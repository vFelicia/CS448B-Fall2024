00:01 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:04 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:06 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - taking a look at what's called
00:09 - concatenating strings now basically what
00:11 - this means is taking one string and
00:14 - adding another string to it and when you
00:17 - do this it's stored in another variable
00:19 - so let's go ahead and get started we're
00:21 - going to create a concatenate demo so go
00:24 - ahead and go to new project we will name
00:28 - this string concatenate and then we'll
00:33 - go ahead and click OK make sure you have
00:37 - selected a console application now here
00:41 - is module 1 let's go ahead and zoom in
00:44 - here a bit ok so now what we're going to
00:48 - do is we are going to create a string so
00:52 - dim user string as string and we'll go
00:57 - ahead and set that equal to nothing
00:58 - because we're going to have them type in
01:00 - a string now what we're going to do is
01:03 - we're going to create another string
01:05 - that will be stored in our program so
01:07 - dim program string as string and we'll
01:14 - just set that equal to something like
01:17 - catfish so now what we're going to do is
01:22 - we're going to prompt the user to enter
01:23 - in a string so we'll do console dot
01:28 - write line
01:31 - type anything you want so now what we're
01:37 - going to do is we're going to get what
01:38 - they typed so user string equals console
01:44 - dot readline so now what we're going to
01:49 - do is we're going to take their user
01:51 - string and add program string to it so
01:55 - but first we're going to print out what
01:57 - they type so console dot write line user
02:03 - string and now what we're going to do is
02:06 - we're going to add program string to it
02:07 - so user string equals user string plus
02:15 - program string so basically what this
02:19 - does is it takes user string and adds
02:21 - program string to it and it makes it all
02:23 - one word now let's go ahead not one word
02:26 - one string so let's go ahead and add a
02:28 - space here in catfish so it will you
02:30 - will be able to see the space in there
02:32 - and now what we're going to do is we're
02:34 - going to print out user string again and
02:41 - then we'll just have the program pause
02:44 - and wait for us to press Enter by using
02:47 - console dot readline and now we'll just
02:50 - run it and it'll say type anything you
02:52 - want so if we type in snowboarding go
02:58 - ahead and press ENTER it will say
03:00 - snowboarding and then it will say
03:02 - snowboarding which is what the user
03:04 - entered and then it adds program string
03:06 - to that now what we can do is we can
03:11 - come back in here and we can add more
03:14 - strings to this now these strings don't
03:16 - have to be variable so we can go ahead
03:18 - and add anything we want by enclosing it
03:21 - in quotes so we'll just type fishing
03:28 - so now we're just going to do is going
03:30 - to take what they typed add catfish and
03:32 - then add fishing now we can also use
03:36 - this which is what we've used in several
03:38 - other tutorials we can use the end sign
03:40 - inside of our console dot write line
03:42 - statement to add another string to it
03:44 - soldiers type hello YouTube what this
03:48 - does is it takes user string and adds
03:50 - hello YouTube to it for the time being
03:53 - and then it doesn't save hello YouTube
03:56 - it's just there when this console dot
03:58 - write line is called and then it
03:59 - disappears so let's go ahead and run
04:02 - this now I don't say type anything you
04:05 - want so I'll just type in Sam it shows
04:08 - us what we originally typed in Sam Sam
04:11 - catfish
04:12 - fishing hello YouTube so you can do this
04:15 - any way you want you could even add
04:17 - another string right here and
04:22 - concatenate as much as you want in the
04:24 - string but remember if you use the +
04:27 - sign inside of the arguments for console
04:29 - dot write line this is going to be
04:31 - discarded as soon as you're done with
04:33 - this statement or as soon as the program
04:34 - start with this statement so this is a
04:36 - very simple concept but I wanted to
04:38 - teach you guys that and it should be
04:40 - easy for you to understand and once you
04:42 - understand that go ahead and move on to
04:44 - the next tutorial
