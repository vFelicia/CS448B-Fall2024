01:34 - just need to review a bunch of open pr's
01:37 - mainly from website
01:42 - and then yeah i'll go through what we're
01:45 - working on
01:46 - yeah i need to write some tickets up
01:47 - pretty boring stuff
01:49 - and then going to be writing a release
01:51 - plan and then have product meeting later
01:52 - on
01:53 - and then after that just gonna record
01:55 - some videos
01:55 - [Music]
01:59 - also got my chat over here so
02:01 - [Music]
02:06 - all right so pr review time and also let
02:09 - me shift this over so i can
02:11 - read your guys comments as well
02:15 - has he been streaming or did i just
02:17 - start streaming i started streaming
02:19 - last night so
02:22 - all right apparently a lot of people
02:25 - thought i was dead
02:26 - so it's interesting
02:33 - man i'm gonna get easily distracted with
02:35 - all these so
02:36 - let's hop on over to github
02:47 - all right reviewed this one earlier mac
02:49 - instructions we got here
03:02 - okay
03:05 - so yes this pr looks to be
03:08 - for this let me show you guys
03:14 - so on the download page whenever you
03:17 - download for mac
03:18 - that there's additional step in here for
03:21 - some security
03:23 - or verified app
03:40 - okay so this is pretty old since it uh
03:44 - was here since november 9th i'm not sure
03:47 - if it's
03:47 - issues still where's the hat
03:51 - uh no hat today although i probably
03:53 - should put one on
03:54 - i like wearing a winter hat with uh my
03:56 - headset because it flakes
03:58 - and it kind of gets all over me but
04:01 - it's a little warm in here right now so
04:04 - [Music]
04:05 - i don't know hat or no hat what do you
04:08 - think
04:09 - we got ball cap or winter hat
04:14 - or just straight up my head
04:20 - all right there's one vote for winner
04:26 - him
04:47 - okay let's check this out apple cannot
04:49 - check for
04:50 - malicious software when you're
04:52 - downloading this
04:53 - and this is interesting too because we
04:56 - are uh
04:57 - certified
05:07 - pirate hat
05:11 - nice big head okay
05:14 - i guess you like my uh straight up head
05:36 - mm-hmm
05:57 - yeah this should be uh
06:04 - tutorial on unity i need a mod as well
06:10 - for this to prevent against these
06:12 - spammers
06:17 - so this is just a stream
06:20 - and i'm just going to be working on the
06:22 - digital currency network nothing special
06:24 - nothing planned just figure out if
06:26 - anyone wants to kind of tag along
06:32 - okay
06:46 - so
07:06 - so in order for this app to open without
07:09 - coming from the app store and without
07:10 - needing to do
07:11 - any special interactions which we do now
07:14 - we essentially right click and hit open
07:16 - you need to get the app notarized to
07:18 - developer process
07:21 - an automated process so i thought that
07:25 - this is what we did
07:32 - uh it always happens apps not download
07:34 - from the app store
07:35 - okay
07:41 - yeah since i did go through uh like
07:42 - apple's developer program and bought
07:45 - license to get notarized whatever it was
07:52 - okay so it seems like this is the
07:54 - correct solution
07:58 - [Music]
08:02 - so uh this this
08:10 - is
08:17 - okay let's add it in and okay
08:20 - since there's no related issue
08:25 - is this related could you say uh
08:28 - yeah maybe it is
08:37 - all right so this fixes issue number
08:44 - hmm is this related so this issue is
08:47 - apple cannot check
08:48 - for malicious software but it doesn't
08:51 - really
08:53 - describe the fix since it's still not
08:56 - checking
08:57 - but they are related so
09:02 - [Music]
09:07 - 431 actually i just paste this
09:10 - [Music]
09:13 - oh wait this is the account manager so
09:15 - this is different repo all together
09:19 - so let me just create an issue for this
09:22 - since it should be linked
09:38 - [Music]
09:48 - uh
09:51 - let's see special instructions
09:54 - [Music]
10:02 - all right let me submit this
10:13 - and also what was this original issue
10:17 - look like none
10:20 - upgrading my laptop to big sur as well
10:25 - can't see the letters this and that okay
10:33 - of this too big and it's hard for me to
10:36 - read
10:36 - so
10:43 - thank you for the tutorials you're
10:45 - welcome glad they could help
10:51 - all right so we have this newly created
10:54 - issue
10:55 - 114 and i'll just say this fixes
11:01 - [Music]
11:02 - 114 which it should pick up but it
11:04 - didn't
11:06 - so i can just do this beautiful
11:13 - now i just want to check this out to
11:16 - make sure it's all prettier than
11:17 - everything so i'm going to go my
11:19 - website repo pull it down
11:22 - and if you guys don't know how to do
11:24 - this on a web store
11:26 - whenever you are working on an open
11:28 - source project as the maintainer and
11:30 - someone submits a pr you can go to
11:32 - vcs get and then you can do volt
11:35 - view pull request and then if you don't
11:37 - have it already it gives you
11:38 - this little tab my laptop's updating
11:42 - right now by the way in
11:43 - its fan it's pretty loud but anyways
11:46 - let's get back to here so this
11:50 - uh poor request is from zeus lawyer dl
11:53 - mac instructions
11:55 - so we can probably just find that zeus
11:57 - lawyer
11:58 - mac instructions then you click this and
12:01 - then you can check out branch and then
12:02 - you can
12:03 - check out a tracking branch and create
12:07 - and now this should be good so npm
12:10 - install let me see what's up with that
12:13 - and let me also all right is that big
12:17 - enough for you guys
12:19 - i can't really do anything about this
12:21 - text yo yo
12:22 - what up
12:25 - what up hey everyone okay a couple
12:27 - people joining now
12:30 - all right so i can't do anything about
12:31 - the text on the side
12:35 - but it looks like these dependencies are
12:37 - just old and let me go to this file
12:42 - and what was this for
12:46 - so source containers download index
12:54 - all right so let me run this actually
13:02 - so that bad boy's booting up can get rid
13:04 - of this
13:06 - and another thing that i like to do
13:12 - is if you do npm run prettier
13:15 - then we have a npm script that
13:17 - essentially goes through all these
13:20 - files and just uh formats them correctly
13:23 - for some reason it keeps formatting ts
13:25 - config
13:28 - this is actually interesting if any of
13:29 - you guys know what's going on with this
13:31 - let me show you
13:34 - if you do get enroll back
13:37 - this is the fastest way i compare is
13:40 - that whenever i run prettier it changes
13:42 - jsx react to react hyphen jsx
13:46 - and i'm not sure why because this is a
13:48 - ts config
13:49 - i don't know why prettier keeps writing
13:52 - that
13:54 - or maybe it's my ide and it just happens
13:56 - while i'm running for it here
14:00 - wait you guys can't see the code
14:03 - can you guys see this
14:06 - man this is kind of annoying i have to
14:08 - scroll on each one
14:17 - can't stick around but bucky you're the
14:18 - reason i have six for your job right now
14:19 - thank you for that you
14:21 - are welcome josh the code isn't clear on
14:24 - 720p
14:25 - okay let's bump this up let's bump it
14:28 - way up let me actually
14:32 - okay
14:38 - the quality needs to be better not
14:40 - bigger text
14:41 - uh is this not 1080p
14:48 - all right let's take a little break and
14:50 - uh
14:54 - just make the stream all right so akrom
14:57 - says
14:59 - no it's not 1080 okay so
15:03 - so this is my second time streaming so
15:05 - how would i
15:06 - you look like an egg interesting
15:09 - all right no it's not 1080 so i probably
15:12 - have to restart my stream and make it
15:14 - 1080a
15:17 - heist is 720 all right so i'll be back
15:19 - in a second
15:21 - with uh an hd stream
15:27 - you
