00:00 - hello this is Alex from PHP academy' -
00:03 - all back with another video for the new
00:05 - Boston now in this short tutorial series
00:08 - about GED inside PHP we're going to be
00:12 - talking about what GD is and we're going
00:15 - to be doing a variety of things with GD
00:17 - and it's called the GD library
00:20 - it doesn't actually come with PHP by
00:24 - default so it's a library that you have
00:26 - to either install yourself or because
00:29 - we're using the xampp package as shown
00:34 - in my previous tutorials how to install
00:36 - it in windows GD will already come
00:39 - pre-installed with this and what we do
00:43 - is we use PHP directly and using this GD
00:49 - library what we can actually do is we
00:52 - can generate and we can also modify
00:55 - graphics so let's take an example and
01:00 - just speak about an example of what what
01:02 - how you might find GD useful now you may
01:06 - have seen websites that allow you to
01:08 - upload images or or groups of images so
01:13 - multiple images and you may find that
01:16 - these are watermarks I know eBay when
01:19 - you are upload an image it creates a
01:22 - little watermark in the bottom right
01:24 - hand corner which sort of you know gives
01:27 - the image some kind of relation to the
01:30 - website and this doesn't have to be a
01:33 - translucent watermark image it can in
01:35 - fact be some text so you can generate
01:38 - text with GD you can also watermark
01:43 - another image over over an image so
01:47 - there's a variety of things that you can
01:49 - do with the GD library now another
01:52 - example maybe you may have seen
01:54 - registration forms that ask you to enter
01:57 - some distorted characters or blurred
02:01 - outs or stretched characters and you'll
02:05 - obviously know this is for security
02:06 - purposes now why do we do this we use we
02:12 - use what
02:13 - called a capture form or capture image
02:17 - if you like to allow only human-based
02:21 - registrations or submission of data
02:23 - through a form so for example if you
02:26 - have a form and you want to the data to
02:29 - be submitted but not submitted in mass
02:31 - we use something called a capture image
02:34 - or security image really there is only
02:39 - human readable or most of the times of
02:42 - 90 plus percent of the time is human
02:44 - readable so the the distorted text has
02:49 - to be just has to be read and then input
02:52 - into another box by a user for the form
02:56 - to you know or for the user of the
02:59 - website for the owner of the website to
03:01 - be satisfied that only humans can
03:03 - register with this form then obviously
03:06 - if the incorrect image is entered or the
03:08 - text from the image is entered then it's
03:11 - asked to be done again so this prevents
03:14 - automatic submission of data through
03:16 - forms now another way to use THD which
03:20 - is a less commonly used method but a
03:22 - really interesting good way to use the
03:27 - GD library and by the way capture forms
03:30 - or security images if you like and not
03:33 - always used with GD so there's a variety
03:35 - of ways you can do this but in my future
03:38 - tutorials that you may watch you'll see
03:42 - that we deal with creating our own
03:44 - capture image using Gd so we're going to
03:47 - be using GD to Crower own and not allow
03:50 - a form to be submitted
03:51 - unless this image is correct so now
03:57 - another use like I said is less commonly
04:00 - used but a really really great great way
04:01 - to go about things is let's say I've
04:03 - registered on a website and I was to
04:06 - output my email address so this might be
04:09 - anything
04:11 - at anything calm now my email address
04:16 - let's say we output on my profile page
04:19 - now if my email address is in text form
04:22 - so it's in text form that can be picked
04:25 - up by say a robot for example it's been
04:28 - programmed to go through websites and
04:31 - pick up web a pick up email address is
04:35 - so you'll see some people choose to
04:37 - write the email address like this sorry
04:40 - like this or they might do something
04:46 - like dot there and then at there in
04:49 - brackets as well vice-versa using
04:52 - different symbols this is just simply
04:55 - for security purposes that they do this
04:57 - however a great way to store an email
05:00 - address when displaying it in a profile
05:02 - page to enhance the security of this so
05:06 - email addresses can't be collected in
05:08 - max this gives sort of peace of mind to
05:12 - your users if you store it in an image
05:14 - forum so what we can do is we can store
05:17 - this exactly as text so it can be text
05:20 - but we store it as an image so it can't
05:23 - be easily picked up by these bots now
05:25 - I'm not saying it can't be picked up at
05:27 - all of course it can because the point
05:29 - of capture forms being distorted is so
05:32 - it's hard for a bot to read or a
05:35 - computer program if you like to read but
05:38 - just by adding this into an image which
05:40 - is quite a simple process using GD just
05:43 - gives that added security so it's a lot
05:46 - more secure to store text as image if
05:49 - you don't want it to be automatically
05:50 - picked up by a piece of software that
05:52 - might be trading through websites trying
05:55 - to collect specific information so the
05:58 - GD library like I said is really useful
06:00 - for mainly these three things that could
06:02 - you can obviously use it for a variety
06:04 - of purposes it can it can take images
06:09 - and change them we can change colors we
06:11 - can change anything really we're not
06:13 - going to go into the complexities of
06:14 - these things because there are loads and
06:16 - loads and loads of functions used within
06:19 - GD it's a massive massive library with
06:23 - lots of functions and lots of ways
06:24 - to do this so I'm just going to give you
06:26 - sort of an introduction we're going to
06:28 - use these three examples we're going to
06:30 - change some text like this so an email
06:33 - address into an image we're also going
06:37 - to be looking at watermarking images as
06:40 - we upload them or just or just looking a
06:43 - function to walk watermark images so you
06:46 - can combine this with an upload script
06:48 - and we're also going to look at creating
06:50 - our own capture form so that's basically
06:54 - the GD library and what its useful if
06:56 - you are using it if you're having
06:59 - trouble using it so if the functions
07:02 - that you're giving that we're going to
07:03 - look at in other tutorials aren't
07:05 - working I suggest you go and google for
07:07 - GD have a look at downloading it and
07:10 - installing it but otherwise I'd highly
07:12 - recommend you use it pre-installed on a
07:14 - package such as xampp like I'm using and
07:18 - then it'll already already be there for
07:20 - you installed and it will be available
07:22 - to use
