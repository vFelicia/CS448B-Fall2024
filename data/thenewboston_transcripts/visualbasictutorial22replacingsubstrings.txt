00:02 - hello YouTube Sam I'm here from
00:04 - youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New
00:06 - Boston and in this tutorial we're going
00:08 - to be taking a look at replacing parts
00:10 - of a string so let's go ahead and get
00:12 - started we're going to come over here to
00:14 - new
00:18 - project and once it opens our new
00:20 - project window we're going to select a
00:22 - console
00:23 - application and I'm just going to call
00:26 - mine
00:28 - replacing
00:33 - substrings and let me pull this up here
00:35 - a bit and then just go ahead and click
00:38 - okay and it should load our
00:49 - project okay so now that our project has
00:51 - loaded let me go ahead and zoom in here
00:53 - a
00:56 - bit okay so now that our project has
00:58 - loaded we're going to going to go ahead
01:00 - and create a new variable so we'll just
01:02 - call it my
01:06 - string and we're going to create a
01:08 - second variable and we're going to call
01:11 - it final
01:18 - string okay so now what we're going to
01:19 - do is we're going to prompt the user to
01:22 - enter in any
01:23 - string so we're just going to type
01:28 - console. right line
01:32 - please enter a
01:36 - string now what we're going to do is
01:37 - going to get what they typed in so my
01:40 - string equals console.
01:48 - readline okay so after we get what
01:50 - they've typed in we're going to go ahead
01:53 - and remove part of that string or
01:55 - replace that part of that string with
01:57 - another string so we're going to type
01:59 - final
02:01 - string equals my string and then we're
02:04 - going to use dot to see what we can use
02:06 - for my string now you can see there's a
02:09 - whole bunch of stuff here we're going to
02:11 - type
02:13 - replace so now what we're going to do is
02:16 - going to go we're going to go through
02:18 - here and we will just type in the first
02:22 - argument a inside of quotes which is the
02:25 - old value the value that we want to
02:27 - replace and we're going to replace a
02:29 - with the new value so let's just do
02:33 - n and then finally we will write that
02:36 - out on the
02:42 - console and then we'll just do
02:44 - console.readline so it waits for us to
02:47 - input something before it closes and now
02:49 - we're going to start running this
02:52 - program it's going to say please enter a
02:55 - string so I type Sam
02:58 - um do dog
03:01 - cat
03:04 - Cow uh
03:08 - astronomy now if I press enter you can
03:10 - see that all of the A's were were
03:12 - replaced with an N so here we have Sam
03:15 - and you can see down here it's SN M the
03:18 - A and cat was replaced with an n and
03:21 - this is an astronomy instead of
03:24 - astronomy so we can also do this with
03:26 - something larger than just one character
03:29 - so if I type hello in here we can
03:32 - replace it with let's say
03:37 - goodbye so now if I type in something
03:39 - like hello um on live gamer it's going
03:45 - to replace it with goodbye on live gamer
03:47 - now if you don't type hello in your
03:50 - first string it's not going to replace
03:52 - it at
03:53 - all and I'll just show you that right
03:57 - here so if I just type the new boss in
04:00 - here it's just going to give me the new
04:03 - Boston back because it didn't find hello
04:05 - anywhere inside of that
04:07 - string so this is a pretty uh simple
04:10 - tutorial uh thanks for watching Once you
04:12 - guys have this um nailed down and you
04:15 - know how to do it go ahead and move on
04:17 - to the next
