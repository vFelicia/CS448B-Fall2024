00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:06 - and in this tutorial we're gonna
00:08 - continue working on the log for our game
00:11 - now you may be may be wondering how are
00:15 - we going to use the name of the zombie
00:17 - or not zombie the enemy if we don't have
00:22 - name variables that store their names so
00:24 - what we can do is let's come in come in
00:27 - to each class we'll do public string
00:31 - name as string and we'll set it equal to
00:36 - Zambia now there is one problem with
00:40 - this this would seem like a simple
00:42 - solution but if we come over here to
00:44 - form one dot V B or yeah format maybe
00:48 - you see that current enemy is subtype
00:51 - enemy and so anything that current enemy
00:54 - can do enemy should be able to do too so
00:58 - if we're calling a current enemy
00:59 - function here or a method or a variable
01:02 - enemy has to contain that variable so
01:05 - come over here and we'll get rid of this
01:08 - that's not needed
01:09 - so we'll do public string name as string
01:14 - and you could ignore that thing I was
01:16 - just deleted because I was just
01:18 - experimenting with the code so we've got
01:20 - public string name a string so now we
01:22 - can come in here you can see that we get
01:23 - a message that says it conflicts it
01:27 - conflicts I mean with a string name in
01:29 - enemy so in order to get rid of that
01:32 - instead of read a cleric string name we
01:35 - can just go ahead and set that equal to
01:36 - a value so it's going to be zombie and
01:43 - we need to go ahead and copy this or
01:46 - we'll cut it and we need to put it in
01:49 - our constructor so the names gonna be
01:53 - equal to zombie when a new zombie class
01:56 - is created
01:57 - so in our constructor for Dragon will do
02:00 - string name it's gonna be equal to
02:03 - dragon villain
02:08 - string name it's gonna be equal to
02:10 - filling okay so now that we have string
02:16 - name for each of the enemies and it's in
02:19 - the enemy class so we can use it on an
02:23 - enemy object we can go ahead and use
02:26 - that whenever we need it okay so now
02:30 - that we've got all this working we've
02:31 - created our damaged arrays we've used
02:34 - names and some indirection to make it
02:37 - easier to access parts of our program in
02:40 - our variables what we want to do is go
02:43 - ahead and create one of the logs now we
02:46 - have event log VB now this isn't just
02:50 - gonna automatically open when our
02:51 - program run runs we have to tell it to
02:54 - open because form or not VB is the form
03:00 - that is run by default and no other
03:02 - forms will run so we need to come in to
03:04 - form one DB and whenever it loads we
03:09 - need to create a new log so we'll just
03:13 - declare one of those so-dimm new log as
03:19 - new event log
03:26 - and we need to event log VB now it looks
03:30 - like we lucked out here because there's
03:32 - already an event log built into Visual
03:34 - Basic so we did event log VB so after
03:38 - that's done what we need to do is type
03:41 - new log dot Show so it will show us our
03:45 - new log now we want to be able to access
03:47 - new log outside of just form one dot
03:49 - load so we can go ahead got this right
03:53 - here and we will paste it in the class
03:59 - itself and we'll just declare it as
04:02 - private so now that we have new log and
04:06 - it shows when it's open let's go ahead
04:08 - and add some stuff to the log but first
04:12 - I'll show you that it opens with it so
04:16 - here is our game and then here's our
04:19 - logged C says event logger has
04:22 - successfully loaded and it allows you to
04:26 - select indexes of this so we'll go ahead
04:30 - and close out of these so whenever you
04:33 - attack the the enemy after we attack
04:39 - them what we want to do is we want to
04:42 - create that event so we will just type
04:47 - new log dot list events
04:56 - or we don't want list events we want to
04:58 - do let's see here figure out what the
05:02 - name of that is add event so we want to
05:05 - add an event so new log dot add event
05:08 - and we need an event as a string
05:12 - so since create event is a function and
05:15 - it returns a string we can use that as
05:17 - the argument for add event so we can
05:20 - just add event and we can create event
05:22 - and then the argument is going to be pop
05:29 - I dot name okay so this might be a
05:36 - little bit confusing to you but we we
05:40 - added an event to our list box and for
05:44 - the arguments of that we use create
05:46 - event which is a string because that's a
05:48 - function and it used it returns a string
05:50 - and that function requires an argument
05:53 - itself which is the name of whoever it's
05:57 - making the event for so we'll do that
06:01 - once more for the enemy attack so let's
06:07 - see as soon as it attacks we want to
06:09 - create the event but first we have to
06:12 - type new log dot add event and then we
06:16 - want to create an event so create event
06:19 - and then we'll do
06:24 - current enemy dot name or string name so
06:32 - it's gonna create an event based on
06:34 - their name and it's gonna pass that to
06:36 - the add event method in new log so
06:39 - hopefully we won't get any errors from
06:42 - this okay so here's our game and I'll
06:46 - just drag the log over here and if we
06:50 - attack looks like we got an error here
06:55 - okay so we got a bit of an error there
06:58 - and I'll tell you why so whenever Popeye
07:02 - it adds the log for Popeye it says hero
07:06 - dog attack damaged which is a
07:08 - an array of integers and it uses at
07:11 - index of attack num now we can't put an
07:14 - integer into a string an argument that
07:19 - takes a string or returning as a string
07:21 - we can't put an integer in there so we
07:23 - need to convert that to a string so this
07:26 - is gonna be the number this is gonna be
07:28 - the damage that is returned which will
07:31 - be an integer and then we just convert
07:32 - that integer integer to a string so
07:36 - we'll do that once more for this one so
07:39 - current enemy dotted for the attack
07:43 - damage dot to string so we've converted
07:46 - each of those to a string now we'll go
07:48 - ahead and try this one more time and it
07:52 - says event logger has successfully
07:54 - loaded and then we can go ahead and
07:56 - attack and you can see that says papaya
07:58 - has used kick for a 10 damage and then
08:01 - zombie has used punch for 10 damage and
08:03 - let's just use spinach now you can see
08:07 - that it says 10 damage right in here we
08:10 - haven't accounted for in case Popeye
08:12 - uses spinach and we're going to be
08:14 - learning about that in the next tutorial
08:16 - see Popeye uses kick for 10 damage and
08:20 - then use just 5 let's see let's try to
08:23 - get popped by to use anchor throw aha
08:24 - Popeye has used anchor throw for 15
08:27 - damage so what this does is it just logs
08:29 - everything that happens each time one of
08:32 - the users attacks or gets attacked so go
08:37 - ahead and close out of that so go ahead
08:39 - and put this code in if you haven't
08:40 - already then once you've done that if
08:42 - you don't understand it leave some
08:43 - comments I'll try to answer the any
08:45 - questions for you and then after that
08:47 - move on to the next tutorial
