00:00 - so now we can put it into its own
00:01 - variable so we can use it a bit better
00:03 - later so we're going to say text equals
00:05 - dollor poost uh text that just saves us
00:09 - writing out this dollor poost text again
00:12 - and again okay so now what we're going
00:14 - to do is we're going to check if this
00:15 - equals a value so we don't want to be uh
00:17 - inserting empty values into our database
00:20 - we want to be uh entering at least some
00:22 - text so I'm going to say if not empty um
00:26 - and we're going to say text so we're
00:28 - referencing text into here here and if
00:30 - not empty text we do something else I'm
00:34 - going to Echo out remember we're echoing
00:37 - out whatever output we get from this
00:39 - update. in. page we're update sorry
00:42 - we're outputting it into our message div
00:45 - down here so we can we can give error
00:47 - messages to the user and it will pop up
00:49 - without refreshing the page this is the
00:50 - whole point of Ajax it gives you things
00:52 - a lot quicker and without refreshing the
00:54 - page so it's a lot easier to deal with
00:56 - so we can say uh please type A
01:00 - um please type something for
01:03 - example uh so let's just go ahead and
01:05 - Echo our okay here just so we know what
01:08 - we're doing uh and let's go ahead and
01:12 - submit nothing okay so it says please
01:15 - type something now let's insert our type
01:17 - Alex click submit okay so we know that
01:20 - that's working that's great now we can
01:22 - start constructing our query to insert
01:24 - this data into the database and then
01:26 - check whether the query was successful
01:28 - or not so let's start constructing the
01:30 - query uh this is quite simple uh I have
01:33 - tutorials on this as well so go back and
01:34 - refer to them if you're you're stuck on
01:36 - this bit uh we're going to say insert
01:39 - into and now we choose the table name so
01:42 - if we go back to PHP my admin we can see
01:44 - the table name is data so we're
01:46 - inserting into this data table and then
01:49 - we say values and inside parentheses
01:52 - we're going to supply the amount of
01:54 - values and the values that we want to
01:55 - input so we're going to say two values
01:58 - so we've got two of string data here if
02:01 - you
02:01 - like the first one is an ID and it's an
02:04 - autoincrement so we don't need to
02:06 - specify a value we can keep this blank
02:08 - what that will do is the database will
02:10 - automatically update it uh to the next
02:13 - number in line in the increment but in
02:16 - here what we need to do is specify this
02:18 - text here now we do need to add some
02:20 - level of security so we need to add um
02:23 - we need to basically escape from this
02:24 - string here and append on this text
02:27 - variable and then we need to append on
02:29 - the rest of the string now what we can
02:31 - do is we can use the MySQL real
02:35 - Escape string function and en close that
02:38 - text in that and the reason we do this
02:40 - is because uh SQL injection is possible
02:43 - whenever we're allowing a user um a user
02:47 - a dynamic user input uh going into a
02:51 - query um can always result uh
02:54 - potentially in SQL injection so now
02:57 - we're going to say query run equals
03:00 - MySQL Query and then obviously the query
03:03 - uh string inside of there so let's just
03:06 - add this into an if statement so we can
03:08 - check if it's worked so if query run
03:11 - equals MySQL Query what this is going to
03:13 - happen what's going to happen here sorry
03:15 - is this is going to return true if uh
03:18 - the query was a success so we can say in
03:20 - here uh success else we can say failed
03:25 - so let's
03:26 - Echo failed oh not in capitals it's a
03:29 - bit rude so failed and then otherwise
03:32 - here we can say Echo um data inserted
03:37 - for example okay so now let's run back
03:40 - to um our browser and test this out so
03:43 - as it stands inside our database we've
03:46 - got no values in here so MySQL returned
03:48 - an empty result set i z r so we've got
03:51 - nothing in in our database at the moment
03:53 - or in our table rather so now I'm just
03:55 - going to pop my name in there and I'm
03:57 - going to click submit so so it says data
04:00 - inserted so now I can presume that the
04:02 - data's been inserted into the database
04:04 - let's go in and let's click on browse
04:07 - and you can see that it has in fact
04:09 - inserted this data let's go ahead and um
04:13 - type something else so we'll type do and
04:15 - click submit and we get the same message
04:17 - back again uh it hasn't changed so I
04:19 - presumed that that has just um reiven me
04:22 - the data inserted VAR uh Echo uh and
04:25 - yeah it's inserted more data so now we
04:28 - can start in start to
04:30 - insert uh different data and whatever we
04:33 - want so there's not really much much
04:35 - point to this um application itself but
04:39 - hopefully from this tutorial you can go
04:40 - away um with your knowledge now of the
04:44 - post um the post data or posting data
04:48 - using Ajax as opposed to using get
04:51 - data and you can apply it to your own uh
04:55 - your own
04:56 - uses so we've gone through the Ajax
04:58 - stage of things we've gone through uh
05:00 - the HTML and the div and we've also more
05:03 - importantly gone through the PHP and how
05:06 - we can combine that with Ajax um and
05:09 - taking our post variable in order to
05:11 - post a value to the database or insert a
05:14 - value into a database
