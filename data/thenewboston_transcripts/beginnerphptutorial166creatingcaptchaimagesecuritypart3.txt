00:00 - okay so you can see that we are
00:02 - generating at generating out some data
00:03 - and displaying these numbers that have
00:07 - been generated so let's refresh a couple
00:09 - of times and see if these change yet
00:10 - they are in fact changing now let's have
00:12 - a look at the width of the image so the
00:14 - width of the image is a bit off it's way
00:16 - too big so we need to decrease it by
00:19 - about half so let's go ahead and do that
00:21 - this is not really going to be much
00:23 - changes to be made so let's change that
00:25 - to 100 and come into refresh okay so
00:29 - that looks about right actually our
00:32 - image size our that's the problem
00:33 - because we might have a slightly longer
00:36 - characters so let's change this to 120
00:38 - just to be safe
00:42 - maybe 110 so it's just a matter of
00:46 - fiddling around with things until you're
00:47 - happy so I'm quite happy with this now
00:50 - the only thing the only problem with
00:52 - this is that we need to generate some
00:56 - kind of noise and we need to generate
00:58 - something that masks these letters and
01:01 - is still readable by humans but might
01:04 - not be readable by a computer
01:06 - so let's come down to just after we set
01:10 - our text color because the function that
01:11 - we're going to be using is going to
01:13 - require a text color in there and the
01:16 - function that we're going to be using is
01:18 - image line and this image line function
01:23 - takes a few parameters I'll just explain
01:26 - the function before we continue the
01:28 - first one is the image that we're
01:30 - working with the second one is we need
01:34 - we need to specify x1 and y1 and x2 and
01:42 - y2 and then the text color so we've
01:46 - already got this variable defined here
01:49 - so this is even though it says text
01:51 - color where we're creating the lines to
01:54 - be black as well this is the exactly the
01:56 - same so these are just the coordinates
01:59 - that we're creating that so we want to
02:00 - do something we want to create
02:03 - coordinates that are completely random
02:05 - that so they're going to be splashed
02:07 - across our image so how can we do this
02:10 - well I'm going to create a for loop for
02:12 - this and we're going to loop a specific
02:15 - amount of times and we're going to
02:16 - generate for variables which is x1 x2 y1
02:21 - and y2 and then what we're going to do
02:23 - is we're going to put these into the
02:26 - image line function in order to generate
02:29 - random lines with different coordinates
02:31 - that are going to be you know changing
02:33 - chopping and changing each time so we've
02:36 - created a for loop the skeleton for our
02:38 - for loop we're going to set the variable
02:40 - first of all which is X equal to 1 and
02:42 - then I'm going to say while X is smaller
02:45 - than or equal to let's give it a value
02:48 - about 34 now what this means is 30 lines
02:52 - are going to be generated because we're
02:54 - going to run this image line function
02:55 - inside our for loop so 30 lines are
02:58 - going to be generated remember we need
03:00 - to increment our x value each time so
03:03 - essentially what this does is it's going
03:06 - to loop 30 times this is this loops
03:08 - going to loop 30 times
03:09 - so for each 30 times that we loop we
03:12 - want to create a variable x1 y1 x2
03:21 - oh and y2 and these are going to be
03:25 - equal to a random value okay so we need
03:28 - a random value for each one of these so
03:30 - again we can use make use of our round
03:32 - function as we did in here but this time
03:35 - we're going to be generating a number
03:37 - with a lower limit of a hump lower limit
03:39 - of one and an upper limit of a hundred
03:41 - so we can do that for each one I mean
03:46 - again you feel free to chop and change
03:48 - with these you can mess around with
03:50 - values depending on what kind of output
03:53 - you're looking for but for now this is
03:56 - going to generate a number between 1 and
03:59 - 100 and now down here we can apply that
04:01 - to our image line function so remember I
04:04 - said the first parameter is image width
04:06 - which is the image we're working with at
04:07 - the moment and then we're taking in x1
04:10 - and then we need to take in x2 or y1
04:18 - sorry and then I mean it doesn't really
04:23 - matter in the order that you put them in
04:25 - but I'm just adhering to the order in
04:29 - which this function takes parameters so
04:32 - the last one we need to put in is y2 and
04:34 - then obviously like I said before we
04:36 - need to define a color for these lines
04:38 - so you can feel free to choose your own
04:42 - colors but I'm just going to be creating
04:44 - this black because I feel it merges with
04:46 - the fun a lot better and this means that
04:50 - it's going to be a bit harder to read so
04:54 - we're inside our image we're creating a
04:57 - line so using the image line function in
04:59 - these coordinates which would tightly
05:01 - round them so it's going to splash them
05:02 - across our image and we create new in
05:04 - black so now let's go back and preview
05:07 - our image and see what it looks like
05:09 - okay so great what we're doing now is
05:12 - we're generating our random lines
05:13 - they're all across our image and it's
05:16 - quite hard to see the numbers but if you
05:18 - do look carefully you can still make
05:20 - them out I think this one is 3 9 it's
05:23 - either a 7 or 1 and 3 and some are going
05:26 - to be harder to read than others I think
05:28 - this is 6 4 double 1
05:30 - so the point across it at the point of
05:32 - this is it's still human readable but by
05:36 - a computer standards it might be quite
05:38 - hard to read this because we've got
05:41 - these lines going across okay so what
05:44 - are we going to do next well we've
05:45 - generated everything here now what I
05:48 - want to do is just echo out on this page
05:50 - and we're going to come down here under
05:52 - our image and that's put a line break on
05:55 - the end of our image so we keep
05:56 - everything neat and tidy I'm going to
05:58 - echo out the secure session just to make
06:01 - sure that each time it matches what we
06:03 - have in our image so let's refresh now
06:07 - we've got eight seven five six here this
06:09 - looks like eight seven five and a six to
06:12 - me we've got nine one two five here so
06:15 - we've got gnome one to five that looks
06:16 - about right and two three seven nine so
06:19 - you understand the point of this is that
06:21 - we're just making sure that they match
06:23 - every time
