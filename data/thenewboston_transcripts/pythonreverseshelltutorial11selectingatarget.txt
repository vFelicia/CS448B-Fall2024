00:00 - all right guys so before we get into
00:02 - selecting the target what I want to do
00:03 - is I want to run this program real quick
00:05 - and I'll show you guys pretty much what
00:07 - we did so far and what we're going to
00:09 - have to do next so what we did is let me
00:13 - just start this right here is whenever
00:15 - we run the script the first thing that's
00:17 - going to pop up is this right here just
00:19 - this interactive prompt So then whenever
00:23 - a client start connecting let me run
00:25 - this real quick we're going to see a
00:27 - little indicator that says connection
00:29 - has been established and whatever their
00:32 - IP address is so this is my IP address I
00:34 - just connected to it so now that we're
00:36 - in Turtle remember we gave it two um
00:39 - prompts custom prompts you can type in
00:42 - list and then what it does whenever you
00:44 - do that is we built this in the last
00:48 - video where at all right so what does is
00:51 - it goes through and it lists all of the
00:53 - computers that are currently connected
00:55 - to your server so it just gives them an
00:58 - ID number which is pretty much the list
01:00 - number and then their IP address and
01:03 - then their port so then later on you're
01:06 - going to be able to say select
01:10 - zero and you know eventually we're going
01:12 - to have more 1 2 3 4 5 or whatever and
01:15 - whenever we select it it says you are
01:17 - now connected to that computer and from
01:21 - here you can just write like whatever
01:23 - you want so Echo hey and look on their
01:26 - machine it says hey whatever and
01:29 - eventually also we're going to be able
01:30 - to type in quit and then we're going to
01:33 - get back to our main program so list and
01:37 - I'll show you guys a bunch of cool stuff
01:39 - that you can do with that and how to
01:40 - customize it however you want but just
01:43 - to reiterate what we did so far is we
01:45 - just listed the connections we're just
01:48 - displaying them now in this tutorial
01:51 - what I want to do is I want to show you
01:52 - guys how to actually select a computer
01:55 - so let me stop that and that's what
01:58 - we're going to do all right
02:01 - so I'll say select uh uh Target client
02:07 - and if you guys were like wait a minute
02:08 - I just try to run this program and it
02:10 - doesn't work like yours did that was
02:12 - another um I have the completed program
02:15 - already and you know that was from that
02:18 - so if you try to run this right now it's
02:20 - going to give you a bunch of Errors so
02:22 - you know just a heads up in case you
02:23 - guys were trying to figure that out all
02:25 - right so Define get Target
02:30 - and we're going to pass in the command
02:32 - right here all right so this function
02:34 - right here remember if they typed in
02:37 - list then it's just going to display all
02:39 - the computers that are connected now
02:41 - once they review that list and they find
02:42 - one that they want to control they're
02:44 - going to write select and then their ID
02:46 - number so I wrote select zero and then I
02:49 - was connected now what we also pass this
02:52 - in is the command so the entire command
02:56 - so this isn't any actual code code so
02:59 - it's going to be like select zero select
03:01 - one select two So eventually what we're
03:03 - going to do is we're just going to rip
03:05 - out this part of the command so we only
03:08 - return the ID number so it's going to be
03:11 - pretty simple but we need to do some
03:12 - weird things so what I'm going to do
03:15 - first is just make a simple try I always
03:18 - call it try catch try accept whatever so
03:21 - this is the easy part we're going to
03:23 - command
03:25 - replace and what do we want to replace
03:28 - we just want to replace select and make
03:30 - sure you add a space after this because
03:32 - it's going to be like select zero select
03:35 - 54 and if you
03:37 - just try to replace select then it's
03:40 - going to return space like 64 or
03:43 - whatever so you actually want to replace
03:45 - this and what do you want to replace it
03:48 - with just nothing so now this variable
03:52 - right here should be equal to just the
03:55 - number now another thing that we want to
03:57 - make sure of is right now it's equ equal
03:59 - to a number but it's in the string
04:01 - format since that's what they typed in
04:04 - so what we want to do is we need to
04:05 - convert it to an integer and I'll just
04:08 - write Target right there and you can
04:10 - actually wrap this all in one line but I
04:12 - want to keep things simple all right so
04:15 - now this variable is an integer of
04:18 - whatever the computer they want to
04:20 - connect to and now what we're going to
04:22 - do is we're actually going to get the
04:24 - connection object so from all
04:28 - connections all the computers that are
04:30 - connected we want to connect to
04:35 - Target so whatever connection was in
04:38 - that list that's the one we're trying to
04:39 - connect to and now we're just going to
04:41 - print out a little indicator say you are
04:43 - now connected to this computer or
04:45 - whatever so I'll just
04:47 - write um you are
04:50 - now connected
04:52 - [Music]
04:56 - to all
04:58 - addresses what is the item in the list
05:01 - well that's just
05:03 - Target and zero zero is their IP one is
05:07 - their port so remember this connection
05:09 - object is what we're going to return and
05:11 - that way they can have a bunch of
05:13 - computers connected but they can only
05:16 - pretty much um be interactive with one
05:18 - at a time it's freaking beautiful so
05:21 - print after this remember that I don't
05:24 - know if that's going to pop up but you
05:26 - remember as soon as you became connected
05:28 - to another computer what it did is it
05:31 - didn't say turtle anymore it actually
05:33 - gave you the IP address of that computer
05:36 - and that was the new input so then you
05:38 - know you're not in the interactive
05:39 - prompt anymore you're actually
05:40 - controlling their machine so I actually
05:43 - need to convert it to a string in well
05:46 - this right
05:50 - here so now we'll just uh use the RP
05:54 - address
05:56 - and give you that little greater than
05:59 - indicator and I also want to write end
06:02 - equals blank because if we just print
06:05 - this
06:06 - out without out this parameter right
06:09 - here then it's going to print out your
06:10 - prompt and then it's going to move your
06:12 - cursor down to the next line however
06:14 - whenever you
06:15 - have an interactive prompt it prints it
06:18 - out in the cursor is right on the same
06:20 - line it's not on the new line so that's
06:21 - why I need to say end right there so it
06:24 - keeps your cursor on the same line and
06:26 - now the last thing I want to do is I
06:29 - just want to add in accept so basically
06:33 - what they're going to do is they're
06:34 - going to try to connect to this computer
06:37 - however if we ever get you know an
06:39 - invalid connection we don't want to
06:40 - continue on with the program we just
06:41 - want to take care of it and let them
06:43 - know that something went wrong and I'll
06:45 - just say uh not a valid selection so
06:50 - maybe whenever they listed all computers
06:52 - there are only five computers and list
06:54 - but they tried to select 13 like number
06:57 - 13 and that's you know it's not going to
06:59 - work work so we're just going to say
07:00 - that and since we need to return
07:03 - something then we're going to return
07:06 - none and up here we actually need to
07:07 - return the
07:10 - connection all right so whenever they
07:13 - get the Target and write select one or
07:16 - select three it's going to go through
07:18 - connect
07:19 - it and return our connection object if
07:22 - we write select tuna or select
07:25 - 828 and it's not valid then it's going
07:28 - to just print out not a valid selection
07:30 - you dummy and then it's just going to
07:32 - return none so looking good uh yeah in
07:35 - the next tutorial what we're going to do
07:36 - is we're actually going to start sending
07:38 - them commands getting into the good
07:40 - stuff so I'll see you guys then
