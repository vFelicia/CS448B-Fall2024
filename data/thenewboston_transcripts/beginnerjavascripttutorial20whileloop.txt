00:00 - what's going on guys it's Bucky and
00:02 - welcome to 20th I believe JavaScript
00:04 - tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going
00:06 - to be talking about a while loop but
00:08 - before I begin I just want to say guys
00:09 - if my voice squeaks or if I stop talking
00:13 - like if I'm in the middle of sentence I
00:16 - just suddenly stop talking that's
00:18 - because like my voice is like given out
00:19 - like I can be in the middle of sense and
00:22 - my lips will still be moving but
00:23 - nothing's coming out so I got this lucky
00:25 - mucus phlegm in my throat and it's no
00:28 - predicting what it does so it's not my
00:30 - microphone it's not your speakers it's
00:31 - just my annoying raspy voice oh you guys
00:34 - just got to deal with it I guess I
00:36 - apologize but anyways let's go ahead and
00:39 - learn about this stupid thing called a
00:40 - while loop go ahead and well let me say
00:43 - this first of all a while loop is
00:45 - basically the same as a for loop all
00:47 - loops are pretty much the same they do a
00:49 - certain bit of code over and over and
00:51 - over again until you tell it to stop so
00:53 - why use a while loop and while you use a
00:55 - for loop well they're just set up a
00:57 - little bit different the syntax is a
00:59 - little bit different I think a while
01:01 - loop is a little bit easier to
01:02 - understand some people like for loops
01:04 - and they're going to come across
01:06 - different situations where you can only
01:08 - use one or the other but anyways that's
01:09 - my little introduction you know the
01:11 - history of the while loop so let's go
01:13 - ahead and the first thing that we need
01:15 - is a counter variable to keep track of
01:17 - how many times this loop actually loops
01:19 - so x equals 1 will start at 1 just like
01:23 - you know we did with a for loop so now
01:25 - the syntax for a while loop is pretty
01:27 - simple it's a while and then you have in
01:29 - here how long do you want to loop the
01:32 - last blue so let's go ahead and put X is
01:35 - less than 10 so this is pretty much
01:39 - going to loop this bit of code so long
01:42 - as X stays less than 10 so now we can
01:45 - either increment it by like 1 2 or 3 or
01:47 - 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 so now let's just give
01:50 - a go ahead and give it some simple code
01:52 - right out so document dot
01:55 - right and actually what we can do is we
01:58 - can print out the value of the variable
02:04 - I guess the counter variable right there
02:06 - so we can actually see it that might be
02:07 - a little easier to understand and now
02:09 - let's go ahead and add some text like
02:11 - how do you like them apples first person
02:15 - who can tell me what movie is that from
02:17 - gets gets my respect there you know I'm
02:21 - not really giving you anything worth of
02:23 - value just my worthless respect so
02:25 - anyways so the basics is this we start
02:28 - at one and we're going to loop as long
02:30 - as it's less than ten but you're saying
02:32 - all right Bucky
02:33 - well our variable is just going to be
02:36 - stuck at one the whole time so this is
02:37 - going to keep repeating forever well if
02:40 - we ran it like this then yes it would
02:41 - keep repeating forever that's why we
02:44 - need to increment X slowly so let's go
02:46 - ahead and add one X each time by using
02:48 - that shortcut we learned X plus plus and
02:51 - now let's go ahead and save it run it
02:53 - and see what happens actually let me add
02:55 - a space right there and there we go
02:58 - so it says how do you like them apples
03:01 - nine different times so check it out we
03:05 - started at one so that's why our loop
03:07 - started at one if we started at six it
03:09 - was 36 but we didn't we started at one
03:12 - so the first time X was equal to one it
03:15 - ran the bit of code the next time X was
03:17 - equal to ran the bit of code and it did
03:20 - this all the way down until it got to
03:22 - nine x equals nine I'm going to run this
03:24 - bit of code now the next time after this
03:27 - X actually changed to ten so then this
03:30 - while loop took a look at it and says
03:32 - all right it's ten less than ten no 10
03:35 - is not less than 10 10 is equal than 10
03:38 - is equal to 10 so therefore I'm not
03:41 - going to run this bit of code because
03:42 - you only told me to run it when it's
03:44 - less than 10 so that is why you don't
03:47 - see 10 how do you like them apples 11 12
03:50 - 13 or anything like that
03:51 - that's why I stopped at 9 so anyways
03:53 - that's the basics of the while loop
03:54 - again it's pretty much the same as the
03:57 - for loop in these examples the only
03:59 - difference is instead of having this and
04:01 - this and this all in the parentheses
04:06 - right here there
04:07 - kind of spaced out and I kind of like it
04:09 - this way it makes it easier to see keep
04:10 - track of your variables and keep track
04:13 - where you're incrementing so anyways
04:15 - that's all I have for you guys for this
04:17 - tutorial um yeah sorry wish I had some
04:20 - more valuable information but I'm
04:22 - probably going to go take a mucinex and
04:24 - cough up guys let me say this for those
04:29 - of you guys who want to be grossed out
04:31 - listen to the rest of the story but for
04:34 - those of you guys who are just here for
04:35 - JavaScript education and for the
04:39 - information I'm not going to say any
04:41 - information so you can move on to next
04:43 - tutorial but so that's your warning but
04:45 - for you guys who stuck around let me
04:47 - tell you this all right this morning
04:49 - this morning I was like coughing and
04:52 - coughing and I like nothing was coming
04:55 - out you know how like the phlegm is just
04:57 - stuck in your throat and it's annoying
04:58 - that you can't get it out no matter how
05:00 - hard he cough so I took him using XDM
05:02 - because that kind of loosens stuff up
05:04 - and then about thirty minutes later I
05:06 - like sucked in like and I coughed like
05:09 - as hard as I can in this huge glob I was
05:11 - like the size to grapes of it look it
05:15 - looked like oatmeal and I don't know
05:16 - where in my body it came from but it was
05:18 - the most disgusting looking thing
05:20 - coughed up in my sink so I mean I
05:24 - shouldn't have even told you guys but
05:25 - hey I warned it so anyways anyways thank
05:30 - you guys for watching and listening my
05:31 - story of Anna yeah I guess I'll see you
05:33 - guys in the next video
