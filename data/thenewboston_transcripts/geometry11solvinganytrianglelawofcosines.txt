00:01 - okay so today we're talking about how to
00:04 - solve the sides of a triangle or the
00:08 - angle of a triangle using What's called
00:11 - the law of
00:12 - cosiness so in any triangle a
00:18 - BC a s which is the length of this side
00:22 - equals b^2 + c^ 2 - 2 b c cosine of a
00:28 - and remember cosine is is a trig
00:30 - function so we're going to have to use
00:32 - our graphing calculator that has a
00:35 - cosine function on it it looks like it
00:39 - just it looks like this and you're going
00:41 - to put an answer in here and you're
00:43 - going to close the parentheses when
00:45 - we're solving for
00:47 - that b^2 = a 2 + c^2 - 2 a c cosine of B
00:54 - c^2 = a 2 + b^ 2 - 2 a cosine of C so B
01:00 - basically the length of a side is equal
01:03 - to the
01:05 - sum
01:07 - of that
01:09 - side is equal to the sum of the other
01:12 - two sides minus
01:14 - 2 side one * side 2
01:18 - cosine of the angle across from that
01:22 - side I know it's kind of confusing but
01:24 - it's really actually pretty easy so
01:26 - we're going to do some examples
01:28 - now
01:30 - okay so we're trying to find out what x
01:34 - equals so X2 is going to
01:39 - equal a
01:41 - [Music]
01:43 - 2+ b
01:46 - 2 - 2
01:50 - a *
01:52 - B cosine of the angle opposite the one
01:57 - we're talk opposite the side we're
01:59 - talking about
02:00 - so cosine of
02:03 - 75 X2 is equal to and this is where
02:07 - we're going to have to start using the
02:09 - calculator so 15^
02:12 - SAR is
02:14 - 225 + 11^
02:17 - 2ar is
02:19 - 121 - 2 15 *
02:25 - 11 is
02:28 - 165 and we're not going to plug in
02:30 - cosine
02:32 - yet okay so 25 225 +
02:37 - 121 is
02:40 - 346
02:43 - minus 2 *
02:45 - 165
02:47 - 330 cine of
02:50 - 75 okay so this is where we have to plug
02:54 - stuff into the calculator so this is how
02:57 - it's going to look when you plug it into
02:59 - the calculator
03:00 - you're going to plug
03:02 - 346
03:03 - minus
03:05 - 330 cine of 75 just like this except
03:09 - there'll be a parentheses here and you
03:11 - want to close that parentheses too so
03:14 - let's go ahead and type that into the
03:16 - calculator 346 - 330 cine of 75 close
03:23 - the
03:23 - parentheses and rounding to the um
03:28 - second decimal place we're going to
03:32 - get x^2 is = to
03:39 - 26059 so now we want the length of X so
03:42 - we're going to take the square root of
03:44 - it and in your calculator if you hit
03:47 - second Square the squared button you'll
03:51 - get the square root and then if you hit
03:54 - second answer it'll plug that answer
03:57 - that you just got right back into it so
03:59 - it's more exact so then you you want to
04:02 - round at the very end so you get about
04:05 - 16.1
04:07 - 14279 we're going to round that to
04:10 - 16.1
04:12 - 43 it's always good to round to the
04:14 - third decimal
04:16 - place okay we're going to do one more
04:18 - example except this time we're going to
04:19 - find what that angle is so we're going
04:21 - to have to use some stuff called Arc
04:26 - cosine and Arc cosine is just like the
04:30 - opposite of doing cosine I'll show you
04:34 - what I mean in a minute so we're trying
04:36 - to solve for x so we have to take the
04:39 - side opposite x 11^ 2 = the two sides
04:47 - squared - 2 side * side cosine of
04:55 - x so we're going to get 121 = 5 2 is 25
05:00 - + 5 2 is 25 50 - 2 * 5 is 10 * 5 is 50
05:08 - cine of x^ SAR or no that should just be
05:12 - cosine of x so now what we're going to
05:15 - do is we're trying to solve for this so
05:17 - we're going to subtract 50
05:21 - over and you'll get 71 is equal to 50
05:26 - cosine of x we're going to divide the 50
05:32 - over and we're just going to leave it as
05:35 - a fraction for
05:36 - now equals cosine of x okay so when we
05:41 - don't know the value of an angle we're
05:45 - going to use the inverse we're going to
05:48 - use an inverse
05:50 - function so in order to find out what x
05:54 - equals we say x is equal to cosine in
05:59 - inverse of 71 over 50 so basically it's
06:03 - saying that this
06:06 - angle it this side of the equation is
06:09 - basically just saying whose angle has a
06:14 - cosign of 51
06:17 - over50 so when we do this we're solving
06:20 - for the
06:21 - angle so when you type it into your
06:23 - calculator you're going to hit second
06:26 - cosine and it when it when you you do
06:29 - that this will pop up this is what it
06:31 - should looks like look like and then
06:34 - you're going to plug in 71 / -50 close
06:39 - the
06:41 - parentheses
06:46 - and and if you type that into a
06:48 - calculator you'll get about
06:51 - 63Â° so that's all we're doing with law
06:55 - of cosiness make sure you come back and
06:57 - watch the next video where we're going
06:58 - to talk about of signs which is another
07:01 - way to
07:02 - solve problems about triangles
