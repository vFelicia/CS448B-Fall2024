00:00 - so we've got full stop as part of that
00:02 - whereas if we were not to specify this
00:06 - here it would only produce uh words
00:09 - themselves so we can specify words here
00:12 - or characters here if you like so I
00:14 - could say an Amber sand um and if I was
00:16 - to say
00:18 - um if I was say an amand and a full stop
00:21 - I'd say this is an example string and
00:24 - this is a tutorial uh you can see that
00:27 - when we
00:28 - refresh we we have um a few things so
00:31 - we've got this is an example string and
00:34 - so we've included that amband as a word
00:37 - uh now that we've specified it in here
00:39 - and also we've specified a full stop now
00:41 - you don't need any commas or anything
00:42 - for this they're just literally the
00:44 - symbols next to each other so I could
00:46 - put an ex exclamation mark for example
00:48 - an asteris anything I wanted just next
00:50 - to each other and you can also see the
00:52 - the full Stop's being included on the
00:54 - end there um inside tutorial uh again
00:57 - let's say separate that full stop and
00:59 - refresh
01:00 - and you can see that's been included as
01:02 - well so this is the string word count
01:04 - function and the many ways that you can
01:06 - use it we're now going to move on to
01:09 - String Shuffle uh so let's go ahead and
01:12 - uh get rid of this and let's change our
01:15 - string back to how it was okay so the
01:18 - String Shuffle uh function let's go
01:20 - ahead and say string uncore shuffled
01:24 - equals um it it is written like this so
01:27 - it's strr it's the same as U many string
01:30 - functions St strore Shuffle and we're
01:33 - only taking one argument here and that's
01:35 - just the string so we're taking in a
01:36 - string and what we're doing is we're
01:37 - shuffling it now I'll uh show you what
01:40 - this does when we preview it so we're
01:43 - echoing out our shuffled string and you
01:45 - can uh get an idea of what happens when
01:47 - I click refresh
01:49 - now okay so what it's actually done is
01:51 - it's just taken each character of the
01:53 - string and it's randomly shuffled it so
01:55 - let's keep refreshing and you can see
01:57 - that shuffling uh each time now why
02:00 - might this uh function be useful well uh
02:03 - in the past I've used it for let's say I
02:05 - was uploading a file and I wanted to
02:07 - give it a random generated name uh a
02:10 - great way to do this is to um actually
02:13 - use this St Str Shuffle to shuffle the
02:15 - file name of your file obviously without
02:18 - the jpeg extension or the PNG or
02:21 - whatever file you're uploading but you
02:22 - can always add that um extension on the
02:24 - end but String Shuffle uh is great for
02:27 - just randomly generating um you know
02:30 - some some text but giving it a sensible
02:33 - value as well so instead of say
02:35 - generating a massive random number or an
02:37 - md5 hash uh you can use this String
02:39 - Shuffle uh to shuffle some
02:42 - characters another really useful um way
02:45 - of uh well a useful uh use if you like
02:50 - for this function is let's just say our
02:52 - string was um a collection of um let's
02:55 - say letters and numbers so a b c d e f g
02:58 - h i j k l M N O P I won't bore you with
03:01 - the rest of the alphabet and then we
03:03 - could do 1 two or sorry 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
03:07 - 8 9 um what this is actually going to do
03:10 - is it's just going to generate a random
03:12 - sequence of letters and numbers so let's
03:14 - go ahead and refresh you can see that
03:16 - it's just generating a random sequence
03:19 - of letters and numbers again really good
03:21 - for a random randomization of um you
03:25 - know of say a file name or a forward
03:27 - slash say you had a website that creat
03:29 - created a shortened URL what you might
03:32 - want to do is say
03:34 - um string shuffled equals this Shuffle
03:37 - and then you might want to um actually
03:40 - um split this string in half so what we
03:44 - could do is we could come and say um
03:47 - what we could use the substring function
03:50 - so what we could say is um let's go down
03:52 - here so we could say um half is equal to
03:57 - substring using the substring function
03:59 - we're feeding in the
04:01 - string shuffled value um and then what
04:04 - we're doing is we are giving it the
04:06 - start and the mid value so this would be
04:09 - the string length of the string so this
04:13 - is equal to half of the length of the
04:16 - amount of you know characters or you
04:19 - could just simply say 10 for example if
04:21 - you wanted a 10 character 10 characters
04:23 - returned let's say five for now so we
04:25 - can see the difference let's refresh and
04:28 - you can see oh no what's happened here
04:30 - oh sorry yeah so um Echo half uh what
04:35 - we're actually doing is we're just uh
04:36 - returning a few characters so this is
04:39 - really good for a uh for a random
04:41 - character generation and in this example
04:43 - I've shown you String Shuffle and the
04:45 - substring function as well however here
04:48 - um you could say string length um of uh
04:52 - the
04:53 - string uh divided by uh sorry divided by
04:57 - two uh so that will cut this in half so
04:59 - we've got half of whatever is in our
05:01 - string up here so there's many ways you
05:03 - can do this obviously you can use
05:05 - different string functions with
05:06 - different string functions to create a
05:08 - really really nice effect for for you
05:11 - know useful things so that's the use of
05:13 - the String Shuffle it's really really
05:14 - nice way to use that uh
05:16 - function we also have something not
05:18 - similar to this but something that you
05:20 - may struggle to find use for um
05:23 - personally I've I've struggled to find
05:25 - use for this function and it's the uh St
05:27 - Str reverse function so let's go ahead
05:30 - and change this string
05:32 - to this is an example string for
05:37 - example um STL reverse and then we can
05:40 - Echo out
05:43 - string reversed uh let's go ahead and
05:46 - change our variable name
05:48 - here oh reversed so what we're doing is
05:52 - we're reversing the string using the
05:53 - string reverse function and then we're
05:55 - just echoing that out so let's go and
05:57 - have a look at that in our
05:58 - browser um pass everyone line seven so
06:01 - that's going to be me yep okay there we
06:03 - are
