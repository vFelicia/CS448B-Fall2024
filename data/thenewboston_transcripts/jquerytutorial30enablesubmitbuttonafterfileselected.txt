00:00 - so this takes the attribute value which
00:02 - will be C colon backslash fake path and
00:04 - then the image I choose so if I click on
00:06 - that you can see you've got C colon
00:08 - backslash fake path backslash Tarson jpg
00:12 - so now that we know that this well I
00:15 - mean that was sort of some useless
00:17 - information I guess in sense of the
00:19 - tutorial but the reason that this change
00:22 - event handler works is because the value
00:24 - attribute is added so as long as you
00:27 - know that you'll understand why we
00:29 - actually are using this event handler
00:30 - but overall the you know the notation of
00:33 - change is quite you know easy to
00:35 - understand so now what we want to do is
00:38 - go ahead and change this submit button
00:41 - so with the idea of submit we're going
00:43 - to reference it as hash submit we want
00:45 - to remove this attribute here so the
00:48 - first way we can do it is change the
00:50 - attribute or we could go ahead and
00:51 - remove it so I'll show you both and you
00:54 - can decide which one you think would be
00:56 - better okay so once the file has changed
00:59 - we want to select submit and then we
01:03 - want to say attribute disabled none so
01:10 - this will change the value of the
01:12 - attribute name disabled to nothing so
01:15 - let's just go ahead and look at that
01:17 - let's click choose file and let's choose
01:20 - tartan dot jpg bear in mind this upload
01:22 - button is still or this upload submit
01:25 - button is still disabled when I click it
01:27 - and nothing's happened so let's check
01:29 - check what might have happened so hash
01:32 - submit to attribute okay so I think
01:35 - perhaps we we might not be able to
01:37 - actually use this so let's go ahead and
01:39 - use remove attribute instead and here we
01:42 - just specify the name of the attribute
01:44 - to be removed so disabled let's go ahead
01:47 - and try that again I'm going to click
01:49 - Choose file click Tartan jpg and you see
01:52 - that the attribute for this upload
01:54 - button has been removed and therefore it
01:57 - we can now click it and submit our file
02:00 - so that's the first way that we can go
02:03 - ahead and do it by submitting individual
02:07 - IDs now what happens if you always had
02:11 - an input file here
02:13 - like an input type file and you always
02:15 - had a submit button afterwards now you
02:18 - could go ahead and set up your form like
02:21 - this you could even set it up without
02:24 - disabled like this and you can have
02:27 - jQuery automatically do this all for you
02:30 - so let's go ahead and just get rid of
02:32 - this here now let's just assume that
02:35 - like I said if you are regular regularly
02:39 - including as part of your page on any
02:42 - page on your website an input type of
02:44 - file and an input submit type as well
02:48 - now let's just like I said assume that
02:53 - we are doing that we're going to use a
02:55 - general selector to select all input
02:58 - fields with the type file so let's go
03:01 - ahead and use a selector so it's an
03:03 - input selector this would select all
03:05 - input fields but this time I want to
03:08 - specify a type inside of here which is
03:11 - file so now I can say dot next and
03:15 - essentially what this will be doing is
03:17 - it will select this file here and the
03:20 - next will be this next element here so I
03:23 - can say any element after this I next
03:27 - I'm going to change the attribute or
03:29 - create the attribute disabled to equal
03:32 - disabled so at the moment this input
03:37 - submit button doesn't contain a disabled
03:39 - attribute however once we've selected
03:41 - any file or the next submit button after
03:45 - this will be you know will be given this
03:48 - disabled attribute so that's now refresh
03:50 - and you can see that that button has
03:52 - been automatically disabled so any input
03:55 - of the type submit' or any any element
03:58 - essentially after this will be disabled
04:01 - ie our button so now what we can do is
04:05 - come down to
04:07 - well we actually would append it back
04:09 - onto here so I can say dot change or
04:13 - sorry dot I think we would have to dot
04:16 - dot previous dot change and then in here
04:20 - we can create a callback function in
04:25 - actual fact let's change this around all
04:27 - together I'm going to go ahead and I'm
04:30 - going to say I'm just going to get rid
04:35 - of this and I'm going to say dot change
04:37 - now as we did before we appended this
04:39 - event handler on but now after this I'm
04:42 - going to add this and now in here I can
04:44 - go ahead and create my function so let
04:46 - me just run along I'm just going to pull
04:48 - that down and I'll just explain what's
04:50 - happening so we select our input type we
04:53 - append an event handler onto it
04:54 - but while we're doing that we select the
04:56 - next element remember the submit button
04:58 - and we give it that attribute so it's
05:01 - still worked as you can see but we can
05:05 - apply an event handler here as well for
05:07 - example alert changed when we go ahead
05:11 - and change something here we get this
05:14 - alert box up so we know that that works
05:16 - now so as well as an pending on an event
05:19 - handler we've also selected the next
05:21 - element and disabled it okay so now
05:24 - inside of here we want to go ahead and
05:26 - enable this once it changes so now all
05:30 - we'll have to do is say this dot next
05:34 - dot remove attribute
05:41 - disabled so once this element here
05:44 - that's been selected ie all file types
05:46 - across our page have changed the next
05:49 - element along which is currently
05:51 - disabled we remove the attribute now it
05:53 - may look like oh okay well once this
05:56 - event takes place we're then going ahead
05:58 - and removing the attribute but then with
06:01 - you know disabling it this change
06:03 - function or this change event only
06:05 - happens once it's changed this happens
06:09 - regardless it will even though the
06:11 - change event handlers before this will
06:13 - always happen so we won't get the
06:15 - problem that it will be reduce abled for
06:17 - example so I'm going to go ahead and
06:19 - choose two Tartan jpg and you can see
06:21 - that the upload button has been enabled
06:23 - so that's just a quick bit of
06:26 - information or a long bit of information
06:28 - but in detail about how we can use this
06:30 - we went for the ID selection before and
06:34 - now we've used this input type file
06:36 - selection and this would work globally
06:38 - across your script as long as you had an
06:40 - input type with or an input field with
06:42 - the type file and an input type with the
06:44 - type input field with the type submit'
06:46 - so this will now work globally doing it
06:48 - this way however if you're only doing
06:50 - this once off you can apply an ID or a
06:53 - class and select it that way
