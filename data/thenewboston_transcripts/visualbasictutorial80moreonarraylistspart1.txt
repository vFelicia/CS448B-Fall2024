00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - taking a closer look at arrays and what
00:09 - you can do with arrays so just go ahead
00:10 - or not erase array lists my Ben we go
00:14 - ahead and go to new project will shrink
00:17 - this down a little bit we'll select
00:18 - windows forms application and we will
00:20 - title it array lists go ahead and hit OK
00:24 - and wait for that to load so we're just
00:28 - going to go ahead and add two things to
00:30 - our form we will add a button and a list
00:35 - box now the list box we're just going to
00:38 - use that to print out the items in our
00:40 - array so in this tutorial we're going to
00:47 - be focusing more on the code and not the
00:50 - form so string that down and we'll set
00:54 - some names for this and then we'll be
00:55 - done with the form so we'll go ahead and
00:59 - set the name of list box 1 to list array
01:03 - list and we'll set the name for button 1
01:06 - to button list items and we will set the
01:10 - text to display array list okay so now
01:19 - I'll go ahead and view the code for
01:22 - display array list and so we created an
01:25 - event that will run whenever button list
01:28 - items is clicked so let's come up here
01:30 - and we will create an array list so
01:33 - let's go ahead and type private and now
01:35 - we're going to have to set a name for
01:37 - our array list so we'll just call it my
01:42 - array list as and then we'll use the new
01:46 - keyword to create an object of a rain
01:48 - list so now that we have an array list
01:50 - let's go ahead and add something to it
01:53 - so we can do this by using the add sub
01:58 - so we'll just type my array list dot add
02:04 - then we'll go ahead add an integer
02:06 - 10
02:08 - now let's go ahead and cut that and
02:14 - we'll double click on form 1 so with the
02:16 - form 1 loads it will add this to my
02:18 - array list let's go ahead and get rid of
02:21 - some of this white space right here so
02:24 - we can also add strings to my ArrayList
02:27 - so my ArrayList add hello and let's
02:33 - close that in for them and then we can
02:35 - add decimals to it too so my latest add
02:40 - 10 point or 1 point 3 4 so if we come up
02:45 - here and click button list items let's
02:49 - go ahead and add some code that will
02:51 - display all the stuff in my rayleigh my
02:53 - ArrayList so we'll just use a for each
02:55 - loop here so for each item as string in
03:02 - my ArrayList go ahead and do this now
03:06 - you don't always have to use the name
03:07 - item that's just what I'm using you can
03:11 - name it whatever you want and we use
03:12 - type string in here because we're going
03:15 - to be converting each one of these to a
03:16 - string before we print it out inside of
03:19 - our list box and then in my ArrayList so
03:21 - we'll type list array list dot items and
03:26 - we're going to put item dot to string so
03:31 - it will convert 10 to a string it'll
03:34 - convert hello to a string which is
03:35 - already a string and it will convert
03:37 - 1.34 to a string so let's go ahead and
03:40 - run this and do over there if we click
03:45 - display array list we get 10 hello and
03:48 - 1.34 so this is just how you add stuff
03:53 - to ArrayList of any data type you want
03:56 - you can even do it of objects of classes
03:58 - structures enumerations whatever you
04:02 - want you can add to your ArrayList and
04:03 - it has no bounds now you can set bounds
04:07 - and we're going to be learning about
04:07 - that in the next tutorial so I'm
04:10 - practice a little bit with ArrayList and
04:12 - once you've got those down go ahead and
04:14 - move on to the next tutorial and we're
04:15 - going to be learning more about what you
04:16 - can do with ArrayList so thanks for
04:18 - watching guys and stay tuned for the
04:19 - next tutorial
04:20 - you
