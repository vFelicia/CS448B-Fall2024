00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:08 - talking about the get names method or
00:12 - function in system in the system
00:16 - namespace and the enum class now if you
00:18 - remember from the last tutorial we used
00:20 - get values in this tutorial we're using
00:23 - get names now it's not necessary that
00:25 - you know what we did in the last
00:26 - tutorial but it'll probably help you
00:28 - so other than get values there's get
00:32 - names and get name so we'll go ahead and
00:35 - just create a little demo for this now
00:38 - you can see that we have list enum names
00:40 - and we created that in the last tutorial
00:41 - for a purpose so we're going to list the
00:44 - names of the items in our enumeration so
00:48 - we're just going to use a for each loop
00:50 - for this so for each item as and since
00:57 - we're using the name we're going to go
00:59 - ahead and use string instead of integer
01:01 - because the items are a string so in and
01:05 - now we're going to use the system
01:07 - namespace dot enum dot get names now you
01:12 - can see there's get names and get name
01:14 - we're going to be using get names and we
01:16 - will talking about get names at I mean
01:18 - get name after this so now what we're
01:20 - going to do is we are going to get the
01:24 - type of sports so get type and sports
01:31 - and we'll go ahead and press enter and
01:33 - now what we're going to do is we're
01:35 - going to type list enum names items dot
01:41 - add and we'll add item and we don't need
01:44 - to convert that to a string because it
01:45 - already is a string so let's go ahead
01:49 - and run this and see what kind of
01:50 - results we get so let's go ahead and
01:55 - select sport we'll select a football and
01:58 - I'll say your sport is football we get
02:00 - the values which is 0 1 & 2 and the
02:04 - names which is baseball basketball and
02:06 - football and you can see that these
02:09 - match up to the corresponding values if
02:12 - we go ahead and
02:13 - grow up to the enumeration here and so
02:15 - the application you can see baseball is
02:17 - zero basketball is one and football is
02:21 - two now we can do this with any other
02:23 - value and it's going to give us the same
02:27 - results now you can see that it
02:29 - continues to add it to the list
02:30 - so we can go ahead and do make a simple
02:34 - fix for this so we'll come down here
02:35 - below combo sports and we'll type
02:38 - private sub clear lists clear list okay
02:43 - and inside this will just type list enum
02:49 - names dot items dot clear and lists in
02:54 - them values items dot clear so this is
03:00 - just going to clear the items and we
03:01 - need to call that each time button
03:03 - analyze this click and that needs to be
03:05 - the first thing so it doesn't clear it
03:07 - after the this stuff has been added so
03:11 - let's go ahead and run this and you can
03:13 - see that we can pick any sport let's do
03:16 - basketball this time analyze the sport
03:18 - it gives us the everything right here
03:22 - the names of the enumeration and the
03:25 - values inside of it and we can do
03:26 - football click analyze sport and we get
03:28 - the same things so now we can use what's
03:31 - called get name now what this does is
03:34 - instead of just getting all of the names
03:36 - of the enumeration we can get a single
03:38 - one so to do this we're going to use
03:41 - everything the same as we used for get
03:45 - names but instead of just having one
03:47 - argument we're going to need two so
03:51 - we're going to have the enum type and
03:54 - we're going to use get type of sport so
03:56 - it'll get the type for us and we need
03:58 - the value and the value would be either
04:01 - 0 1 or 2 so we can go ahead and let's
04:06 - say it will put the value 2 in so it's
04:08 - going to get the name of the value 2 in
04:12 - enumeration sports so if we run this
04:17 - we're going to go ahead and click
04:19 - football and we'll analyze sport
04:22 - and we get football right here now you
04:25 - can see that it prints out every single
04:29 - letter and now the reason it does this
04:32 - is because the name of it is split up
04:40 - into different parts now what we can do
04:43 - is we can declare a variable right here
04:46 - let's do well will declare a variable
04:50 - outside is so dim named as string and
04:57 - we'll just go ahead and do name plus
05:01 - equals item and now we'll we'll take
05:07 - this out here and do it after the for
05:09 - loop and we'll just add name instead of
05:15 - item and we'll just set this equal to
05:19 - nothing so it will quit complaining to
05:22 - us so now if we run this we can go ahead
05:27 - and analyze a sport so select one
05:30 - analyze sport and we get football so I'm
05:34 - go ahead work a little bit with get
05:36 - names and get name and once you got that
05:40 - down go ahead and move on to the next
05:42 - tutorial and thanks for watching
