00:00 - hello YouTube say I'm here from
00:02 - youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
00:04 - new boss tip and in this tutorial we're
00:06 - going to be talking more about
00:07 - namespaces now if you remember from the
00:10 - previous tutorial we created this people
00:12 - file right here people dot VB and inside
00:17 - of it we created two namespaces we have
00:19 - namespace other people and namespace
00:22 - friends and inside each one of these we
00:24 - have a class called people and you can
00:28 - see here that we have a class called
00:30 - people right there
00:30 - now the reason that these don't conflict
00:33 - with each other is because we have put
00:36 - them in two different namespaces so
00:38 - let's go ahead and come over here and we
00:42 - will add a button to our form one so
00:47 - we'll just make that bigger
00:50 - let's find two text boxes
00:59 - okay so we'll bring this button down
01:01 - we'll put the textbox is right
01:03 - underneath each other and then we'll
01:05 - label them first name and last name so
01:12 - for label one the text is going to be
01:15 - first name and for label to the text is
01:20 - going to be last name so last name okay
01:32 - so now what we'll do is we'll change the
01:34 - text for button one so we'll just click
01:37 - so we'll just type in show friend or
01:40 - let's just do show person and we will
01:46 - set the name values for each of these
01:48 - text boxes so text first name and text
01:54 - last name okay so now we'll open up our
02:00 - code for four more VB and you can see
02:03 - here that it generates the form one load
02:05 - of it now what we need to do is create
02:07 - an object of one of our people classes
02:10 - now for this one we'll just use the
02:13 - class people from the namespace other
02:16 - people we could also use the people from
02:18 - the namespace friends so let's come over
02:20 - here to form one dot VB and we need to
02:23 - create an object of that class so we
02:26 - will type private person as new and now
02:32 - whenever we're making a new person you
02:35 - can see that the people class is inside
02:37 - of the namespace other people so we have
02:39 - to specify the namespace and then we
02:41 - have to specify the class because we are
02:43 - using more than one namespace inside of
02:45 - our program so come up here and we want
02:49 - to declare person as new other people
02:54 - dot people
02:59 - okay so now we can do is type person dot
03:05 - first name over here when you leave that
03:10 - out of there we need to come to our
03:11 - button one event click so person dot
03:16 - first name equals text first name dot
03:20 - txt and person dot last name equals text
03:27 - last name dot txt and we'll just go
03:31 - ahead and show that in a message box so
03:34 - we will type person dot two string and
03:38 - you can see that we override the two
03:42 - string function in each one of these
03:43 - classes so that instead of converting
03:45 - our person object or a people object to
03:48 - a string it will just return their first
03:50 - name and their last name so let's go
03:53 - ahead and run this and see what happens
03:55 - so here's our first name let's shrink
03:59 - this down a bit so let's just do first
04:01 - name Jim last name Harris and we'll just
04:06 - go ahead and click show person and you
04:08 - can see that we get Jim Harris right
04:10 - here and he is of type people from the
04:15 - namespace other people so go ahead and
04:18 - if you have some programs that you've
04:20 - already made you could try organizing
04:23 - your classes inside of namespaces and or
04:26 - make this program right here and once
04:28 - you've done that go ahead and move on to
04:29 - the next tutorial
