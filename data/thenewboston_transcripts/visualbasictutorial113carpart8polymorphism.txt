00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:02 - slash on that gamer for the new Boston
00:04 - and in this tutorial we're gonna be
00:06 - talking about polymorphism now this is
00:09 - probably one of the scariest terms in
00:11 - programming but it's actually very
00:13 - simple and we'll be learning about it in
00:16 - this tutorial so come down here and
00:19 - let's do it run for the form one load
00:22 - sub will just create a method or a sub
00:26 - so private sub show car info and now
00:32 - what we want to do is we want to pass a
00:34 - car to the sub that we're creating so
00:40 - we'll just call it argument car as car
00:46 - or we'll do as all cars let's specify
00:50 - the name space dot car and we'll go
00:53 - ahead and hit enter now the reason we
00:56 - had to specify the name space is because
00:58 - that it is outside of the name space
01:00 - that is used for our project now if we
01:02 - didn't have this nested inside of a name
01:04 - space then we wouldn't have to specify
01:06 - that but since we do and we're going to
01:08 - have to specify it so whatever whenever
01:12 - they pass in the car to this method
01:15 - let's go ahead and show the info of it
01:18 - so we'll type our card dot to string
01:24 - we'll go ahead and minimize that let's
01:28 - come down here to button show car info
01:31 - and we will type show car info and we
01:38 - will pass default car to that now up
01:44 - here this is not going to do anything
01:46 - for us so we need to show that in a
01:48 - message box so a message box our show
01:51 - and we're going to convert that to a
01:53 - string and we'll just set the title to
01:56 - info we'll go ahead and close that off
02:01 - okay so now that we've shown the car
02:05 - info let's go ahead and run this and see
02:07 - what we get now let's go ahead and click
02:11 - show info we haven't set the name
02:13 - we get the car name we get the color red
02:15 - the number of doors 5 and the car speed
02:18 - is equal to zero now this all works as
02:20 - expected because we passed a car object
02:22 - to this it is called the two string
02:24 - function that is inside of this class
02:28 - right here which returns all the info we
02:31 - need about our car now let's go ahead
02:36 - and come to show car info instead of
02:39 - showing default car ledge so default
02:43 - sports car now we'll go ahead and run
02:46 - this now let's set the name of our
02:49 - sports car to Mustang GT 500 go ahead
02:53 - and click OK it will set the color to
02:55 - black doors is 2 we will accelerate it
03:01 - to 80 miles per hour we can look at the
03:05 - power-to-weight ratio which is default
03:09 - because we set that one form1 loads and
03:12 - now if we show info you can see that we
03:14 - get the name Mustang gt500 the car color
03:17 - is black the number of doors is 2 and
03:19 - the car speed is 80 now you might want
03:22 - you might be wondering to yourself why
03:24 - does this work well polymorphism
03:27 - basically means that you can create not
03:31 - create that you can use use one type as
03:38 - another type so if you have an object
03:40 - our car right here or the object that
03:44 - you pass to a default sports car that
03:45 - can be treated as a car object because
03:48 - they fall sports car the object that it
03:50 - has the class that comes from inherits
03:52 - from car now polymorphism it comes from
03:56 - the Greek word and it means many forms
03:59 - now you can you could pass a sports car
04:06 - to this and have it be used like a car
04:10 - but you cannot put sports car right here
04:15 - and pass a car to it because the car car
04:21 - does not inherit from sports cars so
04:23 - whatever sports car has in it
04:26 - Carr will not be able to use it so any
04:28 - stuff that you have defined yourself in
04:30 - sports car it's not available to card
04:32 - because it does not inherit it from
04:34 - sports car so I hope that gives you guys
04:40 - a basic understanding of polymorphism
04:43 - it's a quite simple concept and once
04:46 - you've used it a couple times you will
04:48 - get used to it so we'll just go ahead
04:50 - and do this one more time we can show
04:52 - the info and you can see that we get all
04:55 - the stuff we need and we don't get any
04:56 - errors even though it passed a sports
04:59 - car object to a a method that uses a car
05:03 - argument so go ahead
05:05 - type this corner if you have in practice
05:07 - a little bit with polymorphism you can
05:09 - create classes parent classes and
05:11 - subclasses and once you got that down go
05:14 - ahead and we watch in the next tutorial
