00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:04 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:07 - this tutorial we're going to be taking a
00:09 - look at passing array parameters so if
00:13 - you remember from from the previous
00:15 - tutorials we were making an application
00:17 - that dealt with arays so let's go ahead
00:19 - and open that back up so you you should
00:21 - see it in your recent projects if not
00:24 - you can come up to file open project or
00:28 - you can open the file so let's go ahead
00:32 - and zoom in some
00:34 - here now if you can see here that we
00:36 - have button reverse button sort array
00:39 - and button add array so what we want to
00:43 - do is um fix a couple things here and
00:47 - make our code a little bit better now if
00:50 - you noticed that if you run the program
00:52 - and click sort array it'll freeze up and
00:56 - crash because the argument cannot be
00:58 - null basically what this means is not
01:01 - all of the values in your array have
01:02 - been or not all the indexes have been
01:04 - set to a value so what we can do is we
01:09 - will come in here and we'll double click
01:11 - on form
01:12 - one and now we'll come up here and find
01:15 - these lines of code that assign values
01:17 - to each item in string classes and we're
01:19 - just going to go ahead and cut those out
01:23 - and then we'll go ahead and add them to
01:24 - the form one load so basically what this
01:27 - does is once the form opens the every
01:30 - single index of the array has been set
01:32 - to a value and we won't have to worry
01:34 - about that okay so now you can see we
01:37 - have a for each Loop in each one of
01:41 - these um button handlers now there's an
01:46 - easier way to do this we can make a sub
01:49 - that will do this for us and to do this
01:51 - we're going to need to pass an array as
01:53 - a
01:54 - parameter so we'll go ahead and come
01:57 - down to right under clear
02:01 - list and we will start off by creating a
02:04 - private sub so private
02:08 - sub and then we'll just call this add
02:11 - items to list and now for our arguments
02:15 - we're going to go ahead and type by
02:20 - Val um ARG
02:24 - array as
02:27 - string so you can see it'll
02:29 - automatically in the sub for us so
02:31 - whenever we call add items to list we're
02:34 - going to it's going to be required that
02:35 - we pass an array to it because we have
02:38 - these parentheses right here which tells
02:40 - the compiler compiler that this is an
02:42 - array so now what we need to do is um
02:46 - enumerate the
02:49 - array so we'll go ahead and use a for
02:52 - each Loop so for
02:55 - each item as string in ARG
03:01 - array we're going to go ahead and add
03:04 - that to the list so we'll just go ahead
03:06 - and comment this so add array item to
03:11 - list and we'll just type list arrays.
03:15 - items. add and for the arguments we'll
03:18 - just add
03:19 - item okay so now we can just go ahead
03:21 - and minimize this here and we can also
03:24 - minimize clear list because we're not
03:25 - going to be changing that now we'll come
03:28 - up here to our button at array
03:30 - and we're going to take out this for
03:31 - each Loop so now we're only going to
03:34 - need two things two things in button ad
03:36 - array so we'll just go ahead and type
03:40 - add items
03:43 - to list and for our arguments we're
03:47 - going to type string
03:51 - classes and we're going to need
03:53 - parentheses because it is an
03:58 - array
04:00 - or never mind we aren't going to need
04:01 - those we just need to put in string
04:03 - classes and the compiler U already knows
04:06 - that it's an array so we can go ahead
04:09 - and do this for each of the other subs
04:13 - and for these we're only going to need
04:14 - three
04:15 - lines so we can just go ahead and type
04:18 - add items to list string classes and we
04:22 - can do that one more time for button
04:28 - reverse
04:31 - so add items to list and string
04:36 - classes now if we go ahead and run this
04:39 - you can see that we get add array
04:41 - element sort array and reverse array and
04:43 - when we click on this it will add them
04:44 - to it we can also sort the array and
04:47 - reverse the array and you can see that
04:49 - everything works
04:51 - fine now I taught you how to pass um
04:55 - arrays as arguments but there's also
04:57 - something that you really need to get
04:58 - from this tutorial
05:00 - is that you can create subs or functions
05:03 - that will do stuff for you and it'll
05:06 - keep you from having to type a lot of
05:08 - excess code so by creating add items to
05:11 - list we only needed to make one for each
05:14 - Loop and we had the argument right here
05:17 - if we didn't we would have to have a for
05:18 - each Loop for each one of these subs and
05:21 - this makes it easier so that you don't
05:23 - have to write so much code and copy and
05:25 - pasting is always bad because you're
05:27 - probably going to forget something and
05:29 - you'll find that Happ happening to you a
05:30 - lot if you copy and paste so um go ahead
05:35 - and create a couple functions or subs
05:38 - and pass arrays to them um you can do
05:41 - whatever you want with them once they're
05:42 - in that sub um and then once you know
05:44 - how to do that and you're not going to
05:45 - forget it go ahead and move on to the
05:47 - next tutorial and thanks for
05:50 - watching
