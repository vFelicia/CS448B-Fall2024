00:00 - so we say if MySQL num rows of query
00:07 - that we've run so query run equals zero
00:13 - then we need to return true remember
00:18 - we're taking a return value of true so
00:21 - we can use this function later in an if
00:23 - statement else if MySQL num rows query
00:31 - run equals one return in fact I've got
00:39 - this the wrong way around so if it does
00:41 - equal zero return false if it equals one
00:44 - return true so if if the if we get a
00:48 - value back then we're returning true so
00:51 - the IP address already exists now this
00:53 - is slightly flawed what if the same ip
00:56 - address exists in the database now we
00:59 - could say is e greater than or equal to
01:02 - one which would be better we don't need
01:04 - to do this because our processing later
01:06 - on in the program is going to allow us
01:08 - to only add the IP address if it already
01:10 - exists or if it doesn't exist
01:12 - so if MySQL num rows query run equals
01:15 - zero return false the IP address does
01:18 - not exist
01:18 - else if MySQL num rows of query run a
01:21 - greater than or equal to one then we
01:23 - return true because the IP address does
01:25 - exist now there's a faster way to do
01:27 - this because what we need to do is we're
01:30 - running the MySQL num rows function
01:32 - twice so we're slowing down the speed of
01:34 - our program very slightly but you know
01:37 - significantly in terms of if you had a
01:39 - lots of lots of SQL you'd be overloading
01:43 - a server so I'm going to say query and
01:46 - num rows equals I'm just going to take
01:51 - this here
01:53 - and put it into a variable itself so
01:56 - we're only running this once and then
01:58 - what we can do is delete this as well
02:00 - and say query nun Rose query nun rose
02:07 - that's just a little tip when you're
02:09 - using lots of lots and lots of things
02:11 - like this don't include these in if
02:13 - statements or anywhere else or in any
02:15 - loops create them in a in a separate
02:19 - variable first so now let's check if
02:22 - this works so down here we can say if IP
02:27 - exists and then we specify a user IP in
02:30 - here do something otherwise do something
02:34 - else
02:34 - so if IP exists remember we're supplying
02:38 - user ID this will be equal to one to
02:40 - seven dot dot dot one if it exists echo
02:45 - exists otherwise echo doesn't exist
02:53 - I've used my escaping character because
02:57 - I've used a a single quotation mark
03:00 - inside a single quotation mark let's
03:03 - refresh the page and see what happens
03:06 - exists now this is telling me that my
03:09 - current IP exists in the database which
03:11 - it does now let's delete that from there
03:14 - manually come back to the page and
03:18 - refresh and it says doesn't exist so our
03:21 - program is working this if statement
03:24 - here we've used the use of a function so
03:27 - we haven't had to program anything
03:29 - before other than functions and this is
03:31 - creating our code to look a lot tidier a
03:34 - lot neater and it's going to work a lot
03:36 - efficiently a lot more efficiently when
03:38 - we're looking at it and producing the
03:40 - final code so now we've got everything
03:42 - we need all we need to do is we need to
03:46 - perform this if statement and we need to
03:50 - just say if the IP doesn't exist then
03:54 - increase the counter so we can just use
03:57 - the exclamation mark before this
03:59 - function if IP doesn't exist we can just
04:03 - echo out
04:04 - and this will now add count last one so
04:10 - now what we can say is refresh this will
04:13 - now add count plus one because our IP
04:15 - address is not in the table so obviously
04:18 - we're not going to be occurring this
04:19 - Alice just to represent what's going to
04:21 - happen so our IP address doesn't exist
04:23 - what do we need to do we need to add the
04:27 - IP address and update the count so all
04:30 - we simply do is update Cal and add IP or
04:36 - is it IP add yep IP add user IP and
04:44 - that's it this line has incorporated our
04:48 - three front or this block of or this
04:51 - piece of code what other has
04:52 - incorporated our three functions and
04:54 - it's put them it's it's first of all
04:57 - made a check using a function then it's
05:01 - updated the count using a function and
05:03 - then it's added our IP address so now
05:06 - let's check if this works I'm going to
05:08 - add just a header down here just to make
05:11 - everything look pretty well not pretty
05:14 - but just so we know that there's content
05:15 - on our page so let's look at the
05:17 - database hits count currently is equal
05:21 - to zero and hits IP currently doesn't
05:23 - have any rows in you can see that I've
05:26 - got this like red little white arrow
05:28 - with a red circle around it so now let's
05:30 - refresh the page we've got my page up
05:32 - now because my IP doesn't already exist
05:35 - in the database we should have updated
05:37 - the count and added my IP in ready for
05:39 - the next check when I come on to the
05:41 - page again so hits IP we can see that
05:45 - we've got my IP address being inserted
05:47 - into the database and hits count will it
05:49 - be updated by one now let's refresh the
05:52 - page again that's done let's return here
05:55 - hits count is still equal to one and my
05:58 - IP address is already in the database so
06:02 - what we've done is we've used three
06:04 - different functions so we kept our code
06:06 - nice and tidy and what we've then done
06:09 - is we've checked if an IP exists we've
06:11 - added we've created some code or some
06:14 - SQL to insert and I
06:17 - and we've also created some code to
06:19 - update the count value now like I said
06:22 - before this isn't the quickest and
06:23 - easiest way to do this but the amount of
06:26 - time we've spent developing certain
06:28 - parts of it means that you know exactly
06:30 - how to do things a long way around
06:32 - therefore when it comes to working the
06:35 - short way around you'll be absolutely
06:36 - fine handling it
