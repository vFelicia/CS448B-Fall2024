00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:02 - and this is a video tutorial for the new
00:04 - Boston now we've looked at in previous
00:07 - videos at using the slide down and the
00:10 - slide up functionality in jQuery however
00:13 - we also have a slide toggle function
00:16 - this works the same as toggle on its own
00:18 - but in actual fact slides instead of
00:22 - just shows and hides an element so we're
00:24 - going to use an example of an image
00:26 - again I'm going to create an an image
00:30 - tag and I'm using this image called
00:33 - Tartan jpg I'm going to give it an alt
00:36 - attribute of just Tartan and I'm also
00:39 - going to give it an ID and let's do this
00:43 - just start here so I'm going to say ID
00:46 - is equal to image I'm going to have a
00:49 - button just up here so an input type and
00:52 - that's going to be button the value is
00:55 - going to be we'll just a toggle that
00:59 - makes certain that makes sense and I'm
01:01 - going to give this an ID as well this is
01:04 - just going to be toggle okay so I'll
01:07 - just finally surround this in paragraph
01:09 - tags and to make everything a bit more
01:11 - separate and then let's go over to our
01:15 - browser and preview it okay so we've got
01:18 - this image here and we've got toggle so
01:20 - what we want to happen is we want this
01:21 - to slide up and slide down every time we
01:25 - press this toggle button so we've
01:27 - already included jQuery and already
01:29 - included our effects j/s file now what
01:32 - we want to is to do is listen out for an
01:35 - event when this button is clicked then
01:38 - what we want to do is toggle this image
01:40 - accordingly so over in FX jes let's go
01:43 - ahead and create an event handler for
01:46 - this button which I have called toggle
01:49 - I'm going to say dot click so we're
01:52 - listening out for a click and inside we
01:54 - create a function that's going to be run
01:56 - when we have that click take place so
02:00 - everything inside the curly brackets is
02:01 - our code let's just bring that down to
02:04 - make it look a bit neater and let's go
02:06 - ahead and use the toggle function the
02:09 - slides toggle function
02:11 - so we are sliding the image so we need
02:14 - to reference the image with a hash image
02:16 - again using the standard notation to
02:18 - reference an element then we want to use
02:22 - the slide toggle function so the slide
02:26 - toggle function does take additional
02:27 - parameters I'll explain those in just a
02:29 - moment however let's return to our page
02:32 - and see what we have let's click on
02:34 - toggle you can see that that has slid up
02:38 - into the corner
02:39 - when we click toggle again it will slide
02:42 - back now you'll notice that as the image
02:45 - slid it actually slid into the corner
02:47 - and what the well the effect that we
02:50 - were actually looking for is sliding
02:51 - upwards and downwards and the problem
02:54 - with this is because we're using an
02:56 - image the effect doesn't have the same
02:58 - output therefore what we need to do is
03:01 - we need to include our image inside of
03:03 - somewhere and instead of actually
03:06 - sliding the image itself slide what is
03:09 - containing it so instead of the ID being
03:13 - inside of the image we're going to give
03:16 - it to this paragraph just here so the
03:19 - page is displayed in exactly the same
03:21 - way however all we've done is we've
03:23 - actually called the paragraph ID image
03:26 - story rather than the image itself now
03:29 - what's going to happen is we're going to
03:31 - get the same thing happen with this with
03:33 - referencing image which is now a
03:35 - paragraph and we're using slide toggle
03:37 - as we would normally but this time we'll
03:39 - actually retrieve or or display and a
03:43 - real sliding effect so you can see now
03:45 - that it's lit up and slid back down
03:47 - again so that's the problem with using
03:50 - some elements some elements won't
03:52 - display properly when you try and use
03:54 - animation effects on them however just
03:56 - by creating a paragraph with this image
03:58 - inside we've retrieved a perfect sliding
04:01 - effect now we do have other options for
04:04 - this slide toggle function for example
04:06 - the speed again it can be a texture or
04:08 - numerical representation of a speed for
04:11 - example we could do 2000 you also can
04:14 - change the animation type so for example
04:17 - at the moment it sort of bounces almost
04:19 - it swings it's hard to see when it
04:22 - slides fast however if we were to
04:25 - now you can see that it slows down just
04:27 - before it reaches the end here we can
04:30 - use Linea in this case to slide exactly
04:34 - so it maintain the same speed as its
04:36 - slides so if you watch now it maintains
04:39 - exactly the same speed as it slides up
04:42 - and down so it depends on what kind of
04:44 - effect you're looking for but by default
04:46 - this is swing and the other option and
04:49 - the only other option is linear we can
04:52 - also have a callback function which
04:54 - we've discussed in other parts of other
04:56 - tutorials which I won't be demonstrating
04:59 - in this case however for now that's T
05:01 - how to use the slide toggle function in
05:04 - jQuery
