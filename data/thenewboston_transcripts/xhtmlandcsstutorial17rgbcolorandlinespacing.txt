00:00 - what's up guys welcome to your 17 XHTML
00:03 - and CSS tutorial and in this tutorial
00:05 - I'm gonna be building a basic website
00:07 - and applying some sweet CSS properties
00:10 - through it so let's go ahead and get
00:11 - started and build just a starter quickl
00:14 - website um put a header at the top h1 h1
00:20 - and make this website
00:22 - Bucky's bacon wagon just imagine a wagon
00:26 - with a bunch of bacon in it and there
00:28 - you go and now let's just go ahead and
00:30 - add paragraph actually tighten that up a
00:33 - bit that's what she said and we'll just
00:35 - add one paragraph that's good enough for
00:37 - now and we'll just put like best on this
00:40 - side of the best bacon on this side of
00:45 - the Mississippi explanation point and
00:47 - space so let's go ahead and make a copy
00:51 - this and you know we just need some text
00:53 - so just fill that in like that so we
00:55 - have actually a paragraph that's more
00:57 - than one line so we have a header h1 and
01:01 - a paragraph so if you save that and
01:03 - looked at it right now here is what we
01:05 - have but this website although you know
01:08 - the idea is good a bacon wagon sounds
01:10 - like a pretty good idea the website
01:12 - needs some work so let's go ahead and
01:14 - let's change the color of this and also
01:17 - make this a little more readable so what
01:20 - I want to do first is we need to add
01:22 - that style sheet that we talked about
01:23 - last time so style equals or excuse me
01:28 - I'm getting ahead of myself
01:29 - type equals text slash CSS and remember
01:35 - you also need the ending style tag now
01:39 - everything in between here is going to
01:41 - be you know one of the rules so the
01:43 - first thing we want to work with is that
01:45 - header I mean this plain black header I
01:48 - mean we can do better than that
01:50 - so let's go ahead and make a rule to
01:51 - change the color on that so the element
01:54 - we're working with is h1 and in our
01:57 - curly braces the property that we want
01:59 - to change its color now before I told
02:02 - you guys that you can just make it
02:04 - something like red and that's good
02:07 - so let's go ahead and refresh this and
02:10 - now it's read what you're saying well
02:12 - everyone has read on their webpage I
02:14 - want mine to be a little different I
02:15 - want mine to be the color of bacon so
02:18 - what you can use aside from just
02:21 - keywords like red blue green is you can
02:24 - actually use something called an RGB
02:26 - value now if you don't have Photoshop
02:28 - because that's where I use mine you can
02:31 - go to pretty much than any website or go
02:34 - to google and type in RGB values and it
02:37 - will give you a list RGB values but
02:38 - whenever I'm looking for a specific
02:40 - color on my website here's what I do I
02:43 - go in the Photoshop and I click this
02:46 - thing called a color picker and I make
02:48 - sure that I'm working with only web
02:50 - colors and I can scroll down to the
02:53 - color that I'm looking for and highlight
02:58 - over it and then I just copy this and
03:01 - this is the RBG value on that stands for
03:05 - red blue and green
03:06 - so what I want to stress is not only do
03:10 - you have to use key words but you can
03:11 - also use RBG as well and anytime you do
03:14 - that you go ahead and put the pound sign
03:17 - and then paste that six digit color in
03:20 - there
03:21 - so now if we go ahead and save this and
03:23 - refresh it instead of red we get this
03:26 - brown dark brown cooked burnt and bacon
03:30 - looking color so that's a little better
03:32 - um again if you're just building a basic
03:35 - website then the keyword is fine but
03:38 - anytime you want like a really specific
03:39 - color then you need to use that RBG
03:42 - value so I just want to tell you guys
03:44 - that you have more options than you know
03:46 - just the colors you know in your head
03:48 - so aside from this I mean our Bucky's
03:53 - bacon wagon is looking Brown and looking
03:55 - pretty beautiful but you may say all
03:57 - right this paragraph right here this
03:59 - isn't really readable to the user
04:01 - maybe these lines are too close together
04:03 - or maybe you just want to space them out
04:05 - so we can fill this website a little
04:07 - better
04:08 - so anytime you want to space out the
04:10 - lines you need to use a property called
04:14 - line height so let's go ahead and first
04:16 - tell CSS that we're going to be working
04:18 - with our paragraph
04:19 - we'll do that by typing P and in our
04:22 - curly braces go ahead and type a line
04:25 - height as the property and now we can
04:29 - set this equal to a percentage by
04:31 - default it's a hundred percent right now
04:33 - so if you want to space them out a
04:35 - little bit go ahead and type like a
04:36 - hundred and thirty percent like that and
04:39 - now add your semicolon at the end let me
04:42 - save it and let me refresh this in front
04:44 - of you and you guys can see when i
04:46 - refresh what happens to the spacing let
04:48 - me refresh and I didn't save it or
04:52 - something aligned height one hundred and
04:54 - thirty percent it looks good and okay
04:58 - I'm also like okay let's try this one
05:03 - more time there we go so I changed it to
05:07 - 150% and as you can see the line height
05:10 - grew or well I mean I can't even explain
05:13 - it as well I can just show you so let me
05:16 - change this to like 170 170 is good
05:20 - enough and I'll show you guys one more
05:22 - time what happens right like that so
05:25 - what happens is you get more space in
05:28 - between your lines
05:29 - aka a line height so you know I'm not
05:32 - gonna explain you guys what line height
05:33 - means because I just showed you but
05:34 - anyways I usually like somewhere around
05:37 - 125 130 percent so I mean let me go
05:42 - ahead and refresh this and it makes it
05:44 - more readable than it did by just having
05:46 - a default paragraph so that is the
05:49 - basics of how to change color for
05:53 - remember take away from the story not
05:55 - only can you use you know just common
05:58 - colors like red blue green you can also
06:00 - use RBG value and last thing you can use
06:03 - something called a hexadecimal value I
06:05 - think that's how you say but don't ever
06:07 - use that because no one ever does that
06:08 - and again with line-height anytime you
06:12 - want to change the line height this is
06:14 - the property and change it to a
06:16 - percentage of different than what it is
06:19 - to make it more readable so that is two
06:22 - basic property values I want to show you
06:25 - guys and you know these might not be the
06:27 - most common properties that you want to
06:29 - change on your website but I just wanted
06:31 - to illustrate
06:32 - the point and I just wanted to go over
06:34 - CSS again so hopefully the idea of what
06:37 - element you want to change and what you
06:39 - want to change too is sticking in your
06:40 - head now so now that you understand this
06:43 - concept of basic style sheeting we can
06:46 - move on to the next tutorial so thank
06:48 - you guys for watching don't forget to
06:50 - watch the next tutorial and I guess I'll
06:52 - see you then
