00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' and
00:03 - welcome back to another PHP tutorial for
00:05 - the new Boston in this video we're going
00:07 - to be looking at object-oriented
00:08 - programming and I'm just briefly going
00:11 - to be explaining and demonstrating
00:13 - classes properties and methods so we're
00:16 - just going to be outlining a structure
00:18 - of a class that we're going to create so
00:20 - class is like our object we can do
00:25 - things with it and we can store
00:26 - different things inside of it we can
00:28 - also use and we can also interact other
00:30 - objects with other objects so for now
00:33 - let's just focus on creating a class
00:35 - creating some property or creating a
00:37 - property and a method inside of this
00:39 - class we're not going to be able to do
00:41 - anything with it at this point and but
00:44 - this should give you an insight on the
00:45 - skeleton outline of of creating a class
00:50 - so the first thing you do is use the
00:52 - class keyword and we need to give our
00:54 - class or our object a name so I'm going
00:56 - to call this bank account and you'll see
01:03 - that I've created it much like a
01:04 - function so I've got some parentheses in
01:07 - here and I've got some curly brackets in
01:14 - fact my mistake we don't actually need
01:16 - these parentheses in here that's for the
01:19 - method when we do declare our methods
01:21 - inside of our class so we've created our
01:24 - class now let's go over to our browser
01:29 - and refresh obviously nothing's happened
01:32 - at this point because we don't have any
01:34 - properties or methods inside of our
01:36 - class but we also don't have any output
01:38 - so there's no way at the moment we're
01:40 - outputting everything I'm just going to
01:42 - be refreshing to make sure that we don't
01:43 - have any errors as we go along so now
01:46 - we've created our class this class is
01:48 - called bank account so we've got a class
01:50 - called bank account now inside we might
01:53 - want to specify some different
01:54 - properties inside our arm inside of our
01:58 - class now properties are much like
02:00 - variables we can create them either
02:03 - variable so that we can change things
02:05 - with inside our class so we can change
02:07 - the properties of our class or we can
02:09 - create them static so we can create a
02:11 - static variable that way
02:13 - change so things like static variables
02:16 - you'd want to say things like the value
02:18 - of pi' in mathematics or for a variable
02:21 - you'd want to say the balance of a bank
02:23 - account so I'm going to use this example
02:25 - in here we are going to create a
02:29 - variable and then I'm going to tell you
02:31 - how we need to change this to either add
02:34 - to change the type of the property so
02:37 - let's say balanced and at the moment
02:39 - we'll equal it to zero let's say this
02:41 - bank account has just been opened so
02:43 - balance equals zero now there's
02:45 - something we need to add in the front
02:46 - and this is either a public a protected
02:52 - or a private so we make we change the
02:58 - visibility of this of this variable now
03:01 - public means that this can be accessed
03:03 - anywhere inside of your code protected
03:06 - means it can only be accessed within
03:08 - your class itself so methods can access
03:10 - it and private means that it can't be
03:13 - accessed and outside of the class
03:15 - whatsoever so protected in private a
03:18 - somewhat similar but we'll be going into
03:20 - the differences between them and why we
03:21 - should use them a bit later on so for
03:24 - now I'm just going to create the
03:25 - balances public so we can use it outside
03:28 - of our class just for example purposes
03:32 - so now what we've done is we've
03:35 - successfully created our class and we've
03:37 - successfully created a property within
03:40 - our class and this property is called
03:42 - balance and it's equal to zero so we've
03:44 - created an integer variable which is a
03:47 - property of bank account so we have a
03:50 - bank account and our balance now is zero
03:53 - for for this bank account so let's say
03:56 - under here we're not going to do this
03:58 - now but we wanted to create a new new
04:00 - bank account for someone as soon as we
04:03 - create a new instance of this class what
04:05 - we've automatically done is set the
04:06 - balance to zero and the methods are
04:09 - going to allow us to do things like show
04:11 - the balance and deposit and withdraw
04:16 - funds so let's go up here and let's
04:18 - create a new method now a method is
04:20 - structured somewhat like a function
04:22 - however we also give it a public
04:24 - protected private key word
04:27 - so I'm going to create this public as
04:29 - well I'm going to say public and we
04:31 - create exactly like we would do a
04:33 - function so we want to say so we say
04:37 - public and then we say function now now
04:44 - we give a name to our function as we
04:45 - usually with procedural PHP so public
04:49 - function and let's go for display
04:55 - balance we do exactly the same with the
04:59 - parentheses at the end and then our
05:01 - curly brackets or curly parenthesis now
05:04 - in here what we can do is we can I mean
05:08 - the idea of display balance would be to
05:10 - display the balance of the of the bank
05:13 - account so what we've done in this
05:15 - tutorial is we've looked at our overall
05:18 - class so the object bank account which
05:21 - we can later on reference and say yeah
05:23 - this is a new bank account create this
05:26 - into a variable and then we can start
05:28 - doing things with this and we can create
05:31 - a few instances of this because all we
05:33 - need to do is set each instance of this
05:36 - plus bank account into a new variable
05:38 - and then we can reuse the code so you'll
05:40 - start to see later on how useful this
05:42 - can actually be but for now we're going
05:44 - to be using this bank account example
05:46 - and we're going to create our methods
05:47 - and and change our balance dynamically
05:51 - as we call different methods inside of
05:56 - this class so this is the overall
05:58 - structure of a basic object we've got an
06:01 - object called bank account which is a
06:02 - class and we've got a balance inside
06:05 - which is a property and we've got a
06:07 - method called display balance so as long
06:10 - as you understand these terms later on
06:12 - when you learn you're on you'll pick up
06:14 - a lot quicker because you'll understand
06:15 - what these methods are what these
06:17 - properties are and what a class is over
