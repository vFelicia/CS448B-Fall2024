00:00 - okay so today we're going to talk about
00:02 - exponents and we've already talked about
00:06 - them a little bit when we talked about
00:09 - order of operations but today we're
00:11 - going to learn how to write
00:14 - multiplication as exponents and we're
00:17 - going to learn some basic exponent rules
00:19 - it's going to help you solve some
00:23 - equations so you remember an exponent is
00:28 - written like x squared or Y cubed so
00:32 - this number right here tells us how many
00:35 - times X is going to multiply by itself
00:40 - so 4x squared when you if you remember
00:43 - talking about squares in geometry it's x
00:46 - times X or Y cubed is y times y times y
00:53 - so we're going to write this expression
00:55 - as an exponent there's only 14 so we can
00:59 - write it for to the one which you know
01:03 - if it's just to the 1 power you don't
01:05 - have to write it because it's assumed
01:07 - that anything that doesn't have an
01:09 - exponent is just to the 1 power so we
01:12 - have 1 2 3 4 4 X's multiplied so we have
01:21 - X to the fourth and we have 1 2 3 y's so
01:26 - we have Y to the third so if it's
01:29 - written like this and then asked for the
01:31 - cube of c- a well here's some things
01:37 - you'll have to just kind of memorize
01:40 - cube means to the third power square
01:44 - which you already know means to the
01:47 - second power and then anything after
01:51 - three you're just going to say to the
01:53 - fourth power to the fifth power or
01:55 - they're just going to write it out like
01:57 - this and have you write it so the cube
02:00 - of C minus a is C minus a remember
02:05 - because this is we want this first
02:06 - remember our order of operations and
02:09 - then we just put a cube on the outside
02:12 - of the parentheses
02:13 - so now we're going to talk about are
02:16 - some basic exponent rules so the only
02:22 - way you can combine exponents are if
02:25 - they have the same base and the base is
02:29 - this number right here or if it's a
02:33 - letter it has to be the same letter or
02:35 - if it's like 4 squared times 4 squared
02:40 - you can combine those so now when we
02:44 - have something with an exponent times
02:48 - the same base with an exponent we're
02:50 - going to add our powers so for this we
02:53 - take two plus two is four and this
02:57 - becomes a to the fourth because if you
03:00 - look this is a times a and then this is
03:03 - times a times a so we have 4 a's so a to
03:06 - the fourth when we're adding exponents
03:09 - with the same base this becomes 2 a
03:15 - squared because this is a times a plus a
03:20 - times a so this is a squared this is a
03:25 - squared since we have two of them we can
03:27 - combine them like that you cannot and I
03:30 - repeat cannot combine exponents over
03:37 - addition by multiplying them and for
03:42 - this last one we have a number with an
03:45 - exponent raised to another exponent so
03:48 - what you're going to do is you're going
03:50 - to multiply your powers so this becomes
03:54 - a to the sixth this is the only time you
03:58 - actually multiply your powers because up
04:00 - here it looks like you multiply them but
04:03 - you added them you add up here and when
04:05 - it's a power to another power you
04:08 - multiply so here is this little note you
04:12 - have to remember you cannot distribute
04:15 - an exponent so this
04:19 - and we're not going to talk that much
04:23 - into it because this deals with um some
04:26 - more advanced concepts I just want you
04:28 - to know that you cannot say that this is
04:30 - equal to this because this is not true
04:35 - and we'll figure out why a little bit
04:39 - later on but you just if they give you
04:42 - an expression like this and they don't
04:45 - give you numbers to plug in there's
04:46 - nothing you can do this is the only way
04:48 - you can write it so now we're going to
04:51 - do some work with exponents so when it
04:54 - says evaluate it means plug in these
04:57 - numbers and find out what it equals so
05:00 - we're going to plug in 2 for X so we
05:03 - have 2 squared times 3 cubed times 4 so
05:09 - 2 times two is four so sig 1 for 3 times
05:15 - 3 is 9 times 3 is 27 times 4 i'm going
05:20 - to put that in the calculator because
05:22 - that's going to be a kind of big number
05:24 - 4 x 4 x 27 432 exponents get really big
05:36 - really fast so this time each one we're
05:40 - going to go on to number three 2q
05:43 - squared three squared 4 squared so 2
05:48 - squared is 4 times 3 squared which is
05:51 - nine times 4 squared which is 16 and
05:54 - again I'm going to pull out my
05:56 - calculator 576 when doing problems with
06:06 - exponents it's really beneficial to use
06:08 - a calculator just because the numbers
06:10 - get so big I mean you can do them by
06:12 - hand it's just easier so 4 cubed times 3
06:18 - 4 times 4 is 16 times 4 is 64 64 x 3 is
06:24 - equal
06:27 - to 192 and then we have three squared
06:34 - times two now this one isn't going to be
06:36 - that big three squared is 9 times 2 is
06:40 - 18 so that's all the work we're going to
06:43 - do with exponents today but make sure
06:47 - you come back and we're going to learn
06:48 - about polynomial expressions
