00:00 - so we want to go ahead and create
00:01 - another variable here called scroll
00:04 - underscore height and that's going to
00:06 - equal text area underscore height and we
00:12 - want to minus the inner height of this
00:14 - terms text area so we go ahead and
00:17 - select no be just be this and then dot
00:22 - in a height like that so let's just go
00:27 - ahead and pop the scroll height into
00:31 - here and just call height and let's go
00:35 - ahead and refresh and scroll down and
00:38 - you can see this is 560 so the original
00:42 - the value that we had minus 560 is going
00:45 - to equal the the actual height so sorry
00:50 - no I'm completely wrong I could have
00:52 - gone and said in a high and echoed out
00:54 - in a high or put the text inside of here
00:58 - so we can go ahead and do that now and
01:01 - that will show you the inner height
01:02 - which is 164 and now what we've done is
01:06 - we've subtracted 164 from this original
01:09 - text area a text area high and then we
01:12 - have the scroll height which will match
01:16 - the inside height of the document of
01:19 - inside height of the text area sorry so
01:22 - now that we have this accurate value we
01:24 - can go ahead and perform an if statement
01:27 - but we first of all need to return the
01:30 - value let's just return let's just get
01:32 - rid up back we need to return the value
01:35 - of where the scroll is at so we can do
01:38 - this and we can match it to the scroll
01:40 - height that we retrieved earlier so the
01:42 - scroll height that we retrieved earlier
01:44 - is 560 so if we were to return the
01:47 - scroll height which is as we scroll down
01:49 - the the point there which where our this
01:52 - should match v 560 when we get to the
01:55 - end it's important that when we get to
01:57 - the end we can match it because that's
01:59 - why we want to show the check box so
02:04 - scroll top is going to equal
02:07 - this dot scroll top and this is a jQuery
02:13 - function and that's going to return the
02:16 - current position of the scrollbar so we
02:19 - can go ahead and say scroll top and
02:21 - we're going to put that into our
02:23 - feedback div so now when we scroll down
02:26 - you can see this value incrementing when
02:28 - we get to the end I equals 560 so we did
02:31 - some calculations earlier and got the
02:32 - actual height of the inside as we
02:35 - scrolled so the whole scroll area and
02:38 - now we've returned the same value so we
02:41 - can match this at the end yeah we can
02:43 - match this at the end so let's go ahead
02:46 - and just get rid of this we no longer
02:49 - now need this div just go and get rid of
02:52 - that as well and now what we want to do
02:55 - is perform an if statement to check
02:56 - whether the scroll top is equal to the
03:00 - scroll height the acura height value
03:02 - that we returned for the inside so we
03:05 - just simply say if a scroll underscore
03:08 - top is equal to scroll underscore height
03:11 - we want to disable this disabled
03:15 - attribute so we want to remove the
03:17 - attribute completely so all we do is we
03:20 - say hash agree which remember is our
03:22 - check box area or our check box element
03:25 - and we just want to remove an attribute
03:28 - from that and that attribute is disabled
03:32 - so now we've relayed each value into
03:35 - that div and displayed that they match
03:37 - as we get to the bottom so now as the
03:40 - scroll top equals the scroll height we
03:43 - know that we've we've scrolled down
03:46 - essentially to the bottom of this text
03:48 - area so now when we refresh and we
03:50 - scroll down you can see this is still
03:52 - disabled but when we reach the bottom
03:54 - the condition of this if statement will
03:56 - be true and therefore this check box
03:59 - will be enabled so this is quite a
04:01 - simple piece of code let's go ahead and
04:06 - make the height a bit bigger just to see
04:08 - how this doesn't affect the
04:09 - functionality so I made the height
04:12 - slightly bigger but however when we
04:14 - scroll down we still match it and it
04:16 - still is available to check so the code
04:19 - that we've written dynamic
04:20 - the updates using pretty much these two
04:23 - variables dual the calculation so
04:26 - whatever height we have the scroll area
04:28 - at or the text area ah it will always
04:31 - return this condition is true because
04:35 - we're returning the the most accurate
04:37 - values so this will work obviously
04:39 - whatever height or whatever width you
04:42 - have the text area at so quite a useful
04:45 - tool if you wanted to include something
04:47 - like this in terms and conditions
04:49 - obviously you can enable and disable
04:51 - buttons instead of check out and check
04:54 - box areas if you wanted this literally
04:57 - just to be a button you could go ahead
04:59 - and just replace this here with a button
05:03 - and then you have a value for your
05:06 - button so for example continue we'll
05:11 - just get rid of that for now and it
05:13 - would work in exactly the same way you
05:15 - can see that the continue button is
05:17 - disabled yet when we go all the way down
05:19 - to the bottom this button is enabled so
05:21 - quite versatile with different elements
05:24 - as well obviously the disabled attribute
05:26 - applies to almost all HTML elements so
05:30 - quite an easy way to do this the
05:33 - calculations are slightly complicated
05:35 - but the overall concept is obviously
05:38 - quite easy and you could go ahead and
05:40 - apply this to a text area and obviously
05:44 - use this in an actual real life
05:47 - situation which is nice because it's
05:49 - nice to see something that can actually
05:50 - be used so that's how we use scroll top
05:54 - and the scroll height and the inner
05:56 - height to calculate this and display a
05:59 - hidden or disabled element
