00:00 - what's going on guys it's Bucky and
00:02 - welcome to your sixth C++ tutorial and
00:04 - in this tutorial I want to go over some
00:06 - concepts with variables that are
00:08 - definitely going to help you it later on
00:10 - so the first thing I want to go over is
00:11 - this you remember in the last tutorial
00:13 - where I told you guys that there
00:15 - basically two different ways to create
00:17 - variables the first way is to create a
00:19 - variable called tuna or something and
00:21 - set it equal to a value like 43 all on
00:23 - one line simple enough easy to
00:26 - understand well what I also told you
00:28 - guys you can do is you can declare AKA
00:31 - create it on one line and set it equal
00:33 - to a value on another line such as that
00:36 - they're both perfectly acceptable ways
00:38 - to do things the one thing I wanted to
00:41 - stress is that whenever you do this way
00:44 - declare it on one line instead of equal
00:46 - to value on another line you don't need
00:48 - to write what type of variable it is
00:50 - again once you give C++ the information
00:54 - of what type of data you're working with
00:56 - you don't need to list it every time
00:57 - you're working with a variable C++ will
01:00 - remember that information and you know
01:03 - it'll keep it so whenever you're working
01:05 - with tuna later on you don't need to
01:07 - explicitly write int and actually you
01:09 - can't or else it'll give you error
01:10 - message so just make sure that you know
01:13 - just remember that don't write int twice
01:15 - on the same variable so aside from that
01:19 - let me show you guys this in tuna equals
01:22 - 99 so later on and I didn't tell you
01:26 - guys this but what you can do is if you
01:28 - set tuna equal to something else notes
01:30 - like
01:31 - 76 whenever your computer creates a
01:34 - variable it sets aside a piece of memory
01:37 - to store that value in this case 99 well
01:40 - whenever you create or excuse me
01:42 - whenever you use that variable again and
01:44 - set it equal to a new value what your
01:46 - computer is going to do is it's going to
01:48 - wipe out the old value in order to make
01:50 - room for the new value so now you said
01:53 - all right we have a variable called tuna
01:55 - and that's equal to 99 well now we have
01:58 - a variable called tuna and we want to
02:01 - set this equal to 76 well all right so
02:05 - we're going to try to print out tuna and
02:07 - our computer is going to say all right
02:08 - should I print out 99 or 76 well since
02:11 - we created one originally that was 99
02:14 - and then we over wrote it to make it 76
02:18 - it's going to print out 76 so let's go
02:20 - ahead and build and run this and see
02:21 - what we get 76 so basically whenever you
02:25 - have a value it's placed in a memory
02:28 - location and then whenever you give that
02:31 - variable a new value it's going to
02:33 - overrate the old value and put it in the
02:35 - same location so I just want to tell you
02:37 - guys that this is how you can overwrite
02:40 - variables so if you're expecting 99 and
02:43 - you got 76 this is why so that's
02:46 - actually all I have for you guys for
02:47 - this tutorial again the two things I
02:49 - want to stress is whenever you're
02:51 - creating a variable you only write the
02:54 - type once you don't need to write it
02:56 - every single time and then whenever you
02:58 - need to reassign a value you just go
03:00 - ahead and write the variable name and
03:02 - not the type again and also whenever
03:05 - you're overwriting a
03:06 - variable you use the variable and it's
03:09 - going to be equal to the latest value so
03:11 - whenever you you know set this equal to
03:13 - 76 it's going to wipe out the 99 and use
03:16 - the 76 so I just wanted to stress those
03:19 - you know a couple memory Concepts So
03:21 - then whenever we're building programs
03:22 - later on you might have a better
03:24 - understanding of how it works so for now
03:26 - that's all I have for you guys in the
03:28 - next tutorial you know how I said that
03:30 - we're going to be going over arithmetic
03:32 - like how to add two numbers together
03:34 - well there's actually a bunch of
03:36 - different arithmetic operators that we
03:38 - need to learn and that's what we're
03:39 - going to be covering in the next
03:40 - tutorial but for now thank you guys for
03:42 - watching don't forget to subscribe and
03:43 - I'll see you the next video
