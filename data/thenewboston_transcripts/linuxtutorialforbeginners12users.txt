00:00 - all righty hoses welcome back and in
00:02 - this video we're going to learn about
00:05 - users so users are actually really
00:08 - simple so just like Windows or Mac your
00:11 - computer can have different users now a
00:13 - user of course is just anyone who uses
00:16 - the computer so if I was setting up this
00:18 - computer for my family I might have a
00:20 - user account for Me Maybe one for my
00:23 - brother maybe one for my mom my sister
00:26 - whatever so basically anyone that uses
00:28 - the computer is a user
00:30 - simple enough now the reason that we
00:32 - want to create different accounts is
00:34 - because these users usually have
00:36 - restrictions on which files they can
00:39 - access so if I had a company I could
00:42 - have a group of users that were uh like
00:44 - my front end guys so they could only
00:46 - access the HTML files the web design and
00:50 - for my back end guys those users could
00:53 - access you know the PHP files the
00:55 - database so it's a nice way to you know
00:58 - restrict access for each group of people
01:02 - now whenever you use Linux there's a
01:05 - couple things you need to understand
01:07 - first is that there is always a super
01:09 - user who is named root now the super
01:13 - user can do anything
01:16 - so whenever you like if you're the owner
01:19 - of the entire server you always have
01:20 - root or super user access now you may be
01:24 - thinking all right so I just bought my
01:26 - own server I'm the only one on it I'm
01:28 - setting up my own site I'm just going to
01:30 - use root this main account all the time
01:33 - and that way I'll be able to do anything
01:35 - sounds great right but even if you want
01:39 - full control over your server and you're
01:41 - the only one accessing it you usually
01:43 - don't want to log in as root and that's
01:47 - because even though they can do anything
01:50 - that's not usually a good thing because
01:52 - there are a lot of system files that you
01:54 - don't want to accidentally delete or
01:56 - accidentally edit so like I said even if
01:58 - you're the core
02:00 - uh single system administrator on a
02:02 - server you usually create another
02:04 - account that um you know can't
02:07 - accidentally mess up any system files
02:09 - and then if you ever want to you know
02:11 - actually run a system command with full
02:13 - super user privileges then you just use
02:16 - pseudo or sudu like we saw in the last
02:18 - video and you can do that so that's what
02:21 - people usually do so let me show you the
02:24 - basics of how to add a new user how to
02:27 - manage the groups and whatnot so right
02:30 - now let me just make sure I'm in my home
02:31 - directory and let me just uh I don't
02:34 - know navigate to the desktop I'll show
02:35 - you guys a few
02:37 - things so let me visually do this so you
02:40 - guys can see what's going on so let's
02:42 - make a new document and I'll just name
02:44 - this like a
02:47 - corn and I'll just write I am corn
02:51 - whatever just something stupid in
02:54 - there all right so we got one file just
02:57 - for demonstrating and if I ever do this
02:59 - this LS minus LA and look at that file
03:03 - check it out we already know what a lot
03:05 - of stuff is the date it's created um the
03:08 - name of it whatever and then we see
03:10 - these two things bucky bucky hm all
03:14 - right well we know I'm logged in as
03:16 - Bucky but why would it say it twice well
03:19 - whenever you're looking at a file like
03:21 - this again this first thing are the
03:24 - permissions already learned about those
03:26 - this name and this name stands for the
03:30 - owner and the group they belong to so of
03:34 - course I am Bucky so I own this file or
03:36 - is this one right here and also I belong
03:39 - to the group Bucky so you can have
03:42 - different groups and I'm going to show
03:43 - you guys how to do that in a second but
03:45 - remember this whenever you create a new
03:48 - user for the first time it also
03:51 - automatically creates a group for them
03:53 - with the same name so if I want to make
03:56 - a group called boys and you know put me
03:59 - in my brother in that in a group called
04:01 - girls and put my sister and my mom in
04:03 - there I could do that but anyways just
04:05 - remember cuz a lot of people don't
04:07 - understand why they see the name twice
04:08 - that's what's going on the owner or the
04:11 - individual user and then the group so
04:14 - let me clear out of this and let's just
04:16 - go ahead and add a new user so I'm going
04:19 - to add uh my mom is a user on this
04:21 - computer and in order to add a a new
04:24 - user you need root or super user
04:27 - privileges so since I'm logged in as
04:30 - Bucky I need to call PSE sudo so super
04:33 - user do this and the command for just
04:36 - adding a new user is user ad and then
04:40 - their username and her username can just
04:43 - be mom so now I have to say okay make
04:47 - sure that you have the right privileges
04:49 - so I'm just going to type the password
04:50 - and this is just the main password I use
04:52 - the login and we now added mom mom is a
04:56 - user so what I want to do for mom right
04:59 - now is I want to make sure she has the
05:01 - right password so
05:04 - pseudo p a SS
05:07 - swd mom so I'm going to edit the
05:09 - password for Mom and I'll just
05:14 - write give her a password and then when
05:17 - she comes home from work I can say hey
05:19 - Mom I made an account this is your
05:21 - password boom you're good to go she's
05:23 - going to go what the heck you talking
05:24 - about I have no idea what Linux is come
05:27 - eat your dinner but whatever that's my
05:30 - story all right so that's the basics of
05:33 - how users work and I'll actually wait
05:35 - till the next tutorial to uh show you
05:36 - guys about groups because there's a
05:38 - couple things I want to talk about so
05:40 - there you go see you guys next time
