00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the New Boston
00:06 - in this tutorial we're going to look at
00:07 - implementing jQuery into a page and just
00:10 - testing if it actually works or not so
00:13 - one of the things that we need to do uh
00:15 - first of all is go over to the
00:17 - jquery.com
00:19 - homepage and you'll see here that we can
00:22 - actually download
00:23 - jQuery now there's a production and a
00:26 - development version and you're going to
00:27 - need to choose the production version
00:30 - the development version you'll notice is
00:32 - slightly larger it's 229 KB and this is
00:35 - uncompressed code now the reason for
00:38 - this development version is if you are
00:39 - developing plugins I need access to the
00:43 - um uncompressed code for
00:46 - jQuery however the production version is
00:49 - only 31 kiloby and is minified and
00:52 - gzipped now let's take a look at the
00:54 - difference between them quickly you'll
00:56 - see that the uncompressed code just
00:58 - looks like normal Javas script um a
01:01 - large large file um as uh as you would
01:05 - expect from a 229 KV file let's go and
01:08 - look at the production version you can
01:10 - see that it's still long but it has been
01:13 - compressed uh to create a shorter file
01:16 - size so once you have the production
01:19 - version selected go ahead and download J
01:21 - jQuery it should open up in your browser
01:24 - as code what you're going to want to do
01:26 - is select the entire page and copy it to
01:29 - your CL
01:30 - clipboard
01:32 - copy now we want to come over to your
01:34 - text editor and before we paste it into
01:37 - a file we'll just have a look at our
01:39 - directory structure before we
01:41 - continue now when I write uh any
01:44 - JavaScript code I keep it in a file
01:47 - called JS index.php is the file that
01:50 - we've got currently open here and JS is
01:54 - where I would keep all of my JavaScript
01:57 - um files so let's just look in
02:00 - JavaScript you can see that I've created
02:03 - a file called jquery.js I've given it a
02:06 - JS extension and that's the file we've
02:08 - also got open in our text editor so
02:12 - essentially what I'm going to do is I'm
02:13 - going to copy and paste the code from
02:16 - jQuery and I'm going to paste it into
02:18 - this jquery.js file let's go back again
02:22 - now inside index.php and I'm going to
02:24 - include this jQuery file that is found
02:27 - in the JS folder so that's essentially
02:30 - the directory structure we're going to
02:31 - be keeping and where we place jQuery in
02:35 - order to include it into our page so
02:38 - like I said I've got this jquery.js file
02:40 - open in the JS folder and I'm just going
02:43 - to paste the code that I retrieved from
02:45 - the jquery.com
02:47 - website now I'm going well I've saved it
02:50 - out and I need to come over to index.php
02:53 - in order to include it into my page so
02:56 - how do we include it well usually when
02:59 - you're writing code code uh JavaScript
03:01 - code you would start in your head and
03:03 - you would do something like script type
03:06 - is equal to
03:09 - text/javascript so we've got the type
03:11 - attribute in the script tag and then we
03:14 - would come down and we would end our
03:15 - script and we would write our JavaScript
03:18 - code in here now because jQuery is uh a
03:22 - 31kb file and uh we need the body of the
03:26 - document to load before we actually um
03:29 - use things like event uh event handling
03:33 - you'll notice in the last example I
03:35 - showed you with the hide and show button
03:37 - um we actually need to allow every
03:40 - element in our page to be able to load
03:43 - before we actually start to check for
03:45 - elements so we're not going to be
03:47 - writing any code or including any files
03:50 - in the head part of our document we're
03:52 - going to be doing it at the very end of
03:55 - our body so let's go ahead and type
03:58 - script type equal equals
04:02 - text/javascript and let's go ahead and
04:04 - end that script there now usually you
04:07 - would write your code in here however
04:09 - what we're doing is we're including this
04:11 - um just because uh we don't want to
04:14 - paste our code into our document so it
04:16 - would work if you were to paste the
04:19 - jQuery um file into this document let's
04:23 - just wait for that to
04:26 - load okay so I've just managed to get
04:28 - rid of that because the uh file size of
04:31 - that crashed my browser so the example
04:33 - didn't really work however um my point
04:36 - is that we could write our JavaScript
04:38 - code inside of here however what we're
04:41 - doing is we're just simply starting this
04:43 - script tag and ending it but we're
04:45 - supplying the source attribute so we can
04:48 - say
04:48 - JS jquery.js now because we've pasted
04:53 - our jQuery code in here this is now
04:55 - available to use in this document we can
04:58 - write all of our code up here and uh
05:01 - we'll still have um use of the jQuery
05:04 - Library so now what we want to
05:07 - do now that we've included jqu inel page
05:11 - is actually testing whether it works so
05:14 - in the next video we're going to be
05:15 - short creating some short inline um
05:19 - jQuery which is highly discouraged just
05:22 - so we can test the functionality of
05:25 - jQuery and see if it's worked by
05:27 - including it uh by this method
05:30 - you'll often find that if you were to
05:31 - include jQuery and you did it you didn't
05:34 - do it properly you'll have no control uh
05:37 - or use of jQuery at all so extremely
05:40 - it's extremely important if we just
05:42 - create a simple inline test um just to
05:46 - see if it's worked now if you're not
05:48 - sure of the uh difference or the
05:51 - similarities or you know the rights or
05:55 - wrongs of inline or external uh
05:58 - JavaScript then uh this will be
06:00 - explained in another video um you'll be
06:04 - able to understand why it's not so good
06:06 - to use inline uh JavaScript or
06:09 - jQuery
06:12 - now if you remember the example we
06:15 - looked at a couple of videos back you'll
06:17 - notice that I was using um external
06:20 - Javascript and there was no actual
06:22 - JavaScript present within my button or
06:24 - the paragraph that I that I was actually
06:27 - hiding and showing so we'll look at that
06:29 - another video however in the next video
06:31 - we'll look at a quick example to see if
06:33 - jQuery is working on our page
