00:00 - so today our focus is on parallel and
00:05 - perpendicular lines soap airlines do not
00:09 - intersect so if you look these two lines
00:13 - have an equal distance between them and
00:18 - they will never intersect and we denote
00:22 - parallel lines with these little arrows
00:25 - so those two lines are parallel and
00:35 - these two lines are parallel so
00:40 - perpendicular lines intersect to form
00:44 - right angles and we denote this by a
00:47 - little square just like we denote any
00:51 - any kind of right angle so each one of
00:55 - these angles right here is the right
01:02 - angle so they all measure 90 degrees so
01:08 - now that we know what parallel and
01:12 - perpendicular lines are we're gonna name
01:16 - a few so name two sets of parallel lines
01:22 - well if we start with segments Ln we
01:28 - know that Ln is parallel to mo because
01:32 - they both have these little lines on
01:35 - them so Ln is parallel to mo and that's
01:42 - how we write parallel lines with these
01:44 - two little lines right right here so the
01:48 - second set if I look for to tick marks
01:51 - there is LM and n oh and that makes
01:56 - sense because if I were to extend these
01:58 - lines on
02:00 - forever and ever and ever they would
02:03 - never intersect so line LMK is parallel
02:10 - to n.o
02:18 - name two sets of perpendicular lines so
02:22 - like we said perpendicular lines
02:24 - intersect to form right angles so we
02:29 - know that none of the parallel lines can
02:33 - also be perpendicular so if we look
02:36 - we've got a right angle right here and
02:40 - Ln this segment right here and n 0 meet
02:51 - intersect to form a right angle so that
02:54 - means Ln is parallel excuse me is
03:00 - perpendicular to n 0 and if you look at
03:06 - this other right angle right here it's
03:08 - formed when LM and Mo intersect so that
03:14 - means segment LM is parallel to line
03:19 - segment em oh well that's all we're
03:23 - gonna do today with parallel and
03:26 - perpendicular lines but next time we're
03:30 - going to talk about other kinds of
03:32 - angles that can be formed when two lines
03:36 - intersect to make sure you come check it
03:38 - out
