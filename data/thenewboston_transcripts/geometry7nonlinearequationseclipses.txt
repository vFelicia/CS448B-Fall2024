00:00 - so today we're going to talk about our
00:02 - third kind of nonlinear graph which is
00:06 - called an ellipse so this is the
00:09 - standard form of ellipse an ellipse X
00:12 - minus K squared over a squared plus y
00:16 - minus H over B squared equals 1 so we're
00:21 - KH is your Center so for this equation
00:26 - we have x squared over a squared plus y
00:30 - squared over B squared equals 1 so for
00:35 - this particular ellipse we have a center
00:40 - at 0-0 its major axis is going to lie
00:46 - along the x axis because we know that 2
00:48 - is greater than B if B was greater than
00:52 - to these I mean then two then a then
00:57 - these two would be switched and its
01:02 - major axis has a length of 2a and it's
01:06 - minor axis has a length of to be that
01:09 - probably won't make much sense now but
01:11 - we're going to do an example so we have
01:14 - x squared plus y squared x squared over
01:18 - 9 plus y squared over 4 equals 1 so a is
01:22 - equal to you have to remember that this
01:25 - is a squared and this is B squared so I
01:28 - is equal to the square root of 3 b is
01:33 - equal to 2 ok so for this one since a is
01:40 - greater than B because nine is in fact
01:44 - greater than for its major axis is going
01:50 - to fall along the x-axis and its length
01:54 - is going to be to a so the length of
01:56 - this is going to be 6 so since the
02:00 - center is at 0 0 I'm gonna just do that
02:03 - and label that center so it's major axis
02:06 - so
02:07 - it's gonna go six in this direction and
02:13 - six in this direction or no excuse me
02:19 - it's going to go three in this direction
02:21 - and three in this direction okay so it's
02:27 - going to go one two three one two three
02:31 - it's minor axis is going to be the y
02:37 - axis because b is less than a and it's
02:41 - going to be the length of to be it's
02:43 - going to be the length of two times two
02:45 - so it's going to go up to this way and
02:49 - down to this way and if we connect the
02:53 - points we get this oval shape because
03:01 - since a and B are not equal it's always
03:05 - going to look like an oval with one of
03:07 - the axis is being bigger than the other
03:10 - so now we're going to do X minus 3
03:13 - squared over 25 plus y minus 4 squared
03:17 - over 16 so first we're going to find out
03:20 - what a so a is equal to 5 b is equal to
03:24 - 4 since a is greater than B our major
03:29 - axis is going to be the x-axis and it's
03:33 - going to have a length of two times five
03:36 - so 10 our minor axis I'm going to put my
03:41 - I from minor axis it's going to be along
03:44 - the y axis and it's going to have a
03:46 - length of two times B which is eight so
03:50 - our Center this time instead of being at
03:53 - 0 0 it's going to be at if you remember
03:56 - this is y minus K X minus K Y minus H
04:02 - and our center is always KH so our
04:05 - center is going to be three four so 1 2
04:09 - 3 up 12
04:10 - 34 and I'm going to have to add some
04:14 - lines here because I'm going to run out
04:17 - of room ok so its major axis is going to
04:25 - go five to the right one two three four
04:30 - five to the right and five to the left
04:33 - so one two three four five it's minor
04:38 - axis is going to go two up and two down
04:42 - and our ellipse our ellipse is gonna
04:50 - look like that and I know it's a really
04:54 - bad ellipse it looks really bad that's
04:57 - because i'm not using real graph paper
04:59 - if you're at home and you're using real
05:01 - graph paper your ellipses should come
05:04 - out very egg like it should look like a
05:08 - perfect egg so that's actually all we're
05:11 - going to do with ellipses today make
05:13 - sure you come back and we're going to go
05:15 - over our last kind of nonlinear equation
05:17 - which is called a hyperbola
