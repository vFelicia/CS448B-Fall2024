00:01 - all righty then welcome back to your
00:03 - 34th tutorial and in this tutorial I'm
00:06 - going to be talking to you guys about
00:07 - spotlights some of my favorite types of
00:10 - Lights in the udk so in order to add
00:13 - spotlights to the screen we can go ahead
00:14 - and add them but let's uh spice things
00:17 - up a little bit by adding some static
00:18 - meshes so go ahead and open up your
00:21 - content browser and make sure you have
00:23 - static meshes selected and go ahead and
00:25 - select lights again you don't have to do
00:28 - this but I just want to add a little
00:30 - flavor this one looks pretty cool but I
00:32 - want something a little bit different
00:34 - ooh look o one of these either one een
00:37 - money okay this one go ahead and drag
00:40 - one of these lights out on the screen
00:41 - and first of all I can tell this thing
00:44 - is massive so I'm going to go ahead and
00:46 - Shrink this a bit probably in your side
00:48 - view is going to be your best bet and go
00:51 - ahead and slide that down and I'll just
00:54 - slide that up I want to make sure that
00:56 - it's kind of in front of my uh whatever
00:58 - this thing's called a totem pole pillar
01:00 - cuz I wanted to cast a pretty cool
01:02 - shadow so I'm going to go ahead and add
01:04 - one right there and then I'm going to go
01:06 - ahead and ALT drag and add another one
01:08 - kind of close but kind of far away these
01:11 - kind of look like people with like their
01:13 - hands hanging down and their legs like
01:16 - kind of hanging kind of like tiny little
01:18 - glowing robots nailed to the wall that's
01:21 - what I think of when I see these is that
01:23 - wrong should I see the psychiatrist
01:25 - probably but anyways now that we got our
01:27 - level set up time to start adding some
01:29 - lights
01:30 - so the first thing we want to do is
01:32 - figure out how to add these spotlights
01:35 - and that's the easy part in order to add
01:37 - spotlights go up here to view browser
01:40 - windows and what we're going to want to
01:42 - select is actor classes now we go ahead
01:45 - and click this and we can already see I
01:47 - have everything because I was messing
01:48 - around with it before this if you expand
01:51 - lights these are all the different types
01:54 - of lights so you guys are saying all
01:55 - right spotlights and point lights those
01:57 - are two kinds of Lights that's it well
01:59 - look how many different types of lights
02:01 - that we have to learn pretty cool huh so
02:04 - in this tutorial I'm going to be working
02:06 - with spotlights so go ahead and select
02:08 - the regular Spotlight not Spotlight
02:10 - movable trable just go ahead and select
02:12 - a regular Spotlight and don't double
02:15 - click it or try to drag it or anything
02:16 - just go ahead and select it and xit out
02:18 - of your screen now in your perspective
02:20 - view go ahead and rightclick and WR and
02:24 - you'll have an option that says add
02:25 - Spotlight here so go ahead and click
02:27 - that and now everything goes dark
02:30 - because it added the spotlight but it's
02:31 - not shining on anything yet so go ahead
02:33 - and make sure you have your move tool
02:35 - and drag that up and as you can see a
02:39 - spotlight is
02:42 - basically well how I don't know it's a
02:44 - spotlight I don't know how to grab it
02:46 - better than that you guys should know
02:47 - what a spotlight is it's basically if
02:49 - you like have a spotlight in your hand
02:53 - and you look at what's in your hand
02:54 - that's a spotlight I mean for real I
02:57 - can't explain it better than just
02:58 - looking at it you can can see what it
03:00 - does it's different than like a light
03:01 - bulb where it kind of goes in every
03:04 - direction that it kind of Shines on a
03:05 - certain point so yeah that's kind of a
03:08 - better explanation so with that being
03:10 - said I want to go over one thing there
03:12 - are a couple properties that we have to
03:15 - watch out for or a couple common
03:17 - properties when dealing with spotlights
03:19 - so go ahead and with your Spotlight
03:21 - selected hit F4 and this is going to
03:23 - bring up your properties window but
03:25 - check it out if you go ahead and expand
03:28 - light and expand light component you're
03:30 - going to have a special section for
03:32 - spotlight component now you're going to
03:34 - have two main properties that you need
03:36 - to watch out for the first one is inner
03:38 - cone angle and the second one is outer
03:41 - cone Angle now right now you can see
03:43 - that it's kind of you know just one cone
03:46 - out on the screen so you might be kind
03:47 - of confused as what the difference
03:49 - between these two are and a lot of
03:50 - beginners are so I'm going to explain it
03:52 - to you inner cone angle is let me make
03:54 - this inner cone and outer cone different
03:56 - change these like
03:57 - 20 and 50
04:00 - so now whenever you look on your screen
04:02 - you can see that you get two distinctive
04:04 - cones you get your inner cone which is
04:06 - right here and you get your big outer
04:08 - cone that surrounds it now it may be a
04:11 - little hard to tell what's going on just
04:12 - by looking at this but it's basically
04:14 - this whenever you're setting up your
04:16 - light your inner cone is like your hot
04:18 - spot that's the brightest spot of your
04:21 - light now the outer cone is kind of like
04:24 - the point where it starts fading off so
04:27 - think of your light more of like a
04:28 - gradient where the inner cone is going
04:30 - to be the deepest brightest color and
04:33 - your outer cone is pretty much where you
04:35 - want it to fade off and again how the
04:38 - udk works it isn't going to exactly end
04:41 - at this point because it calculates you
04:43 - know light bouncing off of different
04:45 - stuff but it's going to give you a
04:46 - general idea of how your light's going
04:48 - to work so again the inner cone just
04:51 - pretend let's just call this the bright
04:53 - spot in the outer cone we'll call this
04:55 - the fall-off cone so go ahead and once
04:58 - you got that you know how set up how you
05:00 - want it I'm going to set mine at 2050 if
05:02 - you want to follow along just go ahead
05:04 - and X out of that and now what we need
05:06 - to do is I want to set up this Spotlight
05:09 - so it kind of is sits right on top of
05:12 - these little static meshes because these
05:14 - are just static meshes or 3DS model with
05:16 - glowing material if we were to play the
05:18 - game right now as you can see it doesn't
05:21 - really give off any real light at least
05:23 - not the effect that I'm going for so I'm
05:25 - going to take this Spotlight and
05:26 - position it right on top of one of these
05:28 - so in order to do that probably your
05:30 - front view is the best bet go ahead and
05:32 - rotate this somewhere around 90 degrees
05:35 - looks pretty close and now what I want
05:37 - to do is in my top view position this
05:41 - right about there and also in my front
05:44 - view slide it down a bit it might be
05:46 - even easier if I did that in my side
05:48 - view but this is good for now and
05:51 - another thing that you probably want to
05:52 - watch out for is whenever you're
05:54 - positioning these lights make sure that
05:56 - you don't put them right inside your
05:58 - static mesh because look what happens to
06:00 - my light whenever I want to do that keep
06:02 - an eye on my perspective View and I'm
06:04 - going to drag this into my static mesh
06:06 - you're going to say all right it
06:07 - probably be good if I position it right
06:09 - inside like right there well as soon as
06:11 - your light Gets behind your static mesh
06:14 - and even if it's like half and half is
06:16 - going to shut off because the static
06:17 - mesh is going to be blocking the light
06:20 - source from entering your map so make
06:22 - sure it it doesn't sit exactly inside it
06:24 - like you might think but push it out
06:26 - away from it a little bit again the
06:28 - player isn't going to notice difference
06:30 - and it's going to achieve the effect
06:31 - you're going for so basically I got my
06:33 - light shining exactly how I want to if I
06:36 - were to play this game it would look
06:38 - like the light is coming right from this
06:40 - point right here so now I'm going to
06:42 - change a couple more properties actually
06:45 - one thing I want to notice is this all
06:47 - right so I'm playing this game and I
06:49 - noticed this the static mesh in the
06:52 - material that's on here is kind of like
06:54 - a dark blue material and this light
06:56 - that's coming off is kind of like a
06:58 - plain white light so I probably want to
07:00 - change that to make sure this light
07:02 - that's coming off is kind of blue so go
07:04 - ahead select your light hit F4 to change
07:06 - the light properties and we're done with
07:08 - the spotlight component so we can go
07:10 - ahead and minimize that and in your
07:13 - point light component or excuse me your
07:15 - light component I was still on my last
07:18 - tutorial there go ahead and select the
07:19 - light color now what we could do is we
07:22 - could go ahead and scroll up here to
07:24 - Blue and try to get the exact blue that
07:27 - we're looking for like that might be
07:29 - pretty close right there or a better way
07:31 - whenever you're working with lights and
07:33 - static meshes it's probably best to do
07:35 - this go ahead and select this ey dropper
07:38 - and now you can hold this anywhere
07:40 - around on your screen and check it out
07:42 - if we hold it over this green right here
07:44 - our light's going to turn green if we
07:46 - hold it over this uh blue right here
07:48 - it's going to turn blue red right here
07:50 - red but we want to select this blue
07:53 - right here so go ahead and select
07:55 - somewhere in your light right here and
07:57 - by the way look at what's going on with
07:59 - my screen right now the color is
08:02 - changing and that's because usually we
08:04 - won't get this but that's because if we
08:07 - go ahead and X out here and took a look
08:09 - at my static mesh we notice that it's
08:12 - actually the material is pulsating up
08:15 - and down the way they have the material
08:17 - set up is that it emits a different
08:19 - color and we're going to be learning how
08:21 - to do that in the upcoming tutorials but
08:23 - usually your lights aren't going to
08:25 - pulsate you can just go ahead and select
08:27 - your color so that's why my light is
08:29 - changing but usually you just hold the
08:31 - eye dropper over a piece of your map and
08:33 - it's going to be one color so go ahead
08:35 - and hit F4 oh it already opened it up
08:38 - for me and select the light color select
08:40 - your eye dropper and you hold it over
08:43 - whatever piece of your map you want to
08:45 - achieve and say I want to achieve this
08:47 - right here this cool blue color I would
08:48 - hold over that but since I'm coming from
08:51 - this light I'm just going to go ahead
08:52 - and select that right there and it's
08:54 - going to give me a nice light blue the
08:56 - same exact color as this light right
08:58 - here so now I can go ahead and X out of
09:01 - that actually what I need to do is press
09:06 - apply right there hit okay and now I get
09:10 - my light the same color as this light
09:12 - right here so if we were to go ahead and
09:14 - play this level the light that's coming
09:17 - out of the spotlight would be the exact
09:18 - same color as this as the static mesh
09:21 - and that's the exact look that we're
09:23 - looking for so what we want to do before
09:25 - we exit out of this tutorial is this
09:27 - light is set up and all we need to do is
09:29 - alt drag this over to the other
09:33 - light and now both our lights are set up
09:35 - so we can go ahead and build this
09:37 - level and I'm going to go ahead and play
09:40 - it and show you guys a real quick
09:41 - example of using spotlights in
09:43 - combination with static meshes how they
09:45 - look when your level is finally put
09:47 - together so go ahead and close out of
09:49 - this and I'm just going to go ahead and
09:51 - hit play from here and check it out it
09:53 - looks like light is coming right from
09:55 - that and again if you wanted to make it
09:58 - more you know customize it a little more
10:00 - you might want to change the settings on
10:02 - the outer and inner cone make the hot
10:04 - spot actually I probably would want it
10:06 - more how would I say this more focused
10:10 - instead of more wide this is more like
10:12 - point lightish right now but you can
10:13 - mess around with it if you want I just
10:15 - wanted to give you guys a real basic
10:17 - rough draft of how to work with
10:19 - spotlights so in the next couple
10:21 - tutorials what I'm going to be teaching
10:23 - you guys is about all those different
10:24 - kind of lights and all those different
10:26 - kinds of light properties and how to
10:28 - achieve some pretty sweet effects but
10:30 - for now as always that's all you guys
10:32 - get so thank you guys for watching I'm
10:34 - going to be uh shooting this light if
10:36 - you need me and I'll see you guys in the
10:37 - next
10:39 - tutorial
