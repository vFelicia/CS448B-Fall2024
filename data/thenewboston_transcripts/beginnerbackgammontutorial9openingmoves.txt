00:00 - what's up guys it's funky and welcome to
00:02 - another backhand with sorrow now in this
00:04 - tutorial I want to talk to you guys
00:06 - about opening moves now there are a lot
00:08 - of different opening moves that you can
00:10 - do whenever you win the role first and
00:12 - again another thing I want to point out
00:14 - I'm going to cover all the opening moves
00:16 - but if you can tell I'm not discussing
00:19 - doubles because that's impossible if you
00:21 - roll a number and they roll a number in
00:23 - they're the same then you roll again so
00:25 - that's why I'm not going to be
00:26 - discussing 3 3 or 5 5 or anything like
00:29 - that because you can't have doubles on
00:31 - your opening roll so let's go ahead and
00:33 - get started with the best opening roll
00:35 - hands down and that's a 1 3
00:37 - whenever you're old 1 3 you always want
00:39 - to play 6 2 5 and 8 5 this gives you
00:44 - your new 5 point which is such a crucial
00:46 - point in the game and also starts you
00:49 - off for a nice four point prime later on
00:51 - now with your 2 4 what I always like to
00:54 - do is like I said before build your four
00:56 - point using a 2 right here in your 4
00:59 - right there and again this is a nice
01:01 - start as well now whenever you roll a
01:03 - 3/5 like I said any time you roll and
01:06 - the dice are separated by 2 you can go
01:08 - ahead and make a new point so whenever
01:10 - your roll 1 2 3 and your 5 you can go
01:14 - ahead and make a new point on your 3
01:16 - point right there not a bad play now
01:19 - whenever you roll a 6-1 here's what I
01:21 - like to do I like to go ahead and move
01:23 - my 1 from 8 to 7 and I like to play my 6
01:26 - 13 to 7 right there now this is the only
01:30 - opening roll you can get where you can
01:32 - make an immediate 3 point prime so you
01:35 - can clearly see why this is such a
01:36 - powerful move this early on in the game
01:38 - now whenever you roll a 6 5 here's how I
01:42 - like to play that now what I like to do
01:44 - is called running my checker now since
01:47 - these checkers have the longest way to
01:49 - go you usually want to start those out
01:51 - early so they don't get trapped in so in
01:53 - my 6 5 what I like to do is take this
01:56 - checker and move all the way on my 13
01:58 - point right here not only protects it
02:00 - but again we want to get these checkers
02:02 - out early before they have a chance to
02:04 - book Prime now whenever I roll a 2 1
02:06 - here's
02:07 - like to do I like to go ahead and move
02:09 - my 13 my 11 with my 2 and also my 6 to
02:12 - my 5 in my 1 what this does is a couple
02:14 - things first of all it gives this one
02:16 - protection because they're going to be
02:17 - hard to hit from their 24 point and also
02:20 - whenever I move the 6th of the 5 it sets
02:23 - up your 5 point for an extra roll since
02:25 - look how many options you have of
02:27 - hitting your 5 point on the next row and
02:28 - owning this point such a powerful
02:31 - movement and again one of the most
02:32 - important points in the game to own
02:34 - early on is your 5 point now whenever I
02:36 - roll a 4-1 I play it a lot like the last
02:38 - time I roll 6 to 5 and you're 13 and 9
02:43 - for all the same reasons I discussed
02:45 - last time now whenever I roll a 1 5 here
02:47 - say I like to put this I like to go
02:49 - ahead and move my 6 to 5 start building
02:52 - my 5 point and I also like to move 13 8
02:55 - now typically whenever you see a 5 on
02:58 - your opening a roll this isn't the
03:00 - greatest thing you want to see since
03:01 - there's not a lot of useful stuff you
03:03 - can do with a 5 but anyways we're not
03:06 - really building anything new here but
03:08 - hey we'll take what they give us now on
03:10 - number I roll it to 6 I would play my to
03:12 - 13 and 11 and I like to play my 6 24 to
03:16 - 18 and here's what I like to do this
03:18 - first of all we can either a start
03:21 - advancing this checker out or be set up
03:23 - building a pointer right here never see
03:25 - an RA this is crazy because this is a
03:27 - very vulnerable to be hit well first of
03:30 - all if they hit us this early in the
03:31 - game
03:31 - check this out they leave this checker
03:34 - right here open being hint which one
03:36 - ever rolls 6 with this I'm going to go
03:38 - ahead and hit this and also you don't
03:40 - really have to worry too much about
03:42 - being hit early on in the game I mean
03:44 - this checker was already right here to
03:45 - begin with and first of all early on in
03:48 - the game your board is way open it's
03:51 - going to be really easy to re-enter they
03:53 - don't have any Prime's built right here
03:55 - or anything so you can take more chances
03:58 - early on in the game when your boards
04:00 - open rather than later on when they have
04:02 - a nice prime set up and it's going to be
04:04 - hard to re-enter now I go ahead and play
04:06 - three six almost identical took two six
04:09 - I go ahead and play my 13 to 10 and also
04:12 - my 24 to 18 for all the same reasons as
04:15 - last time now when you have a 4 6 this
04:18 - is going to give you the most options
04:20 - and all of these options are good the
04:22 - first thing you can do is play your 13
04:25 - 924 18 not a bad play or what you can do
04:30 - is you can use your four six vote a new
04:31 - two point which you either play or four
04:34 - right there and your six right there
04:36 - this isn't the most useful point but it
04:38 - definitely helps voting a prime later on
04:40 - in the game or what you can do
04:43 - whenever you roll a two four you can go
04:46 - ahead and set a run around from 24 to 14
04:49 - now whenever you roll a two three there
04:53 - isn't really a really great way to play
04:55 - this but there's one thing that I want
04:58 - to tell you guys to avoid you can do
05:00 - anything any play is good just don't
05:02 - move your 13 to your 8 this is the most
05:05 - worthless play it doesn't set up
05:07 - anything it doesn't really help you know
05:09 - building any strategy whatsoever so
05:12 - whenever you see your opponent roll a 2
05:14 - 3 2 open and then move the 13 to their 8
05:17 - you can say all right pretty much chalk
05:19 - it up as a win because you're playing
05:21 - with the newb now whenever you roll a 3
05:24 - 4 here's how I like to play this one -
05:26 - 313 tier 10 in your 24 to 20 now this
05:30 - chip is going to be relatively protected
05:31 - from getting hit from their ships on
05:33 - their 24 point and also you're setting
05:36 - up owning their 5 point which hopefully
05:38 - you can build on the next roll so don't
05:40 - forget to look for this on the next roll
05:42 - now whenever you roll a to 5 this is a
05:45 - pretty terrible roll it's probably the
05:47 - worst roll you can start out as but
05:49 - anyways whenever you get a 2 5 here so I
05:51 - like to play this I like to move my 13th
05:54 - to my 8 which again isn't really useful
05:56 - but hey we'll take it and I also like to
05:58 - move 13 to 11 this is a really defensive
06:01 - strategy but it's really the best player
06:04 - play this role now whenever you roll a 4
06:07 - 5 here's how I like to play this again
06:09 - not the best rowboat or take it what I
06:11 - like to do is play this one right here
06:14 - and also with my for my 24 - their 20 so
06:18 - what this does right here is we want to
06:21 - set up owning their 5 points since this
06:23 - is probably the second most important
06:25 - point owned in the game so look on the
06:28 - next roll when you get it forward
06:30 - to move your 24 to 20 and then we can on
06:32 - there
06:33 - point
