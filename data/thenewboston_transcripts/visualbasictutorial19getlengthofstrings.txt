00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:04 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to be taking
00:07 - another look at strings now we looked at
00:10 - strings in the last tutorial and for the
00:12 - next couple upcoming tutorials we are
00:14 - also going to look at some other stuff
00:15 - that you can do with strings so let's go
00:18 - ahead and get started now we're going to
00:20 - come up here and we're going to declare
00:22 - a variable so let's go ahead and dim uh
00:28 - username as
00:30 - string so now what we're going to do is
00:32 - we're going to prompt the user to enter
00:34 - in their
00:36 - username so we'll just do console. right
00:40 - line what is your
00:46 - username now username is going to be
00:49 - equal to console.readline so basically
00:53 - just get what they typed in now what
00:56 - we're going to do is we're going to test
00:57 - to see if their username is a certain
00:59 - length so we're just going to make a
01:01 - simple if statement so if
01:04 - username and now what we're going to do
01:06 - is we're going to add a period so if
01:10 - username Dot and you can see here that
01:12 - intellisense pops up with a whole bunch
01:14 - of stuff that we can do um you can copy
01:18 - you can do do contains there's a whole
01:20 - bunch of stuff that you can use um with
01:23 - strings and this is very
01:25 - useful so what we're going to use is
01:29 - username do length and now if you read
01:31 - the description for this it's going to
01:33 - say gets the number of characters in the
01:36 - current system.string
01:38 - object so if username Dolen equals
01:44 - 10 then go ahead and do something so
01:47 - we'll just do
01:49 - console. right
01:52 - line you have been granted access
02:02 - now what we're going to do is we're
02:03 - going to add console.readline
02:07 - so that our program won't close right
02:09 - when we're
02:10 - done so now it'll say what is your
02:12 - username and if I type in something
02:15 - that's 10 characters long so let's just
02:17 - say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
02:21 - 10 and if we press press enter it'll say
02:24 - you have been granted
02:27 - access now if we type
02:30 - anything else that's not equal to 10 so
02:32 - let's just do something more than 10
02:34 - it's not going to say anything so let's
02:36 - just go back in here and add a simple
02:40 - else now what we're going to do is we're
02:43 - going to do console. right
02:48 - line your
02:52 - username is not the right length
03:02 - so now if we run
03:04 - this it'll say what is your username so
03:08 - if we type something that's not 10
03:09 - characters long it'll say your username
03:11 - is not the right
03:13 - length now what we can also do instead
03:16 - of using IF username Dolen equals 10 we
03:19 - can just go ahead and do if usern
03:22 - username Dolen do
03:26 - equals and then inside of the arguments
03:28 - for equals It'll ask us for an object as
03:31 - an integer so we'll go ahead and do 10
03:35 - right there now this is just another way
03:37 - that you can test the length value of
03:39 - username and do equals can be used for a
03:41 - lot of other other things in Visual
03:43 - Basic so if we run this it should work
03:46 - so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and it'll say
03:51 - you have been gr granted
03:53 - access now this is a really simple
03:55 - simple tutorial and you shouldn't have
03:57 - to practice it and um go ahead and stay
04:00 - tuned for the next tutorial and thanks
04:01 - for watching
