00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:02 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're gonna be
00:07 - talking about stream readers now if you
00:09 - remember from the previous tutorials we
00:12 - learned how to write text to a text file
00:14 - well now we're going to be learning how
00:16 - to read text from a text file so we'll
00:20 - go ahead and create a new project we
00:23 - will select a windows forms application
00:25 - and we will call it streams again go
00:28 - ahead and click OK and looks like lots
00:32 - to do streams 1 click OK and wait for
00:35 - that to load okay so now now that is it
00:41 - has loaded we'll go ahead and add a text
00:45 - box we will make it multi-line and then
00:52 - we'll make it read-only so read-only is
00:58 - going to be equal to true and then we'll
01:01 - add a button and we will set the button
01:07 - name or the text we'll set the text to
01:10 - load file and we'll set the name to
01:14 - button load ok so now we'll just double
01:18 - click on load file and this will open up
01:21 - our click event handler for it now just
01:25 - like before to use any kind of any type
01:27 - of stream we're gonna have to type
01:30 - imports the system dot IO namespace so
01:36 - this gives us the classes that we can
01:37 - use to read and write to text files now
01:40 - there are a bunch of other ways to read
01:42 - and write to text files but this is just
01:44 - how we're learning it in these tutorials
01:46 - so we're gonna go ahead and declare a
01:49 - stream reader so private file to load as
01:54 - new stream reader and we'll go ahead and
01:59 - set the path of this to the same path
02:01 - that we used for the last tutorial so
02:05 - we're going to get my file dot txt in
02:07 - the g-drive now you can see that I have
02:10 - it right here and we
02:12 - can edit that with notepad plus plus and
02:15 - I have hello YouTube on life gamer and
02:17 - the new boss stand in there so we'll go
02:20 - ahead and close this out and we'll go
02:24 - ahead and minimize that so now that we
02:26 - have our stream reader and we have our
02:27 - location that we're going to load from
02:29 - whenever that I click load what we're
02:31 - going to do is type file to load dot
02:36 - read and you can see that we have read
02:39 - read block read line or read to end read
02:42 - reads only one character read block
02:45 - reads a maximum of count characters from
02:47 - the current stream so you can tell it to
02:51 - read a certain amount of characters you
02:53 - can read one line so it really reads
02:56 - until it hits an escape key or down to
02:58 - the next line and it ends reading and
03:02 - what we're going to use is read to end
03:04 - so it's going to read everything inside
03:06 - of the file so now that we've called
03:09 - read to end what we're going to need to
03:11 - do is put all that text inside of our
03:14 - text box so we'll type text box 1 dot
03:19 - text is going to be equal to whatever is
03:22 - in that file so let's go ahead and run
03:24 - this hopefully we won't get any errors
03:26 - and now when we click load file we get
03:29 - hello YouTube on live gamer and the new
03:32 - Boston so we can go ahead and close out
03:36 - of that and let's open my file again and
03:39 - we can edit it so we'll add a visual
03:42 - basic.net and programming so now that
03:53 - we've added some more stuff stuff to our
03:57 - text file let's go ahead and run this
04:00 - again and see if it shows up when we
04:02 - load the file so you can see that when
04:04 - we load the file we get hello YouTube on
04:06 - live gamer the new Boston visual
04:08 - basic.net and programming so go ahead
04:12 - and practice loading files using a
04:15 - stream reader you can also load files in
04:17 - add stuff to them and then save them
04:20 - after that so that's what I want you
04:23 - guys to do is make an app that will do
04:25 - that if you don't want to you can just
04:27 - go ahead and move on to the next
04:27 - tutorials if not and you make one feel
04:30 - free to leave it in a video response so
04:32 - thanks for watching it stays tuned for
04:34 - the next tutorial
