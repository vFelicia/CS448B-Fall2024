00:00 - what is going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - 65th and last tutorial for this udk
00:05 - beginner series now before you guys
00:07 - start freaking out trust me we are
00:09 - nowhere near finish learning the udk we
00:12 - have so much stuff to go over however
00:14 - every tutorial after this one is going
00:17 - to be rather advanced so what i want to
00:19 - do on my website is i'm going to split
00:21 - all these videos up one through 65 in
00:24 - the udk beginner series and then instead
00:26 - of making this series like 500 videos
00:28 - long i'm just going to be making another
00:31 - series that is going to be you know my
00:33 - intermediate and advanced series that
00:35 - i'm going to be putting the rest of the
00:36 - videos in so i just think that's a
00:38 - better way to organize these videos
00:41 - like i said instead of having just one
00:43 - series that's super long i'm going to be
00:45 - putting the rest of these videos that i
00:47 - make in an intermediate and advanced
00:49 - playlist so trust me guys we are nowhere
00:51 - near finished learning the uk this is
00:53 - basically just a way that i can organize
00:55 - my videos better because like i said
00:57 - from here on out things are going to get
00:59 - a little more advanced so if you're
01:01 - saying all right what exactly are we
01:03 - going to be learning because a lot of
01:05 - people have been messaging me and
01:06 - wanting to know
01:07 - i'm going to be going over things such
01:09 - as and this is just a few things physics
01:12 - um particle systems i'm gonna be
01:14 - teaching you guys how to create user
01:15 - interfaces i'm gonna be teaching you
01:17 - guys like when you have a character that
01:19 - we're gonna bring in how to animate him
01:21 - make his arms move walk around jump and
01:24 - after all that i'm also going to be
01:26 - making another series that is called
01:28 - unreal script now this is pretty much
01:32 - coding you know how kismet was kind of
01:34 - like visual coding well unreal script is
01:37 - unreal's custom programming language so
01:39 - i'm going to be teaching that in another
01:41 - series so again the plans for the udk
01:44 - are i'm going to finish up this series
01:45 - in this video and then we're going to be
01:47 - teaching intermediate concepts in
01:49 - intermediate udk series and then after
01:52 - that we're going to be teaching unreal
01:53 - script and if i have anything to teach
01:55 - after that it's probably going to be in
01:56 - advance
01:57 - so anyways i'm out of breath so that's
01:59 - actually why i made this video i wanted
02:01 - to explain that but i guess since we're
02:04 - already here i might as well teach you
02:05 - guys about you know i might as well
02:07 - teach you guys something since this is a
02:09 - tutorial so
02:11 - i know that i told you guys that i was
02:12 - going to be going over these volumes but
02:14 - a lot of these volumes
02:16 - kind of have concepts that go behind
02:18 - them that i can't really explain now for
02:20 - example physics volumes i can't teach
02:23 - this because i didn't teach you guys
02:24 - about physics yet
02:25 - um level streaming of course we need to
02:28 - know about level streaming which is like
02:30 - kind of a way to optimize your game
02:32 - light mass deals with
02:34 - lighting basically but i again so a lot
02:37 - of these volumes the concepts that go
02:39 - behind it i didn't teach you guys yet so
02:41 - i can't really go over all of them in a
02:43 - way that you can understand
02:45 - however one of the most common volumes
02:47 - if not the most common volumes is
02:49 - blocking volume so i guess i can finish
02:51 - up the series with that
02:52 - blocking volume is just basically a
02:54 - volume that deals with collision and we
02:57 - already know what collision is so let me
02:59 - go ahead and right click my builder
03:01 - brush and i'm going to set this equal to
03:02 - 512
03:04 - and 512 and 256 for height looks pretty
03:06 - good so just go ahead and build that
03:08 - and now if i pop b and open my builder
03:11 - brush
03:12 - actually i want to bring this down
03:17 - right there
03:18 - i'm trying to make a force field around
03:21 - this object right here so i'm just gonna
03:23 - center it in all my
03:25 - hey might as well move my stacked mesh
03:27 - if i need to
03:28 - and
03:30 - right there so
03:31 - this
03:32 - volume is pretty much surrounding the
03:34 - static mesh i just want to get somewhere
03:35 - in the center just so i can demonstrate
03:37 - so now we have to go ahead and add a
03:39 - blocking volume so if you go ahead and
03:40 - select your builder brush and right
03:42 - click on your volumes just go ahead and
03:44 - hit blocking volume and it's going to
03:46 - add a blocking volume so if we go ahead
03:48 - and slide up our builder brush or we can
03:50 - just go ahead and hit b to delete it
03:53 - or excuse me hide it rather then we can
03:56 - see that we now have a blocking volume
03:58 - around the static mesh so you're saying
04:00 - all right so does this block everything
04:03 - or only vehicles or you know does it
04:05 - block bullets well in order to tell it
04:09 - what we want it to block go ahead and
04:11 - select it and hit f4 this is going to
04:13 - bring up the properties for that
04:14 - blocking volume
04:16 - now under collision
04:18 - this is where we tell it what we want it
04:20 - to block now no collision is worthless
04:23 - because if it was no collision it
04:26 - basically
04:27 - we wouldn't have even had to make a
04:29 - collision whatsoever or volume so this
04:31 - is pretty much means anything can get
04:33 - through it
04:34 - block all blocks everything
04:37 - well i can't explain it better than that
04:39 - so the two most common volumes you
04:41 - probably want to use or excuse me types
04:43 - of collision is block all which means
04:45 - nothing can get through it and for this
04:48 - example i'm going to go ahead and just
04:49 - choose block all but weapons so what
04:52 - that means is whenever we play our level
04:55 - our character is going to bump into it
04:57 - and not be able to get through it but it
04:59 - can shoot through if it wants to so let
05:00 - me go ahead and hit play from here and
05:03 - i'll show you guys
05:04 - and let me go ahead and rebuild my
05:06 - lighting since i didn't move that static
05:07 - mesh
05:09 - so i guess that now i can
05:12 - i was getting caught now so that's a
05:13 - nice little break from that but yeah
05:16 - like i said i can't teach you all these
05:18 - volumes yet because
05:19 - i need to teach you guys the concepts
05:21 - and once i'm done teaching the concepts
05:23 - the volumes will just make sense to you
05:25 - so let me go ahead and hit play from
05:26 - here and now my static mesh is lit up
05:28 - and remember we have an invisible force
05:31 - field around the static mesh now which
05:33 - if we try to run into it
05:35 - look my user is stopping right there he
05:38 - can't get to that static mesh because
05:39 - that their invisible box is behind it or
05:41 - excuse me around it so now let me go
05:43 - ahead and try to run it from this side
05:46 - not happening haas so what i can do is
05:48 - since i set up block all but weapons i
05:51 - can shoot through it and check it out
05:54 - my weapon still hits it
05:56 - and leaves a mark right on the aesthetic
05:58 - mesh however
06:00 - it does block
06:01 - my user from getting to it so again this
06:04 - isn't really useful and you probably
06:06 - wouldn't set up a volume they actually
06:08 - did this because by the way static
06:11 - meshes already have collision built into
06:13 - them by default so i just want to
06:16 - explain you guys what a blocking volume
06:18 - was because you know it's probably the
06:20 - most common type of volume that we're
06:22 - gonna be using i just mumble that that
06:24 - you're gonna be using so i thought i'd
06:25 - get that out of the way but anyways
06:27 - that's all i have for you guys for this
06:29 - tutorial thank you guys so much for
06:30 - watching and thank you guys for
06:32 - completing my udk beginner series so
06:35 - from now
06:36 - what you need to do is move on to my udk
06:39 - intermediate series to get all the rest
06:41 - of my videos so again one last time
06:43 - thank you guys for watching and i trust
06:45 - me we are nowhere near
06:47 - done learning the udk we have so much to
06:49 - look forward to so uh with that being
06:52 - said i guess i'll see you guys in next
06:53 - series
