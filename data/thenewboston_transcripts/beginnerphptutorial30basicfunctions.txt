00:00 - hello there this is Alex from PHP
00:02 - academy.org I'm creating this PHP video
00:05 - for the new Boston now in this video I'm
00:08 - going to be talking Loosely about
00:09 - functions uh why they're useful in PHP
00:12 - or in fact any other programming
00:14 - language and also how we can create a
00:17 - function and use a function within our
00:19 - page now first of all what is a function
00:21 - a function is something that allows us
00:23 - to declare um a block of code that we
00:25 - might want to reuse um we can feed in
00:28 - parameters to this um or arguments as
00:30 - they're sometimes referred to or usually
00:32 - referred to um and then we can use this
00:36 - at different parts in our code to save
00:38 - us retyping code out um and as per the
00:42 - name functions they will do something so
00:45 - you know they will do something that
00:46 - will allow you to declare them um and
00:49 - then reuse them over and over so the
00:51 - standard uh Syntax for a function is
00:53 - function we have two brackets and then
00:55 - we have a block here denoted by two
00:58 - curly brackets and opening and a closing
01:01 - now inside here we'll go our arguments
01:03 - in this video I'm not going to be
01:04 - dealing with arguments I'm just going to
01:05 - show you uh how we're using a function
01:08 - and uh how to call it so we already know
01:11 - that a function is used to speed up um
01:15 - basically our writing of our program
01:18 - by keeping some code that's going to let
01:20 - us um or declaring the function and a
01:25 - lot of code now what we haven't done is
01:27 - given this function a name I forgot to
01:28 - mention that um we're going to give this
01:30 - function a name and this is going to be
01:32 - uh called um my name um you can write it
01:36 - any way you want um small uh with camel
01:40 - caps um anything really so we'll use a
01:44 - capital m and a capital N just so we can
01:46 - see so it's really important that you
01:48 - name your functions well uh my name
01:50 - doesn't really tell you what I'm going
01:52 - to do um but you
01:55 - know it it could it could do it it might
01:58 - not it depends on who the if you're
02:00 - writing to an audience say you people
02:03 - are going to see your code as long as
02:04 - you know what it is and if if it's
02:05 - staying personal to you that's
02:06 - absolutely fine so in this I'm just
02:09 - going to Simply Echo out Alex now let's
02:13 - just suppose in my code uh let's just
02:15 - bring this down I want to um I want to
02:19 - Echo out Alex a few times so for example
02:24 - um
02:25 - echo my name
02:28 - is and I want to break down now I'm just
02:31 - going to call my function my name down
02:35 - here now what this is going to do is
02:37 - it's going to Echo out my name is it's
02:39 - going to line break down and then it's
02:42 - going to call this function we call it
02:45 - simply by its name and then just two
02:47 - brackets like that arguments would
02:49 - usually go in here but in this purpose
02:51 - of this short tutorial I'm not talking
02:53 - about arguments and then as always we
02:55 - end with a semicolon so the the result I
02:58 - want from this is
03:00 - to Echo out my name basically after this
03:04 - sentence here so let's test if it works
03:06 - we
03:07 - refresh and you can see it says my name
03:09 - is Alex now obviously we could take away
03:12 - this line break um and just include a
03:15 - space here and you can see that it has
03:17 - exactly the same use um this is
03:19 - obviously a useless um function it would
03:23 - be a lot easier to declare it um or not
03:26 - declare it but type my name over and
03:28 - over again if I need to um but this
03:31 - example just demonstrates how to create
03:34 - a basic function and what it does I mean
03:36 - for example in our function we could
03:39 - want we might want to Echo out a
03:41 - specific variable um that we don't want
03:44 - to keep
03:45 - redeclaring um in our page uh but then
03:49 - again that might be useless as well so I
03:51 - mean functions can be used for different
03:53 - things um obviously depending on your
03:56 - program you just have to think logically
03:57 - about it but for now this is an example
03:59 - example of how you declare a function
04:02 - I've talked about why they're useful um
04:04 - and in the next video we're going to
04:06 - look at passing arguments to functions
04:08 - to create something that's maybe a bit
04:10 - more of use
