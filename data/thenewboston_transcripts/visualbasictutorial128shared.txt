00:00 - hello YouTube say I'm here from
00:02 - youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
00:04 - new Boston and in this tutorial we're
00:06 - gonna be talking about shared variables
00:08 - properties and methods so let's go ahead
00:11 - and create a new project we will select
00:15 - a windows forms application and we will
00:18 - call it shared and we'll go ahead and
00:20 - click OK we'll wait for that to load and
00:28 - let's open up our form or VB file now
00:32 - let's just go ahead and zoom in some and
00:35 - we'll create a class inside of here
00:37 - so that we don't have to create a
00:39 - another file so let's go ahead and make
00:43 - it public so public class and we'll just
00:47 - call it person so now what we want to do
00:50 - is make some public variables so public
00:55 - P named as string and then public shared
01:03 - min age as let's make it an integer and
01:09 - we'll go ahead and set it equal to
01:10 - something let's set it equal to 16 so
01:13 - when we share it what this means is that
01:15 - no matter how many instances or objects
01:18 - a person we make min age is only going
01:22 - to be stored once it's gonna be shared
01:24 - throughout all of them so let's say we
01:25 - if we didn't make it shared and we made
01:27 - a hundred person objects we would have a
01:30 - hundred copies of min age but because we
01:32 - make it shared no matter how many
01:34 - objects a person we create there's only
01:36 - going to be one instance of minimum age
01:38 - and if we just changed it once then it's
01:41 - going to go ahead and change it
01:42 - throughout all the classes so now what
01:45 - we can do is let's go ahead and come up
01:51 - here to the form unload so when the form
01:55 - one loads what we want to do is add that
01:57 - a bunch of people to a list box so first
02:01 - we're going to need a list box so we'll
02:04 - drag it over here and we will make it a
02:07 - little bit bigger so we'll go ahead and
02:10 - create a for loop right here
02:13 - so for int index as integer and we'll
02:19 - just go ahead and set it equal to 50 or
02:22 - no one 250 what we're gonna do is create
02:26 - a new person object so dim new purse as
02:30 - new person and what we're gonna do is
02:34 - we're gonna set the name and the we're
02:37 - gonna set the name of it and we're going
02:39 - to add it to an ArrayList so let's come
02:42 - up here and we will type private purse
02:46 - array as new ArrayList so now we're
02:54 - going to do is we're going to set the
02:55 - name of that person so let's just do new
02:59 - purse dot name or dot P name is going to
03:02 - be equal to and we'll just do Sam and
03:06 - we'll go ahead and add the current int
03:10 - index so and int index so it'll just
03:15 - give the numbers of Sam so whenever we
03:24 - after we've set the name for the person
03:27 - let's go ahead and add that person to
03:29 - the list so purse array dot add and then
03:33 - we'll do a new person so now we need to
03:37 - update the list box so let's just call
03:39 - update list now we haven't created this
03:42 - yet so let's come down here and create
03:44 - it so we'll go right before this or
03:47 - right out to the sub we will type
03:48 - private sub update list now what we want
03:55 - to do to update the list is type list
03:59 - box 1 dot items dot clear so we can get
04:04 - everything out of the list and now what
04:06 - we need to do is we need to add all of
04:08 - those users back to the list box so the
04:12 - way we're going to do this is type use a
04:15 - for each loop so for each the person as
04:24 - person in our person array we're gonna
04:28 - go ahead and add that to the list box so
04:33 - list box 1 dot items dot add and we will
04:39 - add the person dot name and then we'll
04:45 - go ahead and add a space or will add
04:51 - minimum age and we'll add the person dot
05:00 - min age and let's see here
05:14 - okay hold on okay so let's go ahead and
05:17 - just ignore this warning right here
05:19 - because it's gonna work either way
05:21 - so let's come back over here to our form
05:23 - 1 DB and let's add a numeric up-down
05:31 - picker so we'll go ahead and set the the
05:37 - value that has been selected so whatever
05:40 - the form 1 loads we will go ahead and
05:44 - set numeric up-down 1 dot value and
05:57 - we're going to set that equal to new
06:02 - purse dot min age now you can see we're
06:08 - gonna get an error because new person is
06:10 - not initialized yet so we'll just cut
06:13 - that and we will paste it right down
06:17 - here okay so it's gonna go ahead and set
06:23 - this to the automatic minimum age now
06:28 - let's go ahead and click the lightning
06:30 - bolt right here and whenever the value
06:32 - has changed what we want to do is set
06:35 - the value of minimum age now right here
06:43 - I forgot to mention this because it's
06:46 - shared
06:46 - instead of type of new person will just
06:48 - type person dot minimum age and this
06:50 - will access all person all person
06:53 - objects the minimum age and all of them
06:56 - so we'll just type person and what we
07:00 - want to do is set person dot min age
07:04 - equal to numeric up/down 1 dot value so
07:13 - whatever the value is in there it's
07:14 - going to set the minimum age to that and
07:16 - then after we do that we want to update
07:19 - list so I messed up a couple of times in
07:24 - here because I didn't really review this
07:26 - before I went to make this
07:27 - toriel but just remember that you used
07:29 - the whole class instead of the object of
07:31 - the class that you have so let's go
07:34 - ahead and run this and you can see here
07:38 - that we've got Sam all the way to 50 and
07:40 - it's got the minimum age is 16 now you
07:43 - can see that when we update this it's
07:45 - gonna update all of them so I set the
07:47 - minimum age equal to whatever you set it
07:48 - and there's only one instance of minimum
07:51 - age so we can keep changing this as much
07:56 - as we want and it's only changing one
07:57 - value now shared can also be applied to
08:02 - methods functions properties pretty much
08:05 - anything that did you that you can put
08:07 - in a class can be marked as shared so
08:11 - that only one copy is made so go ahead
08:15 - practices a little bit with shared and
08:16 - then once we got that down go ahead and
08:18 - move on to the next tutorial
