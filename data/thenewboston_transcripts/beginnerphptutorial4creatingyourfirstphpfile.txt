00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org and
00:03 - back with another video for the new
00:05 - Boston now in this tutorial we uh going
00:08 - to go on from our previous tutorial
00:10 - where we installed xamp for Windows now
00:13 - now that we're at this stage where we've
00:15 - uh installed the um installed xamp we've
00:18 - accessed Local Host we've tested that
00:20 - PHP my admin work so we we've run our um
00:24 - our MySQL databases for when we look at
00:26 - databases a lot later on and we've also
00:29 - um brought with attention the xamp
00:31 - control panel here uh which allows us to
00:33 - start and stop particular services and
00:36 - um the services that we've focused on
00:38 - are Apache and MySQL because these are
00:40 - two that we're going to use most
00:42 - frequently okay so now this tutorial is
00:45 - basically going to cover how to create
00:46 - your PHP your first PHP file um and
00:50 - we're going to do some little bit of
00:51 - output in it nothing major because we
00:53 - have other tutorials explaining uh sort
00:55 - of um output um and uh the PHP info
01:00 - function as well so have a look at the
01:02 - other tutorials and you'll uh you'll
01:03 - find some great information on that okay
01:06 - so uh let's go ahead and we need to
01:08 - think about opening up this um folder
01:11 - here let me just uh bring it into view
01:13 - this folder here called examp and this
01:15 - is a c colon back/ xamp by default
01:18 - depending on how you installed uh your
01:20 - xamp installation depending on how you
01:22 - run the installation uh this might be
01:24 - different but by default it's C column
01:26 - back/ xamp or whatever Drive you've inst
01:30 - it to so replace this with your drive
01:32 - number uh letter sorry okay so in here
01:35 - we've got a few folders you can see uh
01:37 - some of which are useful to us some of
01:38 - which are not we have our PHP
01:41 - installation folder which contains all
01:44 - our dlls um
01:46 - php.ini so let's find that got php.ini
01:51 - here um etc etc so um there's another
01:56 - tutorial on php.ini so go and check that
01:58 - out okay okay so um HT docs is the uh
02:02 - folder that I want to focus on in this
02:03 - tutorial because we're going to be
02:05 - creating our first file now inside HT
02:08 - docs at the moment it's a bit of a mess
02:09 - for me I've got a few files in here but
02:12 - we want to create our um PHP file in
02:14 - here so um in let's just open up uh our
02:19 - browser so you know now that we access
02:21 - our uh website from or our local server
02:24 - from Local Host now we don't need to do
02:27 - localhost slht docs sln our file because
02:32 - HT docs here um well no in here is where
02:38 - is the root directory if you like for
02:41 - where our file should be so let's go
02:43 - ahead here and I'll create a new text
02:46 - document and I'm going to call this um
02:50 - my first
02:52 - file.php now in Windows I have uh
02:55 - extension naming uh enabled so I can
02:57 - automatically name my extension but if
03:00 - you can't do it this way you can see
03:01 - I've got if you change a far name
03:02 - extension blah blah blah click yes and
03:04 - that's changed now to a PHP file now
03:07 - this C icon you see is my text editor my
03:10 - default text editor and my default text
03:12 - editor is
03:14 - context so um usually you know you might
03:17 - have notepad is your default text editor
03:19 - but I recommend if you're going to start
03:21 - learning PHP download a good um a good
03:24 - text editor I use context I've always
03:26 - used context and I prefer it however
03:28 - Some people prefer to use notepad++ or
03:31 - even just notepad and I mean there are
03:32 - many out there that you can use uh
03:34 - depending on what platform you're in as
03:36 - well you might be running a Linux system
03:38 - uh so you may have different text Avail
03:40 - editors available to you so I've created
03:43 - this file um like this now what you can
03:45 - do is uh let's delete that and let's go
03:48 - over to um let's go over to my text
03:52 - editor so I've got my text editor open
03:54 - here I'm going to create a new file um
03:57 - and I'm going to save this I'm going to
03:59 - go save save as and I'm in my HT docs uh
04:02 - folder here so I'm going to type my
04:04 - first file.php and then down here I'm
04:08 - going to save as type all files to make
04:09 - sure that the extension's read now watch
04:12 - what happens to this just up here this
04:14 - text files bit here when I click save so
04:17 - let's uh get this into view as well I'm
04:19 - going to click save and you can see
04:20 - that's automatically changed syntax
04:23 - highlighting for my file so now the PHP
04:26 - extension is applied we can see that
04:29 - that file's been created there for us
04:31 - the extension has been applied and now
04:33 - syntax highlighting has been turned out
04:35 - on now syntax highlighting if you've
04:37 - ever program before you'll know
04:38 - highlight specific parts of the syntax
04:40 - so Constructors um variables uh string
04:44 - data and integers things like that just
04:47 - everything will be highlighted
04:48 - differently um depending on how your
04:51 - text editor handles that and you can
04:53 - modify that as well uh from options
04:55 - menus but we're not here to talk about
04:56 - that we're here to talk about the first
04:58 - PHP file now inside our PHP file um
05:02 - let's just actually go to our browser
05:04 - first and try and access this so we know
05:06 - this is saved in um c/ examp and HT docs
05:11 - so let's go ahead to our browser and
05:13 - type in um my first file.php so remember
05:17 - HT docs is the root folder so all we
05:19 - need to do is say localhost slm myfirst
05:22 - file.php we press enter and this file
05:25 - has been loaded in now because it's a
05:27 - PHP extension you might think that you
05:29 - can't put HTML data in but we can in
05:32 - fact write uh data into here and just
05:34 - either plain text or HTML and when we
05:37 - refresh that's displayed on the page so
05:39 - you can see now that we're accessing our
05:41 - uh files like we would on a normal
05:42 - server and uh again you can create
05:45 - folders directories in here and and uh
05:47 - create things uh as you wish so to
05:50 - create the first PHP file we've done
05:52 - this and our tags look like
05:54 - this um you'll notice that we've have um
05:58 - a less than SI
06:00 - um a question mark PHP and then we end
06:02 - on a question mark in here so that's
06:04 - very similar to how we open up and close
06:07 - HTML um so we open up tags like that and
06:10 - end tags like that in PHP we do this but
06:13 - that's not what this tutorial is about
06:15 - we've created our file we've accessed it
06:18 - from our um from our web server and now
06:21 - um you can go on the tutorials where we
06:23 - talk about um echoing out data to the
06:26 - user and uh so on and so forth and you
06:28 - can start your journey learning
06:30 - PHP
