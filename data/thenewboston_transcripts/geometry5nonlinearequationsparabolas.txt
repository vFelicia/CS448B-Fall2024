00:01 - so now we're going to move on to
00:03 - equations of
00:05 - nonlinear graphs so the first type of
00:09 - nonlinear equation we're going to talk
00:11 - about is called a
00:13 - parabola so and the most basic form of a
00:16 - parabola is y =
00:19 - x^2 so we're going to graph this
00:22 - equation right
00:25 - here so if I plug in
00:28 - zero I'm going to get y y =
00:31 - 0 so I have 0
00:33 - 0 if I plug in one I'm going to get one
00:37 - y = 1^ 2 so y = 1 so I have
00:43 - 1 1 if I plug
00:47 - in1 if you remember any number squared
00:50 - is going to be positive so I'll get ne1
00:54 - 1 if I plug in
00:57 - two I don't know why I wrote it like
00:59 - that that I'm get y = 4 so
01:04 - 2 4 same thing if I plug a negative
01:09 - 1 and this is what a parabola looks
01:13 - like miss my DOT right
01:17 - there it's like a like a
01:23 - u so now we're going to
01:28 - graph
01:30 - Y = 2 so y =
01:35 - 2x^2 we're going to do the same kind of
01:38 - thing plug in points so Y = 2 * 0 so 0
01:44 - 0 Y = 2 1 Y =
01:53 - 2 same thing's going to happen if I plug
01:58 - in1 2
02:00 - 2^ 2 so 2 * 2^ 2 which is 4 is 8 oh this
02:05 - is going to be off my little chart I'm
02:08 - just going to put it up here and then
02:11 - same thing if I plug in
02:13 - -2 so when we put a big number
02:19 - out out front the graph's going to get
02:23 - skinnier and the way I like to think of
02:25 - it when you have a bigger number in
02:28 - front of an X you have more exercise and
02:31 - if you have more exercise you're going
02:33 - to be skinnier so whenever you have like
02:36 - a four out front you're going to have a
02:38 - skinnier graph but if you had like a 1/
02:41 - half out front you get less exercise so
02:45 - you're going to be
02:48 - wider
02:49 - okay now we're going to
02:54 - dox2 okay so here if we plug in negative
03:00 - if we plug in one we're going to at y =
03:03 - -1 so one same thing's going to happen
03:07 - if we plug in positive one and if you
03:11 - keep going you'd get the same Parabola
03:13 - it's just reflected across the X
03:19 - AIS so when you have a negative out
03:22 - front it's going to you're going to have
03:25 - a downwards Parabola if you have a
03:28 - positive out front it's going to be
03:30 - up all right and now we're going to do
03:33 - two more
03:35 - ones okay
03:38 - so each Parabola has its vertex which is
03:44 - where there's just one point and then
03:46 - your graph goes like up from that one
03:49 - point like that so so far every one of
03:53 - our graphs has had a z0 Vertex but if
03:56 - you plug zero into this you're going to
04:00 - get 0 + 2^ 2ar so y = 4 so 0 1 2 three
04:10 - 4 it's going
04:18 - to actually forget about that
04:23 - okay so whenever you have a number
04:27 - inside your parentheses if it's a
04:30 - positive it's G to shift your graph two
04:34 - to the
04:35 - left if it's negative it's going to
04:38 - shift your graph to the right
04:41 - so your
04:44 - um your Y intercept if you set y equal
04:49 - or your x intercept if you set y equal
04:55 - zero get 0 = x + 2 x = 2 so
05:06 - -2 okay so if you have a A plus two here
05:12 - it's going to shift your graph two to
05:14 - the left so your vertex is going to be 0
05:18 - one 2 so then your graph is going to
05:21 - look something like this just shift it
05:23 - over if you haveg -3 it's going to shift
05:26 - it to the right
05:28 - three
05:34 - and that's all we're going to do with
05:36 - parabas um make sure you come back and
05:38 - watch our next video where we talk about
05:40 - circles
