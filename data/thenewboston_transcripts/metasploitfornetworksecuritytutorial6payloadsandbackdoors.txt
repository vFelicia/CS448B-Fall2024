00:00 - all right hostas welcome back and in
00:02 - this video I am going to be teaching you
00:04 - guys about payloads and I'll also show
00:06 - you guys how to get back door into
00:08 - Metasploit able so if you don't have
00:10 - Metasploit about up and running go watch
00:12 - my last video but once you do the first
00:15 - thing like I said that you need to do is
00:17 - you need to get the IP address of that
00:20 - and we found out in the last video that
00:23 - it was one two one six eight one five
00:26 - two dot one two nine now another thing
00:29 - that you're going to need to do is
00:30 - you're going to need to get the IP
00:31 - address of your own Kali Linux machine
00:35 - so this is one I 2 1 6 8 1 5 2 dot 1 2 8
00:39 - so pretty easy to remember but what I
00:42 - did before this video even started is I
00:44 - just wrote those down now the reason
00:47 - that we need to get the IP addresses of
00:49 - both the Machine we're at right now and
00:51 - our targets machine is because what
00:53 - we're going to be doing in just a second
00:55 - is we're going to be getting a backdoor
00:57 - into this machine so once we do that we
01:02 - need to say ok for the exploit we're
01:04 - going to use this is the target and this
01:07 - is where we're going to listen or
01:08 - control
01:09 - that machine from so make sure you have
01:11 - that and once you do you are good to go
01:15 - so clear out of there and by the way
01:18 - chances are the IP addresses are going
01:20 - to be different for your setup so just
01:23 - don't copy those IP addresses since
01:26 - yours might be a little bit different
01:27 - and I remember I don't even have
01:29 - Metasploit started yet so service post
01:32 - Jerry SQL start up that database
01:36 - dunt dunt dunt dunt down and MSF console
01:42 - so this is going to start database for
01:44 - the exploits and this is going to launch
01:46 - the Metasploit command line framework
01:49 - console starting the Medus with
01:52 - framework on so we're about to get a
01:55 - book the back door got a bunny nice
01:58 - alright
01:59 - so clear out of there now I happen to
02:02 - know that the exploit is unreal three
02:06 - point two point one point eight now a
02:10 - word of warning
02:12 - this is an older exploit so it's not
02:15 - going to work a lot on you know modern
02:17 - systems I think it was found in like
02:18 - 2009 but the reason I want to show you
02:21 - this is just because I need to teach you
02:23 - about payloads and I know that this one
02:24 - has a payload we can use and also just
02:27 - to get a little familiar with Metasploit
02:29 - Abul so anyways like I said you're not
02:32 - going to find a lot of systems with this
02:34 - exploit but it's going to help us learn
02:36 - what we need to learn so all right so I
02:40 - guess the disclosure was in 2010
02:42 - excellent looking good so let's just get
02:45 - a little bit of info about it before we
02:47 - start using it so we can see that all
02:51 - right so any system running unreal this
02:55 - version there's exploit where it gives
02:57 - where it allows us to have a malicious
02:59 - backdoor that sounds amazing let's go
03:02 - ahead and use it so we want to use it
03:05 - boom roasted now before we can and
03:08 - remember like I said the first thing
03:10 - that you should always do whenever you
03:12 - use exploit is just write show options
03:15 - so what this does is it gives us the
03:17 - information that it needs in order to
03:19 - work properly so it says that we're
03:22 - missing one piece of information right
03:23 - here and that is the targets address so
03:26 - if I open this back up we know that the
03:31 - IP address of our target is one I - 1 6
03:34 - a 1 5 - 1 2 9 all right so I'm going to
03:39 - set our host to 192 168 1 5 2 1 2 9
03:45 - that's the Machine that we're going to
03:47 - be attacking so now let me clear out of
03:49 - here and show options ok Bucky can you
03:54 - type sausage fingers and our a so we
03:56 - have all the information that we need
03:58 - so before we learned about this cheat
04:02 - just the these basic options and how can
04:04 - how we can set them how we can edit them
04:06 - whatever but now we need to take it one
04:09 - step further and actually need to set
04:11 - something called a payload now so I'm
04:16 - going to go ahead and write show
04:17 - payloads and it's going to go through
04:19 - and list a bunch of these things all
04:22 - right so before we go any further what
04:24 - the heck is a payload
04:25 - a payload is something you can do once
04:29 - the exploit work so the exploit what we
04:33 - set up so far it's basically just
04:34 - gaining access into the system but now
04:38 - you have to ask alright once I have
04:40 - access to the system I probably want to
04:42 - do something right well yes we do and
04:45 - what we're going to do for our payload
04:47 - or kind of the ending or result is words
04:51 - just going to get a back door right
04:55 - through this payload so basically what
04:58 - we're trying to do is have full control
05:00 - over the system that's all we're saying
05:02 - easy enough so sounds pretty cool and in
05:06 - order to set a payload no nothing it's
05:12 - not too hard to remember just right set
05:13 - payload and then paste the name of it
05:15 - right there so hit enter that's what
05:19 - we're going to be using and just like
05:20 - the main exploit payloads also have
05:24 - options so if we were a show options
05:26 - then we can see that this is the main
05:29 - tool that we're using to gain access and
05:32 - these are our payload options so what
05:37 - now it says okay this is the computer
05:38 - you want to attack or try to find an
05:40 - exploit but now whenever you get access
05:44 - what address are you going to listen
05:46 - from and we're just going to do it from
05:48 - our own computer so copy this and you
05:55 - know simple stuff so set L host to our
06:03 - IP address 192 168 1 5 2 1 2 8
06:11 - show options in our egg so this is our
06:14 - attack this is our payload and make sure
06:16 - that you have everything set properly
06:18 - and then once you do just right to
06:21 - exploit now let it run and don'tdon't uh
06:25 - let me do my thing all right so see if I
06:30 - can scroll down a little bit it's kind
06:34 - of weird having this on uh alright
06:36 - whatever so the tools running and you
06:40 - know it looks like it completed and what
06:42 - the heck did this thing like pause or
06:43 - something all I'm looking at is a
06:45 - blinking line at the bottom of the
06:47 - screen now it says that a session is
06:50 - open um all right what exactly is going
06:54 - on well believe it or not this blinking
06:56 - line that you're looking at this is
06:59 - actually a terminal to our targets
07:01 - machine so check this out if you just
07:03 - type Who am I
07:04 - it says root now it's not for my Kali
07:09 - Linux machine this is actually we are in
07:12 - the other server Metasploit Abel
07:14 - so let me just look around LS and all
07:19 - right so all of these files that we're
07:21 - looking at right here these aren't files
07:22 - on my computer these are files on the
07:25 - target computer so we now successfully
07:28 - have gained back door into another
07:31 - remote system so from here I mean you
07:34 - can do anything you want you can start
07:36 - deleting files you can look around you
07:38 - can you know I'll leave it up to your
07:41 - imagination but that ladies and
07:43 - gentlemen is the basics of what a
07:46 - payload is and also how to use
07:48 - Metasploit to gain access into
07:50 - Metasploit able and there are a bunch of
07:52 - other vulnerabilities and exploits that
07:54 - we're going to be covering later on but
07:56 - for now that's all you guys get thank
07:58 - you for watching I'll see you next video
