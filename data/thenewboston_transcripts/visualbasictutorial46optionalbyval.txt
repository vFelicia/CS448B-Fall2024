00:00 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to be taking a
00:08 - look at default parameters now basically
00:10 - what this means is let's say you're
00:13 - creating a sub or a function and you
00:15 - want the user or the developer to be
00:18 - able
00:19 - to pass a value to that function but you
00:23 - don't want to force them to do that so
00:25 - you can give them the option to give you
00:27 - let's say a title for example so if they
00:30 - want to give you a title then it will go
00:33 - ahead and let them pass that to the
00:35 - function but if they don't give you
00:37 - anything for that spot it's not going to
00:39 - return it's not going to give them an
00:41 - error it's going to set the default
00:43 - value for it so let's go ahead and make
00:46 - a little demo application for this so
00:48 - we'll type we'll go ahead and select new
00:52 - project we will name it
00:56 - optional make sure you have selected
00:58 - Windows forms application
01:00 - and then click
01:02 - okay so now what we're going to do is
01:04 - we're going to come over here to our
01:05 - form one we'll resize it some and we'll
01:08 - open up the toolbox now what we're going
01:10 - to do is we're going to add a text box
01:13 - and another text box now the first text
01:16 - box is going to be our title and the
01:18 - second text box is going to be our
01:20 - message now I'll just add a button
01:22 - called show message
01:31 - so we'll resize that a bit so it'll fit
01:33 - in and we're going to go come over here
01:35 - to our textbox one and we'll rename that
01:38 - to text
01:39 - title and we'll re rename this one to
01:43 - text
01:44 - message so now let's close out of our
01:47 - toolbox and we'll double click on show
01:49 - message to open up the event handler for
01:51 - that and once we're in here I'll zoom
01:54 - in so now what we're going to do is we
01:57 - are going to create a sub so we're going
01:59 - to to start off with the keyword private
02:02 - and then we'll use sub and we'll call it
02:05 - show message and now what we're going to
02:08 - do is we are going
02:10 - to force the caller of this sub to enter
02:14 - in a message so we'll do by by Val
02:18 - message as
02:20 - string and then we're going to have them
02:23 - enter in a title now they can enter in a
02:26 - title if they want but they don't have
02:27 - to and the way we do this is by using in
02:30 - the keyword optional so we'll type
02:32 - optional by
02:34 - Val title as
02:37 - string so they can call show message
02:41 - with only one argument and it'll still
02:43 - work fine so we'll go ahead and press
02:47 - enter and then we'll type end
02:54 - sub now what we need to do is set a
02:58 - default value for our typ title now you
03:00 - cannot use optional unless you have a
03:02 - default value set so what we're going to
03:04 - do is we're going to add an equal sign
03:06 - here so optional by Val title as string
03:09 - is going to be equal to default
03:14 - title and so now we'll just do
03:18 - messagebox Dosh
03:20 - show message and title now this isn't
03:24 - very practical but it's to teach you the
03:27 - concept of optionals and um using
03:32 - default
03:34 - parameters so now let's go up here to
03:36 - our button one click and we're going to
03:38 - call show message but there's a couple
03:40 - things we need to do first we will
03:43 - declare a variable so
03:46 - dim message as string and it's going to
03:50 - be equal to
03:52 - text text message. text now we're going
03:56 - to create a title uh variable so dim
04:01 - title as string and it's going to be
04:04 - equal to
04:05 - nothing so now what we're going to do is
04:08 - we're going to create a simple if
04:09 - statement to see if the user has typed
04:11 - anything in the title so what how we do
04:14 - this is we're going to do if text title.
04:18 - textlength is greater than
04:22 - zero then go ahead and do this now what
04:25 - this does is it gets the length of the
04:27 - text inside that text box and you can
04:29 - see that says text length as integer
04:31 - gets the length of the text in the
04:33 - control so if they actually entered
04:35 - something in a text title then what
04:37 - we're going to do is title is equal
04:41 - to text tile.
04:44 - text now what we're going to do is we're
04:47 - going to show message so show
04:50 - message and then we'll do message and
04:55 - title now what if they didn't type
04:58 - anything into the text title to handle
05:01 - this we're just going to add an
05:08 - else so we'll just type else right here
05:11 - so if text title. text length is greater
05:15 - is um equal to zero or less than zero
05:18 - which it cannot be less than zero it's
05:20 - either zero or something greater than
05:21 - that so if it is equal to zero then
05:24 - we'll just go ahead and show message and
05:28 - then we'll pass mage message to it and
05:30 - no title and it will show it will set
05:33 - the title to default title so let's go
05:35 - ahead and run
05:37 - this and here's our form right here if
05:40 - we go ahead and set something as the
05:42 - title we'll type hello and then hello
05:46 - YouTube if we click show message you can
05:49 - see the title is set to hello and it sh
05:52 - shows hello YouTube now if we take out
05:55 - hello and leave it as nothing you can
05:57 - see that when we click show message it's
05:59 - it says default title right
06:02 - there so let's go ahead and close out of
06:04 - that so um go ahead and make some subs
06:08 - or functions if you'd like and play
06:10 - around with optional buy vals
06:13 - or use you can use optional buy vals
06:17 - with bu vales and with byrs go ahead mix
06:19 - and match those get a lot of practice
06:21 - with that and then once you're done with
06:23 - that go ahead and move on to the next
06:25 - tutorial and thanks for watching guys
