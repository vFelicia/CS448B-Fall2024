00:00 - what is going on ladies and gentlemen
00:01 - welcome back and in this video I'm gonna
00:04 - start talking to you guys about Google's
00:05 - webmaster guidelines now Google's
00:09 - webmaster guidelines are essentially
00:10 - just guidelines made by Google obviously
00:12 - for making a quality website and they
00:16 - have a couple different guidelines and
00:18 - I'm going to talk to you guys about all
00:19 - the different ones but for right now I
00:21 - just want to show you guys this real
00:22 - cool tool I found online and this is VA
00:26 - rvy com VAR v com I guess that's how you
00:30 - pronounce it and what you can do is you
00:32 - can actually just paste in the URL of
00:35 - your website and test it and what this
00:38 - is going to do is it's going to look at
00:40 - your website and it's going to go
00:42 - through and test for every single
00:44 - guideline so this one's good this one's
00:47 - good whenever you see a X it's basically
00:49 - saying hey this website doesn't follow
00:52 - this guideline so my website right now
00:54 - it doesn't have a sitemap and we'll talk
00:56 - a little bit about what that is but
00:58 - essentially it's a really useful tool
01:00 - and it's free so that's pretty cool so
01:03 - as we can see there's a bunch of
01:05 - different guidelines robots.txt on a
01:08 - sitemap make sure you have alt tags in
01:11 - your images yada yada so let's go ahead
01:13 - and break it down and we'll just start
01:15 - with the very first one for this video
01:16 - which is robots dot text so basically
01:21 - any time you make a website you should
01:24 - have a robots I say robots robots dot
01:27 - txt file now what this is is it's
01:30 - basically a plain text file and it goes
01:33 - in the root directory or right after the
01:36 - home directory of your website so
01:38 - whenever you're making one just go ahead
01:40 - and right click new file and just name
01:43 - it robots dot txt all right so what the
01:49 - heck is this this is basically a file
01:52 - that essentially instructs bots on what
01:56 - they're allowed to crawl and what
01:58 - they're not allowed to curl so usually
02:00 - by default what's going to happen is
02:02 - you're going to have some you know
02:04 - search engine BOTS whether it's from
02:06 - being Yahoo whatever and it's just going
02:08 - to start crawling your website every
02:10 - single page that it can possibly find
02:12 - however
02:13 - chances are that you have some resources
02:16 - or webpages that you don't want it to
02:18 - curl for example like the admin page or
02:21 - maybe the moderator panel or maybe just
02:24 - some I don't know like nude pictures
02:26 - that you have online by K this is
02:28 - actually for me so can you leave these
02:30 - out of your search results so basically
02:33 - the way it works is is really simple you
02:35 - only need to remember two things the
02:37 - first is user agent so what you can do
02:40 - is you can write star and that means
02:42 - that these rules that I'm going to tell
02:45 - you they apply to all search engine BOTS
02:48 - however you can also do something like
02:51 - this say that you only want to do make
02:54 - some rules for like Google's search
02:56 - engine BOTS well the name for that is
02:58 - Googlebot so you can do that but the
03:01 - majority of the time you just say user
03:03 - agent star so this means I'm making
03:06 - these rules for all search engine
03:09 - crawlers or BOTS whatever you want to
03:11 - call them now after this line let me
03:13 - pull this up again you essentially have
03:16 - a bunch of these disallowed this allowed
03:18 - disallow now disallow basically says all
03:23 - right you're allowed to crawl every
03:25 - single web page except the ones I'm
03:27 - telling you now if you just wanted to
03:30 - have the search engine mods ignore an
03:33 - entire directory or folder what you can
03:36 - do is write it like this so whenever you
03:41 - write this this means hey don't look at
03:44 - anything in my private directory those
03:46 - are like my personal things I don't want
03:48 - them indexed on your search engine now
03:51 - if you only want to say hey can you
03:55 - ignore one specific page you can do
03:58 - something like this
03:59 - private new pics the HTML or you can say
04:03 - like a admin the HTML and if you have
04:08 - multiple rules say we wanted to disallow
04:12 - admin and the entire private directory
04:15 - and I don't know like a personal
04:20 - password text then this would say hey
04:24 - whenever you're on my site leave these
04:27 - out so again it's just basically
04:30 - instructions on what the search engine
04:32 - but is not allowed to crawl now one
04:34 - other thing and this is actually a
04:36 - really important thing that I want to
04:37 - point out is that keep note that this
04:40 - file is actually used a lot by hackers
04:43 - and malicious people why is that
04:46 - well basically whenever someone goes
04:48 - your site they say hmm I wonder if they
04:50 - got any you know sensitive areas any you
04:54 - know web pages on here that they really
04:56 - don't want the public to know about well
04:58 - what they do is they just look for a
05:00 - robots.txt file and again the majority
05:02 - of the time this is just going to be
05:03 - used by search engines but it's actually
05:05 - readable by anyone so if they see a file
05:09 - or you know some directory in here like
05:11 - passwords or database or you know
05:15 - personal stuff then they're pretty much
05:17 - just going to go to it so again make
05:19 - sure that you never upload any sensitive
05:21 - information and also just be aware that
05:25 - hackers may look for these pages and
05:28 - these are pretty much um I know for a
05:31 - lot of people who don't know this it's
05:34 - basically like giving hackers the
05:36 - blueprint to what to attack on your
05:39 - website so holy moly
05:42 - Hot Tamale so there you go robots that
05:44 - text and since we have a little bit of
05:46 - time I'll show you guys this
05:48 - I created a patreon account I think
05:51 - that's how you pronounce it so this is
05:54 - basically for donations if you guys feel
05:57 - like donating my goal is for the end of
06:00 - the week I want to raise $25 and by the
06:02 - end of next week I want to raise 7
06:04 - billion dollars so yeah we'll see how
06:06 - that goes and also a cool little thing I
06:09 - did this interview for a website called
06:12 - human fox and they basically just asked
06:15 - me you know how I got started
06:16 - programming um asked me about like
06:19 - education and what my dreams my passions
06:23 - are and you know some pretty cool stuff
06:25 - so if you guys want to check that out
06:27 - feel free human fox comm slash capsule
06:31 - slash
06:31 - bucky so there you go we learned a
06:34 - little bit about robots.txt files and in
06:37 - the next videos we're going to be
06:38 - covering the rest of these guidelines
06:40 - it's going to be shweet so i'll see you
06:42 - guys next time
