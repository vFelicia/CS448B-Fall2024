00:00 - what is going on guys it's Bucky and
00:02 - welcome to your 29th CSS tutorial and
00:05 - this tutorial is going to be amazing
00:07 - because we're going to be talking about
00:09 - my favorite part of CSS and that is
00:12 - called the div element now before you
00:15 - might have noticed if you try to make a
00:16 - cool-looking webpage that what we know
00:19 - so far we can't really get a cool layout
00:23 - with our web page maybe you tried using
00:25 - tables but that didn't really work out
00:27 - it looked like an old web page I mean if
00:29 - we just put like a heading and an image
00:32 - and then a paragraph everything kind of
00:34 - looks like it's stacked on top of each
00:36 - other and it reminds you of like the old
00:38 - 1990s websites where everything was just
00:40 - like plain and stupid and it wasn't a
00:43 - good layout look more of like a outline
00:45 - for English class than the layout so
00:47 - here is what I'm going to introduce to
00:50 - you guys in this tutorial an element
00:52 - called div short for division long for
00:56 - the now it's not long for dubba anyways
00:59 - what it means is a div element pretty
01:03 - much gives you the ability to define
01:07 - sections on your web page to place
01:09 - elements exactly where you want them so
01:12 - for example if you want an image in the
01:14 - top right and then um maybe a heading in
01:17 - the bottom left and maybe some
01:19 - paragraphs somewhere in the middle you
01:21 - can position them exactly how you want
01:24 - them using the div element so now
01:26 - everything just doesn't have to go
01:28 - paragraph under a heading under an image
01:31 - under another heading nothing has to be
01:34 - stacked on top of each other anymore it
01:36 - could be laid out to the left right side
01:38 - by side if you want so anyways enough of
01:41 - me talking let's get and let me show you
01:43 - guys this div in action so let's go
01:46 - ahead and put some text on the screen
01:48 - just put some my name is Bucky that's
01:52 - good enough nothing too big I don't want
01:54 - to waste my time type in a worthless
01:56 - text so anyways go ahead and surround it
01:59 - with these tags div and yes you have to
02:03 - use those exact letters and div so now
02:07 - the text my name is Bucky it's
02:10 - surrounded in
02:11 - tags right here so what exactly can we
02:14 - do with div tags well if we go up here
02:17 - in our CSS interactive and in our
02:20 - properties or curly braces whatever you
02:22 - want to come go ahead and start adding
02:24 - properties to it first of all let's go
02:27 - ahead and make it easy to see so let's
02:28 - give it a like a solid red border so
02:31 - border two pixels solid red if you guys
02:35 - can't see that then you are blind so now
02:38 - I'm going to teach guys about something
02:40 - called positioning but actually just go
02:43 - ahead and do this position app salute
02:48 - now positioning is like a whole another
02:51 - tutorial so I'm just going to skip over
02:53 - this for now but it's crucial that if
02:56 - you want to follow along then your right
02:58 - position equals absolute but again arm
03:00 - don't worry about position right now
03:03 - because I'm going to be covering that in
03:04 - like two or three tutorials but for now
03:06 - let's just stick with div and focus on
03:08 - this so anyways like I said a div is
03:11 - pretty much a section of your website so
03:13 - what we can do to give this box yeah
03:16 - that's a better term for a box when what
03:19 - we can do is first give this box a width
03:22 - so go ahead and set the width equal to
03:25 - 300 pixels and now what we can do is
03:30 - check it out let's go ahead and save it
03:32 - so we see what we're working with first
03:33 - go ahead and refresh the screen and we
03:36 - now have a box on our screen now the
03:39 - text is inside the box aka the div and
03:43 - also the box has a border of two pixels
03:45 - it's solid and it's red person all right
03:48 - Bucky you told me that I can position
03:50 - this anywhere I want on the screen it
03:53 - doesn't have to be stuck in the top-left
03:54 - corner well let's go ahead and change
03:56 - that right now in order to change the
03:59 - position of this box the only thing you
04:02 - need our coordinates now here is the top
04:06 - of your browser right here and here's
04:07 - the left-hand side so say you want to
04:10 - move it down 40 pixels so be somewhere
04:12 - right here and left 35 pixels so it'll
04:15 - be like the top left will be somewhere
04:17 - right here so let's go ahead and do that
04:19 - by adding the properties top
04:22 - and go ahead and make this forty pixels
04:25 - and also set left equal to 35 pixels and
04:30 - a lot of people get this confused easy
04:33 - whenever you save it and refresh it you
04:35 - see that it moved down 40 pixels and it
04:38 - moved to the right 40 pixels whenever
04:40 - you say top 40 pixels you're saying the
04:43 - top left corner you want to be 40 pixels
04:47 - down right here not like the middle some
04:51 - people might think all right a middle
04:53 - point would be a good point to move
04:54 - around but it's actually the top-left
04:56 - corner you're you're focusing on so
04:59 - whenever you say top 40 it says move the
05:02 - top down 40 or in other words 40 pixels
05:06 - from the top and whenever you say left
05:08 - the 35 pixels it says move this corner
05:11 - 35 pixels from the left so now we have
05:14 - our box move down from the top 40 pixels
05:17 - and move down org ship excuse me moved
05:20 - over from the left 35 pixels so pretty
05:25 - easy to understand and now you can see
05:27 - by using those coordinates we can move
05:29 - this box around the screen any where we
05:32 - want so this is a lot better way of
05:35 - positioning our elements around on the
05:37 - screen then just before or maybe if you
05:39 - tried using a table don't ever do that
05:42 - because it just doesn't work this is the
05:44 - new and improved way of how to use CSS
05:46 - to position elements so later on when
05:49 - we're making an entire website and say
05:51 - maybe we want our logo in the top left
05:53 - and maybe an ad on the top right and a
05:56 - navigation bar across the top and maybe
05:58 - some more navigation on the Left we use
06:01 - a bunch of different divs in order to
06:04 - make a bunch of different boxes that we
06:06 - can put stuff in so anyways I'm going to
06:10 - be teaching you guys about positioning
06:11 - and how to make different types of divs
06:14 - in upcoming tutorials so don't forget to
06:16 - check those out so for now thank you
06:18 - guys for watching don't forget to
