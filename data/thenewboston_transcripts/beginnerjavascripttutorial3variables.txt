00:00 - what's up guys welcome to your third
00:01 - JavaScript tutorial and as promised in
00:04 - this tutorial I want to talk to you guys
00:06 - about a huge concept in JavaScript
00:09 - probably the most important concept that
00:11 - you guys need to learn and that is the
00:12 - use of variables so go ahead and try to
00:16 - remember all the way back to like fifth
00:18 - grade algebra class until you first
00:20 - learn about variables now if you can't
00:23 - remember here's a little refresher in
00:25 - order to use variable or what variable
00:28 - basically is is you take something like
00:30 - the letter X and you set it equal to
00:32 - something else like the word ham and
00:35 - then when your math teacher wrote
00:37 - something like I love X or X comes from
00:42 - a pig you understood that this meant I
00:45 - love ham and ham comes from a pig that
00:48 - is because X and ham are basically the
00:51 - same thing so that is pretty much what a
00:54 - variable is it's just a fancy word for a
00:57 - placeholder a variable is a placeholder
01:00 - holds the place of something else and
01:03 - let me go ahead and delete that first of
01:05 - all so in JavaScript we use variables a
01:09 - whole bunch and we use them kind of in
01:12 - the same way but a little bit different
01:14 - now in order to tell JavaScript that
01:17 - we're going to be working with a
01:18 - variable we need to write the keyword
01:20 - var this tells JavaScript all right
01:23 - you're ready for this we are about to
01:25 - make a variable you need to include that
01:27 - the next thing that you're right is the
01:30 - name of your variable I'm just going to
01:31 - go ahead and name my variable X but you
01:34 - know you can name it whatever you want
01:35 - so after this you go ahead and write the
01:39 - equal sign now the equal sign is called
01:41 - the assignment operator technically like
01:44 - if you're learning this because you have
01:46 - a JavaScript class and you're trying to
01:47 - refresh on JavaScript and he says all
01:49 - right what's the equal sign called in
01:51 - JavaScript you need to say it's the
01:53 - assignment operator but other than that
01:56 - in these tutorials I'm just going to say
01:57 - equal sign because you know it's a whole
01:59 - lot easier
02:00 - but anyways you write var the name of
02:03 - your variables the assignment operator
02:05 - or equal sign and then you write what
02:08 - you want your variable to equal so go
02:10 - ahead and just write like 23 or
02:12 - something
02:13 - any value in there and then of course
02:15 - like every single statement in
02:18 - JavaScript we have to end it with a
02:20 - semicolon
02:21 - so you're saying RA Y is a variable
02:24 - useful what can I do with variables well
02:27 - a variable is useful for many reasons I
02:29 - mean already we know how to print
02:32 - something out on the screen so go ahead
02:33 - and write document dot right and then
02:37 - inside your parentheses instead of
02:40 - putting quotation marks in the line of
02:42 - text that it will print out go ahead and
02:44 - delete everything and just go ahead and
02:46 - write your variable and check this out
02:48 - go ahead and save this and refresh it
02:51 - and see what we get 23 just like that
02:54 - so as you can see that it pretty much
02:58 - this is what Java Script is
03:00 - understanding all right you're making a
03:02 - variable called X and you're setting it
03:05 - equal to 23 so now whenever I come
03:07 - across the term X in my program I note
03:10 - that to substitute it for 23 so if
03:13 - you're saying alright Bucky you probably
03:15 - could just wrote 23 in here and it would
03:17 - have printed out just fine so why go
03:19 - through the trouble of writing X well
03:21 - when you're building computer programs
03:23 - you don't just have it occur one time
03:26 - you might have a thousand different
03:28 - lines of code that include the term X so
03:31 - you can either type out the word or
03:34 - excuse me the number 23 each time or you
03:37 - can just go ahead up here change it one
03:39 - time and automatically going to change
03:41 - in all of your code for you so anyways
03:44 - it's going to save you a bunch of time
03:45 - and it's also useful for different
03:48 - reasons that I don't want to talk about
03:49 - right now or it'll just confuse you but
03:51 - anyways that is what variable is how to
03:54 - make it and how it's useful another
03:57 - thing I want to mention is go ahead and
03:59 - delete this is I said you can name your
04:02 - variable anything you want but I kind of
04:04 - lied just a little bit the first thing I
04:06 - want to mention is this variables are
04:09 - case sensitive and I mean that in if we
04:12 - go ahead and try to type a capital X up
04:14 - here and refresh it and see what happens
04:16 - we get nothing on our screen that's
04:18 - because a lowercase X is different than
04:21 - uppercase X the variable name Buckey or
04:24 - excuse me let me
04:25 - thick the variable name Bucky is
04:28 - different than this be you see KY
04:31 - even though they're spelled the same if
04:33 - we try to run it you're going to get
04:34 - nothing again because it looks at it as
04:37 - two different variables so make sure
04:39 - that if a variable might be messing up
04:41 - that and that means that you might have
04:43 - capitalized something that you shouldn't
04:45 - capitalize another thing I want to
04:47 - mention is you just can't you know use
04:51 - any symbols and letters you want you
04:53 - need to start your variable name with a
04:56 - letter or an underscore
04:57 - so since Bucky starts with the letter
04:59 - you can also start it with the
05:01 - underscore that would be valid but you
05:03 - can't start it with like and/or
05:05 - percentage sign or anything like that it
05:08 - needs to start with the underscore or a
05:10 - letter another thing is that the other
05:14 - characters in your variable name must be
05:16 - letters numbers or underscores for
05:19 - example you can't have like armed Bucky
05:23 - percent dollar sign dollar sign to at
05:25 - sign that's that variable doesn't make
05:28 - sense at all basically just use letters
05:30 - numbers and underscores and you'll be
05:33 - fine
05:33 - and lastly I want to talk to you guys is
05:36 - that the most difficult thing to
05:39 - remember is that your variables can't
05:42 - start with numbers for example if you
05:44 - have variable six Bucky equals
05:47 - thirty-two and you try to run this
05:49 - program it's not going to work out
05:51 - because your variables can't start with
05:54 - numbers that's probably probably the
05:56 - most forgotten rule but I needed to tell
05:58 - you guys so whenever I said that you can
06:01 - name your variable anything you want I
06:03 - kind of lied you just have to remember
06:04 - these simple rules it has to begin with
06:06 - a letter or an underscore and only use
06:10 - letters numbers and underscores you
06:13 - can't use dollar sign spaces percent
06:16 - signs at signs you can't use any of
06:18 - those and if you follow those simple
06:20 - rules you'll be good to go so now that
06:22 - we understand what a basic variable is
06:26 - and how it's useful in computer
06:28 - programming we can go on and move to our
06:30 - next tutorial and in the next tutorial
06:32 - I'm going to be teaching you guys about
06:33 - the different types of variables and
06:35 - trust me it's
06:37 - be extremely useful so anyways thank you
06:39 - guys for watching don't forget to
06:40 - subscribe and I'll see in the next video
