00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:04 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to be creating
00:08 - the web favorites um tray
00:12 - application
00:13 - so let's see here we'll set the
00:16 - favorites viewer
00:18 - YouTube as our startup project so set a
00:22 - startup
00:23 - project and if we go ahead and run this
00:25 - you can see that it opens up this window
00:28 - right here now if somebody already has
00:30 - their favorites in their bar their
00:32 - internet browser why wouldn't they just
00:34 - open their internet browser and go to
00:36 - that instead of opening a whole another
00:38 - application to go to it so what we're
00:41 - going to be making is a program that
00:43 - runs in the tray of the taskbar and
00:46 - whenever the user right clicks on it
00:48 - they can see their favorites and
00:50 - automatically open one of those whenever
00:52 - they click on it so we go ahead and
00:54 - close out of this and we'll come over
00:56 - here to our solution and we'll click
00:59 - file
01:00 - add new
01:02 - project so we will just shrink this down
01:06 - some we'll select a Windows forms
01:09 - application and we'll call it favorites
01:13 - favorites viewer tray and then we'll go
01:16 - ahead and click
01:21 - okay and it looks like I selected a
01:24 - class
01:25 - Library so let's remove this
01:34 - and we need to do
01:36 - file add new
01:40 - project Windows forms
01:43 - application and
01:46 - favorites viewer tray and then we'll go
01:50 - ahead and click
01:53 - okay and I'll just call it favorites
01:55 - viewer tray YouTube because that project
01:57 - already exists Okay so so here's our
02:00 - form one right here now let's come come
02:02 - over to the properties and we want it to
02:06 - um not show the form so we'll set the
02:08 - windows state to minimize and we will
02:12 - find the property show in taskbar and
02:16 - we'll set that to
02:19 - false okay so now whenever the form
02:22 - opens it's going to be minimized and
02:24 - it's not going to be shown in the
02:25 - taskbar so what this does is it keeps
02:28 - the user from opening this form because
02:31 - there's nothing on it uh for them to
02:33 - use so we'll come over here and let's
02:36 - add a notify
02:38 - icon go ahead and get out of the
02:44 - toolbox okay so we'll set this the name
02:47 - of this notify icon to let's just
02:51 - do icon
02:54 - notify favorites go ahead and press
02:57 - enter so now we need to select form one
03:01 - and let's come over here to the events
03:03 - and we'll just add one more thing that
03:05 - will keep them from being able to see
03:07 - the form so we need to find the visible
03:10 - changed
03:11 - event so here is visible
03:14 - changed
03:16 - so we'll just use a simple if statement
03:19 - here so if
03:21 - me. visible so it gives the seter value
03:24 - indicating where the the control and all
03:27 - it child controls are displayed so if
03:30 - form one is visible oh well if me do
03:33 - visible equals
03:35 - true then me. visible equals false so
03:41 - what this is going to do is it's going
03:43 - to if form one is visible and all of the
03:46 - controls on it are visible um then it's
03:49 - going to set it to where it isn't
03:52 - visible now when you to go ahead and
03:54 - come over here and set an icon for our
03:57 - notify
03:58 - icon let's see
04:02 - here looks like it didn't save the name
04:05 - so we'll just call it
04:07 - icon
04:09 - notify and we will set the icon to the
04:12 - favorites icon that we have used before
04:15 - so we'll just go ahead and open
04:18 - that so now what we can do is we
04:24 - can set the text to Ah that's what I
04:27 - changed I changed the text and not the
04:29 - name so we'll set the text
04:33 - to
04:34 - rightclick for
04:38 - favorites so let's go ahead and run
04:43 - this and we need to set our startup
04:46 - project to the favorites viewer
04:52 - YouTube so let me fix this real quick or
04:57 - favorites viewer Trey YouTube so we'll
04:59 - set this as the startup
05:01 - project and if we go ahead and run this
05:04 - you can see that nothing shows up but if
05:07 - we come down here and look in our tray
05:10 - uh this is actually my timer for these
05:11 - tutorials to see how long it's been uh
05:13 - taking me but we come down here to our
05:16 - tray you can see that here is our um
05:19 - icon with the star and it says
05:21 - rightclick for
05:23 - favorites but if we right click nothing
05:25 - shows up so what we're going to be doing
05:27 - in the next tutorial is learning how to
05:31 - make it show a menu whenever they right
05:33 - click it so they can view their
05:34 - favorites
