00:00 - what is up guys welcome to your sixth
00:02 - JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial
00:05 - I'm going to be talking to you guys
00:06 - about something called functions now a
00:08 - function is basically a mini program
00:11 - it's a mini program that you can use
00:13 - anytime you want throughout your
00:15 - javascripting for example if you're
00:17 - making YouTube they probably have a
00:20 - function to play the video whenever you
00:22 - hit the play button they have a function
00:24 - to pause the video whenever you hit the
00:26 - pause button they have a function a
00:28 - function to add add a vote to the thumbs
00:31 - up whenever you click the thumbs up
00:32 - button so as you can see a function can
00:36 - be called not only as soon as the web
00:39 - page loads but it can be called anytime
00:41 - you want so let's go ahead and make a
00:43 - function right now in order to make a
00:46 - function you first type the name oh
00:49 - let's give us some space type the name
00:52 - function this tells JavaScript all right
00:55 - we're about to make a function now after
00:57 - this you give a name to your function
00:59 - I'm going to name mine funky because
01:01 - this function is funky now after this
01:04 - you add two little parentheses I'm not
01:08 - going to be talking about these yet but
01:09 - these are called your parameters so
01:12 - we'll just ignore these for now until
01:13 - the next tutorial and then after these
01:15 - you add two little curly braces now
01:18 - inside the curly braces is where you're
01:20 - going to be putting all of your
01:22 - JavaScript code all of the code you put
01:24 - in here all the statements is the code
01:27 - that it's going to run whenever you want
01:29 - to use your function
01:30 - so if you're making that YouTube page
01:33 - whenever they clicked the play button
01:35 - you would play the video now so anyways
01:39 - you can see that this is the code that
01:41 - we want to happen whenever they call
01:43 - that function AKA whenever the user
01:46 - wants to use that function so let's go
01:49 - ahead and in our function we'll make it
01:50 - do something really simple let's go
01:52 - ahead and make a popup appear on our
01:54 - screen so making popups is really easy
01:57 - in JavaScript all you need to do is
01:59 - write the name alert and this means make
02:02 - popup on the screen now inside the
02:04 - parentheses for this you write what you
02:06 - want to appear in the box so just go
02:09 - ahead and write like ouch or something
02:11 - like that now whenever this function is
02:13 - used a popup is going to appear on our
02:16 - screen and it's going to say ouch so
02:19 - let's go ahead and well let's go ahead
02:22 - and use the function right now so in
02:24 - order to use a function you go ahead and
02:27 - write the name of your function
02:30 - funky and then you go ahead and write
02:32 - those parentheses which we don't know
02:34 - what they do yet but we'll be learning
02:35 - that in the next tutorial and then since
02:37 - this is a statement we go ahead and end
02:39 - it with a semicolon so anyways our our
02:43 - JavaScript is going to say all right we
02:45 - have a function right here prepare to
02:47 - use it whenever we call it so right here
02:50 - is when we call it and by the way like I
02:52 - said anytime I say call a function I
02:54 - mean use a function calling a function
02:56 - is just a technical term so use my
02:59 - function so is going to say all right
03:00 - call funky now so a popup is going to
03:03 - appear so let's go ahead and save this
03:04 - and see this baby in
03:06 - action as soon as we load our page it's
03:09 - going to call it bam look at that a
03:11 - popup appear here and it said ouch so
03:14 - let's go ahead and um maybe it will be
03:16 - easier to see if I actually add a button
03:19 - on the screen so you guys can see
03:20 - functions don't need to happen as soon
03:22 - as you load your page but whenever you
03:24 - need to call them so let's go ahead
03:26 - instead of just calling it right or
03:27 - right right away like right then let's
03:30 - go ahead and add a form on our page
03:32 - because if we add a
03:34 - form we can go ahead and add buttons so
03:38 - actually we need to do that outside the
03:40 - JavaScript since it isn't actually part
03:42 - of JavaScript it's actually part of
03:44 - xhtml so go ahead and add a
03:47 - form and end your form right here and
03:51 - inside your form you're only going to
03:52 - have one element the input and by the
03:54 - way if you have no idea what I'm doing
03:56 - right now go ahead and watch my xhtml
03:58 - tutorials I talk all about forms and
04:00 - stuff like that so the input the type of
04:03 - this is button it's just going to appear
04:05 - as a button on your screen the value is
04:08 - what you want to say on the button and
04:09 - it we'll just write touch
04:11 - me and there is another parameter that
04:15 - you can add to your buttons and that's
04:17 - onclick and inside or the value for
04:20 - onclick you go ahead and you write the
04:22 - name of your JavaScript function and I'm
04:25 - just going to go ahead and write funky
04:27 - because that's the name of the function
04:29 - so so anyways check this out if we go
04:31 - ahead and save this and launch it in
04:33 - Chrome we go ahead and we have a button
04:36 - on the screen that says touch me that's
04:38 - by default what's loaded on our web page
04:41 - but you can see we added a attribute to
04:43 - this function or excuse me this button
04:45 - called onclick funky that means whenever
04:49 - we click this button we want you to use
04:51 - a JavaScript function called funky so
04:54 - whenever we click this button an alert
04:56 - box is going to pop up that says ouch so
04:59 - let's go ahead and click this button and
05:02 - we see the alert box pops up and it says
05:04 - ouch press okay and that's it so that is
05:08 - the beauty of you know not only how to
05:11 - make buttons but also how you can call a
05:13 - section of JavaScript by using something
05:16 - called functions so anyways by default
05:19 - your web page loaded and it loaded this
05:21 - form with a button on it by default it
05:24 - did nothing but whenever we clicked it
05:27 - it said all right whenever you click me
05:29 - I'm going to call this function called
05:31 - funky so that means I'm going to go back
05:33 - up here and do whatever you told me to
05:35 - do inside so by the way the line of code
05:39 - inside your curly bracket is called the
05:41 - Declaration some people call it the body
05:43 - but I just call it whatever codes inside
05:45 - your curly bracket and that is the
05:48 - basics of how to create a function just
05:50 - go ahead and write the name function the
05:52 - name parentheses curly brackets and
05:55 - write your rules inside your function
05:58 - and also how to call a function fun
05:59 - whenever you want using a button or you
06:02 - can just call it automatically by
06:04 - writing the name of the function but
06:06 - anyways in the next tutorial I'm going
06:08 - to show you guys what these parentheses
06:10 - are and why they are useful and why most
06:13 - functions actually use those parentheses
06:16 - so anyways thank you guys for watching
06:17 - this tutorial thank you for learning the
06:19 - basics of a function if you don't quite
06:21 - understand just stick with me in the
06:23 - next tutorial everything will clear up
06:24 - for you so anyways thank you guys for
06:26 - watching don't forget to subscribe and
06:27 - I'll see you guys next video
