00:01 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:04 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:06 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:08 - taking a look at quitting your do loops
00:10 - early now this will work for do-while
00:14 - loops or do one two loops now if you
00:16 - remember back we learned how to quit for
00:19 - loops early now the same concept can be
00:23 - applied to do until and do-while loops
00:25 - let's go ahead and get started and make
00:28 - a little demo application so go ahead
00:31 - and select console application and we'll
00:34 - type this quitting do loops go ahead and
00:40 - click okay so let's zoom in some here
00:45 - and let's go ahead and add console dot
00:49 - read line okay so now let's create our
00:56 - do until loop so let's do until num1
01:02 - equals 10 then go ahead and loop now
01:07 - let's come up here and create num 1 so
01:13 - we'll declare num1 as integer and we
01:16 - will set it equal to zero so now it's
01:21 - equal to zero we're going to do until
01:23 - num1 equals 10 and we will console dot
01:26 - write line num1 so now what we're going
01:32 - to do is we are going to increment num1
01:38 - so if you run this it's going to give us
01:43 - 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 now let's add a
01:48 - simple if statement so
01:54 - if num1 equals 5 then exit do so what
02:06 - this is going to do is whenever it comes
02:09 - down after they are due until statement
02:12 - each time it loops it's going to hit
02:14 - this if statement right here and then if
02:16 - number one is equal to five then exit
02:18 - the do loop
02:19 - so since num1 starts at zero it's going
02:22 - to run through this it's going to be
02:23 - fine and it's going to equal to one and
02:25 - then it's going to go down and then once
02:27 - it equals five it's going to exit the do
02:29 - so our program is going to print out 0 1
02:32 - 2 3 4 because it's going to exit once to
02:35 - equals 5 let's go ahead and run this and
02:38 - you can see here that we have 0 1 2 3 4
02:44 - now we can also do this with a do-while
02:47 - loop so do while num 1 is less than or
02:53 - equal to 10 so if num 1 is equal to 5
02:58 - then exit the new loop let's go ahead
03:02 - and change this a little bit here will
03:04 - do if num 1 is equal to 7 so you can see
03:08 - here that we get 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 and then
03:12 - it exits now what we can also do is
03:17 - let's say our do-while loop is not
03:20 - incrementing by 1 so what if it skips
03:23 - the number 5 well what we can do instead
03:26 - of if num 1 equals 5 we can do if num 1
03:30 - is greater than 5 so let's just
03:32 - increment this by 2 and you can see here
03:35 - that we're going to get 0 to 4 and now
03:40 - you can see that it stops before it got
03:42 - to 5 because num 1 was greater than 5
03:44 - now if we do it like this then it's
03:46 - going to print out all the way and this
03:48 - if statement is never going to run so go
03:53 - ahead and make a couple do until loops
03:55 - that exit based on certain conditions
03:58 - you can do it differently than I did it
04:00 - I encourage you to do that
04:01 - so you can learn more
04:03 - about the programming and then once you
04:05 - got that down go ahead and move on to
04:07 - the next tutorial and thanks for
04:09 - watching
