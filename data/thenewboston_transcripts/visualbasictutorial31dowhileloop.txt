00:01 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:04 - slash on live gamer for the New Boston
00:06 - in this tutorial we're going to be
00:08 - taking a look at the do-while loop so
00:11 - basically what the do-while loop is is
00:13 - it sounds very similar to the do until
00:16 - loop but the concept of it is completely
00:20 - opposite now what I mean by this is that
00:22 - the do one two loop will perform a set
00:27 - of code until a value or until something
00:31 - is true
00:31 - now the do-while loop is completely
00:34 - opposite it will perform a block of code
00:38 - while a value is true and then once that
00:41 - value is false it's going to stop so
00:44 - let's go ahead and make a couple demos
00:46 - of this so go ahead and make a new
00:48 - project we will call it do-while loop
00:56 - make sure you've selected console
00:58 - application and go ahead and click okay
01:04 - so we'll just give that a second to load
01:06 - here now let's zoom in a bit let's go
01:14 - ahead and add console dot readline so I
01:17 - don't forget this when we try to run our
01:19 - program and now let's come up right
01:21 - above that and we're going to create a
01:22 - variable so we'll use the dim keyword
01:26 - we'll just call it num1 as integer and
01:30 - we'll set it equal to zero now let's go
01:34 - ahead and make our do-while loop so
01:37 - we're going to start off by using the do
01:38 - keyword which the description says
01:41 - repeats a block of statements until a
01:43 - baloon boolean condition is true so now
01:47 - we're going to add wild so repeats a
01:49 - block of statements while a balloon
01:51 - booth lean condition is true so do while
01:55 - num 1 is less than or equal to 15 now
02:00 - you can see that as the loop for us so
02:02 - that it'll loop back up to the do-while
02:04 - statement after every iteration of the
02:06 - loop and you can see we did less than or
02:09 - equal to 15 in this now if we just did
02:11 - less than 15 then it would
02:13 - printout until it got to 14 and then it
02:15 - would stop so we just add the equal so
02:17 - it will print all the way to 15 so we'll
02:21 - just do console dot write line num1 okay
02:29 - so now we're going to increment num1
02:31 - because we don't then it's just going to
02:33 - run forever so we'll go ahead and do
02:36 - num1 plus equals 1 so now you can see
02:40 - that if we run this we get 0 to 15
02:48 - so I finish the load here
02:54 - I don't know why it's been doing this to
02:57 - me lately but um let's go ahead and
02:59 - we'll take this statement right here
03:02 - number one plus equals one we'll cut
03:06 - that out and then we'll add it before
03:08 - our print statement or our right line
03:11 - statement so basically what this is
03:13 - going to do it's going to add one two
03:14 - numbers to number one first and then
03:16 - it's going to print it out so we're
03:18 - going to start at the value one and go
03:20 - all the way to 16 now you may be
03:25 - wondering why does it go to 16 well
03:28 - because in the last one we had num1 plus
03:31 - equals 1 after our console dot write
03:33 - line so it was equal to 16 after we
03:36 - printed out 15 and then it looped up
03:39 - back to the top and said oh no it's not
03:41 - less than or equal to 15 so let's go
03:43 - ahead and quit out of this okay so if we
03:48 - do num1 plus equals 1 before then it
03:51 - will go to 16 and then it'll come back
03:54 - up and say oh it's not less than equal
03:55 - to 15 let's go ahead and exit out of
03:58 - here so that was a quick tutorial on how
04:03 - to do do-while loops go ahead and
04:06 - practice some do-while loops some do
04:07 - until loops from the tutorial before
04:09 - this - once you got those down go ahead
04:12 - and move on to the next tutorial and
04:13 - thanks for watching
