00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:04 - in this video we're gonna be creating a
00:07 - plugin we're going to be creating a
00:09 - plugin which counts down a particular
00:11 - amount of days hours minutes and seconds
00:14 - to a specified date so inside of our
00:17 - plugin we're going to be giving the
00:18 - option which is a string a date string
00:22 - which will then be converted to a
00:24 - timestamp and we'll perform some
00:26 - calculations based on this timestamp
00:29 - we'll find out the difference between
00:30 - the date now and the date that we want
00:33 - to count down to and then we'll update
00:35 - these divs here now I'm gonna go through
00:38 - first of all the way that the plug-in
00:39 - works then we're going to open up my
00:41 - browser and have a look at how this
00:43 - actually looks and then obviously in the
00:46 - second part of the tutorial when we
00:47 - actually have demonstrated this we'll go
00:50 - ahead and write the code so the first
00:53 - thing you'll notice that is that I have
00:54 - a div called countdown this can be
00:57 - called absolutely anything and can
00:59 - actually be you know any element at all
01:01 - as long as we obviously reference this
01:05 - when we use the plug-in make use of the
01:07 - plug-in I've also got for span tags here
01:12 - with different classes which are days
01:14 - hours minutes and seconds and as long as
01:18 - the class of any particular element this
01:21 - could be these could even be divs inside
01:22 - here as long as they're called days
01:25 - hours minutes and seconds then we can
01:29 - use the plug-in and apply the plug-in to
01:31 - this countdown div which will update
01:33 - days hours minutes and seconds now by
01:36 - default I've got these set to double
01:37 - zero so if you were to just create this
01:40 - on a page you would have 0 0 days 0 0
01:45 - hours 0 0 minutes and 0 0 seconds so
01:49 - let's just take a look at what I've
01:50 - included on my page
01:52 - I've got obviously jQuery here jQuery J
01:56 - is the latest version of jQuery
01:57 - I've got countdown jQuery j/s which is
02:01 - this file here which is my account now
02:02 - and plug in and I've got ext J S which
02:05 - is where we call the plug-in from so
02:08 - inside the xtj s you see that we've got
02:10 - document ready and then we apply this
02:12 - cow
02:13 - down plug into this countdown div that
02:15 - we're currently selecting we specify a
02:18 - date and then we have a callback
02:19 - function here that runs this line of
02:22 - code when the countdown has finished ie
02:25 - when it's you know started at a
02:28 - particular day this here for example and
02:31 - then reaches you know zero or reaches
02:34 - the current time and date specified here
02:37 - then we just change this div to we're
02:40 - live so in my browser at the moment I'm
02:42 - going to just show you we've got this
02:44 - set as 10th to 10th of August 2011 at
02:46 - 1044 inside my browser you can see that
02:50 - we've got one day 19 hours 13 minutes
02:52 - and 24 seconds and you can actually see
02:55 - that this value is decrementing by one
02:58 - every second obviously we're counting
03:00 - down seconds and just as you notice it
03:03 - come to 1 then it will go to 0 obviously
03:07 - the minutes will then decrease it to 12
03:10 - minutes so this will that's all you know
03:12 - it's all bleep on so if we watch it now
03:14 - get down to 0 you can see that that's
03:17 - changed to 12 and obviously that that's
03:19 - back to 59 so we're gonna be creating
03:21 - this functionality inside of this to
03:23 - countdown plug-in and we're gonna be
03:26 - giving the option to specify a date in
03:27 - string format and then obviously using
03:30 - this callback function so at the moment
03:32 - we are on the 8th of August 2011 and the
03:37 - time is 15 31 so if I go ahead and
03:39 - change this to 15 33 for example or
03:43 - 15-year 15 33 you can see that we've got
03:47 - 1 minute and 30 seconds left so if we
03:50 - leave this to run in fact let's change
03:52 - it quickly to 32 okay so we've got 21
03:55 - seconds left now no minutes no hours and
03:58 - no days when this reaches the end this
04:00 - callback function here will be initiated
04:02 - and this line will be run so you'll see
04:05 - the effect of this so really what we use
04:08 - that we're creating this plug-in but
04:09 - then putting it into practice as well so
04:11 - let's just wait for this countdown to
04:13 - reach 0 1 0 and you see that it's
04:17 - changed to we're live so we've we've
04:20 - used the plug-in in this sense however
04:21 - when we go ahead and refresh obviously
04:23 - it just stays at where life because
04:26 - the callback function is when this date
04:28 - has reached or is you know smaller than
04:31 - or equal to the current date okay so
04:35 - let's go ahead and obviously blank all
04:39 - my pages so we can start to write this I
04:41 - obviously haven't shown inside countdown
04:43 - dot jquery.js but we'll be looking at
04:45 - that in just a moment and creating all
04:47 - that so I'll go ahead and blank
04:49 - everything and we'll start from scratch
04:52 - okay so you can see that I've got rid of
04:54 - the div here let's go ahead and create
04:57 - the div and then inside ext is I'll
05:00 - explain about how we're doing this on
05:02 - what we're doing so I'm gonna say div ID
05:04 - is equal to countdown and then that
05:07 - there and inside here I'm going to
05:09 - create some spans that have classes of
05:11 - each element of the time we're counting
05:14 - from so span there I'll just say /ban so
05:19 - this one will be days and we can go
05:22 - ahead and just copy and paste this down
05:24 - so we've got span class days then we've
05:28 - obviously got hours and then minutes
05:31 - which I'm just going to say mins and
05:32 - then seconds so I'm just going to put
05:34 - double zero in each of these and we can
05:39 - see that in our browser now we've got
05:41 - zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero
05:43 - for representation of days hours minutes
05:45 - and seconds now what's going to happen
05:48 - is jQuery is gonna find this you know if
05:51 - we if we use the plug-in on countdown it
05:53 - will find the element inside with dots
05:56 - days so class days hours minutes and
05:59 - seconds and it will change these values
06:01 - so it's important to have them inside of
06:03 - a of a span or a deer four or something
06:06 - like that a paragraph anything so I'll
06:08 - just go ahead and do this so days hours
06:10 - minutes and seconds and then that looks
06:16 - something like this so we've got not
06:18 - days not hours not minutes and not
06:19 - seconds
