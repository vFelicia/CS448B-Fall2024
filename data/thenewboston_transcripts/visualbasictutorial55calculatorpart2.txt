00:00 - hello YouTube say I'm here from
00:02 - youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
00:05 - new Boston and if you remember from the
00:07 - previous tutorial we made this
00:10 - calculator right here and now what we're
00:13 - going to do is we are going to start
00:15 - adding the code that will make our
00:16 - calculator work so go ahead and open up
00:19 - the code for it and I'll zoom in some
00:23 - here here is all of our subs that handle
00:26 - our buttons being clicked now what we're
00:29 - going to do is we're just going to come
00:30 - down below all of this and we're going
00:33 - to start off by creating the functions
00:34 - that will add subtract multiply and
00:36 - other stuff so we'll create a private
00:40 - function add and then we will buy Val
00:47 - num1 as double and then we will buy Val
00:53 - num2 as double
01:02 - so now what we're going to do is we need
01:04 - to return a value so we will just return
01:08 - num1 plus num2 now go ahead and create
01:13 - that for subtract so we'll start off
01:17 - with private functions subtract and we
01:26 - will buy Val num1 is double and num2 as
01:29 - double now we're going to do is we'll
01:36 - just return num1 - num2 now we will
01:45 - create another function for dividing so
01:49 - private function divided
01:57 - and we will add the same arguments for
02:00 - subtract and addition so we'll just copy
02:04 - this and paste it right here
02:07 - and now we're going to do is we're going
02:09 - to return num1 divided by num2 now we'll
02:15 - create this for multiply so private
02:20 - function multiplied and then we're going
02:25 - to have the same arguments as up here
02:33 - and we will just return num1 times
02:37 - num2 now we'll create that again for
02:44 - modulus but instead of using a double
02:47 - for modulus we're going to go ahead and
02:49 - use an integer because if you use a
02:52 - double for modulus you're always going
02:54 - to get the value 0 so we'll type private
02:59 - function modulus and then we'll buy val
03:10 - num1 as integer and num2 as integer and
03:21 - we will just return num1 modulus num2
03:29 - and we'll do this one more time for pi
03:32 - and so we'll go ahead and create private
03:38 - function pi and then we'll go ahead and
03:45 - add our arguments so by val num1 as
03:51 - integer and we only need one argument
03:53 - for this one let's do double instead and
03:59 - now we will just return number one times
04:04 - math dot pi now what we need to do is
04:08 - set a return type for each of these so
04:11 - for pi we'll just do as double because
04:14 - we can possibly get a double and for
04:17 - modulus we're going to have to return an
04:19 - integer and for the rest we will just
04:22 - return them as doubles
04:38 - okay so now what we'll do is we'll go
04:41 - ahead and come to our button ad click
04:46 - sub and we're going to add the two
04:48 - numbers that are in the text box so what
04:51 - we're going to do is we're going to do
04:55 - the addition so we'll type ad and then
04:59 - for our arguments we're going to go
05:00 - ahead and convert whatever text is in
05:04 - there to a double so we'll go ahead and
05:07 - type C type and then we'll just type
05:15 - text number one dot text so what this is
05:19 - going to do is it's going to convert
05:20 - text num1 dot text to a string and to
05:24 - come into an into a double and to do
05:27 - this we're going to add a comma and type
05:29 - double right there now you don't have to
05:32 - when you're using C type you don't have
05:34 - to use it in an assignment such as
05:35 - create a variable and then this variable
05:38 - equals C type you can do it on the fly
05:40 - inside arguments or wherever you want so
05:43 - we'll just do that one more time for
05:47 - text num2 dot txt and then we'll go
05:55 - ahead and close that now we need
05:57 - something to store what add gives us
05:59 - back so we'll go ahead and declare
06:02 - answer as double and we will set it
06:05 - equal to whatever add gives us back when
06:08 - we call it and give it the first number
06:11 - and the second number and let's see what
06:18 - we got here
06:23 - all right we need to convert this to a
06:25 - double okay so go ahead and try this we
06:33 - get all this code written down make sure
06:34 - you understand it you can even play
06:36 - around a bit with with it yourself to
06:39 - see if you can get it to show up in the
06:40 - third text box and to do other stuff and
06:42 - once you understand everything go ahead
06:45 - and move on to the next tutorial and
06:46 - thanks for watching
