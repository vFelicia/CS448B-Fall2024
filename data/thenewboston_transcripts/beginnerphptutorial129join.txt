00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog
00:02 - back with another video for the new
00:04 - Boston now in the last tutorial we
00:06 - looked at left join and I used left join
00:08 - for this example where we're returning a
00:10 - name with a pet arm on the end so we're
00:13 - saying here down here with the result
00:15 - was from this query we've said Alex as a
00:18 - cat Alex as a fish and out as a dog now
00:20 - what happens if we go into pets here and
00:23 - we're going to delete the entry for Dale
00:25 - so people ID - was Dale let's go ahead
00:28 - and delete that and let's run this query
00:32 - again let's paste it in there and we'll
00:35 - click go now you'll see that we've
00:37 - returned Dale add null it next to pair
00:40 - so this is useful the left join is
00:43 - useful for returning the name of the
00:45 - person because the the table we used on
00:47 - the left was the name and even if there
00:49 - are no values in pet so what we've
00:51 - essentially done here is said if there
00:53 - even if there are no entries in the
00:55 - right table which is which is pet still
00:59 - returned the name of the left hand side
01:01 - table which is named now the reason this
01:04 - is useful is because M PHP if we were to
01:06 - run this we'd need to know if the user
01:08 - had no pets at all this would save us
01:10 - using PHP num rows because we would just
01:15 - eat say if the pet equals null then
01:18 - obviously this user has no pets
01:20 - whatsoever so where we've used the left
01:23 - join for this now what happens if we
01:25 - were to use join on its own so let's go
01:29 - into SQL tab and let's go and paste this
01:33 - in here now instead of using left join
01:36 - I'm going to just use join let's go out
01:38 - click go and see how this differs now
01:40 - you'll see that we've removed the result
01:42 - Dale the reason that we've removed the
01:44 - result Dale is because we have reusing
01:48 - the join which will only return values
01:52 - that equal or that are found and based
01:55 - on this on here so we're saying if
01:59 - people ID equals pet store people ID so
02:02 - we're returning using the join only
02:05 - values that exist in each table so we're
02:08 - not saying does it only exist in the
02:09 - left table or does it only exist in the
02:11 - right table which
02:13 - does it exist in both tables so now what
02:16 - we're doing is we're only returning the
02:18 - data where the left table matches the
02:20 - right table so why could this be useful
02:22 - well we might want to inside of our PHP
02:25 - program eventually when we're executing
02:27 - this query or running this SQL query we
02:30 - might want to say we only want values
02:32 - where someone actually has a pet
02:34 - whereas before in the left join we
02:37 - looked at where Dale didn't have a pair
02:39 - we want to just say with the join only
02:42 - return results where user has a pet or
02:45 - where name has a pet the person has a
02:48 - pet so in this case we've returned two
02:50 - rows where Alex has a cat and Alex has a
02:53 - fish so now you can see the use of the
02:55 - join on its own as opposed to the left
02:57 - join where it where we're returning
03:01 - we're returning a value even if the user
03:04 - on the arm or the user doesn't have a
03:07 - value in the right hand table so this on
03:09 - is really important because what we're
03:11 - doing is we're making the comparison at
03:14 - this point so the comparison could be
03:16 - any operator but for now is people do ID
03:19 - equals pets people ID so we're matching
03:22 - from the left and the right and if we
03:24 - don't match we're not returning the
03:26 - values with the join
