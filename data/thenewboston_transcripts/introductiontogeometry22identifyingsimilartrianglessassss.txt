00:00 - our Focus today is on the two other ways
00:04 - to identify similar triangles which are
00:07 - side angle side and side side
00:13 - side so side angle side is when you have
00:16 - two pairs of corresponding sides that
00:18 - are in proportion and the included
00:21 - angles are
00:24 - congruent side side side is when you
00:26 - have three pairs of corresponding sides
00:29 - in proportion
00:32 - so now we're going to do some examples
00:35 - with these two
00:37 - properties so tell whether triangles are
00:40 - similar by side angle side or side side
00:43 - side well for this first
00:46 - one we don't know that any angles are
00:49 - congruent so it can't be side angle side
00:53 - so in order to do side side side we're
00:56 - going to put each one of the little
00:59 - triangles
01:01 - um sides over the big triangle to see if
01:04 - they're all in
01:06 - proportion so 2 over
01:09 - 8 is = to 2 over 8 and if we cross
01:18 - multiply
01:20 - um you get 16 = 16 so yes those are in
01:25 - proportion and since the other ones are
01:27 - also 2 over8
01:32 - we know that all that each one of these
01:35 - sides is in proportion with this side
01:38 - and if you want to know what the rate of
01:40 - it is it's 1/4 because
01:44 - this side is
01:47 - 1/4 of this
01:51 - side
01:54 - so for the next one we have these two
01:57 - triangles we know that this is a right
01:59 - angle this is a right angle and we have
02:02 - these two side
02:04 - lengths so since this is a right angle
02:07 - it's measure is
02:09 - 90Â° so that means that we're going to
02:11 - call this angle a and this angle D so we
02:16 - know that angle a is congruent to angle
02:20 - D so that's the a for this part so now
02:24 - we're going to put
02:26 - these we're going to put the little
02:28 - triangle over the big triangle and set
02:31 - it equal to the Little Triangle over the
02:34 - big
02:37 - triangle so then we're going to cross
02:45 - multiply and you get 72 is equal to
02:50 - 72 so there so those sides are
02:54 - proportional so therefore these
02:56 - triangles are
03:01 - similar by side angle
03:06 - side we have one more example we have
03:10 - these two triangles right here and we
03:13 - know the length of these sides so first
03:15 - we're going to check and see if these
03:16 - are proportional so we're going to put
03:20 - this side over this side and this side
03:23 - over this side so 2 over 6 is that equal
03:28 - to 2 over 6
03:30 - and yes those two sides are
03:33 - proportional so there's no property
03:36 - that's just side side but if you
03:39 - remember our special angles these angles
03:43 - right
03:44 - here are vertical angles and vertical
03:48 - angles are always congruent so we'll
03:51 - call this J and this angle K so
03:56 - since angle J
04:00 - and angle K are vertical
04:06 - angles angle J is congruent to angle K
04:11 - so now we can say that these therefore
04:14 - triangles are
04:16 - congruent excuse me not congruent
04:18 - triangles are
04:21 - similar by side angle
04:27 - side so now that we know the property
04:29 - properties of similar triangles and how
04:33 - to prove that they are similar triangles
04:35 - make sure you come and watch the next
04:37 - lesson where we're going to talk about
04:39 - perimeter and similar triangles
