00:01 - what the H is going on guys welcome back
00:03 - to your 36th udk tutorial and in this
00:06 - tutorial we're going to be talking about
00:07 - terrain and I apologize if my voice is a
00:10 - tidbit graggy but it's 8:22 and I just
00:13 - woke up about I don't know I want to say
00:16 - 8 o' so 22 minutes AG go what the
00:20 - heck did you know that that when you
00:22 - hover over this thing it shows your
00:24 - desktop H interesting click it oh cool
00:28 - anyways that uh distracted me for a
00:31 - little bit but welcome to your 36
00:33 - tutoral and like I said we're going to
00:34 - be going over terrain now if you don't
00:37 - know what terrain is terrain is pretty
00:39 - much like the Earth whenever you create
00:41 - outdoor levels or huge Maps like World
00:44 - of Warcraft and Zelda this is the tool
00:47 - that you're going to be using to do that
00:49 - create mountains valleys Canyons even
00:51 - just big old Fields so let's go ahead
00:54 - and jump into that right now so you know
00:57 - like I said I think it's time to start
00:58 - creating terrain because our little
01:00 - buildings in our rooms I mean those are
01:03 - nice and all but for huge epic games
01:05 - we're going to need a lot more land so
01:08 - in order to create terrain here's what
01:09 - you need to do first of all go up to
01:12 - tools and click new terrain so go ahead
01:15 - and click that and it's going to give
01:16 - you a couple options first of all just
01:19 - always position it at the default unless
01:21 - you have like another map you want to
01:22 - work around and the patches is just
01:24 - think of it like the size for now just
01:26 - go ahead and put 64 by 64 and go ahead
01:30 - and click next and then layer setup
01:32 - we're just going to keep it at the
01:34 - default that's what we're going to be
01:35 - doing most of the time so click finish
01:37 - and it gives you this huge wonk and
01:40 - talkon and big old Square now this is
01:42 - your terrain right here and in these
01:45 - tutorials we're going to be working
01:47 - exclusively in the perspective view so
01:49 - go ahead and maximize that zoom out and
01:52 - Bam look at our terrain there it is so
01:56 - that's it that's all you need to know on
01:57 - terrain now we can move on to next topic
02:00 - I'm just kidding there's actually a lot
02:01 - to cover on Terin so you don't get away
02:04 - that easy so before we start making
02:07 - mountains and canyons and you know
02:09 - putting cool trees and grass on our
02:11 - terrain the first thing I'm going to do
02:14 - is add a light because whenever we're
02:16 - carving out this terrain right now we're
02:19 - in unlit mode and whenever we start
02:21 - carving things away it's going to be
02:22 - really weird if our terrain doesn't have
02:25 - any Shadows so let's go ahead and add
02:27 - some Shadows by adding a light and to
02:29 - add a light I'm going to go view browser
02:32 - windows actor classes and I'm going to
02:35 - go ahead and add a directional light and
02:38 - remember a directional light is kind of
02:40 - like the sun I said in my last tutorial
02:43 - so go ahead and right click that I mean
02:45 - excuse me left click it just select it
02:48 - and then right click in the middle and
02:50 - put add directional light here now I'm
02:53 - going to go ahead and pull this light
02:55 - way up right about there and the first
02:57 - thing I'm going to do before I even
03:00 - do anything else is Select my
03:02 - light see it's so small right here and
03:06 - press F4 and I'm going to go ahead and
03:08 - drop down display and bump this up to
03:11 - four right there since we're going to be
03:12 - working with a huge map we want our icon
03:15 - a little bigger so first of all we don't
03:17 - lose it and second of all whenever we
03:19 - want to change it we can just select it
03:20 - a little bit easier so go ahead and
03:23 - select this again and we're going to
03:24 - want to go ahead and select rotate and
03:27 - rotate it along either the Y or the
03:30 - xaxis and the reason we're rotating this
03:33 - just go ahead and move it like 15Â° or
03:36 - something 15 to 20 Dees the reason we're
03:39 - doing this is because whenever we're
03:42 - making our uh level whether it's
03:44 - mountains or Canyons or anything we want
03:47 - to give the Sun the little bit of an
03:49 - angle because remember whenever you're
03:51 - outside fishing or whatever if the sun's
03:53 - directly above you you have no shadows
03:55 - and what's the point of having the sun
03:57 - if we can't have shadows so give it a
03:59 - tid bit of an angle we can actually
04:01 - rotate it in two directions if we want
04:03 - and with that being said our sun is good
04:05 - to go that's all we're doing with the
04:07 - Sun so now let's go ahead and zoom back
04:11 - out and actually want to bump this up a
04:14 - bit let me give you guys a real good
04:16 - angle to work with oh yeah right there
04:19 - there we go and now let's go ahead and
04:21 - start making some sweet terrain so make
04:24 - sure you're in unlit mode excuse me lit
04:26 - mode which we are and go ahead and hop
04:29 - over to terrain editing mode it's right
04:31 - under camera mode and now as soon as you
04:34 - click it you get this window that pops
04:36 - up with a bunch of weird buttons and you
04:39 - know whatever the heck these things are
04:41 - and this crap over here and we're
04:43 - actually going to be covering everything
04:44 - what all these tools and check boxes are
04:47 - but for now I'm just going to tell you
04:48 - guys how to build a really simple
04:50 - terrain so in this uh tutorial I just
04:53 - want to give you guys a real quick Dirty
04:54 - tutorial on how to build a real basic
04:57 - terrain and in the upcoming tutorials
04:59 - I'm going to showing you guys all the
05:00 - little details about it so anyways to
05:03 - build a very basic terrain you're going
05:06 - to be using this one tool right here
05:08 - it's paint and right now we're going to
05:10 - be working on the height map now right
05:13 - down here is a bunch of different layers
05:15 - you can have for your terrain the first
05:17 - layer that you always have is your
05:19 - height map and what a height map is is
05:22 - it's a grayscale map a black and white
05:24 - map just like a shadow map or light map
05:27 - or when we were working with maps with
05:28 - materials this is another kind of map
05:31 - wherever there's white it's going to be
05:33 - raised like a mountain wherever it's
05:35 - black it's going to be indented like a
05:37 - camera so those that's basically what
05:39 - we're going to be painting on right now
05:41 - black and white even though we aren't
05:43 - going to see black and white we're going
05:44 - to see mountains and canyons that's what
05:46 - a hype map is so you can also make hype
05:49 - maps in like Photoshop or any paint
05:51 - program and stuff like that but we're
05:52 - just going to be doing it in uh the udk
05:55 - for now so go ahead and have your hype
05:58 - map selected and go ahead and check
06:00 - paint right here now right here is your
06:03 - brush settings the strength of your
06:05 - brush is if you think of it in real
06:07 - world how hard you're pressing down on
06:09 - your brush the radius I probably don't
06:12 - even explain these things but it's
06:14 - basically how wide your brushes so just
06:17 - go ahead and leave these somewhere in
06:18 - the middle and the fall off is the
06:20 - gradient from the middle being pressed
06:22 - down the hardest to it fading off on the
06:25 - edges so it's kind of like Fanning out
06:28 - if you have a big fall off so go ahead
06:30 - and leave it somewhere like that for now
06:33 - and you can go ahead and begin painting
06:35 - so you're probably thinking all right
06:36 - just go ahead and left click and paint
06:38 - but nothing's really going on and that's
06:41 - because a left click remember is the
06:42 - move to camera the camera around so in
06:45 - order to paint hold down control on your
06:47 - keyboard and with control held down you
06:50 - can go ahead and check it
06:52 - out oh yeah look at that so as you can
06:56 - see if I hold it in one place that might
06:57 - be a little easier to see that we're
06:59 - getting a nice little Ridge and so
07:03 - that's basically how you paint hold down
07:04 - control on your keyboard and left click
07:08 - with the mouse so maybe if I do this
07:11 - Edge it'll be a little bit easier to see
07:14 - pretty cool huh and a nice little tidbit
07:16 - of information if you hold down control
07:18 - on your keyboard and right click with
07:20 - your mouse what it's going to do is
07:21 - indent the map just like this but he's
07:24 - saying all right Bucky that's nice and
07:26 - all but first of all what kind of
07:29 - terrain looks like a big old checker
07:30 - board this terrain is kind of hard to
07:32 - tell what we're working with you know
07:34 - this gray and purple blocks so what we
07:36 - need is some nice material some nice
07:39 - grassy ground covering and that way we
07:42 - can really easily see what we're working
07:44 - with so I'm actually going to be adding
07:46 - some nice grass and probably some nice I
07:49 - don't know Rocky or Pathways in the next
07:52 - tutorial but I guess you're going to
07:54 - have to watch that one to uh you know
07:56 - see what's going on then so for now
07:58 - that's the basics of having you paint
07:59 - and how you create a Terrain and also
08:01 - don't forget to add your sun because it
08:03 - looks better in lit mode than unlit mode
08:05 - as you can see lit has Shadows unlit
08:09 - does not so in the next tutorial we're
08:11 - going to be adding some grass but for
08:12 - now that's all you guys get so thank you
08:14 - guys for watching don't forget subscribe
08:15 - and I'll see you then
