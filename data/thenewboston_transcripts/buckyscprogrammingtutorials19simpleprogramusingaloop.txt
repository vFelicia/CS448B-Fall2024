00:00 - what's going on guys it's Bucky and
00:01 - welcome to your 19th C++ tutorial and
00:04 - you know what all these nice little
00:07 - quick examples are fine and Dany but
00:09 - let's go ahead and build a program that
00:11 - is actually somewhat useful a program
00:14 - that you can use and you know maybe your
00:16 - teacher assigned you something or maybe
00:17 - your boss came to you and was like you
00:19 - know what Bucky I want you to make a
00:21 - program that allows the user to enter
00:24 - five different numbers and then I want
00:27 - you to total the numbers for them but
00:30 - you have to use a wall Loop so we're
00:31 - saying all right no problem so here is
00:34 - how I would go about making this program
00:36 - and by the way this is some nice little
00:38 - programming tips you start with the
00:41 - basics of your program and you do it in
00:43 - little baby steps so first of all I want
00:46 - to make a loop that runs five different
00:48 - times so what I would do is make a loop
00:50 - int X set this variable equal to one
00:53 - this is just going to be the looping
00:55 - variable
00:57 - while X is less than or equal to to five
01:01 - let's just go ahead and print out
01:03 - something to make sure our Loop is
01:04 - working see out x n line so that's going
01:09 - to print out X and you know how I said
01:11 - that in order to add one to X each time
01:13 - you go ahead and write xal x + 1 well
01:17 - you can do that but let me let you guys
01:19 - in on a little secret if you go ahead
01:21 - and write
01:22 - x++ this is the exact same as writing X
01:26 - Plus x = x + 1 it's just a quicker and
01:30 - easier way to do things and that's
01:32 - actually where the name C++ came from
01:34 - they wanted it to be C and you know
01:37 - anyways that's the history of C++ it
01:39 - came from an old language called C and
01:41 - they added two little plus signs to it
01:43 - thought it was cute so anyways that's
01:45 - your history see but what we're worried
01:47 - about is making sure that we have a
01:49 - working Loop that runs five times so
01:51 - let's go ahead and run this so all right
01:54 - 1 2 3 4 5 our Loop is working perfectly
01:58 - we can now move on to next step and by
02:00 - the way this was just a tester line we
02:02 - don't really need that in our program so
02:04 - they're saying all right our boss told
02:06 - us to make a program so the user can
02:09 - enter five different numbers so we
02:12 - already know that the cin is the way
02:15 - that the user can enter a number but we
02:17 - probably need to store that number in a
02:19 - variable so let's go ahead and store
02:21 - that number in a variable number and
02:24 - since we don't know the value yet we
02:25 - can't set that equal to anything yet so
02:28 - what we would do in order to to have the
02:30 - user enter a number five times is inside
02:33 - this Loop go ahead and write cin number
02:37 - now our Loop is going to run five times
02:39 - and the user is going to enter a number
02:41 - each time before the program quits so
02:44 - what I would do now is test the program
02:46 - again just to make sure it's working all
02:48 - right 43 54 66 2 and three enter our
02:54 - program's done so now we see not only do
02:57 - we got a loop that runs five times but
02:59 - but we also have the user enter five
03:02 - different numbers so our program is
03:04 - working five and dandy so far so we're
03:07 - saying all right now what's the last
03:09 - thing he said oh yeah he wanted to find
03:13 - a sum of all those numbers and print it
03:15 - out to the user or something so we're
03:17 - saying all right now not only a number
03:20 - variable but we need another variable to
03:23 - hold the sum or the total of all those
03:25 - numbers so what I would do is go ahead
03:28 - and put int total and by default their
03:31 - total is going to be zero because they
03:33 - didn't enter any numbers yet that's what
03:36 - we know so now what we can do is this
03:39 - you might be thinking this so just go
03:41 - ahead and set total equal to number but
03:44 - whenever we run this it's not going to
03:46 - work because say they enter 10 the first
03:48 - time where then total is equal to 10
03:51 - okay it's working fine so far but the
03:53 - next time they enter eight and we were
03:55 - expecting 18 well this isn't being added
03:58 - to total total is now being changed to
04:00 - eight so instead of being 18 it's just8
04:03 - so this isn't going to work so what we
04:05 - need to do is do this total equals the
04:09 - old total plus the new number so now
04:12 - what happens is this whenever they
04:15 - answer 10 it's going to be 0 + 10 total
04:19 - is equal to 10 the next time they enter
04:22 - 8 8 equals number so 10 + 8 equals a new
04:27 - total of 18 so let's go ahead head and
04:30 - once this Loop is done running let's go
04:32 - ahead and just give him a nice little
04:34 - print out on the screen um your total
04:40 - is total and might as well end that line
04:44 - why not so let's go ahead and run this
04:47 - program and now let's go ahead and run
04:50 - it and make sure it works so let's go
04:52 - ahead and put 10 enter 8 enter two enter
04:58 - five enter five enter your total is 30
05:03 - so all right let's go review this one
05:05 - last time it seems like everything is
05:07 - working fine let's just go ahead and
05:09 - make sure well I guess I can cover that
05:11 - up that says end line there now I'm
05:13 - covering it up so basically the first
05:16 - time the first thing we did is we got a
05:18 - loop that worked then we wanted to have
05:21 - the user enter a number and then we did
05:24 - something with that number so what
05:26 - happened is this the first time the user
05:28 - entered a number it was 10 so the total
05:31 - which was Zero before is now equal to 0
05:35 - + 10 so now total equals 10 the next
05:39 - number they entered was 8 so now the new
05:42 - Total is 10 + 8 which was 18 the next
05:46 - number that entered was two so 18 + 2
05:49 - now total equals 20 next number was five
05:52 - now it equals 25 the last one was five
05:55 - also now it equals 30 so this is
05:58 - basically saying all right take the new
06:00 - value of total and set it equal to the
06:03 - old Value Plus the number that they
06:04 - entered and at the end we just said your
06:07 - total is 30 works pretty good so let's
06:10 - go ahead and just to make sure that it's
06:13 - working good let's really test this add
06:16 - some big numbers like
06:18 - this why why do I keep entering the same
06:21 - number each time and that so you know
06:25 - okay I'm not going to check this in my
06:26 - head but you guys can go ahead and check
06:28 - that out on the calculator and if it
06:30 - works then it means we just built the
06:32 - best calculator on Earth so I'm actually
06:35 - going to go ahead and copy this and
06:37 - email this to Microsoft and hopefully
06:39 - they pay me you know just a couple
06:41 - million dollars for it so you go ahead
06:44 - and what I want to stress in this
06:46 - tutorial is this not only this is how
06:48 - you build a basic program to you know
06:52 - it's just an example of why a while loop
06:54 - would be useful but also whenever you're
06:56 - building programs take it in baby steps
06:59 - do the most basic thing first and then
07:01 - once you got that working go on to the
07:03 - next step and then on that working you
07:05 - can go on to the final step and now we
07:08 - can do something like maybe we can find
07:10 - the average of all these number or maybe
07:12 - we can um find the product or the
07:15 - quotient or something stupid so again
07:17 - take your program in baby steps that way
07:20 - you don't try to build a whole program
07:22 - and then at the end when you got 10
07:23 - different errors you're saying all right
07:25 - what went wrong so that is the basics of
07:28 - not only how to be a good good
07:29 - programmer but also how to use the wall
07:31 - Loop in a meaningful way so for now
07:34 - thank you guys for watching um like I
07:36 - said just going to go ahead cut this and
07:38 - paste it to Microsoft and uh yeah I'll
07:40 - see you in the next tutorial when I'm a
07:42 - millionaire
