00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the new boston
00:05 - in this tutorial we're gonna be taking a
00:07 - look at some chair well one jquery
00:09 - utility which is in array now if you've
00:12 - written code in PHP or any other web
00:15 - development back-end language you'll
00:18 - know that you can check for a particular
00:19 - element by supplying the element value
00:23 - and this will check whether it's in an
00:26 - array so you have a few functions in
00:28 - different languages that will do this
00:30 - however we can do this in the front end
00:32 - with jQuery now this can be done in
00:35 - JavaScript alone as well but in jQuery
00:38 - we make it particularly easy now the
00:41 - first thing I've done is gone ahead and
00:43 - include this file utility s which just
00:46 - stands for utilities j/s and I've have
00:49 - this open in my text editor so we can
00:51 - make use of this code on the page so I'm
00:54 - going to go ahead and demonstrate the
00:55 - inner a utility first and then we'll go
00:58 - ahead and create a very short
01:00 - application that will utilize this
01:03 - function so I'm going to go ahead and
01:06 - wait for the document to be ready so
01:07 - this is what we would usually do in our
01:10 - jQuery code once the document has loaded
01:13 - and it's ready I'm going to go ahead and
01:15 - initialize or create an array so I'm
01:18 - going to give this a 1 I'm going to
01:19 - create a variable and I'm gonna give
01:21 - this a value of names the array name is
01:24 - names now inside these square brackets
01:26 - we can supply different values so I'm
01:28 - gonna give this 3 names and I'm just
01:32 - gonna fill in the data here so Alex
01:34 - Billy and then Dale ok so now what we
01:37 - can do is we can use the in array
01:41 - utility to check whether a particular
01:42 - element is in an array so for example if
01:46 - we were to specify Alex in this it would
01:48 - return that we have got something in an
01:51 - array now it's important to know what
01:54 - the function if you like if you want to
01:56 - call it a function actually returns
01:58 - let's say we were to use this utility
02:00 - and supply the value Alex now we would
02:04 - actually retrieve the value 0 back from
02:07 - this and the reason this is important is
02:09 - because when you're putting this into an
02:11 - if statement condition
02:13 - need to know which values it's returning
02:14 - or you'll get inaccurate results so if
02:18 - we were to go ahead and search in the
02:20 - array for Billy it would return the
02:22 - value one and that's because it's at a
02:23 - key index of one so it's no good just
02:27 - putting the inner a utility inside a
02:29 - condition because it may still return
02:31 - zero and in this case the block wouldn't
02:33 - run so let's go ahead and demonstrate
02:36 - this I'm gonna create an if statement
02:38 - and this condition will be it's jQuery
02:42 - dot in array remember in this case we
02:46 - have a capital I in a small I as well as
02:49 - the jQuery with a small J and a big Q so
02:53 - it is case sensitive so you need to make
02:55 - sure you're working with the correct
02:57 - case and inside of here we're gonna
03:00 - supply two parameters the first one is
03:02 - the value that we're looking for so the
03:03 - value of an element so I'm going to type
03:06 - go ahead and type in Alex
03:07 - in fact we'll go ahead and type in Billy
03:09 - first and then I'm gonna the second
03:12 - parameter supply the names variable so
03:14 - we're looking for this value Billy
03:16 - inside of names now usually you would
03:19 - just be allowed to say you know with
03:21 - normal functions use this condition in
03:23 - because it would probably a function
03:24 - would probably return true or false and
03:27 - you would expect in a ray to probably go
03:30 - ahead and just return true if it is
03:31 - found so inside this block will go ahead
03:34 - and alert found and you'll notice that
03:39 - we will return this alert because it
03:42 - will have even found however the only
03:44 - reason we're gonna actually alert out
03:46 - now is because Billy is at key one if we
03:49 - were to change this a bit later to Alex
03:51 - we wouldn't get this alert box out so
03:53 - let's go ahead and refresh and you can
03:55 - see we've got a dialog box hang found
03:57 - let's go ahead and change this value now
03:59 - to Alex and see what happens
04:01 - remember this function will now return
04:03 - zero that's refresh and you see nothing
04:05 - happens so we need to check this that it
04:09 - doesn't equal to a particular value and
04:11 - this value is minus one if a key is not
04:15 - found in a and array or an element isn't
04:17 - found in an array this function here
04:19 - this in a red function will return minus
04:21 - one so we want to say where it doesn't
04:24 - equal mine
04:25 - one and in this case it will you know
04:28 - return Allah regardless of the fact that
04:30 - Alex is at position zero because zero
04:32 - doesn't equal minus one so now when we
04:35 - refresh you see we have the found dialog
04:37 - box okay let's go ahead and create a
04:39 - sample application I'm gonna get rid of
04:41 - this code here and I'm gonna return to
04:44 - index dot PHP and we'll just go ahead
04:46 - and type out a form a quick and basic
04:49 - form I'm gonna have an input type with
04:52 - text so we're gonna allow the user to
04:53 - enter some text and I'm gonna give this
04:55 - an ID of name just after this I'm gonna
04:59 - create a button so input type button and
05:01 - the value of this I'm just going to say
05:04 - check so the ID of this we could just
05:07 - call check so now we can create an event
05:11 - handler for check and then pick up the
05:13 - value that's been entered into the name
05:15 - and then go ahead and put that into an
05:17 - if statement so we're creating something
05:18 - the user can actually use so the first
05:21 - thing we want to do inside here is we
05:23 - want to create an event handler for our
05:25 - check button so we say check click and
05:28 - inside here we want to go ahead and
05:30 - create a function pull that down bit so
05:32 - it's easier for us to write inside or to
05:35 - view and once we've once we've clicked
05:39 - the textbox we want to go ahead and set
05:42 - the variable name of the value of inside
05:47 - of this text field so let's go ahead and
05:49 - create a new variable called name and
05:51 - that's going to be equal to the value of
05:54 - our name text box so that's dot Val
05:58 - quite simple so now that we've stored
06:00 - this name we can go ahead and utilize
06:02 - this in array utility in jQuery and
06:05 - check whether this name that the user
06:07 - has entered is actually inside this
06:09 - array so for now I'm gonna go ahead and
06:11 - just alert out name just to check that
06:13 - everything's working I'll go ahead and
06:15 - refresh and type in a name here click
06:18 - check and that gives us the value back
06:20 - so we know what that we're passing the
06:21 - value into this name variable okay so
06:24 - now what I'm going to go ahead and do is
06:26 - perform an if statement
06:28 - and this if statement is going to be
06:30 - jQuery in array and then we supplied
06:34 - with two parameters the first one is the
06:36 - name that we're looking for and then the
06:38 - array name now if this doesn't equal
06:41 - minus one we can go ahead and alert out
06:45 - something otherwise we want to go ahead
06:48 - and alert something so essentially what
06:51 - we're doing is if the if the element has
06:53 - been found we want to alert something if
06:55 - it hasn't been found we also want to
06:57 - alert something and this is just going
06:58 - to be named and appending on is in the
07:03 - array and for the fact if it hasn't you
07:07 - know if this returns anything else than
07:08 - minus one we're going to go ahead and
07:11 - say name plus is not in the array okay
07:18 - so now let's go ahead and test this when
07:20 - we refresh we can type in a name so I'm
07:22 - going to type in Alex and you'll see it
07:24 - says Alex is in the array let's go ahead
07:27 - and type another name that's in that
07:29 - array so Billy click check Billy is in
07:31 - the array now let's go ahead and type a
07:33 - name that isn't actually in the array
07:35 - click check and it tells us that is not
07:38 - in the array so lastly why might you use
07:41 - this well you might want to store say
07:43 - something that the user has given on the
07:45 - front end either temporarily inside of
07:48 - an array in JavaScript on the front end
07:50 - of your document rather than
07:52 - transferring the data for example to PHP
07:54 - or another web development language so
07:57 - using arrays saves time so you can go
08:00 - ahead and create an array like this and
08:02 - add elements to an array as you usually
08:03 - would and then you can use this in a way
08:06 - there are some other functions such as
08:08 - is array and make array which will
08:10 - convert arrays but we're not going to be
08:12 - covering them because I think the in
08:15 - array is probably the most used utility
08:17 - as part of this jQuery set so that's
08:20 - just a quick demonstration of in array
08:22 - and how you can check values inside a
08:24 - specific array with jQuery
