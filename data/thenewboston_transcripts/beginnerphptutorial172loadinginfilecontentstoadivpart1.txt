00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:02 - and this is a video tutorial for the new
00:04 - Boston now in this tutorial we're going
00:07 - to be looking at opening up a another
00:09 - file using Ajax so I've got my file over
00:12 - here called including PHP and this
00:15 - contains PHP code because we're talking
00:17 - about Ajax relative to PHP we have
00:21 - created this one I've created this PHP
00:23 - document called include Inc PHP which
00:26 - has PHP code inside it so eventually as
00:29 - we progress through the Ajax series what
00:32 - we're going to look at is opening a file
00:36 - that's going to say maybe grab some
00:38 - values from a database or something like
00:40 - that and eventually we'll learn how to
00:44 - produce dynamic content so when a user
00:47 - say moves the mouse button we update em
00:50 - say index dot PHP page with relevant
00:53 - data or when we type something we update
00:56 - with it with relevant data from a
00:57 - database but before we do this what we
00:59 - need to think about is how we're
01:01 - actually going to open a file without
01:03 - refreshing the page so as you know in
01:06 - PHP we can use things like include and
01:09 - then we can include a specific a
01:11 - specific fast which will include Inc dot
01:14 - PHP but this is useless to us because
01:16 - it's only including the contents of the
01:20 - file we're not triggering anything what
01:22 - we could do is we could create a form
01:24 - under here or a button under here which
01:27 - would take us to the page so we could
01:29 - say input type equals submit and then we
01:34 - could say on click and then we can
01:37 - incorporate some JavaScript in here so
01:39 - we could say window dot location equals
01:42 - index dot PHP show equals include for
01:48 - example and then what we could do is we
01:50 - could come down and we can say if is set
01:52 - dollar underscore get because we're
01:54 - passing a get variable called show the
01:57 - get variable show could go in there then
01:59 - we could say include oh sorry
02:02 - it's a combination of including echo the
02:05 - include dollar underscore get
02:08 - so so what we can do is we can well we
02:12 - can pass that including geography there
02:14 - so we're passing a variable through when
02:17 - we click on a button
02:17 - including pH P is then going to be
02:20 - checked to see if something anything
02:21 - exists and then it's going to include
02:23 - the relevant file so here what we can do
02:25 - is if we go back to our page we can
02:27 - click on submit and that'll include our
02:30 - file however we want to do that without
02:32 - refreshing the page you notice if we go
02:34 - back and we click on submit you see that
02:36 - we refresh the page and we've come up
02:38 - with we've would Betty gone on to index
02:41 - dot PHP again but with this show
02:43 - variable here so what we want to do is
02:45 - we want to achieve a similar effect to
02:48 - this however we don't want to refresh
02:50 - the page and we're going to be dealing
02:51 - with divs as well so we're going to have
02:54 - a div and this is going to be filled
02:57 - with some content from including dot PHP
03:00 - so the first thing I'm going to do is
03:02 - I'm going to create a standard outline
03:05 - from HTML document so I'm going to
03:07 - create some head tags and body tags here
03:09 - and obviously our route HTML tags at the
03:12 - end inside head we're going to be
03:15 - putting all the JavaScript inside body
03:17 - we're going to insert the button and the
03:20 - div itself so we're not actually writing
03:22 - any PHP in this file but the point of
03:24 - the tutorial is to show you how we can
03:26 - use Ajax to UM load in this include file
03:30 - which is a PHP document and has PHP code
03:33 - inside of it so the first thing we want
03:36 - to do is create what we want to show on
03:38 - the website on the page rather so I'm
03:40 - going to put another input button and
03:42 - that's going to be submit like we just
03:44 - like I've just shown you in the previous
03:45 - example however this time I'm going to
03:49 - say on click equals load and this is
03:55 - going to call a function that we're
03:56 - going to write up here in a minute in
03:58 - our head in inside some script tags so
04:02 - we're going to declare that we want to
04:04 - write some JavaScript code and then
04:06 - we're going to call this function when
04:09 - we when we click the button so we'll
04:11 - test this out in just a moment but for
04:13 - now as well I want to put an ID and I'm
04:15 - going to give it the div sorry I'm going
04:17 - to give it the ID a
04:19 - and then we're going to close it there
04:21 - we're not going to write any content in
04:23 - here okay so we're not writing any
04:25 - content in here we're going to rely on
04:27 - us clicking this button load function up
04:30 - here loading content into this div and
04:33 - we're going to do that without
04:34 - refreshing the page at all so you may
04:36 - have gone onto a website where it says
04:38 - maybe click here or there's a column of
04:42 - options and you click it and it
04:43 - instantly gives you the content on to
04:45 - the right of it this is a very similar
04:49 - thing that we're doing here but we're
04:52 - loading in this include ink dot PHP into
04:54 - this div again without refreshing the
04:56 - page so let's come up here and create
04:58 - our script tag so script type equals and
05:01 - that's text forward slash JavaScript so
05:04 - we can tell our browser that we've got
05:06 - JavaScript code in here now let's give
05:10 - this a test so I want to test when we
05:12 - click on this button here that we
05:15 - execute or call a function called load
05:18 - let's just set up our load function here
05:20 - so we've got function load here we're
05:22 - not giving it any parameters but what we
05:24 - are going to do is just alert work so we
05:28 - know that everything works so when we
05:29 - click on this button we've got this on
05:31 - click event here then we're going to
05:33 - call the function load we're going to
05:35 - come up here call this function and
05:36 - we're going to create an alert so let's
05:40 - go back to our index dot PHP page okay
05:44 - so we've got our submit button we click
05:46 - it and we get a message saying works so
05:49 - we know that everything works now what
05:51 - we can do is get on with creating our
05:53 - Ajax code now we need to do a variety of
05:57 - checks this is pretty standard code and
05:59 - I'm not going to explain exactly how it
06:02 - works and what each function does and
06:04 - but follow along the example and you'll
06:06 - generally get an idea of what's
06:08 - happening I will explain most elements
06:10 - as much as I can possibly explain in the
06:12 - video without confusing myself and we'll
06:16 - go along and we'll write this out
