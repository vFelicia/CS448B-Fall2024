00:01 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:06 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:08 - taking a look at exiting a for loop
00:11 - early now let's go ahead and get started
00:15 - we'll create a new project select
00:19 - console application and we'll just name
00:22 - it exit for loop and then click OK
00:26 - now I'll just wait for it to load our
00:28 - project and we'll zoom in a bit here ok
00:35 - so now let's go ahead and create our for
00:37 - loop first let's type console dot write
00:42 - line and we'll just label this one as
00:45 - normal for loop now let's go ahead and
00:52 - create a simple for loop so for number
00:57 - one equals one to 30 let's go ahead and
01:04 - print out num1
01:05 - so console dot write line num1 so this
01:13 - is a very fairly simple for loop now
01:15 - let's just add a space here so there
01:19 - will be an empty line and now let's tell
01:21 - them that this is a for loop that is
01:24 - exited when num1 is equal to a certain
01:26 - value so console dot write line for loop
01:34 - that exits before it's finished
01:43 - so now let's create another for loop so
01:46 - for num1 equals 1 to 30 let's go ahead
01:51 - and do console dot write line num1 okay
01:58 - so now what we're going to do is we are
02:00 - going to test the value of num1 to see
02:03 - if it's equal to something and if it is
02:05 - then we're going to go ahead and exit
02:07 - the for loop so we're going to do this
02:08 - by using a simple if statement so if
02:11 - num1 equals 23 then what are we going to
02:18 - do we're just going to use the keyword
02:19 - exit which is exits a procedure or block
02:22 - and transfers execution immediately to
02:24 - the statement following the procedure
02:26 - call or block definition so basically
02:30 - what that means is that if num1 is equal
02:32 - to 23 it's going to hit this exit
02:35 - statement and it's going to skip all the
02:36 - way down to this line right here where
02:38 - i'm typing these commenting because that
02:42 - is after the if statement and this after
02:45 - the for loop so now if we go ahead and
02:47 - run this you can see it closes there
02:51 - let's go ahead and do a console dot read
02:55 - line
03:00 - okay so let's go ahead and scroll up to
03:02 - the top and you can see it says normal
03:04 - for loop and it says one two three four
03:07 - five and so on all the way down until it
03:09 - gets to the value thirty and now it says
03:12 - for loop that exits before it's finished
03:14 - it starts at the value 1 and then it
03:17 - goes all the way down to the value 23
03:18 - and then it exits the for loop now we
03:24 - can also do this if we step the value so
03:28 - for number 1 equals 1 to 30 and if we
03:32 - step by 4 then you can see that is this
03:38 - if statement it's never going to run so
03:40 - if we run this you can see it's all the
03:42 - way to 29 and it doesn't stop at 24 so
03:46 - what we can do is we can do if num 1
03:50 - just a load here
03:58 - okay so if num1 is greater than 23 then
04:04 - exit the for loop so you can see that it
04:08 - goes 1 5 9 13 17 21 25 and then it exits
04:13 - a four loop because num 1 is greater
04:15 - than 23 so go ahead and make a couple
04:20 - for loops that exit under a certain
04:23 - condition and then once you've got that
04:25 - down and you'll remember it go ahead and
04:27 - move on to the next tutorial so thanks
04:29 - for watching
