00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash online gamer for the new boston
00:04 - and in this tutorial we're going to
00:07 - continue working on our paint program
00:08 - now this can be found in the book
00:10 - beginning Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 by
00:13 - Theron Willis and Brian Newsome and this
00:16 - is public published by rocks now this
00:18 - option form and changing the color and
00:21 - the brush sizes we're all my idea I just
00:24 - took the base of their paint program
00:26 - walked you guys to it and then we
00:27 - created this form right here that will
00:30 - let you change the brush size and the
00:31 - color so what we're going to be doing in
00:33 - this tutorial is we're going to allow
00:35 - the user to clear the canvas and start
00:37 - over so we will make this a little bit
00:41 - bigger and let's add a button so we'll
00:48 - set the text to new canvas
00:53 - and then we will set the name to button
00:57 - clear so whenever they click new canvas
01:01 - what do we want to do well we want to
01:03 - clear everything that is on our paint
01:05 - canvas VB so let's come over here in the
01:08 - paint canvas dot VB which is our class
01:10 - that the control uses and we'll create a
01:13 - public method so public sub clear canvas
01:20 - and this is isn't going to take any
01:23 - arguments
01:24 - so we'll just access graphics items dot
01:33 - clear so we created this array list
01:37 - called graphics items and what graphics
01:40 - items does is a source every single
01:43 - shape that is drawn on the screen
01:45 - whenever we click and drag around so it
01:48 - paints these onto the screen when we're
01:50 - drawing now if there's nothing inside of
01:53 - this array list then it's not going to
01:55 - pay anything to the screen so if we get
01:57 - rid of everything in it by calling clear
01:59 - all of our graphics items are going to
02:01 - be gone all of our circles and now what
02:05 - we need to do is make the canvas refresh
02:09 - so we'll call me dot invalidate so this
02:13 - says oh no I have to repaint the the
02:19 - canvas because it has been invalidated
02:21 - and it needs to be updated
02:23 - so under opt-in form whenever they click
02:26 - button clear what we want to do is we
02:30 - want to access our my paint form so my
02:33 - paint is a type form 1 and it's an
02:36 - object so we'll do my paint not paint
02:39 - canvas one which is an object of paint
02:41 - canvas that is inside of my paint then
02:44 - we want to call clear canvas so we
02:49 - access our form then the object of the
02:52 - control in our form then we access the
02:54 - clear canvas method inside of that so
02:57 - we'll go ahead and run it here is paint
03:00 - vb we'll set the brush size to say large
03:03 - or me
03:04 - you and will change the color to red we
03:07 - can go ahead and just draw as much as we
03:09 - want and then when we click new canvas
03:11 - you can see that it erases everything on
03:14 - our canvas and we can start over so I
03:19 - will change the color to black and we
03:22 - can continue drawing so you can also
03:26 - have it set the brush size back to the
03:29 - default and the color back to the
03:30 - default if you click new canvas but
03:33 - we're not going to be covering that in
03:34 - this tutorial I'm you guys know enough
03:36 - about programming already that you
03:39 - should be able to do it you would just
03:41 - set the color property and then set the
03:43 - brush size property whatever they click
03:45 - the button which is quite simple so go
03:49 - ahead and make this program if you
03:50 - haven't already and then if you have any
03:53 - changes you made to it to make it better
03:55 - or to add some functionality go ahead
03:59 - and leave a video response if you can or
04:02 - tell us in the comments what you've done
04:04 - and if you made it and you just want to
04:05 - show it off then you can go ahead and
04:07 - leave a video response as well so thanks
04:12 - for watching this series on painting the
04:14 - creating the paint program in Visual
04:16 - Basic and upcoming in the next tutorials
04:20 - we're gonna be working on other programs
