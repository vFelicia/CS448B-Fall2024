00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:06 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:08 - using some of the things that you've
00:09 - learned in the last tutorials to make a
00:11 - simple calculator program so let's go
00:14 - ahead and get started we're going to go
00:16 - ahead and give some space down here in
00:18 - our main sub and we're going to prompt
00:20 - the user to input a value so we'll use
00:23 - console dot write line please enter the
00:29 - first number now what we're going to do
00:35 - is we're going to declare a variable and
00:37 - we're going to use console dot readline
00:39 - to store the information in that
00:41 - variable so we'll use the dim keyword so
00:44 - dim num1 as double and we'll just set it
00:50 - equal to console dot read line so if you
00:58 - want to read a value from the line or if
01:00 - you want to get the input that the user
01:01 - is putting in you can declare the
01:03 - variable and assign it to console dot
01:05 - readline at the same time you can do all
01:07 - this in one line which saves you some
01:09 - coding time so now that we have our
01:13 - first number we're going to use console
01:17 - dot write line and we're just going to
01:21 - tell the user what their first number is
01:22 - so that they know that the program
01:25 - received it correctly so I'll do first
01:31 - number and we'll just use the + sign and
01:35 - we'll print out num1 now what we're
01:40 - going to do is we're going to prompt
01:41 - them to enter a second number so we will
01:45 - use console dot write line please enter
01:52 - the second number
01:59 - now we're going to create another
02:01 - variable so we will use the dim keyword
02:04 - will do dim num2 as double and we'll set
02:10 - it equal to console dot readline so this
02:15 - does the same thing that we did up here
02:17 - in declaring num1 and we use console dot
02:21 - readline and instead of number one down
02:23 - here we're going to want num2
02:24 - okay so now we're going to print out the
02:27 - answer but first we're going to tell
02:28 - them that we receive their first number
02:30 - correctly so console dot write line
02:36 - second number and now we're going to
02:43 - create a third variable with we will dim
02:46 - it and we'll type answer as the name and
02:51 - we want to make it a double and we'll
02:53 - set it equal to num 1 times num2 so now
03:01 - we're just going to print that out so
03:03 - console dot write line answer and we'll
03:10 - set that equal to answer or will add
03:12 - answer to that and we need to use the +
03:16 - sign right here so now if we run this
03:19 - program it will say please enter the
03:23 - first number so if I type 32 and press
03:27 - ENTER it's going to tell me the first
03:29 - number is 32 and it's going to ask me
03:31 - for the second number so let's do 45 and
03:35 - you can see closed on us right there so
03:38 - we need to add console dot read line
03:46 - okay so we'll enter the first number 34
03:48 - it says first number 34 and we'll enter
03:51 - the second number 45 and when we press
03:54 - ENTER it will tell us the second number
03:55 - and it'll tell us to answer so now let's
04:00 - go down here and let's just specify what
04:03 - the calculator did so we'll do the
04:05 - numbers multiplied is and it's going to
04:10 - give us the answer now what we can do to
04:12 - save time is we can get rid of answer
04:15 - all by itself and instead of printing up
04:18 - printing out the answer we can do num1
04:21 - times
04:22 - num2 so what this does is it takes on
04:27 - number one and multiplies it by num2 and
04:29 - it only does that in the arguments of
04:31 - console dot write line so it's not
04:33 - sorted as a variable it's just going to
04:34 - print out that number and then it's not
04:36 - going to save it anywhere now you can
04:38 - choose which one you want to do if you
04:40 - want to use answer later on then I would
04:42 - suggest declaring that variable and
04:44 - storing it in there because if you want
04:46 - the answer later on and you didn't
04:48 - declare a variable for it you won't be
04:51 - able to get the answer because the only
04:52 - time that you have the answer printed
04:54 - out on the screen
04:55 - or stored anywhere is when it writes
04:57 - this line and it multiplies them
04:59 - together so you can go ahead and play
05:02 - around with it you can make it multiply
05:04 - you can make a divide you can make it
05:06 - add whatever you want and then once
05:08 - you've got that nailed down move on to
05:09 - the next tutorial
