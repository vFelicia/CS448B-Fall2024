00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog
00:02 - with a video for the New Boston in this
00:05 - video we're going to be looking at the
00:06 - jQuery ID selector and selecting
00:09 - elements by their ID so let's go ahead
00:12 - and first of all create an element on
00:14 - our page I've already got selectors j/s
00:17 - attached to my page or included in my
00:19 - page and we're going to be writing some
00:21 - code in here to return a value from from
00:24 - a particular element by its ID so let's
00:28 - go ahead and create for example an input
00:31 - field and this is going to be type of
00:36 - text and we're going to give this an ID
00:38 - of name okay so now that we have this we
00:42 - want to reference this by name we've
00:45 - given it the ID of name therefore we can
00:48 - uniquely reference this as an ID so
00:52 - inside selectors we're going to want to
00:54 - well let's just first of all put in here
00:57 - a value of hello so when we refresh our
01:02 - page you can see that we've just got
01:04 - hello inside of a text area field okay
01:08 - so now inside selectors or j/s if we
01:10 - want to reference or refer to this field
01:13 - we can refer to it by its unique name we
01:16 - could go and refer to it by an input
01:18 - field however because we've specified an
01:20 - ID we can use a hash and then the name
01:23 - of the particular element to actually
01:26 - grab a value from it so inside selectors
01:29 - we just want to create a variable and
01:31 - this is going to be called name now
01:33 - we're going to use the selector here so
01:36 - this is a selector inside here we're
01:38 - going to select name but we don't want
01:41 - to just put name inside here we want to
01:44 - use a hash because we've used an ID so
01:47 - this is saying grab the element with the
01:49 - ID of name and then we want to return
01:52 - the value inside of that so Val just is
01:56 - going to return this value inside of
01:58 - here so that's not really important for
02:00 - now but we're just taking a look at
02:02 - concentrating on how we've selected this
02:04 - ID okay so now we want to go ahead and
02:07 - alert that out so we want alert name
02:10 - remember now
02:11 - now contains the value of the name field
02:15 - so when we refresh this we should be
02:18 - greeted by hello because essentially
02:20 - what's happened is we've taken this
02:22 - value from this field here by its ID and
02:25 - then we've just had alerted this out to
02:28 - the user so now that we've selected by
02:31 - an ID in a field what else can we do
02:33 - well almost any element in HTML can be
02:36 - have an ID attached
02:38 - for example paragraphing we could give
02:41 - an ID to a paragraph so text for example
02:44 - and some text we could then go to
02:48 - selectors j/s and just simply change
02:50 - this around so this could be text this
02:54 - could be text and then we'll change this
02:57 - variable as well accordingly so now
02:59 - we've got the tÃªte the value of text
03:02 - let's go ahead and refresh the page
03:04 - oh no sorry we also need to change this
03:06 - here we need to grab the text from this
03:09 - so this essentially takes text from
03:12 - inside the paragraph and we're
03:15 - referencing the paragraph as hash text
03:17 - because we've called it text just here
03:19 - let's go ahead and refresh you can see
03:22 - that we've got some text in an alert
03:24 - field so with regards to the ID selector
03:29 - you can give an ID to almost every
03:32 - element in HTML you can give an ID to
03:34 - images fields paragraph spans divs
03:38 - absolutely anything so if you're writing
03:41 - code inside this file inside any file in
03:44 - an external javascript file you can use
03:46 - this to reference each element so this
03:50 - is shown more commonly in an example
03:52 - such as an input button so let's go
03:55 - ahead and create a button again or for
03:59 - the first time so we created a text
04:00 - field before and I'm going to give this
04:02 - a value of click me I'm also going to
04:06 - give this an ID of click underscore me
04:10 - so now this is our reference point here
04:12 - and inside selectors we can actually use
04:15 - this to a to carry out a specific action
04:19 - when this particular button named click
04:22 - me has been
04:22 - clicked let's go to our browser and
04:24 - refresh just so we can see we've got the
04:26 - button here and when we click it for
04:28 - example we want to create an alert box
04:31 - for the user so we reference it by click
04:34 - me so inside of our code we can say hash
04:39 - click me dot click we're creating an
04:43 - event handler here so handling the event
04:46 - when it click me is has been clicked
04:49 - don't worry if you're not too sure about
04:51 - this just for now we then go ahead and
04:53 - create a function here with the
04:55 - parentheses the curly parentheses as
04:58 - well bring this down and then after here
05:00 - we can just write alert and hello so
05:04 - we've referenced this click Me button
05:05 - using a hash and then the click me it
05:08 - should be click underscore me text and
05:11 - then when we click we run this line here
05:14 - so we've referenced this button and
05:16 - we've added an event to it you'll notice
05:20 - that this automatically I eradicate the
05:23 - need for inline JavaScript as well
05:26 - we've created everything externally by
05:29 - attaching this event to this button here
05:31 - by referencing it let's go ahead and
05:33 - click that button and we get the hello
05:36 - dialogue box appear on our screen so
05:40 - that's essentially how we would
05:42 - reference we would use our jQuery
05:45 - selector to select an field or an
05:49 - element sorry by its ID
