00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:02 - slash on live camera for the New Boston
00:04 - and in this tutorial we're gonna be
00:06 - talking about the open folder dialog so
00:09 - just like the Open File dialog the open
00:11 - folder dialog opens up a window that
00:13 - lets you browse through the folders and
00:15 - select what you want but instead of
00:16 - selecting a file you're gonna select a
00:18 - folder which is let's say a folder to
00:21 - save something to if they're not saving
00:23 - a particular file at that moment so
00:27 - let's go ahead and create a new project
00:28 - and I'll show you how to use it so we'll
00:31 - select the windows forms application and
00:33 - we will call it folder dialog go ahead
00:37 - and click OK and wait for that to load
00:39 - ok so once it's loaded we'll resize the
00:42 - form some let's come into our tool box
00:45 - and we will add two buttons we got
00:51 - button 1 + button 2 now for button 1
00:54 - we're going to set the text to right
00:57 - file we will set it to button right and
01:02 - now for button 2 we want it to the name
01:05 - to be button folder and we want to set
01:10 - the text to change folder okay so now
01:17 - I'll come back over here to our tool box
01:19 - and we will add two text boxes so we've
01:23 - got text box 1 and text box 2 so text
01:27 - box 1 is going to be the title of our
01:29 - text file and the text box 2 is going to
01:34 - be the contents so we'll set the name of
01:37 - text box 1 to text title and for text
01:43 - box 2 we want text contents so now we're
01:49 - going to add a folder browser dialog so
01:54 - we'll go ahead and add that right in
01:56 - there and you can see it creates an
01:57 - object of it for us and we can change
01:59 - the name of this if we want so let's go
02:01 - ahead and double click on change folder
02:04 - and so now that we're in our code for
02:06 - form 1 what we need to do is let's just
02:10 - make a variable
02:13 - that can store the path of the selected
02:18 - path that they got from the folder
02:21 - browser dialog now you can access this
02:23 - directly from the folder browser dialog
02:25 - one but I like storing it in another
02:28 - variable
02:28 - it just makes it a little bit easier so
02:30 - we'll just type folder browser dialog
02:33 - one dot show dialog and after they've
02:38 - shown the dialog or once they click OK
02:41 - what we want to do is get what they
02:43 - selected so we'll do a string path it's
02:47 - going to be equal to folder browser
02:48 - dialog one dot and you can see here that
02:52 - we've got a whole bunch of stuff that we
02:53 - can use we just want to use selected
02:55 - path so now that we've got the path
02:59 - where they want to save their files
03:00 - let's go ahead and double click on write
03:02 - file and we will just write the files
03:05 - for them so we'll type system dot IO dot
03:10 - file so we're going to use the long
03:12 - version of this so that we don't have to
03:14 - import system dot IO and no one want to
03:16 - do is write all text now for our first
03:20 - first argument it's going to be the
03:22 - string so we're just going to use string
03:25 - path now we're going to have to specify
03:28 - the name of the file so we'll just add a
03:32 - backslash and now we'll add the title so
03:37 - text title dot text so what this is
03:43 - going to do is going to get the path
03:45 - that they selected add a backslash to
03:47 - just separated because everything is
03:50 - separated with the backslash folders and
03:52 - then if you select a file on that it's
03:53 - got the folder name backslash the file
03:55 - name and then we're gonna use the title
03:57 - of what they selected and then we're
03:59 - just going to add an extension to the
04:00 - file so we'll make it a dot txt file so
04:03 - now for the contents we're going to use
04:05 - text contents dot text so it's going to
04:09 - write all the text from this text box
04:11 - right here to the path that they
04:13 - selected from change folder and it's
04:15 - going to use the title that they used up
04:16 - here so let's run this and hopefully we
04:19 - won't get any errors now let's go ahead
04:22 - and change the folder I can see that
04:24 - this is a little bit different
04:25 - or a lot different than the save file
04:28 - dialog or the open file dialog but it
04:32 - works essentially the same way let's go
04:34 - ahead and open up computer will drop
04:37 - down
04:38 - Sam's extra external hard drive and
04:40 - we'll just go ahead and select that go
04:43 - ahead and click OK so now I'll type will
04:47 - title it apples will add some stuff in
04:50 - it so and now we'll just go ahead and
04:55 - write the file now we can also write
04:59 - this a couple more times
05:01 - so we'll just title it YouTube and then
05:04 - we can write the file again now I'm
05:06 - putting come in here into my computer we
05:08 - can open up my external hard drive and
05:10 - you can see that we got YouTube and
05:12 - apples and this is my file from a while
05:15 - ago we can just delete that and if we
05:17 - open up apples you can see that we get
05:20 - nvidia intel and AMD the stuff that we
05:23 - added it'll be open up YouTube we also
05:25 - need the same thing because we left it
05:27 - the same inside the text box so go ahead
05:32 - and practice a little bit with open
05:33 - folder dialogues and once you got
05:36 - familiar with them and you're not going
05:37 - to forget how to use them go ahead and
05:39 - move on to the next tutorial
