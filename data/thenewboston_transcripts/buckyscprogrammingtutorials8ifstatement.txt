00:00 - what is up guys is bucking welcome to
00:01 - your eighth C++ tutorial and in this
00:03 - story I want to talk to you guys about
00:05 - something called the if statement now
00:07 - the if statement is a way where we can
00:10 - have our program make very basic
00:12 - decisions what we're going to be doing
00:14 - is we're going to be giving our computer
00:17 - program a test and it's going to run
00:19 - that test if the test is true then it's
00:22 - going to run a certain bit of code if
00:23 - the test is false
00:25 - then it's not going to run any bit of
00:27 - code so depending on that test depends
00:29 - whether we run coda or not so it sounds
00:32 - confusing but it's actually incredibly
00:33 - simple so let me go ahead and I'll show
00:36 - you the syntax for if statement right
00:37 - now the syntax to make an if statement
00:40 - is I F you just go ahead and type the
00:43 - word F and then go ahead and add
00:45 - parenthesis now inside our parentheses
00:47 - is where we're going to be making our
00:49 - test now after those parentheses go
00:51 - ahead and add curly braces now this is
00:54 - called the body of the if statement and
00:56 - now here is where we write the code to
00:58 - run if the test is true so let's go
01:01 - ahead and make a simple bit of code
01:03 - let's go ahead and just write like C out
01:06 - armed lucky is awesome
01:10 - so if our test is true it's going to
01:12 - print out Bucky is awesome on the screen
01:14 - if the test is false it's not going to
01:16 - print out anything so let's go ahead and
01:18 - let me talk to you guys about the
01:20 - different types of tests the first test
01:23 - I want to show you guys is the greater
01:25 - than test and this simply tests if one
01:28 - value is greater than another value so
01:30 - if v is greater than three go ahead and
01:34 - run this code so 5 is indeed greater
01:37 - than 3 so this is true so whenever we
01:40 - build and run this it's going to say
01:41 - Bucky is awesome pretty cool huh
01:44 - so now let's go ahead and make something
01:47 - like umm is 1 greater than 3 so it's
01:51 - going to test this is 1 greater than 3
01:53 - well this is actually false 1 is less
01:56 - than 3 so it's not going to run this bit
01:58 - of code
01:58 - so go ahead build and run this and as
02:00 - you can see it did not print out Bucky
02:03 - is awesome on the screen how sad so of
02:06 - course we have the greater than test we
02:08 - obviously have the less than test
02:10 - one lesson three well now this is going
02:13 - to be true so it's going to print out
02:14 - Bucky is awesome on the screen so let's
02:16 - go ahead and run this and indeed it
02:18 - prints out Bucky is awesome
02:20 - so aside from greater than and less than
02:23 - we also have these two tests greater
02:27 - than or equals two so whenever we tested
02:31 - whether three is greater than three this
02:34 - test is going to be false because three
02:36 - is not greater than three three is
02:38 - actually equal to three well if we want
02:40 - to test if three is greater than or
02:42 - equal to three we use greater than with
02:45 - the equal sign after it so now whenever
02:47 - you run it is three greater than or
02:50 - equal to three yes three is equal to
02:52 - three so print it out Bucky is awesome
02:55 - so aside from that we also have the less
02:57 - than or equal to so if you know is one
03:00 - less than or equal to three
03:02 - yes one is less than three so it's going
03:05 - to print out Bucky is awesome so again
03:07 - what I want to show you guys is that you
03:10 - have greater than less than greater than
03:12 - or equals two and less than or equals
03:15 - two so now those are called the
03:17 - relational operators we also have two
03:20 - more tests that we can do and these are
03:22 - called the Equality operators this is a
03:25 - really simple test it tests whether one
03:27 - value is equal to another value or if
03:30 - one value is not equal to another value
03:32 - so in order to do this go ahead and
03:35 - write is three equal to equal to three
03:39 - and you might be thinking all right why
03:41 - don't I just use one equal sign why
03:43 - didn't they make it that way
03:44 - well whenever we were creating variables
03:46 - such as like int x equals eight the one
03:50 - equal sign the single equal sign is
03:52 - assigned for creating variables and
03:54 - assigning values so that's why I decided
03:56 - that two equal signs was sufficient for
03:59 - testing so remember a common mistake is
04:02 - to put one equal sign in there and
04:04 - you're going to get an error or
04:05 - something terrible is going to happen so
04:06 - whenever you're testing you need two
04:08 - equal signs so let's go ahead and run
04:11 - this test is three equal to three well
04:13 - yes it is so it's going to print out
04:15 - Bucky is awesome I'll give it another
04:17 - test like is seven equal to three well
04:20 - no it's not so it's not going to print
04:22 - out buck
04:23 - is awesome so that is one test is called
04:25 - the equal sign equal sign or equal to
04:27 - test and there's one more test I want to
04:32 - go over and that's explanation point
04:34 - equal sign and this is the key word for
04:36 - not equals to so is 8 not equal to or in
04:40 - other words is 8 different than 8 well
04:43 - no it's the same so it's not going to
04:45 - print out everything is 10 different
04:49 - than 8 well yes it is so that's going to
04:51 - be true and it's going to print out
04:52 - Bucky is awesome so that is all the
04:55 - tests that I have for you guys and
04:56 - that's all the tests in C++ again to
04:59 - recap one last time greater than less
05:02 - than greater than or equal to less than
05:05 - or equal to equal and not equal so now
05:10 - that we know all those tests I probably
05:13 - should tell you guys this people
05:15 - typically don't in by people I mean
05:17 - computer programmers computer
05:18 - programmers typically don't just test
05:20 - two numbers against each other they
05:22 - usually have variables that they test
05:25 - against each other like int a equals 98
05:27 - int B equals 76 and then they test
05:32 - something like is a arm greater than B
05:36 - well if we go ahead and run this 98 is
05:39 - indeed greater than 76 so of course
05:43 - that's true it's going to print out
05:44 - Bucky is awesome and aside from that you
05:47 - either have two variables to test or you
05:49 - have a variable and a value like is 98
05:53 - greater than 5 something like that we
05:56 - can actually mix variables with values
05:58 - and that would be true as well so again
06:00 - you can either have two values in here
06:02 - two variables or variable on one side
06:05 - and value on another side pretty cool
06:07 - huh
06:07 - so that's the basics of again relational
06:11 - operators are the greater than and less
06:13 - than one and equality operators are the
06:16 - equals equals in explanation point
06:18 - equals so now that we know how to make a
06:22 - basic if statement again to recap one
06:24 - last time if your test and then the body
06:27 - and it's going to run the test and if
06:29 - that code is true is going to run the
06:31 - body that's the basics of a if statement
06:33 - now that we understand that we can begin
06:35 - enhancing our program
06:37 - a little bit more so in our next
06:39 - tutorial what I'm going to be doing is
06:41 - I'm going to be having the user enter
06:44 - two numbers and we are going to be
06:46 - comparing those numbers and depending on
06:48 - what numbers they entered run a certain
06:50 - bit of code so now as you can see we're
06:53 - just building and building to our
06:55 - knowledge of C++ to make better and
06:57 - better programs so don't skip over if
07:00 - statements because it's a huge part of
07:02 - C++ so for now that's all I have for you
07:04 - guys so thank you guys for watching in
07:06 - the next tutorial
07:07 - we're going to be building that
07:08 - calculator thingy so it's going to be
07:10 - awesome so thank you guys for watching
