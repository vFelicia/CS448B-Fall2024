00:01 - all right guys welcome to your 60th udk
00:03 - tutorial and in this lesson I'm going to
00:05 - finish covering the rest of the Mata
00:07 - interface so now that we covered the
00:10 - toolbar or basically there are a couple
00:11 - buttons that we forgot to cover but I'm
00:13 - actually going to be saving those for
00:14 - later let's go ahead and cover these
00:16 - tabs right here so what these Tabs are
00:20 - they're basically a better way of
00:22 - organizing your tracks so some
00:24 - animations you're going to have a bunch
00:26 - of tracks like a movement track and let
00:28 - me go ahead and add another you know
00:30 - event track or something so what these
00:33 - do is they organize your tracks so any
00:35 - camera tracks would go in here any
00:37 - skeletal message tracks would go in here
00:39 - since we added that one event track
00:41 - whenever we click our event tab then
00:43 - that event track would go right there
00:46 - but you usually just want to work with
00:47 - all so whenever you're working under the
00:50 - all tab you can see all your tracks so
00:52 - now let me go ahead and delete that
00:54 - event track for now because we don't
00:55 - need it and the next thing I want to go
00:58 - over is this what I've been talking
01:00 - about all along and that's the time
01:02 - slider so remember I told you guys that
01:05 - you basically were going to have an
01:06 - animation made up of key frames give it
01:09 - a starting point and an ending point in
01:12 - this case scenario well what the time
01:14 - slider does is it basically you can
01:17 - slide it to somewhere in between to
01:20 - basically give you the current time of
01:22 - that animation again if you just
01:24 - visually look what's going on you can
01:26 - see a lot better than I explain it so
01:29 - again this pretty obvious what that is
01:32 - now this thing with the green triangles
01:35 - and I got an idea that this was
01:36 - bothering you because you guys probably
01:38 - couldn't figure out what this was
01:40 - because whenever we scrolled over it
01:42 - nothing really happens this and this
01:44 - button right here kind of go hand in
01:46 - hand this green shaded area controls the
01:50 - loop preview playback and what I mean by
01:53 - that is you can select a special area
01:56 - with this green and if you hit the loop
01:58 - section Plus playback it only plays that
02:02 - section of your animation so you guys
02:05 - can see what's going on right here so if
02:07 - you have a long animation and you have a
02:10 - little piece that's going wrong and it's
02:12 - kind of bothering you and you just want
02:14 - to focus on that then this is where you
02:16 - can you know maybe you want to make a
02:18 - loop of something and play back it's
02:19 - pretty obvious to see what's going on so
02:22 - now let me go ahead and scroll that out
02:24 - of the way because if you're not using
02:25 - it I like to move it to be the to the
02:28 - what to the beginning nice little wrap
02:31 - there or it uh it kind of bothers me so
02:34 - that's what that does so now I'll talk
02:37 - to you guys about this red triangle I
02:38 - touched on that a little bit before but
02:40 - this red triangle at the bottom controls
02:42 - the entire length of your animation so
02:45 - typically you want to have an animation
02:47 - that starts you know at the beginning
02:49 - and it ends you know after 3 seconds or
02:52 - something but then you can have your
02:54 - entire movie play for longer so say you
02:58 - wanted to I don't know do something like
03:01 - this you wanted to have your door move
03:03 - from zero to 3 seconds but after 5
03:07 - seconds or 4 seconds you wanted an
03:11 - announcement to play so you would have
03:12 - your entire movie 4 seconds long and
03:15 - then you would have an announcement
03:17 - coming off this completed thing so I
03:19 - just want to tell you guys that you can
03:21 - have an animation within a movie so you
03:25 - guys might think that this is just
03:26 - wasted space but it's there's actually
03:29 - kind of a AR to you know deciding the
03:31 - time of your animation using your key
03:33 - frames and also the overall length of
03:37 - your movie so I'm going to go ahead and
03:38 - move that to 4.5 because why the heck
03:41 - not and the last thing I want to touch
03:44 - on is these key frames I told you guys
03:46 - about them before but the key frames are
03:48 - basically just points and time or
03:50 - checkpoints where you want things to
03:52 - occur so at the beginning at my z00 key
03:56 - frame I want the door to be right there
03:58 - and now at my what time is this 266 key
04:02 - frame I want my key frame or excuse me I
04:04 - want my door to be on bottom so in
04:06 - between your key frames the udk is
04:08 - automatically going to fill in and
04:10 - here's a nice little tip if you go ahead
04:12 - and hold control and try to move a key
04:14 - frame it moves that key frame to you
04:17 - know whatever time you want however say
04:19 - I was trying to move this to 3 seconds
04:22 - and you know maybe I don't know I'm
04:24 - nervous because I'm just getting married
04:26 - and I can't quite get it on 3 seconds if
04:29 - he go ahead and right click a key frame
04:31 - you can go ahead and set that time to
04:34 - 3.0 and it's going to do all the dirty
04:36 - work for you it's going to hop that
04:38 - right to 3.0 so that's a nice little
04:40 - trick whenever you're trying to position
04:42 - key frames exactly how you want them so
04:44 - then I can go ahead and you
04:46 - know position that right there and now
04:50 - my entire animation kind of plays
04:52 - exactly how I wanted to pretty cool huh
04:55 - so aside from that I guess I'll talk to
04:58 - you guys about the individual tracks now
05:00 - now I remember that I told you guys that
05:03 - you can have groups and if you
05:05 - rightclick a group you can add
05:07 - individual tracks now a track is
05:10 - basically saying what do you want to
05:12 - animate in the udk so you can animate
05:15 - things other than just things moving
05:17 - around you can animate um I guess I'll
05:19 - go through a couple of these things well
05:21 - let me go ahead and well I guess I might
05:23 - as well just test this out a boing don't
05:25 - worry about that it's kind of confusing
05:27 - uh a new event track is one that going
05:29 - to actually be using quite often what a
05:32 - new event track does is it basically if
05:36 - you go ahead and select that track and
05:38 - move your current time indicator to like
05:40 - one and a half seconds and add a key
05:43 - frame and you're going to want to go
05:45 - ahead and name this event like
05:47 - um
05:49 - play announcement and make sure you
05:51 - spell it wrong and hopefully I did and
05:54 - now whenever your animation's playing go
05:57 - ahead and look in Kismet right now
05:59 - whenever ever your user triggers that
06:01 - trigger and plays this animation it's
06:03 - going to play and as soon as it hits
06:06 - that one and a half second Mark then
06:09 - this play announcement event is going to
06:11 - fire so this can kick off an
06:13 - announcement and you might want to add
06:14 - you know a new action um an announcement
06:17 - right there to play an announcement so
06:19 - basically an event track is a key frame
06:24 - where it triggers an event to happen at
06:26 - that point in time so now let me go
06:28 - ahead and delete that and when I delete
06:30 - this look over in Kismet that event
06:33 - disappeared as well so I guess I can go
06:36 - ahead and delete that clean up
06:38 - purposes and I'll just go over a couple
06:41 - more of these real quick to show you
06:42 - guys the different things that can be
06:43 - animated um Face Effects is for whenever
06:46 - you're making like a animation and you
06:49 - want their face to move then there you
06:51 - go animation control is for skeletal
06:53 - meshes and like character movement um
06:56 - particles whenever we deal with particle
06:58 - systems uh float properties has again to
07:01 - deal with kind of like certain actors
07:03 - and objects have a float property and
07:07 - let's see what Moro has to deal with
07:09 - skeletal meshes and character movement
07:12 - and again all of these things I just
07:14 - want to demonstrate a few of them to
07:16 - tell you guys you can animate things
07:18 - other than just moving crap around on
07:21 - your screen so you can basically animate
07:23 - anything that you can pop into your mind
07:26 - so with that being said that basically
07:28 - covers everything I needed to cover
07:30 - again there's this property section down
07:32 - here but with all my tutorials I'm just
07:35 - going to be going over the properties as
07:36 - we need them so I won't really worry
07:38 - about that right now the two other
07:40 - things I want to go over that kind of
07:42 - don't fit into this interface at all but
07:44 - I need to tell you guys is whenever
07:46 - you're working and you want to alter a
07:47 - key frame you may have a little trouble
07:50 - and that's because you don't have a key
07:52 - frame selected whenever you have a key
07:54 - frame selected a couple things are going
07:55 - to happen it's going to say the name of
07:58 - the key right there there and it's also
08:00 - going to say adjust key whatever the key
08:04 - number is in your perspective view so if
08:06 - you're trying to edit a key frame make
08:08 - sure you are on that key because some
08:11 - people get off a little bit like right
08:14 - there and they try to move this
08:17 - around and it doesn't work and the
08:19 - reason is because they're not on the key
08:21 - so I want to give you guys that nice
08:23 - little tip before you run into that
08:24 - problem and the last thing I want to
08:26 - tell you guys is this by by default
08:30 - whenever you add an interp actor the
08:33 - Collision is off so let me go ahead and
08:36 - show you guys what happens when I run
08:37 - through this door I'm going to go ahead
08:40 - and my character can run right through
08:42 - that door so what the heck so you
08:45 - obviously want to change this like if
08:48 - you have a door or something and you
08:49 - don't want your character to run through
08:51 - it so like I said by default the
08:54 - properties of an interb actor has no
08:58 - Collision so if you make a door or roof
09:01 - or you know anything that you want your
09:03 - user to bump into go ahead and hit F4
09:06 - and under Collision let's see if I can
09:08 - find it again Collision type no Collide
09:10 - that means your player can run through
09:12 - it shoot through it they can drive
09:14 - through it and if we have a door we're
09:17 - just going to want to hit block all that
09:18 - means that our user can't run through it
09:21 - and it basically acts like a big chunk
09:22 - of wood that now they can shoot it and
09:24 - bump into it with cars and stuff like
09:26 - that so I just want to tell you guys
09:28 - those couple things because I get those
09:31 - questions a lot on my Forum so I thought
09:33 - I'd cover them right now again they
09:35 - didn't really fit into this tutorial but
09:37 - might as well get that out of the way so
09:39 - that's all I have for you guys in this
09:40 - tutorial so thank you guys for watching
09:42 - don't forget to subscribe and uh yeah
09:44 - I'll see you next time
