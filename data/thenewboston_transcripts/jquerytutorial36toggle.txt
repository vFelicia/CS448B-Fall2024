00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg
00:03 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this tutorial we're going to look at
00:08 - jquery toggle and actually toggling and
00:12 - we're going to be performing an action
00:15 - depending on when the button is clicked
00:18 - so for example we're going to use a link
00:21 - now let's go ahead and create a link in
00:24 - our markup and i'm going to write in
00:26 - here press me or click me would be more
00:31 - appropriate okay so inside the href we
00:35 - need a hash and we want to create an ID
00:38 - and i'm just going to call this click me
00:40 - now what we're trying to achieve is when
00:42 - we click this the first time we click it
00:45 - we are going to do something and this
00:48 - second time we click it we're going to
00:50 - do something else so let's go to our
00:54 - browser and preview this and you'll see
00:56 - that we just have a link click me when
00:58 - we click at the moment it does nothing
01:00 - so we need to create a handler that
01:02 - checks when first of all this is clicked
01:05 - oh in fact no we can just use the toggle
01:09 - so when this is clicked we can append
01:11 - the event handler toggle and this will
01:15 - do two things the first thing that we'll
01:17 - do is show us something the second time
01:20 - it will revert back or will show us
01:22 - something else then it will revert back
01:24 - to the first option so let's go ahead
01:27 - and create a div underneath here and we
01:30 - can give that an ID of click event so
01:38 - once this is clicked we need to show an
01:41 - event and then another one and then
01:42 - revert back to the first one and the
01:44 - toggle function actually allows you to
01:47 - show and hide elements for example
01:51 - simultaneously so you can use the same
01:54 - button however in this tutorial we're
01:56 - just looking at the event so this will
01:58 - show you how it works and then later on
02:00 - we can use toggle to actually hide and
02:02 - show things in a preview in a later
02:04 - tutorial so now we want to go ahead and
02:07 - create a new javascript file and this is
02:10 - going to be called toggle j/s
02:13 - and we want to include that in our page
02:15 - as well so you just copy and paste this
02:18 - down here and change this to toggle
02:21 - Jeff's okay so we want to add an toggle
02:25 - event handler to this click me so let's
02:27 - go ahead and type a dollar in
02:29 - parentheses we need to reference it
02:31 - which is click underscore me then we say
02:34 - dot toggle now this time we're going to
02:36 - be creating two functions inside here as
02:39 - opposed to one as we've seen in previous
02:41 - tutorials so we want to first of all
02:44 - create a function here with the block
02:46 - and then we want to create another
02:48 - function here with another block so
02:51 - let's just go ahead and pull this down
02:53 - and the same with this one so we can
02:56 - work in a in two different areas so
02:59 - we've got here and here okay so the
03:03 - first time we want to click the button
03:04 - or we click the link we want to display
03:07 - something so we need to reference our
03:09 - click event div and we're going to play
03:12 - some text inside of here so let's go
03:15 - ahead and say click see what I called it
03:21 - event click event dot HTML which is
03:25 - going to place some text inside of this
03:27 - div let's just say yes and then we can
03:34 - go down here and choose to do the same
03:36 - thing so click event and dot HTML no so
03:45 - now what's going to happen is when we
03:47 - click on the link here we're going to
03:51 - use the toggle to first of all display
03:53 - yes in this click event div then we're
03:56 - going to display no the second time the
03:59 - user clicks on it what will happen is
04:01 - when they click on it again it will then
04:04 - display yes again now you may be
04:07 - wondering what use this might have well
04:10 - if you had two different options for
04:11 - example you wanted to say I've no
04:16 - display link to say do you like jQuery
04:20 - and the you want to give the user the
04:23 - option to click it and change the value
04:25 - I mean
04:26 - so that's an audit example but hopefully
04:29 - through this tutorial you'll see the
04:30 - functionality of it so now that we've
04:33 - got click me when we click it once you
04:35 - can see that we've displayed yes as
04:36 - we've seen in our code when we click it
04:39 - again this now changes to no so you can
04:43 - now see that when we click it a third
04:45 - time it changes back to yes so
04:48 - essentially what we're doing is we're
04:50 - checking for the click of this but we're
04:52 - toggling so we're toggling between yes
04:54 - and no so hopefully now you can see the
04:57 - advantage of being able to use this and
04:59 - use it easily being able to change an
05:02 - option for example this could for
05:05 - example be an option that the user might
05:09 - want to change within a settings area on
05:12 - a web site it could have it has a
05:14 - variety of uses and a wide variety of
05:17 - uses at that so I'll leave it up to you
05:20 - with as how you use this and how you
05:23 - interpret the uses it can have however
05:27 - for now that is the toggle event handler
05:29 - in jQuery
