00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:02 - and this is a video tutorial for the new
00:04 - Boston in this video we're going to look
00:07 - at creating an example application
00:09 - that's going to reference the paragraph
00:12 - using a selector or some paragraphs on a
00:15 - page using a select using selectors in
00:17 - jQuery so essentially what we're going
00:20 - to be creating is an application that
00:22 - allows you to increase the text size on
00:25 - a page between paragraph tags so the
00:29 - first thing we're going to do is set up
00:30 - our page so we know exactly how it looks
00:32 - so let's first of all go ahead and
00:35 - create our paragraphs I'm going to
00:37 - create a paragraph here and that's going
00:39 - to have some text inside of it so this
00:41 - is some text I'm then going to create
00:44 - another paragraph just below this this
00:47 - is some more text so now just up here we
00:54 - want to create some links that are going
00:55 - to allow us to click smaller or bigger
00:57 - in order to increase or decrease the
00:59 - font size of this text so let's go ahead
01:02 - and create our links so this one is
01:06 - going to be well we'll put a label here
01:08 - so font size this one is going to be
01:11 - smaller and this one here is going to be
01:17 - bigger so the link is going to be hash
01:21 - because we're not actually linking to a
01:23 - page we're using jQuery to handle when
01:25 - we click on these links but we're going
01:27 - to give each one an ID so the first
01:30 - one's going to be smaller and this one
01:34 - is going to be bigger so now what we can
01:38 - do is we can create event handlers for
01:40 - each of these links and then actually
01:43 - perform an operation on the paragraphs
01:45 - on the page I increase their size using
01:48 - the bigger link or decrease their size
01:50 - using the smaller link let's just go
01:53 - over to our browser and take a look at
01:54 - our page so this is how it looks at the
01:57 - moment we've got a smaller link and a
01:59 - bigger link which we can click on and
02:01 - then once we finish the tutorial and
02:04 - actually created the jQuery
02:06 - functionality these paragraphs will
02:08 - increase now we're kind of taking the
02:10 - long way round however the reason I'm
02:12 - doing there
02:13 - is to demonstrate the use of selectors
02:16 - and just to make things a bit easier to
02:19 - understand so we've included selectors
02:22 - jjs inside of our page as well as jQuery
02:26 - j/s and we have selectors j/s here open
02:29 - in our text editor ready to start
02:31 - editing so the first thing we want to do
02:33 - is create event handlers for both these
02:35 - links so we're going to use a selector
02:38 - to reference the smaller link and then
02:42 - when this is clicked we want to run a
02:44 - function so we create our function
02:48 - definition and then between these
02:50 - paragraphs hit our these curly braces
02:54 - here we are going to perform a function
02:57 - and this function is going to be change
02:59 - underscore size we're going to go ahead
03:02 - and look at the parameters in a minute
03:03 - when we've done the same for bigger and
03:06 - then we'll be you know feeding in the
03:08 - parameters and and looking at creating
03:12 - the actual function itself so the next
03:15 - is a hash bigger and we want to again
03:20 - create the same on the same click event
03:23 - handler and again we want to outline a
03:26 - function here and between these brackets
03:28 - we want to run the same function now the
03:32 - parameters that we're going to feed here
03:33 - is which element we want to be made
03:36 - bigger now for example we could choose
03:39 - the element or an asterisks or for all
03:44 - elements on the page or we could just
03:47 - choose a specific element and in this
03:50 - case we're just going to choose a
03:51 - specific element so the element that we
03:54 - want to feed in is P and the next
03:58 - parameter will just be smaller so what's
04:02 - going to happen in this change size
04:03 - function we're going to change all of
04:05 - the elements that correspond to this
04:06 - selector to a smaller font size and
04:09 - we're going to use an if statement to
04:11 - check this value inside of this change
04:13 - size function so we'll do that
04:16 - the same for this one we'll select all
04:18 - paragraphs and we want to make them
04:20 - bigger
04:22 - okay so let's go up and start to define
04:24 - our function and the parameters that we
04:27 - need to feed in and then we'll create
04:29 - the rest of the function so the function
04:32 - is called change underscore size we'll
04:36 - create our block and then we'll fill in
04:37 - the parameters that we need to feed in
04:39 - so the first is the element that we want
04:41 - to change or the element set that we
04:44 - want to change and the second parameter
04:45 - is the size so this element here
04:48 - corresponds to the P and this size here
04:51 - corresponds to this textual
04:52 - representation of where we want the size
04:55 - to go do we want to increase it or
04:56 - decrease it
04:58 - okay so inside of our function we need
05:01 - to grab the current size of the text
05:03 - inside of these paragraphs so there'll
05:06 - be a default text size for these
05:08 - paragraphs which we can retrieve so I'm
05:11 - going to create a variable called
05:12 - current and that's going to be equal to
05:18 - element CSS
