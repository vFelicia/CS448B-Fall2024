00:00 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com
00:02 - slash on live gamer for the new boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're gonna be
00:06 - talking more about dates now if you
00:08 - remember in the previous tutorial we
00:10 - created a date object and set it equal
00:12 - to the current date and then we just
00:15 - went ahead and showed that in the
00:17 - message box now what we can do is we can
00:20 - extract certain parts of the dates so we
00:23 - can get the month the day of the year
00:25 - hours minutes seconds the day of the
00:27 - week or the day of the years and all of
00:30 - these are available to us inside of the
00:33 - date class so let's go ahead and show
00:36 - some of these so we'll type message box
00:38 - not show and we'll show the month and we
00:43 - go ahead go ahead and add current date
00:47 - dot month and we'll just create a couple
00:53 - more of these
00:54 - and we will show the various parts of
00:57 - the date so we'll just do year
01:07 - now you can see that these don't have
01:10 - the little purple boxes here they have a
01:13 - little box here with a finger pointing
01:15 - at it and what that means is that it's a
01:19 - property or a variable so this isn't a
01:22 - method or this isn't a function like the
01:26 - two string or too short date string this
01:29 - just gets values from the object that
01:33 - we've created so let's go ahead and show
01:36 - some more stuff here so we can show the
01:39 - day which will show the the current day
01:48 - of the month
01:53 - now we can get the hour and the minute
01:55 - and the second so let's go ahead and
01:57 - type that so we'll type our and then we
02:03 - will add current date dot our and now
02:09 - what we can do is we can add what's
02:12 - called environment dot new line now I
02:17 - may have talked about this in a previous
02:19 - tutorial but what this does is it takes
02:22 - this string right here and then when we
02:24 - add environment dot new line it'll go
02:26 - down the line for us
02:29 - now let's go ahead and add some more
02:32 - stuff so we'll add will do hours minutes
02:35 - and seconds so minute and we'll go ahead
02:41 - and add current date dot minute and then
02:48 - we'll do seconds too so environment dot
02:52 - new line and we'll go ahead and add
02:56 - seconds
03:02 - current date dot second okay so let's go
03:07 - ahead and fix this right here we do not
03:09 - need these parameters now what we can do
03:12 - is we showed the month year the day the
03:16 - hours the minutes and the seconds now we
03:18 - can get the day of the week in the day
03:21 - of the year which is of type integer so
03:24 - the day of the week is either gonna be 1
03:25 - through 7 and the day of the year is
03:27 - going to be either 1 through 365 or 366
03:32 - for a leap year so we could type message
03:35 - box not show day of week and we'll go
03:42 - ahead and add current date dot day of
03:48 - week now we will show the day of the
03:53 - year so message box not show day of year
03:57 - and we will add current date dot day of
04:02 - year ok so now what we can do is we can
04:07 - run our program and we it will get all
04:10 - of these time values so here we have our
04:14 - long time value which shows the the
04:17 - month the day of the month the year
04:19 - hours minutes seconds and p.m. or a.m.
04:22 - then we get month 5 so it is the fifth
04:26 - month of the year which is May year 2011
04:30 - which is of course the year we get the
04:34 - day which is May 9 we get our 19 and
04:39 - this goes by the 24 hour time period so
04:43 - our 19 would be 7 minute is 29 minutes
04:47 - and second is 18 seconds so 7 29 18
04:51 - seconds it is the first day of the week
04:54 - because it is Monday and the day of the
04:57 - weeks start from Monday in visual visual
05:01 - basic they do not start from Sunday and
05:04 - then the day of the year is 129 so I'm
05:08 - go ahead and put this code in if you are
05:10 - already have it and once you've used
05:14 - some day functions gets
05:15 - values from your date objects and you're
05:18 - familiar with that go ahead and move on
05:19 - to the next tutorial and thanks for
05:21 - watching
