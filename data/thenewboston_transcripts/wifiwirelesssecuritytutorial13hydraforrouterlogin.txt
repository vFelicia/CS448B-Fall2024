00:00 - all right guys welcome back and in this
00:02 - video I am going to show you how to use
00:03 - a tool called Hydra to access a router's
00:07 - settings or configuration screen
00:09 - whatever you want to call it so as I'm
00:11 - sure you guys know whenever you go to
00:14 - the IP address of a default gateway or
00:16 - maybe a variation of it what it does is
00:19 - it gives you this web page where you can
00:21 - access your router settings and you can
00:23 - change things like the default DNS
00:25 - server uh this is where you set the
00:27 - pre-shared key or password for your
00:28 - Wi-Fi network basically any settings
00:31 - that you can perform on your router this
00:33 - is how you get to it so if you click
00:36 - login or maybe the forms right here then
00:39 - what it has you do is it has you type
00:41 - the username and the password now most
00:44 - of the time what you need to do and this
00:47 - is incredibly easy if you just look at
00:50 - the manufacturer of your router and
00:52 - maybe the model number let me just close
00:54 - out here then all you have to do is you
00:56 - have to go to Google and say okay what
00:58 - is the default user username and
01:00 - password and it's usually something
01:01 - really easy like user user blank
01:05 - password uh admin admin you know
01:07 - something really simple like that so if
01:09 - you ever get to one of those screens
01:11 - first just Google it and see what the
01:12 - default uh you know credentials are now
01:15 - if you were smart and you actually
01:18 - change your password like I recommend
01:20 - most people do then maybe a few months
01:22 - later you came back and you're like all
01:24 - right I want to change I don't know
01:25 - maybe my Wi-Fi password but I can't
01:28 - remember my password
01:30 - that uh you know I changed my router to
01:32 - well what you can do is you can use a
01:34 - tool called Hydra and this allows you to
01:36 - perform a dictionary TCH on your router
01:39 - and I guess it isn't really a tech it's
01:41 - more of a recovery tool since it's your
01:43 - own router but I'll show you guys what
01:45 - we're going to do so and by the way I
01:49 - know that my router before this tutorial
01:51 - I already changed it back to default
01:53 - which is the username is user and the um
01:57 - the password is also user so just just
02:00 - remember that is user user to log in but
02:02 - we'll do it the cool
02:03 - way all right so before you start doing
02:07 - this you're going to need to have two
02:09 - files the first one is for potential
02:12 - usernames and the second one is going to
02:13 - be for potential passwords and they're
02:16 - usually going to be a lot longer than
02:17 - this but this is just an
02:19 - example so what it's going to do is this
02:21 - tool is going to go through every
02:22 - username and for each one it's going to
02:25 - try all of these passwords so root with
02:27 - this password then root with this
02:29 - password
02:30 - then if it can't hit any it's going to
02:31 - go to admin admin with this then this
02:33 - then this all the way down here and it's
02:35 - basically going to go through every
02:36 - combination until you find the one that
02:39 - works so let's close out of here and
02:43 - I'll show you guys how to use it so if
02:46 - you just type Hydra then after this you
02:49 - need to give it the page where it's
02:52 - going to log in and I closed out of my
02:54 - browser but mine was login. HTML so if
02:58 - you go to http that was the protocol and
03:01 - if you just type in the IP like you
03:03 - would in a browser it gets um a little
03:05 - confused so you need to surround it with
03:07 - square brackets so
03:11 - 192.168.0.1 and this isn't the same IP
03:14 - for every um single router the IP of
03:17 - your router depends on the manufacturer
03:19 - how your network set up but for mine and
03:23 - a lot of people's it's going to be this
03:24 - one or maybe uh 16811 so just look for
03:28 - your own you you know there's a bunch of
03:31 - different
03:32 - variations so my login page is login.
03:36 - HTML so this is pretty much the page
03:39 - where we have to type the username and
03:41 - password so after this I'm just going to
03:43 - show you guys a bunch of different um
03:45 - parameters that you guys can use these
03:47 - are uh very helpful and I almost do them
03:49 - all the time maybe I should just type
03:52 - all of these first
03:54 - so V then minus t we'll do a four and
03:59 - that's good for right now all right so
04:01 - this minus NS right here this means that
04:05 - I'll show you guys let me bring that
04:07 - back
04:08 - up usernames and passwords so you know
04:11 - how I said that what this is going to do
04:13 - is it's going to look at every username
04:15 - and try every password for it well
04:18 - whenever you have the ens flag it's not
04:20 - only going to do that but it's also
04:22 - going to try um so for this one the
04:25 - password of root so it tries itself as a
04:29 - password too
04:30 - and also a blank password so this one is
04:33 - going to try all these combinations plus
04:35 - root plus blank for the password this
04:37 - one is going to try all combinations
04:39 - plus admin plus blank forv password so
04:41 - it just gives you some more um options
04:44 - and by the way like even my router the
04:47 - username and password are both the same
04:49 - user user and I see admin admin a lot so
04:53 - this flag is actually really helpful
04:55 - minus F this means exit whenever we find
04:59 - a login so as soon as we find the
05:02 - credentials that we can that match that
05:04 - we can use then this stops the program
05:07 - and it doesn't you know no use
05:08 - continuing with the rest we already
05:10 - found what we were looking for this
05:12 - minus V just says to display the results
05:15 - in the terminal for
05:17 - both give me something to look at this
05:19 - minus T4 this says that this is the
05:22 - number of tests that we're going to run
05:24 - in parallel now you just don't want to
05:26 - do like a 100 because some routers won't
05:28 - allow it and even if they do you know
05:31 - then it could probably crash it so
05:33 - usually minus T4 8 or 16 are your
05:36 - options there and the last thing that it
05:38 - needs is just the files for the username
05:42 - and the password now if you're using a
05:45 - list then you use a capital letter if
05:47 - you're using just one then you use a
05:49 - lowercase letter so let's say that I
05:52 - just had one usern name I knew that the
05:54 - username was admin I'm going to do
05:56 - lowercase L admin now since I have a
06:00 - list then I use uppercase so that's the
06:04 - difference between those two and mine is
06:05 - on desktop and what was it top usernames
06:09 - so top 10 usernames do text and well
06:12 - it'll wrap so all right so the last
06:15 - thing is of course the passwords and
06:17 - same thing for password so if you know
06:19 - the password is like bacon 123 then you
06:22 - can just use a lowercase p but I'm just
06:25 - using a list of passwords so I'm going
06:27 - to use uppercase p and and then that's
06:31 - on the desktop too and that is top 10
06:36 - passwords do text so there you go and
06:39 - well now it's good to go I'm going to
06:41 - hit enter and check it out look how fast
06:44 - that was so it ran through all of the
06:48 - root so as you can see it did a root
06:51 - first and then blank and then it went
06:52 - through the list 1 2 3 4 5 6 it did it
06:55 - for admin that didn't work and then it
06:57 - did it for user and once it got to the
07:00 - login user using the password user it
07:04 - says D we finished we found a valid pair
07:08 - this is a username and password
07:11 - combination for your router so now we
07:14 - can log back into our router and do
07:16 - whatever we want to do to it change the
07:18 - password DNS settings uh you know maybe
07:21 - put some firewalls up whatever you want
07:23 - to do follow your heart but there you go
07:26 - that is the basics of Hydra and I
07:29 - actually want to do like a little
07:30 - miniseries on Hydra because there are a
07:32 - lot of different
07:33 - options and you know just different
07:36 - settings you can use you can do this for
07:37 - like MySQL and um SSH and FTP and any
07:43 - well a bunch of different stuff but I'm
07:44 - getting kind of headed myself but there
07:46 - you go hopefully you guys enjoyed go log
07:48 - into your own router and uh yeah see you
07:50 - guys next time
