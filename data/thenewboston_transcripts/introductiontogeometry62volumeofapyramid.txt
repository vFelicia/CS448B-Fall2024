00:01 - so
00:02 - now that we've learned the the surface
00:04 - area of a pyramid we're going to learn
00:07 - how to find the volume of the pyramid
00:10 - so
00:11 - the formula for volume of a pyramid is v
00:14 - equals one-third
00:16 - base area times height okay
00:20 - now there's a couple things we need to
00:22 - talk about first
00:23 - so ba is the area of the base
00:28 - so
00:30 - the area
00:32 - of a base
00:36 - so the area of a base of a pyramid
00:41 - is going to be
00:43 - the area
00:44 - of this square
00:46 - so to find the area of a square we take
00:49 - length times width which for a square we
00:52 - know would just be side squared because
00:54 - they have equal length and width
00:57 - times the height
01:00 - so that's our final formula for volume
01:03 - now when we talk about the height
01:06 - we're not talking about this height of
01:08 - this triangle right here
01:11 - we're talking about the height
01:13 - that if you drew in
01:15 - would come
01:16 - perpendicular from this point up here to
01:20 - the center of the base
01:22 - so the height is the altitude drawn
01:25 - perpendicular to the center of a base
01:29 - so sometimes we're going to have to use
01:31 - our pythagorean theorem
01:33 - to solve
01:36 - for this
01:40 - length because if you look at it
01:43 - this height
01:45 - with this
01:47 - height of this triangle
01:49 - and and this little line right here
01:51 - forms a right right triangle
01:57 - with this being the height
01:59 - this being
02:00 - one half
02:02 - of the length
02:04 - and then this being just the height of
02:06 - the triangle which just so we don't get
02:08 - confused we're just going to call this a
02:12 - so sometimes we're going to have to use
02:14 - that to give us our
02:18 - h but you have to make sure you are
02:20 - taking that
02:22 - the line drawn perpendicular to the
02:24 - center of the base
02:26 - so now that we know how to find volume
02:28 - we're going to do some examples where we
02:30 - have to find volume
02:32 - so volume is equal to 1 3 length times
02:37 - width
02:38 - times h
02:40 - now since it's
02:42 - since we're multiplying these and
02:44 - multiplication is commutative it doesn't
02:47 - matter what order we multiply in as long
02:49 - as we multiply the right stuff
02:52 - so volume is equal to one third
02:56 - and since we know that the bottom of
02:58 - this is a square
03:01 - it'll be
03:02 - eight times eight
03:05 - or eight squared
03:06 - times our height which is this line
03:08 - right here which just so happens to be
03:12 - three
03:13 - so v equals one third
03:17 - 8 times 8 is 64 times 3. now
03:22 - we're going to multiply these all
03:23 - together so if you look the 3
03:27 - is going to cancel to the one-third
03:29 - because when we multiply fractions
03:30 - remember
03:32 - we multiply
03:34 - across
03:35 - so this three is like a three over one
03:38 - and if we multiply across we'd get three
03:40 - over three
03:42 - which is just one
03:43 - so our volume is equal to 64
03:47 - and we're in centimeters so centimeters
03:50 - cubed remember volume is always written
03:55 - in cubic units
03:59 - so now we're going to do one more
04:00 - example
04:02 - so volume is equal to
04:06 - one-third
04:07 - length times width
04:10 - h
04:11 - so volume is equal to one-third
04:13 - four times four
04:17 - h and right here that's a seven
04:22 - so volume is equal to one third times
04:25 - four squared is sixteen
04:27 - times 7.
04:28 - now i don't know that at the top off at
04:30 - the top of my head so i'm going to plug
04:32 - that into a calculator real fast
04:35 - and
04:37 - if you do that
04:44 - you will get thirty
04:47 - seven point three
04:49 - three three
04:50 - repeating
04:52 - and then pretend they gave us inches
04:54 - this would be inches
04:56 - cubed
04:58 - now that's all we're going to do with
05:00 - volume of a pyramid now make sure make
05:03 - sure you come back and watch the next
05:06 - video which is going to be our final
05:09 - video in this series for intro to
05:11 - geometry
05:12 - and then after that we're going to go
05:14 - into geometry with which takes the
05:16 - things we learned in these videos
05:20 - and
05:22 - makes us do something a little bit
05:23 - harder with them so make sure you come
05:25 - back to check that out
