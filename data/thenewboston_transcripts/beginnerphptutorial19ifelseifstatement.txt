00:00 - hello this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:03 - creating this P PHP tutorial for the New
00:05 - Boston now we've already looked at an if
00:08 - else statement which looks something
00:10 - like this um as this stands it evaluates
00:12 - to true so we're echoing out uh the text
00:15 - true now if I was to start a completely
00:18 - new if statement let's say I wanted to
00:21 - evaluate a few more things down the line
00:24 - now let's create a number um number one
00:28 - and that's going to be equal to 10 now
00:30 - we can create a number two and I'm going
00:31 - to create that also equal to
00:35 - 10
00:37 - um no we'll just keep number one so
00:39 - we'll we'll just keep number itself so I
00:42 - want to create an if statement to
00:44 - gradually um make a few comparisons um
00:48 - with this variable so if I was to say if
00:53 - number equals equals 10 so this is is
00:57 - equal to 10
01:03 - Echo equal to 10 so as it stands the
01:08 - number the variable number is equal to
01:11 - 10 therefore this comparison is going to
01:12 - be true so we're going to be echoing out
01:14 - this text so let's just test that in our
01:16 - browser quickly okay equal to 10 now
01:20 - what if I want to say but hold on a
01:21 - minute otherwise I want to make another
01:24 - check so you've seen in my previous
01:26 - examples I've said else Echo and we
01:29 - could could for example say not equal to
01:32 - 10 and if I was to change this value
01:35 - here to 11 you'll be displayed with the
01:38 - text not equal to 10 because the
01:40 - variable does not equal 10 um but let's
01:44 - scrap this idea of of just going
01:46 - straight to else and I want to say else
01:50 - if so I'm basically com combining if and
01:55 - else to make else if and then I just do
01:59 - exact the same structure and I do
02:02 - another block underneath that so else if
02:05 - and here what we can do is before just
02:07 - jumping to else and saying No this
02:08 - doesn't equal and this is evaluated to
02:10 - false we can make another comparison and
02:13 - we can do another evaluation so else if
02:17 - number equals equals
02:20 - 11 and we can now say equal
02:25 - to 11 oh if I can spell it so equal to
02:29 - 11 then what we can do is we can say
02:33 - else not equal for example so now what
02:37 - we're doing is we're saying is the
02:39 - number equal to 10 if it is Echo out
02:43 - this text equal to 10 otherwise is this
02:46 - text equal to 11 and if so we Echo out
02:50 - the text equal to 11 now remember before
02:52 - when I changed this to 11 it said not
02:56 - equal but now I've changed it to 11 this
03:00 - will be evaluated to true or this here
03:03 - in particular will be evaluated to True
03:05 - therefore this is going to be executed
03:07 - so let's refresh the page equal to 11
03:11 - again we can change this up here back to
03:13 - 10 so it's performing this check here
03:16 - and we refresh equal to 10 but if we
03:20 - were to go um as high as 12 we haven't
03:23 - got a check here to be for it to be
03:25 - equal to 12 therefore not equal so this
03:29 - is basically in a nutshell IFL
03:31 - statements and they're useful for just
03:33 - making a few more checks before you want
03:36 - to completely say nope nothing's equal
03:39 - else and give uh the last alternative
03:42 - block to execute
