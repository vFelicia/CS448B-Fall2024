00:00 - what's going on guys it's is Bucky and
00:01 - welcome to your 23rd tutorial and in
00:04 - this tutorial I'm going to be building a
00:06 - simple program and I'm going to be using
00:08 - the for Loop and I'm just going to be
00:10 - using it to show you guys that it is
00:12 - actually useful outside of just showing
00:14 - you guys examples so what we're going to
00:15 - be doing is we're going to say we're
00:18 - going to start with $10,000 and we're
00:20 - going to invest in the stock market and
00:22 - we're smart enough to earn 1% each day
00:25 - on our money so at the end of 20 or 30
00:28 - days how much money did we make so you
00:30 - know it's a little funner program than
00:32 - what we've been programming before it's
00:34 - a little cooler a little break from just
00:36 - basic example so before I get started I
00:38 - want to mention this in our formula for
00:41 - calculating interest rate we need to use
00:44 - a function called power and that's
00:46 - included in the cmath library so make
00:48 - sure you include this before you get
00:50 - started in this tutorial so let's go
00:52 - ahead and get down to it now we're going
00:56 - to be calculating interest rates and
00:59 - stuff like that so we're going to be
01:00 - needing to work with decimal points like
01:02 - 0.01 0.02 for 2% but we already know int
01:07 - so can we use integers when working with
01:10 - decimal points like this no we can't it
01:12 - is for whole numbers only like 98 4 54
01:18 - it is for whole numbers without a
01:19 - decimal place so in order to use a
01:22 - decimal place we need to have a new type
01:24 - of variable and that's called float
01:27 - float is basically the data type that
01:29 - allows you to work with decimal places
01:31 - there are a couple different ones but
01:33 - this is one of them one of the most
01:34 - popular ones so let's go ahead and make
01:36 - a variable called a and this is going to
01:38 - be the amount we're trying to figure out
01:40 - how much money did we make the next uh
01:44 - variable we need is called principal so
01:46 - float P equals your principal amount in
01:50 - in everyday terms how much money did you
01:53 - invest how much money did you start with
01:56 - well say we just had $10,000 laying
01:58 - around so let's go ahead and start with
01:59 - with that um I wish I had $10,000 around
02:02 - but hey we can dream can't we so now
02:05 - let's go ahead and say this our last
02:08 - variable is rate so I'm going to set it
02:10 - equal to R and that's how much interest
02:13 - do you want to earn each day and let's
02:15 - say we can earn 1% each day and that's
02:18 - 0.01 if you had 2% it would be 0.02 make
02:22 - sure not to put two or one for this you
02:25 - need
02:25 - 0.01 and or else it's not going to work
02:28 - so let's go ahead and use the for Loop
02:31 - to run through each day so what this is
02:34 - going to be doing is looping through
02:35 - each day one by one one 2 3 4 5 six
02:39 - seven days and each day is going to give
02:41 - us a dollar amount how much money did we
02:43 - earn that day at 1% so of course the for
02:47 - Loop is going to Loop through days let's
02:49 - go ahead and make a variable called
02:51 - day int day and we'll start at day one
02:55 - obviously and the next parameter it
02:57 - needs is how long do you want to invest
02:59 - invest your money for so let's say um 20
03:02 - days so day is less than or equal to 20
03:05 - days and of course day Plus+ because one
03:08 - day at a time we're not skipping any
03:10 - days and we're not taking any vacation
03:12 - time here so now the formula for
03:14 - interest rate is this the amount of
03:17 - money that you earned is equal to the
03:19 - principal amount times and in
03:23 - parenthesis put
03:24 - this actually no not yet the principal
03:28 - amount times the power
03:30 - and this is where you put parenthesis 1
03:32 - plus the rate and this is would be let
03:36 - me go ahead and type this out I can't
03:37 - talk and tell you guys Financial
03:39 - formulas at the same time the formula
03:42 - for calculating interest rate is this
03:44 - the amount of money you're going to make
03:46 - is equal to your principal investment
03:48 - times 1 plus rate and the rate would be
03:50 - 01 in this case to the day exponent so
03:55 - it would be like um 1% 1.01% % to the
04:00 - 20th power so I mean it's a weird
04:04 - formula but that's how you calculate
04:05 - just trust me it works so anyways now
04:08 - what we have to do is just print out on
04:10 - the screen how much money we're going to
04:11 - make so let's give it a nice little
04:13 - print thing um let's go ahead and print
04:15 - the day first and then just want to give
04:17 - it a nice little spacer
04:20 - here there we go and then we go ahead
04:23 - and write a a is the amount of money
04:26 - that we're making and then go ahead and
04:28 - we'll print this on a new line each time
04:30 - so let's go ahead and run it and you'll
04:32 - see what I'm talking about whenever I
04:33 - run it so here is the day to the left 1
04:37 - through 20 we start off and at the end
04:40 - of the first day if we invest $10,000 at
04:43 - 1% we earn $100 at the end of that first
04:46 - day at the end of the ninth day we
04:49 - almost earned
04:52 - $111,000 if we invested
04:54 - $10,000 and we earned 1% each day for 20
04:58 - days at the end of your your 20th day
05:00 - you would earn over
05:02 - $12,000 well you would actually earn
05:05 - $22,000 but calculating the money you
05:07 - already had in there you would have over
05:10 - $122,000 that's pretty sweet huh so now
05:13 - you know why everyone wants to get in a
05:15 - stock trading because basically by just
05:17 - sitting at your computer and clicking
05:19 - buttons making trades you can earn
05:21 - $2,000 in 20 days pretty sweet huh so
05:25 - since you know this is fake money and
05:27 - we're just dreaming let's say that we
05:29 - could we were a genius like Warren
05:32 - Buffett or Bill Gates and we were smart
05:34 - enough to earn 3% each day and let's say
05:36 - we invested this for 30 days so go ahead
05:40 - and let me run this oh mama check this
05:43 - out if you invested money for 30 days
05:46 - and you earn just 3% on your money each
05:49 - day at the end of 30 days or one month
05:52 - you would over double your money you
05:54 - would have
05:56 - $24,000 and more and enough to go out to
05:58 - Taco Bell so that is pretty sweet and uh
06:02 - this makes me second guess my career as
06:04 - a computer programmer and kind of makes
06:05 - me want to get in the stock market but
06:07 - by the way before you guys get into the
06:09 - stock market earning 3% a year would be
06:12 - good nowadays uh earning 3% a day is
06:16 - virtually impossible unless you're like
06:17 - Warren Buffett so anyways there is your
06:20 - tutorial on a useful way to use the four
06:22 - loopin program and also you know some
06:24 - Financial device to the formula for APR
06:28 - so there you go and uh I hope you guys
06:30 - learned at least something from this
06:32 - tutoral and hopefully I didn't get you
06:34 - addicted to the stock market because hey
06:36 - we got more C++ to learn guys so thank
06:38 - you guys for watching don't forget to
06:39 - subscribe and uh yeah I'll see you guys
06:41 - later
