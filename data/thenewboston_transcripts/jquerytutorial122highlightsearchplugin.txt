00:00 - so highlight is the class that we need
00:03 - to go ahead and create so inside here
00:06 - I'm going to go ahead and create a
00:07 - highlight class and I'm essentially well
00:10 - basically just going to set the
00:12 - background color to yellow so now what's
00:16 - going to happen is if we were to if we
00:18 - were to apply this to any element on our
00:19 - page for example search it would be the
00:22 - same if we were to actually perform the
00:24 - search as creating a span around this
00:26 - with a class of highlight and now sorry
00:32 - highlight now that's taken the class and
00:35 - applied it to this particular span here
00:39 - so that's basically what the plug-in
00:41 - does just as a bit of a background
00:43 - information on that but obviously our
00:46 - highlight our highlighter plug-in here
00:49 - is going to do all the work for us so
00:51 - what we want to do is we want to
00:53 - reference something in a selector and
00:57 - then apply the high highlight plug-in to
01:02 - this and in here we need to provide the
01:04 - search term now the search term is
01:07 - obviously search underscore term the
01:09 - value that we stored from the text area
01:11 - however what do we want to do with go
01:14 - ahead and when we go ahead and actually
01:16 - select this now there's a few things
01:18 - that we could do in terms of this we've
01:22 - got a paragraph surrounding this
01:23 - paragraph of text so what we could do is
01:26 - we could place a P in there and that
01:28 - will just mean any element that's inside
01:30 - or any any text that matches this value
01:33 - here inside of P we're going to go ahead
01:36 - and highlight it so we can go ahead and
01:38 - actually test this that's just refresh
01:40 - I'm going to go ahead and type search
01:42 - and click find and you can see that a
01:44 - search has now been highlighted or we
01:47 - could go ahead and type a and you can
01:48 - see this you know everything's been
01:50 - highlighted here
01:52 - so what's going to happen now is we need
01:55 - to change this so everything on our page
01:58 - is searched for so at the moment if I
02:01 - was to take this out of its paragraph
02:04 - okay you'll be able to see that when we
02:07 - search for something so search and click
02:09 - find you see nothing happens and the
02:11 - reason for this is that we need a
02:13 - selector that's global to the to the
02:15 - page now when I was testing out this
02:18 - plug-in I thought it would be acceptable
02:21 - to go ahead and use document dot
02:23 - highlight to search for something on the
02:25 - document now this will work with regards
02:28 - to this paragraph now let's just have a
02:31 - look when we refresh oh no it doesn't
02:35 - work yeah okay so essentially this is
02:40 - the problem that we that we have we've
02:42 - got document dot highlight search term
02:44 - what we actually need to do is go ahead
02:46 - and use the asterisk selector to select
02:48 - everything on the page so it will
02:51 - essentially search between any element I
02:53 - think this will work if you were to type
02:56 - body with this outside of the paragraph
03:00 - if I was to go ahead and use search you
03:03 - can see that that's worked now because
03:05 - we've got this plain text within our
03:07 - body and not within another element if I
03:10 - was to go ahead and change this to P and
03:13 - we have this text within a paragraph
03:15 - using the body selector won't work now
03:18 - because although it's within the body oh
03:20 - it does work okay right that's fair
03:23 - enough absolutely fair enough maybe I
03:26 - sort of overlooked this but using the
03:29 - using an asterisk selector will select
03:31 - you know throughout the page so it's
03:33 - sort of like a global search across the
03:35 - page selecting all elements so when we
03:37 - click find this successfully highlights
03:39 - for us now we do have another problem in
03:43 - terms of when we go ahead and perform
03:44 - another search which you might have
03:46 - caught earlier when I typed in a and
03:48 - click defined you can see that search
03:50 - has still been highlighted now the
03:53 - reason for this is that we have not
03:55 - removed the class from here if we go
03:58 - ahead and look inside highlight j/s and
04:00 - we come down
04:02 - you can see that we've got this almost
04:04 - other plugin which is called remove
04:07 - highlight so remove highlight will
04:09 - remove the highlight you know from you
04:13 - know a particular place so what I'm
04:16 - going to do is I'm going to go ahead and
04:17 - just before we use highlight search term
04:22 - I'm going to remove high light and what
04:27 - that will do is it will just remove the
04:29 - highlight altogether so now what happens
04:32 - is when we go ahead and search for say
04:34 - search we highlight this but when we
04:36 - perform a new search for say just a what
04:39 - will happen is we'll remove the
04:41 - highlight before we then go and
04:42 - highlight the new search term so when we
04:45 - click find you can see that it's been
04:48 - it's been removed but then again we have
04:51 - another problem where we've actually you
04:54 - know just remove the entire element so
04:58 - what we can go ahead and do is just
04:59 - analyze this and we'll want to go and
05:04 - we'll want to make a change to this now
05:07 - the problem is is that when we're
05:08 - selecting everything we're talking about
05:11 - selecting absolutely everything in this
05:13 - in this case what we're going to want to
05:16 - go and do now is because we do actually
05:18 - face this problem with the search
05:20 - clicking find and searching something
05:23 - typing a and not actually removing the
05:26 - entire span together we want to go ahead
05:28 - and change this to body so now what's
05:31 - going to happen is when we go ahead and
05:33 - search for something and click find we
05:35 - highlight search but when we perform a
05:37 - new search for a it doesn't actually
05:39 - remove the element altogether
05:41 - so we've now actually you know
05:43 - highlighted everything completely
05:45 - successfully so this highlight function
05:49 - here available obviously at this address
05:52 - here has just used a class it's taken a
05:56 - particular element on a page and by all
05:59 - means this could be a particular div so
06:02 - for example you could reference it with
06:03 - a hash if it was a particular area you
06:06 - were searching in for example a Content
06:08 - area obviously if you were performing
06:11 - this globally across the page inside of
06:13 - your
06:14 - the area in your page you're looking at
06:17 - you know highlighting absolutely
06:18 - everything you might just have a
06:20 - specific content area on your page and
06:22 - you might want you might solve wondering
06:25 - disclude or exclude a menu rather so
06:30 - we've removed highlight before we've
06:32 - gone and we highlighted because
06:33 - highlight is just going to apply this
06:35 - span as we analyzed earlier it's
06:38 - applying a span with a class name
06:39 - highlight so it's quite a useful plugin
06:43 - I just wanted to quickly go over you
06:45 - know something like this how it's you
06:47 - know quite lightweight it's about two
06:49 - kilobytes in file size well 1 1 3 7 4 so
06:55 - it's you know extremely lightweight and
06:58 - quite useful as well and the benefit of
07:01 - this is that if we wanted to say change
07:03 - something like the font weight to bold
07:06 - we can go ahead and do so and that will
07:08 - literally just update the process of
07:10 - highlighting so if we click search this
07:13 - will turn this bold as well so we can
07:15 - customize out how we want inside a style
07:18 - sheet so that's just a quick example of
07:20 - another plugin and how you would install
07:22 - it and also how to sort of select in the
07:25 - right place and also removing then then
07:28 - highlighting the next search term that's
07:30 - searched for so again a simple plugin
07:33 - and extremely useful
