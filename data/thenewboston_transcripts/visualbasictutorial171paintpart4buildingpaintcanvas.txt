00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:02 - slash on live gamer for the New Boston
00:04 - in this tutorial we're going to continue
00:07 - working on our paint program now if this
00:10 - is it this isn't familiar to you you may
00:12 - want to move back to the beginning of
00:13 - these tutorials and once again this
00:16 - program is from the book beginning
00:18 - Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 by fear on
00:21 - Willis and Brian Newsome post by rocks
00:24 - it's a great book
00:28 - but there are better books out there
00:30 - it's still good for a beginning so
00:32 - beginners to learn and it takes you
00:34 - through making a whole bunch of programs
00:36 - so let's go ahead and continue what we
00:39 - were doing so here is our paint canvas
00:42 - class we've got our enumerations the
00:44 - graphic sizes and the graphics tools so
00:48 - we'll go ahead and
00:49 - put those two together now let's go
00:52 - ahead and create some public variables
00:56 - so public variables and
00:59 - let's make an ArrayList so public
01:03 - graphics items as new ArrayList
01:10 - and we're going to create a graphics
01:13 - tool so public
01:17 - graphic tool as
01:22 - graphics tools
01:25 - and we're going to set that equal to
01:27 - graphics tools
01:30 - dot circle pin because that is our only
01:33 - option and
01:34 - now will cute we will create the graphic
01:38 - sighs so public graphics size as
01:42 - graphic sizes
01:44 - and then
01:48 - we're going to set it equal to
01:50 - graphic sizes
02:00 - dot medium so we'll just make the brush
02:04 - medium-sized right now and now we're
02:08 - going to need one more variable so
02:11 - public
02:12 - graphics color as colored and we'll set
02:17 - it equal to color dot black
02:21 - let's go ahead and add an S right there
02:23 - so these are all matched up so here we
02:26 - have our graphics item ArrayList and
02:29 - this is going to hold a whole bunch of
02:32 - graphics items object now it can also
02:35 - hold graphics circle objects because the
02:37 - graphic circles inherit from
02:41 - the graphics items they are treated as a
02:44 - graphics items object even though that
02:46 - an ArrayList can hold any data type
02:49 - we're gonna be filling it with types
02:51 - even graphics items or graphics circles
02:53 - and then we have our graphics tool which
02:57 - is the circle pin which is what we're
02:59 - going to be drawing
03:00 - on the paint canvas with and say circle
03:03 - pin we've got our graphic size which is
03:06 - set to medium which will be 10 and just
03:10 - kind of a little bit of spoiler 10 is
03:13 - gonna be the side of the square so it's
03:14 - gonna be a 10 by 10 square it's going to
03:16 - create a circle out of that so it's
03:18 - gonna have a circle with a diameter of
03:20 - 10 pixels and then we have our color our
03:24 - graphics color which is going to be
03:26 - equal to black that's pretty
03:27 - self-explanatory
03:30 - okay so now we need to make some private
03:35 - methods so we'll just call this one
03:38 - private and we'll make it a sub because
03:41 - it doesn't return anything and it will
03:44 - call it do Mouse paint and what we're
03:49 - gonna need for a do Mouse paint is a
03:53 - some arguments so we're just gonna need
03:56 - 1 arguments and we're gonna by Val E as
03:59 - Mouse event args so E is gonna be the
04:04 - arguments and what its gonna let us do
04:06 - is it's gonna let us get the x position
04:10 - and the y position of where the mouse is
04:12 - on the screen so what we've used Mouse
04:15 - event arts before in the program that
04:17 - animated a-squared so under doo-doo
04:21 - mouse paint what we're gonna do is
04:24 - create a new object so we'll call it
04:28 - object
04:30 - graphics
04:32 - item as
04:34 - graphics item
04:37 - so now we have a graphics items item
04:40 - object you can see that's got a little
04:42 - green line under it because we haven't
04:44 - used it yet
04:45 - so now we're gonna select which tool we
04:48 - are using so we'll use a select case
04:51 - here but because we are only using
04:55 - [Music]
04:57 - one there's only one possible thing for
05:02 - this we're gonna only need one select
05:04 - case here now the reason we're doing
05:06 - select case is in case we want to add
05:09 - more to our program later on we can just
05:11 - add some items to our select case and
05:13 - add some items to our numeration and our
05:16 - programs gonna work on the same way it
05:17 - did but we're gonna have some more
05:19 - options now this is a good thing to do
05:21 - when you're making programs is to make
05:24 - it so that you can expand your program
05:25 - and
05:28 - so it's easier to add more stuff in the
05:32 - future so we'll just add case
05:37 - graphics tool
05:40 - or
05:42 - graphics tools dot circle pin so if
05:47 - circle pin is selected what do we want
05:50 - to do we want to create a new
05:54 - object of graphics circle so we'll just
05:58 - declare it so object graphics circle
06:03 - and we're gonna make a new graphics
06:08 - circle object so you can see we have it
06:10 - right here which is what we created and
06:14 - it doesn't take any arguments so now
06:16 - that we've created our object of
06:18 - graphics circle which is going to draw a
06:20 - circle on the screen what we want to do
06:22 - is we want to set the point for that so
06:26 - object graphics circle dot set point
06:29 - it's gonna take our X position our y
06:33 - position our size color and is filled so
06:38 - to get our x position what we want to do
06:40 - is type e dot X so for our mouse event
06:44 - args and a dot X is going to hold the x
06:47 - position position of the mouse and then
06:50 - we're gonna do a dot Y for the y
06:51 - coordinates and if we come over here to
06:54 - graphic circle or graphics item I mean
06:57 - we have set points it's gonna take the
07:00 - eggs and to subtract graphics size
07:02 - divided by 2 from it which basically
07:04 - just sets wherever your mouse in the
07:07 - middle of your mouse is to the center of
07:09 - the circle instead of the top-left
07:11 - corner so come back over here to paint
07:13 - canvas dot B B and then we're gonna need
07:16 - to fill in the rest of
07:19 - the arguments so for the third argument
07:22 - we're just gonna do graphics
07:26 - size
07:30 - so and then we're gonna need
07:34 - graphic
07:37 - color so let's find the name up here
07:40 - this gets a little confusing graphics
07:43 - color
07:45 - and
07:46 - then we're going to need the graphics is
07:49 - filled so for this we're just gonna use
07:52 - true because we do want to fill our
07:55 - circle
07:57 - now you can play with this and set that
08:00 - equal to false if you want and see what
08:02 - happens later on so now what we need to
08:04 - do is we need to store this item so that
08:06 - we can add it to our ArrayList so object
08:10 - graphics item
08:13 - equals
08:14 - object graphics circle now we have
08:19 - objects graphics items which is a type
08:21 - graphics items so this variable right
08:23 - here is of type graphics item but
08:26 - because object graphics circle which is
08:29 - a graphic circle inherits from graphics
08:31 - items we can use polymorphism to set
08:33 - this equal to a subclass of itself
08:37 - so we're gonna add more to this sub when
08:41 - we get back it's just I'm running out of
08:43 - time in this tutorial so if you have any
08:45 - questions leave them in the comments and
08:47 - if not go ahead and move forward
