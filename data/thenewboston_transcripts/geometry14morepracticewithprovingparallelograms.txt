00:00 - okay so we're gonna do some more
00:04 - practice with proving that a
00:07 - parallelogram is a parallelogram so for
00:11 - this example you're given that a B is
00:14 - parallel to DC okay and you know that OB
00:23 - is congruent to that should say OD sorry
00:31 - OD prove that ABCD is a parallelogram so
00:40 - first we'll write our given a B parallel
00:46 - the DC o be congruent to OD and we're
00:54 - given that okay so what we're gonna do
01:01 - is we need to get well there's two
01:06 - things we could do we could prove that
01:09 - these two triangles are congruent and
01:12 - then say that this side is congruent to
01:16 - this side and therefore the it is a
01:20 - parallelogram or we could get them
01:23 - congruent and say this side equals this
01:27 - side and then therefore o bisects these
01:32 - two so it really doesn't matter which
01:36 - way you do it one way might have a
01:39 - little less steps to it okay
01:45 - so we need we need to we need to prove
01:51 - that these two triangles are congruent
01:53 - first okay so if you look these two
01:58 - angles right here are a special kind of
02:01 - angle their vertical angles and if you
02:04 - remember vertical angles are congruent
02:07 - so in this step we can say angle and
02:10 - this time we have to write it with three
02:14 - letters because they share this same
02:17 - vertex so angle a OB is congruent to
02:22 - angle D OC vertical so if vertical
02:31 - angles then congruent okay
02:36 - the next thing we can do since we know
02:39 - that this line is parallel to this line
02:42 - and there cut by this transversal we can
02:47 - get angle be congruent to angle D so
02:52 - angle a be au is congruent to angle D
03:03 - excuse me not angle D angle C D oh and
03:12 - that if lines are parallel then
03:19 - alternate interior angles are congruent
03:24 - so now we have an angle a side and an
03:29 - angle and if you remember that's one of
03:30 - our properties for proving triangles
03:33 - congruent so triangle a B oh is
03:40 - congruent to triangle C D oh by eight
03:46 - goals side angle
03:50 - and then we can get a be congruent to DC
03:58 - if triangles are congruent their
04:03 - corresponding parts responding parts are
04:11 - also congruent and finally I can say a/b
04:16 - c/d
04:17 - is a parallelogram because if opposite
04:22 - sides are congruent and parallel then it
04:29 - is a parallelogram so
04:58 - it's congruent to triangle
05:00 - E Dez by side-angle-side so now I have
05:08 - one opposite pair of opposite sides
05:12 - congruent and that's to prove it's a
05:15 - parallelogram we need this pair of
05:16 - opposite sides congruent so since we
05:20 - just proved that the triangles are
05:21 - congruent we can say a B is congruent to
05:25 - DC if triangles congruent corresponding
05:32 - parts are congruent and finally because
05:39 - I have two pairs of opposite sides that
05:41 - are congruent I can say ABCD is a
05:45 - parallelogram because two pairs opposite
05:53 - sides congruent then it is a
05:59 - parallelogram so that's all we have to
06:03 - do with parallelograms today but make
06:07 - sure you come back when we move on to
06:09 - circles and a sector of a circle and an
06:13 - arc of a circle
