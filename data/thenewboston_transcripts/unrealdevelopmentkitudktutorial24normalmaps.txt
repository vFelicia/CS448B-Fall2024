00:01 - what's up guys welcome to your 24th udk
00:03 - tutorial and in this tutorial i'm going
00:05 - to be enhancing our texture a little bit
00:08 - so
00:09 - in the last tutorial what we did is we
00:11 - gave our material an overall look and we
00:14 - just made it basically to look like
00:16 - bricks but if we scroll around our
00:19 - material a little bit we're going to
00:20 - notice a couple things first of all it
00:23 - looks kind of bland and another thing
00:26 - this material right here it doesn't
00:28 - really pop out because in real life
00:30 - these bricks would kind of stick out and
00:32 - in between the bricks it would have some
00:34 - depth this part would be indented and
00:38 - right now it really doesn't have a lot
00:40 - of bumpiness or depth to it so we can
00:43 - change that right now by applying the
00:45 - normal setting now this normal setting
00:48 - right here is a setting you can use to
00:50 - apply depth or bumpiness to your
00:53 - material
00:54 - so in order to do that what we need to
00:56 - do is we need to include something
00:58 - called a normal map
01:00 - now a normal map has information about
01:03 - which
01:04 - what part of your material you want to
01:06 - stick out what part you want to indent
01:08 - what part you want to apply bumps to
01:10 - this is pretty much the picture of what
01:13 - material you want to use now the normal
01:15 - map is saying
01:17 - what areas you want to have you know
01:20 - indented and stuff like that so enough
01:21 - of me talking let me just go ahead and
01:23 - do it
01:23 - go ahead and in order to apply a normal
01:26 - map go ahead and right click and hit
01:29 - texture
01:31 - new texture sample
01:33 - and now what we need to do is instead of
01:35 - applying just plain old texture to this
01:37 - we need to apply a normal map to it so
01:40 - whenever you import
01:42 - textures into your udk you're going to
01:45 - have two things you're going to have the
01:47 - texture itself and you're going to have
01:49 - a normal map so let me go ahead and see
01:51 - if i can find this texture
01:54 - so whenever they imported this this is
01:56 - the texture itself
01:58 - and this is the normal map right here so
02:01 - go ahead and select this normal map
02:03 - and then go ahead and select this green
02:05 - arrow and this is going to say use the
02:07 - currently selected object in the content
02:09 - browser and whenever i do that you say
02:12 - that it imports the normal map as my
02:14 - texture
02:15 - so let me give you guys a quick little
02:18 - background or history on normal maps
02:21 - like i said a normal map
02:23 - isn't a texture itself it's basically
02:25 - saying all right
02:27 - these are the parts of the texture that
02:29 - you should indent out that and stuff
02:31 - like that so as you can see right now
02:34 - it doesn't really look like a regular
02:36 - picture it has three colors basically a
02:39 - red green and a blue color
02:42 - the red color
02:43 - shows the x pixels that should be
02:45 - intended the green colors show
02:49 - where the y pixels should be indented
02:52 - and the blue color shows which z pixels
02:54 - should be intended basically i'm going
02:56 - to be going over this whenever we make
02:58 - our own normal maps in photoshop but for
03:00 - now just remember
03:02 - normal maps tell your texture which area
03:05 - should be outdented and indented normal
03:07 - maps basically apply depth to your
03:10 - material
03:11 - so in order to apply this normal map
03:14 - to our material we need to go ahead and
03:16 - take this normal map and stick it into
03:19 - our normal
03:21 - right there pretty cool huh so actually
03:24 - let me go ahead and delete that and go
03:26 - ahead and keep your eyes on this while i
03:28 - do it so nothing yet and then go ahead
03:31 - and keep your eyes on that material and
03:33 - when i go ahead and release this you can
03:35 - see that
03:36 - the bricks now look like they're
03:38 - sticking out
03:40 - and it kind of gets indented
03:43 - where the black should be right there so
03:45 - let me go ahead and delete that one more
03:46 - time just so you guys can see the
03:48 - difference and apply it and check it out
03:51 - our bricks now have some depth to them
03:54 - pretty cool huh so now that we have an
03:57 - enhanced material we can go ahead and
04:00 - save this material
04:02 - and then go ahead and x out of this and
04:05 - then you can see our materials if we go
04:07 - ahead and clear this out
04:09 - we want to go ahead and save our package
04:13 - and now we have our new enhanced brick
04:15 - material so now we can use this new
04:18 - brick material which now has the newly
04:21 - uh normal map aka has some depth to it
04:24 - to apply anywhere
04:26 - in our level so go ahead and let me just
04:28 - if i can drag and drop that right there
04:31 - so pretty cool huh we can use our
04:34 - texture to you know make a weird-looking
04:35 - cube if we want a pink side that glows
04:38 - and two bricks
04:40 - pretty cool huh so that's basically how
04:42 - you use normal maps what they are and
04:45 - again
04:46 - whenever you import textures or excuse
04:49 - me whenever you import yeah textures
04:51 - from photoshop or something into the udk
04:54 - it's going to have two pieces it's going
04:55 - to have the texture itself in the normal
04:58 - map which gives depth information so
05:00 - that's how you apply the texture and the
05:03 - normal map to make one sweet looking
05:06 - material so now that we understand the
05:08 - basics of how to do that we're ready to
05:10 - move on to some more advanced materials
05:12 - but for now thank you guys for watching
