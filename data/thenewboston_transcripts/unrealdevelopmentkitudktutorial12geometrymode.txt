00:01 - all right guys welcome to your 12th udk
00:03 - tutorial and in this tutorial I want to
00:05 - talk to you guys about something called
00:06 - geometry mode now before I explain to
00:09 - you guys what geometry mode is and how
00:11 - we can access it let me tell you guys
00:12 - the goal of this tutorial say we're
00:15 - building this house right here and you
00:16 - know this house is looking pretty good
00:18 - but it's all square and it doesn't
00:21 - really have a lot of flavor it's pretty
00:23 - boring and Bland so what I decided that
00:25 - we should do is we should definitely
00:28 - expand the length of this porch because
00:30 - look how small this porch is right now I
00:31 - definitely want it a little longer and
00:33 - also I want to change the shape of it a
00:35 - little bit so the first thing that we
00:37 - need to do is say I want to double the
00:39 - length of this porch what I need to do
00:42 - is first figure out how long this porch
00:44 - is so if I go up in my front view and
00:47 - hold my mouse wheel I can measure the
00:49 - length of the porch and I can see that
00:51 - is 320 units long so just take a note of
00:55 - that write it down somewhere if you need
00:57 - to whenever we're working in Geometry
00:59 - mode later on we need to add 320 to it
01:02 - so now let's hop into geometry mode and
01:05 - before I even do that I'm going to tell
01:07 - you guys whenever you're working with
01:09 - geometry mode it might be helpful to
01:11 - work in this brush wireframe mode so by
01:14 - default we're in this unlit mode I'm
01:15 - going to hop over to brush wireframe
01:17 - mode and it allows me to see my geometry
01:19 - a little bit better so in order to
01:22 - access geometry mode go ahead and hit
01:25 - this button right here geometry mode by
01:27 - default we're in camera mode but we're
01:29 - want to work in Geometry mode so go
01:31 - ahead and hit that and you know that
01:32 - you're in Geometry mode because your
01:34 - geometry tools window pops up makes
01:37 - sense so what geometry mode is is this
01:41 - it allows you to work with the different
01:44 - aspects of your shape instead of your
01:46 - shape as a whole now what do I mean by
01:48 - that every polygon or every shape that
01:51 - we make in 3D consists of a couple parts
01:54 - the first thing it consists of is these
01:57 - points these points right here a card
02:00 - vertex and by the way let me say this
02:02 - before I even continue the correct term
02:04 - for one of these points is a vertex the
02:07 - correct term for multiple vertex is
02:10 - vertices but I call them vertexes it may
02:13 - make me sound stupid but I'm going to
02:15 - call them vertexes anyways even though I
02:17 - know they're called vertices it just
02:19 - makes my life a whole lot easier so
02:21 - pretty much vertexes are these points in
02:24 - space now aside from these vertexes we
02:27 - have an additional thing and that's the
02:30 - this if you can see it might be a little
02:31 - hard to see right now but see this
02:33 - orange line I selected that is called
02:36 - the edge of a shape now the edge is bit
02:39 - pretty much the line between two
02:41 - vertexes or vertices so we have a
02:46 - vertex and an edge which is pretty much
02:49 - the line that connects to vertices and
02:52 - also if we select right here in the
02:54 - middle this is a face now the face is
02:57 - pretty much the surface the big area on
03:00 - your polygon so with those terms defined
03:03 - we're ready to move on and actually
03:04 - start learning something useful so what
03:07 - I want to do in this tutorial is I'm
03:09 - going to select this face right here
03:11 - because this is the face I'm going to be
03:13 - expanding so in order to expand this
03:17 - section of our polygon in Geometry mode
03:19 - with this face selected let me zoom in a
03:22 - little bit it might be a little easier
03:23 - to see with this face selected go ahead
03:26 - and hit extrude now extrude pretty much
03:29 - means add length to this polygon so I
03:32 - already have it set up to add 320 but
03:35 - you guys might be like 16 by default or
03:37 - something if it is just go ahead and add
03:39 - 320 to it and then go ahead and hit
03:42 - apply now as you can see what that did
03:45 - is it took that shape right there and
03:48 - added basically a new segment a new
03:50 - polygon to it and that new polygon was
03:54 - 320 length units whatever they are I
03:56 - don't want to say pixels I don't know if
03:58 - they're pixels but 320 units nonetheless
04:02 - so now we're saying all right job number
04:04 - one accomplished successfully so let me
04:07 - go ahead and Shrink this and get it out
04:08 - of the way because it's kind of annoying
04:10 - me and let me scroll out in my
04:12 - perspective View and you're saying all
04:13 - right Bucky you told me before that we
04:16 - wanted to do two things we wanted to add
04:18 - link to this and we also wanted to
04:20 - change the shape so in order to change
04:23 - the shape let me go ahead and in my top
04:25 - view I'm going to scroll out a little
04:28 - bit and what I'm going to do is what I
04:30 - want to do is you know how this is kind
04:32 - of square right here I want to kind of
04:35 - give it a beveled Edge so you know just
04:37 - give it a little more flavor design so
04:40 - in order to do that go ahead and in your
04:42 - top view select this vertex right here
04:45 - now since we're looking at it in a
04:47 - bird's eye view kind of top down
04:49 - airplane view it doesn't know if we want
04:52 - to select this one or the one underneath
04:54 - it so what the udk does is it selects
04:57 - every single vertex that's directly
04:59 - underneath it
05:00 - so if I go ahead and look in my
05:02 - perspective view let me go ahead and
05:04 - zoom really in here check it out
05:07 - whenever I select one of these vertexes
05:10 - it selects both of them since they're
05:11 - directly on top of each other if I only
05:13 - want to select one of them I could do
05:15 - that in this view but since we're
05:16 - working in the top view go ahead and
05:18 - select them both and now what I want to
05:21 - do is I want to jump over to my
05:23 - translation mode and whenever I'm in my
05:26 - translation mode I can actually move
05:28 - these vertexes around so go ahead and
05:30 - scroll in and I'm just going toe go
05:33 - ahead and move mine to a nice 45 degree
05:36 - angle and I
05:38 - think right there is where I want to be
05:40 - so if I deselect this I can see that it
05:43 - cuts nicely across 45 degre and if I go
05:47 - ahead and zoom out over my perspective
05:48 - mode you can see that this gives my
05:50 - porch a little more flavor it's
05:52 - definitely a little more exciting than
05:53 - you know just a plain straight corner so
05:56 - now what I want to do is I want to do
05:58 - the exact same thing with this vertex
06:00 - over here so go ahead and select this
06:02 - and let me scroll out in my perspective
06:04 - mode it might be a little easier to see
06:07 - and like I said I want to do the exact
06:08 - same thing right here so go ahead and in
06:11 - your top mode translation mode of course
06:13 - go ahead and move this till we get a
06:15 - nice 45° angle right here as well and if
06:19 - we zoom in we can see that it indeed
06:22 - cuts at a night nice 45°
06:25 - angle so now you can see my house is
06:28 - looking a lot more interesting than
06:30 - before we have a nice expanded porch and
06:33 - we have these at a nice angle so now
06:36 - with that being said we can go ahead and
06:38 - jump out of geometry mode and hop over
06:40 - to unlit mode and you're saying all
06:42 - right we just built this awesome porch
06:45 - hit on lit mode and it disappeared well
06:48 - the reason for that is because remember
06:49 - I said anytime you update your geometry
06:52 - you need to explicitly rebuild your
06:55 - geometry so once you rebuild your
06:56 - geometry you're going to see that nice
06:58 - porch expans mention so that is the
07:01 - basics of geometry mode again with
07:04 - camera mode it lets you to it allows you
07:07 - to work with shapes as a whole basically
07:09 - but anytime you want to edit the
07:11 - nitty-gritty um vertexes edges faces of
07:14 - a polygon or shape you need to hop over
07:16 - in Geometry mode and geometry mode
07:19 - allows you to change the geometry of an
07:21 - object so that's all I want to talk to
07:23 - you guys about in this tutorial in the
07:25 - next couple tutorials I'm going to be
07:26 - adding some doors some windows bu
07:29 - building of the porch up adding a roof
07:31 - going to be doing a whole bunch of stuff
07:33 - but for now that's all you guys get so
07:35 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
07:36 - to subscribe and I'll see you guys in
07:37 - the next video
