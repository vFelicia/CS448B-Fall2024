00:00 - our rit mofos welcome back and in this
00:02 - video I am going to show you how to use
00:03 - properties in react now properties allow
00:07 - you to basically customize your
00:09 - components so say that you're making
00:12 - this application kind of like Netflix
00:14 - any application where you want it to
00:16 - display movies well of course you didn't
00:20 - want to make a component to display
00:21 - movie and then when you want it to
00:23 - display another movie you had to make a
00:25 - whole different component that had a
00:27 - different title and maybe like the main
00:29 - image for it you would basically want to
00:32 - make the blueprint or a template for one
00:35 - component and customize it in a bunch of
00:37 - different ways so that's what properties
00:38 - allow you to do so let's actually go
00:40 - ahead and do that example so I'm going
00:43 - to make it called a movie and remember
00:45 - anytime you make a component you just
00:46 - write react crate class make sure you
00:51 - get your semicolons in the right place
00:53 - and all right
00:53 - so we'll keep things real simple all I'm
00:57 - going to do for this component is I'm
00:58 - just going to display a heading 1 and
00:59 - heading 2 and we'll say that the heading
01:01 - 1 is the main title of the movie and the
01:04 - heading 2 can be like the genre or a
01:06 - description of the movie or something so
01:08 - render function and remember all this
01:12 - does all components do is they
01:15 - essentially just return some HTML so
01:19 - inside here since we're going to want a
01:21 - heading 1 and heading 2 then I'm going
01:23 - to need to wrap those and then div and
01:27 - now just put heading 1 and I'll say
01:31 - movie name and again this is what we're
01:34 - going to want to replace this is going
01:36 - to be equal to something like Avatar
01:38 - Good Will Hunting it's going to be
01:40 - different every time we use this
01:41 - component but right now I just hit that
01:43 - as a placeholder and why are you not
01:46 - copying all right so for heading 2 will
01:51 - just write the genre
01:54 - and just so we make sure that everything
01:57 - is working up to this point let me just
01:59 - go ahead and render one of these
02:00 - components right here so if I go ahead
02:03 - and refresh this alright our component
02:05 - is looking good but of course we don't
02:08 - just want this in here we want custom
02:10 - properties so instead of just using your
02:15 - component like this you can actually add
02:17 - attributes to it just like you have
02:19 - attributes right here and they're equal
02:22 - to some value you can do that in your
02:24 - own custom components as well so in this
02:27 - movie component let me just say title
02:29 - and for the title I can set this equal
02:33 - to anything I want so for this first one
02:35 - I'll just say avatar so this is what's
02:38 - going to display right here now after
02:41 - this let me just go ahead and give it a
02:43 - genre so again these properties can be
02:47 - named anything you want title genre
02:49 - favorite food pudding
02:52 - whatever so um I'll say what is Avatar
02:55 - an action movie alright there you go so
02:58 - now what we did is we made this
02:59 - component and we passed in two
03:01 - properties a title property and genre
03:04 - property so now how do we say where to
03:07 - display them well you display them by
03:10 - writing it curly braces now any of your
03:13 - properties you can access through this
03:15 - dot props so if we want to access the
03:19 - title we write this dot props dot title
03:23 - whenever we want to access the genre
03:30 - great for this dot props dot genre just
03:35 - like that now if i refresh this check it
03:39 - out
03:40 - now it says avatar action so this is the
03:43 - coolest part about properties and I'll
03:47 - show you guys this right here actually
03:50 - it might be easier if I do this put it
03:52 - on a new line
03:55 - all right so say that we want to display
03:58 - three different movies we want it to
04:00 - display avatar and what's another
04:02 - movement the notebook and the genre of
04:05 - the notebook is romance and what's
04:08 - another room Captain America
04:12 - then what we can do is we can render
04:14 - three different components and each of
04:17 - these components have different
04:19 - properties so check this out
04:21 - every time I render one instead of just
04:24 - having some static text in here it
04:26 - actually gets the title of whatever the
04:30 - component is in the genre right here so
04:33 - again a property is essentially an HTML
04:35 - attribute that we can pass in to
04:39 - customize our components in different
04:41 - kinds of ways
04:42 - pretty awesome a nice I'll see you guys
04:45 - next time
