00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're gonna be
00:07 - taking another look at enumerations so
00:11 - let's go ahead and open up the projects
00:13 - from last time it is the one the sports
00:17 - analyzer that has the two list boxes and
00:20 - analyzed sport so what we're gonna learn
00:24 - in this tutorial is how to check and see
00:27 - if a certain value is defined in an
00:33 - enumeration so the way we do this is
00:36 - let's come out here to button analyse
00:38 - click we're going to add some code here
00:40 - so we're gonna declare a boolean value
00:43 - up here so we'll just type dim is define
00:51 - bool as boolean and we'll go ahead and
00:57 - set that equal to false and now what
01:00 - we're gonna do is let's say below this
01:06 - one we're going to we're going to show a
01:08 - message box and see if a certain
01:11 - enumeration value is defined so the way
01:14 - we do this is we're going to type well
01:19 - instead of assigning it down there let's
01:21 - go ahead and sign assign it up here so
01:23 - it's divine bool as boolean and we'll
01:25 - set that equal to system the system
01:29 - namespace dot enum the enumeration class
01:32 - dot is defined now is defined will take
01:39 - two arguments so the first one is the
01:43 - enumeration and the in the enumeration
01:46 - type so what we're going to do is we're
01:49 - going to type get type so it returns the
01:52 - system type object from the specified
01:54 - type name so we're just going to get the
01:56 - type of sports and now what we're gonna
02:00 - do is we are gonna put a value in so
02:03 - check to see if this value is defined so
02:06 - we'll just type in baseball
02:10 - and so this should give us a value of
02:14 - true so I'll just type message box dot
02:19 - show is defined bool dot to string okay
02:28 - so now if we go ahead and run this here
02:32 - is our program let's go ahead and pick a
02:36 - sport here we'll pick basketball click
02:38 - analyze sport and it says true let's see
02:45 - all the way hello
02:47 - let's pick baseball and it's true yeah
02:52 - so I'm sorry about that
02:54 - yeah it'll say true no matter which one
02:56 - you select because it's not checking
02:59 - what we've selected there so basically
03:03 - what it does is the system is I saw in
03:05 - them that is defined so it's the the
03:07 - function is defined or the method we
03:11 - pass the type of the sports enumeration
03:14 - into it by using get type and then we
03:17 - check to see if baseball is defined now
03:20 - if we do something like I let's do
03:23 - soccer so if we check to see if soccer
03:25 - is defined we can go ahead and pick
03:29 - anything in here it'll still give us the
03:31 - same answer each time click analyze
03:33 - sport and it gives us a value of false
03:36 - because soccer is not part of our an
03:39 - enumeration so um this is very simple
03:44 - you may not find a need for it at the
03:47 - moment
03:47 - but you probably will later on so it's a
03:51 - good thing to know
03:52 - and every time you learned something
03:54 - even if you not gonna use it right away
03:56 - it's always good to know it in case you
03:57 - need it so thanks for watching guys and
03:59 - stay tuned for the next tutorial
