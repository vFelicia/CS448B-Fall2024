00:00 - what's up guys bucky here and in this
00:02 - series
00:03 - we are going to be learning about docker
00:06 - now for those of you guys
00:07 - brand new to docker who aren't quite
00:10 - sure what it is
00:11 - or even when you would use it let's go
00:13 - ahead and imagine this
00:15 - so say it was your very first day
00:17 - starting in a new job
00:18 - you just got hired as a software
00:20 - developer and your boss
00:22 - slides you over the new company laptop
00:25 - and tells you to start installing all
00:27 - the dependencies that you're gonna need
00:29 - all right so let's go ahead and do this
00:30 - we're gonna install some python
00:32 - and uh what else do we got maybe uh
00:36 - postgres new database for sure and
00:39 - what's
00:40 - one more thing uh let's say django and
00:43 - what is this not compatible with version
00:46 - of
00:47 - postgres huh okay so it looks like
00:50 - we have to install a different version
00:52 - of postgres
00:54 - uh okay so you know things not going
00:57 - that well so far
00:58 - but let's just go ahead and install a
00:59 - different version so i'm going to
01:01 - install
01:01 - postgres v2
01:05 - and what is this uh postgres already
01:09 - installed oh crap okay
01:12 - so oh i know what if i installed with
01:14 - brew
01:15 - so install brew
01:18 - okay that's good and then brew install
01:22 - postgres okay now you have five postgres
01:26 - installed and nothing will work anymore
01:29 - okay
01:30 - so clearly things are
01:33 - not going that well i mean we already
01:36 - installed a bunch of different versions
01:38 - i'm reading through stack overflow posts
01:40 - and they're out of date and confusing
01:42 - and the cute girl sitting next to me
01:44 - thinks that i'm an idiot and it's not
01:45 - even lunch time yet
01:46 - now before we think about quitting and
01:48 - moving to canada so we never have to
01:50 - show our face at that company again
01:52 - let me tell you about a little something
01:55 - called
01:56 - docker now what is docker
02:00 - so docker makes it easy to install and
02:03 - run
02:03 - software without needing to manually
02:06 - install
02:06 - and configure a ton of dependencies so
02:09 - how does it do this
02:10 - it does this through something called
02:12 - containers
02:14 - now this is a very very simplified
02:16 - diagram of a container
02:18 - again in this first introductory video
02:20 - just want to give you the really high
02:21 - level concepts
02:23 - we'll be taking a deep dive into the
02:24 - container architecture
02:26 - later on and see exactly how it
02:28 - interacts with your
02:29 - operating system and hardware but again
02:32 - like i said
02:32 - very brief overview for now so let's get
02:35 - back to it
02:36 - what is a container a container is an
02:39 - environment
02:40 - that is isolated from the rest of your
02:42 - operating system
02:43 - so in this diagram right here this black
02:46 - laptop is your main
02:48 - laptop think of it like your work laptop
02:50 - and this green
02:51 - laptop is supposed to symbolize if you
02:53 - can't tell by my
02:55 - beautiful artwork an environment that's
02:58 - kind of
02:58 - isolated from the rest of your operating
03:00 - system now what do i mean by that
03:02 - isolated
03:03 - that means that within this container
03:05 - you can install
03:07 - any software you want you can actually
03:09 - delete any files you want
03:10 - mess with configurations do whatever you
03:14 - want in here
03:15 - and no matter what you do your parent
03:17 - operating system
03:18 - is never affected so unlike here where
03:22 - if you just have five different versions
03:23 - of postgres installed
03:25 - and your environment is all messed up
03:29 - you may have to like reboot or reinstall
03:31 - your entire operating system if things
03:33 - get really bad
03:34 - but with docker what you can do is
03:36 - essentially just
03:38 - delete this container and create a brand
03:40 - new one
03:41 - now some of the more tech savvy people
03:43 - out there may be noticing some
03:45 - similarities between
03:46 - docker containers and virtual machines
03:49 - and they do have a lot of similarities
03:51 - but some key
03:52 - differences as well now this website
03:55 - right here docker dot com slash
03:57 - resources slash what container
04:00 - is a good overview and actually has some
04:03 - pretty cool diagrams
04:04 - that uh i'm just gonna reference instead
04:06 - of trying to draw my own
04:08 - about the more of the specifics between
04:11 - a vm
04:12 - versus a container but real quick with a
04:15 - virtual machine
04:16 - you essentially have a separate mini
04:18 - operating system
04:20 - running within your operating system so
04:22 - this diagram on the right
04:24 - is reflective of an environment running
04:26 - multiple virtual machines
04:28 - so you see a b and c now you can see
04:30 - that each one of these is pretty much
04:32 - like a mini operating system which of
04:34 - course
04:35 - an operating system running within
04:37 - operating system
04:38 - is going to consume a lot of resources
04:40 - now containers
04:42 - they take up less space than a vm
04:44 - because they actually
04:45 - share the same operating system and
04:47 - hardware resources
04:49 - as the parent operating system alright
04:52 - so
04:52 - more on this later but for right now
04:54 - let's just head back to docker.com
04:57 - and we're going to install something
04:58 - called docker desktop
05:00 - so we are going to be using this
05:02 - throughout the duration of these
05:03 - tutorials so make sure that you follow
05:05 - along with this
05:06 - again docker.com if you go to products
05:09 - you can click
05:10 - on docker desktop and i'm going to hit
05:12 - download for mac because i'm on a mac
05:15 - and actually what i did is i downloaded
05:18 - it
05:18 - before this tutorial began because i
05:21 - figured you guys wouldn't want to you
05:22 - know just sit here and watch it download
05:24 - for
05:25 - however long it took so just gonna
05:28 - double click this
05:29 - all right now just drag it over in
05:32 - applications
05:34 - all right so apparently we got it
05:36 - installed but where is this thing well
05:38 - check it out
05:39 - open up your launchpad and click on this
05:41 - docker
05:42 - icon right here and okay
05:46 - yup i trust it it's cool it's cool and
05:48 - for
05:49 - this yes i do trust it
05:54 - and all right looks like we got
05:56 - something going on now another thing
05:58 - that i want to point out
05:59 - is in the top right corner right here
06:02 - throughout this tutorial you are going
06:04 - to need a
06:05 - docker hub account so let me pop this up
06:08 - so if you go to hub.docker.com
06:12 - you are going to need to sign up for one
06:14 - of these accounts create an id
06:15 - an email a password and very simply
06:18 - docker hub is
06:20 - more or less like github for docker
06:22 - there's a lot more to it than that but
06:23 - for right now just think of it like that
06:26 - so create an account and then once you
06:28 - do that
06:29 - if you right click this icon you can
06:31 - actually sign in
06:32 - with your docker id and this is just
06:35 - your docker help account
06:36 - alright so now that we have our docker
06:39 - hub account
06:40 - created and apparently we have
06:42 - everything installed
06:43 - the last thing we need to do in this
06:45 - tutorial is just verify that everything
06:47 - was installed and configured correctly
06:50 - so
06:50 - in your terminal whatever terminal
06:53 - you're using
06:54 - go ahead and write docker version and
06:56 - hit enter
06:57 - and if everything went smoothly then you
06:59 - shouldn't see any errors and you should
07:02 - see some output again we're going to be
07:04 - going over all this output in the
07:06 - following
07:07 - tutorials talking about the difference
07:09 - between the client
07:10 - and server yada yada tomato to motto but
07:13 - for right now
07:14 - all we want to do is ensure that we have
07:17 - everything set up
07:18 - installed and configured correctly now
07:20 - the last thing i want to point out
07:22 - before i let you guys go
07:24 - is if you run into any issues either in
07:26 - this video with the installation process
07:28 - or setting things up
07:30 - or in any future videos then what you
07:32 - can do
07:33 - is on the website the new boston.com
07:36 - social there is a discord link right
07:39 - here if you join our discord there's
07:41 - actually a docker channel that we have
07:43 - where we're going to be discussing
07:44 - everything docker related and helping
07:46 - anyone out
07:47 - with any issues at all and as a bonus if
07:50 - you want to follow these other
07:51 - sweet social media channels feel free to
07:54 - do so
07:55 - however now that we have everything
07:57 - installed and ready to go
07:58 - we are ready to take a closer look into
08:01 - containers
08:02 - and that is what we're going to be doing
08:03 - in the next video so ladies and
08:05 - gentlemen i will see you then
