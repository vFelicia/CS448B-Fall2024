00:00 - alrighty i'll welcome back to another
00:02 - tutorial and in this one we're going to
00:03 - be talking about loopering io
00:06 - so loopering io is loopering's own decks
00:10 - it's their own decentralized exchange
00:12 - built on top of their own loopering
00:14 - protocol now in layman's terms this is
00:16 - an app that lets users trade secure fast
00:20 - and cheap
00:21 - now before we just hop right into it i
00:23 - do want to point out a couple
00:25 - prerequisites that we're going to need
00:26 - to get started
00:27 - so first of all if you don't already i'm
00:29 - guessing like 99 of you probably do but
00:32 - if you don't go ahead and download
00:34 - metamask and if you need any help with
00:36 - this then check out my ethereum tutorial
00:38 - series where i make a tutorial going
00:40 - over all the features that we're going
00:42 - to need for metamask but either way make
00:44 - sure you have this and also you are
00:46 - going to need some ethereum because
00:48 - we're essentially going to be sending
00:50 - this
00:51 - to
00:52 - loopringslayer2dex this app right here
00:54 - so we can trade with it
00:56 - so once you have those two we can now go
00:58 - ahead and click this launch app button
01:01 - so this is going to take us to the user
01:03 - interface however before we can do
01:05 - anything the first thing that we need to
01:06 - do is connect our wallet and what this
01:09 - means is basically just allowing
01:11 - metamask to interact with the website so
01:14 - yes read all the terms and services and
01:16 - click meta mask alright so that was
01:18 - pretty easy got a little confirmation
01:20 - that it's connected right there
01:22 - so either way next thing that we need to
01:24 - do is we need to click this button
01:26 - deposit and activate layer 2. however
01:28 - before we go through this i do want to
01:30 - give you all a very brief overview of
01:32 - what's going on just so everyone isn't
01:34 - really like blindly following along got
01:36 - a little better understanding of what's
01:38 - happening here
01:39 - so either way
01:40 - right now and let me pop this back open
01:43 - right now
01:44 - all of my
01:45 - life savings this
01:48 - .0337 ether
01:50 - is on layer one ethereum's mainnet so
01:53 - let's pop this back open and check it
01:54 - out so here's my account and all of my
01:57 - ether like i said is on layer one now we
02:01 - need to get this over to loopring's
02:03 - layer two decks so that i can trade with
02:05 - it and we need to do this because
02:06 - remember this layer two protocol is
02:08 - essentially like a separate system
02:10 - that exists outside the main ethereum
02:12 - network
02:13 - so at this point in time if i were to
02:15 - ask ethereum what's my balance it would
02:17 - say this and if i were to ask loopering
02:19 - what's my balance loopering would say um
02:22 - wait who are you i have never heard of
02:24 - you before
02:25 - so not only do we not have any balance
02:28 - but loopering doesn't even have any idea
02:30 - that i intend to trade on their platform
02:32 - at all
02:33 - so whenever we go through that process
02:35 - of depositing and activating layer two
02:38 - essentially what we're gonna be doing is
02:40 - creating an account on loopering so that
02:42 - we can trade and technically for anyone
02:44 - out there what's happening behind the
02:46 - scenes is that
02:47 - this contract right here is receiving
02:50 - your assets and mapping them to a slot
02:52 - in the merkle tree which you control
02:54 - however that's not really important for
02:56 - this uh end user facing tutorial but i
02:59 - just want to point that out if anyone
03:00 - out there is a little bit more technical
03:02 - so go ahead and click this now now that
03:05 - we understand what's going on
03:07 - and just go ahead and click deposit
03:09 - and i have point zero three available so
03:12 - let me send point zero
03:16 - all right it's not let me type in point
03:18 - zero
03:21 - all right so
03:22 - it
03:24 - okay maybe some ui issues here but
03:26 - either way i needed to type in the three
03:28 - the three first and then uh go ahead and
03:30 - put the zero right there but either way
03:32 - go ahead and
03:34 - type in however many ether you want to
03:35 - transfer over to layer two now another
03:37 - thing that i want to point out is that
03:39 - since depositing is a layer one
03:41 - transaction it is going to cost a normal
03:43 - gas fee so just go ahead and make sure
03:45 - you leave some ether for the gas and now
03:48 - go ahead and click deposit
03:51 - and once we have metamask open to sign
03:54 - our transaction
03:56 - wow
03:57 - all right so guest fees are uh pretty
04:00 - expensive right now
04:01 - uh let's see estimated gas is 18 bucks
04:04 - wow this is pretty ridiculous okay so
04:07 - what i'm gonna do now is uh retry this
04:10 - process and i'm gonna do it with point
04:12 - two
04:13 - and this actually highlights the need
04:16 - for
04:17 - trading on layer 2 even though i'm going
04:19 - to have to pay a little extra gas here
04:21 - but either way click deposit and we'll
04:23 - see if it works this time
04:25 - all right have enough so go ahead and
04:27 - confirm this
04:29 - deposit submitted fantastic
04:32 - so once we deposited our funds the last
04:34 - thing that we're going to need to do is
04:36 - we're going to need to go up here where
04:37 - it says l2 wallet and then go ahead and
04:40 - click activate layer 2 activate account
04:43 - and activate account and once you do
04:46 - menomas is going to pop open you do need
04:48 - to sign another transaction pretty much
04:49 - authorizing your account activation go
04:51 - ahead and sign and send that
04:54 - and there you go
04:57 - all right fantastic so it looks like our
04:59 - funds have been deposited and account
05:02 - activated in other words account created
05:04 - on layer two and we are now ready to
05:06 - trade all right and i did go ahead and
05:08 - deposit some more funds just to make
05:10 - sure that i have enough to cover all of
05:12 - the features that we want to go over
05:14 - but either way now that we're loaded up
05:16 - go ahead and up in the top menu click
05:19 - trade and then simple
05:21 - and you're going to be taken to this ui
05:23 - and this is actually the first ui that
05:25 - we saw whenever we click launch app
05:27 - however now we're all loaded up
05:29 - everything is good to go ready to start
05:31 - trading
05:32 - so what i want to do is actually trade
05:34 - some of my ethereum and get some
05:36 - loopering
05:37 - so i'm going to say from
05:39 - ethereum
05:40 - i want to trade that for loopering and
05:42 - how much will i have 0.078 available
05:47 - so let's say about half of it so i'll
05:49 - say i'm going to trade .04 of my ether
05:52 - for loop ring gonna get about 142.
05:55 - now if this looks good just hit swap
06:01 - all right so
06:02 - that was pretty quick and apparently i
06:04 - have some loopering now and just to
06:06 - verify if you go back to your l2 wallet
06:09 - and you can now see since by default
06:12 - this takes you to your assets tab
06:14 - whatever you want to call it
06:15 - so if you scroll down you can see that
06:17 - okay i now have um this amount of ether
06:20 - remember i spent .04 on loopering and i
06:23 - now have 142 loopering fantastic
06:27 - and also another thing i want to point
06:28 - out is that if you ever just want to see
06:30 - your order history then on the left
06:32 - right here if you click on orders and
06:34 - then order history right here you can
06:36 - see that this order was basically just
06:39 - uh me trading ethereum for loop ring but
06:42 - either way just want to point out that
06:44 - this is where your order history is now
06:46 - another feature that i want to go over
06:48 - are these automated market maker pools
06:51 - and quick disclaimer i didn't want to
06:53 - make this a tutorial about automated
06:55 - market makers however some of the
06:58 - features that i do want to go over are a
07:00 - bit difficult to understand without a
07:01 - very basic understanding of what an
07:03 - automated market maker is
07:06 - so what we're going to be doing is
07:07 - taking about 30 seconds and figuring
07:09 - that out
07:10 - and more simply
07:12 - what we're going to be figuring out is
07:14 - whenever
07:15 - we just made that trade from ethereum to
07:18 - loop ring we're going to be figuring out
07:21 - how loopering io
07:23 - decided on this exchange rate right here
07:25 - for example whenever we trade this much
07:27 - ethereum for loopering how does it know
07:29 - to give us 138 why not 150 loop ring why
07:33 - not 130.
07:35 - so where does this exchange rate come
07:37 - from well check it out so
07:40 - behind the scenes and by behind the
07:42 - scenes i mean abstracted away in a smart
07:44 - contract somewhere
07:46 - but behind the scenes
07:48 - bloopering controls two big pools of
07:51 - assets
07:52 - and in this case we're going to be
07:54 - taking a look at the ethereum pool and
07:55 - also the loopering pool now in short the
07:58 - amount of assets in each one of these
08:00 - pools determines the supply and demand
08:03 - and by that i mean the less of something
08:06 - there is the greater the price so
08:08 - whenever we traded our ethereum for
08:10 - loopering what we were essentially doing
08:13 - is saying yes there is some ethereum in
08:16 - my account i don't want it anymore or
08:19 - not that you don't want it just that
08:20 - you're trading it for something else so
08:22 - i'm gonna take that ethereum it's gonna
08:24 - leave my account and it's going to go
08:26 - into this ethereum pool so now this
08:29 - ethereum pool now has more ethereum in
08:31 - it
08:32 - and in exchange for that what we did is
08:34 - we said
08:35 - what we want
08:37 - in return is loopering so from this
08:40 - loopering pool we actually removed some
08:43 - loopering for that so as a result of
08:45 - this trade there is now less loopering
08:48 - or in other words a lower supply in this
08:50 - pool and therefore for the next user who
08:53 - makes this trade the price of loopering
08:55 - is going to go up for them and of course
08:56 - it's a bit more complicated than that
08:58 - there are lots of fancy algorithms and
09:00 - formulas involved but the point is for
09:03 - this trading system to work we rely on a
09:06 - pool of both of these assets in these
09:08 - assets come from users so now the
09:11 - question is why would a user
09:13 - ever want to lock up their assets into a
09:16 - loopering dex
09:17 - well in exchange for allowing loopering
09:20 - io to use those assets liquidity
09:22 - providers in other words the people who
09:25 - allow loopring to use their assets they
09:27 - earn fees from the trades in those pools
09:29 - that they provide liquidity to now if
09:32 - all this sounds overly complicated then
09:34 - it could all be summed up in short to
09:36 - say you can let loopering io borrow your
09:39 - assets and you can earn fees from it
09:41 - that's really all that's happening here
09:43 - so how does this work well if you click
09:46 - on this pools tab right here you're
09:47 - going to be taken to a list of these
09:49 - automated market maker pools
09:51 - and you can essentially just decide
09:53 - which one you want to contribute to
09:56 - so
09:57 - to become a liquidity provider what you
09:59 - need to do is you need to deposit an
10:01 - equal value of both assets to these
10:04 - pools
10:05 - so let's say i want to contribute to
10:07 - this liquidity pool where loopering in
10:10 - ethereum is being exchanged
10:12 - so i'm just going to go ahead and click
10:14 - add right here
10:15 - and you are going to be taking to this
10:17 - page where you can add liquidity to the
10:20 - pool
10:20 - so like i said you need to add an equal
10:23 - amount of loopering and ethereum an
10:26 - equal amount of both assets and the
10:28 - reason for that is because if you would
10:29 - only add one then it would actually um
10:33 - kind of adjust the price and that's not
10:34 - what we're trying to do just add some
10:36 - more liquidity for the trading system to
10:38 - work
10:39 - so
10:40 - i'm going to go ahead and add 200
10:42 - loopering and at the current exchange
10:44 - rate that's this much ethereum and just
10:46 - go ahead and hit add liquidity
10:51 - all right look like it worked
10:53 - so what just happened is we took some of
10:56 - our loop ring in some of our ethereum
10:58 - and we essentially let loop ring io hold
11:00 - on to it or borrow it
11:02 - now in exchange for that what we
11:04 - received is something called an lp token
11:07 - or a liquidity provider token it says
11:09 - liquidity token right here it all means
11:12 - the same thing
11:13 - so this liquidity token
11:16 - is more or less like our iou or our
11:18 - receipt for those coins and what we can
11:21 - do is we can actually if we ever want to
11:24 - um kind of return this and get our
11:26 - tokens back in other words get our loop
11:28 - ring and ethereum back
11:30 - then we can essentially convert this
11:32 - token
11:33 - for
11:34 - these two assets so of course you can
11:37 - see your balance of your liquidity token
11:39 - here and also if you go to l2 wallet and
11:43 - click on my liquidity on the left then
11:45 - you can also see your total position
11:47 - value and also the fee rewards earned
11:49 - from providing liquidity right here now
11:52 - if you ever want to remove it from the
11:53 - pool then you can go ahead and click
11:55 - this and by the way just a heads up if
11:57 - you want to get there from this ui then
12:00 - if you just go back here and click this
12:02 - little tab right at the top then it's
12:05 - going to take you to the same place but
12:07 - this is how you would essentially do the
12:09 - opposite of that transaction where
12:11 - you're taking your liquidity tokens and
12:14 - redeeming them back for
12:16 - that loopering and ethereum
12:18 - so
12:18 - you pretty simple ui you pretty much
12:20 - just say what percentage
12:23 - do you want to redeem and we'll just say
12:25 - 50
12:26 - and just say remove liquidity and again
12:29 - what this does is it converts those
12:30 - liquidity tokens and we should now have
12:33 - received loopering and ethereum and if
12:35 - we go back to our l2 wallet and look at
12:37 - liquidity yes it looks like it did go
12:40 - down
12:41 - and
12:42 - are right there are our two assets we
12:45 - actually have three assets our loopering
12:47 - ethereum in that this is that lp or
12:50 - liquidity provider token as well now
12:53 - there are two other things that i just
12:55 - want to touch on real quick before i let
12:57 - you guys go and the first one is just
12:59 - using the order book
13:01 - now
13:02 - i will mention this that this simple
13:04 - interface is more than just the
13:07 - interface this trading system is using
13:10 - an automated market maker and we just
13:12 - talked about all that
13:13 - this professional
13:15 - order book model this is not using the
13:17 - automated mark maker this is your
13:19 - typical order book this is going to
13:21 - allow you to place limit trades or
13:23 - market trades limit trades of course
13:25 - being
13:26 - basically a trade where you say this is
13:27 - the price that i want to trade for and
13:29 - you kind of wait and see if someone else
13:31 - is going to come along and take the
13:33 - other side of that trade
13:34 - market trade is basically a simple trade
13:37 - saying whatever the price the current
13:39 - price is then i'll just trade for that
13:40 - price right now but either way just want
13:42 - to point out that there are some more
13:44 - professional tools for the more
13:45 - experienced traders
13:47 - and the last thing that i wanted to
13:49 - cover in this tutorial is just how to
13:51 - take those funds from this layer to
13:54 - wallet and move them back to layer one
13:57 - so what we're going to do is we're going
13:58 - to click withdraw right here
14:01 - and it's gonna ask for an ethereum
14:03 - address and by the way this address it
14:06 - doesn't have to be the same one where
14:09 - you deposited those funds from this can
14:11 - be an entirely new ethereum account it
14:13 - can you know
14:15 - it doesn't even have to be known by
14:16 - lubering at all you can essentially put
14:18 - any layer one ethereum address in here
14:21 - and you're going to be able to deposit
14:22 - to that
14:23 - so just to verify that everything is
14:25 - working let's go ahead and withdraw
14:28 - we'll say
14:30 - oh five
14:32 - and what is my metamask account all
14:36 - right so take note here i currently have
14:39 - .0161 in my ethereum wallet
14:42 - and all right that looks good
14:46 - are you sure you want to withdraw if so
14:48 - just go ahead and sign this
14:51 - all right looks good
14:53 - all right so that was pretty easy
14:56 - and after somewhere between five and 30
14:58 - minutes you should see those funds
15:00 - appear back in your main layer one
15:02 - wallet
15:03 - so yes withdrawals do take a little bit
15:05 - of time and that is because we are
15:07 - required to interact with layer one
15:09 - however i mean hey that's why we love
15:12 - layer two right
15:13 - so on that note thank you for watching
15:15 - don't forget to subscribe and i will see
15:17 - y'all in the next video
