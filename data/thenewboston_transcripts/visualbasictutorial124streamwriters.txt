00:00 - hello YouTube say I'm here from
00:02 - youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
00:04 - new Boston and this tutorial we're going
00:07 - to be talking about streams now
00:09 - basically what a stream is is it's the
00:12 - what you used to exchange data between
00:15 - files memory or maybe a network so you
00:20 - can send bytes of data back and forth so
00:23 - what we're gonna do in this tutorial is
00:25 - write some types to a text file so we'll
00:29 - go ahead and click new project we will
00:33 - select windows forms application and we
00:37 - will call it streams okay so let's go
00:46 - ahead and make this resize it a little
00:49 - bit so we'll add a text box and we will
00:53 - make it multi-line by clicking the arrow
00:55 - and selecting multi-line so now we can
00:58 - drag this out and make it a little bit
00:59 - bigger let's come up here and add a
01:02 - button now we'll set the text of this
01:06 - button to right and we'll set the name
01:10 - to button right and we'll set the name
01:16 - of textbox1
01:17 - to text too right so now let's go ahead
01:21 - and double-click on right to create an
01:24 - event handler for that
01:25 - so we'll just zoom in some here now what
01:29 - we need to do is create a stream Rider
01:32 - so we can write to a text file so we'll
01:35 - come up here and to be able to do that
01:37 - we need to type in imports system dot IO
01:43 - and IO stands for input/output so it
01:48 - will create any new stream writer now so
01:51 - we'll type private my writer as new
01:58 - stream writer and for the arguments
02:02 - we're gonna need a path so I'll just do
02:04 - it in my G Drive and I'll call the file
02:08 - my file dot txt
02:12 - so it's gonna look for this file and if
02:15 - it doesn't find it then it's just gonna
02:16 - create it for you so now what we're
02:18 - gonna do is let's take the text that the
02:21 - user typed in or whatever they could
02:22 - click write you know go ahead and write
02:26 - that to the text file so we will type my
02:32 - writer dot write line which is similar
02:36 - to the console apps that we learned
02:38 - close to the beginning of the series so
02:40 - we're gonna write line and we're gonna
02:42 - write whatever is in the text box so
02:44 - text to write dot txt so it's gonna
02:48 - write that to the text file now there's
02:51 - one problem with this if we go ahead and
02:53 - click right and it'll write that to the
02:55 - text file if we try to open that text
02:57 - file you're not gonna see any changes
02:58 - made to it because in order for the
03:00 - changes to take place we're gonna have
03:02 - to close that file so let's move this
03:04 - button over here a little bit we'll add
03:07 - another button and we'll set the text to
03:10 - close file I'll set the name to button
03:15 - close so whatever they click close file
03:19 - and they're finished writing we'll just
03:21 - go ahead and type my writer dot close so
03:26 - this will close the file and all of our
03:28 - changes will take effect now we'll go
03:30 - ahead and open up my G Drive and you can
03:33 - see that there is no text file in here
03:35 - right now we'll go ahead and minimize
03:37 - that now if we run this it creates that
03:43 - text file so you can see that it created
03:47 - my file right here and currently it
03:49 - doesn't have anything in it you can see
03:52 - that right there so we'll close out of
03:54 - that will minimize this so that's just
03:57 - write hello world we can write that to
04:01 - it and we could also have it clear this
04:04 - text box every time we click write just
04:06 - to make it a little bit more
04:07 - user-friendly then we'll say just on
04:11 - live gamer we'll write that and you can
04:15 - see that whenever we write it doesn't
04:17 - actually save the changes to our text
04:18 - document so in order to save the changes
04:21 - we have to click close file now
04:25 - if we come over here and open up my file
04:29 - we get looks like we get hello world and
04:34 - on live camera so we could change this
04:41 - to say file that would look a little bit
04:43 - better but that's just something that
04:45 - you can do so basically we just made a
04:48 - streamwriter and it access to this file
04:51 - right here and since it wasn't there it
04:53 - created it and then we wrote whatever
04:55 - was in the text box to it and then when
04:56 - they're done working with it we click
04:58 - close so that it will say the changes to
05:00 - that file so go ahead practice with some
05:03 - stream riders then once you done that go
05:05 - ahead and move on to the next tutorial
