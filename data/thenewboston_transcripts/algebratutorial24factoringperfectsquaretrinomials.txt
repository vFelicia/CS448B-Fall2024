00:01 - So today we're going to talk about
00:04 - factoring perfect square
00:07 - trinomials so a perfect square trinomial
00:11 - will be written in this
00:13 - form a s plus or minus 2 a b + b^ 2 and
00:21 - if a trinomial comes in this form
00:24 - whenever you go to factor it all you
00:26 - have to do is a plus plus or minus b^ 2
00:32 - now this plus or minus in the
00:34 - parentheses depends on whether this is a
00:37 - plus 2ab or a minus
00:40 - 2ab so for this example x^2 - 14x + 49
00:47 - we have to make sure that X is a perfect
00:50 - square which it
00:52 - is 49 is a perfect square which is 7
00:58 - squared and that this can be written as
01:02 - 2 a which is 1 B which is 7 well 2 * 7
01:08 - is
01:09 - 14 so that means when we write our
01:12 - perfect
01:14 - square we're going to take a which is
01:18 - the square root of
01:20 - x and then plus or minus but since this
01:23 - is a -14 x it's going to be
01:28 - minus and then B B which is
01:32 - 7
01:38 - squared so when we go to factor it this
01:41 - way we have to make sure that it fits
01:43 - that
01:46 - formula and if it does you're always
01:48 - going to have a single quantity
01:52 - squared so is this a perfect square well
01:57 - the square root of 49 is 7 and the
01:59 - square root of x is x 1 the Square < t
02:04 - of 1 is 1 and is this equal to is
02:10 - -14 x
02:12 - = to
02:14 - 2 a which is
02:18 - 7 7 x and B which is
02:22 - 1 well NE
02:25 - -4x is
02:27 - equal to 14
02:33 - 14x so that means it is a perfect square
02:36 - trinomial so when we go to factor it we
02:39 - take a which we already found was 7
02:43 - X plus or minus but since this is a
02:46 - -14 it's going to be minus and then B
02:50 - the square root of B which is
02:53 - 1 squared and if you want to check
02:57 - this remember that when we have a
02:59 - quantity s we have to foil it
03:03 - out 49
03:06 - x^2 - 7 x - 7 x +
03:13 - 1 and that is the same thing as up
03:19 - here so we're going to do one more
03:21 - example with factoring perfect square
03:23 - trinomials they're pretty easy because
03:26 - all you have to do is recognize them and
03:29 - remember the little formula that tells
03:32 - you how to
03:33 - factor
03:36 - so we have to make sure that this is a
03:39 - perfect square and this is a perfect
03:41 - square so the square root of 25 is five
03:45 - the square root of x^2 is
03:47 - x the square < TK of 36 is 6 and now we
03:52 - have to say is this
03:54 - equal to 2
03:58 - a *
04:01 - 60x is = 2 * 5 x is 10 x * 6 is 60 x so
04:08 - yes that does work so now we take a
04:12 - which is
04:14 - 5X plus our minus but since this is a
04:17 - positive 60 in the middle it's going to
04:19 - be plus the square < TK of b^2 which is
04:23 - 6
04:25 - squared so like I said that's all we're
04:27 - doing with perfect square trinomials
04:29 - make sure you come back and watch the
04:31 - next lesson where we're going to learn
04:33 - how to factor normal trinomials that
04:36 - don't follow a special rule
