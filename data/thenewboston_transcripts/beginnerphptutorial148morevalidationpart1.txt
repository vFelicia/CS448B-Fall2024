00:00 - hi this is alex from phpacademy.org back
00:02 - with another video for the new boston
00:05 - now in the user system we have completed
00:07 - everything and we have
00:09 - sorted out the form validation now
00:11 - there's a few points that we need to
00:12 - address before we
00:14 - continue any further let's just go back
00:17 - to our code and have a look and then
00:18 - we're going to run the web page
00:20 - so we can see what the output of
00:23 - everything is
00:25 - okay so at the moment we have our form
00:29 - form here which is actually reoccurring
00:32 - our data that's already been submitted
00:34 - in the form
00:35 - which is fair enough so when the user
00:37 - submits a username let's say alex
00:40 - a password which we're not saving just
00:42 - for security reasons
00:44 - um and then a first name let's say alex
00:47 - and then garrett
00:48 - now what happens if they haven't
00:50 - submitted this data
00:52 - we're just echoing it out as a variable
00:54 - so we're just echoing our
00:55 - username and then we're just echoing out
00:58 - first name
00:59 - and then just surname we're not saying
01:02 - has this data being submitted or not
01:05 - and we also have another issue in let's
01:07 - just open
01:10 - core.inc.php we've got this http
01:14 - referrer here
01:15 - now obviously the http referrer is going
01:18 - to give us the page that we were
01:19 - referred from
01:21 - so therefore if we were to open up um
01:26 - our page and we were to go over to the
01:29 - register.php file
01:31 - just php you can see that we are given
01:34 - a variety of errors
01:38 - now the error at the top is to do the
01:39 - http referral it gives us an
01:41 - undefined indexed error an undefined
01:44 - index error
01:45 - and what this means is that we have this
01:48 - variable here
01:49 - equal to an undefined index this has not
01:52 - been defined anywhere
01:54 - because we haven't been referred from
01:56 - anywhere if we had say
01:58 - a link on index.php
02:01 - and we were linking to this register
02:03 - page then
02:04 - we would be able to um would be able to
02:08 - uh have a referral a referrer
02:10 - information would be sent so how do we
02:13 - go and
02:14 - solve this problem well it's quite
02:16 - simple all we need to do
02:18 - is we need to come down a bit and we
02:20 - need to use an if statement
02:22 - to check if this here is already set
02:24 - before we define it
02:26 - so let's just come up here and we'll say
02:28 - if
02:30 - is set much like when we were doing the
02:32 - form validation on the register.php page
02:35 - dollar underscore server
02:38 - and then http referrer so we're doing
02:42 - exactly the same thing
02:43 - we're just saying is it set is it has
02:45 - this been set
02:48 - then we wrap that in the block um we
02:51 - could also say
02:52 - um and not
02:56 - empty
03:01 - http referrer
03:04 - just for added peace of mind i guess
03:06 - it's this part here isn't important
03:09 - necessarily but it just means is it set
03:12 - and is it not empty remember we're using
03:14 - the exclamation mark for not
03:16 - then we set the variable so we only set
03:19 - this variable
03:20 - here if we perform these checks
03:23 - correctly and this block is run
03:24 - so therefore we're not going to receive
03:26 - an undefined index error
03:28 - because we're not setting a variable to
03:30 - something that doesn't exist
03:31 - because these checks up here do the
03:33 - existence check for us
03:35 - so let's go back and refresh
03:38 - okay can you can see that that error is
03:40 - gone let's go back to the index page
03:41 - that
03:42 - court is included in as well and you'll
03:44 - see that the error's gone as well
03:46 - so we've solved part of our problem now
03:48 - you've probably noticed back on
03:50 - register.php we've got exactly the same
03:52 - error message
03:53 - we've got here notice undefined variable
03:56 - username in and then it will tell us all
03:59 - about the information
04:00 - this is a php error but because we've
04:02 - echoed it out
04:04 - let's just go down because we've echoed
04:08 - out in the value
04:09 - property of our input type here or our
04:12 - input field
04:14 - it's given it to us with its html data
04:17 - we've got the same here as well notice
04:19 - undefined variable first name
04:22 - notice undefined variable surname so how
04:25 - do we go about doing this well we say
04:27 - the exact same process applies to this
04:30 - code here
04:31 - um then we've just changed
04:35 - this here so what we need to do is we
04:37 - need to say
04:39 - if and then we start a block so the
04:42 - block the
04:43 - the if the block if the um condition is
04:46 - true
04:47 - we're executing or running rather this
04:49 - block here
04:50 - so if is set
04:54 - um username echo that
04:58 - and then that's it that solved our
05:00 - problem so if
05:01 - is set username then echo username
05:04 - otherwise don't
05:05 - and we can't but the and doesn't equal
05:08 - it is not
05:08 - empty but it's not terribly important
05:10 - for now so let's refresh
05:13 - and you can see that that's disappeared
05:14 - from there so we've solved that one now
05:16 - let's just go down and correct the
05:18 - others
05:18 - so we're using inline php here we're
05:21 - saying if
05:22 - and then we're oh no sorry i've missed
05:24 - the echo there
05:28 - so we put that echo back in the right
05:30 - place there um
05:32 - then we need to obviously close our
05:33 - block so
05:35 - again if is set
05:40 - first name so the the type of error you
05:44 - you see you just need to look at it
05:45 - carefully and think undefined variable
05:48 - we have an
05:48 - undefined variable now why might it be
05:51 - that we have undefined surname
05:53 - just look through your code just examine
05:55 - your code and see what's happening
05:58 - obviously we haven't submitted the form
06:00 - so we've
06:01 - uh we've created these variables for
06:03 - ourself
06:04 - to be able to use username password now
06:07 - that we're using these
06:08 - this username first name and surname
06:11 - what it's doing is it's grabbing data
06:12 - from post that hasn't actually been
06:14 - submitted
06:15 - we're not posting the first name when we
06:17 - just land on register.php so we need to
06:20 - incorporate checks that deal with errors
06:22 - like this because the last thing you
06:24 - want to do is to be uh
06:26 - is to be dealing with um or showing
06:28 - these errors to your users
