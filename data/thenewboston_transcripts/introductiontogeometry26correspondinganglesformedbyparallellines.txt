00:00 - So today we're going to talk about
00:02 - corresponding angles formed by parallel
00:05 - lines and it's going to and these angles
00:08 - are going to help us solve some triangle
00:10 - problems later on so when you have two
00:13 - or more parallel lines right
00:16 - here as you know we denote that with
00:19 - these little
00:21 - arrows that are cut by a transversal
00:24 - which is this line which we're going to
00:26 - call line
00:28 - T corresponding angles are
00:31 - congruent so like this
00:35 - angle of this line and this transversal
00:39 - is congruent to this angle of this
00:42 - second line and this same
00:45 - transversal just like this one right
00:50 - here is
00:52 - congruent to
00:56 - here and the same goes for the angle on
01:00 - this
01:01 - side
01:03 - so this
01:06 - angle is congruent to this
01:09 - angle and this
01:11 - angle is congruent to this
01:15 - angle so knowing
01:18 - that we need to find the measure of
01:20 - angle one and angle two so these are the
01:23 - two parallel lines so their
01:25 - corresponding parts are congruent so
01:29 - like we said before
01:31 - the measure of angle
01:33 - one since angle one is congruent to this
01:37 - angle right here has to be
01:40 - 106 because congruent angles have equal
01:45 - measure and angle two is congruent to
01:48 - this angle right
01:50 - here so angle two has to measure
01:58 - 74° Okay so so our directions are to
02:01 - find the missing angle
02:04 - measurements okay so we want angle one
02:07 - and angle two so these lines
02:11 - are
02:13 - um parallel and these lines are
02:18 - parallel so there's a couple ways we
02:22 - can find out these angle measures we're
02:25 - going to do both of them so first if you
02:28 - look at these two parallel
02:30 - lines this one and this one we'll call
02:33 - this one a this one b and this one's C
02:36 - and this one's
02:38 - D so if you look at this one the these
02:42 - lines are cut by this
02:45 - transversal so that means that
02:47 - corresponding angles have to be
02:50 - congruent so this
02:52 - angle between line on line a and line C
02:58 - is congruent to this angle right
03:02 - here line B on line
03:05 - C so we can find out that the measure of
03:09 - angle 1 is 87° just using that or what
03:15 - we could
03:16 - do
03:18 - is
03:20 - since these two angles are
03:23 - supplementary we could set 93 plus we'll
03:27 - call this x right here
03:30 - equal to
03:32 - 180 and if you subtract that over you
03:34 - find out that this angle rate here
03:39 - equals
03:43 - 87° and since these two parallel
03:48 - lines C and D are cut by this
03:51 - transversal line a that means that this
03:55 - line or this angle is congruent to this
03:58 - angle so one would have to
04:02 - equal 87 as well so those are just two
04:07 - different ways you can do
04:09 - it and you can do the same thing to find
04:12 - the measure of angle two you can look at
04:15 - it as these two
04:18 - lines are parallel and they're cut by
04:21 - this transversal D so this angle has to
04:27 - be congruent to this angle angle so the
04:31 - measure of angle 2 has to equal
04:34 - 93° or like we did with the other one
04:38 - you can
04:39 - say
04:41 - that these two are
04:44 - supplementary so you set 87 plus we'll
04:49 - call this y = to 180 if you subtract it
04:52 - over you get yal
04:54 - 93 and since these two parallel lines C
04:59 - and D are cut by this transversal
05:03 - B
05:06 - this
05:10 - line has to be or this angle has to be
05:13 - congruent with this
05:15 - angle
05:17 - so measure of angle two has to be
05:20 - 93 so either way you do it you'll get
05:23 - the right answer it's
05:26 - just one way might be a little quicker
05:29 - than the other
05:33 - so again we are told to find the missing
05:36 - angle
05:40 - measurements so we're going to start by
05:43 - finding the measure of angle 16 so if
05:46 - you look this
05:51 - line this line a and this line B are
05:55 - parallel and right here they're cut by
05:58 - this transversal
06:00 - G to form angle
06:03 - 16 so this angle has to be
06:08 - congruent to this angle so the measure
06:11 - of angle 16 has to equal
06:19 - 120 so to find the measure of angle 17
06:22 - we have to do a little something a
06:23 - little
06:24 - different so first we have to find out
06:27 - what the measure of this angle X right
06:29 - here
06:31 - is and then this these two angles are
06:33 - supplementary angles so we can find out
06:35 - the measure of 17 from there so since
06:40 - these two angles are supplementary we
06:42 - can add 120 + x set it equal to
06:47 - 180 subtract the 120 over and we get X
06:50 - is equal to
06:51 - 60 so then these two
06:54 - angles are also
06:57 - supplementary so we
07:00 - set one or sorry 60 +
07:05 - 17 well plus angle 17 is equal to
07:10 - 180 we get angle 17 is equal to
07:20 - 120 and to find
07:23 - 18 you can look at it as these two lines
07:27 - b and a are parallel they're cut by this
07:30 - transversal
07:33 - Z so this
07:36 - angle has to be
07:40 - congruent to this angle so the measure
07:44 - of 18 has to be
07:49 - 120° so we learned about transverse
07:52 - angles today and how they're
07:54 - congruent but next lesson we're going to
07:57 - go into other kinds of angles formed by
07:59 - parallel lines so make sure you come
08:01 - back and watch that
