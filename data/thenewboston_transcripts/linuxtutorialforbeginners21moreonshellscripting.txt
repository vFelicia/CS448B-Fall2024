00:00 - all right guys in this video I just want
00:02 - to show you a few other things that you
00:04 - can do with shell scripting and I don't
00:06 - want to get real in detailed because
00:08 - again this series is just for Linux and
00:11 - shell scripting there is a lot to cover
00:13 - so for now I just want to give you guys
00:15 - the basics and show you guys that shell
00:16 - scripts do exist and you know just a
00:18 - couple cool things that you can do with
00:20 - it so if you guys are familiar with
00:22 - programming you probably know about if
00:25 - then else statements and you know all
00:27 - that good stuff so if you want to use if
00:30 - statement in Shell scripting then what
00:32 - you do is you can do this and I'll also
00:35 - show you guys how to use parameters
00:37 - which is that other optional information
00:39 - that you can use whenever you're running
00:41 - commands so for the first parameter I'll
00:44 - just check if it's equal to like a hot
00:46 - dog
00:48 - whatever and then if you write then on
00:51 - the next line if the parameter equals
00:54 - hot dog then we can just you know do
00:56 - whatever we want to do like you um type
00:59 - hot hot
01:00 - [Music]
01:02 - dog now you can also add an else
01:05 - condition and for this else condition
01:07 - you can just say Echo out
01:11 - um uh I don't know this is going to be
01:14 - the dumbest thing ever like
01:16 - uh you did not type hot dog and we can
01:22 - actually use that parameter again so
01:24 - whatever they typed we can get that
01:26 - information from them so I'll just Echo
01:30 - something like it was and this is
01:33 - actually kind of weird how you use
01:37 - them uh dollar sign one so that's how
01:41 - we're going to interpret it now at the
01:43 - end just write fi so make sure you save
01:47 - it and I know I'm going over all of this
01:50 - real quick but again I just want to give
01:52 - you guys a real uh basic overview of
01:54 - this not go into anything in
01:57 - Real uh you know grave detail so
02:00 - bash Bucky let's just go ahead and add
02:02 - hot dog first and it's going to say you
02:05 - typed hot dog now since we added that
02:07 - else condition we can type anything else
02:09 - like tunafish hit enter and it says you
02:13 - did not type hot dog it was tuna fish so
02:16 - this is a really simple explanation of
02:18 - how you can get your shell script to
02:20 - make some really basic decisions now
02:23 - there's also I'll just show you guys the
02:26 - last thing um Loops since any like even
02:30 - simple programming demonstration I feel
02:32 - the need to cover Loops so I'll say
02:34 - something like for string I'll say for X
02:38 - in uh like uh dog cat
02:44 - fish
02:46 - and I'll just write do
02:49 - Echo X so at the end of this I'm just
02:53 - going to write down and this is just
02:54 - going to Loop through this so in this
03:00 - series dog cat and fish and actually I
03:03 - can't use cat because that um so I'll
03:07 - write um like I don't know
03:12 - elephant like it was that hard to think
03:14 - of an animal all right so for this
03:16 - series right here it's going to Loop
03:19 - through each one and tree each element
03:21 - as X now for each of those elements it's
03:23 - just going to print it out on the screen
03:25 - and the reason that I couldn't use cat
03:27 - because remember whenever we use cat
03:29 - it's a keyword that's built into Linux
03:31 - for displaying stuff on the screen so we
03:33 - can't use built-in
03:34 - keywords or it'll throw it and remember
03:38 - to save it
03:40 - again and Bash Bucky boom roasted dog
03:44 - elephant fish so that is your really
03:47 - like the shortest tutorial on shell
03:50 - scripts that you have probably ever
03:52 - watched but that's the basics of it
03:53 - that's what you can do with it and in
03:55 - the next video I'm going to show you a
03:57 - much better way to automate Linux Comm F
04:00 - and that is through the use of python I
04:02 - cannot wait I will see you guys then
