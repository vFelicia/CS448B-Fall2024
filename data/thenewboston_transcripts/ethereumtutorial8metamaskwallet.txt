00:00 - all right everyone welcome back to
00:02 - another video and in this one we are
00:04 - finally gonna be getting our hands dirty
00:06 - downloading our first ethereum wallet
00:09 - we're gonna be using metamask in this
00:11 - one but before we get to that let's go
00:13 - ahead and talk about what wallets are
00:15 - just a refresher in case anyone's not
00:16 - familiar
00:18 - so wallets are basically software that
00:20 - allow users to connect to the ethereum
00:23 - network
00:24 - and also they allow you to do a couple
00:27 - different things once you're connected
00:28 - create new ethereum accounts view your
00:30 - transaction history of course send ether
00:33 - to other people other accounts so we're
00:34 - going to be taking a look at all of that
00:36 - now another thing i want to mention real
00:38 - quick before we hop in is that there are
00:40 - different types of wallets we're going
00:41 - to be using a browser wallet which is
00:43 - essentially just an extension that we
00:45 - can use from our browser
00:47 - there are also desktop wallets that you
00:49 - can download and install right on your
00:51 - desktop there are mobile wallets for
00:53 - your phone of course web wallets if you
00:55 - go to coinbase.com it's kind of a wallet
00:58 - embedded in their platform
01:00 - so lots of different types but like i
01:02 - said we are going to be downloading and
01:04 - using one called metamask so to do that
01:06 - let's go ahead and get started
01:08 - if you go to chrome apps or really if
01:11 - you type in a metamask download it's
01:14 - probably going to be the first thing
01:15 - that pops up but this is also easy way
01:17 - to get to it where if you go to your
01:18 - chrome apps click on web store and then
01:21 - the best bet is probably just to type in
01:24 - metamask and there you go
01:26 - so an ethereum wallet in your browser
01:28 - looking good
01:30 - and all right uh fantastic fantastic
01:33 - just go ahead and click add to chrome
01:35 - right there
01:36 - and it can do this okay looks good
01:42 - all right so if you don't see it
01:43 - stickied up in this top right area what
01:45 - you can do is click on this little
01:47 - puzzle piece and next to metamask if you
01:49 - click this pin then what it does is it
01:52 - pins it to this little area right here
01:54 - so there you go
01:55 - now let's see what we got pretty cool
01:57 - animation right here welcome to metamask
02:00 - connecting you to ethereum and the
02:01 - decentralized web we're happy to see you
02:04 - okay let's go ahead and get started
02:06 - all right so
02:07 - no we don't have one yet this is our
02:09 - first time setting it up so i'm gonna
02:10 - click yes let's
02:12 - set this up and create a wallet okay
02:16 - so
02:17 - metamask is this this i agree all right
02:20 - so so far pretty simple asking you to
02:22 - set a password to protect your account
02:24 - all right uh
02:26 - definitely read that just gonna go ahead
02:28 - and hit create
02:31 - and all right so uh real quick i wanna
02:33 - point out that this is actually a really
02:35 - cool video to watch but i'm going to
02:37 - click next because i'm going to explain
02:39 - to you in a bit exactly what this secret
02:42 - recovery phrase is which we're going to
02:44 - talk about in the video i'm going to
02:45 - explain what it's all about so let me go
02:47 - ahead and click next
02:49 - and all right so let's read this real
02:51 - quick
02:52 - so your secret recovery phrase makes it
02:54 - easy to back up and restore your account
02:56 - never disclose it to anyone okay so
02:58 - what's going on here i'm gonna click
03:01 - this to uncover 12 words so what the
03:05 - heck are these so check this out you
03:07 - know a couple tutorials ago it might
03:10 - have been like the second or third one
03:11 - we were talking about accounts and the
03:13 - difference between a private key and a
03:15 - public key and an account number
03:17 - and we pretty much said that you need a
03:19 - private key to really create a public
03:22 - key and an account number you really
03:23 - need a private key to do anything on
03:25 - ethereum
03:26 - so
03:27 - we took a look at the private key and it
03:29 - looked like a big hexadecimal number so
03:32 - what are these these look like you know
03:34 - english words so what does this have to
03:37 - do with our private key
03:39 - so check it out
03:40 - a private key is really nothing more
03:43 - than a big long number now you'll often
03:46 - see it in hexadecimal form but even
03:48 - hexadecimal form can be broken down to
03:50 - just a big huge integer basically
03:53 - now of course for humans these huge
03:56 - integers are very very difficult to
03:58 - remember in even the shorter hexadecimal
04:01 - form
04:02 - so instead
04:03 - what this is is something called a
04:05 - mnemonic it's essentially a list of
04:08 - words
04:09 - and each of these words is going to be
04:11 - related to a given integer or a number
04:14 - and when you combine all of these words
04:16 - together it essentially allows you to
04:19 - have a human
04:20 - a pretty much uh way that humans can
04:23 - more easily remember
04:25 - very long numbers
04:26 - so with that being said i want to save
04:29 - that this right here and i'm going to
04:31 - copy and paste it right next to me
04:33 - actually since i'm going to need it in
04:34 - just a bit so again each of these words
04:37 - is actually mapped to a big number in
04:40 - the pretty much the background of this
04:41 - app and when you combine all of those in
04:43 - a certain order it's essentially going
04:46 - to map out to your private key so that
04:48 - said you never want to share this
04:51 - mnemonic or the secret recovery phrase
04:53 - with anyone so go ahead and write it
04:55 - down
04:56 - uh hide it somewhere where no one's
04:58 - gonna find it
04:59 - never send it through email or anything
05:01 - like that and this is gonna be used if
05:03 - you ever you know your laptop ever
05:05 - crashes or your imac whatever you're
05:07 - using
05:08 - uh beefs out then what you could do is
05:10 - you can always recover your account
05:12 - using this phrase
05:14 - okay so let me just go ahead and click
05:16 - next and
05:17 - what this screen is right here is it
05:19 - basically just make sure that you wrote
05:21 - down your secret recovery phrase
05:23 - somewhere
05:24 - so it asks you to pretty much just build
05:26 - it again
05:27 - so mine was frequent uh what was it mean
05:31 - tackle height
05:33 - upon
05:42 - steak quote mushroom all right confirm
05:46 - and beautiful
05:48 - okay so it says yada yada boom you're
05:51 - all good to go i'm gonna click all done
05:53 - and all right don't really care about
05:55 - what's new
05:57 - for the time being
05:58 - all right looking good now one quick
06:00 - thing that i want to point out before
06:01 - you even get to poking around in here
06:04 - and that is whenever you are you know
06:06 - just using your browser going and
06:08 - browsing different websites or uh not on
06:11 - this ui and you want to access your
06:13 - wallet then what you can do is you can
06:15 - click this little icon right here and
06:18 - this is gonna pop up of course if you
06:20 - ever want to get back to that bigger ui
06:22 - then what you can do is you can just
06:23 - click expand view
06:25 - but essentially what i
06:27 - pretty much just want to convey here is
06:29 - that this
06:30 - user interface is the exact same as this
06:32 - one it's just um you know i'm using the
06:35 - expanded view just because it's easier
06:37 - to teach with a little bit bigger area
06:40 - so that let me go ahead and zoom in a
06:42 - bit and okay let's start poking around
06:44 - now the first thing i want to point out
06:45 - is this right here which is your account
06:47 - number
06:48 - so if you want to copy this and you know
06:50 - send it to your friends your family and
06:52 - say hey send me some ether then you can
06:53 - just go ahead and copy that email it to
06:56 - them and that's what they're going to
06:57 - use
06:58 - and of course moving on from there
07:00 - another key thing to kind of point out
07:02 - right here
07:04 - is that this drop down right here
07:06 - whenever you click it you're gonna see
07:08 - okay there's one item in here says
07:10 - ethereum mainnet so what this means is
07:12 - we're connected to the main ethereum
07:15 - network the ethereum mainnet is like the
07:17 - network it's the actual ethereum network
07:20 - where your ether is actually worth
07:22 - real money
07:23 - now there is this option right here that
07:25 - says show hide test networks so let's go
07:28 - ahead and click that and okay let me
07:30 - just toggle this on and now let's scroll
07:33 - up and we can actually close out of this
07:36 - so now that we toggled that on let me
07:38 - click this drop down again
07:40 - huh this is this is interesting so of
07:42 - course we are still connected to the
07:44 - ethereum main net but now we have these
07:46 - different options
07:48 - so what are these robson coven
07:50 - rink b i'm not even going to try to
07:52 - pronounce that never do and uh localhost
07:55 - so in addition to the main ethereum
07:58 - network there are also other ethereum
08:00 - networks for testing development and so
08:02 - on
08:03 - and of course on these networks your
08:06 - ether isn't worth anything and we're
08:08 - actually going to be connecting to these
08:09 - networks later on whenever we develop
08:11 - these smart contracts and we want to
08:13 - test them
08:14 - and the reason for that is to be able to
08:16 - deploy and test your smart contracts it
08:19 - does require ether
08:21 - now if we do it on the main network
08:23 - because the transaction fees are pretty
08:25 - high right now it's going to be very
08:27 - expensive for development so what we
08:28 - want to do is we want to use a test
08:30 - network
08:31 - and essentially just use that because
08:34 - well we can get ether for free more or
08:36 - less and it isn't worth anything so it's
08:39 - uh pretty much just a great testing
08:40 - environment so that being said let me go
08:42 - ahead and actually connect to the rink b
08:45 - test network right here now another
08:47 - thing that i want to point out is i
08:48 - don't know if you saw my account number
08:50 - right here so it starts with 3ba and it
08:52 - ends with seven eight eight
08:55 - so i'm on rink b right now let me go
08:57 - ahead and switch to ethereum
08:59 - okay same account number robson same
09:02 - account number all right so this is
09:03 - pretty interesting it looks like even
09:06 - though i'm switching networks my account
09:08 - is staying the same
09:10 - so
09:11 - what's going on here
09:13 - so check this out
09:14 - whenever you have an ethereum account
09:18 - it's basically just a record
09:20 - on that network now the record can have
09:24 - different assets depending on which
09:26 - network it's on
09:28 - so for example let's say that this was
09:30 - the main ethereum network right here
09:33 - so for my account i can just well even
09:35 - now i have zero ethereum on the main
09:38 - network
09:39 - now whenever i connect to a different
09:42 - network a development network and i
09:44 - start getting ether for that
09:46 - this network right here it knows nothing
09:49 - about this network
09:50 - in other words the rink b test network
09:53 - has
09:54 - no idea what's going on in the ethereum
09:56 - main network it has no idea it exists it
09:59 - really is completely
10:01 - isolated from a completely different
10:02 - environment so again i just want to
10:05 - point out that you can indeed use the
10:08 - same account across multiple different
10:11 - ethereum networks let's say that this is
10:13 - the main one this is a development one
10:15 - and this is just another one used for
10:17 - testing so it is fine to use the same
10:19 - account across multiple different
10:21 - networks just know that for each one
10:23 - your account is essentially going to
10:26 - have its own independent set of assets
10:28 - or ether
10:29 - so that being said again make sure that
10:31 - you're connected to the rink b test
10:33 - network and the first thing that we need
10:35 - to do before we can start developing
10:37 - smart contracts writing solidity is we
10:39 - need to get some ether
10:41 - now remember this is an actual ether in
10:44 - other words we can just go to some
10:46 - exchange and buy some and send it to our
10:47 - account but we actually want test ether
10:50 - so the ether that we get for this
10:51 - network it's not going to be worth
10:53 - anything we're not going to be able to
10:54 - sell it anywhere but we do need it
10:56 - because since we are going to be using
10:58 - this development network we just need
11:01 - ether to be able to send transactions
11:02 - deploy smart contracts so on and so
11:04 - forth okay so we need ether but where do
11:07 - we get it
11:08 - so this is
11:10 - well it's probably one of the less
11:12 - standard things since uh these seem to
11:14 - change quite often but there are these
11:16 - services called faucets
11:18 - and they essentially allow you to do
11:20 - something simple like paste in your
11:22 - account address or make a tweet or
11:23 - something and then they send you some
11:24 - ether now since these change so often
11:27 - your best bet is likely just to go to
11:29 - google and type in rink b faucet so i
11:32 - just did that just to make sure i had a
11:34 - working one and the first one i used
11:37 - actually didn't even work for this
11:38 - tutorial so i went to this one
11:40 - now
11:41 - again these are pretty simple to use uh
11:43 - what you can do in this case is just
11:45 - make sure you have your account number
11:47 - handy so go back to your metamask wallet
11:49 - and just click copy to clipboard
11:51 - now in here
11:52 - uh what network do we want yes we want
11:54 - rink b that looks good gonna paste in my
11:57 - account
11:58 - and i'm also gonna uncheck this we don't
12:00 - need any link we just need some ether
12:02 - for testing
12:04 - i'm not a robot well past that okay
12:07 - and now send a request
12:09 - so check it out
12:11 - and okay waiting for confirmation may
12:14 - take about i don't know 15 20 seconds or
12:17 - so
12:18 - and now it says request complete so
12:20 - let's go ahead and close this and pop
12:23 - back to metamask
12:25 - and now
12:26 - there you go
12:28 - so you can see i now have
12:31 - 0.1 ether in my account again this is
12:35 - you can call it fake ether it's rink b
12:37 - ether but either way good to go
12:40 - now just a couple
12:42 - other items that i want to point out on
12:43 - this ui the first thing
12:45 - is this activity tab right here so the
12:48 - activity is essentially going to show
12:50 - you your transaction history so again
12:53 - the default view is this assets tab so
12:55 - if you click on activity you can see
12:57 - that we only have one transaction right
12:59 - now and that is from the ether that we
13:01 - just received and there are a few other
13:03 - elements to this ui most of them we're
13:05 - just going to be covering as needed
13:07 - again i don't want to go over all of the
13:09 - individual details
13:11 - account settings right now i don't think
13:12 - it's really necessary or beneficial at
13:15 - this time but i do want to point out
13:17 - some simple things of course
13:19 - one of the most often is probably the
13:20 - send
13:21 - pretty simple ui you click send and then
13:24 - you can paste in an account number
13:26 - and then if you have multiple assets you
13:28 - can select between but you pretty much
13:30 - just uh
13:31 - specify the amount and then yeah pretty
13:34 - simple ui you click next and confirm and
13:37 - then if it's all confirmed it'll show up
13:39 - in your transaction history yada yada
13:41 - tomato's motto and before i let you go i
13:43 - do want to actually point out one other
13:45 - thing and that's how to create an
13:46 - additional account and we're going to be
13:48 - touching on this point in the future as
13:50 - well
13:50 - but i know in the earlier tutorials i
13:53 - mentioned that whenever you have a
13:55 - private key you can derive the public
13:57 - key from it and then from that you can
13:59 - come up with the account number now
14:01 - there are other wallet types called
14:03 - deterministic wallets and what these
14:06 - allow you to do is essentially create
14:08 - multiple accounts from the same private
14:11 - key and hopefully we can get in a little
14:14 - bit later exactly how that works but i
14:16 - just want to point out now because we
14:18 - are going to be creating multiple
14:19 - accounts and we only ever had that one
14:22 - private key which remember that was our
14:24 - secret recovery phrase but just want to
14:26 - point out in case that was uh confusing
14:28 - for anyone so i'm going to go ahead and
14:30 - create an account and let me just say
14:32 - that uh
14:33 - bucky
14:36 - personal or whatever it doesn't really
14:37 - matter the name this isn't stored on the
14:39 - ethereum network it's kind of just for
14:41 - local organization
14:43 - so go ahead and hit create and there you
14:45 - go so that is how you can have multiple
14:48 - accounts within the same network and
14:50 - again this is useful you know maybe
14:52 - you're developing something and you just
14:54 - want to
14:54 - send some ether between two different
14:56 - accounts or send some different type of
14:58 - assets
14:59 - but there you go that is the basics of
15:02 - metamask how you get some sample ether
15:05 - and on that note i believe that we are
15:06 - now ready to start developing smart
15:09 - contracts so i i'm looking forward to it
15:12 - thank you for watching don't forget to
15:14 - subscribe and i'll see y'all next video
