00:00 - what is going on guys welcome to your
00:02 - 18th UDK tutorial and in this tutorial
00:04 - I'm gonna be going over something called
00:06 - at surface properties so during the
00:08 - break what I did is I used the default
00:11 - materials that we had built into UDK to
00:14 - apply all the materials I needed to to
00:17 - my house so now my house is covered with
00:19 - the materials the roof all the walls the
00:22 - floor etc etc so let me say this for the
00:26 - record whenever we're building the
00:28 - models in the future whenever we learn
00:30 - to create our own materials I'm gonna be
00:33 - using you know nice siding for the walls
00:35 - and you know maybe a nice tiled roof and
00:39 - maybe a nice concrete and carpet floor
00:41 - but for now these are the materials that
00:43 - we have to work with so our models may
00:46 - look a little funny because you know we
00:47 - have to use like a metal and these weird
00:49 - materials but just stick with me for now
00:52 - we're just learning the basics for now
00:53 - so basically what I want to be talking
00:56 - to you guys about surface properties now
00:59 - if we go ahead and fly in our house we
01:02 - can see that alright whenever we apply a
01:05 - material it kind of sets up the material
01:07 - by default the size of the material how
01:09 - it's placed on our walls but there are a
01:11 - couple things that we may want to change
01:13 - specifically how it's aligned and maybe
01:17 - we want to rotate it or something like
01:18 - that
01:19 - well in order to adjust the details of
01:22 - our surface we need to adjust surface
01:24 - properties so let's first and foremost
01:26 - take a look at this you see how this
01:29 - floor kind of doesn't align with this
01:32 - piece right here and if we go ahead even
01:34 - though these are the same surfaces or
01:36 - excuse me the same materials the tiles
01:39 - aren't really aligning and it doesn't
01:41 - really look really pretty so let's go
01:43 - ahead and fix that first and foremost so
01:46 - in order to open up your surface
01:48 - properties window go ahead and hit view
01:51 - and then you see an option for surface
01:53 - properties or you can go ahead and hit
01:55 - f5 and no pop-up so now with this
01:58 - selected you can go ahead and adjust all
02:00 - the properties of the surface so for
02:03 - example if we want to align all these
02:05 - floors what we can do is we can hold
02:07 - ctrl to select this one and this one and
02:10 - in order to align them all
02:13 - let me go ahead and zoom in on this and
02:15 - look what happens whenever I hit a line
02:18 - go ahead and hit planner or planner
02:20 - however a heck you say it and this
02:22 - pretty much means Allina in the same
02:25 - plane so go ahead and take an O of this
02:27 - piece right here I'm gonna hit apply and
02:29 - everything snaps into perfect alignment
02:32 - so now this piece is lined with this
02:35 - piece and also this piece is aligned
02:38 - with this piece so again any time you
02:40 - want to lie align the same material type
02:43 - just go ahead and select all that
02:45 - material and hit planar alignment and
02:48 - hit apply pretty cool huh
02:50 - so now that that's line we're gonna
02:53 - notice a few more things first of all
02:55 - whenever we tiled this floor whoever we
02:58 - hired didn't do a very good job because
03:00 - we want this tile right here to bob up
03:02 - against the wall exactly as you notice
03:05 - it's kind of getting cut off and it's
03:07 - like half the tile is being the line
03:09 - with the floor and we really don't want
03:10 - that so what we can do is we can use
03:13 - this pan property and we probably want
03:16 - to make sure all of our surfaces are
03:17 - selected and pan them all at once so go
03:19 - ahead and control control and now let's
03:22 - go ahead to his corner and pan them
03:24 - appropriately
03:25 - so what pan means is pretty much move
03:28 - they probably should just named it move
03:30 - but hey if I was making it I would have
03:32 - done it so the U and V pretty much means
03:35 - horizontal is U and vertical is V is
03:38 - just two different directions so go
03:40 - ahead and if we want to pan this four
03:42 - units vertically or excuse me
03:44 - horizontally go ahead and hit a four
03:46 - four four or four until we get exactly
03:48 - but it up against the wall now say we
03:51 - hit 16 by accident and we want to go
03:54 - back in order to move it in the reverse
03:56 - direction just go ahead and hold shift
03:58 - on your keyboard and now while holding
04:01 - it shift it pans in the reverse
04:02 - direction so go ahead and make that but
04:05 - up against the wall directly and that
04:08 - looks pretty good right there and now
04:10 - I'm going to be the doing the same thing
04:11 - with V so go ahead and have four
04:15 - and one and there we go so now our tile
04:20 - is butted up against the wall exactly
04:22 - how we want it to so using the pan what
04:25 - we can do is we can move the material
04:27 - and using the alignment we could align
04:30 - up the material simple enough so now our
04:33 - floor is looking pretty good I think
04:35 - I'll leave it at that
04:36 - so now let's go ahead and move on to the
04:39 - roof and I'll teach you guys about some
04:41 - more surface properties so as you can
04:43 - see as my roof material I chose this
04:46 - kind of weird looking I was going for
04:49 - kind of a metal roof design look and
04:51 - this was the closest thing I had to it
04:53 - so let's go ahead and notice a few
04:55 - things first of all this material right
04:58 - here and this material right there is
05:00 - actually the same material and you might
05:02 - be kind of confused at first because
05:04 - this material doesn't look like it has
05:06 - those metal strips on it while this one
05:08 - does well let's go ahead and fix that
05:10 - right now and get everything aligned go
05:12 - ahead and select this one and hold
05:14 - control just select that and if I Phi
05:16 - over on this side I'm actually going to
05:18 - do the same thing hold control so now I
05:21 - have my entire roof selected and don't
05:24 - forget all of those are the same
05:25 - material so let me go ahead and get a
05:27 - good angle for what I'm about to show
05:29 - you guys the very first thing I want to
05:32 - do is make sure everything's aligned so
05:34 - I'm gonna go to planar align and hit
05:36 - apply now you can see a little bit of
05:38 - change but it really doesn't solve my
05:40 - problem of having these metal strips
05:43 - aligned with these metal strips so what
05:45 - I'm gonna do is even though everything
05:47 - is aligned it's rotated in a different
05:50 - direction this is rotated horizontally
05:52 - and this is rotated vertically pretty
05:54 - much so go ahead and select this one and
05:57 - also go ahead and hold down control and
06:00 - select this one and if I go ahead and
06:02 - hit rotation and 90 degrees everything
06:05 - is gonna line up nice and neat
06:06 - so that sort of rotation comes in handy
06:08 - you can rotate different materials
06:10 - depending on how you want it so I'm
06:13 - gonna go ahead and actually I have two
06:15 - more things to do I want to fix this
06:17 - roof great right here
06:20 - and I also want to mess with the inside
06:24 - walls a little bit right here so what
06:26 - I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna be
06:28 - saving that for the next tutorial so
06:30 - thank you guys for watching and I'll see
06:31 - you guys in the next video
