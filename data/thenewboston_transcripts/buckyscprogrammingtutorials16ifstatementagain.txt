00:00 - what is going on guys welcome back to
00:02 - your sixteenth C++ tutorial and in this
00:04 - lesson I want to talk to you guys about
00:06 - something called the if statement now
00:08 - the if statement is basically a simple
00:11 - way to have your computer program make a
00:13 - very simple decision so before when we
00:17 - were programming we built simple
00:18 - programs and it pretty much just ran
00:20 - line after line after line of code
00:23 - without question so that's nice and all
00:26 - but sometimes you want to have your
00:28 - computer program make a simple choice
00:30 - for example you might have some code
00:32 - that you only want to run sometimes and
00:35 - you're saying all right why would I even
00:36 - put it in there if I only want to run it
00:38 - sometimes well for example if you're
00:40 - making a website and you had a message
00:44 - on there that said hello Bucky well you
00:46 - would only want to show that message
00:48 - whenever I logged in you wouldn't want
00:51 - to show it whenever a guy named Tommy
00:53 - loggin or a girl named Jessica logged in
00:55 - so you would say if the user is Bucky
00:58 - then say hello Bucky so you can see that
01:01 - unlike before when you just built a
01:04 - program in your granite from top to
01:05 - bottom now we have different routes
01:08 - different choices that our computer
01:10 - program can make and the basic basic
01:13 - decision that each computer can make is
01:16 - made using the if statement so the
01:19 - syntax for the if statement is
01:20 - incredibly simple you go ahead and type
01:23 - the keyword if and in between
01:25 - parentheses right after you're going to
01:27 - give it a test now go ahead and add
01:30 - curly brackets and if that test is true
01:33 - then it's going to run the code whatever
01:35 - you put in here if it's not true then
01:38 - it's not going to run the code so you're
01:40 - going to say all right um the test is is
01:43 - the user Bucky and the code would be say
01:46 - hello Bucky on the screen or something
01:48 - like that so that's basic example but of
01:51 - course that isn't real code so let's go
01:53 - ahead and make a real program that
01:54 - actually works so the basic what people
01:58 - typically do is they have a variable
02:01 - first of all so let's go ahead
02:03 - make int X and set it equal to 10 so now
02:06 - we have a variable equal to 10 they
02:08 - might want to test this to see um is
02:11 - this variable equal to 10 so go ahead
02:16 - and say if X and now in order to make
02:19 - these simple tests we use something
02:21 - called comparison operators and when
02:23 - you're testing numbers there are six
02:26 - different ways you can compare numbers I
02:28 - know you think is equal or not equal but
02:30 - there's a lot more first of all you can
02:32 - test is X equal to 10 is X not equal to
02:37 - 10 is X less than 10 greater than 10
02:40 - less than or equal to or greater than or
02:42 - equal to let's go ahead and test it
02:44 - besides something other than 10 so we
02:47 - know X is equal to 10 if we want to test
02:50 - if it's the same as 10 we go ahead and
02:53 - write equal equal 10 and you're saying
02:56 - all right first of all slow down this
02:58 - doesn't make sense why would you not
03:00 - just write if x equals 10 because that
03:03 - makes sense
03:03 - well the single equal sign is they
03:07 - already reserved that for setting a
03:09 - value equal to the variable so if you
03:12 - did this right here it would think that
03:14 - you're trying to set X equal to 10 and
03:16 - your program is not going to work right
03:17 - so that's why whenever you're comparing
03:20 - a variable and value you need that
03:23 - double equal sign so this means all
03:25 - right test if X is equal to 10 and if it
03:29 - is let's just go ahead and give
03:30 - something stupid C out um OMG IM pritty
03:36 - that means pregnant and ghetto talk so
03:39 - let's go ahead and NL and let's go ahead
03:43 - and run this and see what happens build
03:44 - and run and on the screen that says OMG
03:47 - I am
03:48 - Bragi and why did it do this because we
03:51 - had a variable X and it was equal to 10
03:54 - and then we said all right if X is equal
03:57 - to 10 then go ahead and print this out
03:59 - on the screen and it was so print it out
04:01 - but if you had something like if X is
04:04 - equal to you know 87 now we try and
04:07 - build and run it you see that our
04:08 - computer program didn't print it out
04:10 - because 10 is not equal to 87 so you're
04:14 - saying all right
04:15 - I know how to test whether a value is
04:17 - equal to a variable but what if I want
04:20 - to test if they're not equal I want to
04:22 - make sure that these values are not
04:23 - equal well the sign for that is a
04:26 - explanation point equal sign this means
04:29 - all right if X is not equal to 87 print
04:33 - this out and it's going to print it out
04:34 - because it's 10 equal to 87 no that
04:38 - doesn't even make sense so it's going to
04:39 - go ahead and print that out so that's
04:41 - why we get oMG I am per Iggy
04:44 - so aside from that let me go over the
04:47 - basics less-than and greater-than if X
04:49 - is less than 87 is 10 less than 87 yes
04:54 - and by the way whenever we have a test
04:57 - and that test is true we say true
05:00 - whenever the test is wrong we say false
05:03 - so it's 10 less than 87 yes 10 is less
05:08 - than 87 so we call this test true and
05:11 - it's since it's true it goes ahead and
05:13 - prints it out oMG I am praying now let's
05:18 - go ahead and be like is 10 greater than
05:21 - 87 No
05:22 - 10 is not greater than 87 so that's why
05:25 - it didn't print it out right there so
05:27 - aside from that there are two other
05:29 - simple ones I want to go over with you
05:31 - guys there is less than or equal to so
05:35 - if you add something like is 10 less
05:38 - than 10 and you just had a basic less
05:40 - time then you try to run it and it
05:43 - wouldn't work because 10 is not less
05:45 - than 10 10 is the same as 10 well what
05:48 - if you want to test the value is less
05:50 - than or equal to another variable well
05:53 - we go ahead and we have our variable 10
05:55 - is it less than 10 nope or is it equal
05:58 - to 10 yes
05:59 - so this is indeed going to print out oMG
06:03 - I am braggy and of course there is
06:06 - greater than or equal to but I'm not
06:07 - even going to show you example because
06:09 - it's pretty self-explanatory what we
06:11 - have so aside from testing a variable
06:15 - against a value I just want to tell you
06:17 - guys that you can go ahead
06:19 - and test two variables such as 43 so now
06:24 - we're going to say all right is X arm
06:28 - greater than or equal to Y aka is 10
06:32 - greater than or equal to 43 let's go
06:35 - ahead and go and run that and we see
06:37 - that 10 is not greater and it's not
06:39 - equal to 43 so we can test two variables
06:43 - and we can even test two numbers like is
06:47 - five greater or equal to three
06:50 - and we go ahead and run that and we
06:54 - print out oMG I am pretty but this
06:56 - testing two values is the least common
06:59 - thing people I don't want to say always
07:01 - but I've never seen it where people had
07:03 - two values in here it's either one
07:06 - variable or two variables if we go ahead
07:09 - and we just had this code right here
07:10 - then it wouldn't make sense just to
07:12 - forget this whole if statement just like
07:15 - that unless you don't know how to
07:16 - compare numbers then you would have a
07:18 - problem then you shouldn't be watching
07:19 - this story but for now I just wanted to
07:22 - talk to you guys about the if statement
07:23 - and how we can use it to make a basic
07:25 - decision again technical terms whenever
07:29 - your test is positive we call that a
07:32 - true test whenever your test is negative
07:35 - and it doesn't make sense we call that
07:37 - false so the code inside the if block is
07:40 - only going to run when your test is true
07:42 - as you just saw and again we have two
07:44 - equal signs for equals explanation point
07:47 - equals means not equals greater than
07:50 - less than greater than equal to less
07:51 - than or equal to so now you are pro with
07:54 - the if statement so thank you guys for
07:55 - watching don't forget to subscribe and
07:57 - yeah see you next story
