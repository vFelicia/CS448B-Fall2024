00:00 - so today we're gonna start talking about
00:04 - logic and geometry is the most logical
00:10 - math it's very systematic and there's
00:13 - always a reason for everything you do so
00:16 - a huge part of geometry is these if-then
00:19 - statements and they allow us to do a lot
00:24 - of our proving of things so a
00:29 - conditional is a statement is a
00:38 - statement that follows this pattern if P
00:46 - and P is just an action then Q and Q is
00:54 - just another action so for an example if
00:59 - it rains then soccer practice will get
01:04 - canceled where you have one statement P
01:09 - that implies another statement Q so the
01:15 - conditional that you're given is always
01:18 - true we're gonna talk about some other
01:20 - kinds of statements that are not always
01:23 - they're not necessarily always true okay
01:27 - and one of those is called the converse
01:31 - where you take the two statements and
01:35 - you flip them so if Q then P so if
01:41 - soccer practice is canceled
01:43 - then it rained where you're saying that
01:46 - instead of P implying Q you have a Q
01:51 - implies P so if you look at this one if
01:56 - soccer practice is canceled
01:59 - then it rained that's assuming that the
02:03 - only time soccer practice is canceled is
02:05 - when it rains if there's not school like
02:10 - if there's a snow day or something
02:11 - soccer practice is going to be
02:13 - cancelled too that's why this statement
02:15 - isn't always true for certain statement
02:19 - for certain if-then statements it could
02:21 - be true but we can't say with certainty
02:25 - that it is true so now we're going to
02:29 - talk about another statement called the
02:32 - inverse where you take the opposite of
02:35 - the first action and then and say that
02:39 - if not P then not Q and this little
02:43 - symbol right here means you negate it
02:47 - which is which just means when you put
02:50 - not in front of P you're negating the
02:53 - action so if it is not raining then
02:58 - soccer soccer practice is not canceled
03:01 - so not P implies not Q but this you have
03:09 - to be careful with because like the
03:11 - converse the inverse is not always true
03:15 - because think about it if it is not
03:17 - raining then soccer practice is not
03:19 - canceled well didn't we just say that
03:22 - there could be other reasons soccer
03:24 - practices cancelled it doesn't always
03:26 - have to be when it's raining it just
03:29 - says that if it does rain soccer
03:32 - practice is canceled so we can't just
03:36 - simply switch we can't negate each one
03:40 - and say it's true so a last one and this
03:44 - is the only statement other than the
03:46 - conditional you're given that is always
03:48 - true so if not Q then not P so the
03:55 - contrapositive is really just taking the
03:58 - converse and taking the inverse and
04:01 - doing it at the same time because we're
04:04 - going to switch the order of the two
04:06 - actions and we're going to negate them
04:10 - with the not statements so if soccer
04:13 - practice I should say practice
04:20 - if soccer practice is not canceled that
04:24 - it is not raining where we have not q
04:28 - that implies not P so think about if we
04:33 - were gonna state this a different way we
04:38 - it would just it would just say that if
04:40 - soccer practice is if they are having
04:45 - soccer practice then it's not raining
04:47 - which makes sense because our original
04:49 - conditional said that if it rains they
04:54 - will not have a soccer practice so this
04:58 - is the only statement where it's true so
05:03 - it's really important to remember this
05:05 - one because this there's contrapositive
05:07 - of some of our theorems that we have
05:10 - learned it's gonna help us solve some
05:12 - proofs later on so that's all we're
05:15 - gonna do with logic but as promised our
05:18 - next lesson is gonna deal with more
05:20 - proofs so make sure to come back and
05:22 - watch that
