00:00 - what is going on guys welcome to your
00:01 - 16th you decayed soil and in this story
00:04 - I'm gonna be going over something called
00:06 - the content browser so what we need to
00:08 - do next with our level is we need to add
00:11 - some materials to this house because
00:12 - unless you're a huge fan of chess or
00:15 - checkers you probably don't want these
00:16 - purple and gray boxes covering your
00:19 - house you probably want to apply it with
00:20 - some nice looking pretty material spice
00:23 - things up a bit make it a little more
00:24 - interesting looking so in order to do
00:27 - that we need to apply materials to this
00:30 - house and in order to access our library
00:32 - of materials we need to go up here and
00:34 - open something called the content
00:36 - browser so go ahead and hit this low
00:39 - black button and now your content
00:41 - browser is gonna pop up now I'm gonna
00:44 - take the rest of this tutorial just to
00:46 - go over the basics of this content
00:48 - browser I'm not going to be going over
00:49 - every little radio button in checkbox in
00:52 - all these different packages but what
00:54 - I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna be
00:56 - giving you the $2 tour of the content
00:58 - browser so basically what the content
01:01 - browser is is it's basically a big
01:03 - search engine for example whenever we
01:07 - start making advanced games we're gonna
01:09 - have a bunch of different textures and a
01:12 - bunch of different models for example
01:13 - we're gonna have models of trees and
01:15 - guns and cars and we're gonna have a
01:17 - bunch of sound effects like gunshots and
01:20 - you know car engines and people
01:22 - screaming and this is where everything
01:24 - gets organized any asset that we make in
01:28 - an external program such as like
01:29 - Photoshop and 3d max or maybe some sound
01:32 - program we can search for that in this
01:35 - right here so basically let's start with
01:37 - the left hand side on the left hand side
01:40 - is where we can basically tell our
01:43 - content browser where to look for the
01:45 - stuff we're looking for for example
01:47 - everything in the UDK gets stored in
01:50 - packages so we can either look for those
01:53 - specific packages right here or and by
01:56 - the way a package is just like a folder
01:58 - basically so as you expand these you can
02:01 - see that everything is just stored in
02:03 - folders and subfolders and yada yada
02:06 - yada so basically if we want to look in
02:08 - a specific package or folder we can
02:10 - expand it
02:11 - or what we can do is this is what we're
02:13 - gonna be doing generally just go ahead
02:15 - and hit all assets and that's gonna
02:17 - allow us to look through all of the
02:18 - folders or packages now these different
02:21 - collections is your shared collections
02:24 - is pretty much if you're working on a
02:25 - project as a team you can share your
02:28 - favorite collections pretty much this is
02:30 - pretty much my favorites so this is your
02:33 - shared favorites and if you want to have
02:35 - your personal favorites you can make
02:36 - your very own collection right here I'm
02:39 - not going to be going over that because
02:40 - we got other more important stuff to
02:41 - cover so in order to minimize this if
02:45 - you don't want look at that anymore you
02:46 - can also hit this arrow and that'll hide
02:48 - it from the view but for now I'll just
02:51 - keep it open for you know the tutorials
02:53 - sake now let's hop over to the
02:55 - right-hand side and this is your tags
02:57 - section now you can create new tags and
03:00 - straw tags but basically a tag is just a
03:03 - keyword so if you want to apply tags to
03:06 - some of these materials like you want to
03:08 - apply the building tag to any materials
03:10 - that you can use on a building that's
03:12 - what you would do so again just like
03:14 - this packages section you can minimize
03:16 - this if you don't want it or maximize it
03:18 - now the top here actually I'll get to
03:22 - the top later because that's the part we
03:23 - use most often but the bottom here is if
03:26 - I just go ahead and minimize this this
03:28 - is how you can set up your content
03:31 - browser in different views by default
03:33 - it's in the thumbnail thumbnail view
03:35 - excuse me but you can also switch it to
03:38 - list view and to split views horizontal
03:41 - or vertical
03:41 - I like the thumbnail view the most
03:43 - that's what I recommend using now right
03:46 - here is your zoom if you want to zoom in
03:48 - for example if you really want to scroll
03:50 - when you're looking at textures or
03:52 - something here's how you can do that but
03:54 - by default again I like to reset that
03:56 - leave it at a hundred percent now right
03:59 - here is your default thumbnail size so
04:02 - say you're saying alright my thumbnails
04:04 - are way too big when they're 128 so I'm
04:07 - gonna go ahead and change it down to 64
04:08 - it may make searching for your
04:11 - thumbnails a little bit easier but by
04:12 - the way I basically like to leave
04:14 - everything in default because they set
04:16 - it up default is a reason they thought
04:17 - it was the easiest and I think it's the
04:19 - easiest - so that's basically the basics
04:22 - of how you can set up your view if
04:24 - you really don't like anything how they
04:26 - have a setup by default so now let's go
04:29 - ahead and hop to this top section this
04:31 - top section is pretty much your browser
04:33 - or search engine it allows you to search
04:36 - for any materials any textures model
04:40 - sounds it basically is a really advanced
04:43 - search engine and it's awesome so what
04:46 - we could do is search for you know
04:47 - specific things like door and then
04:50 - whenever we do that we got all the door
04:53 - aspects look how many there are pretty
04:55 - cool huh
04:56 - all the different doors door sounds door
05:00 - static meshes so that's how we can
05:02 - search for specific assets we can also
05:06 - not search that and hop over to here and
05:09 - this allows us to search for specific
05:10 - types of asset searches what we're gonna
05:14 - be doing is we're gonna be searching for
05:15 - material so later on in the next
05:17 - tutorial I'm gonna go ahead and click
05:19 - materials and then I'm gonna be
05:21 - scrolling through here and we're gonna
05:23 - be finding the material that we want to
05:24 - apply to our house but it's basically an
05:27 - advanced search engine and you have a
05:30 - bunch of different options here and
05:31 - whenever we need to I'm gonna be going
05:33 - over these but for now I don't want to
05:35 - throw everything at you once don't want
05:37 - to overwhelm you guys so I'm just gonna
05:39 - leave you at that for now basically just
05:41 - remember this your content browser is
05:44 - where you go is basically a search
05:46 - engine for all your content that you can
05:48 - add into your level such as sounds in 3d
05:52 - models like cars and guns and also
05:54 - textures and materials like cloth and
05:58 - maybe wood or something like that but in
06:01 - the next tutorial I'm actually going to
06:03 - be putting this to use so you might get
06:05 - a better understanding of how this works
06:06 - a little bit better so for now that's
06:08 - all you guys get so thank you guys for
06:10 - watching don't forget to subscribe and
06:12 - I'll see you guys in the next video
