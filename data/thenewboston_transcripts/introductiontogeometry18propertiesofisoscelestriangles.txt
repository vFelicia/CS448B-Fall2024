00:01 - our focus today
00:04 - is isosceles triangles
00:06 - and their their properties
00:11 - so if two sides of an isosceles triangle
00:14 - are congruent then the angles opposite
00:18 - the sides
00:19 - are also congruent
00:22 - so
00:24 - this side is congruent to this side of
00:27 - this triangle
00:29 - so that means that the angle across from
00:32 - this side
00:33 - and the angle across from this side are
00:36 - equal
00:37 - so if this angle equals 24
00:41 - that must mean that x also equals 24.
00:47 - if i know that this
00:50 - side is congruent to this side
00:54 - that means this angle
00:57 - is congruent with this angle
01:00 - so if this angle equals 68 degrees
01:04 - that means that y
01:06 - has to equal 68 degrees
01:10 - and just if we wanted to we could use
01:14 - our
01:16 - interior angles of a triangle property
01:20 - to find out what
01:22 - this equals
01:24 - so 24
01:27 - plus 24
01:29 - plus z
01:30 - equals 180
01:33 - 48 plus c
01:37 - equals 180
01:39 - so
01:40 - z
01:41 - has to equal
01:45 - 132.
01:48 - so we can do the same thing for this one
01:57 - we'll call this w
02:01 - 180
02:04 - this is one
02:07 - 76
02:13 - 136
02:15 - plus w
02:17 - equals 180
02:21 - w
02:22 - equals
02:25 - 44.
02:28 - so
02:31 - the next property
02:33 - if two angles of an isosceles triangle
02:36 - are congruent and the sides opposite the
02:39 - angles are congruent
02:42 - so since these two
02:46 - angle angles have the same measure
02:49 - they're congruent
02:51 - so that means the sides
02:54 - opposite them
02:56 - have to be congruent so if this side is
02:58 - equal to eight
03:00 - x has to equal
03:02 - eight and
03:06 - these two
03:08 - have the same measure
03:11 - therefore they're congruent
03:13 - so the sides opposite that
03:16 - those angles have to be congruent
03:18 - so this side equals thirteen
03:21 - so y must equal thirteen
03:24 - and we don't have any way
03:27 - of finding what this other side is quite
03:30 - yet
03:31 - so that's all we have to do for that one
03:37 - so
03:39 - next video we're going to talk about
03:41 - ratio and proportions
03:44 - in order to compare triangles so make
03:46 - sure you
03:48 - come back and watch that
