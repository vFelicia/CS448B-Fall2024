00:00 - all right houses welcome back and in
00:02 - this video I'm going to talk to you
00:03 - about the map function in Python so the
00:07 - map function is basically a way that you
00:09 - can take a list whatever it is you know
00:11 - a list of foods of names of numbers and
00:15 - you can run each item in that list
00:17 - through a function really easily so
00:20 - let's go ahead and make a simple list
00:22 - I'll just say income so this list is how
00:26 - much money I make and I'll say the first
00:28 - week of work I made $10 the second week
00:31 - I made 30 bucks and the last week I made
00:34 - 75 bucks
00:36 - all right so now I have a list of stuff
00:39 - but I also have this function and I'm
00:44 - just going to make this function really
00:45 - simple to demonstrate you know because
00:48 - we aren't really learning about
00:48 - functions or anything complex I just
00:50 - want to demonstrate the map function so
00:52 - all this function is going to do is it's
00:54 - going to take each of these items in
00:57 - multiplying by two so double your money
00:59 - so we're going to pass in dollars which
01:01 - is each item in the list and we're just
01:04 - going to return okay there we go
01:11 - returned dollars multiplied by two
01:15 - all right so what we can do is we can
01:18 - make a for loop so for items in income
01:21 - and then we can do this yadda yadda
01:23 - tomato tomahto but there's actually an
01:25 - easier and more efficient way so what we
01:28 - can do is actually call the map function
01:31 - now the map function takes two
01:34 - parameters the first one is what
01:36 - function are you going to run all of
01:38 - your items through well it's just double
01:41 - money now we don't have any parameters
01:44 - and the second function is alright what
01:47 - is the list that you want to iterate
01:49 - through well we only have one list which
01:52 - is this so do that
01:54 - so what this is going to do is it's
01:56 - going to go through this list and for
01:58 - each item 10 30 75 it's going to run it
02:02 - through this function now if we just run
02:04 - this right now it's not going to show
02:07 - anything because we don't have any
02:08 - output so let me just go ahead and
02:13 - very like new income equals list.map all
02:20 - right looking good
02:21 - so I basically am going to run through
02:23 - this multiply each of these values by
02:26 - two so we end up with 20 60 and 150 and
02:30 - then I'm just going to take all those
02:32 - values and convert it to a list so we
02:34 - can print it out so print new income and
02:37 - there you go so now you see 20 60 and
02:43 - 150 now again you can also do this with
02:46 - a for loop so just say for item in
02:49 - income and then you can do it that way
02:52 - but this is a much easier way in my
02:57 - opinion and it's a lot more compact so
02:59 - it doesn't clutter up all your code so
03:01 - there you go that is what map is
03:03 - basically taking some kind of iterable
03:06 - and are running it through a function
03:08 - boom roasted see you next time
