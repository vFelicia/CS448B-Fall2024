00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:04 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:07 - this tutorial we're going to be taking a
00:08 - look at by Val now when you're making
00:12 - subs and functions sometimes you want
00:14 - those subs or functions to to be able to
00:16 - use other variables that are outside of
00:19 - it now one way of doing this is by using
00:23 - by Val which is pretty much just giving
00:26 - your function or sub a
00:30 - uh a variable to use in its inside of
00:34 - itself and it doesn't know what what
00:37 - it's equal to but it gets it from
00:39 - another part of the program so let's go
00:42 - ahead and create a little demo
00:43 - application for this we'll go ahead and
00:46 - create a new
00:48 - project now let's go ahead and select
00:51 - Windows forms application and we will
00:53 - just call this by Val and we'll go ahead
00:56 - and wait for that to
00:57 - load now I'll just come over here to to
01:00 - our
01:01 - toolbox and we will add a text
01:05 - box if we can find it we'll add a text
01:11 - box and then we'll add another text
01:16 - box and then we will add a
01:20 - button that says
01:23 - subtract so we'll set the text value of
01:25 - this to
01:27 - subtract and then we'll come up here and
01:29 - set the name to button
01:32 - subtract and just for the sake of saving
01:35 - time I'm not going to rename these text
01:37 - box text boxes so let's go ahead and
01:40 - double click on the subtract button so
01:41 - that it will generate our event handler
01:44 - for that and now what we're going to do
01:46 - is we're going to come down here and we
01:49 - are going to create a function so we'll
01:51 - go ahead and use the private keyword so
01:53 - that nothing outside of this class can
01:55 - use this
01:56 - function so we'll use private
01:58 - function
02:01 - subtract
02:03 - numbers and now inside of these
02:05 - parameters we're going to add a by Val
02:09 - so we'll just start off by typing by Val
02:13 - and then we'll type num one which is the
02:15 - name of what we're going to you what our
02:16 - variable is going to be called inside of
02:19 - our function as
02:22 - integer or let's go ahead and do double
02:25 - just in case they enter values that
02:27 - won't return a whole number when they
02:29 - subtract
02:30 - and then we'll do by Val num two as
02:35 - double and then we will do as double so
02:38 - that our function will return a double
02:41 - so let me go ahead and explain this a
02:43 - little bit to you when somebody calls
02:45 - the function subtracts numbers they're
02:47 - going to have to enter two values the
02:49 - first value is the first number and the
02:51 - second value is the second number so
02:54 - that lets our function subtract numbers
02:55 - use the two numbers that we've given to
02:57 - it and then it can do whatever it needs
02:59 - to and then give you back the
03:01 - answer so we'll just go ahead and type
03:05 - return num one minus num
03:08 - two so now what we'll do is we will come
03:13 - up here and we'll go ahead and create a
03:18 - in an instance of subtract numbers so
03:21 - we'll go ahead and start by typing
03:23 - message box. show and the first thing
03:26 - that we want to show in the message box
03:28 - the message of it
03:30 - is we are going to type subtract
03:34 - numbers and then we're going to need two
03:36 - arguments for this the first argument is
03:39 - going to be the num one and what we're
03:42 - going to use as num one is textbox
03:47 - one dot text so basically what this is
03:51 - going to do is it's going to get the
03:53 - text from our first text box right here
03:55 - and it's going to use that as the number
03:57 - and subtract
03:58 - numbers and then for our second
04:02 - argument we are going to use textbox
04:07 - 2.
04:10 - text and we'll go ahead and close off
04:12 - these parentheses and now if we run
04:16 - this you can see that it shows up our
04:18 - form and if we type the number 30 and
04:21 - then we type the number 10 and click
04:24 - subtract it's going to show us a message
04:26 - box with
04:28 - 20 now this part right up here may be a
04:30 - little confusing to you so I'll just go
04:32 - ahead and try and simplify it a bit so
04:35 - we'll go ahead and create a double
04:38 - variable so we'll type answer dim answer
04:42 - as double and we will set it equal to
04:45 - subtract
04:47 - numbers textbox one.
04:52 - text and then we will use textbox 2.
04:56 - text so what this is going to do is it's
04:59 - going to return a double and it's going
05:00 - to be stored in the variable answer so
05:03 - now instead of printing all this putting
05:05 - all this in our message box. show we can
05:08 - just add
05:11 - answer and we can also use answer
05:13 - anywhere else so we can type answer plus
05:16 - equals 1 and we can use that later on
05:18 - instead of it just being used inside of
05:20 - this messagebox
05:22 - doow so you can add as many buy vals as
05:26 - you want you can do them with different
05:28 - types you can use strings integers booin
05:32 - characters and they don't have to be the
05:35 - same as your function type so I could
05:37 - type num one as string and it'll work
05:41 - perfectly fine even though our function
05:43 - type is a double and it's going to need
05:45 - to return a double we can still pass
05:47 - whatever data types we need to
05:51 - it so go ahead and practice with using B
05:54 - Val um you can create some functions and
05:57 - the easiest way to practice this is by
05:59 - making making some calculator functions
06:01 - and um reference use by Val to pass
06:06 - variables or numbers into your functions
06:09 - and um once you've done that and you're
06:11 - familiar with it go ahead and move on to
06:13 - the next tutorial and thanks for
06:14 - watching
