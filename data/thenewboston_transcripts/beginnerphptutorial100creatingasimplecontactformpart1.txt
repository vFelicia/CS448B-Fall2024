00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:03 - and I'm back with another video for the
00:05 - new Boston now in the previous video we
00:08 - looked at sending email using PHP mail
00:12 - function if you haven't already watched
00:15 - that video I recommend you go back and
00:16 - watch it before you watch this
00:18 - as this video is going to deal with
00:20 - submitting a contact form so for example
00:23 - you've seen websites where you have a
00:25 - Contact Us page and you fill in your
00:29 - information and you click the submit
00:32 - button
00:32 - now this then sends where I could do
00:35 - them it could be storing values in a
00:36 - database but for now we're going to be
00:38 - dealing with sending an email address
00:40 - sending the message to a specific email
00:43 - address and that's how we're going to
00:48 - receive it so the first thing we're
00:49 - going to do is we're going to create our
00:51 - form so let's go ahead and say form
00:53 - action equals something and method
00:56 - equals something and then we end with
00:59 - form so the form action is going to be
01:02 - index.php so we're going to be
01:04 - submitting back to the same page and
01:06 - this is going to submit it in post data
01:09 - so we're going to submit a large amount
01:11 - of data that we don't want to be shown
01:12 - in the URL bar so we use the post method
01:15 - to send the data in our form so let's go
01:18 - ahead and set up the form before we
01:20 - start processing our script or inside
01:24 - PHP so the first field I'm going to
01:28 - create is a name and oh sorry and I'm
01:35 - going to break down after this and I'm
01:40 - going to say input type its text because
01:42 - we're taking the text value for the name
01:44 - and the name of this is a contact name
01:48 - okay now we're going to break down a
01:51 - couple of times and we're going to say
01:54 - email address
01:57 - and we're going to break and we're going
02:00 - to set input type equals text again name
02:05 - equals contact email I'm not going to
02:09 - specify things like telephone field this
02:11 - is up to you to an input for yourself
02:13 - but the next thing I'm going to do is
02:16 - message so this is we're just going to
02:18 - be passing three fields through PHP
02:20 - they're going to be sent to our email
02:23 - address so now message we're going to
02:28 - put a text area so a text area is just a
02:31 - large text area that can be typed in the
02:33 - text area I'm going to give this a name
02:36 - of contact text and we're going to set
02:43 - the rows equal to something and the
02:45 - calls or something that's other columns
02:47 - so we've got six here and say 30 a that
02:50 - should give us a large enough space to
02:52 - submit our data so we're going to go on
02:55 - the presumption that all of our fields
02:58 - are required by this contact form so
03:01 - obviously you can chop and change and
03:02 - within PHP we can make the relevant
03:04 - checks but for now I'm going to do a
03:07 - couple of breaks down and I'm going to
03:09 - create our submit button so it's a type
03:12 - submit and the value is going to be send
03:16 - so let's go ahead and save this page and
03:19 - we can preview this in our in our
03:23 - browser so I'm going to refresh the page
03:25 - so you can see we've got a pretty
03:27 - standard looking and looking contact
03:30 - form now it's obviously up to you to
03:32 - change the design of this you can
03:34 - obviously implement CSS if you know how
03:36 - pop this into your own design so for now
03:40 - I'm just starting with the most basic
03:42 - basic layout so we can type information
03:45 - into here and what we want to do is we
03:47 - want to we want to enter a different
03:52 - email addresses and our messages and
03:55 - we're going to test out well we're going
03:57 - to fill in all fields first of all this
03:59 - is what we need to make sure will happen
04:01 - so let's go over to back to our file and
04:06 - edit this ok so inside PHP when this is
04:10 - submitted the first thing that we want
04:12 - to do is we want to check to see if the
04:14 - form has been submitted so we need to
04:16 - check that each element is set so we use
04:20 - the is set construct and we set is set
04:23 - that underscore post because remember
04:25 - we're submitting these variables using
04:27 - the post variable so we post method so
04:30 - we pick them up by dollar underscore
04:31 - post and then inside here we need to
04:35 - specify the first variable that we're
04:37 - passing and this is contact name then we
04:40 - need to say and so we apply the and
04:42 - operator so we're saying if the contact
04:45 - name is set and dollar underscore I'm
04:48 - sorry and is set dollar underscore post
04:52 - and we need to now specify the next
04:56 - field that we are submitting that's
04:58 - contact email at just a word of warning
05:02 - before I continue we're not actually
05:04 - going to be dealing with email
05:05 - validation and the reason for this is
05:08 - it's a lot too too big and too
05:10 - unnecessary for this tutorial so there
05:13 - will be another tutorial in my tutorials
05:17 - for the new Boston that will deal with
05:18 - email validation so go over and have a
05:21 - look at that and you'll be able to apply
05:23 - this to your your contact form
