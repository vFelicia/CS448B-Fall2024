00:00 - hey welcome back everyone this is Ian
00:02 - bringing you another AI video with the
00:04 - New Boston so if you have been following
00:06 - along with our previous videos and
00:08 - you've tried to run your code and you've
00:10 - experienced an error like the one that
00:12 - we're looking at here where it says
00:14 - attribute error module open AI has no
00:17 - attribute chat completion then this
00:19 - video is going to show you how to fix
00:21 - that so the issue the reason why we're
00:23 - getting this airor is because previously
00:25 - we were using an older version of the
00:27 - open AI Library these things are
00:29 - changing very quickly it's getting
00:31 - upgraded really fast and so now the
00:33 - newer version has some breaking changes
00:36 - so with those breaking changes you
00:37 - wouldn't be able to run some of these
00:39 - syntax from our previous videos the
00:41 - solution in the short term would just be
00:43 - to use the version that we used whenever
00:45 - we recorded the video and that would be
00:46 - like 0.28 or something like that however
00:50 - you want to use the latest and greatest
00:51 - so I'm going to show you how to migrate
00:53 - your code to use the newer version of
00:55 - the library and its syntax all right so
00:58 - basically the first thing want to do is
01:00 - upgrade now you probably already
01:02 - upgraded if you're you know whether or
01:04 - not you know it you may have installed
01:06 - the newest version but if you are using
01:07 - an older version and you see that inside
01:10 - of your virtual environment that you
01:12 - have like 0.28 or something like that or
01:15 - 0.279 then what you can do is an easy
01:19 - pip uninstall open AI make sure that
01:23 - your virtual environment is activated
01:24 - you want to uninstall this from your
01:26 - local virtual environment for this
01:28 - project so we'll go ahead and that
01:30 - command and when it's done running it's
01:32 - going to actually prompt us here whether
01:33 - or not we want to do it at least it does
01:35 - this on windows so I say y for yes and
01:38 - it finishes all right so you can see
01:40 - that I had the latest version at least
01:42 - at the time of this recording
01:44 - 1.1.2 uh yours may be a different
01:46 - version now let's get the latest version
01:49 - so once you've uninstalled it all you
01:50 - have to do is PIP install open Ai and
01:55 - this will give you the current version
01:57 - so maybe 1.1.2 or who knows they may
02:00 - have updated it again by the time we get
02:01 - this video released all right so with
02:04 - this version 1.1.2 there are some
02:07 - changes to the syntax so if you were to
02:09 - run your code you would get the error
02:11 - that we showed at the uh beginning of
02:13 - the video all right so I'm going to go
02:16 - back to the very first tutorial 01 basic
02:18 - main.py we import OS we import openai so
02:22 - what we're going to do now is we
02:23 - actually don't have to import the OS uh
02:26 - you can if you want to put something in
02:29 - other than open AI API key but that's
02:32 - what it's going to look for by default
02:33 - so as long as you export your
02:35 - environment variable for your API key
02:37 - with this name then you won't need to
02:39 - use OS here so with that said what we
02:42 - can do is we can say something like from
02:45 - open AI import and then I think it's
02:48 - open AI like
02:50 - this with a capital O and then a capital
02:54 - Ai and then what we do here on the next
02:56 - line is we say something like client is
02:59 - equal to
03:00 - and then we can say open AI open close
03:02 - parenthesis and so this will create a
03:05 - new open AI client for us from this open
03:07 - AI class and then we can use this client
03:10 - for all of our requests however the
03:12 - syntax has changed slightly so let's go
03:14 - down and modify that as well so if we go
03:17 - down here we can see where we have open
03:19 - Ai and we no longer have that variable
03:21 - so I'm getting some red underscores here
03:24 - uh letting me know hey you know this is
03:26 - not a valid variable so I'm going to
03:27 - change it to client so that'll fix that
03:29 - problem and now we no longer have chat
03:32 - completion Capital C and chat Capital C
03:35 - and completion what we have is lowercase
03:38 - chat Dot and then I think it's
03:41 - completions plural so let me get rid of
03:43 - the old great so it's client. chat.
03:47 - completions all lowercase is going to
03:49 - replace the open ai. Capital C chat
03:53 - Capital C completion. create so what we
03:56 - end up with is client. chat. completion.
03:58 - create and everything else stays the
04:00 - same okay so now when we run this we
04:03 - should be able to print the response I'm
04:05 - not going to print this part of the
04:07 - response I'm really most interested in
04:09 - the content down here just so that we
04:10 - know that this is working so let's go
04:12 - ahead and run this python main.py of
04:15 - course your virtual environment is
04:17 - activated you're inside of the open AI
04:19 - examples in fact I'm inside the wrong
04:21 - folder so let me go ahead and fix that
04:23 - so I'm going to CD into 01 basic and
04:26 - then I'm going to run main. Pi here so
04:29 - this will take a second and we should
04:30 - get some text back here in a moment the
04:32 - NHL team that plays in Pittsburgh is the
04:34 - Pittsburgh Penguins so that's it for
04:36 - upgrading you're just going to uninstall
04:38 - open AI with your virtual environment
04:40 - activated you're going to reinstall it
04:42 - using pip and then you're going to
04:43 - update that syntax like we just did
04:45 - that's it for this video thanks for
04:47 - tuning in and we'll catch you in the
04:48 - next one peace
