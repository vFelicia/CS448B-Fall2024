00:00 - welcome back eyes through 34th C++
00:03 - tutorial and in this lesson I'm going to
00:05 - teach you guys how to use an array in
00:07 - calculations and it's actually a pretty
00:09 - simple program definitely useful
00:11 - definitely something you want to stay
00:13 - tuned for so let's go ahead and make an
00:16 - array right now let's call it tuna I'm
00:18 - getting tired of using Bucky every time
00:20 - and let's set the tuna array big enough
00:23 - to hold five integer values looks good
00:25 - enough and now let's go ahead and use an
00:27 - array initializer list um let's go ahead
00:31 - and throw in 2050 476 832 and whatever
00:39 - this number is right there so now we
00:41 - created an array called tuna and it has
00:43 - five different elements or five
00:45 - different values in it so now what we
00:48 - want to do is say our boss came to us
00:50 - are a teacher and he's like build a
00:52 - program that calculates the sum of all
00:56 - of these elements so we're saying all
00:57 - right the first thing we need is a
00:59 - variable to hold that sum and by default
01:02 - since it doesn't have any elements at
01:03 - first we're going to set it equal to
01:05 - zero so what we could do is this sum
01:09 - equals looks I try to type Bucky again
01:12 - tuna zero plus tuna oh you know what I'm
01:20 - getting a bunch of typos and this is
01:21 - just taken too long not very efficient
01:24 - way of doing it although it would work
01:25 - so let me go ahead and show you guys a
01:27 - much easier way to use an array in
01:30 - calculation so instead of all that
01:33 - typing let's go ahead and make a for
01:35 - loop instead so now what we need to do
01:38 - is just like before
01:39 - find out which array index is our array
01:43 - is going to need and just use our for
01:45 - loop to loop through those array indexes
01:47 - so of course as always we need to start
01:50 - at zero because the first index in every
01:52 - array is zero alright now let's do a
01:54 - little bit of thinking but not too much
01:56 - tuna holds five values so that means the
02:00 - last index in that array is four so if
02:04 - you're right X is less than 5 what it's
02:08 - going to do is
02:09 - going to go from zero to four it's not
02:11 - going to do five because five is not
02:13 - less than five so now when you press X
02:15 - plus plus we now have a four loop that
02:18 - loops from zero to four so it's going to
02:21 - go zero one two three four those are
02:23 - going to be your X values so what we can
02:26 - do now is just use some plus equals tuna
02:30 - X now what this is going to do is this
02:34 - the first thing it's going to do the
02:37 - very first time it runs the loop is
02:38 - going to say this all right X is equal
02:41 - to zero so add tuna zero which is 22 the
02:45 - sum now the sum is going to be equal to
02:48 - 20 the next time it's going to be one so
02:51 - add tuna one which is 50 for equal to
02:54 - the sum which is 20 so now it's going to
02:56 - be 74 so it's going to go through each
02:59 - of these elements one by one and add
03:02 - each value to the value of sum so let's
03:05 - go ahead and just print out this on the
03:07 - screen um see out some end line and now
03:13 - you can see a better idea of what's
03:14 - going on so like I said one by one the
03:18 - very first time it runs it's going to
03:20 - add tuna zero equal to sum the next time
03:23 - tuna one equal to some tuna - two -
03:27 - three - four so if you add up all these
03:30 - values right here you get the value of
03:34 - 1528 so one last time what we did is
03:38 - this we created an array called tuna
03:41 - using an array initializer list that
03:43 - holds five integers 1 2 3 4 5 now what
03:48 - we wanted to do is we wanted to
03:50 - calculate the sum so we made a variable
03:52 - called sum and of course by default
03:54 - since it didn't have any value we set
03:56 - equal to 0 then we made a for loop using
04:00 - the value in here excuse me the variable
04:03 - to loop through each index of our array
04:05 - so it started at 0
04:08 - and since we know this one was two and a
04:10 - four that's what we put for here X is
04:13 - less than five and of course we want to
04:15 - go one at a time we don't want to skip
04:17 - you know this one in this one or
04:18 - anything so then what we did is we loop
04:20 - through each value and added it to the
04:23 - variable sum and then we just printed
04:25 - out some on the screen and that's what
04:27 - we got 20 74 115 9 82
04:30 - 15 28 so that's a real simple program in
04:34 - order to use arrays and the array
04:37 - indexes and elements and values and
04:39 - calculations yadda yadda yadda all that
04:41 - fun stuff so now you guys know how to
04:43 - use arrays in calculations you're ready
04:45 - to move on to my next tutorial we're
04:47 - going to be talking I'm going to teach
04:48 - you guys something else about an array
04:50 - that's actually pretty cool so don't
04:52 - forget to watch that tutorial thank you
04:53 - guys for watching and don't forget to
