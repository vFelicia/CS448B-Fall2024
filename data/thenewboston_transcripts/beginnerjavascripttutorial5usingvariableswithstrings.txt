00:00 - what is up guys welcome back to your
00:02 - fifth JavaScript tutorial and in this
00:04 - story I mean teaching you guys how to
00:06 - use variables with the string of text in
00:09 - your program so it's going to be awesome
00:11 - and it's actually really helpful in
00:14 - understanding how these programs work
00:16 - and trust me you're going to use this a
00:18 - lot whenever your program in JavaScript
00:20 - so let's go ahead and uh well enough of
00:22 - me talking let's go ahead and get
00:24 - started so the first thing that we need
00:26 - is two variables go ahead and make a
00:28 - variable called name and just set it
00:30 - equal to of course whatever your name is
00:32 - Bucky and go ahead and make another
00:35 - variable called like age or something
00:37 - and set this equal to your age I'm 24 so
00:41 - of course I'm going to set mine it's 24
00:43 - so we already know that we can use
00:46 - document dot write to basically write
00:49 - things out on the screen so we can
00:50 - either write name and if we go ahead and
00:53 - print this out it says Bucky or we could
00:55 - have went ahead and printed out age and
00:57 - it will print out 24 but what if we
01:01 - wanted to include this within a bigger
01:03 - string of text well in order to do that
01:06 - you need to use the addition operator
01:08 - aka the plus sign and you write the
01:12 - addition and this sticks it to whatever
01:14 - string of text you're trying to type out
01:16 - so for example it says Bucky um is my
01:20 - name so go ahead and it's going to treat
01:22 - this as the word Bucky and it's going to
01:25 - add it with this string so let's go
01:27 - ahead and just see it now says Bucky is
01:30 - my name simple enough so anyways
01:33 - whenever you want to write a variable
01:36 - inside a string of text you just can't
01:38 - you know write something like this you
01:42 - just can't go ahead and write name is my
01:45 - name or else check it out it's going to
01:47 - say your name is my name if you want to
01:49 - treat that as the variable you need to
01:51 - put it outside the quotation marks and
01:53 - you need to stick it together with that
01:55 - plus sign and then it works perfectly
01:57 - and not only can you do this before but
02:01 - say you want to write something after
02:03 - like Bucky is my name and my age is
02:07 - plus h so again not only can you do this
02:11 - before your text but you can also do it
02:13 - after and check it out
02:15 - Bucky is my name and my age is 24 so
02:19 - easy enough that is how you use
02:22 - variables alongside strings of text
02:24 - whenever you're trying to write out
02:25 - stuff so let's go ahead and delete all
02:28 - this and let me um let's go ahead and
02:30 - make some new variables let's go ahead
02:32 - and make a very my own name tuna and set
02:35 - this equal to I am a fish and then go
02:40 - ahead another make another variable
02:41 - called bacon and set this equal to
02:46 - Baconator and then go ahead and add one
02:50 - more called mmm
02:52 - only got like two things why don't I
02:54 - think a tuna and bacon table time any
02:56 - time I make a variable I made like a
02:58 - thousand Sorrells and I swear I only
03:01 - made like two variables tuna bacon and
03:04 - ham so heck it might as well include ham
03:07 - and set this equal to am burglar make
03:13 - sure it's spelled around or else it
03:14 - won't work so anyways we have three
03:17 - variables right now and we already know
03:19 - that we can stick them on a string of
03:21 - text but what you didn't know or maybe
03:23 - you did is that you can also stick them
03:25 - alongside one another so tuna bacon plus
03:29 - ham and whenever we try to print this
03:32 - out it's going to give us I'm a fish
03:34 - Baconator Hamburglar so let's go ahead
03:35 - and see that I'm a fish Baconator
03:38 - hamburger you know it doesn't make any
03:40 - sense at all and I probably should pick
03:42 - something that did make sense but hey
03:44 - this is just an example who the heck
03:47 - cares so anyways that's what I wanted to
03:49 - teach you guys in this tutorial about
03:50 - that addition sign and whenever you're
03:52 - working with variables or strings of
03:54 - text you need to include that addition
03:57 - sign or else it's not going to work so
03:59 - again that's all I want to teach you
04:01 - guys for this tutorial in the next
04:03 - tutorial we're going to be diving a
04:04 - little deeper and in JavaScript and
04:06 - going over some more advanced topics but
04:08 - trust me they're going to be easy to
04:10 - follow along with and just stick with me
04:12 - in no time you'll be a JavaScript pro so
04:15 - anyways thank you guys for watching
04:17 - don't forget if you have any questions
04:19 - just go to my forum the New Boston comm
04:21 - slash forum and if I don't answer them
