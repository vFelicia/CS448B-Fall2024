00:00 - now what we're going to be doing is
00:01 - we're going to setting' we're going to
00:02 - be setting this a value to zero
00:06 - initially when the button has been
00:08 - clicked and then we're going to just
00:09 - create a set interval timer which is
00:12 - going to gradually increase this value
00:14 - and this obviously doesn't have
00:16 - practical applications but it shows us
00:18 - what the progress bar will look like
00:20 - once it is in place and actually has a
00:23 - real value to to feedback to this sir to
00:27 - this widget so just for now I'm going to
00:30 - go ahead and get rid of this line here
00:31 - and I'm going to create a new variable
00:34 - called interval and that's going to be
00:36 - equal to set interval and inside here we
00:41 - have a function so we pull this down now
00:44 - inside here is what's going to happen
00:46 - every X amount of seconds and we define
00:49 - the second just after this here so I'm
00:52 - going to do 50 milliseconds which is
00:54 - obviously point zero five over second
00:56 - and this is going to allow us to if
00:58 - gradually increase this particular value
01:00 - every 50 milliseconds so let's go ahead
01:04 - and update this value each time so we're
01:07 - going to say Val equals of hour plus one
01:09 - so that's going to increase the value
01:12 - here by one every 50 milliseconds and
01:16 - then what we can do is go ahead and
01:18 - implement or or put this into the value
01:20 - of the progress bar so again we create
01:23 - we reference or select the progress bar
01:26 - div and we use dot progress bar as we
01:30 - did before but this time we're going to
01:32 - go ahead and define a value in here
01:35 - which will be equal to Val and because
01:37 - it's equal to Val every 50 milliseconds
01:39 - this will increase by one and therefore
01:42 - the progress bar will constantly update
01:44 - with this updating value here this
01:46 - variable Val so let's go ahead and test
01:49 - that out and then we're going to go on
01:50 - to look at how to relay this back to the
01:52 - percentage so when I click upload' you
01:54 - can see that that gradually increases
01:56 - all the way to the end however we do
01:59 - have a problem when it gets to the end
02:01 - now the percentage the value is
02:04 - constantly increasing now so what we
02:06 - want to do is we need a way to break
02:08 - this interval because obviously this
02:11 - interval is still
02:12 - on this page now even though we can't
02:14 - see this beyond fit beyond 100 so the
02:17 - interval is still happening so this is
02:19 - wasting resources it's taking up you
02:22 - know too much processing power so what
02:25 - we want is a simple check underneath
02:27 - here to say if Val
02:29 - in fact we won't do this bit yet we'll
02:31 - go ahead and update the D percentage so
02:34 - essentially all we want to do is we want
02:36 - to reference this percentage so we use a
02:39 - selector percent and we want to apply
02:42 - text into here and that text is going to
02:45 - be Val and then we append on a
02:47 - percentage sign so now when we preview
02:50 - this in our browser you'll see that not
02:52 - only do we get the progress bar but we
02:54 - get an updating percentage as well and
02:56 - you can see that going all the way up
02:57 - when the progress bar reaches the end we
03:00 - assume it's still at 100 but in actual
03:03 - fact that timer is still in place so
03:05 - this percentage is gradually increasing
03:07 - so obviously we don't want this so we
03:09 - want to break out of this interval so
03:12 - although this is only for demonstration
03:15 - purposes we want to keep it as efficient
03:18 - as possible if you do decide to run this
03:20 - on a live on a live page where people
03:23 - can access it so I'm going to create an
03:25 - if statement with a block and the
03:27 - condition is if val is equal to 100
03:30 - obviously that's at 100% we want to
03:33 - clear interval and the interval we want
03:36 - to specify is this interval here that we
03:39 - set because we set the interval into a
03:41 - variable called interval so we just
03:43 - clear interval interval so we define the
03:46 - variable that holds this set interval
03:49 - function so now that that's happened we
03:52 - will have this value stopped at 100 and
03:55 - the interval will be cleared and
03:57 - therefore nothing else will be happening
03:58 - you can still this see this is still
04:00 - going up now so let's go ahead and press
04:02 - upload you can see this is gradually
04:04 - increasing this time when it reaches 100
04:07 - the interval is going to be cleared so
04:09 - elite we end with the Val equal to 100
04:14 - so now that we've seen the practical
04:17 - application of this obviously it's
04:18 - important to think about why you
04:20 - wouldn't just use this on its own
04:23 - the progress bar has a limited amount of
04:25 - options for this because of this it's
04:28 - essentially because we don't use it on
04:32 - its own we use it to simply feed in a
04:34 - value this might be from you know like I
04:37 - said earlier an external PHP script that
04:39 - uploads or something on the page that
04:42 - feeds back a value with PHP you can feed
04:44 - back the percentage of a debt out of an
04:47 - upload and therefore you could implement
04:49 - it into this value here as opposed to
04:52 - the mock-up value that we've created so
04:55 - that's how easy progress bar is to
04:57 - implement and the value option to define
05:00 - how far along the progress bar is
