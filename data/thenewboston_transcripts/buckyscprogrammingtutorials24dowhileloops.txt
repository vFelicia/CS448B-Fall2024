00:00 - what is going on guys it's Bucky and
00:02 - welcome to your 24th tutorial in C++ and
00:05 - in this story we're going to be covering
00:07 - the do-while loop but you guys probably
00:09 - already knew that because I got a
00:11 - feeling that the title is right above
00:13 - this video and you know what else I do a
00:16 - lot I tell you guys this is probably
00:18 - going to be a short video and I just
00:20 - realized that the time is right under
00:22 - the video so I don't know why I say
00:24 - those things but it's habit I'm going to
00:26 - continue to say those things so get over
00:28 - it so anyways we're going to be covering
00:32 - the do-while loop in this tutorial and
00:34 - if you remember from I don't know
00:36 - however many tutorials those go I talked
00:39 - to you guys about the while loop and the
00:41 - while loop was basically a loop that you
00:43 - had a test and if that test was true
00:46 - then you ran a bit of code inside while
00:49 - the do-while loop is basically the while
00:51 - loop flipped upside down what the do
00:54 - while loop does is it runs the bit of
00:56 - code first and then it runs the test so
00:59 - let's go ahead and let me show it to you
01:00 - guys and you guys will understand better
01:02 - one means let's go ahead and get a
01:04 - counting variable called X and set it
01:06 - equal to one this is our starting point
01:08 - now the syntax for do-while loop is do
01:11 - and then you go ahead and add some code
01:14 - in the body so let's just go ahead and
01:15 - print out X
01:19 - and then after this we need to increment
01:22 - X or else the loop is going to run
01:23 - forever so X plus plus and now after the
01:27 - body immediately after it you write
01:30 - while and then after this you have your
01:32 - test ended with a semicolon
01:34 - a lot of people forget that semicolon
01:36 - because then basic while loop
01:37 - there is no semicolon if it's not in the
01:40 - body so don't forget to put this in my
01:42 - Coleman right here so let's give a
01:43 - simple test like X is less than 10 now
01:46 - go ahead and run this and check it out
01:48 - just like the wild loop it ran the same
01:51 - bit of code print it out X on the screen
01:53 - from 1 all the way to 9 pretty cool huh
01:56 - so we're saying all right a couple of
01:58 - things are kind of weird here first of
02:01 - all why is this loop even useful because
02:04 - it seems like a bad while loop because
02:06 - isn't the point of a loop to run the
02:09 - test first and if the test is true then
02:12 - run a bit of code but if it's false then
02:14 - don't run the bit of code well people
02:17 - use do loop mainly for this reason
02:19 - whenever you have code in here and you
02:22 - need it to run at least one time it's
02:25 - guaranteed to run at least at one time
02:27 - and the reason is this say you have a
02:30 - test that is false like 99 well this
02:32 - test is going to come false as soon as
02:34 - it hits it 99 is not less than 10 99 is
02:37 - a whole lot bigger than 10 so whenever
02:40 - you run this is just going to print out
02:42 - 99 so as you can see it ensures that you
02:46 - run your code at least one time before
02:49 - testing it at all so no matter what this
02:51 - value is it's going to do it one time
02:54 - and then test it so whenever you want to
02:57 - run your code guarantee that it runs at
02:59 - least one time this is what you do so
03:01 - that's the main reason that people use a
03:04 - do-while loop to ensure their code runs
03:06 - at least one time again if you have a
03:08 - basic program and you just want to loop
03:10 - it normally your best bet is to run the
03:12 - while loop or the for loop because those
03:15 - are your basic loops where you test it
03:16 - and then depending on the test you run
03:20 - your program so again this is basically
03:22 - a weird a kind of loop this is probably
03:25 - the most uncock
03:27 - Loup but whenever you come across it I
03:29 - wanted you guys to pick up on it
03:31 - understand what it's doing and why some
03:33 - people prefer it over the wall loop so
03:36 - now that you have knowledge of the
03:37 - do-while loop and you guys know that
03:39 - it's really not that common in
03:42 - programming so you don't want to use it
03:43 - that often you at least know what it
03:47 - does and how I was going to say how it
03:50 - worked well yeah that makes sense and
03:52 - how it works so anyways that's all I
03:54 - have to cover for the do-while loop
03:56 - pretty simple basically a while loop
03:58 - flipped upside down so thank you guys
03:59 - for watching don't forget to subscribe
04:01 - and yep I'll see you in the next video
