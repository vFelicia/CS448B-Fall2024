00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog
00:02 - back with another video for the new
00:04 - Boston now in this tutorial we're going
00:07 - to be looking at incrementing a value in
00:09 - a database by grabbing the value and
00:12 - updating it and we're going to do this
00:14 - in the way of a hit counter and it's
00:17 - going to be a unique hit counter we're
00:19 - also going to have another table
00:21 - despite the one where we're counting a
00:23 - single value we're incrementing a single
00:26 - value we're going to have a table that's
00:28 - going to store the IP address of the
00:29 - users that are visited it's a very sort
00:33 - of loose way to do it it's just going to
00:34 - give you an idea of updating and and
00:36 - everything like that but we're going to
00:38 - keep a track of the users that visited
00:40 - so if the user has visited we're not
00:42 - going to increment the value so it's
00:45 - basically a unique hit counter but using
00:47 - what we've already learned with with SQL
00:50 - and SQL statements or queries rather so
00:54 - we've already got this food table but
00:56 - we're going to ignore that for now
00:57 - because that was from the last tutorial
00:58 - what we want to now do is create a new
01:01 - table and I'm going to call this hits
01:05 - count hits underscore count now this is
01:09 - going to be a single field table gonna
01:11 - have one field on it and this is going
01:14 - to just be an integer starting from zero
01:17 - and we're going to work our way up as we
01:20 - refresh the page as long as our IP
01:21 - address doesn't exist in another table
01:24 - which is what we incur in a minute so if
01:26 - we click go the field we're specifying
01:29 - is going to be called count is an
01:31 - integer we're going to set it as the
01:32 - primary key because technically is a
01:35 - unique value however we don't need an
01:37 - auto increment because we're going to be
01:40 - specifying this value anyway we could
01:42 - put Auto increment that would be a lot
01:44 - easier but it would avoid the point of
01:46 - teaching you perhaps how this can work
01:48 - another way so the quick and easy way
01:51 - would be to click Auto increment but
01:54 - what we're going to do is we're going to
01:55 - grab the current value and then add one
01:58 - to it and then increment so we're going
02:00 - the long way around things but it's
02:02 - going to allow you to practice a lot
02:04 - more okay so we need to save this let's
02:08 - just go down and save that so we created
02:11 - this table with this
02:13 - count value here if we browse the table
02:16 - at the moment we've got nothing in so
02:18 - what we're going to do is initially
02:19 - we're going to need to set this value to
02:21 - zero by clicking insert entering zero
02:24 - and clicking go you can now see that
02:27 - when we browse we've got count equal to
02:29 - zero now within PHP we're not going to
02:31 - do anything else in MySQL with regards
02:33 - to this in PHP we're going to grab this
02:35 - value add one and then reinsert it into
02:38 - here or update it rather so we need
02:41 - another table now and that's going to be
02:43 - called hits IP and this is going to be a
02:46 - list of the IP addresses that have
02:47 - accessed the site so again we just need
02:50 - one field and this is going to be IP we
02:55 - don't need to set this to a primary key
02:57 - this is going to be a VAR char now if
03:00 - you think about an IP address let's just
03:02 - go to here we've got a possibility of
03:07 - this and this amount of characters in an
03:09 - IP address so we've got three here and
03:12 - six nine twelve in length add the three
03:16 - dot is thirteen fourteen and fifteen so
03:19 - we need it to be fifteen characters or
03:22 - less and we're not going to sell it to
03:27 - primary it will give us a warning that
03:28 - we haven't set it to primary but that
03:30 - doesn't matter
03:30 - so now index defined here but that's
03:33 - okay so IP address is going to be stored
03:36 - in here in a long list and it counts are
03:41 - going to be stored in here now there are
03:43 - other ways to do this obviously we could
03:45 - just have a method to store the IP
03:48 - addresses and then count the amount of
03:50 - IP addresses or unique IP addresses that
03:52 - were present using the MySQL num rows
03:55 - function and that's going to work in
03:56 - exactly the same way so there's loads of
03:59 - possibilities to create this but like I
04:01 - said I'm just going the long way around
04:03 - things so we learn a bit better so back
04:06 - to PHP we're not really going to do much
04:08 - more in my PHP myadmin now I'm going to
04:12 - first of all include or require this
04:14 - connect file that we've created earlier
04:17 - on in the tutorials if you haven't
04:18 - already seen that I suggest you do so if
04:20 - you don't know how to connect to a
04:21 - database so we've connected to our
04:23 - database I'm requiring this within our
04:25 - page
04:26 - so if it's not there we're not going to
04:28 - run the page simple enough
04:30 - the next thing we need to do is grab the
04:33 - user IP and I'm going to put this into a
04:34 - variable called user IP so remember
04:37 - we're using dollar underscore server and
04:39 - then we need to remote address in there
04:41 - with the dress shortened there's another
04:44 - tutorial on this as well if you haven't
04:45 - already learn how to do this so we've
04:49 - created a variable called user IP let's
04:50 - just echo that out this is just to check
04:55 - the we're getting a value back correctly
05:01 - okay so don't seem to be getting a value
05:04 - back
05:11 - oh it's because we haven't saved the
05:12 - file so that would help let's refresh
05:15 - okay so I've got my local IP address
05:17 - being returned to me we can test it just
05:19 - with this so what's going to happen is
05:22 - I'm going to refresh the page the hit
05:24 - counter is going to go up my IP address
05:26 - is going to be stored then the next time
05:28 - i refresh we're going to check for my IP
05:29 - if my IP does exist in the database or
05:32 - in the table rather we're not going to
05:34 - update account but if it doesn't again
05:36 - we are so it's essentially like a file
05:40 - based account like we've already
05:41 - discussed in some of the other tutorials
05:43 - if you haven't seen that and you want to
05:45 - look at that then you can go back and
05:47 - view them but now we're using databases
05:50 - instead okay so we're going to be using
05:54 - two functions within our program I'm
05:57 - going to predefined these functions out
05:58 - going to write a skeleton if you like of
06:00 - these functions and then we're going to
06:02 - fill them in at later date so the first
06:05 - function is going to be called an IP
06:08 - exists and the argument we're going to
06:12 - give this is IP so we're going to be
06:14 - specifying the IP address into this
06:16 - function so it's going to look something
06:17 - like like this
06:25 - and obviously this variable here is
06:27 - going to be user IP so that's our first
06:32 - function our next function is going to
06:34 - be let's just say update count and this
06:40 - is going to take no arguments because
06:43 - all we're doing is incrementing the
06:44 - value by one that's simple enough
06:46 - now because we've declared this user IP
06:49 - outside of our functions we need to
06:53 - create a global of these inside so it's
06:56 - an global user IP that's going to allow
06:59 - us to use this IP address outside there
07:01 - and sorry we don't need to do that in
07:04 - this function but we do in this function
07:05 - because we need to get the IP and we
07:09 - need to compare it to the user's IP and
07:11 - that's been specified so let's just echo
07:14 - out user IP and check that that works
07:18 - within that function so IP exists and
07:21 - let's just give this a value of 1 and we
07:24 - can refresh now you can see that's still
07:27 - being echoed out however if I was to
07:30 - remove this global keyword and just try
07:32 - and echo out user IP you can see it
07:35 - doesn't work so we need to make this
07:36 - globally usable inside of our function
