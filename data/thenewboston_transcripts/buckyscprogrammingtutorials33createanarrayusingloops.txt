00:00 - alright guys welcome to your 33rd C++
00:03 - oral and in this story I'm going to
00:05 - teach you guys an easier and quicker way
00:07 - to create an array and that's through
00:10 - the use of loops so in the last tutorial
00:12 - I tell you guys what an array was and
00:14 - also that we can create an array using
00:16 - something called an array initializer
00:18 - list and this is actually pretty useful
00:20 - when you're dealing with smaller arrays
00:22 - but whenever we're working with bigger
00:24 - arrays say that store a hundred elements
00:27 - or a thousand elements we're going to
00:29 - need a quicker way to create that array
00:31 - instead of making a huge long list so
00:34 - let me go ahead and show you guys
00:35 - exactly how to do that so in our very
00:38 - first line we're going to declare our
00:40 - array we aren't going to set it equal to
00:42 - any values just yet so I'm going to make
00:44 - an array called Bucky and Bucky can hold
00:46 - nine integers so in this line of code
00:49 - we're pretty much telling our compiler
00:50 - and compiler whenever you run this
00:53 - program you better set aside some space
00:55 - in our memory enough space to hold a
00:57 - nine integers so our compiler says yes
01:00 - sir now what we need to do is well let
01:03 - me just go ahead and whenever I'm done
01:05 - with this tutorial I'm going to print
01:07 - out the elements on one side and the
01:08 - value so I might as well give it a nice
01:10 - little prompt now element and value so
01:19 - what we're going to be doing is we're
01:21 - just going to print out the element on
01:22 - one side and the value on the other side
01:25 - so let's go ahead and take a look at
01:26 - this right now one space for elements
01:29 - and I'm going to list those on this side
01:30 - and right across from it I'm going to
01:32 - list their values right here so we're
01:35 - saying all right you talk to talk now
01:37 - time to walk to walk one way to create
01:40 - an array like I said before is the use
01:42 - of loops and in this tutorial I'm going
01:43 - to be using the for loop so let's go
01:45 - ahead and see what parameters we add for
01:48 - this so we already know that whenever we
01:51 - create an array that holds the nine
01:52 - elements every array starts at zero so I
01:56 - think whenever we created this int X
01:58 - zero would be a good place to start and
02:00 - we also know that if we created an array
02:04 - that can hold nine integers the last
02:06 - index in that an array excuse me the
02:09 - less index in that array is going to be
02:11 - 8 because count with me get your fingers
02:14 - out 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 I only counted to
02:22 - 8 but since we had 0 in there that takes
02:24 - care of our 9 elements pretty cool huh
02:27 - so we only want to loop from 0 to 8 so
02:31 - that's why you're right X is less than 9
02:33 - we can make it easier X is less than or
02:36 - equal to 8 oops not X comment less than
02:40 - or equal to 8 either way it works fine X
02:42 - is less than 9 is a little bit quicker
02:44 - but you know what's one extra character
02:46 - so now of course we're going to use X
02:49 - plus plus the increment X by one each
02:51 - time so now whenever we see out X and
02:55 - line let's go just go ahead and run this
02:58 - real quick so I can show you guys we get
03:00 - that 0 through 8 and you're saying
03:03 - that's pretty cool
03:04 - so now we have the numbers 0 through 8
03:06 - and those just happen to be the exact
03:09 - numbers that we need in our array so now
03:12 - what we can do is something like this
03:13 - Bucky X equals 99 or something stupid so
03:20 - what this is going to do is it's going
03:22 - to go through your array each element
03:25 - one by one and assign the value 99 so
03:28 - the first time it loops it's going to
03:30 - set the Bucky zero element to 99 the
03:34 - next time the Bucky one element to 99 so
03:37 - it's basically going to set every
03:39 - element in your array to 99 until it
03:41 - gets to eight and then it's going to do
03:43 - it one more time and stop at 9 so pretty
03:45 - cool huh so let's go ahead and print
03:47 - this out and see exactly what I did so
03:50 - see out first we'll go ahead and print
03:52 - out X which is the element number same
03:55 - as this so this is going to be 0 through
03:59 - 8 on the left-hand side and now just go
04:02 - ahead and give us some space to work
04:03 - with
04:05 - and after this just go ahead and write
04:09 - the value of whatever element is stored
04:13 - in there so this is going to be 99 if we
04:16 - coded it correctly so let me go ahead
04:18 - and end this line and whenever I run
04:19 - this you guys will clearly see what's
04:21 - going on so what we did is we loop
04:24 - through each array element one at a time
04:26 - first Bucky 0 then Bucky 1 the monkey 2
04:30 - 3 4 all the way to 8 in each time we
04:33 - loop through it we set that element
04:35 - equal to 99 so now we have an array
04:39 - called Bucky that has nine elements 1 2
04:42 - 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and each of those elements
04:46 - is equal to the value of 99 there are
04:49 - actually a lot of nines in this soil but
04:52 - you know it's good number so you know it
04:54 - feels appropriate so let me talk you
04:57 - guys through this one more time in the
04:58 - code in this line of code we're
05:00 - basically declaring a 9 element Bucky
05:03 - array we're telling our computer make
05:05 - sure you set set aside enough space to
05:08 - hold 9 integers in the array Bucky so it
05:11 - that's what it did in this line and this
05:12 - line all we did was print out a title
05:14 - basically and in our loop we knew that
05:18 - since we're creating Bucky 9 array that
05:21 - the indexes that it need was 0 through 8
05:24 - so we made a simple loop that basically
05:27 - loop through the numbers 0 through 8 in
05:30 - with those numbers we could reference
05:33 - the Bucky element and assign it equal to
05:37 - the value of 99 for each one and then of
05:40 - course we just printed out the index
05:42 - which was 0 through 8 and then the value
05:45 - which was 99 each time so simple enough
05:48 - so that is basically two different ways
05:50 - to create an array um again whenever
05:54 - you're working with a really big arrays
05:55 - in I don't know it's just a lot easier
05:58 - than using an initializer list because
06:01 - if you created an initializer list with
06:04 - like a hundred values then you would go
06:05 - ahead and have to type a hundred values
06:07 - in here and it will just get messy
06:09 - really quick so this is a faster way um
06:12 - it takes a little more thinking but it's
06:14 - definitely worth it so for now that's
06:16 - all I have for you guys thank you
06:17 - thanks for watching don't forget
06:18 - subscribe and I will see you next door
06:19 - Oh
