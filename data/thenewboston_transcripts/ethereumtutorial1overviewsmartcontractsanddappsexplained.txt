00:00 - what up what up welcome back to another
00:02 - tutorial series and in this one we're
00:04 - going to be learning ethereum
00:06 - so question number one what the heck is
00:09 - ethereum
00:10 - all right good question
00:12 - so ethereum is a whole new way to both
00:14 - create and transfer value that's open to
00:17 - anyone in the world
00:18 - now more technically ethereum is a
00:22 - decentralized computer network that
00:24 - executes
00:25 - programs called smart contracts now
00:27 - through the use of these smart contracts
00:32 - developers can do many things but one of
00:34 - the more interesting and probably well
00:36 - known
00:37 - is creating many different types of
00:39 - digital assets these include digital
00:42 - artwork and collectibles now these are
00:44 - typically what people think of whenever
00:46 - they hear the term nft but there's
00:48 - actually a lot more to nfts than just
00:50 - art as we're going to be seeing later on
00:52 - aside from those
00:54 - another popular type of digital asset is
00:57 - in-game items
00:58 - and these may include things like skins
01:01 - or weapons basically anything that you
01:04 - could buy in an in-game economy and some
01:07 - of the more interesting but lesser-known
01:09 - use cases
01:11 - are actually digital representations of
01:13 - real world items and these may include
01:16 - things like tickets to some real world
01:18 - concert or event or movie perhaps or
01:21 - even a d to a house or a car
01:23 - and believe it or not you can actually
01:25 - even create your very own virtual
01:28 - currency and the use cases for that are
01:30 - really up to your imagination smart
01:32 - contracts are also used to instruct the
01:34 - network how to assign ownership of these
01:37 - assets for example
01:39 - there could be a game that could use
01:41 - smart contracts to transfer ownership of
01:43 - rare items to players who completed a
01:45 - quest or something along those lines so
01:48 - for example if this user completed a
01:50 - quest
01:51 - maybe there would be a pool of rare
01:53 - items and this user would get this uh
01:55 - helmet i guess it is and this other user
01:58 - let's give them this sword that's pretty
02:00 - cool so something along those lines now
02:02 - there are also many other use cases for
02:04 - smart contracts but we'll get into those
02:07 - later on in the course now combining
02:09 - these smart contracts with user
02:11 - interfaces developers can create a
02:13 - variety of dapps in dap just stands for
02:16 - decentralized app
02:18 - and they can include things like
02:20 - marketplaces exchanges games and so on
02:23 - so dapps are just smart contracts plus a
02:27 - user interface so what are the
02:29 - technological benefits of decentralized
02:31 - apps or dapps as these young
02:34 - whippersnappers call them so the
02:36 - technological benefits are actually very
02:38 - closely related to the overall ethereum
02:40 - architecture as a whole
02:42 - and by that i mean for one there's zero
02:45 - downtime
02:46 - and that's because on a peer-to-peer
02:47 - network as we see here there is no
02:50 - single point of failure
02:52 - another benefit is privacy
02:55 - developers and users don't need to
02:57 - provide their real world identity to
02:59 - either build these apps or interact with
03:02 - them so that's another plus and also
03:05 - they're censorship resistant by that i
03:08 - mean that no single entity on the
03:10 - ethereum network could ever block users
03:13 - from creating or using these dapps and
03:16 - that is also because this network
03:18 - is indeed open to anyone in the world so
03:20 - the ethereum network as a whole is very
03:22 - open transparent and verifiable and
03:26 - that's because every node in this
03:28 - network and we're going to see exactly
03:30 - how this happens later on but every node
03:32 - in this network is essentially
03:33 - responsible for keeping an eye on each
03:35 - other and making sure that there's no
03:37 - cheating or tomfoolery going on now
03:40 - another common question that people have
03:42 - especially when they're first starting
03:43 - to learn about ethereum is how is
03:45 - ethereum different than bitcoin
03:48 - so ethereum and bitcoin both do use a
03:51 - blockchain architecture and we're going
03:54 - to be getting into the details of what
03:56 - all that means later on
03:57 - but for now i do want to point out that
03:59 - ethereum's primary use case
04:02 - is not just to be a digital currency
04:04 - like bitcoin it's more so to offer value
04:07 - in utility through a growing network of
04:10 - dapps now with that i would like to say
04:12 - that in this course what we're going to
04:14 - be doing is going over some core
04:16 - concepts regarding ethereum
04:18 - and i also want to mention that this
04:20 - course is mostly geared to developers
04:23 - however it is useful for anyone who's
04:25 - just interested in learning more about
04:28 - ethereum for whatever reason
04:30 - and i just want to point this out
04:31 - because
04:32 - specifically this is not a course on
04:34 - trading or investment advice it's more
04:37 - for people who are interested in the
04:39 - ethereum technology or who want to learn
04:41 - how to build on the ethereum network now
04:44 - the last thing that i want to mention is
04:45 - that if anyone has any questions
04:47 - throughout this course then feel free to
04:49 - join our discord by going to our website
04:52 - thenewboston.com
04:53 - and it's here at the moment under
04:55 - resources if you go to join the
04:57 - community
04:58 - then you can click on the link to our
05:00 - discord and by the way i'm thinking of
05:02 - adding a category on the left for either
05:04 - crypto or blockchain so by the time you
05:07 - all join uh just keep an eye out for
05:09 - that but either way our discord
05:11 - community is awesome it's probably your
05:13 - best bet for any questions we have a
05:15 - super helpful community and pretty fun
05:17 - too actually so
05:19 - um anyways getting kind of sidetracked
05:21 - here another resource is our reddit
05:24 - so that's reddit.com
05:26 - r the new boston feel free to join this
05:29 - ask any questions uh about ethereum
05:31 - suggestions feedback so on and so forth
05:34 - and last but not least how can i forget
05:36 - the ethereum subreddit
05:39 - so
05:40 - this of course for obvious reasons is
05:42 - one of the best resources for
05:44 - ethereum any questions feel free to ask
05:47 - here and a lot of people there i believe
05:50 - how many is it 1.2 million right now so
05:53 - somewhere in these communities someone
05:55 - is going to be able to help out any
05:57 - questions that you have
05:59 - so yeah uh on that note i am pretty
06:01 - pumped up looking forward to this entire
06:03 - series so thank you for watching don't
