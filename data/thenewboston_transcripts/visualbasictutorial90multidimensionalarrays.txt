00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - OnLive gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to be talking
00:07 - about multi-dimensional arrays now the
00:10 - best way for me to explain this is think
00:13 - of a graph and on that graph you have
00:16 - points so let's say you have the point
00:18 - 35 well when you make a
00:20 - multi-dimensional array it's pretty much
00:22 - a graph so when you reference point 35
00:25 - you can hold an item there and you can
00:27 - also hold an item at 36 or 37 and it's
00:31 - just a big 2D graph of um different
00:35 - items that you want to store so let's go
00:37 - ahead and make a little demo project and
00:39 - work some with multi-dimensional arrays
00:42 - so we go ahead and select new
00:46 - project and we will select Windows forms
00:49 - application and we will set the name
00:53 - to um let's just do we'll do
00:57 - 2D
00:58 - arrays and we'll go ahead and click okay
01:01 - and wait for that to
01:17 - load okay so we'll go ahead and Shrink
01:21 - our formula a little bit here and we're
01:23 - going to add a button and two text
01:28 - boxes so let's go over here to to our
01:30 - toolbox we'll select
01:32 - button and where's the text box right
01:36 - here and we'll add another text
01:41 - box okay so we'll just go ahead and
01:43 - Shrink this down a little bit okay so
01:46 - let's go ahead and set the text property
01:48 - for button one to um get array
01:53 - element and we'll make it bigger so
01:55 - it'll all show
01:57 - up and we will set the name
02:02 - to button get
02:05 - element and we'll set the text box one
02:08 - to um
02:11 - text First
02:14 - Dimension and the next one to text third
02:18 - dimens I mean second
02:24 - dimension okay so we'll go ahead and
02:26 - double click on get array
02:28 - element and we will zoom in here now
02:31 - let's come up here and create an array
02:34 - now this isn't going to be any type of
02:36 - array this is going to be a
02:37 - multi-dimensional array now the way we
02:39 - do this is we can type the word the
02:41 - keyword
02:43 - private then we will type the name of
02:46 - our array so we'll just type um
02:50 - multiarray and now inside of our
02:53 - parentheses we're going to specify how
02:55 - many dimensions it has now we can do
02:57 - this by just
02:58 - typing two and
03:01 - comma two and now we have to specify a
03:05 - type so we'll just do
03:07 - string okay so what this means is that
03:11 - the array is going to have is going to
03:13 - be two long and two down so picture a
03:16 - grid and um picture it three across and
03:19 - three down so a square of three across
03:20 - and three down because this starts with
03:22 - zero so it Go 012 across uh 012 and
03:28 - 012 so our
03:31 - uh bottom right hand corner corner of
03:34 - that would be 22 and the top would be 0
03:37 - 0 so let's go ahead and this might be a
03:39 - little confusing to you let's go ahead
03:41 - and assign some values for this so we
03:43 - will type multiarray and we will assign
03:47 - 0
03:49 - 0 and we will set that equal to
03:52 - hello or let's do
03:56 - um
03:58 - position 0
04:01 - 0 and we will do that for some of the
04:04 - other spots in the array so we'll do 0
04:09 - one and then we will set the text
04:12 - to
04:14 - position
04:17 - 01 and we'll do that one more
04:25 - time and let's just copy
04:28 - this
04:33 - okay so now what we want to do is we
04:35 - want to show whichever one they've
04:36 - picked in a message box so they will
04:39 - type the let's say this is the X length
04:42 - um because we're looking at a grid so
04:45 - this right here would be X and then this
04:46 - right here would be Y and if you have a
04:49 - three-dimensional array you could use
04:50 - the z um the Z line but we aren't doing
04:55 - that in this tutorial so this is the X
04:57 - position and this is the Y position and
05:00 - unlike a normal grid which starts in the
05:02 - uh in the middle let's say you have like
05:06 - a a cross um in Visual Basic it's just
05:10 - like a big
05:17 - Square so in Visual Basic it starts from
05:21 - let's say the top right hand corner so
05:23 - it would start up here and it would go
05:25 - like let's say three across and then two
05:28 - down instead of starting in the middle
05:32 - so let's go ahead and get what the user
05:34 - has typed
05:36 - in so we'll
05:39 - type messagebox do
05:45 - show and let's come up here and store
05:48 - what they typed in a couple variables
05:49 - first so dim
05:52 - Exposition as integer and we will set
05:56 - that equal to uh C type
06:00 - so we're going to convert what they got
06:02 - we'll type text first
06:04 - dimension. text and then we will convert
06:07 - that to an integer type so then we'll
06:11 - declare y position as integer and we
06:15 - will
06:17 - convert the text second
06:21 - dimension. text to an
06:24 - integer okay so now we're going to go
06:26 - ahead and show the position so we'll
06:28 - type message box show multiarray and
06:32 - then we will type X position and Y
06:37 - position so what this is going to do is
06:39 - it's going to get the string at um
06:41 - whatever they typed in for x and
06:42 - whatever they typed in for y now
06:44 - currently we only have three possible
06:46 - answers so let's go ahead and run that
06:47 - and see what
06:50 - happens so we will do
06:54 - Zer and one and get a right element we
06:57 - get position 01
07:00 - and we can do 02 and we get position
07:03 - 02 so go ahead make some
07:06 - multi-dimensional arrays um and you can
07:08 - fill in each of the items in the array
07:10 - so if I were to um fill in the next part
07:13 - of the array I would do something like 1
07:17 - Z and then 1 one and then one two and
07:20 - then uh two 0 2 1 2 two so go ahead you
07:24 - can make that and set the values for it
07:26 - and uh make a little program that lets
07:28 - you type in the X pos position and the Y
07:31 - position so that you can get whatever is
07:33 - stored at that um and then once you've
07:35 - practiced a little bit with
07:36 - multi-dimensional arrays go ahead and
07:38 - move on to the next tutorial and thanks
07:39 - for
07:40 - watching
