00:00 - hello everyone my name is Sarah and in
00:03 - this video we are going to cover some
00:05 - organic and biochemistry fun stuff right
00:08 - this is still just uh introduction
00:10 - introductory material so it's not going
00:13 - to be explained in a lot of detail but
00:17 - as with a lot of other things I've
00:18 - already covered I will be explaining it
00:20 - in much greater detail in future videos
00:23 - I just can't fit everything into one
00:25 - 10-minute
00:26 - video anyways cells are basically just
00:30 - tiny little chemical factories they're
00:32 - constantly working to break down build
00:35 - or modify
00:37 - compounds cells contain both organic
00:39 - compounds which contain hydrogen and
00:41 - carbon in a chemical combination and
00:44 - also inorganic compounds which do not
00:46 - contain carbon and hydrogen in a
00:48 - chemical compound this is not to say
00:50 - that inorganic compounds cannot contain
00:52 - carbon for example diamond is made of
00:55 - carbon however diamond is not a an
00:59 - organic comp compound since pretty much
01:01 - all the chemistry that happens within a
01:03 - cell is organic chemistry that's what
01:05 - I'm going to be talking about in this
01:07 - video we're going to cover lipids
01:08 - carbohydrates proteins and nucleic
01:12 - acids before I cover those things though
01:14 - I'm just going to introduce you guys to
01:16 - a couple of functional groups that are
01:17 - found in organic molecules that will be
01:20 - important for you to know later on we
01:22 - start off with hydroxy groups um you
01:25 - have an oxygen and a hydrogen these are
01:28 - known as alcohols and they have the
01:31 - formula R which stands for pretty much
01:33 - any other carbon hydrogen Group whatever
01:36 - o which is your hydroxy group an example
01:39 - would be ethanol or your typical alcohol
01:42 - what's found in beer vodka teila
01:44 - whatever excuse me as you can see here
01:48 - there are two carbons and your hydroxy
01:52 - group we next have carbonal groups which
01:55 - have the function C with a double bonded
01:58 - oxygen and
02:00 - two other groups on either side you have
02:02 - ketones and aldhy the only difference
02:05 - between ketones and aldhy is that one of
02:08 - the r groups has to be a hydrogen for an
02:12 - aldah an example of a ketone would be
02:15 - acetone or nail polish remover and an
02:18 - example of an alahh is a seed alahh
02:21 - which is believed to cause hangovers
02:24 - when you drink too much of
02:26 - this you can see the double bonded
02:29 - oxygen and the hydrogen for the aldah
02:32 - and the double bonded oxygen and these
02:36 - two methyl groups for the
02:39 - Ketone carboxy groups have the chemical
02:41 - formula c o um these are known as
02:45 - carboxilic acids and the general
02:48 - structure is a c double bonded o and
02:51 - then you have a hydroxy group here
02:54 - that's very it's very important to
02:55 - remember the difference between carboxy
02:57 - and carbonal groups um and example of a
03:00 - carboxilic acid is acetic acid also
03:04 - known as vinegar you can see here you've
03:07 - got your carbon double bonded oxygen
03:11 - hydroxy group right
03:13 - here we next have amino group which are
03:16 - called amines these are a
03:19 - nitrogen and bound to some other organic
03:23 - molecule an example would be
03:27 - ethylamine and you can see here n hren
03:30 - to hydrogen there are different
03:32 - classifications of amines you have
03:35 - primary amines secondary amines and
03:37 - tertiary
03:39 - Ames this has to do with the number of
03:42 - hydrogens attached to the nitrogen a
03:46 - primary amine has two hydrogens on the
03:49 - nitrogen secondary amine has one
03:53 - hydrogen and two R groups and a tertiary
03:56 - I mean does not have any hydrogens
03:58 - instead it's all R groups
04:00 - next we have
04:01 - phosphates you have a phosphorus three
04:05 - oxygens excuse me four oxygen one one
04:09 - one one and a double bonded oxygen and
04:11 - this has a charge of
04:14 - -2 this is what is called a polyatomic
04:17 - ion but anyways an example of a
04:21 - phosphate would be glucose 6 phosphate
04:24 - glucose is a carbohydrate a sugar here
04:27 - you can see the phosphate attached
04:30 - to the sixth carbon right
04:33 - here and the last one is a sulf hydro
04:36 - group or thol or mer captons an example
04:41 - is butane thol four carbons sulfur
04:46 - hydrogen and thil are sulfur containing
04:50 - groups think of it as a sulfur alcohol
