00:00 - so what we do is we first of all check
00:03 - if options are available so if the user
00:05 - has specified options
00:07 - and then we extend which is essentially
00:09 - just merging uh two
00:12 - objects or arrays in this case together
00:14 - and we want to merge or extend settings
00:18 - to options
00:20 - so now what we've done is we've just
00:22 - basically taken values and then combined
00:25 - them with the pre-default settings that
00:27 - we've created here
00:29 - that's really all there is to it so when
00:31 - i whenever i'm creating a jquery plug-in
00:34 - and i'm using this notation i always go
00:36 - ahead and alert out
00:38 - one of my settings so i know that it's
00:40 - actually working so we're going to go
00:42 - ahead and alert our settings and because
00:44 - of course this is an array we're going
00:46 - to alert out
00:47 - color
00:48 - so inside ext.js let's just go ahead and
00:51 - apply this plug-in to the document so
00:53 - it's uh dot highlight
00:55 - and then inside let's not specify
00:57 - anything at all and let's refresh
00:59 - you can see that we've got null returned
01:01 - here
01:02 - that's obviously because like i said
01:03 - this is the default value
01:05 - i haven't supplied any
01:07 - sort of
01:08 - options or settings inside of here
01:10 - therefore null is the correct is the
01:13 - predefined or default value if it was
01:16 - yellow and i refreshed we get the value
01:18 - yellow up
01:19 - so now what we want to do is i'm going
01:21 - to go ahead and change that back to null
01:24 - and i'm gonna actually supply uh some
01:27 - you know options to this plugin so let's
01:30 - go ahead and type in
01:33 - color which is the name of my option
01:35 - remember over here my name the name of
01:37 - my option here
01:39 - and color is going to be yellow so now
01:42 - that i've actually supplied it we have
01:44 - this if option so this equals true we
01:46 - extend it in and then this takes over
01:49 - this value so now when i refresh you see
01:51 - we get yellow
01:53 - if i was to go ahead and inside of here
01:55 - specify this as red or red rather not
01:58 - read and refresh you can see we've got
02:00 - red so we've now successfully passed
02:02 - this
02:03 - you know parameter or this
02:06 - setting to our plugin
02:08 - so now what we can go ahead and do is
02:10 - use this.css
02:12 - and we can set the background color
02:15 - to
02:16 - settings
02:18 - color because we've already echoed this
02:20 - setting out so we know that it works so
02:22 - we can go ahead and use css to set the
02:23 - background color in this case
02:25 - so let's go ahead and refresh
02:28 - oh let's go ahead and specify color
02:33 - color
02:37 - and change that
02:38 - there
02:39 - in actual fact no we don't need that
02:41 - sorry i forgot to actually go ahead and
02:43 - apply it to something relevant
02:45 - we used this without the dollar sign and
02:48 - whatever else because we've used this
02:50 - notation here
02:51 - we're not required to inside of our
02:52 - plugin we're setting the background
02:54 - color to the settings specified as we've
02:56 - already talked about here so in this
02:57 - case it's red
02:59 - um
03:00 - let's go ahead and actually apply this
03:02 - to something relevant and in this case
03:04 - it's the strong tags or in this case
03:06 - every strong tag on the page so now when
03:08 - we refresh you see that the background
03:10 - is highlighted with red
03:12 - we can go ahead and then specify
03:14 - something like yellow for example and
03:15 - refresh and you can see that it does
03:17 - exactly the same thing
03:19 - now let's go ahead and look at what we
03:20 - want to do if we want to add a second
03:22 - option into here so essentially what we
03:24 - do is we might say foreground
03:28 - black or foreground white for example
03:32 - so what this would do is we're supplying
03:34 - the first which is the highlight color
03:36 - and then the foreground color we can do
03:39 - as well so let's go ahead and modify our
03:41 - plugin
03:43 - i'm going to go ahead and pull this down
03:44 - here
03:47 - and i'm going to comma onto the end of
03:49 - here and i'm going to say 4
03:51 - ground
03:53 - null so by default it's nothing
03:55 - let's just pull that down a little bit
03:56 - more
03:57 - if options this line we don't need to
03:59 - change because we're still extending the
04:01 - options given to our predefined setting
04:03 - array so we're extending them settings
04:05 - to our options we're then saying
04:07 - this.css background color is settings
04:10 - color but now we can again say this.css
04:13 - or this dot css
04:16 - color which is obviously the foreground
04:18 - color in css and we can supply
04:21 - foreground from our settings so we've
04:24 - quite easily added in another option
04:26 - here which is foreground
04:28 - and this won't take effect just at the
04:30 - moment but if we go ahead and specify
04:33 - foreground
04:34 - let's say red in here
04:36 - you'll see that that's transferred
04:38 - through to our plugin using the
04:40 - foreground option there we merge and
04:43 - then we use this settings array to
04:45 - change the color using css in
04:49 - jquery
04:50 - so in this tutorial we've learned how we
04:52 - can obviously create our function which
04:55 - you should have already known i guess if
04:56 - you're watching this from the other
04:58 - videos
04:59 - we pre-define our settings in my case i
05:02 - always choose them as null
05:03 - however if you wanted the default for
05:06 - background color to be yellow and the
05:09 - default
05:10 - foreground to black or hash naught or
05:12 - naught
05:13 - you would do that
05:15 - and then
05:17 - we merge the settings with the options
05:19 - that are given so we can then use them
05:21 - use the user settings and we use this
05:23 - array to access each one so we've
05:26 - created more or less a pointless
05:29 - plugin but it has demonstrated how that
05:32 - we how we pass options uh to our plugin
05:36 - and actually make use of them
