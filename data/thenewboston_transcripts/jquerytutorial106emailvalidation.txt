00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog
00:02 - with video tutorial for the new boston
00:04 - in this video we're going to be taking a
00:07 - look at creating an email validation
00:08 - field which you could go ahead and
00:11 - implement into your foot into a form on
00:14 - your website if you require it the way
00:18 - it works is we click in here and we have
00:20 - this message saying go ahead type a
00:22 - valid email address so when we go ahead
00:25 - and start to actually type a valid email
00:27 - address we have this feedback here which
00:30 - is just a span area just feed us back
00:33 - some information about what we're typing
00:35 - inside this field so at the moment it
00:37 - says that's not quite a valid email
00:39 - address if I then go on and continue to
00:41 - type you'll also see that something like
00:45 - Alex at PHP academy' would be regarded
00:49 - as a valid email address for example it
00:51 - could be something like local host here
00:54 - this is just the way that PHP validates
00:59 - email addresses with the filter Val
01:01 - function however you could then go on
01:04 - adapt it to check for a TLD at the end
01:10 - although dog then still a valid email
01:14 - address so we're concentrating on the
01:16 - jQuery side of this and we are going to
01:18 - be using PHP to build the backend that's
01:21 - actually going to validate this form
01:23 - we're not actually using jQuery to
01:25 - validate it so we're using PHP
01:28 - essentially to validate and then
01:30 - feedback the response from you know the
01:33 - text that's been typed in here by the
01:35 - user back to the user so whichever way
01:39 - you choose to validate you can apply
01:41 - this to a variety of other different
01:44 - fields as well in a form obviously you
01:47 - wouldn't go ahead and just copy and
01:48 - paste the code that we're about to write
01:50 - but you could find a way to pick up on
01:52 - each of the fields and validate them
01:55 - separately maybe create a global type
01:58 - for a field for example text and then
02:00 - supply it with a specific amount of data
02:03 - however for the purpose of this example
02:05 - application we're looking at filtering
02:08 - an email address and feeding back
02:10 - information
02:11 - to the user okay so let's go ahead and
02:15 - start to build our basic form we also
02:19 - need to include Ajax j/s which is the
02:21 - file that's going to handle all of our
02:22 - jQuery then we're going to go ahead and
02:25 - a bit later on create a PHP file which
02:27 - is going to be you know the file that
02:29 - processes all this information let's
02:31 - just take a look at our directory
02:33 - structure we've got this folder called
02:34 - j/s where this ajax file is located
02:38 - this one here and obviously jQuery as
02:40 - well we've already included jQuery into
02:42 - our page however we need to go ahead and
02:45 - include this Ajax jas father I have open
02:48 - in my text editor and that's the jQuery
02:51 - that's going to handle the events and
02:53 - everything inside of our room inside of
02:55 - our page as well as handling the Ajax
02:58 - post requests so that's that we're going
03:02 - to go on later and create a file inside
03:04 - the our PHP folder which is going to
03:06 - handle the requests sent by our Ajax jes
03:10 - file so step one is to go ahead and
03:13 - include this Ajax file into our page so
03:17 - I'm going to go ahead and create some
03:19 - script tags type is text forward slash
03:22 - JavaScript and the source is js4 slash
03:25 - Ajax jas so now that's included we can
03:29 - start to create some jQuery code or
03:32 - writes and jQuery code inside this Ajax
03:34 - j/s file and that's going to handle the
03:37 - form we're just about to create or the
03:39 - field that we're just about to create so
03:42 - I'm going to create a label here just
03:44 - saying email and then I'm going to go
03:45 - ahead and create an input field okay so
03:50 - the input field type is going to be text
03:52 - we're just asking for the user to type
03:54 - text in we're also then going to give
03:59 - this an ID and that's just going to be
04:01 - email now just one point I'd like to
04:03 - make I am using html5 and you can
04:06 - actually give the type email so you can
04:10 - now specify email from html5 they've
04:14 - created a validation here however what's
04:17 - happening is you're validating on the
04:19 - front end
04:20 - and at the time of recording this video
04:23 - html5 is a touchy subject when it comes
04:26 - to browser support let's just open our
04:29 - browser and take a look at this example
04:30 - if I was to go ahead and type Alex at
04:33 - PHP and if I was to submit this form
04:37 - let's just go ahead and create a submit
04:38 - button ok so if I was to go ahead and
04:47 - submit this form with just say Alex in
04:49 - here we have this or we should do anyway
04:52 - because we're not using a form that's
04:54 - just there we are okay so when I click
05:00 - Submit you see this you know little div
05:04 - or whatever it would would be pops up
05:06 - just saying please enter an email
05:07 - address so html5 is now validating on
05:11 - the front-end
05:12 - now the downfall to this that I've
05:14 - already explained is that html5 you know
05:17 - is you know not entirely compatible at
05:19 - the time of recording this video so
05:21 - depending on when you're watching it
05:23 - html5 is you know one of them things
05:27 - that is not compatible with some
05:29 - browsers in some areas the other reason
05:34 - is is that back-end
05:35 - validation is genuine generally more
05:38 - reliable and can be tailored with
05:42 - regards to you know what exactly what
05:45 - you want to look for if you were to do
05:47 - everything in JavaScript if you to do
05:49 - all the email validation in JavaScript
05:51 - you would you know users would be able
05:54 - to get around this so we need to
05:55 - validate in the backend somehow so
05:58 - that's just a quick explanation as to
06:00 - why this example is in place we're going
06:03 - to keep this as typed text just so the
06:05 - user can type some text in and if you
06:08 - are choosing not to use html5 then this
06:10 - method will be you know useful to you
06:13 - okay so now that we've done that let's
06:15 - just refresh we've already seen this
06:17 - somewhat now the first thing that we
06:19 - need to do is when the user clicks into
06:21 - here so when it becomes in focus we need
06:25 - to display some text here
