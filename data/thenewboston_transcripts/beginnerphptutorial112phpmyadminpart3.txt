00:02 - okay so you can see a few things that we
00:05 - uh are returned with here the first
00:07 - thing we see is a confirmation we've got
00:08 - a little tick here saying one row
00:10 - inserted which we have inserted one row
00:13 - um and row ID one okay so that's our um
00:16 - incr our autoincrement
00:18 - value so here we have a query that's
00:21 - been constructed for us and shown back
00:23 - to us and remember earlier I've talked
00:25 - about queries and how they can insert
00:27 - data here we've got insert into a
00:31 - database so we're inserting into this
00:33 - database do users so we're accessing
00:36 - this database and this table ID username
00:40 - and password and then with the values
00:43 - null for ID we're not specifying
00:45 - anything because it's automatically
00:47 - going to increment for us Alex and
00:49 - password so null corresponds to ID Alex
00:52 - corresponds to username and password
00:54 - corresponds to password which is the
00:57 - password I gave this could be obviously
00:59 - anything
01:00 - so now what we can do is we can click on
01:02 - this browse Tab and we can go back and
01:04 - have a look at our data so this is a
01:06 - representation of our data inside the
01:09 - database so let's uh insert another row
01:13 - let's call this this time Billy and pass
01:16 - one 2 3 I'm going to click
01:19 - go so now we've inserted another row
01:22 - with ID 2 now remember that's Auto
01:25 - incrementing and we've performing more
01:27 - or less the same query but just with
01:29 - different values use let's go back to
01:31 - browse okay you can see the data here
01:34 - now browse won't be available if there
01:35 - isn't any data inside your inside your
01:37 - table however structure is what we were
01:39 - looking at before remember we can always
01:41 - go back to this and change things around
01:43 - if we want to for example now if we
01:45 - change password to a numeric
01:48 - data our passwords here would now be
01:50 - invalid so they'd be uh they'd be gotten
01:52 - rid
01:54 - of Okay so we've got an idea of one and
01:57 - two you can see these Auto incremented
01:59 - and we've got got username and password
02:01 - now we're going to now what we're going
02:04 - to be doing is adding another row onto
02:07 - this now we've already specified data
02:09 - you can imagine this maybe say hundreds
02:11 - and hundreds of uh rows of data however
02:14 - now what we want to do is we want to add
02:16 - on um let's say a first name and a
02:18 - surname so how do we go about doing this
02:21 - well we come over to the structure Tab
02:23 - and this can be done even though we've
02:24 - already got data ins stored inside our
02:26 - database what we can do here is we've
02:29 - got add a certain amount of fields at
02:31 - the end of the table at the beginning of
02:33 - the table or after a specified field in
02:36 - our table so what I want to do is I want
02:38 - to say at the end of the table I want to
02:40 - add two fields and I'm going to click go
02:44 - now we've got two Fields up that we can
02:45 - specify everything in here so I'm going
02:47 - to say first name and I'm going to say
02:50 - surname and these types are obviously
02:52 - going to be varar and considering some
02:54 - people's surnames might be really long
02:56 - uh I'm going to go for uh let's say 40
02:59 - characters
03:00 - say 40 and 40 just to be safe so now I
03:03 - can come down I don't need to specify
03:05 - any other data inside
03:07 - here and I'm going to click on
03:12 - Save okay so you can see our query here
03:15 - has been uh uh read back to us we've got
03:18 - alter table users add first name varart
03:22 - not null so it has to contain some data
03:25 - add surname V 40 not n so this is our
03:29 - quick the to alter our table and add two
03:32 - field names at the end of the table so
03:35 - now you can see that we've if we click
03:37 - on well sorry about that we click on
03:38 - browse if we click on structure we can
03:40 - see that we've got our two um added on
03:43 - here all the relevant data if we click
03:45 - on browse you can see that we've now
03:47 - added two um field names on but
03:50 - obviously there's no data specified but
03:53 - what we can do now is we can click on
03:54 - edit and we can change
03:58 - this
04:02 - so we can then go ahead and change Billy
04:04 - as
04:06 - well and click
04:10 - go so we can see that um we've been
04:14 - given back again another query so every
04:17 - time we perform a query in uh PHP my
04:20 - admin it usefully gives us the query
04:22 - back so if you're struggling to
04:25 - understand the concept of queries and
04:27 - how to structure them and what they do
04:29 - and how they work later on then uh a
04:32 - really good thing to do is just play
04:34 - around inside here insert things delete
04:36 - things change things and uh just take
04:39 - note of the query so in this case what
04:41 - we've done is we've updated a particular
04:44 - uh
04:45 - row
04:46 - um in this case we've updated the Billy
04:49 - Garrett row so we've updated uh the one
04:51 - with the ID of two so we our query reads
04:55 - update um users table inside a database
04:59 - um um and we're setting first name
05:02 - equals Billy and surname equals Garrett
05:05 - where users. ID equals 2 so with the ID
05:08 - of this equals two set first name to
05:10 - Billy and surname to Garrett okay and
05:13 - limit one just means we're obviously uh
05:16 - not doing this for anything else it's
05:18 - just sort of something that you don't
05:20 - need to add on but you know might be
05:24 - beneficial
05:26 - so let's uh return to um
05:30 - our data so you can see that this all
05:32 - updated now you can perform uh a variety
05:35 - of operations inside PHP my admin it's
05:38 - an extremely powerful tool so maybe
05:41 - before you start using uh queries and
05:43 - things inside PHP have a play around
05:46 - here and just understand how MySQL and
05:49 - its structure and its data types and how
05:52 - to do things work uh and then go on to
05:55 - um the PHP side of things but for now
05:59 - that's just a quick introduction to PHP
06:00 - my admin um how to use it in the ways
06:04 - that we're going to be talking about
06:05 - with the tutorials there's obviously a
06:07 - lot more functionality behind it um but
06:09 - that's just a brief introduction and how
06:11 - to perform simple
06:13 - operations
