00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - continuing working on the game
00:09 - so whenever the timer ticks that is used
00:13 - to delay the attack what we want to do
00:15 - is call enemy attack now we haven't
00:18 - created this sub yet so let's go ahead
00:20 - and come down here we'll type private
00:22 - sub enemy attack so whenever they attack
00:29 - what we want to do is type current enemy
00:34 - dot attack so you may be wondering if
00:40 - you already typed this code in why this
00:43 - hasn't shown up well the reason is
00:46 - because I went into each one of these
00:47 - classes and change the attack names or
00:50 - the names of the subs to just attack
00:51 - instead of say zombie attack or villain
00:57 - attack so go ahead
00:58 - ignore the overloads that I have there
01:03 - let's see so change each one of those to
01:09 - attack and then come back in to form one
01:13 - DB so current enemy dot attack and then
01:17 - after we do that what we want to do is
01:21 - update the progress bar so progress bar
01:26 - Popeye dot value is going to be equal to
01:30 - hero dot now you can see that we're
01:33 - getting an error right here that's
01:35 - because we need to reference user health
01:38 - as integer so we'll just type hero
01:41 - health so that we can access the
01:44 - property health now all we need to do is
01:47 - enclose this in a try block so we will
01:51 - try to set the value to the current
01:53 - health of Popeye and if it's below zero
01:57 - it will throw an error and we'll be
01:59 - ready to catch that error so if that
02:03 - happens what we want to do is type
02:04 - message box dot Show Popeye has
02:10 - and then we will type here o dot health
02:15 - equals 100 so it pretty much responds
02:19 - him and then we need to set progress bar
02:21 - pop I dot value equals 0 dot health so
02:26 - we'll update the progress bar and then
02:29 - after all this has done what we need to
02:32 - do is stop the timer
02:33 - so timer delay dot stop and then the
02:39 - timer will be started back up again when
02:41 - they click attack now in order for us to
02:44 - use this attack method right here it may
02:47 - be different for each one of the enemies
02:50 - and it will be different so we've got a
02:51 - default attack inside of enemy
02:55 - it says attack it used to be default
02:57 - attack but I changed it to attack so if
03:01 - we just just leave this the way it is
03:02 - it's going to always call the attack
03:05 - that's used in enemy because we declared
03:08 - current enemy of type enemy so what we
03:11 - need to do is come into our enemy DB
03:14 - class and we need to come into public
03:18 - sub attack and we need to make it over
03:22 - writable so now we can override the
03:24 - attack sub in each one of our classes
03:27 - that inherits from enemy so we'll open
03:30 - up dragon and we need to type overrides
03:34 - so this attack overrides to the one an
03:37 - enemy and we'll do that for each one of
03:39 - these so that it uses the appropriate
03:43 - attack sub each time we call it whenever
03:46 - the villain attacks so public overrides
03:53 - and let's come down here and see what
03:56 - our error is uh-huh so let's make that
04:00 - usual health- equals 8 so we'll minimize
04:04 - out of this let's go ahead and come into
04:07 - form 1 and we will run this and
04:10 - hopefully everything will work fine so
04:13 - we can go ahead and attack it takes away
04:15 - some health and then a second later he
04:16 - attacks us we can attack again takes
04:19 - away some health and then he attacks us
04:21 - we can use spinach and then he attack
04:23 - that's again and then each time it will
04:28 - attack so we can attack one more time
04:30 - he'll attack back and then the last time
04:34 - it says Popeye as one and it spawns a
04:36 - new enemy
04:37 - now Popeye barely has any health left so
04:40 - if we attack the enemy the enemy attacks
04:42 - us you can see that Popeye dies and we
04:49 - have created an infinite loop so what we
04:52 - need to do is to find out where this is
04:55 - so we'll just copy this right here and
05:04 - we'll stop the timer before this has
05:06 - done okay so now let's go ahead let's
05:11 - make Popeye lose on the first try so
05:13 - we'll come into the zombie and whenever
05:15 - he eats brains Popeye will lose 50 so
05:18 - we'll open this up and let's spawn an
05:20 - enemy until we get a zombie so here's
05:22 - our zombie we will attack the zombie and
05:24 - then the autonomy I'm the autonomy the
05:27 - zombie will attack back we can attack
05:29 - again and let's wait until it gets the
05:33 - eat brain so you can see that a whole
05:34 - bunch goes away there we can attack
05:36 - again and you see that Popeye loses and
05:41 - Popeye responds so in order to make this
05:45 - look a little bit better let's come back
05:48 - into form on BB and whenever he attacks
05:50 - let's go ahead and update this to zero
05:58 - so before it shows the message box we
06:00 - will type progress for our Popeye dot
06:03 - value equals zero so that the user will
06:06 - see the value and know that he is dead
06:09 - so then we'll come over here to button
06:12 - attack and we'll do that for this tomb
06:14 - so if it's below zero then progress bar
06:19 - enemy thought value equals zero so that
06:23 - they know that the enemy has died so
06:27 - let's go ahead and run this and let's
06:29 - spawn another enemy so we got a villain
06:31 - we can spawn a zombie let's fight a
06:34 - dragon so we can click attack and in a
06:36 - second later
06:37 - is it taxed back and then we can keep
06:41 - fighting this dragon and then hopefully
06:47 - we will win and you see that says Popeye
06:52 - has one and it spawns a new enemy so go
06:57 - ahead put this code in if you have it
07:00 - it'll help you learn a lot faster if
07:02 - you're actually putting the code in and
07:04 - editing it yourself and then once you've
07:06 - done that go ahead and move on to the
07:08 - next tutorial
