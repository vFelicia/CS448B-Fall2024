00:01 - this is Alex from PHP academy.org and
00:03 - this video created for the New Boston is
00:05 - going to talk you through uh PHP while
00:09 - Loops now why do we use Loops in the
00:12 - first place as programmers now we may
00:15 - need to repeat a certain amount of
00:17 - actions a specified amount of times and
00:21 - um in a couple of these videos I'm going
00:22 - to be talking about uh while loops and
00:25 - then do while loops and then we're going
00:26 - to go on to for Loops as well so what do
00:30 - we mean by a loop a loop uh let me just
00:32 - show you the syntax first of all is for
00:35 - a while loop anyway is
00:37 - while um a certain condition is true so
00:41 - we're sort of you know if you if you
00:44 - understand if statements you should
00:45 - really understand this we're saying
00:47 - while something is
00:49 - true do something in here so for example
00:53 - at the moment I'm going to say Echo
00:56 - hello and I'm going to break down a line
00:59 - so while a certain condition is true now
01:01 - if I was to just pop a one in here it
01:03 - would be a pretty bad idea because one
01:05 - is always going to be true as we've
01:07 - discussed in previous videos zero is
01:09 - always going to be false so we can run
01:11 - this one if we uh refresh uh that's fine
01:13 - nothing's happened the page hasn't
01:15 - crashed however if we do while equals
01:18 - while one this is always going to equal
01:20 - true so we're probably going to crash
01:21 - the page in writing hello over and over
01:24 - again um basically until Infinity so
01:27 - it's an Infinity amount of times or
01:30 - infinite amount of times rather however
01:32 - if we um create a statement um in here
01:37 - that allows some point for to evaluate
01:39 - to false but while we want it to
01:41 - evaluates to true we can sensibly Echo
01:44 - this an amount of times so let's say I
01:47 - want to Echo hello uh 10 times I can
01:51 - create a counter up here and I'm going
01:53 - to start that at
01:55 - one now what I want to do is I want this
01:59 - Loop to echo or I want this Loop to
02:02 - execute so run this block of code until
02:05 - 1 equals uh 10 so we're e echoing
02:10 - once um twice three four five all the
02:14 - way up to 10 times and then once this
02:17 - counter equals 10 we stop the loop
02:21 - therefore breaking this uh this um block
02:24 - of code here and we continue to the rest
02:27 - of our code down here so if this doesn't
02:30 - make sense uh follow along my example
02:32 - and hopefully it will do soon so we'll
02:35 - get rid of the um the uh condition first
02:38 - of all and what I want to do is I want
02:40 - to say counter Plus+ remember this is
02:44 - incrementing this value each time so now
02:46 - we for the first time probably uh you
02:49 - may have found a use for incrementing
02:52 - obviously we can do
02:54 - counter equals counter + one but for
02:59 - shorthand counter Plus+ now the
03:01 - condition will be when counter is uh or
03:04 - while counter is is smaller than or
03:07 - equal to 10 so what we want to do is say
03:10 - while counter is smaller than or equal
03:14 - to 10 okay and this is basically saying
03:17 - if counter equals one run the loop Now
03:20 - counter is going to equal two on this
03:22 - line so counter will then equal two and
03:25 - then we'll run this again it's still
03:28 - smaller than 10 so say hello and now
03:31 - counter equals three so three this still
03:34 - is blah blah blah all the way up to nine
03:37 - now 9 is still smaller than
03:40 - 10 we Echo hello we increment the
03:44 - counter it's 10 Now counter equals 10 so
03:48 - we run this this will equal 11 so 11 now
03:52 - this condition is now rendered false
03:54 - it's it evaluates to false so we're not
03:57 - going to execute this code in here so
03:59 - hope hopefully that is a way of making
04:01 - sense to it for you I'm going to reset
04:03 - this counter back to one and we're going
04:04 - to refresh the page and see what
04:06 - happens so now you can see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
04:12 - 8 9 10 times we've echoed hello and to
04:16 - prove this uh sort of counter method
04:19 - inside I'm going to
04:22 - append the variable counter onto the
04:25 - start of this hello so this will
04:28 - actually say one hello and then it will
04:30 - say two hello and it will say three
04:32 - because we're incre incrementing this
04:34 - value each time so it's basic logic so
04:36 - let's refresh the page and see how
04:38 - that's worked there we are so we've got
04:40 - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 all the way up to 10 and
04:45 - you can now see just by that example
04:48 - that we're incrementing the value um so
04:51 - the wall Loop will always have a
04:52 - condition at the start of it that will
04:54 - need to be evaluated before we even
04:56 - begin to process the
04:58 - block
