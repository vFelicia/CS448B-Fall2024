00:00 - okay so today we're going to learn how
00:03 - to use factoring to solve GM geometry
00:07 - problems so a square had nine
00:11 - centimeters added added to its length
00:13 - and 3 centimeters added to its with its
00:16 - new area is 280 centimeters squared find
00:20 - its original length and width so first
00:25 - we had a square that had a length and
00:28 - width and now we have a new square whose
00:35 - length is l + 9 + W plus three birds
00:41 - with so we know that this new area is
00:47 - 280 centimeters squared so to find area
00:51 - we multiply the length times the width
00:58 - to get to 80 and since it's a square
01:06 - that means that this lengthen with are
01:09 - equal so we're going to represent this
01:11 - with an X here and not an L and then X
01:16 - here instead of a w so this is X plus 9
01:19 - and this is X plus 3 so when we rewrite
01:22 - the area we get X plus 9 plus X plus 3
01:26 - equals 280 now we have to foil this out
01:30 - in order to set this equation equal to 0
01:33 - so x squared plus 3x plus 9x plus 27
01:41 - equals 280 we're going to combine like
01:45 - terms and bring this to 80 over so you
01:48 - get x squared plus 12x minus 2 53 equals
01:56 - 0 now
02:00 - when we factor this if you divide 253 by
02:11 - different numbers you'll get that 2 53 /
02:17 - 2 23 is 11 and 23 minus a negative 11
02:25 - gives us 12 so that's so we know that a
02:28 - positive 23 and a negative 11 are going
02:32 - to go there so now we set each one of
02:36 - these equal to zero if you subtract over
02:40 - you get x equals negative 23 and if you
02:43 - add this ever get x equals 11 since
02:46 - we're talking about distance we can kick
02:48 - out this answer because distance can't
02:50 - be negative so we find that X is equal
02:53 - to 11 but they wanted to know what the
02:57 - original length and width was so that
03:01 - means that its original length is 11 and
03:05 - its original width is 11 let's do
03:12 - another example the length of a
03:15 - rectangle is 5 meters greater than twice
03:19 - its width
03:29 - and it's area is equal to 33 meters
03:32 - squared find the rectangles length and
03:35 - width so the length of a rectangle is 5
03:40 - meters greater so 5 plus twice its width
03:47 - so 5 plus 2w so its width is going to be
03:56 - equal to just plain w so its area is
04:05 - equal to 33 meters squared so that means
04:08 - that its length times its width is equal
04:13 - to 33 if we distribute this w we at 5w
04:18 - plus 2w squared equals thirty-three now
04:26 - we're going to set this equation equal
04:28 - to zero and i'm going to rewrite this in
04:31 - decreasing order so then we're going to
04:36 - have to factor this so this is going to
04:38 - be 2w this is going to be w so the
04:43 - factors of negative 33 r 3 and 11 now
04:50 - since we have a two in front of this w
04:52 - when I these two numbers is going to get
04:54 - x 2 in order to make these to add to get
04:59 - five this has to be a positive 11 and
05:04 - this has to be a negative 3 and then if
05:08 - you foil this back up you'd get 2w
05:11 - squared minus 6 w + 11 w minus 33 and 11
05:18 - w minus 6 w would give us five so then
05:23 - we can set both of these equal to 0 2w
05:27 - plus 11 equals 0 w minus 3 equals 0 so
05:32 - add 3 over and we get W equals 3 with
05:36 - this we'd get
05:37 - w equals negative 11 halves but since
05:40 - we're talking about length can't be the
05:42 - answer so it wants us to find its length
05:45 - in the width so its width is right here
05:48 - w but its length is equal to 5 plus 2
05:52 - times W which is three so it's like this
05:56 - equal to 11 that's all we're going to do
06:01 - with factoring in order to solve
06:05 - geometry problems make sure you come
06:07 - back and check out our next lesson where
06:11 - we're going to talk about dividing
06:12 - monomials
