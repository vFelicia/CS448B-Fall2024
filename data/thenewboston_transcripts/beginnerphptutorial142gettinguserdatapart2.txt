00:01 - so what we've done is we've selected
00:02 - just the field that we want from the
00:05 - users table where the ID is equal to the
00:08 - user ID that's logged in then we're
00:10 - running the query and checking if that
00:12 - works and if that does Works we're work
00:15 - sorry we're returning the result and the
00:18 - result takes in the query that we've run
00:21 - we're guessing the first row remember it
00:22 - starts at zero even though our ID starts
00:25 - at one that's just a superficial value
00:27 - it doesn't mean anything it's just a
00:29 - data that's stored but in actual fact
00:31 - we're returning row zero and that's and
00:33 - we're grabbing the field name field that
00:35 - we specified okay so um let's um in fact
00:42 - we can improve this still but I'll do
00:43 - that in a minute I'll show you that it
00:44 - works first we could uh even enclose
00:47 - this in an if statement and return if
00:50 - it's not worked we can return um the
00:53 - value not found um so let's do that I
00:56 - guess we can do that now so if
01:00 - that so if this returns a value we
01:04 - execute something in here now we need to
01:06 - assign a variable to this so I can say
01:09 - query result is equal to that if it does
01:13 - work return query result so we're
01:18 - constructing our um query we're running
01:22 - the query if the query is running we or
01:24 - has run successfully without error we
01:27 - are executing this block in here
01:30 - we're then in an if statement setting a
01:33 - variable called query result to this if
01:36 - this query or if this function rather
01:38 - works we then return the value we've
01:40 - just set here uh using these that I've
01:43 - already explained so let's give it a go
01:45 - let's um say we'll just do it down here
01:50 - for now so I'm going to
01:53 - Echo get user field and I want to get
01:58 - first name so we applying now the field
02:01 - name that we want to get remember the
02:03 - field name first name will be equal to
02:06 - Alex in this case because we're
02:08 - selecting from where the ID is
02:11 - one okay so let's test to see if this
02:13 - works and then we can apply it to this
02:14 - use you've logged in sentence let's go
02:17 - back to our page and refresh hopefully
02:19 - that works yeah that's worked so we've
02:22 - got Alex being
02:23 - returned so now let's enter a field name
02:26 - that doesn't exist I don't exist
02:31 - and let's
02:32 - refresh now we've not returned anything
02:37 - um um that's because um
02:41 - this that's because this has returned as
02:43 - false if we just had this on it own we'd
02:46 - have a nasty SQL error in the middle of
02:48 - something so if we can't find a field we
02:51 - just don't display it rather than
02:53 - causing a big error inside our program
02:56 - so let's go back to where we are we to
02:58 - index.php
03:00 - what we can now do is if logged in we
03:02 - can say first name is equal to get user
03:07 - field first name oh
03:12 - no first name then we can say surname is
03:17 - equal to get user
03:21 - field
03:23 - surname and then we can incorporate
03:26 - these inside of this sentence so you're
03:27 - logged in
03:30 - first name surname oh remember we're
03:33 - using single quotation mark so we need
03:35 - to escape that
03:38 - for uh first name and then we do a space
03:43 - and we can escape that again and say
03:46 - surname so you're logged in escape this
03:50 - string um concatenate on the first name
03:53 - and then we do us another space concate
03:55 - on the surname and then we continue the
03:57 - string so now we can see that on
04:01 - index.php it's taking the information
04:04 - relevant to
04:05 - us so uh let's just put a full stop
04:07 - after
04:09 - that and refresh so it looks a bit
04:11 - better okay so you're looked in Alex
04:13 - Garett now let's try it when we log out
04:14 - and log in as
04:20 - Billy okay so you can see that it's now
04:23 - taking the data relevant to the user
04:24 - that's currently logged in and it's
04:26 - displaying it back to us so now we can
04:28 - supply any field we we want any field
04:30 - name we want inside here and it will
04:32 - display it back to the user so when you
04:35 - eventually uh use um these examples for
04:39 - yourself when you're learning and you
04:41 - want to create the registration form
04:43 - which we're going to do in the next
04:44 - stage um you can add as many fields as
04:48 - you want to your database and then you
04:50 - can just use this function that we've
04:52 - created inside here which will be
04:54 - available at any page that you want it
04:56 - to be um by just requiring it up here uh
05:01 - you can just use this function to select
05:02 - any field so if we now even go and add a
05:05 - field to this so we added say telephone
05:07 - number we can then just respecify that
05:10 - inside
05:11 - um using this function so that's
05:15 - basically how we are grabbing data about
05:17 - the user and displaying it onto our page
