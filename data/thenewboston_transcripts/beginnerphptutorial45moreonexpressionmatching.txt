00:00 - and this is we're basically using
00:01 - pattern matching to ensure that it
00:03 - adheres to a certain standard so we can
00:05 - use PR rag match for the P rag match for
00:09 - this is a very very very powerful
00:11 - function like I said I'm not going to go
00:13 - through how we're going to check the
00:15 - patterns if you go over to the php.net
00:17 - manual you'll find plenty of information
00:20 - on how to match specific things whether
00:24 - it be URL so we could take out a
00:27 - hostname from a URL but basically we're
00:31 - basically looking for patterns within
00:32 - strings and doing things with that and
00:36 - there's a variety of ways you can do
00:37 - this returned as an array etc etc so
00:41 - what just for now that's basically the P
00:43 - red-red P reg match function let's go
00:47 - ahead and make this a bit more
00:49 - interesting we're going to feed in a
00:51 - string to a function and check if it's
00:54 - got spaces so let's go ahead and create
00:59 - our function and if you haven't already
01:02 - looked at functions don't worry follow
01:04 - it along the example anyway and if you
01:06 - want to go back and look at functions
01:07 - and how they work feel free to do so and
01:10 - come back to the tutorial if you don't
01:11 - understand what's going on so I'm going
01:13 - to create a function called has space
01:19 - and what we're going to do is we're
01:21 - going to return true if this if the
01:25 - specific string has a space and we're
01:28 - going to return false if it doesn't so
01:30 - we're going to feed in the string as an
01:32 - argument up here so now what we're going
01:34 - to do is we're going to say if and we're
01:36 - going to use the pewag match function
01:38 - again to see if we have likely defined
01:43 - before a space inside a specific string
01:47 - now the string comes from the argument
01:49 - that we've just fed in so if this does
01:51 - match then we can return a value of true
01:54 - so we can return true here
01:58 - otherwise we can return false okay so
02:06 - now what we want to do is we want to
02:08 - call this function down here but we want
02:10 - to cool it inside an if statement
02:12 - because we've got our function but as
02:14 - far as it goes at the moment when we
02:16 - refresh we don't have anything we
02:18 - haven't called it so let's create an if
02:20 - statement and say if has space and let's
02:25 - feed in some text so this doesn't have a
02:29 - space if this has space echo has a space
02:39 - else
02:42 - has no spaces
02:45 - okay so ore has at least one space now
02:53 - let's take this string out because I've
02:55 - just thought we it would better defined
02:57 - inside variable here and then we can
03:00 - just feed this variable in through there
03:03 - so let's recap of what we've done we've
03:06 - created a string here
03:08 - cool this doesn't have a space or with a
03:10 - value this doesn't have a space with
03:12 - absolutely no spaces in it and then
03:14 - we're calling our function here and
03:15 - feeding in this argument which is
03:17 - essentially equal to this string here
03:19 - and that's been processed here we're
03:21 - checking on the pre mag a PRP reg match
03:24 - which we've already looked at in the
03:26 - last part in the first part of the
03:28 - tutorial and then if this function
03:30 - returns true which it will if it does
03:32 - have a space then we're going to say a
03:34 - have at least one space or has at least
03:36 - one space otherwise we're going to
03:38 - return false and we're going to say it
03:39 - has no spaces so let's double check and
03:42 - see if this works okay so it says now
03:45 - has no spaces because this string
03:47 - doesn't in fact have any spaces let's
03:49 - just create one space in it and see what
03:51 - happens okay so it now says has at least
03:55 - one space now if we just create all the
03:57 - spaces in it we need let's just put a
04:01 - single quotation mark there and remember
04:04 - to escape single quotation marks when
04:06 - you're using single quotation marks
04:08 - outside of your string data let's
04:12 - refresh and it still says has at least
04:13 - one space so that's a brief overview if
04:16 - you like of the P reg match function and
04:19 - we've created our own little application
04:21 - here to check if a string data has a
04:25 - space or not and but do feel free to go
04:28 - and look up the P welcome P reg match
04:33 - pattern checking and it's very very very
04:36 - in-depth but once you do get your head
04:39 - around it you'll be able to look it and
04:41 - realize actually how useful it is for
04:43 - checking patterns within strings
