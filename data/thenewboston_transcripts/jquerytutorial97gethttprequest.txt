00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog
00:02 - with a video tutorial for the New Boston
00:05 - okay so in this tutorial we're going to
00:08 - take a look at jQuery get HTTP requests
00:12 - now this sounds a bit complicated but
00:15 - essentially all it does is all we're
00:18 - doing here is we are passing a value to
00:21 - a PHP file or another script file and
00:24 - then we're taking the contents and then
00:26 - showing it to the user so what we're
00:29 - doing is were performing in essence an
00:31 - ajax request or an ajax type request
00:35 - without having to refresh the page so
00:38 - this is generally what jquery is used in
00:42 - with a great deal for because it creates
00:45 - an really easy way to perform ajax like
00:48 - operations on a page so i'm going to
00:51 - give you a slight idea of what we're
00:53 - going to be creating we're going to be
00:54 - creating a form in which we in which we
00:59 - enter say a name or a piece of text
01:03 - we're then going to click the you know
01:07 - like a submit button and this value is
01:10 - going to be reversed so we're going to
01:11 - reverse a string we're just going to be
01:13 - using a simple function inside PHP to
01:16 - reverse a string when then going to
01:18 - return this data to the user but without
01:21 - having to refresh the page so usually in
01:24 - PHP you would think about if you were to
01:26 - think about this you would perhaps
01:28 - create a form you would create say form
01:33 - action equals and you'd create a file
01:36 - called something like reverse PHP you'd
01:39 - send the method as say get and you would
01:42 - then go ahead and inside the form create
01:45 - an input type with say text and you
01:51 - would give that a name and you'd call
01:54 - this string and you'd then create a
01:57 - button or a submit button
02:00 - and you'd give that a value so go for
02:04 - example so what this would do is it
02:06 - would take this value here and it would
02:09 - use it would use get so it would store
02:12 - it in a get variable which PHP can then
02:14 - pick up in this reverse dot PHP file now
02:18 - instead of actually submitting the form
02:20 - we use jQuery to submit the data for us
02:23 - and we specify which file we want to
02:25 - submit it to so if you're comfortable
02:29 - with jQuery even if you just started
02:31 - learning out you should be comfortable
02:33 - with taking the value of this text area
02:35 - so let's go ahead and refresh you should
02:39 - be comfortable with when we click this
02:41 - go button it will tell you should be
02:43 - comfortable with storing the value of
02:45 - this text area this text field now when
02:49 - we store the value of text field we can
02:51 - then pass it to a PHP file and return
02:54 - the result in a div just underneath so
02:58 - let's go ahead and get rid of this form
03:00 - because it's not required in this case
03:02 - we're using Ajax to handle our events so
03:06 - we're handling the clicking of this
03:09 - button we can also change this to a type
03:11 - button so we have exactly the same form
03:14 - when we refresh but all we've done is
03:18 - we've just got rid of the form outline
03:21 - of where we send the send the data to so
03:25 - now what we need to do is we need to go
03:27 - over to our ajax JS file and take a look
03:30 - at how we sort of create this event when
03:34 - we click click the button and then also
03:36 - getting the value of this string so we
03:40 - know the name of this is string and we
03:41 - know the name of this button is nothing
03:44 - at the moment so I'm going to give it an
03:45 - ID of so button and let me just get rid
03:51 - of name here and give this an ID of
03:56 - string so we're looking out for the
03:59 - pressing of the button which is called
04:01 - button and then we're getting the value
04:03 - of the string which is called string so
04:06 - let's go into your Ajax j/s and create
04:09 - our event handler
04:12 - okay so we are choosing to take this
04:16 - button and we're going to append an
04:17 - event on the end of it so button click
04:20 - so when this button has been clicked we
04:24 - create a function inside of this and
04:28 - then once we've done that we need to
04:30 - look at getting the value of this text
04:32 - area or this text field so I'm going to
04:34 - create a new variable and that's going
04:37 - to be called string and that's going to
04:41 - be equal to again we're going to use the
04:44 - hash selector to select the ID so the ID
04:47 - for this input field is string so we've
04:51 - used that selector and now we want to
04:54 - say dot Val so we're taking the value of
04:56 - this string text field and applying it
05:00 - or putting it into this variable in
05:02 - JavaScript called string okay so now
05:06 - what we can do is we can go ahead and
05:07 - just alert this out to test that it has
05:10 - worked properly so let's go over to the
05:12 - browser I'm going to go ahead and type
05:15 - in my name and I'm going to click go
05:17 - you'll see that we've got the value Alex
05:20 - that's been returned which matches
05:22 - what's in here so we now know that the
05:24 - value string holds the field contents
05:28 - essentially okay so now onto the
05:31 - interesting part we're going to use the
05:33 - get HTTP request to send this string to
05:37 - a particular file now we haven't created
05:39 - a PHP file yet we need to create that
05:42 - and then we can specify where we want to
05:44 - send it so I'm going to go ahead and
05:46 - create a new file I'm going to create a
05:49 - new folder and call this PHP and I'm
05:52 - going to save this file inside this
05:54 - directory and I'm going to call this
05:56 - reverse PHP just so we know what the
05:59 - file does okay so now we've got reverse
06:02 - dot PHP we can leave that alone for a
06:04 - moment and we can start to work on our
06:06 - HTTP requests so we're going to use a
06:09 - dollar sign but we're not obviously
06:11 - using a selector but we're using dot get
06:14 - now we create brackets for this and
06:16 - inside of here we're typically giving
06:19 - this three parameters so I'll just
06:22 - create the parent parameter
06:24 - in fact no I'll talk about them as we go
06:27 - the first parameter is the page that you
06:29 - want to send a particular set of data to
06:32 - so in this case it's PHP forward slash
06:36 - reverse PHP the second parameter is the
06:41 - list of variables you want to send and
06:44 - these will be accessible by reversed PHP
06:47 - by using dollar underscore get and then
06:50 - the variable name here
