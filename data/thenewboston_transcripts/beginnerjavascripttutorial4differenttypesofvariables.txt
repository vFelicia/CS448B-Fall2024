00:00 - what is up everyone welcome back to your
00:02 - fourth JavaScript tutorial and in this
00:04 - tutorial I'm going to be talking to you
00:06 - guys about all the different types of
00:08 - variables that we can use when working
00:09 - with JavaScript so the first type I want
00:12 - to talk to you guys about is what I
00:14 - showed you guys before and that's just
00:16 - basic numbers so go ahead and let's make
00:18 - a variable I'm going to call my tuna
00:20 - because I love tuna why not and set it
00:22 - equal to your favorite number mine is 20
00:26 - and then go ahead and this is a
00:28 - statement so we need to end it with a
00:29 - semi colon and then on the next line
00:32 - let's go ahead and print this out so if
00:33 - you remember that the way that we print
00:35 - out things in JavaScript is
00:37 - document. write and then inside
00:40 - parentheses we go ahead and write the
00:42 - variable name which is tuna and then go
00:44 - ahead and press semicolon and now
00:46 - whenever we see it on our web page it
00:49 - prints out that variable so we can see
00:52 - already that you can set numbers equal
00:55 - to variables but what you didn't know is
00:57 - that you can also set numbers with
01:00 - decimal points equal to variables so go
01:02 - ahead and add a decimal point to your
01:04 - number save it and then go ahead and see
01:06 - what happens so aside with whole real
01:09 - numbers JavaScript can also work with
01:12 - decimals as well and if you're wondering
01:15 - this all right can JavaScript also work
01:17 - with negative numbers well let's go
01:19 - ahead and see go ahead and type A
01:21 - negative number in there and yes it's
01:24 - true my friends JavaScript can handle
01:26 - negative numbers perfectly so basically
01:29 - any number number that you would want to
01:31 - work with in computer programming
01:32 - JavaScript can handle so now that we
01:35 - cover numbers let's go to the next thing
01:38 - and that is text now text in JavaScript
01:41 - and in all computer programming
01:43 - languages is actually called strings uh
01:46 - why they named it that I don't know
01:48 - maybe it's because a string of letters
01:50 - put together who knows don't blame me
01:52 - blame whoever made JavaScript but
01:53 - anyways if you want to set a variable
01:56 - equal to a string of text go ahead and
01:58 - set it equal to quotation marks and then
02:02 - go ahead and type your text in here now
02:05 - go ahead and save this and see what
02:07 - happens it prints out whatever text was
02:10 - in there so again if you ever want to
02:13 - set a variable equal to you know a
02:16 - sentence or a word or just a little bit
02:18 - of text you need to add those double
02:20 - quotation
02:21 - marks and the reasoning behind that is
02:25 - if you set it equal to something like
02:28 - tuna equals text and you don't have the
02:30 - quotation marks JavaScript is going to
02:33 - think that you have a variable right
02:35 - here and you're trying to set equal to
02:36 - another variable called text so that is
02:39 - why you need your quotation marks to say
02:41 - no this isn't another variable it's
02:43 - actually a word or a sentence or
02:45 - something like that so once you do this
02:47 - it'll work fine basically don't forget
02:49 - to include the quotation marks so now a
02:54 - little problem pops up and that's what
02:56 - if you're you know want to have a
02:58 - variable and set it equal to you know a
03:01 - saying or something like John
03:05 - said boy do I love Bessie well whoa why
03:10 - is stuff turning blue and anyways let's
03:13 - go ahead and save this and see what we
03:14 - want it doesn't work at all and the
03:16 - reasoning behind this is because your
03:19 - entire string of texts needs to be in
03:21 - between quotation marks so it's gonna
03:24 - say all right you have tuna you have a
03:26 - quotation mark here you have your ending
03:28 - quotation mark here and this is what I'm
03:30 - going to set equal to but what the heck
03:33 - is all this stuff if you already gave me
03:34 - two quotation marks well actually
03:37 - JavaScript is not smart enough to know
03:39 - that this is a saying and that this is
03:41 - actually part of the variable so in
03:43 - order to tell JavaScript that all right
03:46 - these quotation marks here are supposed
03:48 - to be inside the variable itself we need
03:51 - to add something called an escape
03:52 - character now what an escape character
03:55 - does is it takes the next character and
03:58 - it pretty much treats it as is a regular
04:00 - piece of text so this and this are
04:03 - Escape characters now JavaScript knows
04:05 - that this and this are the two quotation
04:09 - marks and everything in between here is
04:12 - just going to be basically your variable
04:15 - so go ahead and save this and now we get
04:17 - our quotation marks to pop up John said
04:20 - boy do I love Bessie and he really does
04:23 - by the way bess's a cow not you know a
04:26 - regular cow like a dairy cow I'm not
04:28 - making fun of anyone here but anyways on
04:31 - with this tutorial so anyways if you
04:33 - ever need to escape something then that
04:36 - is the you know that's a symbol you use
04:39 - a backs slash so there are different
04:41 - things that we need to escape but I'll
04:43 - teach you guys those as we come across
04:45 - them now let's go ahead and delete all
04:48 - this and let me talk to you guys about
04:50 - two different types of variables so we
04:52 - already learned about numbers and we
04:53 - already learned about text AKA strings
04:57 - so there are two other types of
04:59 - variables go that I want to talk to you
05:00 - guys about and the first one is called
05:02 - booing or Boolean however you say it and
05:06 - that's the word
05:07 - true and the world and the world I keep
05:11 - saying world like the earth and the word
05:14 - false now I'm not going to go over
05:18 - Boolean right now but just remember that
05:20 - they have special meaning in JavaScript
05:22 - so that's why whenever you you know you
05:25 - might be looking at a program and it
05:27 - says true or false then that is how you
05:30 - make a Boolean but again don't even
05:33 - worry about it right now um I shouldn't
05:35 - have even said anything but now that I'm
05:37 - going to confuse it I might as well
05:39 - mention this the fourth type of variable
05:42 - is called null and whenever you set
05:44 - something equal to null it means that it
05:46 - has no value at all and this is
05:50 - different than zero it's completely
05:52 - different than zero or 0.0 null is
05:56 - pretty much like an empty variable and
05:58 - again just with true and false you'll be
06:00 - seeing what these do later on but for
06:03 - now I just wanted to cover all the
06:04 - different types of variables so I had to
06:07 - include it but anyways um I didn't mean
06:10 - to confuse you just remember that you
06:12 - can use numbers and if you use letters
06:15 - then go ahead and put them in between
06:16 - quotation marks so once you understand
06:19 - that we're ready to move on to the next
06:20 - tutorial so anyways thank you guys for
06:22 - watching uh don't forget to watch the
06:23 - next tutorial and I'll see you guys
06:25 - later
