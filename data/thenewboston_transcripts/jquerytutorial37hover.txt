00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:03 - with a video tutorial for the new Boston
00:05 - in this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - looking at the jquery hover event
00:10 - handler and we're going to be creating a
00:13 - basic menu in which when we hover over
00:16 - the items we get a description of what
00:19 - the link will take us to so you've
00:21 - probably seen this in a variety of
00:23 - websites and in fact it's an extremely
00:26 - effective way to show your user what
00:28 - they're about to see and it's a it's a
00:31 - nice looking effect and it's done very
00:33 - very simply with jQuery so the first
00:37 - thing we're going to do is go ahead and
00:38 - create a basic menu and I'm just going
00:42 - to put a few different options in here
00:44 - so the first one is going to be videos
00:47 - the hyperlinks hash for now obviously
00:50 - you can choose the hyperlink if you're
00:53 - applying this to a website I'm going to
00:55 - give an ID to this and that's going to
00:57 - be menu underscore videos I can then go
01:01 - ahead and copy and paste this and I'm
01:03 - just going to paste this F make three
01:06 - references of it I'm going to put a
01:09 - slash after each one so I'm going to
01:12 - change these values just so we can get a
01:14 - bit of variety and then change the IDs
01:18 - that are associated with them as well so
01:21 - as long as we've done this and and we
01:24 - have a menu that we want to show for
01:26 - example videos code and forum you can
01:29 - see at the moment nothing happens the
01:31 - links don't go anywhere and nothing
01:33 - happens when we hover over them so now
01:36 - what we want to do is create an area
01:37 - below and I'm going to do this inside of
01:39 - a div and that's just going to be the
01:42 - menu feedback so what's going to happen
01:45 - is when we roll over a menu item in our
01:48 - browser we'll have the menu feedback
01:50 - display a short description about that
01:53 - link so the first thing we need to do
01:55 - with regards to the jQuery code is
01:58 - create an external file where we write
02:00 - our code so I'm going to create a new
02:02 - file in my text editor and inside the
02:05 - J's folder I'm just going to call this
02:07 - hover Jas
02:09 - so in here we can start to begin to
02:12 - reference these menu items and display
02:15 - the appropriate message the first thing
02:18 - I want to do however is create a
02:20 - reference to this JavaScript file I've
02:24 - just created so the type is going to be
02:26 - JavaScript text forward slash JavaScript
02:28 - and the source is going to be Jas /ha
02:33 - ver ax so now that we've included the
02:36 - hover GS script into our page we can go
02:38 - ahead and start writing the code now
02:41 - because we're using an event handler we
02:43 - again need to reference the videos code
02:45 - and forum I'm taking this short and easy
02:48 - way of doing this just for the
02:49 - simplicity of this tutorial
02:51 - and I'm actually copying and pasting the
02:53 - code down inside hover J s however there
02:57 - are more appropriate ways to write out
03:00 - the code so let's go over to our hover J
03:03 - s far and start writing this out like I
03:06 - said there are better ways to do this
03:08 - but for the purpose of the tutorial
03:10 - we'll keep it short okay so we need to
03:13 - reference our menu items individually so
03:16 - the first one I'm going to reference is
03:18 - menu underscore videos remember we gave
03:21 - the menu videos or the link and ID of
03:24 - menu underscore videos we're now going
03:27 - to say dots hover and then create some
03:30 - parentheses and inside here we can
03:32 - create the function that runs when we
03:35 - hover over this menu item so let's go
03:38 - ahead and write function I'll block and
03:41 - we'll just bring this down a bit here
03:43 - okay so we can start writing our code in
03:45 - we need to reference the menu feedback
03:49 - div and then place them at text inside
03:52 - of this so we reference this again and
03:55 - using the same method menu feedback and
03:59 - then we say dot HTML and inside here we
04:02 - can write some text so with regards to
04:05 - the videos we can write something like
04:06 - free video tutorials now when we hover
04:11 - over this link the menu feedback will
04:17 - contain this value here so let's go
04:20 - ahead and refresh when we hover over
04:23 - four
04:23 - woman code nothing happens because we
04:25 - haven't created an event for this year
04:27 - however when we hover over videos you
04:30 - can see that we have the free video
04:32 - tutorials text appear when we come away
04:35 - from this
04:35 - it stays however we do have another
04:40 - event handler for that as well so we'll
04:43 - discuss that in another tutorial so now
04:46 - let's go ahead and look at the code and
04:48 - the forum now the short way to do it
04:51 - would be to copy and paste this down the
04:53 - page so for the purpose of this tutorial
04:55 - that's what I'm going to do so we have
04:58 - the mint the menu code and we also have
05:02 - menu forum and we can then just change
05:06 - these values so free high-quality code
05:10 - and a help forum so now that we've
05:17 - created an event for each of these menu
05:20 - items when we refresh our browser when
05:23 - we hover over each one it changes
05:25 - depending over the one that we've
05:27 - hovered so using the hover event handler
05:30 - we've created a description of links
05:33 - when we hover over them
