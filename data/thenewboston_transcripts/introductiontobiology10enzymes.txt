00:00 - welcome back everyone my name is Sarah
00:02 - sorry it's been a couple of days since I
00:04 - actually made a video I've been really
00:05 - busy with school got some food poisoning
00:08 - a couple of days ago stay away from the
00:11 - seafood that's all I'm saying but
00:13 - anyways I'm back now and in this video
00:16 - I'm going to be talking about enzymes
00:18 - and biochemical
00:21 - reactions cells are constantly engaged
00:23 - in chemical activity and the major
00:25 - difference between living things and
00:27 - non-living things is that living things
00:29 - carry out chemical activities on a
00:31 - continuous and controlled
00:33 - basis if this wasn't the case we would
00:36 - not be alive because most of the
00:38 - reactions that happen with within a cell
00:41 - are really freaking
00:44 - slow but living things have these things
00:47 - called enzymes and enzymes are
00:49 - biological catalysts a catalyst is a
00:53 - molecule that can change the rate of
00:55 - reaction but is not consumed in the
00:58 - process and catalysts do this by
01:01 - lowering what is called the energy of
01:03 - activation in chemical systems the
01:06 - amount of energy that is available to a
01:09 - reaction is called the free energy also
01:12 - known as Delta G which stands for Gibs
01:14 - free energy blah blah blah blah
01:17 - blah normally you have your reactants
01:20 - are going to be at higher energy than
01:22 - your products and things like to be at
01:26 - lower energy they like to have as little
01:27 - energy as possible
01:30 - so during a chemical reaction you're
01:33 - going to have your reactants they've got
01:35 - to cross this energy barrier called the
01:39 - energy of activation but once they cross
01:41 - this barrier they're going to be
01:43 - transformed into products and they're
01:45 - nice and happy normally the energy of
01:48 - activation without a catalyst is going
01:50 - to be pretty large you can see here but
01:54 - the energy of activation with a catalyst
01:56 - is much much smaller so so it's a lot
02:00 - easier for reactants to be converted
02:03 - into
02:05 - products enzymes are normally composed
02:08 - of one or more polypeptide chains this
02:11 - means they are normally proteins however
02:14 - there are some RNA molecules that act as
02:17 - Catalyst anyways the basic structure of
02:20 - an enzyme is you've got your binding
02:23 - site you've got your enzyme here You've
02:24 - Got The Binding site there and then you
02:27 - got the acis site what going to happen
02:30 - is you have your substrate which is your
02:33 - reactant substrate is going to come in
02:35 - and bind at the in The Binding site once
02:39 - the substrate binds the enzyme is going
02:42 - to change its configuration it's going
02:45 - to change its
02:47 - shape the substrate is then going to be
02:50 - pushed back into the active site where
02:53 - it is going to be changed into the
02:55 - product product is going to be released
02:58 - and then the enzyme changes back to its
03:01 - original shape the enzyme has not been
03:03 - changed at all some enzymes or some
03:08 - reactions require something that is
03:10 - called a
03:11 - co-enzyme these are also known as
03:13 - vitamins like vitamin A or vitamin D or
03:17 - something like that but that doesn't
03:20 - really matter I don't know why I
03:21 - mentioned it I'm sorry sometimes when I
03:24 - don't have enough caffeine I tend to get
03:26 - a little scatter brained anyways moving
03:28 - on to these specificity of enzymes there
03:32 - are a couple of different theories on
03:34 - the specificity of enzymes the first is
03:37 - the lock and key mod this means there's
03:40 - one enzyme one substrate it's exactly
03:43 - like a padlock and a key there's only
03:46 - one key that opens each
03:50 - padlock the induced fit Theory say that
03:54 - the active site allows for some change
03:56 - in shape to fit the substrate so say the
04:00 - substrate has a slightly different shape
04:04 - than what the enzyme is used to it's
04:06 - kind of like a lock pick you can always
04:09 - you know it takes a minute but you can
04:11 - you can pick a lock as long as you have
04:14 - something that looks kind of like the
04:16 - key that you're using and there are also
04:19 - a couple of things that affect the
04:21 - actual enzyme function there is
04:23 - temperature which is the rate at which
04:26 - molecules move kinetic energy it's
04:29 - measure of K kinetic energy pH is the
04:33 - concentration of hydrogen ions these two
04:37 - things when altered can disrupt the
04:39 - actual shape of the protein protein
04:41 - folding you got substrate analoges these
04:45 - are molecules that look really really
04:47 - really similar to the actual substrate
04:50 - but may have some different chemical
04:52 - properties they might bind too tightly
04:55 - to the active site and will be unable
04:59 - like the enzyme is actually unable to
05:01 - release this analog so the enzyme is
05:05 - enzyme is rendered useless and you also
05:08 - have these things called alisic
05:10 - affectors These are molecules that bind
05:13 - somewhere else on the enzyme and change
05:15 - the shape of the enzyme so you can see
05:19 - we have our enzyme here substrate here
05:21 - binding site you've also got this thing
05:23 - called the alisic site so you have this
05:26 - little alisic effector it can come in
05:29 - and bed to this aleric site and it's
05:32 - going to change the shape of the enzyme
05:34 - therefore the enzyme is not going to be
05:36 - able to bind this substrate the enzyme
05:40 - is not going to work temporarily
05:42 - whenever this alisic eector unbinds the
05:45 - enzyme comes back to its original shape
05:47 - and then it combind the
05:49 - substrate but that's all I have for
05:52 - enzymes
