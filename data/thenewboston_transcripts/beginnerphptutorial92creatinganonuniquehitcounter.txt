00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:03 - and this is another tutorial for the new
00:05 - Boston now in this tutorial we're going
00:08 - to be creating a non-unique hit counter
00:10 - and by a non-unique hit counter I mean
00:13 - that every time the page is refreshed or
00:15 - rather every time we call the count
00:18 - function because we're going to be
00:19 - dealing with a lot of functions in here
00:21 - we're going to update an a text file
00:25 - with a value and that value is an
00:29 - increment on to the value that was
00:31 - previously in the text file so we're
00:33 - going to start off by creating a text
00:35 - file with a value of 0 inside it so I'm
00:38 - going to save this and I'm going to call
00:40 - it count
00:41 - txt so we've got count dot txt with 0 in
00:44 - it eventually this will increment
00:46 - depending on how many times the page is
00:47 - refreshed but that's that obviously the
00:49 - basics of it now what we need to do in
00:51 - PHP is work out how we're going to do
00:54 - this now it's always a good idea to use
00:56 - include files in your website and the
00:59 - reason for this is you don't have to
01:00 - copy and paste the code over for every
01:03 - page that you want to count on so we're
01:06 - going to create another new file this is
01:08 - going to have PHP tags in it and this is
01:10 - going to be called count PHP now count
01:13 - dot PHP is going to contain the function
01:15 - we need to increment account so what
01:21 - we're going to do is we're going to
01:21 - start by creating a function and that's
01:24 - going to be called and we'll say hit
01:26 - underscore count so what do we need
01:31 - inside this function well first of all
01:33 - we need to access count.txt so I'm going
01:36 - to create a handle and this is going to
01:39 - be F open and that's going to be a count
01:42 - txt and we're opening to read in so we
01:46 - use an R to specify that we're reading
01:48 - in from this file now what we're going
01:50 - to do is we're going to incorporate the
01:54 - F read function into this so I'm going
01:56 - to say current
01:59 - equals F read so it sorts about freed so
02:04 - F read and that's handle
02:08 - now we need to specify the data that
02:13 - we're reading in the length of the data
02:14 - we're reading in so this could be for
02:17 - example to my have a two digit number so
02:20 - basically if I had say the word Alex or
02:22 - the name Alex inside a file we need to
02:25 - read four from the for the length of
02:28 - four so how are we going to go about
02:30 - reading what's that you know we'd only
02:32 - read too much and we don't read too
02:33 - little if you've already seen the file
02:35 - handling tutorials you'll know that we
02:37 - can use the file size function which we
02:42 - can put in here to read in a specific
02:47 - file size of a file so I'm going to
02:50 - create a new variable up here called
02:52 - file name and this is going to make it a
02:54 - lot easier to update everything
02:55 - dynamically so I'm going to change this
02:57 - and replace it with the variable I've
02:59 - just created so this is this lines now
03:01 - going to do exactly the same thing
03:03 - however with file name we need to
03:05 - specify something like count.txt inside
03:08 - it we don't specify the handle that
03:10 - we've actually opened so we can then
03:12 - specify file name now what we can do is
03:14 - echo out current and see what happens so
03:18 - we need to call this function so let's
03:20 - go into index dot PHP let's require in
03:23 - fact let's include because it's not
03:25 - really a required file we don't really
03:27 - want to kill the rest of the page if we
03:29 - can't count people's views for pages
03:31 - views so includes count.php okay so now
03:37 - we can call this function because we've
03:38 - included this file so I'm going to say
03:41 - hit count now at the moment obviously
03:43 - this isn't going to update the count ext
03:46 - file but hopefully we should now read
03:48 - right to the screen the value of zero
03:50 - let's double check that okay yes so
03:54 - we've got a value of zero now let's just
03:56 - double check that everything's actually
03:57 - working and we'll update this to a
03:59 - thousand so the function here a file
04:02 - size would have taken the size of this
04:04 - so it will include that all four
04:07 - characters that we have inside here so
04:10 - let's refresh yeah so it's working
04:12 - correctly
04:13 - so we've successfully read it and let's
04:16 - just change this back to zero we've
04:17 - successfully read in the current file
04:19 - size now what we need to do is every
04:22 - time this functions cold
04:23 - we need to increment it so current
04:26 - underscore Inc equals current plus one
04:34 - okay so what we're doing is we're
04:36 - creating a new variable current
04:38 - underscore Inc and this is basically
04:40 - stamp increment and that's equal to
04:43 - current plus one so now let's echo well
04:46 - we can do that up here just to save
04:48 - space echo current Inc to see what it
04:51 - says it says one even though at the
04:54 - moment count is equal to zero so we're
04:56 - incrementing the value so we can store
04:59 - that hit and we don't need to echo that
05:01 - out but now what we need to do is reopen
05:03 - the file we can actually close the file
05:07 - here so F close that so we need to
05:12 - specify the handle so what we've done
05:14 - here is we've closed the file down here
05:16 - we're going to reopen the file and we're
05:18 - going to write the new value and the new
05:21 - value is this so let's just double check
05:23 - that we've got no errors now I've added
05:25 - that F close in there let's refresh echo
05:30 - this out just to make sure it's working
05:33 - ok so we've still got the value of one
05:35 - so everything is working now now like I
05:37 - said before what we want to do is we
05:39 - want to open up the file again so we can
05:41 - more or less use the exact same code
05:43 - here and in a minute I'm going to show
05:45 - you how we can change this and we're
05:47 - going to create another function that
05:48 - allows us to read or open up the file
05:50 - name again so we're going to create less
05:53 - code and we're going to create a more
05:55 - sort of flowing application that uses
05:57 - less less sort of repetitive code if you
06:01 - like so we'll do that in a minute so I'm
06:03 - going to say handle equals F open and
06:07 - again we're opening file name now
06:10 - already you can see we're duplicating
06:11 - code so we don't really want to do this
06:13 - that's why in a minute we're going to
06:15 - create another function up here and I'm
06:16 - going to choose w-4 right we could
06:20 - append but we don't want to be want to
06:21 - rewrite the file so we're reopening this
06:24 - count txt file
06:26 - then what we want to do is we want to F
06:28 - right we're writing to handle and the
06:33 - data we're writing is the current but
06:37 - incremented so now after this we want to
06:42 - close the file again and this should
06:45 - have updated our file so it's updated
06:48 - with the original value plus one we've
06:51 - reopened the file but this time we're
06:53 - writing to it rather than reading to it
06:55 - writing to the file using this F write
06:57 - function and we write into this handle
07:00 - which is the open file here and we're
07:02 - inputting the current value but
07:04 - incremented by one which was obtained
07:06 - from here and then we've closed the file
07:08 - again so let's close count up txt and
07:13 - we'll return here we're recalling this
07:17 - function so now what should happen is it
07:19 - should automatically update one
07:22 - paramount column for F close oh yeah of
07:25 - course so we haven't closed current file
07:28 - so let's refresh okay so now let's try
07:32 - and open our count up txt and see what
07:37 - it says so it's got two because I've
07:38 - refreshed the page twice so now let's
07:40 - close it again and let's refresh again
07:43 - come back to context open up this file
07:47 - count.txt and it says three so now that
07:51 - we've couldn't successfully created our
07:53 - hit counter and then we know that it
07:54 - works obviously now you'll probably
07:56 - understand why it's not unique because
07:58 - every time we're refreshing the page
07:59 - we're not checking that it's the same
08:01 - user so okay like I've said before we've
08:05 - reused this code here which is handle a
08:10 - review we'll set a handle with the F
08:13 - open function and the same with the F
08:15 - right in actually fact looking at this
08:18 - code because we're doing two different
08:20 - things I mean we've got the file name
08:22 - here and then what we're doing is we're
08:24 - opening the handle we're actually
08:26 - retrieving data then we're closing we're
08:29 - performing this operation and then we're
08:31 - reopening another file and because we're
08:35 - doing different things inside each one
08:36 - probably not a good idea to put this as
08:38 - a function
08:39 - so I guess for now this would be
08:41 - acceptable to to write this like this
08:44 - we're not going to need to put another
08:46 - function in however because we've
08:48 - created this function this is a good
08:50 - idea because we've included this count
08:51 - file and we can specify this wherever we
08:54 - want so let's say we wanted to include
08:58 - this file but not count we can we can do
09:01 - that but if we include the file then we
09:04 - have the option to call this function
09:06 - which will hit count so if we don't call
09:09 - if we don't call the function and we
09:11 - refresh the page you can see that when
09:13 - we open the count txt file again it
09:17 - still remains at 3 so this is a non
09:20 - unique hit counter in PHP
