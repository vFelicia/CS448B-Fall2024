00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new boss Tim
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're gonna be
00:07 - looking more at ArrayList now if you
00:09 - remember in the previous tutorials we
00:11 - looked at remove add remove at and add
00:17 - range and now in this tutorial we're
00:20 - gonna be talking about trimming a
00:23 - rayless to a certain size so that it
00:27 - behaves more like an array and it is a
00:29 - little bit more efficient than an
00:30 - ArrayList we can set the capacity of the
00:35 - ArrayList and we can also use binary
00:38 - searches to search for a certain value
00:41 - in our ArrayList so let's go ahead and
00:45 - get started let's go ahead and set the
00:49 - capacity of our ArrayList now what we
00:52 - can do is down here we can type my let's
00:59 - do it under form one load so we'll come
01:02 - over here and now what we're gonna do is
01:05 - gonna type my ArrayList
01:08 - dot and you can see here as I've said
01:11 - before there's a whole bunch of stuff
01:13 - here you can I
01:14 - Charlie encourage you to look at this
01:16 - and see what you can do with some of
01:18 - these functions and subs and so what
01:23 - we're gonna do is we are going to set
01:25 - the capacity so my ArrayList dock
01:28 - capacity equals let's just set it to you
01:31 - we have 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 so
01:39 - let's just set the capacity equal to 12
01:44 - or let's do a lemon so now if we go
01:50 - ahead and run this let's type message
01:53 - box and then we will type my ArrayList
01:57 - dot and then we'll type count so what
02:04 - this is going to do is it's going to get
02:06 - the count of the items in the array list
02:08 - and it's gonna return that as an integer
02:10 - so we'll just go ahead and convert that
02:12 - to a string so if we go ahead and run
02:14 - this here's our program and if we click
02:17 - display array list we get 11 because we
02:20 - said that capacity to 11 now if we set
02:22 - the capacity to anything else so let's
02:24 - do 20 we go ahead and run this it's
02:28 - going to give us the count of 11 because
02:33 - it's not giving us the capacity of the
02:37 - ArrayList it's gonna go ahead and give
02:39 - us how many items are in it now we could
02:42 - go ahead and add nine more items to my
02:44 - ArrayList and then the capacity would be
02:46 - full and it wouldn't let you add any
02:49 - more items to this so let's just do my
02:53 - array list dot capacity so if we go
02:58 - ahead and run this it should give us the
03:00 - value of 20 so we get 20 right there
03:05 - because we set it to that and then it'll
03:07 - go and add all the stuff to that so what
03:11 - we can also do is what's called trimming
03:15 - the ArrayList to the size so let's say
03:18 - you have an ArrayList you don't know how
03:20 - many items people or your program is
03:22 - going to be adding to that array list
03:23 - and you want to let them add it to until
03:26 - let's say a certain point in time and
03:28 - then you want to make it to where they
03:30 - cannot add anymore what you can do is
03:32 - you can trim your ArrayList to the size
03:35 - of how many items are in there so once
03:38 - they're done adding items it'll go ahead
03:39 - and trim it to size so we set that
03:43 - capacity to 20 then we added 11 items to
03:45 - it so what we can do is type my array
03:49 - list dot trim to size so the capacity is
03:55 - 20 but when we trim it to size is going
03:58 - to take that down to 11 because there's
03:59 - only
04:00 - eleven items in there and if we print
04:02 - out the capacity you can see that we get
04:06 - 11 because we've trimmed it down to
04:09 - however many items are in there so
04:11 - that's some pretty simple stuff there
04:13 - and for the last thing that we're going
04:15 - to learn in this tutorial we're gonna
04:17 - learn about the binary search so we'll
04:21 - come up here and we will just declare a
04:24 - variable so private index as integer so
04:30 - now what we're gonna do is whenever they
04:33 - click the button button list items we're
04:36 - gonna get the index of a certain item in
04:38 - there using a binary search so let's say
04:41 - we don't know the index of an item and
04:42 - we want to get that so we'll just type
04:44 - index equals and now we're going to type
04:48 - the name of our ArrayList so my array
04:50 - list dot and then we're gonna call
04:52 - binary search and if you read the
04:56 - description of this it says search is a
04:57 - range of elements in the sorted system
05:00 - doc collections dot ArrayList for an
05:02 - element using the specified compare and
05:04 - something else there but anyway what you
05:07 - need to get from this is that inside the
05:09 - arguments you're searching for a value
05:10 - now this could be a string or a number
05:14 - or a data type an object and so we'll
05:19 - just go ahead and search for Sam so it's
05:25 - going to search for Sam and it's going
05:27 - to return the index to us so down here
05:30 - we'll just messagebox index and we'll
05:33 - convert that to a string so if we go
05:36 - ahead and run this click display array
05:39 - list looks like we're getting an error
05:42 - here failed to compare two elements in
05:45 - the array ok so I found our error here
05:49 - and what we were doing wrong you can see
05:51 - that we added Sam to our ArrayList but
05:55 - when we add range my array add all the
05:57 - items in my array you can see that Sam
05:59 - is already existent in that so I'll just
06:02 - go ahead remove this right here and then
06:05 - we will stop the debugging and we'll go
06:10 - ahead and run this again and we will
06:12 - click display ArrayList
06:13 - and it returns the index of seven so I'm
06:19 - go ahead and practice trimming ArrayList
06:23 - setting the capacity I'm doing binary
06:25 - searches and whatever else like I taught
06:28 - you in this tutorial and once you got
06:30 - that down go ahead and move on to the
06:32 - next tutorial and thanks for watching
