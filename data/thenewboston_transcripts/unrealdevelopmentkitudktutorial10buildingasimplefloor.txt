00:00 - all right guys welcome to your 10th udk
00:03 - tutorial and now that we know the basics
00:05 - of brushes we can go ahead and start
00:08 - putting our skills to use and build a
00:10 - very simple level so in this tutorial
00:12 - i'm only probably going to be creating a
00:14 - floor for our player or character to run
00:16 - around on but throughout these tutorials
00:19 - i'm going to be creating a full
00:21 - i don't actually don't know maybe a
00:23 - house maybe a map maybe some kind of
00:25 - building but anyways in this tutorial i
00:27 - just want to get a floor a foundation
00:29 - built and we're going to be testing it
00:31 - out so the very first thing we want to
00:33 - do is we want to change the size and
00:35 - shape of this red builder brush because
00:38 - well it's going to be a kind of weird
00:40 - looking floor if it's just a square so
00:41 - go ahead and right click this red
00:43 - builder brush and we bring up the
00:45 - options
00:46 - so x is pretty much how wide do you want
00:49 - it and i'm going to go ahead and change
00:51 - this to 10 24 again look at your grid
00:54 - and make sure whatever numbers you have
00:56 - are divisible by whatever grid size so
00:59 - i'm gonna make sure all my numbers are
01:00 - divisible by eight that way it snaps
01:02 - nicely to the grid whenever i'm trying
01:04 - to line things up so 10 24 is divisible
01:07 - by eight let's think of a length for it
01:09 - um
01:11 - 1280 whoa
01:13 - hey oh
01:14 - 1280 and
01:16 - for z z is the height of the floor now
01:18 - we really could give us something like
01:20 - two but we want to add some depth to it
01:22 - so give it something like 32 and now
01:24 - whenever we hit build we see the basic
01:26 - shape so that's a pretty good
01:29 - size i think
01:30 - good enough for now so now if you go
01:32 - ahead and we want to add mass go ahead
01:34 - and hit csg add and now you can see we
01:37 - have some mass on the floor pretty cool
01:40 - huh so actually believe it or not
01:42 - this is a very basic level we could play
01:45 - this if we wanted to so in order to test
01:48 - out your geometry
01:50 - actually let me do this first
01:52 - anytime you're making a map and you want
01:54 - to test it out go ahead and right-click
01:56 - anywhere on the map and hit play from
01:58 - here and whenever you do
02:01 - it's going to pretty much throw your
02:02 - character in your map and first of all
02:04 - you guys are probably saying this what
02:06 - the heck bucky how the heck did i make
02:09 - you know a radar and a gun and a
02:12 - character with ammo and health i mean i
02:14 - thought we just made a four i didn't
02:16 - think i was that good yeah well by
02:18 - default before you know start making any
02:20 - characters and you just want to test
02:22 - something out the udk automatically
02:24 - gives you a test character basically to
02:26 - run around now so don't think that we
02:28 - created this by accident we didn't
02:31 - so with that being said you're probably
02:32 - going to notice one thing first of all
02:35 - if we shoot we can see that our floor is
02:37 - indeed there
02:39 - but i mean the lighting doesn't really
02:41 - resemble what we were seeing right here
02:44 - and the reason behind that is because
02:46 - whenever we're working in the udk by
02:49 - default we get unlit mode and that's
02:51 - pretty much the designer's view it
02:53 - lights up everything with a consistent
02:55 - light but it isn't what the gamer would
02:58 - see the gamer would see this a lit mode
03:00 - just like that so as you can see
03:03 - whenever we enter lit mode or game mode
03:05 - everything kind of turns to black so in
03:08 - order
03:09 - to get
03:10 - in order to uh you know have the
03:12 - character play the level successfully we
03:15 - need to add a light to this
03:17 - map now i know i'm not going to cover
03:19 - lights in this tutorial but for now just
03:21 - follow along with me
03:23 - go ahead
03:24 - and
03:25 - hold down l on your keyboard and click
03:27 - with your left mouse and once you do you
03:30 - get a light on your map now go ahead and
03:32 - with your move tool aka the translation
03:34 - mode go ahead and pull that light up and
03:38 - as you can see it automatically switches
03:39 - to lit mode again lit mode is kind of
03:42 - what the character would see unlimp mode
03:44 - is what the designer sees it just makes
03:46 - it easier to work with but go ahead and
03:48 - switch to lit mode and as you can see
03:50 - this is what the character would see so
03:53 - now the character has a nice light
03:55 - however if we go ahead and hit right
03:57 - click play from here check it out
04:01 - we're getting a bunch of error messages
04:02 - that say lighting needs to be rebuilt
04:04 - and pass need to be rebuilt and it
04:06 - didn't light up our level the reason
04:08 - behind that is because just like any
04:10 - time you make an update you need to
04:12 - update geometry aka build geometry
04:14 - anytime you add new lights you need to
04:17 - build all so go ahead and hit build all
04:20 - and as you can see a bunch of little
04:22 - boxes are going to pop open and our
04:24 - lights are going to start to build it's
04:26 - basically going to put our level
04:27 - together for us and we have a bunch of
04:30 - these uh errors right now but don't
04:31 - worry about those right now and now that
04:33 - everything is built our light our
04:35 - geometry go ahead and right click it and
04:38 - hit play from here and now check it out
04:41 - how awesome is that by the way
04:43 - uh
04:44 - for for the unreal tournament if you
04:45 - never played the game how you move
04:46 - around is the wasd
04:49 - just like that how you can turn is with
04:51 - your mouse and how you can shoot is
04:53 - either clicking the left button
04:55 - or the right mouse button
04:57 - so check it out we have an awesome
04:59 - amazing level we can go ahead and you
05:01 - know
05:03 - shoot the ground i guess that might be
05:04 - kind of fun or if we hold the right
05:06 - mouse button we can go ahead
05:08 - and build a spaceship
05:12 - [Music]
05:13 - pretty cool huh so with that being said
05:16 - that's all i'm going to cover in this
05:17 - tutorial again
05:19 - the couple things i want to mention is
05:21 - in order to change the shape for your
05:22 - brush go ahead and right click it and
05:24 - you can choose the shape choose
05:25 - something big enough where we can work
05:27 - with later on if you want to copy my
05:29 - numbers they're 10 24 1280 and 32
05:33 - in order to add a light go ahead and
05:35 - hold l on your keyboard and hit left
05:38 - click with mouse again i know i didn't
05:39 - cover lights in this tutorial but i just
05:41 - want to give us the light so we can test
05:43 - out our map
05:44 - and aside from that make sure you hit
05:46 - build all and that's this little button
05:48 - up here and that's going to put
05:50 - everything together for you so that
05:52 - being said i'm going to go ahead and
05:53 - save my map go ahead and press file save
05:56 - as and i actually want to make a new
05:58 - folder so new
06:00 - folder and i'm just going to name this
06:01 - like uh
06:03 - youtube
06:05 - and then go ahead and save it as like
06:08 - uh
06:09 - damn
06:12 - uh
06:13 - gotta think of a good name
06:14 - this is obviously really stressful for
06:16 - me so i was named my bucky's map and by
06:19 - the way this dm make sure whatever you
06:22 - save your map is make sure it's dm minus
06:25 - because
06:26 - this means deathmatch mode and that's
06:28 - what gives you your character in your
06:30 - radar and allows you to test out the map
06:32 - a whole lot easier than if you didn't
06:34 - have it so go ahead and save it make
06:36 - sure before your map name you have the
06:37 - prefix dm and that's going to give you
06:39 - that character and gun
06:41 - so for now that's all i want to cover in
06:43 - this tutorial hopefully you have also
06:45 - created a very simple floor and now that
06:48 - you have we're ready to mount the next
06:50 - tutorial so thank you guys for watching
06:51 - don't forget to subscribe and i'll see
06:53 - you guys in the next video
