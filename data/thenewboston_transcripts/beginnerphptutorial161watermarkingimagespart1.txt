00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:03 - and this is a PHP video tutorial for the
00:05 - new Boston in this video tutorial we're
00:09 - going to be using Gd
00:10 - which is an image library based in PHP
00:15 - and we're going to be watermarking a
00:19 - specific image we're going to be loading
00:22 - in a watermark which we are going to use
00:25 - to place on an image we're going to then
00:27 - load in on in an image a slightly bigger
00:31 - photo based image and then we're gonna
00:33 - be watermarking it in the bottom right
00:35 - hand corner so you've probably seen
00:37 - watermarking before on various different
00:40 - websites if you were to upload an image
00:42 - it may watermark it if you haven't seen
00:46 - watermarking then i'm going to do a
00:47 - quick demonstration of the effect that
00:50 - we want to achieve by the end of this
00:51 - tutorial and then and then we're going
00:57 - to look at what we can look at each
00:58 - individual file then we're going to look
01:00 - at it as a whole so let's first of all
01:02 - look at the watermark that I'm going to
01:04 - be using it's a file it in this folder
01:07 - called logo dot PHP so I'm working with
01:09 - files all in the same folder and the
01:11 - logo is just here ok so it's just a
01:16 - standard logo and it's of type PNG now
01:22 - the image I'm going to be watermarking
01:25 - this logo onto is phone jpg so let's
01:28 - take a look at that you can see it's
01:31 - just literally an image of a phone what
01:34 - we want to achieve is we want to
01:36 - watermark the the image into this bottom
01:39 - right hand corner just here we're going
01:41 - to have a position of 10 from here 10
01:45 - pixels from here and 10 pixels from here
01:48 - I mean we're going to set the
01:50 - transparency of this of this watermark
01:53 - to 20% so we've got a value ranging from
01:56 - 1 to 100 obviously a percentage we're
01:58 - going to go for 20% so let's have a look
02:01 - at the index file which is calling this
02:04 - file called generate PHP here and it
02:08 - looks something like source equals phone
02:10 - jpg in fact I'll run it in generate dot
02:12 - PHP
02:13 - but we can also run it from the index
02:15 - top here to be far because we've created
02:17 - an image with this URL in so let's click
02:21 - on here now the image is both the images
02:24 - that I just showed you have now been
02:26 - combined to create this image and you
02:29 - can see that we've got the logo that I
02:31 - showed you a moment ago water marked
02:34 - onto here we've got a distance of 10
02:36 - pixels here and 10 pixels here and it
02:38 - has a transparency of 20% so we've also
02:44 - got this inside our index.php file and
02:48 - it just shows exactly the same thing but
02:51 - it shows it as an HTML image so we can
02:54 - sort of copy it paste it do what we want
02:56 - with it
02:56 - so the generate PHP file generates the
02:59 - image while index dot PHP displays it as
03:02 - an HTML element it displays it as an
03:05 - image ok so now that we've seen the
03:08 - example and what we can do with this
03:10 - let's have a look at starting to write
03:13 - this code ok so at the moment we don't
03:17 - have any code I've cleared this let me
03:20 - just go to the browser and refresh so we
03:22 - sort of start with a clean slate with
03:24 - this and we're going to be working on
03:26 - this generate PHP far and we're
03:29 - gradually going to be we're not going to
03:31 - move preview or anything but I'm going
03:33 - to explain very carefully each function
03:36 - that I'm using and the arguments that it
03:38 - takes and why we're doing it and we're
03:41 - going to be doing this in a way that we
03:42 - must supply with an image otherwise we
03:45 - don't combine our watermark and our
03:48 - image itself now the first thing we need
03:51 - to do which is really really important
03:52 - is to change the type of our our page so
03:57 - what we need to do is we need to change
03:59 - the the type of data that our page is
04:04 - displaying basically and we do this
04:06 - using the header function in PHP now
04:11 - what we do is we just simply in here
04:13 - type content type and then just a colon
04:17 - now if you use it in with file types you
04:20 - know that a JPEG is image forward slash
04:22 - JPEG so by calling this function here
04:25 - and
04:25 - applying it with this header data what
04:28 - we've done is we've changed the generate
04:30 - PHP file to an image remember before
04:33 - when we looked at generate dot PHP on
04:35 - its own it was just an image file itself
04:38 - when we previewed it from index dot PHP
04:40 - we created it as an HTML element so
04:44 - we'll be doing that later on once we've
04:45 - ressort of achieved the desired effect
04:48 - that we need okay so the next thing to
04:51 - do is taken a parameter we want to take
04:53 - in some information from the user and
04:56 - this is in get format so what we want to
04:58 - do is we want to first of all check if a
05:01 - get variable has been submitted and this
05:04 - is going to be equal to source if it has
05:06 - been submitted all of our code is going
05:08 - to go in here because we need to supply
05:10 - a source being our the picture of the
05:13 - phone that I showed earlier that's the
05:16 - sauce so I'm just going to put this into
05:18 - a new variable to make everything a lot
05:20 - simpler later on we don't want to having
05:22 - to be having to keep referencing this
05:24 - now we can just reference source itself
05:27 - so let's just echo that out to make sure
05:29 - that everything works and to make sure
05:30 - you guys understand why I'm doing it so
05:33 - let's refresh the page okay so I'm going
05:36 - to now say source equals phone JPEG I'm
05:39 - going to press ENTER and nope nothing
05:42 - happening okay sorry
05:44 - yeah because I've changed the header
05:46 - content type we're looking at an image
05:50 - so I've just commented that out so it
05:52 - can preview this as plain text so you
05:55 - can see that now we're taking in this
05:56 - parameter here this can also be you know
05:59 - like - you can do whatever you want you
06:01 - with it it's just going to be the
06:03 - location that our original JPEG file is
06:06 - apt so let's say uh Necco that and
06:10 - uncomment that okay so
06:14 - the next thing we need to do is load our
06:17 - watermark into the program so we can use
06:19 - it a bit later and we also need to get
06:21 - the height and width values of our
06:23 - watermark and the reason for this is we
06:26 - need it later in the image copy merge
06:28 - function what the image copy merge
06:30 - function is going to do is it's going to
06:32 - merge our watermark into our actual main
06:35 - image the one that we're specifying in
06:36 - source but before we position it
06:39 - correctly we need to work out how large
06:41 - it is before we put it in with the
06:44 - correct values and make sure it looks
06:45 - okay so the first thing we're going to
06:49 - do is create a variable called watermark
06:52 - now we're going to use a function called
06:53 - image create from PNG so let's just
06:56 - create that function so we've got image
07:00 - create from PNG and all we need to do
07:02 - inside of here is specify the file that
07:06 - we are importing if you like all
07:09 - creating from our PNG image and this is
07:11 - the watermark file so I've got this as
07:13 - logo up here PNG because it displays the
07:16 - PHP academy' logo
