00:00 - all right welcome back everybody and in
00:03 - this video what we're going to be doing
00:04 - is working on a ticket from hasu and
00:08 - it's related to the withdraw
00:10 - functionality uh basically he's saying
00:13 - that whenever I'll show you go ahead and
00:15 - show you
00:16 - so first let me go ahead and deposit
00:20 - uh we'll do ten thousand
00:23 - and all right so
00:27 - so I'm going to deposit ten thousand see
00:29 - if we continue
00:31 - refresh and then I can transfer to my
00:33 - main account okay
00:35 - so right now I have uh
00:38 - 999 coins now let's say I want to
00:42 - withdraw
00:43 - a thousand let's see what we can use in
00:46 - his okay so he says well withdrawn a
00:49 - thousand coins
00:51 - um basically whenever you submit this
00:53 - form you don't end up with a thousand
00:55 - coins because the transfer fee is one
00:58 - coin what you end up with in your final
01:01 - account
01:02 - and I'll just make another account real
01:05 - quick
01:07 - two zeros at the beginning
01:08 - so whenever you actually make this
01:10 - transfer what you end up with in your
01:12 - final account is 999 coins and he's
01:15 - saying that a better UI would just be to
01:18 - say whenever withdrawing a thousand
01:20 - coins
01:21 - uh you should actually receive a
01:24 - thousand so the UI can just say
01:27 - um maybe a fee of one in the total of a
01:31 - thousand one and that way whatever you
01:33 - type in to withdraw that's what you end
01:35 - up with in your final account and I
01:36 - thought that was just a good idea so
01:38 - that's what we're going to be working on
01:40 - so the way that I'm going to tackle this
01:43 - is I'm basically just going to make the
01:46 - UI for it and then get the logic working
01:50 - because I have a feeling
01:53 - we are going to need to make some
01:54 - updates yeah since these have a width of
01:57 - 260 but I want to make a little bit more
01:59 - responsive as well so anyways uh we'll
02:03 - do that right now
02:05 - so first of all let's actually go ahead
02:06 - and make a branch for this so we aren't
02:08 - working off a master and ticket number
02:11 - 69
02:13 - and I'll say hasu fee for the branch
02:18 - so I'm on the front end New Branch 69
02:22 - [Music]
02:23 - a sue fee branch
02:27 - okay now let's figure out where that is
02:30 - so it's in the exchange main area
02:34 - and she's in the wallets so wallets
02:37 - withdrawal section
02:41 - [Music]
02:45 - standardize this panel interesting
02:48 - also let me actually look at this to do
02:51 - real quick
02:53 - okay
02:54 - so I had a little to do in there to
02:57 - standardize this panel since you see
02:59 - like I have different sections here and
03:01 - each have this like a light gray outline
03:04 - with some padding and rounded Corners
03:06 - right now all this is like hard-coded in
03:09 - a bunch of these places but I'm actually
03:10 - thinking about just removing these
03:13 - sections since I don't think we actually
03:16 - need the lines I think just the visual
03:18 - space will be good to have the users
03:22 - different differentiate these different
03:23 - sections but for right now just leave
03:25 - that as a to do since it's uh kind of
03:28 - out of scope for this
03:30 - but let's see what we got going on here
03:32 - so for which wrong I got the amount the
03:35 - account number now here
03:37 - is where I want to put something like a
03:40 - fee
03:41 - and total
03:48 - and that would go right here
03:51 - all right so first of all
03:54 - where is this
03:58 - coming from okay the error message
04:05 - when there is no error message yeah it's
04:08 - still a little bit too spaced just
04:10 - getting my spacing off the bat
04:15 - yeah so margin modern 32 is just a bit
04:17 - but yeah we can work with that
04:22 - so another thing that I want to do and
04:25 - actually thought I had this already but
04:26 - apparently it was for another app
04:29 - is well let's just make
04:33 - okay so I'm gonna need a flex area
04:36 - because I want to have fee and then the
04:38 - fee on the right
04:40 - and then those are going to be space
04:42 - between
04:45 - you see my flexbox cheat sheet
04:50 - so those are going to be yeah space
04:53 - between
04:54 - so the name for this can be
04:58 - um
04:59 - key value row
05:06 - [Music]
05:09 - what kind of name for this be actually
05:12 - fee total
05:15 - um detail row
05:22 - let me say detail row
05:30 - so detail row
05:32 - is just going to be display Flex
05:36 - and then what was it
05:41 - justify content space between and
05:43 - justify a Content space between
05:49 - okay then I'll say let's say the label
05:52 - and the value
05:59 - and I'll just do something like font
06:01 - weight bold for now
06:06 - even though I want to standardize this
06:07 - with my actually I can do it right now
06:15 - so far away comes from fonts
06:18 - and let's try semi-ball
06:26 - all right so the label and then the
06:28 - value
06:30 - and maybe it'll be better if these were
06:32 - spans but
06:36 - uh let's just get it working right off
06:39 - the bat
06:41 - so in my detail row
06:44 - I have
06:51 - a label and this can be like fee
06:54 - and then I have a value
07:00 - and this will be one but we'll replace
07:02 - that in a second
07:04 - with our Global constant and then this
07:06 - can be the total
07:07 - and this will be something like a
07:10 - thousand and one
07:12 - so now let's see what we got okay this
07:15 - is why I wanted to restyle this
07:18 - couple of different things
07:22 - so first of all
07:25 - okay let's start with the easy so I'm
07:27 - going to change this from semi bold to
07:30 - bold
07:31 - and I'm also going to make a detail row
07:34 - container
07:38 - and have margin bottom
07:41 - 32 pixels
07:43 - and I'll stick this in there
07:55 - and another thing that I could do is
07:57 - just say get the last child of the
07:59 - detail row and then
08:01 - put a marching bottom 32 on that will
08:03 - save me an element but
08:06 - I think this is all right for now
08:10 - maybe not but we'll adjust this later
08:13 - okay now this entire thing
08:17 - it's in the form
08:21 - and I'm wondering if I do
08:24 - with two 360 pixels okay
08:30 - so let's do this let's style the form
08:34 - 260 pixels
08:38 - okay
08:44 - so import form
08:50 - and then what we're gonna do
08:56 - import form is unstyled form
08:58 - and then we're going to rename this the
09:00 - form and then we're going to say form is
09:03 - a styled version of our unstyled form
09:09 - and then what we'll say is a width of
09:12 - 260 pixels
09:15 - and since
09:17 - the detail rail container is within the
09:20 - form
09:21 - then it'll shrink to the same width as
09:23 - that now another thing that I want to do
09:26 - that isn't really going to matter right
09:27 - now
09:28 - but for these inputs they also have a
09:31 - width of 260 pixels and I want those
09:35 - even though they're the same width and
09:37 - everything looks all right now now I
09:39 - want to just give those explicit width
09:41 - of 100 and then I'm going to let the
09:42 - width of the form dictate pretty much
09:45 - the total width of everything
09:47 - so in that said
09:50 - I am going to import
09:54 - my inputs as you input
09:59 - just like this form EFG hi
10:02 - I'm going to say that input
10:06 - is a styled version of my input except
10:09 - it has a width 100 percent
10:12 - and then these
10:17 - puts can be replaced with my fancy
10:19 - schmancy styled inputs
10:23 - okay
10:25 - now that should be the same however now
10:29 - if I go to my form and I ever want to
10:32 - grow it oh yeah look at that if I ever
10:34 - want to grow it or Shrink it everything
10:36 - kind of sticks with it noise and neat
10:39 - okay
10:40 - so now that that is taken care of
10:44 - let's go ahead and just style this a bit
10:46 - more so what I want to do here
10:49 - is I want to add a space in between fee
10:51 - and total kind of just one of these
10:53 - lines right here
10:56 - I'm wondering if it's going to be easy
10:58 - just to literally stick a line element
11:00 - there and I think it might be
11:04 - and we have a line component I believe
11:06 - don't we yes line
11:09 - all right so first let's stick a line
11:10 - there and hopefully it's close to what
11:13 - we want
11:15 - although I'm already thinking
11:22 - all right actually not even gonna go to
11:25 - this step I'm gonna go right to styling
11:27 - it if it's your jkl
11:31 - because I know we're gonna have to add
11:32 - some Marty margin around it
11:45 - all right so line
11:47 - is going to go in between right here
11:57 - all right looking good so far now let's
12:01 - just get some margin around you so I'll
12:04 - say uh margin uh let's do four pixel
12:08 - zero
12:10 - how's that look not bad not great not
12:13 - bad though
12:15 - great
12:17 - not bad though
12:22 - and not bad I think is what we're
12:25 - looking for
12:27 - all right so we'll do actually maybe if
12:31 - we do this
12:33 - yeah I think that looks alright
12:39 - and maybe all this should be smaller too
12:41 - since look at the labels here
12:44 - so maybe font size 12 on the entire
12:46 - thing
12:48 - but let's get our changes done that we
12:51 - just did so this is going to have a
12:53 - margin uh four pixels top and bottom
12:56 - zero left and right
12:58 - and now this container
13:00 - is going to have a margin bottom 24. I
13:04 - thought that was a little too far away
13:05 - from the button
13:06 - and now let me just refresh this and see
13:08 - what we're working with
13:11 - okay so my form
13:13 - changes aren't picked up
13:18 - and why not
13:19 - form width 260.
13:24 - well that's interesting form oh
13:28 - because this isn't my style form
13:34 - there we go okay
13:37 - so now now
13:39 - all of this is looking at
13:43 - okay now I just want to go ahead and see
13:46 - if I can get the uh
13:49 - see if a better font size would look any
13:51 - better
13:52 - so this all by default is 14 however if
13:55 - I take this container and say oh 12
13:59 - that's a little bit too small
14:01 - 13 that is not looking terrible
14:10 - well let's just stick with the default
14:11 - of 14 okay
14:16 - all right
14:18 - now since this is looking not half bad
14:21 - what I can do from here
14:24 - is pretty much start building out this
14:27 - logic so first of all
14:28 - I'm gonna go
14:34 - and
14:37 - actually let me look and see if I have
14:39 - this
14:42 - when I withdraw
14:52 - yeah I don't know if I have this default
14:55 - fee anywhere
15:04 - interesting interesting interesting
15:07 - interesting transaction fee
15:14 - huh
15:15 - very interesting okay
15:18 - and now let me check out one of my other
15:19 - projects
15:23 - so
15:25 - protocol core transaction fee okay let
15:29 - me just copy this
15:31 - since yeah this is the fee for the back
15:32 - end I just thought I had a constant for
15:34 - it but apparently not so I'm just going
15:36 - to copy the standard from my other
15:38 - section so in Constance protocol core
15:42 - transaction fee is one
15:44 - so I'm going to say import
15:50 - Constance protocol
15:53 - core transaction fee and then I can use
15:55 - it in place of this hard-coded
15:57 - value for fee right here
16:00 - and also my validation okay
16:05 - so now what I can do is this
16:12 - further instead of
16:18 - so this value is going to be a string
16:20 - right
16:29 - okay
16:32 - and then this
16:41 - okay let's give this one the chat GPT
16:43 - okay
16:46 - instead of 1001
16:58 - with
17:00 - the
17:04 - uh how do I say this with uh the
17:12 - result of
17:17 - values
17:18 - amount Plus
17:23 - core transaction fee
17:32 - if there is no values dot amounts and I
17:36 - just want to make sure it's named
17:37 - correctly values dot amount
17:42 - then
17:45 - render a hyphen
17:52 - they say then display a
17:59 - just a slightly an empty string then we
18:02 - can change it
18:14 - here's how you can replace this with
18:17 - values amount plus transaction fee
18:24 - okay
18:26 - okay
18:38 - let's pretty sure this is all the same
18:41 - and then actually I'm wondering if we
18:43 - should
18:45 - yeah I'm thinking we should split it out
18:50 - to a function even if it gives us a
18:52 - non-function
18:54 - because we're gonna need to use this
19:02 - in the request that as well
19:10 - so this looks correct
19:13 - just thinking if we need to split it out
19:22 - okay
19:24 - so
19:25 - if the amount is one thousand
19:28 - and it is a 1001 and last but not least
19:32 - let me go ahead and
19:39 - hmm
19:47 - let me make a good total EFG
19:59 - all right so this is going to return
20:00 - actually
20:03 - yeah this can return
20:06 - a number
20:08 - and it is going to take an amount
20:15 - string which is a string
20:21 - and we'll say that you will return
20:23 - the amount string plus the core
20:26 - transaction fee
20:34 - say return number or no
20:41 - and I will say
20:51 - and maybe we can just use the string
20:53 - amount here however is that going to get
20:56 - confusing I don't think so
20:59 - then we can just say values dot amount
21:02 - okay so when getting the total
21:07 - if there's values that amount say get
21:10 - total
21:11 - values dot amount
21:14 - all right so this should result in the
21:16 - same logic also now what I can do
21:20 - is I can say
21:25 - to local string and that's going to put
21:27 - my commas in where I want
21:36 - object is possibly no
21:40 - interesting
21:43 - so do I want to do that
21:47 - don't think so
21:50 - so values dot amount
21:52 - so this is guaranteed that we have an
21:54 - amount
21:58 - all right so we'll say we'll call it on
22:01 - a number
22:06 - and it's going to return a number
22:12 - okay
22:16 - all right now even if you have a zero
22:21 - the greater than one one two
22:24 - space nothing okay QA session good
22:28 - so 12 total 13 beautiful beautiful okay
22:33 - so now what's the last thing that we
22:37 - need to do and that is
22:41 - actually get the updated amount here
22:47 - which is
22:52 - uh this amount
22:56 - to basically get total here
23:05 - and this is going to ensure that we have
23:08 - it through validation good good good and
23:11 - submit this okay
23:13 - so now this should all be good now once
23:15 - I withdraw
23:19 - a thousand it says fee of one total of a
23:23 - thousand and if I just send it to the
23:26 - same recipient
23:28 - let's see what happens all right so now
23:31 - I withdrew a thousand and it said indeed
23:34 - a thousand in the total even though it
23:37 - was a thousand one we were able to
23:38 - communicate that information and
23:41 - everything is looking I now okay
23:45 - so probably some styling updates that we
23:48 - can do but I think uh
23:51 - yeah I think this is good for now
23:54 - now before
23:56 - I'm wondering if we should ask chpt if
23:59 - there's any way to uh improve this
24:02 - is out of Mound if not anti-string yeah
24:04 - I think it's good
24:09 - all right got this my styles
24:13 - good enough for now got our two dude to
24:15 - take care of but sorry for another day
24:17 - okay
24:18 - so now let me just lint this and push it
24:21 - up so I can run lint
24:32 - yeah that looks good so let's say this
24:35 - is 69.
24:38 - feature of this
24:43 - push that up
24:46 - and on the front end
24:58 - this closes 69.
25:04 - just look at what we changed added a new
25:06 - constant
25:10 - our styling
25:16 - and all right I think we are good
25:19 - so now it's squash and merged it's bad
25:21 - boy in squash emerge squash merge and
25:24 - delete the branch and delete the branch
25:28 - pretty cool song huh yeah just made it
25:30 - up
25:31 - believe it or not
25:32 - all right
25:35 - now that is taken care of let me stop my
25:38 - server and let me pull down master
25:42 - and make sure everything is good go
25:46 - good to go
25:50 - pull those down I believe so okay
25:54 - so now actually let me get my phone in
25:56 - oh here it is
25:59 - so this should be good now by the way
26:01 - thank you sue for that
26:04 - this app is getting better and better
26:06 - each day and I wrote some things down
26:11 - initial State use effects add username
26:13 - wallet balances okay so an easy thing
26:16 - that we can do is add a username here
26:19 - actually let me start writing some of
26:20 - these down
26:22 - so passionation empty States uh let me
26:26 - add on this
26:29 - set defaults for UI I just had a little
26:33 - note here and what I'm talking about in
26:36 - this is that you see whenever you log in
26:38 - and you go to your wallets or something
26:41 - then even though you have a wallet sheet
26:43 - you still need to select one and then
26:45 - click the pause it before you see
26:47 - anything right here however I thought it
26:49 - would be a better kind of user
26:50 - experience is if this was like
26:52 - pre-selected
26:54 - however
26:55 - I think that the logic can be pretty
26:57 - easy just in this page
27:00 - how we can say components can set their
27:02 - own initial state with the use effect
27:04 - just basically say if I have wallets in
27:06 - here and there's nothing here then just
27:09 - set this in Redux
27:11 - so I end a little note for this
27:14 - I'll say uh
27:25 - using news effect update that
27:29 - basically just converting the notes that
27:31 - I had on my phone since I was uh
27:34 - not near a computer last night
27:37 - okay so another thing that I want to do
27:41 - is of course for this profile I realized
27:43 - that it doesn't even have the username
27:45 - right here my username is Bucky
27:47 - and also another thing that I want to do
27:51 - is I think I want to display the wallet
27:53 - balances right here which are just these
27:55 - balances on the user's profile
27:59 - so I'll say
28:06 - profile UI elements
28:13 - all right my phone keeps turning off
28:15 - when I'm trying to write this okay add
28:18 - username and wallet bound system profile
28:20 - add username and
28:22 - wallet balances to profile
28:25 - new ticket done
28:28 - um okay another thing is the ability to
28:30 - view other people's profile for example
28:32 - Bob is a user but I can't click this to
28:36 - see his profile so
28:40 - I'll say View
28:42 - others profiles
28:44 - no description needed boom roasted
28:46 - that's a ticket
28:47 - another one cup of ataxia social
28:52 - uh users okay
28:54 - so another thing is that users should be
28:57 - taken to their profile on login right
28:59 - now it's taken to the course page
29:00 - there's not really anything uh this one
29:04 - probably isn't going to change all that
29:06 - often and I don't know just want to make
29:07 - it a little bit more social rather than
29:09 - the feeling you come in and you look at
29:12 - chorus and it's like now up so
29:14 - let me check this off users should be
29:16 - taken to their profile on login
29:25 - to their profile on login
29:30 - boom roasted there you go
29:32 - uh let's see and I want to have a
29:35 - feature for private messaging as well
29:42 - but this
29:44 - is actually going to come after my
29:48 - social feature
29:50 - uh private messaging needed okay and she
29:53 - states default for UI pagination profile
29:56 - UI elements view others private
29:58 - messaging I wonder if I could label this
30:00 - as feature
30:04 - uh I don't have all my labels yet but
30:08 - otherwise let me just say social first
30:13 - and add a back end for this
30:16 - and this is probably going to be the
30:18 - next big feature
30:19 - that we're going to be working on
30:27 - okay
30:28 - social
30:29 - so basically I want to allow it where
30:33 - um yeah kind of like your uh what you
30:35 - would imagine social feature the ability
30:37 - to add posts
30:39 - with images optionally and then the
30:43 - ability for other people to comment on
30:45 - those
30:47 - and with that after we have that like
30:51 - core social feature then we could
30:53 - integrate these credits or coins
30:55 - probably for like tipping people
30:58 - or whenever you comment on their post or
31:01 - we'll figure out a way to integrate them
31:03 - but for right now I just want to get the
31:04 - basic functionality taken care of and
31:06 - then kind of worry about
31:08 - um
31:09 - I would say post MVP functionality
31:12 - but either way I yeah what I'll do is
31:16 - I'll just upload this video
31:19 - and
31:21 - oh let me think about what I'm doing
31:24 - next
31:26 - maybe I can get so I'm probably going to
31:29 - be working
31:30 - maybe I'll work on this social feature
31:32 - next because even though we have a lot
31:34 - of little things to take care of and you
31:37 - know I don't like uh having this it's
31:40 - not really detected I would say but um
31:42 - these little features kind of pile up
31:45 - what I also want to do is I want to
31:47 - build the social feature because that's
31:49 - going to start like allowing people to
31:50 - connect and getting value out of this
31:52 - app
31:53 - and before we make everything look
31:54 - pretty we need to make sure that we're
31:57 - getting giving value to the users we can
32:00 - actually do something and also it's
32:02 - going to help get feedback because they
32:04 - can like post if something's not working
32:05 - and it'll
32:07 - um really help us from there
32:09 - but uh either way I think that's good
32:12 - for this video so uh yeah probably gonna
32:15 - just grab a coffee and start recording
32:18 - the next one in just a few minutes but
32:19 - for now thanks for watching and I'll see
32:22 - you in just a little bit
