00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' door
00:02 - creating this video for the new Boston
00:04 - we've already looked in file uploading
00:06 - at how to actually upload the file then
00:10 - what we did is we went on to look at the
00:11 - security so we made sure that this file
00:13 - could only be jpg or with the jpg
00:17 - and we did that in two ways to ensure
00:19 - that we have the maximum security
00:21 - possible however what happens if we want
00:24 - to check the file size now file size is
00:27 - actually processed through in bytes so
00:29 - we can uncomment this now because we
00:30 - want to use this so let's just echo that
00:33 - out and then we'll comment how the rest
00:35 - of this code so we can preview the
00:39 - result of this so let's just go and
00:40 - choose a file we'll choose this image
00:42 - file again and click Submit now you'll
00:44 - see that this file has been returned at
00:46 - one hundred forty five thousand eight
00:49 - hundred and one bytes so we can
00:53 - automatically tell by looking at it with
00:55 - simple maths that this is one hundred
00:56 - and forty five kilobyte file nearly one
00:59 - hundred and forty six kilobytes so we
01:01 - can use this to allow ourselves to
01:04 - process files let's say we don't want to
01:08 - file over two megabytes we don't an
01:10 - image file over two megabytes so let's
01:14 - say we are going to stick without two
01:16 - megabyte maximum allowed file size now
01:20 - the way we do this is we can easily work
01:23 - this out using Google so if I just pull
01:25 - up this page here you can see I've
01:27 - already typed two megabytes two bytes
01:28 - Google's automatically use the
01:30 - calculator to work this out for me it's
01:32 - two million and then blah blah blah so
01:35 - if we just copy and paste this we can
01:40 - copy and paste this into a variable in
01:42 - our code so we can get rid of these
01:43 - comments now so I want as well as let's
01:49 - just get rid of this echo as well as
01:51 - well as extension up here I now want to
01:53 - create a variable undersized saying max
01:56 - size so I'm going to make this equal to
01:59 - this number obviously we want to pull in
02:02 - the spaces so we've got it as an integer
02:04 - so the max size is this so we need to
02:08 - now perform a simple check to see if the
02:10 - max size is less than or equal to
02:13 - sighs so what we're going to do is we
02:16 - are going to modify this here and we're
02:19 - going to create another answer using
02:21 - another logical operator here and and
02:23 - we're saying and size smaller than max
02:30 - size so now we need to modify our error
02:35 - message accordingly accordingly and must
02:38 - be two megabytes for or less okay so now
02:42 - what we're doing is well it's checking
02:43 - for the file extension we're also and
02:45 - then checking that the size is less than
02:47 - oh I forgot the equals two so less than
02:50 - or equals two Mac size so this is a this
02:54 - is basically going to work now so let's
02:57 - just double check I don't actually have
03:01 - a file available that's more than two
03:03 - megabytes at the moment so what I'm
03:04 - going to do is I'm going to slightly
03:06 - decrease this value and I'm going to say
03:09 - a hundred hundred kilobytes so the
03:14 - maximum is a hundred kilobytes which is
03:17 - ten thousand well it's not exactly
03:19 - because of the you know just how it
03:21 - works out but we could more accurately
03:26 - calculate that there so now I'm just
03:28 - going to say a hundred thousand bytes
03:30 - okay so let's open up our choose file
03:36 - now let's get rid of everything in our
03:40 - uploaded folder just so we like this
03:45 - we've got one file in there let's just
03:46 - get rid of that let's pop a star in
03:51 - there and we'll delete that one there
03:53 - okay so now what we're going to do is
03:56 - we're going to upload two files and
03:59 - because I've now set my limit to roughly
04:03 - 100 kilobytes because as far as more
04:05 - than 100 kilobytes it won't be uploaded
04:07 - it's 142 kilobytes so if I click on that
04:10 - and click Submit you can see that we're
04:12 - now getting the error message far must
04:14 - be jpg and must be 2 megabytes or less
04:16 - so you can modify your error message
04:18 - accordingly or you could do two
04:20 - different if statements and one to check
04:23 - the extension and give the appropriate
04:24 - message or you can do one and and you
04:26 - could do one to check
04:27 - and give the appropriate message there
04:30 - as well so now let's choose this let's
04:33 - choose this file dot PHP now this one at
04:37 - this point just to point out if I was to
04:40 - change this to file jpg and I was to try
04:44 - and upload this you can see at the
04:46 - moment it's being uploaded and the
04:48 - reason for this is we need to change our
04:52 - if statement slightly I've just realized
04:55 - from the last video that we need to make
04:56 - em an adjustment so we also need to say
04:59 - and type equals equals and we need to
05:05 - say image and we need to say jpg okay so
05:09 - now let's try and choose this fake JPEG
05:13 - file which is actually a PHP file and
05:15 - we'll click Submit and it's giving us
05:18 - the appropriate error message however
05:20 - let's just say I was too and if we have
05:25 - an image here that's under a hundred
05:27 - I'll there we go we've got one here
05:29 - that's fifty four point three kilobytes
05:31 - so let's try and upload that we click we
05:35 - click Submit and it hasn't worked so
05:37 - let's go back again and this is just my
05:39 - logic and we need to let's just first of
05:42 - all and close this in brackets so we can
05:44 - see what we're doing properly we need to
05:46 - say if type equals image JPEG or type
05:50 - equals image jpg so let's try again so
05:55 - as long as you can get your head around
05:56 - the logic of it which I'm obviously
05:57 - having a problem doing at the moment
05:59 - you'll be absolutely fine so let's try
06:02 - not blow this 54 kilobyte file and that
06:05 - says uploaded let's just try and upload
06:07 - the fake file and click Submit and that
06:10 - says uploaded okay so little part let's
06:14 - go back and just revise our code and
06:16 - first of all so image extension is jpg
06:21 - or jpg we also need to say and type
06:24 - equals and this should always be correct
06:28 - if the file type is a jpg file so let's
06:34 - just and then we check for the size so
06:37 - let's just go through this again
06:39 - so let's try and upload first of all
06:42 - just a normal file okay so the size is
06:45 - bigger than two megabyte so now let's
06:46 - try not flowed one that's under the size
06:49 - which is this one here click Submit okay
06:53 - so that's been uploaded now let's try
06:55 - and upload this file jpg this PHP file
06:58 - we've renamed and that still being
07:00 - uploaded okay so I think probably at
07:03 - this point if a user were to rename a
07:07 - PHP file to jpg there's nothing that
07:10 - they can actually do with it in terms of
07:14 - on the server it will still be uploaded
07:16 - as an image file unless they have access
07:19 - to the server to rename it I don't think
07:20 - it actually matters at this stage
07:22 - however as it stands we are securing our
07:27 - form as much as possible with regards to
07:30 - only allowing JPEG files to be uploaded
07:33 - we using the extension and the type
07:36 - obviously by changing this we've changed
07:38 - the type so we have a bit of a problem
07:40 - but nevertheless we'll just test this
07:43 - out quickly and type in an echo next to
07:45 - the type just to see what happens when
07:48 - we upload this let's click Submit yeah
07:51 - you can see it's imaged 4/2 trip that's
07:54 - just simply because we've renamed the
07:55 - file so I think for now we've we've
07:57 - secured it quite nicely our files have
08:01 - been uploaded and we've checked for the
08:04 - size
