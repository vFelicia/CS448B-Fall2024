00:01 - So today we're going to talk about two
00:04 - different kinds of um line ray or
00:08 - segments that have a special kind of
00:12 - relationship with a circle so a seant is
00:16 - a line ray or segment that contains a
00:19 - chord of a circle so if you
00:23 - look at this
00:26 - drawing where the blue lines
00:33 - are where the blue little dotted lines
00:36 - are those are chords of the circle so
00:39 - this
00:41 - line line
00:45 - DP this
00:49 - Ray
00:51 - [Music]
00:55 - LJ
00:58 - or and
01:01 - this segment
01:04 - km are all
01:08 - seant of this
01:13 - circle and we usually need a circle
01:16 - based on the center point so I'm going
01:20 - to
01:21 - just no that's not the center the center
01:24 - of the circle is about there and we're
01:25 - just going of all it C so of this Circle
01:28 - C
01:31 - now a tangent is a line ray or segment
01:35 - that contains exactly one point of the
01:37 - circle so it touches the
01:40 - circle at one point and only one point
01:43 - if it like if it's like this kind of a
01:47 - line see how it's here and here that's a
01:51 - secant not a tangent because it
01:54 - intercepts the circle once more than
01:57 - once so this Ray
02:01 - P
02:02 - J this
02:05 - segment a
02:07 - o and this line k
02:14 - l are all tangents of the circle PJ
02:19 - intercepts this circle at Point P
02:24 - only AO intercepts this circle at Point
02:29 - C only and K L intercepts this circle at
02:35 - K
02:36 - only so as long as there's only one
02:39 - point that this line r segment
02:41 - intercepts The Circle at it's a secant
02:45 - of the
02:47 - circle so that's actually all we're
02:49 - going to talk about
02:50 - today and in our next lesson we're going
02:54 - to talk about arcs and angles of a
02:57 - circle
