00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:02 - and this is a video tutorial for the new
00:04 - Boston in the last example we looked at
00:07 - classes properties and methods now in
00:10 - this example we're going to look at how
00:11 - we can put this into use and actually
00:14 - display out our balance so what I've
00:16 - already done is I've created a class
00:17 - called bank account which going to
00:19 - reference as a new bank account later
00:21 - and we've created a property called
00:24 - balance which is equal to zero now at
00:27 - the moment you may be thinking well I
00:29 - can do this normally in PHP so why would
00:31 - I change it the difference is is its
00:33 - structured so much better that later on
00:37 - what we can do is we can give a bank
00:39 - account two to three for a hundred
00:42 - people without having to store any
00:45 - particular information so we can we can
00:48 - create two different instances of this
00:50 - bank account and run along having two
00:52 - different balances so this object is
00:55 - reusable okay so in our public function
00:59 - display balance we need to echo out our
01:02 - balance so we're just going to basically
01:05 - simply say echo now usually in
01:09 - procedural PHP you'll think to yourself
01:11 - oh yep this is absolutely easy we're
01:12 - just going to say echo balance and then
01:14 - that's it however what we actually need
01:17 - to do is we need to reference the fact
01:19 - that we're taking a variable from this
01:21 - class itself now we've created the the
01:25 - balances public so we're able to use it
01:28 - wherever we like what we do is instead
01:30 - of just echoing out the balance itself
01:32 - we need to say echo this then we do a
01:36 - hyphen and a greater than sign so we're
01:40 - taking something from this and this as a
01:43 - variable with a with a dollar sign means
01:46 - this class in general so we're taking it
01:50 - we're echoing out a value from this now
01:53 - we need to specify the variable name now
01:55 - this might confuse you because what
01:57 - we're going to do is we're going to type
01:58 - the variable name like this we add the
02:02 - semicolon on the end so that's nothing
02:03 - to do with this but you'll notice that
02:05 - I've I reference the variable balance
02:08 - without the dollar sign so this is the
02:11 - way we
02:13 - prints variables when we're talking
02:15 - about within a class we just give the
02:18 - plain name and this will take the value
02:20 - of balance which is zero at the moment
02:22 - so at the moment we have created our
02:27 - balance to be zero earlier on and now
02:29 - we're echoing out this balance we're
02:32 - echoing out the balance here and you can
02:34 - do this with any other properties that
02:36 - you might have so we're essentially just
02:38 - echoing out our balance that's it so
02:41 - let's make this a bit more user-friendly
02:42 - before we begin I'm going to say balance
02:48 - : and then a space and then we're coming
02:51 - out the balance so how do we go about
02:54 - echoing this out now we can't just say
02:56 - echo something or bank account something
03:00 - what we need to do is we need to create
03:02 - a new instance of our of our class and
03:06 - our class name is bank account so let's
03:09 - let's create a variable called Alex for
03:12 - example so I've created a variable
03:13 - called Alex and this is going to be my
03:16 - new bank account so I'm going to say
03:18 - Alex equals new bank account so new is
03:24 - the key word we use in creating a new
03:26 - instance of our class so we're creating
03:28 - a new instance of our class which is
03:30 - going to be held inside Alex so what I
03:32 - can do now is I can say Alex and I can
03:34 - use this notation here to grab different
03:37 - things out of my class so what I can do
03:40 - is I can say Alex and then there so our
03:44 - - and our greater than sign and then
03:47 - what I can do is I can either echo out
03:51 - properties within my bank account or I
03:54 - can run method so I can say display
03:58 - balance so all I need to say is display
04:01 - balance so let's recap on what we've
04:04 - done we have created our method before
04:07 - and now what we've done in this part of
04:09 - the tutorial is we've echoed out this
04:11 - balance we've taken this variable here
04:13 - from this bank account okay so now what
04:16 - we've done is we've created a new
04:17 - variable called Alex and assign this to
04:20 - a new instance of the bank account class
04:23 - we don't need these parentheses here by
04:26 - the way sorry
04:27 - so we just need a bank account on its
04:30 - own so remember this is case sensitive
04:32 - so ensure you've got a capital B n/a for
04:34 - these two depending on what you name
04:36 - your class they classes can be all
04:38 - lowercase but it tends to be standard
04:41 - notation that you use camel caps or
04:43 - capital letters it's somewhere so it's
04:45 - easily to read or easy to read sorry so
04:48 - now what we're doing is we're taking
04:49 - this new instance of Alex and we're
04:51 - displaying the balance so remember
04:53 - you're going to need the parentheses
04:54 - here because it's a method within our
04:55 - class so let's go back to our page and
04:58 - refresh and see what we've got
05:00 - okay so we've been displayed with
05:02 - balance zero so we've successfully used
05:06 - a method within our class to read out or
05:10 - echo out rather a a property within our
05:15 - class so let's change this to 10.5 and
05:20 - let's refresh to see if that works
05:22 - ok yeah so the balance is now being
05:24 - updated so we have uhm yeah like I said
05:28 - before we've taken a method called
05:31 - display balance and we've echoed out the
05:33 - balance that's currently inside this
05:35 - bank account now when we create a new
05:38 - instance of this class in another
05:40 - variable this this property balance
05:44 - we'll be able to change depending on
05:46 - each each variable we assign this new
05:50 - bank account to so we'll look at that a
05:52 - bit later on but I just thought I'd
05:54 - mention it now because you may think
05:56 - that as it stands you could have done
05:58 - this just you know normally in PHP you
06:01 - wouldn't have had to use object-oriented
06:03 - programming so let's think about
06:06 - returning a value rather than displaying
06:10 - it so let's return balance so now what
06:13 - we can do is we can write echo here and
06:16 - we're basically echoing out the return
06:18 - value so when we refresh we get exactly
06:20 - the same thing up so this is probably a
06:22 - bit better way to do things just so
06:24 - you're returning a value and we can do
06:26 - whatever we want down here with the
06:28 - balance so it's exactly the same as
06:30 - functions in PHP we're returning a value
06:33 - from this method which is grabbing this
06:36 - property up here and then we're echoing
06:37 - out and
06:39 - so you can see that if we did it without
06:40 - the echo you're going to get basically
06:42 - nothing up on a screen because you're
06:44 - not doing anything with the return value
06:46 - so we can echo this we can even create a
06:48 - new variable for example called balance
06:51 - and that equal to our display balance
06:54 - however we're not going to be doing that
06:55 - for now
06:56 - because we could just going to be
06:57 - demonstrating echoing out different
06:59 - values
