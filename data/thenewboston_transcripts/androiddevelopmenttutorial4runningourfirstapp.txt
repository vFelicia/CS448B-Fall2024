00:00 - what is up guys it is Bucky and welcome
00:02 - to your fourth Android application
00:04 - development tutorial that's an awfully
00:07 - long name I better start calling them
00:09 - just Android tutorials welcome to your
00:10 - fourth Android tutorials and in this
00:13 - tutorial what we're going to be doing is
00:15 - we're going to be going over how to
00:16 - build a project and also how to set up
00:18 - our emulator now our emulator is pretty
00:21 - much a fake cell phone that we make on
00:24 - our computer so anyways you'll learn
00:27 - about that later but let's go ahead and
00:28 - start a new project so go ahead and get
00:30 - Eclipse open actually let me jot down
00:33 - the time 7:33 jot it down in my little
00:36 - diary so I know when I'm running out
00:38 - time anyways go ahead and openclips and
00:40 - in order to start a project do this file
00:44 - new project easy enough now we have a
00:47 - lot of different choices here but what
00:49 - we are looking for is Android so go
00:52 - ahead and expand that and Bam look what
00:54 - you got even more choices Android
00:57 - project and Android test project go
00:59 - ahead and select Android project and
01:02 - once that's selected the next uh little
01:05 - button should be able to click what's a
01:08 - good word for able to click clickable
01:10 - there we go that's the word I was
01:11 - looking for so we need to fill in this
01:14 - form exactly like I'm going to show you
01:17 - how and you need to do that for two
01:18 - reasons first of all if you fill it out
01:21 - differently than me then your project
01:22 - might not even work and second of all if
01:25 - you fill it out different than me then
01:27 - when you're following along with my
01:28 - tutorials it's going to be hard harder
01:30 - to follow along because we're going to
01:31 - have different libraries so anyways do
01:34 - exactly as I do for your project name
01:36 - this is irrelevant I'm going to name
01:38 - mine Bucky you name yours whatever you
01:40 - want for all of your contents right here
01:43 - go ahead and leave all these as default
01:45 - and that should mean this radio button
01:47 - that says create new project in
01:48 - workspace should be uh clicked and use
01:51 - default location should be checked and
01:54 - all the content means is pretty much
01:56 - where are you keeping all your files
01:58 - pretty much the location of your project
02:00 - so don't even worry about that by
02:02 - default it should be right in your
02:04 - workspace right where you want it now
02:06 - the build Target for this you want to
02:08 - select Android
02:10 - 2.2 and your build Target like you can
02:13 - see is pretty much the version of
02:15 - Android um not only what version they
02:19 - need on their device to run but also
02:21 - what libraries do we want to use so
02:23 - anyways go ahead stick with me just like
02:25 - Android 2.2 for
02:28 - consistency now for application name go
02:31 - ahead and name this the exact same as
02:33 - your project name so what if your
02:36 - project name is Bucky name that Bucky
02:38 - for your package name now I don't know
02:40 - if you guys know this you should from
02:42 - watching my jav tutorials but a package
02:45 - is just uh it's just how they organize
02:48 - classes in Java so go ahead and they
02:51 - have a weird system if you watch my
02:54 - iPhone development tutorials then it's
02:55 - kind of the same naming system but
02:58 - anyways you have to start with com
03:00 - always and kind of like each other class
03:03 - you separate them by period you know
03:06 - what I'm not going to go over package
03:07 - name me because well quite frankly it's
03:09 - boring but anyways just go ahead and
03:11 - write com doth newboston
03:14 - do
03:16 - um Android Dot and then just name your
03:19 - project whatever project name is Bucky
03:21 - if you want to look up how to name
03:23 - packages go ahead and Google it because
03:26 - uh it's pretty boring if you ask me but
03:28 - anyways when whenever you write create
03:31 - activity if this isn't checked by
03:33 - default go ahead and check it this means
03:35 - well it says right there spec specifies
03:38 - if you want to create a default activity
03:40 - and a default activity is this it's
03:44 - pretty much the first file that gets
03:46 - called or pretty much the first class
03:49 - that runs whenever you start your
03:51 - program so anyways go ahead and name
03:53 - this something like um
03:57 - main activity so with this is going to
04:00 - do is it's going to create a class
04:02 - called main activity and this is the
04:04 - first class that's going to be called
04:05 - whenever we run our device now on our
04:08 - minimum SDK version go ahead and type in
04:11 - the number eight and how do we know
04:13 - that's number eight check this out on
04:14 - our build Target Android 2.2 the API is
04:18 - eight right there so that's pretty much
04:20 - what it's asking what API and again like
04:23 - I said this is linked to your Android
04:26 - 2.2 and it's basically saying um what
04:29 - what's the minimum version of Android
04:32 - needed to run this application AKA what
04:35 - libraries do we want to use so anyways
04:37 - now that everything is set up this
04:40 - finish button should be clickable there
04:42 - you go so go ahead and why not click
04:43 - that just like that and now check this
04:46 - out right here we're getting errors in
04:48 - our project but if we wait a little bit
04:50 - then errors disappear that may confuse a
04:53 - couple of you guys first but let me tell
04:54 - you guys why that's happening if you're
04:56 - getting errors first of all just wait
04:59 - couple seconds and don't worry the
05:01 - reason you're getting errors is because
05:03 - this program compiles everything as it
05:06 - goes along so anyways it compiled
05:09 - everything and that pretty much means it
05:10 - checked our program before it was
05:12 - finished setting it up so it like set
05:15 - half of it up and then checked it for
05:16 - errors and it says Whoa you got half a
05:18 - program here I'm going to give you an
05:19 - error and then it finished setting up
05:21 - and then it was like my bad duh you're
05:24 - good to go so that's why the error went
05:26 - away so if you see error just hold your
05:29 - horses and uh yeah that's it just hold
05:32 - your horses so anyways go ahead and
05:34 - expand Source incom doth newboston
05:37 - Android Bucky and double click
05:39 - mainactivity.java and we see it already
05:42 - built this first class for us so check
05:44 - it out go ahead look around if uh you
05:48 - like what you see which you should then
05:50 - you can go ahead and run it just kidding
05:53 - I fold you you can't run it just yet and
05:55 - the reason for that is this in order to
06:00 - run how am I gonna say this in order to
06:03 - run a Android application on your
06:06 - computer you need something called an
06:09 - emulator now the most basic way I can
06:13 - describe you guys what emulator is it's
06:15 - a fake Android on your phone it's a fake
06:20 - Droid pretty much that you put on your
06:22 - computer so if you guys were foll along
06:25 - with my iPhone tutorials it's pretty
06:27 - much a simulator it simul Ates an
06:30 - Android device on your computer bam
06:32 - there I finally got it out so anyways we
06:34 - need to create one of these emulators to
06:37 - uh run on our computer so we're saying
06:39 - all right Bucky enough giving me the
06:41 - definition let's just go ahead and
06:42 - create one where here's what you do
06:44 - first of all go up to here where this
06:46 - little button is and it says opens the
06:48 - Android SDK and avd manager go ahead and
06:51 - click that and now let me move this over
06:55 - what we want to do is we want to create
06:56 - a new avd so so let's go ahead and click
07:00 - that and look at this box that pops up
07:03 - what we want to do is first give a name
07:05 - and I'm going to name mine like
07:08 - Biore phone because you know why not
07:11 - name it that and you also need to give
07:13 - it a Target and if you scroll over this
07:15 - you see the version of Android to use in
07:17 - the virtual device well make sure your
07:19 - target is the same however you set up
07:21 - your project and if you remember ours
07:23 - was an Android 2.2 level eight so go
07:26 - ahead and click that and all this stuff
07:28 - should be good by by default so let's go
07:30 - ahead and click create avd that looks
07:33 - good uh looks good has a nice little
07:35 - check boox and um it says a valid
07:37 - virtual device if it has a check you
07:40 - know it's good so let's just go ahead
07:41 - and X out of this so saying all right
07:45 - finally I'm ready to run this dang
07:46 - project well actually you need to do one
07:50 - more stupid thing and I promise you guys
07:52 - this is the last thing you need to do
07:54 - before you actually run this program you
07:57 - need to tell Eclipse that that is the
08:00 - fake Android that you want to use and
08:03 - first of all I apolog I apologize if I
08:06 - keep saying iPhone instead of Android
08:08 - it's just cuz I keep developing iPhone
08:10 - apps every day but anyways if I say
08:12 - iPhone accidentally then you know just
08:14 - deal with it but anyways what we need to
08:17 - do now is tell Eclipse that that is the
08:19 - Android emulator that we want to use
08:22 - when we're developing for this project
08:23 - so here's how you do this go up to run
08:26 - and select run configurations right
08:29 - there
08:30 - now what we need to do is click Android
08:33 - application expand that and click new
08:36 - configuration now we see all this crap
08:38 - that pops up and here's what we need to
08:40 - do in the name just go ahead and type in
08:44 - new configuration whatever they give you
08:46 - by default it doesn't really matter to
08:48 - be honest now in our project what we
08:50 - want to do is we want to browse and
08:52 - select whatever project we're working on
08:55 - or if you know the name of the project
08:56 - just go ahead and type it in I'll let
08:58 - you guys decide side on that one so now
09:01 - after this what we need to do is let me
09:03 - make sure I got everything new config
09:06 - Nam IT project yep we don't need to do
09:09 - anything with this all right the only
09:11 - other thing we need to do is go over to
09:13 - this little Target panel and we need to
09:16 - select well you can see right here
09:19 - select a preferred avd for deployment
09:21 - this is pretty much the fake Android
09:24 - that you want to use go ahead and select
09:26 - what one you want to use and then go
09:28 - ahead and you need to hit apply so go
09:32 - ahead hit apply and then well let's go
09:35 - ahead and X out of here all right so we
09:38 - have everything set up our what's it
09:41 - called our configuration or pretty much
09:43 - eclipse is configured to that emulator
09:45 - we're good to go now whenever you want
09:48 - to run this program or test it out the
09:50 - only thing you need to do is go up here
09:52 - and hit run new configurations so go
09:55 - ahead and hit this run button and check
09:57 - it out a bunch of boxes pop up and Bam
10:01 - look at this our program is running how
10:03 - awesome is this it says Android and it
10:06 - has a nice little blinky thing at the
10:08 - bottom and if you have any errors go
10:10 - ahead and Exile this if you have any
10:12 - errors then they're going to pop up down
10:14 - here but
10:15 - anyways we now have everything set up
10:18 - and we now should have whenever you
10:21 - click this button then our emulator in
10:24 - our program actually runs so if you're
10:27 - to this point then you're ready to move
10:29 - on to the next tutorial if you're not to
10:31 - this point yet then you did something
10:33 - wrong you need to watch this tutorial
