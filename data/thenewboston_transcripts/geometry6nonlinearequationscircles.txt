00:01 - so today we're moving on to circles now
00:05 - a circle comes in this form with with
00:12 - one little stipulation this is usually y
00:15 - minus a squared plus y minus B squared
00:21 - equals R squared with a B this Center so
00:27 - for this equation it's centered about 0
00:31 - 0 because we're not subtracting any
00:33 - numbers and then our radius is R so we
00:39 - would take the square root of both sides
00:41 - to solve for R and this isn't an action
00:44 - we don't have an actual number for our
00:47 - but what if I told you that x squared
00:50 - plus y squared is equal to 4 we would
00:54 - take the square root of 4 to find out
00:57 - what R equals so R equals 2 so our
01:01 - Center is at 0 0 I'm just gonna put that
01:03 - so you know but you remember a circle
01:07 - doesn't intersect its center so if we
01:14 - have a radius of 2 that means that every
01:21 - point is 2 away from the center so
01:29 - that's what our circle would look like
01:31 - okay so x squared plus y squared equals
01:35 - 4 this is what we just did so we're
01:37 - gonna skip this one X minus 1 squared
01:41 - plus y plus 1 squared equals 9 so first
01:46 - we're going to find out what our radius
01:47 - is our radius is equal to the square
01:50 - root of 9 so R is equal to positive and
01:53 - minus 3 now in this case our plus and
01:58 - minus tells us direction so it says our
02:01 - radius goes 3 to the right and it also
02:05 - goes 3 to the left so our center if you
02:09 - remember it
02:20 - comes in this form a B so our a is
02:26 - positive one our B is negative one so
02:32 - that's our Center so I'm going to plot
02:33 - that one negative one so this is our
02:36 - Center and our radius goes three in each
02:40 - direction so up three left three and
02:48 - down three so there's our circle and I
02:55 - know it's not perfectly a circle I don't
02:57 - have a compass with me right now and
03:03 - that's all actually for our equations of
03:07 - circles but make sure you come back
03:10 - where we're going to talk about a third
03:12 - nonlinear equation called an ellipse
