00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org
00:02 - and this is a video tutorial created for
00:04 - the New Boston now in this tutorial I'm
00:07 - going to be talking about exception
00:08 - handling
00:09 - now exception handling is a different
00:11 - way to handle errors in PHP that your
00:13 - program might output and it's used to
00:15 - change the flow of your program usually
00:17 - to save the current state of the program
00:20 - while you throw the error and there's
00:22 - loads and loads of different ways to do
00:23 - that but before we get into it the
00:26 - different parts of this tutorial and
00:30 - parts relative to exception handling
00:32 - will go through different ways and
00:35 - you'll eventually try and understand how
00:37 - it helps I'm not going to do too much
00:39 - explaining for now but meanwhile follow
00:41 - a little more example test out the code
00:43 - and try and work out for yourself
00:47 - how this is best worked out and where
00:49 - you should best use it so I'm going to
00:52 - create an example and this is going to
00:55 - be a function that's dividing by a
00:56 - number so dividing two numbers so let's
00:59 - set the skeleton up for our function
01:02 - it's just basically function divided and
01:05 - then we're going to supply it with two
01:07 - arguments so it's number one and number
01:10 - two
01:10 - now with division by zero we need to
01:13 - incorporate this into our function to
01:16 - ensure that division by zero doesn't
01:18 - occur now number two cannot be zero
01:21 - number one can be zero because when we
01:23 - divide 0 by 0 let's just bring up a
01:26 - calculator actually so let's say we've
01:31 - got 0 divided by 10 is 0 so that's
01:34 - absolutely find that operations
01:36 - completed now what about 10 divided by
01:38 - zero cannot divide by zero so number one
01:41 - can't equal zero at any point in this
01:44 - function when we call it with the
01:46 - parameters the arguments put in so we
01:49 - first of all need to create an if
01:50 - statement to say if num2 is equal to
01:54 - zero then we need to do something else
01:59 - we need to echo a nope we don't we need
02:03 - to return sorry
02:06 - num 1 divided by num2 so let's test out
02:11 - the
02:12 - the divide function we've just created
02:15 - so we're going to echo out divided and
02:17 - we're going to say ten and five for
02:21 - example so 10 divided by 5 is 2 so we
02:24 - should return this operation because
02:28 - num2 does not equal zero so let's come
02:32 - and refresh you can see that we've been
02:34 - returned with the value 2 so now what
02:37 - happens if we supply it with 0 let's go
02:43 - back here and pull up let's apply this
02:44 - form of 0 and refresh and so obviously
02:52 - nothing's happening at the moment
02:53 - because inside our block nothing's
02:55 - happening but or there's not no code
02:58 - inside our block but what happens if we
03:00 - want to throw a new exception so these
03:02 - this is the simplest way to throw an
03:05 - exception we would say throw new
03:08 - exception and in here we can specify a
03:13 - custom error message that's going to be
03:15 - sent through with the error so cannot
03:18 - divide by 0 now why do we use a
03:25 - exception handling and why do we throw
03:27 - new exceptions now the reason is we
03:30 - usually in this case do it to substitute
03:34 - the error message we give an error out
03:37 - but we don't use the default PHP error
03:39 - message we don't want to do that because
03:41 - we don't want to show it to our users in
03:45 - the way that we've created a PHP error
03:47 - like that's just one way that we might
03:49 - use to do this so let's go back here and
03:53 - press refresh and see the difference in
03:55 - air we've got so here we've got uncaught
03:59 - exception exception with message cannot
04:02 - divide by 0 in this file and it gives us
04:07 - a host of other information as well and
04:08 - tells us where it's thrown so it's
04:10 - thrown on line 5 which is here that one
04:13 - here now so this is a basic idea of
04:17 - throwing an exception now the reason
04:20 - we're not we're not returning a we're
04:24 - telling a fatal error we are
04:25 - returning a fatal error is because we
04:27 - don't have a block to catch this
04:29 - exception and to do this we use a try
04:33 - throw and catch statement I'm not going
04:38 - to explain this in this example but
04:39 - we're going to do that in the next video
04:41 - and this is going to allow us to make
04:44 - things a bit more custom so for now we
04:46 - throw an exception without a catch so
04:48 - we've been given a fatal error which
04:50 - looks like this in the browser but later
04:52 - on we're going to work with the try
04:54 - throwing catch to make everything flow
04:58 - just a little bit better
