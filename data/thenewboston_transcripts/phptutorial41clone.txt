00:00 - what's up guys is Bucky and welcome to
00:02 - your 41st PHP tutorial and in this
00:05 - tutorial we're gonna be talking about
00:06 - something called cloning
00:09 - now what cloning is is it's a way to
00:12 - take an object and pretty much clone it
00:14 - make a duplicate of it but you just
00:16 - can't you know set one object equal to
00:18 - another object and expect everything to
00:20 - work fine because well we didn't really
00:23 - cover references or anything like that
00:24 - but it just doesn't work like that
00:26 - so we need a clone an object a special
00:30 - way whenever we want a copy of it so
00:32 - let's go ahead and I decided for this
00:35 - tutorial what I'm gonna do is kind of
00:37 - recap everything I learned instead of
00:39 - just teaching you just about cloning so
00:41 - I'm gonna show you everything we learn
00:43 - and that's how to set up a class
00:46 - properly and by doing so I'm gonna teach
00:51 - you cloning so let's go ahead in the
00:53 - setup class called person and it's gonna
00:55 - have to have a couple attributes in it
00:57 - so class person and let's go ahead and
01:02 - make two private variables one is called
01:04 - age and let's go ahead and just copy
01:08 - that and let's go ahead and name this
01:12 - one color so say we're making a class of
01:15 - people and we want to record their age
01:18 - in their favorite color or something
01:20 - like that so let's make function set H
01:25 - and go ahead and pass the X and go ahead
01:31 - remember this age is equal to X so now
01:37 - whenever we want to set this age all we
01:40 - have to do is pass in the variable and
01:41 - wham bam thank you ma'am there you go so
01:43 - let's go ahead and copy this and we'll
01:45 - do the same thing for color but we'll
01:47 - change the name set color and this color
01:51 - so how easy is that you just go ahead
01:53 - copy change couple key words in there
01:55 - you go
01:56 - so now that we have our setters let's go
01:58 - ahead and build our getters to get you
02:01 - know
02:02 - age or the color so this is even easier
02:05 - than the setter function get aged empty
02:11 - parameters because we're not passing any
02:12 - new information we're just getting
02:14 - information and all we wanted to do is
02:17 - return this age in this case and now for
02:24 - our color let's go ahead and copy that
02:27 - and all this function is gonna do is get
02:30 - color and it's gonna of course return
02:33 - color so the basics as you can see we
02:36 - have two properties right now in age and
02:38 - color in this class this one sets the
02:41 - age this one sets the color this one
02:43 - gets the age this one gets the color
02:45 - easy enough so now let's go ahead and
02:48 - finally build some objects so I can show
02:50 - you guys pretty much what cloning is and
02:54 - why it's useful the first thing we need
02:57 - to do is let me just add some space
02:59 - right there in let's go ahead and make
03:01 - person called Bucky and set this equal
03:05 - to a new person because if you remember
03:07 - from up here our class was called person
03:09 - so Bucky as a new person it doesn't have
03:12 - any constructor so we don't need any
03:14 - parameters for that let's go ahead and
03:16 - populate his age and his color so let's
03:20 - go ahead and do that right now in order
03:22 - to do this you go type the name of your
03:25 - object put set age and of course my age
03:29 - is 23 actually it's 23 for let's see 1 2
03:32 - 3 more days so my birthday in three days
03:35 - so let's go ahead and now Bucky's age is
03:38 - 23 so now all he needs is a favorite
03:41 - color so Bucky what was it it was set
03:44 - color yeah set color and for the
03:48 - parameter type my favorite color can
03:49 - anyone guess and you wanted it oh it's
03:52 - actually blue blue and white they're
03:54 - tied but you know this only asked for
03:56 - one set so I'm gonna give it so now we
03:59 - have an object called Bucky and he
04:01 - belongs to the class person so Bucky has
04:05 - a favorite number that's 23 and Bucky
04:07 - also has a favorite color and that's
04:10 - blue but what if I have a twin
04:13 - named Tommy well in order to create an
04:18 - exact copy of the subject we just can't
04:21 - do this or else it gives us a whole
04:22 - bunch of issues because an object isn't
04:25 - just another variable with a value an
04:28 - object kind of has is a special variable
04:32 - because it has a bunch of different
04:34 - values and a bunch of different methods
04:35 - so it's not just one value or copy in
04:38 - here so that's why we can't just do that
04:40 - so what PHP did is said whenever you
04:43 - want to copy an object to another object
04:45 - go ahead and use a special keyword
04:47 - called clone and now type the object you
04:50 - want to copy so it's kind of like
04:52 - copying the variable but you just need
04:53 - to remember to put that special keyword
04:55 - clone right before the object that you
04:57 - want to copy so now Tommy is an exact
05:00 - copy of Bucky Tommy's favorite color is
05:04 - blue and Tommy's age is 23 so let's go
05:07 - ahead and change one of those parameters
05:09 - so when I output it you can see that
05:11 - this is actually a little bit different
05:13 - so Tommy let's go ahead and set his
05:17 - favorite color too
05:20 - no let's say it's red or something and
05:23 - let make sure I have all my semicolons
05:25 - go good enough all right just making
05:28 - sure I got my semicolons right there all
05:30 - right so now what we did is we created a
05:33 - person called Bucky who's 23 favorite
05:35 - color blue now Tommy whenever we call
05:38 - him his favorite color was blue and his
05:41 - favorite number 23 but then we decided
05:43 - to make his favorite color red so now
05:45 - Tommy is the exact same age as Bucky
05:48 - which is 23 they're both 23 but they
05:50 - just have different favorite colors now
05:52 - so when we echo that if everything
05:53 - worked out perfectly that's what we
05:55 - should see so let's go ahead and echo
05:57 - everything right now let's echo both of
05:59 - Bucky stuff so Bucky remember get aged
06:04 - and of course it doesn't take any
06:06 - parameters and let's just go ahead and
06:07 - you can't Nate it with a break so when
06:11 - we output it in our browser everything
06:13 - will look all nice and neat and let me
06:16 - go ahead and echo this that goes
06:17 - favorite number two actually you just go
06:20 - ahead and copy this I mean if a guy
06:22 - suddenly
06:22 - all right Bucky you get age Bucky get
06:25 - color so what this is gonna do is it's
06:28 - gonna echo 23 and blue easy enough so
06:31 - let's go ahead and copy all that because
06:33 - you're way too lazy to type it and now
06:35 - let's echo out Tommy's information Tommy
06:38 - Tommy Tommy is actually the name of my
06:40 - cousin's in case you guys are wondering
06:42 - go ahead and send them some mail and
06:44 - check this out the first thing that's
06:47 - gonna do is echo out 23 and blue because
06:49 - that's Bucky's information that's the
06:52 - original information we got
06:53 - but we made a clone of Bucky called
06:55 - Tommy right here now Tommy's age is the
06:58 - same but we changed his favorite color
07:00 - right here to red so this age should be
07:02 - twenty three stroke still but his
07:04 - favorite color should be red so if
07:06 - everything went nice and neat and we
07:08 - didn't get in heirs or forgot any
07:09 - semicolons or anything like that that's
07:12 - what it should display so refresh send
07:15 - yes and check this out
07:17 - whoa definitely I went back to notepad
07:19 - and set my browser there but anyways
07:21 - check this out
07:23 - it didn't update for some reason update
07:26 - yes and there we go
07:31 - 23 blue that's Bucky's information Tommy
07:34 - same age 23 but his favorite color is
07:37 - red just like that so how awesome is
07:40 - that that uh you know its basic
07:43 - basically what clone does right there it
07:46 - pretty much takes one object and allows
07:49 - it to clone another object and there's
07:51 - one more little thing I want to teach
07:53 - you guys about cloning objects but I
07:54 - don't know how long it's gonna take and
07:56 - I'll probably run out of time
07:58 - so anyways and this story what we did is
08:00 - I taught you guys about cloning
08:01 - and I also recaps pretty much everything
08:04 - we learned in the past how to create a
08:06 - class why should make private variables
08:09 - and public functions again um never mind
08:13 - by anyways I'm not gonna tell you guys
08:15 - what we just learned because you just
08:16 - watch this whole tutorial if you want to
08:18 - know what we're just learning again then
08:19 - watch this or again anyways thank you
08:21 - guys for watching a ninety nine how to
08:23 - clone objects now you're ready to move
08:24 - on to the next step in our object
08:26 - oriented programming adventure so
08:31 - yeah that's all I have for you guys so
08:34 - uh enjoy the tour Oh check out my
08:36 - website and have a Merry Christmas or
08:38 - Happy Holidays if you juice see it
