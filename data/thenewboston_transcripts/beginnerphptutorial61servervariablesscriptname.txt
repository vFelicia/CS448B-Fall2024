00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org
00:02 - and this is a video tutorial for the new
00:04 - Boston now in this video tutorial and
00:07 - the video tutorials that are going to
00:09 - come after this and in the short server
00:11 - series are talking about a predefined
00:14 - variable in PHP called dollar underscore
00:17 - server now you may have seen this before
00:20 - if you've dealt with PHP before server
00:24 - is a predefined set of environmental
00:29 - information and it allows you to let's
00:33 - just go back to up it allows you to
00:36 - access certain information about the
00:39 - page the user requests that have been
00:42 - sent for example so in this video we're
00:44 - going to be looking at the file name and
00:46 - how it can be useful to us now how do we
00:50 - go about doing this so I've already
00:51 - shown you the the variable name which is
00:54 - dollar underscore server so it's much
00:56 - like things like dollar underscore post
00:58 - and does underscore session so if you're
01:01 - learning PHP for the first time you're
01:02 - probably starting to see some kind of
01:04 - resemblance to with all these so what do
01:08 - we do if we want to echo out or display
01:11 - to the user the current file name
01:14 - of the PHP script that we're on now you
01:16 - wouldn't necessarily in everyday
01:18 - applications want to do this because you
01:20 - know the user can already see the file
01:23 - name and we're working within the next
01:25 - stop PHP at the moment we've got this
01:28 - error because we haven't specified
01:29 - anything but yeah we can already see the
01:31 - script name so why would we want to do
01:33 - this
01:33 - well it's useful for us when with doing
01:36 - things like submitting forms for example
01:38 - you specify your the the key inside of
01:44 - here so I'm going to say script
01:47 - underscore name now what this is going
01:50 - to do is it's going to take the script
01:52 - name and it's going to apply it into a
01:54 - variable so I'm going to say script name
01:57 - you can just echo it out straight away
01:59 - like this but I'm going to put it into a
02:01 - variable so it's just a bit easier to
02:02 - see what we're doing so we've got the
02:06 - script name here and we're using the
02:07 - predefined server variable and this is
02:10 - the environmental information that we're
02:12 - we're putting through
02:13 - so we've got script underscore name in
02:14 - capital letters now we're echoing this
02:16 - script name so let's test this and see
02:18 - what we get okay so we've got forward
02:20 - slash series forward slash server
02:22 - forward slash index now you can see this
02:24 - corresponds somewhat to my URL in the
02:28 - sense that we're not including the
02:30 - domain name at the moment I'm working
02:32 - locally on my computer but we we don't
02:34 - include the we're not including the
02:36 - domain name so why is this useful now
02:42 - let's say we wanted to submit a form but
02:44 - we didn't know the far the name that the
02:47 - the name of the file that the user was
02:50 - actually currently on for example let's
02:52 - create another file and we'll put a form
02:55 - in and we'll have the action of this
03:02 - well we'll leave the action out that's
03:04 - the point
03:05 - so method equals post and in here we'll
03:09 - just create a submit button equals
03:15 - submit name equals submit and value
03:22 - equals submit now I've given this a name
03:25 - so you can keep track of when this
03:27 - button has actually been pressed so
03:29 - let's save this as header Inc dot PHP
03:32 - now what I'm going to do with this is
03:33 - I'm going to include it in the top of my
03:35 - script so you should have already had a
03:37 - look at the include function already so
03:40 - heading PHP now what this is going to do
03:44 - is it's going to include this inside of
03:46 - our script so let's just check that out
03:48 - and see what happens
03:49 - okay so now we've included this button
03:51 - here now what happens if we want to I
03:55 - mean at the moment I've left action
03:57 - blank what happens if we have another
03:59 - page so I'm going to create another PHP
04:01 - page here another page dot PHP what
04:08 - happens if we had another page and we
04:10 - were including this file as well so
04:12 - header Inc dot PHP now what I want to do
04:16 - is I want to have let's just get rid of
04:18 - this for now
04:19 - I want to submit this this form but I
04:25 - won the action to be updated depending
04:27 - on what page I'm on because if I was to
04:29 - say have this button here but I had
04:33 - let's say if is set dollar underscore
04:39 - post submit echo we could say anything
04:50 - really process one this process might be
04:57 - say registering the user if that makes
04:59 - sense let's just copy and paste this
05:01 - over to the other page but we can now
05:05 - call this process to so on index.php
05:07 - we're dealing with process one and on
05:09 - here we're dealing with process two
05:11 - however we've got the same form so what
05:14 - happens if we want to say submit it to
05:17 - and this information the button come
05:21 - back to index.php or on this one the
05:24 - button to come back to index another
05:26 - page dot PHP so in here I could type
05:28 - index dot PHP so we've solved half of
05:31 - our problem so let's refresh the page
05:33 - and I click Submit and it comes up with
05:35 - process one but now if we access the
05:38 - other page you can see that when I click
05:43 - Submit we go back to index dot PHP
05:45 - however what I want to do is stay on
05:47 - another page dot PHP but process this
05:51 - here so how are we going to go about
05:54 - this well the answer is simple we've
05:55 - already looked at this we've already
06:00 - looked at this script file name or
06:03 - script name so what we can do is we can
06:07 - specify a full filename so we could say
06:10 - a script name equals and and this could
06:17 - be relative obviously to server and in
06:21 - here we could type let's say um
06:24 - script name now what's happened here is
06:27 - we have we've created a something that's
06:34 - going to be dynamically updated
06:35 - depending on what page they're on so
06:37 - this header include is included on index
06:40 - and another page but when we run index
06:42 - this will be different and we're on
06:44 - another page this will be different
06:46 - again so let's change this action here
06:49 - and update it dynamically so we can set
06:52 - PHP tags to to put this in here and we
06:56 - can just echo out scripts name so now
06:58 - what's going to happen is whatever page
07:00 - we're on let's just view the source you
07:03 - can see that form action equals another
07:05 - page dot PHP there with the long live
07:08 - filenames that were with directories
07:10 - that we're currently in
07:11 - however when wait on index.php you can
07:17 - see that it's automatically changed
07:18 - again
07:19 - so obviously this isn't going to work at
07:21 - the mic well it will because the way
07:23 - everything's set up so let's go over to
07:27 - another page and we click submit and
07:32 - we've done that so we've used the same
07:34 - form to process but on two different
07:36 - pages now how will this be useful in a
07:38 - real life application now let's say this
07:40 - submit button had a form field which was
07:42 - username and password and you wanted to
07:45 - log your users in but keep them on the
07:47 - same page as they are you could use a
07:50 - form to log your user in everything
07:52 - could work out so you find and then what
07:54 - you could do is using this variable that
07:56 - we've we've set here you could redirect
07:58 - them back to the page that they
08:00 - submitted the user login from so most
08:02 - websites you have the username and
08:03 - password at the top of the page and you
08:06 - will return to the page that you are
08:07 - currently reviewing before you logged on
08:09 - so that's a really useful way of using
08:12 - that server predefined environmental
08:14 - variable
