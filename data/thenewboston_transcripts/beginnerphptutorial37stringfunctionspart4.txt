00:00 - okay so let's move on let's go on to the
00:05 - trim
00:05 - now there's three different types of
00:07 - trim there's trim in general there's El
00:09 - trim and there's our trim so let's go
00:12 - ahead and say string trimmed equals trim
00:16 - and that is string here string so why is
00:21 - this function useful well what this
00:23 - world what it will do first is it will
00:24 - trim the white space from the left and
00:28 - the right hand side of a string so if
00:30 - we've got white space here and we've got
00:32 - white space here this function will just
00:34 - return this itself so let's go ahead and
00:38 - first of all echo out the string so we
00:40 - can see what we've got here
00:43 - I'm refresh okay so you can see that I
00:46 - know that's because it's going to return
00:47 - I'll eyes now well I'm not sure how to
00:50 - show you this as an example but we could
00:53 - go ahead an echo string trimmed so this
00:59 - is just basically going to return the
01:01 - trimmed string think if we go ahead and
01:06 - put in & nbsp
01:11 - in there cool and we put that at the end
01:16 - as well which is an HTML space and let's
01:20 - echo out string
01:24 - okay yeah so now we've got a space at
01:26 - the start and the end of our string
01:28 - let's go ahead now and echo out string
01:30 - trimmed and should produce oh no because
01:35 - I'm using HTML data anyway okay so let
01:38 - me just explain this rather than
01:39 - demonstrate it if we were to have a
01:42 - string like this why might we have a
01:43 - string like this well let's say you are
01:45 - feeding in values from a from a text
01:50 - file for example and you'd use say an
01:52 - explode function to get each value
01:55 - separated by comma into into a string
02:01 - you may have white space on either side
02:04 - now this might affect if statements
02:05 - because you might be comparing let's say
02:07 - if the certain value is equal to this
02:10 - that I've just highlighted in blue when
02:12 - in actual fact it might equal this which
02:14 - I've highlighted in blue so might have
02:15 - white space either side we can use this
02:18 - trim function to trim the white space
02:21 - from the left and the right which will
02:23 - then just result in the string itself
02:25 - here so that's the trim function
02:28 - alternatively if you just wanted to trim
02:31 - the left hand side white space you can
02:33 - use L trim and vice versa if you wanted
02:36 - to trim the right hand side white space
02:37 - you can use our trim so that is the our
02:40 - trim function and the left and the
02:43 - standard trim of course okay so the last
02:46 - we're going to talk about is that mainly
02:49 - for security purposes let's go ahead and
02:52 - say string is equal to this is a string
02:58 - maybe and here we could yet well we'll
03:01 - leave it as now this is the add slashes
03:04 - function so slashes equals add slashes
03:08 - and we'll supply that with the string so
03:13 - let's go ahead and echo out string
03:16 - slashes to see the result that we've got
03:20 - okay nothing at the moment now let's go
03:23 - ahead and add in image source equals
03:27 - something so image jpg for example now
03:32 - the first thing is when we test this
03:34 - you'll see that it's added slashes
03:35 - before this and and this double
03:39 - quotation mark no it hasn't so okay so
03:48 - okay
03:53 - let's go ahead and get rid of this
03:55 - injustice lash in so for that you would
03:57 - use the HTML entities function if you
03:59 - wanted to remove the remove the you know
04:06 - the HTML code as a whole so let's go
04:09 - back to that actually and we'll use the
04:11 - HTML entities function in here and let's
04:16 - go ahead and refresh okay sorry so that
04:26 - has a underscore somewhere there no okay
04:34 - so what have I done wrong here and HTML
04:37 - entities
04:43 - nope that was my spelling so you can see
04:46 - now that we've produced a string with
04:50 - this that data here so what we've done
04:52 - is we've used the add slashes to add
04:54 - slashes just in here let's go ahead and
04:56 - remove this add slashes function and you
05:01 - can see that that's just produced on its
05:03 - own so why is this HTML entity sorry why
05:07 - is this add slashes function useful
05:10 - well it's useful so we don't we don't
05:12 - pass anything that we don't want to for
05:14 - example with them SQL injection which I
05:17 - do have another video on so go ahead and
05:18 - and watch that if you haven't already
05:20 - and if you've used database databases
05:23 - before that'll be useful but add slashes
05:25 - is basically going to add our slashes to
05:30 - escape different characters for security
05:33 - purposes so now what we can do is go
05:36 - ahead and say echo strip slashes and
05:44 - then we go so let's go ahead and get rid
05:49 - of that there and you can see that we've
05:52 - got rid of them so we've added slashes
05:55 - here and we've stripped slashes here
05:56 - let's just get rid of that again so you
05:58 - can see the difference there so why
06:01 - would you want to strip slashes well for
06:04 - example data may be stored in a database
06:07 - if it was going to be produced on to a
06:09 - page for viewing and you might want to
06:12 - strip the slashes or add the slashes
06:15 - rather so this isn't passed as HTML code
06:17 - now why would you want to strip the
06:19 - slashes if you were say putting this
06:21 - data back into a text box for people to
06:24 - edit so you might have this in an input
06:26 - text box you'll want to strip the
06:28 - slashes before you put it into a text
06:30 - box for people to edit and then you want
06:32 - to obviously add slashes when it's going
06:34 - to be viewed as plain text on a page
06:38 - anywhere on your website so what if you
06:41 - ever find you need to get rid of these
06:43 - to allow you know either for SQL SQL
06:49 - query security or just a display data in
06:54 - your page securely then the add slashes
06:57 - is is the function to use and to remove
07:00 - this it strip slashes which will then
07:03 - allow you to view the plain data so
07:06 - that's a short collection of string
07:08 - functions in PHP there are many more you
07:11 - can go to the PHP manual php.net have a
07:13 - look through the string functions but
07:15 - these are the ones that I tend to use
07:17 - apart from the string reverse I tend to
07:21 - use I on a regular basis when I'm coding
07:24 - so yet they're the string functions in
07:27 - PHP
