00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to be working
00:07 - more on the car program now I've got a
00:10 - lot lined up for this tutorial and it
00:11 - will probably end up be uh being split
00:14 - into more than one part for this one
00:16 - tutorial uh so I might switch back and
00:19 - forth between different points that I
00:20 - want to talk about so if you
00:23 - remember um the only type of car we've
00:27 - been working with is the car we have not
00:29 - been using sports cars or trucks um with
00:32 - new car or the name or the color or the
00:34 - doors uh Etc so what we want to do is be
00:38 - able to add trucks and sports cars to
00:40 - our um to our list right here and access
00:45 - the attributes of them so let's go over
00:47 - here to form
00:49 - one and now I showed you a way of using
00:52 - selected car uh to get the selected uh
00:57 - car that's at the
00:58 - index well now what we can do is instead
01:02 - of having that being limited to only
01:04 - being a car we can come down here to
01:07 - button set
01:09 - name and we can get the item uh at the
01:12 - index of the cars array list so we'll
01:17 - just type
01:19 - cars and then we'll do list
01:23 - cars. selected
01:27 - index so what this is going to do is
01:29 - it's going to get the car name of the
01:30 - car at the selected index of where they
01:33 - selected it so this can be a sports car
01:35 - or a truck or just a normal
01:38 - car and it will get the car name value
01:41 - of
01:42 - that so let's just go ahead and change
01:46 - some of these values so we'll
01:49 - type
01:50 - um cars and then that index of list
01:55 - cars. selected
01:57 - index now we could go through and um
02:00 - manually change each one of these but
02:02 - there's an easier way to do this we can
02:04 - just go ahead and press
02:05 - crlf and it will bring up the find and
02:08 - replace menu so what do we want to find
02:11 - we want to find
02:12 - selected
02:14 - car so you can see that it went ahead
02:16 - and found the next one for us we can go
02:19 - ahead and replace this with cars at
02:23 - index of list
02:24 - cars. selected
02:28 - length
02:31 - not length why did I say selected
02:33 - index so let's just go
02:36 - ahead and get this out of here and we'll
02:40 - replace all or we'll just go ahead and
02:42 - replace this one right here ah quit
02:44 - dropping in there so we'll replace
02:49 - replace and let's make this a little bit
02:56 - smaller we'll just keep replacing until
02:59 - we get back up up to
03:02 - the um first selected
03:05 - car which is right there okay so now
03:10 - that we've replaced all of these inside
03:12 - of our uh button event
03:14 - handlers let's go ahead and test it out
03:18 - and see if it works so we'll minimize
03:21 - these just to organize the code a little
03:25 - better and we'll run
03:27 - this so we'll select Mustang GT we'll
03:31 - set the name of it and you can see we
03:32 - get old name Mustang GT we can just name
03:35 - it the on live gamer GT click okay and
03:39 - it's going to update it for
03:41 - us so that way we can use objects of
03:44 - type other than selected
03:48 - cars so now what we can do is we can
03:52 - allow the user to build a different kind
03:55 - of car in their new car uh form right
03:58 - here so we can have them make a truck or
04:02 - a car or a sports car so to do this
04:04 - let's go ahead and come over to form
04:08 - [Music]
04:09 - 1.vob box right here now this isn't the
04:13 - best looking program but you guys can
04:14 - change it around uh to whatever you want
04:16 - to make it look a little bit
04:18 - better so here's our combo box and we
04:22 - want to go ahead and go to the
04:23 - collections in the
04:25 - property or
04:27 - the items
04:30 - so we'll add car truck and sports
04:37 - car and so now if we click okay the user
04:40 - has the option to choose either a car
04:42 - truck or sports car when they create a
04:45 - new
04:46 - car so just like
04:51 - that now let's go ahead and come over
04:53 - here to our new car. VB and what we're
04:56 - going to do is we are going to create a
04:58 - public variable called called vehicle
05:02 - type as uh let's say
05:06 - string so whenever the user selects
05:10 - something from the combo box and clicks
05:11 - new car we're going to get what they
05:13 - selected and use it in our new car form
05:15 - so instead of saying name of car it'll
05:17 - it might say name of truck or name of
05:19 - sports car so we'll come back over here
05:22 - to
05:23 - for.vp and whenever they click button
05:26 - create car it's going to call the create
05:28 - car method that we have so what we need
05:30 - to
05:32 - do is we need to come down here we have
05:36 - our add new car form it's a new car form
05:39 - and we show the
05:41 - dialogue so now what we need to do is
05:43 - use an if statement so if and we need to
05:47 - come back in here and rename our combo
05:49 - box to something uh that is easy to
05:53 - remember so we'll do combo card
05:57 - types go back to the code
06:00 - so if combo car
06:02 - types um
06:06 - dot selected
06:09 - index is equal to let's say zero which
06:12 - is
06:14 - car or at least I think it
06:18 - is yeah we got car truck and then sports
06:20 - car so if the index is zero then what do
06:23 - we want to do we want
06:25 - to run everything that is in here
06:30 - so we'll just come down here and then
06:33 - type end if once again so if the
06:36 - selected index is equal to zero we want
06:38 - to uh have it show the new car uh form
06:42 - and it's going to create a new car
06:44 - object but we want to go ahead and set
06:47 - the
06:49 - um the string from new car that is our
06:53 - vehicle
06:54 - type so we want to set um add new car we
07:00 - want to set the um vehicle type to the
07:03 - type that they have
07:04 - selected so we're going to go ahead
07:08 - and copy this so if it's equal to zero
07:13 - then we want to go ahead and set the
07:16 - appropriate values so add new car.
07:18 - vehicle
07:20 - type
07:21 - equals combo car types do
07:26 - selected and let's see is it item
07:35 - oh yeah let's do selected item that
07:37 - should give
07:39 - us sorry about that alarm but that
07:42 - should give us the text that is inside
07:45 - of the combo box so whatever the vehicle
07:47 - type is it's going to send that back to
07:49 - our new car object that we've
07:52 - created
