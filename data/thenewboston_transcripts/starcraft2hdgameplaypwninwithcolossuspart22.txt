00:00 - what's going on guys welcome back to
00:02 - your second part of my Starcraft 2
00:04 - gameplay video and right off the bat you
00:06 - can see that flying pan which was a Zerg
00:08 - player on our team has either been like
00:11 - booted or just decided to leave go get
00:13 - some coffee or something but anyways the
00:15 - worst possible timing cuz he is about to
00:17 - go in for a massive attack and now you
00:20 - can see that the AR other Army has
00:21 - scouted him saw that big yellow wave
00:24 - just rushing toward their uh teammates
00:26 - building so looks like they're not going
00:28 - to be able to get there in time bunch of
00:30 - Bings busting through that wall
00:32 - zerglings rushing in but you see that
00:34 - dark Templar our enemy's dark Templar
00:36 - just slicing through them looks like
00:38 - those zerong are going to be able to
00:40 - pick off a bunch of those Marines and
00:42 - also yeah there looks like he's going to
00:43 - be able to pick off that dark Templar
00:45 - and now Dom coming in trying to take out
00:47 - that Templar building but I don't know
00:49 - if he's going to be quite able to pick
00:51 - it off oh that would have been great if
00:53 - he was but he isn't there's just too
00:55 - many stalkers too many marines and also
00:57 - Marauders uh those voides in those
01:00 - zerglings really had no chance there but
01:02 - they did do a lot of damage did look
01:04 - like they busted up one of their Supply
01:06 - Depot in their Barracks so overall I'll
01:08 - would say that was quite the success so
01:10 - anyways now that their teammates are
01:12 - done being defended they're going to go
01:14 - back to their own base uh get ready for
01:16 - a push or maybe just go back for some
01:19 - defense but anyways here is me and the
01:22 - person that I'm going to be pushing out
01:23 - with jester he got a nice mix of Marines
01:26 - and Marauders and also looked like he
01:27 - had a medac and some Ravens or something
01:30 - I see one Raven metac and pretty much a
01:33 - nice mix of Marines and Marauders and I
01:36 - am have two Colossus right now some
01:39 - stalkers and Immortals so we are looking
01:41 - good we're going to be moving in soon
01:43 - but uh I just want to get everything
01:45 - queued up make sure I don't waste any
01:47 - resources right now pump out some more
01:49 - Colossus and I'll tell you why since
01:51 - they have a bunch of level one units
01:53 - whenever we go in they're usually going
01:55 - to be a clump together like you see they
01:56 - are right there so those Colossus now
01:59 - that they have that area attack is going
02:01 - to be really useful in picking all of
02:03 - them off in one fell sweep so those
02:06 - stalkers are also in trouble now that I
02:08 - have Immortals since Immortals pretty
02:10 - much are the best thing that you can
02:12 - have against stalkers so we are looking
02:14 - pretty good right now even though we
02:16 - lost those zerglings and a couple voies
02:18 - earlier on and now here's a sign to my
02:20 - teammate you want to push out and he
02:22 - says yes of course he wants to see some
02:24 - action so we are going to be uh ready
02:26 - soon making sure that my expansion has
02:29 - enough robes queued up to keep them busy
02:31 - for a while so let me group this
02:32 - Colossus and now you're about to see
02:35 - probably the biggest battle of the game
02:38 - so there is their forces ready to be
02:41 - destroyed and here's our forces moving
02:43 - in uh seeing what they got and now here
02:46 - is coming off of the ramp not the best
02:47 - idea probably want to stay on higher
02:49 - ground but anyways you you see my cles
02:52 - slicing through all them they are all
02:54 - grouped together which is just terrible
02:55 - for them you don't want to be grouped
02:57 - together whenever you face Colossus and
02:59 - now the the second wave comes in of the
03:01 - dark blue team and now again all grouped
03:04 - together just Marines Marauders those
03:06 - Colossus and morles are just destroying
03:09 - them and they really never even had a
03:11 - chance so there you go in about 10
03:13 - seconds all of their armies just got
03:16 - wiped out just like that and you see
03:18 - that all of our armies are still very
03:21 - much attacked and now it's pretty much
03:23 - just destroy buildings they do however
03:25 - have some of those Siege things which
03:27 - are not that great against Immortals
03:30 - since um Immortals can't take any more
03:32 - than 10 damage usually but those
03:34 - Colossus are just they just our army is
03:37 - just the sheer size of it is too much
03:39 - for any Siege thing to handle so as you
03:41 - can see it's now pretty much destroy
03:43 - buildings and check this out while we
03:46 - were doing all that Dom was building a
03:48 - massive amount of void Ray so he's ready
03:50 - to go in and we're just keeping these
03:53 - people busy and slicing through all of
03:55 - their slide Depot slide Depot what the
03:58 - heck is a slide Depot so Supply Depot
04:00 - refineries pretty much taking out this
04:02 - entire base while Dom moves into top
04:04 - base with all his voas and now you see
04:08 - he built up a bunch of zerglings and
04:10 - banelings as well so he probably wants
04:12 - to move those in first to take out any
04:14 - of the uh ground units that might be
04:16 - harmful to void so let's see if Dom does
04:19 - that and oh my look at this they have
04:21 - five gateways two Stargates this guy had
04:23 - quite the base but it's about to get all
04:25 - wiped out right now so let's go ahead
04:27 - and see Doms is waiting there um maybe
04:30 - he's waiting for some more void Ray or
04:32 - waiting for a Zergling push but um looks
04:35 - like dark blue is trying to fly their
04:37 - Command Center over but oh it is not
04:40 - going to be enough uh let's see those
04:42 - bailing just going up the blow up all
04:44 - those TI One units in those buildings
04:46 - and those zerglings are just going to
04:48 - pick off pretty much all the ground
04:50 - forces right there in those buildings
04:51 - and Dom should move in his roider is
04:54 - from behind right now try to pick off
04:55 - that Nexus and here he comes as you can
04:57 - see these probes those probes never even
04:59 - stood a chance this Nexus is going to
05:01 - get destroyed those void rays are going
05:03 - to be all charged up and uh let's take a
05:05 - look at these voids as you see you got
05:08 - some Helens which can't even attack air
05:10 - and those stalkers but and he got one
05:13 - Thor which is good for him but these
05:14 - voides are fully charged and there's
05:16 - about 8,000 of them look how quick this
05:18 - uh Thor is going to disappear yeah in
05:21 - about 3 seconds so that uh just
05:24 - discourages them and as you can see they
05:26 - all leave the game they are depressed
05:28 - they're probably going to go up uh I
05:30 - don't even want to say but they're
05:31 - probably going to go cry themselves to
05:33 - sleep tonight so there you have it there
05:35 - is my first Starcraft thanks to Domin
05:38 - his avoid race and also my teammate with
05:40 - his massive Marauder so anyways there
05:42 - you guys have it I know I made a bunch
05:44 - of mistakes so if you guys can see
05:46 - anything that I can improve on please
