00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:06 - and in this tutorial we're going to be
00:08 - talking about initializing a raise with
00:10 - values now if you remember from the
00:13 - previous tutorials we created an array
00:16 - called string classes and then when we
00:18 - went through and we assigned a value to
00:21 - each one of those we assigned a ya value
00:27 - to each one of the indexes in that array
00:29 - now this could take a lot of time and
00:31 - there's an easier way to do this by
00:33 - adding those values to the array when
00:37 - you initialize the array so we'll go
00:39 - ahead and open up our arrays project I'm
00:43 - go ahead and zoom in some and we will
00:47 - find string classes right here okay so
00:52 - now what we're going to do is we're
00:53 - going to come down here and find form
00:56 - one load and you can see under form one
00:58 - load it takes all of our indexes and
01:02 - string classes and it sets a value to
01:04 - them now we don't need this we can go
01:07 - ahead and assign it so that when the
01:11 - program is built it's automatically that
01:15 - all of the strings in the indexes of
01:22 - string classes I already have a value
01:24 - and they aren't set at for one load they
01:26 - are just there so we'll go ahead and to
01:30 - assign values you set you declare your
01:33 - array as string or int or whatever you
01:36 - want and then you add two curly braces
01:38 - and now you're going to have to since
01:42 - we're using a string we'll go ahead and
01:43 - type web design for the first index
01:48 - which is going to be zero and now to set
01:52 - the value for the second index what
01:53 - you're going to do is you're going to
01:54 - add a comma so then we'll type Spanish
01:59 - chemistry
02:03 - English history and calculus so now we
02:14 - have all six of the items in string
02:19 - classes set to a value now when we set
02:22 - the values for this we're no longer
02:24 - going to need the number under string
02:27 - classes which is it's going to give us
02:29 - an error so if we take out five it's
02:31 - going to see that we assign this and
02:33 - when we assign it it's going to say
02:36 - we're going to use zero one two three
02:38 - four five which is six items and it's
02:41 - going to automatically know that instead
02:42 - of having to look at what we specify
02:45 - right there so if we run this we should
02:51 - get the same results as last time we can
02:55 - do whatever we want and it'll still work
03:00 - now we can also do this with integers so
03:04 - we'll just go ahead and type private
03:06 - string or int let's just do my numbers
03:13 - as integer and we'll go ahead and assign
03:18 - each value in there so we'll just do one
03:21 - two three four five and six so instead
03:30 - of using string classes in here we can
03:32 - go ahead and type my numbers
03:41 - so this should make it a little bit
03:43 - easier if you guys to see what's going
03:45 - on and looks like we're getting an error
03:53 - here so instead of string for our add
03:56 - items to list let's go ahead and make
03:58 - another add items and we will use
04:00 - coercion so private
04:04 - sub add items to list and we're going to
04:10 - use our Garre as integer so instead of
04:15 - string we will just do integer and we
04:20 - will copy this right here so now we have
04:24 - two copies of add items to list and we
04:27 - can pass an array as a string or an
04:29 - array as an integer and it will still
04:31 - work so we'll go ahead and minimize that
04:33 - and if you don't know what coercion is
04:34 - then you might want to go back and view
04:36 - that in one of my earlier tutorials so
04:39 - let's go ahead and do my numbers right
04:43 - there my numbers and we'll go up here
04:48 - and get this one that we missed and
04:51 - we'll go ahead and delete all this right
04:54 - here because we don't need it and now
04:57 - let's go ahead and run our program so
05:01 - you can see here that we can go ahead
05:03 - and click add array elements and we get
05:05 - one two three four five six and now if
05:07 - we click sort it right it's not going to
05:09 - change anything and if we click reverse
05:12 - array we get six five four three two one
05:14 - and if we click sort array what it's
05:18 - going to do is since this is of type
05:20 - integer it's going to sort it in
05:22 - numerical order now when we use string
05:25 - or character it's going to sort it in
05:27 - alphabetical order so we can reverse
05:29 - that and click sort and it will set it
05:32 - back in numerical order so go ahead and
05:38 - you can create this program that we've
05:41 - just made and add the step that I added
05:43 - here's a look at our add items to list
05:46 - you can pause it right there if you
05:47 - don't know what's in there and then go
05:51 - ahead and make some arrays initialize
05:53 - them with value
05:54 - is already make them of other types
05:57 - besides string and integer so you so you
05:59 - can get some more practice with them and
06:00 - once you got that down and you're not
06:02 - going to forget it go ahead and move on
06:04 - to the next tutorial and thanks for
06:05 - watching
