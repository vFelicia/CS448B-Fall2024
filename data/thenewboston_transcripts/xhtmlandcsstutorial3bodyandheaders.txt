00:00 - what's going on guys it is Bucky and
00:02 - welcome back to your third xhtml
00:05 - tutorial so in the last tutorial what we
00:08 - did is we made a very very basic website
00:11 - this website right here and it doesn't
00:13 - even have anything in the body all it
00:15 - has is a dumbo title that says this is a
00:17 - title sucker first of all I don't
00:20 - appreciate that attitude website and
00:22 - second of all we need to Spruce this
00:24 - website up a little bit and we need to
00:26 - actually add something I mean how dumb
00:29 - is this website it's just a white screen
00:30 - pretty dumb huh so anyways like I said a
00:33 - couple tutorials ago if you remember a
00:36 - website consists of two parts all
00:38 - websites the head which is pretty much
00:41 - all the information that you don't see
00:43 - but the browser needs such as the title
00:46 - keywords for search engines all that
00:48 - good stuff and the body now we didn't
00:50 - even add a body yet but the body is the
00:53 - part where all the images all the links
00:55 - all the paragraphs all that stuff so
00:58 - let's go ahead and build a body right
01:00 - now so we can actually have something to
01:02 - look at other than just a blank white
01:05 - nothing so anyways in order to create
01:08 - the body of your website here's what you
01:09 - need to do outside of your head but
01:13 - still inside that HTML give yourself
01:16 - some space to work first of all and go
01:18 - ahead and type the body tags now in
01:21 - order to create body tags less than and
01:23 - greater than and the keyword for this is
01:25 - body and to end your body less than
01:29 - greater than
01:30 - forward slash body so oh my forward
01:34 - slash should pick up there we go body
01:36 - just like that now anything we type in
01:38 - here is going to appear in the body of
01:41 - our website so let's go ahead and type I
01:43 - am in the body and let's go ahead and
01:46 - save this and when you save it and
01:49 - refresh it it should pop up so now we
01:52 - have some text in the body that says I
01:54 - am in the body so that is how we put
01:59 - text in the body but if all we knew how
02:01 - to do was put Domo text in the body then
02:04 - you know we're not very far on our way
02:06 - to opening a web design business so we
02:09 - need to learn something else and what
02:11 - I'm going to teach you is one of the
02:12 - most basic concepts whenever you write
02:15 - articles or you make titles for your uh
02:19 - website and that is how to create a
02:22 - header now if you're saying all right
02:24 - what the heck is a header a header is
02:26 - totally different from the head it so
02:29 - don't even you know I shouldn't have
02:30 - even pointed that out because it's
02:32 - probably just kind of confus you now but
02:34 - a header is pretty much the title think
02:38 - of like the header on a newspaper that
02:40 - says like um the world is going to end
02:42 - in 2012 it's pretty much the title that
02:45 - you would put above a paragraph So let's
02:47 - go ahead and we'll keep that I'm in the
02:50 - body but above it but still in your body
02:53 - we're going to add something like I said
02:55 - called a header now let me reiterate
02:58 - this one more time a header is is
03:00 - basically a bold big title Now by
03:03 - default they come in six different sizes
03:05 - header one header 2 header three four
03:08 - five and six now header one is the
03:11 - biggest title header two is a little bit
03:14 - smaller and they keep getting smaller
03:15 - all the way down to six but anyways let
03:17 - me quit talking and go ahead and show
03:19 - you guys an example before I uh you know
03:22 - before I confuse you too much so in
03:23 - order to make a header go ahead and in
03:25 - your tags type H1 that's the key tag or
03:29 - keyword for the header now let's go
03:32 - ahead and make our ending tag and we'll
03:34 - name this H1 now anything we type in
03:37 - between here is going to be in the
03:38 - header so since a header is going to be
03:41 - like a title let's go ahead and make
03:44 - like the world ends in 2012 that's a
03:49 - good title that might be in the
03:51 - newspapers in the upcoming months so
03:53 - let's go ahead and save this and refresh
03:56 - and I'll show you guys what a header is
03:58 - you can see that it's different than the
04:01 - default text on our web page because not
04:03 - only is it bigger but it's also bolded
04:07 - as well so whenever you're making titles
04:10 - on your web pages or you just want some
04:12 - text to stand out and pop surround it
04:15 - with header tags and it's going to pop
04:17 - now let me go ahead and copy this and
04:20 - under it I'm going to contrl V uh that's
04:24 - how you paste and under it let's go
04:26 - ahead and change this line to header 2
04:29 - so so what we have in our body right
04:31 - here is we have a big header a header
04:34 - under it that's slightly smaller and we
04:37 - have just regular text so let me show
04:39 - you guys the difference between header
04:40 - one and header 2 let's go ahead and save
04:43 - this and refresh our web page and it
04:45 - says bam the world ends in 2012 this is
04:49 - header one this is header 2 and this is
04:53 - the regular plain old text that isn't
04:55 - surrounded by any tags at all so now you
04:58 - can see the difference aheer makes and
05:01 - the different sizes you get from having
05:03 - one two and they keep getting smaller
05:05 - all the way down to six so anyways that
05:08 - is how you create a basic header and
05:10 - also add basic text in your body so
05:13 - pretty simple I know but hey we need
05:16 - this uh you know a good foundation
05:18 - before we can you know start adding
05:19 - images and making cool games and stuff
05:22 - like that I mean start with the basics
05:24 - and eventually by the end of these
05:26 - tutorials we'll be a pro at designing
05:28 - websites so anyways thank you guys for
05:30 - watching don't forget to subscribe and
05:32 - I'll see you guys next tutorial
