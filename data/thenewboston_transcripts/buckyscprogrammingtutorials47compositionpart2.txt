00:00 - alright guys welcome back to your 47th
00:02 - C++ tutorial and this tutorial is just a
00:04 - continuation from the last oriole so
00:06 - what we did in the last tutorial is we
00:09 - pretty much we're working on the people
00:10 - h header file and now we're going to hop
00:13 - over to the people dot cpp to start
00:15 - actually building our functions but now
00:17 - that I think about let's go ahead and
00:19 - have hop back over to the people header
00:21 - file and aside from just the constructor
00:24 - let's go ahead and build another
00:25 - function just so we can print it out it
00:27 - will make everything a lot easier to see
00:29 - so let's go ahead and make a function
00:32 - called what was of this one called I
00:34 - want to make sure I don't name the same
00:36 - thing this one is called print date so
00:38 - we'll call this one print info I guess
00:41 - so print info so this is pretty much
00:45 - going to create our object and this is
00:47 - going to print out the information
00:48 - simple enough so now that we have this
00:52 - people class created in our constructor
00:54 - we said it was going to take two things
00:56 - every person needs two pieces of
00:58 - information a name and a birthday so
01:02 - what we need to do is we need to assign
01:06 - the name that they passed in and the
01:09 - birthday that the pass then to the
01:11 - private variables name and date of birth
01:13 - so in order to do that what we need to
01:16 - use is a member initializer list anytime
01:19 - you're working with um a class inside of
01:24 - another class you need to use a member
01:26 - initializer list so go ahead and
01:28 - remember don't put it inside your body
01:30 - right here you put it between your
01:32 - parameters in your body and again all a
01:34 - member initializer list is it's
01:36 - basically setting name equal to X and
01:40 - it's going to set the variable date of
01:45 - birth equal to Oh would we pass in Bo so
01:50 - Bo
01:51 - and also remember that you don't put a
01:53 - semicolon at the end of this it already
01:55 - knows it's done because the body will
01:57 - start so that's all we need to do for
02:00 - this right here so again we're going to
02:02 - be passing in two pieces of information
02:04 - we're going to be passing in a string
02:06 - and then a birthday object it's going to
02:09 - take that string and set it equal to
02:10 - name and it's going to tape that
02:13 - birthday object and set it equal to the
02:14 - day of birth so now this class has a
02:17 - name and now it has a birthday object
02:19 - that you can use so let's take the
02:21 - information and we can use that whenever
02:23 - we're building this other function print
02:25 - info so let's go ahead and um yeah I
02:29 - guess I don't need to do anything before
02:31 - that so let's go ahead and put void
02:33 - people print info and of course this
02:37 - print info doesn't take any information
02:38 - but it's just going to print something
02:40 - out on the screen so what it's going to
02:42 - do is see out your name variable which
02:45 - would be Bucky Roberts and then go ahead
02:48 - and write something like was born on and
02:53 - then make sure you don't end the line
02:56 - because I want all this to be on one
02:57 - line and then after this in order to
03:00 - print that date remember we have a
03:03 - function inside our birthday class that
03:05 - prints the date right here and we
03:08 - already passed in a birthday object
03:10 - inside this class so now this class has
03:13 - access to the birthday functions so we
03:17 - can go ahead and use this date of birth
03:19 - object right here that we created in
03:20 - order to use this print date function so
03:24 - let's go ahead and just write date of
03:28 - birth right there dot print date pretty
03:33 - cool huh so now whenever we print the
03:36 - info it's basically going to say Bucky
03:38 - Roberts
03:39 - excuse me Bucky Roberts was born on
03:42 - twelve 2886
03:44 - pretty cool huh so now let's go over oh
03:47 - wait a minute I almost forgot to do this
03:49 - we need to include a bunch of stuff
03:51 - inside this people class um I'll talk
03:53 - you guys through it the first thing we
03:55 - need to include is our iostream and STD
03:57 - because you know we need to include
03:59 - those basically in every class and aside
04:02 - from that we also need to include this
04:04 - birthday header right here and the
04:07 - reason we need to do that is because
04:08 - whenever basically whenever you're
04:11 - working with another class you need to
04:13 - include the header so yeah I definitely
04:16 - just messed that up accidentally
04:19 - highlighted something so one more time
04:22 - okay let's not copy and paste it or in
04:24 - spots this time all right
04:26 - so let's go ahead and in our main CPP um
04:30 - everything looks good go so far actually
04:33 - what we need to do is since we're going
04:35 - to be working with birthday objects and
04:38 - people objects in this one we need to
04:40 - include include those headers as well so
04:42 - go ahead and grab this and include it
04:46 - right there and go ahead and grab this
04:48 - and include it right there so basically
04:52 - you see whenever you're working with the
04:54 - object you need to include it simple
04:56 - enough so check this out
04:59 - since the people class in order to
05:03 - create an object you need a birthday
05:05 - object whenever we run our main we need
05:08 - to create that birthday object first so
05:11 - remember in our birthday object when we
05:14 - first created our object needs three
05:17 - pieces of information a month a day in
05:19 - the year so let's go ahead and create a
05:23 - birthday object if I spell write
05:25 - birthday and we'll just name it birth
05:28 - object and then these those three pieces
05:31 - of information a month a day and a year
05:35 - so now we have a birthday object created
05:37 - called birth object and this birthday
05:40 - object pretty much took month day and
05:43 - year and set equal to twelve 2886 so now
05:47 - we can go ahead and create a people
05:49 - object people I'm just going to name
05:51 - mine Bucky
05:53 - Roberts and you're saying all right well
05:56 - what information does the people class
05:59 - need well whenever we create a people
06:01 - object it needs a string as the name
06:04 - and it needs a birthday object right
06:07 - there
06:07 - so first let's give it a name Bucky the
06:11 - King and the second piece of information
06:14 - it needed was a birthday object well it
06:17 - just so happens that we created one up
06:19 - here so let's go ahead and pass that in
06:20 - right there so after this what we need
06:23 - to do is might as well just print out
06:26 - the info right here so remember in the
06:28 - people class we had a function called
06:30 - print info and it just printed out the
06:32 - name and the birthday so go ahead and
06:35 - type your object named Bucky Roberts dot
06:38 - print info and remember it doesn't take
06:40 - any parameters and let's run this and
06:42 - see how many errors I got one so hold on
06:45 - once and I see what's going on all right
06:48 - see this up whenever we create this
06:50 - constructor we forgot to pass it in the
06:53 - parameters so just go ahead and copy
06:56 - these parameters copy and paste so
06:59 - hopefully that's the only errors we got
07:01 - and it looks good go so Bucky the King
07:05 - was born on 12 28 1986 works awesome so
07:10 - let me talk you guys through one last
07:11 - time what we did we just created a basic
07:14 - birthday class and this birthday class
07:17 - had three variables a month a day in a
07:19 - year so whenever we created a birthday
07:21 - object it took that month day in a year
07:25 - and assigned it to the three birthday
07:27 - variables month day in a year so we got
07:30 - the birthday class taken care of and
07:32 - then we decided to build another people
07:34 - class now the people class whenever you
07:37 - built a person and need the two pieces
07:39 - of information and needed a string which
07:42 - we gave it Bucky the King and it needed
07:45 - a birthday object so when for example
07:48 - whenever we had a birthday object right
07:50 - here we could pass it in second and what
07:53 - it did is in the main program it took
07:55 - that name and set it equal to the
07:57 - variable name and it took the birthday
08:00 - object and set it equal to the object
08:02 - date of birth
08:04 - so that basically gave us access to the
08:07 - birthday class so from there we were
08:09 - able to use data birth and the function
08:11 - in the birthday class
08:13 - to print out the birthday so basically
08:17 - whenever I run this this is a function
08:19 - from the people class and this is
08:22 - actually a function from the birthday
08:24 - class we just tied them together in one
08:27 - function right here pretty cool so that
08:30 - is basically what our composition is
08:33 - compositions basically using other
08:36 - classes inside your class using objects
08:39 - of other classes inside your class um
08:41 - that's all I'm going to go over for
08:43 - composition now hopefully you guys
08:45 - understand if you don't definitely go
08:47 - check out my forum and just type in
08:50 - whatever question you have and a ton of
08:52 - people are willing to help you but for
08:54 - now that's all I have for you guys
08:55 - this is a pretty long tutorial so go
08:57 - take a break go grab a milkshake or some
08:59 - and when you're done you're ready to
09:01 - move on to the next tutorial so thank
