00:01 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:04 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to be working
00:07 - more on the truck class and then we're
00:10 - going to start building the interface
00:12 - for our program and adding more to it so
00:15 - let's go ahead and um add one more thing
00:18 - that we're going to be that we're going
00:19 - to need for our truck class
00:22 - so we'll just add a function that gives
00:25 - the information about the
00:28 - truck so
00:30 - let's come up here to our car class and
00:33 - let's find the two string function that
00:35 - has been
00:37 - overridden so you can see here we've got
00:40 - uh name color uh number of doors and
00:45 - speed so we'll go ahead and copy that
00:47 - because we're going to use that as the
00:49 - base for
00:51 - our uh get information now you may be
00:54 - thinking we could just use the two
00:56 - string and then add stuff to that well
00:58 - we're going to be adding stuff in
00:59 - between those values so that won't be
01:01 - very practical so we'll type public
01:06 - function get truck
01:09 - info as string so it's going to be
01:12 - returning a string so we're just going
01:15 - to return the name the color the number
01:18 - of doors and in between here let's go
01:20 - ahead and add uh the cab
01:25 - size
01:27 - so and then we will add
01:30 - um
01:33 - truck cab
01:37 - length so then we'll add the uh bed
01:41 - length so we'll just type bed
01:46 - length and then we will add um the
01:49 - length value
01:51 - so truck bed
01:54 - length and now we will add uh just the
01:57 - number of
01:58 - doors so we're going to need a new line
02:01 - in between each one of these so
02:04 - environment. new
02:07 - line and then we'll add this string
02:10 - right here and then one more new line uh
02:17 - right here so
02:21 - environment. new
02:24 - line okay so now that we have everything
02:28 - we need for the truck class let's go
02:30 - ahead and minimize that and you can see
02:32 - that I've organized all the code in here
02:34 - we got the car super class now the super
02:36 - class is the main class that all of
02:39 - these inherit from sports car truck and
02:41 - then our two
02:43 - enumerations so we'll come back here uh
02:45 - into form one.
02:47 - VB we'll zoom in some so let's go ahead
02:51 - and go to the designer and we'll just
02:54 - add a list box that will hold all of our
02:59 - um car or truck or sports car objects so
03:03 - this box right
03:05 - here we'll make it a little bit
03:07 - bigger and we'll um shrink it we'll
03:11 - bring it down like that now let's go
03:13 - ahead and bring it down a little bit
03:14 - more and we're going to add another
03:18 - button so we'll come back to our
03:21 - toolbox we'll click button or we'll add
03:25 - button one and we'll set the text to new
03:29 - car
03:32 - and then we'll set the name to button
03:35 - create C now we're not going to be using
03:37 - that right now uh but we will um later
03:41 - on so we'll come back to form one. VB
03:43 - and now what we're going to need is a an
03:47 - array list that's going to hold all of
03:48 - our car objects now we going to use an
03:51 - array list because we don't know how
03:52 - many objects the user is going to be
03:53 - adding to the list
03:55 - box so we will type private
04:00 - um cars as new array
04:05 - list okay so whenever our form loads
04:09 - let's just go ahead and
04:11 - um add these two objects right here to
04:15 - our array list so we'll just type cars.
04:21 - add and the will then we'll add default
04:26 - car and we will add
04:30 - the default sports
04:36 - car okay so now that we have these two
04:38 - cars in our array list let's go ahead
04:41 - and um add all those items to our form
04:46 - one or to our list box now let's go
04:48 - ahead and rename the list box right here
04:51 - so we'll just call it list cars and
04:54 - we'll come back in
04:56 - here and we'll create a sub that will do
05:00 - this for
05:02 - us so we we will type private
05:06 - sub add all
05:10 - cars and this is just going to run once
05:13 - um when the form one loads so what we're
05:16 - going to do is add all cars so we'll
05:18 - type for
05:21 - each car as and then we want to do it of
05:27 - type we'll do it of type all cars .
05:35 - car so you can see that we can use
05:38 - polymorphism in this
05:42 - um in this uh for each Loop right here
05:45 - because we can pass a car object we can
05:48 - use car objects in this but um we can
05:51 - also use sports cars and
05:53 - trucks so hold on let's typ this again
05:56 - um
06:03 - in so our array list that we're going to
06:06 - use for this is cars so for each car as
06:09 - all cars. car in Cars that might be a
06:12 - little confusing but we're just going to
06:14 - go ahead and add that to the uh list box
06:18 - right here now as I was saying we're
06:21 - going to use polymorphism for this
06:23 - because we can treat sports cars and
06:25 - trucks as a car because they inherit
06:27 - from it um so we don't have to do a
06:30 - specific type in here so we'll just type
06:33 - list cars. items.
06:36 - add and then we're just going to add car
06:40 - dot car name so this is going to add our
06:45 - car name to the list
06:47 - box so let's go ahead and run
06:50 - this and looks like we're getting an
06:52 - error
06:54 - here so we' got in speed is not
06:58 - accessible
07:01 - so we're just going to have to make that
07:05 - uh let's see
07:07 - here we're going to have to use this
07:10 - property right
07:12 - here so we can just go
07:14 - ahead and instead of typing in speed
07:18 - we'll just type speed
07:31 - so we're accessing the speed property
07:33 - and not the variable itself okay so now
07:36 - let's run this again and see if we get
07:37 - the desired
07:41 - output um looks like we're going to have
07:43 - to call that sub so we'll just type add
07:47 - all
07:49 - cars okay so now it should
07:56 - work but before it we'll be able to
07:59 - print out uh the car name of our default
08:01 - car and our default sports car we're
08:04 - going to have to actually set the name
08:05 - or it's going to be printing out a uh
08:08 - null object inside of our list box and
08:10 - you won't actually see it so we'll set
08:12 - the first one
08:14 - to uh we'll do a Honda
08:18 - CRV and then for the sports
08:26 - car we will just call it uh Mustang
08:30 - GT so Mustang GT right there okay so now
08:36 - if everything runs right hopefully we
08:38 - get each car um
08:41 - inside of our list
08:43 - box now we can actually um show the
08:48 - information of each one of these
08:50 - different cars but we'll be doing that
08:52 - in the next tutorial as you can see if I
08:53 - select CRV it gives us the Mustang GT
08:56 - info and that's not exactly what we want
08:59 - so go ahead put this code in if you
09:01 - haven't already and then once you've
09:03 - done that go ahead and move on to the
09:04 - next tutorial
