00:00 - so now we need to come down and create a
00:02 - watermark height and also a watermark
00:08 - width value and we can easily do this
00:12 - using the image SX function so it will
00:15 - type image SX and here we just need to
00:19 - supply one argument and that's just the
00:22 - image we've already loaded in so we've
00:25 - got the watermark height so the image
00:27 - watermark hi using this function and
00:29 - just supplying the already opened image
00:31 - so we'll do exactly the same thing for
00:34 - the width as well okay so now we've
00:39 - successfully loaded in the watermark and
00:41 - the watermark height and width from this
00:43 - watermark that we've already created
00:45 - we've basically here created a new image
00:48 - file in Gd but from this so we've almost
00:51 - duplicated the file if you like okay so
00:55 - the next thing to do is set up our
00:57 - canvas now we need to set up our canvas
01:02 - by basically using our image to create
01:05 - true color function and that's going to
01:07 - go inside an image and image a variable
01:12 - called image sorry so the function we
01:14 - need to use is image create true color
01:18 - and we need to supply this with two
01:22 - values and that is going to be watermark
01:27 - height in fact where it's the width
01:32 - first so we're always taking a whip
01:33 - first and water mark height now we're
01:38 - going to redefine the same variable and
01:40 - we're going to say image create from
01:43 - JPEG so this is the important part we're
01:47 - creating the image from our source so
01:51 - remember up here we called our value
01:53 - source or the value that we're reading
01:55 - in source so we can just pop in source
01:57 - there so you can see now why I created
01:59 - this variable it's a lot easier than
02:01 - then keep referencing this long if you
02:04 - like get method way of reading in a
02:06 - value so now what we need to do is get
02:09 - the image size so by image size I mean
02:12 - the image as in the
02:13 - phone image that I showed you earlier
02:15 - this is the size of the source image
02:17 - that we're loading in using this line
02:19 - here so what we want to do is we want to
02:22 - create a new variable so we'll name it
02:24 - properly we'll call it image underscore
02:26 - size and we're going to be using a
02:28 - function called get image size
02:31 - now get image size isn't actually a GD
02:35 - function itself this can be used without
02:36 - Gd so if you find that you might need
02:39 - this function elsewhere and you might
02:42 - need to use this function and you don't
02:44 - have Gd installed you're more than
02:46 - welcome to use this as it's not part of
02:48 - the GD library so obviously we're
02:50 - getting the image file from the image
02:52 - size sorry from the source like I said
02:54 - earlier so we just supply it with the
02:56 - argument source which is the source data
02:58 - we're reading in now you'll notice just
03:00 - just to make know that we use in the
03:02 - image SX function here and here to grab
03:04 - the watermark height and width however
03:06 - why are we using this get image function
03:08 - here the reason we'll get image size
03:11 - function here the reason we're using
03:13 - this down here as opposed to the image
03:15 - SX is we haven't loaded in the source
03:19 - well we have but what we want to do is
03:22 - we want to read the get image size from
03:25 - the source which is the file that we're
03:28 - supplying with so we're using this and
03:29 - without loading the image in first and
03:33 - as we've done here create image from
03:35 - pier we've used this function here but
03:38 - here we're just using the get image size
03:39 - and this is going to read it in as an
03:41 - array so now what we can do is we can
03:44 - set two variables that's x and y now
03:48 - these two variables are going to be the
03:50 - positioning for they're going to be the
03:54 - positioning for our water map now
03:58 - remember I said that we're going to have
03:59 - it 10 pixels from the bottom and 10
04:05 - pixels from the side so we need to take
04:07 - this into account when we're - in values
04:09 - because let's say my text editor at the
04:12 - moment was an image the top here would
04:16 - be at 0 and then we'd go all the way
04:18 - down here positively and all the way
04:20 - down here positively so what we want to
04:22 - do is we want to start here and minus 10
04:25 - and minus 10 so we can end up around
04:27 - here then we can display our watermark
04:29 - here so let's change this X variable and
04:33 - like I said image size is read in as a
04:36 - array and the first element of the array
04:39 - so element 0 let's just type it out so
04:42 - you can see what we're doing is equal to
04:46 - the width of the image so the first one
04:49 - which is 0 is is equal to the image
04:51 - width so now what we can do is say the
04:55 - image width overall minus the watermark
04:59 - width remember we got the watermark
05:02 - height and width over here earlier I've
05:08 - just noticed that the I've supplied the
05:12 - wrong function in here image sy is for
05:15 - height and image SX is for the width so
05:20 - let's just change these around so
05:22 - they're in order as we're supplying them
05:25 - so yeah sorry about that if you go back
05:27 - if you're following this tutorial as it
05:28 - is we've got image as X and whites we've
05:30 - got X and wife the width and the height
05:32 - so the watermark width is now going to
05:35 - be minus 10 but like I said I want it 10
05:37 - pixels away width wise now height wise I
05:41 - want it 10 pixels away as well but this
05:43 - time for the image size which is now an
05:47 - array we want that to 1 because that's
05:50 - going to represent the height so one is
05:52 - representing the height so let's do
05:56 - exactly the same we're using exactly the
05:57 - same structure we want to say watermark
05:59 - height minus 10 okay so let's just recap
06:03 - on what we've done we've loaded the
06:05 - image in as a filename we've created the
06:09 - logo which is the watermark evidently
06:13 - we've created that in from a PNG files
06:16 - we're using a PNG file we've grabbed the
06:18 - width and the height of the watermark so
06:20 - we can do things with it down here we've
06:22 - created an image and loaded in our image
06:27 - that we've created from our JPEG so
06:28 - we've image crate from JPEG source which
06:31 - is the file name that we've loaded
06:32 - and we've grabbed the image size and
06:34 - we've created the X&Y position for the
06:36 - watermark which is ten pixels away from
06:39 - the edge of the image okay so the next
06:45 - thing to do is to use the image copy
06:48 - merge function now this has got lots of
06:51 - parameters that we're going to throw at
06:53 - it some of which we need to discuss some
06:56 - of which we probably don't but I'm going
06:58 - to try and go through all of them so the
07:00 - image copy merge function looks like
07:02 - this now what is this function going to
07:05 - do this function is responsible for
07:06 - taking one image and basically merging
07:11 - it with another image and we're going to
07:13 - say we're going to well give give the
07:16 - parameters to this function of how we
07:17 - want to merge and by merging we're doing
07:20 - exactly the same thing as applying a
07:22 - watermark onto our image
