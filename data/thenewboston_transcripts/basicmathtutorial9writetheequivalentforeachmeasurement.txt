00:01 - the directions say write the equivalent
00:03 - for each
00:04 - measurement well when you say equivalent
00:06 - you mean what does two feet in inches so
00:10 - we're basically converting yards or feet
00:13 - into inches so here we go we have 2 feet
00:16 - here
00:18 - and we know that 1 foot equals 12
00:21 - in so you just
00:24 - add 12 and 12 together 2 and 2 is 4 1
00:29 - and one is two so that's easy enough 24
00:33 - in so we have 5 and 1/2 ft so we're
00:36 - going to have to take five of those 12 1
00:39 - 2 3 4 five and then a half of foot we
00:44 - know is half of 12 which is six adding
00:48 - six so 2 4 6 8 10 + 6 is
00:53 - 16 7 8 1 2 3 4 5
00:58 - 6 so we know that is 66
01:02 - in now we're get into 3T and 7 in well
01:06 - 3T is just 12 * 3 so we
01:13 - have 12 12 12 12
01:19 - 12 oh let's actually subtract some of
01:23 - these
01:25 - twelves okay 3 feet so 3 12 plus 7 in so
01:31 - 2 4 6 6 and 7 is
01:38 - 13 and we have 1 2 3
01:41 - 4 that's 43
01:47 - in now 1 and 1/3 yard so we know that
01:50 - one yard is 36 in that's easy enough so
01:54 - we take the 36
01:57 - in and we add 1/3 yards it's pretty easy
02:00 - because a whole yard imagine a whole
02:03 - yard divided into three parts and each
02:07 - of these parts is one foot so and each
02:10 - of these foot is 12
02:14 - in so that's easy enough so we take one
02:17 - yard which is 36 and then 1/3 only one
02:22 - of these so that is 12
02:25 - in 6 7 8 3 and + 1 is 4 that's 48
02:33 - in so you have 6
02:35 - fet simple enough we have 12 12 12 12 12
02:42 - 12 using addition only 3 4 6 8 10 12
02:48 - carry the one bring down the two 1 2 3 4
02:51 - 5 6 7 that is 72
02:56 - in so now we have 2 yards 1T and 3 in
03:00 - so we know T yards one yard is 36 so
03:04 - let's put down two of them 36 and 36 one
03:08 - foot we know is 12
03:10 - in and 3
03:14 - in using only addition 6 and 6 is 12 13
03:18 - 14 15 16 17 carry the one bring down the
03:21 - seven 3 and 3 is 6 78 and that would be
03:24 - 87
03:27 - in there you go that's how you convert
03:29 - from yards to feet to inches
