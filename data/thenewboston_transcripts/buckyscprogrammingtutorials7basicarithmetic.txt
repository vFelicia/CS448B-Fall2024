00:00 - all righty guys welcome back to your
00:02 - seventh C++ tutorial and in this
00:04 - tutorial as promised I'm going to be
00:06 - going over basic C++ arithmetic now I
00:10 - don't know I think it was like tutorials
00:12 - go I gave you guys a variable and I
00:14 - showed you guys that instead of just
00:16 - setting it equal to a plain old value
00:18 - like this you can use basic arithmetic
00:20 - like 4 plus 6 and then when you go ahead
00:24 - and you print it out X or anything like
00:26 - that it actually calculated the value
00:29 - and printed out the answer so go ahead
00:31 - and run this and you see that X now
00:33 - equals 10 4 plus 6
00:35 - so aside from addition I want to show
00:38 - you guys all the arithmetic operators
00:40 - that you can use and they're a little
00:42 - bit different than you might expect so
00:43 - let's start with the easy ones first
00:45 - the first one is subtraction and of
00:47 - course like 8 minus 4 this would be
00:50 - valid if we go ahead and build this we
00:52 - saw that the answer would be 4 so
00:54 - addition subtraction easy enough but
00:57 - also aside from addition subtraction you
00:59 - can use multiplication but make sure not
01:01 - to use X like that because that will
01:03 - mess up in order to multiply in computer
01:06 - programming use the asterisks and that's
01:08 - the symbol above the eight on your
01:09 - keyboard and what this is going to do is
01:12 - multiply these two numbers eight times
01:13 - four so now if you go ahead and run this
01:15 - we should get 32 and check it out 32
01:18 - just like that so the well let's go
01:22 - ahead and before I go over this let's go
01:24 - ahead and go over division in order to
01:28 - use the vision in computer programming
01:30 - let's go ahead and take 81 divided by 3
01:33 - division the symbol for this is the
01:36 - forward slash so let's go ahead and take
01:39 - 81 divided by 3 and we get 27 just like
01:43 - that
01:43 - simple enough but check this out what if
01:46 - we have something like 81 divided by 2
01:49 - well this I mean it should be 40 but it
01:53 - has a remainder of 1
01:54 - so let's go ahead and try to build and
01:56 - run this and see what we get well it
01:59 - just has 40 and that's not entirely
02:01 - right because it should have a remainder
02:04 - of 1 with it so we're saying all right
02:06 - we're working with integers right here
02:08 - and we
02:09 - any other data types so how can we get
02:11 - that remainder well whenever we want to
02:14 - use the remainder we need to use
02:16 - something called the modulus operator
02:17 - and that is the percent sign like this
02:20 - what this is going to do is it's going
02:22 - to give you the remainder of the answer
02:24 - it's not going to say 40 remainder one
02:26 - it's just going to give you that one so
02:29 - let's go ahead and build and run this
02:30 - and you can see that whenever we do 81
02:34 - modulus 2 it's going to give us the
02:36 - remainder which is 1 so let me show you
02:38 - guys a better example on maybe 24 modulo
02:42 - 7 well we know that 21 or excuse me 24/7
02:47 - is 3 with a reminder where the remainder
02:50 - of 3 so let's go ahead and build this in
02:52 - again it doesn't say 3 remainder 3 it
02:55 - just says the remainder which is 3
02:57 - simple enough so now that we know all
03:01 - the arithmetic operators I can begin
03:04 - teaching guys about order of precedence
03:06 - now aside from just you know one number
03:09 - of rithmetic operator another number you
03:13 - can have complex calculations like 6
03:15 - times 4 plus 8 times 4 plus 9 divided by
03:22 - 20 and if we go ahead and build and run
03:25 - this let's see what we get
03:26 - 56 birthday in our a so what order is
03:31 - just doing this in is it doing 6 times 4
03:33 - and then plus 8 or is it doing you know
03:36 - 4 plus 8 and then times that by 6
03:39 - because depending on how you do it it's
03:42 - going to come out with a different
03:43 - result so the basics is this if you
03:47 - remember way back in like seventh grade
03:49 - math you know something called your
03:52 - associative property and that's pretty
03:54 - much this anything that's in parentheses
03:59 - gets done first if you don't have any
04:02 - parentheses it goes like this it does
04:05 - all the multiplication in the vision
04:07 - which would be this this and this it's
04:11 - going to do that first and then it's
04:13 - going to do you're dissin addition and
04:15 - subtraction if you don't have if you
04:19 - know if you just have like four plus
04:21 - eight plus seven um you're saying all
04:24 - right then is it going to do a plus
04:26 - seven first or four plus eight first it
04:28 - really doesn't matter it comes out the
04:29 - same either way the only time you have
04:32 - varying answers is when you have like
04:35 - four plus three times seven for example
04:41 - if you did four plus three it would be 7
04:44 - times 7 would be 49 but whenever we run
04:48 - this whoa easy box we get 25 why is that
04:52 - because it uses the associative property
04:54 - it actually multiplies first which is 7
04:57 - times 3 and that's 21 plus 4 which is 25
05:01 - so again if you want to explicitly say 4
05:05 - plus 3 first you need to surround that
05:07 - in parentheses so now whenever we build
05:10 - and run this it's going to run your
05:11 - parentheses first and say our a 4 plus 3
05:14 - equals 7 times 7 equals 49 so remember
05:18 - the rule is this parentheses first then
05:21 - your multiplication in the vision and
05:23 - then your addition and subtraction so
05:26 - remember that and if you get confused
05:28 - it's called the associative property you
05:31 - should have learned it in like eighth
05:32 - grade math or ninth grade math or maybe
05:34 - 7th grade I don't know I can't remember
05:35 - it was a long time ago for now that's
05:38 - all I want to talk to you guys about
05:39 - basic arithmetic and how it works in C++
05:43 - so for now that's all you guys get so
