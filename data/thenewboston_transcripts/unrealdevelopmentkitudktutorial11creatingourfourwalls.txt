00:00 - all right guys welcome to your 11th udk
00:02 - tutorial and in this tutorial now that
00:05 - we got our floor built it's time to
00:06 - start putting up some walls so what I'm
00:09 - going to do is first of all I'm going to
00:11 - Envision that we're building a little
00:13 - house here and instead of putting up
00:15 - four walls that cover the entire length
00:18 - and the entire width of this house I'm
00:20 - going to leave some space in front for
00:22 - you know a front deck or front porch
00:24 - whatever you want to call it so I'm not
00:26 - going to be just enclosing this totally
00:28 - I'm going to be leaving some space for a
00:30 - porch I think that'll make things a
00:32 - little more interesting so let's go
00:34 - ahead and the first thing I want to do
00:35 - is let's go ahead and build these short
00:38 - walls right here as you know we got a
00:40 - short length and a long length or AKA
00:43 - width and length so I'm going to be
00:45 - taking care of those shorter walls first
00:47 - so go ahead and we first want to make
00:50 - sure that we first want to check the
00:52 - properties of our floor to make sure the
00:55 - dimensions on what we should build are
00:56 - short wall so we already know the width
00:59 - of this is 1024 and that's this right
01:02 - here the X so we can go ahead and leave
01:05 - that right there we already know that
01:08 - the length of
01:09 - it is let's see what it is 1280 and
01:13 - check it out since we're building a
01:14 - short wall we only want to have the
01:16 - length be like 32 so let's go ahead and
01:18 - change this to 32 and now for z z is the
01:22 - height now we can pick anything we want
01:24 - for height I'm going to make my walls
01:26 - let's just say 576 tall so let's go
01:30 - ahead and if we build this an X out of
01:32 - it we can see that this is a pretty good
01:34 - height so we could go ahead and position
01:37 - this wall in this perspective view right
01:39 - here but as you can see it's kind of
01:41 - confusing so it would probably be better
01:43 - to do this go ahead and in your front
01:46 - view go ahead and drag this up until
01:49 - your wall sits exactly on the base of
01:51 - your floor that's probably the easiest
01:53 - either using this side view in the top
01:55 - left or front view where you can
01:57 - position your wall another thing you
01:59 - want want to do is you want to slide it
02:01 - all the way back to your very back
02:04 - corner and probably if we scroll in here
02:07 - let me just drag up a little bit we can
02:09 - position this wall exactly on the very
02:11 - back Edge so that way you can see that
02:14 - these graph views as I like to come them
02:17 - they aren't totally useless I know they
02:19 - don't look really pretty but whenever
02:21 - we're doing Precision movement they
02:23 - actually come in handy so with that
02:25 - being said my wall looks good in all my
02:28 - angles let me verify this top view front
02:30 - view side view and perspective view it
02:32 - looks pretty good so I'm going to go
02:34 - ahead and hit CSG add and add my wall
02:37 - right there now let me go ahead and show
02:40 - you guys a little trick in order to
02:43 - build another wall let me go ahead and
02:46 - actually maybe I'll change the angle of
02:49 - this a little bit right there might look
02:50 - good in order to build another wall we
02:53 - basically need an exact duplicate of
02:56 - this so what we can do is we can take
02:58 - this red Builder brush and we can can
02:59 - move it and we can build it again but I
03:02 - want to teach you guys a little trick in
03:04 - order to make an exact copy of a shape
03:06 - you already have go ahead and select
03:08 - that shape and now if you go ahead and
03:11 - hold alt on your keyboard and go ahead
03:14 - and drag it forward we can get an exact
03:17 - copy of that shape so let me go ahead
03:20 - and hit release there and that actually
03:23 - looks pretty good right there I actually
03:24 - want to drag it back just a bit let's
03:28 - see I probably want to drag it back
03:30 - I don't
03:31 - know maybe right there and actually I
03:34 - hit all again so let's go ahead and drag
03:37 - that back right there and I think it
03:39 - looks pretty good right there I want to
03:40 - get it lined up perfectly so this gives
03:43 - us enough space for a porch right here
03:46 - and also gives us a nice space for the
03:48 - inside right here so you're saying all
03:50 - right Bucky so what you did is you dragg
03:53 - that wall but we're not having a
03:56 - duplicate wall so the reason behind that
03:58 - is because remember in a couple
04:00 - tutorials ago I told you guys anytime
04:03 - you update your geometry you have to
04:05 - rebuild it so go ahead and build
04:07 - geometry for Visible level and close
04:09 - that and whenever we do that we see we
04:11 - indeed get a wall pretty cool huh so now
04:15 - let me tell you guys another little
04:17 - trick so before what we needed to do is
04:21 - we needed to
04:22 - calculate how big how tall we pretty
04:25 - much needed to calculate the size of the
04:27 - wall well now what we need to do is we
04:29 - we need to figure out the length between
04:31 - this wall right here and this wall right
04:33 - here so what we could do is you know
04:35 - maybe we want to go to the grid and
04:37 - count yada yada y yada maybe this grid
04:40 - will be easier to count but I want to
04:41 - show you guys a nice little shortcut in
04:44 - order to measure two distances on your
04:46 - grid what you need to do is you need to
04:49 - go ahead and select a point on your grid
04:51 - and then hold the middle Mouse button
04:54 - and this middle Mouse button is kind of
04:55 - like a tape measure go ahead and click
04:57 - it and hold it and drag it it and now
05:00 - once you start dragging it you can see
05:02 - that all right the distance between
05:04 - these two walls is 896 so that's how
05:07 - long I need to make my third wall again
05:10 - one more time anytime you want to
05:11 - measure the point between two points or
05:14 - the distance between two points rather
05:16 - hold your middle Mouse button and drag
05:18 - and it's kind of like a virtual tape
05:20 - measure 8.96 that's how big I need to
05:22 - make it and just to verify 896 divided
05:25 - by 32 that divides evenly so makes sense
05:30 - so now let's go ahead and select our red
05:31 - Builder brush and go ahead and
05:33 - rightclick it and now let's go ahead and
05:36 - change this so the length x remember if
05:39 - we scroll down here we can see that the
05:41 - length or X is going to be pretty much
05:44 - the width of the wall so we want to
05:45 - change that to 32 and now the y That's
05:48 - the length we calculated that's the
05:51 - 896 and also that that Z the Z shouldn't
05:55 - change because remember Z is height and
05:57 - again if you get confused look down here
05:59 - in in the bottom left hand corner and
06:00 - that's going to give you idea of what x
06:02 - z and y means so it's 32 thickness the
06:06 - length is 896 and the height just like
06:08 - the other wall is 576 so go ahead and
06:11 - hit build what did I say build well not
06:15 - uh not the funniest thing to say but all
06:18 - right so we can like I said position
06:21 - this in the perspective view right here
06:24 - but I'm going to go ahead and position
06:25 - mine in the top view so go ahead and
06:28 - move this over to the top view scroll in
06:30 - make sure it's positioned nicely and
06:33 - another thing I want to do is in my side
06:35 - view check it out it's not exactly
06:38 - hitting the ground so go ahead and move
06:40 - this down in our side view and if we
06:42 - look in all our views right now we can
06:44 - see that this wall is perfectly lined up
06:46 - on the side on the front on the top and
06:49 - it looks pretty dang good in our
06:50 - perspective view too so go ahead and hit
06:53 - CSG ad and it's going to add that
06:55 - geometry pretty cool huh so now let's go
06:58 - ahead and get our red build brush out of
07:00 - the way and what I want to do is go
07:03 - ahead and highlight this in our side
07:05 - view and I'm going to use that copy
07:06 - shortcut again so actually is this the
07:09 - best VI you to do so well let's go ahead
07:11 - and do this let's move our red Builder
07:14 - brush out of the way right here and
07:16 - probably the top view would be the
07:17 - easiest although you could do it in the
07:18 - side view again like I said anytime you
07:22 - want to copy this wall exactly highlight
07:24 - the wall make sure you don't have your
07:26 - red Builder brush selected make sure you
07:28 - have your wall selected in the outline
07:29 - will be blue hold down alt on your
07:32 - keyboard and go ahead and drag it until
07:35 - it ends up where you want to copy it and
07:37 - go ahead and let go so if we go ahead
07:39 - and scroll in we can verify that
07:42 - actually I messed up a little bit let's
07:44 - go ahead and drag that to it matches up
07:46 - and make sure you verify in all of your
07:49 - angles the front view the side view and
07:51 - the top view and also might as well just
07:53 - verify in the perspective view that
07:55 - looks good and once it does you're ready
07:58 - to move on so the last thing you
07:59 - probably want to do is build this so go
08:02 - ahead and build your geometry and indeed
08:05 - we get a nice looking house with four
08:09 - walls again what I'm going to be doing
08:11 - in the upcoming tutorials is I'm going
08:12 - to be adding a door in front and you
08:15 - know maybe add him some pillars for the
08:17 - porch and of course we need a roof as
08:19 - well or else it's going to rain on us so
08:22 - we have a basic shape of a house done a
08:25 - couple things you need to take away from
08:27 - this tutorial is make sure if you ever
08:29 - get confused you don't know what length
08:31 - width height is go ahead and just look
08:33 - in the bottom left and that's going to
08:35 - give you the idea of what X Y and Z is
08:37 - and also anytime you want to copy make
08:40 - sure to hold all on your keyboard and
08:42 - drag the shape that you want to copy and
08:44 - you're not going to see it at first
08:45 - until you rebuild your geometry so make
08:47 - sure your geometry is rebuilt so there
08:50 - we have the beginning of our nice little
08:52 - house it kind of looks like a Super
08:53 - Mario Brothers Top Hat you know how his
08:56 - Hat's like kind of Square anyways I'm
08:58 - just talking to myself though so thank
09:00 - you guys for watching and uh yeah I'll
09:02 - see you guys in the next video
