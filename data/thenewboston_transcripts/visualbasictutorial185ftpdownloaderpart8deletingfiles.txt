00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and in this tutorial we're going to
00:07 - continue working on our FTP downloader
00:09 - so what we're going to be talking about
00:11 - now is deleting the a file from the FTP
00:16 - server now if you want to delete upload
00:19 - and download files in all the pins on
00:22 - the permissions of the user for the
00:24 - server so let me open up my FileZilla
00:27 - server here let's see here it is so you
00:32 - can see there's a whole bunch of
00:34 - activity from me connecting to it
00:36 - through this program if I go to my users
00:38 - you see I have a tutorials and none of
00:41 - the shared folders they can read write
00:43 - delete and append so make sure if you
00:47 - have an FTP server set up on that they
00:49 - have all these permissions or if you're
00:50 - connecting to one because if they don't
00:52 - have these permissions then you won't be
00:53 - able to use this functionality so we'll
00:57 - go ahead and double click on delete and
00:59 - let's make sure that they have actually
01:02 - selected a file so if lists FTP files
01:07 - dot selected index
01:11 - does not equal negative one then we'll
01:14 - go ahead and do this now negative one is
01:16 - the index that is pretty much selected
01:19 - if nothing on their selected and then it
01:21 - starts at zero and goes down to the list
01:23 - so we'll just type FTP downloader
01:27 - dot delete or FTP delete and then for
01:35 - the file name we're going to use list
01:37 - FTP files dot selected item so you may
01:45 - have remembered when we create a
01:46 - download we didn't have this if
01:48 - statement right here so what we need to
01:50 - do is add that up here so if list FTP
01:58 - files dot selected index does not equal
02:02 - negative one then we're going ahead
02:04 - we'll go ahead and download it so we'll
02:07 - just end if right here
02:11 - and if the selected index is negative
02:15 - one then we just want to tell them so
02:18 - we're just using else I'll type message
02:20 - box show please select a file
02:29 - error and then message box buttons dot
02:32 - okay and then message box icon dot error
02:42 - okay so let's go ahead and run this and
02:45 - see what happens if they try to download
02:47 - something that isn't there it says error
02:50 - please select a file and you can hear it
02:52 - plays that error noise so we'll go ahead
02:56 - and come back down into delete and it's
02:58 - a select index is equal to negative 1
03:00 - then we're going to delete that so now I
03:03 - need to do is add an else so if it is
03:05 - then we'll just type message box top so
03:10 - please select a file and since we're
03:12 - using the same thing right here let's go
03:15 - ahead and copy this and paste it
03:22 - okay so you can see here that we've got
03:26 - FTP delete and we also have an option to
03:29 - FTP downloader dot delete directory now
03:35 - this lets us delete a directory in the
03:40 - ftp server but we're not going to worry
03:42 - about that right now
03:43 - right now we're just going to delete
03:45 - files so in order to make it to where
03:48 - they can only delete files and not whole
03:50 - folders we need to add an end right here
03:53 - so if the selected index is negative one
03:55 - and lists FTP files that I selected item
04:01 - does not contain something then we'll
04:04 - does not contain a period or it does
04:06 - contain a period then we want to let
04:10 - them go ahead and delete it so in order
04:13 - to use contains what we're gonna have to
04:14 - do is create a variable
04:16 - sodimm file as string and we'll set it
04:21 - equal to this right here so we'll just
04:26 - copy that and paste it so if the
04:30 - selected index is not equal to negative
04:31 - one and file dot contains
04:38 - a period then go ahead and let him
04:41 - delete it now we need to get rid of this
04:43 - right here so we'll go ahead and run
04:45 - this and we'll go ahead and update not
04:51 - update so it will go to the home
04:52 - directory of our server and let's delete
04:55 - the jackhole copy so we'll go ahead and
04:58 - click delete and you may be thinking
05:03 - well it didn't work well if we go back
05:05 - to the home directory you can see it's
05:06 - gone so what we need to do whenever they
05:09 - delete a file is we'll type
05:15 - refresh lists so whenever they delete it
05:19 - it's just going to update everything
05:21 - that is in that list box now what you
05:24 - could also do is add a message box so
05:27 - that it verifies then they want to
05:28 - delete the file but we're not going to
05:30 - do that because if they're
05:32 - enough to click it and they don't want
05:33 - it deleted then that's their own fault
05:35 - so we'll go ahead and go to home
05:37 - directory and let's go ahead and delete
05:39 - this right here and you can see that
05:41 - it's gone now and if we click a folder
05:44 - right here and click delete it'll say
05:47 - error please select a file because that
05:48 - is a folder and then we can open that
05:50 - folder and we can delete stuff in there
05:52 - so we'll go ahead and close out of that
05:54 - and so put in this code if you haven't
05:57 - already make sure you change the button
06:00 - download code and once you've done that
06:02 - if you understand everything and you
06:04 - don't have any questions move on to the
06:05 - next tutorial
