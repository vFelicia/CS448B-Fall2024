00:00 - hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/
00:03 - onli gamer for the New Boston and in
00:06 - this tutorial we're going to be talking
00:08 - about updating the server now we don't
00:10 - want the user to just be able to um put
00:14 - in any server they want and the username
00:16 - um and screw up what's going on and even
00:19 - if they do just put something new in um
00:21 - it's not going to do anything with it
00:22 - because it's already set the username
00:24 - and the password and the server so what
00:27 - we want to do is for each one of these
00:30 - we want to disable them so we'll set
00:33 - enabled equal to false enabled equal to
00:36 - false and then enabled equal to false on
00:40 - this so when they click update server or
00:44 - update settings what we want to do is we
00:47 - want to give them the opportunity to
00:49 - update their settings so let's go ahead
00:52 - and create a bleen up here so private is
00:57 - updating as boine
01:02 - and let's go ahead and set that equal
01:04 - to
01:09 - false so or let's set it equal to yeah
01:15 - false so whenever they click it is
01:19 - updating is going to be equal to not is
01:23 - updating so basically what this means is
01:25 - it's going to um give you the opposite
01:28 - each time you click the button so when
01:29 - you click the the button the first time
01:31 - is updating it's going to be equal to
01:32 - true and then when you click it again
01:34 - it's going to be equal to false so each
01:36 - time this is clicked it just switches
01:37 - this to the opposite and because it's B
01:40 - it's easy to do that so is updating is
01:42 - equal to not is updating which is
01:44 - basically just flip it so if is
01:50 - updating then what do we want to do now
01:53 - we could use if is updating equals to
01:55 - true
01:57 - but we all we have to do is type if is
02:00 - updating so if is updating so if this is
02:03 - true right here then what do we want to
02:05 - do well we want to enable the
02:09 - server um credentials so
02:12 - private sub enable
02:17 - updating so under enable updating we'll
02:20 - just go ahead and
02:21 - type uh text FTP pass.
02:25 - enabled equals true text FTP server.
02:31 - enabled equals
02:32 - true and text FTP user.
02:38 - enabled equals
02:43 - true and what we can do instead of
02:47 - having to create two subs enable
02:48 - updating um and um disable updating we
02:53 - can just do Public
02:55 - Sub updating
02:57 - server and we'll have it take a buen so
03:01 - Bal uh
03:03 - is
03:06 - updating as
03:09 - boine so text FTP F xtp FTP pass.
03:14 - enabled is going to be equal to is
03:16 - updating and now let's go ahead and
03:19 - change this right here to something else
03:22 - so let's just do is
03:24 - up cuz we don't want dup duplicate
03:27 - variables so text FTP server. enabled
03:31 - equals is up and then once again it's
03:34 - going to be equal to is up so if they're
03:38 - updating then what we want to do is type
03:40 - updating
03:42 - server and for the ballen let's just go
03:45 - ahead and
03:46 - do
03:49 - true then what we want to do is we want
03:51 - to set the credentials so FTP
03:56 - downloader uh well before we do that so
04:00 - if it's updating then it's going to
04:01 - enable
04:03 - those and then it's going to change the
04:07 - button label so button update
04:11 - settings.
04:13 - text
04:15 - equals save
04:17 - settings let's make sure this
04:19 - corresponds to what we have or we'll do
04:23 - save server settings so it's going to be
04:26 - equal to
04:28 - that and
04:30 - then what we can do
04:33 - is if not is updating so if they clicked
04:39 - it again um and then um we need to
04:44 - do else if so if they're not updating so
04:49 - if they clicked it and it lets them
04:50 - update it and they it says save server
04:53 - settings and they click it again what we
04:55 - want to do is save those settings so
04:57 - we'll type updating
05:00 - server and we will pass false to that
05:04 - and then we'll set the text button
05:05 - update
05:06 - settings do text is going to be equal
05:11 - to update
05:17 - server okay so now what we want to do is
05:20 - we we want to save their settings so FTP
05:23 - downloader dot username is going to be
05:26 - equal to text FTP user
05:31 - um.
05:33 - text and then we'll set the password and
05:35 - the
05:54 - server and then we'll just go ahead and
05:56 - trim that to get rid of any white spaces
06:00 - so we can go ahead and run
06:03 - this and when we click update server it
06:06 - gives us save server settings and let's
06:09 - just leave it the same and when we click
06:10 - save server settings it's going to save
06:12 - those settings now what we can also do
06:14 - is we can disable all these buttons
06:16 - whenever that's happening so that they
06:17 - can't use them so go ahead put this code
06:19 - in and then once you've done that move
06:21 - on to the next tutorial
