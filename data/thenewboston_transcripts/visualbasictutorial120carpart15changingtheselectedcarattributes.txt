00:00 - hello YouTube say I'm here from
00:03 - youtube.com slash on live gamer for the
00:05 - new Boston and in this tutorial we're
00:07 - gonna be talking about changing the
00:10 - values of the car that is selected now
00:12 - you can see that if we click Honda CRV
00:15 - and we change the name to some other
00:18 - name and click OK
00:19 - and show the info you can see that the
00:21 - name is still Honda CRV but then if we
00:24 - go to Mustang GT you can see that the
00:26 - name has been changed for that one now
00:29 - the reason this is happening is because
00:30 - in all of our button click events all we
00:33 - do is change the default sports car name
00:36 - so what we need to do is set this to
00:38 - change the name of the selected car now
00:41 - this is quite simple we'll just type
00:42 - selected car dot car name equals
00:46 - whatever the inbox input box returns now
00:49 - let's go ahead and help the user out a
00:51 - bit so we'll just add a new line here so
00:56 - environment dot new line and then we'll
01:00 - go ahead and tell them what the old name
01:03 - is so we'll just type old name and then
01:09 - we'll add the old name of the car so we
01:13 - will type selected car dot car name now
01:17 - this is shown before the value has been
01:19 - changed so we'll go ahead and minimize
01:23 - that right here and you can see that
01:25 - I've done that for each of the other
01:27 - buttons so selected card out color and
01:29 - then I so I showed them the old color
01:32 - and then have them input it and it will
01:34 - change it for the selected car now if we
01:37 - go to get power-to-weight ratio you can
01:39 - see that I have commented commented this
01:41 - out because the selected car may or may
01:44 - not be a sports car and if it's not a
01:47 - sports car then we get an error for the
01:50 - get power-to-weight ratio so let's go
01:55 - ahead and run this and see what kind of
01:57 - results we get so let's create a new car
02:03 - we will type we will call it a Sierra
02:07 - we'll set the color to green the number
02:11 - of doors to 4
02:13 - I will set the horsepower to 300 we'll
02:15 - go ahead and click Add and here's our
02:17 - car right here now we can change the
02:20 - color of it to let's say black it'll
02:23 - show the info you can see that we get
02:25 - the colored black right there and when
02:26 - we change it again it shows us that the
02:28 - old color is black now we can change the
02:31 - number of doors to let's say 2 and you
02:34 - can see that it's going to update that
02:35 - there we can also accelerate the car so
02:39 - we can accelerate it to 45 miles per
02:41 - hour and you can see that the car is
02:43 - going 45 now if we change the name of
02:46 - this car to let's say Toyota Tundra and
02:53 - click OK it's not gonna update it in our
02:55 - list box but if we show the info info
02:58 - it's still gonna update it now there's
03:00 - an easy way to get around this and have
03:02 - it update in the list box without having
03:03 - to go through and reading every single
03:05 - item in our ArrayList so let's go ahead
03:10 - and come over here to button set name so
03:14 - whenever they set the name of that car
03:16 - what we want to do is update that name
03:19 - in the list box so we'll start off by
03:21 - accessing our list box so type list cars
03:25 - dot idem x' and now what we can do is we
03:29 - can add some parameters so you can see
03:32 - that if we arrow down here we get index
03:35 - as integer so we can access the
03:42 - currently selected index so we'll type
03:44 - list cars dot selected index and then
03:50 - we'll go ahead and set that equal to
03:52 - whatever the new name is so we'll just
03:55 - type selected car dot car name so by the
04:00 - time we're setting this new value it has
04:02 - already been changed by using the input
04:04 - box so let's go ahead and run this and
04:06 - see what kind of results we get so we
04:09 - won't make another car we'll just use
04:11 - one that's already existent so let's go
04:13 - ahead and change the name of the Mustang
04:16 - so we'll change it to Camaro SS we'll go
04:20 - ahead and click OK and you can see that
04:22 - it updates the name in our list box and
04:24 - it updates the name
04:26 - whenever we show the info so go ahead
04:30 - and add this code in for each one of
04:32 - your click events and once you've done
04:35 - that go ahead and move on to the next
04:37 - tutorial and thanks for watching
