00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org and
00:03 - this is a video tutorial for the New
00:05 - Boston in this video we're going to look
00:07 - at an Ajax request in jQuery that lets
00:11 - you simply load uh another page into
00:14 - your current page and what we're going
00:16 - to be doing is we're going to be
00:17 - creating an external file which we're
00:19 - then going to load into a div on our
00:21 - page so the first thing I'm going to do
00:23 - is go ahead and create a button that's
00:25 - going to uh sort of initiate this
00:28 - loading so let's go ahead and create an
00:31 - input
00:34 - button and I'm going to give that a
00:36 - value of load now we need to go over to
00:40 - another page in our text editor so we'll
00:42 - create a new file in our text editor and
00:44 - I'm going to
00:46 - actually uh create some content that I
00:48 - want to be displayed from this page so
00:52 - I'm going to create some strong tags
00:56 - here this has been loaded
01:02 - in to another page okay so let's go
01:07 - ahead and in the root directory let's
01:09 - save this out as um let's just call it
01:14 - page.
01:17 - HTML okay so now that we've saved um
01:20 - page. HTML inside index.php we need to
01:23 - decide where we want to put it when we
01:25 - press this button so I'm going to create
01:28 - a div underneath here
01:32 - and I'm going to give that an ID of
01:34 - content the button I'm also going to
01:37 - give an ID and I'm just going to call
01:39 - that
01:40 - button so essentially what we're going
01:42 - to do is press this button and we're
01:44 - going to have this page. HTML loaded
01:47 - into this div area here so it's an
01:50 - extremely useful and simple technique in
01:53 - jQuery that allows you to perform what
01:56 - would usually take you probably about 15
01:58 - lines to write in uh Ajax alone so let's
02:03 - go ahead and create uh an external
02:05 - Javascript file that's going to handle
02:06 - the clicking of the button and then the
02:08 - loading of the content into this div so
02:11 - I'm going to create a new file and I'm
02:13 - going to save this inside my Js
02:14 - directory and I'm going to save this as
02:23 - ajax.php page so I'm going to re um
02:27 - create another uh script tag that's
02:30 - going to handle the include of this
02:33 - file so uh we've got type is text /
02:37 - JavaScript and the file we need to
02:39 - include is JS
02:53 - ax.jpg
02:54 - inside this div so let's go ahead and
02:58 - create the event handler we need to use
03:00 - a selector and we are using this
03:02 - selector on this ID of button so we use
03:05 - a hash and then button and we say dot
03:09 - click so when the button is clicked we
03:11 - want to go ahead uh and uh carry out
03:15 - this operation to put this page inside
03:17 - the div so we need to create a function
03:20 - within
03:21 - this and uh a block as well using curly
03:24 - braces now I'm going to pull this down a
03:26 - couple of lines and inside here will be
03:28 - the one line of code which will include
03:31 - this page. HTML inside this div so it's
03:35 - extremely extremely simple to do so the
03:38 - first thing we need to do is find out
03:40 - where we want to put this page now
03:42 - that's in this div which I've called
03:44 - content so we can again use a selector
03:47 - hash
03:49 - content um and now we need to use the
03:52 - load function so do load now inside of
03:56 - load we're going to take one
03:58 - parameter or we're going to supply this
04:00 - with one parameter and that's going to
04:02 - be the name of the file you want to
04:04 - include so in this case it's page.
04:08 - HTML okay so now that we've done that we
04:10 - can go ahead to our browser and test
04:12 - this I'm going to refresh the page and
04:14 - we have our load button like we created
04:16 - earlier now the div is just underneath
04:19 - here and hopefully when we press this
04:21 - button we'll have page. HTML included
04:24 - inside our content div so we've loaded
04:27 - this page inside of our content
04:31 - so let's go ahead and press load you can
04:33 - see that the text that we created
04:35 - earlier inside of the HTML file with the
04:38 - strong tags because you can see it's
04:40 - been shown in bold has been loaded into
04:43 - this div
04:44 - area now we've included an HTML file but
04:47 - this doesn't actually have to just be an
04:49 - HTML extension let's go ahead and create
04:52 - a new file and we're going to call this
04:55 - um let's go back to the root directory
04:57 - I'm going to call this page.php
05:00 - P okay so I'm going to close page. HTML
05:03 - now we want to load the contents of
05:05 - page.php inside of this div so you may
05:09 - be wondering can we use PHP code inside
05:12 - of this uh in order to load it into our
05:14 - div well yes of course you can let's go
05:18 - ahead and just create a simple Loop
05:21 - um that's just going to count from a
05:23 - number upwards so we'll say count from
05:26 - one to 10
05:33 - so we Echo our X so we've created a
05:36 - simple Loop that's going to Echo out um
05:39 - numbers from 1 to 10 and then we are
05:42 - going to uh display this inside of our
05:45 - content div so we're using H uh we're
05:48 - using PHP code um inside of this
05:51 - page.php and loading that into
05:54 - content so let's go ahead and click
05:57 - load okay let me just go back and check
05:59 - if there's anything
06:01 - wrong uh okay um I think over here yeah
06:05 - we'll use uh this here okay so so just a
06:10 - bit of the logic behind this because I
06:11 - did make a mistake uh X is starting at
06:14 - one uh the condition is then that X
06:16 - while X is uh less than or equal to 10
06:20 - uh we uh increment X so uh the page did
06:24 - successfully load but the content didn't
06:25 - show because I had the logic mixed up
06:28 - let's goad and press load and you can
06:30 - see that we've now loaded numbers 1 to
06:32 - 10 so we've now successfully included a
06:35 - PHP file uh inside of um our uh inside
06:40 - of our content div now you may be
06:42 - thinking can I go ahead and include
06:44 - image files inside of uh my content div
06:49 - for example if I just open up my uh
06:51 - directory that I have
06:53 - here and let's look at all the files
06:55 - I've got an image called taran. jpg so
06:58 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to try
07:00 - and attempt to load this into uh my div
07:04 - directly so we uh load taran. jpg into
07:09 - our content area now this would be
07:11 - extremely useful if you wanted to load a
07:13 - file into a Content area however the
07:17 - problem with this is it's going to load
07:18 - the file contents as opposed to
07:20 - interpret it as an image what we would
07:23 - need to actually do is
07:26 - um change the headers on the document
07:28 - for this IM to be displayed correctly
07:31 - let's go ahead and see what happens now
07:32 - you'll see that uh a load of rubbish
07:34 - will eventually pop up uh this is just
07:37 - obviously the file contents for the
07:39 - image as opposed to the image directly
07:42 - so using this load method we can't
07:44 - directly load an image in however if you
07:46 - were to include an image on an HTML page
07:49 - uh you could then load that
07:50 - in so we've looked at including um a
07:53 - basic HTML file and then a PHP file with
07:57 - some PHP code in it uh obviously you can
08:00 - use other file extensions as long as the
08:02 - page can be interpreted by your uh your
08:04 - server um you can actually load um any
08:08 - page in you like uh with whatever web
08:10 - development language you choose to write
08:12 - in so that's essentially the load
08:14 - function which takes uh advantage of
08:17 - Ajax calls that would usually just
08:19 - include a page inside and like I said
08:21 - before we've uh used three lines here uh
08:24 - with with um Ajax we would probably use
08:28 - about 15 to to 20 lines
