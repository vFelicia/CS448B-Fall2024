00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org
00:03 - with a video tutorial for the New Boston
00:06 - we're going to be taking a look at
00:08 - scrolling to the top of the page using
00:10 - jQuery and the first thing that we're
00:12 - going to do is use the animate uh
00:15 - feature of jQuery to you know Force our
00:18 - users to the top of the page you've
00:19 - probably visited Pages before uh with
00:22 - lots of content on and they will have a
00:25 - link at the bottom of the page content
00:27 - uh just to say go to top and then that
00:29 - will take take you to the top of the
00:30 - page now traditionally this was done
00:33 - with um an a tag and this had a
00:37 - particular name so for example uh it
00:39 - would be called say top uh let's just go
00:42 - and take a look at our page content uh
00:44 - you can see that I've just got like a
00:45 - load of text on here uh a load of just
00:47 - Latin text on here uh just to simulate
00:50 - simulate a uh a large amount of content
00:53 - on a page uh and we would then uh have a
00:56 - link at the
00:57 - bottom uh for example go to top uh and
01:01 - this would be let's just put that in
01:03 - paragraph tags so it stays away from the
01:06 - rest of the content uh and then you
01:08 - would just sort of like reference hash
01:10 - top in this uh href and that would take
01:12 - you to the top of the page now I
01:15 - personally find there a few problems
01:16 - with this uh let's just get rid of this
01:18 - content here that was from a previous
01:21 - tutorial um when we go to the bottom we
01:23 - can click go to top and that will take
01:25 - us straight to the top of the page where
01:26 - the a tag uh was uh you know initiated
01:29 - up here so we've got this just linking
01:32 - up here now the one problem that we've
01:35 - got with this is that we can't animate
01:37 - it and it's a bit sort of like sudden
01:39 - and jerky uh the other problem that we
01:41 - have is you have to be careful where you
01:43 - place this um because you'll notice that
01:46 - at the moment we've got some white space
01:48 - just up here uh if we go down to the
01:50 - bottom of the page and click go to top
01:52 - uh you see it cuts off this white space
01:54 - uh Al together uh and as well you have
01:56 - the problem where you know you might
01:58 - want to you have to might place this a
02:01 - uh in a particular area on your page uh
02:04 - where you want the content to go to uh
02:06 - the other problem we've got is the URL
02:08 - now shows hash top so it looks slightly
02:11 - messy uh in that sense with regards to
02:13 - the URL so if you do have a problem with
02:15 - that um as I've experienced uh we can go
02:18 - ahead and use jQuery to re uh you know
02:20 - do exactly the same thing uh but you
02:23 - know a lot more effectively and we can
02:25 - add animation as well so uh let's just
02:28 - go ahead and get rid of this tag up here
02:29 - this a tag and we're going to keep this
02:32 - go to top link uh but this time we're
02:34 - going to set the HF to Hash we're not
02:36 - going to actually uh allow this link to
02:38 - go anywhere uh now this will still put a
02:41 - hash on the URL uh but we won't have
02:43 - this hash top present let's just go
02:46 - ahead and test that out so go to top at
02:49 - the moment just uh gives us a hash there
02:52 - uh but we you know don't really have the
02:53 - ability to you know uh to control this I
02:57 - mean I think we do but I'm not going to
02:58 - cover it in this tutorial
03:00 - so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
03:01 - give this uh go to top link a class and
03:05 - this is going to be called top and what
03:07 - we can do in jQuery is we can uh allow
03:10 - when this Link's clicked to animate to
03:12 - the top of the page so we don't need any
03:14 - a tags on here uh and you can also use
03:17 - this function to actually you know
03:19 - perhaps Supply a um you know although
03:22 - not not really you know advisable uh but
03:26 - you can use a onclick and for example
03:28 - you could use a top to uh and then
03:30 - specify um an element in here of your
03:33 - page so there's a variety of different
03:35 - ways we can do this and with jQuery it
03:38 - makes it extremely easy as well so we've
03:41 - got this go to top link here and the
03:43 - class is called top so we're going to
03:45 - use jQuery to reference this link now
03:48 - I've included uh ext.js on my page as
03:51 - well as jQuery obviously we need to make
03:53 - use of jQuery and ext.js is where we're
03:56 - going to be writing all of our jQuery
03:58 - code and there isn't really a lot of
04:00 - code to write um but we're going to look
04:01 - at it quite carefully so now that we've
04:04 - done this we can come over to
04:05 - ext.js uh and we want to go ahead and
04:08 - wait um for the document to load as we
04:10 - usually would uh with jQuery so
04:12 - document. ready or not really the
04:15 - document to load this doesn't do this it
04:17 - just you know this initiates as soon as
04:20 - the Dom is
04:21 - available so the first thing we want to
04:24 - go ahead and do is set an event handler
04:26 - to this link uh so we know when this
04:28 - class top has been pressed and you can
04:31 - use these links anywhere and give them
04:33 - the same class and it'll have exactly
04:34 - the same effect so you could have them
04:35 - say uh twice on your page one halfway
04:38 - down uh and one at the bottom so we are
04:43 - using a jQuery selector to select do top
04:46 - we selecting a class called top and we
04:49 - want to say dot click so now when uh our
04:52 - link is clicked uh we perform a function
04:55 - within here so we outline our
04:58 - function and we bring these uh braces
05:01 - down or brackets down uh so anything
05:03 - inside of here now uh will execute when
05:06 - this click uh when this when this link
05:08 - has been clicked or any other element
05:10 - associated with top is
05:12 - clicked okay so now we want to go ahead
05:14 - and actually animate the top of the page
05:16 - so we are using another selector and
05:18 - this is HTML body so we're selecting
05:22 - HTML and body uh as the selector so this
05:26 - is what where we want to animate to so
05:28 - we use the animate function in jQuery uh
05:32 - and we're going to take two parameters
05:33 - here and the first one is the actions or
05:36 - the animations that we want to perform
05:38 - uh and then the speed afterwards so
05:40 - we'll set this to zero for now so in
05:43 - inside here the animation that we want
05:45 - to uh actually carry out is scroll top
05:49 - and the value is going to be zero we
05:51 - want to scroll to the very top of HTML
05:54 - uh and body so we're scrolling to zero
05:57 - position zero here uh if we were to
06:00 - change this to say 20 it would scroll
06:02 - you know sort of like 20 in measurement
06:05 - from the very top uh and obviously zero
06:08 - is the speed so now that we've done this
06:10 - we're actually ready to go we can go
06:12 - ahead and test our linkout let's go to
06:14 - the bottom and click go to top and
06:16 - you'll see it takes us all the way to
06:18 - the top of the document including this
06:20 - Whit space area as well uh which means
06:23 - we've eliminated the need to even put an
06:25 - a tag in in the first place uh but
06:27 - considering that we had it at the very
06:29 - top of our body it still didn't show the
06:31 - whole document so we've animated to the
06:33 - very top uh you'll also note that if we
06:35 - do change this value I'll go ahead and
06:37 - change that to say 100 uh let's go and
06:40 - refresh the page and come down to the
06:43 - bottom and click go to top uh oh and you
06:46 - see that hasn't actually worked okay
06:48 - maybe I'm wrong uh maybe I'm wrong in
06:51 - that sense but anyway uh scroll top uh
06:54 - zero and we want to go ahead and uh in
06:56 - fact this might work as plus 20 let me
06:59 - just go ahead and try
07:02 - this no it hasn't okay so you could
07:05 - probably go ahead and look that up and
07:07 - probably having a funny moment where I'm
07:09 - unsure what I'm doing but we've got this
07:11 - last um integer here which we can either
07:15 - set to a millisecond speed or a textual
07:18 - representation of a speed so obviously
07:21 - speeds in jqu we gr jQuery sorry we have
07:24 - slow uh normal and fast so we can either
07:29 - either specify them or we can go ahead
07:31 - and specify an amount of milliseconds
07:34 - that we want this time uh this scroll to
07:36 - happen so from the very bottom when we
07:38 - click it to the top we might want to say
07:40 - 3 seconds which would be 3,000
07:42 - milliseconds so I'm going to go ahead
07:44 - and first of all choose uh slow uh and
07:47 - then we'll look at the difference so
07:48 - this will automatically uh you know
07:51 - create an animation because we've
07:52 - supplied it with a speed so instead of
07:55 - uh applying supplying it with zero we're
07:57 - now applying it with a particular speed
07:59 - so let go ahead and click go to top and
08:01 - you can see that that scrolled uh with a
08:03 - nice slow speed up the top of the page
08:05 - uh we could also then go ahead um if
08:07 - that might get annoying to your users
08:09 - for example if you had sort of a lot of
08:12 - content and you wanted them to go more
08:14 - or less straight to the top but still
08:15 - maintain some kind of Animation uh you
08:18 - could go ahead and change it to fast uh
08:20 - and that you know speeds up to the top
08:23 - but also you know shows the nice
08:25 - scrolling animation as well uh and as I
08:27 - mentioned we could use uh
08:30 - uh a speed such as 10 seconds uh so for
08:33 - example if you did need this kind of
08:34 - effect I think it's quite effective if
08:36 - you were to have you know say uh an
08:39 - application that uh or or web page that
08:42 - you wanted to just manually scroll the
08:44 - user down the page to display all the
08:46 - content uh if it was a more sort of
08:48 - visual site as opposed to you know
08:50 - something being able to be used you
08:52 - could use this but you could use scroll
08:53 - to the bottom instead uh so you could
08:55 - start say at the top of the page and
08:57 - scroll down to the bottom anyway let's
08:59 - go ahead ahead and click go to top and
09:00 - you can see that this slowly starts to
09:02 - scroll uh up the page uh and you can
09:05 - probably tell now how nice it would be
09:08 - if you were to you know enter a user
09:11 - into a website and have them scroll all
09:13 - the way down to the bottom to view all
09:15 - the content uh and perhaps you could
09:16 - have some kind of mouse move event to
09:18 - stop this at particular points so uh
09:21 - essentially I've gone on about you know
09:24 - adding to this and creating animation
09:26 - with it uh so I guess you could call it
09:28 - some kind of animating tutorial
09:30 - uh but for now we've selected the HTML
09:32 - body we've animated by scrolling to the
09:34 - top uh and here we've supplied 10
09:36 - seconds uh and we've done this all with
09:38 - just creating our link and letting
09:40 - jQuery handle this so much better than
09:42 - supplying uh the a tags ourself so
09:45 - that's how we are going to scroll to the
09:47 - top using a go to top Link in jQuery
