00:00 - what's up guys it's Bucky and welcome to
00:02 - another back Amon tutorial in this
00:04 - tutorial we're going to continue talking
00:06 - about back Amon strategy and
00:08 - specifically hitting versus making a new
00:11 - point now you know that it's always good
00:13 - to hit them when they have one checker
00:16 - on a point or to make a new point which
00:18 - means taking two or more Checkers and
00:20 - owning a new Point both of these are
00:23 - good tactics but you often come across
00:25 - case scenarios where you can either have
00:27 - the option of a hitting one of Checkers
00:30 - or B making a new point on the board so
00:34 - in this tutorial we're going to weigh
00:36 - the advantages and disadvantages of both
00:39 - now the common rule is it's usually
00:42 - better to hit them than to make a new
00:44 - point and this doesn't only apply to
00:47 - back ining but everyday life usually you
00:49 - want to hit someone as often as you can
00:51 - so you know I'm not only teaching you
00:53 - back gaming lessons but also life
00:56 - lessons as well whenever you get the
00:57 - opportunity to hit someone do it that's
01:00 - all I'm saying so anyways let's go ahead
01:02 - and take a look at a back gaming example
01:05 - so we now rolled a 31 U as brown so here
01:08 - are your two options you can go ahead
01:10 - and play 1 2 3 one and this gives you a
01:13 - new point and you now own the Five Point
01:16 - making it harder for them to escape this
01:18 - is a good move but it isn't your best
01:20 - option you can also play your 3-1 this
01:22 - way you can also move one Checker 1 2 3
01:26 - 4 hit them and send them up on the bar
01:29 - so when you have the option between
01:31 - making a new point and hitting them what
01:34 - do you choose and why well the correct
01:36 - answer like I said before is you should
01:38 - hit him in this case scenario and in
01:41 - most case scenarios and you should do
01:42 - for do that for three main reasons the
01:45 - first reason is look how close white was
01:48 - to bearing off they were already in
01:50 - their home board so they're ready to
01:51 - Bear off and that Checker is ready to go
01:54 - from the end game start bearing off and
01:56 - potentially win the game but now
01:58 - whenever you hit them it sends them way
02:00 - back to the beginning and now this
02:02 - Checker instead of being able to Bear
02:04 - off with a five now has to travel the
02:06 - total distance around the board in order
02:08 - to Bear off so that's why hitting them
02:11 - is good in that sense another way is you
02:15 - know how I said making a new point is a
02:17 - good idea like you could do right there
02:19 - we'll check this out whenever you hit
02:21 - them you don't just knock them on the
02:23 - bar but you also are making a new point
02:26 - or at least starting to right here this
02:28 - is half a point basically and all you
02:30 - need to make a new point on this 20 is
02:33 - to roll a four on your next turn on your
02:36 - next turn as soon as you roll a four not
02:38 - only do you got your new point right
02:40 - here but they're also still on the bar
02:42 - so that's pretty much like making half a
02:44 - point already so you can either make a
02:46 - point with this or hit them and make
02:48 - half the point just look at it that way
02:50 - and the last thing I want to point out
02:53 - is if you don't hit them and you make a
02:55 - new point right here what happened you
02:58 - gave white the opport opportunity to
03:00 - make a new point on their next turn so
03:03 - if they roll a one that five the five
03:06 - point now belongs to them or your 20
03:09 - point so instead of you taking that
03:12 - point they now have the point and that
03:14 - gives the potential for your Checkers to
03:16 - be trapped back here so you never want
03:18 - to give them the opportunity to trap
03:21 - your Checkers behind and you always want
03:23 - to make points so not only when you get
03:26 - uh attacked and you need to re-enter
03:29 - that it gives you an opportunity to
03:31 - re-enter more successfully but also your
03:34 - trekers you don't ever want them to be
03:36 - trapped here for example if they made a
03:38 - perfect prime or any Prime so anyways
03:41 - those are three reasons why you should
03:44 - hit them rather than making a new point
03:46 - a it sends their white Checker all the
03:48 - way back so they have to travel the
03:50 - total distance of the board B you start
03:53 - a new point which on your next turn it
03:56 - only takes one/ four to make your new
03:57 - point anyways and see the last thing you
04:01 - never want your Checkers to get trapped
04:03 - back here so whenever you get an
04:05 - opportunity and make a point in their
04:06 - home board you want to do that so
04:08 - anyways that's all I have for you guys
04:10 - for this tutorial remember it's always
04:12 - better to hit someone than to not so
