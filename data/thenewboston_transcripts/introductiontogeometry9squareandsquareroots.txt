00:01 - so we're gonna be talking about squares
00:04 - because in our next video they're gonna
00:07 - help us solve some triangle problems so
00:12 - a square is basically like it's written
00:16 - like this and it's basically the number
00:18 - times itself so right here we have x
00:23 - squared so that's just x times X so
00:29 - we're gonna do some examples where we're
00:34 - just gonna write out this square and
00:37 - find out what it equals
00:38 - so 11 squared is just saying 11 times 11
00:45 - equals what and 11 times 11 is equal to
00:51 - a hundred and twenty-one so 1 times 1 is
00:57 - equal to 1 4 times 4 is equal to 16 2.3
01:11 - times 2.3
01:24 - now
01:32 - 5.29 six times six equals thirty-six and
01:39 - when we have a fraction like we do right
01:43 - here you square the top and square the
01:48 - bottom so ya 1 times 1 over 2 times to
01:54 - the top equals 1 the bottom equals 4 so
02:00 - that's what you do when you square a
02:02 - number now to undo a square you take the
02:07 - square root of a number so when you take
02:09 - the square root of a number you you're
02:12 - finding what number of times
02:16 - no you're finding what number times
02:20 - itself equals the square so for x
02:24 - squared we know if we took the square
02:29 - root of x squared since we know that
02:35 - it's x times X when we take the square
02:42 - root of it we just have X a square root
02:46 - is how you undo a squared function so
02:51 - now we're you're going to do some
02:52 - examples the square root of 121 well
02:59 - this is just saying the square root of
03:02 - 11 11 times 11 so when you take this
03:07 - square root you get rid of one of those
03:10 - 11s and you just get 111 because this is
03:15 - saying if I squared 11 I would get a
03:19 - hundred and twenty-one which is true so
03:23 - this one's pretty easy what times one
03:26 - equals 110 times 10 so you get ten now
03:34 - just like we square the top and the
03:39 - bottom of a fraction we're gonna take
03:41 - the square root
03:43 - of the top and bottom separately so what
03:49 - times itself gives me 4 well 2 times
03:53 - itself gives me 4 and what times itself
03:56 - gives me 5 5 so the answer is 2/5 the
04:02 - square root of 9 is just 9 is just 3
04:07 - times 3 and that gives us 3 16 4 times 4
04:16 - and then 1 over 9 since the square root
04:24 - of 9 is 3 and we know that the square
04:27 - root of 1 is 1
04:29 - it's just 1/3 so when you raise a number
04:37 - to the second degree you're saying x
04:40 - squared and when we want to undo that
04:44 - squared we take the square root and we
04:46 - go back to the original number so this
04:49 - is gonna help us with triangles and
04:51 - solving sides of triangles in our next
04:54 - video so make sure you come back and
04:56 - watch that
