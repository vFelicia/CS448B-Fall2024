00:00 - hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com
00:03 - slash on live gamer for the new Boston
00:05 - and this tutorial we're going to be
00:07 - taking a look at the do until loop so
00:10 - now basically what the do until loop is
00:12 - is it's similar to the for loop and that
00:14 - it will do a certain block of code over
00:17 - and over again until a certain value is
00:19 - reached but the difference is is that
00:22 - when you use a for loop the developer
00:24 - knows exactly how many times that for
00:26 - loop is going to run so let's say we did
00:28 - for num1 equals 1 to 20 we know that
00:33 - that's going to go 20 times because we
00:34 - specified that it needs to go that many
00:37 - times now what the do until loop it will
00:40 - run until a certain value is reached and
00:45 - now sometimes this will run I don't know
00:48 - let's say for example we make a do until
00:50 - loop do until num1 equals 10 this could
00:55 - run ten times or it could run a thousand
00:57 - times if num1 is equal to let's say
01:01 - negative 990 that will run a thousand
01:04 - times now let's go ahead and make a do
01:07 - one two loop example so we'll go ahead
01:09 - and select a new project will do a
01:12 - console application and we'll type do
01:15 - until loop
01:21 - now let's zoom in here okay now let's go
01:28 - ahead and add console dot readline so I
01:32 - won't forget that at the end and now
01:34 - let's come up here and we'll declare a
01:36 - variable so we'll do dim num1 as integer
01:42 - and we'll set it equal to negative well
01:46 - let's just set it equal to zero to start
01:47 - with okay so now what we're going to do
01:51 - is we are going to create our do until
01:54 - loop so type do until num1 is equal to
02:00 - let's do 10 and you can see here that it
02:04 - created this loop word for us so
02:07 - basically what this means is it's
02:08 - similar to the next in the for loop once
02:11 - it hits this statement right here it's
02:12 - going to come back around to the top of
02:15 - the do until loop and if num1 is not
02:18 - equal to 10 then it's going to go ahead
02:20 - and keep looping until num1 is equal to
02:23 - 10 and then just going to go down to the
02:25 - line after the loop statement okay so
02:29 - what we want to do until num1 is equal
02:31 - to 10 so we'll just write console dot
02:34 - write line num1 now if we run this then
02:41 - we it will print out 0 over and over and
02:44 - over again because we haven't
02:45 - incremented num1 it's always going to be
02:47 - equal to 0 so let's just do after
02:50 - console dot write line num1 will just
02:53 - type num1 plus equals 1 so basically
02:58 - what this is going to do is it's going
02:59 - to print out num1 and then it's going to
03:01 - add 1 to it it's go up it's going to
03:03 - loop until num 1 is equal to 10 and it's
03:05 - going to do console dot read line so you
03:09 - can see if we run this it goes 1 2 3 4 5
03:14 - 6 7 8 9 now you can see that it stops at
03:17 - 9 now the reason it does this is because
03:20 - it does it until num1 equals 10 so if
03:23 - num1 is equal to 10 then it's not going
03:24 - to do it now if we set that equal to 11
03:27 - then it would print out all the way up
03:29 - to 10 now we can also increment num1 in
03:33 - different values
03:34 - so we can do num1 plus equals 2 and you
03:38 - can see if we run this we get 0 2 4 6 8
03:44 - now we can also set num1 to a different
03:47 - value other than 0 at the beginning so
03:49 - if we set it equal to negative 20 then
03:52 - if we go ahead and do until num1 equals
03:54 - 10 it's going to do it a different
03:55 - amount of times so it's going to start
03:58 - at negative 20 negative 18 it's going to
04:00 - increment it by 2 all the way until it
04:01 - gets to 8 so go ahead and practice and
04:06 - make a couple do onto loops once you got
04:08 - those down and you know you're not going
04:10 - to forget them go ahead and move on to
04:11 - the next tutorial and thanks for
04:13 - watching guys
