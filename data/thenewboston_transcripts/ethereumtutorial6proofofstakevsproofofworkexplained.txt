00:00 - alrighty i'll welcome back to another
00:02 - video and in this one i just wanted to
00:04 - respond to a couple questions that i got
00:06 - in the last video the first one was
00:08 - about mining in the puzzle
00:10 - and for that i want to mention that i'm
00:12 - actually going to be teaching this topic
00:14 - in more detail in a separate blockchain
00:16 - series so for the sake of preventing
00:18 - duplicate content i'm going to hold off
00:20 - on that for now really great question
00:22 - though
00:23 - and the other request that i got was to
00:26 - explain a little bit more about proof of
00:28 - stake so that's what we're going to be
00:30 - going over in this video so let's go
00:32 - ahead and hop right into it
00:34 - so as we mentioned in the last video
00:35 - ethereum is moving from a proof of work
00:37 - system to a proof of stake system which
00:40 - is really just an alternative consensus
00:42 - mechanism and
00:45 - what it boils down to the main change is
00:47 - that instead of letting nodes with the
00:49 - most computing power
00:51 - generate blocks through work or in other
00:53 - words energy use the proof of stake
00:56 - system is going to allow the nodes who
00:58 - stake their ether and by staking ether i
01:01 - basically mean just depositing it into
01:03 - the network is collateral or locking it
01:05 - up so the nodes who stake ether are
01:08 - going to be the ones able to generate
01:10 - blocks and this change comes with a
01:11 - couple key benefits the first one pretty
01:14 - obvious but of course worth mentioning
01:16 - and that is with this new system
01:19 - there is no longer the requirement for
01:21 - you know these huge investments in
01:23 - hardware or energy costs so that's of
01:26 - course good for the environment and you
01:28 - know a lot of different reasons not to
01:29 - use excess energy now the other benefit
01:32 - is that this change actually allows for
01:34 - a few technological or architectural
01:36 - improvements and we're going to be
01:38 - taking a closer look at those throughout
01:40 - the video now the first component of
01:42 - this architecture that i want to take a
01:43 - look at is something called the shard
01:45 - chains s-h-a-r-d
01:47 - and before we can even get to them we do
01:49 - need a very basic understanding of what
01:51 - sharding is in general
01:53 - so sharding technically it's the process
01:56 - of splitting a database horizontally to
01:59 - distribute the load so what does that
02:01 - mean so imagine that you have one
02:03 - computer and it only has three gigabytes
02:06 - worth of memory in total the entire hard
02:08 - drive it only has three gigabytes so you
02:11 - install a database on it and it's
02:12 - growing okay one gigabyte two gigabyte
02:15 - three gigabyte now you're maxed out
02:17 - so what do you do well you can keep
02:20 - buying a bigger hard drive and then a
02:21 - bigger one and then a bigger one but
02:23 - eventually you're going to come to a
02:25 - point where well quite frankly they
02:27 - don't sell hard drives big enough for
02:28 - what you need so another option is
02:30 - taking that same data and splitting it
02:33 - out across multiple machines so instead
02:35 - of one computer
02:37 - where you maxed out at three gigabytes
02:39 - you can set up three different computers
02:41 - and then you can take this gigabyte put
02:44 - on this one this gigabyte put on this
02:46 - one this gigabyte and put it on this one
02:48 - so your total capacity now instead of
02:50 - three gigabytes
02:52 - is nine
02:54 - and you still have six remaining
02:56 - gigabytes of free space before you need
02:58 - to scale again so again sharding is just
03:01 - taking a big chunk of data and splitting
03:03 - it up to help distribute the load now
03:06 - with the proof of stake update what
03:08 - ethereum is planning on doing is taking
03:10 - this key concept of sharding and porting
03:12 - it over to the blockchain ecosystem
03:15 - through the creation of
03:17 - these right here which are called shard
03:19 - chains
03:21 - and i'm sure you can guess what the
03:22 - point of these is basically to take one
03:25 - big monolithic chain one big main chain
03:28 - and splitting up the data into smaller
03:31 - shards or in this case shard chains so
03:34 - for ethereum the plan is actually to
03:36 - have 64 of these shard chains i just
03:38 - drew three on here because well uh i
03:41 - didn't want 64 chains clogging up my ui
03:44 - but you get the idea so with these shard
03:46 - chains validators only need to store or
03:49 - in other words run the data for the
03:51 - shard that they're validating and not
03:53 - the entire network
03:54 - so this reduces the hardware
03:56 - requirements for each node by allowing
03:58 - more people to participate therefore
04:01 - improving security through greater
04:03 - decentralization so once a node is in
04:06 - the validator pool
04:08 - by staking enough eath then they can be
04:10 - assigned to a certain shard so again the
04:13 - validator pool is just a list of
04:15 - eligible nodes and it pretty much just
04:17 - means whenever you staked enough eth
04:19 - which is 32 that you're eligible to
04:22 - become a validator now these shard
04:24 - chains they're often called the data
04:26 - layer d8ta
04:28 - and that's because i'm sure you can
04:30 - guess but it's where the majority of the
04:32 - data of the network is going to be
04:33 - stored
04:34 - now there's also another layer or chain
04:38 - in the system and that's called the
04:39 - beacon chain
04:40 - so this is often called the coordination
04:43 - layer so again the coordination layer
04:45 - in the data layer
04:47 - so let's go ahead and talk about this
04:49 - coordination layer so because there are
04:51 - 64 shard chains in this new system
04:54 - coordination between them is necessary
04:56 - and that coordination is going to be
04:58 - done by the beacon chain so what the
05:00 - beacon chain is going to do is it
05:02 - actually does quite a few things but one
05:04 - of the important things is that it's
05:06 - going to receive state information from
05:08 - these shards and it's going to make it
05:10 - available to other shards so it
05:13 - essentially allows the entire network to
05:15 - stay in sync now another thing that i
05:17 - want to mention is that it's really the
05:19 - transactions themselves that are split
05:22 - up across these shards and not the
05:24 - actual network state
05:26 - now by network state i mean the current
05:28 - state of the network not so much the
05:30 - historical state
05:32 - now the reason is that the transactions
05:35 - are basically the long-term storage and
05:38 - after processing them each validator it
05:40 - doesn't really need to keep a record of
05:42 - them anymore in terms of the validation
05:44 - process they really only need to know
05:47 - the current state of the network in
05:48 - order to properly validate incoming
05:50 - transactions so now let's see how some
05:52 - of these pieces fit together
05:54 - so
05:55 - starting from the very beginning users
05:57 - are going to need to stake 32e to become
05:59 - a validator in the network
06:02 - now validators they really just do the
06:04 - same thing before just without the
06:05 - puzzle
06:06 - mainly responsible for validating
06:08 - transactions and creating blocks from
06:10 - those transactions now in this system
06:14 - certain validators are going to be
06:15 - algorithmically chosen by the beacon
06:18 - chain to propose new blocks and these
06:21 - validators are called the proposers
06:24 - now the other validators are responsible
06:27 - for checking and confirming the blocks
06:29 - proposed by the proposer and these other
06:32 - validators are called the attesters now
06:35 - these validators can lose a portion of
06:37 - their stake for things like going
06:39 - offline or failing to validate and they
06:41 - can actually lose their entire stake for
06:44 - deliberate collusion in other words if
06:46 - they are intentionally trying to be
06:48 - malicious somehow so validator stake is
06:51 - also used as a way to incentivize good
06:53 - behavior
06:54 - so what happens is whenever you submit a
06:57 - transaction to the network a proposer is
07:00 - going to be responsible for adding your
07:02 - transaction to something called a shard
07:04 - block
07:05 - just copy this and get this new
07:07 - shard block going right here
07:09 - all right
07:10 - so for any of the validators that aren't
07:12 - chosen to propose a new shard block
07:15 - these are called the attesters
07:18 - and they're going to have to attest to
07:20 - another validator's proposal in this
07:22 - case this one is the proposer
07:24 - and pretty much confirm that everything
07:26 - looks good as it should
07:28 - now a testing if that term kind of
07:31 - confuses you or you're not familiar with
07:33 - it you can think of it testing is pretty
07:34 - much just saying hey this block looks
07:36 - good to me another cool fact well i
07:38 - don't know cool interesting i guess is
07:41 - that it's actually the
07:42 - attestation as it's called i believe
07:44 - that's how you pronounce it that's
07:46 - recorded on the beacon chain and not the
07:49 - transaction itself
07:52 - so attestations or in other words these
07:55 - sayings of yup this block looks good to
07:57 - me that's actually the main source of
07:59 - load on the beacon chain
08:01 - so now let's get into committees slots
08:03 - and epics
08:05 - so even though i drew these groups kind
08:07 - of uh simple with only four nodes in
08:09 - them
08:10 - in reality there are at least 128
08:13 - validators again that's 128 that are
08:16 - required to attest to each block and
08:19 - that group of validators is technically
08:21 - known as the committee now each
08:23 - committee has a time frame in which to
08:26 - propose and validate a sharp block and
08:28 - this time frame is known as a slot so a
08:31 - slot is really just a chance for a block
08:35 - to be added to both the beacon chain and
08:38 - the shards now just to some additional
08:40 - info each one of these slots is actually
08:43 - 12 seconds long and an epic
08:46 - is just 32 slots
08:48 - and it ends up being right around like
08:51 - six and a half minutes but again each
08:53 - slot 12 seconds long and there are 32
08:56 - slots in something called an epic
08:58 - now only one valid block is created per
09:02 - slot now after each one of these epics
09:05 - what's going to happen is that these
09:06 - committees are going to be thrown back
09:08 - into that pool randomized mixed up and
09:11 - new committees created and this really
09:13 - just helps the shards keep safe from bad
09:16 - actors or whenever you have nodes in
09:18 - there too long they may start colluding
09:20 - so really just help to keep the network
09:22 - safe through randomization now just to
09:24 - mention the reward process real quick is
09:27 - that these validators they actually get
09:29 - rewarded for proposing and attesting two
09:33 - blocks and like we said before if any of
09:35 - these validators attest to a malicious
09:37 - block or a block that they shouldn't
09:39 - maybe it's invalid for whatever reason
09:41 - that they will actually lose their
09:43 - entire stake
09:44 - now the last thing i want to discuss is
09:46 - a topic called crosslinks and that is
09:48 - once a new shard block actually let me
09:50 - duplicate this so duplicating this but
09:53 - it's actually referencing the same block
09:55 - and you'll see why in just a second
09:58 - but essentially what i wanted to say is
10:00 - that once a shard block has enough
10:02 - attestations then what's going to happen
10:05 - is something called a cross link is
10:07 - going to be formed and this essentially
10:09 - just confirms the inclusion of the block
10:12 - in the beacon chain now these cross
10:14 - links right here again are how the
10:16 - beacon chain are going to follow the
10:18 - head of the shard chain and by knowing
10:20 - the head of the chain you can
10:23 - essentially identify the updated state
10:25 - for the entire chain and this is what is
10:28 - going to allow all of these shards
10:31 - to stay in sync
10:33 - something like this
10:35 - so again i know that there's a lot with
10:37 - this proven stake system um the good
10:40 - news is if you are primarily a developer
10:43 - writing solidity contracts uh want to
10:45 - create dapps you really don't need to
10:47 - know too much about this however this
10:49 - was just a response to some of the
10:51 - questions i was getting in the last
10:52 - video
10:53 - so there you go there's your quick
10:55 - overview on uh proof of stake hope you
10:57 - enjoyed it and i will see you in the
10:59 - next video
