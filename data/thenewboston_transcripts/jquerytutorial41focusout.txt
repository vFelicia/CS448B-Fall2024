00:00 - hi this is Alex from PHP Academy with a
00:02 - video tutorial for the New Boston in the
00:06 - last tutorial we looked at the jQuery
00:08 - focus in event handler to create a field
00:12 - on our page well to activate this div
00:16 - when a field in our page is clicked so
00:18 - every time we click on a field or focus
00:20 - into a field using tab we have this div
00:24 - displayed and we noted the difference
00:26 - between this and click and also why
00:29 - click shouldn't really be used in this
00:31 - case now in this part of the tutorial
00:34 - we're going to look at Focus out and
00:36 - we're going to take the lazy
00:38 - probably incorrect way to do things well
00:41 - yes the incorrect way to do things
00:43 - however this is just going to
00:44 - demonstrate the focus out um event
00:47 - handler so with my focus in with my name
00:51 - and my focus in with my age the two
00:53 - fields that I currently have on the page
00:56 - these both have functions to them that
00:59 - allow us to to um display this text in a
01:03 - div uh or in a span rather when the
01:06 - field comes into Focus I'm going to copy
01:09 - and paste these just
01:11 - underneath and I'm going to change focus
01:14 - in to focus out and the same with this
01:16 - one focus in to focus out so now we have
01:20 - four event handlers for each name um
01:24 - let's just rearrange these to make them
01:26 - a bit easier to talk about we have the
01:29 - FOC Fus in for name when we focus in on
01:32 - name it says enter your full name now
01:34 - when we focus out we want the span to
01:38 - have no text in it at all or you might
01:41 - want to perform some kind of validation
01:43 - procedure here for example validate and
01:47 - then in here you could specify the field
01:49 - you want to validate so there's a
01:52 - variety of options you can choose and uh
01:55 - depending on what you're doing with this
01:57 - uh you can change it to suit what you
01:59 - need to to do so again for age we have
02:02 - focus in which creates the text inside
02:05 - the span using the HTML function enter
02:07 - your current age with the focus out we
02:10 - also want this to be blank so let's go
02:13 - to our page and see how this works when
02:15 - I click on um the first field it says
02:18 - enter your full name as we've seen in
02:20 - the previous part of the tutorial now
02:22 - when I focus out you can see that this
02:25 - disappears so when I click on the when I
02:27 - click on your name and I tab down to
02:30 - your age these uh Val this value
02:33 - disappears and this value is uh back
02:35 - again if we were to use uh shift and tab
02:39 - to go back up you can see that the same
02:41 - happens again so despite the fact that
02:44 - we've already spoken about the click uh
02:47 - this now really demonstrates how
02:48 - actually useful it
02:50 - is so as I've said before this was just
02:53 - to demonstrate the event handler however
02:56 - there are better ways to do this than
02:58 - actually copying the uh the event
03:01 - handlers down your page so probably a
03:05 - good idea to look into this to avoid
03:07 - duplicating code
03:09 - unnecessarily
