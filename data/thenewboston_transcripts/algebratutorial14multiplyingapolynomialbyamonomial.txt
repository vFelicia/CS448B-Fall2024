00:02 - so last time we talked about adding and
00:06 - subtracting
00:08 - pooms but today we're going to start
00:10 - with multiplication and we're going to
00:12 - start it off a little bit easier and
00:14 - start with multiplying a polom by a
00:17 - monomial now if you remember polinomial
00:20 - is an expression with many terms and a
00:24 - monomial only has one term so we've
00:27 - talked about this property before
00:30 - that's called the distributive property
00:32 - and that's how we are going to multiply
00:36 - the polinomial by the
00:39 - monomial so when we learn our order of
00:43 - operations we learn that you have to do
00:45 - what's inside parentheses
00:48 - first so if I was to combine all
00:52 - this and then multiply by this the
00:56 - distributive property tells me that that
00:58 - is the same thing as taking this first
01:01 - term and multiplying it by every single
01:06 - term inside the parentheses now we've
01:10 - used this before when subtracting pols
01:14 - in order to distribute that negative to
01:17 - each term so we're going to do the same
01:20 - thing so I'm going to write it out the
01:23 - Long Way first but you don't have to do
01:25 - this every time this is just for
01:28 - practice so I'm going to take this this
01:31 - term *
01:34 - 9 plus -28 2 *
01:41 - 8 * a excuse me and then -2 a 2 * -4 a
01:50 - 2 so we're still going to have the same
01:54 - amount of terms that we started with
01:56 - we're just going to have different ones
01:58 - so -2 * * 9 is -8 so we have -8 a^ 2 +
02:06 - -2 * 1 is going to be a positive 2 a
02:12 - cubed because remember when we multiply
02:15 - Powers we add them so this is if you
02:18 - remember an understood one up here so we
02:21 - take 2 + 1 and we get a to the 3 and
02:26 - then plus -2 * -4 which is going to be
02:30 - positive and 2 * 4 is 8 8 to the 4th now
02:36 - remember I got 8 to the 4 not by
02:39 - multiplying 2 * 2 but adding 2 * 2 + 2
02:45 - so this is our new
02:49 - expression so we're going to do a couple
02:51 - more examples until you get the hang of
02:54 - this so now I draw the arrows just so
02:57 - that you guys see
03:00 - exactly what I'm doing but you don't
03:01 - have to do that every time you do this
03:03 - if you just know what you're doing
03:06 - that's that's fine so this time I'm not
03:08 - going to write out each term multiplied
03:10 - I'm just going to multiply them so 2 * a
03:14 - 1 gives us 2 x^ 2 * x to the 3r gives us
03:20 - x to the 5th - 2 * 2 is 4 x to
03:27 - 4th + 2 *
03:31 - 8 16 x to the 3r - 10 x^
03:39 - s and do the same thing down here now if
03:43 - you notice this time our monomial is on
03:46 - the left but that really doesn't change
03:49 - anything at all because we're still
03:51 - going to distribute that -3 the same way
03:54 - we
03:56 - do
03:58 - in when it's on to on the right but what
04:02 - I'm going to do just because we always
04:04 - do our math right to left I'm going to
04:07 - start with this 6X you can start with
04:10 - the eight that's fine you just have to
04:12 - make sure that each sign goes with the
04:14 - correct thing that it's supposed to go
04:16 - with so -3x * 6X is going to give us a
04:23 - -8x squared cuz 1 + 1 is
04:28 - 25 cuz remember this is
04:30 - plus
04:31 - a55 * -3 is going to give us a positive
04:35 - 15 and I know that looks like a x but or
04:39 - that looked like a y but it was supposed
04:41 - to be an x
04:45 - x2+ x to the 1 or times x to the 1 is
04:48 - given to give us x to the 3r minus and
04:53 - it's minus because a negative * a
04:54 - positive is a negative so -3 * 8 is
04:59 - going to give
05:00 - 24 x we have one more example we're
05:04 - going to
05:08 - do okay so this one you might get a
05:12 - little scared about but it's the same
05:16 - thing that we did before we're still
05:19 - going to
05:23 - distribute the only difference is that
05:27 - we add the like powers together so I'm
05:30 - going to write this out just because
05:31 - this one's the first one like this we've
05:33 - done so * 8
05:38 - cubed
05:40 - plus a b^
05:43 - s
05:45 - oh
05:47 - sorry * -2 a 2 B okay so when we
05:53 - multiply these two we're going to
05:55 - multiply
05:56 - the each little
05:59 - um similar term together so what we
06:03 - multiply is we're going to multiply that
06:05 - -3 by the understood one out in front of
06:08 - that a so you're going to still get
06:10 - negative 3 and then we multiply a by a
06:14 - cubed so a to the 1st * a cubed is going
06:19 - to give us a to the 4th and b^ 2 * b^2
06:24 - is going to give us B to 4th and this is
06:27 - going to be plus we have
06:30 - -3 * -2 is going to be POS 6 a * a 2 is
06:35 - a the 3r b^ 2 * B is B to the
06:41 - 3 so when we
06:44 - do when we have a monomial that has more
06:47 - than one variable in it we just make
06:49 - sure that we
06:51 - add the right exponents together and say
06:55 - that this had like a A plus b and we had
07:00 - to do -3 a b^ 2 *
07:04 - B we would and of course this would be
07:07 - inside the
07:08 - parentheses all we would do is we' keep
07:10 - the -3 and a because there's no other a
07:13 - to multiply it by and this becomes B to
07:16 - the
07:17 - 3 so that's all we have to do with
07:20 - multiplying today but make sure you come
07:22 - back and watch our next lesson because
07:23 - we're going to kick it up a little bit
07:25 - and multiply pols
07:28 - together for
