00:00 - alright guys so now that we got the
00:01 - basic functions taken care of to handle
00:04 - and unpack just a simple ethernet frame
00:07 - what we can do now is we can start
00:08 - working on our main function so this is
00:11 - essentially our main program and all
00:13 - it's going to do is it's essentially
00:15 - just going to be a big loop and this
00:19 - loop is just going to run forever as
00:20 - long as their programs running and it's
00:22 - just going to sit and listen for packets
00:25 - to come in so it's just going to keep
00:26 - looping looping forever waiting for
00:29 - packets to come in and whenever they do
00:31 - we're pretty much going to extract all
00:33 - the information from it and display it
00:35 - to the user or do whatever we want with
00:37 - it so that is what we're doing
00:41 - essentially and before we can actually
00:44 - start that loop we're just going to make
00:46 - a simple socket so we need a socket of
00:49 - course so we can have connections with
00:50 - other computers so I'm just going to
00:53 - call it connection will sockets dot
00:59 - socket and if you guys don't know about
01:02 - sockets or anything like that then I
01:05 - recommend you check out my Python and
01:07 - reverse shell tutorials or there's
01:10 - another Python series I made recently
01:11 - I'm talking about sockets but there's
01:16 - kind of a lot to cover but I talked
01:17 - about it all in that so all right so the
01:20 - first one is just AF just the packet and
01:24 - suck it where you add just a raw data
01:32 - and suck it dot in T just three art so
01:38 - if you guys know about sockets then and
01:41 - if you watch my other tutorial series
01:42 - you know what those first two arguments
01:45 - are this is the last one I actually
01:46 - didn't talk about this last one make
01:49 - sure that it's compatible with all
01:50 - machines again making sure that
01:53 - big-endian little-endian converting it
01:56 - properly pretty much making sure the
01:58 - byte order is correct so we can read it
02:00 - so after this once we have just a raw
02:04 - socket we can go ahead and start our
02:06 - main loop now remember our main loop and
02:09 - actually
02:10 - go ahead and call Maine now so I don't
02:11 - forget it alright so again what our main
02:18 - loop is going to do is it's just it's
02:20 - just going to keep looping and looping
02:21 - an infinite loop looping forever and
02:24 - just going to listen for any data that
02:27 - comes across now once it comes across
02:29 - we're going to take raw data and make
02:33 - that variable and also the address and
02:36 - we're just going to write receive from
02:39 - and the biggest buffer size that you can
02:41 - have is 65535 so basically that's what
02:45 - we're doing we're taking our socket
02:47 - whenever it gets something whenever it
02:50 - sees information we're just going to go
02:52 - ahead and receive it all and then we're
02:54 - going to store it in the variable data
02:56 - and address and why is this indentation
03:00 - go ahead and format that alright are you
03:04 - freaking happy now art so that's what
03:06 - we're going to do and remember this is
03:08 - just the address of wherever it's
03:11 - sending to or the source and this is the
03:14 - actual data that we're going to be
03:15 - passing into ethernet frame so remember
03:18 - this function right here is going to
03:20 - unpack it all and pretty much give us
03:23 - the cool information of whatever we want
03:25 - so remember the Ethernet frame it
03:29 - returns four different chunks returns
03:33 - the destination the source the Ethernet
03:37 - type or Ethernet protocol and the actual
03:39 - payload or the cool stuff inside so what
03:43 - we can do from here is just write
03:45 - something like that's the MAC and source
03:49 - MAC and then what am I going to call
03:53 - this let's just call this a 'if proto
03:57 - and the actual data so now we can go
04:03 - ahead I'm not that lazy all right so
04:08 - Ethernet frame raw data all right so
04:13 - again what we're doing is taking that
04:15 - data that comes across the network and
04:16 - that's just the pulses of ones and zeros
04:18 - passing it to our function and we're
04:20 - going to extract all of that stuff and
04:23 - store it in nice awesome variables that
04:25 - we can use so now let's go ahead and
04:28 - make sure that this works up to this
04:30 - point by printing something out so let
04:33 - me just print out like a Ethernet frame
04:41 - oops knocked over my mouse I actually
04:44 - have a vertical mouse if you guys look
04:48 - on like Google Images type in vertical
04:50 - mouse it's like this weird tall mouse
04:52 - but I need to use it because I started
04:54 - having like carpal tunnel symptoms so
04:56 - I'm sure no one cares about that so I'm
04:59 - just going to keep going on methods
05:01 - order now all right
05:02 - so for this what we can do is we can
05:05 - just print out the destination the
05:07 - source in the protocol because we're
05:08 - going to be dealing with the data later
05:10 - because there's a bunch of stuff we need
05:11 - to do to it so I'll just write
05:15 - destination and then I write source then
05:26 - I'll write to proto who is sexting me in
05:31 - the middle of my video art so I'm just
05:33 - going to format this in the video for
05:37 - min all right so if you guys never seen
05:45 - these curly braces before basically
05:47 - they're just placeholders and you can
05:49 - format it in kind of weird ways but what
05:52 - I'm doing is I'm just going to have
05:53 - placeholders right here and what's going
05:55 - to go in these placeholders well just
05:58 - whatever you wrote right here remember
06:00 - in this point the MAC addresses are
06:02 - properly formatted already thanks to
06:05 - this function right here so what I'm
06:08 - going to do is I'm going to go ahead and
06:09 - let me go ahead and open a browser and
06:11 - refresh some page and check it out
06:16 - all right so right now what we did is we
06:19 - extracted the destiny
06:21 - the source and the protocol so this
06:26 - protocol right here this 8 that's the
06:30 - one that we're really concerned about
06:31 - because that's just normal um what you
06:34 - would think of is just like normal
06:36 - Internet traffic so that's where we're
06:38 - going to be focus on focusing on but
06:40 - right now it looks like everything is
06:42 - working fine but now that the boring
06:44 - Ethernet data is taken care of what we
06:47 - can do is we can start breaking up the
06:49 - main payload and start trying to figure
06:52 - out what websites they're going to what
06:54 - information they typed in you know whose
06:56 - Facebook profile they were looking at
06:58 - all that fun stuff
06:59 - so that's what we have to look forward
07:01 - to I will see you guys in the next video
