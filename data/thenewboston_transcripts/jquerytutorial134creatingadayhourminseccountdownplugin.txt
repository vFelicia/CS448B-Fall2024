00:00 - the only issue in this tutorial and the
00:02 - thing I'm not going to be covering is
00:03 - the esses so for example if it was one
00:05 - day you wouldn't want this s suffix
00:07 - you'd just want one day but you know I'm
00:11 - not going to include that in the
00:11 - tutorial that's probably something you
00:13 - can go ahead and do in your own time
00:14 - just sort of give you a little challenge
00:17 - so now that we've done this form we
00:19 - don't really need to touch anything on
00:21 - this main page because ext doc J s is
00:23 - gonna call the countdown plug-in and
00:26 - it's going to apply it to this countdown
00:28 - div so let's go ahead and inside here we
00:31 - want to say document dot ready and
00:34 - remember this is the file that's just
00:36 - gonna be calling our plugin as opposed
00:38 - to actually you know performing this
00:40 - functionality so document and we're
00:42 - appending the ready Handler once this is
00:44 - ready we're gonna run everything inside
00:45 - of here and that is selecting our
00:48 - countdown div using the hash because
00:50 - we're selecting by ID we're gonna say
00:53 - countdown dot and then countdown now
00:56 - countdown is the name of our plugin for
00:59 - now I'm not going to specify any options
01:01 - or a callback function in here we're
01:03 - gonna do that I each each stage of
01:05 - creating our plug-in itself so we'll
01:08 - leave that for just a moment now let's
01:11 - go over to countdown jQuery j/s and
01:13 - actually start creating the plug-in now
01:16 - notice that I've got this included here
01:17 - and then I've got ext no js' included
01:20 - here as well just make sure that this
01:22 - one here comes after jQuery because
01:24 - obviously it needs to take advantage of
01:26 - jQuery so let's go ahead and start to
01:29 - outline our function if you've already
01:30 - looked at creating functions this will
01:32 - be quite you know for me you'll be quite
01:34 - familiar with the code here but what
01:36 - we're essentially saying is function in
01:38 - brackets entirely with the dollar sign
01:40 - here this is just the notation that
01:42 - we're going to be using and inside these
01:44 - curly brackets which we're going to
01:46 - bring down we're going to give a name to
01:48 - our function and create everything to do
01:50 - with it however just after here we want
01:52 - to say jQuery and this allows us to use
01:56 - notation in a different way for example
01:58 - dollar sign dot f n dot and then our
02:02 - function name so before we would have to
02:05 - use jQuery like this here we can just
02:07 - use a dollar sign so dollar sign dot F N
02:10 - and we want to call our function
02:12 - remember countdown so that's quite basic
02:14 - we just write countdown it tells us what
02:16 - we want to do etc and what we're going
02:19 - to do is we're not going to supply prime
02:21 - parentheses sorry what we're going to do
02:23 - is we're going to say equals function
02:26 - now everything inside of here will be
02:29 - our plugin code so at the moment what I
02:32 - want to go ahead and do is just alert
02:34 - out working now what's going to happen
02:38 - is inside ext dot J s because we're
02:40 - making use of this plugin as long as
02:43 - we've declared everything properly we'll
02:45 - just have an alert box come out so let's
02:48 - refresh and you can see that we've got
02:49 - the alert box working so we know that
02:51 - our plugin declaration is working and we
02:54 - can go ahead and start to write the rest
02:55 - of our code now the first thing we want
02:58 - to do is and allow the user to give some
03:01 - options into this and that option is
03:03 - specifying the date that they want to
03:04 - count down to so we're gonna be using
03:07 - date dot parse and this is going to take
03:09 - a string date and it's going to convert
03:12 - it into a timestamp so for example I
03:15 - could write the 10th of August 2011 at
03:21 - 12 o'clock and 30 seconds just as an
03:26 - example this would be a way that we
03:27 - could write our a date that which would
03:29 - then be converted into a timestamp so we
03:32 - want to allow the user to specify this
03:33 - date inside the plugin as we call it so
03:37 - let's go ahead and just inside of here
03:38 - choose an options parameter now we want
03:43 - to go ahead and set a list of settings
03:45 - that we can merge with these options and
03:47 - these will be this will be an array of
03:49 - default values that we apply to each
03:51 - option that we allow our user to give so
03:54 - I'm going to create a an array called
03:58 - settings and inside here the I'm gonna
04:00 - say date and the default value is going
04:03 - to be null because I want the user to
04:05 - actually be able to specify a date I
04:07 - don't want this countdown script to work
04:10 - if I don't if we don't specify a date
04:13 - and later on we're gonna do a check to
04:16 - see if this date value is equal to a
04:18 - number or if it's not n a n in
04:21 - JavaScript and a
04:22 - and like written like this with capital
04:24 - N and capital in here which stands for
04:26 - not a number so we want to make sure
04:27 - that this date is a number as well
04:29 - however we'll be handling the validation
04:32 - a bit later okay so now we want to
04:35 - extend these settings into our options
04:37 - where essentially what we're doing is
04:39 - taking options from the user and if they
04:41 - do exist we are merging them with this
04:44 - here so we'll essentially just be
04:46 - merging the date this string here into
04:50 - this value here so date then equals the
04:52 - right you know setting so we're gonna
04:55 - say if options I has the user specified
04:57 - any options at all
04:59 - so here and I'm doing all this all in
05:01 - one line but feel free to bring it down
05:03 - and indent it if you wish I'll probably
05:05 - go ahead and do that just so we looks a
05:07 - bit better then we're gonna say dollar
05:09 - sign again using dollar sign as opposed
05:11 - to jQuery because this is how we set up
05:14 - our function so dollar sign dot extend
05:18 - and we want to choose our array and then
05:21 - the options that we've passed in so this
05:24 - is settings and options so we've now
05:27 - extended our settings to our options and
05:30 - we've merged the value here and replace
05:33 - this null value here so now what we can
05:35 - do is access our settings through that
05:38 - array so down here I'm just going to go
05:40 - ahead and alert out settings and because
05:42 - we're using an array we need to cut
05:44 - square brackets and I'm gonna say date
05:47 - so we're getting this value here that's
05:49 - been merged with the options that we've
05:51 - passed through let's go ahead and
05:52 - refresh and you can see that we have
05:54 - that string or that yeah that string
05:56 - dates there
