00:00 - we're going to be
00:02 - proving that triangles are congruent
00:05 - today using two of the five basic
00:10 - methods the first is side side side and
00:13 - the second is side angle side so the
00:17 - first
00:18 - one side side side is when you
00:22 - have three sides of one
00:24 - triangle congruent to three sides of
00:27 - another triangle so here we know that
00:29 - this side is congruent to this side this
00:32 - side's congruent to this side this
00:34 - side's congruent to this
00:38 - side
00:42 - therefore we're going to call this
00:44 - triangle a and this triangle
00:46 - B triangle a is congruent to Triangle
00:53 - B so then the next one we're going to
00:57 - talk about is called side angle side
01:00 - or for short
01:02 - SAS two sides and the included angle of
01:06 - one triangle are congruent to two sides
01:09 - in the included angle of another
01:11 - triangle so this part right here
01:17 - the the included angle is really
01:22 - important it has to be the included
01:24 - angle so for these two triangles I know
01:27 - that this side is equal to this side
01:30 - this side is congruent to this side and
01:33 - I know that this angle which is between
01:36 - these two
01:38 - sides and this angle between these two
01:41 - sides are both right
01:47 - angles they don't have to be right
01:49 - angles like if you were trying to prove
01:52 - other triangles were congruent and you
01:55 - just knew that they were their angles
01:57 - were equal that's all that matters you
02:00 - don't have to know the right triangles
02:02 - or right angles but we know that because
02:05 - right
02:06 - angles equal
02:09 - 90° they these two angles have to be
02:12 - congruent because they both measure
02:15 - 90° so knowing that these three things
02:20 - two sides in the included angle we're
02:22 - going to call this a and this B
02:25 - therefore we can say that triangle a is
02:29 - congruent to Triangle
02:32 - B so let's do some
02:35 - examples so we're going
02:38 - to um State whether these triangles are
02:42 - congruent and if they are congruent
02:44 - we're going to say whether it was by
02:47 - side side side or side angle side if we
02:50 - find that these triangles aren't
02:52 - congruent we're just going to put
02:55 - neither so first we have these two
02:58 - triangles and I have this side congruent
03:01 - to this side this side congruent to this
03:05 - side and these two sides
03:06 - congruent so
03:09 - therefore there triangle one is
03:12 - congruent to Triangle
03:14 - two by side side
03:19 - side I can now I'm going to look at this
03:23 - one I know this side is congruent to
03:26 - this
03:27 - side this side is congruent to this side
03:29 - so so far we have two congruent
03:32 - sides but if you look this
03:36 - angle is the included angle of this of
03:40 - these two sides but this angle over here
03:44 - is not the included angle for us to
03:47 - prove that these are
03:48 - congruent we'd have to know that this
03:50 - one is
03:52 - congruent
03:54 - to to this
03:57 - one but since we don't know that
04:00 - we have to
04:02 - say neither now this doesn't mean the
04:06 - triangles aren't congruent this just
04:09 - means that we can't prove that they
04:14 - are so we went over the first two ways
04:18 - to prove triangles are congruent so make
04:21 - sure you come back and watch the next
04:22 - video and we're going to talk about two
04:24 - other ways to prove triangles are
04:26 - congruent called angle side Ang angle
04:30 - and angle angle
04:32 - side
