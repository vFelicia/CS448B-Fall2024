00:01 - welcome back guys to your second C++
00:04 - tutorial and in this tutorial we are
00:07 - finally going to begin writing some code
00:10 - and what we're going to be doing is
00:11 - actually building a basic program and
00:15 - all this program is going to do is just
00:16 - output basic text to the screen but it's
00:18 - very essential in understanding the
00:20 - basics of how a C++ program is put
00:24 - together and all the pieces you need to
00:26 - have in place in order to run even the
00:28 - most basic progr
00:30 - so there is my introduction I hope you
00:33 - guys enjoyed let's begin shall we so the
00:36 - first thing that we need to do is this
00:38 - hit the number sign and press i n c u d
00:42 - and move my cursor out of the way I O S
00:46 - eam and make sure it's in between your
00:49 - less than and greater than sign now what
00:52 - we're doing with this line of code is
00:55 - again we're going to be talking about
00:57 - include files and header files later on
01:00 - but for those of you guys who just need
01:01 - to know what we're doing is adding a
01:05 - pre-processor directive and in essence
01:08 - what that means is we're going to
01:10 - include important files that are all
01:13 - already built into C++ and these files
01:15 - are going to help us later on but for
01:17 - now this line isn't really important
01:20 - pretty much including files that we're
01:21 - going to need later on so with that
01:24 - being said let's go ahead and build our
01:27 - first function and before I Even build
01:30 - my first function let me explain to you
01:32 - guys what a function is every single C++
01:36 - program is made up of of functions if
01:40 - you don't have a function then you don't
01:42 - have a C++ program and check this out
01:45 - the main function that your computer is
01:48 - going to look for is called main hm how
01:52 - convenient not the state the word m a i
01:55 - n and for those of you guys who think
01:57 - that m a i n is how you spell the state
02:00 - and yeah spell it like the State but
02:02 - anyways let's go ahead and build our
02:04 - very first function go ahead and arrate
02:07 - int m a i n and hit two empty
02:11 - parentheses now this is pretty much
02:14 - called what do I say pretty much it's
02:16 - not pretty much this is called the
02:18 - function header but I often call it the
02:20 - title because you know it's kind of like
02:22 - the title here's your function name
02:25 - right there Main and here is the data
02:29 - type it returns
02:30 - but we'll be covering data types later
02:32 - on this pretty much is short for integer
02:35 - so anyways we have a title of the
02:37 - function which technically it's called
02:40 - the header so now that it has a head we
02:44 - need to give it a body and in order to
02:46 - do that go ahead and add two little
02:48 - curly brackets and some space in between
02:52 - so here is the basics of how any
02:54 - computer program works as soon as you
02:57 - start your program it's going to look
02:59 - for for a function called main so that's
03:02 - what we're building right here so that's
03:04 - why you need to name this main because
03:08 - again like I said it's the very first
03:10 - function your computer is going to look
03:12 - for whenever it starts running the
03:14 - program and inside your function you're
03:17 - going to tell your computer exactly what
03:20 - to do inside of your function you're
03:22 - going to have something called
03:23 - statements and what a statement is is
03:26 - it's pretty much an instruction so
03:30 - your program is probably going to be
03:32 - made up of well in this program is
03:34 - probably going to be made up of you know
03:37 - six different statements or six
03:39 - different instructions and these are
03:41 - basic instructions of what we want our
03:44 - computer programed to do simple enough
03:47 - so with that being said let's go ahead
03:49 - and add one of these statements right
03:51 - now again just like this include right
03:55 - here there's something else that you
03:57 - absolutely need your computer program
04:00 - to have let's go ahead and add
04:02 - using
04:05 - namespace I'll get it right
04:08 - STD and this means using namespace
04:12 - sexual transmitted disease all right
04:14 - next line I'm just kidding all right
04:17 - this actually means using namespace
04:19 - standard and what this means again we're
04:23 - be covering Nam spaces and uh you know
04:26 - all this stuff later on but for those of
04:27 - you guys who just need to know what this
04:29 - means means we're going to be using all
04:31 - of the basic standard functions in our
04:34 - program simple enough all right so now
04:37 - we can finally begin getting to the meat
04:39 - of this tutorial and that's how to print
04:43 - basic text out on the screen and this is
04:46 - how you do it
04:48 - cut hit space and hit the less sign two
04:52 - times and then go ahead and inside
04:54 - quotation marks type whatever you want
04:57 - to print out so I will write my name is
05:00 - Bucky and you need to end every
05:03 - statement with a
05:04 - semicolon since whenever you give your
05:07 - computer a bunch of different statements
05:08 - or instructions it needs to know when
05:11 - the first one ends and when the second
05:13 - one begins so they aren all jum together
05:15 - jumbled together so what we do is we
05:18 - separate them by semicolons and we
05:21 - typically put them on a separate lines
05:23 - this just makes it easier for the
05:25 - programmer you and me to read so anyways
05:28 - what we said now is is my name is Bucky
05:32 - and we want to Output this to the screen
05:34 - C out is the function that allows you to
05:38 - display stuff on the screen so you know
05:42 - that's all I need to say so let's go
05:44 - ahead and let's go ahead and teach you
05:47 - guys about one other thing and this is
05:49 - how to make a new line and that's see
05:51 - out of course print out to the screen
05:54 - and don't put this in quotation marks
05:56 - put e n d l this means n line and this
06:00 - is the exact equivalent of hitting enter
06:03 - or return on your keyboard it moves your
06:06 - text down a line so now that we're on
06:09 - the next line of our program let's just
06:11 - go ahead and output something El so we
06:13 - actually see this baby in action and
06:15 - let's just go ahead and write my let's
06:18 - go ahead and write I have an overactive
06:21 - bladder and make sure you spell it wrong
06:23 - or else your program is not going to
06:25 - work just kidding but anyways and you
06:28 - were saying Bucky why you tell me about
06:29 - your bladder well guys if you're going
06:31 - to be watching your tutorials with me
06:33 - then uh you know we're going to have to
06:35 - get to know each other so the first
06:37 - thing I want you guys to know about me
06:38 - is I have an overacted bladder so there
06:41 - you go and let's just go ahead and add
06:44 - one other end line so see out end line
06:47 - so now we have a program that prints out
06:50 - a line of text that says my name is
06:51 - Bucky and on the next line when we move
06:54 - down it says I have an overactive
06:56 - bladder and then just hit the enter key
06:59 - again that's what it's going to look
07:00 - like so now we're not exactly ready to
07:03 - run this program yet what we need to do
07:07 - is system and in parenthesis go ahead
07:10 - and type
07:11 - pause what this is going to do is
07:14 - actually pause your program because if
07:16 - you don't have this line your program is
07:18 - going to run super fast and exit before
07:20 - you even get to see anything at all and
07:22 - I'll run this without this line to show
07:24 - you guys what exactly is going on and
07:26 - the very last statement or instruction
07:30 - we need to give our function main is
07:33 - return Z and you're saying all right
07:36 - what's this return zero is just your way
07:39 - of telling the main function that
07:42 - everything went according to plan check
07:46 - this out let me give you guys a little
07:47 - preview in the future this int means
07:51 - whenever we use this function it's
07:53 - expecting an integer in return and built
07:58 - in your computer computer your computer
08:00 - knows already whenever it returns zero
08:03 - it means everything went according to
08:05 - plan so that's why it's an end of all of
08:08 - our main functions we return zero and
08:10 - that's just our way of telling the
08:12 - computer everything went according to
08:14 - plan we're cool we're cool man all right
08:17 - so now like I said that is our program
08:21 - in order to run this here's what you
08:22 - need to do execute compile and run
08:26 - compile means change this code in code
08:28 - that we can understand to ones and zeros
08:30 - that the computer can understand and run
08:32 - this program so check that out my name
08:35 - is Bucky I have an overactive bladder
08:37 - and you can either X out of that or just
08:39 - hit any button and it'll X out now check
08:42 - this out let's go ahead and get rid of
08:44 - this system pause and see what happens
08:47 - execute compile and
08:49 - run I don't know if you guys saw that
08:51 - but what it did is pretty much just
08:53 - flashed on the screen real quick and
08:55 - exited so that is why we need
09:00 - that system pause right there so I mean
09:02 - we're not as fast as a computer we can't
09:04 - read that quick we need to pause
09:06 - everything so we can actually see our
09:08 - work and you know look at it take a
09:12 - breath of fresh air and be proud of
09:14 - something so that's why we need system
09:16 - pause like I said so anyways that's all
09:18 - I have for you guys for this tutorial
09:20 - this is the very Basics bear bones of
09:23 - how we create a program in C++ now we
09:27 - can begin going into the uh uh you know
09:30 - the detail stuff a little more you know
09:33 - more about uh I I don't know I don't
09:35 - even know what I'm saying right now what
09:37 - I want to say though is if you want any
09:39 - of this code then go ahead and click in
09:40 - the link below and I'll save it for you
09:43 - guys all on my Forum so just go ahead
09:45 - and copy it and uh throw it in your
09:47 - program if you guys are lazy but anyways
09:49 - thank you guys for watching uh don't
09:50 - forget to subscribe don't forget to
09:52 - check out the next video and I'll see
09:53 - you guys later
