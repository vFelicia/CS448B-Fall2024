00:00 - what is going on guys welcome to your
00:01 - second UDK tutorial and in this tutorial
00:03 - I'm going to be talking about navigation
00:06 - how to move around our 3d world so
00:08 - before our unit started with that I want
00:10 - to mention this whenever you first open
00:12 - the UDK your computer screen may or may
00:15 - not look like my computer screen right
00:17 - now if it looks like this and you have
00:19 - one big window right here fine leave it
00:22 - like that but if your computer screen
00:23 - looks like this and you have four big
00:25 - boxes on your screen and this one is you
00:28 - know minimize to the bottom left we want
00:30 - to change that so for the sake of this
00:32 - tutorial I'm just going to teaching you
00:34 - guys how to maximize this view right
00:36 - here I'm not going to be talking about
00:37 - what all these menus and buttons mean
00:39 - I'm going to be covering all these
00:40 - buttons in the upcoming tutorials but
00:42 - for now for the sake of this story I'll
00:44 - just follow along with what I tell you
00:46 - to do in the top right corner you're
00:49 - going to see this little square right
00:50 - here go ahead and click that and by the
00:52 - way if you guys are just itching to know
00:54 - these big boxes right here are called
00:56 - viewports they're basically different
00:58 - views or different angles from which you
01:01 - can view your object so you know I know
01:04 - you guys are probably itching to know
01:05 - what those big boxes were so we're going
01:07 - to be working in this one right here so
01:09 - go ahead and click this button right
01:10 - here
01:11 - and this is going to maximize this view
01:13 - it's exactly like maximizing a window if
01:15 - you you know use windows so now that we
01:18 - have this view maximized we can begin
01:20 - learning how to navigate around our
01:22 - viewport so before I even get started
01:25 - with that you're going to mention you're
01:27 - going to see one thing first of all this
01:29 - view is pretty boring it's just a red
01:31 - cube and you know a bunch of black in
01:34 - blue lines not very exciting so let's go
01:37 - ahead and get something more exciting to
01:39 - work with now whenever you download it
01:41 - and install the UDK it came with a bunch
01:44 - of maps now these are maps that we
01:46 - didn't build these are maps that whoever
01:48 - made the UDK they build them so let's go
01:50 - ahead and use a map and then we can you
01:52 - know learn navigation in that instead of
01:55 - this huge black world with blue lines
01:57 - and you know a red box it's a lot more
01:59 - exciting so in order to open a map go
02:02 - ahead and go to file open and by default
02:06 - it's going to give you the list maps
02:07 - that come with the UDK it doesn't really
02:10 - matter what map you choose and you might
02:12 - not even have this map because
02:13 - depending on what version of the UDK you
02:15 - downloaded you may have different Maps
02:18 - but go ahead and open any map my
02:20 - favorite map is V CTF and necropolis so
02:22 - I'm going to go ahead and hit open to
02:24 - open that and as you can see we get this
02:27 - new cool-looking map a lot better than
02:29 - you know that black world so again like
02:33 - I said I'm not going to be covering what
02:35 - any of these buttons do in this tutorial
02:36 - but I want you to click this one button
02:39 - right here with the G on it
02:40 - this means game mode so before you click
02:43 - that you probably notice that this mode
02:45 - right here has a bunch of lines in it
02:47 - and has a bunch of lights and this is
02:50 - kind of the designer view we don't need
02:53 - the designer view for the sake of this
02:54 - tutorial we're just learning how to move
02:56 - around so go ahead and hit this G button
02:58 - and as you can see we have now entered
03:00 - game mode this is what someone would see
03:03 - if they were playing the game so now
03:06 - that we have our view maximized in
03:08 - wearing game mode we can begin learning
03:11 - what I will finally want to teach you
03:12 - guys in this tutorial and that's a
03:13 - navigation how to move around the school
03:15 - map how to move around the 3d world so
03:18 - the first thing I want to teach you guys
03:20 - is the left mouse button what happens
03:23 - when you hold it what happens when you
03:24 - drag it go ahead and click your left
03:26 - mouse button and drag it up and drag it
03:31 - down and drag it to the left and drag it
03:34 - to the right as you can see what the
03:37 - left mouse button does whenever you
03:38 - click it and drag it it allows you to
03:41 - move around kind of in a flat plane kind
03:44 - of like if you're walking or driving the
03:46 - car or it basically allows you to move
03:49 - left right forward and back so that's
03:52 - what the left mouse button does whenever
03:54 - you hold it so now let's go ahead and
03:56 - venture over to the right mouse button
03:58 - whenever you hold down the right mouse
04:00 - button and start moving around with your
04:02 - mouse it's basically like this if you
04:05 - are standing in one place and your feet
04:07 - were glued to the ground and you're
04:08 - holding a camera you could turn that
04:10 - camera in any direction you just
04:12 - couldn't move you can't move forward
04:14 - backward you can't move left right up
04:17 - and down you can only stay in one place
04:19 - so it's basically like staying in one
04:21 - place and turning your head so again the
04:24 - left mouse button allows you to move
04:26 - forward back left and right and the
04:29 - right mouse button allows you to change
04:31 - the angle of the camera just like that
04:33 - so you're saying re that's nice and all
04:36 - but that leaves us with a couple things
04:37 - first of all how do I move up and down
04:39 - well I use my left mouse button in rice
04:42 - right mouse button I'm kind of running
04:44 - out of buttons here in order to move up
04:46 - and down what you need to do is you need
04:49 - to hold the left mouse button and the
04:51 - right mouse button at the exact same
04:53 - time and scroll up and scroll down so
04:57 - that's how you move up and down you hold
04:59 - the left and right mouse button at the
05:00 - exact same time and check it out we are
05:02 - now moving up and down so again left and
05:06 - right at the same time allow us to move
05:08 - up and down and if we move right and
05:10 - left we kind of pan left and right so
05:13 - what I think of whenever I'm using this
05:15 - mode is if my face is pressed against a
05:17 - glass window I can't go forward or
05:20 - backward I can only press it and I can
05:23 - move my head up down left and right I
05:26 - can't go through the glass or anything
05:27 - so that's kind of what I envision
05:29 - whenever I'm using this mode so with
05:32 - that being said that takes care of all
05:34 - the mouse buttons basically your left
05:36 - mouse button goes forward backward and
05:39 - turns left and right so it basically
05:41 - allows us to go anywhere on a flat plane
05:44 - the right mouse button allows us to
05:46 - change the angle both mouse buttons at
05:49 - the same time allow us to move up and
05:51 - down and also pan left and right so with
05:56 - those mouse buttons in those combination
05:58 - buttons we could basically move anywhere
05:59 - we want to move however if you guys have
06:03 - ever played the game Unreal Tournament
06:05 - or maybe you played let me think what
06:07 - other game world warcraft uses us to you
06:10 - may prefer an alternative style of
06:12 - navigation you may be familiar with the
06:14 - WASD navigation now this navigation
06:19 - allows you to use the WASD keys on your
06:21 - keyboard to move around but before you
06:23 - start clicking those keys remember this
06:26 - one thing anytime you want to use the
06:28 - WASD navigation you need to have your
06:31 - right mouse button held in and now let
06:33 - me go ahead and hold w we move forward
06:35 - if we hold s we move backward
06:39 - if we hold a move to the left and if we
06:42 - hold D we move to the right and again
06:44 - like I said this is all with my right
06:47 - mouse button held down right now I have
06:49 - my finger on my right mouse button I
06:50 - know you guys can't see it but trust me
06:52 - it's there so if you prefer this style
06:54 - of navigation is kind of like flying
06:56 - around or you know oh yeah that's it
06:59 - just flying around you can do that so
07:01 - again don't forget the whole direct
07:03 - mouse button on your mouse so with that
07:07 - being said you're saying all right what
07:08 - happens if I don't hold the right mouse
07:10 - button well let's go ahead and click W
07:12 - right now without holding the right
07:13 - mouse button check out what happens
07:15 - everything disappears so before you
07:17 - freak out and think that you messed up
07:19 - your graphics card in your computer or
07:21 - you know your computer's freaking out or
07:22 - something W is actually a hotkey for
07:26 - something called hide static meshes in
07:28 - it basically means hide 3d models that's
07:32 - all I'm going to tell you for net right
07:33 - now but just remember this w is a hotkey
07:36 - and it means something totally different
07:38 - in the UDK so make sure whenever you
07:43 - accidentally click W using this style
07:45 - navigation don't freak out it just means
07:48 - that you know you forgot to hold the
07:50 - right mouse button so again to recap one
07:53 - last time in order to move around our 3d
07:55 - world we can use the mouse buttons the
07:57 - left Mouse one goes forward and back
07:59 - left and right the right mouse button
08:01 - allows us to change the angle holding on
08:04 - both at the same time allows us to move
08:06 - up and down and pan left and right and
08:08 - if we hold the right mouse button we can
08:11 - use WASD to move around our 3d world
08:15 - just a different style of navigation so
08:18 - there you go there you have it that's
08:19 - all I'm going to cover with navigation
08:21 - there's a couple other tricks with
08:23 - navigation but I'm going to save those
08:24 - when we get into you know more advanced
08:27 - modeling so for now those are the basics
08:30 - that's how you move around so thank you
08:31 - guys for watching again go and practice
08:34 - that's the only way you can perfect this
08:35 - it's going to take some getting used to
08:36 - but trust me you'll get the hang of it
08:38 - so thank you guys for watching and don't
08:40 - forget subscribe and I'll see you guys
08:41 - in the next video
