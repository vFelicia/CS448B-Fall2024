00:00 - we come back to insert and we want to
00:03 - insert a new value in fact we'll do this
00:05 - in a query so we want to insert into
00:11 - users values so we've got our ID we've
00:19 - got ID our first name out but our using
00:22 - my password our first name in our last
00:23 - name so we've got Alex a password Alex
00:29 - and Garrett
00:31 - so let's click go now what you can see
00:34 - is oh ok alright maybe not so let's go
00:37 - back to operations hmm uh ok so I set it
00:47 - to zero it needs to be set to 1 sorry so
00:49 - click go let's come and delete this
00:54 - query I've just put in there and what
00:57 - that will do is now when we want to
00:59 - reinsert some data so insert into users
01:08 - values ID user name password first name
01:13 - surname if you set up this structure
01:15 - first what makes a lot easier to look at
01:17 - and say just enter your data so password
01:21 - Alex and Garrett let's click go now you
01:25 - can see that we've inserted it with a
01:27 - row ID hmm ok right ok um some reason
01:34 - this doesn't want to go back
01:42 - that's odd perhaps we need to delete
01:44 - before we do this so let's come into
01:47 - browse and click delete operations come
01:56 - and change this to one click go let's
02:01 - just check that's definitely been
02:02 - changed that's one
02:06 - yeah it has so let's um let's insert
02:10 - that again certainly getting lots of
02:12 - practice inserting how using this SQL so
02:17 - insert into users values OOP too many
02:24 - commas
02:25 - so we've got the username password again
02:30 - Alex and gap so let's click go
02:34 - okay so inserted row ID one so if you
02:38 - were to delete all the data in your
02:39 - table and you want to start ID one again
02:42 - then just click on the operations tab
02:43 - and you can do that from there so these
02:46 - are some of the basic queries if you
02:49 - like that we've performed to insert
02:51 - delete data and modify data and there's
02:54 - plenty more things you can do things
02:56 - that you can use joins with combinations
02:58 - of tables if you're struggling with this
03:01 - then just have a play around with it
03:04 - creating data deleting modifying just
03:10 - selecting from different places as well
03:11 - we also have things called ordering so
03:15 - we can order we can order things and
03:18 - limit things as well now let's just
03:20 - insert a few more bits of data so user
03:25 - name Billy password password and then
03:30 - Billy Karen let's insert some more say
03:37 - Dale password
03:40 - kara click go so we've got three bits of
03:45 - data in here so we're just imagining
03:47 - that we've got lots and lots of data for
03:49 - now we've got idea of one two and three
03:51 - now assuming that ID is one for Alex and
03:57 - ID is three for Dale Alex will have been
04:00 - created a lot earlier than Dale we've
04:05 - created Alex first
04:07 - then Billy then Dale because we're using
04:08 - the ideas and ordering system now it's
04:11 - probably best to use timestamps in this
04:13 - case and I have a tutorial on timestamps
04:16 - that you should go back and look at if
04:17 - you don't already know but when you're
04:19 - inserting data you should probably
04:22 - always use a field with a timestamp in
04:24 - it and therefore what you can do is you
04:26 - can order order your rows depending on
04:30 - when that row was created so when the
04:33 - row was created the timestamp will be
04:35 - will you know you'll be able to order it
04:38 - because it's just an integer just a
04:40 - large integer but for now I'm going to
04:42 - order using ID now what happens if I
04:45 - want to order this and display all users
04:48 - but in order of the last user first so I
04:51 - want Dale to be first then Billy than
04:53 - Alex now if you don't know what I mean
04:55 - I'm going to just going to show you if
04:57 - we go to select say um first name and
05:05 - the I could it's surname or last name
05:09 - let's just have a check at surname say
05:12 - first name and surname from
05:18 - users all that's going to do is select
05:22 - everything so let's just copy and paste
05:24 - that so we can use it later
05:25 - let's click go you can see that what's
05:27 - happened is is we've returned Alex
05:29 - Garrett Billy Garrett Dale Guerra now
05:32 - like I said I want to structure this so
05:34 - Dale is at the top then Billy there Alex
05:36 - for example you may have a page on your
05:38 - website that says the new like a member
05:41 - list and you want to structure your
05:43 - member list with the newest member at
05:45 - the top in this case this is ordered in
05:48 - descending we've started from the first
05:51 - user and we're just sending down what if
05:53 - we want it ascending we want to go from
05:56 - the from the last one and we want to go
06:01 - up to the top so what we do is we need
06:05 - to change our query in order to adhere
06:09 - to this so what we need to do is we need
06:11 - to do this order by and we want to order
06:14 - it by a specific column and this column
06:17 - as we've discussed is ID so order by ID
06:22 - now it's fair enough ordering by ID but
06:25 - how are we ordering now we can order by
06:28 - ascending or descending and it's written
06:31 - ASC or de SC okay so yeah de SC so I
06:40 - want to order by ascending first of all
06:43 - I'm going to click go and you can see
06:47 - that it's um it's a order date in
06:50 - ascending order now if I want to descend
06:53 - from Dale to Alex all I need to do is
06:56 - make a simple edit to my query and I
06:59 - want to say order descending in capitals
07:02 - so we can see what we're doing
07:03 - so I'm now ordering it in descending
07:06 - order so if we click go you can see that
07:09 - Dale's at the top then Billy then Alex
07:12 - so like I said this could be important
07:15 - for something a list that you want to
07:17 - order in a specific order
07:18 - you could be ordering by say a price or
07:21 - you could be ordering by a date that
07:24 - comment was made so if you had a comment
07:26 - system on your website
07:27 - you'd be storing comments in a table
07:29 - you'd assign the dates to a field called
07:31 - times
07:32 - and then you can order by that time so
07:35 - there's many uses for things like
07:36 - ordering so now what happens if I only
07:39 - want to show the first two recently
07:42 - registered users which in this case
07:44 - would be dial and Billy I can use this
07:46 - thing called limit the limit keyword so
07:50 - order by ID descending space limit and
07:55 - then a number so limit 3 limit to limit
07:58 - 1 if you had lots of records you can say
08:00 - limit hundred so I'm going to limit by 2
08:02 - so simple as that limit space to
08:05 - remember your space after you're
08:07 - descending as well so we don't need any
08:09 - sort of commas or anything in between
08:12 - these we just need spaces so now what
08:16 - we're doing is we're order it with
08:18 - selecting the first name in the surname
08:19 - from users we're ordering by the ID in
08:22 - descending limits or the so from the
08:24 - most recently inserted row to the least
08:27 - M or the first I guess and then we're
08:29 - limiting by 2 so by clicking this we can
08:32 - go you can see that we're only returning
08:34 - the first two rows so I think that's
08:38 - about all for the most basic queries
08:41 - things like that that we're going to be
08:42 - using on a regular basis you will pick
08:44 - up more as we go along especially inside
08:46 - PHP when we need to do things like joins
08:49 - but for now that's basic queries and
08:52 - I've demonstrated this in PHP myadmin
08:53 - which is a really good place to mess
08:55 - around and try things out in an
08:57 - environment where you can visualize
08:59 - things rather than going straight into
09:00 - PHP so if you visualize this first and
09:04 - have a play around as soon as you
09:05 - understand it then we can proceed to
09:07 - doing this but inside PHP
