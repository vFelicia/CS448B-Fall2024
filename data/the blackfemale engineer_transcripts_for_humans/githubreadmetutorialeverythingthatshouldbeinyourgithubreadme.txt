00:00 - hello everybody my name is nyan i'm the
00:02 - black female engineer
00:04 - i provide content for new and aspiring
00:06 - software engineers
00:07 - and today we're going to be talking
00:09 - about github
00:10 - readme now if this is not your first
00:12 - video you know make sure you hit that
00:14 - subscribe button it really helps me out
00:15 - really helps support my channel
00:17 - and so also make sure you follow me on
00:19 - instagram you can engage with me more
00:20 - there and so
00:21 - yeah let's just build this community now
00:24 - the github
00:25 - project we're going to be working with
00:26 - is an old project of mine while it's
00:28 - going through coding boot camp
00:30 - it's called piggy for piggy bank
00:33 - it was a financial literacy uh
00:37 - like web app where people would track
00:39 - their expenses and then see like
00:41 - a chart auto populate of the proportions
00:44 - of
00:45 - you know their expenses going to wear
00:47 - and all of that
00:48 - so yeah we're going to work with that so
00:51 - let's get to it so this is what our
00:55 - readme is going to look like we're going
00:58 - to go into
00:59 - very deep detail about how to make it
01:01 - look like this
01:02 - but i wanted to show you what the end
01:04 - result is
01:07 - code examples picky features
01:10 - status why contact and
01:13 - license
01:18 - so let's scroll back up and click
01:21 - on yeah click on edit
01:25 - you all would have a blank like default
01:29 - readme that github would have
01:31 - created automatically after you create a
01:33 - repo
01:34 - it would have just like just default
01:36 - stuff and so
01:38 - you'd click this pencil
01:41 - button to edit it
01:47 - so right away the first thing we want to
01:50 - do
01:51 - is tell people what this app is what is
01:53 - the title of your app
01:55 - and you know make that the first thing
01:57 - they see and so we do that in github by
02:00 - putting this you know hashtag pound
02:03 - symbol
02:04 - um and then followed by a space and then
02:08 - the title you want your audience to see
02:11 - so for me that was piggy web app front
02:13 - end
02:14 - i've also done it where it's just the
02:17 - name of the app and front end
02:20 - i always make sure it says front end or
02:22 - back and because for me
02:24 - i never have combined projects i make
02:26 - sure that there's always
02:28 - a separation of concern that's really
02:31 - for me the most efficient way to develop
02:34 - and so
02:35 - my repos always say front end or back
02:37 - end and so
02:39 - there that was and then there's the
02:40 - table of contents
02:42 - so in github your headers start with a
02:46 - pound
02:46 - or one hashtag and then your sub headers
02:49 - are two hashtags
02:50 - and so everything else in here are two
02:52 - hashtags
02:53 - and the next thing i put here are the
02:56 - table of contents
02:57 - so that people can very quickly from the
03:00 - get-go
03:00 - know what to expect out of this readme
03:03 - without having to parse through it all
03:05 - but we're going to get back to this and
03:07 - there's actually something really cool
03:08 - about the table of contents which i
03:09 - really like
03:10 - so we're going to get back here because
03:12 - for me the table of contents is always
03:14 - something i do
03:15 - last because it's based on the structure
03:18 - of
03:18 - the readme and so if i don't know the
03:21 - structure yet how can i create a table
03:23 - of contents i i it's no so
03:27 - so i always do that last and so we'll
03:29 - get back to that
03:31 - but now the next thing i do
03:34 - is provide an about
03:38 - x and x app so about piggy and so i just
03:41 - say
03:41 - how piggy is an expense tracker for
03:43 - users it
03:45 - gives users insights as to what's in
03:47 - their piggy bank by
03:48 - being by providing a list breakdown of
03:52 - all of the expenses they log
03:54 - and it also provides users with
03:56 - resources on
03:57 - to better their financial literacy and
04:00 - so you know it doesn't have to be
04:02 - you know some wall street journal
04:03 - article or anything just
04:05 - something quick and just saying look
04:07 - this is what this is about
04:09 - because here's the thing you want
04:12 - to remember that a lot of people who are
04:16 - going to your github specifically
04:17 - i tailor things like this to recruiters
04:20 - when i'm looking
04:21 - specifically for when i'm looking for a
04:22 - job and recruiters don't have the time
04:25 - to open the app and try it out
04:28 - themselves and go into their code base
04:30 - especially because a lot of recruiters
04:32 - aren't engineers themselves so they
04:34 - likely don't know how to deal with all
04:36 - of this and so i try to just
04:38 - provide them with all the information
04:40 - they need
04:42 - on my apps on my projects without them
04:44 - actually needing to go
04:45 - into the code same thing with people who
04:49 - would interview you they those people
04:52 - may be
04:52 - engineers maybe project managers so they
04:56 - may have you know the better abilities
04:59 - to actually go through your code and
05:01 - things like that
05:01 - but still odds are they won't so just
05:04 - provide them with something easy to look
05:05 - at
05:06 - and just see what you're about and so on
05:08 - that theme the next thing i would always
05:10 - provide
05:11 - was a walkthrough video of my app i
05:14 - would film the walkthrough the same way
05:15 - i'm doing here
05:16 - just putting you know quicktime player
05:19 - screen record
05:20 - and hitting play and i would really just
05:24 - the video was always just me using it i
05:27 - wouldn't really
05:28 - explain um like the technologies i used
05:31 - i wouldn't
05:32 - i wouldn't really explain anything i
05:33 - would just be a user
05:35 - providing um and showing what the user
05:39 - experience would
05:40 - look like so they'd be very quick videos
05:41 - one to three minutes depending on how
05:44 - big
05:44 - the app was so in github
05:48 - the way to add you know links to certain
05:52 - texts so that
05:53 - it's the text that shows and not the
05:55 - link but once they click on the text
05:57 - they go to that link
05:59 - it's by putting brackets let me do it
06:02 - here
06:03 - it's by putting brackets putting text
06:06 - within
06:06 - brackets so you can say click me if you
06:09 - wanted a link
06:10 - that said that and then if you wanted it
06:13 - to go
06:14 - to google.com
06:19 - like that and that's how you do it you
06:23 - would put the url within parentheses
06:25 - make sure you don't have a space having
06:27 - a space changes
06:29 - um the ability for it to be linked so
06:32 - you wouldn't put a space just back to
06:33 - back and so so i can
06:35 - show you what this now looks like
06:39 - let's see let's zoom out a little tiny
06:42 - bit
06:43 - okay so you see now click me and i'm not
06:46 - going to click it because we haven't
06:48 - saved
06:48 - certain changes and it might mess things
06:50 - up so
06:51 - yeah now you can say click me and you
06:53 - see how there's no link being shown
06:56 - or anything no um url being shown
06:59 - yeah so that's something really cool
07:02 - about
07:02 - github that i really really like
07:05 - so i use that really everywhere where
07:08 - were we oh right here
07:10 - so yeah you have to click me right here
07:12 - but i'll take it out from now
07:16 - so the next thing i do is provide
07:19 - a list of technologies that i used in
07:22 - creating this front-end portion or
07:25 - back-end portion
07:26 - depending on what portion you're on for
07:28 - me it's end so defining the technologies
07:31 - i used the languages i used
07:32 - the frameworks i used for me this was
07:35 - built in
07:36 - vanilla javascript so i didn't use any
07:38 - frameworks like
07:39 - react angular view i didn't use any of
07:41 - those it was just javascript
07:43 - and so i put javascript es6 and then
07:46 - html
07:47 - css and i wanted to put the versions
07:50 - there um just so this readme withstands
07:54 - the test of time and i always know what
07:56 - version i used no matter how
07:59 - long time goes by you know
08:02 - things like that because that affects
08:03 - you know certain variables and scope and
08:06 - functions and things like that what
08:08 - version you use so that's why i put that
08:10 - there
08:11 - but yeah if i had used a framework i
08:13 - also would have included you know react
08:15 - and angular and things like that
08:17 - but yeah i list the technology so that
08:19 - the recruiter seeing this the
08:21 - interviewer seeing this can can see that
08:25 - i am not lying on my resume during my
08:28 - interviews when i say i'm proficient
08:30 - in javascript i'm proficient in angular
08:33 - things like that then i go down to the
08:36 - setup so the setup
08:38 - this is something that um honestly it's
08:41 - kind of like my
08:42 - least favorite part um even though it's
08:44 - so small but these
08:46 - setup i use this section to just
08:49 - provide people seeing um this read me
08:52 - just the instructions on how to have the
08:56 - project
08:56 - on their local computers um to
09:00 - mess around with and play around with on
09:02 - their own
09:03 - so they're not playing around my code no
09:04 - no i don't i don't play those games
09:07 - but they themselves can um
09:10 - you know alter things and see how the
09:12 - code really works
09:13 - and things like that and really just
09:15 - fostering their own learning
09:17 - that is where the license at the bottom
09:20 - comes up though so we'll get to that
09:22 - but yes i provide setup instructions and
09:24 - so i say
09:26 - to run this project please go to the
09:28 - backend repo
09:30 - which i made sure i linked to the actual
09:33 - github url all the urls here
09:37 - are you know adjusted so that certain
09:40 - confidential information of mine
09:42 - stays confidential but yeah you would
09:45 - have the full
09:46 - url here that would connect to the back
09:49 - end repo
09:50 - of this project because yeah you for me
09:53 - for this
09:54 - app you needed both a back end and a
09:56 - front end which were separate
09:58 - then two after you follow the
10:01 - instructions
10:02 - on the back end repo whatever was
10:04 - provided there
10:05 - run light server in your front end
10:08 - directory
10:09 - then click here and then that was the
10:12 - local host you know 2001
10:14 - so they can preview the app
10:17 - on their local machine instead of
10:18 - looking on youtube or things like that
10:22 - now i find this section so
10:25 - so so so important code examples
10:28 - code examples was just somewhere i put
10:33 - you know some type of um
10:36 - look into how i develop how i use
10:39 - functions how i create you know the
10:41 - functions and the variables and things
10:43 - like that
10:44 - and just showing like look this is yeah
10:47 - what i can do and so it's a very small
10:50 - of course like when it comes to
10:51 - the entire project this is point zero
10:53 - one percent of the entire project
10:56 - but it's still nice to see that you know
10:59 - the person actually
11:00 - okay they can create a
11:04 - iterative function they can um create
11:07 - like work with
11:08 - arrays and map through them and all of
11:10 - that and so
11:12 - i provided code examples now to provide
11:15 - code examples
11:16 - this is what you do you provide these
11:18 - backticks so not an apostrophe like this
11:21 - for me i use a macbook and so um
11:24 - this backtick is under the escape
11:28 - button on the top left of my keyboard
11:31 - so if you're also on the macbook on the
11:33 - top left of your keyboard
11:35 - um it's under this kit for me so for me
11:38 - it's the second button down from the top
11:41 - left
11:42 - that is where you put the backtick if
11:45 - you can't find it
11:46 - it's the same button as this like
11:49 - sideways s
11:50 - right here i know there's a name for it
11:52 - someone comment the name
11:53 - please for this i can't think of the
11:54 - name but um
11:56 - yeah it's the same uh button
11:59 - as this sideways s but
12:03 - it's the back tick portion so you do
12:06 - three of the back ticks then put
12:12 - example here and then you close it
12:16 - out with three more backticks
12:19 - and so let's see what it looks like
12:22 - in preview mode so preview changes
12:27 - let's zoom out and see you see how now
12:31 - it has its own little section right here
12:34 - the example here
12:35 - yes that's why code examples um
12:37 - specifically like using backticks
12:39 - is important because it really shows it
12:41 - as like
12:43 - code with i hope if you can't see what
12:45 - i'm talking about maybe
12:46 - bring your brightness down a little bit
12:48 - let's see can i bring my brightness down
12:51 - i feel like that doesn't help anything
12:54 - but yeah it creates these like little
12:56 - boxes this these like super light gray
12:58 - boxes
12:59 - around the code so that it really
13:01 - differentiates
13:02 - text from code and then i had provided
13:05 - different code examples two code
13:08 - examples and so
13:09 - it breaks them up into their own
13:12 - portions and so
13:13 - that's very important both for the look
13:15 - and also just the functionality of this
13:17 - readme
13:18 - and so let's go back to the editing
13:22 - of this go back to code examples
13:26 - and yeah now just take that out
13:29 - and so for me i wouldn't type this
13:33 - in readme specifically it i would just
13:36 - look through my app because
13:38 - the readme was always created after the
13:40 - app
13:41 - was finished always um
13:44 - if i if i was eager i would maybe put an
13:47 - about
13:48 - but really nothing else because the
13:49 - thing is
13:52 - you think you're creating one app and
13:54 - then a month goes by and you're finished
13:56 - and you realize it's a whole different
13:58 - app
13:58 - and so it's just better to leave things
14:00 - like readmes and all of that
14:02 - to the very end so that you're not in
14:04 - this loop of constantly editing your
14:06 - readmes and all of these
14:08 - different things so anyway
14:12 - yeah i would go into my code go into my
14:14 - project
14:15 - and find somewhere that i
14:18 - liked what i put you know and i would
14:22 - want it to be just a couple of lines
14:23 - like five to eight lines of code
14:26 - um and yeah make sure it was as
14:28 - efficient as possible something
14:30 - something to say like look like i write
14:32 - decent
14:34 - code for the level i'm in or something
14:36 - like that
14:37 - so then i would just copy and paste it
14:40 - and then put
14:41 - the backticks before before the back
14:43 - ticks
14:44 - after that coding section
14:48 - and so i did two different examples so
14:51 - that's why there's the two sets
14:53 - of the backticks i hope that made sense
14:56 - i
14:56 - really really hope it did but no we're
14:59 - just moving along here
15:00 - so next we have the piggy features
15:04 - this was where i provided the
15:07 - reader with what to expect with this app
15:10 - so input and track expenses visualize
15:14 - expenses through a colored
15:15 - donut chart and then provide finance and
15:18 - budgeting
15:19 - resources then i provided a to-do list
15:23 - part of the piggy features because i
15:26 - wanted to
15:27 - also just show that i have plans for
15:30 - this
15:30 - app i i don't consider myself done i
15:33 - never
15:34 - with specifically app development i
15:36 - never consider myself done
15:38 - it's app development and just
15:40 - development in general is something
15:41 - that you can constantly go at over and
15:45 - over
15:45 - so i always provided a to-do list and
15:48 - for here
15:49 - it was ad expense breakdown options
15:51 - labeling expense
15:52 - type status completed
15:56 - this app is built to carry out the
15:59 - crutch framework
16:00 - crud so crud stands for
16:03 - create read
16:07 - update delete basically
16:10 - every well maybe not every app but
16:13 - basically
16:14 - the core of most apps is to carry out
16:17 - the crud framework if you think about
16:18 - facebook
16:19 - instagram blogs you want to be able to
16:22 - create a post
16:23 - read other people's posts update your
16:27 - own posts or your own um what you call
16:29 - it
16:30 - wall or your own you know update
16:32 - pictures update any
16:34 - things like that or delete pictures
16:36 - delete post delete
16:38 - blog posts so that's really the
16:42 - base of um i say kind of every app but
16:46 - i may be wrong with every but with most
16:48 - apps that's the
16:50 - base you always want to see so yeah i
16:53 - say this app is built to carry out the
16:55 - crud framework
16:57 - then down here i say why i decided to
17:01 - create this specific app and it's the
17:04 - same thing
17:05 - um i shared with you all just moments
17:07 - ago
17:08 - because i care about financial literacy
17:11 - as a finance major myself
17:13 - and so i wanted to provide a resource
17:15 - for individuals to
17:18 - do the same to be their best
17:22 - selves when it comes to money habits and
17:24 - things like that
17:26 - then at the bottom here is some of the
17:29 - most important portions
17:30 - i would put a contact field in which
17:34 - i linked my name to my linkedin so
17:36 - created by
17:37 - and then my name in the brackets because
17:41 - i wanted it
17:42 - to directly link to my linkedin and so
17:44 - like my linkedin like url so it would be
17:47 - like slash like
17:48 - nia something like that and so
17:51 - then in the actual readme they'd be just
17:56 - able to click on my name it would take
17:58 - them to my linkedin
18:00 - then license so the license
18:04 - part is what allows
18:09 - other viewers other readers to
18:12 - use your code to develop with your code
18:14 - um
18:15 - but also say like hey you can't just
18:18 - steal this
18:19 - or you can maybe they can and that's
18:21 - okay with you i personally don't play
18:22 - those games
18:23 - but saying like yeah you can use this
18:26 - um but at the end of the day this is my
18:30 - work you can use it for your own
18:31 - learning and development and things like
18:33 - that but this
18:33 - is my work and so the license i'm going
18:37 - to have to look
18:38 - um here i'll make sure to actually
18:41 - provide a
18:42 - link to the license because i always use
18:44 - the same exact license every time
18:45 - so i'll provide a link to the license in
18:47 - the description box because i can't
18:50 - specifically remember i think i just
18:52 - searched
18:52 - github license types there were three
18:55 - main
18:56 - types i saw um like the three most
18:58 - popular ones and i chose one that i
19:01 - just preferred but um yeah i'll link the
19:04 - license
19:05 - um down in the description box that way
19:07 - it's just one less thing for you all to
19:09 - do
19:10 - and so yeah there we go and so then we
19:13 - would
19:14 - we would click commit changes i'm not
19:16 - going to go all the way down because
19:18 - some personal information is down there
19:20 - but um i'll just go into the preview
19:25 - that way you can see what it would look
19:27 - like
19:29 - so yeah oh shoot hold on
19:32 - wait a minute i am so sorry i forgot
19:36 - about the table of contents that is my
19:38 - bad y'all i'm so sorry so table of
19:40 - contents
19:41 - so table of contents i would go in
19:44 - and look at each of the sections i put
19:47 - in
19:47 - and in brackets place all of those
19:50 - sections
19:51 - here now we're talking about linking
19:54 - to link to outside resources we use the
19:57 - parentheses and the you know
19:59 - just the url to link inside
20:03 - your own readme you use a hashtag
20:06 - so you do i'll draw at the bottom here
20:09 - so i'll say
20:11 - example oh no hold on
20:15 - so i'll say example within brackets
20:18 - and then right away no space or anything
20:20 - right away you put parentheses
20:22 - and then you say whatever the name of
20:26 - that header
20:27 - was so example dash header
20:30 - there are no spaces allowed if there's a
20:32 - space you
20:34 - replace it with the dash so you see how
20:36 - about piggy
20:38 - has a space right here and the table of
20:40 - content name is about
20:42 - so to link to it
20:46 - i was i put hashtag about
20:49 - dash piggy then you see how underneath
20:52 - it's piggy walk through video
20:56 - and then but all i name it here in the
20:58 - table of contents is video
21:00 - so i would put hashtag piggy dash
21:03 - walkthrough dash video in the
21:06 - parentheses
21:07 - and so if we look at the preview again
21:11 - it would just be about video technology
21:14 - setup
21:14 - but it links to the different portions
21:19 - and so if i click it i'll wait
21:22 - let me get out of this so i will be
21:24 - right back
21:27 - hey all we're back so we have our table
21:31 - of contents
21:31 - let's say i want to jump right into code
21:34 - examples right away
21:36 - so i click code examples and it jumps
21:38 - you see how the screen
21:39 - jumps to that section and so now if i
21:43 - scroll
21:44 - back up i see all the other sections
21:46 - that were before it
21:48 - and i can you know go back to table of
21:50 - contents if i want to jump to the
21:52 - license
21:53 - i click license boom jumps right
21:56 - to the license the license is the last
21:59 - part of the page and so that's why it's
22:01 - not like up here because there's nothing
22:03 - to show below that but anyway
22:07 - but yeah so it jumps the license that's
22:09 - why the table of contents is important
22:11 - it
22:12 - is just a nice efficient way of
22:15 - providing the user with a more seamless
22:17 - easy experience and you know we're
22:20 - developers y'all like all we want to do
22:22 - is provide
22:22 - seamless efficient experiences to our
22:24 - users and so that does
22:26 - not change with readme and honestly if
22:28 - you're looking at
22:29 - you know companies and things like that
22:31 - it's that shows them that like no you
22:33 - think about the user
22:35 - process first you think about their
22:37 - experience first and they see that in
22:39 - these examples
22:40 - features piggy features boom
22:43 - just so i can show you just a little bit
22:45 - of the license
22:46 - i think you guys would appreciate seeing
22:48 - that this is what it is
22:50 - so the license is a you know for me it
22:53 - was like just a general license
22:56 - and yeah it provides like the rights and
22:59 - copyrights and
23:00 - the yada yada yada so make sure you're
23:02 - putting that
23:03 - in your readme because if you're
23:05 - building the next uber we don't want
23:07 - someone
23:08 - you know from down the hall who just
23:10 - stumbled upon your readme
23:12 - to get those millions y'all that's
23:14 - important don't forget to hit that
23:15 - subscribe button
23:16 - i hope you liked this really
23:18 - comprehensive detailed look into
23:21 - creating a really nice standard readme
23:24 - for your projects and yeah please let me
23:26 - know if you have any questions down
23:28 - below
23:28 - but don't forget to follow me on
23:30 - instagram at the black female engineer
23:32 - and i look forward to see y'all later so
23:34 - no bye all

Cleaned transcript:

hello everybody my name is nyan i'm the black female engineer i provide content for new and aspiring software engineers and today we're going to be talking about github readme now if this is not your first video you know make sure you hit that subscribe button it really helps me out really helps support my channel and so also make sure you follow me on instagram you can engage with me more there and so yeah let's just build this community now the github project we're going to be working with is an old project of mine while it's going through coding boot camp it's called piggy for piggy bank it was a financial literacy uh like web app where people would track their expenses and then see like a chart auto populate of the proportions of you know their expenses going to wear and all of that so yeah we're going to work with that so let's get to it so this is what our readme is going to look like we're going to go into very deep detail about how to make it look like this but i wanted to show you what the end result is code examples picky features status why contact and license so let's scroll back up and click on yeah click on edit you all would have a blank like default readme that github would have created automatically after you create a repo it would have just like just default stuff and so you'd click this pencil button to edit it so right away the first thing we want to do is tell people what this app is what is the title of your app and you know make that the first thing they see and so we do that in github by putting this you know hashtag pound symbol um and then followed by a space and then the title you want your audience to see so for me that was piggy web app front end i've also done it where it's just the name of the app and front end i always make sure it says front end or back and because for me i never have combined projects i make sure that there's always a separation of concern that's really for me the most efficient way to develop and so my repos always say front end or back end and so there that was and then there's the table of contents so in github your headers start with a pound or one hashtag and then your sub headers are two hashtags and so everything else in here are two hashtags and the next thing i put here are the table of contents so that people can very quickly from the getgo know what to expect out of this readme without having to parse through it all but we're going to get back to this and there's actually something really cool about the table of contents which i really like so we're going to get back here because for me the table of contents is always something i do last because it's based on the structure of the readme and so if i don't know the structure yet how can i create a table of contents i i it's no so so i always do that last and so we'll get back to that but now the next thing i do is provide an about x and x app so about piggy and so i just say how piggy is an expense tracker for users it gives users insights as to what's in their piggy bank by being by providing a list breakdown of all of the expenses they log and it also provides users with resources on to better their financial literacy and so you know it doesn't have to be you know some wall street journal article or anything just something quick and just saying look this is what this is about because here's the thing you want to remember that a lot of people who are going to your github specifically i tailor things like this to recruiters when i'm looking specifically for when i'm looking for a job and recruiters don't have the time to open the app and try it out themselves and go into their code base especially because a lot of recruiters aren't engineers themselves so they likely don't know how to deal with all of this and so i try to just provide them with all the information they need on my apps on my projects without them actually needing to go into the code same thing with people who would interview you they those people may be engineers maybe project managers so they may have you know the better abilities to actually go through your code and things like that but still odds are they won't so just provide them with something easy to look at and just see what you're about and so on that theme the next thing i would always provide was a walkthrough video of my app i would film the walkthrough the same way i'm doing here just putting you know quicktime player screen record and hitting play and i would really just the video was always just me using it i wouldn't really explain um like the technologies i used i wouldn't i wouldn't really explain anything i would just be a user providing um and showing what the user experience would look like so they'd be very quick videos one to three minutes depending on how big the app was so in github the way to add you know links to certain texts so that it's the text that shows and not the link but once they click on the text they go to that link it's by putting brackets let me do it here it's by putting brackets putting text within brackets so you can say click me if you wanted a link that said that and then if you wanted it to go to google.com like that and that's how you do it you would put the url within parentheses make sure you don't have a space having a space changes um the ability for it to be linked so you wouldn't put a space just back to back and so so i can show you what this now looks like let's see let's zoom out a little tiny bit okay so you see now click me and i'm not going to click it because we haven't saved certain changes and it might mess things up so yeah now you can say click me and you see how there's no link being shown or anything no um url being shown yeah so that's something really cool about github that i really really like so i use that really everywhere where were we oh right here so yeah you have to click me right here but i'll take it out from now so the next thing i do is provide a list of technologies that i used in creating this frontend portion or backend portion depending on what portion you're on for me it's end so defining the technologies i used the languages i used the frameworks i used for me this was built in vanilla javascript so i didn't use any frameworks like react angular view i didn't use any of those it was just javascript and so i put javascript es6 and then html css and i wanted to put the versions there um just so this readme withstands the test of time and i always know what version i used no matter how long time goes by you know things like that because that affects you know certain variables and scope and functions and things like that what version you use so that's why i put that there but yeah if i had used a framework i also would have included you know react and angular and things like that but yeah i list the technology so that the recruiter seeing this the interviewer seeing this can can see that i am not lying on my resume during my interviews when i say i'm proficient in javascript i'm proficient in angular things like that then i go down to the setup so the setup this is something that um honestly it's kind of like my least favorite part um even though it's so small but these setup i use this section to just provide people seeing um this read me just the instructions on how to have the project on their local computers um to mess around with and play around with on their own so they're not playing around my code no no i don't i don't play those games but they themselves can um you know alter things and see how the code really works and things like that and really just fostering their own learning that is where the license at the bottom comes up though so we'll get to that but yes i provide setup instructions and so i say to run this project please go to the backend repo which i made sure i linked to the actual github url all the urls here are you know adjusted so that certain confidential information of mine stays confidential but yeah you would have the full url here that would connect to the back end repo of this project because yeah you for me for this app you needed both a back end and a front end which were separate then two after you follow the instructions on the back end repo whatever was provided there run light server in your front end directory then click here and then that was the local host you know 2001 so they can preview the app on their local machine instead of looking on youtube or things like that now i find this section so so so so important code examples code examples was just somewhere i put you know some type of um look into how i develop how i use functions how i create you know the functions and the variables and things like that and just showing like look this is yeah what i can do and so it's a very small of course like when it comes to the entire project this is point zero one percent of the entire project but it's still nice to see that you know the person actually okay they can create a iterative function they can um create like work with arrays and map through them and all of that and so i provided code examples now to provide code examples this is what you do you provide these backticks so not an apostrophe like this for me i use a macbook and so um this backtick is under the escape button on the top left of my keyboard so if you're also on the macbook on the top left of your keyboard um it's under this kit for me so for me it's the second button down from the top left that is where you put the backtick if you can't find it it's the same button as this like sideways s right here i know there's a name for it someone comment the name please for this i can't think of the name but um yeah it's the same uh button as this sideways s but it's the back tick portion so you do three of the back ticks then put example here and then you close it out with three more backticks and so let's see what it looks like in preview mode so preview changes let's zoom out and see you see how now it has its own little section right here the example here yes that's why code examples um specifically like using backticks is important because it really shows it as like code with i hope if you can't see what i'm talking about maybe bring your brightness down a little bit let's see can i bring my brightness down i feel like that doesn't help anything but yeah it creates these like little boxes this these like super light gray boxes around the code so that it really differentiates text from code and then i had provided different code examples two code examples and so it breaks them up into their own portions and so that's very important both for the look and also just the functionality of this readme and so let's go back to the editing of this go back to code examples and yeah now just take that out and so for me i wouldn't type this in readme specifically it i would just look through my app because the readme was always created after the app was finished always um if i if i was eager i would maybe put an about but really nothing else because the thing is you think you're creating one app and then a month goes by and you're finished and you realize it's a whole different app and so it's just better to leave things like readmes and all of that to the very end so that you're not in this loop of constantly editing your readmes and all of these different things so anyway yeah i would go into my code go into my project and find somewhere that i liked what i put you know and i would want it to be just a couple of lines like five to eight lines of code um and yeah make sure it was as efficient as possible something something to say like look like i write decent code for the level i'm in or something like that so then i would just copy and paste it and then put the backticks before before the back ticks after that coding section and so i did two different examples so that's why there's the two sets of the backticks i hope that made sense i really really hope it did but no we're just moving along here so next we have the piggy features this was where i provided the reader with what to expect with this app so input and track expenses visualize expenses through a colored donut chart and then provide finance and budgeting resources then i provided a todo list part of the piggy features because i wanted to also just show that i have plans for this app i i don't consider myself done i never with specifically app development i never consider myself done it's app development and just development in general is something that you can constantly go at over and over so i always provided a todo list and for here it was ad expense breakdown options labeling expense type status completed this app is built to carry out the crutch framework crud so crud stands for create read update delete basically every well maybe not every app but basically the core of most apps is to carry out the crud framework if you think about facebook instagram blogs you want to be able to create a post read other people's posts update your own posts or your own um what you call it wall or your own you know update pictures update any things like that or delete pictures delete post delete blog posts so that's really the base of um i say kind of every app but i may be wrong with every but with most apps that's the base you always want to see so yeah i say this app is built to carry out the crud framework then down here i say why i decided to create this specific app and it's the same thing um i shared with you all just moments ago because i care about financial literacy as a finance major myself and so i wanted to provide a resource for individuals to do the same to be their best selves when it comes to money habits and things like that then at the bottom here is some of the most important portions i would put a contact field in which i linked my name to my linkedin so created by and then my name in the brackets because i wanted it to directly link to my linkedin and so like my linkedin like url so it would be like slash like nia something like that and so then in the actual readme they'd be just able to click on my name it would take them to my linkedin then license so the license part is what allows other viewers other readers to use your code to develop with your code um but also say like hey you can't just steal this or you can maybe they can and that's okay with you i personally don't play those games but saying like yeah you can use this um but at the end of the day this is my work you can use it for your own learning and development and things like that but this is my work and so the license i'm going to have to look um here i'll make sure to actually provide a link to the license because i always use the same exact license every time so i'll provide a link to the license in the description box because i can't specifically remember i think i just searched github license types there were three main types i saw um like the three most popular ones and i chose one that i just preferred but um yeah i'll link the license um down in the description box that way it's just one less thing for you all to do and so yeah there we go and so then we would we would click commit changes i'm not going to go all the way down because some personal information is down there but um i'll just go into the preview that way you can see what it would look like so yeah oh shoot hold on wait a minute i am so sorry i forgot about the table of contents that is my bad y'all i'm so sorry so table of contents so table of contents i would go in and look at each of the sections i put in and in brackets place all of those sections here now we're talking about linking to link to outside resources we use the parentheses and the you know just the url to link inside your own readme you use a hashtag so you do i'll draw at the bottom here so i'll say example oh no hold on so i'll say example within brackets and then right away no space or anything right away you put parentheses and then you say whatever the name of that header was so example dash header there are no spaces allowed if there's a space you replace it with the dash so you see how about piggy has a space right here and the table of content name is about so to link to it i was i put hashtag about dash piggy then you see how underneath it's piggy walk through video and then but all i name it here in the table of contents is video so i would put hashtag piggy dash walkthrough dash video in the parentheses and so if we look at the preview again it would just be about video technology setup but it links to the different portions and so if i click it i'll wait let me get out of this so i will be right back hey all we're back so we have our table of contents let's say i want to jump right into code examples right away so i click code examples and it jumps you see how the screen jumps to that section and so now if i scroll back up i see all the other sections that were before it and i can you know go back to table of contents if i want to jump to the license i click license boom jumps right to the license the license is the last part of the page and so that's why it's not like up here because there's nothing to show below that but anyway but yeah so it jumps the license that's why the table of contents is important it is just a nice efficient way of providing the user with a more seamless easy experience and you know we're developers y'all like all we want to do is provide seamless efficient experiences to our users and so that does not change with readme and honestly if you're looking at you know companies and things like that it's that shows them that like no you think about the user process first you think about their experience first and they see that in these examples features piggy features boom just so i can show you just a little bit of the license i think you guys would appreciate seeing that this is what it is so the license is a you know for me it was like just a general license and yeah it provides like the rights and copyrights and the yada yada yada so make sure you're putting that in your readme because if you're building the next uber we don't want someone you know from down the hall who just stumbled upon your readme to get those millions y'all that's important don't forget to hit that subscribe button i hope you liked this really comprehensive detailed look into creating a really nice standard readme for your projects and yeah please let me know if you have any questions down below but don't forget to follow me on instagram at the black female engineer and i look forward to see y'all later so no bye all
