02:11 - a masters of science in electrical
02:13 - engineering from uc
02:14 - san diego so we're glad that you're with
02:16 - us this evening kelsey thanks for being
02:18 - here
02:19 - and then our second panelist is
02:21 - christine marette she
02:23 - is a software engineer at prudential
02:25 - financial
02:26 - um and a full stack developer who uses
02:28 - traditional and modern technologies to
02:30 - design
02:31 - solutions and she holds a bachelor's of
02:34 - science
02:34 - in computer engineering from the
02:37 - university of maryland
02:38 - college park and so we are super excited
02:41 - to have these two wonderful panelists
02:44 - if you didn't wave hello to the people
02:45 - christine wherever the people
02:47 - i'm super excited to have folks here
02:49 - tonight so um
02:51 - what we are going to do is we're going
02:53 - to start off tonight with an
02:54 - icebreaker um and then um
02:57 - we are going to uh follow that with some
03:00 - questions that will be addressed
03:01 - um by uh that will address the concerns
03:05 - of the girls who code
03:06 - college age alumni um in various
03:09 - students across the country who are
03:11 - beginning
03:12 - matriculating or ending their college
03:14 - experience so we're going to really take
03:16 - some time
03:17 - to really address some of the questions
03:18 - that you all have
03:20 - and then at the end of the conversation
03:21 - we'll have a q a segment that i'll lead
03:24 - um with questions that we gathered in
03:26 - advance specifically from
03:27 - our users and from our viewers so we're
03:30 - super excited about that so
03:32 - um so here's what we're going to do i'm
03:33 - going to start this question off with
03:35 - our panelists
03:36 - um kelsey i'm going to have you answer
03:38 - this one first
03:40 - um what was your favorite computer
03:42 - science or
03:43 - non-computer science class when you were
03:46 - in
03:46 - undergrad okay so i
03:50 - actually aren't a computer science major
03:52 - i'm an electrical engineering
03:53 - major but i did take some cs courses so
03:56 - i would have to say
03:58 - that my favorite was just the
04:00 - introduction
04:01 - to fundamentals of computer science it
04:03 - was just basic c
04:04 - programming because a lot of the key
04:06 - aspects that i learned there
04:08 - i applied it to other languages and
04:11 - other problems it's a great way of
04:13 - conquering problems it really helps with
04:16 - problem solving
04:18 - but for my non-favorites or my favorite
04:21 - non-cs class it's definitely
04:24 - more of a physics class it was
04:25 - electromagnetics so
04:27 - i'll leave that you know just there
04:30 - awesome awesome christine what about you
04:32 - what were your favorite
04:33 - cs and non-cs courses um
04:36 - let's see cs i think it was the same so
04:39 - it was my first cs
04:40 - class um and not so much like the
04:42 - material but just how it was presented
04:45 - so i had a really cool professor like
04:47 - biker dude
04:49 - and i was just like okay this is
04:51 - relatable like
04:52 - it's not you don't have to be like a
04:53 - certain kind of way um to be a
04:55 - programmer
04:56 - so it was just how the material was
04:58 - presented to me i was so it was so
05:00 - relatable
05:01 - um so yeah he made the class epic and i
05:04 - was like okay this is
05:05 - i'm doing this um yeah and then
05:09 - non-cs i'd have to say um psychology
05:13 - like psychology was super interesting
05:15 - for me um
05:16 - it was just like another using another
05:18 - part of your brain so yeah
05:20 - for sure excellent excellent so viewers
05:23 - we want to hear from you right
05:24 - um we want you to answer the poll
05:27 - question that should have just popped up
05:28 - on your screen
05:29 - um is your favorite class computer
05:32 - science related or
05:34 - is it a non-computer science related
05:36 - class we're going to give you
05:38 - about 30 seconds to respond and then
05:41 - we'll get
05:42 - that little piece of feedback and then
05:44 - we'll move forward
05:49 - what about you derek do you have any
05:52 - favorite class
05:53 - you know um so i was a education major
05:57 - in college
05:57 - and so um for me all of my favorite
06:01 - classes in college
06:02 - um in general either were an education
06:05 - class anything that allowed me to be in
06:07 - front of students in front of people
06:10 - getting a chance to teach getting a
06:11 - chance to impart knowledge
06:14 - helping students and seeing that light
06:16 - bulb that would go off with students
06:17 - when they learned a new concept
06:19 - when they really understood how to
06:22 - multiply numbers or whatever that
06:23 - concept might have been so i really
06:25 - really really enjoyed that course
06:27 - or those classes i also had a really
06:29 - cool class at my undergrad
06:31 - called marriage and family and it was
06:33 - taught it was teen taught by a
06:35 - theology professor a psychology
06:39 - professor
06:39 - and a sociology professor and so it
06:42 - talked about kind of the construct of
06:44 - marriage within societies
06:47 - and within different cultures and it was
06:48 - really really really interesting
06:50 - um to hear the perspective especially
06:53 - from those different
06:54 - areas those different fields and how
06:56 - that really
06:57 - um influenced i guess how different
06:59 - cultures and different areas looked at
07:01 - marriage so
07:02 - that was my favorite course in college
07:05 - yeah it was very different very cool
07:07 - though um very very cool
07:09 - so um thanks to everyone for for
07:11 - answering the poll so
07:13 - about 53 of our um
07:16 - attendees here said that a computer
07:18 - science course was their
07:20 - most favorite class um in college in
07:22 - about 48
07:23 - set a non-computer science course so
07:25 - really split that down the middle
07:26 - and you know i think it really goes to
07:28 - the point that um
07:30 - whatever field you go into after you
07:32 - graduate from college
07:34 - there really is the mix of the skill set
07:36 - that you're going to learn within your
07:38 - program right
07:39 - and i think the ability to think
07:40 - critically the ability to
07:43 - speak properly the ability to write
07:45 - properly
07:47 - to problem solve all of those things
07:49 - really i think go into
07:51 - a lot of us and our daily jobs and what
07:53 - it is that we do
07:54 - and so i think that that really speaks
07:56 - to having to use both your left brain
07:58 - and your right brain
07:59 - um as we really go throughout our career
08:01 - so i think that that's a really
08:03 - um awesome thing so what we're going to
08:05 - do is we're going to
08:07 - going to go on and um
08:10 - kind of move into our discussion
08:11 - questions so we do have some questions
08:13 - that we want to ask our panelists
08:15 - um this evening and you know we know
08:17 - that the computer science space is
08:19 - really dominated by a majority um white
08:22 - men
08:22 - um and asian men right and it's one of
08:25 - the reasons why
08:26 - this organization girls who code was
08:29 - really birthed
08:30 - and and why it really came to be um and
08:32 - we also recognize
08:34 - that uh being a woman in the technical
08:36 - world
08:37 - um has its barriers um and particularly
08:40 - as women of color there are certainly i
08:42 - would imagine another set of challenges
08:44 - even on top of uh of just being a woman
08:48 - um that you have to deal with so really
08:50 - with that being said
08:51 - i'm gonna direct this really and have
08:53 - christine maybe answer this first but
08:55 - what's one piece of advice you wish
08:57 - someone would have told you as an
08:58 - incoming student looking to major in
09:01 - computer sciences oregon kind of the
09:03 - sciences
09:04 - in general um
09:07 - let's see one piece of advice i think
09:10 - perseverance is key
09:12 - like um just
09:15 - anything like worth having like it'll
09:17 - just take hours and time
09:19 - um but also people surrounding yourself
09:21 - with good people
09:23 - um and that's i mean as much as there is
09:26 - you know
09:26 - conflict and people will see you
09:28 - differently there are also just so much
09:30 - there's a lot of good as well so there
09:32 - are people you can align yourself with
09:34 - um people like you people not like you
09:37 - um but you know if you both have the
09:38 - same end goal you can work together
09:41 - um so yeah i'd say like one perseverance
09:44 - and to aligning yourself with the right
09:45 - people
09:47 - awesome kelsey what about you what
09:48 - what's that one piece of advice that
09:50 - you're like man
09:51 - someone should have told me this at the
09:53 - beginning of my program
09:55 - uh definitely in the beginning do not
09:58 - compare yourself
09:59 - to other people you're going in and it's
10:01 - about you and your own development so i
10:03 - think that was one thing i probably
10:06 - should have you know took into
10:07 - consideration when i joined because i
10:09 - went to a predominantly you know white
10:12 - school and especially in my courses they
10:14 - were mostly men
10:15 - so going in you're already like the one
10:17 - out of 10
10:18 - women that are in the in the the class
10:21 - so
10:22 - definitely leave that at the door you
10:24 - know you're in there to learn
10:26 - uh that would be my best advice yeah and
10:28 - i and i think
10:29 - those are both really great pieces of
10:31 - advice and i think it really
10:32 - kind of gets to the notion that um you
10:35 - know you got admitted into these
10:37 - colleges
10:38 - um and in these programs for a specific
10:40 - reason right those colleges
10:41 - as someone who works in college
10:43 - admissions and this is what i do right
10:45 - we don't admit students that we don't
10:47 - think you're going to be successful in
10:48 - the program and so really being able to
10:51 - um be confident in yourself and know
10:53 - that you belong
10:54 - even if it doesn't always look like you
10:57 - belong
10:58 - right and you know i think about um not
11:01 - to compare my experience to the
11:02 - experience of our panelists but
11:04 - um being a black man and being one of
11:06 - the only black males in
11:08 - a lot of my classes in an education
11:10 - program early childhood education
11:12 - program
11:12 - a field that's dominated by women in
11:15 - really i'm having to know that i'm there
11:17 - for a reason
11:17 - um and i was chosen to be there for a
11:21 - reason
11:21 - so that confidence is i think really
11:23 - really important
11:25 - um when you think about kind of moving
11:27 - into the next
11:28 - question um transitioning from high
11:30 - school to college is a very
11:32 - hectic process i think especially given
11:36 - where we are right now in the world with
11:38 - covid
11:39 - um you know with a lot of the the
11:42 - different challenges that we're having i
11:43 - think as
11:44 - as a community um and so you know you're
11:46 - transitioning from high school to
11:48 - college it's hectic
11:49 - um you feel like you're getting the hang
11:51 - of things
11:52 - um and then you really have to make that
11:55 - decision of
11:56 - is this the major that i really want to
11:58 - do is this
11:59 - the the the piece the the program that i
12:02 - really want to move
12:03 - um forward with and so um you know from
12:06 - our audience we really want to know
12:08 - at this point in time um have you
12:10 - declared your major i'm
12:12 - really curious if you have declared
12:15 - your major so far so hopefully that poll
12:17 - question is popping up here if it's not
12:19 - popping up now should be popping up
12:20 - shortly
12:21 - um there we go we want to get an idea if
12:23 - you have already
12:25 - um declared your major so um while the
12:28 - audience is doing our poll and i'll
12:29 - report those results here
12:31 - um in just a few um kelsey can you tell
12:34 - us how and when
12:35 - you determined which computer science
12:38 - specialization you wanted to major in
12:40 - can you really kind of give us an
12:42 - insight
12:42 - into your process of deciding how you
12:44 - how you chose that
12:46 - sure um so when i went into my undergrad
12:49 - i
12:49 - already decided that i was going to do
12:51 - electrical engineering
12:52 - i didn't go undecided i already chose
12:55 - that major
12:56 - and what really made me choose that was
12:58 - from courses and clubs that i did in
13:00 - high school
13:01 - so i was in a robotics club and i did a
13:03 - physics and those kind of both helped me
13:06 - understand
13:07 - what i kind of wanted to do in the next
13:09 - four years or what more information i
13:11 - wanted
13:12 - out of that area so definitely
13:15 - if you really like coursework that
13:17 - you've done in your last
13:19 - year of high school um and you want to
13:22 - do that
13:22 - going forward that that's always a
13:24 - leading way to decide
13:25 - uh whether the major is right for you
13:28 - and did you happen to change your major
13:29 - at all kelsey did you like
13:31 - once you entered college did you stick
13:32 - with your major did you go and
13:34 - maybe switch concentrations or areas
13:37 - so for my master's i did photonics which
13:40 - is kind of a subdivision of
13:42 - uh electrical engineering so for that
13:45 - one
13:46 - i liked the way the field was
13:48 - underdeveloped meaning there was a lot
13:50 - of research to be done
13:52 - so i wanted to do my master's studies
13:54 - and that
13:56 - and and that's kind of the main
13:58 - specialization that i picked
13:59 - it kind of incorporated uh electrical
14:02 - engineering and physics
14:04 - together and so that's why i picked it
14:06 - great awesome
14:07 - um we've got the poll results before i
14:09 - asked christine to kind of jump in with
14:11 - with her answers but
14:12 - um it looks like 41 of students have not
14:15 - dick
14:15 - or have declared their major excuse me
14:17 - and then 59 of students
14:19 - have not declared their major um and so
14:21 - just a really interesting piece of
14:23 - advice and i don't think that that's a
14:24 - bad thing it's not an outlier in any way
14:27 - shape or form
14:28 - many students do enter into their
14:30 - college career
14:31 - um without a major um they go in
14:33 - undecided that is the most popular major
14:36 - if you will at the college i work for
14:38 - and at most colleges that i've worked
14:39 - for um in the past and so
14:41 - totally okay if you don't know but
14:43 - christine for you how how did you
14:45 - go through that process of picking what
14:47 - specialization you wanted to major in
14:50 - um i'd have to say for me it was more
14:52 - elimination of what i didn't want to do
14:56 - which was i don't know it worked for me
14:58 - but i mean a lot of my family members
15:00 - are in
15:00 - like medicine and health and i was like
15:02 - i can't do that
15:04 - um but then i did like in high school i
15:06 - did enjoy like the math and the physics
15:07 - and sciences so i was like i'll
15:09 - probably will stick to engineering and
15:11 - entering college i thought i was going
15:12 - to do civil engineering
15:14 - um but once i took that first computer
15:17 - science class i was like forget that
15:19 - this is
15:21 - so i would say just in your first year
15:23 - like just take as many
15:24 - it's the time that you have to really
15:26 - explore
15:27 - um you might not know what's out there
15:29 - um so it's
15:30 - in a way it's good to be undecided it's
15:32 - like a lot more things are open to you
15:34 - um so yeah that's how i got into
15:38 - computer engineering made the right
15:39 - choice i am very
15:41 - happy i did and i think that that spot
15:45 - on christine in terms
15:47 - of um coming in as an undecided student
15:50 - uh you know i think sometimes students
15:51 - feel this pressure
15:52 - that i've got to enter in um to college
15:55 - knowing exactly what it is that i want
15:58 - to do
15:58 - um for the rest of my life and i just i
16:01 - don't think that that's always possible
16:03 - i'm
16:03 - 34 years old and there are still days
16:06 - that i'm like yeah
16:07 - maybe i'll switch careers here you know
16:09 - and so it's it's okay to take classes
16:12 - across campus
16:13 - um and really get a sense of what you
16:15 - like and what you don't like
16:16 - um and using the resources that your
16:18 - campus has to offer
16:20 - you know many campuses have career
16:22 - centers and they have assessments that
16:24 - you can take
16:24 - to help you understand what your skill
16:27 - sets are
16:28 - and how your skill sets might be best
16:30 - used um as you move forward too so
16:32 - really great
16:33 - great stories that you all really kind
16:34 - of share with us
16:36 - about that um so you know now that both
16:39 - of you are working in the workforce
16:41 - um you're out you're you're in your
16:43 - career you're doing
16:44 - really awesome work i'm sure you've had
16:47 - some time to reflect on your college
16:49 - experience
16:50 - and probably have realized that you've
16:51 - learned a lot from college
16:54 - and from what you went through there of
16:57 - all the lessons that you learned in the
16:58 - classes that you took
17:00 - what skills coding languages and
17:02 - information helped you best prepare for
17:05 - your role
17:06 - as a full-time employee and christine
17:08 - maybe if you want to take that one first
17:10 - for us
17:11 - sure um one thing i do think
17:15 - college like really helped me and was um
17:18 - kelsey had mentioned earlier like
17:19 - learning the basic principles
17:21 - that will just take you because with
17:24 - technology especially things are always
17:26 - changing
17:27 - um so you those basic principles a lot
17:29 - of the newer technologies are all built
17:31 - on
17:32 - that foundational layer so i will say
17:35 - like
17:36 - a lot of the languages we had i had some
17:38 - classes where we did like five
17:40 - programming languages in a semester
17:42 - and it wasn't necessarily that they
17:43 - wanted us to master all those languages
17:45 - it was just learning how to learn
17:48 - um so i think it's just you need to like
17:51 - be i think like realize you're always
17:53 - going to be learning it's not like you
17:54 - finish college and you stop learning
17:56 - um so keep learning like you're forever
17:59 - a student that's what i'm learning i
18:01 - still like learn
18:01 - new things like classes you know so
18:04 - definitely
18:05 - i just keep on the like the learning
18:06 - attitude yeah
18:08 - that's so spot on being a lifelong
18:10 - learner i think is just something that
18:12 - all of us should strive to be and should
18:14 - be
18:14 - um and we do continue to learn
18:16 - constantly throughout our careers and
18:18 - throughout our lives and so that's a
18:19 - really
18:20 - really great lesson um that you learned
18:22 - kelsey what about you what what do you
18:24 - think that you really
18:25 - learned on what skills what informations
18:28 - what experiences really
18:30 - helped best prepare you to be a
18:31 - full-time employee
18:33 - so a lot of my coursework uh was
18:36 - designed on problem solving
18:38 - so a lot of assessing the issue and
18:39 - figuring out the best way to
18:41 - solve it so i definitely apply that in
18:44 - my
18:44 - career right now what i do is i take
18:47 - issues from customers and i find the
18:49 - best way to make to solve them to
18:51 - you know find their pain points and
18:52 - minimize them
18:54 - definitely you're always learning just
18:56 - like what christine said
18:57 - uh i didn't know python going into my
19:00 - job
19:01 - but currently i do a lot of scripting to
19:03 - make things more efficient
19:05 - so if i'm trying to test something i
19:07 - will design a python script
19:09 - in order to test it i didn't know that
19:12 - but
19:12 - having the fundamentals from that c
19:14 - class definitely helped me
19:16 - you know graphs the language better than
19:19 - if i didn't have anything
19:20 - so even though i'm not really using what
19:23 - i learned in school
19:24 - having the background in it really
19:26 - helped me uh
19:27 - progress into my career right now yeah i
19:30 - think those solid foundations
19:33 - those solid foundational courses and
19:35 - skills that people learn
19:36 - really can kind of help um kind of
19:39 - through that process as well and you
19:40 - know i think for me when i think about
19:42 - kind of going into the workforce and
19:44 - kind of what that really meant and and
19:47 - and how that really was going to
19:48 - manifest itself it really you know i
19:50 - think i used a lot of
19:52 - um the skills that i actually learned
19:54 - outside of the classroom
19:55 - right i mean i think that there's so
19:56 - much that we learn in the classroom
19:58 - right um which is awesome and it's it's
20:02 - a
20:02 - really great thing to be able to do that
20:04 - and at the same time i think there's
20:06 - so much that you're going to learn
20:07 - through your clubs
20:09 - through your organizations um through
20:11 - having leadership
20:12 - roles um in some of these organizations
20:15 - there's so much
20:16 - there um in terms of learning how to
20:18 - speak learning how to communicate
20:20 - learning how to think critically
20:22 - those problems solving skills that you
20:24 - really spoke of
20:25 - um those kind of things can really help
20:27 - i think when you go into
20:29 - the workforce as well so some really
20:32 - really really really great points there
20:34 - so
20:34 - what we're going to do we're going to
20:35 - move into some q a
20:38 - um and this is q a that we have gathered
20:40 - from
20:41 - um you um our panelists are not our
20:43 - panelists our attendees if you will
20:45 - um in advance to this particular panel
20:48 - um
20:49 - and we are going to pose these questions
20:51 - um to each of our panelists and see
20:53 - what insight they can share with us so
20:55 - our first question is from mary
20:57 - m um and the question is what if
21:01 - anything has ever
21:02 - made you want to stop pursuing or drop
21:05 - out of
21:06 - the stem field or computer science um
21:08 - and what made you decide to stay with it
21:11 - um so have there ever been anything
21:13 - that's you've been like you know what
21:14 - maybe this is
21:15 - not for me like i'm gonna go and do
21:17 - something else or what is it that
21:19 - actually keeps you
21:20 - keeps you in it kelsey uh for me
21:23 - definitely seeing like a low grade on a
21:28 - a final exam or something getting a bad
21:30 - score in a class like i remember
21:32 - even though the fundamentals that i say
21:35 - is one of my favorite cs classes i
21:36 - didn't do exactly that
21:38 - the greatest in that class i think i
21:39 - ended up with a b or something in the
21:41 - class one
21:42 - i'm coming from a high school you know
21:44 - all
21:45 - a's b's you know i'm used to usually at
21:47 - that level of performing and
21:49 - and when you get a letter grade that you
21:52 - didn't feel like you
21:53 - need or would like uh that could
21:56 - definitely
21:57 - you know dimmer or put a dimmer on what
21:59 - you want to do
22:00 - in the future so definitely getting that
22:02 - the first quarter
22:03 - uh for me uh made me question like is
22:06 - this really actually kind of what i want
22:07 - to be doing but
22:08 - uh i continued the coursework to see if
22:11 - there was anything else you know maybe
22:12 - if there was another
22:13 - pitfall in the future then i would
22:15 - reconsider and i didn't have it so
22:18 - i definitely think even though you get a
22:20 - low grade in one class just
22:21 - try keep try it one more time you know
22:23 - keep keep going with the flow and
22:26 - uh if you you may find that actually is
22:28 - is great and it comes back to
22:30 - be a positive experience yeah yeah and i
22:34 - i can so relate to that experience
22:36 - kelsey i tell this story all the time
22:38 - with students that i work with but um
22:40 - you know i was a student in high school
22:42 - 3.8
22:43 - gpa student i had a 28 a.c.t like i did
22:46 - well
22:47 - got into a great school and at the end
22:49 - of my first semester i had a 1.8 gpa
22:51 - right and you start really thinking
22:54 - about and i think having that imposter
22:56 - syndrome
22:57 - should i be here do i belong here at the
22:59 - this institution do i belong in this
23:01 - program
23:02 - that i've decided to go into and i think
23:05 - to continue to kelsey's point to
23:07 - continue
23:08 - to push yourself forward and say this is
23:10 - just a roadblock
23:11 - this is just one blip in my entire
23:14 - journey that i'm really going to have
23:16 - over the course of my years
23:18 - in college and after college and know
23:20 - that you can
23:21 - get through that you can certainly go
23:23 - through that process
23:24 - and come out of it on the other side and
23:27 - end up doing well you know i graduate
23:28 - with a 3.0 gpa which i was very
23:30 - excited about to have that into my four
23:33 - years in college and so
23:34 - i think that persistence piece is really
23:37 - um important
23:38 - um for you christine what was it that
23:40 - might have made you stop pursuing
23:42 - um a stem field or computer science and
23:45 - what was that that thing that maybe
23:47 - turned it around for you to say you know
23:48 - what i'm going gonna keep going with it
23:50 - yeah i mean i went through this like
23:53 - with every project i did
23:54 - i was it was a lot of sleepless nights
23:56 - and i was like what am i doing my
23:59 - friends are out
24:00 - having normal college experiences and
24:02 - i'm here in the library
24:04 - um for hours on end and this thing isn't
24:06 - compiling
24:07 - um so i think for me was like the long
24:10 - nights
24:11 - and i had some like mental breakdowns
24:15 - um but at the end of the day like things
24:17 - did compile
24:18 - i like would have you know like however
24:22 - long it took it was so rewarding though
24:24 - like to see something that you
24:25 - i can't come out of your head onto a
24:27 - computer um
24:28 - so yeah a lot of moments of doubt um
24:32 - but i will say was rewarding to see
24:34 - something from my head in a screen
24:37 - um i'm gonna go off script for a second
24:39 - because that's what i like to do
24:40 - sometimes and i'm really curious kind of
24:42 - to your point christine
24:43 - how do you deal with that self-care
24:45 - piece of it right i mean what are the
24:47 - things between the two of you that you
24:49 - really
24:49 - um do in order to stay motivated in
24:52 - order to make sure that you can
24:54 - um kind of take care of yourself because
24:56 - i think there you know in college there
24:58 - are a lot of those sleepless nights
25:00 - and really tough exams and you know
25:02 - moments that you think man how am i
25:04 - actually going to get through
25:05 - through this and so for you both of you
25:08 - i'm really really curious how
25:10 - you really dealt with the self-care part
25:12 - of it
25:14 - as you went through college um
25:18 - let's see my sister will tell you that
25:22 - she was my crying shoulder
25:23 - um but i think it's like i having a
25:26 - support system
25:27 - um really knowing like having people you
25:30 - can really turn to and be like listen i
25:31 - really had a hard day like i just need
25:33 - to
25:34 - have ice cream and just binge watch
25:35 - something um
25:37 - and yeah so like a support system um
25:41 - and if not that also just being kind to
25:44 - yourself
25:44 - um realizing okay you know what this
25:47 - saturday i'm gonna close my laptop close
25:49 - my books
25:49 - go for a run do what i need to do to
25:51 - relax um
25:53 - yeah being like just kind with yourself
25:55 - but also accountable you know be like
25:56 - okay saturday i took a day off sunday
25:58 - i'm going to get back to it
25:59 - um so yeah yeah
26:02 - kelsey what do you what did you do in
26:03 - college to self-care
26:05 - so a lot of my friends were kind of in
26:08 - the same course
26:09 - so whenever we had exams wherever we had
26:11 - projects that were just so
26:13 - mind-boggling that once it was done we'd
26:15 - all get together and just be like
26:17 - oh it's done like yeah we're free and
26:19 - just have you know just to talk to each
26:21 - other and express like what we're the
26:23 - like the really
26:24 - hard things and how did they come and
26:26 - and compare
26:27 - and so it's kind of a way to de-stress
26:29 - after you've been ramping this dress the
26:31 - whole you know quarter basically
26:33 - um so that's kind of one thing that i
26:35 - did in in college is definitely finding
26:37 - people that
26:38 - can sympathize with what you're going to
26:40 - you don't want to
26:41 - express your you know stress to someone
26:44 - who's
26:45 - partying all the time like that's not
26:46 - going to help you need to you know
26:48 - find someone that also is kind of around
26:50 - the same point you are
26:51 - and maybe build off each other and say
26:53 - hey look i think you you you should try
26:55 - focusing on this next time and work from
26:57 - there
26:58 - um but i also agree that taking like a
27:00 - day off is is really good
27:02 - but be accountable you know make sure
27:04 - that
27:05 - just because you took a day off doesn't
27:06 - mean that you you should continue it uh
27:09 - it's just
27:10 - a good time to take care of yourself uh
27:12 - maybe watch shows go hang with friends
27:14 - so you can ignore
27:16 - the stress but uh definitely get back on
27:18 - it because it's a slippery slope when
27:20 - you stop
27:20 - wearing it things build up really
27:23 - quickly
27:24 - yeah yeah that thing don't go away
27:27 - exactly it's going to be there tomorrow
27:30 - it certainly is going to be there
27:31 - tomorrow so
27:33 - take your moment take a day to yourself
27:35 - but get back on that horse and make sure
27:37 - that you stay
27:38 - focused yeah i i baked cookies for my
27:41 - floor
27:44 - just what i do so that was my self-care
27:49 - was baking cookies and eating them
27:51 - [Laughter]
27:54 - probably not the best decision but it
27:56 - was okay
27:58 - the next question is from maria m um the
28:01 - question
28:02 - is with computer science core uh classes
28:04 - becoming more intense
28:05 - every year um how do you balance taking
28:08 - several
28:08 - challenging classes each semester at
28:11 - once without confusing the information
28:13 - during exams that's a really great
28:15 - question
28:16 - um and maybe christine if you want to
28:17 - maybe uh jump in on that one first
28:20 - okay that's an interesting question i've
28:22 - never even thought about
28:24 - like um i think once you get into the
28:27 - classes
28:28 - um you do see differences so like some
28:31 - things will be more
28:32 - algorithms other things um
28:35 - i think it's like a per class basis it
28:38 - might not happen as
28:39 - frequently as you think to confuse
28:41 - information
28:42 - um but
28:45 - let's see yeah
28:48 - so i yeah that's what i'd say
28:52 - i like it no i and i think that you're
28:54 - spot on i think that
28:56 - i think that people think that it's
28:58 - going to be one of those things where
28:59 - you confuse things more than you
29:01 - maybe do in a way um kelsey what's your
29:04 - insight on that question how might have
29:05 - you uh kind of kept some of that
29:07 - information separate
29:09 - yeah i'm trying to think of a time where
29:10 - i was in an exam and i wrote down
29:12 - another exam and i don't think i've had
29:16 - something like that i may have spent
29:18 - more time studying one topic
29:20 - over the other that i can see i
29:22 - definitely probably have done
29:24 - um but i think to that extent if for
29:26 - some reason you have exams on the same
29:28 - day
29:29 - let's say final exams and they're like
29:31 - back to back sometimes you can talk to
29:32 - the professor and ask them like look i
29:34 - have these two exams right next to each
29:36 - other and they're very hard like
29:38 - can i push one forward uh usually
29:40 - they're they're
29:41 - pretty lenient on that if you really
29:43 - explain um that they're tough classes
29:45 - and you need
29:46 - a break in between because three hour
29:48 - final exams are
29:50 - kill your brain slowly
29:55 - yeah i think i think that's spot on as
29:57 - well you know i think one of the things
29:58 - that i always recommend to students
30:00 - um just in general and it's a good habit
30:02 - to get into is just
30:03 - continue as you are if you're in high
30:06 - school um and you're working towards
30:07 - college or maybe you're in college and
30:09 - you're working kind of towards
30:10 - graduation
30:11 - you know i think the the continued focus
30:13 - on organization
30:14 - and how you structure your day and
30:17 - structure
30:18 - um you know what it is that you're doing
30:19 - on a regular basis you know i
30:22 - um always tell folks and this was the
30:24 - lesson that i learned after my 1.8 gpa
30:27 - semester that i had
30:28 - um but i learned that your education
30:30 - should be a full-time job
30:32 - that is what you are in college to do
30:33 - right you're there
30:35 - um to get that degree and so from nine
30:37 - to five you should be working on or
30:39 - whatever that eight hour time slot is
30:41 - during the day
30:42 - you really should be focusing on um your
30:45 - academics and so that structure
30:48 - i think sometimes can help folks when it
30:50 - comes to
30:51 - um balancing maybe material in different
30:53 - classes too
30:54 - yeah um we have another question and
30:57 - it's from christina y
30:59 - um and the question is in many of my
31:01 - major classes i have noticed people are
31:03 - either already extremely familiar with
31:05 - the material
31:06 - or they're quick learners which makes me
31:08 - nervous about my career choice
31:11 - how much prior coding experience is
31:13 - needed to successfully land
31:15 - an internship or a job and so
31:18 - kelsey i don't know if you have any
31:20 - insight on that piece of it
31:22 - so i think it kind of goes along with uh
31:24 - don't compare yourself
31:26 - i know there i have many classes where
31:28 - people have come in knowing pretty much
31:30 - the whole content of the class or having
31:32 - the previous exams
31:34 - and using that as a reference so you
31:36 - know there's no point in comparing with
31:38 - them they have already have a leg up
31:40 - you just need to focus on understanding
31:42 - the material because
31:43 - professors design the class for you know
31:46 - entry
31:47 - people to understand it so if it says
31:50 - you require a specific knowledge
31:51 - beforehand
31:52 - then maybe you should but if it doesn't
31:54 - say any knowledge is required then
31:56 - i think uh going into it without any
32:00 - prior knowledge is totally fine as long
32:01 - as you you know put in the effort for it
32:03 - um for prior coding experience
32:07 - um since i didn't really have that much
32:09 - other than coursework i really can't
32:11 - comment too much on this but i
32:12 - definitely think that having any
32:15 - sort of coding language in your you know
32:17 - back pocket is a plus because
32:19 - everywhere every company wants to be
32:21 - efficient and they can always do that by
32:23 - scripting so that's what i learned in my
32:25 - current job that you know having some
32:27 - fundamentals of understanding how to
32:30 - write a code
32:31 - read someone else's code um is really
32:33 - important uh
32:34 - and you know if it says only job
32:37 - description
32:38 - no coding then maybe you should take you
32:39 - know a couple hours to refresh
32:41 - but that's that's all i can say that's
32:44 - great what about you christine any
32:46 - advice one um
32:47 - on that yeah i mean i think
32:51 - like some coding experiences
32:55 - needed necessary just to like be able to
32:57 - like
32:58 - have a conversation and really
32:59 - understand but a lot of times like i've
33:02 - just seen in like the real world
33:04 - you learn on the job like you learn and
33:06 - people are there
33:08 - like i was in my first job i remember i
33:11 - was like so scared like
33:12 - my first task like not to ask questions
33:14 - and my
33:16 - um my manager was like if you have any
33:18 - questions ask me and then i was like
33:19 - wait do you really mean that
33:20 - like i don't get like i thought like i
33:24 - was going to be punished you know
33:25 - because i didn't know something and he
33:26 - was like no we're a teen
33:28 - so i think like post college um
33:31 - you get more into like we're just it's
33:34 - not they're not necessarily out looking
33:35 - at you
33:36 - they're just trying to finish a task so
33:39 - and the more that you can communicate
33:40 - the more
33:41 - um the better you could communicate like
33:44 - what you know and what you don't know
33:46 - that's also really important because a
33:48 - you learn and b do whatever you're doing
33:49 - better
33:50 - um so yeah so a lot of the real world
33:53 - you learn on the job
33:54 - so yeah it's it's true um you know i
33:57 - think internships obviously are
33:58 - important to have some sort of skill set
34:00 - to offer for
34:02 - you know whatever that that internship
34:03 - is um but that's supposed to be a
34:05 - learning experience
34:06 - internships are designed to help you
34:09 - learn
34:10 - um about a particular industry or better
34:12 - about a particular field and so
34:14 - you're right i mean there is a lot of
34:16 - that that really occurs um
34:17 - kind of on the fly on the job um i'm
34:20 - gonna add
34:21 - in a question here um do you have any
34:24 - advice this was a really interesting one
34:26 - through our q a
34:27 - um do you have any advice for someone
34:28 - who might be getting uh
34:30 - bullied or picked on for being a girl in
34:33 - computer science
34:34 - and is that something that either of you
34:35 - have really dealt with
34:39 - i i don't maybe they said it behind my
34:42 - back but i just wasn't paying attention
34:44 - but uh
34:44 - no one has ever verbally said it to me
34:48 - um but you definitely get looks you know
34:50 - that that's
34:51 - you go into a room with mainly men like
34:53 - you're gonna get looks and uh
34:54 - unfortunate that you know things like
34:56 - this do happen but
34:58 - i would have to say you know they're
34:59 - just jealous you know you're a female
35:02 - you know you you're in
35:03 - and you're threatening almost in a way
35:05 - so just
35:06 - remember that you know and uh try to
35:08 - find people to support you have your
35:10 - back
35:11 - uh it may be hard in the beginning but
35:12 - you'll find them you'll find your crew
35:14 - that's true love that christine any
35:16 - additions to that
35:18 - yeah i mean you have to for us to like
35:21 - really
35:21 - like make a difference we have to be
35:23 - present you know so i remember one time
35:26 - i was i was at a tech talk and this is
35:28 - like the
35:29 - my first and only experience but it
35:30 - shook me um
35:32 - i was at a tech talk and i was standing
35:33 - in the back so i just come from work
35:35 - and i remember a guy came up to me and
35:37 - he was like hey do you know where i can
35:39 - get more napkins
35:40 - and he thought i was like there to
35:42 - assist with the program
35:44 - and it just shook me because i hadn't
35:45 - experienced that in my life and i was
35:47 - like
35:47 - okay okay well um
35:51 - no i was like well i'm attending it too
35:53 - but
35:54 - you can ask you know like i'm sure you
35:56 - can find them there um so
35:58 - i think just being present is like
36:01 - lesson enough you know so i would just
36:04 - like it's more yeah
36:08 - it's more impactful just being there
36:10 - than even saying anything
36:12 - and like let these men know that girls
36:15 - run
36:15 - the world like i just it just really
36:19 - bothers me
36:19 - i i'm not gonna go on a soapbox about my
36:23 - feelings
36:24 - about all of this but like we need to
36:27 - let women run the world that that's like
36:29 - just what needs to happen
36:30 - and so um hold your head up high
36:34 - keep moving forward like do you is what
36:37 - i say like do you be in that room
36:39 - and i and again i i you know it's
36:42 - definitely different but similarly being
36:44 - a black man being a gay man
36:46 - um being um you know someone young
36:49 - relatively young in my position like you
36:51 - just have to go in and know that people
36:52 - are going to talk and at the end of the
36:54 - day
36:55 - you're there for a reason you were hired
36:57 - for your job for a reason
36:58 - you got admitted into your school for a
37:00 - reason and like
37:02 - go and just do you like live your life
37:05 - um i had to say that out loud okay
37:08 - we have about three ish minutes left for
37:10 - questions so i'm gonna at least pull um
37:11 - at least one more
37:12 - um aren't there any resources or
37:15 - materials or
37:16 - tools that you would recommend for
37:18 - college students who are
37:19 - in tech that you have seen that's maybe
37:23 - been a lifesaver for you
37:25 - um maybe through your college years or
37:27 - after you graduated from college in
37:28 - terms of tools resources
37:30 - materials books anything like that
37:35 - uh for me personally i it seems strange
37:38 - but youtube
37:39 - uh if you definitely need help like a
37:41 - math problem and a
37:42 - you know physics problem or anything
37:44 - like that or coding problem
37:45 - if you go on youtube and type kind of
37:47 - similar you know something similar to
37:49 - what the problem
37:50 - is you'll find a step-by-step by someone
37:52 - usually on a whiteboard kind of going
37:53 - over it so
37:54 - you know it's free uh i mean there's
37:56 - some ads but you
37:57 - you don't get around those but uh yeah
38:00 - definitely youtube
38:01 - anyone can use it so yeah um for
38:05 - coding i really like udemy um i
38:08 - i know a lot of schools might have like
38:11 - can get you through a discount or
38:12 - something
38:13 - but that if you want like just like to
38:15 - learn something really quickly
38:16 - they their classes are organized really
38:19 - well
38:20 - um if you have maybe like a day like
38:22 - some classes can be like a python class
38:24 - javascript react
38:26 - it can be like a week of just make
38:28 - making an intense schedule for yourself
38:30 - they're
38:30 - really helpful they go through the
38:32 - basics really well so it's udemy
38:34 - udemy love it love resources like that
38:39 - and again i think continuing to check
38:40 - with your i'm gonna plug career centers
38:42 - again because they're
38:43 - one of my favorites a lot of resources
38:45 - there a lot of resources through college
38:47 - libraries
38:49 - a lot of free resources that they really
38:51 - have to offer for students
38:53 - always something to think about your
38:55 - professors in their office hours
38:56 - go to your professor's office hours
39:00 - go talk to your professors like
39:04 - yeah how often did you all do office
39:05 - hours with your professors would you say
39:07 - that was a pretty frequent occurrence or
39:10 - usually when you just needed something
39:11 - or how did that work for you
39:14 - so definitely oh go ahead christine go
39:17 - um no i remember i found out about
39:19 - office hours a little too late until
39:21 - like my
39:22 - end of like second semester junior year
39:24 - and i was like
39:25 - what um so i wish i learned knew sooner
39:29 - that my professors were just there
39:30 - literally as
39:32 - questions um so yes do office hours
39:37 - go ahead kelsey um yeah definitely same
39:40 - thing i
39:40 - didn't really use it during my undergrad
39:43 - i really regret it now because i used it
39:44 - a lot during my master's because
39:46 - i just needed that extra help and they
39:48 - were willing and there were tas that
39:50 - also were helpful
39:51 - so definitely don't be afraid like even
39:53 - if you come in and you think that you're
39:54 - gonna ask some silly questions
39:56 - and they're gonna look down on you like
39:57 - they won't they'll walk you through it i
39:59 - mean they're there to help
40:01 - um and definitely if at the end of the
40:03 - you know quarter or semester
40:05 - you finally decide to go see the
40:06 - professor and you ask for help they're
40:08 - gonna wonder
40:09 - where were you during the whole semester
40:11 - so definitely try to show face
40:13 - you know a little bit of the time uh
40:16 - just so at the end you can be like i've
40:18 - been there i need help please
40:19 - so just and just to clarify office hours
40:23 - for anyone who doesn't know who's not
40:24 - quite yet in college a lot of professors
40:26 - will hold times during the week that
40:28 - students can walk in
40:30 - um and ask questions or chat or get help
40:33 - on homework
40:34 - or on the readings so definitely take
40:37 - advantage of
40:38 - office hours we're going to ask one more
40:40 - question i think this is kind of a fun
40:41 - one
40:42 - to end on um and the question is if you
40:45 - had to pick another professional
40:47 - field what would it be
40:51 - and let's start with kelsey if you had
40:54 - to pick
40:54 - another field to be in what do you think
40:58 - that might
40:58 - might be for you um
41:02 - i think maybe going towards like either
41:05 - i have
41:06 - two two different like in my mind so one
41:09 - would be medicine because i was always
41:10 - fascinated with it but i just i can't
41:12 - grasp my head around chemistry it's just
41:15 - too i don't know why
41:16 - that one just bothered me um
41:19 - but then also business because i didn't
41:22 - realize
41:23 - how comfortable i am more or less kind
41:26 - of talking to people
41:28 - and i think business has a lot of that
41:29 - aspect as an engineer you may not get
41:31 - that much experience you know
41:33 - presenting or or talking to groups or
41:36 - projects so uh definitely maybe
41:39 - marketing kind of that sort of concept
41:41 - uh
41:41 - it's kind of interesting to me right now
41:44 - but uh definitely those two but
41:45 - it's very very different i love that
41:48 - though christine what about you what
41:49 - would you do
41:51 - um well
41:54 - probably i'd want to do something
41:57 - related with english and like poetry
41:59 - so like being a writer um yeah i find
42:03 - that
42:03 - i mean i'm interested in psychology and
42:06 - like reading that kind of stuff so
42:08 - i'd ha very different very different but
42:11 - total the other side but i'd probably do
42:13 - like poetry be a writer
42:15 - yeah yeah those are awesome fields i
42:17 - like that
42:18 - i would go i've always wanted to do
42:20 - urban planning which is so weird
42:22 - um but like i'm so interested in how
42:25 - cities um you know thinking about coding
42:29 - and buildings and um you know how do you
42:32 - how do you really structure cities in
42:33 - such a way to really serve
42:36 - um the population in a really effective
42:38 - way and so i've always wanted to go back
42:40 - to school for urban planning
42:42 - and never have and probably never will
42:44 - but uh it would be fun you never know
42:46 - you never know right it might happen one
42:49 - day yeah
42:50 - for sure it's so intriguing to me so
42:53 - uh well awesome well thank you all so
42:55 - much those were really really really
42:57 - great
42:58 - um insights that both of you really had
