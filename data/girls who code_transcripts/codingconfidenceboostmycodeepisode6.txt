00:06 - hi there it's Brittany it's Janet it's
00:09 - Audrey it's Margot and it's time for a
00:11 - coding confidence boost in this week's
00:13 - episode of my code we're going to be
00:15 - talking about how coding has made us a
00:16 - lot more confident as well as addressing
00:18 - the naysayers who say coding is hard
00:20 - anyone can do it
00:22 - so let's go coding isn't hard like
00:27 - anything you do you have to practice to
00:29 - get better once you know the basics of
00:31 - just one language it is so easy to learn
00:34 - more coding ones like a bunch of words
00:35 - and letters all jumbled together making
00:38 - it seem more confusing for others but
00:40 - you do not need to be a genius to do it
00:42 - as you keep on practicing and learning
00:43 - the easier it is to understand unlike
00:46 - most spoken languages coder always has
00:48 - explicitly defined rules with no
00:50 - exceptions and it always makes perfect
00:52 - logical sense if you keep on going
00:54 - coding can be a breeze people say coding
00:59 - is hard because the media portrays it as
01:01 - an advanced and technical stuff that
01:03 - only matching ESA's can create most
01:04 - people use technologies every day that
01:06 - they don't understand and because they
01:08 - don't understand them they tend to fear
01:10 - them and think they're really
01:11 - complicated coding isn't very hard to me
01:13 - and it's funny saying that now because
01:15 - if you ask me that when I first started
01:16 - learning how to code I would have said
01:18 - that it definitely was hard if you don't
01:20 - let those setbacks get in your way
01:22 - coding can be much easier
01:26 - cody has taught me how to deal with
01:28 - failure to keep moving forward sometimes
01:30 - when I find a major bug or something
01:32 - wrong with my program I feel just want
01:33 - to give up and delete the whole thing
01:35 - and start over from scratch it takes
01:36 - tons of trial and error to get the right
01:39 - commands in the right place with
01:40 - sometimes just a semicolon meaning all
01:42 - the difference and other times you just
01:44 - have to keep trying until you get your
01:46 - code to work the way you want it to
01:48 - I think coding us taught me that the
01:49 - only definition of failure is the one I
01:52 - create for myself coding has taught me
01:53 - that failing is OK in fact failing is a
01:56 - step toward success as long as you keep
01:59 - on trying and you keep persisting you
02:01 - can never fail it's important to just
02:03 - keep pushing forward moving through your
02:04 - problems and trying to work them out
02:05 - instead of giving up coding has given me
02:10 - a confidence boost like no other when I
02:12 - show my parents or my friends the stuff
02:14 - I've coded they always say wow you made
02:16 - that it's kind of cool seeing how people
02:18 - look at me like some sort of super
02:20 - genius for knowing how to code before I
02:22 - wasn't okay with failing whenever I ran
02:24 - into an error I would always be
02:25 - frustrated and angry because I couldn't
02:28 - get my code to function even though I'm
02:30 - not coding all the time I'm usually
02:31 - dreaming about new programs and new
02:33 - games that I can make and now that I
02:35 - know how to code I don't have to just
02:36 - scream about them I bought my laptop and
02:38 - get started on our project right then
02:39 - and there yes it's a lot of perseverance
02:41 - but we're here to tell you don't give up
02:44 - even master programmers face errors in
02:47 - their code but it's only up to you to
02:49 - take the challenge next week we'll be
02:51 - back to talk about how code is changing
02:53 - the world and how we're using it to give
02:55 - back to our communities
