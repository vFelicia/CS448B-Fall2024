00:00 - welcome to another day in the lab today
00:02 - we are going to be using the kaijin D
00:04 - and easy power soil kit to extract DNA
00:06 - for my soil samples I always start off
00:08 - by rewriting down the protocol that
00:10 - comes with a kit but in a way that I can
00:12 - understand and I set up all of my
00:14 - reagents in the order that I'm going to
00:16 - need them in throughout the protocol
00:17 - before getting started I always
00:20 - pre-label all of my tubes on the top and
00:22 - on the side and I set up my tubes from
00:24 - left to right top to bottom after
00:26 - setting up my tubes and reagents I go
00:28 - ahead and I grab the pipette tips that
00:30 - I'm going to need as well as the
00:31 - pipettes setting everything up ahead of
00:34 - time just lowers the chances of me
00:35 - messing up and then I just continue with
00:37 - the protocol always checking off each
00:39 - step as I go along so that I don't lose
00:41 - my spot which is actually really easy to
00:43 - do rest me I can't tell you how many
00:46 - times I've messed up before sometimes
00:48 - working with kids can be a little bit
00:50 - intimidating but little things like
00:52 - rewriting the protocol setting up ahead
00:54 - of time and pre-labeling can really make
00:56 - a difference and look at that we're done
00:58 - that wasn't that bad was it
