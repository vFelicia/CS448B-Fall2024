00:00 - my name is fetish day from I'm the
00:02 - founder and executive director of coach
00:04 - inspire rarely opened the first computer
00:07 - coding school for girls in Afghanistan
00:09 - my name is a beautiful and I couldn't
00:12 - called non-russian for all that finds
00:15 - gender-neutral restrooms anywhere in
00:16 - America well anyway there's a whole
00:19 - entire story behind it and I can't wait
00:21 - to continue talking to you about it why
00:26 - you get it started with coding like how
00:29 - did you get excited about being a coder
00:31 - and what was that aha moment for you to
00:34 - think up you know I think I'd like I'd
00:37 - love coding and I found like the way
00:39 - that I want to pursue my career so I
00:41 - love math before and I took a bunch of
00:44 - math classes in high school but I never
00:45 - knew how like I could combine my love
00:47 - for activism and mathematics it just
00:50 - doesn't like click click but once I
00:53 - found computer science through the
00:54 - program I realized computer science
00:57 - mathematics activism you can play a huge
01:00 - role in them you can make so much you
01:01 - can make a huge difference in the lives
01:03 - of others through computer science of
01:05 - using mathematics and activism so there
01:08 - are a lot of tools I think that human
01:11 - beings if we use them in a proper way
01:13 - they can be very empowering to us and
01:16 - very supportive to particular problems
01:18 - that we may facing in a society so how
01:23 - do you think your personal experience
01:25 - coding newly empowered you and gave you
01:29 - this disability that you can do and you
01:34 - can be empowered not only yourself but
01:37 - you can empower others what was your
01:39 - feeling about that so I learned how to
01:42 - code nine weeks before I made the GNR so
01:46 - I could see I I know the difference I
01:48 - made something like I know that even in
01:50 - nine weeks computer science give me that
01:52 - much power and so like I don't know I
01:55 - try to tell people like it wasn't like
01:57 - complex or an algorithm or anything like
01:59 - that it was just simply using an API if
02:02 - I can do that in nine weeks you can do
02:04 - anything and like at a span of like 100
02:07 - 200 or however long you live so
02:11 - I wonder if through the coding projects
02:14 - you've done so far the programs we have
02:16 - done so far do you did it happen did it
02:22 - give you another perspective or a new
02:24 - perspective about what's going on
02:27 - outside of the world or it open your
02:29 - eyes of what's happening in the world
02:32 - around you so talking about GNR I went
02:39 - so we want the congressional app
02:40 - challenge for our congressional district
02:43 - and we went to the Capitol Hill and what
02:47 - happened was okay we were standing next
02:51 - to a bunch of Republicans and
02:53 - Republicans but let's say every district
02:56 - there's a bunch of districts and we were
02:58 - next to like Arkansas or something like
03:00 - that and they would look at our app and
03:02 - they would just like smile and nod and
03:04 - like not like not even like ask for like
03:08 - give us our your presentation oh it's
03:10 - self the meaning is all of us were all
03:13 - to be teachers and one of the reason why
03:16 - we created the app in the first place
03:17 - was because a simple thing my friend
03:19 - couldn't find a restroom to go to that
03:21 - was gender neutral in it they didn't
03:23 - feel comfortable going to the restroom
03:24 - and like and just fall into a restaurant
03:27 - it should not be a difficult thing to do
03:29 - so yeah just like going to see like the
03:33 - most of the country most of the world is
03:35 - not that accepting and I live in a place
03:37 - that is very something and I have to
03:40 - learn to like be able to like see sensor
03:43 - like not censor myself but like see see
03:45 - the eyes of other people for you like
03:47 - how did you get started with coding um
03:51 - so with the the school the code to
03:53 - inspire your patient yeah so definitely
03:57 - for me I think the main important reason
04:00 - and inspiration was being born as a
04:03 - refugee so I was born as a refugee in
04:05 - Iran during the Soviet invasion my
04:08 - parents fled Afghanistan and they moved
04:10 - to Iran and so growing up in as a
04:15 - refugee there are a lot of
04:16 - that you're fixing and one of the
04:18 - challenges that I was facing and a lot
04:20 - of refugees as well as accessing
04:22 - education so we have to show proper
04:25 - papers to the schools that they could
04:28 - enroll us if you wouldn't able to show
04:31 - that paper we weren't able to be at the
04:32 - school so that was a big challenge every
04:35 - year with the fear of going to school
04:38 - was with me and then when we moved to
04:41 - Afghanistan one year after the fall of
04:43 - Taliban I got into computer science I
04:48 - got my bachelor's and being a woman in
04:51 - tech and you're talking about
04:53 - Afghanistan after Taliban there's a lot
04:55 - of challenges social limitations and
04:58 - push backs so these reasons really made
05:00 - me to think about how I can improve the
05:02 - situation of women not only being
05:05 - studying in a safe space but also giving
05:08 - them resources that they can use that
05:11 - resources to learn a skill that they can
05:13 - make money and bring income to the
05:16 - families so that was the main motivation
05:18 - and inspiration for me to open first
05:21 - computer coding school for girls in
05:23 - Afghanistan I know you could do that or
05:26 - like what gave you like I don't know I
05:29 - guess what's your aha moment that
05:31 - brought you to like found this huge Berg
05:33 - I mean this organization that's amazing
05:35 - yeah well I think again like my wife
05:40 - story being born I think a woman from
05:43 - Afghanistan meaning a woman in
05:46 - technology and just experiencing how
05:51 - technology is very powerful because when
05:54 - I came to the US and I wasn't able to go
05:58 - back to Afghanistan because of my
06:00 - immigration situation I did everything
06:04 - online
06:04 - I used technology as a tool that
06:07 - empowered me to do everything online so
06:09 - I did the organization online I shifted
06:13 - equipments recruit the students finding
06:15 - mentors designing curriculum so for me
06:19 - it's fascinating to see as a refugee
06:22 - born who was deprived accessing
06:24 - education how a tool like technology can
06:27 - help me to give back to my community and
06:30 - to tackle that problem in a way that
06:32 - women would be able to pursue what they
06:36 - want in a safe space that's amazing so
06:41 - how would you say that do you use code
06:44 - to connect girls globally yes um that's
06:47 - a great question because when you talk
06:51 - about technology you're not talking
06:53 - about
06:54 - country's geographical boundaries you're
06:57 - talking about its digital world that
06:59 - everyone can be a part of it without
07:01 - considering any geographical boundaries
07:04 - so it can be a digital citizen of the
07:06 - world without considering all those
07:08 - limitations and that's the beauty of
07:11 - technology that can connect people
07:12 - around the world without asking you we
07:16 - have a passport but you can pass this
07:18 - border so you can pass orders without
07:20 - requiring any papers and for the girls
07:24 - in our school definitely not only to
07:28 - open their eyes what's happening outside
07:31 - Afghanistan and what the world looks
07:33 - like especially for women in technology
07:35 - and things that women accomplish so far
07:39 - but also like give them a platform that
07:43 - through the skills they can connected a
07:46 - global market and applying jobs as
07:49 - freelancers work and get paid so that
07:52 - they can be financially in a better
07:54 - position so to make that happen
07:58 - that was a long journey and gain talking
08:00 - about a girl coming through our school
08:02 - I've never touched a computer in
08:03 - Aberdeen online but now talking about
08:06 - the girl then create a website and we
08:08 - can get paid by making that happen and
08:10 - you inspire me I just wanted to say um
08:13 - would you say you always had this get
08:16 - the skill to do all of this what like
08:18 - what helped you build that like how can
08:20 - somebody become like like you what do
08:23 - you have any tips for them in well I
08:25 - think part of it is personal yeah
08:28 - what are your motivation factors and
08:31 - what motivates you to to drive you to do
08:36 - you love about and what you want to make
08:38 - a change but but also I think I always
08:41 - tell friends that I'm a risk-taker so
08:43 - I'm not afraid of risks and challenges
08:46 - if I feel I want to do something I go
08:49 - for it and if you are with a good
08:51 - intention everything really comes
08:52 - together the most important thing that I
08:54 - would suggest is that um don't wait and
08:58 - sit on your ideas if you really feel
09:01 - about your idea and you want to make it
09:04 - happen make it happen and then don't
09:05 - want life sit down on it and just give
09:08 - you time and surround yourself with
09:11 - people who are the same passion as words
09:13 - this is very important to build a
09:15 - community around yourself especially
09:19 - when we talk about activism and
09:21 - technology and bring changes in the
09:23 - community when you have people around
09:25 - yourself that they have the same passion
09:26 - as you then you avoid so you hear it
09:29 - louder and you will have more support so
09:33 - that's definitely the rest to be honest
09:37 - it just like you have to reach as many
09:39 - as people you can and never be afraid of
09:41 - if they say no they're not interested or
09:44 - no they're not able to help just move on
09:46 - and believe in what you're doing and you
09:49 - make it happen
09:50 - I actually I surround myself I through
09:54 - the girls are code I love the
09:56 - organization just because the alumni
09:58 - network and like not even just the
09:59 - alumni network well what it cost a few
10:01 - it's like who you surround yourself with
10:03 - all these girls who are passionate about
10:04 - computing that's not very common I
10:07 - realized after like stepping outside of
10:08 - it would you say that or your lawyer
10:11 - girls in one location or like are they
10:13 - in separate locations and do they
10:15 - communicate in any way or how do they
10:16 - get to know each other right well we do
10:19 - have now one location right now it's
10:21 - Amelie in Herat it's the city in western
10:23 - Afghanistan and Liv educated about 150
10:27 - girls so far in the school and they're
10:30 - all in same place what would we always
10:33 - try to do and I always try to push as
10:35 - the sister would make the girls eat
10:37 - together
10:38 - make the girls to communicate with each
10:40 - other if they have ideas sharing with
10:42 - their peers and that's the kind of
10:45 - warranty receiving and our students did
10:48 - an amazing job creating a lot of awesome
10:51 - games that were geared towards the
10:53 - issues that people were facing and in
10:55 - society and Afghanistan so so to me I
10:59 - think that providing that safe space for
11:01 - the girls to come together to not being
11:05 - afraid of raising their voice and to
11:07 - feel there's like a sisterhood here and
11:09 - there are others that they support was
11:11 - the force that they were able to
11:13 - actually do the things that they've
11:15 - never been able to do before and make
11:18 - that change in the community
11:20 - yeah I give some a lot of power I know
11:23 - the difference between a girl who I mean
11:25 - like me going through the program I
11:28 - change dramatically my whole class
11:29 - change dramatically coding it makes a
11:31 - huge difference would you say that I see
11:35 - you you've got you got into college for
11:37 - computer science you say did you face
11:39 - any challenges going in like were you
11:41 - the only female in the class or like how
11:43 - did you how did you face those obstacles
11:44 - or get over the feeling if you did yes
11:48 - um so when you move to Afghanistan in
11:51 - 2002 that was when one year after the
11:53 - fall of Salomon so the infrastructure
11:55 - wasn't really ready for a lot of weren't
11:58 - suspicions with education but the city
12:00 - that I'm from arrived was one of the
12:03 - safest city that time so when I got into
12:06 - computer science to have my bachelor or
12:09 - we had a big class of probably 80
12:11 - students and out of that 80 probably
12:14 - 1011 were girls that not all of them
12:18 - make it again of the of the class so
12:22 - definitely for me to be a period was
12:25 - very active very vocal I was always
12:27 - interested to do a lot of social work
12:31 - and bring changes in the community with
12:34 - the work that I'm doing and not a lot of
12:37 - people like that and not a lot of people
12:39 - who like to see that time a girl to be
12:42 - that active I was against that
12:46 - traditions and the culture at that time
12:49 - the women supposed to be home and not
12:52 - working you know not being that active
12:54 - and I
12:55 - like that so I faced a lot of backlashes
12:58 - from the community from my classmates in
13:01 - this school but again the most important
13:04 - factor for me was sisterhood finding the
13:09 - girls who have the same passion and
13:10 - voices me and also my family was very
13:14 - supportive from the very first day my
13:17 - family invest on their girls education a
13:19 - lot and that's the two things that made
13:22 - me to be able to go through all the
13:25 - challenges and obstacles that I was
13:26 - raising well well I think in Afghanistan
13:30 - that situation must be a bit different
13:32 - because again we were talking about a
13:34 - country that went through war with the
13:37 - case and there's a lot of issues but I'm
13:39 - I'm more interested to know about you as
13:43 - a girl in coding and technology and
13:47 - living in the United States what were
13:50 - the other challenges what were the
13:52 - things that you faced when you wanted to
13:54 - learn and what was the perspective of
13:57 - the community around you about women
14:01 - so my actually you talk about your
14:04 - parents supporting you my parents were
14:06 - kind of like the opposite they were more
14:07 - about females either be a doctor like
14:10 - nurse and go into like the medical
14:13 - profession and they believe you can be
14:16 - smart they just think that computer
14:17 - science is reserved for males because
14:21 - you don't take a shower like that's what
14:22 - they told me they're like are you sure
14:23 - you want to do this this is not like and
14:26 - then the coding camp they didn't want me
14:29 - to do it because yeah it's just no no I
14:35 - feel like other issue that came up was
14:38 - like being at home and being like this
14:40 - stay-at-home mom was a very still
14:42 - relevant thing my family is like super
14:44 - conservative and there's and so I faced
14:46 - the challenge of being like oh I'm I'm
14:48 - like a queer woman and I I do all these
14:51 - like the extended neutral restroom app
14:53 - like benefits me as well but they didn't
14:55 - see has a very good app because they're
14:57 - like why is this needed and I think I
15:00 - guess that's my internal struggle but
15:02 - like externally I think the world I've
15:04 - been in classes like discrete
15:06 - mathematics I took in high school
15:08 - where
15:09 - was like one of the - one of the three
15:10 - only females in the class and I would be
15:13 - afraid to talk to I'm the one who would
15:15 - normally speak out in class yes I agree
15:18 - that you think if you are the first in
15:20 - your family in your community about
15:23 - doing something that no one has done
15:25 - before
15:26 - you definitely face back legends because
15:29 - you're the one who is trying something
15:31 - that no one else has done and they're
15:34 - all like the thoughts and the ideas all
15:37 - of them have is that they they just
15:40 - afraid of it because they don't know it
15:42 - and I think again with the beauty of
15:45 - Technology is what you're doing and what
15:47 - you did you used your skills and you
15:50 - built an app because you saw that there
15:52 - is a challenge and there's a problem
15:54 - here your friends are facing and you
15:56 - were like well I have that skills and
15:58 - they can tackle that and anything again
16:01 - like that's how it will bring all of us
16:04 - together as a community together - and
16:07 - globally connected when there is a
16:09 - problem and then we can come up with a
16:11 - solution of that perfect so I think well
16:17 - the things about connecting the girls
16:20 - globally which again based on my
16:22 - experience again like I think this is
16:24 - happening right now I'm talking to you
16:27 - so I think like globally like we are
16:30 - from different countries we grew up
16:32 - different but with using technology you
16:35 - and I are able now to have a
16:36 - conversation and get connected and
16:38 - shared thoughts so definitely using tech
16:42 - as a way that globally we can connect
16:45 - women and girls and everyone in the
16:47 - world will go back again to the idea of
16:50 - sister who it but in a modern way in a
16:53 - different way the moment and you and I
16:55 - now are talking together we both come
16:57 - from different backgrounds but we share
16:59 - the same passion we want to use
17:01 - technology we want to use coding to
17:03 - bring a change and awareness in the
17:04 - community and also to just create more
17:08 - role models or women in technology
17:11 - because they're not a lot of role models
17:12 - when a young girl
17:16 - is just like growing up and you ask them
17:18 - they can't name a lot of women and
17:20 - unfortunately that's the way that
17:24 - happens before so I'll move the
17:27 - technology again you don't need to have
17:30 - to grab for bad news and invitations
17:33 - computer to get online share your
17:36 - thoughts with people around the world
17:38 - and get connected and that's what we do
17:40 - create code to inspire and I think with
17:43 - your app and with the work you're doing
17:45 - that's the same message you wanna really
17:48 - send your message not to people in the
17:51 - US but to the world because the app that
17:54 - you created is not only community are
18:03 - facing in a lot of countries so not only
18:07 - you tackle the problem that useful new
18:09 - friends are thinking but you are
18:11 - addressing a problem so that's the
18:21 - answer could I ask you one more question
18:24 - yes okay um you're very good at speaking
18:28 - and like being able to articulate your
18:31 - words well do you have any
18:32 - recommendations for like like being able
18:35 - to do that better even I didn't notice
18:36 - not we're related to coding but why it
18:40 - was very afraid of public speaking and
18:51 - you'll you'll have to do that because of
18:54 - the work you're doing and to be honest I
18:57 - think there there are a lot of
18:59 - techniques out there people suggest you
19:01 - should go to public speaking classes
19:02 - people suggest like bring a crowd of
19:05 - your friends and family understand of
19:07 - and talk in front of them and talk in
19:09 - front of the mirror just as much as you
19:11 - can to practice so I think just like
19:16 - practice and time will improve that I
19:19 - wasn't very good as I mean I don't say
19:22 - that very good now but
19:23 - I think just if you go to more places
19:25 - talk more you did get through that and
19:28 - you're doing amazing and I'm pretty sure
19:30 - you'll do great so yeah just just do
19:35 - whatever makes you feel more comfortable
19:37 - about yourself and make that happen
19:43 - conversation thank you so much for
19:45 - having this conversation with me girls
19:47 - who code and the sisterhood is so happy
19:49 - to have you in it and I can't wait to
19:51 - get to know you better outside of this
19:53 - conversation all right it was a pleasure
19:55 - talking to you as well and I'm so
19:58 - grateful of knowing one more percent I'm
20:01 - still amazing and doing great work and
20:04 - coding and hopefully we'll continue our
20:07 - sister this together and we can come up
20:09 - with some other plans and plots thank
20:11 - you so much
20:12 - yeah thank you too
