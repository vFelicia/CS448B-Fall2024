00:08 - in our first 10 years as an organization
00:10 - girls who code has proven time and time
00:12 - again that we're about more than just
00:14 - teaching girls and non-binary students
00:16 - how to code we are growing a movement of
00:19 - over 450 000 students served now and
00:22 - counting my favorite thing from grocery
00:25 - code definitely has to be the community
00:27 - that we build really amazing to know
00:29 - that everyone around you is following a
00:31 - similar life path that you are or at
00:33 - least enjoy something that you do so
00:35 - there's always something to talk about
00:36 - when i was in high school i was
00:38 - interested in learning how to code so i
00:40 - joined the grocery code club at my
00:42 - library and those experiences allowed me
00:44 - to explore my interest in computer
00:46 - science and gave me the confidence to
00:49 - pursue a degree in computer science in
00:51 - college
00:52 - i graduated with that degree in may of
00:55 - 2021 and i'm really excited to start my
00:58 - first computer science job in just a
01:00 - couple weeks
01:02 - i got that job through a girls who code
01:04 - hiring summit and i'm just really
01:06 - grateful for the programs i got to
01:09 - attend and the support i received from
01:11 - girls who code because it really got me
01:13 - where i am today and it's just been
01:16 - so great being a part of such an amazing
01:18 - and supportive community i wouldn't be
01:20 - where i am today without girls who code
01:22 - i've always known that i had an interest
01:24 - in technology but i simply just didn't
01:26 - know where to start but after being
01:28 - introduced to girls to code it has
01:30 - unlocked the door to unendless
01:31 - possibilities in my career in high
01:33 - school i was very timid shy and felt
01:35 - like gender roles held me back from what
01:37 - i could and couldn't be
01:39 - but after finding the girls who code
01:40 - chapter and finding my community i was
01:43 - able to learn how to program become a
01:45 - teacher a mentor a public speaker and it
01:48 - led me to pursue computer science at uc
01:50 - berkeley in college
01:52 - now i'm a software engineer at microsoft
01:55 - and i'm so grateful for girls who code
01:56 - for being that community that let me
01:58 - know that it's okay to be myself
02:01 - and as a queer woman of color and
02:03 - someone with a disability this was so
02:05 - immensely important for me so in girls
02:07 - of code when i was in high school i had
02:09 - no knowledge of what computer science is
02:12 - and i realized that there's such an
02:13 - intersection between arts and tech and
02:16 - it's kind of like a
02:18 - big reason of why i decided to pursue it
02:20 - in college because i learned that oh my
02:23 - gosh i can
02:24 - do something that i really really love
02:26 - which is dance and be able to
02:28 - use cs as a tool to create a whole new
02:31 - version of storytelling you guys really
02:33 - impacted my life like in three main ways
02:36 - so first you guys inspire me every day
02:38 - with your social media um and your
02:40 - newsletter where you inform of what you
02:42 - do
02:43 - second you guys uh
02:45 - encouraged me to
02:47 - make or create a coding club for girls
02:50 - at my school
02:51 - using the code at home curriculum
02:54 - third of all you guys gave me the
02:56 - confidence to apply to a hackathon with
02:58 - my friend where we won
03:00 - the category for best health hack
03:03 - and you guys really turned my life
03:04 - around and i wouldn't be doing any of
03:06 - what i'm doing now if my mother had
03:09 - hadn't discovered you and said and
03:11 - shared you guys with me
03:12 - and i'm just so grateful
03:15 - [Music]
03:27 - you
