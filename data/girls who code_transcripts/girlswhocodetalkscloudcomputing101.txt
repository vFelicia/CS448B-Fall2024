03:38 - for you to
03:39 - introduce yourself and tell folks a
03:40 - little bit about you and your work
03:43 - and specifically like what do you do all
03:45 - day what does it mean to work in this
03:46 - field
03:47 - and i'd also like you to answer our ice
03:49 - breaker which is what is the best advice
03:52 - you've received from a mentor or manager
03:54 - take it away
03:55 - all right hello everyone thank you guys
03:57 - so much for having me i didn't realize
03:59 - that we would have people from literally
04:01 - all over the place
04:02 - um so i'm actually in west palm beach
04:04 - right now as well for whoever had
04:06 - commented that i'm so nice to see that
04:09 - there are other people from here dialing
04:10 - in
04:11 - i'm i'm currently at a financial
04:13 - services company called citadel
04:14 - securities
04:15 - i for them i help roll out and manage
04:17 - technical programs across various
04:19 - elements of our business
04:21 - um so every day looks a little bit
04:23 - different depending on what types of
04:25 - projects are coming up as the most
04:27 - important for us to be working on this
04:29 - week um it's often kind of hard to tell
04:31 - what's going on
04:32 - next week or what i did last week um
04:35 - but recently you know i work quite a bit
04:37 - with our research group that
04:39 - uses cloud technology in order to scale
04:41 - out the different types of modeling that
04:44 - they do
04:45 - and which ties in well with what i did
04:46 - before i worked here so before that i
04:48 - was at google which emily had mentioned
04:50 - i'm working in their cloud cloud
04:53 - business as well
04:54 - i think for for my icebreaker when i was
04:56 - at google my manager at one point had
04:58 - told me and it really stuck with me in
05:00 - my head
05:01 - um was that every company will take as
05:04 - much as i can from you
05:05 - and it was an interesting comment to
05:07 - hear from a manager who would be in that
05:09 - position to
05:10 - benefit from me providing you know as
05:12 - much as i possibly could in that
05:14 - position
05:15 - i'm but i think it's a good a good thing
05:17 - to keep in mind because it's really up
05:19 - to you to set your own
05:20 - boundaries um and if you don't you know
05:23 - and if you continue working until 1am or
05:25 - whatnot the company will be more than
05:26 - happy to allow you to do that
05:28 - so it's just kind of a good piece of
05:30 - advice that i try to remind myself of
05:32 - occasionally
05:33 - i love that boundary setting starting us
05:35 - off strong
05:36 - deanna thank you for introducing
05:38 - yourself and thank you for being here um
05:39 - let's move on to issy would you mind
05:41 - introducing yourself and sharing some of
05:43 - your
05:44 - uh best advice you've received from a
05:45 - manager or mentor
05:47 - okay hello everyone i'm so excited to be
05:50 - here
05:50 - excited to meet all of you i'm dr ece
05:54 - um currently working at accenture
05:57 - as an aws cloud solutions architect
06:01 - and my day-to-day is
06:04 - kind of similar um for a few months so
06:08 - like two
06:08 - three months i'm in one project it's
06:10 - kind of the same thing
06:11 - and then another three months is
06:13 - different um but what i really
06:16 - what i'm doing currently i'm building a
06:18 - vaccine
06:19 - management platform so all of you will
06:22 - be taking the vaccine in a few months of
06:24 - those we've taken
06:26 - uh we're building that platform on an
06:29 - aws
06:30 - cloud infrastructure so i'm really
06:32 - excited i'm
06:33 - able to do such great work
06:37 - that impacts all of us um and one great
06:40 - advice that i've received
06:42 - once i made a mistake i was doing
06:43 - something and there was an error and
06:45 - then
06:45 - i kept going over it playing over it
06:47 - over in my mind and over and over
06:49 - and my manager called me and said you
06:51 - need to stop
06:52 - it's happened it's in the past just move
06:55 - on
06:56 - so yes that's my advice that is such
06:59 - good advice
06:59 - for life and for work
07:02 - and our final panel is jessica would you
07:04 - introduce yourself and share some advice
07:07 - hi i'm jessica pruitt i work as an azure
07:10 - cloud architect i
07:11 - primarily focus on infrastructure
07:13 - architecture so i
07:16 - working for deloitte i support internal
07:18 - teams that develop applications there's
07:20 - application architects that
07:22 - work with that you know designing the
07:26 - front end of the application i worry
07:28 - about the non-functional requirements
07:30 - you know
07:31 - high availability disaster recovery
07:33 - performance
07:36 - you know trying to make sure that the
07:38 - application
07:39 - is uh is ready to do what the
07:42 - application architects needed to do
07:46 - so my day is very busy
07:49 - i also have a hard time figuring out
07:51 - what i did yesterday and
07:53 - what i do every day is putting out a lot
07:55 - of fires
07:56 - i'm good with notes i take a lot of
07:58 - screenshots
07:59 - um it's very important to be organized
08:02 - because uh there's a lot of information
08:04 - flying back and forth people information
08:07 - everywhere so uh that's that's a
08:10 - uh a secret weapon is getting really
08:12 - organized with
08:13 - the information that you have to manage
08:15 - when you're in technology just for
08:17 - yourself
08:18 - um one of the best uh
08:22 - some of the best advice that i've been
08:24 - given is to be a sponge
08:26 - um if to be successful in life and
08:29 - especially in technology
08:31 - you need to be a lifelong learner so
08:33 - having constant
08:34 - interest in new things and and figuring
08:37 - out
08:37 - what your next next thing is to learn is
08:40 - is really important
08:42 - and sometimes you just don't have all
08:43 - the answers so being a sponge allows you
08:46 - to absorb
08:48 - a lot of the the unknown
08:51 - in a new topic and then eventually
08:54 - answers start to come together so
08:56 - being a sponge is like a really
08:57 - important thing sometimes as you're
08:59 - as you're adventuring through technology
09:01 - i love that because
09:02 - i think when you're new to the industry
09:04 - you think that you learn one technology
09:06 - you become an expert and you never have
09:07 - to learn anything new again
09:09 - and unfortunately technology moves in
09:11 - all directions all the time and you're
09:13 - always learning new things
09:14 - even experts as we have here today
09:17 - absolutely thanks brittany we like this
09:20 - advice as well um uh
09:22 - for mine i mentioned i'm emily i work at
09:24 - girls who code i'm the director of
09:25 - alumni programs
09:26 - um the best advice i've received that i
09:28 - used in every job is to write a thank
09:30 - you note
09:31 - write a thank you note when somebody
09:32 - gives you good advice write a thank you
09:34 - know when someone helps you on a project
09:36 - write a thank you know when you attend
09:38 - an event with a bunch of experts and
09:40 - they give you something to think about
09:42 - so this is my advice to all of you
09:44 - i'm sure these three amazing women are
09:46 - on linkedin and if you go find them
09:47 - later and send them a thank you note
09:49 - tomorrow
09:49 - they will remember you so that's my
09:51 - advice
09:53 - i'd like to talk about cloud computing
09:55 - 101 which is what we named this session
09:57 - because
09:58 - i think it means lots of things to lots
09:59 - of people i think it's
10:01 - trendy and you see it in articles and
10:03 - job descriptions and linkedin posts
10:05 - um so what i'm going to ask is that each
10:07 - of you sort of in a short
10:10 - layman's terms way if you were talking
10:12 - to someone who's never heard of cloud
10:13 - computing before
10:14 - what does this mean and ec could we
10:17 - start with you here
10:18 - yeah good question so i would say cloud
10:21 - computing
10:22 - is here is
10:26 - my database here is my application
10:28 - here's my stuff
10:30 - hold it for me
10:34 - just hold it for me and and um
10:37 - money you know just manage it for me and
10:40 - while i just
10:41 - focus on my core business that's what
10:43 - cloud computing is so we have different
10:44 - cloud providers
10:46 - like we've heard from the panelists we
10:47 - have microsoft we have google we have
10:50 - amazon and a few other cloud providers
10:53 - those are the people who are holding
10:54 - your stuff i love that and for
10:58 - the attendees you missed before the
11:00 - event we were
11:01 - setting up with the panelists and there
11:02 - was almost a fight here
11:04 - over what is the best cloud club
11:07 - all three and this is really cool for
11:08 - you all to know all three of these folks
11:10 - work for different
11:11 - providers there's not a single one they
11:13 - may argue what you think is the best
11:15 - um but there's lots of ways to go here
11:18 - um deanna can you add anything to that
11:19 - sort of what is cloud computing
11:21 - in simple terms yeah i'm gonna take a
11:23 - little bit of a different approach so
11:25 - emily had mentioned that i like baking
11:27 - um cloud computing to me is like
11:29 - they're different levels so you can
11:31 - imagine ordering a pizza
11:33 - you just call up you know domino's or
11:35 - wherever you're going to get a pizza
11:36 - from and the pizza shows up
11:38 - that's like what we would call probably
11:40 - platform as a service where it's super
11:41 - easy and very plug and play you can say
11:43 - like i want pepperoni or actually i want
11:45 - mushrooms
11:46 - and everything's great or you can
11:48 - continue to kind of dive a little bit
11:50 - deeper and
11:51 - control more of your pizza so to say
11:54 - so you could go to trader joe's and pick
11:56 - up their pizza dough i've heard it's
11:58 - pretty good
11:59 - and then you can buy some tomato sauce
12:01 - and put some cheddar cheese on top
12:04 - or you can go all the way down to the
12:06 - bottom and mill your own grains and then
12:08 - make your own flour and make your own
12:10 - dough and then have this whole you know
12:12 - 25 hour pizza making experience
12:15 - which is getting much much closer to a
12:17 - traditional
12:18 - infrastructure setup and a little bit
12:20 - more away from the idea of leveraging
12:22 - somewhere
12:22 - someone else's expertise to make your
12:25 - pizza or hold your stuff or however you
12:27 - want to
12:28 - to phrase it there awesome i like it and
12:31 - now i'm hungry we did this before dinner
12:33 - so thank you for that
12:34 - jessica do you have another analogy or
12:36 - another way of thinking about it or
12:37 - describing it
12:38 - uh sure well i mean at the end of the
12:41 - day
12:42 - it's uh using somebody else's hardware
12:45 - and software
12:46 - so um the the pizza is
12:50 - a great analogy and and izzy says other
12:52 - people's stuff
12:53 - um the benefit is when
12:56 - in the traditional on-premise sense
12:59 - before the cloud was around
13:00 - companies had to invest a lot of money
13:03 - in those servers and infrastructure and
13:05 - have people
13:06 - to manage it and so you before you even
13:09 - get into
13:09 - coding and development you're spending
13:12 - all this time just trying to buy things
13:14 - and
13:14 - and set things up and so and then you
13:17 - have
13:17 - a lot of expense around that so the
13:19 - cloud kind of flipped the coin
13:22 - for um being able to innovate quicker
13:25 - because uh other people have done all
13:28 - that leg work
13:28 - and and you can plug in uh like like
13:31 - deanna said you can get to that
13:33 - fully prepared pizza if you want
13:37 - or you may want to customize it and just
13:39 - you know order the dough
13:40 - and figure out what goes on top or you
13:42 - may want to start from scratch and say
13:44 - just give me all the ingredients you
13:46 - know so
13:47 - it's it's a really wonderful way for
13:50 - people to
13:52 - get right into the business of
13:53 - developing instead of just uh
13:55 - instead of having to be in the business
13:57 - of buying
13:58 - still spending money but it's a it's a
14:01 - quicker way to get there
14:03 - i love this that's sort of three
14:04 - different ways of thinking about this
14:06 - and i hope that
14:07 - one of those at least clicked with all
14:08 - of you listening in um
14:10 - certainly helped me understand that this
14:12 - is something that's kind of new to me as
14:13 - well
14:14 - um so there's a lot of different ways to
14:16 - go into computer science to go into
14:17 - software to go into tech
14:19 - somehow all three of you have ended up
14:21 - in this expertise area that's why we
14:23 - asked you to join us on this panel
14:24 - um i would love to understand a little
14:26 - bit about that journey like what did you
14:28 - start
14:28 - studying what did you do at the
14:30 - beginning of your career and really what
14:31 - drew you into this field
14:33 - as a place to specialize over time um
14:36 - deanna i'm gonna kick it back to you to
14:37 - start this one off
14:42 - oh you're muted deanna oh man
14:46 - i know how to work zoom i'm not going to
14:47 - turn into a cat for everyone who
14:49 - saw the wonderful meme earlier i'm yeah
14:53 - when i went to college
14:54 - i really the main goal was to graduate
14:56 - and get a job
14:58 - and then looking at kind of the job
14:59 - market at the time and where things were
15:01 - trending computer science looked like a
15:03 - very
15:04 - you know realistic degree to to study
15:06 - and to get a job after school
15:08 - i'm my mom also is a computer scientist
15:11 - and so i thought
15:12 - if anything i could take a class and if
15:14 - i didn't like it we would have something
15:15 - to talk about
15:16 - and maybe i would understand her job a
15:18 - little bit better i'm
15:20 - but we're very similar and so i was not
15:23 - very surprising to me that i actually
15:24 - ended up
15:24 - loving it um so after i graduated i
15:27 - worked at ibm for a little bit and just
15:29 - kind of
15:30 - through the way that big companies work
15:32 - found myself eventually on a cloud team
15:34 - um and so it wasn't so much by my own
15:37 - seeking out that it happened but as soon
15:40 - as i landed there i really started to
15:42 - thrive and found it to be a fun and
15:44 - exciting environment i think partially
15:46 - jessica you had mentioned this before of
15:48 - like you end up being able to see so
15:50 - much more innovation happening in the
15:52 - cloud because so much of
15:54 - what takes a very long time is provided
15:56 - um
15:57 - that it was a really fast paced and fun
15:59 - environment to work in within a company
16:01 - um so once i found that then i just kind
16:03 - of stuck in that stream for
16:05 - for quite a while i love that and i
16:07 - think it's a realistic way that
16:08 - sometimes you fall into
16:10 - a career path um or big companies
16:12 - shuffle you around or you start in a
16:14 - rotational program or an apprenticeship
16:16 - and all of a sudden
16:17 - you have so much experience in one area
16:18 - that fingers crossed you like it because
16:20 - now you're an expert
16:22 - exactly um jessica tell us a little bit
16:25 - about your path here
16:27 - sure mine wasn't a traditional one so i
16:30 - i went to the school of hard knocks
16:32 - before i actually finished my college
16:33 - degree
16:34 - i grew up pretty poor my mom was a
16:37 - waitress and
16:38 - while i was in high school she was going
16:41 - to college and she was working on her
16:43 - engineering degree
16:44 - and it was environmental engineering
16:47 - so she was taking classes in concrete
16:50 - and
16:50 - i'm looking at that going yeah i'm not
16:52 - going to be an engineer i'm not
16:54 - interested in concrete
16:55 - but you know she she got me a job
16:59 - as a secretary in an environmental firm
17:02 - right out of college and
17:03 - i was good at organizing things so i i
17:06 - had a couple of jobs as
17:07 - a an office person and then i lived
17:10 - briefly out in colorado i came back to
17:12 - tampa and i ended up as a temporary
17:14 - employee for a major bank
17:16 - and this is an interesting story the um
17:19 - i was working on spreadsheets and there
17:21 - was a major problem with their write-off
17:23 - process their you know their end-of-year
17:25 - stuff and they had hired a female
17:29 - executive to come in had a lot of
17:31 - programming experience a master's degree
17:33 - in finance and
17:36 - because of politics and stuff the people
17:39 - that were there didn't want her
17:40 - advice so she was bored and i sat next
17:42 - to her
17:43 - so i got full-time
17:47 - mentorship from this fabulously
17:49 - brilliant female who
17:51 - taught me all about databases talked to
17:53 - me about finance helped me figure out
17:55 - these spreadsheets
17:56 - so i basically threw her i was remote
17:59 - hands for her brain
18:00 - we developed a database and um
18:04 - my boss got promoted uh i trained people
18:07 - in new york everything was cool but they
18:08 - wouldn't hire me because i didn't have a
18:10 - degree
18:10 - i went from seven dollars an hour to ten
18:12 - dollars an hour awesome
18:14 - um they asked what they could do for me
18:16 - and i said can you send me to a database
18:18 - class a real class because i'd like an
18:20 - education
18:22 - so um i went to a computer training
18:25 - school and while i was there i thought
18:27 - you know if i teach this stuff i could
18:29 - probably learn it
18:30 - so i said how do you become a teacher
18:31 - because they were my age and
18:33 - um i went on to teach like 40 computer
18:35 - classes worked for them for five years
18:37 - had some kids
18:39 - uh started my own business and
18:42 - you know uh over the years worked for
18:45 - the dod lived in germany for a little
18:46 - while
18:47 - and then ended up back here in tampa and
18:50 - worked for the big four
18:52 - and uh i've learned to kind of chase the
18:56 - money
18:56 - over the years like i have to spend a
18:58 - lot of time learning
19:00 - and so i i make my career moves and i
19:03 - figure out what i'm going to do next
19:05 - by trying to kind of research where
19:08 - technology is going
19:10 - and what i'm interested in and i have
19:13 - kind of evolved that and then i also
19:15 - wasn't getting the jobs i wanted to
19:17 - without the degree the piece of paper so
19:19 - i did school remotely
19:20 - i finished my master's after the fact i
19:23 - ended up teaching some of the courses
19:25 - which was kind of fun
19:26 - um i had to pay for it but i taught them
19:29 - and so uh yeah here i am
19:32 - it's it's a weird path that i got here
19:35 - and it's pretty amazing that i'm i'm
19:37 - getting to do what i am today i really
19:39 - love my job and
19:40 - i love working with deloitte they uh
19:43 - they have you bring your genuine self
19:45 - and they really want you to be
19:47 - um your best and and there's a lot of
19:50 - opportunity so it's so i i
19:52 - feel really blessed i love that story
19:54 - jessica thank you so much for sharing
19:56 - that
19:56 - um i think it's a good illustration too
19:58 - that just because you start doing one
19:59 - thing doesn't mean that that's what you
20:00 - do forever careers are long
20:02 - and there's a lot of opportunity out
20:04 - there um let's hear a little bit from ec
20:07 - and um alyssa my colleague is going to
20:09 - drop a link in the chat here
20:11 - if you are wanting to hear more from e.c
20:13 - she has written a book about her story
20:15 - so we wanted to link to her book as well
20:16 - but let's hear directly from you
20:18 - yeah i mean jessica that was so
20:20 - inspiring thank you for sharing that
20:23 - wow awesome okay so my
20:26 - my story is a little um similar to
20:28 - jessica's because
20:29 - i've always been deliberate about
20:32 - chasing the money
20:34 - and um i started off i went to
20:37 - college i studied computer engineering i
20:40 - studied computer engineering in nigeria
20:43 - where girls weren't even allowed to go
20:46 - to school uh
20:48 - to go to college you just finish your
20:50 - high school
20:51 - and then you're married off but i
20:53 - decided to be different i went to
20:55 - college
20:56 - there was just one computer for 150 of
20:59 - us to share
21:00 - like we would form what would stay in
21:02 - the line until it gets to your turn when
21:04 - it gets your turn you just have five
21:05 - minutes
21:06 - to write your code execute your code and
21:09 - get out of there
21:10 - so that was how i learned um how to code
21:13 - well in the midst of all of those
21:14 - challenges i knew i wanted to be where i
21:17 - am today
21:18 - so i kept the focus by the time i
21:20 - graduated from college i was already an
21:23 - oracle certified professional
21:24 - and that's because i was taking external
21:27 - classes
21:28 - out of school i found this place where
21:30 - there were some indians who were
21:32 - doing computer classes and trainings so
21:34 - i was going there
21:35 - after school in the evenings i was
21:37 - taking oracle
21:38 - classes and then at the end but by five
21:41 - years when i finished
21:42 - my bachelor's i already had four oracle
21:45 - certifications so i got out of college
21:47 - and then immediately i was working as an
21:49 - oracle dba and i did that for a while
21:52 - you know working on databases and things
21:54 - like that and then
21:55 - i now started hearing a lot about okay i
21:57 - moved to the u.s when i moved to the u.s
22:00 - by the time i moved to the u.s i already
22:01 - had a phd in technology
22:03 - um so i did my master's information
22:05 - technology i did a phd in technology
22:07 - management all of that just chasing the
22:09 - money and then when i came here
22:12 - and then i heard everyone's talking
22:13 - about cloud cloud cloud i'm like what
22:15 - the heck is this cloud
22:16 - i did some research i found out i saw
22:18 - the trajectory i saw that
22:19 - that's where the money is i sat down i
22:22 - prepared for
22:23 - um certifications i i focused on aws
22:26 - got aws certified i taught myself aws
22:29 - in my room read it passed got certified
22:33 - and i started working at accenture so
22:35 - that's my story
22:36 - i i love it first i just love the candor
22:40 - around chasing the money
22:41 - it's not a bad thing to talk about money
22:43 - it's not a bad thing to talk about
22:45 - advocating for yourself looking for the
22:46 - next opportunity this is so important
22:48 - and it's so great to hear you all talk
22:50 - about that i want to do a brief
22:51 - digression
22:52 - um first thing alyssa we're going to do
22:53 - a quick poll so this is for you
22:55 - attendees i would love to know a little
22:57 - bit about how much
22:58 - you know about cloud so we're going to
22:59 - have a poll pop up on your screen
23:02 - attend a panelist if you see it you can
23:04 - answer it and then it'll go away
23:06 - but this is really helpful to us as we
23:08 - think about our programs
23:10 - um and yeah i know they are awesome
23:12 - folks in the comments are talking about
23:14 - how awesome you are and it's true you
23:15 - all are so awesome
23:17 - so um i'm gonna digress from our our
23:19 - scripted questions for a second because
23:20 - there's something i've heard a bunch of
23:22 - you say which is around certifications
23:24 - and i would love to understand you know
23:26 - there's degrees like a bachelor's degree
23:28 - a master's degree phd
23:29 - could maybe uh ec if you could just
23:32 - share a little bit about like what is a
23:33 - certification and how does that fit into
23:35 - this world of cloud computing absolutely
23:38 - so in the tech world
23:40 - we love certifications um certification
23:43 - is
23:44 - just that validation that you have
23:47 - the skill sets that you say you have you
23:50 - know and you cannot have
23:52 - too many certifications i probably have
23:54 - somewhere around 12 or 13 certifications
23:56 - because i don't joke like i i don't
24:00 - drink at all
24:01 - so the industry recognizes you if you
24:04 - say you're an oracle certified
24:05 - professional it means you have the skill
24:07 - set
24:07 - you're a google certified professional
24:09 - amazon web service
24:11 - professional as your microsoft azure
24:13 - certified professional
24:15 - so i'll encourage everyone if you're in
24:17 - college out of college
24:19 - get certified there's so many in my book
24:21 - i listed all the certifications
24:23 - and kind of give some guidance on based
24:25 - on your skill sets and what you love to
24:27 - do
24:27 - but just get certified thank you
24:31 - um deanna or jessica do you want to add
24:32 - anything about certifications in your
24:34 - experience
24:35 - i think especially like when you're
24:37 - coming out of school without the
24:39 - industry experience it's a very helpful
24:40 - way for you to benchmark with what the
24:42 - industry knows
24:43 - so they might not you know i went to a
24:45 - very small college they were most
24:47 - companies were not familiar with my
24:49 - curriculum but they then could look at
24:51 - things that i had been certified in as
24:53 - well and understand okay we know what
24:55 - you know what that network certification
24:57 - is for example so
24:58 - she must understand this when we can
25:00 - hire her or expect her to know that
25:03 - okay so real granular if i wanted to get
25:05 - a certification
25:06 - like what website do i go to what do i
25:09 - look up on the internet
25:10 - let me google it for you
25:14 - really i mean it's it's it's pretty easy
25:16 - you can search for any of these things
25:17 - you can search aws certification
25:19 - and they'll be multiple different kinds
25:22 - i i know that google one's a little bit
25:23 - better but there's usually like an
25:25 - intro or an associate kind of
25:28 - application developer type intro level
25:31 - and then after that you'll find
25:32 - more advanced ones in certain areas and
25:34 - that's partially just because cloud
25:35 - technology is so broad
25:37 - so then there'll be one in like
25:39 - networking specific technology there'll
25:41 - be one in databases one in
25:43 - analytics and things like that so that
25:45 - you can then
25:46 - you know select certain areas that
25:48 - you're more interested in
25:50 - um from my point of view i think like
25:51 - the the baseline ones that cover across
25:54 - all of the different types of technology
25:55 - is a good way to start
25:57 - and then as you find areas that you're
25:58 - interested in then diving in more there
26:00 - is probably a good approach
26:02 - awesome jessica you want to add anything
26:06 - uh yeah i the one thing about
26:08 - certifications is
26:09 - there's a lot of people looking to take
26:10 - your money for certifications
26:12 - and and one of the ways for you to think
26:15 - about certifications and your education
26:17 - frankly
26:18 - is your time is money and
26:21 - the investment you make in your
26:23 - certifications should
26:24 - give you a reward how do you figure that
26:27 - out
26:28 - if you go if linkedin is a gold mine
26:31 - when you're trying to figure out
26:32 - careers i recommend that you go to
26:35 - linkedin it's a it's a kind of a
26:37 - facebook for job searching and looking
26:40 - at companies
26:41 - and take a look at careers that you
26:43 - think you're interested in or maybe
26:45 - you're starting out in and look at
26:47 - jobs and people that are successful in
26:49 - the job that that are doing things that
26:50 - you think you might want to do
26:52 - look at their certifications and and
26:55 - then also
26:56 - search jobs in linkedin for example that
26:58 - are looking for people
27:00 - the job search engines actually key on
27:03 - your certifications
27:04 - so you can follow the money
27:08 - and you can invest in yourself in a way
27:11 - that um
27:13 - you know you're spending your money on
27:14 - the right things um you know when when i
27:16 - wasn't making a lot of money i
27:18 - i took some very hard tests that were
27:20 - very expensive they cost 500
27:22 - to take they take months to study for
27:25 - and
27:26 - i'm not a good test taker i you know and
27:29 - so you have to be willing to pay twice
27:32 - sometimes for these tests and so
27:35 - you really want to be committed to the
27:36 - goal and make sure that the bang is
27:38 - worth the buck
27:39 - so yeah could i just add to what jessica
27:42 - said
27:43 - if you take the exam the first time and
27:46 - you feel it
27:47 - take it again i like that
27:50 - another thing another thing to note once
27:52 - you get your first job a lot of
27:54 - companies have professional development
27:56 - budgets
27:56 - so you know it's not a guarantee but you
27:59 - might have 500 or a thousand dollars
28:01 - that you're allowed to spend on a
28:02 - training
28:02 - during the year um and this is the kind
28:04 - of thing that you could take to your
28:06 - manager and say i would like to do the
28:07 - certification
28:08 - you know can i use my professional
28:10 - development money for this
28:12 - um because jessica's right it's
28:14 - expensive the other thing i want to add
28:16 - is when
28:17 - when i was making seven bucks an hour
28:19 - and i didn't have an education and i
28:20 - just
28:20 - needed a better job i had kids to feed i
28:24 - um linkedin does this too you can do
28:26 - certifications that are like these
28:27 - little badges
28:28 - they're not necessarily recognized by
28:30 - the industry but if you can get an
28:32 - interview
28:33 - you can say look i can't afford the
28:34 - certifications
28:36 - but i wanted to prove that i can do
28:39 - these certifications so these are
28:41 - examples i know they're not
28:42 - you know the the expensive ones but i
28:44 - want you to know that i'm
28:46 - capable of doing this
28:49 - good points yeah that's a great feature
28:51 - i love that linkedin learning is another
28:53 - improving
28:54 - yeah yeah you're proving yourself you've
28:57 - got to show some badges of proof
28:59 - and you do it within your means whatever
29:00 - they are absolutely
29:02 - causera also has some um free courses
29:05 - that you can take and they give you a
29:07 - coursera certificate you know
29:09 - well it's free and just just like
29:11 - jessica said you're showing
29:13 - that you have the skill sets yeah that's
29:15 - a good point
29:16 - so we did that poll about how
29:18 - comfortable people feel on a scale of
29:19 - one to ten
29:20 - with cloud computing like how
29:22 - knowledgeable they are and uh about
29:24 - 70 percent said only a one two or three
29:27 - and i'm saying that because i want you
29:28 - all to know that you're in the same boat
29:30 - here like nobody is an expert except the
29:32 - three women on the screen
29:33 - everybody there's no question that's too
29:35 - silly like everybody is learning about
29:37 - this
29:38 - the vast majority of you feel really new
29:40 - to this kind of content
29:42 - people have been posting some awesome
29:43 - links including ec thank you for that
29:45 - so uh grab those links and make sure you
29:47 - save those let's move on to another
29:48 - question
29:49 - um some of you alluded to this a little
29:51 - bit um jessica i'd like to start with
29:53 - you here
29:54 - so the question we got this a lot in our
29:56 - registration which is
29:57 - how do you anticipate cloud computing
29:59 - changing over time
30:00 - what trends have you noticed what do you
30:02 - think is on the horizon
30:04 - you mentioned like looking ahead like
30:06 - what if we're looking ahead what are we
30:07 - looking at
30:09 - uh well i you know i i thought this was
30:11 - an interesting question and i don't have
30:13 - a crystal ball
30:14 - so i i don't know what lies ahead but i
30:17 - think it's a pretty safe bet to say that
30:19 - you know ai um
30:22 - and uh you know quantum computing and
30:25 - and
30:25 - you know some of the some of these big
30:27 - buzzwords are the way of the future the
30:29 - reason
30:30 - their buzzwords what they're the way of
30:31 - the future is is the nut hasn't been
30:33 - cracked yet
30:34 - i mean ai uh there's a lot of fear about
30:37 - you know
30:37 - ai taking over jobs and things like that
30:41 - yes ai has a lot of potential it's not
30:43 - there yet
30:44 - but people are thinking that way so um
30:47 - i do think that you know a lot of people
30:49 - are excited about
30:50 - a lot of these new new areas and so
30:54 - the excitement the momentum and the
30:56 - possibilities
30:57 - usually lead to the innovation and the
31:00 - growth in that area
31:01 - um how cloud computing will change i
31:04 - think things are going to be more
31:05 - accessible i noticed that
31:07 - more layers keep getting added to make
31:10 - things easier for people so
31:12 - you know i mentioned i'm an
31:13 - infrastructure person so
31:15 - you know you start at the lower levels
31:16 - of ones and zeros and you plug things in
31:18 - and then you put software on top of
31:20 - things to make things easier
31:22 - and and with cloud computing there's a
31:24 - lot of layers on top of things
31:26 - when you get out here to a presentation
31:30 - you don't have to know all these things
31:32 - under the hood you don't have to know
31:34 - how your car runs or how to change your
31:36 - oil
31:36 - you just have to know how to use the
31:38 - things inside here
31:40 - um so
31:43 - so being a scientist for ai
31:46 - requires a lot of education and you know
31:49 - a lot of
31:50 - work there but they're starting to
31:52 - extrapolate those
31:54 - layers and and there's some software
31:56 - available now to
31:58 - where you can kind of do learning simply
32:02 - without having to be that you know super
32:04 - computer up here yourself you know they
32:06 - they're they're putting those layers in
32:07 - place
32:08 - so that it doesn't have to be that hard
32:10 - so i think that's going to continue to
32:12 - happen the challenge with that is that
32:14 - the more layers you put on things
32:16 - the more things can go wrong so
32:19 - something
32:19 - down here can fall out and cause
32:21 - problems up here
32:23 - and so there's a lot of busy work and
32:25 - there's a lot of opportunity
32:27 - so every time another layer occurs
32:28 - there's all these specializations and
32:31 - all this work and stuff that has to
32:33 - happen to make it happen
32:34 - so there's opportunity all over the
32:36 - place it's really what you what are you
32:37 - interested in
32:38 - thanks jessica issy do you want to add
32:41 - your predictions for what's coming down
32:43 - the pike
32:43 - yeah i was reading a forbes article i
32:46 - think last week
32:47 - and it says that we're just around 20
32:52 - of cloud penetration so it means that
32:55 - there's still a whole lot
32:57 - of work to do um a lot of enterprises
33:01 - especially with covid what we've seen
33:04 - in the last one year people don't want
33:06 - to be around
33:07 - six feet of each other so that means
33:10 - that people do
33:11 - not want to be on premises
33:14 - like they don't want to be in a physical
33:16 - location
33:18 - working on servers and doing all of that
33:20 - what we used to do in the past
33:22 - people want to be a part so being a part
33:25 - means you want to go to the cloud so
33:26 - we've seen in the last one year
33:29 - a lot of rush you know
33:32 - we're doing quite a lot of migration you
33:35 - know public sector is moving to the
33:37 - cloud
33:38 - you know financial services healthcare
33:41 - agreed
33:42 - everybody's moving to the cloud and so
33:44 - the cloud is here to stay
33:46 - and i believe that just like jessica
33:49 - mentioned about ai
33:50 - and all of this fancy stuff will
33:54 - ride on top of cloud you know so
33:57 - i'm doing my second masters in in
34:00 - artificial intelligence
34:01 - it's just because
34:04 - i think the idea of not you know always
34:07 - wanting to learn
34:08 - um i i just want to learn i want to
34:10 - follow the trend
34:12 - i want to follow the money uh and that's
34:15 - you know
34:16 - that's what that's what i would say so
34:17 - between ai we're right on top of cloud
34:20 - but there's still a lot of penetration
34:22 - to do within cloud
34:24 - i love that and i love the second
34:26 - masters we do get a question in the chat
34:28 - here about
34:29 - uh do you need a master's degree and
34:31 - izzy said no and deanna pointed out she
34:32 - doesn't have a master's degree
34:34 - there's a lot of ways to grow in a field
34:36 - that is as new and vibrant as this
34:39 - um so deanna what do you think is on the
34:41 - horizon
34:42 - it's a little bit different now that i'm
34:43 - not in cloud technology
34:45 - um i don't you know i don't read all
34:47 - these articles all the time anymore and
34:48 - i'm not
34:49 - trying to sell cloud to financial
34:51 - services customers and so
34:52 - being on the other side and actually
34:54 - working at one of these companies
34:56 - i'm it's much more i don't know i feel
34:58 - like we're
34:59 - so much further behind that to me like
35:03 - the biggest hurdle to get things to the
35:05 - cloud is always the security
35:06 - conversation
35:07 - it's never an easy thing to say like oh
35:10 - is my data actually safe up there
35:12 - i'm or where is it right like what
35:15 - happens if it's deleted
35:16 - nobody wants to look at it logically and
35:19 - understand that your data is probably
35:20 - much much safer in the cloud than it is
35:22 - in any on-prem data center that
35:24 - is resting away in some facility that
35:26 - that who knows
35:27 - has access to with their badge and
35:29 - whatnot i'm
35:31 - but it's more of a logical and a
35:34 - an emotional argument and i think the
35:36 - security technology that's out there
35:38 - today to a certain degree is is
35:40 - difficult to understand for a lot of
35:42 - people and so i think that that will
35:43 - continue to evolve and become
35:45 - i think jessica to your point like
35:47 - easier and easier over time
35:49 - so that it doesn't even become a
35:51 - conversation that's happening that much
35:52 - anymore and that people just default
35:54 - feel comfortable
35:56 - with moving stuff to the cloud um that's
35:59 - one where i think like and maybe not so
36:01 - much on the big time horizon of like
36:03 - you know 10 years from now when
36:04 - everything's super cool we have
36:05 - artificial intelligence and everything
36:07 - but more of like
36:08 - three years from now and a little bit
36:11 - smaller and then the other thing that we
36:12 - always get tripped up on
36:14 - is billing um the cloud is really
36:16 - complicated to understand
36:18 - with billing the typical um
36:22 - you know enterprise big company is very
36:24 - familiar with writing a big check
36:26 - to some kind of vendor for a ton of
36:28 - hardware that's going to be delivered
36:30 - and then they'll set it up and they can
36:31 - physically see it and understand it and
36:34 - track it in accounting
36:35 - it's very difficult for a company to
36:37 - understand
36:38 - that my costs are going to vary every
36:40 - month that i can't predict them
36:42 - and that i don't know what services
36:43 - we're going to use or how the different
36:45 - each surface service has like 100
36:47 - different skus attached to it for
36:50 - every reason you skew i actually don't
36:53 - know what that stands for sku
36:55 - uh it's going to be it's a number to
36:57 - identify the item
36:59 - i was trying to think of the actual
37:00 - acronym there i'm so if you think of
37:03 - like
37:05 - yeah i won't think of a better example
37:08 - than that
37:08 - it's a sister google will know all of
37:11 - the different ways that we get charged
37:13 - um it's very hard to read those bills
37:15 - and understand
37:16 - exactly where our money went um
37:19 - and so that's that's kind of the second
37:21 - hurdle of being on the other side of a
37:23 - cloud relationship now and trying to
37:25 - figure out
37:25 - so that we can become comfortable with
37:27 - moving more things to the cloud by
37:29 - anticipating what it might cost
37:31 - um and being able to define that i mean
37:33 - i struggle sometimes to
37:35 - read my phone bill and understand why it
37:37 - has changed right and that's like a
37:38 - similar on a much smaller scale like
37:40 - i used more data but like doing what and
37:43 - how and
37:44 - at what rates doing different things um
37:47 - i want to do our second poll because it
37:49 - pertains to our last group of questions
37:51 - here
37:51 - alyssa could you put our second poll and
37:53 - if all of our attendees
37:55 - um we want to know how you prefer to
37:57 - learn new technologies
37:58 - do you study solo do you study in small
38:01 - groups
38:02 - do you like a classroom or do you like
38:04 - to do online tutorials
38:06 - um so take a moment and when you are
38:07 - ready just answer that question
38:10 - and the reason we're asking you this is
38:12 - because i'm going to ask our experts
38:13 - here
38:14 - what advice they have for college
38:15 - students and young professionals who
38:16 - want to learn these skills like
38:18 - how do we do this do you we talked about
38:20 - some certifications
38:22 - but we've also received a question in
38:24 - the chat about what should high school
38:25 - students be studying
38:27 - what should college students be studying
38:29 - and then what else could folks do
38:31 - on the side um jessica maybe we can
38:33 - start with you on this one
38:36 - sure um so
38:41 - how to build your skills in cloud
38:43 - computing you know
38:44 - i would actually step back a little bit
38:46 - and start with
38:48 - building some critical thinking skills
38:50 - um
38:51 - you know learning how to solve a problem
38:55 - and break it down is going to be a
38:57 - really good
38:58 - baseline for learning how to work with
39:01 - computers
39:02 - and get into cloud computing you know
39:05 - when you're when you're
39:06 - programming regardless of what program
39:09 - it is you're basically giving
39:10 - instructions to a computer
39:12 - and um
39:16 - depending on the complexity of what you
39:18 - need to program
39:19 - you have to learn how to take something
39:21 - fuzzy and complicated and break it down
39:24 - into a series of steps and instructions
39:29 - there we go sorry sorry i was drinking
39:31 - water i moved my mic
39:33 - um so learning how to break things down
39:37 - into a series of steps and instructions
39:39 - and and the reason critical thinking is
39:41 - really important
39:42 - is because it's messy
39:46 - it's always messy you're always dealing
39:48 - with messy problems you have
39:50 - a mess and you have to learn how to do
39:52 - something with the mess and turn it into
39:54 - something that's not messy anymore so
39:57 - if you spend some time and there's
39:58 - critical thinking courses and
40:00 - and just some theory around how to
40:04 - break things and organize things you're
40:06 - learning it in your biology class you
40:07 - know you learn how to classify things
40:09 - for biology
40:11 - and and and put things into different um
40:15 - slots that's the same kind of concept of
40:17 - what you end up doing with computers and
40:19 - in solving problems
40:21 - when you want to get into programming
40:23 - don't
40:25 - start really itty bitty like if you can
40:27 - give an instruction
40:29 - and it does something back you have
40:31 - programmed
40:32 - you know you don't need to program a
40:35 - robot
40:36 - to talk back to you um start with
40:40 - you know hello world you can google
40:41 - hello world there is
40:43 - a lot of languages that you can learn
40:46 - hello world you're basically giving the
40:48 - computer an instruction
40:49 - to talk back to you and say hello world
40:52 - and you can do this in
40:53 - lots of link programming languages and
40:56 - just doing that one simple thing in a
40:58 - lot of different mediums
40:59 - would give you a sense of accomplishment
41:03 - but also kind of an understanding of
41:06 - it's really the same
41:08 - it's just different tools to talk
41:12 - to the computer and so your your job
41:16 - is really learning how to talk to the
41:18 - computer
41:19 - so it knows how to receive your words
41:22 - thank you jessica i love that someone
41:24 - once explained to me that just like if
41:25 - you're learning a new language like a
41:27 - spoken language you know you start and
41:30 - you you're not
41:30 - you're just trying to be understood
41:32 - right you're trying to order a glass of
41:34 - soda in another country in another
41:36 - language it doesn't have to be fancy
41:38 - you're just trying to get yourself
41:39 - understood and you get smoother and more
41:43 - dynamic as you go but you got to start
41:45 - somewhere
41:46 - and i think that's true when you're
41:47 - learning to talk to a computer as well
41:49 - um deanna what do you think advice for
41:51 - folks on
41:52 - what they should study how they can
41:54 - prepare for this career
41:56 - yeah um that's such a big question
42:00 - i break it down choose a part it's up to
42:03 - you
42:05 - yeah i do like um like jessica what you
42:07 - said about a feeling of accomplishment i
42:09 - think it's really important that
42:10 - you can find um coursera and udacity and
42:14 - all these like
42:14 - online courses to really zero in on a
42:17 - certain area and figure out like how do
42:19 - i code in python how do i code in java
42:22 - how do i code
42:23 - all these different languages i'm but
42:25 - taking a moment to actually like
42:27 - recognize that you did something and
42:29 - that you got the
42:30 - computer to talk back to you or you know
42:32 - you hit a bug
42:33 - and figured it out eventually and got
42:36 - your program to work the way that you
42:37 - wanted to
42:38 - i think is a really important part of it
42:40 - because
42:41 - otherwise it can feel like you're not
42:43 - actually
42:44 - really achieving you know you're you're
42:46 - not hitting the milestones or anything
42:48 - like that i think if you take a moment
42:50 - to say
42:50 - i did right i programmed something and i
42:53 - can continue
42:54 - doing this you'll want to it's positive
42:56 - reinforcement within your own
42:58 - your own brain which will only help you
43:00 - thank you
43:01 - you see how about you
43:05 - i think i would say all right go to
43:08 - udemy
43:09 - casera linkedin and just start with the
43:12 - basics
43:14 - search for cloud foundation search for
43:17 - cloud
43:17 - computing 101 and and start there
43:21 - um learn learn learn and learn take
43:23 - notes
43:24 - so i still write like i still have a
43:27 - book on the pen
43:28 - i still write i know we're in technology
43:30 - age
43:33 - but yeah i see that yeah
43:36 - look at all three of you are not
43:42 - so that you can go back to it and when
43:45 - someone put in the chat that
43:46 - how do you struggle with self-paced
43:49 - learning
43:50 - yeah i know that it can be a challenge
43:52 - but
43:53 - you really for you to survive in tech
43:56 - you have to be self-motivated you have
44:00 - to
44:00 - you know and i think the other speakers
44:02 - have spoken about
44:03 - self reinforcement or appreciation
44:06 - so when you do a little bit if you
44:08 - finish one chapter
44:09 - you appreciate yourself uh if you can
44:12 - form groups two or three people
44:14 - come together let's finish this course
44:17 - in one month
44:18 - and just keep pushing yourself always
44:20 - remember to
44:23 - to push yourself uh if people come from
44:26 - situations where um there was one
44:29 - computer for 150 people to share and now
44:32 - i've taught over a thousand girls how to
44:34 - code in the last one year
44:36 - it was all that self motivation and self
44:38 - push
44:39 - so push yourself learn little bits
44:42 - appreciate yourself
44:43 - and keep on going thank you i think the
44:46 - account
44:47 - oh go ahead jessica oh i was just going
44:51 - to add that
44:52 - you know the other the other thing about
44:54 - you know giving yourself positive
44:56 - rewards and learning how to push past
44:58 - goals is it it translates everywhere in
45:00 - your life
45:01 - a funny little story i i have a farm now
45:03 - and i have
45:04 - some donkeys and a horse and it's
45:06 - expensive to get their hooves done
45:08 - and my daughter is the horse person but
45:10 - now i'm taking care of them because
45:11 - she's in college
45:12 - and i don't want to spend 200 a month to
45:15 - take care of hooves
45:16 - i taught myself i'm like you know if i
45:17 - can teach myself how to do computers i
45:19 - can figure out how to clip these hooves
45:21 - my daughter was really upset and then
45:23 - finally i took enough courses
45:26 - on how to do it that i can do it as good
45:28 - as a farrier
45:29 - so what i'm trying to say is you learn
45:32 - this girl
45:33 - and you will learn this for the rest of
45:35 - your life and everything you do you will
45:37 - be unstoppable
45:38 - it translates everywhere i love that so
45:40 - much and um i'm someone on this call
45:42 - who's not a software developer and i
45:44 - don't code right
45:45 - i work at grocery code on our programs
45:48 - um but i use excel
45:49 - all the time and i had to learn how to
45:51 - write formulas in excel which is
45:53 - in its own way telling a computer that
45:55 - you want it to do some math
45:57 - for you right and i had an issue the
46:00 - other day where i couldn't get my
46:01 - formula to work and i was about to throw
46:02 - my computer out the window
46:04 - and i was googling and i was googling
46:07 - and i was reading examples
46:08 - and i my partner who lives with me is a
46:11 - software developer and i was like i'm
46:12 - not asking him i'm gonna figure it out
46:14 - i'm gonna do it myself and i did figure
46:16 - it out and it was the best
46:17 - feeling i had all day when it finally
46:20 - worked so
46:20 - thank you very much it's the best it's
46:23 - the best
46:24 - yeah then you wanna tell your friends
46:25 - like when you ping people you're like
46:27 - hey
46:28 - deanna no joke i texted my best friend i
46:31 - saw
46:31 - my excel problem
46:35 - yeah um so we got the results of that
46:37 - poll which is really fascinating we're
46:39 - asking people how they like to learn
46:41 - and uh 40 said online tutorials and then
46:44 - another
46:45 - 27 said small groups and i think this is
46:48 - a great opportunity easy to your point
46:50 - make an accountability group with your
46:52 - friends like pick a course that you're
46:54 - going to do it can be free or it can be
46:56 - cheap or
46:57 - you can ask ask around and try to get
46:59 - some fundraising for it
47:00 - pick a course you're gonna do two or
47:02 - three other people and then make
47:03 - checkpoints every monday night we're
47:05 - gonna send each other our progress
47:06 - right like that's a way to help each
47:08 - other motivate um
47:10 - jessica did you have something you're
47:11 - muted oh yeah yeah
47:13 - i did so so i learned this early
47:16 - because i i taught computers if you can
47:19 - teach something that you learned
47:20 - you will remember it forever so if if
47:23 - you
47:24 - learn a little something bore your
47:27 - family to death and your friends
47:28 - and teach them and you will find
47:31 - that you will retain everything in life
47:35 - and it will be so valuable because
47:37 - you'll learn speaking skills you'll
47:38 - learn how to organize your thoughts
47:40 - and it'll build upon itself so if it's
47:43 - overwhelming
47:44 - find a way to teach it even if it's just
47:46 - a little bit
47:47 - and you'll find that you'll have more
47:48 - confidence that's
47:51 - such excellent advice um and then i i
47:53 - should plug girls who code college loops
47:55 - here
47:56 - so a college loop is a self-started
47:58 - group of women in college
48:00 - that you don't have to have been a girls
48:02 - who code alumni so if you didn't get to
48:03 - do one of our programs when you were
48:04 - younger it's not too late
48:07 - we're going to talk about that in a
48:08 - second um you it's not too late you find
48:11 - a couple of women at your college you
48:12 - make a college loop you go on our
48:14 - website to
48:14 - join us it's free it doesn't cost any
48:16 - money and we offer you some resources
48:19 - some ideas some activities tutorials
48:22 - we have a like how to get started with
48:24 - open source coding activity with you and
48:27 - your friends can do together
48:28 - so start a college loop oh thank you
48:30 - alyssa posted it in the chat that's
48:32 - awesome
48:32 - that's a great way to build and you can
48:34 - do whatever you want if you don't want
48:35 - to do our activities and you want to do
48:37 - the aws certification that's awesome too
48:40 - um i love our student who said i always
48:42 - talk to my dog talking to stuff out loud
48:44 - is so real
48:45 - all right we're going to do one final
48:47 - question here um i want to thank
48:49 - everyone in the audience who shared
48:50 - questions these have been so awesome
48:52 - the last one we have this came from you
48:54 - all when you registered is just stepping
48:56 - back more broadly
48:57 - a lot of folks are applying to
48:59 - internships right now first jobs
49:01 - how would you recommend preparing for
49:04 - these applications
49:05 - and one of the questions we got a lot is
49:07 - if you get asked something like
49:08 - are you familiar with xyz technology or
49:11 - have you ever done this before and the
49:12 - answer is no
49:14 - how do you respond to a question like
49:16 - that deanna you want to start us
49:18 - off yeah i am i used to interview a lot
49:21 - for my team so i feel like i've seen
49:22 - every which way of this and um hopefully
49:25 - have a good understanding of what
49:27 - companies might be looking for
49:28 - um so i think the first part is that you
49:31 - should always be honest
49:32 - right the first red flag in an interview
49:34 - is if someone
49:36 - falsely acclaims that they know
49:38 - something um because that then gives me
49:40 - the sign that
49:41 - i can ask you more questions on it right
49:43 - you're just all of a sudden digging
49:44 - a hole and that's not a position you
49:46 - want to be in you use that language
49:48 - analogy imagine someone says do you
49:49 - speak spanish and you say yes
49:51 - and then they ask you something in
49:52 - spanish like you're gonna get yourself
49:54 - in trouble
49:55 - exactly and then then you're off on kind
49:57 - of a wrong relationship with your
49:59 - interviewer they're not
50:00 - and really trusting of your your answers
50:03 - after that
50:03 - so instead i think it's much better to
50:05 - be straightforward so to
50:07 - your point emily of what happens when
50:08 - they ask you do you know xyz technology
50:11 - and you say no
50:13 - where does the conversation go then so i
50:16 - think the
50:16 - the next part to fall on is if you know
50:19 - something similar
50:20 - so you could say no i don't know that
50:22 - but i do know about this
50:24 - or in the event where you can't draw
50:25 - that parallel you could ask them to help
50:28 - you
50:28 - understand it better so that you might
50:30 - be able to provide more information
50:31 - on something that you do know so
50:34 - interviewers are are not trying to stump
50:38 - you
50:38 - or kick you out or anything like that
50:40 - they're looking for people to join their
50:42 - company that's why they're interviewing
50:43 - you
50:44 - right so they will try and help you
50:46 - through that
50:47 - um they just need to know that you need
50:49 - some help right so they won't be able to
50:51 - give you the cues of what that
50:52 - technology is if you don't ask
50:54 - so i think you know just kind of
50:55 - breaking down that it isn't this like
50:58 - end-all-be-all scary thing i remember
51:00 - going to interviews in college and being
51:02 - like just so sweaty the whole time
51:04 - and it was terrible and it doesn't have
51:06 - to be that way right it could be
51:08 - um a much more kind of
51:11 - engaging conversation between two people
51:13 - that are really trying to do something
51:14 - to help each other
51:15 - right you're looking for a job and
51:16 - they're looking for someone to join
51:18 - their team
51:19 - i love that um easy
51:22 - what's your advice yeah
51:26 - i think uh when you see all those buzz
51:30 - words or they actually all those buzz
51:32 - words now in text someone say cicd
51:34 - pipeline or jenkins they want to true
51:37 - all the supports what are you
51:39 - you say no i honestly i don't know it
51:42 - but i can learn it
51:43 - you know and then you quickly change the
51:45 - subjects to
51:46 - how you fixed a challenge that you
51:49 - didn't know
51:50 - anything about but you researched it you
51:52 - googled it
51:53 - you called a friend and so i think
51:58 - recruiters just want to see that desire
52:00 - and ability
52:02 - to learn and you know keep learning and
52:04 - solving the problem so
52:06 - i mean i i was coming from another
52:08 - country to to the us
52:10 - and i probably filled
52:14 - seven interviews before i got into
52:16 - accenture
52:18 - and so it took me a while to learn what
52:20 - the american recruiter was looking for
52:23 - and it's really just that honesty you
52:26 - know so i'll say no i don't know this
52:28 - but i can learn it if you give me some
52:30 - time i can learn it
52:32 - the other day you just quickly the other
52:34 - day i had this problem
52:36 - i didn't know it but this is how i
52:37 - solved it
52:39 - that's such good advice and i would just
52:40 - like to not to put a pin on this but did
52:43 - you hear her say that she had seven
52:45 - interviews that didn't go
52:46 - well before she got the job and this is
52:47 - a very impressive woman you've been
52:49 - hearing from
52:49 - so that's just a reminder that everybody
52:52 - doesn't get every job all the time
52:54 - it's okay sometime you know no matter
52:57 - how many credentials you have or how
52:59 - good you're feeling
53:00 - so thank you for sharing that that's a
53:01 - vulnerable thing to share and we
53:03 - appreciate it
53:04 - i was actually just going to jump in
53:05 - there really quick i do think like
53:07 - job fairs and career fairs are a great
53:09 - way to practice interviewing
53:11 - it is the skill that needs to be
53:13 - practiced right
53:14 - right right very true and jessica let's
53:18 - close out with your thoughts
53:20 - so interviewing is really tough i tend
53:22 - to get nervous and
53:24 - i stumble over my words and i can't
53:26 - remember acronyms to save my life
53:29 - i had a database interview and i
53:32 - couldn't describe a cluster
53:33 - and i'm walking out of the interview i
53:35 - cannot believe i couldn't answer
53:37 - the most fundamental thing in the
53:40 - interview i just couldn't answer it you
53:41 - know i'm like
53:43 - so try not to work yourself into
53:47 - a um into into a nervous bundle
53:50 - is first and foremost so find the things
53:52 - that you can do to
53:53 - relax yourself so that you're able to
53:55 - answer the questions
53:57 - if you need a tool i need a tool i have
54:00 - a tool right now this is
54:02 - just a necklace that broke and i sit
54:04 - here and mess with it because
54:05 - it allows me to think without getting
54:07 - nervous looking at my picture and
54:09 - analyzing things
54:10 - so um find things that you need
54:14 - to make yourself comfortable because um
54:16 - people want to be comfortable with you
54:18 - and if you're too nervous they start
54:20 - interpreting that so
54:22 - give yourself a chance to kind of work
54:24 - through the bundle of nerves and then
54:26 - i do the same thing as he does i don't
54:28 - know
54:29 - but this is how i solve things i don't
54:33 - know
54:34 - um and i will tell you that
54:38 - it's changed over the years but as a
54:40 - female they expected me not to know
54:43 - anything
54:43 - and i can't tell you how many times in
54:45 - my career it has been
54:47 - you always surprised me you know like i
54:50 - i really didn't expect that out of you
54:52 - you know so i
54:53 - i people don't expect what they get out
54:55 - of me i'm always
54:56 - underestimated and it's my superpower so
55:00 - um i don't worry about it too much i let
55:03 - people underestimate me
55:04 - and i don't try to be a champion of
55:06 - words and i'm just not super nimble with
55:09 - words
55:10 - a lot of people are that's not my
55:11 - superpower but i'm a really good
55:13 - troubleshooter and i'm a good researcher
55:15 - and so i know that and i find the places
55:18 - where i fit
55:19 - and i've i've not gotten more jobs than
55:21 - i've gotten
55:22 - and i've had jobs that i haven't liked
55:25 - and i've moved on and and so you you
55:27 - have to do that in your career you have
55:29 - to decide
55:30 - this is who i am and this is how i move
55:32 - through the world
55:34 - and you learn from every experience and
55:36 - then you find the next opportunity and
55:38 - and and you just find your place and you
55:40 - can do it
