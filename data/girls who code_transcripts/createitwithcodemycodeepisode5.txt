00:00 - I
00:05 - hey guys it's Janet Marga here's Audrey
00:08 - here Brittany here in today's episode my
00:11 - code is called create it with code we
00:13 - will be talking about what you can
00:15 - create and what we have created with
00:17 - code let's get started
00:19 - cody is one of the most creative skills
00:21 - of person can have with code you can
00:23 - write software for literally any
00:24 - technology it's like a paintbrush or
00:27 - canvas that will help you make your next
00:29 - masterpiece not only can you program
00:31 - something technical like saving
00:33 - usernames and passwords you can program
00:35 - an effective video game and the list of
00:37 - things that you can create with code is
00:39 - endless because you can create things
00:41 - with code that have never been made
00:42 - before with code you can do anything you
00:44 - want with the technology that's always
00:46 - around you you can turn your slideshow
00:48 - into a website or you can code a video
00:51 - game for your English project I've
00:55 - created a few games through code one was
00:58 - a ping-pong game that was space themed
00:59 - where the ball was an alien egg and you
01:01 - had to shoot it up at the stars to gain
01:03 - more points after seeing the negative
01:05 - effects of anonymous social media
01:07 - something I created with code was a
01:09 - website that allows you to send other
01:11 - people complements I've created a few
01:13 - websites with code one of these is my
01:15 - personal website which is basically just
01:17 - a digital resume that I can send any
01:19 - tech companies that I'm applying for
01:20 - jobs with some other minigames I've
01:22 - created our color code GREEN healthy
01:24 - buns and space cleaners in code green
01:26 - and healthy bunch I worked with other
01:28 - girls to inform players how to recycle
01:30 - and how to make healthier food choices I
01:33 - also made my own original game which was
01:35 - kind of similar to Oregon Trail it was a
01:36 - survival game where the player had to be
01:38 - on an island and try to escape the
01:39 - island while also keeping themselves fed
01:41 - watered and rested and not dying from
01:43 - all the dangers of the island I want to
01:48 - create video games with code while the
01:49 - few text-based games that I've worked on
01:51 - have been really fun to code they're not
01:53 - quite up to the stand
01:54 - that most people expect from video games
01:56 - today so someday I hope that I can make
01:58 - games that have full-on physics awesome
02:00 - mechanics pretty good graphics millions
02:02 - of people drive to work every single day
02:04 - with only one person in the car with
02:06 - code I can create an app that makes it
02:08 - easier for people to carpool as I
02:10 - advance my programming skills I want to
02:12 - be able to open up my own school a
02:14 - school where students will learn science
02:16 - math all the other subjects and be able
02:19 - to tie it back with code I want to
02:21 - create a lot more games of code because
02:23 - I love making them and I love playing
02:25 - the monks are done I also like adding
02:27 - cool objectives and features and
02:29 - different levels and letting my friends
02:31 - try them out so by now it's pretty
02:33 - obvious that all your favorite things
02:35 - that you use each and every day were
02:37 - created with code and that's why I code
02:40 - because I want to create really cool
02:41 - things that people can rely on each and
02:44 - every day in order to make all these
02:45 - things we have all gone through a bunch
02:47 - of trial and error and that is a huge
02:49 - part of coding that's what we cover next
02:51 - week
02:52 - how coding has made us more confident
02:53 - you can check out our past episodes up
02:56 - here and if you want to join our
02:57 - conversation comment below see you next
02:59 - week see you next week see you next week
03:01 - bye
