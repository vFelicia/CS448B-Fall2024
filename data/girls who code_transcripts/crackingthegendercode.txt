00:03 - today computing skills are the most
00:06 - sought after in United States that
00:08 - women's share of the computing workforce
00:10 - is falling new research from Accenture
00:13 - and girls who code shows us that if
00:16 - nothing is done to close the gender gap
00:17 - only one in five computing jobs will be
00:20 - held by women in years time in 2015
00:25 - there were half a million new computing
00:27 - jobs and less than 40,000 new computer
00:29 - science grads so the gender gap will
00:31 - have severe consequences for the US
00:33 - economy
00:35 - the theis decline can be reversed we can
00:39 - triple the number of women in computing
00:41 - by 2025 but 3.9 million pushing their
00:46 - share of the work force to 39 percent
00:48 - but we must act now we need to spark the
00:53 - interest of girls in junior high by
00:56 - informing parents and teachers better
00:57 - about the wider importance of computing
00:59 - we need to sustain their engagement in
01:02 - high school where girls initial interest
01:04 - often competes with social factors in
01:07 - college we need to inspire young women
01:09 - toward a career and computing the role
01:12 - models
01:13 - summer immersion programs and mentoring
01:16 - it's time to take action because we need
01:19 - more women in computing it's time to
01:22 - crack the code together
