00:00 - everyone for participating in that poll
00:02 - will have a couple more as we go tonight
00:04 - but now that we are all acquainted let's
00:06 - move on to our panel discussion much
00:10 - like the last session we've designed
00:13 - tonight's questions to address the
00:15 - concerns of our college aged alumni and
00:17 - students across the country who are
00:19 - either at the very beginning in the
00:22 - middle of or ending their college
00:24 - experience and we're gonna start with
00:26 - the effects of covin 19 for those
00:28 - earliest in their college experience are
00:31 - rising or first-year students I'm sure
00:35 - that we've all read and our panelists
00:37 - have certain written have certainly
00:38 - written about and covered the impact of
00:41 - Kovan 19 on a number of different
00:43 - industries our inbox is full of
00:46 - questions from students who are just
00:48 - beginning their college journeys and are
00:50 - concerned about what this means for them
00:51 - long term so our first question is this
00:55 - is the tech industry recession-proof or
00:59 - will the pandemic impact tech companies
01:02 - and tech hiring Claire this question is
01:09 - right up your alley so let's start with
01:11 - you yes so I think this is a really
01:15 - interesting question right now because
01:17 - there's the question of is tech
01:19 - recession-proof
01:20 - and then the coalbed related recession I
01:22 - think is is sort of a different ballgame
01:25 - you know on one hand I think that all
01:28 - companies you know at some point will be
01:31 - touched by the economic downturn you
01:33 - know tech companies in particular might
01:35 - lose the sorts of business deals you
01:38 - know they're providing tech services to
01:39 - other businesses businesses we're
01:42 - experiencing a cash crunch might rethink
01:44 - whether they're spending that money but
01:46 - I think that you know something that
01:48 - koban 19 has really sort of created is
01:52 - an acceleration of sort of the digital
01:56 - transformation that we're seeing I mean
01:58 - we're experiencing that right now that
02:00 - we're all talking on the student call
02:01 - and businesses are working remotely
02:03 - people are going to school remotely and
02:05 - it's been sort of a scramble to figure
02:07 - out how do we do that how do we do that
02:09 - better and so I think that it's actually
02:12 - a really excite
02:13 - an opportunity for the tech space right
02:15 - now to start to think about how you know
02:18 - how can the industry drive that
02:19 - transformation improve the way that
02:21 - we're working right now although I think
02:23 - things will start to sort of go back to
02:25 - normal we're also gonna see more and
02:27 - more businesses figuring out like Oh can
02:29 - I be more flexible with my workforce can
02:31 - I let more people work from home you
02:33 - know what's up what kinds of automation
02:35 - do we need in order to you know work
02:38 - more effectively in this new environment
02:40 - and so I think that there'll be a lot of
02:42 - opportunities both for so if the big
02:44 - tech companies to drive that kind of
02:46 - change but also potentially in the
02:48 - startup space you know new idea it's
02:50 - coming for it forward how to address the
02:54 - kinds of problems that we're in and so I
02:55 - think that you know even if the tech
02:58 - space is touched in this moment that we
03:00 - may see it you know come out of the sort
03:03 - of economic downturn more quickly and
03:05 - jump on those kinds of opportunities
03:10 - that makes sense tonight I know that
03:12 - resonates with me at least as a consumer
03:15 - of tech and all the tech that I'm using
03:17 - now that we're working from home
03:19 - Courtney is are you seeing something
03:21 - similar does that resonate with you yeah
03:24 - so just to piggyback off of what Claire
03:26 - said um I don't know if we can really
03:28 - say that tech is recession-proof I think
03:31 - we're seeing covet 19 impact all
03:33 - industries and all companies in some way
03:35 - shape or form but I do think as Claire
03:38 - said it is causing a lot of companies to
03:39 - rethink how they go about hiring to
03:42 - rethink how they go about operating
03:43 - their workforce I mean we heard I can't
03:45 - remember if it was earlier this week or
03:47 - last week where Twitter you know the CEO
03:49 - Jack Dorsey now said that employees will
03:51 - be able to work from home forever
03:52 - I read something we know Google will
03:54 - allow employees that work from home you
03:55 - know at least to the end of the year and
03:57 - so I do think a lot of companies if they
03:58 - haven't already
03:59 - before the pandemic they will start to
04:01 - think about the value of having more
04:03 - flexibility and how they can work that
04:06 - into their workforce in Courtney as a
04:12 - follow up do you think hiring will stay
04:14 - steady as a result or are you expecting
04:18 - it to kind of dip in the short term um I
04:21 - think it depends on what type of company
04:24 - in with industry I mean I know even in
04:25 - my own recording I've spoken to a lot of
04:27 - economists and they speak a lot about
04:29 - how even though we've seen you know cuts
04:32 - or you know layoffs in a lot of
04:34 - different industries but we're also
04:36 - seeing like an increase in telehealth
04:38 - and so what does that mean for people
04:40 - who work in technology so I do think
04:41 - that this is a time period where I think
04:43 - sometimes when you think of tech jobs
04:45 - you do only think of like the Google's
04:46 - the Facebook's the Twitter's but I think
04:48 - that's the time for it you know
04:49 - especially college students and those
04:52 - who are graduating to really open their
04:53 - eyes up to what other companies may have
04:55 - positions open so is that a telehealth
04:58 - company how can I be a benefit is it a
05:00 - finance company that's looking for
05:02 - somebody in their tech department I mean
05:03 - literally every industry has a tech
05:05 - department so I think this is really a
05:06 - time to just kind of like maybe open up
05:08 - your eyes to see what other industries
05:10 - my skillsets and experience to be useful
05:12 - for that's such a great point thank you
05:16 - is what we see a girls who code that
05:19 - Tech is transforming every industry and
05:21 - so it's not just
05:23 - tackett's financial services its
05:25 - consumer packaged goods companies its
05:27 - healthcare companies that are all
05:30 - becoming tech companies and doing tech
05:32 - hiring all right and thank you for
05:37 - sharing our next question is going to be
05:38 - geared towards assisting current college
05:41 - students whose academic experience has
05:44 - been completely redesigned in the last
05:46 - couple weeks and then as we know next
05:49 - year as well so the question is Scott
05:53 - Galloway who is a marketing professor
05:55 - who predicted both Amazon's Whole Foods
05:58 - purchase and spoke about weworks IPO a
06:02 - month before it's actually decline it
06:04 - actually declined is now projecting that
06:07 - big tech companies will take over the
06:09 - higher education space and we've seen
06:12 - this model before in the past where tech
06:15 - giants have teamed up with elite
06:17 - universities like MIT and Google
06:19 - Microsoft Berkeley Harvard and Facebook
06:23 - so our poll question for audience
06:26 - members we're gonna ask you would you be
06:29 - interested in attending a college or
06:31 - university that partners with tech
06:33 - companies and like last time you'll have
06:36 - 30 seconds to respond and while we wait
06:40 - for responses Claire and Courtney a
06:42 - question for you is going to be are you
06:44 - seeing a rise in industry and university
06:47 - partnerships and what opportunities do
06:50 - these collaborations present for current
06:53 - students or matriculating students I'm
07:00 - just going to wait a minute to see the
07:02 - poll responses
07:15 - Wow so an overwhelming 96% of you said
07:20 - yes you would be interested thanks so
07:22 - much for your candor that's a really
07:24 - interesting place to start our
07:25 - conversation I'm so corny I'd like to
07:28 - start with you this time what are your
07:29 - thoughts on whether we're gonna see a
07:31 - rise in these types of partnerships and
07:33 - what they mean for students yeah so um I
07:36 - do hope that we see a rise in these type
07:39 - of partnerships I won't be surprised if
07:41 - we do especially considering the time
07:44 - here that we're in I do I have seen like
07:46 - a lot of companies are now looking for
07:47 - virtual interns and so I do feel like if
07:50 - they already had that relationship with
07:52 - different universities and they may not
07:53 - you know if there isn't this big college
07:55 - forever they already have relationship
07:57 - let's say for instance you know the
07:59 - technology department at Yale or the
08:01 - technology department at Georgia State
08:03 - University this will really help them to
08:05 - stream that pipeline of hey we're
08:07 - looking for interns and we're looking
08:09 - for entry-level employees let's partner
08:11 - with this University and see who they
08:13 - have in the pipeline
08:13 - I think programs like that are super
08:15 - important because I think a lot of times
08:17 - sometimes in the tech industry you hear
08:21 - about people from the same University is
08:22 - getting the same opportunities and so I
08:24 - do think that these type of partnerships
08:25 - allow companies to broaden their horizon
08:28 - where they're looking at talent and it
08:29 - allows students who are graduating is I
08:32 - had access to mentorship to have access
08:35 - to sponsorship which is super important
08:37 - from the start of your career to the end
08:39 - of your career and so I do hope that we
08:41 - do see an influx of these partnerships
08:43 - between universities and big companies
08:49 - and I think your your point about how do
08:52 - we make sure that we're bringing those
08:54 - opportunities not just to our very elite
08:56 - schools but to community colleges to
08:59 - HBCUs to state colleges where the vast
09:03 - majority of our students are going is so
09:05 - important and hopefully something that
09:09 - that tech companies will be interested
09:11 - in Claire what are your thoughts gee is
09:15 - this something that you see that could
09:17 - kind of further democratize access to
09:19 - education is it something that's gonna
09:21 - remain among the elite schools and and
09:23 - what does it mean for students yeah I
09:26 - think sort of along the lines of what
09:28 - Courtney was saying I also hope that we
09:30 - see more of these kinds of partnerships
09:32 - I think something that this moment in
09:34 - time has against would have accelerated
09:38 - is or brought to light as how valuable
09:41 - Sciences and whether it's computer
09:43 - science whether it's other types of
09:44 - science you know how important it is to
09:47 - be able to move quickly when problems
09:50 - arise to address those things and I
09:52 - think a lot of times computer science is
09:54 - a valuable way of doing that tech is a
09:56 - valuable way of doing that you know I
09:58 - think of IBM and the cloud computing
10:00 - sorry excuse me the supercomputing
10:03 - consortium that they've created to help
10:05 - develop vaccines and treatments for
10:07 - coronavirus I think that you know
10:10 - another way great way of accelerating
10:12 - the science that we do is Department
10:15 - with these universities whether it be
10:17 - those you know top universities that we
10:20 - think of ORS you know big state
10:21 - universities community colleges like you
10:23 - said I think that those that those
10:26 - partnerships can be really valuable in
10:28 - sort of moving science forward and
10:30 - addressing the kinds of problems that
10:32 - we're seeing today and I would agree
10:35 - with you I think that it's important
10:36 - that that again we see these kinds of
10:38 - partnerships of all kinds of
10:40 - universities and I would encourage
10:42 - students to look at you know is it not
10:44 - just the big you know as does Google
10:46 - have a partnership with my University
10:47 - but what kinds of companies in my local
10:49 - area are wanting to be involved with my
10:52 - university and whether you know you take
10:54 - the class that gets you into that lab or
10:56 - not and if if a company is on campus and
10:59 - wanting to be involved with students
11:00 - that's not proper tunity to reach our
11:03 - say you know you know what kinds of
11:05 - opportunities are available at your
11:06 - company or can I sit down and have an
11:08 - informational interview with you
11:09 - especially while everybody is sitting at
11:11 - home right now I think it's a good time
11:13 - to try and you know ask for networking
11:16 - ask for advice and so yeah I do hope we
11:18 - see more of those kinds of partnerships
11:21 - Claire you mentioned some really kind of
11:23 - practical things that could benefit
11:26 - students as a result of these
11:27 - partnerships can you expand on that a
11:29 - little bit more both what could
11:31 - potentially be available available on
11:34 - campus and as well off-campus at the
11:36 - companies themselves yeah I mean I think
11:39 - you know again like you may be able to
11:43 - get into a lab and do some research or
11:46 - work with an executive maybe there's an
11:48 - executive from a company that's running
11:50 - a lab or partnering with a professor I
11:52 - think a lot of times and you know
11:54 - professors that work at universities are
11:57 - a good place to start a lot of times
11:59 - those folks are still really connected
12:01 - within the industry and so I think it's
12:04 - a good you know it's a good place to
12:05 - start with networking and that can be a
12:07 - really scary word sometimes you know
12:10 - like sounds sounds a little I don't know
12:12 - it to me it always this is a little
12:14 - scary and so I think that I think that
12:17 - that's a really good place to start in
12:18 - terms of making connections with people
12:20 - in the industry it can feel a little
12:22 - less scary if you already have that
12:23 - connection of oh we're both connected to
12:25 - this University and so you know can I
12:27 - take you with it right now you can't
12:28 - take anybody for coffee but can I sit
12:30 - down and have an informational interview
12:31 - or you know can I ask your advice on
12:35 - what books by industry leaders I should
12:37 - be reading right now as I'm as I'm
12:39 - hoping to get in industry I think those
12:40 - are really really cool opportunities
12:42 - that having a company connected to a
12:44 - university can provide
12:46 - [Music]
12:48 - great thank you for that I think that
12:51 - practical advice is really useful to is
12:53 - we think about these bigger questions so
12:56 - now we are gonna turn to what next steps
13:00 - are student to be graduates it should be
13:02 - thinking about in taking and as we see
13:06 - companies restructure in response to
13:08 - covet and invest more in things like AI
13:12 - and automation it seems like technology
13:16 - is more vital than ever and we know this
13:18 - impacts the job market and it will lead
13:20 - to a shift in the type of candidates
13:22 - that employers will be looking for so
13:26 - what roles and skill sets are currently
13:28 - in highest demand and TAC and kind of
13:31 - the adjacent industry is like FinTech or
13:34 - healthTap Courtney is you're our careers
13:38 - expert I would love to start with you
13:40 - what have you seen since the onset of
13:42 - koban 19 um so yeah so just in some of
13:47 - my reporting and interviewing and
13:49 - interviewing and talking to different
13:50 - people like I mentioned earlier
13:52 - especially considering the time period
13:54 - that we're in the telehealth industry is
13:57 - definitely hiring a lot but beyond that
14:00 - I think just in terms of the skills that
14:03 - employers are looking for especially now
14:05 - where for the time being there isn't a
14:07 - lot of face-to-face interaction so they
14:09 - really are looking for people who have
14:10 - like amazing verbal and written
14:12 - communication skills and I think that's
14:13 - across any industry because a lot of
14:16 - times especially during this time period
14:17 - you're reaching out to people over email
14:19 - you're having a virtual phone interview
14:21 - with that internship if you are doing a
14:23 - virtual internship you're speaking to
14:24 - your boss or your mentor whoever over
14:27 - Skype or over zoom and so people are
14:28 - really want to make sure that we have
14:30 - young people come in who can communicate
14:31 - effectively as well as like I'm seeing a
14:34 - lot of employers talking about emotional
14:36 - intelligence and being able to like
14:37 - really be able to manage certain issues
14:40 - as they arise and might be able to like
14:42 - emotionally communicate how you're
14:44 - getting through it how you're managing
14:45 - it I think this is a crazy time for you
14:47 - for all of us but I do think that
14:49 - written in verbal communication is just
14:52 - super important I think that those are
14:54 - two skills that regardless of the time
14:56 - period they're going to always be needed
14:57 - I think regardless of the industry or go
15:00 - is of what level
15:01 - employers are always looking for that
15:03 - and yeah and like I said telehealth is
15:06 - like the number one industry that comes
15:07 - to mind right now and and also you know
15:10 - like I said in in finance I was looking
15:13 - online the other day and I see how like
15:15 - Bank of America they have open positions
15:17 - in various different departments and
15:20 - even with that with their internship
15:21 - program they're still saying they're
15:22 - going to pay their interns for the full
15:24 - 10 weeks of the internship program and
15:26 - so I think that's that's a bright spot
15:28 - in the midst of what's going on when you
15:30 - do hear that some companies are taking
15:32 - back their internships I think now it's
15:34 - a good time to look at what companies
15:35 - aren't and to see how you can fit your
15:37 - foot in the door there and what
15:38 - departments are looking for interns or
15:40 - entry-level positions thank you for that
15:45 - Courtney are you seeing that companies
15:47 - want specific majors or minors or they
15:50 - move more focused on skills like writing
15:53 - and communication like you said I think
15:56 - the good thing is they're more focused
15:58 - on skills I think we hear all the time
16:00 - about how some people may have a degree
16:02 - in a certain career field and then when
16:04 - they graduate they go in and pursue a
16:06 - career and it's completely different
16:08 - field and so I think the good thing is
16:11 - like a lot of companies are open to
16:12 - saying like okay even though we might
16:14 - you might be a finance company but we
16:15 - aren't only looking at people with an
16:17 - accounting degree we are only looking at
16:19 - people who majored in economics like
16:21 - we're open to people who majored in
16:23 - whatever it's subject but as long as
16:25 - they had the skills that we're looking
16:26 - for as long as they have like the
16:28 - determination that we're looking for and
16:29 - they can prove that like they can
16:30 - actually get the job done they can help
16:32 - us to solve problems they can prove that
16:34 - they can be a value to our company I
16:35 - think really is more so about the skills
16:37 - that you bring to the table and how you
16:39 - communicate those skills is super
16:41 - important that's great to hear
16:43 - Claire have you seen something similar
16:46 - yeah I think I think that Courtney made
16:50 - a lot of good points about those soft
16:51 - skills that are really important I think
16:53 - that right now companies are looking for
16:55 - people who are flexible and adaptable
16:57 - because of this really weird situation
16:59 - and so I think that right now could be a
17:02 - really good time to demonstrate that
17:04 - you're able to do that you know whether
17:06 - it's that you have a virtual internship
17:07 - and so you need to be even better about
17:09 - sort of keeping track of still
17:12 - connecting with people who you're
17:13 - working with or you know
17:14 - maybe maybe the internship situation is
17:17 - more challenging and so you do some
17:19 - freelance work you know that sort of
17:21 - thing I think that that being able to
17:23 - prove that you you know don't only need
17:26 - to work in in one way and sitting in to
17:29 - ask adieu your work there I think that
17:30 - right now is obviously more important
17:32 - than ever I think - you know maybe kind
17:36 - of an exciting thing about the time that
17:38 - we're in is that companies of all kinds
17:41 - like we've talked about are looking for
17:42 - to be able to transform and are looking
17:45 - for solutions and nobody really knows
17:47 - what the right answer is and I think
17:49 - that means that the right answer could
17:50 - come from anybody it doesn't need to be
17:52 - the leadership in the company who says
17:53 - you know I have an idea about how we can
17:56 - do things I think that you know
17:58 - everybody here everybody in this program
17:59 - has been willing to step out and put
18:01 - themselves maybe in a in a situation
18:03 - that's slightly less comfortable than
18:04 - they might like and so I think you know
18:07 - if you have an idea if you're willing to
18:09 - be a little bit creative and speak up
18:11 - about that it's a good time to kind of
18:13 - be brave and raise your hand and be
18:15 - willing to try things or put yourself
18:16 - out there a little bit I think I think
18:19 - that you know is hopefully sort of a
18:22 - hopeful thing about this moment that
18:24 - we're in and then again I think as far
18:26 - as sort of specific industry trends
18:29 - again in the sort of AI automation
18:32 - telehealth obviously is a great example
18:35 - of that you know all companies will be
18:37 - looking to make this digital
18:38 - transformation so maybe being creative
18:40 - in thinking about your career path and
18:43 - not just thinking about the big tech
18:44 - giants but what are some other smaller
18:46 - companies that might be looking to make
18:47 - this transition and need that the skills
18:49 - and the help that you could provide in
18:51 - doing that I think that's a good place
18:53 - to look that's great thank you and I
18:57 - love that you use the word bravery which
19:00 - is one of our core values of girls who
19:01 - code in something that we talk a lot
19:03 - about and teach in our programs we see
19:07 - that girls are going to need to be open
19:10 - to raising their hands even when they're
19:11 - not sure because that's what boys are
19:13 - doing and it's interesting to hear that
19:17 - particularly in this time of a lot of
19:19 - uncertainty that you think that applies
19:21 - EE in the workforce as well so thank you
19:26 - clear and Courtney for an amazing panel
19:28 - discussion we are going to now
19:30 - transition into the Q&A portion of our
19:33 - evening we've selected questions from
19:37 - our girls who code alumni and community
19:39 - who are viewing this conversation and
19:42 - would like further guidance about
19:44 - navigating the tech industry during this
19:47 - pandemic we've selected three we I heard
19:51 - before the call that we got 150 and so
19:53 - hopefully we address some of those
19:55 - already and please keep asking questions
19:58 - and the chat our team is there to answer
20:01 - them as well the first question comes
20:04 - from Michelle Jay her question is
20:08 - globally most industries are
20:10 - implementing work from home policies due
20:12 - to this epidemic well companies be more
20:15 - susceptible to accepting applications
20:17 - from international candidates Courtney
20:20 - this was something that you mentioned
20:22 - and your response I think to our first
20:25 - question about work from home and more
20:28 - flexibility can you expand on what you
20:31 - think companies are gonna be open to in
20:34 - terms of where they're willing to hire
20:36 - from yes I do think that will be one of
20:41 - the beauties of greater flexibility and
20:42 - the option to work from home is that not
20:45 - only will companies be able to tap into
20:47 - a greater network of talent but
20:49 - employees will also be able to tap into
20:52 - companies who may not be per se located
20:55 - in their particular City I know right
20:58 - now even if you look just within the US
21:01 - you you know especially when you're
21:02 - looking at tech you automatically think
21:03 - of like the New York and the San
21:05 - Francisco and maybe like Austin but
21:06 - those are places where everyone can't
21:08 - live whether it's you know it's for
21:09 - various reasons but those are also like
21:11 - expensive cities and so I do think the
21:13 - benefit of if more companies are open to
21:15 - a remote workforce is that they will be
21:17 - looking to hire people regardless of
21:20 - location as long as you have the skill
21:21 - sets they were looking for then we're
21:23 - looking to talk to you I think also one
21:25 - benefit is if companies do already have
21:27 - an international presence which a lot of
21:28 - big companies do I think they may be
21:30 - open to like I said even expanding that
21:34 - internationally in terms of you know
21:36 - when they're looking for different
21:37 - positions well hey if we already have a
21:39 - small team in London
21:42 - I don't see any harm in hiring an issue
21:43 - of a person remotely there or in turn
21:45 - remotely there to work there and
21:48 - communicate with all of us so I do think
21:50 - that is the benefit and I think it'll be
21:52 - beneficial for both employers and
21:53 - employees it just expands the network of
21:56 - the talent that's coming in and
21:57 - providing you know people who are
22:00 - looking for jobs with more opportunities
22:02 - to look for jobs outside of their one
22:04 - particular area thanks for that intro
22:09 - Courtney Clare I'm curious how you would
22:12 - respond to this question yeah I think I
22:15 - think again this is gonna be something
22:17 - that you know hopefully will be a
22:18 - benefit coming out of this is this
22:20 - increased flexibility and I also think
22:23 - it's sort of an opportunity maybe to to
22:25 - differentiate yourself if you live in a
22:27 - place that's not you know like Courtney
22:29 - mentioned one of the big tech hubs San
22:31 - Francisco the New York and you know the
22:33 - the customers that tech companies serve
22:36 - are not just on the coasts and so being
22:39 - able to say you know I'm someone who
22:40 - understands a different place and what
22:42 - the people in a different place need and
22:44 - how they interact with technology in a
22:45 - way that that maybe it's different I
22:47 - think that that being able to bring that
22:49 - outside perspective that you know those
22:52 - places those tech hubs can be kind of
22:54 - insular kind of a bubble and so I think
22:56 - that yeah being able to say I have a
22:59 - different perspective and that's really
23:00 - an asset and now it's easy for you to
23:03 - hire me because you figured out your
23:04 - work remote situation I think hopefully
23:08 - that will be something positive that
23:09 - comes out of this whole situation
23:12 - Thank You Claire and I guess a follow-up
23:15 - question to both of you are there things
23:17 - that you think international candidates
23:19 - could do to differentiate themselves
23:22 - from US candidates i Claire you offered
23:26 - the kind of perspective of being outside
23:29 - the US are there other types of things
23:31 - that you think would be beneficial for
23:33 - international candidates applying for
23:35 - what what used to be us-based jobs yeah
23:39 - I mean I think a trend that we're seeing
23:41 - in the tech industry is you know the
23:44 - attempt to move into international
23:46 - markets emerging markets
23:48 - and so many of the ways that that again
23:51 - those people in different markets
23:53 - interact with
23:54 - ecology is different and so having that
23:56 - you know I think you know the way that
23:58 - people use money and a lot of the tech
24:00 - companies are trying to get in to get
24:02 - into e-commerce get into the FinTech
24:03 - space so saying I have an understanding
24:06 - of how people in my country in my
24:08 - community use money would use digital
24:10 - technology in that way telehealth I
24:13 - think is another example just you know
24:15 - being able to think about and really
24:17 - sort of explain that that outside
24:20 - perspective that you bring being from a
24:22 - different place that's certainly
24:24 - something that tech companies are
24:26 - looking to do so I think that that could
24:29 - be really valuable
24:33 - Courtney I see you not did you have
24:35 - anything to add um no yeah I just
24:38 - completely agree with Claire I think as
24:42 - she said you know with when a lot of
24:43 - tech companies that they're looking to
24:45 - go to tap into international
24:47 - marketplaces it's always good if you
24:49 - know you can come to this table and
24:50 - you're willing to be vocal about hey I
24:52 - know what our consumers want in this
24:54 - particular area I know in a lot of times
24:57 - su there's different workplace cultures
24:58 - and so companies want to be able to
25:01 - smoothly transition into that with
25:03 - someone who's right there and who's on
25:04 - the ground and so I think if you can
25:06 - bring that to a company I think that
25:08 - really sets you apart and to be honest
25:10 - it also helps saves a company money
25:12 - because then they don't have to worry
25:13 - about someone in state that they're
25:16 - having to travel and worry about
25:17 - relocation and you're right there and
25:19 - you can tell them firsthand hey this is
25:21 - what consumers want here hey this is
25:22 - what may work here and may not work
25:24 - where you are but this is what works
25:26 - here and I think that could be really
25:28 - valuable to a company thanks Courtney
25:32 - and yes I was just reading an article
25:33 - this morning about what all what work
25:36 - from home means for commercial real
25:38 - estate and companies that have invested
25:40 - in these massive office towers or
25:42 - campuses that may no longer need them
25:44 - anymore so it is really interesting to
25:46 - see these big systemic shifts that are
25:48 - going to be happening we're already
25:50 - happening our next question is from rod
25:54 - Etha a as the hiring environment changes
25:58 - due to coded are there any emerging or
26:00 - niche fields that will satisfy needs for
26:03 - technology employers Courtney Clare up
26:10 - to you who who wants to take this first
26:13 - um so yeah I think as we both mentioned
26:17 - earlier I know we've said it multiple
26:20 - times but telehealth because that isn't
26:22 - going anywhere anytime soon Claire
26:24 - mentioned a lot about AI and automation
26:27 - and I think just in general this has
26:30 - really this time period for a lot of
26:32 - companies if they didn't already have a
26:33 - digital presence if they did it already
26:35 - take the need for them to be digital
26:37 - seriously I think this time area is
26:39 - forcing them to which means I think what
26:41 - that is going to come at increasing them
26:43 - realize I'm like oh hey actually we do
26:45 - need a software engineer
26:46 - actually we do need more people in our
26:48 - tech program to help us with these tech
26:50 - issues that we're having and so I do
26:52 - think that this will force a lot of
26:54 - companies to really invest in like their
26:56 - digital presence which in turn will lead
26:58 - them to needing to hire more people to
27:00 - help them make that transition to tech
27:05 - Claire I've been wondering if since
27:07 - we've talked a lot about these
27:09 - industries that are rising in the wake
27:11 - of Cova that we'll need digital skills
27:13 - even more I'm wondering if you have some
27:15 - practical tips about where you can find
27:17 - these jobs and places to look for people
27:20 - who are searching for some in these more
27:23 - particular niches yeah I think I was
27:27 - thinking a little bit about this and and
27:29 - you know it's almost like being a
27:31 - college senior being somebody who's
27:33 - hunting for a job you're kind of
27:34 - newsgathering about your industry and so
27:37 - I was thinking about how I sort of look
27:39 - for trends and you know try to follow
27:42 - these kinds of things I think you know
27:44 - following industry leaders on linkedin
27:47 - or on twitter a lot of times you know
27:49 - maybe they're not saying hey i need
27:51 - somebody who could do X because we're
27:53 - trying to take our company in this
27:54 - direction but maybe they're saying well
27:56 - I'm really excited about this new
27:58 - opportunity for our company or this new
28:00 - direction or we're trying something new
28:01 - and and that's sort of a hinge like oh
28:03 - you know they're gonna need people who
28:05 - know how to do that kind of thing then
28:07 - that kind of direction so I think that's
28:10 - one really a great way again I think you
28:12 - know going to going to mentor is going
28:15 - to professor ism saying what are you
28:17 - most excited about about you know where
28:19 - where tech is going right now what what
28:22 - this whole thing is going to change I
28:24 - think that you know getting the getting
28:26 - the discussion started that way you know
28:28 - what are you excited about what what you
28:30 - know is the most important thing for
28:32 - your company right now I think that's
28:35 - sort of a good way to get into having
28:37 - those kinds of conversations with people
28:38 - that might lead to an internship or a
28:41 - job or you know just a you know in a new
28:44 - way of thinking about your career path
28:48 - that's a great point about using your
28:51 - professors as a resource and even former
28:54 - professors if your school has already
28:56 - ended I'm sure they kind of have their
28:59 - fingers on the pulse of what's happening
29:01 - right now in their industries and are
29:03 - wanting to point graduates in the right
29:05 - direction Courtney are there any tips
29:07 - that you would provide for how to find
29:10 - these jobs
29:13 - um yes I still would say rely on your
29:17 - Career Resource Center send them an
29:19 - email and ask them where certain alumni
29:22 - are working at and if they're willing to
29:23 - connect with you I would also say there
29:25 - are various different platforms out
29:27 - there like I know handshake is one
29:28 - platform where they spotlight a lot of
29:31 - career opportunities and I was just
29:32 - looking at this like the other day and
29:34 - they have positions on there of
29:36 - companies like Amazon and Facebook and
29:38 - Apple that who are looking for
29:39 - entry-level positions as well as
29:41 - internships there's also a new platform
29:43 - that I just found out about this living
29:45 - called hiring 2020 and that's also their
29:47 - twitter name and they're also
29:49 - specifically spotlighting companies that
29:52 - are looking for interns as well as
29:54 - entry-level positions for the class of
29:56 - 2020 and on there like I said that's
29:58 - where I found out about the Bank of
29:59 - America position and how they're still
30:01 - looking for interns and they're looking
30:03 - to still pay them for the 10-week ten
30:05 - weeks if they're completing their
30:07 - internship and so there are a couple of
30:09 - different platforms out there I think
30:11 - this is a time period where social media
30:13 - is really your friend and so I think -
30:15 - because right now you know we aren't
30:17 - able to have that face to face
30:18 - interaction at career fairs or Career
30:20 - Center so I think it's super important
30:22 - to have like a list of the top people in
30:25 - your industry or even if you have a
30:26 - particular company that's maybe like
30:28 - your goal company figure out some of the
30:30 - people who work there add them or
30:31 - LinkedIn maybe even follow them on
30:33 - social media a lot of events down there
30:35 - were supposed to take place in person
30:36 - and now happening virtually and I think
30:38 - that's a benefit because now if say for
30:39 - instance it was supposed to take place
30:41 - in New York and you're not based in New
30:43 - York if it's a virtual event then you
30:44 - can attend it now and then that could be
30:46 - another way to connect with someone who
30:48 - otherwise you know you may not have been
30:49 - able to connect with unless you were in
30:51 - their city that's a great point the
30:56 - silver lining of this and some great
30:58 - resources for our viewers to check out
31:01 - Claire is one other thought yeah that
31:06 - sort of came up while I was listening to
31:08 - Courtney and I hate so I've read this in
31:11 - one of my CNN colleagues and had a piece
31:14 - in the last week or so about you know
31:17 - internship hunting right now and I hope
31:19 - this hasn't happened to anyone but one
31:21 - of the things that was suggested there
31:22 - was if your internship has been
31:24 - cancelled and
31:25 - or you know postponed or something weird
31:28 - has happened there to reach out to the
31:30 - person who you were talking with who you
31:31 - got hired by and say uh sir you know a
31:34 - lot of times companies that hire interns
31:36 - have specific projects they want interns
31:38 - to work on so so asking like is there
31:40 - any project that still needs to get done
31:42 - is there any work that still needs to
31:44 - get done that might get to a freelance
31:46 - gig or you know some sort of some sort
31:48 - of project that you could put on the
31:49 - resume
31:50 - down the line I think I just you know
31:53 - being creative in that way about you
31:56 - know it's it might be more challenging
31:58 - this summer in the coming months but who
32:01 - can you ask to get a project to get an
32:04 - informational interview it's just
32:05 - something that that you can talk about
32:07 - then later down the road you know there
32:09 - was this challenging time in my career
32:10 - but here's what I did with it that's a
32:15 - great point thank you for sharing that
32:17 - alright our last question comes from our
32:21 - former girls who could alumni team
32:23 - intern Camille Dee she asked landing a
32:28 - job or internship at a huge tech company
32:30 - is going to be more competitive than
32:32 - ever with hiring freezes offers being
32:34 - rescinded Claire as you just mentioned
32:36 - and in-person recruitment events being
32:38 - canceled how likely is it that companies
32:41 - will roll out new career opportunities
32:44 - at the end of the summer like they've
32:46 - done in the past Claire do you want to
32:50 - start sure yeah so again I think it's
32:54 - you know obviously it's such an
32:55 - uncertain and tricky time so it's kind
32:58 - of hard to know I think um again
33:00 - especially by the end of the summer
33:02 - maybe this you know this opportunity
33:04 - that we've talked about the tech
33:05 - companies really kind of jumping on this
33:08 - digital transformation the moment that
33:10 - we were seeing I think that you know
33:12 - hopefully a couple of months down the
33:13 - line those opportunities start to open
33:16 - up that companies start to you know they
33:18 - have a little bit more of a sense of at
33:20 - least where the world is going where the
33:22 - market is going that kind of thing so
33:25 - I'm hopeful that we'll see those
33:28 - opportunities start to pop up a bit more
33:31 - again I think that that you know looking
33:34 - for you know looking beyond those big
33:36 - tech companies and thinking
33:38 - you know maybe about being creative
33:40 - about the career path that you saw
33:42 - yourself taking you know maybe there's
33:44 - an opportunity to volunteer with a
33:46 - non-profit that that needs help with
33:48 - that digital transformation again I
33:51 - think like looking at freelancing
33:53 - opportunity this is like they thought I
33:56 - need in a lot of cases especially the
33:58 - big tech companies might take the
33:59 - opportunity to scoop up some talent that
34:02 - you know maybe startups are having a
34:04 - smaller harder time you know certainly
34:07 - we've seen layoffs and hiring freezes
34:08 - and so so it could also be that the big
34:11 - tech companies take the opportunity to
34:13 - hire more they have the resources to do
34:15 - that and so yeah I would say don't don't
34:18 - lose hope that's great to hear and that
34:22 - makes a lot of sense
34:23 - Courtney I love tasks as a follow-up
34:26 - question how or to what extent our
34:29 - company is proactively addressing
34:30 - diversity in their hiring particularly
34:33 - as they think about having rescinded
34:34 - offers or delaying some of their hiring
34:37 - later in the summer or a year um well I
34:42 - can really only speak to what I hope
34:43 - companies are doing because like I said
34:46 - I know this is uncertain time for
34:48 - everyone but I do hope that companies
34:50 - during this time period that are being
34:52 - mindful of especially if they did
34:54 - already have a group of interns where
34:56 - they were hoping to onboard if they did
34:58 - have to resend those offers I hope when
35:00 - they do pick back up I hope they are
35:02 - keeping in mind who they're looking to
35:04 - onboard what schools are they coming
35:06 - from so they're making sure that these
35:07 - aren't students who are coming from the
35:09 - same schools these aren't students who
35:11 - are coming from the same regions these
35:13 - are students who are racially diverse
35:14 - gender diverse I hope those are at top
35:17 - of mine when they are looking to pick
35:19 - back up with hiring I'm just kind of a
35:21 - piggyback off of Claire I do think that
35:23 - a lot of the big tech companies because
35:25 - of the money that they do have I do
35:27 - think they have more resources to pivot
35:29 - quickly and so I do hope that you know I
35:31 - won't be surprised if you know some of
35:33 - these internships may become virtual
35:36 - internships I think be open to that and
35:38 - what that will look like but I do hope
35:39 - that companies keep diversity and
35:42 - inclusion at top of mind so you can't
35:44 - just bring on diverse candidates and
35:46 - then you you know and that's done you
35:47 - have to also make sure that you have
35:49 - programs in place for them to feel
35:51 - included
35:51 - that they don't get on board and feel
35:53 - isolated so I do hope that companies
35:56 - will if they have had to put a halt on
35:57 - hiring or a halt on internships that
36:00 - when they do pick back up they will keep
36:01 - in mind who are we bringing on board
36:03 - what backgrounds are they coming from
36:05 - what schools are they coming from what
36:06 - experiences are they bringing to the
36:08 - table so that way they know that they're
36:10 - getting that best group of incoming
36:12 - talent to foster and to be the next
36:15 - generation of leaders thanks for that
36:19 - Courtney and girls could we very much
36:22 - believe in hope for that as well
36:25 - Claire are you seeing any trends when it
36:29 - comes to companies proactively
36:31 - addressing diversity and they're hiring
36:33 - right now um yeah so I think this is
36:38 - this is perhaps a little bit outside of
36:41 - my you know realm of coverage but I do
36:45 - think like Courtney said that that just
36:47 - becomes even more important as we think
36:50 - about solving new kinds of problems
36:52 - thinking about you know how different
36:55 - kinds of people interact with technology
36:56 - differently having a range of
36:59 - perspectives in your workplace and and
37:02 - making a workplace that is open to
37:05 - hearing all of those different voices
37:06 - and taking suggestions from all of those
37:09 - different voices I think that tech
37:10 - companies in particular trying to serve
