02:37 - rolling and remind us that we're all in
02:38 - this together
02:40 - um so i want to start off with a
02:42 - question that addresses a concern
02:44 - girls of girls who code college age
02:46 - alumni have mentioned many times with us
02:49 - um and we're gonna start with this
02:50 - icebreaker and then move into some
02:52 - questions y'all have submitted in
02:53 - advance
02:54 - we have great discussion questions and q
02:56 - a
02:57 - all right here's our icebreaker share a
03:01 - time
03:01 - that you had an interview that did not
03:03 - go so well this is a big one
03:05 - what did you learn from the experience
03:07 - and how you applied that knowledge in
03:09 - other future interviews in your
03:10 - professional career
03:13 - so let's start with uh margaret
03:17 - hello everybody happy to be here today
03:20 - um um that one there it
03:24 - actually shaped how i approached
03:27 - interviews in the future as well as
03:29 - how i approach uh difficult situations
03:32 - um i was on an interview one time and
03:35 - everything was going great
03:37 - at the end the interviewer asked me
03:41 - why are you leaving now you know why are
03:44 - you even considering
03:45 - leaving your job and my response was
03:49 - around the quality of the people and i
03:51 - was talking about
03:53 - my current employer in a very poor
03:56 - fashion
03:58 - and from that i knew
04:01 - based on his eye contact that that
04:04 - wasn't a good thing
04:06 - so the interview was going well and i
04:09 - said to myself you really blew it this
04:10 - time
04:12 - so what i learned from that afterwards
04:15 - and every interview that i ever went on
04:19 - i looked at the situation and every
04:21 - difficult situation i was
04:23 - in i looked at it from the standpoint of
04:26 - yeah i may be talking about the quality
04:28 - of the people
04:30 - however taking that negative and turning
04:34 - it into a positive
04:35 - and using it as an opportunity to
04:38 - develop
04:38 - other people around me yes they may not
04:41 - have the
04:42 - same skills um but at the same time
04:45 - people are diverse people bring
04:47 - different things to the table
04:49 - so as everyone here every day inclusion
04:53 - and diversity
04:54 - and when you look at inclusion and
04:56 - diversity you're looking at different
04:58 - skills
04:58 - different ways of approaching things um
05:02 - so taking that particular lesson
05:05 - i said to myself okay that's an
05:08 - opportunity to leverage different skills
05:10 - and different approaches
05:12 - in order to make the team stronger in
05:15 - order to get to
05:16 - that objective in the end but taking a
05:19 - different path
05:20 - instead of looking at it as people are
05:23 - not of the quality that
05:24 - at that time early in my career i
05:26 - thought they should be
05:28 - and then the other aspect is embracing
05:30 - that diversity
05:31 - looking at the capabilities that people
05:33 - do bring
05:35 - thanks margaret i think uh watching how
05:37 - we talk about our co-workers is a good
05:39 - lesson for everybody
05:40 - in most circumstances before i turn
05:44 - over to maggie i want to let you all
05:45 - know that we are going to have poll
05:47 - questions
05:47 - interactive questions during our event
05:49 - tonight so when that pops up on your
05:52 - screen you've got to answer quickly
05:53 - we'll capture your responses in about 30
05:55 - seconds and then we'll
05:57 - think um together about what it means
05:59 - when we get those responses back
06:01 - so while we wait for that first poll i'm
06:02 - going to turn it over to maggie oh
06:04 - it's a poll it should have popped up on
06:06 - your screen go ahead and answer and
06:08 - we'll come back to your responses
06:10 - uh in just a few moments uh maggie while
06:14 - folks fill out the poll can you tell us
06:15 - about a time
06:16 - when your interview didn't go well yes
06:19 - and first i just want to say thank you
06:21 - so much for having me
06:22 - um if you do hear some background noise
06:24 - i live in new york city and i don't have
06:26 - control of
06:27 - my heat and it is blasting in the back
06:29 - so hopefully that will go off soon but
06:31 - um first off one one time i remember i
06:35 - i showed up um in a suit
06:38 - and you know the the coordinator
06:41 - who scheduled my interview had told me
06:43 - um we're very casual
06:45 - here at up nexus which is where i had
06:47 - the interview
06:48 - so you can feel free to wear whatever
06:50 - you like but i was traveling and all i
06:52 - had was a
06:53 - full-on suit um and i felt like that
06:56 - would
06:56 - be really intense i walked into the
07:00 - office and i looked around and everyone
07:02 - was wearing jeans and hoodies and i
07:04 - felt very out of place um but luckily i
07:07 - did wear
07:08 - some nike air force one shoes with my
07:12 - suit
07:12 - and really nervous um and
07:16 - felt very out of place um during a water
07:19 - break
07:19 - i kind of went to the bathroom and
07:21 - someone complimented me on my outfit
07:23 - and you know made me realize everyone
07:26 - can dress whatever the way they would
07:28 - like
07:28 - um and so that kind of set my my nerves
07:30 - but that was a funny scenario
07:32 - and then another time um i think
07:35 - the interviews i just knew i did not do
07:38 - well in
07:38 - and kind of felt embarrassed right um
07:42 - were the times that i didn't answer
07:44 - authentically and honestly so
07:47 - of course we have all of these prep
07:49 - questions that we can think of scenarios
07:51 - for um ahead of time but um there were
07:54 - definitely some times
07:55 - right after college or during college
07:58 - where i didn't have professional
07:59 - experience to speak to
08:01 - i only had you know restaurant
08:04 - experiences that actually could answer
08:06 - the question pretty well
08:07 - instead of going in and explaining a
08:10 - true experience that i had
08:12 - personally um maybe working in the
08:14 - restaurant
08:15 - to answer the question i like
08:19 - fibbed and just used an example from
08:22 - like one of my co-workers
08:23 - um in one of the internships i had and
08:26 - it came across
08:27 - definitely inauthentic um the
08:29 - interviewer probably could tell i was
08:31 - lying or you know fabricating in some
08:34 - way
08:35 - and so with that um i kind of reflected
08:38 - on that experience and realized that
08:40 - it's okay to um to
08:44 - tell your authentic story and actually
08:46 - that comes across
08:47 - better for the interviewer even if you
08:50 - need a moment to
08:51 - to you know think and if you don't have
08:52 - a specific scenario
08:54 - that you think is the best um in reality
08:57 - if you just speak to
08:58 - to your true um honest experiences
09:01 - yeah don't fake it till you make it
09:03 - thank you ashley
09:05 - because they probably will recognize
09:08 - that
09:09 - you're faking it so yeah
09:12 - itself is what i kind of learned from
09:13 - that experience those are both great
09:16 - pieces of advice
09:17 - um the results are in from our poll
09:20 - so about 62 of our participants feel not
09:23 - really prepared so i
09:25 - what i want to emphasize here is for
09:26 - folks on the line you're not alone
09:28 - you are in the same bucket as so many
09:30 - people and about another 38
09:33 - felt somewhat prepared so nobody feels
09:35 - perfectly
09:36 - brilliantly prepared walking into these
09:38 - interviews so just know that and feel
09:40 - some solidarity with your fellow
09:42 - students here
09:43 - i'll keep mine brief but one thought i
09:45 - had is i've actually interviewed a lot
09:47 - of people as i know margaret and maggie
09:49 - have as well
09:50 - and um i was interviewing a young woman
09:52 - for
09:53 - an internship this is way back in the
09:54 - day and i live in chicago
09:56 - and uh i asked her you know why do you
09:58 - want to work at our organization
10:00 - and she said well my friend said it's
10:02 - really cool to be in chicago in the
10:03 - summer
10:05 - and i thought well what that doesn't
10:07 - answer my question that tells me why you
10:09 - want to live in chicago that doesn't
10:10 - tell me why you want to work at our
10:12 - organization and i think that points to
10:14 - another area that people struggle with
10:16 - which is really thinking about what is
10:18 - exciting to you about this opportunity
10:19 - in this company because
10:21 - bringing that enthusiasm can be a great
10:23 - starting place for any conversation
10:26 - i want to jump into some of the
10:27 - discussion questions here
10:29 - um we have students from a lot of
10:31 - different levels on the phone
10:33 - um and so we've sort of structured these
10:35 - questions to reach different audiences
10:36 - at different times
10:38 - uh so the first one is around rising
10:41 - college students folks sort of at the
10:42 - more early start of their college
10:44 - journey and we've received a lot of
10:45 - questions about the interview process
10:46 - as a whole and especially around around
10:48 - what makes interviews unique and
10:50 - different
10:51 - um this is like really uncharted
10:53 - territory for a lot of folks
10:55 - so one sort of big picture question here
10:57 - is what is the difference between a
10:58 - regular interview and a technical
11:00 - interview
11:01 - and when should candidates expect to be
11:03 - at these different stages
11:04 - in the interview process maggie do you
11:06 - want to take this one first
11:09 - yeah um so i in my experience
11:13 - both at xander and then now warner media
11:16 - we definitely start off with um
11:19 - more of a behavioral interview so most
11:22 - likely
11:22 - um at you know big time big and small
11:25 - tech companies
11:26 - um you may chat with a recruiter such as
11:28 - myself first so they're
11:30 - they're in hr so they're really just
11:31 - kind of trying to gauge
11:33 - um if it would make sense to move you
11:35 - forward and
11:36 - um those will mostly be behavioral and
11:38 - just kind of touch on a little bit of
11:40 - your
11:40 - experience so really just chatting
11:42 - through your resume most the time
11:44 - and then from there you might chat with
11:47 - um someone more technical and that would
11:50 - be
11:51 - maybe a couple more behavioral questions
11:53 - in the beginning but then
11:54 - potentially a coding test um or
11:58 - or some type of technical assessment um
12:01 - just to make sure that it would make
12:03 - sense to move forward that you kind of
12:04 - have that baseline
12:05 - tech knowledge um and then usually from
12:09 - there
12:09 - there would be more of that white
12:12 - boarding
12:13 - and um live in-person technical
12:16 - and behavioral assessments with members
12:19 - of the team that you would join
12:21 - so usually it kind of gradually goes
12:24 - from
12:25 - behavioral to tech and then a mix of the
12:28 - two and kind of
12:29 - see how you communicate while being
12:31 - technical and things like that
12:33 - um i think that answers the first bit
12:36 - but
12:37 - happy to elaborate after after margaret
12:39 - if you have some things to add
12:41 - that's a great start so just to
12:42 - summarize you usually start with that
12:44 - behavioral interview like are you a good
12:45 - fit for this company
12:47 - and if you get past that moving into
12:49 - whatever versions of technical
12:50 - interviews that company might have
12:52 - exactly great to know margaret has that
12:54 - been your experience too is there
12:55 - anything you can add
12:57 - yes that that is the same experience and
13:00 - in the beginning when the resumes come
13:02 - in
13:03 - of course we're looking for certain
13:05 - skill sets to really pop
13:07 - on that resume so when you're talking
13:09 - about
13:10 - exploring the entry level people coming
13:13 - out of college
13:14 - we're looking at what courses have you
13:16 - taken
13:17 - what are you doing on your internships
13:20 - and so forth
13:21 - so after that we we do a screening
13:24 - with that screening it's around okay
13:27 - what are your actual technology tools
13:31 - and what did you learn on your actual
13:33 - engagements as far as your
13:35 - not necessary engagements but your
13:37 - internships and what was your role
13:39 - role is very key when we actually bring
13:43 - you
13:43 - in the first interview we're not going
13:46 - to have you sit there and start
13:48 - to include coding on the board that
13:50 - that's normally not it
13:52 - we're trying to like maggie mentioned
13:54 - it's more around the behavioral
13:56 - aspects um at the same time when we
14:00 - actually take you to that next interview
14:02 - and
14:03 - we're looking at your technical skills
14:05 - we may present a case study to you
14:08 - what is very key to note it's not about
14:12 - having the best technical solution what
14:15 - it's about
14:16 - is what is your approach and what is
14:18 - your critical thinking skills
14:20 - so that's one of the key aspects that
14:23 - college students need to realize no one
14:25 - is expecting you to have
14:27 - all the answers all the time because
14:29 - throughout your entire career
14:30 - you will never have all the answers all
14:33 - the time
14:34 - so it's more about being able to
14:36 - critically
14:37 - think through the problem what is your
14:40 - approach
14:41 - and quite frankly you make it to a point
14:44 - that you don't know the answer so how do
14:46 - you get that answer
14:48 - so that's more or less what we're
14:50 - looking for within those energies
14:53 - thank you that's so informative i think
14:55 - it's really reassuring
14:57 - to hear that even folks that have been
14:58 - around the block and have interviewed
15:00 - for many jobs and interviewed many
15:01 - people
15:02 - you don't always know the answers in the
15:04 - interview in fact you may not
15:06 - may not know the answer ever and you may
15:07 - still get that job if you do a good job
15:09 - communicating your process and asking
15:11 - good questions
15:12 - exactly um thanks to you both for those
15:14 - answers
15:15 - um one thing we hear a lot about is like
15:18 - applying for your dream job or your
15:19 - dream internship
15:20 - and it's nerve-wracking and you get that
15:22 - call for your interview and you're like
15:24 - so excited you're jumping for joy you're
15:25 - telling
15:26 - your friends you're calling your family
15:28 - um and then it is just so
15:30 - scary and you have to prep for it um and
15:32 - so we're gonna
15:33 - put a poll question up for the audience
15:36 - first which is around
15:37 - what resources do you use to prepare for
15:40 - interviews
15:41 - and if you have specific resources you
15:43 - use here websites tools books please
15:45 - post them in the chat like share with
15:47 - each other
15:48 - things that you have found really
15:49 - helpful and then the question i want to
15:51 - ask
15:52 - margaret and maggie here is around the
15:55 - resources that you might recommend and
15:57 - so
15:57 - some that we've heard are leak code and
15:59 - cracking the code which are resources
16:01 - online available for students
16:03 - but i think the broader question here is
16:05 - what are your tips for preparation
16:08 - any tools or strategies you might use
16:10 - getting ready for that dream job
16:12 - interview and margaret why don't we
16:13 - start with you on this one
16:15 - sure number one within uh
16:18 - when you go to the internet there are so
16:20 - many sources out there
16:22 - it's almost to the point it's
16:23 - information overload
16:25 - some of the ones that i have seen and
16:28 - and
16:29 - pretty much i actually asked a couple of
16:31 - our employees you know
16:32 - what did you use what was relevant what
16:35 - was useful
16:36 - and they came back with freecodecamp.org
16:41 - that there it provides over 6 000
16:43 - tutorials
16:45 - it has videos articles interactive
16:48 - codings
16:49 - lessons that you can take it actually
16:51 - has study groups out there
16:53 - so the key point it's free so that's
16:56 - very key
16:57 - uh hacker blank that's another dashboard
17:01 - that you can take advantage of
17:03 - and they have various resources out
17:06 - there and interview prep kids
17:07 - tutorials and so on so the good news is
17:11 - there's a ton
17:12 - of free information so you really don't
17:15 - have an excuse in the end
17:17 - for not using them to sharpen your
17:20 - skills
17:21 - and keep in mind even after you get that
17:24 - great job
17:25 - you can still use these to continue to
17:27 - sharpen your skills
17:28 - so the and i always say the internet is
17:30 - your friend
17:32 - google it find the information out there
17:35 - and take advantage of it
17:37 - i love that um can i just repeat you
17:39 - said freecodecamp.org was there a second
17:41 - name of a website you mentioned yeah
17:44 - heck of ranking
17:51 - sure i also loved the point about study
17:53 - groups which is
17:54 - you know really important like you don't
17:56 - necessarily have to do this by yourself
17:58 - you could gather a group of friends for
17:59 - example your girls who code college loop
18:02 - or you could get a group together online
18:04 - and on zoom hold yourselves accountable
18:06 - here
18:07 - um working together to prepare um before
18:10 - we move over to maggie
18:11 - uh just so you all know it looks like
18:14 - interviews and blogs
18:15 - or excuse me interview blogs like uh
18:18 - blog posts about interviewing was the
18:20 - most popular resource people use 37
18:22 - percent of you use that
18:23 - and then next up was interactive
18:25 - websites 26
18:26 - so lots of different options there free
18:29 - is great
18:30 - love that margaret it's out there um
18:32 - maggie what can you add here
18:34 - yeah um so definitely going off the
18:38 - actually you know what i'm gonna back up
18:39 - a bit i think the one main thing that
18:41 - you
18:42 - can do for both behavioral and technical
18:44 - interview prep
18:46 - is first kind of like going in within
18:48 - yourself
18:49 - um and really doing like a little bit of
18:52 - a check
18:53 - in terms of what why you really want
18:56 - that role
18:57 - um what your career goals are um and
19:00 - just kind of tap
19:01 - into your own self-awareness really
19:03 - quick i know that's really cliche but i
19:05 - think that that is um
19:07 - really important and it'll end up going
19:08 - a long way
19:10 - now in terms of actual you know all the
19:12 - things you really need to know
19:13 - um i also think that company blogs so
19:16 - for example
19:18 - xander which is the advertising
19:20 - technology group under warner media
19:23 - they have a really robust blog where you
19:26 - can see about
19:27 - um articles that have been written from
19:29 - anyone from interns to
19:31 - senior executives and they explain lots
19:34 - of things like what their specific team
19:36 - is doing what kind of data they're doing
19:38 - what kind of processes and languages and
19:40 - systems they use
19:41 - so if you do a deep dive of like the
19:44 - tech stack of the company that you're
19:45 - interested in
19:46 - i think that that can also be really
19:48 - helpful um
19:50 - and then yeah also like reviewing old
19:52 - homeworks if you have any specific
19:54 - problems or problem sets that
19:56 - that you had worked on um in school or
19:59 - even that your friends or or family
20:00 - members you know that took
20:02 - great courses um you can access those
20:06 - and then um finally just kind of
20:09 - focusing on the three areas that i think
20:12 - a lot of tech companies um
20:13 - interview on are um which are data
20:16 - structures
20:17 - algorithms and system design so kind of
20:20 - working
20:21 - through um how you would think through
20:24 - a system design problem um
20:27 - one of the main you know aspects of of
20:30 - technical interviewing that we look at
20:33 - as margaret had kind of
20:34 - alluded to earlier is kind of just like
20:36 - how you think and how you work through a
20:38 - problem
20:39 - so just working through that and if you
20:41 - hit um
20:43 - a crossroads just not feeling
20:45 - uncomfortable to ask
20:47 - the interviewer a question or whoever
20:49 - you're prepping with
20:50 - um a question about you know what they
20:52 - would do and
20:53 - where to go from there well
20:56 - this is so much good advice i know we
20:58 - have a note taker behind the scenes
20:59 - taking notes but i want to be like
21:01 - writing all of this down right now
21:03 - i loved what you said maggie because
21:05 - data structures algorithms and system
21:07 - design like those are starting points
21:08 - you can go find
21:09 - free curriculum on those three things on
21:12 - the sites that margaret mentioned
21:13 - right like if you're like i don't know
21:15 - what that means system design
21:17 - start googling find one of your
21:18 - professors and start to ask them ask a
21:21 - friend who's a few years ahead of you
21:23 - what kinds of questions they saw in
21:25 - interviews uh this is just
21:27 - such excellent advice and maggie i want
21:30 - to
21:30 - reiterate one other thing you said there
21:32 - which is you know companies they're tech
21:34 - stacks
21:34 - those are not secret you can ask them
21:37 - what kind of technology they use
21:39 - if you were at a recruiting fair and you
21:41 - were chatting with a recruiter
21:42 - about a potential role that's a great
21:44 - question to ask them
21:46 - you could even say you know i'm
21:47 - considering these three courses next
21:49 - semester what would you recommend
21:51 - you know this stuff is not secret yeah
21:54 - um just really quickly going off of that
21:56 - the good thing about kind of how most
21:58 - processes work is that you do chat with
22:00 - a recruiter or someone more
22:01 - behaviorally focused at first so you can
22:04 - ask them you know um very
22:05 - candidly what the team that you're going
22:08 - to interview for
22:09 - or that you're interested in uses you
22:12 - know what language and systems they use
22:14 - and then kind of have a little bit of a
22:16 - you know a leg up
22:18 - before you get to the technical portions
22:20 - thank you
22:21 - this is so great um i want to move on to
22:23 - our third discussion question which is
22:25 - um
22:26 - around uh the sort of key information
22:29 - you should be highlighting and this
22:30 - comes from questions we get around like
22:32 - what should i be sharing in an interview
22:34 - should i only be talking about things
22:35 - that are on my resume should i be
22:37 - talking about projects or courses that
22:38 - i'm taking
22:40 - we know that resumes especially for
22:41 - college students should really be one
22:43 - concise page
22:45 - but what key information should people
22:47 - make sure that they get across both in
22:49 - their
22:49 - resume in that technical interview in
22:51 - particular maggie why don't you kick us
22:53 - off here
22:55 - yeah i think um all of those things you
22:57 - mentioned are definitely the most
22:59 - important
23:00 - um i think the way you lay it out if you
23:03 - put your languages and systems that
23:05 - you're most strong
23:06 - in at the very top that will definitely
23:09 - catch
23:09 - um you know the the recruiter whoever is
23:11 - reviewing your resume's eye
23:13 - very quickly and then also just don't be
23:15 - afraid to
23:16 - include projects that are completely on
23:19 - your own you know if you
23:20 - weren't um directed by either a class
23:24 - or um you know a company like an
23:26 - internship to
23:28 - to go all in on a specific project and
23:30 - it's just something you did on the side
23:31 - feel free to add that if you were
23:33 - a volunteer somewhere and you know
23:35 - offering your
23:36 - um technical knowledge for for
23:39 - free you know even that would be great
23:42 - to add and any other
23:43 - kind of extracurricular activities or um
23:47 - volunteer things that you're passionate
23:48 - about i think are important to add
23:50 - if you have the room because yes it is
23:52 - important to stay
23:54 - kind of concise and within one page if
23:56 - possible
23:58 - awesome thank you margaret what do you
24:00 - want to add there
24:02 - um one other point is highlighting
24:05 - your work experience just because you do
24:08 - not have an internship
24:09 - does not mean that it's not relevant so
24:13 - one of the key aspects is when when
24:15 - you're in school you're very busy
24:17 - but holding a job while you're in school
24:19 - shows that you can
24:21 - multitask you can handle multiple uh
24:24 - responsibilities
24:25 - and still make the grade so that speaks
24:28 - volumes uh to give you an example
24:32 - i interviewed a young lady at one of the
24:34 - conferences
24:35 - and she had never had a job
24:38 - she was a senior never had an internship
24:43 - and she had a 4.0 gpa
24:47 - another candidate they worked two jobs
24:51 - they had internships and the gpa wasn't
24:55 - as strong
24:57 - we leaned more towards that second
24:59 - candidate than that first candidate
25:01 - so job experience no matter what it is
25:05 - it's relevant
25:06 - because everybody doesn't necessarily
25:08 - have an internship
25:09 - or the ideal internship
25:12 - but at the same time some people they're
25:14 - working their way through school
25:16 - and trying to juggle it's very difficult
25:20 - so i know that person is going to work
25:22 - that much extra
25:23 - hard versus the individual with the 4-0
25:26 - and they're cracking the books
25:28 - constantly that's such a good thing
25:31 - and it comes back to the point maggie
25:32 - made up front about being authentic to
25:34 - yourself if you're someone
25:36 - that is pulling late nights at a second
25:38 - job you don't have to hide that that's
25:39 - part of your story and that's
25:40 - your accomplishment yeah and then i'll
25:43 - just add one other aspect around
25:45 - um community outreach that
25:48 - that resonates significantly and even
25:52 - when you're in
25:52 - social organizations a lot of the social
25:55 - organizations whether they're sororities
25:57 - or other types of organizations they do
26:00 - have
26:01 - a community outreach arm to it you know
26:03 - emphasize that as well
26:05 - so it's it's looking at the individual
26:09 - as a whole it's not just what type of
26:12 - coding you can do
26:13 - and it's not only the soft skills around
26:16 - leadership
26:17 - and communication it's looking at the
26:19 - overall
26:20 - individual as a whole thanks yeah such
26:23 - great advice
26:25 - um we have solicited questions from all
26:27 - of you in the audience uh
26:29 - in your registration so we got some
26:30 - questions direct from students
26:32 - and we pulled out a couple that we heard
26:34 - over and over again um and so the first
26:36 - one i want to turn to here is one of our
26:38 - students who wrote i've had a couple of
26:39 - technical interviews
26:41 - and the interviewers always seem to ask
26:42 - the similar and same types of questions
26:45 - i would love to know if there are
26:46 - standard questions or types of questions
26:48 - we can be expected
26:50 - to answer outside of what's on our
26:51 - resume and i you both mentioned things
26:54 - margaret you mentioned case studies
26:55 - we've talked a little bit about
26:56 - whiteboarding
26:57 - algorithms could you talk about some of
26:59 - the broad categories of
27:01 - types of interviews and technical
27:03 - interviews that folks might face
27:05 - uh margaret why don't you start well the
27:08 - types of
27:09 - when you say the types of interviews or
27:12 - are you
27:12 - more or less leaning towards the types
27:14 - of questions
27:16 - uh i guess types of questions if you
27:18 - think that yeah let's do types of
27:19 - questions
27:20 - if you've got some ideas on that well
27:24 - everyone knows they're going to ask you
27:25 - the technical questions everyone knows
27:27 - they're going to ask you to solve skills
27:28 - questions some of the ones that we tend
27:31 - to throw
27:32 - in and it makes people think
27:35 - why should i even hire you what are you
27:37 - bringing to the table
27:38 - that the other candidates are not
27:40 - bringing that's that's the key one
27:43 - um and then we always
27:46 - want to present our best self while
27:48 - we're on the interview
27:50 - so when they throw the question your way
27:52 - what was a challenging situation that
27:54 - you failed at
27:56 - and what did you learn from it that one
27:59 - there
27:59 - it's amazing you know how many people
28:01 - we've interviewed
28:02 - and then you get to that question
28:04 - they're doing great you get to that
28:05 - question
28:07 - and they struggle with it because we
28:09 - always want to present
28:10 - our best self so it's it's okay
28:13 - to take that less desirable situation
28:18 - turn it into a positive what did you
28:20 - learn from it
28:21 - and present it in that manner so that's
28:23 - that's one of the questions that i see
28:25 - people
28:25 - constantly um they they do struggle with
28:28 - that
28:30 - and then when they ask you the question
28:34 - of what do you know
28:35 - about my company it's amazing
28:39 - how many people cannot answer that we're
28:42 - in the age of
28:43 - it's the internet age let's go to the
28:44 - website
28:46 - you know explore their website
28:49 - what do they do and understand what do
28:51 - they do
28:52 - uh um as you can see i work at kpmg
28:56 - you see that in my background and
28:59 - the one thing that everyone always
29:01 - believes is the only thing we do is
29:03 - audit
29:05 - and that is not true so therefore i
29:08 - always
29:09 - advise the campus recruits
29:13 - just go and look at the website we do
29:16 - advisory
29:17 - we do a lot of technology work and
29:20 - we do tax and we do audit
29:23 - but we do not just do one thing so no
29:25 - matter where you go if you go to a
29:27 - google
29:28 - if it understand what google does google
29:31 - does more than the search engine that we
29:33 - see here
29:34 - google has a lot of and number two
29:37 - google's
29:37 - uh know the umbrella that google falls
29:41 - under
29:42 - understand what the company does so
29:44 - that's one of the key things
29:46 - just make sure you do your research so
29:48 - you can answer that question
29:51 - this seems to be a theme do your
29:53 - research about the tech stack do your
29:54 - research about what the company does
29:56 - these are you know these are think about
29:58 - questions in advance that you might how
30:00 - you might describe your own work
30:01 - experience
30:03 - maggie can you add anything around types
30:05 - of questions and types of interviews
30:06 - folks might face
30:09 - yeah um as i had mentioned before data
30:12 - structures
30:12 - algorithms and system design those are
30:15 - definitely the types of questions for
30:17 - technical
30:18 - interviews but behaviorally i would say
30:21 - questions that focus on cross-functional
30:24 - collaboration
30:26 - which is just a fancy word of really how
30:28 - do you
30:29 - work with others you know what is your
30:32 - style of communication
30:35 - when things go wrong how do you handle
30:37 - those when
30:38 - when working with peers and and even you
30:41 - know managers or clients
30:43 - um going more towards the client end as
30:46 - well if you have
30:47 - customers or clients that you need to
30:51 - you know adhere to customer service is
30:53 - definitely a big portion as well
30:55 - kind of um again how you communicate
30:59 - if you communicate clearly concisely
31:02 - effectively
31:04 - um and then yeah in those technical
31:06 - interviews as well
31:07 - just kind of um if there
31:10 - is a roadblock or they notice a bug or
31:13 - something like that and they ask you
31:14 - about it kind of
31:16 - be prepared to answer something that you
31:18 - may not know the answer to right away
31:21 - um that those are the main
31:24 - subject areas because all teams really
31:27 - do
31:28 - work within other teams meaning if
31:31 - you're an engineer
31:32 - you're still going to need to meet with
31:33 - the product teams
31:35 - and um and you know the marketing team
31:38 - potentially and other teams like that so
31:40 - it's like how do you collaborate
31:42 - cross-functionally with them as well
31:45 - yeah i think those are some of the main
31:47 - kind of focus areas that we have
31:49 - questions about and
31:50 - um i can't give away like specific
31:52 - questions but
31:54 - um definitely depending on the team
31:58 - the very specific team um they'll come
32:00 - up with kind of their
32:02 - own questions yeah like case studies
32:05 - um and with that you can only really
32:08 - prepare for that by
32:10 - going very into the job description
32:13 - and analyzing kind of every single bit
32:16 - of what
32:16 - that team does um and getting a really
32:19 - clear picture of that before you kind of
32:22 - go into those technical interviews i'm
32:25 - gonna go off script for a second and
32:26 - just ask a follower
32:28 - let's say you're in a technical
32:29 - interview maybe it's a white boarding
32:31 - interview or an algorithm challenge
32:33 - and you really you totally draw a blank
32:36 - like you don't know what to do next
32:38 - what would you recommend saying or doing
32:40 - in that moment
32:41 - is sitting in silence and trying to
32:43 - figure it out the right thing
32:44 - should you ask questions you know how
32:47 - would you address like
32:48 - everyone draws a blank every now and
32:49 - then even on things we know
32:51 - any ideas
32:56 - i mean i i would start by saying um a
32:58 - little bit of both so
33:00 - definitely don't be afraid of pauses um
33:03 - we've like prepped interviews at least
33:05 - in my interviewers
33:06 - in my experience to um be comfortable
33:09 - with silence
33:11 - and so you may feel uncomfortable you
33:13 - know sitting there like oh my gosh they
33:15 - need an answer right now
33:16 - um but but sit with it a minute you know
33:19 - rack your brain
33:20 - think about the different courses or
33:22 - experiences you've had
33:24 - um and then if you do need you know some
33:27 - help definitely
33:28 - ask them you can be candid and say you
33:31 - know
33:32 - i thought about this approach at first
33:34 - but it just doesn't seem like it would
33:36 - it would work
33:37 - so um what are your thoughts on that
33:40 - and and maybe do you mind giving me a
33:42 - nudge in the right direction
33:44 - and then maybe they'll just say one word
33:45 - and that word will trigger you right
33:47 - back to
33:48 - a class or a practice problem you had
33:50 - and then you'll feel confident going
33:51 - down the right
33:52 - the right path and again most of the
33:55 - time there's not necessarily
33:56 - one specific right path and they really
33:59 - are just trying to see
34:00 - how you go about um you know discussing
34:04 - and really
34:05 - digging into the question i love that
34:07 - because if you say
34:08 - here are three paths i was considering
34:10 - that tells them so much about you
34:12 - already
34:12 - that tells them what's happening in your
34:14 - brain even if it's not exactly what they
34:16 - were looking for
34:17 - margaret do you want to add anything to
34:19 - that yeah i agree with maggie
34:22 - you know flipping it back and asking the
34:25 - questions and making it more of an
34:27 - exchange
34:28 - dialogue and that way like you mentioned
34:32 - you may have three approaches
34:34 - all three may be appropriate all three
34:36 - may not be appropriate
34:38 - but the whole aspect is it's the
34:40 - fact-finding that you're going through
34:41 - and the critical thinking that's what
34:43 - they're really looking at
34:45 - it's not necessarily do i have the right
34:47 - answer and then
34:48 - if you have a story to tell along with
34:51 - it when you get to the end
34:53 - and say this situation happened to me
34:56 - once before whereas
34:58 - i didn't understand the particular topic
35:01 - so
35:02 - what i did i went and i did the research
35:05 - in order to find the answer and then
35:07 - this is the outcome and the result
35:09 - so you can you can turn it into
35:12 - a story in the end and that's what
35:14 - they're more or less looking for
35:16 - this is really great very reassuring um
35:19 - let's move on to another one of the
35:20 - submitted questions from our students um
35:22 - we've talked a little bit about this so
35:24 - maybe we can move through this one a
35:25 - little bit quickly but
35:26 - i read that to stand out in an interview
35:28 - you should mention the company's mission
35:30 - statement in your answer to show that
35:32 - you support the bigger picture
35:34 - are there any other tips that you
35:35 - suggest
35:38 - we talked about a bunch of tips but
35:40 - anything you want to add that we haven't
35:41 - covered
35:43 - um if you don't mind i can start on that
35:46 - oh please take it away
35:50 - well one of the aspects that that's an
35:53 - easy find
35:54 - um over and beyond the mission statement
35:57 - go to their website
35:58 - pull down the earnings report
36:02 - tell us earnings tell us what an
36:04 - earnings reported margaret you may not
36:06 - all know what an earnings report is
36:08 - okay every every company
36:11 - when they report their quarterly
36:13 - earnings
36:15 - they have a conference call with their
36:17 - stockholders and they have a
36:18 - presentation
36:20 - and they post that presentation to their
36:22 - website
36:24 - so how do you find it always go to the
36:26 - very bottom of the website
36:29 - and it's at the bottom it will actually
36:31 - have
36:32 - uh what let me see if i recall the words
36:35 - correctly
36:36 - um uh stockholder relations
36:40 - something like that it's on that effect
36:42 - so you go out there you pull down the
36:44 - earnest report there's a presentation
36:47 - and it will tell you the direction of
36:49 - the company it will tell you
36:50 - about the recent acquisitions and it
36:53 - will tell you
36:54 - what their strategy is pick up you don't
36:57 - have to memorize it
36:59 - but pick up a couple of key points
37:02 - and you can use that within that
37:04 - interview
37:06 - to actually show that you know over and
37:08 - beyond that you did your homework
37:10 - that you know over and beyond what's in
37:12 - that mission statement
37:13 - so that's one aspect another aspect if
37:17 - you go to the company website they
37:18 - always post their articles
37:20 - and their announcements so
37:23 - if it's a tech company you're also going
37:26 - to find
37:27 - a suite of case studies around
37:30 - their customers like okay this is the
37:32 - software i sell and this
37:34 - is how it helped whether it's um
37:37 - let's say united airlines we provided
37:39 - xyz
37:40 - to do their air traffic control systems
37:43 - and so on
37:44 - so they will have these stories
37:47 - case studies of how they have served
37:50 - their clients and how their products
37:52 - have served their clients go and read
37:54 - them
37:55 - so just pick up a couple of items that
37:59 - you can actually use
38:00 - to have an exchanging dialogue during
38:03 - your interview
38:04 - so articles announcements
38:08 - earnings report this is gold um i saw
38:11 - someone in the chat asked about private
38:12 - companies
38:13 - uh looking at their blogs or their press
38:15 - pages is a great idea
38:17 - non-profits like us girls who code we
38:19 - have an annual report at the bottom of
38:21 - our website
38:22 - if i were interviewing someone and they
38:24 - had read our annual report and asked me
38:26 - a question about it i would be
38:27 - extremely impressed let's just put it
38:30 - like that
38:31 - um maggie do you want to throw another
38:33 - tip uh this stuff is gold y'all so
38:35 - bring it i was just gonna say
38:39 - um definitely do your research on the
38:41 - mission statement and kind of company
38:43 - values and culture but
38:44 - um especially with you know remote
38:47 - uh interviews where you kind of can read
38:50 - from
38:51 - you know you know your resume or or
38:53 - online materials
38:54 - don't read word for word like your
38:57 - favorite line
38:58 - um personally i think that
39:01 - it goes a lot longer of a way if you
39:04 - pull just a couple key words and explain
39:06 - why that resonates with you
39:08 - and then maybe dig in more to the
39:10 - culture of not just their mission
39:11 - statement but are they living
39:12 - out their mission statement um you know
39:15 - look at their their ergs which are
39:17 - employee resource groups
39:19 - look at how they're representing and
39:22 - serving
39:23 - um you know underrepresented groups and
39:25 - if you
39:26 - identify in a specific group that
39:29 - interests you see if they have
39:31 - that resource or any type of engagement
39:34 - externally or internally and then maybe
39:38 - speak to that definitely just
39:39 - of course as always you know be
39:41 - authentic to your own personal
39:43 - um identities passions and um
39:46 - values that you may see in that company
39:50 - um that definitely then
39:53 - then just kind of reading oh their
39:55 - mission statement says this and that
39:56 - sounds
39:57 - nice most mission statements will sound
39:59 - pretty nice
40:02 - um this is such good advice um i want to
40:06 - do a quick lightning round we got two
40:08 - questions submitted one is a scenario
40:10 - and i think it'd be really valuable for
40:12 - everyone to
40:12 - sort of hear the scenario and hear your
40:14 - advice from both of you the scenario is
40:16 - i have an interview scheduled on monday
40:18 - the 30th
40:19 - that's around the corner i've been
40:21 - studying for a month and i understand
40:23 - the material but i can't solve the
40:24 - questions in 45 minutes
40:26 - so this person has been practicing
40:28 - they've been timing themselves
40:30 - it takes me hours i want to ask my
40:32 - recruiter to postpone it for another
40:34 - month
40:34 - is that unprofessional or disrespectful
40:37 - or is there something else that i can do
40:39 - this is a really great tough question
40:41 - what do you do if you've got this
40:42 - interview coming up
40:44 - you've been working really hard you
40:46 - don't feel quite ready
40:48 - what do you think
40:52 - anyone can go i i just would go and say
40:57 - um not to you know jump to conclusions
41:00 - but
41:01 - what would one more month um
41:04 - do for you would would you really be
41:06 - able to get it down
41:07 - from maybe you know two hours
41:11 - to 45 minutes um if you do think that
41:14 - you could you could get it closer and
41:16 - closer maybe ask for
41:18 - another week or two but i will say you
41:19 - know hiring is kind of
41:22 - um a race in terms of there's a lot of
41:25 - applicants
41:25 - and the hiring manager usually wants to
41:28 - find someone quite quickly
41:30 - um and so i would go with um just
41:34 - leaning into it and maybe ask for a
41:35 - couple more days but
41:37 - but just go with your gut and be
41:39 - confident and
41:41 - at the end of the day i've seen many
41:43 - many
41:44 - interviews occur especially entry level
41:46 - where the candidate
41:48 - can only get really halfway through the
41:50 - problem you know they don't find a
41:52 - solution
41:52 - all the way but it was still enough
41:55 - to show their thought process and their
41:58 - tech skills
41:59 - to push them around to to the next um to
42:02 - next round so
42:03 - always be confident and and um
42:06 - you know know that you've done your best
42:09 - and that
42:10 - a whole you know month could could
42:13 - really help
42:14 - margaret yeah if you're at a couple of
42:17 - hours and you're trying to get down to
42:18 - 45 minutes
42:20 - um i'm with maggie i don't think a month
42:23 - with
42:24 - help and more than likely
42:27 - the problem that they've given you it
42:30 - probably is not solvable in 45
42:33 - that's very very very tricky
42:36 - so they're so what they're
42:39 - more than likely you know we're we're
42:41 - really thinking through this now so
42:43 - we're thinking through it on the fly
42:45 - here
42:46 - so more than likely they're trying to
42:49 - see how you
42:50 - will deal with the stress and the
42:52 - pressure yeah
42:53 - that is such a good point it might be
42:56 - intentionally harder than you can solve
42:57 - right
42:58 - exactly so go and be confident and do
43:02 - your best
43:03 - if you feel as though you have done
43:05 - everything you can to do your best
43:07 - you will walk in there and you will do
43:09 - well even if you don't get it done in 45
43:12 - minutes thank you um i did just want to
43:15 - add one more thing
43:16 - if you do have um a learning disability
43:19 - though
43:20 - um or you know just know that you
43:23 - actually do
43:24 - need more time than potentially
43:27 - you know the other person um i would
43:30 - just share that information with your
43:31 - recruiter and see what they can do
43:33 - um because oftentimes i mean no all
43:36 - times there should be accommodations
43:38 - made for that
43:40 - that is such an important point just to
43:41 - reiterate that if you require
43:43 - accommodations for a learning disability
43:45 - you can ask for that of the interviewer
43:47 - in a timed interview or something like
43:48 - that that's
43:49 - really what a tip um we have one more
43:52 - level
44:00 - margaret um all right last lightning
44:02 - little question we got here in the chat
44:04 - is um someone says i'm a freshman here
44:06 - by the way
44:07 - do you still have a chance if you find
44:09 - yourself that you don't know the answer
44:11 - to a problem that they ask you if you
44:13 - just flat out don't know it do you still
44:14 - have a chance
44:15 - oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah you do
44:21 - it's back to the last question that we
44:23 - were just starting i know
44:25 - yeah yeah it's it's the same thing and
44:28 - um
44:29 - you do have a chance and it's it's back
44:32 - to the point on me
44:33 - it's not about having the best technical
44:36 - solution
44:37 - it's all about the approach
44:40 - i'm a freshman i haven't learned data
44:43 - structures yet
44:44 - unfortunately i don't know how to answer
44:46 - that
44:48 - all right we are going to start to wind
44:50 - down here um i want to add my last piece
44:53 - of advice and then i'm going to give it
44:54 - over to maggie and margaret for one last
44:56 - pro tip
44:57 - just a quick one if they've got one mine
44:59 - is you gotta send a thank you note
45:01 - i've interviewed a million people when i
45:03 - get a quick note it doesn't have to be
45:05 - three paragraphs it can be five
45:08 - sentences that say thank you so much for
45:10 - your time i really enjoyed learning
45:11 - about your organization
45:13 - you know i would value the opportunity
45:15 - to continue this conversation
45:17 - thank you so much like it shows me that
45:19 - you want this role
45:21 - it's thoughtful um and it shows that you
45:23 - kind of cross the t's and dot the eyes
45:25 - so a thank you note is my
45:26 - my final tip for the evening um margaret
45:29 - do you have a final tip you'd like to
45:30 - offer it's funny you said thank you note
45:33 - i remember one job
45:35 - i went for and instead of doing the
45:37 - email i'm not saying that you have to do
45:39 - this
45:40 - but it's just a story i actually
45:44 - typed the letter printed it out and i
45:46 - nailed it
45:47 - wow and when i went for my final
45:51 - interview
45:52 - whereas i walked in and she said oh no
45:56 - this isn't an interview i just wanted to
45:57 - see the person that actually mailed me a
45:59 - letter
46:00 - and she had it right up on her
46:03 - it was taped up to the wall she said no

46:36 - interview
46:38 - thank you those are really good words
46:40 - maggie
46:41 - last tip of the evening you should be
46:44 - a team ad not a team fit
46:48 - so do not try to mold yourself to fit in
46:52 - what you think
46:53 - that they are looking for
46:56 - they are looking for someone who will
46:58 - add value to their team
47:00 - and on the flip side make sure that
47:03 - the team you're interviewing with will
47:05 - add value in your life as well
47:08 - i will love it it's wonderful advice so
47:10 - um we are going to close out for the
