00:00 - us and to warm things up we're going to
00:03 - do
00:03 - an icebreaker and so get ready for those
00:07 - of you that are dialed in and viewing
00:10 - with us
00:11 - we are going to send you a nice
00:14 - little icebreaker question and so just
00:17 - keep alert
00:18 - because you'll have about 30 seconds to
00:21 - um to get that answered and you'll see
00:22 - it pop up on your screen
00:24 - and just respond and we'll be able to
00:27 - keep you involved in our conversation
00:29 - okay so let's start with the ice breaker
00:32 - warm up
00:33 - and our ice creaker question for our
00:35 - panelists is
00:37 - how did you secure your first internship
00:40 - or job and i'd like
00:44 - to um have keisha get us started with
00:47 - that
00:48 - sure would love to so i started
00:52 - i actually started with ge straight out
00:54 - of college
00:55 - uh so when i started with ge i
00:58 - entered into their information
01:00 - management leadership program
01:02 - but they also had an internship program
01:06 - for those that were in college at that
01:08 - time i was not aware of it
01:09 - so when i was in high school i
01:12 - proactively
01:14 - was looking for different internship
01:16 - programs
01:17 - and i connected with inroads and rose is
01:20 - a non-for-profit
01:21 - um organization that's focused mainly on
01:26 - african-americans brown
01:27 - and and uh and black students with high
01:31 - academic achievements connecting them
01:33 - with corporations so i actually did an
01:35 - internship program within rhodes
01:37 - where i interned with a telephone
01:39 - company at that time 9x
01:40 - out of new york and that helped prepared
01:43 - me for
01:44 - a career fair that i went to
01:45 - specifically where ge was there and
01:47 - allowed me to start
01:49 - the uh the leadership program with ge so
01:51 - i would say
01:52 - you know really just looking at various
01:54 - internship programs that
01:55 - most companies have like general
01:57 - electric as well as non-profit
01:59 - organizations
02:01 - that's amazing keisha and what's most
02:03 - interesting is that my first in
02:05 - internship withdrew inroads and
02:08 - uh we must have been cut from the same
02:10 - cloth because my spirit was always
02:12 - kind of look for the things that are
02:14 - going to differentiate you
02:16 - and so it helps you get that early
02:18 - access to
02:19 - a corporate environment you know really
02:22 - develop your network early on
02:24 - and um i'm just i think it was a really
02:28 - good program that's still operational
02:30 - today so
02:32 - it's so great to see both you and i now
02:33 - where we are having both started off at
02:35 - inroads
02:36 - absolutely um and so amazing
02:40 - and uh such a small world
02:43 - all right so let's check in with our
02:45 - panelists did you
02:46 - hopefully you guys got your questions
02:49 - and
02:50 - we want to pull you to see if you've
02:52 - been part of any
02:54 - virtual career fairs so many of you have
02:57 - hopefully been there so have you
02:59 - attended a virtual career fair
03:02 - for the many of you that are out there
03:04 - you should have your question up go
03:05 - ahead and
03:06 - answer yes or no
03:12 - okay
03:15 - awesome well while we have our um
03:18 - esteemed viewers answering that question
03:22 - let's go ahead and um and get some more
03:25 - panelists so
03:26 - um magalie what about you so my first
03:29 - internship was a little bit
03:31 - different i was really involved in baja
03:34 - essays so
03:35 - baja is a off-road um
03:38 - you know all-terrain vehicle right and i
03:42 - was just
03:42 - intrigued at you know how you know as a
03:45 - student right
03:46 - i could contribute to a project like
03:47 - that especially because i started as a
03:49 - freshman
03:50 - it was just you know one week you know
03:53 - right fresh in college right and i was
03:55 - exposed to the opportunity to join this
03:57 - team and i said you know why
03:58 - what why not right at the same time i
04:01 - was
04:02 - also very uh engaged with the society of
04:04 - hispanic professional engineers chip
04:07 - and they really motivated us right
04:10 - but particularly myself and really you
04:13 - know they provided
04:14 - some good resources on how to get you
04:16 - ready especially for that first job fair
04:19 - right
04:19 - um and you know just having that
04:21 - confidence and having that additional
04:23 - experience right and having some good
04:25 - examples of working with you know uh
04:28 - different teams you know working uh in
04:31 - in technology right application as well
04:34 - as you know with all the soft skills and
04:36 - the preparation from you know the
04:37 - student association
04:39 - i was able to go you know very confident
04:42 - and walk into that first job fair
04:44 - talk to a lot of recruiters right and as
04:47 - soon as i saw you know my current
04:48 - company actually gm
04:50 - i was like i need to talk to those
04:51 - recruiters right um so i had the
04:54 - opportunity to talk to a few of them
04:56 - ask questions you know i i can't prepare
04:58 - you know with
04:59 - uh already an understanding of the type
05:01 - of technology and product that they work
05:03 - on right
05:04 - uh so it was a really engaging uh you
05:06 - know conversation
05:08 - and after that you know i just went
05:10 - through the process of interviews and so
05:12 - on and i got my dream job
05:13 - so it was very very rewarding experience
05:19 - that sounds amazing um and i think that
05:23 - nowadays we have to continue to get that
05:26 - get the skills
05:27 - get that pre-work be so we can dive
05:30 - right into an environment and be ready
05:32 - to perform
05:33 - and so um really inspiring story i'm
05:35 - sure for everyone to hear
05:38 - okay so it looks like everybody showed
05:42 - up at this
05:42 - this presentation at the right time
05:44 - because 75 percent of you
05:46 - said that you have not joined a virtual
05:48 - career fair
05:50 - so um with the things that you guys are
05:52 - hearing from us so
05:53 - in terms of what types of organizations
05:55 - you should be looking at
05:57 - as well as the things you'll hear to
05:58 - learn about how to navigate will
05:59 - hopefully be very important
06:01 - for you and help you in your journey so
06:05 - now let's go over to jill
06:06 - what about you how you know what what
06:09 - did you do to secure your first
06:10 - internship
06:11 - or job
06:16 - and we may still be waiting on jill i
06:18 - mean we are
06:19 - in the beauty of technology so sometimes
06:22 - it will work sometimes it will not so
06:24 - even so jill may be on later and we can
06:27 - well let's go ahead and keep going
06:29 - so one of the things that's interesting
06:32 - in a virtual career fair so as you guys
06:34 - can see you will walk into a virtual
06:37 - environment
06:38 - and you have to show up ready right
06:41 - and you know you need to be professional
06:44 - so
06:45 - if there are video conferences you
06:47 - should dressed appropriately you should
06:49 - look appropriately
06:51 - one of the guiding principles that
06:53 - people often give
06:54 - inside of accenture is you almost have
06:56 - to elevate your energy level
06:59 - 50 percent more than what what you would
07:03 - because you're on camera right and so
07:05 - sometimes it cut even though you
07:07 - may feel like you're being energized you
07:09 - may come across as low energy
07:11 - so um so for all of our panelists we're
07:14 - going to stay high energy
07:16 - for you just like we're sitting in our
07:18 - career fair as we kind of go through the
07:19 - first set
07:20 - of our questions so a couple of things
07:24 - a number of the viewers keisha and
07:27 - magalie
07:27 - said that they have anxiety about
07:31 - career fairs especially when they've
07:34 - just entered college and have not really
07:36 - attended a career in person and you saw
07:38 - that 75
07:40 - have not been part of a career fair or a
07:42 - virtual one
07:44 - so they have questions like what do you
07:46 - wear
07:47 - should you have your resume right even a
07:49 - virtual resume on hand to upload
07:52 - and what does the format need to be and
07:54 - most important what about
07:55 - body language because when you are in a
07:58 - physical career fair
08:00 - you can read the room you can navigate
08:03 - you can do eye contact and really get a
08:06 - feel for the environment so
08:07 - how do you navigate those things in a
08:09 - virtual setting so
08:12 - the first question of tonight that we we
08:15 - want to get out there
08:16 - is what should candidates expect
08:19 - when attending a virtual career fair and
08:22 - how
08:22 - best do they right now start preparing
08:25 - for the experience
08:27 - and so keisha let's um go to you first
08:30 - yeah you know i tell all candidates
08:33 - virtual
08:34 - or in person uh you dress for the role
08:37 - uh you dress as though you're going to
08:40 - be interviewed
08:41 - uh so specifically because you're on
08:43 - camera i say be fully dressed you never
08:45 - know when you have to stand up if you're
08:48 - bending over to pick up something
08:50 - you want to make sure you are fully
08:52 - dressed for
08:53 - for that for that interview i look at a
08:55 - career for you as an interview
08:57 - um and and that's what i would tell you
08:59 - to walk in expecting
09:01 - that at any given moment that employer
09:03 - on the other side of that camera could
09:05 - actually hire you for the job and i had
09:08 - situations like that while i was in
09:10 - college it wasn't virtual but
09:12 - it was the same in which you know i came
09:15 - dressed in my blue suits
09:17 - with my white shirt underneath uh in
09:20 - preparation for an interview and i
09:22 - actually got two job offers
09:24 - uh during that time i didn't take any of
09:26 - those roles it wasn't the right fit for
09:27 - me but
09:28 - you know you have to expect that you can
09:30 - you know be hired on the spot
09:32 - uh for sure and then i would say to you
09:35 - know be prepared
09:37 - in a virtual setting um as though you
09:40 - are
09:40 - you know meeting with that person face
09:42 - to face meaning
09:44 - you know keep make sure you stay focused
09:46 - with the camera so you're in the middle
09:47 - of
09:48 - of the screen make sure that you're you
09:51 - have the right body language
09:52 - uh you constantly have a smile on your
09:54 - face uh
09:56 - it just shows that you're pleasant
09:57 - upbeat i think that's important
09:59 - as much as your true self can come
10:02 - across your true
10:03 - personality of who you are absolutely
10:05 - bring that forward
10:07 - don't suppress who you are people
10:09 - eventually will see that
10:10 - can see if you're uh putting on a front
10:13 - or
10:14 - a falsehood of any nature so you know be
10:17 - your authentic self
10:18 - come true to who you are um as you are
10:20 - meeting someone virtually
10:22 - uh for sure and then i would say to
10:25 - uh understand who's on the other side of
10:28 - the camera right so
10:30 - in those virtual settings you're
10:31 - typically going to get one person at a
10:33 - time or one person
10:34 - in a square so get a good feeling of
10:36 - who's on the other side of the camera
10:38 - where they're located
10:39 - um how they represent the company in
10:41 - terms of their title and the role that
10:43 - they play
10:44 - in the organization as much as you're
10:46 - prepared with understanding
10:48 - who the interviewers are and who the the
10:50 - companies are on the other side i think
10:52 - that would help you as well
10:54 - that's really good advice and i think
10:58 - that at the end of the day this is you
11:00 - have one shot
11:02 - right and um even if it's a virtual shot
11:05 - you have to make it count
11:06 - and so that you would normally do
11:09 - that inroads helped us do um we we take
11:12 - those same steps
11:13 - right as we're entering into this fair
11:16 - and it's funny i can see some of the
11:17 - questions um
11:18 - popping up about at least my virtual
11:21 - background
11:22 - and it's funny because um it's not fake
11:25 - and it is a um a jpeg file
11:28 - right that you can just add into zoom
11:31 - and so i just wanted to bring up a point
11:33 - that
11:33 - if you are at home where you cannot
11:37 - be in a professional space it's a
11:41 - perfect opportunity
11:42 - to differentiate yourself right to find
11:44 - a background on the internet that's an
11:46 - office space that um is a nice
11:49 - professional bookcase or
11:50 - you know home office atmosphere and it
11:53 - will just help you
11:54 - you know stand out and keep the
11:57 - professional appearance alongside of
11:58 - everything else that you're doing so
11:59 - keep those comments going though it's
12:01 - really good to see
12:02 - and and we can respond to those things
12:04 - as well
12:06 - so magalie what about you what what um
12:09 - do you want to share with our audience
12:11 - about preparing for a virtual career
12:14 - fair what can they expect when they walk
12:15 - in the room
12:16 - what's going to be significantly
12:18 - different from a physical fare
12:20 - no that's that's that's great and you
12:22 - know great insight from you
12:24 - to you know keisha and tracy um
12:27 - so i want to talk more about you know
12:29 - when you're actually
12:30 - there ready to click that link right and
12:32 - and and
12:33 - join the conversation right so um many
12:36 - universities and many companies may
12:39 - utilize
12:39 - different systems right and platforms so
12:42 - some things may be applicable some
12:43 - things may be a little bit different
12:45 - from you know one session to the other
12:47 - but what's most important is you know
12:49 - once you click in
12:50 - you're gonna find you know a variety of
12:53 - rooms or different companies right
12:55 - with links that you can click access
12:58 - right
12:59 - sometimes you may be greeted by just one
13:02 - recruiter right that is completely
13:03 - dedicated to you but sometimes you
13:06 - may be expect to join a conversation
13:08 - that is already happening right
13:10 - um so um with that in mind uh something
13:13 - that i
13:13 - always you know advise and encourage you
13:16 - know all of the candidates to have ready
13:18 - is
13:19 - a good elevator pitch right and and now
13:22 - more important than ever right because
13:24 - we're trying to you know to
13:26 - create that first impression virtually
13:28 - right
13:29 - um and to me a good um you know elevator
13:32 - pitch
13:33 - includes you know who i am what
13:36 - what i'm doing right um and then um

13:43 - so with that you know i'm ali soto arsen

13:49 - motors and let's say that at that time
13:51 - i'm looking for leadership roles in
13:53 - an area with controls integration within
13:55 - your company right
13:57 - another thing that um i'm also you know
14:00 - and and something that i cannot stress
14:02 - enough you know you don't have to go
14:03 - into creating something that is very
14:05 - long you know
14:06 - just you know keep it simple right um
14:08 - and just you know if you have a
14:10 - recruiter that greets you you know be
14:12 - prompt
14:13 - you know be confident right and engage
14:15 - in good conversation
14:16 - from there the conversation takes over
14:18 - right
14:20 - and you know come prepare with you know
14:22 - some questions regarding the company
14:25 - some good things that you can ask is
14:27 - about the company vision
14:28 - the mission the values the technology
14:31 - the products
14:32 - and even in this unprecedented times
14:34 - sometimes it's good to ask
14:35 - uh you know about you know the company's
14:37 - response to the you know present
14:39 - situation about covet right
14:41 - and the involvement with the community
14:43 - so just you know
14:44 - questions that will help you understand
14:47 - you know how
14:48 - your skill set and experience aligns to
14:51 - to to the company but at the same time
14:53 - you know
14:54 - will you be a good cultural fit right

14:58 - and you know the conversation and the
15:00 - networking opportunities you know that
15:02 - you create
15:03 - um you know as part of participating in
15:06 - events like this
15:07 - can really you know continue throughout
15:09 - the years right and
15:11 - and i can tell you that i just crossed
15:12 - you know uh
15:14 - conversations in in an event at the
15:17 - university
15:18 - with you know people that i talk to them
15:20 - as recruiters now
15:21 - and here i am you know representing
15:24 - general motors right

15:40 - the opportunity for you to get to know
15:42 - the type of opportunities that they you
15:44 - know
15:44 - are offering and learn more about what
15:47 - they do
15:48 - so yep that's fantastic advice
15:52 - okay so now that we know a little bit
15:53 - about the virtual career fair format
15:57 - we know that that unlike a physical fair
16:00 - attendees just have a finite amount of
16:02 - time right to get in
16:04 - get the information talk with a
16:06 - recruiter
16:07 - and then make an impression so um
16:11 - for viewers this is the time to really
16:12 - listen in to what keisha and magali are
16:14 - going to share about
16:16 - the hiring process right and what
16:18 - companies are looking for when they have
16:20 - that
16:21 - five minutes with you so um
16:24 - you know one of the things that i always
16:26 - struggled with when i was walking into a
16:28 - physical career fair was
16:30 - what what am i gonna say so to your
16:32 - point cause you're about elevator pitch
16:34 - you know what am i gonna say what two
16:36 - questions can i ask
16:38 - right and then how do i get the
16:40 - information i need to make
16:41 - sure that that company is a fit for me
16:44 - and that i'm a fit for the company
16:46 - right so that's the kind of prep that
16:49 - that you should be doing when whether
16:50 - you're in a virtual or a physical
16:52 - environment
16:53 - so we're going to get the audience
16:55 - involved again and do another polling
16:57 - question
16:59 - so for our viewers i want you to respond
17:02 - to
17:03 - whether you've ever prepared a list of
17:06 - questions
17:06 - to ask potential employers so give us a
17:10 - sense of
17:11 - whether you've done that or not
17:17 - so take a second to fill out that poll
17:19 - for us
17:24 - awesome and then while the poll
17:28 - is uh is going on ladies i will
17:31 - get your expertise on a different area
17:35 - so what questions
17:39 - should job seekers ask to help them
17:42 - stand out
17:43 - so again as they're doing that prep that
17:45 - one or two
17:46 - questions that they have to get out in
17:47 - that five minutes
17:49 - what questions should they steer to
17:52 - and then what questions are taboo that
17:55 - you really don't want to ask
17:57 - so um magali maybe we start with you um
18:00 - this time
18:00 - um share share your wisdom on this area
18:03 - for us
18:04 - sure so questions to ask to
18:07 - stand out uh will be you know just going
18:09 - back to what i've been mentioning about
18:11 - you know
18:12 - making your research questions that you
18:15 - first and foremost
18:16 - feel comfortable right because the
18:17 - recruiter may come back with another
18:19 - question right why are you asking about
18:21 - this
18:22 - or you know why why are you so
18:24 - interested in this topic so

18:42 - or a very unique skill set um you know
18:45 - questions that are related to that
18:47 - that will give you the opportunity to
18:49 - you know for you to continue the
18:50 - conversation
18:51 - oh yes i'm familiar with that technology
18:54 - um because you know i have the
18:55 - opportunity to implement it or yes i
18:57 - know that language right because it's
18:59 - something that i use in a day-to-day
19:01 - basis
19:01 - in order to solve problems right so
19:04 - those will be the things that you know i
19:06 - highly encourage you you know to engage
19:08 - in conversation because you know
19:09 - the conversation keeps rolling and
19:11 - that's exactly what you want to do right
19:13 - or you're talking to a recruiter things
19:16 - to not
19:16 - ask you know as part of that you know
19:19 - first impression
19:21 - i will say salary and salary is one that
19:24 - you know we understand you know that
19:26 - this opportunity
19:27 - you know you're interested not only
19:28 - because of the experience that you're
19:30 - gonna gain
19:31 - but also you know let's be realistic
19:33 - right in this day and age these
19:34 - opportunities come with a salary that
19:36 - help
19:37 - you know the students you know
19:38 - throughout their um you know education
19:40 - right
19:41 - um but for this is not exactly the the
19:44 - best time to talk about that right
19:46 - please consider that you know um if you
19:49 - you know if the recruiter
19:50 - believes that you're a good fit for the
19:52 - company there's going to be many steps
19:54 - that you will have to follow whether
19:56 - those are you know some
19:57 - additional screening by other members of
20:00 - the company
20:01 - along with interviews right and you will
20:03 - have more than plenty of opportunity to
20:05 - talk about those things
20:08 - that's great advice so hopefully
20:10 - everybody's taking notes that is
20:12 - um those are some important things to
20:13 - consider what do you think keisha
20:16 - yeah i'll add to that i'll say that in
20:19 - addition you know
20:20 - always make sure you're asking questions
20:22 - around professional development
20:24 - you're coming new into an organization
20:27 - you always want to
20:28 - understand how can you grow how can you
20:31 - be able to
20:32 - to manage your career throughout this
20:35 - organization and this company so
20:37 - really getting a feel for you know what
20:39 - professional development
20:40 - what career paths exist today
20:44 - um it just gives you a sense as hey can
20:47 - you fit in
20:48 - does this have a path that you're
20:49 - comfortable with i would say some
20:51 - questions to avoid is
20:52 - absolutely compensation and benefit
20:56 - questions stay far far away from you
20:58 - know do they have tuition reimbursement
21:01 - you know would they allow you to go back
21:02 - to school you want to stay far away from
21:04 - that
21:05 - you absolutely want to keep your com
21:07 - your questions
21:08 - tied to really direct around the culture
21:12 - of the business
21:13 - uh specific to you know growth
21:15 - opportunity
21:17 - uh really tied to where the company's
21:19 - going to say hey
21:21 - do you believe in their vision do you
21:22 - believe in a growth strategy
21:24 - i think that's important to understand
21:26 - coming in but i think
21:28 - the development just just really focused
21:30 - on hey you're not where you
21:31 - exactly see yourself going you have
21:33 - aspiration to grow in your career you
21:36 - want to be with a company
21:37 - that's really focused on helping to grow
21:39 - and nurture their employees so as much
21:41 - as you can pull that out of an
21:43 - interview i think that that's the best
21:45 - focus
21:47 - that is awesome advice kisha thank you
21:49 - for sharing that
21:51 - and it looks like jill is joining us uh
21:53 - via the phone we pulled her in
21:57 - you've heard the question but we're
21:58 - talking about the questions you should
22:00 - ask
22:00 - and the questions you shouldn't ask when
22:03 - you have that
22:04 - that coveted five minutes with a
22:05 - recruiter on a virtual career fair
22:07 - any wisdom to
22:11 - i appreciate share patience as i try to
22:13 - get in um it's
22:14 - you know unprecedented times right now
22:18 - in this virtual channel and we're all
22:19 - dealing with technology challenges so
22:21 - um real life right now um in terms
22:34 - the obvious questions about the company
22:36 - the opportunity would have
22:37 - but really trying to focus on tying it
22:40 - into
22:40 - um asking about the company's culture
22:43 - asking about specific
22:45 - opportunities and how they relate to
22:47 - your interest
22:48 - um trying to make it as personal
22:51 - personable as possible
23:04 - that's that's awesome and i think jill
23:06 - you touched on an important point
23:08 - um definitely steer away from the
23:10 - obvious
23:11 - and then you know to add on to this
23:13 - quickly because we're unprecedented
23:16 - times
23:17 - companies are looking for people that
23:20 - are creative
23:20 - that are agile that are flexible right
23:23 - willing to do
23:24 - kind of whatever it takes and so framing
23:27 - questions
23:28 - to give insight into that part of your
23:31 - personality or that
23:32 - how that matches with that company's
23:35 - core values or the things that they're
23:36 - focused on doing
23:38 - over the next five to ten years um are
23:40 - also good kind of thought-provoking
23:42 - ways to to bring about a question that
23:45 - helps you bring about a good impression
23:47 - right to those recruiters so thanks joe
23:50 - and so since we have you we'll have you
23:52 - tap into the next question to give you
23:54 - some more air time so we not only have
23:57 - students that are entry level or coming
24:00 - out of college but we sometimes get
24:02 - students who
24:03 - are at the experience level so whether
24:04 - they're in a graduate school or they've
24:06 - got five years under their belt
24:09 - and so virtual career fairs can be a
24:11 - really good opportunity to learn about
24:13 - the skills for certain roles and the
24:16 - skills that are transferable
24:17 - right so one of the questions i want to
24:20 - get your insight on is
24:22 - what type of technical and non-technical
24:25 - skills
24:27 - should recent graduates highlight during
24:29 - conversations
24:30 - to compete with those experienced
24:33 - candidates that are
24:34 - showing up for the same type of job
24:37 - so um so again you know we we've got
24:39 - people with maybe five ten years of
24:41 - experience
24:42 - competing for jobs with people that may
24:45 - just be coming out of school so what
24:46 - type of technical non-technical skills
24:49 - will help
24:50 - our candidates out of college stand out
24:53 - yeah i mean right now
24:59 - on is um rapidly um
25:02 - the area that we focused just six months
25:04 - ago it's very different and right now
25:06 - we're really looking for a lot of
25:07 - companies are really
25:08 - focusing on individuals who can show
25:10 - that they have transformation skills
25:12 - that they're agile
25:14 - that they are creative and they work
25:16 - differently
25:17 - and you can show that in terms of how
25:19 - you leverage technology with platforms
25:21 - and what
25:22 - different skills you leverage but also
25:24 - in terms of just general business skills
25:27 - um it's
25:30 - the skills that are valued right now are
25:33 - are very different and it's a unique
25:35 - opportunity for us to showcase how we
25:37 - are being innovative how we're very
25:39 - transformative how we're disrupting and
25:41 - taking advantage of the time right now
25:42 - to
25:44 - demonstrate new things right now love
25:46 - that wisdom so for those of you that are
25:49 - on the the call and had was unable to
25:52 - hear jill she gave
25:53 - some very good wisdom on transformation
25:56 - skills
25:57 - innovation general business skills i
26:00 - mean we all have done things
26:01 - over the summer or you know within your
26:03 - your families that kind of bring about
26:06 - just general business acumen and then
26:08 - digital like everything is digital
26:11 - right so um so those are some good tips
26:13 - anything else keisha you want to add on
26:15 - to that
26:16 - that may be differentiators yeah i would
26:18 - say you know in this
26:20 - fast moving environment as much as you
26:22 - can share
26:23 - your ability to adapt to change and
26:26 - being very adaptable
26:28 - and flexible i think a lot of companies
26:32 - are looking
26:32 - for individuals that can move in a very
26:35 - fast-paced environment
26:37 - that can shift and be able to pivot um
26:40 - and change directions where they feel is
26:42 - needed i think as much as you can be
26:44 - able to demonstrate that in your
26:46 - communication skills
26:47 - um during those types of interviews i
26:49 - think that that kind of helps you
26:50 - you know stand above the rest for sure
26:54 - beautiful okay and so for our viewers
26:56 - thank you for filling out that poll
26:58 - question so
26:59 - it looks like 65 percent of you are type
27:01 - a you prepare the questions ahead of
27:03 - time so
27:04 - hopefully this segment has given you a
27:06 - chance to maybe put
27:08 - some things on your list and then take
27:10 - some things off your list
27:12 - that you normally would go into the
27:14 - career fair to do
27:16 - so now i want to take us into a really
27:20 - exciting q a and you know there were
27:23 - lots of you that
27:24 - that had questions and so we want to
27:27 - honor that
27:27 - by being able to answer them kind of
27:30 - live on the call so
27:32 - the first question that came up
27:35 - was as follows as an international
27:37 - student
27:39 - i'm concerned that it'll be harder to
27:42 - land an
27:43 - internship or job when i graduate
27:46 - because of the unemployment rate and of
27:48 - course the
27:49 - current political climate does it make
27:51 - sense for me
27:52 - to attend a virtual career fair and if
27:55 - so
27:56 - should i disclose that i need a visa
28:00 - during my conversations and so
28:03 - um i think that that's a very important
28:06 - question
28:07 - and of course with the political climate
28:09 - this is a hot topic
28:11 - so magali what what advice would you
28:13 - give to this international student on
28:15 - how to approach
28:16 - that no thank you and actually you know
28:18 - because i
28:19 - i managed you know uh the rotational
28:22 - program as well as the internship
28:24 - program for engineering in gm i get this
28:26 - question a lot of times in linking so uh
28:30 - any of you that would like to connect
28:31 - there feel free to find me
28:34 - but um yes uh my recommendation is to
28:37 - still participate
28:38 - you know there are many many many
28:41 - companies that will be there
28:42 - and you know different companies have
28:44 - different requirements as well
28:46 - even functions in the same company from
28:49 - one organization to the other may have
28:51 - different requirements
28:52 - so yes please participate you know do
28:55 - engage in those opportunities
28:57 - even if that company that you really
28:59 - want to work for
29:00 - doesn't have the opportunity now but you
29:02 - have the opportunity to network with a
29:04 - recruiter
29:04 - it can be a connection that can help you
29:06 - you know tremendously in the future if
29:08 - the opportunity do arise
29:11 - now um as part of that research very
29:13 - important piece of you know
29:15 - all of this process right some of the
29:17 - requisitions already
29:18 - include you know and those are the job
29:20 - postings in the career
29:22 - careers website already includes some
29:24 - language regarding that
29:26 - um but you know my to me integrity you
29:29 - know
29:29 - is number one behavior right and yeah
29:33 - and that's also you know what i'm
29:34 - expecting of the candidates right so you
29:36 - know as you're part of those
29:38 - conversations you know
29:39 - ask right if there's the opportunity uh
29:42 - or the different opportunities that your
29:44 - interests that do allow for students
29:47 - that still require sponsorship
29:49 - and you may be surprised you know there
29:51 - are companies there that you know do
29:53 - offer those opportunities
29:56 - agree and um transparency trust
30:00 - honesty you know those are things that
30:02 - are are
30:03 - deal breakers right out of the gate if
30:05 - um you're not
30:06 - upfront and honest um so thank you for
30:09 - um
30:10 - for sharing that perspective because
30:11 - it's important and i love your point
30:13 - around
30:14 - check the job description up front
30:16 - because it may
30:17 - give you those details without you even
30:19 - having to ask the question so keep
30:22 - in on this conversation too yeah i'll
30:24 - add one more thing
30:26 - i would say too to recognize that many
30:28 - of our companies are global
30:30 - right so even if you know total
30:33 - transparency you you are very clear up
30:35 - front in terms of what your mobility
30:38 - looks like recognize that if that job
30:40 - may not be the right job that these
30:42 - companies are extremely global and they
30:44 - may be an opportunity even in
30:46 - your current location and i think too
30:48 - given our
30:49 - current covet situation coming out of
30:52 - covet a lot of companies are
30:54 - understanding that employees can be even
30:56 - more productive
30:57 - working from home so not being able to
31:00 - be physically at a location is no longer
31:03 - a hinder or barrier in terms of being
31:05 - able to work in in many institutions
31:07 - these days and for many roles right so
31:10 - just keep that in mind
31:11 - and be very open to that at any given
31:14 - time
31:16 - awesome and joe feel free to
31:19 - jump into the conversation because i
31:21 - mean obviously
31:22 - h1b l1s like
31:25 - you know those are just hot topics and
31:27 - some company sponsors or some don't
31:29 - right so i can i feel for the person to
31:31 - ask this question because
31:33 - it's you know it's really do i show up
31:36 - and how competitive is it really
31:38 - you know so maybe you can give some
31:40 - wisdom um
31:41 - on one encouragement to show up and what
31:44 - that competition is really like
32:08 - i have seen too many instances where
32:10 - students haven't disposed it
32:12 - and you know they get an offer at the
32:14 - end of their college years or
32:16 - their junior year of college a year
32:17 - later when they're ready to start
32:19 - two days before they're ready to start
32:21 - all of a sudden they're no longer
32:22 - um the information comes out and
32:26 - they've wasted that time
32:38 - yeah and and that's an important point
32:40 - right because at the
32:42 - end of the day companies companies talk
32:46 - right and you want to kind of keep
32:48 - putting your foot forward because even
32:50 - if it's not
32:50 - a fit for this year it may be a fit for
32:52 - next year and so remember at the
32:54 - beginning we talked about first
32:55 - impression as your best impression
32:57 - first impression is your most important
33:00 - that transparency is key
33:02 - and then the second thing i would just
33:03 - add is a virtual career fair
33:06 - is an opera a great opportunity for you
33:09 - to spend your time
33:10 - so versus having to get in a car drive
33:13 - park you know you know go to a big
33:16 - ballroom right where you're spending
33:17 - five hours
33:19 - you have a chance to just log into your
33:20 - computer pop on and learn about
33:22 - different companies
33:23 - which may help you target where
33:25 - eventually you want to to be
33:27 - right so my my spirit is why not join
33:31 - and get all the information you can and
33:34 - then also
33:34 - ask those companies what programs they
33:37 - have in place
33:38 - to help with work payment permits visa
33:40 - and h1b
33:41 - sponsorships so much easier that's at
33:44 - least
33:44 - a benefit of cobit right much easier to
33:46 - do things virtually than physically
33:48 - and a good use of time
33:51 - so uh so hopefully that was helpful uh
33:53 - for for h1bs and we're all ex
33:56 - kind of experts in this area so if you
33:58 - want some additional follow-up we'd be
34:00 - happy to to talk with you
34:02 - offline as well so let's go to our the
34:06 - second question that
34:07 - we we heard from our audience members
34:10 - so it's really good one how
34:14 - should we manage our time in the fair
34:17 - should we wait to speak with companies
34:19 - that have roles that interest
34:21 - us most should we speak with multiple
34:23 - companies to explore
34:25 - or speak to companies that have shown
34:27 - interest in the past
34:29 - so this is really getting back to that i
34:31 - really have 10 minutes
34:33 - right to do my thing while i'm in the
34:35 - fair how do i balance my time and make
34:37 - the best use of it
34:38 - so keisha what are your thoughts on that
34:41 - i say be very targeted
34:42 - um especially if you have a clear
34:44 - understanding
34:45 - of where you want to go what company you
34:49 - want to be a part of
34:50 - and what job you want to do right i
34:53 - think if you have a very clear
34:54 - understanding be very targeted and where
34:57 - you want to spend your time so it's the
34:58 - most meaningful for you you get the most
35:00 - out of it as well as you'll be able to
35:02 - provide
35:03 - better insights to to the interviewer on
35:05 - the other side of the table right so
35:07 - on the other side of the camera for sure
35:09 - so i think be very targeted be very
35:12 - very prescriptive and where you want to
35:14 - spend your time now if you're very
35:16 - unclear on
35:17 - where you want to go what role you want
35:20 - if you want to stay very technical
35:22 - if you want to be kind of more closer to
35:24 - the business side of the house and i
35:26 - think then be a little bit more broad
35:28 - right really get an understanding for
35:30 - what's out there
35:31 - what companies are doing today what
35:33 - roles are available
35:35 - what direction they're heading but it's
35:36 - more of an information gathering for you
35:38 - um so that you can better help you know
35:41 - structure
35:42 - kind of what you're thinking about next
35:43 - right so i think it really just depends
35:45 - on the individual i don't think there's
35:47 - one that's better than the other
35:48 - it's really what you're trying to gain
35:50 - out of the experience
35:52 - as well as what what you want to put
35:54 - forth in front of uh in front of these
35:56 - individuals
35:58 - thank you wise and
36:01 - moggly what do you what do you have
36:02 - after that so
36:04 - my own experience what i used to do i
36:07 - used to have a lace you know because you
36:09 - can you know
36:10 - through your you know uh educational
36:13 - institution right your university or the
36:15 - high school
36:16 - you know they are able to provide you
36:18 - know what are the
36:19 - the least of the companies that are
36:20 - participating i used to divide the list
36:22 - in three buckets
36:24 - the ones that i know and those are my
36:26 - dream companies
36:27 - right and then the ones that are very
36:29 - close to that and then the ones that i'm
36:31 - just curious about right
36:33 - so i will prioritize those that i know
36:35 - that i
36:36 - that that i'm really you know looking
36:38 - for that opportunity to happen and then
36:40 - go
36:40 - down the list right and that's the best
36:42 - way that i was able to manage the time
36:44 - right
36:45 - because in reality is you know there's a
36:47 - limit of time you know we would love to
36:49 - stay there talking to all of you as long
36:51 - as we will like write but the reality is
36:54 - that
36:54 - you know we have we want to provide an
36:56 - uh a fair
36:58 - you know opportunity to all of the
36:59 - candidates that are there right
37:01 - uh so um you know just um
37:04 - come prepared you know like we have been
37:06 - mentioning you know and
37:08 - and and ask questions also be
37:10 - open-minded
37:11 - um something that particularly another
37:13 - experience from gm
37:15 - itself right a lot of of students
37:18 - especially in the uh
37:19 - electrical software you know coding side
37:23 - they don't know that they can actually
37:24 - work on the product side right and it's
37:26 - not until they talk to the recruiters
37:28 - they talk to the company representatives
37:30 - that are there
37:31 - that they have the opportunity to learn
37:33 - about all of the technology
37:34 - transformation that is happening in the
37:36 - company right in terms of you know
37:38 - autonomous vehicles mobility
37:41 - connectivity
37:42 - that go far beyond just making you know
37:45 - cars which is what you know pretty much
37:48 - everybody knows general motors for so
37:50 - you know it is a great opportunity to
37:52 - engage in that type of conversation and
37:54 - really learn what other opportunities
37:56 - are out there that perhaps you don't
37:57 - even know about so
37:59 - yeah great opportunity awesome i like
38:02 - the list
38:02 - right this is the the b list the c list
38:06 - the other piece of wisdom i guess we'll
38:08 - put out there i mean and so you there
38:10 - are lots of virtual career fair
38:12 - platforms
38:13 - you know some there's virtual career
38:15 - days i think there's v
38:16 - fairs some companies like amazon have
38:20 - developed their own
38:21 - you know interface when you enter the
38:24 - job fair you
38:25 - actually sometimes have an opportunity
38:28 - to schedule your interview
38:29 - because remember instead of standing in
38:31 - line you actually schedule to have a
38:33 - chat with somebody
38:34 - so if you're if you have your a list up
38:37 - you know go
38:38 - and schedule those chats first right and
38:40 - then
38:41 - prioritize the rest but the the wisdom
38:44 - pieces
38:45 - don't over tax yourself right because
38:49 - you know just think about the companies
38:51 - the companies are probably talking to
38:53 - 50 to 100 plus people in a fair
38:57 - and so you want to save your energy your
39:00 - questions
39:01 - for those that you really want to go
39:03 - after hard so
39:04 - in terms of prioritization just keep
39:06 - that in mind like again it's not it's
39:08 - not a standing in line thing but a
39:10 - getting in line thing
39:11 - and using your calendaring to make sure
39:14 - that you
39:15 - um get the prioritization right
39:18 - jill did you have anything else to add
39:20 - around how to spend the time in the
39:27 - say fair um take advantage of as much
39:30 - time
39:30 - as available you know to really get to
39:33 - know other companies
39:34 - not you don't know about opportunities
39:40 - and i really liked your comment about
39:43 - not over taxing though your schedule
39:45 - um building time um assuming that some
39:48 - of your
39:49 - conversations are gonna run long um so
39:52 - that you're not running from
39:54 - recruiter to
40:04 - that's the perfect if you take nothing
40:06 - away from the career fair champ chat
40:08 - we've had today
40:09 - having meaningful conversations
40:12 - is most important right it's quality
40:15 - over quantity
40:16 - and so that kind of brings us into
40:19 - another great question which is how do
40:22 - you keep the conversation
40:24 - going after the fair is done without
40:27 - feeling like you're overly intrusive so
40:30 - this is an
40:31 - important this is like a dance right you
40:33 - want to be seen
40:35 - but but not be seen in a way that it it
40:37 - impedes upon your ability to get hired
40:40 - so keisha what what do you have for our
40:42 - audience members on how
40:43 - after the failure is over how do you
40:45 - stay connected
40:47 - so you know i i always say is
40:56 - especially during the time that you're
40:57 - in the
41:00 - virtual affair is make sure the
41:01 - individual's name you write their name
41:03 - down
41:03 - um sometimes uh most companies are
41:05 - likely to give you an email address
41:07 - for you to continue to follow up with
41:09 - them but take advantage of the network
41:11 - that we have out there which is linkedin
41:13 - and you go out and you connect with them
41:15 - on linkedin
41:16 - uh it'll be top of mind they would have
41:18 - known they would have just spoken to
41:20 - you in that college fair um and would be
41:22 - able to
41:23 - to accept the uh the invite right so
41:25 - take advantage of
41:26 - the social media platform that we have
41:28 - that helps you to maintain those
41:30 - relationships and
41:31 - and make sure you connect with them on
41:33 - linkedin and then don't you know
41:35 - you know sometimes you set up you you go
41:37 - and you connect on linkedin and then it
41:39 - becomes almost like you're
41:40 - you're constantly pinging and stalking
41:42 - and connecting with that individual
41:44 - you know i think just you know sharing
41:46 - the fact that you met them during this
41:48 - college fear
41:48 - and specifically a nugget that you took
41:51 - from the conversation
41:52 - that would kind of resonate with that
41:54 - person as we mentioned earlier they
41:56 - would have talked to 50 people that day
41:58 - right so what is that one thing that you
42:00 - can kind of bring up from the
42:01 - conversation
42:02 - that they will remember that will keep
42:04 - your name and
42:06 - your image top of mind to that
42:07 - individual for sure so i would encourage
42:10 - using you know our social media site for
42:12 - professional networks which is linkedin
42:14 - that's that's awesome yep and linkedin
42:16 - is it's great
42:17 - right and allows you to track the whole
42:19 - conversation and
42:20 - and stay in touch michaeli what's your
42:24 - best tip for it you know ge and i know
42:27 - someone
42:28 - typed what is what is general motors
42:30 - actually so
42:31 - gm is general motors for those who were
42:33 - wondering
42:35 - as a professional at general motors what
42:37 - is a candidate going to do to stand out
42:39 - with you after the fair
42:40 - what would they do to keep your
42:42 - attention yep perfect
42:43 - let me let me give you an example that
42:45 - just happened this week
42:46 - so um i was um you know
42:50 - facilitating uh a couple of um
42:53 - virtual you know webinar seminars right
42:56 - and uh
42:57 - it one of them was a student guide to
42:59 - virtual recruiting
43:00 - um and you know just sharing some tips
43:03 - and things to do right and i actually
43:06 - had uh
43:06 - one and this is just resonating to you
43:08 - know what keisha just shared
43:11 - one of the students actually reached out
43:12 - to me you know with uh through linking
43:15 - with
43:15 - um the um you know the request you know
43:19 - to add to the network and in his
43:20 - uh message he said uh you know
43:25 - um so and so we met here right he
43:27 - provided all of those details
43:28 - and he said one of the tips that you
43:31 - mentioned
43:32 - you know i will have never thought about
43:34 - that and it was just
43:35 - you know um to set up your voicemail
43:38 - right
43:39 - because if you're participating in that
43:41 - virtual career fair
43:42 - right or whatever the interaction that
43:45 - happens you know with those recruiters
43:47 - um you know it is very important that
43:49 - they have a way
43:50 - and the means to leave you you know a
43:51 - message if they cannot contact you
43:54 - so he put that as part of you know his
43:56 - message to me and i can tell you i will
43:58 - never forget that name
44:00 - because it was something that connected
44:01 - to me you know and also
44:03 - you know that uh him sharing how
44:07 - beneficial even though it was just that
44:09 - you know
44:10 - small tip that small advice right is
44:13 - something that will always make me
44:14 - remember his name
44:15 - right so little things like that you
44:17 - know
44:18 - just make sure that you know they are
44:20 - unique uh but
44:22 - they also you know uh highlight uh part
44:25 - of the conversation that you have with
44:26 - the recruiter
44:28 - and i think that's such an important
44:29 - point because remember you're virtual
44:32 - and so you know you you now have a
44:34 - chance to have a piece of paper and just
44:35 - write it down
44:36 - right so as you're talking to someone
44:39 - and you're making a connection
44:41 - you know whether it's the school that
44:42 - maybe you guys went to together
44:44 - an organization you're passionate about
44:46 - an area where you've given back
44:48 - those are great connectors when you're
44:51 - reaching back out in linkedin or an
44:53 - email
44:53 - so that that person remembers you right
44:56 - so um so remember to do that
44:57 - be very proactive and um it's not
45:01 - i mean it's about creating human
45:03 - connection right so um
45:05 - i i think that's an excellent point jill
45:08 - what about you
45:16 - something from your conversation um
45:19 - and really yes so they're
45:22 - you're standing out from one of the
45:24 - countless people they met during that
45:26 - um i'd say it's also important to
45:27 - connect with them as soon as possible
45:29 - after the event
45:30 - um memories are short um and
45:33 - sometimes you know somebody waits a
45:36 - couple of days at that point
45:37 - a lot of times um i know both for
45:41 - virtual conferences as well as
45:42 - personal conferences the people who
45:44 - stand out for people
45:46 - almost immediately and they build in
45:48 - time into their schedule
45:49 - during the day so they can actually
45:51 - reach out to people saying hey i had a
45:53 - great conversation we talked about xyz i
45:55 - would love to talk to you harder about
45:56 - abc
