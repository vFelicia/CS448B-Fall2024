00:18 - haven't been sleeping as well as I would
00:21 - like to and I'm a big advocate for sleep
00:23 - we can talk more about that the
00:26 - importance of sleep but I am also a
00:28 - student of hope and the power of the
00:32 - hope of hope the healing power of hope
00:34 - you mentioned that I was breast cancer
00:37 - survivor so you know that's something
00:39 - that that I discovered during my
00:41 - treatment for for cancer the power of
00:44 - hope and so you know I think it's a it's
00:47 - an interesting emotion because sometimes
00:49 - it laid dormant until we really need it
00:52 - but it's so powerful when when we do
00:55 - find hope and that's going to leads me
00:59 - into the next question which is you know
01:05 - what has been a career or personal
01:07 - moment of yours that required the most
01:10 - amount of bravery I think for some of us
01:12 - we thought we experience it all until
01:14 - the past couple of months you know
01:18 - someone once said to me you won't you
01:20 - almost get to really know yourself when
01:22 - you're actually in the valley and I
01:24 - think so many of us are in the valley
01:26 - right now um so if you could share kind
01:29 - of again a personal moment of yours that
01:31 - require the most amount of bravery and
01:33 - how it turned out that would be great
01:34 - and viewers get ready to answer your
01:37 - icebreaker question with the poll
01:39 - features this is gonna be the first poll
01:42 - question of the evening so stay alert
01:43 - because you got 30 seconds to respond
01:45 - after that box pops up so join us and
01:47 - share your answer yeah I don't mind
01:51 - brush my going first I so my I think my
01:55 - most brave moment happened for me
01:58 - probably about five years ago and so I
02:01 - will just share with most of you because
02:04 - similar to you I'm a technologist at
02:06 - heart and with training you know my
02:09 - undergrad is computer science and I have
02:11 - an MBA from Kellogg but really I I
02:14 - really enjoy solving business problems
02:16 - using technology and innovation and
02:19 - right when I hit a stride in my career
02:22 - in 2015 I really felt like my career I
02:26 - had become a stalemate right like that
02:28 - I'd stopped growing so I did something I
02:32 - was truly uncomfortable with which is to
02:34 - take a big risk in talking with one of
02:38 - my sponsors and advocates they told me
02:40 - you know I needed to leave an area that
02:42 - I was very comfortable in learn
02:44 - something brand new and really get out
02:47 - there and offer and for those of you
02:52 - that are used to operating in your
02:54 - comfort zone
02:55 - not only this time has probably shook in
02:57 - you to your core but when you're in your
02:58 - company you will have moments that will
03:00 - shake you to your core and this was one
03:03 - of those moments for me where I took a
03:04 - calculated risk to move out of IT into
03:08 - our business operations I had to learn
03:10 - HR from scratch and I really fell in
03:13 - love with it and ended up doing
03:16 - something amazing for myself in this
03:19 - space and so um I I think the one phrase
03:23 - that I'll kind of share is that through
03:25 - fear comes courage mm-hmm
03:28 - I love that and I wanted to share this
03:31 - kind of corporate message with you
03:33 - because you'll find yourself in lots of
03:36 - situations like that where through fear
03:39 - you can get courage and courage will be
03:41 - the thing that really helps you
03:43 - transcend into new areas that's powerful
03:48 - thank you for sharing that Tracy yeah
03:51 - yes sir I do
03:53 - yeah the moment for me was about six
03:55 - years ago and I have been at Deloitte
03:58 - for 21 years in various roles and this
04:03 - moment that that I'm getting ready to
04:05 - describe is what actually led me to my
04:07 - role as chief all being officer and so
04:09 - about 60 years ago I found myself
04:12 - completely burned out I woke up one
04:15 - morning I could open my eyes but I
04:18 - really couldn't actually kind of even
04:20 - get out of bed and engage in life and
04:22 - work in any meaningful way and so I was
04:27 - forced to take time off because I
04:30 - because I had to for my own health and
04:32 - at my own physical and mental health and
04:36 - in doing that and kind of coming back
04:38 - from turn burnout and defining what
04:42 - well-being meant in my life defining
04:44 - what boundaries meant in my life
04:45 - and really looking at what I wanted to
04:48 - do and who I wanted to be as opposed to
04:51 - just kind of going from one thing to the
04:53 - next to the next you know I had always
04:55 - um I'd been successful because I always
04:59 - prided myself on you know being the
05:01 - hardest worker working the longest hours
05:04 - and you know letting my work speak for
05:07 - itself and that was what would get me
05:09 - the next role or the next promotion
05:11 - without really being intentional about
05:13 - what I wanted to do and you know what
05:16 - was important to me in my life and
05:18 - clearly I ended up burned out so I don't
05:21 - recommend that as your strategy but you
05:25 - know coming back from burnout I became
05:27 - very passionate about the topic of
05:29 - holistic health and well-being and
05:31 - really wanted to share what I had
05:33 - learned with others so that they didn't
05:36 - you know they didn't end up where I
05:37 - ended up and I was going to resign from
05:40 - Deloitte and I went to talk to my leader
05:43 - and mentor who is still a dear friend
05:45 - and tell her that this is what I wanted
05:48 - to do this is what I wanted to focus on
05:50 - and you know and that that I was going
05:53 - to you know resign from her and she said
05:55 - to her and she said if you need this you
05:59 - know why doesn't everybody else need it
06:01 - so go back and you know put together a
06:03 - business case and so that's what I did
06:05 - if it together in this case for why
06:07 - well-being matters and why we needed a
06:08 - role and in programs and tools and
06:11 - resources for our people and I called up
06:15 - other leaders and you know ask them to
06:18 - give me a chance and let me try this but
06:20 - I really believed in it and if it didn't
06:22 - work that I would leave the firm and so
06:25 - there is no risk to them and that was
06:27 - about five and a half years ago and I'm
06:29 - still at Deloitte and it's still going
06:31 - strong so it has worked out well so far
06:35 - but it was you know really brave moments
06:37 - to say hey I'm gonna I'm gonna dive in
06:39 - and try something that I really believe
06:41 - in and if it doesn't work out I believe
06:44 - in it so much that I'm willing to leave
06:46 - and go make it you know make it work
06:48 - somewhere else that's powerful well
06:51 - thank you so much for sharing I know
06:53 - we've done a poll to see where people
06:57 - are at
06:58 - um and well how many people said it was
07:02 - their professional life versus their
07:03 - personal life so I'm looking to see um
07:07 - what viewers have to say um in the
07:12 - meantime you know I think if I had to
07:15 - answer um I don't even know what I would
07:18 - say I feel like it's both right it's
07:20 - almost like at times for me I would
07:22 - think that I feel like me you know we
07:26 - both about all what both of you talked
07:29 - about it's almost like your body tells
07:30 - you that you gotta rest like your body
07:33 - tells you that it's enough like your
07:35 - body tells you to make this professional
07:38 - change and that's certainly what
07:40 - happened to me at 33 when I was in this
07:43 - job that I didn't want to be in in the
07:45 - life that I felt like I was stuck and
07:47 - that was that was really a change for me
07:50 - to start kind of living my life more
07:52 - bravely and you know taking the rest
07:55 - because you can never be brave if you're
07:56 - tired and you know I mean doing the
07:58 - things that I needed but that we needed
08:00 - to do to basically take care of
08:01 - ourselves
08:02 - um I am still looking for the answers I
08:07 - know it just popped up okay yeah yeah so
08:13 - 84% said their personal life and 16%
08:17 - said their professional experience which
08:20 - makes sense because you know we're
08:22 - talking to like I just said like I got
08:24 - my mind made my bravery in my
08:26 - professional experience when I was 33
08:28 - years old when I ran for office and up
08:30 - until then it was like moments in my
08:32 - personal life and I'm sure for both of
08:34 - you or you were to really push yourself
08:36 - thank you guys and thank you for the for
08:40 - our participants for participating in
08:41 - the poll before we dive into
08:45 - conversation I want to let folks know
08:47 - that today is going to flow a little
08:48 - differently than it has in the past
08:50 - three sessions we had almost 500 of you
08:54 - submit questions around ways to maintain
08:56 - your mental health
08:57 - well just incredible during this time
09:01 - and it was really eye-opening for a lot
09:03 - of us who were able to kind of see your
09:05 - questions and I'm not going to say that
09:06 - I didn't get emotional a lot for that
09:10 - reason I really
09:12 - to make sure that girls are protein
09:13 - wanted to make sure that we took this
09:14 - entire session to answer your questions
09:17 - and to focus on many themes that we saw
09:19 - being repeated over and over again I
09:21 - want everyone to know that girls our
09:23 - code would respect everybody's privacy
09:25 - and we will not be sheets of sharing who
09:28 - submitted questions but we want to thank
09:30 - all of you for your thoughtfulness and
09:32 - for being motivated to help heal the
09:34 - world not to put any pressure on you but
09:37 - it is on you right now to save us and to
09:40 - save this country because we have given
09:42 - you a broken broken nation that I know
09:46 - that you will help fix and part of
09:50 - getting you there is to make sure that
09:51 - your mental health is in check and
09:55 - hopefully this conversation will help
09:56 - you on that journey I want to move
09:59 - tonight into into tonight's discussion
10:02 - and I do again want to say one more time
10:05 - I want to thank you guys for your
10:08 - honesty and for your candor and for your
10:10 - rawness and for your authenticity
10:12 - there's a lot of emotion in these
10:14 - questions and I know it takes a lot of
10:16 - courage to submit them so again from
10:19 - behalf of all three of us Tracie
10:21 - Jennifer and I we want to say thank you
10:23 - so the first questions we're going to
10:26 - talk about are some of the coab and
10:28 - related questions you know in the media
10:31 - we're hearing conflicting information
10:32 - about what's happening you know some
10:35 - states have lifted their or stay-at-home
10:37 - orders others are saying the numbers of
10:39 - cases are going up some people are
10:41 - saying in the number of cases are going
10:42 - down I mean I have two young children I
10:45 - do not know what I should be doing at
10:47 - this moment at all and I'm sure all of
10:49 - us feel that way so I can't imagine what
10:52 - some of the folks on this call of you
10:55 - feel because you're depending on leaders
10:56 - to give you answers and they're not
10:58 - right now and it's very confusing so you
11:03 - know the first set of questions kind of
11:04 - going to address how Buuren affected and
11:07 - the ways to manage your health and
11:09 - wellness at this time so I want to start
11:12 - with question one here we go
11:15 - I feel blessed to have been offered a
11:17 - virtual internship but I am struggling
11:19 - with anxiety depression and being
11:22 - productive when feels like life has just
11:25 - and then exploded I want to show up as
11:29 - my best self this summer but feel that
11:31 - if I share this with my internship
11:33 - manager my offer will be rescinded do
11:36 - companies support interns and employees
11:39 - who suffer from mental health conditions
11:41 - or do they fire them Jennifer can we
11:44 - start with you yeah absolutely and so to
11:49 - start and companies absolutely support
11:53 - employees that struggle with a mental
11:56 - health condition as a matter of fact it
11:59 - you cannot be fired based on you know
12:02 - this simple fact that you you struggle
12:05 - with your mental health or you are
12:06 - diagnosed with mental illness and it's
12:08 - actually not even something that you are
12:10 - required to disclose in any way shape or
12:15 - form to to your employer unless you
12:18 - choose to and if you choose to it cannot
12:21 - be held against you grounds for firing
12:25 - you know that would be solely based on
12:28 - performance or some other reason why you
12:33 - would need to get me or separated from
12:35 - the organization but it would not be
12:36 - based on the fact that you struggle with
12:40 - your mental health or you were diagnosed
12:41 - with a mental illness and I think I'm
12:44 - starting there because I think that
12:45 - that's really really important for
12:47 - people to know and to understand the
12:50 - laws that are actually associated with
12:53 - that and but beyond that you know and
12:57 - within Deloitte and my role at Deloitte
13:00 - so first of all I am I struggle with
13:04 - anxiety I've lived with anxiety for many
13:06 - years and we prior to coltd and I'm very
13:11 - open about it I've actually been
13:13 - published and has a Business Review
13:14 - talking about my my struggles with
13:18 - mental illness and what organizations
13:21 - and leaders can do to support their
13:23 - employees and so at Deloitte we have a
13:25 - lot of programs a lot of tools and
13:27 - resources or a program called mental
13:29 - health at work we deliver mental health
13:31 - first aid training so that everybody
13:33 - understands what mental health and
13:36 - mental illness is and how they can
13:37 - support one another
13:39 - have compassionate conversations with
13:40 - one another about their mental health
13:43 - but I would say also to whomever
13:46 - submitted this question and just anybody
13:49 - the feeling heightens levels of anxiety
13:51 - depression worry whatever it is you're
13:55 - feeling right now first of all like know
13:57 - that it's totally normal
14:00 - every single person on the planet is
14:03 - having their mental health impacted
14:06 - right now and if they're not I want to
14:07 - talk to them and study them because the
14:10 - rest of us have something to learn and
14:13 - so I think that that's really important
14:15 - just to know that it's okay not to be
14:17 - okay all the time and give yourself some
14:20 - grace some compassion some self empathy
14:23 - and if you do need help you know reach
14:25 - out and get the help you need whether
14:27 - that's you through a friend family you
14:30 - know in the community or you know
14:32 - through through your employer but do not
14:34 - you know do not let it fit persist do
14:37 - not struggle alone you don't have to and
14:39 - it is absolutely nothing to be ashamed
14:42 - as we really need to do everything we
14:44 - can to to normalize the conversation
14:47 - around mental health in much in the same
14:50 - way we do as our physical home Thank You
14:54 - Jennifer I appreciate you saying that it
14:56 - sure there's a study out I think 86% of
14:58 - people right now are experiencing
15:00 - anxiety depression from some mental
15:03 - health issues yeah yes you're not alone
15:05 - you know it's literally you're not alone
15:08 - yeah I think that that was before it was
15:10 - one in one in five I would struggle with
15:13 - their mental health and in a year and
15:16 - now it's four and five given coated and
15:19 - then all of the racial injustice so it's
15:21 - it's literally all of us yeah it's all
15:24 - of us um Tracy I am I just want it first
15:29 - of all I'm just so humbled by that
15:31 - question because it just shows how
15:32 - courageous right you are you all to just
15:36 - ask for something that's that's gonna
15:38 - help you and I just want to start by
15:42 - saying you have to be willing to give
15:43 - yourself some grace between kovat and
15:46 - the systemic racism and inequality
15:49 - that's literally on the display for the
15:51 - world to see we're living in
15:54 - unprecedented times we aren't we
15:58 - navigating normally would be would be
16:00 - interesting navigating through this is a
16:02 - new reality and so there's a couple of
16:06 - things I want to share first your
16:07 - question around how can you set yourself
16:10 - up for success right with your virtual
16:12 - internship I want to encourage you to
16:15 - advocate for yourself you you really
16:18 - should speak to your internship manager
16:21 - and understand what's expected of you
16:23 - also what you really need to be
16:26 - successful you know as you head into the
16:28 - summer and so try to think about ways
16:31 - that you could balance you know your
16:33 - work commitments with things that you
16:35 - need to do to just get personal relief
16:38 - from stress and use it as a time to
16:41 - advocate and negotiate the schedule that
16:43 - works for you so this is a time for
16:46 - self-advocacy and it's a time that
16:48 - everyone would understand and you don't
16:50 - have to feel like you're alone secondly
16:53 - I think you know Jennifer hit it right
16:55 - on the head it's not acceptable to
16:59 - discriminate against anyone with a
17:01 - mental illness in corporate America in
17:03 - the nonprofit space we all don't believe
17:09 - in that and we have built a structure to
17:10 - support you and so at Accenture we have
17:14 - this philosophy and I'm sure you've
17:16 - heard of it right about truly human we
17:20 - we believe that people bring their whole
17:24 - self to work which means your mind your
17:26 - body your heart your soul right your
17:28 - your all of that you your mental
17:30 - well-being is as important as your
17:32 - physical well-being and so there are
17:35 - lots of things that we have tried to put
17:38 - in place to help others and I'm sure
17:39 - other companies have have done the same
17:41 - so we we do have an Employee Assistance
17:45 - Program so it's for interns as well as
17:48 - employees and it's confidential right
17:50 - you can call 24 by 7 and get the
17:52 - resources you need everything from face
17:54 - to face or virtual consultants with a
17:56 - zero tolerance right against any type of
17:59 - retaliation and there's mental health
18:04 - employee resource groups so you you
18:06 - there are communities of people you know
18:08 - that will wrap their arms around you
18:10 - that are also feeling this so that you
18:13 - have a comfortable space to be able to
18:15 - talk through issues so as you're going
18:17 - into your companies kind of seek out
18:19 - those gr G's and use it as a place to
18:22 - really share and feel comfortable and
18:24 - then there are you know lots of mental
18:27 - health allies like we we have about 600
18:29 - people across our company who you know
18:31 - through a peg or a phone call as an ally
18:33 - but you can reach out to you and get
18:35 - help and so I just I really encourage
18:38 - you as you start your internships to to
18:41 - seek out the things that are there for
18:43 - you and know that you're not alone and
18:45 - it's okay not to be okay I love that
18:48 - phrase and we for sure need to honor
18:51 - that today I think this next question
18:57 - goes nice into where you as sort of what
18:59 - are some record recommendations for
19:01 - prioritizing mental health and self-care
19:03 - while struggling with technology fits
19:05 - fatigue and getting used to the new
19:07 - normal working from home so the two
19:10 - things I do is I turn off video I know
19:12 - in my video but like you know a very
19:14 - wise engineer told me that the reason
19:16 - why we're so exhausted after video is
19:18 - because of the delay time right between
19:19 - when somebody's actually talking things
19:21 - your brain is actually doing more work
19:23 - than if you were just on the phone so in
19:26 - the beginning we all wanted to see each
19:27 - other now I'm like I just want my leg it
19:29 - was Danity backs I'm free on video
19:32 - the second thing for me is I've tried to
19:34 - maintain my routine so I like to I
19:37 - workout and you know at 7:30 in the
19:39 - morning even though the baby's waking up
19:41 - and the dog wants to go out I just I'm
19:43 - out the door and I'm running and so
19:44 - doing doing something that has that I do
19:47 - at a time it's inconvenient for
19:50 - everybody else is the key because it's
19:52 - made me keep prioritizing myself
19:54 - so those are the two things I've been
19:56 - love to hear what you guys are doing for
20:00 - me I agree it's really been about
20:02 - setting a routine because just to give
20:04 - context
20:05 - prior to kovat I spent a lot of time on
20:07 - the road so I you know is in I'm in
20:09 - multiple countries several times a month
20:13 - and it's it's been different being
20:15 - physically in front of a computer all
20:17 - day every day I have as you saw to two
20:20 - young daughters who were homeschooling
20:22 - and a husband who's a lawyer that's on
20:24 - calls ten hours a day as well and it's
20:27 - it becomes difficult to separate kind of
20:29 - work from family right and you also
20:31 - separate you being on versus off and so
20:35 - one of the things that I did was really
20:37 - set a routine where you know I agree to
20:39 - kind of work 9:00 to 4:00 and at 4:00 I
20:42 - turn everything off we go for a walk as
20:45 - a family we've actually discovered the
20:47 - park across the street that we really
20:49 - never had time to visit and we sit out
20:51 - there and read and just enjoy each other
20:53 - and you have to kind of put those
20:56 - boundaries in place for yourself so that
20:59 - you can physically turn off the other
21:01 - thing that I'm really passionate about
21:03 - asleep you know sleep is an essential
21:06 - part of recovery that your brain your
21:09 - body needs to be able to to be at its
21:11 - best every day and so a lot of people
21:13 - don't realize that not getting enough
21:16 - sleep is is just detrimental to your
21:19 - overall health and so I although I fail
21:22 - at it most times I try to get at least
21:25 - eight hours my downside is seven hours
21:28 - but I don't really go past that because
21:30 - it's so critical and then I would say
21:34 - the third thing is and hopefully this
21:36 - will help you is practicing an attitude
21:39 - of gratitude particularly right now as I
21:44 - start to think about you know other
21:46 - people's situations what's going on
21:48 - broader in the world
21:49 - I truly appreciate one having a job
21:52 - being able to contribute and being able
21:55 - to help others and that has been
21:57 - uplifting for me there's actually a
21:59 - great book that I'll see if I can
22:01 - quickly find the link it's called the
22:02 - book of joy it's co-written by the Dalai
22:05 - Lama and Desmond Tutu and it really gets
22:08 - to the simple things in life that we
22:12 - should we should appreciate right and
22:14 - sometimes that gets us out of our focus
22:16 - on just getting deliverables done and
22:18 - checking off the checklist and really
22:20 - enjoying life for what it is and so
22:23 - that's been also helpful for me
22:26 - thank you that's a wisdom they're
22:30 - permitted Jennifer would you share yeah
22:35 - absolutely and I think some of mine will
22:38 - be repetitive and but certainly is like
22:41 - I call them my self-care non-negotiables
22:43 - and they involve eating
22:49 - sleeping moving is myself similar to to
22:52 - the two of you and and you know in terms
22:55 - of technology and you know I put I put
22:58 - my technology to work for me and so if
23:00 - you look at my calendar it has time in
23:03 - my calendar for breakfast lunch dinner
23:06 - movement and bedtime and those are
23:11 - blocks in my calendar and I stick to
23:13 - them just like any other meeting or
23:15 - actually the most important meetings at
23:17 - a point but I have and that doesn't mean
23:19 - that I can't be flexible and they don't
23:21 - move around here and they're a little
23:23 - bit but it means that if it's in my
23:25 - calendar and you know it's I will stick
23:28 - to it and then it's important and that I
23:30 - don't let you I I hold my boundaries and
23:33 - the other important thing is is you know
23:37 - communicating what your boundaries are
23:38 - and what your needs are to others
23:40 - whether they're in your home whether you
23:42 - work with them on you and creating that
23:45 - that culture and authenticity and trust
23:48 - and letting people know what you need
23:50 - and asking them what they need you know
23:52 - in you know supporting one another and
23:55 - so if I've found that to be really
23:58 - powerful I think you power over routine
24:00 - routine is so important right now to
24:03 - help us and maintain some sense of
24:05 - normalcy those of you you know echoed
24:08 - that so I think you know all of those
24:11 - things are important and then one final
24:14 - strategy that I will share I mentioned
24:16 - before that you know I live with anxiety
24:19 - and struggle with anxiety and prior to
24:21 - kovat I used to wake up in the morning
24:24 - and do a little gratitude journal or
24:26 - write five things that I was grateful
24:28 - for and with all of the anxiety that
24:31 - I've been having to connect of it and
24:33 - said I switch to my gratitude list too
24:36 - and out of my control list and so I wake
24:39 - up in the morning and I write down all
24:41 - the things that I'm worried about that
24:43 - are completely out of my control that I
24:44 - can do nothing about and just getting
24:47 - them out getting them on paper and then
24:49 - moving on with my day but also a couple
24:52 - times a week and you know it's in the
24:54 - beginning I did it every day I have a
24:56 - 20-minute worry appointment my calendar
24:58 - and for 20 minutes I fit and worry about
25:00 - all the things that are on
25:02 - out of my control list and it honestly
25:04 - has become like torture like by the time
25:07 - the 20 minutes is up I'm so tired of
25:10 - worrying you know that you know I put it
25:12 - down and if those worries come up again
25:14 - later on when I'm trying to engage with
25:16 - my husband or my family or if I'm trying
25:19 - to sleep because that's one of the times
25:21 - when my worries seem to creep in I just
25:23 - remind myself that I have a worry
25:25 - appointment tomorrow and that I can get
25:26 - to those worries then and they'll be
25:28 - plenty of time and space for them and
25:29 - that's been a strategy that's been
25:31 - really really helpful for me during this
25:32 - time Thank You Jennifer so our last
25:38 - question for this segment is just
25:41 - starting out in the workforce it's
25:42 - exhausting straddling the line of
25:45 - expressing our thoughts to make an
25:46 - impact being unprofessional and being
25:49 - successful
25:50 - how have you identified reasonable goals
25:53 - stay productive juggled work-life
25:56 - balance and ferment to burnout
25:58 - throughout your career whoo Jennifer do
26:04 - you want to start yeah so a great
26:09 - question and I think based on and my
26:12 - introductory comments clearly and I did
26:16 - not survive I didn't avoid this burnout
26:18 - and and so it was not something that I
26:23 - did really well in my early days and I
26:28 - think many of the things that we have
26:30 - already been talking about are really
26:32 - really relevant but you know getting
26:34 - clear with yourself by using finding
26:39 - finding strong mentors creating a
26:42 - community for yourself of people that
26:46 - will talk through your goals and your
26:50 - problems and you know help you you know
26:54 - find a path forward is really really
26:57 - important and I mean it's people that
27:00 - you know from all walks of life you know
27:04 - different ages different races so you
27:07 - make sure that you're you're getting all
27:09 - kinds of different points of view I
27:11 - found that to be just really really
27:13 - valuable to me in my life and you want
27:15 - people in your
27:16 - that aren't just yes people that aren't
27:18 - going to just say oh yeah that's a great
27:20 - idea every time you you know you you
27:23 - bring them an idea or you discuss
27:25 - something with them you want people that
27:26 - actually are going to say hey you know
27:28 - maybe that's not such a good idea right
27:30 - now or I don't see you you're loving
27:32 - that or maybe you have you know too much
27:35 - help scoring your plate right now and
27:37 - you know you can hold off on that for
27:39 - for for the time being and so I call it
27:42 - my own personal board of directors and I
27:44 - and I think that that's something that
27:46 - has been really powerful for me post
27:49 - burnout and you know just just put the
27:53 - whole conversation around boundaries
27:55 - that we have I mean eight you know
27:57 - boundaries doesn't mean always saying no
28:00 - I think boundaries get a bad rap because
28:02 - boundaries just you know sound rough and
28:05 - tough and but I've always been
28:07 - fascinated by the fact that you know we
28:09 - we we have you we have boundaries for
28:12 - our home you know we we lock our homes
28:15 - to make sure that that people don't come
28:18 - in we lock our cars but we don't pet
28:20 - Balinese for our own personal health and
28:22 - well-being or we have a hard time doing
28:24 - that right and so we protect our we
28:26 - protect our things but we don't protect
28:28 - ourselves and I think you know when you
28:31 - when you put when you put it in those
28:33 - words that you're kind of like oh yeah
28:35 - you know I really need to have these
28:36 - boundaries and so boundaries aren't
28:38 - always about saying no but sometimes
28:40 - it's about saying no not right now or no
28:44 - how can I engage in a different way or
28:46 - no how can I find someone else to help
28:48 - you and I think that that's a really
28:52 - important skill for everybody to learn
28:55 - because early in my career I said yes to
28:58 - everything and it doesn't work and it
29:00 - doesn't get you to where you want to go
29:03 - all the time right I mean just saying
29:05 - yes does not does not get you you know
29:08 - to to your endgame a lot of times it
29:10 - takes you off track no traces you're
29:12 - going to add a floor in the next segment
29:14 - yeah I think you know I did just one
29:17 - quick thing so I really feel strongly
29:20 - about this area and I know why you're
29:22 - you're asking the question and I'll just
29:25 - share something personal no one will
29:28 - really remember
29:29 - that I was a managing director in
29:32 - Accenture what they will remember is how
29:34 - many people that I helped how many walls
29:37 - did I take down really what how did I
29:39 - Drive some systemic change and the way
29:42 - to be purposeful is to not take on too
29:46 - much and so I will just share a personal
29:48 - strategy that I have I really have come
29:51 - up with three things that are important
29:53 - for me the first one is I want to be
29:57 - present with my family my second one is
30:00 - I want to be an authentic leader right
30:02 - my I want to live my core values through
30:05 - my leadership my third one is I want to
30:07 - make an impact in my community and so
30:09 - what I do is as opportunities come up as
30:13 - people you know bet for my time I
30:16 - compare that to my three right and if
30:20 - they're not part of my three I use my
30:23 - voice to say no right and so so using
30:27 - your voice to say no gives you the space
30:30 - to truly live a life that's purposeful
30:33 - and impactful and so just keep that in
30:37 - mind it it's it's worked for me for the
30:39 - last twenty years and I truly feel that
30:41 - you know I'm gonna be able to create the
30:43 - legacy that I'm looking for I love that
30:47 - it's very clear Thank You Tracy now we
30:52 - want to move towards another set of
30:54 - questions that's gonna address the
30:57 - injustice against black and minority
30:59 - communities and again these questions
31:02 - were incredibly thought-provoking they
31:04 - were raw they were honest people shared
31:07 - their fears and their thoughts and again
31:10 - I want to thank everybody all the folks
31:13 - that are on this call for doing that I
31:15 - know it's hard and as Tracy said so many
31:19 - of you are just we're exhausted and so
31:22 - taking the time to write those questions
31:24 - I am expressing gratitude and I'm on
31:26 - behalf of all of us for that before we
31:30 - get begin I'd like to pull the audience
31:32 - and ask how are you feeling at this time
31:37 - so while people are answering this
31:43 - question it has been I'm not feeling
31:48 - great not to date myself but you know I
31:53 - remember Rodney King you know I was out
31:57 - on the streets when Trayvon Martin died
31:59 - and Eric Gardner and whether I was
32:03 - organizing your protest or marching in a
32:05 - protest I feel like my son Shawn grew up
32:08 - making protest signs you know asking for
32:11 - people to be able to breathe asking for
32:13 - our black brothers and sisters to be was
32:14 - free and so to watch but we watched and
32:23 - mr. Floyd's murder was was just you
32:26 - can't unsee that and to see how many of
32:31 - our our black brothers and sisters and
32:34 - how much of a toll it's taking on them
32:37 - is hard and and painful and so I've been
32:42 - doing the work and of course as always I
32:46 - always see girls we are an organization
32:48 - that's fighting structural racism
32:50 - everyday and so we have been double
32:53 - downing on on our girls we've been
32:58 - having really powerful conversations
33:00 - with our staff last week was really
33:04 - emotionally hard because we had a lot of
33:06 - hard conversations I thought I spent the
33:08 - entire week just crying with them I like
33:11 - all the leadership lessons of like not
33:12 - crying with your team we're just like
33:14 - out the door and I learned a lot from
33:18 - them and so I am grateful for that
33:20 - reflection in this moment sometimes
33:23 - again you have to be in the valley right
33:26 - to take a good look
33:28 - so that's all I'm feeling I know
33:32 - see if I'm learning how to do this holy
33:37 - most of the audience is feeling doubtful
33:39 - and confused which are tied at 26
33:43 - percent
33:46 - thank you my hope though is that you
33:51 - leave this conversation and you feel
33:54 - prepared to fight another day
33:57 - ah we need you like some of us in this
34:00 - room where I think we're all kind of in
34:02 - the same age group we've tried and we
34:04 - failed like our generation our
34:06 - leadership has failed you and so you
34:09 - know I earn that through Roy has this
34:10 - great thing about how we're in this
34:11 - portal between the past and the present
34:13 - right and these past leaders are just
34:15 - need to make room for the future in the
34:17 - future is you and so I hope part of this
34:20 - conversation tonight leaves you feeling
34:23 - exhausted but hopeful so our first
34:27 - question is is this as a young black
34:33 - woman from an urban community I've been
34:36 - told countless times that I have to work
34:39 - ten times harder than my suburban white
34:41 - in Asian peers to be seen which has
34:43 - proven to be true what are some of the
34:46 - methods I can use to remain steadfast
34:48 - and assertive in my goals in to invite
34:53 - impostor syndrome when faced with
34:54 - immense negative pressures from others
34:58 - in society
34:58 - Tracy I'd like to call on you as a black
35:02 - woman as a black leader with your
35:04 - background in de and I how would you
35:06 - answer this question yes absolutely and
35:10 - I you know thank you first of all thank
35:13 - you for the bravery of asking us
35:16 - question because it's something that we
35:19 - often in the african-american community
35:20 - talk about with each other
35:22 - but it's important to bring it into this
35:24 - conversation right to talk about it with
35:26 - our advocates and allies so I I just
35:29 - want to share some truth first right the
35:32 - reality we as african-american and black
35:37 - women we must work harder as we are
35:40 - still living in a world or unconscious
35:43 - bias exists and we're underestimated
35:46 - these were the facts and my suggestion
35:50 - is that you practice self-care along the
35:53 - way so that you don't burn out but
35:57 - delivering at your hundred-percent is a
36:00 - must and if you can tie that hundred
36:04 - percent to your passion right and really
36:08 - get clear with the mark that you want to
36:10 - leave in the world based on that hundred
36:13 - percent what you will find is that
36:16 - that's gonna bring you inner peace it's
36:18 - gonna bring you focus it's gonna bring
36:20 - you dry and that is going to sustain you
36:24 - and I'll just share my story as I
36:27 - mentioned Reshma I am you know I'm a
36:31 - technologist at heart and I I Drive
36:34 - innovation for Accenture every day but
36:37 - many times when I walk into the room
36:38 - people think I'm part of the team
36:40 - instead of leading the team mmm-hmm
36:42 - real-time and my my purpose but my
36:46 - purpose as an african-american woman at
36:49 - Accenture is to run a core part of our
36:52 - business one day it's to be part of our
36:55 - C suite as a P&L leader right and my
37:00 - purpose is I want to show that that can
37:02 - be done while being married for 20 years
37:05 - raising two beautiful children and
37:08 - without a massive support system around
37:10 - me and really staying active in the
37:12 - community my purpose is to show that
37:15 - that can be the new normal just like The
37:18 - Cosby Show and I'm definitely dating
37:21 - myself with that but just like The Cosby
37:23 - Show was something that everybody
37:25 - aspired to be I want this to be
37:28 - something that is inspirational for you
37:30 - and so although I'm tired and the whole
37:34 - idea of work-life balance honestly
37:36 - doesn't exist
37:37 - I practice self-care because it's really
37:39 - about fulfilling that higher purpose
37:43 - thank you for that
37:46 - Jennifer's you have anything to add how
37:48 - you've assisted colleagues with certain
37:50 - situations okay I mean first of all
37:54 - Thank You JC that that was very powerful
37:56 - and inspiring for me and I'm sure so
38:01 - many people listening so yeah I
38:04 - appreciate that and I think it's really
38:07 - important for me as a human being
38:11 - it supported for me in my role to
38:15 - support our colleagues be you know an
38:19 - ally but a huge advocate for
38:21 - african-american and black colleagues
38:24 - and women in particular and and should
38:27 - truly and help empower them to make sure
38:31 - that they are taking care of themselves
38:33 - because that is so critical along this
38:36 - journey especially now I mean just the
38:40 - amount of emotional fatigue the trauma
38:45 - and the grief which is really a very
38:50 - misunderstood emotion and it's not
38:53 - linear and it's something that in some
38:55 - ways probably all of us are experiencing
38:58 - just from the loss of life as we knew it
39:01 - and I think that's where the doubtful
39:04 - and confused comes in but you know my
39:06 - passion and my purpose is really to
39:09 - empower people so that they understand
39:11 - that if self-care isn't selfish self
39:14 - care is essential if you are going to
39:18 - change the world and in those that we're
39:22 - talking to you today are truly gonna
39:24 - change the world and so you have to
39:26 - prioritize that and don't ever let
39:29 - anybody tell you not to it is the number
39:33 - one thing that you that you must do in
39:36 - order to you know to persist to be brave
39:41 - and to be successful thank you
39:45 - so our next question how would you
39:49 - suggest navigating a workplace where
39:51 - you're seen as a token minority how do I
39:55 - relieve the pressure of feeling like I
39:56 - have to represent every woman of color
39:58 - in every conversation Wow right so I'll
40:04 - start with the first one because I skip
40:06 - this question all the time when I'm
40:08 - speaking uh at companies in like women
40:12 - when little clever ghetto come to me and
40:14 - be like I don't feel like I belong here
40:15 - and I look at them as like you belong
40:19 - here and then some because you had to
40:21 - work ten times harder to get here
40:23 - right and so part of and it's almost
40:25 - like the secret that like I know but
40:28 - it's a secret like they really don't
40:29 - believe that they are that like the guy
40:34 - over there like he's the one who snuck
40:37 - in not you and so part of it is like
40:40 - this journey of like how do you tell how
40:43 - you teach women women of color to tell
40:46 - that voice in their head that tells them
40:48 - that they're not good enough that
40:49 - they're not strong enough to just be
40:51 - quiet you know and so that is one of the
40:56 - things that I am like on a journey to
40:58 - teach our young women Traci I'd love to
41:03 - hear from you and you to Jennifer I just
41:05 - think that that's so powerful I really
41:08 - do you know so first let me just be
41:10 - clear and talked to all of you as a
41:12 - woman of color you have been selected to
41:16 - join the organizations you are in
41:20 - because of the skill that you have
41:23 - because of the unique value that you
41:25 - bring I just I need you to just take a
41:28 - minute and digest that and once you've
41:31 - digested that I want you to understand
41:36 - that you you're never going to be in
41:37 - control of other people's perceptions of
41:40 - you so don't apologize
41:44 - don't overcompensate you lay faith in
41:47 - the fact that you were meant to be there
41:49 - and then what you do is advocate for
41:53 - yourself again I think one of the first
41:55 - things that you have to do is deliver
41:57 - and perform deliver and perform if you
42:00 - don't leave this call with anything that
42:02 - you know to help
42:04 - Rashmi get get past this inner voice
42:07 - that we said is inside of our head
42:09 - delivery and performance yield results
42:11 - right and in companies results speak for
42:15 - themselves their unrefuted so regardless
42:18 - of the perceptions that people may have
42:20 - or the unconscious bias when you get to
42:22 - the results that becomes your ability to
42:25 - continue moving forward the second thing
42:29 - you do is what you know I think Jennifer
42:32 - spoke so nicely about is really build a
42:34 - group of Board of
42:35 - actors around you write your personal
42:38 - board is your sponsor right like having
42:42 - a group there's nothing like a group of
42:43 - powerful sponsors who can tell your
42:46 - story and help advocate for you to get
42:49 - into new roles and and do things and
42:51 - you'll you'll quickly tell that I love
42:53 - to read because there's another book
42:55 - that one a person on my personal board
42:57 - of directors gave me to read it's I
42:59 - think from Harvey Coleman and it's
43:00 - really about the unwritten rules inside
43:03 - of of companies and you want people
43:07 - whispering that wisdom to you along the
43:09 - way
43:09 - so as you're delivering right you're not
43:12 - bumping into things that persist because
43:15 - of cultural and systemic issues that you
43:18 - don't need to and then I would say the
43:21 - last thing you need to do is really
43:24 - realize that there's if you think about
43:27 - a circle and I talked to my mentors
43:30 - about this mentees about this all the
43:32 - time in the circle is a hundred percent
43:34 - ten percent really represents your
43:37 - skills it's what you bring in the door
43:39 - thirty percent represents your image how
43:43 - are you showing up and so that bringing
43:45 - that confidence being willing to to kind
43:48 - of come to the table and lead the entire
43:50 - rest of that circle is about exposure
43:55 - and so sometimes we get so focused on
43:59 - heads down doing the skills doing the
44:02 - work and we forget to look up and think
44:05 - about the exposure that we need to can I
44:07 - keep going
44:08 - so leaning on your personal board of
44:09 - directors owning the things that are in
44:11 - your control not out of your control
44:13 - will help you be successful I gotta go
44:20 - to the last question and Jennifer all
44:23 - you start answering this one so although
44:26 - I am NOT black I don't want to support
44:28 - the black lives matter movement movement
44:30 - but I don't want to be arrested beaten
44:33 - or seen as not employable for speaking
44:36 - out on the Internet how can I safely
44:38 - make sure I let people know I want to
44:41 - help those in need and to help sustain
44:43 - real change once the outrage is over
44:48 - yeah so that's a question that many of
44:55 - us that are better than black right now
44:58 - and you're trying to figure out and for
45:02 - me you know that looks like learning
45:05 - listening researching reading and you
45:10 - know one of my passions is mental health
45:13 - and reducing the stigma around mental
45:16 - health and you know creating a system
45:19 - that is fair and equitable for everyone
45:24 - to get the mental health care that they
45:26 - need and so I have spent a lot of time
45:29 - in the last several days learning about
45:32 - the history of mental health in the
45:35 - black community and so that that that I
45:38 - understand where they're coming from and
45:40 - what will be helpful for them and just
45:44 - letting that want my colleagues and my
45:46 - friends know that that I'm there for
45:48 - them and you know one-on-one through
45:51 - encouraging text messages you know I I
45:55 - have been speaking out on the Internet
45:58 - I think that that is a very personal
46:00 - choice that you have to make and if it's
46:05 - something you want to do and I feel very
46:07 - passionately about it and I think that
46:11 - it is something that it needs it needs
46:13 - to be said and needs to be heard over
46:16 - and over again and it's not something
46:18 - that we can you know you know get get
46:21 - you all outraged about and put down you
46:25 - know three weeks or no that's not what
46:26 - we're being asked to do that's not what
46:28 - we need to do and so I think that the
46:30 - Internet is is a personal choice I I
46:33 - don't know you know whether you would be
46:36 - you I don't know if you would be judged
46:39 - or not remote from a work perspective on
46:43 - that I think many great organizations
46:46 - are actually speaking out on this issue
46:49 - directly on the internet as well so I
46:52 - think that's a personal choice but I
46:54 - think there's a lot of other things that
46:55 - you can do to support your black friends
46:57 - and probably right now and you
47:01 - donating money as well but for me it's
47:03 - really learning listening and in doing
47:06 - my research and figuring out where I can
47:09 - truly help in focusing they're focusing
47:13 - on what I can control yeah so I'm not
47:19 - gonna tell you go get arrested but I
47:20 - kind of want to UM but I think this is
47:23 - the moment to be an ally and to be an
47:26 - active vocal ally that's what we need
47:29 - like that's what we need right now you
47:33 - know black people have been in the
47:35 - streets fighting for justice for all of
47:37 - us not just for them it's for all of us
47:40 - and so you need to have you need to
47:43 - almost put yourself out of your comfort
47:44 - zone a little bit and go there um thank
47:50 - you everyone for your amazing questions
