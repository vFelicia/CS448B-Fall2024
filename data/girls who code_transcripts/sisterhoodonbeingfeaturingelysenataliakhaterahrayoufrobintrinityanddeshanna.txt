00:00 - [Music]
00:05 - i began using social media around
00:07 - sophomore year of high school and was
00:08 - elated to explore a new world full of
00:10 - possible friends
00:12 - myspace.com was my social media drug of
00:14 - choice
00:15 - i finally felt allowed to be my true
00:17 - weird self
00:19 - in 2010 i received a message from a girl
00:21 - who had great style and a colorful
00:22 - custom coded profile just like mine the
00:25 - message was simple in red hey i like
00:27 - your style
00:28 - i'm starting a group for cool girls and
00:30 - wanted to know if you wanted to be
00:31 - friends
00:32 - i thought to myself what a bold move
00:35 - and immediately responded with yes let's
00:37 - meet in soho next week
00:39 - we clicked instantly and walked around
00:41 - chatting and discussing life in brooklyn
00:43 - we both came from similar upbringings
00:45 - and we're the youngest of three children
00:47 - living in caribbean households
00:49 - throughout our friendship which is now
00:51 - approaching the 10-year mark we've been
00:52 - each other support systems
00:54 - being open within our friendship has led
00:56 - to my work with mental health awareness
00:58 - and the creation of sad girls club a
01:00 - space for women to speak freely about
01:01 - their mental health
01:03 - having someone who you can share your
01:04 - darkest moments is therapeutic
01:06 - and the space to be open with myself
01:08 - through friendship has taught me the
01:09 - power of vulnerability
01:13 - [Music]
01:17 - i always knew that i wanted to make an
01:18 - impact and i thought i had it all
01:20 - figured out i would become a nurse and
01:23 - make a difference in people's lives
01:24 - after a few months i realized that focus
01:27 - wasn't making me happy and i began to
01:29 - explore other options
01:31 - when i discovered computer programming
01:33 - it was love at first sight i loved the
01:35 - infinite number of ways technology could
01:37 - change one person's life or even
01:39 - millions of lives i finally felt excited
01:42 - but when i got into the software
01:44 - engineering program in my school i was
01:46 - intimidated by the fact that most of my
01:47 - classmates were boys who seemed like
01:49 - they knew what they were doing
01:51 - i had to remind myself that i was just
01:54 - entering the field learning how to walk
01:56 - when the boys already learned how to run
01:58 - thankfully a teacher introduced me to
02:00 - girls who code suddenly i found myself
02:02 - learning new skills and more about
02:04 - myself than i ever thought i would i
02:06 - found my voice and how to finally use
02:09 - technology to make an impact on people's
02:11 - lives
02:12 - most importantly i found a family a
02:14 - sisterhood a bond that shared with all
02:17 - girls who love to code
02:21 - [Music]
02:25 - two years ago my cousin and i were
02:26 - waiting in the drive-through of a
02:28 - shawarma restaurant in saudi arabia and
02:30 - while we were waiting for food began
02:32 - talking about our aspirations and what
02:34 - we wanted to do in the future
02:36 - i remember telling her i wanted to be
02:38 - the first female foreign minister of
02:39 - saudi arabia and she wanted to be an
02:41 - engineer both industries that were
02:43 - almost exclusively male dominated this
02:46 - was two years ago before any of the
02:48 - changes in saudi arabia had happened
02:49 - such as the driving ban being lifted and
02:52 - more women being encouraged to enter the
02:53 - work field
02:54 - our conversations were reflecting the
02:56 - obstacles that we'd have to face not
02:58 - because we would not be qualified but
03:00 - just because we were women
03:02 - she might not remember this moment but i
03:04 - will always remember what she said to
03:05 - support me she said you have to work
03:08 - twice as hard but reaching your goal
03:10 - will be twice as sweet
03:12 - at this moment sisterhood seemed to be
03:13 - the most present
03:15 - this simple dialogue strengthened our
03:17 - bond and made us feel both more
03:18 - empowered i now realize although it
03:21 - might not be as overt sisterhood is in
03:23 - every micro interaction i have with all
03:25 - the wonderful female figures in my life
03:28 - [Music]
03:34 - i was born a storyteller
03:36 - as an indigenous woman i was raised
03:38 - amongst the stars
03:40 - bright lights billions of years formed
03:42 - into oral histories
03:45 - stories about my past my present my
03:47 - future
03:49 - stories about my family our history
03:52 - on why we bead on why we fish why the
03:56 - sun shines why the birds sing
03:59 - so i take in knowledge more readily not
04:01 - in abstract presentations or during
04:03 - lectures of the right way but when it is
04:05 - woven into a tapestry of experiences and
04:08 - stories by the people around me
04:11 - my generation's experiences will be
04:13 - passed this way too
04:15 - we will talk about how we built entire
04:17 - cities by stacking zeros and ones
04:19 - how we use strings of letters to connect
04:21 - populations across land masses
04:24 - of how i became a member of a sisterhood
04:26 - so strong that distance and physical
04:29 - presence were of no matter
04:31 - and about how learning a simple skill
04:33 - and sharing that with others
04:35 - changed my own life so dramatically
04:38 - [Music]
04:43 - in my childhood my brother and i were
04:45 - always partnered in playing video game
04:48 - when we got older i followed my
04:51 - interested in video game and pursued a
04:53 - bachelor degree in computer science from
04:56 - university
04:57 - my brother he worked with us special
05:00 - force and afghan commandos when he come
05:03 - home he would tell me stories of how
05:05 - brave the afghan commandos were and
05:07 - about the dangers they face around the
05:10 - same time i discovered kotone spy which
05:13 - gives girls in afghanistan a chance to
05:16 - learn computer coding and game
05:18 - development
05:19 - for our e-first hackathon we were tasked
05:23 - to address a problem in our community
05:25 - and present the solution inspired by one
05:28 - of my brother's stories i decided to
05:31 - increase people's awareness of the
05:33 - bravery of our commandos
05:36 - together with my teammates as he knows
05:38 - that kia nargis samiro and me would
05:40 - create the game fight against opium
05:43 - in the game afghan soldiers destroy
05:45 - opium fields and grow saffron instead of
05:48 - opium
05:49 - with the game we hope to create cultural
05:52 - change in the attitudes behaviors and
05:56 - future of the region
05:58 - sisterhood in our team has enabled us to
06:01 - work together have an exchange of
06:03 - thoughts motivations and also make the
06:06 - greatest change in our communities by
06:08 - helping one another our goal as afghan
06:12 - gay school code is to create games that
06:14 - serve and help our homeland to help
06:16 - build afghanistan 2.0 by afghan girls
06:20 - court
06:27 - i wasn't sure i could be a mother
06:30 - then i found out i was pregnant and once
06:32 - trinity was born and i saw her tiny cute
06:35 - face i knew at that moment i'd always
06:38 - have her back
06:39 - by three
06:40 - trinity told me she wasn't a boy but a
06:43 - girl at first i wasn't sure what to do
06:47 - and there were no stories about young
06:48 - trans kids out there but when i saw her
06:51 - struggling to live with someone she
06:53 - never was i knew it was time to prove
06:55 - exactly what i promised when i first
06:58 - held her
06:59 - i promise to always have her back and
07:01 - love her no matter what
07:03 - i'd always be there
07:05 - trinity and i have been a teen
07:07 - which is our version of sisterhood but
07:10 - i have to say is trinity's mom
07:13 - she's my community and my heart it makes
07:16 - me laugh a lot and i work hard to be her
07:18 - community and advocate for us
07:21 - being a sisterhood means we can now
07:23 - uplift others with our story
07:25 - i can share what it has been like and
07:28 - continues to be like as mom to a trans
07:30 - child
07:31 - and i can share my story of being a
07:34 - happy and thriving black trans girl
07:38 - being a sisterhood means facing our
07:40 - fears together and living life with love
07:43 - affirmation and togetherness
07:46 - always a sisterhood
07:49 - [Music]
07:52 - we say this part together
07:55 - always a sisterhood
