03:21 - and a member of the girls of codes staff
03:23 - will respond and so we want to kick off
03:26 - tonight's conversation with an
03:28 - icebreaker for our panelists the
03:30 - question I'm going to ask you both to
03:32 - think about is what's the most valuable
03:35 - piece of career advice you've been given
03:37 - and who gave it to you and so for our
03:40 - viewers while our panelists are thinking
03:42 - about that give me one second I'm seeing
03:48 - the pull to and cannot see my notes
03:49 - sorry about that
03:52 - for our viewers will be posing a similar
03:55 - icebreaker question for you to answer
03:57 - using the polls feature this will be the
03:59 - first of three polling questions and you
04:02 - will have 30 seconds to respond so for
04:05 - now
04:05 - join us and share your answer to the
04:08 - icebreaker who do you look to for career
04:11 - advice and so Keanu while folks are
04:16 - thinking about that for 30 seconds I
04:17 - want to start and ask you to kick us off
04:19 - by sharing who's giving you the best
04:22 - career advice and what was that advice
04:25 - thanks for asking this is very
04:28 - non-traditional this is someone who has
04:30 - less career experience than I do
04:33 - but the person who gives me the best
04:35 - career advice is my younger sister so
04:37 - she is five years younger than me and
04:39 - she is an amazing freelancer in the
04:42 - graphic design space and her advice is
04:46 - always solid and someone who is always
04:49 - on the go
04:49 - need to make sure things are perfect and
04:51 - I never sit down and head for her the
04:55 - reason of why she gave me was to just
04:57 - sit down and breathe just take a step
05:00 - back and just relax
05:02 - and for her one thing that she does is
05:05 - to take a daily walk so I started taking
05:07 - those opportunities with her to do that
05:10 - thank you so much Kiana that's actually
05:13 - amazing your sister sounds wise beyond
05:15 - her years because that whole sit down
05:16 - and take a moment that's wisdom right
05:19 - there Chelsea I want to ask you the same
05:21 - question
05:22 - what would you want to share with us
05:33 - Chelsea are you there listen I know we
05:40 - had Chelsea so the question is where is
05:42 - she now because I see her so I'm gonna
05:49 - give Chelsea one minute for our girls
05:54 - who code team let's just double-check if
05:55 - we can get oh I see Chelsea you're muted
05:58 - that could be a huge factor I do see
06:01 - that you know what we can do let's
06:13 - actually look at some of what our
06:15 - answers are and then we can come back to
06:18 - Chelsea to try to get her answer to this
06:20 - question hopefully that works for our
06:22 - girls who code teen maybe we can start
06:24 - looking at some of the answers we got to
06:27 - our poll in terms of who folks look to
06:30 - in terms of career advice so what I'm
06:36 - seeing here is that our top three
06:38 - answers work parents no surprise
06:40 - followed by teachers or professors and
06:43 - then folks said you know that larger
06:46 - category of just other folks while we're
06:49 - waiting for Chelsea I'll say that for me
06:51 - it is definitely I would say my
06:54 - girlfriend's the folks who are at that
06:55 - same point in their career as I am who I
06:58 - can turn to and just sort of say what do
07:01 - you think about this when the best piece
07:03 - of
07:03 - I've ever gotten is to even if it
07:05 - doesn't seem like to basically give
07:08 - something a shot even if it's not
07:09 - exactly in your comfort zone and I've
07:12 - really appreciated that it's made me
07:13 - think about things that I wouldn't may
07:15 - have may have in the past just said oh I
07:17 - don't want to do that and they've kind
07:18 - of pushed me to say why don't you think
07:20 - about it why don't you give it a shot so
07:23 - any word from the girls who code team
07:26 - whether we have Chelsea and if she's
07:27 - able to join us either audio video or
07:32 - both I think we're looking to get in
07:38 - contact with her okay I'm gonna do
07:40 - something back listen I know she's
07:43 - coming back the question is when and so
07:45 - with that I might keep us moving a bit
07:49 - so thank you everyone viewers for
07:52 - participating in that Quick Poll we
07:54 - definitely want to get Chelsea back but
07:56 - as we're working to do that I want to
07:58 - keep our conversation going because
07:59 - there's so much for us to talk about and
08:01 - we recognize that all of us can use a
08:03 - little bit of advice as Kovach 19 has
08:06 - the tech landscape and opportunities
08:08 - continuously changing and so as we move
08:11 - into tonight's panel discussion we want
08:14 - to find out how students can better
08:16 - navigate all of these changes and so if
08:19 - you're a returning viewer you know that
08:21 - we look to address the concerns of our
08:23 - college staged alumni and students
08:25 - across the country who are in varying
08:27 - stages of their college experience our
08:29 - first question for panelist really has
08:34 - are rising college and first-year
08:36 - students at the forefront of our minds
08:38 - and so we've all seen the articles and
08:41 - reports stating that hundreds of
08:43 - companies have canceled their internship
08:45 - programs and have Rison rescinded offers
08:48 - many of the cancellation stem from
08:50 - things that you can imagine logistical
08:53 - challenges or from cost-cutting at
08:55 - companies that are being cautious or who
08:57 - have suffered economic damage from the
08:59 - pandemic this makes it really difficult
09:01 - to land an internship if an offer has
09:03 - not already been confirmed and so the
09:06 - question that I want to sort of start
09:08 - off with for students who are in this
09:11 - predicament with no professional
09:12 - experiences lined up for the summer
09:14 - what alternative skill building at
09:17 - tivities gap-filling experiences or
09:19 - professional opportunities should
09:21 - students pursue in lieu of internships I
09:25 - don't know whether Oh Chelsea you're
09:28 - here thank goodness I was about to say
09:30 - Chelsea you're on but I was going to
09:32 - take a risk so with that I'm gonna let
09:34 - you both answer that question and also
09:38 - if you don't mind just tacking on that
09:39 - little bit of you know the best career
09:41 - advice and who you got it from so we can
09:43 - get like a two-for-one yes yes everyone
09:46 - I'm so excited to eat meet you today and
09:49 - to be on this panel best advice I ever
09:51 - received was from my first mentor when I
09:55 - graduated Spellman college and I started
09:57 - working in finance I I was given a
10:00 - mentor to help me assimilate and they
10:03 - said only pursue this career if you're
10:05 - passionate about it and you know at the
10:07 - time we often hear that comment do what
10:10 - you're passionate about do what you love
10:11 - but it really has been one of the most
10:14 - important things that I ever received in
10:15 - my early career years because I've been
10:18 - able to really find work that is
10:20 - authentic to who I am okay so that's
10:23 - that's the answer to that question and
10:24 - then I'm your next question oh I love
10:27 - this question because I've been thinking
10:28 - about it is there's so many brilliant
10:31 - students across the country who are
10:33 - finding themselves in this situation
10:36 - right because of coded and the thing is
10:38 - there's so many things that you can do
10:40 - without an internship and that's the
10:41 - first thing I want to mention to you
10:42 - even that you have a vision for a dream
10:45 - internship you can use this time to
10:48 - really hone in on a skill set explore a
10:51 - new hobby or interest I was speaking
10:53 - with my mentee earlier today and she
10:55 - said I lost my internship what do I do
10:56 - and I said what are you passionate about
10:58 - she said marketing you know I want to
11:00 - get into the marketing space and I said
11:02 - you know what with technology you have
11:04 - every resource within front of you from
11:07 - YouTube to podcasts to TED Talks
11:11 - to books everything is in front of you
11:12 - so you really want to make sure that
11:14 - you're taking advantage of those
11:16 - resources so that's what I would say for
11:17 - students leverage what you can lever
11:19 - what's within your reach Chelsea thank
11:23 - you so much I love that answer because
11:25 - it's so accessible and it's stuff that
11:26 - you overlook because it's a party or day
11:28 - to day and you don't think it's a skill
11:30 - building activity
11:30 - when it can be keanu what do you think
11:34 - about this question especially with
11:35 - these internships potentially
11:36 - evaporating what advice do you give
11:38 - around the skill building component my
11:41 - advice is actually similar to Chelsea's
11:43 - and in the regards of building on your
11:46 - skills or even building on skills that
11:47 - you hope to learn for example there are
11:51 - so many free courses now and I feel like
11:54 - right now people are willing to have
11:56 - informational interviews and show your
11:58 - even job shadowing opportunities one
12:01 - advice that I gave my sister was to
12:03 - build your own curriculum like you may
12:05 - not be in a summer internship and you
12:06 - can build your own summer curriculum
12:08 - 9:00 to 5:00 you should be doing
12:10 - something whether it's informational
12:12 - interview at 10:00 to 11:00 and then
12:15 - 11:00 at 12:00 you could be taking free
12:17 - Coursera courses in that at 12 to 1 you
12:20 - can be volunteering at a local nonprofit
12:21 - to support their social media campaign I
12:24 - think volunteerism is something that's
12:26 - really overlooked and that's an
12:28 - experience where you can really gain
12:30 - those transferable skills even though
12:32 - you may not be getting paid for it I
12:35 - love that answer also and what's amazing
12:38 - about it is that you're kind of marrying
12:40 - empowerment but also structure because
12:43 - this is a really tough time for a lot of
12:44 - people where a lot of these internships
12:46 - sort of giving you structure in the
12:48 - absence of that sometimes it can be
12:49 - daunting so I love the tiny blocks as an
12:52 - idea so thank you so much for sharing
12:53 - that I also want to be really
12:55 - transparent about where how we've
12:57 - thought about this at girls who code we
12:59 - also made the tough decision to cancel
13:01 - our summer internship program for
13:03 - college aid students considering the
13:05 - significant financial obligation and the
13:07 - inability to guarantee office space for
13:10 - our interns however we are still very
13:13 - much interested in providing college-age
13:16 - alumni and students with the opportunity
13:18 - to join a college loop nearest their
13:20 - location for more information or to
13:23 - enroll click on the link that has just
13:26 - been placed in the chat box and you'll
13:28 - hear from a girls of code staffer in the
13:30 - near future and you know moving along in
13:34 - terms of other questions
13:35 - our next question speaks to current
13:37 - college students who may need internship
13:40 - opportunities to fulfill course
13:42 - requirements which is a whole other
13:44 - thing
13:44 - we know not all hope is lost for college
13:47 - students because all internships have
13:49 - not been cancelled we know a number of
13:52 - banks and technology firms have
13:54 - shortened their programs by a few weeks
13:56 - or have converted to virtual experiences
13:59 - so here comes our second poll for our
14:01 - viewers please let us know the status of
14:04 - your summer plans and if you feel
14:06 - prepared for internship opportunities by
14:09 - answering the poll question on your
14:11 - screen please remember you have 30
14:14 - seconds to respond and while we wait for
14:17 - viewers to respond Keanu and Chelsea our
14:21 - next question for you is what should
14:24 - students do to prepare for virtual and
14:27 - post kovat 19 internship opportunities
14:30 - what types of candidates are employers
14:32 - looking to hire currently and overall
14:35 - and maybe I'll start and just ask
14:37 - Chelsea if you'd weigh in on that
14:39 - question yeah sure I'll start with the
14:42 - skills first if I think you know that's
14:44 - something that that's a little easier to
14:46 - discuss and the skills front I actually
14:49 - had been doing quite a bit of research
14:51 - there's an organization called the
14:52 - National Association of Colleges and
14:54 - employers and they're all the
14:55 - universities and colleges across the
14:57 - country and many employers of early
15:00 - career talent and I was looking at their
15:02 - report of the most important skills that
15:05 - are necessary for for students and what
15:08 - tops the list is I'm solving being a
15:10 - strong critical thinker communication
15:13 - skills written and oral your ability to
15:17 - manage time intercultural fluency which
15:20 - is how you connect with who are
15:21 - different from you which right now we
15:23 - could be all learning about the
15:25 - importance diversity inclusion and
15:27 - equity right that matters for
15:28 - organizations and so those skills are
15:31 - going to be pivotally important data
15:33 - analysis okay that's very very important
15:36 - how do you use technology certainly
15:38 - girls who code is leading in that space
15:40 - but across the board how do you use
15:42 - technology to communicate with people
15:44 - it's likely you will be on a global team
15:47 - or you'll have colleagues who are across
15:48 - the country so you want to be prepared
15:50 - with those skills and so I would say
15:52 - that that's really important on the
15:54 - skills piece the second side of this
15:56 - conversation has to do with
15:58 - what you can do right for some of you
16:02 - who don't have a formal internship you
16:04 - can be using now to refine your story
16:06 - you can think about the marketing
16:08 - material your marketing materials your
16:10 - resume your cover letter LinkedIn and
16:12 - you can make sure that those are
16:13 - top-notch because when you do get on
16:15 - campus it's likely that employers will
16:18 - start to explore options for the Fall
16:21 - getting back in in terms of engaging
16:23 - students in a way that they can this is
16:25 - what I'm hearing and so you don't want
16:26 - to say I'm gonna wait until the fall you
16:28 - want to start to build your story and
16:30 - start connecting with employers now
16:32 - that's gonna be critically important the
16:34 - last piece all share is LinkedIn I have
16:37 - heard that girls who code scholars have
16:39 - lengthens that's what episode I've told
16:41 - you want to make sure that you're
16:42 - getting used to LinkedIn I'm connecting
16:45 - with people certainly kuna and I we want
16:47 - to hear from you and anyone else who you
16:49 - connect with you and each other start to
16:51 - build those connections virtually
16:53 - because they're gonna be important when
16:54 - you start your job search thank you so
16:58 - much Chelsea that is an amazing answer
17:00 - and so thoughtful
17:02 - before I hear from Kiana I'm actually
17:04 - gonna tell you what our viewers said so
17:07 - 5% of our viewers have secured an
17:10 - internship and feel prepared for the
17:12 - experience so that's amazing shout out
17:15 - to you for feeling that way 8% of our
17:17 - viewers have secured an internship
17:19 - experience and do not feel prepared so
17:22 - again some of this talk is very much
17:24 - focused on being able to support you 60%
17:27 - of our viewers have not secured an
17:29 - internship and don't know how to prepare
17:31 - thank you for sharing that this informs
17:34 - this very conversation and we'll try to
17:36 - be as responsive as we can to that and
17:38 - finally 19% of our viewers haven't
17:41 - secured an internship but feel prepared
17:43 - for the experience which is also great
17:45 - we want to thank viewers for your
17:47 - bravery and candor and just letting us
17:49 - know where you are because it really
17:50 - helps our panelists and with that Kiana
17:53 - do you want to also respond to sort of
17:55 - the preparation and just what you hear
17:57 - coming out of this polling data from our
17:59 - current viewers yes thank you all for
18:03 - sharing your your situations and where
18:06 - you are right now it definitely is
18:07 - helpful as I'm speaking for the to the
18:09 - next point and that next point is to
18:11 - keep
18:11 - looking for opportunities there's still
18:14 - opportunities out there there's still
18:15 - time there are companies who are seeing
18:18 - what's happening and are getting
18:19 - creative so whether it's a part-time
18:21 - internship an unpaid internship or even
18:24 - a virtual platform that they're building
18:26 - so that and students can get in touch
18:28 - with their co-workers air colleagues and
18:30 - employers those are still out there from
18:33 - what I would start with your career
18:34 - services office I as a university
18:37 - recruiter I know there is a strong
18:39 - network of university recruiters and
18:41 - career services out there who really
18:43 - want to support students during this
18:45 - time so start with your career services
18:47 - office set up time on their calendar
18:49 - just to figure out what would be the
18:51 - best game plan for you and you never
18:53 - know who they mean who they may know and
18:55 - what opportunities that are on their
18:57 - desk from there take advantage of
19:00 - virtual career fairs and virtual
19:03 - platforms that are out there
19:05 - I know Chelsea mentioned mace that's
19:08 - aligned AT&T now has a summer virtual
19:11 - platform and this is an opportunity for
19:13 - students to gain professional skills
19:16 - some that Chelsea mentioned such as
19:18 - problem solving
19:19 - time management these are courses that
19:21 - you can take on your own on your own
19:22 - case and you can still put this on your
19:24 - resume as a certificate or a program
19:27 - that you've done throughout köppen 19
19:29 - and how you build on your skills and
19:31 - they're really interactive so you feel
19:32 - like you're gaining something from them
19:34 - and then lastly is to work on your
19:37 - contacts so whether it's through your
19:39 - career services office or your own
19:41 - personal branding and folks in your
19:43 - network on LinkedIn but even also your
19:46 - alumni of girls to code or alumni of
19:48 - your University definitely leverage
19:51 - what's out there because there's still
19:53 - are opportunities so don't want you to
19:55 - feel like it's time to give up one thing
19:59 - that Chelsea mentioned was
20:01 - problem-solving skills that is so
20:03 - important as a candidate and that is why
20:06 - employees are always looking for that's
20:07 - something I look for in candidates
20:09 - especially right now this generation is
20:13 - the biggest problem solvers they're the
20:15 - biggest group that I know to be able to
20:17 - get creative during this time and figure
20:19 - out how they're still going to navigate
20:21 - and figure out their summer plans
20:23 - another one is curiosity and
20:25 - positivity I know it is hard to be
20:28 - positive especially with all that's
20:30 - going on right now and this week in the
20:32 - news and media but that's definitely
20:35 - something that we look for and
20:36 - candidates and how they really put a
20:37 - spin on things you make it seem like no
20:40 - I didn't on an internship during this
20:42 - time I was able to bid on XYZ skills
20:45 - through these opportunities can I thank
20:50 - you so much for that and it's especially
20:52 - meaningful because we know that you
20:54 - actually run the now virtual internship
20:57 - program at Xander's your perspective is
20:58 - so valuable I guess I have a follow-up
21:00 - question both for you and for Chelsea
21:02 - where should students actually be
21:04 - looking for internship opportunities are
21:07 - there websites companies influencers in
21:09 - the tech space that you think our
21:11 - viewers should be following and just
21:13 - thinking about right now because
21:14 - obviously everyone is on the hunt for
21:16 - something Chelsea do you want to start
21:20 - with that sure sure
21:22 - can't I already got us started on that
21:24 - by talking about LinkedIn that's a big
21:26 - one I will tell you I was on LinkedIn an
21:28 - hour before this session I feel that
21:31 - every time I get on LinkedIn someone is
21:32 - posting a new internship opportunity
21:34 - something that they're designing for for
21:37 - students right so this particular
21:38 - organization called guild education out
21:41 - of San Francisco area um they just
21:44 - announced today an internship first they
21:47 - market it for graduates but then they
21:48 - said we want to support recent grads too
21:50 - and so it is a project-based internship
21:53 - seven different seven to eight different
21:55 - divisions and they're gonna create a
21:56 - project so it won't be the full
21:58 - internship experience maybe you're used
22:00 - to but you're still gonna get the skills
22:01 - you're still gonna connect with new
22:03 - people you're still gonna understand
22:04 - this ecosystem of Education and reform
22:06 - and Workforce Development so every day
22:10 - people are trying to get creative to
22:12 - support your generation link and
22:14 - Chelsea's opinion is essential for
22:17 - students and for certainly if you're a
22:19 - graduate and I think it you know
22:21 - lengthens important regardless of your
22:22 - industry or sector because that is
22:25 - really like a virtual it's like your
22:27 - virtual rolodex of relationships it's
22:29 - like replaced all these business cards
22:31 - that maybe you were used to collecting
22:33 - at one point now have it all online like
22:35 - sign me up for that right so
22:37 - card is what are you saying that's but I
22:42 - do appreciate you saying that
22:45 - so point-blank you need LinkedIn so if
22:49 - anybody's on on the line today Lily and
22:51 - even they're an amazing organization
22:52 - because they put a lot of free content
22:54 - out for students as well on the college
22:57 - code website and I believe it'll be
23:00 - shared in the email in the chat you will
23:02 - see one thing we have is the LinkedIn
23:04 - checklist
23:05 - it's basically for people who need help
23:07 - refining your page it's a one-page or
23:09 - LinkedIn is created for students so you
23:11 - have an optimal profile that helps you
23:13 - connect with employers and professionals
23:16 - that's the kind of stuff that you want
23:17 - to be using handshake is another one
23:19 - connected to colleges and universities
23:21 - and then indeed I think is just another
23:23 - search engine that it doesn't hurt for
23:25 - you to check that if you want to talk
23:27 - about local opportunities in your city
23:29 - or your state Canon did I miss anything
23:32 - amazing Chelsea especially the concrete
23:35 - resources that you're pointing to and
23:37 - we're gonna try to capture as much of
23:38 - what you said to share with our viewers
23:40 - because those were amazing and kyaaa
23:41 - that is the right question what did
23:43 - Chelsea miss if anything Chelsea that
23:46 - was amazing I think you cover it up most
23:48 - of it and with LinkedIn I feel like
23:51 - people get at least I can say from my
23:54 - personal experience I was worried about
23:56 - LinkedIn because I needed to pay for a
23:59 - premium or I needed to put in split some
24:02 - cost down to take their courses I think
24:05 - this is a great time and check in with
24:06 - your university they may have with your
24:09 - Career Services offices office they may
24:11 - have an opportunity for you to gain free
24:13 - courses through LinkedIn through
24:16 - Coursera and check out some other open
24:19 - internships some of those may be a
24:21 - future math they have an internship
24:23 - program where their deadline is tomorrow
24:25 - at midnight so you still have time
24:27 - intern hacks comm is an opportunity for
24:30 - students to participate in a
24:32 - project-based internship and also check
24:35 - out some awesome like freelance
24:37 - opportunities one freelance job or that
24:40 - I like and I referred to my younger
24:42 - sister is up work so that's where you
24:45 - can literally just put them profile
24:46 - together what are some of your skills
24:48 - that you want to build on or you want to
24:50 - share
24:50 - you can even get paid for it so those
24:53 - are some platforms that I would take
24:54 - advantage of and that is I'm using I
24:57 - feel like we are absolutely inundated
24:59 - with some really really cool resources
25:01 - that our viewers can immediately go on
25:03 - and check out and hopefully build their
25:06 - own profile and gain access to some of
25:08 - these opportunities that might not be
25:10 - readily clear - people are still out
25:12 - there so we appreciate that very much I
25:14 - also realized that we should plug our
25:17 - girls who code hire me our career
25:19 - readiness platform specifically for our
25:21 - lungs we have internships and job
25:25 - opportunities posted there from our
25:26 - corporate partners who are looking for
25:28 - talent so please don't hesitate to check
25:31 - that out or reach out to us should you
25:33 - have questions around that
25:34 - and I want us to pivot actually to focus
25:37 - on how virtual internships will impact
25:40 - soon-to-be graduates full time
25:42 - employment opportunities we talked about
25:45 - different folks who make up our network
25:47 - and we really want to think about
25:49 - soon-to-be graduates with this question
25:50 - so the typical internship includes
25:53 - opportunities for professional
25:55 - development leadership interaction and
25:57 - time for special projects some students
26:01 - fear the virtual internships will
26:03 - deprive them from the most important
26:05 - aspects of the experience networking
26:08 - opportunities that could lead to
26:09 - full-time employment everyone knows that
26:12 - that FaceTime that connection the way
26:15 - that you you know have that opportunity
26:16 - to come in contact with all these
26:18 - professionals could help who could help
26:20 - you with your professional trajectory
26:22 - this is a really big fear so companies
26:26 - who have little to no experience with
26:28 - remote work before the summer and will
26:30 - be using this opportunity to establish a
26:32 - set of best practices which if we're
26:34 - going to keep it real may mean that they
26:36 - you know experience might be a bit rocky
26:39 - in these virtual settings so the
26:41 - question for both of you are virtual
26:44 - internships worth it and will employers
26:47 - see them as valuable professional
26:49 - experiences when applying for full-time
26:52 - roles and so Keanu I'm gonna start with
26:55 - you and then ask Chelsea to weigh in
26:58 - thank you I definitely see virtual
27:02 - internships being worth it and something
27:04 - employers are looking at especially this
27:07 - summer and I'm looking for full-time
27:09 - hires after Coppa 19 as we mentioned
27:13 - there are many transferable skills that
27:15 - you can build through virtual
27:17 - internships and through project-based
27:19 - internships and the most important ones
27:22 - that we mentioned were problem-solving
27:23 - time management and a curiosity and also
27:27 - the networking piece that you mentioned
27:29 - those are still things you can get from
27:31 - a virtual internship or even you billing
27:33 - your own summer curriculum
27:35 - I feel like now more than ever people
27:36 - are leading connection and feeling the
27:40 - need to reach out to folks and have
27:42 - conversations on a regular basis since
27:44 - we're not in the office chatting with
27:46 - people in the cafe or in the restroom
27:48 - like this is the time where people
27:50 - definitely are putting their hands and
27:53 - arms out there to reach out to folks who
27:55 - are looking for opportunities jobs or
27:58 - internships so I think that networking
28:00 - piece you can definitely hone in on as
28:02 - well as the other skill sets that you're
28:04 - looking to build through a virtual
28:06 - internship me personally with our Xander
28:08 - internship we are doing a lot to make
28:11 - sure that our students still feel a part
28:14 - of the business and supported that sense
28:15 - of belonging but also guilt building on
28:17 - those skill sets that they're looking
28:19 - for so there is a way that companies are
28:21 - getting really creative with these
28:22 - opportunities so I won't I definitely
28:25 - don't think you should miss out on them
28:27 - thank you so much Chelsea what would you
28:30 - add to that first of all it's so awesome
28:33 - that Xander's keeping their program I
28:35 - mean that that's huge because there's so
28:37 - many organizations who have had to pivot
28:40 - and to cancel listen this is the thing
28:43 - it's less a question about preference
28:46 - and more a conversation on the reality
28:48 - of where we're moving with work and for
28:51 - some of you you've probably heard the
28:53 - term and maybe not future of work it's
28:55 - this buzzy fancy topic that's like
28:57 - what's the future of the workforce
28:59 - what's the future of how people will get
29:01 - jobs what's the future of the skip
29:03 - what's the conversation on the skills
29:05 - and jobs that are necessary and this is
29:08 - really a conversation about how work is
29:11 - changing it's a conversation about can
29:13 - you work effectively remotely could you
29:16 - be in California or
29:17 - sis or New York City and get your work
29:20 - done or do you need to actually be in
29:22 - physical space with with your colleagues
29:24 - now I'm a fan of working with with
29:26 - people but it's a business conversation
29:28 - so students what's the point for you
29:30 - you're building a skill
29:32 - even if inter even if virtual
29:34 - internships is a thing of the past
29:36 - there's a skill that you're building in
29:38 - connecting with your colleagues who are
29:40 - multicultural multi-generational they
29:43 - live in different places in the country
29:44 - you are building the skill of being able
29:46 - to communicate over a computer or over
29:49 - the phone and so I would look at it more
29:52 - as even if this is the only time I do it
29:54 - how can I maximize this experience so
29:56 - that I have a new skill set under my
29:58 - belt that's what you want to be asking
30:01 - yourself because again it's likely for
30:03 - some of you you will try a virtual
30:05 - internship and your full time offer
30:07 - could be virtual some organizations may
30:10 - say we're going to go completely virtual
30:11 - it's very possible and so you weren't
30:14 - gonna start flexing your muscle and look
30:16 - at it as an opportunity Chelsey I love
30:19 - that answer and it resonates so much
30:21 - because you're right we're talking
30:23 - within this one moment this one paradigm
30:25 - where everything is turned on its head
30:27 - because of the pandemic but truth be
30:29 - told we are moving closer and more fully
30:32 - into understanding virtual taking up
30:34 - rather than like five percent of a
30:36 - company's time it's upwards of 30 50 70
30:39 - everyone was kind of coming to this
30:40 - understanding collectively and I love
30:43 - that you said it's about skills and that
30:45 - no matter what a virtual internship is
30:47 - still a valuable skill building
30:49 - experience so thank you so much for sort
30:52 - of wrapping up our panel portion of the
30:54 - discussion on that wonderful high note I
30:56 - want to thank you both in terms of just
30:58 - you know how amazing you've been in
31:00 - answering those questions and we want to
31:01 - pivot now to actually open it up to Q&A
31:04 - so we selected questions from our girls
31:07 - to quote alumni in community who are
31:10 - viewing this conversation and would like
31:12 - further items the first question comes
31:14 - from Andrea W there are a lot of unpaid
31:17 - and remote internship opportunities
31:19 - online now do you foresee internships
31:21 - being remote from now on since they can
31:24 - be more flexible and they potentially
31:25 - paste students less so very similar to
31:28 - what we were just talking about with a
31:29 - little twist
31:30 - especially that part
31:31 - you know being a little bit more
31:33 - flexible and paying less I don't know
31:36 - count if you want to start by just
31:37 - giving us your thoughts in response to
31:39 - that this question I definitely thought
31:44 - of the future work how many companies
31:47 - are going virtual anyway at the same
31:50 - time there is a value in on on-site
31:54 - interviews so I'm not too sure there are
31:57 - definitely key points and a value of it
31:59 - for example the candidate experience and
32:01 - really being able to show the culture of
32:03 - a company that's something that you
32:04 - really get from a on-site experience and
32:08 - that's something that companies are
32:09 - considering right now as we're hosts or
32:12 - like figuring out open 19 for us
32:15 - personally up dinner I know there is
32:17 - also like onboarding considerations and
32:20 - onboarding is the most important part of
32:23 - an employer and an insurance experience
32:25 - at a company that can to pick if they
32:27 - stay at the company or not how long
32:29 - they're there if that onboarding piece
32:31 - isn't right then it could slip and
32:33 - that's something that companies are also
32:35 - thinking about so it's a it's a toss up
32:38 - we shall see what happens the last point
32:40 - on internships virtual internships being
32:43 - more flexible and students being paid
32:45 - less I'm not quite sure about it I think
32:48 - I think internships are still they I
32:53 - won't say I want to sue that they're all
32:55 - very as much flexible even though their
32:57 - virtual they still have 9:00 to 5:00
32:59 - 9:00 to 6:00 and students are still
33:02 - expected to be at their computer and
33:04 - their dust during that time even though
33:05 - we can't actually see what's happening
33:07 - they're not still in expectation and for
33:10 - many internships where students were
33:11 - already getting paid for the
33:13 - opportunities but it changed virtual
33:14 - they're still getting those hourly rate
33:17 - wages or salary for that opportunity so
33:21 - I wouldn't assume that for all
33:22 - opportunities or all virtual internships
33:25 - thank you so much Kiana for giving us so
33:28 - much info on that especially the kind of
33:31 - spicy question about pay or
33:32 - accountability or what it may look like
33:34 - and the assumptions we have about it
33:36 - being less than in fact it might be very
33:39 - equal to what the other in-person
33:41 - experience is so thank you for weighing
33:43 - in on that - Chelsea what would you
33:45 - what's your response to that well you
33:48 - were you were speaking so eloquent
33:50 - eloquently about it because I was going
33:52 - to say I think the presumption is that
33:54 - you're getting less or that it is unpaid
33:57 - when in actuality in many ways employers
34:01 - will save money large companies
34:03 - medium-sized companies are intern
34:05 - programs there's an investment right
34:07 - there's a fee and having your interns
34:08 - how much you're paid interns but then
34:11 - also all the programming all the free
34:13 - swag and snacks you get even though all
34:16 - the events and so there's a cost to that
34:18 - and so now that sadly that won't be a
34:20 - part of summer 2020 or even fall you
34:23 - know forward fall intern recruiting a
34:25 - lot of this is speculation we don't know
34:28 - but I would say I think most employers
34:30 - want to do the right thing by early
34:32 - career talent you are a part of their
34:35 - future workforce and really a part of
34:37 - their career employee base and so you
34:40 - know they want to make they want to make
34:41 - you happy they want you to be excited
34:43 - about your role so I think most people
34:45 - are going to try to keep pay and
34:47 - competitive pay and benefits and perks
34:49 - where they can even even through times
34:52 - like Kovac so this year we might see a
34:54 - shift in an adjustment but I think when
34:56 - you think about the full space of
34:58 - university recruiting culture and let's
35:01 - also talk diversity and inclusion this
35:03 - is girls who code there's also a big
35:05 - focus on how do we provide diverse
35:09 - offerings and benefits to our employees
35:13 - so I don't think it's something that
35:14 - people are ignoring you know I
35:16 - appreciate that and I think both you and
35:18 - Kiana touch on sort of like all of a
35:19 - sudden onboarding doesn't go out the
35:21 - window
35:21 - all of a sudden valuing you know people
35:24 - who are coming on board doesn't go out
35:25 - the window
35:25 - these are still internships that could
35:28 - result in a full time opportunity and
35:30 - wanting to bring you into that full
35:32 - experience so I'm glad to hear you kind
35:35 - of support that companies are giving
35:37 - this thought and that folks shouldn't
35:38 - assume that as you said that it would be
35:40 - a less than experience so thank you for
35:43 - sharing that so our next question is
35:46 - from Lena G what skills or experience
35:49 - should internship and job seekers
35:51 - highlight on their resumes to get
35:53 - noticed by recruiters during this time
35:55 - Kiana do you want to start with that one
35:59 - yes I think we mentioned some of the
36:03 - soft skills that some of the hard skills
36:05 - such as the skills that I would
36:07 - recommend that employ candidates or
36:10 - interns have on their resume are any
36:13 - certificates or courses that they're
36:15 - taking during this time there's a way
36:17 - that you can add that onto your resume
36:19 - you can put it on there you can have a
36:20 - link to it and the date site you took
36:22 - that course and a brief description of
36:24 - it you can also put any volunteer
36:26 - opportunities that you're currently
36:28 - involved in or expecting to leave all
36:30 - involved in you can put that on your
36:32 - resume as well and continue to ask folks
36:35 - especially with LinkedIn now your
36:37 - virtual resume you can ask folks for
36:40 - endorsements or recommendations through
36:43 - LinkedIn so even if it's a freelance
36:46 - opportunity that you're doing ads out on
36:48 - the add them on your portfolio I think
36:50 - employers definitely want to see that
36:52 - and I can make your resume stand out
36:55 - thank you so much for sharing that
36:57 - Chelsea what would you add if anything
36:59 - yeah yeah the two things that come to
37:02 - mind the first more technical quantify
37:06 - quantify your experiences some of you
37:09 - say what does quantifying means you're
37:10 - telling a story by telling me the impact
37:13 - of every statement that you have for
37:15 - every role or responsibility leadership
37:18 - role internship that you've had just
37:21 - simply saying I'm a part of the
37:23 - marketing Club I send out social media I
37:26 - take care of all social media efforts
37:29 - you had to give me more information how
37:30 - many people are you reaching through
37:33 - social media how often are you posting
37:34 - what platforms are you using when you
37:37 - give an employer all that information
37:38 - they can really think about your impact
37:40 - they can think about all that you did to
37:42 - make a difference and so I want all of
37:45 - you to think about your resumes and make
37:46 - sure that you're telling strong stories
37:48 - the next thing is you want to make sure
37:50 - that your resume really speaks to who
37:53 - you are you want to be authentic I say
37:55 - it all the time never add anything on
37:57 - your resume just be very truthful to
38:01 - what you cook that's really a part of
38:03 - who you are because when it comes to the
38:04 - interview it's just gonna make that
38:06 - process a lot more easy because people
38:08 - will be using that as their guide to
38:09 - interview you I can remember my Wall
38:11 - Street days where there were
38:12 - some students who fluff their resume
38:15 - with hobbies and skills that I really
38:17 - care about and it came up in the
38:19 - interview and their response turned the
38:22 - interviewers off because it wasn't
38:23 - authentic and it completely you know
38:26 - messed up their chance of getting the
38:27 - internship so be yourself highlight your
38:30 - skills highlight your story and don't
38:33 - shy away from it because that's gonna be
38:35 - the competitive advantage that you have
38:36 - to stand apart from the rest I love that
38:40 - thank you so much that is sound advice
38:42 - and you know it's always important that
38:44 - you never add extra things to your
38:46 - resume that you don't need to add to
38:48 - your resume so thank you for
38:50 - double-clicking on that we have we're
38:54 - down to our last question and so it
38:58 - comes from Lance ET do you think the
39:00 - possibilities for international students
39:03 - would be lower if everything would be
39:06 - virtual to get sponsorship for work a
39:08 - work visa after graduation so that's a
39:11 - little bit of a curveball I don't know
39:12 - if either of you are prepared to think
39:14 - that's through a little bit but anything
39:15 - that you can say in support of our
39:17 - international students that would be
39:18 - helpful at this time we will take it and
39:20 - you know Chelsea I know you just spoke
39:22 - but why don't you jump in and tell us
39:24 - what you're thinking and then I'll ask
39:25 - Keanu to wrap up that final Q&A question
39:28 - yeah I mean the biggest thing I could
39:30 - say about inner international students
39:32 - so much of it is employer to employer
39:35 - sponsorship is very much employer to
39:37 - employer stay in the game that's the
39:41 - biggest thing I could say because and I
39:42 - think we talked about this earlier keep
39:44 - that hope keep that grind going keep
39:47 - those connections strong don't tap out
39:49 - because right now it's difficult and I
39:52 - want to acknowledge I understand the
39:54 - current the current situation okay it's
39:56 - something many people are very aware of
39:58 - and so you want to be mindful of what
40:03 - where we are now but understand in the
40:04 - fall things can shift dramatically so
40:07 - you want to be ready right you want to
40:08 - continue to connect with people you want
40:10 - to continue to build your story and your
40:12 - marketing materials your resume your
40:15 - cover letter your LinkedIn and you want
40:17 - to explore all options I'll end at this
40:19 - point sometimes we have one particular
40:21 - lens or pathway that we think is B
40:24 - pathway but
40:26 - we were talking earlier it was brought
40:28 - up up work I believe I'm piano Matthew
40:29 - mentioned up work or five or any of
40:31 - these freelancing opportunities
40:33 - you gotta work the skill if you have a
40:36 - skill that skill can be leveraged at a
40:38 - company it can be leveraged at a
40:40 - non-profit it can be leveraged for small
40:42 - business for a freelancer themselves
40:45 - think about your skill and how that can
40:47 - be used in the marketplace and I believe
40:49 - that that will help you advance in your
40:51 - early career days see thank you so much
40:54 - for that keyonna what advice do you have
40:56 - for international students my voice is
41:00 - very similar to keep the grind going
41:02 - keep your relationships that you have
41:04 - and keep on working on yourself because
41:07 - as Chelsea mentioned you never know
41:08 - what's going to happen one thing I
41:10 - didn't mention in the last question and
41:12 - this goes to all students is your skills
41:17 - that you're building definitely feel
41:18 - free to add those especially if they're
41:20 - like concrete visual skills for our
41:22 - technical folks are creatives out there
41:25 - if you have a github or project you've
41:27 - been working on definitely add that to
41:30 - your portfolio I know from my sister
41:32 - that's one example she does graphic
41:34 - design and it's been hard for her to
41:36 - find an opportunity so definitely for
41:39 - her I'm not encouraging her to keep on
41:41 - working on your portfolio you want to
41:43 - continue working on typography this is
41:46 - the time to do it you know start
41:47 - watching videos staying connected with
41:49 - folks and adding whatever you're
41:52 - building or you're learning put it on
41:54 - your your resume you can create your own
41:56 - website now and a lot of those are free
41:58 - now so those are some things I would
42:00 - keep in mind and as Chelsea mentioned
42:02 - keep the connections going you never
42:04 - know what can happen and what is next to
42:07 - come so I would say one thing with that
42:10 - is follow up is so important I feel like
42:12 - people reach out to me and we have a
42:14 - great conversation but I don't here for
42:16 - them
42:16 - I don't hear from them for like months
42:18 - or never at all so I think it's
42:20 - important to follow up especially during
42:22 - this time you can send a brief message
42:24 - to someone who you looked up to or
42:26 - someone whom you haven't spoken to in a
42:27 - while but you really admired go for it
42:29 - and just saying hey I've been thinking
42:31 - about you and I enjoyed your
42:33 - conversation that we had about XYZ I'd
42:36 - love to check in I'd love to follow up I
42:38 - love when students I've worked
42:40 - from the past they give me an overview
42:41 - on like what they've been working on or
42:44 - like what's happening or and update a
42:46 - life update I love that because I never
42:48 - know you never know when an opportunity
42:50 - can come up and like hey I just had that
42:52 - conversation with Alex let me hook him
42:54 - up or let me share this opportunity with
42:56 - him and may I just add one more man add
43:01 - something really quickly because I think
43:04 - that piece about follow up is so
43:06 - essential even if that's the one thing
43:07 - that you take away from today I just I
43:09 - have to speak to that because I'll give
43:12 - a very out of a quick example a week ago
43:15 - a similar webinar it was a global
43:17 - webinar so we had about 800 students on
43:20 - we had 100 come to LinkedIn and connect
43:23 - with us on LinkedIn but I had two who
43:25 - found my email they found my email
43:27 - someway somehow they found the email and
43:29 - they were the only two of 850 who
43:32 - actually went that far they took it one
43:34 - step further to send an email to connect
43:38 - we're busy but we make time for
43:40 - persistent persistent
43:42 - I'm the students and professionals
43:44 - what's my point those two students
43:45 - emailed me
43:46 - I didn't initially respond they followed
43:48 - up and I said about 45 minutes to speak
43:50 - with both of them and now like we're
43:51 - connecting them to different resources
43:53 - stay committed and consistent please
43:56 - when use when you don't hear from
43:57 - someone don't think that means they're
44:00 - not interested in speaking with you
44:01 - people have a million and one things
44:02 - that they're doing but your persistency
44:05 - and patients at the same time are really
44:08 - important to make sure that you keep the
44:09 - connection strong I love that story 800
44:15 - but two who followed up and then
44:16 - followed up again because you can get
44:18 - back to them right away and then you
44:20 - were able to connect them I love that
44:21 - our networks are so vital and so
44:24 - remember our sisterhood is also this
44:26 - network the fact that both of you have
44:28 - made yourselves available tonight you
44:30 - will as we talked about here from our
44:33 - very diligent resilient persistent alums
44:37 - and other women who are in our network
44:39 - so look out for those and I just
44:41 - encourage our network to realize and
44:42 - sort of soak in all of this wisdom
44:44 - around follow-up and the network because
44:47 - it's such a powerful thing I want to
