01:08 - part of the icebreaker and intros and i
01:10 - think i have something here that
01:12 - um we can do some icebreaker let's just
01:14 - introduce yourself
01:16 - your name title who you work for
01:19 - and then um what's a piece of media that
01:22 - you found
01:23 - really influential like a book a podcast
01:28 - a ted talk you know um who would like to
01:31 - go first
01:33 - i'll go ahead great um so i'm kelly
01:36 - lanco
01:37 - i do work for prudential financial i've
01:39 - been there for 30 years i did not start
01:41 - in it i actually started on the business
01:43 - side
01:44 - and kind of moved over to it about 22
01:47 - years ago
01:48 - i'm in information security so i
01:50 - actually grew up with the field
01:52 - um so i have i can tell you how it's
01:55 - really evolved i can tell you
01:57 - actually it's moving so quickly that
02:00 - we're seeing such
02:01 - change in the last two years that we've
02:04 - seen
02:05 - over time in 10 years so that's quick
02:07 - that's how quickly
02:09 - things are evolving um and i will say so
02:12 - given as much time that we put into work
02:14 - and being moms and everything else
02:16 - it is very difficult to actually sit
02:18 - down with a book and read
02:20 - i do try to do ted talks during my lunch
02:21 - break just to have that
02:23 - break from the computer and the
02:25 - conference calls
02:26 - so the ted talks i kind of listen to any
02:28 - more motivational kind of ted talks
02:30 - but i do um found that rollout
02:34 - actually was a really good book that i
02:36 - found very interesting is a really good
02:38 - read it talks about leadership but it
02:39 - really talks about
02:40 - safe agile which is really where the
02:43 - industry is going with their development
02:45 - um and then how and i can talk a little
02:47 - bit about how we actually embed
02:48 - information security into that
02:50 - um but it's really 12-week sprints and
02:53 - it's kind of like if you develop you
02:55 - test you go to production and it's just
02:56 - like
02:57 - you know quickly um you have a whole
02:59 - team of all your
03:00 - testers your planning everything at the
03:03 - table doing all the planning including
03:05 - information security which is awesome
03:07 - um and it's kind of like a team of folks
03:09 - they're doing the planning they're doing
03:10 - the programming and they're going right
03:12 - straight to production so um the safe
03:14 - rollout actually because it was such a
03:16 - change
03:17 - from what we're used to from a waterfall
03:19 - methodology
03:21 - to this new agile approach it i found it
03:23 - very inspiring
03:24 - and actually i find the whole approach
03:26 - very motivating so
03:29 - i'm great thank you the agile approach
03:32 - sounds really interesting maybe later we
03:34 - can
03:34 - hear a little bit more about that great
03:37 - um
03:38 - abby would you like to go next sure yeah
03:40 - thanks guys so much for having us i'm
03:42 - excited to be here tonight
03:44 - um but yeah my name name's abby willis
03:45 - i'm an engineer on our cryptography team
03:47 - at walmart
03:48 - um i've been here for about three years
03:50 - and it is an exciting
03:52 - field to be in information security but
03:55 - um
03:56 - not but and to kelly's point it's
03:57 - constantly changing which
03:59 - means it's never boring which means it's
04:01 - a lot of fun um
04:03 - as far as the media there's one ted talk
04:06 - that i really do enjoy too
04:07 - it isn't even infosec specific but it's
04:10 - more talking about getting outside of
04:12 - your comfort zone because i think that's
04:13 - so important
04:14 - and it's such a challenge so um i think
04:17 - i can't pronounce her name so i'm sorry
04:19 - i'll
04:20 - butcher it but her name's you being
04:21 - zhang and it's called life begins at the
04:23 - end of your comfort zone
04:25 - that's one of my favorite ones
04:28 - i'm excited to be here thanks for having
04:29 - us again thank you abby
04:32 - mary sure hi
04:36 - my name is marid angela gutierrez
04:39 - i work at accenture i've been there
04:43 - for four and a half years almost five i
04:46 - work
04:46 - as a security analyst a security
04:49 - consultant
04:50 - cyber security consultant whichever use
04:53 - you prefer uh
04:56 - i love to to be able to challenge
05:00 - uh to tackle many challenges for
05:02 - different clients
05:04 - so that is the part of the work that i
05:07 - love
05:07 - it's always changing depending in the
05:10 - industry depending on
05:11 - compliance which are the rules or
05:15 - regulations that
05:16 - the government or a certain institution
05:19 - provides them
05:21 - it's very exciting to see how each
05:24 - culture
05:24 - adapts to it and we have
05:28 - this approach as an accenture of
05:31 - security by design
05:33 - so nowadays we add a security person to
05:37 - up
05:38 - to any project to provide the
05:40 - information the feedback that is needed
05:43 - in order to have the security length
05:48 - from the very beginning and a piece of
05:51 - media that i
05:52 - love is a podcast
05:56 - how i build this i'm a fan of that
05:59 - podcast
06:00 - uh i've heard it from the very first
06:05 - episode and besides that i love
06:10 - hidden brain i love to learn a little
06:12 - bit
06:13 - more of how the brain works and how
06:17 - how we have all these biases so i love
06:20 - that
06:22 - that's wonderful i actually took some
06:23 - notes hidden brain i'm going to look
06:25 - that up
06:26 - thank you for sharing um
06:29 - you know i think maybe i think we can
06:31 - start off with
06:32 - learning more about ourselves um
06:36 - how about we start with some basics um
06:38 - what does your job
06:39 - title mean at your company
06:43 - and how do you spend your days
06:48 - who wants to go first
06:52 - how about we start yeah um so i'm
06:55 - actually i love this question because i
06:57 - remember when i was first kind of
06:59 - interested in security i was like
07:01 - okay but what do you actually do and i
07:03 - was so confused so i appreciate getting
07:05 - to know
07:06 - or you know people asking about that um
07:10 - i know it can vary a lot so i work in
07:13 - security engineering
07:14 - so there's a lot of different types of
07:16 - roles within security and you even see
07:18 - them represented here today but
07:20 - um so think of my role as more of a
07:22 - proactive defense type role
07:24 - um so i work every day on different
07:28 - products
07:28 - that have to do with encryption of
07:31 - different information
07:33 - um so that could mean you know
07:35 - engineering certain applications that
07:37 - could mean scripting that could mean
07:38 - automation
07:40 - but i also do a lot of work working with
07:43 - the other developers in our organization
07:45 - to
07:45 - help them understand how to actually put
07:47 - these things into use so we may offer
07:49 - these services but we help them
07:51 - understand
07:52 - how to use it so there's a lot of of
07:54 - different items that it could be and you
07:56 - kind of wear multiple hats
07:58 - in any role but that's that's kind of
08:00 - what i do
08:04 - thank you i'm actually taking notes abby
08:05 - this is exciting um
08:09 - uh mary sure so
08:13 - uh excuse me can you repeat the question
08:16 - sure the question is um
08:18 - what does your job title mean at your
08:21 - company
08:22 - and how do you spend your day or days
08:25 - perfect so uh my job
08:29 - uh title means i'm independent
08:32 - i'm more independent than an analyst
08:35 - or a senior analyst meaning
08:39 - um i i need to be proactive on
08:43 - to understand what are the needs of the
08:46 - team
08:47 - uh what are the next step
08:50 - in the project the managers overseas the
08:53 - project
08:54 - but as a consultant and the person who
08:57 - does the work more with the other
09:00 - consultants and analysts
09:03 - we we see it's
09:06 - like a team lead because as a consulta
09:10 - i already oversee uh two or three
09:13 - analysts
09:14 - or senior analysts to do the work
09:17 - that we are supposed to do um
09:22 - another thing is that as a consultant
09:25 - i need to think the needs of my manager
09:29 - before my manager
09:31 - thinks about them so uh to become
09:34 - like a mind reader but that comes with
09:37 - experience
09:38 - uh comes with a lot of
09:41 - uh being exposed to a lot of situations
09:46 - a lot of projects
09:47 - and in my day to day i start my day
09:50 - with a stand-up depending on the client
09:53 - some clients are steering waterfall like
09:55 - kelly mentioned
09:57 - or they are agile then i'll be in a
10:00 - stand-up
10:01 - i'll be part of the conversations of
10:04 - what needs to be done
10:06 - what the client needs for us what are
10:09 - the pending items that we need from the
10:11 - client in order to get our
10:13 - work done uh that is
10:17 - the main meet and greet of a consultant
10:20 - and understanding what is the problem
10:23 - and if we are
10:24 - focusing on the project from the right
10:27 - lens
10:29 - besides that as a consultant i also
10:31 - participate
10:32 - at in accenture activities so
10:35 - i have my plus one in my case is i run
10:39 - workshops for
10:40 - graduate code and accenture i think some
10:43 - of you have been there
10:45 - so i interact with the community
10:48 - and so on and finally at the end of the
10:51 - day
10:52 - uh we have um we talk with the client
10:56 - we make them understand where the
10:59 - their actual needs and to have clear
11:03 - estimates of
11:05 - how long will the project take
11:08 - that's great you know i'm i i came up
11:11 - with more
11:12 - some questions if you don't mind so
11:13 - essentially as a consultant
11:15 - it sounds like you're a subject matter
11:18 - expertise
11:20 - and as well as an advisory role it seems
11:23 - like
11:24 - exactly i i get multiple hats
11:28 - i have a little bit of project
11:30 - management
11:31 - as me a business analyst
11:35 - and advisor so all of them
11:39 - within one person oh wow but there are
11:42 - multiple people that do the same
11:44 - because we as ana during
11:48 - our analysis periods we were acquiring
11:51 - more of the technical knowledge uh
11:54 - a specific knowledge right and as we
11:58 - move up
11:59 - we should be able to provide more of the
12:03 - business background understand the pro
12:07 - the problem uh from
12:09 - [Music]
12:11 - from the business side as well as the
12:13 - technical side
12:14 - which are two different things oh wow
12:18 - so you opened up a lot of com the
12:21 - subject that actually
12:22 - raised even further more curiosities
12:24 - right i think all of us at some point
12:26 - have
12:27 - worked with consultants and mike i'm
12:29 - really curious as to um
12:31 - how much of your time is actually spent
12:33 - on like on-site with clients
12:36 - right and then prepping for
12:40 - the sessions so
12:43 - uh uh on clients
12:47 - prepping for the sessions is
12:50 - before the pandemic
12:53 - we used to go to the client from monday
12:55 - to thursday
12:57 - and uh start
13:00 - as early as eight in the morning and
13:03 - until
13:03 - five uh we usually use
13:06 - 25 of our time with the client
13:09 - in actual meetings and then the rest is
13:12 - doing the actual work
13:15 - in the other case as a manager you do
13:17 - more of
13:18 - more clients more meetings but in my
13:22 - case
13:23 - um i'm a person who wears a lot of hats
13:27 - also i i cannot be just focus on one
13:30 - thing i
13:31 - love to be involved in many things so
13:34 - i'm a
13:34 - big picture person so i'm always
13:38 - involved in different things
13:39 - within the fight wonderful thank you
13:42 - thank you
13:43 - um kelly
13:47 - yeah so oops can you hear me yeah okay
13:51 - yeah so it's interesting because
13:52 - actually accenture is one of our
13:54 - strategic partners i've been working
13:55 - very closely with our accenture partners
13:58 - um they are actually performing a lot
14:02 - so a lot of demand service a lot of our
14:04 - technology as well as operations
14:06 - um and part of that work is ensuring
14:08 - that we're setting them up with the
14:09 - right security
14:10 - controls but anyway just to back up so
14:12 - i'm a business information security
14:14 - officer which is great
14:15 - i think i get involved with everything
14:18 - or all aspects of information security
14:20 - i'm not an engineer i'm not an architect
14:22 - i'm not a propeller head
14:24 - um but i'm kind of right in between the
14:26 - business and
14:27 - our corporate you know information
14:28 - security office and i work with all of
14:31 - those um control partners or all of
14:33 - those expertise so
14:34 - um i have developed a lot of
14:36 - relationships i get to work with again
14:38 - our high-tech investigations units i
14:40 - work with
14:41 - our architects our engineers i work with
14:44 - all the
14:45 - the business so the product developers
14:47 - um and i'm
14:48 - i work very closely with the leadership
14:50 - teams on both technology and business
14:52 - and i kind of bring their strategies
14:54 - together and ensure that we're doing
14:56 - things in a secure fashion um so with
14:58 - that
14:59 - um i definitely get involved with a lot
15:00 - of the systems development life cycle
15:03 - um or sdlc um because in
15:07 - security has to be embedded right we're
15:09 - developing things
15:10 - security by design you hear privacy by
15:12 - design security by design
15:14 - um i also get involved again with all of
15:16 - the
15:17 - vendor relationships um companies today
15:21 - they have multiple third-party
15:22 - relationships
15:24 - so we have to ensure that when we're
15:26 - looking to engage in those
15:27 - um relationships that they have secure
15:30 - controls right if we're sending them
15:32 - data
15:32 - that they have the right security in
15:34 - place um so part and i'm gonna just kind
15:36 - of like
15:37 - kind of connect the dots here so what
15:39 - we're doing with accenture
15:41 - they want to bring in some of their own
15:44 - applications into prudential
15:47 - in order to support the engagement that
15:49 - they're performing for us so we're
15:51 - assessing the security of those
15:53 - applications
15:54 - um making sure that the right fit for
15:56 - prudential
15:58 - because we also have similar
16:00 - applications so if they're saying that
16:01 - they need
16:02 - something for time management we already
16:03 - have a time management tool
16:05 - so it's a lot of begin sitting with the
16:08 - enterprise
16:08 - architecture review board making sure
16:10 - their applications are the right fit
16:11 - making sure that they're coming in and
16:13 - um and not saying that they're
16:17 - in compliance with our security controls
16:20 - but that we're comfortable with the
16:21 - right controls based on the risk
16:24 - a lot of again what we do is risk
16:26 - management
16:27 - um so i'm i actually report directly to
16:31 - our chief
16:32 - information security officer so i'm
16:34 - embedded into the information security
16:36 - team
16:37 - but i work very closely with a lot of
16:39 - those partners um
16:41 - the other thing i do is i work with a
16:43 - lot of clients
16:44 - believe it or not so because i support
16:47 - institutional businesses we're a
16:49 - financial company and we support uh
16:51 - institutional business
16:52 - meaning the products that we offer that
16:55 - i'm supporting
16:56 - you're getting through your employer
16:58 - your 401k benefits your retirement
17:01 - benefits your
17:02 - insurance benefits from your employer so
17:05 - we call them institutional clients we
17:07 - deal with a lot of
17:08 - data but it's financial at the end of
17:10 - the day because again a 401k account is
17:12 - financial
17:13 - and related so our clients
17:16 - that we actually um that you know our
17:19 - clients also
17:20 - want to make sure that their data that
17:22 - they're sending to us is secure so
17:24 - um as much as winning a business
17:28 - a client wants to know that you're going
17:29 - to support their business needs they are
17:31 - so interested in cyber security and it
17:33 - really has exploded
17:35 - in the last couple of years so even to
17:37 - win a sale
17:39 - um a business sale you have to have a
17:41 - very strong
17:42 - um security program so i i find myself
17:45 - meeting
17:46 - um a lot with clients so i support that
17:48 - side as well
17:50 - um so there's very there's a lot of
17:52 - different aspects
17:54 - of a business information security
17:55 - officer and what we get involved with
17:58 - great thank you kelly now you use some
18:00 - several words that i like
18:01 - you know i actually put a question mark
18:03 - do you mind if i ask you some
18:05 - clarity right you use control partners
18:08 - right yes control partners is often
18:11 - referred to as your legal team your
18:13 - cyber law
18:14 - your privacy your compliance your risk
18:17 - management teams
18:18 - so they want to make sure you have the
18:19 - right controls based on their expertise
18:22 - embedded into either the product
18:23 - development the technology that you're
18:25 - building
18:26 - but it's really to support the business
18:28 - strategy um so i work very closely with
18:30 - those
18:31 - areas okay that's great and would you
18:34 - say um
18:35 - those control partners are also good
18:38 - entry
18:38 - into uh cyber security or information
18:41 - security
18:43 - i absolutely do so um if you even think
18:46 - about
18:47 - even since i've joined or i've started
18:49 - infinite security 22 years ago
18:52 - um there was no such thing as privacy
18:53 - officers right so we all kind of grew so
18:56 - even
18:56 - throughout that my time in my career
18:58 - privacy has now
18:59 - become a really big thing um so even if
19:02 - you started in
19:03 - privacy and as closely as you're working
19:05 - with your information security partners
19:07 - um you're learning right so it's a good
19:09 - segue into
19:10 - information security so risk management
19:13 - again is a big part of what we
19:14 - what i do you wouldn't put a um 100
19:18 - lock on a 10 bicycle right it's how you
19:20 - balance that risk when you're securing
19:22 - certain things wonderful and i think you
19:25 - touched on something that um
19:27 - i'm actually you know very intimate with
19:30 - not from
19:31 - technical expertise so big is something
19:33 - that we're
19:34 - sponsoring in our company as well which
19:36 - is
19:37 - sdlc and you use the word embedded and i
19:39 - think this is something that abby can
19:41 - also help us
19:42 - um understand what does that really mean
19:45 - so i mentioned
19:46 - um the same agile methodology that we're
19:48 - now using right 12-week sprints
19:50 - so what we have moved from and i'm
19:54 - going to try not to be too long so
19:55 - waterfall you wrote your requirements
19:57 - right you pro you then developed
19:59 - based on those requirements you tested
20:01 - those what you
20:02 - what you developed you have to get
20:04 - approvals before you know then you
20:06 - quality test then you went to production
20:07 - so it was very
20:09 - and that took a long time before any
20:11 - code got to your production
20:13 - today companies are trying to get there
20:15 - quicker very quickly they have to
20:17 - transform and they have to move to
20:18 - production very quickly they have to
20:20 - evolve
20:21 - especially if they're going to compete
20:22 - with startup companies and fintech
20:24 - companies
20:25 - um the large companies right now are
20:26 - going through a huge transformation
20:28 - so they've moved to this agile approach
20:31 - um so 12-week sprints
20:33 - so you have everyone at the table your
20:35 - developers your
20:37 - um whoever's writing your requirements
20:39 - your testers everyone at the table
20:42 - to do the planning so that they know
20:43 - what they have to do within that 12
20:44 - weeks and they're part of that planning
20:46 - process
20:46 - information security is also there right
20:49 - so
20:50 - and you have several different teams
20:52 - that may be part of what we call
20:54 - a program increment so you have
20:58 - teams because you're developing
21:00 - capabilities are like
21:02 - little pockets of code um and it really
21:05 - allows
21:06 - information security then to go from
21:08 - team to team and be there
21:10 - be present during the planning stages
21:12 - and during
21:13 - um those execution in those deep dive
21:16 - meetings
21:16 - so that we're helping them to solution
21:18 - right there and not have to wait till
21:20 - you get to production and then now you
21:22 - found you have a gap and you have to go
21:23 - back
21:24 - so it's kind of so when i say we're
21:26 - embedded right there we are definitely
21:28 - embedded now into the methodology of
21:31 - you know code development understood
21:33 - that's great
21:34 - thanks for expanding on that i'm sorry
21:38 - can i ask a question yeah absolutely
21:43 - i always wanted to meet someone like you
21:46 - because of the type of your job uh
21:49 - work i do so my biggest question is what
21:52 - is the biggest challenge
21:54 - in your day to day
21:58 - the biggest challenge is um trying to
22:00 - keep up with everything
22:02 - right um and because there's
22:06 - i guess so much work that is happening
22:09 - to so much transformation work you want
22:11 - you can't be in all places at the same
22:13 - time you can't be involved with every
22:15 - single project
22:16 - so what are those significant
22:18 - initiatives you have to make sure that
22:20 - you are
22:20 - networking that people know who you are
22:22 - that the proactive reaching out to you
22:25 - that is really key um so what we and
22:29 - so another thing that we've done
22:30 - obviously we're building automation into
22:32 - the devops pipeline
22:34 - so that you're kind of kept capturing
22:36 - those vulnerabilities and wherever you
22:38 - have
22:38 - you know code gaps before it even moves
22:41 - to production which helps
22:42 - and saves a lot of time um
22:45 - but you want to you want to make sure
22:47 - that again that the people
22:48 - still know that to come to you so we
22:50 - developed like almost like this really
22:53 - small little checklist say hey if you
22:55 - answer yesterday these questions make
22:56 - sure you're engaging us
22:58 - but my biggest fear is that we miss
23:01 - something right because again you can't
23:03 - be in all places at the same time
23:05 - absolutely absolutely awesome
23:08 - um i think that gets me thinking oh
23:11 - sorry
23:11 - go ahead um one of the things that i
23:14 - found most interesting when i started
23:15 - kind of getting interested in
23:16 - information security was um
23:19 - you'll hear the saying we have to be
23:21 - right every time
23:22 - and an adversary would only have to be
23:24 - right once and so
23:26 - it is kind of that pressure of are we
23:27 - missing things that absolutely you feel
23:29 - that
23:30 - at times especially in in technical role
23:33 - azure where you're really focused on
23:35 - prevention as
23:36 - well right um and i think there's that
23:38 - there's a lot of uh
23:40 - i don't know sort of uh trust and faith
23:43 - that that that
23:44 - the preventions that you recommend and
23:47 - and hopefully the other
23:48 - other others actually follow those
23:50 - recommendations as well
23:51 - right um yeah i think uh
23:55 - i think in my organization we have very
23:57 - similar challenges too
23:59 - as well um but like all of you all say
24:02 - it's ever evolving
24:03 - it's it's just it changes so fast
24:06 - and i think that's where the excitement
24:08 - about this industry is that whoever
24:10 - comes into this industry
24:12 - um there are many facets
24:15 - of this industry right like i think um
24:18 - when i first heard about cyber security
24:20 - and or
24:21 - information security many many moons ago
24:23 - i had a very
24:24 - narrow structure idea of what that is
24:27 - and when i look at the industry now my
24:30 - mind just goes oh my gosh
24:32 - you know there's so many different
24:34 - methods
24:35 - in which a talent can join an
24:38 - organization
24:40 - and actually function information
24:42 - security many ways
24:43 - right um and then i think
24:47 - that leads to like our next discussion i
24:48 - think that um i think
24:50 - uh a lot of our audience will be
24:52 - interested in it's
24:53 - really and i'd be i'm curious about this
24:56 - too
24:57 - right how did you get involved in this
24:59 - field
25:01 - right um and then um
25:06 - was your path through computer science
25:09 - um specific major you know so
25:12 - how did you get start and how did you
25:14 - land where you are
25:17 - oh sure i'll start since um
25:22 - so the path for me was
25:26 - more of mario flock as a student
25:30 - um i went to school to rochester
25:33 - institute of technology
25:35 - for computer science and there we have
25:37 - one year
25:39 - of co-ops so i
25:42 - interned at tons of reuters credit
25:44 - suisse
25:45 - uh another insurance company and after
25:49 - i i had these experiences i said
25:52 - i want to be in a place where
25:56 - where i have different projects where i
25:58 - don't need to be
26:00 - in the same project for five years or
26:03 - ten years
26:04 - which is what i saw among my colleagues
26:08 - in those places
26:10 - so i decided okay what is
26:13 - a place where i can learn more about
26:15 - technology and
26:18 - and still do software but still
26:22 - i want to learn more and i learned about
26:25 - consulting
26:26 - and i said but i don't want to be a
26:29 - business consultant i want to be a
26:31 - technical consultant and that's when i
26:34 - learn more about
26:35 - accenture and that they had that
26:38 - possibility
26:40 - and i because of my background
26:44 - doing research in mathematics
26:47 - in my school years my type of
26:50 - personality i
26:52 - fed i fit into the
26:56 - into the security practice so
26:59 - that was my luck and then
27:02 - that's how all this started that's great
27:05 - no i think um
27:06 - uh kelly i think you were saying
27:08 - something you're i think you're mute
27:11 - yeah i was telling my daughter to take
27:12 - their dog for a walk oh i'm sorry
27:16 - it's not good i gave my son a quick evil
27:19 - eye no not right now because he opened
27:21 - the door he's sort of here's your dinner
27:23 - mom like
27:24 - no not right now um all right um
27:28 - i forgot what i was going to say um
27:32 - well yeah so you know whenever i hear
27:35 - um a new story about how do you get
27:37 - involved in this field
27:38 - i'm really curious as to like um you
27:41 - mentioned the word intern
27:42 - mary right um
27:46 - how did you know like like when you
27:49 - interned
27:50 - um did you
27:53 - know that this was the sort of the want
27:56 - to get to
27:57 - no no as i said it was more
28:00 - i knew that i didn't want to stay in
28:03 - those companies and that i wanted a
28:05 - place where
28:06 - i could do different things but going
28:09 - into
28:10 - cyber security was more a matter of luck
28:14 - for me it turned out that was the
28:17 - practice i was assigned to
28:19 - and i started there at the beginning
28:23 - i didn't find my place and then
28:26 - everything
28:27 - connected and i and now i've been here
28:30 - for
28:31 - four years and a half that's a really
28:33 - good luck he ran into
28:35 - [Music]
28:36 - um avia i'm really curious to hear about
28:39 - your story
28:40 - yeah honestly i feel like there was luck
28:42 - playing in mine too so that's
28:44 - interesting
28:45 - um so i was a management information
28:48 - systems major
28:49 - which is a lot of times pretty well
28:51 - split of like business and technology
28:53 - but mine was
28:54 - definitely more business focused um but
28:57 - i got a couple internships with walmart
28:59 - um and they were full-time coding
29:00 - internships which in college
29:02 - i loved coding like thought it was super
29:05 - fun
29:06 - really enjoyed it and please don't hate
29:09 - me but when i got into the internship i
29:11 - realized i hated coding
29:14 - um and that was not for me so we all
29:15 - have different gifts and that's not mine
29:18 - but i know a lot of people love it and
29:19 - that's awesome um
29:21 - but when that happened i was like okay
29:23 - well if i don't want to be doing
29:25 - coding full time what are some of my
29:27 - other options and so
29:29 - during my internships i just kind of
29:31 - like met some other people within the
29:32 - organization which if you have
29:34 - internships i strongly encourage you to
29:36 - do that
29:38 - you know look around and see what other
29:39 - options are there
29:41 - um because it's the best opportunity for
29:44 - you to be able to do that so
29:46 - i ended up in information security and i
29:48 - was like y'all
29:49 - i know nothing about this my uh
29:51 - university at the time had no cyber
29:53 - security classes so i had no background
29:55 - at all
29:55 - um but i interviewed and i got a job and
29:58 - it was i mean it's been incredible so i
30:00 - started
30:00 - literally knowing nothing um
30:04 - but i found it super fascinating there
30:05 - are a lot of things i really enjoy about
30:07 - it but
30:08 - i think one thing that's unique about
30:09 - the industry in general is that
30:11 - we all really do want to work together i
30:13 - mean we all have the same goal we don't
30:14 - want to see each other fail
30:16 - um and i think that's a really unique
30:19 - field to be in and it's kind of fun um
30:23 - i loved i remembered when i was getting
30:25 - into it again kind of that like what do
30:27 - you guys
30:27 - actually do what are the options within
30:31 - cyber security because as you see here
30:33 - there's so much
30:34 - that you could even join and one of my
30:36 - favorite analogies which we probably
30:37 - don't have time for but if you're
30:38 - interested in it a lot of people talk
30:40 - about it is the castle analogy
30:42 - if you're kind of curious of what types
30:43 - of jobs there are i know when i talk to
30:45 - a lot of college students they think
30:47 - cyber security is pen testing and red
30:49 - team and that's all they really know
30:50 - about
30:51 - um which i completely understand um but
30:54 - there's so many different roles
30:56 - within information security there is
30:59 - coding if you enjoy that you can do
31:00 - full-time coding within infosec
31:03 - that's just not for me um but there are
31:06 - so many different roles and so many
31:08 - different
31:09 - um just job functions if you're
31:11 - interested and that's what i really
31:12 - enjoyed about it so
31:14 - um for me obviously i'm in um crypto
31:16 - it's something that
31:17 - i didn't know i was going to love but i
31:19 - ended up loving it
31:20 - um but it's just for me i stay in it
31:24 - because
31:24 - it's ever evolving and i didn't want to
31:26 - be bored and you will certainly never be
31:28 - bored
31:29 - in this industry um because of so much
31:32 - change and so much happening so
31:34 - um i kind of like got into it a weird
31:36 - way and
31:37 - um but i'm oh it will always be grateful
31:40 - for the people that gave me a job when i
31:42 - told them i know nothing but i can learn
31:44 - um so it's been a great
31:46 - few years that's great um
31:50 - cali yeah so i
31:53 - started i actually went to catherine
31:55 - gibbs school um
31:57 - and at a katherine gibbs school i got a
31:59 - job with prudential and i started in the
32:01 - accounting department
32:04 - um so from accounting i i grew up into
32:07 - other areas of the business
32:09 - retirement was one of the businesses
32:11 - that i worked for but i was in the
32:14 - business i didn't do any technology work
32:16 - at all
32:17 - i um then moved into that i was very
32:20 - interested in technology actually
32:22 - actually
32:22 - um mentorship was huge and i paid
32:26 - attention and i worked
32:28 - i worked a lot of hours so i actually
32:30 - had a lot of my leaders take me under
32:32 - their wing and they knew that i had a
32:33 - huge
32:34 - interest in computers so um
32:37 - i had certain leaders and i had what
32:39 - actually really drove me to
32:41 - technology is as they were developing
32:44 - um back way in the day our workflow
32:47 - system they took me into a room and
32:48 - there was white boards
32:49 - all over the place and it was a design
32:51 - of that application
32:53 - um so i was so junior but yet
32:56 - they had you know they they really saw
32:58 - something in me
32:59 - and from there i went from the help desk
33:01 - and i kind of um
33:03 - again was a top performer there and then
33:05 - information security and i started
33:06 - informing security 22 years ago
33:08 - and at the time i joined i really
33:10 - thought that i was going to be doing
33:12 - security provisioning like something
33:14 - like granting and
33:15 - removing security access from
33:18 - applications
33:19 - but it wasn't i was placed into more of
33:21 - a project management role
33:23 - and in that role i got involved with
33:25 - every single project
33:27 - that there was in infamy security and
33:30 - again
33:31 - i just had leaders that took me under
33:33 - their wing
33:34 - and taught me everything um so i was
33:38 - able to really grow
33:39 - i will say that the the biggest um
33:42 - success
33:42 - is is soft skills right you can learn
33:45 - you can google you can read white papers
33:47 - you can get your certifications
33:49 - um understanding the base concepts
33:52 - um but the soft skills the networking
33:54 - the communication
33:56 - how to talk to leadership that really is
34:00 - really important and i kind of emphasize
34:02 - that just because the young generation
34:04 - with the social media
34:06 - um you know sometimes you don't stop
34:09 - with the
34:09 - acronyms when you're you're texting it's
34:12 - really really important to develop those
34:14 - strong communication skills
34:16 - we've had um individuals come in from
34:18 - college
34:20 - very very highly intelligent was really
34:22 - great in their field
34:23 - but we had to send them to classes to to
34:26 - learn how to
34:27 - basically write because of the young
34:30 - generation and being on their phones and
34:32 - everything's um really quick so that is
34:35 - um
34:36 - but that's if you can if you have those
34:39 - core skills
34:40 - and you're able um and you're able to
34:43 - you know
34:45 - obviously read technical papers you'll
34:47 - grow in the field sorry i have
34:49 - my daughter
34:53 - hold on one moment um you know talk
34:56 - about communications because i think
34:57 - that is really important to um
34:59 - share some experiences too and that is
35:02 - although this
35:02 - is this seems like a technical field
35:05 - that i find that especially in
35:07 - information security or cyber security
35:10 - being able to articulate the actual
35:14 - concepts and application takes a whole
35:18 - different level of command of the
35:19 - language
35:20 - and this as a foreigner that's something
35:22 - i get to really i'm sure they're married
35:24 - you get to also
35:25 - experience that right and to this day
35:30 - i still get my feedback improve your
35:32 - communication
35:33 - skills but i make up for that
35:36 - in other ways i present better i
35:41 - i try to be informed all the time
35:44 - i i'm always reading different things
35:47 - and i think that you hit a great point
35:51 - it's that communications and business
35:54 - skills
35:55 - are very important just because
36:01 - as a software engineer you are creating
36:04 - a piece of software that will be sale
36:07 - right but security is not monetized
36:11 - right you're not selling that product
36:15 - unless your software is a security
36:17 - product for another company
36:19 - so it's a matter of 100 of providing
36:24 - okay so in the case let's say of target
36:28 - when there was the hack how much money
36:31 - did that company
36:32 - lose because they didn't provide the
36:35 - right
36:35 - security uh
36:39 - environment right
36:42 - so we need to sell any
36:46 - any decision any security decision
36:49 - based on what are the needs
36:53 - and anticipate the constraints
36:56 - also of that and the budgets that
36:59 - security
37:00 - the security offices are given and i
37:03 - will
37:04 - lead leave the rest to kelly and av
37:08 - yeah that's a tough one um actually
37:11 - talking to leadership about the cost
37:12 - benefits of information security it's
37:15 - really hard to articulate because you
37:17 - can't
37:18 - you you don't know the financial loss
37:20 - that will happen you can only
37:21 - estimate right and you're not really um
37:24 - you're not bringing a business it's not
37:25 - sales so
37:26 - anything information security related
37:28 - that you're actually bringing in it's
37:30 - costing the business
37:31 - they don't want to spend money on
37:33 - anything that's going to other than a
37:34 - capability that's going to bring in
37:35 - business
37:37 - so it's really difficult and it's really
37:38 - challenging obviously i think the
37:40 - leadership teams across
37:42 - you know the industry now realize the
37:43 - importance of information security or
37:45 - cyber security
37:46 - um but it's definitely some tough
37:48 - conversations that you need to have to
37:50 - really articulate when you want to bring
37:52 - in a new tool application software
37:54 - um even um just uh you know hire even a
37:58 - new resource sometimes
38:00 - you know try to understand the work
38:02 - that's involved just because
38:03 - um it's not an area that leadership
38:05 - wants to put money towards right
38:07 - and now that you're bringing our
38:08 - leadership a thought comes to my mind
38:11 - about
38:11 - communication articulation is that i
38:13 - find that um
38:14 - the more senior we are in our
38:18 - um our positions the communication
38:21 - articulation becomes a lot more
38:23 - critical in lending that message even in
38:26 - our technologies i'm sure that abby
38:28 - you've
38:28 - experienced this too if you want to
38:29 - share some experiences
38:31 - i think that's really important to share
38:32 - with our audience who is um
38:34 - uh who would like to understand what it
38:36 - is that um they they
38:38 - they would like to focus more on or be
38:40 - able to look into
38:41 - and honing some of their skills right
38:45 - yeah i'll just add um it's another
38:47 - common term you'll hear if you're in the
38:48 - area
38:49 - or in the division um security is
38:52 - everyone's responsibility it isn't just
38:54 - an infosec
38:56 - so you not only have to get your
38:58 - leadership buy-in to support your
38:59 - organization but you also have to
39:01 - continue to get that buy-in
39:02 - of the rest of the people in the
39:04 - organization that have no connection
39:06 - to information security but it is for
39:09 - everyone so you do have to be able to
39:11 - communicate okay these are the reasons
39:13 - why
39:14 - um you know we have these policies in
39:15 - place and um here's how
39:17 - you know this impacts you and so having
39:20 - those skills is really important
39:22 - yeah and a thought comes from until like
39:24 - maybe that's why all of us sort of fell
39:25 - into it
39:27 - um you know and i i certainly have fell
39:29 - into it accidentally as well
39:31 - um as part of more of an audit team
39:35 - um and and uh
39:38 - just very interesting but then i did
39:40 - realize that it does
39:42 - take um that level of articulation
39:44 - skills that
39:46 - i had to develop as well but it comes
39:48 - naturally because you're surrounded by
39:50 - folks who are very
39:50 - articulate in this industry right so
39:53 - this is great
39:54 - i think that listen to um next set of
39:56 - really interesting questions
39:58 - um and this is something i think we all
40:01 - said in our introductions
40:02 - evolving ever changing etc so
40:06 - um how do you anticipate the field of
40:09 - cyber security information security
40:11 - changing over time
40:12 - perhaps you can expand upon some of your
40:15 - observations that's taking now and share
40:17 - with
40:18 - everyone um abby would you like to
40:24 - sure um that's difficult because there's
40:27 - so many things
40:28 - um it it constantly changes
40:32 - as you know different things happen and
40:35 - different
40:35 - technologies advance there's constant
40:37 - change i will
40:39 - i will mention one technology that you
40:41 - see a lot of discussion around right now
40:44 - is iot there is a lot of discussion in
40:47 - the industry about
40:48 - okay what this is and how do we protect
40:50 - this and um
40:52 - i clear i'm referencing a lot of um
40:54 - phrases but
40:55 - one of the funny jokes people say is the
40:57 - s in iot stands for security
40:59 - um and so um it's a challenge
41:03 - about how we approach this you if you
41:06 - google it you will see a number of
41:07 - different companies that have gotten
41:09 - bitten
41:10 - gotten bit by um you know having some
41:12 - iot devices that ended up being an
41:14 - access point for
41:15 - an adversary um like i think there was a
41:17 - fish tank monitor
41:19 - that someone used one time and that's
41:21 - how they got entrance to their
41:22 - network so um iot is a big discussion
41:25 - right now if you're just
41:26 - thinking about one technology in
41:28 - specific that um
41:30 - you know people really have their eyes
41:31 - on and will be a focus point i think for
41:34 - a lot of the industry
41:37 - right mary or kelly would you like to
41:41 - also contribute to that question about
41:43 - how do you anticipate
41:45 - this field um changing over time
41:53 - in my case i believe that
41:56 - [Music]
41:58 - it is changing by the day it's not
42:02 - changing by the month it's changing by
42:05 - the day
42:06 - this pandemic has really precipitated
42:09 - all those changes and technologies that
42:12 - where as
42:13 - we were expecting in 10 years or five
42:15 - years from now
42:17 - those are coming now because of the need
42:20 - for different companies to
42:24 - stay afloat or to to innovate
42:29 - and to help other people even in terms
42:32 - of
42:32 - um creating the vaccine they had to use
42:36 - super computers to to come up with
42:40 - all the algorithms and all the data
42:42 - create all of that
42:44 - so understanding that the only
42:48 - uh the only thing that will
42:51 - stay there it's you and your
42:55 - instincts to create a more secure world
42:59 - world is is the only thing that will
43:02 - stay with you
43:04 - but technologies will change
43:07 - [Music]
43:08 - everything will change so your ability
43:12 - to problem solve
43:14 - is the thing that will stay actually
43:20 - yeah i think from a pure technology
43:22 - standpoint to where
43:23 - where i think see things changing again
43:26 - the transformation
43:28 - um you have so many of these startup
43:30 - companies and they're able to build
43:32 - their technology right from the start
43:34 - you don't need the overhead right so
43:36 - they don't have the overhead of people
43:38 - um it's truly in a lot of it's
43:41 - automation you know putting whatever
43:43 - they can put into the devops environment
43:45 - to automate
43:46 - the um you know the code movement
43:49 - looking at the code for quality
43:51 - um and security vulnerabilities even
43:53 - before it even gets to production
43:55 - um development is like in almost like
43:57 - cubes it's almost like building blocks
43:59 - instead of
44:00 - you know programming um you know
44:03 - you know doing tons like all the
44:05 - programming and then you just add on to
44:07 - the program then it's a band-aid here
44:08 - and a band-aid there and that's kind of
44:10 - just how it was in the past
44:12 - um you really truly have you know you're
44:13 - moving really quickly to the cloud you
44:16 - are using services um that the cloud
44:19 - providers are offering
44:21 - so it's very coding has become very
44:23 - simplistic
44:24 - um but the movement is so quick
44:28 - right so how do you ensure that you as
44:30 - quickly as things are moving that you
44:32 - don't
44:32 - have security vulnerabilities also go in
44:34 - there from an
44:36 - industry standpoint i could tell you
44:37 - that there's a lot of regulations that
44:39 - are popping up
44:40 - and i work with a lot of the regulators
44:42 - um so we had a lot of the privacy
44:45 - from state to state now you're starting
44:47 - to see the cyber security ranks um
44:49 - new york department of financial
44:50 - services you had the dol that was just
44:52 - issued in the last two
44:54 - weeks um and
44:57 - you have to certify like these cios um
45:00 - csos of these companies have to certify
45:02 - to these federal regulators
45:04 - the strength of their cyber security
45:05 - programs so
45:07 - and again to comply cost money um and
45:09 - then balancing it with the business need
45:11 - and and the business strategy and as
45:13 - quickly as their
45:14 - as we're moving right um it's just it is
45:18 - a huge
45:19 - um challenge to keep up with all of that
45:22 - uh
45:22 - movement um so tons of regulations
45:25 - popping up
45:26 - um speed to market um
45:30 - you know agility um and so that's
45:33 - kind of that's where i'm starting to see
45:36 - a lot of change
45:37 - sounds like it's just constantly
45:39 - changing
45:41 - if you enjoy change and challenges this
45:44 - is it
45:45 - yeah i mean even from you know moving to
45:47 - a zero trust network right you always
45:48 - you always manage the external threats
45:50 - now you have to manage it from
45:51 - internal because you're doing so much
45:53 - business with um
45:55 - you know strategic partners that you
45:56 - don't really have that base of employees
45:58 - anymore you have a lot of consultants
45:59 - that are helping
46:00 - so it's um and moving away from data
46:03 - centers
46:03 - so that you're now that somebody can
46:06 - just log in and
46:07 - um and access a business application
46:10 - without it
46:10 - actually being within your own data
46:12 - center it's either on a cloud
46:14 - or you're putting security firewalls in
46:16 - place so they can access it from any
46:17 - device
46:18 - so again very quick movement in these
46:21 - areas
46:23 - wow um you mentioned
46:26 - data centers right could you
46:30 - expand on why you use that you know
46:33 - to help us explain data center
46:36 - security versus cloud security i'm more
46:40 - thinking from how can our audience
46:42 - um and relate to that versus cloud
46:46 - yes right um because like i i could i
46:49 - could understand that but when i think
46:51 - about more of our audience
46:52 - um you know how would they be applying
46:55 - this information to find more more data
46:59 - to see
47:00 - how they could be searching for these
47:03 - type of opportunities
47:04 - right and and companies are moving away
47:06 - from data centers
47:08 - because they're very costly so um
47:12 - so certainly you have your your network
47:14 - and everything was contained within your
47:16 - network and you
47:17 - were able to monitor that network now
47:19 - it's extended
47:20 - um to cloud right so your cloud your
47:23 - it's like a private cloud is an
47:24 - extension of your network so you're
47:26 - you're monitoring all of that traffic
47:29 - certainly your cloud provider might be
47:31 - you know responsible for the core
47:33 - infrastructure
47:35 - but as you're putting data and
47:36 - applications out there you have to be
47:38 - responsible for monitoring that traffic
47:40 - you have to be
47:41 - responsible for monitoring to make sure
47:42 - you're still not imp you're not
47:44 - um implementing code with
47:47 - vulnerabilities so
47:48 - the same controls that we had actually
47:50 - on we've moved into the cloud and we
47:53 - utilize the services that the the cloud
47:55 - providers
47:56 - um do offer to simplify that monitoring
48:00 - so it's really built-in services that
48:02 - cloud already offers
48:04 - versus the um pretty much customized
48:08 - services a lot of
48:09 - these uh on-prem services provide i
48:12 - think that's probably the
48:13 - expected differences maybe you know
48:16 - it provides more data than how our
48:19 - audience can do more research
48:21 - yeah and it's a lot and it's very um
48:25 - cost it's more cost effective for
48:27 - companies to purchase what they call
48:29 - software as a service
48:30 - right so those those software programs
48:32 - are also
48:33 - built on their cloud provider so you
48:36 - have
48:37 - different apps and that's why i said
48:38 - you're moving away from your core data
48:40 - centers because
48:41 - it's just cheaper to purchase an
48:43 - application that's already out there
48:44 - supported by somebody else
48:45 - obviously you have your data you have to
48:47 - make sure it's secure you're monitoring
48:49 - that
48:49 - your your associates need to access it
48:52 - but there
48:53 - so now you have to apply security on
48:56 - um being able to from again
49:00 - or um you know move again working from
49:02 - home because of covid right so
49:04 - how can how can they be able to access a
49:07 - business application from any device a
49:09 - personal
49:10 - business device in a secure fashion
49:14 - yeah wonderful a lot going on yes
49:17 - yes um another thought came to my mind
49:21 - is you know with a focus on
49:24 - um bring more awareness and how
49:28 - how to find more opportunities in this
49:30 - in this industry
49:32 - what kind of experience
49:35 - do you expect or hope to see
49:39 - from uh folks who's looking for this
49:42 - type of opportunity
49:43 - whether it be college grads or someone
49:44 - who's switching from another you know
49:46 - job to cyber security what would be the
49:49 - type of
49:50 - um experience would you expect or hope
49:53 - to see
49:56 - i'll add really quickly to this one i
49:57 - know we have just like a minute or two
49:59 - left but
50:00 - um what we tend to look for isn't
50:02 - necessarily tons of experience because
50:04 - to
50:04 - what's been discussed already we can
50:07 - teach you the technology
50:08 - um but do you have those skills to be
50:10 - able to go learn it
50:12 - and apply it and communicate it when you
50:14 - need it so
50:15 - any type of project that you have that
50:17 - you can speak to
50:18 - you know intelligently like this is what
50:20 - i did i built this application and they
50:22 - have nothing to do with security
50:24 - but if you can speak to it and the
50:25 - choices that you made
50:27 - that's really what we tend to look for
50:30 - um
50:30 - i will also say i'll let them add
50:32 - something if they want but feel free to
50:33 - reach out to me if you want um i'm happy
50:35 - to talk to you about some entry-level
50:37 - jobs or different types of
50:38 - um jobs within the field because i know
50:41 - there's
50:42 - it's kind of weird when you talk about
50:43 - it like okay what does it mean to be in
50:45 - network security and what does it mean
50:46 - to do all these types of things and
50:48 - where do you start um i'm more than
50:50 - happy to help but
50:51 - yeah wonderful thank you
50:55 - i think it's important to understand
50:57 - what because there are so many different
50:59 - niches of infamous security
51:01 - um there is even cyber psychologists
51:05 - right so there's just so many different
51:06 - aspects of the field is being
51:08 - understanding where you want to narrow
51:10 - that down and then where do you focus
51:11 - your education or those requirements
51:13 - from my standpoint and working like
51:16 - within the biso team
51:17 - um if you understand at a high level of
51:19 - different security domains access
51:21 - controls logging
51:22 - and and so forth the rest is teachable
51:25 - right it's really those soft skills that
51:27 - we really do look for
51:28 - being able to communicate between your
51:30 - technology partners and your business
51:31 - partners being able to listen to what
51:33 - your business partners are looking for
51:35 - and then how do you solve for that
51:37 - um and how do you articulate you know
51:39 - risk
51:40 - up to your to your leadership teams or
51:42 - even to your manager right if you see
51:44 - something at risk how do you how do you
51:46 - bring that to their attention in a
51:47 - timely fashion
51:49 - thank you mary so
51:52 - uh i said that what
51:56 - the cyber security world needs right now
51:58 - it's
51:59 - a different different perspective
52:02 - uh so an english mayor a
52:06 - biology major are qualified
52:11 - just because they have the analytical
52:14 - skills or the communication skills
52:17 - to succeed in different areas
52:20 - so it's not it's not
52:25 - it's not that only computer scientists
52:27 - can go into this field
52:28 - but there is a need for different type
52:31 - of
52:32 - thinking and approaching problems so
52:35 - that we can actually solve
52:38 - the problems that exist because
52:41 - a hacker doesn't necessarily have a
52:44 - degree
52:47 - for anyone that's a great point
52:52 - great well thank you um
52:57 - thank you all for joining i think that
52:58 - was our very last session
53:01 - thank you thank you for inviting me
53:04 - thank you guys so much for joining us
53:06 - we're so
53:07 - um it was so interesting and it was so
53:09 - much information
53:11 - um i know i really enjoyed it um i want
53:13 - to thank our panelists you are fantastic
53:16 - i want to thank our alumni for joining
53:18 - us this evening
53:19 - if you guys want to take your camera
53:22 - camera phone out and take a
53:24 - a quick screen grab of the of our qr
53:27 - code tonight and there's a quick survey
53:29 - it takes less than a minute to complete
53:31 - if you don't mind
53:33 - i'm filling that out for us it'll help
53:34 - us determine what our upcoming topics
53:36 - might be
53:37 - thank you so much and have a wonderful
53:40 - evening
54:04 - i think we're done what do you think
54:09 - i think we just log off mary i think
54:11 - that's what's
54:12 - happening i didn't ask how we end this
54:14 - session
54:15 - thank you guys so much that was
54:16 - fantastic oh my god
54:19 - i i wish we could do a lot more deep
54:20 - dive but that was really fun
54:22 - that was fun it was meeting you all
54:25 - likewise
54:29 - bye
