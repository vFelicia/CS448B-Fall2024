00:00 - [Music]
00:01 - i think it's important for more women to
00:03 - be involved in tech fields because
00:05 - having that representation a different
00:07 - perspective is something important in
00:10 - the world in any career
00:12 - i thought i was interested in tech field
00:13 - but i wasn't so sure in high school we
00:15 - didn't have a lot of tech courses so i
00:18 - was looking for outside resources
00:21 - we know that jobs in tech are the
00:24 - highest paying fastest growing in our
00:26 - country and frankly around the world if
00:28 - women are left behind then that's a
00:31 - world of economic opportunity that
00:32 - they're being denied for themselves and
00:34 - for their families and we know that that
00:36 - has to change
00:38 - [Music]
00:42 - at girls who code we're on a mission to
00:44 - close a gender gap in tech and to change
00:46 - the image of what a computer programmer
00:48 - looks like and does we work with girls
00:50 - across the country and now
00:52 - internationally who have come from
00:54 - communities that are historically
00:55 - underrepresented girls of color black
00:58 - and latina and from low-income
01:01 - households and girls who code absolutely
01:04 - gives them that confidence and pride and
01:06 - convinces them that they can do anything
01:14 - you're learning computer science every
01:16 - day you get to see how people work you
01:18 - have guest speakers who are these
01:19 - powerful women in tech who come in and
01:21 - talk to you you get to go on field trips
01:23 - and see how tech changes lives i cannot
01:25 - think of a better experience and that's
01:27 - what we give girls through girls who
01:28 - code programming
01:29 - it's also about the sisterhood the
01:32 - confidence the bravery
01:34 - a lot of what people call soft skills
01:36 - that are critical to them persisting in
01:38 - the field we're definitely going in a
01:41 - really positive direction for women in
01:43 - tech fields especially with programs
01:46 - that do form camaraderie between women
01:48 - it's really great to have that kind of
01:50 - teamwork so that they can pursue those
01:53 - aspirations without feeling like they're
01:55 - alone
01:56 - girls who code is making a tremendous
01:59 - impact in the communities that we serve
02:01 - girls get a chance to see themselves as
02:04 - technologists and they can bring those
02:05 - resources back to their communities and
02:07 - make a change
02:08 - yeah you're going to encounter difficult
02:10 - problems and it's okay to even fail
02:12 - sometimes as long as you did stick
02:15 - through it you have succeeded
02:18 - [Music]
02:24 - you
