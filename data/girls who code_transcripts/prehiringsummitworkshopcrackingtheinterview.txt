04:37 - everyone thank you all for joining us
04:40 - this evening let's go ahead and jump
04:42 - into our
04:45 - discussion um so the first thing I'm
04:48 - going to ask is um well it's generally
04:51 - considered good advice to research the
04:53 - company and requirements of the job
04:54 - you're inter interviewing for in advance
04:57 - but what specific information should
04:59 - candidates focus on um and Dave I think
05:02 - I'll go to you first with that yeah um
05:05 - so from my perspective obviously I run
05:07 - recruiting at bit site um so there's a
05:10 - couple different things that can kind of
05:13 - pile up on top of each other when it
05:15 - comes to like later on in the interview
05:16 - process that you can kind of pull from
05:18 - in the actual kind of research of the
05:20 - company but I would say some of the
05:22 - biggest important factors would be like
05:25 - understanding kind of what the values of
05:27 - the company are um so at bitsight for
05:29 - instance um about a year ago now we
05:32 - rolled out structured interviewing um to
05:34 - try our best to kind of pull out on
05:37 - unconscious bias um and part of that is
05:41 - we've kind of tailored questions around
05:42 - our core values um and our core values
05:45 - are actually on our website um so that's
05:47 - something candidates can see um and then
05:52 - um just understanding also kind of the
05:55 - value proposition of of the company and
05:57 - and the product itself because as a
05:59 - recruiter when I talk to candidates I
06:01 - give a 10,000 foot view um but at the
06:04 - same time I want to go into the
06:05 - conversation with an understanding the
06:07 - candidates have done at least at least
06:09 - look to the website um just because at
06:12 - the end of the day a lot of candidates
06:14 - uh right now are applying to jobs and
06:16 - there are a lot of people I talk to on a
06:18 - regular basis so what sets candidates
06:20 - apart are showing that they actually
06:21 - kind of care about the job and um aren't
06:23 - just kind of applying to jobs just for
06:26 - um just for a
06:28 - job
06:30 - great answer and Dave actually touched
06:32 - on um something that I'd like to follow
06:34 - up with um for the rest of you um where
06:37 - do you find the information um that
06:40 - candidates should focus on and Dave
06:42 - mentioned like the core values on the
06:44 - website and just exploring the job but
06:46 - if you guys could all touch on that too
06:48 - a little bit that'd be great yeah so um
06:50 - glass door is another big one as well um
06:53 - you can tell a lot about a company based
06:55 - on um kind of reviews um obviously take
06:57 - with the grant of salt um I I think a
07:00 - lot of times glass door it can be the
07:02 - two extremes can be people that love
07:03 - their company or people that absolutely
07:05 - hate something and a lot of times it's
07:07 - not the middle ground but I think it
07:08 - still gives you some
07:11 - insight I can add to that really quickly
07:15 - um for everyone on the call is some sort
07:18 - of a technologist right or aiming to be
07:20 - one and not all companies have the best
07:24 - website right and maybe they you know
07:26 - from a design or branding standpoint
07:29 - it's a great place to start in terms of
07:32 - research but I also think that you know
07:34 - looking at employees of the companies on
07:37 - LinkedIn their Pages the posts that they
07:40 - choose um to post about whatever the
07:43 - content is that they're posting or the
07:45 - company page on LinkedIn itself um again
07:49 - it's about gaining Traction in the
07:50 - market with candidates and um making
07:53 - sure that your brand is reputable and I
07:56 - mean I have some feedback about our own
07:58 - website so I'm not here to knock anyone
08:00 - else except for uh put myself at the
08:02 - Forefront of that but um you know we try
08:05 - to do a good job as a company of saying
08:08 - hey our values are X on our website and
08:11 - the posts uh that we have on LinkedIn
08:14 - showcase those values either through
08:16 - engagement initiatives or how we
08:18 - recognize and highlight employees so
08:21 - that's just another place that you can
08:23 - um capture some of that information as
08:24 - you're prepping for
08:26 - interviews and just a piggyback really
08:29 - quick um because you made a really good
08:31 - point I think PNC also is very active in
08:34 - their corporate uh LinkedIn that's a
08:37 - really good way to also see the company
08:39 - culture what you expect kind of out of
08:43 - how it works in the workplace um if they
08:46 - have a large Market presence um if
08:49 - you're in person or you're virtual um if
08:52 - they have fun events if they're in the
08:54 - community um so yeah I think like she
08:57 - said like what everyone said so far the
09:01 - website your the company's website is
09:03 - probably your first stop and then social
09:05 - media um is a is really big now
09:08 - regardless of the kind of
09:10 - companies um just to kind of piggyback
09:13 - off of what everyone else has said
09:15 - definitely start off at the company
09:17 - website um you really want to focus in
09:19 - on the mission and the values but also
09:21 - look at like what are some of the cool
09:23 - things that the company is doing right
09:25 - now often times um the company
09:27 - highlights some of those things maybe
09:29 - there will be links to blog posts um
09:31 - news articles anything like that kind of
09:33 - highlighting like these are the trends
09:35 - that the company is investing and these
09:37 - are the things the company is passionate
09:39 - about right now and see if there's a way
09:41 - that you can kind of tie in your own
09:43 - personal interests or experience into
09:45 - that and that would be a really strong
09:47 - way to show that like you've done your
09:48 - research you're interested and um there
09:51 - is a possible match
09:55 - there great um before we move on to the
09:59 - the next question I just want to remind
10:00 - all of our um attendees that if you have
10:03 - any questions about anything that our
10:05 - panelists um have brought up while
10:07 - they're answering the questions feel
10:09 - free to drop those in the chat or the
10:10 - Q&A um just a reminder um that way you
10:14 - don't forget and you have to hold on
10:15 - till the end of the the webinar to to
10:18 - get your
10:19 - answer all right so let's move on um
10:24 - what do you think about researching your
10:27 - interviewer what is important
10:29 - um to know about the interviewer before
10:32 - you go into the interview and what do
10:34 - you think about connecting on LinkedIn
10:37 - with the interviewer before the
10:40 - interview um halai uh do you want to
10:42 - take this one first I'm so glad you
10:44 - called on me because I really wanted to
10:46 - answer this question and the reason was
10:50 - is
10:51 - because you really want a job whether
10:54 - that's just to ensure you have a steady
10:56 - income or because you really want to be
10:58 - a part of that company
11:00 - the interviewer and their role in the
11:02 - job process or the role that they have
11:04 - at the company that you're trying to
11:06 - join can tell you the most about um you
11:10 - know whether that job is even a fit for
11:12 - you and I think when you're researching
11:14 - the interviewer you want to know
11:16 - potentially if you can ask the recruiter
11:18 - this why that person is involved in the
11:20 - interview process like are they the
11:22 - hiring manager are they going to be your
11:24 - colleague and appear on your team that
11:28 - would like knowing those Basics about
11:30 - who the interviewer is and what role
11:32 - they play in the process is going to
11:34 - tell you a lot about what type of
11:36 - questions to ask them and give you
11:39 - Insight right because you're also there
11:40 - interviewing the company as much as
11:42 - they're interviewing you so um get to
11:45 - know who that interviewer is and like
11:48 - honestly how you can leverage them as
11:50 - giving you Intel for That interview or
11:53 - for future interviews so I honestly
11:55 - emphasize like researching the
11:57 - interviewer more than in researching the
12:00 - company because that person is also
12:01 - going to be your Advocate potentially
12:03 - down the line and so building Rapport
12:06 - and knowing them and asking them good
12:08 - questions is really
12:11 - helpful um to piggyback off that um I
12:14 - think another piece that's important is
12:17 - um evaluating the interviewers because
12:20 - seeing kind of where they came from so
12:21 - let's say you're interviewing for a job
12:23 - and it might not be one to one the same
12:25 - job you're um applying for that the
12:27 - person is in the seat of um but you can
12:29 - see their career progression um how long
12:31 - have they've been with the company
12:32 - that's a good sign for your career
12:33 - progression as well I know everyone here
12:36 - um is a little bit earlier in your
12:37 - career um so you can understand if the
12:39 - company does promote from within um and
12:42 - then um something I also do um or
12:46 - something I've done in the past when
12:47 - I've interviewed for jobs is um I've
12:49 - always asked to speak with peers um in
12:52 - the interview process um so a lot of the
12:55 - times if you're interviewing for like an
12:57 - engineering job or like a product
12:58 - management job you might meet with a lot
13:00 - of leadership folks uh but sometimes you
13:03 - want to meet someone that is in your
13:04 - seat today because you want to get their
13:06 - perspective as
13:10 - well I think that that's honestly all
13:13 - really great advice and um I I totally
13:16 - stand by you know doing a research on
13:19 - the interviewer prior to the interview I
13:22 - think it definitely helps in terms of um
13:24 - guiding the conversation as well um if
13:27 - you have some insight into who your
13:29 - interviewer is ahead of time um you
13:32 - might be able to kind of pre-plan some
13:34 - questions that um would be beneficial to
13:36 - kind of guiding the conversation and
13:38 - really showcasing your interest so for
13:40 - example if the interviewer is on a
13:42 - specific team that might be of interest
13:44 - to you within the company um it's a
13:46 - really good way to kind of get some
13:48 - nuggets of knowledge in terms of um what
13:51 - that team does and and really show your
13:53 - passion and interest in that and even if
13:55 - it's not it's also a cool opportunity to
13:57 - be like what other options or
13:59 - opportunities are there so um maybe if
14:02 - you aren't the right fit for that team
14:04 - it doesn't mean you aren't a fit for the
14:06 - company and you might be able to like
14:07 - explore other opportunities in that way
14:10 - um so that's always something super um
14:12 - super um important to do and also
14:16 - thinking about um your questions ahead
14:19 - of time is is super helpful as well um
14:22 - you don't want to kind of go all in
14:24 - being like Oh I stocked your page and I
14:26 - know all of this about you um but if the
14:28 - interviewer you know is is bringing up
14:31 - things about like their experience and
14:32 - their background it would help if you
14:34 - have some questions that align with um
14:36 - what you're hoping to get out of the
14:37 - conversation maybe your interviewer has
14:39 - had a similar career path to you and you
14:41 - can get some um Insight or advice in
14:44 - terms of how you could kind of guide
14:46 - your own career path as
14:49 - well so I'll say my experience with this
14:52 - question is very different um I've only
14:54 - been at PNC and I came in through a
14:58 - development program so I didn't know my
15:01 - interviewer um they didn't tell us and I
15:03 - have interviews like next week and they
15:05 - I don't think they know who I am um so
15:08 - if that does happen to you I think it's
15:11 - still a safe assumption to go into the
15:14 - interview that the person that's
15:16 - interviewing you is was probably in your
15:18 - foot in your in your shoes at one point
15:21 - so I went through our development
15:22 - program I'm interviewing for a
15:24 - development program um so if they come
15:27 - to me and ask questions of like what did
15:29 - you think of the program how did it go
15:31 - what was your experience like that at
15:33 - least has like some um background
15:36 - questions that you can think of in your
15:37 - mind even if you don't know who your
15:39 - interviewer is um in case that situation
15:43 - happens because I know it's gonna happen
15:45 - for someone that interviews at PNC um so
15:48 - yeah that was just basically like you
15:50 - might not know who they are but don't
15:51 - let that PSY you out there's still some
15:54 - like basic questions that you can ask
15:56 - them um because they probably were in
15:58 - your shoes at one
16:00 - point um and I think I forgot to answer
16:02 - the question about LinkedIn as well um
16:05 - so as far as kind of connecting with me
16:07 - on LinkedIn um so I don't know
16:09 - everyone's um kind of experien with this
16:12 - but as a recruiter I get a lot of
16:13 - connection requests um and it's hard to
16:16 - like really stick out when you just send
16:19 - a request a request um so I was thinking
16:22 - about it today actually and I was
16:23 - talking to my fiance about it um and
16:26 - what really sticks out is meeting
16:27 - someone in person and sending them a
16:29 - follow-up note about your interaction
16:31 - with them because that sticks out it's
16:33 - someone that you've met in person
16:34 - whether it's a phone call or at an event
16:37 - um and you can kind of leave a nice note
16:40 - and that'll kind of stick in my mind
16:41 - more um and that's my perspective as
16:43 - someone that has a lot of connections on
16:44 - LinkedIn just based on my profession but
16:47 - I'd love to get um someone in more in
16:49 - the technical Fields uh advice as
16:55 - well for me personally I I resonate with
16:58 - that as well um whenever I've had an
17:01 - interview I always send some sort of
17:03 - follow-up to um to my interviewers but I
17:06 - like to do that after the interview as
17:07 - well that's kind of my way of following
17:09 - up um showing that I am still interested
17:13 - um that I want to keep the conversation
17:14 - going and um and and I think that that's
17:18 - like something a lot of times is
17:19 - overlooked is like after you're done
17:21 - with the interview um you still can kind
17:23 - of um show that effort that you are
17:26 - interested and kind of put yourself on
17:27 - the radar um a little
17:33 - more all right those are great advice um
17:38 - coming from multiple perspectives and um
17:41 - it it is um quite awesome to to hear
17:43 - this advice I feel like I'm learning to
17:47 - um so a lot of interviews kick off with
17:50 - the dreaded tell me a little about
17:52 - yourself
17:54 - question um what role do you think that
17:57 - storytelling plays and interviews and
18:00 - how can candidates effectively
18:02 - communicate their experiences and
18:04 - accomplishments through like an elevator
18:06 - pitch without sounding like a robot or
18:09 - like they're running lines that they've
18:13 - rehearsed um Morgan uh do you want to
18:16 - take this one first sure um so the one
18:20 - thing that I think is a really good
18:22 - thing the reason why this is a question
18:24 - is we really want to hear how you talk
18:26 - about your experiences what you've done
18:29 - um we're listening to your like
18:30 - communication skills we're also trying
18:32 - to pick up um things that you've done
18:37 - um and kind of trying to get like your
18:40 - personality um because this uh this
18:44 - elevator pitch can be as personal or
18:47 - professional as you want it to be um so
18:49 - I know like a lot of Prof or a lot of
18:52 - students now have personal projects so
18:54 - this is a great time to show off that
18:56 - personal project um if your school work
18:59 - isn't as exciting that shows that you're
19:01 - passionate that you care um and that you
19:04 - have like a strong ambition which is
19:05 - what we're looking for um and so I think
19:09 - the way to not sound like a robot
19:12 - practice practice with your friends um
19:15 - practice with someone who doesn't know
19:16 - you so they can give you some honest
19:18 - feedback of like I don't I still don't
19:21 - know what you said or I don't know what
19:22 - you're talking about um so don't just
19:24 - practice with friends friends will be
19:26 - easiest but try and get an outside
19:28 - perspective as
19:31 - well and I'll add to that like when you
19:35 - say practice right I've I've actually
19:37 - done this with like I'm going to use the
19:39 - example of like all my little cousins
19:41 - see me as the head of HR and they come
19:42 - to me for every HR question right and um
19:46 - they would come to me like if they're
19:48 - I'm actually updating one of their
19:49 - resumés right now I'm not a big person
19:52 - on like one resumé template is gold
19:55 - there there's different resumé templates
19:57 - that work for everyone but but people
19:59 - that
20:00 - typically are having trouble verbalizing
20:04 - an elevator pitch do better when there's
20:07 - like an objective or a summary that they
20:10 - feel good about summary statement on
20:12 - their resume and that I mean you're not
20:15 - going to write like a long essay as as
20:18 - your objective on your resume it's like
20:20 - probably two to three lines so if you
20:22 - feel if you're a better writer and you
20:25 - feel better as a writer um and you nail
20:29 - that statement on your
20:31 - resume then you can use vocalize that
20:35 - like on a call obviously your resume
20:37 - would also be in front of that recruiter
20:38 - so you're not reading from it but at
20:40 - least you feel comfortable with how you
20:42 - present yourself in writing and then you
20:44 - could start to get comfortable with it
20:46 - verbally so you're not just like
20:48 - regurgitating everything that's on your
20:50 - resume or every internship that you've
20:52 - had um so yeah like that that's my
20:55 - feedback back to people is like if you
20:57 - don't feel comfortable with it part of
20:59 - the practicing element to Morgan's Point
21:00 - is like some people are just better
21:02 - writers so focus on that and then get
21:04 - comfortable with it and start to say how
21:06 - you would start to practice how you
21:08 - would say it
21:10 - verbally I agree with that um and then
21:13 - as far as um kind of why the questions
21:15 - asked a lot of times it's there's no
21:17 - there's no right or wrong answer um it's
21:19 - all about your communication like can
21:21 - you tell me kind of concisely what the
21:25 - important parts of your career are or
21:26 - school or or internship um and it's
21:29 - similar to a resume um a lot of people
21:31 - ask me how long does a resume need to be
21:33 - um there's no right or wrong answer
21:36 - necessarily but I say between like
21:37 - usually one to two pages um as long as
21:40 - you're not like just beating the resume
21:43 - down with every little thing that's
21:45 - happened in your life I would say keep
21:46 - it concise um if it's something that
21:49 - you're proud of a proud project write it
21:51 - down and and similar similarly when
21:53 - you're having that conversation with
21:54 - your elevator pitch um kind of touch
21:56 - upon what your most of um a lot of the
21:59 - times as a recruiter I want to see what
22:00 - you're passionate about um that's what
22:03 - that's what I want to hear
22:05 - about um this is really great advice
22:08 - just um I'll kind of split this into
22:10 - sort of two um subtopics here so for the
22:13 - first one in terms of an elevator pitch
22:15 - I like to think of that as it's sort of
22:19 - a long enough time to get your point
22:21 - across but short enough to leave it open
22:24 - um for followup and so when I think of
22:26 - an elevator pitch um
22:29 - I always want to like try to practice
22:31 - ahead of time whether it be like for an
22:33 - interview um or if I'm going to any
22:35 - networking stuff like I'm always
22:36 - practicing it just so it comes off more
22:38 - natural um and I'm really just being um
22:41 - effective in the time that I have and so
22:42 - I kind of like to have like some sort of
22:44 - structure um behind it as well so really
22:47 - kind of going into who are you um what
22:49 - do you do what is your background what
22:52 - is your intent like kind of what you
22:53 - hope to get out of this conversation and
22:55 - where do you want to be and then end it
22:57 - with with like a call to action so maybe
23:00 - that being um maybe I can set some time
23:02 - for us to connect or or something like
23:04 - that and so um really the goal there is
23:08 - that the elevator pitch leads to
23:09 - something else whether that be a longer
23:11 - conversation just for some insights um
23:14 - an interview um whatever it is that
23:16 - you're looking for and then in terms of
23:18 - Storytelling in an interview
23:20 - specifically um that is so important um
23:24 - you want to be able to communicate your
23:26 - experience and your accomplish
23:28 - um effectively and articulate that
23:30 - clearly the interviewer doesn't have the
23:33 - same um context that you do they weren't
23:36 - there with you during the time that you
23:37 - were working on all of those things and
23:39 - so you want to practice um really
23:41 - highlighting um kind of the brief
23:44 - overview of whatever it is that you've
23:46 - worked on and then highlighting the
23:47 - impact that you had and and that's also
23:50 - something I feel like um a lot of times
23:52 - gets lost is you're super excited
23:54 - talking about the project that you
23:55 - worked on that you're not necessarily
23:57 - emphasizing um the impact that you had
23:59 - and that's really really powerful in
24:01 - demonstrating your capabilities and what
24:03 - you could bring to the
24:07 - team love that
24:09 - answer all right um so what are some
24:14 - other common interview questions that
24:17 - candidates should always be prepared to
24:19 - answer and how can they respond
24:24 - effectively um kin you want to take this
24:27 - one first
24:28 - yeah of course so I think this
24:30 - definitely varies depending on the type
24:32 - of interview that it is as well so maybe
24:35 - it's like a phone screen or an initial
24:37 - interview versus like um a behavioral
24:40 - interview or or technical interview so
24:41 - depending on the kind of interview that
24:43 - it is um and also for the type of role
24:45 - that it is you want to do your research
24:47 - accordingly for example like if you're
24:49 - interviewing for a Consulting role you
24:51 - might want to spend some time doing case
24:52 - studies or something like that whereas
24:54 - if you're interviewing for a Dev role
24:57 - you want to really make sure you
24:58 - understand like technical Concepts and
25:00 - all of that but in general if we're
25:02 - talking behavioral here um a lot of
25:04 - times like I've run into um situational
25:08 - questions like tell me about a time
25:10 - where you ran into this situation and um
25:13 - how did you successfully navigate it so
25:15 - for example tell me about a time where
25:17 - you let a project um or where you had a
25:19 - successful outcome um what was a
25:23 - challenge that you faced and how did you
25:24 - resolve that challenge was there
25:26 - anything that you could have improved on
25:28 - and so a lot of times this is again
25:30 - where story storytelling kind of comes
25:32 - to play I've noticed that like um the
25:34 - first question leads to smaller uh
25:37 - questions afterwards as follow-up so if
25:39 - it is like um about a project or
25:42 - something that you've worked on there's
25:43 - going to be like smaller um follow-ups
25:45 - afterwards so definitely think about
25:47 - kind of like what went well what would
25:48 - you improve on um some challenges that
25:50 - you faced and um and really kind of
25:53 - highlighting like not just your
25:55 - technical skills necessarily but also
25:57 - how you work in a team and and I think
26:00 - that's a great way to kind of showcase
26:01 - like you as an individual um you're more
26:05 - than just like the work that you do but
26:06 - it's also how do you communicate with
26:08 - others and um and work in a
26:13 - team um yeah so a lot of the questions
26:15 - we use a bit site um are around um just
26:19 - s similar to what um Canan just just
26:22 - mentioned but it's all about situations
26:24 - it's about conflict it's about if there
26:26 - is a hiccup like how do you how do you
26:28 - deal with the hiccup um and a lot of it
26:30 - is just seeing if you're a team player
26:32 - or or a problem solver um another good
26:35 - question that I I personally always ask
26:37 - people is um this is not applicable if
26:40 - it's your first job but if it's your
26:42 - second job um why are you looking and I
26:44 - always ask that question because um
26:48 - anyone can be looking for any reason um
26:50 - but you can also tell kind of the
26:52 - characteristics of an individual based
26:54 - on how they answer that question so if a
26:56 - lot of times people aren't happy where
26:58 - they are but you don't want to bash your
27:00 - employer um and that comes off to the
27:03 - interviewer um so that's my biggest tip
27:05 - to anyone that is looking for their
27:07 - second job or third job whatever it
27:10 - might be um always spin things to be
27:12 - positive and it's all about growth and
27:15 - um and and trying your best to be
27:17 - positive spinning like to the positive
27:20 - is interesting because to conin point
27:23 - earlier like behavioral based
27:25 - interviewing or behavioral based
27:26 - questions are going to ask you
27:28 - situational things and a recruiter may
27:31 - say tell me about a time that you had to
27:35 - lead X type of project um and how you
27:39 - successfully LED it or they may just say
27:43 - tell me about a time when you were bored
27:44 - on the job without saying and how did
27:48 - you make it more interesting because
27:49 - especially from a storytelling
27:51 - standpoint a recruiter doesn't want to
27:53 - lead you to the positive they just want
27:55 - to say tell me about a a situation time
27:58 - where you were dealt with this type of
28:00 - situation and see to Dave's point if
28:03 - you're going to take like a growth
28:05 - perspective or a positive mindset and
28:07 - how you answered it or how you are a
28:10 - problem solver so they'll like leave it
28:12 - open-ended and if you take it down the
28:14 - negative route that says a lot about how
28:16 - you deal with conflict or whatever it
28:17 - may be so be cognizant of the
28:20 - storytelling component that we were
28:22 - speaking about earlier is that the story
28:24 - is saying I was dealt with this
28:26 - situation or this is how I handled it
28:28 - and these are the positive implications
28:30 - of the measures that I
28:34 - took I mean I can't I really can't
28:37 - follow I can't beat anyone that everyone
28:39 - anything that everyone said because this
28:41 - was really good advice so kind of like
28:43 - to again picky back um especially if you
28:46 - get any of the questions that are like
28:48 - tell me about a weakness again spin it
28:51 - to that positive um perspective like
28:54 - you're not perfect but don't um don't
28:58 - downplay or don't um I don't know expand
29:02 - on a weakness that you think is a
29:03 - weakness that really could just be an
29:06 - opportunity instead um so yeah I I think
29:09 - I love how everyone has said it but like
29:11 - spinning it to a positive light um
29:14 - instead of a
29:20 - negative all right um Morgan I'll just
29:24 - come back to you with this next one at
29:26 - the end of an interview interviewers
29:28 - typically ask do you have any questions
29:30 - for me how can candidates use their
29:33 - pre-interview research to formulate
29:35 - thoughtful questions for the
29:37 - interviewer yeah so I think this goes
29:39 - back really well to our first and second
29:42 - questions of researching the company
29:44 - researching the person um this is your
29:47 - time if you haven't asked the question
29:49 - already um to interview the company that
29:52 - you're interviewing for so ask them
29:55 - about the company culture ask them about
29:57 - what other things that they do that's
29:59 - outside of their day job um ask them
30:02 - about any um opportunities for stretch
30:04 - assignments or other um skill like um
30:08 - availability to expand your skills um
30:12 - ask about is the internal Mobility
30:15 - because those are the questions that are
30:16 - really important that you don't want to
30:18 - forget once you're already in the
30:19 - company um because then it just makes it
30:22 - harder for either you to want to stay or
30:25 - continue to be motivated um so again
30:27 - this is your time to interview the
30:29 - company and find out if you will also be
30:32 - a very good fit for
30:34 - them um and I think it's important to
30:36 - always ask questions um it shows your
30:39 - interest as well um and obviously as
30:42 - Morgan mentioned it's your opportunity
30:44 - opportunity to interview the company
30:46 - it's not one-sided um so that's what I
30:49 - always tell candidates where it when you
30:51 - get past the recruiter and you talk to
30:53 - hiring manager or other members of the
30:54 - team understand kind of why they're in
30:56 - the seat why why did they choose
30:58 - bitsight um in my situation um I've been
31:01 - with bitsight for 5 years and my
31:03 - favorite questions are why people ask me
31:05 - I've been why I've been with bitsight
31:07 - for five years and why I haven't left um
31:10 - and I always give people people an
31:11 - interesting perspective I don't have
31:13 - this on my LinkedIn but I left bit site
31:14 - for a job to join a seed round company
31:18 - and then five months later I regretted
31:20 - that choice and texted my boss and she
31:22 - brought me back so that's my like number
31:24 - one story I tell people of why I joined
31:26 - bitsight and why I stayed site so that's
31:28 - the type of question that um like I like
31:30 - to ask people is why you chose your job
31:32 - and and how you've moved up as
31:38 - well um I just want to say that to Dave
31:42 - Dave's point that is one of the
31:43 - questions that I always try to ask as
31:45 - well um I always like to connect my
31:48 - questions at the end of an interview to
31:50 - something that the interviewer had
31:51 - mentioned um during the interview to
31:53 - just show that I was listening and
31:55 - trying to make it a little more
31:56 - conversational as well and so typically
31:58 - in the beginning of the interview the
32:00 - interviewer kind of gives like an
32:01 - overview of how long they've been at the
32:03 - company or something like that and so um
32:05 - maybe they they'll say like oh I've been
32:07 - um at X company for five years and then
32:10 - at the end you could be like okay well I
32:11 - remember you know you had mentioned
32:13 - you've been here at five years um why
32:15 - did you choose to be here and um what's
32:17 - kind of LED you to stay being here for
32:20 - for that long and that kind of stuff and
32:22 - and it just kind of shows that you
32:23 - paying attention and that you are
32:25 - interested and also you you get some
32:27 - into um the company culture there um and
32:30 - also if it is like something that you
32:32 - are interested in again like um I I kind
32:35 - of mentioned this in in the first
32:37 - question or second question as well but
32:39 - if there is um a connection to like a
32:42 - particular industry that you're
32:43 - interested in particular products or
32:46 - services that the company offers um
32:49 - anything specific to like teams that you
32:51 - know of anything like that um that you
32:53 - are interested in like this is the
32:55 - perfect time to bring it up if it hasn't
32:57 - has been brought up in the interview
32:58 - really highlighting that you're
32:59 - passionate about this space um and that
33:02 - you've taken the time to like you know
33:05 - do your research that you're interested
33:07 - that you're a good bit for this um for
33:10 - this company and also um think about
33:13 - like role specific questions as well
33:15 - maybe um what are some of the challenges
33:18 - um that people in the role are currently
33:21 - facing um and uh what are um what are
33:26 - the current challenges in that area
33:27 - today um or maybe what's a day in the
33:30 - life of this role look like at at the
33:32 - company stuff like that just to get a
33:34 - little more insight and show that you're
33:35 - interested um interested in that area um
33:38 - for early and career folks like I think
33:41 - this is a really cool opportunity
33:43 - because you don't have a lot of insight
33:46 - and so this is like a great way to show
33:49 - that you are interested and that you
33:51 - have um the interest in growing and and
33:54 - learning and I think that that's like
33:55 - one of the biggest things um recruiters
33:58 - would look for and I'm not a recruiter
34:00 - but I am early in career and so um
34:02 - that's something that has um brought me
34:04 - a lot of success in my interviews and so
34:06 - I'm
34:07 - definitely try to keep that in
34:10 - mind one thing that I wanted to add
34:12 - because I think this this is all great I
34:14 - I want to know how interested people are
34:16 - and building their career and learning
34:18 - about the company and all those
34:20 - questions if you reach it gets tough
34:23 - right when you're like in the third or
34:24 - fourth stage of an interview when you're
34:26 - in those final stages you're down to the
34:29 - wire so you're probably one of five
34:32 - candidates one of three or one of two
34:34 - candidates right in the final stages and
34:37 - so I always like to hear people ask me
34:42 - uh if I'm in that final round as an
34:43 - interviewer is there anything that I
34:46 - haven't shared or is there anything else
34:49 - that I can add details on um or give you
34:52 - more insight into that'll allow you to
34:55 - determine if I'm the right fit for the
34:57 - job so basically like this is your last
34:59 - ditch effort to say what else do you
35:01 - need from me to show to you that like
35:05 - you want to hire me right so like and
35:08 - it's it's not coming from a place of
35:10 - arrogance it's really like this may be
35:12 - your last chance so give the give
35:15 - yourself that opportunity um to close it
35:18 - out strong um and be prepared for
35:20 - whatever it is that they're going to ask
35:21 - you right like they may need Clarity on
35:23 - something and I wouldn't say this to a
35:26 - room
35:27 - recruiters or other HR folks but you
35:30 - also as a candidate have every right to
35:32 - ask about salary ranges and if it's not
35:35 - posted on the job at a certain point you
35:38 - also need to self- select out or self-
35:40 - select in based on what you need um to
35:44 - pay your bills so um and that's why like
35:48 - there are pay transparency laws not in
35:51 - every state it's not a federal law yet
35:53 - but certain states do need to post about
35:55 - um their salary ranges with jobs um so
35:59 - you're entitled to at a certain point in
36:01 - the it's probably not that tactful if
36:04 - you do it first thing right out the gate
36:07 - but um you can ask is there a salary
36:10 - range budgeted for this position and
36:12 - that's a very fair
36:15 - question that is a great way to ask
36:19 - that all right so um last question
36:24 - before we move on to audience Q&A um can
36:27 - you share some examples of questions or
36:30 - behaviors of candidates that impressed
36:33 - you during your interviews with them um
36:36 - Hai I'll come back to you first with
36:38 - that
36:40 - one um honestly I think um one of the
36:45 - and this goes back to my example about
36:47 - the website earlier I actually had
36:51 - someone um ask me a question about what
36:55 - we want our what we want the story of
36:57 - our culture to be on our
36:59 - website and um the reason why that
37:03 - resonated with me is because they were a
37:05 - designer and they were like a uxer and I
37:09 - answered the question and the person
37:12 - told me
37:13 - pointedly I hear that loud and clear in
37:16 - every interview I want to join this
37:18 - company because I love every single
37:20 - person that I met with and I think the
37:22 - culture really resonated with me by
37:24 - these conversations that I've had but as
37:27 - a candidate I did not see that on your
37:29 - website so that was like such it was
37:32 - like okay they're a designer they're
37:34 - looking at our website but they're also
37:35 - having that like ux research type of
37:38 - lens and it really sat with me and stuck
37:41 - with me because it was like they also
37:43 - gave me some feedback like I was like oh
37:44 - I don't want candidates to be deterred
37:46 - by our website so um that's something
37:49 - that was truly memorable for
37:55 - me
37:58 - Dave Morgan Canin anybody impress you
38:02 - lately with an interview
38:06 - question it wasn't a
38:09 - question or maybe it was a response to a
38:13 - question um I haven't interviewed a ton
38:16 - and a lot of people that I have
38:18 - interviewed have been early career um
38:20 - for like internships or development
38:23 - programs and honestly I I love when
38:28 - students come and talk about personal
38:31 - passion projects um so I'm an analytics
38:35 - and data's everywhere um so if you come
38:39 - in to an interview and you're just like
38:43 - I have always played the um played an
38:45 - instrument and I really wanted to get
38:48 - into see if there's some correlation
38:51 - between playing an instrument and
38:52 - something else I'm like huh I like why
38:56 - why like I want to know more about like
38:59 - why you chose that as a project um and
39:03 - then that helps to like highlight your
39:05 - skills your passion um and things like
39:07 - that so I would just say like my my
39:10 - favorite is when they come in with
39:12 - personal projects you do not have to
39:14 - have a personal project um it is just a
39:17 - thing that I've started to see more
39:19 - often um that I feel like does help
39:21 - candidates stand
39:24 - out um something had recently um that a
39:28 - candidate did was we were talking about
39:30 - one of the wrecks I was hiring for and
39:32 - we talked about a few points that um
39:35 - were important for the role that the
39:36 - candidate um was trying to remember from
39:39 - their past experience um and wasn't able
39:42 - to articulate articulate it fully in
39:44 - that phone call in that 20 minute phone
39:46 - call we had um so she actually sent me a
39:49 - follow-up email with some of those
39:51 - bullet points um which is super helpful
39:53 - because it showed that obviously she was
39:55 - passionate she cared she at the moment
39:57 - was blanking on it but the followup was
40:00 - obviously nice and thoughtful and and we
40:02 - were able to push the candidate through
40:03 - because they had all the skills that we
40:05 - were looking for um so I thought that
40:07 - was nice and I saw someone asked a
40:10 - question if um follow-up emails or if
40:13 - you should send follow-up emails and I
40:15 - do recommend them um so ask the
40:18 - recruiter just ask the recruiter what
40:20 - all the interviewers emails are um and
40:23 - they can and you can just send them
40:25 - emails um some companies might be weird
40:27 - about it bitsight bits sit's totally
40:30 - fine with it but if a company's being
40:31 - weird about sharing email addresses um
40:34 - just share a note with the recruiter and
40:36 - they can share it with the interview
40:37 - team as well um and that is a nice touch
40:40 - um I've gotten a lot of feedback from
40:41 - from hiring teams about candidates that
40:44 - obviously enjoyed the process and were
40:47 - positive about it after the
40:50 - fact um there are sort of two points
40:53 - here that I wanted to make the first is
40:57 - um especially for like technical roles
41:01 - um I think there's a lot of emphasis on
41:04 - highlighting um your technical
41:07 - accomplishments and the work that you've
41:08 - done on various projects um so if you
41:11 - have like other um experiences maybe
41:14 - you're um in in executive position for a
41:19 - club on campus or something like that
41:21 - that kind of highlights um a different
41:24 - skill set um I think adding that extra
41:27 - sort of flavor can really make you stand
41:29 - out as a candidate as well um and then
41:32 - the second point is depending on the
41:34 - kind of role that it is and um and how
41:37 - much time you have and also how
41:38 - interested you are in that um company or
41:41 - the role um spend some extra time
41:44 - digging into it for example I'm a
41:46 - product manager so um I really focus on
41:50 - like products and Diving deeper into
41:52 - that and so um if I was interviewing for
41:54 - a product manager role I definitely want
41:56 - to know like what the product is that I
42:00 - would probably be talking about or
42:02 - working on and and kind of have like um
42:05 - some sort of ideas in terms of these are
42:08 - problem areas things that could be
42:09 - better and and kind of get some of those
42:11 - points across to show like that you are
42:13 - creative that you have new ideas you can
42:15 - offer um some cool insights and and
42:22 - perspectives all right thank you all so
42:24 - much for sharing your Insight
42:27 - um we're going to move on now to a
42:28 - couple questions from our audience um
42:31 - remember if you do have a question for
42:33 - the panelist you can drop it in the Q&A
42:35 - box at the bottom of the
42:37 - screen um but the first one that has
42:40 - come in is as an early professional a
42:43 - piece of advice I often hear is to apply
42:46 - everywhere and not to limit yourself in
42:48 - terms of industry is it okay to apply
42:51 - and continue in the interview process if
42:53 - you're not particularly interested in
42:54 - the company itself but more so the role
42:57 - that they're
42:58 - offering um I'll let anybody jump in on
43:01 - that line I'll I'll start because I work
43:05 - at a bank and I never thought I would
43:07 - work at a
43:08 - bank
43:10 - um I think it's still a good idea
43:14 - to interview um and try out different
43:18 - companies and different Industries um I
43:21 - might work at a bank but like I I know
43:23 - like almost nothing about banking I know
43:26 - more about like the technical aspect
43:28 - like how we built our online banking and
43:31 - how like our security and architecture
43:34 - and things like that work behind the
43:36 - scenes but I mean if you start asking me
43:39 - about balance sheets and stuff I don't
43:41 - know I don't know um so I don't think it
43:44 - hurts to apply for other Industries um
43:48 - because honestly like I I wouldn't have
43:50 - known that like this type of job was
43:52 - available at a bank um so that's again
43:55 - where like during the interview you can
43:56 - ask those questions of like what are the
43:58 - types of projects they might not be able
44:00 - to tell you specifically um but they can
44:03 - still give you like a good idea to see
44:04 - if it would be a good fit um for you
44:07 - even though you're not as familiar or
44:09 - excited about the
44:10 - industry yeah to piggyback off that um
44:14 - so bitsight we're a cyber security
44:15 - company and um I work with a lot of
44:18 - software Engineers I hire a lot of
44:19 - software engineers and a lot of them
44:21 - don't really care about cyber security
44:24 - um they really are more passionate about
44:25 - the projects are working on um so that's
44:28 - why they work at bit site um similarly
44:31 - I'm I'm a recruiter um I'm not the most
44:34 - technical person in the world I I'm not
44:35 - a cyber security expert but um I I enjoy
44:38 - kind of the value bits I provides the
44:40 - world but also the people and the
44:41 - culture of the company so I think um the
44:44 - projects culture people are all
44:46 - different aspects you can take into
44:47 - account when you're um kind of choosing
44:49 - your your home when it comes to your
44:51 - next
44:54 - career
44:57 - just to add really quickly on that one
44:59 - as well um especially for early in
45:01 - career like um I think it's a really
45:04 - great opportunity to just expand um your
45:08 - knowledge we might not know like too
45:11 - much about an industry if if we haven't
45:13 - had experience in it so um if you have
45:16 - made it to the interview especially if
45:18 - it's a role that you care about like
45:20 - have that conversation with like the
45:21 - interviewer um and kind of go through
45:23 - the process and see like maybe this is
45:25 - something something that is actually
45:26 - interested to you uh interesting to you
45:28 - and something that you might be able to
45:30 - pursue and and for me like when I've
45:32 - gone through interviews um and had
45:35 - conversations with like um interviewers
45:37 - and and explored like projects that are
45:40 - being done and things that are being
45:42 - worked on I'm like okay wow like this is
45:44 - pretty cool I wouldn't have imagined
45:46 - this as like a possibility and so um
45:49 - it's possible that you find yourself in
45:51 - that category and that's great and on
45:53 - the flip side if you end up like in the
45:55 - situation
45:56 - where you're just like okay this is not
45:58 - for me like that's also great insight to
46:01 - have so you know like you don't need to
46:03 - spend your energy and your resources
46:05 - going after those kinds of
46:11 - roles all right um another audience
46:15 - question that we got um was um I was let
46:19 - go for my previous company a year ago
46:21 - and took some time off from applying to
46:23 - jobs to focus on family do you have any
46:26 - suggestions on how to explain this in a
46:28 - positive way when asked either why I
46:30 - left or about the
46:34 - Gap so you oh no go ahead I was gonna
46:38 - say that it's it's fairly like in
46:40 - today's economic World um the it's
46:43 - pretty common that people are being
46:44 - affected negatively um through layoffs U
46:47 - Mass layoffs um so I think it's pretty
46:49 - normal um but as far as spinning it I
46:52 - don't think you need to do like a ton of
46:54 - spinning work um it's more of just
46:56 - explaining hey we I was affected
46:57 - negatively by um a layoff but um I
47:00 - decided to kind of set some side some
47:03 - time aside for myself and kind of focus
47:05 - on family um and you don't even have to
47:08 - go into details or anything I just keep
47:10 - it simple um let them know you're
47:12 - negatively affected and um I think most
47:14 - people
47:16 - understand and like companies
47:21 - tenure people interviews are so much
47:25 - less Rob otic in today's world so like
47:28 - we're all humans we all have lives like
47:31 - things happen and Dave made a great
47:35 - point about like the state of the market
47:37 - right now and there's so many layoffs
47:39 - and that sort of thing but then also the
47:40 - human element of like if you need to say
47:43 - that you took care you don't have to go
47:44 - into detail but if you say took some
47:46 - time to tend to my
47:48 - family great like and if a company
47:51 - judges you for that remember that's
47:54 - probably not the company for you right
47:56 - so you're also interviewing them so
47:58 - again no need to spin it to the positive
48:01 - or try to figure like say that you
48:03 - accomplished X Y or Z during your time
48:05 - off like no it's just you're human with
48:08 - life circumstances and it's happen so
48:11 - just speak to it and not everyone's
48:13 - working at not saying this is bad but
48:15 - it's not like the General Motors time or
48:17 - era where you're at a company for 25
48:21 - years and retiring from said company
48:23 - which if you do great but there's also
48:25 - people that are moving around a lot or
48:27 - taking breaks or taking sabatical and
48:29 - that's becoming more of the
48:31 - norm great answers we have a couple more
48:35 - minutes for just one more audience
48:38 - question um so I will go with this one
48:42 - on our resume should we include
48:44 - technical skills that we are not
48:46 - proficient in for example I know SQL
48:49 - programming but I'm not that great at it
48:53 - what do we think about that
49:00 - I was just going to say you guys are
49:01 - early career especially because your
49:04 - early career put it on your resume um
49:07 - even if you've only just had a class on
49:09 - it that at least shows that like you're
49:12 - not starting from nothing um a lot of
49:16 - these entry level positions they'll
49:18 - teach you um what I learned in school
49:21 - for python is not what I do at work um
49:24 - our systems are different the syntax is
49:27 - the same but like our systems are
49:29 - different So like um put it on your
49:31 - resume um and definitely be honest about
49:36 - your um competency in it don't don't
49:42 - lie great advice I'll just one quick
49:45 - thing too is that especially for
49:48 - developers um there are technical
49:50 - assessments and usually ones that are
49:52 - geared towards Junior to mid-level
49:55 - develop veler roles are more academic in
49:58 - their assessment so it's going to
50:01 - probably be like what you learned in a
50:02 - book on SQL in your class versus like
50:05 - actually doing something in a live
50:07 - coding environment so I have seen more
50:09 - like academic questions on technical
50:12 - assessments which should make you feel
50:13 - more comfortable as someone who
50:15 - potentially is right out of a program
50:16 - Boot Camp or
50:20 - school right so Rapidfire last question
50:24 - for all of our panels
50:26 - lists um what resources such as online
50:30 - platforms or mock interviews do you
50:32 - recommend for candidates to simulate
50:34 - real interview scenarios and improve
50:37 - their performance so we can just go
50:39 - around and give some quick answers on
50:43 - that um so something that helped me when
50:46 - I was interviewing was I went to
50:48 - Providence for for college and um they
50:51 - did a lot of programs with mock
50:53 - interviewing there um so if you are
50:55 - still like earlier in your career and
50:57 - you have good relationships with your
50:59 - your College University I would
51:00 - recommend kind of using some of those
51:02 - resources because typically it it is
51:07 - free yeah definitely um I would piggy
51:10 - back off of that and stay tap into your
51:12 - network um if you are active on LinkedIn
51:16 - for example like you could reach out to
51:18 - folks and um see if someone is willing
51:20 - to to do a mock interview with you um if
51:22 - they have the time um or even just like
51:25 - together with some of your friends um
51:27 - classmates um who might have like
51:29 - similar um background and kind of also
51:32 - be preparing for interviews and might be
51:33 - able to help you out there also on
51:35 - campus like there's probably a lot of
51:37 - clubs that um sometimes host like um
51:40 - workshops and stuff like that so um stay
51:42 - plugged in and and kind of create your
51:44 - support system there and also YouTube
51:46 - videos YouTube videos are super helpful
51:48 - and and kind of thinking about how um
51:51 - seeing how others think about problems
51:52 - and how you might be able to solve it um
51:54 - in real time
51:57 - so ironically that was going to be my
51:58 - answer um YouTube videos because a lot
52:01 - of companies either the questions are
52:02 - very similar or there's just a lot of
52:04 - people who have gone through interviews
52:06 - for some major companies um so they have
52:08 - all the questions and they don't change
52:10 - often so 100% YouTube videos um and then
52:13 - Googling because you can also Google the
52:15 - same thing of like what is the uh
52:18 - analytics interview at Google like you
52:20 - you can just Google that um and a lot of
52:22 - times a lot of resources will come up
52:24 - but don't don't sleep on um your school
52:27 - and resources they provide you for free
52:30 - free because you're paying for it um
52:32 - with your tuition
52:33 - so and honestly like you have your phone
52:36 - so like a lot of interviews are virtual
52:39 - now so record yourself answering
52:43 - questions that you either we gave you
52:45 - some questions in this like behavioral
52:47 - based questions or you Google like what
52:50 - may come up in a technical interview and
52:52 - just record yourself and listen back I I
52:55 - can't tell you the number of times I've
52:56 - watched a zoom recording of myself for a
52:58 - training I've LED at the company and I
53:00 - can't I'm like oh I I butchered that you
53:04 - know or I really truly didn't understand
53:08 - what that was because you can hear it
53:09 - with all my ums right so just record
53:12 - yourself answer it that's where you can
53:14 - practice your elevator pitch and see how
53:17 - it sounds so um get comfortable in the
53:21 - uncomfortable a little bit and to pigy
53:24 - back off that I think going to
53:25 - networking events and just different
53:27 - situations out there just put yourself
53:29 - out there and just talk to people um I
53:32 - think a lot of it is just get getting
53:34 - comfortable talking to strangers and
53:36 - kind of getting out of your own comfort
53:38 - zone um and that'll translate to
53:44 - interviews well we are wrapping up
53:46 - tonight's conversation but don't go just
53:49 - yet we have our final pre-hiring Summit
