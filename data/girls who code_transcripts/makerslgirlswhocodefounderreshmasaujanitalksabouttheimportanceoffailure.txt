00:00 - things don't come easily to me I never
00:02 - get things on the first time or the
00:03 - second time more like the third or the
00:05 - fourth
00:06 - [Music]
00:12 - time my parents came here as political
00:14 - refugees from
00:16 - Uganda my father was watching television
00:19 - and Ed Amin who was the dictator there
00:21 - in Uganda came on and said that all of
00:23 - the Indians in the country had 90 days
00:25 - to leave the
00:27 - country the United States was the only
00:29 - country that let them in so my parents
00:31 - are probably the two most patriotic
00:33 - people that you will ever
00:35 - meet no matter how tired my father was
00:38 - every day he would come home take out a
00:40 - book put me on his lap and read to me
00:44 - books that were about people who are
00:46 - doing good things Dr King or mahath
00:48 - mandhi or Elanor Roosevelt and so it was
00:50 - these incredible like change agents and
00:53 - I think that that always like really
00:54 - stayed with me I always wanted to
00:58 - serve
01:02 - [Music]
01:05 - I was a young woman who always knew what
01:06 - she wanted to do I always wanted to
01:07 - serve and and hopefully run for office
01:09 - and then I woke up when I was you know
01:11 - 32 years old and realized that I was on
01:14 - the wrong path I was really engaged in
01:17 - the 2008 presidential election and I
01:19 - remember watching Hillary's concession
01:21 - speech and I felt like she was looking
01:22 - right at me and she said you know just
01:25 - because I failed doesn't mean that you
01:27 - shouldn't try to and I just kind of took
01:30 - a really deep look in and said you know
01:31 - what am I afraid
01:33 - [Music]
01:39 - of and it was the best year of my life
01:42 - everything was like jumping off a cliff
01:44 - I remember my first television interview
01:46 - was with Chris Matthews her name is R
01:48 - Johnny she's a lawyer and activist I had
01:50 - never been media trained before
01:52 - terrified but it was incredible what
01:54 - would you I want to give you an idea
01:56 - we're we're proposing what we call a
01:57 - national Innovation bank I believe that
01:59 - New York City has the capacity to become
02:00 - the city of innovation and I lost and
02:03 - lost big put myself in debt maxed out
02:06 - everybody in my life I felt like I had
02:08 - just let down so many people and started
02:12 - really thinking about you know as women
02:14 - like how do we feel about risk and
02:15 - failure right we live in this Society
02:17 - that's so ashamed of failure and so I
02:21 - immediately started talking about how I
02:22 - felt and that I was going to pick myself
02:24 - right back up and get back out there and
02:26 - meet those commitments that I had made
02:28 - to those constituents
02:36 - we focused on teenage girls and girls
02:38 - who didn't have access to technology
02:40 - that was really important for us there's
02:43 - going to be 1.4 million jobs that are
02:45 - open in the next 20 years in science
02:47 - technology engineering and math but
02:50 - right now only one out of seven
02:51 - Engineers is a woman and girls who code
02:54 - wants to change that with girls there's
02:57 - not an aptitude issue but when you ask a
02:59 - girl what she wants to do with her life
03:00 - she says I want to change the world and
03:03 - when she closes her eyes and she thinks
03:05 - about what a computer scientist looks
03:06 - like she sees a guy just kind of at a
03:08 - computer typing away so what we do at
03:11 - girls who code is we not only teach them
03:13 - the hard skills but we expose them to
03:15 - technologist who are changing the world
03:17 - and when they get exposed to it they're
03:19 - passionate about it and they're good at
03:21 - it you know one of my young girls Kora
03:23 - her father got diagnosed with cancer so
03:26 - she developed an algorithm that would
03:28 - help detect whether cancer was benign or
03:31 - malignant she's 15 years old we don't
03:34 - even know what the world would look like
03:36 - if we gave girls The Leverage and the
03:38 - power of Technology the ideas that they
03:40 - come up with are so different than if I
03:43 - was teaching a group of 20 boys right
03:45 - and all of their ideas are centered
03:47 - around changing the world they'll do it
03:50 - I have no
03:51 - [Music]
03:58 - doubt
03:59 - [Music]
04:02 - I have a lot of resilience part of it is
04:05 - like if you haven't failed yet you
04:07 - haven't tried
04:10 - [Music]
04:14 - anything
