02:08 - fuel yeah I mean I know his job is
02:10 - really difficult but he keeps the good
02:12 - eye on himself he won't do anything that
02:14 - you know would put his life in jeopardy

02:24 - I wanted to go to college I want her to
02:27 - have more opportunities in life that's
02:30 - why I put Courtney encoding the goal was
02:39 - really just trying to get them
02:41 - comfortable not being afraid to make
02:42 - mistakes

03:32 - stuff I get to see my what I create come
03:35 - to life I put her in these
03:38 - extracurricular activities so she can
03:40 - advance and have a career that's less
03:43 - labor-intensive something that she had
03:46 - more time with with her family I think
03:49 - coding will give them you know more
03:52 - opportunity for not only employment but
