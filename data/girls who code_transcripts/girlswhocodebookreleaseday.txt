00:10 - really really works on how we can bring
00:13 - the girls who code magic to anybody
00:16 - regardless of where they live and what
00:18 - they have access to so the books are
00:20 - just another tool for girls to
00:23 - find computer science and fall in love
00:25 - with it
00:36 - we decided to do something that might
00:38 - seem a little old-school decided to
00:40 - write a book because far too many kids
00:43 - in our country don't have access to
00:45 - Wi-Fi in their schools or their homes
00:49 - shot at learning how to computer program
00:52 - and so we are so excited than thrilled
00:55 - dentist told me that every Queens
00:58 - resident lives within a mile of a Queens
01:00 - public library I look around and see
01:02 - these amazing kids and I want all of
01:04 - them to be horrible coats you know it's
01:09 - really powerful to see those here at the
01:12 - library to see the kids and to know that
01:15 - there's no these people who walk into
01:16 - here and that's they're gonna get a
01:18 - chance to be a part of our movement so I
01:21 - moved not only of this country but what
01:33 - its future looks like I didn't feel
01:36 - proud because of the girls in our
01:38 - program and what it means to own your
01:40 - self-worth so I think that my point is
01:43 - that you don't have to look a certain
01:44 - way to be software engineer and I'm very
01:47 - about this cause I've been speaking for
01:48 - like four years about it I guess I just
01:51 - fooled myself into thinking that that
01:53 - was the norm you know there will always
01:55 - be more men in tech and I will always be
01:58 - that girl who has to prove herself has
02:01 - to even at times blend
02:03 - and as a result I've been invited to
02:05 - many tech events and many hackathons to
02:08 - speak I have won many competitions
02:10 - including more he kinda had like two
02:13 - months ago and I know that it's the
02:17 - responsibility of all of us not just
02:19 - women to ensure that they do whenever
02:22 - there is an attempt to remove your voice
02:25 - complain take the skills that you use to
02:29 - make sure that it improves the lives of
02:31 - the authors in the country and the world
02:33 - because that's what technology really
02:35 - suppose it's just a very feel-good rally
02:48 - and it just made me more confident more
02:51 - curious and more passionate person
02:53 - especially when it keeps coding
02:59 - so we are in a dangerous time I think in
03:03 - terms of the what the economic potential
03:05 - is for our girls and Hills are changing
03:07 - our messages the attentional general
03:12 - stupid is so proud he's just finished a
03:15 - year after school and I've just seen our
03:18 - you know working for projects and it's
03:22 - just been wonderful
