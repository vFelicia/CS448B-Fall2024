00:05 - two years ago my cousin and I were
00:07 - reading in the drive-through of a
00:08 - shawarma restaurant in satiric and while
00:11 - we were waiting for our food began
00:13 - talking about our aspirations and what
00:15 - we wanted to do in the future I remember
00:17 - telling her I wanted to be the first
00:19 - female foreign minister of Saudi Arabia
00:21 - and she wanted to be an engineer both
00:23 - industries that were almost exclusively
00:25 - male-dominated this was two years ago
00:27 - before any of the changes in Saudi
00:29 - Arabia had happened such as the driving
00:31 - ban being lifted and more women being
00:33 - encouraged to enter the work field our
00:35 - conversations were reflecting the
00:37 - obstacles that would have to face not
00:39 - because we would not be qualified but
00:41 - just because we were women
00:42 - she might not remember this moment but I
00:45 - will always remember what she said to
00:46 - support me she said we have to work
00:49 - twice as hard but reaching your goal
00:50 - will be twice as sweet at this moment
00:53 - sister would seem to be the most
00:54 - presence the simple dialogue
00:57 - strengthened our bond and made us feel
00:58 - both more empowered
01:00 - I now realize although it might not be
01:02 - as overt sisterhood is in every micro
01:04 - interaction I have with all the
01:06 - wonderful female figures in my life
