19:12 - in her new home in Colorado so I'd love
19:15 - to thank you all for joining us this
19:18 - evening um and let's jump into our
19:21 - discussion so our first question uh for
19:24 - our panelists is regarding you know
19:26 - preparation uh for the hiring Summit for
19:29 - some folks the hiring Summit this Friday
19:31 - may be their first career fair or their
19:34 - first virtual career fair uh so what
19:37 - should attendees do uh to best prepare
19:40 - for this dayong
19:49 - event I can kick things off um I think
19:53 - uh one of the first things to really be
19:57 - ready with is your resume uh ensure that
20:00 - it's up to date ensure your LinkedIn
20:03 - profile is also up to date um and ensure
20:07 - that both you have uh they're both
20:10 - sharable I think it's also good to have
20:13 - a very concise elevator pitch ready and
20:17 - what you would typically want to include
20:20 - in that is what you are doing right now
20:24 - um and what you're looking for or your
20:27 - professional experience
20:29 - ience I think that's great uh and I
20:32 - would Echo that same thing I always tell
20:35 - people to figure out your intention when
20:38 - visiting and going into this perspective
20:40 - and what I mean by that is when you're
20:42 - coming either virtually connecting is
20:44 - your intention to find a job is your
20:46 - intention to learn is your intention to
20:49 - just be present and take it all in if
20:50 - it's your first experience that
20:52 - intention will drive what actions you
20:54 - would probably need to take so having
20:56 - your elevator pitch is great having your
20:58 - content together is great but also an
21:00 - exercise that we do even within the
21:02 - corporate function years into a career
21:04 - is what are your skill sets so just
21:06 - knowing yourself right so what am I
21:08 - coming to get what am I coming to
21:09 - provide what do I know that I'm good at
21:12 - what experiences do I have and and what
21:14 - might I be looking for and when we talk
21:16 - about what might I be looking for not
21:17 - even specifically role by title um but I
21:21 - know I'm good in this Skillets and I
21:22 - know that these companies are present so
21:25 - in my mind I know that there has to be
21:27 - an attachment so so here's what I'm good
21:29 - at here's my elevator pitch how might
21:31 - that look within your organization and
21:32 - how might that be an opportunity to
21:34 - advance so really becomes a fun
21:36 - experience or a better experience
21:39 - because you're going with intention
21:41 - rather than going just to kind of figure
21:43 - it out on the
21:46 - spot definitely I wholeheartly agree I
21:49 - would also say um do your research on
21:52 - the companies uh beforehand once that
21:54 - list of corporate Partners is released
21:56 - uh for the hiring Summit uh make sure
21:58 - you know all of the opportunities that
22:00 - they have available in the summit what
22:02 - exactly are they promoting and like uh
22:04 - Adonis I hope you're pronouncing your
22:06 - name right um um like like he said um
22:11 - make sure that you know your skills and
22:13 - um and look at the opportunities read
22:15 - the descriptions and see where your
22:17 - skill sets match and then when you get
22:20 - in those text chats in the summit say
22:22 - hey I'm really interest interested in
22:24 - this role who can who can help me in
22:26 - this role who can connect me who
22:28 - um explain um the details of this role
22:31 - and how can I further pursue this
22:33 - opportunity and one last thing I'll add
22:35 - on that when you make a connection with
22:37 - the recruiter somebody that's there U be
22:40 - intentional about following up with that
22:41 - connection right and so can I add you on
22:44 - LinkedIn or is it possible I know we're
22:46 - having a small chat today but have a
22:47 - oneto one next week I would love to just
22:49 - take some time 30 minute call
22:51 - conversation and so it's okay to have
22:53 - initiative even if you're not 100% sure
22:56 - right it's okay to kind of put yourself
22:58 - out there have that connection and don't
23:00 - be afraid to ask questions or prepare
23:03 - questions that you actually want to know
23:05 - the answer to oftentimes we go and we
23:07 - ask general questions or we prepare a
23:09 - set of general questions which is fine
23:11 - but what is it that you really want to
23:12 - know is it about diversity initiatives
23:15 - is about the likelihood of getting hired
23:16 - is it about leadership representation is
23:18 - it about location compensation so when
23:21 - we talk about intentionality go with a
23:24 - plan and go with questions that you
23:26 - actually when you leave
23:28 - provide something to you and provide
23:31 - answers for you that you can then lean
23:32 - on to follow up yeah Adonis we met you
23:35 - talked about compensation you talked
23:36 - about being based on the west region I
23:38 - want to dive in a little bit deeper to
23:39 - see what a long-term career would look
23:41 - like so use that as a launching pad to
23:43 - sustain communication which will
23:45 - ultimately help you land a position
23:47 - either at that firm or somewhere within
23:48 - that firm or company's
23:53 - Network thank you all so much for such
23:55 - like invaluable Insight um
23:58 - and another question we have for you all
24:01 - is considering that the hiring Summit is
24:04 - completely virtual um how would you say
24:06 - that a virtual career fair uh compares
24:09 - to one that is in person you know what
24:11 - are some advantages of having a virtual
24:14 - event that attendees may not be aware
24:20 - of I enjoy both I come from my side of
24:25 - my recruiting career when everything was
24:26 - in person virtually wasn't even a thing
24:29 - and then Co hit and then we're in postco
24:31 - um the great thing about virtual
24:34 - connects is how quickly you can connect
24:36 - with a great amount of people and so
24:38 - casting your net extremely wide when
24:40 - you're in person you're kind of locked
24:41 - into some of those conversations and
24:43 - it's hard to maybe break the tie
24:45 - especially I remember my first time at a
24:46 - career fa I didn't know how to start or
24:48 - end a conversation so I sat there for 30
24:51 - minutes uh virtually you cast a wider
24:53 - net you can connect with a lot more
24:55 - people and that connection lag so when
24:58 - we talk about that virtual space again
25:01 - leverage LinkedIn leverage setting up a
25:03 - follow-up call leverage being able to
25:05 - navigate leverage leaving the
25:07 - conversation right leverage having
25:09 - something trackable the thing about
25:11 - virtual 2 that I enjoy is that
25:13 - conversation is almost a trackable
25:15 - conversation so we are almost able to
25:16 - pull that data and pull that or have
25:18 - that track somewhere and so you don't
25:20 - lose touch after that first piece um you
25:23 - can contain that and continue that what
25:25 - I will say about virtual that we must
25:27 - not forget is your brand is still
25:29 - important in a virtual environment how
25:31 - you not just how you show up but what
25:34 - you ask and what you want to know and
25:36 - and your brand and what you know about
25:37 - your brand is equally important in a
25:39 - virtual environment as it is in an
25:40 - in-person environment and probably
25:42 - almost more important in a virtual
25:44 - environment um because you don't have
25:46 - all of the other kind of
25:48 - situations filling the space um so I go
25:52 - back to intentionality and I'll say it
25:53 - 50 more times uh be intentional about
25:56 - your approach but virtual was great
25:58 - right cast a wide net and stay connected
26:01 - uh versus in
26:05 - person yeah I think one of the things
26:08 - that I really like about having a
26:10 - virtual experience is that you can
26:13 - really um you can really get information
26:16 - that's storable information like okay
26:19 - which people You' have connected with
26:20 - you can I what I like to do personally
26:22 - is whenever I connect with somebody I
26:24 - make sure that I note down their
26:26 - information kind of immediately because
26:28 - there'll be a lot of people who are
26:30 - talking about their experiences not just
26:33 - you know corporate Partners or panelists
26:35 - just in general you you'll find a lot of
26:38 - people who you resonate with who sound
26:40 - like super interesting who you would
26:42 - like to collaborate with and they're
26:45 - sharing their LinkedIn profiles they're
26:47 - sharing their um contact information and
26:50 - I think um what I like to do is if I see
26:53 - somebody who I admire I always I can I
26:56 - can actually get that information very
26:58 - easily and then set up future
27:00 - conversations with them so it's not just
27:03 - um the hiring Summit it's just like
27:07 - building a better Network for
27:11 - yourself absolutely I would even also
27:14 - add as an attendee of the last season's
27:17 - hiring Summit um I also enjoy the
27:20 - flexibility as well like when I've gone
27:22 - to in-person conferences in the past it
27:24 - was so hard to choose between should I
27:26 - stay at the career fair all day
27:28 - or can I go to these panels or these
27:30 - other different events going on at the
27:31 - conference so what I like about the
27:33 - virtual setting is just having the
27:34 - flexibility of being able to sit in on a
27:37 - fireside chat or like one of these
27:39 - amazing panels and still cast your net
27:42 - like um into the network and still um
27:44 - connect with um recruiters at the booth
27:47 - or with other attendees as well so I so
27:50 - I enjoy just having like a 10 tabs going
27:53 - to different places in the event and
27:55 - making sure that I'm taking full
27:57 - advantage of it and also personally for
27:59 - myself I've Al I found iners conferences
28:02 - especially postco uh to be a little bit
28:05 - overwhelming um especially with the
28:07 - crowds of people that have gone in and
28:09 - especially at the career Expo um what I
28:12 - like about the virtual setting is that
28:14 - I'm able to close my computer after um
28:17 - an interview or an event or after a
28:20 - small conversation and say okay I need
28:22 - to take five minutes I need to um you
28:26 - know find my space and then go and then
28:28 - go back out
28:32 - there this is all such wonderful um I
28:36 - guess insights and do you all have some
28:39 - maybe best practices that you can share
28:42 - with our attendees this evening um for
28:45 - virtual meetings and
28:53 - interviews I would say for virtual me
28:56 - just have have I think we talked about
28:58 - it before and there's things in the chat
29:00 - your elevator pitch or that that initial
29:03 - introductory had that already planned
29:05 - out practice that a few times have it
29:07 - typed out that you can send it and in
29:09 - that elevator pitch it's it's not as
29:11 - daunting as it may sound but essentially
29:13 - who you are where you are what you're
29:16 - doing right what you're looking for what
29:19 - you're good at what skills you have and
29:21 - you put that into an elevator pitch very
29:24 - very quickly um and then attach that to
29:26 - whoever you're talking to so my name is
29:27 - is Adonis I'm based in downtown Austin
29:29 - Texas I'm a graduate of Kansas State
29:31 - University I'm really looking to
29:33 - leverage my skill sets in marketing and
29:35 - sales and communication I know that I'm
29:36 - good at leadership I know that I'm good
29:38 - at this um but I want to look for a role
29:40 - that leverages all of these skill sets I
29:42 - know at your firm you handle marketing I
29:44 - know at your firm you have consultants
29:45 - and you hire entry level I want to
29:47 - understand how these skill sets in this
29:49 - location align with what you're looking
29:50 - for right thinking on the spot very
29:52 - quick very concise you know where I am
29:54 - who I am what my skills are what my
29:56 - background is you know I know about your
29:58 - company let's then connect um and then
30:01 - ask questions so the biggest thing is
30:03 - gain a ton of insight um my last point
30:07 - that I'll make is you know you better
30:09 - than anybody else knows you right you
30:11 - know your skill sets and what you have
30:13 - to offer what you're not great at better
30:15 - than anyone else's so when you're going
30:16 - into an interview or going into a
30:18 - conversation be confident enough that
30:20 - you know what you're good at right you
30:22 - know you I have no idea who you are so
30:24 - come to the table and be excited to talk
30:26 - about the things that you know but also
30:28 - be excited to talk about the things that
30:30 - you you may not be so good at right and
30:32 - what you're doing to scale and leverage
30:34 - that these I this is a nervous and
30:37 - daunting environment when you're talking
30:38 - to corporations of course but it's
30:41 - exciting because it's fail proof because
30:43 - you know you better than than we do
30:45 - right so um just being being confident
30:48 - in that aspect and if you're not and
30:49 - don't have that confidence just fake it
30:51 - to you make it right um because you know
30:54 - you again better than we
30:56 - do
30:59 - yeah that's those are some great points
31:02 - um I wanted to add that
31:06 - uh because companies and just people
31:09 - will be talking to a lot of people if
31:12 - you have something that makes you stand
31:13 - out I think that's that really helps um
31:17 - if you have Clarity for what you're
31:18 - looking for if um if you have some value
31:22 - for the company that resonates with you
31:24 - and you highlight that I think um just
31:27 - people who are ready to help you will
31:30 - remember you more I think one part of
31:34 - being networking and virtual events is
31:37 - being
31:43 - memorable and that I would say oh
31:46 - Natalie would you have something to add
31:48 - go ahead sorry uh I just I just want to
31:51 - Echo that that sentiment um if there's
31:53 - something memorable definitely stand um
31:56 - that helps you stand out definitely say
31:57 - it one thing I want to add coming from
32:00 - sales and earlier of my career in
32:02 - training uh they used to always tell us
32:05 - do not leave that call without um
32:08 - closing the sale and so what the close
32:10 - of the sale means is don't end that
32:12 - interview don't end that conversation
32:14 - with the so next steps so from here or
32:18 - what the followup is so don't leave a
32:20 - conversation a connection a on to one
32:22 - without closing the sale and that
32:24 - doesn't mean that you get firm firm firm
32:25 - next steps but you say hey I'm excited
32:27 - I'm interested based on our conversation
32:29 - would you be open to having a one to one
32:31 - next week or when can I expect to hear
32:33 - from you if I don't hear from you by
32:34 - that date is it okay that I reach out or
32:37 - it depending on the process so in the
32:39 - back of your mind in any
32:41 - interaction don't leave without closing
32:43 - the sale and that doesn't always mean
32:45 - I'm getting something but it means that
32:48 - at least I know that this company that
32:50 - I'm interested and is also interested
32:52 - and I have to pretty much nod to go
32:54 - ahead and follow up with this particular
32:56 - individual following the event so it's
32:58 - creating right like we talked about
33:02 - intentionality but also a network in
33:04 - communication and something to look
33:06 - forward to rather than this is a great
33:07 - conversation and then you never you're
33:09 - not able to connect with that same
33:10 - person again or they're not the
33:12 - recruiting resource so they go back give
33:14 - your information to the recruiting
33:15 - resource and you get lost in the sauce
33:17 - right so um that piece and always ask to
33:21 - in that followup my last Point um is um
33:24 - are you the proper like is this the
33:26 - proper connection that I would have or
33:27 - would you recommend that I connect with
33:29 - recruiting what is going to be the most
33:31 - initial uh process typically a business
33:33 - rep will say I will take this but I will
33:36 - toss it over to recruiting so just make
33:38 - sure that in the followup that you're
33:39 - getting who and what next it may not be
33:42 - super concrete but don't leave without
33:44 - closing the
33:47 - sale I love that love all these points
33:50 - and you know we we started talking a
33:52 - little bit about it you know just making
33:53 - that impression and networking um so
33:56 - would would definitely love to hear from
33:58 - you all you know we understand the
34:00 - importance but like how important is it
34:02 - to network during a hiring fair and how
34:05 - can our candidates make those memorable
34:07 - Impressions when they are interacting
34:09 - with potential
34:17 - employers I'm happy to jump in um but uh
34:20 - networking is key uh I come from an
34:23 - industry in a space especially in
34:24 - Consulting where you will see other
34:27 - people again um wild enough the former
34:30 - company that I worked at is a now a
34:32 - client of the company that I work at now
34:34 - um and that relationship is so important
34:36 - to sustain what I always used to do
34:38 - going into Career Fairs especially
34:39 - virtual is if I know especially in this
34:42 - meeting oh there's somebody in Austin or
34:43 - there's somebody in my Market unit like
34:45 - I have their name like let me connect
34:46 - with them on LinkedIn or let me try to
34:48 - have these conversations and bounce
34:50 - ideas off of each other sharing tips and
34:53 - tricks where they want to go having
34:54 - intentional conversation camaraderie
34:56 - they may have somebody in their Network
34:58 - that they can share with you um just
35:00 - genuine conversation that you might have
35:02 - hey I'm I see you're based in Austin or
35:04 - hey I see you're based in LA or I see
35:06 - you at this University or this school
35:07 - would love to learn more connect so
35:09 - those oneto ones chats those 30 minute
35:11 - conversations those interviews of each
35:13 - other are not specific to company but
35:15 - set that time apart to visit with
35:17 - individuals that you may run across in
35:19 - roundtables or that you may run across
35:21 - just in passing or in a chat function
35:23 - like this right um and don't be afraid
35:25 - to put your LinkedIn out there put a
35:27 - call to action out there to say hey I'm
35:28 - open to connecting with anyone having
35:30 - conversations to help build your network
35:33 - that is going to be key especially now
35:36 - in in the shift of the industry and the
35:38 - shift of the nation and how we plan to
35:40 - be staying connected is going to be and
35:44 - is really the only way as you look to
35:47 - progress your career that that type of
35:48 - work will happen um and it's it's kind
35:51 - of fun to do if you think about all you
35:52 - do is talk about yourself like you know
35:54 - you better than anyone else right so so
35:57 - that should be super
36:01 - easy um yeah I think those are great
36:04 - points and just to add a little bit to
36:07 - it um I feel
36:09 - like when you're applying to a role or
36:14 - you know you're connecting with somebody
36:16 - on um a virtual career fair there are
36:19 - just so many people right um so if if
36:22 - you have a onetoone conversation that
36:24 - you think is gone well if you have like
36:27 - points that you are able to bring across
36:29 - your excitement that you get to the
36:31 - table um Everybody in the a career affir
36:35 - is going to want to help you succeed so
36:39 - I think it's important to um kind of
36:41 - Leverage those connections because they
36:44 - want to help you um you've left a good
36:46 - impression right um so I think it's very
36:50 - um important to follow up with those
36:53 - connections and uh because you stood out
36:56 - already ready you stood out from the
36:58 - hundreds and thousands of people who
37:00 - have applied um so you've done the work
37:03 - so just sustaining that is really
37:09 - important I I also want to highlight the
37:12 - importance of peer-to-peer networking as
37:14 - well um I mean we're all going into this
37:16 - hiring Summit together um you know we're
37:19 - all looking for very similar employment
37:21 - opportunities and I think it's so
37:23 - valuable to have a community right
37:25 - behind you you know when you're going
37:27 - through this process when you're making
37:29 - these connections um with recruiters and
37:32 - and and employers um I mean what helped
37:34 - me in the last hiring Summit actually
37:36 - was being on Discord and being able to
37:38 - talk to other people who are also
37:40 - attending the hiring Summit and saying I
37:42 - connected with this company with this
37:44 - person you need you need to go check
37:45 - this out um you know they're they're
37:48 - doing like all these different things um
37:50 - so I think it's just nice you know to
37:52 - have your community rally rally behind
37:55 - you you know as you're finding your path
37:56 - to
37:57 - success I do want to recognize too um
38:01 - and I should have addressed this before
38:03 - but in in my role I cover neurodiversity
38:05 - and I cover persons with disabilities
38:07 - and when we talk about events like this
38:08 - and we talk about these very robust
38:10 - pipelines and networks I often go back
38:13 - and I'm like this is way too much I'm
38:15 - overstimulated I don't know what to do
38:17 - where to go this is I I can barely pull
38:19 - my thoughts together in a regular day
38:21 - this is just me personally and so for
38:24 - for folks that may be on on the spe
38:26 - similarly right and have to have a very
38:29 - very concrete plan make it your
38:31 - intention again that word is so
38:33 - important your intention to just connect
38:34 - with one additional person right so if
38:38 - if my efforts are focused on I need to
38:40 - connect with one additional person right
38:42 - let me just that's my intention connect
38:45 - with that one additional person have a
38:47 - conversation and that may be
38:49 - virtual that may be in whatever way is
38:52 - conducive to you but when you set your
38:54 - intention on that one goal for me the
38:56 - way my mind works is I can execute
38:58 - against that goal and once I hit that
38:59 - goal I'm able to then move forward next
39:02 - so I met with one person who I'm calmed
39:04 - down what can I do more what more can I
39:06 - do or similar to what we had talked
39:09 - about before maybe I shut my computer
39:10 - for a little bit and take some time to
39:12 - recharge but this can be an
39:15 - overstimulating process this could be an
39:17 - over stimulating Network you're talking
39:19 - with a ton of people take your time
39:22 - breathe pace yourself especially in an
39:24 - interview think about what you're going
39:26 - going to say think about what you want
39:28 - to say and one tip that I always give my
39:30 - the folks that I interview and used to
39:32 - interview in my past life was it's okay
39:34 - to take a beat to say thank you for that
39:37 - question would you mind giving me a few
39:39 - seconds to pull my thoughts together
39:40 - nothing wrong it doesn't show that
39:42 - you're incapable and adequate it
39:43 - actually shows great strength and and
39:45 - mental ability um and so slow down take
39:48 - a second in that intentionality and if
39:50 - you need a second to think in that
39:52 - interview ask for it um and and that way
39:55 - you have that space But just want to
39:57 - recognize that this is an
39:59 - overstimulating process and that there
40:00 - are ways to navigate do your best um and
40:04 - just do one more right do your best and
40:07 - reach for one more and that's success as
40:12 - well thank you Adonis I think that was
40:15 - like really important to bring up um I
40:18 - also wanted to say that if you do feel
40:20 - overwhelmed um it's okay to not go to
40:25 - all of the boots and not talk to every
40:27 - single recruiter um it would be great if
40:30 - you could do that and if you can't um
40:33 - that's okay too um and if you feel like
40:37 - you're missing opportunities what I like
40:40 - to do is um kind of again just note down
40:43 - contact information for recruiters and
40:46 - then reach out to them in the next
40:48 - couple of days while they still actively
40:51 - looking at people from The
40:55 - Summit
40:58 - absolutely thank you all and we have one
41:01 - last question for our panelists before
41:03 - we turn over to Q&A um and that is as we
41:08 - speak about you know just really making
41:10 - the most of this experience um what
41:12 - information should job Seekers make note
41:15 - of when they're visiting booths um and
41:18 - engaging with recruiters and also a
41:21 - followup to that if you know you have
41:23 - any pointers on how can they use this
41:25 - information most effectively in the
41:27 - later stages of their job
41:36 - search I can jump in um first I'll give
41:41 - a a unique answer and then I'll give
41:43 - like a a cookie cutter kind of response
41:45 - that I still Ed to this day the first
41:47 - unique answer which is not a real road
41:48 - map what do you want to know and and
41:51 - what is important for you to know when I
41:53 - started my job search even later on in
41:54 - my career what was important to me was
41:56 - ways of working compensation not just
42:00 - diversity initiatives but what that
42:02 - looked like in real time so can I can we
42:04 - talk about your CSR Corporate social
42:06 - responsibility report can you yourself
42:08 - as a representative of the organization
42:11 - talk about your diversity initiatives
42:13 - across the board what might that look
42:15 - like right so those things were
42:17 - important to me when I was in college
42:19 - looking for roles it was kind of like
42:22 - what role what are you going to pay me
42:23 - like what is the role doing like what
42:25 - what is happen and so in terms of what
42:28 - you should leverage from a company's
42:29 - information standpoint is what you want
42:31 - to know and what you want to gain and
42:33 - what's beneficial for you so that's the
42:35 - unique answer and that can be anything
42:38 - that is important to you um that you
42:40 - would need in order to accept an offer
42:43 - later on down the line from this
42:44 - organization now the cookie cutter piece
42:46 - of it is to every company majority of
42:49 - companies have either a fact sheet or a
42:52 - like fact website or About Us website on
42:56 - about the company and because we're
42:57 - virtual you have access to Google like
42:59 - the whole day go to their about section
43:01 - and just read up on the company high
43:03 - level read up and then themes will start
43:06 - popping out of you okay you're a global
43:08 - organization you're promote from within
43:10 - strategy these are your clients okay
43:13 - what work do you do with those clients
43:15 - and and what might that look like or
43:16 - what's the average tenure in management
43:19 - and what's your recruitment strategy you
43:21 - know what I mean so it starts pulling
43:22 - out themes and the about that you can
43:24 - ask but what's incredibly important to
43:27 - you may not be incredibly important to
43:28 - me and so um go start think about your
43:33 - wants what do you want out of a career
43:36 - so make a list this is an exercise we do
43:38 - with my team all the time every quarter
43:40 - make a list of your wants what do I want
43:42 - out of a career make a list of your
43:44 - needs what do I need out of a career
43:46 - because then I need a company that gives
43:48 - me what I need and some of if not most
43:51 - of what I want and so that'll start
43:53 - crafting a little bit of the questions
43:54 - that you would want to ask and what you
43:56 - would really want to know and have fun
43:57 - with it right but don't waste your time
44:01 - because your time is valuable asking
44:03 - questions that don't matter to
44:12 - you yeah I think that's super important
44:15 - and I also think it's important to
44:18 - because you have access to all of these
44:21 - amazing people who are working in
44:23 - companies you really want to be at I
44:25 - think think it's important to kind of
44:28 - keep their information or connect with
44:31 - them um at a later
44:37 - Point nothing else to add here I think
44:40 - Adonis summed it up
44:44 - perfectly fantastic thank you all so
44:46 - much for your Insight so uh we do have a
44:49 - couple of questions from our audience so
44:51 - we'll move over to those remember uh for
44:54 - everyone joining us if you have
44:56 - questions uh you would like to ask just
44:58 - drop it in that uh Q&A box at the bottom
45:00 - of your screen uh so the first question
45:04 - for our panelists um how do you deal
45:07 - with the heaviness of job
45:15 - searching h i can jump in um it is
45:19 - daunting um as a person who works in
45:24 - Tech um it's doubly dating with the ups
45:27 - and downs and just the news um I think
45:32 - there are good days and there are bad
45:34 - days and I think um it's important to
45:38 - understand that uh there are a lot of
45:41 - factors that are in play here and you
45:45 - might get a lot of
45:47 - rejections and that's not a reflection
45:50 - on your abilities or your skills and
45:53 - your capabilities it's just the
45:55 - environment I think it's really
45:57 - important to um believe in
45:59 - yourself um right now and um take your
46:03 - time I would say that it is daunting
46:07 - you're not alone and it is heavy so just
46:11 - acknowledge that it is a hard thing that
46:13 - you're going through believe in yourself
46:15 - and realize that it's not a reflection
46:18 - of um your skill side
46:23 - always I agree with all of that 100%
46:26 - pace yourself right so um I'm a big
46:29 - strategy person so build out a strategy
46:31 - you're G to have rejection right it's
46:33 - going to be hard um it may be a long
46:35 - road for a lot of folks those are those
46:37 - are facts that we can't get around right
46:40 - um the thing about it and I my dad gave
46:42 - me this advice when I was younger you
46:44 - have enough time to do what you're put
46:46 - here to do right and so that right
46:48 - opportunity though it may take a little
46:50 - bit of fighting you may lose time you
46:53 - may lose sleep you may lose money the
46:54 - right opportunity will find its way to
46:57 - you in the right timing but there are
46:59 - things that you can do to supplement
47:02 - that process to make that finding in
47:03 - that matching piece easier such as
47:06 - connections that you make here it may
47:08 - not just be the connection that you make
47:09 - with the recruiter or the representative
47:11 - but tap into who the recruiter the
47:14 - posting recruiter is on that role on
47:16 - LinkedIn DM that recruiter on LinkedIn
47:19 - go through your network your your
47:21 - Collegiate Network go to your University
47:23 - figure out who's connected where so it
47:26 - becomes a little bit of a game because I
47:27 - was in this state I had quit my job had
47:29 - this big corporate career was great I
47:31 - was burnt out after Co I quit my job I
47:33 - traveled three months with my dog it was
47:34 - great but I was ready to hop back into
47:37 - an industry that wasn't ready right
47:40 - wasn't prepared um and so I went through
47:42 - the job search and and did all of that
47:44 - but I set intention as well and I leaned
47:46 - on the networks that I had built and the
47:48 - people that I had met to help supplement
47:50 - and sustain it becomes a game a little
47:52 - bit of a game right to see who in my
47:54 - network can Poss possibly help me don't
47:57 - be afraid to cold call don't cold call
48:00 - like cold message don't be afraid to uh
48:02 - send out don't be afraid to post on
48:04 - LinkedIn don't be afraid to Showcase
48:06 - your your skill sets the fact of the
48:08 - matter is is it's going to be a process
48:10 - and it's not always an easy process um
48:12 - nor is it always fun but in the back of
48:15 - your mind remember I've got enough time
48:17 - to do what I was put here to do and so
48:20 - in that methodology and mindset the
48:22 - right opportunity Finds Its way to you
48:24 - in the right timing but again there's
48:26 - things that you can do to supplement
48:32 - that and also be kind to yourself like
48:36 - be patient with yourself it's not a you
48:39 - problem it's it's really not a you
48:41 - problem 95% of the time that other 5% we
48:44 - can have a one to one about that because
48:46 - I I have I it's a me problem 5% of the
48:48 - time um but be kind with yourself and
48:52 - make sure that you're taking care of
48:53 - yourself in this process right and so
48:56 - shut it out don't don't be scrolling all
48:59 - day don't be doing all of that all day
49:01 - do something that's mentally stimulating
49:03 - for you physic go touch grass I learned
49:05 - that off of Tik Tok and it's been
49:06 - cracking me up like go outside and touch
49:08 - grass um go do that but the process it
49:12 - will be the process will engulf you if
49:14 - you let it um but just be kind to
49:16 - yourself be gentle to yourself it's the
49:18 - industry it's not you most of the
49:24 - time
49:26 - and I would say in that vein there was
49:28 - another question that came up um Natalie
49:31 - not sure if you have may have anything
49:33 - to add but in speaking of you know this
49:36 - being difficult um particularly for
49:39 - those that you know come from a
49:41 - non-traditional background like boot
49:42 - camp are there any ways in which you can
49:45 - you know any tips that you have on how
49:47 - they can combat impostor syndrome or you
49:50 - know maintaining that confidence
49:54 - um
49:56 - I'll jump in here I I've I'm still
49:59 - figuring out that myself um I'm still
50:02 - figuring out uh why um what I was put
50:05 - here to do um I myself come from a
50:08 - non-traditional background so for
50:10 - everyone out there who does not hold the
50:13 - typical computer science degree or does
50:15 - not hold a degree or comes from a boot
50:17 - camp I completely understand um I myself
50:20 - do not have a degree yet I entered the
50:23 - industry um through internships through
50:27 - networking uh through so many
50:29 - opportunities that people have presented
50:31 - to me um because I stepped outside of my
50:34 - comfort zone I struggled with a severe
50:37 - case of impostor syndrome when I left
50:39 - college and one of the hardest things
50:42 - for me to do was to go out to a
50:44 - conference and go to a recruiter and say
50:47 - I come from a non-traditional background
50:49 - and I would love to hear about your
50:51 - opportunities and what and and what
50:53 - you're able to offer somebody to my
50:55 - skill set so I would say that what's
50:57 - been helping me combat it in the last
50:59 - couple of years it's just to focus on my
51:01 - skills and what I can offer and honing
51:03 - in um you know on um on what what excuse
51:09 - me sorry uh losing my train of thought
51:11 - what I'm good at and what can I bring to
51:14 - the table and not and nothing else
51:17 - really mattered to
51:21 - me that story that's the story that's
51:24 - the like Natalie story that you told
51:27 - that makes you valuable and I think we
51:30 - often forget because we're reverse
51:32 - matching right if I don't come through
51:33 - traditionally there's no way but I'll
51:36 - tell you exent you're I work for the
51:38 - number one Tech consulting firm on the
51:41 - planet right one thing that we look for
51:43 - is life experience and that
51:46 - non-traditional background often times
51:48 - so we can supplement both what does that
51:50 - mean that I'm coming in with skill sets
51:52 - I'm coming in with resilience I'm coming
51:55 - in being able to navigate ambiguity I'm
51:57 - coming in knowing how to communicate I
51:59 - had a different path but you see I got
52:01 - from here to here right so that
52:04 - confidence in that story listen to all
52:06 - the skill sets I was resilient right I
52:09 - faced imposter syndrome but I knew that
52:10 - I had the skills I knew that I was good
52:13 - and so when you're talking to companies
52:15 - we often forget we as candidates forget
52:18 - that we're actually the prize like we
52:21 - are the asset companies cannot move
52:23 - without people we're a big gen AI
52:25 - company a big innovation ai ai can't
52:29 - exist without human Ingenuity right so
52:31 - we still need people we are actually the
52:33 - price like we are the priz here and so
52:35 - when you come to the table not cocky but
52:37 - understanding that I've got something to
52:39 - offer that may be different right but
52:43 - it's still Innovative it's still
52:46 - impactful that gets me excited and that
52:48 - should get you excited to talk about all
52:50 - of the things that you overcame and had
52:53 - to loop back around and learn to get
52:55 - where you are now also on the other end
52:57 - that story is still the same going
52:59 - through a traditional background right
53:01 - and having the same same experiences but
53:04 - that story itself is a value ad for any
53:08 - type of role right um and so just lean
53:11 - on being confident in what you know you
53:14 - have to offer and don't go to these
53:16 - events waiting for us to tell you who
53:18 - you are waiting for a company to tell
53:20 - you yep you're valuable or yep that
53:21 - that's accurate come to the table
53:24 - knowing that what you have is valuable
53:26 - and that just makes it fun because I'm
53:28 - not waiting for you to to to make me
53:30 - feel valuable I know that I'm valuable
53:31 - I'm waiting to see how our value can
53:33 - then match up together for something
53:39 - greater um I would like to add that
53:42 - sometimes you're not at the same level
53:45 - at other like as other people are like
53:48 - you might be starting out coding and you
53:50 - see a lot of people around you who have
53:51 - been coding for like 10 years and you
53:53 - get overwhelmed but you're not at the
53:56 - same level as them and that's okay it's
53:59 - completely fine if you're not at the
54:02 - same you're not in the same chapter as
54:05 - everybody else and what's more important
54:07 - than like things that you learn by
54:11 - actually doing them is that the things
54:13 - that you get to the table like your
54:16 - passion your creativity your the way you
54:20 - think I think those things are very
54:22 - important and just because you haven't
54:24 - written 500 lines of production code
54:27 - doesn't make you any less of an engineer
54:31 - than somebody who
54:36 - has I am so inspired um I have to say
54:40 - and we do have one last question before
54:43 - we move on to our closing for the night
54:45 - we've talked about it a lot um but our
54:47 - attendees want to know can they connect
