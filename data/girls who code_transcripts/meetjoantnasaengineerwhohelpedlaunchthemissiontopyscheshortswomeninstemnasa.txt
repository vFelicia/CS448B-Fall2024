00:00 - what will you be working on yeah it's a
00:02 - super exciting time right now the test
00:05 - bed is closely following behind the
00:07 - psyche spacecraft as it progresses
00:09 - through the launch procedure my shift
00:11 - begins when we first communicate to the
00:13 - spacecraft since liftoff and this is
00:15 - done through something called commands
00:17 - Now commands are directions that we give
00:19 - to the spacecraft which we tell it what
00:21 - to do and what kind of inform of
00:23 - information that we need from it the
00:26 - room will be making sure that the
00:28 - spacecraft is in a safe state while the
00:30 - test beds are sending the same commands
00:32 - and simulating the same data that we
00:34 - would get from the spacecraft if anyone
00:36 - in the team or in the room was curious
00:38 - about a specific command we would first
00:40 - test it on the test bed to see that we
00:42 - get the expected response
