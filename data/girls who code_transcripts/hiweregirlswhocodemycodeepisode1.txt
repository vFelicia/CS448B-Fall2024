00:09 - Brittany I'm Margo we're girls to code
00:11 - and this is our show my code each week
00:14 - you'll hear from us about what it's like
00:15 - to be a girl who code as well as some
00:16 - tips and tricks about learning computer
00:19 - science in my free time I'm a
00:22 - cheerleader a boy scout and it also
00:24 - teach kids in my local community how to

00:47 - because I love creating things I want to
00:50 - understand how the apps on my phone work
00:51 - or how my favorite social media sites
00:54 - like Facebook function I learned to code
00:56 - because it gave me the potential career
00:58 - in life I've never thought of before
01:00 - I've always loved games like flappy bird
01:02 - and rolling sky at the time it seemed
01:05 - like magic when I learned that they made
01:07 - this stuff through code and then I could
01:09 - learn the code that they used I thought
01:12 - why not learn it coding lets me create
01:13 - literally anything I could imagine
01:15 - just like typing into my computer I can
01:17 - create the next Facebook Sims or simply
01:21 - code a robot that can perform amazing
01:22 - surgeries
01:26 - I just remember technology always being
01:28 - a huge part in my life I've always been
01:30 - fascinated with technology even when I

01:35 - how do planes stay in the air how do
01:36 - people make movies
01:37 - why do microwaves get hot how was it
01:39 - possible that with the swipe of a finger
01:41 - and a push of a button all these cool
01:43 - animations would pop up but I always
01:45 - thought the actual technology behind it
01:47 - and the actual coding would be too
01:49 - difficult to understand the fear of
01:50 - coding was only in my head and I
01:52 - shouldn't let that stop me girl should
01:57 - learn how to code because we're a
01:58 - minority in this field since computer
02:00 - science is dominated by men not a lot of
02:03 - products are created for the needs of
02:04 - women code allows you to be as open
02:06 - creative and expressive as you can be
02:08 - but as more women join the field we can
02:10 - have a larger set once you know how to
02:12 - code you become instantly way more
02:14 - valuable for all kinds of jobs software
02:16 - engineering genetics biology even know
02:18 - coding may seem hard and difficult to
02:20 - understand it's actually very fun you
02:23 - can create your own personal website or
02:25 - an app that all your friends can
02:26 - download from the App Store technology

02:38 - you they want you so you should go out
02:40 - and take those opportunities thanks so
02:42 - much for tuning into our very first
02:44 - episode of my code we'll be back next
02:46 - week to talk about what it's like to be
02:47 - a girl who codes questions you can leave
02:50 - those in the comment section below and
02:51 - I'll see you next week bye guys thanks
