05:44 - val and folks in the chat feel free to

05:56 - was um was sitting in arcades or pizza
06:00 - joints
06:01 - with my dad and playing the likes of our
06:04 - atari classics like centipede and
06:06 - pac-man
06:08 - but uh but fast forward a bit i would
06:10 - have to say when it was i got my first
06:12 - console which was an nes
06:15 - so again taking it way back you guys to
06:18 - the super mario brothers days and it was
06:20 - great because it was pre-multiplayer
06:22 - experience
06:24 - so
06:24 - your multiplayer experience was your
06:26 - friend sat next to you
06:28 - in the room and so we play together
06:30 - learn the game together
06:33 - die replay learn it you know peruse the
06:36 - nintendo magazine together so those were
06:38 - those one of my favorite um super mario
06:41 - definitely one of my favorites
06:43 - i love it um and how about you diana
06:47 - so for me um
06:48 - i
06:50 - my family and i we moved uh
06:52 - we moved from the jamaica republic to
06:53 - the united states and we didn't have
06:55 - that we didn't go anywhere and we were
06:58 - and we moved to louisiana in the middle
07:00 - of nowhere and so we really didn't
07:03 - socialize how about very much of
07:05 - anything so we had video games and so my
07:07 - dad they said so either my dad or my mom
07:10 - i don't know which one but most likely
07:11 - my dad uh brought in an atari uh an
07:15 - atari like 7 800 or something like that
07:18 - and then um that was uh that was how we
07:20 - played um and then
07:23 - once we got the nintendo like all bets
07:24 - were off like that's i mean we were we
07:26 - were at the cutting edge of technology
07:29 - there uh and so it was fantastic so we
07:33 - um and so my favorite game uh to play
07:35 - was the legend of zelda um and i played
07:37 - it with my mom and so my mom would say
07:40 - you know i'd come back i come home from
07:42 - school and she'd go do you need to
07:44 - finish your homework and of course i
07:45 - finished my homework uh fantastic and
07:48 - then once i was done with my homework uh
07:50 - she was like okay let's play and so we
07:52 - would
07:52 - we played uh we played the legend of
07:54 - zelda and that was fantastic and awesome
07:57 - and a great memory
07:59 - uh i love it and i don't know if you can
08:01 - tell but the enthusiasm coming through
08:03 - in the chat
08:04 - everyone has an answer to this question
08:06 - um i'll answer for myself i think it was
08:08 - natasha maybe earlier who said sims i
08:12 - was a sims kid i used to like have to go
08:14 - to bed and then everyone would go to
08:16 - sleep and i would sneak back downstairs
08:18 - because there was some milestone that
08:20 - was about to happen in my sims game
08:22 - somebody was going to age up or get
08:24 - married or get a promotion at work and i
08:27 - just like
08:28 - man it was so addictive that feeling i i
08:30 - have to admit during uh the height of
08:32 - the pandemic i re-downloaded sims
08:35 - and it's uh it's still there i don't
08:37 - know
08:39 - any other sims folks we do in the chat
08:43 - sport has taken so much of my money i
08:46 - understand that
08:47 - so i i want to start us here because
08:50 - this is such you can see the enthusiasm
08:52 - both from youtube the panelists but also
08:54 - in the chat people love games they love
08:57 - playing games it makes them feel good it
08:58 - makes them feel creative makes them feel
09:00 - connected and i think one of the most
09:02 - exciting things to think about for our
09:04 - community at girls who code is how you
09:06 - might take your love of games and turn
09:09 - it into a career
09:10 - and we talk all the time at girls who
09:13 - code oh minecraft excellent choice
09:15 - ariana we talk at girls who code all the
09:18 - time about how you know when you think
09:20 - of computer science you think i have to
09:22 - be an engineer and i probably have to
09:23 - work at google like that's the path
09:25 - right
09:26 - if i'm interested in tech or computer
09:28 - science
09:29 - that's what i'm supposed to do and
09:30 - that's by the way an awesome path if
09:32 - that's the path you go
09:34 - but there's so many roles in the tech
09:36 - industry that you can have
09:38 - and there's so many places to do that
09:40 - work and i want to start by really
09:42 - understanding your job titles so diana i
09:45 - want to start with you here you are a
09:47 - licensing production manager for star
09:50 - wars at zynga tell us what that means
09:55 - so um
09:57 - so it's kind of to rewind a little bit
09:59 - how you said uh
10:02 - you know not having like
10:04 - uh not really having like your standard
10:06 - sort of engineering um engineering role
10:09 - um that was never that was never me um
10:11 - so i like to say that my career has been
10:13 - kind of windy um i think
10:16 - folks think that
10:18 - in order to be in the gaming industry
10:20 - like you said you need to be like an
10:21 - engineer or you need to uh
10:24 - a code in some in some particular way um
10:27 - but i'm kind of i like to say that i'm
10:29 - kind of proof that's not true um
10:32 - i i actually
10:34 - my my my degree in college was i went to
10:37 - i went to college for musical theater um
10:39 - so um i like to say that i can sing
10:41 - dance and act at the same time and i
10:45 - have a degree to prove it hey
10:48 - so uh so i i
10:50 - i that's that's what i did for like the
10:52 - first couple of years of my life
10:55 - uh theater kid yes um
10:58 - uh because and you know what's funny is
11:01 - that theater kids uh
11:03 - there are a lot of theater kids in the
11:06 - um gaming industry um i think it's just
11:09 - because it's just because it's a
11:10 - creative it's another creative outlet um
11:13 - it's artsy as somebody said in in the
11:15 - chat um it's so it's a way to sort of
11:18 - transfer your skills obviously i'm not
11:20 - you know singing singing and dancing i
11:22 - mean debatable if you know me in in the
11:25 - in the office i'm usually doing that on
11:27 - the in the hallways but like um
11:30 - but when it comes to like the
11:32 - relationship uh relationship building
11:34 - when it comes to the interpersonal
11:36 - relationships because when you're
11:37 - creating a a a show and you're putting a
11:40 - show on broadway or off-broadway or you
11:43 - know um in in my case you mentioned a a
11:45 - video game tv show it was like on public
11:47 - access in you know ups in like new
11:50 - rochelle um past the bronx new york and
11:52 - so
11:53 - that's
11:54 - when you're putting together a show
11:56 - you're all kind of working together and
11:58 - you're working towards a common goal and
12:00 - putting it out there so that folks uh
12:02 - can enjoy and that's really like the
12:04 - core thing of theater and you're all
12:07 - coming together and you're kind of like
12:08 - a family and um really that's uh that's
12:12 - that's the gaming industry and it and it
12:14 - really really translates and i try to
12:16 - explain that to folks because um i used
12:18 - to i used to actually i used to actually
12:20 - downplay uh that you know when i when i
12:23 - first started in the industry and and
12:25 - then i realized wait a minute like all
12:27 - of the skills that i learned working um
12:29 - in in um in theater and performing in
12:32 - theater all translate to this
12:35 - now that was a very long way
12:37 - of saying what my job is
12:40 - my job is um i take
12:42 - um that i'm kind of like
12:44 - if i want to use a theater term i'm kind
12:46 - of like a sort of a stage manager of
12:49 - some sort let's use it let's use that um
12:52 - where uh in a very very loose way where
12:54 - i need to sort of um
12:56 - i work with everybody i touch everything
12:58 - so i need to work with engineers i need
13:00 - to work with the artists i need to work
13:03 - with uh producers um the executives the
13:07 - vice president like the high the high
13:09 - people as well um people who own uh who
13:12 - who run the company so i need to work
13:14 - with everybody i need to be able to sort
13:16 - of like you know adjust how i talk to
13:19 - when i'm talking to an engineer um when
13:21 - i'm talking to an artist when i'm
13:22 - talking to um you know a narrative
13:24 - designer um i also need to know
13:27 - uh i need to know uh the stories and i
13:29 - need to know the characters um
13:31 - and so i kind of interact with all that
13:34 - internally at zynga but then also
13:38 - to add an extra layer i'm also
13:40 - interacting with the people at
13:42 - lucasfilm
13:44 - for star wars so i'm interacting with
13:47 - all those those same exact folks
13:49 - um in um
13:51 - at lucasfilm and then also like taking
13:54 - like their feedback and any sort of
13:56 - questions that they may have about the
13:58 - production about the show that's
14:00 - not the show back in theater terms in
14:02 - the game uh that were that we're making
14:05 - and bringing and bringing that back to
14:07 - make sure that like we're honoring or
14:10 - honoring uh the star wars uh the star
14:12 - wars property um and then also giving
14:15 - the studio uh the power and the creative
14:18 - agency to be creative and to be awesome
14:20 - and to make awesome games um so
14:23 - that was a very long long-winded way of
14:25 - saying what my job is but um i like to
14:28 - say that i'm the glue that connects
14:29 - everybody everybody together and a
14:31 - cheerleader
14:32 - i love that and i i love a few things
14:34 - about it you know people think of
14:36 - working in tech sometimes is really
14:37 - isolating like oh i just sit at my
14:38 - computer and i code all day right and in
14:41 - fact depending on your role it might be
14:42 - really collaborative it might rely on
14:44 - communication it might be really
14:46 - creative
14:48 - um you know it's not necessarily just
14:50 - you in a dark room coding unless it's
14:52 - problem solving yeah it's also problem
14:54 - solving you know it's also being you
14:56 - know understanding kindness um i think
14:59 - people
14:59 - there are too many hard skills that
15:02 - people think about when they think about
15:04 - going into the gaming industry and even
15:06 - in just in jobs in general and soft
15:08 - skills like thinking about you know
15:10 - collaboration and and kindness and and
15:14 - understanding and patience these are all
15:17 - things with all different kinds of
15:18 - people right
15:20 - exactly
15:21 - thank you um that's i'm i'm excited to
15:24 - learn more as we go on today um val okay
15:26 - similarly you have this title director
15:29 - of strategy comma product innovation for
15:32 - merkel a densu company i don't know how
15:34 - any of this fits on a business card but
15:36 - tell us what that means
15:38 - well the good news is we don't really
15:40 - have business cards anymore right
15:43 - so so linkedin and twitter give you the
15:45 - character limit right
15:48 - um
15:49 - but yeah so um
15:51 - basically my role at merkel is really
15:54 - kind of uncovering cultural trends uh
15:57 - working with teams similar to diana um
16:00 - you know what uh all cross-functional
16:03 - teams right so it's like designers
16:05 - engineers um even subject matter
16:09 - experts as well in different areas
16:12 - um and so wearing multiple hats
16:16 - as well but really in addition to kind
16:18 - of uncovering those cultural trends it's
16:21 - also creating new products and services
16:23 - for our company
16:25 - but also teaming up with our clients to
16:27 - help them
16:28 - uncover those opportunities as well as
16:31 - early prototypes on new products that
16:33 - they might come up with and i'm really
16:35 - fortunate that i've worked with such
16:36 - great brands like hasbro and mattel
16:40 - where play
16:41 - um and mixing and merging not only
16:45 - physical toys
16:47 - and games but also now that we're living
16:49 - in a connected world um connected
16:52 - experiences so how does this physical
16:53 - toy engage whether it's an app play
16:56 - experience whether it's a gamified
16:58 - experience um you know i think everybody
17:01 - heard all about the travis scott
17:04 - fortnight
17:05 - event that happened during the pandemic
17:08 - well what was really cool about that is
17:10 - um you know you had brands like hasbro
17:13 - who are launching a physical product
17:16 - um at the same time that this event was
17:18 - happening in fortnight and uh
17:22 - launched all on the same day and that
17:24 - involved a ton of different people right
17:27 - so that's everybody from like a
17:29 - uh industrial designer who's making that
17:32 - nerf blaster you know to the
17:34 - manufacturer to oh by the way the folks
17:37 - over at epic right launching that
17:40 - experience as well and coordinating you
17:43 - know all of the different bits and
17:45 - pieces
17:46 - um
17:47 - and then in terms of how i started my
17:50 - career so i've always i've always been a
17:53 - nerd a digital techie whatever person at
17:57 - heart
17:58 - i mean like i told y'all back back when
18:00 - i was a little kid playing playing
18:02 - pac-man and centipede uh but my career
18:05 - didn't take me straight to gaming so
18:07 - just like diana's it's like
18:09 - i didn't i didn't start in gaming um
18:13 - my first actually
18:15 - my first first role out of university um
18:19 - it was at uh a agency in london an
18:23 - advertising agency and at the time
18:26 - you had sort of traditional advertising
18:28 - you had like tv you know and blast all
18:31 - these sort of ads everywhere and then
18:33 - there was like this relatively new thing

18:41 - was you know called to come in they
18:43 - wanted to make me an offer i i and this

18:47 - down there and i'm wearing like one of
18:50 - my
18:51 - three sort of nice
18:53 - suits that i bought
18:54 - myself went down there looking all nice
18:57 - and then uh and this lady she was sort
18:59 - of like wincing and making all these
19:01 - faces and all these emotions i'm like
19:03 - did i get the job i mean y'all called me
19:06 - down here
19:08 - and so
19:09 - so she's like well
19:11 - you know everybody loved you and they
19:13 - thought you're great but
19:15 - and i'm like my gosh say it
19:17 - she's like we only have the digital
19:20 - opportunity
19:21 - you know and i was like oh that's cool
19:24 - that's the future like that's completely
19:26 - cool
19:28 - yeah and so it was great in that um i
19:31 - was able to um
19:33 - actually the team were really open
19:35 - because we were creating things that
19:36 - hadn't been done before whether it was
19:39 - new technologies content management
19:42 - systems how people interact with
19:45 - physical and digital products
19:47 - um
19:48 - and so i had a lot of autonomy and i was
19:51 - able to
19:53 - work with cross-functional teams and
19:55 - learn from them
19:57 - so i was really thankful for the
19:58 - experience
19:59 - and it's
20:01 - i love that you use the word windy diana
20:03 - to describe your career and now val
20:05 - you're telling the story where it like
20:06 - took a hard left where the job you
20:08 - thought was going to be available maybe
20:09 - wasn't and those kinds of things happen
20:11 - it's not a straight line right
20:13 - especially when you work on the cutting
20:14 - edge in technology and gaming and
20:17 - creative fields there's always new stuff
20:19 - to learn
20:20 - and i actually wanted to ask you both
20:22 - work kind of adjacent to the technical
20:24 - work you talked about working with
20:25 - engineers communicating with technical
20:28 - folks you know value talked about
20:29 - working in internet of things and ar and
20:31 - vr
20:32 - when you have to learn a new technology
20:35 - like let's say you're starting on a
20:36 - project that you're not really familiar
20:38 - and you've got to learn how to speak the
20:40 - language learn the basics like how do
20:43 - you approach that maybe we can start
20:44 - with you on this one bell
20:47 - yeah i mean in terms of any any new
20:50 - technology that's out there you know i
20:52 - really just try and
20:54 - educate myself on it because it's it's
20:57 - new
20:58 - right so like people don't always know
21:00 - how to talk about it i think about way
21:03 - back in the day
21:04 - um when the internet became popular
21:09 - it was like people didn't know how to
21:10 - talk about it they called it the world
21:12 - wide web they called it the information
21:14 - super highway like how many words is
21:16 - that to say i mean now it's just the
21:19 - internet right you just or go online
21:21 - um and so at that time like
21:24 - we were learning how to talk about it
21:26 - and even with mobile phones when those
21:29 - became common you know people would say
21:32 - oh do you have a cellular phone like no
21:35 - one talks like that anymore
21:36 - so
21:38 - um
21:38 - so i think it's it's basically you know
21:41 - for me it's it's learning about it i
21:44 - also write as well and so um i'm always
21:46 - looking at like how are people talking
21:49 - about things and then when i'm writing
21:51 - and researching and talking about these
21:53 - new things as they come out
21:56 - i always want to make it as easy for
21:58 - people to understand as possible um when
22:01 - i'm communicating out so i try and
22:03 - absorb how others are talking about it
22:05 - and distill it down into like just
22:07 - regular people language you know uh
22:11 - and yeah so that's my my take
22:14 - i love it how about you diana when you
22:16 - encounter some new technology and and
22:18 - you have to learn the ropes
22:20 - yeah i mean i'm whenever uh and this has
22:24 - always been been a constant for me it
22:27 - was like
22:28 - always have a natural sort of curiosity
22:31 - towards things
22:32 - and so i uh
22:34 - much like that i kind of
22:36 - do do the research i research about it i
22:39 - read about it i also ask asked around
22:42 - like hey what do you know about this um
22:44 - and then uh
22:45 - occasionally uh check out a couple of
22:47 - youtube videos if anything anything
22:49 - exists about it so
22:50 - i i like i i i read
22:53 - a lot
22:54 - and um and then also uh depending on the
22:57 - on the form of technology um i'll either
23:00 - like uh purchase it or like uh or or ask
23:03 - somebody hey can i uh come come over to
23:06 - your place and use it um like in the in
23:08 - the
23:10 - vr for example like
23:11 - when it first when it was first coming
23:13 - out um
23:15 - for for a home um
23:17 - and i was sort of debating it i had a
23:19 - friend who who
23:20 - who was programming for it and i was
23:22 - like can i just swing by and just like
23:24 - check out your your oculus or whatever
23:26 - like what can i just check that out so i
23:28 - just you know i would do that as well so
23:31 - i
23:32 - really really make the effort to um to
23:34 - educate myself and just and just learn
23:36 - it and then sometimes i just jump in
23:37 - like for example when i worked at
23:38 - ubisoft um
23:40 - i was using um they have a proprietary
23:43 - uh uh
23:45 - platform that they use uh called
23:47 - snowdrop and so um that's that's not
23:50 - available anywhere unless you work at
23:52 - ubisoft and so i was like oh okay so
23:55 - this is pretty cool um
23:57 - it kind of you know kind of unique let
23:59 - me try it out and it was and so you know
24:02 - so like i would i would take like my
24:03 - lunch times in a couple a couple of
24:05 - hours uh you know throughout the week
24:07 - and and i and i jump in and i and i try
24:10 - and i try things out and i even like i
24:13 - i even went to like the audio team um
24:16 - and i was like hey i heard y'all needed
24:18 - help um i have some free time uh what
24:22 - can i do and they were like oh we need
24:24 - somebody to add steps in the game and i
24:26 - was like
24:28 - sign me up
24:30 - i will be the step person 100
24:33 - and so that's what i did and so the
24:35 - steps that you hear in in the game that
24:37 - was me i did that
24:40 - so that's so that's it it's really neat
24:42 - and uh and so that's that's what i did
24:44 - and um and that's what i edit what i
24:45 - normally do is i just jump in and learn
24:48 - i love it and i love that you mentioned
24:49 - like youtube videos and googling and
24:51 - reading people think that engineers like
24:53 - somehow memorize everything no no
24:56 - everybody is googling everybody's
24:58 - watching youtube videos everybody's
25:00 - looking it up on stack overflow right
25:03 - and i don't know if you can see in the
25:04 - um in the chat i asked folks what
25:06 - they're learning and everybody is
25:07 - teaching themselves something right now
25:09 - we have folks learning python we have
25:11 - powershell somebody else said what is
25:13 - powershell i love that we're all
25:14 - learning new stuff i'm learning react
25:17 - i'm making a visual novel game using
25:19 - python oh my god kayla sounds amazing
25:21 - that's so cool
25:23 - um free code camp is an amazing resource
25:25 - there's so many of these so i just want
25:26 - to thank everybody who's been sharing
25:28 - resources in the chat
25:29 - um i want to talk about the industry a
25:31 - little bit game development is a huge
25:33 - umbrella and i would love to know about
25:36 - like what are the trends that you see in
25:39 - the field so most of the folks listening
25:41 - in not everybody is in college or
25:42 - recently graduating and if they're
25:44 - thinking about like where is this going
25:46 - what roles and fields might i consider i
25:50 - would love to know as an insider what
25:51 - you think the options are and if you
25:53 - could also talk about some of the big
25:55 - buckets of types of work right like
25:57 - engineering is a bucket design is a
25:59 - bucket uh product marketing and
26:01 - licensing and i don't even know what all
26:03 - the other buckets are um diana i'm just
26:06 - ping-ponging back and forth here tell us
26:08 - about your thoughts on the industry at
26:09 - the moment
26:10 - uh i think they were at a very exciting
26:12 - moment in the industry i actually just
26:14 - did a licensing um a licensing twitter
26:17 - spaces uh last that last week
26:20 - time has no meaning i don't remember yes
26:22 - so that yes it was last week um where we
26:25 - where we talked about you know the
26:26 - future of licensing and and um
26:30 - and uh and partnerships and how you know
26:33 - companies uh in some cases these you
26:36 - know like i use i use my example like in
26:39 - my case like uh like zynga star wars um
26:42 - lucasfilm uh slash disney slash marvel
26:45 - such those guys um and how how these
26:48 - particular uh companies are are starting
26:50 - to sort of branch out into um not just
26:54 - being a part of gaming and not just also
26:56 - uh not just doing movies either but also
26:59 - getting into gaming and not just also
27:00 - doing gaming but also how that kind of
27:02 - connects
27:03 - into
27:05 - um like somebody mentioned gummy bears
27:07 - like they're like licensing gummy bears
27:09 - like
27:11 - yeah i know right
27:12 - with like
27:13 - with like the character faces so things
27:15 - like that like you know so you see that
27:17 - you see that everywhere um but now
27:19 - you're starting to see these like major
27:22 - um video game companies starting to move
27:24 - in into that so like ubisoft as an
27:27 - example um is starting to uh like moved
27:30 - into uh tv film even though they've
27:33 - they've had movies even though they've
27:34 - uh they've they've done um
27:37 - they've licensed things out now they
27:39 - actively are like wait a minute we
27:41 - should we don't have to give it to
27:42 - anybody else to take like i'm not giving
27:45 - i'm not giving my property or my ip to
27:48 - you now we can actually
27:50 - do all the work we have a humongous
27:53 - amount of talent in our studio oh we
27:56 - could take a narrative designer from
27:58 - this game and they could ride a movie
27:59 - you know so it's like
28:01 - so these are the sort of the sort of
28:03 - ways that um the industry is is
28:06 - expanding in that like it's not just
28:08 - about making video games and so anymore
28:10 - it's sort of making a like a making uh a
28:14 - video game into it is an industry but
28:16 - more
28:17 - um
28:18 - uh
28:19 - more like because when you think of like
28:21 - when you know when you think of like the
28:23 - uh the gaming industry at least some
28:25 - folks still think of it as a young
28:27 - industry and it's not as mature as like
28:30 - movies uh movies and tv and so now like
28:34 - you know the these video game companies
28:36 - are starting to expand and really try to
28:38 - try to mature
28:39 - uh the industry and and that stuff is
28:42 - really really exciting which means that
28:44 - that opens up
28:46 - you know those buckets
28:48 - to not just being an engineer now now
28:51 - they're going to need obviously legal
28:53 - but not just like legal for gaming
28:55 - they're going to need legal for for
28:56 - shoes and legal for food legal for
29:00 - for movies um or or just just lots of
29:04 - different
29:06 - i just muted myself um
29:09 - lots of different uh types of of people
29:12 - um
29:13 - who aren't um
29:14 - who who aren't just um just engineers as
29:17 - well
29:18 - thank you um it's like such an exciting
29:21 - time and it's a growing space right
29:24 - um now what have you noticed about
29:26 - trends in the industry the skills and
29:28 - roles that are available what are you
29:30 - seeing
29:32 - yeah um i loved what diana said about
29:35 - that because i mean
29:37 - in short i would say gaming is the new
29:39 - hollywood right so like you know over
29:42 - time we had it was all about going to
29:45 - the movies watching your favorite tv
29:47 - show
29:48 - but it is completely flipped gaming is
29:51 - influencing culture
29:53 - gaming is influencing ip right so
29:56 - intellectual properties and licensing so
29:58 - that's why there's all of these
30:00 - incredible opportunities out there
30:04 - and what it means is you know as if
30:06 - you're a game designer if you're a
30:08 - writer you know because narrative is
30:11 - really important in terms of like what
30:13 - is that story that happens in the game
30:15 - play
30:16 - so um so if you're a really great writer
30:19 - you know that's that's an ideal
30:20 - opportunity to look at hate maybe it's
30:23 - being becoming a narrative writer in a
30:25 - game
30:26 - um
30:27 - the other thing is in terms of
30:29 - design as well you know there is
30:33 - game design but then we're seeing more
30:35 - things like these virtual events
30:38 - um and also with gaming influencing
30:41 - culture it's also influencing i touched
30:44 - on toys a moment ago like those physical
30:46 - toy plays so that means hey we need toy
30:48 - designers to shape those experiences uh
30:53 - but also events as well right so i know
30:56 - like the world's opening up we just had
30:58 - south by southwest here in austin for
31:01 - the first time since 2019
31:04 - uh gdc right is happening right now
31:08 - right the big game developers conference
31:10 - out in
31:11 - san francisco is happening right now and
31:13 - so all of the the sort of gaming
31:16 - communities there um there's there was
31:19 - an incredible excuse me incredible event
31:21 - prior to covet called game xp
31:25 - down in brazil
31:26 - and it actually had all it has the
31:29 - world's largest esports screen by the
31:31 - way if they ever bring it back
31:33 - amazing how big are we talking
31:35 - i don't have the measurements of it but
31:37 - it is it is uh it is
31:40 - massive and
31:42 - like it is
31:43 - it is a true claim that it is the
31:45 - biggest um
31:47 - but with an event like that bringing
31:50 - um like fortnite into the real world
31:52 - they have like a whole drop thing they
31:54 - had crash bandicoot and they had people
31:56 - on scooters that's right so extending
31:58 - that ip into those physical play
32:01 - experiences um and then i think the
32:03 - other wave of it too to consider is as
32:06 - as new technologies become more
32:08 - accessible right so we're thinking when
32:11 - you think about web ar for example so
32:14 - augmented reality it's all been kind of
32:16 - app-based for a while
32:18 - folks have been experimenting with
32:20 - augmented reality glasses
32:22 - but i think where we're going to see a
32:24 - big experience shift our folks
32:26 - experimenting with um web ar experiences
32:31 - so uh there's company called the eighth
32:34 - wall they were just acquired by niantic
32:36 - who are the creators of pokemon go um
32:39 - and they have a great platform so for
32:41 - those of you who know just a little bit
32:44 - of unity right now
32:46 - um who are kind of experimenting with
32:48 - unity you know you can go on
32:51 - niantic and experiment with light ship
32:54 - if you want to look at kind of creating
32:56 - a
32:57 - make the world your your gamified
32:59 - experience and experiment with that
33:02 - that's one of the big things i really
33:04 - encourage folks to do or some of these
33:06 - tips and
33:08 - tools are completely free and accessible
33:11 - um so really get out there and
33:13 - experiment i i myself i'm not a trained
33:16 - engineer i am not a train coder um we're
33:20 - actually having a chat before the
33:21 - session today and sometimes for
33:24 - for me when i'm trying to communicate an
33:26 - idea i might just experiment with
33:29 - different technologies to
33:31 - um create a light prototype so that i
33:33 - can demonstrate you know with with a
33:36 - designer with um an engineer in order to
33:39 - to realize that idea so
33:42 - um again
33:44 - kind of
33:44 - flipping it gaming is the new hollywood
33:47 - and it's really you know the
33:48 - possibilities are endless
33:51 - i love that um we're getting some
33:53 - questions about like let's say
33:55 - you have an idea for a game like a story
33:58 - or um an arc that you want to experiment
34:01 - with and you know you mentioned unity
34:04 - there's so many technologies out there
34:05 - have either of you seen anything
34:06 - creative about how someone can start
34:10 - building a little prototype or making a
34:12 - little game or what tools or software
34:14 - maybe folks are talking about in that
34:16 - space any ideas for people who just want
34:18 - to kind of mess around and get creative
34:21 - whoever wants to take this one first go
34:23 - for it yeah i think there are there are
34:24 - a lot of uh there are a lot of of of
34:27 - tools out there i mean i think didn't
34:29 - somebody i think mentioned twine uh
34:31 - you know like they were creating a story
34:34 - um
34:36 - a visual novel or something like that
34:38 - which i think is there are a lot of
34:39 - those those uh
34:41 - it really
34:42 - i always tell people that
34:45 - you can always say i want to make a game
34:47 - everybody wants speaking everybody's got
34:49 - an idea to make a game it doesn't matter
34:51 - my mom has an idea to make a game
34:52 - everybody does but like
34:55 - the key
34:58 - is actually doing it
34:59 - and so and actually take making that
35:02 - effort i know that sounds very
35:04 - very silly to say but it's and it's
35:06 - easier said than done but it's really
35:07 - literally just like there are i mean
35:10 - there there are so many uh uh uh uh
35:14 - programs and tools and things that you
35:16 - can do to just make like you can make
35:18 - your own simple game and and create you
35:21 - know a particular
35:23 - uh uh mechanic that is uh that is super
35:26 - interesting that then you could you know
35:28 - bring to
35:29 - uh bring to uh you know a discord that
35:32 - you know that you're in uh where you're
35:34 - talking and you're like hey i have this
35:35 - really great mechanic with where where
35:37 - there are other people and they're like
35:38 - oh let's all let's all
35:40 - let's let's let's make something else
35:42 - and then but the first step is actually
35:45 - like taking that step because everybody
35:48 - can talk talk talk talk talk about it
35:50 - but once you finally move in there
35:52 - um move in and start and start actively
35:54 - like you know
35:56 - doing it then that's that's honestly the
35:59 - the first step in and frankly
36:02 - it really is the hardest step and once
36:04 - you just start you you find that you
36:06 - can't stop
36:07 - um it just sort of tumbles forward and
36:10 - and that that's uh um and that's what i
36:12 - found
36:13 - i'll add one piece before i turn it to
36:15 - val which is just find some friends to
36:18 - do this with because doing this as a
36:19 - group is so much more fun and when you
36:22 - get really frustrated you have people to
36:23 - troubleshoot with um but val what were
36:25 - you going to say
36:27 - yeah i was also just going to say it is
36:29 - it is getting started and it doesn't
36:31 - have to be super complex i think the
36:34 - main thing is just to communicate your
36:36 - idea um
36:38 - it can be even with paper for example
36:40 - you know so if you just wanted to get
36:42 - some sketches together with paper or you
36:44 - know just use google slides and try and
36:47 - you know even if it's like a mood board
36:49 - or
36:51 - some gifs to communicate the idea or
36:54 - even things um
36:56 - you know when i know i was talking about
36:58 - augmented reality and lightship and
37:00 - maybe knowing unity even taking it a
37:03 - step back
37:04 - and experimenting with like snapchat
37:06 - lenses for example
37:08 - and just getting in there and and having
37:11 - a play
37:12 - um and i think too
37:13 - from a game design perspective you know
37:15 - we talked about um obviously video games
37:18 - mobile games augmented reality vr but
37:21 - there's also um connected experiences as
37:24 - well there have been a number of
37:25 - companies who've
37:27 - worked with
37:28 - smart speakers for example so there's
37:31 - things like
37:32 - alexa
37:34 - that you can
37:35 - uh experiment with physical digital play
37:38 - with board game play so hey if you're a
37:40 - board game fan and you're like you're
37:42 - and you have a friend who's like a super
37:44 - into music or into sound i mean you guys
37:46 - get together and and do some
37:48 - experimenting i love that and val i
37:51 - really love your focus on play as like a
37:54 - worthwhile pursuit like that is how you
37:56 - experiment with things that's how you
37:58 - learn
37:59 - that's what keeps it fun i just really
38:01 - love that approach
38:02 - i have one last question and then we'll
38:04 - take a few from the um group the
38:06 - audience so audience folks feel free to
38:08 - drop questions you can put them in the
38:10 - chat or you can drop them in the q a i
38:13 - see a couple already in the q a that
38:15 - i'll try to get to my last question for
38:17 - you too
38:18 - is about a little more practical you're
38:21 - trying to get an internship or a job
38:22 - let's say you're trying to do it in this
38:24 - field
38:25 - you're picking your classes you're
38:27 - looking for summer internships maybe
38:29 - you're teaching yourself some things on
38:31 - the side what practical advice do you
38:33 - have to really prepare yourself to apply
38:36 - for jobs as an early career person in
38:39 - this space
38:40 - diana why don't you take it away to
38:42 - start
38:44 - um
38:45 - can you repeat the question one more
38:46 - time just just so that i don't because
38:48 - there's two different ways that you can
38:49 - interpret that practical advice for
38:52 - getting ready to apply for jobs in this
38:53 - field maybe that's classes to take types
38:56 - of tips to look for skills to build
38:59 - well i mean it really uh that's so
39:01 - that's that's that's actually very a
39:03 - very hard question um simply because
39:05 - that can
39:07 - it really depends on what sort of career
39:10 - path you want to take i mean i i for me
39:13 - um you know i can only use myself as an
39:16 - example um i like to think that every
39:18 - class that i that i took in college in
39:20 - some way uh you know that obviously
39:23 - except for except for that what because
39:25 - i took volleyball like as a passive
39:28 - class so i was like oh i've got an extra
39:29 - credit let me just take volleyball just
39:32 - for fun um
39:33 - so maybe the volleyball may not count
39:36 - but like everything else that i've taken
39:39 - um feeds into
39:41 - uh feeds into like my my experiences um
39:45 - i think that when you have your a
39:47 - specific sort of skill set that you're
39:50 - trying to go into if you're trying to do
39:52 - uh a um
39:54 - like tech art or art um there are
39:57 - obviously there are those those
39:58 - particular courses i always tell people
40:00 - that the best way to go to go forward
40:03 - when when you're um when you're in
40:05 - college in session high school is to
40:07 - really find your find your group like um
40:10 - i mentioned earlier find your find
40:12 - discords um you know there are there are
40:15 - a lot of like uh uh uh um
40:18 - groups like this that that are um
40:21 - that uh have networking um uh
40:25 - networking possibilities where you can
40:26 - connect with other people who can help
40:28 - you uh connect to
40:31 - uh uh connect or guide you um in the
40:34 - direction that you need to go um that
40:36 - you would like to go um and i think that
40:39 - in in your early in your early early
40:42 - days of of your of your career
40:44 - i think the most important thing really
40:46 - is just soaking in as much information
40:48 - as you can um really uh doing um
40:52 - doing things that you're you know in
40:54 - your in your free time in your spare
40:55 - time uh learning uh if for whatever
40:58 - reason you're not you know you're you're
41:00 - the courses at your at your school or um
41:04 - don't offer unity as an example then
41:06 - like okay you know that unity is is is
41:09 - is um is important uh for for uh game
41:12 - development then you know do that on
41:14 - your spare time um there are there are a
41:17 - lot of resources right now where uh that
41:19 - where you can you can actively learn
41:22 - you know me growing up i didn't have any
41:24 - of that so i pretty much had to learn on
41:26 - the job um but now i'm just i'm just
41:28 - amazed at the amount of information and
41:31 - research not research um um
41:34 - uh
41:35 - what's the word
41:37 - the
41:38 - amount of things
41:40 - advice tips advice is the content
41:43 - networking that that's out there right
41:44 - now um so that's that's something
41:47 - free content yes thank you
41:50 - thanks jolene
41:51 - um i do think that's great advice um val
41:54 - what do you think sort of practical
41:56 - getting ready for careers type uh type
41:58 - advice
42:00 - yeah i think that it's really important
42:02 - um and i i
42:04 - say this from experience you can have a
42:05 - lot of anxiety like oh my gosh is this
42:08 - the thing i'm going to do for the rest
42:09 - of my life no
42:11 - um so but find out what your you know
42:14 - what you've studied what you have
42:16 - interest in and really think about the
42:18 - companies you want to work for like do
42:20 - you want to work for a big company do
42:22 - you want to work for a small company um
42:25 - and really look at the type of companies
42:27 - and culture you want to work for
42:29 - um look at the the job descriptions that
42:32 - they have you know see what are the kind
42:34 - of roles um that you might be interested
42:38 - in so maybe it's not a right out of
42:40 - college role but hey if it's something
42:42 - with you know the the first step
42:45 - and then that'll give you a sense of
42:47 - maybe the type of classes or the type of
42:50 - um activities to do
42:52 - and i think there's a ton of value in
42:54 - building your own portfolio um so
42:57 - whether um whether that is doing
43:00 - something on the side
43:02 - for a company an internship but even if
43:05 - an internship isn't available if there's
43:08 - something that you have a point of view
43:10 - a prototype or an interest
43:12 - um build it make it include that in your
43:15 - portfolio use that in your you know in
43:17 - your interview when you have that um
43:21 - it's
43:22 - again i just ca like it
43:24 - as deanna said there's so many tools out
43:27 - there that you can empower yourself and
43:29 - your creativity with and i think it's
43:32 - also being yourself too is really
43:34 - important so whether it's building your
43:36 - portfolio your resume
43:39 - and then the last thing i'd like to add
43:40 - to the group here is really network i
43:43 - mean again linkedin free tool out there
43:47 - find find people who um who might
43:50 - inspire you i mean a lot of people are
43:52 - happy to um talk with people coming out
43:56 - of university you know who have an
43:59 - interest
44:00 - they may not have a job for you off the
44:02 - spot like when you reach out to them but
44:04 - they may have advice or they may be able
44:06 - to connect you with someone or they may
44:07 - have a friend and so

44:11 - network you know just start building it

45:23 - share your resources with this community
45:25 - and people will share back with you
45:27 - i want to take a couple of the really
45:28 - great questions people have asked um
45:30 - this one is well we've gotten this in a
45:33 - couple of ways it's sort of a question
45:34 - that caitlyn asked somebody else asked
45:36 - it in the q a
45:37 - um it's about balancing work and life
45:39 - and specifically around personal
45:42 - projects and interests and maybe growing
45:44 - those things and you're nine to five
45:46 - where you know you get a paycheck and
45:48 - health insurance i hope um so val why
45:51 - don't you start with this how do you
45:52 - think about that balance
45:54 - so i mean i will say it it is a
45:57 - challenge i mean it is it is a challenge
46:00 - um you know if you're working and i
46:02 - think particularly when you're working
46:03 - in something you enjoy
46:05 - um and again it's me personally i've had
46:08 - challenges with this because when i'm
46:10 - enjoying my work and i'm i'm
46:13 - solving a particular problem working
46:14 - through a creative idea um i get
46:17 - immersed in i want to keep going um for
46:19 - me running is really important
46:22 - and just general
46:24 - fitness so the volleyball is okay
46:29 - but you know fitness is important uh
46:31 - spending time with my family is
46:32 - important and so
46:34 - a good gauge is like if i'm not running
46:36 - as much as i was or
46:38 - um if i'm not doing the regular
46:41 - activities then i know i need to check
46:43 - myself you know i know like okay
46:47 - i have this this stint where it's gonna
46:49 - be intense like whether we have a big
46:51 - big launch or something coming up but
46:53 - then after that and i try and manage
46:56 - that with my family as well like look we
46:57 - have this big event this launch and then
46:59 - after that you know we need to work i
47:01 - always say like get back to regular so
47:03 - that is you know running that is
47:05 - spending the time
47:06 - but i mean when you do what you love it
47:08 - can be a challenge
47:11 - i love naming that and finding what your
47:13 - regular is and that's going to look
47:14 - different for everybody is so important
47:17 - how about you diana
47:19 - well for me um i i have uh in the last
47:22 - couple of months have been very
47:25 - uh
47:26 - very transparent about uh my burnout
47:30 - um because i i experienced burnout um i
47:33 - worked you know i i worked in in game
47:35 - development obviously and so game
47:37 - development was uh it has uh has it you
47:41 - know depending on the studio a terrible
47:43 - work-life balance to be frank that's
47:44 - just you know that's how it is but thank
47:46 - goodness things are changing and i think
47:48 - what val said earlier about when you're
47:50 - looking at at companies and you're
47:52 - looking at you know um uh you know where
47:55 - you want to work it's important that you
47:57 - know the companies that you work at uh
47:59 - provide that that important uh work-life
48:02 - balance um otherwise you become burnt
48:04 - out like i did um and so uh and so for
48:07 - me um
48:09 - because i think
48:10 - uh one of the things that we need to we
48:12 - need to you know as women we need to
48:14 - constantly remind ourselves is that like
48:16 - we have because we have to work a lot
48:17 - harder you have to work harder um we
48:19 - have to pr we have to prove
48:22 - ourselves um a lot more and so you know
48:25 - i found myself just working
48:27 - uh too many hours um i found myself
48:29 - putting a lot of pressure on myself um i
48:32 - thought i found myself taking taking
48:34 - work that didn't um
48:36 - uh taking work that you know frankly
48:38 - wasn't my job and uh because but because
48:41 - you know i
48:42 - was not um because i wasn't uh
48:46 - you know feeling like i was you know
48:48 - being treated equally um i felt like i
48:50 - needed to work extra and that
48:52 - significantly burnt me out um
48:55 - and i crashed and i needed um and i
48:58 - needed to take a break and so uh what i
49:01 - so i i would be lying to you
49:04 - i would be lying to you if i said oh
49:07 - yeah you know i just you know go
49:10 - i i go running because i i literally
49:13 - could not get up
49:15 - like get get off my couch because that's
49:16 - how tired i was uh my brain was you
49:19 - could just could not um put that
49:20 - together and i'm giving you all this
49:22 - information because i i think it's
49:24 - important that we we talk about the
49:27 - about burnout um in this industry um and
49:30 - we also talked that we were also honest
49:32 - with ourselves um and it yes you're so
49:35 - right caitlyn it takes
49:37 - such a long time to recover from i'm
49:39 - just
49:40 - recovering from it um i when you asked
49:42 - me emily what book i was reading um
49:45 - earlier
49:46 - i
49:47 - didn't pick up a book for about five
49:50 - years and because i just could not i
49:52 - could not put i could not read so i just
49:55 - read i just finished reading a book a
49:57 - couple months ago and now i'm back in my
49:58 - comics and all this other all this other
50:00 - uh really really great things um
50:04 - but uh what i've started to do is punch
50:07 - out so i punch out at a specific time
50:11 - um every day
50:12 - and i say i'm done and then you know i i
50:15 - have a laptop for work and then i have
50:17 - my own pc and i shut down my laptop and
50:20 - then i hop on and i you know play final
50:22 - fantasy or i or i you know go and play
50:25 - something else or i i get up um and i go
50:28 - for a walk i i have my i have my dogs
50:32 - that i love very much and i go take them
50:33 - out for a walk i started gardening um so
50:37 - i find like i find like it's necessary
50:39 - that we need to have
50:40 - uh that that it's important that we
50:43 - advocate for ourselves for that
50:45 - work-life balance
50:47 - um value you're not in your head i feel
50:49 - like you need to say something go
50:50 -  like
50:52 - i'm like oh i'm like whoa amen yes
50:55 - because
50:56 - because i've definitely
50:59 - been there in a couple of stents
51:01 - throughout my career um i've definitely
51:04 - been there one actually
51:06 - one time happened my son was really
51:08 - young and
51:10 - he i was working a ton of hours i was
51:12 - traveling a lot um
51:14 - and he just happened to be jumping on
51:16 - the bed and
51:18 - he actually gave me a concussion
51:20 - like by the kid's got a hard head but uh
51:23 - he actually gave me a concussion and
51:25 - knocked me out for about six weeks like
51:27 - where i was not not
51:29 - but i was conscious but it but it i had
51:30 - to take work off for six weeks and the
51:33 - doctor told me he's like you're going to
51:35 - have to put your type 8 personality on
51:37 - the back burner so i like this like i'm
51:39 - like i'm like a b now like like
51:42 - and then
51:44 - but i i got to that point and then um
51:46 - and then sure enough it creeped back up
51:49 - again i was in a very um executive role
51:52 - i was the only woman who had ever been
51:54 - in that kind of role uh definitely the
51:56 - only mom who had ever been in that kind
51:58 - of role so as you were talking about
52:00 - that's that responsibility or feel like
52:03 - having feeling like you're having to
52:05 - like do more
52:07 - you know to prove your worth to prove
52:09 - like i can do it too you know i
52:11 - definitely i'm like oh i'm like i've
52:14 - definitely
52:16 - been there and i think it is really
52:17 - important you know that
52:20 - hey we i think one we hold ourselves
52:23 - accountable but we also are vocal in
52:26 - that and we set those boundaries you
52:28 - know it's like
52:29 - uh
52:30 - here's you like you say you like you
52:32 - punch out and you go play final fantasy
52:34 - i mean mine's like i got my oculus in
52:36 - there but
52:38 - i need to get it
52:40 - but it is and and now kind of um that
52:44 - that's where i am now it's like i know i
52:46 - need to get i know when i need to get
52:48 - back to my regular and i am vocal um you
52:51 - know at i will say at dinsu
52:54 - uh and merkel our team our team's there
52:57 - they appreciate that and they value that
52:59 - and i also encourage everybody else to
53:02 - you know hey raise your hand if you're
53:04 - if you can't take you know if you can't
53:05 - take on something else or communicate
53:08 - hey i've got this you know this is when
53:11 - i i will um and be being vocal and being
53:14 - your own advocate i think is super
53:16 - critical
53:18 - finding a place where you feel safe
53:19 - enough to be like hey
53:21 - you know you need to find find find that
53:24 - that positive place that where you know
53:26 - that you can you know you can go to your
53:28 - teammates and you can go
53:30 - hey
53:31 - um i don't feel very good i woke up with
53:32 - a headache or hey um i have i have
53:35 - cramps today i and if they're killing me
53:37 - so i'm gonna go take a nap and so
53:39 - they'll be like yeah sure go for it so
53:41 - that's that's the sort of positive
53:43 - environment um that uh that we we need
53:46 - to we need to bring which i think
53:49 - comes with those soft skills it does
53:51 - come with the soft skills and it also
53:52 - comes i think with more diverse people
53:54 - working in these spaces and being able
53:56 - to share themselves and i'm going to end
53:58 - this on a positive note because it got a
54:00 - little heavy and i i say that in a good
54:02 - way like sharing some of the
54:03 - vulnerabilities and the coping and also
54:05 - the times when the coping doesn't really
54:07 - work that happens sometimes so i want to
54:10 - end on um a very fun question this is
54:12 - from vanessa
54:13 - she asked what's a moment from a video
54:15 - game that has always stuck with you and
54:17 - that's going to be our last little quick
54:19 - question for the group and then just for
54:21 - the audience we're going to share some
54:22 - upcoming girls who code events and
54:24 - programs
54:26 - and then we're going to rap because we
54:27 - respect all of y'all's time and it's uh
54:29 - it's a late evening so a video game
54:32 - moment that has always stuck with you
54:34 - whoever's got one drop it
54:36 - i've got one okay i'm gonna take it all
54:39 - the way back to pac-man like when they
54:41 - go in the middle you know and they kiss
54:43 - like i love that
54:46 - um mine is mine is a uh is it mmo final
54:50 - fantasy
54:51 - uh so there were two final fantasy 14s
54:54 - there was the first one and then they
54:56 - relaunched it again because the first
54:58 - one was not as successful but the really
55:00 - neat thing that they did was they
55:02 - in the first one they
55:04 - made it so that like for like a couple
55:06 - of months there was like this like
55:08 - meteor that was just like over here
55:10 - somewhere
55:11 - and then it got closer and closer and
55:13 - closer and it would be like the
55:15 - impending end of the world and so
55:17 - everybody and so like everybody signed
55:19 - on and we sat there as this like meteor
55:22 - came
55:22 - and it's nothing and it came and like
55:25 - destroyed the world and then a
55:27 - a cut scene showed up that was like
55:29 - amazing and then it started it started
55:32 - the next one that was one of the best
