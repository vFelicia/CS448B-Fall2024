00:25 - classes then you can look online there
00:28 - are also after school and summer
00:29 - programs with girls who code and other
00:31 - organizations that are often free and

00:36 - never heard of coding or you find it too
00:38 - difficult it doesn't hurt to try there
00:40 - are so many YouTube tutorials related to
