00:37 - screenshot at the google form that i
00:39 - have below so again to be entered to win
00:42 - this gpu sign up for the nvidia gtc this
00:45 - is the global technology conference i
00:47 - will leave that link in the description
00:49 - and then submit a google form and have a
00:51 - screenshot of you attending at least one
00:53 - of the nvidia gtc events if you do that
00:56 - then you will be eligible and sometime
00:58 - after this has completed i will randomly
01:00 - select the winner from the form and then
01:02 - send the gpu to you wherever you are in
01:05 - the world completely for free now just
01:07 - to tell you a little bit more about the
01:09 - gtc as i've said it's the global
01:11 - technology conference it's one of the
01:12 - largest ai conferences in the world and
01:15 - they're going to have over 900 sessions
01:17 - from over 1400 different speakers now
01:20 - this gtc is going to be covering a wide
01:22 - variety of topics however some of the
01:24 - things that may be interesting to you
01:25 - include deep learning artificial
01:27 - intelligence natural language processing
01:30 - data science quantum computing and
01:32 - really anything you can imagine in the
01:34 - high-end computing graphics and ai world
01:37 - will be covered in this conference now
01:39 - with that said let me give you a quick
01:40 - demo of some cool technology that nvidia
01:43 - has been working on that you can
01:44 - actually use today so in front of me i
01:46 - have the website for nvidia riva or riva
01:49 - not exactly sure how you pronounce that
01:51 - but this is a gpu accelerated sdk for
01:54 - building speech ai applications that are
01:56 - customized for your use case and deliver
01:58 - real-time performance now you can use
02:00 - this right now so i'll leave this link
02:02 - in the description in case you want to
02:03 - check it out there's also a demo that
02:05 - i'm going to run through in one second
02:07 - what this package allows you to do or
02:08 - what this sdk allows you to do is
02:10 - automatic speech recognition as well as
02:13 - text to speech so you can talk into the
02:15 - microphone it's automatically gonna
02:17 - recognize pretty much all of the words
02:18 - that you're saying as well as the
02:20 - punctuations like question marks
02:22 - exclamation points commas periods etc
02:25 - which is really cool and something i
02:26 - haven't typically seen in automatic
02:28 - speech recognition and then
02:29 - alternatively you can do text to speech
02:31 - so you can have kind of the ai voice
02:33 - actually read out whatever it is that
02:34 - you want now one of the really cool
02:36 - things about this sdk is that it's fully
02:38 - customizable and you can go in and tweak
02:40 - the model you can add your own training
02:42 - data and you can make it so it
02:44 - understands maybe specific jargon or
02:46 - terms that aren't in the dictionary or
02:48 - stuff that's specific for your
02:49 - application or use case anyways i'll let
02:52 - you guys check this out from the link in
02:53 - the description but for now let's just
02:55 - go through the demo here and i'll show
02:56 - you how this works so i've just started
02:58 - the demo here and you can see how it's
03:00 - doing on the right hand side of my
03:02 - screen
03:03 - now one of the cool things here is that
03:04 - we actually get punctuation
03:07 - so as you can see if i stop for long
03:09 - enough it will add the period and then
03:11 - if i were to ask a question like how's
03:12 - your day going
03:14 - you should see that we get the question
03:16 - so that's one of the impressive things
03:18 - with this sdk right here is that
03:20 - actually gives you the correct grammar
03:21 - and punctuation which is something i
03:23 - haven't really seen in any of the other
03:25 - automatic speech recognition programs or
03:27 - sdks whatever you want to call anyways
03:30 - this is done pretty well now if i just
03:31 - read some of the sentences now comma one
03:33 - of the cool things here is that we
03:35 - actually get punctuation so as you can
03:37 - see comma if i stop for long enough it
03:38 - will add the period and if i were to ask
03:40 - a question like how's your day going it
03:42 - adds the question so pretty good again
03:44 - you guys can check this out from for
03:46 - yourself i'll leave it in the
03:47 - description there's also some videos
03:48 - here of the domain specific automatic
03:50 - speech recognition that's why i was
03:52 - talking about how you can tweak the
03:53 - model add in your own jargon and terms
03:56 - and then the controllable text to speech
03:58 - so going in the other direction giving
03:59 - the computer some text and then having
04:01 - it read that out in a way that doesn't
04:03 - sound as robotic as your traditional
04:05 - kind of robot voice alright so that's
04:07 - pretty much all i want to show you for
04:09 - this demo but i will mention that if
04:11 - you're interested in natural language
04:13 - processing conversational ai which is
04:16 - kind of a field that nvidia is leading
04:17 - the way in right now then you may be
04:19 - interested in checking out the following
04:21 - sessions from the gtc so i just picked a
04:24 - few ones here that looked interesting
04:25 - that are in the conversational ai field
04:27 - or natural language processing so here's
04:30 - one this is on march 22nd conversational
04:32 - ai demystified you can read the
04:34 - description if you want another one here
04:36 - that was cool is expressive neural text
04:38 - to speech so if you want to learn about
04:40 - how that works uh continuing we have
04:42 - this one building large scale localized
04:45 - language models from data preparation to
04:47 - training and deployment to production
04:49 - another one you may be interested in and
04:51 - then lastly i have a list of all of the
04:53 - topics related to conversational ai and
04:55 - nlp so i'll kind of scroll through them
04:57 - here and you can pause the video if you
04:58 - want to read
04:59 - any that pop out to me uh looking at
05:02 - maybe automatic narrative generation
05:04 - with earth science transformer so you
05:06 - can see there's really specific stuff
05:07 - here kind of something for everyone
05:09 - here's one actually using riva or riva
05:11 - other thing that we were just checking
05:13 - out uh bring endangered taiwanese native
05:16 - languages back to life with the help of
05:17 - modern gpus like how cool is that that
05:19 - sounds pretty interesting so as you can
05:21 - see here there's all kinds of different
05:22 - sessions that you can check out the ones
05:24 - i showed you are just in the
05:25 - conversational ai because i just showed
05:27 - you that demo however there's sessions
05:29 - in all kinds of different fields and the
05:31 - categories that i mentioned at the
05:33 - beginning of the video now this was not
05:35 - enticing enough then remember that if
05:37 - you do actually attend one of those
05:38 - sessions and submit a screenshot you
05:41 - will be entered to win an rtx 3080 ti i
05:44 - cannot underestimate how powerful and
05:46 - crazy this gpu is so i'm sure a lot of
05:49 - you will be interested in winning that
05:50 - so with that said i will wrap up the
05:52 - video here thank you to nvidia for
05:54 - teaming up with me for this video and
05:56 - facilitating this giveaway good luck to
05:58 - all of you that are entering to win the
06:00 - gpu and i hope to see you in another
06:02 - youtube video
06:04 - [Music]
06:11 - you
