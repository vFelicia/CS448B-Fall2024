00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back to the
00:01 - YouTube video so in today's video what
00:04 - I'm gonna be doing is showing you 11
00:05 - Python projects slash games that I've
00:08 - created over the many years that I've
00:10 - been using Python now all of these games
00:12 - are made with a module called PI game
00:14 - this allows you to make 2d games in
00:16 - Python is actually really powerful now
00:18 - the point of this video is going to be
00:20 - to give you some inspiration and
00:21 - motivation for things that you can work
00:23 - on in Python and show you the powers of
00:25 - Python when it comes to making simple 2d
00:27 - graphical user interfaces and little
00:29 - games and projects like I'm going to
00:31 - show you here so the last thing I'll say
00:33 - before we get started is right now
00:34 - there's actually new tech with Tim merch
00:36 - out I just released it it looks
00:38 - something like this this is one of the
00:40 - designs that I have and if you're on the
00:42 - computer you can actually go right
00:43 - beneath the YouTube video and you can
00:45 - see all of the different designs that
00:46 - are available if you're on your phone or
00:48 - something there's a link in the
00:49 - description but if you would like to
00:50 - purchase this it definitely does help me
00:52 - out and I can say first hand these are
00:54 - very comfortable hoodies and I think
00:55 - these designs look really awesome so
00:57 - anyways with that being said let's go
00:58 - ahead and get started and look at eleven
01:00 - Python project slash games so the first
01:10 - game I have to show you here is actually
01:12 - my version of a guard I oh so you can
01:15 - see immediately this is actually an
01:16 - online game this is made completely with
01:18 - Python and PI game and the objective is
01:21 - to collect as much mass as possible
01:23 - without being eaten by another person so
01:25 - their 5 minute rounds and essentially
01:27 - the way it works is the biggest person
01:29 - or the biggest blob out all the blobs
01:31 - that are here at the end of the game is
01:33 - the winner so what I actually did is I
01:35 - created this game because I worked as a
01:36 - STEM program coordinator at a summer
01:39 - camp and my kind of role there was to
01:41 - actually teach kids coding and kind of
01:42 - take on the technology side of the camp
01:44 - so I wanted to make a game that all the
01:46 - kids can be able to play and have fun
01:47 - with and actually be able to see that
01:49 - hey I made this this is something they
01:51 - could potentially make if they wanted to
01:53 - continue on with coding and keep
01:54 - learning so anyways I'll play a few
01:56 - clips of them playing this game but yes
01:58 - this is a fully online game it works on
01:59 - your local area network so you do have
02:01 - to be on the same Wi-Fi network to
02:03 - actually play against each other so this
02:05 - next game I have to show you guys is
02:07 - called super mini golf now this is based
02:09 - off of one of my favorite games that I
02:11 - played as a kid on the App Store
02:13 - called super stickman mini-golf and you
02:15 - can see that essentially the idea behind
02:17 - this game is you are a golf ball and you
02:19 - can shoot it around and you're trying to
02:20 - get it into the hole so this works just
02:22 - like regular golf in terms of the
02:24 - scoring system if you hit a water hazard
02:25 - you get +1 strokes there's some
02:28 - power-ups in this top corner here so we
02:30 - have Power Shot Mulligan which reverses
02:32 - your previous shot and then sticky ball
02:34 - so I'm gonna go ahead and try with the
02:36 - Powerball here and see if I can get that
02:37 - into the hole
02:38 - now I'm inputting mode and I can putt in
02:41 - so you can see it tells us what our
02:43 - score is brings up a scoreboard and that
02:45 - is pretty much it for this game I mean
02:47 - there's a bunch of other levels I'm not
02:48 - gonna play through all of them but we'll
02:50 - get into the rest of the games after a
02:52 - quick word from our sponsor I need to
02:54 - thank simply learned for sponsoring this
02:55 - video and introduce you all to their
02:57 - data scientist master program that was
02:59 - co-developed with IBM this program is
03:02 - comprised of six unique courses that
03:04 - implement a unique blended learning
03:05 - experience in a high engagement online
03:07 - classroom environment during this
03:09 - program you will master 30-plus
03:11 - in-demand skills and work with tools and
03:13 - languages like our SAS Python tableau
03:15 - Hadoop and spark you'll master these
03:18 - skills through 15 real-life projects and
03:20 - one capstone project during this
03:22 - 12-month comprehensive course you'll
03:25 - also be given 1200 USD worth of IBM
03:28 - cloud credits to use during your 24/7
03:30 - access to the IBM watson platform after
03:33 - completion of this course you'll be
03:34 - given certificates from IBM and simply
03:36 - learned to testify to your skills as an
03:38 - expert in data science get started by
03:40 - hitting the link in the description so
03:42 - the next game I have for us is a classic
03:44 - this actually is probably the first PI
03:46 - game project I ever worked on you can
03:48 - see a nice lovely green background I
03:50 - don't know what I was thinking with that
03:51 - but you get the point here just hangman
03:54 - you can guess different letters I'm sure
03:56 - you all know kind of how this works
03:57 - let's see if we can actually get this
03:59 - word and then we'll move on to the next
04:00 - project d f no G's is not going well yes
04:04 - okay does anyone know what this word is
04:07 - because I do not
04:09 - maybe I'm just really bad at hangman M
04:10 - no it looks like we lost the phrase was
04:13 - ooh ologist okay I don't know how I was
04:15 - gonna guess that but anyways you get it
04:16 - hangman generates a different word every
04:18 - time and a pretty cool project
04:20 - especially for beginners looking to
04:21 - learn kind of how to use this module so
04:23 - this next project is less of a game
04:25 - more of just an illustration of
04:27 - something you can do with pygame so you
04:29 - can see that what this actually is is a
04:30 - genetic algorithm that learns how to
04:32 - play flappy bird so i generate a bunch
04:35 - of birds at the start and the idea is
04:36 - the best birds survive each next round
04:39 - and they slowly learn how to actually
04:40 - play this game so I don't know if we'll
04:42 - have enough times for you to see a very
04:44 - successful bird that just can go through
04:45 - and do this infinitely but the point is
04:47 - that I made this in PI games so this
04:49 - whole flappy bird thing I just copy the
04:51 - original flappy bird design and made
04:53 - that and then even implemented all of
04:55 - the birds and the AI and yeah it's
04:57 - something cool something fun and shows
04:59 - you that if you want to do some kind of
05:00 - AI stuffs like reinforcement learning or
05:02 - genetic algorithms and you want to
05:04 - visualize that a really cool way an easy
05:06 - way to do that is using the module like
05:08 - Pi game and it seems like this guy's
05:10 - actually doing fairly well and I'm
05:11 - pretty confident to say that he will
05:13 - probably make it through all of the
05:14 - tubes and actually never die in this
05:16 - game so the next game I have for you
05:18 - guys is actually online chess now I made
05:20 - this during an 18 hour livestream on
05:23 - YouTube yes I did livestream for 18
05:25 - hours straight and there's actually a
05:27 - really cool game so I made some
05:28 - modifications to it here but you can see
05:30 - that one of these guys is white you can
05:32 - move his pieces and then it moves on the
05:33 - other screen and actually shows them
05:35 - where moved so this is fully functioning
05:36 - chess um this works just like any other
05:38 - chess game would and while it is a
05:40 - little bit laggy because you know I'm
05:42 - not a network specialist in terms of
05:44 - sending packets and data and all of that
05:45 - but hopefully you get the point that
05:47 - this is just a cool online chess game
05:49 - and if you want to make something like
05:50 - this in Python you absolutely can it
05:53 - just is kind of difficult to do so
05:55 - anyways that's it for this you got the
05:56 - point there's timers going at the top
05:58 - although it doesn't even really look
05:59 - like they're working to be honest so
06:00 - maybe I broke something and yeah you can
06:03 - just play chess against someone else so
06:05 - this next one is a much more simple
06:07 - online game this is online
06:09 - rock-paper-scissors I actually have a
06:10 - full youtube tutorial that teaches how
06:12 - to do this but you get the point
06:14 - essentially you pick something the
06:16 - opponents locked in the other person
06:17 - picks something and then tells you if
06:19 - you won or lost and you continue to play
06:21 - now I believe in the finished version of
06:23 - this I actually implemented scores and
06:25 - some more fancy stuff and made it like
06:26 - centered and look a little bit nicer
06:28 - this is the version I had on my computer
06:30 - so I just figured I would show it to you
06:31 - if you want to make an online game in
06:33 - Python it's actually not that hard to do
06:35 - and starting with something like this is
06:36 - really cool it teaches you how to use
06:38 - sockets how to use
06:39 - a little bit of networking features and
06:41 - stuff and yeah it's just an interesting
06:43 - game and something that I wanted to show
06:44 - to you guys all right so the next
06:45 - program I have to show you here is
06:47 - actually my version of Microsoft Paint
06:49 - you can see that we can paint around
06:51 - here and we can make whatever we want we
06:53 - can actually save files so I can go
06:55 - ahead and save and just make this say
06:57 - like test and go save and now if I
07:01 - wanted to like say I modify all this and
07:03 - I don't save it and I go open I can open
07:05 - test and it will bring me back to what I
07:07 - was at so I actually made you know kind
07:09 - some kind of protocol to actually save
07:11 - these different files let's see if I can
07:14 - actually fill some stuff in here so this
07:15 - might not work very well but let's see
07:18 - what happens yeah so it fills everything
07:19 - except those two shapes so our sorry is
07:22 - the replace tool so I believe it
07:24 - replaces whatever color I click on with
07:26 - the other color so let's go back to our
07:28 - there there's clear that clears the
07:30 - entire screen fill this will fill one
07:33 - color so you can see that will fill the
07:34 - entire screen and yeah what these are
07:37 - the features of this game or this
07:38 - project or whatever you want to call it
07:40 - and I think that it is pretty cool so
07:41 - the next game I have to show you all is
07:43 - actually my version of snake now I'm
07:45 - really bad at snake and this version is
07:47 - not that easy to play but you can see
07:49 - this is just really a simple game of
07:51 - snake that you can make in python with
07:53 - PI game again I have a full tutorial
07:55 - series that teaches how to do this not
07:57 - very difficult by any means but is
07:59 - definitely a cool game and something
08:00 - that's kind of fun to play around with
08:01 - and show different people so the next
08:03 - game i have here i believe is pronounced
08:05 - oku i don't know if that's actually how
08:07 - you say it and I usually get roasted on
08:09 - my pronunciation for it but here's the
08:11 - game you can see it is just a simple
08:13 - version it generates a board here and
08:15 - you can actually just play the game so I
08:17 - can actually pencil in stuff by just
08:19 - only hitting it once on the square and
08:21 - then once you've put something in one of
08:23 - the squares you can press delete if you
08:25 - want to remove it or you can press ENTER
08:27 - to try to make it finalized now of
08:29 - course if it's not in the right place it
08:31 - will give you a little X at the bottom
08:32 - of the screen saying you got it wrong
08:33 - and let's say you know you've played the
08:35 - game you're really frustrated and you
08:37 - just want it to solve for you you don't
08:38 - want to have to play anymore what you
08:40 - can do is simply press space and this
08:42 - algorithm will actually automatically
08:43 - solve the board for you this uses a
08:45 - pretty popular backtracking algorithm
08:47 - and of course it's not gonna be
08:49 - responding right when I'm filming the
08:50 - video but you get the point
08:51 - let's give it one second
08:53 - we should see it actually does complete
08:55 - the board and I don't think it made any
08:57 - mistakes I know you guys can have a look
08:59 - at this and let me know I made this a
09:00 - long time ago the next game I have here
09:02 - is Tetris this is a classic game I'm
09:04 - sure I don't need to explain this to any
09:05 - of you this is actually not that
09:07 - difficult to make again I have a video
09:08 - tutorial series going through how to
09:10 - actually create Tetris but this is a fun
09:13 - game and it just really is the classic
09:15 - Tetris there's not much more to say the
09:17 - only things I didn't add from original
09:19 - Tetris was the hard drop and the shadow
09:21 - it wouldn't be that difficult to do I
09:23 - could add that if I wanted to but just
09:25 - for the video tutorial series I didn't
09:26 - end up putting that in you can see the
09:28 - next shape popping up on the other hand
09:30 - of the screen there which is a nice
09:32 - feature and then of course if you get to
09:34 - the top you will lose and we're not
09:35 - gonna have enough time to show you that
09:37 - feature so anyways that is Tetris let's
09:38 - move on to the next game now alright so
09:40 - the last game I have to show you is
09:41 - actually a tower defense game I made
09:44 - this during a 12 hour livestream on
09:46 - YouTube and I'm sure many of you have
09:47 - seen this before the idea is that you
09:49 - have all of these different towers that
09:51 - have different properties so they might
09:52 - have a different range or a different
09:54 - damage that they do you can upgrade
09:55 - these towers using stars that you
09:57 - collect from killing enemies from the
09:59 - waves you can see here I've just fast
10:01 - forwarded to wave six just to show you
10:02 - guys a more interesting stage of the
10:04 - game rather than the very beginning but
10:06 - over on the right-hand bar here you can
10:07 - buy all of the towers there is different
10:10 - towers that do different things and of
10:11 - course cost different amounts of money
10:13 - and then there is some music that I will
10:14 - play but that I doubt you will actually
10:16 - be able to hear so anyways we'll let
10:19 - this music play I'm gonna play around
10:21 - and that is pretty much it for this
10:23 - video I mean this tower defense game
10:25 - took me a lot of time to make twelve
10:29 - hours in in the livestream was not easy
10:31 - there's a lot of glitches with it but
10:33 - it's really cool and it shows you what
10:34 - you can do with Python so anyways that
10:37 - has been it for this video if you guys
10:39 - enjoyed please do make sure you leave a
10:40 - like subscribe to the channel and I will
10:42 - see you in another YouTube video
