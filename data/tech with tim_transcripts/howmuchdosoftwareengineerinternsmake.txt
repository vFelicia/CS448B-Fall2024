00:08 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:10 - youtube video
00:11 - so in today's video i'm going to be
00:13 - talking to you about how much
00:14 - software engineering interns make now
00:17 - i'm not just going to be looking at
00:18 - websites and taking all the information
00:20 - that you guys can look up yourself
00:21 - i'm actually going to walk you through
00:23 - some of the job offers that i've been
00:25 - given
00:25 - for a software engineering intern
00:27 - position and talk about the difference
00:29 - in compensation
00:30 - between u.s tech companies and canadian
00:32 - tech companies
00:33 - now not to spoil anything but as you
00:35 - guys know if you work in the us
00:37 - you get paid a lot more than if you work
00:39 - in pretty much any other country for
00:41 - software engineering and i was pretty
00:43 - surprised
00:44 - at how much less i actually was offered
00:47 - for an internship position in canada
00:49 - than i was in the us even for the exact
00:52 - same company so in this video i'm
00:53 - actually going to share with you some
00:54 - real figures i'm going to tell you
00:56 - exactly what i was paid when i worked at
00:57 - microsoft
00:58 - what i was offered from shopify and what
01:00 - i was offered for my second internship
01:02 - for microsoft which i actually
01:04 - declined and then i'll talk to you about
01:06 - things like signing bonus
01:07 - relocation and then just some other kind
01:09 - of salary figures that i know
01:11 - for people that work in the space and
01:13 - that have worked as software engineering
01:15 - interns
01:15 - at other large companies like say tesla
01:18 - google
01:19 - facebook amazon so on and so forth but
01:22 - with that said if you guys want to
01:23 - potentially get an internship at one of
01:25 - these companies then you need to check

02:08 - and now an official instructor on the
02:10 - platform get started using algo expert
02:12 - today by clicking the link in the
02:14 - description
02:15 - and using the code tech with tim for a
02:16 - discount on the platform
02:18 - so i'm just going to start by stating
02:20 - that i totally know that these numbers
02:22 - are extremely inflated and very high
02:24 - that i'm about to show to you
02:25 - the reason for that is i'm kind of
02:27 - taking this information from very large
02:29 - big tech companies of course if you're
02:31 - working for smaller tech companies
02:33 - maybe not as say name brand tech company
02:35 - startup stuff like that
02:36 - your compensation is going to be
02:38 - drastically less than what i'm putting
02:40 - here
02:40 - that doesn't mean that's a bad job
02:41 - doesn't mean you shouldn't take it and
02:43 - of course
02:43 - these jobs that i'm talking about are
02:45 - very difficult to get and there's
02:47 - hundreds of thousands of students and
02:48 - just other people that want to work in
02:50 - these internship positions
02:52 - so it is somewhat justified that you get
02:53 - paid that much uh but anyways i just
02:55 - want to say i'm totally aware this is
02:57 - not the average salary for a software
02:59 - engineering intern
03:00 - this is more referencing big tech
03:02 - companies kind of the facebook's
03:03 - amazon's microsoft's of the world so
03:05 - anyways let me just share with you some
03:07 - base salaries for different tech
03:09 - positions at least ones that i was
03:11 - offered and that i worked in
03:12 - so i'll start with the internship that i
03:14 - actually did this was at microsoft i
03:16 - started in may of 2020 finished in i
03:19 - guess
03:19 - august of 2020 and i worked there for 12
03:22 - weeks
03:23 - so i had three months working at
03:24 - microsoft and the base salary that they
03:27 - offered me
03:27 - in u.s dollars was 7 850
03:31 - us dollars per month so for me in canada
03:34 - that is a
03:34 - ton of money i mean even in u.s dollars
03:36 - that's a ton of money anyways but that
03:38 - was about 10
03:39 - 900 canadian dollars at the time due to
03:42 - the exchange rate being something like
03:44 - 1.27
03:45 - from us dollar to canadian dollar now
03:48 - the reason why i was paid in us dollars
03:50 - was because my job position was actually
03:53 - in
03:54 - redmond washington at microsoft home
03:56 - base so that's like where the offer was
03:58 - for
03:58 - and i had actually flown to redmond
04:00 - washington done the on-site interviews
04:03 - in kind of early january of 2020 then
04:06 - obviously the pandemic happened and then
04:07 - we moved to work from home
04:09 - however since i had signed a u.s job
04:11 - offer they had to pay me the same
04:13 - compensation
04:14 - that i had signed and so i was paid out
04:16 - in canadian dollars from the microsoft
04:18 - canada office
04:19 - but what the us compensation was that
04:21 - they offered me so hopefully that makes
04:22 - sense
04:23 - but that's kind of the reason why i was
04:24 - getting a u.s rate even though i was
04:26 - working and living in canada it was
04:28 - because
04:28 - before the pandemic happened i had
04:30 - signed the job offer to work in the u.s
04:33 - and then they couldn't allow me to
04:34 - actually go to the us because of the
04:36 - pandemic and so they kept the same
04:37 - compensation everything but just
04:39 - switched the currency to canadian
04:40 - dollars
04:41 - and did the appropriate conversion now
04:43 - some other base salaries
04:44 - that i've been offered so first of all i
04:46 - got a return offer from microsoft that i
04:49 - actually declined i'm not going to be
04:50 - working at microsoft
04:51 - this year for an internship again the
04:54 - reason why they gave me another
04:55 - internship is because i was too young to
04:57 - have a full-time position
04:58 - right now i'm technically in my third
05:00 - year of university just finishing that
05:02 - um and so they had to give me another
05:04 - internship anyways the salary for that
05:06 - internship was the exact same
05:08 - 7850 us dollars per month
05:11 - and then they actually offered me a 5
05:13 - 000 us dollar
05:14 - signing bonus for returning as an intern
05:17 - one more time
05:18 - now when they sent me that offer so the
05:19 - second kind of return offer
05:21 - the assumption was i would actually be
05:22 - working in seattle washington or i'd be
05:24 - working in redmond washington i always
05:26 - mix up seattle and redmond they're kind
05:28 - of right beside each other
05:29 - in washington state anyways uh that's
05:32 - what they offered me so they offered me
05:33 - 7850
05:34 - plus 5 000 signing bonus and then what
05:37 - happened
05:38 - is they realized that i wasn't actually
05:39 - going to be able to go to redmond again
05:42 - because of the pandemic
05:43 - and so what they did is they retracted
05:45 - that offer from me and then they gave me
05:47 - another offer based on the location i
05:49 - was going to be working in
05:50 - which was kind of the toronto area in
05:52 - canada now this second offer that they
05:54 - gave to me was
05:55 - drastically different than the first
05:56 - actually have it in front of me right
05:57 - now i'm looking at it to make sure i
05:58 - don't get this wrong
06:00 - and the compensation then that they
06:01 - offered me for the kind of canadian
06:03 - position
06:04 - was only 5 300 canadian per month
06:07 - so i'm not saying only as if that's not
06:09 - a lot of money but relative to what they
06:11 - had offered me before
06:12 - that's about half so previously it was
06:14 - like 10 900 canadian
06:16 - now it's 5300 canadian dollars and the
06:19 - reason why that compensation is so much
06:21 - lower is because cost of living
06:23 - and whatever other reasons they want to
06:24 - state but essentially because i was
06:26 - working in canada they pretty much
06:27 - sliced my uh compensation in half
06:29 - and then they even reduced the signing
06:31 - bonus to 3 500
06:33 - canadian dollars so that kind of gives
06:35 - you the idea
06:36 - of the difference between working in
06:38 - canada versus working in the us
06:40 - even just at an intern level and of
06:41 - course there's a lot more stuff that
06:42 - happens when you're going to be a
06:43 - full-time employee
06:44 - but that is kind of the base salary and
06:47 - then i guess signing bonuses that i was
06:48 - offered
06:49 - now the last internship position that i
06:51 - was offered was at
06:52 - shopify in canada so this was actually
06:55 - in the ottawa office for shopify
06:57 - and i was offered 33 an hour as a
07:00 - back-end developer intern now i'd be
07:01 - working 40 hours a week
07:03 - so let me just pop up the calculator on
07:05 - my phone here and do the math so 40
07:07 - times what i say 33
07:08 - so that's 1320 dollars per week times
07:11 - four weeks so that's about 5280
07:14 - a month so that's about on track with
07:16 - what uh the microsoft canada offer
07:18 - letter was
07:20 - so that's kind of my experience with
07:22 - salaries and signing bonuses
07:24 - from tech companies at an intern level
07:26 - position
07:27 - but i'll tell you about a few of my
07:28 - friends i won't obviously name them
07:30 - they told me the salaries they were
07:31 - making so one of my friends worked at
07:33 - tesla and first of all he said that
07:35 - working at tesla was great it was a
07:37 - really good time but
07:38 - all interns were pretty much expected to
07:40 - be working 60-plus hours a week so take
07:43 - that into consideration
07:44 - when i tell you this number he said that
07:46 - during his first year working at tesla
07:48 - he was getting paid 13 000 canadian
07:50 - dollars per month
07:51 - to work there as an intern he was
07:53 - working on the back end and doing
07:55 - something with like autonomous
07:56 - vehicles i mean you know that sounds
07:58 - very generic because that's what tesla
08:00 - does
08:00 - but he was actually working on like the
08:01 - ai side of that and some server
08:03 - component or something along those lines
08:06 - i then had a few people that worked at
08:07 - google that i knew and they were making
08:09 - about 11
08:10 - 500 canadian per month uh and that's
08:13 - pretty much all that i can remember um
08:15 - there's a few other people that i knew
08:16 - that worked on
08:17 - at amazon and all of that but i don't
08:18 - think they ever shared their salaries
08:20 - with me
08:20 - so anyways that is kind of the range for
08:22 - working for large big
08:24 - tech companies now of course that is in
08:26 - the u.s like you have to work in the us
08:28 - to make that kind of money
08:29 - but obviously even coming to canada 5300
08:32 - a month for no experience and
08:34 - learning a ton and having this on your
08:36 - resume is obviously not a bad gig
08:38 - whatsoever all right so now i'm going to
08:39 - move on to the other aspects of
08:41 - compensation because
08:42 - that's not the only thing that they give
08:44 - you when you work at these large tech
08:45 - companies a lot of the times there's
08:47 - relocation
08:48 - lump sum payments um there is like
08:50 - vacation
08:51 - paid tax gross up all kinds of other
08:53 - things that actually are definitely
08:54 - worth considering
08:56 - kind of as a part of your total
08:57 - compensation for these companies
08:59 - so for microsoft specifically what they
09:02 - offered me in terms of kind of extra
09:03 - compensation was relocation
09:06 - payment or relocation lump sum so it was
09:08 - kind of two options when it was assumed
09:09 - i was actually going to be flying out to
09:11 - redmond and working
09:12 - in uh in redmond washington option one
09:15 - was
09:15 - microsoft will arrange and pay for all
09:17 - of your housing so you'll live in
09:19 - whatever their corporate housing is
09:21 - you don't really have a choice on where
09:22 - you're going to be or if you have
09:23 - roommates or any of that kind of stuff
09:24 - but they'll arrange it for you
09:26 - they'll pay for it for you so that was
09:27 - the first option the second option was
09:30 - microsoft will pay you a lump sum
09:32 - seven thousand us dollars and you
09:34 - arrange your own housing
09:36 - um when you're actually working for
09:37 - microsoft now there was another aspect
09:39 - of that there was also i'm calling that
09:41 - relocation
09:42 - uh but there was another like travel
09:44 - kind of incentive or
09:46 - travel bonus whatever you want to call
09:48 - it where they would pay for your plane
09:50 - ticket there
09:51 - and back or they would cover all of your
09:53 - expenses related to driving to your
09:55 - internship and driving back
09:57 - including a one-night hotel stay or
09:59 - something like that
10:00 - and then they also will reimburse you
10:01 - for all expenses related to travel so
10:04 - like if you ate
10:05 - meals at the airport or stuff like that
10:07 - then they would pay you back for that
10:09 - finally they also had a rental car
10:11 - option this is what i was actually going
10:13 - to do when i was going to be working at
10:14 - microsoft and i thought i was going to
10:15 - be flying out there
10:17 - they have partnerships with a bunch of
10:18 - bunch of rental car companies
10:20 - and so i think they had a rate of like
10:21 - 300 per month that they offered to
10:23 - interns to rent out some
10:25 - some vehicle now that's a lot cheaper
10:27 - than if you were to rent it just
10:28 - straight from the rental car company
10:30 - so something to consider finally as a
10:32 - part of the
10:33 - kind of remote um offer letter whatever
10:37 - you want to call it
10:37 - they also included equipment so they
10:39 - provided you i'm looking right here
10:41 - um actually it doesn't say exactly how
10:44 - much money but they
10:45 - provided you with the laptop monitor
10:47 - keyboard mouse
10:48 - docking station headset and something
10:50 - else and actually at the end of my
10:52 - first internship i did at microsoft
10:54 - since it was remote all of that stuff
10:56 - that they offered to me i got to keep
10:57 - except for the laptop so i got to keep
10:59 - the docking station
11:00 - the monitor keyboard mouse headset and
11:03 - then i had to send back the actual
11:04 - laptop
11:05 - and the laptop they sent you is like
11:06 - pretty souped up like you know a good
11:08 - nice computer so i can understand why
11:10 - they wanted it back
11:12 - other than that there's a ton of other
11:13 - just kind of like random miscellaneous
11:15 - things that they'll give you for example
11:16 - there's like a free gym membership
11:18 - there's a tax gross up a tax gross up
11:21 - means that
11:21 - since all of these kind of relocations
11:23 - things are considered taxable income
11:26 - so like if you get paid you know five
11:27 - thousand dollars from microsoft to
11:29 - relocate to redmond washington for
11:31 - example
11:31 - you have to pay tax on that amount
11:33 - microsoft will actually pay a portion of
11:35 - that tax for you to the government
11:37 - so that it offsets your kind of tax
11:39 - burden they call that a tax
11:40 - gross up other than that i'm looking
11:42 - through the kind of offer right now
11:44 - there's a four percent vacation pay
11:46 - um obviously you get all of your stat
11:48 - holidays and i think that's
11:49 - pretty much it related to compensation
11:52 - at these companies
11:54 - now i will say uh the shopify offer had
11:56 - a few things related to this as well
11:57 - obviously there wasn't any relocation
11:59 - bonuses because i was actually close
12:01 - enough that i could have walked to work
12:02 - when i
12:03 - was living in ottawa and would have been
12:05 - working at the shopify ottawa office
12:07 - but they did provide you with twelve
12:09 - hundred dollars towards like a fitness
12:11 - and and gym
12:12 - kind of budget type of thing so if you
12:14 - wanted to buy a bike or you wanted to
12:16 - get a gym membership or anything like
12:17 - that then you could use the 1200
12:19 - they provided you to do that they also
12:21 - provided um
12:23 - what is it money for remote work so one
12:25 - of my friends who worked at shopify was
12:27 - given
12:27 - i think 1200 or 1500 dollars like build
12:30 - her own home office
12:31 - buy a monitor whatever she wants and
12:33 - then they provided a laptop as well
12:35 - so anyways i think that's all i really
12:37 - need to talk about related to
12:39 - compensation as an intern at these tech
12:41 - companies it's relatively sim
12:43 - similar to a full-time position except
12:45 - you're not getting stock at least i
12:47 - don't know any interns that have gotten
12:48 - stock at these different companies
12:50 - but yeah these salaries are just crazy
12:52 - high it kind of blew my mind when i was
12:53 - actually offered that salary the first
12:55 - time
12:56 - and then even comparing it to canadian
12:57 - salaries right it just
12:59 - goes to show you that if you want to
13:00 - make the real money working in the us is
13:02 - really the place to be or at least
13:04 - working
13:05 - remotely with a us job offer so anyways
13:07 - i hope this gave you guys some insight i
13:09 - apologize if it was kind of all over the
13:10 - place
13:11 - just trying to give you all of the
13:12 - information that i have if you enjoyed
13:14 - the video make sure to leave a like
13:15 - subscribe to the channel and i will see
13:16 - you in another youtube video
