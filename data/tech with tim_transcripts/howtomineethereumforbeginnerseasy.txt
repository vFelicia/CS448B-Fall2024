00:00 - hey guys welcome back to another video
00:02 - in today's video I'm gonna be talking
00:03 - about mining and more specifically
00:05 - mining aetherium so today we're just
00:08 - gonna go through the very basics on how
00:10 - to actually start mining and I'm just
00:12 - gonna explain a little bit of what
00:13 - mining is right now before we get
00:15 - started so pretty much what mining is is
00:18 - using computational power so using
00:20 - graphics cards it's more specifically in
00:22 - your computer to secure transactions so
00:26 - whenever a transaction is sent on the
00:28 - blockchain which is how aetherium works
00:30 - it's built on the blockchain all of
00:33 - those transactions go through a bunch of
00:34 - different computers where they then
00:36 - secure that transaction and they are
00:38 - given a very small reward for doing so
00:41 - so just like a fee at a bank that's the
00:44 - same thing that you're getting on your
00:45 - computer for doing amount of work okay
00:48 - so that's really basics of how mining
00:50 - works I'm not gonna explain exactly how
00:52 - to do that if you want to see that go
00:54 - look up another video where I'll make
00:56 - another one on my channel another day
00:57 - okay so the first thing we need to do
00:59 - when we have to start mining is we have
01:01 - to make sure we have the right hardware
01:03 - so pretty much any computer will work as
01:05 - long as it has a graphics card or
01:08 - multiple graphics cards that have 4
01:11 - gigabytes or more of video RAM so for
01:14 - example the 1050 Ti has 4 gigabytes of
01:17 - video RAM so that will work the RX 480
01:19 - has 8 gigabytes of video RAM that will
01:22 - work anything that has less than that so
01:23 - if you have a three gigabyte card that
01:25 - will not work for mining ok so now that
01:29 - we've got that over with let's download
01:31 - our miners so what we're gonna actually
01:32 - have to do if we're mining and we're
01:34 - just starting out we don't have a huge
01:35 - factory yet of mining rings we're gonna
01:38 - have to mind with a pool so if you mind
01:40 - with a pool that means you're gonna get
01:41 - more and more transactions going through
01:44 - your computer and the only downfall of
01:46 - mining with a pool is that they actually
01:48 - take a 1% fee but really that's not that
01:51 - much you can see the 1% fee is here it's
01:54 - a lot faster than doing it alone so
01:56 - you're gonna want to mind with a pool ok
01:58 - so how to connect we're just gonna
01:59 - scroll down this page it's on ether mine
02:01 - org I'm gonna leave that in the
02:03 - description there's a lot of different
02:05 - pools you can use if you want but this
02:06 - is the one I'm gonna be doing a tutorial
02:07 - and is this one that I use personally ok
02:10 - so now we're gonna look for claymores
02:12 - miner
02:13 - this miner works with AMD cards and
02:15 - NVIDIA cards and that's why I use it
02:16 - because I have a combination of both so
02:19 - this one also will work if you have two
02:21 - AMD cards two Nvidia cards whatever this
02:23 - is the one that most people use okay so
02:26 - we're just gonna go to this windows link
02:29 - right here it says Bitcoin talk thread
02:31 - now my Internet's quite slow so actually
02:32 - already have the link opened up here and
02:34 - now you're gonna see this huge thing
02:36 - features whatever all you want to look
02:38 - for is Google right here or mega either
02:40 - way that you want to download it I
02:41 - personally just go with Google you click
02:43 - on that link and it should bring you to
02:45 - a page that looks like this and it is a
02:47 - shared Google Drive right here that has
02:50 - all the different versions of Claim
02:52 - worst miner so all you're gonna do is
02:54 - you can click on one and then you're
02:56 - gonna go up here and you're gonna click
02:58 - on the download button now obviously I
03:00 - already have it downloaded so I'm not
03:02 - gonna do that but you just pick whatever
03:03 - version you want and then download it
03:05 - try to look for the most recent one okay
03:08 - now that we've done that we can put this
03:09 - aside and we should have our miner
03:12 - so you're gonna get a folder that has a
03:14 - bunch of different things and it's gonna
03:15 - be this exact name it's gonna say
03:17 - claymores dual aetherium minor I
03:19 - personally I just renamed it to minor
03:21 - because it looks cleaner on my desktop
03:23 - okay so now that you've done that you
03:25 - want to open it up and now inside you're
03:28 - gonna see a bunch of different stuff and
03:29 - there is something we need to do here so
03:32 - we actually need to create a new text
03:34 - file so we're gonna go new and then text
03:37 - document now I just like to name this
03:40 - ether mine or start or go so in this
03:43 - case I'm just going to name it go
03:44 - doesn't really matter what you name it
03:45 - as long as it's different from
03:46 - everything else in the folder so I'm
03:47 - just gonna name it go then I'm gonna
03:49 - click Edit it's gonna load us up into
03:53 - the text document here and now we're
03:55 - gonna refer back to the first website we
03:57 - were on ether mind don't work now
04:00 - underneath claymores here there is a
04:02 - white box that has all this different
04:04 - stuff here you don't have to worry about
04:06 - what any of this means
04:07 - all you have to do is copy it like that
04:09 - so ctrl C and paste it into your text
04:12 - document now the last line is what we're
04:15 - gonna be associating ourselves with in
04:16 - just a minute so for right now we're
04:18 - just gonna save and we're gonna move
04:20 - over and create an aetherium wallet so
04:22 - if you do not already have an aetherium
04:24 - wallet you need to follow these steps in
04:26 - making one
04:26 - if you do just fast forward the video a
04:28 - little bit and you'll see when we're
04:30 - using our aetherium wallet okay so I
04:33 - personally like to use a website called
04:35 - my ether wallet comm I'm gonna put that
04:37 - link in the description again you can
04:39 - use any etherium wallet you want any
04:40 - etherion website however you like to do
04:43 - it but this is the version and the
04:45 - website that I use personally so what we
04:47 - need to do is we need to create a new
04:48 - wallet so we're right here it says new
04:50 - wallet just make sure that's selected
04:51 - and now we're gonna create a password
04:53 - obviously you want to make sure this is
04:54 - very secure as this gonna encrypt you
04:56 - one of your files that you need to use
04:58 - to open your wallet so in this case I'm
05:00 - gonna do the most secure password I know
05:02 - one two three four five six seven eight
05:03 - because I already have a wallet so
05:05 - doesn't matter alright we're gonna
05:07 - create our new wallet oh it has to be at
05:09 - least nine characters okay there we go
05:11 - one two three four five six seven eight
05:13 - nine now what you're gonna want to do is
05:15 - you're gonna want to download this
05:16 - keystore file so make sure you keep this
05:19 - safe I'm gonna click it right now to
05:22 - download to show you make sure you keep
05:24 - it on multiple devices so maybe a laptop
05:27 - and your desktop or you have an offline
05:28 - location like a USB Drive because you do
05:31 - need that to access your wallet now your
05:33 - private key same thing with this you're
05:35 - gonna want to copy this and put it in a
05:36 - text document I don't really need this
05:38 - because I'm not actually gonna use this
05:40 - wallet but this is another way that you
05:41 - can access your wallet okay so save that
05:44 - and then move on so now if you want to
05:46 - unlock your wallet you can use the
05:48 - keystore file that you just downloaded
05:50 - so from your downloads if I can find my
05:53 - downloads and you have to type in the
05:55 - password alright like that and then you
06:00 - should be able to unlock your wallet and
06:02 - see your balance okay so that's it
06:04 - that's all I'm going to show you for
06:05 - your wallet
06:06 - now what you need to do is you need to
06:08 - actually take your private key so just
06:11 - if you scroll down after opening up your
06:13 - wallet there's something that says your
06:15 - address so sorry not your private key
06:17 - this is your public key is what it's
06:19 - known as you're just gonna copy this to
06:20 - your clipboard is we're gonna need to
06:22 - use this for the next step so this is
06:25 - actually what you can send all your
06:26 - aetherium to so this is how the miner is
06:30 - gonna recognize you and how you're gonna
06:31 - be sent aetherium okay so copy that and
06:35 - then we're gonna go back to that notepad
06:38 - that we made I hope you didn't close it
06:40 - yeah
06:40 - so right here we can see in these
06:43 - greater-than signs and less than signs
06:45 - it says your aetherium address so
06:48 - obviously our address is what we just
06:49 - copied so what we're gonna do is we're
06:51 - gonna paste it right in there and we can
06:53 - get rid of the greater than and less
06:55 - than signs okay and now your rig name so
07:00 - you can call this whatever you want the
07:03 - only reason they have this is for people
07:04 - that have multiple rigs so they can know
07:06 - if one goes offline if one is online and
07:08 - so on so in this case I'm just gonna
07:09 - call mine bedroom because guess where my
07:12 - computer's all right and now the last
07:15 - step is choosing what pool we want to go
07:18 - with so this is our pool right here but
07:21 - there is different pools within this
07:22 - pool at different servers right here so
07:25 - there is us-1 us-2
07:27 - EU and then Asia one so according to
07:31 - where you live you're gonna choose the
07:33 - appropriate one so in this case I live
07:35 - in Canada but the closest one to me
07:36 - would be US one so I'm gonna use u.s.
07:40 - one now the numbers at the end here
07:43 - indicate which one is the correct like
07:48 - key that you need to put in kind of I
07:50 - don't know how to exactly know how to
07:51 - explain it I just pick one of these
07:53 - numbers so for us one you can use either
07:55 - one four four four four or four four
07:58 - four four in this case we're just gonna
08:00 - stick with what we have here so four
08:02 - four four four actually you know what
08:03 - we'll put the one there just because all
08:07 - right and then if you're using Asia you
08:08 - can use the other ones like this okay so
08:11 - here it says you either mind or all
08:13 - right now all we need to do is we need
08:16 - to change the file extension here so
08:17 - that this runs as a batch file so we
08:20 - need to do is we do file save as and now
08:23 - you're gonna change this save type to
08:26 - all files and you're going to do instead
08:28 - of go dot text you're gonna do go dot
08:30 - bat so that stands for batch file and
08:33 - you're just gonna save it in the same
08:35 - directory as where your miner folder was
08:37 - so where you made that text document
08:39 - okay so we go ahead we've saved that so
08:42 - now all we need to do to start mining is
08:44 - we actually need to find that file so go
08:46 - to about and double click it now you can
08:49 - see it loads up a bunch of different
08:50 - text here it's going to be slow
08:52 - especially the first time you run
08:54 - of configuring some files so just let it
08:55 - run so here it's detected my two
08:57 - graphics cards that's good if it doesn't
09:00 - do that you can have to play around with
09:03 - some of the settings you've got going on
09:04 - your computer to make sure that that
09:06 - happens now it's creating the buffer so
09:09 - we're just going to wait a second to see
09:11 - when it starts mining
09:13 - okay so just give it a minute just
09:15 - creating all these buffers this does
09:17 - take a minute or two and while we're
09:19 - doing that we can actually go to the
09:23 - ether mind website to get ready to see
09:25 - if our miner is actually working now
09:27 - this is a good website you can use to
09:29 - track your miners progress say you're
09:31 - out and you want to make sure that your
09:33 - miner is still online it's still running
09:35 - you can do so from that website so what
09:38 - I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just paste my
09:41 - address into the address thing up here
09:44 - and click enter like so uh now I'm gonna
09:49 - click accept and close and you can see
09:50 - obviously nothing is running right now
09:52 - because I haven't started running now
09:54 - there you go you can see that we've
09:56 - loaded up here and we see the speed so
09:58 - our mega hashes per second for each of
10:00 - the GPUs like so now I'm just gonna
10:03 - close mine because I am recording a
10:04 - video right now so I want to make sure
10:07 - that the frames stay okay now when you
10:10 - do that you should be able to see in a
10:12 - few minutes so it does take a minute or
10:14 - two once your miners running you'll hear
10:16 - the fans on your GPUs run up and then
10:18 - once you've punched in your address here
10:20 - you should
10:20 - if by refreshing the page be able to see
10:23 - the hash rate come up and the active
10:25 - workers and then down here it'll give
10:26 - you a bunch of graphs and it'll tell you
10:29 - all your workers and your estimated
10:31 - payout so if you go to payouts and
10:33 - rounds you can see how much your
10:34 - estimated to make per month obviously
10:36 - it's zero right now because my minor is
10:38 - not run and yeah that's pretty much it
10:41 - for how to mine aetherium
