00:00 - hey guys you were about to see 15 of the
00:02 - coolest Python projects I've made in the
00:05 - past three years I start with the most
00:07 - basic ones that I made a few years ago
00:09 - and get progressively more complicated
00:11 - and difficult so if you're being bored
00:13 - by the beginner videos skip forward a
00:15 - few minutes but if you want to see my
00:17 - progression and kind of how I got better
00:18 - and better through the years then
00:20 - definitely stay tuned for the entire
00:21 - video I think it's really cool to see
00:23 - that and some of the projects at the end
00:25 - I'm sure are going to impress you guys
00:26 - so with that being said I'll let you
00:28 - enjoy the video and I'd love to hear
00:30 - your feedback in the comments down below
00:31 - if you guys are interested in running or
00:33 - looking at any of the code that you see
00:35 - in this video all you have to do is go
00:37 - to my github there will be links for
00:38 - each project in the description down
00:40 - below go into the project and look in
00:42 - this readme file and click open and get
00:44 - pod when you do this it's gonna bring up
00:46 - an online IDE this is completely free
00:48 - and you'll be able to see a preview of
00:50 - the code running on the right hand side
00:52 - interact with it and play with it now
00:54 - this first project that I'm showing you
00:55 - is the start of my kind of graphics
00:57 - career if I were to say that so before
01:00 - this project all I've done with Python
01:02 - was very basic text kind of projects
01:04 - which I'm not going to show you because
01:05 - they're really boring but this was
01:07 - hangman made with Pi game now this was
01:10 - really basic but it did actually take a
01:11 - long time to program because I was still
01:13 - learning how PI games work believe it or
01:15 - not trying to get these circles working
01:17 - and stuff like that was more difficult
01:18 - than it looks
01:19 - this next project is still one of my
01:21 - favorites to this day and it is my
01:23 - version of Microsoft Paint with Python
01:26 - now again we had to make this in our
01:28 - programming class but you can see that
01:30 - it's a really basic kind of drawing
01:32 - program and I added a bunch of tools
01:34 - that weren't required that I was really
01:35 - proud of when I was younger and doing
01:37 - this in grade 11 so just different
01:38 - strokes for drawing I have this fill
01:40 - tool which allowed me to kind of fill
01:42 - different shapes as you can see here I
01:44 - had this replaced tool which replaced
01:46 - whatever color you selected with that
01:49 - other color that's here I had a clear
01:51 - and I also added an option to save my
01:53 - work so if I'd to go ahead and try to
01:55 - save my work here as paint and then I
01:57 - see you can see it saves up at the top
01:59 - here and then I can clear this and open
02:01 - up my work and start working on it again
02:03 - like that now if you try to do something
02:06 - enclosed when you don't have it saved
02:07 - will ask you if you want to save before
02:08 - closing you can do that and then it will
02:10 - close the program this next project is
02:12 - something that's
02:13 - / simple but I really wanted to show it
02:14 - to you guys because it kind of proves
02:16 - that sometimes you don't need to have a
02:17 - super complicated program to do
02:20 - something interesting and something fun
02:21 - which is a turtle race in Python now I
02:24 - actually teach programming to kids in a
02:26 - classroom throughout the summer and
02:27 - something that I usually run in the
02:29 - background when they're doing their free
02:30 - work or whatever work it is is this
02:33 - Python turtle race program I get each
02:34 - kid to pick a turtle I have it set up so
02:37 - you can do as many turtles as you want
02:38 - and at the end of the day we look at the
02:40 - text file that has all the scores and
02:41 - figure out which turtle won the most
02:43 - amount of races usually I'll give them a
02:45 - prize or do something like that but they
02:46 - absolutely love watching it and it's
02:48 - just something I wanted to show you guys
02:49 - because I really enjoy this program and
02:51 - it's kind of cool so this next project
02:53 - is what I call email storage so what it
02:56 - does is it opens up a window for you you
02:58 - have to type the master password in and
03:00 - once you do that it will bring you to
03:02 - this little container where you can
03:03 - store all of your emails and The
03:04 - Associated passwords passwords with them
03:07 - you can also add a name so for example
03:08 - maybe Tim and then in my email so maybe
03:11 - Tim at gmail.com which is not actually
03:13 - my email and that password 1 2 3 4 click
03:16 - add email it will tell you what it added
03:18 - and then you can see it in here now if I
03:20 - close the program and I go back in you
03:23 - can see that this email is still
03:24 - obviously here and one of my most proud
03:27 - moments with this project was I actually
03:29 - messed with hashing which means that the
03:31 - password that I have here was actually
03:34 - well kind of slightly encrypted it's a
03:36 - very basic encryption algorithm but that
03:39 - way you can't just read the plaintext
03:41 - passwords from the text file that is
03:43 - stored this next project I made is an
03:44 - a-star pathfinding visualization now
03:48 - right now I don't have it set to show
03:49 - the steps but essentially what you could
03:51 - do is draw a bunch of obstacles on the
03:52 - screen click the spacebar wait a second
03:55 - and it would find a path from this point
03:57 - to that point it should be the shortest
03:59 - path now this is kind of weird because
04:01 - it goes on diagonals because I don't
04:02 - have it set to have like diagonals be
04:05 - cost more to go to then regular blocks
04:07 - and that's something I want to fix but
04:09 - you can see how that works now if I
04:12 - rerun the program so just by simply
04:13 - doing this you can see that I can
04:15 - actually pick my start point and end
04:16 - point and if I wanted to see a
04:18 - visualization of how this is actually
04:19 - working what the computer is doing in
04:21 - the background I do show steps and then
04:23 - if I draw my path like
04:25 - and hit space you can see that it shows
04:27 - me exactly where we're looking for the
04:29 - next point I think it's pretty cool I'm
04:31 - not gonna let this run because it does
04:33 - take a fair amount of time to get
04:34 - through but you guys are welcome to play
04:36 - around with it on that github and get
04:38 - pod thing that I showed you earlier okay
04:40 - so this is by far my favorite project
04:43 - that I've ever made and this is super
04:45 - mini-golf in PI game with real physics
04:47 - in 2d now it features a full ball shop
04:50 - here where you can use your coins to
04:52 - purchase different balls then you can
04:53 - equip whatever ones you want and if you
04:56 - go ahead and select the course I only
04:58 - have one right now you can play
05:00 - mini-golf in PI game with Python now it
05:04 - is a few different power-ups appear like
05:05 - Mulligan Power Shot sticky ball and it's
05:08 - just like such an awesome project that I
05:10 - had a really fun time making it's
05:11 - probably about 2,500 lines of code and
05:14 - about I want to say maybe a hundred
05:16 - hours of coding because I had to do all
05:18 - the physics and everything completely
05:20 - from scratch and you guys can just see
05:21 - it's awesome I really like it every one
05:24 - that I show it to is really impressed by
05:25 - it and it shows you know if you put
05:28 - enough hard work you can make something
05:29 - that's really cool so this is the full
05:31 - kind of score sheet here and I won't
05:33 - play through all of it if you guys want
05:34 - to mess with it again it's in the github
05:35 - link so just click a link in the
05:37 - description and let me know how well you
05:39 - can do on my course so this project is
05:41 - blackjack in Python with PI game now
05:45 - this I probably did in my spare time
05:46 - over a weekend or week or whatever but
05:49 - essentially just blackjack where you can
05:50 - bet and you can play against the dealer
05:52 - so I'll reveal my cards here maybe I
05:55 - want to hit I can go ahead and hit get
05:57 - another card I'm at 21 so obviously I'm
05:59 - gonna stay and see if I can beat the
06:01 - dealer now in this case we actually tied
06:03 - but again you know you can keep playing
06:05 - it's a little bit glitchy it as it's not
06:06 - responding thing just because the way
06:08 - I'm running it right now but go ahead
06:09 - play this game and you know let me know
06:11 - what you guys think of it in the
06:12 - description down below so this next
06:13 - project is a PI game side-scrolling game
06:16 - there's not really much to say about it
06:18 - it's kind of just like a standard like
06:20 - run along the screen and avoid the
06:21 - obstacles I don't know I had fun making
06:23 - it if any of you guys have been
06:24 - subscribed for a long time and I mean
06:26 - like a really long time you will have
06:28 - remembered me making this video as a
06:30 - tutorial series it's still up on my
06:31 - channel now if you guys are interested
06:33 - in learning how to make something
06:34 - similar similar to this I will
06:36 - or on the github you'll be able to see a
06:38 - link to the video for it so this next
06:40 - project is the python snake game now you
06:43 - guys can see you really well why would
06:45 - it made something like this because you
06:46 - know python and snakes go really well
06:48 - together if you guys fall in my twitter
06:50 - you would have heard that joke already
06:51 - but anyways this actually remember
06:54 - programming at the airport on my way
06:56 - home from school so this was a pretty
06:59 - quick code for me probably took me about
07:01 - two hours I think I finished it up on
07:03 - the plane on my way back and anyways if
07:05 - you'd like to see a tutorial on how to
07:07 - create this actually have one on my
07:08 - channel and you'll be able to see that
07:10 - being that github link for the project
07:12 - and another classic game which is Tetris
07:15 - so again if you guys have been skirt
07:17 - subscribe to the channel maybe since
07:19 - like about 10,000 subscribers you've
07:21 - probably seen this video tutorial just a
07:23 - really simple basic Tetris game in
07:25 - Python I added some tweaks to this
07:27 - version just to make it a little bit
07:28 - smoother and fix up some bugs you know
07:31 - nothing really more to say then this is
07:33 - Tetris so this is another project that I
07:35 - actually really like and it's sudoko so
07:37 - I'm actually a big Sudoku player I like
07:39 - to play on my phone a lot when I'm bored
07:40 - and I would say I'm pretty good so
07:42 - actually what I ended up doing was first
07:44 - creating an algorithm that could solve
07:46 - any Sudoku board for me and then what I
07:48 - did is created a nice GUI and allowed me
07:50 - to play the game so maybe I want to try
07:52 - to put like a number here I can pencil
07:54 - it in just by clicking the number in the
07:56 - box I can delete it by hitting the
07:58 - Delete key on my keyboard and then if
08:00 - I'm ready to submit my answer what I can
08:02 - do is hit enter and if it's correct it
08:04 - will go in now if I try to put one here
08:06 - I get X on the bottom of my screen
08:08 - saying that I got that wrong now if I
08:10 - want to fill in the board I'm done
08:11 - playing or I give up
08:12 - I can click the spacebar and I can watch
08:14 - this nice little graphical
08:15 - representation of how the algorithm
08:17 - actually works go ahead and solve the
08:19 - Sudoku board for me now again I'm
08:21 - getting these weird errors just because
08:22 - of the way that I'm running this program
08:23 - through subline text but usually this
08:26 - just works fine and you know you can see
08:28 - the board filled in so this next project
08:29 - I'm showing you right away does not look
08:31 - like Python but it's actually my python
08:33 - discord bot now this has been a work in
08:36 - progress for a long time and I'm
08:37 - constantly updating it but some of the
08:39 - cool features it has is commands like
08:41 - scoreboard which show you the top users
08:44 - in beach discord server by messages so
08:46 - you can see these are some of my staff
08:48 - members here that have like 5,000
08:50 - ages and whatnot you can look up
08:52 - individual user messages I mean you can
08:54 - read these commands you can wrap users
08:56 - if they've been doing a good job and
08:57 - helping you out in the server and then I
08:59 - also have this FAQ channel which uses a
09:01 - nice machine learning algorithm and you
09:03 - can tag the bot and just ask you basic
09:07 - questions about myself
09:08 - so like hello I bought hi there how can
09:10 - I help you could be like how old is Tim
09:14 - at not bought Oh at BOTS and then it
09:18 - will answer with appropriate answers and
09:21 - these aren't hard coded responses it's a
09:23 - machine learning model so it does a
09:24 - decent job at kind of picking that up
09:26 - but if you guys want to test this out
09:27 - and have a look at the bots definitely
09:29 - join my discord server and become a part
09:31 - of the community so this next project is
09:33 - probably one of the most advanced
09:35 - projects I've ever worked on and this is
09:36 - what I actually did when I screamed for
09:38 - 18 hours straight coding if you haven't
09:41 - seen that yet you should definitely
09:42 - check out the stream I'll try to leave a
09:43 - link to in the description but remind me
09:45 - if I don't where I created an online
09:47 - multiplayer chess game now you can see
09:51 - here that if I run two games and I'm
09:53 - just running this localhost right now
09:54 - that I can actually play against myself
09:56 - in chess now this seems like well why
09:59 - would we have them on the same computer
10:00 - well this actually works on a server
10:02 - client kind of system which means that
10:05 - you can run the server on any computer
10:07 - on the world and is around the world and
10:09 - then you can play these games from
10:10 - different computers so I actually did a
10:12 - follow-up livestream to when I created
10:14 - this project where I hosted the game on
10:16 - my own server and I played against for
10:18 - like 20 or 30 of you guys on the stream
10:20 - which was a lot of fun and you can also
10:21 - check that one out on my channel but
10:23 - again really cool project this with you
10:26 - sockets Python threading all kinds of
10:29 - crazy modules and I think I did this in
10:31 - I don't even know what month I didn't
10:34 - send maybe like February or something
10:36 - like that but it was a big hit and I'm
10:39 - gonna show you guys later another live
10:40 - stream I did where I created a cool
10:42 - project similar to this so I'm sure most
10:44 - of you guys already note this is but
10:46 - this is a tower defense game made with
10:48 - Python and PI game and I did this in 12
10:51 - hours with no breaks it's about 1500
10:54 - lines of code so let me show it to you
10:56 - so I'm sure most of you guys have
10:57 - already seen this but essentially it is
10:59 - just like a standard tower defense game
11:01 - you can buy towers on the side
11:03 - you're using your currency you can
11:05 - upgrade them if you have enough coins or
11:07 - stars by doing that you can toggle the
11:09 - music on and off and then you can buy
11:11 - these utility towers which allow you to
11:13 - strengthen things like damage and range
11:16 - of the towers that you place to have the
11:18 - wave to start running you click this
11:21 - pause and play button and this took a
11:23 - ton of work but a massive thank you to
11:26 - everyone that was in the stream because
11:27 - even today I still think about it it was
11:29 - a lot of fun and I'm definitely planning
11:30 - on doing another one if you want to see
11:32 - another one let me know what I should
11:33 - make in the comments down below and
11:35 - quick sidenote
11:35 - unfortunately you won't be able to run
11:37 - this project because the assets I use in
11:39 - here are premium paid assets which means
11:41 - I can't release them for free on github
11:43 - alright so this is the last and most
11:45 - recent Python project I made which was
11:47 - probably about a few days ago and this
11:49 - is a live facial detection and
11:51 - recognition program now I promise you
11:54 - it's not just labeling this Tim it
11:55 - actually works on other images and if
11:57 - you don't believe me you can go check
11:58 - out my Twitter where I do a little bit
12:00 - of a longer video on kind of how it
12:02 - works but this is cool this may have
12:04 - always wanted to make it just uses the
12:06 - facial detection module in Python and I
12:08 - don't know I think it's pretty
12:09 - interesting as you guys can see here so
12:11 - with that being said I'm going to wrap
12:13 - up the video here I hope I gave you guys
12:15 - some ideas and inspiration for some
12:17 - Python projects and if you did enjoy the
12:20 - video please make sure you hit that like
12:21 - button and subscribe to the channel to
12:23 - see all the future stuff that I'm going
12:25 - to be creating finally if you're not
12:27 - already join the discord server follow
12:30 - me on Twitter go to my Instagram all of
12:32 - that fun stuff and with that being said
12:34 - I will see you guys in another video
