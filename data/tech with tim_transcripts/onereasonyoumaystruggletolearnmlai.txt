00:00 - if you want to get good at machine
00:01 - learning this is not something you're
00:03 - going to do overnight you're not going
00:04 - to learn it in a month or a week or
00:06 - something like that this is going to
00:07 - take time a lot of practice and can
00:09 - definitely be very frustrating and
00:11 - intimidating as you're getting into it
00:12 - at the start I see a lot of people on my
00:14 - channel you'll want to go and build Ai
00:15 - and that's great I definitely encourage
00:17 - them to try to do that but you will
00:19 - reach a point where your lack of math
00:21 - understanding May hold you back and then
00:24 - you're gonna have to spend time winning
00:25 - some fairly advanced math concepts like
00:27 - linear algebra calculus gradient descent
00:30 - for example and unlike programming you
00:32 - do actually need to have a decent math
00:34 - background to really make good use and
00:37 - understand what is going on in machine
00:39 - learning
