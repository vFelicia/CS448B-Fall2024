00:00 - hey guys and welcome to a brand new
00:02 - tutorial series so in this series I'm
00:05 - going to be teaching you Java from the
00:07 - beginning so starting at the abso basic
00:09 - setting up an environment how to create
00:12 - variables methods like all that stuff
00:14 - and then move it all the way up into the
00:15 - advanced stuff so I'm projecting this
00:17 - tutorial series is probably gonna be
00:19 - somewhere around 20 videos not exactly
00:22 - sure in that after that tutorial series
00:24 - just so you're aware I will be going
00:25 - into a Java game development series so
00:28 - make sure you're subscribed for that
00:30 - anyways let's just get started with Java
00:33 - actually quickly I'm just going to say
00:35 - that this is a beginner tutorial series
00:37 - so I'm gonna treat this as if you have
00:39 - never learned any programming language
00:41 - before so if you're someone who does
00:43 - have a programming language and you just
00:44 - want to learn job and kind of go through
00:45 - it quickly watch the first few minutes
00:47 - of the video wait until you understand
00:49 - the content and move to the next one if
00:50 - you're an absolute beginner I'd
00:52 - recommend sticking through the whole
00:53 - video and making sure you really
00:55 - understand everything that I'm saying
00:56 - before you move on okay so let's go
00:59 - ahead and get started the first thing we
01:00 - need to do is download a IDE and this is
01:03 - where we're gonna be writing our java
01:04 - code okay so it's called eclipse this
01:07 - one I'm gonna use use whatever you want
01:08 - but if you're a beginner I recommend you
01:10 - just follow along with this because the
01:11 - some of the things I'm gonna do are
01:12 - specific to eclipse so go to this link
01:15 - it's in the description down below and
01:17 - just click on download and then
01:19 - obviously 32 or 64-bit
01:21 - I recommend 64-bit as most TV you
01:23 - probably have a 64-bit machine once you
01:25 - download this if we go sorry I've
01:27 - already got an open here but if we go to
01:29 - our downloads we will see that it should
01:31 - give us something like this double click
01:34 - on it wait for this to boot up might
01:36 - take a second ok it's going it's going
01:40 - let's see and once we're in here we're
01:43 - simply going to select Eclipse IDE for
01:45 - Java developers we don't need to be
01:47 - using any of this other stuff just this
01:50 - one right here ok so we're going to
01:52 - install this I already have it installed
01:53 - so I'm not going to do that now it is
01:55 - gonna ask you for a project directory
01:58 - something like that so if it asked you
02:00 - for that just choose wherever on your
02:01 - computer it doesn't really matter ok so
02:05 - once you've had that installed you chose
02:07 - your project directory now we're gonna
02:08 - be in Eclipse now to start a new
02:11 - projects what we need to do so it should
02:13 - look something like the
02:14 - you know click on file new and then Java
02:17 - project now here I'm just gonna name
02:19 - mine tutorial and then let's see here
02:23 - you can just leave all the rest of this
02:24 - stuff blank if you want to change the
02:26 - location go ahead alright click finish
02:28 - and there we are so once we have this
02:31 - it's gonna pop up at our left bar the
02:32 - package Explorer I'm just gonna shrink
02:34 - this a little bit and what we're gonna
02:35 - do is are gonna go down to source or oh
02:37 - I already have a package name tutorial
02:39 - one second I'm just gonna create a new
02:40 - one really quickly and then walk you
02:42 - through this so it's fresh tutorial one
02:45 - okay finish all right we got two toriel
02:48 - one and we get source okay
02:51 - now inside of the source what we're
02:53 - gonna do is we're going to right-click
02:53 - on this we're gonna click new and we're
02:55 - going to click on package now I
02:57 - recommend you just leave this package
02:59 - name the same as your project so I'm
03:02 - gonna do that and click finish and then
03:04 - inside of your package name I'm going to
03:06 - click new and class ok so once I click
03:10 - class it's gonna pop up here it's gonna
03:11 - lie to select the package and the source
03:13 - will to just leave those blank and the
03:15 - name you can name this whatever you want
03:16 - in my case I'm gonna name it main ok
03:18 - type name is discouraged okay
03:22 - so let's name it main with a capital M
03:24 - alright just because you have a likes
03:26 - that and then we're gonna do is make
03:27 - sure you check on this public static
03:29 - void main we need to check mark this
03:31 - because we're gonna need this function
03:32 - created us so that we can start all
03:34 - right I inherited abstract method you
03:36 - can uncheck that you are actually will
03:38 - check that does really matter if right
03:39 - now okay so now we're in and we've got a
03:42 - little bit of code going here and I'm
03:44 - gonna explain what this is and then
03:47 - we'll get into just coding like a really
03:48 - basic thing just printing a few things
03:50 - to the screen before we move into the
03:51 - next tutorial where we talk about
03:52 - datatypes so Java is an object
03:55 - orientated program language meaning that
03:57 - everything happens inside of something
03:58 - called classes and everything is known
04:00 - as like objects alright now you're not
04:02 - gonna understand very much about of this
04:04 - right now if you're beginner but for
04:05 - some of you guys that are more advanced
04:06 - you should kind of understand what this
04:08 - means
04:08 - so classes are these okay and everything
04:11 - in Java is written in a class or an
04:13 - interface or something else but in our
04:15 - purpose just think everything is written
04:16 - in a class right now okay now inside of
04:19 - this class we have a special method is
04:22 - what it's called and these methods are
04:23 - what I'm highlighting right now inside
04:26 - these curly brackets
04:27 - like static void main okay you don't
04:29 - have to know what all that those words
04:30 - mean just know this method is important
04:33 - and this is we're gonna be writing all
04:34 - of our Java code in for right now so if
04:36 - you try to write code outside of these
04:38 - little curly braces not inside of this
04:40 - method that's what we're calling it
04:42 - right now okay your code is not gonna
04:44 - execute properly unless you know what
04:45 - you're doing which in our case we don't
04:47 - yet so all the code we're writing goes
04:49 - inside of this public static void main
04:52 - inside of these curly braces all right
04:54 - now the first thing I'm gonna get us to
04:56 - do is just print something to the screen
04:58 - so to print something in Java we're
05:00 - gonna type system dot out dot my
05:05 - computer vlogging one second dot println
05:06 - and this simply stands for print line
05:10 - okay now inside of these brackets here
05:12 - we can print a string or whatever we
05:14 - want to print so a string in Java is
05:17 - anything encapsulated by two quotation
05:19 - marks whenever we're printing something
05:21 - we want to do it in two quotation marks
05:22 - at least for right now and in this case
05:24 - I'm going to say the classic hello world
05:27 - with an exclamation point okay now at
05:30 - the end of every line we write in Java
05:32 - with exception of lines that start or
05:35 - end with curly braces we need to put a
05:38 - semicolon and now you can see once I put
05:41 - the semicolon that our system dot out
05:43 - dot println gets highlighted and we can
05:45 - see that it now has syntax highlighting
05:47 - and syntax pretty much means any code
05:49 - that we write in the program so we have
05:52 - to make sure that whenever we're done
05:53 - writing a line we terminate that with a
05:55 - semicolon
05:56 - okay so now we've officially written our
05:58 - first program all it does is print hello
06:00 - world to the screen but how can we run
06:02 - this so first we're gonna have to saves
06:05 - I'm gonna hackin troll s and to run this
06:07 - there's a little green button up here
06:09 - and it says run main dot Java so we're
06:11 - gonna click that and you can see that
06:13 - down here a little thing popped up
06:15 - called console and we printed to the
06:17 - screen hello world now that we've
06:20 - officially created our first java
06:21 - application very simple and that is how
06:25 - we go about setting up a new class and
06:27 - everything that we write for right now
06:28 - again remember is gonna happen inside
06:30 - this method that's what we're calling it
06:31 - I'm gonna explain that later public
06:33 - static void main we have to put in here
06:36 - now if you want to print another line
06:38 - you want print something else after we
06:40 - can do that I'll show you how that we're
06:41 - so I'm gonna say system dot out dot
06:43 - println and I'll say like hello world
06:45 - too and if I save this and run again we
06:48 - get hello world and hello world too
06:51 - now that has been the introduction
06:53 - tutorial in the next video i'm gonna go
06:55 - into datatypes and probe datatypes and
06:58 - we're gonna talk about like integers and
07:00 - strings and all of that fun stuff so if
07:03 - you guys enjoy the video and you're
07:04 - excited for the next one make sure you
07:05 - leave a like and subscribe and I will
07:06 - see you there
