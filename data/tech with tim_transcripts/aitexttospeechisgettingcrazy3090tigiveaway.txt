00:07 - so I think many of you will agree with
00:09 - me that one of the most frustrating
00:10 - things in the world is communicating
00:12 - with an AI for example you pick up the
00:15 - phone you call your bank or you call
00:16 - some company you deal with you get
00:18 - directed to this really robotic voice
00:20 - that asks you a bunch of questions and I
00:22 - don't know if it's just me but I have to
00:23 - repeat myself countless times to this AI
00:26 - before it actually understands what I'm
00:28 - saying and then it directs me to a human
00:30 - where I just have to re-explain it
00:31 - anyways very very frustrating and while
00:33 - I just wish the AI was better now that's
00:35 - kind of why I'm excited to share with
00:36 - you this video where I'm gonna demo some
00:38 - of the recent advancements in
00:40 - text-to-speech and speech to text it's
00:42 - pretty crazy how accurate the speech to
00:44 - text is and how good some of the voices
00:46 - sound now for text-to-speech and the
00:48 - best part of this is that whatever I'm
00:50 - showing you here you guys can actually
00:51 - go use and you can customize it based on
00:54 - your domain and the application that
00:55 - you're building now before I get into
00:57 - that I need to show you this very heavy
00:58 - box that I'm holding which is a signed
01:01 - 3090 TI now this is signed by Jensen who
01:04 - is the CEO of Nvidia and if you watch
01:06 - through this whole video I'll share with
01:07 - you you how you can enter to win this
01:09 - massive GPU alright so let me share with
01:11 - you the Texas speech and speech to text
01:13 - advancements I was discussing now this
01:15 - is provided by Nvidia I've teamed up
01:17 - with them for this video hence why I
01:18 - have the GPU which I'll tell you how to
01:20 - win in a second and I'm going to show
01:21 - you the Nvidia Riva or Riva kind of
01:24 - toolkit slash SDK now I believe it's
01:27 - Riva I don't know exactly how you
01:28 - pronounce it but this is a GPU
01:30 - accelerated SDK for building speech AI
01:32 - now the cool thing about this is that
01:34 - you can customize this for your use case
01:36 - so if you're a specific business and
01:38 - maybe you have some products that aren't
01:39 - dictionary words you could actually
01:41 - train that into the model so that it can
01:43 - understand those and then it can
01:44 - actually speak those back properly so
01:46 - it's pretty cool how it works and again
01:48 - you can kind of tweak it and make it
01:49 - really custom to what kind of
01:51 - application you're working on so I'll
01:53 - just show you a very quick example here
01:54 - you can see I have some text typed in
01:55 - hello world my name is Tim I'm making a
01:57 - video right now let's try the male voice
01:59 - and then I'll try out the US Voice or
02:01 - not the US voice hello world my name is
02:04 - Tim and I am making a video right now
02:06 - there you go so it still sounds a little
02:08 - bit robotic but this is a lot smoother
02:10 - and kind of softer than your typical
02:11 - robotic voice I feel like it's not as
02:13 - harsh on the ears now let's see the
02:15 - female one hello world my name is Tim
02:18 - and I am making a video right now so
02:20 - there you go in my opinion sounds better
02:21 - than your typical text-to-speech and if
02:24 - I go here to just like a random
02:25 - text-to-speech website that I popped up
02:27 - I can say hello world my name is Tim and
02:30 - I am making a video right now okay let's
02:35 - just fix that let's see how this one
02:37 - sounds hello world my name is Tim and I
02:40 - am making a video right now so I feel
02:42 - like that's a lot more noticeable in
02:44 - terms of being a robotic voice so again
02:45 - this is a random text-to-speech I popped
02:47 - up but hopefully that gives you a decent
02:49 - comparison in terms of the difference
02:50 - between the voices so this is cool and
02:53 - all but text-to-speech just kind of
02:54 - always existed it's just been the
02:56 - quality of the voice what I think is
02:57 - much cooler is actually the speech to
03:00 - text so let me delete all this or let me
03:02 - just refresh this page I have this kind
03:04 - of internal demo that Nvidia gave me and
03:07 - I'll show you that I can pick a model
03:09 - here for whatever language I'm going to
03:10 - speak in so in this case it's going to
03:11 - be English and I can just transcribe
03:14 - whatever I say into the microphone and
03:16 - it will happen in live time which is
03:18 - pretty cool there's really no delay so
03:20 - let's do this here hello world my name
03:22 - is Tim I'm just testing out this speech
03:24 - to text I want to see how accurate and
03:26 - good this model is I usually speak
03:28 - pretty fast so let's see if it can keep
03:30 - up with me and if it can handle all of
03:31 - the words that I'm saying now I do speak
03:33 - clearly compared to a lot of other
03:35 - people but already I can see this is
03:37 - pretty impressive and it's kind of
03:38 - automatically adjusting itself as I go
03:40 - through and adding in say grammar
03:42 - punctuation
03:44 - pauses other things that I add in the
03:47 - text
03:48 - so there you go I've just paused it here
03:49 - but you can see it's pretty good and uh
03:51 - you know it messed up a few words but I
03:53 - think that's fairly common it's adding
03:55 - in the commas it has the proper uh what
03:57 - do you call it capitalization
03:58 - punctuation grammar Etc and I mean you
04:01 - guys can read through and see how
04:01 - accurate it was but I think that's
04:03 - pretty cool and this is definitely
04:04 - better than a lot of other uh Speech and
04:06 - text models I've used in the past and
04:08 - again you guys can use this for free
04:09 - like you can just use the SDK I'll link
04:11 - this in the description
04:12 - continuing we have what's known as the
04:14 - speech synthesis now I think this is
04:17 - like an experimental or kind of new
04:18 - addition because they don't have it
04:21 - directly on the website it's just a demo
04:22 - that they've given me uh access to but
04:25 - what I can actually do here is I can
04:27 - modify the text and change like the
04:28 - pitch or the rate of speed so that I can
04:31 - really customize what output is coming
04:33 - uh from my Texas speech model so for
04:35 - example
04:36 - let's make this first part look really
04:38 - fast so I'll just go rate uh 200 percent
04:41 - okay let's make maybe this part here
04:43 - higher pitch
04:45 - so like negative two pitch and let's
04:47 - generate that
04:48 - read off or something like
04:49 - text-to-speech TTS neural voices that
04:52 - you state of the art spectrogram
04:53 - generation and vocoder models Riva
04:56 - pipelines are customizable and optimize
04:59 - addition real time
05:01 - Riva TTS takes raw text as input and can
05:04 - return audio chunks as soon as they are
05:06 - generated in streaming mode or at the
05:08 - end of the entire sequence in batch mode
05:10 - so there you go you get the point right
05:12 - I think it's not perfect yet but it's
05:13 - kind of cool that you can go in and with
05:14 - like almost HTML tags here you can
05:16 - adjust the different words and the tempo
05:19 - and the pace of the pitch and all that
05:21 - and I imagine the future they'll have
05:22 - some other uh what do you call it I
05:24 - guess parameters here that you can tweak
05:25 - so that's really the main content of the
05:27 - demo that I had for you guys obviously I
05:29 - could do some other text but I think you
05:30 - get the point here just trying to show
05:32 - you that this Tech has really come a
05:34 - long way at least from when I used to
05:36 - mess around with Texas speech and speech
05:37 - to text and all that kind of stuff this
05:39 - is something you can use in your
05:40 - projects if you want again it's called
05:42 - Nvidia Riva I'll leave a link to it and
05:45 - you can actually set up your own
05:46 - Pipeline and add in your own words and
05:48 - change the voice these are just you know
05:50 - these standard demos now you could just
05:52 - use a pre-trained model as well if you
05:54 - don't want to go through all of that
05:55 - work but obviously if this was like for
05:56 - your business or something you'd
05:57 - probably want to tweak this a little bit
05:58 - more and make it really customized to
06:01 - what you're actually doing alright so
06:03 - now I'll quickly tell you how you can
06:04 - win the 3090 ti so of course Nvidia is
06:08 - hosting their GTC again this year which
06:10 - is the global technology conference
06:12 - happening from the 19th to the 22nd
06:14 - there's all kinds of amazing speakers
06:16 - all kinds of workshops tutorials
06:18 - seminars sessions Etc you can learn
06:21 - pretty much whatever you want related to
06:22 - technology Ai and just the future of
06:25 - computing at this conference and the way
06:27 - to enter to win this 39 DTI is to Simply
06:30 - register for this event which is
06:31 - completely free you do not need to pay
06:33 - for this I'll leave a link to it in the
06:35 - description and then just fill out the
06:36 - really short Google form that I have in
06:38 - the description that says that you've
06:40 - registered for the event just let me
06:41 - know what sessions you plan on attending
06:43 - and then I need your emails that I can
06:45 - reach out to you if you are the winner
06:46 - and we can coordinate shipping I will
06:48 - ship anywhere in the world I will cover
06:50 - all of the customs duty taxes whatever
06:53 - it may be I will make sure that you get
06:55 - the GPU so that is it register for the
06:58 - GTC fill out the Google form again I
07:00 - just need to do that so I can get your
07:01 - email and then about a week after this
07:03 - event ends I will pick a winner and I
07:06 - will reach out to you and send you the
07:07 - 3090 TI now before I hop off here I'll
07:10 - just quickly scroll through a few of the
07:11 - sessions you may be interested in here
07:12 - for the GTC so they have all kinds of
07:15 - topics here like computer vision
07:16 - conversational AI that's kind of what
07:18 - we're talking about here right like
07:20 - text-to-speech speech to text cyber
07:22 - security data center data science
07:24 - obviously deep learning neural networks
07:26 - all the kind of stuff that Nvidia does
07:28 - and supports with their Hardware
07:29 - Healthcare video streaming autonomous
07:32 - vehicles anything that you can think of
07:34 - that's kind of future of tech is going
07:36 - to be covered here really cool place to
07:38 - be and again you're going to learn quite
07:39 - a bit if you attend some of these
07:40 - sessions and pretty much all of them are
07:42 - free so with that said I'm going to wrap
07:44 - up the video here obviously I wanted to
07:46 - share with you this 3090 Ti giveaway and
07:48 - talk to you about some advancements in
07:50 - text-to-speech and speech to text
07:51 - hopefully that was helpful and you guys
07:53 - can see some uses for this technology
07:55 - and your own applications with that said
07:57 - look forward to seeing you in another
