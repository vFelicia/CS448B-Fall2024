00:00 - hey guys welcome back to another video
00:02 - in today's video I'm gonna be talking
00:04 - about how you can encrypt a folder and
00:07 - how you can hide it
00:08 - so that if other people are using your
00:10 - computer or you just want to be extra
00:12 - secure about some files you have you can
00:14 - keep them safe and out of the average
00:16 - users eye so just to clarify here this
00:19 - is not an advanced technique it's
00:21 - extremely simple anybody is able to do
00:23 - it and because of that it's also not
00:25 - extremely secure but if you just want a
00:27 - little bit of extra protection on some
00:29 - of your files maybe you're storing a
00:30 - password or something this is a great
00:31 - way that you can do it and it's very
00:32 - easy you don't have to download any
00:34 - other programs so let's go ahead and
00:36 - let's get started so obviously we need a
00:39 - folder or a file that we want to secure
00:41 - so in this case I'm just gonna do a
00:42 - folder I'm just gonna name it secure
00:45 - like that you can name it whatever you
00:47 - want you can place it wherever you want
00:48 - I'm just putting mine on the desktop so
00:50 - that we can see it right there and just
00:51 - note that you can't actually see the
00:53 - folder you can open it up and it's on
00:55 - the desktop right there where my cursor
00:56 - is okay so the first thing we're gonna
00:58 - do here is we're actually just going to
01:01 - populate this folder so I'm just gonna
01:03 - put in a text file name it password and
01:08 - then inside here it doesn't really
01:10 - matter you don't have to put anything
01:11 - that I'm just gonna put one two three
01:13 - like that so that might be our password
01:15 - for something and we want to protect
01:16 - that so now in order to encrypt this
01:19 - folder which is the first step we have
01:21 - to right-click on it scroll all the way
01:23 - down to where it says options or sorry
01:25 - properties so it says properties and
01:28 - then you're gonna click on this Advanced
01:29 - tab under the general setting here okay
01:32 - now here you can see there's a few
01:34 - options what we want to click is encrypt
01:36 - contents to secure data so you're gonna
01:39 - click that checkmark and then you're
01:40 - gonna go ahead and click OK and there
01:43 - you go you've now encrypted it so now we
01:45 - want to do is just click apply and here
01:48 - we go so now it says you have chosen to
01:50 - make the following attribute changes to
01:51 - encrypt so you want to make sure the
01:54 - second one here is checked so apply
01:56 - changes to folder subfolders and files
01:58 - that means anything inside of the folder
02:00 - will also be encrypted go ahead and
02:02 - click OK and there you go you're done so
02:06 - now you've encrypted this file inside of
02:09 - the folder and you can see I can't
02:11 - really zoom in here but if you can see
02:13 - there's a little law
02:13 - on the actual file so it's different if
02:16 - I make a new text file it might we'll
02:18 - see if it puts that lock there yeah so
02:20 - everything inside that folder will be
02:22 - encrypted and you can see that there
02:24 - okay
02:25 - so now the next step so we have it
02:27 - encrypted but if you actually see here
02:29 - we can open it up and it does like it
02:31 - doesn't ask for a password or anything
02:32 - so say someone else is using the same
02:34 - user as you and you wanted to make this
02:37 - more secure what you can actually do is
02:38 - you can hide this folder so you see here
02:41 - on our desktop it shows the folder you
02:43 - can see it the name and the little lock
02:44 - now if we want to actually hide this we
02:46 - can just right click on the folder again
02:48 - you may have seen this option before if
02:50 - we go to properties you can actually
02:51 - checkmark hidden right there and then if
02:54 - you go ahead and apply that so again
02:57 - you're just going to apply to the folder
02:59 - and the subfolders you click OK ok like
03:02 - that you can see the folder actually
03:04 - disappears and if I try to click where
03:05 - it was nothing's popping up and we can't
03:08 - seem to grab it so now the question
03:10 - might be well how do we actually find
03:12 - that folder so if we want to see that
03:15 - folder what we need to do is we need to
03:17 - go to the View tab and our windows
03:18 - explorer and we just need to check mark
03:20 - this box here that says hidden items now
03:23 - when we check that you see two folders
03:25 - come up so the folder that I made before
03:26 - called test doesn't everything in it and
03:29 - then this secure folder right here so
03:33 - again then we can see our password text
03:36 - in there and if we want to hide it all
03:37 - we have to do is go to view and then
03:40 - uncheck hidden items like that now again
03:44 - is an extremely simple task
03:46 - nothing advanced it all about it but
03:48 - just say you want a little extra
03:49 - security on your files that's a really
03:52 - easy way that you can encrypt it and
03:53 - hide it and make sure that the average
03:56 - user won't be able to find it again if
03:58 - you want more security on it then you
04:00 - would have to encrypt it more maybe put
04:02 - a password protection on it but this is
04:04 - just a little bit extra security all
04:06 - right so that's it for this video if you
04:08 - liked please like and subscribe and I
04:11 - will see you again in another video
