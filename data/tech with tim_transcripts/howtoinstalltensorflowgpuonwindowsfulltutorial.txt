00:00 - in this video I'm gonna be showing you
00:01 - how to download and install tensorflow
00:03 - GPU on windows 8 and Windows 10 now this
00:07 - is only gonna work if you have a cuda
00:09 - enabled graphics card now if you don't
00:12 - know what that means the way that you
00:13 - can check this first of all is if your
00:15 - card is in a video graphics card and if
00:18 - it is on this list so if you're not sure
00:21 - if your card has CUDA typically all the
00:23 - newer cards within the past three or
00:25 - four years that are any nvidia cards do
00:27 - have that enabled but to check you can
00:30 - go to the link that i'm gonna have in
00:31 - the description down below and look
00:32 - through this list to attempt to find
00:34 - your graphics card now if you can't find
00:36 - your graphics card at all on this
00:38 - webpage
00:38 - don't bother attempting this as this is
00:40 - not going to work you do need CUDA for
00:43 - tensorflow GPU to work on your machine
00:45 - okay so now that we've done that I'm
00:48 - just going to go over that this is a
00:49 - very tedious process this takes a long
00:51 - time and the steps that you have to do
00:54 - to do this are very important that
00:56 - they're done in the correct order so
00:58 - please watch through the entire video
00:59 - and if you're not sure about something
01:00 - I'm doing pause and rewatchable
01:08 - which I personally had to do when I was
01:10 - installing this and it is a pain so the
01:12 - first step and the first thing we need
01:14 - to do is we need to uninstall all of our
01:16 - Nvidia graphics cards and what he call
01:20 - it drivers sorry not graphics cards so
01:23 - what we're gonna do is we're going to go
01:24 - to whatever the uninstall list is on
01:26 - your computer and just find anything
01:29 - that says in the video so for example
01:31 - I'm going to keep going and you can see
01:32 - I have a ton of Nvidia drivers so I'm
01:34 - not gonna do this because I already have
01:36 - it installed but uninstall all of these
01:38 - now don't worry if you have your
01:40 - graphics drive around here we can
01:41 - reinstall them afterwards but to save us
01:43 - a lot of time uninstall anything that
01:46 - says in the video after we're finished
01:48 - that go to your C Drive and your Program
01:53 - Files times 86 and again find anything
01:56 - that says in the video and delete it so
01:58 - in this case Nvidia corporation just
02:00 - delete this folder all right go back go
02:03 - to now your other Program Files and find
02:06 - anything again that says in the video so
02:07 - Nvidia corporation of idiot GPU
02:09 - computing tool and delete these folders
02:12 - that we
02:12 - and reinstall them afterwards this is
02:14 - just to save you a lot of headache okay
02:17 - so once we're finished with that the
02:19 - next step is to download and install
02:20 - Visual Studio 2017 now all of the links
02:24 - that I'm going to be showing you here
02:25 - are in the description down below and
02:27 - there's a very brief description of all
02:29 - of the steps that you have to take so if
02:30 - you get lost you can read the
02:31 - description but this link right here is
02:33 - gonna lead you to download Visual Studio
02:35 - 2017 download and install the free
02:38 - version and just do whatever it
02:40 - recommends for you so once you've
02:42 - installed that we can move on to the
02:44 - next step now the next step is to check
02:47 - the current version of CUDA so we need
02:50 - to install a CUDA driver to our system
02:53 - so that our graphics card is going to be
02:55 - enabled to use that and to work with
02:57 - tensorflow
02:58 - so go to this web page that again I'm
03:01 - gonna have in the description down below
03:02 - and check what this version says so says
03:05 - NVIDIA GPU drivers check this version so
03:09 - CUDA and 9.0 requires that you have a
03:11 - driver of 384 point X or higher and then
03:14 - CUDA toolkit it will tell you what
03:16 - version of CUDA is currently supported
03:18 - by tensorflow and this is the version
03:19 - that you're going to have to download if
03:21 - you're what if you're not watching this
03:24 - recently and this says like CUDA ten
03:25 - point O or eleven point O then that's
03:27 - what you're gonna have to download in
03:28 - this case I'm gonna have to download
03:30 - version 9.0 so check this webpage and
03:33 - then move on to the next link that is
03:35 - going to be in the description this next
03:37 - link is to download and install CUDA
03:40 - sorry that's the wrong page so this is
03:42 - CUDA toolkit 9.0 now I'm gonna put this
03:46 - link in the description down below again
03:48 - if you have to download CUDA ten point o
03:50 - or a different version please download
03:52 - the correct version I will leave the
03:54 - link that what do you call it goes to
03:57 - all of the different versions so you can
03:59 - pick which one so first we're gonna
04:01 - select our target platform windows and
04:03 - you can see that right now it's asking
04:04 - me to download 10 point oh that's not
04:07 - the one I want I want 9.0 so I'm gonna
04:09 - go back and find nine point oh here we
04:12 - go
04:12 - cool CUDA toolkits 9.0 so I'll leave two
04:14 - links one for 9.0 and one for all the
04:16 - other versions okay and I'll label them
04:18 - in the description we're gonna click on
04:20 - Windows and you're gonna leave that and
04:22 - just click version 10 and you can
04:24 - download and install that and
04:26 - through the installation process now I'm
04:28 - not going to do that as I already have
04:30 - that installed but once that's done you
04:32 - can move on to the next step
04:34 - okay so the next step is downloading and
04:36 - installing si UD nn okay now I'm gonna
04:39 - leave this link obviously in the
04:41 - description again and you need to
04:43 - install the correct version for your
04:45 - version of CUDA so you can see here on
04:47 - this page we have ten point oh and 9.2
04:49 - and 9.0 now obviously for we're using
04:52 - 9.0 so we are going to download from
04:54 - this link once you click this link it
04:57 - should give you a folder that looks like
04:59 - this
04:59 - in your download bar once you get that
05:02 - folder just open it up and you can see
05:03 - that we have a folder called CUDA now
05:06 - we're gonna move to our desktop we're
05:08 - going to extract this folder just by
05:10 - dragging it on there and you can see
05:12 - that once we open this up we have three
05:15 - folders bin include and lip what we need
05:18 - to do now is open up a new file explorer
05:21 - and we need to navigate to Program Files
05:24 - so C Drive Program Files now you can see
05:28 - here that you should now have two
05:30 - folders so after installing CUDA and
05:32 - afternoons are sorry just after
05:34 - installing CUDA I guess you should have
05:36 - a folder that says Nvidia corporation
05:37 - and NVIDIA GPU computing toolkit if you
05:40 - don't have this one it's fine but make
05:41 - sure you have this computing toolkit
05:43 - we're going to go into this folder I'm
05:45 - going to click on CUDA and then we're
05:47 - gonna click on version 9.0 and you can
05:49 - see that we have three similar folders
05:51 - we have been we have Lib and we have
05:54 - include what we need to do is open up
05:56 - the first of all the bin folder and we
05:58 - need to open up the bin folder over here
06:00 - and we're simply going to drag CU DNN in
06:03 - to this folder so you can drag it and it
06:07 - should just copy in there I already have
06:09 - it in there that's why it was causing an
06:11 - issue right so we'll just replace file
06:12 - and destination ok continue and there we
06:16 - go now it's in alright now we need to do
06:18 - the same thing with include so we're
06:20 - gonna go back let me go to include take
06:22 - all the files that are in include and
06:24 - simply drag them in here like this
06:26 - replace file and destination already
06:28 - have them in there but I'll just go
06:29 - through it with you guys okay next one
06:31 - lib same thing times 64 so we'll go back
06:34 - here to Lib we're gonna go inside the
06:37 - times 64 folder inside over here and
06:39 - we're
06:40 - just going to drag this in replace file
06:42 - and destination and just click yes okay
06:45 - so that's all with that si UD n n and
06:48 - that is officially now installed in our
06:49 - system now the next step is to add
06:52 - something to our path so to do this we
06:54 - need to edit our environment variables
06:56 - you can find that just by searching in
06:57 - your bottom windows bar so we go to edit
07:00 - environment variables when you go to
07:02 - environment variables and we're going to
07:04 - go to path now in here we're going to
07:06 - click Edit and we're going to click new
07:08 - now the path that you're going to add is
07:11 - going to be this path and this path okay
07:15 - now I'm gonna leave these in the
07:16 - description I'm also gonna put them up
07:17 - on the screen right now in case you
07:19 - would rather type them out now these two
07:21 - paths this version number is going to
07:23 - change depending on what version of CUDA
07:25 - you have if you have version 8.0 this is
07:27 - going to be eight if you have version 10
07:29 - point O this is going to be 10 other
07:31 - than this these should be the same
07:33 - except for that version number so just
07:35 - check that when you're installing that
07:37 - you have the right version here in your
07:38 - path and again these are in the
07:40 - description once that's done click OK
07:42 - click OK and since you've changed
07:45 - something you're going to click apply
07:47 - and ok and that is all for downloading
07:50 - and installing CUDA and C UDN owners
07:53 - whatever
07:54 - name is okay the next step for us is to
07:56 - download and install anaconda now this
07:59 - is a Python distribution which allows us
08:02 - to set up virtual environments so that
08:04 - we can run tensorflow now tensorflow
08:06 - currently is only supported on python
08:08 - 3.5 or 3.6 I believe so for this video
08:11 - we're going to be working in Python 3.5
08:13 - it really doesn't matter as long as you
08:15 - have a version greater than 3 there's
08:18 - not really a huge difference in Python
08:19 - Justino so you can download any version
08:21 - of anaconda that you want but when we
08:24 - set up the virtual environment we're
08:25 - gonna use 3.5 so download and install
08:27 - anaconda I already have it downloaded
08:29 - here 3.7 version is fine and then open
08:32 - it up run it and run through the
08:35 - installation process now I already have
08:37 - it installed so I'm not going to go
08:39 - through this but just notice that
08:40 - actually let's go through it quickly
08:42 - just me let's see I see it's already
08:48 - there so it's not gonna let me do that
08:49 - but pretty much what you guys need to
08:51 - make sure that you click when you're
08:52 - installing that is
08:53 - anaconda - path it's going to give you
08:56 - like some red text and say are you sure
08:57 - you want to do this just click yes make
08:59 - sure that you add anaconda to your path
09:02 - okay make sure that you do that
09:04 - otherwise these next steps are not going
09:06 - to work for you okay so now I'm assuming
09:08 - you have anaconda installed you have
09:10 - CUDA installed you have Visual Studio
09:11 - installed and before that you
09:13 - uninstalled all Nvidia drivers if you're
09:16 - caught up with me we're gonna move to
09:17 - the next step and this is the easier
09:19 - stuff so we're just going to run our
09:20 - command prompt and pop it up like this
09:23 - and we're simply just gonna type Conda
09:25 - to test that everything is working now
09:27 - once you test this if you don't get any
09:29 - error messages you've successfully
09:30 - completed the beginning part of the
09:33 - Tauri tutorial at least so far so you
09:35 - can continue on what we're gonna do now
09:37 - is we're gonna set up a new virtual
09:38 - environment and get ready to install
09:41 - tensorflow
09:42 - into that environment because up until
09:43 - now we haven't even installed tensorflow
09:45 - so we're gonna type Conda - and and then
09:48 - we're gonna give it a name so you can
09:50 - call yours tensorflow
09:52 - I would recommend I already have a
09:53 - virtual environment called tensorflow so
09:55 - I'm just gonna call this tutorial okay
09:57 - and this is gonna be the name of the
09:59 - virtual environment that you're gonna
10:00 - use when you are using tensorflow so
10:04 - name it something that you're gonna
10:05 - remember okay and then you're gonna type
10:07 - python equals 3.5 now don't think you
10:11 - can put any number here if you put a
10:12 - number greater than 3.5 i will not
10:14 - guarantee that this is gonna work for
10:16 - you as tension flow is only supported on
10:17 - certain versions of Python as of today
10:20 - when you've done that click enter no
10:24 - what's it Conda and no command Conda
10:28 - tutorial ah sorry I need to add creat my
10:32 - bad Conda creates - add tutorial and
10:38 - then python equals 3.5 my apologies
10:42 - about that okay so once you've done that
10:44 - it should start saying solving
10:45 - environment and everything should start
10:47 - working now once this is done it's going
10:49 - to go through installing a bunch of
10:50 - stuff you're just gonna continued and
10:52 - click yes and wait for this to finish
10:55 - okay so now that everything is
10:57 - downloaded and installed we need to
10:59 - activate the virtual environment so this
11:02 - is what you're gonna do anytime you want
11:04 - to install a new package into a virtual
11:06 - environment
11:07 - you first have to activate that
11:09 - environment especially if you're using
11:10 - anaconda okay we're going to type
11:12 - activate and then the name of our
11:14 - environment so whatever you named your
11:16 - environment in this case I named mine
11:17 - tutorial okay so we activate tutorial it
11:21 - should give you the little brackets like
11:22 - this and that's how you know that
11:23 - everything is working now what we're
11:25 - going to do is we're going to install
11:27 - tensorflow
11:28 - so to do this we're something going to
11:31 - type the pip install - - and then ignore
11:35 - and then - installed - - upgrade and
11:41 - then tensor flow gee pete you like that
11:46 - okay it that it's going to run through
11:50 - an installation process that will most
11:51 - likely take a few minutes and once
11:53 - that's finished we can move on to the
11:55 - next step okay so now that we have
11:59 - finished installing tensorflow within
12:01 - our package or sorry within our virtual
12:03 - environment there are a few other
12:04 - packages we need to install now I
12:07 - recommend that you should install all
12:08 - the packages you think you're gonna use
12:10 - right now just to save you some time so
12:12 - you don't have to go back and reinstall
12:14 - packages but one that you're definitely
12:15 - gonna want to please pip install and
12:17 - then care us okay so go ahead click that
12:20 - and you should run through this and same
12:23 - thing wait for this to finish and then
12:25 - we're gonna install one more package
12:26 - okay so now that care is is installed
12:29 - you have the option to elsewh install
12:31 - the packages I'm going to type that so
12:32 - I'm just going to say sorry import pip
12:35 - install and then I would recommend you
12:37 - install pandas because you're probably
12:40 - gonna have to use that when you're
12:41 - reading in data and creating data frames
12:43 - especially if you're using any machine
12:44 - learning stuff which I assume is why
12:46 - you're installing tensorflow GPU version
12:48 - I would also recommend you install numpy
12:50 - I'm not sure if it automatically comes
12:51 - with tensorflow but if it doesn't you
12:54 - should install that while we are already
12:56 - in the installation process now that
12:59 - this is finished I will show you what to
13:02 - do if you wanted to get back into your
13:04 - Condit environment to install stuff say
13:06 - you forgot ru there's another package
13:07 - you want you could just go here to your
13:10 - command prompt and simply type activate
13:14 - and then the name of your virtual
13:16 - environment
13:17 - we'll activate your environment and you
13:19 - can now go and install all your things
13:21 - so if I just type Python in here you can
13:23 - see it says Python three point five
13:25 - point six we get anaconda and I can test
13:27 - out to see if everything is working by
13:29 - importing tensorflow and you can see
13:31 - that we haven't received any error
13:33 - messages yet it should actually go to
13:35 - the next line yes there we go so
13:36 - importing tensorflow was successful and
13:39 - that's how you know that you have
13:40 - officially installed tensorflow
13:41 - into the in virtual environment now
13:43 - that's all you need to do when you know
13:45 - how to work with tensorflow feel free to
13:47 - click off the video but if you want a
13:48 - quick tutorial on how to actually use
13:50 - this virtual environment I suggest you
13:53 - follow along now what I'm going to do is
13:55 - I'm going to open up PI charm which is
13:57 - the IDE that I like to use I know this
13:59 - is not the best for data science but I'm
14:01 - going to show you how you can actually
14:02 - use your virtual environment and where
14:04 - to find it and this will work in other
14:06 - editors as well so I'm just gonna create
14:08 - a new project and I don't know let's
14:10 - just call it yeah untitled is fine for
14:12 - right now now where it says project
14:14 - interpreter you're going to want to
14:16 - change this to an existing interpreter
14:18 - now you can see that I already have a
14:20 - virtual environment called web scrape
14:22 - but I'm just gonna set up a new one
14:23 - so click existing interpreter click this
14:27 - dot dot dot and then go to kondeh
14:29 - environment again click this dot dot dot
14:32 - and you're going to find your conda
14:34 - environment now your Kannada environment
14:36 - should be in your c drive users your
14:39 - user name and there should be a anaconda
14:42 - folder like this so this is going to be
14:44 - wherever you installed your ant Conda
14:45 - now within here there's gonna be
14:48 - something called env s okay
14:49 - inside env is you're gonna have your
14:52 - virtual environment so you can see that
14:54 - I have four new web tensorflow tutorial
14:56 - and web scrape you will have one if you
14:58 - haven't made a second one
15:00 - open up your desired virtual environment
15:03 - like this and then find the file that
15:05 - says python w exe so click on that one
15:09 - and this is going to be the one that you
15:10 - select you click OK now this is going to
15:14 - be your project interpreter and this is
15:16 - how it works with pygame now if you'd
15:18 - like this to be available to all
15:19 - projects you could say make available to
15:21 - all projects other than that just go
15:23 - ahead and click OK and you've now
15:25 - officially you can see that we have
15:27 - Python 3.5 and it is the tutorial
15:31 - virtual environment which means now that
15:33 - tensorflow and all the packages you
15:35 - installed within there are gonna be in
15:37 - this interpreter so you could go ahead
15:39 - and click create if you're using pi tram
15:40 - and then if we want to test this out i
15:43 - can create a new python file really
15:45 - quickly I just call it del and then I
15:48 - could simply import tensorflow
15:51 - well it's gonna take a second to scan
15:53 - the packages but once that's done we'll
15:54 - import tensorflow
15:55 - okay let's see tensorflow and if you
15:59 - don't get any errors on that import
16:01 - statement and everything looks fine you
16:03 - are working and you are good so that is
16:07 - pretty much been it on how to install
16:09 - tensor flow GPU you guys have any
16:11 - questions or something's not working
16:12 - leave a comment down below if you got
16:15 - lost in this tutorial and any errors
16:17 - popped up I recommend you restart the
16:18 - process watch the video again and really
16:21 - make sure you're following everything
16:22 - again all the links to everything that I
16:24 - do are in the description down below and
16:25 - if this helped you out I would really
16:26 - appreciate a like and consider
