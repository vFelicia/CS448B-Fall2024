00:00 - hey guys welcome back to another video
00:02 - in today's video I'm going to be talking
00:04 - about overclocking a graphics card um so
00:08 - for those of you that don't know
00:09 - overclocking is pretty much just
00:11 - changing the settings on your graphics
00:13 - card to enhance performance and to get
00:15 - the most out of your Hardware um by
00:18 - default your graphics cards are sent to
00:20 - you at stock performance meaning that
00:22 - they're not at 100% and that they're
00:24 - running at about 60 or 65% of what their
00:27 - top performance could be so what we're
00:29 - going to do today is we're going to play
00:31 - around with a few settings on our
00:32 - graphics cards and really see if we can
00:34 - get it up to 100% and uh working at its
00:37 - full potential um so the first thing we
00:40 - need to do if we're going to overclock
00:42 - our graphics card is we have to download
00:44 - a certain software um now this software
00:46 - is actually made by um the Nvidia
00:49 - graphics card company so it's completely
00:51 - safe to use um and it's called MSI After
00:54 - Burner so what we're going to do is
00:56 - we're just going to head over to the
00:57 - website up here MSI msi.com
01:00 - /page afterburner and I'll link that
01:02 - down below you're going to find the
01:04 - downloads tab right here we're going to
01:05 - click downloads and then all we're going
01:07 - to do is simply click on download After
01:10 - Burner so we'll do that wait for it to
01:15 - download and there we go so we'll just
01:17 - click on that and all we have to do is
01:19 - double click on
01:21 - thise file here to run the installation
01:24 - wizard so we'll just wait a second for
01:25 - this to pop up
01:28 - um yeah give me a second all right there
01:30 - we go we're just going to click yes
01:31 - allow it to make
01:33 - changes and then simply go through the
01:36 - installation process so we go to the
01:38 - afterburner setup Wizard and then we
01:40 - accept and continue through here now
01:43 - I've actually already installed this on
01:45 - my computer so I'm not going to do this
01:47 - um but go ahead you don't need this Riva
01:49 - tuner statistics server you don't have
01:51 - to check that if you want to you can uh
01:54 - download it but it's not necessary okay
01:56 - so once you've downloaded that what
01:59 - we're going to do now is we're going to
02:00 - open up the program so I've got mine on
02:02 - my desktop here I'm just going to double
02:03 - click it and again just
02:07 - accept and we'll wait a second and you
02:09 - see we have this MSI afterburner um that
02:13 - pops up now yours might look a little
02:14 - bit different depending on what version
02:16 - you've got um but it's all very similar
02:19 - okay so you may see your sliders are
02:21 - going to be set to different settings
02:24 - based on what your graphics card is um
02:27 - but I'll go through what each of these
02:28 - are going to do so the first thing we
02:29 - want to if we're going to overclock our
02:30 - graphics card is we have to set the
02:32 - power limit to 100% this is going to
02:35 - allow us to draw in the most electricity
02:38 - um so that we can do the most with our
02:40 - card so I have set mine up to 100 here
02:43 - um and now the temperature limits so
02:45 - this is completely dependent on what
02:47 - type of graphics card you have for me I
02:49 - feel comfortable uh letting mine run up
02:51 - to 83 although graphics cards are able
02:54 - to usually run about 105 as the hottest
02:57 - um temperature you don't want to run
02:58 - that for very long but if it's running
03:00 - for a little bit when it's starting up a
03:02 - program or something that's fine so I'm
03:03 - just going to leave my temperature limit
03:04 - here at 83 you could feel three feel
03:06 - free to uh move that up if you would
03:09 - like okay now the core clock so a lot of
03:13 - people think if you want to run your
03:14 - graphics card like a lot faster you're
03:16 - going to have to bump this core clock up
03:18 - a ton that is absolutely not true the
03:21 - core clock you can see I've already have
03:23 - mine overclocked here at plus
03:25 - 122 um that's different than the factory
03:28 - default which would be plus zero
03:30 - obviously um so you see I've only bumped
03:33 - mine up a tiny bit um so depending on
03:36 - what graphics card you have you can just
03:37 - put it up a little bit and it is going
03:39 - to give a drastic difference so don't
03:42 - you don't have to throw your slider all
03:44 - the way up here to a th000 at the Max uh
03:46 - as you can see I only did mine at about
03:48 - what 150 or something like that so I'll
03:49 - leave that there um now the memory clock
03:52 - this one you can push a little bit
03:53 - further um for my GPU it's recommended
03:56 - to only go up to 550 so I'm going to
03:58 - leave it at 488 like this and yeah now
04:03 - the fan setting um you just want to
04:05 - leave this on auto you can set it
04:07 - manually if you'd like but Auto is
04:09 - probably the best thing so that it's
04:10 - automatically going to adjust depending
04:12 - on how fast um and how much your
04:14 - graphics card is really doing so once
04:16 - you're done go ahead and click the check
04:18 - mark and there you go you saved your
04:20 - settings and now in this program you're
04:22 - able to actually monitor um the
04:24 - temperature and the speed that your
04:26 - graphics card is running at so if you
04:28 - want to test um how fast it's going to
04:31 - run and how hot it's going to get you
04:32 - can go ahead and run a game so if you
04:34 - have some graphics intensive games and
04:38 - yeah okay so the thing you're going to
04:40 - want to watch out for when you're
04:42 - testing your graphics card is right here
04:45 - the temperature um now the biggest
04:47 - killer of graphics cards and if you hear
04:49 - of people blowing up their graphics
04:51 - cards it's because of the temperature so
04:54 - really that's why I've set my
04:55 - temperature limit to 83 um because
04:58 - anything past that running at a long
05:00 - period of times can be dangerous to your
05:03 - graphics card so if you notice that when
05:05 - you're running a game you've got your
05:07 - core clock all the way up your memory
05:08 - clock all the way up and your
05:09 - temperature is running really high like
05:11 - past 90Â° C you're going to want to tweak
05:13 - it so that your temperature doesn't run
05:15 - as High um that's the biggest difficulty
05:19 - with uh overclocking is you really want
05:20 - to watch the temperature and you may
05:22 - notice that by simply putting your core
05:24 - clock down maybe even 10 MHz um or up a
05:28 - little bit the temperature could change
05:29 - drastically so really watch that um yeah
05:33 - and then other than that you really just
05:34 - have to play around with your card and
05:36 - figure out which settings are going to
05:37 - give you the best ones for example my
05:39 - card here I'm using a GeForce 1050 TI uh
05:43 - it's a mini 4 GB of dedicated video
05:46 - memory um I don't want to push it too
05:48 - hard because it's not a very expensive
05:50 - graphics card it's about $180 so it's
05:52 - not a super high-end one um and you can
05:55 - see down here it says what the graphics
05:56 - card is and the driver version so I'm
05:58 - just going to leave it at this this for
05:59 - my overclocking but with yours you may
06:01 - want to tweak it move it up and down a
06:03 - little bit and see how much more
06:04 - performance you can get out of it um so
06:07 - yeah really overclocking um it is
06:11 - slightly dangerous depending on how far
06:12 - you're going to move these sliders but
06:14 - by just tweaking them a little bit and
06:16 - moving them up a bit and continuously
06:17 - testing and watching the temperature
06:19 - you're not going to do any damage to
06:20 - your card and you're not going to affect
06:22 - any of the components in your computer
06:25 - um so that's been a basic tutorial on
06:27 - how to overclock your graphics card um
06:30 - if you want a more advanced tutorial
06:32 - really talking about um more
06:34 - overclocking let me know in the comments
