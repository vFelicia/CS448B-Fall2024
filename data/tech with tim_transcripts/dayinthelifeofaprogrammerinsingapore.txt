00:00 - 30 hours from now I'm going to be in
00:01 - Singapore for something pretty exciting
00:04 - I've got three flights starting here in
00:06 - Halifax Nova Scotia this is definitely
00:08 - something different but welcome to
00:10 - travel with
00:10 - [Music]
00:28 - TP
00:31 - few hours later and we are on the ground
00:33 - in beautiful Singapore and on our way to
00:35 - the hotel where I'll be able to sleep in
00:37 - a proper bed for the first time in
00:39 - nearly 2
00:41 - [Music]
00:57 - days all right guys I have arrived in
01:00 - the hotel after about 30 hours of travel
01:03 - that includes about 22 hours of flights
01:05 - and 8 hours of layovers I'm pretty tired
01:08 - but I need to do my job I'm going to
01:10 - show you guys the room and give you a
01:12 - bit of information about what I'm
01:14 - actually doing here in Singapore all
01:16 - right so let's do a little bit of a tour
01:18 - here now keep in mind I'm not a travel
01:20 - vlogger so bear with me here guys
01:25 - nothing crazy but I'm staying at the JW
01:28 - Marriott Singapore South Beach if any of
01:31 - you know what that actually is just it's
01:34 - a hotel room but they've got all the
01:35 - amenities and everything and there you
01:37 - go that's where I'm going to be staying
01:38 - for the next 4 days while I tour around
01:40 - Singapore I'm going to try to make this
01:41 - as fun and exciting as possible and kind
01:44 - of share with you guys what I'm doing in
01:45 - Singapore here during my first
01:48 - [Music]
01:58 - time all right guys I'm out here in the
02:02 - hotel just going to look for some food
02:04 - it is very freaking
02:07 - [Music]
02:15 - hot now I'm going to roll some clips of
02:17 - me in Singapore while I share with you
02:19 - why I'm actually here so I teamed up
02:22 - with a company called Oppo which is a
02:24 - massive smartphone brand and tech
02:25 - company in Asia they actually flew me
02:27 - here paid for my trip Etc to cover two
02:30 - events the first event is the
02:32 - inspiration Challenge and then the
02:34 - launch of their new flip and fold phones
02:36 - now I actually live streamed the
02:38 - inspiration challenge which you can
02:39 - watch on my channel where Oppo brought
02:41 - the top 15 teams from their Global
02:44 - competition to compete to win grant
02:46 - money and collaboration opportunities
02:48 - with Oppo think of this as kind of a
02:50 - hackathon but for startup companies that
02:52 - have a bit more traction now as an
02:54 - example you can actually see a cool demo
02:57 - that I did with one of the companies
02:58 - that was competing now it's a a bit
03:00 - difficult to understand what's happening
03:01 - here but this is a new technology called
03:03 - yr that allows data to be transmitted
03:06 - with very low energy and even through
03:08 - the human body when I touch the phone
03:10 - here I can actually hear the music in my
03:12 - ear it's pretty
03:14 - [Music]
03:28 - cool
03:31 - so after spending a day in Singapore it
03:33 - was time to live stream the Oppo
03:35 - inspiration challenge now as I mentioned
03:37 - this was essentially the final demo
03:39 - event for the top 15 teams of a total of
03:42 - over 600 applicants now I got there
03:45 - early and I checked out the demo area
03:47 - where all of the teams had their
03:48 - products set up all these teams were
03:50 - making something that was designed to
03:52 - help the planet or to help people and to
03:54 - ultimately align with oppo's technology
03:57 - for mankind kindness for the world and
03:59 - inspiration ahead Vision now one of the
04:02 - coolest projects I looked at was called
04:04 - orbit which was designed as a nextg 3D
04:07 - sensor tracking system that could be
04:09 - used more reliably and affordably than
04:11 - current technology mostly in dental
04:13 - medical Etc now another notable one was
04:16 - woa now this used what would normally be
04:18 - disposed of sheep wool to create a
04:20 - sustainable packaging solution that
04:22 - could replace bubble wrap it was also a
04:25 - really cool project that used AI to
04:27 - create a better haptic experience that
04:29 - allowed you to have a more immersive
04:30 - gaming and video viewing experience I
04:33 - tried that one out myself and it was
04:34 - really really cool overall a really cool
04:37 - and inspiring event and if you want to
04:38 - check out all of the projects you can
04:40 - view the live stream on my channel where
04:42 - I actually showed you that entire event
04:44 - where the teams went through all of
04:45 - their
04:46 - presentations all right guys I'm here at
04:49 - the new phone launch for Oppo it's very
04:52 - very dark and very very loud in the main
04:54 - area so I've just gone over here I'm
04:56 - going to show you guys the new phone and
04:57 - all the stuff at the event stay tuned
05:00 - now the next day it was time for oppo's
05:03 - launch event of their new find N3 series
05:05 - there were two phones they were
05:07 - launching their new flip and their new
05:09 - fold phone now the presentation was
05:11 - about 2 hours long and they shared all
05:13 - kinds of impressive specs and details
05:15 - with the design and the performance of
05:16 - these phones up until now I'd never even
05:19 - thought about using a foldable or
05:20 - flippable phone but honestly after the
05:23 - presentation I was pretty much sold too
05:25 - bad they were also sold out of phones
05:27 - overall I was really impressed by the
05:29 - design of the phones and the fact that
05:30 - there was virtually no seam or kind of
05:33 - crease in them when you fold it over and
05:35 - even with the massive screens they were
05:37 - quite light and thin now Kaka the famous
05:39 - soccer player had a similar opinion hey
05:42 - guys I'm here with the new Oppo Find N3
05:45 - this thing is kind of crazy to be honest
05:47 - with you look at like how it folds here
05:49 - it's got three screens these kind of
05:52 - insane cameras this has been such a cool
05:55 - phone to have a look at and even the
05:57 - fact I can hold it like this mess around
05:59 - with it like really really unique if I
06:02 - could put in my pocket super super
06:05 - thin actually really impressive you make
06:08 - it this thin I'm not sure if you guys
06:11 - can see like it's almost the same
06:13 - thickness as a normal phone and it folds
06:15 - out here and you have this huge huge
06:17 - display and then if you don't want that
06:19 - you just have the normal display like
06:21 - this that fits in my hand really really
06:22 - nicely I don't have very big hands it
06:25 - fits really nice so guys I'm here with
06:26 - the flip version of the phone you see
06:29 - flips down and you can hold it like this
06:31 - again pretty thin put it in my pocket
06:35 - very small it has this cool vertical
06:39 - display got it upside down here you can
06:41 - take photos on it it's got all these
06:43 - avatars and then if I want I just flip
06:46 - it up into the normal phone like this I
06:49 - like this one as well a bit more
06:50 - practical if you have smaller Pockets
06:52 - especially like back pocket really
06:56 - easily yeah cool phone overall so
07:00 - overall that's pretty much it I want to
07:02 - give a massive thank you to Oppo for
07:03 - making this such a great experience for
07:05 - bringing me to Singapore introducing me
07:07 - to so many people and allowing me to
07:09 - attend this event not something that
07:11 - I've normally done before but it was a
07:13 - really cool experience and something I
07:15 - definitely look forward to doing again
07:16 - so if you guys enjoyed this make sure
