00:29 - e
03:29 - e
07:17 - I don't know if you guys can hear me I
07:18 - don't know if this is working I'm going
07:20 - to take a minute just to make sure that
07:21 - everything's working here obviously I
07:23 - don't stream very often the last time I
07:24 - streamed was probably like a year and a
07:26 - half ago so I apologized that there was
07:28 - like 17 streams going on with like some
07:30 - working some not working some people
07:32 - there some people here anyways we are
07:34 - starting I'm just going to make sure you
07:36 - guys can hear me yeah okay let me know
07:38 - in the chat I think the latency is
07:39 - pretty good on this stream on the last
07:40 - ones I've done it's been like I would
07:42 - talk and then you guys would reply to me
07:43 - in like a minute okay I'm just reading
07:45 - the chat looks like we're all good no
07:47 - audio crisp and clear you're good you're
07:49 - good works okay sweet let me know in the
07:52 - chat guys keep uh keep me updated on
07:54 - what's going on here because a lot of
07:56 - the times I'm probably going to mess
07:57 - something up we've got 48 six people
08:00 - watching this is awesome um yeah thank
08:03 - you guys all for coming out this is
08:04 - going to be an awesome stream however
08:05 - long you guys can stay that's great
08:07 - obviously I'm going to be going for um
08:10 - what do you call it for 12 hours not
08:12 - audible um can't
08:15 - hear let's see the quality turn on
08:18 - slow-mo no sound H okay I'm getting an
08:21 - your audio stream is zero okay one sec
08:24 - guys it's really hard for me to tell if
08:26 - this is working or not suggestion the
08:28 - audio streams current bit rate is lower
08:30 - than
08:31 - recommended okay good no sound can hear
08:35 - perfectly well are you guys trolling me
08:37 - or not can you hear me I'm going to go
08:38 - on my phone and just and just make sure
08:40 - that it that it sounds good because I
08:41 - don't want to stream for 12 hours with
08:42 - bad sound
08:47 - okay oh guys I sound great stop trolling
08:50 - me okay if you guys troll me it's
08:51 - actually good I I don't want to tell you
08:52 - that but it might work because I don't
08:54 - stream very often anyways let me go
08:55 - through what's going on here first of
08:57 - all I need to thank the sponsor of the
08:58 - Stream it's algo expert you guys can see
09:00 - the little overlay that I have here you
09:02 - guys probably know algo expert you know
09:04 - that I work there it genuinely is in my
09:06 - opinion the best platform to use to
09:08 - prepare for software engineering coding
09:09 - interviews they've got about 155 coding
09:12 - interview questions data structures
09:14 - crash course a ton of other just awesome
09:16 - features on the platform to help you
09:18 - guys prepare and land a job in the
09:19 - software engineering industry obviously
09:21 - you can check them out from the link in
09:22 - the description and then you can use the
09:24 - code Tech with him for 10% off with that
09:27 - said I would really like to keep looking
09:28 - at the chat we've got 661 people thank
09:30 - you everyone for tuning in but oh and
09:33 - look my thing is working the donation
09:35 - thing is working this is great this is
09:36 - good news thank you for the the Super
09:38 - Chat uh let me just Shout at the name
09:41 - here gaming with Gant via uh yeah I'm
09:44 - not going to be able to pronounce that
09:45 - here you go Tim appreciate that though
09:47 - okay what we're going to be building
09:48 - here is a clone of the popular website
09:51 - type eraser now I know I've called it
09:53 - typing eraser just cuz I think that's a
09:54 - better name uh but let's go to typing
09:56 - eraser here and I'll show you guys what
09:58 - I'm going to be building so if you go to
10:01 - race um let's go to practice yourself
10:04 - you can see that it shows you like a
10:06 - block of text it has like you know the
10:08 - lights or whatever and then like you go
10:09 - and you are typing and racing against
10:11 - someone else so right now I'm doing this
10:13 - just like single player but usually
10:14 - there'll be a bunch of people that
10:16 - you're racing against so I want to make
10:18 - the same thing obviously the UI won't be
10:20 - as complex as this but I want to make it
10:22 - code racer so I want to have a block of
10:25 - code show up on the screen and then like
10:27 - we'll probably do head-to-head so two
10:28 - people two people will race to type out
10:31 - that exact block of code like
10:33 - indentation and everything now I'm not
10:35 - going to be able to do it as well as
10:36 - this because uh since it's coding like
10:39 - the way you code is you can't you skip
10:41 - characters all the time right like when
10:42 - I'm coding if I go here and I go to I
10:46 - don't know let's just go to some some
10:47 - file here go to app. TSX okay if I go
10:52 - inside of here when I'm coding if I do
10:54 - parentheses right like I'm always going
10:55 - to type like this like this is how I
10:57 - type and so if we make it so that you
10:59 - have to not skip a character like you
11:02 - have to type each character perfectly
11:03 - that's going to be a problem for most
11:05 - people when they're coding so it won't
11:06 - be as nice as that uh but that is what
11:08 - I'm going to try to do okay 752 people
11:10 - wow this is awesome um Tim common you
11:13 - can do this in seven hours no need to go
11:15 - all the way to 12 yeah okay and so I am
11:17 - going for 12 hours if you guys follow
11:19 - this channel if you've been subscribers
11:20 - before uh then you would know that I've
11:22 - done a few of these streams the first
11:24 - stream I ever did it was 18 hours long I
11:27 - wanted to go for 24 but my body just
11:29 - genuinely couldn't handle it like I got
11:31 - to 18 hours and I was just sitting there
11:32 - like I couldn't do anything like I was
11:34 - just stupid essentially after 18 hours
11:37 - uh and then I did a 12-hour stream that
11:39 - one went really well I did another
11:40 - 12-hour stream and now I'm doing a final
11:43 - 12-hour stream previously I'd done like
11:44 - a 4our stream or 4 and a half hour
11:46 - stream uh but yeah this is tough uh for
11:49 - the first few hours I'm probably going
11:50 - to be moving relatively quickly and then
11:52 - as soon as it hits probably hour five 6
11:55 - maybe 7 uh you're going to start to
11:57 - notice that I am just not as intelligent
11:59 - as I was before and my coding
12:00 - productivity is going to drastically
12:02 - decrease so I want to get started I'm
12:04 - going to get started in 1 second but I
12:05 - want to walk through kind of the stack
12:07 - just really run through the idea what
12:09 - I'm going to start building so you guys
12:10 - have an idea of what I'm doing uh you
12:12 - guys are asking a ton of questions I'm
12:13 - trying to keep up with chat um na uh
12:16 - Navy Anish uh technical Point best of
12:19 - luck for the project donated 40 uh
12:21 - whatever the Indian currency is I don't
12:23 - know what that's called is rupes the
12:24 - correct one I I might be wrong in that
12:26 - anyways thank you for the donation
12:27 - appreciate that uh um no music can you
12:31 - guys not hear any music I think there's
12:32 - music isn't there let me know if you
12:35 - guys can hear the music or not because I
12:36 - do have music
12:39 - playing can you guys hear it music type
12:41 - in the chat music if you can hear the
12:43 - music or if it's too loud or if it's too
12:46 - quiet I can they're trolling yeah guys
12:49 - this is so hard when I'm streaming cuz
12:50 - half of you are trolling half of you
12:52 - aren't trolling and the people trolling
12:53 - are like spamming more so it's really
12:55 - hard to determine uh if the music is is
12:58 - on or not if you guys want to check out
13:00 - who uh who made the music is actually a
13:01 - friend of mine it's uh Linked In the
13:03 - description you guys are saying it's
13:05 - it's too quiet okay I think the next
13:06 - song's cominging on right now anyways
13:08 - we'll we'll deal with that later uh bad
13:10 - music music so the thing is I have to
13:12 - use copyright free music I don't trust
13:15 - using any music other than music I know
13:17 - someone who made it from so the person
13:19 - who made this music is like a close
13:20 - friend of mine and I know he's not going
13:22 - to copyright strike me so that's why I'm
13:23 - using it it's just to have something in
13:24 - the background um now it's audible slow
13:28 - mode how do I turn on slow mode is there
13:30 - a way to do that I genuinely don't know
13:32 - how to turn on slow
13:34 - mode is it like that does that do
13:36 - anything no okay I guess that doesn't do
13:38 - anything
13:40 - um is there music music music okay great
13:44 - you know what let's get started I'm
13:46 - going to walk through kind of the stack
13:48 - I'm going to be using here I've set up a
13:49 - little bit of stuff but it's not like
13:51 - fully functioning I still have to go
13:52 - through the rest of the setup so what
13:54 - I'm going to be using here is react
13:57 - flask typescript and then a bunch of
13:59 - other like libraries through npm that
14:02 - are going to help me do stuff like
14:03 - authentication um what else sockets all
14:07 - that kind of stuff so react obviously
14:09 - will be the front end I want to use
14:10 - typescript just cuz I haven't I actually
14:12 - haven't like written in typescript for
14:14 - about a year and I think it would be fun
14:16 - to use typescript and I think it's just
14:17 - better for like a large project like
14:19 - this and then flask for the back end cuz
14:22 - I don't really need a ton of stuff on
14:23 - the back and it's going to be a super
14:24 - simple database and all the database is
14:26 - going to be doing is storing like login
14:28 - authentic credentials and then some
14:31 - stuff related to like users typing speed
14:33 - like that's all I really need for the
14:34 - back end there's not a ton of data
14:35 - involved in this application the most
14:37 - complicated part is going to be how do I
14:39 - send live uh the progress of two
14:42 - people's kind of typing on this code and
14:44 - then actually validate like who's typed
14:46 - the code properly what percentage of the
14:47 - code they've typed and then calculate
14:49 - their wpm so words per minute um live
14:52 - that's going to be the hardest part um
14:54 - please no music we can provide our own
14:56 - and get rid of spammers I'll turn the
14:58 - music down I I do like music just for
15:00 - myself so I'm going to have a little bit
15:01 - of music on um but yeah if you guys
15:03 - think it's too loud or whatever let me
15:05 - know lower the music
15:08 - okay make make music louder lower the
15:10 - music okay I have music on uh I think
15:13 - it's probably quiet enough now good good
15:16 - music good what do you guys think music
15:19 - too loud it should be good
15:23 - now now good now good okay remember this
15:27 - level it's at negative 32 DB music is
15:30 - perfect I know I should get a haircut
15:32 - guys oh my God I want to get a haircut
15:34 - so badly I literally cannot legally get
15:36 - a haircut in Ontario right now and I
15:38 - won't be able to legally get a haircut
15:40 - in Ontario for the next like 3 weeks so
15:42 - this is going to be this is the longest
15:44 - my hair has ever been and it's going to
15:45 - keep getting longer okay nice perfect
15:47 - can you please say Okay wear
15:50 - headphones guys chill can you put -28 DB
15:54 - it's on -30 DB right now your hair looks
15:57 - good thank you appreciate it go enable
15:59 - slow mode guys I don't know how to
16:01 - enable slow mode I want to I want to
16:03 - enable slow mode but I don't know how to
16:04 - do it um how do you do this okay let me
16:08 - let me just look that up quickly before
16:10 - we get started I want to get all this
16:11 - setup done how to enable slow mode
16:16 - YouTube
16:19 - um toggle on slow mode there there's I
16:22 - don't see anything that says slow mode
16:25 - maybe I'm just settings let's see maybe
16:29 - have to do it through actual YouTube not
16:31 - uh
16:33 - OBS um it will it will be on streamlabs
16:37 - is it on
16:39 - streamlabs uh schedule stream start
16:42 - no guys if someone sends me like a photo
16:45 - of where to do it then I can do it
16:52 - um okay uh yeah this should help oh did
16:56 - the nightbot do slow mode for us
16:59 - alt f4 yeah okay guys I'm not I'm not
17:02 - going to get trolled that hard I uh I do
17:03 - know that okay awesome so let's let's
17:06 - get started where I'm going to try to
17:08 - set this up there's like a bunch of
17:09 - setup I still need to do I should have
17:10 - done this before but it's fine so I have
17:12 - like a python API file or folder here
17:15 - this is where all my flask stuff going
17:17 - to be I have like some basic setup here
17:19 - but I need to configure the database and
17:21 - then what else do I have here um
17:23 - obviously all of the stuff related to
17:25 - react so I have like my SRC folder here
17:27 - with all this typescript stuff I'm going
17:29 - to start just cleaning this up actually
17:30 - right now and removing all this crap
17:32 - that I don't need there's actually a lot
17:33 - of it uh references I probably need that
17:36 - I don't I don't know if I need that
17:37 - actually okay let's delete that let's
17:41 - delete
17:43 - that great oh and in terms of the no
17:45 - breaks thing I will like go to the
17:47 - washroom obviously and I'm going to go
17:48 - like get food and bring it back here but
17:49 - the stream's not going to end like I
17:51 - will be live for 12 hours and like the
17:52 - longest I'm going to be away from this
17:55 - uh computer is probably like a few
17:57 - minutes um so that's kind of what I mean
17:58 - when I say no breaks although like if
18:00 - I'm like just absolutely exhausted I
18:02 - will uh what do you call it take like a
18:04 - short break in terms of like um I'll
18:07 - I'll play like a video game maybe or
18:08 - something I don't know we'll we'll see
18:09 - uh it'll only be a few minutes long okay
18:11 - index. TSX react okay I think that's
18:15 - good also just to note I I forgot how
18:17 - hard it is to focus when the uh the chat
18:20 - is going because like I'm trying to code
18:22 - right now just very very lightly just
18:23 - deleting stuff and while I'm trying to
18:25 - talk and read the like millions of
18:27 - messages that are coming in uh it's it's
18:29 - actually really difficult so big uh what
18:32 - is it appreciation to people who do this
18:34 - like all day okay so the first thing I
18:35 - need to do here is I need to enable a
18:38 - proxy for my react application so that
18:40 - any of the routes that you try to go to
18:43 - if they're not actually like react rout
18:45 - uh will be forwarded to my API so I
18:47 - forget how to do that so we're just
18:48 - going to look that up uh I'm thinking
18:50 - it's probably smart to go in incognito
18:52 - mode while while I do all of this okay
18:54 - so let's uh look up how I'll say Pro
18:58 - proxy react okay proxying API request
19:02 - that's exactly what I want okay
19:06 - proxy and I believe I add that in
19:09 - package.json perfect okay easy so do
19:12 - that down here proxy who remembers what
19:15 - the port is for flas development server
19:17 - it's either 8,000 or
19:19 - 5,000 uh we can see this pretty easy CD
19:23 - into code
19:25 - racer and let's go python run
19:29 - API uh starting on 5,000 okay so Local
19:33 - Host 5,000 that should be good let me
19:35 - end that let me just add a script in
19:38 - here it says um
19:42 - API oops that needs to be a comma and
19:45 - we'll say
19:47 - Python and then runor api. piy great
19:52 - okay let's see what everyone's saying
19:54 - here um is the latency low Tim yeah the
19:57 - latency is hey Tim your screen is not
19:59 - clear can you guys not see the screen is
20:00 - it blurry or something um but let's see
20:04 - are you guys on high
20:06 - resolution I have two of these things
20:10 - open uh if you're using react you can
20:12 - remove the import react
20:15 - okay it's blurry clear
20:18 - no clear it's fine it's fine it's fine
20:21 - screen is a little blurry screen is good
20:23 - screen's good yeah let guys obviously
20:25 - let me know perfect screen it's fully
20:26 - clear okay great perfect
20:29 - I guess people wouldn't be trolling by
20:30 - telling me that it looks good okay let's
20:33 - continue um TS config see I haven't used
20:38 - typescript in so long so I genuinely
20:39 - forget like how it works um so this this
20:43 - stream is going to be a lot of me just
20:44 - figuring stuff out I have no idea how to
20:47 - do what I'm about to do here uh but the
20:49 - first thing I do want to do is just get
20:50 - this server running and just make sure
20:52 - everything's working so let's just yarn
20:53 - start here uh and let's see if we we get
20:55 - a crash or something or if this is going
20:57 - to be good okay yarn start and then in a
21:01 - new terminal window here I'm going to
21:03 - say CD into code racer and then yarn
21:09 - API okay let's get our server here can't
21:13 - resolve logo SVG okay let's wait what
21:16 - file was that in that is in app. TSX
21:20 - okay remove
21:22 - that excuse me uh we can remove yeah I
21:26 - don't need all this crap get rid of all
21:27 - this
21:29 - okay so now save that should be good
21:33 - let's go here refresh perfect now let's
21:37 - go P
21:39 - tag and
21:41 - test if I can get a lowercase
21:46 - here okay perfect great all good uh
21:50 - enable slow mode you can remove the
21:52 - import react see I'm God I have a stack
21:54 - Overflow right beside me uh minus 10
21:57 - please still screen is a little blurry
21:59 - 10 AP for me is just fine you can remove
22:01 - import react stop spam uh want to see
22:04 - live progress yes you guys are going to
22:06 - see progress yeah Jango is overkill for
22:07 - this that's why I'm not using it um as a
22:11 - beginner will I pick anything up yeah
22:12 - definitely probably just the
22:15 - um what do you call it uh like the way
22:18 - in which I'm like writing the code like
22:20 - at least when I was a beginner I
22:21 - wouldn't write code very cleanly uh and
22:24 - you'll probably see here kind of like
22:25 - some of the Styles and ways that I write
22:27 - code okay I want to enable slow mode
22:31 - sorry guys I am uh I don't stream very
22:33 - often so this is like really new for me
22:34 - I just want to make sure that everything
22:36 - is is working before I go for 12 hours
22:38 - and look back at the recording after and
22:39 - be like damn it it's not working uh
22:41 - moderate live chat okay let's see what
22:45 - it's saying here subscribers only slow
22:48 - mode create a live stream click settings
22:50 - click live chat toggle on slow mode turn
22:53 - on in stream now go to your live
22:54 - dashboard click in the chat module click
22:57 - settings okay see I'm doing this and
23:00 - it's not I don't see like a settings
23:03 - page
23:05 - settings
23:07 - participants
23:10 - timestamps H okay go
23:16 - here stream Health viewer
23:19 - activity analytics
23:21 - merchandise is there anything else here
23:24 - okay
23:29 - stream
23:31 - settings guys I can't like this should
23:33 - be way easier to find I genuinely like
23:35 - cannot find the button for slow
23:40 - mode share add stream marker create
23:44 - highlight
23:46 - video okay you know what we're we're
23:48 - going to go without without uh without
23:50 - slow mode because I genuinely can't uh
23:52 - can't find it it says I should be able
23:54 - to do it while the stream's running but
23:56 - I just I can't seem to find it maybe I
23:58 - actually have to to go to the stream
23:59 - itself and not the uh the dashboard
24:01 - although I did try this already
24:05 - YouTube and yeah obviously I have two
24:08 - extra monitors that you guys can't see
24:09 - one on my right side one on my left side
24:11 - that's for that's for any of the uh the
24:13 - confidential stuff while I'm
24:14 - streaming although I guess like this
24:16 - isn't really confidential but just so I
24:18 - don't leak anything okay looks like the
24:21 - stream's working screen looks uh looks
24:23 - clear to me doesn't look very blurry
24:24 - that's that's good chat um toggle
24:32 - timestamps manage moderator hide
24:37 - chat yeah okay I mean until until I can
24:40 - figure that out we're just we're going
24:41 - to go without slow mode on okay so what
24:43 - I'm going to do now is start working on
24:44 - the back end a little bit actually uh
24:46 - and I'll create like a login form as
24:48 - well I also need to install material UI
24:50 - so I'm going to do that now
24:53 - npm install app material UI although I
24:57 - believe there's a certain version I need
24:58 - to use for typescript so let's find out
25:01 - what that is and yeah we should keep it
25:03 - in incognito mode okay uh typ
25:07 - script uh material
25:11 - youi okay let's
25:14 - see usage just give me the damn npm
25:17 - command in order for types work you have
25:19 - to at least have the following options
25:20 - enabled in TS
25:22 - config okay create react app with
25:26 - typescript okay and PM install mpm start
25:30 - do any of you know do I need to install
25:32 - like a special thing for material UI for
25:34 - typescript
25:36 - okay install material
25:38 - UI
25:40 - typescript uh material UI is this going
25:42 - to be the same app yeah it is the same
25:44 - app okay I'm just going to install it
25:45 - and see if it works mpm install at
25:48 - Material
25:51 - UI uh is that not what it is at Material
25:55 - UI obviously I haven't done this stuff
25:57 - in a while see here getting
25:59 - started install material UI I think it's
26:03 - just
26:04 - mpm install material hyphen
26:08 - UI uh oh no at it's okay I found it now
26:11 - at Material UI core that's what it
26:13 - is although that seems to be
26:19 - working materal UI slore at types at
26:24 - types that's the one okay someone's
26:25 - helping me in the chat here do you have
26:26 - anything on your channel for beginners
26:27 - to learn I have lots of stuff on my
26:29 - channel for beginners to learn okay so
26:32 - this is at Material
26:34 - ui/ core and then someone said that I
26:37 - need to do the at types that's what it
26:38 - was I forgot that's what's
26:49 - there okay sweet so once that installs
26:52 - then we should be good I can start
26:53 - building the login screen and then I can
26:55 - start doing the authentication for the
26:57 - API so I'm going to say at views do and
27:02 - then I guess this is root I'm going to
27:04 - say slash
27:05 - login uh methods equals
27:10 - get post Define
27:14 - login pass okay and this would be
27:18 - signore up

27:56 - think we need a post request for sign
27:57 - out please use functions uh yes I'm
28:00 - obviously I'm going to use functions
28:02 - damn material UI is like massive it has
28:04 - to install a ton of crap okay and
28:06 - deprecated why is all this stuff
28:07 - deprecated H
28:09 - interesting okay I think everything is
28:11 - working
28:14 - good you can do yarn ad instead is yarn
28:17 - ad better is it better to use yarn than
28:19 - it is to use um to use
28:21 - mpm you guys are copying the code yeah
28:24 - good luck trying to copy the code I'm
28:25 - not probably like going to be going like
28:27 - pretty fast to like a lot of stuff would
28:29 - you please code your walk-in clinic app
28:32 - live please says sujal something can't
28:35 - pronounce the last name thank you for
28:36 - the Super Chat no I'm not going to do
28:38 - that live I wouldn't code something out
28:40 - that I already have coded right uh you
28:42 - should be consistent yarn is better
28:44 - imagine using Create react app LOL yeah
28:46 - well I'm using Create react app because
28:48 - I'm definitely not a uh what do you call
28:50 - it expert here in in in web development
28:53 - okay so yarn API did that not work when
28:56 - I did that no okay that did work good
28:59 - and yarn start sweet so let's build a um
29:04 - actually let me fix this first I'm kind
29:06 - of all over the place right now I got to
29:07 - get into the flow of things here okay
29:09 - app. config
29:13 - DB
29:17 - nice from Models import this is going to
29:20 - be user excuse me let's go
29:31 - create database
29:34 - nice okay so now I have to figure out
29:38 - what I want to do why is this not
29:40 - working oh I need to install that um
29:43 - actually I can just change my
29:44 - interpreter select interpreter I think
29:46 - this is
29:48 - the correct one we'll see though and
29:51 - that's giving me an issue for some
29:53 - reason um file for module react GSX
29:57 - runtime implicitly as any type if the
29:59 - react package actually exposed this
30:01 - module consider sending a poll request
30:04 - okay damn it that's annoying I might
30:05 - just restart uh the react setup and do
30:08 - it uh without typescript because I feel
30:10 - like the typescript actually might cause
30:12 - more problems than uh than I was
30:13 - anticipating so let me take this API
30:15 - folder let me move it out
30:18 - here let's just restart this entire
30:21 - thing okay
30:25 - remove giveaway what are you guys

30:36 - that I know react enough that like once
30:38 - it's set up I can start working through
30:39 - it uh how are you going to tackle the
30:41 - part where you have to give the input
30:43 - code I don't know what you mean failed
30:45 - to delete do you yeah okay that's
30:49 - fine oh it's cuz it's running in the

31:45 - going to notice that like a lot of this
31:46 - stuff I've taught before but I still
31:48 - don't remember it just because there's
31:49 - like so much when you go between
31:50 - different programming languages that
31:52 - it's more just like knowing how to learn
31:55 - the new stuff if anything okay so this
31:57 - should uh create a database for us we
32:00 - need to create a user model in flask

33:04 - DNS no I have a series that does
33:05 - everything uh that you just mentioned
33:07 - except cloudfare I have a video
33:09 - connecting a domain to a lenoe uh VPS uh
33:13 - for flask API but it uh does not use

34:28 - CLG um I'm probably not going to code an
34:30 - Android app live to be honest with you
34:32 - it's just not something that I really
34:33 - want to do uh people are focusing on
34:36 - chat rather than on your code yeah I'm
34:37 - focusing on chat rather than on my code
34:39 - this is why we're getting nothing done
34:40 - right now it's okay this is what happens
34:41 - in all the streams I start being all
34:43 - flustered looking at the chat and then
34:45 - as soon as uh what is it we start really
34:47 - getting into it then I can start moving
34:49 - and actually coding stuff out because
34:50 - right now I haven't really done anything
34:52 - okay CD code racer yarn start nice and
34:56 - yarn oh I need to add that API script
34:59 - okay

35:16 - here views.py nice request jsonify is
35:21 - what I need to for now let's return
35:25 - jsonify sign up just to test this uh

35:33 - dictionary okay data sign
35:37 - up return
35:42 - jsonify sign out

35:56 - vitals forgot about that
36:00 - that okay that should work now and how
36:04 - many damn Chrome windows do I have here
36:06 - react app that's good don't need that
36:09 - what else is here don't need
36:12 - that okay refresh and go to slash login
36:18 - and that didn't work oh it's cuz I'm not
36:19 - running the API command failed can't
36:22 - open run api. py oh crap I deleted that

37:34 - package Json I also have two of
37:41 - these my music keeps turning
37:45 - off all right let's see what chat's
37:47 - saying wrong Port uh what port is this
37:50 - 5,000 I put 5,000 didn't I HTP yeah I
37:54 - did
37:56 - okay yeah I know it'll work if I go to
37:58 - uh 5,000 SL login uh
38:03 - wait did I not do this properly uh
38:08 - nit
38:10 - models views I have a login route am I
38:14 - doing something wrong return
38:16 - jsonify remove the space in return no no
38:19 - no that's that's definitely not the
38:21 - problem uh at views. root I think it
38:22 - might be in my init.py from views import
38:24 - views register view PL see no it was
38:26 - working SL log in say I'm getting a 404
38:29 - though um oh it's cuz I have/ API as a
38:33 - prefix that's why okay slash API slash
38:38 - login there you go now it's working okay
38:40 - so let's go back to
38:42 - 3000 SL API SL
38:46 - login why is it not working um it's I
38:50 - guess the proxy is not working let's see
38:52 - here run
38:53 - API package Json Local Host colon 5 ,000
38:58 - it shouldn't make a difference if I do
38:59 - 127 or not
39:03 - um let me see what what is what did I
39:05 - have I have another project where I did
39:07 - this and it worked so let's open that
39:09 - file open
39:11 - folder okay
39:14 - oops go to
39:17 - desktop and react tutorial no that's not
39:21 - where I did it I did it somewhere
39:26 - else
39:29 - hm check the Chrome
39:32 - console it's a good idea actually
39:35 - console yeah there's no problem that
39:37 - that should work though that's why I'm
39:38 - kind of confused because the login
39:40 - should be it should be going to the
39:42 - proxy uh but if for some reason I think
39:44 - it's just react is not sending it to the
39:46 - proxy uh maybe because I need like react
39:48 - router or something okay I'm going to
39:50 - this is how I got it to work in the
39:51 - previous one so let me try this uh yarn
39:55 - add react router I think that's what
39:58 - it's called let's see if that works
40:01 - fetching
40:02 - packages info warning react
40:06 - scripts oh did I not H why do have
40:10 - typescript interesting okay I think
40:13 - react router added itself uh what I can
40:16 - do though is just set up a route and
40:17 - then see if that works no I know uh guys
40:20 - video quality is good okay sweet uh you
40:22 - guys are saying I'm on the wrong thing
40:24 - the thing is what I want to happen is
40:25 - from here I want it to re redirect me to
40:28 - my flask API so I want to be on the
40:31 - react URL and then I want it to work so
40:33 - like proxy over to the uh the flask one
40:36 - I know the flask one works uh but uh I I
40:40 - need to get the proxy to work
40:41 - essentially okay I need to delete that
40:43 - read me G ignore is
40:46 - fine okay API views maybe I didn't save
40:50 - this file or something no this this file
40:52 - is
40:53 - working package Jon proxy
40:57 - and now I want to do in
41:00 - Source the router okay so now I forget
41:03 - how you do this damn router I know I
41:05 - have to import it say
41:08 - import
41:09 - router from or import yeah is it
41:13 - router from react router again need to
41:17 - reference some code here so I can see
41:19 - how this works Sublime Text file open
41:24 - folder and desktop YouTube code I know I
41:28 - did in this react
41:31 - Jango okay let's open
41:34 - that okay music controller no front end
41:38 - and SRC component app oh my God that's
41:42 - really
41:44 - big app is rendering the homepage
41:46 - homepage has my router in it here okay
41:50 - router switch let's just copy all that
41:53 - and then we can leave that there
41:59 - okay that actually looks like that works
42:01 - now let's
42:02 - go and take the rest is the music did
42:06 - the music stop I think the music did
42:08 - stop how do I put this on a loop okay
42:10 - Play There You
42:14 - Go import
42:21 - this nice okay I guess I don't need link
42:24 - right now now let's get rid of all of
42:26 - these other roots that I don't
42:29 - need nice okay exact path render no I
42:33 - don't need all
42:40 - that slash root okay nice and then let's
42:44 - just put a P tag here and just
42:47 - say
42:50 - home okay this should work now
42:54 - hopefully react app we just throw that
42:57 - on here why is that not
43:01 - going is there a reason I can't put this
43:03 - tab here okay
43:06 - um that's annoying can I put this tab on
43:09 - this one yes I
43:11 - can okay what the heck that's all right
43:15 - that's fine I guess that just doesn't
43:16 - have to work oh yarn
43:23 - start uh Local Host refused to connect
43:26 - oh now it's connect connecting
43:28 - twice it's Incognito oh Smart Guys very

45:19 - proxy the react routes so that they go
45:22 - to my backend API I had this working
45:24 - like flawlessly previously so I don't
45:26 - know why it's not working right now but
45:28 - uh let's look here
45:31 - J
45:37 - okay
45:44 - router go here I don't think I need the
45:46 - switch
45:48 - actually I think I can do it without the
45:51 - switch um oh no I do need to switch
45:55 - oops either way I'm confused why this
45:57 - isn't routing back to my API H Source
46:18 - index.js H you need the switch 12 hours
46:23 - it's router not route um yeah I have if
46:26 - I have router here I don't I'm so why is
46:29 - this not working I don't know why this

47:35 - going to work GBS Local Host 5000
47:39 - okay I'm just going to copy my other
47:41 - project that had this working
47:44 - website oh what the heck okay let's see
47:48 - if if that did
47:51 - anything no still not working eh you you

48:39 - someone was saying something that I
48:40 - thought made sense but
48:43 - um so maybe this is actually working
48:46 - it's just not returning anything it's
48:47 - just not showing anything on the screen
48:50 - uh let's go Network
48:57 - developer but the thing is I should see
48:59 - it hitting the end point here which I'm
49:00 - not seeing use uh use legendary stack
49:03 - Overflow guys stack Overflow isn't um
49:06 - isn't going to help here just run on
49:08 - diff server run just run server on diff
49:11 - ports these the okay let me explain the
49:14 - problem to you guys cuz a lot of you
49:15 - don't understand what's happening I have
49:16 - two servers I have one for my react
49:18 - front end and I link is defined but
49:20 - never used okay that's fine and then I
49:21 - have one for my python backend what I
49:24 - would like is whenever I go to a URL
49:26 - that is not defined by my react front
49:29 - end it automatically sends the request
49:31 - to my back end however uh when I do that
49:34 - nothing's happening and you can see that
49:35 - nothing's happening because if you look
49:36 - here on the right side this will show me
49:39 - a request for example if I go here and I
49:42 - go to
49:43 - 5,000 and I go to slash login you're
49:46 - going to see we get a 404 right because
49:47 - it actually hit that Port however what's
49:50 - happening with react is it is not uh
49:52 - proxying the requests over so I mean I
49:55 - guess we could go to the legendary stack
49:56 - over overflow but I I doubt it's going
49:58 - to give us our answer
50:00 - react not
50:03 - proxying okay sure let's do
50:07 - that uh by default uh the fetch API when
50:10 - used with an absolute URL will mirror
50:12 - the host page so calling
50:14 - fetch okay maybe I do need to fetch it
50:17 - let's let's just try this uh run API
50:21 - index. yes whoever said fetch I
50:23 - apologize I kind of ignored you let's
50:24 - just use a a hook here to do this so
50:28 - we'll say
50:33 - import use
50:35 - effect from
50:38 - react
50:39 - okay and say use
50:45 - effect I think that's how you do it yeah
50:48 - okay use effect and then we'll say
50:50 - actually Fetch and then let me just go
50:53 - SL API SL hello
50:58 - this be slash
51:01 - login do
51:03 - then
51:07 - response
51:10 - no stop going capital I don't want it to
51:13 - be capital okay and then dot
51:16 - then
51:21 - data okay uh response is not defined oh
51:25 - it's cuz I spell response
51:30 - wrong okay let's see
51:34 - this oops slash
51:39 - API that works now let's go
51:43 - 3,000 still not working eh log in okay
51:46 - so it does work when I do the fetch you
51:47 - know what that's fine because all I need
51:48 - to do is is work for fetch you can see
51:50 - it's it's console logging that so the
51:52 - fetch does work okay so it's it is
51:53 - actually working I was just an idiot
51:55 - before I thought it was going to show me
51:56 - something on screen uh but it didn't
51:58 - okay so we're good now now we can
52:00 - actually start setting something up so
52:01 - let's make a new let's actually make a
52:03 - folder let's call this components uh
52:07 - let's throw app into here let's throw
52:10 - our CSS in a new folder although I won't
52:13 - really do much CSS
52:16 - here
52:17 - move
52:19 - move now how impressive would it be if
52:22 - it automatically changed oh it did wow
52:24 - go vs code
52:26 - okay
52:27 - app.js I think it's good
52:31 - CSS nice okay let's make a new component
52:36 - uh actually I guess we could do a folder
52:37 - for like
52:39 - off and then do one in here new file
52:43 - this will be
52:46 - login.
52:48 - login.js okay new file this will be sign
52:55 - upjs and and then do we need a sign out
52:57 - page no we just will send a request when
52:58 - we want to sign out okay we got a $5
53:01 - super chat here thanks for teaching me

53:51 - what's done the music for like all of my
53:53 - live streams
53:57 - okay nice all right so we have that now
53:59 - I guess we could build a login page uh I
54:01 - want to make sure that material UI is
54:02 - working too so apps there let's close
54:05 - some of this stuff database is created
54:08 - model nice nice
54:10 - nice okay so we'll make a login page and
54:12 - then once we have that we can test our
54:13 - kind of off end points uh once we
54:15 - actually write them let me just copy all
54:17 - this and go here and we can delete that
54:21 - and delete that and we'll leave that in
54:24 - for now and we want to design a form so
54:28 - we need from Material
54:31 - UI import and this will be
54:35 - grid from Material UI SLC core let's see
54:40 - if we can steal one from the internet
54:43 - material

81:51 - lowkey I want something that's uh you
81:53 - know chill in the form oh is it cuz it's
81:56 - a form is it inside of a
81:59 - form ah no validate um class

82:11 - uh e. prevent default is that when you

82:18 - button
82:21 - onclick in the use effect I think it's
82:25 - here right you guys saying to do this
82:27 - like take e and do
82:31 - that maybe at the beginning of the
82:34 - submit function I think that's

82:38 - button so it doesn't I just type button
82:39 - okay that's
82:41 - good let's go here and then take e okay
82:45 - and
82:47 - then
82:49 - e
82:50 - e yes okay it seems like I've done it
82:53 - correctly let's see
82:57 - see but it's still it's still
83:00 - refreshing should it refresh though when
83:03 - I go to a different page shouldn't it do
83:08 - that warning failed prop type invalid
83:10 - prop variant of value body okay let's
83:14 - go
83:18 - here uh let's see
83:27 - thing is it's inside a form I don't want
83:28 - the form to
83:30 - submit um I don't know why it's
83:32 - submitting cuz I changed the button type
83:35 - so it's not even submit
83:41 - anymore maybe I need to refresh
83:53 - this also why is it going to API login
83:56 - so much oh it's cuz I have that damn
83:59 - where's the use effect thing I think
84:00 - that's why it's refreshing actually CU I
84:02 - have this use effect I don't need
84:09 - this right so it shouldn't be refreshing
84:12 - I don't know why it's refreshing don't
84:14 - have an account sign up and sign up's
84:16 - not working either need to fix that
84:18 - can't even press
84:21 - that don't have an account sign up that
84:23 - would be
84:26 - here why isn't this working why is and
84:29 - why did I need this is that a thing why
84:31 - do I need that in there variant body 2
84:34 - Link to sign

84:43 - JS where did I forget the
84:46 - JS password reset e. prevent
84:51 - default this should work why isn't not
85:00 - working
85:06 - link see I have
85:08 - two and then if I go here ah there you
85:18 - go see like this isn't for some reason
85:21 - this doesn't work failed property
85:23 - invalid variant of type P maybe that's
85:26 - why maybe it's cuz the typography
85:28 - thing's wrong let's change this to be
85:30 - body body 2 or something okay variant
85:33 - body
85:35 - to
85:38 - refresh why why is it not work it's a
85:41 - sign up you have a typo change href to
85:46 - and Link I've done that it's a correct
85:48 - link but it's not clicking see I can't
85:50 - click on it send reset email okay
85:55 - can I go to
85:56 - slome okay let's go to slash sign
86:02 - up okay when I press sign up it doesn't
86:04 - refresh okay that's good but when I go
86:05 - to a different page it refreshes I think
86:06 - that makes sense but this isn't working
86:08 - I swear the HF thing is correct um
86:11 - inspect element and
86:13 - check
86:15 - inspect a 2 equals log in see cuz I I
86:19 - think it needs an href because it worked
86:21 - with the href you guys are saying change
86:23 - it to two but
86:25 - I think it's h because is link
86:27 - imported see it's from Material UI core
86:29 - it's not from react router that's why
86:32 - okay we found the problem
86:35 - guys react router Dom there you go now
86:41 - they'll work if I change these
86:51 - all does not contain a default export
86:56 - what oh I gota do
87:08 - this okay let's go
87:10 - here come on there now it works boom and
87:15 - it doesn't refresh perfect okay fail
87:18 - prop type two in link but it's never
87:22 - defined what file is that
87:26 - uh I guess we can just do
87:29 - this two
87:33 - equals wait no that should work is it
87:36 - cuz I have the link wrong sign
87:42 - up react router
87:46 - Dom these should all
87:49 - work so it's on this page let's see no
87:54 - want move the console
87:58 - up how do I make this damn console
88:00 - bigger come on scroll up there you go
88:02 - okay
88:04 - refresh oh okay now it's working wait
88:08 - now this one's saying it's not
88:15 - working
88:16 - link and maybe have another link oh it's
88:19 - cuz I have two that I didn't change
88:20 - that's why okay so log in
88:24 - yeah that's why see this needs to be two
88:26 - there you go all right let's see what
88:28 - everyone's saying uh is there GitHub
88:30 - repo there is not currently GitHub repo
88:31 - for this project not right now
88:38 - um it's so funny the I figure out the
88:40 - issue but and then you guys I look in
88:42 - the chat and you've already told me what
88:43 - it is I could have just looked there
88:45 - although there is like a slight bit of
88:46 - latency okay let's test this okay boom
88:49 - golden okay now I want like a nice um
88:53 - like nav
88:54 - that shows like log in sign up all that
88:57 - and then I also want it to give like an
88:58 - error message if you try to submit
89:00 - without a password or without an email
89:02 - um I think I can do that if I remove the
89:05 - no validate
89:06 - thing I remember doing this at some
89:09 - point um having like a having something
89:12 - that would give you like a
89:14 - problem where's the
89:19 - form okay no
89:22 - validate let's see
89:28 - H okay let's see here material UI
89:31 - validate
89:39 - form no come on just just give me
89:43 - the not example just
89:48 - form form control
90:04 - I swear I did this
90:06 - in
90:10 - here go to create
90:13 - [Music]
90:21 - room okay why is it sh this all weird
90:25 - Okay
90:45 - container okay I think I did it manually
90:47 - with this like alert structure I'm going
90:49 - to copy this
90:54 - what is that imported from
90:56 - collapse tii core all
91:00 - right I should have put this in all
91:02 - these Pages before container CSS
91:05 - Baseline div paper want it to be in the
91:09 - div below this
91:12 - yeah okay
91:15 - now let's import
91:22 - collapse yeah
91:26 - Port collapse from at Material UI core
91:30 - all
91:34 - right that was the music app that was uh
91:36 - do you guys really not like the music
91:38 - that much I'll turn it down
91:40 - um in in case it's it's bugging you guys
91:43 - because you can always turn it on
91:44 - yourself
91:46 - but let's
91:51 - see give the form a required field I'm
91:54 - pretty sure that they all say required
91:55 - on them um see
91:58 - required but it doesn't I don't think it
92:00 - like the form is not validating them oh
92:02 - it's cuz I'm not using a material UI
92:04 - form that would be why probably yeah
92:07 - what is the form control thing material
92:09 - UI uh form control import form form
92:13 - control yeah that would be
92:19 - why uh actually I guess I could just put
92:22 - it in here
92:33 - okay put something in the chat if you'd
92:35 - like me to change the music or turn it
92:38 - off because we can always turn off
92:50 - too is the stream on 144p no the stream

101:46 - lose your password you just you're going
101:47 - to be screwed uh okay so let's go
101:50 - material UI
101:54 - and
101:55 - then um material
101:59 - UI I I wanted to validate the form
102:01 - that's what I want to do good
102:11 - reminder okay so I imported the form
102:18 - control and then
102:20 - this uh we will mess with this in a
102:22 - minute
102:25 - it I don't want a success I just want an
102:29 - error
102:35 - here state.
102:43 - success severity on close
102:50 - Okay collapse
102:56 - there we
102:58 - go okay we will look at that in second
103:01 - is collapse and alert both
103:09 - imported okay this needs to be form
103:18 - control
103:21 - slash form control nice
103:25 - nice okay compiling let's see cannot
103:29 - resolve material UI
103:32 - core there you go no not at types just
103:36 - at
103:41 - okay compiling come on come on fail to
103:44 - compile alert is not
103:49 - exported where is alert from I'm going
103:52 - to have to find it
103:54 - here ah it's from Lab
104:09 - okay cannot import
104:21 - that cannot resolve what the heck this
104:24 - should
104:26 - work oh it's cuz I I probably need to
104:29 - install that yarn install at
104:33 - Material ui/
104:41 - laap hydrate guys I'm drinking water I
104:44 - got you
104:50 - [Music]
104:57 - what id excuse me what IDE am I using I
104:59 - am using visual studio
105:02 - code okay I think this is going to work
105:05 - now form control provides context such
105:08 - as filled Focus error uh required for
105:11 - form
105:14 - inputs
105:15 - form okay
105:24 - slash
105:26 - login come on I wanted to highlight red
105:29 - when I oh maybe it's cuz I did it what
105:31 - page I did un sign up that would be
105:34 - why all
105:36 - right canot read property State oh yeah
105:40 - I forgot about
105:45 - that we'll just go for now collapse in
105:51 - false and this isn't going to work work
105:54 - just
105:57 - say okay
106:00 - now see it's not giving me the damn red
106:03 - outlines I want it to give me I don't
106:06 - want it to let me like press this
106:08 - button unless it's there uh
106:12 - [Music]
106:20 - maybe what can I do to fix this let's
106:23 - see form
106:37 - control
106:40 - h okay you know what that's a problem
106:42 - for later we don't really need to fix
106:43 - that right now uh I can make it flash an
106:45 - error message if we if we get an error
106:47 - message um and I'm going to do that
106:49 - actually okay where do I have the alert
106:52 - let's Implement a State here with an
106:54 - error message so let's say
106:56 - const
106:59 - error set error equals use
107:04 - State
107:08 - okay and here
107:15 - on state does not equal empty
107:18 - quotes Okay and then on close
107:27 - set error to that okay and then the
107:31 - alert this is going to be whatever the
107:33 - error message is what am why why am I
107:35 - typing State should be air
107:41 - okay okay so let's just make it and see
107:43 - if this works let's
107:46 - say set error
107:57 - is that in sign up this is an error
108:01 - message perfect okay that works I want
108:02 - it to be a little bit below the sign up
108:05 - but for now I can live with that error
108:06 - message and let's Implement that on the
108:09 - other one so collapse nice just going to
108:12 - go and log
108:15 - in we go underneath this this would be
108:20 - form control 2
108:30 - let's copy these
108:41 - Imports and we need the state
108:44 - too okay
108:49 - state state and alert
108:56 - and
108:57 - alert password
109:00 - reset nice okay let's see what chat's
109:03 - saying
109:10 - here set required equals true in form
109:12 - control
109:13 - props let's try that I need to change
109:16 - this one too
109:39 - oops
109:50 - okay okay that's not working it's fine I
109:52 - don't I don't need the uh the thing to
109:54 - highlight red right now I think I can
109:55 - figure that out later that that's
109:57 - something that's like hopefully easy to
109:59 - do so we'll leave that for later when
110:00 - I'm like tired and uh and don't know
110:03 - what to do here okay where else did I
110:05 - put required equals true because I want
110:06 - to remove that I think I put it here
110:09 - okay so now we have login page sign up
110:12 - page we can navigate between them great
110:14 - what we want to do now is make it so you
110:16 - can actually sign in so this is where it
110:18 - gets a little bit tough I have this uh
110:20 - kind of blog post thing that I found
110:22 - that I think is going to help us do this
110:25 - and involves installing a few things
110:26 - let's just move this over to the side
110:29 - here and let's now try to write the back
110:32 - end so we can actually stop that we can
110:35 - stop that and we're going to add these
110:37 - to our
110:38 - requirements so let's go
110:42 - requirements and I already added that
110:44 - one want this
110:48 - one
110:50 - okay oops want to stop that
110:55 - okay so what I want to do is
110:56 - authenticate my front end with my back
110:58 - end so that the front end can send the
110:59 - information to the back end we can
111:01 - create like a user account and then uh
111:04 - we can like return information back to
111:06 - the front end saying yes this user was
111:07 - signed and no this user wasn't signed in
111:09 - and then once I have this authentication
111:10 - done stuff gets a lot easier the
111:12 - authentication is like the most pain in
111:13 - the ass to do to be honest um yeah so
111:17 - I'm going to just literally copy a lot
111:18 - of the stuff that's here get the O
111:19 - working and then once the O is working
111:22 - we're we're good we can start actually
111:23 - working on the sockets and then making
111:25 - it so two people get kept paired
111:26 - together and all of that fun
111:32 - stuff some people are asking what a
111:34 - typing racer clone is what I'm doing is
111:37 - making code racer so there's going to be
111:38 - a block of code and then there's going
111:40 - to be two people facing off against each
111:42 - other and whoever types the block of
111:43 - code first is going to win that's the
111:44 - idea and it's going to track your like
111:46 - WM and everything uh while you're typing
111:49 - and that's kind of the uh the
111:51 - goal and then ideally we'll have like
111:53 - scores right so we'll have like you know
111:55 - this person won this many races this
111:56 - person's average wpm is this we have
111:58 - like a leaderboard uh I can add like a
112:00 - ton of stuff to it so we just want to
112:02 - get the core functionality working first
112:04 - okay so I have all the requirements
112:05 - installed now let's see what this is
112:09 - okay man this guy just put a ton of code
112:12 - in one
112:14 - file
112:15 - okay so we need to Define that okay so
112:20 - let's close this
112:27 - API a
112:30 - nit okay we have these two
112:36 - variables my database is working I
112:38 - already have that set up okay
112:43 - nice and guard. AIT okay that's the
112:46 - thing I need I need guard and I need
112:48 - cores so let's import those
112:56 - okay flask I need guard and
113:02 - course and I gu actually let's just do
113:04 - this say
113:06 - from flask
113:09 - that import
113:14 - PR there you go okay and then from flas
113:20 - cores
113:24 - import
113:25 - CRS all cap is that I think that's going
113:29 - to work hopefully let's see so then I
113:31 - should be able to initialize it like
113:33 - this and stay nice and
113:35 - consistent uh why are you using flask
113:37 - instead of Jango because this is like a
113:38 - really simple back end I don't need a
113:40 - lot of stuff so I'd rather just use
113:41 - flask than mess around with d Jango
113:43 - which is actually just going to take
113:44 - longer to do uh python is for people who
113:46 - are scared of curly braces very very
113:47 - true hi Tim hope you're doing well yes I
113:50 - am doing well thank you for uh joining
113:51 - the live stream still have 667 of you
113:54 - here very impressive that this many of
113:55 - you are still watching going for about 2
113:57 - hours now I am still alive but I have 10
114:00 - hours left to go have not had any
114:01 - caffeine yet have not had anything to
114:03 - eat since uh breakfast we'll probably
114:05 - have lunch kind of
114:07 - soon what are you doing at the end of
114:09 - this ideally I'm going to host the site
114:11 - and then hopefully I could race against
114:12 - you guys but I don't um I don't know if
114:15 - we're going to get that far I I think we
114:17 - are like I'm optimistic that we'll be
114:18 - able to finish this uh but I just
114:20 - haven't been moving as fast as I was
114:21 - expecting to go just because there's a
114:22 - lot of stuff I don't know how to do yet
114:24 - so once I learn how to do all of these
114:25 - things then there'll be less that I need
114:27 - to learn how to do and so we can move it
114:29 - quicker let me move this over a
114:31 - bit okay so we need to define a generic
114:34 - user model just going to copy that and
114:37 - put that in my
114:39 - models okay it needs to import DB so
114:43 - from do import
114:46 - DB is that going to give me a circular
114:49 - import I don't think that will give me a
114:51 - circular import I think that'll be
114:53 - fine um and yes and then from Models
114:58 - import user okay nice guard. AIT app I
115:02 - need that too init.py
115:06 - okay db. AIT app uh and then course. AIT
115:14 - app okay and this can
115:18 - go above
115:21 - here okay nice and oh I need to define
115:24 - the user model before I do that that's
115:25 - fine say from Models import
115:29 - user
115:33 - here from Models import user H is that
115:36 - going to
115:39 - work I let's see here I actually don't
115:43 - think that's going to work I think I
115:44 - need to initialize the database before
115:46 - for so initialize database Define user
115:51 - Define all this stuff
115:52 - then initialize
115:56 - guard but I need to have the user
115:59 - defined first and the user's importing
116:00 - that H okay this is kind of annoying
116:03 - actually um I might just bite the bolt
116:06 - and not put this in a separate
116:08 - file and save us some time okay let's do
116:13 - this no we don't have to worry about
116:17 - that okay I think that'll be
116:20 - fine do import
116:23 - DB yeah I think that should be fine um
116:26 - let's see what everyone's saying here
116:27 - Tim you need a nightbot I have a
116:31 - nightbot I using flask yeah uh I'm
116:34 - building a code racer so two people have
116:37 - to uh type the same code as fast as
116:39 - possible right now we're just handling
116:40 - the authentication getting the users
116:42 - it's what you would do for like any
116:43 - website really uh and then we can
116:45 - actually start working on the UI for
116:46 - that ideally we're just going to start
116:48 - by throwing two people in a room
116:50 - together showing a block of code and
116:52 - then whoever types it first and then
116:53 - I'll add all of the uh other stuff
116:55 - related to that so like word words per
116:58 - minute and all that kind of crap okay so
117:00 - app. config yes I've configured the
117:03 - database already that's good db. anit
117:06 - app so I guess I
117:08 - init what is this I think I'm just
117:10 - trying to figure out the order to do
117:11 - this in I don't know if it matters the
117:13 - order in which I initialize all these
117:16 - things so guard happens
117:20 - first okay
117:23 - and then database and then CRS okay and
117:26 - then add an example user add some Roots
117:29 - okay log
117:31 - in and that's good we'll actually use a
117:34 - lot of these refresh
117:36 - token I will copy
117:38 - that okay nice so save that
117:43 - views let's say at views.
117:48 - root refresh an existing JWT by creating
117:51 - one let copy the old one example okay
117:54 - that's fine can leave that print refresh
117:58 - request old token e request. getet data
118:01 - guard. fres
118:03 - JWT so this needs access to guard I'm
118:06 - going to
118:07 - say
118:09 - from uh do import
118:13 - guard is that what it's
118:15 - called guard DB cores okay
118:23 - actually going to delete everything in
118:28 - here and then nit this no longer needs
118:31 - to yep that's
118:38 - good use. root
118:40 - okay let's see what they're doing here
118:43 - for
118:44 - this take
118:46 - that is that log in
118:49 - yeah okay request equals FL reest est.
118:52 - getjson we can just say request. getjson
118:55 - because we already have request
118:57 - imported username password okay user
119:00 - equals guard. authenticate username
119:01 - guard access token sweet that looks
119:04 - pretty good to me if that works nice
119:07 - okay
119:08 - refresh and then we would do need to
119:10 - sign up but I'll write that one myself
119:12 - okay and then
119:15 - protected okay we'll look at that after
119:18 - all right so let's actually do this and
119:20 - create this sample
119:23 - user in a
119:30 - net okay with app. context db. create
119:34 - all db. session. query let's make mine
119:36 - okay so say
119:38 - Tim password Tim is great rolls
119:44 - admin
119:46 - username
119:49 - Tim okay user is Def
119:52 - find nice what's chat saying
119:57 - here I do know how to solve a Rubik's
119:59 - Cube actually maybe I'll do that on
120:00 - stream maybe during a break I'll try to
120:02 - solve one I haven't solved it in like a
120:03 - long time but I do have a Speed Cube um
120:06 - I'm not that good at it but maybe I will
120:07 - do that that that would be fun that
120:08 - would be like a non-interruptive thing
120:11 - um I hope you guys play this game all
120:13 - day once it works there is an API to
120:15 - find code Snippets it picks them up from
120:17 - GitHub Tim what's your stack I'm using
120:18 - react and flask those are kind of the
120:20 - two main Frameworks right now hey Tim
120:22 - will there be a bot tracer on code racer
120:25 - what if I use selenium and Pi Auto goey
120:27 - to speed type it sh don't don't tell
120:29 - anyone that okay just guys don't don't
120:31 - try to hack my website you will probably
120:33 - be able to okay uh let's actually delete
120:38 - this
120:41 - database and let's
120:44 - go um yarn
120:47 - API let's see how many errors we get no
120:50 - errors it's impressive I I am surprised
120:52 - I'm very surprised okay so now I want to
120:55 - actually use this
120:59 - let's should I curl something to the
121:02 - login or should I just try to hook it up
121:05 - we'll try to hook it up okay let's go
121:06 - components off log in and we'll send a
121:11 - fetch to that now submit pressed okay so
121:14 - prevent default yes and then we say
121:17 - fetch and sorry that's not the way it is
121:20 - it's going to be Fetch and then and it's
121:22 - going to be
121:23 - API SL API slash login and then we need
121:28 - to make this I guess actually is this a
121:31 - post request request.
121:34 - getjson yeah I guess we would post to
121:37 - the log in is this accepting what what
121:41 - type is this yeah the login is a post
121:43 - okay so let's just make this just a
121:45 - post
121:47 - okay and let post two and so now I got
121:50 - to go copy my my things here to send the
121:53 - fetch
121:54 - request
121:56 - okay let's
122:00 - go to log in did my music stop what's
122:03 - going on
122:07 - here oh my speakers turned off again
122:09 - that's
122:12 - why are you going to keep it up with ads
122:14 - and stuff no probably not like I'll
122:16 - leave it up if I get this hosted I'll
122:17 - I'll leave the site up but I'm not going
122:18 - to put ads on or anything this is I'm
122:20 - not doing this to make money I'm just
122:21 - doing this cuz fun
122:24 - um okay let's do
122:26 - that application Json body
122:29 - json.stringify
122:32 - and then we'll
122:35 - stringify email
122:39 - email
122:42 - password password
122:44 - nice okay and then I do need to send the
122:48 - token as well with this um
122:52 - oh no this will return a token to me
122:53 - when I send this okay so that should
122:55 - work let's try
122:58 - this request
123:01 - options do then and I'll explain what
123:04 - I'm doing in just a second guys once
123:05 - this is somewhat working request options
123:08 - should be
123:11 - response response. Json okay and then do
123:17 - then and this will be data and and we'll
123:22 - just
123:25 - console.log data okay so what I'm doing
123:29 - now is I'm trying to set up
123:30 - authentication between my front end and
123:32 - my back end so what's going to happen is
123:34 - the front end is going to send a request
123:36 - that contains the username and password
123:37 - to the back end the back end is going to
123:40 - authenticate that data and then it's
123:42 - going to send what's known as a JWT
123:44 - token to the front end that token is
123:46 - going to be kind of like hey I'm signed
123:48 - in I have permission to use all these
123:50 - other endpoints so anytime another
123:52 - request is sent to the back end that JWT
123:54 - token needs to be a part of that request
123:56 - and so that's how the back end knows
123:58 - that the front end is authenticated is
124:00 - by using this JWT token um and so that's
124:04 - kind of what I'm trying to set up right
124:05 - now is uh there's this thing called my
124:07 - mouse is lagging like crazy Jesus if you
124:11 - uh look at these two libraries right
124:13 - here those are what's kind of doing that
124:15 - for you so you could make your own JWT
124:17 - token authentication system but it's
124:19 - really a pain so I'm just importing
124:20 - these two libraries and kind of just
124:22 - copying some code that sets it up for
124:26 - me okay um let's see here I'm going to
124:31 - take a break in one second I just want
124:33 - to test if this is working so that
124:35 - going and yarn
124:44 - start yeah I don't know why my mouse is
124:46 - lagging so much maybe it's because it's
124:48 - wireless mouse not sure
124:52 - only 10 more hours yep only 10 more
124:54 - hours
124:58 - guys let's see what people are saying
125:02 - here I'm still surprised by how many of
125:04 - you guys want to uh to watch this chat
125:06 - also I'm not ignoring anyone I see some
125:08 - of you guys like mad I'm not responding
125:09 - to you it's just genuinely the chat's
125:11 - moving so fast I uh I never like I just
125:14 - don't see a lot of the messages okay so
125:16 - let's try
125:19 - this respect to that okay so that did
125:22 - happen to API login but then there was
125:25 - an error the server responded with the
125:26 - status of 401 unauthorized we got an
125:29 - object authorization this username and
125:31 - our password are incorrect okay that's
125:32 - good that's a very good sign that that
125:34 - that's working actually well not working
125:36 - but working well enough okay let's go to
125:39 - nitop
125:41 - P oh see this is a
125:44 - problem is this problem what did I make
125:47 - it username Tim password Tim is
125:50 - great didn't I make
125:53 - Tim is great log
126:01 - in that should have that should have
126:03 - worked
126:05 - though filter by username Tim Okay db.
126:09 - session.
126:12 - add should have a user with name Tim
126:15 - with app.
126:17 - context okay may I I bet I did this in
126:19 - the wrong order that's probably why
126:22 - okay so after everything is set up and
126:24 - initialized that's when this happens so
126:27 - I guess I have to do this once the app
126:28 - is is running no that wouldn't be the
126:34 - case now I got to remember how to query
126:36 - the Dame the damn uh D Jango
126:41 - database you forked material UI by
126:44 - mistake oh I didn't mean to do that what
126:46 - is this project supposed to be it's a
126:48 - code racer uh we're going to build an
126:50 - application allows users to
126:52 - uh race typing out a block of
126:55 - code and users I don't know why that
126:58 - didn't
126:59 - work maybe the user is
127:02 - there
127:04 - H okay we're going to say SQL
127:23 - that's not what I
127:24 - want um how can I select okay SQL
127:37 - query user. query. filter by that's what
127:40 - I'm looking for okay so let's
127:44 - print uh from dot
127:49 - import user
127:52 - print user. query. filterby and this is
127:54 - going to
127:56 - be username
127:59 - equals
128:01 - tim. first our username
128:05 - equals
128:12 - username okay let's see if that works
128:16 - now none okay so there is no user with
128:18 - username of um Tim I guess unless it's
128:22 - giving me the wrong username let's print
128:25 - the
128:27 - username maybe that's why maybe the
128:29 - username is
128:31 - none log in ah that would be why so I
128:35 - guess did I'm not oh it's I probably
128:37 - passing it incorrectly here let's
128:39 - see ah it's I'm passing email not
128:42 - username that would be why stupid I
128:45 - should check that okay so that now
128:47 - that's working so that actually says
128:48 - gives us our access token now sweet okay
128:51 - so the auth is working now we just got
128:52 - to create an account okay I'm going to
128:54 - go to the washroom and grab like a
128:56 - coffee I think and I will be right back
128:58 - ready you get to see a cool transition
128:59 - screen here boom be right back
130:29 - for
133:15 - all right I'm
133:17 - back you guys need a react tutorial
133:20 - guess what I'm working working on a
133:21 - react tutorial right now actually like
133:23 - it's like in
133:33 - progress and I don't have a series on
133:34 - react but I have a series where I like
133:37 - go through an entire project that uses
133:40 - react so like I don't know I'm a bit
133:43 - confused is react like a library that
133:44 - you could import already made elements
133:45 - from uh react is like a front-end
133:48 - framework it's kind of hard to describe
133:50 - like quick if you've never seen it
133:52 - before but uh I don't think you're
133:54 - importing like pre-built stuff
133:56 - necessarily it just like a way of
133:58 - writing a front end uh did you get a
134:01 - full-time job offer from Microsoft I
134:03 - don't know if I can disclose that or not
134:05 - they offer me to come back as an intern
134:06 - again but I am not returning to
134:08 - Microsoft at least not right
134:11 - now Rubik's Cube video maybe I'll have
134:14 - to do that I have to set up like a I
134:15 - don't have a scene on um on OBS to like
134:19 - show my working surface but I just made
134:21 - of coffee I have my nice uh reheatable
134:24 - mug I'm not sure if you guys have ever
134:25 - seen those before but this mug will like
134:26 - keep my coffee warm it has like a
134:28 - battery in it it's actually pretty cool
134:30 - 10minute code I'm sorry for ignoring you
134:33 - Rubik's Cube
134:35 - stream um where am I going to host I'm
134:38 - not sure yet probably Len node uh react
134:41 - makes it easy to make Elements which you
134:42 - can easily import to other files correct
134:44 - yep you're looking so cute man I
134:46 - appreciate it thank you very much
134:55 - you should make a website for courses
134:56 - you've uploaded on YouTube yeah that
134:57 - wouldn't be a bad idea actually why are
134:59 - you using react cuz react is like the
135:01 - only front end framework I know I suck
135:02 - at front end development guys I'm like
135:04 - really not good at it um that so I've
135:07 - just picked the stuff that I know how to
135:08 - use okay so refresh that's good login
135:11 - works that gives the authentication
135:13 - token so let's try that protected route
135:17 - I'm really surprised this is working
135:18 - usually this takes way longer okay let's
135:21 - try
135:24 - this okay that do off
135:28 - required so I need to import that here
135:32 - too
135:34 - okay let's import this actually let's
135:37 - import both of
135:42 - these so this would
135:44 - be Oh no I got to import the thing okay
135:47 - flask
135:59 - I don't think anyone's good at front end
136:01 - yeah that's probably
136:04 - true my face looks
136:06 - bloated maybe it's the camera
136:09 - zoom can make it even more if you
136:17 - want are you using python as an API yes
136:20 - correct I am doing that are you familiar
136:23 - with python decorators yes I have built
136:25 - python decorators um 10-minute code you
136:27 - got to stop spamming that otherwise I'm
136:29 - just going to ban you uh because you
136:31 - just keep spamming in the
136:37 - chat H our viewership has dropped I
136:39 - guess I was not exciting enough for
136:41 - everyone that's all right let's see here
136:44 - what was our our Peak viewers at is it
136:46 - going to show me
136:48 - 957 wow it's a lot
136:59 - all right 32,000 people have played back
137:01 - this stream it always blows my mind when
137:03 - I do this stuff live how many people are
137:04 - actually watching
137:13 - this ASMR yeah do you guys like
137:15 - that this is a this is a coffee I'm
137:18 - drinking
137:21 - the delay on the stream is not actually
137:22 - bad um I'm looking at my preview and
137:26 - let's see it's maybe about 10 seconds so
137:30 - not horrible I could make it better but
137:32 - then the uh the quality would be worse
137:34 - of the stream and I think this quality
137:36 - is good from what you guys are
137:38 - saying on your last stream your Peak
137:40 - viewers was like 300 yeah exactly my
137:42 - last stream the peak viewers was like
137:44 - 300 and I think my average views was
137:46 - maybe like 100 right now it looks like
137:47 - we're averaging like 600 so like it I
137:51 - obviously it doesn't really matter to me
137:52 - to be honest it's just cool to talk to
137:53 - any amount of people but neat how many
137:55 - people are watching the
137:58 - stream okay so protected endpoint and
138:01 - then I have the login we will do the
138:04 - sign up after access token R nice okay
138:10 - so let's try to hit a protected endpoint
138:14 - if this works with that token so let's
138:16 - make some State here and let's say const
138:23 - off actually I guess we'll do JWT token
138:28 - set token or we could just make it token
138:31 - I guess that's
138:33 - fine
138:35 - equals use
138:37 - State okay and then here we will
138:46 - say need the curly braces
138:51 - okay so if data or
138:55 - if where is the return
138:58 - here oh it's going to crash what was
139:00 - what's the return type that's access
139:02 - token okay
139:06 - if access token in
139:09 - data then set
139:12 - token data at
139:16 - accessor
139:18 - token okay and and then what we'll do
139:22 - after that is we will internal server
139:25 - error what okay that's weird we will
139:27 - send to that protect end points we'll
139:29 - say
139:32 - fetch I always forget that that's not
139:34 - how the fetch
139:37 - Works SL API SL protected do
139:44 - then
139:46 - response and this will be response. Json
139:52 - do then data
139:56 - data and we'll console
140:00 - log okay so let's just walk through what
140:02 - I've done here for a second just in case
140:04 - anyone's a little bit confused we've
140:05 - created the backend API we now have it
140:08 - so that we can log in I created a sample
140:10 - user username Tim password Tim is great
140:13 - and when you send that data here it will
140:14 - authenticate that user if the user in
140:17 - the database password and username is
140:18 - correct it will return an access token
140:20 - for you then that access token is what
140:22 - you need to use to be able to actually
140:25 - access uh all of these different
140:26 - endpoints that are protected and a
140:28 - protected endpoint is one in which uh
140:30 - has this at flask uh whatever you say
140:33 - for this off required and so you need to
140:35 - send a token in the form of uh the
140:38 - bearer so authorization Bearer and then
140:39 - your token and when you send that then
140:41 - it will allow you to access these end
140:43 - points so all the end points relating to
140:44 - like joining a room or like updating
140:47 - score or anything like that uh will be
140:49 - related or will be protected by by the
140:51 - authentication and it's like your
140:52 - settings and stuff you want to change
140:54 - your username uh which I think I'll
140:55 - allow people to do okay so I need to go
140:59 - to login API protected but then in here
141:03 - this needs to have new request options
141:06 - so I'm going to say const options
141:11 - equals then this will be just copy all
141:13 - that
141:20 - content type application
141:22 - Json and then
141:25 - Au
141:29 - rization Bearer and then this will be
141:33 - plus
141:35 - token that should work no plus
141:39 - token oh that's cuz it's like
141:45 - this okay there you go bear is that what
141:47 - it looks like I think so yeah bear your
141:50 - token okay cuz that's a header nice and
141:54 - then for the body doesn't need any
141:56 - body so that's fine and then this will
142:00 - be
142:02 - options fetch what's my
142:06 - issue const
142:08 - [Music]
142:11 - options that was a problem
142:14 - okay could not proxy
142:16 - request oh that's fine could not proxy
142:19 - could not proxy see expect it does not
142:21 - equal
142:23 - equal where's
142:29 - that login.js expected not equal
142:33 - to that's fine error could not proxy
142:38 - request Babel parser index that's fine
142:43 - fresh okay nice
142:46 - Tim Tim is
142:48 - great oh my API failed what name app is
142:52 - not
142:53 - defined oh I'm an idiot okay this needs
142:56 - to be at
142:59 - views nice okay yarn
143:04 - API the stream has been going for 2
143:06 - hours and 25 minutes so far I'm not sure
143:09 - if it Autos saves on YouTube right now
143:10 - like I don't know if you can rewind um
143:13 - but yeah let's see what other people are
143:14 - saying
143:22 - log in uncaught
143:25 - promise uh API
143:28 - protected attaching
143:31 - 405 okay uncut promise
143:40 - again H so we be in here okay let's see
143:48 - this that would be why
143:53 - why is it removing my quotation marks on
143:55 - authorization why is it doing that
143:58 - should it
143:59 - not is this not the way it should
144:04 - be no can I how do I save without
144:07 - formatting there you go okay let's try
144:10 - that unexpected
144:16 - token okay let's just look at the
144:17 - response then
144:22 - maybe I didn't oh I didn't jsonify it
144:25 - maybe that's the reason let's
144:29 - see cuz previously the
144:37 - turn
144:48 - H I don't know why this isn't okay let
144:51 - me just print how do I look at the
144:53 - headers of a
144:54 - request
144:58 - um look at
145:02 - headers request. headers all right
145:07 - print request.
145:14 - headers could at least print the
145:18 - headers to restart this
145:25 - maybe hm
145:27 - 405 why is it not printing this though I
145:30 - don't know why it's not printing
145:33 - that
145:35 - authorization maybe I'm just spelling
145:37 - authorization wrong how possible is that
145:39 - let's
145:40 - see no it looks like I was doing it
145:42 - right plus
145:46 - token maybe the token is uh is not
145:49 - working
145:51 - no the token should be
145:54 - working H let's see
146:05 - here unexpected token okay 405 method
146:11 - not that would be why method not allowed
146:13 - I'm sending a post it needs to be a
146:17 - g if only I read the error messages
146:24 - what the heck log in connection closed
146:27 - okay let's just restart
146:34 - this is this not refresh okay Tim Tim is
146:41 - great 401 unauthorized okay so at least
146:44 - it's not uh crashing now it's just
146:46 - giving us unauthorized
146:50 - guess the token is wrong quest.
146:53 - headers so now it's not printing the
146:56 - request. headers I guess there was no
146:57 - headers to
146:59 - print
147:12 - H login API
147:16 - protected options response. Json 401
147:21 - unauthorized bear token authorization
147:25 - bear I don't maybe I don't need
147:27 - that maybe that's what's causing the
147:30 - problem there you go that looks like
147:32 - that worked yeah that did
147:36 - work okay that actually just worked
147:38 - somehow uh let's go in here and let's
147:44 - return the response now
147:50 - then
147:57 - data me close this oh that's better okay
148:01 - let's run now boom protected endpoint
148:05 - allowed user Tim let's go can we get
148:07 - some claps in the
148:09 - chat we uh we have now done the
148:11 - authentication other than creating an
148:13 - account but that's great we now have uh
148:15 - the user like set up and
148:19 - working only thing is I need to make it
148:21 - now so
148:22 - that just need to clean up a little bit
148:25 - of stuff here cuz obviously this is kind
148:26 - of a mess we need to clean this up uh
148:28 - the protected Endo we don't want to
148:29 - fetch like this thank you guys I'm
148:32 - looking in the chat now everyone's
148:33 - clapping appreciate it appreciate it
148:34 - thank you very much thank you very much
148:35 - I
148:37 - know okay let's actually I should
148:39 - probably just save this because like
148:41 - we're going to use that later okay now
148:44 - get rid of
148:45 - that and if data
148:50 - [Music]
148:56 - then why is this why am I getting
149:02 - this okay good
149:05 - um question should I make Yes actually I
149:09 - know the answer to this question I'm
149:10 - going to make a separate folder or
149:13 - separate file that just has uh like
149:14 - utils so
149:17 - .js and inside of here I'm going to
149:21 - Define some functions function we'll say
149:23 - send
149:25 - login
149:29 - credentials okay uh or
149:31 - actually
149:34 - um we'll say
149:37 - send
149:43 - authorized request and then this will
149:46 - take an
149:48 - endpoint take query
149:53 - actually it take pram
149:56 - string and then it will take a body okay
150:01 - so we'll say headers say body colon
150:05 - body is it body or is it data I don't
150:07 - remember and then
150:09 - endpoint
150:10 - method okay so this will be
150:14 - method and then
150:20 - okay I'm going to have to figure I'm
150:21 - going to have to remember this now okay
150:22 - end
150:25 - point then it will return
150:34 - this thoughts on the GPU Market good
150:37 - question it's actually insane and it's
150:39 - not going to get any better anytime soon
150:41 - um unfortunately I wish I could give you
150:43 - some see this isn't going to work now
150:45 - because I need to send so much stuff to
150:46 - here I think it's probably better to
150:48 - just
150:51 - yeah this isn't going to this isn't
150:53 - going to be helpful I'm going to delete
150:54 - this I don't need this um let's answer a
150:57 - few questions here do you ever work on
150:58 - electron not
151:02 - really um Rubik's time to solve it uh
151:05 - also a Rubes Cube
151:07 - shortly or I will try to solve Rubes
151:09 - Cube shortly I got I have a webcam I
151:10 - think I can use to uh to like show you
151:13 - my hands as I try to solve
151:15 - it okay for now though I'm um I'm happy
151:19 - that this somewhat working I want to be
151:20 - able to create an account though and
151:22 - then log in and I want it to redirect on
151:24 - login on successful login so if access
151:27 - token in data okay response. Json we got
151:29 - to make sure the response is okay first
151:31 - we're going to say if it should be like
151:35 - that say if uh
151:39 - response. okay then we will return the
151:43 - response. Json so return response.
151:47 - Json else we will uh set an error so set
151:53 - error of response
151:56 - do is response. error actually going to
151:58 - give me the error message I guess we'll
151:59 - see if that if that works um okay so
152:01 - this log in and then otherwise if access
152:05 - token and data set token
152:08 - else set
152:10 - error no access
152:17 - token received from server
152:22 - okay you have to sleep in 10 minutes
152:24 - please solve it I'll solve it
152:28 - soon don't worry before you go to bed I
152:30 - will uh I will I will solve the Rue for
152:33 - you will you be joining Microsoft in the
152:34 - future potentially haven't uh haven't
152:36 - really thought about it too much right
152:37 - now to be honest with
152:41 - you okay so on
152:43 - successful then we need to take props

153:57 - website so I'm looking at something else
153:59 - right now I just got to figure something
154:01 - out I can't show you this uh repository
154:03 - unfortunately it's a private
154:05 - repo
154:06 - Source app no it wouldn't be in that
154:20 - [Music]
154:34 - I'm trying to figure out how to
154:46 - redirect I remember that it's yeah what
154:50 - why is that why is that not working oh I
154:52 - remember why I got to do this like
154:54 - complicated thing here okay guys don't
154:56 - like the music again you guys oh you
154:58 - guys just complain about the music all
155:00 - the time I'm not even really listening
155:01 - to it there you go I may put a new song
155:04 - on see if you like that one better okay
155:07 - root I think I remember why this I have
155:09 - to say
155:12 - render equals and then put this here
155:21 - I think that will do that okay and
155:25 - then because this will push through
155:27 - props I think or no is that what it is I
155:32 - forget essentially there's this prop
155:34 - that will get past um called history but
155:38 - I forget how to pass the history prop um
155:41 - I'm going to look here there's a way to
155:42 - do it but I just don't remember let's
155:44 - see
155:47 - app.js Ah that's what it is okay
155:51 - and yes I am going to upload a recording
155:53 - of this whole thing after definitely
155:54 - okay I'm going to say component
155:58 - equals and then sign up ah perfect there
156:03 - you
156:04 - go then component
156:08 - equals password
156:11 - reset and then we can end
156:14 - that and then we can end that
156:20 - and
156:21 - then component
156:24 - equals
156:26 - login all right and yes nice did be a
156:29 - little Auto completion for me there okay
156:31 - now if I go to login and I go props
156:34 - history but push slash that should
156:35 - actually
156:36 - work um access token is undefined set
156:40 - data if access
156:43 - token what how is how are you going to
156:45 - tell me it's undefined when I've just
156:47 - checked if it's in it canot use in
156:49 - search for Access token in undefined in
156:53 - data oh I didn't idiot okay
157:00 - return return okay let's just do this
157:09 - return so response is not
157:17 - okay I think I just need to refresh
157:24 - this canot read property push of
157:27 - undefined why is that undefined
157:29 - shouldn't be
157:32 - undefined component login it should
157:34 - allow me to have
157:37 - that uh what is this maybe it's
157:40 - something else I'm missing here
157:41 - components
157:49 - [Music]
157:51 - yeah what the
157:52 - heck Define history use history do I
157:55 - have to do
158:10 - that use with
158:13 - router does the redirect just redirect
158:15 - cuz I want to like from code redirect
158:19 - you forgot something on log
158:26 - in now that should be fine that should
158:28 - be fine it should be pushing through a
158:31 - prop maybe it's CU I need to save
158:35 - this oh it's cuz I didn't go to the
158:37 - homepage first that's probably
158:39 - why wait let's go here okay let's go
158:44 - slash no no slash login
158:56 - history why is history wrong this should
158:58 - be this should be passing through a
159:00 - history prop history is a hook you get
159:01 - propped by doing history equals use
159:03 - history okay let me try this
159:06 - then uh
159:12 - okay where's the hook from is use
159:14 - history from react
159:21 - okay let's
159:31 - say like like that is that what you're
159:34 - saying use histories from react
159:37 - router uh react hooks must be called the
159:40 - react function
159:53 - hm like is it like use history I
160:05 - don't react router is where history is
160:09 - from this is fake he's not even Googling
160:11 - stuff A lot of times I prefer to not
160:13 - Google stuff immediately and try to
160:15 - figure it out myself let's see here
160:17 - history propped reactor router no I've
160:20 - done this before I don't know why it's
160:21 - not working
160:24 - though use router history create history
160:29 - history history.
160:33 - push like let me show you uh actually I
160:36 - can't show you I want to show you the
160:37 - code but I can't show it to you
160:39 - unfortunately um history history
160:45 - history I had it passed through as a
160:47 - prop but I don't why is this not
160:52 - working
161:09 - opponents import use history let history
161:12 - equals use history okay let's let's try
161:14 - I'm going to go with
161:17 - this up here
161:19 - move
161:22 - this do I already have a react rodom
161:27 - here yeah I do
161:36 - okay okay and then he's saying cons his
161:38 - let history equally use history
161:45 - okay okay and then
161:50 - here access token and
161:53 - data say
161:59 - history no way this
162:01 - works Tim is
162:05 - great wow okay thank you whoever who
162:08 - said that who told me that I want to
162:11 - appreciate you ant ant win ant winus ant
162:14 - winus P thank you thank you
162:20 - okay yeah I could print props too that
162:22 - would work but I guess like nothing's
162:23 - being passed through for props and I'm
162:25 - not wait I'm not using token yeah I am
162:26 - I'm using token right oh no I'm not
162:28 - using token okay
162:31 - um I want to now pass this authorization
162:36 - token so now here's the problem I need
162:38 - to store this off token now I could
162:41 - store this
162:42 - in uh like react props in fact I
162:46 - actually will do it in props but I I
162:48 - feel like it's better to put it in like
162:50 - local storage and then I can pull it out
162:51 - from anywhere so I got to figure out how
162:52 - to do that and how to create an account
162:55 - I think we'll handle create account
162:56 - first although I want to do the Rubik's
162:58 - Cube uh let me see if I can find the
162:59 - Rubik's Cube
163:05 - first
163:07 - um okay where would I put my Rubik Cube
163:10 - let me look
163:25 - not quite sure where it is
164:05 - all right got it okay I'm going to try
164:09 - to set up a yeah the theme is uh man or
164:13 - mon or whatever it is um I'm going to
164:17 - try to get my
164:19 - uh other thing here one
164:22 - sec Go video capture
164:26 - device add new
164:29 - source and this should be
164:33 - this okay
164:35 - done okay turn that down there okay can
164:39 - you guys see this I think so I'll make
164:42 - it bigger but let me just here me do
164:45 - that that should be better right
164:52 - good you guys
164:54 - see okay great uh let's move this over
164:57 - bit okay so let's just scramble her up a
165:02 - bit oh this this camera is so bad
165:05 - compared to the other one okay all right
165:08 - I haven't solved Rubik's Cube in
165:09 - genuinely like months so let's uh let's
165:12 - see if we can do it okay let me just
165:15 - make let's make sure everyone can see
165:16 - this everything everything's good
165:21 - okay
165:22 - um all right so I need to I remember I
165:25 - need to solve the cross I'm not going to
165:27 - be doing this very fast by the way uh so
165:29 - you you guys can see there I'm going to
165:31 - try to solve the Red Cross first and I
165:33 - probably shouldn't like walk you guys
165:35 - through this because it's going to take
165:36 - a really long time okay so there we
165:40 - go Blue
165:42 - [Music]
165:43 - corner and yellow
165:46 - Corner let to go
165:55 - H go that's red that's blue and where's
165:59 - my last one that's green okay we now
166:01 - have a cross a Red
166:04 - Cross and we will continue from here now
166:06 - I need to do the
166:08 - corners um okay so remember it's like
166:14 - that okay
166:21 - and where's the other
166:23 - one okay we now have one side done we
166:27 - can see our little T's here first layer
166:30 - complete I'm doing it the slow Noob way
166:33 - okay now this is where I kind of forget
166:36 - what to do I have to align the edges so
166:39 - you see these edges here uh let me see
166:40 - if I can show this okay this is the top
166:43 - and then see how like there's a blue
166:44 - edge here and there's a yellow edge here
166:46 - I need to get these edges correct okay
166:48 - okay so let's see if I can remember how
166:50 - to do this I feel like you have to hold
166:51 - it upside down for this part or maybe no
166:54 - maybe you
166:55 - don't there was there was a way to do
166:58 - this okay let's see if any edges are
167:00 - aligned
167:01 - properly now are you going to tell me
167:03 - all of them are not aligned
167:05 - properly okay how do I align the edge
167:13 - properly okay let's see if that did
167:16 - anything nice nice nice okay I did
167:19 - um H I genuinely forget how to do the
167:23 - edges does anyone know how to do the
167:24 - edges second layer second layer cube
167:27 - with Tim upside down I do hold it upside
167:30 - down yeah because these things need to
167:32 - go in but I forget how to put them in
167:35 - it's like do I line them up here I
167:38 - remember lining them up here and doing
167:40 - something with them uh okay let's try
167:44 - this oh boom got one there we go okay uh
167:47 - I know you guys can't really see much
167:49 - but I think I'm figuring it out
167:51 - now uh where's another
167:54 - Edge green okay there we go now I got it
167:57 - muscle memory is coming back
168:00 - boom and yellow no
168:05 - blue no that's not the right
168:09 - one green there you
168:13 - go
168:15 - nice okay and last egg
168:20 - looking for something doesn't have
168:22 - orange on it okay that one's
168:31 - inverted nice okay we're almost done the
168:33 - second layer just need one more Edge
168:36 - which is right
168:37 - here then it's time for the algorithms
168:39 - which I totally don't remember okay
168:41 - let's
168:43 - see boom just this left okay let's see
168:47 - what you guys are saying Tim you on Tik
168:49 - Tok no I'm not on Tik
168:51 - Tok I refuse to use Tik Tok Tik Tok is
168:54 - just even though it's like probably
168:55 - beneficial in terms of like you know my
168:57 - brand or whatever I just I hate Tik Tok
169:00 - I don't want to use Tik
169:03 - Tok oh my god I've remembered the
169:05 - algorithm I uh we're we're we're going
169:08 - to do well here I
169:09 - think if I continue to remember the
169:14 - algorithm
169:16 - okay nice okay so now I've created a
169:20 - cross on the bottom you can see most is
169:23 - done cross on the bottom now I need to
169:25 - do the next the next steps here um okay
169:29 - let's go
169:33 - here now I need to align my
169:37 - cross nice okay so now you can see that
169:40 - all of these see this and this they're
169:45 - all they're all lined so all that's left
169:46 - now is the corners the four corners now
169:49 - I could cheat and just just pull the
169:51 - cube and and turn them but uh I might do
169:54 - that under the desk who knows okay um
169:56 - now I have to remember how to do the
169:59 - corners um this is where I like always
170:02 - mess this up just remember I got this
170:04 - far guys okay remember that I made it to
170:06 - this point so that uh you know I I I I
170:09 - did
170:11 - well okay let's see here I'm not I'm not
170:14 - going to cheat I'm just saying I know
170:15 - it's like right left up left whatever
170:17 - but I have to like align the corners
170:19 - first uh left up right up left up right
170:21 - down
170:23 - okay
170:27 - um nice almost
170:28 - [Music]
170:33 - there okay so now all of the corners
170:35 - have the correct colors on them so
170:36 - they're all like yeah yeah all of them
170:39 - have the correct sides but they are not
170:41 - in the correct orientation so now I have
170:44 - to do the the crazy one the one that I
170:45 - always mess up um does someone know what
170:48 - what the last final algorithm is to do
170:50 - to place the corners the right way it's
170:53 - like RR
170:57 - something
170:59 - um R okay RP Prime D Prime R Prime
171:03 - D um cuz I actually completely forget
171:07 - this I want to I want to practice it on
171:09 - a cube that's not partly solved
171:13 - um it's like R let's see
171:20 - oh see I've I've messed it up I've
171:22 - messed it up oh no okay uh going to have
171:24 - to just insert the correct edge here and
171:26 - then I think I will be okay damn it we
171:29 - were we were so
171:32 - close oh no we're back we're back at the
171:34 - beginning now guys okay
171:46 - um oh no okay we're we're going to have
171:49 - to yeah we're going to have to to go
171:50 - from the beginning cuz I well not from
171:52 - the very beginning but from close enough
171:55 - to the beginning that it's going to be
171:58 - annoying CU I've I've messed it up okay
172:01 - um
172:19 - no that one's no good this one is
172:24 - though
172:30 - okay
172:33 - okay and okay see I'm going a bit faster
172:38 - now cuz now I know these ones
172:49 - okay um we did we did pretty well I've
172:51 - got all of them except three corners now
172:55 - um so you can see that's all good I
172:57 - genuinely don't know the last algorithm
172:59 - that's going to be I'm going to keep
173:00 - doing this so many
173:03 - times um will Kobe post on GitHub yeah
173:06 - yeah after I'll put everything on
173:08 - GitHub the auto correct what what's
173:10 - wrong with the auto correct IO it's this
173:13 - one R Prime D Prime RP Prime R RP Prime
173:17 - D Prime r d hm actually ready I'm I'm
173:22 - going to bring a a guest on stream that
173:25 - that's going to solve it for me okay
173:26 - ready yeah I'll be back in one sec I'm
173:28 - going to leave the screen open
174:04 - okay I've got a guest on the stream here
174:06 - this is my brother he'll introduce
174:10 - himself hey guys how's it going I'm Noah
174:12 - Tim's brother I hear you need some help
174:14 - solving the cube this the camera by the
174:16 - way that's the one that's doing like
174:18 - okay
174:19 - okay
174:21 - jeez they can see it right yeah yeah
174:23 - they can see it
174:27 - okay and there you go
174:33 - Tada there you go guys how how'd you
174:35 - like that where's the
174:38 - Cat fresa come
174:47 - here yeah no
174:49 - problem yeah no yeah people I uh mistake
174:53 - us as like twins we're actually not
174:54 - twins okay let me turn this off there
174:57 - you
175:01 - go my my cat may be coming in the room
175:03 - we'll see though the cat is smarter than
175:04 - Tim yeah
175:06 - probably is she
175:09 - here oh you have
175:11 - food come here
175:19 - she's she can't jump that high come here
175:21 - come
175:26 - here come
175:33 - here can you guys see the cat let's see
175:36 - uh let me turn on the other the other
175:39 - camera there you
175:42 - go sorry it's looking down no I know
175:45 - it's it's on purpose
175:49 - there you go that that's Fresco for you
175:51 - is your brother El a pro in coding no he
175:53 - knows how to code but he's not a
175:55 - pro there you are
176:00 - fresa I gave her uh some food that's why
176:03 - she
176:03 - came yeah I get hair over my desk all
176:06 - the time it's it's okay I'm used to it
176:11 - Nowa what are you
176:15 - doing there you go she's gone now she
176:17 - just wanted the food
176:20 - or is she going to hang out on my desk
176:22 - we'll see you guys will see her tail
176:23 - flying around in the background who's
176:25 - the older brother I'm the older
176:28 - brother uh okay that we get back to Cody
176:31 - now that was a good break that was that
176:33 - was entertaining I feel
176:37 - like let fresa do some ASMR I guess you
176:40 - guys didn't hear her um what do you call
176:43 - it uh like purring or whatever I
176:46 - literally see a brother come in sit down
176:47 - pick up the Cube and then I look down
176:49 - and get some chicken and look back and
176:50 - he's done yeah my brother is like a
176:51 - speed cuber he used to do competitions
176:54 - um he's like really good at at Rubik
176:56 - Cube it's like super impressive he did
176:58 - like the Triangular ones the like
177:00 - hexagonal ones the like 5x5 6x6 I don't
177:03 - know what his record time is I think it
177:04 - was like 15 seconds for the 3X3 maybe
177:06 - even shorter um but
177:10 - yeah she is smart she knows what she
177:12 - want yeah exactly frus is
177:15 - smart all right okay hopefully hopefully
177:17 - you guys enjoyed that that entertainment
177:19 - there I'll definitely I'll try to time
177:20 - stamp that on the recording of the
177:21 - stream oh excuse me okay what was I
177:25 - doing um it's making it redirect back
177:28 - home okay so let's go slash
177:32 - login nice it takes a long time to load
177:36 - you know what that's fine um see what
177:39 - everyone else is saying when do you
177:41 - expect to finish coding at 11:00 p.m.
177:43 - EST tonight collab with Ben Awad yeah I
177:46 - would be down to do that go go spam Ben
177:49 - and tell him to do a collab with
177:52 - me this mug is called Ember it's a
177:55 - reheatable coffee mug it's really cool I
177:57 - don't know actually I it was given to me
177:58 - as a gift I actually don't know um where
178:00 - to go yeah same thing with kale if you
178:02 - guys want me to collab with these guys
178:03 - just uh like spam them and tell them to
178:05 - to email me or something I mean I could
178:06 - email them too I guess but uh you should
178:08 - create a GitHub repo and use read me
178:10 - stats I don't know what that is history
178:12 - error doesn't look like I'm getting a
178:14 - history
178:15 - error um have you seen Ben's newest
178:17 - project projects I've seen a few of the
178:19 - thing I've just like I don't watch his
178:20 - videos but I've seen the like headlines
178:22 - of them they're doing really well he has
178:24 - uh what something to do with like
178:26 - Dogecoin or something or Doge Doge house
178:28 - or something like that
178:32 - um damn okay I want to keep answering
178:34 - chat but I also need to do um some
178:38 - coding here presco you here you guys
178:41 - can't see her but she's on the ground
178:45 - [Music]
178:51 - [Music]
178:59 - oh look catch is coming back up on the
179:02 - desk special treat ground equals best
179:05 - bed yeah for cats pretty
179:07 - much oh and here she is she's definitely
179:09 - going to obstruct my uh what do you call
179:11 - it we can turn on the cat cam I'll make
179:13 - it
179:15 - small if I uh unlock
179:18 - get your tail out of my face
179:26 - okay we'll put it there for when she
179:31 - comes okay boom all right
179:37 - um I keep forgetting what I'm going to
179:39 - do this is the problem with streaming
179:40 - right it's cuz like you get distracted
179:42 - so easily and then like all of your
179:43 - train of thought like you can't get into
179:45 - the flow state right um okay so let's
179:50 - make it so we can sign it so I want to
179:52 - go
179:53 - to My
179:55 - Views and to sign up and here I want to
180:00 - do very similar thing to
180:04 - this so sign up can actually call sign
180:07 - in to get the token
180:10 - or we could just create the token hey
180:18 - there you go you guys can see her now um
180:21 - okay so distracted sign up username
180:26 - password that's
180:28 - good uh we want email as well email
180:32 - equals uh request.get
180:37 - email
180:39 - none comma
180:41 - none and then I want password
180:46 - one password 2al request.get
180:52 - password
180:54 - 2 and
180:56 - none okay and what else do we want here
181:01 - authenticate user password we can't do
181:03 - that right
181:05 - now we can't do that right
181:09 - now need to check if this account exists
181:11 - so
181:12 - if H we'll say
181:26 - filter by usern no filter
181:31 - by email uh user
181:35 - uncore email
181:40 - exist okay and then we'll
181:46 - do actually just do
181:55 - this filter
181:58 - by and then username oh this should be
182:02 - email equals email and username equals
182:07 - username do
182:10 - exist okay and then oops and then we
182:13 - will
182:15 - say if email
182:19 - underscore
182:21 - exists then we're going to return a
182:25 - response here and this will say what is
182:29 - this response access to this will
182:31 - say
182:38 - error emails already in use okay and
182:42 - then Response
182:45 - Code what's the response to that 400 bad
182:48 - request yeah we do 400 that's fine watch
182:51 - hey watch okay
182:55 - if username exists
182:59 - say username is
183:03 - taken please try
183:06 - another and
183:08 - 400 okay and then we'll check the
183:11 - passwords we'll say if password one does
183:14 - not equal password 2 then what we want
183:17 - to do is
183:20 - return
183:22 - error and we'll say passwords do not
183:27 - match this needs to be a colon sponse
183:31 - code I know 400 is probably the wrong
183:33 - one but we with now we'll go for that um
183:36 - let's see what you guys are saying here
183:37 - keyboard sounds awesome appreciate that
183:40 - uh exists spelling wrong username is
183:43 - taken email is already in use
183:45 - uh exists I think I'm sing exists
183:48 - correctly oh looks like the cat is gone
183:50 - she has left us I'll turn off the cat
183:52 - cam or she's going to hang out on the
183:54 - stool we'll see okay uh email exists
183:58 - username exists password so if the
183:59 - passwords are correct the email doesn't
184:01 - exist and uh the username doesn't exist
184:03 - then we're good we can actually create
184:05 - the account so I'm going to say user
184:07 - equals user and then we need to modify
184:10 - the user model actually uh so we have
184:12 - username password we need email as
184:14 - well say email
184:18 - equals db. colum db. text un equals true
184:21 - yep so username email password ID is
184:24 - active Okay and we'll say user username
184:29 - equals username email equals email
184:32 - password equals password one okay and
184:36 - then how do I actually add this to the
184:39 - database oh I'm like slightly allergic
184:41 - to the cat I think every time she comes
184:43 - by I get like a little itchy whenever
184:44 - I'm patting her and then I touch my face
184:46 - or my eyes or whatever it's okay it's
184:48 - worth it I'll survive uh how do we do
184:51 - this
184:52 - here db. create all with app.app context
184:56 - do I need the app
184:59 - context
185:01 - maybe CU then I need to import app
185:04 - from I won't be able to use app context
185:06 - I think I can do it just like this I
185:08 - don't think I need the app context I I
185:10 - don't usually use the app
185:11 - context okay let's go here db.
185:15 - create db. session
185:18 - no I don't need
185:23 - that ah I do need this though okay
185:30 - crap db. session. add and then this will
185:34 - be user db. session. commit nice and
185:39 - then user equals guard. authenticate
185:42 - username
185:43 - password think that should be good and
185:46 - then we can do that okay nice and then
185:48 - this will be 2011 because we created a
185:50 - new account now let's see though cuz
185:54 - they're going to get an issue here if I
185:56 - go to
185:58 - views log
186:00 - in see this need to say
186:04 - email email and then this would be
186:08 - email ah damn it I'm going to have to
186:10 - change the authentication field to be
186:12 - email rather than user

193:58 - in where are we calling this ex
194:02 - token else
194:05 - okay

194:35 - in what is what is going to be in data I
194:37 - want to print data okay
194:40 - console.log data
194:43 - okay just nothing just gives me nothing
194:48 - okay let's do
194:50 - this and
194:52 - say R 200 login
194:59 - H access token access token won't be in
195:03 - there okay I'm going say if
195:08 - R I guess when it authenticates it
195:12 - sends H okay no access token received
195:15 - from server rather than that let's just
195:16 - say
195:18 - invalid login and then if there is an
195:20 - error we'll display the error but I
195:21 - don't think we'll get that invalid login
195:23 - okay that's fine invalid
195:25 - login please try again okay let's work
195:30 - on the signup page now that's kind of
195:32 - all that's like working enough it's
195:33 - working well enough for me let's go to
195:36 - sign
195:37 - up
195:39 - okay default
195:43 - request email
195:47 - username

196:30 - create account uh oh I need the the use
196:33 - history hook okay let's go
196:37 - here oh and
196:39 - token
196:41 - H okay we're going to figure out where
196:43 - to store the token after this
196:48 - and then use histories from react
196:53 - router okay
197:05 - nice okay sign up inval
197:08 - login internal server error
197:23 - oh okay I thought exists gave me the
197:26 - variable name has an error in it email
197:28 - exists store tokens and cookies in local
197:30 - storage anyone can change yeah I know
197:32 - but um sort an httv only cookie so you
197:35 - won't have to mess with it in JavaScript
197:36 - okay that's a good idea
197:38 - actually
197:41 - um I'm not like super concerned about
197:44 - the security of this
197:45 - application because I'm not like a
197:48 - security expert I just want it to work
197:50 - and then I can like deal with security
197:52 - after okay so that was on the back end
197:54 - we're getting an error there and we
197:56 - still get that invalid login
197:59 - um so that's cuzz I guess no error was
198:03 - returned yeah okay that's fine so let me
198:05 - just change this go
198:07 - quickly uh an error urage okay well
198:09 - we'll just do
198:14 - that okay log in now View

203:36 - implement that too oh God that's going
203:38 - to be
203:39 - annoying okay so now we got to figure
203:43 - out where we want to store the token how
203:46 - how we're going to refresh the token and
203:49 - all that fun
203:54 - stuff
203:56 - okay first though we can make the
203:59 - homepage we can make it see if we can
204:01 - get like the user's name or something
204:03 - right um yeah let's do that let let's
204:05 - make an endpoint we don't need this like
204:08 - test protected one anymore we can call
204:10 - this um get user data or something yeah
204:14 - get user data and then this will be uh
204:20 - get user data and then we will send the
204:23 - authorization token okay we don't need
204:27 - this and what we will do is return
204:31 - something that looks like this let's go
204:32 - full screen
204:33 - here we're going to
204:35 - say
204:38 - data and
204:42 - then yeah uh do current user
204:48 - do username what else would this have
204:50 - this would have email as well so we'll
204:52 - we'll pass that and email we'll say data
204:55 - and then this will be a
204:57 - dictionary and then this will
205:00 - be uh username and then this will
205:06 - be
205:08 - email okay let's make this look a little
205:10 - bit
205:12 - nicer actually that's going to go like
205:15 - that
205:22 - okay nice okay uh I definitely messed
205:26 - that up but let's try that now get user
205:30 - data now what I'm actually going to
205:34 - do is I'm going to for now store the
205:39 - token in my app
205:41 - component so yeah use effect we want we
205:45 - also want use state
205:47 - I'm going to
205:48 - say con
205:51 - token set token I'm going to do this
205:53 - with a call back you guys going to see
205:55 - this is probably really bad to do but
205:57 - it'll work for now okay set token and
206:01 - then comma set token and we're going to
206:04 - say use effect check token yeah
206:09 - okay wait no it's not where I want this
206:14 - okay component render here
206:18 - H okay I got to look at something I want
206:21 - the token here this is what I can do
206:22 - though I could
206:24 - say
206:33 - const let's see here how do I want to do
206:39 - this okay
206:45 - um I need to look at some code here
206:48 - where's my Sublime
206:51 - Text
206:54 - homepage this is what I want to
207:02 - do so these Pages don't yeah know these
207:05 - Pages do need the call back actually
207:07 - let's see here
207:18 - this is going to
207:20 - be log
207:24 - in set token there we go okay and let's
207:27 - be set token okay what I'm doing is
207:30 - passing a call back um and what this
207:32 - call back will do is allow me to set the
207:34 - token in here from the uh the login page
207:38 - and then I will pass the token to any uh
207:41 - page I'm rendering that requires it okay
207:43 - this is good good good very good okay
207:48 - render then sign
207:53 - up then react path component
207:59 - okay uh this won't need password reset
208:03 - that can stay the way it is right now uh
208:05 - sign up sign
208:07 - up token okay very good log
208:11 - in now when we set token we're going to
208:14 - say Pro pops. set token we don't need to
208:17 - store it
208:19 - here okay great and then same thing
208:24 - here this is going to be
208:27 - props on set token this needs to take
208:32 - props and then we can remove the token
208:37 - State
208:39 - okay uh what are you guys saying please
208:41 - don't destroy it
208:47 - it's okay after you write code you have

210:24 - call this main
210:26 - UI and then in here new file call
210:31 - this homepage. JS okay let's copy all
210:35 - that let's go to homepage we don't need
210:38 - any of
210:39 - this okay and then we're going to assume
210:42 - a token is passed to us props let's call
210:45 - this home
210:49 - page okay and then we will
210:53 - say use
210:56 - effect
211:00 - Fetch and then we will
211:03 - fetch what's it going to
211:06 - be get user
211:11 - data yeah yeah SL API SLG get user data
211:16 - do
211:17 - then do
211:20 - then
211:21 - okay so I can get messaged
211:26 - here all right what's everyone saying
211:28 - here okay uh what I'm doing is I'm now
211:30 - creating a homepage so what uh let's
211:32 - let's run through what I've done here uh
211:34 - I have the signup page and the login
211:36 - page working good functioning awesome
211:40 - and what's happening is they are setting
211:42 - the authentication token right here and
211:45 - there setting it on app Dodge ass now by
211:48 - doing that that allows me to pass that
211:50 - token to every other component so now
211:53 - what I can do is render homepage pass
211:55 - that token through and then that
211:57 - homepage can use the token to send an
211:58 - authenticated uh request and if you
212:01 - don't sign in uh then you won't be able
212:03 - to send a request or you will but it
212:04 - will fail and so you'll see what I mean
212:06 - in a second uh but the first thing I
212:08 - want to do is try to get uh the users's
212:11 - data now I made an endpoint in views
212:14 - here I said get user dat data and this
212:17 - is going to return the user's data if
212:18 - you're authenticated and so I want to
212:19 - test that so I'm doing that homepage so
212:21 - I'm saying API get user
212:23 - data however I need to go here copy
212:28 - this
212:31 - and go like that remove the body I don't
212:36 - need this header I just need
212:41 - authorization and this will be get
212:43 - request and then this will be
212:48 - eror
212:50 - plus props do
212:53 - token token's not in there yet but it
212:55 - will be and then this is going to be
212:58 - request
213:00 - options and that needs to end there okay
213:05 - then it will
213:06 - say
213:09 - response response.
213:13 - Json okay do then
213:18 - data console.log data come on auto
213:21 - format for me give me the nice formation
213:23 - okay format document with prettier why
213:26 - is it not
213:27 - formatting should be formatting there
213:30 - you go
213:33 - and there you go oh it's cuz I'm not
213:36 - returning anything that's why okay and
213:37 - then we're going to return a div and
213:40 - this div is just going to
213:42 - say um it's going to say con
213:51 - username
213:53 - set

218:03 - the chat right now what is better for
218:06 - starting JavaScript or python I'm trying
218:07 - to make games JavaScript would probably
218:09 - be better although you can make games in
218:10 - Python too if you're just starting it's
218:11 - not really a big deal uh they're they're
218:13 - fairly similar I know I would recommend
218:16 - python but I'm biased I like python I
218:18 - use Python for a lot of stuff but
218:19 - JavaScript really cool too like you
218:21 - can't do what I'm doing here in Python
218:22 - uh this UI uh well you could but it just
218:24 - would be like a lot more
218:27 - difficult okay typography just doing a
218:30 - quick check
218:31 - here I think that's
218:35 - good now we need to render
218:39 - homepage say
218:42 - import homepage from dot SL
218:46 - homepage although this is in main
218:50 - UI main ui/ homepage and then we're

225:13 - border which is kind of annoying but we
225:15 - can live with this the reason I lost the
225:17 - border is cuz it's on my server and the
225:19 - servers I guess it's IP address changed
225:24 - um why does this keep lagging why is
225:26 - this camera lagging it's it's something
225:28 - in in um in streamlabs I'm going to go

227:28 - frozen it's it's uh streamlabs but the
227:31 - thing is I really I don't want to stop
227:33 - the stream because if I stop it I think
227:35 - it's going to um it's going to end the
227:38 - stream entirely and I don't I can't end
227:39 - this because if I end this it's not

227:43 - want to have to like render 12 12 hours
227:45 - of footage after uh how do I go to the
227:49 - like stuff here go live I don't think

228:28 - freezing
228:31 - uh can I pause the
228:36 - stream see if this works
228:46 - test test yep I know you guys are fine
228:48 - with the cam but I want a camera um I
228:51 - don't think it's the camera that's
228:52 - freezing I think it's the entire screen
228:54 - uh so yeah see CU be right even this is
228:57 - is freezing without the camera I need to
229:00 - stop this and then restart it
229:04 - uh okay let's just press

229:43 - e for
230:26 - okay I know you guys can hear me I'm I'm
230:28 - uh what is it I'm trying to figure this
230:30 - out I just want to make sure that if I
230:32 - end the stream on streamlabs it won't I
230:34 - can reconnect to it uh I'm going to just
230:38 - like re I want to make sure I don't
230:39 - accidentally end it um too too
230:41 - prematurely here um although I did
230:44 - disconnect and I was able to reconnect
230:46 - but I just I I fear I'm going to press
230:49 - stop stream here and then it's going to
230:52 - um it's going to
230:55 - freeze so let's see here
230:58 - stream YouTube output

231:43 - not confident though
231:50 - okay
231:51 - okay am I
231:55 - back no one
231:58 - knows uh yeah okay back back I started I
232:05 - restarted streamlabs um I think that's
232:07 - going to fix it again I'm so sorry guys
232:10 - man I literally was sitting in the
232:11 - Stream and all of a sudden just boom I

232:24 - battery backup uh UPS so all of my data
232:26 - was saved I didn't lose anything the
232:28 - stream stopped because the internet
232:30 - stopped but the UPS kept running my PC
232:32 - it just all the monitors turned off but
232:34 - the PC was still running so I think I
232:37 - fixed it I think it was just streamlabs

232:40 - border back and I'm just going to keep
232:42 - talking really low res the res should
232:45 - fix itself that it should get better

235:04 - my girlfriend messaged me and my entire
235:06 - office exploded stream stopped and I
235:09 - couldn't do anything until I responded
235:11 - um yeah that that's what happened fire
235:13 - went up and blazed
235:15 - and then uh the sprinkler system went on
235:17 - yeah um all right let's see I think I
235:21 - think we're good I think we're good that
235:24 - doesn't count as a brick trust me I was
235:26 - not on brick when that was happening
235:28 - okay I think we're good
235:32 - uh all
235:34 - right all right yep yep looks good okay
235:39 - sorry we're back all right what was I
235:41 - doing I honestly don't remember remember
235:44 - uh I was testing the sign up log in so I
235:48 - do need to verify that the email people
235:50 - are typing in is correct so I would like
235:53 - to do that like I want to verify that
235:55 - the email is actually an email um but I
235:59 - don't really want them to have to like
236:00 - verify their email you know I would
236:02 - prefer to just like be able to make an
236:04 - account so let's do this
236:10 - um email validator python
236:16 - okay uh how to check for valid email
236:21 - address okay update here's how you could
236:24 - use a
236:27 - [Music]
236:32 - regx okay let's just see if there's an
236:35 - easy way to do an email verification
236:36 - because I think I need to do that
236:38 - email
236:41 - verification flask
236:44 - you have a typo on
236:46 - passwords um okay we'll look at that
236:53 - after real python this good website this
236:55 - guy does really good work update the
236:57 - current
236:58 - APP
237:00 - confirmed oh that's what you have to do
237:02 - okay registered
237:04 - confirmed I actually should probably do
237:06 - registered on too that would be a good
237:08 - field to have okay so
237:11 - confirmed manage command conf
237:18 - confirmed generate confirmation
237:21 - token the email confirmation should
237:23 - contain a unique URL that a user simply
237:25 - needs to click in order to confirm his
237:26 - account ideally the URL should look
237:27 - something like the key here is the ID
237:29 - you're going to encode the user email
237:32 - along with a timestamp in the ID using
237:35 - its dangerous package create a file
237:37 - called project token. piy let just see
237:40 - what we're going to do here so in the
237:42 - generate confirmation token function we
237:44 - use your all safe timed serializer
237:47 - generate
237:48 - token okay uh user blueprint. root okay
237:52 - form.
237:54 - validate token generate confirmation
237:57 - token handle email
237:59 - confirmation surely it's got to be an
238:01 - easier way to do this okay uh use it
238:04 - confirmed you've confirmed your account
238:06 - when you go to that route
238:11 - okay okay okay okay create the email
238:13 - template
238:15 - okay I think I can do
238:17 - this it's going to be a pain to be
238:20 - honest with you but we got to do it so
238:22 - let's do it okay
238:25 - so good if they try to sign in and they
238:29 - are not uh verified we need to send them
238:33 - something to say please verify your
238:34 - email okay so we'll say actually let's
238:37 - modify the user model
238:38 - first is my music not going oh the
238:41 - music's not going sorry about that guys
238:44 - let me get that
238:46 - working
238:50 - okay
238:58 - um let me find the
239:12 - music there was one wondering where that
239:14 - went okay lowfy music should start
239:18 - playing soon sweet turn that down a bit
239:27 - okay why doesn't Tim know how to set
239:29 - slow mode it's a good question I have no
239:32 - idea I should know how to do that man I
239:34 - just uh I can't for some reason it's
239:36 - just not just not working just doesn't
239:38 - let me do
239:39 - it there's like no button to set the
239:41 - slow mode thing which is weird
239:44 - okay send
239:46 - email man this is a lot of work to send
239:49 - the
239:50 - email okay we've done registration but I
239:53 - do want all of that so let's go to
240:01 - AIT
240:04 - and registered
240:06 - on confirmed
240:09 - on AC okay
240:12 - good I don't need that a nit that's
240:16 - fine notice how file defaults to
240:20 - false manage
240:24 - command okay so when we add this guy
240:29 - going to go like that and delete this
240:33 - database let's
240:35 - actually
240:40 - delete okay
240:44 - I think this is is this showing me how
240:45 - to do it in Django I think it is but I
240:47 - don't think it makes a difference
240:48 - actually no no it's floss what am I Ty
240:50 - that okay that's good so now when I
240:56 - create let's go here should have a
240:59 - default right default equals false
241:01 - registered
241:03 - on can I make that auto
241:08 - insert yeah that should Auto insert
241:11 - confirmed on okay see import day
241:14 - [Music]
241:26 - time okay now where's create
241:31 - user we're going to say
241:40 - user confirmed equals false
241:50 - generate confirmation token
242:03 - okay so far we've done literally nothing
242:06 - related to uh to the actual code racer
242:09 - thing we've literally just been trying
242:11 - to set up authentication because I
242:14 - ideally want this to work properly okay
242:16 - so there you
242:19 - go be sure to add security password to
242:21 - your apps
242:22 - config
242:24 - um where is it saying security password
242:27 - so app.config
242:30 - okay let's do
242:34 - that
242:40 - um security password salt equals
242:45 - random thing you'll never guess okay um
242:51 - what else does we need no that's
242:53 - it
242:55 - register
242:57 - confirmed token
243:00 - okay
243:02 - fuse and
243:05 - user turn access token no see we can't
243:08 - return the access token because they're
243:12 - not confirmed yet so
243:19 - what should we do here after that's
243:23 - successful we'll
243:25 - say
243:30 - success yeah okay actually let me fix
243:37 - this I'm going to say
243:39 - return we'll just return empty response
243:41 - to A1 let's say
243:46 - data oh we need to return the link
243:49 - that's what we need to do
243:50 - okay uh from project. token
243:56 - import
243:58 - from.
244:00 - token import generate confirmation token
244:07 - okay okay now I actually need a
244:10 - rout yeah okay this is going to be kind
244:12 - of complicated so at
244:15 - views.
244:18 - root
244:20 - confirm
244:22 - email
244:25 - slash
244:27 - token
244:29 - okay Define confirm unor
244:34 - email token guess I can
244:39 - authenticate H this is where it's tough
244:42 - here so I need to confirm the email
244:44 - before I let a user sign
244:50 - in okay generate confirmation
244:54 - token so I guess we can check if the
244:57 - user
244:58 - is signed in before we do this okay so
245:01 - I'm going to
245:02 - say user equals oh there you go it does

342:08 - great we're good wait an error occurred
342:10 - what 401 unauthorized what is local
342:20 - storage how does local storage work cuz
342:22 - that didn't like grab the token out of
342:29 - it uh let's go to
342:50 - nothing yeah but shouldn't the shouldn't
342:52 - it not clear the
342:55 - storage wait let me go to app maybe it's
342:57 - cuz I did
342:58 - this it's CU maybe the state gets reset
343:02 - okay we can do this we can say
343:06 - if window. local
343:11 - storage I need to look this up I forget
343:13 - how this
343:26 - works that sets the local storage and
343:29 - then I guess it would reset the local
343:31 - storage when the state refreshed oh that
343:34 - makes sense okay um
343:38 - okay we can do this that's fine if uh
343:40 - window. local storage
343:45 - dot get it
343:54 - token right now I'm trying to store the
343:56 - token in local
343:57 - storage and um once that's done like all
344:01 - the off stuff's done there's nothing
344:02 - more to do um if you take that long I'd
344:05 - take a century
344:07 - yeah I don't know I just also like start
344:09 - I'm trying to do something like pretty
344:10 - complicated
344:11 - right uh or if it does equal

345:03 - do that through react on the front end
345:05 - uh we could do a back end as well we we
345:07 - will do two um okay I'm going to be back

348:47 - state or some provinces 18 um most is
348:55 - 19
348:57 - okay what age I start coding so around
349:01 - 12 maybe a little bit earlier than that
349:03 - I it's really hard to remember to be
349:04 - honest but probably yeah around like 12
349:08 - so actually what I'm going to do is
349:14 - make a sign out and all the sign out's
349:16 - going to do is send request sign out on
349:18 - the back end then redirect to the login
349:20 - page that'll be pretty easy uh let's do
349:22 - that
349:29 - now

356:27 - MVP been here listening in the
356:29 - background musty appreciate
356:31 - it why don't use fast API yeah I
356:33 - probably should have used that to be
356:34 - honest
356:37 - don't overexert yourself take care man I
356:39 - appreciate that but I only do these like
356:41 - once in a while so it's okay we can we
356:42 - can go crazy um so logging
356:47 - out I don't actually think there's
356:49 - anything we need to do on the back end
356:51 - to log out now that I think about
356:53 - it cuz it's just a
356:57 - token I don't think we need to like log
356:59 - the user
357:01 - out yeah I genuinely don't think we need
357:03 - a back end for this I think we can just
357:05 - do on the R cuz we just removed the
357:07 - token yeah that sounds about right I
357:10 - don't need all
357:11 - this I can just remove the token from
357:13 - local
357:16 - storage and then literally push the
357:18 - login page yeah let's do
357:27 - that okay how do you remove from local
357:31 - storage uh delete from local storage
357:39 - JavaScript remove
357:43 - item oh I'm getting a a phone call okay
357:46 - one sec guys I'll be right back
358:59 - all right I'm coming back sorry I was
359:02 - told that uh I was able to go buy an
359:05 - Xbox now I put myself on a weit list
359:07 - like 2 months ago to buy a new Xbox just
359:09 - cuz like I might as well just put myself
359:10 - on I don't have to buy it if I don't
359:12 - want to and they said hey we have one
359:13 - available so I was like okay that's like
359:14 - I don't even know what it's called the
359:15 - series X or something whatever the new
359:17 - one
359:19 - is but yeah that's what they told me
359:24 - okay are you ever going to make a python
359:26 - Advanced tutorial and teach us about
359:28 - packages probably I have mentioned
359:29 - packages in a tutorial
359:33 - before client side logging out sounds
359:35 - sketch the thing is it's like you need a
359:39 - token to send to the back end so all I'm
359:41 - doing when I'm logging out is just
359:43 - removing the token from local storage so
359:45 - it's not like you're like cashed in the
359:46 - back end as if you're logged in just
359:48 - anytime a request is sent you have to be
359:51 - you have to have that token for the
359:52 - request to like work right now once we
359:55 - get to
359:57 - sockets that's going to be interesting
359:59 - uh that's could be very
360:01 - interesting because like hm
360:06 - yeah I guess actually it won't really
360:08 - matter
360:09 - because oh this will be great but now
360:11 - the way it's going to work is you will
360:12 - be able to play as a guest or signed in
360:15 - and if you're playing as a guest that
360:17 - just means you won't be able to like
360:19 - have your score saved and everything
360:20 - you'll just you'll be able to play but
360:22 - you won't have to like save your score
360:24 - uh whereas if you are logged in yeah I'm
360:27 - using JWT um yeah okay this actually
360:29 - this will work this will
360:33 - work okay so all we're going to do is
360:35 - just remove this from local storage if
360:37 - we're in local storage got to make sure
360:38 - we check that so I'm going to say will
360:40 - this work if it's not in local
360:43 - storage like does it handle that or will
360:45 - it
360:50 - crash I mean I guess I can just check if
360:52 - it's in local storage we'll we'll try it
360:55 - for now I think that's fine um and then
360:57 - it should this should just log you out
360:59 - so let's is this called No this be
361:02 - called log yet
361:06 - okay export
361:08 - default log
361:10 - out okay and just just to clarify here I
361:14 - not at all recommending you guys do what
361:15 - I'm doing here this is me like figuring
361:17 - stuff out as we go just trying to make
361:19 - something work this is more just for fun
361:21 - like this is not to like this is not a
361:22 - tutorial please please don't take this
361:24 - as a tutorial otherwise uh yeah that's
361:27 - just that's going to be bad okay let's
361:29 - go log
361:31 - out and then we
361:33 - will rout
361:39 - slash log out
361:42 - and log out although I
361:48 - will no actually I think this is fine I
361:51 - think we'll be
362:04 - okay okay see if this works so I'm
362:07 - signed in right now if my API is
362:11 - running should be signed in there you go
362:14 - so now if I go to slash sign
362:17 - out or slash log out notice it logs me
362:22 - out boom brings me back to login page
362:24 - all right now if I go to
362:27 - home see error occurred please try sign
362:29 - again awesome okay so now we can
362:32 - actually start creating the application
362:34 - now we can sign in and sign out and do
362:36 - all of that annoying stuff and so we can
362:37 - remove all this we can start working on
362:39 - the actual user interface this is like
362:42 - actually kind of perfect exactly halfway
362:44 - all the hard stuff's done now I'm not
362:46 - saying the new stuff we're doing is not
362:47 - going to be difficult but it will be a
362:49 - lot easier and I'm going to rename this
362:51 - file
362:52 - off just because uh that handles all the
362:55 - off roots and now I'm going to go to a
362:57 - nit CU I got to change my other my other
362:58 - views
362:59 - here uh this is going to
363:03 - be
363:04 - off
363:07 - off
363:09 - off
363:10 - [Music]
363:18 - fuse come on you're not going to
363:28 - rename there you go okay that should
363:31 - still work
363:34 - now good got it nice all right refresh
363:38 - get user data so this needs to go into a
363:40 - different
363:42 - file go
363:46 - new sub UI now we go to
363:54 - nit
364:00 - and use
364:12 - uh SL API yeah this can still be SL API
364:16 - that's fine uh okay now
364:19 - off take
364:21 - that go to
364:24 - fuse paste off
364:37 - don't think I need that don't think I
364:39 - need that don't think I need
364:43 - that don't need that might need that

372:08 - don't think I have a Domino's close to
372:09 - me though that would be so
372:16 - funny uh is there some reason you use
372:18 - Windows instead of Linux um honestly the
372:20 - reason I use Windows just because most
372:21 - people use Windows and it's easier to uh
372:25 - to use an operating system than most
372:26 - people are using right like 90% of
372:27 - people that are watching my tutorials
372:29 - are on windows so it just makes s or Mac
372:32 - but it like I'm not going to use Mac
372:33 - just cuz I can't build my own Mac or I
372:35 - could but like I can't get the kind of
372:37 - power I want in a Mac and so I use
372:39 - Windows and then I have a Mac you guys
372:41 - can actually you can't see it cuz I cut
372:43 - my webcam off but it's over there um
372:45 - anyways I have a dual boot into a buntu
372:48 - I just I don't know like video gaming
372:50 - like all that kind of stuff like it just
372:51 - doesn't work that well on a bun to like
372:52 - development sure but it's not that much
372:55 - better so okay my food is uh is being
372:58 - ordered right now I was going to use
372:59 - typescript with a setup which just too
373:00 - annoying so I figured just I'm not going
373:02 - to use
373:03 - it okay let me take take all
373:08 - this and let me return
373:16 - this and then we're going to return the
373:18 - function called to render
373:24 - router uh inside of a
373:28 - [Music]
373:32 - div that should work right
373:37 - good okay I need a nav

374:50 - ones all water cooled I've got like 12
374:53 - fans or something stupid um
374:59 - yeah and some like ridiculous
375:01 - motherboard too cuz when I was buying my
375:03 - PC was like just before all the opponent
375:05 - shortages but motherboards especially
375:07 - x570 boards were really out of stock so
375:10 - I literally spent ,000 on a uh Godlike
375:13 - motherboard MSI Godlike because that was
375:16 - the only one I could get that was better
375:17 - than like a $200 motherboard all the
375:20 - other ones that were like $300 $400 that
375:21 - I wanted to spend were out of stock so I
375:23 - had to go with that I didn't have to I
375:25 - could have waited but I didn't want to
375:27 - wait okay app bar nice control someone
375:32 - someone told me how to import this
375:36 - but I don't know and I got to find all
375:37 - the Imports
375:39 - now okay let's view the source code no
375:43 - show the full there you go that's what I
375:45 - wanted to
375:45 - see
375:53 - okay already have
375:55 - typography classes is not
375:59 - defined all right we can just uh copy
376:03 - their Styles that's that's fine too
376:05 - to
376:13 - okay oh did I not import make
376:19 - Styles there you
376:21 - go Control Plus space auto complete then
376:24 - select what you want control plus space
376:26 - isn't doing anything it's not
376:27 - working like control play oh wait
376:32 - loading yeah but it I don't know anyways
376:34 - didn't look like it was working make
376:37 - Styles oh I need the that variable
376:41 - oops there you
376:44 - go see this is what a pro professional
376:47 - programmer looks like copying and
376:49 - pasting and uh just just hoping stuff
376:52 - works look at this beautifulness look at
376:56 - this we've got the nav bar this doesn't
376:58 - do anything that's great we got news we
377:01 - got log in oh baby all right
377:08 - now obviously I don't want to say new
377:10 - I'm going to say code raser okay log in
377:15 - button need to surround this in a
377:26 - link where' my thing
377:29 - go no not
377:32 - homepage app
377:48 - now this needs to change based
377:51 - on if you're signed in or
377:54 - not
378:01 - slash I ordered food by the way guys
378:03 - it's on the way
378:05 - [Music]
378:11 - um I need something that tells me if I'm
378:13 - logged in that'll be token yeah that
378:19 - works
378:21 - none no because token could
378:27 - be okay I actually need to do something
378:29 - here thought process okay so I need to
378:33 - determine if the user's logged in now I
378:37 - could naively just check the token but
378:39 - that's not really going to work because
378:40 - if the token is wrong um then that means
378:43 - the user is not logged in so I need to
378:46 - check if the token is valid by sending
378:48 - an HTTP request so let's do that um
378:55 - okay so Con loged in equals
379:01 - no con log
379:06 - logged in
379:09 - set logged in equals use
379:13 - State false okay and then we're going to
379:19 - say if we're going to fetch say
379:24 - fetch to no that's not how you do it
379:27 - fetch to SL API slash validate
379:32 - token do then
379:35 - do then okay and then we want the
379:40 - options let's
379:42 - go here here here lock
379:46 - in
379:49 - no sign up nope homepage
379:56 - here
380:02 - okay options
380:29 - h
380:35 - then we'll
380:36 - say logged in actually we'll say if
380:40 - logged in
381:18 - no don't need those nice okay uh now we
381:21 - need an end
381:24 - point I guess that would be an off end
381:27 - point yeah would be okay
381:34 - this is pretty easy do this we can
381:37 - literally just do this at
381:40 - o.
381:42 - root
381:45 - validate
381:47 - token SL validate
381:51 - token at what's this damn thing this
381:56 - okay now it just won't even work if uh
381:59 - if you don't send the right
382:01 - token it's good okay and then Define
382:05 - validate undor
382:08 - token
382:10 - okay and
382:12 - then we
382:14 - will
382:19 - return logged
382:21 - in
382:25 - true 200 okay nice um now here views no
382:31 - here get yep get user note wrong page
382:36 - app this is
382:40 - options what are you guys
382:44 - saying psycho light a mystery
382:47 - man no one knows who psychite
382:51 - is I won't expose
382:54 - him make the website dark themed yeah I
382:57 - probably will I can change the styling
382:58 - after I really don't care about the
383:00 - styling if you haveen if you haven't
383:01 - been able to tell we've got five and a
383:03 - half hours left uh you can fetch the
383:05 - user data to check if the token is valid
383:06 - or not you will need that data later
383:08 - anyways that's true that is
383:10 - true but I would like to have a separate
383:13 - endpoint that just doesn't return
383:14 - anything just tells me if I'm logged
383:19 - in well it is very true what he was
383:21 - saying
383:23 - um
383:30 - okay you revealed password on world
383:32 - password day yeah oops okay now let's go
383:37 - to logged in question
383:41 - mark call in
383:45 - this Mark
383:49 - that
383:51 - sign

384:17 - now invariant failed you should not use
384:19 - Link outside a router oh damn
384:22 - it
384:24 - um really what I can't use Link outside
384:27 - a router oh that's

385:10 - nice log out boom let's
385:14 - go sign
385:19 - up guys look how look how amazing this
385:22 - website is have you ever seen anything
385:23 - like
385:24 - this I don't think
385:26 - so this thing doesn't do anything I'm
385:28 - going to have to remove that
385:37 - I keep doing
385:45 - this nice okay
386:09 - okay so that's all working that's that's
386:11 - pretty good I just need to make it so
386:13 - that this link doesn't look so ugly how
386:15 - do you no that's
386:18 - why
386:21 - actually is that going to make a
386:24 - difference looks a little
386:28 - better still kind of bad though and how
386:31 - do you make it so it doesn't I just want
386:33 - it to it I want it to be a button I want
386:35 - it to actually I want to actually see
386:36 - the
386:38 - button maybe I can do it the other way
386:41 - no then it will cut the
386:48 - text let's
386:57 - see let me try this
387:13 - made zero difference
387:20 - okay yeah literally zero difference okay
387:22 - let's go back to the other
387:24 - one all
387:27 - right how do you fast forward a live
387:29 - stream yeah funny one
387:39 - log out button doesn't change if the
387:41 - user logs
387:43 - out this should say log out right now
387:45 - too this is wrong it should say log
387:48 - out
387:54 - um
388:02 - H says long Lo
388:05 - in we are logged
388:08 - in okay let's log
388:24 - off there you go that works what do I
388:28 - refresh
388:32 - H interesting
388:38 - I don't think I need to run this every
388:42 - time I don't think I need to put token
388:44 - in
388:47 - here I think I can do this I think this
388:49 - will fix
388:53 - it
388:56 - unauthorized what
389:08 - oh it's because the state token's
389:09 - different than this
389:11 - token
389:19 - H
389:22 - token this going to get changed
389:56 - okay and then
390:06 - let's try
390:09 - this this is so bad I don't know what I
390:11 - don't know what I'm doing
390:16 - here it's too much thinking okay store
390:19 - token set token start
390:22 - token token then if token does not equal
390:26 - none
390:38 - okay should be
390:41 - fine error
390:44 - occurred what I guess I logged out or
390:56 - something oh

391:16 - working now let me just pray it's not
391:18 - refreshing like a million times I don't
391:20 - think it is okay nice so now we have
391:23 - that let me move this stupid button that
391:26 - doesn't do anything on the toolbar
391:29 - uh icon button I I don't think this does
391:32 - anything
391:36 - delete
391:38 - that there you go yeah good that doesn't
391:41 - yeah it didn't do anything although that

403:17 - the videography for them is like really
403:18 - hard so and YouTube algorithm man I
403:21 - don't know it's just if you do a review
403:23 - for something people are searching for
403:24 - then they'll find it but
403:27 - yeah I it's hard to ask anything else or
403:30 - say anything else about that
403:47 - are you ever going to make anything Mini
403:49 - Max based yes I actually I am planning
403:51 - on making like a chest some something

406:19 - old music is just so much better uh at
406:22 - least in my opinion hey Tim how can I be
406:23 - a good Dev like you any tips always keep
406:26 - learning never assume you know anything
406:28 - everyone you talk to has uh something
406:30 - they can teach you
406:36 - uh what's your words per minute I think
406:38 - with 100% accuracy maybe like 60 or
406:49 - [Music]
406:56 - 70 can you network with HTML I don't
406:58 - know what you mean by that motivation
407:01 - tips uh I would say just set goals like
407:04 - at least for me I kind of have goals
407:06 - that I want to work towards right and
407:08 - everything I do I kind of evaluate
407:10 - against those goals and say is this
407:12 - helping me achieve the goal right and
407:15 - you can come up with your own reasons
407:16 - for if it is or if it isn't helping you
407:17 - achieve it but that's a really good way
407:19 - to determine if you're spending your
407:20 - time wisely is if what you're doing is
407:22 - helping you achieve the things you
407:23 - actually want to achieve right
407:34 - how are you I'm doing good when can you
407:36 - consider yourself a good programmer
407:38 - whenever you want I mean everything's
407:39 - subjective relative um like you could be
407:43 - a good programmer at some things not at
407:45 - other things some people wouldn't even
407:46 - call me a good programmer right so it's
407:48 - completely it's really hard to answer
407:49 - that question I I have no idea
407:53 - [Music]

410:22 - you're really serious about uh growing a
410:24 - YouTube channel literally you got to do
410:26 - kind of what I did it's harder now I'm
410:27 - not going toh say it's easy to do but it
410:30 - was easier when I started doing it like
410:32 - 3 or four years ago ago but I posted a
410:33 - video every day sometimes posting two
410:35 - videos a day for like a year in a row
410:37 - before I even had like 10,000
410:47 - subscribers you can also go look at like
410:49 - more popular YouTubers or YouTubers that
410:51 - are like maybe have like 5K subscribers
410:53 - or 10K subscribers and see like what's
410:55 - doing well for them and then see if you
410:57 - can kind of do your own version of that
410:58 - that's what I do a lot of times
411:06 - the music's Linked In the
411:23 - description watch I'm going to get
411:25 - copyright strike if I get copyright

411:36 - [Music]
411:49 - do a 30 hour live stream yeah maybe one
411:51 - day that would be insane if I did a 30-
411:53 - hour live stream I don't even know what
411:55 - I would do there's no way I could code
411:56 - for 30 hours
411:58 - long how much are you getting working on

412:35 - cheap it's like 12
412:55 - bucks do you need a computer science
412:57 - degree to get a real job absolutely not

418:33 - Pierz
418:42 - defense this is the annoying thing he
418:44 - could be stream sniping
418:45 - me he probably is stream sniping me so I
418:49 - can't really draw like arrows and stuff
418:50 - because the delay is not enough but he
418:53 - already messed up he already
418:54 - blundered unless he's playing some weird
418:57 - Gambit yeah he there's no way he knows
418:58 - what that is
419:06 - oh he's done he's taking way too
419:08 - long uh
419:21 - okay that's true he can see my preo I
419:24 - should be very careful not to preo
419:38 - I've got to play here but uh I think he
419:40 - might see
419:52 - it what do I look like a robot maybe I
419:55 - am who knows it's a f minute game this
419:59 - guy's taking way too long
420:04 - it's not even my move right now what is
420:06 - he G to do

420:35 - fine
420:40 - okay
420:59 - okay I'm going to beat him on time call
421:01 - on it right
421:09 - now this is annoying because I actually
421:11 - want to talk about the game and like
421:12 - what I want to do but I
421:16 - can't interesting

422:28 - kidding I can take that
422:40 - okay what does he have he can go here he
422:43 - can go here he wants to go
422:46 - there because then that's there could
422:49 - push that look like a decent move
422:52 - although that looks better
423:14 - by the way I'm I hope you don't think
423:15 - I'm good at chess because I'm really not
423:16 - that
423:19 - [Music]
423:21 - good man this guy's King is asking to be
423:24 - checked what what is going to happen if
423:25 - I go
423:26 - here oh I could go then I could go there
423:29 - too because you can't block
423:33 - that looks
423:42 - decent could also go for
423:55 - that I think that's a blunder
424:03 - because now I have that defended yeah
424:04 - he's going to
424:06 - lose okay that's fine just take that
424:11 - too okay
424:13 - nice
424:15 - [Music]
424:19 - now coming in for the
424:22 - kill he doesn't have any checks
424:38 - he's going to
424:40 - defend can he even defend if I go here
424:43 - he goes here no I can't do that I go
424:46 - here he goes here I go here no if I go
424:50 - here he can he can't he can take with
424:53 - Queen no can't go Pawn if I go here he
424:57 - can take I can
424:59 - capture
425:00 - um oh this decent move he's
425:03 - [Music]
425:09 - pinned someone said H to D1 yeah I
425:12 - probably should have put the uh sorry
425:14 - the a pawn or the a rook instead of the
425:17 - D
425:22 - Rook he's kind of screwed now he can't
425:24 - really move this yeah see what okay
425:29 - there you go this will work you go there
425:31 - I go
425:42 - there see I even have this Defender too
425:44 - yeah see okay there you
425:46 - go and now he's going to
425:50 - lose GG man good game it's fun I'll play
425:55 - another one at some
425:56 - point I solid okay that's enough chess
426:01 - that fun I can play chess all day man
426:02 - that's why I got to stop if I if I play
426:04 - another one I'm just going to keep
426:05 - playing all right gg gg good game
426:11 - man I didn't realize you were uh I I
426:13 - totally forgot about the difference
426:14 - between Blitz rating and Rapid rating it
426:17 - was a good game though
426:25 - nice all right uh let's keep coding now
426:29 - I'm distracted I'll play uh like if the
426:32 - stream ends or if I take another break
426:34 - I'll play someone else in chess I think
426:35 - a FIV minute game is fine because that's
426:37 - 10 minutes in total uh and I moved
426:39 - pretty fast in that game oh I'll
426:41 - definitely stream rocket League I've
426:42 - been playing rocket League a fair amount
426:43 - I'm not very good at Rocket league but I
426:45 - like it it's a fun game okay we do need
426:48 - to do this I I want to make something
426:50 - more than just like this you know we got
426:52 - to do something so that I can actually
426:53 - have something to show at the end of the
426:55 - stream okay home works log out Works go
426:58 - back to home erer please try signing in
427:01 - okay
427:02 - but then it shows log
427:06 - out but the log out brought me to log in
427:10 - I go to
427:11 - home I think that's cuz it's not
427:14 - refreshing
427:17 - H okay let's
427:26 - see be here
427:32 - if the token doesn't change but the
427:34 - token should change
427:37 - um where's log
427:43 - out okay we going to go to log
427:48 - out this is
427:52 - annoying oh this is what I could do set
427:56 - token and we got to pass it through the
427:58 - props though
428:06 - set it set it to empty okay nice and
428:09 - then go
428:11 - to up
428:14 - S and pass through set
428:20 - token boom see I did okay great oh no
428:23 - that's confirm
428:25 - [Music]
428:29 - email okay
428:41 - should work
428:43 - now see there you go now it works boom
428:47 - got it all
428:51 - right okay now the fun stuff let's make
428:56 - something let's let's go homepage and on
428:59 - the homepage let's show a button that
429:03 - says join race start coding race or
429:07 - something or like we'll do a description
429:09 - of what the app is and then I will
429:13 - um uh what do you call it have some
429:16 - button that says like join race and then
429:17 - it will bring you to a room the room
429:19 - will use sockets
429:21 - um
429:24 - okay all right what do you guys saying
429:26 - here okay not much 373 people still
429:30 - watching very very
429:32 - impressed okay we're going to do some
429:34 - hard coding here for a few minutes um
429:36 - before I just keep testing stuff so
429:39 - let's have a button button will join
429:42 - room yeah let's do that do I have button
429:45 - no I don't have button
429:47 - okay let's import
429:50 - button uh where's where's button button
429:53 - button where would be one be log
430:00 - in
430:06 - button
430:12 - okay actually first before I do that I
430:15 - want to show the user's name and stuff
430:18 - um okay let's just grab this button
430:33 - want to display the user's name on the
430:38 - Navar I can't do that from the homepage
430:40 - though which is where I have the
430:43 - data log in I want to show their wpm and
430:47 - everything
430:51 - um okay let's go to app
430:56 - yes I guess theoretically this could get
430:59 - the user's data which someone else was
431:01 - saying rather than going logged in just
431:03 - get the user data and if that works that
431:06 - works okay excuse me uh so if they're
431:09 - logged
431:11 - in yeah that would make sense to do
431:13 - wouldn't
431:15 - it well we can do both we can check if
431:18 - their token is valid and then we can
431:19 - call it's kind of redundant but it's
431:21 - fine we're going to do that we're going
431:22 - to
431:24 - say con
431:27 - get user data because then we can pass
431:30 - that through to the
431:32 - homepage okay yeah that works
431:40 - um okay let's just stop and think for a
431:42 - second so I want the user's data I want
431:44 - to displayed on the nav bar the only way
431:46 - to display on nav bar the way I've done
431:48 - this so far is to display it um here
431:52 - through app
431:55 - however however if I'm getting it from
431:58 - the homepage then I can't display it
431:59 - here unless I use a call back I don't
432:01 - want to use a call back so I should get
432:03 - the data here and pass it to the
432:06 - homepage yeah and then the homepage can
432:09 - display it if it hasn't and that way I
432:11 - don't have to store it in the state of
432:13 - the homepage I would uh simply store it
432:15 - in the props that would be better so
432:18 - let's change
432:24 - that and then there and then here I
432:27 - don't have to do all this crap I can do
432:29 - it in the other one and then I can just
432:30 - check
432:31 - if they um have a username or email and
432:35 - I can show the error if they don't that
432:38 - makes sense okay so let's do that let's
432:41 - take
432:43 - this and then let's just check simply
432:45 - here if props do username does not equal
432:52 - equal or does equal equal
432:55 - empty and props actually it would be
432:57 - undefined I guess if I didn't pass it
432:58 - right or no it just yeah empty string
433:00 - okay
433:01 - and then props do email equals equals
433:05 - empty and we're going to
433:07 - say set
433:10 - air please log in to view this
433:18 - page okay
433:20 - nice uh okay solid then go back to
433:27 - app token window look storage okay get
433:34 - I don't want to show this
433:47 - though there set
433:50 - error actually don't care to show the
433:53 - err oh no I should show the
433:57 - a okay that's fine and then we'll go
434:05 - here we'll
434:10 - say get user
434:12 - data
434:19 - okay what's the
434:22 - problem oh that's what it
434:24 - is
434:28 - compiling set emails not defined oh I
434:30 - forgot the to put the state here
434:33 - um okay
435:07 - alss say con sh I don't need ID that's
435:14 - fine email
435:17 - username

435:25 - H token okay this is where it's getting
435:28 - tough here um hm
435:36 - let's
435:37 - see problem is I know I'm going to need
435:39 - the ID of the user actually let me check

435:47 - token I think I can let me go to
435:52 - fuse yeah current user oh easy okay yeah

452:18 - e value inspect
452:30 - just zero I guess it doesn't tell me
452:32 - what I clicked e. Target maybe let's see
452:34 - if that gives me
452:41 - anything it does okay I
452:46 - want I need a value for them so I know
452:49 - which one is clicked
452:54 - um ah I can do this
453:01 - click uh
453:06 - with
453:09 - say
453:11 - profile ah this this is perfect this is
453:13 - the end point to go to
453:24 - great and then here make
453:28 - this end point do I have history no I
453:32 - don't have
453:38 - history is history and
453:46 - then boom okay now we need to just
453:48 - import
453:50 - history that's from react
453:55 - Dom okay
454:00 - got
454:00 - it
454:03 - sweet use
454:05 - history should be defined save
454:12 - Fresh canot re property push him on to
454:16 - find straight to push end point that
454:18 - should work
454:20 - [Music]
454:36 - H what am I doing
454:40 - wrong history use history
454:59 - close
455:01 - that
455:08 - okay don't know why that's not working
455:13 - use history should
455:20 - work oh is it because it's in the no
455:24 - that's that shouldn't be the problem
455:34 - how is history undefined I don't
455:36 - understand why that's
455:52 - undefined like what this should work I'm
455:55 - so confused this works in all the other
455:58 - ones why can I not use it in this
456:00 - function H history is
456:03 - undefined why don't I just do
456:07 - this no way it's going to be undefined
456:11 - now react component names must start
456:14 - with an uppercase
456:20 - letter damn it so I can't do
456:25 - that why why don't you work can I repr
456:30 - property push of
456:34 - undefined I don't think endpoint has a
456:37 - problem with it
456:40 - shouldn't just this is confusing though
456:42 - cuz that works in other places like if I
456:45 - go log
456:46 - at boom cons history equals use history
456:49 - just
456:51 - works then I push it right there the
456:54 - same
456:55 - thing um
457:06 - what if we do
457:21 - this it's not the Endo this problem guys
457:24 - it's that history is undefined but I
457:26 - don't know why history is undefined cuz
457:27 - I've defined it
457:38 - right like what shouldn't be
457:51 - undefined see it's saying history's
457:53 - undefined but I don't know why let's
457:55 - look it up
458:05 - H oh I think I know
458:09 - why that's
458:12 - why it's because I initialized this
458:16 - before I initialize the first render for
458:19 - the uh the router um so I have to say
458:21 - let history
458:24 - equal
458:26 - null and then oh will this even let me
458:28 - do this though let's see here
458:30 - here history equals uh use
458:35 - history that should work I can't use it
458:48 - there can I okay how do I just like
458:50 - redirect then or something um without
458:53 - history h i could just make it so when
458:56 - you press those buttons you yeah why
458:58 - don't we just
459:00 - cuz I guess I can do this and then I can
459:02 - also redirect them okay let's just do
459:09 - this like we can do multiple things we
459:12 - can do
459:20 - this
459:26 - okay redirect
459:37 - react think I can
459:45 - just unclick run the function you can
459:48 - render a redirect component does that do
459:50 - it let's
459:57 - see what do you guys
460:05 - saying react
460:14 - router I can return a
460:27 - redirect he straight up push yes or
460:30 - that's what I'm trying to do it's not
460:45 - working CU I don't have access to
460:50 - history
460:56 - H I could do window.location
460:59 - but that's not
461:02 - good yeah I could I can use windows.
461:05 - replace but I don't want to do that
461:06 - because then it's not going to um pass
461:09 - fill the props so let's just
461:14 - do that's like a yeah that's a sketchy
461:17 - way to do it so I'm going to
461:18 - do I'm just going to do a link inside of
461:22 - here hoping it doesn't mess my styling
461:24 - up
461:32 - and then we can remove this that we
461:34 - don't need
461:40 - [Music]
461:44 - to okay link
462:14 - okay oh what the heck
462:17 - okay
462:21 - my count
462:23 - to count what's wrong here what am I
462:27 - what have I done wrong
462:30 - why is this not
462:33 - working oh it's
462:40 - F to log out
462:45 - and L
462:47 - out okay I hate how these
462:51 - look um but for now they're fine we we
462:55 - can fix styling after okay so now this
462:57 - should work if I go here press log in
462:59 - out yeah it does work if I go oh and
463:01 - then I yeah and then I'm not logged in
463:03 - so I can't press that awesome okay great
463:05 - okay let's let's do the code racing
463:06 - thing now uh so Tim 5
463:10 - at mailinator.com
463:12 - 123 log in nice okay I don't want to log
463:17 - out when I press join erase we're going
463:19 - to have to use sockets so now time to
463:20 - learn flask
463:22 - sockets flask
463:27 - sockets okay into flash socket
463:30 - documentation I actually think this is
463:31 - pretty easy to use I remember this being
463:33 - pretty easy to
463:37 - use oh oops it already had it for me pip
463:40 - install floss
463:45 - socket let's go to requirements
464:00 - okay now we have to initialize
464:10 - sockets I run it in
464:21 - socod
464:24 - Oh okay that's fine
465:03 - okay let's just try
465:10 - this what
465:24 - oh sweet got it okay um
465:31 - so why did it recreate the database I
465:34 - don't think I deleted the database
465:36 - anyways that's fine for now okay so now
465:39 - this is how I connect to the socket in
465:42 - JavaScript socket. emit my event I am
465:45 - connected okay let's make a new
465:51 - component main UI new file going to be
465:57 - racer. Js
465:59 - we'll say racing room or we'll say room
466:02 - room. JS yeah that's good uh room rename
466:14 - JS now the fun begins yes guys I'm tired
466:17 - it's been almost eight hours as soon as
466:19 - we hit 7.m so 10 minutes going to be
466:21 - eight hours we have four hours left but
466:23 - we got to keep going there's no stopping
466:26 - uh let's go
466:31 - want
466:34 - this we don't need like a lot of
466:38 - this okay don't need
466:42 - that don't need
466:46 - that don't need
466:49 - that it's probably just faster to type
466:51 - this out now I'm thinking about it but
466:53 - that's
466:54 - fine okay good uh we're going to call
466:59 - this
467:01 - room say this is
467:04 - room okay div we do want the room code
467:09 - we're going to say cons room code is
467:11 - equal to
467:13 - props
467:15 - match. prams do room code okay it's
467:20 - going to be
467:22 - props let's go to
467:27 - app let's now make another
467:32 - route okay exact this is going to be
467:38 - room colon room code uh we don't need a
467:43 - set
467:45 - token no we
467:47 - don't and this will be a
467:50 - room like
467:52 - that okay we're going to say from
468:00 - Port room
468:03 - from slash main
468:06 - UI slash
468:09 - room do
468:11 - slash okay room export default
468:15 - room show the room
468:18 - code
468:21 - okay room. JS oh it needs to be in
468:24 - capitals okay
468:30 - compiling
468:32 - nice let's go to slash room slash
468:37 - test nice shows me the room code test
468:40 - one two 3 test one two3 sweet okay so
468:45 - now that's how we can join a room now
468:48 - what we want to do is when you press
468:49 - that button it will uh put you into a
468:52 - room so here we go look at this
469:10 - the application must serve a page to the
469:12 - client that loads the socket.io library
469:14 - and establish
469:15 - connection okay let's take this put this
469:19 - in our
469:22 - index uh script should go at the bottom
469:27 - I think
469:30 - okay it's fine and then
469:34 - whoa so that looks like it's
469:49 - working let's go into our room let's
469:53 - go use effect
470:06 - go
470:12 - IO how the heck is it going to get
470:16 - IO I can Define use effect
470:23 - first IO not defined um
470:30 - how do how am I going to do that uh use
470:33 - sockets
470:35 - react
470:39 - okay can I just do
470:53 - this it has a it has a socket thing
471:04 - no that's
471:10 - different
471:13 - no iio Doon how do I get
471:22 - IO socket.io client nice okay thank you
471:27 - uh Muhammad let let's go
471:30 - new CD
471:59 - I already have a socket see thing I want
472:01 - to connect to a
472:08 - socket create a file socket.
472:16 - JS okay let's try this
472:36 - oh call this new file or new
472:40 - folder
472:51 - context man people just drive their cars
472:54 - so loud okay uh use socket contacts and
472:57 - provide value
473:00 - can I so I have to wrap everything in
473:02 - this
473:05 - okay
473:11 - JS oh someone
473:16 - subscribed what why is it showing me
473:18 - that oh no it's going to spam one sec
473:21 - let me fix
473:25 - this done okay I think I think that
473:29 - fixed it progress we're get we're
473:31 - getting there I'm working on sockets
473:32 - right now once I have the sockets
473:34 - working then we just have to Define kind
473:35 - of the protocol and then um we will see
473:39 - we'll be able to actually like render a
473:42 - block of code and then have uh the live
473:45 - progress back and forth it'll be cool
473:46 - we're actually getting we're made we
473:48 - made really good progress we have four
473:49 - hours left and I had probably about an
473:51 - hour during the stream of just dead time
473:53 - cuz like breakes plus um crashed cuz cuz
473:57 - I had my power go out plus the beginning
473:59 - was just really hectic okay I need to
474:01 - wrap all this though in this and then I
474:05 - need to end socket
474:13 - provider need to import
474:17 - this import child why do I wait what is
474:21 - that just like
474:22 - a oh okay that was just that's just like
474:25 - boiler plate I don't need that
474:29 - see if this
474:33 - works be impressed if this
474:41 - works should probably be do SL
474:48 - context
474:49 - error resource
474:52 - busy fail to compile can't resolve
475:00 - oh it's cuz I'm in app right
475:01 - [Music]
475:06 - now app is in components
475:11 - oh I didn't realize I put app in
475:20 - components be dot dot slash there you go
475:23 - should work
475:30 - you look like you're dead inside
475:32 - yeah that's funny can't resolve config
475:38 - what what did I do
475:42 - here oh it's cuz I don't have one of
475:46 - those socket URL um this was
475:54 - saying
475:56 - what okay I did this before I'm just
475:58 - going to look at my chat web app oh why
476:00 - didn't I do this it's in here totally
476:02 - forgot that I had this this working in
476:04 - here uh
476:06 - application you up
476:12 - high I have some socket thing oh I
476:15 - didn't do it here I did it
476:18 - in here that's where I did it
476:22 - um okay socket.io socket.io Doon okay
476:29 - and then for the
476:33 - JavaScript being
476:49 - static here you go
476:55 - [Music]
476:59 - plus
477:05 - 5,000
477:07 - nice all right let's try
477:15 - this io's not fine react's not
477:22 - fine from react okay and
477:28 - a where did I put that
477:31 - room yeah I don't need
477:35 - this okay
477:38 - nice
477:40 - nice okay looks like that's working but
477:42 - the question is is it actually going to
477:44 - work okay so now now you can use socket
477:48 - and any child
477:51 - component okay
478:00 - this looks like a really good good
478:02 - template I'm just going to steal
478:08 - this okay yeah we can override this
478:16 - [Music]
478:32 - why do I room code twice not what I
478:34 - wanted oh I deleted this socket thing
478:36 - damn it it's not what I wanted to
478:39 - do there you
478:41 - go that's what I wanted to
478:45 - do okay
478:54 - [Music]
479:11 - okay where's user
479:15 - ID um I don't need
479:20 - [Music]
479:23 - that this will be token
479:26 - [Music]
479:29 - um room
479:32 - code well let's think about
479:37 - thiso this is tough
479:45 - [Music]
479:47 - okay room
479:51 - URL out them in the room should be
479:54 - connected
480:02 - okay I'm kind of doing this a bit
480:05 - backwards
480:08 - um yeah four more hours left guys going
480:12 - to have another caffeine dose
480:14 - soon
480:17 - [Music]
480:19 - okay boom okay it's saying use W there
480:22 - okay great that's great or cookie if
480:25 - token
480:30 - oh
480:33 - perfect okay guys I'm going to take a
480:34 - quick break just going to go wash him
480:36 - I'll be right back
481:20 - [Music]
483:14 - [Music]
484:40 - all right we
484:45 - back
484:51 - okay I'm working on sockets yeah sockets
484:53 - are
484:54 - um not particularly easy easy here I'm
484:58 - going to go back to what I had
485:00 - before this is fine what I'm going to do
485:03 - is join the socket from the
485:08 - uh room
485:11 - page where are you joining the
485:15 - socket when you go to the room you
485:18 - should already
485:18 - [Music]
485:26 - be okay this is going to be tough what
485:29 - I'm trying to figure out
485:31 - is how do I connect users in some type
485:36 - of room I need users to kind of get
485:39 - filtered to some room that has some ID
485:41 - they need to be then redirected to that
485:44 - room and they need to join the socket so
485:47 - the thing is do I connect them to the
485:49 - socket once they join the room or do
485:52 - I connect them to the socket then have
485:55 - them join the
485:56 - room
485:58 - H
486:00 - so let's think here rooms user join they
486:04 - get assigned to a
486:06 - room then they should get redirected to
486:08 - that
486:14 - room connect them to the socket return
486:17 - the room send the room I don't know
486:28 - okay let's just see if we can connect
486:29 - them to the socket first of
486:38 - all we're going to go to
486:42 - homepage we're going to set up something
486:44 - here
486:59 - okay here we'll connect to the
487:05 - socket saying this is as easy as it is
487:13 - okay context
487:35 - okay okay we'll do that and
487:49 - then okay
487:56 - [Music]
488:01 - do
488:04 - this so on join room is when I want to
488:08 - do this actually
488:14 - oops want to admit user online want to
488:18 - then on join request accepted handle
488:21 - invite accepted set join true and then
488:25 - here let's just pop something up that
488:27 - says if we're joined or not go rather
488:31 - than this we'll
488:32 - say oh the way we can know is if we're
488:39 - joined then we can go to a
488:42 - room yo Nick white what's up welcome to
488:45 - the
488:47 - stream yes sir Saka J I have no idea how
488:50 - to uh to do this but we're we're
488:52 - figuring out as we go here verified
488:54 - person yeah wow big deal first one of
488:56 - the Stream
489:01 - okay so once oh I need to use call back
489:08 - hook
489:11 - okay
489:15 - um we'll just do something that says if
489:17 - they're joined or not we won't worry
489:18 - about redirecting right now I'll just
489:21 - say joined is that my State's called
489:24 - yeah it is okay so to AIT
489:27 - handle join chat send join
489:32 - request handle invite
489:36 - accepted
489:42 - M handle invite accepted handle invite
489:45 - accepted join

490:24 - summer thank you very much Nick white
490:26 - for the $5 Super Chat appreciate that
490:28 - with the helpful uh coding here sock. on
490:30 - key press broadcast opponent key press
490:32 - very nice very
490:36 - nice that's funny okay let's
490:42 - continue There You Go look I even have
490:44 - the fancy animation showing up
490:48 - okay yeah if you can't tell eight hours
490:50 - it's it's taking the toll now okay let's
490:53 - just say joined question mark colon
490:58 - and let's see if anything actually
490:59 - happens failed to compile can't resolve
491:01 - contact
491:04 - socket in main
491:09 - UI oh that's why because I'm in main UI
491:12 - dot dot slash that should work
491:15 - now can't
491:17 - resolve so main UI context is
491:21 - back One Directory level two three
491:23 - that's fine let's try
491:28 - fingers
491:35 - crossed H socket
491:39 - context so I'm in components manui I
491:43 - need to import this socket. JS although
491:48 - can I use it through the props or
491:50 - something
492:03 - use
492:11 - context
492:14 - okay socket context if I go to context
492:19 - socket you know what would make
492:20 - everything a lot easier if I just just
492:22 - put it in components let's just do that
492:25 - okay delete
492:29 - and now let's go and fix all our uh all
492:32 - our Imports here docket that should work
492:36 - from app yeah that would
492:38 - work but from
492:42 - homepage should
492:44 - be dot dot slash no am I doing the
492:48 - pathing wrong it's very possible I'm
492:49 - writing the path here wrong can I
492:52 - resolve dot dot
492:53 - socket context
492:58 - oh it's cuz yeah that's
493:01 - why user ID is not defined boom that's
493:04 - working now where do I have user
493:07 - ID we're just going to send the token
493:09 - here
493:12 - um okay let's get the token say cons
493:15 - token
493:17 - equals where's do my starring the token
493:21 - window. local storage
493:29 - okay and then we'll pass the token
493:33 - here nice okay that looks like that's
493:37 - working now when I press the button I'm
493:39 - expecting it to
493:44 - crash is anything
493:46 - happening access has been blocked by
493:49 - course policy no control access origin
493:51 - headers present on the requested
493:55 - resources okay
494:05 - whoa what the
494:20 - heck the problem is that for some reason
494:23 - I can't access I don't even know what
494:25 - this means
494:29 - it's been blocked by course policy let's
494:32 - just look this up
495:08 - okay
495:28 - ah damn it okay this is annoying um I
495:31 - did get flas cores what's actually
495:33 - happening is it's saying that I can't
495:35 - send I can't connect to a socket that's
495:37 - not the same origin because I have a
495:40 - different front end different back end
495:41 - and I want to connect to a back end
495:42 - socket not front socket
495:48 - um can I just
495:51 - Define let's see someone sent me a
495:55 - link site
496:07 - let's try
496:13 - that socket.
496:19 - server oh I probably did
496:23 - that in Python
496:30 - that would be
496:36 - here Su at
496:42 - server this is different than what I
496:44 - have though I think maybe this is
496:48 - passible
496:57 - let's
496:59 - see restarting that looks like that
497:02 - worked can refresh
497:07 - this no way okay that actually did fix
497:10 - the problem thank you very much Muhammad
497:12 - you are you're being a big help today
497:14 - really appreciate it okay um so that did
497:18 - work now obviously nothing's happening
497:20 - but join should I should be getting

497:55 - way in here
498:02 - do
498:10 - this okay um now going to set up the
498:15 - emit
498:17 - event should not have closed that code

502:19 - port 5000 yeah it is
502:23 - right
502:25 - H how do do I just connect to
502:29 - [Music]
502:31 - this I don't really have any idea what's
502:34 - going on this is uh the emit is not
502:42 - working
502:44 - Sako
502:50 - polling join a
502:53 - racee um okay run API
503:00 - let's maybe this isn't
503:02 - saved that's
503:07 - [Music]
503:12 - possible it's not
503:17 - [Music]
503:20 - working I have an idea let me go here
503:28 - I don't think I need
503:46 - [Music]
503:53 - that h
503:59 - maybe I need to like
504:01 - connect did I do this value equals
504:03 - socket I think so
504:10 - [Music]
504:22 - [Music]
504:33 - [Music]
504:40 - H this is so annoying the damn socket I
504:43 - don't know why it's not
504:46 - connecting socket.
504:49 - emit
504:50 - um okay let me just see if I can do it
504:53 - in the more vanilla way first
504:56 - going to do in vanilla Jaz and see if I
504:58 - can get it to
505:01 - [Music]
505:08 - [Music]
505:23 - work let me look at something here
505:27 - you guys can't even see what I'm looking
505:28 - at let's go here
505:31 - website
505:41 - response I know but I just want to see
505:43 - if I can get it to work
505:45 - [Music]
505:47 - um oops okay um
505:57 - where is
505:59 - [Music]
506:04 - this
506:07 - okay because I could write this in here
506:19 - [Music]
506:30 - [Music]
506:39 - like IO how the heck do I get
506:42 - [Music]
506:47 - IO how to get access to IO that's the
506:50 - question
506:57 - [Music]
507:03 - um to
507:13 - iio I can do this right
507:29 - can't
507:34 - resolve oh maybe this is what I need to
507:37 - install maybe it's just
507:44 - socod uh no let's
507:49 - see once I get sockets working then
507:53 - we're
507:55 - rolling
507:58 - hopefully the actual like typing racer
508:00 - part shouldn't be that hard it's just uh
508:02 - trying to get these damn sockets to
508:05 - work come on work
508:12 - work
508:24 - maybe I know I should only connect to it
508:26 - one time but I uh I don't want to
508:28 - connect until they log
508:30 - in and I just want to see if unexpected
508:35 - use of location damn 8 hours in already
508:37 - Elsa just realized it's past midnight
508:39 - for me I'm a dip good luck with the
508:40 - project Take Care thank you Steven
508:42 - appreciate
508:43 - that um
508:46 - homepage
508:49 - 25 yeah okay that would be why
509:04 - where's where is
509:05 - location oh that's
509:17 - why io. connect is not function
509:41 - I will use the uh the real thing I just
509:44 - want to see if I can get this to
509:52 - work wait IO
509:57 - why can't I even Define the the port to
510:00 - connect to io. listm Port once you've
510:03 - done that you also need to tell s start
510:06 - listening for
510:08 - clients oh that's defining the
510:13 - server how do I
510:17 - connect on the client this is what I
510:19 - want
510:28 - looks like I can do this let's get rid
510:30 - of all
510:36 - this okay let's go socket
510:41 - [Music]
510:53 - [Music]
511:00 - H
511:08 - okay man this
511:13 - [Music]
511:19 - depressing don't need that
511:32 - I just want to connect to the damn
511:34 - socket it shouldn't be this
511:38 - [Music]
511:41 - hard socket like the socket's not doing
511:44 - anything is the problem um if I go here
511:47 - Local Host 5,000 okay great I back
511:50 - exported it
511:54 - [Music]
511:56 - it's saying this is all you got to
512:04 - do okay flask
512:08 - socket server with react client
512:34 - try uninstall socket IO client and
512:37 - reinstall no way if that works I'm be so
512:44 - upset is this what it was no it was the
512:47 - other way around right so
512:52 - client socket.io
512:54 - [Music]
513:00 - it's not it's Local Host
513:02 - 5,000 yeah I'm definitely tired
513:15 - [Music]
513:22 - guys let's see if this one works
513:32 - like when it connects to the socket I
513:34 - should get something no something should
513:44 - [Music]
513:52 - happen why don't you use WSL uh I mean
513:56 - that doesn't really matter right
513:58 - now yeah my Tic Tac to toad tutorial
514:01 - used uh sockets and it
514:09 - worked no
514:12 - way guys it was really the version of
514:15 - socket iio look it actually just worked
514:17 - it just connected and I got the run here
514:19 - in the server oh my God these are the
514:21 - kind of problems in programming where
514:23 - you just want to shoot yourself after
514:25 - it's like really like you did everything
514:26 - you could and it turns out it's the
514:28 - version of the thing that you installed
514:30 - that just doesn't
514:31 - work oh my God
514:34 - man okay well it's working now so I'm
514:37 - not as crazy as I thought I
514:39 - was cuz now it's working
514:42 - [Music]
514:45 - yay damn damn it
514:50 - man freaking stack Overflow that had two
514:53 - likes I got to give I got to donate to
514:55 - that guy whoever whoever helped me do
514:56 - that oh my God standard programming
515:00 - problems okay let's take a quick
515:02 - breather here and just uh appreciate
515:03 - that yeah that was T tag party yeah
515:07 - claps in the chat claps in the chat
515:08 - please 320 people left yeah I want to
515:11 - show you guys the damn graph of people
515:13 - watching this makes sense it's about my
515:15 - uh mental health State too kind of
515:18 - follows it
515:26 - this is why you write your own sockets
515:27 - nah no no no no no no it's just that's
515:30 - yeah I don't want to do that
515:35 - um
515:40 - okay all right so at least the
515:43 - communication is now
515:45 - working which is very very
515:49 - good
515:52 - so uh development server is disconnected
515:58 - boom connects okay so once we connect
516:02 - that's very good so I want to connect
516:04 - when you press that button and then I
516:05 - want to
516:07 - redirect uh so once I'm connected I have
516:09 - that context so I can just use it
516:11 - somewhere else which is great um let's
516:13 - redirect though let's go I need
516:18 - history history.
516:21 - push and then I want to push to the room
516:25 - which is going to be returned from this
516:28 - socket here uh it's going to say join
516:30 - room or something that's okay great
516:31 - we've got progress now um so what I want
516:35 - to do
516:37 - is use history
516:41 - okay
516:46 - import use history from
516:51 - react router
516:53 - Dom say
516:59 - cons history
517:01 - equals use history that's good okay and
517:06 - then we're going to go to slash room
517:08 - slash Plus
517:11 - Code cons
517:13 - code equals that for now
517:23 - [Music]
517:26 - okay
517:28 - um yeah then we'll redirect to room okay
517:31 - so push that button it's going to say
517:34 - soccer.on handle
517:36 - invite need go and handle
517:38 - invite okay join
517:41 - true cons code history. push room code
517:45 - and then we need to get the
517:48 - code so this a used call back but they
517:50 - should get some stuff
517:57 - I know super descriptive should get some
517:59 - stuff it's not what I want I want to
518:04 - that's dangerous game opening up history
518:06 - I'm going to do it over here okay
518:08 - history although to be fair everything
518:09 - I've been looking up is just code but
518:11 - let's see here course
518:14 - errors recently
518:18 - closed where's this guy's article that
518:20 - that was really good I need to find it
518:23 - history
518:37 - is this it yeah boom I think this is
518:44 - it nope not
518:47 - it
518:49 - okay um
518:59 - this is it found
519:05 - it Tim can we get a data science or
519:07 - machine learning without a college
519:09 - degree um yes I think
519:14 - so okay
519:30 - good idea to do
519:35 - [Music]
519:38 - that he's doing that use
519:41 - effect he's doing the use effect
519:51 - [Music]
519:58 - how do I receive data here though I'm
520:00 - going to imagine it's in the prams use
520:03 - call back
520:06 - Json console.log
520:10 - Json okay because right now I'm just
520:12 - sending
520:13 - messages I want to go
520:17 - to
520:20 - this
520:22 - this socket. admit
520:28 - go
520:29 - data test okay let's go here tell me I
520:35 - have this open two
520:36 - times the thing I was looking for I
520:38 - literally have open
520:42 - okay oh man okay um let's see if that
520:49 - [Music]
520:54 - works boom got it sweet oh yeah re
520:58 - redirected room I didn't want to do that
521:00 - so I need okay I needed to give me a
521:01 - room now um I guess I can thr the rooms
521:05 - in memory because if the server crashes
521:06 - then it's fine you can just the the
521:08 - rooms can crash oh man this thing is
521:10 - going to break so easily I am not going
521:12 - to be able to host this probably it's
521:13 - just going to be too insecure um okay I
521:17 - want to St in session
521:20 - so okay so here's the problem guys let's
521:23 - create rooms with two people people
521:26 - actually there's something in socer to
521:27 - make rooms we're going to look at that
521:28 - first
521:42 - [Music]
521:58 - [Music]
522:00 - let's just go to flly
522:03 - socker almost at 9 hours in
522:23 - guys GM got
522:30 - it okay as Anno as bad as it is I'm
522:33 - going to do all the socket stuff in here
522:35 - we can refactor later but I want to get
522:36 - something
522:40 - working this is such a mess I'm going to
522:42 - look at this tomorrow and it's just
522:43 - going to be crazy my cat's here fra
522:45 - what's
522:49 - up you going to come on the desk
522:57 - unfortunately I can't show her to you
522:58 - guys on the
523:06 - ground Tim did you have dinner yes I did
523:08 - eat I didn't eat that much but I I ate
523:10 - enough I I find when I'm on like a ton
523:13 - of caffeine which I am right now uh it's
523:15 - hard to
523:21 - eat but these are these are uh you know
523:23 - once in a while I don't do these very of
523:25 - often so I appreciate the concern guys
523:26 - but I'll be all right fine un I'm going
523:29 - to have a nice sleep
523:44 - tonight okay
524:08 - no the cat's gone she left me okay join
524:12 - room room
524:17 - send
524:20 - um join
524:32 - room
524:53 - okay okay data room leave room send room
524:57 - send username has left room okay so now
525:00 - I need a way to send what room that they
525:02 - should join
525:12 - um oh Sak D joins nice catch there thank
525:15 - you
525:17 - chat
525:20 - um okay so I need a way to determine
525:24 - what room user to joinan do it in
525:26 - session no I can't do it in session
525:31 - um to create a
525:34 - room and
525:36 - then allow someone to join it I think
525:41 - that I can do it in
525:44 - memory it's probably really bad to do it
525:46 - in memory but I'm going to do it in
525:47 - memory set rooms equals this oh actually
525:52 - say next
525:55 - underscore room equals
525:57 - one okay now when you
526:00 - join next room inore roomal
526:05 - zero is this going to work no way this
526:08 - is going to
526:16 - work could store it in the
526:21 - database rooms find a room that only is
526:24 - one person
526:32 - H do you ever have coffee yeah I have
526:35 - coffee sometimes but it's kind of like I
526:36 - don't know right now it just feels late
526:37 - for
526:53 - coffee okay I actually need to put
526:56 - these somewhere else now that I'm
526:58 - thinking about
526:59 - it I'm going to do a bit of refactoring
527:02 - here no I'm not I'm not uh I'm not
527:05 - almost
527:12 - done okay I want to set up all the
527:15 - socket iio
527:17 - stuff in
527:19 - a I think I can run
527:23 - API cuz I need access to the database
527:25 - and a bunch of other stuff
527:27 - too create
527:45 - app okay you know what because this
527:48 - is going to be hard to do right now I'm
527:53 - just going to say room
527:55 - code equals one and we're just gonna
527:59 - have everyone join room one for right
528:00 - now
528:03 - um
528:05 - okay yeah and I don't really care what
528:07 - they send me here oh they're sending me
528:09 - a token I have to validate their token
528:11 - actually um to make sure that's right
528:14 - because if they send me an invalid token
528:15 - I can't let them join
528:37 - so I need
528:42 - this just going to go in run
528:50 - API can I do this is this going to work
528:55 - no it's
528:58 - not
529:05 - H validate
529:09 - token
529:12 - token um confirm token
529:32 - okay think I can do
529:38 - this okay let's just let's close
529:41 - everything let's start from the
529:43 - beginning for a
529:45 - second so that I can focus on what I
529:47 - need to focus on okay let's go here
529:50 - let's
529:51 - say from API import app okay from
529:57 - api. token import
530:00 - confirm
530:04 - token okay now
530:06 - let's take the token and make sure
530:09 - that's confirmed before we emit anything
530:11 - back so we actually don't let them join
530:14 - unless the token is
530:17 - confirmed okay so I'm going to say if
530:26 - actually we'll say
530:28 - if
530:32 - token is in
530:36 - Json man I'm typing in JavaScript now oh
530:40 - my God uh then we'll say
530:44 - token is equal to
530:49 - json. get token none uh actually no we
530:53 - just do this
530:55 - Jon
530:58 - token
531:00 - else socket.
531:06 - emit no
531:10 - token
531:11 - received
531:19 - okay and return
531:25 - say if
531:38 - token else socket.
531:44 - emit token
531:46 - invalid and there you go okay let's see
531:50 - if this works we'll do the same thing
531:53 - here so this this could be a
531:58 - decorator no I don't think
532:04 - so actually I can just do this can I
532:07 - let's
532:12 - see
532:14 - token can I apply decorator
532:19 - to see
532:35 - and then here
532:58 - if
533:19 - not okay oh my God I'm get so many
533:22 - messages
533:36 - [Music]
533:39 - okay join same thing here okay
533:54 - okay so
533:58 - then the room do we need username yeah
534:00 - we'll pass username and room okay let's
534:04 - go
534:05 - to
534:11 - homepage handle invite accepted okay
534:15 - then we're going to
534:16 - say the same thing here socket.
534:21 - ammit join
534:24 - pass the
534:27 - token joinan request
534:32 - accepted what are we going to emit
534:36 - here I guess we're just waiting for
534:40 - something um
535:01 - send it's going to send this to what's
535:05 - connected how do I make
535:12 - it oh that joins the user in the room
535:14 - and then he will accept
535:16 - anything okay
535:28 - I should have done the sockets
535:30 - first how do I listen for like an event
535:34 - how do I listen for anything so I'm
535:36 - joined the room and then I want to just
535:39 - accept anything okay let's
535:49 - see so once I'm connected to the socket
535:52 - how do I like accept anything thing
535:54 - that's the question
536:03 - um socket. on but I'm not waiting for
536:06 - like a specific event I'm waiting for
536:13 - anything you know what I mean I've been
536:16 - going for nine hours by the way um
536:30 - so I've join the
536:31 - room that's
536:34 - good and then it's going to send
536:37 - something so code is not defined where
536:39 - is
536:43 - that homepage.
536:51 - JS handle invite accepted
536:54 - let's see here join request accepted
536:58 - okay and
537:00 - then say we could I I can just do it a
537:04 - different way I'm going to
537:05 - send see because this is it's sending to
537:08 - anyone in the room but I don't know how
537:10 - to just accept
537:12 - anything this is the problem here I know
537:15 - how to listen for an event but I don't
537:17 - know how to listen for just anything
537:20 - right and it's not
537:22 - admitting it's admitting just a
537:26 - message cuz this isn't show really
537:28 - return okay that's
537:30 - fine could I say socket. listen or
537:33 - something let's
537:35 - see socket iio client
537:38 - react listen to all
537:52 - events on any
538:03 - okay let's try that
538:05 - [Music]
538:06 - um reest handle handle invite
538:14 - [Music]
538:22 - accepted on and need
538:28 - join this needs to give me room I'm
538:30 - going to join with the token okay this
538:33 - going to say token colon
538:36 - token room colon
538:41 - room room colon
538:44 - Json
538:46 - room okay event name
538:56 - where do I have
539:07 - code see what are you guys saying yeah
539:09 - that might work okay log
539:12 - in oh this isn't running
539:26 - shouldn't
539:35 - this
539:44 - melor no it's not
539:48 - working
539:52 - what come on work was working
539:59 - before maybe it's cuz this is running
540:09 - no maybe it's cuz the token's not
540:12 - valid that's probably
540:15 - [Music]
540:20 - why let's try that
540:24 - I bet that's the
540:27 - [Music]
540:30 - case name oh like what am I doing guys
540:33 - oh my God wrong language yeah I'm a
540:36 - little bit stuck right
540:42 - now not valid Ah that's the case it tell
540:44 - me my token's not valid why is my token
540:46 - not valid my token should be
540:50 - valid how do I check if the damn token
540:52 - is valid
540:57 - gave me something in
541:04 - here okay let me go to confirm token
541:30 - [Music]
541:31 - me see what this is equal
541:36 - [Music]
541:41 - to maybe it's not even making that
541:44 - far maybe it's cuz I'm not sending the
541:46 - token oh that's probably why yeah I know
541:50 - why uh CU I'm just sending it like that
541:52 - I'm not sending it like this
541:59 - that's probably
542:00 - why okay let's try
542:03 - now socket is not
542:10 - find
542:19 - socod false not valid
542:42 - H okay we're getting we're getting
542:44 - somewhere just need to make sure the
542:46 - token is valid um
542:58 - this question is do we need to validate
543:01 - the
543:02 - token I don't think we need to validate
543:04 - the token to be honest with you I'm
543:06 - going to go without validating it for
543:07 - now just get rid of
543:12 - this cuz now that I'm thinking of it I
543:14 - don't you don't really need to be
543:17 - validated cuz you can play as a guest
543:20 - it's not going to matter
543:24 - join a race true socket. on any is not a
543:27 - function damn
543:32 - it why is that
543:35 - why
543:45 - homepage give me some auto complete come
543:51 - on what even is this
544:03 - um where's the typo line 14
544:14 - where listen for any socket
544:22 - event socket client
544:25 - react this wasn't
544:40 - helpful no way anything's going to
544:46 - work I don't believe it
545:13 - [Music]
545:14 - I want to just listen for anything
545:43 - asteris no
545:45 - way I'm going to try that I don't think
545:47 - it's going to work let's try it
546:10 - that's fine console.log
546:27 - okay that worked it didn't emit anything
546:30 - back though user name is not valid
546:33 - that's why
546:37 - okay

556:40 - inspect
556:42 - inspect let's see
556:45 - this data okay boom sent it
556:53 - awesome let's
557:02 - go I don't know why it sent so many
557:04 - times
557:11 - though like oh my god look how many
557:13 - times is sending
557:17 - it what why is it sending it so many
557:20 - times um
557:26 - maybe I've joined the room like 12
557:31 - times uh let's
557:45 - see
557:47 - what it's like compounding like every
557:49 - time I do it it's sending more oh it's
557:51 - cuz I'm joining the room multiple times
557:53 - that actually is why because when I
557:54 - press join it's joining again
557:57 - um if I'm already joined it shouldn't
558:01 - join again um yeah that would be why
558:05 - um okay so I need to redirect once I
558:08 - join makes perfect sense okay that's
558:10 - good um so rather than just console.
558:12 - logging this will
558:16 - return wait join
558:19 - room on the join event I don't actually
558:22 - need to do anything there I want to
558:24 - admit joinan I want to join let's see if
558:27 - it says joinan then the thing is when I
558:30 - get that response back means I joined
558:34 - successfully so let's
558:36 - see
558:45 - um unjoin
558:47 - data no I think I just redirect to the
558:50 - room cuz now I'm joined this should work
558:52 - if I'm not
558:54 - not I think I just redirect to the room
558:57 - I don't think I need to wait for a
558:58 - response for that I think I just admit
559:00 - hey let me join I'm already connected
559:02 - the socket and it should allow me to
559:06 - join
559:08 - um that's going to there's going to be a
559:10 - problem with that but it's fine we'll
559:11 - use it for now
559:13 - history.
559:17 - push slash
559:20 - plus just un room
559:23 - okay let's do it um that should work
559:27 - then and then in the
559:29 - room oh we're moving now
559:31 - guys let's go to
559:35 - room take
559:40 - this
559:47 - homage what I want socket
559:54 - then here we'll set up an event
560:02 - handler
560:09 - yes say socket.
560:12 - on joyan
560:16 - handle user
560:17 - joint say const user join
560:22 - equals
560:26 - this
560:28 - log user
560:31 - joined take some Json in
560:34 - here
560:36 - okay handle user joined on there and
560:39 - then need to remove that
560:56 - okay uh use
561:07 - context
561:10 - okay Rim code that's
561:14 - [Music]
561:16 - good okay homepage
561:23 - should
561:24 - work um hey bro you good I'm all right
561:28 - we've been going yeah like someone said
561:29 - 9 hours 18 minutes almost at
561:39 - [Music]
561:47 - 12 refresh
561:50 - okay refresh
561:54 - join a race boom user joined join a race
561:57 - that didn't get the event
562:00 - though they're both in room
562:03 - one um user joined event was
562:12 - accepted should have said it in the
562:14 - other one
562:19 - though or should it have should have
562:30 - I'm admitting to join
562:33 - event should have happened in the other
562:42 - one do I need to use that damn call back
562:47 - thing maybe I'll just use it cuz I used
562:49 - it here and it seemed like it worked um
562:52 - uh
562:56 - okay Hamza thank you appreciate
563:20 - that I don't think that's going to make
563:21 - a difference
563:25 - so now I'm not connected to the socket
563:27 - which is the only problem if you go to a
563:28 - room and you're not connected I should
563:34 - actually yeah that's going to be a
563:36 - problem uh okay let's just go home go
563:39 - home join
563:40 - race join race should have got that
563:44 - message handle user joins
564:10 - when I redirect them do they get
564:13 - disconnected from the socket
564:28 - kind of confused uh why is that
564:32 - happening because it was working
564:35 - before okay let's just go here maybe we
564:39 - don't need to do it in a separate page
564:42 - we could just do it here set joint
564:45 - equals
564:46 - true and then if they joined don't have
564:50 - them join again
564:54 - actually this should happen
565:16 - after oh Nick white quit algo expert
565:19 - damn that's unfortunate man going to
565:21 - miss you
565:41 - ah yeah come work for me and help me set
565:44 - up sockets
565:48 - Nick okay home
565:56 - let's not
565:59 - redirect set join
566:01 - true leave this though M
566:04 - join then we'll do the on join
566:13 - [Music]
566:31 - where are you connecting SL defining the
566:33 - socket I'm using the
566:39 - context just remove this for now
566:57 - us joined
567:04 - okay user
567:11 - joined whoa why is it happening so many
567:14 - times
567:26 - I don't want to admit this if I've
567:28 - joined I'm setting it to be
567:36 - joined maybe because there's all these
567:38 - like things still going on
567:42 - um maybe because there's like seven call
567:45 - backs attached to it or something stupid
567:47 - it like keeps adding oh that's why it
567:51 - adds this Handler like a 100 times oh my
567:54 - God that's why that makes sense I have
567:56 - to do it in the uh in the use
567:59 - effect there you go now it should
568:03 - work fresh
568:06 - fresh join join boom happened once got
568:11 - it join join join yeah it's going to
568:15 - keep joining I don't know why it keeps
568:16 - joining though it shouldn't be joining
568:18 - multiple times cuz join is equal to True
568:21 - why is it setting
568:25 - again when I press it why is
568:28 - it is it setting
568:32 - joining the use effect is rendering
568:35 - again
568:37 - maybe I'm say if not join
569:16 - okay why is it happening so many
569:19 - times it's because of the event handlers
569:22 - 100% that's got to be what it
569:24 - is handle invite accepted I probably I
569:28 - can admit it in here that's
569:30 - fine AIT joined but I'm already joined
569:34 - why is this not working yeah I'm setting
569:37 - up socket rooms right now it's like kind
569:38 - of working but like not really um it
569:41 - just keeps calling this thing so many
569:43 - times I don't get
569:45 - it handle user joined join Rim maybe
569:49 - it's cuz this doesn't use the call back
569:50 - thing cuz it's submitting and then
569:52 - saying on this probably shouldn't be in
569:58 - here oh it's admitting user
570:01 - online I'm in I'm such an idiot oh my
570:03 - God I don't need to do this a 100
570:14 - times these can all get set up in
570:18 - here they don't need to be set up 25
570:21 - times okay um there you
570:26 - go now it should
570:28 - work probably not though let see I've
570:32 - done this exact thing what you should
570:34 - maybe do is have a custom URL for each
570:35 - room yeah that's actually exactly what
570:36 - I'm doing I am having custom URL for
570:38 - each Tri I'm just trying to connect to
570:40 - the socket first user joined but now
570:43 - it's not working on the other one H okay
570:47 - uh on join handle us join
570:54 - maybe maybe you could local storage a
570:56 - check maybe disable once the user joined
570:59 - yeah I think I found the the root of the
571:01 - problem here um if not joyan allow joyan
571:06 - says joyan that should omit or emit back
571:11 - um user
571:14 - online okay so it's we'll send the user
571:19 - online and then onjoin
571:26 - Quest handle invite
571:29 - accepted if not joined it lets you
571:35 - join this is what's not
571:37 - working
571:42 - um we're getting close here we're
571:44 - getting very close
572:11 - what do you mean maybe I can disable
572:12 - once the user joins I I have a I'm doing
572:16 - I've actually gotten like a decent
572:17 - progress right now but for some reason
572:19 - when the user joins
572:22 - it's
572:24 - admitting um it's not sending to the
572:27 - other one that is joined handle invite
572:29 - accepted handle user
572:31 - joined like let's just try this
572:37 - refresh okay
572:40 - join
572:49 - oh on join that was connected to the
572:52 - socket wait refresh so these are
572:54 - connected to the socket they haven't
572:57 - disconnected
572:59 - oh I need to send the disconnect it
573:02 - socket dot that's why oh my God okay
573:05 - socket. Amit what's the server look like
573:08 - I'll show you in a second Nick socket.
573:10 - Amit
573:12 - leave that's all I need to actually send
573:16 - there okay so if I refresh this it
573:18 - should leave right it should unbind me
573:21 - leave
573:27 - leave okay join see it's saying this guy
573:30 - joined which is good that that's
573:32 - supposed to happen
573:34 - um if I refresh this join is
573:38 - false boom there you go now it worked
573:41 - but watch this they both go to join true
573:44 - if I press this they both go to
573:48 - true but that's not that's not true okay
573:51 - if I go to
573:55 - homepage because I'm setting
573:57 - joined no matter what it needs to only
574:00 - be if I haven't joined
574:01 - already so it's set
574:04 - joined and then it receives the join
574:08 - request because it's admitting it back
574:10 - to everyone in the room handle user join
574:12 - should just do
574:14 - that join room if not join socket. admit
574:19 - okay um
574:23 - [Music]
574:32 - TR I'm going to restart the server and I
574:34 - think I can get it to work but this
574:35 - should
574:38 - leave handle use
574:44 - joined let's close this
574:52 - okay I'll sign
574:59 - [Music]
575:11 - in ready they both go to
575:15 - [Music]
575:19 - true cuz they're both getting
575:22 - the join request
575:25 - accepted handle invite accepted handle
575:29 - invite accepted set join
575:32 - true so they're both receiving
575:37 - that well how is it how are they both oh
575:39 - cuz when I press join
575:42 - room one of them joins user online joins
575:45 - but why is the other one are they the
575:46 - same thing is this not Incognito or
575:48 - something
575:52 - these need to be separate let's do
575:55 - this maybe they're the same freaking
575:57 - thing no these are different
576:00 - accounts this is not joined
576:04 - spe there you go now it worked fresh not
576:09 - joined
576:11 - join I guess that kind of makes sense
576:13 - but if I go if they're both here though
576:18 - like let's log out
576:21 - uh oh when I log out I got to leave the
576:23 - server too for
576:26 - sure yeah
576:29 - definitely although it should
576:32 - leave let's just do that in in there
576:35 - quickly though
576:37 - um socket where's my log out page
577:01 - [Music]
577:13 - okay
577:16 - fresh see it's saying it's not joined
577:20 - but it's still connected to the socket I
577:21 - think um I want actually an event for
577:25 - when I leave the
577:27 - thing so it tells me when I when I
577:30 - leave um
577:39 - [Music]
578:08 - when you click the button the event gets
578:09 - propagated by the server to all users
578:11 - all clients will handle it yes um I know
578:15 - that okay set join invite accept set
578:19 - join if not join set join yeah I mean it
578:22 - doesn't matter we can do that anyways I
578:23 - have eaten yep I have eaten guys don't
578:26 - worry I oh I'm still got to finish my
578:28 - chocolate bar here
578:42 - [Music]
578:59 - oh do I need to pass
579:03 - the yeah okay let's go
579:07 - [Music]
579:28 - you sound
579:29 - fun oh oh the room damn it that's not
579:34 - going to work how do I leave a room if I
579:36 - don't know what room I'm
579:47 - in oh this is so confusing
579:51 - and you just send events to the server
579:53 - right from the room let's see the
579:54 - leaving and joining should be handled on
579:56 - the server yes it is handled on the
579:57 - server um but it's just like it is
580:00 - handle on the server this is just
580:02 - telling me when someone else leaves or
580:03 - someone else joins get room
580:08 - ID okay ignore that for a
580:10 - second is there like a socket like hard
580:13 - disconnect or
580:15 - something where's Json not to find
580:17 - homepage
580:21 - yeah because I don't have the
580:29 - room so it joins me in a room but I need
580:33 - to know the
580:38 - room it's okay for
580:42 - now can I
580:48 - just when I'm on the room page I'll the
580:51 - room thing
581:00 - um oh you can use socket. leave oh
581:08 - dope all right socket. leave it is I
581:11 - don't think that's going to work on my
581:13 - flask back end to be honest with you I
581:14 - think it's going to glitch when I do
581:16 - that but hopefully that will work
581:23 - FSE
581:35 - okay us it
581:37 - joined but this guy joined too why does
581:40 - that keep
581:43 - happening it's cuz he must have already
581:45 - been in the for him to for this guy to
581:48 - accept that he has to already be a part
581:49 - of the room so
581:51 - let me try to log out what's this and
581:55 - see if it actually
581:59 - leaves log
582:01 - out socket. leave is not a
582:16 - [Music]
582:18 - function oh I can store the room in
582:20 - sessions flask I don't need to store it
582:25 - here socket
582:27 - doit I can just admit
582:37 - leave okay that's what we're going to
582:45 - do uh actually socket iio sessions let's
582:48 - see
582:59 - yeah okay let's see here
583:07 - uh
583:09 - socket flask socket session
583:29 - okay let's say flask
583:33 - sessions I can just literally use
583:35 - session
583:41 - right okay just do this I think this is
583:44 - what I used to this is definitely what I
583:46 - did previously when I did this
583:52 - I need to have something working by the
583:53 - end of this something needs to work some
583:55 - people need to be able to type against
583:56 - each other otherwise this is just a
583:58 - somewhat fail I mean I could continue
584:00 - this in another stream uh but ideally I
584:02 - would like to get something okay so
584:04 - onjoin room equals data room
584:09 - okay see like I don't need to be sending
584:12 - the room back this should just join when
584:14 - you do this
584:19 - um like it should just join the room on
584:22 - that oh man my brain is just
584:24 - malfunctioning here okay so we'll join
584:27 - room and then we'll say
584:30 - session uh
584:32 - room equals room okay and we'll say
584:39 - if
584:41 - room in
584:43 - session then room
584:47 - equals session
584:51 - room get rid of that leave
584:56 - room else
584:59 - return okay let's try
585:15 - this Tim five
585:29 - why let's just stop
585:33 - this make sure these guys aren't
585:35 - connected right
585:39 - now okay log in
586:03 - why is that happening does this auto
586:08 - connect like it's like this is already
586:11 - connected it needs to leave I'm going to
586:12 - make a button that says leave and just
586:14 - and just trigger it manually and
586:17 - see you should check if the user joins
586:19 - is the same user I'm I'm I'm reading
586:22 - your message but that's not going to
586:23 - help because the thing is there's no way
586:25 - that the other one should be getting
586:27 - that
586:28 - message right unless it's connected so
586:31 - it must already be connected which is
586:33 - the
586:34 - problem so let
586:36 - me try to fix
586:40 - that let's make a button should have
586:43 - done this a long time
586:45 - ago leave
587:14 - okay why does it already connect in the
587:17 - context should I do I have to restart
587:19 - the server or something for that that to
587:47 - work okay let me try
587:52 - but the context is not is not for every
587:55 - single person is it the context is like
587:58 - individual
588:00 - apps because of using git I doubt
588:07 - that okay at least the leave room thing
588:09 - should work
588:14 - now okay
588:23 - leave room doesn't do anything missing
588:25 - one require positional argument data uh
588:29 - let's go
588:35 - here
588:39 - okay it's the problem should be
588:49 - working us your left
588:51 - but that didn't get user
588:57 - left oh it's cuz I'm not setting join
588:59 - false okay let's try
589:00 - [Music]
589:07 - [Music]
589:14 - that socket connects when the user opens
589:17 - the
589:19 - page yes but they don't connect to the
589:22 - room so why are they getting
589:25 - sent cuz they're already in the
589:32 - room this is painful I'm sure everyone
589:34 - watching this is like what the
589:36 - heck uh this is hard I'm just too if
589:39 - this was at the beginning of the stream
589:40 - I'm sure this would be pretty
589:46 - easy join
589:49 - okay Jo join join okay leave see but
589:55 - it's only showing me user left here
589:56 - which I don't get why doesn't it show me
589:58 - user left here why doesn't it work over
590:02 - here right do you know what I mean like
590:04 - why would that not emit over
590:11 - oh
590:18 - what because that should work
590:24 - on leave handle user
590:29 - leave should be doing
590:33 - that I'm just confused how when I leave
590:35 - on one it doesn't send it to the other
590:41 - one maybe it's returning
590:52 - let me just print this
591:21 - [Music]
591:27 - [Music]
591:35 - what's what is this
591:36 - problem objects not Jon un
591:40 - serializable this is happening the room
591:43 - is not in the session
591:58 - [Music]
592:00 - session room that should be doing it
592:05 - though yeah maybe I do need to restart
592:07 - the
592:08 - server going have to sign in
592:11 - again you should have completed back in
592:13 - first well I can't like I'm trying to
592:15 - complete the backend but I need to need
592:16 - to test
592:24 - okay these guys are still signed in
592:26 - somehow oh because they have the tokens
592:27 - that's why oops don't open that
592:31 - okay uh join race user joined leave race
592:41 - problem maybe this is just not the way
592:44 - to check if something's in the session
592:46 - that's probably why
593:12 - that's really why
593:48 - that so the return either way is not
593:50 - going to work
593:53 - um I don't think I should have a return
593:55 - I think I should just not do
594:04 - anything session I get room so it's not
594:07 - in the session then like
594:09 - what why is it not in the session though
594:12 - don't understand
594:17 - why can I print the session
594:35 - objective type set is it printing
594:37 - anything room room
594:41 - room why
594:51 - I can't figure out where this is coming
594:54 - from
594:56 - oh oh my God guys I'm such an
595:04 - idiot it's going to work
595:13 - now so it is there
595:22 - [Music]
595:26 - it's just not admitting to the other
595:28 - people which I don't get I don't know
595:29 - why that's happening oh it's cuz when
595:32 - you leave you're not going to get it
595:34 - right
595:35 - but okay let's see join user joined
595:38 - leave user left leave user left but the
595:42 - thing is it doesn't tell me when the
595:43 - other user leaves it should be the other
595:45 - way around that's showing it to me
595:55 - only one room is being added to the
595:56 - session on the client all rooms are
595:58 - handling the join making all show true
596:00 - but only one is actually join serers
596:02 - side why how is why is that the
596:11 - case yeah this isn't just JavaScript
596:13 - that's why
596:15 - I'm the room is in the
596:17 - session uh when you join Ed room session
596:20 - it then adits the join event to all
596:21 - rooms setting the front has joined to
596:23 - True makes it look like all rooms have
596:28 - joined the thing is I thought I thought
596:32 - there's two separate connections like I
596:34 - thought that there
596:35 - was two different things being joined on
596:39 - so let's print the username and let's
596:41 - see if we're getting two different joint
596:42 - events um because also this is happening
596:45 - too right this this event here calling
596:49 - AIT leave after leave
597:03 - room print
597:06 - session print
597:10 - username on jooan
597:20 - okay let's do
597:34 - this okay so they're now connected to
597:36 - the
597:39 - socket no username
598:03 - I don't know guys this is so confusing
598:04 - this is
598:09 - frustrating the reason only one client
598:11 - is getting the leave event is that the
598:13 - if
598:24 - no that doesn't make
598:27 - sense let's just do
598:31 - [Music]
598:46 - this I don't know why that's happening
598:49 - when I press leave the other one should
598:51 - see
598:59 - it okay so the invite accepted things
599:01 - working let's just look at this
599:04 - here my mouse is lagging
599:15 - out join a room
599:28 - good needs because it needs to get the
599:30 - room to
599:31 - join
599:36 - um here I
599:45 - can let's do this
599:54 - maybe it's cuz it's emitting Leaf
600:17 - H my mouse is just lagging oh my God
600:31 - what the
600:41 - heck okay let's just go to room where
600:44 - API let's get rid of this

601:37 - here l in
601:57 - what okay there you
602:01 - go five
602:17 - at why is this happening internal server
602:20 - error uncaught in promise validate
602:25 - token

602:30 - server
602:36 - error name room is not

604:37 - Joan okay
604:55 - M to
605:13 - room should join
605:25 - yeah the server is getting the event I
605:28 - believe
605:31 - actually let's make
605:43 - sure oops
605:46 - join data
606:01 - see that's happening
606:03 - join and see that's happening join
606:05 - they're both
606:09 - joining and they both leave but they
606:12 - just don't transmit back to each other
606:14 - which I don't know why um because it
606:16 - should be it's listen it's clearly
606:18 - listening for the event it's it's
606:20 - emitting it back it's just not emitting
606:21 - it to the right room are they in
606:23 - different rooms how's that even possible
606:25 - oh do need to be a string or
606:30 - something maybe that's
606:38 - why no it's not
606:41 - why okay let's hardcode
606:44 - this
606:46 - room they should both be in the same
606:48 - room
607:01 - maybe I need to admit this before I
607:02 - leave no
607:05 - yes maybe before I leave the room I need
607:07 - to admit
607:17 - it they're both Jo joining they're just
607:20 - not admitting back to each other why I
607:24 - don't get
607:28 - [Music]
607:32 - it how how could the room IDs not be
607:36 - matching
607:38 - wait I literally hardcoded them as room
607:42 - they should all be joining the exact
607:43 - same room like I don't I really don't
607:46 - understand how this is the case
607:51 - join the room emits
607:54 - this other one joins the
607:57 - room oh thanks man appreciate it Nick
608:00 - yeah yeah I'm uh very happy with the new
608:03 - office shouldn't emit when a user joins
608:06 - shouldn't on leave print leave not join
608:09 - yeah it
608:11 - should joinan leave
608:23 - like I'm listening for the
608:25 - event and I'm not getting
608:35 - it join change join and leave our
608:41 - names where
609:02 - let's try
609:04 - this it like I literally had this
609:06 - working I've gone backwards
609:29 - says check the network tab let's
609:36 - see how would I even see
609:40 - this would it be
609:44 - here oh what
609:55 - okay let's see this
610:20 - no see it's not getting anything it's
610:21 - not sending it that's why that's the
610:23 - issue it's just not sending it to the
610:25 - correct
610:31 - thing wait
610:55 - nothing's
610:56 - happening okay something's happening
610:59 - here
611:02 - now no it's not getting the message
611:07 - though or is it just coming in really
611:13 - late okay let's try this
611:26 - let's try this without the rooms can we
611:29 - just join the socket and admit to like
611:32 - everyone cuz like I'm down to do that
611:34 - now um
611:53 - it's the server is not emitting it
611:54 - properly that's the
612:03 - issue let's try
612:07 - this okay enough of this this join room
612:10 - crap submit
612:20 - send
612:21 - room what is send
612:25 - room that might be something okay
612:27 - someone's knocking on my door be back in
612:29 - one sec
613:12 - all right yeah dude I don't know either
613:14 - I don't know why this isn't working 10
613:16 - hours um
613:52 - should I just copy this again and try it
613:54 - like okay
614:07 - refresh this okay now it's
614:10 - working I'm just broadcasting them to
614:12 - everyone use your
614:15 - left use your
614:17 - left okay
614:19 - okay
614:23 - nice okay uh how do
614:38 - you how do you just how do you
614:40 - disconnect
614:47 - them I've just done it so there 's no
614:49 - rooms now it's just like it's going to
614:50 - everyone so you can have like One race
614:53 - at a time like we we'll try to fix it
614:54 - after I guess but I don't know how to
615:00 - connect like how do I close the socket
615:03 - how do I actually disconnect it
615:33 - like I I don't want it to be a part of
615:35 - it anymore uh I guess I just removed the
615:43 - listeners I swear it should have its own
615:46 - thing for disconnection but it's not
615:48 - working
615:55 - handle user
615:59 - leave I mean if I do these it will stop
616:01 - listening for those events but how do I
616:04 - just get it to like fully disconnect
616:06 - socket. disconnect doesn't work I've
616:07 - tried
616:15 - it okay react
616:19 - socket
616:24 - disconnect
616:38 - [Music]
616:45 - client like I just don't know how to
616:47 - disconnect it this is annoying
616:50 - this is the problem using all these
616:52 - complicated
616:53 - Stacks
616:56 - okay user joined user joined leave room
617:00 - leave room like when you leave it should
617:02 - actually leave right
617:06 - um I guess we can just disconnect the
617:09 - event
617:11 - listeners when you leave
617:23 - I mean that'll work but not
617:29 - ideally okay let's try this
617:32 - join
617:35 - leave join okay yeah so now it doesn't
617:38 - show up on the other one but then this
617:39 - one doesn't show up either
617:41 - what are these guys are these the same
617:44 - things connected this makes no sense
617:52 - I don't
617:57 - understand since it's in the context is
617:59 - it like Global to the
618:02 - application is it because I'm on the
618:03 - same let me go on my
618:06 - phone maybe CU I'm on the same uh
618:09 - computer
618:10 - [Music]
618:16 - [Music]
618:19 - uh what's my IP
618:21 - address um is it going to say
618:26 - here do stop
618:35 - [Music]
618:52 - it's not a
619:11 - function okay I want
619:16 - to restart this
619:28 - oh smart Mark coming in clutch thank you
619:31 - very much Mark smart man very smart man
619:35 - extremely smart
619:38 - man okay that's why so it's it needs to
619:42 - be when only this client leaves but how
619:44 - do I check if it's just
619:47 - this um
619:50 - okay how do I check if it's just this
619:53 - client
619:56 - Json okay that's good now that I know
619:59 - that that that helps a lot okay let's go
620:02 - to run
620:04 - API let's try rooms
620:08 - again that's that's very good that's
620:10 - helpful that's very helpful okay um use
620:14 - a different event
620:16 - handler different event handler when I
620:19 - press leave oh nice yeah very very
620:22 - that's that makes perfect
620:26 - sense don't do it in the leave do it in
620:29 - leave
620:31 - room and then when they leave perfect oh
620:34 - my
620:36 - God see this is the problem with coding
620:38 - for 10 hours your brain just shuts off
620:41 - and these silly things like I should
620:42 - have been able to figure that out uh
620:45 - it's just not working okay leave room
620:47 - use a left and then leave
620:51 - room see it didn't
620:59 - disconnect why is that not unbinding
621:06 - it I have lost all my brain cells Gary
621:09 - yes I have
621:40 - no this is not why you add comments to
621:41 - code this is comments would not help me
621:43 - at all here um
621:55 - Ms
621:58 - leave make separate room
622:02 - ideas okay we're going to just try this
622:09 - again we're going to pull together all
622:11 - my brain power and restart this cuz I
622:15 - don't think this is helpful where where
622:17 - I'm at right now the committing of the
622:19 - join is fine the handling the user leave
622:21 - is fine the handling the user join is
622:23 - fine I think that's fine
622:27 - um that should be fine I don't think
622:30 - it's the JavaScript I think it's
622:34 - this
622:35 - okay
622:37 - now I do have water here let me have
622:39 - some water
622:55 - okay so let's just send room and

630:30 - honestly I should have just
630:35 - read this was an hour and a half long
630:37 - problem all I had to do was
630:42 - that to be fair none of you found it
630:45 - either so it's not just me joyan
630:50 - leave there we go joyan leave joyan
630:55 - leave okay nice that works now if this
630:59 - guy leaves and this guy joins it still
631:01 - says user join so it's working but it's
631:04 - not like leaving and joining the room
631:05 - though which I don't really get like
631:08 - join says join
631:12 - leave
631:14 - join shouldn't join for this one too
631:17 - leave
631:19 - cuz it should be it should be gone it
631:21 - should be out of the room
631:49 - I don't know why it's not leaving the
631:50 - room though that's what that's really
631:53 - confusing
631:54 - me well if they aren't joined then it
631:56 - shouldn't say I agree I agree it
631:58 - shouldn't say I don't know why they're
631:59 - joined they shouldn't be joined because
632:01 - they're not leaving is the problem
632:05 - um unless for some reason it's joining
632:07 - back somehow I don't
632:10 - know handle user leave that's all that's
632:13 - happening when it's user leave it says
632:15 - on leave
632:18 - message user left on joinan message user
632:22 - join so why do they start off
632:24 - joined I don't
632:29 - know connects to the
632:31 - socket he shouldn't be in the room by
632:34 - default let's just see what happens if I
632:36 - change the room well I can I can't
632:38 - because it's going to
632:42 - be that's true good idea go for a walk
632:45 - might help um what are you guys saying
633:06 - okay quest. Sid let's print this
633:26 - and

635:15 - it to still be in the room this should
635:17 - work work it should just

635:28 - it's not like it's still it just Auto
635:30 - joins back or
635:32 - something I have no idea I don't know

635:37 - room like it should be out of the
635:43 - room something's going on here in react

641:07 - they're seeing the same
641:11 - thing what that makes no sense
641:16 - [Music]
641:22 - [Music]
641:26 - that really that makes no sense that
641:27 - they're they're in different
641:29 - rooms dude I can't get the rooms this
641:32 - makes no I'm genuinely so confused I've
641:34 - used this before too which is the funny
641:35 - thing and it doesn't
641:39 - work like what is going
641:43 - on i' I've got the The Flash docks man
641:48 - it's just not very helpful because leave
641:50 - room doesn't seem to
641:57 - work I'll print it before and after and
641:59 - see if this literally does
642:03 - [Music]
642:13 - nothing I also have no idea how they
642:15 - would even be in different rooms
642:23 - see before and after they're in the same
642:26 - thing it doesn't
642:39 - leave where do leave room even come from
642:42 - try an if
642:45 - Loop let's just just go
642:51 - here and
642:54 - let
643:05 - no is there some way that it would be
643:08 - like Auto joining the room or something
643:10 - like I just don't get it I'm genuinely
643:13 - so confused I think it leaves in the
643:15 - leave room function right before your
643:17 - top print statement let's
643:22 - see oh
643:26 - true good
643:40 - call oh they're in two rooms how is it
643:44 - in like a default room
643:48 - so it is leaving that
643:54 - room it is leaving the room but it's in
643:56 - a default room how is it in that room oh
643:59 - it's in its own
644:02 - room is the broadcast
644:08 - true okay so that's working
644:35 - the default room is unique for you
644:37 - choose yeah
644:50 - it's in the room so it should be getting
644:53 - it when I leave the
644:56 - room it's still
644:58 - sending it's got to be this damn emit
645:01 - thing it must just not be working
645:12 - properly oh my God
645:42 - let's just try using
645:45 - send maybe AIT doesn't work for
646:06 - this s takes one positional argument
646:21 - maybe that's
646:28 - possible I want like the actual like
646:30 - full
646:32 - docks per send
646:52 - when a message is sent with the
646:53 - broadcast option enabled all clients
646:56 - connected to the name space receive it
646:59 - including the sender when name spaces
647:01 - are not used the clients connected to
647:03 - the global Nam space receive the message
647:05 - in all examples shown until this point
647:07 - the server responds to an event sent by
647:09 - the client for some applications the
647:11 - server needs to originate a
647:12 - message okay the socket. send and
647:15 - socket. methods can be used to to
647:16 - broadcast to all connected clients note
647:18 - that sock. send and so.it are not the
647:21 - same functions as the context where send
647:23 - and
647:29 - emit for many applications necessary to
647:32 - group users into subsets that can be add
647:34 - addressed together the best example is
647:35 - chat application with multiple rooms
647:38 - where users receive messages from the
647:40 - rooms or room room or rooms they in but
647:42 - not from other rooms
647:49 - okay the join and emit functions are
647:54 - optional except an optional argument
647:56 - that caused the message to be sent to
647:57 - All clients are in the given room all
647:59 - clients are assigned so I don't think
648:01 - broadcast equals true is the right thing
648:06 - here and I
648:11 - think this would be okay
648:35 - comma joinan
648:38 - okay joinan okay leave okay leave okay
648:44 - nothing's happening here
648:52 - [Music]
649:02 - H this is the problem I don't I think
649:05 - it's listening for a certain event and
649:08 - it's not getting the event that you need
649:10 - that it needs I think that like I need
649:13 - to admit a certain event cuz I don't
649:15 - know what the difference between send
649:17 - and amid is
649:29 - um h
649:40 - [Music]
649:54 - user
649:55 - joined user joined leave
650:00 - leave it's not sending it to the things
650:03 - in the
650:04 - room I don't understand why it's not
650:15 - working m adits a custom event okay
650:17 - that's what I
650:29 - want let's try
650:35 - this try using socket. on leave instead
650:38 - of off no the off is to unbind
650:41 - it let's try this
650:47 - if this makes a difference I swear to
650:53 - [Music]
650:59 - God no
651:11 - way oh my
651:15 - God it's literally I was using the wrong
651:19 - damn I'm going to hurt someone that this
651:22 - was like what why is that the problem it
651:24 - it's now working it's literally now
651:26 - working oh my
651:28 - God just those two damn methods see
651:33 - doesn't show it now I join boom shows me
651:35 - user joined I leave shows me user left
651:37 - user left I leave doesn't show me user
651:41 - left oh my God okay
651:47 - this is man this is so
651:50 - frustrating guys just cuz you I'm sorry
651:52 - if you suggested that this is uh my mind
651:55 - is is destroyed right

652:00 - annoying oh my God like these are the
652:02 - errors I've ran into all day so so so
652:07 - frustrating oh my god um yeah you guys
652:10 - are concerned over my health maybe you
652:11 - should be what's the difference I have
652:13 - no idea what the difference is one works
652:15 - and one doesn't that's all I care about
652:16 - right
652:17 - now okay well it's working so now we're
652:20 - going to redirect to the room page once
652:23 - we join so once we join and we get the
652:26 - user joined uh what we want to do is
652:29 - emit redirect and then we don't need
652:32 - these call backs right now um delete
652:37 - those delete
652:39 - those delete those delete
652:43 - those um this consist
652:48 - okay
652:50 - now get a nice nap after the stream I'm

666:31 - we
666:37 - back okay goal here what I would like to
666:41 - do is I would just like to make it so
666:44 - that we can see two people people typing
666:46 - on the screen at the same time and
666:47 - lifetime that's a goal if we can do that
666:49 - I'm going to be happy continue the
666:51 - stream another day because yeah I'm 50
666:54 - minutes and this brand power is not
666:56 - enough to finish this um kind of
666:58 - unfortunate but uh you know some stupid
667:00 - errors that's what happens when you
667:01 - write code that's usually why you don't
667:03 - write code for 12 hours
667:07 - straight all right let's get
667:10 - it okay stretch out
667:16 - let's have some more
667:18 - [Music]
667:21 - water what will we do next stream no
667:23 - idea but it won't be tomorrow I tell you
667:24 - that for sure maybe on uh no not Sunday
667:28 - uh Sunday is like the day Sunday's
667:30 - Mother's Day so probably not on Sunday
667:32 - have a good night thank you thank you to
667:33 - the 241 people here thank you very much
667:37 - thank you for staying with me believing
667:38 - in
667:41 - me okay so I also have an idea for the
667:44 - room I'm thinking I can make one I can
667:48 - make a button that generates a room and
667:50 - then a button to join a room and when
667:52 - you join the room you can pick the room
667:53 - to join um and you just type in the room
667:55 - you want to join and it will bring you
667:57 - there and then um I'm thinking that I
668:01 - can do create room and it will just
668:03 - randomly generate a uyu ID which is like
668:06 - guaranteed to be unique don't know how
668:07 - they do that but I think I think we'll
668:09 - just go with that uh and then yeah so
668:12 - rather than like it automatically
668:13 - handling the the room thing
668:16 - thing yeah that's that's what I'm
668:18 - thinking but let's just see if we can
668:20 - get something working we can handle the
668:21 - rims after I want to get live chat I
668:24 - want two code Windows one on the left
668:26 - one on the right someone can type in the
668:28 - left someone can type in the right going
668:30 - to do this in the most inefficient way
668:32 - possible and yeah let's go for it all
668:35 - right okay so material
668:39 - UI text field we're going to keep it
668:42 - simple
668:43 - um okay just woke up yeah I've just been
668:47 - honestly I forgot I should just drink a
668:49 - ton of water I thought the Red Bull was
668:50 - going to be helpful but the water's
668:52 - actually way more
668:56 - helpful I want like a large text
669:00 - field how do I get a large like big text
669:06 - input you you like text box
669:14 - maybe text area that's what it's
669:22 - called no not text
669:28 - field
669:35 - Hy
669:37 - input actually I think I can use
669:41 - this dope got it okay Rose Max
669:46 - Infinity nice okay so let's go
669:52 - here
670:06 - Port F UI
670:09 - slore
670:11 - okay line Rose Max equals
670:19 - Infinity
670:29 - placeholder can you guys hear my cat
670:31 - crying
670:46 - uh she was crying okay let's go here see
670:52 - con um
671:23 - [Music]
671:25 - okay and go
671:28 - equals ponent
671:32 - type and user type so let's do
671:38 - this grid
671:41 - okay and
671:44 - grid
671:46 - container
671:52 - okay
671:54 - and
671:56 - CR
672:13 - item okay
672:17 - Direction equals
672:20 - row okay accs equal
672:24 - 6 equals
672:29 - 6 okay
672:33 - um yeah no I'm I'm not going to be able
672:35 - to complete it in in the next hour but
672:37 - I'll get like
672:38 - hopefully something that
672:41 - works okay um
672:45 - let see type
672:52 - type ponent
672:55 - type ponent
672:58 - type okay I'm trying to
673:02 - think how I want to send over the text
673:08 - Data h i could do it one character at a
673:11 - time but that's going to be really hard
673:13 - so I'm just going to do what ever is in
673:15 - the text field on change I'm going to
673:17 - send so let's say on
673:20 - change equals okay and no this doesn't
673:26 - need that this needs
673:33 - this Mr colon where did
673:37 - mron okay onchange
673:41 - equals send updated
673:46 - code
673:57 - okay
674:02 - admit
674:10 - code okay and then
674:15 - send update
674:25 - code
674:30 - Type okay now let's
674:38 - go const handle
674:52 - actually it's going to be equal to
675:20 - data code
675:24 - okay
675:25 - now socket.
675:32 - on want
675:38 - update okay put update code
676:12 - fine data um
676:19 - code in data
676:21 - okay um yeah I am a zombie don't
676:26 - worry I'm just trying to go kind of fast
676:28 - it's I'm trying to focus so that I can
676:29 - actually get something done so that this
676:30 - works um yeah okay uh anyways let's see
676:35 - here if code in data then code equals
676:39 - data at code and then we're going to say
676:47 - socket out. admit
676:48 - [Music]
676:49 - leave um to
676:52 - room okay we're going to
676:56 - say
676:58 - session
677:01 - room room okay and we're going to
677:06 - say
677:08 - session. getet room okay we're going to
677:13 - pass that code data so now I want to
677:15 - admit to
677:17 - everyone but not the same client um
677:22 - actually this will be fine this will
677:23 - still work the way it is yeah this
677:25 - should actually still work um I
677:32 - think
677:34 - maybe we'll see
677:38 - okay actually we can just do this
677:43 - data okay
677:46 - so now let's just
677:49 - go print data okay so here we're going
677:56 - to emit our updated code okay let's just
678:00 - run this see if anything Works don't
678:04 - need
678:07 - that opponent typing start
678:13 - typing yeah I figured that wasn't going
678:15 - to work name socket is not
678:17 - defined socket

688:59 - [Music]
689:07 - so it's always one character
689:10 - behind it's interesting
689:21 - wait let's see if I can figure out why
689:23 - this is the
689:34 - case I think that's
689:37 - [Music]
689:40 - it there you go
689:49 - boom let's go
689:52 - leave didn't trigger the leave
689:56 - event and here I don't think is it is it

690:05 - here left okay don't need that uh let's
690:09 - go
690:10 - here for some reason it doesn't look
690:12 - like it's emitting the leave event
690:42 - that worked
690:44 - oh there you
690:53 - go okay
691:02 - nice okay so let's
691:06 - now throw in an error if their opponent
691:10 - leaves
691:20 - gu don't need
691:22 - that let's
691:25 - say an error so if they leave if handle
691:29 - leave then set
691:32 - [Music]
691:34 - error opponent is left you
691:38 - one uh should that be error maybe that
691:41 - should be info
691:44 - set
691:45 - info and then
691:49 - info
691:50 - set
691:52 - info
691:53 - then
691:57 - info info wait actually is info one yeah
692:01 - I think info is one set
692:06 - info info
692:11 - okay oh that's sweet and then when they
692:13 - join I can do the same thing too okay
692:17 - um handle
692:31 - joyan nice
692:37 - okay okay join the
692:39 - race wait what oh
692:44 - it's cuz it's it doesn't know if it's
692:46 - itself or not makes sense okay let's do
692:50 - the thing so it only sends back to
692:51 - itself okay includes self or doesn't
692:53 - send back to itself
692:59 - okay nice okay boom

693:17 - race didn't
693:27 - work that should
693:34 - update h
693:49 - maybe this doesn't work in a use call
693:55 - back cuz I think
694:08 - it log join
694:22 - left
694:25 - no
694:27 - oh that that's why I have an issue on
694:30 - the API oh my God what am I
694:37 - doing that's
694:41 - why I was like what the heck's going on
694:43 - how do I break everything okay now it's
694:54 - good that's that's not correct
695:25 - [Music]

696:18 - I want to move that down
696:20 - lower
696:22 - um
696:25 - sweet also need to render a code block
696:28 - they need to start typing so once both
696:29 - people are in needs to show a code block
696:36 - um are you using any python framework
696:39 - I'm using
696:40 - flask okay let's think about this
696:50 - okay it is it is here let's just try
696:51 - this again join race join the race your
696:53 - opponent has joined get ready um and
696:56 - then that should show if he's joining a
696:58 - room where his opponent's already joined
697:02 - um so if it gets this message it should
697:05 - broadcast something to this
697:07 - guy yeah that makes sense we can do that
697:15 - oh we'll do like a starting message that
697:17 - would work okay broadcast start run
697:22 - API so can I check how many people are
697:26 - in a
697:27 - room
697:29 - um flask check how many users in room
697:47 - socket io.
697:48 - rooms is that going to work let's try
697:52 - this do don't
697:58 - join and then your room and then this
698:01 - will be room okay let's just look at
698:04 - this
698:19 - uh leave room leave room okay join
698:22 - race has no attribute

699:43 - me anything super valid
699:48 - but what was this what did this say at
699:50 - the
699:51 - top
699:52 - [Music]
699:58 - rooms see this was an annoying thing
700:00 - rooms worked but room didn't last time
700:03 - see if that import
700:05 - fails can import room but I can import
700:11 - rooms what is rooms
700:13 - that gives me a list what if I just do
700:16 - rims
700:47 - yeah it's not helpful it's just give me
700:48 - the rooms the users in I want the room I
700:50 - want all of the users in a
700:56 - room I need to know
701:07 - that that was in 2015 okay get room
701:11 - client
701:25 - rooms socket
701:40 - ID get room client what is
701:58 - that where is connected
702:06 - users I don't it doesn't look like this
702:08 - is possible
702:40 - H okay let's see here
702:47 - okay I'm trying to figure out the number
702:49 - of users that are in a room and
702:52 - apparently that's not an easy thing to
702:54 - do because I want
702:57 - to like start well let's see here the
703:02 - user that creates the room I mean
703:03 - theoretically it can start the race I
703:05 - guess but I don't really like starting
703:06 - the race from the front end I'd prefer
703:08 - to start from the back end uh I could
703:10 - keep track of room
703:13 - and
703:15 - then try to use a database or something
703:19 - to determine how many are there that's
703:21 - seems like a pain though um H could
703:25 - insert the room into the database when a
703:27 - user connects I could insert them and
703:28 - then that would tell me how many people
703:29 - I
703:31 - have okay we can try that um
703:38 - models I forgot about this
703:53 - let's say ID equals db. column now let's
703:58 - go here to
704:09 - this okay
704:22 - how do I make a list in the database
704:26 - text okay hey Mouse stop
