00:02 - hey guys uh welcome back to another
00:03 - video this is the fifth video in my
00:06 - Python Programming series and today
00:08 - we're going to be talking about chained
00:09 - conditionals and nested if statements um
00:13 - so pretty much chained conditionals are
00:15 - just adding multiple conditions in one
00:18 - uh one line with using words like and
00:22 - and or okay uh we also have keyword not
00:25 - that we're going to talk about as well
00:27 - so if you haven't seen the last videos
00:29 - in my series go ahead and get watch
00:31 - those now because they are prerequisite
00:33 - for this video all right so let's get
00:35 - right ahead and start um so if you
00:37 - remember before we have something called
00:39 - conditions so for example if we have the
00:41 - variable X I'll set that to two and the
00:43 - variable Y which is equal to three we
00:45 - could have a condition like x equal
00:46 - equal y now obviously we know from the
00:49 - last video that this is going to give us
00:51 - a value of
00:52 - false oops and I cannot type today sorry
00:57 - um and that is because 2 is not equal to
00:59 - three pretty straightforward I hope you
01:01 - have all understood that from the last
01:03 - video all right so what we want to do in
01:06 - this now is we're going to want to check
01:07 - multiple conditions um so we'll put a
01:10 - condition here so if x is equal to Y and
01:13 - then we can put a word in like this the
01:17 - andw um now we'll add another condition
01:19 - so if x +
01:22 - y is equal to five okay so this first
01:27 - condition is going to give us a value of
01:29 - false so if X is equal to Y because they
01:31 - are not the same but now x + y does
01:34 - indeed equal 5 so that is going to give
01:37 - us a value of true so where I'm
01:39 - highlighting we have true and then where
01:40 - I'm highlighting now again we have false
01:43 - so because we have the keyword and this
01:46 - if statement is not going to run so I'll
01:49 - put a print here just to show you we're
01:51 - going to print out true or let's just
01:54 - say
01:55 - ran and you'll see when I run the
01:57 - program nothing is going to happen that
02:00 - is because when we use the and keyword
02:02 - it means both conditions on either side
02:04 - must be true so if we change this to
02:07 - something like if Y is equal to 3 now
02:12 - that is going to be
02:13 - true and we'll print out
02:16 - ran okay so that's pretty basic now
02:18 - let's do the or keyword so we'll put or
02:22 - right here and we'll change this
02:24 - condition back to if Y is equal to X and
02:27 - now take a guess on what you think is
02:29 - going to happen
02:31 - well pretty much with the or keyword it
02:33 - means either of the conditions have to
02:35 - be true so if Y is equal to X or x + y
02:40 - is equal to 5 then we are going to run
02:43 - this line now since x + y does equal
02:46 - five we have a true here and again Y is
02:48 - not equal to X so we have a false and
02:50 - you'll see that the program is going to
02:52 - run that's because only one of the
02:54 - condition conditions has to be true for
02:57 - it to
02:58 - run Okay so so that is the and in the OR
03:01 - keyword they are pretty straightforward
03:02 - and pretty basic now I'd like to point
03:05 - out that you can actually add as many
03:07 - conditions as you'd like so now I can
03:09 - have an or I can have an and um I could
03:12 - have another condition I could do as
03:14 - many as I possibly can imagine as many
03:16 - as I'd like to do um so now we'll put an
03:19 - lse statement in here and we'll change
03:22 - this just a little bit to use another
03:26 - keyword we'll just put a sad face here
03:28 - to show that we didn't run it
03:30 - that we ran the else okay um so now
03:32 - there's something called the not word
03:34 - okay so we're going to put not right
03:36 - here around it and then I will show you
03:38 - what it does so pretty much notot
03:40 - reverses anything that you have inside
03:43 - of the brackets of the knot so in here
03:46 - we have if Y is equal to X or x + y is
03:50 - equal to 5 so we know again that this
03:51 - gives us a value of true um so now since
03:55 - true is inside of the not true becomes
03:58 - false now we have if false um so
04:02 - obviously that's going to bring us to
04:03 - the else statement um which is going to
04:05 - print the sad face so I'll show you that
04:08 - that does indeed work so we have the sad
04:11 - face right now if we change these so
04:13 - that both of these conditions are false
04:15 - you'll see that we have false false um
04:18 - which is going to give us an overall
04:19 - value of false um and then we're going
04:22 - to have the not which is going to change
04:23 - that into a true and will allow us to
04:25 - run it just like that ran um so yeah so
04:30 - that's how the not the end and the or
04:32 - work uh and now let's get into nested
04:35 - Loops or sorry not nested Loops Nest
04:38 - nested if statements so we'll do a basic
04:41 - if statement here if x is equal to
04:44 - 2 um if Y is equal to
04:48 - 3 um and then we'll add our
04:52 - El's like this and we'll put some print
04:55 - statements in here
05:01 - okay uh just give me a second while I
05:03 - type out the print statements and then
05:05 - we will go into what this is going to
05:08 - do x = 2 and Y = 3 um so you may have
05:14 - guessed already but pretty much we can
05:18 - actually add as many if statements
05:20 - embedded or nested as we'd like so I
05:22 - could add another if statement here and
05:23 - just constantly keep checking um now the
05:26 - reason I showed you chain conditionals
05:28 - is because if I didn't want to go
05:30 - through the hassle of adding all of
05:32 - these uh nested statements I could just
05:35 - do an and right here and check for
05:38 - another condition but sometimes we do
05:39 - want to do uh nested statements so we'll
05:42 - say here x = 2 y does not
05:46 - equal uh what is it
05:49 - three okay so uh I know I just did that
05:51 - pretty quickly but let's walk through it
05:53 - now so we have if x is equal to 2 then
05:56 - we're going to run whatever is in here
05:59 - because it is indented uh so now we come
06:01 - in here and we say well is y equal to 3
06:04 - let's say it is now we're going to print
06:06 - out this statement and we're going to be
06:07 - done with this loop with this uh bit of
06:10 - code so we're going to skip down to the
06:12 - end of the program where we have nothing
06:13 - else um then so let's say we do another
06:16 - example X is equal to 2 but y equal 4 so
06:20 - that means we're actually going to run
06:21 - the else which means now we've got print
06:24 - X is equal to 2 but y does not equal 3
06:27 - and then the last case is X is not equal
06:30 - to 2 so we don't even bother checking if
06:32 - Y is equal to 3 we just go down and we
06:34 - print X does not equal 2 so we'll change
06:38 - around the variables and we'll show you
06:39 - how this works just very
06:41 - quickly so we can see X is equal to 2
06:43 - and Y is equal to 3 that is because
06:45 - obviously up here two and three now if I
06:47 - want to change Y and we change it to
06:50 - four we get X is equal to 2 but Y is not
06:54 - equal to three so that means we ran this
06:56 - one in
06:57 - here now let's change it so that X is
07:00 - equal to 4 as
07:02 - well and we can see we get X does not
07:06 - equal
07:07 - 2 all right so that's uh the basics on
07:10 - nested statements and chained
07:12 - conditionals I hope you found this video
07:14 - helpful um stay tuned for more videos
07:17 - we're going to be getting into some more
07:19 - advanced topics and in the next video
07:20 - we're going to be covering
07:22 - Loops um yeah so if you like the video
