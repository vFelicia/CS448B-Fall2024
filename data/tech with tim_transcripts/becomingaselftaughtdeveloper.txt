00:00 - how long should it take you to become a
00:01 - self-taught developer well this varies
00:03 - from person to person and based on the
00:05 - level of knowledge you want to have in a
00:07 - specific programming Niche like front
00:08 - end back end Etc but the reality is
00:10 - there's a finite set of topics that
00:13 - every developer is kind of expected to
00:15 - know and I would imagine that if you
00:16 - were doing this fairly seriously you had
00:18 - a good plan and a solid curriculum that
00:20 - you were following and you were very
00:22 - focused you could learn all of the
00:24 - topics you needed in under six months
00:26 - I've seen some people do this in three
00:28 - or four months I've seen other people
00:29 - take a full a year it depends again on
00:31 - your focus the type of curriculum you're
00:33 - following and the time commitment you're
00:35 - putting into it but I'd say for most of
00:37 - you if you're really serious about
00:38 - becoming a developer you could do it in
00:40 - about six months now if you want a full
00:42 - curriculum of topics you can follow you
00:44 - can check out my course programming
00:45 - expert you don't have to buy the course
00:47 - you can just look at the curriculum and
00:49 - see what we're recommending to get to a
00:51 - junior Dev position as fast as possible
