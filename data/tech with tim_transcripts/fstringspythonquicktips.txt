00:00 - in this video I'll be showing you how to
00:01 - use f strings a faster way to construct
00:03 - strings in Python that does not involve
00:05 - the use of something like format % or
00:08 - simply adding strings together using the
00:10 - plus sign
00:11 - now without our previous knowledge of f
00:13 - strings if we wanted to create a string
00:15 - that said my name is the variable name
00:16 - and I am the variable age years old
00:19 - these are the three ways we would
00:20 - probably go about doing that the first
00:22 - way is definitely the most tedious
00:24 - having to add strings together and then
00:26 - converting our integers into strengths
00:28 - that we can add them in here and the
00:30 - second way is annoying as well we have
00:31 - to format with 0 1 keep track of those
00:34 - indexes and then add adult format at the
00:36 - end of the string and then lastly we
00:38 - have this method with the percent signs
00:39 - where we can do % s % I name age now a
00:43 - much faster way to do this is using F
00:45 - strings so what is an F string what F
00:47 - string is simply a string that starts
00:49 - with a lowercase or capital F now if the
00:51 - string could obviously be single or
00:53 - double quotation marks and again it
00:54 - doesn't matter if it's capital or
00:56 - lowercase and what we can do is simply
00:57 - type my name is and put any variables or
01:01 - expressions that aren't a string inside
01:03 - of curly braces and this will evaluate
01:05 - it as a string so my name is Tim and I
01:07 - am in this case age years bold now we
01:14 - can do things like add values in here so
01:16 - H plus 4 H + 5 the values of course
01:19 - don't have to be strings as age is a
01:21 - number and this will work fine so let me
01:23 - prove it to you by printing ex4 like
01:27 - that we'll have a look at it now and you
01:29 - can see my name is Tim and I am 19 years
01:30 - old and that does indeed work so that is
01:33 - how f strings work they're very useful
01:34 - you can put them directly inside print
01:36 - statements as well inside function calls
01:38 - inside whatever you want and they just
01:39 - save you a lot of time and avoid kind of
01:41 - this massive doing the percents and the
01:43 - formats and all of that
