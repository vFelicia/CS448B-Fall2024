00:00 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:02 - youtube video
00:03 - so in today's video i'm going to be
00:05 - comparing the compensation for your
00:06 - typical
00:07 - software engineer to someone who
00:09 - actually works on youtube as a tech
00:11 - influencer or software engineering
00:13 - influencer or whatever you want to call
00:15 - it now the reason i'm making this video
00:17 - is because the other day i was looking
00:18 - at kind of the top
00:19 - tech channels or top software
00:21 - engineering channels on youtube
00:23 - and i realized that most the people that
00:24 - run these channels
00:26 - actually do not work as software
00:28 - engineers they may have worked as a
00:30 - software engineer previously maybe they
00:31 - were at facebook or amazon or something
00:33 - and then they quit and they started
00:34 - doing youtube
00:35 - but my idea behind this was that they
00:37 - must be making a good amount of money
00:39 - from their youtube channels
00:40 - if they're not actually working as a
00:42 - software engineer because the
00:44 - salaries for software engineers are so
00:46 - ridiculously high especially at these
00:48 - big tech companies
00:49 - now as someone that has both worked as a
00:51 - software engineer as an intern full
00:53 - disclosure there
00:54 - as well as runs a pretty large youtube
00:56 - channel i have a pretty good idea of how
00:57 - much
00:58 - money you make doing both of these
00:59 - things and well i wanted to compare them
01:01 - here and give you guys kind of a behind
01:02 - the scenes and inside scoop
01:04 - into how much youtubers are really
01:06 - making so that said
01:07 - let's go ahead and get started and i'll
01:09 - talk to you about how much youtubers
01:10 - make
01:10 - versus software engineers
01:15 - [Music]
01:21 - all right so we're going to dive in in
01:22 - just one second i've got a bunch of
01:24 - information to share with you on the
01:25 - computer we're going to go to a
01:26 - screencast in just a minute
01:28 - but i want to quickly state that it's
01:30 - pretty well known how much software
01:31 - engineers make right
01:32 - you can go to the internet you can look
01:34 - at videos you can go and look at
01:36 - specific websites that have listings of
01:38 - all of the different salaries
01:39 - and well for you guys you can probably
01:41 - figure out that information pretty
01:42 - easily
01:43 - the number that i'm sure you guys are
01:44 - curious about is how much a youtuber
01:46 - would actually make
01:47 - now obviously this is a lot harder to
01:49 - determine and when i go through these
01:51 - numbers in just a second
01:53 - i'm going to be using kind of my
01:54 - personal experience and my understanding
01:56 - of how
01:56 - this this channel and this business
01:58 - really generates revenue
02:00 - and applying that to kind of a sample
02:01 - channel and we'll pick some numbers and
02:03 - you'll see how that works
02:04 - but there's a lot of ways in which
02:05 - youtubers make money which people don't
02:07 - realize
02:08 - and one of the main ways is actually
02:10 - sponsorships like this one
02:12 - now if being a youtuber is not your
02:14 - thing and you want to become a software
02:15 - engineer
02:16 - you need to check out algoexpert.io

03:00 - with tim
03:00 - for a discount on the platform all right
03:02 - so i'm here
03:03 - on the computer and the first thing i'm
03:05 - going to do is share with you the
03:06 - average salaries
03:07 - at large tech companies for software
03:10 - engineers
03:10 - specifically i'm going to show you how
03:12 - much google pays their employees and how
03:14 - much facebook pays their employees
03:15 - i want to be really clear here this
03:17 - information i'm about to show you is
03:19 - crowdsourced so i
03:20 - obviously cannot validate the accuracy
03:22 - of this information
03:23 - i have never worked at google or
03:25 - facebook i know people that have and i
03:27 - know
03:27 - there's salaries that they've shared
03:29 - with me but again this is crowdsource so
03:31 - keep that in mind
03:32 - this could be wrong this could be
03:33 - slightly inaccurate but i know this site
03:35 - to be pretty reliable and i know a lot
03:37 - of people in the software engineering
03:38 - industry
03:39 - that have you know somewhat validated
03:40 - that what is on this site is
03:42 - is pretty valid and pretty accurate so
03:44 - keep that in mind
03:45 - anyways before i show you this and
03:47 - actually talk more about this website
03:49 - i want to quickly mention that the
03:50 - numbers you're about to see here are not
03:52 - representative of the average software
03:54 - engineering salary
03:55 - in fact i looked it up before this video
03:57 - to make sure i wasn't misleading anyone
03:59 - in the united states as of 2019
04:01 - according to indeed.com
04:03 - the average uh software engineering
04:05 - salary was 107
04:07 - 000 us dollars with an average bonus of
04:09 - 4
04:10 - 000 us dollars so still a lot of money
04:12 - you can make a bunch of money working as
04:14 - a software engineer software engineers
04:15 - are paid
04:16 - very well but that is nothing compared
04:18 - to what you're going to see here for
04:19 - google and facebook
04:20 - all right so let's dive into these
04:22 - numbers i'm going to be comparing google
04:23 - and facebook and
04:24 - let's start with an entry or new grad
04:27 - so l3 is uh google's i guess like entry
04:30 - level engineer and e3 would be
04:32 - facebook's entry-level engineer so l3 at
04:35 - google has a total compensation
04:37 - according to this website
04:38 - of 187 826
04:42 - dollars again remember this is an
04:43 - estimate the salary they're stating is
04:45 - supposed to be about 128
04:47 - 000 us dollars a year and then 38 000 in
04:50 - stock
04:51 - per year i believe when you work at
04:53 - these companies you get vested stock
04:54 - over three or four years
04:56 - so they'll say something like hey we're
04:57 - gonna give you a hundred twenty thousand
04:59 - dollars in stock
05:00 - over three years then you have a
05:02 - targeted bonus of
05:03 - twenty thousand dollars that seems about
05:05 - right most people i know that work at
05:07 - these companies
05:07 - tell me that they're targeting a bonus
05:09 - about 15 to 20 percent
05:11 - per year of their base salary so anyways
05:13 - that is what it is for l3 at google
05:15 - this is a lot of money right this is
05:17 - almost close to double what the average
05:19 - salary is for software engineers in
05:21 - general in the us
05:23 - next let's move over to e3 at facebook
05:25 - this is 179
05:27 - 000 so pretty close to what it was at
05:29 - google and well i mean you guys can read
05:31 - the numbers for yourself
05:32 - let's just kind of go down and i'll go
05:33 - through these quickly because i'm sure
05:34 - you guys can look at the website if you
05:36 - want to see it
05:37 - anyways level four i believe this is
05:39 - usually once you've worked about two
05:40 - years or maybe one and a half two years
05:42 - depending on how good you are
05:43 - you get promoted to an l4 and your
05:46 - salary is 155 000.
05:48 - stock is 80 000 a year bonus 27 000
05:52 - total comp 263 which is a lot of money
05:55 - moving over e4 uh very similar so it
05:58 - seems like facebook is just slightly
06:00 - lower
06:00 - than google and while you guys can read
06:02 - the numbers here yourself
06:03 - uh yeah they're pretty much the same all
06:05 - right so now moving over to l5
06:07 - this is a senior software engineer i'm
06:10 - not sure how long it would typically
06:11 - take you to get into this position but
06:13 - if i had to guess i would say probably
06:15 - four or five maybe six years uh but you
06:17 - would definitely have to work at a
06:18 - company for more than you know two or
06:20 - three years to get to this
06:21 - position anyways total compensation of
06:23 - 351
06:25 - 000 you can see the stock didn't really
06:27 - go up a ton or sorry not the stock the
06:29 - salary didn't really go up a ton
06:31 - but the stock is significantly higher
06:33 - and that's kind of the trend as we go
06:34 - through this list
06:36 - anyways you can read the numbers we'll
06:37 - move over to e5 at facebook
06:39 - 377 000 wow so that's actually more than
06:42 - l5 at google so that's kind of strange
06:44 - considering the other ones
06:46 - and then we can look at l6 and i'll kind
06:48 - of stop after that because it's not
06:50 - realistic that most people are going to
06:51 - work any higher than this
06:52 - anyways l6 493 000 us dollars a year
06:56 - that is
06:56 - a lot of money salary 225 stock
07:00 - to 11 and then let's look at facebook
07:02 - this is
07:03 - 572. wow so that is actually
07:05 - significantly higher
07:06 - than google i just give you a quick
07:09 - sneak peek we'll go to staff software
07:10 - engineer 642
07:12 - e7 838 geez l8
07:16 - this is 1.2 million dollars a year e8
07:19 - 1.2 l9 they don't have any estimates but
07:23 - someone's saying 1.75
07:26 - million jesus and yeah i guess they
07:28 - don't have that for this either anyways
07:30 - that is kind of the salaries that you
07:32 - could earn at a big tech company
07:34 - i'm going to imagine and we're going to
07:35 - kind of compare it to this salary right
07:37 - here l5 at google
07:38 - so a senior software engineer that is
07:40 - realistic most people aren't going to
07:42 - work or
07:42 - be in a position higher than this okay
07:45 - so 351 let's put that down as kind of
07:47 - like the highest you would make working
07:49 - at a big tech company at least as an
07:51 - average employee
07:52 - and now let's move over and talk about
07:54 - how much youtubers are going to make
07:55 - compared to that
07:57 - alright so i'm here we're going to start
07:58 - doing the exciting stuff which is
07:59 - looking at how much the average youtuber
08:02 - would make
08:02 - now i'm going to be looking at large
08:04 - channels with the specific spreadsheet
08:06 - i've set up here
08:07 - as soon as you kind of drop the number
08:09 - of subscribers that we punch into this
08:11 - spreadsheet below a hundred thousand
08:13 - or even maybe let's say below 150 000 or
08:16 - 200
08:17 - 000 this is probably not going to be
08:18 - very accurate so keep that in mind and
08:20 - same thing once you go over about a
08:22 - million subscribers
08:23 - this probably is not going to be very
08:24 - accurate as well it's very difficult to
08:27 - actually estimate
08:28 - how much a youtuber or content creator
08:30 - really makes
08:31 - because there's so many different ways
08:32 - to make money online and a lot of the
08:35 - richest content creators
08:36 - do not make a majority of their money
08:38 - from the primary thing that you see them
08:40 - do
08:40 - they will make a lot of money from say
08:42 - selling courses or from doing small
08:44 - things on the side like merchandise
08:46 - that you wouldn't necessarily kind of
08:48 - know about or you wouldn't really be
08:50 - able to figure out
08:50 - how much they're really earning from
08:52 - that specific source so i'm going to try
08:54 - my best to give you the best estimate
08:56 - that i can
08:56 - but keep that in mind i'm not perfect
08:58 - this spreadsheet is not perfect and i've
09:00 - made a lot of assumptions here
09:02 - that are based on how the finance and
09:04 - kind of business side works for my
09:06 - specific company
09:07 - and my specific youtube channel anyways
09:10 - let's dive in so here the way the
09:13 - spreadsheet works is you fill in
09:14 - these values in the youtuber stats
09:16 - section and then based on those values
09:18 - it will populate these tables with the
09:19 - correct numbers
09:20 - so numbers you see right now are not
09:22 - accurate at all some of them are just
09:23 - hard coded in because it's
09:25 - it just only makes sense to put them in
09:26 - that way but just keep that in mind like
09:28 - negative 18 000 is obviously not
09:31 - you know the corporate net income all
09:33 - right so let's get started here and then
09:34 - i'll talk about all the tables as we go
09:36 - through so if you're confused by any of
09:37 - this don't worry
09:38 - but let's pick a channel that has say
09:40 - 800 000 subscribers
09:42 - and try to figure out how much money
09:44 - they would really make so put 800 000
09:46 - in there now we have to pick the monthly
09:48 - views for this channel
09:50 - so if i'm looking at my channel i get
09:51 - about 2.5 million views per month
09:54 - and i have 500 000 subscribers so i'm
09:56 - going to assume that a channel that has
09:58 - 800 000 subscribers if they were doing
10:00 - something similar to me
10:01 - would probably get about 4 million views
10:04 - a month so let's put in 4 million
10:06 - looking at average video views the
10:08 - reason this is important is to
10:09 - estimate how much you would make from a
10:11 - sponsorship let's say
10:13 - if they have 4 million views a month
10:14 - they're averaging like 75 000 views of
10:17 - video
10:18 - that might be wrong could be lower or
10:19 - higher we'll mess with this number later
10:21 - on
10:21 - but anyways now let's look at monthly
10:24 - videos
10:25 - so how many videos do we think they post
10:26 - a month personally i post about 12
10:29 - videos a month
10:29 - sometimes 10 like usually over nine a
10:32 - month
10:33 - let's just say that they post less
10:34 - frequently and they post eight a month
10:37 - how many of those videos are going to be
10:39 - sponsored well
10:40 - you could say eight if all videos are
10:42 - sponsored we could also say something
10:44 - like four
10:44 - let's go conservative with that and now
10:46 - let's look at our rpm
10:48 - and sponsor rate all right so rpm stands
10:50 - for revenue
10:51 - per mile and this is pretty much telling
10:53 - you how much money you are making
10:56 - oh by the way all of this is in us
10:57 - dollars if i didn't state that
10:59 - per a thousand views on youtube so
11:01 - youtube obviously pays its content
11:03 - creators
11:03 - based on the amount of ads that run on
11:05 - their video and if they're in the
11:07 - partner program
11:08 - which means you have to have a thousand
11:09 - subscribers and at least i think it's
11:11 - like 12
11:12 - 000 watch time hours in the past year
11:14 - anyways
11:15 - revenue per mile is after this figure is
11:17 - after youtube takes its 45
11:20 - cut from your gross ad revenue so let's
11:22 - say i made 20 grand in ad revenue on
11:24 - youtube my gross ad revenue
11:26 - that's like what i made in total i would
11:29 - only keep about 11 000 of that because
11:31 - youtube takes
11:32 - 45 percent of all of the ad revenue so
11:35 - this rpm value is telling you how much
11:37 - you're actually going to get to keep
11:39 - pretty much it's after youtube takes its
11:40 - cut
11:41 - anyways the average rpm for a tech
11:43 - channel something in my sector i can't
11:45 - tell you what mine is
11:46 - but it's something close like 350 to 4.
11:49 - so i'll put 350 inside of there
11:51 - all right so moving on to sponsor rate
11:52 - this number here is how much you charge
11:55 - per 1000 views on a sponsored video
11:58 - now usually you negotiate this number
12:00 - beforehand and you actually will charge
12:02 - a flat rate for a sponsored video
12:04 - regardless of how many views it gets but
12:06 - you will take
12:07 - this average video views and multiply it
12:10 - by your sponsor rate
12:11 - then divide it by a thousand to figure
12:12 - out what the actual thing is going to be
12:14 - and well that will tell you how much you
12:16 - should charge for a sponsored video
12:18 - so you'll see how it works in one second
12:19 - but this number is highly dependent on
12:22 - what type of channel you are so if you
12:24 - are a general entertainment channel
12:26 - imagine you're like a gaming channel
12:27 - then your sponsorship rate is going to
12:29 - be a lot lower than something like my
12:31 - channel would be or something like
12:33 - makeup or beauty or cars anything that's
12:36 - more specific
12:37 - the reason for this is that the more
12:38 - specific or niche your channel
12:40 - is the easier it is to target as a
12:42 - marketer as an advertiser
12:44 - a specific customer right like if i'm
12:46 - advertising something tech on my channel
12:49 - chances are you know 95 percent of
12:51 - people that watch my video are into tech
12:53 - so i have to charge more for that
12:54 - because i'm actually having the
12:56 - advertiser
12:57 - target more people in tech than they
12:59 - would if they say got 75 000 views
13:02 - on some random entertainment channel
13:04 - hopefully that makes sense but the more
13:05 - niche the more specific your audience is
13:07 - which means the more you charge for
13:09 - sponsors
13:09 - because it's easier for an advertiser to
13:12 - target a specific customer
13:14 - hopefully that makes sense but anyways
13:15 - the average sponsorship rate
13:17 - again i can't tell you what mine is but
13:18 - for a tech channel would probably be
13:21 - between 40 and 50 dollars
13:23 - so this means you're charging about 50
13:25 - bucks for a thousand views
13:26 - and you can break that down you know per
13:28 - person watching the video and do the
13:29 - math and all of that but anyways i'm
13:30 - going to put
13:31 - 50 here so once i put all of this in
13:34 - we can go over and look at the youtube
13:36 - revenue and this will tell you
13:37 - approximately how much a channel with
13:39 - these figures or these statistics would
13:41 - actually make
13:42 - of course you can modify these
13:43 - statistics i'll leave the sheet down
13:44 - below to do that
13:46 - but in ad revenue this says are going to
13:47 - make about 14 000
13:49 - you can take your 4 million monthly
13:51 - views multiply that by your rpm so
13:53 - obviously you have to divide by a
13:54 - thousand then multiply by that number
13:56 - and what you get
13:57 - 14 000 you can see that's a calculation
13:59 - i'm doing right here
14:00 - so that gives you a monthly revenue of
14:01 - 14k us and a yearly revenue of 168 000
14:06 - then we look at sponsorships we say okay
14:08 - you're doing four sponsored videos per
14:09 - month you're averaging 75 000 views on
14:12 - those sponsored videos
14:13 - and you're charging 50 per estimated a
14:15 - thousand views
14:16 - so if they did that they would be
14:18 - charging i guess what's the math there
14:19 - about thirty five hundred dollars or
14:21 - yeah a little bit over thirty five
14:23 - hundred dollars per sponsored video
14:25 - uh which sounds pretty reasonable to me
14:27 - and that gives them about fifteen
14:29 - thousand dollars a month
14:30 - if they do four sponsored videos a month
14:31 - making up a hundred and eighty
14:33 - thousand dollars a year a lot of money
14:36 - next
14:36 - course sales so this is a number i just
14:38 - hard coded that they were gonna sell
14:39 - about a thousand dollars of courses a
14:41 - month
14:42 - now keep in mind a lot of people are
14:44 - selling way
14:45 - more than this right you might make this
14:47 - number something like 10
14:48 - 000 a month or maybe at 800 000
14:50 - subscribers
14:51 - something like 30 000 a month depending
14:54 - on how much your course is
14:55 - so i decided to go really conservative
14:57 - and just say that they're selling you
14:58 - know a thousand dollars worth of paid
15:00 - courses per month
15:01 - and that would give them 12 grand next
15:03 - merchandise
15:04 - i know personally for me i don't sell
15:06 - very much merchandise so i just put this
15:08 - at 500 bucks a month
15:09 - that would still give you six grand a
15:11 - year in merchandise sales
15:12 - again you can make that higher next
15:14 - affiliate sales now we'll leave this
15:16 - zero for right now because
15:17 - uh i don't really do affiliate links and
15:19 - well let's just assume this channel
15:20 - doesn't do it either
15:21 - and then i have this other section where
15:23 - you could just put in some other amount
15:24 - you're making per month
15:25 - maybe say something like donations you
15:27 - know 100 bucks a month right
15:28 - so there you go that gives you thirty
15:30 - thousand six hundred dollars a month in
15:32 - gross
15:33 - revenue and then that leads to three
15:35 - hundred and sixty seven thousand dollars
15:37 - a year
15:38 - so it's pretty easy when you look at
15:39 - this kind of breakdown and there's of
15:41 - course other revenue streams you could
15:42 - uh pursue as well
15:44 - to see how you would make a lot of money
15:46 - on youtube with a channel of a size of
15:48 - about eight hundred thousand
15:50 - now i would be willing to bet that most
15:51 - people that have a channel size of 800
15:53 - 000 if they know business well enough
15:55 - and they're like you know
15:56 - doing a lot of sponsors maybe more than
15:58 - four a month are making a lot more than
16:00 - 367 000
16:02 - a year but that is how much you can make
16:04 - with the channel like this assuming
16:05 - these kind of figures and all the
16:06 - assumptions that i've made of course you
16:08 - could also make a lot less
16:09 - really depends and this average views
16:11 - per video
16:12 - you can see really drastically will
16:14 - change how much you're going to generate
16:15 - based on the sponsorship
16:17 - value you're going to get or how much
16:18 - you're going to charge for a sponsorship
16:19 - okay so now i'll quickly run you through
16:21 - the expenses i don't want to spend too
16:22 - much time on this
16:23 - but pretty much we have expenses like
16:25 - editing or graphic design
16:26 - thumbnails video editing accounting fees
16:29 - if you're making this kind of money you
16:30 - probably
16:31 - pay an accountant to do your books for
16:33 - you you might not but either way i threw
16:34 - that in here just to give you an idea
16:36 - equipment yearly expense of about 15
16:38 - grand this is somewhat misleading
16:40 - because you wouldn't necessarily expense
16:42 - this entire amount because equipment is
16:44 - technically an asset to the business
16:46 - but anyways we'll just put that there
16:47 - for simplicity sake software
16:49 - subscriptions 200 bucks a month adobe
16:51 - creative cloud stuff like that
16:53 - website hosting straightforward phone
16:55 - canada we pay ridiculous phone bills so
16:57 - mine's like 100 bucks a month
16:59 - anyways that's the expenses let's move
17:01 - over to corporate net income and
17:02 - net income looking at corporate net
17:04 - income your yearly revenue is
17:07 - 367 000 your yearly expenses are 45 000
17:11 - that leaves you with a net income before
17:13 - taxes
17:14 - in your corporation assuming you're
17:16 - running the business as a corporation of
17:18 - three hundred and twenty one thousand
17:19 - dollars
17:20 - now in canada if we come down to net
17:22 - income after tax the corporate tax rate
17:24 - for anyone who makes
17:25 - less than eight hundred thousand dollars
17:26 - a year is twelve and a half percent
17:28 - i might be slightly wrong on that it
17:30 - might be half million dollars a year but
17:32 - either way the corporate tax rate for
17:33 - most small businesses
17:34 - is 12 and a half percent if they're like
17:36 - very small businesses
17:37 - so if we have a look at that you can see
17:39 - that you're going to pay about 40 000
17:41 - in corporate tax now for anyone that's
17:43 - confused here
17:44 - there's a lot of there's a big
17:46 - difference between how much you make in
17:48 - a company and how much you make
17:49 - personally right the company could
17:52 - generate a million dollars but you might
17:54 - only get paid from that company like
17:56 - 200 grand right you might have a ton of
17:58 - expenses
17:59 - that means that your company at the end
18:00 - of the year really only netted really
18:02 - only gained
18:03 - like 200 grand or whatever it may be so
18:05 - what i'm trying to show here is that the
18:07 - corporation is different from the
18:09 - individual
18:10 - so my corporation making money is
18:12 - different than me making money because i
18:14 - have to decide as the ceo of the
18:15 - corporation
18:16 - how much i'm going to pay myself at the
18:18 - end of the year i could pay myself the
18:20 - entire net income of the corporation
18:22 - or i could pay myself portions of that
18:25 - now this has to do with tax planning and
18:26 - a bunch of more advanced stuff but
18:28 - anyways the corporate tax rate is 12 and
18:29 - a half percent
18:30 - so if you have a look at this the
18:31 - corporate net income after tax is about
18:33 - 281 000
18:35 - so that would be in u.s dollars i don't
18:37 - know what the corporate tax rate is in
18:38 - u.s it's probably lower than it is in
18:40 - canada
18:40 - it's kind of weird because i'm using us
18:42 - dollars and canadian tax brackets but
18:44 - anyways you get the idea so corporate
18:46 - tax rate 12 and a half percent and then
18:47 - the personal tax rate in canada it's
18:49 - extremely high it's actually
18:51 - probably higher than this i put it at 41
18:53 - so if you have in your corporation 281
18:56 - thousand dollars and you decide to pay
18:58 - yourself all of that money from the
18:59 - corporation
19:00 - you're going to pay about 115 000 in tax
19:03 - at least in ontario where i live
19:04 - and that's going to bring you after tax
19:06 - to about 165
19:08 - 000 so i just included this here for
19:10 - anyone who cares to know kind of how the
19:12 - tax works
19:13 - uh and this is a reason since this
19:15 - personal tax rate is so high
19:16 - well you may not actually pay yourself
19:18 - the entire amount or the yeah
19:20 - i guess the entire net income that you
19:22 - have in the corporation you could
19:23 - theoretically pay yourself less
19:25 - you could say invest money in the
19:27 - corporation and then just over years
19:29 - slowly pay yourself more money out of
19:31 - the corporations that you keep your
19:32 - personal tax rate lower because
19:34 - obviously your tax rate is based on how
19:35 - much money you make per year
19:37 - so anyways that gives you an idea of how
19:39 - much a youtuber could generate with a
19:41 - channel size of eight hundred thousand
19:43 - and with that i am going to conclude
19:45 - this video so full disclosure i am not a
19:48 - business
19:48 - expert a lot of you probably will think
19:50 - that i'm just an absolute rookie when it
19:52 - comes to doing this kind of stuff
19:53 - and well i would probably agree with you
19:55 - this is simply the knowledge that i have
19:57 - i wanted to share with you guys and give
19:59 - you an idea of how much money
20:01 - youtubers are really making so to draw
20:03 - the conclusion here
20:05 - youtubers that are running large
20:06 - channels can definitely make
20:08 - much more than they would be if they
20:10 - were working as a software engineer
20:12 - especially considering the fact that
20:14 - youtube channels grow and get larger as
20:16 - time goes on
20:17 - so keep that in mind but i hope you
20:18 - found this video insightful and
20:20 - informative
20:21 - if you did please leave a like subscribe
20:23 - to the channel and i will see you in
20:24 - another youtube video
