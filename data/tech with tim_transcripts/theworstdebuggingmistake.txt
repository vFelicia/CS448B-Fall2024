00:00 - now I cannot tell you how many times I
00:03 - have spent hours trying to debug
00:05 - something just to realize I had a
00:07 - duplicate variable name I defined a
00:09 - variable here the variable was defined
00:11 - as the wrong type just check your
00:13 - variable names make sure everything's
00:15 - spelled correctly make sure the casing
00:16 - is proper make sure you don't have
00:18 - duplicate variables or maybe you're
00:19 - referencing a different value than you
00:21 - thought you were and so make sure you
00:23 - check through those and do that first
00:25 - because that is almost always going to
00:27 - be one of the root causes of your
00:28 - problem obviously if you can get that
00:29 - out of the way at the beginning that is
00:31 - going to save you a lot of time assuming
00:33 - that is what the problem is
