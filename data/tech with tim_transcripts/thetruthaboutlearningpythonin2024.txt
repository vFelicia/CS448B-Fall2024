00:00 - it's 2024 the tech industry is changing
00:03 - faster than ever we've got the rise of
00:05 - AI entry-level jobs getting more and
00:07 - more difficult to come by and a lot of
00:09 - you are asking the question should I be
00:11 - learning python or should I keep
00:13 - learning it if I already know it now
00:15 - given that this is a python Focus
00:16 - Channel I want to help answer that
00:18 - question today I want to break down who
00:20 - should learn python who shouldn't Learn
00:22 - Python and if you're not going to learn
00:23 - it what you should focus on to stay
00:25 - competitive in today's market so with
00:27 - that said let's get into the video and
00:29 - discuss the truth about learning python
00:31 - in 2024 so first things first I can make
00:34 - a lot of arguments for learning python
00:36 - and a lot for not learning python but
00:38 - pretty much all of these come down to
00:40 - your goal so before we go any further in
00:42 - the video pause and genuinely ask
00:44 - yourself why are you learning how to
00:46 - code why does python interest you in the
00:48 - first place what is your goal from
00:50 - learning a language like this or
00:51 - learning any language do you want to get
00:53 - a job is this just for a hobby are you
00:55 - doing it for fun are you doing it to
00:57 - improve your critical thinking skills
00:59 - doesn't matter the answer is but you
01:01 - need to know that before you can really
01:03 - determine if python is the right
01:04 - language for you now regardless of what
01:06 - language you're trying to learn it is
01:08 - important to keep up with the trends in

02:26 - industry so let's begin with a few
02:28 - important facts about the Python
02:30 - language and then I'll talk about who
02:31 - should learn it and who shouldn't and I
02:33 - think you might be surprised what my
02:35 - recommendations are now the first thing
02:37 - you need to know about python is that it
02:39 - is extremely popular and it has been for
02:41 - many many years and that's because it's
02:43 - very flexible it is a general purpose
02:46 - programming language and that means if
02:47 - you learn the language you can create a
02:49 - large variety of applications that
02:51 - doesn't mean python is the best for
02:53 - creating all different types of apps but
02:55 - having python under your belt really
02:57 - gives you a flexible language that lets
02:59 - you create a a lot of different things
03:01 - it's also very easy to learn it's
03:03 - beginner friendly and a lot of people
03:05 - will go to python as their first
03:06 - language because of those features it's
03:08 - not very intimidating and people can get
03:10 - a lot of confidence in the language
03:12 - pretty quickly which can propel them
03:14 - into other programming languages so with
03:16 - that in mind who should learn python
03:18 - well the first group of people I
03:20 - recommend Learn Python are those that
03:21 - are complete beginners that don't really
03:23 - know where to start if you're struggling
03:25 - picking a language or a framework you
03:27 - don't know the area you want to dive
03:29 - into then I'd recommend just starting
03:31 - with python because it's relatively
03:32 - simple there's tons of resources online
03:35 - it's very flexible and you can make a
03:37 - lot of things with it and you'll learn
03:38 - it pretty quickly compared to a lot of
03:40 - the other options this way you're not
03:42 - going to be wasting your time going
03:43 - through a ton of different options or
03:44 - learning a language that you may never
03:46 - use Python is always going to be usable
03:48 - to you and once you learn it it's really
03:50 - easy to switch over to another language
03:52 - now the next group of people that I
03:54 - recommend Learn Python are those that
03:56 - are interested in machine learning
03:57 - artificial intelligence data science or
03:59 - research heavy tasks almost all of those
04:02 - fields require Python and that's the
04:04 - primary language used in them and most
04:06 - of the popular Frameworks and libraries
04:08 - for those type of fields are written in
04:10 - Python so if you are interested in that
04:12 - then definitely just go and Learn Python
04:14 - you don't need to be a complete expert
04:16 - and a lot of the time is going to be
04:17 - spent learning the specific Frameworks
04:19 - and modules that will help you achieve
04:21 - the tasks that you're trying to complete
04:23 - for example you want to build a machine
04:24 - learning bot you want to interact with
04:26 - some different open- Source llms a lot
04:28 - of that's going to be much easier to do
04:30 - with python than different programming
04:32 - languages now one thing to note about
04:34 - python before we get too far is that
04:36 - while it is a general purpose language
04:37 - and you can build pretty much anything
04:39 - you can imagine with it it's not usually
04:41 - the best option for a specific task what
04:44 - I mean by that is while you can make a
04:46 - mobile app with python and you can make
04:48 - a website and you can make a game there
04:50 - are other languages or Frameworks that
04:52 - are better suited for building those
04:54 - specific applications for example you
04:56 - want to build a AAA game python is not
04:59 - going to be the language you go with
05:00 - you're going to want to choose something
05:01 - like C++ or C and utilize a framework
05:04 - maybe like Unity or something more
05:06 - complicated than that the point is that
05:08 - while python can do a lot of these
05:10 - things it's not the best for those tasks
05:13 - so if you know you want to be for
05:14 - example a mobile app developer then go
05:16 - and pick the best language for building
05:18 - mobile apps that might be Swift cotlin
05:21 - uh Java depending on what you're doing
05:23 - so just keep that in mind it is general
05:25 - purpose but again not usually the best
05:27 - for all of these really specific tasks
05:30 - now with that said something that python
05:31 - is really good at is Automation and
05:33 - scripting if you're someone who's more
05:35 - of a hobby programmer you want to build
05:37 - some scripts to automate your life or do
05:39 - some fun things on the side definitely
05:41 - choose python because it's so fast to
05:43 - build those types of applications maybe
05:45 - you want to work with raspberry pies you
05:47 - want to build a simple security system
05:49 - or you want to change the lights on your
05:50 - Christmas tree doing those type of
05:52 - things using python is really quick and
05:55 - it's really where the language shines
05:56 - also if you want to get into devops if
05:58 - you want to get into back in development
06:00 - python is well suited for those type of
06:02 - tasks so it is something I definitely
06:04 - recommend learning and even though you
06:06 - might need to know some other languages
06:08 - a lot of companies that are hiring for
06:09 - example a backend developer or someone
06:11 - doing some automation or scripting is
06:13 - going to assume that you know a little
06:15 - bit of python now another great Reason
06:17 - To Learn Python is if you're going to be
06:18 - doing coding interviews if you know
06:20 - you're going to be getting into that
06:22 - coding interview style question where
06:23 - you're doing leak code problems and all
06:25 - that kind of stuff on a whiteboard it's
06:27 - a lot easier to solve those types of
06:28 - problems in python just due to the
06:30 - nature of the syntax being really simple
06:33 - and the language being probably the
06:34 - closest to English out of most of the
06:36 - other programming languages makes it a
06:38 - lot easier for you to write and for your
06:40 - interviewer to understand and I find you
06:42 - can get things done a lot faster with
06:44 - the helpful methods and features that
06:46 - python has compared to various other
06:48 - languages it also just means that
06:50 - there's less syntax and complication
06:51 - that you have to deal with and I find
06:53 - you have some less error prone Solutions
06:55 - writing in something like python that
06:57 - you might have writing in say C+ Plus or
07:00 - Java or JavaScript just due to the
07:02 - nature of the syntax and again just how
07:04 - easy the code reads when you're actually
07:06 - writing things out so definitely
07:08 - something to consider now my last major
07:09 - argument for learning python is that
07:11 - it's just so fast to learn so if you are
07:13 - considering learning another language
07:15 - python is a great one to add to the list
07:17 - that you can get done in a fraction of
07:19 - the time compared to some more complex
07:21 - languages that we're going to talk about
07:22 - later with that said let's now talk
07:24 - about who shouldn't Learn Python and my
07:26 - Arguments for that now we're diving in
07:28 - and talking about why you may not want
07:30 - to Learn Python now the first reason on
07:33 - my list is that it just doesn't make you
07:35 - competitive there's a lot of other
07:36 - higher value languages and skills that
07:38 - you can learn that will make you stand
07:40 - out in the job market and the reason for
07:42 - that is pretty much everyone knows a
07:43 - little bit about python it's a very easy
07:46 - language a lot of people will use it for
07:48 - just a few weeks and then slap it on
07:49 - their resume almost everyone coming out
07:51 - of university has done a little bit of
07:53 - coding in Python and if that's the only
07:56 - language that you know you kind of just
07:57 - look like everyone else that has those
07:59 - same languages on their resume now only
08:01 - knowing python also just doesn't allow
08:03 - you to qualify for a lot of different
08:05 - jobs there are so many positions that
08:07 - require specialized knowledge in say
08:09 - JavaScript or Java or C++ or go or a
08:12 - wide variety of other languages and you
08:14 - can be a lot more competitive getting
08:16 - good in one of those than just having
08:18 - this more General Python language on
08:20 - your resume so if you are trying to get
08:22 - a job while python can help you a little
08:24 - bit I'd say that most of your time is
08:26 - better spent learning a different
08:28 - language where you can qualify for more
08:30 - specialized roles that have less
08:31 - competition again if everyone knows
08:33 - Python and everyone's applying for all
08:35 - those python entry-level developer
08:37 - positions it's going to be a lot easier
08:38 - for you if you get good at one specific
08:40 - language and you're competing against a
08:42 - smaller pool of people that have that
08:44 - qualification rather than everyone who
08:46 - knows python now another reason you may
08:49 - not want to learn python or you may want
08:50 - to switch to another language if you're
08:52 - already learning it is because it's a
08:54 - relatively simple language and it
08:56 - doesn't cover a lot of important
08:58 - programming features now now python is
09:00 - dynamically typed and it is
09:02 - objectoriented whereas a lot of other
09:03 - languages are statically typed and if
09:05 - you just know python you are missing a
09:07 - lot of fundamentals and important
09:09 - programming skills and that's actually
09:11 - why in things like my programming course
09:13 - with course careers we start by teaching
09:15 - you JavaScript we could have also taught
09:16 - python because they're similar in terms
09:18 - of the style of the language and then
09:20 - after that we immediately go into a
09:21 - statically typed language like go the
09:24 - reason for that is so that you cover all
09:25 - of those fundamentals that you miss from
09:27 - a language like python you learn learn
09:29 - about static typing you learn about
09:31 - concurrency you learn about pointers
09:33 - references Etc and you build a more
09:35 - solid base as a programmer to more
09:37 - easily transition into other languages
09:39 - so it's fine if you know python or you
09:41 - want to keep learning it but I'd
09:42 - recommend diversifying into at least one
09:44 - other language highly recommend that
09:46 - that is a statically typed language so
09:48 - you kind of cover the full spectrum of
09:50 - types of programming languages and you
09:52 - learn some of those more advanced
09:53 - features that you just don't need to
09:55 - know in a language like python now
09:57 - another reason you may not want to learn
09:59 - python and this is one of the reasons
10:00 - sometimes I dislike working with it is
10:02 - because it's not a very visual language
10:05 - what I mean by that is it's very
10:06 - difficult to build graphical user
10:08 - interfaces or visual applications with
10:11 - python a lot of times people find it
10:12 - easier or more enjoyable to write code
10:15 - when they can actually see a visual
10:16 - result of what it is that they're doing
10:18 - and that's why often times I do
10:20 - recommend learning JavaScript because
10:22 - compared to python it's a very visual
10:24 - language and you can very quickly
10:25 - actually see what it is that you're
10:27 - doing and what your code is producing
10:29 - whereas with python a lot of the times
10:30 - you're kind of stuck to the terminal
10:32 - you're stuck on the back end and while
10:33 - you can create uis and you can create
10:36 - kind of visual applications it's a lot
10:38 - more difficult there's more to learn and
10:40 - it's just not the best for doing those
10:42 - type of tasks so if you're someone who
10:43 - knows you want to be building visual
10:45 - applications user interfaces things you
10:47 - can actually see and interact with
10:49 - probably skip over Python and learn a
10:51 - different language maybe like JavaScript
10:54 - now lastly a reason you may not want to
10:55 - Learn Python is the slow execution Speed
10:58 - and Performance now this hasn't really
11:00 - been an issue for me in most of the
11:01 - applications that I build but if you are
11:03 - building something that is highly
11:04 - performant that needs to work on very
11:06 - specific Hardware where you need
11:08 - complete control of the language memory
11:10 - what's going on on a lower level
11:12 - definitely do not use Python because it
11:14 - is very bad at those specific tests and
11:16 - out of most of the modern programming
11:17 - languages it is one of the slowest so
11:20 - there we go that is why you should or
11:22 - shouldn't Learn Python and I'll quickly
11:24 - cover what you can do here if you're not
11:25 - learning python to stand out in today's
11:27 - market and be more competitive now what
11:30 - I would say is that if you want to land
11:32 - a job which I imagine is most of your
11:34 - goals if you've gotten this far in the
11:35 - video you really need to focus on
11:37 - looking at what employers actually want
11:39 - today now to do that you obviously can
11:41 - go through a curriculum maybe where
11:42 - they've curated it to those specific
11:44 - things for example I have a course with
11:46 - course careers but if you don't want to
11:48 - do that what I would recommend is go and
11:50 - look at a bunch of different job
11:51 - postings in areas that you're interested
11:53 - in for example if you want to get into
11:55 - front-end web development if you want to
11:57 - get into AAA game development whatever
11:59 - ever it is go look at companies that are
12:01 - hiring developers and read exactly what
12:03 - it is they want you to have a lot of
12:05 - people kind of go into this blind they
12:07 - just trust some random person like me
12:08 - online and watch one video and pick a
12:10 - language don't do that instead go read
12:13 - all of these different job postings see
12:15 - the type of job you would want to have
12:17 - and see exactly what they're listing as
12:19 - the requirements maybe python is there
12:21 - maybe Java is there maybe C++ is there
12:23 - maybe Frameworks or languages you've
12:24 - never heard of are there go and find
12:27 - what you want to do and then Focus
12:29 - learning for those specific positions
12:31 - don't just look at one look at 20 30 40
12:34 - 100 curate them and figure out what's
12:36 - popping up the most so that you're going
12:37 - to stand out and have the highest chance
12:39 - of qualifying for as many jobs as
12:41 - possible that's my recommendation that's
12:43 - exactly what I teach in my types of
12:45 - courses and that's how we've curated the
12:47 - curriculum for specifically entry-level
12:49 - developer positions regardless I hope
12:51 - you guys enjoyed the video if you did
