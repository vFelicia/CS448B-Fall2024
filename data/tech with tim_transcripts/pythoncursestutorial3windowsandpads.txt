00:00 - hello everybody and welcome to the third
00:02 - video in this python cursus tutorial
00:04 - series in this video i'm going to be
00:06 - talking to you about pads and windows
00:08 - now a window is something that we've
00:10 - already seen but what we can do is
00:11 - create our own windows that are smaller
00:13 - and a part of the main window and that
00:16 - allows us to control the text that's
00:17 - going in each individual window and
00:19 - refresh or clear each one based on what
00:22 - we want to do now a pad is something
00:24 - that allows us to show a certain amount
00:25 - of text on the screen at a time it's
00:27 - kind of hard to explain but i'll show
00:29 - you an example in one second
00:34 - [Music]
00:39 - alright so let's go ahead and get
00:41 - started now the first thing i'll show us
00:43 - how to do is how to create a new window
00:44 - and then we'll look at pat
00:46 - so i have the same code that i had in
00:48 - the previous tutorial i've just copied
00:49 - it in a new file and what we're going to
00:51 - do now is just create a new window
00:53 - so i'm actually going to take all of the
00:55 - stuff that i've added to the screen and
00:57 - instead i'm going to add it to a window
00:59 - and then that window will be a part of
01:01 - the screen so the window is stationary
01:03 - it stays on the screen it's not going to
01:05 - move off of the main screen and we can
01:07 - place stuff inside of the window so
01:09 - it'll be a little bit weird to
01:11 - understand this but we're going to place
01:12 - the window on the screen we'll call the
01:14 - screen just the terminal okay like the
01:16 - main screen that we have and then within
01:18 - the window it kind of has its own
01:20 - coordinates so if i want something to be
01:22 - at the top left of my window then i
01:24 - place that 0 0 in the window that
01:26 - doesn't mean it's going to be at 0 0 on
01:28 - the screen because the window could be
01:30 - placed further on the screen so let's
01:33 - just look at an example and this should
01:34 - hopefully clear it up what i'm going to
01:35 - do is just use the same example i had
01:37 - before except this time rather than
01:40 - adding my count to the
01:42 - screen i'm going to add it to my new
01:43 - window so i'm going to say counter
01:46 - underscore win is equal to and then this
01:48 - will be curses dot
01:50 - i'm going to use the new win function
01:52 - and then what i need to pass to this is
01:54 - the height the width and then the row
01:57 - and the column of where i want this
01:58 - window to be placed on my screen now you
02:00 - may have noticed by now it's kind of
02:02 - weird we're always passing the
02:03 - y-coordinate first and then the
02:04 - x-coordinate that's just the way it
02:06 - works for for curses so i'm going to say
02:09 - we want this to be maybe a height of 1
02:12 - so just one row high and then we'll have
02:14 - it be 20 characters long because we're
02:16 - only going to have to place count inside
02:17 - of here so i don't need it to be crazy
02:19 - big
02:20 - then we will place this at let's go 10
02:23 - 10. so it'll be 10 rows down and then 10
02:26 - columns to the right from the left hand
02:29 - side of the screen okay so that's our
02:31 - window it's going to be stationary on
02:32 - the screen it's not going to move and
02:34 - then what we're going to do is rather
02:36 - than adding here so rather than adding
02:38 - to the screen we're going to add to the
02:40 - window so i'm going to say counter win
02:42 - dot add string and then i will say
02:46 - counter win dot refresh as well now i
02:48 - still do need to clear this window and i
02:51 - do need to clear and refresh the main
02:53 - screen as well which i'll show you in a
02:54 - second so i'm going to say counter win
02:57 - dot clear so at the beginning of our for
02:59 - loop we're going to clear this if you're
03:01 - unsure about how this works i explained
03:02 - it in the previous tutorial anyways
03:04 - we'll clear the window then we'll
03:06 - calculate the color we'll then add the
03:07 - text the window and refresh the window
03:10 - and we should be good to go now i'm
03:12 - curious what's going to happen with our
03:14 - screen here because i'm not refreshing
03:15 - or updating the screen so let's just run
03:17 - it and then we can make any adjustments
03:19 - so i'm going to say python tutorial3.pi
03:22 - and notice we are getting this showing
03:23 - up completely fine and the window is
03:25 - down 10 rows and then 10 columns from
03:28 - the left obviously it's flashing because
03:30 - we are changing the color and then it
03:32 - goes away
03:33 - as soon as we finish the for loop okay
03:35 - so it looks like we didn't actually need
03:36 - to update or clear the screen to be able
03:38 - to see that that's good to know okay so
03:41 - now we have looked at a window let's
03:43 - just see what happens if we place some
03:45 - other text on the screen while we have a
03:47 - window
03:48 - so what i'm going to do is say
03:50 - let's go with std screen dot and then
03:54 - add string
03:55 - and let's just add the string
03:57 - hello world here exclamation point okay
04:00 - and then we'll refresh so that's the
04:01 - screen
04:03 - dot refresh
04:04 - like that so i just want to show you
04:06 - here that when i go and i do this this
04:08 - hello world text is going to stay
04:10 - persistently on the screen even though
04:13 - if i can kind of move over here we're
04:14 - clearing the window so what we're doing
04:16 - to the window is not affecting the
04:18 - screen and since i'm moving around the
04:19 - terminal that's why we're getting some
04:21 - weird output and of course now it's
04:22 - closed like all my stuff
04:25 - let's run this again but the point is
04:26 - that all of my operations on the window
04:29 - don't affect my screen and that's kind
04:30 - of the idea if i only want to refresh
04:32 - say one piece of text i just put it in a
04:34 - separate window and that way i don't
04:36 - have to constantly refresh and update
04:38 - the screen i just have to do it with the
04:40 - one window so that's going to be more
04:42 - efficient and that also means that i'm
04:43 - not going to potentially be messing up
04:45 - or removing any of the text that i want
04:46 - to persistently stay on the screen okay
04:50 - so that is windows pretty
04:51 - straightforward you can make as many
04:52 - windows as you want and again that's the
04:54 - point of them is that you can refresh
04:55 - them independently all right so now that
04:57 - we've talked about windows i'm going to
04:58 - talk about pads now a pad is kind of a
05:01 - special type of window that allows you
05:03 - to have content that's overflowing off
05:06 - of the screen now the reason you can
05:08 - have that is because with a pad you can
05:10 - show part of the pad on the screen now
05:13 - it's really really cool but you can
05:14 - actually kind of trim the pad and only
05:16 - show an aspect of it and then pick where
05:19 - on the screen you want it to go and you
05:20 - can move it around very very easily
05:23 - really hard to explain it's kind of an
05:25 - abstract thing it's not usually what you
05:26 - think of when you think of a pad so let
05:28 - me just show you an example and then you
05:30 - will understand so i'm going to delete
05:32 - all of this and i'm going to create a
05:33 - pad now to make a pad i'm going to say
05:35 - pad is equal to and then this is going
05:37 - to be curses dot new pad and what i need
05:40 - to pass is just the height and the width
05:42 - of this pad so i'm going to go 100 100
05:44 - and just make it nice and large now what
05:46 - i'm going to do is i'm going to fill
05:48 - this pad with a ton of content
05:50 - specifically just a bunch of characters
05:52 - so i'm going to say 4i
05:54 - in range and then this is going to be
05:55 - 100. i'm going to say 4j in range and
05:58 - then this will be 26. and the reason i'm
06:00 - doing 26 is i want to generate 26
06:04 - characters a hundred times so i want to
06:06 - essentially generate every single
06:08 - character in the alphabet a hundred
06:09 - times and add that into my path
06:12 - so what i'll do inside of here is say
06:14 - that my char is equal to
06:16 - and then this is going to be the char of
06:18 - and then 67 plus
06:20 - j
06:21 - now you might be confused on what this
06:22 - is doing but every single character on
06:25 - our keyboard has a unique number that
06:27 - represents it so for example uppercase a
06:30 - is represented by the number 67. now we
06:33 - have this function in python called char
06:34 - c-h-r that takes in some number and
06:37 - gives us the character that it
06:38 - represents so when j 0 we're going to
06:41 - get a
06:42 - when j is 1
06:43 - we are going to get b because it follows
06:46 - right after a we're going to have b
06:48 - that's one number higher then c then d
06:50 - so on and so forth so that's why i'm
06:52 - doing this 67 plus j
06:54 - so now that i have the character let me
06:55 - add it to the pad so i'm just going to
06:57 - say pad dot and this is going to be add
06:59 - string then i'm going to add the
07:01 - character and we could add it in a
07:03 - different color so let's go with green
07:06 - and black
07:08 - okay
07:08 - perfect now one thing i'm not sure that
07:10 - i mentioned before is that when you add
07:12 - stuff to a pad consecutively it's just
07:15 - going to add up where the cursor on the
07:17 - pad is so you've probably seen this in
07:19 - the terminal but you know you type your
07:20 - cursor moves with what you're typing and
07:22 - then whatever the cursor is is where
07:23 - you're going to be typing next so if i
07:25 - add this character my cursor is going to
07:27 - go to the end of the line where this
07:29 - character is or at the end of wherever
07:31 - the character so that means the next
07:32 - character comes after it i'm not writing
07:34 - this character on top of it for that to
07:37 - happen i would have to manually put 0 0
07:39 - here since i'm not putting that it
07:40 - doesn't mean i'm just placing it at 0 0
07:43 - it means that i'm placing it wherever
07:44 - the character currently is okay i wanted
07:46 - to go over that so now that this is in
07:48 - the pad what we can do is refresh the
07:51 - pad but the first thing i need to do is
07:52 - actually refresh the screen so i'm going
07:54 - to say screen dot
07:55 - and then let's just go with refresh
07:57 - because we're going to add the pad right
07:59 - and we're going to refresh the screen or
08:00 - this isn't on the screen yet but you'll
08:03 - see what i mean and then we say
08:04 - screen.refresh and then down here i'm
08:06 - going to refresh the pad so i'm going to
08:08 - say pad dot and then refresh
08:11 - now when i refresh the pad i actually
08:13 - need to pass six values to this and to
08:16 - explain what these values are i need to
08:17 - hop over to paint so i'm inside of paint
08:20 - you can see i have a lovely drawing here
08:22 - the black box is going to represent my
08:24 - screen and the green box is going to
08:26 - represent my pad now let's say that we
08:29 - only want to show this area of the pad
08:33 - on the screen
08:34 - well what i'm actually able to do here
08:36 - is when i refresh the pad i can choose
08:39 - how much of the pad i want to show and
08:41 - where i want it to be on the screen so
08:43 - the first thing that i can actually pass
08:45 - to my refresh is the coordinate of where
08:48 - i want to start showing my padded
08:50 - content
08:51 - relative to the pad so when i say
08:54 - relative to the pad that means we're
08:55 - going to treat 0 0 as the top left hand
08:58 - corner of the pad now let me actually
08:59 - draw a better example here so that i can
09:01 - show you so let's say we actually want
09:02 - to display maybe this
09:04 - okay so if i want to display this area
09:06 - of the pad then what i need to pass is
09:09 - this coordinate relative to here
09:12 - so it would probably be something like
09:14 - i don't know i'm with my mouse so i
09:15 - can't really draw it maybe like 2
09:17 - and 7 or something
09:19 - that would be the coordinate that i pass
09:20 - and the point of this is i'm saying i'm
09:22 - going to start displaying my padded
09:24 - content from here so all this stuff in
09:27 - this area i'm not going to display
09:29 - because i'm starting to show the padded
09:31 - content right here so everything to the
09:33 - right of that and down of that
09:34 - coordinate is the content i'm actually
09:36 - going to show so once i pick the content
09:38 - in the pad that i want to show then i
09:40 - need to decide how large i want the pad
09:42 - to be on my screen and where i want it
09:44 - to be located so what i can actually do
09:47 - is i can pick the top left hand corner
09:49 - of this padded content and the bottom
09:52 - right hand corner of this padded content
09:54 - that i want on the screen and i can cut
09:56 - off part of the content based on the
09:58 - coordinates that i pick so i would have
10:00 - to choose a coordinate relative to the
10:02 - screen for the top left hand corner of
10:04 - this
10:05 - and for the bottom right hand corner of
10:06 - this so now if my padded content is say
10:09 - let me just continue this red box
10:12 - everything in the red box so ignore the
10:14 - kind of dividing line but if that's the
10:15 - padded content what i can do is show i'm
10:18 - trying to find another color here like
10:20 - maybe only
10:21 - this amount of the padded content if i
10:23 - pick the bottom right hand corner and
10:25 - the top left hand corner to be certain
10:27 - values
10:28 - hopefully that makes a tiny bit of sense
10:29 - but i just have to pick how much padded
10:31 - content i want to show and then where i
10:33 - want to show it on the screen kind of
10:34 - the dimensions of the pad so now that
10:37 - that maybe clears it up let's look at
10:39 - what the arguments are going to be to
10:41 - pad dot refresh so i'm going to pass 0 0
10:44 - 5 5 and then 25.75
10:48 - now what this says is i want to start my
10:50 - padded content as 0 0. so pretty much
10:52 - all of the content i want to keep in my
10:54 - pad because i'm starting it right at 0
10:56 - 0. again relative to the pad then the
10:58 - top left hand corner of my padded
11:00 - content on the window i want to be five
11:03 - five so i'm going to start showing it at
11:05 - five five on the screen then i'm going
11:07 - to end all of it at
11:09 - 25.75 so i'm going to show it 25 rows
11:11 - down and 75 rows to the right
11:14 - let me just show you what this looks
11:16 - like so you get an idea and then we'll
11:17 - mess around with some values
11:19 - so notice that this is what we get so
11:21 - i'm starting to show it at five five i
11:23 - started the padded content at zero zero
11:25 - so we're not cut off on the left here
11:27 - and i'm going to
11:29 - 25.75 okay so we're 25 rows down 75 rows
11:32 - to the right
11:34 - now let's close this
11:36 - and let's look at what happens if i do
11:37 - 25 25
11:39 - okay so we change that let's run this
11:41 - and now notice we only go this far to
11:43 - the right we're showing 25 uh characters
11:46 - on the screen or sorry not 25 characters
11:48 - but we're going to column 25 and we're
11:50 - showing 25 rows
11:52 - let's hit this again
11:54 - let's change this to like 10 25
11:57 - and now let's look at this and notice we
11:59 - have a much smaller area
12:01 - great now i will change where the padded
12:04 - content starts so when i change this
12:06 - let's make this maybe 5 5 you're going
12:09 - to see that the content inside of the
12:10 - pad is going to look different so let's
12:12 - run this
12:13 - and notice now we don't start with c
12:15 - which is what we were starting with
12:16 - before we have different characters
12:18 - because we've started the padded content
12:19 - at a different area so to reiterate here
12:22 - we are passing the row where we want to
12:23 - start showing the padded content the
12:25 - column where we want to start showing
12:26 - the padded content and then we're
12:28 - passing the row and the column where we
12:30 - want to display this on the window and
12:33 - then the row in the column of the bottom
12:34 - right hand corner of where we want to
12:36 - display it so this is the top left hand
12:37 - corner this is the bottom right hand
12:38 - corner it kind of forms a rectangle and
12:41 - then we display whatever content this
12:43 - gives us in that area
12:45 - hopefully that is clear um yeah that is
12:47 - how the refresh works okay so now that
12:49 - we've done all of this i'm going to show
12:51 - you how we can actually scroll through
12:52 - our padded content which is going to
12:54 - look really cool so i'm going to do
12:55 - another for loop here i'm going to say
12:57 - 4i
12:58 - in range and let's just go with 50 and
13:00 - what i'm going to do is continually
13:02 - refresh the pad and i'm going to change
13:04 - where i'm showing the pad so i'm going
13:06 - to leave this at 0 but i'm going to put
13:09 - i here for the column of where i want to
13:11 - start showing my padded content i'm also
13:14 - going to say time dot sleep 0.2 just so
13:17 - that we have enough time to actually see
13:18 - this pad being refreshed so before i
13:21 - even really explain this let me just run
13:22 - this and show you so then the
13:24 - explanation makes more sense
13:26 - so look we're actually scrolling through
13:28 - this content we're continually kind of
13:29 - moving to the right and looking at more
13:31 - of it and it's staying stationary on the
13:33 - screen so this is one way that we can
13:35 - scroll through it another way that we
13:37 - can scroll through it is by actually
13:38 - moving the pad itself that wouldn't
13:41 - really scroll through it i guess but we
13:42 - can move the pad too so now rather than
13:44 - doing that so i had i in the column here
13:47 - so since i was incrementing i was
13:49 - changing how much of the pad i was
13:51 - showing now we're going to move i
13:54 - here so when i move i here this is going
13:56 - to change the top left-hand corner of
13:59 - where i'm displaying this but since i'm
14:00 - doing that i also need to add i to the
14:03 - bottom right hand corner so that we're
14:05 - going to be kind of moving a square
14:06 - across the screen not the square getting
14:08 - smaller i'll show you all of these
14:10 - examples but this is changing the column
14:12 - for the uh was it top left-hand corner
14:15 - and for the bottom right hand corner
14:17 - okay let's run this
14:19 - and now notice that it's scrolling on
14:21 - the screen but see that we're getting
14:23 - all of the previous pad like showing up
14:26 - on the screen still now the reason
14:28 - that's happening is because we're not
14:29 - clearing the screen after we move the
14:31 - pad so what i'm going to do now is i'm
14:34 - going to say
14:36 - std screen
14:37 - and then dot and this is going to be
14:39 - clear and then i'm going to refresh it
14:41 - because of course after we clear we need
14:43 - to refresh otherwise it's not actually
14:44 - going to do anything so now we're going
14:46 - to clear the screen refresh and then
14:48 - show the pad and then clear refresh and
14:50 - then show the pad so let's try this now
14:53 - and now you can see that we're actually
14:55 - kind of moving a rectangle across the
14:56 - screen that contains the content inside
14:58 - of it so this is pretty cool i mean this
15:00 - alone can allow you to make games
15:02 - because you can literally you know kind
15:04 - of move stuff around the screen in this
15:05 - fashion using these pads there's a few
15:08 - other ways to do it but this is probably
15:09 - the simplest way that i've seen
15:11 - now let's do it so that we're actually
15:13 - scrolling through the content while we
15:15 - move it to the right so the way i'll do
15:16 - that is i'll put i here as well
15:19 - so now i'm changing the amount of padded
15:20 - content i'm changing the location of the
15:22 - padded content and i guess that's all
15:24 - i'm doing okay so let's see this now
15:26 - notice that as i move it's kind of like
15:28 - i'm taking a window and moving it across
15:30 - my padded content because i'm getting
15:32 - different content inside of the pad it's
15:34 - not the same content
15:37 - awesome now let's see if we can move it
15:38 - diagonally as well so let's go like this
15:42 - let's go
15:43 - 5 plus i
15:45 - and 10 plus i and let's look at this on
15:48 - the screen now and it should go to the
15:50 - right and down so yeah we're moving it
15:51 - kind of diagonally and then we got an
15:53 - error now the reason we get an error
15:55 - here is because we tried to display this
15:57 - in an area that was invalid on the
15:59 - screen so what would have happened is i
16:01 - would have been too large for this
16:04 - coordinate right here so we would have
16:06 - kind of exceeded the row that we could
16:07 - show this out sorry it wouldn't be that
16:08 - coordinate it would be this coordinate
16:10 - right here so keep that in mind you can
16:12 - only display in a valid area of the
16:14 - screen and if you want to check the
16:15 - coordinates of the screen i have a kind
16:18 - of cheat right here that you can use you
16:20 - can use this
16:22 - curses.lines and then this is going to
16:24 - be minus one i don't know why it's
16:25 - showing all of these characters here and
16:27 - then curses.calls
16:29 - minus one so this is actually how you
16:30 - get the coordinates of the screen this
16:32 - tells you the number of rows or lines
16:34 - and the number of columns and to get
16:36 - kind of the maximum one you could place
16:37 - them at you just have to subtract one
16:39 - because we start counting at zero i'm
16:41 - not actually going to use these i just
16:42 - want to show you that's how you get the
16:43 - number of rows and columns kind of the
16:45 - screen dimensions
16:46 - okay so now that we've done that let's
16:48 - just look at one more example because
16:50 - it's pretty cool how we can scroll say
16:51 - vertically through this content as well
16:53 - so let's go back to kind of our original
16:55 - here
16:56 - so i had that at i let's make that 5.
16:59 - let's make that 10 let's make that 25.
17:02 - so let's say we want to actually scroll
17:04 - the other direction well if i want to
17:06 - scroll the other direction
17:07 - all i need to do here is actually make
17:09 - this i and i'll probably have to make
17:11 - this a bit less uh oh no our path has
17:13 - size 100 so that's fine if i do that
17:15 - okay anyways if i make this i now
17:18 - so just that first coordinate and now i
17:20 - run this uh wait scrolling in the
17:23 - direction
17:26 - okay that was a little bit weird what
17:28 - was happening there
17:30 - uh let me have a look at here because
17:31 - that that was not what i expected it
17:34 - to do
17:35 - so to me that kind of looked like we
17:37 - were scrolling
17:38 - horizontally when i wanted to just be
17:40 - scrolling vertically so this should in
17:43 - theory be scrolling vertically but it
17:44 - did look like it was going horizontally
17:46 - so let me just change a few coordinates
17:47 - here and see if we can make this a
17:48 - little bit easier to see
17:50 - so i'm just going to make this 0 0
17:52 - and we'll go with 20
17:54 - and then 20.
17:56 - now let's see how much different this
17:58 - looks this time because last time okay
18:00 - so there we go so now it looks like it's
18:02 - scrolling vertically and we're going to
18:03 - keep scrolling a bunch because we don't
18:05 - have the entire padded content filled
18:07 - right our pad is 100 by 100 we've only
18:09 - probably filled like 20 or 30 lines of
18:11 - it and so that's why uh it's like
18:14 - continually scrolling right now even
18:16 - though there's nothing on the screen
18:17 - it's still moving the pad upwards or
18:19 - moving the content in the pad upwards
18:21 - even though we have no more content left
18:23 - okay so let me get out of that
18:25 - all right so with that said that's
18:26 - pretty much everything that i needed to
18:28 - show you that was pads and windows
18:31 - pretty useful and pretty cool especially
18:33 - the pad because you can kind of scroll
18:34 - through it and move it around the screen
18:36 - definitely something you have to
18:37 - practice with i'm no pro as you can
18:39 - obviously see in this video but
18:41 - hopefully i at least showed you the
18:42 - syntax and gave you a few examples of
18:44 - kind of what's possible with it so
18:46 - anyways i am going to end the video here
18:48 - i hope you guys enjoyed if you did make
18:50 - sure they like subscribe the channel and
18:51 - i will see you in another one
18:55 - [Music]
