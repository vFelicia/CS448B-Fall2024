00:00 - all right so my next category here is
00:02 - mobile apps now this could be like a
00:05 - mobile web app so something that just
00:06 - runs in like Safari or runs on a browser
00:09 - in your phone but I'm more thinking of
00:11 - native mobile apps like a Android app or
00:14 - an IOS app obviously if you're applying
00:16 - as some kind of mobile developer then
00:18 - you're going to want to have this but
00:19 - even if you're applying for a regular
00:20 - Dev job I think it's cool to have a
00:23 - mobile app in your portfolio the reason
00:25 - I like these projects too is because if
00:27 - you can actually get this on say the
00:29 - Google Play Store if you're talking
00:30 - about the app store or iOS then it's
00:33 - really easy for someone to download and
00:35 - test out and this also shows someone
00:36 - that you've gone through the whole
00:37 - process of packaging an app signing an
00:40 - app bundling it deploying it getting
00:42 - everything into a production ready state
00:44 - so I think it's an interesting talking
00:45 - point in an interview it doesn't have to
00:47 - be super complicated as long as it's
00:49 - kind of well polished for it to stand
00:51 - out and be an impressive project to
00:53 - discuss and to look at on a resume
