00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - in this video i'll share with you every
00:10 - python project that i've ever made now
00:13 - that is a little bit of an exaggeration
00:15 - because i have made hundreds of python
00:17 - projects plenty of which are very boring
00:19 - and don't make a great video but in this
00:21 - video i will share with you every cool
00:23 - python project that i've ever made now
00:25 - with that said let me give you a taste
00:26 - of what you can expect here i have
00:28 - worked on all kinds of projects stuff
00:30 - like machine learning models websites
00:33 - simulations automation projects games ai
00:36 - that plays games all kinds of stuff and
00:38 - i'm sure this video will give you plenty
00:40 - of inspiration and ideas for projects
00:42 - that you can work on in python now if
00:45 - you're familiar with my videos then you
00:46 - know that almost every single one of
00:48 - these projects actually has a dedicated
00:50 - video tutorial i'll leave that in the
00:52 - description and mention that when i go
00:54 - through the project and almost all of
00:56 - those videos i have a sponsor just like
00:58 - this one this video is sponsored by
01:00 - intel and their one api tools and
01:03 - libraries one api is a cross
01:05 - architecture developer dream suite
01:07 - making it easy to port code between
01:08 - different platforms and even providing a
01:10 - certain level of future proofing it's
01:12 - good for developers working with ai
01:14 - internet of things cloud and more this
01:17 - makes one api a huge benefit to your
01:19 - toolkit and a massive time saver one api
01:22 - is also driving a new era of accelerated
01:24 - computing and lets developers like you
01:26 - create performant code quickly and
01:28 - correctly click the link in the
01:30 - description to zip right over to the
01:32 - full details and get started with one
01:34 - api today so let's dive in and start
01:36 - looking at these projects i'm gonna go
01:38 - extremely fast spending about 15 seconds
01:40 - on each project and the github links for
01:43 - all of these projects will be available
01:44 - in the description now if you want to
01:46 - gain the skill to work on some of these
01:48 - projects and get good at python then you
01:50 - should check out my course programming
01:52 - expert dot io i'll leave a link in the
01:54 - description but this is the best
01:55 - interactive course to learn how to code
01:57 - you can use discount code tim at
01:59 - checkout with that said let's go ahead
02:01 - and get into these projects so let's
02:03 - begin here with a fairly recent project
02:06 - now this is ai plays pong this is a
02:08 - program that uses neat otherwise known
02:10 - as neural evolution of augmented
02:12 - topologies to train an ai how to win at
02:15 - the game of pong
02:16 - next we have a planet simulation this is
02:19 - a program that simulates a few of the
02:20 - planets in our solar system orbiting
02:22 - around the sun this uses real physics
02:25 - and the laws of gravitational attraction
02:27 - continuing we have pictionary now this
02:29 - is a project that i made during a 12
02:31 - hour coding live stream it works
02:33 - similarly to scribble dot io and it lets
02:36 - people play pictionary online against
02:38 - other players next we have sudoku solver
02:40 - this is a project that not only lets you
02:42 - play the famous game of sudoku but also
02:44 - lets you click a single button to have
02:46 - the game solved for you if you're
02:48 - interested this uses an algorithm called
02:50 - backtracking continuing we have a
02:52 - sorting algorithm visualizer now i don't
02:55 - think i need to explain this one it's a
02:56 - fairly popular project in the software
02:58 - engineering space but it allows you to
03:00 - visualize super exciting sorting
03:02 - algorithms next we have snake the famous
03:05 - game of snake i'm sure many of you know
03:06 - it i made this in python using pie game
03:09 - and i do have an entire tutorial on this
03:11 - on my channel moving on we have an
03:13 - online chess game now this is another
03:15 - game that i made during a coding live
03:17 - stream this time it was actually an 18
03:19 - hour coding live stream yes i am pretty
03:21 - insane and this lets you play chess
03:23 - online fun fact everything in this
03:25 - program works except for checkmate
03:27 - continuing we now have a simpler project
03:30 - this is a words per minute typing test
03:32 - this is actually a very beginner
03:33 - friendly python project takes about 45
03:36 - minutes to code out and lets you test
03:38 - your words per minute in the terminal
03:40 - very fun project i'd recommend you give
03:42 - it a try continuing we now go on to our
03:45 - first web project or web development
03:47 - project now this is actually a blog that
03:49 - is implemented in flask so you can make
03:51 - a post you can view the post you can
03:53 - comment you can look at profiles
03:55 - everything you would expect you can do
03:56 - in a blog so next we have a game
03:59 - platformer game now this is an
04:00 - incomplete game i only built out kind of
04:02 - the beginning of it but i made this
04:04 - during another coding live stream this
04:06 - time it was a 10 hour coding live stream
04:08 - and the goal here was to enter this game
04:10 - into the replica game jam as you can see
04:12 - here i did not win the game gem
04:14 - continuing we have a game which is a car
04:17 - racing game in python now this
04:19 - implements acceleration braking and
04:21 - actually allows you to play against an
04:23 - ai that increases in speed as you
04:25 - complete the level
04:27 - moving on we have a security camera in
04:29 - python now this is activated by motion
04:31 - and actually records videos to your
04:34 - computer so if you have a raspberry pi
04:36 - or some type of webcam and you want to
04:37 - run this program then you can have a
04:39 - security camera in python next we have
04:42 - an ai that plays checkers this is pretty
04:44 - straightforward i first built out the
04:45 - game of checkers in pygame and then i
04:47 - implemented the mini max algorithm to
04:50 - have a form of ai that can play against
04:52 - you in this game
04:53 - continuing we now move on to our first
04:55 - machine learning project now i made this
04:57 - one about three years ago and this is a
04:59 - machine learning model that can
05:00 - successfully guess the number you draw
05:02 - on a screen so pretty cool this uses the
05:04 - mnist digit data set and is kind of a
05:07 - default or sample project from
05:09 - tensorflow continuing we have my version
05:12 - of microsoft paint so it's a simple
05:14 - program that lets you draw a picture
05:16 - save it load it and do all the other
05:18 - stuff that you would assume you can do
05:20 - in a paint program
05:22 - next we have a simple script that
05:24 - creates some fractal art in python using
05:26 - recursion i actually built something
05:28 - like this in one of my computer science
05:29 - classes and figured it'd be a cool idea
05:31 - to show it here on the channel
05:33 - continuing we have a turtle racing game
05:35 - that i made using the turtle module in
05:37 - python i actually made this because i
05:39 - was teaching kids how to code at a
05:40 - summer camp and i wanted to build
05:42 - something out that was going to be
05:43 - entertaining and show them kind of how
05:45 - you create a larger program that uses
05:48 - random numbers and move stuff on the
05:50 - screen anyways this was solely meant to
05:52 - entertain a classroom full of children
05:54 - continuing we now have another famous
05:57 - game this time it is tetris not much to
05:59 - say here built this out in pi game
06:01 - there's also a tutorial for this on my
06:03 - channel moving on we have another
06:05 - algorithm visualizer project this time
06:07 - it is the a star pathfinding algorithm i
06:10 - visualized this in kind of a grid system
06:12 - in python and well you can see it is
06:14 - actually pretty cool
06:16 - next we have my version of a guard dot
06:18 - io now this was the famous game that
06:20 - everyone in my high school at least was
06:22 - always playing and i built this project
06:24 - out again when i was working at that
06:26 - summer camp and allowed all of the kids
06:28 - that i was teaching how to code to play
06:29 - this game if they got their coding work
06:32 - done fast enough now we'll move on to
06:34 - another live stream coding project this
06:36 - one was a tower defense game highly
06:38 - inspired from balloons tower defense i
06:41 - made this in 12 hours live and you guys
06:43 - seem to really enjoy it next we have
06:45 - another ai project this one is ai place
06:48 - flappy bird this is probably one of my
06:50 - favorite projects of all time and is
06:52 - actually very interesting to watch learn
06:54 - again this uses neat narrow evolution of
06:56 - augmented topologies to train an ai how
06:59 - to navigate through the pipes in flappy
07:01 - bird this next project i'm going to show
07:03 - you i actually made as my final project
07:05 - for my grade 11 computer science class
07:07 - and this is highly inspired from an app
07:09 - i used to use all the time called super
07:11 - stickman golf so this is my version of
07:13 - that it's just mini golf in python he
07:16 - uses real physics projectile motion and
07:18 - something back then i was very proud of
07:20 - making in hiking
07:22 - next we have a card game actually i
07:23 - think the only one on this list this is
07:25 - blackjack now the two times i have
07:27 - played blackjack in the past i lost 500
07:30 - but i still thought it would be fun to
07:31 - make this game in python so here we go
07:33 - this is blackjack moving on here we have
07:35 - more of an automation project now i made
07:38 - this when i was working at the summer
07:39 - camp as well and what this does is
07:41 - automate the creation of schedules for
07:43 - groups of campers so it takes in some
07:45 - inputs and spits out a word document
07:47 - with the generated schedules for the
07:49 - next week of camp and for the second
07:51 - last project on my list here i have
07:53 - hangman a very simple one i made this as
07:55 - one of my first pie game projects in
07:58 - grade 11. finally we move on to my very
08:01 - last project which is a real-time
08:03 - messaging app in python now i also made
08:05 - this during a live stream it was
08:07 - actually what i submitted to shopify as
08:08 - my coding project during my interviews
08:11 - fun fact i did get the job at shopify
08:13 - but ended up turning it down for an
08:14 - internship at microsoft so now that we
08:17 - have gone through those 27 projects i am
08:19 - officially out of breath and ready to
08:21 - conclude this video i hope you guys
08:23 - enjoyed i hope this gave you some
08:25 - motivation and inspiration for projects
08:27 - you can work on and again as a reminder
08:30 - all of the links and resources for these
08:32 - projects will be available in the
08:33 - description if you're interested check
08:35 - out my course programming expert dot io
08:37 - if you enjoyed the video leave a like
08:39 - subscribe to the channel and i will see
08:41 - you in another one
