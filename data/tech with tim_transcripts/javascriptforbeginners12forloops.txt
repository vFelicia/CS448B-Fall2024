00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back to
00:01 - their JavaScript tutorial so in this
00:03 - video we are gonna be talking about four
00:05 - loops now four loops are the most common
00:07 - type of loops I would say almost one of
00:09 - the most common types of expressions
00:10 - that you will see in code they're
00:12 - responsible for millions upon millions
00:14 - of different tasks they are fundamental
00:17 - so you really need to make sure you
00:18 - understand the before moving forward
00:19 - into some more complex topics in the
00:21 - language so what is a for well a for
00:25 - loop is used when you want to loop a
00:26 - defined amount of times or you know how
00:29 - many times you want to loop so in the
00:31 - previous video we talked about while
00:32 - loops where we looped based on a
00:34 - condition
00:34 - now that condition could change at any
00:37 - point in time it the user could change
00:39 - and it can change from different areas
00:40 - of the code and essentially we don't
00:42 - know how many times were looping with
00:44 - that condition because it's just what
00:45 - that condition is true or whether it's
00:47 - false whereas here in our for loop we
00:50 - actually usually know exactly how many
00:52 - times we're gonna be going through the
00:54 - loop and I'm gonna talk about that now
00:56 - and show you how this works so the basic
00:58 - syntax for a for loop is for you're
01:02 - gonna define a variable in here I'm just
01:03 - gonna type it out and we'll talk about
01:05 - it later we're gonna put a condition
01:06 - here and we're gonna put an increment
01:08 - step here now I just want to show you
01:10 - guys how this works and then I'll
01:11 - explain the entire thing so just maybe
01:13 - you cannot use some intuition and get an
01:15 - idea of what I'm doing here but I'm just
01:17 - a for loop I've set var I equals 0 I is
01:19 - less than 10 I plus plus console dot log
01:22 - I I know this is confusing but let's
01:24 - have a look at this here well we get 0
01:26 - through 9 prints to edge of the screen
01:28 - ok so what the heck did I do in how does
01:30 - this work well the first step of a for
01:33 - loop is to define a variable in this
01:35 - case I'm gonna call it I you can call
01:37 - whatever you want and set it equal to an
01:39 - initial value this initial value is
01:42 - gonna be the value that you start
01:43 - looping at next we type a condition now
01:48 - this condition is the condition that
01:49 - will be used to run the for loop it must
01:52 - involve the variable here that you use
01:54 - so I have to use I here and then we have
01:58 - an increment so I plus plus and this
02:00 - tells me how much to add to I every time
02:02 - one of these loops successfully
02:04 - completes inside of these curly braces
02:06 - it's what's gonna happen whenever we
02:08 - loop we could of course do multiple
02:10 - things in here like console dot log
02:13 - Tim right and then if we go here and we
02:15 - refresh we can get Tim every other time
02:17 - after all these words but that is the
02:19 - basics to how this works now what I can
02:22 - do is manipulate these numbers so that I
02:25 - can loop a different amount of times or
02:27 - through different numbers so for example
02:30 - rather than adding 1 each time I could
02:32 - add 2 so this is how much you're adding
02:35 - to I every loop and now watch what
02:36 - happens when I have my numbers I go from
02:38 - 0 to 8 but not to 10 because obviously I
02:41 - was less than 10 I could start at a
02:44 - different value I could start at value 5
02:46 - so now we will get 5 7 9 4 anything out
02:49 - because we want 5 and then we added 2
02:50 - each time and that is how a for loop
02:53 - works so you just start at some value
02:56 - you're less than some value and then you
02:58 - have I plus equals you know what I'm now
03:01 - in here we can do all kinds of different
03:04 - things I can also break out of this loop
03:06 - if I want so I can say something like if
03:07 - I'm equals equals 7 I could break and
03:12 - now what we'll get is all right we
03:15 - should get at least is just 5 7 printing
03:18 - out and we do because we broke one I
03:19 - equals 7 and this break keyword works
03:22 - the same as it does for a while loop it
03:24 - simply breaks out of whatever closest
03:26 - loop we find which is this for loop and
03:28 - yeah so now what I'm going to do is show
03:30 - you as an example of how we can loop
03:32 - through an array in here and actually
03:35 - see if a specific value exists in the
03:37 - array so what I'm actually going to do
03:39 - is I'm going to create a function what I
03:41 - want this function to do is to look in
03:44 - an array for a certain value and return
03:46 - whether we found that value or not so
03:48 - this will be a little bit of review from
03:49 - functions in case we forgot about those
03:52 - before so I'm gonna say function find in
03:55 - alright like this I'm gonna say ARR
03:58 - which stands for my array and I'm gonna
03:59 - stay value which stands for what we're
04:02 - looking for now what I'm gonna do is
04:04 - write some piece of code it's gonna look
04:06 - through the array and tell me if a value
04:09 - exists in it so what I'm gonna do is
04:12 - make use a for loop actually and you
04:14 - guys will see how this works here I'm
04:15 - gonna say for int I equals 0 or sorry
04:19 - not into I I'm coding in Java right now
04:21 - say var I equals 0 we'll say I is less
04:24 - than AR r dot length and
04:26 - ARR is gonna be in a rack and then we'll
04:28 - say I plus plus now what I'm gonna do in
04:31 - here is I'm going to say if ARR I equals
04:35 - equals value return true like that okay
04:42 - if I get spelled true correctly now at
04:45 - the end of this loop I'm gonna return
04:46 - false and we're gonna run through how
04:48 - this works okay so what have I done here
04:51 - well I've essentially created for loop
04:53 - that's gonna look through every element
04:55 - in the array that I pass in because it's
04:57 - gonna go from zero to whatever the
04:59 - length of the array is and we're gonna
05:00 - check some value every time inside of
05:02 - this loop so what I'm gonna do is say if
05:04 - the value at array whatever index I'm at
05:08 - is equal to the value we're looking for
05:10 - return true because that means we found
05:12 - the value so we can simply return true
05:14 - and by doing this that will
05:15 - automatically break out of this for loop
05:17 - so we won't continue to loop anymore
05:19 - we'll just return to wherever we were
05:20 - called from now let's say we loop
05:23 - through all the elements in the array
05:24 - and we don't find the element well we'll
05:26 - step out of that loop we'll start moving
05:28 - down will read this return false and
05:31 - then we'll simply return false because
05:32 - that means we did not find the element
05:34 - we were looking for so let's actually
05:36 - call this function and see if this works
05:38 - so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say
05:39 - bar arr equals and in this case we'll
05:42 - say one two five six seven maybe we'll
05:45 - throw a Tim in there we could throw a
05:48 - true why not now what I'm gonna do is
05:52 - simply say console dot log and we'll do
05:55 - the name of the function here so find an
05:57 - array and then what I'm gonna do is pass
05:59 - the array and what is the value that I
06:01 - want to look for it well actually let's
06:03 - look if five exists in the array so the
06:05 - output here should be a true or it
06:07 - should be a false and let's have a look
06:09 - at our console here we refresh we get
06:11 - true as we did find five in your rank
06:13 - now what if I do
06:14 - Tim three is that in the array well
06:18 - let's look here no we get the value
06:20 - false so that's just a very basic
06:22 - example of what you can do with a for
06:24 - loop it's very powerful you can do lots
06:27 - of different things now I will show you
06:29 - some embedded for loops and I'm gonna
06:31 - talk about four of either in this video
06:33 - or the next one but let's leave that
06:35 - function up here for now and what I want
06:37 - to do is I actually want to make a nut
06:40 - function and I'm gonna call it um mmm
06:43 - N squared let's like this okay
06:46 - and swing now in here what I'm gonna do
06:49 - is take some value and and what I want
06:51 - this function to do is print out the
06:54 - value n but squared so whatever n is I
06:57 - want to print out that like amount of x
06:59 - squared now I know this is confusing but
07:02 - you guys will understand what I mean in
07:03 - a second so what I'm going to do is I'm
07:04 - going to set up a for loop and inside
07:06 - here I'm actually gonna say var I equals
07:10 - 0 I is less than and in this case N and
07:14 - then we'll say I plus plus now what I'm
07:17 - gonna do in here is make another loop
07:18 - and I'm going to say for VAR j equals 0
07:23 - and i'm gonna say in this case we'll say
07:26 - J is less than and and then J plus plus
07:29 - and then what I'm gonna do in here is
07:31 - say console dot log and will simply
07:35 - print I don't know it'll just print run
07:37 - okay so what I wanted this to do was
07:41 - simply have something printing out to
07:43 - the screen N squared amount of times now
07:46 - how do we do that so this is n we want
07:49 - to print some value N squared amount of
07:51 - times well what I could have done is the
07:52 - exponent so I could have done and and
07:54 - then to the exponent 2 which I think I
07:56 - showed in previous videos how to do but
07:58 - I want to explain why this will actually
08:00 - print the value run N squared amount of
08:03 - times and for those of you that are
08:04 - unfamiliar N squared is simply n times n
08:08 - right so it's n times n 2 times which is
08:10 - that okay so how does this work well we
08:13 - have this first for loop that runs from
08:15 - I equals 0 to n which means it's gonna
08:17 - run actually n times I know people like
08:19 - well why do you have it less than n well
08:21 - because since we start at 0 we go up to
08:23 - end but don't include N so that will
08:25 - actually be an amount of times that we
08:27 - will loop and then inside of this for
08:30 - loop we have another for loop that
08:32 - starts J equals 0 and goes J less than n
08:35 - which means this is gonna run end times
08:37 - so if this is running n times and this
08:41 - is running n times and this runs every
08:44 - time one of these runs well this
08:46 - actually gives us the value of N squared
08:48 - because what's going to happen is this
08:51 - is going to be on loop 0 this is
08:53 - gonna run already end times right then
08:55 - this is gonna be on and what is it I
08:58 - equals one so now we're gonna have n
09:00 - plus N and then plus N and then plus N
09:03 - and we're gonna keep doing that n times
09:05 - right and that's how many times this is
09:07 - gonna loop and if you're confused by
09:09 - this just ignore it it's not that big of
09:10 - a deal but I just want to show you guys
09:11 - some different things that we could use
09:13 - so now what I'm gonna do is N squared
09:15 - I'm just gonna put 5 in there now you
09:17 - should know that that value is 25 so 5
09:20 - times 5 let's refresh this you can see
09:22 - that it printed 25 or run 25 times now
09:26 - if I put a value like 3 in here
09:28 - obviously we should get 9 and you can
09:30 - see we're getting 9 there so these are
09:32 - my kind of two examples with 4 loops I'm
09:35 - actually gonna stick the or stay with
09:37 - the 4 of loops for the next video so
09:39 - we'll talk about those there but
09:41 - hopefully this gives you an idea how you
09:42 - can use for loops again you have a
09:45 - variable you can start it wherever you
09:46 - want you have a condition this is what
09:48 - you're gonna loop until and then you
09:50 - have an increment so what you're adding
09:51 - to this counter variable here you can
09:54 - obviously put four loops inside of 4
09:56 - loops if you want to that's what we've
09:57 - done here and you know a really great
09:59 - way to loop through elements is to use a
10:00 - for loop and if you want to check if
10:02 - something exists then you could do
10:03 - something like this check it against a
10:05 - value and you know put it in a function
10:06 - and return true all of that fun stuff so
10:08 - maybe that has been it if you guys
10:09 - enjoyed it make sure you leave a like

10:12 - you guys in the next JavaScript tutorial
