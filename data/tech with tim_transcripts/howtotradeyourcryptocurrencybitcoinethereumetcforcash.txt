00:06 - hey guys welcome back to another youtube
00:09 - video in today's video i'm gonna be
00:11 - showing you how you can trade your coins
00:13 - so aetherium bitcoin litecoin neo all
00:16 - those different coins for fiat currency
00:19 - and if you don't know fiat currency is
00:21 - just canadian dollars a US dollars
00:23 - things that you can actually use right
00:24 - now in the real world so on my last
00:27 - video i did how to mine aetherium or
00:29 - that was a few videos back and someone
00:31 - asked the question well I have all this
00:33 - aetherium so how can I actually get it
00:35 - into real currency that I can spend so
00:37 - that was really good questions so that's
00:39 - why I'm doing a video here if you guys
00:40 - have any questions just leave a comment
00:42 - down below and I'll be sure to make a
00:43 - video about that alright so what we need
00:47 - to do if we're gonna trade our coins is
00:49 - we need to go on something called an
00:50 - exchange now there's a bunch of
00:51 - different exchanges this one that I'm
00:53 - showing right now works for Canadian and
00:55 - US dollars so that's why I'm gonna be
00:57 - doing this one right now as I live in
00:59 - Canada so I want to show how you can get
01:01 - Canadian dollars because a lot of them
01:02 - are just US dollar exchanges alright so
01:05 - this is called quadric ax CX at the top
01:07 - I'll put the link in the description so
01:09 - go over here and make an account and
01:11 - from there then we can trade our coins
01:15 - so say for example you want to trade
01:17 - aetherium so this this exchange only
01:20 - trades Bitcoin aetherium and litecoin
01:22 - the other one that I'm gonna show later
01:23 - will do all different kinds of coins but
01:25 - it's a little more complicated to get
01:26 - your money so just listen for this one
01:29 - first so if you have F what you're gonna
01:32 - want to do is you're gonna want to send
01:34 - all your F to a wallet on this exchange
01:36 - so you can click fund account on under F
01:38 - and then it'll give you a wallet address
01:40 - right here so from your theory and
01:42 - wallet wherever it might be you're gonna
01:44 - put all your theorem or whatever amount
01:45 - you want to send and you're gonna send
01:47 - it to this address now once you send it
01:49 - you should see under here it says
01:51 - pending it'll say like pending 0.5
01:54 - aetherium it would however much you're
01:55 - sending and then after a few minutes
01:57 - once the transaction has been confirmed
01:59 - you'll see your balance up here so once
02:02 - you have a balance it's really simple
02:04 - all you have to do is go ahead and click
02:05 - on trade and then once you hit on trade
02:08 - you can select your option on top right
02:09 - here so in this case we're gonna want to
02:11 - trade aetherium for can
02:13 - dollars which I already have selected if
02:15 - you want to do it for US dollars then
02:17 - you would have had to set up a u.s.
02:18 - account when you did it and then you
02:19 - could trade for US dollars so you're
02:21 - gonna put in your f so say you have 0.5
02:24 - F you would type 0.5 it'll tell you how
02:26 - much it's worth in Canadian dollars and
02:28 - then you go ahead and you click sell now
02:30 - obviously I don't have any right now so
02:31 - it's not gonna work now once you do that
02:33 - you should see your canadian dollar
02:35 - balance will now be equal to well in
02:37 - this case it was two hundred thirteen
02:38 - dollars so once you do once you see that
02:41 - balance you can go ahead and click
02:43 - withdraw now you're gonna have to set up
02:45 - a bank account here so especially the
02:48 - way that I like to do it is just go
02:49 - direct deposit into your bank account so
02:51 - you just have to find your transit
02:52 - number your branch or institution if
02:55 - you're in Canada and then the account
02:58 - number so you can either do cash
03:00 - delivery all these other different
03:01 - options it doesn't really matter which
03:03 - one you do I usually just go for the
03:05 - direct bank transfer I've done it five
03:07 - times so far on this website and
03:08 - everything's gone fine it's taken less
03:10 - than six days usually so you can be sure
03:13 - that that's gonna work for you now there
03:15 - is a minimum amount all of these accept
03:18 - the voucher which I wouldn't bother
03:19 - using which is $50 so just make sure if
03:22 - you're trading you're gonna have at
03:23 - least $50 worth otherwise you're just
03:24 - gonna have to wait until you get that
03:26 - amount before you can send it to your
03:27 - bank account so then you would go ahead
03:29 - and you would click select and then you
03:31 - have to type in your information so in
03:34 - this case you type in your bank whatever
03:37 - one it might be and then the address
03:39 - account number and so on and then your
03:41 - transaction pin which you will set up
03:43 - when you create an account on this
03:44 - website so go ahead and then hit submit
03:47 - it should send you an email saying that
03:49 - things are gonna be going through and so
03:51 - on and then you can check your bank
03:53 - account every few days just to see if
03:55 - it's come in so that's the first way
03:57 - that you can trade your coins for actual
04:00 - money and this is the way that I do it
04:01 - just on quadric ocx because it's one of
04:04 - the only Canadian exchanges
04:05 - alright so now I'm gonna show you say
04:08 - you have a different coin you don't have
04:10 - Bitcoin you don't have a theorem you
04:11 - don't have like coin you have something
04:12 - else now this is where it gets a little
04:14 - complicated especially if you're in
04:16 - Canada so for example here I have 26 nav
04:20 - corn this is the exchange bit tricks
04:22 - which is a different exchange it has all
04:23 - the different alt coins on it and it's
04:26 - really
04:26 - to buy a bunch of different coins here
04:27 - because you can use Bitcoin as well
04:29 - you're gonna go ahead and just go to
04:31 - Bitcoin markets and then what you're
04:34 - gonna want to do
04:35 - sorry not Bitcoin markets you're gonna
04:36 - want to type in the name of your
04:38 - currency that you have so for example if
04:40 - we have neo which I have right here you
04:43 - type in neo in the search bar up here
04:45 - neo would come up and then you click on
04:48 - the little plus icon so this is just
04:50 - under the wallet stop by the way the
04:51 - Bitcoin wallets up here you're gonna
04:54 - click on the plus icon and then it
04:57 - should pop up a thing loading up your
04:59 - address so just wait for that to load up
05:02 - and then that's gonna load up your neo
05:04 - address so once that is loaded up then
05:08 - you can just copy that address so mine
05:10 - hasn't loaded up yet I don't know what's
05:11 - going on right now but just pretend it's
05:12 - there you're gonna copy that address and
05:14 - then again you're gonna send all your
05:15 - neo to that address from your wallet now
05:18 - once you're here you can either set up
05:21 - for dollar accounts like this if you
05:24 - want to so you can set up like a bank
05:26 - account on the website usually what I do
05:29 - just because I'm pretty sure I haven't
05:30 - tried though that this is only for
05:31 - American dollars or Chinese dollars is I
05:34 - just trade it for Bitcoin so if I just
05:36 - go to the Bitcoin markets and I go neo
05:38 - and then I would just go to sell here I
05:41 - would type in the max and then price
05:45 - usually you just do the bid or the last
05:47 - price and then you hit sell and then
05:50 - what would happen there is then you can
05:52 - uncheck your Bitcoin wallet so here you
05:55 - go
05:55 - BTC is that's the tag for Bitcoin oops
06:00 - not NVC BTC and then it should show up
06:04 - in your wallet right here where you can
06:06 - then click the minus sign minus sign
06:09 - again and then you can click withdraw
06:12 - and send it to the address of this
06:14 - quadrakill
06:15 - thing here so you click fund account it
06:18 - would give you the address here you
06:20 - would copy this address paste it into
06:22 - this bar right here and then you could
06:25 - send it over to quadriga
06:27 - where you could then trade it the way I
06:28 - showed you before for u.s. or Canadian
06:31 - dollars so yeah I know I went a little
06:33 - bit fast but pretty much that's the way
06:35 - that you can actually trade your coins
06:36 - for real money they do not make it
06:38 - extremely easy to
06:39 - so you have to go on exchanges to do it
06:42 - so like I showed you can use either Quad
06:45 - Rica here or you can use bit tricks on
06:48 - bit tricks here
06:49 - I'm pretty sure you can also go to a
06:51 - bank account but I haven't tried it so
06:53 - usually I just trade it for Bitcoin and
06:54 - then send my Bitcoin here where I can
06:56 - then trade it for Canadian dollars now
06:59 - there is a thing to keep in mind here
07:00 - you're gonna have to pay fees when
07:03 - you're sending all of these things so
07:04 - when you're sending your knee or your
07:06 - theorem you are gonna pay small fees so
07:08 - if you're gonna be doing this a lot of
07:10 - times maybe just wait until you have a
07:12 - large amount and sell that one so you're
07:14 - not getting you're not paying all those
07:16 - fees because they do add up to a little
07:18 - bit of money so yeah yeah so that's been
07:20 - the video for today if you liked please
07:23 - leave a like and subscribe and I will
07:24 - see you again in another
