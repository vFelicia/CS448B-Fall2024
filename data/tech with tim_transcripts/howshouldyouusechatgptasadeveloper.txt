00:00 - so first let me share with you how I use
00:02 - Chad gbt now I will admit this is not a
00:04 - massive part of my workflow a lot of
00:06 - what I'm doing as more of a senior
00:08 - programmer right now is writing or
00:10 - architecting code myself however I do
00:12 - treat chat GPT kind of like a low paid
00:15 - intern where I'm handing it off kind of
00:17 - smaller tasks and that would be faster
00:19 - for me to describe to the AI than to
00:21 - write from scratch by myself now a lot
00:24 - of you might relate to this problem
00:25 - where you're working in some kind of
00:26 - engineering team and if you're in any
00:28 - kind of management role or you're kind
00:29 - of leading other developers oftentimes
00:31 - it's actually faster for you just to
00:33 - write the code and kind of fix a problem
00:35 - than it is to try to describe what needs
00:37 - to be done to someone else so in the
00:40 - situation in which it's very easy for me
00:41 - to describe something I'll go to chat
00:43 - gbt describe that and then have it spit
00:45 - out that code
