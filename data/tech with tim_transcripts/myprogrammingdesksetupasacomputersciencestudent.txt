00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back so in
00:02 - this video i'm going to be showcasing my
00:04 - pc
00:04 - slash programming setup now chances are
00:07 - if it's not your first time on this
00:09 - channel that you've seen this setup
00:10 - before
00:11 - in fact you can see it behind me right
00:13 - now you can see the rgb in the pc you
00:15 - can see the monitor
00:16 - and all of that stuff but i've never
00:18 - done a video where i've actually gone
00:20 - through and showed you exactly what i've
00:21 - used
00:22 - talked about why and potentially made
00:24 - some recommendations if you guys are
00:25 - looking to upgrade your setup
00:27 - so with that said i'll quickly mention
00:29 - that i have an absolutely
00:30 - ridiculously overkill setup here you do
00:33 - not need anything even remotely close to
00:35 - what i have to start programming
00:37 - so please don't feel discouraged if you
00:39 - don't have this stuff don't feel like
00:40 - you need to get any of it this is just
00:42 - me
00:42 - showing you what i use and well i'll
00:44 - tell you if i would recommend some
00:46 - specific items
00:47 - or why i've actually purchased them so
00:49 - let's go ahead and get started and i
00:50 - will talk to you about my pc
00:52 - programming setup
01:02 - so i'll start by just giving you a
01:04 - general overview of this setup kind of
01:05 - showing you what it looks like
01:07 - and talking to you a bit about what i
01:08 - actually use this setup for
01:10 - so first of all the space that i'm
01:12 - located in which is pretty important is
01:14 - in the basement of my parents house
01:16 - now i have a really large room the room
01:18 - that i'm in actually used to be a
01:20 - theater room i have a projector up there
01:22 - and there's like a big flat screen kind
01:23 - of projector screen on the other side
01:26 - we actually renovated and modified this
01:28 - room specifically for me
01:29 - so i was really fortunate that my dad's
01:31 - actually quite handy he built like a big
01:33 - massive door
01:35 - and then there's this big massive l desk
01:37 - that we built specifically for this room
01:39 - so that kind of starts the setup off but
01:41 - what i use this space
01:42 - for is the following so i am a
01:44 - programmer i am
01:46 - a student and i am also a content
01:48 - creator so a lot of the equipment that i
01:50 - have here especially a lot of the
01:51 - expensive equipment
01:52 - is actually primarily used for content
01:54 - creation right so my lights my camera my
01:56 - microphones all of that kind of stuff
01:58 - and then i just kind of tie that
02:00 - together with my programming setup
02:02 - quote-unquote
02:03 - so i have my monitors my keyboard my
02:05 - mouse my computer
02:07 - my lights all that kind of stuff which
02:08 - is specific really for the programming
02:11 - aspect
02:11 - so i'll try to distinguish between those
02:13 - things in this video but just keep that
02:15 - in mind that a lot of the equipment that
02:16 - i have here
02:17 - is simply because i am a content creator
02:20 - and will i need that kind of stuff to be
02:21 - able to make videos that look like this
02:24 - so the order in which i discuss these
02:26 - items has no significant importance so
02:28 - you don't need to read into that
02:29 - but the first items that i'm going to
02:30 - talk about here are my monitors
02:32 - now i will start by saying that i highly
02:34 - recommend anyone that's programming has
02:37 - at least
02:37 - two monitors or one very large screen
02:40 - like an ultra wide monitor
02:41 - i cannot stress how much of a difference
02:44 - this makes
02:45 - being able to have your code on one
02:46 - screen and then have stack overflow or
02:48 - spotify or whatever
02:50 - else it is on the other screen is super
02:52 - important and well i honestly don't know
02:53 - what i would do without a dual monitor
02:55 - setup
02:56 - now that said what i have here is
02:57 - actually kind of a combination of both
02:59 - the things i recommended
03:00 - so what i have here is a 27 inch q
03:03 - monitor with an 144hz refresh rate and a
03:06 - 2k resolution
03:07 - and this here is the lg 34 inch ultra
03:10 - wide monitor
03:11 - now i need to tell you about this
03:12 - monitor because this thing is amazing
03:14 - it's actually
03:15 - game changing and honestly i think i
03:17 - could suffice by just using the lg
03:20 - monitor
03:20 - because it's massive and well for
03:22 - programming it's so nice to be able to
03:24 - have
03:24 - three separate windows vertically on one
03:26 - display
03:27 - now lg was actually kind enough to
03:29 - sponsor this video and send me over this
03:31 - monitor for free
03:32 - so like i said it is a 34 inch ultra
03:34 - wide monitor that has a 1340 by 1440p
03:37 - resolution this gives it a 21x9 aspect
03:40 - ratio and makes the same height as my 27
03:42 - inch monitor
03:43 - this monitor is pretty much designed for
03:45 - programmers and comes with some great
03:46 - software that allows you to split the
03:48 - screen
03:48 - into multiple unique layouts it is game
03:51 - changing to be able to view multiple
03:52 - sized windows side by side
03:54 - and especially great for using an ide or
03:56 - navigating large code files
03:58 - it has definitely increased my
03:59 - productivity and if you want to get an
04:00 - idea of what it can do for you
04:02 - then head over to lg's ultrawide
04:04 - festival website where you can customize
04:05 - your own ultra wide monitor
04:07 - by customizing your own monitor you'll
04:09 - be entered for a chance to win one or
04:11 - get a 50
04:12 - amazon gift card now lg also has a sense
04:14 - of humor which you can find in their
04:16 - campaign video which is a pretty funny
04:18 - skit of a developer not being able to
04:20 - find his
04:20 - error because while his screen was not
04:23 - large enough so anyways another big
04:24 - thank you to lg
04:26 - you can check them in this monitor out
04:27 - from the link in the description and now
04:29 - let's get into the rest of my
04:30 - programming setup
04:32 - so now i'm going to talk about my
04:33 - computers now notice that is plural i do
04:36 - actually have multiple machines that i
04:37 - use
04:38 - some for development some not so much
04:40 - for development but i will go through
04:42 - them so the first computer i have is my
04:43 - laptop this is a 16-inch macbook pro
04:46 - i got this last year this is the i guess
04:49 - 2019 version
04:50 - i don't actually know if they have a
04:51 - newer version and it's the base model it
04:53 - is a six
04:54 - core i7 16 gigabytes of ram and i used
04:57 - to use this for programming when i was
04:59 - in school
05:00 - i actually do like uh programming on
05:02 - macs and this is a great computer
05:03 - because the 16 inch display is really
05:05 - nice
05:05 - and i actually don't mind the keyboard
05:07 - at all so really a great computer i
05:09 - definitely recommend it if you have the
05:10 - budget for it
05:11 - but recently since i've been back at
05:13 - home this computer really
05:15 - all it's been doing is actually just
05:16 - running my audio so i have logic pro on
05:18 - it and that records all the audio for my
05:21 - videos
05:21 - and apply some filters and all of that
05:23 - kind of stuff now i do have this setup
05:25 - with a docking station so if i want i
05:27 - can turn this whole monitor and pc setup
05:30 - into like the mac setup so i can run off
05:32 - of this computer
05:33 - and i have a keyboard mouse switch which
05:36 - means i just press a button and my
05:37 - keyboard and mouse will switch between
05:38 - the mac
05:39 - and the windows computer so obviously
05:41 - that leads me to my windows machine
05:42 - which is my big powerful workstation
05:45 - which i use like
05:46 - 90 percent of the time i really just
05:48 - like working on desktop computers that's
05:50 - just my preference and this thing you'll
05:52 - understand why i want to work on it
05:53 - it is a ryzen 9 3900x processor that's a
05:57 - 12 core processor in there
05:58 - i have an rtx titan or a titan rtx
06:01 - whatever you call it
06:02 - nvidia actually sent that to me i was
06:04 - not crazy enough to buy that graphics
06:06 - card don't worry
06:07 - and it has 64 gigabytes of ram and then
06:09 - there's two
06:10 - m.2 two terabyte ssds one of them
06:13 - is booting into windows and then i have
06:15 - another ssd so a third ssd that's one
06:18 - terabyte
06:19 - that runs my dual boot into ubuntu so
06:21 - usually i do my programming on windows
06:23 - some people might cringe at that but
06:25 - when i'm making videos and stuff a lot
06:27 - of times like most of you guys are using
06:28 - windows
06:29 - so i try to mirror that by having my
06:31 - main computer being on windows
06:32 - but sometimes if i'm doing some more
06:34 - specific things i will boot into the
06:36 - ubuntu os
06:37 - and honestly i don't have a crazy
06:38 - preference over the operating systems i
06:40 - know how to use them all
06:42 - and i'll just you know use which ones i
06:44 - would need to for
06:45 - specific tasks now i do have a third
06:47 - computer this is more of just a server
06:49 - build
06:49 - so this is i won't talk about it too
06:51 - much but it's like a 10 terabyte server
06:52 - just sitting kind of in the corner of my
06:54 - room
06:55 - and that's what i use for storing all of
06:56 - my video files all of my audio files
06:59 - editing files and just
07:00 - all that kind of stuff that i don't want
07:02 - clogging up my main machine
07:04 - so those are my main computers you can
07:05 - now probably imagine why i prefer to use
07:07 - the desktop machine
07:08 - and now let's move on and now moving on
07:11 - to the keyboard
07:12 - so obviously your keyboard is going to
07:13 - be one of the most important items in a
07:15 - programming setup
07:16 - and well i can give you my
07:18 - recommendations for which ones i like
07:19 - but this really comes down to preference
07:21 - everyone prefers different types of
07:23 - switches different amounts of travel
07:25 - and well you're just gonna have to kind
07:26 - of research and mess around with some
07:27 - different keyboards until you figure out
07:29 - which one you like
07:30 - now personally i've used many different
07:32 - keyboards over the years right now i
07:33 - actually have about six
07:34 - keyboards in this room and my favorite
07:37 - types of switches i do really prefer
07:39 - mechanical keyboards
07:40 - are cherry mx brown and cherry mx blue
07:43 - now the cherry mx brown is something
07:44 - that has a little bit of a less audible
07:46 - click to it
07:47 - i believe it is a lighter amount of
07:49 - pressure that you need to apply to it
07:51 - and then the cherry mx blue has more
07:52 - pressure and it's that nice like kind of
07:54 - clicky
07:54 - sound the keyboard that i'm actually
07:56 - using right now is the das
07:58 - keyboard 4c tkl now i really do like
08:01 - this keyboard it is different than some
08:03 - of the other ones that i've used there's
08:04 - no rgb on it and it also is a shorter
08:06 - size keyboard
08:07 - so it doesn't have that numb pad on the
08:09 - end and honestly i never use the numpad
08:12 - i actually
08:12 - can't think of a situation where i've
08:14 - ever had to use the numpad
08:16 - so that's nice to have it a little bit
08:17 - shorter but it's not one of those
08:18 - keyboards that's like all mushed
08:19 - together
08:20 - and has the arrow keys mixed in with all
08:21 - the other keys because i really do like
08:23 - to have the arrow keys kind of separated
08:25 - from the other part of the keyboard
08:27 - so that when i'm navigating a code file
08:28 - it's really easy to move around
08:30 - this one also has two usb ports on the
08:32 - side it's cherry mx brown switches and
08:34 - it has a soft
08:35 - tactile typing experience so that's what
08:38 - i've been using for right now would
08:39 - highly recommend
08:40 - and in fact das keyboard was actually
08:42 - nice enough to send over two of these
08:44 - keyboards
08:45 - one that i'm using and one that i can
08:46 - give away to you guys so if you want to
08:48 - be entered to win
08:49 - a das keyboard for ctkl i will handle
08:52 - the shipping i will send it to you
08:53 - wherever you are
08:54 - in the world then go ahead and join my
08:56 - discord server there will be a link for
08:58 - that in the description
08:59 - and there'll be a channel somewhere in
09:00 - there that says giveaway you just have
09:02 - to follow some basic instructions you
09:04 - will be entered and then
09:05 - whoever wins well i will send you the
09:07 - key so now i'll move on to the mouse
09:09 - the mouse that i'm using right now is
09:11 - actually the logitech mx
09:13 - master i think that's the exact model of
09:16 - it i am going to link all this stuff in
09:17 - the description so you can check there
09:18 - if i made a mistake
09:19 - but this mouse is amazing this has a ton
09:22 - of different buttons it has this really
09:23 - cool button like where my thumb is
09:25 - it has the forward button the backwards
09:27 - button it has a vertical scroll as well
09:29 - as a horizontal scroll
09:30 - and the coolest thing about this mouse
09:33 - is the scroll wheel
09:34 - so it has a setting so there's this
09:35 - little button where i can toggle the
09:37 - speed of the scroll wheel and i can make
09:39 - it do
09:39 - infinite scrolling and what that means
09:40 - is i can like flick the scroll wheel
09:43 - and it will never stop it will just keep
09:44 - well it will but it will take a really
09:46 - long time to stop it'll just keep
09:47 - spinning
09:48 - super fast and this is amazing for
09:50 - programming because if i'm in a really
09:52 - large file and i want to quickly get
09:53 - down to the bottom of it all i have to
09:55 - do is just flick the mouse scroll wheel
09:57 - and it will automatically realize that
09:59 - i'm trying to scroll really fast
10:00 - and just boom start going all the way
10:02 - down to the bottom of the file
10:04 - seriously a game changer this is an
10:05 - expensive mouse but it feels
10:07 - great in my hand i'm not sponsored by
10:09 - them or anything like that but i just
10:11 - highly recommend it and seriously like
10:13 - one of the cheaper items in my setup
10:15 - that makes a massive difference for
10:17 - my efficiency when i'm navigating and
10:19 - working through different codes
10:21 - so now i'll quickly discuss my chair so
10:23 - obviously you can see the chair that i'm
10:24 - sitting in right now
10:25 - i really like the chairs that have a
10:27 - super high back i like something that i
10:29 - can lean
10:29 - all the way back in this has a tilt as
10:32 - well as a recline feature which is
10:34 - really nice
10:34 - obviously i can adjust the armrests i
10:36 - can move them to the side i can move
10:38 - them up and down
10:39 - it has the lumbar support cushion it has
10:41 - the neck cushion
10:43 - and this is just a great chair it's also
10:44 - on wheels which is really nice
10:46 - now i wouldn't necessarily recommend
10:48 - this chair just because this
10:49 - is kind of you know like a gaming like
10:51 - racing chair kind of thing
10:53 - and i had got it just because people had
10:55 - recommended that i buy something like
10:56 - this but looking back i probably would
10:58 - have rather
10:58 - get something that's more of an
11:00 - ergonomic chair i think this one is
11:02 - pretty comfortable but from what i've
11:03 - seen it's not the best for your back
11:05 - now i'm young enough that that's
11:07 - probably fine but i am considering
11:09 - getting a nicer chair that has like kind
11:10 - of a more
11:11 - curvature and like ergonomic structure
11:13 - to it so i won't necessarily recommend
11:15 - this chair i'll just say that this is
11:16 - what i'm currently using and it's fine
11:18 - it's a high quality chair but there
11:20 - definitely is some better options out
11:21 - there
11:22 - so now i'll talk about some of the more
11:23 - random and kind of quirky things in my
11:26 - setup and why i have those
11:27 - so first of all i have a really nice mat
11:30 - on the ground that i always put my feet
11:31 - on
11:32 - this is actually a bath mat funny enough
11:34 - but it's just super comfortable i've
11:35 - used it for a long time and it's just
11:37 - great i just love having something
11:38 - that's kind of like warm and fuzzy
11:40 - on the ground when i'm programming just
11:42 - makes it much nicer to be there
11:44 - i also have a little fan that i have on
11:46 - my desk i mean it's kind of a given why
11:48 - i would have that
11:49 - i have a speaker this is a beats pill
11:51 - that's just what i use for my audio
11:53 - i also have air pods i use those just so
11:55 - i'm on like a conference call or if i'm
11:57 - you know like in some kind of google
11:58 - meet or zoom call or something like that
12:00 - of course i have my microphone this is a
12:02 - really high-end microphone this is a
12:04 - rode nt1
12:06 - it actually is an xlr input microphone
12:08 - and what that means is i need a usb
12:10 - audio interface to be able to get this
12:11 - to work
12:12 - so without getting into too much detail
12:14 - that little red box you see there is a
12:16 - scarlet
12:16 - 4i4 i believe that's what it's called
12:19 - and that's what i use to actually take
12:21 - my audio from the xlr input and
12:23 - get it into a usb signal so that i can
12:25 - put it into my computer
12:26 - now what i'm actually doing is i'm
12:28 - running all my audio into my mac
12:29 - and then my mac is outputting the audio
12:31 - back to the scarlet so it's filtering it
12:33 - and having the output go through that
12:35 - and then from the scarlet i have an
12:36 - output jack and that output jack is
12:38 - running into my main computer so in
12:40 - theory i could stream my one audio
12:42 - source to both of my computers at the
12:43 - exact same time
12:45 - i could also stream it to other output
12:46 - sources if i wanted to because this
12:48 - specific device has four outputs on the
12:50 - back of it
12:51 - so that's it for the audio interface i
12:53 - also happen to have a ups
12:55 - underneath my desk that is an
12:56 - uninterruptible power supply
12:58 - that's really important because if i'm
13:00 - working on a file if i'm filming a video
13:02 - if i'm doing something like that
13:03 - obviously i don't want a power surge
13:05 - making me lose all of my progress
13:06 - so i have my server and i have all my of
13:09 - my other important hardware devices
13:10 - plugged into that ups
13:12 - and the next two things i'm going to
13:13 - mention are actually the most underrated
13:15 - items in my setup i absolutely love them
13:17 - i will not make a pc
13:19 - programming setup without having these
13:21 - items in it the first is my
13:23 - fidget toys so i have two fidget
13:25 - spinners and i have this like
13:27 - fidget flip thing i have no idea what
13:29 - it's actually called but it's like
13:31 - a square and it like kind of rolls
13:33 - around on the table
13:34 - but i just love having something to
13:36 - fidget with i always find myself
13:37 - reaching for like a pen or a fidget
13:39 - spinner
13:39 - or that little cube thing whatever i'm
13:41 - programming or i'm trying to think about
13:43 - something pretty deeply
13:44 - next i also have e-reading lamps so
13:47 - these are really cool
13:48 - these lamps are specifically designed to
13:50 - be put over top of your monitor
13:52 - so they're anti-glare and they really
13:54 - are just designed to make it easier to
13:56 - view your screen
13:57 - now i won't go into too much detail on
13:58 - this but like i think the science behind
14:00 - it is like you need adequate lighting
14:02 - when you're looking
14:02 - at a computer screen and they just hang
14:05 - right over top of the screen
14:06 - kind of illuminate the desk area which
14:08 - is really nice if i'm like writing notes
14:09 - or something
14:10 - and they just make it kind of easier on
14:12 - your eyes to stare at the screen for a
14:13 - long period of time
14:14 - these lights also have a brightness and
14:17 - temperature adjustment
14:18 - so really cool and just super underrated
14:20 - i would highly recommend them they make
14:22 - an
14:22 - absolutely massive difference finally
14:25 - you can see i have a usb hub sitting on
14:27 - my desk that's just because i ran out of
14:29 - usb ports on my computer
14:31 - and then my mac is sitting on top of
14:33 - this like little
14:34 - fan thing so i don't even really know
14:36 - what to call it i guess it's like a
14:37 - laptop stand and it has fans underneath
14:39 - it that just blow
14:40 - cool air onto my macbook pro so that way
14:43 - the macbook pro fan itself doesn't rev
14:45 - up and be really loud especially when
14:46 - i'm recording videos like this
14:48 - so definitely a super cool purchase that
14:50 - was like 40 bucks and that means that my
14:51 - macbook pro fan
14:52 - just like never spins up and i have a
14:54 - quieter fan underneath it that is
14:56 - handling its actual cooling
14:58 - so with that the last thing i will say
14:59 - is i also have an ipad pro
15:01 - now i just got this and this is honestly
15:03 - like such a cool device i have the apple
15:05 - pencil with it
15:06 - and just for taking notes or doing any
15:08 - kind of like drawings or math or
15:10 - anything like that
15:11 - super awesome i don't think i'm ever
15:13 - really gonna have to use paper again
15:15 - and well that kind of concludes my setup
15:17 - tour
15:18 - of course i have all my studio equipment
15:20 - and lights and stuff i mean that's not
15:21 - really part of the pc
15:23 - programming setup so i'm not gonna go
15:25 - into that in depth
15:26 - but yeah that is what i have that is
15:28 - what i use and i would love to hear your
