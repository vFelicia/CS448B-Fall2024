00:00 - hey guys and welcome back so in today's
00:02 - video I'm gonna be going through an
00:04 - anaconda tutorial so explaining and
00:06 - walking you through how anaconda works
00:08 - why it works what commands we can use
00:10 - how to create new environments how to
00:12 - use those environments and how to manage
00:14 - them now this is a very important skill
00:15 - um if you're working in a large project
00:18 - where you multiple projects on your
00:20 - computer you know when you use something
00:21 - called virtual environments now whether
00:23 - you use anaconda to do that or just like
00:25 - the built-in virtual environment is up
00:27 - to you but anaconda is a great choice a
00:29 - lot of people end up using it just
00:31 - because they see it in like a tutorial
00:32 - video but essentially it's a great way
00:34 - to manage your Python packages and have
00:37 - different Python versions running on
00:39 - your machine at once so obviously the
00:42 - first step is gonna be to download and
00:43 - install anaconda so once we've done that
00:46 - this is just the website by the way I'll
00:48 - leave the link in the description you
00:49 - can download it just make sure when
00:51 - you're downloading it if you don't
00:52 - already have an installed is you check
00:54 - the little box that says add Conda to
00:57 - path now this is important because we
00:59 - want to make sure that we're gonna be
01:00 - able to use the commands in our command
01:02 - prompt now for some reason what I'm
01:04 - about to do doesn't work for you just
01:06 - let me know in the comments I'll try to
01:07 - help you out okay so if I go to CMD it's
01:10 - gonna be our next step here nice I can
01:12 - close this actually what we're gonna
01:14 - start first start by typing is Conda
01:16 - okay assuming you have everything
01:18 - installed now if this shows up you get
01:20 - some nice text then you're good you're
01:22 - ready to go if this doesn't show up
01:24 - trying to reinstall anaconda and do the
01:27 - checkbox that says what do you call it
01:29 - add Conda to path now if you already
01:31 - have virtual environments I will warn
01:33 - you that it may override those
01:34 - environments but you do want to find a
01:37 - way to get connor to your pass you're
01:38 - able to do what I'm gonna do now
01:39 - otherwise you're gonna have to use the
01:41 - Conda what do you call it there should
01:44 - be like an anaconda thing anaconda
01:46 - navigator you're gonna have to use this
01:48 - app and if you use that you could
01:49 - probably figure out what to do okay I
01:50 - might go through it later now
01:52 - essentially what we're gonna want start
01:53 - off by doing is create a new virtual
01:55 - environment so to do this we're gonna do
01:57 - Conda creates - n then the name of our
02:00 - environment in this case I'm just gonna
02:01 - call mine test and then you're gonna do
02:04 - your Python version so let's get
02:05 - something to say python equals and then
02:07 - whatever version i want so let's go
02:08 - three six okay so again Conda create
02:13 - - n the name and then whatever version
02:16 - you want now already you can hopefully
02:18 - see the advantage of Conda we're allowed
02:19 - to have Python versions that aren't the
02:22 - current version so if you go to the
02:23 - Python website yes you can download
02:24 - other versions but having multiple of
02:26 - them on your machine will allow you or
02:29 - like you will run into errors doing that
02:31 - so essentially doing this you can choose
02:33 - the Python version you can use it will
02:34 - store it all nicely and you won't run
02:36 - into any errors so we're gonna use three
02:37 - point six I'll hit enter enter I don't
02:41 - know why this isn't working okay there
02:43 - we go so now it's gonna solve and set up
02:45 - the environment now I'll wait for this
02:48 - to be done I'll be right back okay so
02:50 - the condo environment is set up now it's
02:51 - ready to go
02:52 - we called ours test now the next step
02:54 - and it's actually telling us what to do
02:56 - here is to activate the environment so
02:58 - it says to activate this environment use
03:00 - activate test so let's do that
03:02 - activate test now when we do that you
03:04 - should see that you get these little
03:07 - brackets and it says the name of your
03:09 - environment and then that your command
03:10 - line is after that now if this is
03:12 - working you've done everything
03:13 - successful good job we're ready to go so
03:16 - essentially what we're doing now is
03:18 - we're in our virtual environment which
03:19 - means whatever we do in here will only
03:21 - be applied to our virtual environment
03:23 - which is really nice because it means we
03:24 - can install packages they won't affect
03:27 - other things on a machine it'll only
03:28 - affect this virtual environment so what
03:31 - we're gonna do now is we're gonna
03:32 - install package let's say pip install
03:36 - hmmm what's the interesting package I
03:39 - want to use this one for an example PI
03:40 -  okay so I'm going to install PI
03:42 -  we'll wait for this to run and
03:44 - still and then I'll be right back okay
03:46 - so that actually installed way faster
03:48 - than I assumed but anyways we're in so
03:50 - now this is where you'd want to install
03:52 - all the packages you're gonna need to
03:53 - use for your project so what you can do
03:55 - is well obviously just keep typing pip
03:58 - install and then the name of all the
04:00 - packages say you want numpy so you want
04:03 - discord I don't know whatever you want
04:05 - this is where you're gonna install it
04:07 - now just notice if for some reason let's
04:09 - say you closed this command prompt
04:10 - alright and you want to install more
04:13 - packages or later on you realize you
04:14 - need another package you don't want to
04:15 - create a new environment you want to
04:16 - install the 20 or you have what you can
04:19 - do is run the command prompt okay I'll
04:21 - drag that back to the center
04:22 - you can type activate and then you can
04:24 - activate your environment again so
04:26 - this case will activate tests and this
04:28 - is just to show you that you don't have
04:30 - to do that directly after in creating
04:32 - the environment you can do it at any
04:33 - time you want okay so we've got tests
04:35 - now if we want to see all the packages
04:38 - in our environment we can ukon the list
04:40 - and this will go through and it shows
04:41 - you all your packages CI pip pymongo
04:44 - Python whatnot and then if you want to
04:47 - remove a package
04:48 - I believe you can just do kondeh remove
04:51 - and then just name the package that
04:54 - should hopefully work let's see what it
04:56 - says recon remove uh okay I don't know
04:59 - that's probably how you do it you guys
05:01 - can ask me if you're trying to do that
05:02 - anyways so now let's go to hack sheet
05:05 - how to actually use this environment so
05:07 - I just want to show you an example here
05:08 - say you have like IDL e installed and
05:11 - most people do they have this installed
05:13 - on their machine this is the first
05:14 - version of Python you installed and
05:16 - after you install this you installed
05:17 - anaconda okay now notice like you've
05:20 - just installed pymongo right into this
05:22 - virtual environment but watch what
05:24 - happens if I try to import pymongo here
05:27 - no module named PI but what we
05:30 - have pi here why is it not working
05:32 - now the issue is this is a different
05:35 - version of python than the one you've
05:37 - just created and this is your base
05:38 - python installation and have an
05:41 - installed pymongo into that virtual
05:43 - environment you've only installed it
05:45 - into this one so how can we actually run
05:48 - our python script maybe we're writing it
05:50 - using ideally we did a new file we wrote
05:52 - our code and now when we hit f5 it's not
05:55 - working we can install our packages well
05:57 - the way to actually run your python
05:59 - script is from the command line now it
06:01 - may seem kind of difficult or annoying
06:03 - to do this but if you're not using like
06:05 - an an IDE this is the way you pretty
06:08 - will have to do it so let's say on my
06:11 - desktop here I have this Q based
06:13 - algorithm ok that will run that script
06:15 - so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
06:16 - change directory to my desktop so I'll
06:18 - say CD desktop and now I'm in my virtual
06:22 - environment still still says test and
06:24 - I'm on my desktop now what I'm gonna do
06:26 - if I want to run a Python script just
06:28 - all I have to do is Python and then the
06:30 - name of the script so in this case mine
06:31 - is called Q based algorithm so just a
06:34 - shortcut here by the way if you don't
06:35 - realize what I'm doing is I'm just
06:36 - typing the first few letters then
06:38 - hitting tout it's automatically Jan
06:40 - the next line for me so I'll hit I'll do
06:42 - Python Cubase Algren up I hit enter and
06:45 - then you can see it actually prints out
06:47 - the what he call it the result of that
06:50 - for me and it runs that script for me if
06:52 - you're running a graphical user
06:53 - interface like a game it would load up
06:55 - the game for you and this is how you can
06:57 - run things with your virtual environment
06:59 - so I'll do like a quick test for you
07:01 - just to prove that this really does work
07:03 - so I go file new file and we'll just say
07:05 - import PI ok let's save that as
07:08 - just del on my desktop and watch what
07:11 - happens when I hit f5 no module name
07:14 - pymongo right because we're using three
07:16 - point seven point one but now so this is
07:18 - the file Dallas should be on my desktop
07:20 - it's right here I'm on my desktop watch
07:22 - what happens when I'm in my virtual
07:24 - environment I run it so python if i
07:27 - clicked on that properly python del dog
07:29 - py you see no errors everything is fine
07:32 - because we have pi mangu installed in
07:35 - this virtual environment and that's the
07:36 - python we're using to run del so that is
07:39 - essentially how that works
07:40 - now if you want to see a list of all of
07:42 - your different environments what you can
07:44 - do is Conda list env I believe oh I
07:50 - think it's like this Conda env list
07:53 - let's see yeah and there we go so that
07:55 - lists all of the environments for you so
07:56 - you can see I have my base environment
07:58 - discord new web meaning go through and
08:01 - see all them times here tensorflow
08:02 - obviously this one which is the one
08:04 - we're currently and wide as a star now I
08:06 - just want to show you quickly you can
08:08 - deactivate your environment by typing
08:10 - deactivate obviously it'll bring you
08:12 - back to the lost environment you were in
08:14 - in this case we're in actually what's
08:15 - known as the Conda base environment and
08:17 - if we try to install something in here
08:20 - it's like pip install and then you do
08:22 - something here what's gonna happen is
08:24 - Reutimann's actually installed into the
08:25 - base Carnot environment now that's fine
08:28 - but that means when you want to run
08:29 - something you just type Python like
08:33 - without activating environment or you
08:35 - can type activate just to activate Conda
08:37 - so you'll see this action in a second so
08:38 - I type activate you see it brings me
08:40 - this base environment and then what I
08:42 - can do is I a new Python and like delve
08:45 - py but notice that when I do that oh
08:48 - that's actually working for some reason
08:50 - in my base environment anyways
08:53 - that is essentially how that works so
08:55 - you have a base environment you can
08:57 - install packages in there as well but
08:58 - typically it's a good idea to install
09:00 - them inside of like their own
09:02 - environment and use them for different
09:04 - reasons right so for different projects
09:06 - you have different environment to use
09:07 - those environments so last thing if you
09:09 - want to delete an environment so let's
09:10 - say we want to get rid of this one it's
09:12 - pretty easy to do this you can just do
09:13 - Conda remove env - n and then the name
09:17 - of your environment which is tests of
09:19 - Conda remove environment and standing
09:22 - for the name test watch what happens
09:24 - when I hit enter you can see it goes
09:26 - it's gonna solve the environments
09:27 - following packages are missing Condor
09:29 - and move hmm
09:32 - Conda env removed I believe is what this
09:34 - my bad guys so Conda env remove - and
09:37 - test so run that and there you go it
09:40 - says these are gonna be removed hit yes
09:42 - and you can see it removes it from our
09:44 - system and that is essentially how you
09:45 - use anaconda how you set up virtual
09:48 - environments and that's probably the
09:49 - reason why if you guys have been using
09:51 - it and then trying to do stuff here it's
09:52 - not working if you want to run something
09:54 - you have to do it from the command line
09:56 - or set up this as an interpreter for
09:58 - your project which you can do using a PI
10:00 - charm and Jupiter notebooks and whatnot
