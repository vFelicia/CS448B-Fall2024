00:00 - second way I have you to get better at
00:02 - programming is something that I say on
00:04 - this channel constantly and I apologize
00:05 - if you if you guys have heard it a ton
00:07 - of times now you're getting tired of it
00:08 - but this is to work on projects a lot of
00:11 - people that work on projects will pick
00:12 - something that they've built 100 times
00:14 - they'll go build a clone of something or
00:15 - they'll build something that they're
00:17 - very very familiar with and comfortable
00:18 - with what you should do is pick a
00:19 - project that is challenging something
00:21 - that's outside of your comfort zone
00:22 - something that you have no idea how to
00:24 - accomplish and then as you work on this
00:26 - project you'll go and look things up
00:28 - you'll watch a few videos and
00:29 - immediately you'll take that knowledge
00:31 - and actually be able to apply that into
00:33 - your code and see if you're
00:35 - understanding it and learn a ton working
00:37 - on projects is just a really really
00:38 - great way to get better at programming
00:40 - if you're not doing it I highly
00:41 - recommend that you do
