00:00 - learning to code is difficult and it can
00:02 - lead you to feel depressed sad and
00:04 - genuinely wondering what am I doing with
00:06 - my life that's because sometimes you can
00:08 - be going down a seamlessly endless path
00:11 - and you have no idea where the finish
00:13 - line is and if you're actually making
00:14 - progress now the good news is you can
00:17 - avoid that there's a lot of small
00:18 - strategies that you can employ that will
00:20 - keep you motivated and moving towards
00:22 - your goal so with that said stick around
00:24 - for the whole video and let me discuss
00:25 - how you can stay motivated while you're
00:27 - learning how to
00:28 - code
00:32 - step one is to have a goal it doesn't
00:35 - matter what you're doing whether it's
00:36 - coding or any other activity you need to
00:38 - know why you're doing those activities
00:41 - what are you actually trying to achieve
00:43 - why do you want to learn how to code you
00:45 - need to genuinely sit down and ask
00:47 - yourself those few questions what is my
00:49 - goal here why am I learning to code and
00:52 - what am I going to do to achieve that
00:53 - goal once you have the goal in mind I'd
00:56 - highly recommend writing it down put it
00:58 - on a big piece of paper print it out put
01:00 - it as your wallpaper or your desktop
01:02 - screen doesn't matter but you want to
01:03 - constantly remind yourself of that goal
01:06 - so whenever you're feeling down you're
01:07 - getting stuck and things just really
01:09 - aren't going your way you can go and
01:11 - look at that goal and remind yourself
01:12 - why you're doing these activities in the
01:14 - first place for me the only way I can
01:16 - stay motivated is if I know I'm making
01:18 - progress if I'm moving in the right
01:20 - direction but I need to know what that
01:22 - direction is so I need to have an
01:24 - overarching goal now your goal could be
01:26 - to get a job it could be to work on a
01:28 - project it could be to get enough know
01:30 - to be comfortable talking with an
01:31 - engineering team doesn't matter what it
01:33 - is but be very specific write it down
01:36 - and keep that in mind whenever you're
01:38 - learning to
01:41 - code now if your goal is to actually
01:43 - land a job you'll be interested to hear
01:45 - that I just released a new software
01:47 - development course where the entire goal
01:49 - of that course is to land you a job as
01:51 - you graduate that program now the way we
01:54 - do that is we connect you with a network
01:56 - of employers so as soon as you graduate
01:58 - our course they can actually see your
01:59 - your exam grades we test you every step
02:01 - of the way we have a proced final exam
02:04 - and they know that you already have all
02:06 - the skills necessary to be a great
02:08 - Junior developer and they interview you
02:10 - directly from our platform in fact they
02:12 - actually pay us money to interview you
02:14 - because we've already vetted you as one
02:16 - of the best possible candidates now the
02:18 - way this works is you go through a
02:19 - software development fundamentals course
02:21 - which is taught by me and then you pick
02:23 - a specialization in frontend backend or
02:26 - devops all included in the price of the
02:27 - course and this is taught by an industry
02:30 - expert in that field for example Kyle
02:32 - from webdev simplified the massive
02:34 - YouTube channel is the instructor of the
02:36 - frontend course and that course alone
02:37 - has over 50 hours of content that will
02:40 - quite literally make you the best
02:41 - possible candidate for any Junior level
02:44 - front- end position this is a massive
02:46 - course we have a ton of features with
02:47 - this guys I'm super excited about it and
02:49 - I know it's going to help tons of you
02:51 - land jobs if you're interested guys
02:53 - check it out from the link in the
02:54 - description we also have a community so
02:56 - you can connect with all of the
02:57 - different students myself and an expert
02:59 - ring of of coaches that will help you
03:01 - every step of the
03:04 - way now once you come up with a goal
03:07 - what you really need is some structure
03:08 - to your learning you need to design some
03:10 - kind of curriculum or road map that
03:12 - you're going to follow so that you can
03:14 - track your progress day by day and you
03:16 - can see how you're progressing towards
03:18 - your goal it's well worth spending a day
03:21 - researching and coming up with the exact
03:23 - skills that you need to learn to reach
03:25 - your end goal now if your goal is to get
03:27 - a job then you're going to want to
03:28 - follow a curriculum like some from my
03:30 - course even if you don't pay for the
03:31 - course you can go check it out for free
03:33 - you can view the exact curriculum and
03:35 - you can learn that on your own obviously
03:37 - that's going to be a lot more
03:38 - challenging but if you don't have the
03:39 - money for a structured program then you
03:41 - can just go to those programs see what
03:43 - they're teaching compare a few few
03:45 - different of them sorry and then
03:46 - actually write down the curriculum for
03:48 - yourself and learn each of those
03:49 - individual topics either way you need to
03:52 - have some kind of structure you need to
03:54 - be able to see where you are and the
03:55 - fact that you're making progress and
03:57 - kind of Crossing off each topic step
03:59 - step by
04:02 - step now once you have a goal and you
04:05 - have some kind of curriculum that you're
04:06 - following you'll naturally find that you
04:08 - have this sense of progression you can
04:10 - see that you're moving forward step by
04:12 - step day by day and even if it's slowly
04:15 - you're going to get this sense of
04:16 - achievement because you're actually
04:17 - accomplishing the steps towards your
04:19 - goal but once you have that if you want
04:21 - to make this even better I'd recommend
04:23 - that you join a community now there's
04:25 - all kinds of communities online you can
04:27 - join Discord servers for example I have
04:29 - a Discord server
04:30 - discord.gg WT we actually have an
04:33 - exclusive Discord server for my course
04:35 - where you can network with other
04:36 - students coaches instructors like myself
04:39 - Etc regardless you can also find one on
04:41 - Reddit you can go and find some on blogs
04:44 - you can just become the kind of an
04:45 - active member of a live stream or
04:47 - something whatever there's all kinds of
04:49 - online communities that you can join and
04:51 - if you just search like coding
04:52 - communities coding group learn to code
04:55 - you'll find all kinds of them you can
04:57 - mess around and see which ones work best
04:59 - for you but you want to be around people
05:00 - that are like-minded even if you have a
05:02 - friend that's learning how to code it
05:04 - might be helpful to spend one day a week
05:06 - doing some pair programming do a call
05:09 - talk about what you've learned what
05:10 - you're struggling with I found during my
05:12 - computer science degree I was a lot more
05:14 - motivated when I was working with other
05:15 - computer science students I really wish
05:17 - I could give you some more concrete
05:19 - steps here but my general advice try to
05:21 - find some kind of community even if it's
05:23 - one person a friend someone you call
05:25 - once a month having someone to talk to
05:27 - about what you're doing share your
05:28 - experience with with and again here what
05:30 - they're doing is really really valuable
05:32 - and I promise it's going to keep that
05:34 - motivation
05:37 - alive now once you've done all that your
05:40 - motivation will definitely start to grow
05:42 - but you can still implement this next
05:43 - tip which is to remember to work on fun
05:46 - projects it's really easy to get into
05:48 - Grind Mode and just keep doing really
05:50 - grueling tasks and learning a bunch of
05:52 - theory and grinding through your
05:53 - curriculum when at the end of the day
05:55 - coding is fun if you can stop even just
05:58 - one day a week maybe one day every two
06:00 - weeks whatever increment you want and
06:02 - give yourself the freedom to just work
06:03 - on whatever you want that's going to
06:05 - make a massive difference for me when I
06:07 - was younger almost all I did every
06:09 - single day when I was learning to code
06:11 - was work on projects that I found really
06:13 - really fun these weren't practical these
06:15 - weren't things I were going to sell I
06:16 - wasn't going to put them on my resume
06:18 - they were just fun projects that I
06:20 - wanted to build so find some of those
06:22 - for yourself work on something that
06:24 - maybe you don't show to anyone or maybe
06:25 - you want to show to a bunch of people
06:27 - and it's just something that is super
06:28 - fun that doesn't have to be progressing
06:30 - you forward in your journey keeping your
06:33 - passion alive and remembering every day
06:36 - why you chose coding in the first place
06:38 - really helps you keep that motivation
06:40 - and I can't tell you how rewarding it is
06:42 - to sit down for a day or a few hours
06:44 - work on a project and see that you've
06:46 - actually built something that you wanted
06:48 - to build and you had a good time doing
06:50 - so just keep that in mind work on fun
06:52 - projects give yourself that leeway and
06:54 - don't feel like you always have to be
06:56 - striving forward sometimes it's okay to
06:58 - take a break and just do something
07:03 - fun the last and probably most important
07:06 - tip is to not compare yourself to others
07:08 - now sure it can be helpful sometimes for
07:10 - inspiration but typically you don't want
07:12 - to take your progress in your journey
07:14 - and compare that side by side with
07:15 - someone else it's not helpful it's not a
07:18 - fair comparison and almost always it
07:19 - leaves you feeling demoralized and like
07:21 - you're not good enough or not moving
07:23 - fast enough I promise you everyone
07:26 - learns how to code at a completely
07:27 - different pace this is a very very
07:30 - challenging field some people are
07:32 - naturally much better at it than others
07:33 - and it's not fair to take your situation
07:36 - and your journey and compare it to some
07:38 - random person on the internet and say
07:40 - I'm not as good as them I promise you
07:42 - there's things that you're better at
07:43 - than they are and obviously they're
07:44 - better at things than you are but I see
07:46 - this in my YouTube comment section all
07:48 - the time people look at my journey for
07:50 - example and they say well I'm nowhere
07:52 - near as good as you I'll never be at
07:53 - your level I'll never be there it's not
07:55 - a good exercise it's not fair to do that
07:57 - you guys don't know how long I've spent
07:59 - learning to code you don't see the hours
08:01 - that I was sitting 12 13 years old
08:03 - banging my head on the laptop trying to
08:05 - fix a stupid bug trust me I've been
08:07 - through it too everyone has a different
08:09 - journey and what you really want to do
08:11 - is compare yourself to who you were
08:13 - yesterday and make sure that you're
08:14 - making progress and moving in the
08:16 - correct direction that's why I said have
08:18 - a goal have a curriculum join some kind
08:20 - of community and compare yourself to
08:22 - your journey your progress and just make
08:25 - sure you're moving forward and
08:26 - progressing day by day if you do that I
08:28 - promise you're going to stay motivated
08:30 - and this is going to be a much more
08:31 - effective exercise than comparing
08:33 - yourself to
08:35 - [Music]
08:36 - others now if you're someone who's
08:39 - genuinely committed and interested to
08:40 - Landing a software developer job I do
08:43 - have a free introduction course that you
08:44 - can check out from the link in the
08:46 - description it walks you through
08:47 - everything you need to know to actually
08:49 - land a software development position and
08:51 - then if you like that you can actually
08:52 - sign up for the full course and that
08:54 - goes through all the curriculum connects
08:56 - you with the employers gives you the
08:57 - network in the community and all that
08:59 - stuff that I know you guys need I know I
09:01 - talked about this a lot but I'm super
09:03 - passionate about this I spent a very
09:04 - long time building this program and I do
09:07 - genuinely believe it's my best work and
09:09 - what's actually going to help you land a
09:11 - job anyways if you guys enjoy make sure
09:12 - to leave a like subscribe to the channel
