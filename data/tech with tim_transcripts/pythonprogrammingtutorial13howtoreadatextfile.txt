00:00 - hey guys welcome back this is the 13th
00:03 - video in my Python Programming series
00:06 - and today we're going to be talking
00:07 - about reading from a file so
00:09 - specifically a text file and we're going
00:12 - to be using something called
00:14 - file.io in Python so the first thing we
00:17 - need to do before we can read from a
00:18 - file is we need to create a file so I'm
00:21 - just simply going to go and find the
00:23 - directory where my python tutorials are
00:26 - so oops not here they are right here in
00:29 - the tutorials folder um and now you see
00:32 - I've got all my python uh scripts right
00:34 - here and all I'm going to do is I'm
00:35 - going to right click and I'm going to
00:36 - click
00:37 - new and then I'm going to find text
00:40 - document like that now I can name it
00:42 - whatever I like I'm just going to name
00:43 - it file for right now file. text now you
00:48 - may want to populate the uh text
00:50 - document so put some words in here so
00:52 - I'm just going to put a bunch of
00:53 - different words hello Tim
00:56 - python Learning Easy just some random
01:00 - random words in my text file I'm going
01:01 - to save that um and now we can go to
01:04 - reading in the text file so it is
01:08 - important that when you make the text
01:10 - file you do have to save it in the same
01:12 - directory as your python script so if I
01:16 - were to put the text file here on my
01:17 - desktop and I have my python script in
01:20 - the tutorials folder here it's not going
01:21 - to be able to find the file properly um
01:24 - you would have to do something which is
01:25 - a path joining which I'm not going to
01:27 - talk about in this video but maybe in a
01:29 - later
01:30 - so make sure that you save your file in
01:32 - the same directory uh and same folder as
01:35 - where your script is okay so now that
01:38 - we've done that we're going to read from
01:40 - the file so the first thing we need to
01:41 - do is we need to create a variable so
01:43 - we're going to name this file you can
01:44 - name it whatever you'd like and you're
01:46 - going to set it equal to the keyword
01:48 - open and then inside of open all you're
01:51 - going to do is you're going to type the
01:53 - name of your file so file. text a comma
01:57 - and then the mode you want to open your
01:59 - file in so so in this case we want to
02:00 - read it so we're simply going to put a
02:02 - lowercase R inside of the quotations
02:06 - just like that and now that's pretty
02:08 - simple that's all you have to do in
02:10 - Python to open up the file and to
02:12 - prepare to read it now make sure you do
02:15 - put R in here if you put nothing or you
02:18 - put a W for example which would be write
02:20 - mode it's actually going to clear the
02:22 - whole file which you don't want to
02:24 - happen you want to leave the contents of
02:25 - the file in there right so we need to
02:27 - open it in read mode with this R that's
02:29 - very important
02:30 - um now what we're going to do is we're
02:32 - simply going to read all of the things
02:34 - from the file so we've opened the file
02:36 - now we need to read it so in order to
02:38 - read the file uh we have to type a few
02:41 - things so we can do it in multiple
02:43 - different ways the first way I'm going
02:44 - to show you is this so I'm going to make
02:45 - another variable I'm going to call it f
02:47 - and this one we're going to make it
02:48 - equal to file. read
02:52 - lines like this okay and then we can
02:55 - simply print out F just to show you
02:58 - what's going to happen you see we get
03:01 - all of the words that are in the file
03:04 - now there's an interesting thing here
03:05 - you may notice that there's a back sln
03:09 - attached to all of the words except for
03:11 - the last one that's because I'm going to
03:13 - open up the text file again and show you
03:15 - um you notice here I didn't actually
03:17 - type back sln but every time we click
03:19 - enter like this it actually creates
03:22 - something called an escape character
03:25 - which is that back sln so if we want to
03:27 - read in the file we're going to have to
03:29 - remove that um character afterwards
03:31 - right so it's just something to keep in
03:33 - mind that if you have things on
03:34 - different lines each of the end of the
03:36 - lines is going to have a back sln on
03:39 - that line that you don't actually see
03:40 - here in the text document but python
03:42 - will read that
03:44 - in okay so we don't need to save that um
03:48 - yeah so let's move into the second way
03:50 - to read it properly now so we have f
03:52 - equals file. read lines now we want to
03:55 - remove all of these back slashes uh get
03:57 - rid of these ends from our lines so so
03:59 - there's a way we have to do that and
04:00 - it's by using a for Loop so we're going
04:02 - to do a for Loop just going to say for
04:06 - line in F because now F has read all of
04:10 - our lines so we're going to do what's
04:12 - called iterating by item if you remember
04:14 - from my other videos so each line so
04:16 - every item in this F list here that just
04:19 - created by file. read lines we're going
04:21 - to remove that character and we're going
04:23 - to create a new list so let's make a new
04:26 - list we'll call it new list just make it
04:28 - a blank list like this new list and then
04:33 - here we're going to say um what is it
04:37 - new list do append and if you remember
04:40 - what aend does that simply means add to
04:42 - the end um of this new list and then
04:45 - we're going to add the line and we're
04:47 - going to use the slice operator to
04:49 - remove that back sln so we're going to
04:52 - Simply do the colon and then -1 now what
04:56 - this does is we it will take all of line
04:59 - except for the last character so
05:02 - negative one um I didn't talk about this
05:05 - in the other video but negative 1 pretty
05:07 - much just goes to the last character but
05:09 - does not include the last character when
05:10 - you do negative one like this so just
05:12 - just follow along for now you don't have
05:13 - to completely understand it but just put
05:15 - that negative 1 and now if I print out
05:17 - new list we'll see what we get new
05:21 - list F5 and you see we get rid of all of
05:26 - the back slash ends now we have one
05:28 - issue here um down here on ease uh it
05:31 - should say easy but we've actually
05:33 - removed the last back sln from that
05:36 - string so if we don't want to do that
05:38 - now we need to actually add an if
05:39 - statement into our for Loop so inside of
05:42 - the for loop we're going to type if and
05:44 - then we'll say line and we'll put a
05:47 - negative 1 again to represent the last
05:49 - character in that line equals equals
05:52 - back
05:54 - sln and then we'll simply tab this in
05:56 - because remember everything in Python
05:58 - needs to be indented proper properly for
05:59 - it to be read um and now we'll try this
06:02 - and we'll see if this
06:04 - works and there we go so we get hello
06:06 - Tim Python and learning but now we
06:08 - forgotten one thing we haven't actually
06:10 - included easy so now we need to do an
06:13 - else statement so we have else and then
06:15 - we'll do new
06:17 - list. append and we'll simply append the
06:21 - line just like that and now we can print
06:23 - it out and we will see what happens and
06:26 - we get hello Tim python learning and
06:29 - easy now there is an easier way to do
06:32 - this I just wanted to show this example
06:33 - because you may want to do something
06:35 - where you're checking through all of the
06:36 - lines and you want to see if the last
06:39 - character or maybe the first character
06:40 - is equal to a certain item and depending
06:43 - on what that string is or depending on
06:45 - what it is you may want to add it to a
06:47 - new list you may want to do something to
06:48 - it so I just want to show you a way that
06:50 - we can do that pretty much this is
06:52 - iterating through every line in the file
06:55 - so file here so F creates a list of
06:57 - every line and then we go through
06:59 - through every line of it and we see we
07:01 - say if the end of it has this back sln
07:04 - then we're going to remove the back sln
07:06 - um otherwise we'll just add that line
07:08 - into our list right okay so now the
07:11 - easier way that we can do this is
07:12 - actually with something that's called
07:14 - The Strip string method so in my other
07:16 - video I talked about this strip method
07:18 - that removes the spaces but what we can
07:21 - actually do with this uh is we can
07:23 - remove what do you call it sorry we can
07:25 - remove the back sln with the strip
07:28 - method as well so all we have to do here
07:29 - now it's a lot simpler you do new
07:32 - list. append and then inside of here
07:35 - we're simply going to type line. strip
07:39 - and now this will automatically remove
07:40 - those back SL ends and we'll see if this
07:43 - works there we go so we get everything
07:45 - and you can see it's a lot simpler and
07:47 - we don't even have to do the if
07:48 - statement um for the easy like that so
07:52 - that pretty much is how you read a file
07:55 - in using python there are some other
07:57 - ways to do this but this is the most
07:59 - basic and easiest way to understand
08:01 - we've also talked about how to remove
08:03 - that it's called an escape character at
08:05 - the end of the string that back sln and
08:07 - in the next video we're going to talk
08:09 - about writing to a file I hope you
08:11 - learned something if you did please like
08:13 - And subscribe and I will see you again
08:15 - in another video
