00:00 - in this video i'm going to share with
00:01 - you three practical and realistic ways
00:04 - that you can make 500 a month or more
00:07 - from coding now i'm not going to tell
00:09 - you to make a global game you sell for
00:11 - tons of money or run a youtube channel
00:12 - or start a blog or anything like that
00:15 - these are realistic things that you can
00:16 - start today even if you are a beginner
00:19 - programmer if you're someone who's 12 13
00:21 - 14 years old you can definitely do these
00:23 - things and the reason why i'm saying
00:25 - these are realistic is because
00:26 - everything i'm going to mention in this
00:27 - video i have actually done and i did it
00:30 - mostly when i was at the age of between
00:32 - 14 and 18 years old these are meant to
00:34 - be kind of short tasks you take on on a
00:37 - freelance basis and do whenever you have
00:39 - free time to make a little bit of money
00:41 - and gain a bit of experience working
00:42 - with clients and the last thing i will
00:44 - say for this introduction is that you
00:46 - can definitely make much more than 500
00:49 - and as i grew up and got into first
00:50 - second third year of university my
00:52 - income from these tasks increased
00:54 - drastically but i think 500 is a really
00:57 - realistic target and a lot of people
00:59 - would be happy to make that each month
01:01 - especially if you're only spending a few
01:02 - hours and not working on something as a
01:04 - full-time job so with that said let's
01:06 - get into these three methods
01:11 - [Music]
01:17 - all right so let's dive into method
01:18 - number one here which is tutoring now
01:20 - this is personally my favorite method
01:23 - and i found that this makes the most
01:24 - amount of money when you average it out
01:26 - per hour now i understand there's a lot
01:28 - of concerns here with tutoring a bunch
01:30 - of you are probably already yelling at
01:31 - the computer and saying i'm not skilled
01:32 - enough i'm not good enough to tutor i
01:34 - don't have any clients and you're going
01:36 - to list off a thousand excuses that's
01:38 - fine but the reality is you can always
01:40 - find someone to tutor and if you know
01:42 - even one thing more than they do you're
01:44 - still gonna be valuable in being able to
01:45 - teach them or help them out the thing is
01:48 - when most people are looking for a tutor
01:50 - the reason they're doing that is because
01:51 - they struggle to learn stuff on their
01:53 - own they really just need someone to
01:55 - guide them through some content to read
01:57 - what their teacher would have read them
01:58 - in class again and again and again to
02:01 - help them solve a problem to help them
02:03 - work on a project if you have even the
02:05 - most basic skill in the area that this
02:07 - person needs to be tutored in you can
02:08 - definitely be valuable now i started
02:11 - tutoring when i was about 14 years old i
02:13 - actually was not tutoring in computer
02:15 - science i was tutoring in math and
02:17 - tutoring in just regular science in high
02:19 - school but you can definitely tutor in
02:21 - computer science and that's actually one
02:22 - of the more lucrative ways to make money
02:24 - when i started tutoring at 14 years old
02:26 - i was charging 20 an hour this is
02:28 - canadian dollars but still that was kind
02:31 - of the base rate you're not often going
02:33 - to see tutors that are charging less
02:34 - than twenty dollars per hour you have a
02:36 - one-on-one session with someone 20 an
02:38 - hour at least from where i am that's
02:40 - kind of a standard rate in other
02:41 - countries that may vary but still that's
02:43 - pretty good especially if you compare it
02:44 - to a minimum wage job which in canada is
02:46 - about 15 an hour now as you become a
02:49 - more skilled tutor you can charge fifty
02:51 - dollars an hour a hundred dollars an
02:53 - hour i've done tutoring sessions for two
02:54 - hundred dollars an hour before now i
02:56 - don't do that anymore because i do feel
02:58 - bad charging people that much money but
03:00 - it does have to be worth my time right
03:02 - so you get the idea here but this is
03:03 - definitely scalable and if you have a
03:05 - few clients you do a few tutoring
03:07 - sessions per week that can definitely
03:09 - add up so now i know the question is how
03:11 - do i find clients how do i actually find
03:13 - people to tutor now for me the best way
03:15 - to do this is to reach out to people in
03:17 - your community and to actually have a
03:19 - kind of personal connection with the
03:21 - people that you're tutoring now what i
03:23 - mean by that is to have someone maybe
03:25 - introduce you to a client or to market
03:27 - in your school which i guess is more
03:28 - difficult now with covid but still i'm
03:30 - going to talk to you about how i gained
03:32 - some clients so when i was 14 15 years
03:34 - old i guess i would have been in grade 9
03:36 - or grade 10 i was in a computer science
03:38 - class and there was a computer science
03:39 - class that happened kind of the year
03:41 - before me so in grade nine so what i did
03:43 - is i reached out to my computer science
03:45 - teacher and i said hey you know i'm a
03:47 - tutor i'm looking to tutor some people
03:49 - is there anyone you think could use a
03:51 - tutor in your class and then they'll go
03:53 - and do the work for you and recommend
03:55 - you assuming you're a good student to
03:57 - whoever it is that actually needs a
03:59 - tutor so from that i picked up about two
04:00 - or three clients and i was able to make
04:02 - about 60 a week when i was in grade 10
04:05 - tutoring people now i also tutored in
04:07 - other subjects like science math but
04:09 - computer science was kind of the main
04:11 - one that i did and that was obviously
04:12 - the one that i was most skilled at so
04:14 - it's not that difficult to get clients
04:16 - and if you can't do it in that way one
04:18 - great thing you can do is just post
04:19 - stuff at your school now i understand a
04:21 - lot of people are not actually in school
04:23 - right now so this is a bit of a flawed
04:24 - method but back then i would just post a
04:26 - sheet of paper with the kind of tabs
04:28 - where you can pull off and get my phone
04:29 - number and say hey i'm tutoring in
04:31 - computer science if you want an exam
04:33 - prep session if you want me to help you
04:34 - with the project or with your homework
04:36 - i'll tutor you that way other things you
04:38 - can do is list yourself on tutoring
04:40 - websites there's tons of them out there
04:42 - you can list yourself on fiverr as a
04:44 - tutor that's how i've gained a bunch of
04:45 - clients before and if you know friends
04:48 - and family that have maybe younger
04:49 - children that you can help out then you
04:51 - can ask if they need a tutor right
04:53 - almost all the clients that i've found
04:55 - have been from connections that i've had
04:57 - and have not required me being on the
04:58 - internet to actually find people now
05:00 - last thing i'll say here is that i
05:01 - understand a lot of people don't want a
05:03 - tutor or they're too nervous to do this
05:05 - all i'll say is that this is really a
05:07 - learning experience for you as the tutor
05:09 - as well and if you're only charging
05:10 - someone 15 20 25 an hour you don't have
05:14 - to be an amazing tutor you don't have to
05:15 - have a phd all you have to do is provide
05:18 - a little bit of value and you'll learn
05:19 - how to do that as you go through the
05:21 - different sessions the first time i
05:23 - tutored someone i was not very good at
05:24 - it as i did it more and more times it
05:26 - got better and better and slowly
05:28 - increased my rate as my skill increased
05:30 - anyways this is method number one i
05:32 - think this is really practical and
05:34 - almost all of you can do this don't make
05:36 - excuses go out there try to find some
05:38 - clients and make a little bit of money
05:39 - from tutoring alright so moving on to
05:41 - method number two now this one is a bit
05:44 - more challenging than the other methods
05:45 - i have on this list but it can be a lot
05:47 - more lucrative and in my opinion a lot
05:49 - more rewarding and fun now this is to
05:52 - build software or tools or websites for
05:54 - local businesses in your community now i
05:57 - think this is great because you're
05:58 - actually helping out a local business
06:00 - maybe a place that you've been to before
06:02 - and this is something that's really
06:04 - attainable because you're not trying to
06:05 - target the costcos or the walmarts or
06:08 - these huge stores that won't even answer
06:09 - your email you're actually targeting a
06:11 - client that you could drive to their
06:13 - store and kind of convince them verbally
06:15 - why they need your services or products
06:17 - now of course don't do this in a way
06:19 - where you're harassing anyone i'm going
06:20 - to explain the process i would go
06:22 - through here and what i've done in the
06:23 - past so the first thing i would do right
06:25 - now if i was about 15 years old and i
06:27 - had the skill to build a really basic
06:29 - single page website is i would look at
06:31 - all of the businesses in my local
06:33 - community and i would find if they have
06:34 - a website or not now most of them are
06:36 - going to have a website you may find a
06:38 - few that don't have one now if they
06:40 - don't have one i would actually
06:41 - physically drive to their store if i had
06:43 - a car maybe i would get my parents to
06:45 - drive me i would walk their bus or
06:46 - whatever the way is that i could get
06:47 - there and i would ask them and say hey
06:49 - do you guys want a website if you don't
06:51 - want one these are all the reasons i
06:53 - think you should have one i could do one
06:54 - for you for 50 bucks 75 bucks whatever
06:57 - the rate is you feel comfortable
06:58 - charging and the reason why you're going
07:00 - to make your money back from this is
07:01 - because you only need 10 clients to walk
07:03 - through your door from this website to
07:06 - make all of that money back right this
07:07 - website is here forever i'll deal with
07:09 - hosting it i'll deal with putting all
07:10 - this stuff up you can of course charge
07:12 - them for those extra costs but it's
07:14 - really easy to prove to someone why a
07:16 - website would actually affect the bottom
07:18 - line of the business and how they would
07:20 - make money back from it now of course
07:22 - most businesses do have websites so
07:23 - maybe that's not going to work out very
07:25 - well for you another thing you could do
07:26 - is offer to redesign a website if it's
07:28 - really poorly done if it looks like it's
07:30 - from the 1990s or what you could do is
07:33 - offer to build some type of automation
07:35 - tool for companies now this is going to
07:37 - be easier if you're actually involved in
07:39 - the company already or you have some
07:41 - insider information about them but
07:43 - something i've done is in the past is
07:44 - when i was working at a summer camp i
07:46 - realized that the staff that were in the
07:48 - main office of the summer camp were
07:50 - automatically generating schedules for
07:53 - the uh the next week and they were going
07:55 - through and manually trying to find any
07:57 - conflicts and make sure there wasn't two
07:59 - groups of kids that were participating
08:01 - in the same activity at the same time
08:03 - it was essentially a really basic
08:05 - algorithm problem to generate a schedule
08:07 - that they were doing by hand it was
08:08 - taking them like three four hours every
08:10 - week so i noticed they were doing this
08:13 - and i said hey do you guys want me to
08:14 - build you a really basic software tool
08:16 - that does this
08:17 - and they said yeah that would be awesome
08:20 - that would be great and that would save
08:21 - us tons of time so i built that tool i
08:23 - charged the company to build that made
08:25 - some money while being able to help out
08:27 - the company and you know that affected
08:28 - their bottom line because if they can
08:30 - save four eight 12 hours over the course
08:32 - of a summer doing the automated
08:34 - scheduling then my 100 charge or
08:36 - whatever it was for that software is
08:38 - well worth it because they don't have to
08:39 - pay employees to be doing something that
08:41 - the computer can do so this here is
08:43 - really all about providing value to
08:45 - someone and proving to them why whatever
08:47 - you charge them they're going to make
08:49 - back from whatever the solution is that
08:51 - you implement so you have to be creative
08:53 - this does involve you know a little bit
08:54 - of entrepreneurship and kind of getting
08:56 - out of your comfort zone but this is
08:57 - something i would highly recommend to
08:59 - anyone especially if you're kind of in
09:00 - the high school level because you have
09:02 - the skill to build something that's
09:04 - really simple but actually will help a
09:06 - business and automation tools time
09:08 - tracking tools maybe something that
09:10 - tracks orders or gives kind of a
09:12 - database of what's going on that's
09:14 - really really helpful and really simple
09:16 - to build and you can make a lot of money
09:18 - from so hopefully this makes sense
09:20 - hopefully i gave you some decent ideas
09:21 - in this section again i know this isn't
09:23 - the easiest thing in the world but i
09:24 - think this is really practical and this
09:26 - is something i've done in the past and
09:28 - found some success with all right so now
09:30 - we're moving on to method three now this
09:32 - is my least favorite method on this list
09:34 - but it does still make some money and
09:36 - can be fairly lucrative depending on
09:38 - kind of how you position yourself in
09:40 - this market now this is freelancing now
09:43 - freelancing when it comes to coding is
09:45 - difficult if you don't have a very
09:46 - particular skill but i'm going to talk
09:48 - about some strategies here that can make
09:50 - it so you can increase the revenue
09:52 - you'll get from offering freelancing
09:54 - skills so if you're unfamiliar with
09:56 - freelancing essentially this is you post
09:58 - an ad on some type of website five or
10:00 - upwork whatever it may be and someone
10:02 - ideally finds that ad and then pays to
10:04 - complete some type of task the most
10:06 - common thing is like making a website
10:08 - for someone or making a discord bot or
10:10 - working on you know an api or whatever
10:12 - it is that people need done they'll go
10:14 - on these websites and they'll try to
10:16 - find essentially the cheapest person
10:17 - they can that's capable of completing a
10:19 - task now this is the issue with
10:21 - freelancing there's tons of people that
10:23 - are offering services for the most
10:25 - generic things right for the things that
10:27 - everyone needs done now there's a huge
10:28 - client base there there's also a huge
10:30 - amount of people that are offering
10:32 - services and that means it's pretty much
10:33 - a race to the bottom in terms of how
10:35 - much you're gonna have to charge for
10:36 - services it may realistically take you
10:39 - four or five hours to create something
10:41 - and you only can charge 25 or 30
10:44 - because people mostly from around the
10:45 - world are offering way cheaper rates to
10:48 - do the exact same thing so i do find it
10:50 - difficult to make a lot of money from
10:51 - freelancing but you can absolutely make
10:53 - money and the best way to increase the
10:55 - rate you would charge when you're
10:57 - offering freelancing services is to do
11:00 - something that is very very niche and
11:01 - specific with a super small client base
11:04 - but also a super small number of people
11:06 - offering services now this kind of goes
11:08 - in every facet of business
11:11 - but what i mean by this is picking some
11:13 - task that's super super specific that
11:15 - like you couldn't even really imagine
11:17 - someone would be looking for something
11:19 - that i did when i was offering
11:20 - freelancing services about probably
11:22 - three or four years ago was i actually
11:24 - was pretty much completing people's
11:26 - homework and projects which is against
11:28 - fiverr terms of services don't tell them
11:30 - i told you that anyways that's what i
11:32 - was doing and i was doing this
11:33 - specifically for pie game projects so
11:35 - the ad i put on fiverr was you know i
11:37 - will make a pie game game for you or
11:40 - something like that and what would
11:41 - happen is i would get people with
11:42 - homework that was due in like two days
11:44 - or three days or an assignment or a
11:46 - project or something like that and they
11:48 - would reach out to me with a high degree
11:49 - of urgency to complete something and
11:51 - because of that fact i could charge them
11:53 - two or three times what i would normally
11:55 - charge because they needed it to be done
11:57 - in like two days three days now at this
11:59 - point in time it was like me and three
12:01 - other people on the entire website that
12:02 - were offering this service now i did
12:04 - actually make a video on how i did this
12:06 - i'll put it up on the screen and link it
12:07 - in the description so since then there's
12:09 - been tons of people that have just
12:11 - copied my exact same ad and now we're
12:13 - offering all these fiverr services for
12:15 - pygame but you need to pick something
12:17 - that's super specific super niche and
12:19 - that you can charge a fair amount of
12:21 - money for because there's only a few
12:22 - people offering that service
12:24 - so hopefully that makes a bit of sense
12:26 - if i'm thinking off the top of my head
12:28 - of things that you could offer services
12:29 - for they would be like specific python
12:32 - modules or a specific library in
12:34 - javascript or something that you know
12:36 - just not a lot of people do and that you
12:38 - might not get a ton of clients for but
12:39 - when you do get clients they'll actually
12:41 - pay you a fair price so it's worth your
12:43 - time again you got to look into this you
12:45 - have to do your own research all of
12:47 - these things require effort i can't just
12:48 - make you 500 a week but these are three
12:51 - things that i have done in the past and
12:53 - have made me lots of money obviously
12:55 - it's helped that i've had an online
12:57 - presence and i've had a youtube channel
12:59 - that's increased my reach and the number
13:00 - of people that i can get for these
13:02 - different services but before i had any
13:04 - of that i was still doing these things
13:06 - and still able to make about 500 a month
13:09 - so lastly here i will add that for all
13:12 - of these different areas it is really
13:13 - helpful to have some type of social
13:15 - presence online a linkedin a twitter an
13:18 - instagram a youtube whatever it is that
13:19 - you want to make maybe a basic blog or a
13:22 - resume website is helpful and you may be
13:24 - surprised on how many clients you end up
13:26 - getting from these social channels even
13:28 - if you only have say 500 followers or
13:30 - something really small i was surprised
13:32 - when i was younger and i only had say a
13:34 - thousand subscribers on youtube how many
13:36 - people actually reached out to me and
13:38 - asked for assistance because it was
13:39 - realistic for them to do that and i
13:41 - actually had the time to spend and you
13:43 - know tutor someone for an hour that
13:45 - reached out to me from my youtube email
13:47 - now before we end the video i will
13:48 - mention that i do have a course it's
13:50 - called programming expert it's designed
13:52 - to bring you to a software engineering
