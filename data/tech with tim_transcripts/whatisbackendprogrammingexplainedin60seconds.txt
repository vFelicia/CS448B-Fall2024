00:00 - so the first term I have for you here is
00:02 - the server side slash the back end this
00:04 - really refers to the programs or
00:06 - operations that are running on the
00:08 - server or the remote machine so if I
00:10 - have say the back end of my website
00:12 - that's running on a remote server and
00:14 - this is responsible for handling HTTP
00:17 - requests which is the web request you
00:18 - send when you want to get the HTML of
00:20 - the page and so I hit the server it
00:22 - sends me the HTML and then my browser
00:25 - actually renders the HTML so the
00:27 - rendering of the HTML is happening on
00:29 - the front end or the client side but
00:31 - actually retrieving the HTML from the
00:33 - page while I'm getting that from the
00:35 - server that's running my website
