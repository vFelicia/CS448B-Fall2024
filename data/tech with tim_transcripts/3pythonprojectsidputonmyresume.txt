00:00 - I've built over 100 python projects but
00:03 - here are three that I would actually put
00:05 - on my resume but first let's understand
00:08 - the four key components that make a
00:10 - great resumé project number one is that
00:12 - it needs to be easy to understand no one
00:15 - cares about your resume projects if they
00:17 - don't understand what they are
00:19 - regardless of what you build you need to
00:20 - be able to summarize it really simply
00:22 - and in one sentence someone should
00:24 - understand exactly what it is and why
00:26 - you built it number two is that it needs
00:28 - to have a wow factor you need to build
00:31 - something unique that when someone reads
00:32 - the title they immediately go wow that's
00:35 - cool I want to know more about that if
00:37 - you're resume projects are actually
00:39 - going to help you out people need to
00:40 - look at them or at least ask you
00:42 - questions about them and that's why you
00:44 - need a wow factor now number three is
00:46 - that they have to have been built for a
00:48 - purpose the best resumé projects solve a
00:50 - real world problem and have a story
00:52 - behind them sure you can just build
00:54 - something to put on your resume but it's
00:56 - a lot better in an interview to actually
00:58 - explain why you need it to build this
01:00 - and the type of problem that you're
01:02 - solving even less impressive projects
01:04 - that have a really good backstory
01:05 - usually stand out quite a bit more and
01:08 - they make it a lot easier for you to
01:09 - explain them with passion during an
01:11 - interview and lastly number four is that
01:13 - you need to demonstrate the capabilities
01:15 - employers are looking for especially at
01:17 - the junior level employers want to know
01:19 - that you're capable of actually building
01:21 - something on your own and specifically
01:23 - using the tools Frameworks or languages
01:25 - that are listed in the job description
01:27 - that you'll be using on a day-to-day so
01:29 - so feel free to change up your resume
01:31 - and tailor the projects you're putting
01:33 - there to the specific role that you're
01:34 - applying for so now let's dive into the
01:37 - three python projects I would put on my
01:39 - resume and why after an important
01:41 - message now when you do start building
01:43 - out these programming projects you'll
01:45 - want to be working in an IDE and that's
01:47 - not just because idees make your life so
01:49 - much easier but because experience with
01:52 - them is actually something that a lot of
01:53 - jobs are looking for now look there's
01:55 - all kinds of basic code editors out
01:57 - there that you could be using but if you
01:59 - want to get the professional level you
02:01 - should really utilize Jeet brains idees
02:03 - which is the sponsor of this video
02:06 - whether you're working in Python go rust
02:09 - Java you name it Jeet brains has a fully
02:11 - featured professional IDE for you these
02:14 - idees offer the best performance and
02:16 - speed and have impressive user
02:18 - interfaces take advantage of integrated
02:20 - debuggers code analysis quick fixes and
02:23 - incredible AI assistance that
02:25 - supercharge your workflow not to mention
02:27 - features like instant search and
02:29 - navigation and an insane amount of
02:31 - plugins to customize your environment
02:33 - now as you scale up and work on larger
02:35 - and larger projects the importance of an
02:37 - IDE becomes clear and can have a massive
02:39 - impact on your performance and
02:41 - efficiency you should really start
02:43 - building strong habits Now by working
02:45 - with professional jet brains idees by
02:47 - clicking the link in the description and
02:49 - taking advantage of these powerful tools
02:51 - so when we're selecting projects for our
02:53 - resume we want to choose a variety of
02:55 - different projects that showcase our
02:57 - knowledge across the different fields
02:59 - and skills that the employer is looking
03:01 - for and for a python related position
03:04 - usually this will be within something
03:05 - like web development or machine learning
03:07 - or automation so make sure you select
03:09 - the specific projects that really fit
03:11 - the role but if you're just doing a
03:13 - general resume showcasing your python
03:15 - skills you may want to have a few
03:17 - projects that cover those different
03:19 - areas so that's exactly what I would do
03:21 - and why I've selected these three
03:22 - projects I have one project that's a web
03:25 - development project another one that's
03:26 - more Ai and machine learning and then
03:28 - one that's more AUD and showcases that I
03:31 - can combine python with different
03:33 - languages so keep that in mind and let's
03:34 - roll into project number one here which
03:37 - is a Django website now this website
03:39 - right here fits the criteria I listed
03:41 - before it was actually built for a
03:43 - purpose and this purpose was to
03:44 - facilitate something called a code jam
03:47 - now a code Jam was a monthly coding
03:48 - competition I ran a while ago and this
03:50 - was actually a community project that a
03:52 - lot of people built now full disclosure
03:54 - here I did not build this entire website
03:57 - and if I did put it on my resume I would
03:58 - need to mention this specific
04:00 - contributions that I made as this was a
04:02 - community project but it makes such a
04:04 - great project for a resume which is why
04:05 - I'm showing it to you so first of all in
04:07 - order to use this site you need to sign
04:09 - in with GitHub so immediately that
04:11 - demonstrates that we know how to
04:12 - interact with an API and kind of bring
04:14 - an integration into our site now this
04:16 - entire site is built with Jango it's a
04:18 - whole python backend then obviously we
04:20 - have some HTML and JavaScript styling
04:22 - showing that we know some other
04:24 - languages as well so we have a nice
04:26 - landing page here you can see we can
04:27 - join the Discord server or we can view
04:29 - the current timoon so if I view the
04:31 - current timoon this is a competition
04:33 - that was happening this was about a year
04:34 - ago that it was going on and we have
04:36 - different roles so notice here that I'm
04:38 - kind of an admin user so I have the
04:39 - ability to end the timoon start team
04:42 - creation start submission start voting
04:44 - the different phases of the competition
04:46 - I can view the different submissions
04:48 - here so if I go here I can view all of
04:49 - them from the different teams that
04:51 - enrolled let's go back and I have the
04:53 - ability to judge as well so we can go
04:55 - here and we can view all the comments
04:57 - from the judges we can view the
04:58 - different categories and you can see
05:00 - this actually a pretty sophisticated
05:02 - website and the team that built this put
05:04 - quite a bit of work into this so as an
05:05 - individual this would take a long time
05:07 - to build but I think it's a really
05:08 - really great project that demonstrates
05:10 - so many different skills and again is
05:12 - really built for a real purpose and
05:13 - allows you to talk about why you need it
05:15 - to make this now let's go back to the
05:17 - homepage here you can see that we can
05:19 - view the timoon history and we can see
05:21 - who won in the previous timoon so we
05:23 - have these winners we can view all of
05:25 - their different projects we can go to
05:27 - something like unreleased there's no
05:29 - unreleased challenges so there's nothing
05:30 - there and then we can view things like
05:32 - the rules Etc there's a lot of other
05:34 - features here and depending on what type
05:36 - of user you're signed in as you'll have
05:38 - different permissions on the site but
05:40 - the reason I really love this project is
05:42 - because it takes all four of those boxes
05:44 - I talked about before it's Unique it has
05:47 - that wow factor it's easy to understand
05:49 - it's for grading a custom coding
05:51 - competition it's something that was
05:52 - built for a real purpose that has a
05:54 - story behind it and that's interesting
05:56 - to tell in an interview and it
05:57 - definitely demonstrates a lot of
05:59 - different capabilities at minimum
06:01 - building an entire site with Django but
06:03 - also user management interacting with
06:05 - different apis having some JavaScript
06:07 - and some HTML and it's sufficiently
06:09 - complex that if someone saw this on a
06:11 - resume and you were able to explain it
06:13 - to them they' know that you know Python
06:15 - and specifically know the D Jango
06:17 - framework now again I didn't build this
06:18 - entirely by myself but I could have if I
06:20 - wanted to and if I had done that I would
06:22 - definitely put this on my resume and it
06:24 - would be a great project that I could
06:26 - talk a lot about in an interview so the
06:28 - next project we're looking at is one of
06:30 - my all-time favorites and this is an AI
06:32 - learning how to play the game of Flappy
06:34 - Bird now this is great because not only
06:36 - did I code out the AI but I also coded
06:38 - out the game of Flappy Bird now as I
06:40 - said before we want to pick projects
06:42 - that kind of fit different categories
06:44 - based on the role that we're applying to
06:46 - so this one would be more for an AI or
06:48 - machine learning type position and could
06:49 - maybe even fit into data science as well
06:52 - although it's a little bit different
06:53 - than that anyways let's run the code
06:55 - here and I'll kind of explain to you how
06:56 - this works and why I love this project
06:58 - so this uses something called neuro
07:00 - evolution of augmented topologies
07:02 - otherwise known as neat now this is an
07:05 - evolutionary algorithm that trains in AI
07:07 - how to play a game through multiple
07:09 - different iterations and generations in
07:12 - this case we have about 50 birds in one
07:14 - generation it then takes the best
07:15 - performing birds from that generation
07:17 - kind of breeds them together and
07:19 - combines some of their parameters and
07:21 - eventually we end up with a bird that
07:23 - can go through the different pipes so
07:24 - the reason I really love this project is
07:26 - it's visual it's easy to understand it
07:29 - has that that wow factor because someone
07:30 - wants to ask hey how did you do that how
07:32 - did you train an AI how to play Flappy
07:34 - Bird we built it for a purpose because
07:36 - we wanted to actually do something
07:37 - related to machine learning and AI we
07:39 - wanted to maybe complete Flappy Bird
07:41 - maybe it's one of our favorite games we
07:42 - can come up with a decent story on why
07:44 - we wanted to build this and then we
07:47 - actually have the Showcase of our
07:48 - capabilities building an AI is not
07:50 - simple especially using something like
07:52 - neat it's a more advanced technique and
07:54 - algorithm and we can explain to the
07:56 - interviewer how it works right it's an
07:58 - interesting story we can showcase our
08:00 - knowledge of AI and machine learning by
08:02 - explaining how the neat algorithm
08:03 - operates and I just think it makes a
08:05 - really really great project and everyone
08:07 - that I've showed this to has really
08:08 - enjoyed it even if they're a
08:09 - non-programmer so hopefully you're
08:11 - getting the idea here things that are
08:13 - visual things that are easy to
08:14 - understand that are sufficiently complex
08:17 - that's what we're going for here and all
08:18 - the projects I've showed you so far
08:20 - immediately you can see the value from
08:22 - them and you can see how we could craft
08:24 - a really great story and really
08:26 - demonstrate our skills in an interview a
08:28 - project is not just there to be read
08:30 - it's there to be explained and
08:31 - elaborated on and you can really use
08:33 - that to your advantage when you're
08:35 - actually in an interview you can point
08:36 - to those different projects and say
08:38 - because of this project I did this this
08:39 - and this that's why you should consider
08:41 - me for this role so the last project I
08:43 - have for you Falls more into the
08:44 - automation category and it has a really
08:47 - strong purpose because it's something a
08:48 - lot of businesses actually legitimately
08:51 - need it's showing that you can build
08:52 - something that does solve a real world
08:54 - problem and does have real world value
08:57 - anyways let's get into it here and I'll
08:58 - quickly talk about kind kind of how it
08:59 - works then run you through the code a
09:01 - little bit so this project uses a
09:03 - combination of python specifically it
09:05 - uses flask for a backend API and then it
09:08 - uses react and JavaScript on the front
09:10 - end to actually render out and kind of
09:12 - visualize the website now this
09:14 - demonstrates you know how to use python
09:16 - in its correct purpose more for backend
09:18 - type languages and how to combine it
09:20 - with other languages which is a good
09:21 - skill and shows that you know more than
09:23 - simply just python so what we can do
09:25 - here with this is we can actually track
09:28 - the price of different products across
09:30 - amazon.com Now what I could do is I
09:32 - could type in a product here maybe I
09:34 - want to track the prices of soap or
09:35 - something and then I can start this web
09:37 - scraper and what this does is go to
09:39 - Amazon scrape all the products that
09:42 - match this filter in this case it's soap
09:44 - and then it will return a list to us and
09:46 - store them in a database so it's a
09:48 - multi-step process some of it's handled
09:50 - by python some of it's handled by the
09:52 - front end and it makes a really good
09:53 - project there's a lot of stuff that you
09:55 - can explain and it's fairly complex yet
09:57 - it's easy to understand just the
09:59 - implementation is complicated so if I
10:01 - scroll down here you can see that for
10:03 - something like an RTX 4080 it's showing
10:05 - me the last price I scraped this on
10:07 - March 3rd that was the last time and
10:09 - then any price change in this case if I
10:11 - look at this one we can see that there's
10:13 - been a bunch of price changes here and
10:14 - it's tracking all of those different
10:16 - changes for this specific Tower so kind
10:18 - of an interesting tool and you can see
10:20 - how businesses could use this in the
10:21 - e-commerce space a lot of these don't
10:23 - have any price changes that's fine you
10:25 - can see that it just shows you the
10:26 - actual Tower right here now if I click
10:28 - on something else like my ddr5 Ram same
10:31 - thing we can see any of the different
10:32 - price changes we can view ddr5 Ram we
10:35 - can view the product on Amazon or in
10:37 - this case this one was on NewEgg because
10:39 - it does it on multiple different sites
10:41 - and now let me quickly explain to you
10:42 - how this actually operates so you can
10:44 - see the python component for it so in my
10:46 - code here you can see that I have a back
10:48 - end a front end and then a tool that
10:50 - actually runs this on a schedule this
10:52 - uses python as well just to
10:53 - automatically send a request to the
10:55 - backend API to actually initiate the
10:58 - scraping now this this is a little bit
10:59 - complicated to explain in a minute or
11:01 - two I'm going to try to go really
11:02 - quickly you can see that I have a flask
11:04 - API setup here and what this will do is
11:06 - actually go to amazon.com it uses
11:09 - something called bright data we don't
11:10 - need to talk about that here that does
11:12 - some automated web scraping gets the
11:14 - results back to the API and then it
11:16 - saves that in a database and then
11:18 - Returns the results to the front end so
11:20 - it's doing two things right it's
11:21 - actually initiating the different
11:22 - scraping going to the site grabbing
11:24 - those different products storing them in
11:26 - a database and it's also communicating
11:28 - with the front end giving the data that
11:30 - the front end needs so it's showing that
11:32 - we know how to separate out different
11:33 - concerns how we handle the data on the
11:35 - back end and then push that to the front
11:36 - end how we interact with the database
11:38 - and how we write a flask API so you can
11:41 - see that I have some database models
11:42 - here right for a product result for my
11:44 - tracked product because there's some
11:46 - products that you can actually track and
11:47 - they'll automatically be scraped every
11:49 - day every hour whatever time period you
11:51 - want we have a few different endpoints
11:53 - that we've written here this one is to
11:55 - get the different results so we're
11:56 - posting the results to this endpoint
11:58 - when they're received there's a bunch of
11:59 - other stuff that goes on here I actually
12:01 - have an entire video walking through
12:02 - this project that I will link on screen
12:05 - the idea is it's a pretty complicated
12:07 - back end there's a lot of stuff going on
12:09 - we have something for the API we have
12:10 - something for the web scraper you can
12:12 - see there's a bunch of code here that
12:13 - actually does the web scraping itself
12:15 - we're communicating with different
12:16 - endpoints using a rest API and then we
12:18 - have a front end that's displaying all
12:20 - of that information so having that on a
12:22 - resume and being able to walk through
12:24 - that very clearly in an interview is
12:25 - going to show you really know what
12:27 - you're doing you know how to build a
12:28 - large Pro project you know how to solve
12:30 - different problems you know how to
12:31 - connect different components together
12:33 - which is what a lot of companies are
12:35 - looking for so with all that said let's
12:36 - wrap up by going through a few key tips
12:38 - you want to keep in mind when you're
12:40 - actually determining your resumé
12:42 - projects first of all when you're
12:44 - building a resumé project always try to
12:46 - build something that has a good story
12:48 - has a good reason behind it something
12:50 - that you can actually point to and say
12:51 - hey the reason I needed this project was
12:54 - because this issue that I faced that's
12:56 - what you do as a software engineer you
12:57 - solve problems and you build products
12:59 - that help everyday people so being able
13:02 - to explain that how you went from the
13:04 - problem to the solution and the
13:05 - different design decisions that you made
13:07 - is really important and stands out a lot
13:09 - more than purely the complexity of your
13:12 - project it's also really important to
13:14 - make sure that your project stand out
13:16 - they have that wow factor and that
13:17 - people actually want to look at them if
13:19 - you build the same thing that everyone
13:21 - else has built an employer or a
13:23 - recruiter is not even going to click on
13:24 - the link they're not even going to check
13:25 - it out so make sure you're building
13:27 - something that's exciting that people
13:28 - actually want to look at and that
13:30 - they're going to ask you questions about
13:32 - a lot of recruiters won't actually look
13:33 - at your projects before an interview
13:35 - what they're going to do is ask you
13:37 - questions about them if they do
13:38 - eventually decide to bring you in if you
13:40 - had a really really impressive project
13:42 - they might check it out briefly that
13:44 - could be the reason that they actually
13:45 - invite you for an interview because they
13:47 - want to learn more about it and you
13:48 - stood out compared to a lot of other
13:50 - people I know that I've had that happen
13:52 - to me people have seen some of the
13:53 - projects and accomplishments that I had
13:55 - on my resume and invited me purely
13:57 - because they were interested in that
13:59 - didn't necessarily think they were going
14:00 - to give me a job they said hey this guy
14:02 - looks a little bit different than all
14:03 - these other candidates let's invite him
14:05 - in let's see what he's about so just
14:06 - another way to make yourself Stand Out
14:08 - have that wow factor make sure people
14:10 - can understand what it is and also make
14:12 - sure if possible it's easy for someone
14:14 - to actually view the project if it's a
14:16 - simple website URL that's the best they
14:18 - can just click on it it opens up if it
14:20 - requires a bunch of install steps and
14:22 - they have to set it up on their local
14:24 - computer people just aren't going to do
14:25 - that they're lazy right so the more
14:27 - Visual and easier you can make it for
14:29 - someone to access your project the
14:30 - better it's going to be and the higher
14:32 - chance they're actually going to look at
14:33 - it so with that said guys that's going
14:35 - to wrap up this video If you enjoyed
14:37 - make sure to leave a like subscribe to
14:38 - the channel and I will see you in the
14:40 - next one
