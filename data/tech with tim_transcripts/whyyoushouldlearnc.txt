00:00 - so moving on to my second recommendation
00:02 - this is something very different from
00:03 - Python and this is C plus plus now C
00:06 - plus plus is objectively a very powerful
00:08 - programming language it has really
00:10 - unlimited use cases you want to make a
00:12 - triple A game yeah you can do that with
00:13 - C plus want to make a website you can do
00:15 - that want to make a compiler you can do
00:17 - that now with that said I will warn you
00:18 - it is more challenging this isn't
00:20 - something that is as beginner friendly I
00:22 - wouldn't recommend most people start
00:24 - learning C plus as their first
00:25 - programming language and this is
00:27 - something that's going to take longer to
00:28 - learn and get good at if you're someone
00:29 - who just wants to learn a ton of new
00:31 - stuff you want to dive into something
00:32 - completely different then I would
00:34 - recommend C plus
