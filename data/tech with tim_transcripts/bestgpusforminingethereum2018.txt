00:00 - hey guys welcome back to another youtube
00:03 - video in today's video i'm gonna be
00:04 - talking about mining and the best
00:06 - graphics cards to use for mining
00:08 - aetherium so aetherium you can see right
00:11 - here we've got a price of 310 u.s.
00:14 - dollars and this hasn't been the highest
00:17 - price aetherium is hot it's been if I go
00:19 - to the one-year mark here we can look at
00:21 - the graph and we've seen it skyrocketed
00:23 - up to almost 400 at some points and now
00:25 - we're just balancing out at about 300 so
00:28 - aetherium is definitely still here in
00:30 - the market place and there's a lot of
00:31 - people mining it and selling it so it's
00:32 - a great time to get in and start mining
00:35 - so that being said I'm just gonna be
00:38 - reviewing the performance versus the
00:41 - cost of some of the graphics cards on
00:43 - the market where the best graphics cards
00:45 - in my opinion on the market so let's get
00:47 - started right away just talking about
00:49 - the gtx 1070 so I've got this Amazon
00:52 - link up right here and you can see
00:55 - immediately the price well the stock
00:57 - price is six hundred ten dollars
00:58 - Canadian but right now it's on sale for
01:01 - five hundred sixty four dollars so the
01:03 - hash rate on this gtx 1070 is about
01:07 - twenty-seven mega hashes stalk again
01:10 - this really depends on what model of
01:13 - card you get some of them you're gonna
01:15 - get lower you're gonna get twenty four
01:16 - twenty five some of them you're gonna
01:18 - get much higher you might even get to
01:20 - twenty nine and this is again just the
01:21 - stalk so if you were to overclock this
01:25 - card you could get a lot more
01:26 - performance out of it
01:28 - so personally I do recommend this card
01:30 - as it is a pretty hefty price but not
01:33 - compared to the the next cards that
01:35 - we're going to talk about so for example
01:36 - the 1080 Ti and this one will definitely
01:39 - get the job done and it is overclockable
01:41 - obviously as all graphics cards are and
01:43 - you can get about twenty seven mega hash
01:45 - stock so you can probably get it up to
01:47 - about thirty buy overclocking alright so
01:50 - let's get down to the next one now so
01:52 - now we're going to talk about the gtx
01:54 - ten atti
01:55 - so immediately we can see a huge price
01:58 - difference here almost double the price
01:59 - so again right now it's on sale but
02:02 - usually it costs eleven hundred dollars
02:04 - now the question here is is it worth it
02:07 - so the stock make a hash per second on
02:12 - this card is
02:13 - actually about 30 to make a hash per
02:15 - second again obviously depends on what
02:18 - company you're getting it from and if
02:21 - you get lucky with the card some card
02:23 - some different companies can just range
02:25 - by mega hashes just by the way that
02:27 - they're built in the quality so you're
02:29 - gonna get about thirty to stock again
02:32 - overclocking you can probably bump this
02:33 - up to about thirty seven I've seen some
02:36 - people getting thirty eight out of it
02:37 - which is pretty amazing so is it worth
02:40 - your money well yes or no so it's an
02:43 - extra $500 $600 and you're only getting
02:48 - about at max ten mega hash per second
02:52 - more and that's if you overclock it
02:53 - versus the gtx 1070 so i'll let you be
02:56 - the judge of that but personally I
02:58 - wouldn't get these cards remaining as
03:00 - they have a huge capital startup cost
03:02 - and especially if you're not a huge
03:04 - miner and you're only gonna have two or
03:05 - three cards in your rig this one is kind
03:08 - of too expensive and it does draw a ton
03:11 - of electricity too especially this model
03:13 - with the three fans so I would probably
03:15 - go with a ten seventy in this case okay
03:18 - so now that we've gone through the top
03:20 - two Nvidia cards let's go over to AMD so
03:23 - we're gonna start talking about the 480
03:25 - so the RX 480 is not as good as the
03:28 - other cards I've talked about but for
03:30 - the price it gets the job done so a
03:33 - stock mega hash for this card is about
03:35 - between 22 and 24 mega hash per second
03:38 - now with these AMD cards you can
03:40 - actually modify the BIOS to get a lot
03:43 - more performance out of these cards and
03:44 - again you can obviously overclock them
03:46 - and get them up to about maybe 28 29
03:48 - mega hash per second so personally I own
03:50 - one of these cards and it hashes for me
03:52 - at stock at about 23 mega hash per
03:55 - second and with overclocking I can bump
03:57 - it up to about 27 and again this one is
04:00 - used for 375 they're very hard to come
04:03 - by right now you can't really find too
04:05 - many new ones for a decent price
04:08 - I'd say new for this card is maybe
04:10 - around $500 if you can find it but you
04:13 - can also pick up a bunch of them on eBay
04:14 - and Newegg as well they have some Rx for
04:17 - eighties as well so now let's move on to
04:19 - the rx 5 II okay so as this is a model
04:23 - higher than the RX 480
04:25 - you would assume it is a lot better
04:27 - well as it does get better mega hashes
04:30 - so it gets between 25 and 26 mega hash
04:32 - per second on stock there is an issue
04:34 - with this card that has been noticed so
04:36 - when you're mining aetherium there's
04:39 - something called the e posh so right now
04:41 - I believe we're on about 144 143 but as
04:45 - time goes on this card has continually
04:48 - gone down in performance so back in one
04:50 - at the 130 posh this card was getting
04:54 - about 30 mega hash per second and
04:55 - currently it's getting about 25 to 26 on
04:59 - stock so that's something to look at
05:01 - with this card when you're mining with
05:04 - it as time goes on the performance is
05:05 - gonna get worse now if we look at the
05:08 - price here it's cheaper than all of the
05:10 - other cards so is it worth it to get
05:13 - this card well if you're just starting
05:16 - up mining this isn't a bad card to get
05:18 - and you if you find out that you want to
05:21 - get better cards later on you could
05:22 - always sell this one and invest into a
05:24 - newer card maybe a 1070 or an Rx for 80
05:28 - even though this one does hash more as
05:30 - time goes on again like I've said the
05:32 - performance is going to go down okay so
05:35 - now it's time for me to kind of rank
05:37 - which ones I think are the best in which
05:39 - one I would personally recommend so like
05:42 - I said before I have an Rx for 80 that's
05:44 - just because I got a really good deal on
05:45 - it
05:46 - buying it used but personally I would
05:49 - probably recommend the 1070 and this is
05:52 - just because of the performance pretty
05:56 - much and because of the cost so like I
05:58 - said we gets talked about 27 when you're
06:01 - overclocking you can probably get up to
06:03 - 30 even higher than that and right now
06:05 - in Canadian dollars the price is 564
06:09 - dollars which is pretty expensive but
06:11 - compared to the 1080 is a much more
06:14 - reasonable price so getting a rig with
06:16 - six of these cards or five of these
06:18 - cards you can be making quite a bit of
06:21 - money per month and per year and
06:22 - definitely making you return back on
06:24 - this card
06:25 - whereas we go to the 1080 here we're
06:28 - only getting about three or four maybe
06:30 - even five making a hash per second more
06:32 - but for an extra four hundred five
06:34 - hundred dollars and in my opinion that's
06:36 - not really worth it especially if you're
06:38 - just starting out mine
06:40 - because you're putting a ton of capital
06:41 - up and we don't really know exactly
06:43 - where the markets gonna go with
06:44 - aetherium and if this card is gonna be
06:47 - able to sustain this super high mega
06:49 - hash as The Epoch go on so there you
06:52 - have it I've shaved kind of a quick
06:53 - review here of the top four cards
06:55 - remaining so we can go through it one
06:56 - more time we have the 580 D 480 the GTX
07:01 - 1080 Ti and then the gtx 1070 and this
07:05 - is the one that i would recommend if
07:07 - you're looking to purchase any of these
07:08 - cards i do have the link to all of these
07:11 - down in the description go ahead and
07:13 - click on that to load up Amazon and
07:15 - other than that have a nice night if you
