00:00 - python is very flexible when it comes to
00:02 - web development but I'm going to
00:04 - recommend here that you make something
00:05 - like a social media Clump so something
00:07 - like Instagram Twitter Facebook YouTube
00:10 - you're not going to build a full
00:11 - Instagram app or a full Twitter you're
00:14 - going to build kind of the core features
00:15 - where users can sign in and sign out
00:18 - they can post something maybe they can
00:20 - search for different users and look at a
00:21 - profile they can like and they can
00:23 - comment that alone is a ton of different
00:25 - features and even if you just build a
00:27 - really Bare Bones version it's pretty
00:29 - impressive now the reason it's
00:30 - impressive is because if you're making
00:32 - something like this you need to make not
00:33 - only a front end but a back end as well
00:35 - you're gonna have to learn a lot to make
00:37 - this and it's going to look really good
00:38 - on a resume
