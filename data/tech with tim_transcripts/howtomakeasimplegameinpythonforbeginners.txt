00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:03 - YouTube video so I just want to start it
00:05 - off and apologize that I haven't been
00:07 - active for the last month or so um
00:09 - really there's not too many excuses I
00:11 - can make for myself other than I've been
00:13 - extremely busy and I really haven't
00:14 - found the motivation to sit down and
00:16 - make a video on my computer now I
00:18 - apologize to you guys I know a lot of
00:20 - you have been subscribed for a while and
00:21 - you've been waiting for new videos but
00:23 - I'm trying to get back into the flow of
00:24 - things now and I should be coming out
00:26 - with videos I'm hoping at least once a
00:28 - week so right now I've I'm sitting down
00:30 - and making a video and I'm making it on
00:33 - another Python tutorial now in this case
00:36 - I'm gonna be showing you how to make a
00:37 - really simple game now the reason I'm
00:40 - doing this is because on some my other
00:41 - Python videos I got a really a large
00:43 - amount of support I'm really thankful
00:44 - for that from you guys I've been getting
00:46 - a lot more reviews on them and a lot of
00:47 - you guys are really enjoying them so I
00:49 - figured I'd make some more now this one
00:50 - is directed more towards beginners
00:52 - people that are really just starting off
00:54 - with Python I'm not going into any
00:55 - graphics in this tree it's not going to
00:57 - be a GUI anything crazy like stuff I've
00:59 - done before she's gonna be a really
01:01 - simple text-based game that you can show
01:03 - your friends you can show your family
01:04 - and you can even maybe play by yourself
01:06 - now in this case I'm gonna be making a
01:09 - game it's gonna be kind of a quiz on
01:11 - myself so I'll show you quick example
01:13 - I've got one open here that I made
01:15 - earlier you can see hi welcome to the
01:18 - Tim quiz trotty has many questions
01:19 - direct as possible question one what is
01:22 - the name of my youtube channel so I'm
01:26 - gonna answer correctly if say tact with
01:27 - Tim like so it gives us a little
01:30 - feedback says correct what is my H well
01:33 - you guys should know I'm 17 put 17 in
01:36 - there what is my favorite sport
01:38 - now I'm gonna answer this one
01:39 - incorrectly I will tell you what it is
01:40 - after obviously um what is my favorite
01:43 - sport I'm gonna do let's say um football
01:46 - like that incorrect what is my favorite
01:50 - food I'm just gonna say sushi that's
01:51 - incorrect as well alright so you can CSS
01:53 - thank you for playing you got two
01:55 - questions correct
01:56 - you got a 50% mark and it's it's nice to
01:58 - you passed barely but we still did pass
02:00 - and that is a really simple game and
02:04 - that's gonna be something that I'm gonna
02:05 - be showing you guys how to make right
02:06 - now so first thing we want to do is if
02:08 - we don't really have pipe on installed
02:10 - go ahead and do that to do
02:12 - I just go Python on Google he'll bring
02:16 - you up on the website here python.org
02:18 - downloads download Python three point
02:20 - six point five really straightforward
02:22 - really simple do that once it's
02:24 - downloaded in your little search bar
02:26 - down here in window Zients click ideally
02:28 - so just type that in it's gonna pop up
02:30 - it'll give you a little console it looks
02:32 - something like this
02:33 - now you're gonna click file new file
02:35 - there you go your screen should now look
02:37 - like mine and you're ready to get run in
02:39 - with Python so I did that quickly but
02:41 - that's alright you guys should be able
02:42 - to follow along so I'm just gonna click
02:44 - ctrl s here I'm going to save this as a
02:46 - simple game too because I already did
02:48 - one earlier and let's just get started
02:51 - right away so what I want to do is I
02:54 - first want to start by kind of greeting
02:56 - our user so I want to say hello
02:59 - Calma welcome to and we just did a Tim
03:03 - quiz so maybe let's just do like trivia
03:06 - welcome to trivia like that all right
03:10 - and we'll say underneath here we're
03:14 - gonna do a new variable in this case you
03:15 - can say an S stands for answer I'm gonna
03:18 - put input I'm gonna explain this after
03:20 - just follow along right now just say are
03:23 - you ready to play like so I'm just gonna
03:29 - give the answer I'm expecting so either
03:31 - yes board no like that alright so we
03:36 - just start off with a really simple
03:37 - print statement if you guys don't
03:38 - understand any of this that I'm doing
03:40 - right now I do have some really basic PI
03:42 - game tutorials that you can go ahead and
03:43 - follow um they're just on my channel
03:46 - I'll leave a link to them up in the top
03:47 - right here and in the description down
03:49 - below it'll be in the form of a card if
03:51 - you want to click on it on the actual
03:52 - video right now if you guys are
03:54 - interested in more advanced tutorials
03:55 - this one's way too easy for you go ahead
03:57 - and check out my PI game tutorials it's
03:59 - how you make it graphical game in Python
04:01 - a little bit more advanced but it's more
04:03 - rewarding and you actually get to see
04:04 - some physical stuff on the screen again
04:06 - card right now link in the description
04:08 - down below ok so we say input and what
04:12 - this is gonna do is it's gonna allow the
04:13 - user to type in after this line either
04:16 - yes or no so I'm gonna put a cool in
04:17 - here so that gives them a little space
04:18 - to type are you ready to play yes or no
04:22 - just now I'm just gonna go a little if
04:24 - statement mistake
04:25 - aniss dot lower explain what that does
04:29 - again in a second equals equals yes
04:33 - we're ready to play we can go ahead and
04:35 - continue typing our stuff in here so
04:38 - what this little dot lower is that I put
04:40 - here is it's actually a string method
04:42 - and what it does is it turns all of our
04:44 - input into lowercase so right here
04:47 - whatever the user types is going to be
04:49 - stored in this variable ans and then for
04:53 - example if they were to type yes in all
04:55 - capitals and we were to compare just ans
04:58 - equals equals yes well it doesn't equal
05:00 - lowercase Y s equals uppercase yes so
05:02 - this is going to be false it's not going
05:04 - to let the user play so by putting it
05:06 - dot lower it changes that into lowercase
05:08 - letters so we can then compare it
05:09 - against this and make sure that we don't
05:11 - get people typing yes or maybe have a
05:14 - capital y at the beginning of yes and
05:16 - not being able to play so we'll get
05:19 - right into question one so in here I'm
05:21 - just gonna actually up top let's do this
05:23 - I'm going to find a new variable can I
05:24 - call it score and I set it equal to zero
05:26 - the save total underscore Q such is
05:30 - going to stand for total questions and
05:31 - in this case we're gonna do four just so
05:33 - doesn't take us too long obviously you
05:35 - guys can do a lot more if you want to do
05:36 - that just by following the format I'm
05:38 - about to show so now we're gonna ask the
05:40 - next question so we're gonna use ans
05:42 - again for answer we're going to say
05:43 - input then you here we're gonna say
05:45 - question one and what's a good question
05:47 - we can ask we can say what is the best
05:55 - programming language now obviously this
05:58 - is very subjective
05:59 - you can answer any language you want in
06:02 - here in this case I'm just gonna put
06:03 - Python just I can't really think of a
06:04 - good question right now but if you were
06:07 - to really do a trivia one you might want
06:08 - to do something that's more fact-based
06:09 - alright we're gonna say again if an s
06:12 - equals equals Python all right
06:17 - but we're forgetting something because
06:19 - someone might use a capital P for Python
06:21 - we want to put dot lower in front of
06:22 - here what we're gonna do is we're gonna
06:24 - add one to the score so score plus two
06:26 - plus one and then we're gonna go ahead
06:28 - and we're going to print correct so you
06:32 - don't have to tell them if they got it
06:34 - correct or not I like to do that just so
06:36 - they know which ones are getting wrong
06:38 - but if
06:39 - don't you want to make it kind of a bit
06:41 - harder for them to play again and again
06:42 - try to get perfect you don't have to
06:45 - tell them if they got it correct or not
06:46 - and you would just leave out the part
06:47 - that I'm about to type right now which
06:49 - says else print encourage like that so
06:54 - all you would do if they got it correct
06:55 - is you'd go score plus equals one and
06:57 - then you move on to the next question
06:58 - now for the next question it's really
07:00 - straightforward all I'm gonna do is copy
07:02 - this paste it down here and then I'm
07:06 - just going to change the question and
07:07 - the answer so question number two let's
07:10 - do maybe a more fact-based question
07:12 - let's say what is 2 plus 8 plus 9 minus
07:21 - 1 now who can do that the fastest all
07:23 - right
07:24 - so I know the answer the answer is 18 so
07:28 - we're gonna do that now the only thing
07:30 - is I don't want to put this dot lower
07:31 - method anymore because I'm assuming the
07:33 - person is gonna be typing numbers so
07:35 - there's no point in putting dot lower
07:36 - and the reason I'm putting quotes around
07:38 - my number here is because it at any time
07:40 - anyone inputs anything in here even if
07:42 - they type in for example 18 or like 187
07:45 - it's gonna come in as a string data type
07:48 - and I don't want to be checking number
07:51 - against string right so I'm just gonna
07:53 - keep it in quotations like this all
07:56 - right we're gonna go down again same
07:57 - process paste that down there
07:59 - question number 3 this time now for
08:02 - question number 3 let's change this up a
08:05 - little bit and we're gonna say hmm
08:10 - what's a good question we can put down
08:12 - here okay this one's good what is better
08:15 - a 1050 Ti or 1060 now these have to
08:22 - involve graphics card so I'm just gonna
08:23 - give a little thing in here just so
08:27 - people know that we're dealing with
08:28 - graphics cards it's not just some random
08:31 - thing so if you don't know the answer to
08:32 - that it's pretty basic but I'm just
08:35 - gonna put in here the answer is 1050 Ti
08:38 - and then again we just keep correct
08:41 - incorrect and we'll go ahead we'll do
08:44 - another one and this will be our last
08:45 - question just so you don't bore anyone
08:46 - too much number four and we'll say
08:51 - what should the question for number four
08:53 - be what's a good trivia question let's
08:57 - see here we'd say who came second in the
09:05 - Stanley Cup Finals believe that's how
09:09 - you spell Stanley Cup maybe not anyways
09:11 - in this case I'm just gonna give the
09:15 - option I'm just gonna put in here we're
09:17 - gonna say the Knights I think it was the
09:21 - Las Vegas Knights believe so and then
09:23 - people are able to type obviously they
09:26 - might not type Knights they might type
09:27 - something else but for the purpose of
09:28 - this tutorial I'm just gonna put Knights
09:30 - because that's the answer that I would
09:32 - type in here now if you wanted to for
09:35 - example give someone the option to be
09:36 - able to type two different answers and
09:38 - have that correct so maybe you wanted
09:42 - them to be able to type Knights or you
09:43 - want them to be able to type Las Vegas
09:45 - or Vegas the way that we would do that
09:47 - is we're just gonna copy this here I'm
09:49 - gonna put or I'm gonna put control V and
09:52 - say ants on lower equals in this case
09:54 - I'm gonna say in Vegas now what this
09:58 - allows us to do is it says if the answer
10:00 - is Knights or the answer is Vegas we're
10:03 - gonna say that's correct so if either
10:05 - one of those are typed typed in then
10:07 - that's the correct answer and you can do
10:09 - that for any of the things like this if
10:11 - you want it to go maybe three answers
10:12 - you would just continue or and then do
10:15 - the same process for whatever the other
10:17 - answer would be alright so now that
10:20 - we've done that I'm just gonna test this
10:21 - to make sure everything's working okay
10:22 - say are you ready to play type yes what
10:25 - is the best programming language we'll
10:27 - obviously we know that it's Python what
10:30 - is two plus eight plus nine minus one
10:32 - now in this case I'm just gonna type in
10:35 - the wrong answer let's say negative nine
10:37 - all right incorrect what is better a
10:40 - 1050 TI we're at 1060 that's graphics
10:43 - card so in this case 1016 incorrect oh
10:47 - it's because I put the wrong card in the
10:49 - answer slot don't worry I'll fix that in
10:51 - a second who came second in the Stanley
10:53 - Cup phones thanks there we go
10:56 - correct great so everything's working
10:58 - except this one just because I put the
11:00 - wrong answer instantly times 60 now
11:03 - that's all great but what I wanted
11:04 - is at the end of this program I want to
11:06 - print out how well they did in total so
11:09 - it's okay for four questions they
11:12 - probably know how many they got right
11:13 - and how many we got wrong if you had a
11:15 - lot of questions maybe like 20 questions
11:17 - then we want to give them kind of like a
11:19 - mark so anything I'm gonna say print
11:23 - thank you for playing and then we're
11:27 - gonna say comma actually come in here
11:30 - you guys and then little space a comma
11:34 - now which is outside of the quotes and
11:36 - this is we're gonna put our score so
11:38 - score and then questions correct just
11:44 - like that so thank you for playing
11:45 - you got score who's gonna be our score
11:48 - so like two three zero whatever
11:50 - questions correct period after this now
11:54 - I want to print out their mark so in
11:56 - order to figure out what their mark was
11:57 - the percent they got what we're gonna do
11:59 - is a really simple math calculation so
12:01 - I'll just say mark equal to and I'm
12:03 - gonna put brackets because we need to do
12:05 - a little bit of order of operations here
12:07 - we're gonna say score divided by total
12:10 - questions and then multiplied by just
12:15 - like that and then again I'm gonna print
12:17 - down here and they say print mark Paulo
12:23 - mark like that and then after this I'm
12:27 - gonna say print goodbye like that so
12:31 - let's go ahead and test this out hello
12:34 - welcome to trivia are you ready to play
12:35 - yes I am what is the best programming
12:38 - language Python correct what is 2 plus 8
12:41 - plus 9 minus 118 what is better 1050 TI
12:45 - or 1060 so I'm going to answer this run
12:47 - wrong and just put 1050 Ti and correct
12:49 - who came second in the Stanley Cup
12:51 - Finals
12:52 - we'll put D Knights although I just
12:55 - realized we need a k4 Knights I am okay
12:59 - at English guys don't worry all right so
13:00 - thank you for playing
13:01 - you got three questions correct and our
13:03 - mark was 75 goodbye now there's a few
13:07 - things I want to fix here obviously
13:08 - Knights needs okay like that sorry about
13:11 - that I'm sure a lot of you were
13:12 - screaming at the screen when you saw me
13:14 - type you like that and then we're also
13:15 - just gonna get rid of these spaces here
13:17 - so exercise
13:18 - you got and then questions because when
13:19 - we put the comma here it automatically
13:21 - is going to put a space before and after
13:23 - our variables so same thing with
13:24 - marketing get rid of the space and also
13:27 - I want to add the % so to do this
13:30 - without having a space there's a mark +
13:33 - and in this case we're now gonna have to
13:34 - put string for a mark and we're gonna
13:38 - add a percent sign like this and you'll
13:41 - see how that looks in just a second
13:43 - alright so let's go ahead and check this
13:46 - out one more time are you ready to play
13:48 - so I'm just going to show you happens if
13:49 - I click no if you say no I just says
13:51 - thank you for playing your questions
13:52 - correct mark zero percent goodbye
13:54 - obviously because your score is zero and
13:57 - then if we click at 5 and click yes say
14:00 - what is the best programming language
14:01 - this case we say Python what is the
14:04 - answer this 18 what is better in this
14:07 - case then we got wrong again 1050 Ti and
14:11 - Vegas correct thank you for playing you
14:13 - got three questions correct mark 75%
14:15 - goodbye now if you wanted to you could
14:18 - do a little final touch here so once I
14:20 - said no it's still at 1 ahead and said
14:22 - thanks for playing you got whatever if
14:25 - we don't want to say that all we have to
14:26 - do is highlight all this just click tab
14:28 - because now we're indented into this
14:31 - little if statement here so if we said
14:33 - no it's just gonna end the program right
14:35 - away it's not gonna bother I'm saying
14:37 - the rest of the stuff although we might
14:39 - still want to say goodbye so if we
14:40 - uninvent goodbye what happens here is
14:43 - once we get through this if statement so
14:45 - after we've done all this it's gonna say
14:47 - goodbye if we don't ever end up getting
14:49 - inside of this if statement because well
14:51 - it wasn't yes then it's just gonna print
14:54 - a goodbye like that all right so that's
14:56 - pretty much been it for this video just
14:59 - been a really simple explanation and
15:01 - kind of tutorial on how to make a really
15:02 - simple game text-based obviously you
15:04 - guys should be a lot more creative than
15:06 - I am and come up with some good
15:07 - questions stuff that'll actually be
15:08 - entertaining to play you can do a quiz
15:11 - about yourself you do something like
15:12 - this and it's a really neat way to kind
15:14 - of start learning how to program and
15:16 - it's a cool game you could show your
15:17 - parents you could show your friends and
15:19 - test how well they know you or test how
15:21 - well they know a certain topic or
15:22 - something like that so if you guys
15:23 - enjoyed the video please make sure you
15:25 - leave a like and subscribe I'm planning
15:27 - on doing more videos like this so if you
