00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:10 - youtube video so in today's video i'm
00:12 - going to be going through everything
00:14 - that i have learned over the past 10
00:16 - years of programming now i started to
00:18 - program back in 2011 when i was only 11
00:22 - years old obviously not doing anything
00:24 - very complicated but this is kind of
00:26 - where my journey began and you're gonna
00:28 - see this has been a long journey with
00:29 - lots of difficulties and it makes a very
00:31 - interesting story anyways hopefully as i
00:34 - go through this video i'll give you kind
00:35 - of a curriculum or outline of things you
00:37 - may want to learn however if you are new
00:40 - to programming or looking to upgrade
00:41 - your skills you should check out
00:44 - programmingexpert.io from the link in
00:46 - the description this is a brand new
00:47 - course that i have just released with
00:49 - the algo expert team we've been working
00:51 - on this for like six months it has a ton
00:53 - of awesome content and it gives you a
00:55 - complete structure and guide on one page
00:58 - of pretty much everything you need to
01:00 - know to master program any support you
01:02 - guys could provide would be awesome i'm
01:04 - super passionate about this and again if
01:06 - you guys are new to programming or just
01:08 - trying to get better definitely check
01:10 - this out programming expert dot io
01:12 - anyways with that said let's go back to
01:14 - 2011 and i will tell you what i remember
01:17 - back then when i was learning how to
01:18 - code all right so the details in the
01:20 - first few years here might be slightly
01:22 - inaccurate because my memory is not that
01:24 - good but i do know that back in 2011
01:27 - this is kind of when i started to
01:28 - realize that i wanted to get into some
01:30 - type of stem related field i really
01:33 - hated art i hated anything creative i
01:35 - hated music and english and all of that
01:37 - but i loved math i loved science and i
01:39 - really liked building stuff i liked
01:41 - doing kind of like mechanical
01:42 - engineering type work now what i was
01:45 - doing back then was working with lego
01:46 - robots i was uh making like model cars
01:50 - catapults anything that had like a
01:52 - little engineering kind of sense to it i
01:54 - really really enjoy and so this is how i
01:56 - got my first taste of programming
01:58 - because i was working with lego robotics
02:00 - and you can program those you can make
02:02 - them so they go forward or so if the
02:03 - sensor is activated it turns to the left
02:05 - or it picks something up and that's kind
02:07 - of how i got into programming back then
02:10 - was i had this block based editor and i
02:12 - would say okay turn the motor you know
02:14 - 360 degrees okay if the sensor is
02:17 - activated back up whatever you guys get
02:19 - what i'm saying but that was the first
02:21 - introduction of programming back in
02:22 - 2011.
02:24 - alright so fast forward to 2012 i am 12
02:27 - years old and this is when i start
02:29 - actually looking at html and css now i
02:31 - don't know exactly how i ended up
02:33 - getting to this topic but i do remember
02:35 - that i was very obsessed with learning
02:37 - at that age i would come home from
02:38 - school immediately go on my laptop start
02:41 - watching all kinds of youtube videos and
02:43 - just like experimenting with stuff and
02:45 - looking at all kinds of different topics
02:47 - and areas so i probably was googling
02:49 - like what is coding or like how does a
02:51 - computer work or something like that and
02:53 - ended up coming across an html and css
02:56 - tutorial now i remember very clearly
02:58 - that this tutorial was from bucky in
03:00 - fact i watched like hundreds of bucky's
03:01 - videos when i was a kid some of you may
03:04 - know his channel i'll put it up on the
03:05 - screen anyways i end up learning the
03:07 - basics of html the basics of css and in
03:10 - my mind i am programming i am writing
03:12 - code and i am like you know mega genius
03:14 - at 12 years old at least that's what i
03:16 - thought so i start messing with that
03:18 - stuff i'm really really interested in it
03:20 - and i just love the fact that i can go
03:21 - on my computer type in a few lines of
03:23 - code and see something appear in my web
03:25 - browser
03:26 - i really don't have any good idea of
03:28 - what i'm doing i'm just watching a ton
03:30 - of video tutorials and that's pretty
03:31 - much all that's happening in 2012. so
03:34 - fast forward to 2013 i've now done a
03:37 - bunch of html and css i'm able to make
03:39 - some very very basic web pages and kind
03:42 - of style them to some level and i start
03:44 - looking at javascript and php now
03:47 - javascript clearly is kind of a natural
03:49 - follow-up from html i'm now handling
03:51 - events on the website so when you click
03:53 - the button maybe i'm showing you a
03:54 - pop-up where i'm generating a random
03:56 - number or i'm doing something relatively
03:58 - trivial with javascript and then after
04:00 - javascript i'm like okay well now i know
04:02 - how to kind of handle stuff on the
04:03 - website how can i make a functioning
04:05 - website that's going to maybe store data
04:07 - so i start looking at php now i don't
04:10 - look at php for very long this is really
04:12 - complicated to me i don't really
04:13 - understand databases and all that kind
04:15 - of stuff and what ends up happening now
04:17 - in 2013 is i start to realize that i
04:20 - don't really like working on websites
04:22 - i'm not a fan of html i'm not a fan of
04:25 - kind of designing stuff in aesthetics i
04:27 - really liked the javascript programming
04:29 - and the php that was way more fun to me
04:32 - working kind of the logic in the back
04:34 - end of the website again i know it's not
04:36 - really the back end but in my mind it
04:38 - was behind the scenes because i didn't
04:39 - actually see the code that i was writing
04:41 - and so what i did is start looking for
04:43 - stuff that was kind of similar to that
04:44 - that i could mess around with so
04:46 - eventually i found vbs which is a visual
04:48 - basic script and i started writing kind
04:50 - of like little viruses or prank scripts
04:52 - that i could run on my friend's computer
04:54 - so for example i would write a script
04:55 - that would like constantly open the disk
04:57 - drive so it would open the disk drive
04:58 - and then if you push it in it would open
05:00 - it again where it would like rapidly
05:02 - toggle the caps locks button so you
05:03 - couldn't type something obviously i
05:05 - didn't leave these running on the
05:06 - computers i would just put them on kind
05:07 - of like prank them and then turn them
05:09 - off but that's what i was doing at that
05:11 - age now i also ended up jailbreaking a
05:13 - bunch of people's ipods i started kind
05:15 - of looking at more of the hacking side
05:16 - of technology and trying to manipulate
05:18 - stuff that i would use every day as
05:21 - opposed to creating brand new things
05:23 - alright so that was 2013 i'm kind of
05:24 - this immature child that's decent at
05:26 - like technology has some technology
05:28 - literacy and is like messing with people
05:30 - and making pranks and kind of vbs
05:32 - scripts and stuff like that and now we
05:34 - fast forward to 2014 where i start
05:36 - eventually learning c sharp now again
05:39 - this is coming from the realization that
05:40 - i really don't like web development the
05:42 - only thing i did like if it was pretty
05:44 - much the javascript and so i've got
05:46 - through my vbs stage i'm not really that
05:48 - interested in kind of pranking people
05:49 - anymore and what i want to do is learn a
05:51 - legitimate programming language so i end
05:53 - up coming across c sharp don't really
05:55 - know how and start trying to learn that
05:57 - for probably six months to a year so
05:59 - anyways i'm learning c sharp i'm
06:01 - continuing to kind of get better at it
06:03 - i'm learning about a strongly typed
06:04 - language i'm getting into stuff like
06:06 - functions arguments parameters and a lot
06:08 - of words that i just don't even
06:10 - understand at the age of 14 and well
06:12 - it's taking me a really long time to
06:14 - learn this i'm finding this really
06:15 - challenging but that's why i keep
06:17 - learning it because it's kind of one of
06:18 - the first things that i've found that is
06:20 - difficult and that's really testing my
06:22 - mind and my ability so anyways i learned
06:24 - c sharp for pretty much the entire year
06:26 - by the end of learning this for about
06:28 - you know six eight months whatever i'm
06:29 - working on graphical user interfaces
06:32 - kind of messing around with net
06:33 - technology i'm making stuff like
06:35 - calculators i'm making stuff like uh you
06:37 - know graphing programs that can graph
06:39 - like a line and at this point i believe
06:41 - i'm probably in grade nine and i'm
06:43 - showing this to some of my friends
06:44 - showing it to my parents all that kind
06:46 - of stuff anyways that's pretty much all
06:48 - i can remember from 2014 now let's go to
06:50 - 2015. so in 2015 i'm now probably
06:52 - entering grade 10 in high school and i'm
06:55 - taking my first computer science course
06:57 - in high school so in this course we're
06:59 - learning action script now actionscript
07:02 - is something that allows you to program
07:03 - flash games i already have a programming
07:05 - fundamental base i kind of know
07:07 - functions i know like you know basic
07:09 - programming concepts so this course is
07:11 - very very easy for me and so i'm always
07:14 - kind of asking the teacher hey what can
07:15 - i do next is there anything more
07:16 - difficult can you challenge me and he
07:18 - says hey maybe you should join the
07:20 - computer science club so in grade 10 i
07:22 - joined the computer science club and in
07:24 - this club they're actually preparing you
07:26 - to write a competition called the ccc
07:28 - now the ccc is the canadian computing
07:30 - competition hosted by the university of
07:33 - waterloo it's pretty much like five data
07:35 - structures and algorithm questions you
07:37 - get like three hours to answer them and
07:39 - depending on how many test cases you
07:41 - pass on all of the questions you could
07:43 - get invited to round two where you
07:44 - actually go to the university of
07:46 - waterloo and compete against like the
07:48 - best high school programs anyways i
07:50 - realized very quickly that i can't
07:52 - actually write this competition in c
07:54 - sharp which is kind of my main
07:55 - programming language at this point and
07:57 - so i asked my teacher hey what language
07:59 - should i learn because they don't have
08:01 - that as an option for me to submit my
08:02 - code with
08:03 - and he says well you should probably
08:05 - learn python that's what we're going to
08:06 - be doing next year in computer science
08:08 - and the year after and python is just a
08:11 - pretty easy language to learn for
08:12 - beginners so this is where i start
08:14 - getting into python i absolutely love
08:16 - python as soon as i pick it up and i
08:18 - study it for a few months before
08:19 - eventually writing the ccc competition
08:22 - that i end up doing very very poorly on
08:24 - i hadn't really prepared for it very
08:26 - much it was pretty challenging a lot of
08:27 - these questions were kind of math heavy
08:29 - as well and they increase in difficulty
08:31 - from one to five so i probably
08:33 - successfully answered like the first two
08:35 - questions and then completely failed the
08:37 - rest of them but i remember being
08:38 - motivated to kind of come back the next
08:40 - year and try to do better so that's
08:42 - pretty much 2015 this is when i started
08:43 - taking programming a bit more serious
08:45 - it's kind of more of a serious hobby now
08:47 - i'm doing it almost every day and i'm
08:49 - really really enjoying it and starting
08:51 - to realize that this is probably a
08:52 - career path for me all right so now we
08:54 - go to 2016. now 2016 i'm 16 years old i
08:58 - am in grade 11 and i'm taking my
09:01 - computer science course in grade 11. now
09:03 - in this course we're learning basic
09:05 - python i already know all of this
09:07 - because i've been continually learning
09:08 - python since that competition last year
09:11 - and again i sign up for the computer
09:12 - science club where i'm going to compete
09:14 - in the ccc now this year in the ccc i do
09:17 - much better i'm a few points away from
09:19 - actually being being invited to kind of
09:21 - the next round at university of waterloo
09:23 - i'm starting to get way better at
09:25 - programming i'm learning stuff like pie
09:27 - game i'm learning python modules i'm
09:29 - learning object oriented programming and
09:31 - i'm really starting to kind of dive head
09:33 - first into this field and realize that i
09:35 - really enjoy this and i really want to
09:37 - be good at this now other than that i'm
09:38 - probably just working on some larger
09:40 - python projects and actually i believe
09:42 - at this point in time i start looking
09:44 - into xcode and developing ios
09:46 - applications so i remember i wanted to
09:48 - make an ios app that would allow me to
09:50 - like categorize photos of my textbooks
09:53 - so this is kind of a little tangent but
09:55 - i'll tell it because it's an interesting
09:56 - story so i always had to walk to school
09:58 - my walk was like 20 to 25 minutes so i
10:01 - hated having to carry my textbooks
10:03 - because they were super heavy and it was
10:04 - really annoying to walk home with the
10:06 - textbooks so what i did is i would
10:08 - always take photos of any of the
10:09 - homework pages from my textbook so i
10:11 - never had to carry them home i could
10:13 - just do them off my phone but then i
10:15 - would go to my camera roll and i would
10:16 - have like hundreds of photos and i
10:17 - wouldn't be able to find the page so i
10:19 - wanted to make an ios app for my phone
10:22 - where i could just like take a picture
10:23 - of the uh of the textbook page it would
10:26 - automatically like group it into
10:28 - sections or subjects and give me the
10:30 - page number and all of that so i ended
10:32 - up working on that for like six months
10:34 - actually ended up making the app and it
10:35 - worked successfully and i put it on my
10:37 - phone so that was kind of uh you know a
10:39 - cool tangent kind of a side project
10:40 - going on where i was learning swift and
10:42 - objective c and just messing around with
10:45 - xcode and eventually creating this you
10:46 - know very simple app but something i was
10:48 - pretty proud of anyways i think that's
10:50 - pretty much it for 2016. now let's go to
10:52 - 2017. all right so 2017 is probably one
10:55 - of the most important years in my life
10:56 - so far i'm only 21 so take that with a
10:59 - grain of salt but anyways this is grade
11:01 - 12 this is when i really start to get
11:03 - passionate about computer science i know
11:05 - i'm going to go to school for computer
11:06 - science next year i've already applied
11:08 - to a bunch of universities and i'm in my
11:10 - grade 12 computer science course i'm
11:12 - learning big-o notation data structures
11:14 - and algorithms i'm continuing to work
11:16 - with a ton of python modules and i'm
11:18 - just a much more confident and competent
11:20 - program
11:21 - at this point in time i also start
11:23 - working at a summer camp as a stem
11:25 - program coordinator now this means i'm
11:27 - actually running a coding specialty and
11:29 - i'm teaching kids between the age of 11
11:31 - and 15 how to code at a summer camp and
11:33 - i'm actually teaching them python code
11:35 - so a real programming language and this
11:38 - is when i realized that i really enjoy
11:39 - teaching i'm super happy doing that and
11:42 - so i start the youtube channel where i
11:43 - start teaching python too well all of
11:45 - you now at some point in time during
11:47 - this year i start posting more and more
11:49 - videos on youtube this would be when i
11:51 - created something like the golf game
11:52 - that some of you may have seen on this
11:54 - channel it's a python kind of like mini
11:56 - golf game anyways i'm working on a lot
11:58 - of larger projects i'm getting way
11:59 - better at coding and again starting to
12:01 - really realize okay this is a career
12:03 - path this is what i want to do and then
12:05 - i eventually get into the university of
12:07 - ottawa for computer science as well as a
12:09 - few other universities i do choose
12:10 - uottawa and now we'll go to 2018 where i
12:13 - start my first year of university
12:15 - alright so 2018 first year of university
12:18 - also mentioned the summer before going
12:19 - to university i did my second year of
12:22 - the stem program coordinator at the
12:24 - summer camp which was great again
12:26 - continuing to post some youtube videos
12:27 - for the kids at the camp then i get to
12:30 - university i'm taking my first year
12:32 - computer science courses so introduction
12:34 - to computing i'm taking linear algebra
12:36 - calculus all of that type of stuff i'm
12:39 - living in residence in a big huge
12:41 - building with like hundreds of people in
12:42 - kind of like apartment style i have a
12:44 - roommate and this is when i really start
12:46 - getting serious about my youtube channel
12:48 - so i realized quite quickly into
12:49 - university that studying for courses is
12:52 - not going to take up nearly enough of my
12:54 - time i just really had a lot of extra
12:56 - time in university i was playing video
12:58 - games i was wasting it doing a bunch of
13:00 - stuff that i wasn't proud of doing and
13:01 - so what i did instead was say okay
13:04 - what can i do that's going to be
13:05 - productive that i'm going to enjoy and
13:07 - that's going to help me in the future
13:08 - and my answer to that was my youtube
13:10 - channel so at this point in time i had
13:11 - like two or three thousand subscribers
13:13 - but i really enjoyed posting on there
13:15 - and coming up with the educational
13:17 - content so i said to myself i'm gonna
13:18 - post a youtube video every single day
13:20 - for as long as i can so the unfortunate
13:23 - thing though was i had a roommate i
13:25 - we're in this like you know big
13:26 - apartment-style building and so it's
13:27 - really loud throughout the day and i
13:29 - just wasn't really able to record when
13:32 - my roommate's in the room and it just
13:33 - didn't work out very well for me to be
13:35 - recording at normal times so what i had
13:37 - to do is wake up at 5 30 a.m every
13:39 - single morning for as long as i could
13:41 - and film youtube videos between the
13:43 - hours of like 5 30 and 8 or 9 a.m and
13:46 - then start the rest of my day now this
13:48 - completely changed my life i got to a
13:50 - point where i was being so extremely
13:51 - productive i could probably do what i
13:53 - would normally do in a week in like six
13:55 - seven hours a day i was grinding really
13:57 - really hard but it completely paid off
13:59 - and over that first year of university
14:01 - or at least that first semester i grew
14:03 - my youtube channel for like two or three
14:05 - thousand subscribers it's like 15 20 25
14:08 - 30k and i think by the time i ended
14:11 - first year of university which is gonna
14:12 - be 2019 i probably had like 30 or 40 000
14:16 - subscribers on youtube
14:18 - anyways at this point since i'm doing so
14:20 - many youtube videos i'm learning flask
14:22 - i'm learning django i'm learning python
14:24 - web development i'm getting into a ton
14:26 - of other python modules and i'm really
14:28 - expanding my programming knowledge i'm
14:30 - learning math i'm learning get and i'm
14:32 - just learning a ton of stuff because of
14:33 - the amount of time that i'm spending
14:35 - work anyways now we move to 2019 now
14:38 - 2019 is going to be like end of first
14:40 - year beginning of second year university
14:42 - now in between that i'm working at the
14:44 - summer camp for the third time as a stem
14:46 - program coordinator and this is when i'm
14:48 - continuing to grow the youtube channel
14:50 - and now i'm sitting with a youtube
14:51 - channel that has like you know multiple
14:53 - 10 000 subscribers so i'm feeling good
14:55 - about that i'm posting a ton more
14:57 - content i'm starting to learn stuff like
14:59 - machine learning artificial intelligence
15:02 - i'm learning like tensorflow
15:04 - scikit-learn pi torch all of that type
15:06 - of stuff i'm now partnering with
15:08 - companies like free code camp i'm sure
15:10 - many of you know them and really just
15:12 - starting to kind of get involved in the
15:13 - programming community and start to learn
15:16 - most of my stuff on my own rather than
15:18 - from school so of course as i'm in
15:20 - university i'm learning you know
15:22 - computing too which means i'm learning
15:23 - stuff like java i'm learning data
15:25 - structures and algorithms in a formal
15:27 - course so i'm using java for that as
15:29 - well i'm learning programming paradigms
15:31 - so i'm learning languages like go like
15:33 - haskell like oh camel i'm kind of diving
15:36 - into all of these university courses but
15:38 - at the same time i'm doing a ton of work
15:40 - on my own and kind of just getting
15:42 - better at programming on the side with
15:44 - side projects and all the youtube videos
15:46 - that i'm posting so now near the end of
15:48 - 2019 this is when i actually start
15:50 - looking for internships for 2020 i
15:52 - really want to work as a software
15:54 - engineer ideally at a large tech company
15:56 - you know i'm targeting like a google
15:58 - microsoft amazon whatever but i'm also
16:00 - totally fine to go to a local company so
16:02 - i interviewed at shopify at ibm at bell
16:05 - actually which was uh close to where i
16:07 - was living at the time in ottawa anyways
16:09 - i was doing a ton of interviews and i
16:11 - started practicing my data structures
16:13 - and algorithms and doing like the coding
16:15 - interview type questions where i
16:17 - actually used algo expert now this is
16:19 - when i started a relationship with
16:20 - clement this is when i did a video on
16:23 - his channel with like a mock google
16:24 - coding interview and i started getting
16:26 - way better at these types of questions
16:28 - and then eventually ended up getting an
16:30 - interview at microsoft and some of you
16:32 - know how that goes but now we're gonna
16:34 - go to 2020 where i'll talk about that
16:36 - all right so 2020 i am continuing to
16:38 - grind for my technical interviews i'm
16:40 - doing all kinds of data structures and
16:42 - algorithms type problems doing almost
16:44 - all of the ones on algo expert anyways
16:47 - then i end up getting flown to microsoft
16:49 - for my in-person technical interviews
16:51 - this is in january before the pandemic
16:53 - is really known in the world so i do
16:56 - them end up passing those technical
16:58 - interviews i get a job offer from
16:59 - microsoft three days later i do my
17:01 - technical interviews at shopify end up
17:03 - getting one from them as well i end up
17:05 - deciding to choose microsoft because i
17:07 - was excited to actually go in person to
17:09 - microsoft to work there of course we
17:11 - know that didn't end up happening
17:13 - regardless though then the pandemic
17:14 - happens kind of puts everything on pause
17:16 - for i guess like a month or so that's
17:18 - probably an accurate timeline i end up
17:20 - moving back home away from school so out
17:23 - of ottawa
17:24 - doing school remotely and continuing to
17:26 - learn computer science stuff from school
17:28 - right so i'm learning languages like
17:30 - golang now i'm learning about
17:32 - programming language concepts computer
17:34 - architecture digital systems all that
17:37 - kind of fun stuff and continuing to work
17:39 - on the youtube channel which at this
17:40 - point in time probably has about 150 000
17:42 - subscribers
17:44 - okay continuing i go to microsoft i'm
17:46 - working on the python extension for
17:49 - visual studio code an absolutely great
17:51 - fit for me
17:52 - at microsoft we're using typescript and
17:54 - javascript for the entire extension so i
17:56 - end up learning typescript and working
17:58 - in that for about three or four months
18:00 - okay so after leaving microsoft because
18:02 - that was just a summer internship i now
18:04 - start school again i am now doing my
18:07 - first semester of third year so i'm
18:09 - learning some other programming stuff
18:10 - there although nothing super notable and
18:12 - i end up actually getting a job at algo
18:15 - expert as an algorithms instructor which
18:17 - i am doing while i am running my youtube
18:19 - channel and while i am going to school
18:21 - so i am extremely busy i'm working like
18:23 - 12 hours days every single day
18:25 - just really grinding because i have a
18:27 - job school as well as the youtube
18:29 - channel which is pretty much a full-time
18:31 - job as well and i end up doing that
18:33 - until i finish my first semester of
18:35 - third year and then i drop out of school
18:37 - alright so 2021 this year i am now
18:40 - dropped out of school i am so happy i
18:42 - finally have some time back in my life
18:44 - i'm not as stressed as i was before long
18:47 - story short on that decision i was
18:49 - generating a significant amount of
18:50 - revenue and it just really didn't make
18:51 - sense to be in school anymore this was
18:53 - not a you know on the whim decision this
18:55 - was something that had been thought
18:56 - about for a long time anyways i continue
18:59 - working at algo expert as an algorithms
19:01 - instructor so continuing to develop my
19:03 - uh you know algorithms data structure
19:05 - knowledge i then really start getting
19:07 - into front-end frameworks learning stuff
19:09 - like react learning a bit more about
19:11 - styling and css and really working on
19:14 - kind of full stack web applications that
19:16 - you guys would have seen me release at
19:17 - kind of end of 2020 beginning of 2021 on
19:20 - the youtube channel of course i'm
19:22 - continuing to work on the youtube
19:23 - channel and then i start working on
19:26 - programming expert now programming
19:28 - expert i talked about at the beginning
19:30 - of this video essentially it's an entire
19:32 - platform to learn how to code and i
19:34 - started planning that as early as
19:36 - february of last year so we kind of had
19:38 - the idea signed all the logistical
19:40 - contracts and all of that then started
19:42 - coming up with the curriculum and
19:44 - building that out pretty much for the
19:45 - entire year until we released it just i
19:48 - guess about a week ago from when i'm
19:49 - filming this video anyways you can check
19:51 - it out from
19:52 - programmingexpert.io but that's what
19:54 - i've been working on for a very long
19:56 - time which means really in this year i
19:58 - haven't been learning a lot related to
20:00 - programming i've been focusing on
20:02 - building this product working on the
20:03 - youtube channel expanding the business
20:06 - and yeah that's what i've been doing
20:08 - now as a side note i actually ended up
20:10 - moving out of my parents house to my own
20:12 - place that was kind of a huge thing that
20:13 - i did at the beginning of the year and
20:16 - now i am pretty well done with this
20:18 - video and everything that i went through
20:20 - now this video did not turn out exactly
20:22 - how i planned for it to be it was kind
20:23 - of more of a life story than it was and
20:26 - necessarily you know what i've learned
20:27 - programming although it did start in
20:29 - that way regardless i hope that gave
20:31 - some value to you guys and i just want
20:33 - to quickly tell you what i'm planning
20:35 - for 2022 in case you've stuck around
20:38 - till the end of this video so for 2022
20:40 - my main goals here are to improve my
20:42 - front-end development skills i really
20:44 - want to learn more about front-end
20:46 - frameworks i want to learn more about
20:47 - javascript and css and be more
20:49 - comfortable working on the front end of
20:51 - websites because i think i have the
20:53 - back-end skills down pretty well i want
20:55 - to continue to improve programming
20:57 - expert dot io again find it from the
20:59 - link in the description i want to be
21:01 - practicing golang go is kind of the next
21:03 - language i really want to transition
21:04 - into and then i want to do some more
21:06 - work on blockchain and cryptocurrency
21:08 - cryptocurrency which is actually what
21:10 - i've been working on a little bit right
21:12 - now and i have a series plan for you
21:13 - guys where i'm going to be teaching you
21:14 - solidity and how to actually host your
21:17 - own smart contracts and work with
21:19 - cryptocurrency
21:20 - regardless with that said that is going
21:22 - to end this video this video has taken a
21:25 - long time to make if you guys enjoyed
21:26 - please leave a like subscribe to the
21:28 - channel leave a comment with your
21:30 - journey learning how to code down below
21:32 - and i will see you in another youtube
21:34 - video
