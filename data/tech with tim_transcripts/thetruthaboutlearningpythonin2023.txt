00:03 - foreign
00:15 - brand new year and already there's a ton
00:18 - of stuff affecting the tech industry
00:20 - we've got tools like chat GPT all kinds
00:23 - of tech layoffs just the economy in
00:25 - general and if you're a software
00:26 - engineer or programmer you're rightfully
00:28 - probably a little bit worried and
00:30 - concerned and thinking about how you can
00:31 - best prepare for what may happen in the
00:34 - next 6 12 18 months Etc now I'm not here
00:37 - to worry you I think that if you're in
00:38 - the tech industry you're going to be
00:40 - completely fine really what I would be
00:42 - doing now is just working on your skills
00:44 - getting as good as you possibly can and
00:46 - proving to either your current employer
00:47 - that you're worth keeping around or to a
00:49 - new employer that you're worth taking on
00:51 - even though the hiring is kind of slowed
00:53 - down a little bit right now so kind of
00:55 - summary here don't be too concerned I
00:57 - think everything is going to be fine and
00:59 - what I'm going to do in this video is
01:00 - talk to you about python specifically
01:02 - and if I think you should be learning
01:04 - that in 2023 based on everything that's
01:06 - going on obviously you guys know this a
01:09 - python Focus Channel I'm sure many of
01:11 - you are beginners just getting into
01:12 - python fun and maybe you're a little bit
01:14 - scared with what's going on right now
01:15 - and wondering should I kind of be
01:16 - learning this should I keep going into
01:18 - this field and many of you are probably
01:20 - intermediate or Advanced python
01:22 - programmers and thinking about should I
01:23 - change languages should I diversify a
01:25 - bit and that's what I'm hopefully going
01:27 - to answer here specifically I'm going to
01:29 - tell you why I think you should learn
01:30 - python why I think you shouldn't Learn
01:32 - Python and then other languages I'd
01:34 - recommend if you're going to be moving
01:35 - away from the Python language with that
01:38 - said let's get into the video after a
01:40 - quick word from our sponsor before we
01:42 - get started I need to thank lenode for
01:44 - sponsoring this video I've been using
01:46 - and working with lenode for nearly three
01:48 - years now and they've consistently been
01:50 - my go-to choice for hosting my
01:51 - applications and servers in fact right
01:54 - now I'm using the node to host the
01:55 - official Tech with Tim Discord bot a
01:58 - website multiple of my domains and a
02:00 - kubernetes cluster now lenode was just
02:02 - recently acquired by Akamai and as a
02:04 - part of this acquisition they're going
02:05 - to be adding more than a dozen new data
02:07 - centers around the world in the next
02:09 - year lenode makes it super easy to spin
02:11 - up servers with their one Click app
02:13 - Marketplace and have tons of written
02:15 - guides and YouTube videos on their
02:16 - channel to help you get started now if
02:18 - you're having any issues you can reach
02:20 - out to the 24 7 support team and
02:22 - actually talk with a real human being
02:24 - now the nodes pricing is simple with no
02:26 - hidden fees and full transparency and
02:28 - you can test out the node services for
02:30 - free by using the link in the
02:32 - description and claiming a 100.60 day
02:34 - credit for any new accounts it's been an
02:37 - absolute pleasure to work with lenode
02:38 - over the past few years and one last
02:40 - thank you to them for sponsoring this
02:42 - video
02:44 - foreign
02:49 - so just as a mini preface here before I
02:51 - get into the main points of the video if
02:53 - you're someone who's just getting into
02:54 - python you're just getting into software
02:56 - engineering I think you should still
02:57 - continue down this path this is
02:59 - definitely something that's going to
03:01 - give you a ton of opportunities it's a
03:02 - great skill to have in general even if
03:04 - you're not employed as like a programmer
03:06 - or a software engineer and I don't think
03:08 - you need to be overly concerned that's
03:10 - my opinion obviously everyone has their
03:12 - own but I'm still working on new skills
03:14 - right now I'm learning new languages and
03:16 - I'm improving constantly no matter what
03:18 - kind of the market looks like with that
03:20 - said if you guys do want to get a
03:21 - comprehensive overview of python just
03:23 - software engineering skills in general I
03:25 - do have a course it's called
03:26 - programmingexpert.io I will leave that
03:28 - link in the description
03:31 - foreign
03:36 - so let's get into the bulk of the video
03:37 - here and discuss why you should learn
03:39 - python or continue learning it so first
03:42 - of all python is a general purpose
03:44 - programming language it's extremely
03:46 - popular used by tens of millions of
03:48 - people typically ranked one of the most
03:49 - popular programming languages in the
03:51 - world based on use case as well as
03:53 - demand for developers there is tons of
03:56 - different jobs and you can really do
03:58 - anything you want with python with that
04:00 - said python is not always the best best
04:03 - language story for a specific task but
04:05 - since it is so General you can pretty
04:07 - much do anything you could imagine so if
04:10 - You Learn Python you have the ability to
04:11 - do machine learning you can make a
04:13 - website you can make a game you can make
04:15 - a back-end server or API you can mess
04:17 - around with databases pretty much
04:19 - anything you can imagine you can write
04:21 - in Python so as a first language it's
04:23 - very good because it gives you a lot of
04:25 - different Avenues and allows you to
04:27 - explore a bunch of different options
04:28 - before maybe learning a more specific
04:30 - language for the specific path that you
04:33 - want to go down with that said python is
04:35 - also a very beginner friendly language
04:37 - it's typically very fast to learn if you
04:39 - already know a language it's going to be
04:41 - very fast you can probably pick it up in
04:43 - a few weeks or maybe even a month and
04:46 - it's something that's very easy to read
04:47 - and fast to write coding so if you're
04:50 - someone who's maybe not thinking about
04:52 - being a career software engineer you're
04:54 - just kind of learning programming to
04:55 - pick up a little bit of a side skill
04:57 - maybe it's something that interests you
04:58 - definitely a language I would recommend
05:00 - because of the general purpose aspect of
05:02 - it and the fact that it's going to be
05:04 - very fast to learn and it's not super
05:06 - complicated there's a lot of other
05:08 - programming languages that may be better
05:10 - suited for a specific task but are a bit
05:12 - more complex there's more Theory more
05:14 - logic that you need to learn and it can
05:16 - be a bit discouraging whereas python I
05:18 - find people typically build a lot of
05:20 - confidence with it very quickly start
05:22 - building apps projects Etc then that
05:24 - accelerates them into a second third
05:26 - fourth language you know beyond that so
05:29 - hopefully that's kind of a general
05:30 - overview of python now relating python
05:32 - to the current situation I think python
05:35 - is a great language to learn especially
05:37 - if you're going to be interviewing so if
05:39 - you're going to be interviewing I like
05:40 - doing it in Python because it's a very
05:42 - fast language to write just in terms of
05:44 - the syntax it's very simple it's very
05:46 - easy for your interviewer to read it and
05:48 - it has a lot of helpful like functions
05:51 - methods Etc that can save you quite a
05:53 - bit of time when you're doing a coding
05:55 - interview so something to consider doing
05:57 - a coding interview in Python I would say
05:59 - is way easier than doing it in like Java
06:01 - or C plus plus or c-sharp or something
06:03 - else that you may know personally I did
06:06 - all of my coding interviews in Python
06:07 - and even if someone doesn't know python
06:10 - since it's just such a simple language
06:12 - uh like kind of with the syntax of it
06:14 - it's very easy for them to read and
06:15 - understand what you're doing now going
06:17 - beyond that I will mention that python
06:19 - does have a ton of jobs typically python
06:21 - is going to be some kind of requirement
06:23 - or you're going to have to be at least
06:24 - familiar with the language and that's
06:26 - because it really is used everywhere and
06:29 - you're gonna find it in a lot of code
06:30 - bases even if it's not the core language
06:32 - for different scripts or kind of smaller
06:35 - aspects of the code code and a lot of
06:36 - employers want to know that you have
06:38 - some comfort and some familiarity with
06:40 - it so even though it's not always going
06:41 - to be the primary language you need to
06:43 - know to get a job it's typically some
06:45 - kind of prerequisite and there is a lot
06:47 - of just straight python jobs so with
06:49 - that said that's why I think you should
06:51 - learn python now let's talk about why
06:53 - you shouldn't Learn Python
07:00 - so why should you not Learn Python well
07:03 - there's many reasons here but most of
07:05 - them stem from the fact that python is a
07:07 - very general language now that's good in
07:09 - some instances but in this case it's bad
07:11 - because that means that python is not
07:13 - the best language for a lot of different
07:15 - specific tasks so for example you can
07:18 - make a game with python but it's not
07:19 - going to be the best performing game and
07:21 - you'd probably be better off using
07:22 - something like c-sharp and unity for
07:25 - example you can do let's say a mobile
07:27 - app with python but again you'd probably
07:29 - be better off using a native language
07:31 - like Swift or kotlin you can do
07:33 - something like a website with python or
07:35 - a backend with python but you might be
07:37 - better off using something like go or
07:39 - rust so you see that although python can
07:41 - be used for so many different things if
07:43 - you're going to be a specialist in one
07:44 - specific area a lot of times employers
07:47 - are going to look for someone who knows
07:48 - the best language or the best Frameworks
07:50 - in that area now that's not always the
07:52 - case there is a lot of just pure python
07:54 - jobs where companies use only python
07:57 - where they have their website or their
07:58 - game or whatever in Python on like I
08:00 - mentioned before but in a lot of other
08:02 - cases you have companies that may have
08:04 - python as a second or third language
08:06 - that you need to know and before that
08:08 - they want you to be a pro at whatever
08:10 - the main languages for the kind of
08:12 - domain or task that you're going to be
08:13 - completing so if you're going to be a
08:15 - game developer you probably want to know
08:16 - unity and C sharp if you're going to be
08:18 - a website designer you probably want to
08:20 - know JavaScript hopefully you get where
08:22 - I'm going here but since python is so
08:24 - General you lose out on a lot of really
08:26 - specific jobs and kind of tasks if
08:29 - that's the only thing that you know so
08:32 - that's the main reason why I wouldn't
08:33 - Learn Python or if I already know it I
08:36 - might transition into something else
08:37 - just to make myself a bit more
08:39 - well-rounded and have more experience in
08:41 - a specific Niche or more knowledge in a
08:43 - specific area so really the main point
08:45 - there is that python is more of a
08:47 - general language you're going to be more
08:48 - of a generalist with that whereas with
08:50 - another language you're typically going
08:51 - to be more of a specialist and maybe
08:53 - have some better prospects maybe some
08:55 - higher paying jobs or some more
08:57 - opportunity just because you know a
08:59 - language that maybe not not everyone
09:00 - knows whereas python kind of a lot of
09:02 - people know that and we consider
09:04 - themselves kind of fluent or competent
09:06 - in that area something worth considering
09:08 - going beyond that I will also mention
09:10 - that if python is currently the language
09:12 - that you know and you're good at python
09:14 - it's probably a good idea to Branch out
09:16 - and learn a second or third language
09:17 - rather than just kind of diving into
09:19 - becoming an expert in Python that's
09:22 - because again you've already picked up
09:23 - that General language and now it's going
09:25 - to be worth it to pick up something more
09:27 - special where you can actually build you
09:29 - know more real production applications
09:31 - or stuff that's going to be better
09:32 - performing than what you might do with
09:34 - python there's a whole bunch of reasons
09:36 - here python is also a very slow
09:38 - programming language and I could go on
09:40 - and on on why you should and why you
09:41 - shouldn't Learn Python but I wanted to
09:43 - try to give you both perspectives here
09:45 - before I now move into the next section
09:47 - where I talk to you about what I would
09:48 - learn if you're not going to Learn
09:50 - Python
09:55 - foreign so let's say at this point
09:58 - you've decided that you're not going to
09:59 - be picking up python I'm not going to
10:01 - tell you that's the right or wrong
10:02 - decision depends on what you want to do
10:04 - and what field you're going to be
10:05 - getting into or what you're interested
10:07 - in again to recap if you're a beginner
10:09 - I'd probably go with python learn that
10:11 - first build up some confidence if you're
10:12 - a bit more experienced or you're someone
10:14 - who already knows what field you want to
10:15 - go into directly then I would pick up
10:17 - maybe a different language regardless if
10:20 - you're not going to be learning python
10:21 - here are the languages I would recommend
10:22 - in 2023 these are ones that I'm
10:25 - personally learning and I'll go through
10:26 - a kind of a brief rationale for each so
10:29 - first I might recommend doing some
10:30 - blockchain and web 3 development now I
10:32 - know that market is kind of Tanked just
10:34 - a lot lower than it was before but I
10:36 - still think that this is going to be the
10:38 - future of programming and of the
10:40 - internet and there is still a lot of
10:41 - money in this space and a lot of people
10:43 - hiring it's actually very difficult to
10:45 - find web3 Engineers I work with a few
10:47 - web 3 companies and they're constantly
10:49 - looking for talent sometimes they're
10:50 - even hiring people that don't know any
10:52 - web 3 skills and then training them and
10:54 - paying them on the job if you want to
10:56 - learn that I do have a blockchain expert
10:58 - course I'll link that in the description
11:00 - you can learn everything you need to
11:01 - know about web3 and blockchain
11:03 - technology so that's one thing I might
11:04 - consider beyond that I would probably
11:06 - learn a language like JavaScript
11:08 - JavaScript is again a more General
11:10 - language but it's really good
11:11 - specifically for web development so it's
11:14 - a relatively easy language to learn kind
11:16 - of similar to python but it's really
11:18 - good for building front-end user
11:19 - interfaces for building websites even
11:21 - for working on the back end sometimes as
11:23 - well if you want to do it like that you
11:25 - have options like react native view
11:28 - angular react there's all kinds of
11:30 - different Frameworks you can use with it
11:31 - and it's super high in demand it's
11:33 - typically kind of tied or similar
11:35 - placing with python in terms of the most
11:37 - popular programming languages so I don't
11:39 - think you'd be poorly served by learning
11:41 - JavaScript especially if you want to get
11:43 - into web development it's pretty much a
11:45 - must if you want to get into the web
11:46 - development space continuing I might
11:48 - recommend something like go go is a
11:51 - newer and more modern programming
11:52 - language also referred to as golang it's
11:55 - a language that I personally really like
11:56 - kind of combines the performance of a
11:58 - language like C plus plus with the
12:01 - Simplicity and kind of speed to write of
12:04 - a language like python so if you do like
12:06 - python you like the style of writing
12:08 - python code but you want something maybe
12:09 - a bit more Enterprise ready a bit more
12:12 - performant than I look at go and that is
12:14 - taught in my programming expert course
12:16 - now lastly I'd say you might want to
12:18 - consider learning something like rust I
12:20 - don't have a ton of experience in this
12:22 - language but I did work on it a little
12:24 - bit and posted kind of like a mini
12:25 - series on the channel for it a lot of
12:27 - you guys really seem to like the
12:29 - language it's growing rapidly in
12:30 - popularity there's a ton of demand for
12:32 - rust developers and even though it's not
12:34 - the most popular language out there I
12:37 - think that in a few years it might be
12:38 - there and it's something worth taking a
12:40 - look at because if you could learn it
12:42 - now and be one of the earlier rust
12:43 - developers I think you're going to have
12:45 - a lot of opportunity kind of in the next
12:47 - few years so those would be my
12:48 - recommendations here if you're not going
12:50 - to be learning python regardless I think
12:52 - you should still continue programming
12:54 - still improve your skills check out
12:55 - products I have like Pro programming
12:57 - expert and blockchain expert if you want
12:59 - a more kind of tailored way to do that
13:01 - obviously I do have hundreds of videos
13:02 - on this channel too that can help you
13:04 - learn those skills with that said I hope
13:06 - you enjoyed if you did make sure to
13:07 - leave a like subscribe the channel and I
13:09 - will see you in the next one
13:18 - [Music]
