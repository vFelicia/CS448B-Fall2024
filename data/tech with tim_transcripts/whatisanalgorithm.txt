00:00 - now an algorithm is really just a set of
00:02 - steps or a procedure that you need to
00:04 - follow to solve a problem an algorithm
00:07 - is not only applicable in the context of
00:09 - coding you could write an algorithm to
00:11 - follow to solve a mathematical problem
00:13 - you could write an algorithm to follow
00:14 - to upload a video to YouTube you can
00:17 - write all kinds of different types of
00:18 - algorithms and usually people refer to
00:20 - them in the coding context but I just
00:22 - want to clarify that algorithm is a
00:23 - general word it's not just for code
