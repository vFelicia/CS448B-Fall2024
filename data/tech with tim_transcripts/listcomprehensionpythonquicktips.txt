00:00 - hello everyone and welcome back so in
00:01 - this video I'm going to be talking about
00:03 - list comprehension that most people are
00:05 - aware of what list comprehension are but
00:07 - they don't actually know the proper ways
00:08 - to use it or some of the other methods
00:10 - that can go with it so so I'm gonna be
00:12 - showing here so what means list
00:13 - comprehension is a faster way to build a
00:15 - list not computationally but just in
00:17 - terms of writing blinds so for example
00:20 - if I'd like to build a list X here and
00:21 - let's say I want it to have the value 0
00:23 - to 10 well rather than creating a for
00:25 - loop and saying for I in range 10 and
00:28 - then appending values in there from the
00:30 - for loop I can do that directly inside
00:32 - of my list right here so I can do
00:34 - something like I for I in range 10 and
00:39 - if I run this now you see we get a list
00:42 - that goes from 0 to 10 so essentially
00:44 - you put here on the left side what you
00:45 - want to be populated in the list then
00:48 - you do the condition here which is for I
00:50 - in range 10 and that will run change I
00:52 - ten times and populate the list now most
00:55 - people know this but it gets way more
00:57 - advanced than this and you can even add
00:58 - conditions afterwards so you can do
01:00 - something like for I in range if I
01:03 - modulus two equals equals zero which
01:06 - means you're only gonna get even numbers
01:07 - in your list here so now we get 0 2 4 6
01:10 - 8 and so on now we can do more
01:13 - conditions and we can add even more
01:14 - things so I can do something like I
01:17 - comma Y for I and range 10 for Y in
01:24 - range 20 now this is gonna look a little
01:27 - bit ridiculous but you guys get the
01:29 - point here what this will do now is
01:30 - build us every single combination of
01:32 - these two for loops so essentially every
01:35 - time this loop runs this loop will run
01:37 - which means we're gonna get 0 0 1 0 2 0
01:40 - 3 0 4 0 5 and so on and then 1 1 1 1 1
01:44 - and all of that so it's a fast way to
01:46 - build lists and you can do some cool
01:47 - things with it now let's say we don't
01:49 - want to do something necessarily like
01:50 - that what we can do is also put a list
01:53 - inside of a list so I can do a list for
01:55 - I and range 10 if I print this now we
01:57 - get a bunch of lists inside of this list
01:59 - and then inside here I could put another
02:01 - before loop so for I in range 5 and
02:06 - maybe I don't want to have I maybe I
02:08 - don't want it to go counting up from 1 2
02:10 - 3 4 5 well I can just put 0 for I in
02:12 - range
02:13 - five and if I do this then I get a list
02:15 - full of zeros in the same sense I could
02:17 - do something like true for I in range
02:19 - five and then I get a list completely
02:21 - full of troops then I can put another if
02:23 - statement inside of here and you get the
02:25 - point it can go on infinitely now I can
02:27 - even do another list here and keep
02:29 - building and keep building and keep
02:30 - building and that is kind of how this
02:32 - comprehension works so this is very
02:34 - useful it can save you a lot of time and
02:36 - especially when you're creating
02:37 - multi-dimensional lists you just need to
02:39 - set up rows and columns it's very fast
02:41 - to just do something like this where you
02:43 - have you know 0 for I and range 5 for I
02:45 - in range let's say 5 and that will make
02:47 - you you know a 5 by 5 grid of arrays
02:49 - here that you guys can use in access so
02:51 - anyways that has been list comprehension
02:52 - there is some more to this but this is
02:54 - the basics and what most of you will end
02:56 - up using an everyday programming if you
02:58 - guys enjoyed make sure you leave a like
02:59 - and again let me know what you want to
