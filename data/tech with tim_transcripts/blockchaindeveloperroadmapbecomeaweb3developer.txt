00:01 - thank you
00:02 - [Music]
00:15 - in this video I'm going to share with
00:16 - you a practical roadmap of all the
00:18 - skills topics and technologies that you
00:21 - need to learn to become a blockchain or
00:23 - web 3 developer
00:25 - [Music]
00:29 - now fortunately for you if you already
00:31 - know how to code this is actually a
00:33 - pretty simple thing to get into and I
00:35 - would imagine that after the next four
00:37 - or five months if you really put your
00:38 - head down and tried to study this
00:39 - content you'd be ready to land a pretty
00:41 - high paying web 3 or blockchain
00:43 - development role now one of the reasons
00:46 - for that is that all of this stuff is so
00:48 - new and a lot of companies are in
00:49 - desperate need for developers there's a
00:51 - ton of new startups right now a ton of
00:53 - web 3 companies and they need to hire
00:55 - blockchain and web3 developers and the
00:57 - fact is there's just not enough of them
00:59 - out there not enough people have these
01:00 - skills and what that actually means is a
01:03 - lot of these companies are hiring
01:04 - developers with no blockchain skills
01:06 - with no web 3 skills and training them
01:09 - while paying them so that they're
01:11 - qualified for the job just because they
01:12 - need developers and they can't wait they
01:14 - need to train people that need to get
01:15 - people into this industry and I myself
01:17 - work with a lot of web3 companies this
01:19 - is what they're telling me and that's
01:21 - why they're paying me to create web 3
01:22 - tutorials to teach you guys so that they
01:25 - can hire you
01:26 - thank you
01:30 - so with all of that said I have a quick
01:32 - announcement that I need to make here
01:33 - before we dive into this content and
01:35 - that's that pretty much everything
01:36 - you're about to hear me talk about in
01:38 - this video in terms of what you need to
01:39 - learn is available in a course that I'm
01:41 - launching today called blockchain expert
01:44 - now this course available from the link
01:46 - in the description we're doing a 25 off
01:49 - sale uh kind of for the launch events if
01:51 - you want to take advantage of that
01:52 - please do and this course is made by
01:54 - myself the algo expert team it's
01:56 - actually reviewed by chain link
01:58 - Engineers to make sure everything is
01:59 - completely accurate and that it has the
02:01 - most up-to-date blockchain information
02:03 - and this is a massive course with almost
02:05 - 30 hours of video content that teaches
02:08 - you again everything you need to know to
02:10 - become a blockchain developer I'll
02:12 - quickly run through some of the topics
02:13 - and kind of sections that we have in
02:15 - there but we teach you blockchain
02:16 - fundamentals all of the security
02:18 - mechanisms like how do transactions work
02:20 - how are blocks working what is proof of
02:22 - stake what is proof of work and some of
02:24 - the mathematics and cryptography behind
02:26 - that we also get into ethereum a little
02:28 - bit of decentralized Finance we then of
02:31 - course teach solidity so basic solidity
02:33 - as well as advanced solidity code we
02:35 - show you how to deploy smart contracts
02:37 - how to interact with them using
02:38 - JavaScript how to use web3 tools for
02:41 - real professional development how to
02:43 - test your smart contracts and then
02:45 - lastly how to create fully decentralized
02:47 - applications that run entirely on a
02:49 - blockchain network and have a full front
02:52 - end and act just like any other
02:53 - application that you've built before so
02:55 - if you guys want to learn this please
02:57 - check it out from the link in the
02:58 - description I've spent a massive amount
03:00 - of time working on this and just like
03:02 - programming expert kind of my other main
03:03 - course this really is something that is
03:06 - just great value you guys are going to
03:07 - see I think you're all going to enjoy it
03:09 - and love it and in my opinion it's
03:11 - really just the best resource right now
03:12 - on the internet to learn blockchain
03:14 - development now I know this is kind of a
03:16 - huge ad in the middle of this video but
03:18 - what I'm going to do now is walk you
03:20 - through the curriculum that essentially
03:21 - this course covers and if you don't want
03:23 - to go through the paid course that's
03:25 - totally fine you can learn this stuff on
03:27 - your own and I'm going to give you
03:28 - everything that you need to do just
03:30 - understand it is going to take you
03:31 - longer and you're probably going to be
03:32 - finding some kind of inaccurate
03:34 - information and missing all of those
03:36 - practice questions assessment questions
03:38 - projects Etc that you'll get with kind
03:40 - of a premium offering like blockchain
03:42 - expert
03:43 - [Music]
03:47 - so anyways let's get into it here and
03:49 - let me walk you through kind of the
03:50 - first thing you need to learn if you
03:52 - want to become a web 3 or blockchain
03:54 - developer now that's going to be
03:55 - blockchain fundamentals and blockchain
03:58 - Theory now what I mean by that is
04:00 - understanding how a blockchain network
04:02 - works what is a blockchain how do you
04:04 - send transactions how are transactions
04:07 - secure and digitally verified what are
04:09 - blocks what is proof of work what is
04:11 - proof of stake you need to dive into the
04:14 - theory behind all of this and understand
04:16 - how these networks like Bitcoin ethereum
04:19 - Solana all these other popular
04:21 - cryptocurrencies understand how they
04:23 - actually work how they function on a
04:25 - lower level in my opinion you can't even
04:27 - go and start writing smart contracts or
04:29 - doing any programming until you
04:31 - understand those kind of Concepts and if
04:33 - you're an investor in the space as well
04:34 - I definitely recommend that you learn
04:36 - all of this stuff because it allows you
04:38 - to actually kind of see through kind of
04:40 - some of these scams or Ponzi schemes and
04:42 - see when a network is actually providing
04:44 - real value based on the security
04:46 - features different types of nodes that
04:48 - they have
04:49 - Etc so obviously I could go into some
04:51 - more depth here but the general concept
04:53 - is you want to understand even at kind
04:55 - of like a mathematical level what is a
04:57 - proof of work what does that actually
04:58 - mean what is a minor how do you mine a
05:01 - block how are blocks formed I send a
05:03 - transaction to the network to send you
05:05 - one Bitcoin what is that Transaction
05:07 - what is that actually composed of how do
05:09 - I create that what is a digital
05:11 - signature what is a hash function that's
05:13 - the kind of stuff that you would want to
05:15 - learn in this section and of course it's
05:16 - all taught on blockchain Expert
05:23 - so now moving on to section number two
05:25 - once you understand this core Theory and
05:27 - you have a really good understanding of
05:29 - how blockchain networks operate and kind
05:31 - of the importance of decentralization
05:33 - and the security that it provides you
05:35 - want to start looking more into specific
05:37 - blockchain networks like ethereum and
05:39 - learning about decentralized
05:41 - applications so in that first section
05:43 - for example you could have just learned
05:44 - about Bitcoin and kind of what the
05:45 - Bitcoin network does however smart
05:48 - contract development is kind of a whole
05:50 - separate section outside of just
05:52 - blockchain networks and you want to
05:54 - understand uh what is meant by say
05:55 - Turing complete so a language like
05:58 - salinity or a platform like ethereum is
06:00 - Turing complete what that means is that
06:02 - it can support smart contracts and smart
06:04 - contracts are essentially code that are
06:06 - sitting on the blockchain that follow
06:08 - the same properties of the blockchain
06:10 - right they're immutable they're
06:11 - decentralized they're publicly available
06:13 - and you can interact with them and
06:15 - create applications using either one or
06:18 - multiple smart contracts so you want to
06:20 - obviously understand what that is and
06:22 - how that works then you want to start
06:24 - looking into tokens nfts all of that
06:26 - kind of stuff so what is an erc20 token
06:29 - uh what is a peg right when a token is
06:31 - kind of paid to a certain asset what
06:33 - does that mean how do pegs lose their
06:34 - value you want to learn about ERC 721
06:37 - tokens which are nfts right regardless
06:39 - of what you think about them what does
06:41 - it mean for a non-fungible token to
06:43 - exist what does it mean to hold a
06:44 - non-fungible token how do non-fungible
06:47 - tokens prove ownership so that's what I
06:49 - would start looking into here and just
06:51 - kind of understanding what it means to
06:53 - be a token versus be a coin versus Bia
06:55 - ERC 721 token
06:58 - Etc
06:59 - [Music]
07:02 - all right so now that we've got most of
07:04 - the theory out of the way it's time to
07:06 - actually write smart contracts and learn
07:08 - about well creating smart contracts and
07:10 - deploying them on the blockchain now the
07:13 - thing with smart contracts is that this
07:14 - is a very different type of development
07:16 - than writing traditional code that you
07:18 - would run in like python or job
07:19 - JavaScript or any other modern
07:21 - programming language solidities
07:23 - programming syntax is very similar to
07:26 - that of something say like Java however
07:28 - it's a very different kind of way of
07:30 - thinking about structuring code and
07:33 - you're very limited in terms of the
07:34 - number of computations that you can do
07:36 - and what you're actually able to do on
07:38 - the blockchain especially when it comes
07:40 - to data so there's a lot of limitations
07:42 - you're going to have to learn about here
07:44 - and it's worth spending kind of a day or
07:46 - two probably just digging into how does
07:48 - a smart contract work what can a smart
07:50 - contract do what can a smart contract
07:52 - not do and what are the different
07:53 - operations that a smart contract kind of
07:56 - gets invoked by so you have to imagine a
07:58 - smart contract is sitting on the
07:59 - blockchain and unlike Cody may be
08:02 - running on a centralized server it's not
08:04 - like listening for events it can't kind
08:06 - of react to something happening like it
08:08 - can't react to an HTTP call or some data
08:12 - changing in another smart contract what
08:14 - needs to happen is you need to manually
08:16 - invoke this by sending a transaction now
08:18 - when you send a transaction the smart
08:20 - contract can handle the transaction by
08:22 - running a specific function and it can
08:24 - then perform some action which May
08:26 - update some state it may send you some
08:28 - ethereum for example it can do a whole
08:30 - bunch of stuff but it's only going to do
08:32 - that when you send a transaction now
08:34 - another way that you can kind of use a
08:36 - Smart contract is through something
08:37 - known as a call now a call is a
08:40 - read-only operation where you call into
08:43 - the contract and you read information
08:44 - about it you read State that's stored in
08:47 - the contract so you have to understand
08:48 - the difference between a transaction and
08:50 - a call now continuing when we talk about
08:52 - State and storage that's when you get
08:54 - into the different storage locations of
08:56 - a spark contract so a smart contract
08:58 - stores data on the blockchain some
09:00 - permanent some not permanent right so
09:03 - your permanent data is stored in what's
09:05 - referred to as storage or state now this
09:08 - is a very expensive but permanent and
09:10 - secure location to store data and when
09:12 - you do a smart contract call typically
09:14 - you're reading the state from that smart
09:16 - contract and when you do a transaction
09:18 - you're paying gas which is your fee to
09:21 - essentially update that state or change
09:23 - it in some way hopefully that makes a
09:25 - little bit of sense but that's kind of
09:27 - the basics on state now beyond that you
09:29 - would have memory call data and the
09:31 - stack which are your other storage
09:33 - locations which of course you have to
09:34 - learn about and understand how they work
09:36 - beyond that you're going to have to look
09:37 - at stuff like visibility modifiers so in
09:40 - solidity just like in a language like
09:41 - job about you're going to have your
09:43 - internal external private and public
09:45 - visibility modifiers that you can use on
09:48 - functions variables Etc you're also
09:50 - going to have to look at the limitations
09:51 - on executions so a smart contract cannot
09:55 - run for an hour right it can't do 10
09:57 - billion operations you're very limited
09:59 - in what you can actually do and there's
10:01 - some computations that you just cannot
10:03 - perform or that you have to perform over
10:05 - multiple transactions because you can't
10:07 - send enough gas which is kind of the
10:09 - fuel that's used for operations on the
10:11 - blockchain to kind of be executed and
10:13 - performed for example if you try to do
10:14 - say 10 000 iterations of a for Loop most
10:17 - likely your transaction is going to fail
10:19 - you can't even do that many so in terms
10:22 - of writing code you have to be very
10:23 - careful how you do that and really think
10:25 - about the way in which your smart
10:27 - contract works now of course we then get
10:29 - into security if you're going to be
10:31 - sending funds to a Smart contract which
10:32 - can happen a smart contract can hold
10:34 - money just like any other say ethereum
10:36 - address you have to think about okay how
10:38 - am I going to get these out is it just
10:39 - the deployer of the contract that gets
10:41 - this month money how do other people get
10:43 - this money how do I avoid exploits how
10:45 - do I make sure that people can actually
10:46 - get the money out all kinds of different
10:49 - considerations and again all of this
10:51 - kind of stuff you have to learn right
10:53 - and you can learn this from blockchain
10:54 - expert of course
11:00 - all right so moving on from what I was
11:01 - going to call kind of the solidity
11:02 - fundamentals or a smart contract
11:04 - fundamentals which would be our last
11:06 - section now you have more advanced smart
11:08 - contract development now when you get
11:10 - into this section you're learning more
11:11 - about kind of arithmetic limitations of
11:13 - smart contracts overflows underflows how
11:16 - to do like fixed Point math even though
11:18 - it's not really like a possible thing
11:20 - you can do but kind of there's ways
11:22 - around it in solidity and smart
11:24 - contracts you're going to be learning
11:25 - about stuff like modifiers structs
11:28 - enumerations inheritance libraries
11:31 - interfaces and more advanced kind of
11:33 - let's call them object-oriented style
11:35 - Concepts inside of solidity once you
11:38 - learn these kind of more advanced
11:40 - solidity features you're going to be at
11:41 - a point where you understand most of the
11:44 - solidity programming language it's not
11:45 - overly complicated language and then it
11:47 - gets down to actually practicing a bunch
11:49 - and making sure that you're kind of
11:51 - verifying your knowledge right which is
11:53 - why a platform like blockchain expert
11:54 - would be great with all the practice
11:56 - questions assessment questions and full
11:58 - projects to make sure you actually
11:59 - understand what's going on now at this
12:02 - point you're also going to realize that
12:03 - there's so many different solidity
12:04 - versions and information you're getting
12:06 - from the internet most likely is
12:08 - outdated versus the newest solidity
12:10 - version so you have to be very careful
12:12 - where you're getting your information
12:13 - from because a year ago or two years ago
12:15 - what you could do with that solidity
12:17 - compiler version is much different than
12:19 - what you can do with this solidity
12:21 - compiler version and kind of limitations
12:22 - and what's now best practices so that's
12:25 - why again I'm going to keep plugging it
12:27 - something like blockchain expert is a
12:28 - great resource because everything there
12:30 - is correct it's up to date with the
12:31 - current version and you're not going to
12:34 - be kind of finding incorrect data on
12:36 - that site
12:39 - [Music]
12:41 - all right so at this point you now
12:43 - understand how to write a smart contract
12:45 - you understand things like gas
12:47 - transactions calls the different storage
12:49 - locations some Advanced solidity
12:51 - features and you should be comfortable
12:52 - writing smart contracts understanding
12:54 - the logic within them and using kind of
12:57 - more advanced solidity features now that
12:59 - you know this what really comes next is
13:01 - actually being able to utilize your
13:02 - smart contract in some kind of
13:03 - meaningful way at this point you've just
13:05 - been able to do kind of simple tests
13:07 - with it you haven't been writing a real
13:08 - application and now you need to learn
13:10 - how to interact with smart contracts now
13:14 - in a course like blockchain expert we
13:15 - teach you how to do this with JavaScript
13:17 - because that's typically where you're
13:18 - going to be doing it especially if
13:19 - you're writing a front end however you
13:21 - want to understand how to query the
13:23 - blockchain how do I look at for example
13:25 - events which can be emitted by smart
13:28 - contracts how do I get the most
13:29 - up-to-date state from a smart contract
13:31 - how do I use the getter methods
13:33 - associated with it and how do I take
13:34 - on-chain data and bring that off chain
13:37 - and process that and present that and do
13:39 - something with that so that's what this
13:41 - kind of section is about and there's all
13:43 - kinds of libraries for example like
13:45 - ethers that can help you do this so you
13:47 - need to learn some kind of framework or
13:49 - some kind of interacting with smart
13:51 - contracts method again there's a lot of
13:53 - ways to do this and you can do this kind
13:55 - of in a raw format if you're using
13:57 - something like Json RPC calls however
13:59 - you can also just pick up a library like
14:01 - ethers if you're working in something
14:02 - like JavaScript and kind of learn the
14:05 - methods and whatnot that it has
14:06 - associated with it of course all your
14:08 - popular programming languages are going
14:10 - to have let's call them kind of apis or
14:12 - wrappers around a blockchain network
14:14 - like ethereum or Bitcoin but you want to
14:16 - learn how to use those and this
14:18 - shouldn't take you too long to do
14:21 - [Music]
14:23 - now once you've learned how to interact
14:25 - with smart contracts the next section we
14:28 - move into is web 3 tools you want to
14:30 - learn professional development tools and
14:32 - how you can actually kind of write smart
14:34 - contracts and decentralized applications
14:36 - at scale so it is very inefficient and
14:39 - not cost effective to have to be using
14:41 - for example a uh ethereum test Network
14:44 - or the actual theory of main network if
14:46 - you're trying to test smart contracts or
14:48 - decentralized applications so you want
14:50 - to be learning about something like hard
14:51 - hat which is kind of a uh what's called
14:54 - a development tool that you can use to
14:56 - test your smart contracts locally as
14:58 - well as to run a local blockchain
15:00 - network which you can get kind of
15:01 - unlimited let's call it ether on and
15:04 - kind of mess around with right so you
15:05 - want to learn about those more advanced
15:07 - tools how do I deploy to my local
15:09 - network how do I test locally before
15:11 - deploying my smart contract to a main
15:13 - Network how do I protect my private keys
15:15 - and make sure that I'm not leaking any
15:16 - of that and just kind of the best
15:18 - practices when it comes to web3
15:20 - developer tools now once you've done
15:22 - web3 develop developer tools now you're
15:24 - at the point where you know really
15:26 - everything there is about blockchain and
15:28 - blockchain development as I said this is
15:31 - not actually an overwhelming amount of
15:32 - content it's pretty digestible in a few
15:34 - months
15:37 - [Music]
15:39 - now once you're at that point and maybe
15:42 - even before you get to that point you
15:43 - want to start working on projects right
15:45 - full decentralized applications where
15:47 - you take everything you just learned and
15:48 - you apply that in one now applications I
15:51 - like to build are stuff like kind of an
15:53 - nft token for example an erc20 token I
15:56 - like to create you know some kind of
15:58 - bank accounts these are kind of your
15:59 - classical projects but then you want to
16:01 - work on stuff that's a bit more
16:02 - complicated so maybe you want to do like
16:04 - some kind of auction for example in
16:05 - blockchain expert we build an nft
16:07 - auction you may want to do a
16:09 - decentralized voting protocol which is
16:10 - another thing that we do in blockchain
16:12 - expert you may want to be working with
16:13 - an oracle an oracle is something like
16:15 - chain link that allows you to take
16:17 - off-chain data and put that onto the
16:20 - chain so that your smart contracts can
16:21 - react to for example the score in a
16:24 - World Cup game or something like that
16:25 - and you could do maybe a bet on the
16:27 - blockchain that actually is triggered by
16:29 - something that happens off the
16:30 - blockchain so there's all kinds of cool
16:32 - stuff like this and you want to start
16:33 - working on full decentralized
16:35 - applications that have a secure back-end
