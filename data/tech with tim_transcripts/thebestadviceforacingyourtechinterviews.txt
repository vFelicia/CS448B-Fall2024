00:00 - I've passed technical interviews at both
00:01 - Microsoft and Shopify and helped
00:03 - thousands of other people do the same
00:05 - and here are my top tips for acing your
00:07 - interview number one is to be prepared
00:09 - and to be confident the best way to walk
00:12 - into your interview with that confidence
00:13 - with a little bit of arrogance is to
00:15 - actually be prepared and to have done
00:17 - all of the work and be sure that when
00:19 - you're walking in there you're as
00:20 - prepared as you ever could be step
00:22 - number two is to make sure you
00:24 - articulate your entire thought process
00:25 - even if you're not quite sure about how
00:27 - to solve a problem walk your interviewer
00:29 - through how you're thinking about it
00:31 - this is very advantageous as they can
00:33 - help give you hints and they can see
00:34 - where you're kind of going right and
00:35 - where you're going wrong next make sure
00:37 - you ask questions if you're unsure about
00:39 - the problem if they didn't explain it
00:40 - well feel free to ask them feel free to
00:43 - kind of debate with them and kind of run
00:44 - solutions by them and see what leeway
00:47 - They're Gonna Give You Now lastly is to
00:49 - start simple and get more complicated
00:50 - break the problem down understand the
00:52 - most basic solution that's brute force
00:55 - and then go on and start optimizing it
00:57 - and get more complex
