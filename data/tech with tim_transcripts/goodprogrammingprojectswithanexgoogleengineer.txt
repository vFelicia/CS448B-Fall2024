00:00 - hey guys and welcome back so it's a
00:02 - super exciting video because this is the
00:04 - first ever collaborative video on my
00:06 - channel and what I'm going to be doing
00:07 - here is essentially talking about what
00:09 - makes a great programming project with
00:12 - an X Google engineer so we're gonna be
00:14 - here with Clements I'm sure some of you
00:15 - guys have heard of his channel but he
00:16 - has an awesome YouTube channel it talks
00:18 - about entrepreneurship software
00:20 - engineering how to get a job as you know
00:22 - an Internet is a full-time position at
00:23 - one of these large tech companies and
00:25 - I've really tried my best to extract as
00:27 - much knowledge from him as possible
00:29 - you'll notice that I kind of try to sit
00:30 - back a little bit through what I call a
00:32 - little interview our discussion here
00:34 - because I really want to get you know
00:35 - his expertise and his knowledge and
00:37 - share that with you guys so anyways I
00:38 - hope you guys enjoy this video if you do
00:40 - smash a like go check out Clements
00:43 - channel he has an awesome you know I I
00:44 - watch it all the time it's great and
00:46 - anyways let's get into the video and you
00:48 - know hear about what makes a great
00:49 - programming project hey Tim thanks for
00:51 - having me yeah I'm really excited to be
00:53 - here my name is cl√©ment Klem for short
00:55 - and I've been a software engineer at
00:58 - Google at Facebook now I'm working
01:00 - full-time on my company algo expert algo
01:03 - exper do it's a coding interview prep
01:05 - platform and I also have a YouTube
01:07 - channel awesome okay sweet so yeah on
01:11 - your YouTube channel I mean I've
01:12 - actually been a kind of a low-key fan of
01:14 - your channel watching some of the videos
01:15 - you just talks about like software
01:17 - engineering and just some really cool
01:18 - interesting topics I definitely
01:20 - recommend that you guys go over there
01:22 - and check that out
01:22 - and also I've been using algo expert
01:25 - which is Clem's kind of product I guess
01:27 - your what a co-founder of it right yep
01:29 - yep so you know if you guys want to use
01:32 - that product I do have a 15% discount
01:33 - code its tech with Tim there's also a
01:35 - link in the description I have some
01:37 - videos going through when I've used it
01:38 - but a genuine is a really great tool and
01:40 - you know I've done a video on Clem's
01:42 - channel you guys will see where a live
01:44 - coding interview and kind of the reason
01:46 - for my maybe success and that is because
01:48 - of using algo expert but it was enough
01:50 - of that let's get into this so the first
01:52 - question I want to ask you is do you
01:54 - need a ton of projects on your kind of
01:56 - programming coding resume I see people
01:58 - all the time asking how many I do I need
02:00 - you know how great do they have to be so
02:02 - do you need a tunner is one enough
02:03 - that's a good question and I think that
02:06 - the answer unfortunately is it depends
02:09 - there is no right answer or rather no
02:12 - clear
02:12 - answer I think the main thing that it
02:14 - depends on is the amount of work
02:16 - experience or internship experience that
02:19 - you have if you have a lot of work
02:22 - experience you probably don't need that
02:24 - many projects in fact I'd say the more
02:26 - senior you get the fewer projects you
02:28 - need the more junior you are so if
02:30 - you're straight out of college the more
02:32 - projects you need if you have no work
02:35 - experience whatsoever and even no
02:37 - internship experience which is the
02:38 - position that I was in when I applied to
02:41 - Google cuz I had kind of a weird you
02:44 - know experience with colleagues where I
02:47 - didn't do a computer science degree I
02:49 - had no internship experience and then I
02:51 - did a coding bootcamp right out of
02:52 - college but since I had no work
02:55 - experience relevant to software
02:56 - engineering I ended up having four
02:59 - software engineering projects on my
03:01 - resume and I think four would be a good
03:02 - number for someone who has no experience
03:04 - no internship experience if you have
03:07 - like one internship maybe you only need
03:09 - two good projects or three good projects
03:12 - if you have two years of work experience
03:14 - you probably only need one project and
03:16 - then if you have more than that maybe
03:18 - you no longer need then at that point
03:20 - awesome so it sounds like really you
03:22 - know if you have more experience that
03:23 - kind of shows what skillset you already
03:25 - have whereas if you're coming in kind of
03:26 - fresh or you're coming right out of
03:27 - school the more projects can really
03:29 - demonstrate you know what you know right
03:31 - whereas you might not have that
03:32 - experience to fall back on awesome yeah
03:35 - I would even say because I recently
03:37 - chatted with a Google recruiter and she
03:39 - put this in a good way where a project
03:42 - is really meant to show to people that
03:45 - you are passionate about software
03:47 - engineering that you have skills
03:49 - demonstrably skills you're able to build
03:51 - stuff you know and that's really useful
03:55 - if you don't have work experience but
03:57 - then if you have work experience then
03:58 - you need you you don't need to prove
04:01 - that as much if that makes sense for
04:03 - sure that makes a ton of sense I think
04:04 - everyone kind of understands that
04:06 - awesome so I mean you talked about
04:08 - passion which is actually something I
04:10 - wanted to ask these projects is it
04:12 - important that these projects come from
04:14 - outside of school or is it okay to kind
04:16 - of highlight you know two or three
04:17 - really good group projects or school
04:19 - projects that you worked on kind of
04:20 - weird what's the balance between you
04:22 - know some stuff outside of school to
04:23 - really show the your passion and you are
04:25 - you know taking
04:26 - to make the projects and the school
04:28 - project if that makes any sense like
04:29 - what holds you know higher ground does
04:31 - it matter if it's just school project
04:33 - should you have a mix of both
04:34 - your thoughts on that maybe yeah and
04:37 - again here I would say it really depends
04:39 - okay I think that ideally a mix of both
04:42 - could be really good and the reason I
04:45 - think college projects for school
04:47 - projects might be really good is because
04:49 - typically those projects tend to be
04:50 - class projects or team projects rather
04:52 - and that can be a good thing to show
04:54 - that you're able to work as part of a
04:56 - team two small caveats there if you do
04:59 - have team projects that you're sewing
05:01 - make sure to really highlight the work
05:04 - that you did maybe you can you can word
05:07 - your resume or your description of the
05:09 - project in a way that really conveys
05:11 - that you were part of a team and you
05:13 - handled all of the back end for instance
05:15 - or maybe you were the the direction
05:18 - giver of the project does that make
05:20 - sense yes the other caveat is that you
05:23 - probably don't want only team projects
05:26 - it's probably good to have at least one
05:27 - or two projects that you just did all by
05:30 - yourself from scratch to have a nice
05:32 - balance there okay awesome yeah so I
05:35 - think that makes a lot of sense so
05:36 - really just you know if you have a group
05:38 - project on they're highlighting exactly
05:39 - what you did in the project cuz it's one
05:41 - thing to just slap one on especially
05:43 - when we know you know people in group
05:44 - projects one person typically ends up
05:46 - doing a lot of the work right
05:48 - and then just showing some individual
05:49 - projects to to really show that you know
05:51 - your passion and that this is what you
05:52 - can do on your own it's not just in a
05:54 - group right but then just just one more
05:57 - thing that I would add here is that like
05:59 - ultimately you really have to ask
06:00 - yourself what is the goal of a software
06:02 - engineering project on your resume like
06:04 - we just said before it's to show to your
06:06 - recruiters or potential hiring managers
06:09 - that you have demonstrably skills you
06:12 - have passion and all that if you are
06:15 - really really proud of a couple of class
06:18 - projects or even multiple yeah more than
06:20 - two may be the only projects that are
06:22 - proud of are the ones that you did as
06:24 - part of the team in the class then so be
06:26 - it just go with those right you're just
06:28 - trying to sell yourself as best as
06:30 - possible so even though I think the
06:33 - recommendation would be a nice balance
06:34 - of the two
06:35 - go with what sells you best if that
06:38 - makes sense
06:39 - for sure you have to make sure that you
06:41 - know you really liked the project and if
06:43 - that gets brought up you can talk about
06:44 - skills that you applied in the project
06:46 - and you know it's a great kind of
06:48 - starter question it's a great like
06:50 - leeway into what you did and your skill
06:52 - set right awesome okay so I think
06:54 - another question I get asked this a lot
06:56 - too people say how complex does my
06:59 - project need to be to put it on a resume
07:00 - like if I have something that's you know
07:01 - maybe kind of medium level not super
07:04 - crazy complex maybe not a massive like
07:06 - thousand line coat can I put it on or do
07:08 - I need to be showing stuff that's like
07:09 - really impressive really amazing is okay
07:11 - to have a few kind of simple projects
07:13 - that demonstrate some skills or do they
07:15 - need to be you know crazy one massive
07:17 - project right yeah so I think that here
07:20 - again you have to first remember what
07:24 - you're trying to accomplish with these
07:26 - projects and the context around your
07:29 - application so if you're a college
07:31 - student for instance you are not going
07:33 - to be expected to have built an app with
07:36 - millions of downloads or website with
07:39 - millions of customers or thousands of
07:41 - customers right so that's one thing from
07:43 - that point of view you should not feel
07:44 - discouraged if your project is kind of
07:47 - you trivial in a way or not legit in a
07:50 - way because it's not expected if that
07:52 - makes sense
07:53 - the second thing is as far as complexity
07:56 - complexity is very ambiguous and
07:59 - subjective first of all what really
08:02 - makes a project complex is it the
08:05 - technical complexity is that the
08:08 - products complexity you know getting
08:10 - everyone together if it was a team
08:12 - project so that's something that can be
08:13 - difficult to to measure so I wouldn't
08:16 - worry too much on having something
08:17 - that's hyper complex and then the third
08:20 - thing which now I guess goes into what
08:23 - makes a project good yeah I would say
08:26 - that more than complexity you want a
08:30 - project that a recruiter or a hiring
08:32 - manager or a software engineer reading
08:34 - your resume is going to be able to grasp
08:36 - very quickly and is gonna be impressed
08:40 - by at a glance and again that doesn't
08:43 - necessarily translate into the most
08:45 - technically complex project if I look at
08:48 - examples of my projects I have a video
08:50 - on my youtube channel that you know my
08:52 - software engineering projects
08:53 - my most technically complex project was
08:57 - like creating a sort of basic
09:00 - programming language and an interpreter
09:02 - for it
09:03 - it wasn't very visual or very easily
09:07 - graspable and so I don't think it was
09:09 - actually my best project so so I would
09:13 - say you know because be wary of
09:14 - complexity basically that's so that's
09:16 - sort of what I'm getting at for sure so
09:18 - it sounds like you need to make sure
09:20 - this project almost kind of sells itself
09:22 - right like if they read through it and
09:23 - they hear the title they're gonna
09:25 - understand exactly you know what went
09:26 - into the project what was involved that
09:29 - whereas if it you have a very
09:30 - technically complex project it could be
09:31 - hard to kind of demonstrate why that was
09:34 - so complex right and you know you might
09:36 - not get as much credit for it because
09:38 - the interview or the recruiter looking
09:39 - at it doesn't understand what you had to
09:41 - do for that project whereas you have
09:42 - something more visual and I think you
09:44 - had a project we did like some sorting
09:46 - and some searching algorithm
09:47 - visualization I know when I looked at
09:49 - that it looked really impressive
09:51 - immediately just because of all the
09:53 - visuals right and I think that's a good
09:55 - probably point that you brought up to
09:56 - make sure that your projects you know
09:58 - people can understand kind of what's
10:00 - gone into them maybe there is some
10:01 - visual components and it's appealing to
10:03 - a recruiter someone reading through like
10:05 - to understand what it is by your brief
10:07 - description right so is that that's
10:08 - coming exactly out for that exactly and
10:11 - I saw your recent video on projects that
10:14 - you can spin up or develop in a week
10:16 - yeah and I think that in that video a
10:18 - really good example of a project was the
10:20 - very first one you had the pseudo coup
10:22 - solder the reason that was a good
10:23 - project in my opinion is because putting
10:26 - a sign of the fact that like you said
10:27 - you can develop that in a weekend
10:29 - basically but it's very easy to explain
10:33 - to someone it's a you you wrote an
10:35 - algorithm that solves a pseudo coup
10:37 - board and the majority of people know
10:38 - what pseudo who is if they don't you can
10:40 - briefly describe pseudo who is a puzzle
10:42 - like game that is difficult to solve for
10:44 - human beings you know something like
10:46 - that and you learn algorithm that solves
10:47 - it but then you also added that visual
10:49 - component the GUI the graphical user
10:52 - interface for it right that's actually
10:54 - super important because suddenly this
10:56 - project that was otherwise very
10:58 - understandable at least you know in
11:01 - writing but not necessarily visual
11:04 - suddenly you actually have something
11:06 - that some
11:07 - can interact with and really there they
11:09 - immediately grasp it it's complex enough
11:12 - you know you don't need to have way
11:14 - fancier algorithm and you've got a great
11:17 - project yeah so that I think that really
11:19 - ties it all together right so if you
11:21 - guys haven't seen that video leave a
11:22 - link or card so you can check out what
11:24 - that project is but essentially it just
11:26 - is you can play the game of Sudoku and
11:28 - then you can actually view the
11:29 - backtracking algorithm that I used to
11:31 - solve it going through and solving it
11:32 - step-by-step and creating those visuals
11:35 - can be you know an extra add-on but it
11:37 - really is not that difficult it takes an
11:39 - extra few hours and it really kind of
11:41 - highlights
11:41 - well the complex thing what goes into
11:43 - the project it allows someone to just
11:44 - quickly easily even if they don't know
11:46 - much about programming to see it and
11:47 - understand it yeah so that's a great
11:49 - point come ok so here's some shorter
11:51 - questions maybe do interviewers look at
11:54 - your source code like your github
11:57 - repositories and that's a good question
11:59 - I don't have the answer to that question
12:02 - mainly because I haven't seen what
12:04 - happens behind the scenes at least when
12:06 - I was applying I would say that in the
12:09 - majority of cases they won't for
12:12 - instance you're applying to a big tech
12:13 - company like Google or Amazon I highly
12:17 - doubt that a recruiter is certainly not
12:19 - a recruiter because a recruiter is not
12:21 - meant to be technical they don't need to
12:23 - know how to code but even an engineer I
12:25 - highly doubt that an engineer is gonna
12:27 - look at your github code for instance
12:29 - they might you know that you might have
12:31 - a couple people who will go poking
12:33 - around it but unlikely in a smaller
12:35 - start-up maybe that's more likely
12:38 - because there they might be hiring you
12:40 - almost less on potential and more on
12:43 - your you know objective skills and
12:46 - abilities and there they might be more
12:49 - like hmm does this person actually know
12:51 - how to write JavaScript because we're
12:52 - gonna need them to write JavaScript
12:53 - immediately you know but overall hard to
12:56 - say okay so I think that's a good answer
12:59 - I mean I just want a lot of people ask
13:01 - me you know does my code have to be
13:02 - crisp clean there's enough to be amazing
13:04 - and I think that kind of helps answer
13:06 - the question you should do as good at
13:08 - the job as you can but you know if you
13:10 - need to get the project out and put it
13:11 - on your resume chances are if you're
13:12 - applying at a larger company it's less
13:14 - likely they're gonna look at and just
13:16 - from a time sake as well it makes sense
13:18 - right it's hard to look through six
13:19 - different programming projects on each
13:21 - May and read through the source code and
13:22 - see what's going on right in the so
13:24 - exact course austere best you know write
13:27 - good code but don't make it necessarily
13:29 - like you know it doesn't have to be the
13:30 - best production code in the world ok
13:33 - great so that's that's great ok so you
13:36 - know you have these projects you go into
13:38 - a resume our arrest me you go into an
13:40 - interview and you know they're kind of
13:41 - going through your resume and they're
13:42 - asking questions what should you really
13:44 - touch on in your projects and we already
13:46 - we talked about this before but I really
13:48 - want to hammer it in so someone that's
13:49 - going to an interview and they you know
13:50 - they have these projects to discuss what
13:52 - should they really talk about what's the
13:54 - thing that they should focus on that's
13:56 - gonna be most impressive and you know
13:57 - lead to potentially getting hired just
13:59 - because of some of the stuff from their
14:01 - projects if that question makes any
14:02 - sense yeah so ideally lead with your
14:06 - best foot forward meaning if you have a
14:08 - project that you're really passionate
14:10 - about and you think it's the most
14:12 - impressive make sure that it's
14:13 - highlighted on your resume as the first
14:15 - project or something like that because
14:17 - an interviewer is likely gonna look at
14:19 - the first one and ask you about that one
14:21 - and if they ask you just arbitrarily
14:24 - tell me about a project you worked on
14:25 - obviously talk about the one that you're
14:27 - more comfortable with or that you think
14:29 - is more impressive and then have some
14:32 - sort of 30-second pitch for the project
14:36 - it's almost like if you take a look at
14:37 - entrepreneurship right when you have a
14:39 - company and you're pitching the company
14:40 - and you want to be able to explain it to
14:41 - someone who has no idea what the company
14:44 - is in a word or in a sentence same thing
14:47 - for the project if you need to spend
14:49 - three minutes giving me the backstory
14:53 - behind your project so that I can even
14:54 - start understanding it that's not good
14:57 - right so yeah as an example take your
14:59 - your pseudo COO project the way that I
15:02 - would probably say it and you know 20
15:04 - seconds you go hey are you familiar with
15:06 - the pseudo kupaza --ls yes no and you
15:08 - explain what it is depending on the
15:10 - answer there and then you say okay I
15:11 - wrote I I did a project where I wrote an
15:13 - algorithm that solves the pseudo coup
15:15 - and I wrote an interface for it where
15:17 - you can actually solve the Sudoku as you
15:19 - go through it and see the algorithm
15:21 - working giving you hints or tell you if
15:23 - it's correct and then you you know you
15:24 - can say hey if you want I can show it to
15:26 - you boom you've explained it in ten
15:28 - seconds
15:28 - they know what it is and then you can
15:31 - follow the conversation if they want to
15:32 - ask you more about it
15:34 - great I think that's great advice for
15:36 - everyone you know take make sure that
15:39 - whatever you're doing you know you can
15:40 - explain that quickly right so someone
15:42 - that's not so technical or even just in
15:44 - like maybe a behavioral interview if you
15:45 - get asked about something like that
15:47 - right that you can really easily explain
15:48 - it so if you're going in make sure that
15:50 - if you list all these projects on your
15:52 - resume you know how you're gonna
15:53 - summarize them to someone who's never
15:55 - seen the source code are never seeing
15:56 - what it looks like before so that's
15:58 - definitely great advice and the last
15:59 - question what which I think is gonna be
16:01 - actually fairly interesting I'm excited
16:03 - to know the answer what is the most
16:05 - impressive or maybe just the coolest
16:07 - project you've ever seen on someone's
16:10 - resume when you're like looking at I'm I
16:12 - know you do the technical interview so
16:13 - I'm not sure how many resumes you've had
16:14 - a chance to look at what's the most
16:16 - impressive one you've seen you know
16:17 - coming in from someone who's trying to
16:19 - get a job yeah and so here you know for
16:23 - all of those of you who are who are
