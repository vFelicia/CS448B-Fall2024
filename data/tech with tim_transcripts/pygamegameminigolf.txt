00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:02 - YouTube video so in today's video I'm
00:05 - gonna be showing you something that I
00:07 - made in Python so it's gonna be a little
00:08 - bit different usually I do tutorials or
00:10 - how-to videos but today I'm just gonna
00:13 - be showcasing one of the programs that I
00:14 - made now Python is a great language you
00:18 - can do a lot with it and the reason I'm
00:19 - showing you this is because a lot of
00:20 - people think that Python is a beginner's
00:22 - language or just an intermediate
00:23 - language and once you get advanced you
00:25 - can't really use it for that many things
00:27 - which is definitely not true now
00:29 - especially with game development
00:31 - obviously there are better languages in
00:33 - Python but you can go pretty far and if
00:35 - you aren't subscribed to my channel then
00:37 - you won't know that I've been doing a PI
00:39 - game programming series where I've been
00:41 - showing you guys how to program a pretty
00:43 - simple game using Python and the module
00:45 - PI game now this program here that I'm
00:48 - using does use PI game and that's the
00:50 - main like GUI for it it's all in PI game
00:54 - there's a little bit of tkinter but not
00:55 - that much and this is what my main
00:57 - script looks like it's about a thousand
01:00 - lines and I have four other files so
01:02 - combined we probably have about 3500
01:05 - 4000 lines in this game just to give you
01:07 - guys an idea so this is fairly advanced
01:09 - and again if you guys want to see a
01:12 - tutorial on this or something like this
01:15 - then let me know in the comments down
01:17 - below I will warn you that I do use some
01:20 - like advanced physics and some pretty
01:23 - advanced math in this so if you're not
01:24 - into that then you might not want to see
01:27 - a tutorial in this as it is pretty
01:29 - complex but I'll go ahead and demo the
01:31 - game for you guys right now so if we run
01:33 - the program here
01:34 - you can see we've got super mini golf by
01:38 - me and then we have coins up here which
01:41 - is going to be zero and then the ball
01:43 - shop and your best score so if I go over
01:46 - here this is just one course you could
01:49 - possibly add multiple courses into this
01:51 - I just haven't done that yet in the ball
01:54 - shop we have all the different colored
01:55 - balls and pretty much based on the coins
01:57 - that you collect in the game you can buy
01:59 - different balls and then you can equip
02:01 - them from here so I'm gonna equip the
02:02 - green ball right now and I'm gonna go
02:04 - ahead and I'm gonna start running the
02:06 - program now you should hear a little bit
02:08 - of background noise I have some music
02:10 - going on
02:11 - and you can see you have a little coin
02:12 - spinning I have a little power bar down
02:14 - here and I can shoot this ball around so
02:17 - pretty much the ball just follows my
02:19 - mouse like this and if I click look in
02:22 - the bottom left corner you can see the
02:23 - power bar go and then my ball will
02:26 - launch basically wherever I shoot it now
02:28 - right now the coin collision is not
02:30 - working just because I had to turn it
02:32 - off as I was testing something via and
02:34 - then if we go to the top right up here I
02:37 - can see we have our power ups and I have
02:40 - so this is power ball this is Mulligan
02:43 - which means like take your shot again
02:44 - and this is sticky ball so say for
02:46 - example I put sticky ball on and let's
02:48 - try to land it somewhere then the ball
02:51 - will stick directly where it is shot too
02:54 - so all of this is uh all these graphics
02:57 - you can tell are just designed by me by
02:59 - hand I know they're horrible but I just
03:02 - wanted something easy to use and
03:03 - something that I could get the right
03:05 - dimensions for these power-ups are
03:07 - inspired by an app on the App Store it's
03:09 - called super stickman mini go that I
03:11 - used to play all the time so I kind of
03:12 - modeled this game after it and there we
03:15 - go so I get it in and now we are brought
03:17 - to the to the score sheet after this so
03:21 - you can see we have the part of the
03:22 - course I just made this 9 holes and then
03:24 - it's gonna show you your whole the part
03:26 - and then how well you show so since I
03:29 - shot for you a little green and changing
03:31 - my score on the hole so I'm just gonna
03:33 - click to continue and now we're on the
03:36 - next level now it is a little bit
03:37 - glitchy sometimes the game especially
03:39 - because I didn't make it on this
03:41 - computer I made it on a different
03:41 - computer so sometimes it doesn't always
03:44 - work perfectly but we'll go ahead and
03:46 - we'll shoot the ball and I'm not gonna
03:49 - play all of the levels because it will
03:50 - take a little bit of time but you can
03:52 - see how it works so if I get in the
03:53 - water
03:54 - we get water hazard plus one stroke and
03:56 - hopefully you guys are noticing the way
03:58 - that the ball moves is in like a perfect
04:01 - parabola conic because there's no wind
04:03 - resistance no air resistance and it just
04:06 - works like it would work in physics so
04:10 - again I she's the power shot there to
04:12 - get up but you said I didn't like that
04:14 - shot I could just click little m button
04:15 - here and then it would take me back to
04:17 - my last position and remove whatever
04:19 - strokes I gained from that last shot so
04:21 - we'll go back to Power Shot here
04:24 - we launched ourselves up and then again
04:27 - once we get on the green here what
04:28 - happens is you get into pudding mode
04:30 - which means that you can only shoot in a
04:32 - straight line towards the hole and all
04:34 - you have to do is just set your power ah
04:36 - and then it works like that so I don't
04:40 - know guys can let me know what you think
04:41 - of the game down below yeah so not when
04:44 - I got plus four or CC we get a little
04:46 - red nine and then once you get to the
04:48 - end of the game it's gonna add up all
04:49 - your coins it's gonna add up your score
04:51 - and then if you had a better score than
04:54 - your previous score it's gonna save that
04:56 - and it's gonna show it to you so yeah
04:58 - that's pretty much been the golf game
05:01 - that I made in Python let me know what
05:03 - you guys thought of it down below and
