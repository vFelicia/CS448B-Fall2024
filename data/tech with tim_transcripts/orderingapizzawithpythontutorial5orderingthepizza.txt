00:00 - hello everybody and welcome to the final
00:02 - video and you're ordering a pizza with
00:04 - Python series now in this video I am
00:06 - actually going to be using a modified
00:08 - version of the script that we've made
00:09 - because we're just gonna add some stuff
00:10 - to it to order a pizza to my house and
00:13 - then I will show you guys that I
00:14 - actually get the pizza from using this
00:16 - software now obviously I have to blurred
00:18 - out a lot of the information that we're
00:19 - gonna be using because I can't show you
00:20 - guys you know like my postal code and my
00:23 - address my credit card information and
00:25 - all of that but you know try to believe
00:27 - me I'm gonna be showing you the clock
00:28 - when I order and when I receive so that
00:30 - you guys kind of know that I'm doing
00:32 - this within the same time frame and
00:33 - anyways let's go ahead and get started
00:35 - so the first thing we need to do is
00:37 - figure out how we actually place an
00:38 - order so right now we've got up to the
00:39 - point where we collect credit card
00:40 - information and we you know make the
00:42 - order and find the store but we don't
00:44 - actually know how to place it so into
00:46 - place it's pretty easy we're just gonna
00:47 - copy this code just you order that place
00:49 - card and in my local Domino's tup place
00:51 - order and then the order and the card so
00:54 - I'm gonna go into my script here Evan I
00:56 - just want to remind everyone that what
00:58 - I've done here is changed customer to be
01:00 - console input get new customer that's
01:02 - going to allow the what is it gonna be
01:05 - the console will print out like some
01:07 - prompts for people to insert their
01:08 - information as if they were a new
01:09 - customer so you don't just have to hard
01:11 - code it into here it can be a different
01:13 - customer every time or a different
01:14 - address or whatever you want now we have
01:16 - the menu we show all this stuff so my
01:19 - local dominos done get menu print my
01:22 - local Domino's I'm just gonna add one
01:23 - thing up here print closest store : like
01:30 - that I'll do a backslash N beforehand
01:33 - just so it goes down one line it will
01:35 - show this store and then what I'm gonna
01:36 - do is say print would you like to select
01:39 - this store if they say no we'll just
01:42 - exit the program um otherwise we'll
01:44 - continue
01:45 - so we'll say imports or we'll say like
01:48 - an S equals input would you like to
01:54 - order from this store question mark and
01:58 - we'll just put some brackets and say why
02:00 - n and then what we'll do is we'll say if
02:02 - they don't say wire they don't say yes
02:04 - then we will simply quit the program so
02:06 - we'll say if an s not in
02:09 - and this will be yes and why and we'll
02:13 - just throw this to lower then just print
02:17 - like goodbye or something goodbye oops
02:23 - like that exclamation point and then
02:26 - we'll just quit like that now otherwise
02:28 - then we'll show the menu which we're
02:29 - gonna do here and then we'll go through
02:31 - and we'll do the rest of it now what I'm
02:32 - gonna do here at the end is before I add
02:35 - in this code so ordered up place and my
02:37 - local dominos dot place order I'm
02:39 - actually going to ask the user which
02:41 - I've actually already typed out here I
02:42 - forgot that I put that there if they're
02:44 - gonna be paying cash or credit because
02:45 - there is actually an option to pay with
02:47 - with cash when you order this so we're
02:50 - just gonna ask them if they want cash or
02:51 - credit if they say cash then we won't
02:54 - bother getting their credit card
02:55 - otherwise we will actually ask for it so
02:58 - what I'm gonna say is if payment and
03:02 - notice again like I typed this in and
03:03 - we'll just say dot lower equals equals
03:08 - or actually we'll say if it's in holding
03:11 - of them two options they can type with
03:12 - card or credit card so if it's in that
03:16 - will ask them for their credit card oops
03:18 - I should by going like that
03:20 - otherwise what we'll say is card equals
03:22 - false now you'll see why I'm doing this
03:24 - in a second but that's all we need so
03:28 - then after this what we'll do is we'll
03:30 - ask one last prompt we'll say do you
03:32 - want to place this order like this is
03:33 - final if you place this order you're
03:35 - gonna be paying for it and then if they
03:37 - say yes we'll place it otherwise we
03:38 - won't so we'll say and ask equals input
03:42 - would you like to place this order
03:46 - question mark you can say why no and
03:49 - we'll say if an ask lower in Y or yes
03:55 - then what we'll do is place the order
03:58 - like that so we'll say actually at the
04:00 - end of this we'll say print order placed
04:06 - else we will say print
04:10 - goodbye okay so that's all we need for
04:13 - that now I just want to show you one
04:15 - thing so if we go to order here notice
04:18 - that the reason I was able to say card
04:20 - equals false rather than actually get a
04:22 - credit card information is because
04:23 - inside order if we pass card equals
04:25 - false then what that actually means is
04:27 - we're gonna pay with cash so what this
04:29 - does is a self dot pay with and the card
04:31 - that we pass when we place the order
04:33 - calls this method where it checks if the
04:36 - card is false if the card is false it
04:39 - says the payment method is cash which
04:41 - means that we'll just pick cash when it
04:43 - comes to the door so that's an option as
04:44 - well where we can type in the credit
04:46 - card now last thing note that here the
04:49 - postal code is transforming whenever we
04:52 - type in into a zip code now this isn't
04:54 - gonna work if we're ordering from Canada
04:56 - or someone or somewhere that doesn't
04:58 - have like integer values so I don't know
05:00 - if it's making any sense but essentially
05:01 - my postal code could look something like
05:03 - this right like like that like it could
05:06 - be numbered I think it's like numbers
05:07 - letters numbers I don't know like X like
05:10 - it could be something like that um where
05:12 - it can add letters in it so if I try to
05:13 - convert this into an int that's not
05:14 - gonna work so we have two options we can
05:16 - just type in an invalid zip code which
05:18 - is like type in 0 0 0 or I think we
05:20 - might be able to remove this and just
05:22 - send the actual raw data of whatever
05:24 - that zip code is that we typed in rather
05:26 - than turning it into an int I think that
05:28 - should be okay to do this this might not
05:30 - work if you're in the States I'd
05:31 - recommend you just leave it as in zip
05:33 - but for me since I'm in Canada I'm gonna
05:35 - change it to this so that my postal code
05:36 - will actually work if I decide to use my
05:39 - credit card so that's just something to
05:40 - note if you're actually gonna be doing
05:41 - this look inside of this pay with inside
05:44 - of the order dot Pi file and you might
05:45 - need to mess with this if to change the
05:47 - postal code so that it fits what country
05:49 - you're in there's a lot of stuff that's
05:50 - like country specific that has been
05:52 - programmed in this API and again another
05:54 - reason why we're learning it because we
05:56 - kind of understand you know how it could
05:57 - be issues with it and all of that ok so
06:00 - now that we've done that I think it's
06:02 - actually time to place the order so I'm
06:03 - gonna open up my command prompt type in
06:05 - some of my personal information I'll
06:06 - show you what I order and I'll show you
06:08 - the time and then I'll show you when I
06:09 - actually receive the pizza we'll be
06:11 - right back ok so I've now made my order
06:15 - so all I'm getting is just a ten-inch
06:17 - hand-tossed Canadian pizza to be quite
06:19 - honest I have no idea what's on that but
06:21 - we're just gonna go with it like I'll
06:23 - fine with whatever pizza it is okay so
06:25 - now I'm actually I'm going to insert my
06:27 - credit card information Oh what is this
06:29 - so it's saying well you pay cash or
06:30 - credit so I'm actually gonna decide to
06:31 - pay cash so that way you guys can watch
06:33 - me actually like place this order and
06:35 - see if this works oh let's go cash would
06:37 - you like to place this order yes let's
06:39 - wait and we get an issue okay so let's
06:42 - see what this problem is okay so I have
06:44 - an issue I have an idea that this has to
06:46 - do with the country that's inside of
06:48 - some of these modules so I'm gonna have
06:51 - a look through here and see if I can
06:52 - change anything so that we can order
06:54 - make sure that's ordering from Canada we
06:56 - don't have any issues like that but I'll
06:57 - be back in a second once I check through
06:59 - that okay so I've changed this here
07:01 - where it says country instead of ordered
07:02 - up pie to say ca for Canada I don't know
07:05 - if this is gonna work but we're gonna
07:06 - hop back in the command prompt and give
07:07 - it a shot if this doesn't work it's
07:10 - gonna be unfortunate because I won't
07:11 - really know how to fix this although I'm
07:13 - assuming this probably just has to do
07:14 - something with the fact that we have the
07:16 - wrong URL because this said the United
07:17 - States before it didn't say Canada so
07:19 - something to keep in mind if you're
07:20 - ordering from different countries or
07:22 - different continents or whatever you'll
07:23 - have to change the actual area code here
07:25 - and to be honest with you I don't know
07:26 - if Domino's is in like India per se like
07:29 - I don't know where this chain exists and
07:31 - not sure if it's just North American so
07:32 - I do apologize if you've kind of been
07:34 - following this and thought you could
07:35 - order from Domino's I don't know where
07:37 - the chain exists so let's give it a shot
07:38 - and it'll be right back okay so I'm in
07:41 - typed cache we've done this again let's
07:43 - see would you like to place yes
07:46 - error where are we gonna play
07:48 - successfully order placed for Rasika
07:51 - okay so that actually I think that
07:54 - actually worked so it said that this
07:57 - order was placed this is my last night
07:58 - as you guys have seen I might blurred
08:00 - out will depend on the video but it's
08:02 - fine I think you guys know my last name
08:03 - anyway so that's okay um so we didn't
08:05 - get an error we got some you know
08:07 - threaded sake error but it did say the
08:09 - order was placed it did not however say
08:13 - order place like this when I tried to
08:16 - place that my local dominos dot place
08:18 - order that's when we got the issue but I
08:21 - don't know where it prints order placed
08:23 - for whatever the name was so I'm gonna
08:25 - look around and see if I can find that
08:27 - and then we'll see if this actually
08:29 - happened I'm gonna call the store and
08:30 - see if this actually went through or not
08:32 - okay so I have a feeling that I need to
08:34 - change
08:35 - some more of these countries from all
08:37 - these files so I'm gonna continue to
08:39 - change these all to ca and then we're
08:41 - gonna have a look and see if this is
08:44 - gonna fix things because I have a
08:45 - feeling that we're just getting the
08:46 - issue with the with the country I'm
08:48 - pretty certain that's what it is because
08:50 - this should work like I've seen this
08:51 - used before so for you or else - yeah
08:53 - that's what it is okay so for the
08:55 - country here I need to change this to be
08:57 - country Canada so we're just gonna say
08:59 - country Canada which I think I have
09:00 - imported up here yes I do so that's what
09:02 - I'm gonna do that okay so that's exactly
09:04 - what it is so I just need to change that
09:06 - to be Canada in this file so this is
09:08 - URLs dot pie I've changed this to be
09:10 - Canada I've changed it inside of track
09:12 - dot pie as well to be ca I mean it
09:14 - doesn't matter if you use country Canada
09:15 - or CIA it's fine and now everything I
09:19 - think in here is Canada whereas before
09:20 - it was all defaulted at us so even this
09:23 - one okay begin custom order so this one
09:24 - needs to be country Canada as well so
09:26 - we'll put CA and I'm just gonna go
09:29 - through here and change these now
09:30 - there's obviously a much better would do
09:32 - this I can like that would probably as a
09:33 - way to set it from here but just for the
09:36 - sake of this right now like this is kind
09:38 - of the way I'm fixing it um but I mean
09:41 - yeah you guys can maybe tell me if you
09:43 - think there was a better way that I
09:44 - should have gone about doing that okay
09:45 - so we've done CA done countries past in
09:49 - here okay country Canada Canada order
09:52 - alright all of this stuff so I think
09:55 - we're good I'm gonna try it one more
09:56 - time and then again wheeled back hi can
09:59 - you check if an order went through for
10:00 - me that I placed online well I don't
10:04 - know the order number but can I can I
10:06 - give you a name okay let's do a so
10:15 - that's actually that went through the
10:16 - reason I'm asking because I'm I did this
10:18 - from like I wrote some code to order the
10:21 - pizza so I was yeah I wanted to see if
10:23 - it actually worked or not okay so it's
10:24 - coming it's on the way okay awesome um
10:31 - thank you very much alright okay so I'll
10:36 - see if I can include some of that in the
10:39 - video there but this actually works so I
10:41 - just called the store to confirm if my
10:43 - order has been placed or not and it has
10:45 - so I'm gonna I don't want to do this
10:47 - again because I don't want to order
10:48 - something else
10:49 - but I'm assuming now we won't get that
10:51 - issue afterwards because I fixed the
10:54 - country so I think what that was
10:56 - actually supposed to be giving me that
10:57 - other stuff where we got the error there
10:59 - was gonna tell me the tracking number
11:01 - for my order now obviously I don't have
11:03 - that tracking number so I'm not I'm not
11:05 - sure how much I'm gonna include in the
11:06 - video but I did call the store they said
11:08 - it's coming so we'll be back when this
11:09 - pizza arrives in a film will clip and
11:11 - show you guys that this actually did
11:12 - work alright so we're back in we have a
11:17 - Domino's Pizza let's refresh the clock
11:19 - its 12:40 4 p.m. so pretty much when he
11:22 - told me it was gonna come by and I
11:24 - believe that cost me twenty one dollars
11:26 - as opposed to what the total was on
11:28 - there like fourteen plus tax plus
11:29 - delivery plus all of that so that makes
11:31 - sense and to show you guys that I'm not
11:33 - lying
11:34 - actual pizza that was ordered using this
11:37 - program so I think that that is pretty
11:39 - freakin cool that that actually works
11:41 - that I can do that so yeah I mean that's
11:44 - pretty much it for this series the goal
11:46 - has been accomplished order a pizza with
11:48 - Python it has happened this pizza has
11:50 - mushrooms bacon what else does that on
11:53 - it pepperoni and some other ingredient
11:56 - on it and yeah so anyways that has been
11:58 - a series if you guys enjoyed leave a
12:00 - like subscribe to the channel and let me
12:02 - know if you're ordering any pizzas using
12:03 - this program
