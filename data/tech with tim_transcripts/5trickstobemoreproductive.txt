00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:10 - youtube video
00:11 - so in today's video i'm going to share
00:13 - with you five tips
00:14 - tricks to become more productive now
00:17 - these are not magic things that you can
00:18 - just go do and all of a sudden be the
00:20 - most productive human being
00:21 - these are just five kind of ideas
00:23 - philosophies that i've come up with over
00:25 - the past few years
00:26 - that have really worked well for me and
00:28 - allowed me to get a lot done
00:30 - in the time that i spend working this
00:32 - video is not at all
00:33 - going to be trying to tell you to work
00:34 - super hard go do you know 14 16 hours
00:37 - days that's not the point of this
00:38 - whatsoever
00:39 - it's how can you maximize what you get
00:41 - done in the time that you're working
00:43 - you guys know yourself you know your own
00:45 - lives you can pick how much time you
00:46 - want to work in a day
00:47 - and hopefully these kind of philosophies
00:49 - ideas tips whatever you want to call
00:51 - them
00:51 - will help you kind of realize what it is
00:53 - you need to do to actually get more done
00:55 - in a day now the reason i'm making this
00:57 - video is because a lot of you guys ask
00:58 - me all of the time
00:59 - tim i see you're a pretty young guy i
01:01 - know you are in school now you're doing
01:03 - youtube you're working for algo expert
01:04 - and other companies
01:05 - how do you get all this stuff done how
01:07 - do you find the motivation
01:08 - how do you actually just you know get
01:10 - all of this work done in one
01:12 - day it seems like a lot and well i'll
01:13 - try to answer that question in this
01:14 - video
01:15 - but the first thing i want to say here
01:17 - is that everyone is different right this
01:19 - stuff is not going to work for everybody
01:20 - this is just
01:21 - what worked for me i probably work a lot
01:24 - longer than most of you guys and there's
01:26 - pros and cons to doing that and so you
01:28 - can't really judge
01:29 - your productivity based on someone else
01:31 - you have to judge it on yourself are you
01:33 - more productive than you were yesterday
01:34 - that's really the only metric you should
01:36 - go
01:36 - be going based off of you can't look at
01:38 - some random person on the internet and
01:40 - be like oh i'm not as productive as them
01:41 - when in reality you have no idea what
01:43 - they do in a day
01:44 - what their schedule or time looks like
01:45 - and what they might be sacrificing to
01:47 - kind of get that productivity
01:48 - anyways sorry for the long intro let's
01:50 - get into the video after a quick word

02:38 - in the description and using the code
02:40 - tech with tim for a discount on
02:41 - the platform alright so let's go ahead
02:43 - and dive in the first
02:45 - tip slash trick i have for you is to
02:47 - have a goal
02:48 - and actually to have multiple goals now
02:51 - this is extremely important and one of
02:53 - the reasons for this
02:54 - is it's very hard to work hard and be
02:57 - productive
02:57 - if you don't know why you're doing that
03:00 - right
03:01 - that's like pretty much anything if
03:02 - someone tells you to do something and it
03:04 - doesn't make sense to you
03:05 - you're much less likely to do it i
03:07 - remember as a kid
03:08 - all the time i would just not do what
03:10 - teachers told me because it wouldn't
03:11 - make sense what they were asking me to
03:13 - do and until someone explained to me
03:15 - why it was i needed to get something
03:16 - done or why i needed to do this
03:18 - then i would actually go ahead and do it
03:20 - now the same thing happens here in just
03:21 - general life when it comes to
03:23 - productivity let's say you're in a
03:25 - computer science major trying to pick
03:26 - something that's probably relatable for
03:27 - some of you
03:28 - and you guys are just lazy unproductive
03:31 - you're like oh i don't like this i don't
03:32 - want to do this
03:33 - one of the main reasons you're probably
03:35 - like that is because you don't actually
03:37 - know why it is you're doing this
03:38 - computer science major
03:40 - you haven't created those goals in your
03:42 - head and when i'm talking about goals
03:44 - i'm saying something like where do you
03:45 - want to be in 30 years
03:47 - where do you want to be in 25 years
03:49 - what's the point of getting a degree
03:50 - what's the point of this education
03:52 - do you know that do you have that reason
03:54 - kind of stored up in your brain are you
03:56 - thinking about that
03:57 - as you go and work towards this goal for
03:59 - a lot of people the answer is no and so
04:01 - you have to have goals to be able to
04:03 - become
04:04 - productive again you can't work on
04:06 - something very hard and be productive
04:08 - you don't know why it is that you're
04:09 - doing that
04:10 - so you either have to come up with the
04:11 - reasons even if they don't make you know
04:14 - the total complete sense but you have to
04:16 - convince yourself that what you're doing
04:18 - is worth it and once you do that then
04:20 - your brain kind of says okay it is worth
04:22 - it for me to stay up an extra hour and
04:24 - work on this
04:25 - it is a good use of my time to you know
04:26 - grind this and study this and get an a
04:28 - and well you have to have goals now i'm
04:30 - just picking a very kind of naive
04:32 - example which is school
04:33 - but let's put this to my youtube channel
04:34 - here the only reason why i've been able
04:36 - to grow this youtube channel is because
04:38 - the goal of mine
04:39 - has been okay i want to achieve
04:40 - financial freedom i want to be the best
04:42 - tech
04:43 - educator on the internet i have these
04:45 - very large goals and every day i analyze
04:47 - what i'm doing and i say am i working
04:49 - towards these goals
04:50 - and you know when i'm super tired and
04:52 - exhausted i wake up in the morning ready
04:53 - to film a video i say why am i filming
04:55 - this video
04:56 - it's because it's helping me achieve
04:58 - this goal if i didn't have these goals
05:00 - you're kind of just meaninglessly doing
05:02 - activities and it's very hard to justify
05:04 - especially when you're tired or
05:05 - demotivated
05:06 - why you should go and continue to do
05:08 - that and of course that's going to lead
05:09 - to a lack of productivity
05:11 - so it's hard to really articulate this
05:13 - but you can even think of this in a very
05:14 - large picture when it comes to
05:15 - organizations
05:17 - most organizations fail because they
05:18 - don't have a clear vision
05:20 - or kind of road map from the top of the
05:22 - organization have you ever been at a
05:24 - company where you're doing something but
05:25 - you don't know
05:26 - why you're doing it it's not leading
05:27 - towards the vision or the mission of the
05:29 - company
05:30 - those companies are usually not great
05:31 - places to work out yeah maybe you'll go
05:33 - in and kind of do your eight hours just
05:35 - to get paid
05:35 - but you're not motivated you're not
05:37 - excited you don't know why it is you're
05:38 - doing a task
05:39 - and you guys could probably relate to
05:41 - this in almost every area of life when
05:42 - someone asks you to do something but
05:44 - doesn't explain to you why
05:45 - and it doesn't make sense to you you're
05:47 - a lot less likely to want to go and do
05:49 - that thing
05:49 - because you don't know why it is that
05:51 - you're doing that and same thing when it
05:52 - comes to getting a degree
05:53 - same thing when it comes to you know
05:54 - staying up an extra hour at night to
05:56 - read
05:56 - whatever it is you have to have a goal
05:58 - and usually a large goal in mind
06:00 - so you can justify those activities so i
06:03 - could talk about this in an entire video
06:05 - just goal setting maybe i'll do that let
06:06 - me know if you guys want to see that i
06:07 - think that might be an interesting video
06:09 - but let's move on to the next point now
06:11 - hopefully you guys got the idea from
06:12 - that
06:12 - all right so the second point i have for
06:14 - you is much more of a mindset thing
06:16 - but this is to help your future self now
06:19 - you're going to notice that all these
06:20 - points and tips whatever are
06:21 - very related to each other and when i
06:23 - say help your future self
06:25 - what i'm talking about is to think of
06:27 - what you're doing as something that
06:28 - you're doing to help yourself
06:30 - in the future now to give you a really
06:32 - simple example let's say you get an
06:34 - assignment okay
06:34 - and this week maybe you're not super
06:36 - busy you have this maybe programming
06:38 - assignment let's say it's going to take
06:39 - you four or five hours to finish
06:41 - you could leave it till the very last
06:42 - minute you could do it the next day
06:44 - whatever but if you adopt the mindset of
06:47 - hey in the future i might not want to do
06:49 - this i might be tired i might want to go
06:51 - hang out with my friends
06:53 - right now i have a few hours why don't i
06:55 - just knock it out so that in the future
06:56 - i'm going to say oh
06:57 - thank god tim already did that
06:58 - assignment now i'm speaking in the third
07:00 - person
07:01 - but you know what i mean and this is a
07:02 - very rewarding thing because what ends
07:04 - up happening when you adopt this mayans
07:06 - and you say you know what i'm going to
07:07 - do this now so i don't have to do in the
07:09 - future
07:09 - so when i'm tired i can just sleep in
07:11 - that extra hour in the morning so i can
07:13 - go hang out with my friends
07:14 - life becomes just a lot more enjoyable
07:16 - you don't have any stress you don't have
07:17 - any deadlines you need to complete
07:19 - because you've helped yourself in the
07:21 - future you've said all right i know i
07:23 - have time now i'm in a state where i can
07:24 - finish this now
07:25 - let's get it done and then in the future
07:27 - i'm going to thank myself when i want to
07:28 - go to that party or i want to go
07:30 - and play video games or whatever because
07:32 - i don't have this kind of looming
07:33 - deadline
07:34 - and the stuff that i need to finish and
07:36 - this relieves stress a lot especially if
07:38 - you apply this to kind of a school
07:39 - scenario
07:40 - if you do all of your assignments
07:42 - immediately when you get them you just
07:43 - get stuff
07:44 - done when you're capable of getting it
07:45 - done and you don't waste time
07:47 - it's just a much better way to kind of
07:50 - go through school and go through life
07:51 - because you're not constantly stressed
07:53 - am i going to finish this am i going to
07:54 - have enough time am i going to have to
07:56 - do a 14 hour night you don't have to
07:57 - deal with that anymore and that's a huge
07:59 - mental load kind of relieved and that's
08:01 - the way that i really navigated school
08:03 - and was able to get all of the stuff
08:05 - that i did done was because i did it
08:07 - very early and i was never like
08:09 - grinding last minute to finish something
08:11 - because i just did it earlier in the
08:12 - week and i never had a deadline that i
08:14 - felt like i needed to hit
08:15 - so this is a very specific example with
08:17 - school but apply this to every single
08:19 - scenario even something like a degree
08:21 - okay it might suck for four years to go
08:23 - through school and you might be
08:24 - miserable and you might be broke but
08:26 - in four years are you going to thank
08:27 - yourself for getting this degree done
08:29 - maybe right you have to answer that
08:30 - question and so that's the way i always
08:32 - think about things
08:33 - i'm putting in a sacrifice now to help
08:34 - myself in the future
08:36 - and in the future i'm going to thank
08:38 - myself for putting in those long hours
08:39 - or working hard or being productive
08:41 - or whatever it may be so really just a
08:43 - mindset thing obviously much easier said
08:45 - than done
08:45 - but that's the way that i look at things
08:47 - and that's one of the ways i'm able to
08:49 - justify
08:50 - getting a lot done kind of in the
08:51 - present moment all right so the next
08:53 - point i have for you is another
08:55 - very important one if you get only one
08:57 - point from this list this is the one
08:58 - that i would recommend
08:59 - really kind of focusing on and this is
09:01 - to measure your productivity with
09:03 - outcome not time now this is so
09:07 - extremely important because time does
09:10 - not
09:10 - state how productive you were in a day
09:12 - what i mean by this is a lot of people
09:14 - think
09:14 - hey i went to class for four hours today
09:16 - or hey i went to my
09:17 - job for eight hours or i worked on this
09:19 - project for six hours
09:21 - and they measure their productivity in
09:22 - terms of hours spent
09:24 - that is not a good way to measure
09:26 - productivity because
09:27 - you can spend and waste hours in pretty
09:29 - much any way right
09:31 - what you should really be doing is
09:32 - looking at okay i spent this much time
09:34 - doing this today
09:35 - what was the outcome of that time what
09:37 - did i actually get done
09:39 - for example i can say i spent five hours
09:41 - working on this youtube video but if i
09:43 - only got done
09:44 - one youtube video in five hours was that
09:47 - productive right that was the outcome of
09:48 - my five hours spent
09:50 - if i had maybe two hours but i finished
09:52 - two videos when was i more productive
09:54 - when i finished two videos right
09:55 - so that's what you need to look at it's
09:56 - not how much time did you spend working
09:58 - in a day it's what did you get done in a
10:00 - day and are you happy with that outcome
10:02 - that's the way you have to look at
10:04 - things because if you look at it in
10:05 - terms of time
10:06 - inevitably you're not going to be the
10:08 - most productive in that time you're
10:09 - going to try to spend
10:10 - extra time doing things like going to uh
10:13 - you know maybe an extra class or like
10:15 - watching videos online or whatever that
10:17 - aren't actually a good use of your time
10:19 - and that are not leading you to be
10:21 - productive
10:21 - now the best real example of this i'd
10:23 - like to give is going to class in school
10:25 - now i'm not here to try to encourage
10:26 - anyone to just skip
10:27 - classes but for me what worked really
10:30 - well in school was going to about
10:32 - 20 of my classes that was actually the
10:34 - amount of class that i went to i
10:36 - probably skipped almost
10:37 - all of second year almost all of third
10:39 - year and only went to like absolutely
10:41 - mandatory classes
10:42 - and the reason for that was not because
10:43 - i just hated the professors and was just
10:45 - a lazy student
10:46 - it was because i knew that my time was
10:48 - better spent and i was more productive
10:51 - on my own on my computer reading the
10:53 - notes reading the textbook and self
10:55 - studying that's the way i learned that's
10:56 - what works best for me and so if i
10:58 - measured my time
10:59 - in terms of how much time i spent on
11:01 - school in a day i wouldn't have realized
11:03 - that because i would have thought
11:04 - spending four hours in lectures was me
11:07 - being productive
11:08 - when in reality i could achieve the same
11:10 - learning outcome
11:11 - in like an hour and a half on my own and
11:14 - so i would say i'm much more productive
11:16 - by
11:16 - staying home right or not going to class
11:18 - reading it myself
11:19 - than i am on going to class even though
11:22 - it's kind of this false sense of oh i
11:23 - spent three or four hours
11:25 - must have meant i had a good productive
11:26 - day right same thing when you go to the
11:28 - gym you can go to the gym for an hour
11:30 - and a half and do the same number of
11:31 - exercises that i do in half an hour
11:33 - who was really more productive if you
11:35 - say well i went to the gym for an hour
11:36 - and a half that means i'm productive
11:38 - that's the wrong way to look at it you
11:39 - have to say how much did i get done
11:41 - in that time that i was there so time is
11:44 - not
11:44 - not important you do have to measure
11:46 - time spent but it's really more focused
11:48 - on the outcome
11:49 - and that's why you see you know all
11:50 - kinds of entrepreneurs and random people
11:52 - saying you know
11:52 - i only work eight hours a week only work
11:54 - seven hours a week well if they can get
11:56 - done in eight hours what you get done in
11:58 - 40 who is being more productive right
12:00 - that's what you really have to think
12:01 - about
12:02 - so anyways that's that point right there
12:03 - now let's move on to the next one
12:05 - all right so point number four
12:06 - something's a little bit more mainstream
12:08 - and obvious but this is to
12:09 - plan far in advance when i say far in
12:12 - advance i'm not talking about years i'm
12:13 - talking about months right
12:15 - understand what weeks in the month or
12:18 - what days of the month
12:19 - you're going to have that are much
12:21 - busier than others because this
12:23 - allows you to balance your time now for
12:25 - me what allows me to be productive
12:27 - is working relatively the same amount of
12:29 - time every single day
12:31 - i do not want to work 12 hours in one
12:33 - day and zero in the next i would much
12:35 - rather work six in each day
12:37 - and have time each day for fun enjoyment
12:39 - whatever right i would much rather do
12:41 - that maybe that's just me
12:42 - but personally i find that a much better
12:44 - way to be productive it
12:45 - i find you're much more productive
12:47 - working you know five six hours a day
12:49 - than trying to do 12
12:50 - even though yes you could probably do
12:52 - 12. and so if you plan
12:53 - far in advance you're able to actually
12:55 - kind of manage your time and what you
12:57 - get done and your productivity
12:59 - based on when you know stuff is going to
13:01 - be really busy and when you're not going
13:02 - to have as much time
13:03 - for example next week i'm going away i'm
13:05 - doing you know a week-long vacation i'm
13:07 - going fishing fun fact
13:08 - so what i've had to do this week is i've
13:10 - had to work a little bit harder but the
13:12 - thing is if i only knew about that this
13:14 - week
13:14 - i would have to grind really really hard
13:16 - to prepare a bunch of videos from when
13:18 - i'm gone
13:18 - but i've known that i'm going to be
13:20 - going away for three months and so
13:22 - over the past three months i've been
13:23 - slowly trying to do you know a little
13:25 - bit extra
13:26 - just to make sure that i didn't have a
13:27 - super heavy week the week before i went
13:30 - away
13:30 - and i could kind of balance my time and
13:32 - i didn't have to do a huge
13:34 - 12-hour grind i didn't have to be
13:35 - miserable and that allowed me to stay
13:37 - productive throughout this entire time
13:39 - so that's like a small example but when
13:41 - it comes to school one thing i always do
13:43 - is at the beginning of the semester i
13:44 - spend you know an hour or two looking
13:46 - through all the syllabuses all the
13:47 - course content
13:48 - and i go and i write every single
13:50 - deadline every single assignment in my
13:52 - calendar
13:53 - so i know when i look at this high level
13:55 - overview oh next week's going to be
13:56 - super busy
13:57 - i better do a little bit of extra work
13:58 - right now to make sure i'm not going to
14:00 - have to grind that week
14:01 - and that just helps me become more
14:03 - productive allows me to not be miserable
14:05 - and you know tapping out of exhaustion
14:07 - at the 14 hour mark studying for a
14:09 - midterm
14:09 - and that's just really a great way to
14:11 - kind of you know balance your time and
14:13 - make sure you're not overworking
14:14 - yourself while staying productive
14:16 - so there's not much more that i can
14:17 - really go through here the whole point
14:19 - at least for me and planning
14:21 - far in advance is that you're prepared
14:23 - for what's coming up and you can do
14:25 - extra work now to make sure you're not
14:26 - going to have a huge workload in the
14:28 - future
14:28 - that you're not going to be able to
14:29 - sustain anyways let's move on to the
14:31 - next point
14:32 - all right so the last point i have for
14:34 - you this one is very important and this
14:36 - is to
14:36 - make sure you are allocating time for
14:39 - fun
14:39 - and protecting that time so in your
14:42 - calendar
14:43 - in your daily schedule in whatever way
14:45 - you want to do it i can't tell you how
14:46 - to do this
14:47 - you need to make sure that you have a
14:49 - set time either every day
14:51 - every week every month whatever it may
14:52 - be to do things that you enjoy
14:54 - to make you happy to increase your
14:56 - mental health and to make sure you're
14:58 - not burning yourself out right
15:00 - one of the big problems with
15:01 - productivity and even videos like this
15:03 - is that it kind of tells people that you
15:05 - have to be miserable
15:06 - and you have to go and grind and work
15:08 - super hard and know you don't have time
15:10 - for this and you can't go and hang out
15:12 - with your friends
15:12 - that's absolutely false through the
15:14 - entire time that i've been doing all of
15:16 - this stuff
15:17 - i've made sure that i can go and spend a
15:19 - weekend hanging out with my friends or i
15:20 - can take a week off at any point in time
15:22 - or i can spend three or four hours at
15:24 - night playing video games because those
15:26 - are things that i enjoy doing and i'm
15:27 - not willing to give those
15:29 - up just to call myself more productive
15:31 - there's actually a ton of
15:32 - research and evidence and books and
15:35 - stuff related to
15:36 - how happiness and fun actually affect
15:38 - the success of someone in their career
15:41 - and you can probably guess what i'm
15:42 - going to say but the happier people are
15:44 - often more
15:45 - successful and so if you're thinking
15:46 - about this in a sheer productivity lens
15:48 - then you have to say okay it actually
15:50 - might be very productive for me to spend
15:52 - two hours tonight just doing nothing
15:55 - just hanging out relaxing
15:56 - you know recharging for the next day and
15:58 - that's the way that i think about it
16:00 - and i have a lot of kind of routines i
16:02 - do daily to make sure i'm getting my fun
16:04 - in for example i don't book any meetings
16:06 - usually unless i really have to
16:08 - before 10 am because in the mornings
16:10 - what i like to do is get up
16:11 - have a coffee watch some youtube videos
16:13 - maybe play some video games i've been
16:15 - playing chess recently that's something
16:16 - i really like doing and i'm not willing
16:18 - to give that up
16:19 - and if i don't do that i find myself
16:22 - craving that activity and that really
16:24 - does actually affect my productivity
16:26 - so even though you might think oh i'm
16:27 - spending an hour two hours having fun
16:29 - and enjoying myself
16:30 - that may actually be leading you to have
16:32 - more productivity
16:34 - and success in whatever you're doing so
16:35 - you have to really have the balance
16:37 - i can't tell you how to do this i just
16:38 - wanted to make sure i included this here
16:40 - because
16:41 - everything else i've said is kind of
16:42 - very you know robust go do this go be
16:44 - productive go work help yourself
16:46 - very disciplined right whereas this is
16:48 - kind of the opposite of that and it's
16:50 - saying you know what sometimes you can
16:51 - step back and sometimes it's fine to
16:52 - sleep the entire day
16:54 - maybe that is actually going to make you
16:55 - more productive and so for myself if i
16:57 - find myself burning out or i find myself
16:59 - not enjoying myself not being happy
17:01 - then what i'll often do is okay you know
17:03 - maybe it's actually worth my time to
17:04 - take a day off here and to just relax
17:06 - maybe i'm going to go hang out with my
17:07 - friends maybe i'm going to go out
17:09 - fishing
17:09 - whatever do something that i enjoy so
17:11 - that the next day i'm kind of in a
17:13 - better mindset and ready to actually
17:14 - work
17:15 - and get stuff done all right so with
17:17 - that said i think i'm going to end the
17:18 - video here
