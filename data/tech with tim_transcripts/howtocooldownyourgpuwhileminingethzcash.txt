00:01 - [Music]
00:05 - hey guys I'm just doing a quick intro
00:07 - for this video uh I realized after
00:09 - watching this video I talked a lot and
00:11 - if you guys are just looking for the
00:12 - quick easy solution on how to cool down
00:14 - your GPU you're going to want to skip uh
00:17 - to the time that I have up here I think
00:19 - it's about 5 minutes in uh if you want
00:21 - to learn about why your graphics card
00:22 - runs so hot why uh these temperatures
00:25 - are important and why it needs to stay
00:27 - cool then go ahead and watch the whole
00:28 - video but if you just want the fix and
00:30 - that's all you're here for go ahead and
00:32 - Skip to this part right here and it only
00:34 - takes about a minute or two to explain
00:36 - that so that'll be a quick video for you
00:38 - guys hey guys and welcome back to
00:40 - another YouTube video so in today's
00:42 - video I'm going to be going over a
00:43 - problem a lot of people have and
00:45 - especially a lot of people that are
00:46 - mining ethereum or uh just GPU mining in
00:49 - general encounter and that's the fact
00:51 - that your graphics card runs super
00:54 - freaking hot now when I say that I mean
00:57 - that my card when mining ethereum is
00:59 - actually hot enough to cook an egg now I
01:01 - haven't tested that theory uh but that
01:03 - might be coming up in a future video
01:05 - we'll see because it runs between 80 and
01:07 - 90 degre CI uh if I put my hand on the
01:10 - outside of the card I can't hold it
01:12 - there for very long without starting to
01:14 - uh feel like I'm getting burned now that
01:17 - is way too hot for my liking and
01:19 - probably way too hot for a lot of your
01:21 - likings uh especially if you're watching
01:23 - this video trying to cool down your GPU
01:25 - so I'm going to be going over a way that
01:26 - we can fix that now right now I just
01:29 - have MSI After Burner open this is a
01:30 - useful program if you don't already have
01:32 - this program uh go ahead and download it
01:34 - I'm going to leave a link in the
01:35 - description down below it's free and
01:37 - it's actually made by MSI so it's
01:39 - perfectly safe to use and um don't worry
01:42 - about it all we're going to be doing
01:43 - here is simply changing the fan curve on
01:46 - our GPU now you can see here I have a
01:49 - temperature I'd say somewhat idle
01:51 - because I am recording a video so I am
01:53 - using the GPU a little bit uh 57° C now
01:56 - this already is very hot I know um for
01:59 - an item
02:01 - graphics card now you guys probably have
02:03 - yours running anywhere between 30 and
02:05 - 60° C if it's much higher than that on
02:07 - idle when you're not doing anything then
02:10 - you probably have an issue with your
02:11 - card or you have pretty bad air flow in
02:13 - your case now you can also see I have
02:16 - this other hardware monitor up here just
02:17 - to show you that it is running again 58°
02:20 - you can see over here the for
02:21 - temperatures of my card uh so that
02:23 - there's no question that we're getting
02:24 - the right temperature from our software
02:26 - here so if it's coming both the same
02:28 - here then it's probably fairly accurate
02:31 - so I'm going to go ahead and close this
02:32 - one that one is just to prove to you
02:34 - guys um and now I'm going to start
02:36 - mining ethereum just to illustrate to
02:38 - you the problem that I at least was
02:39 - having and the heat that we would that I
02:41 - would be seeing on my graphics card so
02:43 - I'm going to go ahead and open up my
02:44 - minor just by double clicking the little
02:46 - bat file here if you guys don't know how
02:48 - to mine ethereum uh go check out my
02:50 - video it I'll leave a card in the top
02:53 - right hand corner up here on how to mine
02:55 - ethereum for beginners it's pretty
02:57 - useful I go over all the steps uh make
02:59 - sure you check that out if you haven't
03:01 - or if you don't already know how to mine
03:02 - ethereum and we'll just give it a second
03:04 - to start mining while we are monitoring
03:06 - the temperature on MSI now I just notied
03:09 - as I look back over here we've already
03:11 - jumped from about 57 to 77 and we
03:14 - haven't even got through the initial
03:15 - setup stages of our Miner yet and we've
03:18 - probably only been mining for about 20
03:19 - to 30 seconds now we're going to see
03:21 - this continue to Rise um not sure
03:23 - exactly how high it'll go right now but
03:25 - sometimes I see this go up to about 90°
03:27 - C uh my room's fairly cold right now so
03:30 - the ambient temperature is probably
03:31 - going to affect a little bit and yeah we
03:34 - can see we're already at 82° C and if I
03:37 - were to continue to mine on this for a
03:40 - few hours we'd probably be sitting
03:41 - anywhere between 88 maybe even 90°
03:45 - Celsius which is too hot for my liking
03:48 - now you guys probably can't hear it but
03:49 - the fan is also starting to rev up on my
03:52 - GPU you can see we've gone from 21% to
03:55 - 33% if we're just looking at the minor
03:57 - and if we're looking at MSI uh it says
03:59 - we're at 40 7% fan speed right now so
04:02 - I'm going to go ahead and close my minor
04:04 - uh and now I'm going to show you how we
04:06 - can fix this issue and then see if it
04:09 - actually did work for our minor now I am
04:11 - going to say this is not going to give
04:12 - you incredible results you're not going
04:14 - to go from your 90° C to 60° CI that's
04:19 - just very hard to do uh and there's a
04:21 - lot more that need to be changed than
04:22 - just the fan speed but pretty much when
04:25 - you have a graphics card it is set to
04:27 - Target a certain temperature meaning it
04:29 - wants to run at that temperature my card
04:32 - is set to Target 80° C so it really
04:34 - doesn't start kicking the fan up until
04:36 - it gets past 80° C and that's something
04:39 - I don't want I don't even want my card
04:40 - to hit 80° C so the way that I can make
04:43 - it uh and cool it down is just by using
04:46 - a simple thing that comes in MSI After
04:48 - Burner now you can see we have this
04:50 - little Auto button here and if you
04:52 - unclick this button so it's no longer
04:54 - red now we're actually able to drag this
04:57 - fan speed here so this percentage
05:00 - now this doesn't tell us in RPMs uh but
05:02 - that's fine percentage will work you can
05:03 - see that my card if I put it back on
05:05 - auto right now at 55° C we're running
05:09 - 39% now typically it's a lot lower than
05:11 - this uh just cuz we were just really hot
05:13 - so it's cooling it down uh but you'll
05:15 - see it go all the way down to 21% now a
05:18 - quick really fast way uh to cool down
05:21 - your card and if you don't mind having a
05:23 - really loud temperature is you can just
05:25 - uncheck this Auto button and slide your
05:28 - bar up to what percentage you always
05:30 - want it to run at so I'll go ahead and
05:32 - check that there and you can probably
05:34 - now hear my computer uh revving the fan
05:37 - if you can't I'll just let you know just
05:39 - trust me it's very loud um the fan on my
05:43 - graphics card is ridiculously loud and
05:45 - that's why I don't do this specific one
05:47 - because while I'm not mining ethereum I
05:50 - don't want my card to be running so uh
05:53 - so loud at least I'd rather have the
05:55 - silence and a little bit more heat and
05:56 - you can see we've dropped down a little
05:57 - bit in temperature we're going to
05:58 - continue to drop
06:00 - as if I'm running my fan at this high
06:02 - speed then more heat is going to be
06:04 - taken off my card you can see we're
06:06 - going down to 47 so that already
06:08 - illustrates that this is a quick fix to
06:10 - cool down your card now this is great if
06:13 - you guys are just going to do this and
06:15 - put your fans at 65% or whatever you
06:18 - want to put them at and then just leave
06:20 - your computer down in your basement and
06:22 - it doesn't bother you it's not sitting
06:23 - on your desk you're not going to hear it
06:25 - but if you're someone like me who still
06:27 - uses your computer while you're mining
06:29 - then you're probably not going to want
06:30 - to do this and the way that I like to
06:33 - fix this is by doing something different
06:35 - so I'm going to uncheck this here and
06:37 - click the check mark so that my fan
06:38 - speed slows down a bit and I'm actually
06:40 - going to go to this settings button on
06:42 - MSI now here I'm going to go to
06:45 - fan and I'm going to go to this enable
06:49 - userdefined automatic fan control we're
06:51 - just going to check mark that box now
06:54 - this brings up a little fan curve for us
06:56 - here now you don't really have to
06:58 - understand exactly how this works but
06:59 - pretty much this is just a little graph
07:01 - or a little chart or whatever we have
07:03 - fan speed on the y- AIS and temperature
07:05 - on the x-axis and you can see these dots
07:08 - represent that at 90° C our fan will be
07:11 - running at
07:13 - 100% so I'm going to go ahead I'm going
07:15 - to start editing some of these fan
07:17 - curves uh so that my card is going to be
07:19 - running at a certain fan percentage
07:21 - based on the temperature now you can see
07:23 - at 30° we're going to be running at 40%
07:26 - I'm going to bump that up just a little
07:28 - bit so maybe about 4 45% I'm just going
07:31 - to really bring all all these uh up
07:34 - slightly so I'm going to bring this one
07:35 - up uh from 50° to 60% going to move this
07:39 - one over a bit going to move this one up
07:41 - and just play with this graph uh so that
07:43 - it's something at your liking and you
07:44 - can see now we have at 70° C we're going
07:47 - to be running at
07:49 - 90% now I wouldn't recommend running
07:52 - your fans at 100% as that's going to
07:54 - wear them out I usually don't like to go
07:56 - any more than 80% on my fan
08:00 - especially on my GPU because it gets
08:02 - really loud when I go that high and
08:04 - whenever you're done this little fan
08:06 - curve here you're done this chart just
08:08 - go ahead and click
08:09 - okay and then you can probably hear now
08:12 - that my fan is starting to rev up a lot
08:14 - if you want to disable and enable this
08:16 - all you have to do is click this little
08:18 - setting button on
08:19 - MSI and it'll change the fan speed so
08:22 - you can see we already we just went back
08:23 - down to 19 you click it again and then
08:25 - we're up so what I do with this is
08:28 - whenever I'm about to mining ethereum
08:30 - I'll click on this little fan curve here
08:32 - and then I'll start running my Miner and
08:35 - you guys can see the temperature is
08:36 - dropping and was dropping before when I
08:38 - had it running at 65% and that's pretty
08:41 - much all you need to do to cool down
08:42 - your GPU while you are mining now if you
08:46 - guys enjoyed the video please leave a
08:48 - like And subscribe to the channel if you
08:50 - have any questions or any comments
