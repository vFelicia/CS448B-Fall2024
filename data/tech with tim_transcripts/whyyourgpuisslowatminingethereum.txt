00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:02 - youtube video so in today's video i'm
00:04 - going to be going over something that
00:06 - i've seen a lot of comments about and
00:08 - something that i was wondering about
00:09 - when i was mining ethereum so as we all
00:12 - know the price of ethereum has been
00:14 - skyrocketing lately so maybe not in the
00:16 - past month or so we've seen a decline
00:18 - but if we look back a year ago we can
00:20 - see the price has grown tremendously and
00:22 - that means that the amount of users and
00:24 - the amount of people that are mining
00:26 - ethereum has also gone up
00:28 - so pretty much uh this is my little
00:30 - mining window here i'm gonna zoom it in
00:32 - so that everyone can see a little bit
00:33 - better
00:34 - and you'll notice that i'm using an amd
00:37 - rx 480 as eight gigabytes of video ram
00:40 - it's a good graphics card and it's only
00:42 - mining at 16.1 mega hash per second now
00:46 - it is to be noted this is not
00:47 - overclocked this does not have a bios
00:49 - flash and
00:51 - i am recording a video right now so it
00:53 - is slightly slower than usual but not by
00:55 - much so i usually can expect to get
00:57 - between 17 and 18 mega hash per second
01:00 - which is a lot slower than what i used
01:02 - to mine at
01:03 - say for example if we take if we uh go
01:05 - back in time to maybe about the summer
01:08 - so like july
01:09 - uh
01:10 - september around then i was mining at 22
01:14 - 23 mega hash per second stock meaning
01:16 - without overclocking my card that's how
01:18 - much i could get if i overclocked i
01:20 - could maybe even push to 25 mega hashes
01:22 - per second
01:23 - so we can see that that is a huge
01:25 - difference in uh in speed so now the
01:27 - real question is well why does it look
01:30 - like this why are we mining so much
01:32 - slower
01:33 - now there's a few reasons for this but
01:34 - the main one that i want to bring up is
01:36 - this right here
01:37 - so this is just an ethereum mining
01:40 - difficulty chart as we can see here
01:43 - and it shows us the difficulty of the
01:45 - network starting from october and to now
01:48 - and we can see that this chart is
01:50 - growing and going upwards now if you
01:53 - don't know when you mine ethereum uh
01:55 - there's a certain difficulty level now
01:58 - after a certain amount of my uh blocks
02:00 - have been mined that difficulty level
02:02 - increases so just like we can no longer
02:04 - mine bitcoin off of our computers if we
02:07 - want to actually make somewhat of a
02:08 - profit that's similar to what's
02:10 - happening to ethereum
02:12 - not on the same level but it is similar
02:15 - so if we remember uh bitcoin people used
02:17 - to build a mine on their computers just
02:19 - like we might ethereum but now you need
02:21 - asic mining hardware to actually be able
02:22 - to make any real money mining bitcoin
02:25 - because it is so difficult to mine it
02:28 - so pretty much as the network gets more
02:30 - advanced the difficulty continues to go
02:31 - up and we can see that we are
02:33 - continually growing so obviously as the
02:36 - uh
02:37 - difficulty grows and our graphics cards
02:40 - don't get any more advanced we're gonna
02:42 - be mining slower and that's just the
02:44 - story of it so i'm gonna if we look up
02:47 - here we can see that there's something
02:48 - that says the dag eposh okay now this
02:52 - happens every time you load up your
02:53 - miner it shows you this dag and this dag
02:56 - number now this number represents the
02:58 - difficulty of the network so when i
03:01 - started mining my dag was at about 130
03:05 - so that was pretty low and that's when i
03:07 - was getting those high mega hashes so 23
03:09 - to 25 mega hashes and now you can see
03:11 - we're at 170 so as this number increases
03:14 - your mining performance decreases now
03:16 - this is going to be different depending
03:18 - on what card you have and there are
03:20 - still some cards that are mining at the
03:21 - same mega hashes they were mining at uh
03:23 - maybe a few months ago but
03:26 - depending on the graphics card you have
03:27 - your
03:29 - your hashing speed is going to decrease
03:31 - over time and that's just something that
03:32 - you have to understand
03:34 - so for example if you had bought a card
03:36 - a few months ago
03:38 - and you're expecting it to keep the same
03:40 - hashing power well that's not going to
03:42 - happen and the only way that you can
03:44 - really get back that hashing power is by
03:46 - doing something like modding your bios
03:48 - or by trying to overclock your card and
03:50 - even with a standard overclock it's
03:51 - going to be difficult to get those uh
03:54 - those same numbers that you had in the
03:56 - past so i hope this answered your
03:58 - question on why
03:59 - the
04:00 - your mega hash is or your mining speed
04:02 - is going down
04:04 - uh pretty much as the network gets more
04:06 - advanced so does the difficulty and that
04:09 - means that your card is not going to be
04:10 - mining as fast as it was before so if
04:12 - you guys have any other questions or any
