00:00 - hey guys welcome back to another video
00:02 - this is the eighteenth video in my
00:04 - Python programming series and today
00:07 - we're going to be talking about
00:07 - something called a try and accept block
00:10 - of code so just like we talked about the
00:12 - if-else and Elif block of code and like
00:16 - we talked about the for loop which is a
00:18 - block of code and like functions which
00:19 - are blocks of code we're gonna be
00:21 - talking about to try and accept so in
00:24 - Python we use try and accept as our
00:26 - keywords and other languages you may
00:28 - have heard of try and catch statements
00:30 - this is the same thing except in Python
00:32 - instead of catch we use accept okay so
00:35 - let's talk about what a try and accept
00:37 - statement is sometimes in Python you
00:40 - want to do an operation or you want to
00:42 - try something but you don't know if it's
00:44 - really going to work or not there's some
00:46 - different variables they may come in
00:47 - sometimes it may work sometimes it may
00:50 - not work usually this depends on user
00:52 - input or what the user is doing in the
00:55 - program
00:56 - so a good example of this is maybe if
00:58 - we're validating a form so we'll do an
01:00 - example you would say text is equal to
01:03 - input like this and then we'll say
01:07 - username okay now in typical user names
01:12 - you're only allowed certain characters
01:13 - maybe you can't do a comma you couldn't
01:16 - do a star certain things like that right
01:18 - maybe we only want it to be text so we
01:21 - only want it to be numbers we just want
01:23 - to validate this we could use a huge if
01:25 - statement to do this but instead there's
01:29 - something called a try and except that
01:31 - we can use so in this case I want my
01:33 - username to only be numbers so I don't
01:36 - want it to be string at all I want it to
01:38 - only be numbers so what I'm going to do
01:41 - is I'm going to make a new variable here
01:43 - and I'm going to call it number and all
01:46 - I'm going to do is I'm going to try to
01:47 - int the text like this okay so if you
01:51 - remember what the int does is that
01:53 - simply converts our string into an
01:55 - integer and then I'm going to print that
01:57 - to the screen so I'm going to print
01:58 - number to the screen now what happens
02:02 - right here is if I try to type in a word
02:04 - like this you see we get an error it
02:07 - says there's an invalid literal for inks
02:09 - with base 10 now you don't have to
02:11 - understand what this error is pretty
02:13 - much all this means
02:13 - that we can't convert too low into a
02:15 - number because there is really no number
02:18 - there how how does it know what number
02:20 - to make that into right so in this case
02:22 - we would use a try and except look
02:25 - because if the user types in something
02:28 - that's invalid well we want them to type
02:31 - in something else we don't want the
02:33 - program to crash like it just did there
02:35 - so here I'm going to put a try like this
02:38 - followed by a colon and then I'm going
02:41 - to indent these two blocks right here so
02:46 - that means we're going to try this block
02:48 - of code okay and then underneath here
02:51 - I'm going to type except just like that
02:54 - followed by a colon now there is a more
02:57 - advanced way to do this we can accept a
02:58 - specific type of error but I'm not going
03:01 - to talk about that in this video this is
03:02 - just a very basic try and accept block
03:04 - and then under here I'm going to type
03:08 - what I want to happen if this block of
03:10 - code doesn't run meaning this block of
03:12 - code returns an error and we can't
03:15 - actually execute it so in this case I'm
03:17 - just going to do I'll just print to the
03:20 - screen invalid username because remember
03:26 - we're only going to have our username
03:27 - contain numbers all right so now if I
03:30 - run the program and I try to type in
03:32 - something that is not a string so just I
03:34 - mean that is not a number like this it
03:38 - will just say invalid username rather
03:40 - than crashing the program which is what
03:42 - happened before and if I do try to type
03:45 - in something that is valid so maybe I
03:47 - type one two three four it just gives me
03:49 - that username back right so it works
03:51 - like that um so that's pretty much how
03:54 - we try and accept works again this is a
03:57 - very basic example that's what I try to
03:59 - do in my videos just give you the basics
04:01 - and then you can try to apply it to some
04:03 - projects you're doing and some more
04:05 - advanced things so again what happens is
04:08 - it tries this block of code if that
04:11 - block of code doesn't run or an error
04:13 - happens instead of simply crashing the
04:16 - program and giving us that red message
04:18 - it's going to go to this except block
04:20 - and it's going to do whatever's in here
04:21 - now in this except block again we could
04:24 - ask them to type in a new username we
04:27 - display another message we could maybe
04:30 - close the program on them we could do
04:32 - whatever we want to do in this accept
04:33 - block and it's extremely useful so yeah
04:37 - that's pretty much how the try and
04:39 - accept works if you've learned something
04:42 - please like and subscribe and I will see
04:45 - you again in another video
