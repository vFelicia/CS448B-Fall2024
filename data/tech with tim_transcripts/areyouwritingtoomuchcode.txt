00:11 - done while still staying productive and

00:20 - some drop off in productivity for me
00:22 - that I noticed I start to get a bit

00:26 - get to that six hour mark where I start
00:28 - to see a more significant drop off and
00:30 - by the time I'm at seven eight Etc I'm
00:33 - now at maybe sixty percent fifty percent
00:35 - productivity and at that point my time
00:37 - is probably better spent doing something
