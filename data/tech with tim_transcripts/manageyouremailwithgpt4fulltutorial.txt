00:00 - if you're like me then you get a ton of
00:01 - emails you hate reading them and you
00:03 - especially hate replying if that's the
00:05 - case having an AI that can automatically
00:07 - respond to emails and manage your inbox
00:09 - is probably a pretty appealing
00:11 - proposition so in this video I'm going
00:13 - to show you exactly how we can make that
00:15 - an AI that can manage your inbox now
00:17 - this AI can do super simple things like
00:19 - summarize emails for you send you maybe
00:21 - a bulk email at the end of the week with
00:22 - the important ones you need to reply to
00:24 - or it could simply respond to specific
00:26 - emails it could delete emails it could
00:28 - send emails on your behalf it can do
00:30 - practically anything and in this video
00:32 - I'll show you how you get this setup
00:34 - done and then you can go and adjust this
00:35 - and make it as cool as you want now for
00:37 - this project specifically what we'll do
00:39 - is we'll connect to Gmail we'll
00:41 - authorize ourself and then we'll read
00:43 - new emails every day every two days
00:45 - whatever increment you want whenever we
00:47 - get a new email we'll take that content
00:49 - pass that to chat gbt chat gbt will then
00:52 - generate a response for us and then
00:53 - we'll send the email on our behalf now
00:55 - you can obviously filter the emails you
00:57 - could also maybe generate a draft
00:58 - instead of actually send get a bunch of
01:01 - customizations you can make but I'll
01:02 - keep it pretty simple here and allow you
01:04 - guys to adjust it as we go
01:06 - [Music]
01:09 - now to do all of this I'm going to use a
01:11 - platform called mines DB now you can
01:13 - click the link in the description and
01:14 - create a completely free account you do
01:15 - not need to pay for this I've teamed up
01:17 - with them for this video and they've
01:19 - sponsored it but I've worked with them
01:20 - on some other videos in the past and you
01:22 - guys seem to really enjoy the platform
01:23 - just to give you a quick bit of
01:25 - information on what this platform is
01:27 - essentially this platform allows you to
01:29 - write SQL like queries to generate AI
01:32 - models so what we can actually do is
01:34 - write an entire AI machine learning
01:37 - model based on openai and chat gbt in
01:40 - just a few lines of SQL like syntax now
01:42 - you can hook this up with a bunch of
01:44 - different data sources so in our case
01:45 - the data source is going to be our email
01:47 - inbox but in previous videos I did
01:49 - something like Twitter we could do
01:51 - something like slack messages we could
01:53 - connect this to mongodb or postgres and
01:55 - you can write all kinds of different AI
01:57 - models in this SQL like syntax so here
01:59 - chat box classification forecasting
02:01 - recommendation engine real time research
02:04 - and development and you can see that
02:05 - this is kind of the syntax right create
02:07 - chatbot this using whatever the
02:10 - information is here right let's go and
02:12 - see if they have another one here create
02:13 - a job a job is something that will run
02:15 - recurringly you guys get the hang of it
02:17 - really really cool and if you know
02:19 - anything about SQL this makes it super
02:21 - powerful to actually work with your data
02:23 - and really quickly create machine
02:25 - learning models based on it without
02:26 - having to really know a lot about the
02:28 - implementation details hence why we're
02:30 - going to use it here anyways let's make
02:32 - a new account let's hop into kind of the
02:33 - cloud editor here from minesdb and I'll
02:36 - show you step by step what we need to do
02:37 - to make this AI that can manage our
02:40 - inbox alright so once you've made your
02:41 - free account then you should be brought
02:43 - to a page that looks like this which is
02:45 - the mindsdb cloud editor now to give you
02:47 - a bit of information on how all of this
02:49 - works you can write all of the code that
02:51 - you need and generate all the machine
02:53 - learning models and all that kind of
02:54 - stuff directly from the web you don't
02:56 - need to set anything up locally however
02:58 - if you do have a model that you want to
02:59 - be using in production then what you're
03:01 - able to do is actually connect to the
03:03 - mindsdb host from something like python
03:06 - JavaScript whatever it is and you can
03:08 - then ping the uh the API or you can ping
03:10 - the machine learning model sorry and it
03:12 - will return to whatever data you want
03:14 - now I'll put a video on the screen that
03:15 - kind of shows you how to do that this is
03:17 - another video on the channel that uses
03:19 - mindsdb for now though we actually won't
03:21 - need to leave this window everything can
03:23 - be done here and directly automate the
03:25 - inbox all right so how do we get started
03:27 - well the first thing with mindsdb is we
03:29 - need to add a data source so you can go
03:30 - here and click on new data source you
03:32 - also could upload a file or a machine
03:33 - learning model and you can go through
03:35 - here and kind of select one of the I
03:37 - think like over 130 data sources that
03:39 - they currently support so pretty much
03:41 - any place you could imagine you can
03:42 - connect to in our case we want to
03:44 - connect to Gmail so I'm actually not
03:46 - going to use this graphical editor
03:47 - instead we're going to write some syntax
03:49 - that will connect to our Gmail account
03:51 - now in order to connect to the Gmail
03:52 - account we actually need to generate
03:54 - something known as an app password now
03:56 - this isn't the most secure way in the
03:58 - world to do this so be careful if you're
04:00 - going to be running production
04:00 - applications with this however to
04:03 - generate an app password we're going to
04:05 - go to our Gmail account so you can go to
04:07 - my account.google.com that will bring up
04:09 - whatever Gmail account you're currently
04:11 - signed into now obviously you can change
04:12 - your account from the top right hand
04:13 - corner just by signing in signing out
04:16 - Etc but I don't want to leak my accounts
04:18 - so I won't do that and what we can do is
04:19 - simply search app password like this in
04:22 - the top bar here and click on app
04:24 - passwords which will be under the
04:25 - security pane now I need to sign in so
04:27 - let me sign in and then I'll show you
04:29 - how we generate the password alright so
04:30 - once you're brought to this page then
04:32 - what you're able to do is click on
04:33 - select app choose what you want in our
04:36 - case it's going to be mail right because
04:37 - we're generating this for Gmail and then
04:39 - you're going to pick a device you can
04:40 - just pick other it doesn't actually
04:41 - matter the device that you pick and then
04:43 - you can give this a name so something
04:45 - like server two whatever you want to
04:46 - name it right API Gmail Etc what will
04:49 - happen is you'll generate the app
04:50 - password and then you need to copy it
04:52 - directly because you won't be able to
04:54 - see it again now I already have one so
04:55 - I'm not going to do this but what you
04:57 - guys will do generate that app password
04:58 - once that app password is generated then
05:01 - we are good to go and we can go back to
05:02 - minesdb alright so to create the
05:05 - integration or the connection with our
05:07 - emails what we need to do is create a
05:09 - data source now I'm going to copy in
05:11 - some syntax here just to save us a
05:13 - little bit of time feel free to pause
05:14 - the video here and type this out so what
05:16 - we have here is create database and then
05:19 - the name of the database which in this
05:21 - case will be the email data source just
05:23 - keep it that name it'll be easier as you
05:24 - follow along with engine equal to email
05:28 - and then we pass in the parameters which
05:30 - are equal to some curly braces and then
05:32 - we pass our email and the app password
05:34 - for the email that we just generated so
05:37 - I'm going to go ahead and run this
05:38 - obviously I'll blur out my information
05:39 - here and then it will create a new data
05:41 - source for us this takes a second and
05:43 - once that data source is generated we
05:45 - can start running normal SQL queries to
05:47 - view the information in that data source
05:49 - so this data source will contain a bunch
05:51 - of our different emails and we can query
05:53 - them you know however we would normally
05:55 - query a database so what I can actually
05:56 - do here is write a select query and say
05:59 - select asterisks from and then this is
06:01 - going to be the email
06:04 - underscore data source dot emails like
06:08 - that when I run this we should see that
06:11 - we get a bunch of emails appearing kind
06:13 - of in this bottom terminal tab that I'm
06:15 - pulling up on the screen and we should
06:16 - see all the different columns and
06:18 - information in it now I'm hopefully not
06:19 - going to leak too much information when
06:21 - I do this but let's give it a second to
06:22 - run and then I'll show you the result
06:24 - alright so that query has finished
06:25 - running and you can see that it's giving
06:27 - me a bunch of different columns right ID
06:29 - created at 2 from subject body Etc now
06:33 - some of you may be saying okay well
06:34 - that's useful but I would want to use
06:35 - this in an app again you can actually
06:37 - connect to this from code there's all
06:39 - kinds of tutorials from mysdb regardless
06:41 - you see that we're getting some emails I
06:42 - don't really want to leak too much
06:44 - information but I think this is fine if
06:45 - you guys see you know monetization
06:46 - opportunity you can imagine the emails
06:48 - that I get and regardless now that we
06:50 - know how to select from there I'll just
06:51 - show you one more query that we'll
06:53 - select based on say a specific subject
06:55 - or something and then we can actually
06:56 - move on to looking at how to send emails
06:59 - and how to generate replies to specific
07:01 - emails so let me copy in another query
07:04 - here which to save us a bit of time so
07:06 - what I'm doing here is I'm selecting ID
07:08 - to subject body from email data
07:11 - source.emails where the subject is equal
07:13 - to something specific I'm ordering it by
07:15 - the ID and then I'm limiting limiting it
07:17 - sorry to five now this is just an
07:19 - example of a more compound query you can
07:21 - run that's going to have some more
07:22 - filters and checks in this case we're
07:24 - checking the subject we could check the
07:26 - to field we can check the from field uh
07:28 - there's a bunch of fields we can check
07:29 - right so anyways that's one I'm not
07:32 - going to run this just wanted to show
07:33 - you that that's another query you could
07:35 - use so now that we've done that let me
07:36 - show you quickly how we would send an
07:38 - email from something like minesdb then
07:40 - once we know how to read our emails and
07:42 - send emails we can combine those two
07:44 - together with that chat gbt integration
07:46 - which will allow us to generate the
07:48 - replies and then actually send them to
07:50 - specific emails alright so to send an
07:52 - email we're going to write the following
07:54 - query insert into email datasource dot
07:58 - emails to subject body now what we're
08:01 - putting here is the different parameters
08:03 - that we're going to have so in this case
08:04 - the two Fields is going to be this the
08:06 - subject is going to be this the body of
08:07 - the email is this right and then we have
08:09 - the values so we would put the email we
08:11 - want to send to the subject and then we
08:14 - put the body now I will change this to
08:16 - an email that I have access to that I
08:18 - can leak in fact we can just send this
08:20 - to the email that
08:21 - is available
08:24 - um at my YouTube description so that's
08:26 - not one that I'm leaking Tech with Tim
08:29 - at
08:31 - viralnationtalent.com don't email me you
08:34 - will get a reply from chat gbt just
08:35 - kidding anyways what I can do is run
08:37 - this here and I'll show you in a second
08:39 - when I go to my email that this will be
08:42 - generated right so we'll have this so
08:43 - let's go down here and see it says query
08:45 - successfully completed so I'll show you
08:46 - that new kind of unread or just sent
08:49 - email and then we'll move on alright so
08:51 - as you guys can see here the email was
08:52 - received and says hello from minesdb
08:55 - just sent zero minutes ago okay so that
08:57 - is working so now at this point we know
08:59 - how to read and send emails and we now
09:01 - need to start generating some replies
09:03 - which is going to involve using an AI
09:05 - table now ai tables are the
09:07 - implementation of machine learning
09:08 - models in mindstv they're very
09:11 - interesting because we can use SQL
09:12 - syntax to query the AI model so it seems
09:16 - a bit strange I know but it's actually
09:17 - really useful and super easy to work
09:19 - with because we can combine different
09:21 - queries with our data sources and take
09:23 - information from one row or from one
09:26 - table and pass that into the AI table
09:28 - which will then generate a reply or
09:30 - response for us in a new row or a new
09:32 - column depending on how we set it up
09:34 - you'll see what I mean I know that was
09:36 - probably a bit confusing what we're
09:37 - going to do is start creating a model so
09:40 - again I'm just going to copy in the
09:41 - syntax I know I'm copying a lot of stuff
09:43 - here but it's going to be faster than me
09:45 - typing all of it out and potentially
09:46 - making a mistake so what we do to create
09:49 - a new model is we say create model and
09:52 - then we say minesdb dot the name of the
09:55 - model in this case I'm naming it
09:56 - sponsorship reply now what I want to do
09:58 - is predict some field so I'm saying I'm
10:01 - predicting a response okay so this is
10:03 - the field that we will use when we
10:05 - actually want to get a response and you
10:07 - know use that as a reply to the email
10:08 - okay so create model mind CB does
10:11 - sponsorship reply we're essentially just
10:12 - naming the output column here which in
10:14 - this case is response and we're saying
10:15 - we're going to use a specific engine now
10:17 - there's all kinds of different engines
10:18 - we can use here in minesdb they have
10:21 - classification regression they probably
10:22 - have better ones for this use case but I
10:24 - love using chat GPT and open AI so
10:26 - that's the one that I went with so I
10:28 - said using engine equal to open AI Max
10:31 - tokens is 300 and then we need to pass
10:33 - the openai API key I'll show you how we
10:36 - get that in one second so we pass the
10:37 - API key we passed the model name this is
10:40 - the most recent one as of filming this
10:41 - video and then this is the most
10:43 - important part here that you'll adjust
10:44 - which is the prompt template now the
10:47 - prompt template is what we are
10:49 - essentially using as our AI model or our
10:52 - machine learning prompt so the way that
10:54 - I always use chat EBT is I'll just come
10:56 - up with a good prompt that contains some
10:58 - variable data in this case that variable
11:00 - data is the body of the email and it
11:03 - will then kind of do what I say as like
11:05 - a mock machine learning model I'm not
11:07 - sure if that makes sense but if I read
11:08 - this to you'll see what I mean so first
11:10 - determine if the following email is
11:12 - related to sponsorships if it is reply
11:14 - to the following email in a personalized
11:15 - polite and professional manner make sure
11:17 - to include my sponsorship rates and
11:18 - explain what each one is obviously these
11:20 - are fake but an insert maximum 60 second
11:23 - integration into a video costs ten
11:24 - dollars and a dedicated YouTube video
11:26 - costs fifty dollars if it is not related
11:28 - to sponsorships return the exact string
11:30 - of no reply here is the email and then
11:32 - this is the email right here which is
11:34 - the body of the email okay so I'm asking
11:37 - Chad gbd to First tell me okay is this
11:39 - related to sponsorships if it is give me
11:42 - the reply and then we'll generate the
11:43 - reply and send that to the person okay
11:46 - so now that we have that what we'll need
11:48 - to do is generate this API key and
11:51 - obviously you guys will write this
11:52 - prompt template based on what you want
11:54 - to occur
11:55 - um for chat gbt right or for the AI
11:57 - model so if you wanted to talk about you
12:00 - know why they should come visit your
12:01 - storefront or you wanted to just reply
12:03 - to people and tell them to call your
12:05 - phone number whatever you wanted to do
12:06 - that's what you would put in the prompt
12:08 - template right you specify what kind of
12:10 - reply you want in my case I've specified
12:12 - this is the reply and it will make it
12:14 - personalized based on the person that
12:16 - sent the email okay so how do we get
12:18 - this API key well let me go to the
12:20 - openai website and I will show you
12:22 - alright so what we need to do to get our
12:24 - openai API key is we first need to have
12:26 - an account with openai I assume most of
12:28 - you probably already do if you're using
12:30 - chat EBT and then we're going to go to
12:33 - platform.openai.com okay I'll leave this
12:35 - link in the description from here we'll
12:36 - click on the settings we'll go to view
12:38 - API keys and then what we can do is
12:40 - generate a new key now you can see I
12:42 - already have a key obviously I will
12:43 - delete this after the video so that you
12:45 - guys don't steal it but you click create
12:47 - secret key give it a name and then it
12:49 - will generate a key for you which you
12:50 - can copy and use wherever you would like
12:52 - okay so that's it that's how you get the
12:54 - API key also can just go directly to
12:56 - this link
12:57 - platform.openai.com account slash API
13:00 - Keys okay now we have our API key you
13:02 - know we paste that inside of here and we
13:04 - can just go ahead and run this and it's
13:05 - going to start generating a model for us
13:07 - once the model is generated I'll show
13:09 - you how we use it with this SQL query
13:11 - which is quite useful so after a few
13:13 - seconds here this model should be
13:15 - finished you can actually check if it's
13:16 - done by going to minesdb over here
13:18 - models and you can see sponsorship
13:20 - replies here there's also a query that
13:22 - you can use for that but I'm not going
13:23 - to show that to you right now anyways
13:25 - the model is finished and the way we use
13:27 - this is we just query it like a normal
13:29 - SQL table now this will seem a bit weird
13:32 - but I'm just going to paste in a query
13:33 - here and explain this to you so I'm
13:35 - saying select body response from
13:38 - mindcb.sponsorship reply which is the
13:40 - name of the model we just made right
13:42 - where body is equal to and then we
13:46 - specify in here the body that we wanted
13:48 - to generate a reply for now that's
13:50 - because remember when we generate the
13:52 - model inside of those double curly
13:53 - braces which represents a variable this
13:56 - is the prompt template we named it body
13:58 - right so if I go back here you can see
14:00 - that we have body so if we add two
14:03 - variables like body and then we had
14:05 - subject then we would pass multiple
14:08 - where Clauses so let me paste this back
14:09 - in we'd say where body equals that and
14:13 - subject is equal to this right so you
14:15 - would pass multiple variables in this
14:17 - case we're just passing one variable
14:19 - okay so select body response from
14:21 - mindtv.sponsorship apply where the body
14:23 - is equal to this response will be that
14:25 - output column and it will run that chat
14:27 - GPT kind of prompt on this and then give
14:30 - us whatever the response from chat gbt
14:32 - was so let's run this here
14:35 - and give this a second and let's see
14:38 - what it actually says for the reply all
14:39 - right so we have the body here all right
14:41 - and then if we go over here to response
14:43 - we can see that it says I'm pleased to
14:44 - provide you with our sponsorship rates
14:46 - and then it kind of says all this here
14:48 - dedicated video please know these rates
14:50 - are subject to change if you have any
14:51 - specific requirements blah blah blah
14:53 - best regards and then we could have put
14:54 - this in the template right to say you
14:56 - know reply as Tim rosica from this
14:59 - company blah blah blah and we can fine
15:01 - tune that template as much as we want
15:02 - and kind of keep remaking the model all
15:05 - right so anyways that is how that works
15:08 - so we now are able to generate a reply
15:10 - now the interesting part comes when we
15:12 - start hooking this up with our email
15:14 - data source what we can do now is we can
15:17 - actually query our email data source and
15:19 - then we can combine that with a query to
15:21 - our sponsorship reply so it's like
15:23 - joining a table in SQL right that's what
15:25 - we can do and then we can keep
15:27 - generating that response column output
15:29 - so that we can see what the replies
15:31 - would be for the emails we actually have
15:33 - in our inbox so I'm going to paste in a
15:35 - pretty complex query here but this will
15:37 - do exactly what I just described where
15:39 - again we're kind of combining the AI
15:42 - table which is really what it's called
15:44 - with our data source and then generating
15:46 - a column or an output for every single
15:49 - piece of our data source with that AI
15:51 - table all right so I've just pasted in
15:53 - the query here let's kind of run through
15:55 - it so select asterisks from and then we
15:57 - have an inner or kind of compound query
15:59 - in here where we're saying select eatup
16:01 - audio's body r dot response as reply and
16:04 - then e dot subject from email data
16:07 - source dot emails as e join
16:10 - mindsdb.sponsorship reply as R so again
16:13 - if you're familiar with query or with
16:14 - SQL Server now with query what we're
16:16 - doing is joining the tables together
16:17 - where now what will happen is the AI
16:19 - table will generate a reply column for
16:22 - every single body entry that it has here
16:25 - then we'll say where e dot subject is
16:27 - equal to this the reason I put this here
16:28 - is I only want a generator reply for one
16:31 - specific email this is just for the
16:33 - video but for you guys you could remove
16:34 - this right you can keep this order by
16:37 - and then you can limit it to say 10 just
16:39 - so it doesn't take forever to run so
16:41 - that's the query all we have to do
16:43 - really is just join a data source with
16:45 - the AI table it might take a little bit
16:47 - of experimenting to come up with the
16:48 - correct query and then you'll see that
16:50 - it will generate replies for all of the
16:52 - emails that are in our data source so
16:54 - let me go ahead and run this uh we'll
16:56 - give it a second to complete and then I
16:58 - will show you the result alright so I
17:00 - just changed the query a little bit to
17:02 - get it to work because for some reason
17:03 - it wasn't finding that other email
17:05 - subject that's possible I deleted that
17:07 - email regardless we have this here which
17:10 - is an email I get a lot actually and
17:12 - anyways uh you can see that it has the
17:15 - body and then if we go over here it has
17:18 - the reply now I won't go through the
17:19 - whole reply because it does actually
17:21 - leak the person's name so I don't want
17:23 - to put that in the video but you can see
17:25 - it gives us that reply column which was
17:26 - generated by the AI table so that's
17:29 - exactly how you would do this in terms
17:31 - of mixing the two tables together
17:33 - obviously you can write more complex SQL
17:35 - queries and you can filter this better
17:37 - so you're only replying to specific
17:39 - emails like it's a certain sender it's a
17:41 - certain body it you know text is
17:43 - contained in here whatever you want to
17:45 - do that's valid SQL syntax so now at
17:48 - this point we know how to actually
17:50 - generate this query the last thing we
17:52 - need to do is make it so that we do all
17:54 - this but then we actually send an email
17:56 - so that would be one additional step
17:58 - where now we're combining this with that
18:00 - send email syntax so we generate the
18:02 - reply and then we actually send that
18:04 - reply to the person now we want to do
18:06 - this on some kind of increment right
18:08 - every hour every two hours every day so
18:11 - we're going to use something in mindsdb
18:12 - called jobs now jobs are just like cron
18:15 - jobs pretty much where they'll run
18:17 - whatever increment you set them at and
18:19 - it's super useful because we don't need
18:20 - to set up a server or handle anything
18:21 - ourself mindsdb can just take care of it
18:24 - for us so again I'm going to paste in
18:26 - another large piece of syntax by the way
18:28 - I'll try to keep all of this kind of in
18:30 - the description below so you guys can
18:31 - copy it in alright so this is the code
18:34 - here we're going to write create job
18:36 - minesdb dot email reply what's the name
18:39 - of the job as and then we put the query
18:41 - inside of here that we actually want to
18:43 - run so what we're doing is inserting
18:45 - into the email data source dot emails
18:48 - the two subject body now what that's
18:51 - going to do is take two so who we're
18:53 - sending it to the subject of the email
18:54 - then the content and add that in and
18:57 - then we're selecting e.2 e dot subject
19:00 - and s dot response as the body so now
19:03 - you can see we're saying from email data
19:05 - source dot emails e that means we're
19:07 - labeling this as e where we're getting
19:08 - the 2 and the subject from We're then
19:10 - joining that to the AI table
19:13 - minesdbe.sponsorship reply labeling that
19:15 - as s and getting the response for every
19:18 - single email that matches this query
19:21 - here we're then going to insert the
19:22 - reply into the email data source it will
19:24 - actually send that email now what I'm
19:26 - doing here is just having a where Clause
19:27 - I say where edot subject is equal to the
19:30 - following just so we only reply to that
19:32 - email and then we're limiting this to
19:33 - 10. now obviously you could remove the
19:35 - if you want and then you'd be replying
19:37 - to every single email anyways we'll put
19:40 - those back here and that is pretty much
19:42 - it we're then doing the time increment
19:44 - and we're saying we're going to run this
19:45 - job every single day for this specific
19:48 - job the minimum increment is day so you
19:50 - can't do something like hour uh you can
19:52 - actually only do day I tested this out
19:53 - previously and that's the one that works
19:55 - in terms of the minimum increment okay
19:58 - so that is all the code again this will
19:59 - be available from the link in the
20:01 - description if you wanted to test this
20:02 - out by the way before you actually start
20:04 - sending emails to random people you can
20:06 - go here to the to field and you can just
20:08 - fill in your email no actually we need
20:09 - single quotes here but you could do
20:11 - something like Tim at techwithtim.net
20:13 - and then you'd be able to test and see
20:15 - if all these replies are good maybe you
20:17 - want to forward the replies whatever you
20:18 - want to do but this is a way that you
20:19 - could actually test it out now I'm not
20:21 - going to run this job because I've
20:23 - already tested it it's working and well
20:25 - I don't want it running right now but
20:26 - obviously you would just run the query
20:28 - it would go ahead and create this job
20:30 - and now I'll show you actually how you
20:31 - would delete the job what you can do is
20:33 - you can write drop job and if you write
20:36 - drop job that's going to delete it so if
20:38 - for some reason you want to get rid of
20:39 - it once you make it you can just do drop
20:41 - job and then you are good to go alright
20:44 - so I think with that said that's going
20:45 - to wrap up this video I know there's a
20:47 - bit of complexity here there's a bunch
20:48 - of queries stuff you're going to have to
20:50 - copy in obviously it's just not that
20:52 - easy to make an AI that manages your
20:54 - inbox however with minesdb we could do
20:56 - this relatively fast compared if we had
20:58 - to code this on our own and I will try
21:01 - to leave all of the syntax that I
21:02 - mentioned in this video in the
21:03 - description down below I hope I have
21:05 - enough space there so you guys can just
21:06 - copy it directly from there rather than
21:08 - having to type everything in anyways if
21:10 - you guys enjoyed make sure to leave a
21:12 - like subscribe to the channel again
21:13 - check out my instb from the link in the
21:15 - description thanks to them for
21:17 - sponsoring this video and I look forward
21:18 - to seeing you in another one
