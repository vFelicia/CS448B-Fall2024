00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to the fourth
00:02 - and final video in my PI game a side
00:05 - scroller series in today's video I'm
00:06 - going to be doing the finishing touches
00:08 - on our game so that's gonna include
00:09 - adding some sort of scoring mechanism
00:12 - and then adding an end screen and kind
00:15 - of fixing touching up a few bugs making
00:17 - a few tweaks I'm just gonna say right
00:20 - now that everything I do in this video
00:21 - you guys don't have to do this you can
00:23 - change any of the aspects you'd like if
00:25 - you want to make the game of a different
00:26 - experiment with things feel free to do
00:28 - that and I encourage you to do that
00:29 - because the more that you can learn by
00:31 - yourself the more you're gonna retain
00:32 - that information
00:33 - so pretty much again I'm not gonna be
00:35 - making everything perfect in this video
00:37 - there are a few glitches I'm aware of so
00:39 - I encourage you guys to try to fix them
00:41 - on your own and to add new things into
00:42 - the game this is just trying to give you
00:44 - a good starting point for where you can
00:46 - hopefully create a more complex game in
00:48 - the future so I'm gonna show you a quick
00:50 - what do you called example of what I
00:52 - have so I've already coated this and I'm
00:54 - just looking off my other screen and
00:56 - kind of explaining it so that I don't
00:58 - get sidetracked in this video you can
00:59 - see already at the top here we have our
01:01 - score and I've tweaked the hitboxes a
01:03 - little bit in here and you can see we
01:07 - can now slide underneath this and keep
01:10 - sliding and then if I hit it I will fall
01:12 - over and you can see we're brought to
01:15 - kind of an end screen here where it says
01:16 - this is our best score and this is the
01:18 - score we just received again the screen
01:21 - is not very pretty it doesn't show much
01:22 - I'm just simply doing this to show you
01:25 - how you can cut a time out an end screen
01:26 - does everything works with your game and
01:29 - then if I click down on the most button
01:30 - it just resets the game and I'm able to
01:32 - try again a nice thing I kind of would
01:34 - want to add is maybe just at the bottom
01:36 - say press the mouse button to continue
01:38 - so that if someone were to be playing
01:40 - this game and they didn't know what to
01:42 - do or they didn't create the game then
01:44 - they would know what to do again that's
01:45 - a good so you can see that he kind of
01:47 - flies up I'm not gonna worry about that
01:48 - too much you guys can feel free to fix
01:50 - that in your own thing so that's what
01:52 - its gonna look like and let's get right
01:53 - into the code now so the first thing I
01:56 - want to do is just fix a glitch that I
01:57 - noticed as I was writing this next
01:59 - section here and that's gonna come up a
02:01 - lot when you guys are making games
02:02 - you're gonna code something and there's
02:04 - no possible way again that you can think
02:06 - of every situation so we're just gonna
02:07 - fix this really small I'm gonna copy
02:10 - where we're in
02:11 - runner class here at player class and it
02:14 - says self thoughtful now what I want to
02:16 - do here is pretty much this is when we
02:19 - say that our player is falling we want
02:22 - to display that image of them falling
02:24 - now what ends up happening if I as I
02:26 - have this here in this program is if we
02:29 - are to like be jumping in the air and
02:31 - then we hit a saw our players gonna
02:32 - finish the jump and then he's gonna
02:34 - start falling so if you want it to stay
02:37 - that way where you still see the
02:39 - animation of him finishing the jump and
02:41 - then there's a slight delay and he falls
02:43 - afterwards then you can leave like this
02:45 - but what I'm gonna do is just make it so
02:47 - what the second he hits an object he's
02:49 - gonna look like you fell so you know
02:50 - exactly where you kind of messed up in
02:52 - the game so I'm just gonna copy this and
02:54 - I'm going to paste it up at the very top
02:57 - of our draw method here like that
02:58 - now we do just have to change this so
03:01 - get rid of the Yale we're gonna say if
03:02 - and then where it says self jumping I'm
03:05 - gonna type in Elif now what this is
03:07 - doing is just changing the sequence so
03:09 - we're first gonna check if the players
03:10 - falling and then if he's falling we're
03:12 - gonna do this this is the reason why he
03:14 - doesn't continue to move down as as he's
03:18 - falling like once he hits an object it
03:20 - just starts splitting his falling body
03:22 - so if you want it the other way just
03:24 - leave it like that but yeah that's the
03:25 - first kind of bug fix in my opinion
03:27 - we're gonna be doing that's all we're
03:28 - gonna be touching really in the running
03:30 - class now what we need to do here is
03:32 - figure out what's gonna happen once our
03:34 - player falls so before we just had it
03:36 - delayed the game for like a few seconds
03:38 - or like I'm so that we could see that
03:41 - our player had fell had fallen what I
03:43 - want to happen is a screen to continue
03:45 - to keep scrolling and then a few seconds
03:48 - later it pops up that end screen so what
03:50 - you saw in my program so the way we're
03:52 - gonna do this is just we need to create
03:54 - a few new variables here so the first
03:57 - one I'm gonna create is just gonna be
03:58 - called pause I'm gonna set this equal to
04:00 - zero we're simply gonna use this just to
04:02 - increment our our time so we don't
04:05 - actually delay like we were before now
04:07 - I'm gonna send another variable
04:08 - full-speed I'm just gonna set this equal
04:10 - to zero for now and what I'm gonna do is
04:12 - when our object collides with our runner
04:15 - I'm just gonna say that fall speed is
04:20 - equal to speed just like that okay and
04:22 - what we're gonna come back to that
04:24 - now I'm also going to add in one thing
04:27 - here which is just gonna say if pause
04:31 - equals equals zero and then I'm gonna
04:34 - indent this in and then we're gonna say
04:37 - pause plus equals one like that okay so
04:41 - if pause is equal to zero we're gonna
04:43 - increment pause to be plus one we're
04:46 - actually gonna make it sorry not plus
04:47 - one we're gonna make it equal to one and
04:49 - reset the false speed equal to speed now
04:50 - I'm gonna explain how this works in a
04:52 - second but it's easier just to type it
04:53 - all out right now now up at the top
04:55 - right underneath I redraw window we're
04:57 - gonna see if pause is greater than zero
05:02 - but we're gonna increment to pause so
05:04 - pause two plus equals one and then after
05:06 - that we're gonna say if pause it's
05:10 - greater than false speed times two and
05:14 - I'm gonna get to that in a minute
05:16 - then entry okay now this we haven't
05:21 - created yet I'm just typing this in for
05:22 - now we're gonna get to that in a second
05:23 - so that reset function I have here I'm
05:25 - actually gonna change the name of that
05:26 - to n-screen
05:26 - so let's just explain what I've done
05:28 - here pretty well so what's gonna happen
05:30 - now is once our player collides with
05:32 - with an object we're gonna check first
05:35 - of all to see if pause which is a new
05:37 - variable we created is equal to zero now
05:39 - if that is true then that means we
05:41 - haven't already collided with an object
05:43 - okay because if pause is set to zero at
05:46 - the beginning so once that happens we're
05:48 - gonna set our full speed equal to our
05:50 - current speed so say for example our
05:52 - current speed is like 35 that's how many
05:54 - frames per second removing that's gonna
05:56 - be set and stored in full speed this
05:58 - needs to be speed not sped or whatever
06:00 - had there and then we're setting pause
06:01 - equal to one so that this isn't gonna
06:03 - keep resetting because if we don't set
06:05 - pause equal to one then pause is still
06:07 - going to be zero and it's gonna keep
06:08 - changing our fall speed to our speed
06:10 - even after we've fallen um I hope you
06:12 - hopefully can understand that now up
06:14 - here what this is gonna do is we're
06:15 - saying if pause is greater than zero
06:17 - meaning if it's equal to one pretty well
06:18 - or two or whatever then we're gonna
06:21 - increment pause now what this is doing
06:23 - is we're only going to change this
06:25 - variable pause once we've started
06:27 - falling because that's gonna be the
06:28 - delay for how long we should wait until
06:31 - we move on to our end screen we say if
06:34 - it's greater than zero incremented and
06:35 - then we were checking now if pause is
06:37 - greater than false
06:38 - speed times 2 now what this does is it
06:41 - pretty much says that whatever our speed
06:42 - is so say our speed is like 27 frames
06:45 - per second we're gonna multiply it by 2
06:47 - now what that's going to give us is
06:49 - equivalent of two seconds there about
06:52 - two seconds so when we get to the higher
06:55 - speeds if we had just set this to a
06:57 - constant for example a hundred and where
06:59 - maybe we're running at a speed of 100
07:01 - frames per second then the delay is
07:03 - gonna be really short so I want this to
07:05 - be equal to whatever the speed is when
07:08 - we fell so that it's gonna change
07:09 - dynamically based on how fast we're
07:11 - moving it's kind of hmm maybe a complex
07:14 - idea but just throw that in there for
07:16 - now it's not really that important to
07:18 - understand okay and then what I want to
07:20 - do is I'm just gonna put this redraw
07:22 - window at the bottom of our wall appear
07:24 - I should have done this at the very
07:25 - beginning but I just I don't know why
07:27 - I'm I'm gonna put it actually underneath
07:28 - our clock tick here
07:29 - I like that redraw window okay just to
07:32 - clean things up a bit and then that
07:35 - should be it for you know a while loop
07:37 - at least for right now now we need to go
07:40 - to our end screen so what what I have
07:41 - here is I'm going to change this reset
07:43 - to end screen and then inside of our end
07:47 - screen to make sure that we stay inside
07:48 - of our end screen we need another well
07:50 - loop so in the end screen what's gonna
07:52 - happen is we're gonna reset a few
07:54 - variables so that our game will be able
07:56 - to reset when we move out of the end
07:57 - screen and then we're gonna just do what
07:59 - we've done down below or that's a run is
08:01 - equal to true pretty much copy a bit of
08:04 - our loop here I'm just gonna say well
08:05 - done and then for event in PI game down
08:11 - event oops don't get and then again if
08:16 - event dot type equals equals PI game got
08:19 - quit we always want our user to be able
08:20 - to leave the game if possible don't quit
08:22 - and that we say Ronnie equals false PI
08:27 - game dot quit like so okay and then
08:30 - after this we're gonna do another else
08:32 - if statement or say if event got type
08:35 - equals equals PI game oops
08:38 - equal sign dot all capitals Mouse motion
08:42 - not Mouse motion mouse button down
08:48 - then we were gonna say run is equal to
08:52 - false now what this is gonna do is it's
08:54 - pretty much means whenever we click any
08:55 - of the mouse buttons so right left
08:57 - middle mouse button side mouse buttons
08:59 - whatever then we're gonna exit this loop
09:01 - and when we exit this loop we now exit
09:03 - this function so it's because we're
09:05 - exiting that function then we just
09:06 - continue on with the rest of our loop
09:07 - and everything's gonna be reset so it's
09:10 - gonna look like we just started a new
09:11 - game when in reality we're just running
09:13 - through the same loop we're just kind of
09:14 - moving on to a different screen okay
09:17 - that's pretty good
09:18 - now L so in this wall loop we want to
09:20 - draw some other things so I'll get to
09:22 - that in a second but let's just first
09:23 - put a delay in here so that our loop
09:24 - doesn't run super fast do delay and
09:30 - maybe we'll do like a hundred we don't
09:32 - need to go that fast consider all we're
09:34 - gonna do is just click a button and then
09:36 - we can get to drawing everything in just
09:38 - a second so let's just run the program
09:41 - really quickly and see what's happening
09:42 - so far so you can see we've got our
09:44 - player I can run you can jump I can
09:48 - slide whatever now let's see what
09:50 - happens when he hits the saw just test
09:52 - everything out again hits the saw you
09:55 - can see he falls over we wait we wait we
09:58 - wait and then it calls the end screen I
10:01 - believe so maybe we aren't calling
10:03 - on-screen let's just check this year
10:05 - quickly if paul is greater than full
10:07 - speed times two and screen Oh
10:11 - so we've spelled two paused wrong that's
10:14 - great that's the issue okay so we
10:16 - actually just create a new variable
10:17 - instead of a setting Paul is equal to
10:19 - one that would explain why things
10:20 - happening well I run into a lot of
10:22 - errors with spelling mistakes here don't
10:23 - I okay so to give it a second again to
10:25 - see what's happening we'll just collide
10:28 - with these objects and see if we get to
10:32 - our end screen
10:33 - okay so we fall in one two there we go
10:36 - okay it's paused perfect so you can see
10:39 - the game is just pause now if I click
10:41 - the mouse button it it continues so the
10:43 - reason why it's like lagging like this
10:45 - because we haven't reset any the
10:46 - variables but you can see after that
10:48 - two-second delay about we've we pause
10:51 - the screen so that goal has been
10:52 - accomplished so now let's move on to the
10:53 - next step
10:54 - sorry about that a little issue before
10:56 - okay so now we're in our end screen so
10:58 - once we're in our n screen we want to
10:59 - display a mess
11:01 - we want to say like press this button to
11:03 - continue so on we also want to reset a
11:05 - few variables so if we want to reset
11:07 - variables from a function that we've
11:09 - defined down here we can't simply just
11:11 - type for example Paul is equal to zero
11:14 - because if we do this what actually ends
11:17 - up happening is it creates a new
11:18 - variable in this function which is local
11:21 - to this function rather than resetting
11:23 - this puzzle so what we need to do to
11:25 - start is you need to start by typing
11:26 - global and I know the name of all the
11:28 - variables that we want to be able to
11:30 - change and access so we'll do objects
11:33 - and then I guess we will do speed as
11:37 - well like that okay so now we're gonna
11:39 - change we're gonna say objects equals a
11:42 - blank list the reason we do this is so
11:44 - that when we spawn back in we don't see
11:46 - any objects on our screen and then speed
11:48 - again equal to 30 and that should be
11:51 - good for right now
11:53 - we don't need to worry about changing
11:54 - any of the attributes of the player of
11:56 - the runner so everything should be fun
11:57 - at that and now what we want to do in
11:59 - here is we want to draw everything so
12:01 - usually I would say draw everything from
12:03 - a function but because we're doing it
12:05 - just one time in this loop it's fine to
12:08 - draw it inside of the loop and we're
12:10 - gonna start by just drawing the
12:10 - background so wind up blitz background
12:13 - to zero just to reset everything so it's
12:16 - like Conant clears the screen if you
12:18 - make a font object here so that we can
12:20 - display some fonts a large font is equal
12:22 - to PI game got fog dot sys font and then
12:28 - in here you guys know I like comics and
12:31 - we'll use that one sighs oops give a
12:36 - size of eighty and we're gonna render
12:38 - some volunteers so let's just say
12:40 - previous score which we're gonna find in
12:43 - a second is equal to large font
12:48 - rendering and then we'll render up let's
12:53 - say previous score plus actually we'll
12:59 - just leave a previous score for now
13:00 - because I'm going to get to in a second
13:01 - comma 1 comma and then whatever color
13:05 - you want so in this case I'm going to do
13:06 - white and then we'll do our next thing
13:09 - where you need to blip this onto the
13:10 - screen so we're going to say win double
13:12 - it
13:13 - previous score and then you guys should
13:17 - know hopefully how we can get this go in
13:19 - the middle of the screen I think I've
13:20 - done this a few times maybe not in this
13:22 - series but in another series of mine
13:23 - the way that we can do this is simply by
13:25 - taking the width of the screen dividing
13:27 - it by two and then subtracting it from
13:29 - the width of our object so in this case
13:31 - I'm just gonna copy this in to save me a
13:32 - bit of typing here as you can see we
13:34 - have width which is our variable
13:36 - containing the width of the screen
13:37 - divided by 2 and then subtract the
13:40 - previous score with divided by 2 for
13:43 - height in here what should our height be
13:46 - let's see we'll just give it a height
13:48 - static of 200 we can play around with
13:51 - that after now we also want to blit our
13:52 - new score which we still haven't even
13:54 - defined yet so we'll do that in a second
13:56 - so let's just define here new score and
14:01 - that's equal to again we're gonna render
14:04 - this and I'm just gonna copy this say me
14:05 - at a time like that we'll do score cuz
14:11 - it's your current score again we're
14:12 - gonna add to that in a second to what
14:14 - the score actually is and then it will
14:16 - copy this one more time so that we can
14:19 - bleed it onto the screen change the name
14:22 - of course to new score and then we'll
14:25 - change the height to let's say like 320
14:28 - maybe all right there we go now we just
14:31 - need to update this screen so pygame
14:33 - display dot update like so and that
14:37 - should be about it for what we're
14:39 - putting in our what we're drawing onto
14:41 - the thing now I still haven't defined
14:43 - what our score is gonna be and how we're
14:45 - actually gonna score now the way we're
14:47 - gonna do that is based off speed so
14:48 - pretty much every time we go up by 10 in
14:50 - speed we're gonna go up by one and score
14:52 - that's the way I want to do it or we can
14:54 - do it maybe by five so that the scores
14:56 - are higher let's let's do that actually
14:58 - so at the top of my function here or not
15:01 - function loop I'm just gonna say score
15:03 - is equal to and then speed integer
15:06 - division 5 we remember what integer
15:09 - division does right and then we're just
15:11 - gonna subtract 6 from it now the reason
15:13 - we're subtracting 6 is because because
15:14 - we start at a speed of 30 and I don't
15:17 - want you to start with a score of 6
15:19 - because if we do 30 divided by 5 we get
15:21 - 6 so it has to be relative to what we've
15:24 - started out so by subtracting 6
15:26 - as we're at 30 we're gonna start with
15:28 - the scores you okay we have the score
15:30 - now and then up here we can now just add
15:33 - plus str score like that
15:37 - now I'm also just gonna throw score up
15:39 - here in our global so we can change it
15:42 - and then at the bottom outside of our
15:44 - while loop
15:44 - so once we've exit the while loop we're
15:46 - gonna reset the score equal to zero just
15:49 - by doing that okay everything should be
15:53 - good now score equals speed and then we
15:56 - also need to draw the score on to the
15:58 - screen right so just like you saw on my
16:00 - other program we were just bleeding the
16:02 - score in our redraw window here so what
16:05 - I'm gonna do is just make another font
16:07 - objects let's say font equals PI game
16:10 - don't font dot sys font again Comic Sans
16:15 - my go-to I will make it about 30 big
16:18 - this time and I will render it out so
16:20 - let's say text is equal to what render
16:24 - in this case we're just gonna use the
16:26 - string
16:26 - score and before that we want to put
16:30 - like a little thing before that it says
16:32 - score plus sign of course and then 1 and
16:38 - color white again and then after that we
16:43 - need to of course put this on the screen
16:44 - so we'll just say wind up Blitz text and
16:48 - where do we want to put it let's put it
16:50 - about 700 and then 10 okay and that
16:55 - should be good let's now run the program
16:57 - and see if we run into any errors there
16:59 - we go okay so we can see we have score
17:01 - now up at the top of the screen and
17:02 - every frot every time we increment by 5
17:06 - we get the score going up by one so we
17:09 - can see here everything looks to be
17:11 - working fine if I hit an object I fall
17:13 - over we wait the delay and then we have
17:15 - previous score and we have score awesome
17:18 - everything should be everything is
17:19 - looking good here now the only thing
17:21 - that CSU is we need to fix what previous
17:23 - scores and we need to fix the position
17:24 - of score the reason scores like that is
17:27 - just I just realized I messed up on one
17:29 - thing here so I copied and pasted this
17:30 - but I didn't change the name of previous
17:32 - score changes to new score and then we
17:34 - should have that working and we also
17:36 - need to figure out what our previous
17:37 - score is going to be now what I'm gonna
17:38 - do for our previous score is I'm some
17:40 - I'm gonna write it into a text file so
17:42 - in Python it's really cool and really
17:44 - simple you can write stuff into text
17:46 - files really easily and that's what
17:47 - we're gonna save our score you could
17:49 - save other attributes in there as well
17:50 - say if you have like characters that
17:51 - you're unlocking or something and you
17:53 - want to save which ones were there so
17:54 - what I'm gonna do here is I'm just gonna
17:55 - simply open up the folder one which I
17:57 - have the game in you can see I already
17:59 - have a text file that I've called scores
18:01 - text if you don't know how to create a
18:02 - new text file it's really easy to just
18:04 - go new and then find text file here text
18:07 - document and go ahead and there you go
18:10 - you can name it and you don't even need
18:11 - to put anything in it so just name your
18:13 - scores don't text like that
18:15 - all right I'm just gonna delete this one
18:17 - because I don't need any more now again
18:18 - it's really important to make sure that
18:19 - the scores dot text is in the same
18:21 - directory as your python file so you can
18:22 - see I've got two files here this is the
18:24 - one I'm working from and scores is in
18:26 - the same directory it's not inside
18:27 - images is not inside another folder it's
18:29 - right beside the starter file so make
18:31 - sure that's like that hey guys sorry for
18:34 - the interruption here so while I was
18:36 - editing this video I realized I made a
18:37 - really quick mistake so I just wanted to
18:39 - fix that really quickly for you guys so
18:41 - all you need to do to fix this mistake
18:43 - and make your program run properly i's
18:45 - going to scores here and just type 0 and
18:47 - then save it that's all its gonna make
18:50 - it work it's because we're gonna run
18:52 - into an error otherwise I just make sure
18:54 - you go in scores the text file you made
18:56 - type 0 type a number control ctrl s save
19:00 - it and there you go so let's get back
19:02 - with the video and then we're gonna Inc
19:05 - just include a little function that I
19:07 - created here I'm just gonna copy and
19:09 - paste in to save a bit of time as this
19:11 - videos already gone fairly long and you
19:13 - guys can just copy it it's really simple
19:15 - and I'll go through how it works so I'm
19:18 - gonna create another function here it's
19:20 - gonna say update file now what this one
19:22 - does is we use f to open up and save our
19:26 - file as scores text this mode here is
19:29 - our which means we're reading in the
19:31 - file our file now so the content of our
19:34 - file is equal to f dot read lines the
19:37 - last score is just going to be the only
19:39 - line in the file because we're only
19:40 - using that one line so we say file 0
19:42 - that's the first line because this just
19:44 - puts it into a list for us and then we
19:46 - say if last which is going to be the
19:49 - score that we use here is less than the
19:52 - integer of our score
19:54 - then we say F dot close we're gonna
19:57 - close this file because we're actually
19:59 - gonna reopen the same file except we're
20:01 - gonna clear the contents by putting a W
20:03 - here and we're gonna rewrite our score
20:05 - in it like that so that if we get a
20:07 - higher score we're rewriting it if it's
20:09 - a lower score it's gonna stay the same
20:10 - and then if this is true we're gonna
20:12 - return what our current current score
20:14 - was otherwise we're returning the last
20:16 - score that was in the text file which is
20:17 - gonna be higher than what we just got
20:19 - okay so we have this update file just
20:21 - copy this down and then in our end
20:24 - screen here where we have previous score
20:26 - we're just gonna say plus string of
20:29 - update five because not only this update
20:33 - file will update our file it also
20:35 - returns the value of our score that we
20:39 - need to be putting in the text file okay
20:41 - there we are now let's go ahead and run
20:43 - the program and this should be
20:44 - everything that we need again the
20:46 - hitboxes if you feel that the game is
20:48 - too difficult that you're running into
20:49 - objects just go ahead and shrink those
20:51 - down a little bit personally I might
20:53 - make the size of the saw hitbox a little
20:54 - bit smaller so you see those little
20:56 - corners that popping up where the saw
20:57 - actually isn't we don't end up running
21:00 - into those cuz you can see the jump is
21:01 - fairly difficult to do on its own as we
21:04 - continue running our score goes up
21:06 - oh no we fell our score is nine score
21:10 - nine previous score nine there we go
21:11 - because that's the best score so yeah
21:13 - you can see we ran into a glitch here
21:15 - we're just continued to fall that's
21:17 - because I needed to actually fix one
21:19 - thing good job we didn't wrap put the
21:20 - video quite yet once we get in this
21:22 - while loop here we're just gonna
21:23 - underneath here and go runner dog
21:27 - falling equals false and that should
21:32 - hopefully fix things let's make sure so
21:34 - if we jump up and hit the saw again like
21:36 - I said we're always running into bugs
21:38 - here and I'm sure you guys are probably
21:39 - gonna find a lot more if you have any
21:41 - questions about them again just leave
21:42 - them in the comments down below let's
21:44 - jump in the air we run into it and let's
21:48 - see what happens now okay we start you
21:52 - can see there we are and we followed
21:55 - that back down that's just the way that
21:57 - it works there if you want them to again
22:00 - start on the bottom then you guys can
22:02 - figure that out we run into the soil
22:04 - let's see there we go we fall in
22:08 - and as we start back up we fall back
22:10 - down okay very good so that's been it
22:12 - for this video of the fourth and final
22:15 - video and my such roller series if you
