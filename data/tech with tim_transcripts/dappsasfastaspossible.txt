00:00 - now d-apps are really just decentralized
00:02 - apps that's all they are that means they
00:04 - use some type of blockchain technology
00:06 - and we can trust all of the code
00:08 - associated with this application because
00:10 - it's completely open source it never has
00:12 - any downtime and once it's added to the
00:15 - network it cannot be removed modified or
00:18 - changed so just like transactions we
00:20 - know we can trust when they're on the
00:21 - blockchain we know we can trust all of
00:23 - the code that's on the blockchain
00:24 - because we can see it ourselves we know
00:27 - it cannot be changed or modified and we
00:28 - know it's never just going to disappear
00:30 - because the blockchain is always
00:32 - available
