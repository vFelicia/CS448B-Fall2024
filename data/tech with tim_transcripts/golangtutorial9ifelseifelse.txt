00:02 - [Music]
00:06 - hello everybody and welcome back so in
00:09 - this video we're finally starting to get
00:10 - into some of the more interesting things
00:11 - I know other some of these other videos
00:13 - have been kind of boring just because
00:14 - they're teaching you the basics and the
00:16 - fundamentals but now we're into
00:18 - if-statements which in my opinion is the
00:19 - first life pretty interesting thing in
00:21 - programming that you can do at least to
00:23 - make some somewhat interesting programs
00:26 - like you can do some cool things with
00:27 - them so I'm gonna be teaching you
00:28 - if-else and Elif in this video these are
00:31 - known as conditional statements so
00:33 - essentially the way that you read it is
00:35 - like if this happened to do that
00:37 - otherwise do this if this happens do
00:41 - that if this doesn't happen check if
00:42 - this happens do that so it's a way to
00:44 - check you know using these conditions
00:46 - that we've just talked about previously
00:48 - if something happened and then executes
00:50 - a block of code after that so I'm gonna
00:52 - show you the basic syntax of an if
00:54 - statement and then we'll just get into
00:55 - an example so it looks like this if I'm
00:59 - gonna be typing this like I work in so
01:01 - many programming languages so I might
01:02 - make a few mistakes here but the idea is
01:04 - if we have if like that then we put some
01:07 - conditions so condition goes here and
01:09 - then whatever's inside of these squiggly
01:11 - brackets will happen only if this
01:13 - condition is true if this condition is
01:16 - false we will simply skip over this if
01:18 - statement so we'll go over to line 9
01:19 - pass by it and then continue doing
01:22 - whatever else happens so I'll show you
01:24 - some examples so like fmt duh println
01:26 - will just print like before if so this
01:30 - will always happen before if will print
01:33 - in here after it and then in the middle
01:37 - will print if like inside if just so you
01:41 - guys can see all these things okay so
01:42 - the condition here is simply any of
01:45 - those boolean expressions or statements
01:47 - that I showed you in the previous videos
01:48 - so anything here that evaluates to true
01:50 - or false you can put so what I can do
01:53 - and I'll just make a variable here say
01:55 - Val colon equals like let's just say Tim
01:57 - actually let's make it name like that so
02:00 - we'll say name colon equals Tim and then
02:02 - here always say if name is equal to Tim
02:07 - then inside it right so this is the
02:10 - block that I've set up this is saying if
02:11 - this expression is true
02:13 - then do whatever is inside of these set
02:15 - of curly braces so in fact I could do
02:17 - something else in here too like I could
02:19 - print another line I could put another
02:20 - if statement if I wanted to we'll get
02:23 - into nested like stuff later on but
02:26 - that's the idea so let's run this and
02:28 - see how this looks
02:29 - go run tutorial dot we get in here now
02:34 - we get before if inside if after if now
02:37 - that's because this was true right name
02:39 - does equal Tim but what if I now go to
02:41 - name does not equal Tim so I change this
02:43 - this obviously now is gonna be false so
02:45 - we know that's false so we'll we print
02:48 - what's inside the if statement well
02:49 - based on my definition we shouldn't and
02:51 - let's have a look at this code and see
02:52 - if it does so no it does not we get
02:55 - before if and then after if so notice
02:57 - that what happened was we did this line
02:58 - we checked if this was true since it
03:01 - wasn't we skipped over line ten we just
03:03 - passed by it and then we continued on
03:04 - with the rest of the program and we
03:06 - printed after if now you'll notice that
03:08 - I'm doing some indented stuff here like
03:09 - I'm indenting it forward the standard
03:12 - kind of convention when you write these
03:13 - if statements is to anything that's
03:15 - happening inside the if to indent it in
03:17 - by one tab space or tab spaces that word
03:20 - I don't know one tab like that you don't
03:22 - have to you though so long as it's
03:24 - inside of these squiggly brackets it's
03:26 - totally fine and that's the idea behind
03:28 - that and also notice like inside this
03:29 - function we tabbed everything inside one
03:32 - that's just so that it's easier to read
03:34 - and you can kind of tell what's inside
03:35 - of what right okay so that's the if
03:38 - statement and that's pretty much how
03:39 - that works right you have a value you
03:41 - check some kind of expression in here I
03:43 - mean we could do this if we wanted to we
03:44 - could say name does not equal Tim or
03:46 - name equal stem now obviously this is
03:49 - always gonna be true but that's totally
03:51 - valid and if I go ahead and run this
03:53 - then we'll see that that if statement
03:55 - does run and we get before if inside if
03:58 - after if so that's the basics of it the
04:00 - if now there is another thing called the
04:02 - else and the else is pretty useful
04:04 - because sometimes what you want to say
04:06 - is if this condition is true do this
04:08 - otherwise do this right so I'm gonna
04:12 - make a better example now and I'm gonna
04:14 - put actually age so let's say age colon
04:17 - equals seventeen now the example I want
04:19 - to use is if you are older than eighteen
04:21 - you can ride the rollercoaster otherwise
04:23 - you can't ride it right that's something
04:25 - example just rented one that we'll use
04:26 - so the condition I should put here if I
04:29 - want to check if they're older than 18
04:31 - should be age greater than or equal to
04:34 - 18 so I'm gonna say if they're 18 or
04:36 - older than 18 then what we'll print is
04:38 - you can ride okay like that but
04:42 - otherwise if they can't ride what I want
04:44 - to do is print you can't ride so most of
04:47 - you without knowing what an else
04:48 - statement is which I'm going to show you
04:49 - here would just do this you cannot ride
04:52 - right so you'd say okay so if they can
04:54 - ride will print this otherwise we'll
04:56 - print you cannot ride but can you think
04:58 - about what the issue is gonna be if I do
04:59 - this well what's gonna happen is that
05:02 - even if we can ride will print you can
05:04 - ride and then after the if statement
05:06 - will still print you cannot ride so in
05:09 - the situation where you are older than
05:10 - 18 it'll tell you can ride and then
05:12 - immediately it will tell you you can't
05:13 - we don't want that to happen so what
05:15 - we're gonna introduce and in fact let me
05:17 - just prove to you that's true so let's
05:18 - go go run tutorial don't go I prints you
05:22 - cannot ride just because we were
05:23 - seventeen but if we put 19 here and we
05:27 - run this then it says you can ride you
05:30 - cannot ride so the way we fixed this is
05:33 - by putting an else statement so an else
05:35 - is simply what happens if the condition
05:38 - above it is not true so if this is false
05:42 - do this that's all that means
05:45 - so no matter what one of these two
05:47 - statements every single time will be
05:48 - printed because if this isn't true and
05:51 - we don't run what's inside of that we
05:53 - will run what's inside of the else and
05:54 - the syntax of the else is you write else
05:57 - you don't need any condition here
05:59 - because it's just gonna happen no matter
06:00 - what so long as you know this isn't true
06:03 - and then you put these little braces and
06:05 - then you write whatever inside of the
06:06 - else that you want to run and actually
06:08 - in this case let's say you cannot ride
06:10 - say wait and I'm gonna do percent D
06:15 - years and then what I'm gonna do is
06:17 - actually say 18 - age so I'll tell them
06:20 - how many years they need to wait until
06:21 - they can ride so 18 - age okay so let's
06:24 - do that
06:26 - and let's put this down to seventeen now
06:28 - and let's run this now what is the issue
06:29 - that this is telling me okay what is the
06:32 - squiggly line has possible formatting
06:35 - directive set D I think that's fine
06:38 - okay so go run tutorial dot go wait two
06:42 - percent d ah sorry this is supposed to
06:46 - be print f not println I was like what
06:48 - the heck is happening there okay let me
06:49 - just run this one more time and have a
06:51 - look at this down here and we get you
06:55 - cannot ride wait one years right so wait
06:57 - one year before you can ride the roller
06:59 - coaster so that's how this works with
07:01 - the if else if this is not true do that
07:03 - if this is true don't do that so let's
07:05 - make this 19 and let's just show you
07:07 - what happens if we now are old enough
07:09 - go run tutorial go and we get you can
07:13 - ride so that's the the basics there okay
07:16 - now the last thing to show is something
07:17 - called else if so else if it kind of
07:20 - happens like consider the case where
07:22 - maybe if they're older than 18 they can
07:24 - ride if they're 18 they can ride with a
07:27 - parent or something I don't know like if
07:29 - they're under 18 they can ride with a
07:30 - parent but if they're younger than 14
07:33 - they can't ride it also we have like
07:35 - three cases right if they're between 14
07:37 - and 18 they can ride but they need a
07:38 - parent if they're older 18 then they can
07:41 - ride by themselves and if they're
07:43 - younger than 14 then they just can't
07:44 - ride how do we accommodate that case
07:47 - well I mean we could do like three if
07:50 - statements right like I could do this
07:52 - and I could say if age is greater than
07:53 - or equal to 18 print you can ride let's
07:56 - say alone and then here I could do if
07:59 - age is I'm greater than or equal to 14
08:03 - and age is less than or equal to 18 so
08:08 - this way actually we'd have to say less
08:10 - than in that case so if they're between
08:11 - 14 and 18 but they're not 18 because if
08:13 - they were 18 they'd be able to ride then
08:15 - we'll print you can ride with a parent
08:19 - and then otherwise so in the situation
08:21 - where they're less than 14 so if age is
08:23 - less than 14 then print you cannot ride
08:29 - so this will work this is fine but the
08:31 - issue with this is I've kind of repeated
08:33 - a lot of logic like I've checked if
08:34 - they're older than 14 um like twice I've
08:37 - checked if they're younger than 18 twice
08:39 - there's actually a way easy way to write
08:41 - this and I'm gonna leave this down below
08:43 - just so we can compare to it after but
08:46 - there's a way that we can use something
08:47 - called else if so what I can do is say
08:48 - something like this
08:49 - if age is greater than or equal to 18
08:52 - then what we can say is f of T dot print
08:56 - line you you can ride alone if I could
09:04 - type okay so you can ride alone and then
09:06 - otherwise so if they can't write alone
09:08 - what I can do is use an else--if now
09:10 - what else if does is essentially say if
09:12 - this isn't true check this so if this
09:16 - doesn't happen then check if this is
09:18 - true that's how this works so I'll say
09:21 - else if and I actually don't need the
09:23 - brackets there but I'll say else if age
09:25 - is greater than or equal to 14 then fmt
09:29 - dot print line and we'll just say you
09:32 - can ride actually we'll just copy all
09:34 - this okay so you can ride with a parent
09:38 - like that okay so now we have the if we
09:42 - have an else if and I mean we could do
09:44 - another else if but what we can actually
09:45 - do is add an else here and what the else
09:47 - will says in any other situation so if
09:50 - they're not older than 18 and if they're
09:52 - not older than 14 then what we can do is
09:54 - we can tell them I'll just copy this fmt
09:56 - down here that they cannot write so this
09:59 - is the equivalent to here and you can
10:01 - notice this a little bit neater it makes
10:03 - a little bit more sense and yeah that's
10:06 - kind of the idea behind this if-else
10:07 - if-else
10:08 - so again else if will work with any
10:11 - condition here and it will only check
10:13 - this if this isn't true then the else
10:16 - what this says is well if everything
10:18 - above me was not true then go ahead and
10:21 - execute the else now what's interesting
10:24 - is that we can put more than one else if
10:26 - if we want so I can do let me top that
10:29 - down here another else if and I could
10:31 - check say like else if age greater than
10:34 - or equal to ten and then we can add the
10:36 - else at the end but we don't even need
10:38 - the else if we don't want it so you just
10:39 - notice that all these things are
10:40 - optional we don't need it else we can
10:43 - have an else if we want we don't need
10:45 - else ifs we can have as many of them
10:46 - though if we do want them the only thing
10:49 - that you need to remember is that else
10:50 - cannot go in between else ifs because
10:54 - this is like the default case like if
10:56 - all else fails it's a good way a good
10:58 - punny way to put it almost if all of
11:00 - this fails then do
11:02 - else so I hope that's kind of making
11:04 - sense but I want to break down what I've
11:06 - written here a little bit more just to
11:07 - really clear this up so notice that here
11:09 - I had to check if age was greater than
11:11 - equal to 14 and less than 18 the reason
11:15 - for that is if they're 18 like let's say
11:17 - they're 18 right then we will print that
11:20 - you can ride alone now if I omitted this
11:22 - why I got rid of that and then it would
11:25 - also print you can ride with a parent
11:27 - which I mean is technically true but we
11:29 - don't want to show that right we only
11:31 - want to show them one of these print
11:32 - statements so because of that I had to
11:34 - add this extra condition that said let's
11:36 - make sure they're in that range so we
11:38 - don't accidentally print two statements
11:40 - and then same thing down here right I
11:42 - had to save ages less than 14 because if
11:45 - I just put on like an else statement for
11:47 - example then actually wouldn't else
11:50 - statement work I guess an else they
11:51 - wouldn't work if I did that here but
11:52 - anyways that's the idea that like this
11:55 - middle condition I had to check
11:56 - something extra whereas up here I don't
11:58 - have to check that the reason I don't
12:00 - have to check that is because if they're
12:02 - greater than 18 we'll print you can ride
12:03 - alone and then just skip down to line 15
12:06 - after the else statement right so that's
12:08 - why this is oftentimes much better to
12:10 - use than this kind of structure with
12:13 - just three independent if statements
12:15 - because you obviously can write multiple
12:16 - if statements you can put ifs inside of
12:18 - else's else inside of ifs it starts
12:21 - getting pretty complex and interesting
12:22 - the further we go but let's test this
12:24 - and make sure that I'm not lying to you
12:25 - guys so go run tutorial dot go and we
12:29 - get you can ride alone when they're 19
12:31 - so let's put them at 16 let's make sure
12:34 - that it works for that case and it says
12:36 - now you can ride with the parent okay
12:38 - and let's put them at 13 and see what we
12:41 - get and it says you cannot ride so
12:45 - that's the basics behind the if-else
12:47 - if-else quick recap the basic almost
12:51 - formula for writing this is let's get
12:54 - rid of that for a second is when you
12:56 - want to check if something happens and
12:58 - then do that you write if you write the
13:00 - condition you want to check this has to
13:01 - evaluate to true or false you put your
13:03 - brackets and then whatever you put
13:05 - inside of here and you can put multiple
13:06 - things as many things as you want that
13:08 - will happen if this condition is true
13:10 - then what you can do is you can add else
13:13 - ifs and else and those are optional you
13:15 - don't
13:16 - but you're allowed to add them so we can
13:18 - go back and we can add the else if the
13:20 - way the else/if works is if this doesn't
13:23 - happen then check this and if that's
13:26 - true do this but if this happens here
13:29 - this will not even be checked we won't
13:30 - even bother doing that comparison right
13:32 - now if we go back we add the else
13:35 - now the else is optional we don't need
13:37 - that and this says if all else fails
13:39 - everything above me go ahead and do this
13:41 - and we can have multiple else's of
13:43 - course if we want those so that has been
13:45 - this video and if else if and else I
13:47 - hope you guys enjoyed it if you did make
13:48 - sure they like subscribe and I will see
13:50 - you in the next goal Aang tutorial
