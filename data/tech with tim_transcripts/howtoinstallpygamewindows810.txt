00:00 - hey guys welcome back to another YouTube
00:02 - video today's video I'm gonna be showing
00:04 - you how to install PI game for Python on
00:07 - Windows so this is Windows 10 right now
00:09 - this will work in Windows 8 but if
00:11 - you're using an earlier version of
00:12 - Windows so Windows 7 or Windows XP
00:14 - you're gonna have to find a different
00:15 - tutorial for this because some of the
00:17 - things I do aren't going to work in that
00:18 - version ok so let's get started right
00:20 - away
00:21 - the first thing you need to do if we
00:23 - haven't done so already is download
00:25 - Python so I assume most of you already
00:27 - have Python downloaded but if you don't
00:29 - just go ahead and head over to the
00:30 - Python website slash downloads and then
00:33 - download Python 3 point 6 point 3 or
00:35 - whatever the latest version is when
00:37 - you're doing this tutorial so I'm just
00:38 - going to go ahead and click on this and
00:39 - we'll go through it here so now that
00:42 - this is loaded up if you haven't already
00:44 - installed Python you're just going to
00:45 - want to make sure you click on this
00:47 - check button here it says add pipes on
00:49 - 3.62 path now this is really important
00:52 - and this is gonna save you a lot of time
00:54 - later on if you do this if you add to
00:56 - the path ok otherwise if when you
00:58 - installed it you didn't add to the path
01:00 - I'm gonna show you guys how you can edit
01:01 - the path and you can add it in so you're
01:03 - gonna be able to do what I show you next
01:05 - okay so I actually already have this
01:07 - installed so I'm not gonna install it
01:09 - here but if you don't then just go ahead
01:10 - and click install now it's very simple
01:12 - you can go through the process okay so
01:15 - now that we've done that I'm gonna show
01:17 - you how we can install pieing so the
01:19 - first thing we're gonna want to do is
01:21 - open up our command prompt so this is
01:23 - our first test just to see if this works
01:25 - and if this doesn't work then I'll show
01:27 - you the next step later so we're just
01:28 - gonna start by typing pip soapy IP now
01:32 - you should see something like this come
01:33 - up if you don't don't worry just wait a
01:36 - little bit later I'm gonna show you how
01:38 - we can get this to work so if this
01:40 - didn't work for you you might get some
01:41 - an error that says pip is not a
01:43 - recognized command on Windows or
01:45 - something like that and I'll show you
01:47 - how we can how we can fix that so now if
01:49 - this worked for you well you get all you
01:51 - have to do now to install a PI game is
01:53 - pip install PI game just like this and
01:58 - pip is pretty much package installer for
01:59 - Python and it's built into Python if you
02:02 - added that to the path so if you do that
02:04 - pip install PI game then it should start
02:07 - collecting everything and installing it
02:09 - so here we go it says it installed PI
02:11 - game correctly
02:12 - so now I'm just gonna uninstall just so
02:16 - I can show everyone else how to do it
02:18 - properly okay so if that didn't work for
02:22 - you don't worry if it did work for you
02:24 - can just click off the video now and it
02:27 - should everything should be working in
02:28 - PI game alright so now let's say that
02:31 - didn't work that pretty much just means
02:33 - that the path for Python is actually not
02:36 - in your environmental variables so what
02:39 - we need to do is we need to get to those
02:40 - environmental variables so a way to do
02:42 - that is to just simply go to control
02:44 - panel so we can just search that in the
02:45 - bottom here control panel load that up
02:48 - here and we're gonna click on system and
02:51 - security we're gonna click on system
02:53 - again and then advanced system settings
02:57 - on the left side here and now once that
02:59 - comes up you should be on the Advanced
03:01 - tab and you're gonna click on
03:02 - environmental variables right here all
03:06 - right so now we're gonna scroll down
03:08 - until you see something that says path
03:10 - so here you can see if I drag my window
03:13 - boat mine's pretty long that's just
03:14 - because I have three different paths now
03:17 - yours is probably only gonna have one
03:19 - thing in it it's probably just gonna
03:21 - have this Windows apps path it's not
03:24 - gonna have the python path if that other
03:26 - thing didn't work for you so now we want
03:29 - to change this because we want to add
03:30 - something to this path so you're gonna
03:32 - click on edit and it's gonna come up and
03:34 - it's going to show you these three
03:35 - different paths right here now you may
03:38 - have one you may not have any so let's
03:40 - say you don't have any of them here then
03:42 - what you need to do is you need to make
03:43 - a new path by just clicking on new and
03:45 - simply calling it path like that and
03:48 - then you can type in the directory which
03:52 - I will show you in this next step okay
03:54 - so say we have this path already we
03:56 - click Edit and now you have one thing in
03:59 - here what we need to do is we need to
04:01 - add the location of where your Python is
04:03 - saved on your computer
04:04 - so you should know where it's saved this
04:06 - is the default location where I have it
04:08 - so in opt out of local programs Python
04:10 - and then Python 36 that's where my
04:14 - python is saved if you don't know where
04:16 - yours is you can just go to Windows
04:18 - Explorer here and just search throughout
04:21 - your whole C Drive for it it might take
04:23 - a second depending on how fast your
04:25 - drive is
04:25 - you search Python like that and just
04:28 - wait for it to load up it is gonna take
04:30 - a minute but it will show you where the
04:32 - Python directory is so you can type that
04:34 - into the path like that all right
04:36 - so now that we know where our Python
04:38 - directory is all we have to do is click
04:40 - new and then you can simply type it in
04:43 - so for example I already have mine here
04:45 - but you do see drive slash users slash
04:48 - and then so on filling in your Python
04:52 - path so that it should end like this
04:54 - with Python and then python 36 so I'm
04:57 - just gonna delete that one cuz I don't
04:58 - need that alright so once you've done
05:01 - that now you're gonna type the exact
05:03 - same path again so you're gonna click
05:04 - new and you're gonna do the exact same
05:06 - path you just typed in which would be
05:08 - this one here except you're gonna do
05:10 - slash scripts and then another slash at
05:13 - the end so this is just so that we can
05:14 - use the Python package installer and you
05:17 - have access to Python so you have two
05:18 - different paths which are gonna be in
05:20 - your command prompt
05:21 - okay so again I'll just go over that
05:23 - quickly because we weren't kind of fast
05:24 - all you need to do is find the location
05:26 - of your Python so the directory on your
05:28 - C Drive D Drive wherever it is type that
05:31 - in so you just click new like that and
05:33 - type it here and then you're gonna do
05:35 - the exact same path except you're just
05:36 - gonna add scripts to the end and you're
05:38 - gonna hit new again when you do that so
05:39 - you have two separate paths and they
05:41 - should look something like the two I
05:42 - have up here right now once you've done
05:44 - that you're gonna click OK and ok again
05:47 - at the bottom and now we're gonna go
05:49 - back to our command prompt to make sure
05:50 - that this all works so now you go to
05:52 - command prompt and we'll do the exact
05:54 - same steps I showed before you just type
05:56 - pip install pygame like so it should
06:01 - grab it and install it and it doesn't
06:03 - take very long just like that now if you
06:05 - want to verify that your thing is
06:08 - actually working your PI game is working
06:09 - you can go ahead and open up IDL e which
06:12 - is Python which you just installed wait
06:15 - for that to load up so I got mine over
06:17 - here and then all you have to do is just
06:19 - type import PI game like so and if you
06:23 - don't get an error message that means
06:25 - everything's working and you
06:26 - successfully installed PI game alright
06:29 - so that has been this video for today I
06:31 - know a lot of people have been having
06:32 - trouble installing PI game they think
06:35 - they have to go to the website to
06:36 - download the wheel file
06:38 - you may have to do that but if you
06:39 - followed everything I did in this
06:40 - tutorial it should work for you and if
06:42 - you're having trouble adding the things
06:44 - to the path you can always just
06:45 - reinstall Python and click Add to path
06:48 - and it'll do it automatically for you so
06:50 - you don't have to go through that whole
06:51 - process alright so if you liked the
06:53 - video and it helped you out please leave
