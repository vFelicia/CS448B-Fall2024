00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:02 - YouTube video so in today's video I'm
00:04 - kind of showing you a cool facial
00:06 - detection thing that I wrote in Python
00:08 - and I'm just testing it here as you guys
00:10 - can see on the 2016 presidential debate
00:13 - I believe that's the year that this was
00:15 - taking place on and pretty much the goal
00:17 - of this software is to detect eyes mouth
00:19 - and face so you can see here that it's
00:22 - working on wherever these like announcer
00:24 - people are alright and it can detect
00:27 - things actually pretty well so this is
00:29 - like a really straightforward like took
00:31 - me like half an hour to write script it
00:33 - just uses Python and cv2 and pretty much
00:36 - the goal of it is to first detect the
00:37 - face once it detects the face and then
00:39 - looks for two eyes and a mouth
00:41 - within that face now you can see it's
00:44 - obviously not perfect this didn't take
00:46 - me very long to make and I'm working on
00:47 - kind of tweaking it and fine-tuning it
00:49 - but I thought it was something that's
00:50 - pretty cool
00:51 - and I wanted to show it to you guys and
00:52 - get you excited about some of the future
00:54 - videos that I'm going to be making so in
00:57 - some of the future videos that I'm going
00:58 - to be posting I'm gonna be showing you
00:59 - guys how to use cv2 which is kind of
01:01 - meant for like images and like
01:02 - recognition and stuff and then we're
01:04 - gonna be combining that with like AI and
01:06 - some machine learning stuff so if you
01:08 - guys are excited about that make sure
01:09 - you let me know in the comments down
01:10 - below now for warning I am going away
01:13 - for Christmas so that means I'm gonna be
01:15 - away from my PC and any recording
01:18 - materials that I have so I have a few
01:20 - videos scheduled to upload but I'm not
01:22 - gonna be getting into any of the machine
01:23 - learning or AI to toriel's really until
01:26 - we hit the new year so hopefully you
01:27 - guys are okay waiting for that anyways
01:29 - that's kind of all I had for you guys I
01:30 - just want to show you the cool little
01:32 - thing that I made in Python hopefully
01:34 - you guys find this as interesting as I
01:35 - do so anyways that's all I got for you
01:37 - guys feel free to continue watching the
01:39 - rest of the video and I will see you in
01:41 - the next one
