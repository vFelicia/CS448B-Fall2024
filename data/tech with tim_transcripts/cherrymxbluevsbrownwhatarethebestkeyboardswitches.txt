00:00 - so if you're a programmer like me or
00:01 - just someone who spends a lot of time in
00:03 - front of the computer then I'm going to
00:04 - assume that your keyboard is one of the
00:06 - most used items on your desk and for
00:08 - that reason I think that you should have
00:10 - a good one something I tell everyone
00:12 - right away is when you're building a new
00:13 - computer when you're setting up make
00:15 - sure you have a nice keyboard and that's
00:17 - because this will make a world of a
00:18 - difference when it comes to efficiency
00:20 - and even just how much pleasure you're
00:21 - gonna get when you sit down and start
00:23 - typing I know personally when I bought
00:25 - my new keyboards that were very nice I
00:27 - was much more inclined to want to sit at
00:28 - my computer and do work just because the
00:30 - experience was so much better so in this
00:33 - video I'm gonna talk to you about my two
00:34 - favorite types of mechanical keyboards
00:36 - and why would recommend them to you
00:38 - these keyboards have different key
00:40 - switches in them and I'm gonna go
00:41 - through and talk to you about the
00:42 - details and specs of those key switches
00:44 - and why they're great for typing and
00:46 - programming so with that being said
00:48 - let's go ahead and get into the video
00:49 - and talk about my two favorite types of
00:51 - mechanical keyboards so we'll start by
01:00 - saying that there are many different
01:01 - keyboards in so many different types of
01:03 - key switches the two that I'm covering
01:05 - here are typically the most popular
01:07 - these are what people will highly
01:09 - recommend for typing and accuracy and
01:11 - that's why I wanted to compare them
01:12 - because these are just the most popular
01:14 - switches and personally my favorite so
01:16 - the first keyboard that I actually have
01:18 - to show you guys is this one now this is
01:20 - the desk keyboard for professional with
01:23 - cherry MX blue switches now these are
01:25 - the clicky switches I'll be showing you
01:27 - the audio and tactile feedback of these
01:29 - later on but the next keyboard that I
01:31 - have is actually another - keyboard this
01:33 - is the 4 Q model it has the Cherry MX
01:36 - brown switches inside of them now -
01:38 - keyboard was actually nice enough to
01:39 - send me over this blue model here that
01:41 - I'm gonna be giving away at the end of
01:43 - the video for the purpose of reviewing
01:44 - it and doing a comparison between the
01:46 - brown keyboard which I actually bought
01:48 - myself a while ago so - keyboard has
01:50 - personally been one of my favorite
01:52 - keyboard brands the link to both these
01:53 - products will be in the description down
01:55 - below and again thank you to them for
01:56 - sending over this keyboard and giving it
01:58 - away to one of you and I will talk about
02:00 - how that giveaway is going to work at
02:01 - the end of the video so before I go into
02:03 - the details of both of these keyboards
02:05 - I'm gonna give you a very basic
02:06 - definition of the way that a standard
02:08 - keyboard works versus a mechanical
02:11 - keep in mind this is a generalization
02:13 - and just meant to give you a basic idea
02:14 - so you understand the advantages of a
02:16 - mechanical keyboard so with a
02:18 - traditional keyboard the system that is
02:20 - typically used is you have a layer of
02:22 - key switches you have actually three
02:24 - layers of plastic membrane below that
02:27 - and to signal a key press you must
02:29 - connect the top layer of membrane with
02:31 - the bottom layer of membrane where the
02:33 - middle layer of membrane is simply sat
02:35 - there to separate the two layers so that
02:37 - they aren't already touching so what
02:39 - actually happens when you press a key is
02:41 - you will press that key and there'll be
02:43 - a little hole in the middle layer of
02:44 - membrane that allows something to go
02:47 - down through that hole and connect the
02:48 - top layer and the bottom layer again
02:50 - this is a generalization but at that
02:53 - point what will happen is an electrical
02:54 - circuit will be complete and a signal
02:56 - will be sent to the computer that says
02:58 - hey you pressed this key now the issue
03:00 - with this system is there is actually a
03:02 - limitation to the amount of key presses
03:04 - you can do per second and that is I
03:06 - believe six on in those types of systems
03:08 - so you actually cannot send more than
03:11 - six key presses per second to your
03:13 - computer which you could imagine might
03:15 - be an issue if you're gaming if you're
03:16 - typing if you're doing anything very
03:18 - quickly for most people it's not but if
03:20 - you get to that point you will realize
03:22 - that the keyboard is actually missing
03:23 - your keyboard hits now contrasting that
03:25 - with a mechanical keyboard the way that
03:27 - a mechanical keyboard works one of the
03:28 - ones that we have here is it actually
03:30 - contains independent key switches for
03:33 - every single key so in theory you could
03:35 - use different key switches on your
03:36 - keyboard for different keys so different
03:39 - brown blue whatever you want and if a
03:41 - key switch breaks you can simply replace
03:42 - that switch now the great thing with
03:44 - this too is that there's something
03:46 - called n key roll over on that kind of
03:48 - gets implemented with that system and
03:50 - what that means is there's no longer any
03:51 - limitation to how many keys you can
03:53 - press per second because there's an
03:55 - independent switch for each key and
03:57 - they're all independently sending that
03:58 - signal through the wire obviously there
04:01 - is something called n key rollover
04:02 - that's a feature of most mechanical
04:04 - keyboards so you have that which is
04:06 - great which means there's no limitation
04:07 - you're not gonna miss any key switches
04:09 - and you also get something called
04:10 - tactile and audio feedback so tactile
04:13 - feedback is the idea that when you press
04:15 - the key you actually know that you
04:16 - pressed it because you can feel it with
04:19 - your finger and you'll notice on a
04:20 - mechanical key switch that when you
04:22 - press it down you can feel a point
04:24 - somewhere but
04:24 - the bottom L point and the top known as
04:27 - the actuation point and at that point
04:29 - you have officially pressed the key even
04:31 - if it hasn't bottomed doubt and hit the
04:33 - bottom of the keyboard this is why a lot
04:35 - of people love mechanical keyboards
04:36 - because the actuation point gives you
04:39 - that feedback that yes I press this key
04:40 - so it's a lot easier to actually type
04:42 - when you're looking at the screen in
04:44 - front of you whereas on another keyboard
04:46 - you might actually miss pressing keys
04:47 - and whatever stuff like that right it's
04:49 - just easier tactile feedback feels a lot
04:52 - nicer when you're typing so those are
04:54 - the major differences now I'm going to
04:55 - talk about the two key switches here
04:57 - that I'm comparing which again is the
04:58 - Blues key switch and the brown key
05:00 - switch and I'll give you an audio
05:02 - example and kind of talk through the
05:03 - actuation point and the details of that
05:05 - okay so now we're gonna go into the
05:07 - details and the kind of specifics and
05:09 - statistics of both of these keyboards
05:11 - and specifically the key switches so
05:14 - let's start with a cherry MX blue switch
05:16 - so on the desk keyboard for professional
05:18 - it has the Cherry MX blue and it even
05:21 - says on here clicky typing experience
05:23 - now that is what the Blues are really
05:25 - known for is their clicky and tactile
05:28 - feedback so clicky I'll play the sound
05:30 - so you guys can hear it
06:00 - so you hear a very loud click whenever
06:03 - you press those keys it's one of the
06:04 - loudest keyboards by far that I've ever
06:06 - used but what that also means is that
06:09 - it's way easier to determine when you've
06:11 - hit a key and get that tactile feedback
06:13 - so the stats for this key switch in
06:15 - terms of actuation point and pressure is
06:17 - the actuation point is at two point two
06:19 - millimeters of travel the bottom out
06:22 - point is at four millimeters and you'll
06:23 - reach that actuation point with 50 grams
06:26 - of pressure so if you put 50 grams of
06:28 - pressure down on that key then you'll
06:30 - hit the actuation point and you will
06:31 - press the key death now let's compare
06:34 - that to the brown keyboard so the brown
06:36 - keyboard is a little bit different than
06:37 - this blue keyboard they're very similar
06:39 - but the main difference of this this
06:40 - does not have that clicky experience so
06:43 - I'll play the sounds so you guys can
06:45 - hear them this keyboard has a much
07:15 - quieter sound so it's still there you
07:17 - can still definitely hear it but it's
07:19 - more of a bump and a thud than it is a
07:21 - click like this blue keyboard now in
07:23 - terms of the actuation point in travel
07:25 - it's very similar to the blue this has a
07:28 - actuation point at two millimeters and
07:30 - that requires 45 grams of pressure to
07:33 - reach and then it bottoms out at four
07:35 - millimeters as well and it's also rated
07:36 - at 50 million key presses as its
07:38 - lifespan so they're very similar but the
07:41 - massive difference between the two is
07:42 - that it's a little bit easier to hit
07:43 - this Brown keyboard here to hit the
07:46 - switches and press them down then is the
07:48 - blue and that the blue keyboard that I
07:50 - have here is a much louder so I'll do
07:52 - the audio comparison with you guys so
07:54 - that you can hear the difference and
07:55 - then we'll talk more
08:20 - so as you would have noticed both of
08:22 - them definitely have a very loud sound
08:24 - to them you can definitely hear them
08:26 - quite clearly but the blue is definitely
08:28 - much louder and in my opinion I would
08:30 - say a little bit more annoying it has
08:31 - that more clicky sound although some
08:33 - people really do like that sound now
08:35 - personally for me I am more of a fan of
08:38 - this Brown keyboard now I like the brown
08:40 - because I don't like to have to press
08:41 - down that hard and on the blue I find
08:44 - that I have to hit the key much harder
08:46 - to actually trigger which is weird
08:48 - because the pressure is very similar but
08:50 - I guess I'm just so used to the brown
08:51 - that when I use this blue I'm noticing
08:53 - that I'm hitting the key a little bit
08:56 - harder after push it down harder and
08:57 - that's kind of slowing me down the one
08:59 - thing I will say though is that when I
09:01 - go from a brown to a blue I noticed that
09:04 - I'm more accurate on the blue keyboard
09:05 - the reason for that I believe is because
09:07 - of the fact that I have to press the key
09:09 - down harder that means that I have to be
09:11 - a lot more I'm kind of distinct and
09:13 - decisive when I'm hitting that key and I
09:14 - don't often notice myself hitting the
09:16 - side of a key and triggering the keys
09:18 - around it which is a big issue for
09:20 - myself personally what I'm typing I'll
09:22 - make those typos just by accidentally
09:24 - hitting kind of in between the key with
09:26 - this one since the pressure is greater
09:27 - it's a lot harder to make that mistake
09:29 - but I definitely do go a little bit
09:31 - slower than on the brown keyboard so
09:33 - that's kind of the two big differences
09:35 - between these keyboards the brown is a
09:37 - little bit lighter most people like the
09:39 - brown more for typing also just because
09:41 - of the sound on it it's a lot quieter
09:43 - but a lot of people like this blue
09:45 - especially if you're someone who makes a
09:46 - quite a few typos this is gonna force
09:48 - you to really be distinct when you press
09:51 - those keys down so in summary we talked
09:53 - about the blue switches and the brown
09:55 - switches now these switches are very
09:57 - similar but they do have a few
09:59 - differences which I'll just summarize
10:00 - here so the blue is a little bit heavier
10:02 - to press down it's all bit louder it has
10:04 - that clicky sound to it whereas the
10:06 - Browns are a little bit lighter not by
10:08 - much a little bit lighter there
10:09 - nearly as loud and they have more of a
10:11 - thump or kind of a dud to the press now
10:14 - these are both great options I'm
10:15 - confident that you're not going to be
10:16 - disappointed if you get either of these
10:18 - keyboards or any keyboard that has these
10:20 - switches inside of them
