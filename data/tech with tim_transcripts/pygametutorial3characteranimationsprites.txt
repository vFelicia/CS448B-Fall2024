00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:02 - YouTube video so this is gonna be the
00:04 - third video in my PI game programming
00:07 - series and in this video I'm gonna be
00:09 - going over character animation so on my
00:11 - last video someone did comment saying
00:13 - that they wanted to see some character
00:15 - animation and obviously I was gonna
00:17 - incorporate that into the tutorials but
00:19 - I am bringing it in a little bit earlier
00:21 - than we usually would so obviously if
00:24 - you remember from the last tutorial so
00:25 - I'll pull up what we had so far we had a
00:28 - little red square and he was able to
00:30 - move around the screen but when he got
00:31 - to the edges he'd be stopped and if you
00:34 - click space he'd do a little jump like
00:36 - that now this is really basic doesn't
00:39 - really look very good it just kind of
00:41 - cool because you can move him around
00:43 - but obviously we want to make something
00:44 - that looks better and uses a real
00:46 - character and real sprites now full
00:49 - disclosure I did not make any of these
00:51 - sprites I simply just went on Google
00:53 - Images and download a sprite sheet and
00:54 - I'll show you what they look like here
00:56 - if you guys would like to use other
00:58 - sprites and you don't want to use this
00:59 - character that's completely fine you can
01:02 - find your own sprites just make sure
01:03 - that they are the same size so these are
01:05 - 64 by 64 and that you have nine images
01:08 - for each of them I'm sure you can
01:10 - probably figure out how to make it work
01:12 - with different images or different size
01:14 - images but this tutorial is only going
01:16 - to work with these specific sprites I
01:18 - hope that makes sense so pretty much all
01:20 - these images that you're seeing right
01:21 - here I'm gonna leave a link to download
01:23 - them down below in the description
01:25 - you just have to click on that link and
01:27 - you can go to my github where you'll be
01:29 - able to download first of all this file
01:31 - if you want that that we're gonna be
01:33 - working on today the background image
01:35 - and then all these sprites okay so let's
01:38 - get on with the video so also another
01:39 - important thing is before we start we
01:42 - actually need to make a new folder so
01:43 - before if your game was on your desktop
01:46 - you need to move it into a folder I just
01:48 - called mine game and then all the images
01:51 - you're gonna put in that folder with
01:53 - your file like this just so they're all
01:55 - in the same directory you could put all
01:57 - the images on your desktop if you want
01:59 - as long as everything's in the same
02:00 - directory this will work
02:02 - okay so let's get into the code then so
02:05 - this is what we had last time we're just
02:08 - pretty much is basically moving around
02:10 - and jumping now the first thing we're
02:12 - gonna do is were actually going to
02:13 - delete a few things and this is just
02:15 - because I realized when I was making the
02:17 - first tutorial that we're kind of gonna
02:19 - move into a platformer game a little bit
02:21 - just to show you we might do some other
02:23 - types of games but we're gonna get rid
02:25 - of the ability to move up and down with
02:27 - your character so the only way we're
02:30 - gonna be able to move up and down is by
02:31 - jumping so we're just gonna delete that
02:33 - line right there that I deleted so we
02:35 - can no longer move our character up and
02:37 - down by just clicking the up and down
02:38 - arrow keys okay and now we're gonna need
02:41 - to set some variables so pretty much
02:42 - what we need to do when we are moving
02:45 - our character is we need to keep track
02:47 - of first of all what direction is our
02:49 - character moving are they moving and how
02:53 - many steps have they already moved now
02:55 - this is important because we need to
02:56 - know what frame or what picture we're
02:58 - gonna be showing on the screen so that
03:01 - we can display it accurately so we're
03:03 - gonna start with our first variable
03:04 - which is gonna be called left we're
03:06 - gonna set that equal to false and then
03:09 - we're gonna do right I set that equal to
03:11 - false low and then we're gonna do walk
03:14 - count we're gonna set that equal to zero
03:17 - now this is a common tedious part here
03:19 - when we want to load an image into PI
03:21 - game it's very simple but if you want to
03:24 - load a lot of images it kind of is
03:26 - tedious so I already have the code to
03:29 - load these images in I'm gonna put it
03:31 - down in the description below to save
03:32 - you guys some time I feel free to type
03:34 - it if you'd like but pretty much just
03:36 - I'm just gonna paste this in here and
03:38 - you guys can go down in the description
03:40 - right now just pause the video quickly
03:41 - and all of this here is gonna be there
03:44 - just simply copy it and paste it and now
03:46 - I'm gonna go over what this code really
03:47 - does
03:48 - so pretty much we start by making two
03:50 - lists so we have the walk write list and
03:52 - the walk left list now it is noted that
03:55 - since these sprites are pretty well
03:57 - identical just flipped from moving right
03:59 - to left we could just flip the PI game
04:01 - image if they're gonna be moving left
04:03 - but I just figured this would be easier
04:04 - for the toriel so we just have two lists
04:06 - so pretty much if we want to load an
04:08 - image in we just start by typing PI game
04:10 - image download like this and then the
04:13 - file name and the extension and
04:16 - is all in quotation marks like this now
04:19 - say for example your file is in a
04:20 - different directory then we have to do
04:23 - something called I game dot path Joanne
04:30 - I believe that's what you do something
04:33 - around something along those lines you
04:35 - can look it up if you guys want so say
04:36 - you want to put all your images into a
04:37 - folder well I really can't tell you
04:40 - canna then what you do is you spy game
04:43 - paths to join and then in here you're
04:45 - gonna put the folder so for example
04:47 - you'd put like data or something like
04:51 - that and then it would join that in you
04:52 - could also just simply type it out but
04:56 - if you get rid of this pygame type out
04:58 - that join here then you can do like I
05:02 - don't know pix /r one like that and it
05:08 - should load your file in so say you want
05:09 - to put them all in a folder then you
05:11 - just have to add this to the beginning
05:12 - of all the lines
05:13 - I hope that makes sense it's not really
05:14 - important for this video I just figured
05:15 - I'd show you guys alright and then we
05:17 - have our background image here which
05:19 - we're gonna replace with that black
05:20 - background it's just a really basic like
05:22 - grass kind of thing I just got it
05:24 - because I wanted to make other than
05:25 - block is the background and then we have
05:27 - our basic standing sprite right here
05:30 - image which is just gonna be our steel
05:31 - image so when the character is not
05:33 - moving or when they're jumping it's
05:35 - gonna show this ok I hope that makes
05:37 - sense you guys now we also need to
05:38 - change this width in this height
05:40 - variable here so since the width of our
05:42 - sprite is can be 64 and the height is
05:44 - gonna be 64 we're gonna change that to
05:46 - this now you'll notice the hitbox on the
05:48 - sprite is gonna be slightly larger than
05:51 - the actual sprite I don't worry about
05:53 - that we can figure that out in another
05:54 - video
05:55 - okay so now another thing we need to do
05:58 - down here is we're gonna get rid of some
06:01 - code here to just kind of clean things
06:02 - up so pretty much whenever you're doing
06:04 - making a pie game you really want to
06:08 - have all your drawing done in one area
06:10 - so it's not a good idea especially if
06:11 - we're gonna be drawing a lot of
06:12 - different objects to be drawing them
06:14 - inside of what we call the main loop so
06:16 - pretty much the main loop is our main
06:18 - while loop which is constantly running
06:20 - and as soon as we exit out loop the game
06:22 - adds so inside of our main loop here we
06:24 - don't want to be drawing anything so
06:26 - we're gonna copy this or cut this
06:28 - and we're gonna put it into a function
06:30 - now again if you guys don't understand a
06:32 - lot of the stuff that I'm talking about
06:33 - here in terms of Python I do recommend
06:35 - you go back and watch my previous videos
06:37 - just my Python programming tutorials
06:40 - maybe if you know a bit skipped like 11
06:43 - or 12 where it starts getting into more
06:45 - complex stuff just because it is kind of
06:47 - a prerequisite and I don't want to go
06:48 - over how all these things work in terms
06:50 - of just basic coding so we're gonna
06:52 - create a function called redraw game
06:56 - window and it's gonna do exactly what it
06:58 - says it's just going to redraw the game
07:00 - window so in here we're gonna well
07:03 - actually we're not going to fill the
07:04 - window but I'll go over that in a second
07:06 - so the first thing we want to do in here
07:08 - is we're actually going to type global
07:09 - and then we're gonna global the variable
07:12 - walk count and this is just because
07:13 - we're gonna be changing this variable so
07:15 - we need to global it at the top here if
07:17 - you don't know what this means don't
07:17 - worry about it pretty much it just
07:19 - allows us to take this variable and make
07:22 - it a global variable because if we were
07:24 - to redefine it in here then it would be
07:26 - an instance of the variable inside this
07:28 - function and it wouldn't be seen outside
07:29 - of it okay so now instead of filling the
07:32 - screen with the color we're actually
07:34 - gonna fill it with a picture so whenever
07:35 - we want to put a picture on the screen
07:37 - in PI game it's pretty easy you just
07:38 - type wind lit and then you're gonna put
07:41 - the name of the picture so since we
07:43 - stored our background to picture in BG
07:46 - we're gonna do BG you know a comma and
07:48 - then a tuple with the position where you
07:50 - want to store it or where you want to
07:52 - place it so in this case we're going to
07:53 - place our background 0 0 and yeah now
07:56 - right now we're currently drawing a
07:58 - rectangle to the screen so we're gonna
08:00 - change that in a second to be the
08:02 - character to be the picture of the
08:03 - character
08:05 - okay so now the thing is though since we
08:07 - took this drawing code out of our main
08:10 - loop we have to make sure we call our
08:12 - function you can call this at the
08:14 - beginning or the end of the main loop I
08:16 - just like to call it at the end so
08:20 - simply redraw a game window two brackets
08:22 - and now whenever we want to change
08:24 - anything in terms of drawing we're only
08:26 - gonna do it in here so we're not gonna
08:27 - draw anything in this loop we're only
08:29 - gonna draw it in this redraw game window
08:31 - right here alright so now we have to get
08:34 - into actually animating the character
08:36 - because if I run the program right now
08:37 - pretty much nothing has changed except
08:39 - we have a background so when we're
08:42 - moving left what we have to say is now
08:44 - we have to make our left variable equal
08:46 - to true and our right variable equal to
08:49 - false this is just so we don't confuse
08:51 - the program we don't have right and left
08:53 - being true so yeah now if we're moving
08:56 - right we're gonna have to set it right
08:58 - variable equal to true and our left
09:01 - variable equal to false and if we're
09:05 - jumping actually we can leave them true
09:08 - false but now if we're not doing
09:10 - anything else we're gonna have to set
09:12 - them equal to false so pretty much we're
09:15 - gonna make this in L if now like that
09:17 - and then at the bottom here we're gonna
09:19 - put an else and rich messed up them both
09:22 - equal to false and we're gonna change
09:25 - our walk count which I'll show you in a
09:27 - second to zero
09:30 - so right left people's Falls and our
09:35 - walk account which is gonna count how
09:36 - many steps we've had pretty much is
09:37 - gonna be equal to zero
09:39 - okay so I know it might seem kind of
09:41 - confusing right now don't worry I'm
09:42 - gonna get into why we're doing all this
09:44 - stuff right ah and yeah okay
09:48 - so now that we know when we're moving
09:50 - right when we're moving left etc
09:52 - actually sorry one sec we have to change
09:54 - in here as well just so that once we
09:56 - click the spacebar we're no longer
09:58 - moving left and right it's gonna look
10:00 - weird on the screen if you see that and
10:04 - walk count equals zero okay so now that
10:09 - we know whether we're moving left or
10:11 - right or we're standing still we need to
10:13 - use that information to draw our
10:15 - character onto the screen so to do that
10:18 - we're gonna go inside of this redraw
10:21 - game window here and we're gonna get rid
10:23 - of this draw rectangle because we're no
10:25 - longer being gonna be drawing a
10:26 - rectangle we're gonna be drawing an
10:27 - image and we're simply gonna start by
10:30 - typing if walk count is greater than or
10:37 - side plus 1 is greater than 27 actually
10:42 - greater than or equal to we'll do that
10:44 - then we are going to set walk out to
10:47 - zero now the reason we're doing this is
10:50 - you'll see in the next thing if we were
10:53 - to try to have our walk count go greater
10:55 - than 27 we're gonna run out of we're
10:59 - gonna run into an index error in here
11:00 - because we have nine sprites and I'm
11:02 - planning on displaying each sprite for
11:04 - three frames and we're gonna have a
11:07 - frame rate which I'm gonna change of 27
11:09 - frames per second I hope that makes
11:11 - sense okay so now we're going to do
11:14 - another if statement we're gonna say if
11:15 - left this means we're moving left
11:18 - then we're gonna want to draw our
11:20 - character left so we're gonna do win
11:22 - golf lit again the cell you draw all
11:24 - your images in PI game we're going to
11:26 - use our walk left list that I created up
11:29 - here and now we're gonna index the
11:31 - correct image so to do that we're gonna
11:34 - have to use our walk count variable like
11:37 - this but instead of just writing walk
11:39 - count we're actually going to integer
11:41 - divide it by three now what integer
11:42 - division does is a
11:43 - just excludes all the remainder all the
11:46 - decimals so if you had 1/3 for example
11:48 - our integer division by three it would
11:50 - be zero if you had four integer division
11:53 - 3 it would be one I pretty
11:55 - straightforward we're going to increment
11:56 - our walk count variables so plus equals
11:59 - one like so now we're gonna do an Elif
12:02 - so if we're moving right we're going to
12:06 - flit to the screen our walk right list
12:09 - with our walk out variable like so walk
12:18 - count plus equal one and if we are not
12:22 - moving right when we are not moving left
12:23 - we must be standing still or jumping so
12:26 - in that case we are just going to pull
12:29 - it's hard character now I notice I
12:32 - forgot to put the tuples in so I will do
12:34 - that now we're still gonna keep using
12:36 - our x and y variable that we did in the
12:38 - first tutorial for moving just because
12:40 - this is gonna keep track of where our
12:41 - character is and it's still going to
12:42 - work even though we're not drawing that
12:44 - rec ting and then we update the screen
12:47 - and yeah that should be working now I'm
12:50 - just gonna go through here and just make
12:51 - sure that I did everything correctly I
12:53 - don't want to have to look through this
12:55 - after yes so there's actually one more
12:58 - thing I think we need to change oh wait
13:00 - no that might be good okay so now we
13:05 - actually need to do the the frame right
13:07 - sorry so I didn't go over this at the
13:08 - beginning but pretty much frame rate is
13:10 - how many frames or how many images you
13:12 - see per second so in every game for
13:15 - example all the shooting games most of
13:16 - them run in like 60 FPS which means you
13:19 - have 60 pictures every second and that's
13:22 - pretty much how video is work if you
13:24 - don't if you don't know it shows a
13:25 - series of images very quickly so that it
13:28 - seems like they are moving but in
13:31 - reality it's just a ton of different
13:32 - pictures running at a frame per second
13:35 - so in our game we're gonna do 27 trades
13:37 - per second just cuz that's how many
13:38 - sprites I have I know it's a weird FPS
13:40 - but let's just forget what we're gonna
13:41 - use so now we need to define something
13:44 - called a clock variable or like a clock
13:46 - speed in PI game so we're gonna do clock
13:49 - equals PI game got time clock like that
13:54 - now this is simply going to allow us to
13:56 - change our
13:57 - FPS in the game now we're going to be a
13:59 - clock dot tick and then twice up and
14:03 - that's just gonna set our FPS to 27 now
14:07 - let's try running the program and see if
14:09 - everything's working so you can see we
14:11 - have our little character here and he
14:13 - moves around the screen like this now
14:15 - just ignore the fact that you see his
14:17 - little feet all over there just cuz the
14:18 - background is not big enough so it's not
14:19 - drawing you can see when he jumps he
14:23 - jumps up like that and that is the
14:26 - character animation so if we want to fix
14:27 - this little thing down here the issue is
14:30 - just that our backgrounds not big enough
14:31 - so we're not actually drawing over the
14:33 - feet of the character so we can't change
14:35 - the height of the screen here to 480
14:39 - we're gonna change our characters
14:41 - position to 400 and now everything
14:44 - should be working yep so now you can see
14:47 - our characters here he moves around the
14:49 - screen like so and you can jump and
14:52 - everything looks pretty good so yeah bad
14:55 - it's been the third tutorial in my
14:57 - pocket ease in the next one I'm not
15:00 - quite sure what we're gonna do but we're
15:02 - probably gonna get into object
15:04 - collisions so for example right now this
15:05 - guy he can't go off the screen because
15:07 - he's colliding with the walls but what
15:09 - if we would have a block in the middle
15:11 - of the room well he wouldn't want him to
15:12 - be able to go over that and maybe
15:13 - jumping on top of the block and yeah so
15:17 - if you guys enjoy the series and you
15:19 - want to see the rest of the videos
