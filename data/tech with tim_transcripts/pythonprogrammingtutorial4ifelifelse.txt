00:01 - hey guys uh welcome back to the fourth
00:04 - video in my Python Programming tutorial
00:06 - Series today we're going to be talking
00:08 - about decisions so we're going to be
00:09 - using the if else and L if statements in
00:13 - Python so pretty much I gave you a
00:16 - little example last time on what these
00:17 - are but if condition
00:21 - equals true
00:23 - then
00:24 - do this
00:27 - sorry not his do this okay so pretty
00:30 - much the Syntax for the basic if
00:32 - statement which is what we are going to
00:34 - cover first is like this so if you
00:37 - remember my last tutorial I talked about
00:39 - conditions if you haven't seen that go
00:42 - back and look at that first because
00:43 - that's going to be an important part of
00:45 - today's lesson and you have to
00:46 - understand that
00:47 - so if condition is true then we are
00:50 - going to do this now let's just dig into
00:53 - the syntax a little bit here
00:56 - um so you're going to start with the
00:57 - keyword if
00:58 - then we're going to put a condition so
01:00 - the condition could be something like
01:01 - this if one is less than two
01:04 - if tree
01:08 - is equal to
01:11 - plant something like that okay anything
01:13 - that can return to true or false value
01:16 - you can use variable names you can say
01:17 - if x is equal to Y anything like that is
01:21 - condition and it uses a conditional
01:23 - operator like I talked about in the last
01:26 - video
01:27 - and then you are going to end your
01:29 - condition with a semicolon or sorry not
01:32 - a semicolon like this with a regular
01:33 - colon and then you're going to Simply
01:36 - click enter and it should tab you in one
01:38 - line now it's very important that you
01:41 - have this indentation if you have your
01:44 - code like this it's not going to work
01:46 - python reads the lines because of
01:49 - indentation so it's very important that
01:51 - you have whatever statements you want to
01:52 - run after the condition returns true
01:55 - indented properly and this will also be
01:58 - very important as we move further on in
02:00 - different tutorials and we have lots of
02:02 - different indentation levels within the
02:04 - program okay so let's do a real example
02:07 - now instead of uh this kind of pseudo
02:09 - code here so we'll start off by just
02:11 - getting some input from the user so
02:13 - let's say
02:14 - let's get their age okay so age is equal
02:17 - to input
02:19 - like this and then just if you put
02:21 - something inside of the input like this
02:23 - it actually gives a prompt to the user
02:25 - so we'll say
02:26 - input
02:28 - your age
02:30 - like that
02:32 - and then we will say
02:34 - if
02:36 - the age is equal to
02:39 - 16
02:41 - then we will print to the screen
02:45 - hey
02:46 - your
02:47 - oops
02:48 - 16 like that okay
02:52 - um all right so let's go ahead and just
02:54 - test it out right away I know I haven't
02:56 - really explained it but I just want to
02:57 - show you how this works
03:00 - okay so we have input your age so I'll
03:02 - say 2 as my age and we can see that
03:06 - nothing happens okay
03:09 - um now I want to show you one more I
03:11 - hope you've caught this trick already
03:12 - from what I talked about in the last
03:13 - videos but we'll see now you notice here
03:16 - I'm going to put in 16.
03:18 - and nothing's gonna happen now the
03:21 - reason for that is because 16 here is
03:25 - different than the 16 that we get from
03:28 - age if you remember whenever we're
03:30 - getting a number or anything from the
03:32 - console we actually get it as a string
03:33 - so this 16 that we're getting actually
03:36 - looks like this now in Python again we
03:38 - have different data types right so this
03:40 - is an integer data type well this is a
03:42 - string so when we're comparing integers
03:44 - and strings they're different so we have
03:46 - to convert our age variable into an
03:50 - integer before we can compare it like
03:52 - that okay now we'll try again
03:55 - say if int age equals 16 so now we put
03:58 - 16 in and says hey you're 16. like that
04:01 - okay
04:02 - um perfect so that's pretty
04:04 - straightforward
04:05 - um now we can also do some other
04:07 - conditions so let's do a greater than 16
04:10 - now okay so this is another conditional
04:12 - operator that we talked about before
04:14 - um and yeah we'll go ahead we'll try it
04:16 - now so we'll say 15.
04:18 - now nothing happened because obviously
04:21 - 15 is not greater than 16.
04:24 - now if we put in 17
04:27 - it works okay
04:29 - great
04:31 - um all right and also uh I just want to
04:33 - show you there's another operator that
04:35 - we didn't talk about last time a
04:36 - conditional operator and it's the
04:38 - greater than or equal to and the less
04:40 - than or equal to so to convert your
04:44 - um greater than sign into a greater than
04:46 - or equal to sign all you have to do is
04:47 - add an equal sign like this and now
04:49 - anything greater than or equal to 16
04:52 - will work whereas before it had to be
04:56 - strictly greater than 16 and same thing
04:57 - with the less than sign
04:59 - like that okay I just forgot to talk
05:01 - about in the other video so I figured
05:03 - I'd put it in here
05:04 - all right
05:05 - um great so let's go into another
05:08 - example then so let's say
05:11 - um it's great it's telling us we're 16.
05:14 - um or let's in this case we're gonna be
05:17 - older than 16 right so hey you're
05:21 - older than 16. but what if we want a
05:24 - message when we are younger than 16.
05:27 - well the way to do this is using
05:29 - something called an else statement so
05:31 - the Syntax for this uh it simply has to
05:33 - come after an if statement you can't
05:36 - just leave your own else statement like
05:37 - this that will not work
05:39 - it has to be after an if statement is
05:41 - placed and then all you have to do is
05:43 - put a colon
05:44 - and click enter and make sure the
05:46 - indentation is the same as the
05:48 - indentation for the first if
05:51 - okay so now we're just going to print
05:54 - U
05:56 - are younger
05:57 - than 16.
06:00 - okay and we can go ahead we can try this
06:01 - to see if the else is going to work and
06:04 - we say
06:05 - over 15 and you are younger than 16.
06:08 - great
06:10 - okay
06:12 - um so just to explain this a little more
06:13 - how this really works when we're reading
06:16 - through the code well python reads code
06:18 - line by line like this now when it
06:21 - reaches this if statement it checks this
06:23 - condition to see if it is true or false
06:25 - so since this condition
06:28 - um was false in the last example we say
06:30 - if false it says Okay so we're not going
06:32 - to run this line of code we're going to
06:34 - skip to the else statement and we're
06:36 - going to do this okay so if we had typed
06:39 - anything in that does not return true so
06:42 - makes this condition not return true
06:43 - then it would go to this else statement
06:46 - like this okay
06:49 - um yeah and then same thing say we type
06:52 - in a number 17 and that is greater than
06:54 - 16 it's not going to do the else
06:56 - statement it's just going to do the if
06:58 - statement okay I hope that makes sense
07:01 - now we're going to go into another layer
07:03 - okay so let's get into a new example
07:05 - here
07:07 - um let's talk about
07:10 - height for a roller coaster okay so for
07:13 - some roller coasters uh you have to be
07:14 - taller than a certain height and you
07:16 - actually can't be too tall right so
07:18 - again we'll get the input from the
07:21 - console so we'll just say
07:23 - height is equal to input
07:26 - and we're just going to do this in
07:27 - meters like one meter two meter three
07:29 - meter just to make it really easy okay I
07:31 - know that's not a realistic height but
07:32 - just for the purpose of this is example
07:34 - so we say height is equal to input
07:37 - um again we have to remember that one
07:40 - we're going to check the condition we
07:42 - have to make sure we put it in the int
07:43 - because as we get it from the console
07:45 - it's going to be a string okay so we'll
07:46 - say if height is less than
07:50 - one meter
07:52 - we're going to say you cannot ride so
07:54 - we're going to print to the screen
07:57 - you cannot ride okay now we only want to
08:01 - allow the user to ride if their height
08:04 - is in between one meter but less than
08:08 - two meters okay so as you can see I've
08:11 - introduced a new word here called L if
08:14 - all right so this means
08:16 - if this condition up here is false then
08:20 - we're going to go to this one we're
08:21 - going to check if this condition is true
08:23 - or false if it's true we're going to run
08:25 - whatever's in here
08:26 - otherwise we're going to keep going so
08:29 - you can have as many l ifs as you
08:32 - possibly want
08:33 - in a decision statement like this okay
08:37 - you can only have one else though
08:39 - because else is just the default so
08:41 - anything you type in
08:42 - um that doesn't equal any of these
08:44 - statements so like if isn't true all if
08:47 - isn't true the other LF isn't true then
08:48 - it'll go to the else statement okay
08:50 - so elif
08:52 - the height
08:55 - is so if it's less than one you can't
08:59 - ride and if it is greater than two
09:03 - you also can't ride
09:05 - so we're going to say
09:08 - you
09:09 - cannot ride
09:11 - I'm gonna say and we'll say over 2
09:14 - meters and then we'll put here
09:17 - just so we can distinct them under one
09:21 - meter okay and then now we're going to
09:23 - add in the else statement like this
09:25 - we're going to say print
09:28 - you can write okay so I know I just did
09:32 - a lot there so we'll go through it
09:33 - quickly
09:34 - we pretty much have a condition up here
09:36 - we already talked about the if statement
09:38 - so if this condition is true we're going
09:40 - to print this and we're going to skip
09:42 - everything else we're not even going to
09:44 - bother reading it because we know that
09:46 - it's not going to be any of those
09:47 - conditions okay so now we do the elif
09:49 - here right so we say well if this
09:52 - condition is false we're going to go
09:54 - ahead and we're going to check this
09:55 - condition so we say oh well this one's
09:57 - true so then we're going to execute this
09:59 - line of code which is the print and
10:00 - we're not going to do this else
10:02 - statement now say we go through these
10:04 - two and they're both false okay so this
10:07 - returned false and this return false
10:09 - then we're going to go to the else and
10:11 - we're automatically just going to print
10:13 - whatever is in the else statement like
10:15 - that okay so we'll go ahead uh we'll run
10:18 - the program and we'll try it out make
10:20 - sure I haven't made any errors here okay
10:21 - so the input I didn't give a prompt so
10:24 - I'm just going to type in the height uh
10:25 - a number all right so we'll say
10:28 - one
10:29 - you can ride great okay that is because
10:33 - again we have the strictly less than
10:35 - sign now if we wanted it to be you have
10:38 - to be over one foot we just put an equal
10:40 - sign here and then same thing here okay
10:43 - so we'll do that and now I'll show you
10:44 - again
10:46 - if I put in
10:47 - one
10:49 - you cannot ride under one meter
10:52 - okay so less than or equal to one right
10:54 - okay
10:56 - um let's try again now we'll do it maybe
10:58 - in number greater than two so let's say
11:00 - we put four it says you cannot ride
11:02 - because you are over two meters and then
11:05 - again if we do like a decimal number
11:07 - maybe uh
11:08 - 1.1
11:10 - Okay so we've run into an error there
11:12 - that's fine just because we can't
11:13 - convert a floating decimal point into an
11:15 - integer but yeah I hope you get the
11:16 - point from that example here these are
11:19 - just the basic if elif and else
11:22 - statements I'll do one more just to show
11:23 - you here we could do another LF here
11:25 - saying for example um if int height
11:29 - is equal to remember we do two equal
11:32 - signs right not one
11:33 - then we're going to say
11:36 - print
11:38 - wow you are tall
11:42 - okay so as you can see we can do
11:44 - infinite elf State L if statements like
11:47 - this and we can only have one else
11:48 - statement and one if statement at the
11:51 - beginning okay
11:53 - uh so we'll run this one just to show
11:54 - you one more time how this works I'll
11:56 - put in five so five
11:59 - uh you cannot write over two meters okay
12:01 - so that's because what actually happened
12:03 - here is we went if we checked this
12:06 - condition now it turns out that
12:08 - um 5 is greater than two so we did this
12:11 - one and we didn't bother reading the
12:12 - rest now if I wanted to change this uh
12:15 - so that it would check the five first
12:17 - all I would have to do is put this alif
12:19 - statement I'll do it right now
12:22 - above the other L if statement
12:26 - like this
12:27 - and now
12:30 - if I type in five it'll work wow you are
12:33 - tall
12:34 - okay so uh that's it for the if elif and
12:38 - L statements in the next tutorial we're
12:41 - going to go into something called chain
12:42 - conditionals and do some more advanced
12:44 - examples of this we're going to do some
12:45 - addition subtraction and some more
12:47 - things with other operators okay so I
12:49 - hope you enjoyed
12:51 - um please don't forget to like And
12:53 - subscribe the video and I'll see you
12:54 - again tomorrow
