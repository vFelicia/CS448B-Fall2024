00:00 - hello everyone and welcome back so in
00:02 - this voice assistant tutorial what we're
00:03 - gonna be doing is using the voice
00:05 - assistant to actually open up
00:06 - applications for us and to take notes so
00:09 - what I want to do in this want to show
00:10 - you guys how we can actually open an
00:12 - application from Python what I mean by
00:14 - that is like launch a web browser or
00:15 - launch in this case actually notepad
00:17 - what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna write a
00:19 - note into a notepad based on what we say
00:21 - to the voice assistant then it's gonna
00:23 - open up that note for us on the computer
00:25 - I think this is kind of useful and it
00:26 - should hopefully show you a few kind of
00:28 - things you can do and then you guys can
00:29 - tweak it and mess with it to make it
00:31 - what you guys want for your voice
00:33 - assistant so what I'm gonna do to start
00:35 - actually start let's go back up to the
00:36 - top here is import sub-process now what
00:39 - this is gonna do is just allow us to
00:41 - actually open well a subprocess which is
00:43 - gonna be notepad and show that on the
00:46 - screen now I'm also gonna create a
00:48 - function here which is gonna be called
00:51 - note and what this is gonna do is
00:52 - exactly what it says is just gonna take
00:54 - a note for us so we're gonna take some
00:56 - kind of text and that's gonna be the
00:57 - actual note that we're gonna write into
00:59 - a notepad so what I'm going to start by
01:01 - doing is creating like we need to create
01:03 - a notepad file so that we can actually
01:04 - open it so what I need to do is figure
01:07 - out what kind of name I should make this
01:09 - so we're gonna save it in the same
01:10 - directory as our voice assistant but
01:13 - what makes sense to name this file I
01:14 - can't really just choose like a static
01:16 - name like note or like my note because
01:19 - then if we have more than one note that
01:21 - we make it'll override the last note
01:23 - that's what I'm gonna do actually is say
01:26 - dates equals date/time dot date time
01:31 - done now which is gonna give me the date
01:33 - and time at the current moment so what
01:36 - I'm gonna do is save a file as like date
01:39 - like whatever the date and the time is
01:40 - dot note or like dot txt so that we can
01:43 - have as many files as we wanted to all
01:45 - be organized by the date that they were
01:46 - created now I'm going to create a new
01:49 - thing here new variable called file name
01:51 - which can equal to the string date dot
01:54 - replace in this case colon with a hyphen
01:59 - plus I'm gonna say - note dot txt so
02:05 - what this is gonna do is define that our
02:06 - file name is gonna be equal to whatever
02:08 - this date is which is gonna be like
02:10 - twenty nineteen oh eight seven at
02:12 - like 3:45 p.m. whatever it is but what
02:15 - I'm gonna do is replace all the colons
02:17 - that are in there with hyphens and not
02:18 - just because we can't save a filename
02:20 - with colons we'll run into errors if we
02:21 - try to do that and then I'm gonna add a
02:23 - hyphen note txt at the end of that so we
02:25 - know that this is a note and it is a txt
02:27 - file so now what I'm going to do say
02:29 - with open and here file underscore name
02:32 - W which stands for write mode or create
02:35 - a new file if it doesn't already exist
02:37 - as F I'm gonna f dot write whatever that
02:40 - text is that we passed in okay so that's
02:43 - pretty straightforward and then what I'm
02:45 - gonna do is say sub-process dot p open
02:50 - and make sure you do a capital there and
02:52 - in here I'm gonna put square brackets
02:54 - for a list I'm gonna put the name of the
02:57 - file I'm going to open this insert
02:58 - notepad.exe and then I'm gonna put file
03:01 - underscore name so what this actually
03:03 - means is open the file name in
03:07 - notepad.exe an open e XE comes with all
03:10 - windows installation so you don't need
03:12 - to download this and to use another
03:14 - program what you need to do is in here
03:17 - specify the path to that program and the
03:20 - dot exe file so say you want to open it
03:22 - in like sub line text well you need to
03:25 - find where that is so I would get open
03:27 - file location' here it shows me this is
03:29 - the shortcut for sub line text 3 so if I
03:31 - want to open in sublime text 3 well now
03:33 - I figure need to figure out where this
03:34 - is so I go open file location' this is
03:36 - the Exe
03:38 - so I can copy this directory which is
03:40 - right here so up at the top if I could
03:43 - get that and then do slash sub line text
03:45 - exe and then it would open in that you
03:47 - know what I'm actually gonna do this I'm
03:49 - gonna say its sub line and I'm gonna try
03:51 - to do it in this one as well just to
03:52 - show you how this works so then we do
03:54 - another slash and then it's gonna be sub
03:55 - line underscore text don't yet see and
03:59 - we need to put this in brackets so I'll
04:00 - try to open in both them and show you
04:01 - guys actually how this works so before
04:04 - actually you know like call this
04:05 - properly and write some more code down
04:07 - here let's make sure that this is
04:08 - working I'm just gonna comment out all
04:10 - of this here and what I'm gonna do is
04:13 - just call this function so I'm gonna say
04:14 - note and then we'll put tech with Tim is
04:19 - the best okay so let's run this and
04:23 - where we go when we do that we actually
04:25 - see that a notepad
04:26 - pops up that says tech with Tim is the
04:28 - best and you can see the name of it I
04:30 - mean it's kind of small on my screen is
04:32 - 20 1909 14 and then 14 27 41 so it's
04:37 - pretty much just listing the time here -
04:39 - note tht is the name of that note so I
04:41 - know it's long you guys can change that
04:43 - if you want and then you can see that
04:44 - it's saved inside of here in our voice
04:47 - assistant directory okay so now that
04:49 - we've done that let's try this with
04:50 - sub-line not really confident and this
04:53 - is gonna work but we'll see run oh and
04:56 - there we go Tech with Tim is the best
04:58 - and that opened it in sub line text for
05:00 - us so again the way I did that was just
05:02 - find the exe for sub line text I put
05:05 - that as the first thing so the exact
05:07 - path to it and then the file that I
05:09 - wanted to open which was notepad and
05:11 - conveniently this worked for us I'm not
05:13 - gonna lie didn't think that would work
05:14 - but anyways there we go we got that so
05:16 - that does work awesome so I'm gonna get
05:18 - rid of sub links actually do want this
05:20 - to open in notepad Exe I'm so it'll work
05:23 - on any computer that does have windows
05:26 - on it and now that we've done that we
05:28 - need a good way to actually call this
05:29 - function just like what we've done down
05:31 - here when we check you know if we're
05:34 - gonna actually tell us about our
05:35 - calendar and on so essentially what do
05:37 - we need to say to our voice assistant
05:39 - for it to make a note for us well I'm
05:42 - gonna make some kind of phrases that I
05:44 - would maybe want to say for it to make a
05:46 - note so I'd say like make a note that's
05:49 - probably something that we're gonna want
05:51 - to make a note with we say that maybe
05:53 - write this down we could do remember
05:59 - this like that and I mean I'm sure you
06:02 - could add some more but I'm just gonna
06:03 - leave it like that for now and you guys
06:05 - can mess with that and what I'm actually
06:06 - gonna do is just copy this actually I
06:08 - won't copy it I'll just type it out I'll
06:09 - say for raise in note underscore strings
06:14 - if phrase in text and what I'm actually
06:20 - gonna do is just make a quick change
06:21 - here I'm gonna get rid of this dot lower
06:23 - here and just add it at the end of get
06:25 - audio just so that saves us a bit of
06:27 - time here and then we will do is if
06:29 - phrase in text what I'm gonna do is ask
06:32 - the user to tell me what they want to
06:35 - write down so essentially like maybe you
06:37 - go like hey Siri or like whatever your
06:39 - voice assistant is
06:40 - make a note so if you say it make a note
06:42 - then what it's gonna say back is what do
06:44 - you want me to write down or what do you
06:46 - want me to make a note of so what I'm
06:47 - gonna do here is I'm gonna say speak
06:50 - what would you like me to write down
06:57 - question then what I'm gonna do is get
07:00 - the audio from this so we'll say like I
07:01 - don't know note equals get underscore
07:04 - audio and we'll put that actually yeah I
07:08 - guess we'll put that in dot lower as
07:09 - well and then what we're gonna do is
07:10 - we're gonna pass that to this note
07:12 - function so we'll say note and then
07:16 - we'll pass note like that or actually I
07:18 - don't think I can name this note let's
07:19 - just name it like note underscore text
07:22 - we don't run into any issues so let's
07:24 - say note note underscore text and then
07:26 - we will speak I've made a note back
07:32 - awesome so that is all we kind of need
07:35 - to do actually I think for this to work
07:37 - so now in theory we should be able to
07:39 - speak to our voice assistant ask it to
07:41 - make a note it'll tell it asked us what
07:42 - we want to make a note of it will listen
07:44 - for us to say something then it will
07:46 - make a note of that open up the notepad
07:47 - window and then tell us that we've made
07:48 - a note of it so let's try this
07:52 - make a note Tim is the best and there we
08:03 - go
08:03 - Tim is the best so that actually worked
08:04 - fairly well and fairly quickly and there
08:08 - we go so now we have these notepad files
08:09 - up here we've written or wrote down Tim
08:12 - as the best and that worked for us now I
08:15 - hope you guys are able to actually hear
08:16 - this audio I'll try one more example now
08:18 - with like write this down write this
08:22 - down this voice assistant tutorial is
08:28 - cool and there we go this voice
08:33 - assistant tutorial is cool and it's made
08:35 - a note so that is kind of all it is to
08:37 - making notes I mean we might want to
08:39 - clean this up by adding a notes
08:40 - directory in here and saving all the
08:42 - files in there but that is again I mean
08:44 - how you write a note how you get it to
08:47 - open up the notepad for you which we've
08:48 - been doing each time and how we can
08:50 - check to make sure we're saying the
08:51 - correct thing
08:52 - we do that now show you this is still
08:54 - working what do I have on Wednesday you
09:00 - have until this day my director like 1
09:07 - p.m. 21:10 toriel p.m. and we can see
09:12 - that that is now still working so
09:14 - depending on what we say we get
09:15 - different responses from our assistant
09:16 - and we're making our way towards a very
09:18 - smart cool voice assistant so with that
09:21 - being said I'm gonna wrap up the video
09:22 - here as always leave a comment down
09:24 - below with stuff you want to see for the
09:25 - rest of this voice assistant tutorial
09:27 - series and with that being said I will
09:28 - see you guys in the neck
