00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - hello everybody and welcome to a brand
00:10 - new tutorial series on
00:12 - react now in case you're unfamiliar with
00:14 - react this is a front-end web framework
00:16 - that is used to build user interfaces
00:18 - it is powered by javascript and i
00:20 - actually believe that this was created
00:22 - and is currently maintained by facebook
00:24 - and the entire library
00:25 - to my knowledge is open source now react
00:28 - is just a super popular and
00:30 - really good thing to know now in 2021 it
00:32 - allows you to kind of make more advanced
00:34 - websites and to go beyond really simple
00:36 - user interfaces and make user interfaces
00:39 - that have a lot of logic behind them
00:41 - now just bear with me for this short
00:42 - introduction here i'm just going to talk
00:44 - about some prerequisites kind of for
00:45 - this tutorial series
00:46 - and what you can expect to learn by the
00:48 - end of it so as i said react is powered
00:50 - by javascript
00:51 - so it's going to be a really good idea
00:53 - to have some javascript knowledge before
00:54 - going through this i'm not going to be
00:56 - explaining any super basic syntax like
00:58 - functions if statements anything like
01:00 - that
01:00 - i'm going to assume you have some
01:01 - familiarity with javascript and you've
01:03 - used it before
01:04 - with that said if you don't i do have a
01:06 - tutorial series on javascript i will
01:08 - leave a link to that
01:09 - in the description now throughout these
01:11 - next videos there's probably going to be
01:12 - about 15 of them
01:14 - i'm going to show you all of the core
01:15 - and important concepts of react so
01:18 - that's going to include stuff like
01:19 - components and jsx
01:21 - props styling state i'm going to show
01:23 - you about events
01:24 - forums how we can display data i'm going
01:26 - to talk to you about setting up a very
01:28 - basic json server
01:29 - talk about hooks use effect fetch http
01:33 - react router reducers all of that kind
01:35 - of stuff really the core
01:36 - aspects of react now if you don't know
01:39 - what any of that stuff means don't worry
01:40 - obviously i will explain it in depth
01:42 - i'm going to try to keep these videos
01:44 - relatively short and kind of just pack
01:46 - in
01:46 - one topic in each video now throughout
01:49 - this series we'll be actually building a
01:51 - project to learn all of this the project
01:53 - we're going to be working on is an
01:54 - inventory management system
01:56 - this is going to be pretty
01:56 - straightforward but we're going to be
01:58 - able to add items to the inventory
02:00 - search items in the inventory and then
02:01 - obviously display those items on the
02:03 - screen and kind of
02:04 - look at details related to them all
02:06 - right so with that said let's get into
02:08 - the first video here
02:09 - what i'm going to show you how to do is
02:10 - set up our programming environment
02:12 - download our editors download node.js
02:15 - and all of those things that we need
02:16 - so the first thing we're going to do
02:18 - here is we're going to go to our web
02:19 - browser and we need to install the
02:21 - following
02:22 - visual studio code node.js and then the
02:24 - react
02:25 - developer tools this is a chrome
02:27 - extension i believe there's an extension
02:28 - for firefox as well
02:30 - but i'm going to be using chrome for
02:31 - this video so if you want to follow
02:32 - along exactly then download chrome
02:34 - and download react developer tools now
02:36 - all three of these links here will be in
02:38 - the description
02:39 - start with vs code then download node.js
02:42 - you can just run through the kind of
02:43 - default installation
02:44 - and then obviously install the react
02:46 - developer tools in chrome
02:48 - all right so once you have all of those
02:50 - installed what you're going to do is
02:51 - open up visual studio code
02:53 - this is an ide and that's what we're
02:55 - going to be using to write our
02:56 - react code now you don't need to use vs
02:59 - code this is going to make our life a
03:00 - lot easier
03:02 - you're going to see here that there's a
03:03 - lot of files that's involved in creating
03:04 - a react application
03:06 - and while using something like vs code
03:07 - will just make stuff a lot simpler it
03:09 - has really good auto complete
03:10 - and it's good to kind of get used to
03:12 - using an ide
03:14 - especially when you're working with a
03:15 - large framework like react
03:17 - regardless the first thing we're going
03:18 - to do here is install an extension so
03:20 - open up visual studio code mine's in
03:21 - full screen mode yours might look like
03:23 - this
03:24 - to put in full screen mode you press f11
03:26 - if you are on
03:27 - windows then press here on this
03:29 - extensions tab
03:30 - kind of the little grid with that box
03:32 - hanging out what you're going to do is
03:34 - search for
03:34 - react and you should see that there's
03:37 - this es7 react slash redux
03:39 - graphql whatever snippets what you're
03:42 - going to do is install that
03:43 - and then this will give you a bunch of
03:45 - auto completion and just kind of cool
03:47 - features related to react so that we'll
03:49 - have a better experience here in visual
03:50 - studio code
03:51 - once we've done that what we're going to
03:53 - do is open up a folder or
03:55 - create a new folder in vs code and this
03:57 - is where we'll kind of start our project
03:59 - so what you can do is you can go to the
04:01 - files tab here in vs code and press
04:03 - open folder or you can press file and
04:05 - then open folder
04:06 - you can go to wherever you want to open
04:08 - the folder for so i'm going to go to my
04:09 - desktop
04:10 - i'm going to create a new folder i'm
04:12 - going to call this react
04:14 - tutorial and i'm just going to put
04:15 - working because i have another folder
04:17 - called react tutorial where i have
04:18 - some kind of template code just for
04:20 - myself and regardless i'm going to open
04:22 - up
04:22 - react tutorial awesome so now you can
04:25 - see that it says react tutorial we're
04:26 - now in this kind of
04:28 - project directory we could call it and
04:30 - what we're going to do is open up the
04:31 - terminal in visual studio code so to do
04:34 - that just kind of drag up from the
04:35 - bottom here you should see a terminal
04:37 - pops up
04:38 - and then we're going to type in the
04:39 - following command
04:41 - to actually start and create kind of a
04:43 - template react
04:44 - project so once you've installed node.js
04:47 - you should be able to run the command
04:48 - npx when you run that you should get
04:51 - some type of output if for some reason
04:52 - that's not working
04:54 - then probably reinstall node.js because
04:56 - that should work for you
04:58 - now if npx is working and hopefully it
05:00 - is what you're going to do is type
05:02 - npx and then create hyphen
05:05 - react hyphen app and then you're going
05:07 - to with the name of your app so in this
05:09 - case
05:10 - our app is going to be an inventory
05:12 - management system so i'm just going to
05:13 - say
05:14 - inventory will be the name of our react
05:16 - app so again npx
05:17 - create to react app and then inventory
05:19 - and notice here that i'm in the
05:21 - directory where i want to create this
05:23 - folder so i'm in my react tutorial
05:25 - and when you open the uh the terminal
05:26 - nvs code by default it's going to put
05:28 - you into the directory that you have
05:29 - open
05:30 - so anyways i'm going to press enter here
05:32 - and this command is going to take a
05:33 - minute or two to run it's just going to
05:34 - install a ton of stuff and give us kind
05:36 - of some template code so once this is
05:38 - done i will be right
05:39 - back so we will continue in one second
05:41 - but i need to quickly thank the sponsor
05:43 - of this video and this series which is
05:44 - alco
05:45 - expert algo expert is the best platform
05:47 - to use from preparing for your software
05:49 - engineering coding interviews
05:50 - they have over 155 coding interview
05:52 - questions on the platform
05:54 - which are taught by great instructors
05:56 - including myself
05:58 - get started with algo expert today by
05:59 - clicking the link in the description and
06:01 - using the code tech with tim for a
06:02 - discount on the platform alright so the
06:04 - command has
06:05 - just finished running you can see here
06:07 - there was a ton of output in the
06:08 - terminal a bunch of stuff was being
06:10 - installed
06:10 - and now we're getting this kind of nice
06:12 - uh i don't know output here that's
06:14 - saying
06:14 - success created inventory at and then
06:17 - the location
06:17 - inside the directory you can run several
06:19 - commands yarn start
06:21 - yarn build yarn test and yarn eject now
06:24 - you can read through these if you would
06:25 - like but obviously i'll discuss them
06:26 - myself
06:27 - as we kind of go through this so if you
06:29 - look now inside of your folder
06:31 - you should see that you have a ton of
06:33 - files inside of this inventory folder
06:35 - so you have node modules public src and
06:38 - then you have a few files here
06:39 - now i'm not really going to discuss all
06:41 - these right now in the next video go
06:42 - through what all of these files are and
06:44 - what ones you can change and deleting
06:46 - kind of how everything works but for now
06:48 - i want to show you how we can actually
06:49 - run
06:50 - our kind of development server and start
06:51 - seeing our sample react
06:53 - app so just to clarify here the command
06:56 - that we typed in
06:57 - this creates kind of the starting react
06:59 - app for us
07:00 - it does all of this really annoying
07:01 - setup yes you can set up a react app
07:03 - manually if you would like to
07:05 - but running this command just saves you
07:06 - honestly probably about half an hour
07:08 - uh if you were trying to look up and
07:10 - find how find how to do this for the
07:11 - first time
07:12 - regardless what we're going to do now is
07:14 - cd into our inventory folder
07:17 - and now that we're in our inventory
07:18 - folder in our command prompt
07:20 - what we're going to do is type yarn and
07:22 - then start
07:24 - now yarn is just kind of a package
07:26 - manager it's very similar to
07:27 - npm and when you do this what it's going
07:29 - to do is run a script
07:31 - that by default is kind of set up and
07:33 - installed when you run that command
07:35 - and it will load your development server
07:37 - for you now you should see that it opens
07:39 - in your default web browser
07:41 - local host colon 3000 this is the
07:43 - address or the location
07:44 - of your kind of development server where
07:47 - all of our react stuff is going to be
07:48 - rendered and shown and right now you can
07:50 - see it says edit
07:51 - src slash app.js and save to reload
07:54 - and then there's kind of a spinning
07:55 - little react logo here and this is what
07:57 - the starting code will do for you it
07:58 - just creates this kind of very simple
08:00 - web page here
08:01 - so you can go here now and it says
08:02 - you've uh you can now view inventory in
08:04 - the browser
08:05 - you can go to localhost colon 3000 or
08:08 - what you can do is go to the ip address
08:10 - of your machine colon 3000 this just
08:12 - running on your local area network
08:13 - so if you were to go to your phone or
08:14 - something and type in this command
08:16 - you'd actually see the the same
08:18 - application great
08:20 - okay so now let's just quickly make a
08:22 - change so i can show you kind of how
08:23 - this works so i'm going to put this on
08:25 - the side of my
08:26 - screen let me move this a bit smaller
08:28 - i'm going to go into
08:29 - src app.js and let me just kind of move
08:33 - this down here
08:34 - i just want to make a quick change to
08:36 - this paragraph tag
08:38 - and show you that this file right here
08:39 - is kind of what's being rendered on the
08:41 - screen so again if you went to inventory
08:43 - src
08:43 - app.js now we're just going to change
08:46 - this p tag and say
08:48 - my website is running exclamation point
08:52 - i'm going to save this file when i save
08:54 - this file it will automatically reload
08:56 - the website
08:57 - and you can see it says my website is
08:58 - running if we go back to the terminal
09:00 - it should give us some output here
09:02 - saying that it kind of reloaded this
09:04 - let's look here okay i guess it's not
09:06 - going to tell us anything that's fine
09:07 - but regardless this is kind of like a
09:08 - hot reload
09:10 - we didn't have to manually reload the
09:11 - server it just automatically determined
09:13 - there was a change to the file
09:14 - and well it updated it for us okay so
09:17 - that's pretty much all i needed to show
09:18 - you to actually
09:19 - set up your kind of environment and
09:21 - start getting coding the next thing i'm
09:23 - going to show you here is the react
09:24 - developer tools i'll just kind of really
09:26 - quickly go through these and then we'll
09:27 - look at them more in depth when we
09:29 - actually start writing some code
09:30 - so obviously i have my react application
09:32 - open here on local host colon 3000
09:34 - that's the port i believe
09:36 - you can change that but by default this
09:37 - should be what yours is running on
09:39 - what you can do now is right click if
09:41 - you're on chrome here press
09:42 - inspect and then you're going to see
09:44 - that it brings up this kind of console
09:46 - so what you can do is actually go to
09:48 - these little arrows here and you should
09:50 - see something that says components and
09:52 - profiler this is if you have
09:54 - the react developer tools chrome
09:56 - extension installed and it's active
09:58 - so what you're going to do now is press
09:59 - on components what you can see is we
10:01 - have this one component called app this
10:02 - probably doesn't mean anything to you
10:04 - right now if you're just getting started
10:05 - with react
10:06 - but this is kind of a place that we can
10:07 - go to look at and inspect our react code
10:10 - and this will make a lot more sense
10:12 - once we actually have something
10:13 - interesting to look at i also note
10:15 - there's something called a profiler this
10:17 - is actually what we can do to kind of
10:18 - measure or sorry what we can use to kind
10:20 - of measure the performance of our react
10:22 - code
10:23 - anyways i just wanted to show you those
10:24 - two tabs there and how you kind of
10:25 - access
10:26 - the react developer tools pane from
10:29 - google chrome
10:30 - all right so actually with that i'm
10:31 - going to leave the video here in the
10:33 - next video i'm going to go through this
10:35 - entire project structure so it was
10:37 - automatically generated for us
10:38 - discuss what all these files mean talk
10:40 - about kind of how things are set up and
10:42 - how react
10:43 - actually works and then from there we'll
10:45 - go on and actually start writing some
10:46 - react code
10:47 - and learn more about this as i said at
10:49 - the beginning i'm trying to keep these
10:50 - videos relatively short
10:52 - anyways hopefully you guys are excited
10:53 - again please do leave a comment letting
10:55 - me know what you want to see
10:56 - in this series i'm not yet filmed all
10:58 - these videos when this is going to be
11:00 - released with that said i will see you
11:01 - in the next react
11:04 - [Music]
