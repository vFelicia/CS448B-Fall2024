00:08 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:10 - react tutorial for beginners
00:12 - in this video i'm going to be showing
00:13 - you how we can actually filter
00:15 - our data so in previous videos we've set
00:17 - all this stuff up
00:18 - we've done the styling but our search
00:20 - bar doesn't work right when we actually
00:22 - search for something it doesn't do
00:23 - anything
00:24 - so in this video i'm going to show you
00:25 - how we can make that work so filter the
00:27 - different items that we have
00:28 - in our data this will be a shorter video
00:30 - but that's all we need to do
00:31 - all right so let's go ahead and get
00:32 - started we can see here that we already
00:34 - have our filters right
00:35 - we've set this up already such that when
00:37 - you press the search button it passes
00:39 - the filters back to app.js
00:40 - so kind of the hard part there is
00:42 - actually done all we need to do here is
00:44 - use these filters to actually filter our
00:47 - data
00:47 - so we have two options here we could and
00:50 - ignore this i was
00:51 - working on this previously ignore that
00:52 - function call pretend you didn't see
00:54 - that so we have two options here is
00:55 - where i was saying
00:56 - we could filter the data inside of items
00:59 - display
01:00 - so we could pass the items to items
01:01 - display we could also pass the filters
01:04 - and then inside of here we could do the
01:05 - filter
01:06 - that makes sense we could do that that's
01:07 - fine nothing wrong with that but i would
01:09 - prefer
01:10 - to not have to pass the filters to this
01:12 - component
01:13 - and to instead filter the data inside of
01:15 - this app component
01:16 - and only pass the data that i want to be
01:18 - displayed to the items display component
01:21 - so two different options here again you
01:22 - can use whatever you want but i kind of
01:24 - prefer to not have a ton of props being
01:26 - passed around because it gets kind of
01:27 - confusing and instead use the prompt
01:29 - where i have it right so in this case i
01:31 - have filters sorry which is a state
01:33 - and so what i can do is just use it to
01:35 - filter the data and then i can pass my
01:36 - filter data as
01:38 - items so rather than passing all of the
01:40 - items then filtering it i'm just passing
01:42 - the items i actually want to display
01:44 - again you can make arguments for which
01:45 - one is better or worse but for now we're
01:47 - going to do this
01:48 - so i'm going to make a function here i'm
01:49 - going to say const and you already
01:51 - guessed what this is it's going to be
01:52 - filter
01:53 - data like that this will be equal to an
01:56 - arrow function
01:57 - this will take in some data and what
01:59 - this is going to return will be an array
02:01 - with all of my filtered data so all the
02:03 - items that i actually want to display
02:06 - so i'm going to start by saying const
02:08 - and i'll say filtered
02:10 - data like that is equal to and this will
02:12 - just be an array
02:13 - so it will actually return here will be
02:15 - our filtered data
02:17 - but now we need to fill this array with
02:19 - that data so what i'll do here
02:21 - is i'll loop through all of the items in
02:23 - my data
02:24 - and then i will check if these items
02:27 - match the criteria in my filters
02:29 - so let's look at filters if we go to
02:30 - search bar we can see we have name
02:32 - price type and brand that's what our
02:34 - filters are going to be
02:36 - but some of these filters could be their
02:38 - default value
02:39 - they could be an empty string it could
02:40 - be 0 for example and so before i
02:43 - actually apply this filter
02:44 - i want to make sure it's not its default
02:46 - value because i don't want to filter
02:48 - based on say an empty string because
02:50 - that was just the default value the user
02:51 - didn't actually type something in there
02:53 - so let's go ahead and do that so if we
02:55 - go here filter data i'm going to start
02:57 - by looping through all my items so i'm
02:58 - going to say 4
02:59 - and i'll say const and this will be item
03:02 - of
03:03 - data now just so we're clear on what
03:05 - data will be
03:06 - data will just be a list so what we'll
03:08 - actually do here is we'll call
03:11 - filter data as you saw i did previously
03:14 - and we will pass a list of the items we
03:16 - want to filter so we'll pass
03:18 - data and the key items because we're
03:19 - holding a uh what is it
03:21 - an actual object here it has the key
03:23 - items and the key items has an array
03:25 - okay so we pass the array to filter data
03:28 - and then we're going to loop through it
03:29 - so go through all of the items now we're
03:32 - going to check
03:33 - if the field in our filter is actually
03:35 - not the default value and if it's not
03:37 - we'll
03:37 - kind of apply that filter so we're going
03:39 - to say if
03:40 - and this will be filters dot name
03:43 - does not equal an empty string so
03:45 - filters.name does not equal an empty
03:47 - string
03:48 - we want to apply that filter so then
03:49 - inside of here we'll have another if
03:51 - statement
03:51 - and we'll say if item dot name
03:55 - does not equal and this will be filters
03:58 - dot name then what we can do is we can
04:02 - simply
04:04 - continue we don't actually need all
04:06 - these curly braces but i'll just leave
04:07 - them
04:08 - in here for now because i think it makes
04:09 - sense i'm trying to see if there's a way
04:11 - that we
04:12 - can actually combine these together
04:15 - i think i can do something like this so
04:18 - i'm going to say
04:19 - if filters.name does not equal empty
04:21 - string and item.name does not equal
04:23 - filters.name continue okay so that's
04:25 - good that's the expression that we want
04:27 - here
04:27 - so the reason for this is we need to
04:28 - first check to make sure it's not an
04:30 - empty string
04:30 - if it's not an empty string and the name
04:33 - of our item
04:34 - does not equal the filter that we have
04:35 - then we're going to continue which means
04:37 - we're not going to add this item
04:39 - into our filtered data and so we're kind
04:40 - of skipping it in that sense okay so
04:42 - let's copy this
04:43 - and now we're going to do the same thing
04:45 - except this time we're going to check
04:46 - price so it'll be a little bit different
04:47 - we'll say
04:47 - filters.price does not equal equal zero
04:51 - and item.price and remember this is the
04:53 - maximum price
04:55 - if item.price is we'll say greater than
04:59 - and then this will be filters.price then
05:01 - same thing we want to continue because
05:03 - we're above the maximum price we don't
05:04 - want to add this item in
05:06 - okay so same thing now except instead of
05:08 - name we're going to have
05:09 - type okay so now we'll just change these
05:11 - to be type
05:12 - and this will all work because type is
05:14 - just going to be a string
05:16 - okay and then lastly we had
05:19 - name price type and brand so let's make
05:23 - this brand
05:24 - okay brand and
05:27 - brand and by the way continue will just
05:29 - automatically move us back to the next
05:31 - item
05:31 - so we'll just skip this item essentially
05:33 - when we hit continue so we'll go to the
05:34 - next iteration of the for loop
05:36 - and then at the very bottom here we will
05:38 - say filter data
05:40 - dot push and we'll push on this item
05:43 - if of course it made it to this stage
05:45 - alright so let's quickly recap what
05:47 - we're doing here
05:47 - we're just going to check all of the
05:49 - filters the first thing we're checking
05:50 - for all these filters is to make sure
05:51 - they're not equal to their default value
05:53 - if they're not equal to their default
05:55 - value then we'll actually check if this
05:56 - filter applies to the object that we are
05:59 - on
05:59 - and if it does not then that means we'll
06:01 - continue we'll skip this
06:02 - item because only if we get down here to
06:04 - the very bottom do we actually
06:06 - push this item into the filtered data so
06:08 - it has to pass
06:09 - all four of these checks before it gets
06:11 - in if any one of these checks does not
06:13 - come up true
06:13 - or i guess in this case does come up
06:15 - true because we're doing it in kind of
06:16 - the opposite
06:17 - that means we won't add this item into
06:19 - the filtered data
06:20 - okay so that should theoretically work
06:22 - and that's really all we actually need
06:23 - to do to get this to work
06:25 - so let me just see if my website is
06:27 - running i believe it is okay let me
06:28 - refresh here
06:29 - let's add an item and let's see if we
06:30 - can filter it so we'll say name tim
06:32 - price 499 type person
06:36 - brand great okay so add it in add item
06:39 - and for some reason it didn't show up
06:41 - okay so i think we're gonna have we're
06:42 - having a problem sorry here
06:44 - uh with our filter data function because
06:46 - that's the only thing that could make
06:47 - this
06:48 - not work so let me have a quick look
06:49 - here and see what's going wrong and then
06:50 - i'll be right back
06:51 - all right so we will continue in one
06:53 - second we need to quickly thank the
06:54 - sponsor of this video and the series
06:56 - which is algo
06:57 - expert algo expert is the best platform
06:59 - to use from preparing for your software
07:00 - engineering interviews they have algo
07:02 - expert the product that i've been
07:03 - talking about this whole time
07:05 - they also have systems expert to help
07:06 - you prepare for your systems design
07:08 - interviews and now they have machine
07:10 - learning expert
07:11 - check them out from the link in the
07:12 - description and use the discount code
07:14 - tech with tim for a discount on the
07:15 - platform
07:16 - all right so i was just doing some
07:17 - debugging here you can see i'm just
07:19 - printing out what the filters are and i
07:20 - have
07:21 - found the errors let me refresh and show
07:22 - you actually how i came about finding
07:24 - this error because i think this is
07:25 - useful
07:26 - so if you can look here in the console
07:29 - when i press
07:30 - let's say add item here you can see that
07:33 - we're calling
07:35 - this filters function right and so we're
07:37 - going to console.log the filters now
07:38 - that's what's being printed right here
07:40 - this is the filters notice how this is
07:42 - an empty object
07:43 - now the reason this is an empty object
07:45 - is because i haven't pressed search yet
07:47 - when i press search notice this changes
07:49 - now it says name
07:50 - brand and then it shows this kind of
07:51 - empty object right that i have
07:53 - so the reason why we were getting this
07:55 - error where it wasn't showing us that
07:56 - item is because by default
07:58 - the state here is holding just an empty
08:00 - object that has no keys
08:02 - and so when i go inside of here
08:04 - filters.name is not equal to an empty
08:06 - string it's undefined
08:08 - an undefined is not equal to an empty
08:10 - string and so we immediately skipped our
08:13 - item
08:14 - hopefully that's clear but since we
08:15 - didn't have any filters
08:17 - this just broke it didn't work the way
08:18 - that we wanted to and so what we'll do
08:20 - inside of here for filter data
08:22 - is we'll just have one line here we'll
08:24 - say if
08:26 - filters is equal to an object like that
08:30 - then what we can do is we can just
08:31 - return our data again because if we
08:33 - don't have any filters there's nothing
08:34 - that we need to filter
08:36 - so now if i go here and again sorry so
08:38 - you can see that i don't want to go too
08:39 - quickly for you guys
08:40 - and i just refresh this let's add an
08:42 - item so let's say name
08:43 - 299 person test okay
08:47 - add item and of course it's not showing
08:50 - up
08:50 - okay that's interesting okay so it turns
08:52 - out that this line actually doesn't work
08:54 - i'm assuming that you simply cannot
08:55 - compare an empty object
08:57 - to another empty object and get true in
08:59 - javascript
09:00 - maybe i'm wrong on that but i'm pretty
09:02 - sure that this comparison is just
09:03 - invalid this just doesn't work we can't
09:04 - do that
09:05 - and so instead what i'm going to do here
09:07 - is i'm going to check if we have the
09:08 - name
09:09 - property in our filters so if we do not
09:12 - have the name
09:13 - property in our filters that means that
09:15 - we haven't yet filtered anything because
09:16 - we will always get a name that's
09:18 - going to be one of our filters we'll
09:20 - always have one of those and so in that
09:21 - case we can just return data
09:23 - so let's do that and let's see if this
09:24 - works now i'm going to go here okay and
09:26 - now this is working it's actually
09:27 - showing the correct items
09:29 - so let me just refresh this and let's
09:30 - restart so let's add a new
09:32 - an item tim 299 type
09:35 - person brand test okay so let's add item
09:38 - and now this is working it's showing up
09:41 - and now let's try to filter it so let's
09:42 - make the name
09:43 - tim and let's search and okay that works
09:46 - but if we change the type to say
09:48 - not a person and now we search notice it
09:50 - goes away
09:51 - right but if i remove this and now i
09:53 - press search
09:54 - it shows up again because now this
09:56 - reaches the filter but if i change this
09:58 - to 399
09:59 - uh this is still working okay oh it's
10:02 - because max price is above
10:03 - what it should be uh okay let's make
10:06 - this lower so let's make this
10:07 - 2 90 and search and then it goes away
10:10 - okay that makes sense
10:12 - all right so the filtering is now
10:13 - working now let's add another item in
10:15 - here
10:15 - we'll just make this one tim again price
10:17 - will be 5.99
10:20 - type person brand test add
10:23 - item okay now we'll press this to filter
10:26 - okay so max price 290 of course is not
10:28 - showing up now if we go
10:29 - three dollars and search we get this
10:32 - item but what if we go to
10:34 - 5.99 search okay it is showing up now
10:37 - let's filter by the brand test okay
10:39 - still showing up and there you go
10:41 - everything is indeed working
10:42 - all right so the filters are working
10:44 - again let's just have a look at this
10:45 - function this is really the meat of what
10:47 - we've done here
10:48 - we said filter data we're taking in some
10:49 - data we're defining our empty list this
10:52 - is what we'll return
10:53 - with our filtered data we're checking if
10:55 - we've called this
10:56 - or if we set our filters already if
10:59 - we've not set our filters and it's equal
11:00 - to an
11:01 - empty object like this so we do not have
11:03 - this name key
11:04 - that means we can just return the same
11:05 - data there's no filtering that we need
11:07 - to do
11:08 - otherwise we get a loop through all of
11:09 - our data here and then we're going to
11:12 - check all of the following things right
11:13 - and i've already walked through this so
11:14 - i won't walk through it again
11:16 - okay so that is really all we need to do
11:18 - to get the filtering working
11:19 - hopefully that was helpful there is a
11:21 - way to do this using the dot
11:22 - filter command or i guess syntax method
11:26 - function whatever you want to call it
11:28 - but i think it's always helpful to write
11:29 - out manually just so you understand
11:30 - exactly
11:31 - how you would do this if you weren't
11:32 - allowed to use something like
11:34 - dot filter all right so hopefully you
11:36 - guys enjoyed this video if you did make
11:37 - sure to leave a like
11:38 - subscribe to the channel and i will see
11:39 - you in the next one
