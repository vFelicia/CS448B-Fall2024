00:00 - now if you guys have learned the basic
00:01 - of the Python language you've done those
00:03 - hello world applications and you're now
00:05 - ready to move on to some more
00:06 - intermediate programming projects
00:08 - today's video is for you I'm Lea showing
00:11 - you five intermediate Python projects
00:13 - that not only are really usable you can
00:15 - actually deploy into the real world but
00:17 - also will help you build a skillset and
00:19 - a little bit of a resume for yourself as
00:20 - you start to progress and get better in
00:22 - this programming field now the main goal
00:24 - of this video is to introduce you to a
00:26 - lot of different things you can do with
00:28 - the Python language because it is almost
00:30 - unlimited once you get past those basics
00:33 - and you kind of learn the syntax and how
00:34 - the language works so with that being
00:36 - said I hope you guys enjoyed the video
00:37 - and before we get into it just a quick
00:39 - word from our sponsor before we get
00:41 - started I need to get a massive thank
00:42 - you to the node for sponsoring this
00:43 - video they make it easy and affordable
00:45 - to host your site or service in the
00:46 - cloud offering no nonsense hosting with
00:49 - plans starting at just $5 this means no
00:51 - surprise fees or overages like you might
00:53 - have gotten from some more entry-level
00:54 - hosting companies now the note else was
00:56 - a full API that works with tools like
00:58 - tariff wan and kubernetes making an
01:00 - awesome environment for development
01:02 - projects maybe you've used an entry
01:03 - level hosting service before well a
01:05 - notice you step up to powerful fast and
01:08 - fully configurable cloud computing
01:09 - anyways go ahead and sign up with the
01:11 - link below and take advantage of a free
01:13 - $20 credit using the code twt 19 so the
01:17 - first kind of project I recommend to
01:19 - intermediates is building a website
01:20 - using Python now this is going to
01:23 - involve you learning one of two
01:24 - molecules usually which is either Django
01:26 - or flask now these can be complicated
01:29 - modules but to learn them would probably
01:31 - take you a few hours and you'll be able
01:33 - to create a full website using almost
01:35 - entirely Python now there is some HTML
01:38 - that you might have to learn and write
01:39 - to actually display the web page but if
01:41 - you know Python this language is super
01:43 - easy to pick up you can do it in about
01:45 - five or ten minutes and being able to
01:47 - create a website with Python is very
01:48 - powerful a module like Django is
01:51 - actually used by applications like
01:52 - Instagram and tinder and people are
01:55 - hiring Django developers consistently so
01:57 - getting started with text technology as
01:59 - an intermediate is a great idea and you
02:01 - might just find that you really like
02:03 - doing this so that's why I'm
02:04 - recommending it to you here you can even
02:06 - try to create you know a resume website
02:08 - for yourself if you're thinking of
02:09 - something simple just a one-pager that
02:12 - kind of goes through you know
02:13 - maybe some of your skills some things
02:15 - that you've done and that's a great way
02:16 - to get started another thing you can do
02:18 - is try to turn one of your text based
02:20 - applications into a django website where
02:22 - essentially all you do is you take that
02:24 - kind of back-end you've created you
02:26 - bring it into django and then you
02:27 - display it nicely on a web based
02:29 - application now the second project I
02:31 - recommend for intermediates is building
02:33 - some kind of web scraper now essentially
02:36 - what a web scraper is is just grabbing
02:38 - information from a website or some kind
02:40 - of web page doing something with it
02:42 - maybe displaying in a nice way or
02:44 - manipulating information whatever it is
02:47 - that you want to do now a module that
02:48 - you can use to actually do web scraping
02:50 - and grab the information from a website
02:52 - is called beautifulsoup
02:54 - it's very easy to learn it's super
02:56 - simple and there's tons of tutorials on
02:58 - it online there's also some other web
02:59 - scraper modules out there that I'm sure
03:01 - you guys know one would work fine and
03:03 - I'd love to hear them in the comments
03:04 - down below if you want to recommend
03:06 - those to anyone but essentially some
03:07 - project ideas I've seen floating around
03:09 - on YouTube is something like creating a
03:11 - web screamer to keep track of Amazon
03:13 - prices so maybe to alert you when an
03:15 - item that you're looking for goes below
03:17 - market value similar with stocks people
03:20 - will keep track of stock prices and
03:22 - maybe do some kind of analysis on that
03:23 - you do something simple just like
03:25 - downloading all of your tweets and
03:27 - seeing you know how long is your average
03:29 - tweet whatever it is that you want to do
03:30 - you can probably do it with a web
03:32 - scraper and I'm sure you guys can get
03:33 - creative here and think of some cool
03:35 - ideas that you can do nice thing with
03:37 - this is it usually doesn't take very
03:38 - long to make these projects and you can
03:40 - kind of bang out a few of them in a few
03:41 - hours it's nice to kind of see how these
03:44 - work and just experiment with web
03:46 - scraping in general now my next entry on
03:48 - this list is creating a game using PI
03:51 - game now PI game is a 2d graphics
03:53 - library in Python that allows you to
03:56 - create games that are usually pretty
03:58 - simple now I've created all kinds of
04:00 - games using this module so I'm a little
04:02 - bit biased here when I tell you about
04:03 - this but I've made things like Tetris
04:05 - snake flappy bird a mini-golf game I've
04:08 - created all kinds of just graphical user
04:10 - interfaces and I actually use it to do
04:12 - very basic data visualization or to
04:15 - print out you know some models or
04:18 - physics simulations and stuff like that
04:19 - now this is a great module if you're
04:21 - looking for something fun to do maybe
04:23 - you want to take a weekend and build a
04:24 - game then I definitely recommend it
04:26 - actually have some tutorials on my
04:28 - channel using PI game and some full
04:29 - guides on how to create things like
04:31 - flappy bird with the multiple PI game
04:34 - now if you're not really interested in
04:36 - creating a game this is also good to
04:37 - learn because you can just do some basic
04:39 - drawing and if you want to do some
04:41 - physics simulations or some things with
04:43 - Python then you can definitely use PI
04:44 - game to do it and you don't have to get
04:45 - into OpenGL and all of that stuff now
04:47 - the next kind of projects I recommend
04:49 - are building a GUI which stands for
04:51 - graphical user interface using the
04:53 - module tkinter or PI QT 5 now if you're
04:56 - serious about gooeys just go right into
04:58 - PI QT 5 because there's more powerful
05:00 - framework but to Kinder's a little bit
05:02 - easier to learn and you can still create
05:03 - some applications with that but anyways
05:06 - if you're stuck on what kind of GUI to
05:08 - build what I usually recommend is taking
05:10 - some of your text based applications so
05:12 - maybe you've done a login system maybe
05:14 - you've done something that keeps track
05:15 - of inventory or keeps track of your
05:16 - expenses and turning that into a GUI now
05:19 - this is great because it makes you think
05:21 - about some of the different aspects that
05:22 - you need for the user like maybe you
05:24 - need a submit button maybe need some way
05:25 - to enter information and then once you
05:28 - start doing this you can even start
05:29 - looking into something like databases to
05:31 - keep track of the information now if
05:33 - you're thinking for some just quick
05:34 - ideas for gooeys what I usually
05:36 - recommend is login system I know this
05:38 - isn't gonna be secured with hashing and
05:40 - all that but just to kind of test out
05:42 - the waters and see how to do something
05:43 - like that as well as something that
05:45 - keeps track of your expenses maybe a
05:47 - to-do list there's all kinds of things
05:49 - that you can do and those are some
05:50 - pretty quick ideas and you can probably
05:52 - learn how to use this module in just a
05:54 - few hours alright so my last kind of
05:56 - project idea is doing something with
05:58 - robotics or with raspberry PI's now I've
06:01 - had my fair share of raspberry PI's and
06:03 - think I've had 3 of them now and it's
06:05 - always something fun to sit down with on
06:06 - a weekend or for a few hours and mess
06:08 - with some wiring and some electronics
06:10 - now some people don't like this they
06:12 - don't like messing with breadboards
06:13 - which is what I have right here but I
06:15 - think it's fun and once in a while it's
06:16 - nice to kind of get in to see some
06:18 - physical applications that can be run
06:20 - with Python now if you don't know
06:22 - Raspberry Pi runs its own operating
06:24 - system you can pick these up for like
06:26 - $35 and it mainly uses Python to program
06:29 - on it has all these pins that are
06:31 - connected to this kind of black jumper
06:33 - wire here what you can do is you can
06:35 - trigger them with Python code to turn on
06:37 - like LEDs to connect to sensors do all
06:40 - kinds of stuff and some projects that
06:41 - I've done with this is create like
06:42 - little safes where you know you have to
06:44 - type in a PIN code or you have to on the
06:47 - computer and then it'll open up the safe
06:48 - I've done a security system where it
06:50 - runs facial recognition to open up the
06:52 - door that's a little bit more advanced
06:53 - but just to give you an idea people
06:55 - create robots with them they create
06:56 - drones there's all kinds of stuff you
06:58 - can do and if you're into electronics
07:00 - then picking up one of these is
07:01 - definitely a good investment and you'll
07:03 - definitely get your money's worth out of
07:05 - it
07:05 - now to wrap up this video I want to
07:07 - quickly say that it's super important
07:08 - that you guys are working on projects I
07:10 - know you guys have watched this video to
07:12 - get some inspiration I hope I've given
07:14 - that to you but something that's gonna
07:15 - set you apart from other programmers is
07:17 - being able to work on projects
07:19 - independently a lot of people don't do
07:21 - this they just follow through on
07:22 - tutorials and do slight tweaks of them
07:24 - but what I always recommend is get the
07:26 - knowledge from the tutorials and then go
07:28 - off and try to do something on your own
07:30 - so with that being said I hope you guys
07:32 - got some projects ideas here I'd love to
07:34 - hear what you've worked on in the
07:35 - comments down below and if you enjoyed
07:37 - the video please make sure you hit that
07:39 - like button and subscribe to the channel
07:40 - to see other kind of projects that I'm
07:42 - gonna be working on in the future so
07:44 - with that being said thank you guys for
07:46 - watching and I will see you in another
07:47 - YouTube
