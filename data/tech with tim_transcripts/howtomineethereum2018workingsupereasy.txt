00:00 - hey guys welcome back to another youtube
00:02 - video in today's video I'm just gonna be
00:04 - going over how to mine aetherium in 2018
00:07 - so I do already have a video on my
00:09 - channel entitled how to mine aetherium
00:11 - for beginners now if you haven't watched
00:13 - that video yet you might want to go
00:14 - check that one out first because a lot
00:16 - of the stuff I'm gonna be referencing in
00:17 - this is gonna be in relation to that as
00:19 - this is kind of a update video for that
00:21 - and for the people that are still
00:22 - watching that video I'm trying to
00:24 - redirect them to this one so that they
00:26 - can see the new method on how to do this
00:30 - now I'm not gonna go over everything I
00:32 - go over in that video is that ones 10
00:34 - minutes long this is just a quick update
00:35 - and a quick fix for people that are
00:37 - having issues Mining aetherium and this
00:39 - hopefully should fix those issues so
00:41 - pretty much in my other video I had a
00:45 - lot of comments saying this isn't
00:46 - working I can't have my antivirus isn't
00:49 - letting me download the program and just
00:51 - a ton of different issues that to be
00:52 - honest I don't have all the answers to
00:54 - so what I decided to do was upload my
00:57 - working miner file on to the github here
01:00 - that you can see on my screen where you
01:02 - guys are gonna be able to download it
01:03 - and simply change a few little things
01:05 - and hopefully be able to get mining so
01:08 - what you need to do the first step here
01:11 - is just gonna be to go to the github
01:13 - that I've posted my miner files on so
01:15 - this is pretty much just github calm
01:17 - slash tech with Tim slash download miner
01:19 - now if you're too lazy to type that in
01:21 - I'm gonna put it down in description so
01:22 - you can just click it and once you're on
01:24 - here you're just gonna click on
01:25 - claymores miner dot zip like that and
01:28 - then you're gonna click on download like
01:30 - so now it should download and this
01:33 - should hopefully surpass your antivirus
01:36 - so I tried this on Google Drive first
01:38 - and what kept happening is when I tried
01:40 - to download it it would say there's an
01:42 - anti-virus it's not letting me it won't
01:45 - let me download this there's a virus in
01:46 - the file as I'm saying here there's no
01:49 - virus in this file take I mean don't
01:52 - download it if you don't want to but
01:54 - this works for me and I'm gonna show you
01:56 - me running the file on my own program or
01:58 - on my own computer so you can see but
02:01 - yeah just download that and then go
02:03 - ahead and open it up so just double
02:05 - click it I'm using WinRAR if you have
02:07 - another unzipping file that works you
02:10 - might be able to do it without having
02:11 - WinRAR but I'm not sure
02:13 - it says you can't unzip this file then
02:15 - just go ahead and download winrar it's
02:16 - free and you can just get it on the
02:18 - internet so then once you've done that
02:19 - you're gonna grab this folder that I
02:21 - have in here called claymores dual a
02:22 - theory of miner and you're gonna drag it
02:24 - onto your desktop or wherever you want
02:26 - to store it once you've done that you
02:28 - can close your window R and then you can
02:30 - open up the folder now you can see
02:32 - there's a ton of different files in here
02:34 - but the one we're gonna want to be
02:34 - looking at is this ether mind dot bat
02:37 - file now the reason I named it this is
02:39 - because this is the pool that I'm using
02:41 - to mine with ether mind if you want to
02:43 - use a different pool then you're gonna
02:45 - have to watch a different video because
02:47 - ether mine is the pool that we're gonna
02:49 - be using for this so you're gonna double
02:51 - click on this file just to make sure
02:52 - that everything is working and you can
02:54 - see it should pop up with your graphics
02:57 - card and it should start mining now I'm
03:00 - just gonna close this because I'm gonna
03:01 - show you a little tweak we have to do
03:02 - first but yeah you can see that
03:05 - everything is working there now what I'm
03:07 - gonna do here is I'm gonna click on edit
03:09 - and then in here you can see these are
03:12 - my settings so pretty much we have the e
03:15 - pool which I'm using the EU servers you
03:17 - may want to change this to North
03:18 - American or Asia depending on where you
03:20 - live and then the e-wallet so this is
03:23 - the one that you're gonna have to change
03:24 - unless you want to be sending me all of
03:26 - your mind
03:27 - ethereal so this is my current aetherium
03:30 - mining address or aetherium wallet sorry
03:32 - so what you're gonna want to do is make
03:34 - sure you have in if you're in wallet
03:36 - created if you don't already know how to
03:37 - do that or you don't have one created
03:39 - click on the card then I'm gonna put in
03:40 - the top right of the screen right here
03:42 - and it'll just show you how to make an
03:43 - aetherium wallet it's pretty easy and
03:45 - pretty simple so once you've done that
03:47 - you're gonna use your public address or
03:49 - your public key in here and then you
03:52 - might want to change this name as well
03:54 - because this identifies your miner so if
03:56 - you have multiple miners you might want
03:58 - just wanted to find the location I just
03:59 - named mine Tim because that's my name
04:01 - and then once you're done that you're
04:03 - gonna click ctrl s to save your progress
04:04 - and you're going to close this ok so
04:08 - after that you're pretty much done all
04:11 - you have to do is double click this file
04:12 - and you should be off to the races and
04:15 - started mining now again I didn't go
04:18 - through everything as much or as in
04:20 - detail as I did in the other video this
04:23 - one is just a quick fix for people that
04:24 - are having trouble mining or the
04:26 - people that are watching my old my older
04:28 - video and that method isn't quite
04:30 - working for them so again let me know in
04:32 - the comments below if this method is
04:34 - working there may be some issues with it
04:37 - you may not be able to download some of
04:39 - this stuff but from what I've seen so
04:41 - far and from what I've tested this
04:42 - should hopefully be working if you have
04:44 - any questions leave them down below I'll
04:46 - try to respond to you and if this helped
04:48 - you out please help me by leaving a like
04:50 - and a subscribe thanks and I'll see you
