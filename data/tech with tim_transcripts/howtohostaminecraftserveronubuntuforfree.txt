00:00 - hello everyone and welcome back so in
00:02 - this video what I'm redoing is showing
00:03 - you how to host a minecraft server on a
00:05 - bun to Linux and specifically for free
00:07 - for at least your first four months now
00:10 - that's thank to thanks to the node for
00:11 - sponsoring this video they're giving us
00:13 - a free $20 credit towards our servers
00:16 - whenever we sign up here so you guys
00:18 - will actually be able to run this for 4
00:19 - months for free using those basic plan
00:22 - on the node now I know you're like well
00:23 - how am I gonna run a massive minecraft
00:25 - server what I would recommend you guys
00:27 - do is just get your minecraft server set
00:29 - up on the cheapest plan get everything
00:31 - working and then you can always transfer
00:33 - over the world the plugins and
00:34 - everything else to a different server
00:36 - once you've done that so if you just
00:37 - want to mess with it and you know kind
00:39 - of do some administrative stuff this is
00:40 - a good way to do that to start so you
00:42 - can sign up there's a link below or you
00:44 - can also just use this code twt 19 and
00:46 - that will give you $20 off on the node
00:48 - now let's kind of go through the steps
00:50 - here that we're gonna need to take but
00:51 - before I do that I just need to make a
00:53 - really quick announcement I am thinking
00:55 - about hosting a minecraft server for the
00:57 - tech with Tim community you guys are
00:58 - interested in that please let me know in
01:00 - the comments down below I'm only gonna
01:01 - do it if I have enough interest I also
01:03 - don't know what game-mode to make it so
01:05 - you know if you have an idea like
01:06 - factions creative whatever that is leave
01:08 - a comment ok so the first step that we
01:10 - need to do is on our host computer so
01:13 - not actually the one that we're gonna be
01:15 - running the minecraft server on we need
01:16 - to download this minecraft server jar
01:18 - now I would say just download this on a
01:21 - bun - you can do that if you have a web
01:23 - browser on your bunting machine and you
01:25 - can get to this minecraft page and I'll
01:27 - again there'll be a link down below but
01:28 - this is just a minecraft server jar it's
01:30 - from The Minecraft website you need to I
01:33 - believe actually I don't think you need
01:34 - to be logged in to do this because I'm
01:35 - not logged in right now but anyways
01:37 - download that jar and we're gonna
01:38 - transfer it over to our server once we
01:41 - get to that point now the next thing we
01:43 - need to do is download putty now this is
01:44 - an SSH client there actually is a
01:46 - built-in SSH client for the node but it
01:50 - is kind of buggy and this just works a
01:51 - bit better so that's why we're gonna use
01:52 - this so you know we can download putty
01:54 - by clicking this already a bit
01:55 - downloaded again link in the description
01:57 - we also need win SCP although you don't
02:00 - need to use this specific woman you just
02:01 - need some kind of file transfer software
02:03 - like FileZilla where you can transfer
02:05 - things to your server so download this
02:06 - there's link in the description okay so
02:09 - now that we've done that we need to
02:10 - setup our server so if you have your own
02:12 - a bunch of machine your going
02:13 - hosting this you know like you have
02:15 - access to that machine like the physical
02:17 - device then you don't need to follow
02:18 - this specific step but if you don't then
02:20 - follow along with me what I'm gonna do
02:22 - is create a new lanoline DUP here click
02:25 - that link and what I'm gonna do is
02:26 - choose my distribution as a bun to 18
02:29 - point 0.4 um I would recommend you do
02:31 - anything at this level or above it to
02:34 - guarantee this tutorial is gonna work
02:35 - for you and then for my plan onla note
02:37 - you can pick between all of these and if
02:39 - you want to run a four gig server for
02:41 - one month for free you have that $20
02:42 - credits you can do that but I'm just
02:44 - gonna pick this nano twitch is the
02:45 - cheapest one it's $5 a month and then
02:48 - what I'm gonna do here is give a name to
02:49 - my server and I'm gonna call it tutorial
02:52 - now I also need to pick the region which
02:54 - is up here I'm gonna pick Toronto
02:56 - Ontario is that's what I'm closest to
02:57 - the you guys can pick through here these
02:59 - are just the different regions the note
03:01 - has now what I'm gonna do is actually
03:03 - enter a root password here this is how
03:05 - we're gonna login to our server so make
03:07 - sure this this is secure and you
03:09 - remember the password and then other
03:11 - than that I think we're actually good to
03:13 - go now I will show you quickly here that
03:16 - this is actually really cool the node
03:17 - has a one click option for minecraft
03:19 - servers so if you click one click up
03:21 - here you can actually just click
03:22 - minecraft latest and if you do this
03:25 - it'll select you can go through all
03:27 - these settings and select and create a
03:28 - minecraft server the only issue with
03:30 - this is it creates a completely vanilla
03:32 - minecraft server and you can't what do
03:36 - you call it like modify it from the
03:37 - console it's just really difficult to
03:39 - work with but all you want is like a
03:40 - vanilla minecraft server then just do
03:42 - the one-click minecraft and that'll do
03:44 - it for you ok so I realize clicking that
03:46 - that cleared my thing anyways I just
03:47 - filled this back in now what we're gonna
03:48 - do is click create to once we're done
03:50 - this will take a second to boot up the
03:53 - node and get started if you chose the
03:54 - one-click option this is gonna take you
03:57 - probably like five to ten minutes
03:58 - because that's to actually create the
04:00 - minecraft server for you but once this
04:01 - is done we'll be right back and we'll
04:02 - move on with the next steps alright so
04:04 - now that we've booted up here we're
04:05 - ready to grab the IP address of the
04:07 - server and connect to it so to do that
04:09 - what we're gonna do is go to networking
04:10 - tab here we're gonna look for this ipv4
04:13 - tab and then this address right here so
04:15 - mine is one 72.1 oh five to one dot one
04:18 - to nine now don't give this to people
04:20 - unless they're gonna be connecting to
04:21 - your minecraft server but anyways I'm
04:23 - gonna be deleting this after so it's not
04:25 - really a huge deal
04:26 - so anyways that's our address we need
04:28 - that I'm gonna copy that address onto my
04:30 - clipboard and I'll show you quickly that
04:31 - if you want to SSH into the server
04:33 - really quickly what you can use is just
04:35 - this launch console tab here
04:37 - specifically from Berlin ode and it will
04:39 - bring up this right here so you can see
04:41 - it's actually just running through some
04:42 - server commands but this is the SSH that
04:45 - it has again I'm not gonna be using that
04:47 - just because putty is a little bit
04:48 - easier to work with and it's nice to
04:50 - learn how to use it because you can use
04:51 - that for any server so what I'm gonna do
04:53 - is open putty now I'm assuming you guys
04:55 - have downloaded this I'll zoom in here
04:57 - so you guys can see but what I'm gonna
04:58 - do is connect to the server so I have
05:01 - that address here so I'm gonna put that
05:02 - as the host name or IP address I'm gonna
05:04 - leave this port as 22 and what I'm gonna
05:07 - do is actually save a new session in
05:09 - putty so that I don't have to type this
05:11 - IP address in every time so what I'm
05:12 - gonna do is just save this as minecraft
05:15 - server tutorial you can see I have a few
05:19 - things up here already and I'm gonna
05:21 - click Save now when I do that it's gonna
05:23 - save this profile so it's gonna save
05:25 - this port name and this host IP into
05:27 - putty and I'm just gonna do one more
05:28 - thing because I want to make it the font
05:30 - a little bit bigger here so you guys can
05:31 - read it I'm gonna change my font size to
05:33 - 26 and I'm gonna go back to logging now
05:36 - our session sorry and just save one more
05:38 - time to minecraft server tutorial so now
05:41 - every time I run this my font size will
05:43 - be 26 and we'll be able to see that from
05:45 - the console so once we do that we're
05:47 - gonna click open you can see it's gonna
05:49 - bring up this kind of message just click
05:50 - yes everything's fine there when we log
05:52 - in we're gonna log in as the root user
05:54 - on a bun too and we're gonna put the
05:56 - password as whatever that root password
05:58 - is that you guys typed in when you
06:00 - created your server now this will take a
06:02 - second but once we get in here we should
06:05 - see this kind of screen popping up and
06:07 - now we're actually gonna get to starting
06:09 - to work on the minecraft server so what
06:11 - I'm gonna do is just change directory
06:13 - back into the home directory so I'm
06:15 - gonna CD dot dot on a hit LS here and
06:19 - now what I can do is choose where I want
06:20 - to put my minecraft server so I can put
06:23 - it in the root directory or the home
06:24 - directory it doesn't really matter but
06:26 - what I'm gonna do is change directories
06:28 - into my home directory so CD home and
06:30 - when I do that it'll bring me into home
06:32 - and now what I'm going to do is create a
06:34 - new folder so I'm gonna say m'kay der
06:36 - which stands for make directory
06:38 - and I'm gonna call this minecraft this
06:41 - is where I'm gonna store all of the
06:42 - Minecraft files that I need so now what
06:44 - I'm gonna do is CD into minecraft like
06:47 - that and just I can type LS and you can
06:49 - see there's nothing in this directory
06:51 - okay so now that we've done that what we
06:53 - need to do is transfer over the
06:55 - minecraft server jar to this and put it
06:58 - inside of that folder and this is where
07:00 - when SCP comes in so I'm gonna open win
07:03 - SCP here and this is just a file
07:05 - transfer client right so you guys can
07:07 - you know use whatever one you want but
07:09 - this is the one for this tutorial and
07:10 - what I'm gonna do where it says new site
07:12 - is I'm gonna put in the host name of our
07:15 - server which is just simply the IP
07:16 - address on port number 22 I'm gonna put
07:19 - the user name as root and the password
07:21 - as that password and I believe this
07:24 - blocks it out so I can type it in okay
07:25 - now we will hit save and we can save
07:28 - this as just the IP address or you can
07:30 - call it you know minecraft server or
07:31 - whatever you want I'll just save it as
07:32 - the IP address and then go ahead and
07:34 - click login it'll probably give you this
07:36 - message just click yes and then you can
07:38 - type in that root password one more time
07:40 - should be able to gain access to the
07:43 - server and now we can just kind of look
07:45 - through the file structure of our bond
07:47 - to server so you can see it starts us in
07:49 - the root directory but we can go back by
07:51 - just clicking up here you know we have
07:53 - all these directories and we can go into
07:55 - home now home is where we have this
07:57 - minecraft folder so we go there we have
07:59 - minecraft and now what we're gonna do is
08:01 - find that minecraft server jar from our
08:03 - computer and drag it on to here so mine
08:06 - is in downloads I'm just gonna find it
08:08 - on my other screen here cuz I have a few
08:11 - things so I'm gonna take this server
08:12 - file I'm not sure if you can see my
08:14 - mouse button and just drag it in here so
08:16 - I had it in my download so I just took
08:18 - it and just dragged it in and we're good
08:20 - to go now
08:21 - now this will take a second to transfer
08:22 - over once this is done I'll continue
08:24 - with the tutorial we'll keep going okay
08:26 - so now we have this server jar file on
08:28 - our minecraft server and we are actually
08:31 - good to just close this win SCP because
08:33 - we don't need this anymore
08:34 - now I will quickly say though the reason
08:36 - I got you guys to download this as well
08:37 - is well obviously to transfer this over
08:39 - but you can use this to back up your
08:41 - world so if you want to make backups of
08:43 - your Minecraft world what you can do is
08:45 - just log in here take that world file in
08:48 - the world directory and just drag it on
08:49 - to your home computer and then that way
08:51 - you have a backup
08:52 - on another computer in case anything
08:53 - happens with your server okay so I'm
08:56 - gonna close this and now we should still
08:58 - be logged in in this root panel now so
09:00 - if I click LS now in here you should see
09:02 - we have this server jar file so now what
09:05 - we need to do is actually create a
09:06 - script to run the server jar file now
09:09 - this is on the minecraft website they
09:11 - actually have the exact script to run
09:12 - here so I'm just gonna take this and
09:14 - copy this so it's Java
09:16 - - xmx 1,024 what I would or whatever
09:19 - whatever and it says minecraft server
09:21 - 1.1 point for jar no GUI but we're gonna
09:24 - need to change that to just say server
09:25 - jar because that's the name of the
09:27 - server we downloaded so I'll show you
09:29 - anyways how this works what we're gonna
09:31 - do is make a script that we can simply
09:32 - just run that will run the minecraft
09:35 - server so if we ever turn it off we
09:36 - don't need to type that in it can just
09:38 - run it for us so what I'm gonna do is
09:40 - type in Nano and I'm gonna type Nano
09:42 - start underscore server dot Sh
09:46 - so we're gonna do Nano start underscore
09:48 - server sh now that we have that it
09:50 - should bring up this text editor what
09:52 - I'm gonna do is copy in that command
09:55 - that I copied so I copied that from my
09:57 - home computer and to copy it in here
09:58 - what I did is just right clicked on my
10:00 - mouse
10:01 - you can't hit control V that's not gonna
10:03 - work now what we need to do here is
10:05 - modify this a bit depending on what
10:07 - you're using so I'm gonna tell you what
10:09 - these arguments mean here so X MX and
10:11 - SMS stands for how much RAM you're
10:14 - allocating to your server and allocating
10:16 - just means like how much you're lettin
10:18 - it use now right now this is saying 1024
10:21 - megabytes of RAM is the minimum amount
10:23 - of RAM we'll use because that's X m/s
10:25 - and 1024 megabytes of RAM is the maximum
10:28 - amount we'll use so what you can do is
10:30 - if you have a server that has more than
10:32 - one gig of ram change this and bump this
10:35 - number up so if you have two gigs of ram
10:36 - then you would change this number to be
10:39 - 2048 and you can change the bottom half
10:42 - as well here to be 2048 now since we
10:44 - only have one gig of ram we can just
10:47 - give it all of that so 1024 1024 and
10:49 - then when it says minecraft server love
10:52 - of allah jar we just need to change this
10:54 - name to be whatever that server is that
10:56 - we dragged in now in our case our jar
10:59 - file is literally just called server jar
11:01 - so we'll do that and we should be good
11:03 - to go now so to save what we can do is
11:05 - simply
11:06 - hit ctrl X it will ask you if you want
11:08 - to save you can hit Y to save and then
11:10 - hit enter to save it as start underscore
11:12 - server SH okay so now that we've done
11:15 - that what we're gonna do is just run a
11:17 - quick update on our machine before we do
11:19 - anything else so just sudo apt - get
11:21 - update now that's just gonna update the
11:24 - machine for us and make sure we have the
11:25 - most recent version of everything you
11:26 - need and this could take a while
11:28 - depending on how old the server is that
11:30 - you're using so run that it'll take a
11:32 - second I'll be back when that's done
11:34 - alright so the next step is to make sure
11:35 - we have a Java installed now I think you
11:38 - can literally just type Java and you can
11:40 - see if you have it but this shows you
11:42 - the commands to install it so apt
11:44 - install open JDK 8 JRE headless so once
11:48 - you run the the installer which I'm
11:50 - going to show you in a second if for
11:53 - some reason that says like you don't
11:54 - have Java installed or that doesn't work
11:55 - you can run these commands so sudo apt
11:58 - install open JDK 8 JRE headless now what
12:01 - the headless means is if you don't have
12:02 - a monitor and keyboard physically
12:04 - attached to the machine that's the one
12:06 - you usually install so in this case we
12:08 - would install this one and then we
12:09 - should be good to go okay so small
12:11 - realisation I don't have Java on this
12:13 - machine I thought I did so if you type
12:15 - Java it tells you the exact command you
12:17 - need to install it so I'm just gonna
12:19 - copy this apt install so now that I've
12:22 - done that apt install open JDK 8 JRE
12:25 - headless it's gonna install Java it's
12:27 - gonna ask me if I want to install this
12:29 - I'll click Y free yes we'll go through
12:31 - the install and then once this is done
12:33 - I'll be back and we should have Java and
12:35 - be ready to go so now what I'm gonna do
12:37 - is actually run and make that file that
12:40 - we just created an executable so if we
12:42 - do LS we see we have two files now so
12:44 - start server SH and this is what we're
12:46 - gonna do to run the server so to make
12:48 - this an executable what I actually need
12:50 - to do is do chmod plus X and then do
12:54 - start server SH and hit enter okay my
13:00 - bad there so there's no so there's no
13:01 - space are there is a space in between
13:04 - chmod and + X I just didn't have there
13:06 - so I was confused anyway so chmod space
13:08 - plus X is H this will make this file an
13:12 - executable for us now for some reason it
13:14 - says like you don't permission to do
13:15 - this just type sudo before the command
13:17 - so chmod
13:18 - plus X and then start serve it on Sh and
13:22 - the reason how I'm getting that is I'm
13:23 - just hitting tab once I do st and it
13:25 - fills it in for me and what I will try
13:27 - to do is now run that executable file so
13:30 - LS again it's called start server dot SH
13:32 - so to run this we do dot slash start
13:35 - server dot SH and hit enter now if you
13:38 - don't get any output immediately just
13:40 - give it a second it takes a minute to
13:42 - load so here let's see what we actually
13:44 - just got now so this worked this ran I
13:47 - know it says failed to load properties
13:48 - from file server at our properties
13:50 - failed to load you load text you need to
13:52 - agree to the EULA in order around the
13:53 - server so what does this mean well a lot
13:55 - of people get stuck on this but what
13:56 - this does is just me you have to agree
13:58 - to like the terms and conditions before
13:59 - it lets you run this so if we hit LS now
14:02 - to list all the things you see we have
14:04 - some new files now we have server dot
14:06 - properties we have logs and we have ulla
14:08 - text or ever you say that so what we're
14:10 - gonna do is edit this EULA text again
14:13 - I'm butchering how you say that but
14:15 - we'll do Nano you got dot txt now what
14:18 - we're gonna do is literally just come in
14:19 - here and change this to say true so we
14:22 - say true and then ctrl X do you want to
14:24 - modify yes we hit Y hit enter okay now
14:28 - that we've done that what we can do is
14:30 - run the server again and now it should
14:32 - start generating the world and actually
14:34 - creating the spawn area now this will
14:36 - take a few minutes so I'm gonna
14:36 - fast-forward through it but once this is
14:39 - finished running I'll show you what it
14:40 - looks like alright so now the server is
14:42 - up and running we're actually in like
14:44 - the main console so the first thing I
14:46 - would ask tell you has to probably do is
14:48 - just op yourself so you're gonna op your
14:50 - username so just literally type in your
14:52 - user name - mr. hippo 9 I know
14:54 - interesting minecraft username anyways
14:56 - we'll do that op your user and then that
14:58 - way when you go on the server you can
15:00 - actually you know be an OP and do stuff
15:03 - so you might get these things so I can't
15:05 - keep up the server overloading it's
15:07 - running this may ticks behind that's
15:08 - just because we only have one gig of ram
15:10 - on the server it's fine
15:11 - to run like 1 or 2 people on the server
15:13 - at once you're gonna be running like a
15:15 - lot of people you need to have more RAM
15:17 - on your minecraft server but anyways for
15:19 - now that's fine okay so now our
15:21 - minecraft server is actually running
15:23 - which means we can connect to it so I'm
15:25 - gonna log into minecraft I'm gonna show
15:26 - you how we can connect but it's pretty
15:28 - much as simple as literally just taking
15:31 - this IPO
15:32 - so whatever one our server is and typing
15:34 - that in like the Direct Connect of
15:36 - Minecraft and just joining now make sure
15:38 - obviously when you launch minecraft
15:39 - you're in the right minecraft version
15:41 - but it'll tell you that if it's not
15:43 - working so I'm gonna launch minecraft
15:44 - log in and then show you guys I'll be
15:46 - right back alright so I'm here in
15:47 - minecraft now I'm in the direct connect
15:48 - window what I'm gonna do is just you
15:50 - know join the server now and show you
15:52 - that this does indeed work umm alright
15:55 - let's see here okay I am in the server
15:57 - and we can see that everything is
16:00 - working that's actually an interesting
16:02 - spawn point why I never
16:03 - I haven't played minecraft in a while
16:05 - there's a lot of new stuff I'm looking
16:07 - like in the sea here but anyways I'm a
16:09 - nob so that means I can do like /tp I
16:11 - can do slash op I can do all these
16:13 - commands I can do everything right so
16:16 - that is how that works and there we go
16:19 - we are in the minecraft server so I mean
16:21 - that's all good and nice I'm just gonna
16:22 - show you guys a few more things because
16:24 - I want to show you what happens if I
16:27 - close this so the way that we're running
16:29 - the minecraft server right now is this
16:31 - kind of the way that the way that we're
16:33 - running it is connected to our display
16:35 - which means that if I close this window
16:38 - the minecraft server will actually turn
16:39 - off so I'm going to show you how we can
16:41 - run this without turning the minecraft
16:43 - server off so first to quit the server I
16:45 - think I can just do quit or can I do
16:47 - like stop yes stop so to stop the server
16:50 - from here I'll do stop we'll give that a
16:52 - second it'll save the chunks all of that
16:54 - now if I want to run the server
16:56 - continuously regardless of if I have
16:58 - this computer on or not
17:00 - what I need to do is use something
17:01 - called screen so start by typing screen
17:03 - and seeing if that works for you most
17:06 - computers should come with screen but if
17:09 - for some reason you don't have it what
17:11 - you can do is to do sudo apt - get
17:14 - install screen and then that should
17:17 - install it for you so again I'll read
17:19 - through do all this and yeah anyways so
17:23 - what we're gonna do is just type screen
17:24 - and then we're gonna do dot slash start
17:27 - server SH so by running screen before
17:31 - this it will detach this process from
17:33 - our display which means that the
17:35 - minecraft server will run continuously
17:36 - and we'll just be able to connect to
17:38 - whatever so let's hit enter and you can
17:40 - see that it kind of gives us a little
17:41 - bit of a different look here now it gets
17:43 - rid of all that console stuff the
17:45 - we'll start running it will go the
17:47 - minecraft server will boot up and we
17:48 - will be good to go so that is kind of it
17:50 - for creating the minecraft server again
17:52 - I want to thank you say thank you to Lou
17:54 - node for sponsoring this video
17:55 - definitely take advantage of this $20
17:57 - credits the note is awesome they have a
17:59 - lot of support if you guys have any
18:00 - troubles with some of the stuff and
18:01 - setting some things up you can always
18:03 - contact the know they have a 24 hour
18:05 - support team and they will probably be
18:07 - able to help you at least guide you in
18:09 - the right direction on what to do now
18:10 - last thing here is well on low note is
18:13 - actually opening a new data center by
18:15 - the end of 2019 in Australia so if you
18:17 - guys are from Australia that's actually
18:19 - pretty exciting because typically they
18:20 - don't have like hosting companies and
18:22 - servers that have anything in Australia
18:25 - so that's a good way to take advantage
18:26 - of this and use it so anyways that has
18:28 - been it for how to create a Minecraft so
18:30 - if you guys enjoy please make sure you
18:31 - leave a like subscribe to the channel
18:33 - and let me know what type of minecraft
18:35 - server I should run for you guys in the
18:37 - future
