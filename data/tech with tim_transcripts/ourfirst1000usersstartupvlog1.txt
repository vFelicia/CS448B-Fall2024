00:03 - foreign
00:08 - a few days ago my tech started velocity
00:10 - released the first version of our mobile
00:12 - app which is now available on IOS and
00:15 - Android if you haven't already
00:16 - downloaded it you can do that from the
00:18 - link in the description and use the
00:19 - invite code Tech with Tim we're only
00:21 - going to be letting on a few hundred
00:22 - more people so if you want a chance to
00:24 - view the app before it gets to the next
00:26 - state and kind of when we're in our
00:27 - early release let's call it that then
00:29 - make sure you do that now regardless
00:31 - after announcing this on my YouTube
00:33 - channel we got a ton of feedback on the
00:35 - app we gained our first a thousand users
00:37 - and a bit more and now after being a few
00:39 - days past the release I wanted to share
00:41 - with you kind of some of the lessons
00:43 - that we've learned challenges that we've
00:44 - ran into problems that occurred and just
00:47 - tell you a bit about how the release
00:48 - went and kind of keep you guys updated
00:50 - this is something I want to continue to
00:52 - do on this channel talk to you guys
00:53 - about how the startup is going things
00:55 - that I've learned from a technical
00:56 - perspective also from a user perspective
00:58 - marketing business Etc hopefully you
01:01 - guys are looking forward to that with
01:02 - that said let's get into the video
01:07 - so in case any of you didn't see my
01:09 - original video that goes through the
01:10 - full walkthrough and demo of the app so
01:12 - feel free to check that out I'll throw
01:13 - it on the screen but now let me explain
01:15 - to you kind of what happened on release
01:17 - day so I posted a video at about noon my
01:20 - time now as soon as I posted the video
01:22 - it did pretty well immediately and
01:24 - within the first two hours we had a few
01:26 - hundred new users on our app now we got
01:28 - a ton of feedback during that time and
01:30 - we had a ton of issues and bugs that
01:31 - occurred now one of the most critical
01:33 - issues that occurred was there was an
01:35 - issue with our invite code system now
01:37 - this was an issue I had never seen
01:38 - before even when I tested with about a
01:40 - hundred other people on different IOS
01:42 - and Android devices but I think what
01:44 - happened was we had a bunch of people
01:46 - join at once which we've never had and
01:48 - it caused a little bit of latency on our
01:50 - back end which essentially resulted in
01:52 - people kind of being stuck on the invite
01:54 - code Redemption page so what they would
01:55 - do is redeem their invite code the app
01:57 - would tell them yes the invite code's
01:59 - all good but it wouldn't move them
02:00 - forward in the onboarding process and
02:02 - that's because of again a bit of latency
02:04 - between when we were assigning kind of a
02:06 - rule that allowed the user in an app and
02:09 - when the app was checking if they had
02:10 - that role so it was checking before that
02:12 - role was assigned so what I needed to do
02:15 - was very quickly and go on our back end
02:17 - do a little bit of a fix and essentially
02:19 - make it so the role was assigned earlier
02:21 - in the process so that they would then
02:22 - be able to join the app so maybe that
02:24 - makes a bit of sense but we lost
02:26 - probably about 100 users in the first
02:28 - few hours of my video being released
02:30 - because we had this bug that I couldn't
02:32 - fix or I didn't know about fortunately
02:34 - the bug was kind of self-correcting if
02:36 - you were to close the app and reopen it
02:37 - you were fine you would have got through
02:39 - but again something popped up completely
02:40 - unexpected and right at the beginning of
02:43 - our kind of user registration process
02:44 - which is the worst possible time for it
02:46 - to occur so I guess the lesson here is
02:49 - that anything that can go wrong is going
02:51 - to go wrong you kind of need to be
02:52 - prepared for that and I won't lie to you
02:54 - you know it's a bit stressful for me in
02:55 - those few hours kind of running around
02:57 - panicking making a bunch of YouTube
02:58 - comments and trying to figure out what
03:00 - this issue was so anyways that's kind of
03:02 - what happened at the beginning of the
03:03 - release and then as we continued
03:05 - throughout the day I was kind of
03:06 - monitoring all of the analysis looking
03:08 - at all of our different dashboards and
03:10 - overall everything was going okay
03:12 - obviously there was some bugs there was
03:14 - some minor issues some problems with
03:15 - some games there was a few people
03:17 - crashing in the app but this wasn't
03:18 - anything unexpected whenever you have a
03:21 - brand new app that you're rolling out to
03:22 - a bunch of people around the world on
03:24 - hundreds of different devices you're
03:25 - going to run into stuff like this that
03:27 - you just can't find in internal testing
03:29 - so I wasn't too stressed about that and
03:31 - as I kind of went through the day I
03:32 - started to realize that a lot of the
03:34 - weird bugs that were occurring were
03:36 - occurring on very very old Android
03:38 - devices so we had done a lot of testing
03:40 - on iOS and for the most part iOS was
03:42 - completely fine Android however is a
03:45 - little bit harder to test because just
03:47 - so many different devices and versions
03:49 - and what ended up happening was a ton of
03:51 - you guys I don't know why are on like
03:52 - Android 4 Android 5 Android 6 which are
03:55 - really really old versions of Android
03:57 - and you were having a lot of issues with
03:59 - the app that were causing you guys to
04:01 - crash so I guess kind of the lesson here
04:03 - was that we needed to make the minimum
04:05 - supported version for the app higher
04:07 - which which we didn't know in K until
04:09 - you guys started crashing with all these
04:10 - older versions of Android and the only
04:12 - way I was able to determine that was
04:14 - because I added a crashlytics we use
04:16 - Firebase so it's called crashlytics the
04:17 - package added like a crash monitoring
04:19 - software to the app that kind of gave us
04:21 - information about all the app devices
04:23 - all of the Android versions Etc so I was
04:26 - able to determine that anyone below a
04:28 - certain version of Android uh was just
04:30 - crashing in the app because they had an
04:31 - outdated kind of java SDK that's at
04:34 - least what I think the problem was so
04:36 - we've kind of fixed that now but again
04:38 - something that we didn't consider I
04:39 - didn't think that people were going to
04:41 - be on an Android version from 2015 or
04:43 - from 2014 or on a really really tiny
04:45 - Android device there's all kinds of
04:47 - weird bugs occurring there so we kind of
04:49 - had to mitigate that going forward so
04:51 - again lesson here you know you got to
04:53 - really consider that almost anyone can
04:55 - be using your app especially if you're
04:56 - going on a platform like Android and
04:58 - that's something that I didn't really
04:59 - think and that was kind of an oversight
05:01 - for me when I was doing the original
05:02 - development so continuing here the next
05:04 - thing I'll discuss is feedback now
05:06 - obviously feedback is super super
05:07 - important especially when you're in kind
05:09 - of an early release and there's all
05:10 - kinds of bugs and issues that could
05:12 - occur especially because you guys are
05:13 - Technical and you can actually kind of
05:15 - determine if something's a bug or if
05:17 - it's expected Behavior just because you
05:19 - guys have some experience programming so
05:21 - we received a ton of feedback in the app
05:23 - we actually have kind of like a form you
05:24 - can go into on the app to submit it and
05:27 - through the YouTube comment section
05:28 - which was extremely helpful so this
05:30 - isn't something that we struggled with
05:31 - it's just something I wanted to mention
05:32 - we kind of thought about this beforehand
05:34 - and we made sure there was a way for you
05:36 - guys to submit us feedback directly and
05:38 - we have an internal kind of admin
05:40 - dashboard where we can go and view all
05:42 - of that feedback and kind of check it
05:43 - off as completed like we've handled it
05:45 - we've responded to that now the one
05:46 - thing that we kind of missed here was
05:48 - collecting more information about where
05:51 - the feedback was coming from so this was
05:53 - you know my fault but I forgot to
05:54 - collect like the device uh the username
05:57 - like some other more important
05:58 - information that we'd want related to
06:00 - who's submitting the feedback so we
06:02 - still could track it to who did it but
06:03 - we had no way to communicate back with
06:05 - that user or to determine you know what
06:07 - device they were on if it was Android or
06:09 - iOS or what version of the app they were
06:11 - on because we had two versions at one
06:13 - point in time
06:14 - Etc so that was something that we should
06:15 - have collected that we didn't and now
06:17 - we're gonna have to add into the new
06:18 - version additionally we didn't allow
06:21 - users to submit like a video or a photo
06:23 - which obviously would have been really
06:24 - helpful so going forward we're probably
06:26 - going to add that to the feedback page
06:28 - just to give us some more clarity as to
06:30 - what the issue actually is so moving on
06:32 - the next thing I'll talk about is data
06:34 - and analytics now obviously there is
06:36 - analytics in the app we know all of the
06:38 - page views we have a bunch of events I
06:40 - spent a lot of time building this in
06:41 - however our infrastructure on the back
06:44 - end for kind of viewing all of this data
06:45 - analyzing it quickly is not the best and
06:48 - something that as a company we need to
06:49 - work on so even though we did build
06:51 - custom kind of admin and internal
06:53 - dashboards like analytics dashboards it
06:56 - was still difficult for us to kind of
06:57 - find the information that we were
06:58 - looking for once all of our users were
07:00 - on the app and generated all of this
07:02 - data and it was let's say more time
07:05 - consuming that it had to be to kind of
07:06 - filter through different events look
07:08 - through different data do queries we
07:10 - didn't have everything set up as
07:11 - robustly as we probably wanted so that's
07:14 - something we learned very quickly you
07:15 - know we have all of this data we want to
07:17 - start making decisions based on this but
07:19 - that takes time we don't even know
07:21 - necessarily how to view all this data
07:22 - correctly it's hard to really draw
07:24 - meaningful conclusions maybe we messed
07:26 - up an event in the app and that caused
07:28 - you know some questions on if our data
07:30 - was valid or not so just something to
07:32 - note there I can't really go into too
07:34 - much more depth beyond that but just the
07:35 - importance of analytics and being
07:37 - confident in the data that you have
07:39 - because you can have a ton of different
07:40 - data but if you're not sure where it's
07:42 - coming from or if you logged it
07:44 - correctly then that data kind of becomes
07:46 - meaningless alright next another lesson
07:48 - that we learned here was really the
07:49 - importance of our onboarding process so
07:52 - for our app we have kind of a multi-step
07:54 - onboarding process now admittedly this
07:56 - is not the best it needs some work and
07:58 - we kind of knew that before doing the
07:59 - release but this release really
08:01 - solidified in our minds you know how
08:03 - important it is to kind of change the
08:04 - onboarding and make it a more rapid
08:06 - entrance to to the app rather than this
08:08 - kind of slow you know multi-step thing
08:10 - where we're going to lose people along
08:12 - the way so that's what we noticed not
08:14 - you know crazy but we did lose a few
08:16 - users through the onboarding process and
08:18 - when users did get through the
08:20 - onboarding they didn't necessarily know
08:21 - where to go in the main application what
08:23 - I mean by that is we didn't have a great
08:25 - kind of starting point we didn't have
08:27 - you know like a guided tutorial of the
08:29 - app where we walked through all the
08:30 - features and I think and from what I saw
08:32 - from some of the feedback that we have a
08:34 - lot of users were kind of overwhelmed by
08:36 - the number of buttons and pages and they
08:38 - didn't know directly what to click on or
08:40 - kind of where to go now most of you were
08:41 - able to figure out the app I think some
08:43 - of you also watched my demo which
08:45 - probably helped but going forward we're
08:46 - going to need to revise that onboarding
08:48 - process and just make it more clear as
08:50 - to what the app is about what you're
08:52 - supposed to do and really simplify kind
08:53 - of the initial phase and then let you
08:55 - figure out the rest of the features
08:57 - afterwards so with that said guys I
08:59 - think that's going to wrap up kind of
09:00 - this first video this first kind of
09:02 - update about the release nothing
09:04 - critically horrible went wrong it wasn't
09:06 - any major mistakes overall the app's
09:09 - working it's scaling pretty well it
09:10 - hasn't been too expensive yet on
09:12 - Firebase generally speaking things are
09:14 - good a lot of you guys have been
09:16 - enjoying the app you've given some
09:17 - really positive feedback with that said
09:19 - of course there's bugs of course there's
09:21 - issues there's stuff that needs to be
09:22 - fixed there's some crashes that we need
09:23 - to address and those will all get fixed
09:26 - in the coming weeks months Etc I really
09:28 - appreciate all of you for supporting the
09:30 - startup for downloading the app from the
09:31 - link in the description and generally
09:33 - just for supporting me as I kind of go
09:35 - through this journey so I want to
09:36 - continue to update you on what's going
09:37 - on give you more information about
09:39 - analytics maybe you'll actually look at
09:41 - the kind of analytics dashboard in the
09:43 - next video let me know what you guys
09:44 - want to see and hear about the startup
09:46 - and with that said I will see you in
09:48 - another one
