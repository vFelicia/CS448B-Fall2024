00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:10 - youtube video so in today's video i'm
00:13 - gonna be sharing with you my programming
00:15 - slash developer goals for 2022 now in
00:18 - 2021 a lot of what i ended up doing was
00:20 - just working with technologies languages
00:22 - and frameworks that i already knew
00:24 - pretty well so i was getting some
00:26 - practice in but i wasn't really learning
00:28 - anything completely from scratch or
00:29 - something completely new that i haven't
00:31 - looked into before so for this year i
00:33 - really want to focus on learning some
00:35 - new technologies new frameworks new
00:37 - languages and being an absolute beginner
00:39 - at something once again because from my
00:41 - experience that's very fun that's super
00:43 - motivating and although it's great to
00:45 - kind of master what you already know
00:47 - sometimes it's nice to go right back to
00:48 - the beginning and kind of learn
00:50 - something completely from scratch so
00:51 - that's what this video is really going
00:52 - to be talking about all the new things
00:54 - that i really want to dive into in 2022.
00:57 - now before we go any further i want to
00:58 - give you guys an opportunity to share
01:00 - your goals with me so go leave a comment
01:03 - and tell me one goal that you have for
01:05 - 2022 as it relates to programming and
01:08 - software development and if you're
01:09 - someone who doesn't have any goals yet
01:10 - then maybe go and check out the comments
01:12 - and see if you can find any inspiration
01:14 - or technologies languages frameworks
01:16 - whatever it may be that you want to
01:18 - learn in this year i will also mention
01:21 - that one place that may be able to help
01:22 - you work on your goals for 2022 is the
01:25 - sponsor of this video which is career
01:27 - karma career karma is an awesome
01:29 - platform that helps connect developers
01:31 - like you to great boot camps and courses
01:33 - that jumpstart your career in tech i've
01:36 - worked with career karma for a long time
01:38 - now and share their mission of inspiring
01:40 - motivating and helping people get into
01:42 - the tech field career karma has content
01:45 - related to ui and ux data science web
01:49 - development and pretty much anything
01:51 - that you can think of and it helps you
01:52 - get into great boot camps to master
01:55 - these skills now one of my favorite
01:57 - parts about career karma is their

02:13 - was a hundred people that actually
02:14 - joined in got to talk to me and i shared
02:16 - some tips and advice on how you can get
02:18 - into the tech field and all kinds of
02:20 - other people that are experienced like
02:22 - myself are on that app hosting live

02:38 - session from career karma thanks again
02:41 - to career karma for sponsoring this
02:42 - video now let's get into it so in this
02:45 - video i'm going to share with you five
02:47 - goals that i have for 2022. these are
02:49 - all related to programming i have some
02:51 - in my personal life but maybe we'll
02:52 - leave those for another video but the
02:54 - first goal that i have here is to master
02:57 - css now css is something that i have
03:00 - always hated doing something that i
03:02 - really never spent the time to learn
03:04 - that i only ever use when i need to use
03:06 - it so i'll always try to use some
03:08 - framework that can do the css for me
03:10 - i'll copy and paste stuff from the
03:11 - internet and i almost never have any
03:13 - idea what any of the css for my websites
03:16 - or small projects that i'm working on is
03:18 - actually do it so i've already started
03:20 - actually during the christmas break
03:22 - trying to really learn the fundamentals
03:24 - of css even the complete basic stuff
03:26 - that i've just brushed over in the past
03:28 - and try to get better at it because it's
03:30 - not something that seems super
03:31 - complicated but it's just something that
03:33 - i've been putting off and something that
03:34 - i think that i should probably know
03:36 - after programming for almost about 10
03:38 - years so that is the first goal to
03:40 - really get good at css i hope that in a
03:42 - few months i'm able to do some advanced
03:44 - css animations i can style websites
03:47 - quite easily and it's no longer this
03:49 - kind of huge thing that i've been
03:50 - ignoring for a long time and i actually
03:52 - understand what's going on when i read
03:54 - basic css now the second goal that i
03:56 - have for 2022 kind of goes along with
03:58 - goal number one and this is really to
04:00 - get way better at front-end development
04:02 - so myself i really focus on kind of the
04:04 - back end languages java c plus python
04:08 - python is kind of the main language i
04:09 - use on this channel but i have used
04:11 - javascript before and typescript and
04:14 - when i used those languages i really
04:15 - enjoyed them but i never was really
04:17 - working in a front-end environment
04:19 - everything that i really do and that i'm
04:21 - good at is related to back and
04:22 - development maybe making games maybe
04:24 - making the back end of a website or
04:27 - making websites without really using any
04:28 - kind of advanced front-end techniques so
04:31 - this year i really want to focus on
04:32 - getting better on front-end development
04:34 - and kind of rounding myself out a bit
04:35 - because i have the back-end skills and
04:37 - now it's time to add the front-end
04:39 - skills and really be able to create some
04:40 - cool projects for me what limits me a
04:43 - lot when i'm working on something is
04:44 - that i can do all of the functionality
04:46 - all of the logic that's completely fine
04:48 - but when it comes to a nice kind of
04:49 - stylish front end or a nice functional
04:51 - front end for that matter somebody has a
04:53 - good user experience that's just
04:55 - something i'm lacking and something that
04:56 - i want to get better at this year so
04:58 - that's what i'm going to be focusing on
04:59 - i'll probably get into a few front-end
05:01 - frameworks i have worked with react in
05:03 - the past so i'll probably look at that a
05:04 - little bit more that's going to really
05:06 - complement well with the css skills i'll
05:08 - hopefully be building up and yeah
05:09 - hopefully by the end of the year you
05:11 - guys will actually be seeing some kind
05:12 - of more advanced front-end development
05:14 - tutorials on this channel so now my
05:16 - third goal for 2022 and this is to get
05:19 - better working with go slash go link now
05:22 - go is a programming language that i
05:23 - absolutely love writing in i learned it
05:26 - probably about two and a half years ago
05:27 - in a computer science course that i was
05:29 - taking at school we needed to use it to
05:31 - work on some different projects i really
05:33 - enjoyed working with it i got pretty
05:35 - good with it fairly quickly but since
05:37 - then i haven't really used it very much
05:39 - and i always keep thinking to myself oh
05:41 - i wish i could learn more about go oh i
05:42 - want to write this in go but i always
05:44 - kind of just default to python which is
05:46 - the language that i know best so this
05:48 - year i really want to make a conscious
05:49 - effort to try to write more stuff in go
05:52 - because a lot of the programs i write
05:53 - can be replicated in go and can actually
05:55 - be much more performant because go is
05:57 - kind of a high performance server side
06:00 - language it works for back end web
06:01 - development apis stuff like that so i
06:03 - want to learn more about go hopefully
06:05 - post some videos on this channel and i'm
06:07 - also considering adding this to the
06:09 - programming expert course that i have so
06:11 - if you guys don't know i have a course
06:13 - programming expert dot io is the link
06:15 - for it you can use discount code tim if
06:17 - you would like anyways it prepares you
06:19 - to become a software engineer and
06:20 - teaches you all the necessary coding
06:22 - skills but right now we just have python
06:24 - on there so i'm considering adding go as
06:26 - a second language and teaching kind of a
06:28 - statically typed language on there as
06:30 - well anyways that was a bit of a side
06:32 - track another goal to go along with that
06:34 - is to actually improve programming
06:35 - expert.io throughout the rest of the
06:37 - year and well to do that i'm going to
06:38 - have to learn more about go if you want
06:40 - to add it to that course all right so
06:42 - now we're moving on to goal number four
06:44 - which is to create an interesting
06:46 - decentralized application
06:48 - using the blockchain now i know a lot of
06:50 - you have realized that recently i've
06:52 - been posting a lot about cryptocurrency
06:54 - blockchain solidity developing on the
06:56 - blockchain nfts all of that type of
06:59 - stuff now i just want to start by saying
07:01 - i'm not trying to sell you anything this
07:02 - is going to be completely free whatever
07:04 - i end up doing no crypto scams here
07:06 - don't worry i'm not chilling any coins
07:08 - or anything like that i see a lot of
07:09 - people commenting saying that they're
07:11 - disappointed in me for talking about the
07:12 - blockchain when in reality all i'm doing
07:15 - is actually showing you how to develop
07:16 - on the blockchain completely for free
07:19 - i'm not trying to sell you anything i'm
07:20 - not promoting any coins or anything
07:22 - along those lines regardless what i want
07:24 - to do in 2022 is work on this idea that
07:27 - i had i'm gonna run it by you guys here
07:29 - please let me know if you think this is
07:30 - a cool idea in the comments so my idea
07:33 - was essentially to make it so in every
07:35 - single one of my videos there'd be some
07:37 - type of code that pops up pretty obvious
07:39 - probably in the intro something like
07:41 - tim1234 something along those lines and
07:44 - if you found this code in the video you
07:46 - could take it to a smart contract and
07:48 - redeem it for a free nft that shows that
07:51 - you watched my video so essentially a
07:53 - receipt saying hey you watched this tech
07:55 - with tim video now these nfts you could
07:58 - cash them in for coins these coins would
08:01 - be again completely free you just cash
08:02 - them in by watching my videos
08:04 - essentially and then you could use these
08:06 - coins to actually bid on or to enter
08:08 - like raffles or auctions where you could
08:10 - win prizes that i would provide to the
08:12 - community so the idea would be to
08:14 - encourage people to watch my videos if
08:16 - you watch them you can kind of find this
08:18 - code uh use it to redeem an nft you can
08:21 - then cash that nft in for some coins
08:23 - then use the coins in whatever way i'm
08:25 - going to determine it would be all kind
08:26 - of community related stuff giveaways
08:28 - maybe roles in my discord server
08:30 - whatever that was kind of the general
08:32 - concept now this would be a relatively
08:34 - complicated project because i need to
08:36 - come up with some way to actually give
08:37 - you nfts then a way to kind of cash
08:40 - those in for coins people that watch the
08:42 - video sooner would get more coins from
08:44 - their nft i would do stuff like that and
08:46 - then i'd have to figure out a website to
08:48 - interact with to claim the different
08:50 - prizes or whatever the roles are and
08:52 - stuff that i'm gonna give from the coins
08:54 - this is a very abstract concept but
08:55 - something that i want to try working on
08:57 - in 2022 let me know what you guys think
08:59 - of it if you think it's a good idea i'll
09:00 - definitely start working on it and i'll
09:02 - probably end up streaming actually me
09:04 - creating this whole thing because of
09:05 - course it's going to be open source and
09:07 - again this is all going to be free
09:09 - anyways that is that goal so get better
09:11 - with cryptocurrency blockchain
09:13 - technology and hopefully create
09:14 - something that you guys can interact
09:16 - with and use all right so now we are
09:18 - moving on to goal number five now this
09:20 - is not directly related to programming
09:22 - or software development but it is
09:24 - somewhat and that is to reach 1 million
09:26 - subscribers on youtube so at the time of
09:29 - filming this video i'm at about 870 000
09:32 - subscribers so it's a very achievable
09:34 - goal for me to try to get 1 million
09:36 - subscribers this year however this has
09:38 - been something i've been working towards
09:40 - for a very long time and the way i've
09:42 - been able to get subscribers is by
09:44 - learning more about programming and then
09:45 - sharing that knowledge with you guys so
09:47 - that kind of wraps up the end of the
09:49 - video here all of these four goals me
09:51 - learning all of these topics is really
09:53 - so that i can post a lot of the stuff
09:55 - that i learn and teach you guys what
09:57 - i've learned on this channel and
09:58 - hopefully reach that big milestone of 1
10:01 - million subscribers this year in 2022
10:04 - speaking of which if you are not
10:05 - subscribed please start helping me out
10:07 - to reach this goal by hitting the
10:08 - subscribe button down below leave a
10:10 - comment let me know your goals for 2022
10:13 - and if you think that kind of blockchain
10:14 - idea is interesting and i should do that
10:17 - and with that said i'm going to wrap up
10:19 - the video here i hope you guys enjoyed
10:21 - those are my goals please hold me to
10:23 - them and i will see you in another
10:25 - youtube video
10:26 - [Music]
10:34 - you
