00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back so my
00:02 - name is Tim and I am a second year
00:03 - computer science major what are we doing
00:06 - in this video is talking about the
00:07 - fundamental issues with the computer
00:09 - science or software engineering degree
00:11 - now the reason I'm making this video is
00:13 - because it's the year 2020
00:14 - you know the stem hype is real everyone
00:17 - and anyone is learning to program and
00:19 - changing into these stem and kind of
00:20 - science and tech related fields with the
00:23 - kind of idea that they're going to
00:24 - graduate and make a ton of money or get
00:26 - an awesome job now that's definitely
00:28 - possible and no hundreds of thousands of
00:30 - people are doing just that but you might
00:33 - not be the person that's going to be
00:34 - able to achieve that now I'm not trying
00:36 - to do this to be you know like de
00:38 - motivating but I really think you guys
00:39 - should listen to this video if you're
00:41 - someone that's maybe not super
00:42 - passionate about computer science or
00:44 - software engineering but it's jumping
00:46 - into this field so anyways let's go
00:48 - ahead and get started and talk about the
00:49 - problems with the computer science or
00:51 - software engineering degree now the
00:53 - first problem with computer science or
00:55 - software engineering is the lack of
00:56 - applicable skills or workplace skills
00:59 - now what I mean by this is essentially
01:01 - what you learn in your computer science
01:03 - degree is completely different than what
01:05 - you're going to end up doing at whatever
01:07 - job you end up working at now you might
01:09 - say this about every degree but this is
01:11 - specifically important for computer
01:12 - science because a lot of times when you
01:14 - go to get a job not only is it required
01:16 - that you have a computer science degree
01:17 - but it's required that you know or
01:19 - familiar with or have worked with a
01:21 - certain degree of key technologies or
01:23 - tools or even programming languages now
01:26 - universities are kind of you know famous
01:28 - for teaching outdated and older content
01:30 - and that's one of the main problems here
01:32 - so what you really need to do if you're
01:33 - in university is be learning these
01:35 - skills in your spare time now this
01:38 - actually leads me nicely into the
01:39 - sponsor of today's video which is simply
01:41 - learned I need to thank simply learn for
01:43 - sponsoring this video and giving you all
01:44 - a discount on their data science
01:45 - master's course that's been co-developed
01:47 - with IBM this course is comprised of six
01:49 - full courses covering key technologies
01:51 - like our SAS Python tableau Hadoop and
01:55 - spark while working through this course
01:57 - he'll develop 15 real-life projects and
01:59 - master over 30 in-demand skills you will
02:01 - work with advanced analytics tools such
02:03 - as pandas use data collection tools like
02:05 - Apache HBase and learn ETL tools like
02:07 - hive Pig and scoop by purchasing this
02:10 - course you'll have lifetime access to
02:11 - all the course content and lecture
02:13 - receive 1200 USD worth of IBM cloud
02:15 - credits and have access to the IBM cloud
02:17 - platforms like IBM Watson for 24/7
02:20 - practice upon completion will receive
02:22 - certificates from IBM and simply learn
02:24 - to testify to your skills as an expert
02:26 - in data science click the link in the
02:28 - description to get started so what I
02:30 - just showed you guys is not simply
02:32 - learned kind of add is an example of
02:33 - something you can do to learn these
02:36 - skills now that obviously is a little
02:37 - bit more extreme that's a huge massive
02:39 - course it's gonna teach you a ton of
02:41 - different things but just go and read
02:43 - through any different job postings if
02:44 - you're in computer science or software
02:46 - engineering and you know thinking about
02:47 - getting a job soon and start looking at
02:49 - the requirements that you need you know
02:51 - you need to know SQL you need to know
02:53 - front-end development you need to know
02:54 - this framework needs to know these three
02:56 - languages there's a lot of things that
02:58 - you're not going to have learned in a
03:00 - traditional computer science degree
03:02 - where you may be only covered two or
03:03 - three lane languages you didn't do with
03:05 - framework you haven't made an Android
03:07 - application and most of the jobs for
03:09 - computer science that are not these
03:11 - crazy high tech positions are very
03:13 - specific you need to be a developer in a
03:15 - very specific specific domain you need
03:18 - to know exactly what you're doing in a
03:19 - specific area or technology and other
03:22 - than you know kind of crappy entry level
03:24 - like automation and testing jobs you
03:26 - have to have these skills to get that
03:27 - job so this is the first issue with
03:29 - computer science is that a lot of the
03:31 - skills that you're learning throughout
03:32 - this degree like one compared to other
03:34 - degrees you're not actually gonna be
03:35 - able to bring and apply to your job and
03:37 - you're gonna have to learn new ones now
03:39 - this is totally fine but this is
03:41 - something you need to consider if you're
03:42 - jumping into this degree that a lot of
03:44 - the time you're gonna have to spend your
03:46 - spare time learning new modules learning
03:48 - new technologies you can't merely just
03:51 - do your degree and then expect it to
03:53 - jump out there and go get an amazing job
03:55 - there's a lot of extra work that goes
03:57 - into it and if you're not passionate
03:58 - about computer science chances are
04:00 - you're not gonna want to do that work
04:01 - alright so point number two is very
04:03 - similar to point number one but I think
04:05 - it's you know important enough to put an
04:07 - emphasis on it what you're learning in
04:09 - your classes most likely is already
04:12 - outdated technology now what I mean by
04:14 - that is I have a class for example where
04:16 - I'm looking at PowerPoint slides in my
04:18 - lab that were created in 2011 2010 right
04:22 - when the version of Windows isn't even
04:24 - the same on the
04:25 - utor they're showing you the example
04:26 - with than it is on my laptop or whatever
04:28 - right so that's just another big issue
04:30 - with computer science and education in
04:32 - general when it comes to fields that are
04:34 - growing so quickly like this they can't
04:36 - keep up right by the time they create a
04:38 - good curriculum for a specific
04:39 - technology tool or even just concept
04:41 - there's already something out that's
04:43 - better than it and this is a huge issue
04:44 - and kind of de motivating when it comes
04:46 - to computer science is that a lot of
04:48 - what you are learning in this degree is
04:50 - really outdated technology it's stuff
04:53 - that you know it's kind of cool to learn
04:54 - but there might be like 10 companies
04:56 - still using it right there's just really
04:59 - old stuff and you know I'm sure this
05:01 - isn't yesterday if you go to a top to
05:02 - your computer science school but if
05:04 - you're in kind of like a decentralized a
05:10 - dated curriculum I mean we know how
05:12 - quickly the education system moves and
05:14 - that's just something to think about is
05:16 - that you might not be working on you
05:17 - know the coolest newest stuff and if you
05:19 - are that's a luxury right I've been like
05:21 - I've used some software from like 2006 I
05:24 - think in some of my labs that doesn't
05:26 - even work they no longer have support
05:28 - for it you can't even download it on
05:29 - your home computer because it only works
05:31 - for Windows XP or Windows 7 so just
05:33 - something to consider it's a really
05:35 - outdated field and what this means is
05:36 - that you know like I said before you're
05:38 - gonna have to do a lot of work to learn
05:40 - these new frameworks and modules on your
05:42 - own time and that better mean that you
05:44 - know you enjoy computer science and you
05:45 - like learning that because if you don't
05:47 - that is really just gonna be hell for
05:48 - you you're gonna consider that almost
05:50 - another class right just to get a job
05:52 - and to learn a new skill but if you're
05:54 - into computer science and you're
05:55 - passionate about it you know that
05:56 - shouldn't be an issue that might be
05:57 - something that's even interesting to you
05:59 - you're gonna learn some older tack okay
06:00 - and then you're also gonna learn that
06:02 - new stuff and use your experience from
06:04 - the older tech to maybe learn that and
06:06 - get better with it so anyways that is a
06:07 - point number two so on to point number
06:10 - three which is the fact that computer
06:13 - science is extremely theoretical and
06:15 - when I say extremely I genuinely mean
06:18 - extremely you don't really realize how
06:21 - much math and theory and kind of
06:23 - background goes into computer science
06:26 - until you're in the degree like I am I
06:28 - have taken what is it Abhiyan 20 courses
06:30 - now so I've done 15 I'm enrolled in five
06:33 - and of those courses I believe I've
06:35 - ridden code and actually done
06:37 - development
06:37 - in six of them that number I need to
06:40 - fact-check because I'm not a hundred
06:41 - percent sure but that is like my
06:43 - estimate of how many classes I've
06:44 - actually done any development in
06:46 - computer science now as I get older and
06:48 - as I go into my third and fourth years
06:51 - there will be more programming and more
06:52 - computer science II kind of classes but
06:54 - this is something to consider that a lot
06:56 - of what you are learning in this degree
06:58 - is a very theoretical that's not to say
07:00 - that it's not important thing you don't
07:02 - need to know it but there's a lot of
07:03 - times where you kind of lose the fact
07:06 - that you're not applying this to a real
07:08 - life project you're not you know putting
07:09 - this into work you're not writing code
07:11 - to model this you're just you know on
07:13 - paper doing stuff by hand and it just is
07:16 - a little bit too motivating ask someone
07:18 - who's really into development and likes
07:20 - doing computer science stuff you don't
07:21 - get to see where do I actually use this
07:23 - you know where why am i learning all
07:25 - this math and all this background
07:27 - because you never really apply it and
07:29 - that's another issue that I have
07:30 - personally with the degree is they're
07:32 - teaching us these really useful skills
07:34 - like you know discrete mathematics and
07:35 - linear algebra but unless you really go
07:38 - out of your way you're not seeing this
07:40 - applied in the discipline like you
07:42 - should be now this might be a little bit
07:43 - different for software engineering
07:45 - because I know software engineering is
07:46 - more of a hands-on degree than Computer
07:48 - Sciences but a point that I wanted to
07:50 - make because this field is very very
07:52 - theoretical a lot of what you're doing
07:54 - is just you know proofs and math and you
07:57 - know some people like that
07:58 - I'm okay with it but I would like to see
08:01 - this applied more in the field and see
08:03 - like where am I actually gonna use this
08:04 - proof in math when it comes to
08:06 - developing code and you know in like a
08:07 - workplace environment so the last point
08:10 - I want to make here is about money
08:12 - now let's not lie to ourselves here a
08:13 - lot of us have probably gone into the
08:15 - computer science or software engineering
08:17 - field because of the opportunity to make
08:19 - a lot of money now there's a lot of
08:21 - different ways to do this in software
08:23 - engineering and computer science but all
08:25 - I'm going to say is you're not going to
08:26 - do that by just doing one of these
08:28 - degrees just getting one of these
08:30 - degrees is enough to get you like a
08:32 - decent entry-level job where you're
08:34 - probably gonna be making in Canada where
08:36 - I live and you guys can do the
08:37 - conversion rate like 70 grand a year 65
08:39 - grand a year and you know that's a very
08:41 - high starting salary but for what you
08:43 - did to get this degree that's not
08:46 - probably what you're looking for out of
08:48 - it there's a lot of other degrees that
08:50 - you can do
08:50 - that allow you know some better career
08:52 - developments and better just are easier
08:54 - and cheaper in general that can make you
08:56 - that kind of money or that you can at
08:57 - least get to that kind of money fairly
08:59 - quickly computer science can be
09:00 - extremely lucrative if you get into one
09:02 - of these top-tier companies like Google
09:04 - Microsoft Amazon Facebook whatever but
09:06 - if you're not there you're not going to
09:08 - be seeing these crazy high salaries that
09:10 - you know you're seeing all around the
09:12 - board you were hearing people and you
09:13 - know making 200k as an entry level
09:15 - engineer well that's because they're
09:17 - very good at what they do right you know
09:19 - they've a landed that job they've
09:21 - probably been working all throughout
09:22 - university building a portfolio and
09:24 - learning these new skills and if you're
09:26 - not that person don't expect you're
09:28 - gonna be getting salaries like that
09:29 - right you need to really apply yourself
09:31 - in this domain to make it worth your
09:33 - time and to be successful and that's
09:35 - something that this whole video is kind
09:36 - of been covering is the fact that this
09:38 - is a field that's changing so rapidly
09:39 - and so quickly that if you're not
09:41 - willing to keep up and continually be
09:43 - learning and kind of moving through this
09:45 - then you're not going to be successful
09:47 - in the field at least in my opinion now
09:50 - I urge you guys to go out there and
09:51 - prove me wrong and go just get a
09:53 - computer science degree and do nothing
09:55 - else and you know go work at Google and
09:56 - Amazon that'd be awesome I'd be you know
09:58 - thrilled to hear that but the reality is
10:00 - that that's probably not going to happen
10:02 - and if you're kind of you know playing
10:04 - the odds here if you're looking to get a
10:06 - computer science degree then you better
10:07 - commit to the fact that you're gonna be
10:08 - doing a lot of work outside of school
10:10 - and that you're passionate enough about
10:11 - this that you're okay to do that right
10:14 - because the whole thing is here a lot of
10:15 - people jump in when they're not
10:17 - passionate they don't enjoy the degree
10:18 - they're just doing it for the money and
10:20 - then you know they end up switching
10:21 - dropping and all that an appointed name
10:24 - and make here is the fact that this
10:25 - degree is difficult you know this isn't
10:27 - something anyone can just go and do
10:29 - we'll walk in the park
10:30 - you need to be you know smart enough you
10:32 - need to have the passion and you need to
10:34 - put in the work to get the results that
10:35 - you want so anyways that has been my
10:38 - thoughts on the problems with a computer
10:40 - science degree I understand a lot of
10:41 - these deal with the education system in
10:43 - general and that these will apply to
10:44 - other degrees as well but I just think
10:47 - it's so important in computer science
10:48 - that you're constantly learning outside
10:50 - of the degree that you're keeping your
10:52 - skills sharp and you're keeping
10:53 - up-to-date with the newer technologies
10:55 - because if you're not then you're gonna
10:57 - fall behind so anything that has been it
10:58 - I hope you guys enjoyed if you did leave
11:00 - a like subscribe to the channel and let
11:02 - me know what other videos
11:03 - you'd like to see coming up in the
11:04 - future
