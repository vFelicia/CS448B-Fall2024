00:00 - hello everybody and welcome to a much
00:02 - different video than i usually post
00:04 - on this channel in this video i'm going
00:05 - to be talking to you about this really
00:07 - cool laptop right here
00:08 - which is called the asus rog zephorus or
00:12 - zephyrus i'm not sure how you pronounce
00:13 - that duo 15. now this is a
00:16 - beast of a laptop it is by far the most
00:18 - powerful laptop that i've ever used
00:20 - and obviously you can tell just by
00:21 - looking at it's pretty unique in the
00:23 - sense that it has
00:23 - two screens here this second screen
00:25 - right here is actually a touch screen
00:27 - and i'll talk about that in this video
00:28 - anyways what i'm going to do here is
00:30 - just kind of give my first impressions
00:31 - and a quick
00:32 - look at this machine then i will talk to
00:34 - you quickly about some pros and cons
00:36 - i've noticed but when using this for
00:38 - pretty much the past two months
00:39 - so anyways let's get into this video and
00:41 - talk about this crazy laptop
00:43 - right here
00:46 - [Music]
00:52 - sorry for the quick interruption but i
00:54 - do need to mention that this is not a
00:56 - detailed review video i'm not going to
00:57 - be talking about all of the details of
00:59 - this machine
01:00 - i will be making one of those videos in
01:01 - the future so stay tuned for that
01:03 - but if you want more information about
01:05 - this device then there is some links in
01:06 - the description that you can press
01:08 - anyway sorry about that let's get into
01:10 - the video so even though this laptop is
01:11 - not that heavy i'm definitely not going
01:13 - to be holding it through the entire
01:14 - video so i'll run some kind of b-roll
01:16 - shot so you guys can see what it looks
01:18 - like but the first thing i need to say
01:19 - here is that this video
01:21 - is sponsored by intel and asus so they
01:24 - teamed up to make this super powerful
01:26 - machine right here
01:27 - this thing is powered by the 10th gen
01:29 - intel core i9 and that's an 8
01:31 - core processor well as some other crazy
01:34 - specs which i'll talk about in a second
01:35 - but intel and asus were kind enough to
01:37 - send me over this machine for free
01:39 - so i could make a video like this so
01:41 - anyways let's dive into the specs of
01:43 - this thing because this is crazy it
01:45 - blows most desktop computers
01:46 - out of the water as i said powered by
01:49 - the 10th gen
01:50 - intel core i9 the 8 core processor this
01:53 - has an rtx
01:54 - 2080 super for the graphics card that
01:56 - has eight gigabytes of vram inside of it
01:58 - has 32 gigabytes of ddr4 ram and then it
02:01 - has i believe
02:03 - two drives or i don't know the drive
02:05 - configuration but it has
02:06 - two terabytes of nvme ssd storage and
02:09 - that's running in
02:10 - raid 0 and then moving over to the
02:13 - displays
02:14 - this has a 4k main display which is 14
02:17 - inches
02:18 - and then the secondary display is a
02:19 - touch screen the main display is not a
02:21 - touch screen
02:22 - and it is scaled to 4k so because it's
02:24 - not you know a
02:25 - regular resolution screen you can't
02:27 - really call it 4k but in terms of pixel
02:29 - density it's
02:30 - pretty close i believe to 4k anyways
02:33 - this bottom screen here is a touch
02:34 - screen it's really cool there's a lot of
02:36 - functionality that it implements
02:37 - and at first i kind of thought it was
02:39 - gimmicky like just looked cool
02:41 - there actually is some pretty good use
02:42 - cases for the screen which i'll talk
02:44 - about later
02:45 - other than that this does not have a
02:46 - mechanical keyboard or anything crazy it
02:48 - just has your standard qwerty keyboard
02:50 - it is rgb though which is really cool it
02:53 - also has a
02:54 - trackpad on the right hand side of the
02:56 - laptop which again i've never seen
02:57 - before
02:58 - kind of an awkward place for it but i've
03:00 - gotten used to it as i've used it
03:01 - and then it also has this cool thing
03:03 - where you can turn the trackpad into a
03:05 - numpad
03:06 - uh by activating this like i guess laser
03:08 - or holographic kind of uh
03:10 - overlay on top of it so anyways really
03:13 - interesting device as i said and the
03:14 - reason i'm saying interesting is because
03:16 - i do really like it it's super powerful
03:19 - but at the same time it has a few kind
03:21 - of quirks and some awkward things about
03:23 - it that i don't know how to feel about
03:24 - so anyways now i'm just going to quickly
03:26 - talk to you about kind of
03:28 - my experience using this laptop and what
03:30 - i think because obviously this is a
03:32 - super powerful laptop this is really
03:34 - geared towards people that are going to
03:35 - be gaming or streaming off of this thing
03:38 - or people that are looking to have some
03:40 - kind of portable content creation
03:41 - machine right like you can do video
03:43 - editing on this
03:44 - whatever you would need to do this
03:46 - laptop has the power to be able to
03:48 - accommodate you
03:49 - so now i just want to take a minute and
03:50 - talk about this second screen because
03:52 - this is kind of the focus of this laptop
03:54 - and one of its key marketing points so a
03:57 - lot of people that have seen this and
03:58 - i've shown a lot of my friends
03:59 - and kind of got their thoughts
04:01 - immediately just said you know that
04:02 - second screen is cool but
04:03 - when would i ever use it and in fact i
04:05 - have to be honest the second screen at
04:07 - first when i saw it i thought the same
04:08 - thing i'm like okay this is
04:09 - cool but it's kind of gimmicky like i
04:12 - don't know if i would really have a use
04:13 - for it
04:14 - after using this laptop for about two
04:16 - months i can say that the second screen
04:17 - definitely does come in handy
04:19 - for me personally if i'm programming on
04:21 - this laptop or i'm doing some kind of
04:23 - video editing it's really nice to have a
04:24 - second window right at the bottom
04:26 - now this screen is on a 13 degree tilt
04:29 - so it's kind of at a perfect eye level
04:31 - you actually can't adjust the screen so
04:33 - it can't go up and down
04:34 - but it's a touch screen which is really
04:36 - nice and i find myself just using it to
04:38 - kind of reference things right so if i'm
04:39 - typing something on the main display
04:41 - now i don't need to tab out and look in
04:43 - another window i can kind of just have
04:44 - that at the bottom here
04:46 - and since it's long enough i can read
04:47 - text off of there i've even found myself
04:49 - doing some kind of scrubbing through the
04:51 - timeline so i put my
04:52 - adobe whatever adobe premiere timeline
04:55 - on the bottom here
04:56 - and use my finger to actually scrub
04:57 - through the timeline and that seems to
04:59 - be pretty effective
05:00 - so there is definitely some use cases
05:01 - for this bottom screen i think you kind
05:03 - of need to be creative in how you use it
05:06 - but personally i found myself liking it
05:08 - and using it
05:09 - and yeah i think it definitely does have
05:11 - a use so that's
05:12 - kind of the point of this now it also
05:13 - has kind of a little control board here
05:15 - where you can activate the num key you
05:17 - can put a bunch of windows you can
05:19 - change the brightness
05:20 - just some kind of standard things i
05:22 - don't find this very useful at all but
05:24 - i guess it's cool to have some controls
05:26 - that you can do specifically on this
05:28 - on this little screen right here so now
05:30 - moving on to kind of my first
05:31 - impressions and just some initial pros
05:33 - and cons of this device
05:34 - first of all i do actually really like
05:36 - this second screen as i mentioned
05:38 - the 4k looks amazing this is just a
05:40 - really great screen i haven't seen many
05:42 - screens other than apple screens that
05:44 - look this good
05:45 - this obviously is super powerful this
05:47 - can handle all my editing tasks
05:49 - if i need to go somewhere for a week or
05:51 - i just i don't have access to my big
05:53 - desktop
05:54 - this is really nice because i know that
05:56 - i have the power that i need to
05:57 - accomplish my kind of day-to-day tasks
05:59 - and obviously as a content creator i do
06:02 - need a powerful machine to do a lot of
06:03 - the rendering and editing that i do
06:05 - even just coding on this thing is really
06:07 - nice it's super fast super snappy
06:09 - i can you know run as much stuff as i
06:11 - need to and no issue whatsoever
06:13 - the fact that it has 32 gigabytes of ram
06:16 - is a huge asset and the graphics card
06:18 - although i don't really need it it's
06:19 - really nice if i want to do something
06:20 - with machine learning or anything else
06:22 - that's going to utilize the gpu even
06:24 - just a little bit of light gaming
06:26 - so that's kind of my initial pros and
06:28 - thoughts on this laptop
06:29 - i will say that it is just really
06:32 - awkward to have on your lap so the
06:34 - keyboard
06:35 - since it's so far back to make room for
06:37 - this top screen here
06:38 - makes it really awkward to actually type
06:40 - on i find myself kind of having my
06:41 - shoulders
06:42 - up and my elbows back and i can't type
06:44 - nearly as fast as i usually do on say
06:46 - this macbook keyboard
06:48 - and it's just it is an awkward keyboard
06:50 - it's fine i can live with it but it is
06:52 - really strange and then
06:53 - the palm of your hands are kind of
06:55 - resting right on the edge of the
06:56 - keyboard
06:57 - and it's just it's just not the best
06:58 - thing in the world and same thing with
07:00 - this trackpad here
07:01 - this is a really awkward trackpad i find
07:03 - myself having to use my thumb to
07:04 - actually press down on the buttons
07:06 - because i'm using my index finger to
07:08 - scroll around and i just
07:09 - i don't know it's just awkward to me i
07:11 - don't like it and it's not in the middle
07:13 - which i'm used to in most traditional
07:14 - laptops
07:15 - so that's kind of the main downfalls for
07:17 - me it's just the fact that the second
07:18 - screen is here is nice
07:20 - but i don't know if it makes up for the
07:21 - fact that it's a very awkward layout on
07:23 - the keyboard
07:24 - and it just doesn't feel very natural to
07:26 - use
07:27 - other than that the other two
07:29 - disadvantages or kind of cons that i've
07:30 - noticed about this laptop
07:32 - is that it gets super hot and it gets
07:34 - super loud
07:35 - like i want to use this thing in a video
07:37 - and i want to have it sitting on my desk
07:38 - just like this but unless i go in and
07:40 - manually tweak the settings this
07:42 - thing's fan is so loud that my mic which
07:44 - is right here is picking it up and just
07:46 - makes my audio sound horrible
07:48 - i really like a completely silent device
07:50 - i don't want to hear
07:51 - any fans whatsoever and you know if i
07:53 - were to bring this to school for example
07:55 - obviously not now
07:56 - and i open it up and all of a sudden the
07:58 - fan starts going crazy like i'm just
07:59 - gonna have to shut it down immediately
08:01 - because
08:01 - i don't need that kind of attention in a
08:03 - public space or in a lecture or
08:05 - something like that so
08:06 - that's the main thing that i've noticed
08:08 - just because this thing is so damn
08:10 - powerful
08:10 - it uses so much power like it needs so
08:13 - much electricity
08:14 - and of course there's so much heat being
08:16 - generated by this 10th gen
08:18 - i9 and this 2080 super inside of here
08:21 - so anyways that's kind of my first look
08:23 - at this laptop right here i'm going to
08:25 - be doing a detailed review i haven't
08:27 - used this a ton i've just brought a few
08:28 - places with me
08:29 - and that's what i've noticed again
08:31 - advantages just super powerful can
08:33 - handle anything that i need
08:35 - be nice i can kind of game on this if i
08:36 - brought a mouse with me or something
08:38 - like that but
08:39 - do i think that it's worth it at this
08:40 - point in time i'm not sure i'm gonna
08:42 - have to figure out and use this more so
08:44 - anyways i hope you guys enjoyed this
08:45 - video i know it's a little bit different
08:46 - than what i usually do
08:48 - i'm not a huge you know hardware review
08:50 - guy or anything like that
08:51 - but i figured we could sit down have a
08:53 - look at this and you know at this point
08:54 - in time i'd love to hear your guys
08:55 - thoughts on this in the comments
08:57 - so anyways let me know what you think
08:58 - leave a like on this video subscribe to
09:00 - the channel and i will see you in
09:02 - another youtube video
