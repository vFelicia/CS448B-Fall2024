00:02 - [Music]
00:06 - hello everybody and welcome back on
00:08 - their flutter tutorial so in today's
00:10 - video what we're gonna be doing is just
00:12 - learning about how flutter works getting
00:14 - a really good introduction building our
00:16 - own widgets and building a really basic
00:18 - layout this is not gonna be anything
00:20 - anything fancy by any means but this is
00:23 - really fundamental we need to understand
00:24 - this before we can move forward and
00:26 - build some cooler stuff
00:27 - so to give you guys kind of a tease and
00:29 - a sneak peek for what we're gonna be
00:30 - working on at the future of this
00:32 - tutorial series or as we go through this
00:34 - tutorial series what I'm planning on
00:36 - doing is actually integrating whatever
00:37 - we make with a firebase database so I
00:40 - want to show you how we can actually
00:41 - work with databases and what I want to
00:44 - do to illustrate that is actually make
00:46 - some kind of blog application so make
00:48 - something where people can leave
00:49 - comments or make some posts people can
00:51 - vote on those posts and then the post it
00:53 - up the most amount of votes will be
00:54 - shown to the most amount of users so
00:56 - we'll do something cool like that
00:57 - there's a lot of other stuff we can add
00:59 - if we decide to go down that route
01:01 - so if you guys have ideas that related
01:03 - to that please do leave a comment down
01:04 - below and I'll definitely consider them
01:06 - alright so with that being said let's
01:09 - actually just start walking through what
01:10 - we have kind of so far we're gonna
01:13 - actually start by just going to line 33
01:15 - and deleting everything that's down
01:18 - there so literally everything and we're
01:20 - gonna go to line 29 and we're gonna
01:22 - delete where it says my home page like
01:24 - that so we're gonna leave up to line 32
01:28 - modifying line 29 and I'm just gonna
01:31 - explain this to start and then we'll
01:33 - actually build our own widget and start
01:34 - messing around with that so first thing
01:37 - this pane on the left hand side of my
01:39 - screen is really useful and I'd
01:40 - recommend you guys pull it up when
01:41 - you're coding just hit this flutter tab
01:43 - right here it should be at the very
01:45 - bottom of your bar and vs code you're
01:47 - only gonna see that though if you have
01:48 - the flutter extension installed from the
01:50 - extensions paint so make sure you have
01:53 - that again you're gonna want that dart
01:55 - extension as well if you didn't install
01:56 - that in the last one so that you get all
01:58 - the nice autocompletes and everything
02:00 - that you're gonna see me using so to
02:02 - start we have an import statement this
02:04 - import statement just brings in all the
02:06 - necessary packages classes modules tools
02:08 - whatever it may be that we need to use
02:10 - in flutter now material is the most
02:12 - basic
02:13 - kind of package in flutter most of the
02:15 - stuff we're using is gonna be from here
02:17 - but you can of course import a ton of
02:19 - stuff and you can also import
02:20 - third-party libraries as well and maybe
02:23 - we'll show how to do that in like a much
02:26 - future video in this tutorial series now
02:28 - next we have what's known as the entry
02:30 - point of our application so this is
02:33 - specific to dart whenever you have a
02:35 - void main' this is pretty much saying
02:37 - hey this is what i want to run as soon
02:40 - as i run the program so let's say I just
02:42 - made a program that said boy made and
02:44 - inside of here I went print hello world
02:46 - or something like that then as soon as
02:48 - the program ran we just immediately
02:50 - print hello world so this is the entry
02:53 - point whatever you put inside a void
02:54 - main' which is the main function will
02:57 - run as soon as you run the program so in
02:59 - this case we're gonna call run app which
03:01 - is a function we get from here and this
03:03 - is going to run my app which is a class
03:05 - that is defined here now notice there's
03:08 - a lot of stuff that says widget that's
03:10 - because flutter uses widgets for doing
03:12 - all of its drawing and pretty much
03:14 - handling everything within the framework
03:16 - a widget is really just something that
03:18 - has some properties and may potentially
03:20 - have some State or it could be rendered
03:22 - to the screen so we have all different
03:24 - kinds of widgets the most basic ones I
03:26 - can think of is something like a text
03:27 - widget and then some ones that maybe
03:29 - you're a bit more complicated we'll deal
03:31 - with like formatting and layouts like
03:32 - maybe a row widget or a column widget
03:35 - and these widgets can store widgets
03:37 - within them so you're gonna see as we
03:39 - start building out applications we're
03:41 - gonna be kind of building a widget tree
03:43 - where we have this upper level widget
03:44 - that stores lower widgets below it so if
03:47 - you modify the upper level widget
03:49 - everything will get changed so from the
03:52 - top down to the very bottom all those
03:54 - changes will be kind of cascading and
03:56 - that widget will be redrawn onto the
03:58 - screen now there's more to talk about
04:00 - with that but let's just go into my app
04:02 - and explain the basics of how this works
04:03 - I'm gonna get rid of all these comments
04:05 - because I'm not gonna read them and they
04:07 - just take up a lot of space in here okay
04:10 - so let's get rid of that and now it
04:11 - immediately looks a little bit less
04:12 - intimidating so you can see this first
04:15 - comment won't all read this one says
04:17 - this widget is the root of your
04:19 - application so when we make a new
04:21 - program the first thing we do is we make
04:23 - our root widget so the root widget in
04:25 - this case is called my app we can name
04:27 - this
04:28 - ever you want or you can name this
04:29 - whatever you want but it's just a class
04:31 - and this extends a stateless widget now
04:34 - a stateless widget it's just saying this
04:37 - widget does not have state it's not
04:39 - going to be changing based on our
04:41 - interaction with it in the program so
04:43 - we're gonna call it stateless and what
04:45 - that means is all we need to do when we
04:46 - make a stateless widget is override a
04:49 - method called build so this is what's
04:51 - known as the parent class essentially
04:53 - you can think of my app kind of taking
04:55 - all of the functionality from this class
04:57 - and just altering it altering it very
04:59 - slightly so stateless widget is right
05:01 - from flutter when we extend stateless
05:04 - widget it has a bunch of functionality
05:06 - that's already defined and all we do is
05:08 - we tell it what we actually want this
05:10 - widget to look like where it should be
05:12 - if it's storing anything else so since
05:15 - this is the root widget of our
05:16 - application what we're returning is a
05:18 - material app now a material app just set
05:22 - up the actual app for us and defines the
05:25 - homepage for our application now if you
05:27 - ever hover over any of these widgets you
05:29 - can see all of the different parameters
05:30 - that they have so like title locale show
05:33 - performance overlay show semantics T
05:35 - bugger right navigation key home initial
05:38 - route routes all this stuff that we're
05:40 - going to talk about later but just know
05:41 - that you can hover over any of these
05:43 - classes and you'll be able to see all of
05:45 - the parameters and kind of how they're
05:46 - used
05:47 - so if you're stuck if you're lost hover
05:48 - over something and you might be able to
05:50 - see some meaningful information it looks
05:53 - like a big blob of mess but you can see
05:55 - home for example is right here and while
05:58 - I have home defined there so just
05:59 - telling us the different parameters that
06:01 - we can pass here so whenever we make an
06:03 - app the first thing we do is we pass a
06:05 - title in this case it's called fluttery
06:07 - demo I'm just gonna change this to Tim's
06:09 - app right now we pass a theme that has
06:13 - primary swatch so this is just going to
06:15 - be the primary color and then visual
06:17 - density now visual density is telling us
06:20 - essentially do we change the density of
06:23 - our application or how it looks based on
06:25 - what platform we're on so far on Android
06:27 - or iOS should we adapt to that when we
06:30 - go adaptive platform density that's what
06:32 - that does that that's what that's saying
06:34 - now this is kind of complicated I don't
06:35 - understand this entirely but it's just
06:38 - changing the feature of how the app
06:39 - works based on what
06:41 - or how the app looks sorry based on what
06:43 - operating system it's on so we'll just
06:45 - leave that like that that's what the
06:47 - people in the flutter tutorial have done
06:48 - gay primary swatch this is the theme of
06:51 - your app so what colors it's going to
06:52 - look like you can change this obviously
06:54 - so let's actually go ahead and change
06:56 - this to say orange we can go deep orange
06:58 - orange accent and it's kind of cool
06:59 - because you can actually have a look at
07:01 - what all of the stuff looks like if you
07:03 - just kind of scroll through here so
07:04 - let's make it colors orange and then
07:07 - what we're gonna do is leave the visual
07:09 - density and now talk about home so home
07:11 - is going to be the home page of your
07:13 - application so this is defining the
07:15 - actual app but we haven't defined what's
07:17 - actually going to show up on the app or
07:19 - what we're gonna see when we draw the
07:21 - application and in fact if I save this
07:23 - here you can see that nothing is showing
07:25 - up on my phone here because we have an
07:28 - error there's nothing that we've given
07:30 - for the home page and we need to give
07:32 - something for the home page if we want
07:33 - this to refresh and show up on our app
07:35 - so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
07:38 - make a widget now we're gonna walk you
07:39 - through how we do that and we're gonna
07:41 - place that widget here as our home page
07:44 - so when we make a widget what we're
07:46 - gonna do is pretty much copy exactly
07:48 - what we've done here except change what
07:50 - we're returning from this build method
07:52 - that we have to override so we're just
07:54 - gonna define a class we're gonna say
07:55 - class my home page we'll just stick with
07:58 - the names that they were using and we'll
08:00 - say this extends the stateless widget so
08:05 - stateless widget like that now we'll add
08:07 - our brackets and notice we're getting
08:09 - this red squiggly line so I'm gonna
08:10 - hover over it and it says missing
08:12 - concrete implementation of stateless
08:14 - widget dot build what that means is we
08:16 - need to override this build method so
08:20 - I'm gonna copy this that override widget
08:22 - build I'm just gonna paste it in here
08:25 - like that now what this does is this
08:27 - says okay we're gonna override this
08:29 - methods you can see that red squiggly
08:30 - line is gone and inside of here what we
08:33 - need to do is return any widgets because
08:35 - this is telling us we have a return type
08:38 - of type widget that we want to show on
08:40 - the screen so that brings me to another
08:42 - thing here dart is a typed language so
08:45 - you need to actually define the types of
08:47 - all your parameters the return types of
08:49 - all your functions and your methods and
08:51 - we're going to be using classes and
08:52 - object-oriented stuff as well with
08:54 - genera
08:55 - if you know what that is so this is a
08:58 - not definitely not a beginner language
09:00 - it on easy language it's very similar to
09:02 - something like Java so just keep that in
09:04 - mind as we go through that the reason
09:05 - I'm writing all this stuff is because
09:07 - we're not working in a nice language
09:08 - like Python or JavaScript where we don't
09:11 - actually have to define the types we
09:13 - have to define the types or pretty much
09:14 - everything that we do so what I'm gonna
09:16 - do is I'm gonna return a widget from
09:19 - here so since this says widget that
09:21 - means I must return some widget and same
09:23 - thing for this one we must return a
09:25 - widget which in this case is material
09:26 - app now whenever we start making app at
09:29 - least for now
09:29 - we're gonna return the scaffold the
09:32 - scaffold widget now this just sets up a
09:35 - basic structure of a page so essentially
09:37 - it just setting up like a regular page
09:39 - that we're gonna be able to see when we
09:42 - run the application and scaffold can
09:44 - hold other widgets inside of it
09:46 - which we'll see in a second but we
09:47 - usually just start with scaffold so now
09:50 - we've made our first widget and all this
09:52 - widget is doing is returning another
09:53 - widget that we want to see on the screen
09:55 - when it's getting built it's returning
09:57 - that scaffold widget so inside of home
10:00 - right here I'm gonna put my home page as
10:02 - the widget that I want to render for my
10:05 - home page that's all I'm doing I could
10:07 - change I can make another class and I
10:09 - can swap this out and that would change
10:10 - the home page of my application so now
10:13 - we're gonna press that hot reload button
10:14 - although I don't think we actually have
10:15 - to press that and we can see we just
10:17 - have this white app right here
10:19 - there we go now what I want to do is I
10:21 - want to show you what happens if I get
10:23 - rid of scaffold and say just returned
10:25 - some text widget so let's say I just
10:27 - returned text and I go and I return like
10:30 - hi or something like that and we have a
10:33 - look now we can see that we're getting
10:34 - these yellow underlines this red weird
10:36 - text and everything just looks strange
10:38 - right it doesn't look proper it's a
10:40 - black background it looks like we're
10:42 - missing something that's because we need
10:43 - to add that scaffold widget which just
10:45 - sets up the page and makes it kind of
10:47 - ready to add more widgets to I gives us
10:50 - like a nice structure for the page so
10:52 - now if we look when I add scaffold we
10:53 - can see it's just white alright so
10:57 - that's it for scaffold now inside of
10:59 - here what we're gonna do is we're gonna
11:00 - have the child widgets of a scaffold so
11:03 - the first thing I want to do is I want
11:04 - to add a little menu bar to my app so I
11:07 - want to add something at the top maybe
11:08 - not a menu bar but
11:09 - a title that says hey you know this is
11:11 - this application so to do that this is
11:13 - called an app bar so what we're gonna do
11:15 - is we're gonna type app bar colon and
11:17 - we're gonna put an app bar instance here
11:20 - so half the bar
11:21 - now again all of these things are
11:23 - widgets so this is a widget and this
11:25 - scaffold is a widget and essentially on
11:28 - these widgets we have a build method
11:30 - that tells us what to display when this
11:32 - widget gets built now that could be
11:34 - another widget right and inside of this
11:36 - scaffold widget there would be a build
11:38 - method that says what we should build
11:40 - when this scaffold widget gets built
11:43 - right so just keep that in mind all of
11:44 - these different things are widgets and
11:46 - you can see that in the flutter outline
11:48 - here because it has the flutter logo
11:50 - beside them all right so now app bar
11:53 - inside of here we need to define what we
11:55 - want the title of our app to me so again
11:57 - we're having widgets nested inside of
11:59 - witches so title and the title is going
12:02 - to be a text widget that is going to say
12:04 - hello world like that so now we have a
12:09 - scaffold widget that has an app bar that
12:12 - app bar is equal to an app bar widget
12:15 - that has a title which is equal to a
12:17 - text widget so all these different
12:19 - things are widgets and now if we look in
12:21 - our kind of our tree on the outline here
12:23 - we have scaffold app bar text so it
12:25 - shows us kind of a hierarchy and it's
12:27 - really nice to be able to look at that
12:28 - and see how this tree is kind of formed
12:30 - so anywhere that I use my home page now
12:34 - it will actually return this scaffold
12:38 - which will return the app bar which will
12:39 - return the text right so we could
12:41 - technically reuse this on another page
12:43 - if we wanted to just keep that in mind
12:46 - okay so now that we have that will
12:48 - actually just have a look at our app and
12:50 - we can see we have a nice orange theme
12:51 - and we get hello world as our title bar
12:54 - okay awesome so that's looking pretty
12:56 - good the next thing I want to do is I
12:58 - want to add a body to my scaffold so I'm
13:02 - gonna say body colon and inside of here
13:04 - we're gonna keep it really basic and I'm
13:05 - gonna say text and I'm just going to go
13:08 - hello world once again so now we have a
13:12 - scaffold it has an app bar and it has a
13:15 - button now notice when I saved it
13:17 - automatically formatted this that's
13:20 - great we want that so it keeps things
13:22 - nice and
13:22 - clean and even adds these automatic kind
13:25 - of hidden Commons so slash slash
13:26 - scaffold to tell us where all of these
13:28 - widgets end just to keep things clean
13:31 - and easy to actually view because as you
13:32 - have a ton of different widgets things
13:34 - get pretty complicated pretty fast so
13:36 - it's nice to be able to see like oh
13:37 - that's the end of material app that's
13:39 - the end of theme data so on so forth so
13:42 - let's see it now and have a look and we
13:44 - get hello world text showing up at the
13:46 - bottom and there we go we have now
13:48 - officially built our very first widget
13:50 - so we have this widget my home page and
13:53 - well we have the home page right here
13:55 - that shows that widget this widget shows
13:57 - a scaffold the scaffold has an app bar
13:59 - and it has a body now inside of the body
14:02 - of course we can add another widget we
14:04 - can add a bunch of other stuff and to
14:06 - conclude this tutorial what I will do is
14:08 - build one last widget we'll go pretty
14:10 - fast actually and then we will display
14:13 - that widget multiple times so I can show
14:15 - you how we reuse it so I'm gonna say
14:16 - class I'm just gonna say test widget
14:19 - like that we're gonna say that extends
14:22 - again the stateless widget will talk
14:24 - about stateful widgets later
14:26 - so stateless widget and inside of here
14:29 - I'm gonna say at override nope I don't
14:33 - know why it automatically completes that
14:35 - let me say widget builds and we're gonna
14:38 - go build context like that will save
14:42 - context and inside of the brackets we
14:45 - are going to return in this case I'm
14:47 - just gonna do a very simple tax widget
14:49 - so I'm just gonna say hello
14:51 - oops hello world like that awesome so
14:55 - now we have this other widget it's a
14:57 - test widget and what I'm gonna do is I'm
14:59 - gonna replace my body with a bunch of
15:02 - different test widgets and I'm actually
15:03 - gonna put these test widgets in a column
15:06 - now I won't explain this a ton because I
15:08 - am planning on wrapping up this tutorial
15:10 - series shortly but I mean that a column
15:12 - widget like that and inside of the
15:14 - column what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
15:16 - say children like that and this is going
15:18 - to be equal to a list of widgets and
15:21 - these are gonna be all the widgets that
15:23 - I want to display within a column so
15:25 - when you add the column widget this
15:27 - isn't gonna show anything itself but
15:29 - what its gonna do is align the children
15:31 - of it in a column so they're above and
15:33 - below each other now what it what
15:36 - what children takes is a list of widgets
15:39 - so what I need to do is I need to say
15:41 - well we want a list which you represent
15:44 - in darts by just using two brackets like
15:46 - this and they need to be of type widget
15:48 - so we put the angle brackets like that
15:50 - we put widget inside of it and we say
15:53 - okay this list is going to contain a
15:55 - bunch of widgets
15:56 - now since this test widget is a widget
15:59 - it extends stateless widget we can put
16:01 - that inside of here so I'm going to say
16:03 - test widget like that and I'm going to
16:07 - do comma test widget like that now let's
16:12 - see oops not text widget that's going to
16:14 - be test widget sorry so now we have to
16:16 - test widgets inside of here and actually
16:19 - what I'll do is I'll add another one and
16:20 - I'll show you how this works so now we
16:22 - have three children for the column that
16:25 - is our body so let's have a look at how
16:27 - this looks when we have a look at the
16:29 - screen and now we get three hello worlds
16:31 - in a column there we go
16:33 - now to finish this off I'm gonna just
16:36 - change this to a row and just show you
