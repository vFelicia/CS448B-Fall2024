00:00 - hello everyone and welcome to kind of
00:02 - the first official machine learning
00:04 - tutorial were actually gonna be writing
00:06 - code and reading in data so in this
00:08 - video essentially we're gonna be getting
00:10 - a big data set and we're gonna be
00:11 - minimizing that data set to use the
00:14 - valuable information out of it which is
00:16 - very important and is honestly probably
00:18 - the hardest thing with machine learning
00:19 - is getting your data in the right form
00:21 - and using proper and valid data and then
00:24 - we're gonna be actually in the next
00:26 - video implementing it's called a linear
00:28 - regression algorithm to predict grades
00:31 - based on kind of student behavior in
00:34 - student past grades so that's a data set
00:36 - we're going to be using it's actually
00:37 - what I have open here which I'm going to
00:38 - talk about in just a second but before I
00:40 - move into all of that I just want to say
00:42 - that if you'd like to follow along with
00:43 - the tutorials and see all of the code
00:44 - have all of the data go to my website
00:46 - tech with Tim net if you go to the
00:49 - tutorials page here you will see I I
00:51 - know you don't see it right now but
00:52 - it'll be a little box here that says
00:54 - machine learning with Python and if you
00:56 - click on that you'll find the tutorial
00:58 - series and you could go through and it's
01:00 - gonna have all the code all of the data
01:01 - everything that I write in kind of some
01:03 - descriptions as well it's not gonna be
01:05 - as extensive as the video but just in
01:07 - case you want to get all the code and
01:08 - stuff it'll be on the website so I
01:10 - recommend you follow along with that and
01:11 - that's gonna be for the future of all
01:13 - these machine learning videos as well ok
01:16 - so back to our data now with machine
01:18 - learning data is obviously the most
01:21 - important part by far now the algorithms
01:24 - are actually fairly easy to implement
01:25 - but we have to implement them on certain
01:28 - data and our data has to be in a correct
01:29 - form in a correct shape and it has to be
01:32 - well valid data like it has to make
01:34 - sense right so essentially what I'm
01:36 - doing is I'm just gonna download a data
01:37 - set off of this UCI machine learning
01:39 - repository website and they have a ton
01:42 - ton of ton of datasets so I just picked
01:45 - this one because I thought it was kind
01:46 - of interesting student performance data
01:48 - set and essentially you guys can read
01:49 - the data set information this link will
01:51 - be in the description and on my website
01:52 - as well and it goes through a bunch of
01:55 - things that I want to walk through them
01:56 - with you so that if you want to pick
01:58 - your own data sets off the website you
01:59 - kind of know how to do that and what all
02:01 - these different things mean so probably
02:04 - some of the more important things I
02:06 - guess actually I'm just gonna read
02:07 - through them all and I guess I'll talk
02:08 - about them as we go so data set
02:10 - characteristics here and I'll show you
02:12 - these all on the main page
02:13 - when you select datasets as well
02:15 - multivariate of just means it has I
02:17 - believe more than two variables so you
02:19 - don't just have like one variable
02:20 - corresponding to the other one there's a
02:22 - ton of different attributes that will
02:24 - apply to a certain label or
02:25 - classification characteristics don't
02:28 - worry about that attribute
02:29 - characteristics that's actually
02:30 - incorrect but associated tasks
02:32 - classification regression this is just
02:35 - what it's good for typically you can
02:36 - obviously use this data set with other
02:38 - kind of algorithms but that's what it
02:39 - recommend is number of instances is how
02:42 - many instances are like people or in
02:44 - this case students are actually in the
02:46 - data set number of attributes is how
02:48 - many attributes for every single
02:51 - instance okay quick sidenote
02:52 - if you guys hear me like coughing or
02:54 - notice I'm a little bit uh no that's
02:57 - good I usually am I am a little sick
02:58 - right now so if you notice my boys'll
03:00 - raspy please excuse me so it data set
03:03 - information essentially this is good to
03:06 - read kind of tells you how they got the
03:07 - data what it's from it's not crazy
03:10 - important but I mean kind of tells you
03:11 - what all these attributes are meant for
03:12 - and then attribute information this is
03:16 - like each property of a student right or
03:18 - attribute is obviously the best way to
03:19 - say it and it'll go through what the
03:21 - name of the attribute is and then all of
03:23 - the different values that could be
03:25 - associated with that so for us we're
03:27 - gonna want to deal with integer
03:28 - attributes so already anything that says
03:30 - like male female if we don't want to use
03:32 - these because unless we're going to
03:35 - transfer them transfer them into like a
03:37 - zero or one just can be more difficult
03:39 - later on there's stuff like study time
03:42 - failures like you can read through these
03:43 - and see what they all are and each data
03:45 - set will have astron information
03:46 - typically the most important attributes
03:49 - for us in this data set are gonna be the
03:50 - grades so grade 1 grade 2 and grade 3
03:52 - and pretty much we could just use these
03:55 - two grades to predict what a final grade
03:57 - would be and that would give us a fairly
03:59 - accurate result but I want to make sense
04:00 - some of these other attributes as well
04:02 - and see what we can do with them okay so
04:05 - what's the data we're gonna be using to
04:06 - download that go to data folder go to
04:09 - student zip it'll download the zip for
04:11 - you I already have a download so I'm not
04:12 - gonna do that and then when you open up
04:14 - the zip let's go to my downloads here
04:16 - alright it'll look something like this
04:18 - click on student match and then just
04:20 - drag that into whatever directory you're
04:22 - working ok because you can use this
04:24 - Portuguese one it'll be the exact same
04:25 - process
04:26 - except - PR instead of Matt when you
04:29 - were importing it but this is just a
04:31 - math class to support chi-chi's class
04:33 - I like the math class better personally
04:34 - so that's what I'm gonna use okay so now
04:37 - that we are actually we're in Python so
04:39 - I'm in what you call this here
04:42 - hi charm we're actually going to need to
04:43 - just set up a few things before we can
04:45 - actually start importing our data so in
04:47 - the last tutorial I installed some
04:49 - packages we need to actually install
04:51 - some more packages that I forgot about
04:52 - so excuse me for that but essentially
04:55 - we're gonna activate our environment
04:56 - again - a fresh reminder we can just do
04:59 - activate and then my case I called my
05:01 - tensor so we're gonna do that and I've
05:03 - already done that you can see I because
05:05 - I have tensor right here and we're gonna
05:06 - install some packages so the first thing
05:08 - we need to install is pimp install SK
05:13 - able to learn so I already have it
05:14 - installed but run through that we'll
05:17 - take a second we also need to install
05:18 - numpy and pandas so everyone install
05:21 - pandas this is gonna allow us just to
05:22 - read in our data frames really easily or
05:25 - data sets
05:27 - sorry not frames I gotta keep calling it
05:28 - frames anyways we'll do pip install
05:31 - numpy as well this is just a allows for
05:34 - a raise because all the stuff we do
05:36 - actually needs a raise not list and
05:38 - Python doesn't have general support for
05:41 - raise okay so once we have those
05:44 - installed we can close this terminal and
05:46 - by the way you could have done this from
05:47 - the command prompt as well just by
05:49 - running the terminal it just runs it in
05:51 - the main directory that you're already
05:52 - in so I don't know I just do that cuz
05:53 - it's easier in pycharm but yeah okay so
05:56 - first thing we need to do is read in our
05:58 - data sets you can see already have mine
05:59 - here so do this we're gonna say data
06:01 - equals pandas and I think I actually
06:04 - brought that in as PD so just copy these
06:07 - import statements here
06:08 - PD read CSV and of course that didn't
06:12 - work okay and we'll just do student -
06:15 - Matt dot CSV okay it's gonna read in all
06:19 - our data and since if you actually open
06:21 - this up here and I have it open here you
06:23 - can see that all of our attitudes are
06:25 - actually separated by semicolons now I
06:27 - don't know why they do this because well
06:29 - CSV file stands for comma separated
06:31 - values but to deal with this we're just
06:33 - gonna have to type a CP equals and this
06:36 - to Center separator or delimiter we're
06:39 - gonna do
06:39 - okay and that's what each attribute is
06:41 - separated by so that when we read in our
06:43 - data into a panda's data frame which is
06:46 - what this is actually gonna be called
06:47 - here it gets the correct values okay so
06:50 - now that we've done that what we're
06:52 - gonna do is we're going to set up we're
06:55 - gonna actually trim this data down to
06:57 - what we want it to be or what we need
06:59 - okay
06:59 - so essentially you saw we had those 33
07:02 - attributes I don't want all those 33
07:03 - attributes I only want to use some of
07:05 - them now you guys feel free and please I
07:08 - encourage you to do this mess around
07:10 - with the different attributes that
07:11 - you're using if you want to just test it
07:14 - out use the same ones as me first but
07:15 - then add some of your own remove some
07:17 - see if you can get your accuracy level
07:18 - up by using different ones maybe even
07:20 - use them all you know what I mean see
07:22 - what you can really do with them okay
07:24 - but essentially what we're gonna do here
07:25 - is I'm gonna say something called X
07:27 - actually no we're gonna say data equals
07:30 - data okay and then in here we're gonna
07:34 - put a another little list thing and
07:37 - we're just gonna type in the attribute
07:38 - so we actually want so in this case I'm
07:40 - gonna go G 1 G 2 G 3 I'm gonna do study
07:46 - time okay and what else should we do
07:50 - let's say here study time and I'm just
07:53 - gonna come out of the screen here see
07:54 - what else we had Oh absences and
07:56 - failures okay and these are you can see
07:58 - the list of attributes obviously if you
08:00 - go to that website that I was showing
08:01 - you unfortunately I closed it and then
08:04 - you can see what all of them actually
08:06 - mean try to pick ones that only have
08:07 - integer values associated with them
08:09 - because it'll make your life a bit
08:10 - easier but if you for some reason pick
08:12 - one that doesn't have an a value integer
08:14 - value you're gonna have to change all of
08:16 - the values within this data frame so
08:18 - that they're integer so they can
08:19 - actually work with the thing that we're
08:21 - gonna be using okay all right so these
08:23 - are our attributes and you know I'm
08:24 - actually just gonna show you what our
08:26 - data frame looks like when we print it
08:28 - out because I think it's kind of
08:29 - interesting so if you do data dot head
08:31 - this is gonna grab the first five
08:32 - elements of our data frame and print
08:34 - them out to the screen and just show us
08:36 - what they look like so before I change
08:38 - and manipulate the data I'm just gonna
08:39 - print the head out here so I'll just run
08:41 - this quick they already have a
08:42 - configuration set up and you can see
08:44 - that's showing us all these different
08:45 - attributes can't show us all of them
08:47 - because there's enough room in the
08:47 - console and then what their values
08:50 - actually are equal to okay that's kind
08:52 - of what our
08:53 - data frame looks like and then if I want
08:55 - to I can copy this and well paste this
08:57 - down here and you can see what the
08:58 - difference is now with our data frame so
09:01 - you can see we've cut down from five by
09:03 - thirty three columns - it doesn't say
09:05 - does it well it's anyways we've cut down
09:08 - to however many attributes this is which
09:10 - is six okay so now we're gonna define
09:13 - what we are trying to predict so what
09:16 - value is it that we actually want in
09:17 - this case we want G three and G three
09:19 - stands for their final grade it's really
09:21 - predict equals and then just in this
09:24 - case we'll type the attribute name which
09:25 - is G three and this is where I'm now
09:27 - gonna go into talking about attributes
09:29 - and labels see what time we're at nine
09:31 - minutes okay well go for another few
09:32 - minutes before I cut and go to the next
09:34 - video but essentially everything here is
09:37 - known as an attribute right it's part of
09:39 - a student and it's unique to each
09:42 - student like these attitudes right and
09:43 - labels are what we want to get based on
09:47 - attributes so in this case our label is
09:50 - actually going to be known as g3 because
09:52 - based on all these different attributes
09:54 - we want to determine what g3 is now yes
09:58 - I know I have g3 in here and it is still
10:00 - an attribute but we're gonna remove that
10:02 - when we are actually testing and
10:04 - training this data set okay so this
10:07 - predict is also known as a label you may
10:10 - hear people say that essentially label
10:12 - is what you're trying to get right what
10:14 - you're looking for and you could have
10:16 - multiple labels and you can predict
10:17 - multiple labels and you can also predict
10:19 - what do you call it you could have like
10:21 - a ton of different attributes you don't
10:23 - want attribute it's it's a you can
10:25 - change it around it's all variable okay
10:26 - so now that we've done that what I'm
10:27 - actually gonna do is I'm gonna set up
10:29 - two arrays and one array is going to
10:31 - define all of our attributes and one is
10:33 - going to be our label or it labels if we
10:35 - had multiple so and this case I'm going
10:36 - to say X is equal to and I think we're
10:39 - gonna do NP dot array so we're gonna set
10:42 - this up in an array because it's we're
10:43 - gonna have to use and we're gonna
10:44 - actually just do data dot drop and in
10:47 - this case I think this is what you do
10:49 - for it at least we're gonna drop g3 so
10:52 - essentially what this actually does for
10:55 - us and actually I need to do this I
10:58 - think based on what I'm looking at here
11:00 - so g3 but we actually just use predict
11:02 - so this is more optimized if we're gonna
11:05 - change what we're trying to predict
11:06 - but essentially what we're doing here
11:08 - right is this is gonna return to us a
11:09 - new data frame and these are what these
11:11 - are all called right it just doesn't
11:13 - have g3 in it because this is gonna be
11:15 - all our training data and then based on
11:17 - that training down we're gonna try to
11:18 - predict like another value right okay
11:20 - so X and then Y is gonna be all of our
11:23 - labels whereas this is all of our
11:25 - features or attributes okay so what
11:27 - we're gonna do now is gonna do MP dot
11:29 - array and then here it's going to go to
11:31 - data and between Fred data we're just
11:35 - gonna do data and then predict in here
11:39 - because we only care about the actual g3
11:42 - value here okay let me just check yeah
11:44 - that is correct
11:45 - okay so how do that X&Y now what we're
11:48 - gonna do is we're actually going to
11:50 - split these up into four variables we're
11:53 - gonna have X test Y test X train and why
11:57 - train okay and not in that order but
11:58 - you'll see in a second so when do X
12:00 - underscore train Y underscore the Train
12:05 - not equal so greater than side whatever
12:08 - that is and we'll have X underscore test
12:10 - and Y underscore test this is going to
12:13 - be equal to howdy
12:15 - what is this command SK learn dot linear
12:19 - model or model selection actually dot
12:23 - train test splits just give me all those
12:25 - which is very nice and in this case what
12:27 - we're gonna pass we're gonna pass XY and
12:29 - then for what is this value actually
12:32 - called
12:33 - just gotta have a look at my other
12:34 - screen test size that's what it is test
12:37 - underscore size is equal to zero point
12:40 - one okay so let's talk about what this
12:42 - is doing essentially we're taking our
12:44 - all of our attributes and all of our
12:46 - labels or whatever we're trying to
12:48 - predict and we're gonna split them up
12:50 - now into four different arrays so we
12:53 - have X train and Y Trina X train is
12:55 - gonna be a section of this array Y train
12:59 - is going to be a section of this array
13:00 - and then we're gonna have these test
13:02 - data then we're gonna use to test the
13:04 - accuracy of our model that we're gonna
13:06 - create or of our algorithm all right
13:08 - now the way this works essentially is
13:10 - because if we trained the model off of
13:13 - every single bit of data that we have
13:16 - and then it would simply just memorize
13:18 - patterns right because computers
13:20 - memorize things like amazingly so think
13:22 - about it kind of in a way say you like
13:25 - you're in class right and oh actually
13:28 - Kay that's about example but let's just
13:29 - say this right if we train the model off
13:31 - of the data we're gonna test it on it's
13:33 - already seen that information so it
13:35 - already knows what the answer to that
13:36 - question is or to that prediction so we
13:39 - can't train the model off of our testing
13:41 - data otherwise we're gonna get
13:43 - inaccurate results because it's gonna be
13:45 - able to pretty well get perfect because
13:46 - it's already seen that information so
13:47 - essentially what this does is we're
13:49 - splitting up 10% of our data into test
13:52 - samples so that when we test we can test
13:55 - off of that and it's never seen that
13:57 - information before hope that makes sense
13:59 - you and this is just what this whole
14:01 - mess of code is doing for us all right
14:02 - test size and X&Y is just taking our
14:05 - labels and features or attributes or
14:07 - whatever okay and I think I'm actually
14:09 - gonna cut the video here in the next
14:12 - video we're gonna go into actually
14:13 - applying this into an algorithm talking
14:14 - about how that algorithm works
14:16 - mathematically and then maybe I'm not
14:19 - sure if it'll be in the next video or
14:20 - the one after that we'll do predictions
14:21 - and so on with that okay so if you guys
14:23 - enjoyed the video please make sure you

14:25 - want exclusive updates on the next
14:27 - machine learning videos are coming out

14:32 - the information for this anyways I'll
