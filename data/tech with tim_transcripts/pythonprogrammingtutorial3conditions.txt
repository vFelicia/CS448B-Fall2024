00:01 - hey guys uh welcome back to the third
00:03 - video in my Python Programming tutorial
00:05 - series um today we're going to be
00:07 - talking about something called
00:08 - conditions so I hope you remember from
00:10 - the other videos we talked about input
00:13 - printing we did variables data types and
00:16 - then we talked about operators so
00:18 - operators like plus minus um division
00:21 - integer division modulus right uh
00:24 - multiplication all those operators today
00:27 - we're going to be talking about a few
00:28 - more operators and then getting into
00:30 - conditions so here in my file right here
00:34 - um I've put down four basic comparison
00:37 - operators so pretty much a comparison is
00:40 - something that's going to return a value
00:41 - of true or false so here we have um
00:44 - let's say if a real world example is Tim
00:48 - equal to Joe well no they're not because
00:52 - Tim obviously spelled differently than
00:54 - Joe so that's going to be giving us a
00:56 - value of false um same thing if we want
00:58 - to go into numbers we say is 18 is
01:01 - greater than 2 well is that true yes it
01:05 - is so that condition gives us a value of
01:08 - true uh it's a very simple concept but
01:10 - it's something that we have to
01:11 - understand as we go into decisions later
01:14 - on which will be in the next
01:16 - video okay so these comparison operators
01:18 - I'll read them off and just kind of give
01:20 - a definition of each of them so the
01:21 - first one can e be a less than or
01:23 - greater than sign uh same thing with the
01:25 - second one right so it's just going to
01:28 - compare if something's less than greater
01:29 - than then um usually these are used for
01:32 - integer values um that data type uh we
01:36 - also can use them for Strings but it's a
01:38 - little more complex and I'm not going to
01:40 - get into that right now maybe in a more
01:41 - advanced tutorial later on now the
01:45 - equivalent operator so the equal sign
01:47 - here now a lot of people think well if
01:49 - I'm comparing something why wouldn't I
01:51 - just use one equal sign like this well
01:54 - that's a very good question and a lot of
01:55 - people get mixed up on this it is
01:57 - actually two equal signs that's because
01:59 - because in Python um the one equal sign
02:02 - is a declaration um declaration operator
02:07 - so for example if I put a variable X and
02:09 - I want to set it equal to four right um
02:13 - this is what we do with the one equal
02:16 - sign we're setting values right so when
02:17 - we did name is equal to Tim things like
02:21 - that we're using one equal sign now if
02:23 - we're going to check something we're
02:25 - going to compare them we have to use two
02:27 - because two equal signs and one equal
02:29 - sign have a very different meaning so
02:31 - it's important to keep that in mind that
02:33 - the comparison operator for equivalency
02:35 - is two equal signs okay the next one is
02:39 - not equal to um so we have an
02:41 - exclamation mark and then we have the
02:44 - equal sign like this okay so an example
02:47 - of not equal to because some people may
02:48 - get confused here say if four not equal
02:52 - to 5 oops what did I type
02:55 - there not equal to 5 okay so what do you
03:00 - think this would give us just think
03:01 - about it for a
03:03 - second well what it's actually going to
03:05 - return to us is true because the
03:08 - condition is if four is not equal to 5
03:14 - and here we can see obviously four is
03:16 - not equal to 5 so now again if I give
03:18 - another example we put five here we say
03:20 - five not equal to 5 well that would
03:22 - return a value of false because five is
03:26 - indeed equal to five now we can do the
03:29 - same thing with strings so for example
03:31 - we have hello oops spelled incorrectly
03:34 - there we go
03:36 - and Tim uh now you can probably guess by
03:40 - yourself that this is going to return
03:42 - true because Tim is indeed not equal to
03:46 - hello okay uh it's pretty
03:48 - straightforward um but a lot of people
03:50 - may get mixed up with the not equal to
03:52 - if it's returning true or
03:54 - false okay so those are the four basic
03:56 - comparison operators that we're going to
03:58 - use so we have equal to uh not equal to
04:00 - and then greater than and less than so
04:03 - greater than and less than again we use
04:04 - for numbers so 1 less than two again
04:08 - that's going to return true like that
04:10 - okay so now um we're going to start
04:13 - printing them some things to the console
04:15 - and maybe doing a little bit of a quiz
04:17 - here um just to see how you guys are
04:20 - going to do so a booing condition I'm
04:23 - going to store it in a variable so I'm
04:24 - going to say name uh oops actually we're
04:27 - not going to do that we're just going to
04:27 - print to the console
04:30 - 2 less than
04:32 - three okay now you guys guess and uh
04:36 - tell me what you think is going to be
04:38 - returned to the console it's either
04:39 - going to be true or false I'll give you
04:41 - a hint right
04:44 - now now it gives us a value of true
04:47 - that's because this condition 2 is less
04:49 - than three um is true it's equal to
04:53 - three right um so now if we switch the
04:55 - sign and we make it greater than like
04:58 - that well you can get guess what's going
05:00 - to come up so we click enter and we get
05:03 - false that's because this condition
05:05 - returns a value of
05:07 - false okay now we'll do another
05:10 - condition here all right um
05:13 - hello equal
05:16 - to Hilo okay um and guess yourself what
05:21 - this one's going to return false okay
05:24 - that's because they are spelled
05:25 - differently um now we're going to do the
05:27 - not equal sign just to show that one as
05:29 - well hello not equal to hello and we'll
05:32 - see that gives us true because they are
05:34 - not the same um fairly straightforward
05:37 - but a lot of people do get these things
05:39 - mixed up now I'll show you what happens
05:41 - when I try to just do one equal sign
05:43 - like
05:45 - this see we get keyword can't be an
05:48 - expression that's because we're trying
05:51 - to declare a variable here but we cannot
05:54 - do that okay because we're just using
05:56 - one equal sign here we need to use two
05:58 - all right
06:00 - okay so now let's try another example
06:02 - maybe a more advanced one uh this is a
06:04 - little bit of a trick okay I want to see
06:06 - if you guys remember from my last
06:07 - tutorial what I talked
06:12 - about so take a guess right now what you
06:14 - think is going to be return you think
06:15 - it's going to be true or do you think
06:16 - it's going to be
06:17 - false well it was false okay um that's
06:21 - because again what we talked about in
06:23 - Python um capitals matter right so any
06:27 - capital letter is different than a
06:28 - lowercase letter so something like this
06:31 - um yeah it's going to return false all
06:34 - right it's important to understand that
06:36 - okay so we've very briefly uh gone into
06:39 - conditions now um I'm going to write a
06:40 - few on the side here you guys can go
06:42 - ahead um I'll put them in print
06:43 - statements and test yourself and see if
06:46 - you get them right or not
06:49 - okay I'm going to add a few tricks from
06:51 - the other lesson um try to kind of apply
06:54 - some of our
06:55 - knowledge and
06:57 - see if we can get them correct
07:01 - okay so just give me a minute here I'm
07:03 - just going to write a few
07:08 - out and then we'll go through the
07:10 - answers afterwards okay so you know what
07:12 - we'll just we'll just do these ones for
07:14 - right now and we'll do a few other
07:15 - examples okay so these are a little more
07:16 - advanced than what I was talking about
07:18 - before but they are conditions we have a
07:20 - left side of the condition and we have a
07:22 - right side of the con condition so I
07:24 - hope you've taken a guess now of what
07:25 - you think these are going to be because
07:26 - I'm about to print out the answer right
07:28 - now Okay so we've gotten true false and
07:32 - false all right so for the first one two
07:35 - less than three that's an example I
07:36 - already gave that gives us a value of
07:39 - true because that condition is true uh
07:42 - now we have 2 - 3 + 4 greater then five
07:46 - um so you can do the math there and see
07:48 - that that is going to be false and then
07:51 - this one some people may have gotten a
07:53 - little bit of a little bit confused on
07:55 - cuz I actually use the words false and
07:57 - true in my condition that's going to
08:00 - return false or true so I have print
08:02 - false equals equals true well is false
08:05 - the same thing as true no it's not so
08:07 - obviously we're going to be returned
08:08 - with the value
08:10 - false Okay so we've talked a little bit
08:12 - about conditions now um in the next
08:15 - tutorial we're going to be doing
08:16 - something called decision so I'll give
08:17 - you a sneak peek on what that
08:20 - is something like this
08:23 - okay so stay tuned for that um the next
08:26 - episode should be up tomorrow um um and
08:29 - yeah I hope you guys enjoyed the video
08:31 - go ahead like And subscribe and yeah
08:34 - share with your friends thanks bye
