00:00 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:01 - python curses tutorial in this video i'm
00:04 - going to be showing you a few extra
00:06 - functions that we haven't yet looked at
00:08 - this should be pretty short i'm just
00:09 - going to cover a few interesting things
00:10 - that you can do now i will note before
00:12 - we dive in here that i will leave the
00:14 - curses documentation in the description
00:16 - there is a ton of stuff that you can do
00:18 - i cannot possibly cover all of this in
00:20 - this series and the stuff i've showed
00:22 - you so far is probably the most
00:24 - important and the stuff you're going to
00:25 - use most commonly anyways with that said
00:27 - let's dive in
00:31 - [Music]
00:37 - alright so in front of me here i have
00:38 - the curses documentation now i just
00:40 - wanted to quickly scroll through this to
00:42 - show you that there is a ton of stuff so
00:44 - please do look at this if you're looking
00:46 - for more features from curses obviously
00:48 - as i was saying i can't cover all of
00:50 - this and it will be in the description
00:52 - anyways what i'm going to do now is hop
00:54 - over to my code you notice i have a
00:56 - similar example to what i had in the
00:58 - previous video except now i just have a
01:00 - rectangle that i'm drawing on the screen
01:02 - and i'm going to show you how we can
01:03 - change the color of the rectangle so if
01:06 - i go here and i run my codes let's go
01:07 - python tutorial 5 dot pi notice we get a
01:10 - rectangle i hit enter and then we get it
01:13 - now let's see how we can change the
01:15 - color of this so there's actually a
01:17 - method that we haven't looked at yet and
01:19 - this is going to be on our std screen
01:21 - called dot and then i believe this is
01:23 - adder and on uh now what this does is
01:26 - turn an attribute so either bold or a
01:29 - specific color on or off so i can turn
01:32 - on for example like the blue and yellow
01:34 - color and then that means that my
01:36 - rectangle will be drawn in blue and
01:38 - yellow and anything else that i do will
01:39 - be drawn with blue and yellow until i
01:42 - turn that attribute off so it's kind of
01:44 - a semi-permanent way to declare an
01:46 - attribute rather than adding it to the
01:48 - actual i guess add
01:50 - string method that we saw previously so
01:52 - for now i'm just going to put
01:54 - blue and yellow and then i'm going to
01:56 - make sure that i turn this off after i
01:58 - draw the rectangles i'm going to say
02:00 - adder and then this will be off like
02:02 - this and i think i need to put
02:05 - blue and yellow as well to disable this
02:07 - specific attribute because i could turn
02:08 - multiple attributes on at the same time
02:10 - anyways let's see what this does now by
02:12 - running our code and notice that we're
02:14 - going to get a blue and yellow rectangle
02:16 - right so we have yellow as kind of the
02:18 - border color and then we have blue as
02:20 - the actual i guess outline for the
02:22 - rectangle okay then when i hit enter we
02:24 - are done okay so that's nice let's see
02:26 - what happens when we turn on say just a
02:29 - color i'm actually interested to see if
02:30 - this is going to work or not i'm going
02:32 - to go curses and then color underscore
02:34 - red
02:35 - rather than a color pair and i just want
02:37 - to see if this is going to work i'm not
02:39 - actually certain here i haven't tried
02:40 - this yet but let's give it a shot so
02:42 - let's try to turn on just one color
02:44 - let's go python tutorial 5 and notice it
02:46 - actually doesn't do anything so i guess
02:48 - that didn't work just me turning on
02:50 - individual color i do need to add the
02:52 - color pair now if i don't want that kind
02:54 - of outline right or that highlighting of
02:57 - the rectangle i would just need to make
02:58 - the background black so let's just use
03:00 - the green and black color pair and see
03:03 - if this is going to look any better so
03:04 - let's go
03:05 - green and black like that
03:08 - let's run the code and now notice we are
03:10 - getting our green rectangle perfect now
03:13 - just to prove to you here i'm just going
03:14 - to add a string to the screen so i'm
03:16 - going to say this dot add string
03:19 - let's add hello world let's add this at
03:22 - maybe 5 10 or let's go 5 30
03:26 - okay and then we don't actually want to
03:28 - add an attribute to i just want to see
03:30 - if this is going to show up green and
03:31 - black so let's run this
03:33 - go here
03:35 - and run and notice we have the green
03:36 - string because that attribute was on and
03:39 - then one more example here if we turn
03:40 - off the attribute before we add the
03:43 - string we should see that it just adds
03:44 - in the default color so let's run this
03:47 - now and notice it does add in the
03:49 - default color okay so that's useful add
03:51 - attribute or attribute on and attribute
03:53 - off now i'm going to show you how we can
03:55 - add a border to the screen so to add a
03:57 - border to the screen is i guess useful
03:59 - as well what you can do is std screen
04:01 - like that dot and then i believe this is
04:04 - just going to be border
04:05 - now if i just add a border all it's
04:07 - going to do is add a rectangular border
04:08 - around the screen so let's have a look
04:10 - at how this works
04:12 - let's go here and notice we have a white
04:14 - border now if i wanted a different color
04:16 - border what i would need to do is add
04:18 - the attribute before i draw the border
04:20 - now i also can specify what the border
04:22 - is made of
04:24 - i'll see if i can actually find this in
04:25 - the documentation because i can't
04:27 - remember exactly what it is so if we go
04:29 - to border notice it's saying we have the
04:31 - left side the right side the top side
04:33 - the bottom side uh the top left corner
04:35 - the top right corner the bottom left
04:36 - corner and the bottom right hand corner
04:39 - you can read what this means and how you
04:42 - change these i just wanted to mention
04:44 - that you can actually change what the
04:45 - border is made of
04:47 - but what i want to do here is change the
04:49 - color of the border so i'm going to add
04:51 - an attribute here
04:53 - and let's just make this
04:55 - orange and white for now
04:57 - again it's called orange and white it
04:59 - really should be red and white so let's
05:01 - change this to red and white so let's
05:03 - make this red and white okay so red and
05:05 - white
05:07 - oh why am i putting that in there okay i
05:08 - wanted to turn it off so let's put this
05:11 - down below
05:12 - and let's go adder off okay so we're
05:15 - going to turn the red and white on we're
05:16 - going to draw the border and then turn
05:18 - off and then we'll go with this
05:20 - okay so let's run this and notice red is
05:23 - not defined oh i didn't want to have red
05:26 - inside of there my bad let's try this
05:28 - again and notice we're going to get our
05:30 - white and red border we then have our
05:32 - green rectangle and everything is
05:34 - working as we expected all right so now
05:36 - that we have looked at how we add the
05:38 - border the last thing i'm going to show
05:39 - you is how we change the cursor location
05:41 - on the screen which is something we want
05:43 - to do
05:44 - sometimes so to do this what we actually
05:47 - do is we use our screen and then we say
05:50 - dot move now this allows us to move the
05:52 - cursor to whatever location we would
05:53 - like now i'm actually just going to move
05:55 - it after i add all of this stuff
05:57 - so let's move it and then let's just go
06:00 - to a position like
06:01 - maybe 10 20 just so it's pretty clear to
06:04 - see where this is so this allows us
06:06 - again just to move the cursor so let's
06:08 - run this and notice that now my cursor
06:10 - is over here rather than at the end of
06:13 - this line which is the last line that i
06:15 - trim so that's how you move the cursor
06:17 - and i said that was the last thing i was
06:18 - going to show you but i will show you
06:19 - one more thing here which actually
06:22 - allows you to view the keystrokes that
06:24 - someone is typing
06:25 - so to do this what you need to do is do
06:28 - the std screen like this dot and then i
06:30 - believe it's going to be echo and inside
06:33 - of here i'm going to put true now what
06:35 - this does is it actually tells the the
06:38 - screen to echo the keystrokes that the
06:40 - user types now i'm just going to go
06:42 - inside of here and say wow true
06:45 - and i'm going to say that the key is
06:48 - equal to this dot get key and i just
06:50 - need a way to exit out so i'm just going
06:52 - to say if the key
06:53 - is equal to q then we will break
06:56 - otherwise though this should just show
06:58 - what we type on the screen this might
06:59 - not be the exact right command but let's
07:01 - try this for right now
07:02 - and see if this is going to work
07:04 - we might have to refresh the screen as
07:05 - well not quite sure let's run this
07:07 - though and see
07:08 - okay so there's no object called echo
07:11 - interested why that's happening let me
07:13 - just have a look and i'll be right back
07:15 - all right so looks like it's actually
07:16 - not this it's going to be curses.echo
07:19 - and i don't think i actually even need
07:21 - to add true there so when i do this it
07:23 - should initialize curses to show me the
07:25 - text
07:27 - let's try this now and notice that if i
07:29 - start typing something in i can now
07:30 - actually see the text that i'm typing in
07:32 - so hello my name is tim and then of
07:34 - course i can hit q here
07:36 - and then that will end the program so if
07:38 - you want to see the text the user types
07:40 - in that you need to do curses.echo that
07:42 - doesn't mean that we're going to easily
07:44 - be able to see it because if you don't
07:46 - wait for the user to type in a key then
07:48 - the program's just going to immediately
07:49 - end so you do need to handle it in kind
07:50 - of the way that i'm doing right here
07:52 - anyways that is what echo does and of
07:54 - course
07:55 - if i remove this so i comment that out
07:57 - and then i go here and i start typing
07:59 - you can see nothing's going to happen
08:01 - and when i hit q then we exit okay so
08:04 - that is pretty much all i had for this
08:06 - video again this is the documentation
08:08 - this is what i've been referencing the
08:09 - entire time feel free to read through
08:11 - this there is a ton of awesome stuff and
08:14 - hopefully this video helped you out if
