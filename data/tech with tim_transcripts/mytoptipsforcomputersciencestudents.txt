00:00 - many of you know that I finished 5 out
00:01 - of eight of the semesters in my computer
00:03 - science degree before I eventually
00:05 - dropped out when I dropped out I had a
00:06 - 9.2 GPA I was one of the top in my
00:09 - program and the reason I had such high
00:11 - grades was because I followed this kind
00:13 - of regimen and did these tips and tricks
00:15 - first of all I only did High leverage
00:17 - activities that means if I felt like a
00:19 - professor wasn't teaching me effectively
00:20 - I didn't go to their lectures if I
00:22 - thought a tutorial was a waste of time I
00:24 - didn't go to the tutorial I simply spent
00:26 - time at home learning the content on my
00:28 - own or watching YouTube videos of people
00:30 - that were more qualified to teach the
00:32 - material I only did activities where I
00:34 - could actually see a tangible benefit in
00:36 - my learning for example I would never
00:37 - rewrite a note I would never even hand
00:39 - write notes all I would do is things
00:41 - that actually helped me learn the
00:43 - content and the way that I evaluated
00:45 - that was by doing a ton of practice
00:46 - questions and focusing on practice exams
00:49 - and tests so I was only learning the
00:51 - type of material that was actually going
00:52 - to be on some kind of assessment
