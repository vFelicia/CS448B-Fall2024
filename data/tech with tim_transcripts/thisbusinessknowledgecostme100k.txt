00:03 - foreign
00:08 - I'm going to share with you all of the
00:11 - business knowledge I've obtained over
00:12 - the past five years that's costing about
00:14 - a hundred thousand dollars now a lot of
00:17 - you may see me as just a programmer a
00:19 - YouTuber or some kind of simplistic
00:20 - title but the reality is I've been
00:22 - running companies for the past three
00:24 - years I am a part owner or a complete
00:26 - owner of multiple corporations I have
00:29 - all kinds of funds moving all over the
00:30 - place all the time and I am very very
00:32 - concerned about reducing and deferring
00:34 - taxes and with that comes some complex
00:37 - structures so in this video I'm going to
00:39 - share with you a ton of nuance and a lot
00:41 - of detail about what it's like to
00:43 - actually run multiple companies how you
00:45 - control a relatively High income and
00:47 - make sure you don't pay a massive amount
00:49 - in taxes how you access corporate funds
00:52 - personally how you do all kinds of stuff
00:54 - that I never see people talk about and
00:56 - that is very very important that I've
00:57 - had to pay a lot of money to learn over
01:00 - the past few years this money has been
01:02 - paid to accountants lawyers bookkeepers
01:04 - investment professionals advisors and
01:07 - all the other people that you can
01:08 - imagine so with that said sit back relax
01:10 - and let me share with you everything
01:12 - that I know for free
01:15 - [Music]
01:20 - video by sharing with you a piece of
01:22 - mindset that's important for a
01:23 - successful entrepreneur and that's
01:25 - related to opportunity specifically
01:27 - taking advantage of opportunity and kind
01:29 - of searching out in the marketplace for
01:31 - it now to give you a prime example I'm
01:33 - going to take the opportunity to share
01:35 - with you that I just released a brand
01:36 - new course called blockchain expert if
01:38 - you're interested in web 3 blockchain
01:40 - technology you want to learn more about
01:42 - how this works and potentially become a
01:44 - blockchain engineer or web3 developer
01:46 - check it out from the link in the
01:47 - description and use discount code Tim
01:49 - now in all seriousness guys what I'm
01:51 - going to share with you in this video is
01:53 - really everything you need to know about
01:55 - kind of more complex corporate
01:57 - structures so having multiple
01:58 - corporations like a holding company how
02:00 - you can use a trust to kind of prepare
02:02 - for a liquidation event or a sale of a
02:04 - company how you can invest funds within
02:07 - a company how you can control your
02:08 - income defer your taxes and access funds
02:11 - from your corporation when you need them
02:13 - personally this is going to go a lot
02:15 - further than you know oh set up a
02:16 - corporation because it reduces liability
02:18 - or oh you don't a sole proprietor I'm
02:20 - going to give you all of the nuanced
02:22 - details that often aren't shared in
02:24 - videos like this so with that said let's
02:26 - Dive In
02:28 - [Music]
02:32 - all right so let me Begin by outlining
02:34 - the kind of main goals that you should
02:36 - have as an entrepreneur when it comes to
02:38 - business and when it comes to these
02:39 - different structures that I'm going to
02:40 - talk about now goal number one I hope
02:42 - for most of you as an entrepreneur is to
02:44 - make as much money as possible right I
02:47 - absolutely want to do that anyone who
02:48 - tells you they don't want to do that is
02:50 - probably lying and that's why I have
02:51 - this YouTube channel I sell products I'm
02:53 - a part owner in another company that's a
02:55 - startup right now
02:56 - Etc I want to make as much money as
02:58 - possible that's cool number one goal
02:59 - number two is to keep as much money as
03:01 - possible it doesn't matter how much
03:03 - money you make if you keep none of it
03:05 - and this highly involves paying the
03:07 - least amount of money in tax as possible
03:09 - or deferring your taxes until a very far
03:12 - uh kind of point in the future ideally
03:14 - you want to keep as much money as you
03:16 - possibly can that could mean saving
03:18 - money that also typically means saving
03:20 - money on taxes which is really one of
03:22 - the main purposes of all these kinds of
03:24 - structures Now goal number three is to
03:27 - reduce your liability specifically
03:29 - personally also in a corporation you
03:31 - want to make sure sure that if you or
03:33 - ever to be sued if something kind of
03:35 - traumatic were to happen that you would
03:37 - not lose a massive amount of money you
03:38 - want to protect your assets and protect
03:40 - your funds goal number four would be to
03:43 - have flexibility right be able to take
03:45 - out money when you need it spend money
03:47 - when you want to go and buy an expensive
03:48 - car go buy a house kind of do what you
03:51 - need to or do what you want to and have
03:53 - the flexibility to access your funds
03:54 - from multiple places so those are the
03:56 - four goals at least that I have I hope
03:59 - that you guys have those goals as well
04:00 - keep those in mind sorry as we go to the
04:02 - Future sections in this video
04:05 - [Music]
04:08 - so in this next section I quickly want
04:11 - to talk about the different legal
04:12 - entities you want to be concerned with
04:13 - and the informational is the basics you
04:15 - want to know about it so when we're
04:17 - talking about legal entities we have our
04:19 - sole proprietorship we have our
04:20 - Corporation we have Partnerships we have
04:22 - not-for-profits we have other more
04:24 - complex structures that I don't need to
04:26 - discuss for 99 of you here you're going
04:29 - to be concerned about sole
04:30 - proprietorship and Corporation now when
04:32 - I say corporation that could be an LLC
04:34 - if you're in the US I'm in Canada but
04:36 - most of what I'm going to say here
04:37 - applies to the US and North America in
04:40 - general okay so sole proprietorship
04:42 - Corporation I know many of you know this
04:44 - stuff but when you're a sole proprietor
04:46 - that means you don't have kind of a
04:48 - formal legal entity you're operating
04:50 - kind of under your own name maybe you
04:52 - have a business name I don't know
04:53 - exactly how that works but the idea is
04:55 - that all of your kind of personal stuff
04:57 - and business stuff are kind of mixed
04:58 - together in a sense if you were to ever
05:00 - get sued as a sole proprietor you would
05:01 - be personally liable let's say you got
05:03 - sued for a million dollars and you had a
05:05 - house well you would have to sell that
05:06 - house pay that million dollars okay so
05:09 - the liability is atrocious when you're a
05:11 - sole proprietor and the taxes are very
05:13 - poor as well because you're not able to
05:15 - control your income and you get kind of
05:17 - double taxed on payroll taxes which we
05:19 - can talk about in a future section
05:21 - anyways sole proprietor not ideal
05:24 - however it does make sense if you're
05:25 - making a very small amount of money and
05:27 - you don't want to pay the fees
05:28 - associated with a corporation if you're
05:30 - not concerned with liability no issue
05:32 - being a sole proprietor but if you start
05:34 - making more than 50 60 70 grand a year
05:36 - you probably want to consider
05:38 - transitioning into some type of
05:39 - corporate structure okay next
05:42 - Corporation Corporation has limited
05:44 - liability it's not completely unlimited
05:47 - it means that you could potentially be
05:49 - personally liable but it's a lot less
05:51 - likely depending on how you set things
05:53 - up in a corporation you have much more
05:55 - control over your income and taxes
05:58 - typically you're going to pay much less
05:59 - in taxes and be able to retain more
06:02 - money within your corporation there is
06:04 - various other benefits as well but those
06:06 - are the main ones you need to be aware
06:08 - of so for most of you you have to think
06:09 - to yourself right now does it make sense
06:11 - for me to be a corporation really this
06:13 - answer is going to require some legal
06:15 - advice talking to an accountant or
06:17 - lawyer but I wouldn't even bother paying
06:18 - the consultation fee unless you're going
06:20 - to be making again 60 70 80 grand per
06:23 - year or more or you think you're going
06:25 - to be at that point uh relatively soon
06:27 - in the future
06:29 - [Music]
06:33 - all right so moving on here let's say
06:35 - that you've decided you're going to be a
06:36 - corporation or you already are a
06:38 - corporation you have a company or some
06:40 - kind of corporate entity now what you
06:42 - need to consider is what it takes to
06:44 - operate a corporation so I'm going to
06:46 - share with you kind of what my operation
06:48 - of the corporation looks like relative
06:50 - fees and costs associated with that and
06:53 - keep in mind that at this point in time
06:54 - my Corporation is not I wouldn't say
06:57 - it's complex it's just me I'm the only
06:58 - uh kind of director and owner of the
07:00 - corporation but I have a significant
07:01 - amount of transactions and a very high
07:03 - level of income in the corporation so
07:06 - it's not you know Corpus making 100
07:07 - Grand a year it's making multiple
07:09 - hundreds of thousands of dollars per
07:10 - year has Investments has some more
07:12 - complexity so mine is going to be a bit
07:14 - more expensive than someone just
07:16 - starting out would be okay so operating
07:19 - Corporation what do you need well first
07:20 - of all you need your minute books to be
07:22 - taken care of now the minute books
07:24 - essentially keep track of any share
07:25 - operations ownership operations stuff
07:28 - related to directors I don't even really
07:30 - know exactly what happens in the minute
07:31 - books I let my lawyer take care of that
07:33 - but every year your lawyer needs to
07:35 - update the minute books that's going to
07:37 - be a few hundred dollars so keep that in
07:39 - mind and this these minute book story
07:40 - need to be stored typically in a
07:42 - physical location at some law office I
07:45 - actually just had mine transferred here
07:46 - to Nova Scotia because I just moved from
07:48 - Toronto to kind of Halifax now okay next
07:51 - you're gonna have your bookkeeping now
07:53 - this bookkeeping could be done solely at
07:55 - the end of the year before you prepare
07:56 - your end of your financial statements
07:58 - but typically you're going to want a
08:00 - bookkeeper at least quarterly to go in
08:02 - update your books make sure you have
08:05 - some kind of idea and picture of the
08:07 - financials of your company you know all
08:09 - of the income you know all of the
08:11 - expenses you know your balance sheet
08:13 - what assets you have the depreciation on
08:15 - those and you want an accountant to be
08:16 - doing this right which is a bookkeeper
08:19 - my bookkeeper costs about 225 dollars
08:21 - per month goes in once per month updates
08:24 - everything this is very valuable to me
08:26 - because I like to see this I like to
08:27 - look at my books and I like to be able
08:29 - to analyze all of my expenses and my
08:32 - income and understand okay where am I
08:33 - making money where am I losing money
08:35 - where can I cut expenses where can I
08:37 - increase revenue and what activity
08:38 - should be should I be focusing on that's
08:41 - bringing in the most amount of money to
08:43 - the corporation so you want a bookkeeper
08:45 - most of you can do this quarterly again
08:47 - it's probably gonna be about 200 bucks
08:48 - 250 bucks a month depending on the
08:51 - volume of transactions that you have
08:53 - next yearly statements these are the
08:56 - most important so as a private
08:58 - Corporation as many of you know you need
08:59 - to file every single year you need to
09:01 - submit your profit and loss you need to
09:03 - submit your balance sheet you need to
09:05 - submit anything related to the change in
09:07 - directors or ownership
09:09 - Etc right I don't know exactly what you
09:10 - need to file my accountants do all of
09:12 - this for me but it's something along
09:13 - those lines okay so you need to have
09:15 - professional help doing this for you or
09:17 - you have to completely know what you're
09:19 - doing even myself knowing quite a bit
09:21 - about this I would not trust myself to
09:23 - file my own corporate returns I pay my
09:25 - accountant at the end of the year it's
09:27 - usually about fifteen hundred dollars
09:28 - for them to file and prepare all of this
09:30 - stuff and for most people it's probably
09:32 - going to be less expensive than that I
09:34 - have multiple corporations and when you
09:36 - kind of combine all of them together
09:37 - again yeah it's around fifteen hundred
09:38 - two thousand bucks for the year end
09:40 - statements okay next taxes now of course
09:44 - you need to pay taxes now a lot of times
09:47 - you don't know exactly how much you're
09:49 - going to owe in taxes and you need to
09:51 - pay it before you're going to be filing
09:53 - your year-end statements at least that's
09:55 - what happens for me in Canada so what I
09:57 - typically have to do is come up with
09:58 - some kind of estimate for what my
10:00 - taxable liability is going to be and I
10:02 - need to pay a little bit higher than
10:04 - that estimate before the taxes are due I
10:07 - think that's sometime in April uh here
10:09 - in Canada because my corporate year end
10:11 - is December 31st now again this is going
10:14 - to depend on your country but you need
10:15 - to pay your taxes so whenever you're
10:16 - running a corporation make sure you know
10:19 - what the corporate tax rate is and this
10:20 - is the rate that's going to be charged
10:22 - on your profits so if you have 100K
10:24 - profit at the end of the year and your
10:25 - corporate tax rate depending on the
10:27 - state or Province you live in is say 22
10:29 - percent you want to be keeping at least
10:31 - twenty two thousand dollars in the bank
10:32 - in cash ready to pay your taxes for me I
10:36 - keep probably six figures in the bank
10:38 - just to make sure I always have enough
10:39 - for taxes at any point in time and I
10:41 - typically pre repay my taxes a few
10:43 - months in advance to make sure I don't
10:45 - forget so general idea here is make sure
10:47 - you save for taxes and pay your taxes
10:49 - ask your accountant you probably have to
10:51 - come up with some kind of trial balance
10:52 - or some kind of uh kind of estimate for
10:54 - how much the taxes are going to be and
10:56 - again typically you pay that before you
10:58 - actually file your year end okay now
11:01 - once you file your year-end any amount
11:02 - you've paid over in taxes you will then
11:05 - be owed by the government typically you
11:07 - will just apply that to your balance the
11:09 - next year or you can actually take a
11:11 - refund check from the government
11:12 - depending on your situation if you've
11:14 - underpaid then obviously you need to pay
11:16 - up the balance and then what's going to
11:18 - happen is the government will put you on
11:20 - a schedule on when you owe taxes the
11:22 - next year so if you had a substantial
11:24 - amount of income or you owed a
11:25 - substantial amount in taxes typically
11:27 - they're going to get you to remit taxes
11:29 - based on your last year income either
11:31 - monthly or quarterly so for me this year
11:34 - for example I now need to submit my
11:36 - taxes quarterly and that's going to be
11:38 - one-fourth of the amount that I owed the
11:40 - previous year and then at the end of the
11:42 - year I will need to pay more probably if
11:44 - I had more income than I did in the last
11:46 - year again ask your accountant ask your
11:48 - lawyer they'll tell you what you owe but
11:50 - just remember taxes keep money in the
11:52 - bank make sure you have taxes and make
11:54 - sure you pay them on time all right so
11:56 - next we have HST or GST sales tax
11:59 - whatever you want to refer to it as now
12:01 - I don't know exactly how this works in
12:02 - the US but in Canada the way this works
12:04 - is that if you make more than thirty
12:06 - thousand dollars per year in a
12:08 - self-employment way then you need to
12:10 - charge HST on every single um product
12:13 - and service that you sell now here in my
12:16 - Province it is 15 I know that's
12:18 - ridiculous in some states I think it's
12:20 - what like two percent they might not
12:21 - even have have a sales tax anyways it's
12:24 - absurd but let's say I have 100 service
12:26 - that I'm selling to someone I actually
12:27 - have to charge them a hundred and
12:29 - fifteen dollars I need to mark that that
12:31 - 15 was for HST and then I need to remit
12:34 - that HST to the Canadian government now
12:37 - the only benefit here is that when you
12:39 - do this remains you also get to claim
12:41 - any HST that you have paid and you get
12:44 - that refunded so let's say I go and buy
12:46 - something for 200 bucks I pay 30 in HST
12:49 - now what I get to do at the end of the
12:51 - year is I get to say hey I paid 30 in
12:53 - HST give me my HST back and the
12:55 - government will send it back to me
12:57 - usually what happens is you're just
12:58 - going to subtract how much you owe them
13:00 - versus how much they owe you and then
13:02 - you're gonna pay them the difference or
13:03 - they're going to refund you the
13:04 - difference depending on what the amount
13:06 - is that's how it works in Canada I don't
13:09 - know how it works in the United States
13:10 - but I'm sure there's some kind of sales
13:12 - tax that you need to be charging if you
13:14 - live in a sales tax state and you need
13:16 - to make sure that you're doing that
13:17 - because if you don't do that you still
13:19 - owe the sales tax so let's say that I
13:22 - charge someone 100 when I should charge
13:23 - them 115 I owe 15 to the Canadian
13:27 - government because I didn't charge them
13:28 - HST when I was supposed to so that's out
13:30 - of my pocket it's not out of their
13:31 - pocket and that just means I'm losing
13:33 - money at the end of the year so any HST
13:35 - that you owe the government is not your
13:37 - money it's the government's money and
13:39 - again you may have to remit this
13:40 - quarterly you may have to remit this
13:42 - yearly depends on what the amount was
13:44 - the previous year and what schedule the
13:46 - government has you on
13:48 - [Music]
13:52 - all right so now we're going to move to
13:54 - probably the most important section in
13:55 - this video which is related to accessing
13:58 - corporate funds personal
14:00 - now the first thing I want to say here
14:01 - is that it is very very important that
14:04 - you understand what you're doing when
14:06 - you give yourself money from your
14:08 - corporation there is a variety of
14:10 - different ways to do this which is what
14:11 - I'm going to talk about here but it's
14:12 - very easy to accidentally commit fraud
14:15 - especially tax fraud if you don't
14:17 - understand what you're doing when you
14:18 - take money from your corporation and you
14:21 - use it personally the first thing you
14:23 - need to understand here this core
14:24 - concept is that the money in your
14:25 - corporation is different than your money
14:28 - personally what you can go and do in
14:30 - terms of buying a car or buying a house
14:32 - or spending daily expenses is much
14:34 - different than the corporation's funds
14:36 - okay so just because you made a hundred
14:38 - grand a year Corporation doesn't mean
14:40 - you can go and spend a hundred thousand
14:41 - dollars personally very very importantly
14:43 - understands it's also very important
14:45 - that you have a separate accounts right
14:47 - you have a separate corporate bank
14:49 - account you have a separate uh
14:50 - individual bank account you have
14:52 - separate credit cards for your
14:53 - corporation and for yourself personally
14:54 - even if you have say a personal credit
14:57 - card that you use in your corporation
14:58 - that's fine but you should have have
15:00 - that card only be used for corporate
15:02 - expenses so you're separating everything
15:04 - out and you're not accidentally
15:05 - committing fraud with the personal card
15:08 - that's used for your corporate account
15:10 - all right keep that in mind consult your
15:12 - accountants consult your lawyers make
15:14 - sure you know what you're doing here so
15:16 - now that we've talked about that and you
15:17 - understand that you need to keep these
15:18 - things separate we have to understand
15:20 - how you get money out of your
15:22 - corporation so first of all what money
15:24 - does your corporation have well you have
15:26 - all of the revenues that you generated
15:28 - you're gonna have cash which is
15:29 - typically going to be different than the
15:30 - revenues because you have expenses as
15:32 - well and your profit at the end of the
15:34 - year in the corporation is your Revenue
15:36 - minus your expenses okay that's the
15:38 - basic idea behind it now with those
15:41 - profits in your corporation that is the
15:43 - money that remains in your corporation
15:45 - unless you decide to take it out via
15:47 - dividends or maybe you reinvest it or
15:50 - whatever you put it somewhere but the
15:51 - idea is whatever you have in terms of
15:53 - profits is the after expense amount in
15:56 - your corporation that you then get
15:57 - charged corporate taxes on now now what
16:01 - do we do in terms of getting yourself
16:02 - money personal so again many different
16:05 - ways to do this the first and most
16:06 - popular way to take money out of your
16:08 - corporation is to pay yourself a salary
16:10 - now this is just like any other salary
16:12 - you would get from any kind of job okay
16:14 - you would issue in Canada it's called a
16:16 - T4 I'm not sure what it's called in the
16:18 - US but what happens is your corporation
16:20 - pays you say a hundred grand a year you
16:23 - then pay the personal income tax rate on
16:25 - a hundred thousand dollars and that a
16:27 - hundred thousand dollars is an expense
16:28 - to the corporation the corporation
16:31 - remits the taxes that you owe to the
16:33 - government on your behalf and it pays
16:35 - its half of the payroll taxes you pay
16:38 - your half of the payroll taxes and again
16:40 - all of this gets recorded and then your
16:41 - corporation issues you with T4 again
16:44 - that's what's called in Canada that you
16:45 - submit to the government at the end of
16:47 - the year to declare how much money you
16:49 - made personally from the corporation
16:51 - this money is your salary and your after
16:54 - tax amount that you take home you can
16:56 - spend on whatever you want you can go
16:58 - and be an idiot with it you can go buy a
16:59 - house you can do anything you want with
17:01 - that salary money okay step one now the
17:04 - thing with the salary is that you pay
17:07 - personal tax on this salary now again
17:10 - that's an expense to the corporation but
17:12 - typically your personal tax rate is
17:14 - going to be significantly higher than
17:15 - the tax rate in your corporation so it's
17:18 - not always the most beneficial to take
17:19 - money out of the corporation as a salary
17:22 - because this is the most expensive way
17:24 - to take the money you're paying personal
17:26 - tax rate on that sell okay that's step
17:30 - one most common most people are going to
17:31 - have some kind of salary and then in
17:34 - addition use these other ways that I'm
17:36 - going to talk about
17:37 - that's step one most basic now maybe not
17:39 - step two but method two is to use
17:42 - dividends now dividends is cash that's
17:45 - left in your company after you've paid
17:47 - your corporate taxes that you can then
17:49 - issue to shareholders now Dividends are
17:52 - taxed at a different rate than personal
17:54 - income is and this again is money that
17:57 - is left in your company and a dividend
17:59 - is not an expense to the company so if I
18:01 - dividend 50k or 100K out of my company
18:03 - that's not an expense to the business
18:05 - because this is money that I've already
18:07 - paid tax on that now I'm giving out to
18:10 - shareholders now there's a few rules
18:11 - here when it comes to issuing dividends
18:13 - so please uh you know consult your
18:15 - lawyer or your accountant or whatever is
18:17 - advising you on how to do this but this
18:19 - dividend is just essentially cash that
18:21 - you can give yourself personally now you
18:23 - get taxed on this personally the tax
18:25 - rate is much lower because you've
18:26 - already paid taxes on it in the
18:28 - corporation and now you're paying taxes
18:31 - on it again personally now in Canada we
18:33 - have an integrated tax system which
18:35 - essentially means it doesn't matter how
18:37 - you got money personally you're gonna
18:39 - end up paying essentially the exact same
18:41 - rate that you would have paid if you
18:43 - were to pay yourself personally okay now
18:45 - that might confuse some of you I'll dive
18:47 - into that more later but the idea is you
18:49 - have your salary and you have your
18:51 - dividends understand the core difference
18:52 - between them all right so we've talked
18:54 - about salary and dividends now we need
18:56 - to talk about loans now I don't hear
18:59 - many people talk about this but a very
19:01 - convenient way to take money out of your
19:02 - corporation is to take a loan now as the
19:05 - Director of your corporation you have
19:07 - the ability to issue yourself alone
19:09 - personally so I can say you know Tech
19:12 - within which is my Corporation is
19:14 - issuing Timor Sega which is me a ten
19:16 - thousand dollar loan now there's all
19:18 - kinds of rules on these loans first of
19:20 - all I don't have any interest on a loan
19:22 - I can do a zero interest loan however
19:24 - I'm only allowed to carry a loan on the
19:26 - books of my company to a director or
19:29 - shareholder of the company for two years
19:31 - now this is pretty obvious if you didn't
19:32 - have this then you could just infinitely
19:34 - loan money and then personally I can
19:36 - never pay that money back and of course
19:38 - I would just be fraud right so that's
19:39 - why they have this rule you can only
19:41 - carry the loan for two years now with
19:43 - this though that allows me to reduce the
19:45 - amount of tax I would have to pay to
19:47 - access large sums of money so for
19:50 - example recently I bought a house when I
19:51 - bought this house I needed a fair amount
19:53 - of money for a down payment I think I
19:55 - need an extra 15 grand so rather than me
19:57 - bonusing myself 30 grand which is how
20:00 - much I would have the bonus to have
20:01 - fifteen thousand dollars after tax
20:03 - because I live in Canada and the tax
20:04 - rate is absolutely insane then what I
20:07 - would do instead or what I did instead
20:08 - is I loaned myself fifteen thousand
20:10 - dollars now when I loan myself fifteen
20:12 - thousand dollars what this allows me to
20:14 - do is access the 15K immediately and
20:16 - then pay it back to the the company over
20:18 - two years now since it's two years this
20:21 - means I now have two years where I can
20:23 - keep my personal income relatively low
20:25 - and slowly pay back the loan at say a
20:28 - thousand dollars a month 750 a month
20:31 - whatever the amount actually may be now
20:33 - what I can also do is I can write off my
20:36 - loan amount that I owe the company with
20:38 - how much the company owes me so in a lot
20:41 - of situations like now I have an office
20:43 - right this office is at my house my
20:45 - Corporation pays me rent every single
20:47 - month to have the office in this house
20:49 - it pays part of the electricity bill
20:51 - because of all the computers and lights
20:52 - and all this stuff going on here it pays
20:54 - part of my gas for any travel expenses
20:57 - Etc so at the end of each year my
20:59 - Corporation ends up owing me a few
21:00 - thousand dollars so now I offset the
21:03 - loan amount so say I owe the Corp ten
21:04 - Grand then if the Corp owes me Seven
21:06 - Grand now I only owe the corporation
21:08 - three thousand dollars then if I need to
21:10 - clear the loan balance I can dividend
21:12 - myself the amount and clear the loan or
21:15 - I can just wait till the next year and
21:16 - pay it off slow so hopefully this is
21:19 - making a little bit of sense but the
21:20 - basic idea is that when you need a large
21:22 - sum of money what you can do is loan
21:24 - yourself it rather than paying it
21:25 - yourself as a bonus or as a part of your
21:27 - salary and then that way you can reduce
21:29 - the amount of tax you pay immediately
21:31 - and just pay back the loan over time now
21:34 - you may still be short on how much you
21:35 - have to pay back if that's the case then
21:37 - you issue a dividend at the end of the
21:39 - year to clear the loan balance and then
21:41 - you do have to pay tax on whatever that
21:42 - dividend amount was alright so I think
21:44 - that's pretty much it for accessing
21:45 - corporate funds personally again the
21:47 - summary is you have a salary you have
21:49 - dividends and you have loans and those
21:51 - are really the three ways you access
21:53 - your corporate funds in a personal
21:54 - manner the whole idea here is to use
21:56 - these in a combination strategically
21:58 - such that you reduce the amount of tax
22:00 - you have to pay on money you pay
22:02 - yourself in the form of a salary or even
22:04 - as dividends because that is the most
22:06 - amount of tax you ever have to pay when
22:08 - you get salaried income so this is
22:11 - especially important when your income
22:12 - starts getting quite large what you want
22:14 - to do is reduce the amount that you're
22:16 - paying yourself personally only to
22:18 - reduce the amount of personal tax you
22:19 - want to keep some of that money in your
22:21 - corporation invest in your corporation
22:23 - rather than investing personally and use
22:25 - a strategy I'm about to talk to you
22:26 - about called dripping out
22:30 - [Music]
22:33 - all right so now we're going to move on
22:34 - to deferring taxes and controlling
22:37 - income now this is the main benefit of
22:39 - holding a corporation especially if you
22:40 - own it just as an individual now most of
22:43 - us understand at this point when you get
22:45 - paid a salary you pay the highest amount
22:47 - of tax you pay on essentially any kind
22:49 - of income your active income which is
22:51 - your salary income is taxed the highest
22:54 - in Canada if you make 250 000 or more a
22:57 - year you are taxed at 53 and a half
22:59 - percent on every single dollar Above
23:02 - 250. So if I were to pay myself 500
23:04 - effectively I would be left with about
23:06 - 250 000 that's about what the math works
23:10 - out too it might be slightly more than
23:11 - that about 265 regardless think about
23:14 - that you make half a million dollars a
23:16 - year but you only keep 260 or 265 or 270
23:20 - even if it's 300 still that's a
23:22 - ridiculous amount of tax to be paying to
23:24 - the government so with a corporation the
23:26 - benefit here is that you can control
23:28 - this if you make a million dollars a
23:30 - year in your corporation you don't have
23:32 - to pay yourself a million dollars you
23:34 - can pay yourself a hundred grand 150
23:37 - Grand you can pay yourself the minimum
23:39 - you need to survive and then you
23:41 - essentially pay the least amount of
23:43 - taxes you possibly can to the Canadian
23:45 - government in a personal way now in the
23:48 - U.S exact same thing now I know taxes
23:50 - are lower in the US it depends on what
23:51 - state you live in there's all kinds of
23:53 - different strategies based on your loc
23:55 - and what you're doing there but the
23:57 - concept is the same you don't want to
23:59 - pay yourself an absurd amount of money
24:01 - out of the corporation because then you
24:03 - just get absolutely rinsed on taxes now
24:06 - the question comes okay that's great I
24:08 - understand that Tim but how do I get my
24:10 - money and use it from the corporation
24:12 - well this is where kind of the process
24:14 - of Dripping it out comes so for me I
24:17 - know that I'm not gonna spend half a
24:19 - million dollars a year I'm not going to
24:21 - spend a massive amount I don't want to
24:22 - go buy like crazy things that cost
24:24 - hundreds of thousands of dollars so
24:26 - rather than me taking this money now and
24:28 - giving it to myself personally and
24:30 - forfeiting 200 Grand and 250 Grand I'm
24:32 - going to defer my tax over a very long
24:35 - period of time and pay small amounts of
24:37 - tax every single year on the money that
24:40 - I pay myself now what this allows me to
24:42 - do is um a mass a large sum of money
24:46 - that's already been taxed at a corporate
24:48 - level in my Corporation I have way more
24:51 - money in my Corporation than I would if
24:53 - I were to pay it out personally so I can
24:55 - now invest this money in my Corporation
24:57 - and make outsized Returns on this larger
25:00 - sum of money than if I were to pay it to
25:03 - myself personally and simply invest it
25:05 - in my personal account so again what I'm
25:07 - doing is I'm saying I'm gonna pay myself
25:08 - the minimum I possibly can to survive
25:11 - what I need for groceries what I need
25:12 - for rent what I need for a vacation
25:14 - whatever money I want to spend that's
25:16 - what I pay myself personally I
25:17 - essentially spend all of it I save a
25:19 - little bit so I have a bit of a personal
25:21 - cushion but essentially I have unlimited
25:23 - access to funds from my company so why
25:26 - do I need to pay it to myself when I
25:28 - don't need the money I don't so instead
25:30 - I pay myself whatever ever I require I
25:33 - pay the taxes on that and then I keep
25:35 - the rest of my money sitting in my
25:37 - Corporation now yes it does get taxed in
25:39 - my Corporation but in Canada the
25:40 - corporate tax are in the province I live
25:42 - in is 11 so that means that I now keep
25:45 - hundreds of thousands of dollars more
25:47 - per year than if I were to dump it out
25:49 - and just pay it to myself personally I
25:51 - take all that money I invest it and now
25:53 - my money that's invested can make so
25:55 - much more money that later down the line
25:58 - I don't mind paying myself a little bit
25:59 - more and paying some more tax because
26:01 - all of this invested funds is generating
26:04 - essentially full-time salaries right
26:06 - massive amounts of income per year
26:08 - because I have a way larger amount than
26:10 - if I were to give it to myself
26:11 - personally so hopefully you guys are
26:13 - understanding the process here you want
26:14 - to amass the large amount of capital in
26:17 - a company where it's taxed at a very
26:19 - minimal amount for in the US I think
26:21 - it's like 22 25 right for me I have
26:23 - small business tax rate currently soon
26:25 - I'm going to be out of the small
26:26 - business tax rate and having to pay more
26:28 - but for me it's only 11 so I take all
26:30 - this massive amount of money I keep it
26:32 - in my company I invested in the company
26:34 - and it grows grows grows grows grows and
26:36 - then I slowly drip my money out every
26:38 - single year and defer all of my taxes
26:40 - over a long period of time now once you
26:43 - get to the point where you have millions
26:44 - upon millions of dollars okay you can
26:46 - start taking out more and yeah you're
26:48 - gonna pay a high amount of tax but at
26:49 - that point your Investments have grown
26:51 - so massively because of the strategy you
26:53 - used earlier now you don't mind paying
26:55 - the extra amount of tax whereas again if
26:57 - I were to pay the tax earlier that
26:59 - reduces the amount that I can invest and
27:01 - reduces the amount I can make on my
27:02 - investments and can compound over time
27:05 - hopefully that makes sense but that's
27:07 - the strategy here that's what you want
27:09 - to consider and that's how you need to
27:10 - kind of think about this whole strategy
27:12 - using the corporation
27:15 - [Music]
27:18 - all right so now we move on to talking
27:20 - about some details related to investing
27:22 - in a company or a corporation first of
27:25 - all you can obviously do this any
27:27 - massive company you know has Investments
27:29 - or has holding companies that hold
27:30 - Investments for them okay so you can
27:32 - invest in a company most very wealthy
27:34 - people you know have a lot of their
27:36 - Assets in different corporations
27:39 - um for this this purpose right for
27:40 - investing now one thing you want to know
27:43 - about investing in a company is you have
27:44 - a realized gain versus an unrealized
27:46 - game now this applies personally as well
27:47 - but the idea is your realized gain is a
27:51 - gain that you have made by selling the
27:53 - investment an unrealized gain is a game
27:56 - that you've made but you've not yet sold
27:57 - you haven't essentially locked that game
27:59 - in so very simple example I invest fifty
28:01 - dollars it goes to a hundred dollars I
28:03 - don't sell the investment I have an
28:05 - unrealized gain of fifty dollars okay
28:07 - realized example I have 50 bucks becomes
28:10 - 100 I sell it I have a realized gain of
28:13 - fifty dollars my investment went up by
28:15 - 50 bucks now this gain gets taxed you
28:19 - only get taxed on the gain when it is
28:22 - realized now this is another way to
28:23 - defer taxes you never realize again or
28:26 - you take a very long time or you realize
28:27 - it over time right anyways I realized my
28:30 - gain of fifty dollars as soon as this
28:32 - become realized now I pay capital gains
28:34 - tax now capital gains tax is 50 of the
28:37 - capital gain is taxed at whatever the
28:40 - capital gains tax rate
28:41 - I know this seems a little bit confusing
28:43 - but if I had made 50 bucks right that's
28:46 - my realized gain only half of that so 25
28:48 - is taxed and that's taxed at a different
28:50 - rate depending on a lot of other factors
28:53 - State Province Etc right so in my case
28:55 - it's taxed at about 50 and that means
28:58 - that effectively I get taxed 25 on the
29:01 - total gain so if I made 50 bucks I get
29:04 - taxed 25 I pay 12.50 in capital gains
29:07 - tax there you go okay that's how capital
29:10 - gains tax works now next thing you need
29:13 - to understand is that once you have all
29:15 - this money right and it's invested you
29:17 - won't start thinking about reducing your
29:19 - liability so the issue happens or the
29:22 - issue occurs when you start obtaining a
29:24 - lot of Investments or a lot of cash
29:26 - within an operational company so for
29:29 - example I have Tech with to make I do
29:30 - sponsorships I have all kinds of clients
29:32 - I you know sell courses and there is
29:34 - some inherent liability in what I'm
29:36 - doing it's possible I could get sued for
29:39 - something now if I were to be investing
29:41 - all of my assets in my main operational
29:43 - company and I got sued those assets are
29:46 - up for grabs so what you need to start
29:48 - considering once you get larger sums of
29:50 - money is how do I protect these assets
29:53 - from the liability of my Corporation now
29:56 - you're reducing liability at a corporate
29:58 - level not at a personal level so we've
30:00 - already reduced the personal liability
30:02 - by separating our operations into a
30:05 - company now we need to separate our
30:06 - assets into a holding company to reduce
30:09 - liability from the operations of the
30:11 - main company okay so hopefully this is
30:14 - making a bit of sense so what you want
30:15 - to do is you want to set up now a
30:17 - separate corporate entity and there's
30:19 - all kinds of complex structures to do
30:20 - this I'm not going to walk you through
30:21 - the exact process but you need to set up
30:23 - a separate company with legal advice
30:25 - that will allow you to transfer assets
30:28 - from your main corporation into this
30:30 - company now typically what ends up
30:32 - happening is your holding company is
30:34 - going to own the operational company or
30:37 - it's going to be the beneficiary of
30:38 - something like a trust and the trust is
30:40 - going to own the operational company now
30:42 - this allows you to essentially take the
30:44 - profits from your operational company
30:46 - and transfer them to the holding company
30:49 - where then in the holding company they
30:51 - get invested now in this holding company
30:53 - you have zero operations the whole
30:55 - purpose of the holding company is to
30:57 - hold the assets of one or potentially
30:59 - multiple operational companies so now
31:01 - you invest in the holding company and
31:04 - you reduce that liability so now if your
31:06 - operational company gets sued they can
31:08 - only come after the assets of the
31:09 - operational company owns not the a
31:12 - holding company because the holding
31:13 - company is on top owning the operational
31:15 - company now it's very important that
31:17 - when you do this you don't taint the way
31:20 - that assets are transferred if you
31:22 - transfer Assets in a non kind of legal
31:25 - way or in a certain way you can
31:27 - essentially taint the relationship
31:28 - between your operational company and
31:31 - your holding company and you can open up
31:33 - liability in your holding company so
31:35 - again this is something you need to talk
31:37 - to a lawyer about I'm not quite
31:38 - qualified to get into that much detail
31:39 - but just understand that the way you
31:42 - transfer is important and you need to
31:43 - discuss this with professionals that
31:46 - have set up these structures before all
31:48 - right
31:49 - so with that said that's pretty much
31:50 - gonna wrap up this video there was quite
31:52 - a bit of stuff here I apologize it was
31:54 - kind of all over the place but I really
31:56 - just wanted to sit down and kind of just
31:57 - rant you guys about all this business
31:59 - knowledge because I feel like I've
32:00 - obtained quite a bit I've learned so
32:02 - much over the past few years and this is
32:04 - stuff that took me a really long time to
32:06 - learn was really expensive and that I
32:08 - think should be free and that all of you
32:09 - should know and understand if I had been
32:11 - taught this when I was 17 18 I can only
32:13 - imagine where I would be right now and I
32:15 - hope that this opened up your kind of
32:17 - Horizons and perspective on what's
32:19 - possible with corporate structures and
32:21 - why you should consider getting into
32:22 - them as your income grows full
32:24 - disclosure here I make hundreds of
32:26 - thousands of dollars per year this is
32:28 - not something that makes sense to do
32:29 - unless you make a lot of money if you
32:32 - don't make a lot of money you're gonna
