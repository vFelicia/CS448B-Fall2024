00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back so in
00:02 - this video
00:03 - i'm going to share with you the fastest
00:04 - and most effective way to learn a new
00:06 - programming language
00:07 - now the reason i'm making this video is
00:09 - because so often people jump into these
00:11 - huge courses online right
00:13 - maybe they're buying some course maybe
00:15 - they're looking at you know like a 10
00:16 - hour long youtube video
00:18 - maybe they're going and reading all the
00:19 - documentation or buying textbooks
00:21 - just to learn a new programming language
00:23 - now i'm here to tell you that is
00:25 - completely unnecessary and although
00:27 - there is some value in doing that and of
00:28 - course you're going to learn more than
00:30 - maybe from spending an hour trying to
00:31 - practice the programming language
00:33 - if you're just looking to get up and
00:34 - running as fast as possible you want to
00:36 - understand the main concepts and kind of
00:38 - learn as you go then following the
00:40 - technique that i'm going to share with
00:41 - you in this video is a much better use
00:43 - of your time and is definitely going to
00:45 - lead to you having a better
00:46 - understanding of the language that
00:47 - you're using
00:48 - so with that being said let's go ahead
00:50 - and get started and i'll talk to you
00:51 - about the fastest
00:52 - and most effective way to learn a new
00:54 - programming life now as we all know
00:56 - being a developer involves constantly
00:58 - learning and developing new skills
01:00 - personally though this is one of my
01:01 - favorite parts of this field because
01:03 - learning something new is always
01:04 - energizing
01:05 - and it leads to personal growth now the
01:07 - sponsor of this video which is x team
01:09 - takes this learning and growing very
01:11 - seriously and is committed to helping
01:13 - its employees do so
01:15 - x team is an 100 remote company that
01:17 - supplies brands and businesses

02:03 - today by hitting the link in the
02:06 - description
02:08 - [Music]
02:14 - so i'm about to share with you some
02:15 - concrete steps and kind of a procedure
02:17 - or process
02:18 - that you can follow to learn a new
02:19 - programming language quickly
02:21 - now the goal of this process or
02:23 - procedure is going to be to make this as
02:25 - time efficient as possible
02:26 - and to focus on your understanding and
02:28 - not your memorization of specific
02:31 - concepts or syntax
02:32 - so that leads me right into the first
02:34 - point the first thing that i always do
02:36 - whenever i'm learning a new programming
02:37 - language
02:38 - and this may seem strange but what i do
02:39 - is learn about why this programming
02:42 - language is unique
02:43 - or different from ones that i already
02:45 - know now of course this means you
02:47 - already have to know a programming
02:48 - language you can still apply the formula
02:50 - that i'm about to tell you if you don't
02:51 - but of course this video really is
02:53 - geared towards people that already have
02:54 - you know programming fundamentals and
02:56 - know
02:56 - at least one programming language but
02:59 - the reason i do this is because i want
03:00 - to
03:01 - very clearly at the beginning of this
03:03 - kind of learning process
03:04 - understand what i actually need to learn
03:07 - i want to know what the core differences
03:09 - are
03:09 - i want to understand why i would use
03:11 - javascript and not python
03:13 - i want to understand why this language
03:15 - is maybe superior in some ways is not
03:17 - superior
03:18 - and of course i want to know some basic
03:20 - features of it like is this a typed
03:21 - language is it dynamic
03:23 - do i have to compile this is it an
03:25 - interpreter all of these basic things
03:27 - are what i want to start off with
03:29 - so i have an idea of what i'm getting
03:30 - myself into and what i'm about to have
03:32 - to learn
03:33 - the next thing i do after i kind of get
03:35 - a general sense of what this language is
03:38 - i understand the uses and the main
03:39 - differences between the one that i know
03:41 - is i go to some official documentation
03:43 - or i go to some
03:44 - really extensive tutorial or guide
03:47 - something that has a table of contents
03:49 - for this language
03:50 - i look for something that's like as big
03:51 - as i can find and then i quickly
03:53 - skim through the table of contents the
03:55 - reason i do this is because i want to
03:57 - see immediately
03:58 - if there's anything in this language any
04:00 - keywords any features maybe something
04:02 - that i haven't seen
04:04 - in a programming language i already know
04:06 - that's the first thing that i do for
04:08 - example if i'm learning python and i
04:10 - come from a different programming
04:11 - language
04:12 - well something that might stand out to
04:13 - me is say like list comprehensions
04:16 - or the fact that i can like define a
04:17 - function inside of another function
04:19 - just a bunch of things that say you
04:21 - can't do in another programming language
04:23 - but that you can do in this one
04:24 - so i'll go through the table of contents
04:26 - i'll figure out all this stuff that i
04:28 - don't yet know or that i've never seen
04:30 - before
04:30 - and i'll write it down and that is not
04:32 - going to be where i start but those are
04:34 - going to be the things that i need to
04:35 - focus on and then i'm going to spend
04:36 - more time
04:37 - learning because i don't already know
04:39 - them from the previous language
04:41 - the next thing that i'll do so we're
04:42 - moving on to step three here we had step
04:44 - one and step two already
04:45 - is i will go and i will find some course
04:48 - some tutorial
04:49 - something that can give me a general
04:51 - overview something that's fast say like
04:53 - under an
04:53 - hour of the programming language now i
04:56 - might watch a youtube video i might go
04:57 - find like a nice article or maybe a
04:59 - tutor like interactive tutorial or
05:01 - something
05:01 - and i'll spend about an hour usually not
05:04 - more than that
05:04 - just going through following along and
05:06 - trying to get a sense of what this
05:08 - language is like
05:09 - and just kind of a general introduction
05:11 - so that is my step three
05:13 - is go find some resource that's about an
05:15 - hour long maybe an hour and a half and
05:16 - just kind of follow along with it
05:18 - and just get a sense of what this
05:20 - language is now as soon as i've done
05:22 - that so i figured out the main
05:23 - differences
05:24 - i know kind of the main uses of this
05:25 - language and then i have a general sense
05:27 - of it from some tutorial or video
05:29 - i'll immediately open up a website say
05:31 - like leak code or algo
05:32 - expert or some place that i can practice
05:34 - really easy programming problems
05:37 - the reason for this is i want to
05:38 - immediately take anything i know about
05:40 - this language
05:41 - and just start trying it just start
05:43 - practicing and just start seeing
05:45 - you know how i can actually use these
05:46 - language features
05:48 - and usually what that does is it
05:50 - immediately points out to me what i
05:52 - don't yet understand about this language
05:54 - and what makes a lot of sense
05:55 - maybe i have my programming fundamentals
05:57 - down so i know how to do the for loops
05:59 - and i'll do the if statements
06:00 - i have to cross check with some syntax
06:02 - on a website or with a quick google
06:04 - search
06:04 - but this is going to expose to me
06:06 - immediately the stuff that i need to
06:08 - focus on and what i should learn next
06:10 - so i'll spend maybe about an hour doing
06:11 - that or however long i feel is
06:13 - reasonable and i've got some good
06:15 - practice in
06:15 - and then i'll say okay so when i was
06:17 - doing this i noticed that i really
06:18 - didn't understand this concept
06:20 - this one was a bit confusing i had a lot
06:22 - of trouble with this syntax
06:24 - let me go look that up now and figure
06:26 - out what those things are so now i'll
06:28 - have a list you know maybe of like 10
06:29 - things
06:30 - that i don't really understand and that
06:31 - i want to look up so i'll look up those
06:33 - specific
06:34 - things figure them out and then again go
06:36 - back to the programming problems and
06:38 - practice them
06:39 - and this is the loop that i will
06:40 - continue to do until i get somewhat
06:42 - comfortable with the language
06:45 - once i'm comfortable with this language
06:46 - and i'm like okay i have a grasp of it
06:48 - i understand the basic syntax i feel
06:50 - like i could write a program in this
06:52 - maybe i need a bit of help but generally
06:54 - it makes sense immediately i pick
06:56 - some kind of project something small
06:58 - maybe like an hour and a half
06:59 - two hours and just dive in and i just
07:01 - try to make that project
07:03 - now i know this seems overwhelming and
07:05 - people are going to be like oh i don't
07:06 - have a project idea
07:07 - you can make whatever excuse you want
07:09 - but just go look up some template
07:10 - project
07:11 - project ideas whatever you want and just
07:13 - start trying to make something
07:15 - this is great because you're going to
07:16 - learn an enormous amount when you're in
07:19 - this project
07:20 - and if you already have a basic
07:21 - understanding you should be able to get
07:23 - enough done if you pick a simple enough
07:25 - project
07:25 - that you can just kind of look things up
07:27 - on the side and just find the
07:28 - information that you need
07:30 - and honestly you can do all of this in
07:32 - one day
07:33 - i know that sounds like a lot but let's
07:35 - say you said today you know i'm learning
07:36 - python or i'm learning go i'm learning
07:38 - javascript
07:39 - all the stuff that i just said
07:40 - realistically you should be able to do
07:42 - in a day's work so say eight hours and
07:44 - then you can come back tomorrow
07:46 - after a good night's sleep you know
07:48 - continue to work on the project and look
07:49 - things up and that should give you a
07:51 - really good fundamental understanding of
07:53 - the language and you should be ready to
07:55 - pick up some
07:55 - more more advanced concepts you should
07:57 - have a decent understanding
07:58 - and you will have actually practiced a
08:00 - lot of this stuff and not just heard
08:02 - about it from someone else
08:04 - so really that is the procedure i'm
08:06 - gonna summarize it here
08:07 - one more time so the first step is to
08:09 - understand the fundamental differences
08:11 - between
08:12 - this language that you're learning and
08:13 - some language that you already know
08:15 - figure out the basic features of this
08:17 - language is it typed is it dynamic do i
08:20 - need to
08:20 - compile this what does my dev
08:22 - environment need to look like what is
08:24 - this used for what is this not used for
08:26 - understand all of those things and then
08:28 - you move on to step two
08:29 - which is finding some resource some
08:31 - official documentation or some large
08:33 - guide
08:34 - that can give you a kind of summary or
08:36 - table of contents
08:37 - of all of the different main language
08:40 - features
08:41 - again the point of this is to go through
08:42 - that table of contents
08:44 - and find all of the things that you've
08:46 - never seen before or that don't make any
08:47 - sense and that you're definitely going
08:49 - to need to learn
08:50 - and kind of keep track of those make a
08:51 - list and have them ready so that when
08:53 - you move further in the language you
08:54 - know that that's what i need to move on
08:56 - to next
08:56 - and that's what i should learn next
08:59 - after you've done that you have an idea
09:00 - of all of the main things that you kind
09:02 - of don't already know or that you think
09:03 - are going to be challenging
09:05 - find some resource that can give you a
09:06 - really quick and good overview of the
09:09 - language
09:09 - so go on youtube find some hour long
09:12 - course find a crash course a speed
09:14 - course
09:14 - go find some you know article or
09:16 - something quick on the internet that you
09:18 - can read through in about an
09:19 - hour and just get a good understanding
09:21 - and kind of grasp
09:22 - of what this language looks like some of
09:24 - you know the styles of writing it
09:26 - and all of those different things after
09:28 - you do that
09:29 - immediately hop on to lead code hop onto
09:32 - algo
09:32 - expert some website that you can
09:34 - practice programming problems on
09:36 - and just start doing easy or medium
09:38 - programming problems whatever your
09:39 - current like skill level is on those
09:41 - websites or whatever you think you can
09:43 - do
09:43 - just go ahead and start practicing those
09:45 - and this will immediately expose to you
09:47 - the gaps in your knowledge
09:49 - and the things that you really
09:50 - understand and that you really don't
09:52 - understand
09:52 - you can keep track of these things but
09:54 - you'll probably just remember them
09:55 - anyways
09:56 - and then after you've done a good amount
09:57 - of practice go through your list of
10:00 - things you don't know yet and just start
10:01 - learning those specific things this
10:03 - should be easy because these should be
10:05 - small
10:05 - different things right and they should
10:07 - just take you a few minutes a quick
10:08 - google search maybe you know a 10 15
10:10 - minute video
10:11 - and you can kind of go through these
10:12 - things and after you learn one you can
10:14 - go back to that cycle
10:15 - where you practice it and then you
10:16 - figure out okay did i get that or not
10:18 - learn it again and back and back and
10:20 - forth so you're cycling through
10:21 - practicing
10:22 - learning a concept practicing learning a
10:24 - concept so on and so forth
10:26 - finally once you feel somewhat
10:28 - comfortable with the language you've got
10:29 - some practice in and you feel like you
10:30 - could maybe write a
10:32 - program then you go ahead and you
10:34 - actually jump into making your first
10:36 - programming project in this language now
10:38 - hopefully you've learned enough at this
10:40 - point where you can just pick something
10:41 - simple and you can kind of have
10:43 - a high degree of confidence you'll at
10:44 - least be able to finish it right
10:46 - and of course when you're going through
10:47 - you're probably going to forget a lot of
10:48 - stuff there's going to be stuff you need
10:50 - to look up and things you don't need to
10:51 - do
10:52 - but this will be great because you're
10:53 - actually going to be applying everything
10:55 - you've learned into a project
10:56 - and you're going to be learning stuff as
10:58 - you go and kind of cross cross
10:59 - referencing say some of the resources
11:01 - you looked at
11:01 - and the code that you're currently
11:03 - writing after that you should have a
11:05 - really good grasp of this language
11:07 - and now it's just time to learn about
11:09 - all those things that maybe you've never
11:10 - seen before
11:11 - are more complex and then after that you
11:13 - really should pretty much be done
11:16 - now of course this is the basics this is
11:18 - the fundamentals this get you up and
11:19 - running nice and quick
11:20 - this is not going to teach you every
11:22 - single advanced feature in the language
11:24 - but this is what i'll do especially if i
11:26 - want to learn a programming language
11:28 - fast and fairly effectively so that has
11:30 - been my guide and kind of my tips for
11:32 - picking up a programming language
11:34 - quickly and
11:34 - effectively i would love to hear what
11:36 - you guys think about this in the
11:37 - comments down below
11:39 - is there any tips that you agree with
11:40 - disagree with is there any advice you
11:42 - would give people please do let me know
11:44 - and with that being said if you enjoyed
11:45 - make sure you leave a like subscribe to
11:47 - the channel and of course i will see you
11:48 - again in another youtube video
11:58 - you
