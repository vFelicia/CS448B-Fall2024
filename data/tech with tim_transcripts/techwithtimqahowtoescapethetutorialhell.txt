00:00 - hello everybody and welcome to the first
00:02 - ever QA on this channel so you guys
00:04 - asked me so many different questions and
00:05 - I wanted to make sure I could answer as
00:07 - many as possible so what I actually did
00:09 - was filmed an hour-long podcast where I
00:11 - pretty much just answered questions the
00:13 - entire time so that's all my second
00:14 - YouTube channel called time' with tim
00:16 - that's where i'm posting weekly podcast
00:18 - episodes and some clips and fun stuff
00:20 - like that so definitely check that out
00:21 - but in here what I've done is compiled
00:23 - the most popular questions the ones that
00:25 - I thought I had the best answers to and
00:27 - put them in this shorter video that you
00:29 - guys can listen to here on my main
00:30 - channel tech with Tim now the other
00:32 - person you're gonna see in this video is
00:34 - my brother his name is Noah
00:35 - he's 17 I believe and he just asked me a
00:38 - bunch of questions from Twitter YouTube
00:40 - just so it was more of a conversational
00:42 - tone to the video not just me you know
00:44 - reading the question answering it I
00:45 - figured that would be better but anyways
00:46 - let me know what you guys think leave a
00:48 - comment down below and I hope you guys
00:50 - enjoyed this Q&A can you give us a list
00:52 - of coding projects to try during the
00:54 - quarantine okay so I'm not gonna give
00:55 - you list on this podcast because I
00:57 - literally have said coding projects so
00:59 - much like I get asked this is the most
01:00 - asked question by far on my youtube
01:02 - channel just anywhere like give me
01:04 - projects work and I need ideas I need
01:05 - inspiration I have like six or seven
01:07 - YouTube videos that are literally titled
01:09 - five beginner Python projects five
01:11 - intermediate Python projects five
01:13 - machine learning and AI projects five
01:15 - coding projects to work on during the
01:17 - quarantine like I have a video labeled
01:18 - that so uh you know you guys can go
01:20 - watch those and I guarantee you you will
01:22 - have some inspiration or some ideas for
01:24 - something to work on awesome alright the
01:26 - next question is actually one that I'm
01:27 - kind of curious about as well so the
01:30 - subscribers saying if you didn't take up
01:32 - coding if you didn't go into computer
01:33 - science what profession would you have
01:35 - pursued yeah so this is an interesting
01:37 - one I've thought about this before I
01:38 - would like to say something like
01:40 - aerospace engineering or something like
01:42 - that something to do with like rocket
01:44 - spaceships like you know studying like
01:46 - extraterrestrial life like getting you
01:49 - know like what you mom uh skis doing for
01:50 - example with SpaceX and all of that like
01:52 - that really interests me like I would
01:54 - love to work at that company or any you
01:56 - know elong company for that matter and
01:58 - I've just always been really interested
01:59 - in exploring the possibilities beyond
02:02 - like human life like I like talking
02:04 - about that stuff I like thinking about
02:06 - the idea of you know aliens and of
02:08 - making these mass engineering projects
02:10 - that can take us to other planets so I
02:12 - can say
02:13 - that when I was younger potentially
02:15 - doing something like that that's
02:17 - probably what I would do I don't know if
02:18 - I would necessarily be in school doing
02:20 - that I don't know if I'd be an aerospace
02:21 - engineer an aerospace engineering just
02:23 - means like designing rocket ships and
02:25 - stuff like that that's my basic
02:26 - understanding of it at least but it's
02:28 - something I definitely would you know
02:30 - want to pursue and that I do look into
02:31 - like I'll read physics documents one of
02:34 - my roommates is a physics major like we
02:36 - have conversations all the time because
02:37 - I'm just really interested in how things
02:39 - work why they work and exploring like
02:41 - space and what's not on earth and what's
02:43 - above us that we don't yet know about so
02:45 - yeah awesome all right next question
02:47 - comes from Miguel here it's kind of a
02:48 - long one how do you learn a new language
02:50 - or framework do you watch tutorials go
02:52 - through the documents or do you make a
02:54 - project and you google what you need
02:55 - like as you're going through and then
02:57 - he's also wondering if you're currently
02:59 - making any projects with all this free
03:00 - time that we have during the kovat
03:02 - situation yeah sure so um I get asked
03:05 - this a lot like how do I learn things
03:07 - cuz all clearly you know I have a domain
03:08 - knowledge of programming Python modules
03:10 - how do I actually get into them and
03:12 - start learning them for me uh I've kind
03:15 - of at the point where I'm pretty good at
03:17 - learning now this seems like a weird
03:18 - thing to say but the more you learn the
03:20 - more you go it on your own and teach
03:21 - yourself things the better you get at
03:23 - doing that right and you learn very
03:25 - quickly how do you learn and you
03:27 - understand the resources you should use
03:29 - to learn the fastest and most effective
03:31 - way for me what I do specifically and
03:34 - I'm not recommending this I'm just
03:36 - telling you what I do is really just
03:38 - skim through documentation and try
03:39 - things out I have somewhat of an ability
03:42 - maybe it's unique I don't know where I
03:44 - can just kind of look at things and
03:45 - almost immediately understand and be
03:47 - able to use them like I can read through
03:49 - the flask documentation and after
03:51 - reading through the flask documentation
03:52 - have a really good understanding of how
03:54 - flask works and be able to start
03:56 - explaining certain aspects of it so what
03:58 - I'll usually do because I like a 20
04:00 - minute video is it not something I'm
04:02 - usually gonna watch unless I'm
04:03 - struggling with a topic is go to like
04:06 - blog posts documentation finds things
04:08 - that are brief but that explained well
04:10 - and just read through them and then
04:12 - build kind of an understanding of the
04:13 - topic in my own head find areas that I
04:16 - don't quite understand and then
04:17 - reinforce those so let's say I'm
04:19 - learning you know the kitty module I'll
04:20 - go to the KB documentation I'll look at
04:22 - first of all the examples I have I'll
04:24 - seek it what examples have they done
04:26 - using Kibby that I think I could digest
04:28 - I'll skim through the code I'll read
04:29 - through it and try to have a general
04:31 - overview of what the language is from
04:33 - there I'll try to break down k it seems
04:35 - like there's these different things then
04:37 - I'll go to the documentation page and
04:38 - I'll start learning the things that I
04:40 - want to learn so I'll say okay I
04:41 - probably don't care about that I don't
04:42 - care about that this seems useful that
04:44 - seems useful let's learn not read
04:46 - through the documentation have a Python
04:47 - window open on the right hand side of my
04:49 - screen try some different things try
04:51 - some things that aren't in the
04:52 - documentation and then from there I kind
04:54 - of just understand it and I kind of just
04:56 - know what to do but that has come with
04:57 - me reading you know thousands of page of
05:00 - pages of documentation watching tons of
05:02 - videos like going through so many
05:04 - different things under stuck the point
05:05 - where I know what my brain needs to
05:08 - learn information and I just give it
05:10 - that and it's hard to tell you you know
05:12 - advice on how to learn a new modular
05:13 - topic for most people it's gonna be
05:15 - watching a video and hearing someone
05:17 - explain it but for someone like me who's
05:19 - done that so much it's just really easy
05:21 - to go to some kind of text-based
05:22 - document skim through it really quickly
05:24 - pick up the information I need and you
05:26 - don't conceptualize that and understand
05:28 - the topic alright so the next one coming
05:30 - from YouTube as well
05:31 - what will you suggest to the beginners
05:33 - who are stuck in the tutorial hell
05:35 - alright so tutorial how this is a common
05:37 - one I think this one was uploaded quite
05:39 - a bit and yeah so this is a tough one so
05:42 - a lot of people and I'm just gonna kind
05:44 - of summarize what I mean by tutorial
05:46 - Helen what I think this person is saying
05:47 - is when you you can program but you can
05:51 - only do so when you're following along
05:53 - with a guide or following along with the
05:55 - tutorial video and what happens is you
05:57 - know you've been learning programming
05:58 - for three months but your idea of
06:00 - learning programming is just watching a
06:02 - ton tutorials copying and pasting the
06:05 - code and not really retaining anything
06:07 - just like copying stuff down so how do
06:09 - you get out of that is what he's asking
06:10 - again that's tough the way that I
06:13 - recommend doing that is working on
06:15 - projects now a lot of people get upset
06:17 - at me when I say this circle I don't
06:18 - know what to work on I'm not good enough
06:19 - to work on projects and that's where I
06:21 - say why does it matter I'm like you need
06:23 - to make a full scale web app no do you
06:25 - need to completely finish a project no
06:28 - the idea being start something
06:30 - independently and get as much done as
06:33 - you can and figure things out as you go
06:35 - you're gonna realize like you like a lot
06:37 - of people say well it's too overwhelming
06:38 - like
06:39 - look they think of a project and like
06:40 - well I don't know how to do that like
06:41 - and they don't even start just start
06:43 - literally just started that's that's my
06:46 - tip just start doing something you don't
06:47 - need to finish it you don't need to look
06:49 - at the project and say well I don't know
06:50 - how to do this this this and this look
06:52 - at a project that you want to complete
06:53 - and say I know how to do this I'm okay
06:56 - at that I'm not sure about this area so
06:59 - let's start with what I do know let's
07:01 - finish that aspect and then let's start
07:03 - looking things up and building the rest
07:05 - of the project from there that you don't
07:07 - know how to do and that's what I've
07:08 - personally done that's how I learned a
07:10 - lot of things is I learn the basics from
07:12 - tutorials and then I pick some project
07:15 - something really simple it could be
07:16 - tic-tac-toe you know it doesn't need to
07:17 - be these massive huge projects and just
07:20 - start working on them and as soon as I
07:21 - hit a road bump I take a step back and I
07:23 - look up exactly what I need for that
07:26 - road bump learn it and then I never
07:27 - forget that because I've applied that to
07:30 - the project I've applied my learning and
07:31 - now you know I'm stepping out of the
07:33 - tutorial hell or what I'm doing is I'm
07:35 - taking the value and the information
07:37 - from that tutorial and applying it to
07:38 - something and that's what you need to do
07:40 - and if you want ideas for projects I
07:42 - have all kinds of videos I really have
07:44 - like five or six videos that just talk
07:45 - about Python projects to work on so
07:48 - please just work on projects work on
07:50 - something another good way you could try
07:52 - to do this is even working on
07:53 - programming problems like going to a
07:54 - site like leak code and trying to do
07:56 - easy problems that will allow you at
07:58 - least to start thinking cuz what you
08:00 - want to really train yourself to do is
08:02 - be able to think not just how to write
08:04 - the code down which is what I think a
08:06 - lot of people get lost with programming
08:07 - is a lot more about how your brain
08:09 - functions and tackles problems then it
08:11 - is about actually just typing the code
08:13 - out in you know a word doc you manner in
08:15 - an IDE or something like that so that's
08:17 - my tips for that awesome all right next
08:19 - question coming from Victor here he says
08:20 - hey Tim I'm a 15 year old programmer and
08:22 - not sure what I should do next
08:24 - I've been coding for half a year and I
08:25 - feel alright in Python and I'm wondering
08:27 - what I should do next
08:28 - some say that it's a good idea to learn
08:30 - C but I don't know what do you think
08:31 - what what did you do at that age what
08:34 - should I do next so this is gonna go
08:35 - back to something I talked about earlier
08:36 - do things that you find are fun do stuff
08:39 - that you want to do I mean like it's
08:41 - great to go online and to even ask me a
08:43 - question like that what should you do
08:45 - next but I think at an age like that
08:47 - what you really should be doing is
08:49 - solidifying the fundamentals and doing
08:52 - things that you find are fun like this
08:54 - is the time in your life where no one's
08:55 - telling you what to program you don't
08:57 - have any what you might but you probably
08:58 - don't have any like programming
08:59 - assignments you probably have a lot of
09:01 - free time so do some stuff that you like
09:03 - you know enjoy yourself program get into
09:05 - it if I just literally like killed
09:07 - myself doing programming questions when
09:09 - I was young like 1516 and was just
09:11 - preparing for the Microsoft interview
09:13 - the Google interview the whole time I
09:15 - probably wouldn't be programming right
09:16 - now or I wouldn't like it as much
09:18 - because it's just you know you put
09:19 - yourself through hell doing stuff you
09:20 - don't like so don't focus right now when
09:22 - you're 15 like it is great to think
09:24 - about the future and what you should
09:25 - learn but don't focus on like hey what
09:27 - language do I need to do next like how
09:28 - should I do this focus on doing things
09:30 - you enjoy so if you enjoy learning a new
09:32 - language or you want to get back into
09:34 - the journey of like being a beginner in
09:36 - C and you know really learning the
09:38 - fundamentals and understanding how I
09:41 - guess like a more complex language works
09:43 - then sure go ahead and do that but if
09:45 - you're someone who wants to make games
09:46 - if you want to experiment with AI and
09:48 - m/l like do that you know if you want to
09:50 - do web development do something like
09:51 - that so that's my advice to you figure
09:53 - out what you like and if you don't like
09:54 - something taste a few different things
09:55 - try C for a week then try JavaScript for
09:58 - a week and then try making a website
10:00 - like try all these different things
10:02 - that's what I did when I was your age I
10:04 - tried app development I tried websites I
10:06 - tried a I I tried games I tried
10:08 - literally everything until I found what
10:09 - I liked and that is what I would
10:11 - recommend to you awesome all right so
10:13 - next question also coming from YouTube
10:15 - another top comment how did you learn
10:17 - machine learning and neural network on
10:18 - your own and what are the resources that
10:20 - you use specifically for those yeah so
10:22 - that's a good question um this is hard
10:24 - because I've been learning this over a
10:25 - really long time where like in my spare
10:27 - time I'll just read up a little bit
10:29 - about neural networks or just you know
10:30 - understand a little bit more I started
10:32 - learning getting really into machine
10:34 - learning in like the end of grade 12
10:35 - like beginning of first year and the way
10:38 - I learned this was fundamentally from
10:39 - being a good programmer because I was a
10:42 - good programmer the only things I need
10:44 - to tackle when I want to start learning
10:45 - those was just the math and just
10:47 - understanding what these things do and
10:49 - there's all kinds of resource online
10:50 - like literally what I would do is read
10:52 - Wikipedia articles and Wikipedia pages
10:54 - they discuss how a neural network
10:57 - operates for me I'd much rather take
11:00 - like a short text article I guess what
11:02 - Kapiti is not sure but just take some
11:03 - article read
11:05 - skim it get the valuable information and
11:08 - then pick specific topics from that
11:10 - article that I want to learn more about
11:11 - and research them so I can't really give
11:14 - you like a formal guide on like yeah
11:16 - this is how I learned machine learning
11:17 - and AI but what I did it was just took
11:20 - baby steps towards I said okay so what
11:23 - do I need to do for machine learning and
11:24 - AI all right here's some Python modules
11:26 - that do it let's check what tutorials
11:28 - they have on their website because
11:29 - that's probably a good method or a good
11:31 - like you know order to go in in terms of
11:33 - learning topics so I go to like the SK
11:35 - learn website and I would say all right
11:37 - there's like you know linear regression
11:39 - clustering k-means like these different
11:42 - topics I would say all right let's try
11:45 - to learn those and then one by one I
11:46 - would look those topics up understand
11:48 - what they do from like small like
11:49 - articles just randomly online there's no
11:51 - no one centralized resource here and
11:54 - then as soon as I felt comfortable that
11:55 - I understood them I would apply the
11:56 - algorithm in Python use one of those
11:59 - modules and then move on to the next one
12:00 - and that's just what I did and like
12:02 - something like neural networks for
12:03 - example a complex topic that was me over
12:05 - a few months just casually in my spare
12:07 - time reading Wikipedia articles there's
12:10 - a long car at I have okay let's you know
12:11 - watch a short video on what a neural
12:13 - network is and how it works and over
12:15 - time hearing a bunch of different people
12:17 - talk about it and having all these
12:18 - different resources that I've looked at
12:20 - allows me to compile a really good
12:22 - knowledge of how these things work
12:23 - because I'm getting perspectives from
12:25 - all over the place not just one resource
12:27 - so I can't give you one specific
12:28 - resource I can't say this is the best
12:30 - place to learn neural networks I will
12:32 - say my channel has a lot of resources
12:33 - that should at least introduce you to
12:35 - them but that is how I got into and how
12:38 - I learn it and really how I learn
12:39 - anything is just casually my spare time
12:41 - looking at things trying to come up with
12:43 - myself like build a curriculum for
12:45 - myself on what I need to learn and then
12:47 - diving into that curriculum and learning
12:49 - topic by topic in bit by bit like little
12:51 - parts until I can compile all that
12:53 - together and understand the topic as a
12:55 - whole so that's yeah my how I got into
12:57 - that how did Microsoft hire you how did
12:59 - they know about you and what was the
13:00 - interview like sure so how did Microsoft
13:04 - hire you those question one okay so how
13:06 - did they hire me that's kind of an
13:08 - interesting phrased question but
13:10 - essentially I got an interview like
13:12 - somewhat through YouTube so someone
13:13 - through my from Microsoft actually
13:15 - reached out to me for an unrelated
13:16 - matter like they
13:17 - hire me for a job they just wanted to
13:19 - ask me a few questions about my youtube
13:21 - channel and my preference in terms of
13:22 - actually I des so why I wasn't using BS
13:25 - code in my videos so I responded to them
13:28 - eventually at the end of like a long
13:29 - email chain we had a really good
13:31 - conversation I said hey do you know any
13:32 - recruiters he said yeah hooked me up
13:34 - with one of them past the interviews and
13:36 - that's how I got a job at Microsoft how
13:38 - are the interviews the interviews were
13:39 - tough I won't lie the first interview I
13:41 - had on the phone was very easy super
13:44 - trivial problem even like a beginner
13:46 - programmer should hopefully be able to
13:48 - understand and explain and do the
13:50 - problem that I had but the on-site
13:52 - interviews I had so I had three of those
13:54 - so one phone screen and three on-site
13:56 - interviews we're definitely tough the
13:58 - first question I had was like you know a
13:59 - medium based question again I've talked
14:01 - about this a ton in other podcast as
14:03 - well but just like a medium programming
14:05 - question something you should have been
14:06 - prepared for it which I was which I
14:08 - answered pretty easily second question I
14:10 - had was like kind of a design question
14:11 - so designing minesweeper that was not a
14:14 - difficult problem but it was more of a
14:16 - design problem so it was how do you
14:17 - approach that how do you create the
14:19 - classes what is your thought process
14:21 - more than getting like a specific answer
14:23 - someone was interesting I thought I mean
14:26 - I did well in that interview things went
14:27 - well and then the last interview I had
14:29 - was the hardest one by far I know people
14:32 - say like oh you know if someone says
14:34 - they got a leak code hard for their
14:35 - interview it was actually a medium I
14:37 - promise you guys the question I got was
14:39 - a difficult question like I rank it as a
14:41 - leak code hard if it was on algo expert
14:43 - head ranked it as a very hard question I
14:45 - can't share it with you because the
14:47 - person who asked it to me has like this
14:48 - is their own question they've created so
14:50 - I can't tell you about that specific
14:52 - question or what it was but it was like
14:54 - a recursive some kind of recursive
14:56 - algorithm that was just very tough to
14:58 - implement so anyways that was how my
14:59 - interviews were they were stressful it
15:01 - was three in a row and they're each an
15:03 - hour so I had like you know two or three
15:05 - minute break between the interviews I so
15:07 - just imagine you know speaking and
15:09 - writing out code on the whiteboard for
15:10 - that amount of time you know gets
15:11 - stressful but I was well prepared did
15:13 - well and obviously you know I got hired
15:15 - so I think that answered all the
15:16 - questions oh yeah he actually has two
15:18 - more oh wow okay yeah yeah three parts
15:21 - so could you recommend some resources
15:22 - about Python not only documentation and
15:25 - courses but also about practice okay so
15:28 - resources for Python this one is always
15:29 - interesting because some people think I
15:31 - just
15:31 - like a library in my house and I just
15:32 - read like amazing crazy amounts of
15:35 - Python books I really don't read many
15:36 - books at all I've started doing that
15:38 - more now I understand the value behind
15:40 - that in terms of resources for me I've
15:42 - always just been someone who just went
15:44 - and figured stuff out like for me I
15:46 - learned how to make iOS ops when I was
15:47 - like 15 not by ever watching an iOS
15:50 - tutorial but by literally just booting
15:52 - up Xcode and then whatever I needed to
15:53 - do something just looking up
15:55 - specifically how to do that Python was
15:57 - similar I mean I learned that in high
15:59 - school through a formal class but I also
16:01 - just did
16:02 - I think it's called code Academy to
16:04 - learn the very basics so that's usually
16:06 - what I'll do is I'll watch like a
16:08 - tutorial series in two x speed or go
16:10 - through like a quick language recap or
16:13 - something like that just because I'm so
16:16 - good now at picking up languages I know
16:17 - the fundamentals so well that I don't
16:19 - need you know like a five hour course to
16:22 - teach me a language I just need to see
16:23 - the syntax and then practice it so I
16:26 - can't really recommend you any resources
16:27 - I mean like online is literally what I
16:29 - say just if you want to learn something
16:30 - just google it find resources that work
16:33 - well for you because it's different for
16:34 - everyone so I'm sorry if I can't give
16:36 - you more help with that but that's my
16:37 - way of learning things it's just going
16:39 - online finding resources that I find it
16:41 - valuable for me that aren't necessarily
16:43 - valuable for you and I know my style of
16:45 - learning really well so I can pick that
16:46 - out really easily but my resources are
16:48 - probably not gonna be the same thing
16:50 - that you would want to use if you were
16:51 - starting right from the very beginning I
16:53 - mean unless you're just watching like my
16:54 - tutorial videos or something like that
