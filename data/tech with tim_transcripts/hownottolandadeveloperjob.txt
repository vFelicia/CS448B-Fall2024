00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - so about a month ago i told all of you
00:10 - that my tech startup velocity was hiring
00:13 - software engineers specifically game
00:15 - developers now i received hundreds of
00:17 - applications for this role and thank you
00:19 - to everyone who applied i personally
00:21 - read through every single application
00:23 - and i'm still going through them today
00:25 - now i'm not going to lie to you guys i
00:26 - was pretty disappointed in the quality
00:28 - of applicant and just the amount of
00:30 - effort that went into the applications
00:32 - so much so that i felt the need to make
00:34 - this video and share with you all of the
00:36 - things that you should never do if you
00:38 - want to get hired by a tech company or
00:40 - even get an email response these are
00:42 - really simple things in some cases
00:44 - they're single words that you just
00:45 - shouldn't include in your application
00:47 - and i guarantee if you follow what i say
00:49 - in this video you're gonna have a much
00:51 - higher chance of actually getting an
00:52 - interview and getting some response
00:54 - based on your applications again i don't
00:56 - want to single any of you out here but i
00:58 - really think that i can help you because
01:00 - a lot of these applications i'm talking
01:02 - about ninety percent of the applications
01:03 - i received i was able to rule out in
01:05 - about five or ten seconds of reading
01:07 - through them and i really wanted to hire
01:09 - game developers i wanted to hire as many
01:11 - of you as i could but some of you just
01:12 - made it completely impossible for me to
01:14 - even consider you so with that said
01:16 - let's get into the video and i'll share
01:18 - with you what you should never do if you
01:19 - want to get hired by a tech company but

02:12 - in the description thanks again design
02:14 - now for sponsoring this video alright so
02:16 - let's start here with first impressions
02:18 - now obviously first impressions are very
02:20 - important but they are especially
02:22 - important when you are trying to stand
02:23 - out from hundreds of other people and
02:25 - you have someone like me who doesn't
02:27 - want to spend 10 hours reading every
02:29 - single aspect of an application so what
02:31 - you need to understand about say a
02:33 - manual review process here of applicants
02:35 - which a lot of smaller companies like my
02:37 - company is doing is that as the person
02:40 - reviewing your application i am going to
02:42 - take any opportunity i can to move your
02:44 - application into the trash pile the
02:46 - reason for that is i want less
02:47 - applications to review and i want to
02:49 - narrow down all of the possible
02:51 - applicants before i start reading into
02:53 - all of their applications more in depth
02:55 - i'd rather really quickly scan through
02:57 - 300 applications then look more in depth
02:59 - at say 20 or 30 of them before maybe
03:02 - reaching out and contacting a few people
03:04 - then read every single application all
03:06 - the way through so if you give me a
03:08 - reason why i can move your application
03:10 - into the trash pile i'm going to do that
03:12 - so what am i talking about when i say
03:13 - this well a lot of you in the first
03:15 - sentence of let's say the long answer
03:17 - aspect of the application where i asked
03:19 - you something like what's your
03:20 - experience or what are some games that
03:22 - you've built in the past you started
03:24 - very first sentence first impression
03:26 - saying i have no experience i am just
03:28 - beginning i am a beginner i don't know
03:31 - react i don't know javascript i don't
03:33 - know this i'm not good at this or
03:35 - alternatively you said something like i
03:37 - want this job because or i want to work
03:39 - with tim or i'm looking forward to
03:41 - working in a tech startup now all of
03:44 - those things are not necessarily bad to
03:45 - say but they're not the first thing that
03:47 - you should lead off with when you're
03:49 - trying to grab someone's attention for
03:51 - me for example as soon as i read the
03:52 - word beginner if that was in the first
03:54 - or second sentence of your application i
03:56 - immediately put it into the trash
03:57 - because even though yes you may be
03:59 - someone that i could train you may be
04:00 - someone that's going to be a great
04:02 - member of the team and really committed
04:04 - right now as a tech startup we're not
04:05 - looking for beginners we're looking for
04:07 - people that are confident people that
04:08 - know what they're doing and people that
04:10 - want to work and that i don't have to
04:11 - handhold when they're building different
04:13 - games now this goes with another section
04:15 - of this video which is knowing the role
04:17 - but you don't want to start out with
04:18 - something negative or something that
04:20 - gives someone a reason to discredit you
04:22 - or to move you away from the possible
04:24 - applicant pile you want to start with
04:26 - something along the lines of i have
04:27 - experience in react in javascript i'm
04:30 - confident that i would be a good
04:32 - person for this role you want to do
04:33 - something that gives some passion that
04:35 - gives some energy that shares experience
04:38 - that gives me a reason to continue
04:40 - reading your application and if you can
04:41 - make it unique that's great for example
04:44 - all of the applications that started
04:45 - with something like i'm an athlete
04:47 - myself as well as a programmer i read
04:49 - the entire application the reason for
04:50 - that is that the company that we're
04:52 - building has to do with athletics so if
04:54 - you're someone who's an athlete and you
04:56 - know at a program i'm interested in you
04:58 - because even if i can't use you as a
04:59 - software engineer maybe you have some
05:01 - other role in the company so that's what
05:02 - i'm talking about here you want to build
05:04 - a good first impression and you want to
05:06 - avoid putting anything in the first few
05:08 - lines of your application that allows
05:10 - someone to stop reading the application
05:12 - or kind of rule you out due to a red
05:14 - flag alright so moving on to section two
05:16 - here which is projects now once i've
05:19 - gone through kind of the basic text of
05:21 - your application i'm gonna start
05:22 - clicking on links i'm going to look at
05:23 - your linkedin i'm going to look at
05:24 - different projects and i want to get a
05:26 - sense of what you're able to do so with
05:28 - projects here so many of you submitted
05:30 - projects that were not relevant at all
05:32 - to the role so you submitted stuff that
05:33 - was like a machine learning application
05:35 - or a python app or something that just
05:37 - was not a game or didn't show the
05:39 - ability to work with html css javascript
05:42 - etc which was listed under the job
05:44 - requirements so if you submitted any
05:46 - project even if you submitted five
05:47 - projects and one of the projects you
05:49 - submitted was completely irrelevant to
05:51 - what we asked you to submit i'm crossing
05:53 - you off because if that's one of the
05:54 - best projects you have and it's not even
05:56 - relevant to the role it's another reason
05:58 - for me to get rid of you right now with
06:00 - the projects a lot of you also submitted
06:02 - just super basic projects you submitted
06:05 - stuff that anyone was able to do it's
06:06 - been a tic-tac-toe application you
06:08 - submitted stuff that was just ripped
06:10 - from my tutorials or ripped from other
06:11 - people's tutorials right that was just
06:13 - almost the exact same code not that i
06:15 - went and looked at the code but i just
06:16 - knew looking at the project how you came
06:18 - up with this you didn't submit anything
06:20 - that was original at all right so if you
06:22 - did that again immediately i've just
06:24 - crossed you off of the list here
06:25 - continuing some people submitted like 20
06:28 - projects you submit 20 projects i'm not
06:30 - going to go look at all 20 projects i'm
06:32 - going to look at maybe the first three
06:33 - i'm going to click on a few random ones
06:35 - so if coincidentally the one that i
06:37 - clicked on looks really bad that's too
06:38 - bad right so i'm fortunate because now
06:40 - that's the impression that i've got of
06:42 - one of the three projects that i looked
06:44 - at so what i would recommend for the
06:45 - projects here is make sure you're only
06:47 - submitting at most i'd say like three
06:50 - projects on something like this that the
06:52 - projects are relevant to what the role
06:54 - actually is so in this case they're
06:55 - games or they show you have the ability
06:57 - to make games or they're a really
06:59 - polished portfolio website or react
07:01 - website and that all of the projects you
07:04 - submit look really good are completely
07:06 - polished are things that could be a
07:08 - production application
07:09 - also all of the projects need to be
07:11 - click and run they can't be things where
07:13 - i got to download the github repository
07:15 - i got to build the npm packages i got to
07:17 - host it on localhost if you do something
07:20 - like that i'm just not going to do that
07:21 - that's too much effort for me to go
07:23 - through just to find out that oh this is
07:25 - from a tutorial or you're not even going
07:27 - to be the person that i end up
07:28 - interviewing so you have to understand
07:29 - again from the interview perspective i
07:31 - want it to be as easy for me as possible
07:33 - to look at your application and get rid
07:35 - of it so don't make it easy for me to do
07:37 - that make it really hard give me a
07:38 - really polished project give me two
07:40 - really polished projects
07:42 - do a few really good games or show me
07:44 - that you have the ability to do that as
07:46 - soon as i see that now i'm excited and i
07:48 - want to look through the rest of your
07:49 - application and i'm kind of rooting for
07:51 - you at this point right after looking
07:52 - through hundreds of really really bad
07:54 - applications so that's what i have on
07:56 - projects again the first impression of
07:58 - projects is super important they need to
08:00 - look good they need to be relevant they
08:02 - can't be simple or trivial and you don't
08:04 - need to submit 100 of them if you submit
08:06 - 100 i'm not going to look through all of
08:07 - them i'm only going to look through two
08:09 - or three anyways so pick your two or
08:10 - three best ones and put those forward
08:12 - all right so next section here is on
08:14 - confidence
08:15 - self doubt now when i was reading these
08:17 - applications one of the tones i was kind
08:19 - of looking for in your writing was
08:21 - confidence the fact that you had the
08:23 - ability to do the job you knew you could
08:25 - do the job there wasn't any doubt that
08:27 - you were going to be able to fulfill the
08:29 - role that you were going to be able to
08:30 - complete what was being asked of you as
08:32 - soon as there was even a little hint
08:34 - that you weren't sure of yourself that
08:36 - you didn't quite know if you were going
08:37 - to have the the skills or the chops for
08:39 - lack of a better word to complete the
08:40 - job again i had to throw your
08:42 - application out unfortunately in this
08:44 - type of role i can't be someone who's
08:46 - motivating you or training you
08:48 - constantly or hand holding you through
08:50 - what you need to do this isn't something
08:52 - where we're trying to ramp someone up
08:53 - over a few months this is a role where
08:55 - we need someone to come in and finish
08:57 - the job without really any help at all
09:00 - yes i can give you you know a few
09:01 - minutes a day or i can you know walk
09:03 - through how to set up the repository or
09:04 - something but beyond that there can't be
09:07 - a kind of reliance on someone else or
09:09 - this you know doubt of ability so just a
09:11 - note there you want to be confident
09:13 - obviously you don't want to overstep and
09:14 - become super arrogant in your
09:16 - application but honestly i would rather
09:18 - read an application from someone who
09:19 - knows what they're doing who says yes
09:20 - i'm a professional i make games this is
09:22 - what i do i have this much experience i
09:24 - absolutely can complete this job as
09:26 - opposed to someone saying well i'm just
09:28 - getting started and you know i'm really
09:30 - motivated about learning i want to join
09:31 - the company i want to work with tim and
09:34 - they just this kind of hint of
09:35 - self-doubt right they're not giving me
09:37 - this confidence it's not giving me the
09:38 - fact that they know how to do this
09:40 - they're saying well i think i can figure
09:41 - it out and that's great for a lot of
09:43 - other types of roles but i don't want
09:44 - someone who thinks i want someone who
09:46 - knows all right so next section here is
09:47 - to give more than you take now this is
09:50 - in really any area of life you are going
09:52 - to be attracted to someone if you offer
09:54 - them more than you are going to take
09:56 - from them this is the case in
09:58 - relationships this is the case in
09:59 - employment agreements this is the case
10:01 - in any type of relationship that you
10:03 - have with a seller with a company
10:05 - however it may be there's always some
10:07 - reciprocation right and people don't
10:08 - want to be in relationships where
10:10 - they're giving more than they are
10:12 - getting from the other person and they
10:13 - feel there's not a accurate say value
10:16 - exchange or i guess a fair value
10:18 - exchange so when you are trying to get a
10:21 - job what you want to be doing is saying
10:23 - this is what i'm going to give you this
10:24 - is what i can give to the company this
10:26 - is how i'm going to be an asset this is
10:28 - how i can help you you do not want to be
10:29 - saying this is what i want from the
10:31 - company some companies will ask you that
10:33 - and it's fine to answer and you can give
10:35 - some answers to that but you want to be
10:37 - very careful how you phrase that because
10:38 - the last thing i want to do is hire
10:40 - someone who just wants to work with me
10:41 - and just wants to talk to me all day or
10:44 - just wants to learn that's all they want
10:46 - to do right they just want to get
10:47 - experience in a startup they don't want
10:48 - to help us build games they don't want
10:50 - to help take this company to another
10:51 - level right they're not saying those
10:53 - things they're saying this is what i
10:54 - want from the company not this is what
10:56 - i'm going to give you and this is what
10:57 - i'm going to do for you even if you do
10:59 - want those things the most likely way to
11:01 - get them is to first state what you're
11:03 - going to offer and then later on you
11:05 - sprinkle in a little bit of okay this is
11:07 - why i'm interested this is why i want to
11:08 - work from you it's a balance and you
11:10 - need to make sure you are giving more
11:12 - than you are taking otherwise like in
11:14 - anything people don't want to have a
11:15 - relationship with you especially
11:17 - employees so hopefully this is making a
11:18 - bit of sense general rule in life if
11:20 - you're trying to sell something to
11:21 - someone give them more than you are
11:23 - asking from them that's the only reason
11:25 - someone would buy a product from you
11:26 - they think they're getting more than how
11:28 - much money they're giving you for the
11:30 - product right or they think it's a fair
11:31 - value exchange so with that said let's
11:33 - move on to the next section all right so
11:35 - last section here and i can't even
11:36 - believe i'm saying this but you need to
11:38 - know the role when you are applying for
11:40 - a job you have to craft your application
11:42 - around the specific role and understand
11:45 - that every company is looking for
11:46 - something slightly different and you
11:48 - want to make your application appear as
11:50 - though you are the ideal candidate for
11:52 - this specific role not any software
11:55 - developer role not any game developer
11:57 - role this specific role so that is why i
12:00 - was telling you before that a lot of the
12:02 - applications said i'm a beginner or i
12:03 - want to learn or i'll work for free i
12:05 - didn't even read through because that's
12:06 - not what we're looking for for this role
12:08 - i don't care if you work for free or if
12:10 - i have to pay you i just need this to
12:11 - get done so if you tell me i'm a
12:12 - beginner but i'll work for free i can't
12:14 - hire you that's more of a burden on me
12:16 - than it is if i just pay someone to do
12:18 - the job right so you need to read
12:20 - through the rule you need to completely
12:22 - understand it you need to accept the
12:23 - fact that maybe you aren't the ideal
12:25 - candidate and if that's the scenario
12:27 - maybe you don't apply or you omit saying
12:29 - a few things that just make you seem a
12:31 - lot worse uh than they do better right
12:34 - so kind of this whole section here just
12:36 - understand the role do some research you
12:38 - should have watched through the five
12:39 - minute video you should have read
12:41 - through the application online you
12:42 - should have tried to understand or put
12:44 - yourself in the shoes of me who's going
12:46 - to be hiring you and say what does tim
12:47 - want here does tim want to train someone
12:49 - for six months to learn how to do this
12:51 - or does tim want someone who can come in
12:53 - and complete the games hopefully the
12:54 - tone of my video would have you know
12:56 - kind of set that and explain that to you
12:58 - maybe that's my fault for not clearly
12:59 - articulating that but you want to put
13:01 - yourself in the shoes of the employer
13:02 - and say would i hire me right now
13:04 - writing this application am i the ideal
13:06 - candidate based on what i've written
13:08 - here and again i want to be clear i'm
13:09 - not saying lie i'm not saying to be
13:11 - untruthful or deceitful i'm just saying
13:13 - that there's a lot of times where you
13:14 - don't need to say something in the
13:16 - application and saying it is just going
13:18 - to hurt you a lot more than it's gonna
13:19 - help so with that said i think i'm gonna
13:20 - wrap it up here i hope this was not
13:22 - hurtful i hope you guys didn't take this
13:24 - personally i genuinely want to help you
13:26 - here i know a lot of you can be great
13:28 - software engineers you can be great in
13:30 - the role that you're talking about and
13:32 - that you probably would have been good
13:33 - for this company
13:34 - however some of the things you said were
13:35 - just too big of a red flag for me to
13:37 - take the risk at even interviewing you
13:39 - and spend that time and that's why i
13:41 - wanted to make this video so hopefully
13:43 - in the future you're going to have more
13:44 - luck and you can take some of this to
13:46 - heart and really consider it the next
13:47 - time you're writing an application where
13:49 - you're applying for any type of company
13:51 - so with that said i hope you guys
13:52 - enjoyed if you did make sure to leave a
13:54 - like subscribe to the channel and i will
13:55 - see you in the next one
13:58 - [Music]
14:04 - you
