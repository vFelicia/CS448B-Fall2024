00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back so in
00:01 - this video I will be doing a demo of my
00:03 - first ever Android application now this
00:06 - Android app was built for school so as
00:08 - most of you know I'm a computer science
00:10 - student I'm actually enrolled in a
00:11 - software engineering class this semester
00:13 - and our final project for this class was
00:16 - to create this exact application so
00:18 - every group had to create the same app a
00:20 - walk-in clinic organizer you guys will
00:22 - see how this works there's three main
00:24 - users that we had to accommodate here so
00:25 - an admin user an employee user and a
00:28 - patient user and I'll talk about the
00:29 - responsibilities of each of those users
00:31 - as we kind of go in and talk more about
00:33 - the application I will say actually did
00:35 - build this with four other students so
00:38 - most of the other students did a lot of
00:39 - the UI stuff and kind of the
00:40 - lighter-weight back and work whereas my
00:42 - main responsibility was doing the more
00:44 - kind of intense back-end stuff that was
00:46 - a bit more difficult as well as all of
00:48 - the database components and I would say
00:50 - that I probably wrote a lot of the code
00:52 - that you guys gonna see in the github
00:54 - repository that I've linked down below
00:55 - for this project also if you guys would
00:57 - like to run this app there is an APK
00:59 - down there so if you have an android
01:00 - phone or you just want to try it on
01:01 - android studio you're more than welcome
01:03 - to do that and in case I didn't mention
01:05 - that this is written in Java
01:07 - alright so let's actually just get in
01:08 - and start looking at the application so
01:10 - I'm gonna start from the administrator
01:11 - user and then go to the employee user
01:13 - and the patient user which is our three
01:15 - users for this application and talk
01:17 - about what each can do so this is our
01:19 - admin log and I'm gonna blur it out
01:21 - because you guys can actually log in if
01:23 - you see that and our admin has two main
01:25 - things that it can do it can create
01:27 - modify and delete services that can be
01:29 - offered by the different walking clinics
01:31 - and it can view and delete the different
01:34 - users of this actual walking clinic app
01:36 - so here you can see this is a list of
01:39 - all the users coincidentally they're all
01:40 - named Tim because those obviously is me
01:42 - that's doing the user there and here is
01:45 - a list of all the services and they can
01:47 - be offered by the walking clinic now if
01:48 - I hard press on one of these services I
01:50 - can actually modify them so I could
01:51 - change this to be something like I don't
01:53 - know checkup or whatever like that we'll
01:57 - do an exclamation point that can be
01:59 - performed by a doctor I can update that
02:01 - and now you see we have that there and
02:03 - then obviously I can add services by
02:05 - putting them up here choosing who
02:07 - performs them and clicking at now this
02:09 - is useful use this allows the admin to
02:11 - kind of moderate which services
02:13 - are allowed to be offered by the
02:14 - different walking clinics okay so that
02:16 - is our admin user now the next user that
02:19 - I'm going to talk about is our employee
02:20 - user so actually login as one that I've
02:22 - already created just to save us a bit of
02:24 - time here and you can see that this is
02:27 - our employee on user kind of interface
02:29 - so we have a profile hours services and
02:33 - working hours so essentially kind of the
02:35 - theory behind this is each employee is
02:37 - responsible for one walking clinic and
02:40 - they're responsible for setting up that
02:41 - clinic profile so information say about
02:44 - like you know the road or the street
02:46 - address that this clinic is on as well
02:48 - as the phone number for the clinic and
02:49 - the name you know I can change this
02:51 - clinic name to just be cool clinic or
02:53 - something like that so we can see which
02:55 - one this is
02:55 - I can change the accepted payment
02:57 - methods and notice obviously we'll have
03:00 - some checks here so like let's say I
03:01 - don't enter a valid phone number then
03:03 - and I click Save please choose that one
03:06 - okay let's choose one of those now it
03:08 - should give us the pop-up message
03:09 - invalid phone number so there's checks
03:11 - to make sure all this works and if I
03:12 - click on this little trigger icon
03:14 - whatever this we want to call that will
03:16 - actually open up Google Maps and show us
03:18 - the address of what we're talking about
03:19 - all right so let's go back here let's
03:21 - actually hit save for this clinic
03:23 - profile that's gonna save that in the
03:24 - database now which I'm going to show you
03:26 - guys later
03:26 - next we can actually configure the
03:28 - clinic working hours so this is the
03:30 - hours that the clinic will be open for
03:32 - so this is important obviously to be
03:33 - able to set now this was an interesting
03:36 - decision on how we were gonna do this
03:38 - because technically you know what clinic
03:40 - could be open some days you get closed
03:41 - for a holiday you could be open one week
03:44 - and then maybe on Friday next week you
03:46 - don't want to be open so what we decided
03:47 - to do was allow the user to set the
03:49 - working hours for the clinic using these
03:51 - little time Pickers and then decide if a
03:53 - day was open or closed by simply
03:54 - clicking open or closed on this little
03:56 - toggle on the side now that can
03:58 - obviously change every week you could go
04:01 - in whenever you want and close a day
04:02 - without actually modifying these hours
04:04 - but you know that's up to you so save
04:06 - we'll save that change for us obviously
04:08 - and then here this little bit
04:09 - information about how this works in case
04:11 - anyone's confused when using this page
04:13 - awesome so we updated those the next
04:16 - thing to talk about is the clinic
04:17 - services now clinic services needs to be
04:19 - added by the employee so essentially the
04:22 - employee says well what services do our
04:23 - walk-in clinic adds they can have a look
04:25 - at all the services that
04:26 - and be offered and they can long press
04:28 - on one of them if they'd like them to be
04:30 - offered by their clinic and we can see
04:31 - that these are the ones that are
04:32 - currently offered next we have working
04:35 - hours which is simply kind of similar to
04:37 - clinic hours but this is actually
04:39 - working hours of the specific employee
04:41 - that's using this application so they're
04:44 - setting kind of their own shift or their
04:46 - own schedule don't ask me why we need
04:48 - this it's just was part of the rubric
04:50 - that we need to follow when creating
04:51 - this app okay so lastly I'm actually
04:54 - gonna sign in as a patient employee now
04:57 - or a patient employee as a patient user
04:59 - oh that's not a login so let's actually
05:01 - just create a new account and I'll show
05:03 - you that feature as well so let's make
05:04 - our name you know patient like that we
05:08 - make our username Tim I should just make
05:10 - it P Tim like patient Tim and then
05:12 - Bertie is the famous password okay so
05:16 - that's a patient account we'll click
05:17 - that we've created this account now it
05:19 - says welcome P Tim you are logged in as
05:20 - a patient and as a patient we can do two
05:22 - things which is book appointments or we
05:24 - can view and rate past appointments so
05:27 - if I show you and I view appointments
05:29 - here currently we have nothing but if I
05:32 - go to book slash check-in I can view the
05:35 - list of different clinics I can actually
05:36 - search for clinics based on name if I
05:38 - wanted to so in this case let's go Tim
05:40 - you can see that now that actually is
05:42 - gonna filter out and give me this clinic
05:43 - and it shows the rating for this clinic
05:45 - I can also search by address as well as
05:47 - the days of operation so what days the
05:49 - clinic they are open for it but by
05:51 - default it starts by just showing me all
05:52 - clinics that are available okay so let's
05:54 - look at Tim's clinic here we can see
05:56 - that it's rated 3 stars I can click this
05:58 - little icon again if I want to see the
06:00 - address in Google Maps and then I have a
06:02 - current waiting time so if I were to go
06:04 - to that walking clinic now how long
06:06 - would I have to wait to be seen and that
06:07 - I'll talk about later
06:08 - sometimes this messes up a little bit
06:11 - but you can see the list of clinics that
06:13 - are here first time when you click on it
06:14 - sometimes it doesn't show up just a
06:16 - database like there and this is actually
06:18 - what I can use to book an appointment so
06:20 - I'm in my clinic I can view the
06:21 - information about it and if I'd like to
06:22 - book an appointment well I can choose a
06:24 - date so let's maybe choose you know
06:26 - Tuesday the 10th is when I want to book
06:28 - an appointment I'll choose a time if I
06:30 - try to hit save in a time that is not
06:32 - available it's gonna tell me clinic is
06:34 - closed at that time so let's make this
06:35 - available let's go
06:37 - you know 1026 a.m. will
06:39 - same and notice when I do that it
06:41 - actually automatically rounds my time to
06:43 - the nearest 15 minute interval because
06:45 - that is when we allow appointments to be
06:46 - booked
06:47 - next I can click booked appointment give
06:49 - that a second that's gonna book the
06:50 - appointment for me and now if I go into
06:52 - view appointments I can actually view my
06:54 - upcoming appointments and click on that
06:55 - for some information or decide to cancel
06:57 - the appointment if I like now I'm just
06:59 - gonna make an appointment in the past
07:01 - quickly and show you guys how it works
07:02 - to rating past appointments okay so now
07:05 - I'm going to show you a more advanced
07:06 - feature of kind of the clinic booking
07:09 - check-in process
07:10 - so essentially what I've actually done
07:11 - if I view my appointments I've booked
07:13 - another appointment here so I've booked
07:14 - one that's actually at 8:30 which is in
07:16 - two minutes from what it is right now
07:18 - and I just want to show you what happens
07:19 - when I go to try to book another
07:20 - appointment so if I go to cool clinic
07:22 - you can see that it gives us a current
07:24 - estimated waiting time of 16 minutes now
07:27 - the reason we get this is because
07:29 - currently it's 829 and the next
07:31 - appointment will be finished at 8:45
07:33 - because we booked one at 8:30 each
07:35 - appointment actually lasts 15 minutes so
07:37 - this is telling us essentially when is
07:39 - the next time from the current time that
07:41 - we could book another appointment that
07:42 - we could be seen so I think that that is
07:44 - pretty cool this is a feature that we
07:46 - needed to add it was mandatory for kind
07:48 - of a deliverable but to get it work
07:50 - properly with like time in the past and
07:52 - appointment stacking up is actually not
07:53 - as easy as it looks now I'm gonna go
07:55 - back to view appointments here and I'm
07:57 - gonna show you what happens as soon as
07:59 - this hits 8:30 where my appointments are
08:01 - actually gonna change so my appointment
08:03 - from the here that is you know at 8:30
08:05 - is actually gonna go into the past
08:07 - appointments page as soon as we hit 8:30
08:09 - all right so it's 8:30 now which means
08:11 - this appointment is officially in the
08:13 - past because you know it's actually just
08:15 - happened technically we could have made
08:16 - it at you know 8:45 once the
08:18 - appointments finished it goes in the
08:19 - past but I think this is more than fine
08:21 - and you can see that now when I have
08:23 - this past appointment there's a button
08:25 - that allows me to rape my service so how
08:27 - I felt that the service was so here you
08:29 - know this pumps up a little dialog I can
08:31 - choose the amount of stars I want to
08:32 - give this so maybe we'll give it five
08:33 - stars then it says you rated this five
08:36 - stars and if you click on it again you
08:38 - can see the rating that you gave it now
08:40 - I can also decide to remove this
08:42 - appointment from my list of past
08:44 - appointments so say I have a ton of
08:45 - different appointments here I can decide
08:47 - to remove that if I want to see you know
08:49 - my most recent ones or anything like
08:50 - that and then the
08:51 - upcoming appointment set on one anymore
08:53 - I can just cancel it by doing that
08:55 - alright so that has been 8 for my first
08:57 - ever Android application now don't get
08:59 - me wrong there's a ton of stuff that
09:01 - needs to be improved I'm gonna say right
09:03 - now for any of you guys that look at the
09:04 - github repository you were gonna be very
09:07 - disappointed when you read through the
09:08 - source code but I will say this project
09:10 - was on a deadline and kind of my last
09:12 - concern was writing good source code
09:14 - when you know I have a million things to
09:16 - do and all I need to do is finish this
09:17 - project so it's an absolute mess of a
09:19 - project you guys can read through it
09:21 - look at the source code if you want but
09:23 - please you know go easy on me because
09:25 - remember this is my first time building
09:26 - an Android app I had no plan and this is
09:28 - really just patch fixes whenever
09:30 - something went wrong anyways yeah that
09:32 - has been in I mean if you guys have made
09:34 - it this far let me know in the comments
09:36 - down below what you think of this app
09:37 - could I add anything to it is there
09:39 - anything that's really bad did you like
09:40 - something about it and are you
09:41 - interested in possibly building an
09:43 - Android app in the future
09:44 - personally I had a lot of fun doing this
09:46 - I learned a ton and I feel like I could
09:48 - go out there and build you know a proper
09:49 - Android oh now with the amount of
09:51 - knowledge that I've had so as always if
09:53 - you guys enjoyed leave a like on the
09:55 - video subscribe to the channel down
09:56 - below and if you want to run this app
09:57 - the github repository is in the
09:59 - description
