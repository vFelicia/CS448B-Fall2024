00:00 - you need to really narrow down why it is
00:02 - you want to learn how to code and
00:04 - specifically what you want to learn how
00:06 - to code what do you want to make what do
00:08 - you want to do with code why are you
00:10 - learning this maybe you want to do
00:11 - machine learning and AI maybe you want
00:13 - to get into data science maybe you want
00:15 - to do game development maybe you don't
00:17 - care and you just want to be a software
00:19 - engineer and get paid six figures these
00:21 - are kind of the general disciplines and
00:23 - domains that you're going to be picking
00:24 - between and so do some research figure
00:27 - out what really interests you and what
00:28 - you'd like to start with you can always

00:32 - going to learn first is going to be the
00:34 - one that's based on what you're actually
00:35 - going to want to make right what you
00:37 - want to complete what you want to do
00:38 - with your coding knowledge
