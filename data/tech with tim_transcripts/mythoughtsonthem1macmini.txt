00:00 - so the new m1 apple processors have been
00:02 - getting a ton of hype there's been a lot
00:04 - of great reviews for them
00:05 - and so i decided to pick up a new apple
00:07 - m1 mac
00:09 - mini now i've been using this machine
00:10 - for about three weeks i have some
00:12 - thoughts on it
00:13 - and hopefully in this short video i can
00:14 - summarize all of the great things
00:16 - and not so great things about this
00:17 - device and give my personal
00:19 - recommendation on whether or not i think
00:21 - you should buy one
00:22 - in 2021 with that said let's dive in
00:34 - so i picked up a new m1 mac mini about
00:36 - three weeks ago
00:37 - the configuration i went with had 16
00:39 - gigabytes of ram
00:40 - and one terabyte of ssd storage it ran
00:43 - me about 1650 canadian dollars
00:45 - now comparing that to the base model the
00:47 - base model has eight gigabytes of ram
00:49 - 256 gigabytes of ssd storage and starts
00:52 - at 900 canadian dollars
00:54 - so these machines are pretty affordable
00:56 - especially if you're comparing them to
00:58 - their pc counterparts
00:59 - and the level of performance that you're
01:00 - getting here for this price is actually
01:02 - very very good
01:03 - at kind of first glance if i'm giving
01:05 - you my initial impressions from using
01:06 - this machine
01:07 - i would recommend it to about 80 to 90
01:09 - percent of people
01:10 - unless you have some specific use cases
01:12 - which i'll discuss in this video
01:14 - so to really summarize this machine i
01:16 - kind of have three words
01:17 - fast new and silent now when i say this
01:21 - machine is fast
01:22 - what i really mean is it's extremely
01:24 - responsive when you are using this
01:26 - device
01:26 - it feels just like using an iphone or
01:28 - using an ipad when you open an app
01:30 - it opens instantly when you close an app
01:32 - it closes instantly
01:34 - when you're dragging things around when
01:35 - you're doing some kind of light work
01:37 - everything is just happening super fast
01:39 - genuinely faster than what's even
01:41 - happening on my like 10
01:42 - 000 big gaming pc that i have here that
01:44 - i'm recording this video on
01:46 - so this computer feels super fast and
01:48 - for anyone who's doing just kind of
01:50 - average work on your computer maybe
01:51 - you're in an excel spreadsheet maybe
01:53 - you're doing some word processing
01:54 - maybe you're reading email or on safari
01:57 - this is gonna feel like the fastest
01:58 - computer you've ever used
02:00 - especially if you haven't used an m1 mac
02:02 - mini before now when it comes to sheer
02:04 - processing power
02:05 - doing things like rendering and other
02:07 - performance heavy applications i haven't
02:08 - tested this machine too much
02:10 - it seems to be about on par with my old
02:12 - macbook pro 16 inch which had an i7
02:15 - 6 core processor in it so it's not like
02:18 - you're getting
02:18 - crazy crazy performance out of this
02:21 - processor here
02:22 - it's just that when you're doing the
02:23 - light work and you're doing kind of your
02:24 - average day-to-day tasks on this machine
02:26 - it's super fast super responsive and
02:29 - just feels great it's just really nice
02:30 - to work on really satisfying and really
02:32 - the best way i can kind of explain it is
02:34 - just to compare it to the experience you
02:36 - get
02:36 - when you use something like an iphone or
02:38 - an ipad again i can't talk too much
02:40 - about the sheer performance when you get
02:41 - into applications where you're doing
02:43 - video editing rendering audio processing
02:45 - and all of that
02:46 - but from my experience it's been about
02:48 - on par with the last generation
02:50 - 2016 macbook pro again that had that i7
02:54 - processor in it
02:55 - but that computer is about two times the
02:57 - price of this one
02:58 - right here and so the next point that i
03:00 - had here is that this machine is silent
03:02 - now when i say that i mean that
03:04 - literally i have yet to hear this device
03:06 - it makes such a low sound that i quite
03:09 - literally cannot hear anything
03:10 - unless i stick my ear right to the back
03:12 - of the i o
03:13 - and even then i can hardly hear any
03:15 - sound whatsoever
03:17 - now one of the reasons why this device
03:19 - is able to run so quietly
03:21 - to the point where i'm literally calling
03:22 - it silent is because
03:24 - it draws so little power i think the tdp
03:27 - of this entire machine
03:28 - is about 35 to 40 watts now to put that
03:31 - in comparison
03:32 - a computer with disk processing power
03:35 - that was a pc say you were to build this
03:36 - yourself
03:37 - would probably be drawing at minimum 200
03:40 - watts under load
03:41 - this device under full load is not
03:43 - drawing more than 35 to 40 watts at
03:45 - least
03:46 - according to apple and that's one of the
03:47 - reasons it's able to stay
03:49 - so quiet is it just taking in way less
03:51 - energy so it's producing
03:52 - way less heat and that way the fan can
03:55 - stay at a very consistent
03:56 - low level and it doesn't rev up i
03:58 - haven't heard it and this is one of the
03:59 - number one assets for me because i'm in
04:02 - kind of a studio environment here
04:03 - my old mac that i used to use to process
04:05 - all of my audio would rev the fan up
04:07 - really loud
04:08 - it was really annoying and it would kind
04:10 - of be picked up on my microphone as
04:12 - background noise
04:12 - and so this thing is great and one of
04:14 - the reasons why i bought it was because
04:16 - i heard about the volume of it
04:18 - and i was like i need to try this i want
04:19 - something silent and well it has not
04:21 - disappoint
04:22 - so that's something to note completely
04:23 - silent device that's just one of the
04:25 - biggest factors for me and why i'm
04:26 - mentioning it and i think probably one
04:28 - of the most underrated factors or things
04:30 - mentioned
04:31 - about these m1 processors not to mention
04:33 - the extremely low power draw
04:34 - so now moving on to the last point which
04:36 - is new now at the beginning of the video
04:38 - when i said new doesn't necessarily mean
04:40 - a good thing
04:41 - i meant that and the reason for that is
04:42 - that these chips are just so
04:44 - so new if you're unaware these m1
04:47 - processors are running a brand new
04:48 - architecture this is an
04:50 - arm architecture that's similar to
04:52 - what's running on your iphone
04:53 - or your ipad there's a ton of benefits
04:56 - in this architecture like you can run
04:57 - ios apps or ipad apps natively now on
05:00 - your mac operating system
05:02 - if you're an ios developer this is
05:03 - probably going to be really big deal for
05:05 - you and these machines are going to be
05:06 - great
05:07 - but if you're working with a lot of
05:09 - software that's maybe older software
05:11 - that's intel based it doesn't get
05:12 - updated that frequently or that has not
05:14 - yet been optimized for the m1 mac you
05:16 - are going to see a performance penalty
05:18 - and you may actually see
05:20 - some things that don't work at all with
05:22 - this m1 processor
05:23 - so the reason for this is whenever you
05:24 - design software you kind of have to
05:26 - design it based on a certain
05:27 - architecture
05:28 - and while most of the software out there
05:30 - for mac is designed for an intel
05:32 - architecture and has not yet been
05:33 - updated
05:34 - and that means if you want to run this
05:36 - software on your mac you need to install
05:38 - something called rosetta now in all
05:40 - credit to mac or to apple i guess they
05:42 - make it super simple to install this
05:44 - rosetta software it's literally a one
05:46 - click thing
05:46 - the first time you try to open an intel
05:48 - application it prompts you to install
05:50 - rosetta
05:51 - in anyways what rosetta will do is take
05:53 - this intel-based software
05:55 - and translate it into something that
05:57 - your m1 ship can understand
05:59 - however this does cost you as i said
06:01 - about 50 performance penalty now that's
06:03 - a rough estimate it's going to change
06:04 - based on the application that you're
06:06 - using
06:06 - but if you are using an application that
06:08 - is not built natively for m1
06:10 - expect it not to perform to the same
06:12 - level as anything that obviously has
06:14 - been optimized for that chip
06:15 - now as i said this also means there's a
06:17 - lot of stuff that just doesn't work
06:19 - on m1 processors for example i have a
06:21 - ton of plugins for my audio recording in
06:24 - logic pro which is like an audio
06:26 - software on mac and a bunch of those
06:27 - plugins just do not work
06:29 - at all i had to go through a ton of
06:31 - crazy work arounds it took me about five
06:33 - hours the first time i got this machine
06:34 - to get this working
06:36 - because they just were not compatible
06:37 - with the new m1 architecture
06:40 - so one thing you guys really need to
06:41 - make sure you look out for if you're
06:42 - buying this computer
06:43 - is that the software you use and you
06:45 - rely on is actually going to operate on
06:48 - it
06:48 - so make sure you do some research make
06:50 - sure you look into if this software
06:52 - actually works properly on the m1
06:54 - and if you can live with that kind of
06:55 - performance penalty that you're gonna
06:57 - get
06:58 - because of the fact that this is just so
07:00 - new and that companies have not yet had
07:01 - time
07:02 - to kind of transfer all of their
07:03 - software over to this new m1
07:05 - architecture
07:06 - so really that's going to wrap up my
07:08 - thoughts on this new
07:09 - m1 processor obviously this is not a
07:11 - full review i could talk about this for
07:13 - hours
07:13 - i just want to give you guys a quick
07:15 - summary and hopefully hit on some of the
07:16 - key points some of the selling points
07:18 - and drawbacks of this device to give you
07:21 - a quick summary here
07:22 - this is fast super responsive speedy and
07:24 - in my opinion probably one of the best
07:26 - value computers of 2021 especially if
07:28 - you're someone who's just an
07:30 - average user does some light work like i
07:32 - said you're using you know excel
07:34 - word mail google whatever but
07:37 - you do have to be wary that a lot of
07:39 - software does not run on this computer
07:41 - it's going to cause you a lot of
07:42 - headaches or if it does run it's gonna
07:44 - run at a performance penalty
07:46 - due to the fact it needs to be
07:47 - translated to the new m1 architecture
07:49 - lastly the power draw of this computer
07:51 - is ridiculously low
07:53 - it is absolutely silent one of my
07:54 - favorite parts about the machine
07:56 - with that said i'm going to wrap up the
07:57 - video here so if you guys enjoyed make
07:59 - sure to leave a like
08:00 - subscribe to the channel i will see you
08:02 - in another youtube video
