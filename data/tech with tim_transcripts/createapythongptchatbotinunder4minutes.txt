00:00 - let's make a python chatbot using openai
00:02 - and chat gbt in just 5 minutes Step 1
00:06 - install the openai package we're going
00:08 - to go to a terminal and type pip install
00:10 - openai if you're on Mac or Linux you can
00:12 - try pip3 install openai I already have
00:15 - that installed once it's installed we'll
00:17 - import open Ai and we will set the
00:19 - openai API key so we'll say openai dot
00:22 - API underscore key is equal to a string
00:25 - and is that ever a mouthful now we need
00:27 - to get our API key to do that we need to
00:29 - go to the open AI website so this will
00:31 - be linked in the description
00:33 - platform.openai.com account slash API
00:37 - keys if you don't already have an
00:38 - account you will need to make one if you
00:40 - do you should be able to make a new API
00:42 - key here by clicking on create new
00:43 - secret giving it a name and then
00:45 - pressing on create secret key once the
00:48 - key is generated copy that key paste
00:50 - that into Python and we'll move on to
00:52 - the next step so I have my API key here
00:54 - I will delete this after the video and
00:56 - what we'll do now is create a function
00:57 - that we will call every time we want a
00:59 - new completion so we'll say chat with
01:01 - GPT we will take in some kind of prompt
01:04 - which will be the message from our user
01:06 - it will generate a response using a GPD
01:09 - model so we'll say open AI dot chat
01:13 - completion like so dot create inside of
01:17 - here we're going to specify our model
01:19 - the model that's available today as of
01:21 - filming this video is GPT 3.5 Dash turbo
01:25 - this will be the best one to use if you
01:27 - spell it correctly next we need to pass
01:29 - messages is equal to an array inside of
01:32 - the array we'll pass an object we'll say
01:34 - the rule is a user and we will say that
01:39 - the content is the prompt all you need
01:42 - to do is have this and now this will
01:44 - generate a completion for you now that
01:46 - we have the completion we need to return
01:47 - that to the user so we'll say return
01:50 - response dot choices at index zero Dot
01:55 - message dot content dot strip this will
01:59 - just remove any leading or trailing
02:00 - white space from the message now we'll
02:03 - say if underscore underscore name is
02:05 - equal to underscore underscore Main this
02:08 - means that we're running this python
02:09 - file directly we'll write a simple while
02:11 - loop that will prompt the user to keep
02:13 - asking the chatbot questions so we'll
02:16 - say well true
02:17 - inside of here we'll say the user input
02:19 - is equal to input and then we can do
02:22 - something like U colon we'll say if the
02:26 - user underscore input dot lower is in
02:29 - the following so quit
02:32 - exit or buy then what we'll do is simply
02:36 - break out of the while loop otherwise
02:38 - we'll generate a response so let's say
02:40 - response is equal to chat with GPT we
02:44 - will pass that user input and then we
02:46 - will print
02:47 - chatbot
02:49 - colon
02:50 - comma and then
02:53 - the response like that
02:56 - okay let's go ahead and test this out
02:58 - that's actually our completed Chapa to
03:00 - run the chatbot we'll go to our terminal
03:01 - here
03:02 - and we'll run the name of our python
03:04 - file in this case it's python main.pi
03:06 - I'm going to type in hello how are you
03:10 - and we will see here that we'll get a
03:12 - response hello I'm an AI so I don't have
03:13 - feelings but I'm here to assist you well
03:16 - can you lie
03:19 - to me at least
03:21 - let's see as an AI language model I'm
03:24 - programmed to provide accurate
03:25 - information okay
03:27 - bye
03:29 - and then we can leave by typing buy so
03:31 - there you go that was a python chatbot
03:33 - in under five minutes very simple to
03:36 - interact with open Ai and this is
03:37 - obviously quite powerful you can do a
03:39 - lot more than what I did here I'd love
03:41 - to hear what you do with this code in
03:42 - the comments down below let me know and
03:44 - I look forward to seeing you in another
03:46 - video
03:47 - [Music]
03:49 - foreign
03:50 - [Music]
