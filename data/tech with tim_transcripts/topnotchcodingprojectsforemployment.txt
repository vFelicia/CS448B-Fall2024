00:03 - foreign
00:11 - so if you're watching this video then
00:13 - chances are that you're a programmer and
00:15 - you're looking for a job or at least
00:16 - looking to work on some kind of projects
00:18 - that could Pat your resume so in this
00:20 - video I'm going to share with you a ton
00:22 - of different project ideas so that you
00:24 - have no excuse and you can go and start
00:26 - working on a project right after this
00:29 - video so first I want to share with you
00:31 - kind of a recipe or a checklist for
00:33 - programming projects so that you know
00:35 - you're working on something that's good
00:36 - and that has a higher chance of actually
00:38 - being seen viewed and hopefully help you
00:40 - get a job so when you're working on a
00:43 - programming project the first thing you
00:45 - need to do is make sure that this is
00:47 - going to be easy to run and easy to use
00:49 - what I mean by that is it can't have 20
00:51 - installation steps it can't take five
00:54 - minutes to get up and running it ideally
00:55 - should be a website it should be a
00:57 - one-click install it can maybe be like
00:59 - two or three terminal commands if it's a
01:01 - technical audience who's going to be
01:02 - looking at it but ideally you want it to
01:04 - be as easy to run and use as possible
01:06 - next you want to be kind of creative you
01:08 - want to do something ideally That's
01:09 - Unique if you're just following it's a
01:11 - tutorial if you're just building
01:12 - something that a hundred other people
01:14 - have built and that have put in the
01:15 - resume pile it's not going to stand out
01:17 - and even though it might be complicated
01:19 - and kind of impressive that you built
01:20 - it's still not as good as something
01:22 - that's more personal and kind of custom
01:23 - and ideally solve some kind of problem
01:26 - for you or someone else so that's the
01:28 - next step here if you can make it custom
01:30 - if you can make this apply to your
01:32 - everyday life it's going to be much
01:33 - easier for you to talk about in an
01:35 - interview setting and something that
01:37 - again is just kind of more creative it's
01:38 - more interesting to listen to than the
01:40 - 100th person explaining that they built
01:42 - a you know algorithm visualizer right
01:44 - which is a really popular programming
01:46 - project now next I'd say that whatever
01:48 - project you work on should imply that
01:50 - you have a deep knowledge of programming
01:52 - and that you're a good program right
01:54 - whatever you work on should seem
01:55 - complicated even if it's not the most
01:57 - complicated thing in the world it should
01:59 - seem like oh that must have been kind of
02:00 - hard to build or he must have had to do
02:02 - this this and this that's what you want
02:04 - people to get the sense of when they're
02:05 - looking at even like the name of the
02:07 - project because that's what's going to
02:08 - make it impressive now lastly any great
02:10 - project should have a great GitHub so
02:13 - you should have a really good readme it
02:14 - should be very presentable even just
02:16 - nice commit messages if someone is
02:18 - actually going to go and look at the
02:19 - source code it obviously should be nice
02:21 - and clean it should be well written it
02:23 - should have comments explaining it I
02:25 - wouldn't normally say like comment the
02:27 - crap out of your code but if you're
02:28 - going to have like a recruiter or an
02:30 - interviewer or something reading through
02:31 - it then you might want to spend a bit
02:32 - more time like prettifying the code and
02:35 - making it really easy to navigate and
02:36 - understand alright so that's kind of my
02:38 - recipe or checklist for programming
02:40 - projects now we'll get into a bunch of
02:42 - different ideas and categories of
02:44 - projects however if you are looking to
02:46 - host your programming project then you
02:48 - should check out the sponsor of this
02:50 - video before we get started I need to
02:52 - thank lenode for sponsoring this video
02:54 - I've been using and working with lenode
02:56 - for nearly three years now and they've
02:58 - consistently been my go-to choice for
03:00 - hosting my applications and servers in
03:02 - fact right now I'm using the node to
03:04 - host the official Tech with Tim Discord
03:06 - bot a website multiple of my domains and
03:08 - a kubernetes cluster now lenode was just
03:11 - recently acquired by Akamai and as a
03:13 - part of this acquisition they're going
03:14 - to be adding more than a dozen new data
03:16 - centers around the world in the next
03:18 - year lenode makes it super easy to spin
03:20 - up servers with their one-click app
03:22 - Marketplace and have tons of written
03:23 - guides and YouTube videos on their
03:25 - channel to help you get started now if
03:27 - you're having any issues you can reach
03:29 - out to the 24 7 support team and
03:31 - actually talk with a real human being
03:33 - now the node's pricing is simple with no
03:35 - hidden fees and full transparency and
03:37 - you can test out the node services for
03:39 - free by using the link in the
03:41 - description and claiming in a 100.60 day
03:43 - credit for any new accounts it's been an
03:45 - absolute pleasure to work with lenode
03:47 - over the past few years and one last
03:49 - thank you to them for sponsoring this
03:51 - video alright so diving in here to the
03:53 - first category of programming projects
03:55 - we have web applications or websites now
03:58 - these will probably be the most popular
04:00 - and most common type of programming
04:02 - projects just because they are the
04:03 - easiest to deploy to use and to kind of
04:06 - explain and send over to different
04:08 - people they don't actually need to look
04:10 - at any code that only needs to any setup
04:12 - steps they can just go directly to a
04:13 - website and have access to your project
04:15 - now first what I want to do is give you
04:17 - a few examples of different Tech Stacks
04:19 - I might use when I'm building a web
04:21 - application then I'll give you a bunch
04:23 - of different ideas for web apps you
04:24 - could build that are pretty impressive
04:26 - and more unique than your like
04:28 - traditional web applications so the
04:30 - first stack I might recommend using is
04:32 - the mernstack now this is mongodb
04:34 - Express react and node now mongodb is a
04:39 - different type of database it's a nosql
04:41 - database some companies do look for
04:43 - nosql database uses and kind of
04:44 - experience with that so depending on the
04:46 - kind of role that you're applying for
04:47 - you might go towards a stack like that
04:49 - you may also check something out like
04:51 - the mean stack now this is mongodb
04:54 - Express angular and then node you might
04:58 - also do the mevin or mevn stack which is
05:01 - just view instead of angular or react so
05:04 - pick whatever stack you want there but I
05:06 - think mongodb is a good one to use just
05:08 - because it's very simple and you don't
05:09 - have to deal with the whole database
05:10 - setup I'll unless that's something that
05:12 - you maybe want to show off continuing we
05:15 - also have a stack that involves postgres
05:17 - so if you want to use an actual SQL
05:19 - database a lot of companies might be
05:21 - looking for that if you're just applying
05:23 - as like a front-end developer you
05:24 - probably don't need to mess with all
05:25 - that but if you are applying it's more
05:27 - of a full stack or a back-end developer
05:28 - I'd probably recommend going with a SQL
05:30 - database and doing some kind of back end
05:32 - where maybe you have a goaling back end
05:34 - connected to a postgres database and
05:36 - then you have some kind of react front
05:37 - end or whatever front end you want to
05:39 - build lastly you could do a serverless
05:41 - stack whatever kind of serverless
05:43 - functions you want to write is fine I
05:45 - usually use something like Firebase just
05:47 - because that's the simplest especially
05:48 - when it comes to deployment again
05:50 - whatever you want to do here I'm just
05:52 - giving you a few stack examples you can
05:53 - kind of choose which one you'd want to
05:55 - use depending on the kind of role that
05:57 - you're applying for all right so now in
05:59 - terms of a bunch of different ideas for
06:01 - web applications obviously you can just
06:03 - punch in chat GPT give me ideas for web
06:05 - apps but I think some popular ones to do
06:07 - are like social media clones right now
06:10 - this is something that is done by a lot
06:12 - of people but it's pretty complicated
06:14 - not many people can actually make like a
06:16 - decent functioning social media clone so
06:18 - if you can do that that's going to show
06:19 - pretty deep knowledge and I'd say that's
06:22 - a worthy project to have on a resume
06:23 - like a Twitter clone an Instagram clone
06:26 - maybe even something like Snapchat I
06:27 - don't think many people do that maybe
06:29 - you could pick like a more Niche social
06:30 - media and that'd be a more unique
06:32 - project and just to clarify here you
06:34 - don't have to literally build Instagram
06:35 - or Twitter you build a small subset of
06:37 - those features to show that you
06:39 - understand how to interact with
06:40 - databases how to serve maybe live data
06:42 - maybe you're notifying users this would
06:44 - be a big project but again a good one
06:46 - for a resume continuing you might try to
06:48 - do something that is just a component of
06:50 - a social media app like a live feed
06:52 - Believe It or Not implementing a feed
06:55 - can actually be pretty complicated when
06:56 - you're talking about dynamically loading
06:58 - data having like a recommendation engine
07:00 - for showing different pieces of data
07:02 - Maybe showing advertisements so that
07:04 - could be a cool I wouldn't call it a
07:05 - mini project but a different style of
07:07 - project where you just have a live kind
07:09 - of running feed of data and you have
07:11 - different interactions with that data
07:13 - recommendation engine that would be like
07:15 - a cool project to talk about from a more
07:17 - back-end perspective continuing you
07:20 - could maybe make something like a sport
07:21 - bracket generator or like a March
07:23 - Madness bracket uh like website so
07:26 - recently I did like a March mad Madness
07:28 - bracket With My Friends the website was
07:30 - actually fairly straightforward and it
07:32 - just allowed you to input all the teams
07:33 - you thought were gonna win and like
07:35 - match them all up against each other and
07:36 - then as the games were played it would
07:38 - live update on the website and tell you
07:40 - if the team won lost and how many points
07:42 - you got so that's a pretty decent
07:44 - project you could work on you could hook
07:45 - it up to some kind of sports API that
07:47 - gave you like the live data I think
07:49 - that'd be a cool and pretty unique
07:51 - project continuing you could do
07:53 - something like typing racer so I'm sure
07:55 - many of you have seen that website where
07:56 - you're live typing against someone else
07:58 - I actually attempted to build this on a
08:00 - live stream in 12 hours I didn't quite
08:02 - complete the project but the reason I
08:04 - wanted to do this is because it involves
08:06 - using sockets which is live
08:08 - communication that's pretty much real
08:10 - time so you have like a real-time web
08:12 - app which feels a lot different than an
08:13 - app where you have to like refresh the
08:15 - screen you're not getting live data Etc
08:17 - so those are a few ideas there feel free
08:19 - to Branch off of them come up with
08:21 - anything that you want but hopefully
08:22 - that gave you a bit of inspiration for
08:24 - creating a web app alright so my next
08:26 - category here is mobile apps now this
08:29 - could be like a mobile web app so
08:31 - something that just runs in like Safari
08:33 - or runs on a browser in your phone but
08:35 - I'm more thinking of native mobile apps
08:38 - like a Android app or an IOS app or an
08:41 - iPad app or a Mac app or something like
08:43 - that I think that these are pretty cool
08:45 - to build they're pretty unique and a lot
08:47 - of people are building mobile apps at
08:48 - least I'm pretty sure for their resume
08:50 - projects obviously if you're applying as
08:52 - some kind of mobile developer then
08:54 - you're going to want to have this but
08:55 - even if you're applying for a regular
08:57 - Dev job I think it's cool to have a
08:59 - mobile app in your portfolio the reason
09:01 - I like these projects too is because if
09:03 - you can actually get this on say the
09:05 - Google Play Store if you could get it
09:07 - even on test flight if you're talking
09:09 - about the app store or iOS then it's
09:11 - really easy for someone to download and
09:13 - test out and this also shows someone
09:15 - that you've gone through the whole
09:16 - process of packaging an app signing an
09:19 - app bundling it deploying it getting
09:21 - everything into a production ready State
09:22 - and actually you know putting this out
09:24 - into the marketplace which is something
09:26 - that a lot of people don't do so I think
09:28 - it's an interesting talking point in an
09:30 - interview and especially if you can
09:32 - build a mobile app that's useful that's
09:34 - solving some kind of problem it doesn't
09:36 - have to be super complicated as long as
09:38 - it's kind of well polished for it to
09:40 - stand out and be an impressive project
09:42 - to discuss and to look at on a resume so
09:44 - in terms of some ideas here I have kind
09:46 - of General categories like you could do
09:48 - a health app like a calorie tracker a
09:50 - water intake tracker maybe you're going
09:52 - to do something where you're logging all
09:54 - of your workouts I know there's all
09:55 - kinds of apps that exist like that but
09:57 - it's kind of an interesting and simple
09:59 - enough idea to build you could do a
10:01 - recipe app where you're maybe adding
10:03 - different recipes tracking recipes
10:05 - changing them whatever you could do
10:07 - something even simple like a game like
10:09 - you could do a version of Cookie
10:10 - Clickers even the fact that it's just a
10:12 - mobile app that someone can download I
10:14 - don't think the actual app idea itself
10:16 - needs to be crazy as long as it kind of
10:18 - shows that you've gone through this
10:19 - whole process of getting an app into the
10:22 - marketplace which is not trivial to do
10:24 - continuing I had a unique idea this was
10:27 - actually an app that I built back when I
10:29 - was like 16. and this was a textbook
10:32 - page organizer now I know that means
10:34 - nothing to you but essentially when I
10:36 - was like 16 in high school I used to
10:38 - walk uh to school and I had these like
10:40 - really heavy textbooks and I hated
10:42 - carrying my textbooks every day back and
10:44 - forth to school on like a 20 minute walk
10:46 - so what I would do is take photos of the
10:48 - pages that I needed so when I went home
10:50 - I could just load it on my computer and
10:52 - view it where I could load it on my
10:53 - phone and view it and I didn't have to
10:56 - um what do you called bring the bring
10:57 - the textbook with me now what happened
10:59 - was eventually I had so many freaking
11:00 - photos on my phone of all the different
11:02 - textbook pages that I could never find
11:03 - the one that I was looking for so I made
11:05 - a very simple IOS app where what I could
11:07 - do is go in the app upload the photo and
11:10 - then I could like tag it with the page
11:12 - number a little bit of information I
11:13 - could like put put it in a category and
11:15 - now I had an app on my phone that had
11:17 - all the textbook photo pages and I could
11:19 - delete the actual pages from my camera
11:21 - roll to keep the camera roll nice and
11:23 - clean so very simple app idea but it was
11:25 - actually useful and I think I put that
11:27 - on some of my earlier resumes it was a
11:29 - great talking point during the interview
11:31 - so hopefully that gave you a few ideas
11:32 - now the next category alright so next
11:35 - I'm throwing out another project
11:36 - category I don't usually mention but
11:38 - this is internet of things now I like
11:40 - this because again this is kind of
11:42 - unique it's useful it's going to be tied
11:44 - into your life in some way and these
11:46 - automation projects or projects where
11:48 - you're interacting with real world
11:50 - components or sensors are actually
11:52 - really fun and interesting and I like
11:53 - working on them even just as a hobby
11:55 - project so in terms of Internet of
11:57 - Things projects really what this refers
11:58 - to is like interacting with like real
12:01 - world technology or sensors so like
12:03 - interacting with your fridge your
12:05 - microwave or some kind of like motor or
12:07 - camera something that's more than just
12:10 - software right you actually have some
12:11 - Hardware component that you're
12:12 - controlling based on some script API
12:15 - whatever it may be now a few examples
12:17 - here could be something like preheating
12:19 - your coffee maker in the morning so I
12:21 - had a video actually I did on this where
12:23 - I had a little sensor I like uh
12:25 - connected it to my coffee heater and I
12:28 - had it so every time when I woke up at
12:30 - like eight in the morning or something
12:31 - some Loop or some timer went off and it
12:34 - like ran a script that like pressed the
12:35 - button on my coffee maker that started
12:37 - preheating it so when I went downstairs
12:39 - to get a coffee it was already preheated
12:40 - and I didn't have to wait I know first
12:42 - world problems but that's like an
12:44 - interesting idea and something that's
12:45 - relatively simple to build this still
12:47 - kind of looks cool on a resume
12:49 - continuing you could do something like a
12:51 - package detector so maybe you have a
12:53 - little AI script or like a computer
12:55 - vision script you build into a Raspberry
12:57 - Pi you connect the Raspberry Pi to a
12:59 - camera it's kind of at your front door
13:00 - or something and it you know tells you
13:02 - or it gives you a notification on your
13:03 - phone when a package is detected there
13:05 - so you can go and pick it up so the next
13:07 - idea I had here was a Raspberry Pi
13:10 - security system I've talked about this
13:12 - on some other videos because I did try
13:13 - to build this Pro project a while ago
13:15 - but essentially you have a Raspberry Pi
13:16 - you connect a camera to it you have some
13:18 - kind of like motor that controls a lock
13:20 - and then I had the camera sitting at
13:22 - like a door and it was running a facial
13:25 - detection script and if it detected the
13:26 - person's face it would automatically
13:28 - unlock the door if it didn't then it
13:30 - would like run a siren or something that
13:31 - was at least the initial idea I didn't
13:34 - end up finishing that project but a
13:35 - really cool one and again looks really
13:37 - unique and interesting on a resume and
13:39 - you can also talk about it kind of make
13:40 - jokes about it laugh about it Etc which
13:42 - is always nice in an interview setting
13:44 - lastly I had an automatic cat feeder so
13:48 - I actually have automatic cat feeders I
13:50 - have two of them but one of them was not
13:52 - working very well and I was like you
13:53 - know I could probably make this better I
13:54 - could do it so I could just like press a
13:55 - button on my phone I never ended up
13:57 - implementing that idea but I think it
13:59 - would be cool to kind of build like a
14:00 - little Hardware Contraption and have
14:02 - like a very simple software app where
14:03 - you could like press a button you could
14:05 - control the portion you could set like
14:06 - timers for when it was going to go off
14:08 - and I think that would be a cool resume
14:10 - project alright so moving on to my last
14:12 - category here I have to build build
14:14 - libraries software tools or to do open
14:17 - source contributions now I'm leaving
14:19 - this last because I think you should
14:20 - have some other projects on your resume
14:22 - before you add something like this just
14:24 - because it's not visual at all and it's
14:26 - something that you kind of have to look
14:27 - into a bit more to really appreciate
14:29 - however if you're going for a more
14:31 - back-end developer role or something
14:33 - where it's not like super visual or
14:34 - you're not expected to like build
14:36 - front-end applications then this could
14:38 - be really useful so I don't think I need
14:39 - to explain what like a library or a
14:41 - software tool is but in terms of an idea
14:43 - of what you could do I actually built
14:45 - this when I was I don't know it was like
14:47 - 18. and I kept having this issue where I
14:50 - would give people my python games but
14:52 - they couldn't run them because they
14:53 - couldn't get PIP to work on their
14:55 - computer so I built like a little
14:57 - automatic pip installer Library super
14:59 - super simple where essentially you just
15:01 - like imported a package in your python
15:04 - script and it would automatically check
15:06 - if you had pip if you didn't it would
15:08 - download and install pip for you and
15:09 - then it would go and download all of the
15:11 - requirements and install them for the
15:13 - project
15:14 - automatically when you ran the script so
15:17 - that was something that I used to allow
15:18 - like all of my non-technical friends to
15:20 - be able to play my python games I just
15:22 - give them like a little python file I'd
15:24 - say okay download python run python
15:26 - whatever the file name is and then it
15:27 - would just do everything for them so
15:29 - that they didn't have to deal with this
15:30 - whole installation process so hopefully
15:32 - that gives you an idea in terms of like
15:34 - tools or libraries obviously there's a
15:36 - bunch of other stuff you could do there
15:37 - and then open source contributions if
15:39 - there's a cool project you want to work
15:41 - on contribute to it and then mention
15:43 - that on your resume you kind of need to
15:45 - explain it something where you're gonna
15:47 - have to talk about it and what you've
15:48 - done it's not as visual as the other
15:50 - projects but I think it's definitely
15:51 - worth having so with that said I'm gonna
15:53 - wrap up the video here I realized I
15:55 - talked very quickly throughout that
15:57 - video but I just wanted to go as fast as
15:58 - possible give you guys the direct
16:00 - information like I always try to do in
16:01 - these videos and hopefully inspire you
16:03 - and give you a bunch of different ideas
16:04 - so that right now you can go to your
16:06 - editor and start working on some coding
16:08 - projects if you want some more project
16:10 - ideas you can check out my course
16:12 - programmingexpert.io from the link in
16:13 - the description I hope you all enjoyed
16:15 - the video I look forward to seeing you
16:17 - in another one
