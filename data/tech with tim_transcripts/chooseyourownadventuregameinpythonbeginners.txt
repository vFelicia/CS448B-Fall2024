00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:01 - YouTube video so first of all I just
00:03 - like to start off by saying happy
00:05 - holidays to everyone Merry Christmas I
00:07 - hope you guys are enjoying the holidays
00:09 - and you guys are having a good break
00:10 - from whatever it might be they usually
00:12 - do like work or school or whatnot and
00:14 - today I just wanted to show kind of like
00:15 - a beginner level video because I know a
00:17 - lot of you guys are just starting off
00:18 - with Python they're watching my content
00:20 - and I felt find that this might be
00:22 - helpful and obviously it's a lot more
00:24 - fun when you're learning to be able to
00:25 - like make games and apply your knowledge
00:27 - doing something like that rather than
00:29 - like math related programs or whatnot
00:31 - okay so in today's video I'm gonna be
00:33 - showing you how to make you choose your
00:34 - own adventure game now this adventure
00:36 - game the pretty much the way works is
00:38 - we're gonna be asked questions by the
00:39 - console based on your answer you're
00:41 - gonna be let down different paths and
00:43 - based on what path you eventually lead
00:44 - up on you either going to lose the game
00:46 - or you're going to win the game now
00:48 - obviously you can make these as long as
00:50 - you want I've seen people make choose
00:51 - your own adventure games that go for
00:53 - like you could probably play them for
00:54 - like half an hour just keep typing and
00:56 - going and going and going and the way
00:57 - we're gonna do this is just by nesting
00:59 - if statements and health statements and
01:00 - elif's
01:01 - and by using like input and some basic
01:03 - commands in Python that if you guys are
01:05 - familiar with you will already know I'm
01:07 - just gonna be showing you how to kind of
01:08 - apply them quick sidenote as it is
01:11 - Christmas if you guys would like to give
01:13 - a Christmas gift to me just know that I
01:15 - do have a patreon donation link and a
01:17 - PayPal donation link down below you guys
01:19 - enjoy the content and it helps you out
01:22 - please consider donating as you know I
01:24 - don't make that much off of YouTube and
01:25 - it really keeps me motivated to keep
01:28 - pushing out content for you guys that
01:30 - being said if you can't do that that's
01:31 - perfectly fine I would really appreciate
01:33 - your support with either like a
01:35 - subscribe or just by sharing the video
01:37 - so with that let's get started
01:39 - so the first thing I'm going to do is
01:41 - I'm just gonna ask a question and I'm
01:43 - gonna ask the user if they'd like to
01:45 - play the game typically the first thing
01:46 - we do so we're just gonna say oh would
01:48 - you like to play and then what I do is I
01:52 - usually just put the answer I'm
01:54 - expecting in brackets so they know what
01:56 - to type okay so we've got that
01:58 - so we'll say if answer dot lower dot
02:03 - strip equals equals yes then in here we
02:06 - can start playing the game and otherwise
02:08 - so if they type anything other than yes
02:10 - we'll just print
02:12 - that's too bad not mad but right so what
02:19 - this is doing right here is pretty much
02:21 - just checking what this answer is we
02:23 - have don't lower they're just gonna
02:24 - convert whatever the user types into all
02:26 - lower cases and this is going to strip
02:27 - any white spaces from it so if you had
02:29 - like two spaces then you typed yes it'll
02:31 - just strip that off so that we can
02:33 - compare it directly to the string yes
02:34 - and see if they typed like any variation
02:37 - of yes okay so the my game I hadn't
02:41 - really thought about what I'm gonna do
02:42 - for this I'm thinking maybe something
02:43 - like you're being chased and you have to
02:46 - choose like if you're going left or
02:48 - right or if you go down the forest or if
02:50 - you go down the sidewalk I don't know
02:52 - like some random thing it's prolly gonna
02:53 - make no sense but obviously modify this
02:55 - game to be whatever you want I'm sure
02:57 - you guys are a lot more creative than I
02:58 - am and I'm just gonna make it kind of
02:59 - short so that you can see the flow and
03:02 - how it works so what I'm gonna do is ask
03:04 - another questions I'm gonna say answer
03:06 - equals input I'm going to say you what
03:11 - do you call it reach a crossroads would
03:17 - you like to go left or right just a very
03:20 - basic okay or right and then if the user
03:24 - types left we'll go one way if they tape
03:26 - right we'll go the other way and if they
03:28 - type like nothing else then what we'll
03:31 - do is we'll just tell them like they
03:32 - lost like they went down a path that was
03:34 - not acceptable okay just say if answer
03:37 - equals equals left and again we're
03:40 - probably gonna want one adult lower and
03:41 - don't strip this and we can actually do
03:44 - this just by putting it right outside
03:46 - the input this will just save us from
03:48 - having to do it each time we check so
03:50 - we'll just type this once so don't strip
03:52 - answer it you can start left and we'll
03:54 - say L if answer equals equals right and
03:58 - then we'll do a last else statement here
04:01 - and here we'll say print invalid choice
04:06 - and I will just tell the user they lost
04:10 - or not they lost you lost like that
04:14 - right so if they go right then we're
04:16 - gonna take them down a different path
04:17 - and if we go our cert and if we go left
04:19 - or an taking down different paths now if
04:21 - they go left what I'm gonna ask them to
04:24 - do is I'm going to say like you
04:25 - encounter
04:25 - do you want to attack it you want to run
04:27 - away so my god okay just a classic
04:29 - example so say answer equals input and
04:35 - you guys can make these like really long
04:36 - look I'm just doing this very simple I'm
04:38 - sure I already said this but what did we
04:40 - say here we'll say you encounter a
04:43 - monster would you like to run or attack
04:51 - and then in here what we can do and I
04:54 - think you guys are probably getting the
04:55 - idea of how this works now is it check
04:57 - answer again and we'll say if answer
04:59 - equals equals attack then what we'll do
05:03 - is we'll print that was not the greatest
05:07 - idea because you probably don't want to
05:09 - talk a monster that was not the greatest
05:15 - idea and then we will simply say you
05:18 - lost and obviously you probably wanna
05:23 - make this story a lot more detailed and
05:25 - more fun because right now this is kind
05:26 - of a very simple game
05:28 - we'll say else or actually L if answer
05:32 - equals equals run actually you know what
05:36 - let's just do LS because as I tape
05:37 - anything other than attack then we'll
05:39 - just tell them like you got away and
05:40 - then you can keep going so we'll say
05:42 - okay so we'll say print good choice you
05:48 - made it away safely okay awesome and we
05:53 - can ask another question down here which
05:55 - we'll do in just one second okay so
05:56 - let's go back here now in case you guys
05:58 - getting a little bit confused cuz we are
06:00 - working with a bit more code now
06:02 - essentially what's happening here is
06:03 - we're first asking question right if
06:05 - they want to play they say yes we're
06:07 - gonna come in here and we're gonna
06:08 - actually start our game in this game our
06:10 - game right now is what I have
06:11 - highlighted so what you do after you ask
06:14 - the question so you reach crossroads
06:16 - would you like to go left or right is
06:17 - obviously returning it into lower case
06:19 - we're stripping the spaces and we're
06:20 - checking their answer because this is in
06:22 - the same indentation level as when we
06:25 - ask the answer so we check if they say
06:27 - left we check hmm yeah we check if they
06:30 - say right sorry I was kind of getting
06:31 - confused there and then if they say
06:33 - anything else we just tell them they
06:34 - have an invalid choice now based on if
06:37 - they choose left or if they choose right
06:38 - they're gonna be prompt
06:39 - with different questions in this case if
06:41 - they choose left they're gonna say that
06:43 - they encounter a monster would you like
06:45 - to run our attack and then we can go
06:46 - into this part of the story as well as
06:48 - this part of the game if they had the
06:50 - answer right well we don't know we want
06:51 - to do yet but we're gonna put something
06:53 - in here so if they answer right we can
06:55 - say like I don't know what's a good
06:58 - thing to say I'm just gonna tell them
07:00 - they lost here because I don't want to
07:01 - create too many kind of paths but what
07:03 - do you typically do is you create
07:04 - another kind of section like this in
07:06 - here and you have like a ton of
07:07 - different paths and eventually and this
07:10 - is what makes a game more difficult if
07:11 - you have like a ton of different paths
07:12 - and only one of them is correct then you
07:14 - could be going down like a really long
07:16 - path just to find out that you could
07:17 - have never won on that path and that all
07:19 - of the possible like ways to get off or
07:22 - decisions you could have made will lead
07:23 - to you to lose and in earlier decisions
07:26 - you had to make like a correct one okay
07:28 - so in here I'm just gonna say print you
07:32 - walk aimlessly is that how you spell
07:37 - that word maybe to be you write and fall
07:44 - on a patch of ice why not you injure
07:51 - your leg and let's say cannot continue
07:57 - game over
07:59 - okay there you go is that inter tell you
08:04 - spell injure maybe okay anyways alright
08:07 - so let's just test this out right now
08:08 - before I go any further and make sure
08:10 - everything is working so it says what do
08:11 - you like to play I'm gonna type yes and
08:13 - it says you reach crossroads would you
08:15 - like to go left or right so let's see
08:16 - what happens if I go right if I go right
08:18 - says you walk aimlessly to the right and
08:20 - fall in a patch of ice you injure your
08:21 - like and cannot continue game over and
08:23 - there you go so you can see to how that
08:24 - cannot work so if we run it again then
08:26 - we'll type yes again Oh since I have
08:29 - this slash we got out of that so you
08:32 - have a shoe type yes correctly okay you
08:34 - reach crossroads would you like to go
08:35 - left to right
08:35 - so let's go up left now if we go left
08:38 - says you encounter monster would you
08:39 - like to run or attack so if we run away
08:41 - it says good choice you made away safely
08:43 - and then this is where we're gonna
08:44 - continue our game so I hope you guys can
08:46 - see how this is working okay so in here
08:48 - blast one more questions I think I might
08:50 - wrap up the game because thank you guys
08:51 - are getting an idea of how exactly
08:53 - to do this so we'll say answer equals
08:55 - input and we'll say hmm
09:01 - you see I ate let's see here a car and a
09:09 - hmm coin let's see here which would you
09:13 - like to take and we'll give them the
09:20 - options here which I know I haven't been
09:22 - doing but we'll add this in now and then
09:24 - again we can check one more time we'll
09:26 - save answer equals equals plane we'll do
09:30 - something here else if they type
09:32 - anything else still a car or any any
09:34 - other word then we'll do what's in the
09:35 - else so the type plane will say print
09:40 - unfortunately wow that was really messed
09:43 - up spelling unfortunately you do not
09:46 - know how to fly plane and therefore game
09:49 - is over we'll do that or someone K you
09:51 - do don't know how to fly dot dot dot and
09:56 - then we can just say game over otherwise
10:00 - we'll say print and I don't really know
10:03 - what the objective of this game was but
10:04 - we can just say you won something like
10:06 - that okay so you know obviously see this
10:07 - game makes like really no sense there's
10:09 - no story line to it it's not the point
10:10 - of the tutorial tutorial is to show you
10:12 - how we can kind of nest stuff like this
10:14 - so yeah hopefully this gives you an idea
10:17 - of how you can kind of make your own
10:19 - choose your own adventure game obviously
10:21 - you would want to keep going creating
10:22 - more paths and it makes a good game if
10:26 - you make some paths where you don't lose
10:28 - on one of the decisions so for example
10:30 - one we're going right or going left we
10:34 - don't lose on like both of those paths
10:36 - so right we'll give us a new path and
10:37 - this way it makes it more interesting it
10:39 - makes it more depth of the game and
10:40 - obviously you can play it a lot more
10:42 - times so anyways I think I'm gonna wrap
10:45 - up the video here that's been it for
10:47 - coding a choose your own adventure game
10:49 - in Python and actually one last thing
10:51 - I'll just show you in case any of your
10:53 - still around here is if you want to make
10:54 - this gameplay on repeat so you never
10:56 - break it and you're gonna keep playing
10:57 - you put while true like this and then
11:01 - you tab all of this in I don't know why
11:04 - that's not tabbing okay and then
11:06 - inside of the else statement you say
11:08 - break like this what'll happen is this
11:11 - will continuously run until they
11:14 - eventually type anything other than yes
11:16 - to play again and if they don't type yes
11:19 - it will break out and it will end the
11:20 - game okay so that's when at 4 choose
11:23 - your own adventure game in Python if you
11:25 - guys enjoyed please make sure you leave
11:26 - a like and subscribe to the channel and
11:29 - I will see you again in future videos
