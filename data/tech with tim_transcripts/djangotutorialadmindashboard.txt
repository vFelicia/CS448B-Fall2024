00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:01 - django tutorial now today's video is
00:03 - gonna be a bit shorter and i'm going to
00:05 - be doing is showing you guys how to use
00:06 - the Django admin dashboard this relates
00:09 - directly to databases and how you can
00:11 - see all of your different tables and
00:13 - entries and all of that I'm gonna be
00:15 - quickly showing you a few more things
00:17 - you can do with databases in terms of
00:18 - how to delete stuff and how to get like
00:21 - lists of entries so for example say you
00:23 - wanted to sort all of the entries or say
00:25 - you wanted to get all of the entries
00:27 - that started with a certain letter or
00:28 - something I'll show you how to do that
00:29 - this is known as querying and there's a
00:32 - ton of different commands for querying
00:33 - so I'm not gonna be showing you all of
00:35 - them but I'm sure you guys can look them
00:37 - up or we'll probably be using them
00:38 - throughout the series so you will learn
00:40 - them now I'm in my main directory right
00:42 - now by my site directory the first thing
00:44 - I'm gonna do is just quickly extend what
00:46 - I did in the last video and show you how
00:48 - you can get a list of different entries
00:50 - and add more than one because this will
00:52 - be good when we go in the admin
00:53 - dashboard to see more than one entry so
00:56 - I'm just gonna do Python manage PI and
00:59 - then shell and what I'm gonna do in here
01:01 - is again import what he called our
01:04 - models so from main up models imports
01:08 - and then here we'll do item and we'll do
01:10 - two to do list like that and now what
01:16 - we're gonna do is I'm gonna get all of
01:18 - the items in to do list and show you how
01:21 - we can kind of search for certain items
01:23 - so I'm just gonna say T equals to-do
01:27 - list objects dot all like that or
01:31 - actually let's just do dot objects so
01:33 - now we don't have to keep typing that we
01:34 - can just type T when we want it say for
01:36 - example get all of the objects we can
01:37 - just do t dot all like that and then we
01:41 - get a query set that gives us all the
01:43 - objects but let's say we want to search
01:46 - for an object and before we knew how to
01:47 - get one using like the ID equal to one
01:50 - but what if we want to get all of the
01:51 - objects in our set that start with the
01:53 - letter T or that start with Tim or
01:55 - something like that well there's a way
01:57 - to do that and it's known as filtering
01:59 - so if we want to filter our query set
02:02 - and get all of the objects or all of the
02:05 - data that fits a specific criteria we
02:10 - can say t dot filter and then we can
02:11 - name the criteria so in
02:13 - this case I could say name and then I
02:16 - believe you can just do under underscore
02:17 - starts with equals and in this case Tim
02:21 - so there's a ton it like there's a ton
02:24 - of these double underscore things that
02:26 - you can use I don't know all of them
02:27 - you'd have to look them up to get them
02:29 - all but if I do this and I hit enter you
02:31 - can see that we get the same set because
02:34 - obviously this starts with Tim now if I
02:36 - do this again and I say like maybe Bob
02:38 - you see we get an empty query set and
02:40 - this is a way that you can check if a
02:42 - specific element you're looking for is
02:44 - in the set rather than trying to get it
02:47 - and raising an exception so for example
02:49 - if I want to get something that has ID
02:51 - equal to two and I filter that rather
02:54 - than getting an error we just get an
02:55 - empty query set because none of the IDs
02:57 - are equal to two right so that's how we
02:59 - can kind of check if what we're looking
03:03 - for actually exists in the database so
03:05 - that's how you get stuff now to delete
03:07 - stuff is pretty straightforward you just
03:09 - have to actually get that database
03:11 - object first so I'm gonna say del
03:14 - underscore object is equal to and in
03:17 - this case we'll say t get ID equals one
03:21 - now if I want to delete this very simple
03:24 - we'll just do del underscore object dot
03:26 - delete like that and if you hit enter we
03:30 - will delete this object so now if I type
03:33 - T again sorry T dot all you can see that
03:37 - we have an empty query set because we've
03:38 - obviously deleted the to do list that
03:40 - we've added so let's just create two
03:42 - more to do list really simply and we'll
03:44 - just say T or T 1 equals to do list like
03:50 - this I will just say name equals first
03:55 - list and then we'll do T 1 dot save and
03:59 - then we'll do the same thing here with
04:01 - witty codes T 2 and we'll just call it
04:04 - second list just so this way when I
04:06 - start doing the admin dashboard stuff
04:07 - which will be in one second then we'll
04:10 - be able to see more than one entry so
04:12 - we'll say second list and then T 2 dot
04:17 - say if like so won't bother any adding
04:19 - any items so that's actually it if you
04:21 - need to get out of this you can just
04:22 - type quit like that and there we go
04:24 - alright so now we've added some things
04:26 - into our
04:26 - database so let's go to our admin
04:29 - dashboard now so how do we do that well
04:31 - our first step to accessing the admin
04:33 - dashboard is to create a login account
04:36 - so right now if we actually run our
04:37 - server and we say python managed up i
04:40 - run server server will start running we
04:44 - can copy this domain here and we can go
04:48 - to it now remember we actually have this
04:50 - directory or link which is slash admin
04:53 - and when I do this it actually brings me
04:55 - to this Django admin dashboard
04:57 - the thing is though what username and
04:59 - what password should we use well we
05:01 - don't have any so we need to actually
05:03 - create one so I'm going to stop running
05:05 - this for a second
05:06 - and what I'm gonna do is create a login
05:09 - so I'm gonna say Python manage dot PI
05:11 - and then I believe it is create super
05:15 - user yadus so there we go create super
05:18 - user and then in this case what we'll do
05:20 - is just give a username email and
05:22 - password so I'm gonna put Tim as my
05:24 - username I'll say Tim at Tech with Tim
05:28 - dotnet and then for a password
05:30 - illustrate one two three four four now
05:32 - all right
05:33 - password is too short okay okay so I'll
05:35 - just use another password then what is
05:39 - it what is it saying here bypass
05:41 - password okay so it just said that's
05:43 - fine I can use that as a password
05:44 - anyways let's now try to sign in to our
05:48 - admin dashboard actually see what we're
05:49 - getting so let's say Tim and my password
05:51 - and click login and you oh well it would
05:55 - help if I ran the server my apologies on
05:58 - that let's run that and now let's
06:00 - refresh this continue and there we go
06:03 - we are now inside of our a band
06:05 - dashboard now we have these groups in
06:08 - this users database which is actually
06:10 - storing if I go to users and the users
06:13 - that we just created so Tim for example
06:15 - right and that's one database that's
06:17 - their same for groups this this is a bit
06:19 - different we don't need anything for
06:21 - that now the thing is where's our other
06:22 - database we created that database and
06:25 - we've been using it that has our to-do
06:26 - list in it well we actually need to give
06:29 - the dashboard kind of access to that
06:31 - database this is really easy to do but
06:34 - I'm just gonna open up my sub line text
06:35 - again here and what we need to do to do
06:38 - this is go to
06:40 - when you call it our I believe it is
06:42 - admin dot PI inside of what he call it
06:46 - the main application folder here all
06:49 - right so we just have to start start by
06:51 - importing our models so from models
06:54 - import and in this case we can just
06:56 - import the model that we care about in
06:58 - this case which is to do lists because
07:00 - items are gonna be stored within a to-do
07:01 - list and then we just do admin dot site
07:05 - dot register and then in this case we do
07:08 - to do list which means that now we will
07:12 - actually be able to see the to-do list
07:14 - on our admin site so that's that's all
07:16 - we have to do for that so now this
07:18 - should actually automatically have
07:20 - updated but it may not have yeah it did
07:23 - not so let's just rerun our server
07:25 - quickly Oh
07:26 - everyone says reloading ok so now this
07:28 - should hopefully be updated if i refresh
07:30 - this work work work I guess not
07:34 - ok so let's just try this again slash
07:39 - admin ok so there we go sorry I've just
07:42 - I've been messed around so now I'm back
07:44 - slash admin and now you can see that
07:47 - under main which is our application main
07:48 - we have the database and model to-do
07:50 - list so if I open this you can see that
07:53 - we have first list and second list now
07:55 - this is a quick way as well if you want
07:57 - to change elements or delete stuff you
07:59 - can go in here and obviously you can
08:01 - just click delete or you could save
08:02 - stuff you can see the history of it and
08:05 - all that kind of stuff so that's kind of
08:07 - how the admin dashboard works in terms
08:09 - of viewing your databases I figured I
08:12 - would just quickly show this to you guys
08:13 - because it's a really useful tool to
08:14 - make sure that what you're doing is
08:16 - actually working properly but remember
08:18 - if you create a new application or
08:19 - you're creating a new model you have to
08:21 - actually add that and register it from
08:23 - within your app and up I file inside of
08:26 - your application so if I wanted to add
08:27 - the items for example then I would have
08:30 - to do item the item model and I don't
08:33 - have to import item so let's just try
08:34 - that quickly and make sure I think's
08:35 - working with that wait for this to
08:38 - refresh here if I do this let's go fresh
08:43 - alright maybe we'll just end it and then
08:45 - reload oh and alright it says it
08:48 - reloaded so let's try this i go here and
08:50 - i refresh this now you can see we have
08:52 - items and
08:53 - I go to items obviously there's nothing
08:54 - because we don't have any items so
08:56 - anyways that's been the admin dashboard
08:58 - in the next video we're gonna go into
09:00 - templates which will be a much longer
09:01 - video on dynamically showing these kind
09:04 - of this information on our website
