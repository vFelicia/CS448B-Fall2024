00:00 - so the next thing you want to avoid if
00:01 - you want to become a faster programmer
00:03 - is restructuring and redesigning your
00:05 - code constantly now what I mean by that
00:07 - is you go in you just start coding a
00:08 - project you don't really think about
00:09 - what you're going to do and then halfway
00:11 - in the middle of your project while
00:12 - you're coding you're like damn I want to
00:15 - add this in I want to have this feature
00:16 - I want to create this new thing but the
00:18 - way that you've designed this so far
00:19 - does not allow for that to happen and
00:21 - now you have to redesign the entire
00:23 - document the entire code base to add
00:25 - this one feature to add something new
00:27 - before you start writing any code for
00:29 - somewhat of a large project or even a
00:31 - medium-sized project you should really
00:32 - plan out exactly what you're going to
00:34 - need what data structures you're going
00:36 - to need what kind of classes the
00:37 - interaction between objects and other
00:39 - data and pieces of information
