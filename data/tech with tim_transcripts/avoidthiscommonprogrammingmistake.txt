00:00 - for me personally if you were to give me
00:01 - a list of a bunch of functions or
00:03 - classes or kind of some detailed
00:05 - requirements right you gave me what
00:07 - exactly I needed to do I could complete
00:09 - those tasks pretty quickly and I would
00:11 - just continue going through them and
00:12 - spend the entire time pretty much
00:13 - writing code however if you don't give
00:16 - me that and instead you give me kind of
00:17 - a very very large task that's not broken
00:19 - down that requires a ton of thinking up
00:22 - front Etc that's going to take me a lot
00:24 - longer to complete but a lot of people
00:26 - especially as they kind of get into the
00:28 - intermediate and advanced stage of
00:29 - programming they forget that thinking
00:31 - about your code and designing your code
00:33 - is a completely separate thing from
00:35 - actually writing the code itself if
00:37 - you're constantly switching between
00:38 - these activities spending a few minutes
00:40 - writing a few minutes thinking a few
00:41 - minutes writing a few minutes thinking
00:43 - you're going to notice that you're
00:44 - extremely delayed you're not very
00:46 - efficient and you're constantly context
00:48 - switching and it's hard to kind of get
00:49 - into the Flow State and really get a lot
