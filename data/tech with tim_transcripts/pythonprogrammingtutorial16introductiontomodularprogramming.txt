00:00 - hey guys welcome back this is the 16th
00:03 - video in my Python programming series
00:05 - and today we're going to be talking
00:06 - about Python modules and import
00:09 - statements so this is something new that
00:11 - I haven't talked about yet but Python is
00:13 - a modular programming language meaning
00:16 - that we can use multiple files together
00:18 - to create one program and you'll
00:20 - understand what I mean later in the
00:21 - video when I show some examples but yeah
00:24 - so pretty much in Python at the
00:26 - beginning of all your Python scripts
00:27 - what you typically do is you write
00:29 - something like this it says import and
00:32 - you can see this highlights in orange
00:33 - yellow meaning that it is a key word in
00:35 - Python now there are many built-in
00:38 - modules or what they called in Python
00:41 - that contain a list of functions and
00:43 - classes that we can use in our Python
00:46 - script so for example the math module
00:48 - import math this allows me to do things
00:51 - like dot square root or the square root
00:55 - function which I believe is like this
00:58 - and then you can put something inside of
01:01 - it so yeah there's plenty of cool things
01:04 - like that there's another module it's
01:05 - called PI game we're going to be doing
01:07 - this later I'm going to be talking about
01:09 - game development with Python if you want
01:11 - to see that leave a comment down below
01:13 - and I'll get it started soon then we
01:15 - have import we could also import
01:17 - something called OS and this gives us
01:20 - opportunity to do things like file paths
01:23 - and lots of different things like that
01:24 - we can import images we can import tons
01:26 - of different things into our files in
01:29 - Python so we're just going to use the
01:32 - math module today for demonstration
01:34 - purposes but pretty much what happens is
01:37 - there's a bunch of built in modules in
01:39 - Python so this one is known as a
01:40 - built-in module math when you download
01:43 - and install Python it pretty much you
01:46 - download that module the PI game module
01:48 - that I was talking about is not a
01:50 - built-in module that means you actually
01:52 - have to go to the Internet you have to
01:53 - find it and install it on your computer
01:55 - before you can import it into your
01:57 - Python program and now what's really
02:00 - cool about Python is that it's an open
02:01 - source language meaning that you can
02:04 - actually create your own modules and
02:06 - they contain functions classes and you
02:09 - can use them in many of your different
02:11 - programs or you can also send the
02:13 - to a friend maybe or post them online
02:14 - for other people to be able to use so
02:17 - let's get right into it and let's do
02:20 - some things here so if we want to use
02:22 - this math module we have to first start
02:25 - by typing math so the name of our module
02:28 - here okay so math and then afterwards
02:31 - we're going to do the name of a function
02:33 - or a class in that that math module so
02:37 - you see a bunch of things pop up there
02:39 - in the little box so if I do the dot
02:41 - again and wait a second it should pop up
02:42 - yeah so there we go and you see we have
02:44 - cosine sine tangent all that stuff
02:48 - degrees factorial all these things
02:52 - inside of our math module so these are
02:55 - new things that we wouldn't be able to
02:57 - use before so I'll show you if we do
02:59 - math dot pi and I print that to the
03:01 - screen well we should get an endless
03:02 - number of digits like this math dog pi
03:08 - so running there we go so I just had to
03:10 - print a bunch of numbers so math dot pi
03:12 - day didn't print all of the mind can
03:13 - only want to ten decimal points so yeah
03:17 - and then I'll show you if I comment out
03:18 - this this import math what will happen
03:22 - if I try to do this we get an error
03:25 - because well math is not defined we
03:27 - didn't import it at the top of our
03:29 - program so we'll uncomment this now now
03:32 - I can do things like math dot degrees
03:35 - degrees simply turn something that is in
03:37 - radians into degrees so if I did math
03:41 - dot Pi in here for example and we print
03:43 - that to the screen we get 180 degrees
03:46 - like that they also have the math dot
03:49 - radians I believe which does the
03:51 - opposite so it turns a degree into a
03:55 - Radian so if we did 60 degrees here I've
03:59 - got and we get one point zero four or
04:03 - seven which is about PI over 3 radians
04:06 - like that so yeah there are lots of cool
04:08 - things that we can do with these modules
04:10 - now I'll actually show you an example of
04:12 - how we can use our own modules and how
04:14 - we can import our own modules into our
04:16 - function so I'm going to just start by
04:18 - typing import I'm going to type my
04:21 - module just like this okay now I haven't
04:25 - actually created this module yet we're
04:26 - going to do that
04:27 - just a second now I'm going to go and
04:29 - I'm going to find the directory that my
04:30 - main script is in so it's in tutorials
04:32 - up here I've got this open and remember
04:35 - how we had the file in here as well
04:37 - because it has to be in the same
04:38 - directory so I'm going to create a new
04:40 - file in that directory so file new file
04:43 - I'm going to save this one as my module
04:48 - now spelling is very important again
04:49 - capitals do matter and it has to be in
04:52 - the same directory as our main script
04:55 - which it is like that now inside of this
04:58 - module I'm going to write a very basic
05:00 - function if you haven't seen that video
05:02 - yet go check that out first we just
05:04 - talked about some basic functions and
05:06 - what they do and the use of them so I'm
05:08 - going to define I'm just going to call
05:09 - it my func like this it's going to take
05:12 - a parameter called X and all it's going
05:15 - to do is return X plus 5 so very basic
05:20 - function like that but just for
05:22 - demonstration purposes here okay and now
05:24 - I have my module imported like this so I
05:27 - can actually use my module so I'm going
05:29 - to do print my module dot myfunc because
05:35 - that's the name of my function and then
05:38 - inside I need to give it a number so
05:39 - what number do we want to use maybe
05:40 - we'll use 6 when we print this out and
05:44 - you see we get 11 so by simply all I did
05:48 - was create a new file put it inside of
05:50 - my same directory as this script here
05:54 - and easy enough we were able to use it
05:57 - now I can actually create multiple
05:58 - functions in here so I can create define
06:01 - another funky the name this one will
06:05 - take X again an inside here I'm going to
06:07 - return X integer division five and then
06:12 - again we could use that one so instead
06:14 - of my func we'll use another function
06:16 - let's just type in a big number like
06:19 - that and see what we get there we go so
06:23 - again it's working perfectly fine so
06:26 - that's how modular programming is what
06:29 - it's called works in Python now
06:31 - obviously if you're going to be doing
06:32 - modular programming it's usually for
06:35 - larger programs and bigger programs
06:38 - where you want multiple files to keep
06:39 - things organized say
06:41 - maybe if you're doing a flight simulator
06:42 - you may have one module that includes
06:45 - all of your physics functions so you
06:47 - know that when you need to do physics
06:50 - you're going to import your physics
06:51 - function and then you can or a module
06:53 - sorry and then you can use the functions
06:55 - from there and the great thing about
06:57 - this is that these are these modules are
07:00 - reusable in other Python files I can
07:02 - import them and I can reuse these
07:04 - functions I don't have to constantly
07:06 - rewrite them inside of my script like
07:09 - this so this has been a very basic
07:11 - tutorial just an introduction to modular
07:14 - programming I showed the math module a
07:16 - little bit if you want to learn about
07:17 - some of the built in sorry modules in
07:21 - Python then just go ahead and go to
07:23 - their website and you can see a bunch of
07:25 - the different ones that they have
07:26 - another one that we may be using later
07:27 - is called OS so the statement for that
07:30 - is just import OS and if you want to get
07:32 - started with game development you can
07:34 - look into PI game which is this cool
07:37 - thing that I'm going to be doing a
07:38 - tutorial series on later so yeah that's
07:41 - been the video for today we talked a
07:42 - little bit about modular programming if
07:44 - you enjoyed please like and subscribe
07:47 - and I will see you again tomorrow with
07:49 - more content
