00:00 - oftentimes in python you want to embed
00:01 - expressions objects variables whatever
00:04 - inside of a string now if you're using a
00:06 - version of python that is at 3.6 or
00:08 - above then you can use something known
00:10 - as an f-string an f-string is simply a
00:11 - lowercase or uppercase f followed by a
00:13 - string either single double or triple
00:15 - quotation marks and then what you can
00:17 - put inside of here is hello my name is
00:19 - and if you want to embed any expressions
00:21 - you do them in curly braces let's say
00:23 - name is equal to tim let's just go ahead
00:26 - and put name inside of here and now this
00:28 - will be evaluated as a string so if i go
00:30 - here and i decide to print out the f
00:32 - string like this you will see that all
00:35 - is good now of course we can put numbers
00:37 - and expressions in here as well so i can
00:38 - do something like two plus three this is
00:40 - completely valid notice that works fine
00:42 - i can also have multiple things so i can
00:44 - do that and then put my name and again
00:46 - this works the lowercase or uppercase f
00:48 - you just need to be using a python
00:50 - version that is at 3.6 or above
00:52 - hopefully you found this helpful if you
00:53 - did follow for more
