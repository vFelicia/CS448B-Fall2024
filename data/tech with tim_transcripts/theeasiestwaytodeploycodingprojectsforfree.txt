00:00 - if you've ever struggled with deploying
00:01 - or sharing your applications I'm here to
00:03 - tell you that you are not alone and this
00:06 - video is for you I know firstand how
00:08 - frustrating it is when you spend so much
00:10 - time working on an app and all you want
00:12 - to do is quickly share that with someone
00:14 - demo it maybe send it to a teammate or
00:16 - another Dev to test out and you realize
00:19 - that in order for you to do that they're
00:20 - either going to have to set it up on
00:22 - their computer which is an absolute
00:23 - nightmare especially if they're not
00:24 - technical or you're going to have to go
00:26 - through a whole deployment process set
00:28 - it up on some kind of URL and go through
00:30 - these tedious steps that you shouldn't
00:32 - have to do now in this video I'm going
00:34 - to Showcase a new platform to you called
00:36 - Acorn which completely changes how all
00:38 - of that is done it makes it extremely
00:40 - simple to not only share your
00:42 - applications but have them deployed in a
00:44 - test environment or a production
00:46 - environment if you eventually get to
00:47 - that stage let's have a quick look here
00:49 - and I'll show you exactly how you can
00:51 - deploy and share your applications as
00:53 - fast as possible so this platform is
00:55 - called Acorn and I've teamed up with
00:57 - them for this video now first of all
00:59 - they're completely free you do not need
01:01 - to pay to use this you just need a
01:03 - GitHub account to get started now the
01:05 - way it works is that you can create
01:06 - something known as an acorn image now
01:08 - this image is essentially the deployment
01:10 - instructions and this can contain
01:12 - containerized applications serverless
01:15 - functions databases really any type of
01:17 - resources that you want the idea is you
01:19 - make a simple Acorn file this will
01:22 - accompany a Docker file in your
01:24 - application and you can simply push an
01:26 - image to some kind of registry and then
01:28 - other people are able to access that
01:29 - image and deploy the app with literally
01:31 - one click you'll see what I mean and I
01:33 - can show you a quick demo here so at the
01:35 - bottom of acorn's website there's a few
01:37 - apps that they have already Acorn IED or
01:39 - whatever they want to call it they've
01:40 - created an acorn essentially for this
01:42 - app so for example Minecraft server
01:44 - click one button and you have a
01:45 - Minecraft server deployed we also have
01:47 - this massive deck Dex one sorry so I'll
01:49 - click on this just going to click launch
01:51 - it'll bring me to this page here that
01:53 - specifies the acorn image which is on
01:55 - this registry and then I can just click
01:57 - on deploy now what this will do is
01:59 - deploy a separate seate instance of this
02:01 - into my Acorn account and give me my own
02:03 - environment where I can mess around with
02:05 - this app that means I can view the logs
02:08 - I can view debugging information there's
02:10 - a lot of devops tools and stuff that are
02:12 - ins the side of acorn and I can mess
02:14 - with this test it and do whatever I want
02:16 - and this won't affect the original owner
02:18 - or whatever production version of this
02:20 - is deployed so that means you can send
02:22 - this to someone who's not Technical and
02:24 - if they break it or they do something
02:25 - you told them not to do doesn't matter
02:28 - that's just affecting their deployment
02:29 - in their own Acorn account so for
02:32 - example this is deployed already I can
02:34 - click on this link and it brings me to a
02:36 - fully deployed version of this game this
02:38 - is its own separate instance which is
02:40 - just running in my Acorn account now I
02:42 - could send you this link and you can
02:43 - mess with it if you want and I can
02:45 - deploy as many versions of this as I
02:47 - want literally with one click like you
02:49 - just saw so with all that said let me
02:51 - show you how we actually make an acorn
02:53 - now there's a bunch of different ways to
02:54 - do this but once I create an acorn
02:56 - account so just go to the link in the
02:58 - description you can just log in you're
02:59 - going to sign in with your GitHub
03:00 - account what you'll be brought to is a
03:02 - page that kind of looks like this now
03:04 - what I can do is deploy a new Acorn by
03:06 - clicking on deploy and I can do this
03:08 - from an existing image or from a catalog
03:10 - so if I already know the image just put
03:12 - in the image and I can actually deploy
03:13 - this right here in the cloud and I also
03:16 - have a Sandbox environment that I could
03:17 - go into so I can go to playground here
03:20 - and I can mess around and actually
03:21 - create my own Acorn file here if I just
03:24 - want to test something directly in my
03:25 - browser now for many of you you're
03:27 - probably going to want to do this from
03:29 - your ID e and you're going to want to
03:30 - take an existing application and make an
03:32 - acorn for it so that you can deploy it
03:34 - so that's the steps that I'm going to
03:36 - show you obviously there's a ton of
03:37 - great documentation and you can have a
03:39 - look at all of that from the link in the
03:40 - description but let's head over to our
03:42 - IDE here and I'll show you that I have
03:44 - an app right here I'll quickly run it so
03:46 - you get an idea of what it is and then
03:48 - I'll show you how we would make an acorn
03:50 - for it and start sharing this with
03:51 - anyone so I just used Acorn to run this
03:53 - app in development mode but what I'll do
03:55 - is open up the URL here that it created
03:57 - for me and we can quickly have a look at
03:59 - the app so this is a simple application
04:01 - that I actually built to kind of demo
04:03 - flask log in and log out this was in a
04:05 - tutorial a while ago but I can go ahead
04:07 - and create an account so just make an
04:09 - account set a password okay and then it
04:13 - brings me to this page where I can just
04:14 - make some notes so I can say something
04:16 - like Hello World now this app uses a
04:18 - postris database it's got some flask
04:20 - dependencies it's doing some password
04:22 - hashing and stuff and if I wanted to
04:24 - instruct someone how to set this up on
04:25 - their local computer it'd be a little
04:28 - bit of a pain and there'd be many steps
04:29 - where they could go wrong on and not
04:31 - actually get this deployed app so what I
04:33 - can do here is just quickly show you the
04:35 - general steps you'd follow if you wanted
04:37 - to make this into an acorn that could be
04:39 - deployed by anyone so you can see I'm in
04:41 - an acorn file and the first thing we
04:43 - would do if we're working in vs code is
04:44 - we just go here and we'd install the
04:47 - acorn extension this will just give us a
04:49 - few commands that we can run and some
04:50 - syntax highlighting for our file then we
04:53 - would create a Docker file now the
04:55 - docker file is just like any normal
04:57 - Docker file kind of describes how we're
04:59 - actually going to run the container that
05:00 - would run this application so I specify
05:03 - my python version working directory I'm
05:05 - going to install the requirements copy
05:07 - the necessary files set some environment
05:09 - variables Etc many of you have probably
05:11 - used Docker before and you've seen
05:12 - something like this in the past now that
05:15 - we have the docker file created we'd be
05:16 - able to make a Docker image and we could
05:18 - run this using Docker but that doesn't
05:20 - help us with the deployment and
05:22 - connecting things like datab bases and
05:24 - other instances that we need so what we
05:26 - do is we go and we create an acorn file
05:28 - now in the acorn file we can specify a
05:30 - bunch of different services that we need
05:32 - in this case I'm specifying that we need
05:34 - to use postris so I put the image for
05:36 - using postris this comes directly from
05:38 - Acorn iio now of course they've got a
05:40 - bunch of other services as well think of
05:42 - mongod DB Maria DB whatever you want
05:45 - they pretty much have that and then we
05:46 - specify the containers so the container
05:48 - we'll have is app the context is just
05:51 - the local directory here we're going to
05:53 - be on 8,000 HTTP we're going to use
05:55 - postris some information about Dev and
05:57 - then we can specify some environment VAR
05:59 - which are going to utilize some of the
06:01 - information from our postris database so
06:04 - we have the address the database name
06:06 - the username the password and these
06:08 - environment variables I can access in my
06:10 - python code so I go here to my what is
06:14 - this a nitpy file and you can see that
06:16 - I'm using all of these environment
06:18 - variables to set up the connection to my
06:20 - remote postris database obviously a
06:22 - million other options that you could
06:24 - specify here I'm just showing you a
06:25 - really really quick demo of how you
06:27 - would do this for a flask applic
06:30 - which I'm sure many of you are familiar
06:31 - with so once we've set up this Docker
06:33 - file and this Acorn file what we'll need
06:35 - to do is just download the acorn CLI and
06:38 - then we can build an image from this
06:40 - Acorn file and we can go ahead and
06:42 - upload that and then allow anyone to use
06:44 - and share it so to install the CLI I
06:47 - have some instructions here it's going
06:48 - to differ depending on your operating
06:50 - system on Mac and Linux you can use Brew
06:53 - uh you can also use Curl to do this and
06:54 - on Windows you can use something called
06:56 - scoop now scoop is a command line
06:58 - installer from Powershell so if you just
07:01 - type scoop Windows install here in the
07:05 - browser you can pop it up and you can
07:07 - download this so you can actually just
07:09 - run through these commands sorry in
07:11 - Powershell so just open up Powershell
07:14 - and then you can simply type in those
07:15 - two commands and then scoop should be
07:17 - enabled once you have scoop enabled you
07:19 - can then use that to actually install
07:20 - the CLI so you simply do scoop install
07:23 - Acorn once you've got that now you're
07:26 - good to actually start using the acorn
07:27 - CLI so the first thing you're going to
07:29 - do is just log in so type Acorn log in
07:32 - it's going to bring you to the browser
07:34 - where you're going to be prompted to log
07:35 - in you can see I'm actually already
07:37 - logged in so I don't need to do anything
07:39 - here it should just Auto log you in if
07:41 - you're logged in on the web so now that
07:42 - we've logged into Acorn we can start
07:44 - using some of the commands to run acorn
07:46 - images but if we want to actually create
07:48 - our own image we need to deploy that to
07:50 - some type of registry so we also just
07:52 - need to log in with that registry so it
07:54 - could be something like Docker Hub or we
07:56 - could use the GitHub registry so if I
07:58 - pop up the document dou umentation here
08:00 - you can see that to log into dockerhub
08:01 - we'll have this command and to log into
08:04 - the GitHub container registry it'll be
08:06 - this one so obviously you need account
08:07 - on one of these two sites I have one on
08:09 - Docker Hub so what I can do is just copy
08:12 - this paste it in here and then I can go
08:14 - through the instructions and log into
08:15 - dockerhub now I've already done that so
08:17 - I'm not going to run this command but
08:19 - once we've done that we're good to start
08:20 - running the commands to actually
08:22 - building this Acorn image and then
08:24 - sharing it with whoever we want I've
08:25 - just zoomed in here to make it a bit
08:26 - easier to read but what we'll do is
08:28 - we'll go into the root where our Acorn
08:30 - file is so I'm in that directory the
08:32 - flask web app tutorial and I'll simply
08:35 - type Acorn build- T and then I'm going
08:38 - to specify the prefix which is equal to
08:41 - the registry that I want to upload this
08:43 - to so I believe this is Docker actually
08:46 - it's index. docker.io slash that I'm
08:50 - going to put my dockerhub username which
08:52 - is Tech with Tim zero and then I'm going
08:54 - to put whatever I want to call this so
08:56 - I'll just call this flask web tutorial
08:59 - like that and go ahead and hit enter now
09:02 - this is going to start building an acorn
09:04 - image for me using the files that I have
09:06 - here so the acorn file Docker file Etc
09:09 - it's actually already finished now that
09:11 - it's done what I can do is push this to
09:13 - a registry and then I can start using it
09:15 - I can also run it locally which I'll
09:16 - show you in a second so I'm going to say
09:18 - Acorn push and then I'm simply just
09:21 - going to take the name that I had so
09:22 - actually we can go back to this command
09:25 - and change this to be Acorn push and if
09:28 - you've ever used docker for you'll
09:29 - notice these commands are super familiar
09:31 - right it's pretty much the same thing
09:32 - you just use aord as a prefix so I'm
09:34 - going to go ahead and push that image
09:37 - we'll give that a second here to upload
09:40 - and once that is pushed to the registry
09:42 - we'll be able to actually deploy a
09:43 - version of it using Acorn all right so
09:45 - this has been pushed so now what I'm
09:47 - going to do is just copy this URL I'm
09:49 - going to go over to the acorn website
09:52 - I've got like a million tabs open here
09:54 - so let's go over to
09:56 - Acorn okay we're going to go to our name
10:00 - we're going to go to Shared acorns and
10:02 - then what I can do is simply paste in
10:04 - the acorn image like this and I can
10:06 - create a button for this that I could
10:08 - embed on a website I could create a QR
10:10 - code or I can just click the link so if
10:12 - I go ahead and click the link here it
10:14 - will bring me to this where I can now
10:16 - deploy version so I'm going to click on
10:18 - deploy and by the way this will work for
10:19 - anyone not just the person who created
10:21 - that image so flask web app is being
10:24 - created it's going to provision the
10:26 - postris server do everything that we
10:28 - need and then once it's finished we can
10:29 - click this link and we'll have the app
10:31 - running all right so there we go I just
10:33 - cleaned up some of the other acorns and
10:34 - this is now running and we can go to the
10:36 - URL and we can see that we have our
10:38 - running application now what's
10:40 - interesting is if I go here to my shared
10:43 - acorns we can actually see stats on how
10:45 - many times these acord have been
10:47 - deployed per day per week per month per
10:49 - year Etc so you can see some kind of
10:51 - basic analytics about them and how many
10:53 - people are actually using the images
10:55 - that you've built now what I'll do is
10:56 - I'll actually leave a link in the
10:58 - description and you can click it and it
11:00 - will just deploy this Acorn and you guys
11:01 - can mess around with it in your own
11:03 - local environment now last few things to
11:06 - show you here are that we do actually
11:07 - have some tools specifically for
11:09 - developers so let's say there's some
11:11 - Acorn image that you guys actually want
11:13 - to mess with locally or maybe you want
11:15 - to run some kind of deployment but you
11:17 - want to be able to debug that and
11:19 - interact with it from your local machine
11:21 - well we can actually use something
11:22 - called Dev mode so what I did previously
11:25 - is I took that Acorn image and I pushed
11:27 - that to a registry we don't need to do
11:29 - that we could instead just from our
11:31 - local um kind of CLI here type Acorn Dev
11:35 - and then dot this just means use the
11:37 - local um kind of acorn file that's in
11:39 - the current directory and when we do
11:41 - that it will just start running exactly
11:43 - like it was before but with our local
11:45 - machine so it's still going to give us
11:47 - kind of a production endpoint or a
11:49 - deployment endpoint that we can utilize
11:51 - but we'll be able to see all of the logs
11:52 - here and sync any changes that we make
11:55 - with the application so you can see that
11:57 - this is actually now running an endpoint
11:58 - point that I can connect to which will
12:00 - load the application for me so you can
12:02 - see it's loaded up here and I'll be able
12:04 - to view any logs of my application just
12:07 - like I would if I was running this
12:08 - locally here in my CLI now there is
12:11 - potentially some additional
12:12 - configuration you'll need to do when
12:13 - you're running this in Dev mode
12:15 - especially for environment variables and
12:17 - some other stuff like that but generally
12:19 - speaking this is a way that you can
12:20 - debug the application mess with it and
12:22 - actually hot reload the deployed website
12:25 - from your local computer I'll let you
12:27 - guys mess with that more but there is
12:28 - something called Dev mode definitely
12:30 - check it out so now that we've gone
12:31 - through all of that the last thing I'll
12:33 - mention is that if you do want to move
12:34 - into a production environment you can do
12:36 - that with Acorn you may have noticed
12:38 - that some of the apps that we have
12:40 - deployed right now kind of have a time
12:42 - limit right like 2 hours 8 hours
12:44 - whatever the time limit is that's
12:46 - because these are just meant for testing
12:47 - iterating and sharing your applications
12:50 - not to be a persistent um production
12:52 - environment however with Acorn you can
12:55 - do that right now you can actually
12:56 - request to get beta access completely
12:59 - for free to a pro account well you'll
13:01 - have the ability to host applications
13:02 - persistently for free so make sure you
13:05 - do that from the link in the description
13:06 - if you actually want to have a
13:08 - production environment but for many of
13:10 - you this is just the easiest way to
13:11 - share your apps and let people use it in
13:13 - their own isolated environment super
13:16 - happy to be teaming up with Acorn for
13:18 - this video thank you guys for showing me
13:20 - this awesome technology and letting me
13:21 - share it with all of you if you enjoyed
13:23 - the video make sure to leave a like
13:25 - subscribe to the channel and I will see
13:26 - you in the next one
