00:00 - Python is one of the world's most
00:01 - popular and fastest-growing programming
00:04 - languages
00:05 - it's an officially recognized language
00:06 - by companies like Google and other large
00:08 - tech companies and it's well on its way
00:10 - to becoming one of the world's most
00:12 - popular programming languages now in
00:14 - this video I'm gonna discuss the pros
00:16 - and cons of Python and what's holding it
00:18 - back from becoming one of the best
00:20 - languages that we've ever seen so let's
00:22 - go ahead and get started
00:23 - starting with the pros of the Python
00:24 - language now probably one of the biggest
00:26 - advantages Python has compared to any
00:28 - other programming language is how usable
00:31 - it is now this language is by far in my
00:34 - opinion one of the easiest programming
00:35 - languages to learn and it's capable of
00:37 - doing very powerful things that you
00:39 - wouldn't expect something so easy to
00:41 - learn would be able to do now some
00:43 - people may classify this as a
00:44 - disadvantage which we'll talk about
00:45 - later but this is one of the reasons the
00:47 - language has been skyrocketing in
00:48 - popularity recently it really makes the
00:51 - developers lives easier and it's one of
00:53 - the reasons that a lot of people get
00:54 - into programming nowadays because there
00:56 - are languages like Python that are much
00:58 - easier to use they don't have to deal
01:00 - with the complicated lower end code and
01:02 - memory references and all of that and
01:04 - they can go straight into building you
01:05 - know nice web applications and gooeys
01:08 - and complicated things that maybe
01:10 - something like scratch or a very
01:12 - beginner kind of programming language or
01:14 - builder might not be able to do and this
01:17 - actually leads me nicely into the
01:18 - sponsor of today's video which is
01:20 - hosting girth if you're a developer like
01:21 - me it's extremely important that you
01:23 - have a website where you can show off
01:24 - your projects and attract potential
01:26 - clients or employers fortunately for us
01:28 - they're companies like host hangar that
01:30 - offer extremely fast and affordable web
01:32 - hosting setting up my hosting your
01:34 - website took just a few clicks meaning
01:36 - my website was up and running in just
01:38 - minutes one of my complaints with other
01:40 - web hosting companies was the lack of
01:42 - customized ability and the ability to
01:44 - change the code hosting her however
01:46 - allows you to change virtually
01:47 - everything in the admin page you can
01:49 - view your servers database SSH info and
01:52 - even deploy projects directly from
01:53 - github repositories this means you can
01:56 - use your server for more than just a
01:57 - website go to hosting your column slash
01:59 - tech with Tim to start building your own
02:01 - website for just a few dollars a month
02:03 - another massive advantage of Python is
02:05 - the amount of resources that exist
02:07 - online for it now typically you're gonna
02:10 - have tons of resources for every
02:11 - programming language that
02:12 - you use but python has an extreme amount
02:15 - available for free on the internet this
02:18 - essentially means that when you're
02:19 - developing something if you want to
02:21 - create some specific application you
02:22 - need a specific piece of code you want
02:24 - to do something chances are you're going
02:26 - to be able to find it online and it's
02:28 - probably going to be a high value
02:30 - resource now this is great and it's
02:32 - assumed for most popular languages but I
02:34 - have to mention it because there's a lot
02:36 - of languages and especially older ones
02:37 - that don't have great resources out
02:39 - there and especially if you're a
02:41 - beginner you may struggle to kind of
02:42 - pick up the language and figure out how
02:44 - to use it if you're using a outdated
02:46 - material or you just don't have the best
02:48 - resources available to you now this
02:50 - leads me kind of into the next point
02:52 - which goes with I guess resources which
02:53 - is the amount of modules and packages
02:56 - that python has this has to be one of
02:58 - the languages top pros in comparison to
03:01 - any other language in that whatever you
03:03 - want to do you probably already have a
03:04 - foundation built for you and all you
03:06 - have to do is import that package now
03:08 - Python makes it extremely easy to first
03:11 - of all install and second of all import
03:13 - packages which in other languages and I
03:15 - can tell you when I've worked with some
03:16 - Android development with Java is just an
03:18 - absolute nightmare to do so this means
03:21 - if you're trying to create a website
03:22 - trying to create a game or a GUI you can
03:24 - probably do it in Python without having
03:26 - to know all of the specifics of that
03:28 - kind of app because you can just bring
03:30 - in a package like Pi game or Django that
03:33 - has a framework and has something built
03:34 - for you already and all you have to do
03:36 - to is learn how to use that and
03:37 - typically these modules in the popular
03:39 - ones have lots of tutorials online
03:41 - probably from me or they have some great
03:44 - documentation that you can read to
03:45 - figure out how to use that now I've
03:47 - mentioned web development so I'm gonna
03:49 - go on a little kind of strain here about
03:50 - why Python is so great for web
03:53 - development and this again is one of the
03:54 - pros of the language it actually has a
03:56 - very good asynchronous programming
03:58 - interface so it's just called like the
04:00 - async IO module or the async module
04:02 - which makes it really awesome for
04:05 - creating all kinds of web services and
04:07 - websites now obviously there's popular
04:09 - frameworks out there for Python like
04:11 - Jango and flask and companies like
04:13 - Instagram and tinder actually built
04:14 - their original applications using Jango
04:17 - I'm not sure if they still are built off
04:19 - that now but I know originally they were
04:20 - built using that and creating web
04:22 - services and REST API use
04:24 - - is actually extremely easy and a lot
04:27 - of people prefer doing in this language
04:29 - because it's fairly easy to maintain
04:30 - based on the readability and it's just
04:32 - really really easy to do and we keep
04:35 - coming back to this is how easy Python
04:37 - makes things compared to other languages
04:39 - again one of the reasons why it's so
04:41 - popular in a massive Pro of the language
04:43 - you can just get things done quickly and
04:45 - easily and if you're a beginner chances
04:47 - are you can find some resources that are
04:49 - gonna help you out now into my next
04:51 - point here which is another massive Pro
04:53 - a Python is going to be machine learning
04:56 - and artificial intelligence now there's
04:58 - nothing really out there other than
04:59 - maybe R if you use that a lot the kind
05:02 - of rivals Python it when it comes to
05:04 - machine learning in AI and the reason
05:05 - for that is well the amount of modules
05:07 - that exist for the Python language not
05:10 - only is it dynamic which just makes
05:11 - things much faster to kind of type out
05:13 - and get things done in and the
05:14 - readability is really great when you're
05:16 - creating machine learning apps because
05:17 - it's just fast easy to fix easy to get
05:20 - things done and create kind of prototype
05:21 - models but with these modules like numpy
05:24 - and tensorflow and Chara's and all of
05:27 - these awesome libraries you don't really
05:29 - have to know that much about machine
05:30 - learning to actually create applications
05:32 - and start messing around with it and you
05:33 - know I've done a ton of machine learning
05:35 - and AI I'm 19 I don't know that much
05:37 - about math I'm not that good at it and I
05:39 - can do that in Python because of the
05:41 - amount of resources that exist now my
05:43 - last kind of pro for the Python language
05:45 - and that isn't as big as the other ones
05:47 - that I mentioned is that it's becoming
05:48 - available on more and more different
05:50 - devices
05:51 - now what I mean by this really is kind
05:53 - of the Raspberry Pi as we start to see
05:55 - these kind of smaller computers that run
05:57 - Python on them this is a really exciting
05:59 - and massive advantage for the language
06:01 - because it opens up the possibilities
06:03 - for what you can do being able to have a
06:05 - tiny little portable board that can run
06:07 - your Python code on it is huge and it's
06:09 - awesome when you're trying to create
06:10 - like robots and just different kind of
06:12 - cool fun things where you can just use
06:15 - these little micro processors a little
06:17 - micro boards to run your Python code so
06:19 - I figured I'd throw it in here it's not
06:20 - a massive advantage of the language but
06:23 - I think as we kind of go through the
06:24 - years we're gonna see that Python is on
06:26 - more and more devices and when you can
06:28 - run them on the really small boards like
06:29 - that it really just expands the horizons
06:31 - for what's possible and makes the
06:33 - language even more versatile than it
06:35 - already is
06:36 - and now time for the cons of Python now
06:38 - I want to quickly mention that Python is
06:40 - personally my favorite programming
06:42 - language now that's just so when you
06:44 - guys are listening to this you can
06:45 - possibly pick out any bias I might have
06:47 - but also I want you to realize that I'm
06:49 - really not just trying to bring the
06:51 - language down I love the language it's a
06:53 - great language it's personally my
06:54 - favorite and everything I say here is
06:56 - meant to be objective and it's something
06:58 - that you need to realize if you're a
06:59 - Python developer because there's just
07:01 - times when pythons really isn't the best
07:03 - language and if you're just trying to
07:05 - fight someone on why the language is so
07:06 - much better you know you should really
07:08 - consider these things because in many
07:09 - applications as languages that are gonna
07:11 - be better than Python for those specific
07:14 - applications now the first major con
07:16 - that most people are aware of with
07:18 - Python is that it's a very slow language
07:20 - now when I say slow I don't mean like oh
07:22 - your code takes ten seconds to run I
07:24 - mean that in general when you're trying
07:27 - to do something very quickly python is
07:29 - not gonna be your best option now
07:30 - there's a variety of different reasons
07:32 - for that I won't go into it exactly but
07:34 - just languages like C++ C maybe
07:36 - lower-level languages are gonna be much
07:39 - faster than Python typically and when
07:41 - you have algorithms that need to run
07:43 - quickly maybe you're doing sorting or
07:45 - searching or maybe you're just doing
07:46 - something on an integrated piece of
07:48 - hardware that needs to meet a specific
07:49 - speed requirement you're probably not
07:52 - gonna use Python and to really break it
07:54 - down simply for you guys if you're
07:55 - looking at some low-level code written
07:57 - and see compared to your higher-level
07:58 - Python code and you're running an
08:00 - advanced algorithm that you know needs
08:02 - to do something very quickly chances are
08:04 - and I'd be willing to bet you the C code
08:05 - is going to run that faster now this
08:07 - brings me into my next point which is
08:09 - python is really bad for game
08:11 - development and 3d rendering now one of
08:14 - the reasons is bad for 3d rendering is
08:15 - because 3d rendering is extremely
08:18 - computationally heavy you might see or
08:20 - you might hear when you're running it on
08:21 - your computer and the fans are just
08:22 - going crazy so when you have a slower
08:24 - language trying to do 3d rendering is
08:26 - more difficult and I'm sure there's some
08:28 - other reasons why it's more difficult
08:29 - than maybe I'm not as educated on that
08:31 - some people could leave in the comments
08:32 - down below but this also means that game
08:34 - development is gonna be much more
08:36 - difficult with Python you know you can't
08:37 - use something like unity with Python
08:39 - which is what very popular game
08:41 - development engine and really doing
08:43 - anything more than 2d games is just it's
08:46 - not gonna get done in Python it's not
08:47 - gonna be as good as you want it to
08:49 - and this now leads into the next point
08:51 - which is Python sucks on mobile and I
08:54 - almost just want to say Python doesn't
08:56 - exist on mobile I know that's wrong but
08:58 - really trying to create Python
09:00 - applications for mobile phones like
09:01 - iPhone or Android is really difficult
09:04 - and it's just such a pain I would almost
09:06 - be willing to say it's probably easier
09:08 - for you just to learn a language like I
09:09 - think it's called Kotlin or Java and
09:11 - just learn how to do Android development
09:14 - rather than try to figure out how to do
09:15 - with Python because yeah you can use
09:17 - modules like Kibby but when it actually
09:19 - comes to deploying these apps out and
09:21 - using them usually they suck and usually
09:24 - it just it's not great when you're
09:25 - trying to update them and there's just
09:26 - so many issues with it and we're really
09:28 - not there yet when it comes to Python on
09:30 - mobile apps so that's a major
09:31 - disadvantage as well if you're thinking
09:33 - about becoming a mobile app developer I
09:35 - don't know I wouldn't recommend Python
09:37 - to be the language that you learned now
09:39 - the next major disadvantage here is
09:40 - going to be the global interpreter lock
09:42 - now essentially what this is is you
09:44 - can't run more than one thread at the
09:47 - same time in the same Python interpreter
09:49 - now I'm not gonna go into detail and
09:51 - talk about exactly how this works but
09:52 - which what this means is that
09:54 - multi-processing in python is much more
09:56 - difficult now if you know what
09:57 - multi-processing is like you guys will
09:59 - understand why you can't do this with
10:01 - the global interpreter lock so I'll
10:02 - leave it at that but it's something to
10:04 - consider if you're trying to create and
10:05 - kind of parallelism in your Python
10:07 - application it is possible you can do it
10:09 - but it's much more difficult and it's
10:11 - much more of a pain more things to learn
10:13 - and kind of more things to deal with in
10:15 - the language and my last con of Python
10:17 - here and this is kind of opinionated
10:19 - because it's not necessarily factual is
10:21 - that for large projects python is not
10:24 - always the best choice now even if you
10:27 - can create everything with Python you
10:28 - know Python supports whatever you're
10:30 - trying to do some people will prefer to
10:32 - use a more structured language maybe
10:34 - like Java or C++
10:37 - when creating out larger applications
10:39 - because of the amount of structure that
10:40 - it imposes on your programmers now this
10:43 - is just something I've read a lot and
10:44 - I've heard from a lot of people in the
10:46 - industry is that Python allows you to
10:48 - almost do too much it's almost too
10:50 - flexible and when you're creating really
10:53 - large robust applications and you have a
10:56 - ton of different people working on it
10:57 - you almost want to make sure that
10:59 - specific people can't do these kind of
11:01 - weird
11:02 - a key things that you can do in Python
11:03 - and mess up your codebase if that makes
11:06 - sense you want clean readable code you
11:09 - want everything to be nice and
11:10 - structured you want interfaces you want
11:11 - inheritance you want classes all of this
11:13 - and with Python all of this is possible
11:16 - but it's just sometimes it's easy to get
11:18 - carried away and do things the pythonic
11:20 - way rather than do them the more
11:21 - maintainable and sustainable way so
11:23 - that's something I figured I'd mention
11:25 - here just because some people do mention
11:26 - that and you know it's something to look
11:28 - into more if you're really thinking
11:29 - about that specific kana the language
11:31 - when working on a very large project now
11:34 - I know a lot of you guys are programmers
11:35 - and I'm sure you have a ton of different
11:37 - projects you've worked on probably using
11:39 - the Python language I just want to give
11:41 - you a reminder that if you want to show
11:43 - off those projects and really get
11:44 - yourself out there on the Internet to
11:46 - take advantage of that discount that I
11:48 - have in the link in the description from
11:49 - our sponsor hosting er really guys go
11:52 - out there get yourself a website have a
11:54 - place to present your information it
11:56 - just makes yourself look so much more
11:57 - professional when you're applying for
11:59 - jobs and when you're showing your
12:00 - projects off rather than linking the
12:02 - github and linking some different social
12:04 - medias so anyways that has kind of been
12:06 - the video on the pros and cons of Python
12:09 - I just want to make it clear that again
12:10 - some of this has been my opinion so you
12:13 - know take it with a grain of salt but
12:14 - Python is great for so many different
12:16 - things and there's a reason that's
12:17 - becoming one of the most popular
12:19 - programming languages in the world now
12:21 - this being said it does have a bunch of
12:23 - disadvantages and please don't fall into
12:25 - the trap where you love the language so
12:26 - much that you neglect those
12:28 - disadvantages and don't advance your
12:30 - skills and learn other languages that
12:31 - you know can be better in specific areas
12:33 - so anyways that has been it I hope you
12:36 - guys enjoyed if you did as always leave
12:38 - a like on the video and subscribe to the
12:40 - channel for more content I will see you
12:41 - guys in another video
