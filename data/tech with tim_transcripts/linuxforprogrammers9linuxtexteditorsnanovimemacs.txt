00:00 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:01 - video in this linux for programmers
00:03 - tutorial series
00:04 - in this video we're going to be talking
00:06 - about some common linux text editors
00:08 - and just giving a really quick guide on
00:10 - how to actually use them
00:11 - now the two editors in particular i'm
00:13 - going to be talking about are nano and
00:15 - vim
00:15 - these come by default with your linux
00:17 - distribution or with ubuntu if you're
00:19 - using this distribution
00:20 - then i will very quickly at the end of
00:22 - the video show you emacs in case you
00:24 - care to use that one
00:25 - i want to preface this by saying this is
00:27 - not going to be a ton of depth or detail
00:29 - on these editors
00:30 - there is a lot to learn about these and
00:31 - literally hundreds of shortcuts that you
00:34 - could know or that you could use
00:35 - so i'm just going to give you kind of
00:37 - the basics and enough to get by
00:39 - in these editors anyways let's dive in
00:41 - after a quick word from lenode which is
00:43 - a sponsor of this video
00:44 - and this series lenote is one of the
00:46 - best platforms to use when hosting a
00:48 - service
00:49 - app domain anything in the cloud
00:51 - anything that runs on linux it will run
00:54 - on lenode lenode is really a great
00:56 - platform for developers they have a ton
00:58 - of integration with popular databases
01:00 - with kubernetes with docker
01:02 - and there's a ton of other things that
01:03 - you're going to be using quite commonly
01:04 - as a developer
01:05 - so that said get 100 in free credit
01:07 - towards lenode by clicking the link in
01:09 - the description and signing up with a
01:11 - new account
01:12 - another reminder to make sure that
01:13 - you're signed up for the last five
01:14 - videos in this series
01:16 - there will be another link in the
01:17 - description you can sign up on this
01:18 - platform register with your name and
01:20 - your email and you will get notified
01:22 - when these videos are up and you will
01:23 - have access to them before everybody
01:25 - else so that said
01:26 - let's dive in
01:30 - [Music]
01:36 - so the first editor i'm going to show
01:37 - you how to use is personally my favorite
01:39 - in my
01:40 - preference when i'm using a linux
01:41 - machine and that's simply because this
01:43 - one is just
01:43 - really simple it's super easy and a lot
01:45 - of times all i need to do is copy or
01:47 - paste something or just write a few
01:49 - lines
01:50 - and i find nano is the easiest to do
01:51 - that in anyways
01:53 - to access nana you simply type nano
01:55 - we've seen this a few times before
01:56 - you also can type the file name
01:58 - afterwards so if the file currently
02:00 - exists so let's just say you know
02:01 - test.txt
02:03 - if this file currently existed in the
02:05 - directory that we were in
02:06 - then it would open this file if this
02:08 - file didn't exist then it would create
02:10 - this file so if i say nano test.txt
02:13 - we don't have a test.txt it's actually
02:15 - creating this file for us
02:17 - so now what i can do is i can start
02:18 - writing some stuff in this file so as
02:20 - you've seen we can just kind of type
02:22 - we navigate using the arrow keys here
02:24 - and then a bunch of the common commands
02:25 - for nano are listed down below
02:27 - so the ones that you really need to know
02:29 - first of all is paste cut and copy
02:31 - as well as write out and save so if you
02:34 - hit control s
02:35 - this will save the current file but if
02:38 - you want to save
02:39 - as so you want to save this as a
02:40 - different file name then you would do
02:42 - control
02:43 - o so whenever you see this little hat
02:45 - this usually just represents
02:46 - control so i'm going to say control o
02:48 - and now notice it's going to ask me
02:50 - what file name that i want to write this
02:52 - out to so you can think of control o
02:55 - or write out as kind of like a save as
02:57 - so here what i could do is you know
02:59 - change the file name or change the
03:00 - extension
03:01 - extension and then write it out of
03:02 - course if i want to cancel i can do
03:04 - control c now to look at all of the
03:06 - options and all the keyboard shortcuts
03:08 - you can do control
03:09 - g and when you do this you can see that
03:12 - there is a ton of things and again you
03:13 - got to navigate here with the arrow keys
03:15 - to go through this
03:16 - but you can display the help text close
03:17 - the current buffer or exit from nano
03:19 - that's control x
03:21 - write the current buffer when it says
03:22 - buffer it just means whatever is in the
03:24 - file here
03:24 - i insert another file into the current
03:26 - buffer there's a ton of stuff that you
03:28 - can do
03:29 - and again i don't really want to go
03:30 - through a ton of this stuff but this is
03:32 - kind of the basics now i'm going to show
03:34 - you how you can actually copy and paste
03:36 - text because this is probably the most
03:37 - common thing you're going to do if
03:39 - you're using an editor like nano
03:40 - so to copy something in nano you
03:43 - actually have to figure out how to
03:44 - select it now this is in my opinion
03:46 - harder to do it not very intuitive
03:48 - whatsoever but to select some text that
03:51 - you would like to copy
03:52 - you're going to use your cursor as well
03:54 - as a keyboard shortcut
03:55 - so what you need to do is you need to
03:56 - mark a position this is where you're
03:58 - going to start copying from
04:00 - and then you will use the cursor to
04:02 - highlight an amount of text so to mark
04:04 - the position
04:05 - you're going to use the uh the following
04:07 - shortcuts so control
04:08 - and then the hat or control and the
04:11 - number six
04:12 - now notice that there's a little hacked
04:13 - where 6 is if you were to press shift
04:15 - that's what it is in nano it will say
04:17 - control plus hat
04:19 - but anyways you get the idea so control
04:21 - plus 6 or control plus hat
04:23 - then after that you can use your cursor
04:25 - to select text so you can see that this
04:27 - is
04:27 - kind of highlighting and what will
04:29 - happen is that when you decide to cut or
04:31 - copy or do whatever you're doing with
04:33 - the selected portion
04:34 - it's going to go up to and not including
04:37 - the cursor so right now this will
04:39 - include
04:39 - the entire string hello but if i move my
04:42 - cursor over the o
04:43 - it's only going to include the first
04:45 - four letters same thing here if i
04:47 - did it here would only include the first
04:49 - three letters so just make sure your
04:50 - cursor is placed after
04:52 - what you want to select or what you want
04:54 - to copy
04:55 - because obviously that's just how it
04:56 - works so now when you want to copy
04:58 - something and also notice down here it's
05:00 - saying
05:00 - mark set so we're marking a portion when
05:03 - you want to actually copy something you
05:04 - use the following command
05:06 - it's actually alt and then 6 again or
05:09 - alt and then hat now it's not going to
05:11 - do anything other than remove the
05:13 - current mark when you do that
05:14 - but this will now be copied to your
05:16 - clipboard at least in nano
05:18 - so now if i want to paste this text i
05:20 - can do control and then u
05:22 - and it's going to paste it out and of
05:23 - course i can paste it as many times as i
05:26 - want
05:26 - now there's a ton of other shortcuts as
05:28 - well again i'm not going to go through
05:29 - all of them but another common one is
05:30 - the cut command
05:31 - so if you wanted to cut some text out in
05:33 - fact let's just cut these three hellos
05:35 - right here
05:36 - you're going to place your mark so
05:37 - you're going to do control and then
05:39 - six or control and then hat you're going
05:41 - to select what it is that you want
05:43 - so so let's select all this and then
05:45 - you're going to do control
05:46 - k so ctrl k and notice that cuts all of
05:49 - the text i can move down here
05:51 - and then i can paste all of that in with
05:53 - ctrl u
05:54 - so that is cut copy and paste on how you
05:57 - write
05:57 - out and save a file now of course
06:00 - there's some more things but that's kind
06:01 - of all i want to show you for nano just
06:03 - really wanted to give you the
06:04 - fundamentals so you understand how it
06:05 - works
06:06 - now to exit from nano you can first save
06:08 - so ctrl
06:09 - s or write out and then do control x so
06:12 - control x will bring you out here
06:14 - and now we'll start talking about bim
06:15 - now before we continue i need to quickly
06:17 - thank the other sponsor of this video
06:19 - which is algo
06:20 - expert algo expert is one of the best
06:22 - platforms to use when preparing for your
06:23 - software engineering coding interviews
06:25 - and i happen to be an instructor on the
06:27 - algo expert platform
06:28 - at this point in time i've created over
06:30 - 15 coding interview questions on
06:32 - algo expert if you want to check them
06:33 - out you should go to the link in the
06:35 - description
06:35 - and use the code tech with tim for a
06:37 - discount on the platform
06:39 - so to access vim on your computer what
06:41 - you're going to type is
06:42 - vi or on your linux machine sorry vi
06:45 - stands for vim works very similarly to
06:47 - nano
06:48 - if you want to open vim and create a new
06:50 - file with a certain name
06:51 - you would say vim and then let's just do
06:54 - test2.txt
06:56 - and now this is opening a new file or
06:58 - creating a new file called test2.txt
07:00 - and you can start writing stuff in it
07:02 - now the most confusing thing about vim
07:04 - is that right now i actually can't type
07:06 - anything in this file i'm in this file
07:08 - right
07:09 - and if i actually start just mashing
07:10 - keys on my keyboard nothing's happening
07:13 - why isn't anything happening well vim is
07:16 - something that a lot of people really
07:17 - like and something that a lot of people
07:19 - really hate i'm kind of somewhere in
07:21 - between i'm not a huge vim fan but i
07:23 - don't mind it
07:24 - anyways vim has two modes so vim has an
07:27 - insert mode and it has a command mode so
07:30 - when you're in
07:31 - insert mode you can actually modify the
07:33 - file right
07:34 - and when you're in command mode you're
07:35 - typing specific commands that will
07:38 - they could modify the file as well but
07:40 - they're not you're not
07:41 - writing them into the file directly
07:43 - you'll see what i mean in a second but
07:44 - anyways to get into
07:45 - insert mode in vim you type i so notice
07:49 - when i hit
07:49 - i on my keyboard it says insert at the
07:52 - bottom of my screen
07:53 - now to get from insert mode back to
07:55 - command mode you hit
07:56 - escape so now i'm back in command mode
07:58 - and if i start typing well you know
08:00 - nothing's showing up but if i go i i'm
08:02 - back in insert mode
08:03 - and now you see i can start typing stuff
08:05 - in this file
08:06 - now there is a ton of stuff to go
08:08 - through with vim more than nano
08:10 - so again we're not going to go through
08:11 - all of it but i'll just talk about some
08:13 - basic things
08:14 - so first of all let me show you how to
08:15 - quit vim because this is the most
08:16 - frustrating thing ever they do not make
08:18 - it very easy or intuitive whatsoever
08:20 - you need to go into command mode so if
08:22 - you want to escape this you you hit
08:24 - escape
08:24 - and then what you do to quit is the
08:26 - following if you would like to save your
08:28 - changes
08:29 - and quit you type colon notice that's
08:31 - showing up at the bottom of my screen
08:33 - then w q and then you hit enter
08:36 - now what this will do is save the
08:38 - current file and quit so if i hit
08:40 - this it's going to save test2 now if i
08:42 - open this back up
08:43 - hello is still in here so now we are
08:45 - currently in command mode that's the
08:46 - default mode you go into
08:48 - if i want to quit but i do not want to
08:50 - save then what i do is colon
08:52 - cue exclamation point again not
08:54 - intuitive whatsoever
08:55 - but this will quit bim without saving
08:58 - the file when you do that it's going to
08:59 - exit now obviously we didn't make any
09:01 - changes so
09:02 - we still have the original file now
09:04 - let's talk about a few other things you
09:05 - can do
09:05 - so first of all to navigate vim there's
09:08 - a ton of shortcuts like so many
09:10 - different things you can do
09:11 - to go to the end of the line go to the
09:12 - first word remove the first word delete
09:14 - the first word
09:15 - all kinds of crazy stuff and if you know
09:17 - how to use vim you can actually be
09:18 - really productive with just the keyboard
09:21 - and no mouse whatsoever
09:23 - anyways that's definitely not me but
09:25 - let's go through
09:26 - how to copy paste and highlight so if
09:28 - you want to start highlighting something
09:30 - in vim you go into command mode and you
09:31 - hit
09:32 - v now you're in visual mode and notice
09:34 - that you can start highlighting things
09:36 - in the file so this is called visual
09:37 - mode in visual mode there's a few other
09:39 - things you can do but anyways here we
09:41 - are
09:41 - i've highlighted the first word here
09:43 - hello now
09:44 - what you can do when you're highlighting
09:46 - is well you can copy and you can paste
09:48 - so if i want to copy this i can hit
09:50 - y and now it says three lines yanked and
09:53 - what that means is i have
09:54 - copied this text like yanking is the
09:56 - same thing as copying
09:58 - in vim so now i can navigate into the
10:00 - file where i want to paste this
10:02 - and while i'm in command mode i can hit
10:04 - p when i do that it's going to paste
10:06 - this wherever
10:07 - i have my cursor in the file so that's
10:10 - how you copy
10:11 - paste and highlight in vim now just to
10:14 - show you some of the cool things you can
10:15 - do with vim
10:16 - i will show you how to delete one word
10:18 - or one
10:19 - line at a time so let's go into insert
10:21 - mode
10:22 - and let's type some more stuff so we'll
10:25 - just go hello
10:26 - hello hello you guys can see how
10:27 - creative i am with my uh
10:29 - my words here all right so sorry
10:30 - something messed up and i had to restart
10:32 - vim anyways we're back
10:33 - um i'm just going to show you a few
10:35 - other cool commands you can use in vim
10:37 - they're not necessarily super useful but
10:38 - just showing you kind of
10:40 - what you can do in vim and the type of
10:42 - commands that they do have
10:44 - so first of all let's highlight some
10:45 - more stuff so let me highlight this word
10:47 - here
10:48 - uh so let's go in v mode now while i'm
10:50 - in visual mode if i want to delete the
10:52 - highlighted text
10:53 - i hit d on the keyboard and notice all
10:55 - that's gone i have deleted it
10:57 - now there's a few other things that we
10:58 - can do we can undo with the u command so
11:01 - when i type u
11:02 - that is how you undo there's another one
11:04 - you can redo so control plus r
11:07 - actually redo redoes whatever change you
11:09 - had i can now undo that
11:11 - again i know this is a ton of things not
11:13 - expecting you to remember them just
11:14 - showing you the kind of shortcuts they
11:15 - have
11:16 - now what else we can do is we can move
11:19 - forward one word we can remove one word
11:22 - uh we can paste after the cursor there's
11:24 - just so much
11:25 - but i will show you how we can move
11:27 - forward one word because that one is
11:29 - somewhat useful i guess if you want to
11:30 - navigate like word by word you can use
11:33 - w so w will skip forward one word again
11:35 - when you're in command mode
11:37 - and then to skip back one word you hit b
11:39 - now again i don't know
11:40 - why they came up with these um but you
11:42 - know you have b and you have w
11:44 - and that's how you can kind of navigate
11:45 - one word at a time through the file
11:47 - i don't know why that's super useful but
11:48 - there you go now if you wanted to move
11:50 - to the beginning of the line
11:52 - what you do is you hit zero this will
11:54 - move you to the beginning of the line
11:56 - now if you want to move to the end of
11:58 - the line what you do is you hold
12:00 - shift and then you press four because
12:02 - you're trying to access the dollar sign
12:03 - so this will move you to the end of
12:04 - whatever line you're currently on
12:06 - and again to go back to the beginning
12:07 - you hit zero now
12:09 - i can show you a ton more i think i'm
12:11 - going to stop it there just because
12:13 - there's not really
12:14 - much more value in showing you these
12:15 - you're going to have to look them up
12:16 - anyways
12:17 - but now let's quit so we'll do colon wq
12:20 - exclamation point to save there we go we
12:23 - closed vim and that was kind of my quick
12:24 - run through on
12:25 - vim so now that we've gone through vim
12:27 - and we've gone through nano i'm going to
12:28 - show you emacs
12:29 - a lot of people like emacs i don't
12:31 - really use emacs but i'll just show you
12:33 - how to install it on the machine
12:35 - so to do this you can do sudo sorry you
12:37 - actually don't need pseudo if you're
12:38 - signing as the root user but if you're
12:40 - not signed in as the root user
12:41 - you need sudo now i don't know if i've
12:44 - discussed
12:44 - sudo but sudo stands for super user do
12:48 - and when you are in the sudoers group or
12:50 - you are a part of the sudo group
12:52 - you have access to the sudo command so
12:54 - if you don't have permission to do
12:55 - something
12:56 - you just preface the command with sudo
12:58 - and that means super user do and then
13:00 - you're able to
13:00 - actually do that command so i probably
13:03 - should have mentioned that i apologize
13:04 - that it's this late in the series
13:06 - that i've talked about pseudo because
13:07 - you use that all the time but again that
13:09 - stands for
13:09 - super user do and it will grant you
13:11 - permission to do something
13:12 - assuming you are in the pseudo group and
13:15 - we talked about that in groups and
13:17 - users and all that okay so now we will
13:20 - go to emacs so to install emacs you can
13:22 - do
13:23 - apt hyphen get install emacs
13:26 - now if you're not the root user you're
13:27 - going to have to put sudo before that
13:29 - and then this will run and install emacs
13:31 - now i already have emacs installed here
13:33 - but this will probably prompt you
13:35 - with a yes or no answer like would you
13:36 - like to use this additional space
13:38 - just type y and then press enter and
13:41 - then wait a minute or two takes a few
13:42 - seconds and it will install emacs now to
13:44 - open emacs
13:45 - you simply type emacs right and then
13:47 - it's going to open up something that
13:48 - looks like this
13:49 - now that's literally all i'm going to
13:51 - show you for eback so well i'll show you
13:53 - how to close it as well
13:54 - there's a ton of other commands for
13:55 - emacs again these editors are really
13:58 - just up to your preference you can use
13:59 - whatever you want and there's a few
14:01 - other ones as well i'm just showing kind
14:02 - of the more popular ones
14:04 - but to exit emacs you use control and
14:06 - then z
14:07 - and that will close emacs so there is a
14:10 - lot more to all of these editors the
14:12 - idea behind this video is to give you an
14:14 - introduction
14:15 - allow you to open the editor and close
14:17 - the edit editor which believe it or not
