00:00 - in this video I will share with you five
00:02 - practical python projects that will help
00:04 - you develop the skills that you need to
00:06 - become a Python Master these projects
00:08 - are in a variety of different areas they
00:10 - go over many different topics and the
00:12 - point of this is that they will give you
00:13 - a very broad knowledge of python and
00:16 - make you very comfortable and competent
00:18 - working with the language each project
00:19 - that I put on this list will teach you a
00:21 - different skill it will be something
00:23 - practical that you could actually apply
00:25 - in the real world and you will learn a
00:27 - ton so without further Ado let's get
00:29 - into the video I encourage you to work
00:31 - on these projects and practice your
00:33 - skill just like I practice my skill of
00:35 - my sponsor Segways before we get started
00:38 - I need to thank lenod for sponsoring
00:40 - this video I've been using and working
00:42 - with lenode for nearly three years now
00:44 - and they've consistently been my go-to
00:46 - choice for hosting my applications and
00:48 - servers in fact right now I'm using the
00:50 - node to host the official Tech with Tim
00:52 - Discord bot a website multiple of my
00:54 - domains and a kubernetes cluster now
00:57 - lenode was just recently acquired by
00:59 - Akamai and as a part of this acquisition
01:01 - they're going to be adding more than a
01:02 - dozen new data centers around the world
01:04 - in the next year lenode makes it super
01:06 - easy to spin up servers with their
01:08 - one-click app Marketplace and have tons
01:10 - of written guides and YouTube videos on
01:12 - their channel to help you get started
01:13 - now if you're having any issues you can
01:15 - reach out to the 24 7 support team and
01:18 - actually talk with a real human being
01:19 - now the node's pricing is simple with no
01:22 - hidden fees and full transparency and
01:24 - you can test out the node services for
01:26 - free by using the link in the
01:27 - description and claiming a 100.60 day
01:30 - credit for any new accounts it's been an
01:32 - absolute pleasure to work with lenode
01:34 - over the past few years and one last
01:36 - thank you to them for sponsoring this
01:37 - video alright so I'll get into the
01:39 - project ideas in a second but I just
01:41 - want to mention that the ideas here are
01:43 - just that their ideas they're meant to
01:44 - be inspiration so please add your own
01:46 - creative touches think about ways that
01:48 - you can kind of change the project
01:50 - around make it more applicable to you
01:52 - I'm just trying to give you some
01:53 - inspiration here and give you an excuse
01:55 - to go work on a python project if you
01:57 - want some full python project
01:59 - walkthroughs you want some more help
02:00 - going through them then you can check
02:02 - out my course programmingexpert.io we
02:04 - have a bunch of projects on there
02:05 - hundreds of practice questions and
02:07 - that's going to give you a lot of
02:08 - resources if you're just trying to get
02:09 - better at python anyways let's dive into
02:11 - project number one which has to do with
02:13 - scripting and automation so python is
02:16 - one of the best languages when it comes
02:17 - to writing automation scripts command
02:19 - line tools and really anything that kind
02:21 - of manipulates files or folders or
02:24 - directories or does I guess like a
02:26 - repetitive human task so I'll give you a
02:28 - concrete example of something I built
02:30 - recently in Python that's kind of an
02:32 - automation tool so a lot of you know
02:33 - that I work for a startup right now and
02:35 - at that startup we have a few game
02:36 - developers now for each game they make
02:38 - there's kind of like a template that has
02:40 - some pre-built components has a little
02:42 - bit of pre-written code some stuff
02:43 - that's going to be kind of the same for
02:45 - each game uh and you know some metadata
02:47 - files and some information that they
02:49 - kind of need to fill in now previously I
02:50 - had this big long like documentation
02:52 - sheet that said okay dude this this is
02:54 - this and it was like you know 10 steps
02:56 - to set up the game but there was always
02:57 - mistakes people were kind of forgetting
02:59 - fields uh and it just was time consuming
03:01 - right for them to go and read the
03:03 - documentation so I said you know what
03:04 - I'm gonna write a quick tool that will
03:06 - just kind of do this for so we have this
03:07 - template folder so what my tool does is
03:10 - you run it it asks you you know what's
03:11 - the name of the game what's the
03:13 - description what's all of the metadata
03:14 - required then it copies the template
03:17 - folder paste it change the name of the
03:18 - folder goes in fills in all of the
03:20 - metadata deletes any unnecessary files
03:22 - adds new files and just sets up the game
03:25 - so that it's pretty much click and run
03:26 - and then the game developer just goes
03:28 - into the folder writes all of their game
03:30 - development code and then we're good to
03:32 - go I know if they use that tool that
03:33 - everything's set up properly and there
03:35 - we are we've just you know done
03:37 - everything that usually would take them
03:39 - you know 20 30 minutes in about a 30
03:41 - second kind of I don't know input to the
03:43 - script so those are the type of things
03:45 - I'm talking about for this first project
03:46 - they don't have to be overly complicated
03:48 - they can just be something that really
03:50 - makes your life easier and kind of does
03:52 - some file operation right there's some
03:54 - manipulation of things that usually
03:56 - you're doing manually that you could
03:57 - probably spend about an hour writing a
03:59 - script or they're just going to clean
04:01 - everything up and make it so that you're
04:02 - not going to make any mistakes and
04:03 - everything's going to be a lot faster
04:05 - another example here is to like clean up
04:07 - a bunch of temporary files or
04:09 - unnecessary files you could literally
04:10 - write a script that just deletes
04:12 - everything from your downloads folder
04:13 - that would be like 10 lines of code but
04:15 - now you just double click this rather
04:17 - than you know going into the downloads
04:18 - folder selecting everything deleting it
04:20 - I know it's okay it's gonna be you know
04:22 - five ten second difference if you do
04:23 - something like that but the point is
04:25 - python is really good at working with
04:26 - files it's very fast to write code when
04:29 - you're trying to do these kind of
04:30 - scripts so think about how you can
04:32 - automate some of the activities in your
04:33 - life and start creating basic Python
04:36 - scripts that do that if you can get
04:37 - familiar with the OS module the pathlib
04:39 - module you're going to feel like you
04:41 - have kind of superpowers when it comes
04:42 - to file operations manipulations
04:45 - searching for stuff on your computer and
04:47 - just going to make you a really good
04:48 - python developer alright moving on to
04:50 - project idea number two now this is
04:53 - going to be in the web development
04:54 - category now this again is one of the
04:56 - more practical things you can do with
04:58 - python building websites building rest
05:00 - apis building back ends that's what
05:03 - python is good at now I wouldn't
05:04 - necessarily recommend using python for
05:06 - building an entire front end although
05:08 - you can definitely create something that
05:09 - looks decent using something like Django
05:11 - or Flash and kind of sprinkling in a bit
05:13 - of HTML JavaScript CSS Etc but if you
05:17 - can build something with python that has
05:19 - an authentication system right that's
05:21 - going to be a really good learning
05:22 - experience and something that is going
05:24 - to look great on a resume so I'll give
05:26 - you a few ideas here for kind of Web
05:28 - projects to build with python that
05:29 - aren't massive but that are definitely
05:31 - worth doing and that will teach you a
05:33 - bunch of skills so the first one I'm
05:34 - going to give you here is to build a
05:36 - Twitter club now I know that might seem
05:37 - kind of intimidating at first there's a
05:39 - lot of stuff in Twitter but whenever
05:41 - you're building a social media clone if
05:43 - you actually take it kind of down to the
05:45 - Bare Bones like what are the absolutely
05:47 - necessary features it's pretty simple to
05:49 - implement these think about Twitter
05:50 - someone posted tweet you can reply to a
05:53 - tweet you can like a tweet you can
05:54 - retweet it really that's the core
05:56 - functionality that you need to have and
05:58 - then from there you go and you say okay
05:59 - I'm gonna add a profile where you view
06:01 - all of this user's tweets I'm going to
06:03 - add a search page where you can search
06:04 - for a user slowly you can add on a lot
06:06 - of features and this is a project you
06:08 - can work on for a really long time and
06:10 - shows a lot of skill if you're going to
06:12 - put this on something like a resume so
06:13 - the reason I would recommend something
06:14 - like this is that first you have to
06:16 - build your authentication system you
06:17 - have to be signing in users signing out
06:19 - users making sure you have unique
06:21 - usernames you're going to have to have a
06:22 - database you're going to have to
06:24 - associate data with users you're going
06:26 - to have to have a way to quickly search
06:27 - for users there's a lot of skills baked
06:29 - into a project like this and even though
06:31 - it's not necessarily original it's
06:33 - something you can put your own spin up
06:34 - for example I tried to create on a live
06:36 - stream a typing racer clone you guys
06:39 - know the game where you like type
06:40 - against someone and you're trying to do
06:41 - the fastest words per minute except
06:43 - rather than doing just regular sentences
06:45 - it was code so it's like a code racer
06:47 - game right I think that's what I called
06:49 - it um in the live stream I didn't end up
06:51 - finishing this project it was kind of a
06:53 - big project that I tried to take on in
06:54 - too short of a time but again another
06:56 - great idea you have the authentication
06:57 - system you're gonna have to have live
06:59 - socket States where people are actually
07:00 - interacting with each other in live time
07:03 - a lot of stuff to learn from a project
07:04 - like that and something that's great to
07:06 - talk about on a resume alright so the
07:08 - next project I have for you has to do
07:10 - with web scraping and data collection
07:12 - now for this project I recommend that
07:14 - you do something where you're grabbing a
07:16 - large amount of information either from
07:18 - an API where you're actually scraping a
07:20 - website and grabbing all of this data
07:22 - yourself that's probably the preferred
07:23 - approach but if you can't find a website
07:25 - that has the data that you want then
07:26 - maybe you go with an API that will kind
07:28 - of give all of it to you and then you
07:30 - take all of this data you parse through
07:31 - it you pull out the meaningful parts and
07:33 - then you display it in some kind of
07:35 - dashboard now in Python it is a bit
07:37 - difficult to create graphical user
07:39 - interfaces so you could do something
07:40 - simple like use map plot lib right and
07:42 - you can kind of set up you know charts
07:44 - or graphs or whatever you want to do
07:46 - with that or you could create a front
07:47 - end and actually display it on the front
07:49 - end if you have you know some basic JS
07:51 - CSS HTML skills so kind of up to you in
07:54 - terms of the display but I recommend
07:56 - having you know two distinct parts of
07:58 - the project where you have your data
07:59 - collection kind of parsing through the
08:00 - data cleaning it up knowing how to work
08:02 - with larger pieces of data Maybe use
08:04 - something like pandas maybe you're
08:06 - saving stuff in large Json files or
08:09 - databases and then you actually go and
08:11 - kind of display this and make it a bit
08:12 - Visual and graphical now in terms of a
08:14 - specific project I recommend you do
08:16 - something with GitHub so you can do
08:18 - something like a GitHub language tracker
08:20 - which is going to track all of the most
08:22 - popular programming languages based on I
08:24 - guess percentage of language in GitHub
08:27 - repositories I think that's how you
08:28 - would do that or you could do something
08:30 - where it shows you your commit history
08:31 - so maybe use the GitHub API you grab
08:34 - information about your commits your
08:36 - logging you know information about
08:37 - different pull requests you have open
08:38 - whatever you want to do but I would do
08:40 - something that's counter related to
08:41 - programming or a field that you're
08:43 - interested in and that way it's going to
08:45 - look good on a resume you can be a bit
08:46 - more passionate about it when you're
08:47 - kind of talking about it and if you do
08:49 - something related to GitHub then that's
08:51 - something that's a bit more practical I
08:52 - would say right because you can actually
08:54 - create a tool that will help you
08:55 - visualize okay these are all the issues
08:57 - I have open on GitHub these are all my
08:59 - pull requests I know that already exists
09:01 - but we're trying to work on projects
09:02 - here that build skills so using a bit of
09:04 - web scraping using different apis
09:06 - parsing that data displaying in a
09:08 - graphical format I think this makes a
09:10 - really good project and it's going to
09:11 - teach you a lot of great python skills
09:13 - alright so moving on to project four I
09:16 - have to do something related to game
09:17 - development now I know that python is
09:20 - not the best when it comes to game
09:21 - development a lot of people are probably
09:22 - going to hate on this because you're not
09:24 - going to create AAA game in Python
09:25 - anything you make in Python that's a
09:27 - game you're probably not going to put
09:28 - like on the app store or something like
09:29 - that right however doing games in Python
09:32 - for me is what really got me into
09:33 - programming it's what taught me a ton of
09:35 - skills and really I credit that to me
09:38 - even having this YouTube channel when I
09:40 - was younger I used to make so many games
09:41 - in Python because I just loved doing it
09:44 - I loved playing games I loved making the
09:46 - games and it was a really fun way for me
09:48 - to practice a ton of python skills so I
09:50 - would highly recommend to anyone here
09:51 - that you know maybe didn't like the
09:53 - other projects as much just wants to
09:54 - work on something solely for fun or as a
09:56 - hobby project make some games in Python
09:58 - they're really fun and they teach you a
10:00 - lot so I'll give you a few different
10:01 - kind of game development ideas and just
10:04 - by the way I would recommend to use a
10:05 - module like Pi game although there is a
10:07 - module pie monk which is pretty useful
10:10 - if you want to do like physics related
10:11 - stuff where um you know all the physics
10:13 - is implemented already so you have like
10:15 - bouncing gravity different shapes and
10:17 - objects I have a tutorial on my channel
10:19 - if you guys want to check it out anyways
10:20 - a few game development ideas I would
10:22 - make something like Battleship brick
10:24 - breaker Space Invaders Hong you could do
10:27 - Flappy Bird you could create like a
10:28 - Mario cup platformer clone you could
10:31 - make Pokemon if you wanted to do that
10:32 - there's all kinds of different things
10:34 - you can do and if you look up you know
10:35 - python game ideas you'll probably see a
10:37 - bunch from my channel you'll see a bunch
10:39 - of other really impressive games made in
10:41 - Python Now by working on a game you get
10:43 - a whole different skill set in terms of
10:45 - Designing a program laying out a screen
10:47 - all of the math related to like the
10:49 - geometry and how you do collision and
10:51 - how you implement uh you know like
10:53 - jumping writing gravity so you're
10:55 - actually applying oftentimes I find like
10:57 - some basic physics or math or
10:59 - trigonometry tree and it's cool because
11:00 - you're taking stuff that's not just
11:02 - programming and kind of implementing it
11:04 - into your code you also have to figure
11:06 - okay how do I spawn objects on the
11:07 - screen how do I reset a game how do I
11:09 - make this kind of scalable so I could
11:11 - add new levels or new objects it gives
11:13 - you in my opinion a decent perspective
11:15 - kind of program design and I think it's
11:17 - something useful that a lot of you could
11:19 - find some value in so moving on to my
11:21 - next project and this is to do something
11:22 - related to web 3. now I know a lot of
11:25 - people instantly hate when they hear
11:26 - crypto they hear web3 if you're one of
11:28 - those people I would say relax I'm not
11:31 - scamming you I don't have a coin to sell
11:32 - you I'm just trying to give some new
11:35 - ideas some things that are going to be
11:36 - interesting that is kind of you know
11:38 - relevant with the trends in Tech today
11:40 - so a lot of people are into web 3 and I
11:42 - think that it would be a cool idea to do
11:43 - something like querying the blockchain
11:45 - grabbing information about the most
11:47 - recent block you know graphing the trend
11:49 - in difficulty grabbing your wallet
11:51 - address and creating maybe even like a
11:53 - blockchain wallet you could do that in
11:55 - something like python you could create a
11:57 - blockchain wall it allows you to send
11:58 - ethereum receive ethereum them view all
12:00 - of your different transactions track the
12:02 - balance of your account over time
12:03 - there's a lot of cool stuff you can do
12:05 - with web3 just gotta open up your mind
12:06 - to the possibility that not all of this
12:08 - is a scam I know many of you watching
12:10 - that don't feel this way but anytime I
12:11 - talk about web3 I just get spammed in
12:13 - the comments with people like hating on
12:15 - it so I felt the need to add that in
12:16 - there anyways a ton of cool web3
12:18 - projects I'm actually working with
12:19 - someone right now who has a really cool
12:21 - idea related it's like a web 3 lottery
12:23 - where he's kind of tracking all of the
12:25 - transactions that are being sent to an
12:26 - address and he's doing this cool kind of
12:28 - cryptographic math thing where he's
12:30 - rolling a lottery and sending a random
12:32 - amount of Bitcoin to a certain address I
12:34 - don't want to spoil his idea too much
12:35 - but there's a lot of cool stuff you can
12:37 - do and you can do this completely in
12:39 - Python which is what I'm doing with him
12:40 - alright so that did complete my five
12:43 - project ideas now I will add in a few
12:45 - bonuses here that I wanted to leave
12:46 - until the end and this is of course like
12:48 - machine learning data science there's
12:50 - all kinds of stuff you can do with
12:51 - machine learning and data science and
12:53 - python but I don't like including those
12:54 - as projects in this video because they
12:57 - are kind of a whole different field of
12:58 - programming and it's a very different
13:00 - skill set if you want to get into
13:02 - machine learning data science that's
13:03 - really a different career path than all
13:05 - of the other kind of projects that I
13:07 - just walked you through so of course you
13:08 - can do something like that it's
13:09 - obviously going to make you a better
13:10 - python developer to be working with
13:12 - machine learning models understanding
13:14 - how to analyze large-scale data but
13:16 - again doesn't necessarily fit kind of
13:18 - the theme or topic of this video so with
13:20 - that said I will wrap it up here hope
13:21 - you guys enjoyed hope you found some
13:23 - inspiration and some project ideas let
13:25 - me know what you're working on in the
13:26 - comments down below and I look forward
13:28 - to seeing you in another YouTube video
13:34 - [Music]
13:37 - thank you
