00:03 - foreign
00:09 - tools like chat GPT exist and all of a
00:12 - sudden a lot of you want to dive into
00:14 - machine learning and artificial
00:15 - intelligence now I'm not here to
00:17 - validate that decision or to tell you
00:19 - that's the best possible path to go down
00:20 - but I am here to provide you a road map
00:23 - and make it as easy and stress-free as
00:25 - possible for you to dive into this world
00:27 - I myself learned quite a bit about
00:29 - machine learning and AI back when I was
00:31 - in university this was about three years
00:32 - ago I actually have a ton of videos on
00:34 - this channel related to machine learning
00:36 - and artificial intelligence and you can
00:38 - check those out for the link in the
00:39 - description I'll pop some of them up on
00:41 - the screen so I have a really good sense
00:43 - of what it takes to dive into this field
00:44 - what kind of algorithms you should be
00:46 - learning the level of math you need to
00:48 - know what programming language you
00:49 - should learn libraries and the next more
00:52 - advanced steps that you can take if you
00:53 - really are getting serious about that so
00:55 - with that said let's dive in and let me
00:57 - share with you how to learn machine
00:58 - learning and artificial intelligence in
01:00 - 2023 so let's begin here by walking
01:03 - through the steps that's involved in
01:05 - training a machine learning model or
01:06 - really developing some kind of
01:07 - artificial intelligence you're going to
01:09 - realize very quickly here that very
01:11 - little of what you're going to do as a
01:13 - machine learning engineer or as someone
01:15 - who's interested in artificial
01:16 - intelligence is actually building
01:18 - machine learning models or artificial
01:19 - intelligence a lot of this has to do
01:21 - with data pre-processing and also things
01:23 - like deploying testing and validating
01:26 - your model so keep that in mind this is
01:28 - not as glorious and as glamorous as a
01:30 - field as you might make it out to be and
01:31 - there's a lot of very frustrating time
01:33 - consuming and difficult work that goes
01:36 - into actually being successful in
01:37 - training machine learning models and
01:39 - creating artificial intelligence anyways
01:41 - let me walk you through the steps so
01:43 - step one in any machine learning
01:44 - application or project is to define the
01:47 - problem what is the problem what are you
01:49 - trying to solve what are your goals and
01:50 - objectives and how is machine learning
01:52 - going to help you do that now step two
01:54 - is to pick the data that you're going to
01:56 - be using for your model so data
01:57 - collection where are you getting this
01:59 - data from how are you storing it and how
02:01 - are you going to decide what data you
02:03 - actually need the next step is going to
02:05 - be data cleaning oftentimes when you
02:07 - collect data especially if you're
02:09 - getting it from the internet some kind
02:10 - of Open Source you're going to need to
02:12 - clean this data and get rid of a bunch
02:13 - of information that's unnecessary too
02:15 - much data can confuse a machine learning
02:17 - model too little obviously could be not
02:19 - enough to train it and you have to be
02:20 - careful how you're cleaning this data
02:22 - and putting it in a format such that
02:24 - it's usable for your model the next step
02:26 - is going to be data selection so now you
02:28 - should have this massive amount of data
02:30 - depending on the problem obviously
02:31 - they're going to be training a model on
02:33 - now you need to actually select the
02:35 - specific pieces of data that you want to
02:36 - use to train the model not all of your
02:39 - data is going to be relevant maybe
02:40 - there's some filters you need to apply
02:41 - there's a lot of stuff that could go on
02:43 - in this step next is going to be your
02:45 - model architecture or selecting a model
02:48 - oftentimes you don't need to reinvent
02:50 - the wheel you don't need to create your
02:51 - own custom model you simply need to pick
02:54 - an existing one and then train it using
02:55 - your data so once you pick your model
02:57 - now you're going to train the model so
02:59 - you're going to feed all of your cleaned
03:01 - and processed data into that model and
03:03 - then you're going to test and evaluate
03:05 - your model and make sure that it's
03:07 - actually working as you expect once you
03:09 - do that you're going to repeat this step
03:10 - countless times until you get a model
03:12 - that has an accuracy that you are happy
03:14 - with and then if you're going in a
03:16 - production environment you are going to
03:17 - deploy this model so the reason I wanted
03:19 - to share these steps with you is just so
03:21 - you have a better picture of what's
03:23 - actually involved and what you're going
03:24 - to be doing if you get into this field
03:26 - most of your work is not going to be
03:28 - training a model coming up with a model
03:30 - architecture and doing all of that fun
03:32 - stuff you might see in YouTube videos or
03:34 - hear about In Articles a lot of it is
03:36 - going to have to do with data collecting
03:37 - data processing data and then testing
03:39 - and evaluating your model and continuing
03:42 - to repeat that process until you hit a
03:44 - point that you are satisfied with so
03:46 - after listening to those steps some of
03:47 - you might be a little bit concerned that
03:49 - your computer may not be powerful enough
03:51 - to actually execute those steps and
03:53 - train kind of more advanced deep
03:54 - learning models now if that's the case
03:57 - you don't have to worry because I'm
03:58 - actually giving away an RTX 4080 this is

05:12 - it's virtual go and check out their
05:14 - itinerary a ton of really cool stuff
05:17 - going on alright so now I'm going to get
05:18 - a bit more serious and structured and
05:20 - share with you kind of step by step what
05:21 - you need to do if you want to get into
05:23 - machine learning and AI so step one is
05:25 - going to be to learn some kind of
05:27 - programming language that you can do
05:28 - machine learning and AI in now the
05:30 - language I typically recommend here is
05:32 - python obviously python is a very
05:34 - well-rounded language you can use it for
05:36 - a bunch of stuff not just machine
05:37 - learning and Ai and it's worth learning
05:39 - even if you're not getting into this
05:40 - field but it's also the top choice for
05:42 - performing machine learning and
05:44 - artificial intelligence there's all
05:45 - kinds of libraries that use Python that
05:47 - make it really easy to deploy or not
05:49 - deploy but to create deep learning
05:51 - models or machine learning models and
05:53 - it's what I would recommend you learn
05:55 - first you do not need to be a Python
05:57 - Master but I would say you need to be
05:58 - competent in the language you need to
06:00 - understand things like for Loops classes
06:03 - objects and gets you kind of an
06:04 - intermediate programming level if you
06:06 - wanted to do that you could check out my
06:07 - course
06:08 - programmingexpert.io from the link in
06:10 - the description Additionally you may
06:12 - learn something like rust this is not a
06:14 - language I know or that I've looked at
06:15 - so I'm not going to recommend that and
06:17 - there's some other more specific machine
06:19 - learning languages you can look at kind
06:21 - of related to data science but again I'm
06:23 - not going to recommend those I'm going
06:24 - to recommend python to pretty much
06:26 - everyone here so step one Learn Python
06:29 - get decent at it you don't need to be an
06:31 - expert so moving on the next thing on my
06:33 - roadmap here is going to be to learn
06:34 - some math or to have some kind of
06:36 - foundational math background now I
06:39 - typically recommend that people that are
06:40 - diving into machine learning and Ai and
06:42 - actually want to understand what's going
06:43 - on like they want to look at the math
06:45 - they want to see what's behind just this
06:46 - basic algorithm they want to have some
06:48 - intuition on what's going on and what's
06:50 - happening should have a understanding of
06:53 - linear algebra basic calculus like
06:55 - something you'd take in grade 12 or
06:57 - first year university and then probably
06:59 - understand things like matrices vectors
07:01 - multi-dimensional math and just be
07:03 - generally speaking okay at reading like
07:05 - mathematical notation and comfortable
07:08 - kind of digging into it a little bit I'm
07:10 - not telling you you have to be a math
07:11 - whiz I am not a math genius myself but I
07:14 - did go through two years of math courses
07:16 - in University these were the computer
07:17 - science math classes and that helped me
07:20 - tremendously when I was learning machine
07:21 - learn so if you don't know the math it's
07:24 - fine you can still continue here but I
07:25 - will warn you it's going to be much more
07:27 - difficult to really grasp what's going
07:29 - on and I'd highly recommend you don't
07:31 - skip this if you have access to these
07:33 - kind of math courses alright so the next
07:35 - thing I'm going to recommend here is
07:36 - that you get familiar with some of the
07:38 - popular modules and libraries related to
07:41 - machine learning in Python I'm going to
07:43 - list them out you don't necessarily need
07:44 - to learn all of them but you should know
07:46 - what each of them is the goal of each
07:48 - library and if you're learning something
07:50 - like numpy which is the first library
07:52 - that I'm going to recommend I'd suggest
07:53 - that you spend a bit of time to
07:55 - understand some of the core functions
07:57 - and methods in that module because
07:59 - they're used quite a bit in different
08:00 - machine learning tutorials and not
08:02 - necessarily explained or kind of
08:05 - detailed as much as they should be so
08:06 - anyways the first module I'm going to
08:08 - rec command is numpy if you learn only
08:10 - one module this is the one that I would
08:11 - learn then you can look at something
08:13 - like scikit learn tensorflow Pi torch
08:16 - and then pandas pandas is more of a data
08:19 - science Library used to kind of import
08:21 - data manipulate data and oftentimes
08:23 - you're going to see this used in
08:24 - different machine learning tutorials
08:26 - again you don't have to learn all of
08:27 - these different libraries but you should
08:28 - be familiar with what they are maybe the
08:31 - difference between something like Pi
08:32 - torch and tensorflow and when you may
08:34 - want to use kind of each Library some
08:37 - tutorials will just tell you use a
08:39 - specific Library if I were you I'd want
08:41 - to have a bit more information on what
08:42 - that is and why you're using it before
08:44 - you dive right into that alright so
08:46 - finally my next step is to actually
08:47 - learn some machine learning algorithms I
08:50 - told you at the beginning of the video
08:51 - machine learning is not as glamorous as
08:53 - it seems there's a lot of other stuff
08:55 - you need to learn and understand to be
08:56 - good at it and that's why only at this
08:58 - point I'm actually telling you okay get
09:00 - into some machine learning algorithms
09:01 - and learn those now what I always
09:03 - suggest is that you learn these kind of
09:05 - foundational it's very straightforward
09:07 - and basic machine learning algorithms
09:09 - before you dive into stuff like deep
09:11 - learning neural networks convolutional
09:13 - neural networks Q learning reinforcement
09:15 - learning all of that stuff that you guys
09:17 - probably get really excited about so I'm
09:19 - going to share with you a few different
09:20 - algorithms that I would learn and I
09:22 - would really focus on learning the math
09:24 - Behind These because it's not overly
09:26 - complicated relative to some of the
09:28 - other stuff in the ML and AI world and
09:30 - if you can understand these core
09:31 - algorithms you can already do quite a
09:33 - bit of very interesting stuff that's not
09:36 - overly complicated so this will help you
09:37 - build a bit of confidence really
09:39 - understand what it means to perform
09:41 - machine learning and a lot of your more
09:43 - complicated machine learning stuff will
09:45 - kind of be based off some of the math
09:46 - and foundational information and Theory
09:49 - you get from these algorithms so let me
09:51 - go through the algorithms the first one
09:52 - is linear regression then you have
09:54 - logistic regression KNN this is a form
09:57 - of clustering so this is K nearest
09:59 - neighbors then I have support Vector
10:02 - machines then decision trees and naive
10:05 - Bayes these are very very popular
10:08 - algorithms you can find all kinds of
10:09 - videos articles tutorials whatever you
10:12 - want on these and in fact I have an
10:14 - entire series on my channel that goes
10:16 - through most of these different
10:17 - algorithms I also have a massive video
10:19 - on the free code Camp channel it's about
10:21 - seven hours long that walks you through
10:24 - a full overview and introduction of
10:26 - machine learning using tensorflow so
10:28 - I'll link that in the description as
10:29 - well anyways I would go through these
10:31 - different algorithms understand the math
10:33 - behind them practice applying them using
10:35 - some sample data sets again there's a
10:37 - million resources on the internet for
10:39 - each of them and only after you feel
10:41 - comfortable with these algorithms would
10:42 - I move on to the next step alright so at
10:45 - this point in time you'll have a really
10:47 - solid understanding of machine learning
10:49 - a really good foundation some good
10:51 - fundamentals you know python you know
10:53 - some basic libraries you know some math
10:55 - you've learned these core algorithms and
10:57 - now it's time to move on to some more
10:59 - advanced complicated and interesting
11:00 - machine learning topics I'm going to
11:03 - share with you a few different ideas
11:04 - here and kind of avenues you could go
11:06 - down but at this point it's up to you
11:07 - you need to do your own research and you
11:09 - need to figure out what you actually
11:11 - want to do what interests you and what
11:13 - you want to learn so when it comes to
11:15 - machine learning algorithms you have
11:16 - four classifications of algorithms the
11:18 - first is supervised then you have
11:20 - unsupervised semi-supervised and
11:23 - reinforcement learning these are the
11:24 - four different classifications within
11:26 - each classification as multiple
11:28 - different algorithms and methods of
11:30 - machine learning and AI to give you a
11:32 - prime example if we talk about
11:33 - supervised machine learning we're
11:35 - looking at something like classifiers
11:37 - something like neural networks where we
11:39 - have labeled data that means we have say
11:41 - an image of a cat and we have it labeled
11:43 - as cat we have an image of a dog it's
11:45 - labeled as dog and we use those labels
11:48 - to train our machine learning model and
11:50 - get it to a point where it's accurate
11:51 - enough to say predict if an image is a
11:53 - cat or a duck okay so neural networks
11:55 - would be under supervised machine
11:57 - learning something you could definitely
11:59 - learn if you were interested in that
12:00 - there's all different kinds of neural
12:02 - networks as well you know many different
12:04 - kinds so you guys can have a look at
12:06 - those and see the different names for
12:07 - them next we have unsupervised learning
12:10 - unsupervised learning is when you have
12:12 - data but you don't necessarily have a
12:14 - classification or a label for it so an
12:17 - example of unsupervised learning would
12:18 - be something like K means clustering
12:20 - this is a clustering algorithm that is
12:22 - essentially going to group different
12:24 - data points or different pieces of data
12:26 - based on similar properties so you may
12:28 - be trying to look in a data set for
12:30 - something you don't quite know yet and
12:32 - figure out different clusters or groups
12:34 - of maybe people or information or cells
12:36 - or whatever it is that you're clustering
12:38 - all right next we have a semi-supervised
12:41 - learning now I'm not an expert in this
12:42 - so I'm not going to explain it too much
12:44 - essentially this is a situation in which
12:46 - you have a little bit of labeled data
12:48 - but not enough to train the entire model
12:51 - on so you train the model on the limited
12:53 - data that is labeled and then you kind
12:55 - of perform a complicated process where
12:58 - you use non-labeled data to continue to
13:00 - improve the accuracy of the model so
13:02 - that's why it's semi-supervised you have
13:04 - some labeled data you have some
13:05 - non-label data you're kind of mixing and
13:07 - matching and trying to you get an
13:09 - accurate model lastly we have
13:11 - reinforcement learning this is the
13:13 - coolest one in my opinion an example of
13:15 - reinforcement learning would be training
13:17 - an AI how to play a game essentially
13:19 - what you're doing is reinforcing certain
13:21 - actions and maybe I guess
13:23 - non-reinforcing I don't know what the
13:24 - opposite of that would be other actions
13:27 - where you're telling the model you did
13:28 - this that's good keep doing that you did
13:30 - this that's bad stop doing that so
13:32 - you're reinforcing specific behavior
13:33 - attempting to reach some kind of goal I
13:36 - actually did a reinforcement learning
13:38 - video where I used an evolutionary
13:39 - algorithm to train an AI how to play
13:41 - Flappy Bird again entire tutorial on
13:44 - this channel I will leave that in the
13:45 - description alright so that said I think
