00:00 - the next time you're in a technical
00:01 - interview remember this one tip and that
00:03 - is to always share your thought process
00:06 - it doesn't matter if you already know
00:07 - the answer or if you have no idea what
00:09 - you're doing walk through everything
00:11 - you're thinking step by step from the
00:13 - very beginning of the problem all the
00:15 - way until you write your last line of
00:16 - code now this does two things first of
00:18 - all it shows the interviewer that you
00:20 - know how to break down problems you know
00:22 - how to problem solve and that you are
00:24 - thinking you're not just rushing to an
00:25 - answer or a solution the second thing it
00:28 - does is allow the interviewer to guide
00:30 - you and give you hints if you're going
00:31 - in the wrong direction in most the
00:33 - interviews that I've passed I haven't
00:35 - been completely correct but because I
00:37 - shared my thought process the
00:38 - interviewer was able to nudge me in the
00:40 - right direction and give me enough
00:41 - information or help so I got the answer
00:43 - eventually at the end now if you're
00:45 - still having trouble breaking into Tech

00:49 - introduction course that shares with you
