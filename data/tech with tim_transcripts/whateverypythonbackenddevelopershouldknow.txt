00:00 - now the reality is if you want to be a
00:02 - back-end developer of any kind you have
00:04 - to understand databases this is a very
00:06 - very important part of your job there is
00:08 - so much stuff related to this and that's
00:10 - going to come with learning SQL but you
00:12 - need to understand how to structure
00:14 - databases create them query them run SQL
00:16 - commands and I would also be familiar
00:18 - with nosql databases and understand a
00:20 - little bit about how to structure your
00:22 - data in a nosql database because that's
00:24 - different than working with a SQL
00:25 - database with a nosql database you're
00:27 - fairly Limited in terms of query
00:29 - operations due to the limited structure
00:31 - that's imposed so the way you structure
00:33 - your data is much different and you end
00:35 - up having a lot of redundant data that's
00:37 - actually kind of part of the design
00:39 - process of working with a nosql database
