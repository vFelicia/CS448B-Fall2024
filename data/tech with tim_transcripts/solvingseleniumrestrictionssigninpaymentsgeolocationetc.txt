00:00 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:01 - youtube video so in today's video i'm
00:04 - going to show you how to get past some
00:06 - common problems and issues when you're
00:08 - using selenium now a while ago i made a
00:10 - selenium tutorial series i probably made
00:13 - this about a year and a half ago i'll
00:14 - leave a link to it in the description
00:16 - but what selenium is is a framework that
00:18 - allows you to automate your browser so
00:20 - you can automatically click on things
00:22 - you can download things you can scrape
00:24 - stuff off of websites you can just
00:26 - automate pretty much any task you can
00:28 - make a bot that buys you you know a new
00:30 - shirt or a pair of sneakers or whatever
00:31 - it is that you would normally do as a
00:33 - human in the browser you can automate
00:35 - that with selenium however a lot of
00:37 - websites have advanced security and they
00:39 - can detect when you're using selenium
00:41 - and a lot of you left comments on that
00:43 - series saying that you couldn't get past
00:45 - certain fields or forms or you were
00:47 - running into errors where you were being
00:48 - detected as a bot so in this video i'm
00:51 - going to show you how to get past that
00:53 - and how you can use selenium without the
00:55 - websites knowing that you are a bot and
00:57 - without being limited in specific
00:59 - features so we'll get into that in a
01:01 - second but i first want to give you a
01:02 - demo of this problem actually happening
01:05 - so i have a regular selenium script in
01:07 - front of me you can see i'm importing
01:09 - all my webdriver stuff and what this
01:11 - script actually does is it opens up
01:13 - alibaba and it tries to sign in and then
01:16 - actually search for a product and buy it
01:18 - however you're going to see that when i
01:20 - try to sign in here it actually doesn't
01:22 - let me because it says that my device is
01:24 - a bot or it's not a recognized machine
01:26 - or something along those lines so let me
01:28 - go ahead and run the code here and show
01:30 - you the error that we're going to get
01:32 - so let's run
01:34 - let me just make this full screen so we
01:35 - can see it and now watch what's going to
01:37 - happen so my code is going to
01:39 - automatically close the pop-up it's
01:40 - going to click the join button it's
01:42 - going to try to sign in with google and
01:44 - then as soon as i try to sign in here
01:46 - it's going to tell me that this browser
01:47 - or app may not be secure so it says try
01:50 - using a different browser if you're
01:51 - already using a supported browser you
01:52 - can try again to sign in so i'm not able
01:55 - to get past this google sign-in because
01:57 - this can actually detect that i am using
02:00 - selenium and using a bot so in this
02:02 - video i'm going to show you how to get
02:03 - past this specifically but what i'm
02:05 - going to show you how to do should work
02:07 - for any other bot detection security and
02:09 - allow you really to use selenium freely
02:12 - without any restrictions so with that
02:14 - said let's go ahead and get started
02:19 - [Music]
02:24 - all right so to be able to get past
02:26 - these restrictions with selenium what
02:27 - we're gonna do is use a piece of
02:29 - software called camellio now camilo is
02:31 - the sponsor of this video but what this
02:34 - platform allows you to do is actually
02:36 - spoof and change your browser
02:38 - fingerprint change your ip address by
02:40 - using something like a proxy and
02:42 - essentially hide the fact that you are a
02:44 - bot and make it appear as though you are
02:45 - a real human user interacting with the
02:48 - website it's a really awesome platform
02:50 - i'm going to show you all of the
02:51 - features in it in a second but
02:53 - essentially what this means is that you
02:55 - can use selenium the exact same way you
02:57 - would have before there's just a few
02:59 - setup steps beforehand where you're
03:00 - going to create a camellio browser
03:02 - instance and you're going to use that to
03:04 - actually interact with the website
03:06 - rather than the regular chrome driver or
03:08 - firefox driver or whatever driver you
03:10 - would have used again all this is going
03:12 - to do is change the browser fingerprint
03:14 - and allow you to kind of change your
03:16 - location language all of that kind of
03:18 - stuff such that you can interact with a
03:20 - website without the website knowing that
03:22 - you are a bot or that you are using
03:24 - selenium so the first thing that we're
03:26 - going to have to do here is we're going
03:27 - to have to make an account on camellia
03:29 - now camellio is paid software i already
03:32 - have a paid account with them but if you
03:34 - want to get access to the software for
03:36 - free then what you can do is just reach
03:38 - out to them i'll leave a link to their
03:39 - website in the description you can
03:41 - request a free trial and if you say that
03:43 - you came from my video then they should
03:45 - give you a free trial and you'll be able
03:46 - to access the platform for a few days or
03:49 - whatever it is that they end up giving
03:50 - you anyways you can do that to try it
03:52 - out before you actually have to pay for
03:54 - anything so what we're going to do is
03:55 - make an account of course i already have
03:57 - an account and once you sign in then
03:59 - what you can do is just go to downloads
04:00 - so i'm going to go to downloads here and
04:02 - then what we want to do is install the
04:04 - camilo installer now camellia works for
04:06 - all kinds of other things as well this
04:08 - isn't just for selenium and you'll note
04:10 - here that they have a mobile installer
04:12 - as well we're not going to deal with
04:13 - that in this video we just want the
04:15 - desktop installer so this is for windows
04:17 - i'm going to click on the download link
04:19 - it's going to download i'm going to run
04:20 - through the installer and then i will
04:22 - have camellio installed now i already
04:24 - have it installed on my computer so i'm
04:26 - just going to open up the program and
04:27 - then we'll go from there all right so
04:29 - i've just opened the camellio
04:30 - application now the way that i've opened
04:32 - this is i've just ran through the
04:34 - installer i've then just typed in
04:35 - camellio ran the app signed into my
04:38 - account and then i was brought to a page
04:40 - that looked like this this is their
04:41 - graphical user interface now inside of
04:44 - here you can actually create browser
04:46 - instances you can create things known as
04:47 - profiles and this allows you to actually
04:49 - open up the browser manually go through
04:52 - and use the browser from say a different
04:54 - location or from a different device or
04:56 - operating system well i'm going to kind
04:57 - of talk to you about how all this stuff
04:59 - works so every time that you go to a
05:02 - website you're going to have a
05:03 - fingerprint associated with your browser
05:06 - now this fingerprint is just data about
05:07 - the machine that you're on the operating
05:09 - system that you're using the browser
05:11 - that you have open your ip address your
05:14 - location your time zone all of this type
05:16 - of stuff now the reason why this
05:18 - fingerprint is going to be kind of
05:19 - passed on to the website is because it
05:21 - needs to know what location you're from
05:24 - mostly what language you're speaking all
05:26 - of these other things so we can actually
05:28 - verify if it wants to allow you to go on
05:30 - the website right so there's a ton of
05:31 - different websites that just don't let
05:33 - you browse them if you're from a
05:34 - different country or maybe they're
05:36 - blocked into certain regions you guys
05:38 - know what i'm talking about for example
05:39 - like us netflix has a lot more movies
05:41 - and shows than canadian netflix does and
05:43 - you can't access us netflix unless you
05:45 - are in the us now how do you think it
05:47 - knows you're in the u.s well it uses
05:49 - your browser fingerprint anyways here in
05:51 - camellio you can change that fingerprint
05:54 - so you can make it look like you're
05:55 - browsing from a different country you
05:57 - can give yourself a different ip address
05:58 - by connecting to a proxy and you can
06:01 - very easily switch between different
06:02 - browser profiles that you set up
06:04 - yourself so say right now you want to
06:06 - connect from like mexico to a website
06:09 - you can do that and then very easily you
06:11 - can load another profile and connect
06:13 - from say the united states or some other
06:15 - random country so for now let's set up a
06:17 - camellio profile look at kind of how
06:19 - that works and how we just use the
06:21 - browser manually and then we'll connect
06:22 - it with selenium so from this interface
06:25 - here i'm just going to click on new
06:26 - profile and what this is going to allow
06:28 - me to do is set up a camellio profile by
06:31 - selecting a device operating system
06:33 - browser and language so for now i want
06:35 - to have a desktop device not a mobile
06:38 - device for the operating system i'm just
06:41 - going to go with windows
06:42 - and then for the browser i'm going to go
06:44 - with chrome of course you can do edge
06:46 - and firefox as well and then for the
06:48 - language i want this to be
06:51 - english okay so we can see we have
06:53 - desktop win32 windows 10 chrome 95
06:56 - english so i'm going to select this
06:58 - there should be a ton of different
06:59 - options here that you can go through all
07:01 - right so now i'm brought to this page
07:02 - where i can configure some settings for
07:04 - my profile now of course you guys can
07:06 - read through these they're pretty
07:08 - straightforward but you can change
07:09 - things like the time zone the geo
07:11 - location you can connect to a proxy and
07:14 - actually that's what we're going to do
07:15 - right now so whenever you're using
07:16 - camellio you should really be connecting
07:18 - to a proxy this is going to allow you to
07:21 - actually hide your geolocation if you
07:23 - don't connect to a proxy you're going to
07:25 - be using your regular ip address and so
07:27 - websites will actually know that you are
07:29 - from a certain part of the world now
07:31 - this is still not going to be able to
07:33 - detect that you are a bot because
07:35 - camellia will change the fingerprint of
07:36 - the browser but you do need to connect
07:38 - to a proxy if you want to change where
07:40 - you're showing up from so what region in
07:42 - the world you're browsing from so what
07:44 - i'm going to do is go to http here in
07:46 - proxy and now i'm going to show you how
07:48 - we can actually set up a proxy and then
07:50 - use that inside of here when we're
07:52 - connecting or creating a profile with
07:54 - camellia so the proxy that i want to use
07:56 - for this video is actually called bright
07:58 - data where it's from bright data which
08:00 - is a website that i'm going to go to now
08:02 - and start talking about all right so i'm
08:04 - here on the bright data website now this
08:06 - is simply a proxy provider they have all
08:08 - different types of proxies from data
08:10 - center proxies isp proxies residential
08:12 - proxies rotating proxies whatever you
08:15 - can imagine they probably have on here
08:17 - anyways this is paid as well but you can
08:19 - sign up for a free trial and get access
08:21 - to five or ten dollars in free credit if
08:23 - you want to follow along with this video
08:25 - anyways i'll leave a link to the
08:27 - description and what you're going to
08:28 - have to do is make an account sign up
08:29 - for the free trial get the credit and
08:31 - then what you can do is go to your user
08:33 - dashboard so i'm going to go to my user
08:35 - dashboard here the first thing i want to
08:37 - do is just go to proxies and just show
08:38 - you the different options and talk about
08:40 - which one we're going to use so we have
08:42 - mobile shared residential shared data
08:44 - center shared isp regular isp and then
08:47 - unblocked now i won't go through them in
08:49 - detail but what we're going to use here
08:51 - is just the shared residential proxy now
08:53 - what this is a rotating proxy that
08:55 - actually uses a real ip address from a
08:57 - real device so this means you really
09:00 - cannot get banned because you're
09:02 - actually using a legitimate device the
09:04 - only issue you might have here is that
09:06 - other people could be using this ip
09:07 - address as well that's why it's shared
09:10 - anyways the residential is probably the
09:12 - one that you want to use it's also
09:13 - relatively cheap however you could use a
09:16 - data center proxy an isp proxy mobile
09:18 - proxy really depends on your use case
09:21 - and you can read all about the different
09:22 - use cases for these right on the bright
09:24 - data website anyways i want to use the
09:27 - shared residential proxy so what i'm
09:29 - going to do is go here to api and
09:31 - integrations go to proxy and web
09:33 - unlocker api and then what i want to do
09:36 - is select the shared residential
09:38 - proxy right here now first i just have
09:40 - to click on other software you can use
09:42 - these proxies from you know shell node
09:45 - java all the other options they have but
09:47 - since we're going to be plugging this
09:48 - into camellio we just hit other software
09:51 - okay so we're going to go shared
09:52 - residential now what we need to do is
09:54 - pick a country and we want to make sure
09:55 - this country is going to match with the
09:57 - country we chose for the profile of our
09:59 - camellio profile so i'm going to go
10:02 - united states for the destination site
10:04 - you can leave this but it doesn't really
10:05 - matter i'm just going to make it empty
10:07 - and then for an example i mean getting
10:09 - started is fine you could use something
10:10 - else but we're just going to leave
10:12 - getting started and for root we don't
10:14 - need to actually select anything so
10:15 - really just select the type of proxy and
10:18 - then the exit node country and what it's
10:20 - going to do is actually give you all the
10:21 - information you need right here so it
10:23 - says this is the proxy this is the port
10:25 - this is the user and this is the
10:27 - password now what this proxy address
10:29 - will actually do is give you the
10:30 - rotating proxy which means your ip
10:32 - address will change every so often based
10:35 - on usage and a bunch of other factors
10:37 - that i really am not qualified to talk
10:38 - about anyways point is we now have our
10:41 - login information so we're going to use
10:42 - this right inside of camellia okay so
10:44 - i've just split the screen here so we
10:46 - can see all the information as well as
10:48 - the camillo ui so what i want to do is
10:50 - go to where it says proxy hit on http
10:53 - and then for the ip or host name i'm
10:55 - just going to copy this right here okay
10:57 - so i'm going to copy this in for the
10:58 - port we will use this port and then for
11:01 - authentication we're going to check this
11:03 - we're going to put in our username
11:05 - as well as our password so let's go
11:07 - username
11:08 - password like this
11:10 - okay paste and then hit test proxy now
11:13 - when we do that we should see that we
11:15 - get proxy works successfully loaded blah
11:17 - blah blah anyways that means we are good
11:20 - to go so what i'm going to do here is
11:21 - just check on ok and now we have
11:23 - connected the proxy to this profile okay
11:26 - so now our profile is created and we can
11:28 - go ahead and start it so i'm going to
11:30 - click on the start button and we're
11:31 - going to see this should open the chrome
11:34 - browser for us and i'm just going to
11:35 - show you that i'm actually located in
11:37 - the united states here i mean like the
11:39 - proxies united states my actual location
11:41 - is canada so when i go to you know
11:43 - what's my p or where's my location
11:46 - you're going to see that it's showing me
11:47 - in the united states even though i'm
11:49 - actually located in canada so notice
11:51 - it's not even telling me where in the
11:52 - united states it just says you are in
11:54 - the united states that is false i'm
11:56 - currently in canada now if we do
11:58 - something like what's my ip
12:00 - let's see what we're getting here this
12:01 - is the ip this is not actually my public
12:04 - ip address of course i wouldn't show
12:06 - this to you but i'm just proving to you
12:07 - that we are actually spoofing our
12:09 - location and okay here it's saying we're
12:10 - in massachusetts or close to rhode
12:12 - island or something like that anyways it
12:15 - doesn't really matter just wanted to
12:16 - show you that we are actually kind of
12:18 - spoofing the ip address and we are now
12:20 - able to use this browser as if we were
12:22 - browsing from the united states okay so
12:25 - let me close this we don't need this
12:27 - anymore
12:28 - okay so now that this is closed what i'm
12:30 - going to do is actually save this
12:32 - profile because i want to connect to
12:34 - this profile from selenium now you don't
12:37 - have to do this you can actually make a
12:39 - new pro profile from code but we are
12:41 - going to be able to load a profile in so
12:44 - what i'm going to do is go here and
12:45 - click on save as
12:47 - and i'm going to save this as just
12:49 - test.melio inside of my chameleo folder
12:51 - which is where i have all of the
12:53 - camellia code i'm going to use for this
12:55 - tutorial okay so i saved it test.camelio
12:58 - and then if i wanted to load it in so if
13:00 - i re-ran this application and i wanted
13:02 - to load this profile in again i would
13:04 - just click on browse here i would find
13:06 - the profile i would click to it and open
13:08 - it up and then i would be good to go
13:10 - now these profiles are really cool
13:12 - because they actually save cookie and
13:14 - session data as well which means if you
13:16 - say sign in to google or sign into some
13:18 - website and then you save the profile
13:21 - the next time you load it you're still
13:22 - going to be signed in so anything that
13:24 - you do in the browser it will actually
13:26 - save that's kind of the power of the
13:28 - profiles now of course you can make
13:29 - multiple profiles open profiles i'm sure
13:32 - you guys can figure that out i don't
13:33 - need to explain that anymore now what
13:35 - i'm going to do is hop over to sublime
13:37 - text and i'm going to start showing you
13:38 - how we can actually use camellio to
13:41 - automate the browser alright so now
13:43 - we're actually going to connect python
13:44 - to camellio but before we do that i
13:46 - quickly want to explain how camellio
13:48 - actually works so when you run camellio
13:51 - the graphical user interface what it
13:53 - does is it actually exposes a rest api
13:56 - now this is a local rest api and in fact
13:58 - if i go to a browser tab here and i go
14:01 - to this location you can see that we can
14:04 - actually view all of the endpoints for
14:05 - this api on our local host now the
14:08 - reason i can see this is because i'm
14:10 - currently running camellio if i wasn't
14:12 - running it i wouldn't be able to see
14:13 - this now what we're going to do is we're
14:15 - going to install the python package for
14:17 - camellio which just is a wrapper that
14:19 - interacts with the rest api so it just
14:22 - makes our life a lot easier but if you
14:23 - wanted to you could manually send http
14:26 - commands to localhost colon 5050 and
14:29 - then you could interact with camellia
14:31 - now camellio also has a package for
14:33 - nuget and for npm so if you're working
14:35 - with any net technologies or javascript
14:38 - then it's also very easy to interact
14:40 - with this rest api now the last thing i
14:42 - will mention here is that we actually
14:44 - can run this rest api without having
14:46 - this graphical user interface open now
14:49 - the way we're going to do that is we're
14:50 - going to open up our command prompt and
14:52 - we're going to type in the following
14:53 - command so i'm just going to copy in the
14:55 - path to my camellio cli tool so this is
14:58 - actually the path you guys can go to the
15:00 - appropriate path on your own machine so
15:02 - users slash whatever your username is
15:04 - where you install camilo app data local
15:07 - programs camellio and then slash and
15:10 - then you're going to run the camellio
15:11 - cli dot and then exe now this is
15:15 - actually going to run the command line
15:17 - interface for you which will expose the
15:19 - rest api and allow you to view logging
15:21 - information when you're actually
15:23 - interacting with camellia so if i hit
15:25 - enter here you're gonna see it started
15:26 - this on this port but the application
15:29 - startup failed now the reason it failed
15:30 - is because i need to pass a username and
15:32 - password for authentication when i
15:35 - actually start this so what you need to
15:37 - do is say username or actually i believe
15:38 - it's not username i believe it's email
15:41 - is equal to and then your email and then
15:43 - you say password is equal to your
15:45 - password now of course i can't show you
15:47 - my email and password so i'm going to
15:49 - type these in and run this and then i'll
15:51 - show you how it works all right so i'm
15:53 - now running the cli tool i'm just going
15:55 - to have my editors actually blur out my
15:57 - email here and my password so you guys
15:58 - don't see it but the point is i've now
16:00 - authenticated successfully by passing
16:02 - email equals and then my email and
16:04 - password equals and then my password and
16:06 - now of course if i refresh this page
16:08 - here you're going to see this still
16:10 - works because well the rest api is still
16:12 - running so now that we have this running
16:14 - from the command line interface we also
16:16 - could run it from the graphical user
16:18 - interface doesn't really matter what i'm
16:19 - going to do is install the python
16:21 - package which is called
16:23 - camellio.localapi clocked so i can just
16:25 - copy this command here pip install
16:27 - camillo local api clients i'm going to
16:29 - open up a new command prompt here so
16:31 - let's just run this like here
16:33 - i'm going to
16:35 - insert this command and hit enter now
16:37 - for some reason this pip command doesn't
16:39 - work for you you may not have pip
16:41 - installed in your system path i will
16:42 - leave two videos on the screen that show
16:44 - you how to fix that you also can just
16:46 - try doing the following
16:48 - python and then hyphen m pip install and
16:52 - the camellio.local api client anyways
16:55 - i'm assuming that you guys know how to
16:56 - do that but i just want to show that in
16:58 - case okay so now that we have this
17:00 - installed what we can actually do is
17:01 - finally go to our python code and we can
17:04 - start actually connecting with camellia
17:06 - alright so now i'm actually inside of
17:07 - the code that i showed you at the very
17:09 - beginning of the video that wasn't
17:11 - working and didn't allow us to sign into
17:13 - google what we're going to do is simply
17:15 - refactor this using camellio and getting
17:18 - a web driver from our camellio profile
17:21 - now we're actually going to start by
17:22 - creating a brand new profile from code
17:25 - then i'll show you how to load and save
17:27 - profiles so i'm not really going to
17:28 - explain all of this code here this is
17:30 - just regular selenium code this is not a
17:33 - tutorial on selenium but if you do want
17:35 - to learn selenium and understand how all
17:37 - of this works then what you can do is go
17:39 - to the series that i have on selenium i
17:42 - will put it on the screen and leave it
17:43 - in the description i will also leave all
17:45 - of this code on github and i'll link to
17:47 - that in the description as well as the
17:49 - documentation for camellio in case you
17:51 - get confused when we go through this
17:54 - anyways now that we have camellio
17:55 - installed what i want to do is go up
17:58 - here and start importing some stuff from
17:59 - camellio that we need so as a reminder
18:02 - what we're going to do here is start by
18:03 - creating a new profile from code and
18:06 - then we're going to load that profile
18:08 - use it get access to its web driver and
18:10 - you're going to see that what we had
18:12 - before that wasn't working now hopefully
18:14 - should be working all right so the first
18:15 - thing we're going to do is say from and
18:17 - then this is going to be camellio and
18:20 - dot local underscore api underscore
18:23 - client dot and then local api client
18:26 - again we're going to import the camellio
18:29 - and then this is going to be the local
18:30 - api client now after that we're going to
18:33 - say from
18:34 - camellio this will be dot local api
18:37 - client again except this time it's going
18:39 - to be builder underscore four underscore
18:42 - create underscore
18:45 - profile like that and then we're going
18:47 - to import the
18:49 - builder for create profile now let me
18:52 - just look at my cheat sheet here to make
18:53 - sure this is correct
18:55 - looks good i believe that's all we need
18:56 - for right now so now that we have both
18:58 - of those what i'm going to do is
19:00 - actually remove my web driver here
19:02 - because i no longer need to use the
19:04 - selenium webdriver i'm going to use the
19:06 - camellia webdriver so i'm going to start
19:08 - by defining the base url of the rest api
19:11 - for camellio so i'm going to say
19:13 - camellio and then this will be
19:14 - underscore base underscore url is equal
19:18 - to and then this is going to be
19:19 - localhost colon5050 like that that is
19:22 - where camellio is hosted currently and
19:24 - you need to have camellia running either
19:26 - the cli or the graphical user interface
19:29 - for this to actually work so keep that
19:31 - in mind you need it running in the
19:32 - background otherwise this will not work
19:34 - again either the graphical user
19:35 - interface or the cli so now that i have
19:37 - this what i'm going to do is say my
19:39 - client is equal to and then this is
19:40 - going to be the camellio local api
19:42 - client and i'm going to pass to this the
19:44 - camellio base url and then this should
19:47 - initialize camellia so now i have
19:48 - clients and what i can do is actually
19:50 - search for a base profile and then
19:53 - create a new instance of that base
19:55 - profile so all of this documentation
19:57 - will be linked in the description what
19:59 - i'm going to say is my base underscore
20:01 - profiles is equal to client dot and then
20:03 - this is going to be search and i believe
20:05 - this is base profiles we're going to say
20:07 - base underscore profiles like that what
20:10 - this is going to do is look through the
20:11 - base default profiles the one that we
20:14 - saw on camillo in the graphical user
20:16 - interface and we're going to search for
20:18 - ones that meet some specific criteria
20:20 - sort so what we want here is the device
20:23 - underscore type
20:25 - to be equal to and then this is going to
20:27 - be a desktop like that this is actually
20:29 - going to be lowercase and then for the
20:32 - browser i believe we just say browser
20:34 - like that underscore product actually is
20:37 - going to be equal to and then just
20:39 - chrome so this is going to give us the
20:40 - result for all of the base profiles that
20:43 - have a device of desktop and the product
20:46 - of chrome now for me to have this be
20:48 - valid i just need to add in these right
20:50 - here okay so now we should have access
20:52 - to all of the base profiles and what i
20:54 - want to do is create a new profile based
20:56 - on this base profile or based on one of
20:58 - these base profiles all right so on the
21:00 - next line down i'm going to say the
21:02 - create underscore profile
21:04 - underscore request if we could type this
21:07 - properly is equal to builder for create
21:10 - profile i'm going to do a backslash then
21:12 - dot and this is going to be i guess base
21:16 - or from underscore base underscore
21:19 - profile okay then we're going to pass
21:21 - the base profiles at index 0 dot id the
21:26 - idea here is that this is going to give
21:27 - us a list of profiles all of them that
21:29 - match this criteria there's some other
21:31 - keywords you can pass again i'll leave
21:32 - the documentation in the description
21:34 - anyways we don't really care we just
21:35 - want to get any of them to match this
21:37 - criteria so we'll get the very first one
21:39 - we'll get the id of it and we'll pass
21:41 - that to here for the builder for create
21:44 - profile anyways after this i'm going to
21:46 - do a backslash i'm going to say dot and
21:48 - this is going to be set underscore
21:50 - recommended and then not features but
21:53 - this is actually going to be defaults
21:55 - like that then we're going to do a
21:57 - backslash again and then say dot build
22:00 - okay
22:01 - next we are going to say the profile is
22:03 - equal to and this is going to be client
22:05 - dot and i believe this is just create
22:07 - profile and we're going to pass as the
22:10 - body here the create profile request
22:14 - so what this is going to be here is
22:15 - actually the request for the profile
22:17 - that we want to create we then need to
22:19 - send that request by calling create
22:22 - profile so create profile is actually
22:23 - going to call the rest api that's
22:26 - running it's going to create the profile
22:28 - then it's going to return it to us
22:29 - inside of this profile variable we don't
22:31 - really need to understand how all of
22:33 - this works because we have this nice
22:34 - wrapper that we can use but that's kind
22:36 - of what this is doing okay let me just
22:38 - look at my cheat sheet make sure i
22:39 - didn't mess anything up looks like we
22:42 - are all good for right now and now that
22:44 - we have created the profile the next
22:46 - thing that i want to do is actually get
22:48 - access to the web driver from the
22:50 - profile so i'm going to start by saying
22:52 - options is equal to webdriver
22:54 - dot and then this is going to be
22:57 - chrome
22:58 - options like this
23:00 - now if you want to find where i'm using
23:01 - this web driver i'm just importing it
23:03 - from selenium so of course you're going
23:05 - to need selenium installed as well to
23:07 - follow along with this i kind of assume
23:08 - at this point you all have selenium
23:10 - otherwise i'm not sure why you'd be
23:12 - watching this tutorial anyways we're
23:14 - going to have options equal to
23:15 - webdriver.chrome options then what we're
23:18 - going to do is say options.add and this
23:20 - is going to be underscore experimental
23:22 - underscore option and we're going to say
23:25 - inside of here that the camellio colon
23:28 - and then this is going to be profile id
23:31 - comma and we're going to pass the
23:33 - profile dot id so a little bit strange
23:35 - but we're just pretty much telling this
23:37 - web driver to use camillo so we're
23:39 - saying camilo profile id when we pass
23:42 - the profile d that will be substituted
23:44 - in here and well then we'll have the
23:46 - correct web driver options now what
23:48 - we're going to do
23:49 - is say driver is equal to webdriver dot
23:52 - and then remote and what we're going to
23:54 - do is make our command x
23:57 - executor so let's say command
23:59 - executor like that equal to and then
24:01 - this is going to be fstring inside of
24:03 - here we're going to say camellio and
24:05 - then this is going to be the underscore
24:07 - base underscore url slash and then web
24:10 - driver and then we're going to say the
24:12 - options
24:13 - is equal to options of course we need a
24:16 - comma and i don't think we need
24:17 - backslashes actually i think this is
24:19 - good okay so there we go obviously i
24:21 - don't have all of this memorized i'm
24:23 - just reading this right from the
24:24 - camellia documentation again i'm going
24:26 - to keep saying it is in the description
24:28 - okay so let's just run through what we
24:29 - did here because i understand this is a
24:31 - lot of code
24:32 - so what we did is define the base url of
24:34 - camellio just where it's running like
24:36 - the local api right so it's running on
24:38 - localhost port 5050. then we are
24:40 - creating a client pretty straightforward
24:42 - remember we imported these two things
24:44 - right here next we're saying the base
24:46 - profiles is equal to client.search based
24:49 - profiles we're searching for the device
24:50 - type of desktop and the browser product
24:53 - of chrome we could also search by
24:54 - language
24:55 - and by i believe operating system as
24:58 - well
24:59 - anyways we then have create profile
25:00 - request so we're saying builder for
25:02 - create profile dot from base profile
25:04 - base profile zero so just getting the
25:06 - first one and the id of it we're setting
25:08 - the recommended defaults and then
25:10 - building this request then we're going
25:12 - to say profile is equal to
25:13 - client.gradeprofile
25:15 - pass in the body here which is going to
25:16 - be the request
25:18 - this will then give us the profile now
25:20 - that the profile is created what we need
25:22 - to do is make a web driver that uses
25:24 - this profile so this here webdriver
25:26 - again this is coming right from selenium
25:28 - so we're saying options webdriver.com
25:30 - options we're going to add an
25:32 - experimental option this is going to
25:33 - tell the web driver to use camellio then
25:36 - when we run the webdriver we're going to
25:38 - set webdriver.remote
25:39 - we're going to pass the command executor
25:41 - as the base url so our kind of local
25:44 - host api client slash webdriver and then
25:47 - the options equal to the options this
25:49 - will then return to us an actual web
25:51 - driver that uses camellio so now i don't
25:54 - need to mess with the rest of my code at
25:56 - all because it's using a variable called
25:58 - driver so now i'm just going to be using
26:00 - my regular web driver here from camellia
26:04 - hopefully that makes sense but at this
26:06 - point in time that's really all you need
26:07 - to know to use a camilo profile now just
26:10 - use this driver object here as your web
26:12 - driver and you will have your browser
26:14 - fingerprint changed and you shouldn't be
26:16 - detected as a bot alright so i was about
26:18 - to just run the code but after reading
26:20 - through this quickly i realized there's
26:21 - a few minor mistakes so let's just go
26:23 - ahead and fix those quickly so first
26:25 - we're going to go to our import
26:26 - statement here and notice how i was kind
26:28 - of thrown off that these were the same
26:29 - name so local api client twice well they
26:32 - actually aren't i just read it
26:33 - incorrectly this is going to be camellio
26:35 - and then underscore local api client so
26:37 - make that change in the first import
26:39 - statement my apologies also we need to
26:41 - change this from all capital on api to a
26:44 - lower case for p and i which means we
26:47 - also need to change that here
26:49 - another error that we had is i had from
26:51 - base profile here this is actually going
26:53 - to be for base profile so let's fix that
26:56 - and one thing that i forgot to do was
26:58 - start my profile
27:00 - so after we create the profile it's not
27:01 - yet started i actually need to start it
27:04 - and the way i start it is client dot and
27:06 - then start underscore profile and i just
27:08 - pass the profile
27:10 - dot id like this okay we should be good
27:13 - to go now again my apologies on those
27:15 - mistakes but that's what happens when
27:16 - you're programming now fingers crossed
27:19 - let's run the code and see if this works
27:22 - all right so we can see that we have
27:23 - loaded up aliexpress here we should
27:25 - hopefully close the pop-up it's going to
27:28 - click on the join button sign in with
27:30 - google it's going to bring us to this
27:31 - page we're going to enter our
27:33 - information here and we should be good
27:37 - to go here once this closes let's see
27:40 - all right so we are now back on alibaba
27:42 - it searches for rtx 3060s which is what
27:45 - i have the script actually doing and
27:47 - then notice it shows us all of these
27:49 - options okay so let's make this larger
27:51 - here and there we go we are good to go
27:53 - so that is how this works right using
27:55 - camellia we were able to sign in whereas
27:57 - when we were using just regular selenium
27:59 - it didn't allow us to do so so that's as
28:02 - easy as it is to get started with uh
28:04 - camellio now what i want to show you how
28:06 - to do is how to save a profile and how
28:08 - to load a profile because a lot of times
28:11 - as soon as you kind of do all of this
28:12 - tedious stuff signing in whatever you
28:14 - want to save your browser information
28:16 - your cookies all of that data and then
28:18 - load that in another time so let's go
28:20 - ahead and do that all right so i've just
28:22 - pulled up the documentation for actually
28:24 - saving the profile for camellio now what
28:27 - i'm going to do is just copy in some of
28:28 - the stuff here to save us a bit of time
28:30 - so we need this import right here to
28:32 - save the profile notice there's a save
28:34 - profile request so i'm going to copy
28:36 - that in we'll put that at the top of our
28:38 - code right here
28:40 - let's go back to this which is right
28:42 - here and we can see that to save the
28:43 - profile we first need to actually stop
28:46 - it which is something that i haven't
28:47 - done yet so we'll look at that in a
28:49 - second then we're going to grab the path
28:51 - where we want to save the profile to and
28:53 - we're going to use the save profile
28:54 - request so let me just copy all this and
28:56 - then we'll kind of walk through this
28:57 - step by step so after all of our stuff
29:00 - is done here
29:01 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to
29:02 - stop my profile now my profile is stored
29:04 - in profile so it's fine to say
29:06 - client.profile and then stop the profile
29:08 - id then what we need to do here is
29:11 - actually generate the path where we want
29:13 - to save this file to
29:15 - now this involves me importing os
29:18 - so let's do this actually os is already
29:20 - imported so i don't need to do that
29:22 - anyways we have os imported so this is
29:24 - going to get the directory name and the
29:26 - path of where the current file is and
29:29 - then we're going to save this as test2
29:31 - dot camellio because we have test
29:33 - already saved in this directory anyways
29:36 - then we're going to say result is equal
29:37 - to client.save profile pass the profile
29:40 - id we want to save and the save profile
29:42 - request which just takes in the path and
29:44 - says where on our system we want to save
29:47 - this then what this does just print out
29:49 - profile has been saved to and then the
29:50 - result of here dot last known path so we
29:53 - can run this one more time and actually
29:56 - while i run this this time i want to
29:57 - open up the cli and show you that we're
30:00 - actually going to see kind of the logs
30:01 - and information happening here while
30:03 - this runs so let's just split this on
30:05 - the screen i didn't mean to minimize
30:07 - that let's turn this over here so as
30:09 - this runs you're going to see you know
30:10 - information occurs on here it says
30:12 - profile with id has been started
30:14 - successful received web driver
30:16 - connection and then as soon as we save
30:18 - and uh i guess stop the profile you're
30:21 - gonna see that in here as well okay so
30:23 - let's give it a second this part takes a
30:25 - few seconds to run all right so we can
30:27 - see here that the profile with id has
30:29 - been stopped successfully and then
30:31 - profile with id has been saved what i
30:34 - will do is open up my windows explorer
30:36 - and show you this file alright so i now
30:38 - have my windows explorer open notice i
30:40 - have a bunch of files inside of here and
30:41 - while test2 was just saved at this time
30:44 - when i'm actually recording video
30:46 - anyways what i'm going to do now is show
30:47 - you how we can load a profile so rather
30:50 - than having to go through all these
30:51 - steps of actually creating a profile
30:53 - from a base profile we're just going to
30:55 - load a profile from a file let's do that
30:58 - now so again i've just opened up the
31:00 - camellio documentation we can just copy
31:02 - and paste a few things in here so i'm
31:04 - going to copy in the load profile
31:06 - request import statement so let's put
31:08 - that up here before i copy anything else
31:10 - let me just delete a few things here so
31:12 - i don't need to create a profile i don't
31:14 - need to search the base profiles so i
31:16 - can get rid of all of this and for now
31:18 - i'm just going to say profile is equal
31:20 - to none and then we're going to load it
31:21 - in in a minute now i also don't want to
31:23 - save this profile anymore so i'm going
31:25 - to get rid of all of this right here
31:28 - okay but we will stop the profile so now
31:32 - let's go back to our documentation which
31:34 - is right here and let's find where we
31:36 - load in a profile looks like we do it
31:38 - right here so we're going to say profile
31:39 - is equal to client dot load profile
31:42 - turns out we're actually going to need
31:43 - this path so i'll copy that in in a
31:45 - second so i'm going to say profile is
31:47 - equal to this
31:48 - start profile that's fine we can start
31:50 - the profile and i need to copy in this
31:53 - path variable right here
31:55 - okay so let's do this
31:57 - we're going to say path is equal to this
31:59 - this time i'm going to access the test
32:01 - profile the reason for that is i want to
32:02 - access the profile that we created at
32:04 - the beginning of the video that's
32:05 - connected to the proxy then i'm going to
32:07 - say profile is equal to client.load
32:10 - profile the body will be equal to load
32:12 - profile request we'll pass the path
32:14 - which we defined right here and then i'm
32:16 - going to say client dot start profile
32:18 - we're going to get the web driver and
32:19 - we're going to do everything we did
32:21 - before pretty straightforward let's go
32:23 - ahead and run this and see if this works
32:26 - alright so i've just split the windows
32:28 - here so we have both the cli tool as
32:30 - well as the web browser now i'm gonna
32:32 - let the program run through here and
32:33 - then i'll confirm with you if it's
32:35 - successful or not in a second all right
32:37 - so we've just got past the google
32:39 - sign-in now it's actually closing this
32:41 - page as we know this takes a while so
32:44 - once this is done loading and it
32:45 - redirects us then i will be right back
32:47 - okay so it's redirected us back just
32:49 - searched for rtx 3060
32:51 - looks like it has been successful
32:54 - let's make this larger we can see we're
32:55 - seeing some different graphics cards
32:57 - then of course the program is going to
32:58 - close because now we are finished
33:01 - anyways that is how you actually load a
33:03 - profile and then execute that with
33:05 - camellia now the last thing i want to
33:07 - show you here is that if we actually go
33:09 - to the camellio user interface we're
33:11 - going to see that all of the profiles
33:13 - we've created and loaded as we've been
33:15 - kind of doing this from code are
33:17 - actually going to show up on our ui so
33:19 - notice we have all of these different
33:21 - profiles here a bunch of them we created
33:23 - from the base profiles when we were
33:26 - originally kind of testing and running
33:27 - this application then we have
33:29 - test.camelia which we've loaded in right
33:32 - and then we have a bunch of other
33:33 - unsaved profiles and test2.camelio
33:35 - which we actually manually saved from
33:38 - the code so i just wanted to show you
33:39 - that they show up in the user interface
33:41 - as well all right so now that we've
33:43 - looked at that example the last thing i
33:45 - want to show you how to do is how to
33:46 - connect to a proxy from code so i showed
33:49 - you previously that we can load up the
33:51 - graphical user interface create a new
33:53 - profile and then connect to the proxy
33:55 - however that means we had to load the
33:57 - profile like this to be able to actually
33:59 - use it so sometimes instead you want to
34:01 - make a new profile from code and then
34:04 - directly add the proxy so i'm going to
34:06 - show you how to do that now we're going
34:07 - to use camillo obviously you can connect
34:09 - to a proxy with selenium however you're
34:12 - severely limited because you can't pass
34:14 - authentication information so you can't
34:16 - pass an email you can't pass a password
34:18 - and so it makes it pretty useless if you
34:20 - have an authenticated proxy like we do
34:23 - anyways let's go ahead and get into this
34:25 - so what i'm going to do is open up this
34:27 - documentation here and what i need to do
34:29 - now is create a new profile so i'm just
34:30 - going to copy this we've already seen
34:32 - this here we have base profiles great
34:34 - profile request and then profile i'm
34:36 - going to copy all of this in and simply
34:38 - replace these two lines right here
34:41 - okay so now rather than loading a
34:42 - profile we're going to be creating a new
34:44 - one again we've already seen how to do
34:46 - this the only difference is now we have
34:48 - this dot set proxy method now notice
34:51 - here we're using server so we're setting
34:52 - up the proxy server so i need to import
34:55 - this which i'm going to get from right
34:56 - here so i'm going to steal this import
34:58 - from camillo.localapi
35:01 - models dot server underscore pi three
35:04 - import serv again this documentation
35:06 - will be linked in the description you
35:07 - can very easily find that example
35:09 - anyways we now have this imported so
35:11 - this should all work and what we can do
35:13 - here is connect all different types of
35:14 - proxies so we can connect to a sox5
35:16 - proxy http or https now the proxy that
35:20 - i'm going to use is from bright data and
35:22 - this is going to be http
35:24 - so what i'm going to do now is go to
35:26 - bright data which is right here i'm
35:28 - going to copy in this information into
35:30 - these fields and then i will be right
35:32 - back all right so i've now filled in all
35:34 - my proxy credentials you can see i have
35:36 - my secret my id my port and my host and
35:39 - now i should actually be good to just
35:41 - run this code and see if this works
35:44 - again the only change we've made to
35:45 - connect to a proxy is we've just called
35:47 - dot set proxy make sure you do this
35:49 - import though because you need to import
35:50 - server we then define server we put the
35:53 - type of the proxy and we passed all of
35:55 - our credentials and a login information
35:57 - for the proxy okay so i should be good
35:59 - to run this i'm going to go ahead and
36:01 - run once this is loaded i will show you
36:03 - if it is working or not alright so it
36:05 - looks like the web driver has loaded you
36:07 - can see it's open in front of me right
36:09 - now now i'm going to let it run through
36:10 - this script and then once it's finished
36:12 - i will confirm with you that it is
36:14 - indeed working okay so it has now
36:15 - redirected us back to aliexpress we got
36:18 - through the google sign-in and we can
36:19 - see that it has searched for rtx 3060
36:22 - and everything is all good
36:24 - okay it actually closes that because now
36:26 - we are finished with the program and
36:28 - there you go we have now completed
36:30 - connecting to a proxy from code all
36:32 - right so with that said i'm pretty much
36:34 - going to wrap up the video here there's
36:36 - not really much more that i can mention
36:38 - another massive thank you to camellio
36:40 - for sponsoring this video and i hope
36:41 - this helps you guys get past some
36:43 - selenium restrictions with that said if
36:45 - you enjoyed make sure to leave a like
36:46 - subscribe to the channel and i will see
36:48 - you in another one
