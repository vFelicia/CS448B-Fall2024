00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back in this
00:02 - video I'm gonna be sharing with you five
00:04 - ways that you can make money programming
00:06 - without getting the job now this is
00:08 - important because I know a lot of people
00:10 - watching probably aren't able to get a
00:11 - job right now it's very difficult with
00:13 - all the Kovan stuff going on you might
00:16 - not be able to get one locally maybe you
00:17 - don't have enough experience maybe
00:19 - you're only 10 or 11 years old that
00:21 - doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to
00:22 - use your programming ability to make
00:24 - money on the side and I can tell you
00:26 - that the five methods I'm going to show
00:28 - you here have made me a tremendous
00:29 - amount of money over the years that I've
00:31 - been doing them I started as early as 16
00:34 - or 17 and now I'm still doing all of
00:36 - these methods while even working a job
00:38 - and they make me much more money than my
00:40 - full-time job does so with that being
00:43 - said let's go ahead and get started and
00:44 - talk about five ways that you can make
00:46 - money programming without getting a job
00:51 - [Music]
00:55 - so this first method is probably the
00:58 - most obvious and the most talked about
01:00 - in terms of making money without getting
01:01 - a job and that is simply freelancing and
01:04 - the reason I'm bringing this up is
01:05 - because freelancing is such a great
01:07 - opportunity to take whatever skillset
01:09 - you have and be able to actually get
01:11 - paid to do that get paid to use those
01:14 - skills it doesn't really matter what
01:16 - you're good at if you're good at one
01:17 - specific thing there's probably someone
01:19 - that's willing to pay you to do that
01:21 - thing I'll give you an example of how I
01:23 - got started with freelancing but it
01:25 - doesn't matter how good you are to
01:26 - freelance just please don't go in with
01:28 - the misconception that you need to be a
01:30 - pro web designer or you need to be
01:32 - really good at making games you need to
01:33 - be really good at scripting and writing
01:35 - algorithms that does not matter
01:37 - whatsoever in fact if you're actually
01:40 - someone who's kind of lower cost you
01:41 - don't have a ton of experience you might
01:43 - actually even get more clients because
01:45 - people want the cheaper price for what
01:47 - you're able to do so what I will say is
01:49 - that you can freelance doing literally
01:51 - anything you want you can build a
01:53 - website for 20 grand for a company or
01:55 - you can make a little script and finish
01:57 - someone's homework for five dollars
01:59 - right it doesn't matter what skill you
02:01 - have if you know how to program in any
02:03 - capacity so long as you can market that
02:05 - skill correctly you'll be able to get
02:07 - clients and you'll be able to make money
02:09 - doing this so I'm gonna give you a very
02:10 - real example of how I did this and how I
02:13 - made my first
02:13 - thousand dollars on fiver as a
02:16 - freelancer so what I did was I was 17 I
02:19 - was just in my first year of university
02:21 - I was pretty good at Python coding and I
02:23 - was good at making 2d games with the
02:26 - module called PI game just a stupid
02:28 - little module you can make 2d graphical
02:30 - games in Python I'd made a few before so
02:33 - I went on Fiverr I set up an account and
02:35 - I posted a listing or it's called a gig
02:37 - that pretty much described what I would
02:39 - do and I said hey I will make a 2-d game
02:41 - for you in Python and I started my
02:44 - pricing and I think like $15 for a
02:46 - really simple game with no animation
02:48 - then I think I went up and I said okay
02:50 - if you want animation and you want
02:51 - sprites and all of that then we'll make
02:53 - it 40 if you want to game this much more
02:55 - advanced than what I usually do I'll
02:57 - charge you 75 or something like that
02:58 - right and I posted that ad I did not pay
03:01 - anything for it I just posted the
03:03 - listing on Fiverr and I just let it suck
03:05 - I just let it sit there and pretty much
03:07 - every week I had someone reaching out to
03:09 - me on Fiverr and saying hey I saw your
03:11 - ad can you you know finish this for me
03:13 - oh I'm working on a game can you help me
03:15 - with this hey you know I need you to
03:17 - create this for me oh I want my daughter
03:18 - to play this cool game whatever it may
03:20 - be right I got all kinds of random
03:22 - things that I never thought I would even
03:23 - receive I just posted there to see what
03:25 - I could even do on Fiverr and while I
03:28 - was able to start making money and the
03:29 - great thing is once you get more reviews
03:31 - you start building things you start to
03:33 - understand how long it takes you to make
03:35 - something how much effort is gonna go
03:36 - into it and you can adjust your pricing
03:38 - accordingly and usually start rising
03:40 - that price as you kind of establish
03:43 - yourself on one of these freelancing
03:44 - websites so that's what I did I just
03:46 - made 2d games for people with Python had
03:48 - very little experience no one really
03:50 - know who I was I didn't have any search
03:52 - engine optimization or anything like
03:54 - that and I was able to make over a
03:55 - thousand dollars in about two months
03:57 - just by doing them so that's a very real
04:00 - example I'm no different than you if I
04:02 - can do that you can do that just pick
04:04 - what you're good at list it on Fiverr
04:06 - listed on some other website and wait
04:08 - for people to message you and there you
04:10 - go you'll get some clients and you will
04:11 - to start making money freelancing and of
04:13 - course if you're way better than I am
04:15 - you can definitely make a lot more and
04:17 - post some more advanced ads and do
04:19 - things like web development and all of
04:20 - that so the next method I have for you
04:22 - guys is tutoring now this is one of my
04:24 - personal favorites this is how I really
04:26 - got started even just with
04:27 - this YouTube channel and it's something
04:29 - that's also really rewarding to see the
04:31 - person you're tutoring actually get
04:33 - better and improve and improve their
04:35 - grades in whatever class they're working
04:36 - towards or even just in their own
04:38 - personal projects whatever it may be
04:40 - now I've tutored you know tens of
04:42 - different people some have been easier
04:44 - than others something more challenging
04:46 - I've charged lots of different rates
04:47 - depending on what I'm doing but it just
04:49 - really is a great way to make money and
04:51 - the nice thing is that it doesn't matter
04:52 - how old you are you can definitely be a
04:54 - tutor I started tutoring when I was
04:57 - fifteen years old and I think that was
04:58 - probably when I was in grade 10 or grade
05:00 - 11 and I was tutoring and tutoring
05:02 - someone in grade 9 just teaching them
05:04 - really basic programming stuff right I
05:06 - was making like $20 an hour it was
05:08 - really easy for me I stayed an hour
05:10 - after school and I tutored the kid II
05:12 - went to my my high school right it's as
05:14 - easy as that and I even went to my
05:16 - computer science teacher and I said hey
05:18 - you know I'm starting to tutor if you
05:20 - have any kids that are struggling you
05:21 - know I'm available here's my number you
05:23 - can refer them to me and sure enough he
05:25 - did he liked me I'd been in his class
05:27 - before and that's how I picked up a
05:28 - bunch of clients as well then once you
05:31 - pick up some clients word-of-mouth is
05:32 - really powerful if you're a good tutor
05:34 - and you're doing a good job and of
05:36 - course you can go online and you can
05:37 - even sign up on Fiverr and be a tutor
05:39 - you can sign up on other websites and be
05:41 - a tutor it's just something that's
05:42 - really easy and if you actually get
05:44 - better at it and start teaching some
05:46 - more advanced concepts you can make a
05:48 - lot of money personally when I tutor now
05:50 - I charge well over $150 an hour which
05:53 - might seem absurd to a bunch of you but
05:55 - if people are willing to pay that amount
05:56 - they're willing to pay that amount right
05:58 - and that's because of the social media
06:00 - presence that I have and the skill that
06:02 - I can kind of display that I have
06:04 - tutoring but I'm just trying to show you
06:05 - that you can make a lot of money doing
06:07 - it and imagine I was tutoring five
06:08 - people a day at $150 an hour right
06:11 - that's a lot of math that you're doing
06:13 - my head but that's like eight hundred
06:14 - dollars a day or something like that
06:15 - right you can make a good amount of
06:17 - money doing it and I would highly
06:19 - recommend you at least consider it
06:20 - because it really is a great way to use
06:23 - your programming skills and make money
06:24 - from it
06:25 - so the next method I have for you guys
06:26 - is one I'm very familiar with and this
06:28 - is simply sharing your knowledge online
06:30 - now you can do this in any capacity this
06:33 - could be a YouTube video this could be
06:35 - an article this could be a blog post
06:36 - this could be a website this could be
06:38 - Twitter this can be insert
06:40 - and this could be LinkedIn it does not
06:42 - matter how you share your knowledge in
06:44 - what form you do it but please do
06:46 - because if you don't you are missing out
06:48 - on a tremendous opportunity or
06:50 - tremendous opportunities now what I mean
06:52 - by this is not that I'm trying to tell
06:55 - you that you're gonna make a ton of
06:56 - money by hosting ads on your blog or
06:58 - hosting ads on your YouTube channel the
07:00 - reality is to make any money from ads
07:02 - you have to have hundreds of thousands
07:05 - of people following you or hundreds of
07:06 - thousands of people watching and
07:08 - engaging with your content even back
07:11 - when I was like ten twenty thousand
07:12 - subscribers I wasn't even making a
07:14 - thousand dollars a month from YouTube ad
07:15 - revenue right so it's not a great way
07:18 - for me to tell you to make money is by
07:19 - hosting ads on certain sites what I am
07:22 - trying to tell you to do though is share
07:24 - your knowledge because when you do that
07:25 - you open people up to seeing you to
07:28 - finding you on the Internet and if you
07:30 - can have some kind of presence where
07:32 - someone even if it's once a month finds
07:34 - out who you are sees your content and
07:36 - maybe decides to email you or ask you a
07:39 - question you've now just potentially
07:41 - built a new connection or potentially
07:43 - gained a new clients or gained some new
07:45 - work what I mean is like I had a YouTube
07:48 - channel huh you know three years ago
07:50 - right the same YouTube channel and like
07:52 - 50 subscribers even then with the 20
07:54 - videos I had posted people would reach
07:56 - out to me and say hey I saw you were
07:58 - pretty good at Python because you had
08:00 - those videos can you tutor my son in
08:02 - Python he's really struggling here or
08:03 - hey you know I saw you were working on
08:05 - this turtle project I need some help
08:07 - with this program would you mind I'll
08:08 - give you 10 bucks for it right that is
08:10 - what I'm talking about those are the
08:11 - opportunities that you would never be
08:13 - able to get unless you had some kind of
08:15 - presence online and some way for people
08:17 - to find you in contact you so that's
08:19 - what this method is all about not
08:21 - directly making money from the source of
08:23 - sharing information but making money
08:25 - from people finding you because of that
08:27 - information and contacting you to do
08:30 - things for them I can tell you I've
08:32 - received countless job offers countless
08:34 - freelance work whatever you want I've
08:37 - had an email to me about it
08:39 - and I usually have to turn them down I
08:41 - cannot tell you oh it's got to be
08:43 - probably close to a hundred people at
08:44 - this point I've asked me to be their
08:46 - business partners right have asked me
08:47 - hey I'll give you 50% share in this
08:49 - company you don't even have to invest I
08:50 - just want your Python knowledge you're
08:52 - gonna help me make this website right
08:53 - that's
08:54 - example of the opportunity you have
08:56 - access to when you are accessible online
08:58 - and people can find you through some
09:00 - kind of knowledge that you're sharing of
09:02 - course you can do other things online
09:03 - but building some kind of presence is
09:05 - really important and I think it's just
09:07 - gonna continue to get more important as
09:08 - the years go on so the next method here
09:11 - is probably the most difficult on this
09:12 - list but also probably the most
09:14 - lucrative if you're able to actually
09:15 - make this work now this is going to be
09:17 - to start a business or to build some
09:19 - kind of product or service that you can
09:21 - sell now the best examples I can give
09:23 - this is you know look at Facebook look
09:25 - at Google look at a lot of these large
09:26 - tech companies most of them started
09:29 - because one person or a small team of
09:30 - people decided hey I'm good at
09:32 - programming I want to build this I think
09:34 - it would sell and I think people would
09:36 - use it that's all really is right look
09:38 - at a lot of the apps you use today look
09:40 - at a lot of the products you use a lot
09:42 - of these things were not started
09:44 - especially in tech to be these massive
09:46 - huge businesses a lot of them were
09:48 - started because someone wanted to build
09:50 - something cooler they wanted to start
09:52 - their own business or build a product
09:53 - with the skills that they have now of
09:55 - course this is very challenging not only
09:58 - do you have to be good at program and
09:59 - you have to understand business if you
10:00 - want to make any money doing something
10:01 - like this but the great thing with
10:04 - programming is that you are
10:05 - automatically just an entrepreneur you
10:07 - can build whatever you want and go ahead
10:09 - and sell it you can make some crappy
10:11 - little app on the App Store take flappy
10:14 - bird for example and immediately become
10:16 - a millionaire overnight now of course
10:17 - that's an exception is that gonna happen
10:19 - probably not what I'm trying to say is
10:21 - that if you have a good idea or you have
10:23 - something that you want to build just
10:25 - build it and then try to sell it right
10:27 - put it on the App Store run some ads on
10:29 - it charge a buck for it
10:31 - make some service that maybe you can
10:32 - sell to a company or something like that
10:34 - right this obviously is easier said than
10:37 - done but something I think a lot of
10:38 - people just forget that it even even is
10:41 - possible right if you know how to
10:43 - program immediately you can become a
10:45 - business owner because you can just make
10:46 - your own business you don't have to have
10:48 - any capital you don't have to have a ton
10:50 - of skills maybe you have to host a
10:52 - website okay maybe that cost you like 50
10:53 - bucks a month or something but still you
10:56 - have the skills already to be able to
10:58 - start a business and something
10:59 - successful that you can do by yourself
11:01 - so that's my point for number four
11:03 - unfortunately there's not too much to
11:04 - talk about there but that is another
11:06 - great option and if
11:07 - course a way that you can make money
11:09 - with programming without getting a job
11:11 - so this last one is personally one of my
11:13 - favorites it ones it's one that gets me
11:15 - really excited especially when I hear
11:16 - people are actually doing it and having
11:18 - success with it and if you are please do
11:20 - leave a comment down below cuz I would
11:22 - love to hear about your experience but
11:23 - it is helping local businesses by
11:26 - providing technological solutions
11:28 - providing some kind of coding or
11:29 - automated solution what I mean by this
11:31 - is essentially going to some local
11:33 - business some small shops someplace that
11:35 - the owners probably aren't very
11:36 - technologically advanced right they
11:38 - probably don't know how to set up a
11:39 - website or they probably wouldn't even
11:41 - go ahead and seek that assistance right
11:43 - going to one of those places identifying
11:45 - a problem and then pitching a solution
11:47 - for it now the most classic example is
11:50 - like going to a really small shop and
11:52 - saying hey I notice you don't have a
11:54 - website it's 20/20 you need a website
11:56 - this is an example of all of your
11:58 - competitors websites I can make you one
12:01 - that looks way better than those and
12:02 - that's gonna drive so many more so much
12:04 - more traffic to your place right we're
12:06 - gonna make sure it ranks on Google we're
12:08 - gonna make sure that that shows up and
12:09 - then when you want to direct people you
12:11 - can say hey you can check out my website
12:12 - right that's a really good example of
12:14 - something that you could do another
12:16 - thing can be as simple as going to
12:18 - alchemy an example of something I did so
12:20 - I worked at a summer camp this is a job
12:22 - but still this is something you could
12:23 - totally do and I realized that in the
12:25 - office they were having a really hard
12:28 - time actually picking the schedules for
12:30 - all of the groups that we had at the
12:32 - summer camp
12:32 - so it was a bunch of sports they were
12:33 - participating in essentially like no two
12:35 - groups could play at the same time so I
12:37 - told I was like hey you know have a few
12:38 - spare hours you want me to whip up a
12:40 - little program for you that automates
12:42 - this scheduling process because they
12:44 - were manually going through and for nine
12:45 - or ten groups deciding okay you have to
12:48 - have this here oh you know you're having
12:49 - lunch here and then they'd have to go
12:51 - through manually look at all the
12:53 - schedules and make sure nothing
12:54 - conflicted so I said do you want me to
12:56 - make you know a conflicting checker for
12:58 - you that just pops it up immediately do
13:00 - you want me to make something that does
13:01 - the automatic schedules I did they were
13:03 - super happy and we estimated it save
13:05 - about four hours per week in labor cost
13:08 - right and that's two of them doing it
13:09 - that could save you
13:11 - 420 that could save you like you know 80
13:13 - 90 bucks a week that can save you a
13:15 - hundred bucks a week whatever it may be
13:16 - how much you're paying these people per
13:17 - hour so that is a really good way to
13:19 - make
13:20 - go to a local business identify a
13:22 - problem pitch a solution charge
13:24 - something that makes sense and then
13:26 - explain to them why they'll make their
13:28 - money back from the solution that you're
13:29 - pitching to them one thing that I would
13:32 - be doing right now if it wasn't running
13:33 - this YouTube channel I'm really into
13:35 - fishing a lot of the places I go fishing
13:37 - don't have websites they're super remote
13:39 - they're really far up north I'm you know
13:41 - they're just outdated a lot of the
13:42 - owners just aren't very into tech I mean
13:44 - they're running a fishing lodge with
13:46 - like five or six cabins and I said hey
13:47 - you know these are all your competitors
13:49 - they all have websites I could hardly
13:52 - even find you the reason I found you is
13:53 - cuz some random phone number why don't I
13:56 - make a website for you you know charge
13:57 - you 500 bucks
13:58 - and this will bring you so many more
13:59 - customers you get one person to go to
14:01 - your lodge you've already made all your
14:03 - money back right that's what I'm talking
14:05 - about and that's why I really like the
14:06 - solution because it is pretty lucrative
14:07 - you can make a lot of money you can also
14:09 - help a small business out at the same
14:11 - time and I think it's a win-win for both
14:12 - sides so that being said that has pretty
14:15 - much been it for my five ideas on how to
14:17 - make money programming without getting a
14:19 - job please let me know in the comments
14:21 - down below which one was your favorite
14:23 - if you've been doing any of these and if
14:24 - you've had success and with that being
14:26 - said I will see you guys in another
14:28 - YouTube video
