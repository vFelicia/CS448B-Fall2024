00:00 - let me explain to you the difference
00:01 - between Django and flask and which one
00:03 - you should use while Django is a high
00:05 - level full stack web framework that
00:07 - includes everything you need to write an
00:09 - entire application out of the box that
00:11 - means it has tools like authentication
00:13 - admin panels and an orm which is an
00:16 - object relational mapping used for
00:18 - working with your databases next we have
00:20 - flask now flask is known as a microweb
00:22 - framework that does not come with all
00:24 - these tools out of the box with that
00:26 - said it's much lighter weight it's much
00:27 - faster to get spun up and working with
00:29 - and it's a lot easier to learn if you're
00:31 - a beginner or working on some kind of
00:33 - small project so which one should you
00:34 - pick well if you want everything out of
00:36 - the box you're going to be creating a
00:37 - large application especially if you're
00:39 - going to have authentication probably go
00:41 - with Django if you're working on more of
00:43 - a hobby kind of a side project or
00:44 - something a little bit smaller I'd
00:46 - recommend flask now that's not to say
00:48 - you can't create a production ready
00:49 - application using flask you absolutely
00:51 - can but it just doesn't have the level
00:53 - of features and support that Django does
00:55 - so you'll likely be writing a lot more
00:57 - code than you need to
