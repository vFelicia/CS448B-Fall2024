00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back so I'm
00:01 - gonna start this video by wishing that
00:03 - all of you are safe and healthy and that
00:05 - you're doing okay during these tough
00:07 - times now I know that a lot is happening
00:09 - right now
00:10 - day by day things are changing and I'm
00:11 - sure that you guys are being affected by
00:13 - the corona virus and all of the things
00:15 - that are happening in the world right
00:16 - now what I want to encourage you to do
00:18 - in this video is to try to see some
00:20 - light in this situation and take
00:21 - advantage as much as possible of the
00:23 - spare time that you're gonna be given or
00:25 - that you're gonna have in the next weeks
00:26 - and months and that's why what I'm gonna
00:28 - do here is share with you my top five
00:30 - programming projects that you can work
00:32 - on while you're quarantined or while
00:34 - you're isolated now these projects gonna
00:36 - be a little bit different than some of
00:37 - the ones I've mentioned in previous
00:38 - videos because I'm going to assume that
00:40 - you're going to have a lot of time to
00:41 - work on these so I'm gonna suggest some
00:43 - bigger more impressive projects that are
00:45 - going to look great on a resume build
00:47 - your skills and allow you to learn new
00:48 - tools and technologies so we'll get into
00:50 - that in just a second just a quick word
00:52 - from our sponsor I need to thank simply
00:54 - learn for sponsoring this video and
00:56 - giving you all a discount on their data
00:57 - science master's course that's been
00:58 - co-developed with IBM this course is
01:01 - comprised of six full courses covering
01:03 - key technologies like our SAS Python
01:05 - tableau Hadoop and spark while working
01:08 - through this course you'll develop 15
01:10 - real-life projects and master over 30
01:12 - in-demand skills you will work with
01:13 - advanced analytics tools such as pandas
01:15 - use data collection tools like Apache
01:17 - HBase and learn ETL tools like hive Pig
01:20 - and scoop by purchasing this course
01:22 - you'll have lifetime access to all the
01:23 - course content and lectures receive 1200
01:26 - USD worth IBM cloud credits and have
01:28 - access to the IBM cloud platforms like
01:30 - IBM Watson for 24/7 practice upon
01:33 - completion will receive certificates
01:34 - from IBM and simply learn to testify to
01:37 - your skills as an expert in data science
01:39 - click the link in the description to get
01:41 - started so the first type of project
01:43 - that I like to recommend to everyone is
01:45 - something that has to do with web
01:46 - development now this can be simple this
01:48 - can be complex but what I usually
01:50 - recommend for at least beginning is to
01:52 - pick some kind of application that
01:53 - you've already built and try to recreate
01:55 - that in a web-based version so maybe you
01:57 - have like a text-based sorting algorithm
02:00 - or maybe you have a text-based inventory
02:02 - system or maybe you even already built a
02:04 - graphical user interface but it's for a
02:06 - specific operating system or maybe it's
02:08 - even an iPhone app or something like
02:10 - that try to take that and convert that
02:12 - into a web-based application
02:13 - now this is gonna mean that you don't
02:15 - have to write nearly as much code as if
02:17 - you were doing this project from scratch
02:18 - and you already have something to kind
02:20 - of base your project off of so what this
02:22 - is going to allow you to do is kind of
02:24 - skip all the grunt work with getting all
02:25 - this back-end stuff functioning and just
02:27 - focus on learning how web development
02:30 - actually works and how you can serve
02:31 - these kind of applications on the web
02:33 - now obviously this is going to involve
02:35 - the use of HTML and CSS although I'm
02:38 - pretty sure from at least talking to a
02:39 - lot of different programmers most people
02:41 - have a basic knowledge of this and if
02:43 - you don't it's going to be pretty easy
02:44 - to pick that up
02:45 - so some frameworks that I like to
02:46 - recommend at least to get started with
02:48 - web development if you know anything
02:50 - about python is flask now flask is a
02:52 - really simple and great web framework
02:54 - for doing applications like I just
02:56 - described something that's a few
02:57 - different pages it's not crazy complex
02:59 - maybe you have a database but you don't
03:01 - need to and it's just really easy to get
03:03 - set up again it's a Python back-end web
03:05 - framework then from there all you need
03:07 - to do is pick what you want to use for
03:09 - the front-end so with flask it's way
03:11 - easier just to use custom HTML and CSS
03:13 - and your own JavaScript but if you don't
03:16 - want to style the web page yourself you
03:18 - can always use a framework like
03:19 - bootstrap now bootstrap is really easy
03:21 - to use CSS framework essentially it
03:24 - allows you to use some built-in classes
03:26 - it allows you to do some animations and
03:28 - you can make a really good looking
03:30 - website without having much knowledge of
03:31 - HTML and CSS and personally what I
03:34 - always do is I set up my Python back-end
03:36 - a flask back-end which is really easy to
03:38 - get set up and then I style the entire
03:40 - front end using bootstrap and bootstrap
03:42 - has a really great website that has a
03:44 - ton of different examples of all of the
03:46 - classes that they have in the different
03:47 - usages so it's really easy to create
03:49 - anything that you want so that's my
03:51 - project idea number one takes some
03:53 - application you've already created and
03:54 - turn it into a web based app obviously
03:56 - there's so many different ways to do
03:58 - this let me know if you have any other
03:59 - frameworks that you think are better for
04:01 - this but anyone who knows Python I
04:02 - always recommend flask you want
04:04 - something a bit more complex you can go
04:05 - with Django and these are great
04:07 - frameworks they're fairly easy to learn
04:08 - and one lets you learn them it's gonna
04:10 - allow you to do so many different things
04:11 - so my second project idea is to
04:14 - implement some popular algorithms now I
04:16 - know this is quite vague and I'm not
04:17 - giving you any real examples although I
04:19 - will later but this is a really great
04:21 - way to show people that not only do you
04:23 - know how to program can you create a
04:25 - project but you can also implement
04:27 - and you know a bit about algorithms and
04:29 - data structures and this looks really
04:31 - good on a resume where you have a
04:32 - project that's impressive on its own but
04:34 - also implements a popular algorithm that
04:37 - shows yes you understand how this
04:38 - algorithm works and you were good enough
04:40 - to actually go in and implement that
04:41 - yourself now this isn't really that
04:43 - difficult there's tons of explanations
04:45 - online on how these algorithms work and
04:47 - I guarantee you'll learn a ton as you
04:49 - actually go through and try to program
04:50 - it yourself
04:51 - so some examples of this or something
04:53 - like a path finding algorithm so maybe
04:55 - you make a web interface or maybe you
04:56 - make some kind of interface where a user
04:58 - can pick a start point and an end point
05:00 - and then the algorithm runs and it finds
05:02 - the shortest path between these two
05:04 - points that's a great example of
05:05 - something that I've personally done that
05:07 - I think looks really good on a resume
05:08 - another example of implementing a
05:11 - popular algorithm is something like
05:12 - stable matching now many people don't
05:14 - know what stable matching is but let's
05:16 - say we have a bunch of employers and we
05:17 - have a bunch of students the employers
05:19 - rank the students based on who they want
05:21 - to hire and the students rank the
05:22 - employer is based on who they want to
05:23 - work for well given that information how
05:26 - can we find the best possible match for
05:28 - all of the employers and for all the
05:29 - students so that each person gets their
05:31 - top choice you know within reason right
05:33 - gets the best possible choice that they
05:35 - can have this is a really interesting
05:37 - problem and that's called stable
05:38 - matching and that's another example of
05:40 - something that you can implement so pick
05:41 - kind of any real-world problem anything
05:43 - you want
05:44 - pick an algorithm that you want to try
05:46 - to implement and then try to tie it into
05:47 - a project and that's a great way to
05:49 - showcase your skills and to have a
05:51 - really nice resume project and something
05:53 - to talk about in potential interviews so
05:55 - my next project idea is aimed towards
05:57 - those of you that really like hardware
05:59 - and a little bit more hands-on what I'm
06:00 - gonna recommend for you guys is to do
06:02 - something where you interface with a
06:03 - microcontroller so obviously you know
06:06 - little microcontrollers like this you
06:08 - can program to do all kinds of crazy
06:09 - things so a project I've actually done
06:12 - with this is a live security system so
06:14 - what I actually did was hooked up a
06:16 - little USB camera to this device and
06:18 - this is a Nvidia Jetson nano by the way
06:20 - it's a little bit on the higher end when
06:21 - it comes to microcontrollers and I ran a
06:23 - facial detection and recognition script
06:25 - on this so when you walked near the
06:27 - camera it would pick up who you are and
06:29 - it would track and log which person was
06:31 - in which room at what time now with that
06:34 - kind of information you can do whatever
06:35 - you want you can create some kind of
06:36 - charge so you can create graphs you can
06:38 - make a website to show that information
06:39 - but what I mean to say
06:41 - here is that if you can interface with a
06:43 - little piece of hardware you can maybe
06:44 - have some kind of sensor on it you can
06:46 - do something interesting with it maybe
06:47 - even just pressing a button then you can
06:49 - have some really cool software in the
06:50 - background that takes all the
06:52 - information that you get from this
06:53 - microcontroller and does something
06:55 - really cool with it
06:56 - and again the examples I usually like to
06:58 - use or something like you know motion
07:00 - detection you could do the facial
07:02 - detection and recognition script and you
07:04 - don't need to buy something like this
07:05 - which is called the Jetson Nano it's
07:06 - actually a Nvidia product which has a
07:08 - GPU on it that's why it's got that
07:10 - heatsink in the fan there you get
07:12 - something like a Raspberry Pi you can
07:14 - get an Arduino there's all kinds of
07:15 - cheaper microcontrollers that are only
07:17 - like 15 or 20 bucks if you can afford
07:19 - that in times like this there are a lot
07:21 - of fun and you can do a lot of cool
07:22 - stuff with them and they actually have
07:23 - all these pins on the side which are
07:24 - called GPIO pins and what those allow
07:27 - you to do is actually control the
07:29 - voltage that goes to those pins from the
07:31 - microcontroller so say you want to set
07:33 - up you know a little circuit to it you
07:34 - want to create a little more more
07:36 - intricate kind of program or project I'm
07:39 - sure some of you know a lot more about
07:40 - electronics than I do then you can do
07:42 - that with a board like this and it
07:44 - really opens up the possibilities for
07:45 - the kind of projects you can create
07:46 - especially if you like to see how
07:48 - they're working and see them kind of
07:50 - running you know in the actual physical
07:52 - world as opposed to just on your
07:53 - computer screen a lot of people make
07:55 - robots with these things you know the
07:56 - possibilities are endless
07:57 - Google best Raspberry Pi projects or
07:59 - something like that and you'll find an
08:00 - entire list of amazing things to work on
08:02 - so my fourth project idea is to
08:04 - implement a machine learning and
08:06 - artificial intelligence model into some
08:08 - kind of project now I'll give you a few
08:10 - examples near the end of this section
08:11 - but just hear me out here so if you
08:13 - don't know much about machine learning
08:14 - obviously that's gonna be the first step
08:16 - is learning a bit about machine learning
08:17 - picking something that you think is
08:19 - interesting and then picking a project
08:21 - that you can apply that to now for any
08:23 - of you that are getting started and you
08:25 - want to figure out well how can I even
08:26 - get a machine learning model up and
08:28 - running I personally have a ton of
08:29 - different tutorials on how to do that
08:31 - but a great resource and a website to go
08:33 - to is actually the tensorflow website so
08:35 - tensorflow is a very popular machine
08:37 - learning and AI framework it's usually
08:39 - used with Python although they do have a
08:41 - JavaScript framework as well and I
08:43 - believe they might have one for Java and
08:44 - some other languages too but what it
08:46 - does on the website there is it has a
08:48 - ton of awesome guides and tutorials that
08:50 - walk you through almost an entire
08:52 - project that has to deal with machine
08:55 - so what this is gonna do for you to show
08:56 - you exactly how to get this model set up
08:58 - how to train the model how it works but
09:01 - I will warn you that is a little bit
09:02 - vague on some of the explanations so
09:04 - what I usually like to do is I go to the
09:06 - website I copy down all the code make
09:08 - sure that this thing is working and then
09:10 - I go back and I try to understand how
09:12 - each individual component is working and
09:14 - look up some things on the side watch
09:16 - some videos and figure out how this
09:17 - actually works some examples of some
09:19 - things that I've done in terms of
09:21 - integrating are implementing models into
09:22 - projects is something with the amnesty
09:25 - cheat data set what I actually did is I
09:27 - made a PI game interface in Python that
09:29 - allowed you to draw a digit with the
09:31 - mouse like 0 is 701 whatever you want to
09:33 - draw and then it would feed that pixel
09:36 - data to my machine learning model which
09:37 - I pretty much had just copied exactly
09:39 - from the tensorflow website then it
09:41 - would spit out and tell me what number
09:43 - it's thought that I drew and this was
09:45 - actually pretty accurate it worked
09:46 - pretty well it was my first experience
09:48 - actually implementing this into a
09:50 - project and the reason this is great is
09:52 - because it's some tangible thing that
09:53 - you can actually use to interface with
09:55 - your model it makes it a little bit more
09:57 - interesting than just having this
09:59 - text-based accuracy score that you see
10:01 - in so many different tutorials and
10:02 - guides and it's just a really great
10:04 - thing to be like yeah not only do I know
10:06 - how this works
10:07 - I can implement it and I can integrate
10:09 - it into some kind of project alright so
10:11 - the last project that I recommend to
10:12 - everyone and probably my personal
10:14 - favorite to work on is recreating an
10:16 - Atari game now the reason I say Atari is
10:19 - because these are typically easier kind
10:21 - of pixel based games that most people
10:23 - can figure out how to make and there's
10:24 - so many resources online at least for
10:26 - the texture packs for them for some of
10:28 - the graphics and just is really easy to
10:30 - make like you know a version of Tetris
10:31 - or snake or these simple kind of games
10:34 - that still do teach you a lot about
10:35 - programming and are always fun and
10:37 - interesting to recreate so that is my
10:39 - last project idea for you you know if
10:41 - you're working in Python you can use
10:42 - something like PI game maybe this is a
10:44 - good opportunity to explore something
10:46 - like unity so unity is actually where
10:48 - you can make 3d games and I know there's
10:49 - a ton of videos online and tutorials
10:51 - from Unity themselves on how to do that
10:53 - maybe you want to explore something like
10:55 - augmented reality I know you can do that
10:56 - in unity as well and it's just just a
10:58 - great opportunity to you know mess
11:00 - around make some fun games and play them
11:02 - and share them with your friends or
11:03 - family or whoever you may be isolated or
11:05 - quarantined
11:06 - with so those have been my five
11:07 - programming projects to work on while
11:09 - you're quarantined now again guys I know
11:11 - these times are tough I know a lot of
11:13 - you're upset I know a lot of things that
11:15 - are horrible are going around in the
11:16 - world yes that doesn't mean we can't
11:19 - take advantage of the spare time that we
11:21 - have I see far too often that people get
11:23 - very upset they get very sad they sit on
11:25 - the couch they want watch Netflix all
11:27 - day although that's reasonable and it
11:28 - makes sense to me I think that if we can
11:30 - take advantage and try to see the
11:32 - positives in these times we're only
11:33 - gonna come out better from them and
11:35 - that's what I encourage you all to do so
11:37 - anyways that has been this video if you
11:38 - guys enjoyed make sure you leave a like
11:40 - subscribe to the channel and as always
11:42 - leave some other video ideas that you'd
11:44 - like to see in the comments down below
