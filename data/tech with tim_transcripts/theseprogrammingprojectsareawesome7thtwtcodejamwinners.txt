01:39 - who's going to win those and how that
01:41 - works in a minute for now though let me
01:43 - dive into kind of the theme and just a
01:45 - bit of context and then we'll get into
01:46 - all of the projects and if i'm boring
01:48 - you then you can skip forward there
01:49 - should be some time stamps when i
01:51 - actually start kind of demoing the top
01:52 - five projects all right so i'm just on
01:54 - the code jam information page here i'm
01:56 - going to give you a little bit of
01:57 - context first thing to note if you want
01:59 - to read any of this yourself you can go
02:01 - to the website twtcodejam.net
02:03 - i also want to give a massive thank you
02:05 - to everyone who participated here as
02:07 - well as my discord staff team for
02:09 - organizing this doing all of the grading
02:11 - which i'm going to talk about in a
02:12 - second and generally just spending a
02:14 - bunch of time helping out the community
02:15 - really appreciate it guys i also want to
02:17 - note if you did not get in the top 5 or
02:19 - the top 15 or anything like that please
02:21 - don't be discouraged please submit again
02:23 - i've seen many of you guys submit over
02:25 - multiple code gems and you just keep
02:26 - getting better and better and that's
02:28 - really the point of this yes the prizes
02:30 - are nice but i want to give you guys an
02:31 - opportunity to practice and create some
02:33 - cool coding projects regardless though
02:35 - the theme for this code jam was make
02:37 - every day a little less ordinary and the
02:39 - way that the projects were graded is
02:41 - once people submitted them that
02:43 - approximately two weeks by the way to
02:44 - work on these projects my discord staff
02:46 - team went through and graded every
02:48 - single project out of 40. now they use
02:51 - the following four pieces of criteria
02:53 - the theme the functionality the code and
02:56 - the intuitiveness of the project to
02:57 - grade it then once all the projects were
02:59 - graded we were able to narrow it down to
03:01 - the top 15. once we had the top 15 i
03:04 - sent the 15 projects to nick white and
03:06 - ben ayowa who are two celebrity judges
03:08 - for this code gym so big thank you to
03:11 - them and we're gonna hear from them in a
03:12 - few minutes actually they also have
03:14 - great youtube channels which i'll leave
03:15 - in the description regardless though
03:17 - they then graded the projects that
03:19 - allowed us to narrow it down to the top
03:21 - five and those top five is what i'm
03:23 - showing you here now both nick and ben
03:25 - did select their favorite project and
03:28 - what they selected or the team that they
03:30 - selected is going to get a special prize
03:31 - outside of the prizes that i already
03:33 - mentioned uh and with that said we can
03:35 - dive into the projects apologize for the
03:38 - long intro just want to give you guys
03:39 - the full context here now we will look
03:41 - at the top five and then announce who
03:43 - the winning teams are all right so
03:45 - diving in here i have project number one
03:48 - i'm not showing these in any particular
03:49 - order just going through the different
03:51 - uh projects that are in the top five so
03:53 - this project here is called friend court
03:55 - now i believe that this is kind of like
03:57 - a tinder knockoff with discord we're
03:59 - gonna have a look at it in a second uh
04:01 - but the contributors here are soul ninja
04:04 - and i am saptorishi uh apologize if i'm
04:07 - mispronouncing that i'm probably am
04:09 - anyways you get the point to that is who
04:11 - created this so let's actually click in
04:13 - here to friend court already have it
04:15 - open uh we can see we met on discord
04:17 - meet new folks with new niches every day
04:19 - at friend court okay so let me log in
04:21 - with discord once i do that i'll be
04:22 - right back all right so i've just signed
04:24 - in here now i will note that i did use
04:26 - this previously when i used it the first
04:28 - time it did ask me to select my interest
04:30 - so that's why it's not doing it here but
04:32 - it looks like i can view different
04:34 - profiles here and swipe left and right
04:37 - uh based on if i like the profile and if
04:39 - i want to make a friend or get a match
04:40 - or whatever so i can see can i click on
04:43 - him no okay i can't click on him but i
04:44 - have interest we have the pronouns we
04:46 - have
04:47 - anything highlighted that we both like
04:49 - doing so we both like gaming we both
04:51 - love coding okay great
04:53 - let's give a like on that uh let's see
04:55 - if i can swipe left
04:56 - okay and it says go touch some grass uh
04:58 - try reloading to fetch more profiles if
05:00 - that doesn't work come back after some
05:02 - time i imagine just not many people have
05:04 - actually signed up for this website uh
05:06 - so that's probably why we're not seeing
05:07 - it and then i can go to matches here and
05:10 - if i had any matches i would see them
05:12 - but apparently i don't i guess you guys
05:14 - didn't want to uh to match with me on
05:15 - this platform
05:17 - anyways that is fine uh oh and if i come
05:19 - back okay there is actually more people
05:20 - so i had to refresh the feed so let's
05:22 - swipe and see if we get some matches
05:25 - okay matches
05:27 - uh let's see no unfortunately we don't
05:28 - have any okay so it looks like that's it
05:31 - for friend cord
05:33 - i'm not sure what else i could mess
05:34 - around with here seems like filter is
05:36 - blurred out for some reason and then of
05:38 - course i can log out
05:39 - and i get brought back to the home page
05:41 - overall great project here definitely
05:44 - fits the theme make life a little less
05:46 - ordinary everything is very clean it
05:48 - works it's intuitive great job guys
05:50 - let's move on to the next project
05:52 - alright so moving on here to another
05:54 - project this one is called proactive
05:56 - although i've seen it called proact as
05:58 - well just from scrolling through the

13:02 - post and there we go okay achievements
13:05 - habit master complete 60-day streak web
13:08 - usage okay so this is for the chrome
13:10 - extension so i can look at that in a
13:11 - second uh but yeah this looks really
13:13 - cool nice idea good project everything
13:16 - is very
13:18 - sleek everything looks good although
13:19 - when i like this i guess it's instantly
13:21 - moving up which i don't quite like
13:23 - because i don't get the feedback on
13:24 - actually pressing the button
13:26 - other than that though really good job
13:28 - guys and looks like of course i can log
13:30 - out from here okay so let me try that
13:31 - chrome extension then i'll be right back
13:33 - okay so i installed the chrome extension
13:34 - here was actually pretty easy to do you
13:36 - can see that it's right here zero to
13:37 - chad website time tracker it doesn't
13:40 - allow me to really do anything from the
13:41 - extension but it does actually now show
13:43 - me this graph here of minutes spent and
13:46 - on what website now of course i haven't
13:47 - been on long enough for it to give me
13:49 - really any information but it did kind
13:51 - of show up that it was registering my
13:53 - time and if i refresh here let's see if
13:55 - it shows anything else okay refresh one
13:57 - more time uh no it just says uh minutes
14:00 - spent and it was showing github there a
14:01 - second ago because i was on github
14:03 - anyways i'm going to trust this works
14:05 - i'm not going to go through and actually
14:06 - test this over you know the span of a
14:08 - few hours regardless though really great
14:10 - project guys all of these have been
14:11 - super impressive so far this is going to
14:13 - be a tough decision let's move on though
14:15 - to project number four alright so moving
14:17 - on to project number four now this one i
14:20 - believe is called uno life uh and this
14:22 - is by a bunch of cells fire plank and
14:24 - snowball now i'm not familiar with bunch
14:27 - of cells but i do know fire plank and
14:29 - snowball from the discord server these
14:30 - guys have been around for a very long
14:32 - time fireplank and i have actually
14:33 - played chess a few times on chess.com uh
14:36 - and yeah he beat me pretty much every
14:38 - single time because he's like way better
14:40 - anyways uh looks like this is made
14:42 - completely in rust i have a ross
14:43 - tutorial series right now they must have
14:45 - been watching that anyways let's have a
14:47 - quick look at this okay so looks like we
14:49 - actually need to run this from the
14:51 - desktop let me install it and we can
14:53 - have a look and see what uno life is all
14:55 - about
14:56 - alright so i've got it installed and
14:58 - opened up it was actually super easy to
14:59 - do this so thank you guys for that uh

16:13 - keys this reminds me of the snake game i
16:15 - made uh in in python looks very similar
16:18 - except the head of the snake doesn't
16:19 - have eyes like mine did
16:21 - okay nice so we can play snake let's see
16:23 - if i can kill myself okay there we go
16:25 - you lost i hit the edge of the screen
16:26 - okay let's do another game let's try
16:28 - 2048 uh how would i do this oh i just
16:31 - have to hit down
16:33 - uh or right or whatever on my keyboard i
16:35 - wouldn't mind if they showed the
16:36 - controls here on on the screen it would
16:39 - probably be a little bit easier
16:41 - but
16:42 - that's all good
16:43 - okay and then yeah we can play 2048 nice
16:45 - i'm not going to continue on with that
16:48 - uh 15 puzzle okay so we have 15 puzzles
16:51 - now i have no idea what this game is so
16:53 - it would be nice if there was some kind
16:54 - of instructions or something um or at
16:56 - least a little bit of info because again
16:58 - i just don't i don't even know what the
17:00 - goal is here uh maybe i'm trying to
17:02 - arrange it 1 to 15. i'm not going to go
17:04 - through because i could fully be doing
17:06 - the wrong thing but nice okay another
17:08 - game
17:09 - show meme

17:35 - work here guys great project pretty
17:37 - unique to use rust i didn't see anyone
17:39 - else use rust and you made a desktop
17:41 - application as opposed to a website uh
17:43 - so definitely points for creativity with
17:45 - that said though let's go on to project
17:47 - number five alright so moving on to
17:49 - project number five now this one is
17:52 - random iq i want to find the
17:55 - contributors here i didn't see it on

20:12 - website simple but cool idea definitely
20:15 - does make life a little less ordinary so
20:17 - 100 fits the theme very good job guys
20:20 - again a few cosmetic things i think
20:22 - would have been kind of simple and just
20:23 - cleaned up the website quite a bit other
20:25 - than that though very nice job so that i
20:27 - believe was the fifth and final project
20:30 - now that we have gone through those let
20:32 - me take a quick break and then i'm going
20:34 - to announce to you the three winning
20:36 - projects as well as some special prizes
20:38 - uh based on some projects that our
20:40 - celebrity judges sorry have selected all

22:11 - coded in rust every single game
22:14 - which i thought was quite impressive
22:15 - because i cannot code and rust but i
22:18 - hear russ is really cool so when i saw
22:20 - data and rust i was envious and i was
22:22 - like
22:23 - they deserve an extra prize because they
22:25 - put the extra effort to code all the
22:28 - things in russ when they could just done
22:29 - in python so that's why i liked it yeah
22:32 - awesome all right well there you go so i
22:34 - believe it is team rusty uno life you

23:10 - you nick for helping out helping us with
23:12 - judging and i just have one simple
23:14 - question for you what was your favorite
23:16 - project out of the ones that you looked
23:18 - at and why
23:20 - uh i really liked friend cord by touch
23:23 - some grass pro
23:25 - just because
23:26 - it was the most um polished project
23:30 - tinder swiping is not exactly easy to
23:32 - implement and then they
23:34 - uh hooked it up to discord which is
23:35 - pretty cool
23:36 - kind of a unique idea kind of a fun idea
23:39 - and um
23:40 - i don't know i just took more creativity
23:42 - i think than a lot of the other projects
23:44 - for sure i would definitely agree so
23:46 - thank you very much nick for helping out
23:47 - and being a celebrity judge that team is
23:49 - going to be getting a special prize
23:50 - because you selected them as your
23:52 - favorite project and hopefully we can
23:54 - have you back for the next code gem
23:56 - thank you for having me all right so big
23:58 - thank you here to ben and nick for
24:00 - selecting their favorite projects if you
24:02 - worked on one of the projects that they
24:04 - selected then you're going to be winning
24:05 - a programming expert license key
24:07 - completely for free every member of the
24:09 - team is going to get one
24:11 - all right so now without further ado
24:13 - let's now to the top three again very
24:16 - difficult decision and we're going to
24:17 - start with third place so drum roll
24:19 - please editors put in some suspenseful
24:21 - music or something the third place team
24:24 - is
24:25 - zero to chat so zero to chad third place
24:29 - let me just quickly find who wrote this
24:30 - again milan and name i cannot pronounce
24:34 - anise or something like that again i
24:36 - apologize uh this was your project you
24:39 - created kind of the habit tracker you
24:40 - had the uh what was this the chrome
24:43 - extension which i did verify was working
24:45 - afterwards you had achievements you had
24:47 - posts you had kind of like a social
24:48 - network aspect to this and i thought you
24:50 - guys did a really good job this was an
24:52 - awesome project and the only reason i'm
24:54 - actually placing this third as opposed
24:55 - to going higher was i just felt that the
24:57 - styling could have been done a little
24:59 - bit better it didn't look quite as
25:00 - polished as some of the other projects
25:02 - but again i think you guys did a really
25:04 - awesome job you had a great amount of
25:06 - features
25:07 - and definitely fit the theme as well
25:09 - making life a little less ordinary so
25:11 - thank you guys for your submission
25:12 - congratulations on third place i'll
25:14 - reach out to you on how you can claim
25:15 - your prize so now we move on to second
25:18 - and first place now this was a very
25:20 - difficult decision i'm not gonna make
25:22 - you wait any longer the second place
25:24 - project was dramatic pause please friend
25:28 - cord now friend cord this in my opinion
25:31 - was the most polished project i thought
25:32 - it was one of the best ideas out of all
25:34 - the ones that we had yes it is kind of
25:36 - cloning and mirroring uh you know
25:38 - something like uh tinder but i just
25:40 - thought it was a creative idea and it's
25:41 - really easy to use everything seemed to
25:43 - work unfortunately i didn't get any
25:45 - matches but i'm not going to penalize
25:46 - you for that and i just thought the
25:48 - styling was good everything was good
25:50 - generally again just no real negative
25:52 - feedback that i can give this project so
25:54 - that's why i selected it for second
25:55 - place uh and now once i announce first
25:57 - place i will just discuss why i chose
26:00 - that over this for first place so
26:02 - congratulations guys i'm gonna put up
26:03 - whoever made this on the screen and i'll
26:05 - reach out to you for your prizes but now
26:06 - we need to discuss who won first so the
26:10 - first place project here as i'm sure
26:12 - many of you have already guessed is
26:15 - proact now again this was a really
26:17 - difficult decision i was between friend
26:19 - court and pro act for first and second
26:21 - and the reason i went with proact here
26:23 - was just because i thought that this had
26:25 - a lot more features there was a lot more
26:27 - to it than friend cord and this as well
26:29 - was very polished everything with the
26:31 - exception of that one paragraph that i
26:33 - found that said lorem ipsum was you know
26:35 - pretty well done there was just so many
26:37 - different workouts we had three
26:39 - different modes inside of here yes it
26:41 - was a little bit laggy on this screen
26:43 - but i'm willing to forgive that just
26:44 - because of the sheer amount of content
26:46 - that was on this website i just thought
26:48 - that when we're comparing the two yes
26:50 - one was more polished than the other but
26:52 - this had so much stuff that i just
26:54 - thought it deserved the win i'm sure you
26:55 - put a ton of work into this and really
26:58 - that's kind of why i selected it for
26:59 - first place again i thought the idea was
27:01 - good definitely does make life less
27:03 - ordinary and overall just a really good
27:05 - job on all these projects making it very
27:07 - difficult for me to decide so i'm gonna
27:09 - put up who made this project on the
27:10 - screen congratulations to all of our
27:12 - winners to who these celebrity judges
27:14 - selected and really to everyone who
27:16 - submitted a project i do these code gems
27:18 - that you guys can have fun so that i can
27:20 - have a cool video to post every few
27:21 - months and showcase some community
27:23 - projects and if you guys like this idea
27:25 - of kind of showcasing what people in the
27:27 - community have made we can do this more
27:29 - informally as well going forward where i
27:31 - showed just some cool community projects
27:33 - that weren't necessarily made uh just
27:35 - for something like this like a coding
27:37 - competition so with that said i am going
27:39 - to wrap up the video here again
27:41 - congratulations to everyone thank you
27:43 - all for participating thank you to my
27:45 - discord staff team thank you to algo
27:47 - expert for sponsoring this competition
27:49 - and i have no more thank you so i'll
