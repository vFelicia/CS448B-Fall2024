00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back to the
00:02 - youtube video
00:03 - so in today's video i will be discussing
00:05 - why i think everybody
00:06 - including yourself should learn how to
00:08 - code now i'm not just targeting this at
00:10 - people that want to become software
00:11 - engineers or get into the tech industry
00:13 - i think everybody can get a tremendous
00:15 - amount of value from learning how to
00:17 - code and i'll give you five reasons why
00:19 - in this video
00:20 - now before we get started let me quickly
00:22 - mention that the sponsor of today's
00:23 - video which is fast host
00:25 - is doing a massive giveaway if you're
00:27 - located in the uk
00:28 - and you can answer my techie test
00:30 - question which i'll be talking about
00:32 - later in the video
00:33 - you'll have a chance to win your
00:34 - ultimate tech setup including your dream
00:37 - pc
00:37 - with up to 5 000 pounds this is an
00:40 - awesome giveaway and i'll be talking
00:41 - about how you can enter
00:42 - later in the video
00:46 - [Music]
00:52 - so the first and number one reason i
00:54 - recommend people learn how to code
00:56 - is that it teaches them how to think and
00:57 - it teaches them how to problem solve
00:59 - these two skills are so important in
01:02 - every aspect of life
01:04 - and unfortunately i see especially in
01:06 - today's youth they're just being lost
01:08 - deteriorated and a lot of people really
01:10 - are not learning them
01:11 - at all now you can blame whoever you
01:13 - want for that you can blame the school
01:14 - system whatever it may be
01:15 - but i think it is so important to be
01:17 - good at problem solving and critical
01:19 - thinking
01:19 - and well coding will definitely help you
01:21 - do that when you're programming you are
01:24 - going to encounter
01:25 - hundreds of problems probably every day
01:28 - and you need to be able to break those
01:29 - problems down
01:30 - think about them and solve them there is
01:33 - not going to be anyone there holding
01:34 - your hand and telling you what to do
01:36 - although you can find answers on google
01:39 - to be able
01:40 - to even interpret those answers and
01:42 - understand what's being said
01:43 - it really requires a lot of thinking and
01:45 - that is one of the reasons i personally
01:47 - really like coding
01:48 - because it forces me to think it forces
01:51 - me to really use my brain
01:53 - and i cannot think of many other
01:54 - situations where i use my brain power as
01:56 - much as when i'm sitting in front of the
01:58 - computer and programming
02:00 - and of course this also happens when
02:02 - you're just learning how to code
02:03 - building a mental model of what's going
02:05 - on in this programming language and
02:07 - thinking about the tools that you have
02:09 - and how you can apply them to certain
02:11 - problems is such an important skill and
02:13 - you
02:13 - master that when you get good at
02:15 - programming even learning the basic
02:17 - concepts the basic
02:19 - logic really does teach you a lot and i
02:22 - want to tell you a quick story about
02:23 - when i taught kids how to code they were
02:25 - between 8 and 15 years old to really
02:27 - drill this point home
02:28 - so a bit of context for about five years
02:30 - i worked at a summer camp
02:32 - for three of those years i ran a coding
02:34 - specialty there
02:35 - which ran about three hours each day and
02:38 - the goal of it it was a week long was to
02:40 - teach kids basic python programming and
02:42 - be able to create their own choose your
02:43 - own adventure game or quiz game by the
02:45 - end of the week
02:47 - super successful program a lot of kids
02:49 - really enjoyed it and it was one of the
02:50 - highlights of my summer every time that
02:52 - i did it was really seeing these kids
02:54 - learning
02:54 - and introducing them to a new technology
02:56 - that genuinely could change their life
02:58 - because
02:59 - not many people learn python programming
03:01 - at 10 11 12 years old this was around 8
03:04 - to 15 that was the age range for this
03:06 - specialty
03:07 - so i just wanted to tell you a quick
03:08 - story about the number one
03:10 - factor that led to a kid's success in
03:12 - this program and you can probably guess
03:14 - what it was
03:15 - but it was simply their ability to think
03:18 - i had kids of all different age ranges
03:21 - all different backgrounds all different
03:23 - you know some went to private school
03:24 - some went to public school
03:26 - some were exchange students whatever it
03:27 - may be i had every person you can
03:29 - imagine every type of kid in this group
03:32 - and the number one factor it was not age
03:34 - it was not gender it was not what school
03:36 - they went to it wasn't good
03:37 - how good they were at math it was simply
03:39 - their ability to think that affected how
03:41 - good they were going to be
03:42 - in this program and it really just
03:44 - opened my eyes to that fact that
03:46 - programming is such a good way to
03:48 - practice problem solving and to practice
03:50 - thinking and the kids they were already
03:52 - good at doing that picked it up
03:54 - so quickly they were the ones who would
03:56 - look at a problem on the board and go
03:58 - off and try to solve it themselves they
04:00 - would be the ones who would sit there
04:01 - for an hour and slam the laptop on their
04:03 - face and be like i can't get it but yet
04:05 - still not ask me a question
04:07 - because they wanted to struggle through
04:08 - and figure it out whereas most the other
04:11 - kids i had would give it about 30
04:12 - seconds
04:13 - one two three minutes maybe and then
04:15 - immediately come up to me with their
04:16 - laptop and say hey i don't know how to
04:18 - do it can you help me can you can you
04:19 - fix it for me
04:20 - so i always tried my hardest to make
04:22 - sure that they thought through
04:23 - everything before i gave them any
04:24 - answers
04:25 - but it just really opened my eyes how
04:28 - important thinking was
04:29 - and how having that skill especially at
04:31 - a young age even having a kid that was
04:33 - say eight years old he could easily
04:34 - outperform someone who was 14 or 15
04:37 - simply because he wanted to think so
04:39 - i'll just leave that with you
04:40 - so the second reason i recommend
04:42 - learning to code is because there is a
04:43 - huge opportunity
04:45 - especially right now to make money from
04:47 - coding
04:48 - the demand for programmers is so high
04:51 - and
04:51 - not just programmers that are working as
04:53 - software engineers at a company
04:55 - of course the best way you're going to
04:56 - make money programming and one of the
04:58 - safest ways would be to go get a job
05:00 - at some company right and get paid to
05:02 - program i understand most the people
05:03 - watching this
05:04 - might not be doing that that might not
05:06 - be a goal of theirs
05:07 - what you can do however though is make
05:09 - money on the side with your programming
05:11 - skills
05:12 - now i don't want to get into this too
05:13 - much because i have a whole video
05:14 - covering it
05:15 - so i will link that video in the
05:16 - description and put a card somewhere in
05:19 - the corner here that you can click on
05:21 - but one of the great things with
05:22 - programming is if you're someone who's
05:23 - entrepreneurial you want to start a
05:25 - business some kind of digital product
05:27 - you don't need to pay someone or get an
05:29 - investment to do that
05:30 - you can build it yourself now of course
05:32 - that's going to take you some time
05:34 - but let's say all the only reason you
05:36 - want to learn how to code is so you can
05:37 - build
05:38 - a website then literally just learn
05:40 - exactly what you need to do to build
05:42 - the thing that you're trying to build
05:44 - that's what i do whenever i'm trying to
05:45 - build something new
05:46 - i don't care about all the other stuff i
05:48 - just focus completely
05:49 - on whatever is going to help me build
05:51 - the project that i'm trying to build
05:53 - you don't need to be a software engineer
05:54 - you don't need to learn data structures
05:56 - and algorithms
05:57 - just learn enough to build the product
05:59 - you want and you can probably build that
06:01 - in just a few months
06:02 - so it's a great opportunity with really
06:05 - low cost maybe you have to rent a server
06:06 - or something that's like 5 or 10 bucks a
06:08 - month
06:08 - to try out a company to try out a
06:10 - business idea and hey
06:12 - you never know we've seen products like
06:13 - instagram snapchat
06:15 - all these things that started off really
06:17 - bare bones that had pretty much
06:19 - no crazy features that were built by one
06:21 - or two people that have exploded into
06:23 - huge massive companies where the owners
06:25 - now are making billions of dollars a
06:27 - year
06:27 - i'm not saying that's going to be you
06:28 - but that is the potential you have by
06:30 - learning a skill like
06:31 - program now if you are looking to use
06:33 - your coding ability in an
06:34 - entrepreneurial way where you're going
06:35 - to be hosting an app or a website or
06:37 - whatever it may be
06:38 - you may be interested in the sponsor of
06:40 - this video fast host is a uk-based web
06:42 - hosting company which offers a wide
06:44 - range of web hosting products
06:46 - and other services they aim to support

07:09 - performance hardware with intel xeon
07:11 - processors
07:12 - and storage options including super fast
07:14 - nvmes this is perfect for demanding
07:16 - projects
07:17 - so now it's time to talk about the
07:19 - giveaway as i mentioned earlier if
07:21 - you're located in the uk
07:23 - you have a chance to win the ultimate
07:24 - tech setup and your dream pc worth up to
07:27 - 5 000 pounds
07:28 - to enter simply answer the following
07:30 - techie test question
07:32 - what year was the basic programming
07:34 - language invented
07:35 - you can submit your answers and enter
07:37 - the giveaway by hitting the link in the
07:38 - description
07:39 - and get started on your next project by
07:41 - checking out fast hosts
07:43 - now the next reason i think you should
07:45 - learn how to code is because you can
07:47 - automate repetitive tasks
07:49 - i think this is a really underrated
07:51 - reason but you can actually build some
07:52 - really cool projects and tools that
07:54 - automate things that you might do on
07:56 - your average day that take you a long
07:58 - period of time
07:59 - now it's hard for me to come up with
08:00 - great examples because this is really
08:02 - specific to what you do and what you're
08:04 - working on on a day-to-day basis
08:06 - but say you do a lot of data entry it's
08:07 - probably the best example and you take
08:09 - one excel spreadsheet and you have to
08:11 - take some columns of it or some rows
08:13 - from it and put it in another
08:14 - spreadsheet or make a graph of it or
08:15 - something like that
08:16 - well rather than doing that yourself you
08:18 - could spend maybe half the time it would
08:20 - normally take you to do that
08:21 - to just program out a really basic tool
08:24 - that can do it for you
08:25 - i know personally for me a lot of the
08:27 - time when i used to get given data entry
08:29 - jobs i used to work
08:30 - a long time ago when i was probably 14
08:32 - for an automation company funnier enough
08:35 - it was a home automation company
08:36 - and they needed me to do some like a
08:38 - really monotonous data entry it was
08:39 - going to take me like two weeks
08:41 - i had to look through like 5 000 lines
08:44 - of this spreadsheet
08:45 - and i had to look for all of the
08:46 - companies that had like a certain code
08:48 - beside their name
08:49 - and put it in another spreadsheet anyway
08:51 - something basic like that
08:52 - and after i was doing it for like an
08:54 - hour or two i was like this is taking a
08:55 - really long time
08:57 - i know how to program let me see if i
08:58 - can come up with something that would
08:59 - just do this automatically it wasn't
09:01 - super complicated what i had to do
09:03 - and within about two or three hours i
09:05 - was actually making a fully functioning
09:07 - bot
09:07 - that could automatically do all of the
09:09 - data entry i was supposed to do
09:11 - so i hand back to my boss you know at
09:13 - the end of the day i'm like yeah i
09:14 - finished it and he's like how did you do
09:16 - that like that's impossible
09:17 - like did you give this to someone else
09:18 - with someone else working on you i'm
09:20 - like no
09:20 - this is just a script i wrote that did
09:22 - it right and then all of a sudden
09:24 - the next day i didn't have very much
09:25 - work to do right so just basic things
09:27 - like that
09:28 - if you know how to program it opens up
09:30 - your ability to create
09:31 - these really cool tools that can save
09:33 - you honestly hours maybe even days of
09:35 - time
09:36 - so the fourth reason i think you should
09:37 - learn how to code is because coding is
09:39 - the language of the future
09:41 - what i mean by this is more and more
09:43 - people are learning how to code
09:44 - more people know how to code today than
09:45 - they ever have before
09:47 - and while i can only imagine that trend
09:49 - is going to continue upwards
09:51 - i know here in ontario they've
09:53 - implemented coding into our school
09:54 - system as early as grade two
09:56 - i know it was in my high school system
09:58 - in university i know a lot of people in
10:00 - majors
10:00 - not related to computer science that had
10:02 - to take programming
10:04 - and well i can only imagine that as the
10:07 - years go on
10:08 - it's going to become more required and
10:09 - more mandatory and more people are going
10:11 - to assume that you have an idea of what
10:14 - programming is
10:15 - i think back in the day it was given the
10:17 - wrap that only the really smart people
10:18 - were programming
10:19 - only the nerves were programming
10:21 - whatever it may be but now programming
10:23 - is becoming something that is much more
10:25 - mainstream
10:26 - i have no idea where it's going to go or
10:28 - what's going to end up happening
10:29 - but i just want to make an interesting
10:30 - comparison for you to consider
10:32 - so in school we learn about geography
10:35 - history
10:36 - math biology we learn a lot of basic
10:39 - things and gather a lot of knowledge
10:40 - that most people assume
10:42 - we all know right if you go in a room
10:44 - and you ask people what country do you
10:45 - live in
10:46 - most of them know the answer to that
10:48 - right now i know that sounds like a
10:49 - stupid thing to say
10:50 - but think about it the world we live in
10:53 - right now is so
10:54 - digital that i'd say about 50 of our
10:56 - time every day is spent in this digital
10:59 - world we're on a computer we're dealing
11:00 - with a web browser we're
11:02 - you know searching the web on our phone
11:04 - we're calling someone texting someone
11:06 - yet how many people understand how any
11:09 - of that works and what any of that
11:10 - really is i would say a very small
11:13 - percentage of the population
11:14 - and i would think just with common sense
11:17 - if we're going to be living in such a
11:19 - digital high-tech world
11:20 - it would make sense to have some kind of
11:22 - understanding of how that world operated
11:25 - right
11:25 - just like you learn about the physics of
11:27 - like i throw a ball up it goes down
11:29 - maybe we should understand the physics
11:30 - of this digital world that we're living
11:32 - in
11:32 - more and more that's kind of my only
11:34 - point here with this one here
11:36 - but i just think that you're doing
11:37 - yourself a little bit of a disservice by
11:39 - not
11:39 - learning to code or at least having a
11:42 - very basic understanding
11:43 - of what that actually means now the
11:46 - fifth and final reason why i think you
11:48 - should learn how to code
11:49 - is because it makes an impression on
11:51 - people and it looks great on a resume
11:53 - let me expand upon this by first asking
11:55 - you to consider
11:57 - the following situation so say you met
11:59 - me you had no idea who i was
12:01 - and you asked me the question hey oh you
12:04 - know what program are you studying what
12:05 - courses are you in blah blah blah you
12:07 - asked me something like that related to
12:08 - school
12:09 - and i told you oh i'm actually in
12:11 - astrophysics that's what i told you i'm
12:13 - in astrophysics
12:14 - what would your immediate impression of
12:15 - me be just without knowing anything else
12:17 - just being able to see me and hearing
12:19 - that
12:20 - you would probably think oh he must be
12:22 - smart right
12:23 - and anyone that tells you they're in
12:24 - astrophysics unless they have some other
12:26 - crazy quality about them that you know
12:28 - you probably think that they are smart
12:30 - anyone who says they're in applied
12:32 - mathematics or advanced
12:33 - physics or whatever it may be you
12:36 - probably think that they are smart these
12:37 - are the stereotypes we associate with
12:39 - certain degrees with
12:40 - certain people now the same thing
12:42 - happens with coding
12:44 - if you tell someone that you know how to
12:46 - code and if they
12:47 - don't know very much about that subject
12:50 - they're going to assume that you have a
12:52 - certain level of intelligence
12:54 - now that level of intelligence is going
12:55 - to be based on whatever their bias is
12:57 - whatever
12:58 - they've seen and know about coding if
13:00 - they know a little bit about it they
13:01 - might know oh
13:02 - okay you don't have to actually be that
13:03 - good to be good at coding and maybe that
13:05 - doesn't mean anything to them
13:06 - but for a vast majority of people
13:08 - especially ones that know nothing about
13:10 - tech
13:10 - they're going to assume that you are
13:12 - smart and that is only going to be to
13:14 - your advantage if you can make a good
13:16 - first impression on people
13:17 - i'm not saying go out and tell everyone
13:19 - you know how to code but more in say
13:20 - like a job interview situation or on
13:23 - a resume that is a huge advantage if
13:25 - you're applying to a job that's not tech
13:27 - related at all
13:28 - yet you know how to program and that's
13:30 - front and center on your resume and
13:32 - people can see that
13:33 - well that is going to be an advantage
13:34 - for you and it's going to make you stand
13:36 - out another thing too right is that if
13:38 - you go to the interview and you say oh
13:40 - this is a cool automation tool i made
13:42 - to speed up my workflow not only does
13:44 - that show that you're taking initiative
13:45 - to be more efficient and productive
13:47 - but it shows that you know something
13:49 - that almost no one else who's applying
13:51 - here does
13:51 - and that's something that the
13:53 - interviewer is going to remember about
13:55 - you right
13:55 - so that is just another reason to learn
13:57 - to code honestly it just
13:59 - makes you look good i can't tell you the
14:01 - amount of people i've told them i'm in
14:02 - computer science
14:03 - and immediately our conversation the
14:05 - tone of it drastically changes
14:06 - maybe they were talking down to me
14:08 - before maybe they thought i was dumb
14:09 - whatever it may be
14:10 - now all of a sudden they have a
14:12 - different perspective of me because
14:13 - i'm in computer science so just
14:15 - something to keep in mind and the last
14:17 - thing i wanted to bring up because i
14:18 - think it
14:19 - is a huge asset especially if you're
14:21 - applying to jobs and it's not like your
14:23 - main
14:24 - skill it's something on the side that
14:25 - you can talk about so anyways
14:27 - that has been this video don't forget
14:30 - to answer that techie test question all
14:32 - the information is in the description
14:34 - if you're in the uk and be entered to
