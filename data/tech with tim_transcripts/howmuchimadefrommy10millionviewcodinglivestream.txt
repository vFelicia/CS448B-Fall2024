00:00 - three and a half years ago I decided it
00:02 - would be a good idea to sit down and
00:04 - live stream myself coding for 12 hours
00:06 - now it turns out you guys like to watch
00:08 - me suffer and this video now has over 10
00:11 - million views let me show you some of
00:13 - the analytics for it so 10.1 million
00:16 - views 428.5
00:19 - 000 hours of watch time I gained 88 000
00:22 - subscribers and I made 18 000 Canadian
00:25 - dollars now this revenue is fantastic
00:27 - but if we go to the tab here you can see
00:29 - that I only have a 1.80 RPM that's
00:33 - actually extremely low for my channel
00:34 - usually I get four or five dollar RPM so
00:37 - you can picture the amount of money I
00:39 - missed out on on this stream regardless
00:41 - thank you all for watching and let me
00:42 - know if you want to see another coding
00:43 - live stream in the comments
