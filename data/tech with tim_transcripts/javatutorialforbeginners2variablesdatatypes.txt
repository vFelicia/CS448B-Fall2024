00:00 - hello and welcome to video 2 in our Java
00:03 - programming tutorial series for
00:05 - beginners so you can see where we are
00:08 - right where we left off with printing
00:09 - two lines hello world - hello world - to
00:11 - the screen and in this video I'm gonna
00:13 - be going over variables and data types
00:15 - the absolute fundamentals we have to
00:17 - understand before we can move on to
00:18 - anything more complex so let's talk
00:22 - about what a variable is now a variable
00:24 - just like in mathematics is something
00:27 - that holds a value now in our case that
00:29 - doesn't have to be just a number it
00:30 - could be a string it could be a boolean
00:33 - an integer like we're gonna talk about
00:35 - the different values and those are what
00:37 - are known as datatypes or objects so
00:41 - let's start by just creating a variable
00:43 - to create a variable we need to first
00:46 - figure out what type our variable is
00:48 - gonna be in this case I'm going to start
00:50 - with an integer and then we're going to
00:52 - go through all the different types and
00:53 - talk about the differences so to start
00:56 - we're gonna type int declaring that this
00:58 - variable that we're about to type out is
01:00 - going to be an integer we're then going
01:02 - to give a variable name now the variable
01:05 - name should contain typically just
01:07 - letters and underscores now I believe
01:10 - you can use numbers as long as it's at
01:11 - the end but our purpose we're not gonna
01:13 - do that when we create a variable name
01:15 - you have to make sure you do not use any
01:16 - spaces and you don't use any special
01:19 - characters as well so I'll go through a
01:20 - few examples of valid variable names and
01:21 - invalid variable names so a valid
01:23 - variable name for example could be hello
01:26 - that's valid because we don't have any
01:28 - spaces we don't have any special
01:30 - characters and there's no numbers and
01:31 - okay now an invalid variable name would
01:34 - be something like hello name okay this
01:37 - whole thing as our variable name is
01:39 - invalid because it contains a space now
01:42 - if I try to put like a what do you call
01:46 - it % like this or I try to put like an
01:48 - asterisks that is not a valid variable
01:50 - name so don't use any special characters
01:52 - you can end with an underscore you could
01:55 - start with an underscore if you want to
01:56 - but we're not going to be doing that in
01:58 - this case typically when you create a
02:00 - variable if you want to make a name be
02:02 - like two words the way you do it is you
02:05 - type like hello and then you would do a
02:07 - capital and then the next word or you
02:09 - would do an underscore representing a
02:10 - space
02:12 - then next word okay so that's enough
02:14 - about valid variable names not super
02:15 - important right now
02:16 - so I'm gonna create my first variable
02:18 - into hello world and that's gonna be
02:20 - equal to by participating an equal sign
02:22 - whatever integer I want so in this case
02:24 - I'm going to say five and then remember
02:26 - in Java whenever we end the line so this
02:28 - is just saying my integer HelloWorld is
02:30 - equal to five we need to terminate with
02:32 - a semicolon so there we go
02:34 - and we see we get int our variable name
02:36 - is now highlighted in yellow and there's
02:39 - no issues so if I hi let's just see what
02:41 - it says this very is never used
02:43 - okay that's fine so we've officially
02:45 - created a variable the variable name
02:48 - hello world now points to the integer
02:51 - five so to prove this to you I am simply
02:55 - going to print out the value of hello
02:57 - world like this okay I'm gonna say
03:01 - system dot out its a comma isn't it
03:04 - system.out.println and what we're gonna
03:07 - do is we're gonna say okay so hello
03:08 - underscore world that's our variable
03:11 - name and that variable holds five so
03:14 - when we print this we should be printing
03:15 - five the way this works in the computer
03:17 - right is it says okay hello world let's
03:19 - see where hello world is it's up here
03:21 - alright hello world is equal to 5 so we
03:22 - print that ok so there we go and we get
03:25 - 5 printed down here in the bottom of the
03:27 - screen now I want to show you something
03:29 - quickly and this is just gonna go this
03:31 - is a really important fundamental thing
03:32 - a lot of people don't talk about in
03:33 - programming tutorials and it's kind of
03:36 - like order of operations or execution so
03:38 - I am going to now put my variable
03:41 - underneath my system dot out dot println
03:45 - ok so I'm first gonna print hello world
03:47 - and then I'm gonna set hello world is
03:49 - equal to 5 hopefully you guys have
03:52 - realized what the issue might be here if
03:54 - not I'll talk about it really quickly
03:56 - and the problem is that I am trying to
03:59 - print the value of hello world before
04:00 - I've declared it because the in
04:03 - programming the way things work is
04:04 - unless you otherwise specify we're gonna
04:07 - be reading from top to bottom and left
04:10 - to right just the way you'd read a book
04:11 - right so we first read this line system
04:14 - dot out dot println a hello world and
04:16 - then we create hello world so here we
04:19 - don't know what hole the world is so if
04:21 - we try to do this you can see it warns
04:24 - me there's an error
04:25 - okay you know what there's Nair let's
04:26 - proceed anyways and you can see that
04:28 - down here we get a bunch of red text and
04:29 - it says we call it hello world cannot be
04:33 - resolved to a variable because we
04:35 - haven't yet declared that variable so we
04:38 - have to make sure whenever we're
04:39 - referencing or using variables that we
04:41 - first have them declared somewhere above
04:44 - our like the line that we're using them
04:47 - in okay so there we go we've created a
04:49 - variable hello world we print that to
04:51 - the screen now let's create a few
04:53 - different variables and talk about what
04:55 - these types are so in case I didn't
04:56 - really specify int stands for integer
04:58 - and that pretty much stands for any
05:01 - number that does not have a decimal
05:03 - point so as soon as I put a decimal like
05:05 - this like 5.0 this actually becomes a
05:08 - new data type and that data type is
05:10 - called a float now float stands for a
05:13 - floating decimal point which means any
05:15 - number that has a floating decimal point
05:17 - so I'm going to say float
05:19 - let's see num2 is gonna be my variable
05:23 - name is equal to and in this case I'm
05:25 - going to say 5.0 what's the issue here
05:30 - add casts from double to okay one second
05:33 - where is it double okay sorry I made a
05:35 - mistake there we're just gonna type
05:36 - double here as the name okay not float
05:38 - don't worry about float right now we'll
05:40 - talk about that later so anyways we have
05:41 - double num 2 equals 5.0 now double is
05:45 - exactly what I was explaining before
05:46 - anything that has a floating decimal
05:48 - point so even though this is still the
05:50 - exact same values this in terms of
05:52 - mathematics because it has a floating
05:54 - decimal point in our computer isn't
05:56 - referenced as a double okay now there's
06:01 - some other data types as well that we're
06:03 - gonna talk about so we have int we have
06:05 - double we also have something called
06:06 - boolean now boolean is true or false and
06:11 - these are gonna be really important in
06:12 - the next few videos that we talked about
06:13 - so boolean I'm just gonna say B as my
06:16 - variable name is going to be equal to
06:18 - and in this case I'm going to say true
06:20 - and again make sure I'm putting my
06:22 - semicolon now there's only two values
06:24 - that a that your a boolean data type can
06:28 - have that is true or false
06:31 - now why these are important is because
06:33 - based on the value of a boolean type
06:35 - we're gonna be doing things later in our
06:37 - program
06:38 - like if B was equal to true we're gonna
06:39 - print something otherwise we won't print
06:40 - something so that's really important
06:42 - another data type that we have is known
06:45 - as char now char is any character okay
06:50 - so this is a little bit different from
06:52 - string that I talked about in the last
06:53 - video but I'm going to talk about string
06:54 - as well so I'm gonna say char C is equal
06:57 - to and whenever we create a character
06:59 - there's two ways that we can do it we
07:01 - can do it with Unicode which you
07:02 - probably don't know what that is or we
07:04 - could do it with single quotation marks
07:06 - so by just simply hitting the single
07:08 - quotation marks we can put one letter in
07:10 - the single quotation marks and that is a
07:12 - character because that's what char
07:13 - stands for a character so like something
07:15 - on your keyboard in quotation marks now
07:18 - a character could be for example 9 in
07:21 - quotation marks so that's still a valid
07:22 - character because it's in quotation
07:25 - marks it's different than the number
07:26 - like 9 if you're if I were to type that
07:28 - up here ok so any letter or character
07:32 - that goes in quotation marks is a char
07:35 - now we have to be careful because chars
07:38 - can only be one one character if I try
07:40 - to do like 0 3 you can see that we're
07:42 - getting read text and job is yelling at
07:44 - us and it's saying no that's not allowed
07:45 - because we can only have one thing all
07:48 - right now I just want to show you I want
07:50 - to go over again really quickly what the
07:51 - main differences between this 9 and this
07:54 - 9 up here we've declared we're gonna
07:56 - have an integer name Tolo world and it's
07:59 - set equal to 9 okay that's what it is
08:01 - this is a character and since this is in
08:04 - quotation marks this is not the same
08:06 - thing as 9 the way like the datatypes
08:08 - really do matter in this sense okay so
08:11 - I'm just gonna change this back to like
08:13 - H something for now ok char c equal to H
08:16 - so that is extremely important now
08:19 - string this is another data type it's a
08:21 - different kind of data type which we'll
08:23 - talk about in a second but to make a
08:24 - string we do string I believe with a
08:26 - capital we'll see and then we give a
08:30 - name so for our variable in this case
08:31 - I'm gonna say STR is equal to and then
08:35 - at this time for a string we used double
08:37 - quotation marks okay and I'm just gonna
08:39 - say Tim in here so chars single
08:42 - quotation marks and strings are double
08:45 - quotation marks okay and strings can
08:47 - contain anything in them so I could have
08:49 - like six seven and three
08:51 - underscore star that's a completely
08:53 - valid string we can put any characters
08:56 - as long as they're with inside of these
08:58 - quotation marks okay same thing with the
09:00 - character if you put a nine in a string
09:02 - this is different than a nine like this
09:04 - okay so these are our main datatypes
09:08 - there are a few other ones but I'm not
09:10 - going to go into them right now because
09:12 - they they're a bit more complex than
09:15 - then we can handle right now so pretty
09:17 - much though you might notice that this
09:19 - string is highlighted as a different
09:21 - color than these and see int as orange
09:24 - doubles Orange boolean's Orange chars
09:25 - Orange
09:26 - why is string blue now the reason it's
09:29 - blue it's because it's a different type
09:31 - of data type these four dog types I
09:34 - talked about up top here are known as
09:37 - primitive and wow I really just did that
09:41 - I'm used to typing Python primitive data
09:43 - types okay and what that stands for is
09:46 - not changeable okay and we're gonna talk
09:49 - more about primitive data types and not
09:51 - primitive data types later on but just
09:53 - know that these ones I talked about here
09:54 - are known as primitive in Java and this
09:57 - one is not primitive okay so anyways
10:01 - let's just see now torrenting out like
10:04 - some of these data types like what we
10:05 - get when we print them to the screen
10:06 - right so if I print for example C to the
10:08 - screen well you should guess what we're
10:10 - gonna get we get H cuz that's C if we
10:13 - print STR we get 9 and so on now last
10:19 - thing I want to show you with variables
10:20 - is that we can actually make variables
10:22 - equal to other variables and we can add
10:24 - variables and we can subtract variables
10:26 - and this we're gonna be doing a lot in
10:27 - the next video but I want to just
10:28 - quickly introduce you so for example I
10:30 - want to create a new integer K let me
10:32 - say new integer and I'm gonna call it
10:34 - let's just call it Tim why not now I
10:37 - want this integer to be equal to 9 okay
10:40 - but I don't want to type nine out what
10:42 - I'm gonna do is I'm actually gonna type
10:44 - hello on your screen
10:46 - underscore world like this now what
10:49 - we've essentially done is we've taken
10:51 - the value from hello world and we've
10:52 - assigned it to Tim so now if we were to
10:55 - print Tim to the screen we get the value
10:58 - 9 now if I want to print hello world to
11:02 - the screen
11:04 - you can see that we are still getting
11:06 - the value of nine so now Tim points to
11:09 - hello world which points a nine right so
11:11 - Tim is equal to nine and hello world is
11:12 - equal to nine and we can do that and we
11:15 - can add variables together we can
11:16 - subtract variables we can do all kinds
11:18 - of cool things and that's really the
11:20 - point of variables right so we just have
11:22 - to make sure when we're doing this for
11:23 - example that we don't do something like
11:24 - this string Tim equals hello world you
11:29 - can see here now it says cannot convert
11:31 - from int to string because the data type
11:33 - string is obviously not the same as nine
11:35 - so we can't do that until we learn about
11:37 - something called typecasting which will
11:39 - be in a future video so anyways that has
11:41 - been it for this video I hope you now
11:44 - understand what variables are how they
11:46 - work and how we can create them in Java
11:49 - in the next video we're gonna be talking
11:51 - about operations so adding variable
11:53 - subtracting dividing doing stuff like
11:55 - that and then we'll be moving on to some
11:57 - more advanced stuff as always if you
11:59 - guys liked the video please make sure
12:00 - you leave a like and subscribe to the
12:02 - channel I will see you again in the next
12:03 - one
