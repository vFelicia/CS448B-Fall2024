00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:03 - YouTube video so in today's video I'm
00:05 - continuing with my pot game programming
00:07 - series and we're gonna be moving on to
00:09 - the ninth tutorial so in this tutorial
00:11 - what I'm gonna be showing you is how to
00:13 - add sound effects and how to add music
00:16 - and we're also going to do the collision
00:18 - between the two characters so just as we
00:20 - have the bullets colliding with our our
00:23 - goblin and we have little health bar
00:25 - going there now we're gonna have our man
00:26 - colliding with our goblin and we're
00:28 - gonna have something happen when well
00:30 - when they collide so what I want to
00:32 - start with is the sounds so in PI game
00:35 - we're able to have something called
00:36 - music and then sound effects so the
00:39 - music is gonna continually play in the
00:40 - background and our sound effects are
00:43 - gonna play when we call them so I just
00:45 - want to show you to start here I'm going
00:46 - to get my my folder here that I store my
00:49 - game in I've downloaded a few sound
00:51 - effects here so I have these two dot wav
00:55 - files so this bullet and this hit and
00:58 - then I have where's the other one here
00:59 - this is my music dot mp3 so in PI game
01:03 - the sound effect files have to be dot
01:05 - wav and your music files can be either
01:08 - WAV or mp3 now what we're going to be
01:13 - doing here is we're just gonna pretty
01:14 - much have it all around the program so
01:17 - that whenever you shoot the bullet
01:18 - you're gonna hear a sound effect and
01:20 - then whenever the bullet hits the go of
01:21 - them you're gonna hear the sound effect
01:22 - and then in the background I'm gonna
01:23 - have music playing the whole time so
01:26 - let's get started with that if you guys
01:28 - want to download those files that I just
01:30 - showed you go ahead and go down in the
01:32 - description below and click on the link
01:33 - it says github and then there's a link
01:35 - and on the github there it'll have all
01:38 - my all my files so I'll even have this
01:40 - tutorial file that once this is done be
01:42 - and finished and you guys can download
01:44 - all the images and all the music and all
01:47 - the stuff from there so first what we
01:49 - need to do is you need to load in our
01:51 - sound so just like we load in our images
01:52 - at the top here we're gonna create a new
01:54 - variable I'm going to call mine bullet
01:56 - sound and what we need to do here now
01:59 - it's just PI game dot mixer dot sound
02:04 - now inside of here all we're gonna do is
02:07 - just type the name of our sound effect
02:09 - so mine I called bullet wav
02:13 - straightforward pretty easy the next one
02:16 - we're gonna be doing is we have to do
02:17 - the hit sound so I'm just gonna do hit
02:19 - sound equals PI game dot mixer dot sound
02:25 - and then in here we just put hit dot WAV
02:31 - now for our music it's slightly
02:34 - different but it's still similar so I'm
02:35 - just going to label my music make this
02:38 - equal to PI game dot mixer dog music dot
02:43 - load like that and then in here same
02:46 - thing the name bar file so I think I
02:48 - called my music dot mp3 all right so now
02:52 - to play our sounds all we need to do
02:54 - it's very very easy it's just the name
02:57 - of the sound so whatever we have our
02:58 - variable called here don't play like
03:00 - that and then when you do that it's
03:02 - gonna play the sound however long it is
03:05 - and yeah it's pretty straightforward for
03:07 - the music to play our music continuously
03:09 - what we need to do is need to do PI game
03:12 - dot mixer dot music dog play I believe
03:18 - and then in here negative one let me
03:20 - just check to make sure that's right
03:21 - it's something along the lines of that
03:24 - yeah so that's exactly how you do it PI
03:26 - game mixer dot music play and this
03:29 - negative one here is gonna continuously
03:30 - play it so even when the song ends I
03:32 - think mine is like three minutes it's
03:34 - just gonna continue they play alright so
03:36 - we've got our sounds loaded in now it's
03:38 - time to play the sound so our bullet
03:40 - sound we're gonna play whenever we shoot
03:41 - the bullet so we're gonna scroll all the
03:42 - way down here until when we're hitting
03:43 - this space bar which should be shooting
03:45 - our bullet here I'm just gonna do bullet
03:48 - sound table play and then when our call
03:53 - band gets hit we're gonna play that hit
03:54 - marker sound so I'm just gonna do it in
03:55 - here I'm gonna do hit sound door play
04:02 - like that and there we go so now if I
04:05 - run the program here hopefully you guys
04:07 - can hear it it's not too loud for you
04:08 - you can hear the music in the background
04:11 - and then what I'm shooting my bullet you
04:12 - should hear that sound and when we hit
04:14 - the gold when you hear that sound as
04:15 - well now the sounds are slightly delayed
04:18 - but it's nothing to worry but we can fix
04:20 - that in another video it's nothing that
04:22 - I'm too concerned about right now okay
04:23 - so now we've got the music in
04:25 - defects that's pretty easy let's move on
04:28 - to the two characters colliding with
04:29 - each other so before I even go into this
04:32 - loop and start doing the collision like
04:33 - we did with the bullets I want to add a
04:36 - new method to our player character or to
04:38 - our player class so our player class if
04:40 - your members at the top of the program
04:41 - here what I'm gonna do is I'm just going
04:44 - to define and just like we had with
04:46 - goblin I'm gonna define hit as a new
04:49 - method so this is what's gonna happen
04:50 - when our goblin is hit so I want to
04:52 - start with this or when our player
04:54 - collides with the Goblin story so you
04:57 - guys can do whatever you'd like in this
04:58 - class personally what I'm gonna do is
05:01 - just how my character gets reset so he's
05:03 - gonna move back over to the left side of
05:05 - the screen I'm just gonna subtract 10
05:07 - from our score so if you remember in the
05:09 - last tutorial in the top right hand
05:10 - corner I have our score and that just
05:12 - goes up as you hit the Goblin pretty
05:15 - easy so to do this what I'm gonna do
05:18 - first of all is just change my
05:20 - character's x and y now our X I'm gonna
05:25 - set equal to 60 in the Y I believe I
05:28 - started out 410 so we're gonna leave him
05:29 - on the same plane now after we reset
05:32 - that what we also need to reset is his
05:35 - walking so that it doesn't look like
05:37 - he's like mid stride as he gets reset so
05:40 - walk count equals zero not wall count
05:43 - walk count like that and there we go
05:48 - and now what I want to do after I reset
05:50 - him is I want to have a pause so maybe
05:53 - for about a second where it shows on the
05:56 - screen what just happened so you got
05:57 - some feedback rather than our character
05:59 - just flying over to the left and nothing
06:01 - else happening I want to pop up on the
06:03 - screen saying like negative 10 from
06:06 - score like you got hit so to do this
06:08 - just like we drew text on the screen
06:10 - before I'm gonna create a new font
06:11 - object to create font 1 equals PI game
06:15 - dot font s sys font and here we're just
06:20 - gonna use Comic Sans m/s again or Comic
06:23 - Sans we'll use and then we'll have a
06:25 - size let's do 100 this time because
06:28 - gonna be fairly large now we're gonna
06:30 - render a text object here so it's gonna
06:31 - be say text equals font 1 dot render and
06:35 - then I'm just gonna do negative 10 like
06:38 - just showing you simply that you've just
06:40 - lost ten points you know what maybe
06:41 - we'll make it five tens a little bit
06:43 - much one and that our color in this case
06:46 - it's gonna be just red because red is
06:48 - bad you got hit and then we're gonna
06:50 - draw that on the screen so wind up lit
06:52 - and then in here we're just gonna put
06:57 - text comma and then now what I'm gonna
07:01 - do is I want to draw it in the very
07:02 - center of the screen so okay I'm gonna
07:05 - give you a second to think about how I
07:07 - would do this using just a little bit of
07:08 - math rather than hard coding a number
07:11 - and how would we get this to go in the
07:13 - middle of the screen
07:15 - okay so I've given you a second pause
07:17 - the video if you still want to continue
07:18 - thinking about it the way that we do
07:20 - this is by taking the width of the
07:22 - screen so if the width of our screen say
07:24 - for example is this like this long we
07:27 - divide it by two so now we're in the
07:28 - middle of our screen right here so this
07:30 - is where we are if the if this line of
07:32 - text is our screen then what we need to
07:34 - do is we need to find the width of our
07:36 - text object and we need to divide that
07:38 - by two so that we done know our
07:40 - x-coordinate because of our text object
07:41 - is this long then we needed starting X
07:44 - to be over here right we can't just put
07:46 - it in the middle of the screen otherwise
07:46 - the width of the text is gonna continue
07:48 - to move over and you'll see what I mean
07:50 - here so what I'm gonna do is I'm just
07:52 - gonna take our number the width
07:53 - restrooms just 500 I'm gonna divide it
07:56 - by two so that gives us 250 so you can
07:58 - either leave like that you can just
07:59 - write 250 and then you're gonna subtract
08:02 - from that I just like to put in brackets
08:04 - just to make it easier to see here we're
08:07 - gonna do text dot get underscore width
08:11 - this is a built-in method in my game so
08:15 - you can use this on any text object
08:16 - divided by two so that should put it
08:19 - right in the middle of the screen for us
08:21 - and then for the y coordinate you guys
08:23 - can decide if you want to do the same
08:25 - thing here with the y coordinate to put
08:26 - it in the middle of the screen or you
08:28 - can just type in a number I usually just
08:29 - put like 200 since the width for our
08:31 - screen is 480 so then it's gonna show up
08:34 - near the middle if you want to do the
08:35 - same thing here just substitute this
08:38 - with whatever the height of your screen
08:39 - is and then dot get height and it'll do
08:42 - the same thing for you and put in the
08:43 - middle then we're gonna do PI game dot
08:46 - display dot update like that and then
08:50 - after this what
08:51 - to do is I want to pause so if I had
08:53 - just do this what's gonna end up
08:55 - happening is we're gonna see negative
08:56 - ten flash on the screen really quickly
08:58 - and then it's gonna disappear so I want
09:00 - to pause for a certain amount of time so
09:01 - it gives the second for the user to see
09:03 - what's actually happened so I'm going to
09:04 - set a variable I'm going to set this
09:05 - equal to zero I equals zero and say well
09:09 - I is less than 100 like that and then in
09:13 - here I'm gonna do pygame dot time dot
09:18 - delay and then we're gonna put ten right
09:22 - there so if you do the quick math you're
09:25 - what's gonna end up happening is after
09:27 - our increment I otherwise we're gonna be
09:29 - stuck in an infinite loop there is every
09:31 - time that we go through this while loop
09:33 - we're delaying ten seconds so if we do
09:35 - 100 times 10 this isn't second-story
09:38 - this is like a thousand is one second so
09:41 - 0.1 milliseconds maybe and we're going
09:44 - to be multiplying by this so we should
09:46 - delay for a decent one time you know
09:47 - what I'm actually just gonna make this
09:48 - like three hundred to make sure we see
09:50 - it on the screen and then in here as
09:52 - well I want to make sure that while
09:54 - we're delaying we can still exit out of
09:56 - our screen so if I leave this delay then
09:58 - you'll see what happens is for like one
10:00 - or two seconds that it's on the screen
10:01 - if I try to click the X button it's not
10:04 - going to it's not gonna work it's gonna
10:05 - wait until the delay is done and then
10:07 - it's gonna work
10:08 - but I don't want that I want us to still
10:10 - be able to exit the game so I'm gonna do
10:11 - for event in PI game dot event get and
10:18 - I'm just gonna do if event type equals
10:22 - equals PI game don't quit same thing
10:24 - we've done down below and one of the
10:26 - first tutorials we're just going to say
10:27 - I equals 301 and then we're gonna say PI
10:33 - game dot quick like this alright so now
10:38 - we've done that we've created our method
10:39 - what we need to do now is the collision
10:42 - between our goblin and our character so
10:45 - we're gonna go down here and if you
10:47 - remember we've already done collision
10:48 - between the bullet and the goblin so
10:50 - what I'm gonna do here just to save us a
10:52 - bit of time is I'm just gonna copy this
10:54 - whole little statement I have here ctrl
10:56 - C and then at the top of our program I'm
10:59 - gonna paste it in like that
11:01 - now the indentation might be a little
11:03 - bit off
11:04 - it's not too hard to fix there we go and
11:07 - I'm just gonna start replacing all my
11:09 - bullet with with my man so for our first
11:13 - line what we're gonna do here is we're
11:15 - just gonna start with man and now
11:18 - remember we're not gonna use why we're
11:19 - gonna use the hitbox because that's what
11:20 - we've already defined as the correct
11:22 - coordinates for our four hip locks for a
11:24 - new man doll one we don't need this
11:26 - radius anymore because that's already
11:28 - the furthest left position and then here
11:30 - we're gonna do man dot hitbox and again
11:35 - it's gonna be one plus on the radius man
11:39 - dot hitbox and this is gonna be three
11:43 - that's our last coordinate our height
11:45 - same thing here with the we're gonna
11:49 - just do man dawn hitbox zero I'm gonna
11:54 - say plus man dot hitbox2 that's gonna be
12:01 - our width I get a space here fix that
12:04 - and then here we're it's the same thing
12:07 - we're just gonna replace this all with
12:09 - man dot hitbox zero now that should be
12:13 - everything so now inside here we're not
12:16 - gonna have hit sound play because we
12:19 - don't have a sound effect for one the
12:20 - two collide right now so we're gonna get
12:21 - rid of that and then instead of goblin
12:23 - dot hit it's gonna be man dot hit and
12:25 - our score we're gonna subtract would I
12:28 - say five and then we're gonna get rid of
12:30 - this over here now we can run our
12:33 - program and see if everything is working
12:35 - and there we go you can see we have our
12:38 - sound effects going maybe you thought
12:40 - you probably hearing it comin to my
12:41 - speaker here and we have pretty good
12:43 - collision you can watch here there we go
12:46 - so obviously it's not perfect but that's
12:48 - the best view yet and you can see it
12:50 - delays on the screen for a few seconds
12:51 - now I will note I will let you guys know
12:54 - that depending on
12:55 - fast your computer is the delay is gonna
12:57 - be different so you can see my delay is
12:59 - about one two three about three or four
13:03 - seconds I fear on a slower machine it's
13:05 - probably gonna be longer and the reason
13:07 - for that is if I come back up to this
13:09 - line over here these we're just using a
13:11 - while loop right so it's pretty much how
13:13 - quickly our while loop can go through
13:16 - all 300 of these iterations so yes we do
13:20 - delay inside of it but with having
13:23 - iterations like this it's gonna be
13:25 - slightly off it's not a perfect timing
13:27 - mechanism I just using this to show you
13:29 - a way that you can delay the game
13:31 - without delaying controls and you know
13:33 - what I mean if you ever tried to lay the
13:35 - game by just using this say for example
13:37 - if we just did delay 1000 and then I
13:40 - clicked with my left mouse button then
13:42 - when the delay was over the mouse left
13:45 - mouse button would click so even if I
13:47 - wasn't clicking it at that point it
13:49 - would send the command to the computer
13:50 - saying it was clicked and you're gonna
13:52 - see weird stuff happening with your game
13:53 - all right so that's been the ninth
13:55 - tutorial in my PI game programming
13:58 - series if you guys did enjoy please make
14:00 - sure you leave a like and subscribe and
14:01 - I'll see you again in the next and last
