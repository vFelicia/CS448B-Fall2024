00:00 - hello everybody and welcome to the
00:02 - second official
00:03 - tech with tim code jam project showcase
00:06 - what i'm going to be doing in this video
00:07 - is showcasing the top projects that were
00:09 - submitted in a recent coding competition
00:11 - that i've been running
00:12 - and then i'm going to be picking and
00:14 - announcing the top three winning teams
00:16 - if you are on one of those teams don't
00:18 - worry i will reach out to you guys
00:19 - afterwards
00:20 - and we'll talk about how you can claim
00:22 - your prizes but for this video i'm just
00:24 - going to be going through some really
00:25 - awesome projects that you guys have
00:26 - built
00:27 - kind of giving my reactions to them and
00:28 - then of course announcing my three
00:30 - favorite ones now just to give you guys
00:32 - some context here
00:33 - all of the information relating to
00:35 - future code gems and just all of the
00:37 - kind of stuff that i'm going to be doing
00:38 - that's external to the main youtube
00:40 - channel
00:41 - is in my discord server so if you guys
00:43 - want to be a part of these coding
00:44 - competitions
00:45 - you want to do weekly coding challenges
00:46 - you want to be a part of a minecraft
00:48 - server that's going to be coming soon
00:49 - probably in 2021
00:51 - and a bunch of other really awesome and
00:53 - cool things that i'm up to
00:54 - then join the discord server from the
00:56 - link in the description
00:57 - i will also mention that we have an
00:58 - official website that is used now for
01:00 - our code gems
01:02 - so if you want to see all of the
01:03 - submissions you want to see more details
01:05 - about this specific code jam and what
01:06 - goes on and kind of how this works
01:08 - then click the link in the description
01:10 - the official url is twt
01:12 - codejam.net although we may be changing
01:14 - that in the future either way this url
01:16 - should still work so anyways that is
01:19 - enough for this
01:20 - introduction i'm really excited to get
01:21 - into these projects so let's go ahead
01:23 - and get started with the first
01:25 - project
01:28 - [Music]
01:34 - so before i get into the projects i want
01:35 - to quickly thank everybody that made
01:37 - this possible so first of all everybody
01:39 - that participated in the code jam a big
01:41 - thank you to you especially if you
01:43 - submitted a project
01:44 - and i hope you're going to be joining us
01:45 - in the next code jam which will be
01:47 - happening pretty shortly
01:48 - again all the information in the discord
01:51 - server another big thank you to all of
01:52 - the volunteers and my entire staff team
01:55 - on the discord server
01:56 - i'm very busy and i could not have
01:58 - gotten this done without them they
01:59 - actually developed this entire website
02:01 - that you're seeing right here
02:02 - and made it possible for us to have a
02:04 - really nice way to view all the
02:05 - submissions and handle the voting system
02:07 - which i'm going to talk about next
02:09 - so the way that i'm actually picking the
02:10 - top 10 projects here or actually have
02:12 - the top
02:13 - nine is by votes so since i cannot go
02:16 - through all of the different submissions
02:17 - myself
02:18 - we implemented a system that allowed
02:20 - people that participate in the code jam
02:22 - to actually vote on their top projects
02:24 - or their favorite projects out of all
02:26 - the ones that were submitted
02:28 - so the ones that have the top votes are
02:29 - pretty much all of the ones that i'm
02:31 - showing here
02:32 - there was a few ties and a few projects
02:34 - that i was not able to set up so
02:35 - unfortunately i had to remove them
02:37 - and i will quickly mention that the
02:39 - basic rules here were if i was not able
02:41 - to set up your project in under 10
02:43 - minutes or i had to download over a
02:45 - gigabyte of files
02:46 - i simply skipped your project i'm sorry
02:48 - but it was a requirement that it was
02:50 - easy to set up and if i couldn't set up
02:52 - in under 10 minutes
02:53 - then unfortunately i had to skip it so
02:55 - anyways i've got nine projects to show
02:57 - you so let's get into it
02:59 - all right so i have the first project up
03:01 - in front of me for each project i will
03:03 - link in the description the original
03:05 - github repository so you guys can check
03:07 - it out for yourself
03:08 - i will also show the contributors of the
03:10 - people who made this project based on
03:12 - their github username
03:13 - so i will all be up on the screen i
03:15 - won't explicitly mention it but of
03:16 - course you can see it
03:17 - there so this first project is called
03:20 - student portal and i'll quickly go
03:21 - through some of the features
03:22 - i have looked at a lot of these projects
03:24 - already because i had to make sure i
03:25 - could get them to run before i did this
03:27 - video
03:27 - uh but yeah just keep that in mind this
03:29 - is pretty much my initial reaction but
03:31 - there is you know
03:32 - some stuff that i have already seen
03:34 - first i'm going to go to settings and
03:35 - just mess with that so you can see
03:37 - history that's what i was doing
03:38 - previously
03:39 - but i can change the appearance so i can
03:40 - go to dark mode okay and go to rgb mode
03:43 - oh that's kind of cool it's like
03:44 - changing colors that's going to be hard
03:46 - to read so let's go to dark
03:48 - so i can go to custom as well let's
03:50 - leave it on dark i can change the screen
03:52 - transition let's go to fallout
03:54 - and let's go back oh okay that's kind of
03:56 - cool wikipedia let's just search up tim
03:59 - and see what we get okay get some
04:01 - references
04:02 - nice looks like that's working notebook
04:04 - uh let's see if i can add something
04:06 - let's go
04:07 - edit and then hello edit it's not
04:11 - working okay
04:11 - hello and hello my name
04:15 - is tim nice save okay looks like i can
04:18 - add another one
04:20 - sweet uh we already clicked that
04:22 - translation
04:23 - let's try hello to do we have a
04:26 - french here and there we go we get
04:29 - bonjour alright so that
04:31 - is indeed working that's cool uh let's
04:33 - go to books
04:34 - let's type one in let's go
04:38 - seven habits of and you guys probably
04:40 - know the rest let's see if that pops up
04:43 - seven habits of highly effective people
04:44 - nice okay i like the ui for this
04:46 - i can look at the description of the
04:47 - book i see the cover that's kind of neat
04:49 - even tells you the price i guess if it's
04:51 - listed and finally
04:53 - youtube you already know what i'm going
04:54 - to search here let's search tech with
04:56 - tim
04:56 - and let's see what we get we get a bunch
04:59 - of my videos and some secret button
05:01 - well it says do not click so i'm not
05:02 - going to click it anyways there we go so
05:04 - we have a bunch
05:05 - of my videos nice and that about and i
05:08 - guess it just tells you what this is
05:10 - made with and all that i'm not going to
05:11 - read through that
05:12 - nice okay so this was built in kibi i
05:14 - did see that on the repository
05:16 - impressions looks really good really
05:18 - cool i like the ui and it's pretty
05:20 - impressive that they made this entire
05:21 - app using
05:22 - only python so i will give them props
05:24 - for that
05:25 - all right so this next one is called
05:27 - homework management now i will tell you
05:29 - that i already have created an account
05:30 - here
05:31 - technically if i go to account you can
05:32 - see this is the account but if you
05:34 - didn't make an account it would have
05:35 - told you to do that when you try to go
05:36 - to this homework page
05:38 - but anyways i'll put the contributor up
05:39 - on the screen but let's go to homework i
05:41 - have an account already made
05:43 - and now let's go ahead and add one so i
05:45 - design an analysis of algorithms
05:47 - nice let's say that this is assignment
05:51 - two which is actually
05:52 - true i do need to finish this let's say
05:53 - i should
05:55 - probably do this tomorrow dot dot dot
05:59 - okay
05:59 - i guess i can pick one to do i actually
06:02 - don't know when it's due but let's just
06:03 - go with the 16th why not on monday
06:06 - and then i can mark it as finished or
06:08 - not now i'm going to leave it as not
06:09 - finished because it is not and let's add
06:11 - homework
06:12 - homework added okay sweet so now i have
06:14 - the homework added in
06:16 - here i guess i can mark it as finished
06:18 - or market not as finished
06:20 - let me go to account and it says okay
06:21 - unfinished homework this is what i still
06:23 - need to do
06:24 - let's mark it as finished and see what
06:26 - happens when i go to homework
06:28 - so it doesn't seem to update when i
06:29 - press this radio
06:31 - button so that's something to note there
06:33 - but other than that this is a pretty
06:35 - cool idea to track
06:36 - my homework and be able to keep track of
06:39 - what i need to do one because this is
06:40 - something that i definitely always
06:41 - forget about
06:42 - i actually usually write it on a
06:43 - whiteboard but it would be nice to have
06:44 - some kind of website so really cool idea
06:46 - cool concept and i trust that this works
06:49 - with adding more fields but i am a
06:50 - little disappointed that the finished
06:51 - button
06:52 - uh doesn't seem to be functioning as i
06:54 - as i navigate between the pages
06:55 - anyways awesome work and now let's move
06:57 - on to the next one
06:59 - and boom okay i'm signed in so you can
07:01 - see that i do have my logo up here
07:02 - so what does this say pay for courses we
07:04 - don't do that over here top
07:06 - 30 picks from us so from reading the
07:08 - readme and looking at this project
07:09 - it seems like what it does is pretty
07:11 - much just show you the best free courses
07:14 - on youtube
07:15 - now i need to search through here and
07:16 - make sure they've included some tech
07:17 - with tim ones okay sweet i have go
07:19 - laying on there
07:20 - tensorflow i made that one as well okay
07:22 - so they are not failing already because
07:25 - they included my stuff
07:26 - uh but this is really cool looks like i
07:27 - can click into one of these let's go
07:30 - learn more okay and boom brings us to
07:32 - the playlist on youtube awesome that is
07:34 - really cool okay let's go back
07:36 - uh let's search for something let's
07:37 - search for
07:39 - javascript see what's popping up here
07:41 - four results found
07:42 - jquery javascript electron and
07:45 - whatever that is i don't know how to
07:47 - pronounce that okay let's go to
07:48 - favorites uh seems like you haven't
07:50 - favored any courses
07:52 - press that icon okay sweet let's
07:54 - favorite this one
07:55 - and let's go to favorites and boom
07:57 - showed up okay nice so that is working
07:59 - suggest a course oh this is a really
08:01 - cool idea so i can
08:02 - put my email course title course url and
08:05 - i guess they'll
08:06 - manually review that and then decide if
08:08 - they want to put that on the site or not
08:10 - a little about page this is pretty cool
08:12 - and yeah i'm not going to go through
08:13 - this too much more but generally this
08:15 - looks
08:16 - really awesome this is just a really
08:18 - polished fully functioning website and i
08:20 - think the idea is really cool to kind of
08:22 - bookmark and keep track of your favorite
08:23 - courses and really easily find
08:25 - great resources online this fits the
08:28 - theme jam for sure which is for
08:29 - students and really just great job i'm
08:32 - pretty blown away by how awesome
08:34 - this website looks and just how
08:35 - everything is so kind of
08:37 - polished and looks really nice anyways
08:39 - that is it for
08:40 - this one awesome work guys i'm going to
08:42 - move on to the next one
08:43 - all right so this next one i have here
08:45 - is called polytask contributors will
08:47 - come up on the screen uh but from
08:49 - looking at the readme it looks like
08:50 - first of all i can change the theme here
08:52 - so auto light or dark
08:54 - and then i can add these widgets to this
08:56 - screen looks like i can resize them and
08:58 - i can drag them around
08:59 - as well and this is kind of like a
09:01 - dashboard i guess for myself
09:03 - that i can use as a student so i have a
09:04 - calculator i have a
09:06 - dictionary i have a timer and a clock
09:10 - okay and then what else do we have we
09:11 - have snake ah snake okay let's see if
09:14 - this snake game works
09:15 - oh it actually does okay that's sweet so
09:17 - i can literally play snake on my little
09:19 - school dashboard
09:20 - i don't know if that's going to make us
09:21 - too productive if we should have that on
09:23 - here but this is pretty cool that this
09:24 - works
09:25 - right in the dashboard and you guys can
09:27 - see me just failing to hit the thing
09:29 - okay great
09:29 - anyways we're going to end snake after
09:31 - that calculator let's make sure that
09:33 - works 4 divided by eight what did we get
09:36 - or was that a plus i guess that was a
09:38 - plus not divided
09:40 - uh nice okay looks like i can resize
09:42 - these okay sweet
09:44 - notes let's see hello my
09:47 - name is tim regular bold oh sweet okay
09:52 - and what about the timer okay so there's
09:54 - a clock
09:55 - there is a timer i guess i can pick that
09:57 - and then there's a stopwatch
09:59 - and that is functioning damn okay that
10:01 - looks really cool dictionary
10:03 - uh why is death the thing that's popping
10:05 - up there but let's try that
10:06 - and boom it gives me the definition okay
10:08 - that is really cool i really like this
10:10 - this is a unique idea i like the fact
10:12 - that i think can i add multiple things i
10:14 - can
10:14 - and what does this do oh that's the the
10:16 - color theme so yeah i can kind of make a
10:18 - nice like personalized little dashboard
10:20 - and if i was studying or something i
10:21 - guess i could have this up while i was
10:22 - writing notes or whatever it was that i
10:24 - was doing
10:24 - awesome let's move on to the next one
10:26 - all right so this next one is called the
10:28 - studentology the perfect place for
10:30 - students to learn nice i like the
10:32 - background
10:32 - already let's go to projects there's an
10:35 - about page there's a contact page
10:38 - as well okay so this is made by just for
10:40 - fun
10:41 - nice uh looks like i look at the source
10:43 - code there okay this is i guess the page
10:44 - we want to be on scientific calculator
10:47 - to-do list
10:47 - formula cheat sheet wikipedia search uh
10:50 - pomodoro timer is that how you say that
10:52 - i actually don't know how to pronounce
10:53 - that
10:54 - let's go to scientific calculator boom
10:56 - okay it's just regular scientific
10:58 - calculator
10:59 - make sure that works it does indeed
11:01 - to-do list
11:02 - okay let's add an item let's add hello
11:05 - to the list
11:06 - let's add do my homework
11:09 - to the list and let's make sure this
11:12 - does indeed work okay check it off oh
11:14 - that's nice like the little animation
11:15 - for that
11:16 - but let me go to the to-do list again
11:18 - and the items are gone okay i'm going to
11:21 - mark that down because the to-do list
11:22 - probably should be persistent
11:24 - but anyways that's cool formula cheat
11:26 - sheet looks like there's some different
11:28 - formulas on here
11:29 - basic formulas area volume squares cubes
11:31 - okay this is actually a really cool idea
11:33 - and pretty useful
11:34 - i definitely have used these formulas
11:36 - and forgotten about them many times
11:38 - let's go to more formulas okay take me
11:41 - there
11:42 - it was lagging a bit for me but i think
11:43 - that was just my computer uh
11:44 - trigonometry formulas let's have a look
11:46 - at these ones
11:47 - sine cosine tangent um
11:50 - co secant secant cotangent
11:53 - sides ratios okay that's really useful
11:55 - again i could definitely could have used
11:57 - that um back
11:58 - in the day uh let's go back to look at
12:01 - the physics formulas
12:02 - and wow okay they have everything
12:03 - projectile motion work and energy waves
12:06 - and motions definitely super useful
12:08 - i'm going to guess that these guys here
12:10 - are in the physics and maths based on
12:12 - them even knowing how to add these
12:13 - formulas here
12:14 - okay nice wikipedia search you already
12:17 - know what i'm gonna type here
12:18 - let's try it out and no i guess i'm not
12:20 - on wikipedia okay
12:22 - let's go to a different one uh pomodoro
12:24 - timer i'm probably really butchering
12:26 - that name but anyways
12:27 - and okay so it looks like there's short
12:29 - break which is
12:30 - five minutes i guess long break which is
12:33 - 15 and then
12:34 - work and it seems as though this bubble
12:36 - like fills up which is a really
12:38 - cool thing but this is a good idea and
12:40 - this is awesome there's a bunch of stuff
12:41 - in one website and this is a really cool
12:44 - project so that's all i'm going to look
12:45 - through for this one but i really do
12:47 - like the ui design i like
12:49 - the kind of stuff that you have here and
12:50 - just a really neat idea and awesome work
12:53 - let's move on to the next one all right
12:55 - so this one is just called pomodoro
12:56 - timer so we just saw an example of that
12:58 - in the last project but this whole
12:59 - application is just that
13:01 - looks like i can start the timer i like
13:03 - the nice like animation when it's
13:04 - popping up here
13:05 - i can reset it like i can go to settings
13:08 - and okay so i can pick
13:09 - i guess this is the amount of time that
13:10 - you're supposed to be working and then
13:12 - small break
13:14 - long break okay sweet and let's go to
13:16 - about
13:17 - this website is as is a functional and
13:20 - minimalistic
13:21 - pomodoro timer with the goal of helping
13:23 - you focus and be more productive okay
13:25 - nice
13:25 - you can read more about the method here
13:28 - let's click on that
13:29 - and nice okay so i guess i can read this
13:30 - after the video to understand what this
13:32 - means but cool the website looks really
13:34 - nice let's go back to it i do like the
13:37 - minimalist stuff and i feel like if i'm
13:38 - studying and i wanted to use this method
13:40 - this would be a great website to use
13:41 - there's not too much stuff going on
13:43 - i don't have the option of just pressing
13:44 - the short short break or the long break
13:47 - it forces me to do all of the work and
13:48 - then i guess those timers will start
13:50 - after that but of course i'm not gonna
13:51 - wait 25 minutes to figure that out
13:53 - so let's move on to the next one all
13:54 - right so this next project is called
13:56 - wise drinker this one seems pretty cool
13:59 - and from reading the description i guess
14:00 - it's meant to tell you what your current
14:02 - status is
14:03 - based on the amount of drinks that
14:05 - you've had
14:06 - now i'm actually going to go in the
14:07 - imperial system because i don't know my
14:09 - height and all those things
14:10 - in centimeters and i have gone through
14:13 - this app already so i know what it asks
14:14 - you for
14:15 - but it asks me for my weight my height
14:17 - and all this other stuff so i will put
14:18 - in
14:19 - some true information you guys can guess
14:20 - what is correct or not
14:22 - uh let's go with 150 for the weight what
14:24 - is your height in centimeters or
14:26 - inches uh now i don't know if that's
14:29 - asking like does it want me to put like
14:30 - five
14:31 - foot nine that is my height actually
14:32 - five nine does it want me to do that
14:34 - or does it want me to like put in the
14:37 - number of inches that
14:38 - is five nine uh probably the other way
14:41 - around
14:41 - i guess that's i guess that's going to
14:43 - be 69 inches
14:44 - and then how many hours since your first
14:46 - drink let's go with
14:47 - three hours since my first drink all
14:50 - right uh check if you ate before
14:51 - drinking i did okay let's submit
14:54 - it says our status is not even
14:56 - lightheaded normal
14:57 - is zero okay a blood alcohol level
15:00 - and we drank three hours ago or that was
15:03 - when our first drink was okay so now
15:04 - choose what you drink okay let's just go
15:06 - with
15:06 - liquor sure how many uh how much liquor
15:09 - did you drink in ounces let's go with
15:11 - six submit drink and it says our status
15:14 - is a bit dizzy this is the blood alcohol
15:16 - concentration
15:17 - and this is the time since you first
15:19 - drank okay this is cool that's neat and
15:21 - i guess this is just something to tell
15:22 - you relatively what your blood alcohol
15:24 - is going to be
15:25 - and then you could determine i guess if
15:26 - you were old enough if you should drive
15:28 - or not or what your status was or all of
15:30 - that so impressions on this one first
15:31 - thing the status thing uh
15:33 - kind of throws me off a little bit just
15:34 - because i feel like that's like how do
15:35 - you predict that
15:36 - um but cool idea i really like the fact
15:39 - that has the bac
15:40 - and just the ui is useful it works
15:42 - everything seems to be functioning
15:44 - i would say maybe it could have used a
15:46 - little bit of polishing up maybe some
15:48 - better colors or a nicer ui
15:49 - but generally really cool idea really
15:52 - nice app and awesome job let's move on
15:54 - to the next one
15:55 - all right so this next one is called
15:57 - snake lingo now there's actually a bunch
15:58 - of music playing right now i don't know
16:00 - if you guys can hear that or not in the
16:01 - recording
16:02 - uh but there is music playing and from
16:04 - reading the description of this one it
16:05 - was saying that what this was meant to
16:07 - do is teach you a new language or help
16:08 - you learn a new language by playing the
16:10 - game of snake
16:11 - so i'm going to go with one that i might
16:12 - actually be able to get some write on
16:13 - which is french
16:15 - and let's try this okay loading
16:18 - loading loading and fault all right what
16:21 - is that gonna be
16:22 - or foe sorry what am i saying fault i
16:24 - guess i found an l there
16:26 - um i honestly don't know what that is
16:28 - i'm gonna go with should
16:29 - looks like that was correct what is this
16:32 - one now uh
16:33 - sotunu uh let's see supported maybe
16:36 - that seems to make the most amount of
16:37 - sense it goes with the right letter
16:39 - okay and then what's this one uh
16:43 - yeah i'm gonna say it's probably this in
16:45 - the corner
16:47 - boom okay nice what's this attention
16:50 - i'm pretty sure that's warning let's see
16:53 - boom looks like that's right
16:54 - uh let's guess get one wrong and boom
16:56 - okay game over you learned zero words
16:58 - you got four correct
17:00 - learn towards zero snake length four and
17:02 - i guess i could play again
17:03 - okay so that is a cool app i don't have
17:05 - enough time to go through and test it
17:07 - out but that is really neat
17:08 - uh i wonder if it keeps track of your
17:09 - high scores and stuff that would be cool
17:12 - and generally just a cool idea and a way
17:13 - to guess to get people to learn new
17:15 - new words in a specific language
17:18 - all right so awesome work let's move on
17:20 - to the next one
17:21 - all right so this next project i have
17:23 - here is called quad i guess it's v1
17:26 - which is the test i guess for this code
17:28 - jam initial impressions
17:30 - looks pretty cool looks you know
17:31 - somewhat polished not you know the most
17:33 - modern ui in the world but if it works
17:35 - it works
17:36 - and i guess this is what it does so it
17:38 - organizes urls organize video conference
17:40 - joining links
17:41 - there's an editable to-do list and a
17:43 - quote every time you refresh the page
17:45 - now let me sign in i did actually create
17:47 - an account before this just to make this
17:49 - process faster
17:50 - so i've signed in and you can see that i
17:51 - have no links here i do have one task
17:54 - that i added
17:55 - and then video conferences i do not have
17:57 - any so let's go to video conferences
17:58 - let's add a conference name test
18:02 - url test and platform let's put on zoom
18:06 - add conference please enter a url oh so
18:08 - it does have some verification there
18:11 - www.test.com
18:13 - really that's you're gonna tell me that
18:14 - doesn't work okay let's try this one
18:20 - okay so it looks like it worked with the
18:21 - https i have my test i guess i can click
18:24 - into it
18:25 - and wow okay brings me to that url
18:28 - nice let me go home let's go to
18:31 - links let's add techwithtim.net as a
18:35 - link
18:36 - and we'll just make the link https colon
18:40 - slash tech with tim.net add url and when
18:42 - i click on that
18:44 - it brings us to a very slow loading
18:46 - techwithsim.net
18:48 - nice to-do list my to-do list item is
18:50 - still here so it doesn't seed save
18:52 - let's delete that i'll confirm the
18:54 - delete and awesome that
18:56 - looks to be working okay so that is a
18:58 - pretty cool app actually seems pretty
19:00 - useful to me and i like the fact that
19:01 - you have an account so that i can sign
19:03 - in and sign out from different computers
19:05 - i guess
19:05 - keep track of important links that i
19:07 - want to know like my website tasks of
19:10 - course and then video conferences
19:12 - all right so nice work and now i'm going
19:14 - to announce the
19:15 - three winners all right so i've picked
19:17 - the three winning teams i'm going to
19:19 - announce them
19:20 - now and then again i will reach out to
19:21 - you guys on discord privately to talk
19:23 - about how to claim
19:24 - your prize but i want to quickly mention
19:26 - that this was not an easy decision there
19:28 - was a lot of awesome projects here
19:30 - and please do not be disheartened if you
19:31 - were not chosen for the top three
19:33 - this is my bias these are the ones that
19:35 - i liked personally
19:36 - and well i'm sure some of you in the
19:38 - comments may disagree and i would love
19:40 - to hear in the comments down below which
19:41 - project was your favorite or what you
19:43 - liked about some of the other ones that
19:44 - were shown
19:45 - here so with that said i'm going to
19:47 - quickly mention some of the factors in
19:48 - my decision making
19:50 - so first of all i was considering how
19:51 - unique was this project was this
19:53 - something that was kind of out of the
19:54 - box
19:55 - different than what most of the other
19:56 - ones were or was this something that i
19:58 - could have came up with in you know 10
19:59 - or 15 seconds
20:00 - my next one was how functional and
20:03 - polished was this project
20:04 - so where all of the features actually
20:06 - working if i went to a web page where
20:08 - the ui buttons functioning all of that
20:09 - kind of stuff
20:10 - and then how polished was it did i feel
20:12 - like this was a finished project or did
20:14 - this feel like something that was rushed
20:15 - and kind of handed in in the last minute
20:18 - uh now that's pretty much all i
20:19 - considered of course
20:20 - another small few things as well like
20:22 - maybe the styling of the application or
20:24 - actually
20:24 - how complex it might be or what it
20:26 - actually accomplishes and what it does
20:28 - but generally that's what i looked at
20:30 - and with that i have my three winning
20:32 - teams
20:33 - now in third place we have polytask
20:36 - now i'm not sure what the team name of
20:38 - this is but i will throw it up on the
20:39 - screen so congratulations you guys came
20:42 - in third place the reason i chose this
20:44 - for third place is not because this
20:46 - project was something that had an
20:47 - overwhelming
20:48 - number of features and a bunch of
20:49 - different pages but i thought this was a
20:51 - really cool
20:51 - and unique idea and something that i may
20:54 - you know have potentially thrown up on
20:56 - my screen just like a widget dashboard
20:58 - while i was studying i thought this
20:59 - definitely went well with students i
21:01 - like the fact that you can customize the
21:03 - layout
21:03 - resize all of these different things and
21:05 - generally just something pretty unique
21:07 - and that's why i picked it for third
21:10 - place
21:11 - all right so that is our third place
21:13 - winner and now i'm going to go
21:15 - to second place and in
21:18 - second place i have student portal
21:21 - now the reason i picked this one for
21:22 - second place is because this was unique
21:24 - this was built in kivy almost all of the
21:26 - other ones were actually
21:28 - websites i like the fact that pretty
21:29 - much everything here was
21:31 - actually functioning it saved everything
21:33 - it worked well it looked like this was
21:35 - just really polished the ui
21:36 - is pretty great for something built
21:38 - solely in python in my opinion
21:40 - all of the features that i use worked
21:42 - pretty flawlessly there wasn't really
21:43 - any issues with them
21:44 - the about page was nice and then the
21:46 - settings page had just all these extra
21:48 - things that really made this feel like a
21:50 - complete app
21:50 - for example i can change the screen
21:52 - transition i can change the actual color
21:54 - maybe go dark mode or
21:55 - light mode i can look at the history of
21:57 - the things i've done i can clear that
21:59 - history i can turn it off
22:00 - just felt really polished really
22:02 - complete looked really great and i just
22:04 - thought generally
22:05 - was a really cool idea to do this in
22:06 - kivy add all these different things
22:08 - together
22:08 - and that is why i chose it so
22:10 - congratulations to whoever made this
22:12 - again i'll put the team name up
22:14 - on the screen you guys are the second
22:16 - place winner
22:17 - and now let's move on to the first place
22:20 - and now
22:21 - in first place we have as no surprise
22:24 - course yard now this was definitely my
22:26 - favorite project it was not hard for me
22:28 - to pick this as
22:29 - first place i just felt like the ui on
22:31 - this really blew me away and just
22:33 - honestly looking at the site this feels
22:35 - like something that i would see
22:36 - on just any other regular modern website
22:38 - i really appreciate the fact that they
22:40 - have the logos there's a lot of just
22:41 - small little attention to detail things
22:43 - just like the highlighting of little
22:45 - buttons
22:45 - um the fact that when i go over this it
22:47 - gets a little bit larger
22:48 - you know expanding the search bar just
22:51 - felt really nice i liked the fact that i
22:53 - could sign in with my google account
22:54 - that i have the change in colors
22:56 - and then i can favorite all of these
22:58 - different projects or sorry all these
23:00 - different courses i guess and that
23:01 - actually functions i can search for
23:03 - courses
23:03 - the idea itself is just really unique no
23:05 - one else really came up with something
23:07 - like this
23:08 - and of course this isn't really a factor
23:09 - in the decision but i appreciated the
23:11 - fact that some of my courses
23:12 - were actually included in this list like
23:15 - for example
23:16 - the golang tutorial so anyways that is
23:18 - all i'm going to say
23:19 - this was just really well done
23:20 - congratulations guys i believe these are
23:22 - the three authors right here i'm not
23:23 - even going to try to pronounce all of
23:25 - your names
23:26 - but congratulations you came in first
23:28 - place and i hope that you're going to
23:30 - participate in the next code jam and
23:31 - show us what you can do for another
23:33 - topic
