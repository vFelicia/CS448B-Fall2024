00:06 - the angle we're gonna have to use a bit
00:08 - of trig so I already have a function
00:10 - I've
00:10 - wrote here because I didn't want to have
00:12 - to do it on camera so I'm just gonna
00:15 - copy and paste it and I'm gonna go
00:17 - through it and give you as a second to
00:18 - copy it down so I'm just gonna paste it
00:20 - under here and it's called find angle so
00:23 - this is the function right here it
00:26 - pretty much takes a position and the
00:29 - position is well the position of our of
00:32 - our mouse and then vs. the golf ball so
00:37 - it already has a position the golf ball
00:39 - we just have to give it the position of
00:40 - the mouse and then what it does here is
00:42 - it tries to tangent the angle to figure
00:46 - or tangent the the golf balls X&Y to
00:50 - figure out the length of that line to
00:53 - start with right and if you can't do
00:55 - this so it can't arc arc tangent this
00:58 - then it's just gonna do math dot pi
01:00 - divided by two because the only time
01:02 - that math thought that this won't work
01:04 - is if it's if it's a certain value in
01:08 - radians so if you don't understand
01:10 - radians I'm gonna pull up a unit circle
01:11 - here quickly actually pretty much every
01:16 - degree has a Radian equivalent so 30
01:19 - degrees is PI over six 45 degrees is PI
01:22 - over four and you can look on here and
01:24 - so on you don't really have to
01:25 - understand exactly how they work or why
01:27 - we use them but in one full circle we
01:29 - have two pi radians 180 degrees is pi
01:33 - radians and so on so you're gonna see
01:37 - that I have some like math dot PI's and
01:40 - stuff in here that's just because that's
01:41 - the way radiance work you don't really
01:42 - have to understand them but here's unit
01:45 - circle anyways if you want to look at it
01:46 - so we'll close that out so let me just
01:48 - go over this again I think I messed it
01:50 - up so pretty much the arctangent is what
01:52 - we use in for radians to figure out the
01:55 - angle if we're given two positions in a
01:57 - right triangle so let me just pull this
01:59 - up for a second I'm steadily good 0 for
02:02 - now and so if we have a line like this
02:05 - then that means if we go directly down
02:07 - and we go directly across then we can
02:10 - find the two components of those lines
02:12 - so the x value and the y value now if we
02:15 - know those two components or those two
02:18 - lines the values there and we know that
02:20 - it's a right triangle
02:22 - then we can use those two components to
02:26 - figure out the angle here that would be
02:28 - down here to the line it's hard to show
02:30 - you because my mouse is what's creating
02:31 - the line but I hope you can understand
02:34 - that so we're gonna we try to do that
02:35 - now with the with the arctan tangent if
02:39 - that doesn't work then we're just gonna
02:41 - default to this because that would mean
02:43 - that the one case where it doesn't work
02:44 - is is this alright so now this is where
02:47 - we determine what direction we're
02:50 - actually shooting it so once we figure
02:52 - out the angle now we have to determine
02:54 - if we're shooting left if we're shooting
02:56 - right if we're going down if we're going
02:58 - down left just copy this down here don't
03:02 - exactly you don't have to worry exactly
03:04 - what it does this just figure out what
03:05 - quadrant your mouse is in so looking at
03:09 - the unit circle we have four quadrants
03:11 - just figures out what quadrants in so
03:13 - copy this down pause the video and then
03:16 - we're gonna move on to the rest here so
03:18 - what I'm just gonna do for angle isn't I
03:20 - do find angle and then we're gonna put
03:24 - pause in here and pause is gonna be
03:26 - again the position of our mouse like
03:29 - that alright so now we've got that part
03:31 - down and we're gonna find the angle
03:34 - we're gonna find the power and we're
03:36 - gonna set where we're shooting from now
03:38 - we have to get the physics involved so
03:40 - we've used all the math now with the
03:41 - trig now we have to use the physics to
03:44 - determine exactly where the ball is
03:46 - going to be moving and how far at what
03:48 - time so we're gonna go up here to the
03:51 - beginning of our function and we're just
03:52 - gonna do a new thing here we're gonna
03:54 - say if shoot like this so that means the
03:57 - ball is in motion we're shooting the
03:59 - ball then we are going to what we're
04:03 - gonna have to do is now check if the
04:06 - ball has already collided with the
04:07 - ground or not so we know if we should
04:08 - continue shooting it or if we should
04:10 - stop the ball so I'm just gonna say if
04:12 - golf ball dot Y is less than 500 minus
04:18 - golf ball dart radius so this just means
04:22 - that we've now gone past the bottom of
04:24 - the screen or we're about to go past the
04:26 - bottom of the screen we don't want to
04:28 - continue moving the ball because that's
04:29 - our ground so it's gonna hit there and
04:31 - then ideally it would bounce but that's
04:33 - gonna be in the next part of the video
04:35 - now we're just gonna do time plus equals
04:38 - 0.05 the reason I'm doing this is
04:42 - because that's gonna be the increment of
04:43 - time that makes it look like it's moving
04:45 - properly Kanna so 0.05 seconds is what
04:50 - that's gonna be P oh this is just gonna
04:52 - be position I just don't want to
04:54 - override this position here so I just do
04:55 - this and we're gonna do full dot ball
05:00 - path don't worry we're gonna go back up
05:04 - and fix that method we're just gonna
05:05 - plug this in for now we're gonna do XY
05:07 - power angle time like that now we're
05:13 - going to set our positions or change
05:14 - them for the golf ball so golf ball that
05:16 - x equals P o zero and golf ball dot y
05:21 - equals po1 okay so I know I went really
05:27 - fast let's recap here quickly
05:29 - so pretty much what happens here if the
05:31 - user clicks the mouse then we're gonna
05:33 - check to make sure he's not already
05:34 - shooting the ball if he is not we're
05:36 - gonna set shoot equal to true we're
05:38 - gonna determine where he had shot the
05:39 - ball at so wherever that golf ball is at
05:41 - that time we're gonna set time equal to
05:43 - zero so we're gonna reset that to make
05:45 - sure that it is at zero we're gonna do
05:47 - power we're gonna set the power based on
05:49 - the length of the line and we're just
05:50 - gonna divide it by eight so it's not too
05:52 - big of a number then we're gonna find
05:53 - the angle between our mouse and the ball
05:57 - now the way that we do that is by using
05:59 - this function that I've written in here
06:01 - again you don't have to understand how
06:03 - this works but just copy it out and then
06:06 - we now need to do this ball power so
06:09 - this ball path function is what's gonna
06:11 - use the physics to determine how the
06:14 - ball is gonna move through the air so
06:15 - let's get into this now and this is
06:18 - going to be kind of the end or the
06:21 - wrapping up part of the video now so
06:23 - we're just gonna start by doing this we
06:27 - need to find the two components of our
06:30 - movement so we have a X velocity and a Y
06:34 - velocity now the way that a ball moves
06:37 - in physics in two dimensions is each
06:41 - second it moves X by us X by a certain
06:44 - amount of degrees and it moves Y by a
06:45 - certain amount or not degrees a certain
06:47 - amount right
06:48 - so it can move X by five maybe and it's
06:50 - moving Y by two or it's moving X by
06:53 - seven and moving down Y by three so we
06:56 - need to figure out exactly how that is
06:58 - gonna work so now that we have the angle
07:00 - and the power we know the diagonal power
07:02 - but we have to know what the velocity is
07:05 - going to be going X and what the
07:06 - velocity is gonna be going Y so we'll
07:08 - figure that out now to do that we simply
07:11 - need to just do math or cosine and then
07:14 - of angle multiplied by our power and
07:17 - this gives us our X velocity and to find
07:20 - the Y velocity we just do map both sine
07:22 - of our angle and our angle is in radians
07:24 - by the way that's this is y in Python
07:27 - all the mouth stuff it uses radians
07:28 - unless you convert it into degrees and
07:30 - then we have math dot sine angle times
07:33 - power so that gives us our Y component
07:36 - so now we go down and we have to
07:38 - calculate how far we moved on the
07:41 - x-direction and how far you moved on the
07:43 - y-direction now the X Direction is easy
07:45 - because we're moving at a constant
07:48 - velocity right so there's no gravity
07:51 - moving left and right gravity only
07:52 - pushes us downward so the X Direction is
07:55 - easy we just do our velocity of x times
07:58 - our time so if say for example if you're
08:01 - moving five meters per second and you're
08:04 - it was two seconds into your motion then
08:07 - how far would you be you would be ten
08:08 - meters because you moved five meters per
08:10 - second right now our Y is a little bit
08:13 - more complicated now this is just a
08:15 - formula you can find us online it's
08:17 - motion with downwards acceleration so
08:20 - since our acceleration of gravity is
08:22 - negative 9.8 meters per second down we
08:26 - need to use that in this formula so
08:28 - we're just gonna start by doing valve Y
08:29 - times time plus now these brackets are
08:33 - very important so make sure that you do
08:35 - not forget them we're gonna do another
08:37 - set of brackets and now I know gravity
08:39 - is usually negative 9.8 meters per
08:41 - second squared but I like to set my
08:43 - gravity to about half of that just so it
08:45 - doesn't move down as quickly if you want
08:47 - to be more realistic you can change that
08:49 - number you can play with it all these
08:50 - numbers you can play with and it's just
08:54 - gonna give you a different kind of
08:55 - motion x squared divided by 2
08:59 - that so make sure you guys copy this out
09:02 - and it looks exactly like this otherwise
09:05 - it's not gonna work properly again you
09:07 - can change this number but not keep it
09:09 - the same and now we need to calculate
09:11 - our new X and our new Y so to do this we
09:15 - do new X is equal to and then we're just
09:19 - gonna round this here so we don't get
09:21 - crazy decimal numbers we're new distance
09:23 - X so that's how much we moved in the
09:25 - x-direction plus our initial starting
09:29 - direction our starting position and then
09:31 - remember in Python how moving positive
09:36 - actually moves you downwards rather than
09:38 - how you would think it works like if
09:40 - you're subtracting you go downwards so
09:42 - in this case we actually have to
09:44 - subtract to move upwards we're going to
09:47 - start Y minus and then our distance of y
09:51 - and then we're gonna return that value
09:54 - in a tuple let's go return new X and new
10:00 - Y again we went kind of fast there but
10:03 - that's how this works this is the
10:06 - physics that we're incorporating into
10:07 - this and that just gets our X component
10:10 - or Y component and then we can tell how
10:12 - to move our ball and this is exactly how
10:14 - projectile motion works now we're not
10:17 - really bothered about finding like the
10:18 - max distance or the max height we just
10:20 - want to display this on the screen so
10:23 - that we can see it if we wanted to
10:24 - figure that out that would be a
10:25 - different tutorial okay so we've done
10:27 - that now and let's just check the rear
10:30 - code and make sure that everything
10:32 - should be working so we have if shoot
10:34 - then we're gonna check to make sure that
10:36 - our ball is not shouldn't should be
10:39 - moving so it's not like below the screen
10:41 - then we're gonna move it we need to add
10:43 - one thing here which is so once our ball
10:46 - hits the ground or goes lower than the
10:47 - ground we need to stop moving so we're
10:50 - gonna shoot it goes false and we're
10:53 - gonna set its position so that we make
10:55 - sure it's able to shoot next time so
10:57 - it's higher on the ground reach go golf
11:00 - ball dot Y is equal to 494 and that's
11:05 - initially what we set it to here right
11:08 - and that should be about it so I'm just
11:12 - checking through here quickly make sure
11:14 - it looks good and I think it does so
11:17 - let's try this out okay so we have the
11:20 - line and let's see what happens when I
11:23 - click there we go and you can see the
11:26 - ball shoots around the screen now you'll
11:29 - notice this moves kind of fast right if
11:33 - we don't want it to move as fast there's
11:35 - a few things that we can do to fix that
11:38 - so the first thing we're gonna do to fix
11:40 - that is by changing this number here
11:42 - now this time is well exactly what it
11:45 - does by how much you increment it is how
11:47 - fast the program's going to go so if I
11:49 - change this to 0.01 and I run the
11:52 - program
11:52 - you'll notice that we go very very slow
11:55 - like that if I change it to for example
11:58 - 0.1 and I run it then we go really
12:03 - really really fast so you guys have to
12:05 - play around with this number it's gonna
12:07 - be different depending on your computer
12:09 - as well I know it seems weird but pretty
12:11 - much how fast your processor is is gonna
12:13 - determine how fast this while loop runs
12:15 - so there are a few things you can do to
12:17 - set exactly how fast the while loop runs
12:19 - but we're not gonna worry about that
12:21 - right now so just play with this time
12:23 - number
12:23 - I usually go anywhere from 0.01 to 0.1
12:27 - depending on how fast your computer is
12:29 - and you can see that 0.025 seems to be
12:34 - working well for me now the longer that
12:36 - your line gets the more that your ball
12:39 - moves so I hope you guys enjoyed this
12:42 - tutorial I know it's probably not the
12:44 - best I tried to go at a reasonable pace
12:47 - but again we can't spend too long going
12:49 - over everything this involves physics
12:52 - and involves math is pretty complex so
12:55 - if you guys understood it then give
12:57 - yourself a pat on the back and if you
12:59 - want to see the kind of next parts of
13:02 - the tutorial where we make our ball
13:03 - actually bounce off the ground then
13:05 - leave a like and leave a comment just
13:08 - saying you want to see it and I'll be
13:09 - sure to do that later on so yep thank
13:12 - you guys and I'll see you in the next
13:14 - video
