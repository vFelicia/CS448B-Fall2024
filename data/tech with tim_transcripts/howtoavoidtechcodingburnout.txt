00:08 - so as we all know the tech industry is
00:10 - extremely competitive and it's moving
00:12 - very quickly it feels like every day
00:14 - there's a new language framework or
00:16 - technology that you're expected to know
00:18 - and of course this can lead you to
00:19 - feeling burned out in fact it's a pretty
00:22 - common theme that people work really
00:24 - hard land a job at something like google
00:26 - or tesla or facebook or whatever it may
00:28 - be and then a few months later collapse
00:31 - because of the work the pressure and the
00:32 - stress that they're putting on
00:34 - themselves so in this video i want to
00:36 - share with you some things that work for
00:37 - me to avoid burnout and some things that
00:39 - you may want to consider if you're
00:41 - starting to feel a little bit depressed
00:43 - starting to feel down and you're losing
00:45 - some of that productivity and motivation
00:47 - that you once had when you were learning
00:48 - tech now this is not gonna work for
00:50 - everybody these are just things that i
00:52 - know work for me and when i'm starting
00:54 - to feel burned out i'm starting to get
00:56 - tired i like to remind myself of these
00:58 - list of points and usually this helps me
01:00 - get back on track and actually you know
01:02 - avoid the burnout that's kind of
01:03 - inevitable and coming if i continue down
01:06 - the same path that i'm on so hopefully
01:07 - these five tips help you avoid burning
01:09 - out but one thing you definitely should
01:11 - not avoid is the sponsor of this video

02:11 - thanks again to api layer for sponsoring
02:13 - this video so let's move on here to tip
02:16 - number one which is to not compare
02:18 - yourself to other people now this is a
02:20 - recurring theme this is something i see
02:22 - all of the time when i'm talking to
02:23 - people about burnout and that's that
02:25 - they're feeling depressed or demotivated
02:27 - because someone that they know or
02:28 - someone that they watch or look up to is
02:31 - better than they are or they feel like
02:33 - they're not at the same level or moving
02:34 - as quickly as someone that they may be
02:36 - idolized they look to as a role model or
02:38 - something along those lines now this
02:41 - always is just a negative thing to do to
02:43 - look at someone else that you really
02:45 - don't know very much about especially if
02:47 - they're an internet personality like me
02:49 - there's like so much stuff you guys
02:50 - wouldn't know about me uh just by
02:52 - watching my youtube videos right and to
02:53 - make a direct comparison and say you
02:55 - know me at 16 years old i'm not as good
02:57 - as this guy who's almost 22 has been
02:59 - programming for 10 11 12 years it's just
03:02 - not a fair comparison it's always going
03:03 - to have a negative effect on you and you
03:05 - really have to avoid doing that because
03:07 - the only real fair comparison is
03:09 - yourself right you can compare yourself
03:11 - to how good you were yesterday or six
03:13 - months ago or a year ago that's a fair
03:15 - comparison but to a complete stranger or
03:17 - someone else that you look up to
03:19 - especially if they're in kind of the top
03:21 - of a field uh it's just really not fair
03:23 - and it's not going to be doing you any
03:24 - benefit now another comparison a lot of
03:27 - people
03:27 - like to make is kind of the amount of
03:29 - work that other other people do versus
03:31 - the amount of work that they do right
03:33 - you may have someone look at me for
03:34 - example obviously i pride myself in
03:37 - working hard and posting a ton of videos
03:38 - you know putting in a lot of hours per
03:40 - day but that's not for everybody not
03:42 - everybody can do that and if you look at
03:44 - me and say oh you know tim works eight
03:45 - hours a day or ten hours a day and i
03:47 - only work six i feel bad about myself
03:49 - again that's not doing you any benefit
03:51 - and you don't know the side effects that
03:53 - may have on me you don't know why i'm
03:55 - able to do that maybe your lifestyle
03:56 - doesn't work for that it's just not a
03:58 - fair comparison and you really should
04:00 - not do that so i won't keep going on and
04:02 - on about this point i think you guys get
04:04 - the general idea here usually comparing
04:06 - yourself to other people especially
04:08 - again when they're kind of the top of
04:09 - the field or internet personalities or
04:11 - something like that is not going to be
04:13 - doing you any benefits the only person
04:15 - you should be comparing yourself to is
04:16 - yourself either last week or the day
04:19 - before or a month before etc and that's
04:21 - how you should be tracking your progress
04:23 - not based on how other people are
04:25 - learning stuff how quickly they're
04:26 - moving everybody's different everybody
04:28 - learns at a different pace the only fair
04:30 - comparison is with yourself alright so
04:32 - now we'll move on to tip number two
04:34 - which i'm going to summarize by saying
04:36 - taking a break can be productive now i
04:39 - know this seems obvious this is kind of
04:40 - a cliche thing that everyone says you
04:42 - know take breaks take breaks take breaks
04:44 - but what i want to emphasize here is
04:45 - that if you're someone who's hard on
04:47 - yourself constantly pushing yourself to
04:49 - do more work to kind of move forward and
04:51 - progress
04:52 - sometimes you forget about this point
04:54 - right that really the best thing you may
04:56 - be doing in a day or two days is just
04:59 - taking a break oftentimes i'm tired i
05:02 - don't want to work but my mind is kind
05:03 - of pushing me to do more and oftentimes
05:06 - when that happens i'm getting poor
05:07 - quality of work done i'm not being as
05:09 - productive or efficient as i can and i'm
05:11 - really just sitting at the computer kind
05:12 - of miserable wishing that i wasn't here
05:15 - but doing it because i feel like i have
05:17 - to in those scenarios i have to remind
05:19 - myself that sometimes it's really
05:21 - legitimate to take a break to lie in bed
05:23 - all day to go watch tv for a few hours
05:26 - to go hang out with friends to go
05:27 - outside whatever it is that you want to
05:29 - do sometimes that is legitimate and it
05:32 - can actually be very productive
05:34 - especially if you take that day
05:36 - break regenerate and then be ready the
05:38 - next day to work you know as hard as you
05:40 - want to to be as productive as you want
05:42 - to etc so that's really what i mean by
05:44 - this point is that you have to give
05:46 - yourself some leeway you have to give
05:48 - yourself a bit of forgiveness and
05:49 - realize that you know what it might be
05:51 - the best thing you can do today to just
05:53 - lay in bed to just relax to just take a
05:55 - break and then tomorrow get up and do
05:58 - all of the tasks that you wanted to
05:59 - complete i know for me that works really
06:01 - well when i'm feeling burned out i
06:03 - remind myself of this point i usually
06:05 - take a day or two off or i take at least
06:07 - an afternoon or something like that to
06:08 - do something fun and then i wake up the
06:10 - next day feeling much better i'm ready
06:12 - to work i'm no longer demotivated or
06:14 - depressed or whatever it may be and i'm
06:16 - happy that i took that day off and you
06:18 - know i don't really blame myself for not
06:21 - getting any work done in that day now
06:23 - the last thing i will say here is that
06:24 - you do have to be a little bit careful
06:26 - with this because you don't want to make
06:28 - this an excuse for not getting work done
06:30 - that you have to do right it can be
06:32 - really easy to take this to the extreme
06:35 - where every other day you're saying oh i
06:36 - need a break or every day you're saying
06:38 - i need to sleep in of course that's not
06:40 - what i'm talking about here it's really
06:41 - more of allowing yourself some
06:43 - forgiveness giving yourself some leeway
06:46 - and remembering at the end of the day
06:47 - that you are human and you're not able
06:49 - to work 24 7 sometimes you just need a
06:52 - break alright so moving on here to tip
06:54 - number three i have setting manageable
06:56 - goals now again i know a lot of this
06:58 - stuff seems obvious but i think
07:00 - sometimes you need to remind yourself of
07:02 - it and hear kind of in an articulated
07:04 - way why this is actually important to do
07:07 - so setting manageable goals one of the
07:09 - biggest
07:09 - issues i have with myself and that i see
07:11 - with other people is that when they get
07:13 - into programming or they want to learn
07:15 - something or finish something they kind
07:16 - of have this all or nothing approach
07:18 - where it's i'm going to program every
07:20 - day for eight hours or i'm not gonna
07:22 - program at all or in a different field
07:24 - i'm gonna get up every morning at seven
07:26 - a.m and work out or i'm not going to do
07:28 - any workout at all
07:29 - this is really bad really negative and
07:32 - pretty well impossible to maintain right
07:34 - even if you're really good and really
07:36 - dedicated it's very very difficult to do
07:38 - this all or nothing approach and
07:40 - oftentimes it just leads to a lot more
07:42 - negatives than if you were to have a
07:44 - manageable goal something that is a lot
07:47 - easier to obtain and that you can kind
07:49 - of build on once you hit these smaller
07:51 - goals that you're setting for yourself
07:53 - so to put this in the context of
07:54 - programming and give you some examples
07:56 - here i often times work on like large
07:58 - programming projects and i set the goal
08:01 - to finish it tonight or to finish it
08:03 - tomorrow or to do an entire feature or
08:05 - kind of sub system of the project very
08:08 - very quickly now usually i am capable of
08:10 - completing that but it gets to the point
08:12 - where i'm rushing i'm pushing myself i'm
08:15 - really exhausted and i'm grinding
08:17 - through and i'm getting kind of into
08:18 - this burnout state because i'm setting
08:20 - just ridiculous goals for myself that
08:23 - don't really need to be set and that
08:24 - could be a lot more manageable so often
08:26 - times i do this for a few days i have
08:28 - this all or nothing approach and then i
08:30 - need to take an entire day off i need to
08:32 - take two days off or i'm just really
08:34 - demotivated i'm exhausted i don't want
08:36 - to work as opposed to when i give myself
08:38 - a goal of okay i'm gonna code for three
08:40 - hours each day or i'm gonna finish kind
08:42 - of a smaller feature each day and then
08:44 - i'm gonna build upon these goals as i go
08:46 - through usually by setting these smaller
08:48 - more manageable goals i'm able to work
08:50 - for a longer period of time in terms of
08:52 - multiple days in a row i'm actually able
08:54 - to get more done and the quality of my
08:57 - work is usually better than when i tell
08:59 - myself i need to finish the entire thing
09:01 - tonight really if i'm going to summarize
09:03 - here i think the art of goal setting is
09:05 - setting manageable goals that let you
09:07 - get some momentum let you build up and
09:09 - kind of achieve all of these things and
09:12 - then once you have that momentum once
09:14 - you're already achieving what it is that
09:16 - you want to do you can slowly move those
09:18 - goals further and further and further
09:20 - and continue to build that momentum
09:22 - until eventually you get to a point
09:23 - where you're being extremely productive
09:25 - you're getting a ton of stuff done and
09:26 - you're not suffering from you know kind
09:28 - of the symptoms of burnout so that's
09:30 - what i recommend set small goals slowly
09:33 - move them forward as you start achieving
09:35 - them and then you're gonna figure out
09:37 - really quickly kind of what the sweet
09:38 - spot is for you what you can actually
09:40 - accomplish and when you're pushing it
09:42 - too far and you need to kind of dial it
09:43 - back a bit so moving on here to tip
09:45 - number four i have to work on fun
09:48 - projects now this is something that i
09:50 - think is completely underrated i don't
09:52 - actually hear a lot of people talk about
09:53 - this or mention it online and oftentimes
09:56 - i see especially younger programmers
09:58 - maybe guys coming out of university or
10:00 - coming out of high school going into
10:01 - first or second year are just constantly
10:03 - grinding the most brutal boring and
10:05 - difficult computer science topics people
10:08 - just do you know 10 000 leak code
10:10 - questions or they're mastering data
10:12 - structures and algorithms or they're
10:13 - just going through these quite frankly
10:15 - pretty brutal topics without ever
10:18 - working on something fun without ever
10:19 - doing something that they actually enjoy
10:21 - and really by the time they get through
10:23 - all of this content and they've landed a
10:25 - job at facebook or google or whatever
10:27 - they're now burned out they're tired
10:29 - they're exhausted and they're asking
10:30 - themselves what was the point of me
10:32 - doing all of this work when i absolutely
10:34 - hate what i'm doing here and no matter
10:36 - how much money you're gonna pay me it's
10:37 - not gonna make me feel any better right
10:39 - that is a really common theme in the
10:41 - software engineering space
10:43 - now i always say this but the reason i
10:45 - got into programming the reason i think
10:47 - i'm as good as i am today is because
10:49 - when i was younger i didn't do this
10:51 - because i wanted a job i didn't write
10:53 - code because i wanted to show off to
10:54 - friends or i wanted to go work at
10:56 - facebook or google i did it because i
10:58 - genuinely loved it i enjoyed it and i
11:00 - looked forward to coming home from
11:02 - school every night to work on a side
11:04 - project that i had these projects are
11:06 - things that i've never mentioned to you
11:08 - i'm never going to put on my resume i'm
11:09 - not going to show anyone or kind of
11:11 - claim i'm being productive or efficient
11:13 - they're just things that i wanted to do
11:15 - that i liked and usually in those
11:17 - projects i ended up learning a ton more
11:19 - than from other projects that i was kind
11:20 - of forced to do because i actually
11:22 - enjoyed it i liked it and i wanted to
11:24 - make it as good as it could possibly be
11:27 - so please keep this in mind it is
11:29 - totally valid and fine to work on fun
11:31 - stuff maybe this weekend you want to
11:33 - forget about the data structures and
11:34 - algorithms and go and work on some fun
11:37 - project that you're not going to put on
11:38 - your resume you're not going to show
11:40 - anybody but that you wanted to work on
11:42 - and that you found was enjoyable and fun
11:44 - because after all what is the point of
11:46 - grinding through all these topics making
11:48 - this money getting this job etc if you
11:50 - just hate what you do and you're not
11:51 - happy and looking forward to actually
11:53 - writing code and you know being
11:55 - passionate about the field that you've
11:56 - kind of chosen to go into all right so
11:58 - moving on here to tip number five i
12:00 - probably have my most actionable piece
12:02 - of advice here and this is gonna be to
12:04 - do low effort tasks when you're not
12:07 - feeling good or when you're tired or
12:08 - when you don't feel like kind of diving
12:10 - into a huge code base or something along
12:12 - those lines so for me personally i have
12:14 - a bunch of stuff on the run here i'm
12:16 - doing all kinds of different stuff and i
12:18 - always have tasks that are high effort
12:20 - and that are low effort and maybe some
12:22 - that are kind of in between right a
12:23 - lower for task for example may be
12:25 - answering emails it may be watching a
12:27 - video reviewing kind of what my editors
12:29 - have done for a video that's a pretty
12:31 - low effort task but i have a lot of kind
12:33 - of grunt work for example where it
12:35 - doesn't require a ton of thinking it may
12:37 - be time consuming but again i don't have
12:39 - to think a ton
12:40 - and i can do it kind of very casually
12:42 - right i can throw on some music while i
12:44 - do this task as opposed to the very high
12:47 - effort task which is like designing a
12:49 - system
12:50 - right or writing a complicated algorithm
12:52 - or filming a video is a pretty high
12:54 - effort task for me so what i try to do
12:56 - is when i'm feeling tired when i don't
12:58 - want to get out of bed i think of all of
13:00 - the stuff that i can do that's very easy
13:02 - that's very low effort and i try to take
13:05 - all of those off my list now this does a
13:07 - few things obviously you're getting
13:08 - these tasks done but the point of this
13:10 - is that you are feeling more productive
13:13 - right when you're able to get a few
13:14 - things done in a day you have a few
13:16 - tasks under your belt usually you feel
13:18 - better you feel more productive and that
13:20 - usually translates into the rest of your
13:22 - day and allows you to start working on
13:24 - some more complicated tasks and to
13:26 - continue to keep working for me
13:28 - personally all i really need to do to
13:30 - have a productive day is get up fairly
13:32 - early work on a few different tasks then
13:34 - by the time i've done something i'm
13:36 - feeling good about myself i'm not
13:37 - feeling depressed or motivated and i can
13:39 - kind of continue and have a good
13:40 - productive day however when i wake up at
13:43 - noon or i sleep in or i'm being lazy in
13:45 - the morning or i spend an hour playing
13:47 - video games
13:48 - that usually ruins my day and i find it
13:50 - very difficult to recover and get into
13:53 - even low effort tasks after i've done
13:55 - that so what i would say is kind of keep
13:57 - your low effort task for times when
13:59 - you're tired when you're not very
14:00 - motivated and then that allows you again
14:03 - to kind of build into those more high
14:04 - effort tasks and then of course do your
14:07 - high effort task when you're feeling
14:08 - great when you wake up you have a ton of
14:10 - motivation you're feeling good don't go
14:12 - answer emails don't go do something you
14:14 - can do at any point in time do the most
14:16 - difficult thing that you can think of do
14:17 - the most challenging tasks that you've
14:19 - been putting off and try to kind of
14:21 - structure uh your work time in those
14:24 - different modes right if i'm tired i'm
14:25 - doing low effort if i'm high energy i'm
14:28 - doing high effort obviously this isn't
14:29 - always possible but that's what i try to
14:31 - do and hopefully this tip is going to be
14:33 - helpful and something you can think
14:35 - about when you're kind of structuring
14:36 - the different tasks that you need to do
14:38 - so with that said i think i will wrap up
14:39 - the video here but i am curious what you
14:41 - guys think do you agree with these tips
14:43 - do you have other tips you want to share
14:45 - with us leave a comment down below let
14:47 - me know how you're feeling when you're
14:49 - burned out and how you kind of avoid
14:50 - that or overcome that feeling with that
14:52 - said if you guys enjoyed as always make
14:54 - sure to leave a like subscribe to the
14:55 - channel and i will see you in another
14:57 - one
