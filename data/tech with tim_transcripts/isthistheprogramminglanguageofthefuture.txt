00:00 - if you watch my videos then you know
00:01 - that I love python it's one of my
00:03 - favorite programming languages I use it
00:05 - all the time and I have literally
00:07 - hundreds of hours of content teaching it
00:09 - on this channel with that said though
00:11 - I'll be the first to admit that there's
00:13 - a lot of issues with python it's
00:15 - notoriously Slow It suffers from the
00:17 - global interpreter lock now fortunately
00:19 - for all of us python users there may be
00:21 - a solution coming very quickly called
00:23 - Mojo now Mojo is a new programming
00:26 - language designed by a company called
00:28 - modular from what it's promising on its
00:30 - website it seems like it can be a great
00:32 - solution for anyone who wants to use
00:34 - Python but get the performance of a
00:36 - language like C C plus plus or rust in
00:38 - fact Mojo even claims to be 35 000 times
00:41 - faster than Python and if that's even
00:43 - remotely true then this is going to be a
00:45 - pretty big deal
