00:00 - hey guys and welcome to part 5 of our AI
00:03 - chat bot series now this is just gonna
00:05 - be a shorter kind of bonus episode
00:07 - that's giving you guys some extra
00:09 - information about the chat bot show you
00:11 - a few examples of how to actually use it
00:13 - some of its limitations and just really
00:15 - a little bit more info for those of you
00:17 - that are interested I don't expect
00:18 - everyone to watch this video but if you
00:21 - are I expect to just kind of understand
00:23 - maybe how to use this in a more advanced
00:24 - way and a little bit more info on kind
00:27 - of how it works and some of the things I
00:28 - feel like I skipped over in the other
00:29 - videos so without further ado let's get
00:32 - started now the first thing I'm gonna
00:34 - show you is just a way that I've decided
00:35 - to use this chat bot so you guys can
00:37 - maybe get an idea of kind of the use
00:39 - that you can use it for so I have this
00:41 - disc word server I think I have like
00:43 - almost a thousand people in here or
00:44 - something now and I get asked the same
00:46 - questions all the time whether that be
00:49 - on my YouTube in the comments section
00:51 - Twitter Instagram whatever but a lot of
00:53 - people ask me these questions on discord
00:54 - so I decided to make an FAQ chat that
00:57 - implements the chat bot model that we
00:59 - just discussed
01:00 - now it's similar to the first chaplain I
01:02 - showed you guys at the beginning but
01:04 - I've added a few more responses and I'll
01:06 - just show you how it works here quickly
01:07 - so you can get idea so for example if I
01:09 - say hello and then I tag the bot we
01:13 - should get a response in a second it
01:15 - says hello if I say like what's up at
01:19 - pot it says creating the singularity
01:22 - just some funny stuff for now but then
01:24 - if I ask questions like what is your age
01:27 - and again we're treating the bot kind of
01:29 - as if it's me responding to you so we'll
01:32 - say at but you see 18 years young if I
01:36 - say like where do you go to school but
01:44 - then you see I'm you in university for
01:46 - computer science so there's just a bunch
01:47 - of different responses for simple
01:49 - questions like that and I don't know
01:50 - it's kind of cool it's fun to see people
01:52 - go on and kind of mess with the chat
01:53 - BOTS and sometimes it makes mistakes and
01:55 - it doesn't have answers for everything
01:57 - but obviously if you see questions that
01:59 - are asked a lot you can go ahead and
02:01 - just add a new intent for that retrain
02:03 - the bots and that's kind of what I've
02:04 - been doing as I go through here I'm
02:06 - trying to think of any other questions
02:08 - that I can show you guys I think some
02:09 - people ask me like when
02:11 - did you start coding I don't know if I
02:15 - program one for this let's see the app
02:17 - but and I've been coding for six years
02:19 - started when I was 12 years old so you
02:20 - guys kind of get the point on that so
02:22 - anyways that is kind of an example of
02:23 - how I decided to use the bots you guys
02:25 - can throw that on discord server
02:27 - Facebook bought whatever you want to use
02:28 - it for but now I just want to show you
02:30 - actually let me show you with this
02:32 - example to is something I've done is
02:34 - sometimes you're gonna get asked a
02:35 - question that doesn't make any sense and
02:37 - rather than just picking the closest
02:40 - answer or like whatever the bot thinks
02:42 - it is we probably want to give the user
02:44 - like ask another question or like I
02:46 - don't quite understand so for example if
02:48 - I say like I don't understand well
02:53 - that's not really a question and I
02:54 - definitely didn't program anything to
02:56 - respond to this so let's just see what
02:58 - we get so I say I don't understand it
03:00 - says I don't quite understand try again
03:01 - or ask a different question if I ask
03:03 - like do you like to use Java at BOTS
03:10 - let's see if we get that - okay so this
03:12 - one was a mistake but like if I ask
03:15 - questions that don't really make any
03:17 - sense the bot doesn't have a high degree
03:19 - of confidence in it should hopefully
03:20 - give us a response that looks like that
03:22 - and that's what I'm gonna show you guys
03:23 - how to do here quickly I want to try to
03:25 - ask another question that will prove
03:27 - this what just say do you know awesome
03:32 - tuts this is just a guy on YouTube that
03:34 - I've been talking to recently so I just
03:35 - said do that and I don't quite
03:37 - understand try again or ask a different
03:39 - questions so since it didn't have a
03:40 - response for that it hopefully picked
03:42 - this one and then said I don't try I
03:44 - don't understand rather than just giving
03:46 - us some gibberish random answer right
03:48 - okay so anyways let's show how we can do
03:50 - that so for those of you that didn't
03:52 - kind of pick up on this before what
03:54 - essentially happens with our chat bot is
03:57 - we returned a list of probabilities and
04:00 - those are the probabilities on like how
04:02 - probable it thinks for example it is the
04:05 - hello intent or the goodbye intent or
04:07 - all those different classes or labels
04:09 - are intense or whatever we call them
04:11 - right so what we can actually do is we
04:13 - can look at the specific value that was
04:16 - returned to us and determine whether or
04:18 - not that is high enough for us to deem
04:21 - an acceptable response so for example we
04:24 - might get a
04:24 - bunch of different probabilities and
04:26 - they might have like one probabilities
04:29 - like 20% ones 10 another 10 and others
04:31 - 10 and others 10 another 10 and the
04:33 - highest probability is only 20% well yes
04:36 - that is the most probable answer for a
04:38 - chatbot but does it make sense probably
04:41 - not and you can tell that because the
04:43 - bot is kind of having a hard time
04:46 - deciding between all of the different
04:47 - responses so let me print this out just
04:49 - to show you guys what I mean by this so
04:51 - if I print results here and I'm just
04:55 - gonna run the kind of console version on
04:56 - my bought which I had before which
04:58 - doesn't actually have all the same
04:59 - responses as before such as activate
05:02 - chat chat but if I spell chat bot
05:07 - correctly it's CD 2 desktop CD 2 simple
05:12 - chat bot coffee and we'll just go Python
05:15 - me and up alright um so now you should
05:19 - see in a second once this loads up and
05:21 - does it this thing and I start typing to
05:23 - it that it asked me what do you call it
05:26 - or it prints out the probabilities for
05:28 - any given response so just give me a
05:30 - second here I don't know what's
05:31 - happening here
05:32 - umm okay so this is retraining the model
05:35 - for some reason anyways we'll wait for
05:37 - that to finish ok so start talking so
05:42 - now if I say like hello you can see that
05:45 - it prints out a list of probabilities
05:47 - now see that we have a probability it's
05:49 - like 1.1 7.0 e to the negative 2 like
05:53 - all these just different numbers and
05:55 - this is the list of probabilities so
05:57 - essentially what we're gonna do is we're
05:59 - gonna look at all these numbers we're
06:00 - gonna find the greatest number and then
06:02 - that's the response that we're going to
06:04 - return and that's exactly what this line
06:06 - has done right results index equals
06:08 - numpy to art Max results we just means
06:10 - pick the index of the largest number in
06:13 - here essentially so now what we're gonna
06:15 - do is actually look at that number and
06:16 - say okay is this above a certain
06:19 - threshold is it above maybe 70% or 80%
06:22 - or whatever it is if it is then we will
06:26 - do the correct response otherwise we'll
06:28 - say you know this doesn't make any sense
06:29 - like asking only question or something
06:31 - better or I don't understand something
06:33 - so that the user feels like the bot is
06:35 - maybe a little bit smarter and it's not
06:36 - just giving us a random answer so let's
06:38 - quit
06:39 - yes if I can get out of that and now
06:42 - what I'm gonna do is actually look at
06:44 - this value and just do a little if
06:45 - statement say you know if whatever so
06:47 - let's do that
06:47 - so what I'm gonna do first actually is
06:50 - I'm gonna change this just to zero so
06:52 - I'm gonna put a zero here which just
06:53 - means like pick the first list cuz it
06:55 - gives us a list of lists for all of our
06:58 - different probabilities and then what
07:01 - I'm gonna do here is I'm going to say if
07:04 - let's say here if results and then
07:10 - results index is greater than 0.7 which
07:15 - means 70% confidence so we get at least
07:18 - 70% as that value then we'll go ahead
07:21 - and we'll print one of those random
07:23 - responses from the appropriate tag
07:25 - otherwise we'll simply print I didn't
07:32 - get that and you can put whatever you
07:34 - want here obviously didn't get that try
07:37 - again
07:38 - or something though right so now this
07:39 - way when we ask a question that the bots
07:41 - not sure of it's gonna say okay well I
07:43 - didn't really get that try again and
07:45 - then the users gonna feel like it makes
07:46 - more sense so let's run this one more
07:47 - time
07:48 - Python maned up hi this usually takes a
07:51 - second to get going here
07:52 - I don't know why it keeps retraining the
07:54 - model anyways I think I like messed up
07:56 - something in the try statement here to
07:58 - make it do that oh I did I just put Tim
07:59 - - up high so we do that every time
08:00 - anyways let's type something so if I
08:03 - type like this makes no sense I didn't
08:10 - get that try again if I go hello then
08:12 - obviously I'm gonna get the answer and
08:14 - you can see that it's kind of how that
08:15 - works so anyways this kind of been like
08:17 - a little bonus video it's not super I
08:19 - don't know crazy but for any of you that
08:21 - wanted to know how to do this to get an
08:23 - error threshold I saw some people asking
08:25 - about it there you go and you know a
08:27 - cool little example of how this FAQ bot
08:28 - works if you want to test it out
08:30 - yourself feel free to join my discord
08:32 - server just come on here go to FAQ and
08:34 - start talking with the bots and
08:36 - obviously you can talk any other
08:37 - channels and talk to me as well so if
08:38 - you guys enjoyed the video please make

08:41 - you have any ideas for other series that
