00:00 - we all know that in today's world data
00:02 - is King it's the new oil the new
00:05 - currency and companies like Google
00:06 - Facebook and Amazon have built Empires
00:09 - on it using data to drive
00:10 - recommendations advertisements and more
00:13 - but this central control of data brings
00:15 - its share of problems these centralized
00:17 - entities not only gate your access to
00:19 - data deciding who sees what and when but
00:22 - they also profit from it they monetize
00:24 - your data by targeting ads based on your
00:26 - behavior profiting from your activity
00:28 - and rarely sharing these rewards with
00:30 - you now let's consider a personal
00:31 - example as a YouTube content creator all
00:34 - the data related to your channel your
00:36 - videos your views your likes it's all
00:38 - centrally controlled by YouTube you rely
00:40 - on their platform for accurate reporting
00:42 - but even more than that you're at their
00:44 - Mercy when it comes to policy changes
00:46 - and enforcement imagine receiving a
00:48 - copyright claim on one of your videos
00:50 - even though it's entirely your original
00:51 - content now this is a real problem that
00:54 - many creators face and even I myself
00:55 - have faced in the past a mistaken
00:57 - copyright claim can lead to your video
00:59 - being taken down cutting off your
01:01 - viewership and AD revenue and even if
01:03 - it's an error the process to resolve
01:04 - this can be long and tedious during
01:06 - which your content is lost in the void
01:08 - and so is your income this level of
01:10 - control can put your livelihood at risk
01:12 - it's for reasons like these that many
01:14 - are looking to decentralize storage this
01:17 - technology seeks to put the control of
01:18 - data back into the hands of users
01:20 - democratizing the digital landscape so
01:23 - now let's imagine a world where data is
01:25 - not stored in a single location but
01:27 - spread out across numerous devices
01:28 - worldwide this is the concept behind
01:31 - decentralized storage in traditional
01:33 - storage systems data is kept in one
01:34 - place such as a server or data center
01:36 - these centralized systems are vulnerable
01:38 - to hacks censorship and failures now
01:41 - enter decentralized storage a new method
01:44 - of storing data that eliminates these
01:46 - issues instead of storing all data in
01:48 - one place it is divided encrypted and
01:51 - spread across a network of computers or
01:53 - notes each node Only Stores a tiny piece
01:56 - of the overall data making it virtually
01:58 - impossible for any single point point of
02:00 - failure or attack when you want to
02:02 - retrieve your file the network finds the
02:04 - pieces across multiple nodes decrypts
02:06 - them and reassembles them into their
02:07 - original file this process offers
02:09 - enhanced security privacy and robustness
02:12 - against data loss in a nutshell that's
02:14 - how decentralized storage works now in
02:17 - the Quest for better data Management
02:18 - Solutions like ipfs and filecoin have
02:21 - emerged pioneering the space of
02:23 - decentralized storage they've made great
02:25 - progress but we're still just scratching
02:26 - the surface of this Technology's
02:28 - potential however exciting news is on
02:30 - the horizon BNB known for their
02:33 - Solutions like binance smart chain has
02:35 - just released a new and Superior
02:36 - alternative for decentralized storage
02:38 - known as BNB Greenfield now this project
02:41 - promises to further revolutionize how we
02:43 - think about data storage offering
02:45 - robustness privacy and control like we
02:47 - haven't had before in a web 3 ecosystem
02:49 - now I'm thrilled to share that BNB has
02:52 - sponsored this video and I've teamed up
02:53 - with them to bring you a Hands-On guide
02:55 - to their new decentralized storage
02:56 - ecosystem this is a brand new platform
02:59 - but today I'm I'm going to show you how
03:00 - you can interact with it and learn more
03:02 - about it completely for free alright so
03:04 - throughout the rest of the video I'm
03:05 - going to share with you more about how
03:07 - BNB Greenfield works and I'm going to
03:09 - show you a quick demo of how you can
03:10 - test it out using their test Network
03:12 - which is out right now before I do that
03:14 - I just want to say this is a sponsored
03:15 - video so everything I say you should
03:17 - take with a grain of salt you definitely
03:19 - should be skeptical but I want to put
03:20 - your mind kind of at ease a little bit
03:22 - and just say that I get all kinds of
03:24 - offers literally hundreds of offers from
03:26 - web3 and crypto related companies and I
03:28 - turn all of them down even if they're
03:30 - offering me tens of thousands and like
03:32 - massive amounts of money to promote them
03:34 - on this channel I would never tell you
03:36 - guys to go buy any type of
03:37 - cryptocurrency investment I would never
03:39 - even promote that or talk about that on
03:41 - this channel the reason I'm actually
03:42 - allowing BNB to sponsor this video is
03:44 - because this is strictly a developer
03:46 - technology right this is for people that
03:48 - want to build web3 applications they
03:50 - want to get access to this new kind of
03:52 - use case of decentralized storage and I
03:54 - thought a lot of you would be interested
03:55 - in this especially because it's free you
03:57 - can mess around with it and I know
03:58 - myself personally being being someone
04:00 - who's more into web3 I have an entire
04:01 - blockchain course as soon as I heard of
04:03 - this I thought that this really had a
04:05 - ton of cool use cases and allowed me to
04:07 - build some more web 3 apps that before I
04:10 - didn't know how I would go about
04:11 - building that would be fully
04:13 - decentralized so let me just kind of
04:14 - walk you through how this platform works
04:16 - and really what it is and then you'll
04:18 - see some of the use cases that become
04:19 - available with this type of tool again
04:21 - this is not any type of investment thing
04:23 - I'm not telling you to go buy any BNB
04:25 - I'm showing you this strictly from a
04:27 - developer perspective because of the
04:28 - dapps that this enables you to build I
04:31 - know a lot of you will find it
04:32 - interesting alright so let me just talk
04:33 - about what BNB Greenfield is well really
04:36 - this is a decentralized storage Network
04:37 - so it's a separate chain right now it's
04:40 - a test Network and it has a cross Chain
04:42 - Bridge with the binance smart chain so
04:45 - what that means is when you want to
04:46 - start using this you can buy BNB or you
04:48 - can get on the test Network in this case
04:50 - and you can transfer that directly over
04:52 - to BNB Greenfield so the currency that's
04:54 - used here is BNB and that's what you use
04:57 - when you're going to be paying for
04:58 - storage so just like you would pay for
04:59 - for some type of Amazon storage bucket
05:01 - that's the exact same thing here in BNB
05:03 - Greenfield now the way this works is you
05:05 - have a blockchain network which is BNB
05:07 - Greenfield you then have a network of
05:09 - decentralized storage providers now
05:11 - these decentralized storage providers
05:13 - are just nodes like in any other
05:14 - blockchain so they could be provided by
05:16 - a company say like Amazon web services
05:18 - who's providing a bunch of them for the
05:20 - test Network or they could be an
05:21 - individual like me who has a big server
05:23 - in my basement these storage providers
05:25 - put up some kind of stake this stake is
05:28 - their collateral so if they behave
05:29 - maliciously or they delete your data or
05:31 - they don't process your request then
05:33 - part of that stake will get slashed so
05:35 - just like how any other blockchain
05:36 - network works that's proof of stake
05:37 - that's how BNB Greenfield works so we
05:40 - have the Greenfield Network which is
05:41 - storing The Ledger of all of the
05:43 - metadata of the storage then the storage
05:45 - providers which are connected to that
05:47 - Network and then are processing your
05:49 - different requests allowing you to
05:50 - upload and download data in a
05:52 - decentralized manner I know this can be
05:54 - a little bit confusing the architecture
05:56 - is obviously more complicated than what
05:57 - I just described but we have the
05:59 - blockchain Network itself we have the
06:01 - storage providers and then they kind of
06:03 - bridge together so if you're actually
06:04 - going to be uploading data you're
06:05 - essentially picking what storage
06:07 - provider you want to go to You're
06:08 - agreeing to all of the different fees
06:10 - and billing which cannot change right
06:12 - because we're in a decentralized network
06:14 - here and then you're paying those fees
06:16 - and being able to upload download your
06:18 - data just like you would in any type of
06:20 - centralized storage Network so with that
06:22 - said let's have a look at some of the
06:24 - use cases here of BNB Greenfield so
06:26 - storage flexibility data configuration
06:28 - we kind of understand that but native
06:30 - smart contract ecosystem so the really
06:31 - cool thing here is that unlike some
06:34 - other type of storage we have like ipfs
06:36 - filecoin whatever with uh BNB Greenfield
06:39 - you can actually control your storage
06:41 - containers and upload download or access
06:43 - data using different smart contracts
06:46 - that are ethereum compatible or that are
06:48 - running on the binance smart chain so
06:49 - that means you as a developer you can
06:51 - build a Dap connected to binance and
06:53 - then you can actually give people access
06:55 - to say a video or a text file or a PDF
06:58 - or a set of exercises data that you're
07:00 - selling from BNB Greenfield so this was
07:03 - what was really cool to me because we
07:05 - have the ability to have permissions on
07:07 - data for viewership and access so if I
07:09 - want to sell you some type of course in
07:11 - a decentralized manner what I can do is
07:13 - actually give you access to a
07:15 - decentralized video that you know exists
07:18 - and that is sitting there and that's not
07:19 - going to be removed based on the logic
07:21 - that exists inside of the smart contract
07:23 - that owns that video so you pay some fee
07:26 - you get access to the video whereas if I
07:28 - was making a course and selling it
07:29 - centralized I could sell it to you and
07:31 - the next day I could shut it down and I
07:33 - could rip all of those videos off my
07:34 - central provider or alternatively my
07:37 - central provider like Amazon Google
07:39 - whatever could just turn off my storage
07:41 - they could delete all of my videos and
07:43 - all of a sudden you my paying customers
07:44 - have nothing to access so hopefully you
07:47 - kind of get the idea here but this gives
07:49 - you the ability to control your own data
07:51 - and monetize it in whatever way you see
07:53 - fit by writing custom logic and
07:55 - controlling whatever payment method you
07:57 - want it to be so actually as I move down
07:59 - here we can talk with some of the use
08:00 - cases so number one website hosting this
08:03 - is actually pretty powerful because you
08:04 - might have seen during covid and during
08:06 - a lot of other times websites can just
08:08 - get ripped down or taken down by storage
08:10 - providers let's say I have some kind of
08:12 - controversial website or I'm talking
08:13 - about something that Amazon doesn't like
08:15 - and I use Amazon web services well they
08:17 - can just delete my account and they can
08:18 - just get rid of my website where they
08:20 - can refuse me service they're fully in
08:22 - their legal right to do that if you're
08:23 - using a decentralized network that
08:25 - doesn't happen you can't have this
08:27 - censorship that we've seen happen quite
08:29 - often right personal cloud storage let's
08:31 - say you want to back up your files you
08:32 - want to make sure they're not going to
08:33 - get lost you don't want to store them
08:34 - with one or another provider obviously
08:36 - you can do that blockchain data storage
08:38 - so as we've seen with networks like
08:39 - ethereum it can be extremely expensive
08:42 - to store data on the blockchain with
08:44 - something like Greenfield that's going
08:45 - to be a much more affordable and just
08:47 - better way to do that publishing data
08:49 - post whatever social media token curated
08:51 - Registries and personal data market now
08:54 - there's a ton of other use cases and I'm
08:55 - sure you guys can probably use your
08:56 - imagination and come up with more but
08:58 - that's kind of what this net work is
09:00 - promising all right so with all that
09:01 - said let me give you a super quick demo
09:03 - on how you can start using this if you
09:04 - want and you can literally go on the
09:05 - test net in the next like 10 minutes and
09:07 - actually upload some data and View kind
09:09 - of all the permissions and how
09:11 - everything works all right so to start
09:12 - working with this technology what you
09:14 - need to do first of all is have metamask
09:16 - set up on your computer now I've already
09:17 - got the installed I'll imagine most of
09:19 - you do as well next what you're going to
09:21 - do is go to this BNB chain list and
09:23 - you're going to add the different test
09:25 - networks that you need so you can
09:26 - actually start working with BNB
09:28 - Greenfield now this link that I have
09:30 - right here is just a quick start guide
09:31 - I'll link that in the description if you
09:33 - want to click through this but if I
09:34 - click on this link here you can see it
09:36 - says
09:37 - bnbchainless.org this shows you all of
09:40 - the different chains that are here so
09:41 - what I can do
09:42 - is I can connect my wallet okay so I'm
09:45 - connected right now and then I can
09:47 - select the different networks that I
09:49 - want so the network that I need here is
09:50 - the Greenfield Mekong test net or
09:53 - however you pronounce that so I can
09:54 - click on that and click add to metamask
09:55 - and then we'll add it here now I am
09:58 - already on that Network so it's not
09:59 - going to add it for me you can just
10:01 - automatically add that to metamask then
10:03 - you also want the BNB smart chain
10:04 - testnet the reason you need that one is
10:07 - because you need to transfer assets from
10:09 - BNB smart chain
10:11 - to the BNB Greenfield Network okay
10:14 - so add both of those to metamask once
10:16 - you have those on metamask we're going
10:17 - to go access a faucet the faucet is
10:20 - going to give us some BNB we then can
10:22 - transfer that BNB into the BNB
10:24 - Greenfield token and then we can
10:26 - actually just start working with the
10:27 - decentralized storage so to access some
10:29 - BNB we need to go to the BNB Discord so
10:31 - click this link it will give you a
10:33 - invite to the Discord the URL here is if
10:37 - I can go here BNB chain so discord.com
10:40 - invite slash BNB chain let me open this
10:43 - up here
10:44 - okay and now that you're in here what
10:46 - you need to do is kind of accept the
10:47 - rules or whatever you're going to go to
10:49 - start here I think you need to like
10:51 - click on something like I accept the
10:52 - rules go to rules click on any of the
10:55 - roles here I just selected all of them
10:57 - then you're gonna go to the testnet
10:58 - faucet now from the test net faucet
11:01 - Channel you just type slash faucet and
11:03 - then your BNB address so the way you can
11:05 - get that address if you're not familiar
11:07 - is you can go back to Chrome here you
11:09 - can go to metamask
11:11 - make sure you're on the correct Network
11:13 - so you're going to be on the BNB smart
11:14 - chain testnet just going to click this
11:16 - button right here which will copy the
11:18 - account address and then if you go back
11:19 - to Discord you can just paste that in
11:21 - and hit enter when you do that it's
11:23 - going to send you some BNB you'll see
11:25 - for me if I can get down to present that
11:27 - is going to tell me I can't make another
11:29 - request because I just did one this
11:30 - morning but that will give you 0.1 BNB
11:33 - which will be enough to kind of interact
11:35 - with the test Network you can run this
11:36 - command every 24 hours so that's how you
11:38 - access the faucet from the faucet or
11:41 - once you access the faucet you'll get
11:42 - sent that BNB and then you can interact
11:45 - with Greenfield so there's this software
11:47 - right here called the seller now D
11:49 - Cellar is a user interface it's a
11:51 - website that you can go to and it acts
11:52 - just like almost Google Drive where you
11:54 - can just upload files uh delete files
11:56 - Etc so that's what I'm going to show you
11:58 - how to use there's also a ton of
11:59 - different commands you can run here from
12:01 - the command line I won't walk you
12:03 - through that because I'm sure many of
12:04 - you will kind of mess with that on your
12:05 - own if you're interested in that okay
12:07 - so I'm going to go here to deseller now
12:09 - from deseller we need to connect our
12:11 - wallet so I'm just going to disconnect
12:12 - this so that I can kind of show you the
12:14 - process again so I'm going to click on
12:16 - connect wallet I'm going to go to
12:18 - metamask then I'm just going to choose
12:20 - the account here once this finish is
12:22 - loading all right so let's get a pop-up
12:23 - metamask it's asking me to switch
12:25 - networks to the Green Field Network so
12:27 - I'm going to go ahead and do that and
12:29 - then it's going to ask me to sign this
12:30 - now this signature here is essentially
12:32 - allowing the DAP kind of access to my
12:34 - account such that I can upload delete
12:36 - files all of that because really what
12:38 - we're using on this website right it's
12:39 - just adapt and the DAP is what's kind of
12:41 - controlling the Green Field Network so
12:42 - I'm just going to go ahead and sign this
12:44 - it asks you to sign a few things okay so
12:46 - that's fine we'll assign this sign and
12:49 - then it brings up here don't worry about
12:51 - this error everything is fine and from
12:52 - here we can create storage buckets and
12:54 - do what we need to however for some of
12:56 - you you're not going to have access to
12:58 - enough BNB tokens right like you haven't
13:00 - done the transfer yet so what you'll
13:02 - need to do is go here to where it says
13:03 - wallet
13:04 - let me make this full screen and you're
13:06 - going to transfer tokens from the BNB
13:08 - smart chain using this kind of link that
13:10 - they have this bridge to BNB Greenfield
13:13 - now you'll see that I already have
13:14 - tokens so these are the tokens I have
13:16 - available in my Green Field balance
13:18 - because I already transfer them but for
13:20 - you what you'll need to do is transfer
13:21 - in so you're going to switch networks so
13:23 - what I need to do is switch to BNB smart
13:25 - chain okay so let's go ahead and do that
13:27 - and then I have the ability to type in
13:29 - any BNB that I have so like zero points
13:32 - whatever that I want to transfer and
13:35 - then I can transfer that across to BNB
13:37 - Greenfield now I can also switch this
13:38 - around and then I can transfer from BNB
13:41 - Greenfield to binance Smart chain so you
13:43 - can see I have a few tokens so I can do
13:45 - 0.05 like that
13:47 - and I can transfer that off okay
13:50 - so let me go ahead and sign this
13:53 - and we'll do that confirmation and
13:54 - you'll see that I will now transfer out
13:56 - all right so that transfer finished I
13:58 - was just trying to show you that this
13:59 - does work now what we can do is go to
14:01 - buckets and we can create a storage
14:02 - bucket if we have enough tokens right I
14:04 - showed you already have some tokens for
14:05 - you guys you'll need to transfer to get
14:07 - them so I'm going to go to new bucket I
14:09 - can name this bucket whatever I want so
14:10 - long as it follows some of the rules so
14:12 - let's go with Tim's
14:14 - bucket like that uh only lowercase
14:17 - letters okay so Tim's buckets not
14:19 - nuggets bucket okay looks like that's
14:22 - fine uh gas fee is this okay so let's go
14:26 - ahead and create that and we can also
14:28 - choose the storage provider that we want
14:29 - to use now right now Amazon web services
14:31 - is providing some of these uh providers
14:33 - or some of these storage buckets here
14:35 - I'm just going to go ahead and use that
14:37 - one it doesn't really matter okay so I
14:39 - have to sign this transaction and pay
14:40 - that small gas fee to go ahead and
14:42 - create the bucket once the bucket is
14:44 - created I can then go ahead and upload
14:46 - files alright so Tim's bucket has been
14:48 - created if I click into here we can go
14:50 - ahead and make a file so I can upload
14:51 - something up to 256 megabytes that's
14:54 - during the test net phase eventually
14:55 - that'll be much larger so let me go pick
14:57 - a file to upload and we'll see how that
14:58 - works alright so I'm just uploading a
15:00 - file here called blockchainexpert.png
15:02 - that's the course I have for web3
15:04 - development so you can see here that we
15:05 - have this pre-lock storage fee now
15:07 - depending on the size of your file this
15:09 - will be different if it's larger it's
15:10 - going to be more but this is essentially
15:12 - to make sure that you're always going to
15:14 - be able to access this asset because
15:16 - anytime you download and upload this
15:18 - kind of costs a certain amount of money
15:20 - so what this is saying here is okay
15:21 - we're going to put this file here but
15:23 - depending on the amount of times that
15:24 - someone downloads it we're going to need
15:26 - to charge a certain amount for that so
15:28 - we're going to lock this fee just to
15:29 - ensure that we can always allow someone
15:31 - to download this file now in this case
15:33 - it's literally less than a cent you can
15:35 - see it's like a micro BNB uh anyways
15:37 - there's more information about this on
15:38 - the website but it has to do with kind
15:40 - of downloading uploading and accessing
15:42 - that file all right so I'm going to
15:44 - upload this file let's give this a
15:45 - second to complete and then let's see
15:47 - what we can do from there alright so you
15:48 - can see this file has been uploaded now
15:50 - inside of my bucket which I can view I
15:52 - can go here and I can decide to delete
15:54 - it or I can view the metadata of this
15:55 - which is stored on the blockchain so
15:57 - here you can see this is private to me
15:59 - meaning no one else can access this it's
16:00 - only my wallet that currently has
16:03 - permission now I can go and change some
16:04 - of those permissions if I want but for
16:06 - now you can see when we uploaded it the
16:08 - prime primary sorry storage provider
16:10 - address and their seal address as well
16:12 - as the object hash which you don't
16:14 - really need to know and then I can
16:15 - download this if I like
16:17 - okay now what else can we do here if I
16:19 - press on this it says there's some quota
16:21 - to download I'll go ahead and click
16:23 - confirm and you'll see that it will
16:24 - download this file for me and now I get
16:26 - the image appearing that did cost me a
16:28 - tiny tiny amount but again a fraction of
16:30 - a BNB to do that okay so let me get out
16:34 - of this now and then let's continue
16:35 - alright so I think with that said that's
16:37 - pretty much everything I wanted to cover
16:38 - I will mention that if you want to do
16:40 - the permissions or more advanced logic
16:42 - obviously you got to write that into
16:43 - adapt or you can go to the command line
16:45 - tool and you can start giving different
16:46 - addresses permissions to different files
16:48 - right now this is completely private
16:50 - again meaning only you can access and
16:52 - view this no one else on the network has
16:54 - access you'd have to give them
16:55 - permission to do that anyways I think
16:57 - this is a really cool technology
16:58 - hopefully you guys got some value from
17:00 - this video and you're going to mess
17:01 - around with BNB Greenfield it's
17:03 - completely free I'll leave all the links
17:05 - you need in the description down below
17:07 - and I'd love if you let me know what you
17:08 - think of it in the comments with that
17:10 - said I'll wrap it up I hope you enjoyed
17:11 - if you did make sure to leave a like
