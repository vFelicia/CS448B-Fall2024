00:00 - first and probably the most important
00:02 - mistake I see people making all the time
00:04 - is memorizing and not understanding now
00:07 - in programming as you'll notice as you
00:09 - get more advanced into it it really is
00:12 - so just conceptually important to
00:14 - understand exactly what you're doing and
00:16 - why it works rather than just memorizing
00:19 - Snippets of code and pasting things in
00:21 - so you need to as a beginner really be
00:24 - focusing on why something works and
00:26 - understanding every single component to
00:29 - some piece of code or to some tutorial
00:30 - or whatever it is that you're learning
00:32 - before you go ahead and use that or move
