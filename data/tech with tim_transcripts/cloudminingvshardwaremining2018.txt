00:00 - I just wanted to give a little intro to
00:01 - this video before I start I realized
00:03 - that when I make my videos I do seem to
00:05 - talk a lot so if you guys just want the
00:07 - quick and short answer I'm gonna let you
00:09 - know right now that cloud mining is a
00:12 - better option in my opinion right now
00:14 - because of the factors I'm gonna state
00:17 - later in the video if you guys are
00:18 - interested in getting a cloud mining
00:20 - contract you can use the link down below
00:22 - in the description to go to genesis
00:23 - mining and select the option that's best
00:25 - for you other than that
00:27 - stick around for the rest of the video
00:29 - if you want to hear about the different
00:30 - factors and why cloud mining is better
00:34 - than regular mining I promise you it's
00:36 - worth your time and it's gonna give you
00:37 - some insight if you're really
00:39 - considering spending a lot of money
00:41 - investing into cryptocurrencies it's
00:43 - definitely worth it to listen to the
00:44 - whole video that being said I'll let the
00:47 - video play and if you guys enjoy please
00:48 - remember to leave a like answer guys and
00:50 - welcome back to another youtube video so
00:53 - today's video i'm gonna be talking about
00:54 - the difference between cloud mining and
00:56 - regular mining so using hardware and
00:59 - your own computer hardware to mine
01:01 - different cryptocurrency this video
01:03 - we're specifically gonna be talking
01:04 - about mining aetherium and doing
01:06 - comparison on that but this is gonna
01:08 - apply to the different mining here on
01:10 - genesis mining so Bitcoin litecoin
01:12 - Manero said cash etc the reason I'm not
01:15 - doing it on those is because - you can
01:17 - see here it's all sold out like coin
01:19 - sold out Minot Manero sold out the only
01:21 - other one that's available and I was
01:22 - said cash and Bitcoin Oh
01:24 - Bitcoin sold it as well didn't even see
01:26 - that so it just makes sense for me to do
01:28 - this on aetherium as I have other videos
01:30 - on my channel about a theorem already
01:31 - and how to mine that currency so in this
01:34 - video I'm going to talk about three main
01:36 - factors that we need to consider before
01:38 - we can decide which is better and the
01:40 - first one is going to be price so that's
01:42 - how much our upfront cost is and how
01:44 - much it's gonna cost us to maintain this
01:46 - and to keep mining in the future the
01:49 - second one is gonna be profit so
01:51 - arguably the most important how much
01:53 - money are we really making on this and
01:55 - how long is going to take us to make our
01:56 - money back the third one is time now
01:59 - this isn't one that a lot of people look
02:01 - at but for me it's very important having
02:03 - experience building my own mining rig
02:05 - building your own mining rig can be
02:07 - extremely time consuming so we're gonna
02:09 - talk about some of the issues with that
02:10 - and then the fourth factor I'm going to
02:12 - talk about
02:13 - a smaller factor it's just gonna be
02:14 - maintenance so how you're fixing it
02:17 - issues you can run into and so on so
02:20 - let's get right into the video with
02:22 - number one price how much does cloud
02:26 - mining cost and how much does it cost to
02:28 - build our own mining rig so cloud mining
02:30 - is easy here you can see to mine at 40
02:32 - mega hash per second it's gonna be
02:34 - costing us about $1,500 and this is
02:36 - gonna be the one that I'm start out
02:37 - looking I start looking at here on
02:40 - Genesis mining now this is gonna vary
02:42 - depending on what website you're on the
02:44 - reason I chose Genesis mining is because
02:46 - this is the most popular mining website
02:48 - so I figured I'd do it on this all right
02:51 - so that's easy fifteen hundred dollars
02:53 - about 440 mega hashes per second Mining
02:55 - aetherium over two years now something
02:59 - to note here is that if a theorem does
03:02 - go to proof of stake then it's gonna
03:04 - just start mining a different coin you
03:06 - can see here most profitable coin with
03:08 - the hardware that you've leased so
03:10 - you're not going to be losing out if all
03:13 - of a sudden aetherium changes the way
03:15 - that it is mined or it is confirmed or
03:17 - whatever alright now for the harder part
03:20 - building your own system so I'm just on
03:22 - PC part picker here now it's hard to do
03:24 - this on this website because a lot of
03:27 - the parts and things you want to buy are
03:28 - gonna be priced differently depending on
03:29 - where you get them from and availability
03:31 - is always a huge issue especially with
03:33 - graphics cards nowadays because it's
03:35 - very difficult to get them so we can
03:38 - start here I'm just the CPU I pick to
03:41 - use just very bare-bones it's a dual
03:42 - core intel celeron 53 bucks cheapest one
03:45 - I could find
03:46 - motherboard $120 we don't need to be
03:49 - able to overclock and I'm we're using
03:51 - seventh gen Intel here for 1151 this has
03:54 - six PCI lanes so up to six GPUs in the
03:58 - system four gigabytes of RAM cheapest
04:00 - Ram I could find it's still very
04:01 - expensive compared to what it used to be
04:03 - but that's when I found SSD 70 bucks is
04:07 - reliable SSD I didn't want to go with
04:09 - anything that was like thirty bucks
04:11 - because those aren't very reliable we
04:12 - don't want to use those and all this is
04:13 - gonna do is store our operating system
04:15 - and mining software
04:16 - all right GPU now this is gonna be just
04:19 - gonna vary depending on what GPU you
04:21 - pick the one that I picked you is just a
04:23 - 1066 gigabyte
04:25 - because I know this card gets about 18
04:27 - to 19 mega hashes per second so two of
04:29 - these is gonna compare to our 40 mega
04:32 - hash for a second that we have on the
04:33 - mining which is what I'm trying to do um
04:35 - so it won't actually allow me to add a
04:38 - second one for some reason so we're
04:40 - gonna have to factor that into the price
04:41 - and then I went for a 1200 watt power
04:44 - supply I know this is very overkill but
04:47 - this is just for expansion and the
04:49 - Platinum is very important so that we're
04:50 - gonna be saving money on electricity all
04:53 - right so now we have nine hundred
04:55 - seventy six dollars this is before we
04:57 - add in the price of a second graphics
04:58 - card so now we're looking at about
05:00 - fourteen hundred dollars plus tax plus
05:02 - shipping etc so with all that we're
05:07 - probably looking at about fifteen
05:09 - hundred dollars to build our mining rig
05:11 - and that's also we need a PCI riser so
05:13 - $1500 is a very reasonable price you can
05:16 - see we're looking at almost the exact
05:18 - same price as our cloud binding over
05:21 - here which is I don't know good start
05:23 - now for the second factor profit now
05:27 - this again is arguably the most
05:28 - important factor as this is how much
05:30 - money we are gonna be making now as both
05:33 - of our rigs are mining at 40 mega hash
05:35 - per second you would think that means we
05:37 - are making the same amount of profit but
05:40 - that is incorrect that means we're gonna
05:41 - make the same amount of revenue with
05:43 - before fracturing our in our costs now
05:46 - with Genesis mining we have zero costs
05:49 - because we don't have to pay to maintain
05:51 - anything we don't pay for power we don't
05:53 - have to pay for any software or anything
05:56 - whereas with our own rig we are paying
05:59 - for power which is the main cost so
06:02 - mining at 40 mega hash per second with
06:04 - zero power consumption gives us about
06:08 - nine hundred forty dollars every year so
06:11 - if we multiply that by two that means
06:13 - we're now sitting out about eighteen
06:15 - hundred and eighty dollars I believe
06:18 - over the two years so that means we've
06:21 - made about three hundred dollars profit
06:22 - three hundred and what $60 profit which
06:26 - is not bad at all for an initial
06:28 - investment of fifteen hundred dollars
06:29 - especially with very low risk which I'm
06:32 - going to talk about in one of the next
06:33 - factors there so now we need to factor
06:37 - in power consumption now this is going
06:38 - depend on how much power your rig is
06:41 - consuming obviously but the rig over
06:43 - here that we have with two GPUs each GPU
06:47 - runs it up at hundred watts overclocked
06:50 - maybe 110 watts maybe 120 watts so we're
06:53 - gonna be hmm I don't know let's say it
06:56 - run said about 450 watts all right
07:00 - 450 watts for our system this might be
07:02 - low this might be high I don't really
07:04 - know what to tell you but depending on
07:07 - how many GPUs you have and how efficient
07:09 - your a system is then just put anywhere
07:11 - between like 400 and 600 watts it's not
07:13 - gonna make a huge difference that means
07:15 - we're gonna be making about six hundred
07:17 - and twenty-five dollars a year and
07:19 - that's if we're paying about eight cents
07:22 - per kilowatt-hour which is extremely low
07:24 - so that means if you live somewhere in
07:27 - the states probably where you're paying
07:28 - about eight cents per kilowatt-hour
07:30 - you're making six hundred twenty-five
07:32 - dollars off your initial investment of
07:34 - about fifteen hundred dollars so you can
07:37 - see that it is a you're not making your
07:39 - money back within two years it's gonna
07:40 - take longer than two years until you
07:42 - make your whole profit back are your
07:44 - whole investment back now if we even
07:46 - bump this up to about 0.12 here which is
07:50 - about what I pay for power in in Canada
07:53 - then you can see our profit continues to
07:56 - go down so already we're looking at
07:58 - cloud mining as being a better
08:00 - alternative to regular mining just for
08:03 - the profit alone now this was the small
08:06 - plan too right so if we had bumped up to
08:08 - the medium plan we're gonna be making
08:10 - more profit just because when you buy in
08:13 - bulk they're giving you a better deal on
08:15 - the mega hash per second so you can see
08:16 - I'll just show you if I put in a hundred
08:18 - twenty mega hash per second now you can
08:21 - see for paying zero power we're making
08:23 - about twenty eight hundred dollars a
08:24 - year which gives us about fifty six
08:27 - hundred dollars over two years after
08:29 - paying about forty four hundred dollars
08:32 - which gives us about a twelve hundred
08:34 - dollar profit which is very good for an
08:37 - initial investment of forty four hundred
08:38 - dollars now that's profit you can see
08:41 - clearly that our cloud mining is making
08:44 - us more money than mining with a system
08:47 - that we've built and we haven't even
08:49 - brought in the third factor yet which
08:52 - time so now it's time to talk about top
08:55 - so pretty much if you're building your
08:57 - own rig that means that you're gonna
08:59 - have to do a lot of research and spend a
09:01 - lot of time figuring out what parts you
09:03 - need to buy where you're gonna get them
09:05 - from how you can get them for the
09:07 - cheapest and how long they're gonna be
09:09 - working for because if you're running a
09:11 - GPU for 24/7 every single day of the
09:14 - year then eventually it's gonna be
09:16 - degrading and it's gonna either decrease
09:18 - in performance or just die eventually
09:21 - right so there's a lot of things you
09:24 - need to do you also need to be familiar
09:25 - with computer hardware meaning you have
09:28 - to know that the the processor that you
09:32 - buy is gonna fit in the motherboard that
09:34 - you buy which seems easy but is more
09:37 - difficult than it looks you have to make
09:38 - sure that all your parts are gonna work
09:40 - together you also have to build a case
09:42 - or you can buy a case but if you're
09:44 - buying a case that's another extra cost
09:46 - personally when I had my mining rig I
09:48 - just built a wooden case cost me like 10
09:51 - bucks from the hardware store and it
09:53 - worked well for what I need it for but
09:55 - if you don't know how to do that again
09:57 - that's gonna take time and even more
09:59 - money and now you have to worry about
10:01 - issues you're gonna run into which kind
10:03 - of brings me into the fourth step as
10:04 - well these two kind of merge together
10:06 - when you're making your own mining rig
10:08 - there's a lot a ton of issues you're
10:11 - gonna run into now you you may have the
10:13 - issue where you can't even start mining
10:15 - a theory I'm alone so if you had if
10:17 - anyone had watched my video on how to
10:19 - mined etherium for beginner as you can
10:21 - see there's tons of comments of people
10:22 - saying this isn't working I'm having an
10:24 - issue with my GPU why is the fan so loud
10:26 - whatever just tons of different comments
10:28 - because people are running into issues
10:30 - and that's when they're only trying to
10:32 - mind with one GPU now imagine throwing
10:35 - in two or three GPUs and having them all
10:38 - working together using the PCI risers is
10:40 - not a not an easy task and personally
10:43 - when I build my own mining rig it took
10:45 - me about I'd say a month before I really
10:48 - had it running at full capacity now
10:51 - you're also dealing with overclocking
10:52 - you're dealing with issues with network
10:55 - maybe your Internet's cutting out
10:56 - there's lots of things you're gonna run
10:58 - into that you're not gonna run into if
11:00 - you're cloud mining so the moral of the
11:02 - story here is that cloud mining
11:05 - just a better alternative today maybe a
11:08 - few months ago it might have been
11:09 - cheaper to build your own rig and start
11:11 - mining with that but especially if
11:13 - you're a beginner and you don't know a
11:14 - lot about computer hardware it's gonna
11:16 - be a better idea to be cloud mining
11:18 - paying this money upfront you're gonna
11:20 - make a better profit and especially if
11:22 - we look at the price of aetherium here
11:23 - we're at an all-time low right now 860
11:27 - we're not gonna see the price go much
11:28 - lower than this at least I hope we don't
11:30 - see it go much lower than this so if you
11:33 - hold on to your theorem and you wait and
11:34 - you ride it back up to $1200 or whatever
11:38 - it was before about $1300 then you're
11:40 - gonna be making even more profits either
11:43 - way that you're mining so I hope you
11:45 - guys enjoyed this video and you learned
11:47 - a little bit about cloud mining and
11:49 - actual mining I know everything that I
11:51 - did here is not perfect and that a lot
11:53 - of you are probably gonna say well oh
11:55 - there's other factors to look into but
11:56 - this is just trying to give people an
11:57 - idea if cloud mining is worth it because
12:00 - personally when I first started looking
12:01 - at cloud mining I was like well this is
12:03 - absolutely ridiculous but really it's
12:05 - almost a better deal or is a better deal
12:07 - in my opinion than building your own
12:09 - mining so if you guys like the video
12:11 - please leave a like and subscribe and I
12:13 - will see you again in the next one
