00:00 - hey guys and welcome to the fourth video
00:02 - in my Python turtle graphics series I
00:06 - guess if you want to call it that and in
00:08 - today's video I'm going to be showing
00:09 - you some cool things that we can do with
00:11 - the mouse and how we can draw shapes
00:13 - kind of using the mouse and using like
00:15 - user input and it's actually pretty cool
00:17 - so I'll just show you actually what it
00:19 - looks like first of all because I
00:21 - already have it coated and I'll just
00:22 - gonna walk you through how we can create
00:24 - this pretty much you can kind of just
00:25 - draw whatever you want to draw and then
00:27 - if you want to erase at all you can
00:28 - right click and it will remove it now
00:30 - this combined with some of the stuff
00:32 - I've shown you in previous videos is
00:33 - pretty cool and you guys can kind of
00:36 - play around at that but anyways what
00:38 - we're gonna be doing for this is I'm
00:39 - gonna be introducing you to another part
00:41 - of the turtle what module which is the
00:44 - screen now I don't think I talked about
00:45 - this in previous videos but what we're
00:47 - gonna have to start off by doing is
00:48 - importing turtle and we're gonna say
00:50 - from turtle you're going to import
00:53 - turtle and we're going to import screen
00:56 - like this okay now we're simply just
00:59 - going to create a new screen object to
01:01 - make this equal to screen and then we're
01:03 - gonna create a new turtle object and in
01:05 - this case I'm just gonna say T is equal
01:06 - to + turtle and in this case I can just
01:10 - put turtle like this now this is a
01:12 - different way to create a turtle object
01:13 - it's just because we've imported it this
01:16 - way rather than just importing it like
01:18 - this okay so now I'm just gonna set the
01:21 - speed of our turtle to negative 1 now
01:24 - what this does is just gonna give us the
01:26 - maximum speed for our turtle okay so I'm
01:29 - gonna have to create two functions here
01:31 - so one of these functions is gonna be
01:32 - for when we click the right mouse button
01:34 - and the other function is going to be
01:36 - for dragging our turtle around the
01:37 - screen so the first one I'm going to do
01:39 - is called dragging okay it's gonna take
01:41 - two parameters in X&Y
01:43 - alright and then we're just gonna say T
01:45 - which their trail object dot on drag
01:47 - okay and you can just put none in here
01:50 - and you don't need anything and then
01:52 - what we're going to be doing to actually
01:54 - change direction of our turtle is we're
01:57 - going to set the heading of our turtle
01:59 - to be towards towards the X&Y and what
02:05 - this X&Y is gonna be is it's actually
02:08 - going to be the what do you call it like
02:10 - the mouse object right so
02:13 - what this sorry I just butchered that
02:15 - explanation but it's gonna be where your
02:16 - mouse is so whenever we have the turtle
02:18 - we start dragging it we want it to be
02:20 - pointing towards our mouse and that's
02:22 - what this does is it changes the heading
02:24 - to point towards our mouse and then we
02:26 - need to actually move the turtle object
02:27 - so we're changing the heading but now we
02:29 - have to move it to wherever our mouse
02:30 - position is so we can say t go to and
02:32 - then X comma Y okay and then what we're
02:36 - gonna do is we're gonna say T dot on
02:38 - drag and they were say dragging okay so
02:42 - what this means now is if you continue
02:44 - to drag the turtle object it's gonna
02:46 - continue to call this dragging function
02:47 - and set the heading and keep moving the
02:51 - object okay so the next function we need
02:53 - is called click right alright and this
02:57 - is pretty self-explanatory when you
02:58 - click the right mouse button this is
03:00 - what is gonna happen so in this case we
03:02 - are just gonna simply clear the screen
03:04 - and it's really easy to do that all you
03:05 - do is just T dot clear okay so now we
03:08 - actually need one more function but it's
03:09 - not really think of it is a function but
03:11 - it's just gonna run our main loop so I'm
03:13 - just gonna call this main okay and what
03:17 - I'm gonna do in here and say turtle dot
03:18 - listen just as I did in the last video
03:20 - and what this is gonna do is it's gonna
03:22 - listen for any like Mouse events and key
03:25 - events so that we can kind of see what
03:26 - to do when that happens so first of all
03:28 - we're gonna say T dot on drag okay so
03:31 - when we are dragging the turtle object
03:33 - that's what this method does then let us
03:36 - simply call dragging okay
03:38 - and that's gonna pass us in an x and y
03:40 - value and we'll be able to then do
03:43 - everything that I've talked about in
03:44 - dragging once that happens okay the next
03:46 - thing we do is rinse a turtle dot on
03:49 - screen click I believe the best yes on
03:54 - screen click and then in here we go to
03:57 - do click write and three so just so that
03:59 - talked to in the previous video this
04:01 - means our right mouse button if you
04:02 - wanted to be the leftmost button you put
04:03 - one middle mouse button would be to but
04:05 - in this case we need three and on screen
04:07 - click just means we click anywhere on
04:09 - the screen not just on the turtle object
04:11 - and then then we're simply gonna do
04:12 - screen dot main look like this and what
04:16 - this is gonna do is to continue looping
04:17 - through this main function until we
04:19 - click the X button on our turtle screen
04:21 - or until like we exit out so now when
04:23 - you just need to call the main function
04:25 - and this is actually it this
04:27 - our entire script so let's see how it
04:29 - works okay so here we go you can see if
04:33 - I grab this I can move it around the
04:34 - screen and if I right click ah or right
04:38 - clicking is not working right now that
04:40 - is strange I gotta make sure gotta see
04:42 - what is happening there click right I
04:44 - don't think I need the brackets for that
04:45 - let's see if that changes anything Oh No
04:49 - now we're getting an issue hmm
04:51 - interesting ok let's see what the issue
04:54 - is ah click rates I need to put X&Y
04:57 - in click right here so just make sure
04:59 - you add these two parameters and let's
05:02 - try this again there we go so now it's
05:06 - clear ok awesome so now that you guys
05:09 - know how to do this you can combine this
05:12 - with maybe changing like the thickness
05:14 - of the pen or the speed of the turtle or
05:16 - you can make it so if you right click or
05:18 - middle click then you draw a shape or
05:20 - you do whatever stuff you want to do
05:21 - like that ok so I just wanted to show
05:23 - you this I know it hasn't been like a
05:25 - very long video and I didn't do very
05:26 - much but I just want to show you this so
05:28 - you can kind of combine it with other
05:29 - stuff and you understand how to get the
05:31 - turtle object to follow along with the
05:33 - mouse object because that's typically
05:34 - something you will want to do so anyways
05:37 - that has pretty much been it for my
05:40 - turtle series and this tutorial now if
05:42 - you guys are a little bit disappointed
05:43 - that this is all I'm showing in the
05:45 - toriel's there's not that much to do in
05:46 - turtle and I would encourage you to move
05:48 - on to pygame if you're worried about
05:50 - like graphics and visuals because that's
05:52 - a much better module to be doing that
05:54 - with I have a lot of tutorial series on
05:56 - my channel where you can check out
05:57 - pygame I'll leave a link to a series in
06:00 - the description if you'd want to check
06:01 - that out and in case you want to learn
06:03 - more about turtle what you guys can
06:04 - always do is simply just go on the what
06:08 - do it go on the internet like this so
06:09 - I'll go on and just literally type
06:11 - turtle Python and read through the
06:14 - documentation yourself and it'll tell
06:16 - you all the different things you can do
06:17 - so it shows you all the different
06:19 - methods creating a circle to greet like
06:21 - all this stuff and you guys can read
06:22 - through this and kind of figure out what
06:24 - stuff you want to really do with turtle
06:26 - ok so anyways that's been it for this
06:28 - video if you guys enjoyed the series
06:29 - please make sure you leave a like and
06:31 - subscribe to the channel and I hopefully
06:32 - will see you again in another video
