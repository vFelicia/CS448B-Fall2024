00:00 - so I'm sure many of you guys are aware
00:01 - the popular internet game called agario
00:04 - which is actually what I'm playing right
00:05 - now so I thought it'd be a cool idea as
00:08 - I used to play this game a ton to try to
00:10 - duplicate it using Python sockets and
00:12 - the module PI game and allow a bunch of
00:14 - my friends and actually students to play
00:17 - against each other on a local network or
00:18 - an external server so I'm gonna show you
00:20 - guys how I created that game what it
00:22 - looks like and how you guys can mess
00:24 - rent with the project at home alright so
00:26 - this is the game running right now on my
00:28 - computer now it's difficult to show you
00:30 - this playing with a bunch of people at
00:32 - once but I will put up some footage from
00:33 - actually when I was running this in the
00:35 - classroom with a bunch of my students
00:37 - but anyways you guys can see here kind
00:39 - of how this works it's obviously not
00:40 - nearly as advanced as the last version
00:42 - of the game that I was showing you but
00:44 - this is kind of my attempt to make
00:46 - agario in Python now this is probably
00:49 - maybe like six or seven hours of work so
00:51 - nothing too crazy and I can definitely
00:52 - add a ton of stuff to it but for now I
00:54 - decided to keep it simple and just get a
00:56 - working kind of prototype anyway a
00:58 - prototype going here so you can see that
01:00 - I have two clients on my computer and
01:02 - one of them is test player the other one
01:04 - is Tim and obviously if test player goes
01:06 - inside of Tim Tim will gain all of his
01:08 - mass and then he will respawn and that's
01:11 - kind of the gist of the game what you're
01:13 - trying to do is get as large as possible
01:14 - and you can do that obviously by eating
01:16 - other players or by collecting all of
01:18 - these dots now the way that I kind of
01:21 - made this game balanced is that the
01:22 - bigger you get the slower you are so
01:24 - it's much more difficult to move around
01:26 - I also made it so that the bigger you
01:28 - are the faster you lose mass so you'll
01:30 - notice in the server code here that we
01:32 - have all of these different kind of log
01:34 - messages coming in so the server is
01:36 - starting connection happened another
01:38 - connection happened tim's mass is
01:40 - depleting test players mass is depleting
01:42 - but the speed at which your mass
01:44 - depletes depends on your size so if you
01:47 - are you know much bigger you're gonna
01:50 - lose mass much faster and that's kind of
01:52 - the way that I tried to balance this now
01:54 - obviously this window is not massive
01:56 - which means that when you have a ton of
01:57 - people playing at once well if you can
02:00 - get someone that gets very large entraps
02:02 - people essentially through different
02:04 - halves of the game so there's a lot of
02:05 - work to do but I think this is kind of
02:07 - cool and I'm gonna show you guys some
02:08 - footage of well my students playing this
02:10 - while I kind of explain why I
02:12 - wanted to make this in the first place
02:13 - so for those of you that don't know I
02:16 - actually teach coding in a classroom in
02:18 - the summer and that's what all this
02:20 - footage is from here and I apologize for
02:21 - the poor quality but it's just filmed on
02:23 - my iPhone is that's all I could really
02:24 - do while I was there but anyways what I
02:27 - do is I teach kids coding and when we
02:29 - have breaks I like to show them some of
02:31 - the stuff that I made and kind of
02:32 - inspire them and give them some ideas on
02:34 - stuff that they can do so I thought it'd
02:36 - be a really cool idea to get them all to
02:38 - connect and play this game against each
02:40 - other and that's exactly what we're
02:42 - doing here you can see that some of them
02:44 - were having a lot of fun and they were
02:45 - connecting and feeding each other and
02:47 - teaming up and they really enjoyed the
02:49 - game and it was kind of almost bad that
02:50 - I showed them because they were just
02:51 - begging to play it the entire week so
02:53 - the way that I made this game as well a
02:55 - little bit different from the real
02:57 - agario is rounds last five minutes so as
02:59 - soon as you hit five minutes the game
03:01 - freezes you can no longer eat people you
03:04 - can no longer collect dots all you can
03:06 - do is move around and then you can have
03:07 - a look at the scoreboard and see who was
03:09 - in first so now that we kind of
03:11 - understand how the game works and what
03:13 - it is I actually created let me walk you
03:15 - guys through kind of the backend of this
03:16 - and how I actually did it in case any of
03:18 - you are interested and I'll also show
03:20 - you how you can run it in kind of some
03:22 - of the limitations and problems that I'm
03:23 - running into and you know it feel free
03:25 - to help me out with this and contribute
03:27 - to the github repo that is in the
03:29 - description down below if you have any
03:30 - fixes or things you want to add to the
03:32 - game and that could be a cool kind of
03:33 - community thing we can do with this all
03:35 - right so now time to talk about how this
03:38 - actually works so this right here is the
03:40 - github repo for the project and if
03:42 - you're interested in looking at it
03:44 - downloading it or even playing the
03:45 - project yourself what you can do is
03:47 - simply click the link in the description
03:49 - for my github find this repository and
03:52 - play with the code so anyways I'm gonna
03:54 - kind of walk you through how this works
03:55 - so that you guys know how to modify it
03:57 - so you can actually use it at home so
03:59 - this works on a client-server system
04:02 - using something called socket so I'm
04:03 - gonna walk you through this which is a
04:05 - brief little drawing here so I'm gonna
04:07 - represent the server within blue here
04:10 - with an S now the server you can kind of
04:12 - think of as like the heart of the game
04:15 - and this is what's handling kind of all
04:17 - of the information that's handling all
04:19 - the connections and its handling sending
04:21 - information to and from the client so
04:23 - receiving information from the client
04:25 - sending it back to the other clients now
04:27 - what is a client
04:28 - well a client is just kind of like the
04:31 - game running so when you saw that PI
04:33 - game window there that was the client so
04:35 - I'm just gonna draw three clients here
04:37 - to kind of get you guys an idea of how
04:39 - this really works so the clients have a
04:42 - series of commands that they can send to
04:44 - the server and based on what they send
04:46 - they're gonna receive back information
04:48 - now that information might be something
04:50 - like the clients score it might be
04:52 - something like other players positions
04:54 - right that's the kind of information you
04:56 - might be getting now in this case the
04:58 - type of information I'm sending is
05:00 - commands and what these commands are are
05:02 - just strings that say certain things so
05:05 - the first one is called get okay and get
05:09 - simply means excuse my handwriting here
05:11 - I have to plug in this cord because it's
05:12 - gonna die um get just means give me all
05:15 - the information for the game and the
05:17 - information for the game is like where
05:19 - are all those little bubbles where is
05:21 - other player's position where is how big
05:24 - is everybody how fast is everybody like
05:26 - all of that is the information that we
05:28 - need and that's gonna be sent back to us
05:30 - in a dictionary so say like this is the
05:32 - command and this is what we get back so
05:34 - what we get back is a list of all of the
05:36 - players so we have like inside of this
05:39 - dictionary we have a list we have one
05:40 - for players we have one for all those
05:42 - little orbs and balls and then we have
05:44 - another one I believe for the time
05:48 - that's what it is so how much time is
05:50 - left in the game because I don't know if
05:51 - I explain this but essentially the game
05:53 - lasts for five minutes and after at the
05:55 - end of five minutes um you can't eat
05:57 - people you can't get any larger you
05:59 - can't get any smaller and what happens
06:01 - is you can just have a look at the
06:02 - scoreboard and see kind of who won that
06:03 - round so anyways this is kind of the
06:05 - information we get back when we say get
06:07 - the other command that we have is move
06:09 - now what move does is it actually will
06:13 - send the position that each client moved
06:15 - to so typically the command that we're
06:17 - gonna be using a lot is called move now
06:20 - what move is again we're just sending
06:22 - where we move so maybe we move to
06:24 - position 50/50 on the screen we're gonna
06:25 - send that to the server and we're gonna
06:28 - get back this same list so right here
06:30 - we're gonna get back the same thing as
06:32 - up here when we send move so you can
06:34 - kind of get the point here what's
06:35 - happening is each client is going to be
06:37 - sending information to the server and
06:39 - pending on what kind of information it
06:40 - sends it's gonna get some information
06:42 - back now what its gonna do once against
06:45 - that information is kind of break it up
06:46 - look at it and then display that
06:49 - information onto the screen so that we
06:50 - can see it and that's happening between
06:52 - all of the clients and all of the yeah
06:55 - between all the clients to the server
06:57 - multiple times per second right so that
06:59 - means our server has to be as fast as
07:01 - possible to be able to handle all of
07:03 - this going on at once
07:04 - now the last command that we can send is
07:07 - known as ID and this simply returns to
07:09 - us what player ID we are now the ID is
07:12 - just a number that represents which
07:14 - player because what sometimes will
07:17 - happen is if you have players with the
07:18 - same name you can't just use that as the
07:19 - ID so I've just created a very arbitrary
07:21 - number system so that each player has an
07:24 - ID and the reason you need that is
07:26 - because when you join the server the
07:27 - server is gonna send back to you this
07:29 - player list that's gonna have like 0 1 2
07:32 - 3 4 all the player IDs so you have to
07:34 - know which one you are so you know who
07:35 - you know which one you're gonna be
07:36 - moving where you're gonna put the name
07:39 - like just all that kind of stuff so
07:40 - that's kind of the gist of how this
07:42 - works so anyways let me close this now
07:45 - and let's actually go and dig into the
07:47 - code just a little bit I'm gonna show
07:49 - you what you need to modify to make this
07:51 - work so first thing we're gonna do if we
07:53 - want to actually run this just go to CMD
07:55 - and type IP config now here you're gonna
07:59 - be looking for your ipv4 address this is
08:02 - if you're gonna be running on a local
08:04 - network so mine is 192.168.1.1 62 now
08:09 - I've actually made this easier for you
08:11 - but what you usually have to do is find
08:13 - this on the server machine so whatever
08:15 - machine you can be running the server on
08:16 - you're gonna want to know this number
08:18 - now fortunately for you guys what I've
08:21 - actually done is I've coded it such that
08:23 - when you run the server it automatically
08:25 - figures out what IP your dress you're on
08:27 - and it just runs the server on that IP
08:29 - so I'll show you here if I can find
08:32 - where this code is so agario I go to CMD
08:36 - Python server dot hi you can see it says
08:40 - server started with local IP 192.168.1.1
08:52 - sorry our client code and we're gonna
08:54 - click Edit what we're gonna do is we're
08:56 - going to look for a field inside of this
08:58 - in it here that says host now host is
09:01 - going to be what we're connecting to so
09:04 - all we have to do is change this number
09:05 - to be the same as our server and once
09:07 - we've done that we're actually set and
09:09 - we're good to go and that's all we need
09:11 - to do to make this game work on any
09:13 - machine so what you're gonna do then is
09:15 - run the server code on the fastest
09:17 - machine that you have ideally make sure
09:19 - it's on the same network as all your
09:20 - other machines and on all your other
09:22 - machines you're just gonna run game make
09:24 - sure that client has that same IP
09:26 - address inside of you know that little
09:28 - field that I just showed you and that
09:30 - it'll be able to connect and and play
09:31 - and do all of that fun stuff now if
09:34 - you're looking to use this over a public
09:35 - network or you want like other people to
09:37 - be able to connect from different
09:39 - computers around the world on different
09:41 - networks what you're gonna do is just go
09:43 - on Google and just search up my IP
09:44 - address now that's gonna give you your
09:46 - public IP address and you're gonna run
09:48 - the code now from a public IP address
09:51 - now I don't recommend this because
09:53 - that's gonna mean that other people are
09:54 - gonna have your public IP address but if
09:57 - you want to do that you're welcome to so
09:58 - run it using your public IP address that
10:00 - means you're just gonna change the
10:01 - server to run on the public IP and
10:04 - you're gonna change the client to run on
10:05 - the public IP as well so with that being
10:07 - said that is kind of how this game works
10:10 - and operates I thought it was something
10:12 - that was really interesting and I had a
10:13 - lot of fun making this if you want to
10:15 - look into the code and kind of see why
10:17 - this works I've commented it quite a bit
10:19 - so you should be able to understand what
10:21 - most of this is doing and you know see
10:24 - if you can create something similar to
10:25 - it as well so with that being said I
10:27 - hope you guys enjoyed the video if you
10:28 - did make sure you leave a like and
10:30 - subscribe to the channel for more and
10:32 - I'd love to hear if any of you guys are
10:33 - actually going to be using this project
10:35 - and what you thought of it in the
10:36 - comments down below
