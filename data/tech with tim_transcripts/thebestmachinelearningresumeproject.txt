00:00 - now the first kind of category of
00:02 - projects I have here is artificial
00:04 - intelligence now in my opinion these are
00:06 - the most fun to work on and they also
00:08 - stand out a lot on a resume because even
00:10 - though they might not take a ton of time
00:12 - they're just really cool they sound
00:13 - impressive and that's kind of what
00:14 - you're going for with these type of
00:16 - projects so the first idea I have here
00:18 - is to make an artificial intelligence
00:20 - that can play a game so you can start
00:22 - with something really simple like pop
00:24 - make a neural network that can play the
00:26 - game of Pop now of course there's a ton
00:28 - of other stuff that you can do with AI
00:29 - you can make an AI chatbot you can make
00:32 - an AI that trades stocks for you you can
00:34 - do all kinds of stuff but I really like
00:36 - the game idea because you can actually
00:37 - build the game yourself in something
00:39 - like pie game and then design an AI in
00:42 - whatever way you like to actually play
00:43 - the game for you
