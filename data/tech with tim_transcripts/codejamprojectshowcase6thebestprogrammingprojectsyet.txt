00:00 - hello everybody and welcome to the sixth
00:02 - twt code jam project showcase in this
00:06 - video i'm going to show you some very
00:08 - impressive programming projects many of
00:10 - which are made by students people in
00:12 - high school people that are 13 14 years
00:14 - old it is super impressive to see what
00:16 - everyone was able to create and i'm
00:18 - going to be announcing the winners of
00:20 - this sixth code gym now if you are not
00:22 - familiar with the code jam this is
00:24 - something that runs exclusively in my
00:26 - discord server just like a bunch of
00:27 - other activities that we do make sure
00:29 - you join the discord server you'll be
00:31 - joining about 31 000 other people so
00:33 - thank you to everyone who's already in
00:35 - there and you can see how to sign up for
00:37 - the code gym now all of the information
00:39 - related to the code jam is available on
00:41 - this website right here twt codejam.net
00:44 - you do need to be a part of the discord
00:46 - server to be able to sign in you can
00:48 - view the submissions view the projects
00:49 - and all of that
00:51 - anyways this code jam the theme was
00:54 - health now we had a bunch of submissions
00:56 - i think we had over 50 submissions and
00:57 - almost over 200 teams that signed up and
01:00 - in this video i'll be announcing the top
01:02 - three winning teams as well as the top
01:05 - two projects that were hosted on replit
01:07 - now replit is the sponsor of this video
01:09 - more from them in one second
01:14 - [Music]
01:20 - alright so we will get into the projects
01:22 - in one second but i do need to thank
01:23 - replit for sponsoring this video and
01:26 - this code gym now replit is what makes
01:28 - this code jam possible they're providing
01:30 - all of the cash prizes for the winning
01:32 - teams they're also going to be giving a
01:33 - free one month hacker plan to every
01:36 - single team so all of the participants
01:38 - that i show in this video now replied
01:41 - provides an online ide that you can use
01:44 - to write code from any device so from
01:46 - your phone from your tablet from your
01:47 - computer whatever if you have access to
01:50 - the internet you can use replit to write
01:52 - code in supports over 50 different
01:54 - languages and requires no time
01:56 - whatsoever to set up you just load up a
01:58 - replica pick your language and you are
02:00 - ready to go now one of the best things
02:02 - about replied is obviously that it's
02:04 - free but you also can collaborate with
02:06 - people in real time so if you have
02:08 - someone else that wants to work on the
02:09 - same code as you you can literally edit
02:11 - the exact same file at the same time i
02:14 - do this quite a bit when i'm trying to
02:15 - help people or tutor people i'll just
02:17 - you know throw a replit open and then i
02:19 - can actually write code and they can
02:20 - modify it and look at it at the same
02:22 - time in the same file replica also
02:24 - integrates with github you can host
02:26 - stuff on wraplets like a website a
02:28 - discord bot all kinds of amazing things
02:30 - and well they're just a great company
02:32 - i've known them for a long time and i'm
02:33 - super happy that they are able to
02:35 - support this code gym so with that said
02:37 - make sure you guys check out replit from
02:39 - the link in the description and you host
02:41 - your project on replit for the next code
02:43 - gem because if you do that you have a
02:45 - chance to win an additional prize
02:47 - anyways now that we have gone through
02:49 - all of that let's actually get in to the
02:52 - different projects that we have all
02:53 - right so now that we've gone through
02:55 - that i just want to remind you here that
02:56 - the theme is health so all of the
02:58 - projects you're going to see are related
02:59 - to health in some way or another and you
03:02 - can read through all of this if you want
03:04 - but i just want to draw your attention
03:05 - to this right here which is kind of the
03:07 - judging criteria so when the judges went
03:09 - through this the way that they graded
03:11 - each project was on the theme so how
03:13 - well does it fit the theme the
03:14 - functionality the code and then the
03:16 - intuitiveness of the application now i'm
03:19 - going to be using that same criteria as
03:21 - i pick the winning teams and with that
03:23 - said let's look at project number one
03:25 - alright so i have project one open in
03:27 - front of me this project is called
03:29 - revive as you can see right here and it
03:32 - is by uh
03:35 - nissarg007 uh i'm probably messing up
03:37 - that name but this is the creator this
03:40 - actually the project that had the
03:41 - highest number of points from the
03:43 - judging round so congratulations to you
03:46 - let's check out what it is that you've
03:48 - created okay so you have made a website
03:50 - called revive health is wealth very nice
03:52 - i like the background already and kind
03:54 - of the style of the website and i can
03:56 - see that we have some services so we
03:59 - have a game that's kind of cut off
04:01 - that's fine
04:02 - another quiz thing a bmi calculator and
04:05 - something to make me laugh so let's
04:06 - check out a few of these let's go to the
04:08 - quiz okay let's start the quiz
04:11 - you have 15 seconds only select one
04:13 - answer okay straightforward different
04:15 - types of vitamins are
04:18 - both a and b okay fat soluble vitamins
04:21 - are
04:22 - i'm going to go all of the above okay
04:24 - good guess
04:25 - can coding cause a disease
04:27 - interesting i'm going to go depends on
04:29 - usage okay vitamin c deficiency causes
04:32 - scurvy
04:33 - and what does health stand for
04:35 - does health stand for something this
04:37 - acronym
04:38 - i'm not sure i'm going to go with none
04:40 - okay healthy eating and active
04:41 - lifestyles and we completed the quiz we
04:43 - got four out of five
04:45 - nice let's go home and try the other
04:47 - things that we have here so you have a
04:49 - bmi calculator okay so i guess i just
04:52 - put my height and my weight i am 175
04:55 - centimeters and i don't know exactly
04:58 - what is in kilograms about 150 pounds i
05:00 - think 68 maybe 69
05:02 - is uh is that okay so apparently i'm a
05:04 - normal weight great that is good to know
05:06 - uh let's continue here
05:09 - let's go to make you laugh
05:11 - okay i'll never forget my grand
05:13 - granddad's last words to me just before
05:15 - he died are you still holding the ladder
05:17 - that's funny uh these are actually some
05:19 - good jokes let's see here java and c
05:21 - were telling jokes it was c's turned so
05:23 - he writes something on the wall points
05:25 - to him and says do you get the reference
05:26 - but java didn't like okay i don't know
05:28 - if i can go through any more of these
05:29 - but these are funny jokes very nice
05:32 - definitely uh makes me healthier i guess
05:34 - to laugh and let's do this game here oh
05:38 - tic-tac-toe okay
05:39 - select which icon you want to be let's
05:41 - be x always go in the middle uh okay
05:44 - let's go here
05:45 - and all right just gives me the connect
05:48 - three there
05:49 - perfect okay so i think is that about it
05:52 - uh if i go game yeah okay so it just
05:54 - brings me to what i was just at i mean i
05:55 - guess okay let's just replay this
05:57 - quickly

06:00 - there you go
06:01 - go home
06:02 - very nice awesome website nice work now
06:05 - we're going to move on to the next
06:07 - project all right so moving on to
06:08 - project number two now i just want to
06:10 - quickly mention that all of the projects
06:12 - i'm showing here and all of the projects
06:14 - in general were done really well i've
06:16 - been super impressed with everything
06:17 - that i've seen from you guys especially
06:19 - considering this is a relatively low-key
06:21 - kind of code jam and it's something that
06:22 - i imagine most of you are kind of doing
06:24 - in your spare time so you guys have done
06:26 - a really awesome job thank you all for
06:28 - participating and hopefully if you
06:30 - weren't in the top five you're going to
06:31 - try again for the next code gym there
06:33 - was a lot of really close projects so
06:34 - we're all kind of you know almost tied
06:36 - for like five six seven eight so i do
06:38 - apologize if you didn't make the video
06:40 - but i did look at a bunch of those
06:41 - projects and they were really well done
06:43 - anyways let's look at project number two
06:46 - so this is by coding with 3dv and dm and
06:51 - this is called wealthier okay looks like
06:53 - this is a website wealthiest your
06:55 - program to stay healthy okay let's open
06:57 - this up
06:58 - and wow okay so first impressions here
07:00 - really like the user interface of the
07:02 - website just looks really clean
07:04 - really professional let's click on
07:06 - features okay just brings me down here
07:08 - go to about okay gives me the profiles
07:10 - of the people very very nice let's go
07:12 - back to home
07:14 - and let's try one of these diet planner
07:17 - okay number of meals per day
07:19 - three four or five meals okay health
07:21 - label um
07:23 - what am i going with here let's go
07:26 - i don't even do i need any do i need to
07:28 - select anything here let's go alcohol
07:29 - free and no sugar okay and then what do
07:32 - i want i want uh let's just go with high
07:35 - protein and calories what if we want to
07:37 - go with a lot of calories let's go with
07:39 - 3000 and let's get a plan let's see what
07:42 - this gives us okay so it doesn't look
07:44 - like this one is working maybe i did
07:46 - something incorrectly here let's just
07:48 - try balanced diet let's get rid of that
07:50 - and now let's try this and okay now
07:52 - we're getting some plans so i guess what
07:53 - i selected just didn't really have any
07:55 - available plans but this is cool it's
07:57 - actually giving me recipes for the meals
07:59 - that i can eat it's giving me three
08:00 - meals if i change this to four
08:02 - let's see is it gonna give me four now
08:03 - it does give me four okay that's really
08:05 - cool and i guess all of these uh will
08:07 - abide by whatever i put down here that's
08:09 - actually really cool i'm not quite sure
08:10 - how they did this they probably had some
08:12 - api or something that they need to hit
08:14 - but regardless the way that they
08:15 - displayed this is is really cool and
08:17 - yeah that's well done okay so let's go
08:19 - back to another feature
08:21 - let's go meditation corner
08:23 - okay hover
08:24 - inhale alright
08:27 - what's next
08:28 - oh this is kind of
08:30 - wow okay this is cool so it actually
08:32 - walks you through i guess some type of
08:34 - breathing exercises i'm not really
08:35 - anyone i don't meditate so i'm not sure
08:37 - exactly how this works but
08:39 - this is cool we've got some waves in the
08:40 - background
08:42 - very nice oh can i change this oh i can
08:44 - change the background let's see
08:47 - ah okay nice let's go to mountains let's
08:50 - see what this one looks like
08:53 - looks like it takes a second to load
08:54 - here ah there we go okay
08:56 - wow this is cool i really like this
08:57 - another neat feature i'm just going to
08:59 - go through them kind of quickly because
09:00 - i can't spend too much time looking at
09:02 - all of them
09:03 - let's go what is this macro calculator
09:06 - okay age height weight uh weight
09:09 - circumference okay i don't know all of
09:11 - these so i'm not going to go through
09:12 - this um let's i'll go through some of it
09:15 - weight
09:16 - 175 waiting kilograms 68 next
09:19 - circumference i have no idea what these
09:21 - would be uh workout goal weight gain
09:24 - okay find uh please fill out this field
09:27 - i don't know what would a circumference
09:28 - be that makes sense like 50 centimeters
09:30 - or something uh waist circumference
09:33 - i have no idea what these would be let's
09:34 - just go like this let's just see if this
09:36 - works
09:37 - okay 103 grams of fat per day 232 grams
09:40 - of protein 310 grams of carb damn okay
09:43 - so it does work interesting glad we were
09:45 - able to test that out
09:47 - let's go to the next one here disease
09:49 - info
09:50 - i want to look up a disease
09:53 - let's go with coronavirus
09:55 - i mean i guess that's not really a
09:56 - disease that's a virus unable to get
09:59 - disease info
10:01 - what would a disease be
10:03 - let's go with
10:05 - malaria is this going to give me
10:07 - anything there you go okay malaria is a
10:09 - serious disease caused by a parasite you
10:11 - get it when infected with mosquito bites
10:13 - damn okay again i don't know how they're
10:14 - getting all this information and
10:15 - displaying it so well but they're doing
10:17 - a really good job okay so looks like
10:19 - that is project number two very
10:21 - impressive everything worked which is
10:23 - obviously very good to see pretty
10:24 - intuitive and easy to work with the only
10:27 - thing i wish they would change that i
10:28 - don't have to put in like the next
10:29 - circumference because i feel like a lot
10:31 - of people would not actually know what
10:32 - that is anyways with that said let's
10:34 - move on to the next project alright so
10:36 - we are on to project number three this
10:39 - is called galactic gains already liking
10:41 - the name here that is funny let's see if
10:44 - we have any contributors i just want to
10:46 - see who made this
10:48 - let's go to contributors and okay so
10:51 - just by fin413 10 000 inserts 7000
10:55 - deletes very nice let's go to your
10:57 - website and let's see my connection is
10:59 - not private uh that's fine let's
11:02 - continue
11:03 - okay galactic gains fitness that's out
11:06 - of this world i like the kind of
11:07 - cartoony ui you guys have done a really
11:09 - good job with the user interfaces on all
11:11 - of these code gems i've been super
11:12 - impressed let's start my fitness journey
11:15 - okay quick start
11:16 - name your alien i'm gonna go with tim
11:19 - really creative let's go with a nice
11:21 - pink
11:22 - submit and damn okay
11:24 - so this is a game wow okay happiness
11:27 - alien weight alien hunger workout eat
11:30 - let's take a tour welcome to the alien
11:32 - word world of galactic gains this looks
11:35 - like a very professional game so far i'm
11:37 - i'm very impressed tim is a bloody alien
11:39 - from another planet their food is scarce
11:41 - and exercise is necessary to escape
11:43 - scary predators
11:44 - now that they've come into your care
11:46 - it's your job to make sure they continue
11:47 - to exercise and stay in shape next your
11:49 - alien's weight goes up every day the
11:51 - dial in the top right indicates how much
11:53 - tim weighs okay tim also gets hungry
11:56 - every day okay
11:57 - this happened this happiness indicator
11:59 - is in the top left
12:01 - shows you how they're feeling make sure
12:03 - to keep them happy
12:04 - nice pressing the workout button will
12:06 - reduce your weight try clicking it now
12:08 - wow
12:09 - okay
12:10 - this is really cool this is a neat game
12:12 - even the way that it's transitioning
12:14 - between all of the pages uh so i'll play
12:16 - through this for a few minutes and see
12:18 - if we can get some progress but i
12:19 - imagine you can probably play this for a
12:22 - fairly
12:23 - long period of time
12:24 - uh do i need to click done or should i
12:26 - wait for the lunges to be finished
12:29 - uh okay click done pressing the e button
12:31 - will fill up your hunger bar okay eat
12:34 - this game is how your alien eats oh my
12:36 - gosh okay use wasd and the arrow keys to
12:38 - move the spaceship around
12:40 - your goal is to collect green healthy
12:41 - foods it'll appear alright at any point
12:44 - during the game you can press e to
12:45 - exercise okay in the side menu you can
12:47 - view your stats oh my gosh this has so
12:50 - much stuff in it this site was made in
12:52 - four weeks for the 2021 timothon very
12:54 - nice even puts a link here awesome okay
12:56 - let's let's play through this uh let's
12:58 - eat let's see if this works press e to
13:01 - exercise okay so i can move my spaceship
13:04 - around nice wait i lost speed oh i want
13:07 - to eat healthy that makes sense
13:10 - damn these things are moving pretty
13:12 - quickly ah come on okay i don't think i
13:14 - could reach that
13:15 - donut yeah that was i don't want that
13:17 - okay this is uh not going very well
13:20 - come on give me that
13:22 - geez it just doesn't want to give me
13:24 - anything healthy
13:26 - uh okay let's exercise let's do some
13:28 - push-ups
13:29 - okay
13:30 - oh i actually have to wait for this
13:32 - before i can click done okay eight seven
13:35 - six
13:36 - five
13:37 - four
13:38 - three
13:39 - two
13:40 - and one
13:42 - okay done
13:44 - continue
13:46 - i guess oh it's because my speed is so
13:48 - low that makes sense why i can't reach
13:49 - anything so to increase the speed i
13:51 - guess i need to work out and the speed's
13:52 - even lower now okay i'm going to stop
13:54 - playing this this is just not going well
13:56 - for us um that's fine look how much i
13:58 - weigh now okay um that's cool let's work
14:01 - out one more time and see if the weight
14:02 - goes down and then after that i think
14:04 - i'm going to be done playing this right
14:05 - now but i do imagine you could play this
14:07 - for a very long period of time uh very
14:09 - cool game though very impressed with
14:11 - everything seems like a lot of work went
14:13 - into this so let's
14:15 - finish our five squats
14:17 - and okay we've lost some weight very
14:19 - very good to see very nice settings what
14:21 - do we have here retake tutorial delete
14:23 - alien
14:24 - and let's go back home
14:26 - great there we go create and customize a
14:27 - workout companion learn easy and
14:29 - approachable exercises okay so that's
14:31 - kind of the point every time you're
14:32 - working out it's showing you an exercise
14:33 - that you could be performing very nice
14:35 - awesome work i'm super impressed by that
14:37 - this is a really cool game now we're
14:39 - gonna move on to project number four
14:41 - alright so in front of me is project
14:43 - number four this is called vera or avera
14:46 - uh yeah vera is probably correct right
14:48 - multipurpose health care tools uh has i
14:52 - like when they do all these little uh
14:54 - like information panel things i'm sure
14:55 - they're easy to add on github but makes
14:57 - it look kind of nice
14:58 - okay let's just quickly read through
15:00 - this
15:01 - where are our contributors ben robo very
15:04 - nice okay
15:05 - let's go to the website and let's check
15:08 - it out okay so this is hosted on replit
15:11 - awesome i will wait for this to load and
15:12 - then i will show you what it looks like
15:15 - sweet so it is loaded there we go
15:17 - personal fitness tools

15:27 - meditation heart rate calculator oh my
15:29 - god it's got so many things let's go

16:19 - oh he does change okay that's cool
16:21 - that's a nice feature
16:23 - all right let's go to the coronavirus
16:24 - tracker can i click into it
16:27 - ah there we go personal covert 19 chat
16:29 - bot okay chat bot it's a simple copy 19
16:32 - bot all you have to do is type a country
16:33 - name to get coded results okay let's go
16:35 - with canada
16:36 - that is where i am and there we go we
16:38 - get the cases the deaths let's go with
16:40 - usa or do i need to do america usa there
16:43 - you go
16:44 - sweet uh i'm not going to do the voice
16:46 - recognition actually let's see maybe
16:48 - this will work
16:51 - canada
16:54 - canada
16:56 - it doesn't seem like it's working or
16:58 - maybe i just okay let's try now
17:00 - canada no okay so it's not working
17:02 - that's fine let's go to muscle builder
17:04 - current weights uh can you adjust this
17:08 - uh not sure okay just shows you a bunch
17:10 - of exercises you can do
17:13 - oh let's go chest
17:16 - highlights the area that's really cool
17:18 - start workout
17:19 - specify target workout value um
17:23 - not sure
17:24 - what that means uh
17:27 - oh it's like a timer for doing something
17:30 - okay that's cool
17:31 - and then it tracks the number of
17:32 - workouts i've done
17:35 - current weight oh that's based on what i
17:37 - did previously okay that makes sense so
17:38 - it's saved from before
17:40 - and then says i did the chest muscle two
17:42 - times uh this date does not look correct
17:44 - unless that was there before
17:46 - and i guess it gives you some chest
17:48 - exercises
17:49 - cool okay let's go to food recipes
17:52 - see if this one's working
17:55 - okay there we go and bunch of recipes
17:58 - very nice let's click in one
18:00 - and damn it gives you all of the diets
18:02 - that it satisfies the ingredients
18:05 - preparation

18:08 - lot of features on here let's go health

18:43 - going to continue with that but i trust
18:44 - that works let's put my age in 21
18:48 - okay calculate target heart rate
18:50 - what should i be at
18:52 - 239 beats per minute
18:54 - i feel like that can't be correct that i
18:57 - should be targeting 239 beats per minute
18:59 - um
19:01 - maybe maybe i'm just not sure what if we
19:02 - go like 40 what would that one be
19:06 - let's see
19:08 - 223 okay maybe i'm just not aware of how
19:10 - high the heart rate's supposed to be but
19:12 - that seems high to me i don't usually
19:15 - when i'm working out i don't think i
19:16 - have 200 beats per minute as my heart
19:18 - rate um okay well with that i think
19:20 - that's pretty much it another really
19:23 - impressive website here i was a little
19:24 - bit confused on some of the tools but
19:26 - then after a second i understood them
19:28 - but yeah very nice work let's move on to
19:30 - the next project alright so moving on to
19:32 - project number five we have d-a-d-r-f
19:35 - and this is the health app so the
19:37 - contributor is d-a-d-r-f
19:40 - all right so let's just go right to the
19:41 - website and let's see what we got here
19:45 - click on this one here
19:46 - looks like it's hosted on heroku that is
19:49 - fine next time maybe you can host on
19:50 - replit and aim for the other prize
19:53 - for some reason this is taking a second
19:55 - to load here and okay there we go so we
19:58 - are in uh welcome to health or hell yeah
20:01 - health health okay i understand what
20:03 - they did there a simple tool to manage
20:05 - your well-being register or log in let's
20:07 - register uh email id okay i'm gonna fill
20:09 - this in and then i'll be right back all
20:11 - right so we have now registered we are
20:13 - in it's giving me something about coven
20:15 - 19. i guess that's like the total number
20:16 - of cases maybe um not really sure what
20:18 - that means uh my tablets blog doctor
20:22 - about facts and exercise let's go to my
20:24 - tablets uh tablet name
20:27 - let's just go with
20:29 - vitamins
20:30 - i just want to test if this is going to
20:31 - work
20:32 - regular time
20:34 - let's go 7 52 p.m why not add tablet
20:37 - okay it's going to keep track of it for
20:38 - me and then if i click at this
20:40 - i can use the dosage the cure prescribed
20:42 - by
20:43 - damn okay that's really cool
20:45 - it shows me the time to take this out
20:47 - let's go back
20:49 - let's try exercise
20:51 - okay
20:52 - some youtube channels to follow that's a
20:53 - cool idea shows you some nice workout
20:55 - channels some recipes to try out
20:57 - let's see here enter waiting kilograms
20:59 - good job i looked at what this was
21:01 - before okay male height 175
21:05 - age 21 daily activity i would say
21:07 - moderate exercise okay let's calculate
21:10 - and
21:12 - your daily calorie intake should be 2
21:14 - 600 okay that sounds about right
21:16 - let's now go to the blog
21:18 - and let's see here script alert test
21:21 - okay i guess people have just been
21:22 - adding stuff to the blog let's say
21:24 - this is a very cool app
21:28 - nice work title
21:31 - cool app and i won't add an image and
21:34 - there we go cool app by tech with tim no
21:37 - image was provided and you can see
21:38 - there's a very cool app nice work
21:40 - awesome okay sweet that is a nice blog a
21:43 - health blog i guess
21:44 - and then doctor you can invite your
21:46 - doctor let's see how this works so if i
21:47 - enter my doctor's email it would send an
21:49 - email to him or i can copy the code so
21:52 - let's copy the code here and let's just
21:55 - go in my chrome tab and see if this does
21:58 - anything medical information of tech
21:59 - with tim oh that's neat okay tells me
22:01 - the vitamins
22:02 - gives me comments or i can leave a
22:04 - comment i guess add a google map to your
22:06 - doctor's clinic name of your doctor's
22:08 - clinic name of doctor
22:10 - okay i'm not going to do that
22:12 - let's continue this though let's go to
22:14 - your doctor's room okay and it just
22:16 - brings me to the same page
22:18 - very nice that's a cool idea so you can
22:19 - share information online with your
22:21 - doctor not sure how secure this is but
22:22 - i'll ignore that for right now and
22:24 - health facts everyone has a unique smell
22:26 - except for identical twins who smell the
22:27 - same really that's cool uh health fact
22:29 - you burn more calories sleeping than you
22:31 - do watching television nice 20 of all
22:34 - airline passengers catch a cold after a
22:35 - two-hour flight
22:37 - that sounds about right i mean that
22:38 - makes sense your buddy has enough iron
22:40 - in it to make a nail three inches long
22:43 - damn that is cool fact too
22:45 - all right so with that i think i went
22:47 - through everything in this application
22:49 - so now that i've showed you the top five
22:51 - projects i'm going to announce the top
22:53 - two projects hosted on replit and then
22:55 - the three winning teams alright so i've
22:57 - just reviewed the projects for a second
22:59 - time i wanted to make sure i wasn't
23:00 - missing any features before i actually
23:02 - made a decision on the winners now i
23:04 - just want to give a huge thank you again
23:06 - to everyone who participated in this
23:08 - code gym yes the prizes are nice yes the
23:10 - hacker plans are nice but at the end of
23:12 - the day i do this just so you guys have
23:14 - an opportunity to practice your
23:15 - programming skills work in a team and
23:17 - have some fun working on a project you
23:19 - can see my cats joining me now anyways i
23:22 - want to mention again that this was
23:24 - really close a lot of these projects
23:26 - were pretty similar to each other in
23:28 - quality in the idea as well and so it
23:30 - was really hard for me to actually
23:31 - decide who the winning projects should
23:34 - be anyways i did come up with a decision
23:36 - i just wanted to tell you it was super
23:37 - close and it really could have gone
23:39 - either way so if you didn't get selected
23:40 - as a winner that doesn't mean your
23:41 - project was bad in fact all of them were
23:43 - really really good all right so let me
23:45 - start by announcing the two best
23:47 - projects that were hosted on replit and
23:49 - then i will go through and select the
23:51 - three winning teams so the first best
23:54 - project that was hosted on replit revive
23:57 - so this one right here by the team code
23:59 - decode okay my cat needs to chill there
24:02 - but let's go and remind you what revive
24:04 - looks like this is the revive website
24:07 - so again we already went through this
24:09 - but it has a few different games that
24:10 - you can play it has these jokes which i
24:12 - actually thought were quite funny i
24:14 - thought the website generally was
24:15 - polished everything was working and well
24:18 - it was the best project that was hosted
24:19 - on replied so congratulations you will
24:21 - be getting a prize all the members of
24:23 - this team and a free one month replete
24:26 - hacker plan
24:27 - awesome so now let's go back here and
24:30 - let me show you the second best project
24:32 - that was hosted on replit this is some
24:34 - suspenseful music please
24:36 - covid ml now this is a project that we
24:39 - have not seen yet so i'm actually going
24:40 - to showcase this to you but as you can
24:42 - see it's right here on wraplet and if i
24:44 - go and click on this it will go full
24:46 - screen for me
24:47 - and i can see this covid ml web
24:49 - application so it says covet ml uses a
24:51 - series of machine learning models to
24:53 - predict whether or not you have covit
24:55 - 19. i like the disclaimer here don't use
24:58 - this as a medical indicator okay so
25:00 - let's take the survey it's a bunch of
25:02 - questions i'll just go through it kind
25:03 - of quickly
25:04 - let's say yeah we have a runny nose no i
25:06 - don't have asthma do i have a headache
25:08 - uh yes let's go heartache no diabetes no
25:11 - high blood pressure sure do you feel
25:13 - fatigued sure
25:14 - this no have you traveled the bar abroad
25:17 - yes no no
25:19 - yes
25:19 - yes no or yes and you use hand sanitizer
25:23 - yes okay get results
25:25 - and zero of our models predict that you
25:27 - would test positive for covet 19.
25:29 - awesome that is very good to know
25:31 - and then we have the three models that
25:33 - it uses right here so relatively simple
25:35 - application but still useful everything
25:37 - worked it was intuitive it was easy i
25:39 - thought the user interface looked good i
25:40 - like even just you know small things
25:42 - like kind of the clipart they have here
25:43 - on the site and that first kind of
25:45 - animation like this that we saw where it
25:47 - brings up these little uh neural network
25:49 - nodes together so congratulations you
25:52 - are the second best project host on
25:53 - replit you will also be getting a prize
25:56 - and a one month free hacker plan i
25:58 - believe this is by uh absurd yeah i'm
26:01 - not gonna be able to pronounce that
26:02 - username but congratulations alright so
26:04 - now that we have looked at those it is
26:06 - time to announce the top three winning
26:09 - teams now in third place i have
26:11 - suspenseful music please
26:14 - wealthier so congratulations guys your
26:16 - project came in third place now i
26:18 - already showed this but it has a lot of
26:20 - awesome features i thought the ui was
26:22 - really well polished everything just
26:24 - worked well and at the end of the day if
26:26 - it works it's useful information it fit
26:28 - the theme and it was intuitive you guys
26:30 - did a very good job so congratulations
26:32 - you all will be getting a prize as well
26:34 - as a one month free hacker plan
26:37 - right so now we are moving on to the
26:38 - second place team and the second place
26:41 - team is suspenseful music please
26:44 - galactic games or the second place
26:46 - project sorry this was one of my
26:48 - favorite projects that i've seen in all
26:50 - of the code gems the reason being it was
26:52 - really creative and unique and i just
26:54 - like the fact that this was a game it's
26:55 - kind of gamifying health and exercise
26:57 - and you did something different from
26:59 - everyone else this was a super unique
27:00 - application and the only reason i put it
27:02 - in second instead of first was just
27:04 - because i thought there could have been
27:06 - more emphasis on the health because yeah
27:08 - we have the exercise but other than that
27:10 - it was kind of the only you know health
27:12 - thing and then maybe you have the foods
27:13 - too but regardless i thought it was
27:15 - really really good this was an awesome
27:17 - game and i'm sure many people like
27:19 - especially kids maybe would actually
27:20 - play this game this could be a
27:22 - legitimate game so really nice work
27:24 - great job the tutorial was really well
27:26 - done too the way that all of the kind of
27:27 - transitions occurred user interface was
27:29 - well polished and yeah i could go on and
27:31 - on but you did a awesome job so
27:33 - congratulations on second place now that
27:35 - leaves in first place as many of you
27:38 - would have already guessed health tools
27:41 - now this in my opinion was kind of the
27:43 - best all-around platform that we had so
27:46 - this is vera right if we go to get
27:49 - started here we had to wear the mask i
27:51 - thought that was a nice touch
27:52 - immediately to go ahead and get inside
27:54 - let's use our username of tim and then
27:57 - we had our profile that we set up right
27:59 - so we immediately put in our bmi or we
28:01 - got our height and our weight so we got
28:02 - our bmi we did the coronavirus tracker
28:05 - it had the voice recognition which i'm
28:06 - going to assume works although it wasn't
28:08 - working for me we had the chatbot which
28:09 - was cool we had the muscle builder we
28:12 - had the food recipes we had the health
28:13 - news we had the meditation we had the
28:15 - heart rate test everything's super
28:17 - related to health the platform looked
28:19 - really nice and streamlined and even
28:21 - something like the landing page if i go
28:22 - back outside of the dashboard here i
28:24 - just thought they did a nice job right
28:26 - you can see little animations it tells
28:28 - you how all of the tools work so that's
28:29 - kind of why i picked it again maybe
28:31 - that's my bias maybe you guys liked a
28:33 - different project better but in my
28:34 - opinion this was kind of the best one
28:36 - when it came to fitting the theme and
28:38 - overall having a bunch of useful
28:39 - features that all seemed to work related
28:42 - to health so congratulations of course
28:44 - you guys will be getting a prize as well
28:46 - as the one month free hacker plan so
28:48 - with that said that concludes this video
28:51 - if you stuck around until the end thank
28:52 - you very much for looking through all of
28:54 - the projects i do try to go through
28:56 - these quickly but there's so much stuff
28:57 - to show and i don't want to skip over
28:59 - important features so i do apologize if
29:01 - the video is long but that is what
29:03 - anyways make sure you guys sign up for
