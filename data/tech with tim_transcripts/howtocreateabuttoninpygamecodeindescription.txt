00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:02 - YouTube video so in today's video I'm
00:04 - just doing another tip and trick for
00:07 - pygame and in this one I'm going to be
00:08 - showing you guys how to make a
00:09 - rectangular button now this is fairly
00:13 - simple although I've made it a little
00:15 - bit more complex just so that you can do
00:16 - more with the button I'm gonna show you
00:18 - a quick example of here what my button
00:20 - looks like so I've just got a nice green
00:22 - button here it says click me and you can
00:24 - see when I hover over top of it it
00:25 - changes colors now I know you probably
00:27 - don't want your green bun to change red
00:29 - but you can change the color that it
00:30 - changes to I've just done mine red so
00:32 - it's easy to see and we have text in the
00:34 - middle of the button if you notice it's
00:36 - pretty well directly in the middle um
00:38 - maybe it could be moved down a little
00:40 - bit in the Y actually no it looks pretty
00:41 - good in terms of being pretty centered
00:43 - that's what I've tried to do there and
00:44 - if I click the button you can see behind
00:46 - me on the console it says click the
00:48 - button if I click outside of the screen
00:50 - it's not working my mouse has to be on
00:52 - the button for that to work so if you
00:54 - want to learn how to do this make sure
00:55 - you stick around for the rest of the
00:57 - video and if you're really not
00:58 - interested in how it works and you just
00:59 - want the code go ahead and go down to
01:01 - the description down below and I'll have
01:03 - the code the class for my button if you
01:06 - want to just copy and paste that into
01:07 - your own program and you're gonna have
01:09 - to figure out how to use it on your own
01:10 - though if you don't watch the rest of
01:12 - the video so let's get into the kind of
01:15 - explanation here now so pretty much it's
01:19 - really easy to do things in an object
01:21 - orientated way when you understand
01:23 - classes and you understand objects if
01:25 - you don't know what those things are and
01:26 - you want to learn I do have a Pike
01:28 - Python just regular Python series where
01:31 - I talk about how those things work and
01:33 - if you learn those it's really useful
01:35 - for you just your coding ability so I'll
01:37 - put a card fill in and talk right hand
01:39 - corner now anyways I've created a button
01:41 - a button class now it takes your
01:44 - standard parameters here when you create
01:46 - a new object it takes color X Y width
01:48 - height and then an optional parameter of
01:50 - text so that means you can have a button
01:52 - that has text on it or a button without
01:54 - text on it now here it has two main
01:57 - methods as a draw method and an is over
02:00 - method now this is over method is going
02:02 - to save you a ton of time I'll go into
02:04 - that in a second the first one we're
02:05 - going to talk about is the drama so
02:07 - pretty much this takes a parameter of
02:08 - win and then outline now what this
02:11 - outline parameter does here
02:13 - is it allows you to have an outlined
02:15 - button so I'll show you here when I draw
02:17 - if I just change to this how the outline
02:19 - will work it's easier and shown by
02:22 - demonstration so now you can see that my
02:25 - button has an outline because I've
02:27 - simply added a color for the outline
02:29 - when I'm drawing the button sorry I kind
02:32 - of skipped over a few things I'll go
02:33 - back here so pretty much when you want
02:35 - to draw the button you just call
02:36 - whatever the name of your button is in
02:38 - this case I called mine green button and
02:40 - then dot draw which I did right here you
02:43 - give it a window or a surface to draw it
02:45 - on to in this case mine is just the
02:47 - window that I created up top here and
02:48 - then if you want to you can give it a
02:51 - color for a possible outline now my
02:53 - outline is 2 pixels thick but yours
02:55 - could be for 8 you can change that if
02:58 - you'd like within the class so what
03:00 - happens here is if we have an outline
03:02 - color we're gonna draw a rectangle that
03:04 - is slightly larger than the original
03:07 - rectangle that has an outline and the
03:10 - way that we do an outline is we just
03:11 - subtract 2 from both the X and the y and
03:13 - then we add 4 to the width and the
03:15 - height so that way as we move back to if
03:17 - we only added 2 you'd only see an
03:19 - outline on the left-hand and the top and
03:21 - side so by adding 4 you see it on all
03:23 - sides and if you want this outline to be
03:25 - thicker just multiply these numbers and
03:27 - whatever you do to these numbers you got
03:28 - to do to these ones and that'll work all
03:31 - right and then we just draw a regular
03:32 - rectangle the one that we've defined up
03:34 - here so we have a color X Y width height
03:37 - and then if we have text we I just
03:39 - create text with this font here
03:41 - obviously you can change the font if you
03:42 - want you can change the size I render it
03:45 - out make it just defaulted to black but
03:48 - again you can change that color and then
03:50 - this long mess here is what centers it
03:52 - in the middle of the button I did that
03:54 - for you guys so that it's easier when
03:56 - you're using it and then this is over
03:58 - method here pretty much checks if your
04:01 - mouse is over top of the button so the
04:03 - way that you use this is it's gonna
04:05 - return a true or a false value so you
04:08 - just call green button dot is over you
04:10 - give it a coordinate so just the mouse
04:13 - position is what this one takes but you
04:14 - could just give it like an X Y and a
04:16 - tuple and that would work as well and it
04:17 - tells you if that position is over top
04:19 - of the mouse it just does that but doing
04:21 - a quick little comparison here if you
04:23 - watch my PI game programming series
04:25 - where I made a game then I do
04:26 - and their thing and that and yeah it
04:28 - just gives you either true or false so
04:30 - then that way you can tell if you click
04:32 - the button or you did not all this mess
04:35 - down here is just me implementing the
04:37 - button into a program that I made really
04:39 - simple all I do is just have a button
04:40 - that has the what you guys saw or have a
04:43 - window that has a button on it when you
04:44 - click it it says click me so I'll show
04:46 - you how I implement all these things in
04:48 - here pretty much we just do a basic game
04:52 - loop we're just redrawing the window
04:53 - every frame by using this and I create
04:57 - the button by just doing green button
04:58 - and then a new instance of the button so
05:00 - button that's what I called my class we
05:02 - give it a color X Y width height text
05:05 - down here we get the mouse position
05:08 - every time an event happens and then if
05:11 - we're clicking our mouse button so you
05:13 - can probably hear me clicking now then
05:15 - it's just gonna call this method so
05:16 - green button dot is over if we're over
05:18 - top of it it's gonna say you clicked on
05:21 - the button now this is where things are
05:22 - I wouldn't say tricky but a little bit
05:24 - different when wherever it whenever
05:26 - we're moving the mouse so we're gonna
05:28 - check to see if the mouse is over top of
05:30 - the green button this doesn't mean we've
05:32 - clicked on it it just means that we're
05:33 - hovering over top of it and then what
05:35 - we're gonna do is if we are hovering
05:36 - over top of it so if this is true then
05:40 - we are just going to change the color to
05:41 - red and if we're not hovering over top
05:45 - of it we're gonna change the color back
05:46 - to its original color of green so I hope
05:49 - this helps you out if you want to just
05:52 - take the code for you can play around
05:53 - with this class simply just I'm gonna
05:55 - put this in the description down below
05:56 - copy and paste into your program if you
05:58 - guys have any questions feel free to
06:00 - leave a comment down below I try to
06:01 - respond to all my comments and if this
06:03 - video helped you please help me out by
06:05 - leaving a like and subscribing and I'll
06:07 - see you again in another video
