00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:10 - youtube video
00:11 - so in today's video i'm going to show
00:13 - you how to print out colored text
00:15 - from python to your default console or
00:17 - command prompt depending on what
00:19 - operating system you are on
00:20 - now this method is super simple to use
00:23 - super easy to set up
00:24 - and this will work on mac windows and
00:26 - linux where all of the default
00:28 - terminals now this will likely work in
00:30 - some other terminals as well if you're
00:32 - using some special one
00:33 - but i cannot guarantee that because the
00:35 - only thing that i've tested this on
00:37 - was mac windows and linux in those
00:39 - default consoles or terminal
00:40 - environments
00:41 - so with that said let's go ahead and get
00:43 - started the first thing that we need to
00:45 - do is actually install some module
00:47 - it's called colorama now quickly before
00:49 - we do that you can see all of the
00:50 - different styles i'm going to show you
00:52 - how to create
00:52 - on the right hand side of my screen of
00:54 - course there's more that you can create
00:56 - as well but this was just to give you an
00:57 - idea
00:58 - of what this tutorial will actually do
00:59 - and kind of cover and show you what
01:01 - you'll be able to make afterwards
01:03 - anyways let's start the first thing that
01:05 - we need to do is actually install a
01:07 - python module
01:08 - again this is called colorama now to do
01:10 - this we're going to go to our command
01:12 - prompt or terminal depending on what
01:13 - operating system you're on and you're
01:14 - going to type the following line
01:16 - pip install colorama like that
01:20 - now type that line and press enter this
01:22 - should install color ammo for you
01:24 - if for some reason this doesn't work you
01:26 - can try the other following command
01:27 - which is pip 3 install colorama
01:30 - the reason you add the 3 here is because
01:32 - pip 3 references
01:33 - python 3 and on linux and mac
01:35 - specifically
01:36 - usually you have a default python 2
01:38 - installed
01:39 - and the regular pip will reference that
01:41 - so try both of these if for some reason
01:43 - neither of these commands work for you
01:45 - try the following python hyphen m pip
01:48 - install
01:49 - colorama like that same thing for this
01:52 - command if that doesn't work with the
01:53 - default python
01:54 - then try python 3. now this may work for
01:57 - you but you might find sorry the default
01:58 - python might work for you but you might
02:00 - find when you try to import the module
02:02 - it doesn't work
02:02 - if that's the case try again with python
02:05 - 3. if none of those work for you i'll
02:06 - leave some links to some videos in the
02:08 - description
02:09 - and you can click on those and they will
02:10 - show you how to fix and reinstall your
02:12 - pip
02:13 - so anyways once we've got that now what
02:15 - we need to do is actually start using
02:16 - this module
02:17 - so you can see kind of how this works on
02:19 - the left hand side of my screen all of
02:20 - the code here
02:22 - but to make sure we don't confuse anyone
02:23 - let's hop into a new file and i'll do
02:25 - this from scratch and show you exactly
02:26 - how this module works
02:28 - so the first thing we're going to need
02:29 - to do in our new python script is we're
02:31 - going to say import colorama
02:33 - then we're going to say from colorama
02:37 - import we're going to import four we're
02:39 - going to import back and we're going to
02:40 - import
02:41 - style now four back in style stand for
02:43 - the following
02:44 - four is foreground back is background
02:46 - and while style is just style
02:48 - so foreground will change your
02:50 - foreground color background will change
02:52 - your background color that will be like
02:54 - the highlight for the text
02:55 - and style will allow your text to either
02:57 - be bright dim or the
02:58 - normal kind of brightness for text in
03:00 - the terminal now the first thing that
03:02 - you always have to do when using the
03:03 - colorama module is you have to say
03:05 - colorama
03:06 - dot init like that this will simply
03:08 - initialize the module and make sure that
03:10 - the color codes that are stored from
03:12 - these three classes or three things that
03:14 - we're importing
03:15 - are actually going to function properly
03:16 - within your terminal or
03:18 - console whichever one you're using
03:20 - anyways let me just show you
03:21 - actually how color coding text works in
03:24 - the terminal so you can understand what
03:25 - this module is really doing
03:27 - so usually what you can do is you can
03:28 - take two lines that look like this
03:31 - and if you're on an operating system
03:32 - like linux or mac you should be able to
03:35 - without actually installing this module
03:37 - just print out this line so you have
03:38 - this fancy character here
03:40 - this actually stands for make our text
03:42 - red and then you concatenate it with
03:44 - some other text and all of the text
03:46 - after this character whether it's on the
03:48 - same line or not
03:49 - should be the color red so i'll show you
03:52 - just by
03:53 - actually running this script python
03:56 - tutorial dot pi
03:57 - that we get some red text by printing
03:59 - out this fancy character
04:00 - and notice that i didn't really use
04:02 - anything from this module
04:04 - but now watch what happens on windows if
04:05 - i actually remove this colorama dot init
04:08 - line so if i remove that and i try to do
04:10 - this
04:10 - notice that we get some weird characters
04:12 - printing out and well that color code
04:14 - just
04:14 - isn't working so usually on mac and
04:16 - linux these color codes will work
04:18 - no problem but on windows there's an
04:20 - issue in the terminal
04:21 - so what colorama actually does when you
04:23 - initialize it is it makes these color
04:25 - codes work
04:26 - so all this module is really doing is
04:28 - making these color codes work for you
04:30 - specifically on windows and then it's
04:32 - going to allow you to just use some
04:33 - nicer ways of styling your text rather
04:35 - than having to kind of memorize or
04:37 - look up what these specific color codes
04:39 - are so i can replace
04:40 - this color code here with the following
04:43 - 4
04:43 - dot red like that all this does is store
04:47 - the color code that we just showed right
04:49 - there and now if i print this out we get
04:51 - the exact same thing
04:52 - some red text so i just want to show you
04:55 - that's what this module is doing
04:56 - now by default if i don't actually do
04:59 - something else which i'll show you in a
05:00 - second if i try to print out some more
05:02 - text
05:02 - after this red text that text is going
05:05 - to show up red
05:06 - as well the reason for that is as soon
05:08 - as we see this special character it
05:10 - tells us that all of the text
05:11 - after this character should be read now
05:14 - what this character right here is is
05:16 - actually
05:16 - the clear character so it will clear
05:18 - whatever style was currently stored
05:20 - and that means that any text that comes
05:22 - after this will then be in the default
05:24 - styling so if i put this before print
05:26 - hello
05:27 - you can see when i run this that now we
05:29 - get this text and this is actually
05:30 - showing up properly
05:31 - now if we want to avoid having to clear
05:33 - the style every time we want to use a
05:35 - new style on a new line
05:37 - what we can do when we initialize
05:38 - colorama is we can say auto reset
05:41 - equals true and this will automatically
05:43 - reset the color of the text
05:44 - every time we print one line so now if i
05:47 - remove that clear character and i simply
05:49 - do this
05:50 - we get some red text and then we get
05:51 - hello so all you have to do is simply
05:54 - add this character before
05:55 - whatever text it is that you want to uh
05:57 - you want to show up that color so 4. red
06:00 - makes all this text show up red now of
06:02 - course there's a lot of other colors as
06:04 - well in fact let me bring in a list of
06:06 - all of them so that you can see
06:07 - these are the ones that you can use so
06:09 - you have black red
06:11 - green yellow let me move this over
06:13 - slightly magenta cyan white and then
06:15 - reset and then same thing for all of
06:17 - these
06:18 - so if you didn't have auto reset true
06:19 - what you could do to avoid having to do
06:21 - that fancy reset character
06:23 - is you can simply say 4 dot reset
06:26 - like that and well this will reset the
06:28 - color for you but since we have auto
06:30 - reset true
06:31 - we don't need to do that anyways let me
06:32 - show you some highlights and some other
06:34 - things as well
06:35 - so i'm just going to say back dot and i
06:38 - guess let's go with
06:39 - scion like that and then we can add that
06:42 - to
06:43 - scion let's go ahead and actually run
06:46 - this
06:47 - so now we get cyan as the highlight
06:49 - color for that text
06:51 - some other things that we can do is we
06:52 - can change the brightness so we can say
06:55 - style dot and then i believe we can just
06:57 - say bright
06:58 - and add that to some bright text like
07:00 - that and now
07:02 - if we run that in here you can see that
07:04 - this text is a little bit brighter than
07:05 - the default text in
07:07 - the terminal and of course you can
07:08 - combine styles to combine different
07:10 - styles or different colors and
07:12 - highlights
07:12 - what you can do is print something like
07:15 - four
07:16 - dot red plus back dot green
07:20 - plus and then we'll just say red text on
07:24 - green back all right we can go ahead and
07:26 - print that out
07:27 - you can see we get red text on a green
07:29 - background and because i am so nice i've
07:31 - included a link to this code file in the
07:33 - description which kind of shows you a
07:35 - bunch of different styles and the things
07:36 - that you can do
07:38 - inside of this i'm simply using an f
07:39 - string instead of concatenating
07:41 - different strings
07:42 - if you're not familiar with an f string
07:44 - it works in any version of python above
07:46 - 3.6 or
07:47 - equal to 3.6 but what you can do is
07:49 - simply type some expression
07:51 - inside of two curly braces like this and
07:53 - it will just show up
07:54 - in the string so i did something like 4
07:57 - dot
07:58 - red and then i said red then this would
08:00 - have a space
08:01 - and red text because it would simply
08:04 - evaluate this expression and put
08:06 - whatever its value is inside of the
08:07 - string
08:08 - anyways hopefully this gives you an idea
08:10 - of how to highlight text this will work
08:11 - again
08:12 - in windows linux and mac os and this
08:14 - should work in your default terminal
08:16 - now keep in mind i'm just going to print
08:18 - out this right here this actually does
08:20 - not work in my subline text terminal so
08:22 - something to consider that this isn't
08:24 - going to work in every single terminal
08:26 - or console it really depends which one
08:27 - you're using anyways i hope that was
08:29 - helpful if it was make sure you leave a
08:30 - like
08:31 - subscribe to the channel and i will see
08:32 - you in another youtube video
08:43 - you
