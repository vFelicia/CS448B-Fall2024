00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:02 - YouTube video so in today's video I'm
00:04 - going to be showing you how to make a
00:05 - random number guessing game in Python
00:08 - this is more of a beginner tutorial and
00:11 - this is for some of the viewers on my
00:13 - channel that maybe aren't us advanced
00:14 - with Python and don't know about classes
00:16 - and functions but this will allow you to
00:19 - learn a lot especially if you're a
00:20 - beginner and we're gonna go through the
00:21 - qual loops generating a random number
00:23 - getting input from the user checking
00:25 - that input and then obviously checking
00:27 - if that guess is correct versus the
00:29 - numbers so let's go ahead and get
00:30 - started so the first thing I want to do
00:32 - here is I'm just gonna import a module
00:34 - and this is random I'm gonna show you
00:36 - quickly how we can create a random
00:38 - number in Python that's why some of you
00:39 - might be here so to create a random
00:41 - number it's quite easy you just create a
00:43 - variable so our I would say is go to
00:45 - Rand int and then in here I just put two
00:48 - bounds and a bound is just like a start
00:50 - and end so if I put something like 1 4
00:52 - and then I print R to the screen I will
00:55 - get a number between 1 and 4 and that
00:58 - includes 1 and 4 as well so it'll
01:00 - randomly pick one so we can see here I
01:02 - get 2 if I run it again I get 4 keep
01:06 - running it you can see that we
01:07 - continually get random numbers so that's
01:09 - kind of the basis of what we're gonna
01:11 - need obviously to make a random number
01:13 - so the first thing I want to do when I'm
01:14 - coding this game is I'm just gonna set
01:16 - up a basic while loop and I want to ask
01:18 - the user to tell me how difficult I want
01:20 - the game to be and the way we're gonna
01:22 - do that is we're gonna ask them on what
01:25 - number they want to be able to guess up
01:26 - to so starting at 1 and then what number
01:29 - to guess up to so obviously the larger
01:30 - number they pick the heart of the game
01:32 - is gonna be so I'm going to make a while
01:33 - loop here so while flag and flag is set
01:35 - up to true and then say num is equal to
01:37 - input and type a number for an upper
01:44 - bound okay I know that sounds
01:47 - complicated but just means like what we
01:48 - guess up to so this is gonna grab our
01:50 - input from the user
01:52 - store it in the variable num so now what
01:54 - I want to do is I want to check if this
01:56 - variable num is a integer or not because
02:00 - if they don't type in a number well I
02:02 - don't want to allow them to continue at
02:04 - the game because we don't know what
02:05 - number we should go up to so the way we
02:06 - do this is actually really easy and
02:09 - so we can do an if statement I say if
02:10 - num oops one my typing bum they're numb
02:15 - nut is digit like this and what this is
02:18 - gonna check is if this string because
02:20 - whenever we grab input from the user
02:21 - comes in a string is equal to a number
02:24 - then we're gonna move on and we're gonna
02:26 - say okay let's play the game here's what
02:29 - we're guessing up to so on now if they
02:31 - don't say that I'm going to set up an
02:33 - else here and we'll go into that in a
02:34 - second so if this is a digit they've
02:36 - typed in some correct input we're gonna
02:37 - say print and I don't know how I did
02:42 - that I'll say let's play like that okay
02:46 - so let's play let's an exclamation point
02:49 - here as well and now what I'm gonna do
02:50 - is I'm gonna convert this into an
02:52 - integer and the way that we can do that
02:54 - just say Namie equals int num
02:57 - and then I'm going to say flag is equal
03:00 - to false so that we can get out of this
03:03 - while loop and then down here so where
03:05 - my mouse is kind of hovering is where
03:06 - we're gonna actually play the real game
03:08 - up here is just where we're getting the
03:10 - input for what to guess up to so let's
03:12 - say they don't type in a valid number
03:15 - they type in like hello for the upper
03:16 - bound well we don't know what to do with
03:18 - that so we're simply gonna tell them
03:20 - invalid input like that and I know I
03:25 - spelled invalid wrong just ignore it for
03:27 - now try again
03:30 - like that okay so let's fix this invalid
03:34 - input try again and then this is gonna
03:37 - prompt them to continually type in
03:39 - numbers until they eventually give us a
03:41 - number that is a digit or a string
03:43 - whatever it that is a digit and it will
03:45 - print let's play and we'll move forward
03:47 - so let's just test this out before you
03:48 - look too far so we say type a number I'm
03:50 - gonna say hi it's gonna say invalid
03:52 - input try again let's do let's try this
03:54 - negative seven invalid input try again
03:57 - how about seventy six there we go let's
03:59 - play and that works
04:00 - now the reason negatives don't work
04:01 - because technically a dash is not a
04:04 - digit and we only want numbers that are
04:06 - above one anyway so this actually works
04:07 - well for us okay so now we're going to
04:10 - start our main game so we need to
04:13 - generate a number that the user is gonna
04:14 - try to guess within their bound so to do
04:17 - this I'm gonna type secret let's give it
04:19 - a variable name for the number
04:20 - because it is gonna be a secret to the
04:22 - user I type random dot R and int 1 and
04:26 - then that bound so that bound is num and
04:29 - that is what they typed in and we've
04:31 - already made sure that this is indeed a
04:33 - number and it's not a string so this
04:35 - will work well in our random grant int
04:37 - okay so now I'm gonna set up two
04:39 - variables I'm gonna say guess is equal
04:41 - to none and I'm gonna say count is equal
04:46 - to 1 I'll go over what these do in just
04:48 - a minute so pretty much our guess is
04:50 - just set to none by default because we
04:52 - haven't yet made a guess and that our
04:54 - count is equal to 1 because we want to
04:58 - tell the user how many times it took
04:59 - them to get the correct number so I'm
05:03 - gonna set up another while loop now and
05:04 - the condition I'm going to use for this
05:06 - is a little different than some of you
05:08 - might typically use I'm gonna say well
05:10 - guess does not equal secret like that
05:14 - and that's gonna say we're gonna
05:16 - continually keep guessing until our
05:19 - guests ends up being secret or like the
05:22 - number that we're trying to guess which
05:23 - is secret like this and in that case we
05:26 - will stop and we will do whatever comes
05:30 - after ok so now I'm going to say in here
05:32 - I want to ask the user to guess so to do
05:35 - this we're gonna say guest is equal to
05:38 - input and then same thing here please
05:42 - type a number and I'm just gonna say
05:45 - good between 1 and and now I'm gonna put
05:49 - in the number that they typed in so num
05:51 - between 1 and num and we'll do another
05:55 - comma like this and I'm just gonna put a
05:57 - colon actually I don't think I could put
06:00 - calm as an input sir we're just gonna
06:01 - have to ignore that for one second
06:03 - because it's gonna crash you just have
06:05 - to do like this ok so what I've done
06:09 - here because in the print statement
06:10 - we're allowed to use commas in the input
06:12 - statement we're not so we have to make
06:14 - sure everything is a string so we're
06:16 - gonna say please type a number between 1
06:18 - and and then we're gonna convert our
06:20 - number into a string and then we're
06:22 - gonna add a colon here so that they can
06:24 - kind of type after it and these spaces
06:26 - are important otherwise you're gonna see
06:27 - they'll be mushed together if you don't
06:28 - have the space after the quotation marks
06:30 - ok so now that we've done that we want
06:32 - to do the same thing that we did up here
06:34 - and
06:34 - make sure that this guess is indeed a
06:36 - digit so let's say if num it's I guess
06:40 - not not guess done is digit like this
06:44 - then we will convert our guests into an
06:47 - integer so guess equals int guess like
06:51 - that now the reason that we need to do
06:53 - this and check if it's a digit and I'll
06:55 - show I'll show you when I open up the
06:58 - editor here okay so let's just get
07:01 - through this like 54 oh okay it's just
07:05 - gonna keep going anyways if I open up
07:06 - ideally I can show you I spoke later
07:08 - just give me a second okay so let's say
07:10 - if I say X is equal to hello like that
07:13 - and then I put something like this and I
07:14 - say int X well it says in built in a
07:17 - roll for int with base 10 so for example
07:21 - if we didn't check if someone our if
07:23 - what they typed in was an integer and we
07:25 - tried to convert it into an int it would
07:27 - crash our program and obviously we don't
07:29 - want our program to crash we want to
07:31 - just keep asking until eventually they
07:33 - type in a correct number so that's why
07:35 - we need to do that and now I'm gonna say
07:37 - if guess equals equals secret like that
07:43 - then we can tell the user well you
07:46 - guessed the correct number so we'll say
07:48 - you've got it and I don't know I can't
07:52 - type today okay you got it like that
07:54 - otherwise so if the user did not guess
07:58 - the number correctly we're gonna say
08:00 - please try again like that now one other
08:06 - thing we need to do here and some of you
08:08 - may have already thought of it is we
08:09 - have this variable count so if the user
08:12 - gets it wrong we won't add one to our
08:14 - count like this indicating that they're
08:18 - getting another try to guess the number
08:20 - okay so I know I went kind of fast I'm
08:23 - just going to type one last line then
08:24 - we're gonna test the program and go
08:25 - through it one more time because
08:26 - anyone's confused okay
08:27 - so I'm just gonna print down here
08:29 - because once the guess is not equal to
08:32 - so once the guess is equal to secret
08:34 - we're not gonna be going through this
08:36 - wall loop anymore because this condition
08:37 - is not true because the two things will
08:40 - indeed be the same value and we're gonna
08:42 - print what comes so what comes out for
08:45 - this while loop is the print statement
08:46 - and we're just gonna say it took you
08:47 - this many tries
08:48 - it took you in here we can use commas
08:52 - count and that will say guesses like
08:56 - that with an exclamation point so let's
09:00 - go ahead and run the program and it's
09:02 - gonna say type a number for an up bound
09:04 - I don't want to be here for too long so
09:05 - I'm going to type six once up say let's
09:08 - play please type a number between one
09:09 - and six type four please try again okay
09:12 - I look three okay that didn't work to
09:15 - one oh is it really gonna be the last
09:19 - one
09:19 - six you got it it took you six guesses
09:22 - and there we go that is indeed our game
09:26 - and you can play this as many times as
09:28 - you you want and if you wanted to
09:29 - continually keep playing this and have
09:32 - it to keep asking you and keep asking
09:34 - you to type in a number and then - sorry
09:39 - type in a number for an upper bound and
09:41 - then type in another number and try to
09:42 - guess it you can put another while
09:44 - statement so I'll put something like
09:45 - this well true if you take all this and
09:49 - indent it now we'll do this quickly so
09:52 - if I type it upper bound three and I
09:53 - type one you got it it took you one
09:55 - guesses or I guess I should probably say
09:57 - guess not guesses anyways type a number
10:00 - for an upper bound so it's asking me
10:02 - again so I'll type 3 type number 21 and
10:05 - 3 type 2 you got it it took you one
10:08 - guess and you can continually and
10:10 - continually keep playing and this will
10:12 - never stop so if you keep if you can
10:14 - play as long as you want and if you want
10:15 - to exit this you can just click the red
10:16 - X or you can click ctrl C on your
10:18 - keyboard and that will break the while
10:20 - loop because this is indeed and
10:22 - infinitely anyways that's been it for
10:24 - this video I hope you guys enjoyed and
10:26 - you now know how to make a random number
10:28 - just guessing game if you did please
10:31 - make sure you leave a like and subscribe
10:33 - and I'll see you again in the next video
