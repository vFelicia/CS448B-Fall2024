00:06 - hello and welcome now if you can't
00:09 - already tell this is gonna be a very
00:11 - special and very different video than
00:14 - anything I've ever posted on my channel
00:16 - before and obviously that is because
00:18 - well you can see me and this is the
00:20 - official kind of face reveal of tech
00:23 - with Tim now I hadn't been planning on
00:25 - doing this doing this I hadn't really
00:26 - announced it was kind of just a
00:27 - spur-of-the-moment thing
00:29 - I saw webcam on Amazon it was on sale I
00:31 - was like you know what let's just pick
00:32 - it up I feel like it might be a bit more
00:34 - engaging with maybe when I'm explaining
00:35 - certain things or doing some my tutorial
00:38 - videos if you have a chance to just kind
00:39 - of look at me in the bottom right hand
00:41 - corner of the screen so that way if
00:42 - there's not a lot going on on the screen
00:43 - then it's something that's more engaging
00:46 - that you can kind of watch while you
00:47 - listen so anyways I'd like to hear your
00:49 - thoughts on this guys what do you think
00:51 - about is this what you thought I looked
00:52 - like is this a my completely different
00:55 - than you had imagined I don't know I'm
00:56 - kind of curious to see what people had
00:57 - imagined about me in their brain and
01:00 - anyways I just want to talk about a few
01:02 - things in this video first of all I just
01:04 - want to share some information about
01:05 - myself because a lot of you guys asked
01:07 - me a lot of questions and you asked like
01:09 - what do I do
01:10 - how did I learn programming that kind of
01:12 - questions like that so I feel like if I
01:14 - can answer some of those in this video
01:15 - that might give you guys some value some
01:17 - information about myself you guys can
01:18 - get to know me and I also just want to
01:20 - talk about some of the future stuff
01:21 - that's gonna be coming on the channel
01:22 - and some of the stuff that I already
01:23 - have that I think some of you guys that
01:25 - are new subscribers might not know about
01:27 - because in the Matt past month or so
01:29 - I've been gaining a lot of subscribers
01:30 - and a lot of views and I have to say
01:32 - again a massive thank you to everyone
01:34 - that watches videos that likes that
01:36 - shares comments is subscribed it's
01:39 - absolutely amazing keeps me going every
01:40 - day so first of all I guess I'll just
01:42 - talk about kind of some of the stuff I
01:44 - have on the channel that you guys might
01:45 - not know about so I'm just gonna go to
01:47 - playlist here and go to create a
01:49 - playlist and this is what you guys can
01:50 - do too and this will guide you on all
01:52 - YouTube channels whenever I go to view
01:53 - the miter scroll look at all their
01:54 - playlists I have a ton of videos on a
01:56 - bunch of Python programming so a lot of
01:58 - people ask me like hey I'm trying to
02:00 - learn Python programming the PI game
02:01 - stuffs too hard I'm like man just go to
02:03 - my channel like I have beginner Python
02:06 - tutorials I have tons of other game
02:08 - development tutorials like
02:09 - side-scrolling tutorial I
02:11 - intermediate Python tutorials Tetris
02:14 - snake have some module tutorials where I
02:17 - talk about the turtle module the numpy
02:19 - module pycharm I have all kinds of stuff
02:22 - so just look through there and I'm sure
02:23 - you guys will find some other stuff that
02:24 - you're interested in
02:25 - I just finished two classes and objects
02:27 - tutorial series for any of you that were
02:28 - kind of confused when I did
02:29 - object-oriented programming especially
02:31 - my PI game stuff um so yeah also I just
02:35 - want to say make sure you guys are
02:36 - keeping an eye out on the community tab
02:37 - here I've started to post and I'm
02:39 - probably gonna be posting like once a
02:40 - week just giving us some updates about
02:42 - what's going on what's coming next to
02:44 - the channel and for any of you that have
02:46 - been following this you knew that today
02:47 - was gonna be a special video because I
02:48 - kind of announced it on here and that
02:51 - the machine learning stuff is coming
02:52 - kind of near the end of January
02:53 - mid-january and that Java tutorials will
02:56 - be here very soon I'm almost finishing
02:58 - finished recording all of them so I just
03:00 - have to kind of edit them go through
03:01 - them get everything working with that
03:04 - and then they're gonna be on the channel
03:05 - now in terms of just some information
03:07 - about myself because I did tell you I
03:09 - was gonna answer some questions I just
03:11 - like to say first of all I'm 18 years
03:12 - old I live in Canada and I am in my
03:15 - first year of computer science and
03:17 - actually just wrapping up my first
03:18 - semester as of recording this video
03:20 - right now and pretty much what that
03:23 - means for you guys is that everything
03:25 - that I learned through computer science
03:27 - and all the stuff that I'm doing
03:28 - throughout my four-year five-year degree
03:29 - is is gonna be posted on this channel
03:33 - completely for free and that's really
03:35 - the goal here is to give you guys all of
03:37 - that information completely for free and
03:40 - obviously I'm going to be adding my own
03:41 - touches to it teaching you stuff that I
03:42 - haven't learned so make sure you guys
03:44 - just subscribe for the long run because
03:46 - I'm gonna be showing you guys some
03:47 - pretty cool stuff I'm excited about it I
03:50 - hope you guys are excited about it as
03:51 - well now in terms of myself a lot of
03:54 - people ask me like how to get into
03:56 - programming how'd you learn it like what
03:57 - what's so cool about it would not well
03:59 - when I was really young like I was just
04:01 - really into technology and computers I
04:03 - just found them fascinating so I kind of
04:05 - I don't even know what got me onto it I
04:07 - think I just looked up like coding or
04:08 - something online one day and anyways I
04:11 - ended up learning HTML like a full like
04:13 - HTML course this is what I'm like 12 and
04:16 - then I taught myself like CSS like all
04:19 - that stuff I was doing all this HTML
04:21 - stuff eventually that led me into
04:23 - learning JavaScript
04:24 - and then once I got into JavaScript like
04:26 - I was really interested in making my own
04:27 - websites and stuff so I started learning
04:30 - like MySQL and PHP this is to keep your
04:32 - timeframe around like 13 14 years old
04:35 - and then I kind of just didn't really
04:37 - like the web development stuff anymore
04:40 - like I was learning about all this cool
04:42 - stuff you could do with JavaScript like
04:43 - all this dynamic programming based on
04:45 - like user input I was like well is there
04:48 - any way I can move out of this cuz I
04:49 - don't really like any of the graphic
04:50 - design stuff if you guys can't tell if
04:52 - you've seen any of my videos where I
04:53 - have handwriting like I'm the worst
04:55 - artist you probably ever see so I
04:57 - started learning c-sharp actually off a
04:59 - recommendation from one of my dad's
05:01 - friends who is a programmer himself and
05:04 - he said it was a decent first language
05:06 - to learn like a real language and I was
05:08 - like okay sure so I learned that don't
05:11 - know if that was probably the best
05:12 - language to start off with learning but
05:13 - anyways kind of got decent at bat by the
05:16 - time I was like 14 15 years old and then
05:18 - getting into high school and taking my
05:21 - first like computer science class like
05:23 - programming class whatever you want to
05:24 - call it I had to learn Python is that's
05:26 - the language they were teaching so I
05:28 - learned that I'm sure you guys can
05:30 - obviously tell I fell in love with
05:31 - Python keep like I've been using Python
05:34 - since I started learning that honestly
05:36 - if you ask me to program in C sharp
05:37 - right now I could probably do like a
05:39 - little bit but I hardly remember any of
05:41 - the syntax from because I haven't used
05:42 - it in so long and now that I'm in
05:44 - university I've just recently started
05:46 - teaching myself Java because I know that
05:48 - I'm gonna have to be learning Java next
05:49 - semester like in a course so started
05:51 - teaching myself Java got pretty good at
05:53 - that and now I'm gonna be teaching that
05:54 - to you guys so in terms of the way I go
05:57 - about kind of learning programming
05:59 - languages now that I'm at the point
06:01 - where I know most of the basis like a
06:04 - lot of people always tell you right once
06:05 - you learn one you can learn any other
06:07 - one and that's pretty much true for the
06:09 - basics of the language but once you
06:12 - start getting into some of the advanced
06:13 - stuff languages are very different in
06:15 - terms of the way that they work in
06:17 - memory and certain functionality they
06:20 - have things that you can actually do
06:21 - with them in terms like cross-platform
06:22 - compatibility as well so yeah so once
06:26 - you learn like a basics and the way I do
06:28 - that is I usually just go online I look
06:30 - up like Java tutorial I find some like
06:33 - text online and I just read it like I
06:36 - just read the text and
06:37 - and I literally learn the syntax and I
06:40 - go on to like Eclipse or whatever IDE
06:42 - and I just try to make something like
06:44 - I'll only spend like a few hours
06:45 - actually looking at syntax and reading
06:48 - or watching videos or why not and then
06:50 - I'll just go on and I'll just try to do
06:51 - something and or like I'll follow like a
06:54 - video tutorial of someone doing
06:56 - something like making a game or making a
06:57 - project because I find that that is the
07:00 - absol
07:01 - because when you're doing that you're
07:03 - trying to accomplish something you run
07:05 - into like like a small project per se
07:08 - okay you run into a ton of errors you
07:10 - make a ton of mistakes and that's the
07:12 - best way that you can learn because
07:14 - every time you make a mistake every time
07:15 - you make an error and you don't know
07:16 - what the issue is you have to go online
07:18 - look it up research it and once you've
07:20 - done that for yourself you haven't just
07:22 - had someone tell you the answer you
07:24 - remember it a lot more and that's really
07:26 - the way that I learned all my
07:27 - programming is I go i watch some videos
07:30 - i do some syntax for a few hours and
07:31 - then i just try to make something and by
07:33 - making something i'm looking up and i'm
07:34 - constantly learning as i'm doing that
07:36 - and i'm making mistakes and whenever i
07:39 - make a mistake then i learned from that
07:40 - mistake i remember that mistake and if i
07:42 - make it again i know how to fix it and
07:44 - typically it doesn't happen too often
07:46 - right and that's what i always recommend
07:48 - to anyone who asked me how can i
07:50 - remember all this how can i do all this
07:51 - will i say well it's awesome you want to
07:53 - start off watching videos learning the
07:55 - syntax getting the basis down maybe
07:57 - following along like a project video
07:58 - with something but then step out of that
08:00 - and try to do something by yourself like
08:02 - pick something that's like somewhat
08:03 - challenging but not kind of crazy
08:05 - difficult and just try to make that and
08:08 - if you can make that and you can
08:10 - accomplish that not only do you now have
08:11 - like an awesome thing that you just
08:12 - created yourself which i think is
08:14 - amazing that you can do on a computer in
08:15 - like a few hours of your spare time but
08:17 - you just learned a ton anyways this has
08:21 - just been a little bit about tech with
08:23 - Tim just doing a few answering a few
08:25 - questions kind of talking to you guys
08:26 - letting you guys get to know me now if
08:28 - there's anything if you want to see a
08:29 - video like this again in the future like
08:31 - like a QA something like that let me
08:34 - know ask me some questions and yeah so
08:37 - with that being said I hope you guys
08:39 - enjoy the video thanks again for all the
08:41 - support that I've been getting recently
08:43 - that's amazing and I'll see you again in
08:45 - another video
08:49 - [Music]
