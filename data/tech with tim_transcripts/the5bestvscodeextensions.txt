00:00 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:01 - youtube video today i wanted to make a
00:03 - shorter video showcasing five
00:05 - awesome extensions for visual studio
00:07 - code i won't be giving you a full demo
00:09 - or tutorial on any of these extensions
00:11 - but just briefly discussing what they do
00:13 - and showcasing some of their
00:14 - functionality so with that said let's
00:16 - dive in
00:20 - [Music]
00:26 - so i'm going to start by showing you how
00:27 - to install an extension it's pretty
00:29 - simple
00:30 - all you need to do is open up visual
00:31 - studio code click on the extensions pane
00:34 - and then you can search for different
00:35 - extensions in the vs code marketplace
00:37 - now once you find the extension you want
00:39 - you can just press install vs code may
00:41 - need to reload and then once it does
00:43 - you've installed the extension you can
00:44 - start using it
00:45 - once you've installed all the extensions
00:46 - you can manage them enable them disable
00:48 - them
00:49 - and so on within the extensions list so
00:51 - if you open up the extensions tab you'll
00:53 - see all the extensions you have
00:54 - installed there
00:55 - and then you can also select and install
00:56 - extension and press the gear icon to
00:59 - manage its specific
01:00 - settings alright so the first extension
01:02 - i have to show you is called code spell
01:03 - checker
01:04 - this extension does exactly what it says
01:06 - it checks for spelling mistakes as you
01:07 - write code
01:08 - by default vs code will check some
01:10 - spelling but it's not the best and only
01:12 - does so in specific file types but code
01:14 - spell checker will highlight any word it
01:16 - sees
01:16 - that is not in the dictionary and
01:18 - provides spelling suggestions for you
01:20 - it's smart enough to understand camel
01:22 - case snake case pascal case etc
01:24 - and it won't flag compound words in
01:26 - things like variable names
01:27 - to fix a word that's spelled incorrectly
01:29 - you can press on the quick
01:30 - fix button that appears after
01:32 - highlighting the word so putting your
01:33 - cursor
01:34 - over any of those blue squiggly lines or
01:36 - you can simply press
01:37 - control plus period that's the keyboard
01:39 - shortcut that will bring up all of the
01:41 - suggestions for the different words
01:43 - so the next extension on my list is
01:45 - called prettier prettier is a very
01:47 - popular extension that provides auto
01:49 - code formatting for most programming
01:50 - languages
01:51 - it's especially useful in html
01:53 - javascript and other languages where
01:55 - there's a lot of nested blocks and
01:56 - opening and closing tags
01:58 - after you install prettier you can
01:59 - configure your formatting by pressing
02:01 - control plus
02:02 - shift plus p or command shift p on mac
02:06 - and that is going to open up the command
02:07 - palette once the command palette is open
02:09 - you can type format
02:11 - there should be something there that
02:12 - says uh format document with
02:14 - you can press that and then select your
02:16 - default formatter if you do have
02:17 - multiple of them
02:18 - for most of you you'll probably just
02:20 - have one and then you'll just have one
02:21 - option to select obviously
02:22 - now by default whenever you save your
02:24 - document prettier will actually format
02:26 - it for you
02:27 - so if you want to manually format your
02:29 - document not by saving
02:31 - what you can do is simply open up the
02:32 - command palette and you can use
02:34 - format document with select the
02:36 - formatter and then it will format the
02:37 - document for you
02:38 - now if you want to save your document
02:40 - without formatting it because sometimes
02:42 - it will format stuff that you don't want
02:44 - what you can do is open up the command
02:45 - palette again
02:47 - and then you can simply press save
02:48 - without formatting
02:50 - now if you want to change any of the
02:51 - default behavior of prettier what you
02:53 - can do is select the printer extension
02:55 - from your extensions tab
02:57 - press on the little settings or gear
02:59 - icon and then select
03:00 - the extension settings that will allow
03:02 - you to look through some of the options
03:04 - there and change kind of how it's
03:05 - formatting and what file extensions it
03:06 - will format for
03:08 - lastly though if you want to make it so
03:10 - that by default your document is not
03:12 - going to be formatted on save
03:14 - what you have to do is go into the vs
03:16 - code settings
03:17 - so go into the vs code settings that's
03:18 - the big gear icon
03:20 - then you can type format and you should
03:22 - see some option that says format
03:24 - on save just uncheck that and then that
03:26 - will remove that default behavior
03:28 - moving on the third extension i have to
03:30 - show you is called bracket colorizer 2.
03:32 - this is the new version of the original
03:34 - bracket colorizer that simply colors
03:36 - corresponding brackets
03:38 - such that it's easier to see where each
03:40 - block starts and ends now we'll do that
03:41 - with parentheses
03:42 - brackets angle brackets square brackets
03:45 - squiggly brackets all the different type
03:46 - of brackets
03:47 - and really there's not much more to say
03:49 - about this one some people love this
03:50 - extension
03:51 - some people hate it and think it looks
03:52 - silly let me know you think of it in the
03:54 - comments down below
03:55 - now the next extension i have to show
03:57 - you is called get lens
03:59 - so this is an add-on for git now git is
04:02 - integrated by default in vs code and so
04:04 - you can already do a lot of get related
04:06 - stuff in visual studio code but what git
04:08 - lens allows you to do is see more
04:10 - information about the code that you're
04:12 - working in in the git repository so
04:14 - specifically you can see things like
04:15 - authorship
04:16 - modifications you can go and look
04:18 - through all of the commit history and
04:19 - just gives you a better user interface
04:21 - than the default interface you have
04:23 - with vs code by default what it also
04:26 - does is provide file annotations related
04:28 - to commits
04:29 - authorships and also provides a bunch of
04:31 - different views for navigating revisions
04:32 - and changes
04:33 - so to demonstrate this i'll open up the
04:35 - commit view by going to the version
04:37 - control pane in vs code
04:38 - and then toggling the commit sidebar
04:40 - menu here you can see
04:42 - and view all of the commit history file
04:44 - changes and more related to the current
04:46 - repository
04:47 - and as you can see here there's a bunch
04:48 - of other different views you can click
04:49 - on so below
04:51 - the commit view you can look at the file
04:52 - history view the branch view
04:54 - so on and so forth now the final
04:56 - extension i have to show you is
04:58 - extremely useful especially if you work
05:00 - with vs code on multiple machines
05:02 - and that is called settings sync now as
05:04 - the name suggests this will allow you to
05:06 - sync all of your vs code settings
05:08 - keybinds extensions extension settings
05:10 - and more across all of your different
05:12 - devices
05:12 - you do need to manually configure and
05:14 - install this extension on all of your
05:16 - different devices before this will work
05:18 - but it's pretty straightforward to do
05:19 - that you simply install the extension
05:22 - sign up with github and then it's going
05:23 - to ask you to select an existing gist
05:26 - or to skip and then it will create one
05:28 - for you this is something that's kind of
05:29 - stored by github
05:30 - then what you can do once you've set up
05:32 - your gist is you can use shift alt
05:34 - u to upload all of your settings and
05:36 - shift alt d
05:37 - to download all of your settings now if
05:40 - you're on mac you can simply replace the
05:42 - alt key with the option key in those
05:43 - commands so
05:44 - shift option u shift option d to upload
05:47 - and download respectively
05:49 - now there's a bunch of other settings
05:50 - you can mess around with this so i'd
05:52 - recommend you read through the extension
05:53 - home page
05:54 - the one that you get when you actually
05:55 - just click on the extension before you
05:57 - upload or download any of your settings
05:59 - because you can kind of mess it up
06:00 - pretty easily if you don't know what
06:01 - you're doing
06:02 - but i found this extension extremely
06:03 - useful if you spend a few minutes
06:04 - reading about it
06:05 - it definitely saves you a ton of time
06:07 - especially if you're working on multiple
06:08 - machines like i do all the time with vs
06:11 - code
06:11 - alright so there you go those are five
06:13 - great vs code extensions that you can
06:15 - use regardless of the language you're
06:16 - using in vs code now before i end the
06:18 - video i'll mention that there are many
06:20 - other great extensions as well
06:22 - but many of these are language specifics
06:24 - like the python extension
06:25 - reactant js snippets cnc plus plus
06:29 - go jupiter so on and so forth there's
06:31 - like hundreds of thousands of extensions
06:32 - for visual studio code
06:34 - now if you're working in a specific
06:35 - language obviously it makes sense to
06:37 - install that language's respective
06:38 - extensions if you're working in python
06:40 - install the python extension all right
06:42 - so with that said i'm going to end
06:44 - the video here let me know what you guys
06:45 - thought of this video do you like these
06:47 - kind of shorter type
06:48 - videos where it's just very quick
06:49 - information not going into a ton of
06:50 - detail or do you prefer
06:52 - more detailed in-depth explanations of
06:54 - all of this stuff
06:55 - anyways let me know hope you guys
06:56 - enjoyed if you did make sure that a like
06:58 - subscribe and i will see you in
06:59 - another one
