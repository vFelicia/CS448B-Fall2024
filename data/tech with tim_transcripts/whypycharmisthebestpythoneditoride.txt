00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:02 - video in today's video I'm gonna be
00:04 - telling you about my favorite IDE for
00:06 - Python development and coding and I'm
00:09 - going over why this is my favorite and
00:11 - kind of showing you a quick glimpse of
00:13 - what this can do so pretty much an IDE
00:15 - is an integrated development environment
00:17 - and it's a little bit more advanced than
00:20 - a basic text editor as it has a lot of
00:22 - tools that can help you when coding and
00:24 - it saves you a lot of time it makes
00:26 - things a lot easier to organize and just
00:29 - to look at in general so a lot of you
00:31 - might notice that I typically code in
00:33 - the standard IDL e it looks something
00:35 - like this we have like a blank file
00:37 - there's nothing special there's no real
00:39 - tools like we have this format tool
00:41 - that's about it this IDE is way better
00:45 - it's called pycharm and I'm gonna be
00:48 - telling you why so the reason I haven't
00:49 - since now been using pycharm for a lot
00:52 - of my videos is because I wanted to test
00:54 - it out and make sure that it really was
00:56 - my favorite and it was good before I
00:57 - introduced it to you guys so I can say
00:59 - now after using it for a few months that
01:01 - I'm pretty comfortable with it and it's
01:03 - much much better than ideally the basic
01:07 - Python text editor so this is what's
01:09 - gonna look what its gonna look like when
01:10 - you download and open up high term for
01:13 - the first time so you can go to this
01:14 - download page which I'm gonna leave in
01:15 - the description down below and just
01:17 - download this community version it's
01:18 - completely free and it has all the
01:21 - features you're gonna need there's not
01:22 - much you need there's not much in the
01:24 - professional version that will really
01:25 - make it that much better experience this
01:28 - is more if you're working with a large
01:29 - team community works better for I don't
01:32 - know individuals so it's gonna look
01:34 - something like this
01:35 - you can either open a project or create
01:36 - a new project in this case I'm gonna
01:37 - open a project just a typical Python
01:39 - project um
01:41 - so pretty much I'm gonna just gonna go
01:43 - to desktop and just find one on here
01:45 - Python let's just open up machine
01:49 - learning for example okay so open up
01:51 - this one and you can see it starts
01:53 - loading us up into a project and already
01:55 - it's giving us tips on cool key bindings
01:58 - and things that we can use in
02:00 - pycharm so that's the name of this IDE
02:03 - and the way this works is it's project
02:05 - based so a project is just pretty much
02:07 - any folder and then if it has any Python
02:09 - files within it all of those are going
02:11 - to be to the same project so you can
02:13 - have multiple
02:13 - within a project and you can create your
02:16 - own projects you can open existing
02:17 - projects and they all have their own
02:19 - settings that you can save within them
02:21 - which makes it really useful so let's
02:22 - just go through kind of the ID Heat IDE
02:24 - here the basic stuff so there's a
02:26 - project tab this is what's gonna show
02:28 - you all of your basic basic files all
02:29 - the things that's in the working
02:30 - directory you have all your files up
02:33 - here so whenever I want to open a new
02:34 - file so and open
02:35 - what's one I don't have open neural
02:37 - networks I just double click on that
02:38 - I'll just open up in this tabbed view
02:40 - and then I can flip between all these
02:42 - files which already makes it really
02:44 - useful if you're working on multiple
02:45 - files or you want to copy and paste
02:46 - things you have to be moving them around
02:47 - your screen you can also split things
02:50 - horizontally and vertically so if I left
02:52 - click on this or right click on it and
02:53 - click split vertically you can see it
02:55 - shows up on the right here I can do the
02:56 - same thing with horizontally so it goes
02:58 - down or it's like that and yeah they
03:02 - also have this really cool structure tab
03:03 - which I just recently found out about
03:05 - actually I know I've been using it for a
03:07 - while but if you click structure it's
03:08 - actually gonna show you the entire
03:10 - structure of your code so I'll make this
03:12 - bigger and you can see that it goes
03:13 - through my class of this pixel class
03:15 - which I have open here and it shows me
03:17 - all of the methods that I have all of
03:19 - the variables the attributes and all of
03:22 - those cool things which is really useful
03:24 - so if you have a long or big files and
03:27 - you want to quickly find something for
03:28 - example I want to find my grade class I
03:30 - can just click on the grade class here
03:31 - on structure it'll bring me right to it
03:33 - and then it lists off again all the
03:36 - methods that I've made and some of the
03:39 - properties that this has so like Len
03:41 - pixels whatever you can go through that
03:43 - it also has variables and functions so
03:46 - guess like this is a function main is a
03:49 - function brings me to that and then
03:51 - these are just my global variables that
03:52 - I have defined and when I click it it
03:55 - brings me right to it so speaking of
03:57 - global variables there's a really cool
03:59 - thing that
04:00 - pycharm dozen it's called refactoring or
04:03 - refract during something like that
04:05 - excuse the thing but anyways if I could
04:07 - click on a variable so highlight it and
04:09 - I right click and I click refactor
04:11 - that's what it is refactor and then I
04:13 - click rename I can change this to for
04:15 - example with like that
04:17 - click refactor and now it actually
04:20 - changes all of the other variables so
04:22 - you saw how to W here it changes that to
04:24 - width changes this one to width same
04:26 - thing I can show you if ID
04:27 - with high tango refactor rename so
04:30 - changing h2 height like that it will
04:34 - change all of the variables within my
04:35 - file here that are named that same thing
04:37 - so this makes it a lot easier if you
04:39 - need to change a variable name which you
04:41 - will have to do a lot in Python to be
04:44 - able to do that okay so next thing I
04:46 - guess to show is just running the file
04:49 - so a lot of people when you download pie
04:50 - chart can confuse on how running files
04:52 - works so the way it works in PyCharm is
04:54 - your what do you call it your project
04:57 - has configurations and they're up here
04:59 - where this says draw number here yours
05:01 - would just say edit configurations or
05:02 - add new configuration to run your files
05:05 - this is a bit complicated but it's
05:07 - really useful once you learn how to do
05:08 - it you just click Edit configurations or
05:10 - add new and then up here in this top
05:12 - left hand corner you can click + select
05:16 - Python as your what your interpreter and
05:18 - then your gonna give a name to your
05:20 - configuration and this is what you're
05:21 - gonna select what is it when you want to
05:24 - run a certain file so you want to name
05:26 - it appropriately to the file you're
05:27 - gonna run for example in this project I
05:29 - have multiple Python files that I could
05:31 - run so if I want to around neural
05:33 - networks I would want to name this one
05:34 - neural oops networks like this so that I
05:39 - know which one I'm clicking to run so
05:41 - then you're gonna go do script path
05:43 - click this little folder icon here and
05:46 - you can simply just find that Python
05:48 - file and it you can run files from this
05:50 - configuration that aren't within the
05:51 - project which is really nice too so I'm
05:53 - gonna click neural networks and then I
05:55 - can also select my Python interpreter a
05:57 - lot of you are probably just gonna have
05:59 - a default like Python 3.7 but you can
06:01 - see that I actually have many different
06:04 - interpreters these because I have Conda
06:06 - interpreter as well so I'm just going to
06:08 - select Python 37 as my main one and then
06:11 - click apply and ok so now if I want to
06:15 - run neural networks I could simply click
06:16 - this run icon here and I'm actually just
06:19 - going to run main so I'll run main and
06:21 - you can see that it pops up a thing here
06:24 - just wait a second it's gonna open up a
06:26 - PI game window in one minute I believe
06:29 - and yeah so it's going through all this
06:31 - whatever and then I can click stop to
06:33 - stop the program at any time that I want
06:37 - so there's also a few things down here
06:39 - so we have run this is obviously what
06:41 - happens when I
06:42 - running your program and you can run
06:43 - multiple instances of programs at once
06:45 - so you can see if I ran a different file
06:48 - so if I run like draw number then
06:51 - another one will come up here and you
06:52 - can close out of them and delete them as
06:55 - you like there's a terminal and this is
06:57 - pretty much like your CMD so if you want
07:00 - to install packages or do stuff like
07:01 - that you can do that right from pycharm
07:03 - and there's a standard Python console so
07:06 - if I run this and I typed like I don't
07:09 - know x equals four and I'd type X it
07:12 - just works like a basic Python console
07:14 - which is really useful you don't have to
07:16 - leave this if you just want to test out
07:17 - what a certain command in Python is
07:19 - gonna do without actually running the
07:21 - whole program and going through all of
07:23 - that now this has really just been some
07:25 - of the basics of pycharm if you'd like
07:28 - me to do a full tutorial going through a
07:29 - lot of the different things that
07:30 - high-time can do then i'm more than
07:33 - happy to do that but i need you guys to
07:34 - let me know that in the comments down
07:36 - below anyways i highly recommend you
07:38 - guys download install pycharm the only
07:40 - downfall to it is it uses a bit more
07:42 - memory than ideally that being said it
07:44 - still doesn't use that much I think for
07:46 - me it uses maybe like seven hundred
07:48 - eight hundred megabytes of RAM which is
07:49 - not that much but it's a lot more than
07:52 - ideal he does anyways that has been it
07:54 - for this video go download PyCharm in
07:57 - the link below this will definitely save
07:59 - you a lot of time when programming and
08:01 - if you guys enjoyed the video please
08:02 - make sure you leave a like and subscribe
08:04 - and I will see you again in another one
