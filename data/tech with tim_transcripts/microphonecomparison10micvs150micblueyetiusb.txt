00:00 - hey guys and welcome back generally you
00:02 - do video so in today's video I'm doing a
00:05 - quick mic comparison
00:06 - so pretty much I have this mic that I'm
00:09 - using right now which is my blue Yeti
00:10 - USB microphone I just recently got it I
00:14 - actually got it on January 21st I
00:16 - believe yeah let's go here to the Amazon
00:19 - page yeah January 21st cost me 140
00:22 - Canadian dollars and I'm really liking
00:25 - the sound quality of it so for ourself
00:27 - to tweak with some of the settings but
00:29 - right now I'm really liking it obviously
00:30 - it's a huge upgrade from from the some
00:33 - of the headset mics I've been using
00:34 - before and I just want to show you guys
00:36 - how much better this mic really is so an
00:39 - easy way that you guys can see how much
00:41 - better if this mic is is if you go and
00:43 - watch some of my older videos you'll
00:45 - hear the headset mic and then you can
00:48 - see the difference between the audio
00:49 - quality just from this video and those
00:51 - ones as well so now the other mic I'm
00:53 - gonna be comparing is just this basic
00:55 - headset mic so pretty much I have this
00:57 - Corsair headset I really like it as a
01:00 - headset great sound quality from it but
01:02 - the mic itself sucks so everyone that
01:05 - I've been like talking to on discord and
01:07 - stuff and just even recording with this
01:09 - mic you can hear it's really quiet and
01:11 - it just really sucks as a mic so that's
01:14 - why I'm saying it's probably been a
01:16 - ten-dollar mic and equivalent to that
01:18 - maybe I don't know you guys can tell me
01:20 - in the comments below how much you think
01:21 - this might cost but really that's not
01:23 - the reason I bought this I just bought
01:24 - it for the headset and obviously I'm
01:26 - pleased with how the headset is but the
01:28 - microphone really sucks so you guys can
01:29 - hear the difference between that in this
01:31 - video now what I'm pretty much gonna do
01:33 - is I'm just gonna open up audacity so I
01:35 - have it open down here and I'm just
01:37 - gonna do a few recordings using each mic
01:39 - so I'll have a sentence I'm gonna say I
01:41 - don't know for example I'll say my name
01:43 - is Tim on my blue Yeti mic and then on
01:46 - the headset mic I'll do the same and
01:48 - I'll play them beside each other so you
01:49 - guys can hear the difference in sound
01:51 - quality so keep watching and looking
01:52 - into the comparison this is a test
01:54 - recording on the blue Yeti USB
01:56 - microphone this is a test recording on
01:59 - the corsair RGB wireless headset
02:02 - microphone as you can probably tell the
02:04 - blue yeti microphone sounds much louder
02:07 - and is much clearer as you can probably
02:10 - tell the blue yeti microphone sound
02:12 - much louder Andes much clearer you may
02:15 - notice some background noise while
02:17 - listening to the blue Yeti microphone
02:19 - this is because this microphone is much
02:22 - more sensitive and is sitting on my
02:24 - table right now
02:25 - therefore it is picking up all of the
02:27 - sounds around it
02:28 - unlike the headset microphone this can
02:31 - be considered a good thing or a bad
02:33 - thing this headset microphone sits right
02:36 - up near my nose and near my mouth
02:38 - therefore it does not pick up the
02:40 - background sound as well it's a much
02:42 - less sensitive microphone and we can
02:45 - tell that just by the clarity of it as
02:46 - well because of the position of the
02:49 - microphone you may often hear me
02:51 - breathing that is because the filter on
02:54 - it is not very good and all of the air
02:56 - from my nose when I'm lightly breathing
02:58 - passes through like so I am currently
03:01 - using a pop filter on my blue Yeti
03:03 - microphone this pop filter cost $13 and
03:07 - it prevents you hearing the sound of my
03:09 - breathing and from hearing large pops
03:11 - when I say peas or bees alright so I
03:16 - hope that helped you guys understand the
03:18 - difference between the two microphones
03:20 - clearly the blue yeti microphone does
03:22 - sound better and it does sound clearer
03:24 - now I do want to note that although this
03:27 - does sound a lot better there are a lot
03:28 - of ways that I can make it sound a lot
03:30 - more clear and I can remove some of the
03:32 - background noise because if you noticed
03:34 - on this microphone it's super sensitive
03:37 - I have to gain all the way down right
03:39 - now and yet it's still picking up some
03:41 - of the vibrations and some of the sounds
03:42 - just from like my fans spinning in my
03:45 - computer so once I have my shockmount
03:47 - for that in the desk mount it's gonna
03:49 - sound a lot better and a lot more crisp
03:51 - but obviously even without that and
03:54 - minimal tuning you can hear how much
03:56 - better it sounds than the headset
03:57 - microphone now the main thing with the
03:59 - headset microphone is I'm not I'm trying
04:02 - to put it down or say it's a horrible
04:03 - microphone because really you get what
04:05 - you pay for right if you're paying for a
04:06 - headset you're not paying for an amazing
04:08 - microphone and it does do its job you
04:10 - can understand what I'm saying it all
04:13 - makes sense it is somewhat clear
04:15 - although it is very quiet and that's the
04:17 - biggest thing I found with this
04:18 - microphone so I don't really care how
04:19 - much it sounds if I'm just trying to
04:21 - chat with friends or just game but it's
04:23 - so quiet that the people on discord I'm
04:25 - talking to half
04:26 - turn me up all the way and I have to try
04:28 - to boost my mic all the way up and if
04:30 - you take off the little pop filter that
04:32 - comes with it just slides on top of the
04:34 - microphone then it's so loud and
04:37 - whenever you breathe because you can't
04:38 - really move the mic further away from
04:39 - your mouth they can hear it and it's
04:41 - really irritating and especially if you
04:43 - have your side tone on and on your mic
04:45 - which means that you can hear yourself
04:46 - speaking it's really irritating for that
04:48 - so anyways if you guys have any
04:50 - questions or anything you want to ask me
04:51 - down below about the two microphones or
04:53 - just in general leave a comment as I do

04:57 - are left in the comment section and if
