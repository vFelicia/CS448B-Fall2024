00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - so recently we've seen a huge amount of
00:10 - hype in the cryptocurrency space
00:12 - especially with nfts projects like
00:15 - crypto punks board api club sandbox and
00:18 - tons of others are becoming very popular
00:20 - and we're seeing nft sell in auctions
00:22 - for millions of dollars worth of
00:24 - ethereum so what are nfts and how do
00:27 - they work well nfts are designed to be
00:29 - treated as digital assets and or
00:31 - collector items that have some value or
00:33 - provide some privileges or rights to
00:35 - their owners owning nfts may give you
00:37 - access to attend an event it may give
00:39 - you the right to a piece of real estate
00:41 - or it might just be something you decide
00:42 - to use to launder money like traditional
00:45 - art anyways the reality is that the use
00:47 - cases of nfts are just starting to be
00:49 - discovered and it's likely that they're
00:50 - not going anywhere so now let me dive
00:53 - into how nfts hosted on ethereum
00:55 - actually work well first of all an nft
00:58 - is simply a non-fungible token this
01:00 - essentially means that every nft is
01:02 - unique in some way and it's not
01:04 - interchangeable with other nfts of the
01:06 - same type so this is in contrast to a
01:09 - fungible token which is identical to all
01:11 - other tokens meaning each token has the
01:13 - same value and the same properties now
01:16 - the way nfts are created is from a smart
01:18 - contract that is hosted on ethereum a
01:21 - smart contract is simply a piece of code
01:23 - that's running on the blockchain and if
01:25 - this contract adheres to a certain
01:26 - protocol then it becomes an nft contract
01:29 - allowing it to distribute and create new
01:31 - nfts now this protocol is known as the
01:34 - er 721 protocol and it defines the
01:37 - functions that a smart contract must
01:39 - implement to represent an nft now just
01:41 - like the erc 721 protocol there's also
01:44 - an erc20 protocol and this is used for
01:46 - your fungible tokens so any token that
01:49 - you might buy that's hosted on ethereum
01:50 - is likely going to adhere to the erc20
01:53 - protocol if you're buying an nft it's
01:55 - likely going to be the erc 721 so
01:57 - continuing erc 721 contracts are
02:00 - responsible for creating and allocating
02:03 - nfts and the way they do this is they
02:05 - associate specific ethereum accounts so
02:07 - your ethereum walled address with the
02:09 - unique ids of nfts that are created now
02:12 - every nft has a unique id and in simple
02:14 - terms if your address is linked with
02:16 - that id in the code of that smart
02:18 - contract then you own the nft now let me
02:21 - go on to the computer and i'll start
02:22 - showing you all of this in action and
02:24 - actually exploring the blockchain all
02:26 - right so in front of me i have a random
02:27 - nft that is hosted on openc for auction
02:31 - we can see right now it's listed for
02:32 - about a quarter of a million us dollars
02:34 - and this is the
02:36 - 7248th nft from the board ape yacht club
02:39 - collection this is what the graphic
02:41 - looks like for the nft i don't really
02:43 - care about any of that what i want to do
02:44 - is show you this on the blockchain so
02:46 - from openc what i can do is just go to
02:48 - the most recent transfer of this nft
02:50 - it's saying that some account send the
02:52 - nft to the current owner which is board
02:54 - dk so i'm going to click on this here
02:56 - and what i'm looking for is the actual
02:58 - nft token itself so i can see the
03:00 - transaction action right here which is
03:02 - saying there was a transfer of the board
03:03 - ape yacht club token from this address
03:06 - to this address and this is one token
03:08 - with the id of 7248.
03:11 - so i'm just going to click directly on
03:12 - this id here and it's going to show me
03:14 - this token on the blockchain okay so we
03:17 - have the token id 7248
03:19 - we have all of the transfers that have
03:21 - occurred and this first transfer here
03:22 - would have actually been the nft being
03:24 - created and then sent to a specific
03:26 - account or having a specific account
03:28 - owned whatever now what i want to look
03:30 - at is the contract the contract is
03:32 - actually what represents this nft and
03:34 - allows us to transfer it and is why this
03:36 - nft exists so if i click on this
03:38 - contract right here
03:40 - we can see this is the board ape yacht
03:42 - club contract right this is the official
03:43 - contract we can view all of the stuff
03:45 - that's happened in this contract so the
03:48 - reason why there's going to be so much
03:49 - uh or so many transactions here sorry is
03:51 - because every single time we want to
03:53 - transfer an nft from one person to
03:55 - another we need to interact with the
03:57 - smart contract that created that nft
04:00 - because the smart contract defines who
04:02 - owns what nft and so we need to call a
04:04 - dot transfer method or something on the
04:06 - contracts that we change the ownership
04:08 - of the nft from one person to another
04:10 - it's a little bit more complicated than
04:12 - that but that's the basics anyways i can
04:14 - click on the contract tab here and you
04:16 - can see that we can view all of the data
04:18 - of the contract and actually read the
04:20 - code itself now this contract is quite
04:22 - long it's about 1800 lines but if i
04:24 - scroll all the way down here
04:26 - we should be able to actually read the
04:28 - contract that represents our uh our
04:30 - board ape yacht club so let's go down
04:32 - here let's continue
04:34 - and we should see a contract right here
04:37 - okay so contract board api club is an er
04:40 - 721 coin notice that let me zoom in a
04:43 - bit here so we can read this and then
04:44 - what we can do is actually view all of
04:46 - the different functions and properties
04:48 - of the contract so this is completely
04:49 - transparent we can see all this so the
04:52 - starting price of an ape i guess is 0.08
04:54 - f we have the max a purchase so i guess
04:57 - only one person can have up to 20 apes
04:59 - we have the maximum number of apes and a
05:01 - bunch of other stuff we then have a
05:03 - constructor this will be called when the
05:05 - contract is actually deployed you don't
05:07 - have to worry about all the code but the
05:08 - point is that we can go in here and we
05:10 - can read this and we can start looking
05:12 - at actually how apes are created and
05:14 - what's going on directly in the contract
05:16 - so when i go here notice we have
05:17 - function mint ape this takes in the
05:19 - number of tokens and what it's going to
05:21 - do is require a bunch of things are true
05:23 - and then what it will do is actually
05:24 - create a new ape for us and it will
05:27 - associate that ape with whoever actually
05:29 - called this smart contract now i'm sure
05:31 - this is very confusing to a lot of you
05:33 - if you haven't looked at blockchain but
05:34 - the whole concept here is that we can
05:36 - look directly at the contract and we can
05:38 - kind of see how this works how apes were
05:41 - created and everything that's going on
05:42 - now one thing we can also do is we can
05:44 - read data directly from the contract so
05:46 - notice we have all of these i guess
05:48 - properties or functions that we can call
05:50 - and if i do something like go to the
05:52 - owner of i can put in my 7248
05:56 - that's the id of the token i'm talking
05:58 - about and it's going to tell me the
05:59 - address of the person that owns it so
06:01 - now if i click on this address here i
06:03 - can go and i can view their inventory
06:05 - and i can look for it looks like they
06:06 - have a lot of stuff their board ape
06:08 - yacht club so now down here i'm viewing
06:10 - the address of the person who owns this
06:13 - 7248 board ap yacht club token what i
06:16 - can do is click on inventory and i can
06:18 - see all of the tokens that they own so
06:20 - right i can go here and then i can go
06:21 - back and view 7248.
06:25 - anyways the point of me showing all of
06:26 - this to you is that you can view
06:28 - everything on the blockchain completely
06:29 - transparently and what we just did is go
06:31 - to openc we viewed that we had a coin on
06:34 - openc that was for auction in this case
06:36 - it's an nft right this was the
06:38 - 7248 board api club token we then went
06:42 - and viewed the most recent transaction
06:43 - with it clicked into that token viewed
06:45 - the contract that actually created that
06:47 - token and then we interacted with the
06:49 - contract saw who actually owned the
06:51 - token then went and viewed their
06:53 - inventory and saw that they had another
06:55 - token as well alright so i'm now back on
06:57 - openc and we are almost finished the
06:59 - last thing i want to show you is how we
07:00 - actually deal with the images of the
07:02 - nfts or the music or the background or
07:04 - whatever is making up the nft
07:06 - anyways we have number 7248
07:10 - we have obviously metadata associated
07:11 - with this now to view the metadata you
07:13 - can scroll down if you're on and you can
07:15 - click on metadata now notice that we can
07:17 - actually view all of this data it's not
07:19 - hidden it's not private we can see it
07:21 - all and we can see where the image is
07:22 - hosted the attributes and all of this
07:24 - stuff now this data the metadata of the
07:26 - nft is going to be hosted off of the
07:28 - blockchain in some location and the way
07:31 - that we're going to associate an nft
07:33 - with its metadata is we're actually
07:34 - going to add something to the smart
07:36 - contract that links the unique id of our
07:39 - nft with some url of where the metadata
07:42 - is stored now the reason why this data
07:44 - will be secure is because we're going to
07:45 - store a hash of this data on the
07:47 - blockchain which means that if we ever
07:49 - modify this data right here that
07:51 - represents that nft the blockchain will
07:54 - know and will there'll be some problems
07:55 - we actually won't even be able to modify
07:58 - anyways i hope that makes a little bit
07:59 - of sense but i'm just trying to show you
08:00 - that the data of our nft is literally in
08:03 - a json file like this it's stored
08:05 - somewhere on the internet that anyone
08:07 - can access and that you can go and view
08:10 - and the reason we can't modify it is
08:11 - because we store a hash of this on the
08:13 - blockchain we're in the spark contract
08:15 - and so we know if someone tampers with
08:17 - that data anyways with that said i am
08:19 - going to end the video here i hope this
08:21 - gave you some insight into nfts if you
08:23 - guys are interested in learning more
08:25 - about cryptocurrency technology then
08:27 - definitely subscribe to this channel
08:28 - because we're going to have all sorts of
08:29 - tutorials in the future last thing if
08:32 - you are looking to become a programmer
08:33 - or become a software engineer check out
08:35 - my course programming expert dot io
