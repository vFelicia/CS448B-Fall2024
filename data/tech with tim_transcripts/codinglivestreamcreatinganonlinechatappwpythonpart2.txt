00:02 - all right I believe we are live now I'm
00:06 - just gonna wait one second to make sure
00:08 - everything's working here oh I forgot to
00:09 - get the music going okay we got to get
00:11 - the music going so we're gonna be one
00:12 - second here guys
00:14 - but essentially what I'm we doing this
00:15 - stream while I kind of just look to set
00:17 - things up here quickly is we are going
00:20 - to be continuing from the last one
00:22 - although I won't lie I've done a
00:23 - significant amount of work on this
00:25 - project off camera I had a lot of time
00:27 - yesterday coming in between classes on
00:29 - my laptop or I couldn't stream but I
00:30 - want to work on it so I'll be you
00:32 - starting off refreshing you guys with
00:33 - what I've got here I've actually got
00:35 - this chat working and I've kind of
00:36 - changed frameworks a little bit so it'll
00:38 - be a bit of a refresher on what we've
00:40 - done but if you guys didn't catch the
00:41 - lot the last livestream and you want to
00:43 - see kind of from the very beginning then
00:45 - there is the last upload on my channel
00:47 - that you guys can check out give me one
00:49 - second I'm just going to try to get this
00:51 - music working because this is gonna be
00:52 - painful for about an hour
00:54 - streaming if we don't have that and
00:55 - that's also what I wanted to say we are
00:57 - probably gonna be streaming for close to
00:58 - an hour today I don't wanna go for too
01:00 - long I actually have a job interview
01:02 - later today so I figured I'd hop on work
01:05 - on the project a little bit first and
01:06 - then go from there
01:08 - alright so let's get music again you
01:11 - guys gotta let me know if this music is
01:13 - too loud or too quiet I never really can
01:15 - tell based on my broadcasting software
01:17 - so let's see this right Wow $20 from mr.
01:25 - genius appreciate the super chat man you
01:27 - didn't want to ask any questions let's
01:29 - see what the chat saying here hello how
01:30 - are you doing man hello greetings from
01:32 - Greece this is so true is the front end
01:35 - just flossing they're using a framework
01:37 - you have to tell us a result of the
01:39 - interview for sure I'll let you guys
01:41 - know 125 concurrent viewers appreciate
01:43 - you guys hopping in here
01:44 - hello Python rich JavaScript alright so
01:47 - let's get started and kind of discuss
01:48 - what I've done I'll start with a little
01:50 - bit of a demo and then we'll kind of
01:51 - talk about all the backend work that
01:52 - went into and the changes that we did
01:54 - here so you guys don't remember from
01:56 - last time I'll log out here what I was
01:58 - trying to do was essentially have it so
02:01 - that I had a separate server that
02:03 - handled all messaging communication and
02:05 - I had data from this kind of front-end
02:07 - server here being sent to that server
02:09 - and then it handled the message
02:10 - communication sent out it back and I was
02:12 - kind of working but
02:13 - it was pretty glitchy like it was
02:15 - there's a lot of bugs and stuff so I
02:17 - actually changed framers completely and
02:19 - now I'm using flask socket IO which I
02:21 - didn't even know existed but apparently
02:23 - is built into flask so I'll show you
02:25 - guys a little bit here
02:26 - so essentially socket IO dot on event
02:28 - and you can handle custom events right
02:30 - from flask and it does all the
02:32 - connection disconnection for you so you
02:34 - don't have to worry about actually
02:36 - creating the sockets you just have to
02:37 - kind of understand a bit about the
02:39 - communication protocol which is what
02:41 - I've been doing so let's do a demo so
02:44 - you can see I've changed a little bit
02:45 - this page I want to make look a little
02:46 - bit nicer in terms of like signing in
02:48 - creating an account or whatever that's
02:50 - not creating account it's just like
02:51 - picking a name but let's go with test as
02:54 - our name here and when we go we can see
02:56 - I've actually set up a database as well
02:58 - that stores all the previous messages
03:00 - and the time in which they were sent I'm
03:02 - having a slight bug with that which
03:03 - we'll talk about later but this is just
03:05 - a local SQLite three database and now
03:08 - actually I'm on my phone and I'm on the
03:10 - website on my phone because I have this
03:12 - running on my local IP address which you
03:14 - guys can see 192.168.0.1 don't try to
03:18 - connect to it because it won't work
03:19 - unless you're on my network but on my
03:21 - phone I have the website open so I'm
03:23 - just gonna send a message I'm gonna say
03:24 - hello my name is Tim going to click send
03:28 - and you can see that that message
03:30 - actually pops up on here now notice too
03:32 - when I send a message from here I said
03:34 - hello my name it was test oh wow we get
03:40 - a gray bubble instead of this lighter
03:42 - gray level so it actually separates the
03:44 - different people you can see their names
03:45 - are on the right side our name is on the
03:47 - left side and it changes the date format
03:49 - as well based on who's sending the
03:51 - message so pretty interesting let's see
03:53 - what the guys are saying in the chat
03:54 - here you have a Spotify playlist I do
03:56 - not don't your eyes get tired when you
03:58 - code for too much time yeah definitely
04:00 - they do greetings from Bangladesh hello
04:02 - why don't use Django I've been asked
04:04 - that question about a million times
04:06 - louder please it's perfect what would
04:08 - turn up one anything else you guys are
04:12 - saying here no no 173 K subs with 173
04:16 - views that's funny yeah but only 53
04:19 - likes if you guys are here watching
04:20 - right now go please like the stream help
04:22 - significantly
04:24 - hello from India hi from India lots of
04:26 - Indians lo guys okay so let's start
04:30 - getting digging into the code I'll show
04:31 - you guys kind of what I've done and then
04:32 - I'm gonna start working on fixing a few
04:34 - bugs again it's just a shorter stream
04:36 - today I just wanted to hop on I figured
04:37 - I have to do this I might as well stream
04:39 - it anyways so yeah okay so let's look at
04:42 - kind of our architecture of this program
04:44 - now so this is the old message server I
04:46 - split it up into this server file so
04:48 - this is what I was trying to do before
04:49 - is have this client communication all
04:51 - running from this server with like
04:53 - global variables and person objects and
04:56 - it was working but it was just kind of
04:57 - glitchy and then the client was here so
04:59 - you could connect and send messages and
05:01 - I had memory locks and all this
05:02 - complicated stuff so I kind of scrapped
05:04 - that I still kept it just in case but
05:06 - I'm not gonna be using it so instead
05:09 - everything is now inside this website
05:11 - folder so what I have is this main
05:13 - application which is almost the entry
05:15 - point I'll talk about that in a second
05:16 - so the way this works is we import flask
05:19 - i/o we import some things from
05:21 - application which I'll show in a second
05:23 - we create an app using a factory which
05:26 - I'll show you and then we create a
05:27 - socket and then all I have in here is
05:29 - literally just the communication
05:30 - functions for events because I've split
05:32 - everything up into blueprints actually
05:34 - with flask and I'll show you how that
05:36 - works
05:36 - so let's go actually inside application
05:39 - to this init top PI file where things
05:42 - kind of start so this is the create app
05:44 - function you can see here I call create
05:48 - app after importing it from application
05:50 - because this is a package and what ends
05:52 - up happening if I go to or is it an it
05:56 - here is this creates a new flask
05:58 - application based on my environment
06:00 - variables which are in here and then
06:02 - what it does is it imports all the
06:04 - necessary modules and imports a filter
06:06 - which I use in the Jenga templating
06:08 - engine and the database registers the
06:10 - blueprint for the views folder which is
06:12 - here that handles all the routes and
06:14 - then it actually registers a context
06:17 - processor which is used to do a slice
06:19 - operation inside of templates for flask
06:23 - I know this is complicated but it's kind
06:25 - of the easiest way to explain it then it
06:27 - returns this application from the width
06:30 - from the return app so when it returns
06:32 - that that gives us a working application
06:34 - in main so then we can simply socket dot
06:37 - run that app and then run it with
06:39 - whatever the configuration server
06:40 - variable is in our env file now database
06:43 - this just works doesn't sqlite3 database
06:45 - local database is called messages dot DB
06:48 - forgot I don't need to see duck CDW
06:50 - there um and yeah what this does is just
06:53 - you know makes a table closes the
06:55 - connection and creates the table just
06:56 - some basic queries with SQL get all
07:00 - messages we run a query and then we
07:02 - actually have a limit on the query
07:03 - because sometimes you don't want to get
07:05 - unlimited amount of messages from the
07:06 - database you just want say 100 or you
07:08 - just want the most recent 50 or whatever
07:11 - so this queries all of them and then
07:12 - we'll take the most recent messages by
07:15 - doing this and then it returns out in
07:18 - JSON format like that
07:20 - alright so save message what this does
07:23 - is just insert into that table the save
07:25 - message so we're just using date/time
07:27 - objects and then time done now let's see
07:30 - what you guys are saying here how did
07:32 - you connect your PC to your IP address
07:35 - I can't all you do is just run the flask
07:37 - app on your local IP address rather than
07:40 - localhost it's not very hard can I ask
07:43 - why you use regular sockets I'm not
07:46 - using regular sockets I'm using flask IO
07:47 - sockets that's what I was trying to
07:49 - explain I'm also using pycharm okay so
07:51 - this is the views file I'm just gonna go
07:53 - through all of it because I know you
07:54 - guys if you were here in the last one
07:55 - probably want to know what changed so
07:57 - the way that this one works is similar
07:59 - to before essentially I should okay even
08:01 - need Lions global yeah I don't need this
08:06 - oops so let's start cleaning up some
08:09 - code that's also what I'm gonna be doing
08:10 - a bit today is just cleaning some things
08:11 - up making it look a little bit nicer so
08:13 - we can get rid of that now cuz we didn't
08:15 - even need that so I just start by
08:17 - registering this blueprint in view and
08:19 - then I have all my routes so I my login
08:21 - method which has potent guest requests I
08:23 - also implemented this message flashing
08:26 - which you guys saw in the HTML I have
08:28 - log outs I have a home page I have get
08:30 - name which is the used for fetch request
08:32 - from the jQuery get messages which is
08:35 - used for fetch request from the jQuery
08:37 - as well and then remove seconds which
08:38 - just removes the seconds off a date/time
08:40 - string for me filters this is just a
08:43 - slice filter this is a custom I just
08:45 - found this online I just it just does
08:47 - slice for you it so you can use it in
08:49 - Django templates
08:50 - config' these are just grabbing the
08:52 - config variables from the env file and
08:55 - then if we go into static or so into
08:59 - index EAS you can see I've implemented a
09:01 - few async functions here so I have this
09:04 - one up here this essentially just
09:05 - resizes the window that's a chat window
09:08 - to be 90% of the site or 80% of the size
09:11 - of the actual full window this one is
09:14 - just a scrolling implementations of too
09:16 - many messages pop and it'll
09:17 - automatically scroll at the bottom I
09:19 - have a function to load the name to load
09:22 - all the messages I have a function that
09:23 - gets the date now in the proper string
09:26 - format I have the socket connection
09:29 - which is needed for socket IO connection
09:31 - and flask and then this is kind of
09:33 - handling all of the events and sending
09:35 - receiving messages and then we have an
09:39 - onload the onload displays all the old
09:41 - messages on the screen and then add
09:43 - message which simply adds it to the div
09:45 - on the screen so what are you guys
09:48 - seeing here are you storing messages
09:49 - somewhere directly sending it to the
09:50 - client I'm storing messages on in a
09:53 - database but I'm only storing them in a
09:54 - database after they've been sent to all
09:56 - clients that are connected what else you
09:59 - guys saying can these messages be
10:00 - end-to-end encrypted they could I don't
10:02 - encrypt them but I mean they could be
10:04 - can we go through GPT especially crap I
10:07 - don't know what that is encapsulate it
10:10 - will you end up code on github you're
10:12 - actually not really supposed to
10:13 - encapsulate flask applications at least
10:16 - the way that I'm doing them so it
10:18 - doesn't really make sense to put them in
10:19 - classes it just makes it actually more
10:21 - confusing I'm just gonna keep it
10:22 - functional for now we make a tutorial on
10:25 - this potentially will your code be up
10:26 - and github there's a link in the
10:28 - description for the code I still see a
10:29 - hundred 70 people in here and 112 likes
10:32 - which means some of you have not liked
10:33 - the stream yet so please go ahead and do
10:35 - that and yeah okay so let's type some
10:37 - more messages so I trying to show you
10:38 - some more features so if you go like
10:40 - like yes sir oh whoa I don't know why
10:43 - that happened of course we're gonna
10:46 - glitch right on stream when
10:49 - what the heck oh it's cuz I haven't I
10:52 - haven't pulled the thing yet let's see
10:54 - here
10:56 - rebase 5000 W I don't know what that
11:00 - currency is just started learning coding
11:02 - great content thank you for what you're
11:04 - doing love your channel I appreciate the
11:05 - super chat man rebase the current branch
11:08 - on top of incoming changers all files
11:11 - are up to date okay
11:12 - I don't know why that sent multiple
11:14 - times because that's literally never
11:16 - happened before but of course that's
11:18 - gonna happen to me now oh it's cuz okay
11:22 - so I think I'm working on an outdated
11:23 - version right now I'm just gonna get my
11:25 - laptop out and push more recent github
11:27 - changes so one second guys on that front
11:29 - so yeah yesterday I was working on this
11:38 - quite a bit on my laptop but I don't
11:40 - think I remembered to push the changes
11:42 - to github so let's do that now alright
11:48 - sorry that I am just boring you guys
11:50 - right now but this is how it's gonna be
11:52 - okay so get that dot ah yeah there was a
12:08 - lot of change down here that I hadn't
12:09 - pushed yet okay so I was wondering why
12:11 - it was like that so it's like I thought
12:12 - I fixed that so give me what's like I'm
12:14 - just gonna get clone this again once we
12:16 - get back onto this computer turn that
12:19 - off there we go
12:30 - all right yeah so I was trying to do a
12:33 - thing where it said like you left the
12:34 - server you joined the server but it
12:35 - wasn't really working so yeah that was
12:37 - kind of why this one had it and then
12:40 - like this new version doesn't that I'm
12:41 - going to show you anyways you'll see yes
12:43 - so inspect by the way whoever told me
12:45 - this where you can empty the cache by
12:47 - left-clicking on this is like a genius
12:49 - thank you so much that saved me a
12:51 - significant amount of time so let's I
12:53 - can actually be able to rebase because I
12:55 - already have changes in here that aren't
12:56 - committed so we're just gonna have to
12:58 - actually get the link again which means
13:01 - I have to go to github alright one
13:03 - second just need to clone this
13:12 - repository guys give me one second oh
13:15 - what's happened to my music Oh still
13:20 - here okay get stash yeah I know you guys
13:30 - are saying get stash but like I've tried
13:31 - to use it it just as like glitchy I just
13:33 - rather use this okay does this work
13:40 - chat web app alright oh no it's only
13:44 - Linux okay let's do that
13:47 - delete okay so now we should have the
13:52 - most recent version so I'll be able to
13:54 - show you guys that's a pycharm sorry
13:57 - about the delay I really thought that
13:59 - app did that just use links I would but
14:01 - my recording software does not work on
14:03 - Linux or it doesn't work but I just have
14:08 - like all these settings in Windows and I
14:10 - don't really care to import over right
14:11 - now um okay close that alright there's
14:17 - something else I wanted to do okay so
14:18 - this needs to be refreshed let's go
14:21 - inspect and then I wanted to remove
14:24 - something from views
14:28 - ah this one okay nice all right so let's
14:35 - run the web server think we should be
14:38 - okay here awesome yep that's what we're
14:39 - looking for let's just go here inspect
14:44 - why can't why is this inspection not
14:46 - working inspect okay well that's great
14:52 - okay there we go login all right so name
14:56 - let's go with Tim submit you're
15:00 - successfully logged in as Tim let's go
15:02 - test what's up my name is Tim and this
15:09 - it's just testing I want to add some
15:12 - more messages so you guys see I also
15:14 - need to add a thing so that it doesn't
15:16 - let you send a blank message so notice
15:17 - this it actually lets you scroll it
15:20 - Scrolls down automatically when a new
15:21 - message comes in so I'm gonna go on my
15:23 - phone again just clear the cache here
15:25 - and show you guys that someone 9 - lets
15:28 - go yeh sense you can see it
15:32 - automatically Scrolls down which i think
15:33 - is kind of cool and if you guys think of
15:35 - any other features you think I should
15:36 - add to this let me know but like for
15:38 - example I log out and I log back in as
15:40 - like Joey then it shows all the messages
15:43 - again but now my name changes so the
15:45 - only thing that's kind of conflicting is
15:46 - if floods like two people on the server
15:48 - that the same name then it gets a little
15:50 - bit like okay it just shows you the same
15:52 - thing
15:54 - so yeah that's like the only issue I
15:56 - don't really know how to fix that though
15:57 - because I mean I have to save all the
15:58 - names of the people and then check that
15:59 - you don't already have the same name
16:01 - which I don't really want to do right
16:02 - now but anyways okay let's hear you guys
16:04 - are saying Tim you brought it up man
16:07 - you're helping tons of people appreciate
16:09 - that
16:10 - if you press ctrl f5 that resets cache
16:12 - as well okay use the what's everyone
16:17 - saying okay I don't know sometimes you
16:22 - guys have conversations in here and I
16:23 - have no idea what you're talking to them
16:24 - alright so what I want to do now oh yes
16:28 - there is a glitch where sometimes these
16:31 - messages when they display from the
16:33 - database don't work properly like they
16:35 - display in the wrong order so let's log
16:38 - in as Billy
16:40 - and we'll see and I think it's fine
16:44 - right now but sometimes this sort
16:46 - doesn't work properly on these messages
16:48 - and it shows them to me and like a
16:49 - different order at least that's
16:51 - something I've noticed so I want to see
16:53 - if there's any way I could fix that I
16:54 - also want to see it you guys think
16:55 - there's any other features that should
16:56 - be added to this website I mean I'm kind
16:59 - of thinking that like I want something
17:00 - that looks a little bit nicer but I
17:01 - don't really know
17:02 - okay who's drunk okay if you guys are
17:05 - sending D then I'm just gonna be banning
17:08 - you in the chat so okay so I guess our
17:10 - first person is gonna be getting banned
17:11 - here um remove actually you can go in a
17:16 - timeout
17:17 - like that you can go in a timeout - who
17:22 - wants to be a moderator and ban everyone
17:24 - okay put user in timeouts let's see put
17:30 - user in timeouts ah there we go
17:34 - okay that's much better nice clean chat
17:37 - okay um so login logout chat I'm
17:40 - wondering like what else I could do I'm
17:43 - almost thinking like do chat history
17:46 - like maybe I'll add a page right now
17:47 - that says chat history and what it will
17:49 - do is you like when you logged in as a
17:51 - certain specific name it'll show you all
17:53 - the messages in your chat history so
17:55 - actually maybe let's let's go and
17:56 - implement that that doesn't seem like
17:57 - it's gonna take too long and that could
17:58 - be some new work to be doing on this
18:00 - stream because this was coming in just
18:01 - be like a bug fixing stream but that's
18:04 - fine um what's the problem about the
18:06 - name on the site the problem is just
18:07 - that's not secure because it's on my
18:08 - local IP address are using flask on the
18:11 - back and looks like material thing yeah
18:13 - I'm using flask on the back end okay so
18:15 - let's make a new view actually for that
18:18 - and we're gonna meet need a new database
18:20 - method that will query by name so I'm
18:23 - actually gonna say define get messages
18:27 - by name self name alright so returns
18:37 - it's gets wise where's my capital gets a
18:44 - list of messages by username I suppose
18:49 - we'll have a limit on this as well -
18:51 - just in case those message
18:53 - in case there's too many so we'll set
18:56 - the limit at 100 by default but they can
18:57 - change that if they want say / am not
19:00 - SAS string return actually this is gonna
19:02 - be a list of dicks so what I'm gonna do
19:06 - here is Lily just copy this query and
19:10 - this results yep and we'll do that here
19:12 - okay so we're gonna say query F select
19:16 - from where name equals question mark and
19:23 - I think what I have to do here is put
19:26 - inside of these parentheses B name which
19:29 - is that although I'm just gonna look it
19:31 - up because I kind of forget how I query
19:34 - like that so I'm just gonna say sqlite3
19:38 - query by column python okay cuz I think
19:45 - there's something I got to do with like
19:46 - a question mark for the query select
19:48 - star where ya priority okay so it's in
19:51 - execute comma okay sweet so I was right
19:54 - okay so now we'll just say for our and
19:59 - results and someone's gonna tell me how
20:02 - to fix the stem PyCharm Auto completing
20:05 - like it just ruins my time trying type
20:08 - here so let's take this let's literally
20:10 - take the same thing so it results and
20:15 - then results equals I understand this a
20:22 - little bit redundant I'm almost thinking
20:24 - there's a better way to do this although
20:27 - this is reversing yeah cuz it's gonna do
20:29 - the same thing okay actually no I'm just
20:32 - gonna make it get all messages I'm gonna
20:34 - make it one function we could say get
20:37 - messages my name is one sure but it'll
20:38 - just end up calling this interior
20:40 - function
20:41 - hmm cuz I don't want to rewrite this if
20:44 - I don't have to so let's do this
20:46 - so query 1 SF select from where name
21:00 - equals question mark okay so we'll just
21:03 - say limit name equals blanks actually
21:11 - the name equals none and I will say if
21:12 - not none because we'll just do the same
21:14 - thing okay so let's do this we'll say if
21:18 - not name then query this Alice query
21:30 - equals select from so the only thing is
21:32 - I don't want it to be like you have to
21:33 - do a limit and you have to do a name so
21:35 - I'll make another function that will
21:36 - call this properly in here let's do that
21:39 - name content time reverse limit yep that
21:41 - seems to work for me get Beth's messages
21:43 - by name okay so what this will do is
21:45 - simply just call this so it'll say self
21:48 - get all messages return that with the
21:53 - limit comma name and then we should
21:57 - actually be good on that not idea so
21:59 - what is this saying here what's the
22:00 - issue okay let's see what you guys are
22:02 - saying the chat what's your favorite IDE
22:04 - IDE like PyCharm or vs code maybe hello
22:07 - Tim what do you saying find out Tim's
22:12 - actually getting a job opportunity for
22:13 - disk or anything leading online chat
22:15 - company that's not actually true I'll
22:18 - tell you guys later on but I'm leaving
22:20 - it a secret for now until I go through
22:22 - the interviews okay so come on still
22:25 - that's fine
22:27 - okay so get all messages get messages by
22:31 - name I think that should work
22:34 - where name equals question mark ah
22:36 - that's what I need yes
22:40 - so that query nun named comma okay so
22:47 - now what I'm gonna do is make a new
22:48 - route so say that's you route slosh
22:56 - history maybe yeah so this way you could
23:00 - see the history of any user so this
23:01 - obviously is not meant to be like a
23:02 - secured chat site it's just meant to
23:04 - like kind of show the fact and the
23:06 - communication like more just to show off
23:09 - to be honest than anything so define
23:11 - history I guess we'll have a refresh on
23:12 - the history page so what history will
23:14 - need to do is render a template and it
23:17 - will need to send to that template all
23:18 - of the data both the messages umm-hmm
23:22 - see a better way to do this so get
23:25 - messages okay remove seconds I will need
23:30 - to do that so now I'm thinking I want a
23:35 - utility function just to save me but
23:37 - it's I'm here define remove seconds from
23:42 - messages okay let's say this is promise
23:48 - geez okay
23:51 - removes the seconds from all messages to
23:57 - be less return list so what this will do
24:03 - is say messages message message message
24:05 - yeah okay
24:09 - souls that return messages this now can
24:17 - just be messages equals remove message
24:23 - of seconds your messages MSG's and then
24:26 - return messages JSON five masters okay
24:30 - nice
24:30 - so now we'll make our other routes here
24:32 - so that's you dodge route are already
24:38 - which already make one at the top I did
24:41 - so actually we'll move this to the
24:42 - bottom so I feel like it makes sense to
24:44 - be there okay so here define history at
24:50 - few dot routes will say define hiss
24:55 - sorry this will need a name for sure and
25:00 - we'll call literally the exact same
25:02 - thing here
25:03 - well I should say get underscore history
25:06 - and get underscore history here just on
25:10 - the fly messages except DB duck gets
25:12 - messages by name and then we won't pass
25:17 - the message limit we'll just pass the
25:19 - name which means we'll get a hundred
25:21 - messages at most and then remove setting
25:25 - for messages return JSON five looks good
25:28 - to me okay so this is actually gonna be
25:30 - the route yeah so just say to turn
25:35 - Graham name string return all messages
25:41 - by name of user okay and then we'll add
25:49 - another route here at few routes history
25:58 - like that define history okay this will
26:06 - need a name for sure so in here I'm just
26:10 - I'm kind of thinking like if you go to
26:12 - the slash history page maybe what we'll
26:13 - do is just yeah cuz they could just
26:17 - refresh the page if they wanted to see
26:18 - the new history is just actually call
26:20 - this so get so will get the history by
26:23 - calling this function I think I can call
26:26 - this even if it's not returning yeah cuz
26:29 - it should just give me JSON response and
26:30 - messages then I could pass that JSON
26:32 - response and messages through to a
26:35 - template and the template could just
26:36 - display them in kind of like a chat
26:37 - window yeah so let's try that for now so
26:40 - that means we'll make it need to make a
26:42 - new template so let's go new HTML file
26:47 - this Tory dot HTML okay add we don't
26:54 - need that let's go to index and just
26:57 - copy some of this stuff okay message
27:04 - history and then say percent percent
27:12 - o'clock content I'm trying to debate how
27:15 - I want to display this if I want to put
27:17 - it in like a table I want to like just
27:20 - show them in like a list like I don't
27:22 - really know see what you guys are saying
27:25 - have you enabled the font no I don't
27:28 - know what that is
27:29 - um you guys chatting about I des
27:32 - another reminder if you guys are in the
27:34 - chat right now please do go and like it
27:37 - doesn't take very long I mean I'm gonna
27:38 - be streaming for like an hour I feel
27:40 - like that's like a word the trade off
27:42 - you guys like the chat and I stream for
27:44 - you so anyways okay anything else we
27:47 - need to clean up your message limit
27:49 - okay so history name okay so let's say
27:55 - messages let's say JSON message is
28:00 - equals get
28:03 - messages I think I can call that um
28:06 - forget history but I don't know if it I
28:10 - don't even let me call that just because
28:11 - it has a decorator of it so you say get
28:13 - history and we'll give it the name of
28:16 - session ass that's what I need to do
28:20 - session name key so if not name key if
28:27 - you say if name P no it's in session
28:31 - then return a redirect of the URL for
28:36 - home and I actually want to flash on the
28:40 - home page please login it's not even
28:46 - home sorry this should actually been
28:47 - logging and it should actually be you
28:52 - don't log in so I'm actually gonna flash
28:54 - on that page please log in before
28:56 - viewing message history like that okay
29:04 - redirect otherwise we'll get the JSON
29:07 - messages and then we'll say return
29:10 - around your templates and this will be
29:13 - history HTML nice we just say data
29:19 - equals JSON message is or will actually
29:22 - say kiss Tory okay so that should be
29:28 - good for that let's go to the slash
29:30 - history page let's go blog content let's
29:32 - just do a for loop and less it out for
29:34 - now just to make sure that this is gonna
29:36 - work before you go too far so we'll
29:38 - start by just saying ya know for MSG in
29:44 - what I call this history yeah so this is
29:49 - JSON so let's start our and for I want
29:55 - to remember what it even has as the
29:56 - indexes here so let's go to database
30:00 - name message time come on display all
30:03 - that I've already done that in index
30:05 - quite a bit so I fit in that Jason let's
30:10 - see here documents where do I add
30:21 - messages I've had this in here somewhere
30:28 - then cévennes events add message here's
30:33 - where it is okay so up here we make divs
30:36 - if type of message does not equal
30:39 - undefined bar glow as a wiggle and bar
30:42 - content that's what I wanted okay so we
30:46 - actually just want the one that's dark
30:48 - right darker here okay
30:55 - so I need to put this in a specific div
30:58 - that's what I remember that makes us
31:01 - look like kind of nice and styled and
31:03 - like shows all the messages so let's go
31:05 - history we're gonna copy that in here
31:07 - for now we'll deal with this in a second
31:09 - and then what I want to do I should I
31:13 - can remove all these quotation marks I
31:15 - don't even know why we need that so I
31:25 - don't even think I need these plus signs
31:26 - actually okay then this should go inside
31:33 - a larger div that's okay no no help stop
31:44 - don't want you to do that oh it should
31:46 - be it's a div for message you're like
31:54 - that and then here instead of that would
31:57 - say msg the name okay msg message p
32:19 - what's wrong with this that looks fine
32:21 - okay so I think that should be okay I
32:23 - need to add something to this div I
32:25 - forget what it was in here div class not
32:30 - that one which is here it is okay
32:36 - class overflow I think I had something
32:40 - to do with that but this should be fine
32:42 - for now okay and I think that's alright
32:47 - see what you guys are saying please
32:49 - don't use var and J s letting const are
32:51 - much better about whatever it's fine
32:53 - front end with template block file div
32:56 - or something so what to use Python for
32:59 - Python handles the entire back end this
33:01 - is just like this is the front end stuff
33:02 - I'm doing right now I need to find where
33:06 - this window was here it was okay so
33:10 - let's inspect now the web server is down
33:18 - invalid syntax that's good I saved it at
33:21 - that point okay so we have history on
33:22 - HTML we have used out HTML get name get
33:27 - messages utilities there's something I
33:29 - need to add inside the base template
33:32 - which I believe is just another thing in
33:34 - the navbar exactly okay so another
33:37 - navbar I actually want to do this oh
33:42 - that's interesting
33:44 - chat okay so let's do this have our item
33:49 - link why can't i okay you know what
33:52 - that's fine slash history history okay
34:03 - it's around the web server okay let's go
34:07 - here no not that one
34:11 - I'm ever gonna be remember which one
34:13 - this is k empty cache whoa
34:18 - see so I don't want this I don't want
34:21 - this message Billy just left the server
34:23 - popping up so I'm gonna need to fix that
34:26 - unless it's literally like that I need
34:28 - to clear the history or something okay
34:30 - so history history missing one required
34:32 - potential arguments name
34:35 - why did my Siri just go off okay so we
34:37 - need to fix that so if you go to history
34:40 - so history doesn't actually need to take
34:42 - name and that's in views okay now there
34:53 - was something going on in my front end
34:55 - here that I need to fix
34:58 - so sending messages let's see here if
35:05 - connect equals true cuz I don't want
35:08 - what is the same response object is not
35:14 - iterable for message in history
35:22 - hmm okay ah wait response object history
35:30 - equals because I almost want to do it
35:32 - like this so I know this is literally
35:47 - gonna do the same thing but I think that
35:49 - should hopefully work let's see what you
35:53 - guys are saying is it offline installer'
35:55 - online it's not an installer it's just
35:57 - like a website you're coding website
36:02 - with Python yep so there's something
36:06 - going on though when it leaves that I
36:08 - don't want the index you can just
36:11 - connect ah that's why because I don't
36:16 - want it to say they left the server so
36:18 - we'll get rid of that for now and then
36:21 - here spawns object is not interval or
36:27 - message in history see it's not saying
36:30 - its response so why am I getting that
36:33 - though that shouldn't be the issue
36:44 - message in history I want to see what
36:49 - history is though so JSON message Eagles
36:51 - get history okay let's just print JSON
36:54 - message I think I have an idea why it's
36:56 - saying that but we'll have an idea here
36:59 - in a minute okay so we got an error here
37:04 - I response bytes 200 okay so that
37:10 - because it's returning JSON fly from get
37:12 - messages from get history you know so
37:15 - let's not JSON Phi okay fresh
37:25 - haha this in history tab so this is all
37:31 - the messages that were saved in the
37:32 - server with an okay so we're gonna have
37:36 - to delete those from here because we're
37:40 - not we're no longer going to save those
37:42 - kind of messages um get history remove
37:45 - seconds
37:47 - okay so face use history HTML class and
37:53 - this needs to be msg it's time okay so
38:02 - that should work
38:07 - no you need to use get body on JSON five
38:12 - all right I mean I think I'm fine using
38:15 - flask yes I am using flask okay let's go
38:21 - login actually history okay so when I
38:24 - click history oh it's because I'm logged
38:26 - in but I felt thought I cleared this
38:29 - okay so let's restart the web server
38:31 - actually so I don't know where I'm
38:36 - logged case of logout history please
38:39 - login for viewing message oh my good
38:41 - why's my Siri keep going off Jesus
38:43 - okay so I need to change something here
38:45 - quickly use where is flash here
39:00 - yeah when we go history history history
39:04 - okay
39:06 - history dot HTML flash zero all right
39:13 - okay so now we go in there and we start
39:16 - typing some messages so let's go Tim
39:19 - submit let's go test message okay
39:27 - another one
39:29 - Kevin login from my phone now and just
39:32 - clear the cache first and see if this
39:35 - works
39:35 - give me one second guys I really should
39:40 - just do this on another computer to be
39:41 - honest you know what yeah let's just use
39:43 - my Mac do you have community version of
39:46 - pie chart I've community
39:47 - I prefer Drive it's a Python same I
39:50 - would agree now you your work on
39:53 - localhost no it's not this isn't
39:55 - localhost right now this is um this is
39:58 - working on my like local area network
40:00 - right so so out to 168 0.1 to 1 colon
40:11 - 5,000
40:13 - ok let's say ok Joey is logging in
40:17 - successfully logged in as Joey Joey just
40:20 - left the server ok so this is what I
40:22 - don't want what's showing right now Joey
40:24 - just left the server so I think there's
40:26 - something that I need to hate to handle
40:28 - with the leaving of the server so get
40:32 - history get message get name slash
40:37 - history slash home go
40:41 - man handle my event if name and data
40:44 - okay so from here I'm sending a message
40:48 - when someone leaves that I don't want to
40:52 - add add message msg okay
41:08 - where is just left the server this is
41:17 - what I don't want to do disconnect I
41:21 - don't care about if they leave the
41:23 - server so let's get rid of that for now
41:25 - leave it in as like commented out though
41:28 - slash slash okay
41:31 - now let's just check the history on here
41:35 - so let's go history and there we go okay
41:39 - so it shows messages this I think should
41:41 - be longer on the the history page so
41:44 - when you click history it just refreshes
41:45 - it obviously I'm go to chat you got your
41:48 - main message there history
41:49 - login history chat log now I'm almost
41:54 - thinking in this bar here what I want to
41:56 - do is put like their name if they're
41:58 - logged in or say like logged in as just
42:00 - so like they see it in the bar or say
42:03 - like logged out maybe so like some kind
42:04 - of status logout you were logged out if
42:08 - you had a history please log in before
42:10 - viewing message history okay so let's go
42:13 - Joey all right Joey just left the server
42:16 - that's gonna be in message history Joey
42:18 - just left the server okay nice so that's
42:20 - working
42:21 - I'm thinking maybe now like some headers
42:23 - for these so like you know start
42:25 - chatting or like view message history or
42:28 - like you know something like that let's
42:30 - see what you guys are saying means
42:33 - coding language yeah you guys have any
42:37 - ideas for what you think I should add to
42:39 - this do let me know please okay so I
42:43 - need to fix this leaving the server kind
42:46 - of thing though first okay so let's try
42:49 - to do that
42:53 - - so I have another laptop beside me
42:56 - which is gonna be my handy tester here
42:58 - as we go through this specs empty cache
43:02 - and hard reload shut up history
43:08 - like okay so does it say in chat now
43:14 - Joey left sir okay so I do need to clear
43:18 - this though so if what you guys might
43:21 - not know is when I delete this database
43:23 - what happens is if it gets too late
43:25 - it'll just automatic automatic Li create
43:26 - a new one so I can keep doing that okay
43:29 - so I removed who don't want remove all
43:35 - that it so save that let's refresh okay
43:41 - remove login when logged in remove
43:44 - logout we're not logged in oh good idea
43:49 - so it'll just check if there's a name in
43:51 - the session if there is a key I like
43:54 - that I actually like that a lot because
43:55 - then that's like kind of intuitive but
43:57 - it doesn't necessarily tell you and
43:58 - although I kind of want to say like your
44:00 - name in the top right so I'm gonna do
44:03 - that in the base template so let's now
44:06 - that means that we have to pass every
44:11 - time the session name oh no we can just
44:15 - fetch request it and display it if
44:17 - they're logged in in the bar okay so
44:20 - we'll do it from JavaScript but I need
44:23 - to make something in the bars another
44:24 - linked if then there's their way I can
44:27 - hide yeah I can hide things in
44:30 - JavaScript from the thing okay so let's
44:32 - do that then so window dot onload and
44:38 - here it'll populate it add messages
44:48 - okay I could just write it base mmm
44:53 - this needs to be in the base template
44:56 - sure I think I want to do this just hide
44:59 - it if they don't have a name I'll fetch
45:01 - request to get name if they don't have a
45:03 - name then just okay so we could do that
45:06 - I'd say so you're saying that's name
45:10 - equal weights get name I'm pretty sure
45:17 - get name just returns blank are not
45:21 - getting named load name okay say load
45:25 - name
45:26 - so if name does not equal blank then
45:35 - what we'll do is just add it into the
45:37 - bar or we'll just hide one of the things
45:39 - so to hide which can look up my other
45:42 - computer or actually it let's just go
45:44 - yeah hide HTML tag JavaScript style dot
45:58 - display is that a thing which is there a
46:01 - better way to do that
46:03 - how'd you toggle between hiding and
46:05 - showing an element Oh
46:07 - jQuery hide I kind of like this one
46:09 - buttoned up click function P hide I
46:13 - think I can use that
46:18 - okay so we'll do that now I need to go
46:20 - to history or base and just get some IDs
46:24 - for these tags so say log in log out ID
46:28 - equals log in ID equals log X okay so
46:42 - here star plug in dot hides all same
46:54 - thing but this means I should have to
46:57 - show it again
46:58 - slash next by default it should be okay
47:01 - so log out log in log out okay see if
47:06 - that works
47:09 - yeah okay so currently I'm logged in so
47:12 - just as log out history chat log out now
47:14 - we get the login page okay nice so
47:18 - actually maybe I shouldn't even show
47:20 - anything I should just show login like I
47:22 - know it's fun they can try to click it
47:25 - and it won't work so log in log out okay
47:26 - so I like that log in Tim submit
47:30 - successfully logged in as Tim log out so
47:34 - I'm thinking beside like this thing I
47:36 - just want to show their name like in the
47:37 - top right hand corner of the bar I don't
47:41 - know if that's really necessary let's
47:43 - see what you guys stay in the chat here
47:46 - agreed what development environments
47:55 - okay anyways that'sthat's fun
47:58 - alright so jQuery hide that works pretty
48:00 - well to be honest now I'm thinking maybe
48:03 - some like descriptive text like this so
48:06 - I want to change how this login page
48:09 - looks cuz like look at this light like
48:11 - it looks pretty ugly what I'm picturing
48:13 - is like a big huge text box that says
48:16 - like name and then like linear almost
48:19 - like enter your name name submit button
48:21 - I don't know let's see login
48:25 - page HTML template let's see how I can
48:29 - steal something see like this is kind of
48:33 - what I want but it's just a username and
48:35 - then yeah so like that like something
48:37 - like that is nice let's see can I like
48:41 - just steal download I want to just view
48:49 - HTML this gonna give me like a wordpress
48:54 - theme oh wow it's like that okay all
48:57 - right so let's steal this and then just
49:00 - modify it message animate toggle opacity
49:03 - slow okay so we'll modify that we'll
49:09 - leave the background how we have it okay
49:13 - so let's just go to index space
49:26 - okay so it's a message block lock
49:29 - content posts okay so I need to modify
49:31 - that so this works on so this has type
49:37 - text' ID static name - don't need
49:53 - password login form text placeholder
50:04 - username okay yeah its input name it's
50:13 - fine so I'll leave the placeholders
50:18 - username but yeah just that form
50:43 - [Music]
50:47 - okay some changes here some it's from
50:57 - inline sack name - I'll have to change
51:00 - the styling a little bit on it but
51:02 - should be okay like that okay
51:08 - I could have messed that up pretty badly
51:09 - but we'll see and then let's go take the
51:11 - styling oh my god okay well we'll just
51:19 - do this in line then block title can I
51:24 - like literally just add style I think I
51:26 - can style slash style
51:37 - [Music]
51:41 - type equals text slash CSS okay so it's
51:49 - just a madness of a file but that's okay
51:51 - so this should actually work hopefully
51:52 - div class form I don't think I had like
51:56 - a different ID on the other form um I'm
52:00 - gonna look on get nice yeah it should be
52:03 - okay just say for login form
52:07 - I'm sure my member found a name on that
52:09 - I want to look at the github for a
52:11 - second and that I think I need that dog
52:14 - message I looked up for my animate
52:16 - height toggle opacity toggle although I
52:24 - don't think I even have anything called
52:26 - message yeah no I don't think that
52:27 - matters okay so submit button primary
52:29 - let's see what you guys are saying sent
52:34 - block is JavaScript code now it's not
52:35 - JavaScript code
53:01 - I'm just gonna look at my other
53:02 - JavaScript for a second I know this is
53:04 - like the worst way to do it but it's
53:05 - just um just goes static Jay yes or not
53:12 - jazz what am i doing application
53:15 - templates login see if I had any
53:20 - specific name here no okay so let's run
53:31 - that
53:36 - whoa Oh God
53:42 - okay we'll fix it over I honestly don't
53:53 - really mind the like obviously this box
53:57 - behind it is like pretty broken but I
53:59 - don't really mind the green although I
54:01 - don't really want to keep it green but
54:02 - that's just gonna be some styling now
54:04 - okay so login contain our info and I'm
54:12 - gonna have one of those Tanner in
54:15 - postman I don't I want to lose either
54:17 - continue I fo standard out info h1 don't
54:21 - have one of those either okay
54:22 - Tanner info no container before I
54:25 - believe that container such a relative
54:30 - for message a I don't have any a tags
54:33 - okay so it's form do we have any even
54:39 - message tags we're stealing no so we
54:41 - don't need that she registered for one
54:44 - we do know much but in hover but an
54:49 - active form input form login page okay
54:58 - so let's go back now fresh okay so I
55:03 - still have this container in the back
55:04 - though and I going to assume that's
55:06 - because in the base template I have div
55:09 - container for block content so I'm just
55:12 - going to remove this actually and we'll
55:15 - implement it in the base templates or in
55:18 - the child templates as we please
55:19 - so in login not not in login in like all
55:24 - of them except login will have div
55:26 - container
55:29 - / div in the index / div okay and then
55:44 - was there any other ones no that should
55:46 - be it okay so let's look at this there
55:53 - we go okay so that's nicer immediately I
55:57 - mean I like this a little bit better
55:58 - so just say Tim submit successfully
56:02 - logged in as Tim okay nice
56:04 - so logout I like actually I'm kind of
56:07 - liking this like green button theme to
56:09 - be honest with you yeah okay I'm almost
56:16 - just happy leaving that kind of the way
56:17 - it is right now as a login button I want
56:20 - to see how it looks on my phone actually
56:21 - on mobile and then we'll go from there
56:24 - so let's go what do you guys think Tim
56:28 - you have have you read the book head
56:29 - first Java
56:30 - no I have not
56:35 - okay let's go login oh it looks pretty
56:38 - nice on the phone - oh and it even
56:39 - focuses in when you click on it okay I
56:42 - just want to change this to say name as
56:44 - placeholder because the username
56:46 - lowercase is kind of messing with me but
56:48 - other than that that's fine so let's go
56:52 - shit's wrong one login say name ok
57:01 - actually we'll say your name cuz why not
57:04 - so I like that green so now the idea is
57:07 - like do I accent some other pages with a
57:10 - little bit of green do a bit more
57:11 - styling your name yeah I like that
57:15 - better submit on the history page I want
57:21 - to say okay so Joey left the server
57:27 - that's a 1041 so I'm still getting this
57:30 - damn message leave thing I don't know
57:32 - why though I genuinely don't know why
57:34 - not I completely remove that from my
57:36 - JavaScript make sure that's saved I
57:46 - think it's just like a mess up like with
57:49 - the cache these views
58:03 - let's see what people are saying here
58:05 - okay hey Tim funny thing is I actually
58:14 - just looked at the same article
58:15 - yesterday but ran to an error and didn't
58:17 - have time to study it out I'll have to
58:18 - come watch you later and see how you did
58:20 - Tim have you read black hat pie no send
58:24 - button green as well
58:26 - yeah good idea let's do that let's make
58:28 - it green so whatever I've done for the
58:30 - button forum button hugger forum button
58:38 - even form input I'm gonna say I want to
58:42 - see what happens if I just move these
58:48 - into uh base leave them and the other
58:57 - one for now but let's just see how this
59:01 - looks
59:10 - oh that literally didn't oh it's because
59:14 - these have bootstrap classes on them so
59:16 - I think I need to remove the bootstrap
59:17 - class or at least just change this
59:19 - although what do you guys think like I
59:22 - kind of like the way it is with the gray
59:24 - although that yeah just the send button
59:25 - being green maybe would be a bit better
59:27 - so I don't need to necessarily add all
59:28 - of this for an input dot form button ah
59:35 - - so what does this have color font size
59:41 - transition cursor so hey that's okay so
59:48 - let's go to you index let's add some
59:55 - style tags here so style
59:59 - I'm gonna go ID son bun okay so let's do
60:06 - pound send BTN steal that background and
60:19 - then just remove this class okay send
60:27 - button login grunt outline
60:37 - actually yeah the only I don't want is
60:39 - padding okay let's see how that looks
60:53 - and then get rid of that out of the
60:56 - index actually or out of base I do want
61:02 - that button:hover though okay so let's
61:04 - get rid of that login not login index
61:14 - okay let's see this okay home empty
61:31 - cache every start send ah see I don't
61:35 - know if I'm a fan of that though like
61:37 - how seeds will square rounding off a
61:40 - button I need to be a little bit bigger
61:42 - than that to maybe we will pad it
61:45 - actually border could I do like five
61:47 - here does that what is that gonna do cuz
61:51 - I'm definitely not a fan of that button
61:52 - I might just steal a bootstrap button
61:55 - and actually make it and just make it
61:57 - green so let's just do that boot strap
62:00 - button green like this one see like a
62:08 - button like that is nice see button
62:10 - success just steal that and then put
62:16 - that in here this is my least favorite
62:18 - part of making websites trying to style
62:21 - it just take so long for it we'll leave
62:23 - that WebKit transition with color okay
62:34 - okay that looks much better in my
62:36 - opinion this scent it's obviously a
62:38 - little bit different than the login
62:41 - button see I'm almost considering making
62:43 - this one yeah I want to make this one
62:46 - that class see if that will override too
62:49 - much or not if I make it button success
62:51 - in the other one so let's go login type
62:56 - button button button primary see how
63:01 - guessing really this and then just
63:06 - change the color shape we'll leave color
63:11 - change the background change the font
63:13 - family okay
63:16 - let's see ah okay that looks much better
63:22 - nice okay so I like that a lot better
63:25 - now history please log in before viewing
63:28 - message history okay nice see what
63:31 - everyone's saying here um let's agree
63:35 - that Tim is smart his mind works on
63:36 - different level I don't know if I
63:38 - necessarily agree with that although I
63:40 - would say different yeah for sure it's
63:42 - flask yes I've been watching the stream
63:44 - from the start hi Tim it's my first time
63:46 - watching you live I wish good luck and
63:48 - bye bye guys I'm only really gonna go
63:49 - for another like 10 15 minutes just
63:51 - because um what do you call it
63:54 - I actually have to go to a job interview
63:56 - chemist and so would you actually
63:57 - release the sappers more kind of a
63:58 - project for YouTube definitely more of a
63:59 - project for YouTube like I would
64:01 - consider releasing an app but I just
64:03 - don't know how to code them secure
64:04 - enough that it really is like the scales
64:06 - to like hundreds of thousands of people
64:08 - and I'm not assuming that that many
64:09 - people would actually go on it but I
64:11 - know if I release this on YouTube like I
64:12 - could probably get a few thousand people
64:14 - to actually go on a website and join it
64:16 - and yeah I don't know if that is you
64:19 - know maybe the best idea
64:20 - okay I'm liking this then looks a lot
64:21 - cleaner now I like this green the accent
64:25 - this history page needs to have
64:27 - something fixed though with with this
64:29 - bar because it's like and you said at
64:30 - least show like no message history or
64:32 - something because right now it's kind of
64:34 - boring you need to delete this database
64:36 - again
64:40 - okay
64:41 - so let's go to history and then get
64:48 - scroll height 500 J us this messages
65:00 - don't see us as height messages messages
65:04 - messages so in history ah because it
65:10 - doesn't have that messages div because
65:15 - I'm just showing them here so I need a
65:17 - div that just has messages okay so div
65:25 - div id equals messages okay let's just
65:34 - see what I had an index class
65:36 - overflow:auto oh I just forgot the ID
65:41 - and the other one yeah I think what am i
65:48 - doing putting another div inside one all
65:49 - I need is really just div like this okay
65:55 - so that should work let's go aha
66:00 - beautiful okay so now I'm thinking a
66:02 - little heading at the top like it nice
66:04 - let's actually just go bootstrap
66:05 - headings for a second
66:17 - any ones I can get that are like I don't
66:30 - even anything crazy I don't really want
66:32 - typography just looking for like
66:34 - customized headings fancy headed with
66:41 - phase faded secondary text can just do
66:48 - with like an H for bootstrap heading
66:51 - although I do I kind of want it to be
66:55 - like centered and let's see you know
67:00 - what let's just go with this for now see
67:03 - how this looks for message history okay
67:20 - so let's go here so I don't want to
67:26 - inside that actually though yeah see so
67:39 - that's not what I want it centered okay
67:42 - so Center heading HTML I think I can
67:47 - just do like text-align:center or
67:48 - something
67:50 - yeah line Center very nice
67:58 - although is that gonna put it in the
68:00 - middle of the screen let's see ah you
68:10 - message history okay I mean I feel like
68:12 - that doesn't look that good though or
68:13 - like there's any way I could pad it and
68:16 - make it a little bit bigger
68:17 - okay so let's go h3 style padding : 10
68:28 - pixels ah that looks a lot better okay
68:33 - you message history I almost want like a
68:35 - nice little underline let's see I think
68:37 - they have underline here I'm not
68:42 - necessarily underlined but like line
68:48 - components buttons button group
68:55 - dropdowns form input group list group
68:58 - bar page nation
69:00 - what is pagination oh okay progress
69:04 - tooltips oh that's kind of cool
69:11 - what's actually neat okay so what you
69:14 - guys are saying so guys for everyone
69:19 - asking me now is ask me what language
69:20 - I'm using I'm using like four different
69:22 - languages right or four three I think
69:24 - it's three I don't I'm using HTML CSS
69:27 - JavaScript and Python Python is majority
69:30 - the back end javascript is majority the
69:32 - front end HTML is just displaying stuff
69:34 - and yeah that's pretty much what it is
69:36 - okay I want colors display I spelt like
69:45 - a line like I've seen it before spacing
69:51 - text
69:58 - okay let's just look for this mm strap
70:04 - line okay give me a line horizontal
70:08 - divider if you want to divide it with
70:23 - text in the middle let's see what this
70:28 - does
70:37 - just curious so I'll go like this the
70:42 - message history
70:43 - oh that give me a play yeah for sure
70:59 - that could definitely be it okay div
71:03 - stick what I had here
71:16 - what do you guys think like a nice
71:18 - a-line like that like I feel like that
71:20 - looks kind of kind of cool or I could
71:22 - put a line like underneath it just seems
71:25 - like cuz the padding is like kind of
71:27 - messing it up almost if you like let's
71:29 - see if I get rid of the padding we put
71:32 - the padding like on the road Dave
71:34 - instead although that's just gonna apply
71:43 - to everything inside of it now um okay
71:48 - let's just see this padding Cadieux
71:56 - there's a way to do like padding top is
71:58 - it like that cuz I just really wanted
72:00 - off the top oh yeah there we go view
72:04 - message history let's see more spacing
72:12 - between the text and the header
72:15 - okay you can do let's see what
72:18 - everyone's saying here let's see okay I
72:29 - actually think this looks kind of nice I
72:30 - mean like maybe it's not perfect but
72:33 - like it's kind of nice it's good chat
72:35 - I almost want to do the same thing here
72:37 - with the chat and say like start
72:39 - chatting or something like because now
72:41 - it seems like it could be consistent
72:43 - which means I almost want to put this
72:45 - well I'm just gonna copy then the other
72:46 - one it's fun detainer start chatting
72:57 - okay
72:58 - which means index touch yes this is
73:00 - gonna go down to be 72 minus 250 okay
73:22 - there we go so I like that start
73:24 - chatting history view message history I
73:29 - don't know why it's yeah it's always
73:32 - staying so I don't to fix that in the
73:34 - bar too okay so let's go to base now I'm
73:39 - var toggler okay no bar not active do
73:48 - you guys know how to make it so it
73:49 - changes which one's active based on what
73:52 - ones click done um don't know if that's
73:54 - a thing or if it should automatically do
73:55 - that maybe chat history logout history
74:00 - okay okay um nice yeah
74:05 - and then we have a little login button
74:07 - click Submit
74:10 - okay so let's do some dislike last
74:12 - minute testing and then I'm probably
74:13 - gonna call it the end of the stream
74:15 - actually I don't really know how long
74:16 - I've been going for think like started
74:18 - at 9:45 can hour and 15 months maybe
74:21 - okay so let's just login as someone's
74:24 - name in here a v ---b let's login as u v
74:30 - ---b okay successfully logged in as a
74:32 - beep close that let's go what is up send
74:39 - okay so now here to clear this cache
74:52 - sorry then just on my laptop right now
74:54 - just to test this so let's go and we'll
74:57 - login as Tim on this one submit okay so
75:02 - now I'll just start chatting over here
75:05 - nothing much how about you send okay so
75:11 - there we go and then we'll just say same
75:17 - old you know okay so now if we go to
75:21 - history ah okay so history is messing up
75:25 - what is up same old you know what is up
75:27 - nothing much we meet same up
75:30 - so that's sending it twice okay so view
75:34 - message history since it's a pending in
75:36 - there every time I add it it should just
75:38 - refresh okay so I think I know what to
75:40 - do okay so let's go to history message
75:50 - unless those messages are being saved
75:52 - twice potentially though I don't think
75:55 - they are is if they're being saved twice
75:57 - I mean if i refresh this see log out
76:03 - okay so I'm just checking something on
76:05 - my laptop
76:08 - okay so the history tab kind of broke
76:11 - there for a second
76:12 - because I really just like history
76:15 - should just show me oh because maybe it
76:18 - has the same name so that's why ah okay
76:21 - so ID cuz message is in the history tab
76:26 - which means the Java scripts actually
76:27 - updating this when it shouldn't be ID
76:30 - equals messages one I'm just gonna do
76:33 - that because when I go to JavaScript so
76:38 - now unless I can just make this can I
76:41 - make this a class in here and effect a
76:42 - class yeah let's make class messages so
76:48 - instead of history plus equals MSG's
77:02 - okay that if we go to next go to next
77:07 - touch yes Josh honest yes and then we
77:14 - need to go to base not base index and
77:17 - give because this is an overflow:auto
77:21 - class can I add more than one class C
77:24 - more than one class HTML yes
77:32 - do you just oh you just throw the right
77:34 - class C yep right after it okay so how
77:38 - does Jess okay so let's see if that is
77:40 - gonna work ah there we go okay so that's
77:45 - exactly what I figured so history okay
77:47 - so chats boom sweet so that's working
77:50 - okay um yeah and in fact so the chat one
77:55 - should be this big the history one
77:58 - should be a little bit bigger actually

79:11 - bought to command right now while
79:12 - watching hello there I just joined
79:14 - what's up please tell socket function
79:16 - hello I love programming in Python I
79:19 - wish I was better any tips for
79:21 - improvement keep practicing don't give
79:23 - up on it why not use vs code I don't
79:25 - know I just I like pie chart makes sense
79:26 - for what I'm doing all the vs code
79:28 - probably would be better for this hi Tim
79:29 - music is great awesome thank you how'd
79:31 - you get into coding so early there
79:33 - family history not really I actually
79:35 - just have always been like interested in
79:36 - how things worked and I one day just
79:38 - looked up like coding and kind of fell
79:40 - in love with it and started going on my
79:41 - journey being becoming a programmer Tim
79:45 - how do you make money with coding start
79:46 - a YouTube channel get a job I don't know
79:48 - there's lots of ways to make money with
79:49 - coding in fact it's one of the
79:50 - highest-paying kind of careers to make a
79:53 - website you can make startup you could
79:55 - do freelance you could tutor people you
79:57 - literally could start a YouTube channel
79:58 - I mean you guys are aware this makes me
80:00 - money by the way Tim thanks for your
80:02 - videos watch your Python project video
80:03 - today and made Tic Tac Toe with computer
80:05 - moves thanks no problem missed the
80:07 - beginning is the block complete pretty
80:08 - much so annoying I turned in at the end
80:11 - sorry guys I wish I would have gone for
80:12 - longer and I'll probably will continue
80:14 - doing more live streams because they're
80:15 - just so easy to get up and do like an
80:16 - hour and a half or two hour one and then
80:19 - you know we will in about a week and a
80:21 - half I'll end up doing one that's
80:22 - probably like you know 12 hours like
80:24 - we've done before recently how to
80:26 - software
80:26 -  and c-sharp what books do you
80:28 - recommend reading
80:30 - I don't read any programming books so I
80:32 - couldn't give you anything for that
80:33 - thanks to your content no problem K last
80:36 - chance here guys I'm gonna give it like
80:37 - two three minutes I'm gonna hop off you
80:39 - have anything more you want to ask this
80:40 - is the opportunity to do so we would
80:43 - love more live streams awesome yeah if
80:44 - you guys like one a live stream leave a
80:46 - like on this one right now let me know
80:48 - that's how I kind of know what you guys
80:49 - want let's look at the analytics on this
80:52 - live stream we take a second it's
80:54 - already six thousand people have played
80:55 - back this stream that's pretty
80:57 - impressive how are using sockets for web
81:00 - it's flask IO sockets I mean I know how
81:03 - old you are I'm 19
81:04 - I like the live streams nice that's good
81:06 - to know bro you looking so good thank
81:11 - you
81:12 - what's the best way to learn programming
81:13 - um by doing it I mean like that's kind
81:17 - of a hard question to answer that's like
81:18 - what's the best way to learn math well
81:19 - you got to do math to learn math right
81:21 - I don't know watch youtube videos tech
81:23 - with tim youtube channel but then
81:25 - actually on your own time don't just
81:26 - fall along the toriel's actually start
81:28 - programming things and exploring and
81:29 - working on projects we do some we could
81:33 - do some a series of making some smoked
81:35 - cool projects and live streams yeah be
81:37 - nice to do that I could I've been
81:38 - thinking about doing like the one hour
81:40 - pie game competition where I have like
81:42 - one hour just make the best game and pie
81:44 - game that I can make cuz I'd be a speed
81:46 - coding for an hour which would be kind
81:49 - of cool were you born in 2000 I was
81:51 - where'd you learn all these just a lot
81:53 - practice man you have any recommendation
81:55 - for starting learning machine learning
81:57 - watch my course on machine learning it's
81:59 - pretty beginner friendly I have like a
82:00 - big six hour one that combines a bunch
82:02 - of stuff that's pretty good is there way
82:04 - where I can run flasks in debug mode
82:06 - from the run button and pycharm no no
82:08 - you just have to like set debug mode in
82:11 - the thing
82:12 - it's a weird I'm studying it's what is
82:14 - this physiology I think that's how you
82:17 - say I'm listening to this at the same
82:18 - time no that's pretty normal I feel like
82:20 - this is interesting like regardless of
82:21 - what faculty are in our program do you
82:24 - learn different types of algorithms sure
82:26 - how long you've been coding like six
82:28 - seven years will you ever make a yuna me
82:30 - course I will never make eight you
82:31 - actually I don't wanna say that
82:32 - definitively but chancellor I will not
82:34 - make it you to me course I might make a
82:35 - course on some other platform there's
82:37 - not a fan of udemy can you tell me
82:39 - developers easy
82:40 - nope I can't tell you that do you have
82:42 - kind of platform probably where I could
82:44 - inquire in case I'm stuck when I'm doing
82:46 - my Python projects unfortunately I get a
82:49 - ridiculous amount of emails so if you
82:51 - email me a question I I'm just gonna be
82:53 - blunt I'm not gonna answer you I mean
82:55 - you can follow me on Twitter Instagram
82:56 - and I might be able to respond to you
82:58 - but discord is probably the best place
83:00 - if you guys joined my discord servers
83:01 - link in the description we have a bunch
83:03 - of staff Aviv's here he's in the chat
83:05 - he's one of our staff members or he was
83:06 - at least um and they're always open to
83:08 - be helping you and there's like like
83:09 - there's four thousand five thousand
83:11 - people in the discord server that are
83:12 - just kind of helping out so that's kind
83:14 - of the community for attack with Tim um
83:16 - could you please create standalone
83:18 - server on Raspberry Pi for website yeah
83:20 - I mean I've literally done that already
83:22 - all I need to do now is just put on my
83:23 - Raspberry Pi standalone server there you
83:25 - go right it's just that's another piece
83:27 - of hardware if you make a server on
83:28 - anything you can make one on a Raspberry
83:29 - Pi wrap up today's topics please and
83:32 - thank you
83:34 - I mean I've kind of already gone through
83:35 - it so I'm not gonna do that completely
83:37 - the coding yeah pretty much
83:38 - how'd you learn programming how did you
83:40 - learn so much you guys asked me how I
83:42 - learned so much just a lot of hard work
83:43 - a lot of learning I mean like wake up
83:46 - every morning learn something new that's
83:47 - genuinely like a philosophy of mine
83:50 - there's not a day I go where I'm not
83:52 - learning something new so that's kind of
83:53 - the thing you know there's not really
83:54 - any days off
83:56 - I think Tim blocked me because I don't
83:58 - see my messages live well I can see them
84:00 - DK Gupta PHP is much easier and you can
84:03 - create route app in less than one hour
84:04 - yeah I'm sure you could make one but I
84:06 - don't like PHP so um yeah okay you know
84:09 - what guys this has been a wonderful
84:11 - shorter livestream if you guys enjoyed
84:12 - these shorter kind of live streams I'd
