00:03 - foreign
00:08 - so what I'm about to show you here is
00:10 - both terrifying and exciting now I say
00:13 - that as someone who's very involved in
00:14 - Tech I keep up to date with machine
00:16 - learning and all the trends that are
00:17 - going on and the tech that I just used
00:19 - and I'm going to demo in this video I
00:22 - really don't know how to feel about on
00:24 - one hand I think it's very cool I think
00:25 - it's exciting it's interesting and it
00:27 - has a lot of potential on the other hand
00:29 - it's pretty terrifying what this is
00:31 - capable of doing and the fact that this
00:33 - is currently only in a research preview
00:35 - it's not even fully finished and it
00:37 - really does have the capability to wipe
00:39 - out Millions upon millions of jobs and
00:41 - even make what I'm doing right now which
00:43 - is kind of creating videos demoing
00:44 - explaining stuff to you on the internet
00:46 - pretty obsolete anyways let me dive in
00:49 - and just show you what this thing does
00:50 - so if you don't know what I'm talking
00:51 - about of course this is gpt3 the say
00:54 - language model provided by open AI it's
00:57 - currently under a research preview it's
00:59 - free to use right now if you want to
01:00 - check it out I will leave a link in the
01:01 - description I highly recommend you play
01:03 - around with it as it says here there's
01:05 - you know some examples of stuff we can
01:06 - type in so if I just copy you know
01:07 - explain Quantum Computing in simple
01:09 - terms of course it's going to go through
01:11 - here and kind of explain that to me now
01:14 - that's pretty basic you know Google can
01:16 - do that that's fine however the power of
01:18 - this model is it is kind of contextual
01:20 - and it remembers stuff so what that
01:22 - means is that I can have a full-on
01:23 - conversation with this and it can use
01:25 - context from prior in the conversation
01:27 - it also can like revise answers and
01:30 - generate entire web pages ideas all
01:33 - kinds of stuff so I have a bunch of
01:34 - examples that I've kind of tested out
01:36 - before that I'm just going to copy in uh
01:38 - just to save us some time and I can show
01:39 - you quickly some of the capabilities of
01:41 - this so I'm going to paste in
01:43 - this here that says generate the HTML
01:45 - for the landing page of a website that
01:47 - explains the importance of healthy diet
01:49 - and active lifestyle focus on the
01:51 - importance of energy and eating the
01:52 - correct Foods
01:53 - okay so first of all it gives me kind of
01:55 - the code block here and it just starts
01:57 - typing uh the the HTML right now in this
02:00 - case it's not giving me any styling but
02:01 - I'll show you later that you can ask
02:03 - this to add styling add animations it's
02:06 - pretty Limited in terms of images but
02:08 - you can see that this is just doing what
02:10 - I would typically have to pay someone on
02:11 - like five or you know a few bucks to
02:13 - actually write out so I won't read
02:14 - through this but you can see that it's
02:16 - kind of done what I said here it has
02:17 - some tags the importance of healthy diet
02:20 - and active lifestyle eating the right
02:22 - Foods conclusion Etc okay the benefits
02:25 - of an active lifestyle you guys can read
02:26 - through that if you want now the cool
02:28 - thing right is that okay I'm working on
02:29 - this website now I'm creating a health
02:31 - website now I'm going to ask you to
02:33 - generate other Pages for this Health
02:34 - Website so I'm going to say now create a
02:36 - purchase page where users can buy a
02:38 - subscription in My Weekly Newsletter
02:39 - that provides tips tricks and advice for
02:42 - living a happy and healthy life and
02:43 - notice my English is not even correct
02:45 - here I'm making typos and mistakes and
02:47 - it can still understands
02:48 - so there you go it even generates a form
02:50 - where I guess you can sign up for the
02:52 - newsletter right so there you go now
02:55 - continuing I can ask you to do something
02:56 - like create a frequently asked questions
02:58 - page that answers questions related to
03:00 - the price of subscription how the
03:02 - subscription can be canceled and when it
03:03 - begins now I'm intentionally being vague
03:05 - here but you can also be extremely
03:07 - detailed and it will give you you know
03:09 - whatever level of detail that you ask
03:11 - for so there you go now that generates
03:13 - the FAQ and boom I would copy all this
03:16 - put it in a website and there you go I
03:18 - just saved myself probably an hour of
03:19 - typing all of this up obviously not
03:22 - perfect but you get the idea and in
03:24 - terms of subscription costs and whatnot
03:25 - it kind of just Auto generated that I
03:27 - could have typed that if I want okay so
03:29 - that was one example another website I
03:31 - have or another example I have is also a
03:33 - website and it's this create a good
03:35 - looking website that uses CSS animations
03:36 - this website name is Tech with Tim and
03:39 - should have various programming
03:40 - languages moving around the screen
03:41 - background should be code that is
03:43 - scrolling down the screen like the
03:44 - Matrix make sure it is dark themed okay
03:47 - let's see what it does here and I will
03:49 - actually take this and throw it on the
03:51 - web so you can actually see what it
03:52 - looks like all right so this is what it
03:54 - generated uh notice it kind of has this
03:56 - animation it messed up the animation but
03:58 - you get the point right learn
03:59 - programming with Tim check out our
04:01 - tutorials on the following languages and
04:02 - then it's supposed to be animating these
04:04 - obviously it messed it up but you get
04:05 - the idea I didn't really ask for
04:06 - anything too detailed and boom it kind
04:08 - of generated this website for us with a
04:10 - cool font so just again another example
04:13 - of what this thing is capable of doing
04:14 - now continuing I think really what's
04:17 - going to be most useful for especially
04:18 - students is generating ideas generating
04:21 - thesis rewriting paragraphs correcting
04:23 - answers uh really the possibilities are
04:26 - endless but I have a few more examples
04:27 - so for example write a thesis for an
04:29 - essay on the character development of
04:30 - piggy in The Lord of the Flies I don't
04:33 - know North America here this is a like
04:34 - pretty popular book Lord of the Flies
04:36 - I'm sure you guys probably know this and
04:38 - we had to write all kinds of essays and
04:40 - stuff so imagine you know in grade seven
04:42 - or grade nine or whenever we read this
04:44 - that I could just go to gpt3 ask it to
04:46 - write me a thesis and literally finish
04:48 - it I say in a matter of minutes as
04:50 - opposed to hours by getting it to the
04:52 - right paragraphs and giving it like a
04:54 - general broad outline of what I wanted
04:55 - so there you go it gave me a thesis now
04:57 - if I wanted more I could say Okay
04:59 - add more detail and it'll just go and
05:03 - again it'll probably repeat most of this
05:04 - but it will add more detail into the
05:06 - thesis for me there you go we got
05:08 - another paragraph and I don't know how
05:09 - long this is going to continue to go for
05:10 - give me YouTube video title ideas for a
05:13 - video that discusses how gpt3 is
05:15 - replacing programmers okay and there you
05:19 - go it gives me a bunch of video ideas
05:20 - like I can't tell you how helpful this
05:22 - would have been to use for wealth just
05:24 - like all kinds of YouTube video titles
05:26 - or I could punch in my title and say
05:28 - make it more catchy or give me a better
05:30 - description
05:31 - all right uh there you go now next in
05:34 - terms of more specific stuff to coding I
05:36 - can say write me the a-star pathfinding
05:39 - algorithm with a visualization in
05:40 - JavaScript and then that's the next one
05:42 - which is right heapsort but it just goes
05:45 - and it just knows how to do like
05:47 - literally all of this and I'll show you
05:48 - some more specific examples too because
05:50 - I know this is pretty General but you
05:52 - can describe like a game or any kind of
05:54 - program you want and similar to
05:55 - something like uh what we call this
05:57 - copilot it just it just makes it for you
06:00 - this is
06:01 - I don't know it's it's pretty terrifying
06:04 - to be honest considering you guys would
06:06 - pay me to explain this to you meanwhile
06:07 - you can just go here and it literally
06:09 - just spits out the code so there you go
06:11 - you get a star pathfinding algorithm
06:12 - with a visualization uh another one here
06:14 - this is like a way more specific one uh
06:16 - let me copy this here
06:18 - uh this is write a Firebase query using
06:21 - typescript that retrieves all of the
06:22 - documents from the score collection
06:24 - where the field game uid is equal to
06:25 - soccer and the date added field is no
06:27 - older than two days
06:29 - and let's see if it can do this and yeah
06:31 - this is again exactly what I would do
06:34 - and that I do do pretty much every
06:35 - single day when I'm working with
06:37 - Firebase
06:38 - there you go another one here
06:40 - let me copy this in
06:42 - is write me a function in typescript
06:44 - that accepts an array of user objects
06:46 - each user object has a sport and a
06:47 - position field the function
06:50 - should this function organize each user
06:51 - by its sport imposition and return
06:53 - object of arrays that contain all of the
06:55 - users sorted by their Sport and position
06:56 - so again not the best English but it's
06:58 - giving that to me defines the user type
07:00 - and writes out the typescript function
07:02 - and even comments every single line that
07:04 - it's doing
07:05 - so I think you know I can leave it at
07:07 - that you guys can go and experiment with
07:09 - this on your own but it is really crazy
07:11 - what this can do
07:13 - um and I'm really just getting started
07:14 - with I'm sure there's way more stuff it
07:15 - can do that I haven't even demoed here
07:17 - now one last thing I'll mention is that
07:20 - someone actually created a virtual
07:22 - machine inside of this chat GPT program
07:25 - uh you can read through this article
07:27 - I'll link it in the description but
07:28 - essentially you know I want you to act
07:30 - as Linux terminal and then whenever they
07:32 - typed commands it just acted like a
07:34 - Linux terminal and literally had a
07:37 - virtual machine inside of it where they
07:38 - would do kind of what I would demo on
07:40 - like a virtual private server or
07:42 - something along those lines so if you
07:43 - want to check that out I'll leave it in
07:45 - the description I don't need to go
07:46 - through that whole article that's what I
07:47 - wanted to show you
07:49 - um I think this is pretty insane I don't
07:51 - know what you guys think I don't know if
07:52 - you've messed around with this and what
07:54 - you've seen it be able to do I really
07:56 - just learned about this a few hours ago
07:57 - and I was like I need to make a video
07:58 - and tell people because this is just
08:00 - crazy so anyways let me know what you
08:02 - guys think in the comments down below
08:03 - let me know what you've got this thing
08:04 - to do uh it's cool but at the same time
08:07 - I don't know it's pretty scary to me
08:09 - with that said I hope you guys enjoyed
08:10 - if you did leave a like subscribe the
08:12 - channel and I will see you in the next
08:14 - one
