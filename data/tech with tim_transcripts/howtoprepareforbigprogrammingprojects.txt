00:00 - now the next thing to talk about here is
00:01 - the fact that a lot of people jump into
00:03 - projects or start doing things and they
00:05 - have absolutely no idea what's involved
00:07 - in it they have no idea what they're
00:08 - getting themselves into now let's say
00:10 - this is specific to Python and you want
00:12 - to program neural networks and make
00:13 - machine learning applications come up
00:15 - with a plan and figure out if this is
00:17 - even possible to do with your current
00:19 - knowledge base because you don't want to
00:21 - be wasting your time trying to implement
00:23 - this crazy complicated algorithm or do
00:25 - this ridiculous thing try to figure out
00:27 - what you should be doing do some
00:29 - research make a plan and then that way
00:31 - when you start programming you'll have a
00:32 - better idea of what you need to do
00:34 - that's going to save you a lot of time
00:35 - from just you know checking and guessing
00:37 - and doing all that which happens all the
00:38 - time
