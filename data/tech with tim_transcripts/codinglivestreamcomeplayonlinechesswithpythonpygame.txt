00:00 - if you're playing game of chess and the
00:01 - server goes down or you get disconnected
00:02 - or something like that um but yeah so
00:07 - anyway slip I'll be live right now okay
00:16 - so I'm sorry I just had an issue with
00:18 - the stream I don't know what you guys
00:19 - heard or what you didn't hear let me
00:21 - know but again online multiplayer chess
00:24 - we're gonna be playing this today
00:25 - there's a bunch of bugs we need to
00:26 - figure out we're gonna be doing that for
00:28 - the first 15 20 minutes please don't get
00:30 - too frustrated if we go through stuff
00:32 - and I've already repeated this I'm sorry
00:33 - but um I don't know if you guys can see
00:35 - me or not again this is always a bit
00:37 - buggy alright so first of all before I
00:39 - get too far into the stream I need to
00:41 - give a massive shout-out to cherry
00:43 - servers for hooking me up with a really
00:45 - awesome server for today's stream I'm
00:47 - gonna be using the server for a few
00:48 - videos in future series as well and
00:51 - anyways just massive shout out to cherry
00:53 - servers definitely go check out their
00:55 - website here you can rent servers for
00:57 - like 10 15 cents an hour they're really
01:00 - good they have an awesome support team
01:01 - and they've just been a pleasure to work
01:03 - with so massive shout to them definitely
01:04 - check out their website there's a link
01:06 - in the description and again just thank
01:08 - you guys so much from cherry servers
01:09 - because without you this would not have
01:11 - been paulus have been possible alright
01:13 - so now let me show you guys how you can
01:16 - actually connect and start playing this
01:18 - game so a little tutorial first so that
01:21 - everyone knows how to kind of get set up
01:22 - here so if you're tuning into the stream
01:24 - later just I guess rewind back and see
01:26 - this but anyways if you go to my github
01:28 - link in the description link in the
01:30 - pinned comment you should see a page
01:33 - that looks like this now there's a
01:35 - readme file here and it literally just
01:37 - goes through exactly how to do
01:38 - everything
01:39 - so what you need to do is download this
01:41 - repository and run the game dot PI file
01:43 - now I tried to make this as intuitive as
01:46 - possible
01:46 - and when you run the game top high file
01:48 - I wrote a script that should
01:49 - automatically install PI game and pip
01:51 - for you if this doesn't work you're
01:54 - gonna have to mess with installing pip
01:55 - and PI game yourself again let me know
01:57 - if there's any issues use the stream
01:59 - chat use the github chat for issues I'm
02:02 - gonna be checking and we're kind of just
02:03 - gonna be tweaking things to the first
02:04 - 15-20 minutes so please you know bear
02:07 - with me on that guys
02:09 - but anyways follow this instructions try
02:11 - to connect the servers live right now if
02:12 - you double
02:13 - click the game top high file you should
02:15 - actually get hooked up I can see a few
02:16 - people joining on the server right now
02:18 - and before we you know go too far I will
02:21 - kind of walk through some of the code
02:23 - and how this works but if you guys want
02:24 - to go in the background and kind of be
02:25 - listening to this while I go through the
02:28 - instructions feel free we've already got
02:29 - 4 people connected to games going and
02:32 - yeah we'll just be going through all
02:34 - that so do this get this working github
02:36 - link in the description I'm just
02:37 - repeating this because everyone is like
02:40 - just joining in the stream so I want to
02:41 - make sure people see it if they're just
02:42 - coming on now but remind people in the
02:45 - stream chat and all of that so the
02:47 - server specs that I actually got I got a
02:49 - 4 core or starting out 4 core 4 Xeon
02:52 - processors to 1080 TI's the one i have
02:56 - is actually only 16 gigabytes of ram but
02:59 - i was supposed to get 64 but like
03:01 - something messed up with that and then i
03:02 - think i have like what do you call it
03:05 - some i don't know how much space at like
03:07 - 250 gigabyte SSD or something uh alright
03:10 - let me just see what's going on here i'm
03:12 - running into a few issues on the server
03:13 - again guys i gotta fix a bunch of stuff
03:15 - as we go through but that's what I'm
03:17 - gonna be doing now just fixing some of
03:18 - the stuff on the server side and just
03:20 - bear with me keep connecting the server
03:22 - try to play the games if you run into
03:23 - bugs please let me know inside because
03:26 - I'm relying on you guys to help me test
03:28 - this out and then I also implemented a
03:30 - spectator mode into this because it
03:33 - we're getting key errors here yeah you
03:37 - guys can't connect Kay I'm gonna shut
03:39 - down the server right now guys I'll be
03:40 - back on in one second oh just there's a
03:42 - key error I know how to fix this it just
03:44 - gonna take a second because when you
03:45 - guys are connecting to the games it's
03:47 - just it's a little buggy here I'm so Len
03:49 - of games ok I see here
03:53 - so if connections watches 2 equals 0
03:55 - yeah so again guys just get that stuff
03:58 - going and then we'll we'll get this all
04:00 - working here I just gotta figure out
04:01 - this issue because I have something
04:03 - where like each game is represented by a
04:05 - key in the dictionary if you join the
04:07 - key era can sometimes be off um and and
04:11 - only that so we'll have to fix and work
04:13 - with this what I might actually do is
04:17 - just get it so that
04:19 - this is gonna be a little bit difficult
04:21 - G equals zero let's see here I think I'm
04:27 - just gonna pick a game that doesn't have
04:29 - two connections on it and add you on
04:30 - that how big is the foot you guys asked
04:32 - me all these questions I'll get to them
04:33 - in a second I just really want to get
04:34 - this working with the key areas I
04:36 - haven't had many people on it at once so
04:38 - again we're gonna have some issues going
04:39 - as we get through here is the line of
04:42 - games minus zero is this open source
04:45 - yeah guys this is open source you can go
04:47 - look at everything on github okay
04:50 - so let's just get a list of all the keys
04:53 - and then we'll assign a player based on
04:55 - the amount of connections oh we
04:57 - shouldn't do it based on connections
04:58 - because then connections are just 2
05:01 - equals equals zero yeah so this was an
05:03 - issue I knew I was gonna run into
05:05 - creating new games so this is gonna be
05:09 - difficult to create new games and assign
05:11 - people into the games I haven't had this
05:14 - many people connect and even with you
05:15 - guys like 10 20 people connecting it um
05:17 - it just broke here so we'll have to see
05:19 - how to fix this so what I was trying to
05:22 - do right now is say after every 2 people
05:24 - connect it um creates a new game but
05:27 - what was happening was if people are
05:28 - connecting and they're just instantly
05:29 - leaving and then it wasn't working okay
05:31 - let's just do it we'll do one more test
05:33 - run with this server running and then
05:35 - see if we can get this to to work ok
05:38 - guys to try to connect to the game
05:41 - connection reset by P try to connect I'm
05:43 - gonna be monitoring this server here and
05:45 - I might even connect in a second as you
05:47 - might get my spectator mode to work but
05:48 - I need you guys to connect before I can
05:50 - see if everything is actually working or
05:51 - not
05:52 - again if you're unfamiliar with how to
05:54 - do this this should be the repo that you
05:57 - download should look like this except
05:58 - you want to have this server file most
05:59 - likely and then just double click on
06:01 - game and it should load you up into the
06:03 - chess game I'm gonna show you guys what
06:05 - it looks like in a second but I need
06:06 - enough people to connect it I can get in
06:08 - what's called spectator mode let me see
06:10 - what I can do this now other player left
06:13 - spectator mode is not working so I gotta
06:16 - fix that too Oh a bunch of people are
06:19 - leaving new player connected connection
06:21 - reset by pier number of connections
06:23 - through a number of games to let me know
06:25 - if this is working for you guys or not
06:26 - if you're in games or not because
06:29 - again I don't know game one ended player
06:36 - none left game one kierra player left
06:39 - yeah okay I don't think this is working
06:40 - yet guys so we gotta give it a second
06:42 - here if you're in the game please let me
06:44 - know in the chat guys I haven't heard
06:45 - set had anyone tell me about any issues
06:47 - or not in the chat yet so I gotta see
06:50 - okay I'm gonna stop the server and we're
06:52 - just gonna get this this fixed currently
06:54 - because this is a bit of an issue so I
06:57 - was having this thing where I was like
06:58 - deleting games I think I'm just gonna
07:00 - stop deleting games and just add more
07:02 - keys into the dictionary so when I
07:05 - create a new game so game connections
07:08 - but oh that's why it's not working okay
07:11 - so we'll say current underscore game
07:16 - underscore ID again guys just give me a
07:17 - minute or two let me know if you have
07:18 - any bugs please I really do care if you
07:21 - have the bugs because I need to fix them
07:22 - yeah I know the server's offline is
07:23 - going online in a second okay so we'll
07:25 - say G equals current underscore game
07:31 - underscore ID and we'll just say after
07:34 - every two connections so it'll say like
07:36 - yeah if connections modules two equals
07:39 - zero
07:39 - then we'll just create a new game with
07:40 - current game ID so current current
07:44 - underscore game ID underscore game
07:49 - underscore ID and then we'll add one to
07:51 - that okay so that needs to be
07:54 - incremented plus equals one and then G
08:01 - equals current game ID and then Ralad we
08:04 - won't delete any games which is what I
08:06 - was doing at some point here F Dell yeah
08:10 - we don't need to do this game ended get
08:14 - rid of that
08:16 - okay so let's try this now I just got to
08:19 - push this code over to the server and
08:22 - then we should be able to actually run
08:24 - that desktop chess game server I'm
08:28 - hoping this is as easy as the fixes
08:30 - because if it's not then you know we're
08:32 - gonna be run into some issues here I'm
08:33 - also just gonna modify this specs file
08:36 - all right
08:40 - okay run that no it's not what I want to
08:43 - do same thing again okay there we go all
08:49 - right let's go guys connect now and see
08:52 - if this is working
08:53 - I've already have two games new player
08:55 - connected number of connections 1 number
08:57 - of games
08:57 - oh yeah the number of games output here
09:00 - is gonna be wrong but that's fine let me
09:01 - try to connect now I had this all
09:02 - working before I don't know what's going
09:04 - on I think it's just you guys are
09:05 - flooding me with games and I don't know
09:06 - I didn't code the server well enough to
09:08 - handle this let's run a game name there
09:13 - we go so I'm waiting for player let's
09:14 - see if someone else joins in if I can
09:15 - get in the game with someone here so
09:17 - whoever's gonna join next is gonna be in
09:18 - my game oh there we go I'm in a game ok
09:20 - let's select let me play ok um his turn
09:26 - holy crap a lot of you guys are joining
09:28 - oh my god ok well I did not expect this
09:33 - to happen I did not expect this many
09:35 - people to have to join the game
09:37 - immediately Jesus okay yeah this will be
09:40 - interesting to see if this works if you
09:41 - guys can see my this is my server screen
09:43 - right now oh my god okay people are
09:46 - leaving people are joining yeah oh this
09:48 - is gonna be really interesting okay
09:50 - whoever's playing against me needs to
09:52 - make a move because I'm waiting for them
09:54 - right now I'm gonna have to leave the
09:55 - game if they take too long holy crap
09:59 - Jesus
10:03 - yeah if you guys can't tell us a little
10:05 - bit
10:06 - some guy named himself hey Tim Tims time
10:08 - oh I'm waiting player to left this game
10:10 - clearly block is winner okay let me just
10:12 - do this again um oh my god okay I'll run
10:20 - through all this code works but I want
10:21 - to see if this is gonna work Tim let's
10:24 - run a game here okay I'm with blue jay
10:27 - all right blue jay your turn buddy let's
10:28 - go what's okay he moved there on black
10:34 - alright let's see if he can play with me
10:36 - by the way guys you see this mug
10:37 - available for purchase you can go right
10:40 - underneath he wears it underneath the
10:42 - description you should be able to see
10:43 - that so I'm just testing out the game
10:45 - this is what it looks like I'm in a game
10:47 - right now with blue jay it seems to be
10:48 - working but yeah let me know if you guys
10:52 - what's going on with you ran out of
10:53 - input on pickling stack under flow
10:55 - service server offline okay that's an
10:58 - issue there's gonna be a lot of stuff
10:59 - that I'm gonna need to fix here and by
11:01 - the way I'm just gonna like don't get
11:02 - too attached to your chess game because
11:04 - I'm gonna have to shut down the server
11:05 - at random times and fix stuff but I
11:07 - don't know I think this is pretty
11:08 - interesting and you guys can see the
11:09 - kind of I look at my server code right
11:12 - now look what's happening look how many
11:13 - people are connected I have these
11:16 - connections are wrong we have 40 not
11:18 - that's wrong for games to like people
11:20 - are just joining leaving you can see
11:21 - this guy left game 48 alright
11:26 - see I just keep joining in guys we'll
11:28 - keep testing this and this probably is
11:31 - about like 24 hours worth of coding
11:33 - because the stream that I did it in I
11:35 - only went for 18 hours
11:37 - did I not move what is happening here
11:44 - yeah this is not correct
11:48 - I'm trying to join a game but I'm still
11:50 - waiting server offline yeah this is
11:52 - gonna be a little bit of fixing so the
11:54 - stream might go longer than I expected
11:55 - um okay let me quit this game
11:58 - he can be the winner of that one and
12:00 - let's get in a new one and see what I
12:02 - can get going here there's some latency
12:03 - issues here um oh my god
12:07 - okay join all right I am block there
12:13 - turn who's going here
12:14 - Sahil is playing that right now joins
12:18 - time oh my god
12:20 - okay yeah so clearly this this is not
12:25 - working at the same level that I I
12:27 - thought it would well we'll see if we
12:31 - can get this going soon oh my god okay
12:35 - guys let me know your your errors please
12:37 - send them in the chat because I need to
12:39 - know what is going on here Tim see
12:43 - player one time Tim time okay I can move
12:48 - but it still says player one I don't
12:49 - even know if I'm in a game with someone
12:51 - oh my god okay he is going so I heated
12:57 - messages named himself thought so when
13:01 - you guys load up it should ask you to
13:03 - input like a name Adam at some point but
13:07 - yeah let me know how this is going for
13:08 - you guys for me this seems to be working
13:09 - like okay obviously there's some bugs I
13:11 - got a tune out here oh hey Reb you thank
13:14 - you for the $1 super chat man appreciate
13:16 - that but yeah I mean we'll see if we can
13:21 - get this going
13:22 - and these seems like the naming thing
13:25 - seems to have some issues too
13:28 - yeah I was trying to add some castling
13:31 - in here as well after but I was getting
13:34 - some kind of issues with the castling so
13:36 - we'll see like if you guys try to castle
13:38 - and see if your castling works and let
13:40 - me know so I'm using a bun - I cannot
13:43 - resize window it's bigger on my laptop
13:45 - screen oh god sorry about that I can't
13:47 - really help you with that um well why
13:50 - wouldn't he take my that's an
13:52 - interesting decision ok let's take that
13:55 - I'm not very good at chess either by the
13:57 - way guys I don't know why I decided to
13:59 - create chess but I did
14:04 - let's see here okay how many guys have
14:06 - we got in here right now seven
14:08 - connections 71 games that's because
14:10 - we're not clearing games I'm just
14:11 - incrementing IDs of games when will you
14:14 - continue the tower game at some point
14:16 - I'll continue the tower game where's my
14:17 - pie game script my turn
14:19 - hmm okay so this is working for me guys
14:23 - let me know if this is working for you
14:24 - again people are gonna be leaving
14:25 - joining all that kind of stuff and
14:29 - showed it to review thank you for the
14:32 - super chat 5 bucks again loving your
14:34 - videos and helped me so much in my
14:35 - programming journey appreciate you mate
14:37 - thank you man I appreciate you that
14:39 - super chats awesome means a lot man
14:40 - thank you
14:41 - okay guys I'm gonna do I'm gonna start
14:43 - writing some more code so I apologize
14:45 - whoever I'm playing right now playing
14:47 - against right now I'm gonna write some
14:48 - code to hopefully fix the server a
14:50 - little bit but again I need you guys to
14:51 - let me know in the chat if it's working
14:53 - or if it's not because that's gonna be
14:55 - like that I need I need to know that
14:59 - otherwise this is not gonna go very well
15:01 - you guys need to tell me what's going
15:02 - wrong with all these videos try to
15:04 - castle as well because castling is like
15:06 - a huge thing that I was trying to work
15:08 - on earlier and I want to see if that's
15:10 - working if you don't know what castle is
15:13 - it's like when you switch the king with
15:14 - the rook and the way that I did is you
15:15 - have to click the rook to go to the king
15:17 - so what I want to do now is number of
15:22 - games should really just be equal to
15:24 - number of connections over to I don't
15:28 - even know I don't even think I could
15:29 - show the number of games running pickle
15:31 - Dada was truncated load key 8 server
15:34 - offline Oh God okay um pickle Dada was
15:39 - truncated that one's it I have to change
15:42 - that now take a look okay let's just do
15:46 - that
15:49 - um alright so for those of you that
15:51 - don't know how this works essentially I
15:54 - have these these are all my scripts okay
15:56 - and what happens is I have this server
15:58 - code running on this external linux
16:00 - server it is this one right here that
16:02 - you guys can see and it's handling all
16:05 - the connections in and out of this game
16:07 - now what it's doing is it's storing the
16:09 - games on the server and then it's
16:12 - sending those games like the data for
16:14 - those games to each player so what
16:17 - happens is when someone moves in one
16:18 - game it will move like in the other game
16:21 - that they're connected with now the
16:23 - issue that I'm having right now is
16:24 - having all these different games running
16:26 - at once I obviously haven't programmed
16:28 - the server to work well enough to do
16:30 - this so you can see like people just
16:32 - keep disconnecting and reconnecting but
16:35 - I was in a game and it was working fine
16:37 - for me so I mean I don't know what like
16:40 - is wrong with other people unless people
16:42 - just keep leaving immediately and
16:43 - playing against other people and if you
16:45 - want to post like formal issues code
16:47 - whatever on the issue page on the github
16:50 - then I can look on that as well and I'm
16:52 - gonna be updating that get up if I make
16:54 - changes to the code here so I just want
16:58 - to print the number of connections when
17:01 - people connect now and when people
17:04 - disconnect I'm - saying the connections
17:08 - let's see here oh okay so keeping track
17:13 - of the connections is something that I
17:14 - need to do better now - because if you
17:17 - for some reason like if you got this
17:20 - exception does it break when you get
17:23 - this exception no it doesn't break hmm
17:28 - hmm if not gaming games okay
17:36 - all right I think the server codes fine
17:38 - we're just gonna keep testing this
17:39 - running server with two connections we
17:41 - got two games going right now try to
17:43 - stay in the game if you guys can for
17:45 - like a fair amount of time just to test
17:48 - out if this is working now I have this
17:50 - spectator mode that I had implemented
17:52 - but for some reason the spectator mode
17:54 - wasn't working I'm gonna try to fix that
17:57 - and also this is the main game script
18:00 - and what I did at the top here is I did
18:03 - all this jazz so that if you don't have
18:06 - pip or you don't have PI game installed
18:08 - what happens is it automatically
18:10 - installs it for you so it just
18:12 - implements this thing there's actually a
18:13 - script called get pip and it has the
18:16 - bytecode for pip you can see it's like
18:18 - 21,000 lines or something and so you
18:21 - don't actually have to install pip
18:22 - because I have the actual pip in the
18:24 - file and then what happens is it imports
18:26 - that file and then it tries to use that
18:29 - to install pion how can I talk to it
18:32 - maybe working because you're running the
18:34 - server on your network no no the
18:35 - server's no guys this server is sorry
18:37 - this server is running on like an
18:40 - external server like this servers in
18:42 - like Lithuania or something I don't even
18:44 - know where it is but it's um it's not
18:46 - working it's not running on my network
18:47 - so you guys will be able to join the
18:49 - game and I can see like hey - left game
18:51 - J bros left game number of connections -
18:54 - number of games that should be changed
18:56 - I'm gonna restart the server guys
18:58 - because I just need to change one thing
19:01 - here and modify so we don't I don't get
19:07 - this weird game output anymore because
19:09 - that game output is not correct now I
19:12 - had this really cool spectator mode that
19:14 - I coded and it was working and then now
19:16 - it's not working so that's great but
19:18 - we'll see if I can get it to work I just
19:20 - want to comment out this comment save X
19:26 - okay so I'm gonna try to work on getting
19:29 - this what do you call it's the spectator
19:34 - mode to work from my end you guys just
19:36 - keep playing and let me know again if
19:37 - you have issues and we're just gonna
19:39 - peace through this and hopefully by the
19:40 - time we hit like in the next 10-15
19:41 - minutes everything will be working and I
19:43 - can just play against some of you guys
19:44 - and just chat with you on the live
19:46 - stream you if you guys are new here to
19:47 - join the game link in the description go
19:49 - to the
19:50 - Hubb I think I'd probably still have it
19:52 - up and there's instructions on how to
19:54 - get the game running on your thing you
19:56 - can skip step 1 as it should just
19:58 - install PI game for you automatically
20:00 - this is the repo and I haven't modified
20:03 - anything from the game end so it should
20:05 - just work for you guys now I'm gonna try
20:07 - to get the spectator thing working
20:08 - because for me it's having this
20:10 - spectator thing this spectator issue
20:13 - hey guys left game 7 hey Tim left game 8
20:18 - J Bros so guys oh you guys hate Tim J
20:21 - Bros 2 are you guys leaving the game or
20:22 - is it kicking you from the game that's
20:24 - something that I need to know and like
20:27 - connection reset by Pierre I don't know
20:28 - what issue that is there's a ton of
20:30 - stuff that I don't know so we have to
20:32 - see like if this is working or not J
20:35 - Bros I see you in the chat are you
20:37 - leaving the games or are you being
20:39 - kicked from the game and thank you for
20:41 - congratulations on 30 K um okay so let's
20:45 - upload update this file you guys can't
20:49 - know it's a nut so I'm gonna have to
20:51 - hide that C this year I'm just gonna
20:58 - have someone just send me a message on
20:59 - discord here so I'm just gonna have to
21:00 - grab this here so keep going guys I'm
21:08 - reading the chat if you have any
21:09 - questions let me know but if you have
21:11 - the errors please send them because we
21:12 - get we're just going through the
21:13 - debugging stage I know it's kind of
21:14 - boring right now but that's all we can
21:16 - really do until I figure out what these
21:19 - issues are but it does look to be
21:21 - working like fairly well to be quite
21:23 - honest with you so we'll see you know if
21:26 - we can get this going
21:30 - alright
21:32 - hey Tim left game eights number of
21:34 - connections for its kicking me kicked me
21:37 - out a game it's kicking me okay um how
21:41 - is it kicking you guys out of the game
21:42 - is it just randomly are you just
21:44 - randomly being kicked or what's going on
21:46 - is it like disconnect disconnect
21:49 - disconnect what would what will happen
21:53 - in some instances is you'll be kicked if
21:55 - the other player leaves so that could be
21:56 - the instance but you should see a
21:58 - message that says like you've you've
22:00 - been kicked from the game if once I get
22:02 - this spectator mode going I'll be able
22:04 - to do it a bit easier like looking
22:06 - through the games okay here a bunch of
22:08 - people just joined and a bunch of people
22:09 - got kicked connection reset player W
22:12 - wanting game 9 Xen burr left game 9 okay
22:16 - let me run a script here and let's see
22:17 - if we can get this going
22:18 - randomly kicked yeah um okay one second
22:23 - guys holy crap people are just
22:25 - disconnecting connecting left game 17
22:29 - player none left game 17 hmm okay let me
22:33 - print out the errors from the server
22:35 - side and then I'll try to fix some of
22:36 - them I'm just gonna restart the script
22:38 - guys sorry about that
22:41 - okay so server should be printing these
22:46 - exceptions so I have this try here if
22:50 - it's a server end issue it should just
22:52 - print them if it's not hmm let's see cuz
22:55 - when you disconnect that either men's
22:57 - means you left or it means that you know
22:59 - something happens so let's see here if
23:01 - not game okay let's run the server again
23:11 - okay - so it seems to work like at the
23:14 - beginning somewhat players end bar left
23:16 - game one right like I don't know if
23:18 - that's randomly kicking him or if he's
23:20 - joining in the game um let's see here
23:24 - let me get in the game here hmm so my
23:34 - spectator mode thing isn't working
23:35 - expected your luck game zero let's see
23:37 - if I can get this in here yeah I know
23:44 - it's giving me all this um spectator
23:47 - left game zero
23:48 - oh it's cuz it's okay that'd probably be
23:51 - why let's see your game yeah okay I'm
23:57 - gonna have to reset the server one more
23:58 - time guys sorry about that
24:01 - just delete that alright see if I can
24:13 - get in one here Tim okay there we go
24:17 - there turn I'm playing against this guy
24:19 - now let's see how long I can get this to
24:20 - go for and then I'll see what's going on
24:22 - with your guys games but for me when I
24:24 - do this it seems to be working fairly
24:27 - well to be honest for like my game end
24:30 - but I don't know also these times are
24:32 - messed up p1p2 so I oh this just changed
24:36 - hey Tim's time Zen bars game so the
24:41 - names are getting messed up that's it
24:42 - make a kickin tag on server I don't I
24:45 - don't randomly kick people that's the
24:47 - thing I don't know why people people are
24:49 - getting kicked out he's moving that okay
24:51 - so there's some latency issues here as
24:53 - well hmm okay but like I'm playing
24:57 - against someone here whoever's playing
24:58 - against me let me know
25:05 - if any of you guys are like successfully
25:08 - playing a game of chest against someone
25:09 - um let me know that and that would be
25:13 - helpful to know yeah see now I can't
25:15 - like I can't move right now
25:17 - it just seems frozen connection reset
25:23 - hey Tim's okay I'm gonna quit that and
25:27 - let him go if you want to quit the game
25:29 - it's better if you click Q to quit um
25:32 - hmm disconnect disconnect player to
25:35 - connection reset I don't know what this
25:37 - connection reset by peer means I'm gonna
25:38 - look that up okay keyboard interrupt
25:42 - let's run this again you guys can keep
25:44 - messing with that let me know the errors
25:46 - I'm gonna look up some stuff here
25:48 - connection reset by peer high amount of
25:53 - traffic okay so it may actually be a
25:57 - traffic issue that's that's causing this
25:59 - I'm just gonna make a modification in
26:02 - here and see if I can can fix this by
26:08 - just getting rid of I have like a timers
26:11 - yeah I don't know if that's gonna work I
26:16 - don't know if this is a traffic issue or
26:19 - what's wrong here I'm the winner tag on
26:22 - the server yeah okay
26:25 - connection reset by peer let's see air
26:28 - 404
26:47 - hmm seems a server-side limits the
26:53 - amount of requests per time out as a
26:55 - security issue you need to guess how
26:57 - many maybe using the script with a
26:58 - counter and adjust your script to
27:00 - surpass the limit okay so what the issue
27:02 - I'm having apparently and why you guys
27:03 - are getting kicked is because there's
27:06 - too much traffic going on right now
27:07 - there's too many games running at once
27:09 - which is something I anticipated so what
27:11 - I'm gonna need to do is just make it so
27:13 - that the refresh rate to the server is
27:15 - slower but that means that it's gonna be
27:17 - like whale a gear when you guys are
27:19 - running this so I'm gonna increase it um
27:21 - what you guys are gonna have to do is
27:23 - read download this github repo just
27:27 - redownload it and just run game 2 up
27:29 - high again I I just made the change
27:31 - so just redownload and try to it you can
27:33 - see like people are just getting holy
27:34 - crap
27:37 - Jesus okay umm redownload the repo I'm
27:41 - shutting the server down right now if
27:43 - you see you guys have a chance to do
27:44 - this and we'll see if this fixes it a
27:46 - little bit if it doesn't honestly I
27:48 - don't really know what's going on but I
27:49 - what I really want to get the spectator
27:52 - mode thing working so I wanted to go
27:53 - through and see this in my mind this was
27:54 - gonna work a lot smoother than it has
27:56 - but I mean you know not everything works
27:57 - perfectly
27:59 - I also need why not my ask you with the
28:01 - server on the web so the traffic's
28:03 - better no man I'm not gonna recode a
28:04 - server right now I'm just like messing
28:07 - with it as we speak games zero board
28:10 - okay so we need to get rid of this first
28:12 - of all okay so first thing we should do
28:17 - if connections modulus to equals it with
28:19 - zero current underscore game ID plus
28:22 - equals one game's current ID okay but
28:26 - then connections goes down with someone
28:28 - else joins which means current game ID
28:31 - hmm there's got to be a better way to
28:34 - connect people into games because what's
28:37 - happening is like someone will connect
28:38 - and someone will leave and the
28:39 - connections will be lower and then
28:40 - you're gonna get in a different game
28:42 - based on your connections which we don't
28:45 - want so create a new game know that
28:49 - current game ID plus equals 1 if
28:52 - connections by just 2 equals 0
28:56 - okay let's see here make a server
28:58 - handler for games yeah I have I have oh
29:00 - yeah print create new game I could do
29:02 - that but redownload that guy's for right
29:06 - now I'm gonna modify it on my end too
29:07 - and see if all I did is just add a timer
29:11 - essentially so that it doesn't it goes
29:13 - slower and when it's grabbing
29:16 - information which means it's gonna be
29:17 - kind of annoying but yeah you guys you
29:19 - guys will see how it works
29:21 - invalid game okay
29:24 - disconnect spectator left game that's
29:26 - spectator mode let's see an exception so
29:31 - if you leave while the peer is reset
29:38 - okay this does Python a private and
29:41 - public instances no I'm just trying to
29:46 - find a better way to assign people into
29:49 - games so that we keep hmm like you
29:55 - should really be deleting the old games
29:57 - keep so the current game ID is like that
30:00 - makes sense you add to the current game
30:03 - ID I can delete the other game which
30:08 - will kick someone out I don't know how
30:13 - exactly to go about doing this um let's
30:16 - see so what I had before I want to look
30:22 - at what I had before on the server
30:23 - actually let me go to the github and
30:24 - have a look at this and maybe I can just
30:27 - redownload that code and try again here
30:29 - from server okay let's go to chess game
30:33 - that's fine server okay so what I had
30:39 - essentially was let's see here oh no I
30:43 - didn't have the tries and except though
30:44 - if like for some reason something didn't
30:46 - work like you got disconnected it would
30:48 - delete that instance of the game which
30:51 - would cause the other person to get
30:52 - disconnected that worked for me when I
30:54 - just had like two or three people going
30:56 - at once so I don't know why it's not
30:59 - working now let's let me download this
31:03 - new
31:07 - cept exception okay and commit that all
31:23 - right I'm just gonna literally copy that
31:24 - it's got our raw okay we're gonna just
31:34 - try what I had last time again I said
31:37 - I'm gonna get rid of this address cuz I
31:39 - don't want you guys to see people's IP
31:42 - addresses new connection connection
31:47 - we'll get rid of this data as well
31:48 - because we don't actually we can print
31:50 - the line of games I think you need a
31:52 - lobby than a cube games yeah you'd be
31:54 - correct that I've put people into a
31:56 - lobby first and then IQ I just like
31:58 - right the plan of the car so you guys
32:00 - are aware the plan of this dream was not
32:02 - to write very much code at all like I
32:04 - was just planning on just releasing this
32:06 - and being like go play have fun
32:09 - I wasn't honestly expecting this many
32:12 - people to be playing so that's why maybe
32:16 - I can limit the amount of connections
32:18 - okay look I'm gonna try with the limit
32:21 - and it'll cue you like it'll if I do
32:24 - limit then it won't actually that'll
32:26 - just break you out okay let me try one
32:29 - let me try with the limit so if the
32:30 - connections I will only run like three
32:32 - games at once and see if I can get that
32:34 - working maybe let's see you know what
32:38 - let's just try this connections minus
32:41 - equals one really what's wrong with that
32:45 - that is except oh I forgot to comment
32:51 - out that and I don't need to go back in
32:53 - that nano watch a bit server
33:01 - okay let's try this yeah this is not
33:06 - going as smoothly as I was hoping
33:08 - okay someone's connected let's let's try
33:12 - this I'm really scared to keep running
33:13 - the server because then you guys just
33:15 - overload it like immediately I have it's
33:17 - a good server but I just I just my
33:18 - programming right there's nothing wrong
33:20 - with the server let's run a game it's
33:24 - gonna be I'm gonna be spectator mode
33:25 - right now aren't I
33:26 - oh there we go okay I'm playing against
33:29 - blue jays holy crap
33:38 - okay um so server's going down one more
33:44 - time
33:45 - I'm gonna fix it again I thought I
33:47 - remember that was the issue I ran into
33:48 - we're just gonna loop through the keys
33:50 - and just assign you into the next game
33:52 - if that doesn't work so say if G is less
33:57 - than all right if G not in games then
34:03 - we'll just add a new game so we'll say
34:05 - games say games and then zero was bored
34:17 - 8 comma 8 will do games G actually that
34:23 - should work should I be using a VPN no
34:27 - no you don't need a VPN I'm not stealing
34:28 - your IP don't worry um okay let's fix
34:31 - this No yeah whoever it's someone said
34:37 - in the chat cool idea brave project
34:40 - you're correct a very brave project I
34:42 - already had like I address already in
34:44 - use oh great that's gonna be an issue
34:46 - yeah you guys can see here like this is
34:49 - what the server is that's 8 as 8 cores
34:52 - tasks to 37 through 1 running ok let's
34:55 - let's close out any Python tasks I have
34:58 - right now I feel like the firewall on
35:04 - the server might be blocking all these
35:07 - connections back that's a very possible
35:11 - issue I'm just gonna monitor this server
35:13 - tab you guys go ahead and try to connect
35:15 - her
35:15 - we got one connection let's see what's
35:17 - going on
35:24 - alright guys try to connect I want to
35:27 - see if I can get this going or not we
35:30 - got one connection right now let me run
35:34 - one no I forgot I have two connection
35:40 - reset by peer Connect connect holy crap
35:52 - disconnect player none left game 0
35:55 - number connections to so works with 2
35:57 - games what happens when we have three
35:59 - games because right now there's two
36:00 - games running and I don't see any issues
36:02 - with three connections so it means
36:05 - someone's waiting to queue for game so
36:07 - if I try to go in now and now it's just
36:12 - work anymore oh wait okay your block
36:17 - their turn okay I'm playing against
36:19 - someone see if they can move like I
36:22 - don't seem to get kicked right away when
36:24 - I do this but a lot of people seem to
36:27 - just be like instantly being
36:28 - disconnected oh now I'm playing against
36:32 - someone else so what's actually
36:34 - happening here is other people are
36:38 - joining my game like when someone leaves
36:41 - this game someone else actually gets put
36:43 - into this game which is not obviously
36:45 - what you want what you want when someone
36:46 - leaves it it deletes that game um so you
36:49 - get kicked you can see this is this
36:51 - guy's turn he's not going so I'm just
36:52 - gonna quit and then play again um see if
36:57 - I can get in a game here I've had a few
37:01 - decent ones going waiting for player so
37:04 - that's me I'm the third connection see
37:06 - if someone else comes in here and see if
37:09 - this works
37:09 - um yeah trace my module named name era
37:16 - name Jake is not to find
37:26 - so someone else left
37:28 - ok guys someone joint okay now it's my
37:29 - turn all right sweet I'm playing against
37:31 - someone playing against bluejay this
37:33 - guy's can shout out to bluejay
37:34 - he has consistently been joining these
37:36 - games I've seen him in it like all the
37:38 - time do this ok so I'm playing I'm
37:41 - playing a civil game of chess right now
37:42 - and this seems to be working and this is
37:47 - against again one of the viewers right
37:48 - now blue jay and nothing's going on with
37:51 - our game like at least that I'm noticing
37:54 - there's nothing happening so we'll see
37:58 - here you have to put your name in
38:01 - quotations no you don't have to put your
38:02 - name the quotation your name should just
38:03 - be like text if you type numbers and
38:05 - stuff you might like run into an issue
38:06 - Oh connection so bluej either left that
38:13 - hmm connection reset by pierre blur none
38:17 - left game to get guys options right now
38:21 - we can keep I can keep trying I can set
38:23 - a limit on the amount of connections and
38:25 - see if that fixes things like just set
38:27 - it some max like 10 games running at
38:29 - once or something like that or I can try
38:32 - to program to fix it so infinite people
38:35 - can connect you guys can let me know
38:37 - what you want to see in the stream again
38:39 - I'm just doing this for fun I want to
38:40 - chat with some of you guys I'm not
38:41 - really too bothered that it's not
38:42 - working as well as I was hoping it would
38:44 - because I kind of expected that to be
38:46 - honest with you but um again you guys
38:49 - have to let me know what you want to see
38:51 - from that number of games oh ok let's
38:57 - get rid of this spectator thing the
39:01 - spectator of code is just not working if
39:03 - G not in games games G or what I think I
39:07 - should do is loop through all the games
39:10 - see if they're ready and if they're not
39:12 - ready then just put that player in the
39:15 - game so maybe that's what I'll do to
39:16 - determine the games so we don't get
39:18 - these weird connection issues so yeah ok
39:22 - so let's try that so let's say for game
39:25 - and games
39:27 - keys
39:31 - if game I guess oh it's gonna be keys
39:36 - will say if games game dot ready equals
39:42 - it goes false then we'll just throw
39:44 - someone in that game so I'll just say
39:45 - game say G equals game um
39:50 - with this new bytes object has no
39:53 - attribute ready oh that would have not
39:55 - unpick olden time holy crap okay I
40:00 - didn't miss any Super chats here tonight
40:02 - cuz someone gave me oh it's okay says I
40:04 - have eight dollars in revenue but it's
40:05 - because of its like us to get to
40:08 - Canadian conversion alright let me rerun
40:11 - the server guys again I apologize for
40:13 - all this mess I really wish this was
40:14 - working a bit better but you know we'll
40:16 - see server let's see if I can get this
40:18 - going now override okay so by the way in
40:24 - case you're confused this is win SCP or
40:27 - something which is just allowing me to
40:30 - FTP to the server so that I don't have
40:31 - to like do like I don't know edit the
40:34 - code on the server could you not compile
40:37 - this into an exe I could but I'd like
40:39 - then I'd have to you guys I'd have to
40:41 - keep working with stuff so just easier
40:42 - to do this okay let's try this now I'm
40:44 - game
40:45 - Tim connect all right waiting for player
40:51 - player B 1 in game 0 so I mean someone
40:54 - quits hey Tim left game 0 okay I'm
40:59 - waiting for someone enjoy my game right
41:00 - now there we go
41:02 - in so someone joined they got put in my
41:04 - game that's blue J sweet let's run it
41:08 - I've been playing against this guy like
41:10 - the whole time this is this is funny
41:13 - alright connection reset by peer I can't
41:19 - I don't know how to fix that issue so if
41:22 - the connection resets like how do you
41:26 - get a too much traffic to the socket
41:29 - holy
41:31 - I could set a time so there's too much
41:37 - traffic that's the issue I'm too much
41:39 - traffic on the server that's that's what
41:41 - we've figured out is the issue so it's
41:43 - working sometimes but then we just get
41:44 - randomly kicked because there's too much
41:46 - traffic all right so let's say socket
41:48 - Python too much traffic let's see if I
41:56 - can fix that you guys can keep messing
41:57 - with it what is the name cache when you
42:00 - set by peer it's fatal the remote server
42:02 - has sent you an rst packet which
42:04 - indicates an immediate dropping in the
42:05 - connection this means is disconnect
42:16 - connect yeah so connection reset by peer
42:18 - is the issue
42:27 - oh I can raise the socket time out issue
42:30 - okay let's try that and then that way
42:33 - okay socket time out raise Python let's
42:43 - see here that's all I want to raise that
42:48 - okay I want to raise the socket time out
42:50 - let's see this so you got eliminate yeah
42:52 - I have to limit like how this is low
42:54 - level networking socket how to catch
42:56 - socket time out set default timeout let
43:07 - me see what sockets default timeout is
43:08 - and then set it higher default timeout
43:13 - Python so what I've determined is
43:15 - happening I don't know if this is
43:16 - correct or not is um that it just
43:20 - there's so much traffic then it's not
43:22 - sending back in time and then it's just
43:25 - dropping the connection be the same well
43:26 - you cannot connecting I'm just gonna
43:27 - disconnect so I want to raise that
43:29 - socket timeout if so if I can do that
43:33 - then hopefully this will be work better
43:35 - timeout
43:37 - curses socket timeout okay so subclass
43:41 - socket time a note I don't know what the
43:44 - default socket timeout is I don't know
43:46 - what the thing is that it takes set
43:48 - timeout value set a time and I'm
43:53 - blocking socket operations the value may
43:55 - be non-native floating-point number
43:56 - expressed seconds okay so if that's
43:59 - seconds then let's just set that timeout
44:01 - to like five seconds and five seconds
44:05 - should be plenty of time for that at it
44:11 - socket default timeout five okay so
44:17 - let's run that now and see if I gets to
44:21 - work almost work install pie game for
44:24 - the impressive stuff man yeah then the
44:26 - script that I wrote to install pie game
44:28 - was um I was pretty impressed by that to
44:31 - be quite honest with you guys I'd show
44:32 - you one but like it just makes sure that
44:34 - if you have don't have pie game it
44:35 - automatically I'm oh god it's still not
44:38 - working very well if you're wondering
44:42 - what I'm doing I'm just pouring water
44:43 - into my mug um connect/disconnect Game
44:48 - one ended connections okay uh Pierre
45:00 - okay I don't think it's working guys
45:05 - let's see this server offline try again
45:15 - yeah yeah yeah that's yeah um kierra
45:22 - zero Pierre Pierre here connection reset
45:26 - Pierre so I need to handle that key err
45:29 - what line is that happening on 49 from
45:33 - threaded client
45:38 - oh hey Terry how you doing um okay so
45:42 - let's let's fix that Keir now so I'm
45:48 - getting this I mean this Kiera four
45:53 - games game which means a game clearly
45:56 - it's just not but that it should be a
45:57 - key cuz for game and game stock keys if
46:00 - games game got ready equals equals false
46:03 - G equals game past game that should just
46:06 - work that's not working we need to just
46:10 - try accept that done um
46:13 - bo games games try except when you don't
46:21 - know what to do just put in a try and
46:22 - accept just break that um alright let's
46:31 - try this print error game does not exist
46:42 - maybe we might have to do a like part
46:44 - two to the stream where Tim actually
46:46 - like fixes this and makes it work
46:48 - properly I thought the most common issue
46:50 - was just the timeout issue which I
46:52 - thought I could fix by just setting it
46:54 - bigger but also I'm wondering now where
46:57 - are most of you guys that are connecting
46:59 - let me know in the chat like are you
47:00 - guys in India are you in like Canada are
47:03 - you in Europe because that's probably
47:05 - gonna influence how this works with the
47:08 - timeout issue yeah that's probably gonna
47:12 - have some effect on the timeout again I
47:15 - don't know but let's break outside oh my
47:19 - god okay you fixed that break how do I
47:24 - do this is past
47:27 - okay so if that's the issue then bo
47:32 - games game let's just pick one that's do
47:38 - we use game any rails game if game not
47:41 - in games break so it should do that here
47:45 - Bo games game Bo to start user Bo games
47:49 - game so it'll just it's just crashes I
47:52 - okay try I don't know what's wrong with
47:58 - this I'm in Canada I'm in u.s. sorry wow
48:01 - I'm in I'm in Brazil you drink water
48:04 - from mug yes I do Ottawa sweet okay so
48:06 - we got people from all over USA
48:08 - Indonesia yeah I don't know I don't
48:13 - really know what the issue is to be
48:14 - honest I think it's also a thing like
48:16 - I'm sending a crazy amount of bytes like
48:19 - a lot of information like you can see
48:21 - this is how much it's sending every time
48:23 - so that could be an issue too maybe I'd
48:26 - like at some point you know I can have a
48:28 - look at this when I'm more focused not
48:30 - on stream and try to fix this um we'll
48:34 - keep going with it though okay so
48:36 - connections plus equal one con dot send
48:38 - out a string vo equals games game that
48:43 - doesn't work let's just pick another
48:45 - game so we already have the script to do
48:48 - that
48:48 - so if games game dot ready okay let's
48:55 - try this
49:01 - let's say bo equals games game check
49:08 - Instagram DM great proposition Tim
49:10 - alright let's check well I'll check
49:12 - through my stuff in a second guys okay
49:14 - let's try to run this again I know the
49:15 - server's offline right now so you guys
49:17 - won't be seeing anything
49:17 - I'm server yes but like this works for
49:23 - two-player I might just max the
49:25 - connections at two and play against some
49:27 - of you guys and like if this doesn't
49:28 - work if you guys are interested in doing
49:30 - that let me know or maybe make it like
49:32 - two games running at once and then
49:34 - hopefully that can like make things a
49:35 - bit better cuz again I don't really know
49:38 - what's going wrong with this Tim yeah
49:41 - it's hilarious the second that I start
49:43 - it like a ton of people join in so I
49:45 - know you guys are just like waiting to
49:46 - queue in the game when was this I hear
49:49 - new connections who's keeps naming
49:52 - themself hi Tim okay I'm playing now
49:55 - against someone see how long this can
49:58 - see how long this works I'm playing
50:01 - against blue Jeff why I always play
50:03 - against blue J I think it just me Blue
50:06 - Jay left game hey Tim left game
50:10 - connection reset by Pierre I still I
50:14 - don't get I'm from Greece I still cannot
50:16 - connect oh so I tried ping server's IP
50:17 - and has a hundred milliseconds latency
50:19 - is not too long maybe some thing other
50:21 - is the problem
50:23 - Poland dude yeah you're
50:27 - Bo reference before assignment that's an
50:32 - issue game does not exist okay let's try
50:35 - this again try accept print err game
50:43 - does not exist okay let's not do that
50:46 - just go and so pass well vo equals games
50:50 - games Bo is here though so this should
50:52 - be fun um you know reference before
50:57 - assignment where's that issue be able to
51:01 - start user current ID line sixty-three
51:03 - that shouldn't be an issue should have
51:06 - Bo should be defined Oh if so otherwise
51:10 - so you say if you notice it Bo equals
51:14 - none if not Bo then create a new game
51:21 - some will say I need to global current
51:26 - game I will just do it by connections I
51:28 - guess we'll just create a new game set
51:31 - games connection over to hmm okay I'm
51:40 - gonna leave this running you guys can
51:41 - still try messing with it I think I'm
51:43 - just gonna focus dial in here and try to
51:45 - fix this with this it just it has to be
51:48 - something with just the game queuing and
51:49 - just something like that unless people
51:51 - are quitting from like the client side
51:53 - but I don't think there's something
51:54 - wrong with the client side and if there
51:55 - was then it should be spitting out the
51:57 - error to you guys when the game crashes
51:59 - so if you see those errors let me know
52:00 - but um let's just try to get this
52:02 - working if try bo games game so I want
52:07 - to have a unique ID for each game but
52:10 - I'm doing it based on connections but I
52:12 - can't do it based on connections because
52:14 - if I do it based on connections then it
52:17 - just like that doesn't work okay so
52:21 - deleting games try Dell games games
52:27 - connections - it was one game game ended
52:30 - disconnected player
52:33 - okay that should work get rid of this
52:37 - say Pio eCos games games
52:39 - I got a 56 number a few times and
52:48 - running it oh my I don't even know
52:49 - what's up at that I'll run the game side
52:51 - and see what's up about to you it's
52:54 - funny because this works so well like
52:56 - I've run I'd had like four games running
52:58 - um like on my computer and like my
53:00 - brother's computer and they was working
53:01 - fine but now it's just not working at
53:04 - all
53:04 - let's just do this let's not go based on
53:08 - connections what I think I'm gonna do is
53:11 - just loop through all the games that
53:12 - exist see if first of all those get
53:16 - whole hmm I could just set rather than
53:22 - creating all these new games I could
53:24 - just set like five games have people
53:27 - join I don't know if want to do that
53:29 - either so many different ways to
53:30 - possibly do this if connections modules
53:32 - to equals equals zero games connections
53:35 - over to or eight I don't think I'm even
53:40 - I think I'm just gonna loop through and
53:41 - see if there's any games that aren't
53:43 - ready yet
53:43 - ABB's someone into that game and if
53:46 - there's no games then just create a new
53:48 - one okay so for game and game dog keys
53:52 - if game game to already equals false G
53:54 - equals game okay perfect
53:56 - will say if I will just say G equals
53:58 - negative one here if G equals negative
54:03 - one then we'll say games zero equals and
54:09 - in this case games not ready
54:14 - game zero but how are we ever gonna have
54:17 - game one then G equals equals negative
54:20 - one games and then lists games dot keys
54:31 - plus one game Ducky's negative one plus
54:36 - one equals board eighty I also ran out
54:42 - of input ran on input by subjects not
54:44 - you ready server offline what does that
54:46 - mean
54:47 - it's what I've got in CMD David that
54:50 - means that like you received a bytes
54:52 - object it did an unpick 'el and then the
54:55 - server offline so just like something
54:56 - happened with the server there I know
54:58 - the issue but it's kind of hard to like
54:59 - explain how that works we're getting
55:01 - this this issue with bo2 saying local
55:05 - variable Bo reference for assignment
55:07 - which means that the try/except up here
55:10 - wasn't working properly so Bo goos games
55:12 - if not spec okay Pio goes games game
55:18 - that should just always work if that
55:22 - doesn't then we should just quit the
55:23 - threaded client um pickled Dada was
55:25 - truncated pickled Dada was truncated you
55:31 - shouldn't be getting pickled data
55:33 - truncated I really tried so hard to fix
55:35 - that issue okay let's try this again
55:39 - okay let's send more data I don't think
55:42 - it's a timeout anymore I used to think
55:43 - it was the timeout let's receive this
55:45 - times eight so we don't get truncated
55:48 - pickled Dada anymore and let's see if
55:53 - the server runs a bit better now if we
55:55 - get multiple games going so say for game
55:57 - and game about keys there's nothing I
55:58 - won't do anything obviously so if G
56:00 - equals negative one games list games dog
56:05 - keys negative 1 which is the n plus one
56:09 - he was bored eight eight and then just
56:12 - say me equals madness
56:17 - so gee who's that and then G hates
56:24 - anyone who's new if you guys want to try
56:25 - this out I'm just having some issues
56:27 - getting a server running properly
56:29 - probably go for like another hour
56:30 - something we'll see you know how this
56:34 - works number of connections number of
56:38 - games equals the land of games that
56:40 - should be correct actually should delete
56:42 - game when you leave I almost want to max
56:46 - it to for connections and just say don't
56:48 - accept the connect in case so I'm gonna
56:50 - max the four connections or now I'm
56:51 - gonna say if connections is less than
56:54 - four otherwise break and we'll see it
56:59 - like I'll slowly increment what do you
57:03 - do it I'll slowly increment the amount
57:06 - of games that we have and then you know
57:10 - we'll see how this goes so we'll start
57:13 - with four and then we'll go up from
57:16 - there okay so let me go server yes okay
57:24 - let's run this now invalid syntax yep
57:30 - really okay yeah no server doc hi
57:35 - actually I don't want to edit it like
57:36 - that spend it here server it up high so
57:43 - equal isn't equal equals such a silly
57:48 - mistake that's fine I better fix that in
57:51 - here too so I forget if G equals equals
57:53 - negative one run that no run that okay
57:59 - connections first for people get in the
58:01 - game go list index out of range
58:11 - new fix one second this is actually easy
58:14 - fix
58:15 - I can't believe I didn't think of that
58:16 - um try because there's obviously gonna
58:22 - be no games so you have to create a new
58:24 - one
58:25 - except game 0 equals board so say G is
58:29 - zero games equals board okay try that
58:34 - now this is so stressful because usually
58:38 - I can just test it on my own computer
58:39 - and then like if it doesn't work it's
58:41 - just an issue for me but you guys are
58:42 - all like trying to connect constantly so
58:44 - we like I can get as frustrating for you
58:45 - guys especially because you're just
58:46 - trying to help me out
58:47 - ah all right I gotta be fast yeah
58:50 - otherwise I'm not even gonna get in the
58:51 - game get game Tim
58:56 - server offline if address already in use
59:00 - that that's an issue H top
59:04 - whoever's told me to do it concurrently
59:05 - um that's it that's a problem for
59:09 - another day
59:15 - what is this network manager thing doing
59:18 - I don't know what that's doing I don't
59:22 - think I have any more Python processes
59:24 - running should be at the top if they are
59:27 - oh people just like instantly connect
59:34 - server offline oh I'm not even gonna get
59:37 - in connection reset by Pierre let's see
59:40 - this Tim your block their turn okay
59:48 - what happened here it just stopped
59:51 - running oh my god I'm an idiot so what I
59:59 - did
59:59 - oh no this is that yeah don't do that
60:06 - yeah that's just yeah I essentially made
60:10 - it so once a hits for connection service
60:11 - stops running I don't you don't want
60:14 - that uh me Gayle fishing was ok it was
60:17 - kind of cold but you know it was alright
60:19 - connection reset can actually set it can
60:21 - actually reset connection number of
60:22 - connections three number of connections
60:24 - I want to reach for connections and then
60:26 - that way we can just like chill Johnny
60:28 - left game one come on Johnny
60:30 - Tim your block there turn all right for
60:35 - connections if no one leaves then you
60:37 - should be okay we should see if this
60:39 - works
60:40 - FIFA lover I'm doing good man how are
60:42 - you doing alright
60:44 - come on man let's go Zinberg it's your
60:46 - turn if you don't go see what I'm gonna
60:48 - have to quit okay there we go
60:50 - alright I'm gonna play a casual game of
60:53 - chess if you guys have any questions you
60:54 - just want to chat ask me anything feel
60:56 - free in the chat if you have any tips
60:59 - what I like if this works with four
61:01 - games then we've kind of fixed some of
61:05 - the stuff oh he's going Queen out
61:06 - alright
61:13 - I'm waiting to see if it tells me that I
61:15 - left 'game okay so let's go like hmm I
61:21 - also like very bad at chess so this is
61:23 - gonna be an interesting game I want to
61:24 - protect that pawn you guys have any

61:54 - everything else is having I'm gonna get
61:56 - my music going quickly here you're still
62:01 - watching yes I am knew he's gonna take
62:06 - that this guy's killing me right now
62:12 - this is your old chess game this is my
62:14 - old chess game this is my old chess game
62:16 - faithful lover I wasn't connected when
62:19 - it said I disconnected Oh God this is
62:22 - just okay this game is working though
62:24 - like I'm playing a nice game of chess
62:25 - against this guy although he's
62:32 - absolutely like mopping the floor with
62:34 - me but I mean other than that
62:37 - nice civil game
62:44 - also guys I'm working on this really
62:47 - cool machine learning model it's uh it's
62:50 - a chat bot that talks like me I've got
62:54 - it like kind of working like there's so
62:56 - much more I need to do with it but like
62:57 - it's really it's pretty exciting so if
62:58 - you guys are excited about that let me
63:00 - know I'm planning like what I'm doing is
63:02 - I trained it off all my previous
63:03 - iMessage history and I got all my
63:06 - responses like any given text and I
63:09 - forgot that you can go diagonal oh my
63:12 - god this guy's killing me um I Jesus
63:17 - can't go there do this sorry I got
63:19 - distracted off train it off all my
63:21 - iMessage history and then um what did I
63:26 - do from there sure we got the like
63:28 - responses based on what I've said oh my
63:31 - god this guy's killing I can't focus
63:32 - when I'm getting destroyed in chests now
63:35 - he's gonna take my rook isn't he
63:38 - let's see and right now I'm just working
63:42 - on the model that essentially can like
63:43 - take any string of text and give you a
63:47 - response that sounds like me but it's
63:48 - pretty interesting it's actually like I
63:50 - don't know he's kind of blowing my mind
63:51 - how it actually works
63:53 - I've been following like a few tutorials
63:54 - online on how to figure it out this this
63:59 - video will be saved so you guys can look
64:01 - at it it's kind of just been a mess I've
64:03 - just been trying to figure stuff out and
64:04 - get people connected a few people I
64:06 - think we're playing games but I don't
64:08 - really know I don't know if someone else
64:11 - is playing a game currently I don't know
64:14 - if that's happening all I know is I'm
64:16 - getting killed in this game of chess and
64:17 - it just not is not going great I really
64:19 - wanted to try castling but then he kind
64:21 - of ruined my approach on that alright we
64:26 - got a piece there now he's gonna take it
64:28 - with the rook looks like that one black
64:31 - mirror episode yeah it works okay so his
64:34 - in bars playing against me yeah so I
64:36 - don't know you guys were all saying it
64:37 - wasn't working but as soon as I start
64:39 - playing it works for me and it's nothing
64:40 - to do with my network so I don't know
64:43 - hmm
64:45 - it's coming in a bit of a pickle right
64:48 - here
64:50 - is not really much way to catch up
64:53 - could you guys would think I'd be good
64:59 - at chess but I'm really it's just I'm
65:00 - really just not I'm definitely gonna
65:02 - play around with the server stuff I've
65:04 - seen it done foreign python so thanks
65:05 - man no worries got ya the end of the day
65:07 - you know if it doesn't work you can just
65:09 - steal the code I have on github it's
65:10 - completely open-source right and try to
65:13 - mess with it there what is he going for
65:15 - here
65:16 - Oh
65:19 - Zen bar left the game I don't know if he
65:22 - left or or not if we ran into an issue
65:24 - so yeah that's a question okay guys try
65:29 - to connect see if you can get your games
65:31 - running I'm gonna bump the games up to
65:33 - like six I think so that more people can
65:35 - connect so I'm gonna quit that now and
65:38 - then yeah let's just we'll keep bumping
65:41 - up and see if we get this working
65:42 - properly six I feel like I should be
65:46 - printing out like what game it's putting
65:47 - you in what game it's not putting in but
65:50 - again we don't really not that advanced
65:52 - here um okay so let's go server yes how
65:59 - old do you Tim I'm 18 guys I do really
66:02 - apologize to a lot of you guys I
66:03 - appreciate the help and everyone's
66:05 - joining in and trying to mess with this
66:06 - I think it's kind of fun but I mean like
66:08 - it's also kind of annoying because you
66:09 - want it I want to get working a little
66:11 - bit better but at the end of the day um
66:14 - I'm not left the game oh great so you
66:20 - had block it's their turn I'm playing
66:21 - against player - I don't know whoever
66:23 - that is he must not know type 2 naman
66:26 - Oh connection reset player non left the
66:33 - game player hey Tim left the game left
66:36 - the game left the game hmm I'm gonna try
66:41 - castle because I haven't done that yet
66:43 - that'll be our test currently
66:54 - add a listener for an input let's see oh
67:02 - great
67:03 - he knows I'm trying to Castle cuz he's
67:05 - listening to what I'm saying maybe that
67:08 - other way
67:09 - I remember reading somewhere like the
67:14 - rules of chess like in your opening you
67:16 - never want to move the same piece twice
67:17 - or something like that and I've just
67:19 - violated that rule a bunch of times man
67:20 - really you're not gonna let me Castle I
67:22 - just want to test my castling let's do
67:25 - that
67:26 - so now I'm kind of screwed because he
67:28 - has all these pieces advanced up the
67:30 - board but you know I don't this would be
67:34 - good if I was actually like a decent
67:35 - chess player other player left so again
67:37 - I don't oh there's something I got an
67:40 - error that popped up there let's read
67:42 - that err I mean I'm gonna run this with
67:45 - IDL II and try to play and see like what
67:47 - errors I get one if I disconnect an
67:51 - invalid argument was supplied oh I'm not
67:54 - running server sir why am i running
67:55 - server one run game
67:58 - no edit with ideally five Tim let's get
68:08 - this PI game window open all right
68:11 - waiting for player let's see the next
68:13 - person to successfully connect to the
68:15 - server is going to be yeah was early
68:21 - planning on making this stream like go
68:23 - for a long time if I was I would I trot
68:27 - like attempt to fix all these issues
68:28 - obviously but again I just don't really
68:30 - know like what is going on there's
68:31 - issues on the server side there's issues
68:33 - on the client side just a lot of stuff
68:35 - and apparently okay now I'm in so I'm
68:37 - playing at Blue Jay then playing against
68:38 - this guy like the whole time I just want
68:40 - to have this ideally window open so I
68:42 - can actually see what the air is when
68:44 - when I get one so I'm just gonna keep
68:46 - testing this will keep going just kind
68:48 - of play with it um what else you guys
68:52 - saying here all right
68:57 - I'm so bad at chess I don't know have
68:59 - any idea what made us to actually make
69:04 - if you guys haven't seen my other
69:06 - livestream by the way I did what was it
69:09 - like a 12 hour coding one where actually
69:11 - went for 12 hours this time and I did
69:13 - the tower defense game so that one's
69:15 - cool okay so ran outta input bytes
69:19 - objects has so much we already failed
69:21 - server offline ran Oh to input that is
69:24 - actually a easier fix okay so we can fix
69:27 - that one ran out of input so if you guys
69:29 - we're getting ran out of input as like a
69:31 - main issue I can fix that
69:35 - actually what is ran out of input err
69:43 - Python what is that getting this I would
69:50 - check the file is not empty first most
69:55 - of the answers here I've dealt with how
69:56 - to manage EOF error exceptions which is
69:59 - really handy if you're unsure but
70:00 - whether the pickled object is empty or
70:01 - not however if you're surprised pickle
70:03 - if I was empty okay so the pickle file
70:10 - is empty that it's sending to me which
70:13 - means it wouldn't have been dumped from
70:15 - the server properly or it just like
70:18 - didn't receive anything from the server
70:20 - so it was empty when I was opening it
70:22 - okay let's try to mess with that server
70:27 - okay connection closed they'll print
70:34 - e.honda
70:35 - send all send data it goes pickled dumb
70:41 - Bo okay is that always happening if not
70:46 - d break so it should just be dumping
70:51 - this this pic object every time but I
70:54 - guess if Bo isn't defined but it should
70:57 - be
71:00 - so I don't know why that would be it so
71:02 - in the client error here pickled out
71:06 - loads reply let's try to make this eight
71:14 - yeah I don't know why that's doing that
71:16 - I don't know why I'm getting that except
71:23 - socket air as II trying to apply pickles
71:28 - ran out of input hmm where was I looking
71:32 - at up okay let's see
71:49 - pickle ran on input easy solutions to
71:54 - prefix each message with the length the
71:56 - problem with your code is that receive
71:57 - when you cease to be saga my return
71:59 - different amounts of data from what you
72:00 - might have expect and their slice type
72:02 - packet boundaries so the easy solution
72:03 - is prefect each message then for
72:06 - receiving okay
72:14 - for receiving everything the server
72:16 - sends until it closes its side of the
72:18 - connection try this socket dot send all
72:22 - okay and then start server at address so
72:36 - yeah I don't know why I'm getting that
72:38 - issue you guys were saying you were
72:39 - getting that issue a lot - um yeah I
72:42 - don't know that's it I wonder earn you
72:44 - guys playing right now says something
72:46 - says some games ago I player Jake left
72:48 - game one game one ended I think the game
72:50 - aspect is working but I think what just
72:52 - happening is it's it's just crashing on
72:54 - on this the client-side so I think I've
72:56 - honestly figured out because I don't get
72:58 - these like these happen to once in a
72:59 - while but that's not I don't know that's
73:01 - expected so I think what I need to do
73:03 - now is just mess with the client-side
73:04 - and see if there's a way that it you
73:06 - know it could keep trying rather than
73:09 - just doing this this issue here so we'll
73:13 - send that same data we'll just say like
73:15 - wow should we try it like I just want to
73:19 - set a timer essentially okay so let's
73:23 - import time this is gonna require that
73:25 - you guys read download this after so
73:28 - I'll tell you that after that's probably
73:29 - an issue to you guys are using like
73:31 - different versions of everything okay
73:32 - anyways we'll print E and I will say try
73:37 - or say start time this time that time
73:47 - we'll say Wow time that time - start
73:55 - others where time is less than and we'll
73:58 - do well give it like a 10-second doing
74:02 - this a long time we'll give it a five
74:03 - second time out so it waits five seconds
74:05 - to try to get another response if it
74:06 - doesn't get one in that time it will
74:07 - just break um so then what we'll do is
74:10 - just keep trying to do this so we'll
74:12 - keep if pick okay let's try this
74:15 - keep trying this so I could just do like
74:26 - a Wow let's put the whole thing in a
74:29 - while with whatever I'm trying to do
74:30 - here let's just put it in a while loop
74:31 - with it this time then start time while
74:42 - true and we'll say if reply okay so if
74:49 - we get here then we just break this
74:50 - wallet if we get to the point where we
74:53 - can return reply then break say well
74:58 - I'll just return anyway so we don't even
74:59 - need to break it'll just keep trying it
75:01 - but we need to do that time aspect let's
75:04 - do the hot so say time time - start
75:09 - underscore time okay I don't know if
75:13 - there's any way that I can block people
75:15 - from joining because I want to just try
75:17 - it on my end and see if this works okay
75:18 - I'm gonna stop that connection
75:20 - um Python equals Java they are both to
75:25 - me the same know Python Java are very
75:27 - different
75:27 - okay I first update a few things I think
75:30 - I'm just gonna just throw this code
75:33 - other player left
75:35 - so what's that exception where it says
75:37 - like failed Oh failed just means it it
75:41 - broke that while loop skipper to that
75:48 - try accept and screen break print
75:52 - exception where else is this break
75:55 - sometimes printer please type your name
76:10 - no I can't do that okay so I'm gonna
76:14 - upload this code to github you guys
76:16 - gonna have to read download it I'm gonna
76:19 - change the server here to what it is on
76:22 - my computer now I got to deal with all
76:25 - these different versions just a master
76:26 - cap you read that go to github let's go
76:34 - code update files so once I changed
76:39 - water client and game server as well
77:06 - okay everyone go to the github
77:09 - redownload this code I just updated some
77:12 - stuff I don't like
77:13 - who knows is it gonna work I have no
77:15 - idea we'll see and try that okay we're
77:18 - gonna we're gonna mess with that now and
77:20 - see if we can get that going
77:22 - I just put in the chat too because that
77:23 - was gonna happen sooner I'm waiting for
77:25 - all these connections now to come in so
77:27 - this is let's see this if you try to
77:28 - connect with the other one it still
77:29 - might work but again okay I'm gonna have
77:36 - to update the code on github again I'm
77:37 - I've apologized I should tested this
77:39 - first Tim sir offline
77:45 - what's the issue started connection new
77:50 - connection what's you get says you guys
77:54 - are in though Tim but I can't join
77:59 - server offline why is that happening
78:06 - games you ended number connections one
78:08 - actually reset or any this it's not
78:10 - working is it guys I don't know what the
78:12 - hell what the heck is happening there's
78:14 - nothing I don't think anything is
78:15 - happening on server I think it's just
78:16 - literally not oh the reply might be oh
78:26 - yeah I know what I did wrong
78:32 - oh god okay let's go to network client
78:34 - up I just everyone's like it's broken
78:38 - its broken okay let's see um well time
78:44 - that time is less than five I apologize
78:59 - go redownload again guys I changed it
79:02 - that's yeah that's yeah oh my god okay
79:07 - i'ma modify that when I mind now ideally
79:11 - I dis just yeah that would be why I
79:13 - wasn't working I was like why the heck
79:15 - is this going now it should work uh
79:17 - what's running the wrong thing you're
79:20 - gonna have to go download again guys
79:22 - from the thing I apologize see this
79:27 - still not working oh my god I don't know
79:30 - what the issue is edit with ideally
79:40 - server offline okay let's try this yeah
79:48 - I pulled just for all the mistakes yeah
79:49 - I don't know this is kind of fun to mess
79:50 - around with it but like this is breaking
79:54 - when it shouldn't be actually sleeping
79:57 - and break okay if Ronnie befall Bo
80:04 - equals connect so it's gotta be
80:06 - something here that's messing up print
80:15 - okay I'm just gonna turn the server
80:17 - offline so I don't mess with you guys
80:18 - anymore
80:19 - let's see what this issue is
80:29 - server oh well now the servers actually
80:31 - offline so that's gonna be the issue
80:36 - okay let's try this one more time
80:45 - try this Tim server offline so it's just
80:54 - printing oh I'm not ready Tim let's go
81:04 - this float object is not callable what
81:10 - did I do here subline um float object is
81:18 - not callable that's gonna be in here
81:20 - somewhere that I did this mess son float
81:28 - object is not call well I don't even
81:30 - know where that is time time okay okay
81:46 - where is my github yeah I think I'm
81:48 - gonna go for like another 40 minutes
81:49 - we'll see like we'll get ups like two
81:51 - hours because I am determined to try to
81:54 - fix this and then we'll see
82:11 - alright redownload again guys I'm typing
82:14 - it in the chat because I know it's
82:15 - something you won't see it I'm having
82:16 - silly syntax errors I should test this
82:18 - before I upload it to github I know I'm
82:19 - an idiot but it's fun let's run this now
82:22 - and what this one's probably gonna work
82:25 - either
82:26 - I'm just like going out at each time
82:27 - let's see oh there we go
82:29 - we're in ok so I fix something again I
82:35 - have no idea if this is gonna do
82:36 - anything we have no but you guys you
82:38 - need you need to redownload otherwise
82:39 - it's just gonna kick you every time you
82:40 - try to go in you just hop you got to
82:42 - redownload it otherwise it's not gonna
82:44 - work where's my pie game window my pie
82:52 - game thing shut down I don't know what
82:56 - happened to it run this again main game
83:03 - Tim so I got in ok you're a block so
83:09 - someone's on right now I guess we'll see
83:11 - if someone moves
83:13 - how does Tim type and talk yeah it's an
83:16 - interesting question what is that issue
83:23 - getting some some air here I don't know
83:26 - what it is though I gotta wait for
83:30 - someone else to build successfully
83:31 - connect slow mode maybe no I don't need
83:33 - snow mode it's fine my turn
83:46 - okay so far so good
83:49 - Oh bites at your object has no actually
83:53 - ran out of input ran on input by jumping
83:56 - to actually time one okay so that means
84:04 - it didn't unpick lit um okay sub line
84:09 - bytes object has no attribute time one
84:13 - which would probably be mean that I
84:16 - didn't unpick alit so reply equals
84:18 - pickled loads and I'm returning reply
84:22 - which would just be this because
84:24 - something didn't happen there oh I can't
84:30 - return reply unless we make it over this
84:35 - loop so only if we get to here are we
84:44 - good
84:44 - so because that should be the end of the
84:47 - wallet I only want to break if this
84:49 - works properly break I got Rando to
84:54 - input thing I'm running on a bun - yeah
84:56 - no okay that's let's fix this uh I just
85:01 - got to modify this client file inside
85:04 - live stream thank you guys again for the
85:07 - feedback does really help a lot and
85:09 - let's go can't change that and
85:17 - commit changes what is it case someone
85:21 - was complaining why is this on this
85:22 - playlist it's gonna one I haven't heard
85:25 - yet rockabyebaby comes on in the
85:32 - playlist I know great selling right ok
85:33 - let's run that ivory up I've updated it
85:45 - just like it yes you gonna have to keep
85:47 - downloading it is B if you have the git
85:49 - command you could just keep pulling it
85:50 - it'll be easy but Tim waited for player
85:56 - alright my turn an established
86:06 - connection was aborted by the software
86:07 - in your host machine by itself guys know
86:11 - what ready established connection was
86:22 - how do you know not minecraft is your
86:35 - host machine but not minecraft
86:36 - Python I've just finished watching the
86:40 - tower defense fit how do you like it man
86:41 - using some Frank no I'm using no
86:43 - framework i coded this from scratch
86:45 - which is probably why it's not working
86:46 - and established and remover suffer
86:48 - heroes machine let's see what the issue
86:51 - is here timeout or the never network
86:52 - connection died firewall see do we think
87:00 - it could be a firewall issue
87:02 - timeout to other network network
87:03 - connection dot firewall close the
87:04 - connection because it was open too long
87:06 - connection was closed before process has
87:09 - been finished
87:17 - there's not really a framework it just
87:19 - like I don't know solution disable
87:33 - antivirus disable firewall okay so which
87:37 - it could be an issue with that but I
87:39 - never had any issue before with that hmm
87:52 - let's see
88:02 - so that was the issue that was like run
88:05 - into object has not recovered
88:06 - all right well that's a new issue just
88:08 - there's just a lot you know the funny
88:10 - thing is like this works for like two
88:12 - people I just don't even work for a law
88:16 - so I assume it's just an issue with like
88:17 - it can't handle all these people and I
88:19 - just haven't coated in a way to handle
88:21 - these people socket air and establish
88:22 - connection
88:23 - I should really maybe open like a new
88:25 - socket after a certain amount of people
88:27 - connect why do I keep getting air output
88:33 - this pipe air occurs server responds to
88:36 - requests and the client has already
88:37 - closed the connection browsers do that
88:40 - sometimes finite usage you can ignore
88:42 - this web okay so that means like I want
88:45 - to make sure this client the client
88:48 - doesn't close the connection on himself
88:49 - so where is do I would even close this
88:53 - I'm gonna disconnect here anywhere well
88:57 - time time current II reply equals pickle
89:02 - uploads
89:07 - hmm people that load should load that
89:13 - into an object no I don't need to like
89:15 - cast it or something hmm
89:23 - Piccolo's ply said bytes object has no
89:29 - attribute which means it didn't get
89:31 - loaded in which means when I returned
89:33 - reply would have returned that not that
89:38 - okay
89:43 - who
89:47 - it should really just keep calling until
89:49 - it returns all right we'll do a time out
89:55 - we'll do a longer time out maybe less
90:01 - than ten I don't want to just keep like
90:03 - spamming the error message though
90:07 - invalid load key eight pickle data was
90:10 - truncated I don't know what the heck
90:13 - that error is some guy keeps keeps
90:17 - naming himself hi Tim Tim you really
90:19 - should save your name I should have done
90:21 - that all right let's try this
90:29 - we need to watch that console output oh
90:34 - oh okay I moved it was just lagging I
90:40 - guess so connection was reset means that
90:45 - some like from the client-side it reset
90:48 - the connection which I have no idea how
90:50 - to fix that this game seems to be
90:53 - working smoothly
90:54 - raisa say that's probably in a crash but
90:56 - we'll see see established connection was
91:08 - aborted by the software in your host
91:09 - machine
91:15 - yeah that's established can I don't know
91:22 - to fix that that's the issue
91:32 - Python sockets okay I'm gonna keep going
91:36 - out this for a little bit cuz I can fix
91:37 - that and I might be able to get against
91:38 - you guys
91:38 - but I don't know what we've seen the ER
91:40 - flask okay when running tests to install
91:44 - an established connection I could bump
91:57 - that connection timeout but it shouldn't
91:59 - be a connection issue on hmm you try to
92:06 - reconnect now cuz then it has to start
92:08 - nuke this is a very complicated issue
92:10 - take your time you don't need to be
92:12 - stressed or anything I'm not stressed I
92:13 - just want a little bit stressed but I
92:15 - won't figure this out and it's just
92:17 - frustrating because I had it working so
92:19 - well for two games and then as soon as I
92:21 - went to maybe server blocks the
92:24 - real-time sockets because a lot of
92:25 - requests at the same time I'm gonna send
92:27 - an email to the guys that on my server
92:32 - I'm just gonna post on my other tab and
92:34 - just see if I can get them to respond
92:36 - because maybe there's a firewall on
92:38 - there that's blocking that so let's see
92:40 - if that's the issue so I gotta go to
92:43 - again big shout it to cherry servers
92:45 - they hooked me up with this server it's
92:48 - not definitely not their fault that's
92:49 - not working it's probably mine um like
92:54 - two cherry servers
93:06 - are you guys still trying to connect let
93:09 - me know if you guys are working or not I
93:10 - like you guys get in a game I think in
93:12 - that it just crashes like there's a
93:13 - timeout or something on the server but
93:16 - it does work like the game works
93:18 - everything that's functional it's just
93:20 - that it's just the server issue right so
93:23 - put that down oh man you guys got kicked
93:33 - again I'm mister I'm just on my other
93:39 - monitor right now guys just working
93:40 - developing a game is very hard it can be
93:42 - fixed at once and it can't be fixed at
93:45 - once oh yeah for sure I know you mean
93:46 - that I do think that firewall might be
93:49 - issue let's see here I'm just logging
94:01 - into the cherry server here and getting
94:05 - these guys see if they can help me out I
94:09 - don't know if there's a way to like
94:11 - disable the firewall on my server we'll
94:14 - see though let me we'll get it the hosts
94:21 - load on it too and see if it's like
94:22 - going crazy yeah says it can handle 3
94:33 - gigabits per second bandwidth or that's
94:34 - what it has your bandwidth so this
94:36 - should be fine networking
95:48 - hmm so I'm talking to Zack right now
95:52 - Adam cherry servers and we'll see if he
95:57 - gets back to me we can see what's
95:58 - happening here player as our left game
96:00 - but I didn't connect really what how
96:12 - does it have why would that be happening
96:14 - okay no it's because the thread that
96:17 - didn't end when you guys leave sometimes
96:18 - the thread actually doesn't end oh that
96:20 - can be an issue you I'm hey Tim by the
96:22 - way oh
96:25 - so some hey Tim there should not be any
96:27 - firewall and server by default
96:31 - just running some here let me put this
96:35 - on my other tab here okay so apparently
97:05 - is no firewall in the server so that's
97:07 - not the issue and you guys are saying
97:09 - that you're seeing your names in the
97:11 - console which is how do I see okay let's
97:16 - try this which is like kind of blowing
97:18 - my mind too
97:21 - so that means that the threads aren't
97:23 - stopping so we gotta fix that so thread
97:26 - try break print exception has eat break
97:32 - because I would kick you so we'll just
97:34 - break okay so let's try that now on the
97:38 - server side
97:41 - you know and that wind SB
97:53 - I'm hatin Oh the king of mystery will it
97:56 - make sense because your name is the king
97:58 - of mystery all right let's try this
98:02 - again and go No everyone go try to
98:09 - connect so now I'm starting to think
98:11 - maybe it's an issue I'm like that who
98:13 - knows at this point someone connected
98:15 - let's go to desktop chess game game I
98:22 - will play against you all right there
98:25 - turn hey Tim's time fifteen Tim's time
98:29 - all right
98:30 - see this works ah we left
98:42 - establish connection was aborted by the
98:45 - software in your host machine like I
98:49 - don't know what the heck that means
98:51 - maybe I need to disable firewall if I
98:54 - disable firewall and this works it's
99:00 - probably a bad idea to do this but let's
99:02 - see the main firewall off let's try it
99:07 - out I don't leave that off for long but
99:09 - let's see if this works now
99:18 - hey Tim is back in once again oh alright
99:28 - let's see no issues yet I don't know why
99:41 - I did that I'm just literally randomly
99:43 - moving pieces because I already know
99:44 - that it's just gonna break at some point
99:47 - let's go
99:53 - Nathan you missed quite a bit my friend
99:59 - game one ended connection reset by Peter
100:02 - okay
100:02 - oh dude to Castle that's not how you do
100:04 - it if you wanted to Castle you got to do
100:06 - castle and then hit King but I can't do
100:08 - it because you moved the dude oh so it
100:15 - wasn't the firewall that was the issue
100:16 - let's turn that back on yeah so that's
100:23 - just not the issue
100:26 - okay so go to client no might have to do
100:32 - another part time where I try to do this
100:33 - I really wanted to get a bunch of people
100:35 - going on he was working at first like
100:36 - kinda but then not really strange
100:40 - everyone is called player none yeah I
100:41 - don't know why this called player none I
100:43 - don't know why it's Nathan if you guys
100:45 - see your names and you not connecting
100:46 - then like let me know but who knows
100:51 - so yeah I think threaded clients friends
100:56 - exception II connection reset by peers
101:00 - so it's happening on the client side
101:01 - that it's just disconnecting oh I should
101:04 - probably change the socket timeout on
101:06 - the client side too cuz I down the
101:09 - server side to be oh wait did I don't
101:13 - have that I swear I added like
101:17 - Oh cuz I just brought it back to my
101:19 - other server alright let's see here um
101:24 - okay change socket default time outs
101:30 - this is like the last wind if this
101:33 - doesn't work then we I don't want to
101:35 - give up but we might have to socket dot
101:37 - set default timeout so I'm gonna try
101:41 - this on mine set as a ten-second timeout
101:45 - and then we'll try it on this as well so
101:48 - socket dot set default timeout that's
101:50 - ten seconds I know that sounds long but
101:52 - in chess it's like slow glee anyways so
101:54 - that's probably not that important I
101:55 - would you want to try another Network
101:57 - game like this okay so I got a push I
102:02 - got I'm gonna have to reset this chess
102:05 - game server yes waiting for connections
102:14 - okay
102:18 - game Tim all right waiting for player
102:25 - should get him here there we go okay you
102:28 - are white my turn Oh ran out of input 51
102:35 - what the heck is that
102:41 - invalid load key I know it doesn't it's
102:46 - literally it's yeah it's weird
102:48 - PLC invalid load
102:55 - pickle the air you get is a standard
102:58 - error yet when the network gets with
103:01 - wrong file format what causes the error
103:04 - what the heck
103:14 - [Music]
103:21 - most common pickles to pickle everything
103:23 - with a single dump to a file but then
103:25 - you have to load everything at once with
103:27 - a single load however if you open a file
103:29 - here and it'll do multiple dump calls
103:31 - then your load will mirror that your
103:34 - open we're trying to achieve
103:49 - okay it'll be relevant I had some a
103:57 - problem when the pickle archive had been
103:58 - created using gzip compressed pickle
104:01 - archive has been like this try to open
104:03 - it throws errors but if the pickle is
104:05 - open gzip all is harmonious hmm
104:13 - unpicking err unbowed load key I don't
104:16 - know what that means
104:20 - try to unpick 'el something that had not
104:23 - originally been pickled yeah I know what
104:30 - truncated is I know I fixed like that
104:32 - one's a pretty easy fix but it just this
104:34 - one is kind of weird okay so reply Oh
104:40 - pickle dot loads
104:41 - am I ever sending anything back that's
104:44 - not what did this client used to look
104:48 - like now I don't have the old version of
104:51 - oh I do have the old version of client I
104:52 - can look at that chess game and it was
104:57 - ideal Eve yeah this game is built on
105:00 - Python whoever asked that pic equals
105:07 - okay if pick something like that send
105:14 - people the thumbs ok reply the only
105:17 - thing this should receive
105:23 - is pickled Dada though
105:29 - so wonder if I'm ever sending any downa
105:32 - back that's not pickles self declined a
105:35 - sentence during not encode data applying
105:37 - was something I'd receive if I was
105:41 - people download your ploy turn play
105:44 - [Music]
105:47 - let's see this pickle download reply ok
106:02 - so I don't know how I'm getting that
106:03 - error now that I've added this timeout
106:13 - so I don't know if I need this like
106:16 - timeout thing anymore let's get rid of
106:18 - this I know I could've just shift-tab
106:21 - this but you know we didn't do that so
106:23 - let's get rid of the hots so try this
106:26 - now and let's open this with ideally
106:30 - such a scheme game oh we don't need
106:40 - break anymore them okay let's edit this
106:43 - break you guys I said you guys I love
106:45 - how you guys are still trying to connect
106:47 - just the persistency I love it um okay
106:50 - let's try this game I feel like he was
106:53 - working better at the beginning then I
106:54 - mess with all this stuff and now who
106:56 - knows
106:56 - alright someone join should I use Python
107:02 - as hacking purpose I don't know man I'm
107:05 - just waiting for someone to connect so I
107:06 - can play against someone alright my
107:10 - chain Oh player Tim left game let's see
107:15 - what is our issue here why did that
107:17 - dinosaur ideally
107:24 - Tim you just instantly disconnects now
107:26 - so that's interesting
107:30 - where's my freaking thing server offline
107:37 - service not off on there just oh my gosh
107:41 - other player left holy crap
107:46 - router the input ran out of input menu
107:49 - screen missing one required potential
107:52 - argument name Oh gonna fix that okay
107:55 - bytes object has actually ready ran out
107:57 - of input ran out of input so it's
108:03 - something with the sending yeah I don't
108:08 - know man I am NOT a Python developer no
108:11 - well I mean I don't know what do you
108:12 - consider a Python developer I do a lot
108:14 - of development with Python but I don't
108:15 - have a job as a Python developer ran out
108:18 - of input data stream to go thumbs Bo
108:22 - which is the board client pickle dot
108:27 - loads fly
108:42 - I don't know guys
108:52 - don't know what is going on here it's
108:54 - sending back the board it's now we're
109:02 - getting an issue here we're like we're
109:07 - like all menu screen button menu screen
109:09 - win name could fix that okay let's just
109:16 - dress again it's like you need some
109:22 - break no breaks what I break I'm just
109:25 - gonna get off this to be honest I still
109:26 - haven't even eaten dinner yet so I got
109:28 - to do that probably go for another few
109:30 - minutes see how this works
109:33 - Tim all right load that up I don't know
109:36 - why that doesn't come to the forefront
109:40 - unpicking stack on unpicking stack
109:43 - underflow that's a new one let's try
109:46 - this one I think now it's time to read
109:51 - maybe you're gonna restart the server I
109:52 - don't know I haven't restarted the
109:55 - server in a while try that address
110:02 - already in you so I closed it too quick
110:03 - and this oh my god it doesn't okay under
110:13 - pickling understand a flourish and
110:17 - pickling under flow here this is what
110:21 - this when pickle ends unexpectedly here
110:26 - self to request to receive your
110:27 - seemingly 12 bytes max you pick a large
110:28 - must be longer than 12 bytes so gets cut
110:30 - off I would not recommend to handling
110:32 - TCP sockets directly unless you're very
110:34 - familiar with networking and you need
110:36 - high-performance justing HTTP to wrap
110:38 - your messages in using HTTP library if
110:40 - you do have to be able T to be directly
110:42 - of two choices you can agree on a
110:44 - terminal string
110:52 - when you up this code is on github guys
110:55 - console gave me air 32 broken pipe oh my
110:59 - god alright so it's just a socket error
111:09 - listen process could not create a
111:11 - dedicated process to handle the client
111:13 - requests the error is caused by a
111:14 - resource exhaustion issue either with
111:16 - the OS or within the Oracle Oh God
111:19 - socket air air 32 broken pipe also the
111:25 - following may need to be changed ok so I
111:37 - just gotta find a better way to send
111:44 - large pickle over socket
111:52 - okay hmm socket our byte stream so
112:16 - ideally to write your protocol read this
112:18 - this is a bass amp without protocol
112:20 - should be careful but buffer receive oh
112:23 - yeah because okay so pickle a file over
112:27 - socket IO bytes IO what does that do
112:48 - hmm so the way that I'm sending this
112:54 - data is just like bad that's that's
112:58 - that's the issue python pickle pickling
113:03 - over socket I don't want to read all
113:07 - that
113:16 - Pikul the loads case how do you get size
113:20 - of pic Madonna why would the sink a
113:25 - happy birthday
113:25 - it's interesting pickled data Python
113:44 - since the size of serialized pickle of
113:46 - knowledge can be quite different from
113:47 - the size of the object in memory
113:50 - we should probably persist 5 bytes how
113:52 - to get byte size of pickled out in
113:56 - Python
114:04 - okay I'm just gonna try this again run
114:15 - f5 Tim
114:23 - playing against Johnny right now I don't
114:26 - know who Johnny is but let's see if if
114:27 - we can get a game going other player
114:28 - left pickle data was truncated by table
114:31 - because not she ready all right guys so
114:35 - it's almost been two hours how long has
114:38 - it been actually and we're not really
114:41 - getting anywhere here I'm gonna look at
114:42 - this and see what I can do with the
114:47 - sending of data I think that all I
114:50 - really need to figure out and I you guys
114:52 - have obviously helped me realize this is
114:55 - um that the the way this data is sending
115:00 - is just not it's just not good I need a
115:03 - better way to send this data so well not
115:06 - send receive the data sending it is
115:09 - actually fine I need a better way to
115:11 - receive it on the the client and a
115:13 - better way to send it from the server
115:14 - and so if I just sit down and focus on
115:18 - this like half an hour she probably
115:20 - figured out but I am gonna end the
115:21 - stream now big thank you to everyone who
115:24 - joined again another thank you to cherry
115:26 - servers for hooking me up with that
115:27 - server definitely not their fault that
115:29 - this isn't working I just probably you
115:30 - know messed something up and I really do
115:32 - appreciate everyone helping me out on
115:33 - this I had a good time chatting with you
115:36 - guys and do this unfortunately I
115:37 - couldn't get it to work but you know
115:38 - sometimes that's how it goes and now I'm
115:40 - gonna learn from the mistakes and
115:41 - hopefully be able to fix this and do
115:43 - something better in the next time you
115:44 - guys have any other ideas for streams or
115:46 - more stuff that you want to see
115:48 - definitely let me know I really enjoy
115:51 - doing these streams and like if I can do
115:52 - some more shorter ones that are only
115:54 - like 2 hours long that fits my time
115:56 - schedule kind of a little bit better cuz
115:58 - the last ones I did were like 2 3 4 like
116:00 - no what am I saying
116:02 - they were like 12 and 18 hours long so
116:05 - yeah anyways guys once again thank you
116:08 - gonna hop off the stream now and I
116:10 - definitely will if you guys subscribe to
116:11 - the channel you guys will know when I do
116:13 - more streams and all that kind of fun
116:14 - stuff so see you guys later
