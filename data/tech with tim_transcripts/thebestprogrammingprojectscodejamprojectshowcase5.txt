00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - hello everybody and welcome to the fifth
00:10 - tech with tim code jam project showcase
00:13 - in this video i'm going to be showing
00:15 - you some awesome programming projects
00:17 - and announcing the winner of the fifth
00:19 - tech with tim code gem as well as the
00:20 - run up third place and a few other
00:22 - prizes that we have for this code gym if
00:25 - you want to learn more about the code
00:26 - jam and what it is make sure you join
00:28 - the discord server there will be a link
00:29 - in the description but a quick summary
00:31 - is about every two months in my discord
00:33 - server we run this competition it's
00:35 - called code jam we also call it timothon
00:37 - kind of combining tim and hackathon
00:39 - together and participants have about a
00:41 - month to actually work in teams of up to
00:44 - six people to create some type of
00:46 - project based on a theme and then submit
00:48 - that project at the end all those
00:50 - submissions were graded or judged we had
00:52 - a judging panel which is kind of some
00:54 - volunteers from the discord server i'm
00:56 - going to be showing you in this video
00:58 - the top five projects then selecting the
01:01 - three winning teams as well as showing
01:03 - you the two best projects that were
01:05 - hosted on replit which is the sponsor of
01:07 - this codegen so for this code jam we
01:09 - teamed up with replit some of you
01:11 - probably know them they are an awesome
01:13 - company super dedicated to helping the
01:15 - programming community and while an
01:16 - awesome place to work on code and to
01:18 - actually host projects so you can see
01:21 - brought to you by replit i'll go over to
01:22 - the website here you can see you can
01:24 - code create and learn together on replit
01:27 - it is a free collaborative in browser
01:29 - ide i've actually done some tutorials
01:32 - using replit in the past i know the
01:34 - replit team just really great guys and a
01:36 - great team in general and while it has a
01:38 - lot of awesome features on this platform
01:40 - so if you're on mobile if you just don't
01:42 - want to set up a development environment
01:43 - on your own you can use replic
01:45 - completely for free and actually all of
01:48 - the participants that were in the top
01:50 - five and in the top two replit projects
01:53 - are going to be getting free replit
01:54 - hacker plans which is kind of like an
01:56 - upgraded plan that allows you to do more
01:58 - stuff on replica anyways check them out
02:00 - from the link in the description
02:01 - seriously a great company and super
02:03 - happy that they were able to work with
02:04 - us for this code jam last thing i'll
02:07 - mention here is that you can actually
02:08 - host websites and projects with replit
02:11 - so that was kind of another category we
02:13 - added to this code jam the top two
02:15 - projects that were hosted using replit
02:17 - are going to be getting a prize as well
02:19 - they'll also be getting those hacker
02:21 - plans sweet so thanks again to replit
02:24 - now what i'm going to do is just talk to
02:25 - you about the theme of this code gem and
02:27 - then i'm going to show you all of the
02:28 - projects so the theme here was
02:30 - exploration you guys can kind of read
02:32 - through this doc if you want but pretty
02:34 - much anything that fits the theme
02:36 - exploration was you know valid to be
02:38 - submitted and then if we're looking at
02:40 - the criteria here for judging all of
02:42 - these projects we see they're judged on
02:44 - theme functionality code and
02:46 - intuitiveness now you can read more at
02:48 - this link all of this stuff i'll leave
02:49 - in the description in case you guys are
02:51 - curious and then if you scroll down here
02:53 - you can see all of the different teams
02:54 - and then you can view their submissions
02:56 - so without further ado let me go ahead
02:58 - and dive in here and show you the top
03:00 - five projects and then the top two
03:02 - projects hosted on replica alright so
03:04 - i've got the first project in front of
03:06 - me i will remind you that all of these
03:08 - projects were judged by a judging panel
03:10 - and then the amount of points they got
03:12 - was the average of what all of the
03:13 - judges gave them so i'm showing you the
03:15 - projects in the order of highest points
03:17 - to lowest points so this project had the
03:19 - most amount of points as you know
03:21 - decided by the judges all right so this
03:23 - first project is called solario or solar
03:26 - io it is by zenyu liang who has competed
03:29 - in a few other coding competitions as
03:31 - well nice to see you back here so let's
03:33 - go ahead and check it out and see what
03:35 - this project is about all right so
03:37 - immediately looks quite nice i like the
03:39 - ui it says explore the space discover
03:41 - the beyond all right let's press explore
03:44 - our solar system the world swirler came
03:46 - from the latin word soul which means sun
03:48 - nice nice i'm not going to read all of
03:50 - that let's see what learn more does
03:52 - oh this is kind of cool sun a star
03:54 - located at the center of the solar
03:56 - system gives me a definition let's have
03:58 - a look at the simulation here wow okay
04:00 - that's cool i love when you guys do
04:02 - these kind of animations and simulations
04:04 - and stuff it always looks really cool uh
04:06 - nice okay can i click on a specific

04:10 - oh it highlights the ring that this
04:11 - planet is in okay that's kind of neat
04:14 - let's go back
04:15 - let's see can i press on these oh that's
04:17 - cool let's let's go earth simulation
04:20 - okay it just shows me the same
04:21 - simulation
04:22 - nice very cool let's go planets okay
04:25 - that's what that is let's go do games
04:27 - fps is zero um oh there we go press
04:30 - space to start
04:33 - uh this is kind of cool okay how do i
04:35 - move here
04:36 - oh the arrow keys move me around
04:39 - okay my only complaint is that it
04:40 - doesn't oh i can't hold the arrow keys
04:42 - it's just kind of
04:43 - laggy and i guess i'm trying to avoid

04:55 - play through the entire thing because i
04:56 - don't know how long that is let's go to
04:58 - news here news about space learn more
05:01 - okay this just brings me to another
05:02 - website uh that has space news but that
05:05 - is coolspace.com nice and contact okay i
05:08 - guess i could send an email to them if i

07:15 - didn't need to buy it
07:16 - nice okay let's go back to dashboard it
07:19 - shows me the ones that i've read
07:21 - and then i can click on that let's go
07:22 - back to dashboard here looks like you
07:24 - don't have any activity to show i'm not
07:26 - sure what activity would show up here
07:29 - but i think i've pretty much explored no
07:31 - pun intended uh what this actually does
07:34 - really cool website neat idea and yeah
07:37 - that just seems like a cool thing i feel
07:38 - like i'm missing something because i
07:40 - think it should show me something in
07:42 - my dashboard here for activity uh but
07:44 - either way being able to look up books
07:46 - read them online get recommendations a
07:48 - very cool idea nice work on this project
07:50 - all right so i've got the third project
07:52 - in front of me here this one is called
07:54 - plain explore it's a website that helps
07:56 - you meet the aircraft world it is by
07:58 - these two contributors right here so
08:00 - let's go ahead and click into it and see
08:03 - what it looks like all right join the
08:05 - plane world or planesworld sorry and
08:08 - then features let's click on features
08:10 - and these are the three features it has
08:11 - so take a look at the planes flying
08:13 - around the world scan all planes that
08:14 - are nearby find all future flights that
08:16 - match your settings okay let's click
08:18 - into globe exploration
08:20 - uh nice it's showing me a globe here
08:23 - okay that's kind of cool looks like it's
08:25 - loading or we're lagging can i can i
08:27 - move this around okay i can move it
08:29 - around and i can look at different
08:30 - planes and it shows me all the planes
08:32 - flying above that's kind of crazy when
08:34 - you see how many are going above at one
08:36 - point in time like just constantly
08:38 - flights going on okay let's see what
08:40 - happens if i move this slider um can i
08:43 - can i move this
08:44 - for some reason i can't move this slider
08:46 - okay i got the slider to work now i just
08:48 - cleared my cache but this is just like
08:50 - really really laggy like to the point
08:52 - where like my computer is like literally
08:54 - lagging using this even getting out of
08:56 - the tab uh but it does seem to be
08:59 - working i'm not really sure
09:01 - what this earth hour is supposed to do i
09:03 - think it just changes like the amount of
09:05 - light that's currently on earth because
09:07 - it doesn't when i was moving it doesn't
09:08 - seem like the plans were moving at all
09:10 - anyways let's just go on to the next
09:11 - feature now because this one is just
09:12 - lagging my computer like crazy uh scan
09:15 - nearby okay let's check this one out i'm
09:17 - not going to get my location because i
09:19 - don't want you guys to know where that
09:20 - is let's look at can i go to street maps
09:23 - style or let's change it to hybrid oh
09:25 - that's cool okay so it changes the
09:26 - actual map style
09:27 - let's zoom out and let's find planes in
09:31 - this location within 100 kilometer
09:33 - radius okay zoom out and that's cool
09:35 - okay so it shows me the plans that are
09:36 - currently flying above and i can
09:37 - actually click on them okay that's neat
09:39 - and i can see where it's coming from and
09:41 - where it's landing okay that's actually
09:42 - really cool and i guess these guys are
09:43 - currently on the runway and does it show
09:45 - me where it's going
09:47 - damn okay that's really cool this is a
09:49 - cool feature this is probably my
09:50 - favorite feature so far
09:52 - uh let's
09:53 - make the radius larger let's go to like
09:57 - 440 kilometers okay i actually think it
09:59 - starts showing me them before i press
10:01 - find and then when i press find it just
10:02 - puts the radius up there uh either way
10:04 - that's fine this guy
10:07 - shows me it's yeah it shows me all the
10:09 - information and then can i can i click
10:11 - more on this uh no okay that's just
10:13 - showing it to me nice okay that's really
10:15 - really cool this is a nice feature let's
10:18 - go back to the streets map and okay yeah
10:22 - it just changes the thing very nice okay
10:24 - let's go on to the next feature here
10:26 - which is the find flights
10:29 - all right so right now we're looking for
10:30 - a flight from these two airports which i
10:32 - don't know i'm going to change them to
10:33 - ones that i do know so let's look for
10:35 - one from yyz to let's just go lax famous
10:39 - airport
10:40 - let's change the date to be here
10:44 - okay currency can be us dollars and
10:47 - let's search
10:49 - okay it doesn't look like it's showing
10:51 - me anything it's possible maybe there's
10:52 - not a flight going from here uh what's
10:55 - the vancouver airport yv
10:58 - um
10:59 - actually i don't know what it's called
11:00 - i'm trying to look for another canadian
11:01 - airport uh is there a montreal airport i
11:04 - don't know what any of the other airport
11:05 - codes are uh let's go with just y
11:08 - yvz i think that's one see so i feel
11:11 - like these should be updating here to
11:12 - tell me what these are but it's not when
11:15 - i press search so maybe this feature is
11:17 - just not working
11:18 - because it's not
11:20 - showing me anything if this feature does
11:22 - work someone let me know in the comments
11:23 - but right now it doesn't seem like it is
11:25 - working i'll change this one more time
11:27 - and see okay let's change this date to
11:29 - the 26 search okay i i think this one's
11:32 - just not working so i'm going to skip
11:34 - over this okay let's go to the about
11:35 - page
11:36 - uh we have boat timothon repo okay nice
11:39 - little animations here oh that's cool
11:41 - when i move my mouse there's like a
11:42 - gradient that goes over it and then
11:44 - gives me a little explanation of how
11:46 - this works uh web application server
11:48 - configuration front end development nice
11:50 - nice nice and i think that's pretty much
11:52 - all i needed to look at here i see an
11:55 - issue in bug can i report it oh that's
11:56 - cool that they have these
11:58 - nice
11:59 - okay so i think that is plane explorer
12:01 - let's move on to the next project all
12:03 - right so i've got the fourth project in
12:05 - front of me here explore space like
12:07 - never before i'm not actually sure what
12:09 - the name of it is because i don't think
12:10 - this is the name of the project and
12:12 - that's just the name of the repo
12:14 - but it has an about page explore our
12:16 - solar system and some of the most common
12:18 - star constellations in the web by your
12:20 - own hands
12:21 - nice okay let's click on the link here
12:23 - and let's see what this looks like
12:25 - actually sorry i want to first show the
12:27 - contributors of this i want to try to do
12:28 - that for all of them these are the three
12:30 - contributors i believe uh although it
12:33 - says uh i'm for oh these are okay that's
12:35 - information about all three of the
12:37 - contributors nice nice size okay let's
12:38 - go back to the website and let's see

16:16 - awesome nice website looks really cool
16:18 - some great information there i like the
16:20 - fact that you can leave reviews and you
16:22 - have hashtags just a lot of features on
16:23 - this website so nice job all right so
16:25 - now it is time for me to talk to you
16:27 - about the top two projects that were
16:28 - hosted on replit all of these team
16:31 - members will be getting a free replit
16:33 - hacker plan as well as all the other
16:35 - projects that i've showed you that were
16:36 - in the top five and uh there'll be some
16:39 - prizes for these projects as well all
16:41 - right so the first best project that was
16:44 - hosted on replit is the one i actually
16:45 - just showed you which is airborne so
16:47 - that makes my life a little bit easier
16:48 - i'm not obviously going to go demo the
16:50 - project again but they were the top
16:52 - project that was hosted on replit you
16:54 - can see that this actually hosts on
16:56 - replies.repple.com and you can look at
16:58 - all of the code directly on replit if
17:00 - you go to the submissions page on the
17:02 - timathon website all right the next best
17:05 - project that was hosted on replit is
17:07 - fact explore so you can see obviously
17:09 - we're on replit right now and what this
17:12 - allows you to do is actually explore
17:13 - different facts in israel it is legal to
17:15 - bring bears to the beach okay that
17:17 - that's interesting
17:19 - there is an uninhabited island in the
17:20 - bahamas known as pig beach which is
17:23 - populated entirely by swimming pigs okay
17:25 - these are kind of fun facts
17:27 - fifty percent of apartments in los
17:29 - angeles don't come with a fridge
17:31 - really this is legal as fridges are
17:33 - considered an amenity and therefore
17:35 - landlords are not required to provide
17:36 - one damn mount rushmore cost less than 1
17:39 - million dollars to construct took 14
17:41 - years to build from 1927 to 1941 and
17:43 - took 400 workers wow okay these are
17:46 - actually some pretty interesting facts
17:47 - oh of course this is what the about page
17:49 - is i'm sure you guys are going to get a
17:50 - laugh from that
17:51 - and this is by cry menzin uh again
17:55 - probably mispronouncing that but nice
17:57 - work you are the second winner for the
18:00 - top projects hosted on replay all right
18:02 - so now what you guys have all been
18:04 - waiting for the top three winners of the
18:07 - code jam before i get into those i will
18:09 - quickly mention that all of these
18:10 - projects have been great in fact i
18:12 - looked at a lot of the other projects
18:13 - that weren't in the top five you guys
18:15 - have done a great job i hope you're
18:16 - going to compete in future code gems and
18:18 - for any of you just watching join the
18:20 - discord server take a look at the code
18:21 - gem consider teaming up with someone
18:23 - it's really a great opportunity to
18:25 - practice your skills alright so let me
18:27 - hop over to the other screen and i will
18:29 - show you the top three winning projects
18:31 - all right so coming in at third place
18:33 - for the fifth tech with tim code jam is
18:36 - drum roll please add some suspension
18:38 - editors
18:40 - airborne airborne is number three so the
18:42 - reason i picked this project for number
18:44 - three is i thought this was a good idea
18:47 - this project is unique i haven't really
18:49 - seen any other ones like this that are
18:50 - actually related to exploring different
18:52 - locations that you could go and visit
18:55 - everything worked everything was
18:56 - relatively polished the ui looks pretty
18:58 - good
18:59 - we have lots of lots of features like
19:01 - hashtags learn more visited which i can
19:04 - click on i have my profile that stores
19:06 - my favorite cities my search history i
19:09 - just thought overall it was a good job
19:11 - everything seemed to work and that's one
19:13 - of the big things for me when i go on
19:14 - these projects i want stuff to be
19:16 - intuitive i want stuff to work and i
19:18 - shouldn't have to read through your
19:19 - entire readme instructions to be able to
19:21 - navigate and use the website so really
19:23 - good job congratulations i'll put up the
19:25 - contributors on the screen for this
19:27 - project now i'm going to announce the
19:29 - second place project so the second place
19:32 - project is drum roll please
19:35 - solario or solar io
19:38 - this project was really well done i'll
19:40 - just kind of go through it again and
19:42 - show you what it had so it had the
19:43 - different planets here you could click
19:45 - on them and get information about them
19:47 - and you can kind of scroll through them
19:48 - you can look at a pretty basic
19:50 - simulation that shows you the orbits and
19:51 - relative speed of these planets and then
19:55 - there was a game on here that you could
19:56 - play right
19:57 - so this kind of space shooter game
19:59 - won't go through it but well done also
20:01 - had news about space
20:03 - contact information everything was
20:05 - polished
20:06 - everything worked lots of feature
20:08 - features fit the theme very well
20:10 - and the reason this got second over
20:12 - third was just because i thought it
20:13 - looked a little bit nicer it looked a
20:15 - little bit more professional and you
20:17 - know it's my opinion my bias that's why
20:19 - i picked this for number two all right
20:21 - so coming in at first place drum roll
20:25 - please is
20:26 - books explore now i'm not gonna lie when
20:29 - i first opened this i was a little bit
20:30 - underwhelmed because it seemed like
20:32 - there should be more features than i was
20:33 - looking at but as i started actually
20:36 - looking through this website more when i
20:37 - wasn't recording i noticed that there
20:39 - was a lot more that you can do with it
20:41 - and you can see here that people
20:43 - actually just started following me so
20:44 - that's why i was confused with the
20:45 - activity tab i didn't realize like
20:47 - something like this could occur and when
20:49 - i click on these people's profiles you
20:51 - can see that actually shows me all of
20:52 - their reviews shows me the book that
20:54 - they reviewed i can click on any recent
20:55 - books that they've looked at here it
20:57 - shows me all the people they're
20:58 - following i can scroll through all of
21:00 - their followers their reviews i can
21:02 - follow them like that
21:03 - and now if i go over to explore i can
21:06 - actually search for users as well so
21:08 - this was a user that i'd found
21:09 - previously if i go to users you can see
21:12 - i can find him
21:13 - click on him and well there's a lot more
21:15 - features to this than i originally
21:16 - thought and i just really like this idea
21:19 - of kind of encouraging people to read
21:21 - review books
21:22 - just seemed really cool the account is
21:24 - working i can click on my profile i can
21:26 - see my little hashtag name it just
21:28 - seemed like this was the most
21:29 - feature-rich and looked like the most
21:31 - amount of work went into this project at
21:33 - least for me i also like the fact that i
21:35 - can read the book directly online
21:37 - there's a lot of features here and more
21:39 - than i originally found so i apologized
21:41 - during the demo i didn't see all of this
21:43 - but thank god i looked at it again
21:44 - because obviously that would change my
21:46 - decision on where this should be ranked
21:47 - so congratulations guys on first place
21:50 - now last thing i will say for these last
21:52 - two projects here you guys did an
21:53 - awesome job in fact almost all of the
21:55 - projects i saw were really really well
21:57 - done please don't be discouraged you
21:59 - came fourth fifth uh the reason why
22:01 - these did not make it in the top three
22:03 - was just simple stuff like this right i
22:04 - feel like there should be an image here
22:06 - this fine flights feature didn't work it
22:08 - was just didn't feel polished didn't
22:10 - feel finished and even though it might
22:12 - have had some more impressive features
22:13 - than some of the other projects as soon
22:15 - as you throw something in there that
22:16 - doesn't work or is broken that
22:18 - immediately kind of you know ruins the
22:20 - reputation of the project if that makes
22:22 - any sense and please take that as
22:23 - feedback i'm not trying to dis or roast
22:24 - your project just trying to help you
22:26 - improve for the future looking at this
22:28 - one here this one was well done as well
22:30 - i just thought it was pretty simple some
22:32 - of the other projects were a little bit
22:33 - more advanced had some more work that
22:34 - went into them and that's why i picked
22:36 - them but regardless you guys are saying
22:38 - you're only 14 years old so congrats on
22:40 - that that's really really impressive
22:42 - especially at that age
22:43 - all right so with that said i think i'm
22:45 - going to end the video here those three
22:48 - winning teams and the top two projects
22:50 - hosted on replit as well as i guess the
22:52 - fourth and fifth place team because
22:53 - they're getting replaced hacker plans i
22:55 - will reach out to you with information
22:56 - on how to claim your prize that will be
22:59 - through discord anyone who's watching
23:01 - this who wants to compete in future code
23:02 - gems join the discord server there'll be
23:04 - announcements and all kinds of
23:05 - information there you can ask the staff
23:07 - team you can ask other members and
23:09 - they'll tell you everything that you
23:10 - need to know all right i hope you guys
