00:00 - hey guys and welcome back so when
00:02 - today's PI QT 5 tutorial what we're
00:04 - gonna be doing is learning how to use
00:06 - this QT designer how to first of all
00:08 - open up this program run it install it
00:11 - and secondly how to actually transform
00:13 - whatever we created here into code that
00:15 - we can actually use play with and run so
00:18 - the first step is actually bringing up
00:20 - this design or window and making sure
00:22 - it's installed on our computer so to do
00:24 - this we're gonna go to our command
00:25 - prompt and we're gonna make sure that
00:27 - we've installed PI QT 5 tools now I did
00:31 - this in the previous video but if any of
00:32 - you weren't following along what you
00:33 - need to do to do this is just pip
00:35 - install PI QT 5 - tools you're gonna do
00:39 - this in whatever version of Python
00:40 - you're working with and now what we're
00:42 - actually gonna do is look for what's
00:45 - known as the site packages folder inside
00:48 - of our main Python folder so whenever
00:51 - you install python on your computer
00:52 - you're gonna have a directory that has
00:54 - python and all of the pip packages that
00:57 - you've installed and that's what it
00:58 - allows you to import them and use them
01:00 - and install them actually using pip so
01:03 - we need to find this folder now this can
01:06 - be kind of difficult and it depends it's
01:08 - gonna be different depending on what
01:09 - machine you're working with the first
01:11 - place i usually check if you don't know
01:12 - where your python is installed is in
01:14 - this program files x86 scroll through
01:17 - look for PE look for python if you see
01:19 - it there you see python 3 6 whatever it
01:21 - is click into there click into the lib
01:24 - folder and then click into the cite
01:27 - packages folder now if for some reason
01:29 - you can't find it there what you can
01:31 - always do is just do a python search
01:33 - through your entire c drive so just make
01:36 - sure you're in that root directory so
01:37 - the c drive search for python wait for
01:40 - the search results to finish and then it
01:41 - should show you where that folder is now
01:44 - for me i actually know where my python
01:46 - folder is and i'm using a version of
01:49 - Python called anaconda so for me mine is
01:51 - in users my user name which is Tim OTT
01:53 - and then anaconda 3 so some of this
01:56 - might apply to some of you guys if
01:57 - you're using anaconda and then you can
01:59 - see here that there's this Lib folder
02:01 - and this Lib folder is what you guys are
02:03 - aiming to find so you can also search
02:05 - Lib but there's a bunch of different Lib
02:06 - folders for different applications so
02:08 - that's why I don't usually recommend
02:09 - that and then from Lib we're gonna be
02:12 - looking for site
02:13 - packages now again you can also search
02:15 - for the site packages folder up here if
02:17 - you're not having any luck finding the
02:18 - Python folder and once you get into that
02:20 - site packages folder now you're gonna
02:23 - scroll through and you're gonna see
02:24 - these are all of the different packages
02:25 - that you've actually installed into pip
02:28 - some of them are dependencies of others
02:30 - you're gonna scroll down and we're gonna
02:31 - look for PI QT 5 tools I'm gonna keep
02:35 - going here I have a lot of packages I'm
02:37 - if you can't tell and look for pi QT 5
02:41 - wherever that is and then tools so PI QT
02:45 - 5 underscore tools I guess you could
02:46 - also search for that folder as well it
02:48 - will just take a long time to find it
02:49 - once we're inside of here what we're
02:52 - gonna do is look for this designer
02:54 - application it shows the little cutie
02:56 - icon and it shows up right here now the
02:59 - first thing I'm gonna do because I don't
03:01 - wanna have to go through this process
03:02 - every time I want to open up this
03:03 - designer is just create a shortcut so to
03:06 - do that I'm gonna right-click and I'm
03:07 - gonna go to create shortcut like that
03:11 - now it's gonna pop up a shortcut for me
03:13 - like that and I'm just gonna drag it to
03:14 - my desktop or summer where I'm not gonna
03:17 - lose it now I have a I've already got
03:18 - one there but I'll just override that
03:20 - and now I have a shortcut to Qt designer
03:22 - and we're ready to start using it quick
03:25 - sidenote here if you are not finding
03:27 - this in anaconda it might be because
03:29 - you're using a virtual environment so go
03:31 - inside this en B's folder look through
03:33 - your virtual environment and then you'll
03:34 - be able to open it and run it okay so
03:38 - next we are actually going to run this
03:40 - now and start playing with QT designer
03:42 - so we're gonna open this up here and the
03:44 - first thing we need to do is select what
03:46 - we want to create now typically what
03:49 - we're going to be doing is selecting a
03:50 - main window or a widget now a main
03:53 - window is what it says is that main
03:55 - window similar to what we created in the
03:57 - last video a widget will be something
03:59 - that we can place inside of the main
04:00 - window so sometimes if you already have
04:02 - a main window and you want to create a
04:04 - widget then maybe you'll place somewhere
04:06 - inside of it then you would choose
04:07 - widget but in our case since we're just
04:09 - starting out here we don't already have
04:10 - anything we're gonna use main window now
04:13 - for screen size you can select whatever
04:15 - you'd like I'm just gonna do default
04:16 - size and then go ahead and hit create
04:18 - and now what I can do is start by
04:22 - resizing this window and I can start
04:25 - dragging and dropping things into here
04:27 - like I showed you in that very first
04:28 - tutorial so let's say I want to add a
04:31 - push button somewhere I go ahead and do
04:33 - that and just throw my push button right
04:34 - there I can make it bigger I can make it
04:37 - smaller I can do whatever I like with it
04:38 - I can add some maybe check buttons again
04:42 - resize that resize those really it
04:45 - doesn't matter now I'm not gonna show
04:47 - too much of this right now because we
04:48 - are gonna work with this more in the
04:50 - future and create actual applications
04:52 - and use layouts which will actually be
04:53 - in the next video but what I'm gonna do
04:55 - for now is just create a button and a
04:57 - label and I'm gonna show you how we can
04:59 - actually turn this button in this label
05:01 - that we've created here into code that
05:03 - we can actually use so for this label
05:05 - you all I've done to modify this is just
05:07 - double click I was gonna say hello my
05:09 - name is Tim now for this push button
05:12 - same thing I want to modify it I double
05:15 - click and now I can change this button
05:18 - to say something like press me now the
05:21 - first thing we're gonna want to do
05:22 - whenever we're create some kind of
05:24 - objects in here is we want to change
05:25 - their object name and the object name is
05:28 - gonna be how we actually reference these
05:30 - objects from the code so for example
05:32 - this button here right now it defaults
05:34 - to the value of push button but that's
05:37 - not very useful to us so what I want to
05:38 - do is change this to be button 1
05:41 - something like that ok now the label
05:43 - same thing the name is label now for us
05:46 - maybe that's ok we want to keep text we
05:48 - only have one label but in this case I'm
05:50 - just gonna make it label 1 in case we
05:52 - add any other ones now you guys can see
05:54 - there's a ton of different options on
05:56 - this right bar here and this is what's
05:57 - known as the property editor that you
05:59 - can mess with you can change and you can
06:03 - change the background to do whatever you
06:05 - want you know all that kind of stuff
06:06 - I'll let you guys play around with that
06:08 - you can change the font size here how
06:11 - big everything is very useful and up
06:14 - here is what's known as the object
06:16 - inspector so on this right-hand side of
06:17 - my screen now this is useful because you
06:20 - can actually see what all of the
06:23 - different items you have are and where
06:25 - they sit so for example the menu bar
06:27 - which is up here and I can modify it by
06:29 - double clicking and maybe add file or
06:31 - something like that and you see when I
06:33 - do that it actually asked me if I want
06:35 - to type something else in this menu bar
06:36 - as well which I'm not going to do right
06:38 - now and now if we look here you can see
06:40 - menu
06:41 - our menu file cue menu and it kind of
06:43 - goes through everything that we have so
06:46 - let you guys play around with this and
06:48 - add some different objects and but we
06:50 - will be talking about these throughout
06:51 - the future tutorials but for right now
06:53 - I'm just gonna go ahead and save this
06:55 - and it saves these files as a dot UI
06:58 - file now a UI file is gonna be what
07:00 - we're gonna use to actually transform
07:02 - this into code so what I'm gonna do is
07:04 - just save this into my tutorial folder
07:05 - which I believe is somewhere here maybe
07:10 - I'm in the wrong one um one second guys
07:14 - I think I passed by there it is so I'm
07:17 - gonna save this as test and just go
07:19 - ahead and hit save and make sure you
07:21 - know where you save this file because we
07:23 - need to use this to actually turn this
07:25 - into code now a quick side note here if
07:27 - you actually want to view what this
07:29 - looks like and um in like a real window
07:32 - I believe what you can do is go to form
07:34 - and then go to preview and what will
07:36 - this will do is pop this up so you can
07:38 - actually see how it looks without kind
07:40 - of that little grid behind it obviously
07:43 - no logic is gonna work cuz it's just a
07:45 - what do you call it a GUI but you get
07:48 - the idea there now to turn this into
07:50 - code I'm gonna show you how we can use a
07:52 - command line interface thing to do this
07:55 - so I'm gonna navigate back into that
07:57 - folder where I save this so I gotta find
07:59 - that so Python YouTube pie cutie
08:03 - tutorial and this is the folder the file
08:05 - I just created so test out UI now I'm
08:08 - just gonna open the command prompt up
08:09 - here and I'm going to type a command
08:11 - that is gonna turn this UI file into a
08:13 - python file for me so it's gonna take
08:15 - all the code generate it for me and then
08:19 - allow me to actually see it and edit it
08:20 - so to do this what we're gonna use is PI
08:24 - UIC 5 so start by making sure that this
08:27 - command works by just hitting Enter and
08:29 - if you get some kind of output whether
08:30 - it's an error like this it says one
08:33 - input UI file must be set specified then
08:36 - it's working properly so we're gonna do
08:39 - PI UIC 5 - X which stands for executable
08:44 - and then we're gonna type the name of
08:45 - our UI file so what we want to transform
08:48 - into code so in this case test our UI
08:50 - and remember that this command prompt
08:53 - window that I just opened is
08:54 - the inside of this directory so make
08:57 - sure that you're inside the correct
08:58 - directory with your command prompt you
09:00 - can simply open it by just typing CMD in
09:02 - the top bar of your Windows Explorer and
09:04 - it'll automatically open it in that
09:06 - directory and you can test by just
09:07 - having a look here
09:08 - okay so we're new PI UIC - five test out
09:12 - UI - o which stands for output file and
09:16 - then the name of the python file you
09:18 - want to save it to so in this case maybe
09:19 - we'll just do test dot PI I'm gonna go
09:23 - go ahead and hit enter if you don't get
09:25 - any output that actually means that this
09:27 - worked properly and to verify we can
09:29 - look and see that we now have this test
09:31 - dot PI file in our main directory so
09:35 - let's go ahead and actually open this up
09:36 - so I'm just gonna open this up in
09:38 - subline text like that and now you can
09:41 - see that we actually get the code that
09:44 - generated this for us
09:45 - and if I go ahead and run this you can
09:47 - see that it pops up that same window
09:49 - that we created before so with this code
09:51 - now we can do everything that we've done
09:53 - in this other code file which was the
09:55 - last one we were working with and we can
09:57 - mess with things we can link things to
09:58 - the button and all of that so with that
10:02 - being said that is how you kind of use
10:04 - the Qt designer how you get the code to
10:07 - actually pop up and run obviously this
10:10 - is a little bit messy and maybe you want
10:12 - to modify it and change it a bit but you
10:14 - can see that you know button one is the
10:16 - name of that button that we created it
10:18 - has the name button 1 you can see label
10:21 - 1 same thing set object name label 1 and
10:24 - then we have that main window the menu
10:26 - bar that we created and a status bar as
10:28 - well which we don't really see but he's
10:31 - actually there so if we want to create
10:32 - on like a button link create a method
10:34 - you can link that to the button up here
10:37 - like you've done before and all is good
10:39 - so with that being said that has been it
10:41 - for this video I hope you guys have an
10:42 - idea how to use QT designer and got it
10:45 - up and running alright if you have any
10:46 - questions as always let me know down
10:48 - below or join my discord server with
10:50 - that being said I will see you guys in
10:51 - another video
