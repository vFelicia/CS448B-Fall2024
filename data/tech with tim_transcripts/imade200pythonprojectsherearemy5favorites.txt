00:00 - I've made over 200 python projects and
00:03 - today I'm going to share with you my
00:04 - favorites now I've got five projects to
00:06 - demo for you here and the best part is
00:08 - none of these are super complicated
00:10 - which means you could code them out in
00:12 - just a few days if you've got some
00:14 - experience with python now I hope you
00:16 - take this video's inspiration and make
00:17 - sure you stick around into the last
00:19 - project because I do have a surprise I
00:20 - want to share with you but first let me
00:22 - tell you about a way that you can code
00:24 - these projects out faster and that's by
00:26 - using bubble the sponsor of this video
00:28 - and the world's first full stack no code
00:31 - production grade platform bubble is
00:34 - programming anything that can be built
00:36 - with code can be built faster using
00:38 - bubble with bubble you have everything
00:39 - you need to build real world apps from
00:41 - design data and logic this means you can
00:43 - rapidly build visually captivating
00:45 - robust and responsive apps while
00:47 - integrating with databases and
00:49 - functionality like user authentication
00:51 - checkout experiences and social
00:53 - networking features if you don't believe
00:55 - me you can check out these full guides
00:57 - that walk you through building entire
00:58 - apps like an Instagram clone an nft
01:01 - Marketplace a budgeting app a udemy
01:03 - clone and tons of others you can start
01:05 - building your first app in a matter of
01:07 - minutes by working through one of these
01:08 - projects or by checking out these
01:10 - interactive lessons who knows maybe
01:12 - you'll even end up building an entire
01:14 - company going from prototype to IPO to a
01:16 - successful business like tons of others
01:19 - already have using bubble bubble
01:21 - supports everyone from Individual
01:22 - developers to Fortune 500 companies and
01:25 - you can get started with them today by
01:27 - clicking the link in the description so
01:29 - let's get into into the demo and I want
01:30 - to remind you that the projects I'm
01:32 - showing you here are my favorite ones
01:34 - the ones I had the most fun building
01:35 - that I can remember today not
01:37 - necessarily the most impressive ones the
01:39 - ones I would put on something like a
01:40 - resume these projects were really what
01:42 - got me into coding and got me really
01:44 - excited and passionate and that's why
01:46 - I'm sharing them with you here so the
01:48 - first one that I have is called super
01:49 - mini golf and this was my grade 12 final
01:52 - project in my computer science class now
01:55 - the idea here was we had to make some
01:57 - kind of game in Python using pame which
01:59 - to to date is still my favorite module
02:01 - that I just love making games in so I
02:03 - made a game that I used to play on my
02:04 - phone all the time which was Super
02:06 - Stickman Golf so I pretty much just
02:07 - remade this in P game you can see that
02:10 - there's like sand traps there's water
02:12 - hazards you can uh shoot the ball that
02:14 - was a gray one there there's some
02:15 - powerups that I'll show you this was a
02:17 - really hard game for me to make back
02:19 - when I was how old would I've been here
02:21 - 17 18 years old it took me a really long
02:24 - time but it was one of the most fun
02:25 - times I've ever had and I've shown this
02:27 - project to so many people and it was
02:28 - something that I was really really proud
02:30 - of uh back in the
02:38 - day all right so I've just wrapped up
02:40 - the game here you can see it didn't go
02:41 - so well after the first few holes that I
02:43 - was actually recording uh but you guys
02:45 - get the idea here and I also implemented
02:47 - like a little ball shop thing where you
02:48 - could purchase different colored balls
02:49 - and equip them pretty cool so anyways
02:52 - that's first game or first project let's
02:54 - go to the next one so the next project
02:57 - is online multiplayer chess and this
02:59 - this is something I made during an
03:01 - 18-hour coding live stream on this
03:04 - channel this is really what brought my
03:06 - channel to the next level it's what got
03:07 - me a bunch of views a bunch of you found
03:09 - me because of this game and it's what
03:11 - really pushed me to keep making YouTube
03:12 - videos and coding so this is one of my
03:14 - favorite projects of all time it is far
03:16 - from polish and if I was going to remake
03:17 - it today it would be significantly
03:19 - better but I still love it and I want to
03:20 - show it to you guys so it's online chess
03:22 - game pretty straightforward you can join
03:24 - with two different clients ignore the
03:26 - fonts all being off but that's just how
03:29 - it was uh one person is white one person
03:31 - is black and when you make a move it
03:32 - will adjust on the other person you can
03:34 - see we have 50 minute timers going by
03:36 - default so on white here I can make my
03:38 - move then we give it a second and we'll
03:40 - see the move updates on the other board
03:42 - you can see the server on the bottom
03:44 - leftand corner here so here let's make
03:46 - our move on BL okay you see it updates
03:49 - there maybe we could play the English
03:51 - opening and I'll just get to a stage
03:52 - where we can like capture a piece so we
03:54 - can check that that is indeed working
03:57 - okay so let's go here
04:00 - fun fact this is the opening I usually
04:02 - play and then let's just test this out
04:04 - and make sure the piece capture does
04:05 - actually work you can see it does we can
04:08 - capture back and even rules like
04:10 - castling all that kind of stuff is
04:11 - implemented in here and yeah it's quite
04:13 - fun at one point I actually ran a live
04:15 - stream where I had you guys all play
04:17 - this game and I actually hosted the
04:19 - server like in like a real virtual
04:21 - private server so you guys could all
04:22 - connect I don't know how well that
04:24 - worked when I'm thinking back to it I
04:25 - think there was quite a few bugs but it
04:27 - was cool to see you guys actually on
04:28 - there playing my game and yeah this is
04:30 - one of the first online things I made it
04:32 - was really really fun and now let's move
04:34 - on to the next project so the next
04:36 - project I have for you here is a sodoku
04:39 - solver now the first reason I remember
04:41 - this project so much is because I put it
04:42 - on my YouTube channel and so many of you
04:44 - guys made fun of the way that I say that
04:46 - word I still don't know what the correct
04:48 - pronunciation is if I'm saying it right
04:50 - if you guys are wrong so you can let me
04:51 - know in the comments but the idea is you
04:53 - can just play a normal game of soku here
04:56 - so what I can do is try to pencil in a
04:57 - number so let's say I think one goes
04:59 - here I can go ahead and hit enter and if
05:01 - it doesn't conflict with anything it
05:02 - will let me actually put that in now if
05:05 - I try to put another one here you see
05:06 - that I actually gives me an X and tells
05:08 - me hey that's wrong you can't actually
05:10 - put that number there and then let's say
05:12 - I go through maybe I pencil in a few
05:14 - different numbers I think you know three
05:15 - or four goes here five seven whatever
05:18 - like a normal game and then at some
05:20 - point I say you know what I don't want
05:21 - to solve this anymore let's have the
05:22 - computer do it and I can go ahead and
05:25 - hit the space bar and it will
05:26 - automatically solve the board for me now
05:29 - it does this using a backtracking
05:31 - algorithm it's really interesting how
05:33 - that works and I had a lot of fun
05:34 - building up this project because it was
05:36 - super visual it actually shows you
05:38 - exactly what's going on and how the
05:39 - computer is solving this board and I
05:42 - just found it really fun and it was
05:43 - something that again taught me quite a
05:44 - bit about algorithms wanted to share it
05:46 - with you here if you want to check it
05:47 - out I'll leave the code link to it in
05:49 - the description so moving on to the next
05:51 - project this one is definitely the most
05:53 - practical but it requires a little bit
05:54 - of context to understand it so a long
05:57 - time ago I used to work at a summer camp
05:58 - this was a sports camp and we had a
06:00 - bunch of different groups so maybe we'd
06:02 - have 200 300 kids and they'd be split
06:05 - into seven eight groups Etc something
06:07 - along those lines okay now each of those
06:09 - groups would go throughout the day and
06:11 - at set kind of time periods just like
06:13 - school they would go and play some kind
06:15 - of activities they might do soccer they
06:17 - might do lacrosse football it was a
06:19 - sports camp so all the different groups
06:20 - went and eventually throughout the week
06:22 - they'd want to play you know every
06:24 - single one of the different activities
06:25 - that existed and sometimes they'd play
06:27 - it two times three times Etc the problem
06:30 - is that no two groups can be playing the
06:32 - same thing at the same time because of
06:35 - equipment constraints Etc so we had some
06:38 - office staff at the camp where every
06:40 - week they would have to go and create a
06:42 - schedule that looks something like this
06:44 - for every single one of the groups
06:46 - depending on how many there were they
06:47 - have to fill in all the different
06:48 - activities and they need to make sure
06:50 - there's no conflicts so that there's not
06:52 - one group playing you know tennis well
06:54 - another one's supposed to be playing
06:55 - tennis then they have to do things like
06:56 - move around the lunches move around when
06:58 - they're swimming there's just all these
07:00 - different things that uh are happening
07:02 - pretty much and it's very difficult to
07:03 - create these schedules because of the
07:05 - number of constraints so what I did for
07:07 - them is I kind of asked them let me just
07:09 - delete this here to explain to me how
07:12 - this system worked and then I wrote out
07:14 - a program that actually went and
07:16 - generated these schedules for them so
07:18 - this is what the UI of the program
07:19 - looked like it's super basic but the
07:21 - idea is you can go in and you can select
07:23 - what period the lunch and the swim is
07:25 - going to be for all of the different
07:26 - groups and then you put in the number of
07:29 - groups and then any of the activities
07:31 - now some weeks maybe soccer is not
07:33 - available or basketball's not available
07:35 - or whatever so you deselect those right
07:37 - and then you can choose what week you
07:38 - want to generate it for so maybe this is
07:39 - week two and I can put in something like
07:42 - six groups hit generate schedule and
07:44 - then what it will do is automatically
07:46 - generate a schedule that has no uh
07:48 - conflictions that they can then go
07:50 - review edit modify and use now this
07:53 - saved them literally hours of work every
07:55 - single week because before they
07:57 - literally had like sticky notes out
08:00 - pretty much and they had like eight
08:01 - different sheets which were the mock
08:03 - schedules and they'd go around and they
08:04 - were like he does group two have this
08:06 - does group three have this and they were
08:07 - manually doing what I wrote this code to
08:09 - do in just a few seconds so you can see
08:11 - that when I click that it generates a
08:13 - new schedule here now I'm on windows so
08:14 - it looks a little bit funky when I open
08:16 - it up but if I click here we have the
08:18 - week 2 schedules and then it gives us a
08:20 - schedule where it's kind of filled in
08:22 - all of the different activities uh and
08:24 - yeah it just made it so that now they
08:26 - don't have to do that and obviously they
08:27 - can go and modify this but it saved them
08:29 - a ton of time they loved it I loved
08:32 - creating it cuz it was actually a really
08:33 - useful project and the way I did this
08:35 - was actually using backtracking as well
08:37 - it's kind of a fancy algorithm where you
08:39 - can go and you can just check all of the
08:41 - different possible schedules you could
08:43 - create based on a set of constraints and
08:46 - I actually made this using something
08:47 - called Pi qt5 uh which is a UI library
08:51 - in Python which is pretty basic which
08:53 - lets you set up something like this
08:54 - right where we have like all these input
08:56 - boxes check Boxes Etc so yeah that's
08:59 - pretty much it for project 4 but wanted
09:01 - to share with you because this is a real
09:02 - useful project something that you guys
09:04 - might be able to come up with based on
09:05 - different use cases you have and
09:07 - actually saved a ton of time and with
09:09 - some pretty valuable software so we move
09:11 - on to project number five but first I do
09:13 - want to share with you that surprise
09:15 - that I promised now that is that I
09:17 - recently started a completely free
09:19 - school Community this is a place where
09:21 - you can network with other programmers
09:22 - you can talk with me we have some free
09:24 - courses in there that you can watch
09:26 - there's a bunch of valuable information
09:28 - completely free no strings attached you
09:30 - can join from the link in the
09:31 - description and that's the surprise that
09:33 - I wanted to share with you now that
09:35 - leads me into project number five which
09:37 - is a tower defense game built in Python
09:40 - now unfortunately I don't still have
09:41 - access to the source code for that
09:43 - project but I'll run some videos on this
09:45 - screen so you guys can see what it
09:46 - looked like now I coded this out during
09:48 - a 12-hour coding live stream on my
09:50 - channel it was a lot of fun to make I
09:52 - personally Love Games as you guys can
09:54 - probably tell from this video I used to
09:56 - always play Tower Defense games like
09:58 - balloon Power Defense 3 4 5 Etc so I
10:01 - wanted to make something like that in
10:03 - code in Python so that's what I did we
10:05 - had different enemies we had bosses we
10:07 - had different Health we had towers that
10:09 - you could upgrade that you could change
10:10 - the radius for we had like assisted
10:13 - Towers I had this whole UI library with
10:15 - different assets that looked really
10:17 - really cool there was some funky music
10:19 - in the background and I just had a lot
10:20 - of fun coding this project out it was
10:22 - also sufficiently difficult and it was
10:25 - fun to kind of problem solve and figure
10:27 - out okay how are we going to move the
10:28 - enemies how the towers going to look
10:30 - like they're animated and not attacking
10:31 - each other and there's a lot of fun
10:33 - challenges and just a really cool
10:34 - project to make so that guys is going to
10:37 - wrap up this video I know a lot of these
10:39 - projects are pretty simple but I just
10:40 - wanted to share with you five really fun
10:42 - projects that personally were my
10:44 - favorite now as I said these are not the
10:46 - best projects I've ever made they're not
10:47 - necessarily ones I would put on my
10:49 - resume but I just really enjoyed them
10:51 - they're ones that I did purely because I
10:53 - wanted to do them and not because I was
10:55 - trying to grind some project or learn
10:57 - data structures and algorithms they were
10:59 - just fun they were useful and that's
11:01 - what really got my passion going in
11:03 - coding and I want to encourage you to do
11:05 - the same thing so let me know the
11:06 - projects that you guys are working on in
11:07 - the comments down below make sure you
11:09 - join that free school community and I
11:11 - will see you in another YouTube
11:14 - [Music]
