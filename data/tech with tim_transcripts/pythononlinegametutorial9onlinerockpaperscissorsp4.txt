00:00 - so remember we're obviously we don't
00:01 - want to show the other player what one
00:05 - of the players moves is unless both of
00:06 - them have gone it's like we want to know
00:07 - what our move is but we can't know what
00:09 - the other players move us until we've
00:11 - both made a move so to do this we're
00:13 - gonna do we're gonna start by just
00:15 - getting both player moves we're gonna
00:17 - say game don't get underscore player
00:20 - underscore move we're gonna get move
00:23 - zero and actually we'll copy this and
00:26 - just do move to and change this to one
00:29 - so let's start by getting the moves and
00:31 - then now we're gonna check if we should
00:34 - show those moves if we should show
00:35 - waiting we're if we should show locked
00:37 - in okay so to do this we're and say if
00:39 - game dot both went okay like that we're
00:44 - gonna say is gonna say at x1 equals font
00:47 - render and we're just gonna use the same
00:49 - font as before and what its gonna be is
00:53 - move 1 comma 1 comma and we'll make this
00:57 - black so 0 0 0 okay and we'll copy this
01:00 - and we'll do the same thing except x2 is
01:03 - gonna be equal to move to so essentially
01:06 - this is saying if both of the players
01:08 - have gone well we can show their moves
01:10 - cuz they both made them so let's do that
01:11 - and it's just rendering that font and
01:13 - will display the font after you see it
01:15 - works so now otherwise if both players
01:17 - have not gone what we need to do is we
01:20 - need to actually let me just check
01:21 - something for a second is we need to
01:23 - determine if we're gonna show locked in
01:25 - meaning the other player actually has
01:27 - gone but we're not gonna show their move
01:28 - or if we're going to show waiting which
01:30 - means the other player hasn't gone so to
01:31 - do this we're gonna say if game dot p1
01:35 - went and P equals equals 0 so this is
01:39 - saying if we have gone and it's our
01:43 - current like we are the player we're
01:46 - player 1 so if player 1 is gone and we
01:47 - are player 1 what we're gonna do is
01:49 - going to say x 1 equals font dot render
01:53 - move 1 which is a move we've done which
01:55 - is fine if we see that and then we're
01:57 - gonna say 1 and color 0 0 0 okay L if
02:02 - game dot p2 went and is this one it is
02:08 - actually sorry game dot p1 went you guys
02:13 - will see how this works
02:14 - what we're gonna say and I say text 2
02:17 - equals the same thing now this might be
02:20 - confusing but essentially what this is
02:21 - doing is it's saying if player 1 is gone
02:24 - and we are player 1 we're gonna say if I
02:28 - spelled render correctly render like
02:31 - that render sorry I got interrupted
02:34 - there okay so if player 1 is gone and we
02:36 - are player 1 then we want to show
02:38 - underneath like you were move with our
02:40 - move is otherwise what we want to show
02:43 - is we want to show that like locked in
02:46 - so we're gonna change this to locked in
02:48 - underneath opponents move because it
02:50 - means player 1 went but it's not us so
02:52 - it's not our move
02:53 - so that means we want to show it under
02:55 - opponents moves you'll see how this
02:56 - works we're gonna say locked in like
02:59 - that okay all right now we're just gonna
03:01 - do else so this actually just stands for
03:04 - if game v1 hasn't like if they haven't
03:08 - moved yet we're gonna just going to say
03:09 - text 2 equals waiting so we say waiting
03:18 - dr. doe I believe that's correct
03:22 - umm actually sorry these all need to be
03:24 - text 1 by man ok all right
03:27 - I know this is confusing but we'll go
03:29 - through adapter all right so we're gonna
03:30 - actually copy this and we're just gonna
03:32 - change everything to 2 so this is gonna
03:34 - be p2 this is gonna be 1 this is gonna
03:38 - be - it's gonna be - and it's gonna be 2
03:40 - and this is gonna be 2 as well and then
03:42 - we just make sure that I did that
03:44 - correctly I believe I did ok sweet and
03:47 - now we are going to actually show these
03:50 - we're gonna let these on the screen
03:51 - we're actually really close to finish
03:52 - guys so to do this we're gonna say if P
03:56 - equals equals 1 so a for player 1 will
03:59 - do is say wind-up lit and we'll say text
04:02 - 2 and then we're gonna show it we're
04:04 - gonna show it at a hundred and 350 okay
04:08 - now we'll copy this so ctrl D and we'll
04:11 - blitt one except instead about a hundred
04:14 - we're gonna change this to 400 now we're
04:16 - just gonna put an else so if we're not
04:17 - player 1 clearly we must be player 0 so
04:21 - we're just going to reverse these player
04:22 - 1 player 2 now the reason we're doing
04:25 - is because this is gonna be where like
04:28 - player one and player two's moves are
04:30 - shown on the screen
04:31 - so we want it to make so that for each
04:33 - of our clients rather than saying like
04:36 - player 1 player 2 and having one of the
04:37 - clients have their move on the right
04:39 - side and one of them Abbott on the left
04:40 - side we want it to be the same for each
04:42 - client you guys will see how this works
04:44 - when we actually run the thing so let's
04:46 - actually just uh let's add in drawing
04:48 - the buttons so to draw the buttons we
04:50 - could we could draw them in this else
04:53 - statement actually that might be better
04:55 - yeah let's do it inside of this this
04:56 - else okay we're gonna say for BTN in
05:00 - buttons we're just gonna say BTN draw
05:04 - and give it a win and I think that's
05:06 - actually all we need to do and lastly
05:08 - we're just gonna update the display so
05:10 - Prime dots play update now assuming I
05:15 - didn't make any critical errors this
05:17 - should actually be working so I know
05:19 - this has been a lot of code and a lot of
05:21 - writing but I think I've kept it to just
05:22 - about an hour now actually and that's
05:25 - actually pretty decent time for creating
05:26 - a game like this so you guys will see
05:28 - how this works out okay so let's try
05:30 - running our server and see if we got any
05:32 - errors first off okay server waiting for
05:35 - a connection service started good sign
05:36 - so far ok clients let's try running a
05:39 - client so I'm going to client Oh name P
05:42 - is not defined when game P ah ok so what
05:45 - we're gonna do for client this is a
05:46 - really easy fix just change this to
05:48 - player and I might have to change oh
05:51 - yeah up here when I do redraw game
05:54 - window as well to go do win game and
05:58 - player ok so fix that alright client run
06:01 - waiting for player alright good sign
06:03 - it's around another one and would you
06:06 - look at that ok they both launch it now
06:07 - so you saw that waiting for player
06:09 - showed up but as soon as we are ready
06:10 - now both of them are showing up ok so
06:13 - this should be player 1 this should be
06:15 - player 0 or player player 1 player 2
06:19 - right okay so let's try this now rock I
06:21 - ran out of input self client I receive
06:24 - 2048 okay so let just have a quick look
06:26 - at why this might be ah so I think I
06:30 - might've fine found the issue I'm
06:31 - actually I don't know if this is the
06:33 - issue exactly but we do need to fix this
06:34 - where I do game dot reset inside of
06:38 - server here it actually just be
06:39 - set went because that's what I called it
06:41 - inside here reset went so she's got make
06:43 - sure we do that okay guys so really
06:45 - silly error here actually um the issue
06:47 - was on the server side here I'm calling
06:50 - play right like game dot play and so if
06:53 - actually I need to get rid of six I was
06:55 - just printing out the exception so I can
06:56 - see what it was but essentially play
06:59 - doesn't actually exist because I
07:00 - misspelled something on game
07:02 - I miss spelt it and misspelled the
07:04 - player should be play so that was the
07:06 - issue I was running into it just it was
07:08 - very difficult to see because it was
07:09 - just accepting it and not like not
07:12 - printing anything out just continuing to
07:13 - run the server so I couldn't find it but
07:16 - essentially if we run the server and we
07:17 - run the two clients now we should have
07:20 - everything working I haven't actually
07:22 - tested it so let's pray if I go paper
07:24 - suite so he goes paper here we're not
07:26 - getting locked in over here so that
07:28 - might be an issue but see if we make
07:30 - something here then offense you lost and
07:32 - you won okay so we have a slight issue
07:34 - but it's pretty easy fix
07:36 - let's just go up to client just look
07:39 - through we're just probably messing
07:40 - something up in the drawing code here so
07:42 - oh that would make sense well we're not
07:45 - actually end up drawing yeah so this if
07:47 - P equals equals one this just needs to
07:49 - top back one one indentation level and
07:52 - that we should have everything actually
07:54 - working fine so let's try this now
07:57 - client client and let's go rock okay so
08:03 - that works but it's not doing the locked
08:05 - in for some reason so let's check this
08:07 - this locked in portion I just closed
08:10 - that server and make sure that this is
08:12 - actually working so that needs to be p2
08:15 - went and well if this one should be
08:19 - working those what's confusing okay so
08:22 - actually so that one just need to be p2
08:24 - went game p2 went let's try this server
08:28 - and let's go client and let's ride again
08:32 - and scissors locked in sweet so that's
08:36 - actually working and the game is pretty
08:38 - well finished all we got to do is out a
08:39 - menu screen and we're gonna be done so
08:41 - now let's go scissors this is a scissors
08:43 - scissors that's not correct we got to
08:47 - fix that as well okay
08:48 - I thought I had everything working guys
08:51 - I really thought so okay so I actually I
08:54 - do I do know the issue it was it's
08:56 - pretty straightforward so in main here
08:58 - when we check the let's see here the
09:01 - winners where do we check winners if it
09:04 - equals equals 1 because equals negative
09:06 - 1
09:07 - ah okay so game don't winner needs
09:09 - brackets of course it does so we need to
09:14 - add that so obviously just some silly
09:16 - Aires guys so server's running right now
09:17 - let's run these clients see if
09:19 - everything is indeed working as it's
09:22 - supposed to be now okay so let's try
09:24 - this paper locked in scissors you lost
09:27 - you won yay okay everything's working
09:29 - okay paper paper tie game
09:32 - sweet okay so you guys can all really
09:34 - mess around at the timing you can see
09:36 - how this is working so the only last
09:38 - thing to do now is watch this if I
09:40 - disconnect disconnects both of them so
09:42 - what we're gonna want to do now if that
09:44 - happens is instead of just completely
09:47 - like exiting the game we're gonna want
09:49 - to bring them to a menu screen where
09:50 - they can just click to reconnect and
09:52 - this is a really this actually really
09:54 - easy to do so what we're gonna do is
09:56 - we're gonna define another function I'm
09:58 - gonna call this menu underscore screen
10:00 - okay and in here all we're gonna do is
10:02 - have a really basic while loop that just
10:04 - checks if you click something and all
10:06 - it's gonna do there is click the run
10:08 - that main function so we're gonna do is
10:10 - just a run equals true or say well run
10:13 - okay and then in here we're gonna say
10:16 - for event in PI game the event dot gets
10:22 - and that obviously we're going to check
10:24 - if they click exit so if event type
10:26 - because he goes PI game dot quit then we
10:29 - will do is just do PI game don't quit
10:31 - Ron equals false otherwise if they click
10:35 - any key so let's say if event dot type
10:38 - equals equals PI game dot and we'll just
10:42 - say mouse button down so why should just
10:44 - get it they'll click the mouse button
10:45 - then what we'll do is we'll simply say
10:48 - Ron equals false and at the bottom of
10:52 - Ron equals false what we're gonna do is
10:53 - we're just gonna call main so all this
10:55 - is gonna do and we'll call
10:57 - menu under stores screen here so we said
11:00 - while true comma menu screen okay I
11:06 - won't go through this in a second or say
11:07 - while true menu screen okay so we're
11:09 - gonna do is in menu screen if they click
11:13 - something we're gonna call the main
11:15 - function which is simply going to what
11:19 - do you call it do all of this stuff in
11:21 - here and then if they exit out of the
11:24 - main function so if you say like Ron
11:25 - equals false because they disconnected
11:28 - it'll just rerun the menu screen which
11:30 - means that they'll be prompted to
11:31 - reconnect to new game awesome what we'll
11:35 - do in here is a lot of clock as well so
11:37 - say Clark equals PI game dot time
11:42 - o'clock give it a tick so clock dot tick
11:46 - sixty will do will just draw something
11:49 - in here we don't need to use the redraw
11:51 - window function we'll just do font
11:54 - equals PI game dot font dot s why is
12:00 - font in here we'll do go Comic Sans will
12:05 - go sixty and then we're just gonna
12:07 - render some text will say text equals
12:09 - volunteer and ER in here will simply say
12:13 - click to connect our click to play
12:16 - exclamation point one some nice red text
12:20 - and we can just continually actually we
12:23 - can just window fill so wind fill and
12:26 - we'll just fill it with white suppose
12:29 - your zero or what I say gray actually
12:31 - 128 128 and we should just where is wind
12:35 - do i define it up here somewhere yes I
12:37 - do so that's sweet winds up there so
12:40 - what we can do is just fill the window
12:42 - run into this while loop put some text
12:45 - on the screen we may actually have to
12:47 - fill this every frame let's get rid of
12:51 - one of those brackets I created so let's
12:53 - fill this every frame actually
12:54 - okay so we'll fill it we will blitt this
12:57 - font so it's a wind blitz text and you
13:02 - know what for right now I don't want to
13:03 - deal will just do it statically we'll
13:05 - just do like 150 so it's night at the
13:07 - top of the screen actually let's go 100
13:09 - 200
13:10 - Ok Go my game don't display don't update
13:15 - like that then if they click something
13:18 - what should happen is that you break
13:20 - this loop they should be brought to you
13:23 - the main thing and yeah that should
13:25 - hopefully be working for us so let's try
13:27 - this client click to play ok a little a
13:31 - little sketchy on the click to play but
13:33 - let's see you if we click to play ok
13:34 - waiting for player so this is what
13:35 - actually what I wanted so it says
13:37 - waiting for player we're gonna wait for
13:38 - someone else to connect ok boom
13:40 - connected sweet so now we're ready so
13:42 - let's just run a game let's go rock
13:44 - scissors now let's just see what happens
13:46 - if we click X this one goes to the menu
13:49 - screen where it says click to play and
13:50 - it can be what he called play against
13:53 - someone else right and that's exactly
13:54 - what we wanted we may also want to add
13:56 - like a back button to go back but I'll
13:58 - leave that to you guys so guys I'm gonna
14:00 - leave the tutorial here if you guys have
14:02 - any questions or run into any bugs or
14:04 - anything please let me know this is by
14:05 - no means like a full complete game
14:07 - there's still obviously a lot of things
14:09 - that could be added to this and I might
14:10 - continue a serious later but I think for
14:12 - now that's probably enough I hope that
14:14 - you guys learned how to make an online
14:16 - game I find this stuff really freaking
14:18 - cool and really interesting how you can
14:20 - have like a ton of different clients
14:21 - connecting together you know if you guys
14:23 - want to play against me using this I'd
14:25 - be happy to put this on an external
14:27 - server release it maybe do a livestream
14:29 - where I play against some of you guys I
14:31 - think that'd be really interesting and
14:32 - cool and some of you mentioned that you
14:33 - might want to do that so with that being
14:34 - said if you guys enjoyed the series
14:36 - please consider subscribing to the
14:37 - channel and liking the video and that
14:39 - being said I'll see you guys in another
