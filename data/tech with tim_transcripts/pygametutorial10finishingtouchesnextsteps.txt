00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:02 - YouTube video so in today's video I'm
00:04 - going to be doing the tenth and final
00:06 - video in my PI game programming series
00:08 - or tutorials and in today's video we're
00:11 - gonna be talking about finishing up the
00:12 - game fixing a few bugs that I've
00:14 - discovered since the last video and that
00:16 - you guys have probably found as well if
00:17 - you've been running the program and
00:19 - we're gonna be talking about what the
00:20 - next steps are and what we can expect to
00:22 - see from here and where we can go after
00:24 - having knowledge that we've learned from
00:26 - this tutorial so first of all if you
00:28 - guys have made it all the way to video
00:29 - 10 and are watching this give yourself a
00:32 - pat on the back that's very impressive
00:33 - that you've been able to sit through 10
00:36 - 10 to 15 minute long videos and you've
00:40 - now created something that's pretty
00:41 - impressive as a first game or just a
00:44 - starter a project to start a learn high
00:47 - game so if you've been able to
00:49 - understand even just some of what I've
00:51 - shown in here then that's a really good
00:53 - sign and you guys are gonna be able to
00:54 - create more advanced games later on by
00:56 - following more tutorial guides so I'm
00:58 - gonna be doing so pretty much I'm just
01:00 - gonna start off right now by fixing a
01:03 - few bugs and I'll show those bugs to you
01:04 - right now and this is what happens when
01:06 - you're developing games so when you
01:09 - develop games you're gonna notice that
01:11 - you can't possibly think of every
01:13 - scenario that's gonna happen for example
01:15 - a bug that's in this game is while I'm
01:17 - jumping if I hit the Goblin you'll see
01:20 - that our character goes down below the
01:22 - screen now the first thing we need to do
01:23 - to fix this bug is to figure out why
01:25 - it's happening now the reason that this
01:26 - bug happens and it took me about a few
01:28 - minutes to figure it out is because
01:30 - while we're in midair
01:31 - what ends up happening is we run the
01:34 - player hit method here right which
01:37 - resets our Y to ground level so for 10
01:40 - now after we reset the y we don't stop
01:44 - jumping meaning that although our
01:46 - character doesn't appear as though they
01:48 - are moving downwards from jumping the
01:51 - jump code that we have in our while loop
01:53 - that moves our character downwards Hank
01:55 - it's like let's see here somewhere down
01:58 - here yeah so if man is jumping it's
02:00 - still moving our character downwards so
02:02 - we move it to 410 and then since we're
02:04 - still jumping we move down another like
02:06 - 50 pixels which makes our character head
02:08 - just barely visible at the bottom of the
02:10 - screen so the way to fix this
02:13 - just to go into our man dot hip method
02:16 - which is I believe right here and just
02:18 - at the very beginning we're gonna say
02:20 - self dot is jump is equal to false and
02:24 - I'm going to say self dot jump count I'm
02:28 - just gonna reset that to the original
02:29 - value which we had of ten I believe
02:31 - still would check that yep so jump count
02:34 - is 10 and is jump equal to false so this
02:37 - way it just got stopped our jump so that
02:40 - we shouldn't be going down so let's test
02:41 - this and just make sure that it's
02:42 - working alright just give me a second
02:46 - here so let's wait for them to come back
02:50 - jump up and there we go so you can see
02:55 - now our character does not go below the
02:57 - screen we'll test it one more time to
02:58 - make sure it's working and everything
03:00 - seems to be okay now another bug I ran
03:03 - into I'm gonna have to show you quickly
03:04 - here is once the Goblin disappears
03:07 - watch this I'm just gonna run around and
03:09 - you see it's still collides with the
03:11 - gulp and so although we can't see the
03:12 - gulp than he actually is running around
03:14 - right now he should hit me in just about
03:16 - a second now yeah because he's over
03:17 - there so we need to make sure that our
03:19 - character is not able to collide with
03:21 - the Goblin while the Goblin is well
03:24 - destroyed right so once we kill him
03:26 - obviously we don't want to still be able
03:28 - to collide with him because right now
03:29 - what what ends up happening is we just
03:33 - make the enemy invisible we don't
03:36 - actually like remove it from the screen
03:38 - so it's still moving around in the
03:39 - background we just can't see it so it's
03:42 - pretty easy to fix this we're just gonna
03:44 - go down to where we have the collision
03:45 - between our Goblin and our player and
03:47 - we're going to create another if loop up
03:50 - here if statement or just gonna say if
03:52 - goblin I believe that's what I called
03:54 - him yep thought visible equals equals
03:59 - true there we go we can indent all this
04:03 - just by hitting tabs that should work
04:06 - there we go
04:07 - and now it's only going to allow the
04:08 - collision between the two characters if
04:10 - the Goblin is visible now I'm just going
04:11 - to double check to make sure that is the
04:13 - property I used visible yes so now we
04:15 - can see if I around the program let's
04:17 - make sure this is working I'm just gonna
04:20 - oops just gotta make sure we kill this
04:24 - Galvin first and then we can see that
04:27 - now that the golden is invisible I can
04:29 - clearly run across the screen and I'm
04:31 - not no longer colliding with the gaulden
04:33 - because well we destroyed you right so
04:36 - that's a quick fix at a plug now the
04:37 - other bug I noticed was the score up
04:39 - here so once this becomes a negative
04:42 - number it starts to move off the screen
04:44 - now this is a really easy fix all I'm
04:46 - gonna do for this is simply just move
04:48 - where we're drawing the the text so if
04:50 - we go to our redraw game window function
04:53 - believe that's where we draw the text
04:54 - all I'm gonna do is just move it back
04:56 - and the X by a boat let's say like 40 50
05:00 - pixels maybe and now if we draw it and
05:03 - we get hit you can see that it's gonna
05:05 - say negative 5 and it's no longer going
05:09 - off the screen now you guys can play
05:11 - with that if you want to move it closer
05:12 - to the right close to the left
05:13 - etc and yeah so that's about it for the
05:17 - bugs that I found I'm sure there's
05:19 - probably a few more that you guys can
05:20 - think of for right now that's all we've
05:23 - got so now I'm just gonna go in and talk
05:26 - about next steps so pretty much the next
05:29 - steps for us and for this program is to
05:32 - now create a more original game or to
05:35 - create just better games in general so
05:38 - this was kind of not really a game more
05:40 - it's just a starter project just to kind
05:42 - of learn some of the different
05:43 - attributes of Pi game and how it works
05:45 - so how two objects can collide with each
05:48 - other how we can have sound effects play
05:50 - how we can have bullets shooting out of
05:53 - a character so I really tried to make it
05:55 - pretty diverse in the way that I showed
05:57 - well how to use a class how to use
05:59 - methods so that you guys if you wanted
06:01 - to create your own game you would have
06:03 - the tools to do so from just using this
06:07 - tutorial series that I've done here so
06:09 - that's why if you're looking at the game
06:10 - now you're kind of like well in 10
06:12 - videos we didn't really accomplish too
06:14 - much this isn't really a great game I
06:17 - don't want to show this to my friends
06:17 - whatever but all I'm trying to do here
06:20 - was just show you the different tools
06:21 - that you could use so what I'm gonna be
06:23 - doing on this channel is I'm going to be
06:25 - posting way more specific videos now so
06:27 - now that I have this general tutorial
06:29 - series done I think I'm going to be
06:30 - doing a video on for example how to code
06:32 - hi
06:33 - our pac-man in pagi how to code like a
06:37 - shooter game so like you know if you I'm
06:40 - not sure if you guys know the asteroid
06:41 - asteroids game I'm not sure what it's
06:43 - called you have a little plane that
06:44 - comes here and enemies shoot down and
06:46 - come down the screen and you have to
06:47 - shoot them before they hit you or the
06:48 - edge of the screen I'm gonna be showing
06:50 - how to do videos like that and then for
06:53 - all these videos what I'm going to be
06:54 - doing is I'm just gonna sit down and
06:56 - record them all in one sitting so I'll
06:57 - record like an hour hour and a half and
06:59 - then I'll break that up into two or
07:00 - three videos and I'll post them within a
07:03 - few days so that way unlike this series
07:05 - where you guys had to wait for a long
07:06 - time to see the videos they'll come out
07:08 - right away so you can follow along with
07:10 - them instantly so if you guys want to
07:12 - see videos like that make sure you
07:13 - subscribe to the channel and you hit the
07:15 - like button on this video and if you
07:17 - have any ideas on games that you want to
07:18 - see how to program and I see a popular
07:21 - vote if you guys see anything down in
07:22 - the comments below and you want to see a
07:24 - video not too make sure you like the
07:25 - comment because I obviously want to be
07:27 - making videos that you guys want to
07:28 - watch and that you guys want to learn
07:30 - how to do so if you have any ideas make
07:32 - sure you leave them down below and
07:34 - that's been it for this video so I'll
