00:00 - all right so the first thing to do
00:01 - that's going to save you a lot of time
00:02 - is to avoid bugs now I will say and I
00:05 - acknowledge this bugs are going to
00:07 - happen they're inevitable you're going
00:08 - to run into them so being able to kind
00:10 - of avoid as many as possible and then
00:12 - understanding how to solve them when you
00:13 - run into them is going to save you
00:14 - massive amounts of time to avoid bugs
00:18 - the first thing I recommend is just
00:19 - thinking before you start rambling and
00:21 - just writing a ton of code what I
00:23 - usually do is I'll bring up my
00:24 - whiteboard and I'll bring out my tablet
00:26 - and I'll start drawing stuff out and
00:27 - just thinking logically about the
00:29 - problem and I start thinking about
00:30 - possible edge cases for what I'm doing
00:32 - why this might break and I'm trying to
00:34 - break my own kind of concept and idea
00:36 - before I even bother implementing it
00:38 - into code
