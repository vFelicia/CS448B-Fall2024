00:02 - [Music]
00:06 - hello everybody and welcome back so in
00:09 - this video what I'm gonna be doing is
00:10 - building a brand new computer now I have
00:13 - a little bit of experience building
00:15 - computers the computer I have right now
00:16 - I built about three or four years ago I
00:18 - built a few computers for my friends so
00:20 - I kind of know what I'm doing but I've
00:22 - never worked with hardware at this scale
00:24 - and the last time I built a computer was
00:26 - like two years ago so this is gonna be
00:28 - an interesting video I have no idea how
00:30 - I'm gonna film any of this or what's
00:31 - even gonna happen so you're just gonna
00:32 - have to wait and see but let me tell you
00:34 - a little bit about the motivation behind
00:36 - this computer and why I've decided to go
00:38 - with some of the parts that I did so the
00:41 - reason I'm building this computer is
00:42 - because the one I have right now it's
00:44 - about three or four years old I kind of
00:45 - wanted a new one it's a little bit of a
00:47 - gift to myself before hitting three
00:49 - hundred thousand subscribers on YouTube
00:50 - I've just been working really hard I
00:52 - want to kind of get myself something and
00:54 - I think that this is a decent investment
00:56 - considering this hardware is gonna last
00:57 - me a very long time now what I do on my
01:00 - computer most of the day is really just
01:01 - programming work which this system right
01:03 - here is absolutely completely overkill
01:06 - for even some of the other things I'm
01:08 - gonna mention it is just way overkill
01:10 - but what else I do is some video editing
01:12 - I do some streaming content creation so
01:15 - it is worthy of me having a good
01:17 - computer I am gonna use this hardware
01:19 - but do I need something this fast no I
01:21 - just wanted it to be this fast so
01:23 - everyone that goes in the comments it's
01:25 - gonna tell me this is overkill I know I
01:27 - just want something fast I want
01:28 - something good and to be honest with you
01:30 - I don't mind spending the money because
01:31 - again this is just kind of a little
01:33 - treat to myself so with that being said
01:35 - let me go through some of the components
01:37 - here talk about why I picked them and
01:39 - then I'll try to go into some kind of
01:40 - video of me building this I don't know
01:43 - how that's gonna look and then I'll show
01:44 - you the final product alright so time to
01:46 - go through the parts here and I'll start
01:48 - by saying that this computer the entire
01:50 - build was about 4400 Canadian dollars
01:53 - now it might be a little bit off with
01:54 - that figure but it's in that range
01:56 - between like four and five thousand
01:57 - dollars and that is Canadian dollars so
02:00 - that's equivalent to u.s. dollars is
02:02 - about one point three five times more
02:04 - than a US dollar at the time of filming
02:06 - this video so you can use that as your
02:08 - conversion rate as we go through this
02:09 - video just note that again everything
02:11 - here's Canadian dollars because that's
02:14 - what I bought it for and that's the
02:15 - price that I know so with that being
02:17 - said done let's get started the first
02:19 - part I'm gonna talk about is the CPU so
02:22 - this is me Rison 930 900 X CPU it's 12
02:27 - cores
02:27 - it has 24 threads it has a 3.8 gigahertz
02:32 - base clock and a 4.6 gigahertz boost
02:35 - clock absolutely which is crazy CPU
02:39 - super overkill but again I wanted
02:41 - something that is just gonna rip
02:43 - everything to shreds just be super fast
02:44 - in any application and this will be
02:46 - really nice for editing and rendering
02:48 - and all of that kind of stuff next we
02:50 - move on to the GPU so this is the r-tx
02:54 - 2080 super just absolutely beast of a
02:58 - GPU sorry I forgot to mention this was
03:00 - 700 Canadian dollars this GPU is about
03:04 - 1100 Canadian dollars and it has
03:06 - ray-tracing and has all that fun stuff
03:08 - eight gigabytes of GDR six there's not
03:11 - really much more to talk about other
03:12 - than the fact that this is actually a
03:13 - white graphics card so I'll show it to
03:15 - you later but it's really cool what it
03:17 - looks like and it's RGB as well and
03:19 - that's gonna be fun to install in the
03:21 - system next we have the motherboard so
03:24 - obviously I needed something that was
03:25 - compatible with the rise in three I also
03:28 - wanted something I've had PCI 4 I wanted
03:30 - bluetooth I wanted Wi-Fi and I just
03:32 - wanted something that was a really good
03:33 - overall board so I was looking at a few
03:35 - boards with like 400 $500 they were all
03:38 - sold out I couldn't find anything in the
03:40 - mid-range so I either had to go low or
03:42 - high I decided to go high and I bought
03:44 - literally the best motherboard that
03:46 - consumers can pretty much buy today I'm
03:48 - sure that's alive but this is one of the
03:51 - best boards this was a $1000 motherboard
03:54 - yes I spent $1,000 almost the cost of my
03:56 - GPU on a motherboard it's hard to
04:00 - justify this but really it's just
04:01 - because I couldn't find anything else
04:02 - that was decent I was in stock and this
04:04 - is the Meg x5 70 god-like put it up here
04:08 - although it is kind of heavy and of
04:11 - course this has PCI for Wi-Fi Bluetooth
04:13 - it has a 10 Gigabit Ethernet card that
04:15 - actually comes with it it has 3 m dot 2
04:18 - slots comes with an expander card that
04:20 - has two more m2 slots which I'm not
04:23 - going to use as for 16 times
04:25 - see islands are PCI slots or whatever
04:28 - they are I don't know all the lingo and
04:29 - even opens up and has this cool little
04:31 - velcro thing you can actually see the
04:33 - board in it also has a display that can
04:36 - play like gifts on it and it has RGB and
04:38 - all of that really great motherboard
04:40 - this is gonna make it pretty much
04:42 - possible to upgrade to anything that I
04:44 - want so I won't have to buy another
04:46 - motherboard or anything like that in the
04:48 - future anyway super overkill didn't
04:49 - really want to buy this but kindness
04:51 - sorta was forced to so I just went ahead
04:53 - and did next I have 32 gigs of Corsair
04:57 - 32 hundred megahertz Ram nothing special
05:00 - about this it is RGB and white and
05:03 - that's just gonna be the RAM I wish I
05:05 - had bought something I've had more
05:06 - megahertz for this
05:08 - Rison CPU because they do like higher
05:10 - megahertz Ram but 32 mate hundred
05:12 - megahertz will do fine and 32 gigabytes
05:14 - will be more than enough Ram that I need
05:16 - next I have my oh s drive or my boot
05:19 - drive this is gonna be the Corsair MP
05:21 - 600 nvme gen 4 m2 SSD these things are
05:26 - stupid fast I didn't realize how fast
05:28 - they were rights at 5,000 megabytes a
05:31 - second or four thousand nine hundred
05:32 - fifty megabytes a second which is about
05:34 - 10 times faster than your standard SSD
05:37 - and I actually have two other 1 terabyte
05:39 - Samsung 860 Evo SSDs that I'm going to
05:43 - be putting in that I'm pulling from my
05:45 - system here that my system here is the
05:48 - one that's on the ground that I've been
05:49 - using currently next I have a 2 terabyte
05:52 - hard drive from Barracuda Seagate or
05:55 - something this is an older hard drive
05:57 - again I pulled it from my old system and
05:59 - then I have a really old hard drive that
06:01 - has a lot of videos on it that I just
06:03 - need to kind of install this is a 2
06:04 - terabyte random Toshiba hard drive
06:06 - couldn't tell you how old this is but I
06:09 - am gonna be using it because I don't
06:10 - want to buy another hard drive next I
06:12 - have these ll 120 white RGB fans I'm
06:16 - probably need to buy more of these
06:18 - because you'll see later that my case is
06:19 - massive but these will go well because
06:21 - they're the same fans that are on the
06:24 - next part that I wanted to talk about
06:26 - which is this so this is the H 100 I RGB
06:31 - water cooler I think this was like $250
06:34 - or something and yeah those are gonna
06:36 - cool the CPU that'll be a nice one and
06:38 - since
06:39 - forgot to talk about the prices these
06:41 - fans are like $170 this Ram was like
06:45 - $350 or something and this was like a
06:48 - hundred eighty bucks or something in
06:50 - that range next I have my power supply
06:54 - which is a Corsair RM a thousand X this
06:58 - is the most overkill power supply I
06:59 - could have bought that makes kind of
07:02 - sense I'm am thinking about potentially
07:04 - buying a second graphics card in the
07:06 - future so it is nice to have the
07:07 - possibility with this harddrive sorry
07:10 - with this power supply to power both of
07:12 - them I wanted an 850 watt power supply
07:14 - again they were pretty much out of stock
07:16 - so I just want one up and that is kind
07:19 - of how we ended up with this I have a
07:21 - few other random things that I'm gonna
07:22 - be still installing the in the PC that I
07:24 - already have I also have a huge case
07:26 - that's literally too big to fit on my
07:28 - desk so I'll show you that and last
07:30 - thing to mention is this is an e ATX
07:32 - motherboard which means it's a little
07:33 - bit wider than the standard motherboard
07:35 - so it does take up quite a bit of room
07:37 - and that is why I needs to go with the
07:39 - case that I have which you guys will see
07:41 - as I start building this so with that
07:43 - being said those are the parts I hope
07:45 - all my numbers add it up there I didn't
07:47 - mention a few things but that's alright
07:49 - and yeah let's get into the build and
07:50 - let's look at the finished product
07:55 - [Music]
08:27 - [Music]
10:37 - so I'm here it's the next day and I have
10:40 - to be honest with you guys that I'm so
10:41 - happy with how this build turned out it
10:43 - took me a long time I put a lot of hard
10:45 - work into making this I have my brother
10:47 - kind of come down and helped me a little
10:48 - bit as well and after about three and a
10:50 - half to four hours of building here we
10:52 - are now there's a few hiccups along the
10:54 - way the one massive mistake I made was I
10:57 - accidentally cut one RGB fan wire don't
11:01 - even ask me how that happened because I
11:02 - don't really know it just all of a
11:03 - sudden RGB stopped working and I went in
11:05 - the back and saw that I had cut the wire
11:07 - so that's interesting I had to throw one
11:10 - of those fans up at the top so that you
11:11 - can no longer see it and then I went out
11:13 - and bought some more ll1 20 fans just to
11:15 - make the thing really feel complete and
11:17 - fill up the entire front intake with 420
11:20 - millimeter fans so I think this looks
11:22 - really nice the white is really clean
11:24 - and I'm just so satisfied with it and
11:25 - it's really awesome to be able to build
11:27 - this because a few years ago this would
11:29 - have been what I would have considered
11:30 - kind of a dream PC of mine when I was 16
11:32 - 17 and today I'm actually able to make
11:34 - that a reality really because of the
11:36 - hard work I've put into this YouTube
11:37 - channel so with that being said I hope
11:39 - you guys enjoyed this PC build apologize
11:42 - if the clips are not up to standard with
11:43 - some of those massive channels that do
11:45 - this for a living but it's just a fun
11:47 - video I want it to put out and show to
11:48 - you guys so with that being said if you
11:50 - enjoyed make sure you leave a like
11:51 - subscribe and of course let me know what
11:53 - you think of my new PC build
