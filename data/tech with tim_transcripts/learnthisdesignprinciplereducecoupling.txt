00:00 - third design principle I have for you is
00:02 - known as reducing coupling now coupling
00:04 - occurs when you have packages modules
00:06 - classes files that are very
00:08 - interdependent on each other so what
00:10 - this means is that you have some package
00:12 - and it relies on this other package and
00:14 - if this other package has some major
00:16 - change to it that's going to affect the
00:18 - package that is depending on it and so
00:20 - having a system that is highly coupled
00:22 - although it may make it easier to
00:23 - implement is going to make it much
00:25 - harder to debug and much harder to fix
00:28 - if anything goes wrong in some of the
00:29 - coupled components if you can make your
00:31 - components in your system as independent
00:33 - as possible that's generally best makes
00:36 - it easier to debug and really it's just
00:38 - a better design in general you don't
00:40 - want to have things that are highly
00:42 - dependent on each other
