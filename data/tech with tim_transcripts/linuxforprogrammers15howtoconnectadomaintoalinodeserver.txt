00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:10 - linux for programmers tutorial video
00:13 - in this video i'm going to be showing
00:14 - you how to connect a domain
00:16 - to your lenode server now the reason you
00:18 - would want to do this is so that you
00:19 - don't actually have to navigate to your
00:21 - website by typing in the ip address of a
00:23 - machine
00:24 - instead you're going to type in a domain
00:26 - and that domain is going to be connected
00:28 - to the server
00:29 - such that it knows to kind of ask the
00:31 - server for the website
00:33 - and that's where the requests are going
00:34 - to be sent to so anyways i'm going to be
00:36 - showing you how to do that
00:37 - i'm also going to show you how to make
00:39 - it so your website will run
00:40 - once you close this ssh window so you
00:43 - may have noticed that when you ran that
00:44 - unicorn command previously in the last
00:47 - video
00:47 - as soon as you close this ssh window
00:49 - your website stopped working
00:51 - so to make this website continue to work
00:53 - there's kind of a little trick that we
00:54 - have to do which i will show you in one
00:56 - second
00:57 - anyways we'll get into that after a
00:58 - quick word from the sponsor of this
01:00 - video and this series which is lenode
01:02 - lenode makes it extremely easy for
01:04 - developers to start up
01:05 - linux machines with their one-click
01:07 - applications and
01:08 - great support the node has support for
01:10 - domains as you're going to see in this
01:12 - video
01:12 - support for kubernetes docker and a
01:15 - bunch of other technologies that you're
01:16 - going to be using a lot
01:17 - as a programmer so get started with
01:19 - lenod today by hitting the link in the
01:21 - description and claiming a hundred
01:22 - dollars in free credit when you sign up
01:24 - with a new account
01:26 - all right so let's get into it the first
01:27 - thing i'm going to show you is how you
01:28 - can run this website even when your ssh
01:31 - window is closed
01:32 - so by default when you type a command
01:34 - and you're ssh into a linux machine
01:37 - that command or that process whatever it
01:39 - is is attached
01:40 - to your ssh client to your ssh instance
01:43 - so as soon as you close the ssh window
01:45 - whatever was running is just going to
01:46 - stop
01:47 - running so to fix this you need to use a
01:49 - prefix before this command which is
01:51 - called
01:51 - screen now i won't get into a ton of
01:53 - detail here but what screen will do
01:55 - is detach the process from the ssh
01:58 - window
01:58 - such that when you close the ssh window
02:00 - it's still going to be running
02:01 - so all i have to do if i want to make
02:03 - this website live when this ssh window
02:05 - is closed
02:06 - is type and then the
02:21 - or should run my website you can see
02:23 - it's listening on
02:24 - localhost and now if i go here and i
02:27 - refresh
02:27 - all is good now watch when i close my
02:30 - ssh window so i'm going to close the
02:31 - session you can see this is my website i
02:33 - keep refreshing and it is still working
02:36 - if we had not have typed screen then as
02:37 - soon as i close the ssh window this
02:39 - website would stop
02:40 - working all right so now we need to
02:42 - connect a domain to our lenove so to do
02:45 - this we first need to purchase a domain
02:47 - now i actually have a domain this is
02:48 - called timeoutwithtim.net
02:50 - i had a podcast that i did a while ago
02:52 - that was called timeout with tim and
02:54 - while i purchased this domain
02:55 - and actually never had any use for it i
02:57 - never ended up using it so this is a
02:58 - good
02:59 - purpose for it i can use it in this
03:01 - video but yeah you do need a domain
03:03 - unfortunately i can't give you a domain
03:05 - for free so you will need to purchase
03:07 - one if you want to follow along
03:08 - although i'm kind of going to assume if
03:09 - you're watching this you probably
03:10 - already have a domain
03:12 - all right so assuming you have a domain
03:14 - purchase it on whatever website you want
03:16 - i'm using namecheap that's just what
03:17 - i've used for a bunch of my domains but
03:19 - you can use godaddy
03:20 - or any other domain provider that you
03:23 - want and you need to go into the
03:24 - settings of your domain
03:26 - so go into the settings and then what
03:27 - you're going to look for is name
03:29 - servers now it's hard for me to tell you
03:31 - where this is going to be because this
03:32 - will depend on the website that you're
03:34 - on
03:34 - but if you are in namecheap here then
03:37 - you should just be able to go to domain
03:38 - and then name servers and it's you know
03:40 - pretty obvious where it is
03:42 - so what we need to do here first is we
03:43 - need to change our dns to be custom dns
03:46 - so you might have like if you're on
03:47 - namecheap it might be basic dns
03:49 - might be web hosting dns whatever change
03:52 - it to custom dns
03:53 - the reason for this is we want to point
03:55 - this domain to our lenode server
03:58 - so lenode has these name servers that we
04:00 - need to add as
04:01 - name servers for our domain so that we
04:03 - can manage our domain
04:04 - from lenod so you'll see that in one
04:06 - second but the name servers that we need
04:08 - to add here
04:08 - are ns1 dot lenode.com
04:12 - ns2.
04:15 - and then all the way up to five so ns3
04:17 - dollar node.com
04:19 - and s4.lenode.com and then finally
04:25 - ns5.lenode.com
04:26 - so once we have these name servers i'm
04:28 - going to press this little check mark to
04:30 - save these
04:31 - and you're going to notice that we're
04:32 - going to get some notification that pops
04:34 - up here in a second
04:34 - that says this might take up to 48 hours
04:37 - to take effect
04:38 - now it almost never takes this long for
04:40 - your name servers to resolve or for your
04:43 - uh your domain name to resolve
04:45 - but sometimes it can take up to two days
04:47 - so just keep in mind that this is not
04:49 - going to be instant and if your domain
04:50 - is not working immediately
04:52 - just be patient it will work it's just
04:53 - going to take you know a few hours or
04:54 - potentially a few
04:56 - days so i won't be able to show you the
04:57 - finished product in this video because
04:59 - well we're gonna have to wait you know a
05:00 - day or two for this to resolve
05:02 - uh but you get the idea so once we've
05:04 - added these name servers what we're
05:06 - gonna do is head over here to lenode and
05:09 - we are now going to
05:10 - add our domain so the reason we added
05:12 - these name servers is so that now we can
05:14 - manage our domain
05:15 - from lenode so now we head over to
05:17 - lenode after we've added those five name
05:19 - servers to our domain
05:21 - we're going to press create a domain
05:23 - from the domains tab
05:24 - so press create a domain and then what
05:26 - you're going to do is you're going to
05:27 - type in the name of your domain
05:29 - so in this case mine was
05:33 - timeoutwithtim.net
05:34 - now it requires that you put an email in
05:36 - here so just put whatever
05:38 - email you want i will just put my
05:39 - business one so tim
05:41 - techwithtim.net all right so now i'm
05:43 - going to press
05:44 - create domain now notice that you can
05:46 - insert default records from one of your
05:48 - nodes so if you want to do this this is
05:50 - probably the easiest way you can press
05:52 - insert default records for one of myla
05:54 - nodes then you can select the node so
05:57 - i'm going to select
05:57 - flask app and then press create domain
06:00 - but if you know how to insert your own a
06:02 - records you don't have to do this
06:04 - if you have no idea what i'm talking
06:05 - about with a records then probably
06:06 - follow along with this step
06:08 - so we will continue in one second but i
06:09 - need to quickly thank the other sponsor
06:11 - of this video which is algo
06:13 - expert algo expert is the best platform
06:15 - to use from preparing for your software
06:16 - engineering coding interviews they have
06:18 - over 120 coding interview questions
06:20 - and each and every one of those
06:22 - questions have full video solutions
06:24 - detailed walkthroughs conceptual
06:26 - overviews and code
06:27 - walkthroughs get started with algo
06:29 - expert today by hitting the link in the
06:30 - description
06:31 - and using the code tech with tim for a
06:33 - discount on the platform
06:35 - alright so you can see that our domain
06:37 - is now set up and notice that we have
06:39 - all of these a records that were
06:40 - automatically added for us
06:42 - so what an a record is is just an
06:44 - address so that's all it stands for it
06:45 - stands for address
06:47 - so you have a host name which is like
06:48 - your domain for example
06:50 - and then that is going to point to a
06:52 - specific address
06:53 - so in this case we're pointing to the
06:54 - address of our lenode server
06:56 - so we're saying timeout with tim needs
06:58 - to point to and then whatever this ip
07:00 - address is
07:01 - that's going to be the ip you can see
07:03 - right here of our website previously or
07:05 - of the server that we are running the
07:07 - website on
07:08 - now it's important that you have an a
07:09 - record for both the ipv4 address
07:11 - and the ipv6 address and really the only
07:14 - two you're going to need are these two
07:16 - right here that were automatically added
07:18 - for us
07:19 - now you also of course can add www and
07:22 - mail
07:22 - i'm not going to talk about these ones
07:23 - because we don't really need them
07:25 - but if i go to add an a record here this
07:27 - is how you can add your own custom a
07:29 - records
07:30 - so let's say you want to add something
07:31 - like a sub domain if you wanted to add a
07:34 - sub domain then
07:35 - what you would have to do is go into the
07:36 - a records here and you would have to
07:38 - type the name of your subdomain so say
07:39 - like api
07:40 - or something then the ip address that
07:42 - you wanted to point it to so that would
07:44 - mean if you went to
07:46 - api.timeoutwithtim.net
07:47 - that would point to and then whatever
07:49 - the ip address is that you put in here
07:51 - now you also can point subdomains to
07:53 - different servers you can point this
07:54 - domain to different servers
07:56 - there's a lot of things you can do here
07:57 - i'm not an expert on a records and doing
07:59 - all this kind of stuff so i'm going to
08:01 - admit talking about it too much
08:03 - but this is the basic idea behind adding
08:05 - a domain so this is actually
08:06 - as simple as it is you just have to
08:08 - point the domain to lenode so you have
08:10 - to add all of the name servers in here
08:12 - you have to wait for this to resolve and
08:14 - then you have to add the domain on the
08:16 - node and then you can manage it from
08:17 - here
08:18 - so you can see we have our primary
08:19 - domain we have our ns record so our name
08:22 - servers we have our mail records and our
08:24 - a records
08:25 - so that's all i have for you i apologize
08:27 - that there wasn't a ton of content in
08:28 - this video
08:29 - but that's all i need to show you to add
08:31 - a domain so if you want to add a domain
08:32 - to a node you point
08:34 - the domain to lenode by adding the name
08:36 - servers you then come in here
08:37 - create a new domain and then you manage
08:39 - the domain by changing its a records
08:41 - in any of the other settings that you
08:43 - want now again you can just use that
08:45 - really simple shortcut that i showed you
08:46 - so you press you know
08:47 - set up the a records automatically and
08:49 - then it will just add all these in for
08:51 - you you just wait a few hours then you
08:53 - should be good to go
08:54 - so anyways i hope you guys enjoyed if
08:55 - you did make sure to leave a like
08:56 - subscribe to the channel and i will see
08:58 - you in another
