00:00 - if you want to be a competent developer
00:02 - you need to work on projects but not
00:04 - just any projects ones that actually
00:06 - give you the skills that make you stand
00:07 - out as a developer that's why in this
00:10 - video I'll share with you three types of
00:12 - projects that are guaranteed to make you
00:14 - a
00:16 - [Music]
00:18 - programmer now the first type of project
00:20 - that you need to build is something that
00:22 - you have no idea how to build that's
00:24 - right you need to pick an idea up that
00:26 - seems so incredibly difficult so far out
00:29 - there so forign something that you
00:30 - genuinely don't even know how to begin
00:32 - I'm talking about projects where you
00:34 - might not even know the programming
00:35 - language you're going to use you don't
00:37 - know the framework you don't know the
00:38 - IDE you'll be using what operating
00:40 - system it's going to run on something
00:41 - that is so foreign and so out there
00:43 - where you genuinely have to start right
00:45 - from the beginning pretty much as a
00:47 - beginner now the nice thing is you still
00:49 - have your programming knowledge and a
00:51 - lot of what you know is going to carry
00:52 - over into that project however when you
00:55 - start a project you have no idea how to
00:57 - build you have to learn a ton and you
00:59 - have to figure figure out how to learn
01:00 - as efficiently as possible so right when
01:02 - you learn something you can apply it
01:04 - into the project I find the times I
01:07 - learn the fastest and the best or where
01:09 - I have something I need to build and I
01:11 - don't know how to do it that forces me
01:13 - to be resourceful go out there learn a
01:15 - new skill and pick up only the
01:17 - information I actually need to
01:19 - immediately apply it in the project this
01:21 - is a massive skill and that's why I want
01:22 - you to build this type of project now
01:24 - what this will also do is help you build
01:26 - your confidence being able to finish a
01:28 - project that you genuin had no idea how
01:31 - to build when you started is going to
01:32 - allow you to realize hey I'm a
01:34 - programmer I'm not just a python
01:36 - developer or a JavaScript developer I'm
01:38 - a programmer I'm someone who can write
01:40 - code in any language any framework and I
01:42 - can figure it out it might take me a
01:44 - little bit longer but now that I've done
01:45 - it with this project I feel confident to
01:47 - do it with any type of project those are
01:49 - the best programmers ones that are
01:51 - experienced in multiple languages
01:53 - multiple Frameworks and have the
01:54 - confidence to know that their skill set
01:56 - can be applied in pretty much any domain
01:58 - any role any application doesn't matter
02:01 - what it is now that's exactly why in my
02:03 - software development course which you
02:05 - can check out from the link in the
02:06 - description we teach you multiple
02:08 - programming languages and actually get
02:09 - you to specialize in a specific area of
02:12 - development so you realize that you can
02:13 - be good at JavaScript go and then you
02:16 - can go and learn devops then you can
02:17 - learn backend then you can learn front
02:19 - end you're flexible Dynamic and you're
02:21 - someone who really stands out as a
02:23 - junior developer if you guys are
02:24 - interested in that course check it out
02:26 - from the link in the description we have
02:27 - an entire network of employers that are
02:29 - ready to interview the top students
02:31 - graduating from the program we've
02:33 - already had a few people that have
02:34 - finished the final exams and are just
02:36 - getting to that phase right now anyways
02:38 - I'll give you an example of an app that
02:40 - I built when I was younger that did
02:41 - pretty much exactly what I described now
02:43 - when I was in grade 11 I had only ever
02:45 - written code in Python I was actually
02:47 - pretty good at development already but I
02:49 - had really no experience outside of
02:51 - python and a little bit of c and some
02:53 - basic web development now I had a
02:55 - problem I always had to walk every day
02:57 - from school to home it was about a 30-
02:59 - minute walk and I constantly had to
03:00 - carry these super heavy textbooks that
03:02 - were like 20 30 pounds in my backpack
03:04 - and it really kind of took a toll on me
03:06 - so what I would do instead is take
03:08 - photos of the textbook pages I needed
03:10 - and just look at them at home the issue
03:11 - was by the time I did this the 50th 60th
03:14 - day I had hundreds of photos in my
03:15 - camera roll and it was pretty difficult
03:17 - to actually locate the pages that I
03:19 - needed so what I wanted to do was make
03:21 - an iPhone app that I could have on my
03:22 - phone that could just organize all of
03:24 - these photos for me and kind of keep a
03:25 - log of all of my textbook pages homework
03:28 - assignments questions I needed to do Etc
03:31 - now I had no idea how to build this so I
03:33 - actually had to start building an IOS
03:35 - app and I didn't even know what IDE to
03:37 - use what framework I needed what
03:38 - language I was going to write in so I
03:40 - ended up learning Swift learning xcode
03:43 - building a UI learning all of the
03:45 - intricacies of iOS development and in
03:47 - about a month I was able to make this
03:48 - app now this was really the first time
03:50 - in my life that I gained that confidence
03:52 - to feel like hey I just went from having
03:55 - no experience how to do this to building
03:56 - a full-fledged IOS app in about a month
03:59 - what does that mean I can do in the
04:00 - future that means I can learn any
04:02 - language that means I can learn any
04:03 - framework and it really made me feel
04:05 - like much more of a programmer and not
04:07 - just a python developer so I encourage
04:10 - you to build similar things like that
04:12 - especially if they help you in your real
04:13 - world life those are some of the best
04:15 - projects where again you constantly have
04:17 - to find exactly the information you need
04:19 - apply that immediately and continue that
04:22 - process until you finish the
04:24 - [Music]
04:26 - project now the second project you need
04:29 - to build if you want to be a programmer
04:31 - is something that has real users now
04:33 - this doesn't need to be millions of
04:35 - users or hundreds of thousands of users
04:37 - or even tens of users it could be two
04:39 - users it could be three users it could
04:40 - be your mom it could be your brother it
04:42 - could be you who's using the application
04:44 - but it's so important to actually build
04:46 - something that's used by real people
04:48 - that's because people interact with an
04:50 - application a lot different than you
04:52 - think and often times it's very
04:54 - difficult to actually imagine how
04:56 - someone's going to use the code that
04:57 - you've written and it makes you think
04:59 - about about things in a very different
05:00 - perspective when you have real people
05:02 - using your application giving you
05:04 - feedback you need to think about things
05:06 - in a very different way first of all is
05:08 - what I'm building actually helping the
05:10 - user is it just cool for me or is it
05:12 - something that's actually going to be
05:13 - useful and worth their time second of
05:16 - all how easy is it for the user to use
05:18 - this feature can they understand it is
05:20 - it intuitive do they need instructions
05:22 - it just gives you a very different
05:24 - mindset on things and it forces you to
05:26 - be almost a product manager while an
05:28 - engineer at the same time which I think
05:30 - is a really valuable skill at the same
05:32 - time you need ways to track your users
05:35 - analytics you need to figure out if bugs
05:36 - are occurring or errors are occurring
05:38 - you need way to capture feedback and you
05:40 - need to design with the user in mind so
05:42 - I would encourage you pick some type of
05:45 - application that real people are
05:46 - actually going to use I'll give you an
05:48 - example of one that I made my friends
05:50 - and I would constantly complain about
05:52 - who was on aux Ox meaning controlling
05:54 - the music and all of my friends pretty
05:56 - much use Spotify so I actually coded a
05:59 - solution that was going to be used by
06:00 - about five or 10 of us where what we
06:02 - could do is go onto some kind of app we
06:04 - could see the current Spotify song that
06:05 - was playing and then we could vote to
06:07 - skip that song Or vote to add a new song
06:09 - to the queue I essentially tried to
06:11 - design a collaborative kind of music
06:13 - playing system so that we no longer had
06:15 - to have these arguments about who is
06:17 - going to be controlling the music at a
06:18 - party event when we were playing cards
06:20 - whatever now I actually put this project
06:22 - on YouTube you guys can go and check it
06:24 - out if you want to see that anyways this
06:25 - was a real world app where I learned a
06:27 - ton and I had to constantly commun
06:29 - unicate with the users of the app and
06:31 - see if they were actually getting the
06:33 - value I intended them to get there was a
06:35 - lot of changes I needed to make a lot of
06:36 - things I needed to add and it really
06:38 - made me think about development in a
06:40 - different way that's why I encourage you
06:42 - to build an app that has real
06:44 - [Music]
06:47 - users now the last type of project you
06:49 - need to build to really become a great
06:51 - developer is something with a team or a
06:54 - partner you need to go outside of your
06:56 - Solo preneur or solo developer mindset
06:59 - and realize how you can actually develop
07:01 - with someone else or with a team of
07:03 - people now this will change a lot of
07:04 - things especially if you've never done
07:06 - this before because immediately your
07:07 - code quality now is going to be put into
07:09 - question other people are going to be
07:11 - reading and working with your code
07:13 - people are going to be looking at your
07:14 - poll requests your commit messages and
07:16 - it makes you think about things in a
07:18 - very different way all of a sudden it's
07:20 - not just for you it's for other people
07:22 - as well and you need to learn how to
07:23 - collaborate how to delegate how to make
07:25 - sure multiple people aren't working on
07:27 - the same tasks how to deal with conflict
07:29 - how to use git properly or Version
07:31 - Control software and that's exactly why
07:33 - in my course we encourage you to
07:35 - collaborate with people through our
07:36 - Discord server and our community and we
07:38 - have all kinds of lessons and resources
07:40 - related to git and also just software
07:42 - engineering tools and kind of best
07:44 - practices that you don't stand out as a
07:46 - complete beginner when it comes to
07:48 - collaborative work anyways I encourage
07:50 - you find someone that you can work with
07:52 - now you can do this with a friend if you
07:54 - know other people that are into
07:55 - development you could do this with
07:56 - someone from like a Discord group so
07:58 - whether that be my or my free Discord
08:00 - server you guys could check that out
08:02 - people are always looking for other
08:03 - people to work on projects with and even
08:05 - if you join an open source project
08:07 - that's good too the point is you need to
08:10 - get experience working with other
08:11 - developers see how that works the
08:13 - communication channels and you'll
08:15 - realize that a lot of what you're doing
08:16 - on a day-to-day basis isn't just
08:18 - development it's actually collaboration
08:20 - and it really changes the way in which
08:22 - you do things so to summarize you need
08:24 - to work on a project that you have no
08:26 - idea how to build one that has real
08:28 - users and one that involves
08:29 - collaboration with real people whether
08:31 - that be a team or a partner if you do
08:33 - all of that I guarantee you you will
08:35 - massively improve as a programmer and
08:37 - you will see a huge confidence boost in
08:39 - yourself and the quality of work you can
08:41 - deliver if you guys enjoyed this video
