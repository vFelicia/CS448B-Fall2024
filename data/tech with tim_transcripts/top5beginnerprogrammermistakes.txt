00:02 - [Music]
00:06 - so it's no secret that learning to code
00:08 - is something that's quite difficult a
00:10 - lot of people have trouble with it they
00:11 - give up they can't get far enough into
00:13 - it to find it interesting and it's just
00:15 - something that a lot of people are
00:16 - trying to get into nowadays but can't
00:18 - get past those beginner levels now what
00:20 - I'm gonna do in this video is talk to
00:22 - you about the top 5 beginner programming
00:24 - mistakes I see and how you can stop
00:26 - making those mistakes and continue
00:28 - learning to code and keep that
00:30 - motivation I know it's really hard when
00:32 - you're getting stuck you can't move past
00:33 - something you don't know what to learn
00:35 - next and you run into the mistakes that
00:36 - I'm gonna talk about here so if you can
00:38 - avoid those you're gonna become a better
00:40 - developer just by learning more about
00:42 - coding and hopefully get past some of
00:43 - these obstacles that maybe are holding
00:45 - you back so with that being said let's
00:47 - go ahead and get into the top 5 beginner
00:49 - programming mistakes after a quick word
00:51 - from our sponsor

01:39 - full stack applications start your
01:41 - journey becoming a master of Java
01:42 - technologies in the web development
01:44 - today by hitting the link in the
01:45 - description all right so let me start by
01:47 - give me a little bit of background in
01:48 - some context into myself so you
01:50 - understand where I'm getting some of
01:51 - this information from so my name is Tim
01:53 - I'm 19 most of you know that I'm
01:55 - actually a full-time student and I've
01:57 - been teaching coding since I was 15
01:59 - years old so I started programming
02:01 - myself when I was 12 but when I was 15 I
02:03 - was working on a summer camp summer camp
02:05 - as a stem program coordinator I worked
02:07 - there for three years and I was in
02:09 - charge of running a coding specialty
02:11 - that focused on teaching fundamental
02:13 - Python Pro
02:13 - gramming two kids aged 10 to 15 years
02:15 - old I've also been teaching coding on
02:17 - this YouTube channel for the past two or
02:19 - three years I've taught hundreds of
02:21 - thousands of people basic Python
02:22 - programming as well as advanced concepts
02:24 - and let's just say you know I talk to a
02:26 - lot of beginner Python programmers I've
02:28 - done private tutoring I just I have a
02:30 - wealth of kind of knowledge and
02:32 - expertise especially in teaching
02:33 - beginner concepts in programming so with
02:36 - that being said let's get into mistake
02:37 - number one the first and probably the
02:40 - most important mistake I see people
02:41 - making all the time is memorizing and
02:44 - not understanding now what I mean by
02:47 - that is when you learn something new the
02:49 - tendency for a lot of courses a lot of
02:52 - people they're in traditional education
02:53 - programs is just to memorize something
02:55 - just to think of how they can replicate
02:57 - it on a test replicate it in some
02:59 - environment and not truly understand
03:01 - exactly why something works now when
03:04 - programming as you'll notice as you get
03:06 - more advanced into it it really is so
03:09 - just conceptually important to
03:11 - understand exactly what you're doing and
03:13 - why it works what you're doing rather
03:16 - than just memorizing snippets of code
03:18 - and pasting things in I see this so
03:20 - commonly with beginners that they'll
03:22 - take for example X a piece of code that
03:24 - I wrote right and they'll just paste it
03:26 - in some random part in their program and
03:28 - they know what it does they know the
03:30 - input and the output but they don't
03:32 - understand or have any idea why now why
03:35 - this becomes an issue is because when
03:37 - something goes wrong or this code does
03:39 - not perform the way you expected you
03:41 - have absolutely no idea how to fix it
03:43 - why it works or even what the heck is
03:45 - going on so you need to as a beginner
03:48 - really be focusing on especially as a
03:50 - beginner why something works and
03:53 - understanding every single component to
03:55 - some piece of code or to some tutorial
03:57 - or whatever it is that you're learning
03:59 - before you go ahead and use that or move
04:01 - on now it is okay sometimes to use a
04:03 - little piece of code if you don't fully
04:05 - understand why it's working but for
04:07 - fundamental things like understanding a
04:09 - for loop understanding if statements
04:11 - prints strings things like that that are
04:13 - fundamental to a programming language
04:15 - you need to understand why they work
04:18 - exactly and not memorize it whatsoever
04:20 - programming has absolutely zero
04:23 - memorization to it what ends up
04:25 - happening is you will just
04:27 - memorizing those topics because you
04:29 - understand them so well and you've used
04:31 - them enough times so a lot a very common
04:34 - mistake is people try to memorize syntax
04:36 - they try to memorize specific algorithms
04:38 - or pieces of code you don't want to
04:40 - memorize something you want to
04:41 - understand why it works because if you
04:43 - have that you have the understanding you
04:45 - can very easily replicate that in
04:47 - whatever way that may be right so really
04:50 - focus on understanding something and not
04:52 - memorizing something that's the mistake
04:54 - I see so commonly people copying pasting
04:56 - things and that really just hinders your
04:58 - learning and doesn't let you go anywhere
05:00 - so mistake number two is closely related
05:02 - to mistake number one and this is do not
05:04 - skip the fundamentals or I guess the
05:07 - mistake version of that would be
05:08 - skipping the fundamentals so the common
05:11 - mistake that I see is people decide to
05:13 - jump into the deep end before they learn
05:15 - how to swim that's the analogy I like to
05:17 - give you for example jumping into
05:19 - machine learning after learning coding
05:21 - for two weeks that is an example of
05:23 - skipping the fundamentals in my opinion
05:26 - it should take you a month to maybe
05:28 - three months to really nail if you're a
05:30 - brand new programmer the fundamentals of
05:33 - programming and what I mean by that is
05:35 - understanding how to solve very basic
05:37 - problems understanding for loops if you
05:40 - know conditions the basic fundamental
05:42 - concepts that apply in almost every
05:44 - programming language you need to know
05:46 - before you start getting into these more
05:49 - complex specific domains now that's my
05:52 - opinion but this is a huge mistake I see
05:54 - and what discourages a lot of people
05:56 - from getting into program they do like a
05:58 - weak course on code Academy of Python
06:00 - they don't really understand half of the
06:02 - stuff that's been taught there they've
06:04 - just copied and pasted code and they're
06:05 - like well I learned the Python
06:07 - programming language let's go ahead and
06:09 - try to build you know the next Google a
06:11 - I like or deepmind or whatever it's
06:13 - called no no no please do not do that if
06:16 - you really want to get good at
06:17 - programming if you really want to excel
06:19 - and this is gonna speed up your process
06:21 - I guarantee you make sure you nail the
06:24 - fundamentals like you do so much
06:26 - fundamental programming solving really
06:28 - basic problems working on a few mini
06:30 - projects on the side making sure you
06:33 - understand all these concepts that are
06:35 - built into the standard language you're
06:36 - learning before you go ahead and start
06:39 - working with frameworks and
06:40 - and more advanced things that assume you
06:43 - have this understanding it literally is
06:45 - like what I described at the beginning
06:46 - you cannot jump into the deep end of the
06:48 - pool if you don't know how to swim if
06:50 - you do you're just gonna freak out and
06:51 - try to get out as fast as possible and
06:53 - that's what happens with a lot of
06:55 - beginners you know they want to get into
06:57 - programming because they hear the
06:58 - salaries or they hear you know what cool
07:00 - stuff you can do with AI or they want to
07:02 - make 3d games and make a bunch of money
07:04 - but they don't want to put in the work
07:06 - to learn the fundamentals and by the
07:08 - time they get to the stuff that's
07:09 - interesting they can't do it because
07:11 - they don't have that fundamental
07:13 - knowledge so you know go ahead and
07:14 - suffer through which I don't really
07:15 - consider suffering maysun some may
07:18 - suffer through those beginning maybe
07:19 - more boring things because if you really
07:21 - truly understand what they are you will
07:24 - be able to learn any other programming
07:26 - you know concept topic whatever it is
07:28 - that you want because you'll have that
07:30 - really strong foundation already built
07:32 - so this next mistake is a big one and it
07:35 - is not having fun now it's unfortunate
07:37 - but I see so often with beginner
07:39 - programmers especially those that are my
07:41 - age that are students they just get
07:43 - stuck in this hole where what they do is
07:45 - they just like slave away every day
07:48 - learning new programming topics you know
07:50 - like every day they just want to be as
07:51 - efficient as possible and just learn
07:53 - something new and make sure they're
07:54 - learning and doing the most practical
07:56 - things possible and you know they're not
07:57 - wasting time making stupid games they're
07:59 - working on things they're gonna put on
08:00 - that resume and that they want to show
08:02 - or put on the App Store and you know
08:04 - that's great I'm not judging those kind
08:06 - of people but I can tell you that this
08:08 - gets old fast and you want to make sure
08:10 - that when you're starting programming at
08:12 - least you're working on things that to
08:14 - you are enjoyable like say there's some
08:16 - stupid game that you know no one likes
08:18 - but you really enjoyed and you want to
08:19 - try to recreate it or make some small
08:21 - version of it or something like that do
08:23 - that it doesn't matter if it's not
08:24 - practical it doesn't matter if someone
08:26 - else is gonna you know look at your code
08:28 - and be like what is that do stuff that
08:30 - you enjoy programming is fun and to
08:32 - really get good at programming I
08:34 - honestly believe you need to enjoy what
08:36 - you're doing I don't know how you can
08:38 - sit for like two or three days in a row
08:41 - and just grind do the same thing and
08:43 - learn new concepts unless you really
08:45 - thoroughly enjoy doing that you should
08:47 - at least take some time each day to do
08:49 - some programming that you enjoy right if
08:51 - you're gonna be learning program
08:52 - every day I don't know what your
08:53 - schedule is but the idea here is just
08:55 - make sure you enjoy what you're doing
08:57 - because you don't want your passion to
08:58 - fade away from programming such an
09:01 - amazing field because you're just
09:02 - slaving away and trying to do the most
09:04 - practical things possible and this
09:06 - applies to I feel every aspect of life
09:08 - you know you don't want to suck yourself
09:10 - into a career where you're just there
09:12 - because you just want to get the job and
09:14 - you want to get the paycheck at the end
09:15 - of the day you want to be doing
09:16 - something that you thoroughly enjoy so
09:18 - make sure that when you're learning to
09:20 - code especially you know you're taking
09:22 - that time you're taking a few days maybe
09:23 - a weekend to work on things that you
09:25 - enjoy to keep your passion for this
09:28 - amazing field programming alive right
09:30 - that's how I've been able to program for
09:32 - so long since I was 12 years old and it
09:34 - hasn't got tiring yet because I take the
09:36 - time to do things that aren't that
09:37 - practical but that I find really cool
09:39 - and that I enjoy and I work on those
09:41 - projects that you know some people may
09:43 - consider a waste of time because they're
09:45 - not going on my resume but for me that's
09:47 - just another way to practice coding in
09:49 - an environment doing something that I
09:51 - enjoy so keep that in mind you want to
09:53 - have fun the best way to become a better
09:55 - programmer is to work on all kinds of
09:57 - projects that you enjoy and just you
09:59 - know keep that passion alive for
10:01 - something that I'm sure most people
10:02 - enjoy when they start and then as they
10:04 - get into it more and more you know that
10:06 - passion fades when they're just grinding
10:08 - and slaving away and not doing the
10:09 - enjoyable fun programming things that
10:11 - they want to do so the next mistake
10:13 - you're gonna want to avoid is getting
10:15 - stuck in what I call tutorial hell now
10:18 - what I mean by this is you're someone
10:20 - who every day when they wake up you know
10:22 - they really want to learn coding they're
10:23 - getting into it they're beginner but all
10:25 - they do is watch tutorial coding YouTube
10:27 - videos or watch tutorial videos or go
10:29 - through a course they don't ever do
10:31 - anything on their own now I understand
10:34 - it's overwhelming you know to jump into
10:36 - your own big projects and start working
10:38 - on it when you're a beginner but what
10:39 - you really need to be doing is at least
10:41 - applying the skills that you're learning
10:42 - from these tutorial videos on your own
10:44 - you cannot just have everyday someone
10:48 - holding your hand and walking you
10:49 - through different code concepts because
10:51 - even for me I can watch really advanced
10:53 - math lectures or really advanced topics
10:56 - and yeah that makes a lot of sense like
10:57 - that's cool
10:58 - I totally get what he's doing but then
11:00 - as soon as I get given the same problem
11:02 - and I don't have that video as a
11:03 - reference I'm lost I have no idea what
11:05 - to do
11:06 - is all I've actually done is understood
11:08 - what someone else has done I haven't
11:10 - applied that in my own way right like
11:13 - you can't go to a math exam after just
11:15 - watching all the lectures unless you
11:16 - know you're some next-level genius which
11:18 - I'm sure some of you guys are out there
11:20 - without having ever actually done a
11:22 - practice math question right and that's
11:24 - the idea here is that tutorial videos
11:26 - are great great don't get me wrong I
11:27 - make a ton them I literally make a
11:29 - living from supplying tutorial videos
11:31 - online but you want to make sure that
11:33 - after you've launched a few after you
11:34 - have a general understanding you try to
11:37 - apply that on your own because that's
11:39 - when you're gonna realize the gaps in
11:40 - your knowledge and you're gonna be able
11:42 - to learn a lot more you know use
11:44 - self-regulating yourself and saying hey
11:45 - you know I actually don't understand how
11:47 - to do this maybe I should go back and
11:49 - watch it again or maybe I should slowly
11:51 - reference some of these documentation
11:52 - pages and try to really nail this topic
11:55 - down by myself that's gonna help you a
11:57 - ton and as a beginner you need to make
11:59 - sure you're doing that you cannot be
12:01 - stuck in tutorial Hell where you've done
12:03 - six months of learning coding but all
12:04 - that has been is really just watching
12:06 - other people code on a screen it's a lot
12:08 - different when you're on your own and
12:10 - there's not someone holding your hand so
12:12 - this last mistake is probably the
12:13 - biggest reason I see people get
12:15 - discouraged easily or quick coding and
12:17 - that is comparing yourselves to others
12:20 - it is almost never fair to compare
12:23 - yourself in your current skill level to
12:25 - someone else because everyone has a
12:27 - different story everyone has a different
12:29 - journey everyone is different
12:30 - IQ levels and Nate abilities you cannot
12:33 - as a programmer especially a beginner
12:35 - look at someone that's Jewish like look
12:37 - at me who's 19 for example you cannot
12:39 - compare yourself to other people and say
12:42 - well he knows it I can't figure it out I
12:44 - guess I'm just not good at coding I'm
12:46 - gonna stop and that's what I see so
12:48 - often especially on my videos a lot of
12:50 - people will comment and say man you make
12:52 - me feel like crap because you're 19 and
12:54 - you're better than me and I'm 22 I'm
12:56 - like dude you cannot compare yourself to
12:59 - me I am a very completely different
13:02 - person than you are you know not many
13:03 - people learn coding for fun when they're
13:06 - 12 years old so please do yourself a
13:08 - favor and do not compare yourself to
13:10 - other programmers to other people
13:12 - everyone is different this applies to
13:14 - almost everything and the last thing you
13:16 - want to be doing
13:17 - is getting discouraged because you know
13:19 - you were classmate who picked up coding
13:21 - two months later than you is now better
13:22 - than you maybe he did more work maybe
13:24 - he's just naturally smarter right
13:26 - there's just you cannot do that everyone
13:29 - has their different abilities their
13:30 - different skill level and you cannot let
13:32 - yourself get discouraged by comparing
13:34 - yourself to others chances are you're
13:36 - better at something than someone else
13:37 - chances are someone looks up to you for
13:39 - some specific reason because you are
13:41 - better at a specific topic
13:43 - everyone has their skills their
13:44 - strengths and their weaknesses and the
13:46 - best thing you can do for yourself is be
13:48 - self-aware and understand what level
13:51 - you're at and what you need to do to get
13:53 - better so please do not watch other
13:55 - people programs don't look at peers
13:57 - friends other people and compare
13:59 - yourself to them that is the easiest way
14:01 - to just get discouraged get sad get
14:03 - upset and think your progress is not as
14:06 - good as it should be trust me the best
14:07 - thing to do is be self-aware understand
14:10 - what you need to work on and focus
14:12 - solely on yourself not comparing
14:14 - yourself to other people now obviously
14:16 - there's some exceptions here don't get
14:18 - me wrong but a general rule of thumb
14:19 - especially for you guys that are
14:21 - beginners they probably aren't jumping
14:23 - into the job market just yet that's the
14:25 - last thing you want to do is be
14:26 - comparing yourself to others especially
14:28 - those that are better than you because
14:29 - that's just an instant source of
14:31 - demotivation and that's the last thing
14:33 - you need when you're starting again to
14:34 - programming and really starting to get
14:36 - good and into the intermediate levels so
14:38 - with that being said that has been the
14:40 - five biggest programming mistakes I see
14:42 - from beginners do you guys agree with
14:44 - these mistakes is there any other
14:45 - mistakes you see from beginner
14:47 - programmers maybe yourself if you have
14:49 - any questions any comments please do
14:50 - leave them down below and with that
14:52 - being said that has been this video so
14:54 - if you guys enjoyed make sure you leave
14:55 - a like subscribe to the channel and I
14:57 - will see you guys in another YouTube
14:59 - video
