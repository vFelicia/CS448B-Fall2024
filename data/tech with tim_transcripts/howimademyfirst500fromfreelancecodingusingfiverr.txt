00:00 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:01 - youtube video
00:03 - so in today's video i'm going to be
00:04 - talking to you about how i made my first
00:06 - 500 freelance coding on a website
00:10 - called fiverr now i'm making this video
00:12 - because a few months ago i made a video
00:14 - called how to make money from coding
00:16 - in that video i discussed five ways that
00:18 - you can make money from coding without
00:20 - being an expert
00:21 - without having industry experience and
00:24 - without having to work a full-time job
00:26 - now one of those methods that i talked
00:28 - about was freelancing and a lot of you
00:30 - guys had questions
00:31 - you were saying things like oh i'm not
00:32 - good enough to freelance oh there's too
00:34 - many people freelancing
00:35 - oh i don't have enough skills that are
00:36 - marketable whatever it may be you came
00:38 - up with millions of excuses
00:40 - now i'm here to show you today that it
00:42 - doesn't matter what you are good at
00:44 - if you are good at any specific coding
00:46 - technology or tool or package or module
00:49 - whatever it is you can market that skill
00:51 - and you can get people to pay you
00:52 - to do it i'm going to show you exactly
00:54 - how as i go through how i made my first
00:57 - 500 on this website so first of all
01:00 - fiverr for any of you that don't know
01:01 - is simply a freelancing website you can
01:03 - go on there you can pay people to do
01:05 - stuff for you
01:05 - and of course you can kind of market
01:07 - yourself create little ads they're
01:09 - called
01:10 - gigs and say i will do this for you and
01:12 - then people can
01:13 - pay you to do that now here i filled out
01:15 - eight orders
01:16 - on this website so i completed eight
01:18 - orders you can see you can add up all
01:20 - the totals here
01:21 - uh they add up to something around like
01:22 - 600 us dollars and i think after
01:25 - fiverr took its cut i ended up making
01:27 - something like 500 us dollars or a
01:29 - little bit over that
01:30 - but anyways i'm going to show you
01:31 - exactly what i did for these orders
01:33 - how i got these orders and how you can
01:36 - do the same thing
01:37 - so let's dive in i'll start by showing
01:38 - you the advertisement i set up on this
01:40 - website
01:41 - and talk about why i kind of formulated
01:43 - it the way that i did
01:47 - [Music]
01:52 - all right so i've got my gig here that's
01:54 - what they're called on fiverr when you
01:56 - set up these little ads or little
01:58 - descriptions of what you'll do for
01:59 - people
02:00 - and pretty much you write i will and
02:01 - then whatever it is you're gonna do so i
02:03 - said i will create a game in python
02:06 - with pygame so immediately i'm not
02:08 - making a full stack website i'm not
02:10 - doing anything super complicated
02:12 - all i was doing for this specific
02:14 - freelancing job
02:15 - was making really crappy 2d games in
02:18 - python
02:19 - using the module pygame now the reason i
02:21 - decided to do this
02:23 - was because when i was 18 i was in my
02:24 - first year of computer science
02:26 - the only thing that i was really good at
02:28 - doing was working with this module
02:29 - called pygame
02:30 - i pretty much only knew python i knew a
02:32 - few other programming languages but not
02:34 - well enough to sell my skills in them
02:36 - and i was good with this module called
02:37 - pygame which lets you make
02:39 - little crappy 2d games now the reason i
02:42 - did this was because in high school i
02:43 - was actually forced to use this module
02:45 - for a class
02:46 - so i learned how to do this and then i
02:48 - kind of fell in love with just making
02:49 - these little crappy 2d games
02:51 - well i thought there might be some
02:52 - marker for this let me put it up and let
02:54 - me see if i can make you know a few
02:55 - bucks a week
02:56 - coding out these little games i might
02:58 - already have the game done i could
02:59 - literally modify it and sell it to
03:01 - people
03:01 - anyways i'll give you an idea of what i
03:03 - did so here for my advertisement i just
03:05 - submitted some kind of
03:06 - images of the stuff that i created you
03:08 - can see this is a video of a really
03:09 - basic platformer game in uh in python in
03:12 - pi game
03:13 - and i was not making anything
03:14 - complicated anything crazy again super
03:16 - 2d
03:16 - super simple sorry 2d games this was an
03:19 - example of a mini golf
03:20 - game that i made uh this was like a
03:22 - running game like side
03:23 - scrolling kind of thing and then i had
03:25 - tetris right so basic stuff like that
03:27 - but this was enough to get people's
03:29 - attention
03:30 - then what i had was three basic packages
03:32 - so i had the small python graphical game
03:34 - that i would make for you
03:35 - i had the medium python graphical game
03:37 - and then i had the large python
03:39 - graphical game
03:40 - uh now it kind of says what the
03:41 - difference is between them the delivery
03:43 - time the revisions all of that
03:45 - source code comments all that kind of
03:47 - stuff anyways about the gig
03:49 - i'll just kind of read to you what i had
03:50 - here so need a python game
03:52 - completed for school definitely not
03:54 - marketing to finish people's projects
03:57 - i will create a smooth good-looking 2d
03:59 - game for you with python and pie game i
04:01 - have a ton of experience with python and
04:02 - pie game and make games all the time
04:04 - and then i kind of listed some stuff
04:05 - here of what i would do notice i also
04:07 - said i can adjust the price
04:09 - and almost every single person messaged
04:11 - me for a game ended up paying less than
04:13 - i was charging in these packages so they
04:15 - would try to kind of bargain me down
04:17 - and usually i would just give in and say
04:18 - sure you know what i'll do a few for 30
04:19 - bucks or whatever it may be
04:21 - you can see i this is my seller rating
04:23 - or kind of profile on fiverr i'm from
04:25 - canada i was a
04:26 - member since november 2018. the last
04:29 - delivery i did was a year ago i don't
04:30 - freelance anymore and my average
04:32 - response time was an hour add a little
04:33 - description
04:34 - i'll leave this in the link in the
04:35 - description so you guys can check it out
04:37 - if you want to read through everything
04:38 - and then here are the packages right so
04:40 - delivery time you could pay more to have
04:41 - it delivered in less time
04:43 - and all this stuff is like default on
04:45 - fiverr like super simple i didn't have
04:46 - to code any of this out like you just
04:48 - fill in all this information and it
04:50 - makes this page for you
04:52 - anyways i have eight reviews from all
04:54 - the people that i did
04:55 - the uh the projects for or whatever it
04:57 - was that they were asking for
04:59 - and while i was five-star rated and
05:00 - obviously that's helpful people look for
05:02 - high ratings on sites like these
05:04 - so anyways that was the ad this is what
05:06 - i set up and literally this got
05:08 - like hundreds of views a month because i
05:10 - was one of the only people on fiverr
05:13 - that was actually making stuff
05:14 - with pygame now i'm sure after this
05:16 - video this probably isn't going to be
05:18 - the best thing that you guys could do to
05:19 - make money
05:20 - but my point is that if you pick
05:21 - something extremely specific
05:23 - and something that has a small market
05:25 - but a market where like you're the only
05:27 - person supplying something in it
05:29 - then you immediately are going to be a
05:32 - scene right people are going to find
05:33 - your stuff because there's no one else
05:34 - that's doing what you're doing
05:36 - and even today i mean we could probably
05:37 - look this up and check but i don't think
05:39 - there's many people
05:40 - that are making little crappy 2d games
05:42 - in python with the module pi game and
05:44 - well it turns out that people need
05:45 - that done so anyways that was the ad
05:48 - this is what i was doing for people
05:49 - let me now show you what i actually made
05:52 - because you're going to be surprised by
05:53 - how simple these games are
05:54 - and how much i got paid to actually
05:56 - create them alright so just as a
05:57 - refresher
05:58 - these are the orders right here i will
06:00 - try to specify how much i got paid for
06:02 - the projects that i show you i'm not
06:04 - going to show you all of them but i'll
06:05 - just show you a few examples
06:06 - to give you an idea of kind of what
06:08 - people were looking for and how simple
06:10 - these projects really were
06:11 - so anyways all of them were completed
06:13 - all of them were rated five stars and
06:14 - again like the most expensive one i did
06:16 - was 200
06:17 - i'll show you that one but even that one
06:18 - was only like 800 lines of code probably
06:21 - took me like four or five hours to
06:22 - program it
06:23 - so we'll close this up let me head into
06:25 - vs code and then i'll be right back
06:27 - all right so i'm here in vs code i'm
06:28 - just going to show you a few examples of
06:30 - the projects that i made and how much i
06:31 - got paid for each of these
06:33 - uh so the first one that i'm actually
06:34 - going to show you is called ui or that's
06:36 - like what the folder is called that i
06:38 - submitted i just downloaded all of the
06:39 - deliverables that i actually gave to the
06:41 - people
06:42 - so i could show you in this video but
06:44 - this is a really basic
06:46 - user interface in pygame and i remember
06:48 - that what this guy wanted for this
06:50 - specific project was he needed something
06:52 - that he could run on his raspberry pi
06:54 - uh that he would be able to use to grab
06:56 - a user's phone number so he just wanted
06:57 - some like nice looking ui that had some
06:59 - buttons and like an input field
07:01 - and that's literally all this guy wanted
07:02 - so let me go into ui
07:05 - and let's run this code all right so we
07:07 - run this you can see this is what i
07:09 - created this guy paid me 75 bucks to do
07:11 - this
07:12 - and while all you need to do is
07:13 - literally you know type in your phone
07:15 - number whatever it may be
07:16 - you can obviously type more digits than
07:18 - is a valid phone number he didn't ask
07:20 - for that so i didn't implement it
07:22 - you can clear digits like that you can
07:24 - add the pound sign the star sign and
07:26 - when you press ok
07:27 - boom it prints out the phone number
07:28 - right there that was literally all he
07:30 - wanted i don't know what he was using it
07:32 - for but i remember clearly it was like
07:33 - something to do with his raspberry pi
07:35 - anyways 75 bucks for that looking
07:37 - through the code it's literally what 180
07:40 - lines
07:40 - it's really basic i didn't use anything
07:42 - in advance this took me under an hour to
07:44 - make i remember it because i was like
07:46 - pumped that he was going to pay me so
07:47 - much for literally such a simple project
07:49 - anyways closing that one let's move on
07:52 - to another one let's go to tic-tac-toe
07:54 - i think this one is pretty
07:55 - straightforward this one wasn't even pie
07:56 - game so this guy saw
07:58 - that i made like 2d games in pie game
08:00 - and he still messaged me and said hey
08:01 - can you make me tic-tac-toe
08:03 - it needs to be like two-player or like
08:05 - something like that
08:06 - he had a bunch of requirements anyways i
08:09 - made him tic-tac-toe this isn't even in
08:11 - pi game it's like 300 something lines
08:13 - probably took me a few hours to do and
08:15 - i'll look for the price after but i
08:16 - think this was probably again like 75
08:18 - bucks or something like that
08:19 - uh but this is actually running in the
08:21 - console because it's not pi games let's
08:23 - zoom in here
08:24 - it says type s for single player and m
08:26 - for multiplayer and v
08:28 - to view the top high score so let's look
08:29 - at v no high scores to display okay
08:32 - do you want to play again yes type s for
08:34 - single player m for multiplayer
08:36 - let's go s enter the player's name tim
08:39 - you can see we have this little board
08:41 - let's put a 1 in there and there we go
08:43 - now we have an x the computer makes its
08:45 - move
08:45 - there's an o there okay let's put in a 2
08:48 - or let's take the center square maybe so
08:50 - we'll do go with the 5.
08:51 - there he actually blocks us so now we're
08:53 - gonna have to block him that is in
08:55 - square eight okay decides to go up there
08:58 - to block us and i mean we can keep
08:59 - playing and so on
09:00 - you get the idea it's just basic
09:02 - tic-tac-toe this works with single
09:04 - player and multiplayer and well
09:05 - that's what i made now i'm going to say
09:08 - that i got paid 75 bucks for that
09:09 - although let me look on the thing
09:11 - because i don't remember
09:12 - yeah i think it was 75 i'm pretty sure
09:14 - it was this guy right here who paid me
09:16 - for
09:17 - anyways that's that project let me show
09:19 - you another one so this one
09:20 - was actually the most advanced one that
09:22 - i did this one definitely took the most
09:24 - amount of time probably like four or
09:25 - five
09:25 - hours uh and this was uh what was this
09:28 - this was
09:29 - tetris so this one i got paid 200 to do
09:32 - i'm just gonna cd into the folder here
09:34 - so i can do it
09:36 - and let's run this bat file so dot slash
09:39 - run dot bat okay uh let's just have a
09:42 - look at this so this is tetris
09:44 - you can play single player two player
09:46 - single player versus ai
09:47 - i'll show you the ai even though the ai
09:49 - was like not really an ai it was just
09:51 - like somewhat random
09:52 - so let's go three and you can see that
09:54 - we just have tetris
09:56 - i'm on the left hand side as the player
09:58 - and then player two is actually the
09:59 - computer and you can see it's kind of
10:01 - automatically moving i'm not doing any
10:02 - movements with my other hand
10:04 - but anyways this is the idea this is
10:05 - just basic tetris i'm just going to
10:07 - intentionally lose so i can show you the
10:09 - other version
10:10 - but this i remember clearly like not
10:11 - taking me more than a day to finish and
10:13 - getting paid 200 us dollars to do that
10:15 - so not bad whatsoever
10:17 - and this was definitely like the
10:18 - cleanest project that i did it worked
10:20 - the best but obviously i got paid the
10:22 - most amount for it
10:23 - so anyways the point of this video was
10:24 - just to show you that you can make money
10:27 - freelancing
10:28 - to give you kind of an idea of how to do
10:29 - that to give you some like concrete
10:31 - steps or points
10:33 - the first thing you want to do is you
10:34 - need to pick something that you're going
10:35 - to do
10:36 - that's super specific that's pretty easy
10:38 - for you to do that you're decent at
10:40 - and that not many people are doing right
10:42 - if you're not an expert freelancer if
10:44 - you can't build out full stack websites
10:46 - you need to make yourself attractive in
10:48 - a different way that you're cheap
10:50 - that you you know work well with people
10:52 - you have a high rating and you're doing
10:53 - something that
10:54 - not many other people are even willing
10:56 - to do on the freelancing site
10:58 - like creating crappy 2d games in python
11:00 - with the module called
11:02 - pygame so anyways if you guys have any
11:03 - questions please do leave them down
11:05 - below i will leave a link to this gig
11:07 - if you want to take a look at it for
11:09 - yourself but i hope this video was
11:10 - helpful i hope maybe it gave you guys
11:12 - some motivation to start trying to
11:14 - freelance
11:14 - i will tell you that this stuff does not
11:16 - happen overnight
11:17 - sometimes it takes you know weeks or
11:19 - months for someone to reach out to you
11:21 - to get a project but if you're just
11:22 - looking to make some quick side money
11:24 - there's no harm in putting up a little
11:26 - advertisement like this
11:27 - seeing if it gets any traction if it
11:29 - does you know being able to make a quick
11:30 - 50 bucks
11:31 - or like me your first 500 freelancing so
11:34 - i hope this was helpful if it was make
11:35 - sure you leave a like
