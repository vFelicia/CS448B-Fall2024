00:00 - hello everyone and welcome to a brand
00:02 - new tutorial series on ordering a pizza
00:04 - with Python now if you didn't guess from
00:07 - kind of the thumbnail and title what
00:08 - we're gonna be doing here is actually
00:09 - working with an API which stands for an
00:12 - application programming interface we're
00:14 - gonna be learning how we can work with
00:15 - api's how we can kind of dig into a
00:17 - codebase understand what's going on and
00:19 - start using the tools that have been
00:20 - built for us and then obviously we're
00:22 - gonna be using that to well order a
00:23 - pizza so basically what this API is
00:25 - going to allow us to do is create some
00:27 - kind of customer object which is gonna
00:29 - have information about a customer so
00:31 - like name address all of that we can
00:33 - find stores that are close to a customer
00:35 - once we find a specific store that we'd
00:37 - like to order from what we can actually
00:38 - do is look through the menu and then
00:40 - order some specific items from that and
00:41 - then finally we can insert our credit
00:43 - card or payment details and actually
00:45 - place an order and have it arrive at our
00:47 - house so before I go too far I will
00:49 - mention that everything you guys are
00:50 - gonna see here will be up on github so
00:52 - there will be a link in the description
00:53 - you actually need to go to this link
00:55 - once we get into the setup phase of this
00:57 - video which will be in just one minute
00:58 - and just in case anyone gets mad at me
01:00 - here I would like to say this is largely
01:02 - inspired by a YouTube channel called
01:04 - Jarvis Johnson which I'll leave a link
01:06 - to in the description as well he made
01:08 - this video here you might see my mouse
01:09 - hovering over it I wrote a program to
01:11 - order a pizza and I believe that the API
01:13 - were actually using here I forked this
01:15 - from his github repository he's made a
01:18 - few changes to it himself so I don't
01:20 - know exactly what changes are his but
01:21 - you can look through kind of the commits
01:22 - to see what he's done versus what
01:24 - Domino's done you can also see some of
01:26 - the changes I've added to the API to
01:28 - make it a little bit easier for this
01:29 - tutorial series
01:30 - so anyways before we get too far I need
01:32 - to quickly mention the sponsor of the
01:33 - series which is kite so let's get into
01:35 - that before we get started I need to
01:37 - talk about the sponsor of today's video
01:38 - which is kite now kite is a free plug-in
01:41 - for your IDE or text editor uses machine
01:43 - learning to give you the best possible
01:44 - completions for your Python code it's
01:47 - capable of completing entire lines
01:48 - entire function calls and it ranks all
01:51 - of its completions by relevance so you
01:52 - get shown the best ones first even as
01:55 - another feature called intelligence
01:56 - snippets which allows you to quickly tab
01:57 - through the different options and choose
01:59 - which completion you'd like one of the
02:01 - coolest features that comes with kite is
02:02 - called co-pilot now what code pilot does
02:05 - this provide one-click documentation it
02:07 - shows you information about modules
02:09 - classes methods and functions based on
02:11 - your cursor location and
02:13 - best part of kite is that it's free and
02:15 - you can download it at the link below
02:16 - so kite is awesome guys trust me you
02:19 - know I've use it for all of my coding
02:21 - you'll see throughout this video that
02:22 - I'm using kite auto completions which
02:24 - actually makes it a lot easier to
02:26 - program and use api's like this but
02:28 - anyways enough of that I want to go and
02:30 - start talking about how we actually
02:31 - start writing some code and exploring
02:33 - this API so essentially this is not you
02:36 - know a typical Python library this
02:38 - doesn't exist on pip I can't just pip
02:40 - install you know dominoes what you can
02:42 - but it's not gonna have this version
02:43 - what we're actually gonna do is clone
02:45 - this github repository and use this on
02:48 - our system to start writing some code so
02:50 - I've done this you can see you know
02:52 - click the link in the description
02:53 - there's a little bit of documentation on
02:54 - how to do this setup we're gonna run
02:56 - through this together to make sure no
02:57 - one makes any mistakes and then you know
02:59 - if you want to whiz through this and you
03:00 - don't want to wait for all the videos
03:01 - you can get an idea of kind of how some
03:03 - things work by reading through the
03:04 - readme file there is a part of this
03:06 - repository so step one go to the link in
03:09 - the description get on this page and
03:11 - what you're gonna do is click clone or
03:12 - download if you know how to use github
03:14 - you're welcome to clone it by using the
03:16 - link for our purposes we're just gonna
03:18 - download the zip folder so I'll do it
03:20 - like that
03:20 - now I actually already have this
03:22 - downloaded so I'm gonna cancel that but
03:24 - you guys just need to download this
03:25 - github repository somehow and then we'll
03:28 - move on to the next steps so we're gonna
03:30 - close this I actually have my github
03:32 - repository open so this is all the files
03:35 - I've just opened the entire folder and
03:37 - what's called sub line text you guys can
03:39 - use whatever environment you want for
03:40 - the series I'm going to be using sublime
03:42 - text I'll leave a link to that in the
03:43 - description you are an absolute beginner
03:45 - and you know this will be ok if you're
03:47 - an absolute beginner you can go to open
03:49 - folder from sublime text find the folder
03:51 - you want to open in this case I've saved
03:53 - it to my desktop it's called pizza pie
03:54 - or pizza API click open it should open
03:58 - all these files for you and then you can
03:59 - browse through them ok so what we need
04:01 - to do now is actually install the
04:03 - requirements to be able to use this
04:05 - module so we're gonna go into the folder
04:07 - that we just downloaded so whatever you
04:09 - know that github repository lives on
04:11 - your computer wherever you put it what
04:13 - we're gonna do is just get into this
04:14 - interior folder so inside of Pizza API
04:16 - and I'm gonna open up a command prompt
04:18 - window now if you're on Linux you're
04:20 - gonna or a Mac you're gonna open up a
04:22 - terminal window
04:23 - but essentially just open one up I'm
04:25 - gonna type CMD in the top bar here that
04:27 - open a command prompt window like this
04:28 - and we're gonna use pip to install some
04:31 - requirements now if you don't know how
04:32 - to do this or your pip isn't working
04:34 - someone remind me cuz I'll probably
04:35 - forget but I'll leave a card to how to
04:37 - install pip in like the top right or top
04:40 - left hand corner of the screen okay so
04:42 - what I'm gonna do now is simply type
04:43 - this command now it's very important
04:45 - that you make sure you're inside of this
04:47 - directory so where it says users tomate
04:49 - desktop Pete's API make sure you're
04:52 - inside this folder in your you know
04:54 - terminal so you can actually change
04:56 - directories by doing CD and this will
04:58 - allow you to select a directory that you
05:00 - want to go into but the easiest way is
05:02 - just again to go up here
05:03 - type CMD like that hit enter and then it
05:06 - will open at least if you're on Windows
05:07 - so we're gonna do is type pip install -
05:10 - our requirements dot txt I just
05:13 - completed that by hitting tab what this
05:15 - is gonna do is look through the text
05:17 - file called requirements txt which is
05:19 - inside of this directory here and it's
05:22 - going to install the following modules
05:23 - for us so requests PI harm crest
05:26 - whatever all these other ones are you're
05:29 - just going to install them so what we're
05:30 - gonna do is hit enter they're assuming
05:32 - that your pip is working everything's
05:33 - good
05:34 - it should install that and you should be
05:35 - fine now I know I'm getting some like
05:37 - weird errors popping up here at my
05:38 - computer I actually have everything
05:40 - installed already so there's nothing to
05:42 - really be too worried about but that is
05:44 - essentially how this works so pip
05:46 - install - art requirement stop I get the
05:49 - requirements and we should be good to go
05:50 - okay so now what we're gonna do is we're
05:53 - actually going to just open up this
05:54 - folder and create a new Python file and
05:57 - actually start working and looking at
05:58 - this API so I've opened all of this up
06:00 - here and I've create a new file called
06:02 - tutorial dot P now what we're gonna do
06:05 - in this file is just do a few imports
06:07 - and stuff but before we do that I want
06:09 - to kind of explore what this API is kind
06:11 - of some of the features of it and how it
06:13 - works so let's go to this github page
06:15 - before and let's actually read through
06:17 - this readme dot txt file or whatever it
06:19 - is that's up here and see kind of how
06:21 - this actually works so we can see this
06:23 - is a Python R apple wrapper for the
06:25 - Domino's Pizza API it's a port of the
06:28 - pizza node.js module and you know you
06:31 - can go through all that so what we are
06:33 - seeing right now is that the first step
06:36 - to actually working with this API is to
06:39 - create a customer
06:40 - object so it says customer equals
06:42 - customer and then we can insert some
06:44 - information so it looks like lastname
06:45 - firstname we have an email I believe
06:49 - this is a phone number and address and I
06:52 - think that's it for the customer
06:53 - information it says once we have a
06:55 - customer what we can do is use the store
06:58 - locator module to find the closest store
07:01 - to the customer by doing a command like
07:03 - this then what we can do once we have
07:05 - that store is called the get menu what
07:09 - this is going to do I guess has returned
07:10 - to us some kind of menu object and then
07:12 - we can search the menu for specific
07:14 - items and in this case it says we have
07:15 - you know coke is what we're searching
07:17 - for now when we do that it prints to the
07:20 - console a bunch of codes followed by
07:22 - what the actual item name is and then
07:24 - the price of the item these are the
07:26 - codes that we're actually going to use
07:27 - to be able to place an order and kind of
07:29 - select the different items that we want
07:31 - to put you know in our order so notice
07:34 - here then we go to the next line and we
07:35 - can create a new order so order begin
07:37 - custom order we give the customer and
07:39 - the local Domino's we want to order from
07:41 - and then here we type the codes that
07:43 - correspond to what we would have found
07:45 - up here when we were searching through
07:46 - the menu and we add these items to our
07:49 - order so in this case we have a 12-inch
07:50 - pizza we have an extra Mariana cup or
07:53 - whatever that marinara I think that's
07:55 - how you say it and a two ounce bottle of
07:57 - coke or 20 ounce bottle of coke so we
08:00 - can remove items by doing ordered remove
08:02 - and then our last step here is to have a
08:04 - credit card object created and then
08:06 - place our order using that credit card
08:08 - and I also place the order I guess at
08:11 - the local Domino's so that is
08:13 - essentially kind of the steps we need to
08:14 - go through and that is kind of how this
08:16 - API work so this is what's the
08:18 - QuickStart usually this is good to read
08:20 - to understand kind of how these things
08:22 - are and what like what this is so let's
08:24 - now talk about how we actually start
08:25 - using this so we'll notice that actually
08:28 - there's a folder inside our kind of
08:30 - directory here called Pizza APY so pizza
08:34 - pie I guess right and we can see that
08:36 - there's all these different files in
08:37 - here we can actually go ahead and open
08:39 - them up and have a look at what they do
08:40 - and I would recommend that you guys read
08:41 - through a few of these if you want to
08:43 - understand kind of how this works on a
08:45 - deeper level now we have this a knit top
08:47 - pie file as well and notice in here we
08:50 - have all these imports essentially
08:52 - importing all of the different files
08:53 - that are else
08:54 - in this directory now when we create
08:56 - this init Pi file or when this and
08:58 - nip/tuck PI files inside this folder
08:59 - what this actually means is this folder
09:01 - is what we call a Python package now
09:04 - this is good because this actually
09:06 - allows us to import the package as a
09:08 - whole rather than importing individual
09:11 - Python files like we might have had to
09:13 - done or might have had to do before so
09:16 - if when we create a new file what we're
09:19 - gonna do is simply put that file
09:20 - somewhere in this kind of exterior
09:22 - directory and that's exactly where I put
09:24 - this tutorial PI file and in here what
09:27 - we can simply do if we want to use all
09:29 - of the different parts of this Pizza API
09:31 - you know kind of package that we've
09:33 - created is simply import pizza a py like
09:37 - that now by doing that that's going to
09:39 - allow us to have access to all of the
09:42 - different files that are inside of here
09:43 - and we're gonna use some of these
09:44 - different files to you know create
09:46 - objects create a customer and all of
09:48 - that and what we're actually gonna get
09:49 - started with here is just making a
09:51 - customer object seeing how this kind of
09:53 - works and then we'll move from there
09:55 - into some more detailed stuff later on
09:56 - okay so I've imported pizza apo a py now
10:01 - what I'm actually gonna do is change
10:02 - this import statement around a little
10:03 - bit and import a customer object because
10:06 - that's where we need to get started when
10:07 - we need to order a pizza so I'm gonna
10:08 - say from Pizza API the import customer
10:12 - like that and now what I'm going to do
10:14 - is create my first customer object now
10:16 - to do this what I'm gonna do is just say
10:18 - customer equals customer like that and
10:21 - then when I put my brackets here I'm
10:23 - gonna start typing the different
10:24 - parameters that this customer object
10:26 - takes now for example right like when we
10:28 - looked at if I can get out of this at
10:30 - our github repository we saw that it's
10:33 - looked like last name first name and
10:35 - then all these different things right
10:36 - but it doesn't actually tell us what all
10:38 - these parameters are we don't really
10:40 - know what we need to feed into the
10:42 - customer and since there's no real
10:43 - documentation for this other than
10:45 - whatever is on this QuickStart page what
10:47 - we actually need to do is look at the
10:49 - code ourselves to figure out what we're
10:51 - gonna need to do with this customer
10:52 - object so what I'm gonna do is click on
10:54 - this customer dot PI file it's inside of
10:56 - Pizza API like this and I'm actually
10:58 - just gonna look at the initialization
11:00 - inside this class and we can see that we
11:03 - have a few different properties here and
11:05 - these are the order of which
11:06 - expecting different arguments so in this
11:08 - case we can say you know this is the
11:10 - customer who orders a pizza that's what
11:12 - this customer object is and in the
11:13 - initialization we have first name last
11:16 - name email phone and address so that's
11:20 - what we need to feed to our customer
11:21 - object so in this case what I'm gonna do
11:23 - is put my first name which is Tim I'm
11:25 - gonna put my last name which I'm just
11:27 - gonna go with tech for now because I
11:28 - don't really feel like giving you guys
11:29 - my last name then what else did we need
11:31 - so we had first name last name we need
11:33 - email so I'm just gonna say Tim at Tech
11:37 - with Tim dog net which is actually an
11:39 - email of mine if you want to send me
11:40 - something phone number which 9:05 I'm
11:44 - gonna put in some random stuff just so
11:46 - that you guys don't call me on my cell
11:47 - phone and then finally an address and
11:49 - this address needs to come in in a
11:51 - certain form now if we're ordering from
11:54 - different countries our address might
11:55 - look a little bit different right so
11:57 - what we actually need for the address is
11:59 - a well I'm just gonna go here and
12:00 - reference this is we just need the
12:02 - street we need the state or province
12:05 - depending on where you live or sorry
12:08 - city we need the state or province then
12:09 - we need a zip code or a postal code now
12:12 - I live in Canada so for this address
12:14 - what I'm gonna do is actually just find
12:16 - one online and just throw it in here so
12:17 - I don't give you guys my actual address
12:19 - but if you live in the States just know
12:21 - this is gonna be a little bit different
12:22 - for you right you're gonna need to put a
12:23 - zip code which I believe is five digits
12:25 - whereas my postal code is gonna have
12:27 - numbers in it and it's gonna be six
12:29 - characters long okay so I'm in sort of
12:33 - inserted the address here which is forty
12:35 - Bay Street Toronto Ontario m5g and we're
12:39 - gonna actually need to do a comma here
12:40 - so what we're gonna do is make sure that
12:42 - our address is you know kind of
12:43 - separated correctly so we have that
12:45 - street number and name so forty Bay
12:47 - Street we have the city we have the
12:49 - province then we have the postal code
12:50 - and notice that even though I live in
12:52 - Canada and typically the postal codes
12:53 - are separated by space I've not done
12:55 - that in this instance so this is
12:56 - important we need to make sure the input
12:58 - looks like this and if you know what
13:00 - this address is if you guys live in
13:02 - Canada leave a comment down below
13:04 - because I think that'll be kind of fun
13:05 - if you guys guess what that is okay so
13:07 - now we've created a customer object
13:08 - what's the next step so let's have a
13:10 - look at our github here and we can see
13:13 - that the next step is once we have a
13:14 - customer object is to find our local
13:16 - Domino's so what we're gonna do is I'm
13:19 - literally just gonna copy this line
13:20 - here so my local Domino's equals store
13:23 - locator dot find closest store to
13:25 - customer and we're gonna use this so
13:28 - let's go back into a sub line and let's
13:30 - paste that there but what I need to do
13:32 - is make sure that I import stoat store
13:34 - locator first so I'm gonna do comma
13:36 - paste and put store locator up top here
13:39 - so now we can use this and what I'm
13:41 - actually gonna do is simply print my
13:44 - local donut Domino's and again you know
13:46 - you guys probably might realize that
13:48 - while I'm typing or getting these
13:49 - completions those completions are from
13:50 - kite which is the sponsor of this
13:52 - tutorial series okay so let's have a
13:54 - look at this so let's actually run this
13:56 - I'm just gonna hit control B what's my
13:59 - error here ah okay I need to do
14:01 - something I'll be back in one sector
14:03 - spine to finding a way to show you guys
14:04 - how to run this code okay so I've got my
14:06 - code running now I apologize that this
14:08 - is a little bit small for you guys but
14:10 - you can see now that when I print in our
14:12 - done python tutorial pi so that's how
14:14 - I'm running my code I get a store and
14:17 - address and then I get open now yes or
14:20 - no so this is apparently or I guess not
14:22 - apparently this is the closest store to
14:25 - the customer that we put in and it's
14:27 - telling us the closest Domino's is at
14:28 - 344 Front Street West unit 107 Toronto
14:33 - Ontario open now yes so mess around with
14:35 - your address in here or some other
14:37 - different addresses and use this kind of
14:39 - code and see if it's giving you
14:41 - different results and if it's working
14:42 - because this is where we're gonna end
14:44 - off the video for now so anyways I hope
14:46 - you guys enjoyed this so far I know we
14:47 - haven't done much in the next video we
14:49 - can do a lot more programming but I want
14:51 - to get you guys kind of comfortable with
14:52 - the idea of using an API working with an
14:55 - API understanding where some of this
14:57 - code is coming from for example this is
14:59 - the customer class in here so you can
15:02 - see kind of how this works and then the
15:04 - store locator class is inside of store
15:07 - and you can guess kind of how we're
15:08 - actually you know getting that
15:10 - information and read through kind of the
15:12 - bottom you know underlying code to what
15:14 - we're writing up here so anyways that
15:15 - has been it I hope you enjoyed if you
15:17 - did as always leave a like subscribe to
15:18 - the channel and I will see you guys in
15:19 - the next tutorial
