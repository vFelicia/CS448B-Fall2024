00:00 - almost all python programmers start by
00:01 - learning how the print statement works
00:03 - however they don't actually learn how
00:05 - the print statement works what i mean by
00:06 - this is that the prince name it does
00:07 - something that we don't see it prints a
00:09 - new line after it prints what you're
00:11 - printing out in fact this new line is
00:13 - actually a special character that's
00:14 - invisible to you called backslash n
00:17 - notice now if i print backslash n
00:18 - another line happens and if i go
00:20 - backslash and again another line happens
00:22 - so what we can actually do is override
00:24 - what's printed at the end of our print
00:26 - statement so it no longer prints this
00:28 - backslash n to move us down to the next
00:30 - line let me show you you can pass this
00:32 - end equals and then whatever you want in
00:33 - this case i'm going to do a pipe to the
00:35 - print statement and now after it prints
00:37 - out your content it will print out a
00:38 - pipe now in the same way when we have
00:40 - multiple things being printed here we
00:41 - have a default separator of a space if
00:44 - we want the separator between these
00:45 - items to be different we can use sep
00:47 - equals and then whatever we want so in
00:48 - this case i'll just go with a bunch of
00:50 - x's now notice we're going to have a
00:52 - bunch of x's in between our two words
00:54 - hopefully you found this helpful if you
00:55 - did follow for more
