00:00 - in this video i'll show you how to
00:01 - generate a random number in python to do
00:03 - this we need to import the random module
00:05 - then we can say num is equal to random
00:07 - dot rand int
00:09 - and then the start and stop of our range
00:12 - so if i start at 0 and end at 10 then i
00:14 - can generate a random number between 1
00:15 - and 10 including both 1 and 10. let's
00:18 - print out num and do it a few times and
00:20 - notice we get a bunch of random numbers
00:22 - now another way to do this is using rand
00:24 - range if you use rand range it will
00:26 - start at this number stop at this number
00:28 - meaning this is not included in the
00:29 - possible numbers so right now we'll
00:31 - generate a number between zero to nine
00:33 - and then you can also include what's
00:34 - known as a step now the step by default
00:36 - is one but if you put a step here it
00:38 - will only generate numbers within the
00:39 - range that have this step so what i mean
00:41 - by that is we'll have zero two 6 8 as
00:44 - possible numbers for this so if i run
00:45 - this now we only get even numbers
00:47 - because we're only generating numbers by
00:49 - stepping by 2. hopefully you found this
00:51 - helpful if you did then follow for more
