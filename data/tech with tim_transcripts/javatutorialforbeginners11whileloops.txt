00:00 - hello and welcome back so in this video
00:02 - we are going to be talking about while
00:04 - loops now while loops are very similar
00:06 - to for loops anything you do with the
00:07 - for loop you can indeed do with the
00:10 - while loop that being said they do have
00:11 - different use cases in terms of where
00:13 - they're most useful but just remember
00:15 - anything you do with the for loop you
00:17 - can do with the while loop anything you
00:19 - do with the while loop you can do with
00:20 - the for loop they're completely
00:21 - interchangeable and if you only had one
00:23 - of them in programming you'd still be
00:24 - able to do everything it just might be
00:26 - not as I don't know nice to code that's
00:30 - the right word for it or elegant it's
00:32 - probably the better word so a while loop
00:34 - is gonna work when you typically don't
00:36 - know how many times you want to loop
00:38 - through something so it's kind of like a
00:39 - question like you know it's gonna be
00:42 - based on this condition but you're not
00:44 - really sure like if a for loop is more
00:47 - like you know you're gonna do it a set
00:48 - amount of times a while loop is it could
00:50 - change based on the program based on
00:52 - user input okay something like that so
00:54 - what we're gonna do here with this while
00:55 - loop is I'm just gonna set one up and
00:57 - then we'll just talk about exactly what
00:58 - it does so in this case what I want my
01:01 - while loop to do is I want it to just
01:03 - continually keep asking the user for
01:04 - input until they give me like a certain
01:07 - word or like one or of two words okay so
01:10 - in this case what I mean - I'm just
01:11 - gonna say let's see maybe just get
01:14 - answers me faster say int x equals SC
01:18 - dot next int like this okay and what I'm
01:23 - going to do is I'm just gonna keep
01:24 - looping through until they type the
01:25 - number ten okay so I can do this is you
01:28 - just type the keyword while in here and
01:30 - then in these brackets is gonna be your
01:33 - condition now this is why I focus so
01:36 - much about conditions in the first two
01:38 - videos because they go a lot with if
01:40 - loops while loops for loops so whenever
01:42 - while this condition is true then we're
01:45 - gonna run the loop so in this case I'm
01:47 - gonna say Wow X does not equal 10 okay
01:54 - yeah exactly
01:56 - that's true so in if they type in ten
01:58 - then it will not continue to do this
02:00 - otherwise we will continue to do this so
02:03 - that means I'm also gonna have to get
02:05 - the int in here because every time that
02:08 - we run this loop we want to continue
02:10 - getting X so and this case we ready have
02:12 - X define we just do X
02:13 - and what I'm gonna do is if they don't
02:16 - type in ten I'm simply gonna tell them
02:18 - like type in ten so we'll just say dot
02:20 - print L and in this case I will just say
02:25 - type ten dot dot dot and you know what
02:29 - we're also just gonna print out because
02:32 - I like to do this we'll just do
02:34 - system.out.println and this case will
02:37 - say type a number these are knows what
02:41 - we're looking for okay
02:42 - and that means we're also gonna have to
02:43 - print this here and it should just be
02:47 - prints not print on println my apologies
02:49 - okay so again the way this is gonna work
02:51 - is we're just gonna continually keep
02:53 - looping through this until eventually
02:54 - the user types in ten in that case we
02:57 - will break it okay and we will not do
03:00 - this anymore so let's run this type in
03:02 - number let's type four so as type 10
03:04 - down to dot type number type five
03:06 - doesn't work type 10 there we go
03:09 - and we broke out of the loop and I no
03:10 - longer asked us for that number now
03:12 - these are actually really simple um it
03:14 - just Wow
03:15 - this condition is true do you everything
03:17 - that's in here and that's all you really
03:18 - have to know about while loops now again
03:21 - like we can what I was saying we can do
03:23 - everything that with for loops with
03:25 - while loops because we can also count in
03:27 - while ups as well so just like I did
03:28 - before I can do something like int count
03:30 - equals zero and then every time we run
03:32 - this loop you get to say count plus plus
03:34 - and then maybe at the end of our loop we
03:36 - wanted to do like tell them how many
03:38 - times they messed up okay
03:40 - what am I saying print system dot out
03:42 - dot println and in this case we'll just
03:45 - say you tried tired you tried and then
03:52 - plus count plus time this can make sure
03:57 - we add a little space here all right so
03:59 - now if we run this and we'll say like
04:00 - one two three and ten you tried three
04:05 - times until like eventually you got it
04:07 - okay so that's like a really simple way
04:09 - to do stuff with while loops now you
04:11 - guys might notice that this code here
04:13 - like this these lines are repeated up
04:16 - here so I have this index and this type
04:18 - of number so how can I do this without
04:20 - repeating those lines because I don't
04:23 - want it have to type like what if I
04:24 - wanted to ask a a ton of different
04:26 - questions and then dude while loop I
04:28 - don't want to have the same section of
04:29 - code appearing multiple times so there's
04:32 - actually something called a do-while
04:34 - loop so what I'm gonna do is I'm just
04:35 - gonna erase all this and I'm going to
04:38 - set up this a do-while loop and it's
04:40 - pretty much what it says we're gonna do
04:42 - everything while this is true and you'll
04:46 - see how it works in just a second so I'm
04:47 - gonna type the keyword do you brackets
04:49 - and now everything in this brackets is
04:51 - what is gonna happen while the condition
04:56 - that I put down here is true so the
04:58 - condition here is gonna be the same well
05:00 - X does not equal 10 we're gonna do
05:03 - everything in here so now you can see
05:05 - this is working fine there's no issues
05:07 - and what I'm going to simply do is I'm
05:08 - going to take this these two lines here
05:10 - I don't need that scanner because we're
05:12 - not gonna redefine that every time and
05:13 - I'm going to paste them in here and what
05:16 - this is gonna allow us to do now is X
05:19 - does not equal 0 create local gosh okay
05:23 - uh let's just do this int X and then
05:28 - okay perfect they reel so sorry that was
05:31 - just a quick issue but what this is
05:32 - going to allow us to do is we're gonna
05:35 - do this once no matter what this is
05:37 - gonna happen once because we're gonna do
05:39 - this and at this point X is not equal to
05:41 - 10 so we're automatically gonna do this
05:43 - once which means we don't have to have
05:44 - an up top and then down below so we do
05:46 - that and then we check the condition if
05:48 - it's true we'll do it again
05:50 - yeah and if it's not then we will break
05:53 - so we can do this we'll say type a
05:55 - number let's do 4 let's do 5 let's do
05:57 - negative 0 is that number yeah okay
06:00 - and 10 and there we go we break out of
06:02 - the loop and everything is working fine
06:04 - and that is pretty much it for while
06:08 - loops again if you want to set one up to
06:10 - look like a for loop then you'd
06:11 - literally just have to create a variable
06:13 - in this case to say like index equals 0
06:16 - you can set up a while loop so you say
06:18 - wow and you say X is less than or equal
06:22 - to 10
06:23 - and then in here you just say X plus
06:26 - equals 1 or plus equals 2 or whatever
06:29 - value you want to add to it and then you
06:31 - can just do what you would do in the for
06:32 - loop underneath your increment or you
06:34 - could put the increment typically you
06:35 - put it at the end so at the end of the
06:37 - loop you're adding 1
06:38 - check okay but that's pretty much been
06:40 - it for a while loops that are very
06:41 - simple in the next video what are we
06:44 - gonna go over let me check my sheet here
06:46 - we're gonna go over sets and collections
06:48 - like we're gonna talk about like hash
06:50 - tables and stuff getting a bit more
06:52 - advanced and moving away from some like
06:54 - the basic stuff in Java that being said
06:56 - if you guys enjoyed the video please

06:59 - and I will see you again in the next one
