00:00 - if you're trying to become a developer
00:01 - chances are you're making this one
00:03 - mistake and it's likely what's holding
00:05 - you back from Landing a job now that
00:07 - mistake is jumping from topic to topic
00:09 - and field to field without really
00:12 - understanding what it is that you need
00:13 - to focus on now that's exactly why I'm
00:15 - making this video once you've learned
00:17 - the fundamentals of programming you need
00:19 - to work on specializing so you're
00:21 - actually qualified for the jobs that are
00:23 - out there now the most popular
00:24 - specializations to choose from are front
00:27 - end backend or devops sure there are
00:30 - hundreds of different areas that you
00:31 - could get into but most of them are
00:32 - going to be rooted from one of these
00:34 - three specializations so now let me
00:36 - break down the difference between each
00:38 - of these three Fields you understand
00:40 - which one to go with and how to actually
00:42 - start making some serious progress so
00:45 - let's start with a quick overview front
00:47 - end is all about building user
00:48 - interfaces working with designers and
00:50 - bringing a user experience to life
00:53 - you're going to be doing a lot of
00:54 - styling layouts and overall you'll be
00:56 - responsible for the look and feel of an
00:58 - application or product
01:00 - now backend is all about data and
01:02 - security you'll be responsible for
01:04 - writing code that's mostly hidden from
01:05 - the user but that's critical to the
01:07 - infastructure of an organization or a
01:09 - product now with backend you're going to
01:11 - be working with databases authentication
01:14 - performance and designing and
01:16 - implementing scalable systems and then
01:18 - we have devops which is about unifying
01:20 - development and operations devops is all
01:23 - about making the life cycle Faster by
01:25 - building automations doing continuous
01:27 - deployment and testing monitoring and
01:29 - and logging and really responsible for
01:32 - all of the operations you need to
01:33 - perform to actually bring a product into
01:36 - the hands of users now regardless of
01:38 - which of these paths you choose you'll
01:39 - eventually do some devops work you'll
01:42 - probably have some kind of application
01:43 - that you actually want to push out to
01:45 - production now when you do that that's
01:47 - going to involve configuring monitoring
01:49 - and building an entire pipeline that
01:51 - allows you to do continuous integration
01:53 - and continuous deployment now I'm not
01:55 - going to lie to you this is a huge pain
01:57 - now fortunately for us the sponsor of
01:59 - this video jet brains has a solution
02:01 - with Team City pipelines this offers a
02:04 - new intelligent approach to CI and CD by

02:32 - cut your runtime by up to 40% thanks to
02:35 - the smart pipeline optimization it can
02:37 - even suggest optimal configurations and
02:39 - provide automatic test paralyzation get
02:42 - started with Team City pipelines today
02:44 - for free by clicking the link in the
02:46 - description and signing up with your
02:48 - GitHub account now let's get right into
02:50 - what you guys care about which of these
02:51 - fields is the easiest to get into and
02:53 - which of them pay the best now I'll
02:55 - start with difficulty and kind of the
02:57 - ease of entrance into these three
02:59 - different fields now the truth is that
03:01 - your personality type and what you're
03:02 - interested in is really going to dictate
03:04 - which of these is easier for you to
03:06 - master but regardless I'm going to give
03:08 - you the kind of common opinion on which
03:10 - of these is easier so we can start with
03:12 - front end development which is typically
03:14 - considered the easiest field to break
03:15 - into now the reason for that is the text
03:18 - stack you need to learn is the simplest
03:20 - to pick up it's also very visual that
03:22 - means as a beginner you can immediately
03:24 - see exactly what it is that you're
03:26 - building and people who are just getting
03:27 - into programming find that this is a bit
03:29 - more intuitive and it's easier for them
03:31 - to pick up and learn these different
03:33 - languages now with that in mind front
03:35 - end development is extremely in demand
03:38 - companies always need front end
03:39 - developers but that also means that
03:41 - there's a lot of competition this is
03:43 - usually what most people will start
03:44 - learning if they want to break into the
03:46 - tech industry really quickly so you're
03:48 - going to be competing with a lot of
03:49 - other Junior Engineers for those
03:50 - entrylevel positions that said it's
03:53 - still a great one to go with and it
03:55 - probably is one of the fastest ways to
03:56 - get a tech job now back end on the other
03:59 - hand is slightly more difficult to break
04:01 - into and that's because you need to have
04:03 - a strong understanding of serers side
04:05 - programming languages database systems
04:07 - performance and building scalable
04:09 - systems these topics are typically
04:11 - harder to master or at least people find
04:13 - them more difficult and I will say that
04:15 - there are slightly less roles for
04:17 - back-end developers with that said there
04:19 - is still a ton of demand and because
04:21 - this is more difficult you'll often find
04:23 - that there is less competition because
04:25 - there's less qualified people for the
04:27 - role now with backend there's so many
04:29 - different Stacks that you could learn so
04:31 - many different languages you can pick up
04:33 - and that allows you to really specialize
04:34 - yourself for certain types of roles and
04:37 - you can stand out compared to a more
04:38 - generic front-end rule where everyone's
04:40 - going to know JavaScript everyone's
04:42 - going to know HTML so compared to front
04:44 - end slightly less roles but it could be
04:47 - easier if not the same to land a
04:49 - position in backend development now
04:51 - lastly we have devops now this is
04:53 - definitely the most difficult to break
04:54 - into and that's because you need to have
04:56 - a strong understanding of both
04:58 - development and operation
05:00 - so building automations continuous
05:02 - integration continuous deployment
05:04 - monitoring but also cloud services and
05:07 - security Now devops roles do typically
05:09 - require some level of experience and
05:11 - that's because you're working in
05:12 - critical production grade environments
05:15 - and if you do make a mistake that's
05:16 - going to have a huge consequence on the
05:18 - business or the application you're
05:20 - support with that said though there is
05:22 - typically much higher demand for devops
05:24 - role than there is Supply and that's
05:26 - because less people go into this field
05:28 - and it's much harder to F so if you are
05:30 - someone who's willing to commit the time
05:32 - and really understand these devops
05:34 - principles you can definitely be out
05:36 - competing a lot of people for jobs and
05:38 - you can find yourself in a position
05:39 - where you really have the leverage and
05:41 - people want to hire you because there's
05:43 - just less qualified people in that field
05:45 - that's what I found and that's what I've
05:47 - heard talking to other devops Engineers
05:49 - typically they can demand a higher
05:50 - salary but it is a harder or higher
05:53 - barrier to entry and does maybe require
05:55 - that they first had a role in some kind
05:56 - of backend or front-end job before so so
05:59 - now let's dive into the pay now
06:01 - truthfully the Pay Here is not a huge
06:03 - difference and I wouldn't pick one of
06:05 - these rules simply because you see a
06:06 - higher average salary whatever you think
06:08 - you can get into and master the quickest
06:11 - or that's going to be of interest to you
06:12 - is what I would highly recommend going
06:14 - with regardless though let me share with
06:16 - you the figures for the pay for
06:17 - front-end backend and devops Engineers
06:20 - so front-end Engineers are typically
06:21 - paid the least and the average salary in
06:23 - the United States for a frontend
06:25 - engineer this includes seniors Juniors
06:27 - just everything the complete average is
06:30 - $17,000 now for backend Engineers this
06:32 - is
06:33 - $116,000 and for devops this is
06:36 - estimated at
06:37 - $138,000 so you can see the devops is
06:40 - significantly higher but again a lot of
06:42 - those roles are not junior or entry
06:44 - level meaning you would need some
06:45 - experience or you'd at least need to
06:47 - learn a ton to be able to land those
06:49 - positions now with all that in mind as
06:51 - you climb the experience ladder as a
06:53 - front-end backend or devups engineer you
06:55 - can get paid a ton of money if you're a
06:57 - really good front-end engineer you could
06:59 - easily making hundreds of thousands of
07:01 - dollars same with backend same with
07:03 - devops so don't pick one of these
07:05 - positions simply because of the pay you
07:06 - just saw there remember that if you get
07:08 - really good in one of these fields
07:10 - you're going to earn a lot more than you
07:11 - would if you were just a decent back-end
07:13 - developer or a decent developer in
07:15 - another field that didn't interest you
07:17 - as much whatever you think you can get
07:19 - good at what is really your interest and
07:21 - what you're going to like to learn a lot
07:22 - about is where you're going to make the
07:24 - most amount of money so keep those
07:25 - figures in mind but don't pick one
07:27 - purely because of the salary they're all
07:29 - High salaries and the truth is again if
07:31 - you master one of these fields you're
07:32 - going to get paid a lot so now what I'm
07:35 - going to do is break down the
07:36 - responsibilities and kind of text stack
07:38 - and languages that you need to know for
07:39 - each of these roles so you can
07:41 - understand the full picture of what
07:42 - you'll actually be doing and you have
07:44 - some better information to make your
07:46 - decision so let's start with front-end
07:48 - as a frontend developer your
07:49 - responsibilities are the following don't
07:51 - mind if I look at my screen I just have
07:53 - some of the written down so I'm going to
07:54 - read them out we have developing user
07:56 - interfaces optimizing user experience
07:59 - work working with designers and also
08:01 - sometimes backend Engineers ensuring
08:03 - front-end performance and testing and
08:05 - debugging now this is probably the
08:07 - simplest job description but generally
08:09 - speaking what you're doing is being
08:11 - responsible for how the product looks
08:13 - and feels a lot of people overlook this
08:15 - but a lot of what you're doing is
08:17 - fine-tuning user experience how does the
08:19 - website feel to use how does the app
08:22 - feel how does the game feel everything
08:24 - that a user touches that's what you're
08:26 - responsible for and there's a lot more
08:28 - to that than simply design even simple
08:30 - things like how far do I need to move
08:32 - the mouse to get to a button does the
08:34 - button have a hover effect does it feel
08:36 - tactile these are things you're going to
08:38 - be considering a lot as a front-end
08:40 - engineer and you're also going to be
08:41 - dealing with responsive design how do we
08:43 - make sure this app works on all
08:45 - different kinds of systems how do we
08:47 - make it accessible so that people that
08:49 - have maybe hearing issues or visual
08:51 - issues are able to utilize our
08:52 - application there's a lot of things you
08:54 - need to do as a frontend developer but a
08:56 - lot of it is simply building that user
08:58 - interface it's very Visual and it's
09:00 - really easy to see what you need to do
09:02 - and when something looks good or when it
09:04 - looks bad regardless some of the
09:06 - languages and Technologies you'll need
09:07 - to know as a front-end developer include
09:09 - the following HTML CSS JavaScript most
09:13 - likely typescript as well and then
09:15 - you're going to have to know about
09:16 - different Frameworks so depending on the
09:18 - company you work for maybe that's react
09:20 - maybe that's Vue maybe that's angular
09:23 - there's a bunch of different front-end
09:24 - Frameworks and these are constantly
09:26 - changing and as a front-end developer
09:28 - you need to keep up with all of those
09:29 - Trends even things like serers side
09:31 - rendering bundling frontend code when
09:33 - you start to get to more mid and senior
09:35 - level positions there's a lot more that
09:37 - you need to think about but it all kind
09:39 - of stems and starts from those languages
09:41 - that I just shared so now let's move on
09:43 - to the backend developer now as a
09:45 - backend developer here are some of your
09:46 - core responsibilities you're going to be
09:48 - doing server side Development building
09:50 - out apis you're going to be working with
09:52 - databases and database management you
09:54 - also need to do application integration
09:57 - so how does the backend work for various
09:58 - different types typ of front ends then
10:00 - you'll be working with security you'll
10:02 - likely work with performance and then
10:04 - you're going to be doing some testing of
10:05 - course and deployment and maintenance
10:08 - now you'll notice here that sometimes
10:10 - your devops and your backend roles will
10:12 - share responsibilities and that's
10:13 - because a lot of companies don't have
10:15 - dedicated devops teams and they just
10:17 - bring a lot of the devops
10:19 - responsibilities to the backend team so
10:21 - even though you shouldn't necessarily
10:22 - have to do all of this as a backend
10:24 - developer sometimes you will be doing a
10:26 - little bit of devops work and if you're
10:28 - a devops engineer sometimes you will be
10:29 - doing a bit of backend work so keep that
10:31 - in mind some of the responsibilities are
10:33 - Blended depending on the type of company
10:36 - how large it is and how many people they
10:37 - have working in the different roles now
10:40 - in terms of Frameworks and Technologies
10:41 - you'll likely need to know you're going
10:43 - to have to know some backend languages
10:45 - now this really varies because there's
10:46 - so many different languages and text
10:48 - Stacks you could be using you could be
10:50 - using something like Python and then
10:51 - you'd be expected probably to know about
10:53 - Jango flask maybe fast API some of those
10:56 - different Frameworks you might be
10:57 - working with rust C+ plus PHP java.net
11:02 - go there's so many different stacks and
11:04 - that's actually what's kind of nice
11:05 - about backend you can really optimize
11:08 - your profile and your skill set for
11:10 - specific jobs and you could be for
11:12 - example an expert. net developer or Java
11:14 - developer not just a general back-end
11:17 - developer whereas typically with
11:19 - front-end most your front-end Engineers
11:20 - are going to know a lot of these
11:21 - different Frameworks and they're going
11:22 - to have a similar skill set yes
11:24 - obviously you can specialize but with
11:26 - backend there's a lot more options and
11:28 - there's a lot of different stack that
11:29 - you'll want to learn if you go look at
11:31 - job positions you'll see that people
11:33 - will specifically look for backend
11:34 - python developers or backend Ruby
11:36 - developers or backend PHP developers so
11:39 - you do need to kind of narrow it down
11:40 - and pick a specific backend language or
11:42 - backend text deck beyond that you're
11:44 - going to need to know about SQL and
11:46 - nosql databases how do they work how do
11:48 - you write SQL code what's the difference
11:50 - between them some jobs want you to know
11:52 - about specific databases like MySQL
11:54 - postris SQL mongodb Etc other than that
11:58 - things like web server Technologies so
12:00 - engine X Apachi then API development
12:03 - developing rest apis graphql cloud
12:06 - services so things like AWS Azure uh
12:09 - what are the other ones we have here
12:10 - Google Cloud some companies want you to
12:12 - be familiar with one of those different
12:14 - ecosystems and then finally we might
12:16 - have containerization and virtualization
12:18 - this is something that usually will
12:20 - happen more on the devop side but as a
12:21 - backend developer you might need to know
12:23 - this as well understanding Docker
12:25 - kubernetes deployments again sometimes
12:27 - those responsibilities and rol kind of
12:29 - blend together so lastly let's talk
12:31 - about devops now as a devops engineer
12:33 - you'll be responsible for continuous
12:35 - integration and continuous deployment so
12:37 - testing the code making sure that it's
12:39 - working that it's functioning and then
12:41 - continually deploying that to the users
12:43 - or to the production environment next
12:45 - infrastructure as code monitoring and
12:47 - logging Performance Tuning doing
12:50 - security and compliance so if you work
12:52 - for a really really big company there's
12:53 - a lot of compliance that you need to
12:55 - consider that's something to keep in
12:56 - mind Cloud Server management so again
12:59 - working with these uh platforms like AWS
13:02 - Google Cloud Azure whatever it is that
13:04 - company's using and then disaster
13:06 - recovery and backup there's a lot of
13:08 - other things that could come in here but
13:09 - those are the main topics and things
13:11 - that you'll likely be responsible for
13:13 - now in terms of Technologies you will
13:14 - want to know some basic programming you
13:16 - will want to be familiar with
13:18 - development but you're also going to
13:19 - want to know some of the following so
13:21 - maybe Jenkins gitlab travisci GitHub
13:24 - actions all these things for doing
13:25 - continuous integration and continuous
13:27 - deployment you're going to want to know
13:28 - about ter terraform kubernetes uh cloud
13:31 - formations Docker you're also going to
13:33 - want to do monitoring and logging so
13:35 - maybe you're familiar with tools like
13:36 - Prometheus then you're also going to
13:38 - have to know about cloud service
13:39 - providers as well again Google Cloud AWS
13:42 - Azure Etc scripting this is a big one
13:45 - you're probably going to want to know a
13:46 - bit of python a bit of bash maybe
13:48 - something like Ruby depending on the
13:50 - scripting language that you'll need to
13:51 - use and then networking and security you
13:53 - probably want to have the fundamentals
13:55 - of that and understand how that works
13:57 - and then lastly of course you want to
13:58 - know about data as well like SQL and
14:00 - nosql databases so now before we go any
14:03 - further let me quickly cover a question
14:04 - many of you have probably had which is
14:06 - Tim what about all the other fields of
14:08 - development well yes you could go
14:09 - specialize in game development you can
14:11 - get really good at robotics or all these
14:14 - other fields that exist like augmented
14:15 - reality virtual reality Etc there is
14:18 - less positions in those fields and
14:20 - truthfully if you can get good in one of
14:22 - these different areas it's a lot easier
14:24 - to transition into something else if
14:26 - your goal is to land a job as a
14:28 - developer I do recommend sticking to one
14:30 - of these three fields at least in your
14:32 - early career and then you can more
14:34 - easily transition into all of these
14:36 - other fields where you do usually
14:37 - require a bit more experience if you're
14:39 - going to be a virtual reality developer
14:41 - for example typically you're going to
14:42 - need development experience in order to
14:45 - get that development experience it's
14:46 - easier in one of these three Fields some
14:49 - of you may disagree with me on that but
14:50 - that's typically my advice and that's
14:52 - why I'm just mentioning these three now
14:54 - with that in mind we also have full
14:56 - stack development well before you can
14:58 - become a good full stack developer you
14:59 - would need to either be a front end
15:00 - developer or a backend developer sure
15:03 - you can learn them at the same time but
15:04 - if you want to be really really good you
15:06 - would first specialize in one and then
15:08 - you would add all of those additional
15:10 - skills at least that's how I would
15:11 - recommend that you do it anyways with
15:14 - all that said let's quickly talk about
15:16 - how you actually pick which one you want
15:17 - to specialize in the truth here is that
15:20 - all that really matters is what
15:21 - interests you the most now if when I was
15:24 - talking about these one of these really
15:25 - resonated with you and you feel pretty
15:27 - confident that that's what you wanted do
15:29 - then go for it pick that as your
15:31 - specialization but if you're not sure
15:33 - which one you want to get into and this
15:34 - video gave you the information but
15:36 - you're still kind of in between which
15:37 - one you would like I'd recommend trying
15:40 - each of them I don't mean spending 3
15:42 - months on all of them I mean spending
15:43 - two or 3 days and building out a
15:45 - front-end project then building out a
15:47 - backend project then doing something
15:48 - with devops watch a few tutorials go
15:51 - online read more about all of the
15:53 - different fields and really try to
15:55 - understand which one is going to
15:56 - interest you the most and what you're
15:58 - going to be able to commit to for the
15:59 - long run the biggest mistake and what
16:01 - holds people back is that they get good
16:03 - in one field and then they decide that
16:05 - they really don't like it because it was
16:07 - the wrong one to start with and they go
16:09 - and they relearn for example backend or
16:11 - devops and start all the way from the
16:13 - beginning that's really going to hinder
16:14 - your career and keep making you take
16:16 - steps back so if you can make the
16:18 - correct decision now you can go all the
16:20 - way up the ladder and rather than
16:22 - switching between all these different
16:23 - fields you can really become a master of
16:25 - your craft now last thing to note here
16:27 - is that if you are interested in any of
16:29 - these three Fields I do have a software
16:31 - development course where you can
16:32 - actually pick a specialization in front
16:33 - end backend or devops after trying and
16:36 - working with all of the different topics
16:38 - you can check that out from the link in
16:39 - the description anyways I'm going to
16:41 - wrap it up like the video leave a
16:43 - comment and I will see you in the next
16:45 - one
