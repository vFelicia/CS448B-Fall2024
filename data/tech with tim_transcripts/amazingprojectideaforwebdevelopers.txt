00:00 - all right so now in terms of a bunch of
00:01 - different ideas for uh web applications
00:04 - obviously you can just punch in chat GPT
00:06 - give me ideas for web apps but I think
00:08 - some popular ones to do are like social
00:10 - media clones right now this is something
00:13 - that is done by a lot of people but it's
00:15 - pretty complicated not many people can
00:17 - actually make like a decent functioning
00:18 - social media clone so if you can do that
00:20 - that's going to show pretty deep
00:22 - knowledge and I'd say that's a worthy
00:24 - project to have on a resume like a
00:26 - Twitter clone an Instagram clone maybe
00:28 - even something like Snapchat maybe you
00:29 - could pick like a more Niche social
00:30 - media and that'd be a more unique
00:32 - project and just to clarify here you
00:34 - don't have to literally build Instagram
00:35 - or Twitter you build a small subset of
00:38 - those features to show that you
00:39 - understand how to interact with
00:40 - databases how to serve maybe live data
00:42 - maybe you're notifying users this would
00:45 - be a big project but again a good one
00:46 - for a resume
