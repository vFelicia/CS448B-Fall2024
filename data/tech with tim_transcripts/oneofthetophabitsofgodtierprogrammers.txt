00:00 - you should get in the habit as early as
00:02 - possible of writing clean and quality
00:04 - code no matter what you're coding now
00:06 - that's what I've noticed with these kind
00:08 - of god tier really experienced
00:09 - programmers they always have the same
00:11 - code quality because they're so used to
00:13 - writing high quality clean code that
00:15 - they do it no matter what it's like
00:17 - second nature so I think you need to ask
00:19 - yourself here do I always write the best
00:21 - quality code that I can am I sometimes
00:23 - rushed am I sometimes skipping out on
00:25 - variable names or functions and if you
00:27 - are you might just want to consider kind
00:29 - of the repercussions of doing that that
00:31 - you're not building that habit of
00:33 - consistently writing quality code once
00:35 - you get in the habit of just always
00:36 - doing that it doesn't become difficult
00:38 - anymore becomes simple you're just
00:39 - always writing code in a quality way
