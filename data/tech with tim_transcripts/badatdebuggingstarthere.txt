00:02 - to find errors if you do not know what
00:04 - the problem is so the first thing you
00:06 - should be doing every single time you're
00:08 - trying to fix or find a bug is isolate
00:11 - what the problem actually is and
00:13 - understand the problem deeply know how
00:15 - to replicate it know where it's
00:17 - occurring know what the actual issue is
00:19 - and try to grasp the scope of this
00:21 - problem you need to understand the
00:23 - problem before you can go and try to fix
00:25 - it and the way that you can do that is
00:27 - by kind of going through and just
00:28 - manually testing the application or
00:30 - ideally running automated tests that you
00:32 - would have built before that is Step
00:34 - number one isolate the problem
