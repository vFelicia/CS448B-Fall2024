00:02 - [Music]
00:06 - hello everybody and welcome to a brand
00:09 - new tutorial series on flutter now
00:11 - flutter is a framework made by Google
00:13 - that lets us build pretty much every
00:14 - kind of application that we want so we
00:16 - can build iOS apps we can build Android
00:18 - apps we can build web apps we can build
00:20 - desktop apps whatever you want you can
00:22 - probably build that with flutter and the
00:24 - great thing with flutter is the speed
00:26 - and how easy it is to take code that
00:28 - you've written say for iOS and translate
00:30 - that into an android application and in
00:33 - fact what we're gonna be focusing on
00:34 - here is actually building mobile apps so
00:37 - building Android apps and iOS apps and
00:39 - the great thing is that all of the code
00:41 - that I write is pretty much gonna be
00:42 - able to run on both an Android device
00:44 - and a Nyota vaio s device at the exact
00:46 - same time so they're gonna be no changes
00:48 - you really need to make you're just
00:50 - gonna be able to run whatever code you
00:51 - write here on both an Android device and
00:53 - an iOS device so you're pretty much
00:55 - making two applications with just one
00:57 - singular codebase so it's a huge
00:59 - advantage of flutter and there's no
01:01 - speed decrease in doing this because the
01:03 - language that flutter uses is called
01:05 - dart that can actually be compiled
01:06 - natively into android OS compatible code
01:09 - and iOS OS compatible code right so
01:13 - that's great that means this is a super
01:15 - fast application it's gonna run you know
01:17 - like any native app would run on Android
01:19 - or iOS there's no slowdowns because of a
01:21 - heavy framework around it there's a ton
01:23 - of other advantages of flutter and the
01:25 - language dart and you're gonna see how
01:27 - easy it is to actually build some pretty
01:29 - basic applications and that's what this
01:31 - tutorial series is gonna be focused on
01:33 - we're not going to be building any
01:34 - production level applications we're just
01:37 - gonna be learning a bit about this
01:38 - framework kind of getting our you know
01:39 - hands wet or feet wet whatever you want
01:41 - to call it with it and just getting
01:42 - comfortable with it so if we want to
01:44 - actually make some more complicated apps
01:45 - we can do that everything's set up on
01:47 - our system and we're ready to go so with
01:50 - that being said I'll talk quickly about
01:51 - this tutorial series this first video is
01:54 - really just gonna be getting everything
01:56 - set up so we're getting our development
01:58 - environment set up get all our plugins
01:59 - installed everything downloaded that we
02:01 - need to this process will unfortunately
02:03 - take a long time just because the set up
02:06 - is pretty difficult and pretty tedious
02:07 - but once we get through this it's pretty
02:09 - much smooth sailing and we're just gonna
02:11 - be writing code
02:12 - building applications so let's go ahead
02:14 - and get started so the first thing that
02:16 - we're gonna do and that I recommend you
02:18 - guys do is head over to the flutter
02:19 - website all of the links that I
02:21 - mentioned here will be in the
02:22 - description by the way so you can find
02:23 - them there and go ahead and click on
02:25 - this get started page and go through the
02:28 - installation guide for your specific
02:30 - operating system so of course I'm gonna
02:32 - summarize this whole installation guide
02:34 - but I just know things are a little bit
02:36 - different if you're on Mac or if you're
02:37 - on Linux because this is gonna be for
02:39 - Windows so you might just want to go
02:40 - here at least have this as a reference
02:42 - so that you can see what's happening say
02:44 - on the Mac OS side which might be a
02:46 - little bit different than it is on the
02:48 - windows side again once you get past
02:51 - kind of installing the flutter sdk
02:52 - things will start to kind of synchronize
02:54 - between the different operating systems
02:56 - but I just want to make sure you don't
02:57 - rely solely on this video because there
02:59 - will be some things that are gonna be
03:01 - different between the different
03:02 - operating systems like for example if
03:03 - you're on iOS you're probably gonna be
03:05 - using Xcode whereas if you're on Windows
03:07 - like me we are gonna be using Android
03:09 - studio and vs code anyways once you do
03:12 - that let's move forward the next thing
03:15 - we're gonna do is install git now you
03:17 - don't need get but for this video at
03:20 - least I'm gonna be using it just cuz it
03:21 - makes things a lot easier so go to this
03:23 - link in the description download kit for
03:25 - your operating system most of you
03:27 - probably have this and then just make
03:30 - sure that once you've downloaded that
03:31 - first of all you add this to your system
03:33 - path so that you can go into a command
03:35 - prompt window or a terminal window and
03:37 - type git if you type git and you get
03:39 - some kind of help command stuff popping
03:40 - up boom you're good to go you've
03:42 - installed it download it and yeah we're
03:44 - good to continue so once you've got get
03:47 - what we're actually gonna do is we're
03:49 - gonna go to the location that we want to
03:51 - install our get on or not Herget sorry
03:54 - are at flutter SDK on so essentially the
03:56 - first step is to download the flutter
03:58 - SDK and add that to our system path so
04:01 - that we can use the flutter command from
04:03 - our terminal so what we're gonna do is
04:05 - pick some location that does not have I
04:07 - think it's heightened privileges so
04:09 - that's not like an administrator folder
04:11 - or something so don't put it in your
04:12 - Program Files don't put it you know
04:15 - system32 don't put it anywhere like that
04:17 - find some place like in your Documents
04:20 - folder or in your downloads or on your
04:22 - desktop or wherever you think you're not
04:23 - going to lose
04:24 - it's fine to be there that does not have
04:26 - elevated privileges and install this in
04:28 - so I'm gonna go to my SSD number one I
04:30 - just have a bunch of drives so I'm gonna
04:32 - make a folder on here you can see I
04:33 - actually already have flutter and that's
04:35 - where I'm going to install it so what
04:37 - I'm gonna do is I'm gonna open up a
04:38 - command prompt window in this location
04:40 - so to do that I just went up to this top
04:42 - bar and type CMD that opens the command
04:45 - prompt and you can see the location is
04:47 - on these set drive so just get your
04:50 - command prompt so that this location of
04:52 - the left hand side here is where you
04:53 - actually want to install this if you're
04:56 - on Mac I think you can right click and
04:57 - click open and terminal or something
04:59 - from the finder and that should open up
05:01 - if you're on Linux I'm gonna hope that
05:02 - you know how to navigate the command
05:04 - prompt so once you have that we're gonna
05:06 - use git to actually clone the flood or
05:08 - SDK right into this folder so we don't
05:11 - have to do any extracting or downloading
05:12 - ourself or anything like that so I'm
05:14 - just gonna copy this command I'll put it
05:16 - up on the screen and leave it in the
05:17 - description but this is what you want to
05:19 - do you want to type git clone and then
05:22 - HTTP colon slash slash github comm slash
05:26 - flutter slash flutter duck get - be
05:29 - space stable so you can find this from
05:32 - the flutter website as well but again
05:34 - this will be in the description
05:35 - hopefully you can see it on the screen
05:37 - right here and once you've done that
05:39 - assuming you don't have a folder called
05:40 - flutter already in this location it
05:42 - should start downloading all the files
05:44 - and the flutter ste case should be
05:46 - downloaded right here now once you've
05:49 - done that we're going to go into the
05:51 - flood or sdk so open up this folder and
05:53 - we're going to need to go to the bin
05:54 - folder and the reason we're doing this
05:56 - is because we need to copy the path to
05:58 - this bin folder so we just need to find
06:01 - where this bin folder is and copy the
06:03 - path so in my case I'm on the Z Drive
06:06 - I'm in the flutter folder and I'm in bin
06:08 - so let's copy that right here let's say
06:11 - you're on your C Drive you're in your
06:12 - users folder or something like that you
06:15 - know you'd be C Drive users slash
06:16 - flutter or slash bin just copy that path
06:19 - make sure you have that path I think if
06:21 - you can't find it up here you can
06:23 - right-click on the folder go to
06:25 - properties and you should be able to
06:26 - find the path right here it shows the
06:28 - location so once you have that what we
06:31 - need to do at least on Windows is we
06:32 - need to add this to our system path or
06:34 - our environment variables so if you type
06:36 - env or in
06:38 - you should see the edit edit the system
06:40 - environment variables pan popping up
06:42 - again this is Windows specific if you're
06:44 - on Mac you're gonna have to follow along
06:46 - with this guide here from the flutter
06:48 - Doc's that shows you how to modify your
06:50 - path so anyways I open to my environment
06:52 - variables it's right here I'm gonna
06:54 - select sorry from the Advanced tab
06:56 - environment variables and you're gonna
06:58 - see this thing pop up on my screen that
07:00 - it just has all of these different
07:03 - variables in it so you can see we have
07:05 - like chocolate ego path onedrive all
07:07 - this other stuff we're gonna look for
07:08 - this one that says path here and we're
07:11 - just gonna click on it and click Edit
07:12 - now this is what we want to modify to
07:15 - add our flutter SDK to the paths that we
07:18 - can use these flutter commands from our
07:19 - command prompt so you can see I already
07:21 - have mine added to the path here at the
07:23 - very bottom but what you need to do if
07:25 - you want to add a new entry into this
07:26 - path is just go somewhere near the
07:28 - bottom of it hit new and should bring up
07:31 - a new line you're gonna paste the path
07:33 - that you had to that flutters being a
07:36 - folder so you can see I have flutter
07:37 - /bin you're gonna press enter like that
07:40 - and you're gonna press ok now I've got
07:43 - mine in there twice that's totally fine
07:44 - it's not gonna make a difference you get
07:47 - the point you should be able to
07:48 - hopefully just add that in so actually
07:49 - let me delete this one just cuz I don't
07:51 - want to have it duplicated but once you
07:53 - have this inside the path okay okay you
07:56 - should be able to click apply here or
07:58 - okay or something like that that should
08:00 - save all the settings and now if you
08:02 - restart your command prompt window so
08:04 - let me just actually get rid of both
08:06 - these for a second if you restart it you
08:09 - should be able to type flutter like that
08:12 - now if you can type flutter and you see
08:14 - something popping up you have achieved
08:16 - that step you've accomplished that one
08:18 - so we are good to continue on so the
08:21 - next thing we're gonna do is actually
08:22 - from our command prompt we're gonna type
08:24 - flutter dr. like this now what this does
08:27 - is scan your system and analyze if you
08:30 - have the right dependencies for flutter
08:32 - if you don't it will automatically
08:34 - install them for you with the exception
08:36 - of a few different things so what we're
08:37 - gonna do is type flutter doctor press
08:39 - enter and at any point throughout the
08:41 - rest of the video if you think that
08:43 - something has gone wrong if you don't
08:44 - have the right dependencies go ahead and
08:46 - run flutter doctor hit enter and it will
08:49 - tell you what you're missing or what you
08:50 - need to install
08:51 - so we can see here that's saying flutter
08:54 - channels stable you know good we have
08:57 - that installed it says Android tool
08:58 - chain developed for Android devices some
09:01 - Android license is not accepted to
09:02 - resolve this run flutter dr. Android
09:05 - licenses so we're gonna do that because
09:08 - well we need to do this so it's gonna
09:09 - work for Android devices so I'm gonna
09:11 - copy that and actually I don't think I
09:14 - can paste that and I'm gonna go flutter
09:15 - dr. and then - - Android if we spell
09:20 - that right - licenses is that how you
09:24 - spell licenses I think it is and let's
09:26 - see if this will fix the licensing issue
09:28 - for us so I think we have to review all
09:30 - of these so I'm just gonna hit Y on all
09:32 - of them and all SDK packages licenses
09:35 - are accepted so now we're good to go so
09:37 - let me run flutter doctor one more time
09:39 - and let's see what it's saying now and
09:41 - see if that fixed that and that seems to
09:43 - be good so now it just says Android
09:45 - studio flutter plug-in not installed
09:47 - dart plug-in not installed that's fine
09:49 - we're not going to be using Android
09:50 - studio for development so we don't need
09:52 - that
09:52 - it's as vyas code that one looks good
09:54 - and no devices are connected all right
09:57 - so now flutter doctor is good hopefully
09:59 - you guys have run that and all the
10:01 - dependencies have been installed and the
10:03 - next thing we're going to do is actually
10:04 - go and install Android studio now we
10:07 - need Android studio because we have to
10:09 - be able to run in Android SDK or have an
10:11 - SDK and actually run on an Android
10:13 - emulator so that we don't have to plug
10:15 - in a physical device when we want to
10:17 - actually test our application now you
10:19 - can actually plug in say like a phone
10:21 - you know an iPhone Android whatever it
10:24 - is and you can run off of that device I
10:27 - find that sometimes that's a little
10:29 - glitchy and I just don't want to be
10:30 - messing around with my physical device
10:32 - in development so I'd rather just run
10:34 - this on an emulator and of course for
10:36 - the purpose of the video it's gonna be a
10:37 - lot easier if I just have it on the
10:39 - actual screen so we need Android studio
10:41 - if you want to actually run an emulator
10:43 - and I think you need it regardless so
10:46 - just go ahead and download Android
10:47 - studio so again link in the description
10:49 - when you download Android studio make
10:51 - sure you install the Android SDK I think
10:54 - that will come with it by default but
10:56 - that's pretty much the only thing you're
10:57 - gonna need and I'll talk about some more
10:59 - specifics within Android studio once
11:01 - you've done so once you've downloaded
11:03 - Android studio you're gonna go
11:05 - hadn't booted up and what we're gonna do
11:06 - here is we're gonna build our actual
11:08 - first emulator there's a few settings in
11:11 - here I need to go through to make sure
11:12 - this is all set up specifically for
11:13 - flutter if you're on an Intel CPU you
11:16 - are lucky because everything is probably
11:18 - just gonna work for you right out of the
11:20 - box you're not really going to need to
11:21 - change anything or make any
11:22 - modifications if you're using an AMD CPU
11:25 - in your system you can find that out I
11:27 - think by either looking at your physical
11:30 - system they will probably say Intel or
11:32 - AMD like there might be a sticker or
11:33 - something like that if you're on a
11:34 - laptop or I think you can go into like
11:36 - device manager something like that and
11:39 - look at what your CPU is regardless
11:41 - figure out if you're on Intel or AMD and
11:43 - if you're on AMD you're gonna need to
11:46 - follow the following steps and actually
11:48 - on Intel you might need to do this too
11:50 - so just follow along we're gonna go to
11:51 - Android studio once this is boot up
11:53 - we're gonna go to tools we're gonna go
11:55 - to SDK manager right here and then what
11:58 - we're gonna do is we're gonna look at
11:59 - the Android SDK and we're first gonna
12:01 - make sure that we have one of the more
12:03 - recent versions installed don't worry if
12:05 - you have an older SDK installed that's
12:06 - fine so long as it's not super old but
12:08 - make sure you have one of those
12:09 - installed here if you don't use this
12:12 - tool to select where you want to install
12:13 - it and install it we're gonna need the
12:15 - SDK to be able to go along with this
12:17 - next we're going to go to SDK tools so
12:20 - here you can see the tools that I have
12:22 - checked and compare that to the tools
12:25 - that you have checked so right now I
12:27 - have the Android SDK command line tool
12:29 - we're gonna need that one for sure so
12:31 - give that a check mark so check like
12:34 - that we are gonna need the Android
12:36 - emulator so make sure that is checked
12:38 - we need the build tools from Android SDK
12:40 - which you should already have and now
12:42 - this is the specific step for AMD if
12:45 - you're on AMD you need to check this box
12:47 - right here for the Android emulator
12:49 - hypervisor driver for AMD processors you
12:53 - also need to make sure you have the
12:54 - Android SDK platform tools I'm pretty
12:57 - sure we're gonna be using that one and
12:59 - if you're on Intel so you have an Intel
13:01 - CPU look down here it says Intel x86
13:04 - emulator accelerator you're gonna want
13:06 - to install that that's gonna make your
13:08 - emulator probably about 10 times faster
13:10 - than it would be without that so once
13:12 - you have these things checked
13:13 - appropriately you're gonna go ahead and
13:15 - hit apply it's probably gonna run you
13:16 - through a big installation process and
13:19 - to install all these different tools so
13:21 - go through that make sure everything
13:22 - installs properly and then we'll be off
13:24 - to the next step now quick note here if
13:27 - you are on actually any computer what
13:30 - you're gonna need to do with any of
13:31 - these steps a break is gonna need to
13:33 - actually enable virtualization now
13:35 - virtualization is a feature of your CPU
13:38 - you can actually enable that from your
13:40 - computer's BIOS which is something that
13:41 - I actually can't show you unless I film
13:43 - say with my smart phone because I can't
13:45 - screen record the BIOS but what you need
13:47 - to do is go into the BIOS you need to
13:49 - find whatever by us it is you have to
13:51 - look up how you enable virtualization
13:53 - for your CPU and you're gonna need to do
13:55 - that now most of you should actually
13:57 - already have that enabled but if for
13:59 - some reason you don't have that enabled
14:01 - go into your BIOS you do that usually by
14:03 - spamming f2 F 11 or F 10 when you're
14:07 - actually booting up into the system so
14:09 - before you hit the windows load screen
14:11 - to bring you into some crazy-looking
14:13 - hackish environment and you need to go I
14:16 - believe at least for my BIOS it was in
14:18 - the overclock settings it was in the CPU
14:20 - features and then I enabled
14:21 - virtualization so you need that
14:23 - otherwise this will not work again that
14:25 - will require a restart of your computer
14:27 - to be able to do that
14:28 - so hopefully you do that once you have
14:30 - you know make sure all this stuff is
14:32 - installed and then what we're gonna do
14:34 - is actually create our first Android
14:36 - emulator and then we'll be somewhat
14:38 - close to the finish line here so the
14:40 - next thing we're gonna do is we're gonna
14:41 - go to where it says devices so in this
14:43 - little car over here let me see if I can
14:46 - zoom in at all it doesn't look like they
14:49 - have the control + work in here but
14:50 - anyways we're gonna go to open a video
14:52 - and now we are going to actually work on
14:56 - picking our device and creating a device
14:58 - so you can see I have two devices here I
15:00 - have one running API 25 we run one
15:03 - running API 30 but I'm gonna create a
15:06 - new one for this tutorial and what I'm
15:08 - gonna do is go to phone and I'm gonna
15:10 - select whatever device I want to use to
15:12 - actually run my app on so you guys can
15:14 - pick whatever you want pick a phone
15:16 - please
15:17 - for a mobile app but pick any phone you
15:19 - want I usually like to just go with the
15:21 - pixel three but again pick any device
15:23 - doesn't really matter I used I just like
15:26 - picking something that kind of has and
15:27 - in between screen size or screen size
15:30 - similar to the phone that I use so that
15:31 - I actually
15:32 - kind of the layout and how big this is
15:34 - relatively so what I'm gonna do is go
15:36 - pixel three I'm gonna press next and now
15:39 - I'm going to choose whatever API
15:42 - actually want to use on this device now
15:43 - if you're on an Intel machine you're
15:46 - lucky you can pick whatever you want and
15:48 - I highly recommend that you pick in x86
15:51 - API here so usually you just go with the
15:54 - most recent one in this case you can see
15:55 - are so I clicked download on our I've
15:57 - already done that on otherwise we would
15:59 - show me this download button that's
16:01 - gonna take a minute or two then you
16:02 - select this one and press next now let's
16:05 - say if you select one of these devices
16:07 - and you get a little warning on the
16:08 - right-hand side here that says hey you
16:10 - know your your computer's not capable of
16:12 - running this emulator blah blah whatever
16:14 - go to other images and then what you can
16:17 - do is select one of these AR m EA B
16:20 - versions here so if you for some reason
16:22 - cannot work on an x86 ABI or API or
16:27 - whatever you want to call it go over
16:28 - here to other images and download the
16:30 - most recent one that it says is
16:32 - acceptable for your system you're gonna
16:33 - pick one is AR m e ABB and then whatever
16:37 - version number here seven is fine eight
16:40 - is fine just don't pick these air M ones
16:42 - like that you gotta pick one that's air
16:45 - M EA B e a bi sorry that is a mouthful
16:49 - so anyways I'm gonna go on this x86
16:52 - release here I'm gonna press Next and
16:53 - then I'm just gonna name the device
16:55 - whatever I want you can name this
16:57 - flutter device or flutter emulator
16:59 - something that maybe that's good and
17:00 - press finish now since I actually don't
17:03 - want to make another device because I
17:04 - already have one made I'm just gonna
17:06 - press cancel there you guys would have
17:07 - pressed finish and now we have a device
17:09 - that we hopefully will be able to use so
17:12 - there we go
17:12 - and that should be all good and now
17:15 - we're gonna be off to the next step
17:16 - which is not involve Android studio so
17:19 - what you're gonna realize here is that
17:21 - Android studio is really just being used
17:23 - for the emulator and for the Android SDK
17:25 - we're not gonna use it for development
17:27 - although we could use it for development
17:29 - I just prefer to use vs code so that's
17:31 - the one I'm going to use for this
17:32 - tutorial and I think it's just a little
17:34 - bit better and in my opinion I also do
17:36 - work for Microsoft on the vs code team
17:38 - so take that into account when you're
17:40 - considering my bias but anyways I'm
17:42 - going to leave a link to download vs
17:43 - code in the description I assume most of
17:45 - you
17:45 - we already have that once you download
17:47 - it install vs code there's no tricks
17:49 - there you should be able to just install
17:51 - it fine then what were you gonna do is
17:53 - you're gonna open up vs code you can see
17:54 - I actually already have a excuse me here
17:57 - flutter application open so I'm just
17:59 - gonna open a new window so we start
18:01 - fresh here and I'm going to show you how
18:03 - we can actually setup flutter so we can
18:04 - start developing in vs code so we're
18:06 - almost in the homestretch here we're
18:08 - almost done don't worry what we're gonna
18:09 - do to start is we're actually going to
18:11 - go to the extensions tab which is this
18:14 - one right here so these four little
18:15 - cubes you should see this in your vs
18:17 - code window and we're going to go search
18:20 - extensions marketplace and we're going
18:22 - to search for the flutter extension so
18:26 - you can see the flower extension pops up
18:28 - it's made by dart code we're going to go
18:31 - ahead and click install I already have
18:34 - this installed but it will ask you to
18:36 - install there might be some pop-ups in
18:37 - the bottom right-hand corner of your
18:39 - screen that you need to accept and then
18:41 - you should be good
18:42 - now the next one we're gonna do is dart
18:44 - so we're going to install this dart
18:45 - plugin I believe that or dart extension
18:49 - whatever you want to call it
18:50 - I believe installing the flutter
18:51 - extension automatically installs the
18:53 - dart extension I could be wrong but just
18:55 - make sure you have both dart and flutter
18:56 - again you can find that by just
18:58 - searching you know dart like that and
19:01 - flutter in the marketplace once you have
19:05 - that there's no restart required all
19:06 - we're gonna do is actually set up our
19:09 - flutter environment and make our first
19:10 - flutter project so I'm gonna go and hit
19:13 - control shift key on my keyboard what
19:16 - this does is that opens the what do you
19:19 - call it - command prompt or terminal or
19:21 - whatever this thing is that you want to
19:23 - call it command manager I don't know the
19:25 - exact name that they go by but anyways
19:27 - that is control shift P that's gonna
19:29 - open this up command palette sorry I
19:31 - think that's what it's called
19:32 - and what we're gonna do is we're going
19:33 - to type flutter like this we're gonna go
19:35 - flutter new project so we're gonna click
19:38 - flutter new project this is gonna ask us
19:40 - what the name of our project should be
19:41 - we are actually going to just go with
19:43 - hello world for right now I'm gonna hit
19:46 - enter and you can see flutter tutorial I
19:48 - already got one named hello world let's
19:51 - just go ahead and put tutorial inside of
19:53 - here so I'm changing the name of it
19:54 - actually
19:55 - I'm gonna go select a folder to create
19:57 - the project in
19:58 - let's see let's let's make a new folder
20:01 - so new folder
20:02 - let's go tutorial like that and let's go
20:06 - inside of this folder and save our
20:08 - flutter project so there we go we can
20:10 - see flutter is now being created so it's
20:12 - creating a new project for us we could
20:14 - do this manually from the command line
20:16 - but since BS code has this nice
20:17 - extension we're just gonna use it and
20:19 - there we go our flutter app is actually
20:22 - up and running now I'm gonna show you
20:24 - how we can get this running on the
20:25 - emulator in just one second
20:27 - but hopefully all of this is working for
20:29 - you this code was generated and now you
20:31 - actually have some you know hello world
20:33 - application or whatever you decide to
20:35 - name it on your system with dart code
20:37 - inside of it so the next thing we're
20:39 - going to do is we're gonna hit ctrl
20:40 - shift B again we're gonna go to the
20:41 - command pallet and what we're gonna do
20:43 - is we're gonna say flutter like this and
20:46 - we're just gonna have a look at some of
20:47 - the commands that we have here so we
20:48 - have launched emulator run flutter dr.
20:51 - change SDK clean project and a bunch of
20:53 - other stuff so if there's anything you
20:55 - need to do from flutter you can use the
20:57 - vs code extension again that's control
20:59 - shift P command shift P I believe if you
21:02 - are on a Mac that will open up the
21:03 - command palette and you can have a look
21:05 - and run these different commands now
21:07 - what we're actually gonna do those pick
21:08 - the device that we want to run this
21:10 - flutter app on so if you have a device
21:13 - plugged into your computer you might
21:15 - actually be able to select it right now
21:16 - what we're gonna do is go to vs code go
21:19 - to the bottom right hand corner here
21:20 - where it says no device and we're going
21:22 - to select the emulator that we created
21:24 - in Android studio as our device now
21:27 - again if you have your Android device
21:29 - plugged in here I believe it only works
21:31 - for Android a physical device if you're
21:33 - on Windows then you should be able to
21:35 - select that device but I'm gonna select
21:37 - start pixel 3 API 30 mobile emulator so
21:41 - I'm gonna run that we're gonna give this
21:43 - a second and hopefully it's going to
21:45 - boot up the emulator for us and we're
21:47 - gonna give it a second to actually start
21:49 - connect and then hopefully run our
21:50 - sample application so there we go the
21:53 - emulator is up looks as though it's
21:56 - working ok and if you got to this stage
21:59 - you have pretty much set up your flutter
22:00 - environment correctly and we're gonna be
22:02 - ready for development
22:03 - now if something's gone wrong here it
22:05 - says you know cannot connect to device
22:07 - cannot find device first make sure that
22:09 - you have those CPU instructions that I
22:11 - talked
22:12 - about make sure you followed this you
22:13 - have virtualization enabled from your
22:15 - BIOS you're gonna need to do that on
22:17 - your computer if you don't already you
22:19 - have that little tick mark on the AMD
22:21 - hypervisor thing that I told you to do
22:23 - if you're on AMD processor and you have
22:25 - the Intel I believe it's ham X or
22:28 - something like that whatever that
22:30 - checkbox was for Intel installed so once
22:33 - you have all that that should work you
22:34 - should build around the emulator if you
22:36 - have a physical device again you can
22:37 - plug that in you should be able to
22:39 - select that from down here so I'm just
22:41 - gonna turn this on by hitting the power
22:42 - button once you can see that's bringing
22:44 - me to where I left off I was running a
22:46 - flutter app on this previously but let's
22:49 - now see if we can actually get our app
22:50 - to run on this device so from within
22:53 - vias code what we're gonna do is run
22:55 - this app to do that you can simply press
22:57 - f5 on your keyboard or you can go to the
23:00 - run tab here so it's little bug with a
23:02 - run icon and you should be able to
23:03 - actually run the app so now you can see
23:06 - that let's actually refresh this here
23:09 - for a second and see if it pops up on
23:11 - the Android emulator alright so I press
23:13 - run I just closed the old app because
23:16 - that was just an old instance that was
23:17 - running on my machine once you press run
23:19 - you should be able to look in the debug
23:20 - console here and see that some stuff is
23:22 - starting to happen now on the initial
23:24 - run this will take a second to actually
23:26 - boot up it needs to take all the code
23:27 - and compile it and actually put it on to
23:30 - the correct device so you can see here
23:32 - it's saying dart dev tools includes
23:33 - additional tools for debugging and
23:35 - profiling flutter ops including a widget
23:37 - inspector try it I'm gonna go ahead and
23:39 - try that so i'm gonna click open and see
23:41 - that's gonna bring me into my browser
23:43 - here into this detailed debug
23:45 - environment so i can actually have a
23:47 - look at everything that's going on in my
23:49 - application now we're not gonna talk
23:51 - more about this later we're not really
23:52 - gonna be using it a ton because we're
23:54 - not doing any crazy development right
23:56 - now but this is a really nice way to
23:58 - actually be able to figure out what's
23:59 - going on in your app look at all of the
24:02 - widgets look at all the dependencies
24:03 - everything that's happening do a refresh
24:06 - select specific widgets all that fun
24:08 - stuff and one of the reasons why dart is
24:10 - just a great development thing to use
24:11 - alright so you can see that now on my
24:14 - device this is actually running this is
24:16 - the demo app from flutter you should
24:18 - have the exact same one what you can do
24:20 - is you can press this button and you can
24:23 - see that some border around our app is
24:25 - changing random colors and we have the
24:28 - count of how many times we press this
24:29 - button now I believe we're getting that
24:31 - border because we're in this debugger
24:33 - tool here but regardless that is all I
24:36 - wanted to do in this video is get us set
24:38 - up and running and show you how we can
24:40 - actually get flooded working on our
24:42 - machine now an interesting thing with
24:44 - flutter is that you can actually do
24:45 - something called a hot refresh so rather
24:47 - than having to rebuild the app every
24:50 - single time you make a change you can
24:51 - press this a lightning button here this
24:53 - is a hot reload what that will do is
24:55 - just take whatever code you've changed
24:57 - and apply that so make the change on the
24:59 - device in live time so you don't need to
25:02 - rebuild every single time you want to
25:03 - test something you just press that
25:05 - little lightning button and immediately
25:07 - it will make the change on the device
25:08 - and I think it does not change state
25:11 - when you do that I could be wrong on
25:13 - that we're going to talk more about this
25:15 - in later videos but I just want to show
25:17 - you that there is this hot reload thing
25:18 - which is a really cool development
25:20 - feature so yeah alright so with that
25:23 - being said it asmin it for the first
25:24 - video in the next videos we're gonna dig
25:26 - into this code Graham talk about more
25:28 - about flutter we're gonna build some
25:29 - more applications and all of that with
25:32 - that being said if you enjoyed make sure
25:33 - you leave a like subscribe to the
25:35 - channel and of course I will see you
25:36 - guys in the next flutter tutorial
