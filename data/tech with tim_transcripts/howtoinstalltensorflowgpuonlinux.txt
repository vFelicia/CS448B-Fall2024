00:00 - hey guys so in today's video I'm gonna
00:02 - be showing you how to install tensorflow
00:03 - 2.0 GPU version on Anna bunt 2 / Linux
00:07 - machine now this should work for any
00:09 - version of Linux or any Linux operating
00:11 - system although the one I am gonna be
00:13 - showing you on is a bun to 18 point 0.4
00:16 - now you may notice that I'm actually on
00:18 - a Windows machine right now and that
00:19 - this is actually just in a bunch of
00:21 - terminal that's open now I'm actually
00:23 - just SS aged into a server that I have
00:25 - that contains 2 1080 graphics card so
00:28 - GTX 1080s and that's how I'm gonna be
00:30 - showing you how to do this now quickly
00:32 - if you don't understand the difference
00:33 - between the CPU and the GPU version the
00:36 - CPU version is essentially just way
00:37 - slower and you would only really use the
00:40 - CPU version if you don't have a graphics
00:42 - card in your computer that is capable of
00:44 - running tensorflow 2.0 GPU so quickly
00:47 - before we go forward and you guys get
00:49 - frustrated with not being able to
00:50 - install this make sure that you have a
00:52 - graphics card that actually works for
00:53 - this programmer for this module that
00:56 - means you have to have a graphics card
00:58 - that is a gtx 1050 TI or higher those
01:01 - are the ones that are listed on
01:03 - tensorflow website as compatible with
01:06 - tensorflow 2.0 GPU if you want to have a
01:08 - quick thing without having to go to the
01:10 - website to see if yours works even as 4
01:12 - gigs of video RAM and is a GTX
01:15 - generation card or higher it most likely
01:17 - works with tensorflow 2.0 now I don't
01:20 - know about all the different cards but
01:21 - you have any questions leave them below
01:22 - I'll try to answer that for you but any
01:24 - 1060 1070 1080 or r-tx cards they have
01:28 - CUDA cores on them will work for this
01:31 - essentially you just need a CUDA enable
01:32 - GPU so you can check if yours meets that
01:35 - requirement before moving forward
01:36 - now to do this I'm just gonna be
01:38 - following the steps listed on the
01:40 - tensorflow website now you may run into
01:42 - some issues while doing this but for
01:45 - Ubuntu this is pretty straightforward
01:46 - and I'm essentially just gonna be
01:47 - copying these commands and pasting them
01:49 - in my terminal now if you'd like to just
01:51 - try to do this without following along
01:52 - with video go ahead but I will be kind
01:54 - of showing you some fixes that I ran
01:56 - into while I was doing this um so let's
01:59 - go ahead and get started so actually let
02:01 - me just split the screen up so we can
02:02 - have a look at both them at once I'm in
02:04 - my Linux machine right now you just have
02:06 - to get to the terminal you notice that I
02:08 - don't even have a desktop and I'm
02:09 - literally just gonna start copying and
02:10 - pasting these commands now the first
02:12 - thing that we need
02:13 - to install is actually CUDA now CUDA is
02:17 - what allows us to use the CUDA cores on
02:20 - our GPU to actually run the code so just
02:23 - go ahead and keep copying these commands
02:25 - it will take a second and I actually
02:27 - already have this installed on my
02:29 - machine so I'm gonna go through the
02:30 - steps with you guys but again if
02:32 - anything is different on my machine
02:33 - that's probably because it's already
02:34 - installed so if you don't know how to
02:36 - copy it into a window like this you just
02:39 - right click on your mouse and it'll copy
02:41 - if you're using a server like I am but
02:43 - anyways we'll just go through all of
02:45 - these and keep going now I will have all
02:48 - these commands listed in my description
02:50 - as well and that should show you guys
02:53 - you know if the website goes down at any
02:55 - point you can just copy it from there as
02:56 - well so yeah it literally just keep
02:58 - going all we're doing here is adding the
02:59 - video packages we're gonna make sure we
03:01 - have the Nvidia drivers for our graphics
03:04 - card that are correct and then we're
03:06 - gonna go ahead and install tensorflow
03:07 - 2.0 so yep just go through these
03:10 - commands there's not really much for me
03:11 - to say as I copy these in and eventually
03:14 - we will get through them all alright so
03:18 - now we're gonna install the even a video
03:20 - driver you can see that's all commented
03:21 - out on this tensorflow website here copy
03:24 - that and I can just continue go I don't
03:29 - really have any commentary for you guys
03:30 - here so we'll copy this this is gonna
03:33 - install obviously the development and
03:35 - runtime libraries which we need and it
03:37 - says minimum four gigs or approximately
03:39 - four gigabytes which will mean that's
03:40 - how long it how many gigabytes is
03:41 - getting take up on a machine so this
03:43 - will take a second and I'll fast-forward
03:45 - through these stuff if it does take a
03:46 - while finally we're going to install
03:48 - tensor RT I don't even know what this is
03:50 - but apparently it's required and then
03:52 - after we're done this we should actually
03:53 - be finished installing everything that
03:56 - we need for tensorflow 2.0 to work again
03:58 - if you guys want to go through this just
04:00 - go to the website copy all these
04:01 - commands in order paste them into here
04:04 - and they should work properly now
04:06 - finally what we have to do is actually
04:08 - install tensorflow 2.0 so we've got all
04:10 - the dependents the dependencies
04:12 - installed and now to install tensorflow
04:14 - 2.0 we're just gonna say pip 3 install
04:17 - tensorflow
04:18 - and i believe we're gonna say - GPU and
04:22 - then equals equals 2.0 point
04:24 - I gotta find it up here too
04:27 - make sure that we do it correctly
04:28 - two-point 0.0 - alpha zero like that so
04:33 - then we'll do that
04:34 - and that should install tents flow 2.0
04:37 - for us now I already have this installed
04:38 - but this will actually take a few
04:40 - minutes to install because there is
04:41 - quite a bit of stuff that it needs to
04:43 - download on your computer so anyways
04:45 - that has been it for installing
04:46 - tensorflow 2.0 on your computer using
04:49 - the GPU version again throughout the
04:50 - rest of the neural network series I'm
04:52 - gonna be going forward doing this on in
04:54 - a bunting machine so running all of the
04:55 - code I'll do the development and windows
04:57 - throw the files on my server train the
05:00 - model train the models excuse me and
05:02 - then take the models off and use them on
05:04 - my Windows machine so if you want to
05:06 - validate if this is working you can
05:08 - really quickly just do Python 3 in Linux
05:10 - and then you can cite do import
05:13 - tensorflow
05:14 - and doing that you shouldn't get any
05:16 - errors and if you don't get any errors
05:18 - then you have successfully installed
05:19 - tensorflow 2.0 now a few errors here
05:22 - because they're still listening and
05:23 - stuff wasn't working if for some reason
05:25 - when you install tensorflow and you
05:26 - notice that it's not using your GPU go
05:29 - ahead and uninstall the cpu version of
05:31 - tensorflow so just pip3 on on the
05:34 - install and then tensorflow
05:37 - and i guess you'd have to just do just
05:40 - tensorflow like that and that will
05:41 - install the cpu version if it is
05:43 - installed in your machine so anyways
05:45 - that has been it for how to install
05:46 - tensorflow
05:47 - 2.0 GPU version on a bun - pretty
05:49 - straightforward just go through copies
05:50 - commands if you guys have any questions
05:52 - or errors please just leave them in the
05:53 - comments below and i will try my best to
05:55 - help you up
