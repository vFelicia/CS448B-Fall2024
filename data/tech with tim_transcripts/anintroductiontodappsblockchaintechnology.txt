00:00 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:01 - youtube video so in today's video i'm
00:04 - going to be talking about blockchain
00:06 - technology and d apps otherwise known as
00:08 - decentralized applications now i want
00:10 - this video to act as a high level
00:12 - introduction to decentralized
00:14 - applications and how you can use
00:16 - blockchain technology to actually create
00:18 - apps now the reason i'm making this is
00:20 - because recently there's been a lot of
00:21 - hype around cryptocurrency but a lot of
00:24 - people look at cryptocurrency and
00:25 - blockchain in general and think that's
00:27 - only a way to make money they treat it
00:29 - simply as an investment and something
00:31 - that they can trade almost like a stock
00:33 - however there's a completely different
00:34 - side of cryptocurrency which is the
00:36 - development side well that's what this
00:38 - video is going to focus on so in this
00:40 - video i'm going to talk to you about
00:41 - what a blockchain is what
00:43 - decentralization is what a d app is and
00:46 - then the pros and cons of a d-app and
00:48 - some of the different solutions that
00:50 - companies are implementing to create
00:52 - d-apps however before we go any further
00:54 - i do need to mention that i myself am
00:56 - not a cryptocurrency or blockchain
00:58 - expert and that's why for this video i
01:00 - teamed up with a company called cartesi
01:02 - which helped me shape a lot of the
01:03 - content in this video now cartesia is a
01:06 - company that's dedicated to making the
01:08 - blockchain and cryptocurrency more
01:10 - accessible to developers like you and i
01:12 - they have a ton of different products
01:14 - and solutions that allow the blockchain
01:16 - to be more affordable to use easier to
01:18 - use and they just provide a bunch of
01:19 - tutorials resources and really cool
01:22 - products and you can check them out from
01:23 - the link in the description now they
01:25 - also are the sponsor of this video i'll
01:27 - likely be working with them in the
01:28 - future to create in-depth tutorials on
01:30 - how to actually make decentralized
01:32 - applications but as i said in this video
01:34 - it's just going to be a high level
01:35 - overview on how d apps work so let's go
01:38 - ahead and get started
01:42 - [Music]
01:48 - so before we get into decentralized
01:50 - applications the first thing you need to
01:51 - understand is what a blockchain is so
01:53 - i'll give you a simple definition here a
01:56 - blockchain is a system of storing
01:58 - information that makes it extremely
02:00 - difficult or impossible to hack cheat or
02:03 - change so generally speaking we can
02:05 - trust this system and we know everything
02:07 - on a blockchain is true accurate and
02:10 - complete information and it's not been
02:12 - hacked or kind of modified maliciously
02:14 - in any way now going a bit further
02:16 - blockchains are used in cryptocurrencies
02:18 - like ethereum bitcoin and many other
02:20 - cryptocurrencies that you would know and
02:22 - the way they work is they're a digital
02:24 - ledger of all of the transactions that
02:26 - have occurred in this cryptocurrency's
02:28 - history now this ledger is distributed
02:31 - to all of the different computers that
02:33 - are sitting on the blockchain network so
02:35 - you may have heard of the term miners
02:36 - before these are really computers that
02:38 - are sitting on the blockchain and they
02:40 - store a copy of this digital ledger so
02:43 - every single computer that's on for
02:44 - example the ethereum network has a copy
02:47 - of the ethereum blockchain and this
02:49 - makes it very very hard for someone to
02:51 - actually maliciously change or send a
02:53 - malicious transaction on the blockchain
02:56 - now the way that works is if someone
02:58 - wanted to actually send something
02:59 - through on the blockchain that was
03:00 - inaccurate was false was some malicious
03:03 - type of transaction or they wanted to
03:04 - modify some block or something they
03:06 - would need to actually do that on almost
03:09 - all of the computers that are on the
03:10 - blockchain because every blockchain is
03:12 - storing or sorry every computer is
03:14 - storing a copy of the blockchain so if
03:17 - you were to send through a malicious
03:18 - transaction it'd be very easy to detect
03:21 - because all of these other computers on
03:22 - the blockchain would say hey i don't
03:24 - have that transaction here that's not
03:26 - accurate we're not going to include that
03:28 - on the blockchain get rid of it now
03:30 - obviously i'm oversimplifying here but
03:33 - that's really the basics of how a
03:34 - blockchain works and that's why we call
03:36 - it decentralized because it's a
03:38 - distributed ledger across all of the
03:40 - computers on the network on the
03:42 - blockchain network and that means we can
03:45 - trust that everything on the blockchain
03:46 - is correct because there's not one
03:48 - centralized organization entity power
03:51 - government whatever controlling what
03:53 - goes on the blockchain it's a peer right
03:55 - or it's a group of computers all around
03:58 - the world sitting on the blockchain
04:00 - network so to end off this section i'll
04:01 - just say that the complete opposite of
04:03 - something like a blockchain would be
04:05 - something like a bank right a bank also
04:08 - has a ledger of transactions it keeps
04:10 - the balances of different accounts that
04:12 - are with that bank however this is all
04:14 - controlled by a central organization
04:16 - there's not a large group or a large
04:18 - network of computers or random people
04:21 - around the world controlling this it's
04:23 - one central institution and maybe this
04:25 - institution is backed by a government or
04:27 - something like that but that means you
04:28 - cannot be guaranteed that there won't be
04:31 - any malicious activity or stuff going on
04:33 - with the transactions occurring because
04:35 - there's only one entity controlling this
04:38 - it is centralized not decentralized so
04:40 - before moving forward i just want to
04:42 - quickly talk to you about some of the
04:43 - main advantages of decentralization
04:46 - now really the core advantage is you
04:48 - never have to worry about trust you
04:50 - never have to put your trust in a
04:52 - central organization institution
04:55 - government whatever it may be and that
04:57 - is really just a great thing because you
04:59 - know the famous saying goes absolute
05:02 - power corrupts absolutely and we can
05:04 - look in history and see lots of examples
05:06 - where a large institutional organization
05:09 - has been corrupted has been malicious
05:11 - and wasn't actually able to be trusted
05:13 - and you can go and look at a lot of
05:15 - other countries and see what they've
05:16 - done with their currency mass inflation
05:19 - stealing from the people go on you can
05:22 - find all kinds of examples but that's
05:23 - really the core advantage of
05:24 - decentralization is there's no need to
05:27 - trust i don't have to put my trust in
05:29 - you you don't have to put your trust in
05:31 - me we trust the entire network as a
05:34 - whole because it's next to impossible
05:36 - for any central entity organization to
05:39 - go in there and be malicious and do
05:41 - something fraudulent that is the
05:43 - advantage of decentralization and that's
05:45 - really the whole reason why
05:47 - cryptocurrency has become super popular
05:49 - especially in a lot of parts in the
05:51 - world where they cannot trust their
05:52 - government or cannot trust a banking
05:54 - organization or maybe don't even have
05:56 - access to that so finally we can start
05:58 - talking about d apps otherwise known as
06:00 - decentralized applications now d apps
06:03 - are really just decentralized apps
06:05 - that's all they are that means they use
06:07 - some type of blockchain technology and
06:09 - we can trust all of the code associated
06:11 - with this application because it's
06:13 - completely open source it never has any
06:16 - downtime and once it's added to the
06:18 - network it cannot be removed modified or
06:21 - changed so just like transactions we
06:23 - know we can trust when they're on the
06:24 - blockchain we know we can trust all of
06:27 - the code that's on the blockchain
06:28 - because we can see it ourself we know it
06:30 - cannot be changed or modified and we
06:32 - know it's never just going to disappear
06:34 - because the blockchain is always
06:36 - available the blockchain never goes down
06:38 - i won't explain that too much more but
06:39 - that's pretty much how it works now what
06:41 - is a smart contract well a smart
06:43 - contract as i was kind of alluding to is
06:46 - just code sitting on the blockchain it
06:48 - can be executed by the blockchain and
06:50 - you can think of it kind of like a set
06:52 - of rules the most basic example of a
06:54 - smart contract is something that allows
06:56 - you to exchange one coin for another so
06:59 - the best analogy that i've actually
07:01 - found for a smart contract is something
07:03 - like a vending machine so a vending
07:05 - machine stores money and it stores you
07:08 - know some type of goods right in this
07:10 - case maybe we'll say it stores chips or
07:12 - food or whatever if you give the correct
07:14 - amount of money to the vending machine
07:16 - you always get the good that you are
07:18 - looking for if you give too much money
07:20 - it gives you change no matter what it
07:22 - always works a smart contract is exactly
07:24 - the same way just like you might have
07:26 - your own ethereum wallet you can
07:28 - actually have ethereum stored in your
07:30 - smart contract or maybe some other type
07:32 - of good or service or coin or whatever
07:34 - it may be and every time you give
07:36 - certain input to this smart contract you
07:38 - always get the same output it can never
07:40 - be changed it's not malicious you can't
07:42 - go in and modify it or hack it and that
07:45 - is how we can trust applications that
07:46 - are on the blockchain because they are
07:48 - decentralized they work just like when i
07:51 - send you a coin on the blockchain so
07:53 - hopefully that's a decent enough
07:54 - explanation but you use smart contracts
07:57 - to add executable code to the blockchain
08:00 - and then that code is used by an
08:01 - application 8d app and that is why you
08:04 - know you can trust the application that
08:06 - you're using because it's distributed on
08:08 - the blockchain so what i just said
08:10 - sounds great and you're probably
08:11 - wondering why everyone doesn't just go
08:12 - use decentralized applications or
08:15 - actually make decentralized applications
08:17 - but the reason why is because there's a
08:19 - lot of disadvantages as well now the
08:21 - largest disadvantage with decentralized
08:23 - applications is the cost it just costs
08:26 - you a lot of money a lot of
08:27 - cryptocurrency to actually be able to
08:30 - run a decentralized application
08:32 - not only do you need to upload the smart
08:34 - contract to the blockchain that costs
08:36 - you money and transaction fees then you
08:38 - also need to use the smart contract make
08:40 - calls on the smart contract which costs
08:42 - you transaction fees and then if you
08:44 - want to store any information on the
08:46 - blockchain that's going to cost you
08:48 - money and it just is very very expensive
08:50 - even storing very small amounts of data
08:53 - on the blockchain can cost you literally
08:54 - hundreds if not thousands of dollars and
08:57 - well it doesn't make sense for a lot of
08:58 - companies or applications to use this
09:00 - because of the extremely high fees now
09:02 - some of the other main disadvantages of
09:04 - decentralized applications include the
09:06 - high latency it can take a lot of time
09:08 - to send transactions or upload new smart
09:10 - contracts poor user experience inability
09:14 - to manage a ton of private keys and
09:16 - wallets and all the other data that you
09:17 - need right now it's just not the best
09:19 - experience for developers fortunately
09:22 - though the sponsor of this video which
09:23 - is cartesi is trying to help that they
09:25 - have a bunch of different solutions you
09:27 - can check them out from the link in the
09:28 - description to lower the cost associated
09:30 - with creating decentralized applications
09:32 - and remove a lot of those headaches but
09:34 - still there's a lot of disadvantages
09:36 - even using some of these great solutions
09:38 - provided by companies like cartesi so as
09:40 - i was saying there is a lot of
09:42 - disadvantages and problems with
09:43 - decentralized applications however there
09:46 - is different types of solutions that can
09:47 - be implemented to make them more cost
09:49 - efficient and to make them have a lower
09:51 - latency now those solutions are
09:53 - categorized into layer 1 solutions and
09:55 - layer 2 solutions now layer 1 solutions
09:58 - use the underlying block chain
10:00 - technology so a layer 1 solution would
10:03 - be just using ethereum or using bitcoin
10:05 - using the actual cryptocurrency or
10:07 - blockchain itself now one solution
10:10 - within the layer one solutions is
10:12 - something called sharding now what
10:14 - sharding is is kind of splitting up all
10:16 - of the code or all of the you know
10:18 - aspects of a decentralized application
10:20 - into things called shards and then
10:22 - distributing that on the blockchain
10:25 - network such that it gets executed
10:27 - faster and you don't need to wait for
10:28 - say an entire massive large piece of
10:30 - code to be executed instead you have you
10:33 - know 20 or 30 pieces of code that are
10:34 - being executed or 20 or 30 shards that
10:37 - need to be you know run through the
10:39 - network and so you can kind of split
10:40 - this up and things can go a lot faster
10:42 - just like what would happen if you say
10:44 - split your application into multiple
10:46 - threads or multiple cores so that's one
10:48 - solution layer one solution called
10:50 - sharding that can kind of increase the
10:52 - speed and cost effectiveness sorry of
10:55 - using blockchain however then you have
10:58 - layer two solutions now layer 2
11:00 - solutions are typically more advanced
11:02 - and what they are is actually a
11:03 - technology or system that lies above the
11:06 - underlying block chain technology so an
11:09 - example of a layer 2 solution would be
11:11 - something like a state channel now a
11:13 - state channel is pretty complicated to
11:16 - explain but really it's a way that two
11:18 - users can communicate without using the
11:21 - blockchain in the way in which the
11:23 - blockchain would work a little bit
11:25 - confusing but it's like using the
11:27 - blockchain just not using the blockchain
11:29 - such that you don't have to pay the huge
11:31 - latency and cost associated with the
11:33 - blockchain so what happens is two users
11:36 - will communicate with each other using
11:38 - this state channel and then once the
11:40 - communication is done or the transaction
11:42 - is complete only then will it be
11:44 - uploaded to the blockchain so rather
11:46 - than say having a thousand
11:47 - microtransactions occurring on the
11:49 - blockchain you have those occur in the
11:50 - state channel and then those get wrapped
11:52 - into one larger transaction which then
11:55 - gets uploaded onto the blockchain
11:57 - again the purpose of that is to lower
11:59 - the latency and to make sure that you're
12:02 - not going to have to pay massive fees
12:03 - for all of the different transactions
12:05 - that are going through now in this video
12:06 - i'm not going to explain exactly how
12:08 - these solutions work i'm just trying to
12:10 - give you an idea of what's kind of going
12:12 - on out there and how people are trying
12:14 - to mitigate the disadvantages of the
12:16 - blockchain so these solutions as i
12:18 - stated them do still make sure that the
12:20 - trust is secure they use very advanced
12:22 - math and cryptography to make sure that
12:24 - everything is all good but those are
12:25 - just two examples of a layer one and a
12:27 - layer two solution and how you can kind
12:29 - of mitigate some of those disadvantages
12:31 - of the blockchain so i'm gonna start
12:33 - wrapping up the video here by just
12:34 - giving you two examples of decentralized
12:37 - applications so that you can kind of
12:38 - read about them and check them out for
12:40 - yourself so the first application is
12:42 - something called the uniswap now uniswap
12:44 - is a decentralized finance protocol so
12:47 - it's called d5 and this allows you to
12:49 - actually exchange cryptocurrencies for
12:51 - each other so this is a d app you can
12:53 - look up uniswap and kind of see how it
12:54 - works if you want to learn more about it
12:56 - but another more interesting one that
12:58 - was actually developed by cartesi using
13:00 - some of their solutions is called
13:03 - haudelum poker so hodl hodl is kind of
13:06 - the term in cryptocurrency for holding
13:08 - your coins no matter what never selling
13:10 - them so it's kind of a punny name in
13:12 - that sense but this is an implementation
13:14 - of poker texas hold'em in which it's
13:17 - actually decentralized so you don't have
13:19 - to worry about trusting some large poker
13:21 - organization or website there's actually
13:23 - a lot of history of poker websites and
13:25 - poker players specifically cheating and
13:27 - scamming other people in this case you
13:29 - just trust the blockchain and this
13:31 - allows you to play poker without
13:32 - worrying about you know being scammed or
13:34 - fraud or people seeing your cards or
13:36 - mixing up the shuffle whatever it may be
13:38 - so i'll leave a link to that game in the
13:40 - description there's a great video by
13:42 - cartesi that explains kind of how that
13:44 - works that you can check out but i think
13:46 - with that i'm going to end the video
13:47 - here so as i mentioned i did team up
13:49 - with cartesi to create this video they
13:51 - helped me come up with a lot of the
13:52 - content that i shared here they're the
13:55 - true blockchain and cryptocurrency
13:57 - experts well you should check them out
13:58 - from the link in the description they
14:00 - provide a lot of layer one and layer two
14:02 - solutions to help create d apps
14:05 - decentralized applications and really
14:07 - mitigate some of those disadvantages
14:08 - that i talked about before look for some
14:10 - more videos coming from them in the
14:12 - future related to actually creating d
14:14 - apps and let me know what you thought of
14:15 - this video in the comments down below
14:17 - with that said like the video if you
14:19 - enjoyed subscribe to the channel and i
14:20 - will see you in another one
14:24 - [Music]
14:30 - you
