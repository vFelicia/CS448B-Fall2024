00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:02 - YouTube video so I just want to start
00:04 - off by apologizing I haven't been
00:06 - posting for about the past five days
00:08 - have been extremely busy and I haven't
00:10 - found the time to record any videos so
00:12 - I'm trying to get this one out for you
00:13 - guys today and I am working on doing a
00:15 - whole series on what I'm gonna be
00:17 - showing you which is tkinter so
00:19 - hopefully I'm gonna have a tutorial
00:20 - series for that out in about a week or
00:22 - so but for now it's a little sneak peek
00:24 - on some of the things you can do using a
00:26 - tkinter molecule and Pegeen now this
00:29 - video is gonna go over how to create a
00:31 - message box in tkinter in Python sorry
00:35 - not pi game Python all those can be used
00:37 - in PI game as well and it's extremely
00:39 - useful as a lot of times you want to
00:40 - display information to the user you want
00:42 - to ask them a question but you don't
00:44 - want to create your own form for that
00:45 - you just want to have a simple line that
00:46 - you can type in that's gonna allow you
00:48 - to do that so I'm gonna show you an
00:49 - example here quickly what I mean so for
00:51 - example we have this message box that
00:53 - pops up it says question and that do you
00:55 - have brown hair and they obviously you
00:57 - would say yes or no for this this is
00:59 - just an example of where it has the
01:00 - option to click OK so that would just be
01:02 - something where you're showing
01:02 - information to the user so let's get
01:05 - started right away with the tutorial on
01:07 - how to do this I'm gonna be showing you
01:08 - all different kinds of message boxes and
01:09 - the if you want to skip about a minute
01:12 - or two in that's where I'm gonna be
01:14 - talking about the question message box
01:16 - is where it says yes/no for example okay
01:18 - so we want to start here by just
01:21 - importing these two these two things up
01:24 - here so we have from tkinter import
01:25 - starters means to import everything and
01:27 - then from tkinter import message box so
01:30 - this just means that we don't have to
01:31 - type tkinter dot message box every
01:33 - single time so it makes you have those
01:35 - two lines and then we're gonna set up
01:36 - our main window now this window is
01:38 - actually gonna be invisible but pretty
01:39 - much whenever you should want to do
01:40 - anything in tkinter you have to have a
01:42 - window set up so we just set up the
01:44 - window to start so that we can make it
01:46 - disappear so that it's you'll see what I
01:47 - mean in just a second I'll show you so
01:49 - we say window equals TK windowed eval
01:53 - all this is gonna do here this line if
01:55 - you want to copy it out is simply gonna
01:56 - put our window in the middle of the
01:58 - screen on the top level of everything so
02:02 - that means that once we open up the
02:04 - window once we have the program it's not
02:06 - going to be hidden behind another window
02:07 - it's gonna make sure it's as for as far
02:11 - in front as possible a lot of times what
02:14 - if you don't put this is it's gonna end
02:15 - up behind something and you're not gonna
02:17 - be able to see it so it's a really
02:18 - useful line to put and then we're just
02:20 - gonna withdraw our window and what this
02:21 - does is it's gonna make our window
02:23 - invisible so still going to be on the
02:24 - top level we're just not going to be
02:26 - able to see it so that the all we're
02:30 - gonna see is the message box when it
02:31 - pops up so if I get rid of this line
02:33 - here I'll show you what I mean in case
02:34 - anybody's confused pretty much you see
02:36 - we have this ugly little window behind
02:37 - so we want to make that disappear so
02:39 - that's why we do with drill ok the next
02:42 - line here is the line it's actually
02:44 - gonna show our message box so to do any
02:46 - message box starts off with message box
02:48 - dot and then show you can also do show
02:50 - error show warning these are the
02:53 - different kind of icons that you can use
02:55 - and it's gonna say this is gonna be our
02:58 - title here on the first set of
03:00 - quotations on a comma and then the
03:02 - context or the text that's gonna be on
03:04 - it so you saw mine if I ran the program
03:07 - here we have this the title and then
03:10 - thing here and it's the little info icon
03:14 - now if you wanted to show an error you
03:15 - would type show air and all that this
03:20 - does is it changes a little icon to an X
03:22 - showing an error the other one that they
03:24 - have is show warning like that there you
03:29 - go the warning sign those are the three
03:31 - different icons for the text boxes these
03:35 - last lines here these just make sure
03:36 - that we're quitting our window once we
03:38 - are finished so that it's no longer
03:39 - shown on the screen so make sure you've
03:43 - got put this in at the bottom usually
03:44 - all I do is window dot quit but these
03:46 - two just ensure that everything's gone
03:48 - ok after that now I'm gonna show you
03:51 - guys how we can ask the question so ask
03:53 - yes or no so for example this question
03:55 - here do you have brown hair really it
03:58 - should it shouldn't just say ok we
04:00 - should be able to answer yes or no so to
04:02 - be able to do that we're gonna say
04:03 - message box dot then ask and we're just
04:07 - gonna say yes no so this is gonna ask a
04:09 - yes/no question is just gonna allow us
04:11 - to have the buttons yes/no on our thing
04:13 - you can see here do you have brown hair
04:15 - and now we're able to answer with either
04:16 - a yes or a No
04:17 - now the thing is though we can answer
04:20 - the question but how do we actually
04:21 - check the answer because right now
04:23 - nothing's happening it's just we're
04:25 - simply clicking the button and then the
04:27 - way
04:27 - disappears so to do so all you have to
04:29 - do is before your message box you do if
04:32 - so now we're just going to be checking
04:34 - if the result of this message box is
04:36 - equal to true meaning it's equal to yes
04:39 - then we'll simply print we'll say yes
04:44 - otherwise we will print no and then that
04:50 - way we're able to get the answer to our
04:51 - question so if we click run the program
04:54 - do you have brown hair click no it says
04:57 - no there again if we do this one more
04:59 - time do you have brown hair I click yes
05:01 - yes there you so that's a pretty useful
05:05 - there now say you wanted this to be a
05:06 - different icon so you saw we have a
05:08 - little info icon there if you click if
05:10 - you do a little column at the end and
05:12 - you say icon you can set it equal to
05:14 - what you like so info warning or air
05:21 - like so and then that way it'll change
05:24 - the icon for you so now you see that we
05:26 - have the little error icon here now
05:28 - these are really useful just in a bunch
05:30 - of programs to be able to use and that
05:33 - you'll find them really helpful if you
05:35 - just want to ask a simple question for
05:36 - the user you don't want to create a new
05:38 - form the other types of message box that
05:40 - we can do is we can say ask ok cancel so
05:44 - this is gonna be a similar thing if you
05:46 - click OK gives you the yes because
05:49 - that's the true I don't know that's how
05:51 - it works and same thing if you click
05:53 - cancel then it gives you no we can also
05:56 - ask one other type for these little
05:59 - questions which is retry or cancel so
06:05 - there you have we have the buttons
06:07 - change down to retry or cancel again if
06:08 - you click retry that get that returns
06:10 - true from the message box so yeah that's
06:13 - pretty much been my tutorial on how to
06:15 - create a message box in Python using
06:17 - tkinter if you guys have any questions
06:19 - feel free to leave them down below I'll
