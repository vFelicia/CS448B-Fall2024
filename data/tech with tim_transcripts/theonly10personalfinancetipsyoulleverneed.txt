00:00 - in my opinion personal finance is pretty
00:02 - straightforward and what it comes down
00:04 - to for most people is having the
00:05 - discipline and the correct mindset
00:07 - related to money and applying that
00:09 - consistently you do not need to be a
00:11 - math whiz you do not need to be a
00:13 - university graduate and you do not need
00:14 - to binge watch finance youtubers to
00:16 - understand the key concepts and have the
00:19 - correct mindset to save money and get
00:21 - richer so in this video i'm going to
00:23 - share with you as quickly as i can 10
00:25 - finance tips that have genuinely changed
00:27 - my life and allowed me to accumulate a
00:29 - net worth of close to a million dollars
00:31 - at the age of 22. now i don't say that
00:34 - to brag just to provide a little bit of
00:36 - credibility for some context here i have
00:38 - been working ever since i was 14 years
00:40 - old i started off making a few thousand
00:42 - dollars per summer all the way up to
00:44 - hundreds of thousands of dollars per
00:46 - year at this current stage in my life i
00:48 - do not claim to be a finance expert but
00:50 - these things are what i keep in the back
00:52 - of my mind every single day would have
00:54 - allowed me to accumulate this much
00:56 - wealth at such a young age so take that
00:58 - for what you will but i'm going to share
01:00 - some tips with you hopefully these help
01:02 - you or at least get your mind in the
01:03 - correct place when it comes to thinking
01:05 - about money
01:09 - [Music]
01:14 - so finance tip number one is that there
01:16 - is endless opportunity to make money now
01:19 - i know a lot of people don't believe
01:20 - this and a lot of people like to claim
01:22 - that they're just not in a position
01:23 - where they can do this for some that may
01:26 - be true but for most people watching
01:27 - this video there is always something
01:29 - extra you can do if you want to generate
01:32 - more income now i can recall being in
01:34 - grade 8 and selling like little silly
01:36 - band wristband type things to my friends
01:39 - selling chocolate bars selling pokemon
01:41 - cards anything i could do to make an
01:42 - extra five or ten dollars i was doing
01:44 - that i recalled jailbreaking people's
01:46 - phones and charging them 20 bucks to
01:48 - jailbreak the ipod or the iphone or
01:50 - whatever it was back in that day and
01:52 - even though that wasn't a substantial
01:53 - amount of money it kind of built this
01:55 - habit into my brain of constantly
01:57 - looking for ways where i could be
01:58 - generating extra income and then
02:00 - potentially taking on that opportunity
02:02 - so keep that in the back of your head
02:04 - because you might think that there's no
02:05 - extra way to do something or that you're
02:07 - limited with your job or whatever you're
02:09 - currently doing there is always
02:11 - something you can do to make more money
02:12 - and you really need to keep that
02:14 - ingrained in the back of your brain now
02:15 - to give you a concrete example of this
02:17 - in my videos i always take the
02:19 - opportunity to talk about programming
02:21 - expert dot io the best course to learn
02:23 - how to become a software engineer and
02:25 - something that makes me money if you buy
02:27 - from the link in the description all
02:28 - right so finance tip number two and this
02:30 - is absolutely fundamental i know many of
02:32 - you have heard this before but this is
02:34 - that it is not what you make it is what
02:36 - you keep now this is probably the most
02:39 - important tip on this list because
02:40 - really at the end of the day it doesn't
02:42 - matter if you make a million dollars if
02:44 - you spend 950. yes your life may be a
02:47 - little bit better because you have all
02:49 - of these nice nice things sorry but
02:51 - you've likely taken on a lot of debt a
02:52 - lot of liability a lot of risk and now
02:55 - the next year you're kind of trapped in
02:57 - this bubble of having to make a million
02:59 - dollars because you're spending 950k a
03:01 - year you're spending whatever the amount
03:03 - is personally i would much rather make
03:05 - 200 000 a year and only spend 50 than
03:08 - make 500 and spend 450. it really does
03:12 - not matter how much money you make up
03:14 - until a certain point obviously it
03:16 - matters how much you keep and you really
03:18 - need to keep that in the back of your
03:19 - head because even though you make a ton
03:21 - of money what's the point if you're
03:22 - trying to build wealth if you're
03:24 - spending all of it immediately so
03:25 - finance tip number three is that if you
03:27 - cannot handle a thousand dollars you
03:29 - cannot handle a million now really you
03:31 - can put this on any scale but the point
03:34 - here is that your ability to handle
03:35 - money does not increase or decrease when
03:37 - that amount of money goes up if you
03:40 - cannot handle a thousand dollars if you
03:41 - cannot budget if you cannot figure out
03:43 - how much money is coming in and out how
03:45 - much you need how much you have to save
03:47 - how much you're spending in a month
03:48 - you're not going to be able to do the
03:49 - same thing with an even larger amount of
03:51 - money you hear the saying more money
03:53 - more problems now that's not always the
03:55 - case but i can say personally that my
03:57 - financial situation situation sorry has
03:59 - gotten a lot more complicated the more
04:02 - money that i've gained now of course
04:03 - that's partly due to me and trying to
04:05 - manage it properly and put it in the
04:06 - correct accounts and have the correct
04:08 - investments and not be getting decimated
04:10 - by inflation but i'm just saying that if
04:12 - you can't handle a small amount don't
04:14 - think you're going to be able to handle
04:15 - a large amount and start practicing now
04:17 - with whatever money you have because as
04:19 - soon as you get some more those skills
04:21 - are going to translate and kind of come
04:23 - over now tip number four this really
04:25 - applies to anything in life but
04:26 - especially money and finances and this
04:28 - is what gets tracked gets improved now i
04:31 - think this is pretty obvious but if you
04:33 - are tracking your finances that gives
04:35 - you an opportunity to improve them if
04:37 - you're not tracking something there's
04:39 - just no way to improve it it's just like
04:41 - in programming i'm not able to fix a bug
04:43 - if i don't know what the bug is in this
04:45 - case how do i fix a financial issue if i
04:47 - don't even know what the problem is it
04:49 - is extremely important even at a very
04:51 - basic level to know exactly how much
04:53 - money is coming in and exactly how much
04:55 - money is coming out and how much you are
04:57 - left with at the end of the month and
04:59 - then you can very easily see where you
05:01 - can optimize things we can cut things
05:03 - out of your budget or maybe you want to
05:05 - spend more money if you think that
05:06 - that's actually beneficial for example i
05:08 - run a business i have bookkeepers i have
05:10 - accountants and at the end of the year
05:12 - i'm constantly doing all of these
05:14 - optimizations seeing where i can cut out
05:16 - spending seeing where i may want to
05:18 - actually increase the budget because
05:19 - that's leading to productivity you need
05:21 - to actually be tracking your stuff
05:23 - because anything that gets tracked does
05:25 - get improved so finance tip number five
05:28 - and i want to put a special emphasis on
05:30 - this that investing and saving is a
05:32 - habit this is something that should be
05:34 - automatic for you that you shouldn't
05:36 - have to think about and that should
05:37 - hopefully be done automatically right
05:39 - where you actually have a withdrawal set
05:42 - up every month for money to come out of
05:43 - your account go into a different account
05:45 - you want your saving and investing to be
05:48 - something that is just so instinctual so
05:50 - ingrained into the back of your brain
05:52 - that it doesn't matter how much money
05:53 - you have you're always going to be doing
05:55 - this now the reason i bring this up is
05:57 - because i see so often people say i'm
05:59 - going to start investing when i have 5
06:01 - grand or 10 grand or 20 grand or 30
06:03 - grand whatever the number is now unless
06:05 - you're literally starving and you can't
06:07 - actually afford to survive like you're
06:09 - using all of the money that you have you
06:11 - have no reason to not be able to put
06:13 - away 10 bucks a month or 50 bucks a
06:16 - month or a hundred bucks a month you
06:18 - just need to pick a number that is
06:19 - reasonable and that you can commit to to
06:21 - start building a habit of doing this
06:24 - again if you don't do this when you have
06:26 - a thousand dollars what makes you think
06:27 - you're gonna do it when you have ten
06:29 - thousand you need to build the habit you
06:31 - need to ingrain this into the back of
06:32 - your brain and ideally by the time you
06:34 - get to the point where your investments
06:36 - and savings are going to be more
06:37 - meaningful you just do it immediately
06:39 - you don't even think about it it's just
06:40 - done because you've been doing it for so
06:42 - long so tip number six is to utilize
06:45 - credit there's a ton of benefits of this
06:47 - but really the main point here is not to
06:49 - be scared to have something like a
06:51 - credit card for some reason i know a
06:52 - bunch of people who are like terrified
06:54 - of holding a credit card they don't want
06:56 - to buy anything on it they're scared
06:58 - they're not going to pay it off whatever
06:59 - the reason is now if you genuinely know
07:01 - yourself and you know you can't handle
07:03 - that that's a different scenario but a
07:04 - lot of people just have this stigma
07:06 - around credit cards and they don't
07:08 - realize that it's a very beneficial to
07:10 - use one and in fact i would buy
07:12 - everything i possibly could on a credit
07:14 - card uh if i was allowed to do that
07:16 - right if i don't have to pay cash for
07:17 - something i'm always going to buy it on
07:19 - a credit card it gives you liquidity
07:20 - benefits in emergencies it's very good
07:23 - to have a high credit limit if you
07:24 - needed to utilize that and if you know
07:27 - yourself you know your habits you know
07:28 - you're going to pay it off then there is
07:30 - absolutely no reason to not want to
07:32 - utilize that i'll just leave you on a
07:33 - last point here the reason why right now
07:36 - at 22 years old i can buy a house
07:38 - without a cosigner is because i have
07:40 - utilized credit over the last four years
07:42 - i have a car loan i have a credit cards
07:45 - multiple credit cards i have a line of
07:47 - credit i had a mortgage previously but
07:49 - now i'm moving to my new house that was
07:51 - actually secured like i had a cosigner
07:53 - on that but i wasn't afraid to have
07:55 - these different things because i knew i
07:56 - could handle the liabilities related to
07:58 - them and i knew i was going to pay them
08:00 - off and now i'm in a position where i'm
08:01 - very thankful that i did have those
08:03 - specific things and did utilize that
08:05 - credit so tip number seven here is that
08:07 - accountants are worth the money now take
08:09 - this with a grain of salt if you have a
08:11 - very simple financial setup like if you
08:12 - just have a single job no businesses
08:14 - anything like that you can probably do
08:17 - anything related to taxes or what you
08:19 - need an account for yourself but in my
08:21 - situation here i run multiple companies
08:23 - my personal finances are very
08:25 - complicated with investments and all
08:26 - this type of stuff and i just need
08:28 - accountants to do this for me in fact i
08:30 - have kind of a main accounting team and
08:32 - then i have a bookkeeper and my
08:34 - bookkeeper will go in every single month
08:36 - and just keep things nice and tidy so
08:38 - that i'm able to get a good picture of
08:40 - kind of my financial position and then
08:42 - have these financial statements prepared
08:44 - at the end of the year and all of this
08:45 - type of stuff i'm just saying this
08:47 - because a lot of people like to skimp on
08:50 - accountants so they don't want to pay
08:51 - the price the reality is anything you
08:53 - pay them they're probably gonna make you
08:55 - back times two i know this year i paid
08:57 - my accountants probably something like
08:59 - thirteen thousand dollars and they
09:00 - probably would have saved me close to
09:01 - fifty thousand dollars in taxes right
09:03 - and just the knowledge that they can
09:05 - provide that alone is worth a lot of
09:07 - money right having an hour-long
09:08 - conversation with an accountant you can
09:10 - learn a lot more than you would if you
09:12 - went to an hour-long lecture in school
09:14 - at least from my perspective so that is
09:16 - tip number seven trust your accountants
09:18 - they're usually worth the money so tip
09:20 - number eight here is related to
09:22 - investing and this is to diversify but
09:24 - to not overdo it now of course anything
09:26 - i say in this video take with a grain of
09:28 - salt i'm not a cpa i'm not a financial
09:30 - advisor this is just strictly from my
09:32 - perspective so if you disagree with me
09:34 - that's fine but in my opinion
09:36 - diversification is very important when
09:38 - it comes to portfolio you want to be
09:39 - invested in different types of
09:41 - investments different assets you want to
09:43 - be holding some cash you want to be
09:45 - holding some low risk investments some
09:47 - high risk investments etc but you don't
09:49 - want to get to the point where you're
09:50 - overdoing it and you can't keep track of
09:52 - everything that you have for me i have
09:55 - probably eight or nine different
09:56 - investments and that alone is very
09:58 - difficult to handle especially when it
10:00 - comes to tax season and there's all
10:01 - these slips and forms you need to do and
10:04 - if you can't actually be tracking and
10:06 - managing your investments it's probably
10:08 - not worth having them at least in my
10:10 - perspective i see some people that have
10:11 - a hundred grand and they have 100
10:13 - different investments right where they
10:14 - put 10 grand or one grand surrey in each
10:16 - of them personally for me if i had a
10:18 - hundred thousand dollars right now to
10:20 - invest i'd probably have three or four
10:22 - different investments i'd be holding
10:24 - some cash i'd be keeping it diversified
10:26 - but also relatively simple so it's easy
10:28 - enough for me to manage and track take
10:31 - that for what you will but that is tip
10:32 - number eight so moving on to tip number
10:35 - nine and this one is that when you are
10:36 - just starting out you should focus on
10:38 - making money as opposed to investing try
10:41 - to increase your annual income as fast
10:43 - as you can rather than be spending all
10:46 - of your time picking out different
10:47 - investments now i see so many people
10:49 - especially my age all this crypto and
10:51 - nft stuff going on they spend like
10:53 - countless hours per day like researching
10:55 - these cryptos and these coins and
10:57 - they're trying to buy nfts and they're
10:58 - trying to do all this stuff in the stock
11:00 - market but they only have five grand to
11:02 - their name i'm like look that's great
11:03 - but even if you hit a home run here the
11:05 - most you're gonna make is like 20 grand
11:07 - okay yeah that seems like a lot from
11:09 - their perspective but if you were
11:10 - instead putting your time into
11:12 - developing skills building a career
11:15 - trying to find a good job you'd probably
11:17 - make way more than that in a longer term
11:20 - and that's way less risky than trying to
11:23 - kind of gamble on these different stocks
11:24 - and cryptocurrencies so that's kind of
11:26 - my point here when you're just starting
11:28 - out and you're not making a lot of money
11:30 - your time is going to be much better
11:32 - spent trying to earn more money and
11:34 - actually working for that rather than
11:36 - trying to generate passive income from
11:38 - investments personally for me i didn't
11:40 - really get serious sorry about my
11:42 - investments until i had a net worth of
11:44 - about 150 000
11:46 - some people may say that that is a
11:48 - little bit late but for me my main focus
11:50 - was just on trying to earn more money
11:52 - every single year optimizing my revenue
11:55 - streams trying to cut back on expenses
11:57 - that i had in the business and then once
11:59 - i got to a point where i'm like okay i
12:01 - actually have a large sum of money now
12:03 - let's focus on exactly where i'm going
12:04 - to be putting that and try to optimize
12:06 - that area again it doesn't really make
12:09 - sense to be focusing on the investments
12:10 - when you have such a small amount at
12:12 - that point i'd say build the habit focus
12:14 - on earning and then once you get further
12:16 - on you can actually kind of optimize all
12:18 - those investments go in you know put
12:21 - them in different areas get a financial
12:22 - advisor whatever you want to do so
12:24 - moving on to point number 10 and i'm
12:26 - just going to wrap up the video here
12:28 - with this one and that is that money
12:29 - cannot buy happiness but it can buy
12:32 - freedom now for me personally my entire
12:35 - focus on money has really been around
12:37 - this idea that the more money that i
12:39 - accumulate the more free that i am the
12:41 - more that i don't have to listen to
12:43 - other people the more that i can get up
12:44 - whenever i want i can do whatever i want
12:47 - and i can essentially pick what i want
12:49 - to do with my life because i have the
12:50 - financial resources to do that now i'm
12:52 - not talking about buying jets or yachts
12:54 - or ferraris or anything crazy like this
12:56 - i'm talking about not having to get up
12:58 - and go to a job that i hate because of
13:00 - the fact that i need to make x dollars
13:03 - per month now that also really has to do
13:05 - with how much money you're spending
13:07 - right if you need to be making 200 000 a
13:10 - year half a million dollars a year to
13:11 - satisfy your liabilities that's probably
13:13 - a pretty negative thing and you probably
13:15 - don't have very much freedom whereas if
13:17 - you make 50 grand a year but you have no
13:19 - debt you have no expenses all you need
13:22 - to do is maybe eat and pay for like the
13:24 - basic living necessities you're probably
13:26 - a lot more free than someone that is in
13:28 - this corporate job that they're stuck in
13:29 - because they have a two million dollar
13:31 - mortgage hopefully you get what i'm
13:32 - saying here but this has really been why
13:34 - i've had this focus on money is trying
13:36 - to achieve this freedom where i'm able
13:39 - to essentially do whatever i want i
13:41 - control my life no one else does and
13:44 - again i don't have to bow down to
13:45 - someone with a paycheck saying hey you
13:47 - have to do this so that you can continue
13:49 - living this let's say inflated lifestyle
13:51 - that you've created for yourself so with
13:53 - that said guys i think i'm going to wrap
13:54 - up the video here i don't typically do
13:56 - these finance style videos and this is
13:58 - kind of a one-off on the channel so i'm
14:00 - not sure how you guys are gonna react to
14:02 - it but hopefully this provided some
14:04 - value and at minimum gave you something
14:06 - to think about and maybe uh reflect on
14:08 - in your own life anyways if you guys
14:10 - like this style of content then leave a
14:12 - comment down below i'd be more than
14:14 - happy to post some more finance kind of
14:16 - money investing type stuff on the
14:18 - channel in the future
14:19 - and with that said if you enjoyed make
14:21 - sure to leave a like subscribe the
14:22 - channel i will see you in the next one
