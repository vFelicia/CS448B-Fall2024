00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:01 - video so in today's video I'm going to
00:03 - be talking to you about five Python
00:05 - project ideas for beginners now I'm not
00:08 - gonna give super specific stuff here but
00:10 - I want to give you guys some kind of
00:11 - inspiration and just make you aware of
00:13 - some of the stuff you can do with Python
00:14 - because as a beginner you probably don't
00:17 - know about the extensive modulus Python
00:19 - has as well as some of the really
00:21 - interesting stuff that can be really
00:22 - useful to you
00:23 - and actually make apps that you know you
00:25 - can use in your everyday life so without
00:27 - further ado let's go ahead and get
00:30 - started now before I tell you about the
00:32 - first Python project I just want to say
00:34 - that it's really important that you are
00:36 - working on projects and it doesn't
00:38 - matter what they are how small or how
00:40 - large but that you are applying your
00:42 - knowledge by yourself without kind of
00:45 - following along with tutorial videos or
00:46 - having someone walk you through it now
00:49 - to toriel videos are great and they
00:50 - teach you a ton but to really apply your
00:53 - knowledge and make sure you understand
00:54 - everything you need to be working by
00:57 - yourself every once in a while on a
00:59 - project and that's why I'm trying to
01:00 - give you guys some ideas here so project
01:03 - number one that I recommend you guys
01:04 - work on as a beginner is some kind of
01:07 - login system now this can be really
01:09 - basic and just something that's in your
01:11 - little Python console where you ask the
01:13 - person for a username and password or to
01:16 - create an account so if they don't have
01:17 - an account they can make one you ask
01:19 - them for an email username two passwords
01:21 - confirm those passwords are correct and
01:23 - then store that information in some kind
01:25 - of text file or database if you're real
01:27 - beginner I'd recommend it's using a text
01:29 - file and then you can allow the user to
01:31 - log in as well so maybe you have a page
01:33 - that says like would you like to create
01:34 - an account or log in based on what they
01:36 - type they have those options and then
01:39 - it's gonna save that information and
01:40 - validate every time they log in against
01:42 - the text file now the next project that
01:46 - I recommend you guys work on is some
01:47 - kind of card game now these ones can be
01:50 - a bit more advanced depending on what
01:51 - game you pick but two card games that I
01:53 - usually like to recommend are blackjack
01:56 - or rummy now you might not know where
01:57 - rummy is but if you look it up you'll
01:59 - kind of see how that works and you can
02:01 - obviously make modifications to it based
02:03 - on whatever you like but I actually use
02:05 - blackjack in my program of course which
02:07 - you can find down below right now for
02:08 - 35% off as the final project so it suits
02:12 - really nicely
02:13 - as a beginner project to work on now
02:16 - project three that I like to work on is
02:19 - something with Excel spreadsheets now
02:22 - this is less of a very specific project
02:24 - but just making you guys aware that
02:26 - there actually is a module with Python
02:27 - that allows you to read and write to
02:29 - Excel spreadsheets
02:30 - now this is super easy to learn I picked
02:33 - it up myself in about 15-20 minutes and
02:35 - using this you can create some really
02:37 - cool applications and one of the ones
02:39 - that I made with it is something that
02:41 - tracks my expenses so super basic but
02:43 - essentially you just type into the
02:45 - command prompt what the expense was how
02:48 - much it cost and whatever day it was on
02:50 - and then it will add that to an Excel
02:52 - spreadsheet and start keeping track for
02:54 - you and this is super easy to do and
02:57 - just a great beginner project it's also
02:59 - something nice to do you know if you're
03:00 - worried about saving money or all of
03:01 - that
03:02 - now with this excel sheet you can do all
03:04 - kinds of crazy stuff and the more
03:05 - advanced you are obviously the more
03:07 - crazy stuff you can do with this module
03:10 - but it's something I definitely
03:11 - recommend learning as it'll open up a
03:12 - ton of project ideas for you guys and
03:14 - I'll leave a link to that module in the
03:16 - description and the pinned comment
03:18 - alright so the next project that I
03:21 - recommend you guys work on is something
03:23 - for some of you graphics people out
03:25 - there and this is a turtle module now
03:27 - again less of a specific project but
03:29 - just a module and Python that's really
03:31 - nice to use and super easy to pick up I
03:34 - actually have some tutorials on it on my
03:36 - channel but essentially it allows you to
03:38 - just have a really basic kind of
03:40 - graphics that you can use in Python so
03:42 - you can visualize stuff you can draw
03:43 - nice pictures and something I've
03:45 - actually done with it is create what's
03:46 - called a turtle race now the turtle race
03:49 - that I had there's just a bunch of
03:50 - turtles lined up at the bottom of the
03:51 - screen when you hit go or you hit space
03:54 - they all start going up the screen and
03:55 - then keep track of which one won in a
03:58 - text file for scores so that's an idea
04:00 - of a project I've done with it you can
04:02 - do all kinds of cool stuff again I have
04:04 - tutorials on my channel if you'd like to
04:05 - check those out now the last project I
04:08 - recommend as a beginner and this one's
04:10 - more specific is tic-tac-toe now this
04:12 - one seems pretty straightforward and
04:14 - pretty easy but there's actually a lot
04:16 - of things to think about with this
04:17 - project you have to keep track of not
04:19 - only the players moves but the computers
04:21 - moves as well if you're going to play
04:22 - against a computer which is an option or
04:24 - you could play against another person
04:25 - you have to make sure
04:27 - that the person hasn't won yet or you
04:28 - have to check all those different lines
04:30 - which means you got to work with lists
04:32 - and that can be kind of challenging if
04:34 - you're a beginner and that's why I
04:35 - recommend it as well you have to make
04:37 - sure you're getting valid input for
04:38 - where the person's putting either an X
04:40 - or an O and then if you're playing
04:41 - against a computer you have to make sure
04:43 - that computers making either random
04:45 - moves or logical moves which means you
04:47 - have to have a little bit of an
04:48 - algorithm on picking those moves now I'm
04:51 - making the sound a little bit harder
04:52 - than it is but I do have some tutorials
04:53 - on my channel I'd recommend you guys try
04:56 - the project yourself first and then go
04:58 - look at those for some help but again
05:00 - feel free to check those out I'll leave
05:02 - a card right now all right so with that
05:05 - being said this has been a short video
05:06 - hopefully I gave you guys a few really
05:08 - simple ideas for some projects to work
05:10 - on with Python again if you can't think
05:12 - of anything I really recommend that you
05:14 - learn that excel module as well as the
05:16 - turtle module because they open up a
05:18 - whole list of possibilities for things
05:20 - that you can do and you can create some
05:21 - really useful applications so if you
05:24 - guys enjoyed the video make sure you
05:25 - leave a like to help me out and
05:26 - subscribe to the channel down below and
05:28 - I guess I will see you guys in another
05:30 - video
