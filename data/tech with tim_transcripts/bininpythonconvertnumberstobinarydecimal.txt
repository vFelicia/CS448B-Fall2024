00:00 - sometimes when you're writing code in
00:01 - python you want to convert a number to
00:03 - binary fortunately there's a function
00:05 - that does that for us in python we can
00:07 - say x is equal to bin this is the binary
00:10 - number function this takes in a number
00:12 - and converts it to binary so if i print
00:14 - out x i'll actually get a string that
00:16 - represents the binary number now notice
00:18 - it always starts with zero b if you want
00:20 - to remove this zero b then you can take
00:22 - a slice of this so two colon that will
00:24 - strip off the first two characters now
00:26 - you just have the binary number now in
00:28 - case you want to go from binary back to
00:30 - decimal you can do the following y is
00:32 - equal to and then int and you can pass
00:34 - in your binary number make sure you do
00:36 - not have the zero b on it though you
00:37 - take the slice and then you put two here
00:39 - this represents that you're going to use
00:40 - a base two numbering system and so when
00:42 - you go here and you print out y then you
00:44 - will get 162 back hopefully this was
00:47 - helpful if it was follow for more
