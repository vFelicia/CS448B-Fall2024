00:02 - [Music]
00:06 - hello everyone and welcome back to
00:09 - another YouTube video so in today's
00:10 - video what I'm gonna do is talk to you
00:12 - but when I actually work on at Microsoft
00:14 - as a software engineer in turn now I'm
00:17 - excited about this video and I think
00:18 - this is really cool because I can
00:20 - actually give you guys some really good
00:21 - insight into what it's like to work as a
00:23 - software engineer at a big tech company
00:25 - and what you actually do on a day to day
00:27 - basis and the reason I'm able to do that
00:29 - and I'm actually gonna be able to show
00:31 - you all of the code that I've written so
00:32 - far is because this is an open-source
00:35 - project so I'm actually on the BS code
00:38 - Python extension team working on data
00:41 - science related features so vs code is a
00:43 - very popular code editor it looks like
00:46 - this I'm sure you guys have seen it
00:47 - before if you're into programming at all
00:49 - and it is one of the most popular code
00:51 - editors in the world if not the most
00:53 - popular one within it there's a bunch of
00:55 - things called extension so actually I
00:57 - should leave this up if I come here and
00:59 - I go to the extensions pane which is on
01:01 - the side here you can see all of the
01:03 - extensions I have enabled one of which
01:05 - is the Python extension so this right
01:07 - here if you've installed this you may
01:09 - potentially be seeing changes that I've
01:11 - actually made to this extension so the
01:14 - extension is essentially a way to
01:15 - support extra features just other things
01:18 - in vs code related normally to specific
01:21 - programming languages you can see here
01:23 - there's like a react extension there's
01:25 - all these different kind of extensions
01:27 - some of them are produced by Microsoft
01:28 - and some of them are third-party
01:30 - extensions but one of the reasons this
01:32 - is able to be open source is because you
01:34 - know it's not really a huge deal it just
01:35 - is the Python extension for vs code so
01:38 - within that there's a bunch of different
01:40 - areas there's the core extension team
01:42 - there's the language server team which
01:44 - is responsible for doing all the
01:46 - intellisense and all of your code
01:47 - completions and then there's the data
01:49 - science team which I'm on and the data
01:51 - science team is responsible for making
01:53 - data science features that helped out a
01:55 - scientist right so people that are
01:57 - working in machine learning and AI
01:58 - they're working with Jupiter notebooks
02:01 - and in fact I'm going to show you some
02:03 - of the features I'm working on in a
02:04 - second that are very heavily related to
02:06 - job Jupiter notebooks excuse me on that
02:09 - one but what I wanted to show you though
02:10 - is kind of how it works in terms of how
02:13 - do I
02:13 - actually push code how do I figure out
02:15 - what to work on how do we prioritize
02:17 - issues I think that's a cool thing to
02:19 - show so I wanted to show you that we use
02:21 - github for all of this
02:23 - so github is a really powerful tool I
02:25 - knew it was powerful but not until I
02:27 - started working at Microsoft which owns
02:29 - github by the way I realized how
02:31 - powerful it really is and how many
02:33 - things you can do with it so first of
02:35 - all this is the repository so this is
02:37 - the entire code base for the Python
02:39 - extension for Visual Studio code I'll
02:42 - put this in the description and you guys
02:43 - can go and look at this all you want you
02:45 - can mess with it you can actually
02:46 - contribute code and make a pull request
02:48 - if you wanted to you can file issues if
02:51 - you notice things are wrong and in fact
02:52 - one of the ways that we actually figure
02:54 - out what to work on and what needs to be
02:56 - changed for future releases is by
02:58 - looking at this issues tab so a lot of
03:00 - the issues that are here will actually
03:02 - be posted by external contributors so
03:04 - those are people that are not a part of
03:06 - the Microsoft organization they come
03:08 - here and say hey I had an issue in vs
03:10 - code with the Python extension
03:12 - I need this fixed and they file an issue
03:14 - so let me just click on one here and
03:15 - just see what this says failed to
03:18 - activate Jupiter or create empty
03:19 - notebook so you can see that this goes
03:21 - through a whole whack of wow I didn't
03:23 - realize that was gonna be that long but
03:25 - just an issue that happened when this
03:27 - person was using our extension so you
03:29 - can see this is labeled data science
03:31 - type bug and it might be a part of a
03:33 - specific group or it might be organized
03:36 - in a certain way and that's kind of the
03:38 - way that we figure out what's wrong and
03:40 - what we need to work on and what new
03:41 - features people want if there's a issue
03:43 - that's come up a lot of times there a
03:45 - lot of people are up voting it then
03:47 - that's probably what we'll work on for
03:48 - the next release of vs code again I'm
03:51 - really just kind of a beginner here this
03:52 - is my basic understanding and the senior
03:54 - guys could definitely tell you more than
03:56 - I could but I think it's cool to
03:57 - understand that you can actually have a
03:59 - direct impact on what I potentially
04:01 - decide to work on and then the pull
04:03 - request tab is the next one I wanted to
04:05 - show you so this is actually how you go
04:07 - about making a change to this code so
04:10 - when you want to make a change what you
04:11 - do is you submit a pull request a pull
04:14 - request describes what you change it
04:15 - shows like why you changed it and what
04:18 - parts of the code you actually modified
04:20 - and then one of the senior developers on
04:22 - this team was write access to the
04:24 - repository will come look at
04:26 - do a review of it and then if it's a
04:28 - little good they'll give you a checkmark
04:29 - if it passes all our automated tests
04:32 - you'll get a check and then you can
04:33 - actually merge this right into the code
04:35 - base so you yourself can actually make a
04:38 - change to the vs code python extension
04:40 - assuming it's something that we want and
04:42 - you've done it properly so let me go
04:44 - here now to actually one of the changes
04:46 - that I've made to show you what I mean
04:48 - by a pull request so this was my I don't
04:51 - wanna say my first pull request maybe
04:52 - make my second or my third one and this
04:54 - was to save the variable Explorer height
04:56 - persistently that's not gonna mean much
04:58 - to you guys but there is a variable
05:00 - Explorer within vs code it was a not
05:02 - resizable before which meant it stayed
05:05 - as kind of a static window and it was
05:06 - really annoying because it was quite
05:08 - large so one of the first things I
05:09 - worked on was actually making that
05:11 - resizable and now making it so that it
05:14 - saves the height persistently so that
05:16 - when you come back into vias coder you
05:18 - open a file where you've resized that
05:19 - pane it remembers where you resized it
05:22 - so that you don't have to keep resizing
05:24 - it and keeps resetting so you can see I
05:26 - do a little description for what I
05:27 - changed I give my checks for the things
05:29 - that are appropriate and then you can
05:30 - look at all of the commits that I made
05:32 - so these are commit messages from github
05:34 - on my local machine I added a label
05:37 - called skip news some people who
05:39 - reviewed it requested some changes
05:41 - wanted me to modify something I made
05:43 - those changes so address the comments
05:44 - and then I got approved had two
05:46 - approvals here and then all the way down
05:49 - here I passed the code quality test I
05:51 - passed a bunch of other automated tests
05:54 - which I think we can see here other than
05:55 - one PR validation but that's not a big
05:57 - deal that's not important test and then
06:00 - I go went ahead and merged this into the
06:03 - master branch which means now this
06:04 - change is final and that everyone can
06:06 - see it that has the most recent version
06:08 - of this vs code Python extension so I
06:11 - think that's pretty cool that's how I
06:12 - changed it one cool thing to show you
06:14 - here is that if you go to checks or is
06:17 - it checks now sorry not checks check
06:19 - shows you all the automated tests that
06:21 - they have set up to make sure that
06:22 - nothing breaks when you make a change
06:23 - but if you go to files changed you can
06:25 - actually see all of the code that I
06:27 - wrote it's all highlighted in green and
06:29 - then anything that I deleted would be in
06:30 - red so like that or anything that I
06:32 - potentially moved around so anyways
06:34 - that's enough for this I want to
06:36 - actually show you what I work on on a
06:38 - day-to-day in terms of the
06:39 - code that I've been writing for the past
06:41 - week or two and I think that's pretty
06:43 - cool so let's go here
06:45 - and you can see that I've actually have
06:47 - open the Python vs code repository it's
06:50 - not a hundred percent up to date because
06:51 - I haven't merged the most recent changes
06:53 - or pulled the most recent changes but I
06:55 - have a few files open here one of which
06:57 - is export manager I'm currently working
06:59 - on this file and start writing this one
07:01 - from scratch and this is to actually
07:03 - export a Jupiter notebook to a PDF to
07:06 - HTML or to a Python script so we want to
07:10 - have that kind of functionality so
07:12 - that's a project that I've started it
07:13 - and then I'm gonna be tackling for this
07:15 - next few weeks anyways let me actually
07:18 - show you how we debug and kind of work
07:20 - in vs code to work on vs code because
07:24 - it's funny right I'm working on a vs
07:25 - code extension and I'm using vs code as
07:27 - my development environment so you can
07:30 - see that this is another instance of vs
07:32 - code that I have open here and it says
07:34 - extension development host what that
07:36 - means is this is kind of my debugging
07:38 - version of vs code this is one that I've
07:41 - built so there's a bunch of tasks
07:43 - running in the background here on vs
07:44 - code if I go to terminal they're
07:47 - automatically compiling all of my
07:49 - changes you can see eleven errors in
07:50 - this one that's great and serving them
07:53 - to this new vs code window so that I can
07:55 - actually test out anything that I've
07:57 - changed so the first feature that I
07:59 - worked on and this was kind of my like
08:00 - getting into the code base who's getting
08:02 - used to things was resizing this pane so
08:04 - make this resizable which by the way was
08:06 - a lot harder than it looks and then make
08:08 - it simple when you reopen it it stays
08:10 - the same size and if I save this file
08:12 - and reopen the file it saves the height
08:14 - that we have the variable Explorer at so
08:17 - that's the first change and the next
08:18 - thing I'm working at is this export as
08:20 - features so if you go on vs code right
08:23 - now and you click on this button that
08:25 - won't show up this is something that's
08:26 - just in my current code base right here
08:28 - and you can see a Python script HTML PDF
08:31 - and these are going to be the options
08:33 - that you have when you want to export
08:34 - something so let me make a change here
08:36 - and actually save this file so let's
08:38 - just save this as tester on my desktop
08:41 - let's make a change like that let's save
08:44 - and actually let's make another change
08:46 - so notice how it's unchanged I'm gonna
08:48 - go here and go HTML and then we get a
08:50 - little pop up down here
08:52 - please save this file before exporting
08:54 - save save and don't show again or cancel
08:57 - so that's something that I've implements
08:58 - as well as you know checking all this
09:00 - saving stuff so I'll hit save boom and
09:03 - now it's gonna ask me where I want to
09:04 - save my HTML and I can choose where I
09:06 - want it to go and then I haven't
09:08 - finished most of that feature yet but
09:09 - that's something that I'm working on so
09:11 - that is pretty much what I work on at
09:13 - Microsoft and on a day-to-day I could go
09:15 - in and show you way more but I wanted to
09:17 - keep this video kind of short and just
09:19 - give you guys a little insight into what
09:21 - I'm actually doing and see kind of how
09:23 - cool it actually is because I think it's
09:25 - really interesting that you guys can go
09:26 - and view all of the changes that I'm
09:28 - actually making that I can show you all
09:30 - of this stuff and that you actually get
09:32 - an idea that as an intern I'm writing
09:34 - real code and I'm working on a product
09:36 - and features that you guys are actually
09:38 - gonna be able to use and that you know
09:40 - millions of other people may be able to
09:42 - use in the future as well so without
09:44 - being said that has been this video I
09:46 - hope you guys enjoyed if you did make
09:48 - sure leave a like subscribe and I will
09:50 - see you all again in another YouTube
09:51 - video
