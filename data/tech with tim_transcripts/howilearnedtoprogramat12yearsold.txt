00:00 - hey guys and welcome back so in this
00:02 - video I'm gonna be talking to you about
00:03 - how I started to program and why I
00:05 - started at such a young age for some for
00:08 - those of you that don't know I started
00:10 - programming when I was 12 years old and
00:12 - I'm now 18 so I've been programming and
00:14 - a self-taught programmer for about six
00:16 - years and I'm gonna talk about how I
00:18 - started why I started and why I
00:20 - continually keep learning programming
00:22 - today alright so before I jump too far
00:31 - into the content I want to just quickly
00:32 - say that I am trying to kind of stick to
00:35 - a new upload schedule for tech with Tim
00:37 - and I'm trying to do a video like this
00:39 - each week where I kind of sit down talk
00:41 - to you guys a bit about myself some of
00:42 - my experiences maybe some tips and stuff
00:45 - along those lines so if you have any
00:46 - videos for sorry any ideas for videos
00:49 - like this please make sure you leave a
00:50 - comment down below but the rest of the
00:52 - upload schedule I'm gonna be posting one
00:54 - programming problem per week I really
00:56 - recommend if you guys are trying to
00:57 - learn to program or enhance your skills
00:59 - that you watch those videos because
01:00 - they're super valuable and I go through
01:03 - some pretty difficult problems and if
01:04 - you can solve them not only as rewarding
01:06 - for yourself but it does really improve
01:07 - your kind of ability in thinking skills
01:09 - that's why I do them personally for
01:10 - myself now for the next five days we're
01:13 - gonna be posting whatever is the kind of
01:14 - current series I'm on or just some kind
01:17 - of miniseries like I just did with that
01:18 - sudoko video which is just a two video
01:20 - series on like backtracking with sudoko
01:22 - so anyways that's what I'm trying to
01:24 - stick to quickly before we keep going if
01:26 - you guys want to chat with me outside of
01:27 - this please join my discord server or
01:29 - contact me on Twitter I'm always
01:31 - receiving messages from you guys and I
01:33 - love kind of engaging with you and
01:34 - answering your questions and comments so
01:36 - anyways let's get on with the video now
01:38 - I've always been one of those kids who's
01:40 - been super fascinated by how things work
01:43 - you probably know some people that just
01:45 - kind of accept the fact that something
01:47 - works but me personally um I will always
01:50 - be the person to question it not in like
01:53 - a conspiracy theory way but just in a
01:55 - like how does it actually work like
01:56 - curious I'm always trying to learn and I
01:58 - always want to know why something works
02:00 - so I can appreciate it on a deeper level
02:02 - now that's what I exactly what I did
02:05 - when I was younger as well I've always
02:07 - been like that
02:08 - you can ask anyone who's been friends
02:09 - with me or my parents especially when I
02:11 - was like 10 or 11 years old
02:13 - constantly just asking questions and
02:15 - trying to learn and as soon as I really
02:17 - got exposed to kind of computers and
02:19 - technology whether that be like my
02:20 - iPhone or just my own laptop or anything
02:23 - like that I've always been extremely
02:24 - curious on how these things worked to me
02:27 - like holding an iPod a certain on iphone
02:30 - when I was younger
02:31 - iPod and seeing like I can swipe back
02:33 - and forth I can click apps all for me
02:35 - like that was really cool that's just
02:37 - something that's really interesting and
02:39 - I wanted to take it to a new level and
02:41 - understand why it worked so when I was
02:43 - younger probably like 11 ish I'm in my
02:45 - free time which there was a lot of I'm
02:47 - only 11 I have no flecked
02:48 - responsibilities really was just looking
02:51 - up stuff like that just like how does it
02:52 - work how does a computer work how does a
02:54 - processor work
02:55 - what is coding like all this kind of
02:57 - stuff and just getting kind of a
02:58 - understanding of a lot of the things
03:00 - that happen around us now as I kind of
03:04 - looked up that stuff I eventually moved
03:06 - into randomly jailbreaking iPods now
03:10 - this is probably yeah like grade five or
03:12 - six like whenever the ipod touch was
03:14 - like the new cool thing and I would
03:16 - jailbreak my and my friend's iPods and
03:18 - we would get like new high scores on
03:20 - apps we get free stuff we download paid
03:22 - apps for free and it was just really
03:24 - cool and I would constantly run into the
03:26 - fact that I had to like edit code or
03:29 - modify like very slight lines of code
03:30 - and I had no idea what that code meant
03:32 - or what I was doing I was just like
03:34 - following a video so that kind of
03:35 - exposed me to the fact that like hey
03:37 - there's like thousands of lines of code
03:39 - underneath all of this stuff that I'm
03:41 - seeing on my screen and I was really
03:44 - interested on how this worked and why it
03:45 - worked and eventually it became like oh
03:48 - it's pretty convenient if I could like
03:49 - understand what this means and then I
03:51 - could like do way cooler things with the
03:54 - jailbreaking stuff I was doing so that's
03:56 - eventually what I ended up doing was
03:58 - trying to learn how this stuff worked
04:00 - and by the time that I was really
04:02 - getting into it jailbreaking was kind of
04:04 - it was kind of over by now everyone
04:05 - already either had a jailbroken iPod or
04:07 - just no one wanted to do it anymore so I
04:09 - started writing like VBS scripts now
04:12 - those are essentially they're like
04:13 - visual basic scripts and this is again
04:15 - yeah like when I'm like 12 and I
04:17 - download them on a USB and stick them
04:19 - into like the school computers and there
04:22 - wasn't very much security back then on
04:23 - the school computers or like I knew how
04:24 - to get around it so I could pretty well
04:26 - put
04:27 - on these computers so someone would like
04:28 - when they would login it would like boot
04:30 - up the script and say like hello and
04:32 - like just scare the crap out of them
04:33 - like that's what I did nothing harmful
04:35 - just like funny stuff on the computers
04:37 - so after doing kind of stuff like that I
04:39 - realized that programming was really
04:41 - cool and I barely even touched the
04:43 - surface I was like doing print
04:44 - statements right that's it I didn't even
04:46 - know what an if statement was so I
04:48 - looked up one day how to learn to
04:49 - program and then here comes the new
04:52 - Boston who by the way has an amazing
04:54 - channel if you're just starting out
04:55 - learning how to program I don't think
04:56 - he's on I don't think he's active on
04:58 - that anymore but it's still there videos
05:00 - that I watched still exists that were
05:02 - posted nine ten years ago but anyways so
05:04 - I learned HTML and I just thought that
05:07 - was like programming I didn't know what
05:09 - the different types of language is where
05:10 - I didn't know this was more of a markup
05:12 - language whatever right so I started
05:14 - learning HTML and I really enjoyed like
05:16 - creating stuff and being able to see
05:18 - like what I typed showing up on the
05:20 - screen and doing something and just
05:21 - working and then that led me into CSS
05:24 - and JavaScript and PHP now as soon as I
05:27 - hit JavaScript I knew immediately that
05:29 - the last thing I want to do with the
05:31 - rest of my life was program in HTML this
05:34 - is just really not fun
05:36 - I don't enjoy doing the the design
05:38 - aspect of anything I'm not very creative
05:40 - or artistic I don't know if I mentioned
05:41 - this yet and I really hated having to
05:44 - design stuff I just like making things
05:46 - work I like the function like when you
05:49 - clicked a button it would link to my
05:50 - JavaScript code and it would do this and
05:52 - this and I loved that kind of stuff so I
05:53 - started looking into things that were
05:55 - more like JavaScript that I could just
05:57 - use that kind of more back-end ish
05:59 - coding to do cooler things so eventually
06:02 - I don't really know how but I I felt
06:04 - learning c-sharp now I believe this was
06:06 - off a recommendation from one of my
06:08 - dad's colleagues who's in the tech field
06:10 - he's like a program or something like
06:11 - that and he said Oh C sharps a great
06:13 - language to learn first don't know if I
06:15 - would recommend c-sharp to a beginner
06:17 - anymore but anyways I learned that and
06:19 - did that for probably about two years so
06:21 - to give you a time frame now I'm
06:22 - probably like 14 or 15 years old like
06:25 - maybe in my first year of high school
06:27 - maybe great night now and I'm like
06:29 - getting pretty decent at c-sharp I'm
06:31 - doing programming problems online I'm
06:34 - watching videos like all I'm doing and
06:36 - all I've been doing for the past three
06:37 - years it's just in my spare time just
06:39 - learning
06:39 - programming like at least like three or
06:41 - four times a week like I'm going home
06:43 - and I'm watching videos I'm learning out
06:44 - a program and I'm absolutely loving it
06:46 - and I still do love it and the reason I
06:49 - loved it so much was because for me
06:51 - school and like my work which was school
06:54 - of that right was so not challenging and
06:57 - uninteresting that for me getting a
07:00 - challenge and learning something that I
07:02 - didn't already know or that was actually
07:04 - difficult which was programming for me
07:05 - which is so awesome and I could see like
07:08 - I try to do something I would fail and
07:09 - rather than like getting upset about it
07:11 - I'd be like alright looks like we got to
07:12 - sit here for another two hours and
07:13 - figure it out and that's always been how
07:15 - I've been like and what and that's why I
07:18 - love learning to program now and
07:19 - teaching stuff to you guys as well
07:20 - because I love being challenged and as
07:23 - soon as I don't know something it's just
07:25 - alright time to start learning it right
07:27 - it's not I give up it's like if I don't
07:28 - know it like alright I got to learn it
07:30 - not just the way that I've always been
07:32 - and that's why I really love programming
07:34 - and that's why it's really a massive
07:36 - mission for me especially to young
07:38 - people like under the age of 18 to
07:40 - expose them to programming because I
07:42 - know there's so many people out there
07:43 - like me they're living like a similar
07:45 - childhood or even just like me right now
07:47 - at 18 that have never been exposed to
07:49 - something as cool as programming and by
07:52 - exposing them to it then they're opening
07:54 - up a whole new world of possibilities
07:55 - and just something that they can find
07:57 - passion and really enjoy doing that's
08:00 - also why I teach it at a summer camp to
08:02 - kids that are aged like 11 to 15 because
08:05 - none that some of these kids like they
08:06 - will never be taught or even see this if
08:09 - someone like me doesn't teach it to them
08:11 - you know what I mean their parents are
08:12 - older maybe style and they don't they're
08:15 - not gonna introduce them to programming
08:17 - so unless they somehow search it up
08:19 - online when they're young they're
08:20 - missing out on a massive opportunity
08:22 - that being said obviously it's not for
08:24 - everyone
08:24 - but I really enjoy getting it out and
08:27 - seeing the people especially the
08:28 - comments on my channel like hey man I'm
08:29 - 15 I really enjoy your videos like
08:31 - you're an inspiration like that really
08:33 - just makes me feel amazing and that's
08:35 - why I continue every day with this
08:37 - channel so anyways that's kind of been
08:39 - it for this content if you guys enjoyed
08:40 - the video please make sure you leave a
08:41 - like and subscribe if you have any other
08:44 - ideas for videos like this please make
08:46 - sure you let me know in the comments
08:47 - down below
08:47 - I'm always responding and listening to
08:49 - comments and that would
