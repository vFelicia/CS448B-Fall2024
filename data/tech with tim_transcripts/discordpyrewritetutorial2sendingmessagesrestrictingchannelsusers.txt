00:00 - hey guys and welcome to the second video
00:02 - in my discord rewrite tutorials so today
00:05 - we're gonna be continuing where we left
00:06 - off with kind of sending messages adding
00:08 - some more commands we're gonna be
00:09 - talking about kind of getting specific
00:12 - things to a server like maybe how many
00:13 - members are on there who's online who's
00:15 - offline how we can check specific
00:17 - channels how we can check who is sending
00:20 - what message how we can mention members
00:21 - kind of going through a lot of the basic
00:24 - stuff but this will allow you to
00:25 - actually create a lot now before I
00:27 - continue what I want to talk about just
00:29 - is all this stuff is gonna be on my
00:31 - website so if you guys are like
00:32 - struggling with any of the code or you
00:34 - can't keep up with the pace that I'm
00:35 - going at just go to my website tech with
00:37 - tim ned go to this tutorials page you
00:39 - can just do that by clicking up here go
00:41 - to the discord bot section and then at
00:44 - the time of recording the side of the
00:46 - text-based version dumb-butt you'll be
00:48 - able to click on the text-based tutorial
00:49 - most likely right when this comes out so
00:52 - i'll show you for example with the first
00:53 - tutorial it was already out and you can
00:55 - kind of go through here and it explains
00:57 - everything that I'm doing the video just
00:58 - kind of like not as detailed and then
01:01 - they have I have all the code here that
01:02 - you can kind of copy as well if you run
01:04 - into any errors so I'm also just gonna
01:07 - talk about so what I do essentially when
01:08 - I teach these tutorials and what I
01:10 - learned is I just read the documentation
01:11 - so essentially what I did to learn
01:13 - rewrite is I just read through this
01:15 - entire documentation and then I kind of
01:17 - picked through the stuff that I think is
01:18 - important and that's not like super
01:21 - specific to a use case and then I teach
01:23 - that as like I don't know that that's
01:25 - just what I do right so you'll see me
01:27 - occasionally look over to my other
01:28 - screen because I just have the
01:29 - documentation open cuz I don't memorize
01:31 - this stuff I just look through and know
01:33 - how to use it so if you guys want to
01:34 - learn how to do a bunch of this stuff
01:36 - that I maybe don't talk about cuz look
01:38 - there's tons of stuff in here that you
01:39 - can do like I can't even begin to
01:41 - explain how powerful this module is just
01:43 - go to this link I leave it in the
01:44 - description and read through the
01:46 - documentation yourself now it's not
01:47 - gonna be as easy to do things as
01:49 - compared to watching me because I've
01:50 - already read through it and kind of show
01:52 - what's difficult and what's not but you
01:55 - can learn how to like maybe if you want
01:56 - to do sound and I don't talk about that
01:57 - till video 5 then you can read through
01:59 - this and maybe try to figure that out
02:01 - for yourself
02:02 - so essentially what we want to do in
02:04 - this tutorial is I already was playing
02:05 - around with the button here just to make
02:06 - sure everything's working but we want to
02:09 - get the server ID first now what we were
02:12 - doing the last video is we just
02:13 - I bought and it's on this server right
02:15 - but it could be on any server that we
02:17 - want and that means when we run the bot
02:19 - on any server it'll do the same thing
02:21 - now that's good in some cases but in
02:24 - other cases we need specific information
02:26 - to the server we're on for example the
02:28 - amount of members well that's going to
02:29 - be specific to the server so we need
02:31 - some way to access that value so to do
02:34 - that we actually need to get something
02:35 - called the server ID now to get that is
02:38 - well it's not challenging but it's not
02:40 - easy either so what I need you to do
02:41 - first of all let's go to your discord go
02:43 - to user settings not not like channel
02:45 - settings user settings and then you're
02:47 - gonna go to appearance and you're gonna
02:49 - scroll down to where you see developer
02:51 - mode now mine is already on but yours
02:54 - will most likely be off so you're gonna
02:56 - have to turn this on and even says your
02:58 - developer mode exposes context menu
03:00 - items helpful for people writing BOTS
03:02 - which is exactly what we're doing
03:03 - so we'll do that and then what we're
03:06 - gonna do is we're gonna go to our test
03:07 - server or whatever server you're working
03:08 - and obviously go to server settings and
03:10 - go to widget now if you clicked on
03:13 - widget before you might not have seen
03:14 - this page I can't promise you you did or
03:17 - not because I have like streamer mode
03:18 - enabled at some point so it's kind of
03:19 - weird but anyways you're gonna copy this
03:21 - value that's a server ID okay I don't
03:24 - think it's I don't think it matters if
03:25 - you guys know what my server ideas but
03:27 - anyways there you go so copy the server
03:30 - ID and now what we're gonna do is I'll
03:32 - just what do you call it exit out of
03:34 - this and I've already got a copied here
03:36 - but just copy it in so you have the
03:39 - server ID okay and what we're gonna do
03:41 - now is we're gonna type exactly this I
03:43 - figure out that I still have this typed
03:44 - rent type ID equals client don't get
03:48 - underscore guild and then that ID value
03:50 - which is you got exactly from the
03:52 - discord page right now we have a
03:54 - reference to our specific server so we
03:56 - can do things like count the amount of
03:58 - members so once you've done that what
04:01 - I'm gonna do now is going to add another
04:02 - command that's just gonna simply print
04:03 - out at the amount of members that are in
04:05 - our discord server so to do this we'll
04:07 - say L if message dot content equals
04:12 - equals and then in this case let's say
04:14 - users right and then this will just give
04:17 - us the amount of users or members in our
04:18 - server and obviously play with these if
04:21 - you want these to be something else you
04:22 - can make this like a - like you can do
04:24 - whatever command thing and you can even
04:25 - make it like that it doesn't
04:26 - to be with an exclamation point I'm just
04:28 - choosing to use that for my commands so
04:30 - now we're just going to await message
04:32 - dot channel dot send and then in here
04:36 - I'm actually going to use something
04:37 - called an F string so I'm gonna type F
04:39 - and then I'm gonna do three quotation
04:41 - marks and you can use this in regular
04:42 - Python as well but what we're gonna do
04:44 - now is I'm just gonna say we call it
04:48 - number of members and we're gonna put
04:52 - these little curly braces now you won't
04:54 - see these curly braces when you print
04:56 - it's just to declare that we're about to
04:57 - place a variable in here so that way we
04:59 - don't have to add like the pluses and
05:01 - the commas and do all that formatting
05:03 - for the string we can just kind of type
05:04 - it directly in which is really nice so
05:06 - we'll put these curly braces and then in
05:08 - here we're gonna do is gonna do ID dot
05:09 - member underscore count and since this
05:12 - is a reference to our server and by the
05:14 - way ID if this is giving you errors just
05:15 - change it to something else because it's
05:16 - a Python keyword but it should be fine
05:18 - and then we'll do member underscore
05:20 - count and they'll give us how many
05:21 - members are in our server so let's run
05:23 - this and see if I made any mistakes or
05:25 - not and now we're just gonna go I'm in
05:27 - the general thing here so we'll type
05:28 - users and you can see the number of
05:31 - members and it gives us the value of two
05:32 - because obviously we have our bought
05:34 - user and then Tim so sweet if we wanted
05:37 - we could add cool in here too cuz that
05:38 - is probably gonna annoy me all right so
05:40 - now we've got that so now how can we
05:43 - check what channel a users sending
05:45 - messages into for example in my my
05:48 - actual discord server so like tech with
05:50 - Tim here I only allow users to send like
05:53 - bought commands in the bought commands
05:55 - channel or the commands channel
05:56 - obviously they can still type this in
05:58 - other channels but if they do nothing's
06:00 - gonna happen so how can we do that so
06:02 - for example I only want to be able to
06:03 - send it in what one or two channels so
06:05 - Bach commands commands maybe mod so how
06:09 - can we choose those channels well first
06:10 - we're gonna have to actually say let me
06:12 - go back here to test server I need to
06:14 - create a new channel you're gonna call
06:16 - this commands okay and you can see it's
06:18 - a blank Channel you can add as many as
06:20 - you want if you want to play with
06:20 - multiple ones but essentially what we're
06:22 - gonna do is I'm gonna make a list of
06:23 - valid channels so I'm just gonna say it
06:25 - channels yeah
06:27 - channels equals hope that's not gonna
06:30 - give us any airs with anything okay
06:32 - channels equals and then we'll do
06:34 - commands now if you had another channel
06:38 - that you wanted to be able to send in
06:39 - here you do
06:40 - like maybe admin and you just type out
06:42 - the exact name and if it has a - like
06:44 - add the - you don't need the pound sign
06:46 - though you just need this okay and now
06:48 - what we'll do is before we send a bot
06:51 - reply we'll make sure that we're in a
06:52 - correct channel so what we could do is
06:54 - we can say if message dot channel
06:57 - because equals channels work not equals
07:00 - equals sorry in channels which
07:03 - essentially is just gonna check if it's
07:04 - either commands or anything else that's
07:06 - in this list will tab all this in and
07:08 - there we go so that should be working
07:11 - now I'm also just gonna throw a string
07:13 - around here I don't know if this will
07:14 - cause an error or not but I just want to
07:15 - be safe with her string and now let's
07:17 - just test this and see if everything's
07:19 - working so we're gonna discord we'll go
07:21 - to general and let's type hello and
07:25 - nothing's happening okay but that is I
07:27 - believe a command so now if I go here
07:29 - and I type below you can see that the
07:31 - bot responds with hi and if I do
07:33 - something like users it also responds
07:35 - with number of members to again if I try
07:37 - users in here it doesn't work because
07:40 - we're not in the correct channel so
07:42 - that's a really useful way to do things
07:43 - okay so the next thing I'm gonna do is
07:46 - I'm going to show you a new event and
07:47 - this is if a member joins so if a member
07:50 - joins your server likely you'd want to
07:52 - greet them you want to say hey welcome
07:53 - to the server and you want some
07:54 - personalized message that probably
07:56 - involves their name so to do this we're
07:58 - gonna do another client event decorator
08:00 - so I'll copy that and the the event this
08:03 - time is gonna be async so the same as
08:05 - before
08:06 - define on underscore member underscore
08:10 - join and this takes one parameter and I
08:13 - believe the parameter is member and yes
08:16 - awesome so member okay so what we're
08:19 - gonna do now is we're gonna mention this
08:21 - member in a message and we're gonna send
08:23 - it in a channel now the thing is though
08:25 - since this is only giving us the member
08:27 - of the joint is not giving us the
08:28 - channel they joined in we have to know
08:31 - what channel to uh
08:32 - to welcome them in so essentially 99% of
08:36 - you are probably gonna have all your
08:37 - members join through the general channel
08:39 - so that's probably gonna be the channel
08:40 - you want a message it right but for
08:42 - example if they were joining in the
08:44 - channel like I don't know like and you
08:47 - renamed it something else that wasn't
08:48 - general then you'd have to change what
08:51 - you're about to do here and I'll show
08:52 - you in one second I'm just gonna look at
08:54 - this okay so now what I'm gonna do is
08:56 - I'm just gonna make a folder I'm gonna
08:58 - say for channel in member dot server
09:03 - yes server dot channels and what this is
09:07 - gonna do is it's gonna get all of the
09:08 - channels that is in the server that the
09:11 - member joined okay so similar to kind of
09:13 - getting this guild we're just doing it
09:15 - in a different way and now we're gonna
09:17 - say if channel equals equals and then
09:21 - whatever the name of your what do you
09:24 - call it channel is and again I'll put
09:25 - string here I don't know if we need to
09:26 - do this but this is the way I did in my
09:28 - other code so we'll just use this for
09:30 - now so string channel equals equals
09:31 - general and this will mean we're only
09:33 - gonna send a message if it's in the
09:35 - general channel and now what we'll do is
09:37 - we'll say oh wait and then we'll do
09:39 - member server dot channels how should we
09:46 - do this or no I think it's like this
09:48 - client dot send should be something like
09:52 - this and then we can just say send
09:54 - underscore message there and then what
09:57 - we'll do is we'll we'll send like
09:59 - welcome to the server okay
10:01 - so I think I'm trying to understand what
10:03 - I did here I think this this works if
10:05 - channel equals general then we'll just
10:07 - send a message cuz we're in that channel
10:08 - that that should that makes sense to me
10:10 - but I sorry I'm having trouble to
10:12 - explain that so let you do another F
10:13 - string and then in here what we can do
10:16 - is well we got to add these other
10:17 - quotation marks I believe where's my
10:20 - quotation marks there we go and we'll
10:22 - just say welcome to the server and then
10:26 - in here we can say member dot mention
10:29 - and what this is going to do is it's
10:32 - gonna do that little at sign and it's
10:33 - going to like mention them so they get
10:35 - like a notification saying like welcome
10:37 - to the the server
10:38 - okay so testing this out will be
10:41 - interesting because I'm gonna have to
10:42 - either invite like another bot or
10:45 - something and see if that works
10:47 - okay you know what maybe we'll test this
10:49 - in another video but just just trust me
10:51 - on this one if it's working or you guys
10:52 - can you guys can tell me if it works or
10:53 - not and then I can tweak it in the next
10:56 - video alright but I'm pretty sure this
10:57 - should work for if a new member joins
10:59 - the server and I had it working on my
11:01 - sir
11:01 - I believe so you'll see that should work
11:03 - okay so what else could we possibly want
11:06 - to do okay so we figured out how we can
11:08 - get the channel you're sending it in but
11:10 - how about who's sending what like what
11:12 - if I only want myself to be able to use
11:14 - the bots well we can do that as well so
11:18 - we can say something like valid
11:19 - underscore user just equals two and then
11:22 - I look at a list and I'm gonna put my
11:24 - little tag in here nine to nine eight
11:28 - I think is my number and you do need
11:31 - this actual number sign otherwise this
11:32 - isn't gonna work so what I can do now is
11:34 - I can actually say and so we have this
11:37 - condition so if it's in the correct
11:39 - channel and the member is invalid users
11:41 - so to do this we'll say if the message
11:43 - dot author in and then again valid
11:49 - underscore users and one more time we'll
11:51 - convert this to string I don't know
11:52 - again if you have to do this you can
11:54 - play around without the string but let's
11:55 - see now if I get I guess we can't even
11:58 - test this anyways but anyways let's try
12:00 - this because I'm the only member in the
12:01 - server but let's do I don't know go to
12:05 - the correct channel unless type hello
12:07 - and see if it actually works there we go
12:08 - so high okay so now I want to see let's
12:11 - change this to a different name let's
12:13 - get rid of Tim and let's let's make it
12:14 - tea I just so it's easy to change back
12:16 - and now let's run this and see if it's
12:17 - still letting me send messages or not so
12:20 - now we're in the correct channel we say
12:21 - hello and nothing's happening it's not
12:23 - letting us send anything back so that
12:26 - was actually working correctly and this
12:27 - is how you can make like a list of valid
12:29 - users now you can also do this like
12:32 - based on rule like you can say if user
12:34 - dot role equals equals mod allow them to
12:36 - do this and I will go through that later
12:39 - but it's in the documentation where is
12:41 - it here if you want to look at how you
12:42 - can get roles and stuff it's somewhere
12:45 - you if you just look like roles then it
12:49 - should go through like all the different
12:50 - things on how to get that so changelog
12:52 - chain like you can read through that
12:54 - anyways okay so let's do this though so
12:57 - let's say you send a message and it
13:00 - doesn't let you are you in the wrong
13:01 - channel or you're not a valid user maybe
13:04 - you want to say something back to the
13:05 - user or maybe want to print something
13:07 - into the console so maybe we'll say like
13:08 - print and then we'll do another F string
13:11 - because these are just useful I'll say
13:15 - user and then whatever that username was
13:19 - so we'll say like message all thing
13:22 - tried to do command and then we'll put
13:28 - in here whatever that command was so
13:30 - message dot content so now we were doing
13:34 - is actually we're not gonna show
13:35 - anything to the user but we're gonna
13:36 - print to this log screen saying like
13:39 - this user was trying to do a command and
13:41 - we can just print that out so we can see
13:43 - what they're trying to do essentially
13:44 - right so let's break this let's change
13:47 - this so that it's actually gonna work
13:48 - because I am a valid user right now and
13:49 - we'll do this so we'll run and then
13:52 - we'll go here and we'll say like hello
13:56 - okay so now we come here and it says
13:58 - user Tim nine - nine eight tried to do
14:00 - command hello now we can also say what
14:02 - Chan will be tried to do it in so let's
14:04 - say in Channel and then again we can do
14:07 - message Channel and now we're have
14:11 - essentially like a log going within our
14:13 - command prompt here within our console
14:16 - so if I break this run this again and
14:19 - then do this one more time because the
14:21 - the channel would probably be useful so
14:22 - we'll do a whole load and then we'll
14:25 - just do another one in here and I'll say
14:27 - users then you can see Tim try to do
14:31 - command hello in channel commands Tim
14:34 - try to do command exclamation point
14:35 - users in channel general now the thing
14:38 - is right if I type anything it's still
14:41 - just gonna say that it's still gonna say
14:43 - what I tried to do and what think so
14:45 - watch this like if I just type hi it's
14:47 - gonna say I try to do the command hi
14:48 - even though it's not command and that's
14:50 - just because the way we have this if
14:51 - statement setup is we're only checking
14:53 - these things if they're valid user and
14:55 - this else statement right is only
14:57 - triggering if they're not avail user
14:58 - they're in the wrong channel so
15:00 - essentially that's what's gonna end up
15:01 - happening but I think I showed you guys
15:02 - enough to kind of get a grasp on how to
15:05 - do some stuff here to add your own
15:06 - commands do you send stuff back you can
15:08 - get the member account message content
15:10 - next video we're gonna do a lot more
15:12 - we're gonna get into like changing roles
15:13 - and nicknames and like all that fun
15:15 - stuff
15:16 - some more powerful things but I just
15:18 - wanted to give you guys kind of a
15:19 - beginning here again if you have any
15:20 - questions please join my discord tech
15:23 - with Tim you guys can see here if I go
15:25 - like - all these help channels like
15:26 - everyone's
15:27 - really helpful me go through and kind of
15:28 - help people with code and whatnot so I'm
15:30 - sure you'll be more than happy to help
15:32 - you I would as well follow me on Twitter
15:34 - and I will see you guys in the next
15:35 - video
15:36 - [Music]
