00:00 - hey guys welcome back to another YouTube
00:02 - video today's video I'm just gonna be
00:04 - giving a little guide on what you need
00:06 - to buy if you're trying to mine a
00:07 - theorem and how you can make an ax
00:09 - theory and mining rig so I'm just going
00:11 - to go through all the different
00:12 - components that you're going to need to
00:13 - purchase and how you can set them up and
00:15 - then I'm also just going to show you
00:16 - kind of what I started off doing so that
00:19 - you can get an idea all right so my
00:21 - first mining rig I'm going to put a
00:22 - picture up here on the screen right now
00:31 - you
00:52 - I only had two graphics cards and I was
00:54 - mining at about 40 mega hash per second
00:57 - which I mean isn't that much but just
00:58 - for starting out is what I want to do so
01:01 - now I'm gonna be showing you a video I
01:03 - wish I had watched before I kind of set
01:05 - up this mining rig so I could have saved
01:06 - a bit of money and I also could have
01:08 - just had a better mining rig in general
01:10 - all right so let's get started right
01:11 - away with the hardware so we're gonna
01:14 - need obviously everything that you need
01:15 - in a computer and the first thing is the
01:17 - motherboard so I mean the motherboard as
01:20 - much as it is important it's really not
01:23 - a lot important pretty much any h-series
01:26 - motherboard will do as long as it has
01:27 - the right socket here so LGA 1151 and
01:30 - then it supports ddr4 really you're just
01:32 - looking for one of the cheapest ones
01:34 - that you can get and the important thing
01:35 - here is to look at the amount of PCI
01:37 - slots it has so you can see here it has
01:40 - one two three four five six PCI slots
01:43 - which is great which means we have room
01:44 - for expansion in the future or we can
01:46 - support up to six graphics cards there
01:48 - are some other boards that support a lot
01:51 - more PCI slots so they have like 10 or
01:53 - 12 like ridiculous amounts like that but
01:55 - if you're just starting out you don't
01:56 - really need them any PCI slots okay so
01:58 - that's the first thing to look for when
02:00 - you're getting a motherboard pretty much
02:01 - the socket the RAM and then the amount
02:04 - of PCI slots so the amount of PCI slots
02:06 - is definitely the most important and
02:07 - then the next thing we're gonna look for
02:09 - is a processor really here I just picked
02:12 - up the cheapest Intel Celeron processor
02:14 - I could find it's a 2 core processor
02:16 - does the job I mean you don't really
02:18 - need anything super great as long as it
02:21 - supports the amount of PCI lanes then
02:23 - you're good to go so pretty much any
02:25 - Intel Celeron processor if we're gonna
02:27 - be using this board so LGA 1151 then we
02:30 - need a 6 gen or a 7th gen processor
02:32 - alright the next thing stick a ram
02:35 - really I just picked out the cheapest
02:37 - Ram I could find on Amazon right now
02:38 - this one's forty seven dollars just for
02:40 - a four gig stick you don't need anything
02:42 - more than 4 gigs because of what's gonna
02:44 - be doing the power for your computer is
02:45 - the graphics cards alright so that's
02:48 - pretty much it for Ram graphics card so
02:51 - this is definitely the most important
02:52 - decision you're gonna make
02:53 - when you're getting an aetherium mining
02:55 - rig now depending on your budget and on
02:58 - how many graphics cards you want this
02:59 - decision may be different so this is the
03:02 - one that I recommend here especially if
03:04 - you're trying to go for a mid-level
03:05 - the high range mining rig you're gonna
03:07 - want to get a gtx 1070 that's my
03:10 - personal opinion it's the best bang for
03:12 - your buck in terms of hash rate and you
03:14 - can go check out my other video which
03:16 - I'll put a link up to now on the best
03:18 - GPUs for mining aetherium at the current
03:20 - time of 2017 and that relates to the dag
03:23 - size and how well they're hashing right
03:26 - now so this card I think if I can recall
03:28 - gut gets about 29 to 30 mega hash per
03:30 - second and if you overclock using one of
03:32 - the guides I have in my channel you can
03:34 - get even more and it isn't too
03:36 - unaffordable either at $550 so you can
03:39 - get a few of those to add into your
03:40 - mining rig alright now the next
03:42 - important decision is the power supply
03:44 - so depending on how many graphics cards
03:47 - you're buying this may vary now if
03:50 - you're going for four or five cards
03:51 - especially with the gtx 1070 and a
03:54 - thousand watt power supply will be fine
03:55 - for you but if you're going up to six
03:57 - cards you may want to move up to a 1200
03:59 - watt power supply now this is just
04:01 - because the a thousand watt will power
04:03 - your system if you have six cards but
04:05 - it's going to be not at its peak
04:07 - performance and you're gonna it's not
04:08 - going to be as efficient as if you had
04:11 - per say a 1200 watt power supply and
04:15 - another thing to look at here when we
04:16 - look at the power supplies is the rating
04:18 - on it so you're always gonna want to
04:20 - look for an 80 plus rating on your power
04:22 - supply and also gold certification or
04:24 - platinum certification now that just
04:27 - tells you the efficiency of the power
04:28 - supply and can save you a lot of money
04:31 - on electricity costs if you go from say
04:33 - a bronze rated power supply to a gold
04:35 - rated power supply and this one here has
04:37 - all your necessary cables you're gonna
04:39 - want to make sure since this one is
04:40 - modular as well it's gonna have enough
04:42 - cables to power your graphics cards that
04:45 - you get here and just check the you pin
04:47 - connector on the graphics card in this
04:48 - case and it's an 8 pin connector so you
04:50 - can see that that one will be sufficient
04:52 - to power four or five of these cards all
04:55 - right now the next one this step is
04:57 - really not that important you just need
04:59 - any hard drive pretty much that you can
05:00 - download windows on to or if you're
05:02 - using fos or any of those other mining
05:06 - os's that exists or even Linux
05:08 - pretty much I just found a random power
05:10 - supply and Amazon cheapest one I could
05:12 - find 60 gigs one terabyte if you really
05:14 - want your system to run fast and boot up
05:16 - really quickly you can get an SSD but
05:18 - that's really
05:19 - not necessary and now this step here so
05:22 - a lot of people don't really realize
05:24 - that you can't just plug in six graphics
05:27 - cards into your motherboard so like here
05:29 - you can't actually just put them all
05:30 - into the slots like that
05:32 - you need to get PCI risers especially if
05:34 - you have a ton of different graphics
05:36 - cards you can see this only has two
05:37 - full-sized slots where you could plug 2
05:40 - into there but it's at the point where
05:41 - it could be a fire hazard and a safety
05:43 - hazard if you have too many of them on
05:45 - your motherboard so show you if you saw
05:47 - my mining rig how the graphics cards
05:49 - were actually suspended they were above
05:51 - the motherboard and one of them was
05:53 - attached using this PCI riser right here
05:55 - so depending on how many graphics cards
05:57 - you get it's gonna depend on how many
05:59 - PCI risers you get in this case I just
06:01 - found a six pack on Amazon for 50 bucks
06:02 - it's a pretty good deal I just bought
06:04 - one of them when I did it I think it was
06:05 - like fourteen fifteen dollars and these
06:08 - are really important and you can plug
06:09 - them into the slots so that you can rise
06:12 - they're powered by the way--by SATA
06:14 - cable as you can see here in the picture
06:16 - on these SATA power right there and yeah
06:20 - so these are very important and this is
06:22 - what you're gonna plug your graphics
06:23 - card into now also an important thing to
06:25 - realize is that you can actually plug
06:27 - these into not just the PCI Express
06:28 - slots but the full-length PCI slots so
06:32 - if we look on the motherboard here you
06:33 - can see there's a smaller slots there
06:35 - and then there's the longer slots these
06:36 - will actually plug into both of them so
06:38 - you can use these on the full-size PCI
06:41 - slots and that's something to note as
06:42 - well um so yeah that's pretty much been
06:45 - my guide for what hardware you need to
06:48 - buy for a theory of mining again if
06:51 - you're just starting off small I
06:52 - wouldn't recommend getting too many
06:53 - cards if you just want to get a feel for
06:55 - it maybe get one card to card whatever
06:57 - you think you can afford and you can go
06:58 - ahead and calculate how much money
07:00 - you're gonna make if you just go to I
07:02 - think about you should look it up
07:04 - aetherium mining profitability
07:07 - calculator just like that and then you
07:10 - can plug in your hash rate and power
07:13 - consumption and you can just calculate
07:14 - how much you're gonna make per year per
07:16 - month per day etc on there so you can
07:19 - see how much profit you're actually
07:20 - going to gain and the payback period on
07:21 - each of these cards if you want to learn
07:23 - more about graphics cards and the best
07:25 - ones for theory and mining go ahead and
07:27 - check out the video on my channel for
07:29 - best GPUs remaining aetherium and say
07:31 - you already have mining
07:32 - rig and you want to overclock your cards
07:34 - I also have a guide on how to do that
07:35 - for both AMD and NVIDIA cards on my
07:39 - channel so that's been at for this
07:40 - hardware guide all the links to these
07:42 - parts are in the description below if
