00:00 - there's really good programmers the
00:02 - reason why they can oftentimes get a ton
00:03 - of stuff done is because they spend the
00:05 - time up front to automate set up their
00:08 - environment and make themselves as
00:09 - efficient as humanly possible now when I
00:12 - say automation this can be stuff like
00:13 - setting up your environment so that you
00:15 - know all of your keyboard shortcuts it
00:17 - could be automating testing or
00:19 - automating deployments or automating
00:21 - just like setting up a certain folder
00:23 - structure or different files in your
00:25 - code base the general idea here is that
00:27 - all of these really good programmers
00:28 - that I've seen don't waste time doing
00:30 - repetitive stuff they're programmers
00:32 - after all and they always like to
00:34 - automate pretty much everything they
00:36 - possibly can so they can spend a
00:38 - majority of their time writing code or
00:40 - writing tests or whatever it is they
00:41 - need to do rather than performing these
00:43 - kind of monotonous and repetitive tasks
