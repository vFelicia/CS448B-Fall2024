00:00 - now I'm guilty of this as well but most
00:02 - people and especially younger
00:03 - programmers at least from what I can see
00:05 - is write crazy convoluted methods and
00:07 - just ways of doing things that are super
00:09 - Advanced to try to show what they know
00:11 - or to try to prove that they're smarter
00:13 - than other people go ahead if you want
00:15 - to do this but it just is such a
00:16 - headache in the future when maybe you
00:18 - haven't programmed in a month or you
00:19 - haven't looked at this code in a while
00:21 - and you come back and you're adding a
00:22 - new feature and you run into a bug and
00:23 - then you realize maybe that bug is from
00:25 - something you wrote before you go back
00:27 - and you try to read these methods and
00:28 - you're like holy crap what was I doing
00:30 - whereas if you had just added you know
00:32 - two or three lines simplified things a
00:34 - bit made them a bit more readable this
00:35 - would have saved you a tremendous amount
00:37 - of time so just keep things simple to
00:38 - start
