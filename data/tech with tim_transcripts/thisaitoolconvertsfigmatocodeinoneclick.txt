00:00 - if you've ever worked on some kind of
00:01 - Dev team or built out an app or website
00:03 - really anything us are facing chances
00:05 - are you've worked with a designer and
00:07 - they've built everything out in
00:08 - something like figma they then hand you
00:11 - the design and they say okay you're on
00:12 - your own now go ahead and code this out
00:15 - now this always seemed a little bit
00:16 - backwards and broken to me we've already
00:18 - got the entire app it looks great it
00:20 - works in figma it's well structured and
00:23 - now all of a sudden I need to remake the
00:25 - entire thing and worst case now
00:27 - something changes in the design I got to
00:28 - figure out what that Chang ches and go
00:30 - in the code and do it manually now this
00:33 - is really inefficient and fortunately we
00:35 - now have some awesome AI tools that can
00:37 - actually do all of this for you now you
00:39 - may have seen my previous video on a
00:41 - gamechanging AI tool called loc ai. a
00:45 - that is a design to code tool that could
00:46 - convert any figma file into highquality
00:49 - front-end code in just a few steps now
00:52 - today I'm teaming up with them to share
00:53 - with you their latest product which is
00:55 - locy lightning which is even better than
00:57 - the last one and can do all of this in a
00:59 - a single step that's right one step you
01:02 - can take an entire figma document and
01:04 - convert that into highquality readable
01:07 - reusable front-end code it really is
01:10 - absolutely game-changing best part it's
01:12 - completely free and I'm going to show
01:14 - you a quick demo here of exactly how it
01:16 - works now this tool is powered by
01:17 - something called Loco AI which leverages
01:20 - their in-house large design models which
01:22 - are trained on millions of designs and
01:24 - applications now this really is the
01:26 - future of front-end development and the
01:28 - best part is that this is all available
01:30 - inside of figma Dev mode this is a new
01:33 - workspace that helps you transition from
01:34 - design to code faster with figma Dev
01:37 - mode you can easily inspect designs view
01:40 - code from design components compare
01:42 - changes export assets and more Dev mode
01:45 - also works seamlessly inigma for vs code
01:47 - which I'll get into later in this video
01:50 - so to get started with locy lightning
01:52 - what we'll need to do is toggle Dev mode
01:54 - in figma so we can go to this button up
01:56 - here in the top right hand corner this
01:58 - will enable Dev mode and we we should
02:00 - now see a plugins tab if you're not
02:02 - seeing that you can go to the left hand
02:03 - side here and you can go to plugins and
02:07 - then click on manage plugins from here
02:10 - we'll simply search for locy which you
02:13 - can see that if I can type correctly is
02:15 - already here and now it will load up the
02:17 - locy plugin from here what we're able to
02:20 - do is actually generate all of the code
02:23 - for our Figi by simply clicking a single
02:26 - button so first we'll select a few
02:28 - settings for the type of code that we
02:29 - want so you can see we have some options
02:31 - react HTML CSS nextjs view Etc and then
02:35 - we can go here and select if we want
02:37 - typescript JavaScript Tailwind pixels
02:40 - REM you get the idea and later on if you
02:42 - change your mind you can actually adjust
02:44 - this and the code will be regenerated
02:46 - for you so I'm going to click on apply
02:48 - and then on let's go from here we'll
02:50 - select all of the frames we can do that
02:52 - by holding shift and just selecting the
02:54 - ones that we want and then we can go
02:55 - ahead and convert these four frames now
02:58 - at this point what Loco AI will do is
03:00 - actually optimize our design by making
03:02 - it responsive using things like Auto
03:04 - layout and then it will tag interactive
03:07 - elements like buttons inputs Etc as well
03:10 - as creating different reusable
03:12 - components and automatically suggesting
03:14 - layer and class names to make our code
03:16 - more reusable and clean this is pretty
03:19 - incredible that with a single button
03:21 - click obviously once we've selected our
03:22 - options here we can generate all of the
03:25 - different code and Loco AI handles all
03:27 - of this for us now this differs from the
03:29 - previous version of locy where there's a
03:31 - few steps that you need to run through
03:33 - here the Loco AI takes care of all of it
03:35 - and you can see at this point that now
03:37 - we've generated the code and we can
03:39 - actually go ahead and view an
03:41 - interactive preview as well as the code
03:43 - so let's make this a little bit larger
03:45 - here okay so expand this on the left
03:47 - side we'll expand this demo and let's
03:50 - just zoom in a bit so we can actually
03:52 - see it and you'll notice that I can
03:53 - click on the different interactable
03:55 - elements so these were tagged by local
03:57 - AI as interactable elements I can go in
03:59 - choose different options press on the
04:01 - buttons I can even view different
04:03 - responsive views here so if we make this
04:05 - a bit smaller you'll see that as I click
04:07 - through we can view what it looks like
04:08 - on large screens small screens Etc to
04:11 - make sure it's nice and responsive and
04:13 - now if we uncollapse this and continue
04:15 - to scroll down here you'll see that we
04:17 - can actually view all of the code and
04:18 - the components that Loco AI created so
04:21 - let me expand the code here and you'll
04:23 - see if we click through the different
04:25 - pages so details sign up Etc we get all
04:28 - of the code we get the components that
04:30 - were created and Loco AI has created
04:33 - Pixel Perfect components for all of the
04:35 - different pages that are involved in our
04:37 - application so now at this point that
04:39 - we've got the code there's a few options
04:41 - here we can copy the code just by
04:43 - pressing this button we can download it
04:45 - and modify it directly or we can move
04:47 - further and talk about something known
04:49 - as the Builder so if I click on continue
04:51 - and Builder what we're able to do here
04:54 - is actually sync our code with the locy
04:56 - builder which allows us to view the
04:58 - generated components we we can actually
05:00 - bind Dynamic data and then we can export
05:02 - the code and sync it with things like
05:04 - GitHub this is pretty cool and it gives
05:06 - us quite a few options and allows us to
05:08 - really customize this generated code
05:10 - before we bring it into something like
05:12 - our IDE so we have a few options here
05:14 - first thing we'll need to do is
05:15 - obviously connect to our locy account
05:17 - which we probably already would have
05:18 - done and now what we can do is create a
05:20 - new project so I'm just going to call
05:23 - this locy with Tim like that we can
05:28 - choose any of the options want so I'll
05:30 - just leave it as typescript CSS
05:31 - variables and then we can select a UI
05:33 - Library if we want that so I'm just
05:35 - going to leave this as is go ahead and
05:37 - click on Create and I'm going to go to
05:39 - all selected frames so it brings our
05:41 - entire project over into the Builder so
05:44 - what I'll do now is I'll sync this to
05:46 - the Builder we'll give this a second and
05:47 - then I'll run you through the Builder
05:49 - and show you exactly how this works and
05:51 - how we can really take this to the next
05:53 - level all right so we've been redirected
05:54 - to the Builder now and I just want to
05:56 - quickly take a step back and recall what
05:58 - just happened we we opened up a figma
06:00 - file we enabled the locy plugin in figma
06:03 - Dev mode and then in one single click
06:05 - after we selected our options we're able
06:07 - to generate all of the code for that
06:10 - figma file and there's a bunch of
06:12 - different options and now we're viewing
06:13 - it inside of this editor where we can
06:15 - make changes bind data Etc so this
06:18 - platform here is the locy Builder it has
06:20 - a bunch of different things that you can
06:21 - do inside of here I'll give you a quick
06:23 - kind of overview of how it works so that
06:25 - you understand the lay of the land and
06:27 - then we can talk about export settings
06:28 - viewing the and vs code Etc so let's
06:32 - just make this a little bit larger so we
06:34 - can view it a bit easier and we can see
06:36 - here that on the left hand side of our
06:38 - screen we have our layer panel now the
06:40 - layer panel just allows us to view all
06:42 - of the different root components and
06:44 - layers that are created for us so we can
06:46 - see the different frames Etc that we
06:48 - have within the current page we can
06:51 - change into the different pages like the
06:53 - signup page the details the main content
06:55 - and if we want we can go to the file
06:57 - explorer here and we can view all of the
06:59 - different components the CSS and we can
07:01 - restructure this and change the
07:03 - hierarchy if we want to do that now
07:05 - those are kind of the two main things
07:06 - here on the left hand side in the middle
07:09 - of the screen here we have this
07:11 - interactive kind of demo that allows us
07:13 - to select different elements and then I
07:15 - can also change the screen size so I can
07:17 - make sure everything is nice and
07:19 - responsive and you can see that as I do
07:20 - that it actually selects the different
07:22 - frames that I'm on so I can view the
07:24 - entire hierarchy of my project in this
07:26 - layer panel so if I bring the code
07:28 - window up you can see that as I actually
07:30 - select different elements on the screen
07:32 - it automatically adjusts what file and
07:34 - what code it's showing me so that we can
07:36 - see exactly where the relevant code is
07:38 - which is pretty useful now as well as
07:39 - that we've got some options on the right
07:41 - hand side here so we can bind Dynamic
07:43 - data this allows us to actually create
07:45 - State variables and Link those to
07:46 - different components we can configure
07:48 - our code and then we can export sync and
07:51 - deploy this code with a bunch of
07:52 - different options for example we can
07:54 - push it directly to GitHub now another
07:56 - great feature is that we've got a live
07:58 - prototype so if I click on view
07:59 - prototype here you can see that we have
08:01 - the Prototype let me just zoom in a
08:03 - little bit so we can see this easier I
08:05 - can select some different dates for
08:07 - example go ahead and press on search
08:09 - brings me to the next page and then if I
08:12 - want I can actually share this prototype
08:14 - so if I click on share prototype it will
08:16 - give me a public link by default it will
08:18 - go to whatever page I select up here and
08:21 - then we can copy the link paste it
08:23 - people will be able to view the
08:25 - Prototype immediately obviously we can
08:27 - also change the screen size again to
08:28 - make sure that everything looks nice and
08:30 - then we can go back and edit this in the
08:32 - Builder so now let's quickly talk about
08:34 - components because this is one of the
08:36 - main concerns many people have when
08:38 - using a tool like this they want to make
08:39 - sure it's actually giving them good
08:41 - reusable and clean code that has the
08:43 - correct components so we can go ahead
08:45 - and click on view and when we do this
08:47 - we'll be able to see all of the
08:49 - components that have been created by
08:50 - Loco AI what it does is automatically
08:53 - identify all of the reusable components
08:56 - and it will assign human readable names
08:58 - to them now if we scroll through here we
09:00 - can see a few different components and
09:02 - we can go over to something like the
09:04 - stays nearby card now within here we can
09:06 - click between different instances of the
09:08 - component we can see that we're viewing
09:10 - those in the preview and we actually
09:12 - have the ability to edit any of the
09:14 - property names and the values so if we
09:16 - scroll through here we can see all of
09:18 - the prop names which are reusable and
09:19 - actually quite good we then have the
09:21 - ability to detach this component if we
09:23 - want and we can also create manual
09:25 - versions of components as well so let's
09:27 - say at this point you've set up your
09:29 - components you're happy with this and
09:31 - you actually want to take this code now
09:32 - and Export it well first of all you may
09:34 - want to actually change something so if
09:36 - you go to configure code you have the
09:38 - ability to select for example Tailwind
09:40 - instead of CSS modules and now if you
09:42 - just go ahead and click on save it will
09:44 - automatically update the code for you so
09:47 - you can actually see now that if we
09:48 - bring this up in kind of real time there
09:51 - it changed this so now we're using
09:52 - Tailwind classes rather than using our
09:55 - CSS modules anyways let's say you're
09:57 - happy with this now you can go ahead and
09:59 - go to sync export and deploy we've got a
10:02 - bunch of different options here you can
10:03 - go to netlify verell Etc or for most of
10:06 - us we probably want to go to GitHub so
10:08 - what I'll do is click on sync project
10:11 - here so we'll sync the project with
10:12 - GitHub we need to connect our account
10:14 - which I'll do right now and then we can
10:16 - push this to a new repository all right
10:18 - so now that I've connected my GitHub I
10:19 - can just create a new repository so
10:22 - let's just go locy with Tim demo like
10:27 - that and we can confirm this
10:29 - you'll see that we get kind of this
10:31 - GitHub staging view where we can select
10:32 - the files we don't need to change
10:34 - anything here and we'll just push this
10:36 - directly to GitHub all right so now we
10:38 - can go over to our repository and we can
10:41 - see we've got all of the code here we
10:43 - can modify it we can do whatever we'd
10:45 - want with our GitHub repo so now a final
10:48 - step that I'll share with you pretty
10:49 - much all of the kind of conversion from
10:52 - the UI from the figma file to code we
10:55 - don't actually need to do from our web
10:56 - browser we can do it directly from our
10:58 - ID like vs code so let me show you here
11:01 - a great plugin that we can use
11:02 - specifically figma plugin that lets us
11:04 - pretty much follow along with those same
11:06 - steps directly in the IDE all right so I
11:08 - just opened up vs code here and what we
11:11 - can do is actually enable the figma
11:13 - extension so if I type here in the
11:15 - extension panel figma you can see this
11:18 - will pop up now I've already installed
11:20 - it obviously you need to install it and
11:22 - then sign in and then you can click on
11:24 - it on the bottom left here so when I
11:26 - click on figma you'll see we get a bunch
11:28 - of different projects
11:29 - and go to my shared files and click on
11:31 - the one that I want to open up and here
11:34 - now we can close that Tab and you'll see
11:36 - that it actually loads up figma for us
11:38 - on the right hand side of the screen so
11:40 - now what we can do is Click into a frame
11:42 - so maybe we'll click into the homepage
11:44 - here and we can now enable the locy
11:46 - plugin directly from vs code in this
11:49 - figma extension so we'll just type locy
11:53 - click on that and now we'll be able to
11:54 - do the exact same steps where we can run
11:57 - and automatically convert this into into
11:59 - code so if we scroll down here we have
12:01 - the ability to say let's go so again we
12:04 - can click on what we want so react
12:06 - typescript Etc we'll click on let's go
12:09 - we can select the frame that we want so
12:11 - let's just make this a little bit larger
12:14 - let's select the homepage for example
12:15 - maybe this time we just want to do one
12:17 - frame and we can go ahead and convert
12:20 - that now again locy is going to
12:21 - automatically optimize this design for
12:23 - us and then spit out the finished code
12:25 - so there you are we've got our code and
12:27 - the process has finished all right guys
12:30 - so with that I think I'm going to wrap
12:32 - up the video here now I just wanted to
12:34 - show you this really gamechanging AI
12:36 - tool that is pretty incredible from
12:38 - going from a design to code in quite
12:40 - literally one step obviously there's
12:42 - tons of customizations a lot of other
12:44 - features you can mess around with but I
12:46 - want to thank locy for sponsoring this
12:48 - video and allowing me to share this
12:50 - product with you as I said it's
12:52 - currently free you can check it out mess
12:54 - with it in figma or directly inside a vs
12:56 - code and hopefully it's going to save
12:57 - you a ton of time like it's been saving
12:59 - me so thank you very much for watching
13:01 - if you enjoyed make sure to leave a like
13:03 - subscribe to the channel and I will see
13:05 - you in the next
13:10 - [Music]
13:13 - one
