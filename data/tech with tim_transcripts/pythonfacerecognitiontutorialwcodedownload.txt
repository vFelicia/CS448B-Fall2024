00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to the YouTube
00:02 - video so in today's video I'm gonna be
00:04 - showing you how to perform base and
00:05 - recognition and detection on any image
00:08 - in Python that you want now this script
00:11 - that I wrote that I'm gonna be allowing
00:12 - you guys to download for free in the
00:14 - description down below will show you how
00:16 - you can detect any faces that you want
00:19 - so not just Donald Trump it could be a
00:21 - face of you it could be a face of your
00:22 - friend it could be a face of celebrities
00:23 - any faces that you want and as many as
00:26 - you want in any image that you want to
00:28 - use so a very useful script and I'm
00:30 - going to be walking you guys through
00:31 - first of all just how to install and
00:32 - actually run the script because it does
00:34 - have a few dependencies and then how you
00:36 - can modify it to work in your own
00:37 - setting for your own projects so a
00:39 - little bit less of a tutorial and more
00:41 - of kind of a showcase and how to use the
00:43 - script but hopefully you guys get some
00:45 - value from this and if you do definitely
00:47 - hit the like button and let me know any
00:48 - comments down below so anyways right now
00:50 - you can see I have this script and what
00:52 - it does is just draw boxes around faces
00:54 - and then tries to identify which ones
00:56 - they are based on a list of faces that
00:58 - it's given so you can see that right now
01:00 - if you go to the link in the description
01:02 - there'll be a link it should be titled
01:03 - like download code or something like
01:05 - that and once you do that if you
01:07 - download the zip file that'll be there
01:09 - you'll get a zip file called face rec
01:11 - SEP if you extract that and open up the
01:13 - folder you should see four files that
01:16 - look like this now what you're gonna do
01:18 - is you're gonna place any image inside
01:20 - of this main directory here so instead
01:21 - of face recognition called test jpg and
01:24 - this will be the B file or the image
01:27 - that your program is going to try to
01:29 - find the faces in and detect which ones
01:31 - they are now inside of this faces folder
01:34 - is where you're gonna put your known
01:35 - faces so whatever faces you want to try
01:37 - to detect or recognize you're gonna put
01:40 - them in here and you're just gonna label
01:41 - them whatever face they are so in this
01:43 - case you can see that mine says Bill
01:44 - Gates and if I were to rename this what
01:48 - all you essentially do is you just call
01:49 - them bill gates at whatever the name of
01:51 - the image is here Donald Trump you know
01:53 - musk Jeff Bezos Obama so currently my
01:56 - program that I have can detect these
01:58 - five people and no one else so just put
02:01 - all of the people in here that you want
02:02 - to try to detect and then if it sees
02:04 - something that looks similar to that
02:06 - person well it will detect it and it
02:08 - will put it up on the screen otherwise
02:10 - like you've seen before it'll just show
02:11 - unknown but it will still
02:13 - you wear the face in the image is all
02:15 - right now you can also see that I have a
02:17 - script here which is what you're
02:18 - actually gonna run to run this program
02:19 - and there's a requirements txt file
02:22 - which shows you the Python modules that
02:24 - you need to install now before we can
02:26 - install this and it's very easy the way
02:28 - that I've set this up for you guys
02:29 - we just need to install a C++ compiler
02:32 - for our computer so the way that we do
02:34 - this is you're gonna go to another link
02:36 - I have in the description description
02:38 - and you're gonna download Visual Studio
02:39 - 2019 Community Edition so this free
02:42 - version here so I'm just gonna click
02:43 - free download and I already have this
02:45 - downloaded but I'm gonna walk through
02:46 - the steps with you guys to make sure
02:47 - that you get this correct so once you
02:50 - download this click keep run this
02:52 - installer wait for it to go through this
02:54 - install process and then it's gonna
02:56 - bring you to a menu where it's gonna ask
02:58 - you to install some specific packages
03:00 - and you're gonna have to choose which
03:01 - ones so once we get to there I'm going
03:03 - to show you which ones to pick and then
03:05 - we'll move on to actually looking at the
03:06 - code after that alright so now I mean
03:08 - here since I already have mine installed
03:10 - it looks a little bit different but if I
03:12 - click modify it should bring up a
03:13 - similar menu to what you guys are gonna
03:15 - see and what you need to select here is
03:17 - simply desktop development with C++ so
03:20 - this is the only package you guys need
03:22 - for this program to work this is about 6
03:24 - gigabytes of file so it will take a few
03:26 - minutes to install but just click on
03:28 - this and then click install now I
03:30 - already have mine installed so obviously
03:32 - I'm not gonna do that but once you
03:33 - finish that you're gonna restart your
03:34 - computer and then you're gonna follow
03:36 - the steps that I'm about to outline now
03:37 - all right so let's close these and now
03:40 - what we're gonna do is we need to get
03:41 - inside of this directory right here so
03:44 - wherever face recognition is where
03:45 - you've extracted this file from and
03:47 - you're just gonna type CMD now it's
03:49 - gonna pop up a command prompt window and
03:51 - what we're gonna do is now try to
03:53 - install the Python modules that this
03:54 - project needs now before we do this we
03:57 - have to make sure that we're running a
03:58 - 64-bit version of Python if you if you
04:02 - don't know to check what version you're
04:03 - using just go to uninstall so how to
04:06 - remove programs my bad sorry on windows
04:08 - 10 you can scroll down to wherever it
04:10 - says P so python here and just check
04:14 - what bit version of python you're using
04:16 - again it must be a 64-bit if you're not
04:19 - using a 64-bit version of python you can
04:21 - uninstall your current version of python
04:23 - and install a 64-bit version or just
04:26 - install 64
04:27 - version and use that or installing all
04:30 - your packages into that alright so once
04:32 - you've done that now you're just gonna
04:34 - type pip install - R and then
04:37 - requirements dot txt again since we're
04:40 - in this directory face-recognition and
04:42 - you can see that by just looking here to
04:44 - make sure this is the correct folder
04:45 - what its gonna do is just automatically
04:47 - install all of those modules that I've
04:49 - listed making it really easy for you
04:50 - guys so gonna hit enter enter like that
04:53 - now I already have them installed so
04:55 - mine just kind of whiz through this but
04:56 - yours will take a few minutes to install
04:58 - now if you have any issues with this
05:00 - leave a comment down below as there is a
05:01 - few problems that you could run into but
05:03 - as long as you have that C++ installed
05:05 - and you have a 64-bit version of Python
05:08 - you shouldn't run into any issues
05:10 - alright so now that we've done that it's
05:12 - actually time to just run the code now
05:15 - to run the code is really easy all you
05:16 - do is just type Python and then the name
05:19 - of that file so face recognition PI and
05:21 - then it will load up the file for you
05:23 - and start doing that face recognition
05:25 - now it does take a second to boot up but
05:28 - there you go we get Donald Trump and
05:30 - it's recognizing that face now if you
05:32 - want it to change the face again all you
05:34 - do is you go here and just modify this
05:36 - file name to or modify this file so you
05:39 - put a new file called test JPEG and then
05:41 - it will load up that file the next time
05:43 - and do the face recognition on that
05:45 - alright so now that you've I've showed
05:47 - you guys how to use this program I'm
05:49 - gonna show you how this code works just
05:51 - very minimally so that if you want them
05:53 - to try to modify it or use it in your
05:54 - own Python projects you'll have an idea
05:56 - of how to do that so right now I'm just
05:59 - gonna run through some of the functions
06:00 - so what this first function does here is
06:02 - get encoded faces essentially it reads
06:05 - through all of the faces if I can find
06:07 - them here inside of this faces folder
06:09 - and it simply encodes all those faces
06:12 - into a format that the machine learning
06:14 - model that's inside a face recognition
06:16 - can use and actually well yeah used to
06:20 - detect our faces essentially now it's
06:23 - important that you just name these faces
06:25 - in here what they are so in this case
06:26 - I've named this Obama jpg jeff bezos jpg
06:29 - Elon Musk jpg because that's how it's
06:32 - actually gonna label your faces based on
06:35 - whatever labels you put here all right
06:37 - so that's what encoded faces does it
06:39 - just reads through that in title
06:40 - tire folder unknown image encoding
06:42 - simply gets whatever the image name is
06:45 - given and encodes that into a format
06:47 - that again our machine learning model
06:48 - can read and we'll return that same with
06:51 - this returning that as well
06:52 - now what classify face does is all it
06:54 - does is take the name of an image so in
06:57 - this case you can see it down here I'm
06:58 - calling it and giving it test on JPEG so
07:01 - that's the name of the file that I want
07:02 - to do the face recognition for and then
07:04 - is gonna bring up that box and do the
07:07 - detection and show you what face is
07:09 - which but it's also gonna return to you
07:11 - a list of faces so if you see here when
07:14 - I ran this it gave me Donald Trump and
07:15 - unknown so I can actually see which
07:18 - faces are in my image now in here what's
07:21 - happening is we start by getting all the
07:23 - encoded faces as faces so we call this
07:26 - function then we start by actually
07:28 - turning these into a list and into all
07:31 - of the names because this is returned as
07:33 - a dictionary so we say face is encoded
07:35 - is all the values and the names of all
07:37 - those faces are all of the keys then
07:40 - what we do is we read in the image that
07:42 - we've been given so in this case test
07:43 - JPEG if we wanted to we could resize it
07:46 - by using these two lines which I've just
07:48 - commented out because I'm not doing that
07:49 - right now
07:50 - then we find all of the locations of the
07:52 - face in our images in our image by
07:55 - simply passing IMG which again is read
07:57 - in by OpenCV and it's gonna find all of
08:00 - those locations for our faces then what
08:02 - we do is we encode our unknown face
08:04 - which is gonna be that test
08:05 - JPEG image again and now what we do is
08:08 - simply compare all of the faces that we
08:10 - know against the faces in the images and
08:13 - see if any of them are the same now if
08:16 - they are what we do is we draw that
08:19 - little box and we write the name of the
08:21 - face otherwise we're just gonna write
08:22 - unknown and that is simply how this
08:25 - works now this part right here this for
08:27 - loop is responsible for actually drawing
08:29 - on the image if you were to remove this
08:31 - your program would still work it just
08:33 - wouldn't draw anything on the image it
08:35 - would simply just return to you that
08:36 - names of the faces that are in that
08:39 - image and that is essentially how this
08:42 - works I'm not gonna go through much more
08:43 - of it but if you guys have any questions
08:45 - feel free to let me know I hope that you
08:47 - guys can get this script working and
08:49 - it's super useful and kind of
08:50 - interesting to be able to play with and
08:51 - see where it's limited and how
08:54 - works but a massive thank you to ever
08:55 - wrote this face recognition module
08:57 - because it's super useful and simply
08:59 - allows people like me who maybe aren't
09:01 - machine learning experts to use face
09:03 - recognition in all their programs and
09:05 - something that I'm personally using this
09:06 - for is a security system where what it's
09:08 - doing is tracking when certain people
09:11 - come in to certain areas and kind of
09:13 - comparing those video footages and
09:14 - storing that and all that fun stuff so
09:16 - anyways if you guys enjoyed this video
09:18 - please make sure you leave a like and
09:19 - subscribe to the channel and I will see
09:21 - you guys in another video
