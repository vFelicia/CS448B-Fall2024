00:00 - python go rust C PHP JavaScript Java
00:05 - Ruby there are so many different options
00:07 - and it can be overwhelming to figure out
00:09 - which one to actually pick so today
00:11 - let's break down which backend language
00:14 - is best for you let's Dive Right In with
00:16 - Java now Java is ideal for the
00:18 - Enterprise level developer think about
00:20 - building large scale enterprise software
00:23 - like banking or financial services now
00:25 - Java can be used for a ton of different
00:27 - things but typically you'll be doing
00:28 - large scale develop you may be working
00:31 - on Android apps or dealing with big data
00:33 - Technologies now Java developers are
00:35 - always in high demand especially in the
00:37 - Enterprise sector and compared to a lot
00:39 - of other languages they have very high
00:41 - job stability overall you should choose
00:43 - Java for its Enterprise grade
00:45 - applications due to its robust
00:47 - performance scalability and vast
00:49 - ecosystems of libraries and Frameworks
00:52 - so now we move on to python now python
00:54 - is typically best for newcomers due to
00:56 - its readability and simplicity it's used
00:58 - for web applications data science
01:01 - machine learning and automation now you
01:03 - can use Python for a ton of different
01:04 - things but typically when it comes to
01:06 - getting a job with python you need to be
01:08 - really good in a specific framework or
01:10 - area or have some other languages under
01:12 - your belt as well if you're just looking
01:14 - for some hobby projects python is great
01:16 - to pick up but if you want a long-term
01:18 - career you need to be really good in a
01:20 - specific area or potentially learn some
01:22 - other languages as well now overall you
01:24 - should opt for python if you value
01:26 - developer productivity and versatility
01:29 - with extensive Li libraries for web
01:30 - development data analysis and machine
01:32 - learning so now we move on to JavaScript
01:35 - or node.js now JavaScript is best for
01:38 - those of you that want to be full stack
01:39 - developers that's because with a single
01:41 - language you can write code on both the
01:43 - front end and the back end JavaScript
01:45 - can be used in a lot of different places
01:47 - but typically it's going to be used for
01:48 - building web applications in this case
01:50 - web backends or real-time applications
01:53 - like chat apps with that in mind if
01:55 - you're a JavaScript developer you're
01:57 - going to have a lot of prospects for
01:58 - startups or earlier stage companies
02:00 - because they're typically using
02:01 - JavaScript for their entire stack they
02:03 - don't want to hire seven different
02:05 - developers that know all these different
02:06 - languages they want one that can write
02:08 - on both the front end and the back end
02:10 - overall you should select JavaScript or
02:12 - node.js for full stack development in
02:15 - realtime applications benefiting from a
02:17 - non-blocking IO model and a unified
02:19 - language across the client and the
02:21 - server and by the way if your goal is to
02:24 - become a software developer and you're
02:26 - still looking for that first position
02:27 - then consider checking out my program
02:29 - with c careers we teach you everything
02:31 - you need to know as well as give you a
02:33 - specialization in frontend backend or
02:35 - devops so you'll actually stand out and
02:37 - have that specialized knowledge that a
02:39 - lot of other Junior developers don't
02:41 - have now I won't lie to you the job
02:43 - market is tough right now it is
02:45 - difficult to land a job but if you have
02:46 - the right guidance and you optimize all
02:48 - of the little things like your LinkedIn
02:50 - profile your resume you actually know
02:52 - the type of jobs to apply to you can
02:54 - significantly increase your success
02:56 - we've already seen that act course
02:58 - careers with students that have
02:59 - graduated and landed jobs in just a few
03:01 - weeks there's an entire free
03:03 - introduction course no obligation you
03:05 - can check it out from the link in the
03:06 - description so now we can move on to
03:08 - Ruby now Ruby is for the rapid app
03:11 - developer those of you that want to push
03:13 - products to Market as quickly as
03:15 - possible it's really popular in the
03:16 - e-commerce space than websites like
03:18 - Shopify for Content management and for
03:21 - database web backend applications Ruby
03:24 - is obviously used with Ruby on Rails and
03:26 - anyone who's really good in Ruby is
03:28 - always going to have job prospects
03:30 - because a lot of tech firms are
03:31 - constantly looking for Ruby on Rails
03:33 - depths with that in mind you should use
03:35 - Ruby on Rails for Rapid development
03:37 - cycles and startup environments where
03:39 - time to Market and Convention overc
03:41 - configuration are prioritized so now we
03:44 - can discuss the dreaded PHP now everyone
03:47 - loves to hate on PHP but the truth is
03:49 - it's very useful and it's really used
03:51 - all over the web it's very popular for
03:54 - small business websites blogs think
03:56 - things like WordPress that's completely
03:58 - built on PHP that means that it's in
04:01 - pretty high demand a lot of new
04:02 - developers aren't learning it and if you
04:04 - know PHP you're going to be able to pick
04:06 - up a lot of jobs especially servicing
04:08 - old sites which a lot of companies need
04:10 - and working with platforms like
04:12 - WordPress it's big for e-commerce and it
04:15 - actually is pretty fast in terms of
04:16 - building web apps overall you should go
04:19 - with PHP for a wide range of web
04:21 - development needs particularly effective
04:23 - in content Management systems and sites
04:25 - with Dynamic content so now we get into
04:28 - C now C is ideal for those of you
04:30 - invested in the Microsoft ecosystem
04:33 - Windows Xbox Etc it's very popular for
04:36 - Enterprise grade level backends building
04:38 - games think Frameworks like unity and
04:40 - for desktop applications as well C
04:43 - always has high job demand people are
04:45 - always looking for experienced C
04:47 - developers again especially in that
04:49 - Enterprise sector where you're building
04:51 - larger and larger applications now
04:53 - overall you should choose C for robust
04:55 - desktop and Enterprise applications
04:57 - within the Microsoft ecosystem
04:59 - leveraging the net framework's extensive
05:02 - capabilities so now we get into go or
05:04 - goang which is personally one of my
05:06 - favorite languages and one that we
05:08 - actually have an entire section on in my
05:10 - course careers program regardless go is
05:12 - used for building highly performant and
05:14 - scalable systems it's really used for
05:16 - building distributed systems
05:18 - microservices and large scale cloud
05:20 - services it's increasingly popular in
05:22 - the data streaming space as well as the
05:25 - cloud services space and really for
05:27 - those that need the utmost performance
05:29 - overall should pick go for concurrent
05:31 - applications and microservices where
05:33 - performance and efficiency are critical
05:35 - thanks to its lightweight go routines
05:37 - and out of the box scalability so
05:39 - finally we get to rust now this is ideal
05:42 - for developers that need absolute
05:43 - control over system resources without
05:46 - compromising on performance especially
05:48 - when safety and concurrency are of
05:50 - utmost importance now Russ can be used
05:53 - for so many different things I'm just
05:54 - going to list them out here Network
05:56 - Services simulation engines for things
05:58 - like virtual reality platforms game
06:01 - engines and really anything that's
06:02 - performance critical you can build so
06:04 - many different types of applications in
06:06 - Rust and a lot of people are migrating
06:08 - to rust now because of how much they
06:09 - love the language rust is constantly
06:12 - growing in demand especially when it
06:13 - comes to high performance Computing and
06:15 - it's also used for things like
06:16 - cryptocurrency platforms and embedded
06:19 - systems overall you should select rust
06:21 - for system level programming where
06:23 - safety and performance are Paramount
06:25 - offering memory safety without garbage
06:27 - collection so there you have it those
06:29 - are the eight backend languages I
06:30 - covered in this video there are some
06:32 - more but these are the most popular and
06:34 - hopefully this helped you make the
06:35 - decision on which one you want to pick
06:37 - if you want to become a software
06:39 - developer check out my program with
06:40 - course careers like the video of course
