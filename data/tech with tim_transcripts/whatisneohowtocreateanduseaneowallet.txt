00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:01 - video in today's video I'm just gonna be
00:03 - talking very basically about neo which
00:06 - is a cryptocurrency much like Bitcoin
00:09 - and aetherium and it's very new to the
00:11 - market and is up and coming
00:13 - so a lot of people have been putting a
00:15 - lot of money into neo as you can see the
00:17 - market cap here is that 1 billion just
00:20 - about a month ago or less than a month
00:21 - ago actually was that 2 billion so it's
00:24 - a huge market cap for a new IC o---- or
00:26 - for a new sorry cryptocurrency so it's
00:30 - been getting a lot of hype lately and I
00:31 - figured I just do a video explaining
00:33 - very basically what it is and how it
00:35 - works so if you know anything about
00:37 - crypto currencies you understand that
00:39 - their form of decentralized currency so
00:42 - unlike a bank they're not controlled by
00:44 - one person or one by one organization
00:46 - but by a community of people and by
00:49 - miners and things like that so not one
00:52 - person controls the currency
00:54 - decentralized pretty much so neo is a
00:58 - new currency it's been coming up in the
01:00 - market lately and a lot of people have
01:02 - been speculating about it and saying
01:04 - that it is the new aetherium and that
01:07 - soon it'll be rising to huge prices and
01:10 - personally I do agree I'm not going to
01:12 - give you a whole technical analysis of
01:14 - neo and if you should invest or not but
01:16 - personally I've invested a little bit in
01:19 - Sydney oh and I'm holding it for the
01:21 - long term and I'm just gonna continually
01:23 - keep increasing my portfolio hoping that
01:26 - this thing is going to go up and from
01:27 - what it looks like it probably is so
01:30 - pretty much a lot of people are saying
01:31 - neo is like the Chinese aetherium and
01:34 - it's rooted directly into China and you
01:37 - can see the chart here
01:39 - we've had a huge growth in the last few
01:41 - weeks in the last month it hit up to I
01:43 - think the top was about $50 or here I
01:46 - can't quite get it's 46 right there and
01:48 - now we've been dropping down drastically
01:51 - to it the last few weeks down to I think
01:55 - the lowest price we got to was about $17
01:58 - so yeah right now is when I'm buying my
02:03 - neo because it's not an all-time low and
02:04 - personally I believe that it's gonna
02:06 - keep going up and because it does have a
02:08 - great technology behind it now with neo
02:11 - when you buy it
02:13 - you're actually able to stake your neo
02:14 - and store it in a wallet where it can
02:17 - collect something called gas now if I
02:19 - find the gas price so gas price Neil we
02:24 - can see that the gas price actually has
02:28 - grows as neo grows so here we'll just go
02:31 - to gas and you can see that it has a
02:33 - value of nine dollars and 79 cents now
02:35 - what happens here is rather than mining
02:39 - so using physical mining you actually
02:42 - stake your neo in the system and it's
02:43 - used to secure transactions so by doing
02:47 - this you receive a reward which is in
02:50 - the form of gas so gas kind of follows
02:53 - the same price as neo for right now but
02:55 - it is more stable and it's used for
02:58 - transactions so I'm not gonna go too far
03:00 - into that but just know when you stake
03:02 - your neo using something called a wallet
03:05 - which I'm gonna show you in a second you
03:06 - collect gas so now here's the next thing
03:09 - that we want to talk about so we kind of
03:10 - vaguely talked about neo and I'm gonna
03:12 - do a video more in-depth on it later but
03:15 - pretty much what do you do when you want
03:17 - to save your Neil so you can actually
03:18 - save it in something called a wall no
03:20 - this is my neo wallet right here you can
03:23 - see my public address if any of you want
03:24 - to send me any neo that would be awesome
03:26 - and then you can see the amount of neo I
03:29 - have which right now is only six a very
03:30 - small amount its price in USD currently
03:33 - so add it up so about each coin is worth
03:35 - $20 and then the gas price are sorry not
03:39 - the gas price but the gas collected so
03:40 - I've only had this neo on my account for
03:42 - a few days and already I've collected
03:45 - 0.015 of gas so that's about 60 cents
03:49 - like not even 60 cents a very small
03:51 - amount of gas has been collected so
03:55 - that's pretty much what happens when you
03:57 - stake your neo by sending it into a
03:59 - wallet like this and I'm gonna show you
04:01 - how to download that wallet you actually
04:02 - can collect gas and you can claim the
04:04 - gas so obviously I want to claim the gas
04:06 - here I can click claim gas and it's
04:08 - gonna send it to myself and it's gonna
04:09 - update this number here so now let's
04:11 - show you how do we get this wallet well
04:13 - it's really easy all you have to type is
04:14 - neo like this and then we'll just find
04:17 - the Neo website so we'll look for a neo
04:20 - so neo smart economy right here and I'll
04:23 - put this link down in the description
04:25 - below if you want to
04:26 - check this out and it brings us to the
04:28 - Neo website so you can see there is
04:29 - Chinese symbols here as it was developed
04:32 - in China and there's some different
04:35 - download links here so we have mobile
04:38 - desktop and web so now for desktop we
04:41 - have three different options obviously
04:43 - we have one for Windows and then one for
04:46 - Mac and Windows and Linux and then it's
04:49 - a second client here so we have some
04:51 - different clients and they show what
04:52 - versions they support now the one that
04:54 - I've downloaded here is called neon and
04:57 - that's what I showed you so feel free to
04:59 - download whatever whichever one you like
05:00 - to I recommend this one neon right here
05:04 - so you can click download there if you
05:06 - want to download that and then once you
05:07 - do that it's gonna bring you here so
05:10 - first of all you're gonna have to create
05:12 - a wallet now I've already gone over how
05:14 - to create a wallet for aetherium it's
05:15 - the same idea here for neo you can use a
05:17 - private key you can use a keystore file
05:19 - all that kind of stuff for creating a
05:22 - wallet very simple just follow the
05:24 - instructions on screen and once you've
05:25 - done that you can use your private key
05:27 - to access your wallet here now what's
05:29 - great here is it does actually tell you
05:31 - that you need to update your wallet so I
05:32 - would have to redownload this if I
05:33 - wanted to send any neo or receive any or
05:36 - not receive sorry send any meal out of
05:37 - this account and you can see the amount
05:39 - of neo you have again and the gas so
05:42 - yeah that's pretty much it for this
05:44 - video I just want to talk about really
05:46 - basically what neo is and how you can
05:49 - store your neo because I was kind of
05:51 - wondering myself once I bought the Neo
05:53 - will where do I put it well you can
05:54 - download a neo wallet just from the Neo
05:56 - website right here send it to your
05:58 - public address which is right here your
06:00 - public and your address you can just
06:01 - copy it like that and then it stores in
06:04 - here and actually collects gas which is
06:06 - awesome of you can actually just make
06:08 - money by letting your neo sit in your
06:10 - wallet
06:11 - so that's why you'd want to take it off
06:12 - of an exchange and send it right into a
06:14 - wallet so you can start collecting this
06:16 - gas okay so that's it for this video I
06:18 - hope you enjoyed if you did please like
06:21 - and subscribe and I will see you again
06:22 - another one
