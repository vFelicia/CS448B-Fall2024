00:00 - hello everyone and welcome back to
00:01 - another Python quick tip so in this
00:03 - video I'm gonna be showing you how we
00:04 - decompose a tuple now essentially what
00:06 - that means is taking the values of a
00:08 - tupple and assigning them individually
00:10 - into variables so for example if we
00:12 - wanted to get the value of 1 & 2 here
00:15 - let's treat this maybe as a coordinate
00:16 - so XY what I can do is do something like
00:19 - X comma y equals t1 now what that's
00:22 - gonna do is actually split up t1 into
00:25 - the variables x and y so X will be 1 and
00:27 - Y will be 2 and if I print that out I
00:29 - can show you that that is indeed true
00:31 - now this works for any number of
00:33 - elements inside the tupple so maybe we
00:36 - have a 3 coordinate here and I do that
00:38 - with t2 and now we can print out XY and
00:41 - Z and we can see we get 1 2 3 now this
00:43 - works the same for functions so a lot of
00:45 - people don't know that you can actually
00:46 - return things just separated by commas
00:48 - from a function so I'll show you if I
00:51 - print out for example func like this
00:53 - you'll see what we actually get here is
00:55 - a tuple and that means we can decompose
00:58 - the results from a tuples so let's say
01:00 - we return three different things from a
01:01 - function well if we want to decompose
01:03 - that what I can do is now say XY Z
01:06 - equals func like that and then again I
01:09 - can print out X Y Z like so and we get 1
01:14 - 2 3 so that is how you decompose a
01:16 - tupple it's very useful sometimes you
01:18 - just want to get the first and second
01:20 - element from a coordinate or something
01:22 - like that and you don't want to have to
01:23 - know go through the method of saying x
01:25 - equals t10
01:28 - for something like that so news that has
01:30 - been how to decompose a double
