00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to their pine
00:02 - qt5 tutorial so in today's video I'm
00:04 - gonna be talking to you about containers
00:06 - and changing some colors and some other
00:09 - stuff in pi QT designer we're not gonna
00:11 - be working with any code today I'm just
00:12 - gonna be showing you some cool stuff in
00:14 - here and with that being said let's get
00:16 - started so the first two things I want
00:18 - to show you guys are containers now the
00:21 - two containers that I'm gonna show today
00:22 - our group boxes and frames so I'm just
00:25 - gonna drag a group box in here to
00:27 - demonstrate how this works and what it
00:29 - is essentially what these do are allow
00:31 - you to apply properties or attributes or
00:35 - whatever you want to call them to all of
00:36 - the widgets that are inside of the
00:38 - container now that means that say you
00:40 - want to have a bunch of labels that all
00:42 - share the same properties or attributes
00:44 - maybe they have the same text size the
00:47 - same color but you don't want to have to
00:49 - change all of them individually what you
00:51 - can do is use something like a group box
00:53 - set the property on the group box and
00:56 - then start dragging those widgets into
00:59 - the group box and they will inherit that
01:01 - property if you're confused just give me
01:03 - a second I'll show you how this works so
01:04 - what I'm gonna do is just go into this
01:06 - group box here which I've dragged in and
01:08 - change the text size to be 48 so you can
01:12 - see nice and large and I can go ahead
01:13 - and change this title and maybe I'll
01:14 - just say group like that now if I drag a
01:18 - label in and I don't put it inside the
01:20 - group box you can see that it by default
01:21 - starts at size 8 right and it's nice and
01:24 - small now if I take a fresh label so
01:27 - let's grab one here and drag it inside
01:29 - of the group box immediately it has that
01:32 - text size applied to it because it's
01:34 - inside that group box so this might not
01:36 - seem super useful right now but when you
01:38 - have a ton of different widgets and
01:40 - you're adding and removing them
01:41 - constantly from the screen it's really
01:44 - nice to be able to just add them into a
01:45 - group box and have all the styling and
01:47 - all the properties applied to them
01:49 - automatically so that's kind of the
01:51 - advantage of doing that now this works
01:53 - the exact same with the frame the only
01:55 - difference with a frame is it doesn't
01:56 - have this title at the top and this
01:59 - little line so it's more subtle and you
02:01 - don't notice it or you actually it's
02:03 - impossible to see because it doesn't
02:04 - show up on the screen so you see it
02:06 - gives us some like dotted lines right
02:07 - now but if I go and just preview this
02:10 - you don't see anything whereas with the
02:12 - group box if I
02:14 - one here and let's go ahead and preview
02:17 - this you do actually see those lines and
02:19 - you see that group box so those are the
02:20 - main differences but these are the exact
02:23 - same the way that they actually work so
02:25 - for this tutorial I'm just gonna use the
02:26 - group box now what I'm gonna do here is
02:29 - just show you kind of how to add a few
02:31 - things into here and make them I don't
02:34 - know a little more customized so what
02:35 - I'm gonna do here just name this labels
02:38 - and we're just gonna add a bunch of
02:39 - labels in here so the first thing I'm
02:41 - gonna do is just Center this text which
02:42 - is something you probably want to do
02:44 - quite often and to do that if I go down
02:46 - to alignment here I can change the
02:48 - horizontal alignment to align each
02:50 - Center now that's gonna put that in the
02:53 - middle for me now if I want to change
02:54 - the font size which I do I'm gonna
02:56 - change that to 22 gonna make that bold
02:59 - and actually it looks for another font
03:01 - that maybe I like better let's use I
03:04 - don't know that
03:04 - alright so that's gonna be our font for
03:06 - this now what I'm gonna do is also
03:08 - change the color of this font and show
03:10 - you how to do that so it applies to all
03:12 - of the other labels and you know what
03:14 - let's rename this red labels alright so
03:18 - to change the color what we do is when
03:20 - we look for something called palate
03:21 - which should be right above the font and
03:23 - rather than choosing inherited what
03:25 - we're gonna do is say change palate now
03:28 - this is where you can change all of the
03:29 - kind of color schemes for your program
03:31 - now what I'm doing is just changing all
03:34 - of the color schemes inside of this
03:36 - group box here but if you wanted to
03:38 - change them for the entire project then
03:40 - what you would do is simply click on
03:42 - this main window here go to change
03:44 - palette and then change that as well now
03:46 - anyways what I'm gonna do is just
03:48 - quickly change this color scheme to be
03:50 - green so if I click OK and then you can
03:53 - see that it shows kind of the
03:54 - differences and what things are gonna
03:55 - look like here now if I want to change
03:57 - the text color what I can do is go and
04:00 - find text color which should be a window
04:03 - text and rather than having it black
04:04 - maybe I'll change that to red
04:06 - alright so now you can see that the text
04:09 - for my radio buttons down here it's kind
04:10 - of give me a preview has changed to red
04:13 - and that is kind of how that works so if
04:16 - I go ahead and click OK now you can see
04:18 - that this changes to red and if I could
04:20 - and try to drag in any labels here we
04:23 - get a red label and you can see you
04:24 - red label like that now let's say you
04:28 - want to have a bunch of red labels let's
04:29 - drag a bunch in here just as an example
04:31 - but there's one label that you don't
04:34 - want to be red you want to have its own
04:36 - properties who wants to change it to
04:37 - color well to do that is really easy all
04:40 - you have to do is just specifically
04:41 - change that label and it won't affect
04:43 - anything else in the group box so what I
04:45 - can do is just go to change palette for
04:47 - this label go to window text change that
04:49 - to black and then you can see that this
04:52 - guy go ahead and changes to black as
04:54 - well and that's kind of all of it all
04:56 - there is two containers and working with
04:59 - them again the frame works the exact
05:01 - same way except you can't see it and
05:03 - just a quick note here you can actually
05:04 - put group boxes inside a group boxes and
05:07 - I'll demonstrate how that works really
05:09 - quickly so if I put another group box in
05:11 - here you can see that immediately it
05:13 - inherits the properties from this one
05:15 - the only thing is it doesn't inherit
05:16 - that pallet property but that's fine
05:18 - because we can go ahead and change that
05:20 - nice and easily in here so if I change
05:22 - this palette and I change the window
05:24 - text I don't know let's go to this color
05:26 - now you can see this group box is gonna
05:28 - change to that and if I go and try to
05:30 - put a button in here then you can see
05:32 - that we get a button and it has that
05:35 - same text property and all of that now
05:36 - for some reason sometimes the colors
05:38 - don't inherit they work for the label
05:40 - but I guess for the button the color
05:42 - scheme doesn't quite work or I have to
05:45 - change the palette even more in here so
05:47 - if I change palette I go to button text
05:49 - that's probably why and change that
05:51 - maybe to red now you can see that this
05:53 - button is gonna get that red text and I
05:56 - can throw a nother button in that one
05:57 - gets red text if I throw a button over
05:59 - here it still keeps this black text
06:01 - because we didn't change that in this
06:03 - main group box so you can kind of see
06:05 - how that was a useful and how you go
06:07 - about using them it's nicer when you're
06:09 - actually dynamically adding things from
06:10 - code into the window which I'll probably
06:12 - do in a later tutorial but that's kind
06:15 - of it for group boxes and frames just
06:16 - want to introduce you to those if you
06:18 - guys enjoyed the video please make sure
06:19 - you leave a like I'll see you in another
