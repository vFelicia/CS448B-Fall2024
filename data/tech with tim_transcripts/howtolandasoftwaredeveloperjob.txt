00:00 - I can't even believe I'm saying this but
00:01 - you need to know the role when you are
00:03 - applying for a job you have to craft
00:05 - your application around the specific
00:07 - role and understand that every company
00:09 - is looking for something slightly
00:10 - different and you want to make your
00:12 - application appear as though you are the
00:15 - ideal candidate for this specific role
00:17 - not any software developer role this
00:20 - specific role so you need to read
00:22 - through the role you need to completely
00:23 - understand it and you need to accept the
00:25 - fact that maybe you aren't the ideal
00:27 - candidate and if that's the scenario
00:29 - maybe you don't apply or you'll omit
00:31 - saying a few things that just make you
00:32 - seem a lot worse than they do better
00:34 - there's a lot of times where you don't
00:36 - need to say something in the application
00:37 - and saying it is just going to hurt you
00:39 - a lot more than it's going to help you
00:40 - want to put yourself in the shoes of the
00:42 - employer and say would I hire me right
00:44 - now writing this application am I the
00:46 - ideal candidate based on what I've
00:48 - written here
