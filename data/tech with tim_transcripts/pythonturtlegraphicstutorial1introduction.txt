00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:02 - YouTube video I just want to apologize
00:04 - right away if my voice is a little bit
00:06 - raspy I have been losing my voice over
00:07 - the past week so just bear with me as I
00:10 - do this tutorial so for this video what
00:13 - I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna be
00:15 - showing you some graphics in with Python
00:18 - so pretty much if you watch some of my
00:20 - previous tutorials I did stuff with PI
00:21 - game I made a side scroller we did like
00:24 - some other kind of game and then I
00:25 - showed you some basic games just using
00:27 - the Python ideally so this is kind of an
00:29 - in-between it's gonna be using something
00:32 - called the turtle module to pretty much
00:33 - move an object around the screen that's
00:36 - gonna be drawing something kind of like
00:37 - a pen and it's cool and it's it's pretty
00:40 - easy to start off with graphics in
00:43 - Python so I'm just going to show a quick
00:44 - example here just by running the script
00:47 - that I wrote so just ask if you'd like
00:49 - to play I click yes or click enter and
00:51 - then you can see it lines up a bunch of
00:53 - turtles on the screen and then they
00:54 - start racing like this so you can see
00:57 - the yellow ones off to the lead and they
00:59 - just kind of randomly move up the screen
01:01 - now the reason they stopped here just
01:03 - because when I made the script is on a
01:04 - laptop so the screen was a lot smaller
01:06 - but you can kind of see how that works
01:08 - so that's like a pretty simple program
01:11 - you can make with the turtle module the
01:13 - reason I have all this stuff here is
01:14 - just because once I finished doing that
01:16 - I have it right out into a text file
01:19 - just kind of scoring how many wins each
01:22 - color turtle has so in this tutorial I
01:25 - may be showing you guys what is a turtle
01:27 - how does it work and how we can kind of
01:30 - move it around the screen a little bit
01:31 - and make some cool shapes and experiment
01:34 - with some different objects so the first
01:36 - part of turtle graphics is importing the
01:39 - modules so this is built into Python you
01:40 - don't need to install anything all you
01:42 - have to do is just type import turtle
01:44 - like that as your first line in your
01:46 - program alright so underneath my comment
01:48 - here underneath the header edge putting
01:50 - import to now what we need to do is we
01:52 - need to create a new turtle object so
01:54 - pretty much the way it works is you
01:56 - create a turtle object and then you can
01:57 - run methods on that object to move the
02:00 - turtle around the screen to make it
02:01 - disappear to stamp something there's a
02:03 - lot of cool things you can do that I'm
02:05 - going to show in the next kind of
02:07 - tutorials so first we'll make a letter
02:09 - to objects so I'm gonna call mine Tim
02:10 - I'm gonna say equals turtle
02:13 - dot turtle like that so the class for
02:16 - turtle is this and we're just
02:18 - referencing the module turtle all right
02:21 - and now we can set a few basic
02:23 - properties for our turtle so there have
02:27 - one called color so Tim Bob color on
02:29 - this can be like an RGB value as well
02:31 - but right now we're just gonna stick
02:33 - with basic colors so I'm just gonna put
02:34 - let's put red can do tim dot pen size
02:40 - and what this does is change the
02:42 - thickness of the line that's gonna
02:44 - appear when the turtle is kind of
02:45 - running around the screen and drawing
02:46 - and this four pen size I'm just gonna
02:49 - put its not in quotes what am i doing
02:52 - it's gonna put five and then we can do
02:55 - Tim dot shape as well so these are kind
02:57 - of the three basic properties that I
02:59 - always like to start off teaching
03:00 - because you can do a few things them you
03:02 - can change them around as you move the
03:04 - turtle around the screen so Tim now
03:06 - color Tim type N size tim shape for
03:08 - shape we have a few different options
03:10 - I believe there's arrow circle turtle
03:13 - and you kind of have you'd have to look
03:16 - up the other ones if you want to see
03:17 - what the shapes are but the one I'm
03:19 - gonna use this turtle for now I'll leave
03:20 - a link in the description down below to
03:22 - the like turtle module manual I guess
03:26 - you can look at all the different
03:27 - options if you want to do that so let's
03:29 - just go ahead and run the program now
03:30 - and see what we've got going so you can
03:33 - see now what we have is we have a red
03:35 - turtle in the middle of the screen has
03:36 - it moved nothing's happening and this is
03:38 - our little turtle window it's gonna be
03:40 - different size based on how big your
03:41 - monitor your display is alright so now
03:44 - we want to do is we want to move our
03:47 - turtle around the screen so you can see
03:48 - it starts off facing right um so let's
03:52 - start moving so the basic methods that
03:54 - we can use to move our turtle are
03:56 - forward backwards
03:59 - I believe it's back yeah I backwards
04:02 - like that and then we have Tim da left
04:05 - and Tim dot right now there is a bunch
04:10 - of other ones you can use to move the
04:12 - turtle there's ones like set position
04:15 - set X Y go to here whatever right but
04:18 - the ones we're gonna use are just
04:19 - forward backwards left right so when I
04:22 - first want to do is I want to first
04:23 - start by moving my turtle 100 pixels to
04:26 - the
04:26 - so 100 is not that many but you'll see
04:29 - what it is and then after I do that I'm
04:31 - gonna turn to the left and inside of
04:33 - this parameter here it takes an angle so
04:36 - if you only if you want to turn left
04:37 - it's gonna go left and then the angle
04:40 - that you put it so if you put 45 it's
04:42 - gonna appear as if you're moving at 135
04:44 - degree angle but it's because it moved
04:46 - left 45 degree angles from where it was
04:48 - so I'm just gonna put 90 to make sure
04:50 - that mine kind of goes like in a box
04:52 - shape
04:52 - I'm gonna go Tim dot forward another
04:56 - hundred pixels and then I'm gonna go Tim
04:58 - dot right 90 like that and let's just
05:01 - see how this looks right right now just
05:03 - by running the program and you can see
05:05 - we go up go boom boom and there we go
05:08 - and then we turn right like that so if I
05:10 - wanted to make a box I would turn left
05:11 - 90 and it would go like that so on all
05:15 - right now a few other methods that we
05:17 - can use here are one that's called pen
05:20 - up and pen down now these are useful
05:22 - when you want to move the turtle around
05:23 - not getting too complex but you don't
05:25 - want to see the line drawn underneath
05:27 - the turtle so for example if I get Tim
05:29 - dot forward and then Tim dot left 90 and
05:31 - I do Tim don't pen up and then after
05:35 - here Tim duck pen down and Tim dot
05:41 - forward another hundred pixels let's
05:45 - watch what happens so we see we draw it
05:48 - lifts the pen up and then it draws
05:50 - another line to the right so that's
05:51 - another way you can move the turtle
05:53 - without it really appearing like you're
05:54 - moving the turtle you can help them also
05:56 - make the turtle invisible you can make
05:58 - it visible again you can change the
06:00 - shape all the stuff that I've done up
06:01 - here you're able to do while you move
06:04 - the turtle so for example he wanted to
06:05 - change colors before we drew this next
06:07 - line I would do
06:08 - oops actually since we're not drawing
06:10 - their blue Tim dark color and then green
06:14 - just like that run the program and you
06:18 - see goes goes up and then draws a green
06:20 - line alright so let's see what else we
06:23 - can kind of do here with the turtle
06:25 - method with the turtle module so these
06:27 - are the really basic shapes are not
06:30 - shapes method sorry that you can use for
06:33 - turtle you can actually draw some pretty
06:35 - cool pictures with it
06:36 - do some different things and you can
06:37 - also have more than one term
06:39 - object at a time so for example if I
06:43 - wanted to make a new turtle object I
06:44 - could do Dave
06:46 - equals turtle dot turtle like this and
06:51 - then I'm gonna set Dave with a bunch of
06:53 - properties as well so I'm going to say
06:54 - Dave color and I'll give him blue and
06:59 - then Dave dog pen size and let's make
07:03 - his pen size 20 so we can really see the
07:05 - difference and then we're just gonna
07:08 - leave his shape as the default jade
07:09 - shape just to show you what it looks
07:11 - like now I want to start off by doing
07:13 - Dave dog backwards I'm gonna move him
07:16 - backwards 100 pixels and yeah let's see
07:20 - what happens here when we have two
07:21 - turtles moving at the same time like
07:24 - that well we're an engineer here there's
07:26 - no actually backwards okay so it
07:28 - actually is just backward not with the S
07:31 - I always get that one mixed up and then
07:33 - you could see Dave starts in the middle
07:34 - of screen and he moves back a hundred
07:37 - pixels like that so you can have
07:38 - multiple turtles if you wanted to move
07:40 - them at the same time it's kind of
07:42 - difficult to do that you would just have
07:44 - to do one command executed after another
07:46 - so if you wanted it to look like they're
07:48 - moving the same time that go Tim go for
07:50 - 100 and then Dave thought backwards 100
07:52 - right after and they would kind of move
07:54 - quickly and one last thing you can also
07:57 - change the speed of the turtle so you do
07:58 - Dave dot speed and you can put this at
08:01 - for example one which I believe is the
08:03 - slowest and so it still goes really fast
08:06 - for speed one but if you go speed five
08:08 - and you're drawing a lot of lines then
08:09 - it would go much faster so that's kind
08:12 - of been a really brief introduction to
08:14 - the turtle module I'm gonna move into
08:17 - making kind of like a game with it in
08:19 - the next few tutorials I just wanted to
08:21 - introduce you guys and show you what
08:22 - you're able to do with the turtle module
08:25 - hopefully you guys are excited for the
08:26 - next videos I know this one was kind of
08:28 - boring but you always have to start
08:30 - somewhere right
08:30 - so if you guys enjoyed the video please
08:32 - make sure you leave a like and subscribe
08:34 - and I will see you again in the next one
