00:00 - hey guys and welcome to a brand new
00:01 - tutorial series on Raspberry Pi now I'm
00:05 - super excited because I just got the
00:06 - brand new B+ Raspberry Pi or at least
00:09 - brand new to me what I'm gonna be doing
00:11 - through these next videos is showing you
00:13 - guys how to use this Raspberry Pi right
00:15 - some cool awesome Python programs with
00:17 - it it will allow us to interact with the
00:19 - outside world so for those of you that
00:21 - don't know this Raspberry Pi has
00:22 - something called GPIO pins let's even
00:24 - get zoomed in on here on the side right
00:26 - here and these essentially allow you
00:28 - from code to have voltage going in or
00:31 - out of them they also allow you to
00:33 - connect sensors and cameras and all that
00:35 - kind of fun stuff so what I'm gonna be
00:37 - doing throughout this series is starting
00:38 - off really basic with just how to
00:40 - trigger like an LED which is what we're
00:42 - gonna be doing in this video and then
00:43 - moving into more complex stuff like the
00:45 - Raspberry Pi camera module which I
00:48 - actually have in here and then we're
00:49 - gonna go into like a little security
00:51 - system which I'm actually building as we
00:53 - speak so anyways I hope you guys are
00:55 - excited for the series if you have any
00:56 - ideas on what you like to see with the
00:58 - Raspberry Pi please leave a comment down
01:00 - below with that being said let me reset
01:01 - up the camera and I'm gonna show you
01:03 - guys how we can set up our first circuit
01:05 - on a breadboard using the Raspberry Pi
01:07 - alright so let's go ahead and get
01:09 - started so from this point on we're
01:11 - gonna need a few things now the first
01:13 - thing I'm gonna assume is that you guys
01:14 - first of all have this Raspberry Pi and
01:16 - you've at least opened it up out of the
01:18 - box and maybe looked at it and played
01:19 - with it a little bit I'm also going to
01:21 - assume that you've installed the
01:22 - operating system on to this so this
01:24 - little SD card here at the bottom you
01:26 - guys can kind of see it there I'm
01:27 - assuming you've kind of played with that
01:29 - and assumed how to get that on so if you
01:31 - haven't done that go ahead and do that
01:32 - before following this tutorial now the
01:34 - next thing we're gonna need is we're
01:36 - gonna need a breadboard and we're gonna
01:38 - need some of these jumper cables so I
01:41 - actually have two types of cables I have
01:42 - what's known as a female thank you guys
01:45 - can see that there - male cable so this
01:47 - has a prong and no prong and this is
01:49 - going to allow us to put this on some of
01:52 - these GPIO pins and we also have male to
01:55 - male jumper wires which are what we're
01:56 - gonna use for the breadboard mainly and
01:58 - you can see that they have two prongs I
01:59 - know it's kind of blurry the way the
02:00 - camera is but hopefully you get the
02:02 - point there so make sure you guys pick
02:04 - those up you can buy them at any kind of
02:06 - electronics store or you can just get
02:07 - them off Hamazon I'll leave some links
02:09 - in the description down below so now
02:11 - what we're gonna do is we're just going
02:13 - to start
02:13 - looking up this Raspberry Pi to the
02:15 - breadboard so that when we eventually
02:17 - turn it on and start programming we
02:20 - don't have to do anything we can
02:21 - actually just work it directly with the
02:22 - code and now it's very important that
02:24 - you do this while your Raspberry Pi is
02:26 - off if you do this while your Raspberry
02:28 - Pi is on you have a very high chance of
02:30 - shorting it which is not good in most
02:33 - cases when you short your Raspberry Pi
02:35 - what's happening is essentially you're
02:37 - putting voltage into one of the ground
02:39 - pins or a pin that's not expecting that
02:41 - much voltage which means the whole board
02:43 - gets a ton of voltage on it and then it
02:45 - just shuts off now in some cases you can
02:47 - actually fry your board Raspberry Pi
02:49 - tries to avoid this by going into
02:51 - recovery mode but just you don't want to
02:53 - be in that situation so please turn this
02:55 - off before you start working with any of
02:57 - the pins now we're going to talk about
03:00 - these GPIO pins so you guys can see them
03:02 - here and what we're gonna be doing is
03:04 - working with the pins on the bottom
03:06 - right side here so right where that
03:08 - Raspberry Pi icon is and to clarify here
03:10 - I'm using the Raspberry Pi model b+
03:13 - which has 40 GPIO pins so the pins we're
03:16 - gonna be using I'm trying not to get too
03:17 - close to the camera here are gonna be on
03:19 - this side so we're actually gonna hook
03:21 - up our first wire and we're gonna hook
03:24 - up the female side to this top right pin
03:26 - or sorry bottom right pin which is gonna
03:28 - be the 5 volt pin now this is just
03:31 - always 5 volts going through it so
03:34 - obviously be careful if this is on
03:36 - because it's gonna be a live wire that
03:38 - has 5 volts going through it now the
03:40 - next cable we're gonna hook up I'm gonna
03:42 - hook up this black one is going to be
03:44 - two pins to the left of that and this is
03:46 - what's known as our ground pin so let me
03:48 - get it in and then I'll show you guys so
03:50 - right there you can see that we have one
03:51 - space and two cables like that now what
03:55 - we need essentially whenever we're
03:56 - creating a circuit is we need some kind
03:58 - of power which is going to come out of
03:59 - this and then we need some kind of
04:00 - ground now the ground is gonna be what
04:03 - completes the circuit so if you guys
04:05 - don't know that anything about
04:06 - electricity essentially you need the
04:07 - circuit to be complete like that for
04:10 - anything to actually happen otherwise it
04:12 - just doesn't work so once we've done
04:14 - that now we're actually gonna hook these
04:15 - up to our breadboard now if you look at
04:18 - the breadboard here you'll see that we
04:19 - have what's known as a positive rail and
04:21 - a negative rail so right there positive
04:23 - and negative so what we're gonna do is
04:25 - we're gonna plug in
04:26 - our positive wire which is actually
04:29 - going to be the live wire which the
04:31 - voltage is going into into any slot on
04:33 - this red rail the way that this red rail
04:35 - works is when you plug something into
04:37 - here there's a metal strip underneath it
04:39 - it attaches to all of these other holes
04:41 - so essentially anytime we plug another
04:44 - jumper wire into this red hole if this
04:47 - is giving us voltage then it's gonna get
04:49 - voltage from that as well now for ground
04:51 - we're gonna do the same thing except
04:52 - we're gonna plug it into any one on the
04:55 - negative rail right here now I'm just
04:56 - gonna plug them in beside each other but
04:58 - notice that since this line that goes
05:00 - here you can tell that this is a rail
05:02 - which means the whole thing is going to
05:03 - be charged from any two wires going like
05:06 - this now the way the bread we're
05:08 - breadboard works other than that is you
05:11 - see the rows like this so for example if
05:13 - you look at like row 10 which is right
05:16 - here you can see that what's actually
05:18 - how this works essentially is if you
05:19 - plug something into that pin all of the
05:22 - other pins in that row will get the
05:24 - charge from that you guys might not
05:26 - understand this right now but as we
05:27 - start playing with the breadboard you'll
05:28 - understand essentially the rails go like
05:31 - that and the rows go like that but do
05:34 - not go past this dividing line here so
05:37 - you can almost think this is like two
05:38 - little bread boards where this is one
05:40 - breadboard and this is the other and
05:42 - they're attached by this kind of divider
05:43 - so someone you plug in here is not gonna
05:46 - be charged on this side and you guys all
05:47 - understand that as we go through so now
05:49 - that we've done that we've plugged into
05:51 - the positive and negative rail what
05:53 - we're actually gonna do is we're gonna
05:54 - use this male to male jumper wires and
05:58 - we're gonna hook them up on these rails
06:00 - so just plug one cable in anywhere on
06:02 - the negative rail and another cable in
06:05 - anywhere on the positive rail now we're
06:08 - gonna use these to connect to our LEDs
06:10 - which I'm going to grab in just a second
06:12 - as well as a resistor so the next thing
06:15 - we're gonna need is a resistor and I'll
06:16 - be back in one second with those all
06:19 - right so I've got one of these LEDs now
06:21 - here you can see this little green LED
06:22 - it's not really focusing too well and
06:24 - what we're gonna do now is we're gonna
06:25 - plug this into the breadboard and then
06:27 - we're gonna plug in these male jumper
06:29 - wires to connect to it as well as one of
06:32 - these resistors now the reason we're
06:34 - using a resistor is because these LEDs
06:37 - don't actually use enough voltage to
06:39 - absorb
06:40 - enough voltage so you don't short your
06:42 - board so essentially what happens in a
06:44 - in a circuit is you need to have
06:46 - something using the voltage so in this
06:49 - case our LED is gonna use the voltage
06:52 - and create some kind of light and
06:54 - transform essentially those electrons
06:56 - and that energy into a source of heat
06:58 - which will be this light okay now I know
07:01 - it sounds like really science II it's
07:02 - not that complicated but essentially all
07:04 - I'm saying here is this does not
07:06 - transform enough energy which means that
07:08 - when we pass through this led too much
07:11 - current is going to be coming out of the
07:12 - LED into our Raspberry Pi here which
07:15 - means that it could possibly short so to
07:17 - be safe we're gonna use a resistor now
07:20 - the resistor that I'm using is 100 ohms
07:22 - now you don't really need to know what
07:24 - the ohms means but that's just the
07:25 - amount of resistance so just try to get
07:27 - one that's at least 50 ohms and use that
07:30 - now you can try to use it without a
07:33 - resistor and just see what happens worst
07:35 - case your board will might turn off but
07:38 - I don't think anything will actually
07:39 - happen to it like too dangerous again
07:41 - don't take my word for that but I've
07:43 - used it without a resistor and it works
07:44 - just to be safe though I like to
07:46 - recommend to people to use a resistor
07:48 - like this so what we're gonna do now is
07:50 - just start setting some things up on our
07:52 - breadboard some of these might move my
07:54 - Raspberry Pi and zoom in a little bit
07:55 - here just so we can see this a little
07:57 - bit better so what I'm gonna do is I'm
07:59 - actually going to set up my resistor so
08:01 - it goes into this negative rail so you
08:03 - can see that I'm actually plugging that
08:04 - in on that negative rail so it lines up
08:07 - with that blue wire here which is gonna
08:10 - be plugged in somewhere else and you
08:12 - guys will see where that is
08:14 - actually we can remove this blue wire my
08:16 - mistake guys we're gonna get rid of that
08:17 - blue wire and just leave the green now
08:19 - what I'm gonna do is plug in this
08:21 - resistor just anywhere else on the board
08:24 - close enough to it that it obviously fit
08:26 - so you guess you have just decide to
08:27 - plug that in and bro 21 but to make sure
08:30 - that it goes in the holes and it fits
08:32 - like that the next thing we're going to
08:33 - do is we're going to use our LED now the
08:35 - LED has to what do you call it little
08:39 - sides on it so one of them you can see
08:41 - it's not really focusing here see if I
08:43 - can get that to focus is shorter than
08:45 - the other so that shorter side is
08:47 - actually going to be I'll show you here
08:49 - again is actually going to be what ends
08:50 - up getting the the positive side or the
08:54 - and this longer side is what's going to
08:56 - be getting the voltage for us so what we
08:59 - want to do is we want to plug in so that
09:01 - this shorter side is in line with the
09:04 - resistor and this longer side and you
09:06 - can just bend it a little bit goes in
09:08 - anywhere else on the breadboard so you
09:10 - can see here now and I'll bring it up
09:12 - nice and close hopefully it focuses for
09:14 - us we go like that maybe maybe we can
09:17 - kind of see it that we're lined up
09:19 - directly with the resistor so that green
09:21 - LED is lined up with the short side with
09:23 - the resistor and the long pin is just
09:25 - plugged into one of these other holes
09:26 - what we're going to do next is we're
09:28 - going to take the the jumper wire here
09:31 - so this male-to-male and we're gonna
09:32 - plug it in so it lines up in the same
09:35 - row as the positive side or the negative
09:37 - side sorry of our LED actually it is
09:39 - positive side because it's going to be
09:41 - getting the voltage so you can see this
09:42 - green one is lined up on this rail here
09:45 - which gets voltage we're gonna go in
09:46 - here it's going to light up the LED it's
09:48 - gonna come out go into the resistor and
09:50 - then go into this orange cable here or
09:53 - so not orange this black cable here
09:54 - which is plugged in to our Raspberry Pi
09:57 - on those GPIO pins so now that we've
09:59 - done that we can actually go ahead and
10:01 - turn the Raspberry Pi on and we should
10:03 - see that our LED is lighting up so let's
10:07 - go ahead and do that and that will be
10:08 - right back
10:09 - alright so I've plugged my Raspberry Pi
10:10 - in and you can see that our LED is
10:12 - actually lighting up there so if you've
10:14 - done that correctly your LED should be
10:16 - lighting up and you should see a little
10:18 - red light on your Raspberry Pi maybe a
10:20 - green light if it's just booting up so
10:22 - that's because we're getting constant
10:24 - power from that five bullet pin so we've
10:26 - been able to turn on this LED so now
10:28 - what I'm going to show you guys how to
10:29 - do is how we can do this from code so
10:31 - all we actually need to do to modify
10:33 - this is we're first gonna unplug our
10:35 - Raspberry Pi I usually would recommend
10:37 - you shut it off before you do that but
10:38 - I'm just kind of living on the wild side
10:40 - and unplugging it and now what we're
10:42 - gonna do is move actually the pin that's
10:44 - giving us our voltage so this 5 volt pin
10:46 - we're gonna move it to a different pin
10:48 - which is known as a GPIO pin which will
10:50 - allow us to control this from code so
10:53 - what I'm gonna do now is then simply
10:54 - take out this one from that back right 5
10:57 - volt pin and what I'm gonna do is move
10:58 - it over so it's up on this top row four
11:01 - pins over and I'll zoom in on this in a
11:03 - second for you guys so you could should
11:05 - be able to see now if I can
11:07 - kiss it focus focus maybe that it's four
11:10 - pins to the left at the top so if you
11:13 - look where that ground pin is one up in
11:14 - to the left and that's what's known as
11:16 - our GPIO pin number four so now what I'm
11:19 - gonna do is actually hook up to the
11:20 - Raspberry Pi on the computer and show
11:22 - you guys how we can program to use this
11:24 - pin to turn off our LED from code so
11:28 - let's go ahead and do that now alright
11:30 - so I've booted up my Raspberry Pi I'm on
11:32 - the desktop and what I'm gonna do now is
11:33 - show you how we can actually use this
11:35 - little circuit we set up to turn on and
11:38 - off the green LED now what I just
11:40 - realized is that these GPIO pins and the
11:42 - one that we connected to give out 3.3
11:45 - volts which is pretty low and doesn't
11:48 - result in much of a light for our LED so
11:51 - if you want what you guys can do is what
11:53 - I've done and just disconnect the
11:55 - resistor I don't know if you guys can
11:57 - see this at all or not and what I've
11:58 - done is just directly hook up the LED in
12:01 - the circuit so that's actually bit of a
12:02 - challenge for you guys see if you can
12:04 - remove the resistor and still get this
12:06 - to work now if you can't put the
12:08 - resistor back in the way you had it you
12:10 - will still see the light light up it
12:11 - just won't be as bright so you can
12:13 - remove the resistor this will be safe to
12:14 - do I've just tested it myself there's no
12:16 - issues so what I'm gonna do is open up
12:18 - ideally from here from our Raspberry Pi
12:21 - and we're just gonna work in the console
12:23 - and I'm gonna show you exactly how to do
12:25 - this so we're gonna say from and this is
12:28 - just a few lines of code here GPIO 0 it
12:32 - could spell 0 correctly imports and in
12:34 - this case LED now that we've done this
12:37 - we're gonna define what GPIO pin we're
12:40 - using to turn on the LED by just saying
12:43 - green which is gonna be the name of our
12:45 - LED we're gonna say is equal to LED and
12:48 - then here we're gonna put for now just 4
12:51 - like that
12:52 - now once you do that now we can actually
12:54 - use the variable name green to turn our
12:57 - LED on and off by simply typing dot on +
13:00 - dot off so right now hopefully you guys
13:02 - can see this I'll I just have it
13:05 - hovering my LED is off now if I put and
13:08 - I hit enter here you can see that my LED
13:11 - turns on now if I want to turn it off if
13:14 - I go on the screen and I just go off
13:16 - like that and hit enter you can see that
13:19 - the LED turns off and
13:20 - can continue to just turn it on and off
13:23 - from code like this now obviously you
13:26 - guys can write this in whatever kind of
13:28 - Python code you want but that's as easy
13:29 - as it is to turn on and off the LED from
13:32 - a GPIO pin yeah if you're having any
13:34 - issues with this chances are you've
13:36 - probably hooked up your board
13:37 - incorrectly or your what do you call it
13:40 - not typing this or you're defining the
13:42 - wrong GPIO pin so go back watch make
13:45 - sure you've hooked up everything
13:46 - correctly and again a little challenge
13:48 - for you guys try to remove this resistor
13:50 - and see if you can get everything
13:50 - working if you can't put the resistor
13:52 - back try it you still will see the light
13:54 - others be very faint so with that being
13:56 - said that has been it for this video I
13:58 - hope you guys enjoyed the next videos
14:00 - we'll get more advanced and there's a
14:01 - lot of cool stuff and a me show you guys
14:02 - how to do
