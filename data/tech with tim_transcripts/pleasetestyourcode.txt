00:06 - thing if you write very very complex
00:08 - code it can be really time consuming to
00:10 - test it so it is a hundred percent a
00:12 - skill to understand how to test your
00:14 - code and more importantly how to write
00:16 - code in a way such that you are able to
00:19 - test it and you can actually catch any
00:21 - bugs before you roll that code out into
00:23 - production so please spend some time
00:25 - learning testing learn about different
00:26 - types of testing like unit testing
00:28 - integration testing system testing Etc
00:31 - and feel comfortable writing tests for
00:33 - the code that you write
