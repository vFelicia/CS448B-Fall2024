00:02 - [Music]
00:07 - hello everybody and welcome to a video
00:09 - that i've been waiting a very very long
00:12 - time to film i'm super excited today to
00:14 - finally announce the release of
00:16 - programming expert now this is a
00:18 - platform that i've been working on for
00:20 - well over six months this platform is
00:22 - designed to be the only place you need
00:24 - to know to learn how to code and bring
00:26 - you to a software engineering level in
00:28 - programming as fast as possible now i'm
00:31 - super excited about this i'm going to
00:32 - talk all about it in this video but if
00:34 - you would like to you can check it out
00:35 - from programmingexpert.io
00:37 - we're doing a 25 sale for the launch and
00:40 - black friday so check it out from there
00:42 - and pretty much everything that i say in
00:43 - this video is going to be on the website
00:45 - as well but of course i need to make a
00:47 - video and talk to you about this product
00:48 - that i've been working on for way too
00:50 - long anyways i'll start by saying that
00:52 - this is in collaboration with algo
00:54 - expert so as many of you know i work at
00:56 - algo expert as an algorithms instructor
00:58 - they've been a large sponsor of this
01:00 - channel and about eight months ago we
01:02 - started planning this product
01:03 - programming expert with the vision to
01:05 - make the best possible place to learn
01:08 - how to code with this product right here
01:10 - as soon as you get into it as soon as
01:12 - you start looking at any of the content
01:13 - you never need to leave everything is
01:16 - quite literally on one single page you
01:18 - can run all of your code directly in the
01:20 - browser you can code along in an ide
01:23 - while watching lesson videos which is
01:24 - really really cool and then we have over
01:26 - 200 practice questions in this product
01:29 - that you can use to well practice your
01:31 - programming skills along with 16
01:34 - assessment questions which are extremely
01:35 - difficult programming questions meant to
01:37 - test if you really understand the
01:39 - content taught in this course as i said
01:41 - i've been working on this for an
01:42 - extremely long time i understand this
01:44 - sounds like a sales pitch but i am
01:46 - genuinely very excited to finally be
01:48 - able to release this and show it to all
01:50 - of you so i just want to take a quick
01:51 - step back here and talk to you a bit
01:53 - about the story behind programming
01:55 - expert why we actually built this out
01:57 - and kind of who this is designed for so
01:59 - the story pretty much goes to myself
02:01 - clement antoine the whole team at algo
02:03 - expert are self-taught developers in
02:05 - some respect so believe it or not at
02:07 - some point in time we too were scouring
02:09 - the internet looking for free resources
02:11 - and while trying to learn to code now of
02:13 - course you can do that there's tons of
02:15 - high quality resources online completely
02:17 - for free look at my channel in fact a
02:19 - lot of the stuff in this course you can
02:21 - find for free specifically on this
02:23 - channel however what i cannot give you
02:25 - on this channel is practice questions
02:28 - definitions assessments and all of that
02:30 - complementary stuff that actually allows
02:32 - you to learn these topics everyone knows
02:34 - it's one thing to watch through a video
02:36 - of someone like me who's been doing this
02:37 - for years explain something it's another
02:39 - thing to actually be given those
02:41 - practice questions and make sure that
02:43 - you know how to do this stuff that you
02:44 - understand the content that you've just
02:46 - learned from the video so really that is
02:48 - the key selling point of this product is
02:51 - that not only is everything going to be
02:52 - on one page for you you never need to
02:54 - leave this you can do everything on here
02:56 - you literally don't even need a text
02:57 - editor ide you don't even have to
02:59 - install python which is the language
03:01 - that we teach but every time you watch
03:03 - one of the videos which i've made the
03:05 - highest quality i possibly can for you
03:07 - then you're going to be given a ton of
03:09 - different practice questions where you
03:10 - can actually apply this knowledge and
03:12 - make sure that you understand what's
03:14 - going on now we also have some projects
03:16 - on this platform so three entire
03:18 - projects where i show you exactly how to
03:20 - build them out these are really useful
03:21 - and some of them are pretty advanced
03:23 - actually to make sure you really
03:24 - understand the stuff that's going on in
03:26 - here so of course i could talk about
03:27 - this for days on end but who this is
03:29 - really designed for is the people that
03:31 - want to learn programming as quickly as
03:33 - possible i'm not going to say that the
03:35 - stuff in here you can't learn for free
03:37 - you definitely can learn it for free and
03:38 - again you can learn some of it from my
03:40 - channel however if you want to learn
03:42 - this as quickly as possible this is
03:43 - really the place to go and this is just
03:45 - going to mean the least resistance for
03:47 - you when you're going through your
03:48 - coding journey because again it's all on
03:50 - a single page and you know exactly where
03:52 - to go next the amount of times i get
03:54 - asked from you guys i learned this what
03:56 - should i learn next i learned this what
03:57 - should i learn next okay i know this
03:59 - what do i do next is unbelievable and
04:01 - that's kind of the main inspiration for
04:03 - me making this course is to literally
04:05 - give you the most guided structure i
04:07 - possibly can in terms of what you need
04:09 - to learn to actually become an expert in
04:11 - program now if you want to look at some
04:13 - more features of this you can go
04:14 - directly to the website we have a bunch
04:16 - of free questions free videos you can
04:18 - check it out and see if it's right for
04:19 - you but again this is designed for
04:21 - people that want to learn coding as
04:22 - quickly as possible and not just
04:24 - beginners if you're an intermediate
04:26 - programmer probably about 80 percent of
04:28 - this content is still going to be really
04:29 - useful to you you might just be able to
04:31 - skip over the first section of the
04:32 - fundamentals and speaking of sections
04:35 - just in case you're wondering we have
04:36 - programming fundamentals object-oriented
04:38 - programming advanced programming
04:41 - software design and software engineering
04:43 - tools as well as those coding projects
04:45 - and i'm still working on this product
04:47 - even though it's released i'm still
04:49 - adding all kinds of stuff to it and as
04:51 - we continue to go through the months
04:52 - this is only going to get bigger and
04:54 - bigger and so if you do want to get
04:55 - access to this i'd recommend grabbing it
04:57 - sooner rather than later because i'm not
04:59 - sure if we're going to have to increase
05:00 - the price if we add a ton of content to
05:02 - this anyways i could talk about this for
05:05 - days i hope you guys can understand
05:06 - where the passion and excitement is
05:08 - coming from i've been working on this
05:09 - for a very long time and mainly because
05:11 - one of the main things again that you
05:13 - guys ask me is where do i start how do i
05:15 - practice how do i get better i truly
05:17 - believe this is some of the best value
05:19 - you can get in terms of a paid
05:21 - programming course this is not like a
05:23 - lot of the other youtubers i see that
05:24 - just release 20 videos and charge you
05:26 - however many dollars for it the main
05:28 - bread and butter of this content is the
05:30 - practice is the editor is the glossary
05:33 - terms is all of that extra stuff that i
05:35 - just physically cannot give you for free
05:37 - on youtube it's just not possible they
05:39 - don't have the implementation to do that
05:41 - anyways i hope you guys enjoyed this
05:42 - video please do check out programming
05:44 - expert from the link in the description
05:46 - any support you guys provide would be
05:47 - awesome and if you cannot afford the
05:49 - course or you don't want the course
05:50 - totally fine i'm of course going to be
05:52 - posting all kinds of videos on youtube
05:54 - and like i said a lot of the stuff you
05:56 - can get for free on youtube just not
05:58 - going to be the same quality that you're
05:59 - going to get in programming expert
06:01 - anyways with that said i will end the
06:03 - video here i hope you guys enjoyed if
06:04 - you did make sure to leave a like
06:06 - subscribe to the channel and i will see
06:07 - you in another one
