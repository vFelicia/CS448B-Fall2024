00:00 - first tip I have for you is to have a
00:03 - goal and actually to have multiple goals
00:05 - let's say you're in a computer science
00:06 - major and you guys are just lazy
00:08 - unproductive you're like oh I don't like
00:10 - this I don't want to do this one of the
00:12 - main reasons you're probably like that
00:13 - is because you don't actually know why
00:16 - it is you're doing this computer science
00:17 - major you haven't created those goals in
00:20 - your head when I'm talking about goals
00:22 - I'm saying something like where do you
00:23 - want to be in 30 years what's the point
00:26 - of getting a degree what's the point of
00:27 - this education you can't work on
00:30 - something very hard and be productive if
00:31 - you don't know why it is that you're
00:33 - doing that
