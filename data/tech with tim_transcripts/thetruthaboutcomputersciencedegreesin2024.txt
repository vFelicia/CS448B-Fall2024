00:00 - let's talk about computer science
00:01 - degrees in 2024 do you need one is it
00:05 - worth it and can you actually become a
00:06 - self-taught developer in today's market
00:09 - now I'm in a unique position to make
00:10 - this video because I actually completed
00:12 - five out of eight semesters of my
00:14 - computer science degree so I know what
00:16 - the degree is like I know the type of
00:18 - things that you learn but then at the
00:19 - same time I dropped out and I was able
00:21 - to land software development positions
00:23 - afterwards I know a lot of people that
00:24 - have gone through the degree both
00:26 - successfully and unsuccessfully and at
00:28 - the same time I teach programming here
00:30 - on YouTube I have paid courses I have
00:32 - free courses and I get emails every
00:34 - single day from people telling me that
00:36 - they've landed a software development
00:37 - position yes even today in 2024 with or
00:41 - without the degree because of the type
00:42 - of things they've learned from me or
00:44 - other resources online for example I
00:46 - just had a student come out of one of my
00:48 - paid courses the one with course careers
00:50 - he landed a job in four months without a
00:52 - computer science degree and that's
00:54 - obviously going to be a bit rare not
00:55 - everyone's going to be able to do that
00:56 - but you can do this with or without a
00:58 - degree and in this video I genuinely
01:00 - just want to give you all the
01:01 - information so that you can make the
01:03 - best decision that's right for you some
01:05 - of you should get a degree some of you
01:06 - should not get a degree but you need to
01:08 - know what's involved before you make a
01:10 - very major decision that is going to
01:12 - impact the rest of your life so with
01:14 - that said let's get into it so let's get
01:17 - right into it by discussing what a
01:18 - computer science degree is not it is not
01:21 - a gateway to a really high income it is
01:23 - not a guarantee that you're going to
01:24 - have job stability or a bunch of money
01:27 - and it is definitely not something that
01:28 - teaches you everything you need to land
01:30 - a job and today in 2024 it's actually
01:33 - not a requirement for a lot of the
01:34 - different jobs that you might be
01:35 - applying for yes a lot of jobs will say
01:38 - computer science degree required but if
01:40 - you have the other requirements a lot of
01:42 - times they will look past that just to
01:44 - give you an example I have worked for a
01:45 - lot of companies where they do list
01:47 - computer science degre required but when
01:49 - they see my credentials they don't care
01:50 - and they still hire me the truth is
01:52 - people want to know that you are a good
01:54 - fit for the job as much as a computer
01:56 - science degree can help be an indicator
01:57 - of that if you can prove yourself in
01:59 - other ways often times you can get past
02:01 - that requirement I know a lot of you
02:03 - don't believe me but I see this every
02:05 - single day if you're overqualified or
02:07 - more qualified than someone that has a
02:08 - computer science degree you will still
02:10 - have a chance for a job even if it does
02:12 - list that as a requirement now with that
02:14 - in mind what is a computer science
02:16 - degree well computer science degree is a
02:18 - recognized credential it's accredited it
02:20 - looks good on your resume and there is a
02:22 - lot of jobs in other sectors that
02:23 - require some kind of 4-year degree even
02:26 - if you're not going to be working as a
02:28 - computer science now it's also gateway
02:30 - to working in Academia if you want to be
02:32 - a professor if you want to do a master's
02:33 - if you want to do anything very
02:35 - theoretical you will need a computer
02:37 - science degree another thing that a lot
02:39 - of people don't think about is that this
02:40 - is actually a requirement for a lot of
02:42 - visas if you want to go work overseas a
02:44 - lot of times you do need to have a
02:45 - bachelor's degree if you want to move to
02:47 - a country like Singapore there's
02:48 - actually a big list of requirements and
02:50 - a degree can significantly help you
02:52 - qualify for some of the different visas
02:54 - there an issue that I'm having right now
02:55 - maybe I want to move to Singapore in a
02:56 - few years it's going to be a lot more
02:58 - difficult to do that because I don't
02:59 - have have this degree obviously it's
03:01 - also required if you want to do anything
03:03 - in the math field if you want to do
03:05 - things like machine learning there is
03:06 - some specific disciplines within
03:08 - programming where it is pretty much
03:10 - mandatory to have this four-year degree
03:12 - because of the type of work that you're
03:14 - doing and the things that you're
03:15 - learning in a computer science degree
03:17 - you actually need to use in those fields
03:19 - now another thing that we can't forget a
03:20 - computer science degree is extremely
03:22 - expensive and that's what I'm going to
03:24 - be getting into in this video What It Is
03:26 - What It Isn't and where you actually get
03:28 - the value because for some of you it
03:30 - will be Roi positive but for a lot of
03:32 - you it will not so now let's get into
03:34 - some very important things that you need
03:35 - to understand about this industry
03:37 - whether you have a degree or you do not
03:39 - have a degree most of what you will
03:41 - actually be doing on the job and the
03:43 - skills that you need you will need to
03:44 - learn on your own you will learn those
03:46 - from online sources you'll probably
03:48 - learn from a lot of different sources
03:49 - whether it be a course a boot camp free
03:51 - educational material textbooks doesn't
03:54 - matter most of what you actually need to
03:56 - know the requirements that will be
03:58 - listed in a job posting you are not
04:00 - going to learn from a computer science
04:01 - degree now this is really unfortunate
04:03 - but computer science degrees are fairly
04:05 - out ofd in the degree that I did I would
04:08 - say about 25% of the material that I
04:10 - learned was actually effective and
04:11 - something that I needed on the job and
04:13 - considering how much you're paying
04:15 - considering how much time you're putting
04:16 - into it that's a pretty low percentage
04:18 - and obviously this does depend on the
04:19 - school and the type of program you go to
04:21 - I was in a very midlevel average
04:23 - computer science program probably
04:25 - familiar or similar to what a lot of you
04:27 - would end up doing or currently doing
04:28 - right now so what you you really need to
04:30 - understand here is that if you do decide
04:32 - to go get a degree that's fine but
04:33 - you're going to need to do a significant
04:35 - amount of work outside of the degree
04:37 - you're going to have to be working on
04:38 - projects you're going to have to be
04:39 - learning Frameworks you're probably
04:40 - going to have to go through other paid
04:42 - courses or material as well as the
04:44 - degree because truthfully most of the
04:46 - things that it teaches are not what you
04:48 - actually need to know to land a software
04:50 - engineering job a computer science
04:52 - degree is extremely theoretical it
04:55 - teaches you a lot of math it teaches you
04:57 - a ton of theory and you learn about a
04:59 - lot of topics that do increase your
05:00 - comprehension and your understanding but
05:02 - they don't directly translate over into
05:04 - the job so yes you may have a better
05:07 - fundamental understanding of why certain
05:09 - algorithms work the way that they do but
05:11 - you still need to learn a lot of other
05:13 - things that aren't taught in that
05:14 - program many degrees are going to
05:16 - require understanding of Frameworks
05:18 - understanding of different languages
05:19 - practical projects or actual experience
05:22 - building software and unfortunately in
05:24 - the computer science degree you really
05:26 - don't learn a lot of that in fact in my
05:28 - computer science degree again only about
05:30 - 20% of what we actually did was coding
05:33 - most of it was math you actually have to
05:35 - take a lot of other courses as
05:36 - well in my case was a ton of electives I
05:38 - had to do that had nothing to do with
05:40 - computer science and yes you do get some
05:42 - value from these topics but we do need
05:44 - to relate that back to the cost which
05:46 - we're going to talk about in a second
05:48 - now another very important thing I want
05:49 - you to understand is that the best
05:51 - developers are going to be the best
05:53 - developers whether they have a degree or
05:55 - not there's certain personality traits
05:57 - that lend themselves really well to
05:59 - being a pro programmer and there is kind
06:01 - of a bare minimum intelligence that you
06:02 - have to have if you really want to be
06:04 - successful in this field now I don't
06:06 - like to say that because generally I do
06:08 - want to encourage everyone to try this
06:09 - if they're interested in it but
06:11 - truthfully there's some people that are
06:12 - never going to be good programmers if
06:14 - you really struggle using a computer if
06:16 - you already struggle with basic math or
06:19 - this logical uh thinking reasoning is
06:21 - already a difficult skill for you
06:22 - truthfully computer science is probably
06:24 - not a path you want to go down and
06:26 - whether you have a computer science
06:27 - degree or not you're probably not going
06:29 - to be very successfully in the industry
06:31 - whereas if we look at the other end of
06:32 - the scale someone who's very intelligent
06:34 - naturally who's really good at logical
06:36 - thinking critical thinking reasoning
06:38 - they're going to be a good developer if
06:40 - they put the work in whether they have a
06:41 - degree or not they don't need one to be
06:43 - successful maybe it will make it a bit
06:45 - faster for them truthfully it probably
06:47 - wouldn't it probably be faster to go
06:48 - through the self-taught route but
06:50 - they'll be good regardless and we see
06:51 - that with some of the smartest people
06:53 - that have become very successful through
06:55 - the tech field Bill Gates Elon Musk Mark
06:57 - Zuckerberg all of these guys were
06:59 - already really good at programming
07:00 - before they got into their degrees or at
07:02 - least during the degrees and that degree
07:04 - is not the reason why they ended up
07:06 - being very successful obviously I'm
07:08 - using outliers here but I'm just trying
07:09 - to illustrate that the degree really is
07:11 - not an indication of how good of a
07:13 - programmer you're going to be there's
07:14 - certain personality traits certain
07:16 - intelligence levels and a lot of other
07:17 - character traits that will indicate that
07:19 - a lot more than Simply Having a piece of
07:22 - paper or going through some kind of
07:23 - program so now we get into costs now
07:25 - obviously we have two costs here
07:27 - financial and time on the financial side
07:29 - pretty obvious this costs a significant
07:31 - amount of money on the very very lowend
07:33 - side maybe we're paying $10,000 a year
07:35 - for tuition plus where we're living plus
07:38 - our food plus textbooks plus other
07:40 - miscellaneous expenses at University and
07:42 - on the high-end side or probably the
07:44 - average side if we go to school in the
07:45 - United States we're paying maybe $50,000
07:48 - per year if we go to a high-end or
07:50 - topend School regardless of where you go
07:52 - you're racking up tens of thousands of
07:54 - dollars in expenses through these four
07:56 - years for most of us it's going to be a
07:58 - minimum of 4 your $50,000 and
08:01 - realistically probably closer to
08:02 - $100,000 and again in the US probably
08:04 - closer to
08:05 - $200,000 that is a lot of money that we
08:08 - could spend in another place if we
08:10 - actually even had the money and for most
08:12 - of us we don't have enough to pay for
08:13 - that our parents are not financing it
08:15 - for us and that means that we are going
08:17 - to have a ton of debt debt is just a
08:20 - nightmare you don't want to start your
08:21 - life with tens or hundreds of thousands
08:23 - of dollars of debt especially when you
08:25 - don't actually have a job or you have
08:27 - absolutely no guarantee I know a lot of
08:29 - you know that but even if you do have
08:30 - all of the money we still need to
08:32 - consider time spending four years of
08:34 - your life at University is a huge
08:36 - commitment and what happens to a lot of
08:38 - people is they spend two or three years
08:40 - there like I did and then they drop out
08:42 - and they don't actually even get the
08:43 - achievement that's something you need to
08:45 - consider if you decide to commit to a
08:46 - degree like this you need to finish it
08:48 - if you spend 2 and a half years 3 years
08:50 - four years and you don't have prospects
08:52 - outside of the degree and you just
08:53 - simply don't want to do it or you're not
08:55 - capable of doing it you've just wasted a
08:57 - ton of money and time that you're never
08:59 - getting back so think about that how
09:01 - many people don't actually complete a
09:02 - computer science degree a significant
09:04 - portion I can tell you almost 50% of the
09:07 - first year class I had didn't end up
09:08 - finishing the degree or switched into a
09:11 - different program beyond that a lot of
09:13 - people aren't able to finish in four
09:15 - years takes the five years or six years
09:16 - because it's too difficult and they need
09:18 - to extend the lifespan by only doing say
09:20 - four courses per semester or three
09:22 - courses per semester it's difficult and
09:24 - now maybe you decide to add on Co-op
09:26 - maybe you take a semester Gap because
09:28 - you need a break whatever all the things
09:29 - that could happen in four years that you
09:31 - can't possibly predict and you're
09:32 - extending this even more and you're not
09:34 - making your first bit of money until
09:36 - you're 23 or 24 years old now that's the
09:39 - time commitment and you have to ask
09:40 - yourself what else could I do with four
09:42 - or five years how far could I get in my
09:45 - career whether it be in computer science
09:47 - or any other field if I didn't actually
09:49 - go through a computer science degree if
09:51 - I gave you four years and I said hey
09:53 - here's $10,000 in 4 years become a
09:55 - self-taught developer I think you're
09:57 - going to have a lot of success in that
09:58 - time frame compared to just going to
10:00 - University and like I said the issue is
10:03 - once you finish this four-year degree
10:05 - now you still need to learn a bunch of
10:07 - extra stuff to actually qualify for a
10:10 - job you have to do all the leak code you
10:11 - have to prepare for interviews you have
10:13 - to learn all of these different topics
10:15 - that weren't actually taught in the
10:16 - computer science degree unless you were
10:17 - learning it while you were doing that
10:19 - and you're equally as unprepared to get
10:21 - a job as someone who's a complete Junior
10:24 - just starting out you might know a
10:25 - little bit more but generally speaking
10:27 - you're non-expert level programmer you
10:29 - don't actually understand software
10:30 - design you haven't built a lot of real
10:32 - world projects and that's just like a
10:34 - lot of the other Junior Engineers so my
10:36 - point here is that if you do want to do
10:38 - a computer science degree it does have
10:40 - some benefits but you better be able to
10:41 - pay for it you better be knowing that
10:43 - this is the best use of your 4 years and
10:46 - while you're in the computer science
10:47 - degree you have to grind a lot to learn
10:49 - additional topics if you actually want
10:51 - the chance of Landing a job when you
10:53 - come out now with that in mind if you
10:54 - have a really clear goal on why you're
10:56 - getting this degree and you know that
10:57 - this actually is a requirement for what
10:59 - you want to do maybe you want to do
11:00 - Master's maybe you want to be a
11:01 - professor sure that probably is the best
11:03 - use of your four years and potentially
11:06 - the best use of your money the point is
11:08 - you really need to factor this and
11:10 - compare it to what else you could be
11:11 - doing with both the money and the time
11:14 - and really genuinely use some logical
11:16 - thinking here and ask yourself is this
11:18 - what I should be doing so with that in
11:20 - mind let's get into my recommendation on
11:22 - if you should or shouldn't get a
11:23 - computer science degree because some
11:25 - people should some people should not so
11:27 - now it's time for my overall
11:28 - recommendation starting for people that
11:30 - should get the degree now if you're
11:32 - someone who's not from a Western Country
11:34 - Like Us Canada UK or there's not a lot
11:37 - of job opportunities in your country
11:39 - that you actually want or that are
11:40 - attainable without a degree I'd
11:42 - recommend getting one specifically for
11:44 - immigration purposes I know for example
11:46 - if you want to work in the US a lot of
11:48 - other countries as well a degree is
11:50 - required or it's actually very
11:51 - beneficial to being able to get a
11:53 - position there so you may actually need
11:55 - one and that may be a legitimate reason
11:57 - to get a degree you need to do the
11:59 - research on that but if you are
12:00 - potentially thinking of immigrating to
12:02 - another place you probably will need one
12:04 - or it will help your chances beyond that
12:06 - if you're someone who wants to get into
12:07 - Academia if you want to be a professor
12:09 - if you want to do a PhD even in an
12:11 - unrelated field or a Ms obviously you're
12:13 - going to need a degree if you want to go
12:15 - into a very theoretical field like
12:17 - machine learning even some data science
12:19 - related fields it will be helpful to
12:21 - have the degree if you're someone who
12:23 - knows you're not going to be successful
12:25 - on your own and you really need an
12:27 - extremely structured environment where
12:29 - you're really committed because you're
12:30 - financially and time committed then go
12:32 - and do the degree for example if you
12:34 - know if you're going to spend one year
12:36 - not doing anything if you were to take
12:37 - Gap year for example then maybe it's
12:39 - smarter for you to just directly go into
12:41 - the degree there's a huge time
12:42 - commitment huge financial commitment but
12:44 - if you know yourself and you need that
12:46 - environment to learn in then maybe
12:47 - that's the best use of your time there's
12:49 - a few other exceptions where you will
12:51 - need the degree but typically speaking
12:53 - the degree is not going to be a
12:55 - prerequisite for you Landing a job and
12:57 - if you are good enough and if you are
12:59 - commed you will be able to land jobs
13:01 - without a degree will it help you yes it
13:03 - will help you a little bit for certain
13:05 - jobs but again remember what you could
13:07 - be doing in those four years that would
13:09 - help you more than having a degree in a
13:11 - lot of cases other achievements that you
13:13 - have are going to carry far more weight
13:15 - than the degree yes it is helpful but
13:17 - again we need to put a value on that is
13:19 - it $200,000 helpful is it four years of
13:22 - your time helpful in a lot of cases I
13:24 - say no unless you fit those specific
13:27 - criteria of course some other exceptions
13:28 - as well as well if you go to a very very
13:30 - high-end school if you have a
13:32 - scholarship if your parents are willing
13:33 - to pay for the entire degree for you
13:35 - then it's a lot easier to do that
13:37 - because then the cost goes down and the
13:39 - value you get goes significantly up if
13:41 - it's just four years of your time it's
13:43 - easier to get into the degree whereas if
13:45 - it's $100,000 or $25,000 of debt or
13:48 - whatever it ends up being it's
13:50 - significantly tougher to make that
13:51 - decision and justify the ROI Sur so now
13:54 - we get into my recommendation for people
13:55 - that should not get the degree if you're
13:57 - very early in life 17 18 19 first of all
14:01 - understand that you have a lot of time
14:03 - now I'm only 23 but 19 feels like it was
14:06 - so long ago for me and I really wish
14:08 - that I would have slowed down a little
14:09 - bit tried to understand myself a bit
14:12 - better and just made decisions over a
14:14 - longer period of time rather than really
14:16 - jumping into them quickly I know you
14:18 - want that momentum you want to go fast
14:19 - you want that first job but I'd highly
14:21 - recommend at least take one year as a
14:24 - gap spend that year really developing
14:26 - yourself learning a lot spend more time
14:28 - in that one year working than you would
14:30 - if you were doing a degree maybe get a
14:32 - job build up some savings and learn
14:34 - computer science and software
14:35 - engineering on the side in one year you
14:37 - can accomplish a ton especially when
14:39 - you're not distracted with something
14:41 - like a degree you can live with your
14:43 - parents and you can really set yourself
14:44 - up for life just in one or two years
14:47 - directly after high school this is the
14:48 - biggest opportunity you have young early
14:51 - in life and I would hate to see you
14:53 - waste it by immediately jumping into
14:54 - hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt
14:56 - and spending four years in a program
14:58 - that you might not finish or that's not
14:59 - going to be the best use of your time
15:01 - again if you're committed if you're
15:02 - motivated if you really want to improve
15:04 - yourself I think in one or two years of
15:06 - a gap you can really achieve a lot and a
15:08 - lot of you can land software development
15:10 - positions in that time you can make
15:11 - commitments in much less expensive
15:14 - courses for example the one that I have
15:16 - is $800 there's a lot of other great
15:18 - options out there but this isn't going
15:19 - to financially ruin you it's not this
15:21 - huge commitment for the next four or
15:23 - five years of your life and you can
15:25 - learn what you need to actually become a
15:27 - software developer and a lot of you can
15:29 - land jobs in that time now if you are
15:31 - someone who's already in a degree I
15:32 - would recommend just sticking it out but
15:34 - understanding that once you graduate
15:36 - you're not immediately going to get a
15:37 - job unfortunately for you you've made
15:39 - the commitment where yes you're now
15:40 - going to do this degree but you have to
15:42 - realize there's still a lot of other
15:43 - stuff that you need to learn and I'd
15:45 - recommend learning that at the same time
15:47 - yes I just added more work for you it
15:49 - sucks you thought going to University is
15:50 - going to teach you everything you need
15:51 - to know it's not you're going to have to
15:53 - do projects on the side you're going to
15:54 - have to learn additional stuff but if
15:56 - you want to be the best setup for when
15:58 - you graduate you need to do that while
16:00 - you're in the degree and hopefully
16:02 - before you even finish you're going to
16:03 - start having prospects because of how
16:05 - much stuff that you've learned so that's
16:06 - my overall opinion I think generally
16:08 - most people should not get the degree
16:10 - but if you have a really specific reason
16:11 - to get one then obviously go out there
16:14 - and get it I just hate seeing people
16:16 - making such a massive life-altering
16:17 - decision so early in life before even
16:20 - trying out the thing that they're going
16:21 - to be doing and also realizing after
16:23 - they get to the end of the degree they
16:24 - haven't actually learned the things they
16:26 - need to be ready for a job so I really
16:29 - warn you take your time with this don't
16:31 - feel like you need to rush into this
16:32 - decision you can always go get a
16:35 - University degree you don't need to make
16:37 - a decision that financially ruins you at
16:39 - 18 years old it's really sad to see a
16:41 - lot of my friends are going through this
16:43 - right now in a lot of other um different
16:45 - degrees that aren't computer science and
16:47 - the issue is even if they make 60 70
16:49 - $80,000 per year they're still paying
16:52 - such a massive amount of debt and
16:54 - they've started life with a negative net
16:56 - worth they're not even at the The
16:57 - Starting Line they're behind The
16:59 - Starting Line whereas if you decided to
17:00 - not get the degree even if you just did
17:02 - nothing you'd still be further ahead
17:04 - because you have less debt right and
17:06 - you're able to move forward you're not
17:08 - climbing out of a hole that you've dug
17:09 - yourself anyways that's what I think let
17:12 - me know what your comments are in the
17:13 - link in the description and I will see
17:15 - you in the next one
