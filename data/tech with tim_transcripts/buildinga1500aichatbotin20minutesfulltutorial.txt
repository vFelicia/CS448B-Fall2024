00:00 - today I'm showing you how to make a
00:01 - $1,500 AI chatot in just a matter of
00:04 - minutes and no this is not just
00:06 - clickbait I actually showed this to a
00:08 - company that I work with and that's
00:10 - exactly how much they offered to pay
00:12 - [Music]
00:14 - me so thanks for hopping on a call with
00:16 - me here just for everyone watching this
00:18 - is one of my friends and business
00:19 - partners from genzone they do kind of
00:21 - Dubai setup consultancy all of that
00:23 - stuff I made the bot specifically for
00:26 - them because I kind of know their needs
00:27 - and I've worked with them before but I
00:29 - want to ask I just showed you the bot
00:31 - what do you think of it first of all
00:32 - what kind of value does it have and if
00:34 - you were going to pay for it how much
00:35 - could you pay me for that yeah I mean
00:37 - since we move hundreds of people to
00:39 - Dubai we get asked hundreds of questions
00:41 - thousands of questions on a daily basis
00:44 - on sales calls just in general on Tex so
00:47 - it would be really really cool to
00:48 - automate something like that to have
00:50 - up-to-date Tech that can always answer
00:52 - questions directly on our website even
00:55 - so I think I would definitely pay uh
00:57 - maybe around $1,500 a month for
00:59 - something like that just to have on our
01:01 - website so that it can reduce some pain
01:03 - from our sales calls that's amazing yeah
01:05 - and I mean this can even just drive one
01:07 - or two extra calls for you per month and
01:09 - you close one of those already you're
01:10 - roing right so that's exactly why I made
01:13 - the butt awesome thanks so much for
01:14 - hopping on for me that was all I wanted
01:16 - to ask you and uh now let's get into the
01:17 - video now this bot acts just like a
01:19 - consultant and can give real world
01:21 - advice on moving to Dubai and egg in
01:23 - Canada its main goal is to actually
01:26 - drive users to sign up for a free
01:28 - consultation meeting where eventually
01:29 - they can be converted into paying
01:31 - clients or to refer them to different
01:33 - accountants and lawyers they can get the
01:35 - expert insights that they need it can
01:37 - capture their email it has a database
01:39 - where it can pull Knowledge from and it
01:41 - can look up real world information from
01:43 - Google and even get access to things
01:44 - like the current weather it's super cool
01:47 - and it's something that you could be
01:48 - making and selling to other businesses
01:50 - quite easily obviously this is a real
01:52 - world use case for a real business that
01:54 - I work with and that's why I wanted to
01:56 - show it to you so with that said let me
01:57 - show you how we build this bot in just a
02:00 - matter of minutes now to make this bot
02:02 - so quickly we're going to use a platform
02:03 - called Coes who have sponsored this
02:05 - video now that said this is really a
02:08 - game-changing platform and it's super
02:10 - easy to create these AI Bots and you can
02:12 - do them in just a few minutes and it's
02:14 - completely free you can even utilize
02:16 - various chat GPT models for free which
02:19 - you're going to see here so in order to
02:20 - use codes what we're going to do is just
02:22 - create a new account so simply go to the
02:24 - link in the description make a new
02:26 - account on Co again it's free and then
02:28 - we'll spin up this bot in a walk you
02:30 - through the process of building it so
02:32 - once we've done that what we'll do is
02:33 - press on the create bot button here from
02:35 - the left hand side we'll select a team
02:38 - in this case I'm just going to go on my
02:39 - personal team and we'll give this a name
02:41 - now I'm just going to type Dubai
02:43 - consultant here and I'll go with
02:45 - tutorial because I already have one
02:47 - named this and then we can give this a
02:48 - description uh which will be helpful for
02:50 - people that are reading the bot and
02:52 - lastly what we can do is actually
02:53 - generate a profile photo or upload our
02:55 - own for this spot so let's go ahead and
02:57 - do that okay great so it generated a
02:59 - pretty Prett cool image for us and we'll
03:00 - go ahead and press on confirm okay so
03:03 - from this page here we'll actually start
03:04 - writing the bot and the first thing I
03:06 - want to do is write the prompt however
03:08 - we do want to select the model that
03:10 - we're going to be using so notice here
03:12 - it has GPT 4 selected but we can
03:14 - actually utilize GPT 40 which is the new
03:17 - one that just came out and you'll be
03:18 - able to use these with various chat GPT
03:21 - credits that this platform Coes gives
03:23 - you completely for free obviously
03:25 - there's a bunch of other parameters here
03:26 - if you want to use those and you can
03:28 - even toggle the multi-agent mode but
03:30 - we're just going to leave it as single
03:31 - agent mode for now now what we can do
03:33 - here with the prompt is kind of describe
03:35 - really basically what we want the bot to
03:37 - do and then we can optimize The Prompt
03:39 - using Ai and it will actually write it
03:41 - in a format that's going to be a lot
03:43 - better for the model so what I've done
03:45 - is just pasted in a pretty small prompt
03:47 - here where I just described what I want
03:48 - this to do and then I gave it some
03:50 - information on the various referrals
03:52 - because it's going to need to know those
03:53 - links for my accountant and for actually
03:55 - getting set up with that Dubai free
03:57 - consultation meeting so now that we have
03:59 - this we'll just press on optimize and
04:01 - it's going to make a new more optimized
04:03 - prompt for us okay great so we have a
04:05 - new prompt here that we can use where it
04:07 - specifies the character it goes through
04:09 - a few different skills that this model
04:10 - has access to or that it should use and
04:12 - then it has some constraints so we'll
04:14 - press on use here and let's just test
04:16 - this out right now before we actually
04:17 - add anything else okay so I'm just
04:19 - asking it here to tell me about the
04:21 - process of moving to Dubai so let's see
04:23 - what we get back from that and keep in
04:24 - mind we haven't added any plugins or
04:26 - knowledge we're just using that kind of
04:28 - Base llm which is GP T 40 so we've got a
04:31 - response now and it's actually pretty
04:32 - decent but obviously we want to improve
04:35 - this model and give it some other skills
04:36 - and things that it has access to so to
04:38 - show you how easy this is with codes
04:40 - what I'm going to do is just add a
04:41 - plugin that gives us access to the
04:43 - weather so if I go to plug-in here you
04:45 - can see there's actually over 300
04:47 - plugins and if I just search for weather
04:50 - here we can find the weather plugin so
04:52 - that's actually the one right here so
04:54 - let's click on that and let's just add
04:55 - the ability to get the current weather
04:58 - so once we add this plugin the only
05:00 - thing that we need to do is just add a
05:02 - new skill here inside of our prompt and
05:04 - just write a few words about the plugin
05:06 - so the bot knows that it has access to
05:08 - it so what I can do is just make a new
05:10 - skill here so I can say skill three
05:12 - something like weather and say you can
05:15 - get up toate live time weather forecast
05:21 - now that's not the best grammar so what
05:23 - I'll do is just reoptimize the prompt
05:25 - here so that it writes it a little bit
05:26 - better for me and then we can test this
05:28 - in real time with the window that we
05:30 - have on the right hand side and see if
05:32 - this is working so I've reoptimized this
05:34 - now and what I'll do is just ask it for
05:35 - the current weather so I'll say can you
05:37 - give me the current weather in Dubai
05:41 - please and let's see now if it can use
05:42 - that plugin great so we've got the
05:44 - weather you can see is extremely hot in
05:46 - Dubai hence why I am not there right now
05:48 - and now let's move on and add a few more
05:50 - features so what I want to do next is
05:52 - add the ability to look up real time
05:54 - information and to do that we're going
05:55 - to use Google search so again I'm just
05:57 - going to go here uh to the plug-in tab
05:59 - there's a ton of different plugins I'm
06:00 - going to go on Google web search let's
06:03 - give it that ability and then again all
06:05 - we need to do here is simply go into the
06:07 - side and add a skill that tells it it
06:09 - can look up real-time information so I
06:11 - just added the other skill here you can
06:13 - see skill four perform Google searches
06:15 - search Google for answers to users
06:16 - questions and then what we can do here
06:19 - is test this out and say how is the
06:22 - flooding in Dubai which is only
06:24 - something the model would know if it has
06:25 - access to Google because this was quite
06:27 - recent and it's not going to be in the
06:29 - new trend TR GPT model so let's see now
06:31 - if it's able to actually use the Google
06:33 - search and find this real time
06:34 - information so you can see here it did
06:36 - now use Google and it gave us some
06:38 - sources and some information about the
06:39 - flooding so this is great but the next
06:42 - thing that I want to do to improve this
06:43 - model even more is I want to give it a
06:45 - knowledge base now this is information
06:47 - that we can provide that it can then go
06:49 - search and look at to give us really
06:52 - context specific and just more detailed
06:55 - answers without having to rely on
06:56 - something like Google or just what the
06:58 - model was trained on and this is really
07:00 - more formally known as rag retrieval
07:02 - augmented generation where we're going
07:04 - to provide a bunch of data to the model
07:06 - kind of like a knowledge base and then
07:08 - when it needs to answer a question it
07:09 - can go search within our specific
07:11 - knowledge so we can answer questions
07:13 - really specific to whatever our use case
07:15 - is in this case I'm going to give it a
07:17 - bunch of blogs and articles from my
07:19 - business partners genzone because they
07:21 - have a lot of detailed information on
07:22 - their website but we could give it
07:24 - access to something like our resume and
07:26 - then it could go it could search through
07:27 - our resume maybe give us tips on how to
07:29 - improve prove it or answer specific
07:31 - questions maybe about a candidate if you
07:32 - were using it to do like an analysis on
07:34 - different candidates you get the idea
07:36 - but the point is we can give this
07:38 - knowledge so I'm going to go ahead and
07:39 - do that so for knowledge I'm just going
07:41 - to go here going to press on text now
07:43 - there is a bunch of different things
07:44 - that we can upload here like photos
07:46 - tables uh various different types of
07:48 - documents but I'm just going to add some
07:50 - simple PDFs now you can see that I
07:52 - already have a knowledge based that I've
07:53 - created but for the purpose of this
07:55 - tutorial I'll make a new one now let's
07:57 - call this Dubai
08:00 - articles just so it's a bit different
08:01 - we'll give this a description just so
08:03 - the AI model knows a little bit more
08:05 - about how this works I'm going to say
08:06 - this contains a lot of information about
08:11 - Dubai and
08:13 - Canada uh that's fine okay we could give
08:16 - it a better description but that's okay
08:18 - and then we can upload some local
08:19 - documents Google Docs notion Etc you get
08:22 - the idea there's a bunch of different
08:23 - info so from local documents I'm going
08:25 - to go next and then I'm going to search
08:27 - on my computer for those documents and
08:29 - upload them here so you can see I've
08:30 - uploaded a bunch of different documents
08:32 - here so I'll just press on next and then
08:34 - we have a bunch of options here we can
08:35 - customize this if we want but I'm just
08:37 - going to go with automatic all right so
08:39 - now this is going to get processed just
08:41 - so that we can actually extract the
08:43 - information efficiently once that's
08:44 - finished what we'll be able to do is
08:46 - have this added to our model and then
08:48 - when it needs to it we'll look up
08:49 - specific information from this knowledge
08:51 - base so you can see now the knowledge
08:53 - has been added as text here and now the
08:55 - bot can start using it when it's
08:57 - answering questions now the next step
08:59 - step to build this out is going to be to
09:01 - do a few configurations on some of the
09:02 - settings we have here and then to
09:04 - actually build in something known as a
09:06 - workflow now workflow is something
09:08 - that's a little bit more advanced that
09:10 - gives you some more control and it lets
09:12 - you do things like send emails for
09:14 - example which is what we're going to use
09:15 - it for there's a lot of other workflows
09:17 - and you can actually just use pre-built
09:19 - workflows but I want to show you how to
09:20 - build your own custom ones so those of
09:22 - you that know a little bit about coding
09:24 - or at least logic can get some more
09:26 - control here anyways what we'll do is
09:28 - we'll go over to m memory and what I
09:30 - want to do is just enable the long-term
09:32 - memory so that when we're chatting with
09:33 - the bot it has access to more context
09:36 - now I'm also going to give this an
09:37 - opening dialogue so that when it first
09:40 - pops up it kind of prompts the user hey
09:42 - this is what I can do and this is what
09:44 - you should ask okay so I've just pasted
09:46 - these in here you can read through them
09:47 - if you want just pretty straightforward
09:49 - and then we have the ability to enable
09:51 - auto suggestions as well so these are
09:53 - like the little suggestion boxes you see
09:55 - down here uh kind of prompting you on
09:57 - what the next question might be we have
09:59 - also can add a background image voices
10:01 - all this kind of stuff uh but from now
10:03 - that will be good okay so now let's move
10:05 - on to the workflows which is another
10:07 - great feature of code so I'm going to
10:08 - press on ADD here and the idea is that
10:11 - we want to build a workflow that allows
10:13 - us to send a summary email of the
10:15 - current conversation chain the reason
10:18 - for this is we can capture the user's
10:19 - email which is valuable to us as a
10:21 - business but also this then puts it in
10:24 - their inbox and it's something that they
10:25 - can remind themselves with and that they
10:27 - can remember our company from so you can
10:29 - see that I have a workflow that I've
10:31 - already built so I could just add this
10:32 - to the bot but instead we're going to
10:34 - make our own now it's also worth noting
10:36 - that there's a ton of other workflows
10:38 - that you could just duplicate and add in
10:39 - here like a YouTube video summary just
10:42 - tons of them and you can publish your
10:44 - own in the workflow shop and other
10:45 - people can use them you can share them
10:47 - between bots so let's go to create
10:49 - workflow let's go send summary email bot
10:54 - I'm just adding the bot here because uh
10:56 - I already have one called send summary
10:58 - email and then we'll give this a
10:59 - description so the llm knows when to use
11:01 - it so I've just gone with sends a
11:03 - summary email of the current
11:04 - conversation chain let's click on
11:06 - confirm and I'm going to show you how we
11:08 - build this out so you can see that this
11:10 - gives us a bit more control and we can
11:12 - start adding in some blocks some code
11:14 - utilizing llms and building something
11:16 - that the llm will then be able to use
11:18 - that's more specific to a use case and
11:21 - we always have a start node where what
11:22 - we're going to do is parse information
11:25 - from the llm question or whatever
11:27 - prompted this workflow to run and then
11:29 - we have an end node where we could
11:30 - return some kind of information or we
11:32 - can simply just end this run so what I'm
11:34 - going to do to begin with is I'm going
11:36 - to go to this end node and I'm just
11:37 - going to remove the output because we
11:39 - don't actually have any information we
11:41 - need to generate uh but we always need
11:43 - to have the start and the end node so
11:45 - the workflow knows kind of when to run
11:47 - now the first thing that we want to do
11:48 - here is we want to parse what the user's
11:50 - email is and we also want to get access
11:52 - to whatever the current conversation was
11:54 - so that we can have that information
11:56 - when we send the email so let me show
11:58 - you how we do that from the start node
12:00 - okay so we're going to begin here with
12:01 - the summary the summary will just be a
12:03 - string and then all we do is describe
12:06 - what this object actually is and the llm
12:09 - will automatically parse it into the
12:10 - correct type so I'm just going to say
12:12 - summary of the
12:15 - current
12:17 - converation okay great now next we have
12:19 - the email which is in a bit more of a
12:21 - complex type because we're actually
12:23 - going to have an array of objects so
12:25 - what I'm going to do is go to array and
12:27 - then select object here I'm going to say
12:30 - email and this is going to be the users
12:33 - email address and then since we have an
12:37 - object we need to specify uh what the
12:39 - object actually looks like so we'll go
12:41 - and click on sub item so inside of here
12:43 - we can specify what type we have inside
12:45 - of the objects in the array we're just
12:47 - going to have a field called email and
12:50 - this will simply be the users email okay
12:53 - so there we go I'm just going to mark
12:54 - this as required and now what we'll do
12:57 - is move on to the next nodes in our ch
12:59 - here where we actually send the email
13:01 - now what I want to do is add a little
13:02 - bit of logic where what I say is if we
13:05 - don't have a valid email address then
13:07 - don't send the email if we do then send
13:10 - it so in order to do that I'm going to
13:12 - go to the if condition and I'm going to
13:14 - add one in here so let's move the if
13:16 - condition up here and let's connect this
13:18 - to the start node and we're just going
13:20 - to zoom into the if so let's move this
13:23 - over here and we're going to say if and
13:25 - then notice we have access to these
13:27 - variables here so actually let's change
13:28 - this to be the string rather than the
13:30 - object and we'll say if this is not
13:33 - empty so this this way the if will kind
13:35 - of work um more how it sounds so we're
13:38 - going to say if the email is not empty
13:40 - then what we're going to do is send an
13:41 - email so in order to do that we're going
13:43 - to have to use a plugin so I'm going to
13:45 - go to plugin and we're going to look for
13:47 - Gmail so we're going to go Gmail like
13:50 - this we're going to import the Gmail
13:52 - plugin and notice we have a bunch of
13:54 - options here I just want to go with send
13:56 - message so let's add that here now we
13:59 - have send message so let's move this
14:02 - over and let's connect this to our if
14:04 - statement so if we do have an email then
14:06 - okay we'll go ahead to send message
14:08 - otherwise we're just going to go to kind
14:09 - of a message block where I tell the user
14:11 - hey you need a valid email so what I'll
14:13 - do is press on message here and what we
14:16 - can do is bring in the message we're
14:17 - going to add this to the else statement
14:20 - and for the output here we actually
14:22 - don't need any variables we can just say
14:24 - here you did not provide a valid email
14:30 - try again okay great so that's the
14:33 - message and then we'll connect this to
14:35 - the end node so that we know that we're
14:37 - finished perfect now from our send
14:40 - message there a bit of configuration but
14:42 - let's also connect this to the end node
14:43 - so we know that we're done after that
14:45 - and what we now need to do is get the
14:46 - content the subject and then we need to
14:48 - specify who this is going to so who this
14:51 - is going to go to is going to be our
14:53 - email okay now for the subject we can
14:56 - just manually type this in if we want so
14:58 - rather than reference we can just make
15:00 - this an input and we're just going to
15:01 - say summary of Dubai consultant chat we
15:06 - could also have an llm generate this but
15:08 - I'm just going to go with something
15:09 - basic for right now and then for the
15:11 - content this is simply just going to be
15:13 - the summary that's it that's really all
15:15 - we need to do now what we're able to do
15:17 - here once this finished save saving s is
15:19 - just test this out so let's press on the
15:21 - test run and make sure this works so you
15:23 - can see here I've just got some mock
15:24 - data so I can go ahead and press on run
15:27 - and we can walk through this in see if
15:29 - it works okay so it gave us an error and
15:30 - I actually know that the reason why this
15:32 - is an error is that the two needs to be
15:35 - of type list and I've actually given it
15:37 - a string so instead I'm going to go with
15:38 - that array object and then I'm just
15:40 - going to test this again which is a nice
15:42 - part of this workflow I can test it very
15:44 - quickly let's press on run and this time
15:47 - it should tell us uh or it should
15:48 - actually allow us to send the email so
15:50 - you can see that it did that and then if
15:52 - we want we can go to our inbox and we
15:54 - can make sure that it was received so
15:55 - you can see here in my inbox I did
15:57 - actually receive this email I just wrote
15:59 - just a test email and the subject is
16:01 - summary of Dubai consultant chat now for
16:03 - you you will need to actually authorize
16:05 - Gmail to be able to send this on your
16:07 - behalf but in my case that was already
16:09 - done hence why that worked okay so the
16:11 - workflow is done now and if we want to
16:12 - start using it we'll just need to
16:14 - publish it so I'm just going to press on
16:16 - publish and you can see here now that
16:18 - it's been published and now that it is
16:20 - published we can add it to the current
16:21 - bot which I will do right now and we
16:23 - just need to specify in the skills that
16:25 - it has access to this workflow and then
16:28 - we can start using it it so I just added
16:30 - the final skill here facilitate email
16:32 - summary and I just gave it a bit more
16:34 - information so I said if requested use
16:36 - the email worklow to send them a
16:37 - summarized account of the conversation
16:39 - in the case that the user attempts to
16:41 - send an email without providing one
16:43 - prompt them to provide a valid email
16:45 - just so that we will actually capture
16:47 - that email before we use the workflow so
16:49 - let me just say hey can you send me an
16:53 - email and let's see what it tells us
16:55 - okay so notice it's asking us to provide
16:56 - the email so let's do that and then
16:58 - again make sure it works so it just sent
17:00 - the email here we can actually look in
17:02 - the workflow and see some of the
17:03 - parameters and the data that it pursed
17:05 - for us and notice that it did send to
17:07 - lifewith tim. official gmail.com which
17:09 - is one of the emails I'm using for my
17:10 - second Channel okay so that's great now
17:13 - that we have this finished or at least
17:15 - in my case this is finished obviously
17:17 - you could add more and make this a lot
17:18 - better if you want to what I want to do
17:20 - is show you how we actually use this on
17:22 - a website and how we deploy it now
17:24 - that's going to involve clicking on the
17:25 - publish tab so let's go ahead and do
17:27 - that so we have a lot of options for
17:29 - publishing this first of all is the co
17:31 - bot store now if we publish to the co
17:34 - bot store which is optional and we put
17:35 - this as private this means that people
17:37 - will be able to interact with our bot
17:39 - but they're not going to be able to view
17:40 - all of the configuration and how we've
17:43 - actually built it so that's good in this
17:45 - case where we have some sensitive data I
17:47 - am going to publish it here just so that
17:48 - you guys can mess with the bot
17:50 - afterwards and we also have a bunch of
17:51 - other options like Discord telegram line
17:53 - Instagram slack all of the places you
17:55 - would probably want to use this however
17:57 - what's most interesting to me me is this
17:59 - web SDK option now this literally just
18:02 - gives you a snippet of code that you can
18:04 - copy and paste on any website and it
18:06 - immediately gives you access to the chat
18:09 - bot it's super cool and super easy to
18:10 - use I'm going to show it to you right
18:12 - now after I press on publish so once I
18:14 - do this it should prompt me here with
18:16 - the web SDK to install this so I'm going
18:18 - to do that I'm going to go to
18:19 - installation and notice that literally
18:21 - all we need to do is copy this code and
18:23 - I can just paste this on any HTML
18:25 - website and immediately I have access to
18:28 - the BX now to prove that to you I have a
18:30 - website that I'm running in vs code on
18:31 - my computer so let me hop over there and
18:33 - I'll add the bot to it okay so this is
18:35 - the website I'm running locally here you
18:37 - can see it's just running on my local
18:39 - Port 5500 just a standard kind of HTML
18:41 - website you can see it's actually a
18:43 - website for genzone I just downloaded
18:45 - their website so I could show you how we
18:47 - can actually add the bot to it and all I
18:49 - need to do is go into vs code here where
18:51 - I have all of the code for the site and
18:53 - at the end of my body tag or really
18:55 - anywhere in my body tag I'm just going
18:57 - to paste in this script and you can see
19:00 - that as soon as I do this and I save and
19:02 - I go back to my site so let me pop this
19:05 - open okay so I just open the site again
19:07 - and now you can see after I added that
19:09 - script tag I literally just copied and
19:11 - pasted it we now have this button here
19:13 - which gives us access to the co bot so
19:15 - it says Dubai consultant tutorial here
19:17 - we have our prompt and then I can go
19:19 - ahead and start asking a questions hey
19:21 - can you tell me the weather in Dubai
19:26 - even though that's spelled horribly it
19:27 - should be able to do that and obviously
19:29 - we can customize this from Coes and
19:31 - immediately all of these changes will be
19:33 - available okay so now we have the
19:34 - weather and we can see the bot is indeed
19:36 - working this is super cool makes it
19:38 - super easy like insanely easy to
19:40 - actually utilize this which is a big
19:42 - issue with a lot of chat Bots that you
19:44 - build you can add this to literally any
19:46 - website and you can start making $1,500
19:48 - or more AI Bots for companies in just a
19:51 - matter of minutes so now the last thing
19:53 - I'll show you is that if you want some
19:55 - inspiration you can check out the CO's
19:57 - bot store now this is a place place
19:58 - where you can get some inspiration and
20:00 - you can view a bunch of different Bots
20:01 - that other people have created you can
20:03 - see that some of them are starred here
20:05 - you can filter by public configuration
20:07 - and the different categories that they
20:08 - have and you can kind of mess around
20:10 - with this and you can even deploy your
20:11 - own bot if you want it to be on the co
20:14 - bot store with that said guys I am going
20:16 - to wrap up the video here I hope this
20:19 - was helpful and it showed you how to
20:20 - make a great AI bot in just a few
20:22 - minutes if you want to check out the bot
20:24 - that I built in this video I'll leave a
20:26 - link to it in the description and I look
20:27 - forward to seeing you in the next one
