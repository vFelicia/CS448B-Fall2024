00:06 - hey guys and welcome to the second video
00:09 - in my numpy array
00:11 - toriel so in today's video I'm gonna be
00:13 - going all over all of the different ways
00:15 - that you can create an array and this is
00:18 - just gonna be without using like text
00:20 - files and i/o and stuff I'm gonna do
00:21 - that in a future video this is just
00:23 - gonna be ways that you can do this with
00:24 - straight code so nothing like reading in
00:26 - or reading out but I will be doing that
00:28 - in future videos so let's go ahead and
00:31 - get started
00:32 - so numpy has a lot of different ways or
00:34 - numpy sorry that you can actually create
00:37 - arrays that's really useful and it makes
00:39 - it a lot faster than doing like embedded
00:41 - for loops with regular lists and Python
00:43 - so the first way is we have this thing
00:45 - called NP dot zeroes and what we can do
00:49 - here is this is just gonna create us a
00:52 - list or sorry an array with the given
00:54 - shape so in this case 2 3 so 2 rows 3
00:57 - columns of all zeros so if I run this
00:59 - and I print X to the screen you can see
01:02 - that we've gotten all zeros here and the
01:04 - default data type for this is a float
01:07 - now if I wanted to change this so that
01:09 - it's not a float and it actually is an
01:10 - int I believe I can do something like D
01:12 - type equals int and then if I click
01:15 - press X here and print this to the
01:18 - screen you can see that we get integers
01:19 - instead of floats so D type equals and
01:23 - you can change that to flow you can
01:24 - change that to string however you like
01:25 - there to get that so the next one it's
01:28 - gonna code with this it's a very similar
01:30 - is NP dot one's same thing we give it a
01:33 - shape let's just give it like 4/5 for an
01:35 - example here click that X and you can
01:38 - see again we get a array filled with
01:41 - ones of the given shape for 5 now we can
01:45 - also give a shape it's multiple
01:47 - dimensions like 4 or 5 3 print that to
01:50 - the screen and you can see we get a much
01:51 - longer array but just showing you that
01:54 - you can go ahead and do that the next
01:57 - method we're going to use here is
01:58 - actually really useful and it's numpy
02:01 - dot arrange and i believe it's actually
02:03 - a range not like as in two separate
02:06 - words so I'll print it out here or type
02:09 - it so we get a range like this and the
02:12 - way that this worked
02:13 - is just like the typical range function
02:15 - it's best shown with an example so I'll
02:18 - do that right now but it works in the
02:20 - same way as the standard Python range
02:22 - function so you see if I print this I
02:23 - get X then down here we get array and we
02:26 - get going up to 10 but not including 10
02:29 - starting at 0 and array containing those
02:32 - numbers which again is really useful now
02:35 - what we can do here is we can treat this
02:37 - like a typical range so I do something
02:38 - like 5 10 and we print this out so the
02:42 - screen there you can see we start at 5
02:44 - and go to 10 but do not include 10 so
02:47 - it's the same format as a typical range
02:49 - function start stop end or start stop
02:52 - step sorry so I go for example let's do
02:55 - 1 to 11 step by 2 and then if I print
03:00 - this is screen you see we get 1 3 5 7 9
03:03 - like that so that's really useful and we
03:06 - can also do it with decimals as well so
03:08 - I'm just gonna bring an example I have
03:11 - on another thing here just to say a bit
03:12 - of typing so we get em Peter Ainge 2 3
03:15 - go up by 0.1 print this then you can see
03:18 - that we get starting at 2 and then up to
03:20 - 2.9 okay the next one is similar but
03:24 - this one is gonna do a bit of math for
03:26 - you which actually saves us some time so
03:27 - this one is called linspace so I'm just
03:30 - gonna say x equals NP the linspace and
03:33 - in here we're gonna type 2 value so
03:36 - we're gonna start out what we want to
03:37 - stop at and then what to go up I believe
03:42 - something like that so let's just give
03:45 - an example here because I think I
03:46 - actually butchered that description and
03:48 - 6 okay so let's just print this the
03:51 - screen to see exactly what says okay so
03:53 - what we do here is we say we want to
03:55 - start at one point oh we want to go to
03:58 - 4.0 and we want to have sorry 6
04:00 - different values in heart rate so what
04:02 - this does is it saves us from doing a
04:05 - bit of math and it's going to find out
04:07 - what we need to go up by to get 6
04:10 - different values ranging from 1 to 4 so
04:13 - you can see we have one one point six
04:15 - two point two two point eight so on and
04:17 - we get six values and they automatically
04:20 - increment properly so evenly so that we
04:23 - can get the value I hope that makes
04:25 - sense it's not super complicated ok the
04:27 - next one is similar to the ones and
04:29 - zeros that we had this one's going to
04:31 - just be a constant and allow us to type
04:33 - in whatever value we want which is
04:35 - really useful as well so say x equals
04:37 - and P dot full so instead of zeros and
04:39 - ones earning full same thing we're gonna
04:41 - give a shape so this gets many of two
04:42 - two and then the value that we type in
04:45 - here is going to be what's filled for
04:47 - the entire array say x equals MP
04:50 - doubtful shape to two with eights and
04:53 - then if I show you we get constants so
04:56 - eights in here like so okay the next one
05:01 - and this is gonna be for some of you
05:02 - guys that know a little bit about linear
05:04 - algebra if you don't don't worry about
05:05 - it because you might be kind of confused
05:07 - on what this is but I am just going to
05:09 - show you so this is gonna give us an
05:11 - identity matrix of shape whatever we
05:14 - give it so identity matrix have these
05:16 - same rows and columns so we just give it
05:18 - one argument which is gonna be rows or
05:20 - columns whatever so this case I'm gonna
05:22 - do five and if I print this so X you can
05:25 - see we get an identity matrix so with
05:28 - our leading ones in the corresponding
05:30 - columns and this can be useful for doing
05:32 - some calculations and you can give it
05:34 - obviously whatever parameter you want to
05:37 - give it right so five six two so on okay
05:40 - this next one and actually the last one
05:41 - I'm gonna show in this video I know this
05:43 - was kind of short is going to be
05:45 - creating a random array so I don't know
05:46 - why you would really want to do this but
05:49 - if for some reason you do you can type
05:51 - NP dot random dot random
05:53 - give it a shape let's just do it for
05:55 - five and if you print that you will get
05:58 - a bunch of random values that are of
06:01 - type float now I just want to test this
06:04 - out and see if it actually works with
06:05 - integers I haven't done this before so
06:07 - hopefully it doesn't crash I expected
06:10 - arguments so we can't act Oh d-type is
06:13 - an unexpected argument yeah so we can't
06:15 - actually end up giving it what do you
06:17 - call it integers like that I believe if
06:19 - we wanted to just convert these into
06:20 - integers we just multiply every element
06:22 - in the array by like 100 110 something
06:25 - like that to give us an integer
06:28 - anyways that's been it for this video if
06:31 - you guys enjoyed please make sure you
06:33 - leave a like and subscribe and stay
06:34 - tuned for the next videos where I'm
06:36 - going to go through stuff like math
06:37 - that we can do matrix multiplication we
06:40 - can do a bunch of cool stuff with num
06:41 - num pie this is just the beginning so
06:43 - make sure you watch the rest of them
06:44 - when they come out later
