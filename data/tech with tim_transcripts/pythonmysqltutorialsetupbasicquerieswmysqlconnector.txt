00:00 - hello everyone and welcome back to a
00:01 - brand new tutorial series on MySQL SQL
00:04 - and Python now the goal of this series
00:07 - is to get you familiar with SQL which is
00:09 - a structured query language that is used
00:11 - in all different kinds of databases and
00:13 - then to apply that knowledge to MySQL
00:15 - which is a popular database that's used
00:17 - by a lot of companies and a lot of web
00:19 - applications and things of that nature
00:21 - so essentially before I go too far I
00:23 - just want to tell you why you might
00:25 - actually want to learn this especially
00:26 - if you're just kind of clicking to see
00:27 - what this is MySQL is usually actually
00:30 - required or a MySQL but SQL is usually a
00:32 - required skill for most programming jobs
00:35 - even entry-level positions so recently
00:38 - I've actually been looking at a few
00:39 - different positions for programming and
00:41 - almost all of them require that you know
00:43 - SQL or you have some kind of experience
00:46 - with relational database systems like
00:48 - SQLite MySQL and the other ones that
00:51 - exist out there so anyways if you're
00:52 - looking for a job I'd recommend that you
00:54 - guys follow along with this tutorial or
00:56 - at least learn SQL on your own time
00:58 - because it is something that you may be
00:59 - tested on and be expected to know or be
01:02 - familiar with for a certain position so
01:04 - anyways with that being said let's get
01:05 - started what we're gonna do in this
01:07 - video is be downloading the tools that
01:09 - we need to actually work with MySQL now
01:11 - an important thing about MySQL is that
01:13 - it's different from some other database
01:15 - systems like SQLite and this typically
01:17 - is designed to run on a server so we're
01:20 - gonna be doing this on our local machine
01:21 - for this specific video and in later
01:23 - videos we'll actually deploy this out to
01:25 - a server and see how to work with it
01:27 - there but just so you know this
01:29 - typically runs on its own computer its
01:31 - own machine typically a Linux machine
01:33 - and what happens is a client can connect
01:35 - to that server and use the database like
01:37 - that whereas a database like SQLite just
01:40 - runs locally on whatever it's using so
01:43 - this is typically in my opinion more
01:45 - powerful and more used in terms of like
01:48 - large applications you typically have a
01:50 - dedicated server for your database but
01:52 - anyways let's go ahead and get started
01:53 - and download things we need to so we're
01:55 - gonna head over to this web link right
01:58 - here this should be able to bring it
01:59 - bring you guys right to it'll leave it
02:00 - in the description now if at any point
02:02 - you're asked to make an account you
02:04 - don't need to do that you can go through
02:06 - this without making one just so you're
02:07 - aware of that
02:08 - so anyways once we get to this page the
02:10 - first thing we're gonna
02:11 - load is this installer right here so
02:14 - there's two options you can choose
02:15 - either one you want I've downloaded the
02:17 - larger one because that means I don't
02:19 - have to wait for this web installer to
02:21 - install the rest of it once it's
02:22 - downloaded and once we have that
02:24 - downloaded we're gonna run through the
02:25 - installer which I'll do right now
02:27 - ok so I've opened up the Installer here
02:29 - for my downloads folder and now it's
02:30 - bringing me to a page that looks like
02:31 - this now here you can choose which one
02:33 - you want from this list now I'm gonna
02:35 - recommend we just go developer default
02:37 - we need at least the server and we need
02:39 - some of the client stuff as well because
02:41 - well we're gonna be connecting to it
02:42 - from this specific machine but developer
02:45 - deep default is fine so we'll click Next
02:47 - let me go here and this is MySQL for
02:49 - Excel we don't need that unless I mean
02:52 - you want that so I'm just gonna click
02:53 - yes ok that's fine and now we have all
02:56 - these things that need to be installed
02:57 - so let's go ahead and click execute now
03:00 - if for some reason any of these don't
03:02 - work you can always reinstall things
03:04 - after I'm with like a previous version
03:06 - of MySQL anything like that so don't be
03:08 - worried if these fail for me the first
03:10 - time doing it some of them did fail and
03:12 - you can go back and reinstall them and
03:14 - I'll show you how to do that so once
03:15 - this is done I'll be right back and
03:16 - we'll continue alright so we've gone
03:18 - through here and noticed that this
03:20 - connector for python failed now we do
03:21 - need to install this but I'm gonna do
03:23 - this a different way so don't worry
03:24 - about that and let's go ahead and
03:26 - continue for now this next button works
03:30 - ok so now we're here and it says do you
03:32 - want an eye and a node database cluster
03:34 - or standalone MySQL server again this is
03:37 - not super important we're just gonna go
03:38 - standalone server as the default here
03:40 - now we're gonna have this that comes up
03:42 - we can just leave this alone
03:44 - we don't need to touch this for now
03:45 - because this is just gonna be on our
03:47 - development computer as noted here you
03:50 - can see that if you're gonna run this on
03:51 - a server you could choose server
03:52 - computer dedicated computer whatever it
03:54 - is so anyways let's go ahead and
03:55 - continue here now it's gonna ask for all
03:57 - this let's just go the recommended use
03:59 - strong password encryption we'll click
04:01 - Next and now it's gonna ask us for a
04:03 - root password now it's important that
04:04 - you remember this password so make it
04:06 - something you're gonna remember now
04:08 - there we go I'm gonna type mine and I've
04:10 - just made mine root so that I remember
04:12 - it you guys can make it whatever you
04:14 - want and now we need to create a user
04:16 - account so I'm gonna start by doing this
04:18 - I'm gonna make the username Tim for host
04:21 - will leave like that and for password
04:22 - I'm gonna make the
04:23 - Timm as well uh what does the password
04:27 - does not mean okay so I'll make it reach
04:29 - it's the password all right there we go
04:33 - and continue on now we have a database
04:35 - user we have our root password and we
04:37 - can continue okay so now this is where
04:41 - we might want to look at some things
04:42 - here so what this is saying is this is
04:44 - gonna run this as a Windows service
04:46 - which essentially means it's gonna run
04:47 - in the background continuously now I
04:50 - want this to happen because I'm gonna be
04:51 - working with MySQL but some of you may
04:53 - not want this so just keep that in mind
04:55 - when it says you know configure MySQL as
04:57 - a Windows service you don't need to do
04:59 - this but it's gonna be easier in the
05:01 - future if you just leave it running in
05:03 - the background now for the service name
05:04 - you can change this if you want I'm just
05:06 - gonna leave this the same and move next
05:09 - all right so now we have these that we
05:12 - need to do so let's just click execute
05:13 - wait for that to finish up and then
05:15 - we'll be good to go okay so that's
05:17 - finished so I'm gonna go ahead and click
05:19 - finish here and then we'll go through
05:21 - and click Next it's gonna say bootstrap
05:23 - MySQL router we don't need to do that so
05:25 - we'll just hit finish okay now we'll go
05:28 - next again and now it's gonna ask us for
05:30 - this one more time so the password for
05:32 - root is gonna be root so we'll do that
05:34 - when it says show my SQL server instance
05:37 - that may be running in read-only mode we
05:38 - don't need to do that I will check that
05:40 - that's works correctly with the password
05:43 - for root which my password was root and
05:45 - then we'll hit next
05:46 - okay now finally we'll click execute
05:49 - we'll go through this and the server
05:51 - should hopefully didn't be installed on
05:53 - our machine we have a few more steps to
05:55 - go through and then we'll actually be
05:56 - ready to start writing some code here
05:57 - okay so next thing here we're gonna hit
06:00 - next again and so start MySQL workbench
06:02 - after setup start shell after setup I
06:05 - don't actually need either of these so
06:06 - I'm gonna click finish but you can
06:08 - launch these if you want okay so now we
06:11 - have successfully installed MySQL now if
06:14 - we want to actually like kind of mess
06:15 - with this and see what it is I mean we
06:16 - can type MySQL first of all there's a
06:18 - MySQL installer which means we can
06:21 - install other things that we need to and
06:23 - we have a workbench and a shell so let's
06:25 - open up the workbench and just kind of
06:27 - explore what this is we're not really
06:28 - gonna use it but I just want to show you
06:29 - that we do have a tool that's able to
06:31 - kind of navigate our database so we can
06:34 - see we have one connection here
06:37 - I gotta type in my password so let's
06:38 - type in root and there we go so we had
06:41 - one instance there now I'm inside here
06:43 - we this is where we can actually type
06:45 - SQL queries directly and then we can
06:48 - kind of mess with the database look at
06:50 - it see all this stuff that's going on in
06:51 - here I'm not really gonna explain this
06:53 - but I mean if you get more advanced than
06:55 - you can mess with this graphical
06:57 - interface we're not gonna deal with that
06:58 - for now though okay so now we need to
07:00 - install the connector for Python know
07:02 - what the connector allows us to do is
07:04 - actually make SQL queries from Python
07:06 - code which is kind of the whole point of
07:08 - this tutorial series all right so some
07:09 - of you guys might have seen that when
07:11 - you installed that your Python connector
07:13 - failed now if it worked properly chances
07:15 - are that you don't need to do this next
07:17 - step so I'm gonna show you how to check
07:18 - so what we're gonna do is just run a
07:21 - Python command inside of like our
07:24 - command prompt that's what I'm gonna do
07:26 - at least you guys can do this from like
07:27 - ideally like wherever you write your
07:29 - Python code is where you're gonna do
07:30 - this anyways what I'm gonna do is I'm
07:32 - just activating my base directory
07:33 - because this is anaconda that I'm using
07:35 - it's not really relevant just gonna type
07:37 - Python you can see that my Python
07:39 - version is three point seven point two
07:41 - it shows right there that's how you kind
07:42 - of check if you're in the right version
07:43 - and then what I'm gonna do is just try
07:45 - to import my SQL now if that import
07:48 - works correctly and there's no error
07:50 - then you have everything installed and
07:51 - you don't need to do anything else
07:53 - but if for some reason it fails we need
07:55 - to type in another command now what
07:57 - we're gonna do is we can do this in two
07:58 - ways for this MySQL Python connector we
08:01 - can download it from the download link
08:03 - that I have in the description and you
08:05 - can pick which version of Python it is
08:06 - that you need so in this case I'd like
08:08 - three seven two seven three five all of
08:10 - that so you can download the correct one
08:12 - and run through that installer and it
08:14 - should install it for you or what you
08:16 - can do is do a pimp command which will
08:18 - install this now I'm gonna use the pimp
08:19 - command and show you how this works it's
08:21 - pretty much just pip install and then in
08:23 - this case we go MySQL like that -
08:27 - connected now wait for this to run and
08:30 - once this runs and installs you're good
08:32 - to go and we actually start writing the
08:34 - SQL queries so again just to recap here
08:37 - you're gonna test to see if you can
08:38 - import MySQL if you can do that properly
08:41 - in Python wherever you're writing the
08:42 - Python code you're good to go to this
08:44 - next step otherwise you need to run pip
08:46 - install MySQL connector or download the
08:49 - file from the link
08:50 - the description run through that
08:52 - installer and it should install that for
08:54 - you
08:54 - all right so now that we've installed
08:55 - everything what we're gonna do is test
08:57 - to make sure that everything's working
08:58 - now I'm gonna provide a few solutions if
09:00 - some stuff doesn't work so don't freak
09:02 - out immediately if something's not going
09:04 - correctly now what we're gonna start by
09:06 - doing is importing MySQL connector now
09:10 - just do this in any new Python file so
09:12 - I'm just doing this in sublight X it
09:13 - doesn't really matter just run this in
09:15 - any Python file you want and make sure
09:17 - that this command works we've already
09:18 - tested this but just you know run this
09:20 - make sure you don't get an error next
09:22 - what we're going to do is try to connect
09:24 - to our database so what I'm gonna do is
09:26 - say DB equals MySQL dot connector dot
09:32 - connect now before I even bother typing
09:35 - the rest of this stuff what I want you
09:37 - to do is run this so I'm running this by
09:38 - just hitting ctrl B in sublime text and
09:40 - make sure you don't have any errors with
09:43 - this because if you have an error we
09:44 - need to fix that so if you run this and
09:46 - you get something saying like there's no
09:48 - attribute connect don't freak out what
09:51 - you need to do is go to the website and
09:53 - install that connector file that I
09:56 - talked about before so I think I have it
09:58 - actually I don't still have the window
10:00 - open otherwise I would show you guys but
10:02 - essentially what I showed before when I
10:03 - said you know this is the Python
10:04 - connector download for whatever version
10:06 - of Python you have you need to install
10:09 - that and installing that should
10:10 - hopefully fix your problem now that's
10:12 - because sometimes the pimp command
10:14 - doesn't work properly when you do that
10:16 - pip install MySQL connector whatever it
10:18 - is so just run the actual file and
10:20 - hopefully that should work and be proper
10:23 - for you guys okay so now that this
10:24 - command is working what we need to do is
10:27 - actually connect to our database now
10:29 - remember I was saying before what you
10:31 - typically end up doing is you're gonna
10:33 - connect to an actual server so different
10:35 - computer all alone now since this is
10:37 - running on the same computer as the one
10:39 - that we're actually writing this code on
10:40 - what we're gonna type here for the host
10:42 - attribute is the localhost so I'm gonna
10:44 - say don't connect host localhost next
10:46 - I'm gonna put the user now again this
10:48 - user can be whatever you want I'm gonna
10:50 - put it as root but you could make it
10:52 - whatever user you created so in that
10:54 - case I made a user called Tim I could
10:56 - connect with that but let's just do root
10:58 - and then for passwd which is just your
11:01 - password I'm gonna type root as well now
11:03 - that was what I select
11:04 - as my password you guys might have a
11:05 - different one that you're gonna put this
11:07 - just in plain text whatever the password
11:09 - was now let's run this again and see if
11:11 - that's working okay
11:12 - that's working we're good we can move to
11:14 - the next step so the next thing that
11:16 - we're gonna do is create a cursor object
11:18 - using this database and execute one SQL
11:21 - query to create a new database so what
11:24 - I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say my cursor
11:27 - and you I mean you can call us whatever
11:28 - you want equals DB cursor like that now
11:33 - that we have this what we can do is kind
11:34 - of curse through the database and run
11:37 - SQL queries and get information that we
11:39 - want so the first query I'm gonna make
11:41 - is gonna be create a new database now if
11:43 - you're not familiar with SQL queries
11:45 - don't worry we're gonna go into detail
11:47 - but exactly how they work but the way
11:49 - that this one works is we do my cursor
11:51 - dot execute and inside here we're gonna
11:54 - put a string which is going to be the
11:55 - query that we want to execute so this is
11:57 - kind of the standard way to do this you
11:59 - say my cursor dot execute and then your
12:01 - query goes inside of a string so in this
12:03 - case what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say
12:04 - create database and this isn't all
12:07 - capitals and I'm gonna call this one
12:08 - test database like that
12:12 - now notice sub-line text is noticing
12:14 - that this is a query so it's
12:15 - highlighting it for me but your editor
12:17 - might not do that so don't worry anyways
12:19 - we have that so what I'm gonna do now is
12:21 - go ahead and hit control B we see
12:24 - there's no issues everything worked and
12:25 - now we've officially created a new
12:27 - database now what I'm gonna do is change
12:29 - my connection option here at the top
12:32 - when I connect to connect to this
12:33 - specific database that I just created so
12:36 - now what I'm gonna do is put data base
12:37 - here is equal to and we're gonna put the
12:40 - string test data base because that's
12:42 - when we already made write so we'll do
12:43 - that here test data base and then we can
12:46 - actually get rid of this execute command
12:47 - like that we can run this and we can see
12:50 - that we don't get any errors so I know I
12:51 - haven't showed you guys much we've just
12:53 - got everything set up but hopefully
12:54 - everything's working here if you have
12:55 - questions or concerns leave a comment in
12:57 - the next video we'll get into actually
12:58 - working with the database committing
13:00 - some stuff adding some things
13:02 - understanding how these queries work and
13:04 - all of that but as always if you guys
13:05 - enjoyed make sure you leave a like and
13:06 - let me know what else you want to see
13:08 - from the series in the comments down
13:09 - below
