00:00 - moment we should be live let's check
00:03 - i think i am live okay so you guys need
00:06 - to tell me i've never done something
00:07 - like this before
00:08 - if the audio is okay if the video is
00:10 - okay if you guys can see everything
00:12 - unfortunately for this stream it's just
00:14 - gonna be one camera angle i don't have
00:16 - like an overhead camera and a webcam and
00:17 - all that side stuff
00:19 - but i think i'm live i think this is
00:21 - working
00:22 - just gonna spend a minute monitoring the
00:24 - chat to make sure we're all good
00:26 - um i will explain how all this stuff is
00:28 - set up and what everything's going to be
00:29 - doing in just one second i'm going to
00:30 - give you guys a second to come in
00:32 - all right i think you guys can see me
00:34 - yeah the chat is saying good
00:36 - awesome okay sweet
00:39 - awesome all right so what i'm going to
00:41 - be doing in this stream is just building
00:43 - a
00:43 - file server so everyone's been asking me
00:45 - like what language are you using what
00:46 - tech stack
00:47 - no tech stack it's a physical file
00:49 - server i have
00:51 - three hard drives these are each two
00:53 - terabytes that i'm going to be putting
00:54 - in here
00:54 - this case which i'll show you guys later
00:56 - actually has room for eight
00:58 - so the reason i'm building this is
01:00 - because as you can see i have my mac
01:02 - i have my big pc and i actually record
01:04 - all my video
01:05 - on the camera and i record all of my
01:08 - audio on the mac
01:09 - so i want to be able to really easily
01:11 - store all of that stuff on the same
01:13 - computer
01:14 - and access it from the mac and access it
01:16 - from the pc
01:17 - also i have probably four or five
01:19 - terabytes of video files
01:21 - currently on ssds on my computer i'd
01:24 - like to offload those and just keep
01:25 - everything
01:26 - on one central server and then that way
01:28 - i can remote into it later
01:29 - if i'm somewhere else and actually
01:31 - access those files anyways that's kind
01:33 - of my reasoning
01:34 - i'm going to go through the parts that i
01:35 - picked right now and i also just
01:36 - mentioned that this is going to be a
01:38 - really casual stream
01:39 - i'm not going to be worried about doing
01:40 - this quickly i'm going to be trying to
01:42 - look at the chat i can see that
01:44 - you guys are saying some stuff here and
01:48 - yeah i'll just be trying to answer some
01:49 - questions and we'll just kind of have
01:50 - fun and just chat and yeah i mean
01:52 - i'm planning on going for probably about
01:54 - an hour and a half two hours depends on
01:56 - if we run
01:57 - into any problems and i will quickly
01:59 - mention that i'm not going to be doing
02:00 - any of the software configuration here
02:03 - i am planning on running these hard
02:04 - drives in a raid array i've never done
02:06 - that before
02:07 - so i figured let's do that off stream
02:09 - and not have you guys to watch me
02:11 - painfully try to figure out all these
02:13 - problems
02:13 - all right so that being said let's start
02:15 - going through some of the parts i'll
02:16 - talk about the prices and everything
02:19 - i've got 279 people watching thank you
02:22 - to everyone
02:23 - uh everyone let me know if there's any
02:24 - problems or anything going on this is
02:26 - like a really
02:26 - strange setup i have a monitor right
02:28 - here where i'm watching myself
02:30 - i've got the camera i actually have a
02:31 - boom mic here that you guys can't see
02:33 - this pc is actually streaming everything
02:35 - so the one down there that you can see
02:37 - the mac is running all the audio you get
02:39 - the point there's a lot of
02:41 - places where things could fail all right
02:43 - so this build is about 900 canadian
02:46 - dollars before
02:47 - tax i need to run a ryzen what is this
02:50 - ryzen 5
02:51 - second gen processor this is a what's
02:54 - the exact model
02:57 - 3400 g it's 4.2 gigahertz max boost
03:01 - 3.7 gigahertz base it's a four core
03:04 - processor and it has integrated graphics
03:06 - now i would have gone with something
03:07 - like a pentium or a celeron
03:09 - but i don't want to go with intel
03:11 - because they're stopping making a lot of
03:13 - stuff
03:13 - for intel and the guy recommended at the
03:16 - store that this would be better and it
03:17 - would just be
03:18 - faster if i wanted to do anything else
03:19 - with this computer funny enough i could
03:21 - actually game on the cpu if i wanted to
03:23 - i'm not going to be doing that but it's
03:25 - good enough i think this was like 200
03:26 - bucks or something like that
03:28 - next i've got a single stick of 8
03:31 - gigabytes of ram ddr4
03:33 - i don't need anything special again this
03:35 - is just a server it's not really going
03:36 - to be like running any applications it's
03:38 - just going to be storing files
03:40 - and then i have a b450f
03:43 - gaming motherboard i would have gone
03:45 - with something lower end
03:46 - but they didn't have enough sata ports
03:48 - on all the motherboards under 100
03:50 - so i think this is about 180 the ram i
03:52 - think was like 50 or 60 bucks or
03:54 - something
03:54 - um and this has six data ports on it so
03:57 - this case actually can hold eight hard
03:59 - drives so i will need like a raid card
04:01 - or whatever that extension thing is if i
04:03 - want more sata ports
04:04 - but yeah and then i have a 400 watt
04:07 - power supply
04:08 - and that's pretty much it this is a
04:10 - pretty bare bones build i also have
04:12 - sorry two fans i'm gonna be installing
04:15 - these are just i took out of an old case
04:16 - that i had
04:17 - and yeah so there's not much to do
04:18 - that's why i figured i'd just get on the
04:20 - stream and we just chat let's do a quick
04:22 - look at the chat here
04:23 - see what you guys are doing 200 for that
04:25 - cpu this is all canadian dollars by the
04:27 - way guys
04:28 - i don't know how much i actually paid
04:29 - for this to be honest with you i just
04:30 - tapped the card when the guy said that's
04:32 - what it is
04:33 - um so i bought it from a store so
04:35 - whatever their retail price was
04:36 - but it is quad core so like i don't
04:38 - think it's that bad and it's a ryzen 5.
04:41 - all right what else you guys saying are
04:43 - you going to be awkward
04:44 - in this to youtube i think you mean
04:46 - upload and yes this will be uploaded to
04:48 - youtube afterwards don't worry if you
04:50 - miss it
04:51 - uh is discord glitched what are you guys
04:54 - all saying here hello
04:57 - okay anyways if you guys have questions
05:00 - just pop them in the chat i'll be
05:01 - looking at it periodically but
05:02 - i'm gonna go ahead and actually get
05:03 - started building some of this stuff
05:05 - so i will show you the parts again
05:07 - unfortunately only this one angle so
05:08 - you're not going to get like a super
05:10 - close up high quality look at everything
05:13 - oops that's a great start smash that
05:15 - into my case
05:22 - okay
05:25 - and another great start just smash the
05:27 - boom mic if you guys can't tell i've
05:28 - never done something like this before
05:30 - this is kind of a new setup for me
05:32 - uh but if you guys have any ideas for
05:33 - what you'd like to see in like say
05:35 - a 24-hour coding live stream or 12 hour
05:37 - coding live stream
05:38 - leave some things in the chat because i
05:40 - am planning on doing that probably
05:42 - sometime
05:42 - in october and a lot of you guys have
05:44 - been asking me about making like a
05:46 - social media website and stuff like that
05:48 - i'm planning on either doing that as a
05:49 - video series like kinda partially live
05:52 - uh where like i don't prepare anything
05:54 - beforehand because a lot of my videos i
05:56 - do that for or i'll do it on a live
05:58 - stream
05:58 - but the only thing is if i do it on a
05:59 - live stream it could be pretty painful
06:01 - to watch me but anyways
06:03 - we'll see but let me know if you guys
06:04 - want to see something like that uh in
06:06 - the chat
06:07 - and again let's just you know keep
06:08 - chatting the point of this is just to
06:10 - talk to you guys and answer any
06:11 - questions and
06:12 - all that okay
06:15 - i like when nvidia pulled
06:19 - yeah so if anyone is just joining in
06:21 - here i as i said before
06:22 - this is like a 900 build or something
06:25 - and
06:26 - honestly could game with this if i
06:28 - wanted to it's nice because i actually
06:29 - left myself a room if i want to put a
06:31 - graphics card in this i can
06:33 - so we could technically turn this into
06:34 - like a low end gaming machine at some
06:36 - point although i don't really anticipate
06:38 - that happening
06:39 - okay so let's use
06:42 - the tip from ltt which you guys are
06:45 - putting in the chat here to use the
06:46 - motherboard box
06:47 - as a open-air test bench now i'm going
06:49 - to take a risk
06:50 - and not test all of this before i put it
06:52 - in the case i've never had a problem
06:54 - i've built a lot of computers before
06:56 - if that happens well then i guess the
06:58 - stream will just be longer than usual
07:00 - all right
07:06 - so this is actually the motherboard it's
07:07 - not as low end as i was planning on
07:09 - getting
07:09 - but uh you know it's just because it's
07:12 - the only one that had the sata ports on
07:13 - the side as i'm not sure if you guys can
07:15 - see it there
07:16 - yeah so this is motherboard decent i o
07:18 - and yeah enough
07:19 - slots where if i want to put a gpu in it
07:21 - i can all right
07:24 - let's see what everyone's saying 400 is
07:25 - really low for cpu plus gpu yeah i know
07:27 - if i put a gpu in this this is gonna be
07:29 - a really low end gpu something that only
07:31 - takes like one single six pin or eight
07:33 - pin
07:34 - or maybe not even any of that this power
07:36 - supply isn't even modular you guys are
07:38 - gonna cringe at the cables but
07:39 - this case when i eventually start
07:41 - showing it to you which i just don't
07:42 - have room to do right now it doesn't
07:43 - have any tempered glass side panels or
07:45 - anything so
07:47 - won't really matter all right let's get
07:49 - that out
07:51 - and let's pull this guy out of here
08:00 - all right yeah so we've got the yeah
08:01 - ketchup and mustard cables yellow and
08:03 - red i didn't even know it was like that
08:04 - but there you go
08:06 - probably not a great idea to hold it
08:07 - from the cables but that's fine
08:17 - the mother boot is too good for the gpu
08:19 - and cpu you bought well i don't have a
08:21 - gpu and i know it's too good
08:22 - but the reason i got it again is because
08:24 - all of the lower end boards only
08:26 - have four sata ports on them and i want
08:28 - at least six because in the future i'm
08:30 - planning on upgrading the server by
08:31 - adding more drives
08:32 - right now i only have three drives but i
08:35 - anticipate potentially adding more
08:36 - and as i mentioned before i will be
08:38 - putting these in a raid array but that's
08:39 - not going to be a part of this live
08:40 - stream
08:42 - all right power supply is here let's
08:45 - actually get the cpu up
08:47 - and start installing that
08:57 - okay here's our cpu not sure if you guys
09:00 - can see that there at all
09:02 - focus focus maybe not okay that's fine
09:04 - we'll show it later
09:06 - and cpu cooler all right does the cooler
09:10 - have rgb is the question
09:11 - probably not but we will see
09:15 - and no no rgb on this cooler when i
09:18 - bought my
09:18 - ryzen 9 which is in the other pc it
09:21 - actually ended up coming with
09:22 - an rgb ish like cooler that had like a
09:24 - ring around it which was kind of
09:26 - interesting
09:27 - okay let's get some of this stuff out of
09:28 - the way
09:30 - and let's go for the cpu install first
09:34 - what's everyone saying what does the
09:38 - server you are building going to do
09:40 - it's just going to store files it's only
09:41 - going to store video files audio files
09:43 - it's going to make it a lot easier for
09:44 - me to transfer files from my mac
09:46 - to my actual big computer which you guys
09:48 - can kind of see the setup for back
09:50 - there because right now i've been using
09:51 - google drive just to send audio files
09:53 - but i have to wait for it to upload wait
09:55 - for it to download it's just
09:56 - kind of a mess and i'd rather just keep
09:57 - it in one location
09:59 - and then all of the video files that i
10:01 - have so i store copies of all my videos
10:03 - even though youtube saves them
10:05 - just in case something happens so i want
10:07 - to have room for the you know 500 plus
10:09 - videos that i have
10:10 - and they're continually just being
10:11 - larger file sizes as i record in higher
10:14 - resolution higher frame rate all that
10:15 - stuff which
10:16 - hopefully you guys have noticed if
10:17 - you've been following this channel for a
10:19 - while
10:20 - all right so cpu is in i guess i'll have
10:23 - to kind of walk you through this because
10:24 - you won't see what i'm doing so there we
10:25 - go
10:26 - and now it is time to put the cooler on
10:29 - now i actually
10:30 - don't even know how to install this i've
10:32 - never installed like an air cooler on a
10:34 - ryzen
10:35 - thing so i think i have to take off
10:37 - these little metal pieces there's these
10:38 - like black bars
10:40 - but yeah do you live in a house or an
10:42 - apartment i have a house
10:45 - uh why are you asking tim how to improve
10:47 - english yeah don't ask me how to do that
10:49 - will you keep up the flutter video uh
10:52 - maybe
10:53 - so you're gonna use raid or unraid i
10:55 - have no idea
10:56 - um are you going to make a stream for
10:59 - coding this
11:00 - yes and also the stream is delayed on my
11:02 - end probably about 20 or 30 seconds so i
11:04 - if
11:05 - you'll notice that when i'm reading the
11:06 - chat but there's not really much i can
11:07 - do about that
11:09 - okay so let's start unscrewing some of
11:11 - this stuff
11:12 - i wish i had set up some music
11:14 - beforehand but then i'll just get
11:15 - copyright striked
11:19 - okay why building a new pc when you can
11:22 - add drives to your existing pc
11:24 - because i want this to be a dedicated
11:26 - server where all it does
11:27 - is just store files so that way
11:31 - i don't have to have a ton of spinning
11:33 - hard drives in my computer
11:35 - i just don't want that to happen it's
11:37 - just going to be a lot easier if i just
11:38 - have a dedicated machine
11:39 - and i also want to do a live stream and
11:41 - build something for you guys so i
11:42 - figured this would be
11:43 - a good way to do that um yeah big shout
11:47 - out to my discord server
11:48 - all the guys with mods with the
11:50 - exception of maybe one or two people are
11:51 - from there
11:52 - you guys can join that there should be a
11:53 - link in the description
11:55 - i'm actually doing these like code jam
11:57 - competitions i'm going to be doing a
11:58 - video announcing the winner of a recent
12:00 - code jam one we did
12:01 - uh pretty soon so yeah definitely join
12:03 - that and check that out
12:05 - okay so these are out i
12:08 - think this should be good to go now i
12:11 - don't know if there's like a specific
12:13 - way to put this on i'm gonna guess the
12:15 - logo should just
12:16 - line up with the other logos i think
12:19 - that's all i need to do
12:20 - okay so that should be good let's see if
12:23 - that fits in there
12:25 - and perfect i think i did it correctly
12:27 - great
12:32 - let me know in the chat if you guys are
12:34 - um
12:36 - what do you call it uh pc builders as
12:38 - well if you saw my channel i did
12:40 - a video building that pc behind me with
12:42 - you guys can see all the lights on and
12:44 - stuff
12:45 - and some of you mentioned that you're in
12:46 - the pc master race but let me know
12:52 - are you going to use linux yes i'm going
12:53 - to use linux there's already thermal
12:54 - paste on this cooler don't worry
12:56 - that would have been an interesting
12:57 - mistake i recently participated in tim's
12:59 - code gym it was dope i'm glad to hear
13:02 - that
13:03 - um yeah i have thermal paste already on
13:06 - the
13:07 - on the cooler i appreciate it though
13:08 - guys yeah if you notice me making any
13:10 - mistakes
13:11 - don't hesitate to uh to let me know okay
13:15 - gotta get this guy down
13:20 - see is that in okay i think so come on
13:23 - get in there there we go
13:27 - let's see what people are seeing pc
13:29 - master race thermal pace thermal pace is
13:30 - in guys i'm telling you i swear i got it
13:32 - don't worry
13:35 - okay
13:39 - and there we go all right so let's just
13:41 - put this into the cpu
13:43 - fan it looks like that's right there
13:46 - now cable management is going to be
13:47 - pretty much irrelevant for this build
13:49 - again because there's no
13:50 - panel right so i don't need that now a
13:53 - question for all of you guys
13:55 - what ram slot does a single ram stick go
13:58 - in
13:58 - uh if we're saying like left to right of
14:00 - the board that's what i want to know i
14:02 - think i know what one it is but maybe
14:04 - you guys can confirm for me
14:05 - we're looking at the board closest to
14:07 - the cpu cooler how many slots over two i
14:10 - guess
14:10 - on yours is probably your left for me
14:12 - it's my right um
14:14 - which one does it go in what distro of
14:16 - linux are you gonna use
14:17 - i don't know i'm gonna that's gonna be
14:19 - after this this video i'm not
14:21 - doing that in this stream that would be
14:23 - too painful i also need to set up a
14:25 - keyboard and mouse and all that kind of
14:27 - stuff all right so here's my ram stick
14:28 - probably the skinniest ram stick
14:31 - i've ever seen in my life i think it's
14:33 - like 30
14:34 - i think it's 3 000 megahertz i opted to
14:36 - get one a little bit faster
14:38 - rather than go with the uh slower like
14:41 - 2666
14:42 - okay let's see this
14:45 - i think it goes in the second slot i'm
14:48 - pretty sure let me look at my other pc
14:52 - yeah okay it definitely goes in the
14:53 - second slot i'm pretty sure that's right
14:55 - let's see if you guys are confirming
14:56 - slot b
14:57 - okay yes awesome correct
15:00 - how many of you go in here 366 people
15:03 - well thank you to everyone for tuning in
15:05 - appreciate it see what everyone else is
15:07 - saying second one
15:09 - can you explain what you're doing in a
15:10 - nutshell sure i am building a
15:13 - file server so essentially as you guys
15:15 - know youtube channel
15:16 - lots of videos lots of audio files lots
15:19 - of editing files just a ton of files
15:21 - and i just rather have them stored in
15:23 - one central place
15:24 - and then also just for a sales fail-safe
15:26 - right like say something goes wrong with
15:27 - my computer i
15:28 - ruined the os or something i don't know
15:30 - whatever it blows up
15:32 - who knows i want to have all these
15:33 - videos saved in one's
15:35 - central place this server is going to go
15:37 - somewhere else in my house it's not even
15:39 - going to be in this room
15:40 - and it's just going to act as a place
15:41 - where i can store and transfer files
15:43 - between my big pc
15:44 - my mac any other computers i have and
15:47 - that's kind of the objective of it
15:48 - that's what i'm doing here
15:51 - and that's the point because when i do a
15:52 - recording i record audio here
15:54 - video on the camera and i just want to
15:56 - store everything even the raw files
15:58 - themselves and the editing files
16:00 - on the uh the server so that's what i'm
16:02 - doing uh
16:03 - why don't you use cloud servers i could
16:05 - use cloud servers i just prefer to have
16:07 - a physical one i've
16:08 - just it's just better i won't have to
16:09 - pay for it in the future i can upgrade
16:11 - to have as much storage as i want i
16:13 - don't have to deal with outages
16:15 - i do actually have a ups uninterruptible
16:18 - power supply that this is going to go
16:19 - into
16:20 - so in theory unless there's a really
16:22 - long power outage this should never be
16:24 - out of power
16:25 - um and that's yeah kind of the point of
16:27 - it all right so it looks like our
16:28 - motherboard is done
16:29 - i kind of didn't even realize how little
16:32 - stuff i was actually gonna have to do
16:34 - here
16:34 - because i'm i don't have any rgb i don't
16:36 - have a graphics card i don't have any
16:38 - like crazy fans or radiator
16:40 - or water cooler um so i guess when you
16:42 - build pcs without the high-end stuff it
16:44 - really
16:44 - goes quite quickly i'm just working on
16:46 - the power supply now
16:48 - and then i'm gonna start showing you
16:49 - guys the case although once that comes
16:51 - out it's gonna be quite difficult for
16:52 - you to see me
16:54 - okay what drives did you buy i have
16:57 - three two terabyte seagate
17:00 - barracuda drives these two are new focus
17:04 - and then this one isn't i don't say
17:06 - older but it was in my other computer
17:08 - and i just pulled it out
17:09 - it has some files on it i don't know why
17:11 - for some reason the form factor on these
17:13 - if you guys can see the thickness level
17:15 - is different i don't i don't know why
17:17 - that is but
17:18 - anyways i don't think that's gonna make
17:20 - a difference okay
17:22 - so let's actually throw the motherboard
17:24 - in first
17:25 - i'm gonna have to clear some space here
17:28 - and then we'll put the power supply
17:32 - all right let's check some stats too
17:38 - 393 current viewers this is the biggest
17:41 - live stream i've
17:42 - done yet appreciate it guys and yeah
17:44 - keep you know asking away in the chat
17:46 - i'm just going to take my time and talk
17:48 - to you guys
17:48 - 7 200 rpm yep i'm pretty sure they are
17:51 - at least that uh what do you prefer
17:52 - windows or
17:53 - apple uh why not ssd
17:56 - because i don't need it to be like super
17:59 - fast storage
18:00 - it's more the longevity of the storage i
18:02 - just want it i mean you could say that
18:03 - ssd is more reliable sure but they are a
18:05 - lot more expensive and if i want to put
18:07 - say you know 20 terabytes of storage in
18:09 - a server it's probably not realistic
18:11 - that i'm gonna do that with ssds
18:13 - um i could but it's just kind of more
18:15 - expensive than i really
18:16 - want to uh to get into here especially
18:19 - for what i'm using this for
18:21 - all right i will sit down in a moment so
18:23 - you guys can see me but
18:24 - just gotta get this case going
18:31 - all right i would love you know what
18:33 - i'll show you guys the
18:34 - case like this maybe and
18:37 - you guys can kind of get an idea of what
18:39 - it looks like on the inside let me know
18:40 - if that's a decent view
18:42 - there you go see look at all the heart
18:43 - oops look at all the hard drive bays
18:45 - it has eight bays that's why i went with
18:47 - this case it was kind of expensive but
18:49 - i think it'll be worth it for sure and
18:50 - it doesn't actually look that bad
18:52 - but as i mentioned no tempered glass or
18:55 - anything like that
18:57 - okay so let's get out all these parts
18:59 - oops
19:01 - like they're stuck in here all right
19:05 - screws
19:06 - sweet what are you saying raid allows
19:08 - for multiple disk use
19:10 - yep that is correct what's the name of
19:12 - the case
19:13 - uh this is a fractal design
19:17 - something i don't let's see if it says
19:20 - here
19:22 - fractal design no it's not giving me the
19:24 - model
19:25 - i have it somewhere remind me later and
19:27 - maybe i'll get it thank you guys like
19:28 - the case i'm glad
19:30 - use arch linux why do you have a
19:32 - computer case you can use little ones
19:35 - i don't quite understand that can you
19:37 - please do a unity tutorial maybe the
19:39 - chair is comfortable
19:40 - for entire day work yeah the chair is
19:41 - great i love this chair
19:47 - all right time to put this motherboard
19:49 - [Music]
19:50 - in
19:52 - and there we go
19:55 - i think let's make sure that's in
20:05 - okay ah and another rookie mistake
20:10 - didn't put in the motherboard standoffs
20:12 - that's gonna be something that we're
20:13 - definitely gonna want
20:15 - all right where did i put them now is
20:16 - the question i have them somewhere
20:18 - okay zip ties are here and
20:22 - they should be in here motherboards
20:24 - stand off great see usually they come
20:25 - with the motherboard standoff i was
20:27 - wondering why my motherboard was flexing
20:28 - so hard in the case
20:30 - that would have been interesting okay so
20:32 - these are
20:33 - some rubber thing
20:37 - let's see and a big bag of screws
20:41 - yay okay
20:47 - did you consider trying a linux distro
20:49 - as your main os i have dual boot on my
20:51 - computer with an ubuntu uh distribution
20:53 - as well as windows
20:54 - i just record on windows because most of
20:56 - you guys use windows i can
20:58 - look in my stats and see what you guys
20:59 - use and it's usually easier to explain
21:01 - to someone how to do something on
21:03 - windows
21:04 - um linux is good i would use it like i
21:07 - prefer using linux in a lot of
21:08 - situations but
21:09 - i find that if you're on linux you
21:11 - already kind of know what you're doing
21:12 - you don't really need me
21:14 - to to give you as many tutorials i don't
21:16 - know like that many beginners that start
21:18 - with linux
21:19 - now i'm wondering if i just put these in
21:21 - by hand i used i had this tool in my
21:23 - other case that like let me screw these
21:25 - in
21:26 - i'm not seeing it here but maybe i'll
21:27 - give it a second look
21:29 - um just in case that is a
21:32 - thing yeah i don't think it comes with
21:36 - one of those i'm just going to put
21:37 - it in uh you're missing i o shield the
21:39 - io shield is automatically on the thing
21:41 - beneath donated let's see donations oh
21:45 - someone donated two bucks thanks for the
21:47 - great videos good luck with the pc
21:48 - appreciate it man
21:50 - appreciate it i did not see that i
21:51 - apologize please let me know if people
21:54 - are
21:54 - donating as i'm looking on not my
21:56 - streaming computer so it doesn't like
21:58 - show me all the history
22:00 - um are you going to transfer the files
22:02 - using a cable
22:03 - well yeah it's going to be over the
22:04 - network so what graphics start no
22:06 - graphics card
22:07 - um what's your preference flutter or
22:11 - react
22:12 - native um i don't really have a
22:14 - preference i haven't used react native
22:16 - enough to know
22:18 - all right let's get these screws in
22:21 - ah there we go that's better now the
22:23 - question is where do the standoff screws
22:25 - go
22:26 - on a full atx board
22:30 - why don't you use dual channel memory
22:31 - it's better for ryzen
22:33 - that's fine maybe i'll buy another 8 gig
22:34 - stick another time
22:36 - again this is not meant to be a
22:37 - performance based pc the hardware i have
22:39 - is already overkill for what i'm using
22:41 - it for
22:42 - it's just really just going to store
22:44 - files that's that's literally the goal i
22:46 - already spent more money than i was
22:47 - hoping to spend
22:48 - but that's fine it's just what i needed
22:51 - because i needed a
22:52 - cpu that has integrated graphics but i
22:54 - don't want an intel cpu
22:56 - okay let's go in here
23:00 - do you still work at microsoft i'm gonna
23:03 - be going back
23:04 - next summer but currently i'm not
23:05 - working there it was only for 12 weeks
23:08 - in the summer when i posted that video
23:10 - on my youtube channel that was pretty
23:11 - much the end of my
23:12 - internship see what else you guys asking
23:16 - tim choose a bad time to start streaming
23:18 - because we're watching the ps5 event
23:20 - oops um use correct
23:24 - standoffs yeah i'm using the i'm using
23:26 - the right ones uh i think
23:28 - maybe we'll see okay
23:31 - ah it's helpful this is a label that has
23:33 - a everywhere
23:35 - shows me where to put these okay
23:38 - atx great
23:42 - all right standoff last one going in how
23:50 - to make a computer tutorial
23:51 - this will be the closest thing i do to
23:53 - how to make a computer tutorial follow
23:55 - along closely if you want to learn
23:57 - okay one of these standoffs is not
23:59 - screwing
24:00 - in all the way i think i can probably
24:03 - afford to
24:04 - not put one in but it's gonna like kind
24:06 - of be sagging in that corner
24:08 - oh wait aha
24:11 - this is the tool i was looking for there
24:13 - is one of these tools in here to screw
24:15 - the stand-ups in
24:16 - great it's good to see all right
24:19 - if you want some recommendations on raid
24:20 - or other questions you have about
24:22 - ssd cash from i can answer some of them
24:24 - a few very important when building a
24:25 - fires
24:26 - for sure definitely great well i don't
24:28 - have any questions off the top of my
24:29 - head but what raid configuration would
24:31 - you uh
24:32 - recommend then if you uh if you know 900
24:34 - canadian dollars or 684 usd
24:37 - well that would be the same thing now um
24:39 - why don't you just buy more storage to
24:41 - your current pc
24:42 - because i it's going to be i just want
24:45 - to have a separate thing essentially
24:46 - like
24:46 - a fail safe you know and then that way
24:49 - say i move my pc somewhere
24:50 - it just it's better to have a separate
24:53 - computer for this and i can have like
24:54 - say 20 terabytes of storage whereas on
24:57 - my computer
24:58 - i could put that but i don't really want
24:59 - spinning hard drives everywhere the
25:01 - noise the extra latency all that stuff i
25:03 - don't i don't want that on my main
25:05 - computer
25:05 - i'd rather have a processor handling all
25:07 - of the
25:08 - almost think of this as like a database
25:10 - right why not run a database on your um
25:12 - you know ui side if you're having a
25:14 - website well it's just better to have it
25:16 - separately right
25:17 - um is it necessary to learn about
25:19 - hardware before you're doing
25:20 - i've built a lot of computers before so
25:22 - i have a pretty good idea i've never
25:23 - built a server before though so this is
25:25 - kind of a new thing and
25:27 - there'll be some interesting points when
25:29 - i started
25:30 - getting to the software stuff because i
25:31 - have no idea what it's supposed to do
25:33 - uh what are you doing uh you should put
25:36 - it in the description what are you
25:37 - saying
25:38 - i want to donate again uh
25:42 - i said hi i think use raid two for three
25:45 - disk use raid five
25:47 - does someone want to describe the
25:48 - difference between raid two and raid
25:49 - five so i know which one to pick
25:54 - all right okay standoffs are in that was
25:58 - a bit of a rookie mistake let's put this
26:00 - in now
26:06 - ah that's much better okay now it's
26:08 - actually sitting in there properly
26:10 - for everyone asking about i o shield io
26:11 - shield is already
26:13 - installed it's on the actual motherboard
26:15 - i don't need to put one in
26:17 - our deep learning strong math knowledge
26:21 - um if you want to understand everything
26:24 - yes
26:25 - but not just if uh you want to be able
26:27 - to do it you don't need to
26:29 - be a master at math to do deep learning
26:31 - if you want to understand what you're
26:33 - doing
26:33 - then you should be decent at math now
26:37 - they never label these screw bags so i
26:38 - never know which one is which i'm going
26:40 - to assume
26:42 - that these are for the motherboard i
26:44 - know you guys can't really see those
26:46 - let's see take care from static
26:49 - electricity can kill your motherboard
26:50 - i'm not wearing socks i am on carpet
26:53 - right now actually if you guys can tell
26:55 - um and i'm not wearing socks for that
26:57 - purpose because i don't want to generate
26:58 - any electric
26:59 - my feet are actually not touching the
27:01 - ground a lot of times in this chair
27:03 - okay and motherboard is going in
27:06 - message deleted thank you moderators uh
27:09 - raid2 is both this basically store the
27:11 - same used for redundancy
27:13 - if you want to learn but okay let's see
27:16 - have you ever done any game development
27:18 - not really
27:20 - other than the python stuff i've shown
27:22 - you
27:24 - see what else you guys are saying can't
27:27 - really use raid 2 with three disks
27:29 - yeah if i need to get another disk
27:31 - that's totally uh
27:32 - i can totally do that if that makes more
27:35 - sense for whatever the raid
27:36 - configuration is
27:37 - i thought three would be enough just
27:39 - because i don't really need more than
27:40 - six terabytes of storage at least
27:42 - right now but in the future i'll
27:44 - probably need maybe
27:45 - 10 and then in the way future if i'm
27:48 - filming stuff in 4k
27:49 - probably like 20. um
27:52 - the great thing with this too is that i
27:53 - can give other access people to server
27:55 - if i set up with like you know vnc and
27:57 - stuff so they can steal files i have
27:59 - editors actually that i work with and i
28:01 - just prefer they can probably strip
28:03 - stuff off the server rather than just
28:04 - google drive too
28:05 - if i set up on the network correctly
28:07 - obviously someone can tell me if that's
28:08 - not right but that's kind of what i'm
28:10 - thinking of
28:11 - such a bad idea deal with screws on the
28:13 - carpet
28:14 - yeah i'm aware but i don't really have
28:16 - another option
28:17 - i've never had a problem with static
28:18 - though i think that's you know it
28:20 - definitely is
28:21 - an issue but i don't think it's as big
28:22 - of a problem now with the type of
28:24 - components
28:25 - we have maybe in the past okay almost
28:28 - motherboard is almost in
28:33 - one more screw use raid 5
28:37 - or raid 10 rate 10 is faster than 5 and
28:40 - best choice 4 and best choice for file
28:44 - server
28:45 - um esd is a myth tim where are my 4k
28:49 - videos i have a 4k camera it just
28:51 - doesn't do it in 60 fps
28:53 - so if you guys are okay watching me in
28:54 - 30 then maybe i'll start posting 4k
28:57 - but i think it's a little unnecessary to
28:58 - do 4k for what i'm doing right now but
29:00 - you know maybe
29:01 - as the channel continues to grow we'll
29:03 - move our way up there okay
29:05 - motherboard is in so i don't need that
29:07 - box
29:08 - anymore now i'm going to go power supply
29:11 - and yeah i guess we'll just keep moving
29:13 - this is going a lot faster than i
29:14 - thought it was gonna nice looking case
29:15 - thank you guys appreciate it
29:17 - um let's do some i forgot i gotta do all
29:21 - the front connectors too that'll be a
29:23 - later problem
29:24 - when we do a little cable management
29:26 - here the nice thing about this case too
29:28 - is it has this like
29:29 - sound insulation in it so it's really
29:31 - perfect for what i'm doing because i'm
29:32 - not going to hear all the spinning hard
29:33 - drives
29:34 - uh and this like horrible cooler that's
29:36 - on here
29:37 - that i imagine will well if it's under
29:39 - load be fairly loud
29:41 - okay well i might hear it but it won't
29:43 - be as loud as it otherwise
29:44 - would be okay so fan this is the power
29:47 - supply
29:48 - really this is a 400 watt power supply
29:50 - it's the evga bronze it's
29:52 - not anything special maybe i should have
29:54 - gotten something better but whatever
29:55 - that's fine
29:56 - does it have a pci ah it does it does
29:59 - have a pci connector so i actually can
30:00 - connect a graphics card
30:02 - okay
30:07 - all right there we go
30:11 - and let's screw this guy in now okay
30:25 - some reason it's not fitting quite mesh
30:28 - on here
30:31 - quite flush is the word i'm wanting to
30:32 - look for let's see
30:37 - okay i think we should be good all right
30:40 - let's see
30:41 - how are you going to send the files it's
30:42 - just going to be over the network i have
30:44 - a pr
30:44 - like the internal network will be quick
30:46 - i also will have uh
30:48 - i can run a cable to it if i need to
30:49 - because these won't be like too far
30:51 - apart
30:51 - and i have cables run all through my
30:53 - house like for ethernet jacks and all
30:55 - that kind of stuff
30:56 - um that'll be a later problem though
30:58 - once we get this
30:59 - this pc setup uh how are you going to
31:02 - send files yeah someone's asking that
31:05 - uh i'm gonna go to sleep see you later
31:08 - 2 30 a.m here wow if you guys are here
31:10 - at 2 30
31:12 - i guess i got to say thank you uh
31:15 - where's my power supply screws
31:18 - have those somewhere this is the problem
31:20 - when you have so much stuff
31:22 - i think i put them here perfect
31:27 - can you do a neural network tutorial i
31:29 - already have one do you like competitive
31:31 - programming
31:32 - um yes and no i like solving programming
31:34 - problems it's a little bit stressful
31:36 - when you put it in
31:37 - the competitive environment and you're
31:38 - going against guys where that's that's
31:40 - all they do
31:41 - um so not really a huge into the
31:43 - competitive aspect but i like that type
31:45 - of programming i think that's kind of
31:46 - fun
31:48 - um let's see what you guys are saying i
31:50 - recommend
31:51 - samba as ftp on ubuntu sure where do you
31:54 - get that shirt tim
31:54 - link in description this is a part of
31:57 - the tech with tim
31:58 - merchandise i don't really talk about it
32:00 - very much but if you guys want like
32:01 - python related
32:03 - t-shirts and stuff i have some stuff
32:04 - that i think looks decent i wear it in
32:06 - most of the videos
32:08 - you guys probably noticed uh it also is
32:10 - pinned in i pin yeah i actually pinned
32:12 - this exact shirt in the live stream chat
32:14 - uh what are you guys saying what's your
32:16 - favorite part of the microsoft
32:17 - internship
32:19 - favorite part was probably just getting
32:20 - to see how large scale software
32:22 - actually is built because i've only ever
32:24 - really done stuff in like small teams
32:26 - or with like you know you know a few
32:28 - other people or just by myself
32:30 - whereas this i was dealing with a code
32:32 - base that was like you know close to a
32:33 - million lines of code so it's
32:34 - interesting to see kind of all the
32:36 - legacy aspects of it how you maintain
32:38 - that
32:38 - and just a different side of you know
32:40 - software development that i never would
32:41 - have been exposed to otherwise
32:43 - okay power supply is in
32:46 - i guess all that's left to do now is
32:48 - drives i have enough sata cables
32:51 - and then just all the connectors which
32:52 - obviously will be the longest part
32:54 - um let's see what everyone's saying here
32:58 - you inspired me to code made youtube
33:00 - videos
33:04 - let's see what everyone's saying here
33:06 - all right nothing meaningful to answer
33:08 - you guys are just chatting among
33:10 - yourselves okay
33:12 - so let me start can you guys see this at
33:14 - all when i when i tilt this case i don't
33:16 - know if you can see this or not but
33:18 - uh it's too bad if you can't now what
33:21 - let's take off the back
33:22 - side and that would be a good time to do
33:24 - that
33:26 - and i guess this guy will give you guys
33:28 - an idea of the size of this case
33:35 - what software that's that's a later
33:38 - story i just figured
33:39 - i literally bought the parts for this
33:40 - computer about an hour ago
33:43 - and then i was like you know what let's
33:44 - just build this on a live stream i can
33:45 - chat with you guys
33:46 - i thought it would be fun and then i was
33:48 - gonna figure out all that software stuff
33:50 - afterwards
33:51 - okay so
33:55 - lots of fan headers this is actually a
33:57 - great case this is a i'm impressed by
33:59 - this
34:00 - i didn't realize it was going to be this
34:01 - good okay let's start uninstalling the
34:03 - stuff i don't need
34:05 - don't need this disk drive okay come on
34:09 - get out of here that's stuck up in the
34:11 - top yeah oh you guys can actually see
34:12 - this pretty well
34:13 - okay awesome glad to see
34:18 - uh oh someone's asking about the checker
34:20 - tutorial series so i'm doing a
34:22 - checkers tutorial series right now as
34:23 - you guys know the ai
34:25 - aspect of that will be out near the end
34:27 - of this month um
34:29 - it is finished but it's just kind of in
34:30 - the queue i have some other stuff that i
34:32 - need to do first okay
34:34 - [Music]
34:38 - now i have a new appreciation for guys
34:40 - that build pcs on
34:41 - on the camera because this is a lot more
34:43 - difficult than it looks to get
34:44 - everything in
34:44 - shot and all this okay there we go
34:48 - unscrew that
34:51 - what processor this is a ryzen 5 3 400
34:56 - g yeah i think g is the one because it
34:59 - has a
35:01 - graphics not card i guess but unit in it
35:03 - or whatever
35:04 - whatever you want to call that
35:06 - processing unit
35:08 - okay just trying to take out this drive
35:10 - thing here
35:17 - uh i also want to work on vs code
35:21 - like you worked on your internship how
35:22 - can i get started well it is an open
35:24 - source project so technically you could
35:25 - go
35:26 - look at some issues in the repository
35:29 - and just put up some
35:30 - pull requests you'll probably get a lot
35:32 - of feedback but
35:34 - at least that would be a good way to get
35:35 - started if you want to do that
35:42 - thank you so much for the effort in this
35:44 - channel i would don't know where i'd be
35:45 - without the
35:46 - coding journey i'm butchering that well
35:48 - you're welcome
35:50 - can you get a referral microsoft i have
35:51 - a good experience sorry i can't just
35:53 - refer
35:54 - a live stream viewer i don't even know
35:56 - how i would refer someone to be quite
35:58 - honest with you
35:59 - that wasn't something that was like
36:00 - mentioned to me
36:05 - how many people we got watching right
36:06 - now 375 oh
36:09 - all right so 375 it shows me on my
36:11 - youtube on the actual thing that says
36:12 - 393.
36:14 - awesome well thank you everyone for
36:16 - checking this out
36:17 - how why will this not come come on how
36:20 - would they expect me to do this
36:23 - all right so i have this like
36:26 - drive bay thing i'm trying to pull out
36:28 - but it's really not being very
36:31 - cooperative okay i think i'm gonna have
36:33 - to actually do this
36:41 - have you ever considered any hardware
36:43 - stuff like on the channel
36:44 - this is as much hardware stuff as i'm
36:46 - gonna do look
36:47 - drive yay um there we go
36:51 - that's how we get that out i did have to
36:52 - take that out okay this was just for
36:54 - like a disc drive which i don't need
36:57 - throw that there okay
37:06 - and come on how do you slide in
37:10 - like that perfect all right this is
37:13 - actually a great case i'm really loving
37:14 - this case i didn't even
37:15 - really look at it that much before i
37:17 - bought it
37:19 - but i'm happy i did
37:23 - most of my co-workers use windows or
37:24 - linux uh i feel like it's risky to
37:27 - answer this question but a lot of them
37:28 - actually use
37:29 - mac a lot of people do use windows
37:31 - obviously
37:32 - some people use linux but like most of
37:34 - them actually were using mac
37:36 - which is fun um okay come on
37:39 - screw go in
37:47 - all right there we go hi tim love your
37:49 - tutorials keep up the grind
37:50 - appreciate it how many satya slots my
37:53 - motherboard has six
37:54 - sata slots i believe i can get like an
37:57 - expansion card or something in the
37:58 - future but that's why i went with just a
38:00 - little bit of a higher end motherboard
38:02 - just to avoid that extra cost for some
38:04 - adapter i don't know what that would be
38:07 - but i figured if it has six slots that's
38:09 - better than four which a lot of the
38:10 - other ones did
38:11 - why not use a route mac so i don't have
38:14 - a server rack or i do but i
38:15 - won't if i move this somewhere else
38:18 - which i probably will
38:19 - so i didn't want to go with a rack
38:21 - mounted server thing i also just kind of
38:23 - had this idea
38:24 - today and i was like let's just
38:26 - livestream i have time um
38:28 - and i just went out and literally bought
38:29 - these parts right before i did this so
38:31 - it was a pretty like
38:32 - spur of the moment decision but i have a
38:34 - general idea what i'm doing so i think
38:36 - i think we should be good okay so this
38:39 - is
38:40 - not what i want let's pull this through
38:44 - i want to show you guys the cable
38:45 - management i will after but i do need to
38:47 - have it turned
38:47 - this way for right now okay
38:51 - this is cpu
38:55 - there and sata great
38:58 - these are gonna have to go over here
39:01 - okay
39:05 - oh i don't know why they make these
39:07 - cables these colors it doesn't make any
39:09 - sense to me just keep them like a black
39:10 - color
39:11 - just they just look so bad all these
39:13 - multi colors
39:14 - okay
39:19 - what os will you install which specific
39:21 - flavor
39:22 - am i pulling the wrong thing yeah
39:26 - um i don't know i'm gonna do some kind
39:28 - of linux os
39:29 - probably um i don't know which linux
39:32 - operating system if you guys have
39:34 - recommendations for which one's good for
39:36 - a server
39:37 - do let me know but it will likely be
39:40 - linux
39:41 - although i could get windows server os
39:44 - and i can actually
39:45 - get a licensed copy of that fairly cheap
39:47 - because i worked at microsoft
39:49 - um okay so let's start getting some of
39:52 - this stuff done i need to have some
39:53 - water though first
39:56 - yeah they look trash hikery
40:03 - let's see if i missed anything in the
40:04 - chat here no that seems too important
40:07 - sam do you think calculus is hard ah
40:09 - yeah i think like i'd say objectively
40:11 - it's probably difficult
40:12 - i didn't have a ton of trouble with it
40:14 - but someone's saying mint a bunch of
40:15 - servers great send
40:17 - well none of you guys are being
40:18 - consistent i need to know which one to
40:20 - do
40:21 - they put that color because easy to know
40:22 - which is which ah that's true i guess if
40:24 - you have
40:24 - black what is that ground red what's
40:27 - that like the negative
40:28 - i don't know um what chair do you have
40:32 - a dr dxr racer i don't know the model
40:40 - just a reminder not to repeat your
40:41 - questions too often tim won't be able to
40:43 - see all of them true
40:45 - show us your hard drive um i think i
40:47 - already did but
40:49 - here's seagate barracuda hard drive
40:54 - how hard is computer science one to ten
40:55 - let's put it a 7.5
40:57 - what will be upcoming videos on sure
41:00 - that's a good question i believe i have
41:02 - a video
41:02 - on like balancing school and like uh you
41:05 - know time management a lot of you guys
41:06 - been asking me about that
41:08 - i have a video on
41:12 - what else do i have i have an ai for the
41:14 - checkers thing that'll actually be
41:15 - pretty interesting it's gonna be a mini
41:16 - max
41:17 - algorithm really applicable to game ai i
41:19 - have
41:20 - a video where i'm going to be doing a
41:22 - database project with mongodb
41:24 - i'm planning on doing a um what do you
41:27 - call it social media site i want to do
41:29 - another live stream i got a lot of stuff
41:30 - in the works but that's kind of like the
41:31 - basic
41:32 - i have a python speed course coming out
41:35 - all kinds of stuff
41:39 - add more things to ai do you play games
41:42 - yeah i do play video games right now i'm
41:44 - actually a full-time student so i'm not
41:45 - no longer working
41:46 - um i like playing i recently started
41:48 - playing warzone that's a pretty fun game
41:52 - you guys can see the pc behind me it has
41:54 - some pretty crazy hardware in it so i
41:56 - like to play games once in a while just
41:58 - to be like yes i can do this i can run
41:59 - you know 4k at
42:01 - 60fps so i can do 2k at 144.
42:07 - are you running dual pc system or one pc
42:09 - two monitors
42:11 - ah so this keyboard here good question
42:13 - really good question observant guy
42:15 - this keyboard is actually from my mac
42:18 - it seems like really overkill i have it
42:21 - here for the sole purpose of not having
42:23 - to reach here
42:24 - because i have this monitor here that
42:26 - actually runs
42:27 - uh what do you call it as a second
42:29 - monitor for this mac
42:30 - so i have like my recording software for
42:32 - my audio because it's all xlr input
42:35 - which is from this like i don't know if
42:36 - you guys can see that interface there
42:38 - so i have a monitor here that runs all
42:39 - my audio and then this keyboard
42:42 - and this mouse here are for this monitor
42:44 - so that i don't actually have to
42:46 - look at this mac screen i can close it
42:48 - if i want
42:49 - and it's just easier i don't have to
42:51 - reach over if i'm like working on this
42:52 - machine so i just
42:54 - tap over press the r button or whatever
42:55 - it may be um you should try rainbow six
42:59 - siege
43:00 - i've played cs go i've played a few
43:02 - other things gaming with tim
43:04 - yeah you're probably not gonna see that
43:05 - on this youtube channel maybe uh
43:07 - maybe a twitch i'll start streaming my
43:08 - pc can handle it i guess
43:10 - okay um it's time to do some more cable
43:13 - management can you guys see this at all
43:15 - let's see if i can like
43:16 - angle no that's gonna be really hard for
43:18 - me to work on if i angle it like this
43:23 - okay so fans i don't
43:26 - know why i don't need a fan splitter oh
43:29 - this is a fan cable
43:30 - ah you know what i can do i can install
43:34 - the front intake fans right now there's
43:35 - only one i'm going to install
43:37 - two more but they're not going to match
43:39 - this color scheme but
43:41 - that's fine okay
43:45 - so let's do that you guys can have a
43:47 - good nice look at these
43:49 - these cables while i try to take this
43:51 - front panel off all right
43:54 - so realistically how would this come off
43:56 - oh there you go just pops off
44:00 - okay let's take that out
44:04 - how often do you go fishing like a few
44:06 - times this summer
44:08 - um pretty into fishing though okay
44:11 - oh look at this i didn't even know this
44:14 - case did this can you guys
44:15 - see this swinging door here let's let's
44:18 - show it
44:19 - there's like a uh oops like a front like
44:22 - thing
44:23 - that's kind of cool i didn't know that i
44:24 - guess it's for the disc drives up top
44:27 - interesting okay pull this off
44:36 - they do not make these things easy oh
44:38 - jesus okay i always feel like i'm gonna
44:39 - break it when that happens
44:42 - all right now how will i install this
44:46 - fan
44:47 - and please tell me if it's a 120
44:49 - millimeter fan
44:51 - uh oh it does great okay so the fan in
44:54 - here is 140 millimeter
44:56 - um i actually might have an 140
44:58 - millimeter
45:00 - fan no i don't think i do i think i only
45:03 - have this one so these are both
45:04 - 140ml fans in here i didn't realize that
45:06 - so i guess we'll throw a 120 at the
45:08 - bottom
45:09 - okay and to install that i'm gonna have
45:11 - to take the hard drive phase out
45:14 - well i'm gonna be here longer than i
45:15 - expected um it's just going slow hope
45:19 - you guys aren't in any rush to see this
45:20 - finish but it will be on youtube
45:22 - afterwards again just we're doing this
45:23 - to kind of chat
45:24 - hang out
45:27 - what's your c gpa i feel like i'm just
45:30 - bragging when i say it but my current c
45:32 - gpa is 9.3 um
45:37 - decent power supply do you have decent
45:38 - power supply to hardware components
45:40 - yeah i have a 400 watt power supply i
45:43 - don't think i need anything more than
45:44 - that for what i'm doing
45:46 - gaming on time i would say maybe
45:48 - honestly time out with tim the name
45:49 - would permit me being able to game on it
45:52 - although tech with
45:52 - him i guess technically i could game on
45:55 - it
45:56 - but it's not really something that i'm
45:58 - gonna do just kind of far away from what
46:00 - the main channel is
46:01 - are you kidding me i'm gonna have to
46:02 - unscrew this from the bottom too
46:04 - they really don't make this easy to put
46:06 - these things in
46:07 - okay well and now time to take even more
46:10 - things out of this case
46:12 - okay let's flip this over without
46:15 - squashing the
46:16 - cables i think i can just do it like
46:18 - this that should be fine
46:21 - okay
46:27 - okay bye tim i'll be sure to watch the
46:29 - rest soon great see you later thanks for
46:31 - coming
46:34 - can you make a tutorial about algorithms
46:36 - that's really
46:37 - general it's a lot of algorithms
46:40 - yes go join the official tech with tim
46:42 - discord server if you guys want to
46:45 - be entered into competitions you want to
46:47 - win some money
46:48 - you want to chat with people sorry just
46:51 - came what are you doing well you can
46:53 - read the title i'm building a server
46:56 - and this is working pretty well i'm
46:57 - impressed i'm very impressed the camera
47:00 - i'm waiting for it to shut off
47:02 - when it shuts off everyone starts
47:03 - screaming at me in the live stream
47:04 - because i feel like that
47:06 - will potentially happen um but yeah okay
47:09 - other hard drive thing is out now
47:11 - time to put the fan in great so let's
47:14 - keep
47:14 - the logos the right way
47:19 - perfect okay now we need some screws for
47:22 - the fan
47:24 - ah that's the only thing i don't have
47:28 - okay one sec i gotta get some screws i
47:31 - just gotta walk around here
48:02 - all right i'm back
48:06 - um will you save this on the channel yep
48:09 - okay look at this thing like this is
48:10 - what i really appreciate when they give
48:12 - like these kind of things in the pc
48:14 - cases this is for my other pc case
48:16 - how much easier is it to get screws out
48:18 - of this little 20 cent plastic thing
48:20 - but yet they just don't do that i don't
48:22 - get why
48:24 - okay three and four
48:29 - [Music]
48:30 - don't need that anymore
48:35 - i am back this chair looks comfy it is
48:38 - very comfortable it also reclines
48:40 - all the way back and it has like the
48:42 - rocking mode in it so i can like do that
48:44 - um great chair i love this chair
48:50 - okay screw one
48:54 - and
48:58 - screw two
49:05 - oh no is this right
49:11 - no wrong hole
49:23 - ah there we go that's better
49:32 - the mic is behind him i actually have a
49:33 - mic right here that you guys
49:36 - it's like close enough that here if i do
49:38 - this should be able to see it
49:40 - yeah it's uh like a little boom mic
49:51 - okay that's what she said yeah great i
49:54 - figured you guys were gonna laugh about
49:56 - that
50:12 - okay there's oh my god i can't even read
50:15 - this chat i'm gonna get demonetized
50:22 - this is the issue i have i always just
50:24 - automatically start reading the chat
50:26 - just assuming that whatever i read is
50:27 - going to be fine and then i get like
50:29 - halfway through the sentence and it's
50:30 - something like
50:31 - what's popping up right now
50:37 - how big are the files you plan to store
50:39 - they're like a few gigabytes each
50:41 - like if i store like a like a video file
50:43 - that's like 10 minutes it's like two or
50:44 - three gigabytes for me
50:48 - audio files obviously don't use that
50:49 - much but it's just like good to have
50:50 - them all in one place
50:53 - and you know i can justify building this
50:54 - just business expense i put on my
50:56 - youtube channel you know
50:58 - so
51:02 - all right fan is almost installed then
51:05 - we can get the hard drives in
51:08 - and then we can start doing some cable
51:10 - management and we'll boot it up
51:16 - great okay
51:20 - close the front off here oh fan
51:23 - wire i gotta pull you through
51:28 - ah that's not gonna consider let's hope
51:30 - this fan wire is gonna be long enough to
51:31 - run
51:33 - the way that i put this fan in oh yeah
51:35 - we'll be good
51:42 - all right back up and go
51:46 - now to remember did i put
51:49 - the big rack in first i
51:52 - think so yes and it goes
51:57 - no this one goes in first
52:02 - opinions on rtx 3000 i think it's gonna
52:04 - be a lot more expensive than people
52:06 - think it is
52:07 - that's my opinion on it i think it's
52:10 - great value i think it's awesome
52:12 - i want one um even though i have a titan
52:15 - but uh uh like i wouldn't mind getting
52:18 - the 30 90 but that's like
52:19 - i think that's going to go in canada for
52:21 - like probably the same price as my titan
52:23 - and i
52:23 - just i don't need to spend that much
52:24 - money
52:28 - tim i will start coding youtube channel
52:30 - i will make a video with you hey maybe
52:32 - one day
52:35 - how can you afford college um yeah
52:38 - this i mean you can go watch i have a
52:39 - video talking about my earnings and all
52:41 - that stuff from youtube if you want to
52:43 - see how
52:44 - all that i can use usb port
52:48 - can you use 3g router i have no idea
52:51 - what that is
52:53 - how many computers phone laptops do you
52:55 - have in your house oh my god how many
52:56 - computers phones
52:57 - i can't even count i have two laptops
53:01 - i have the mac pro that i'm using i
53:03 - actually have a mac air upstairs
53:04 - i used to have a linux machine uh and
53:07 - then i sold it to one of my friends
53:08 - because i never used it
53:10 - but i don't really need laptops phone i
53:12 - have
53:13 - my iphone the you can tell what one it
53:16 - is just look at the cameras
53:17 - uh all that fun stuff let's see
53:24 - stay at tim live what are you guys all
53:27 - saying here
53:30 - you're a beast dude appreciate a shout
53:32 - out
53:34 - man i'm gonna butcher your name kush
53:36 - arga
53:37 - with a smiley face thing is that how you
53:40 - say it
53:40 - probably not why don't you use cloud
53:44 - storage instead i don't like cloud
53:46 - storage i just i also like building
53:47 - computers you know there is an aspect of
53:49 - like
53:49 - this is fun like i want to build this i
53:51 - want to have another pc
53:53 - you know and i can use this for
53:54 - something else in the future too right
53:56 - like
53:56 - it is just a one-time cost whereas the
53:59 - cloud server if i'm running that for a
54:00 - few years and i keep getting more and
54:01 - more stuff on it or
54:03 - you know something happens or it crashes
54:05 - or whatever obviously you know their
54:06 - servers are probably
54:07 - much much safer than mine would be but
54:10 - yeah hopefully you get the point with
54:11 - that okay it's a little
54:13 - wobbly making me a bit nervous but that
54:16 - should be fine
54:17 - okay i think i've installed this
54:19 - correctly
54:20 - let me start putting in the drives i
54:22 - guess i'm just going to start
54:24 - filling them at the bottom i don't see
54:25 - any reason to spread them out
54:27 - um so let's just start putting these
54:29 - guys in
54:31 - the mods are fighting mods come on
54:34 - you're supposed to be a role model here
54:36 - all right ah so that's what these things
54:38 - are so if you look at the back of this
54:41 - it's kind of weird the way that they
54:42 - have the holes set up like i thought it
54:43 - was going to be a larger
54:45 - bay uh like the full size ones but i
54:47 - actually have to put it on the bottom so
54:48 - i have all these rubber stops here so i
54:50 - guess that's what that's for
54:52 - let me move this over a bit you guys can
54:54 - actually see something
54:56 - kind of maybe all right there we go
54:59 - that's better
55:01 - okay so let's just start installing
55:04 - in these driveways something's on the
55:06 - foot of this
55:07 - there we go great okay
55:11 - move that over
55:14 - okay that goes there
55:21 - trying to figure out how to line these
55:23 - up
55:26 - having trouble i think it's more like
55:30 - about how far
55:33 - out it would have to be at least that i
55:34 - guess okay there we go
55:40 - can you make a series on cue learning i
55:41 - might do that actually i was thinking
55:43 - about making something on cue learning
55:44 - no promises but i might looks like
55:46 - mickey mouse stream would be great
55:48 - would you guys watch me game really you
55:50 - would find that interesting
55:52 - i'm not that good at video games
55:55 - okay so let's put these dang rubber
55:59 - things in it's gonna be
56:00 - annoying okay there's one
56:08 - there's two if you want to see what i'm
56:10 - doing i'm adding like the rubber stops
56:12 - in here i think the camera's focused on
56:13 - that yeah i think you can see that
56:15 - um in this uh thing here i don't really
56:18 - know
56:18 - where they go to be honest but
56:21 - let's see that looks about
56:24 - right maybe
56:28 - maybe that's better how far back are
56:31 - they gonna stick is the question
56:33 - let's see
56:40 - okay perfect great so i can put them
56:44 - not where i have them okay let's move
56:47 - over there
56:50 - minecraft is easy everyone is good no i
56:52 - know my i know like i'm not talking
56:54 - about minecraft i'm just talking about
56:55 - gaming in general
56:56 - what uh time is in your country right
56:58 - now it's 5 30. oh we've been going for
57:00 - almost an
57:01 - hour yeah this is gonna be longer than i
57:02 - than i thought i'm just talking too much
57:05 - uh let's put it in the wrong one again
57:09 - see almost made the mistake and said
57:10 - that joke that you guys kept talking
57:12 - about but
57:13 - uh the cam loves to focus on the case is
57:15 - it still
57:17 - focus on me come on working
57:21 - move it over yeah i have auto focus on
57:25 - obviously um
57:26 - i mean i can't really control the focus
57:27 - manually where i am right now
57:29 - so hopefully it works but it doesn't not
57:32 - much i can do
57:34 - all right so i think these screws ah
57:37 - that's why those go in at the bottom
57:39 - okay
57:41 - i think these are the ones for today
57:45 - there we go your hands are shaking like
57:49 - crazy
57:50 - that's just because i'm using a
57:51 - screwdriver but there you go screws
57:54 - show you guys everything you need to
57:55 - install these ones
58:01 - is this your third pc this is my second
58:03 - pc um that i
58:04 - have here i've built a bunch of other
58:06 - ones but then i've sold them
58:08 - as i move on to another one two new ones
58:11 - but this will be
58:12 - yeah two active pcs typescript react
58:16 - tutorial maybe maybe
58:20 - someone is uh spamming a message deleted
58:24 - let's just remove this guy from the chat
58:25 - you guys are too nice mods can i do oh i
58:27 - can't do that from here
58:29 - maybe i can do it here let's see
58:32 - oh it doesn't even show it on my thing
58:37 - yeah chat isn't working on this computer
58:39 - okay that's fine
58:45 - all right hard drive one installed in
58:48 - the cage
58:50 - let's do the rest
58:53 - now i know where these go
58:59 - why do you have holes for headset cables
59:03 - in your server
59:04 - oh i it just came with them assembly
59:07 - language tutorial
59:08 - no i'm not gonna do that um there are a
59:11 - lot of reasons to have your own system
59:13 - but costs for owned equipment
59:14 - are more than just one off purchase
59:16 - charge and the risk of data loss
59:18 - should always be considered it's always
59:19 - fun building a pc yeah exactly
59:22 - i think that's where that one was yep
59:25 - great
59:30 - all right number two
59:33 - where are the screws right there
59:41 - do servers lower your internet speed not
59:44 - if they're not connected to the internet
59:46 - or if they're not i guess using any
59:48 - internet bandwidth which this one
59:50 - probably won't be
59:53 - do a collab with kale halden and tekley
59:56 - sure go comment on their channel ask
59:57 - them if they want to do one
60:04 - are you going to be doing another
60:05 - internship yes i will likely well
60:07 - i've signed already that i'm going to be
60:09 - doing another one at microsoft so
60:10 - hopefully in person this time we'll see
60:13 - obviously that's going to be dependent
60:15 - on all the stuff happening right now but
60:18 - it looks like fingers crossed i will be
60:20 - there in person
60:24 - now i will note that if i go there in
60:25 - person i will not be bringing
60:27 - all this pc stuff with me that's gonna
60:29 - be way too much to set up
60:30 - so there probably will be like less
60:32 - videos when i go but there's only 12
60:34 - weeks so
60:35 - how much did this setup cost if you're
60:37 - talking about the entire setup
60:39 - ask but this specific computer is just
60:41 - about 900
60:43 - canadian so really it's not that bad if
60:45 - you think about it and this is more
60:46 - expensive than
60:47 - i need to spend uh on this i just
60:50 - figured let's get it so it's sustainable
60:52 - for the future and i don't have to buy
60:53 - any more parts again
60:57 - um do you play the lottery no
61:00 - why choose you ottawa over you waterloo
61:02 - i'd like to have a life when i'm in
61:04 - school and i really
61:05 - don't need a u waterloo degree if that
61:07 - makes any sense
61:09 - um are you a senior i'm 20 years old
61:12 - i thought that was kind of common
61:14 - knowledge maybe not
61:16 - all right how long have we been going
61:17 - for on this stream does it say
61:20 - no i think i just have to look at the
61:21 - time to figure it out yeah so about an
61:23 - hour
61:28 - okay and drive three
61:31 - is done all right let's put these guys
61:34 - in
61:34 - [Music]
61:37 - this guy will here up there
61:40 - okay i think that's in
61:44 - i'll show you guys this in a second let
61:45 - me just get it all set up
61:49 - and there we go all right so now
61:53 - three hard drives i think you can see
61:54 - them there kind of
61:56 - yeah you get the point i do need to
61:58 - actually flip this
61:59 - upside down though uh it makes me a
62:02 - little nervous while i screw these
62:04 - things in
62:05 - okay let's put that down carefully
62:09 - good
62:14 - so there's some screws here for the hard
62:15 - drive base that i just need to put in
62:17 - um tim have you made your own neural
62:20 - network
62:21 - uh yes i've done that in a bunch of
62:24 - videos
62:25 - but not like coded from scratch if
62:27 - that's what you're asking no i haven't
62:28 - done that
62:28 - ah i just also saw there's room for an
62:31 - intake fan
62:32 - at the bottom which i'm actually going
62:33 - to install as well
62:35 - because i have another fan so that will
62:37 - actually be good to do get a little more
62:39 - airflow in here because there's only
62:40 - going to be
62:40 - two intake fans and there's going to be
62:42 - that crappy cpu cooler that you guys saw
62:46 - this case is not ideal for pc
62:48 - temperature since it if you notice it is
62:50 - blocked from top heat rises so i'm going
62:52 - to heat intake from the left and blowing
62:54 - it out with the outtake from the right
62:56 - yeah there is an outtake fan i'm gonna
62:58 - have another intake fan
62:59 - uh and i can install fan at the top if i
63:02 - want
63:03 - which i might do because i actually have
63:04 - more fans i have to find them now
63:06 - because they're hiding
63:08 - from me somewhere okay so that's it
63:12 - let's put that other fan in while i have
63:14 - access to this side where'd i put it
63:16 - here it is
63:17 - another fan that's gonna go that way up
63:20 - i guess
63:21 - okay
63:26 - let's see if i can use the monitor to
63:28 - put this in
63:32 - nope that's not gonna be any good okay
63:35 - these guys go like that until this fits
63:40 - perfect that can run in here
63:46 - and yeah now this is going to be
63:48 - annoying i guess we'll have to do it
63:50 - this way
63:58 - trying not to squish all my cables
64:02 - all right that's fine i'll be that'll be
64:03 - all right
64:06 - and i need more fan screws good job i
64:08 - didn't put that away
64:09 - all right where are you from i am from
64:12 - israel i
64:13 - am from toronto area
64:16 - generally speaking
64:34 - tim how come you don't use c sharp i
64:36 - just don't even need to use c sharp i
64:38 - used it when i was like really young
64:39 - when i was learning how to program
64:41 - but now i just don't need to use it if i
64:43 - needed to use it i would but
64:46 - just don't really have any desire to or
64:48 - need to uh why does it matter to you if
64:50 - he's paying for school himself
64:52 - asking someone how they spend their
64:53 - money is rude uh it's fine
64:55 - i could see how it might come across
64:56 - that way but i don't mind
64:58 - um do you plan to get a nine to five
65:02 - job when you graduate um i'm gonna
65:06 - refrain from answering that question i
65:07 - don't really know
65:08 - is the answer to that to be honest um i
65:10 - have
65:11 - you know a choice to do what i want to
65:13 - do there but we'll see
65:15 - um get marquis brown on your show you
65:18 - think he would come on my show with only
65:20 - 400k
65:21 - subs maybe i could convince him because
65:23 - i'm young enough we'll see but i'd love
65:24 - to have him on he
65:25 - seems like a great guy i watch a fair
65:27 - amount of his videos um
65:29 - i just want to thank you for making
65:30 - clean videos that are actually helpful
65:33 - other people don't explain well enough
65:35 - or use bad language thank you so much no
65:37 - problem thank you for
65:38 - giving me the thank you
65:48 - okay now i can put the dust filter back
65:51 - in
65:55 - don't hit the hdmi that could end end
65:58 - the stream
65:59 - please don't do that okay and there we
66:02 - go awesome
66:04 - so now i don't think there's anything
66:07 - else to do
66:08 - other than start managing some cables
66:12 - and yeah and then running all the uh
66:14 - yeah running all the other stuff
66:16 - okay grab a quick sip of water here
66:21 - let's see what everyone's saying
66:24 - slow mode yeah that's a good idea how do
66:26 - i put slow mode on
66:32 - don't know how to do that
66:35 - no we got the mods you guys can deal
66:38 - with it
66:44 - um
66:46 - how much do you study slash work in a
66:48 - week um
66:50 - a lot i don't know maybe like 70 hours
66:53 - 80 hours
66:54 - like obviously both combined
66:58 - how many is that a day actually that's a
66:59 - lot that's probably a lie i probably do
67:01 - yeah but
67:02 - maybe 10 to 12 a day
67:06 - but some like those are like you know
67:07 - i'm taking breaks in between i'm not
67:09 - just like going
67:10 - as hard as possible all day um that
67:14 - would be
67:14 - unsustainable but i don't feel burnt out
67:16 - or anything i feel pretty healthy
67:18 - i always want to make sure i'm you know
67:20 - not well rested i'm not tired
67:22 - um i really can't get a good angle to do
67:24 - this for you guys hopefully you're fine
67:25 - just the way it is i don't think many of
67:28 - you really care to watch all the pc
67:30 - stuff i think it's more about just
67:31 - chatting
67:32 - okay you know what maybe it'll be easier
67:34 - to see like that
67:36 - okay
67:40 - and we got some fan hubs here actually i
67:43 - should probably start
67:44 - running these fans yeah that'd be a good
67:46 - idea
67:48 - okay you can go below
67:51 - into that
67:58 - dude make a server using a 3g router i
68:01 - don't
68:01 - don't know what you're talking about i
68:03 - have tutorials on raspberry pi
68:07 - um one os
68:11 - linux i don't know exactly what
68:12 - distribution so i can't
68:14 - give you more answers there but it will
68:17 - be linux
68:19 - okay so that can go through there
68:24 - yeah this is a great case this is highly
68:26 - recommend i should
68:28 - tell you guys the model let me actually
68:29 - grab that i'm sorry
68:43 - all right this is a fractal design
68:46 - define
68:47 - or divine sorry r5 two bucks congrats on
68:50 - finishing the pc thanks bin
68:52 - binique banik i don't know how you say
68:55 - that um but
68:56 - uh it's not done yet but i appreciate it
68:58 - anyways still gotta run all these wires
69:00 - gotta turn it on
69:02 - but it will be done pretty soon
69:06 - okay so that would be the cpu
69:09 - come on get in there
69:16 - really how difficult they gonna make
69:18 - this to do it's my motherboard blocking
69:21 - something
69:21 - no should be able just let's try to do
69:24 - one
69:25 - four pin at a time there we go
69:31 - said express your feelings on all the
69:34 - programming languages you know
69:35 - what's your iq i don't know i'm maybe
69:38 - we'll do that later
69:39 - i want to finish a little bit of stuff
69:41 - here before i
69:42 - focus too heavily on the chat but look
69:44 - we have enough where i can actually use
69:46 - a graphics card i don't think you guys
69:47 - can see this but i have an 8 pin and a 6
69:49 - pin
69:49 - so that's actually good to know i'm
69:51 - going to tuck that back here
69:53 - cable tie let's let's run that so this
69:55 - could actually be like a low end gaming
69:57 - machine at some point
70:00 - and honestly pretty affordable just
70:02 - throw a gpu in this
70:04 - obviously don't buy all the drives which
70:05 - cost a good amount of money it's like
70:08 - 75 bucks to drive canadian and yeah
70:11 - you'd be good to go
70:14 - fortunately i don't have side cutters i
70:16 - got to use scissors kind of sucks but
70:19 - it's fine you can make do with it
70:22 - i'm interesting you guys know would you
70:24 - um would you recommend having like an
70:26 - ssd boot drive because i could probably
70:29 - do
70:30 - that because i have a bunch of ssds in
70:31 - my other system and i could rip one out
70:33 - because i'm i won't need it as much
70:35 - anymore because i'm going to have this
70:36 - this file storage
70:37 - um let me know if you would think that
70:39 - would be a good idea to have an ssd boot
70:41 - driver if it wouldn't really make like a
70:42 - huge difference especially if i'm not
70:44 - going to be
70:44 - actively using the machine it's just
70:47 - going to be kind of idly sitting there
70:50 - be interesting to know um
70:53 - do you think it's good or would you
70:55 - prefer being in silicon valley or
70:56 - seattle rather than being in toronto
70:59 - honestly right now i would prefer to
71:01 - live in canada
71:02 - just based on you know all the stuff
71:04 - that you guys are dealing with over
71:05 - there in the states
71:06 - but that doesn't mean that i wouldn't
71:08 - want to live there at some point
71:11 - because i do like seattle from when i've
71:13 - been there i think
71:14 - silicon valley is cool like it'd be neat
71:16 - to live there
71:17 - but canada is kind of nice uh no
71:20 - complaints with toronto and i don't
71:21 - really live like right in the city i'm
71:23 - not a big city guy anyways like but i
71:25 - can do it but i just
71:26 - it's not you know i don't really care to
71:28 - live in the city
71:30 - so i'm not uh you know fussed about that
71:33 - okay
71:36 - cables sata
71:41 - run over there no
71:49 - i will show you guys what i'm doing in a
71:51 - minute just want to get a little bit
71:52 - done
71:53 - because i need to focus here
71:59 - but if it's just let's see it'll help
72:02 - with boot times while the pc is running
72:04 - it probably make that much of a
72:05 - difference for your goal
72:06 - if it's just lying in the dust yeah
72:07 - that's what i figured um can you make a
72:09 - tutorial on raspberry pi i've made one
72:11 - is he building a tech with tim minecraft
72:13 - server okay if i get
72:15 - let's i don't know how how can i even do
72:17 - this if a hundred people in the chat
72:20 - say they want a tech with tim minecraft
72:22 - server
72:23 - i will boot one up maybe not like today
72:26 - but i will i will boot one up at some
72:27 - point i've actually really wanted to
72:29 - have attack with some minecraft server i
72:30 - think that would be kind of cool
72:31 - um but let me know because if you want
72:34 - one i would be
72:35 - i'd be down to make one i probably won't
72:37 - host it on
72:38 - like on my network but i will uh you
72:41 - know i'll pay for hosting for you guys
72:42 - if you want that
72:43 - and i would hop on there like every now
72:45 - and then and play around
72:48 - but i need a lot of people to tell me
72:50 - they want one because i'm not going to
72:52 - make it for just like you know a really
72:53 - small amount of people
73:00 - yes yes no please yes yes yes
73:06 - uh watch tomorrow that's gonna be what
73:08 - i'm doing making a minecraft server
73:11 - keep just just uh like you know get the
73:14 - if you guys want one let me know
73:15 - what type of server would you want it to
73:17 - be is the big question like i'm a fan of
73:18 - factions i really like
73:20 - factions but i don't know what you guys
73:21 - would want on the tech with
73:23 - like you want a creative server you want
73:24 - a redstone server what makes sense what
73:27 - do you think let me know
73:28 - is there no sata on this ah dang it's
73:30 - only molex
73:32 - okay i don't even want that then so i
73:33 - only
73:36 - so also if anyone knows how do you go um
73:39 - molex to sata is that is that possible
73:42 - let me know
73:43 - because that's gonna be important to
73:45 - know
73:47 - this is going to have to run somewhere
73:49 - else
73:54 - so yeah question what to minecraft
73:56 - server and
73:58 - molex to seda is that a thing i'm going
74:00 - to assume that's probably a thing but
74:03 - let me know if more likes to say it is a
74:04 - thing and what type of minecraft server
74:05 - you would want
74:07 - redstone world you could program vanilla
74:11 - i can i couldn't do vanilla um skyblock
74:14 - skyblock factions
74:16 - skyblock hunger games
74:20 - ah ripper four dollars from ripper
74:22 - appreciate it buddy thank you
74:24 - ripper go uh go plug your plug your
74:26 - twitch david
74:28 - i uh that's that's my friend giving a uh
74:30 - a donation there
74:32 - go go follow him on twitch he's a rocket
74:34 - league streamer
74:35 - okay let's get this connected now
74:43 - i really hate these cables these yellow
74:46 - and red and oh
74:48 - so bad okay another sata
74:52 - another sata
74:59 - if you're living in toronto i mean when
75:01 - you're on campus class resume you're
75:02 - gonna stop making videos no i've made
75:04 - videos
75:04 - when i was when i was on campus classes
75:07 - uh and i also i'm gonna try to just do
75:08 - it online it's a lot easier for me to do
75:10 - stuff online
75:12 - okay making good progress you've almost
75:16 - wired up
75:17 - just need to wire up the sata cables and
75:19 - some of these fan
75:21 - cables um and then we're gonna be pretty
75:24 - much
75:26 - pretty much good to go i might need to
75:28 - look for another
75:29 - fan splitter there should be enough
75:32 - headers but it's just a question of
75:34 - can i fit the header like can i uh can i
75:37 - get to it oh no there's another one here
75:39 - yes
75:39 - let's go so this splitter i thought it
75:41 - was just two it's actually three
75:43 - i'll give you guys an update in one sec
75:44 - once this last thing is managed
75:48 - and you guys can give me your thoughts
75:51 - okay
75:52 - so let's run that there
75:55 - okay
76:02 - so obviously still got stuff to do i
76:05 - have to take this one and run it
76:07 - over there more these yellows really
76:09 - suck
76:10 - and i have to uh just take this cable
76:13 - and like tie it up
76:14 - but generally i think that's pretty good
76:16 - um
76:17 - let's see thanks for the good content
76:19 - channel no problem i just started my
76:21 - homework
76:22 - wait so why the redding ketchup i didn't
76:24 - know this came with these cables and to
76:25 - be honest you know i'm going to see it
76:26 - on the front
76:27 - it's just going to be on the back so
76:29 - it's not really a big deal at all
76:31 - but obviously i didn't want the ketchup
76:33 - mustard cables that was not
76:36 - in the plan okay time to start
76:38 - connecting some things to this
76:40 - motherboard
76:40 - front panel connectors are gonna have to
76:42 - go in maybe i'll lay it vertically for
76:44 - you guys after i get this
76:45 - big one in
76:49 - come on these things are not easy to
76:53 - get in
77:00 - okay
77:04 - you know what let's just finish this i
77:06 - gotta do these anyways
77:11 - what's the gpu no gpu it's just a server
77:13 - i don't need gpu
77:14 - it has a um built-in graphics unit on
77:18 - the processor which is why i got this
77:19 - one
77:20 - why is this video of eight dislikes yeah
77:22 - if you guys are here right now and
77:23 - you're still watching
77:24 - go like the video come on help me out
77:27 - there should be at least 300 likes on
77:29 - this
77:29 - how many like 404 come on we have some
77:31 - more likes than that
77:44 - okay let's start tying some of this
77:47 - stuff up
78:15 - give you like yes thank you 443
78:18 - 442 on my end maybe it's desync okay
78:22 - good come on guys keep liking it if
78:23 - you're here
78:25 - i want to know is the salary higher in
78:27 - the u.s or canada salary is
78:29 - much higher in the u.s like
78:30 - significantly higher
78:32 - almost close to double as much um
78:36 - which is kind of crazy if you think
78:37 - about it but that's that's what it is
78:39 - canadian dollar
78:40 - just sucks it also i guess honestly
78:42 - though it's pretty expensive to live in
78:43 - toronto compared
78:45 - like in the states yeah it's really
78:46 - expensive too but if you guys heard how
78:48 - much it was to live
78:49 - in some places in toronto um i think
78:51 - you'd probably
78:52 - be surprised if you don't already know
78:54 - of course the
78:55 - how expensive it really is
78:58 - and so i think it's one of the more
79:00 - expensive cities or it probably is the
79:02 - most expensive city in canada maybe
79:04 - vancouver
79:05 - is close
79:10 - let's see what's everyone else saying
79:13 - here
79:15 - maybe we can get 1k likes
79:20 - well not with the amount of people we
79:21 - have in here right now but at some point
79:22 - sure
79:23 - hello do you have any idea how much
79:24 - hosting a discord bought with a hundred
79:26 - servers what 10k users would cost i did
79:29 - i have no idea
79:30 - i have no idea sorry
79:34 - if it's not something that i've done yes
79:37 - i just
79:38 - probably can't tell you okay well cables
79:40 - are looking
79:41 - pretty good to be honest i want to wrap
79:44 - this last one in here
79:48 - now we just need sata cables and then
79:50 - the wiring will almost be done
79:52 - okay so where is my sata ports
79:56 - here at the back
80:00 - okay let's run you there
80:04 - we'll run up actually yeah
80:12 - can you pronounce my name reshab
80:16 - maybe he seems pretty stressed i'm not
80:19 - stressed it just it is
80:20 - difficult to uh talk the entire time and
80:24 - not bore you guys while building a
80:25 - computer
80:29 - are you gonna do a typescript tutorial
80:31 - maybe
80:36 - who tim's building a server yep
80:41 - have you tried using super sata live i
80:43 - don't know what that is
80:53 - what are you building this for just a
80:55 - file server just to just to store files
80:58 - i have a lot of youtube videos i need to
81:00 - store
81:03 - okay
81:09 - see the cables are good let's
81:12 - run those up here
81:32 - there's one two
81:37 - and three
81:44 - trying to find some interesting
81:46 - questions to answer here important
81:48 - question well you put as important so i
81:49 - must read it
81:50 - is flutter dart a replacement for
81:53 - javascript
81:54 - no just not flutter and dart
81:57 - are pretty specific to
82:00 - what they do which is the dart is really
82:03 - only used in flutter from what i know
82:08 - okay now we gotta start wiring this
82:21 - okay these things are not connecting
82:29 - okay i need a light this is too hard to
82:31 - do
82:34 - why build a pc and not use a nas unit
82:36 - because i couldn't live stream myself
82:39 - building a naz unit because that
82:41 - wouldn't be very much fun
82:44 - so i figured i'd build a pc part of this
82:46 - is also just like i wanted to do a live
82:48 - stream so i was like what can i do
82:50 - that i need to do which is build this
82:52 - file server that i can live stream that
82:53 - would be somewhat interesting
82:55 - and related to technology and here we go
82:58 - i actually don't think these cables are
83:00 - going to look that bad
83:02 - maybe i'm wrong when they're just on the
83:04 - front side
83:06 - if i can get this what is this 24 pin if
83:09 - i can get this
83:09 - in it's not being easy
83:13 - okay
83:18 - ah well it would help if i put it the
83:20 - correct way uh yeah oh there you go
83:23 - that's better
83:28 - okay so we still got all front i o
83:32 - and sata and then we're done
83:45 - okay one sata
84:01 - great okay let's see
84:05 - lots of discord messages what are you
84:06 - guys saying here
84:09 - someone is messaging me while watching
84:11 - the stream on
84:12 - uh on discord
84:16 - 280 you guys have dropped off only the
84:19 - real fans are here no no i'm just
84:20 - kidding
84:21 - um let's see what people are saying
84:25 - so the chat is frozen on my other thing
84:26 - for some reason nice i'll watch it later
84:31 - can you code in mips no
84:37 - [Music]
84:41 - nothing interesting to respond to in the
84:42 - chat if you guys have any specific
84:44 - questions
84:45 - feel free to ask them but they have to
84:46 - be like something that i'll actually
84:48 - want to answer you know
84:50 - you guys ask some interesting questions
84:53 - okay good can you guys see that
84:57 - it looks pretty i mean it's hard just
84:58 - because all these yellow but it actually
85:00 - is
85:01 - very managed right now although it
85:03 - doesn't even matter because i'm not
85:04 - going to see any of this
85:06 - but what did i need to do i need to pull
85:08 - these sata cables that's what i need to
85:10 - do
85:12 - okay awesome
85:15 - [Music]
85:20 - sweet all right front eye
85:24 - let's see can you guys see that how's
85:25 - that look not too bad eh
85:28 - can't even really see many cables at all
85:37 - let's go down and
85:40 - let's fix these data cables
85:52 - oh that would be the microphone let's
85:54 - fix that
85:55 - can you guys see that in the shot no no
85:57 - we're good okay
86:09 - what would you do besides programming
86:11 - that's a good question
86:13 - i would uh i'm interested in like space
86:15 - you know like aerospace technology like
86:17 - rockets like
86:19 - that would be interesting to me i would
86:21 - uh
86:22 - not be like an astronaut but maybe like
86:24 - design rockets or something like i feel
86:25 - like that would be cool
86:27 - like you know i don't want to be like
86:28 - the cliche like rocket scientist but
86:30 - that would be interesting i would
86:31 - definitely like consider something like
86:33 - that
86:35 - um that's only that's honestly the only
86:36 - other thing i could really think
86:38 - i would want to do other than
86:40 - programming uh would be like something
86:42 - with like space
86:44 - okay there we go now those c cables are
86:46 - around nicely
86:48 - all right front io
86:51 - can i contact you personally you can try
86:54 - but
86:55 - i get contacted personally many times a
86:57 - day
86:59 - is there any interesting way to
87:00 - incorporate database into machine
87:01 - learning and ai
87:02 - well an interesting thing is what google
87:04 - and all these huge cloud server
87:06 - companies do
87:07 - they use ai to actually cool their
87:09 - databases so
87:10 - it's interesting but like they'll change
87:12 - how fast the
87:13 - like what the ac level is at based on
87:16 - like determining what the peak load is
87:17 - going to be at a certain time
87:19 - and they actually can save like 20 or 30
87:20 - percent of their cost by using an ai to
87:23 - like
87:24 - regulate the temperatures of their data
87:25 - center which is kind of interesting
87:29 - let's see i love space technologies as
87:33 - well yeah it'd be cool
87:35 - um you could work at spacex yeah exactly
87:37 - some even like as a programmer like that
87:39 - would be so cool like working at spacex
87:40 - would be
87:41 - in like i mean i i've i heard they work
87:43 - pretty hard like i don't know if i'd be
87:45 - able to do this youtube channel if i
87:46 - work there but that would be interesting
87:50 - let's see what everyone's saying
87:57 - we ever do python packages
88:02 - your phone's light is on aha thank you
88:06 - guys
88:06 - battery was going to be gone under that
88:08 - pretty quickly
88:15 - do you have a car kind of i'm living at
88:18 - my parents house currently so we have
88:19 - three cars between four people so if i
88:22 - ever need to drive something i do but
88:23 - it's not like i don't own the car like i
88:25 - didn't i haven't bought the car
88:27 - if that's what you're asking okay
88:30 - usb 3.0 you are aware on this
88:34 - motherboard i'm gonna have to rerun that
88:36 - cable
88:38 - okay those are all the hd audio
88:42 - uh another fan cable i had to run forgot
88:44 - about this
88:46 - okay at least i haven't really zip tied
88:48 - anything yet so that's good
88:50 - all right we're getting to the home
88:51 - stretch here guys what are your thoughts
88:54 - on code wars
88:55 - i've kind of heard about it but i don't
88:57 - like i've never used it before so i
88:58 - don't really have any
89:00 - opinions on it i'm just trying to find
89:03 - a fan header on this board
89:07 - let's see oh this board has two m.2
89:09 - slots hello i didn't even know that
89:13 - let's see tell me you have another fan
89:15 - header come on
89:16 - where would a fan header be
89:20 - oh there you go two fan hundreds at the
89:21 - bottom i've gotta run
89:24 - some fan thing there
89:28 - all right
89:39 - okay fan cable ah
89:43 - that's gonna be a problem let's get that
89:47 - under yeah that's not gonna work like
89:51 - that okay i guess it's we're gonna have
89:52 - to run down
89:53 - just have to hide it
89:58 - i could remount the fan no that's fine
90:02 - just we can have one loose cable
90:06 - that's really annoying though that i
90:07 - have to that has to be visible
90:12 - so i'm having this problem right now i
90:13 - have this fan but the cable for it is
90:15 - just so short
90:16 - and they mounted in a way where it
90:17 - doesn't give me enough length to run it
90:19 - where i want it to so i might
90:20 - remount it to be able to actually
90:23 - manage it properly and now it's stuck in
90:26 - this
90:27 - thing here i can't even get it out
90:31 - there we go okay see
90:34 - where's another fan header oh there's
90:36 - one right
90:37 - there okay does anyone know if there's
90:40 - any problem with
90:41 - with plugging this into an aio pump fan
90:46 - i have like a um if correct elso fan
90:50 - pins on the top side of motherboard
90:53 - there's there isn't actually any on this
90:56 - um there's some fan pins but they all
90:58 - say like cpu
90:59 - pump and all this stuff
91:02 - someone if you could put in the chat
91:06 - is it okay to plug a regular fan into
91:08 - like a pump fan header
91:10 - um wait that's weird those are five
91:13 - pin cool geez
91:17 - okay let's look for this there's another
91:19 - one there
91:21 - cpu fan i suppose i could put the
91:24 - exhaust fan
91:25 - on a cpu fan header
91:30 - and then there's two at the bottom
91:34 - okay let's try to figure this out let's
91:35 - see what you guys are saying
91:40 - no no it's not good to do that okay
91:44 - unless you're responding to the the
91:45 - discord plug
91:47 - okay anyways i need to remount this fan
91:49 - but if someone could tell me that that
91:50 - would be great
91:55 - i did it for one of my fans okay well if
91:57 - your computer's still functioning then
91:58 - i'm gonna
92:00 - say that's okay
92:12 - look at this no issues with the stream
92:14 - yet everything still looks good sounds
92:15 - good
92:18 - surprised to give you guys some uh for
92:22 - any of you interested in how this is
92:24 - actually working i have this camera
92:25 - obviously
92:26 - and it's hooked up to a monitor with an
92:28 - hdmi port so i have a mod like i'm
92:29 - looking at the monitor right now if you
92:31 - see me
92:32 - continually looking there and then the
92:33 - monitor has an hdmi pass-through
92:35 - and that passer actually runs like all
92:37 - the way around the back of my desk
92:39 - to my computer that has a capture card
92:41 - in it and then we're connected to obs
92:43 - and obs is streaming just bought the
92:46 - merch today that's what i like to hear
92:49 - well let me know when it comes in you
92:52 - tag me on instagram or something when it
92:54 - comes in and i'll uh
92:55 - put you on my story okay
92:58 - let's run this through here
93:04 - instead of discord nitro
93:12 - [Music]
93:15 - all right i think that will be long
93:19 - enough
93:20 - let's see let's get there oh that's such
93:23 - a reach
93:24 - i know you guys can't see right now but
93:25 - i'm just trying to
93:28 - find how i can wire this exhaust fan out
93:32 - hmm i might have to use these
93:36 - where is that even going to
93:40 - fan controller or something maybe
93:42 - there's a fan controller in here
93:43 - somewhere
93:44 - ah i think there is i don't even know
93:48 - these these fans are annoying
93:49 - let's see maybe there's a better way to
93:51 - do this
93:56 - i'm pretty sure i have a fan splitter
93:58 - okay
93:59 - i'm actually well i'm still here but i'm
94:02 - gonna be searching for a fan splitter
94:03 - for a minute i have like a big box of
94:04 - stuff under my desk
94:16 - all right let's move that
94:20 - yeah so for anyone not aware current
94:23 - problem i have
94:24 - is i have a fan wire it's just not long
94:26 - enough to hit
94:27 - the pin without being wired like
94:30 - hidden right without being hidden
94:32 - essentially so i'm just trying to see if
94:34 - i have like some kind of extension for
94:35 - that
94:36 - because i remember i used to have one um
94:39 - but i just don't know
94:41 - where it is
94:46 - and who can guess how old this hard
94:48 - drive is oh my god i think this is like
94:50 - 10 plus years old uh
94:55 - come on the fan splitter being here
94:58 - somewhere
95:06 - oh pci riser that's great
95:09 - so much stuff in this box i'm a router
95:13 - that's great i don't even know if you
95:14 - guys can see that but i have a router
95:28 - ah would you look at this i have a
95:31 - intel core i5 it actually doesn't have
95:34 - that in it it has an intel celeron
95:36 - inside of it maybe i could have used
95:37 - this processor i didn't even remember i
95:39 - have that
95:40 - great so many people left 261 you guys
95:43 - are troopers just watching me search
95:44 - through stuff
95:45 - i have what is this a
95:51 - little little network card i don't even
95:54 - need that for this this has ethernet on
95:55 - it already
95:57 - okay come on have one of these things
96:22 - all right so i have another 140
96:25 - millimeter fan actually is that bigger
96:26 - no it's not it's just 140.
96:28 - is this cable longer no it's not
96:32 - let's see what other fans do i have in
96:34 - here okay
96:36 - i have more of these fans jeez
96:39 - tell me that the extension is in here
96:42 - it's not
96:56 - i'm just pulling out random stuff look
96:58 - at iphone who knows what iphone this is
97:00 - i don't even remember what one this is
97:02 - maybe i could sell that who knows
97:04 - um what is everyone saying in here
97:08 - is that even gigabit i have no idea this
97:10 - is just all old tech stuff i have and i
97:12 - thought i had a
97:13 - extension in here but i might just have
97:14 - to bite the bullet and and not use it
97:17 - um no sorry use the fan but
97:20 - wire it the annoying way
97:23 - we'll see though i'm going to keep
97:24 - looking this would be a big deal if i
97:26 - find this
97:39 - okay i'm giving up on the search the
97:41 - processor can go away
97:43 - this can go away i'm not going to leave
97:44 - this iphone um
97:46 - maybe someone wants that and what else
97:49 - do i have in here i think that's
97:51 - it okay did i pull any other stuff no
97:54 - it says
98:19 - all right looks like we're gonna wire it
98:21 - the annoying way
98:31 - i'm gonna make pasta after 10 minutes i
98:32 - forgot to uh buy pasta
98:34 - yeah uh i mean i didn't realize that
98:37 - this was gonna happen i just thought it
98:38 - would be long enough
98:39 - oh i found a way to do it we're good
98:45 - i probably should just looked a little
98:46 - harder before i
98:49 - spent that time looking for that thing
98:51 - but i think i found a way
98:52 - it'll just barely reach if i'm correct
98:58 - what are we looking at here so we're
98:59 - almost at an hour or we're a little past
99:02 - an hour and a half
99:03 - i'll try to wrap this up at like the two
99:05 - hour mark but
99:06 - i mean i'm in no rush okay
99:13 - whatcha gonna stream next i have no idea
99:16 - what do you guys want to see me stream
99:17 - doing uh computer science homework
99:20 - i don't have that many other things to
99:22 - stream unless i do like a live coding
99:24 - thing
99:24 - or if you guys want to watch gaming i
99:27 - suppose i could stream when i game but
99:28 - like
99:29 - i don't do that very often
99:37 - join the official twt discord server
99:41 - have i looked at the submission to the
99:42 - code jam i've not looked at them yet
99:44 - because i'm gonna look at them as like a
99:46 - first glance in a youtube video i do i'm
99:48 - actually probably gonna film that
99:49 - soon but i will have
99:52 - the winners announced for you guys in
99:54 - probably a week
99:55 - i got to talk to my discord staff about
99:57 - that but
99:59 - for anyone wondering we're running a
100:00 - code jam right now in the discord server
100:02 - it's kind of like a hack
100:03 - well i don't want to call it a hackathon
100:04 - but it's like a long form of that you
100:06 - have like a month to work on a project
100:08 - you can be in a team
100:09 - i think it's up to four people we set
100:11 - but one of my mods will describe it in
100:12 - there
100:13 - um but that's like the idea and if you
100:16 - win
100:16 - you're actually going to get real cash
100:18 - prizes now i'm not going to tell you
100:20 - what they are yet because i want you to
100:21 - enter not because you want to win money
100:23 - but you will actually get money if you
100:25 - um
100:26 - if you are one of the winners so if
100:28 - you're in the first three teams
100:30 - i will give you money somehow we'll
100:34 - figure out how i'm gonna give that to
100:35 - you all right
100:35 - so i'm able to run it now i found a
100:38 - found a thing
100:40 - to do it with sweets
100:43 - and chassis fan 2 you're being plugged
100:46 - in
100:46 - awesome okay all right what else did i
100:50 - need to do
100:52 - front connectors and then we're done
100:54 - [Music]
100:55 - and then obviously i got to boot it up
100:57 - and then when it doesn't work that's
100:58 - going to be fun
100:59 - keep hitting my head on this mic i
101:01 - wonder if you guys can hear that
101:03 - next code gym is in october yeah yeah
101:05 - nexco jam is coming up it's coming up
101:06 - soon
101:07 - it's uh it'll be exciting though i'm
101:09 - looking forward to looking at the things
101:10 - i've like briefly looked through them
101:12 - it looks like you guys have made some
101:13 - pretty cool stuff so i'm actually really
101:15 - excited
101:15 - uh to do that youtube video and see what
101:17 - you guys came up with
101:18 - on what you guys are able to do okay so
101:22 - that's there keep forgetting i got to
101:24 - pull this cable out
101:26 - so hd audio goes
101:30 - in where over there okay
101:41 - this is like the worst way to hold this
101:44 - computer
101:46 - okay
101:49 - and come up here
101:58 - sweet
102:04 - i mean i don't even really need the hd
102:05 - audio on this but
102:08 - we'll plug it in just so i don't have to
102:09 - do this again
102:11 - okay sweet that's plugged in now we need
102:14 - usb 3
102:15 - and then all the uh
102:19 - i guess these are front panel but like
102:21 - all the power supply reset switch
102:24 - which i would probably need to refer to
102:25 - the motherboard manual for
102:27 - is i don't know where those go
102:30 - okay
102:36 - what are you guys saying i want to know
102:39 - how the server works
102:40 - i don't really know how to describe how
102:42 - the server works to be honest with you
102:44 - it's just like sits on the network my
102:47 - local network and i can transfer files
102:49 - between it and other things
102:50 - um usb 3.0 if anyone's ever built a
102:54 - computer
102:55 - and you probably understand me when i
102:57 - say how annoying it is to have to deal
102:59 - with usb 3.0 they make it like the
103:01 - thickest cable in the world it's so
103:03 - difficult
103:04 - to plug in without being seen
103:07 - all right so let's put that up here
103:14 - now all my lovely management is gone
103:15 - because i forgot about this guy
103:17 - okay maybe it'd be better
103:22 - if i ran it like that
103:25 - no this would be fine
103:36 - okay
103:40 - i just saw your tutorial on free code
103:42 - camp and that's what i can tell i don't
103:44 - know you guys are saying
103:45 - tim dono oh did someone donate let's see
103:49 - did i miss something oh just showing
103:51 - support really appreciate videos thank
103:53 - you keep it techy appreciate that keep
103:55 - it techy
103:56 - yeah sorry guys i uh not monitoring the
103:59 - chat as much to notice all the donations
104:02 - appreciate that thank you for the
104:04 - donation
104:06 - if you guys want to like ask a question
104:07 - or something i don't know if if you give
104:09 - a donation i will
104:10 - you know answer a question for you or
104:11 - something if that's what you that's what
104:13 - you're looking for
104:18 - okay hold that
104:23 - almost done i'm gonna show you guys the
104:24 - back in a second it looks
104:26 - keep in mind it looks a lot messier just
104:28 - due to the color of the cables
104:31 - um but it's it's pretty good i'm fairly
104:33 - happy with it
104:34 - let me see if i can cable tie this
104:37 - in a bit tighter
104:46 - okay
104:48 - come on cable tie there we go
105:00 - sweet tim what is the future of
105:03 - programming languages tim
105:05 - when did tim get a macbook i've had a
105:06 - macbook for a while
105:08 - uh i don't know what the future of
105:09 - programming languages is i have no idea
105:12 - i don't know what to tell you that
105:13 - python i have no idea
105:17 - i think there'll always be need for you
105:19 - know low-level programming
105:21 - language or low-level programmers i
105:22 - guess like c plus c
105:24 - all that um but i think it's moving more
105:26 - towards these modern languages that are
105:28 - just way
105:29 - faster to write code in not as not as
105:31 - good
105:32 - objectively in some areas but just a lot
105:35 - faster
105:42 - i need a new table this is a custom
105:44 - built table my dad actually built this
105:46 - for me
105:46 - um so i cannot really give you a
105:49 - recommendation and go buy some wood and
105:51 - a drill and a saw and go paint it and
105:54 - that's what we did
105:58 - create a live website with django a live
106:00 - website as opposed to a
106:01 - non-live website are you talking about
106:03 - like in production
106:05 - because i'm going to do something
106:06 - similar to that kind of soon
106:08 - tim you know you could answered a person
106:10 - with a more useful question i
106:12 - well i'm it's hard for me to find some
106:14 - good questions
106:15 - hey how do you learn some framework do
106:17 - you read the official docs yeah that's
106:18 - usually what i do
106:19 - i just mess around with the language bed
106:20 - or framework and then i do read the docs
106:28 - all right back side starting to look
106:30 - good
106:32 - yeah last thing is really these these
106:33 - front connectors
106:35 - probably gonna have to get the manual up
106:36 - though to figure out which pins are
106:39 - which
106:40 - oh and i gotta rewire this that cable
106:43 - okay that's fine
106:55 - you know i don't understand why they
106:57 - give cds i don't know anyone who has a
106:59 - cd drive in their computer
107:01 - and it's really just a pain like who
107:04 - uses a cd anymore to be honest
107:06 - okay front connectors let's look for
107:08 - this
107:10 - this is chassis fan one
107:13 - air pump cpu fan cpu fan
107:17 - optional okay
107:20 - i plug anything in there yes there we go
107:23 - good
107:27 - rgb header come on front panel where's
107:30 - the front panel
107:33 - oh maybe no it's not ants
107:47 - ah there we go found it let's see what
107:49 - what guys are saying here
107:50 - did i miss anything cds are useless
107:54 - who is psycho psycho is a friend of mine
107:57 - another streamer he should he should
107:59 - plug his stream you guys should go
108:00 - follow him um do you recommend starting
108:04 - with java
108:05 - java's good first programming language i
108:07 - mean might not be the most
108:08 - interesting one nice t-shirt where do
108:10 - you buy it link in description
108:14 - there this is it's also if you look in
108:15 - the chat i pinned this exact shirt that
108:17 - i'm wearing because i figured you guys
108:18 - would be asking that
108:20 - um okay
108:23 - system power let's start figuring this
108:30 - out
108:34 - hard drive led
108:37 - positive negative this
108:41 - does not tell me which side is which
108:44 - so i guess white would be positive and
108:47 - um
108:47 - is that right oh 199 how can i get
108:52 - into code all right i will take a second
108:54 - to answer that question
108:55 - um how do i get into code it's kind of
108:59 - vague you just got to
109:01 - he's got to start learning right i mean
109:03 - like what i would do is pick a language
109:05 - that you want to learn
109:05 - just go kind of do a little bit of
109:07 - research figure out what do you want to
109:09 - do like what do you want to do you want
109:10 - to make games do you want to just learn
109:11 - basic coding
109:13 - if you just want to like learn how to
109:14 - code you don't care about really like
109:16 - what you're doing with the code then
109:18 - python is a really easy language to
109:20 - learn i have like a whole course on my
109:22 - channel
109:22 - that can at least get you started on
109:24 - that it's six hours long
109:25 - but i would do a little research and
109:26 - figure out what you want to do do you
109:27 - want to make websites maybe you want to
109:29 - look into javascript
109:30 - but there's all kinds of resource online
109:32 - it's just about finding and practicing
109:34 - it
109:35 - if you have another thing i'll look for
109:36 - a follow-up for you but um
109:39 - that's uh kind of my answer for that
109:42 - it's a little vague
109:43 - now you have to tell them to start with
109:45 - your video yeah i mean
109:47 - watch my video you can watch someone
109:48 - else's video whatever you want um
109:50 - i'm trying to figure out black would be
109:53 - positive i feel like because that would
109:55 - maybe not an electrical engineer
109:59 - let's see i think that's right okay
110:03 - and what else do we have here power
110:07 - led power led
110:11 - positive negative
110:14 - ah so positive is white okay i was wrong
110:19 - negative is black
110:23 - let's swap that
110:30 - what is this one power switch that's
110:32 - going to be an important one to get
110:33 - right
110:35 - that is
110:38 - why does it not say switch power switch
110:42 - ground ah there we go got it and
110:52 - positive is gonna go power button
110:56 - i don't think it matters which one i do
110:58 - because i think it's just connecting
110:59 - them
111:00 - all right and then reset switch
111:04 - that is
111:18 - recent good
111:23 - p l e d p l e d
111:26 - all right let's see what you guys are
111:28 - saying
111:29 - are you near the finish yeah i'm really
111:31 - close to being done i'm like gonna boot
111:32 - it up in just a second
111:34 - um
111:37 - 216. you guys are still watching your
111:40 - your
111:40 - troopers here i know it's gotten a
111:42 - little bit more boring as we've gone
111:43 - through but
111:43 - i do actually need to focus enough to be
111:45 - able to let's just
111:47 - pull these cables straight you guys can
111:49 - see
111:50 - kind of what we're looking at here in
111:52 - terms of cables i don't know how
111:54 - it's hard for me to see i'm looking at
111:55 - like a little monitor for the computer
111:57 - but
111:58 - let me pull all these things
112:08 - all right
112:12 - and let's come on get through
112:16 - there we go okay
112:21 - those can just kind of tuck in the back
112:23 - there
112:24 - this needs to come through
112:30 - all right
112:34 - let's see what we're looking at okay i
112:37 - think that is
112:38 - is pretty much good
112:42 - now do i take the risk and take my
112:44 - camera off of the mount
112:45 - and start showing you guys that's
112:47 - probably not going to work so i'm going
112:48 - to say
112:49 - no but this is i think you guys can see
112:53 - i'll bring it a bit closer
112:54 - this is what it's looking like so far
112:57 - maybe
112:58 - maybe i can hold it up you guys you guys
113:00 - can see inside
113:01 - i think it looks pretty good the cables
113:02 - are pretty well managed this this fan
113:04 - cable is pretty annoying but
113:05 - it's not really much i can do about that
113:07 - hd audio you can kind of jam in there
113:10 - i'm going to cable tie those fan and it
113:13 - looks pretty good you don't really even
113:14 - see any cables other than
113:16 - there's a mustard one kind of hidden
113:17 - back there all right so backside
113:24 - that's what we're looking at for for
113:25 - cable management here
113:28 - so i don't think that's too bad at all
113:29 - kind of tucked in the back there there's
113:31 - a few loose cables in case i need them
113:32 - because this isn't modular
113:34 - uh and yeah i'm gonna put the back panel
113:36 - on now
113:37 - and yeah we'll boot it up actually
113:41 - should probably boot it up first just in
113:43 - case i need to fix something
113:45 - let's try it okay can we get it can we
113:47 - get a bet in the chat
113:49 - is this going to work what do you think
113:53 - yes no do we think tim did this
113:56 - correctly
113:59 - i won't be offended if you say no let's
114:01 - see
114:03 - power bar here
114:09 - oh i heard something any lights
114:12 - happening here
114:14 - oh there's a light on the motherboard
114:16 - that could be a good sign
114:17 - okay let's let's let's see
114:21 - are we ready for me to press the power
114:22 - button i want to see what you guys are
114:23 - saying
114:24 - but yes yes what do we think hopefully
114:28 - hopefully tim your t-shirts are the best
114:30 - appreciate that
114:31 - totally going to blow up guys if the
114:33 - camera shuts off you know what happened
114:35 - to me
114:37 - uh yeah i'm just reusing fans i i know i
114:40 - could use the same size but i'm just
114:41 - reusing fans that i had so
114:43 - um i could actually put another black
114:45 - 140 in the front i'm not gonna do that
114:47 - though okay let's see
114:48 - what are we saying yes all right i'm
114:50 - pressing the button
114:58 - good seems to be working
115:01 - all right i'm going to plug in a monitor
115:05 - now
115:05 - actually i'm gonna use this one i have
115:07 - an hdmi i can steal
115:08 - let's see if it boots
115:16 - okay
115:30 - let's see i don't see anything yet but
115:32 - it's like a grayish screen
115:34 - so maybe
115:39 - oh i'm not getting anything guys this
115:41 - could be bad
115:42 - maybe it's not coming out of hdmi maybe
115:44 - it is there do i have to
115:46 - like would it come out a displayport by
115:48 - default i have a displayport cable one
115:49 - second let me check that
115:51 - this could be bad we'll see though
116:56 - all right i have located a display
116:58 - displayport cable
117:00 - um it does have an onboard graphics card
117:09 - yeah it has an on board i made sure
117:10 - before i bought it uh displayport though
117:13 - let's try that
117:14 - i don't know if it auto detect like
117:16 - sometimes it only comes out at one point
117:17 - i've had that happen before but let's
117:22 - see
117:40 - hmm all right guys oh
117:43 - no i'm gonna try turning it off and back
117:47 - on
117:47 - let's let's just let's just see what
117:49 - that does for us
117:51 - did this turn off okay so i don't even
117:53 - know what the problem would be because
117:54 - the thing is
117:55 - it's like it literally would just be the
117:58 - ram slot is the only thing i could
118:00 - change or the cpu is not installed
118:01 - correctly or something but i
118:02 - 100 put in there right um
118:06 - so let's see
118:14 - maybe it's just maybe it's the monitor
118:16 - who knows oh
118:18 - i got a green light
118:23 - okay
118:26 - this is gonna be fun this doesn't work
118:43 - oh i got it guys we're good my screen is
118:46 - vertical though
118:47 - so it's like impossible for me to
118:49 - actually see it
118:50 - i'm just going to get a keyboard and i'm
118:52 - going to just boot in and make sure that
118:54 - i don't crash or anything but it
118:55 - actually is working so
118:57 - good news and then i'll put the side
118:58 - panels on
119:12 - okay i'm actually going to take a minute

119:15 - this is
119:16 - really a mess and this is gonna be hard
119:17 - to do i need to keep
119:19 - all this okay
119:26 - we're good we're good i was getting a
119:27 - little nervous there i'm not gonna lie
119:29 - i uh that could have been really bad
119:32 - [Laughter]
119:36 - i promise it's i someone's saying i'm
119:37 - lying i promise it's working i can't
119:39 - actually show you but it is on i
119:41 - wouldn't be this
119:41 - i wouldn't be smiling if that wasn't the
119:43 - case uh okay let's put those in there
119:53 - let's put away some garbage i i wish you
119:56 - guys could see under my desk there's so
119:58 - much stuff right now it's um
120:00 - not great okay where should i put all
120:04 - this stuff
120:24 - so
120:40 - all right one second i'm just gonna
120:42 - start doing a little cleanup here
120:46 - before i get everything set up
120:55 - what's the chat saying are you guys uh
120:57 - fun fact
120:58 - tim actually needs the vertical screen
121:00 - to read his youtube chat
121:01 - well this screen isn't um i know what
121:04 - you mean but this
121:05 - is not the one that i would use for that
121:09 - okay let's put away some of these
121:10 - screwdrivers
121:14 - let's go i show us never mind maybe i
121:17 - will
121:18 - try to show you this is gonna be if the
121:20 - hdmi disconnects and the stream goes
121:22 - blank
121:23 - you're just understand i told you guys
121:25 - that was gonna happen
121:27 - i will uh i'll try to show you though
121:31 - okay don't need these anymore
121:44 - [Music]
121:49 - all right i'm officially picking up the
121:51 - camera
121:52 - this is not oh i've already made a
121:55 - critical mistake this is not gonna go
121:56 - well
121:57 - i know you guys can hardly hear me but
122:02 - there's no way i'm gonna be able to do
122:03 - this let's see can you guys see this
122:06 - this is as far as i can go
122:10 - i'm watching myself lag i don't know if
122:12 - you guys can see the screen or not
122:13 - that's the furthest i can go but that
122:15 - that's the bios screen
122:17 - if if you guys can see it
122:20 - okay maybe this is not let's see i want
122:22 - to tilt now maybe you guys
122:24 - no no okay i'm going back this was
122:27 - this is a big risk already
122:32 - and now you're gonna be on like a
122:33 - completely different angle
122:35 - uh let's see if that's good i'm gonna
122:39 - have to keep going back and forth now
122:40 - because the display on this is off
122:43 - uh will people be able to see me
122:46 - let's see how's this how's this angle oh
122:50 - i've messed my screen up
122:53 - oh maybe even
122:56 - better no i need to change it a little
122:59 - bit
123:06 - okay i think
123:09 - that's good
123:17 - okay i'm back let's see what this was
123:21 - uh let's see what you guys said
123:24 - so it does work oh i thought you were
123:26 - coding something i can see it a little
123:29 - make a room tour no stop
123:32 - camera may fall yeah that was uh see you
123:35 - guys
123:39 - okay oh that was funny all right i think
123:42 - yeah i think we're
123:43 - good i'm showing too much of this area
123:45 - but that's fine i don't think you guys
123:46 - care about anyways this is my keyboard i
123:48 - wanted to show you guys
123:49 - it's uh like a roll up keyboard for
123:52 - precisely this reason
123:53 - so i'm gonna just boot in and just press
123:56 - f1
123:57 - and see if this is all gonna work and
124:00 - then i'll put the side panels on
124:03 - okay f1 enter setup
124:09 - sweet now you're gonna see me doing this
124:12 - oh the cpu is hot 46
124:15 - idle okay
124:20 - memory eight gigs i gotta change that
124:23 - okay i'm gonna do this stuff after i
124:24 - want to bore you guys with this i'm
124:25 - gonna put the panels on
124:27 - and let's see what this case looks like
124:30 - uh
124:30 - completed so first of all i don't even
124:32 - know which
124:34 - what display did i even plug into this
124:36 - which one is being
124:39 - what is it going off of hdmi so i didn't
124:41 - need the display port okay
124:45 - all right unplug that
124:50 - and unplug that turn this off
125:02 - all right side panel time
125:05 - the question is which is the front okay
125:08 - i think i know
125:18 - it's like the only time i put a side
125:20 - panel on and it hasn't like squished
125:22 - every single cable inside
125:26 - okay i'm actually gonna is this off yeah
125:29 - disconnect this okay
125:37 - all right i'll give you guys one last
125:38 - peek inside before i put the side panel
125:40 - on
125:41 - i know it's like all crooked but that's
125:42 - the easiest way i can show you that's
125:44 - what it looks like
125:45 - for a server well
125:48 - yeah i guess file server i think it
125:50 - looks pretty good
125:53 - what is a file server it is a machine
125:55 - that holds files and just think of it as
125:57 - like a uh
125:58 - you know i don't even like a database
126:00 - for videos that's kind of what i'm using
126:02 - it for
126:04 - [Music]
126:06 - all right and are we locked and loaded
126:09 - here
126:10 - almost
126:13 - boom side panel on
126:17 - how do i take that off i don't know
126:22 - perfect okay let's screw these guys in
126:26 - so another one up there yep
126:36 - how many terabytes right now this has
126:38 - six terabytes
126:44 - i don't know i have these two screws i
126:46 - don't know where they go though
126:48 - oh ah there i got to take the panel off
126:52 - i forgot there's some screws in here
126:54 - that i need to put in
126:56 - i forgot that's okay that makes sense
126:59 - that makes a lot of sense
127:03 - it's uh six terabytes in total each
127:05 - drives three drives they're each
127:07 - two terabytes
127:12 - that is our screw hole there
127:17 - i don't even know it was there was
127:19 - something that i had to screw in here
127:22 - oh no wait that's the thing i detached
127:24 - never mind i don't need to take the side
127:26 - panel off
127:30 - i can't stop thinking about the
127:31 - minecraft server i'm not promising a
127:33 - minecraft server
127:35 - but i would be really down to have one
127:38 - we'd have to run it through my discord
127:40 - though
127:40 - so just keep that in mind tim pixel
127:42 - that's a good name i just saw someone
127:44 - say that that's hilarious
127:52 - okay
128:02 - sweet let's get the scissors out of the
128:03 - way
128:05 - and let's have a look
128:08 - at this now okay so you guys can see the
128:11 - front obviously
128:12 - this front has this cool thing i didn't
128:13 - realize you can actually if i
128:16 - can figure out how to open it i think
128:17 - it's here here it is
128:19 - there's this cool thing so you can
128:21 - actually see the the front fan grill i
128:23 - guess that's where the
128:24 - yeah different colored fans are and
128:26 - different size fans
128:28 - shh we don't care we're not gonna look
128:30 - at that in the filter
128:31 - i guess that's the cover for the drive
128:33 - bay
128:34 - uh and yeah that's kind of cool i didn't
128:37 - know it has that there's some like sound
128:39 - insulation i think you guys can see that
128:41 - we got on the front i o that's kind of
128:44 - what it looks like
128:46 - i've got you know the headphone jack
128:48 - audio all that
128:50 - and i guess i mean this is the other
128:51 - side it's literally just
128:53 - just black there's room for a fan here i
128:56 - think i can pop that off
128:58 - and at the top actually don't know what
129:01 - these things at the top are for
129:02 - i think i can take them off it might not
129:04 - be a bad idea to take them off actually
129:06 - um just because i want some more airflow
129:08 - in here
129:09 - i have more fans too that i technically
129:11 - could mount i might not though
129:14 - okay so that's how you take this off so
129:17 - these just pop in
129:19 - whoops let's try to get this off
129:22 - probably not the
129:23 - best way to do this with a knife but
129:27 - hopefully this will work let's see there
129:30 - we go
129:31 - yeah so it might not be a bad idea to
129:33 - just leave one of these
129:34 - off uh there will be some dust that gets
129:37 - in
129:38 - but i can actually put more fans what do
129:40 - you guys think would a top
129:42 - exhaust fan be worth it do you think i
129:44 - should do that um
129:46 - let's see what everyone's saying here
129:48 - can you make a tutorial on apis for
129:50 - websites i don't have one
129:51 - maybe if you made an mc server i'd love
129:53 - to help with the map in the world sure
129:55 - yeah
129:55 - if i do that i'll set up like staff like
129:58 - it'll be proper i used to actually run a
130:00 - minecraft server when i was younger
130:01 - when i was like 14 i think i had maybe
130:04 - like 20 or 30 concurrent players on it
130:06 - like at most times
130:07 - and it was actually pretty successful so
130:09 - i have a general idea of what i'm doing
130:11 - but things have changed a lot since i
130:12 - did that
130:13 - positive pressure remember yeah i know i
130:15 - have two
130:17 - yeah i only have two intake fans
130:22 - let's see water cooling probably not if
130:25 - the thermals aren't a problem yeah i
130:26 - don't think the thermals will be a
130:27 - problem
130:28 - um yeah i'm not gonna do it
130:32 - i'm a beginner programmer if it wasn't
130:33 - for you and keith
130:36 - galles i don't know how that is
130:37 - tutorials i don't think i would have
130:38 - gone as far so thank you no problem
130:40 - how old are you i'm 20 when did you
130:42 - start programming when i was 12
130:43 - a long time ago uh let's see what
130:46 - everyone else is saying
130:47 - how much do you cost
130:50 - um i don't know let's just say i'm
130:52 - priceless how about that
131:00 - all right so we just passed a two hour
131:01 - mark i'm pretty much done though
131:03 - um i mean there is obviously all the
131:05 - setup and stuff i have to do
131:06 - i don't really want to do that on stream
131:08 - um it's gonna be hard
131:10 - too and i'm not gonna be sitting on this
131:11 - computer like in this frame for a while
131:13 - come on go in jesus thing
131:17 - there we go that is way too hard to push
131:21 - in that's okay
131:22 - so i'm actually thinking that i'm gonna
131:25 - end the stream
131:27 - now if you guys have any last questions
131:30 - i'll stay on and just look at the chat
131:32 - um but yeah otherwise
131:35 - i'm gonna end this kind of soon so last
131:37 - questions i'll give you guys like two
131:38 - three minutes if you want to ask
131:40 - something or you want to just chat or
131:41 - whatever and then i am going to hop off
131:43 - but a big thank you to everyone who
131:45 - joined the stream really do appreciate
131:47 - you guys coming on
131:48 - i've had a good time hanging out with
131:49 - you guys and i will do some more
131:51 - streams at some point in time but they
131:53 - are like pretty
131:54 - like this is not the easiest thing to
131:56 - run and it's kind of stressful right
131:58 - yeah you know 300 400 people watching
131:59 - you
132:00 - uh every mistake you make just letting
132:02 - you know which is a good and bad thing
132:04 - lots of respect for you do you
132:05 - appreciate that seven oh my god you guys
132:08 - are fast oh i did not realize how many
132:09 - questions i was gonna get um
132:12 - okay i'm gonna have to slow this down
132:15 - do you think learning data science is
132:16 - good idea nowadays yeah i think it's a
132:18 - good idea i mean
132:19 - i think like worst case you get good at
132:20 - data science and then you're good at
132:22 - data science you can carry that skill
132:24 - over to
132:24 - something else as well so i think
132:26 - definitely and there is a huge focus on
132:28 - uh data nowadays right let's see
132:32 - um are you gonna make any ethical
132:37 - hacking videos
132:38 - i'm not very experienced with that maybe
132:40 - uh
132:41 - i'll look into it because i've got
132:43 - gotten asked that question a lot
132:45 - make a stream about programming this i'm
132:48 - not going to write any code for this i
132:49 - don't
132:50 - think hopefully not so maybe that's not
132:52 - really an option
132:53 - yeah if you guys are here please do like
132:55 - this stream i would appreciate that
132:57 - you got to be more active in discord
132:58 - server tim it's hard guys i'm always
133:00 - filming videos it's hard to
133:02 - do you know this is my most engagement
133:04 - when i do a stream
133:05 - are you planning on doing more
133:06 - javascript tutorials maybe probably not
133:09 - post full spec list um that's not a bad
133:12 - idea
133:13 - actually uh i will go through the specs
133:15 - quickly it's a ryzen 5
133:17 - 3 400 g so it has a graphics unit in it
133:20 - someone said i got scammed when i bought
133:21 - it i don't know how much it was so you
133:22 - guys can look it up eight gigs of ram
133:24 - they're 33 000 megahertz
133:27 - i have four two terabyte uh hard drives
133:30 - in there
133:30 - and then what else do i have uh i guess
133:33 - that's
133:34 - about it i mean i have like a where's
133:36 - the motherboard box
133:38 - a rog strix b450f
133:42 - gaming motherboard and this case
133:45 - is the fractal design
133:48 - divine r5 i totally didn't just look at
133:51 - the case box to tell you that
133:53 - 400 watt power supply is inside of here
133:55 - it actually has enough power that i
133:57 - could put a graphics card in it if i
133:58 - want
133:59 - uh not a huge one but and yeah as i said
134:01 - it's about 900 canadian dollars
134:03 - i'm actually 20. i'm not 19. thanks for
134:06 - the stream take care yeah you too
134:08 - where can i practice for python like
134:10 - python projects you just gotta
134:11 - do your own stuff come up with something
134:13 - that you want to make and practice it
134:15 - uh 10 years old and can bench a thousand
134:18 - pounds congratulations do you have a
134:19 - girlfriend no i do not have a girlfriend
134:21 - um computer engineering versus computer
134:24 - science
134:25 - if you would prefer software and you
134:27 - want to work
134:28 - i don't know i would personally
134:29 - recommend computer science computer
134:31 - engineering is much more
134:32 - hardware level i think it's fun you do
134:34 - software stuff as well but it's much
134:36 - more
134:37 - electrical engineering-ish right like
134:39 - you're learning about lower level
134:40 - components
134:41 - i'm actually designing say like you know
134:44 - boards or you're designing like this
134:45 - physical motherboard or something
134:47 - i'm not experienced in computer
134:48 - engineering but that's my understanding
134:50 - of it
134:50 - computer science is much more just
134:52 - theoretical programming stuff so if you
134:54 - like
134:54 - that more you'd want to work more in
134:56 - like high-tech
134:57 - companies they're hiring more computer
134:59 - scientists than computer engineers from
135:01 - what i understand that could be wrong
135:04 - um have you ever been ta no suggestion
135:06 - for getting an
135:07 - internship what is let me see where this
135:11 - is
135:11 - at 17. be tough to be honest with you
135:15 - you just have to be extraordinary right
135:16 - you got to point your like
135:19 - i don't know sell yourself right on your
135:20 - resume don't
135:22 - put the fact that you're 17 there try to
135:24 - get an interview and get hired
135:25 - and then tell them you're 17 right i
135:28 - wouldn't advertise the fact that you
135:29 - were 17 unless they ask you that and i
135:31 - don't think they're actually
135:32 - allowed to ask you that but maybe you
135:33 - have to be older than 18.
135:35 - but same tips i would give to anyone
135:37 - just you got to do more because you're
135:38 - younger right and it's harder
135:40 - how do you make a chat server using
135:41 - python i have a video talking about
135:43 - online multiplayer game
135:45 - or i have a socket video sorry socket
135:46 - tutorial that shows you how to do that
135:49 - will you make the file transfer system
135:50 - using python i don't need to make a
135:52 - system there's stuff that exists to do
135:54 - that
135:55 - are you going to record a video on how
135:56 - to set up server probably not i'm 20.
135:59 - what's your main interest in coding i
136:00 - like backend development
136:02 - what's the file server for storing
136:04 - youtube videos
136:06 - um can you create some tutorials
136:09 - projects with javascript maybe i'm gonna
136:11 - do like a social media site thing that
136:13 - will probably use javascript
136:14 - any books on machine learning you
136:16 - recommend no i don't really read
136:17 - programming books
136:19 - um hey i'm 14 watching your videos since
136:22 - i was 12. wow
136:23 - you've been watching for a long time
136:24 - appreciate it thank you for the videos
136:25 - no thank you for the comment
136:27 - can you do tutorials in the command line
136:29 - in the future i don't know what that
136:31 - means i'm going to skip
136:32 - that can i make a trained model as an
136:35 - api arrest
136:36 - with an android app as a front end yes
136:39 - you can
136:40 - what documentation can i look up i don't
136:43 - know the answer to that you're just
136:44 - going to have to kind of problem solve
136:45 - on your own but i know you 100 could do
136:46 - that
136:47 - make c plus videos no probably not uh
136:50 - what would you like to do after python
136:52 - programming
136:53 - not sure i like typescript react
136:54 - honestly i had a good time programming
136:56 - that for microsoft
136:58 - uh you already asked me that question
136:59 - would skip that hey i'm 13 and what
137:01 - should i do with machine learning i have
137:02 - a video about getting started with
137:03 - machine learning you can watch that
137:05 - tim why don't you do software
137:06 - engineering at uottawa and do co-op
137:08 - first year um
137:09 - that was a good honestly i probably
137:10 - should have done software engineering uh
137:12 - but i just was in computer science so i
137:14 - don't really have an answer for you
137:16 - uh have you ever modded a game before
137:20 - trying to think i used to jailbreak
137:22 - iphones when i was really young so maybe
137:24 - that counts
137:25 - uh html css sql count as programming
137:27 - languages i'm going to say
137:28 - no um anthony
137:32 - fiskus giving five dollars i appreciate
137:34 - it appreciate it thank you no comment
137:35 - but really thank you for the support
137:37 - appreciate that
137:38 - i t interview tips i have a video on
137:40 - that uh will you make the file transfer
137:41 - no i already answered that
137:43 - can you make more tutorials mongodb i
137:45 - have one coming up actually
137:47 - uh thank you for your videos is os is
137:50 - the os linux yes
137:51 - how can you read this i'm literate i
137:54 - don't know
137:55 - what is the average size of your videos
137:56 - like two to three gigabytes probably
137:58 - but i am potentially going to move into
137:59 - 4k videos at some point so this is kind
138:01 - of like a preparation step
138:03 - it's not necessarily necessary right now
138:06 - um you learn programming just through
138:07 - youtube i actually learn almost
138:09 - everything i know about programming at
138:10 - least when i started through youtube
138:12 - videos
138:12 - specifically uh the new boston was the
138:14 - channel i watched a lot
138:16 - all right i'm getting tired here i'll do
138:18 - a few more and then i'm gonna sign off
138:19 - um i'm gonna kind of pick some though
138:27 - why'd you stop making checkers i didn't
138:29 - checkers is coming out
138:30 - again i just took a break from it
138:31 - because sometimes it gets a little
138:33 - repetitive the same video constantly on
138:35 - the channel especially if it's long
138:36 - series so i like to sprinkle other stuff
138:38 - in between
138:39 - um if i want to make a gui with a
138:41 - beautiful design in libraries you
138:42 - recommend what do you recommend in
138:44 - python
138:45 - it's hard to make anything like
138:46 - beautiful in python maybe there's an
138:48 - answer to that
138:49 - i would recommend use another language
138:51 - like use a javascript framework
138:53 - front-end thing
138:54 - um let's see
139:02 - what do you think python will be like in
139:04 - 2025
139:06 - i don't know i don't think it's gonna
139:07 - change that much i think that
139:09 - it will continue to be used a lot but i
139:11 - think there'll probably be some newer
139:12 - languages that
139:13 - i don't wanna say replace but do a
139:15 - similar thing to what python does
139:17 - um so i don't know i don't wanna say
139:19 - it's going to plateau but i think at
139:20 - some point
139:21 - the growth will kind of taper off if
139:23 - that's what you're asking about if
139:24 - you're talking about like the language
139:25 - features i have no idea
139:27 - i have no clue you got to go to like
139:28 - picon or something and listen to the
139:29 - talks
139:30 - um we'd recommend python as a first
139:34 - programming language yes
139:36 - uh bye see you later uh this
139:39 - became chat with viewers yeah i know but
139:41 - that was kind of the point of this tim
139:42 - what is a good language to learn after
139:43 - python
139:44 - i think javascript is a good complement
139:45 - to python um
139:47 - is it true that programming mac is
139:49 - better than doing it on windows that's
139:50 - subjective it's up to you depends on
139:52 - what you're doing i would say a
139:53 - unix-based machine is usually better for
139:55 - programming
139:56 - in terms like installation setup stuff
139:58 - like that but there is advantages to
139:59 - using windows especially if you're using
140:01 - like c c plus plus c sharp objective c
140:03 - or not objective c maybe i don't i don't
140:06 - know enough about that to give you an
140:07 - answer on that one but i know like using
140:08 - the microsoft languages is probably
140:10 - better on windows
140:11 - uh what's your laptop name and model i
140:13 - have the macbook pro 16 inch base model
140:15 - with
140:16 - some random upgrade i forget what i did
140:18 - on it uh
140:20 - do you plan on making videos with react
140:22 - and flask maybe that's kind of hard to
140:23 - do
140:24 - why you make pie qd5 detail tutorials
140:28 - similar to decanters
140:30 - would you make pie qt5 detail tutorials
140:32 - similar to
140:33 - uh from code emmy's channel
140:37 - i just can't even read today so i'm
140:38 - gonna skip that question i don't even
140:40 - know who code
140:41 - codemy is that what it is i don't know
140:43 - what that is uh
140:47 - all right last question when are you
140:49 - gonna stop cutting your hair
140:50 - never i like my hair short yeah everyone
140:52 - always says that stop cutting hair i
140:54 - i prefer prefer to be short it's just i
140:56 - don't want to say like it's difficult to
140:58 - take care of when it gets long but i
140:59 - just think it looks cleaner when it's
141:00 - short
141:01 - okay anyways that is where i'm going to
141:03 - end so i appreciate everyone that
141:05 - stopped into this stream
141:06 - if you're watching it after well i hope
141:08 - you enjoyed i know this was a lot more
141:10 - of me talking than it was building a
141:12 - computer but that was kind of the point
141:13 - i figured you know
141:14 - let's have something that's kind of fun
141:15 - tech related let me just chat with you
141:17 - guys and if you're going to take the
141:18 - time out of your day to come here
141:19 - at least i can answer some of your
