00:00 - I'm going to share with you three
00:01 - incredible opportunities for developers
00:03 - in the e-commerce space now these are
00:06 - projects that would look fantastic on
00:08 - your resume and if you decided to build
00:10 - all the way to production could actually
00:12 - make you a ton of money and be a million
00:14 - dooll project idea now the e-commerce
00:17 - space is one of the largest Industries
00:19 - in the world and most of the big players
00:21 - are actually tech companies I think
00:23 - Shopify Amazon Walmart Etc now I know
00:27 - this because I flew all the way to Las
00:29 - Vegas to and Shop talk 2024 when I was
00:32 - there I talked with some of the largest
00:34 - companies and I asked them what kind of
00:36 - developer Talent they were looking for
00:38 - now the biggest topic that kept popping
00:40 - up was data and the e-commerce space
00:42 - data is so important and these companies
00:44 - told me that they're constantly looking
00:46 - for developers that know how to collect
00:48 - data manage it and analyze it so if you
00:50 - can demonstrate those skills you're
00:52 - really going to stand out and that's
00:54 - what's inspired this video so with that
00:56 - said let's get into them
01:00 - now for each of the projects I share
01:01 - with you I'm going to break down what
01:03 - the idea is and then I'm going to give
01:05 - you how I would go about building this
01:07 - project but truthfully for all of these
01:09 - projects you're going to need a lot of
01:11 - data specifically web data which means
01:13 - you're going to need to build out some
01:14 - web scrapers now there's a lot of
01:16 - different ways to do this but when
01:17 - you're building up these web scrapers if
01:19 - you want to scale them up and actually
01:21 - collect hundreds or thousands of pages
01:23 - of data you're probably going to run
01:25 - into a lot of issues for example you may
01:27 - have captures that are blocking you you
01:29 - may get rate limited you may have your
01:31 - IP address banned if you hit a website
01:32 - too many times and that's where the
01:34 - sponsor of this video bright data comes
01:36 - in now I've worked with bright data for
01:38 - over 3 years and genuinely they're the
01:40 - only tool that I know that can solve all
01:43 - of these issues bright data provides a
01:45 - bunch of different tools from their web
01:46 - unlocker to their scraping browser which
01:48 - can automatically unblock websites for
01:51 - you and allow you to do web scraping at
01:53 - scale I've done a bunch of projects on
01:55 - my channel where I've showed you how to
01:56 - use those I'll link some on the screen
01:58 - right now but the idea is you can
02:00 - actually scale out you can use their
02:02 - automated browsers and you can control
02:04 - them from your local machine with
02:06 - Frameworks that you already know like
02:07 - selenium playwright and Puppeteer now
02:10 - I'll talk more about them in this video
02:11 - when we discuss how to build the web
02:13 - scrapers to collect this data but if you
02:15 - are trying to do web scraping at scale
02:17 - definitely check them out from the link
02:19 - in the description so with that said
02:21 - let's dive in the first
02:25 - project so the first thing I would
02:27 - consider building is a competitive price
02:29 - monitoring and optimization system now
02:32 - in the e-commerce field prices are
02:33 - constantly changing companies are
02:35 - running promotions items are going out
02:37 - of stock and it would shock you how many
02:39 - times the same product is available for
02:41 - a different price across different
02:43 - websites obviously as a business having
02:45 - access that information would be
02:47 - extremely important and allow you to
02:49 - adjust your prices based on it so the
02:51 - idea here is to build some kind of tool
02:53 - that can continuously collect this data
02:55 - so maybe you're going to track one
02:57 - specific product or a few different
02:58 - products that are competing across
03:00 - different sites you're going to track
03:02 - what the current price is you can also
03:03 - track information like the inventory
03:05 - level promotions Etc this way you can
03:08 - build some kind of dashboard and you can
03:10 - display all of the different prices for
03:12 - this product and give a business the
03:14 - ability to dynamically adjust their
03:16 - pricing based on the prices of competing
03:19 - products now you could build out some
03:20 - tool that automatically does the
03:22 - adjustment or applies or recommend some
03:24 - kind of price but at minimum having
03:26 - access to that information having a
03:28 - dashboard that shows it and being able
03:30 - to update in real time would be
03:31 - absolutely invaluable now I'm not going
03:34 - to say this is easy to build out but
03:35 - this would be something that would look
03:37 - fantastic on a resume and if you
03:39 - actually built it all the way out and
03:40 - made sure it could scale this would be
03:42 - something you could sell especially to
03:43 - maybe smaller businesses that don't have
03:45 - access to these huge tools and make a
03:47 - ton of money from so let me break down
03:50 - how you can go about building this
03:51 - project to kind of give you a head start
03:53 - if you do want to try it out so for this
03:55 - project you'll have to build out a few
03:56 - different things but where I would start
03:58 - is by building the web scrapers now I
04:00 - say scrapers because you're going to
04:02 - need to build a different one for every
04:04 - site that you want to scrape so maybe
04:06 - there's three or four targets that you
04:07 - want to look at maybe you want to look
04:08 - at Walmart Amazon Wayfair New Egg
04:11 - whatever you want to look at you're
04:12 - going to have to build out a scraper for
04:14 - all of those different sites and you
04:16 - want to build one that's Dynamic that
04:17 - can take in some kind of search string
04:19 - or some kind of text and then go to that
04:22 - site and find items that match that
04:24 - filter that way you don't need to build
04:26 - a different scraper for every different
04:28 - product you just build one that works
04:29 - Works generally for a specific site and
04:32 - then you can make it so it can scrape
04:33 - all the different pages or it can just
04:34 - scrape maybe the first product that
04:36 - appears in that result there's a bunch
04:38 - of different ways to set this up but the
04:39 - idea is you want to build a scraper that
04:41 - can go to a site and collect data on
04:43 - individual products now how do you do
04:45 - that well there's a few different ways
04:47 - uh I would personally use a framework
04:49 - like selenium but you could also use
04:50 - something like playwright or Puppeteer
04:52 - where you're actually going to automate
04:54 - the browser you might need to control it
04:55 - by maybe searching something rendering
04:57 - some Dynamic content and then you have
04:59 - to go through the Dom so the document
05:01 - object model all the HTML and search for
05:04 - specific Target elements and extract the
05:06 - data you want from it now in development
05:08 - when you're testing out you can probably
05:10 - just do this from your local machine but
05:11 - if you do want to scale this up or you
05:13 - want to be hitting the page maybe every
05:14 - five or 10 seconds you are going to need
05:16 - to push this out to some kind of
05:18 - infrastructure and this is where I would
05:19 - recommend using something like bright
05:21 - data that make it super easy just to
05:23 - spin up a remote browser that browser
05:25 - can do the scraping and then give the
05:27 - results back to you and you can have as
05:28 - many instan of them running as you want
05:31 - so rather than being limited to the few
05:32 - instances that you could run on your
05:34 - local machine you could literally spin
05:35 - up 10,000 bright data browsers that can
05:38 - go collect the data and they'll
05:40 - automatically bypass all of the blocks
05:42 - that you'll probably run into locally
05:44 - like captas um IP bands all the
05:47 - different things that you're bound to
05:48 - see if you do actually try to build out
05:50 - a project like that now once we have the
05:52 - scrapers built out and we can collect
05:54 - data on different products we need to
05:55 - store that data so we're probably going
05:57 - to dump it in some kind of database and
05:59 - then we'll want to build a dashboard so
06:01 - probably a nice front end build it in
06:02 - whatever you're comfortable with where
06:04 - we can see maybe a history of the prices
06:06 - that'd be useful especially if we're
06:07 - collecting that data anyways and then
06:09 - we'd want maybe a comparison of the same
06:12 - product on different uh websites right
06:14 - so just a nice table where we could see
06:16 - those prices from there you could go a
06:18 - step further and integrate this into a
06:19 - system where it automatically updates
06:21 - prices but I would probably just make it
06:23 - so it recommends a price for your
06:25 - product based on the prices of the other
06:27 - product now beyond that there's a lot
06:29 - more that you could do but what you're
06:31 - going to want to set up here is some
06:32 - kind of automation where you're running
06:34 - your browsers every few minutes or every
06:36 - hour or Whatever frequency you want so
06:38 - you're getting relatively upto-date data
06:41 - it's not going to be possible to run it
06:42 - like every millisecond or every two
06:44 - seconds but maybe you want to run it
06:45 - every 12 hours every 6 hours whatever
06:48 - time period you think is reasonable it
06:50 - will go out scrape the data collect it
06:52 - and then show you that real upto-date
06:55 - information now my next idea would be to
06:58 - build a customer sentiment and
06:59 - satisfaction analysis platform the idea
07:03 - here is rather than looking at prices we
07:05 - want to look at reviews and ratings this
07:08 - way we can actually analyze the
07:09 - sentiment of them using natural language
07:12 - processing and we can figure out which
07:13 - products people like and which they
07:15 - don't like we can also take all of these
07:17 - reviews we could actually run them into
07:19 - something like an llm and we could ask
07:21 - the llm to give us what the general
07:23 - opinion and feedback is we could
07:25 - actually get a written response on maybe
07:27 - improvements we could make to this
07:29 - product to make it better to increase
07:31 - the sales get better reviews Etc so this
07:33 - tool would be great because it could do
07:35 - two things for us it can tell us where
07:37 - there's a gap in the market and where we
07:38 - could make a new product that would fill
07:40 - that Gap or we could run it on our own
07:43 - products and we could see which ones are
07:45 - performing well which ones are poor and
07:47 - how we can improve existing ones that we
07:49 - already have so there's a lot of
07:50 - different use cases here but this is
07:52 - unique because we're getting outside of
07:54 - price and we're really doing kind of a
07:56 - mixture of data collection and then
07:58 - sentiment analysis which really is
08:00 - pretty impressive and if you have this
08:01 - on a resume it gives you a lot to talk
08:03 - about and it's something that really
08:05 - does fill a real business need so let's
08:08 - talk about how you could build out a
08:09 - project like this now I could just do
08:11 - something basic where I get if it's a
08:13 - positive sentiment or a negative
08:14 - sentiment what I think would be really
08:16 - interesting is if I actually took all of
08:18 - the different comments or the reviews
08:20 - and I passed it to a model something
08:22 - like chat GPT or something that's
08:23 - running locally on my computer and I
08:25 - asked it to summarize what the overall
08:28 - sentiment was this way I can actually
08:30 - get some more actionable um kind of
08:32 - feedback or I can get some string of
08:34 - text that tells me generally what people
08:36 - are thinking about this product so
08:38 - rather than just seeing that it's a
08:39 - three out of five or that people think
08:41 - it's good or bad I can see what people
08:44 - are mostly saying about it so maybe
08:45 - there's one defect and chat gbt kind of
08:47 - finds that and summarizes it for me I
08:49 - think that'd be a really interesting way
08:51 - to go about solving this problem anyways
08:54 - once I have the sentiment or I have that
08:55 - summary of what people are saying about
08:57 - the product what I would want to do
08:59 - obviously store that so I need some kind
09:01 - of database I'd probably use something
09:02 - like mongod DB and then I'm going to
09:04 - build some kind of dashboard that would
09:06 - allow me to view all of this information
09:08 - I think the really cool component here
09:10 - would be to get that kind of summary of
09:11 - what people generally are saying or
09:13 - thinking about the product that's going
09:15 - to give you a lot more insight than just
09:16 - a review number or manually having to go
09:19 - through and read all of the different
09:21 - reviews so that's project idea number
09:23 - two let's get into the third
09:26 - one so that leads me to my last idea
09:29 - which is definitely the most difficult
09:31 - but also the one I think has real
09:33 - potential and could make a ton of money
09:35 - now this is a crossplatform product
09:38 - tracker and affiliate aggregator now let
09:40 - me just give you an example of where you
09:42 - would use this so you can see kind of
09:44 - how it works and what the benefit would
09:45 - be so let's say that I'm a YouTuber
09:47 - right as I am a lot of you guys ask me
09:49 - what's your microphone what's your
09:51 - keyboard you want to know my gear so
09:53 - naturally what I would do is set up a
09:54 - page that has some different affiliate
09:55 - links on it and I would just probably go
09:57 - and use something like Amazon cuz it's
09:59 - the easiest one for me to navigate now
10:01 - the issue is you might go to that page
10:03 - and when you click that link the product
10:04 - might be out of stock or I might not be
10:06 - getting any affiliate commission from it
10:08 - or it might be a really high price
10:10 - compared to somewhere else you're just
10:11 - not going to buy it there so what I was
10:14 - thinking is what if I could build some
10:15 - kind of app that could plug into some
10:18 - store that could track the price of the
10:20 - same product on a few different sites
10:22 - that all offer some affiliate commission
10:24 - then what I could do is I could figure
10:25 - out okay what's the price of this
10:27 - product is it in stock and what's the
10:29 - commission that I'm going to get if you
10:30 - were to purchase from that link I then
10:33 - could programmatically and dynamically
10:35 - adjust the product that I'm showing you
10:37 - to make sure first of all there's always
10:38 - one that's in stock so if the Amazon one
10:40 - goes out of stock then I show you the
10:41 - one that's on Walmart instead or
10:44 - alternatively if I wanted to be greedy I
10:45 - could always just show you the one that
10:47 - has the highest commission for me so if
10:49 - if Walmart's offering me 6% and Amazon's
10:52 - only offering me 5% well I'm going to
10:54 - show the Walmart one as opposed to the
10:55 - Amazon one because I don't really care
10:57 - where you buy it from right and then
10:59 - same thing if I wanted to be nice I
11:01 - could always just show you the one that
11:02 - has the lowest price so that you guys
11:04 - are always getting the best deal I think
11:06 - that would be really really cool I think
11:08 - it'd be really complicated to build out
11:10 - because what I need to do is track not
11:12 - only the price inventory level and the
11:15 - commission rate but then I need to
11:17 - dynamically adjust that on the site and
11:19 - I need to make sure this works for
11:20 - really any type of product so I don't
11:22 - know exactly how you would go about
11:23 - building this out my intuition would be
11:25 - okay we need to build a web scraper in
11:27 - fact we're probably going to need to
11:28 - build two for every single product or
11:30 - not every single product every single
11:32 - site we're tracking because I need to
11:34 - build a web scraper for the product but
11:35 - then I need to go and look at what the
11:37 - affiliate commission rate is which is
11:38 - probably from a different site so I need
11:41 - to do that for all the different sites
11:42 - that I'm possibly going to show
11:43 - affiliate links for and then I need to
11:45 - write something that's going to do that
11:47 - automatic update based on whatever
11:49 - preference I would be setting now I'll
11:51 - tell you that when you do try to build
11:52 - these type of web scrapers I guarantee
11:54 - you you will run into issues if you are
11:56 - scaling this up especially if you're
11:58 - triggering them to run run every 10
12:00 - minutes 20 minutes or like a high
12:01 - frequency if that's the case I do highly
12:04 - recommend you check out bright data they
12:06 - have all kinds of tools that really
12:07 - solve all of this for you and they make
12:09 - what seems like a really daunting task
12:12 - actually doable because whatever you do
12:14 - in development you can just push it out
12:15 - to their infrastructure and it's really
12:17 - just handled for you again I have a
12:19 - bunch of videos on my channel where I
12:20 - show you projects using that but I
12:22 - recommend you check it out if you do
12:23 - want to attempt something that's this
12:25 - complicated anyways once I do that I'm
12:28 - now obviously going to need to store all
12:29 - of that in a database I probably want to
12:31 - have the history and track it I need to
12:33 - automatically adjust my site and that's
12:35 - pretty much it so really the front end
12:37 - or the user interface would depend on
12:38 - where I'm showing this I could write
12:39 - something custom for my own site or I
12:41 - could build something like a Shopify app
12:43 - where I could just plug into anyone's
12:45 - store and now I can be the one taking
12:48 - affiliate commissions or I could sell
12:49 - them that as a gassas um or some kind of
12:52 - tool right anyways I think this is a
12:54 - really really cool idea again pretty
12:55 - complicated to build out but maybe it
12:57 - gave you some inspiration or kind of got
12:59 - the wheels spinning which is really the
13:00 - point of these type of videos I hope you
13:02 - got some inspiration from this I hope
13:04 - you're thinking about these
13:05 - opportunities e-commerce really is one
13:07 - of those spaces where you can do quite a
13:09 - lot and you can really drive a lot of
13:11 - value for businesses and even if you
13:13 - don't build something that goes to
13:14 - production these projects look really
13:16 - really good on a resume and they show
13:18 - that you are actually thinking about
13:19 - business needs which a lot of companies
13:21 - aren looking for that kind of
13:23 - well-rounded developer that can code but
13:25 - also understands how their code impacts
13:27 - the bottom line I'll wrap it up here
13:29 - here if you guys enjoyed leave a like
13:31 - subscribe and I will see you in the next
13:33 - one
