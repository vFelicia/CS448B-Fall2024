00:00 - hello everyone and welcome back to the
00:02 - flats tutorial so in this video what I'm
00:04 - we doing is showing you something called
00:06 - template inheritance which is an
00:07 - extremely useful tool so you're not
00:09 - repeating HTML code or JavaScript or
00:12 - whatever it's gonna be throughout your
00:13 - entire website it essentially allows you
00:15 - to create kind of a base template that
00:17 - every other one of your templates will
00:19 - work off of and we'll talk about that
00:21 - I'm also gonna be showing you how we can
00:22 - add bootstrap to our website and just
00:24 - create a basic little navbar I just want
00:26 - to show you guys really you know simply
00:28 - how you can actually make your website
00:29 - look good and then that way you guys can
00:31 - kind of go after this video change some
00:33 - things up and understand how to actually
00:34 - style your website because throughout
00:36 - most of these videos I'm not really
00:37 - gonna be talking about front-end
00:39 - development most of it's gonna be
00:40 - functionality back in talking about user
00:42 - authentication forms all those kind of
00:44 - things and I just want to give you as an
00:46 - idea of how you can actually make decent
00:47 - front-end without having to use some
00:49 - frameworks like react or you know
00:51 - angular stuff like that alright so let's
00:54 - go ahead and get started now I just
00:56 - wanna give you a basic example of what I
00:58 - mean by template inheritance now if we
01:00 - look at you know the bootstrap website
01:02 - which we're gonna be using later in the
01:03 - video we can see here that this website
01:06 - kind of has a theme and we can kind of
01:08 - detect that theme by this navbar up here
01:10 - that you know a specific color it has
01:12 - some things on it and we know that when
01:14 - we click items on the navbar depending
01:16 - what we click obviously we're probably
01:17 - gonna be directed to a page that looks
01:19 - similar with just slightly different
01:21 - content now it wouldn't really make
01:23 - sense for bootstrap or for any of these
01:25 - websites to keep writing the code to
01:27 - generate this navbar on every single web
01:29 - page that they have because this is kind
01:31 - of something that's set it's gonna stay
01:33 - the same for most of the pages and in
01:34 - fact there's probably some more other
01:36 - similar things like maybe you know the
01:37 - footer at the bottom of the website I
01:39 - guess it doesn't have one so I can't
01:40 - show you that they're gonna stay the
01:42 - same so what should we do to you know
01:45 - accomplish not having to repeat this
01:46 - code
01:47 - well flask at least makes this really
01:49 - easy because we can actually inherit
01:51 - templates now what I'm gonna do to
01:53 - illustrate this is just create a new
01:54 - template so I'm just gonna create a new
01:56 - file I'm gonna save this as base dot
01:59 - HTML and this is gonna represent the
02:01 - base template or kind of the base theme
02:03 - of my website it's gonna store all the
02:06 - HTML code that will persist throughout
02:08 - most or the entire website now in here
02:11 - I'm actually just gonna copy all the
02:12 - HTML
02:13 - from index.html and put it directly
02:15 - inside here now I'm going to delete this
02:17 - from index.html we'll start working with
02:20 - a few things here so since this is our
02:22 - base template that means that we are not
02:25 - actually gonna ever render this template
02:27 - we're always just gonna use this as
02:28 - something that you know the child
02:29 - templates which will be for example
02:31 - index.html will inherit from and if
02:34 - you're unfamiliar with inheritance that
02:36 - essentially means you know use
02:37 - everything and then change a few small
02:39 - things are overwrite some functionality
02:41 - of you know the parent which in this
02:43 - case is gonna be the base dot HTML so
02:45 - the way that we can allow our child
02:48 - templates to change specific
02:49 - functionality of the base template is by
02:52 - adding something called blocks now you
02:54 - guys will understand this more as we get
02:55 - through they'll just follow along for
02:57 - now what I'm gonna do is just create
02:59 - something called a block and I'm gonna
03:00 - put it inside the same tags we used
03:02 - before to write you know for loops and
03:03 - if statements inside our HTML code I'm
03:06 - gonna give this block a name by just
03:08 - typing their name directly after block
03:10 - and then what I'm gonna do is simply end
03:12 - the block by typing and block so very
03:15 - similar syntax will be seen before now
03:18 - what this does is essentially say ok
03:20 - we're gonna define a block we're gonna
03:22 - call it content and this block we will
03:25 - allow the child template to give us some
03:27 - content that we will fill in so
03:29 - essentially what I can do now is I can
03:31 - go to this child template I can inherit
03:33 - based on HTML I can create this block
03:36 - and then I can tell you know this block
03:38 - where what content I want and then it
03:40 - will actually substitute it inside here
03:42 - for a title and it will use that title
03:45 - when we render the template so rather
03:47 - than talking about it let's actually do
03:48 - it so to extend a template what we need
03:51 - to do at the very top of our template is
03:53 - type extends not in all capitals like
03:55 - this and then in quotation marks the
03:59 - name of that template so in this case
04:00 - it's gonna be based on HTML it's
04:02 - important that these templates are in
04:03 - the same directory so they can actually
04:05 - see each other if they're not then you'd
04:07 - have to do you know like folder slash
04:09 - based on HTML if that's inside an
04:11 - interior folder okay so we're gonna
04:13 - extend based on HTML and now what I'm
04:15 - gonna do is actually give some content
04:17 - for that block content so this is the
04:19 - exact same as what we had in our base
04:21 - template except this time I'm actually
04:23 - gonna put some stuff in between
04:25 - kind of blocks so I'm gonna say and
04:27 - block like that so block content and
04:29 - block and then inside here I'm actually
04:31 - just gonna put homepage now what this is
04:34 - gonna do is very similar just kind of
04:35 - like an HTML tag where this homepage now
04:38 - will be replaced with whatever this
04:40 - block content is and that will actually
04:41 - show now for us inside title so very
04:44 - useful and you know can definitely save
04:46 - us a lot of time now what I'm gonna do
04:47 - is get rid of this content here and I'm
04:50 - actually just gonna put something that
04:51 - just says you know Tim's website and
04:54 - this h1 tag I'm assuming is gonna be
04:56 - shown on every single page no matter
04:58 - what so we'll leave that there is h1 tag
05:01 - but what I want to do is create another
05:02 - block and I'm gonna call this oops and
05:05 - I'm called this block contents alright
05:07 - I'm gonna call this block title
05:08 - my apologies guys because I actually
05:10 - want to call my next block block content
05:13 - so we'll change the name of that and
05:15 - then what I'm gonna do is define another
05:16 - block I'm gonna call it block content
05:19 - which will represent in our case the
05:21 - content of the website or the content of
05:23 - the web page so I'll do actually I don't
05:25 - know why I copy that and then we'll type
05:27 - end block and now what I've done is to
05:30 - find another block that we can you know
05:31 - overwrite we can put some information
05:33 - into so now from our child template
05:35 - we'll write this block again so we have
05:37 - block content and then we will simply
05:40 - and the block and now in between these
05:44 - two tags I can put any HTML code I want
05:46 - and that will actually be rendered to my
05:49 - base dot HTML template whenever you know
05:51 - we have that popping up so let's do
05:53 - another h1 tag and we'll just say you
05:55 - know tests like that and we'll leave it
05:58 - at that for now okay so let's go back to
06:00 - our actual Python code now this is the
06:03 - exact same that I had in the last video
06:04 - so if you haven't seen that then you can
06:06 - check that out and quick sidenote I will
06:08 - be putting most of this code on my
06:09 - website there will be links in the
06:10 - description to that I'm gonna make one
06:12 - minor change to this because someone did
06:14 - leave a comment and this is definitely
06:16 - gonna be helpful for all of us in this
06:17 - app dot run we can actually define
06:19 - something called debug equals true so
06:23 - just a keyword argument here and what
06:24 - this is actually gonna do is allow us to
06:27 - not have to rerun the server every time
06:29 - we make a change because it will
06:30 - automatically be detecting those changes
06:32 - and updating the website for us so I'm
06:35 - gonna do that and make sure I save that
06:36 - and then what I'm gonna do is run
06:39 - Python tutorial 3 you'll notice we get a
06:41 - few more kind of debug things popping up
06:44 - for us and then what I'm gonna do is
06:46 - just grab this URL we'll go to a new web
06:49 - browser window open that up and there
06:52 - you go we can see we get Tim's website
06:54 - and we get tests so that is kind of
06:56 - exactly what I wanted you know show you
06:59 - guys that's how that works we're
07:01 - extending this base template we're
07:03 - adding our own you know test to that
07:05 - base template by putting out in the blog
07:07 - content and that is pretty much how this
07:09 - works
07:10 - now you might be like well this is kind
07:11 - of you know useless right now because
07:13 - all we're doing is just showing an h1
07:15 - tag rather than doing all this extra
07:16 - work why wouldn't I just you know take
07:18 - this h1 tag and just write to all this
07:20 - HTML and index on HTML well like I was
07:22 - saying before often times we're gonna
07:24 - have some more complex components and
07:26 - I'm actually gonna show you how we can
07:27 - add a nav bar now and then how we can
07:29 - use kind of the base template so all our
07:31 - other templates will have that nav bar
07:32 - on it ok so now that that works let's
07:35 - actually talk about adding bootstrap so
07:37 - if you're unfamiliar with bootstrap
07:39 - essentially what this is is a kind of
07:41 - CSS framework I want to say for quickly
07:45 - kind of creating and styling your
07:47 - website now to add this is actually
07:48 - pretty easy and what I'm gonna do is
07:50 - just grab from the bootstrap website
07:52 - which I'll leave a link to in the
07:53 - description down below I'm gonna look
07:55 - where it says CSS and I'm gonna copy
07:57 - this link right here so there's actually
07:59 - something that says copy so all of this
08:01 - and again this code will be on my
08:02 - website at some point so if you missed
08:04 - that you should be able to grab it I'm
08:05 - gonna take that CSS link I'm gonna paste
08:07 - that inside of my head tags of my
08:10 - website in this case the base HTML
08:12 - template next what I'm gonna do is go to
08:15 - where it says J s here I'm gonna copy
08:17 - all of these scripts and I'm gonna put
08:19 - them at the end of B body so at the very
08:22 - end of the actual base template here now
08:25 - what this is gonna do is allow us to use
08:28 - kind of a library of different classes
08:30 - and I guess like I don't even know what
08:32 - you call them just a bunch of different
08:34 - kind of styling things from bootstrap to
08:36 - make our website website look nicer all
08:39 - right so there we go we have all of that
08:41 - added in and now we actually have
08:43 - bootstrap and in case you're wondering
08:44 - how this works this is on what I think
08:46 - is called a C a CDN which essentially
08:49 - means we don't actually need to download
08:50 - any file
08:51 - because this is just gonna grab the CSS
08:53 - code in the JavaScript code from the
08:55 - internet so that's kind of how that
08:56 - works okay so now that we have all that
08:59 - what I'm actually gonna do is show you
09:00 - how we can just grab you know I kind of
09:02 - a sidebar layout or a navbar layout from
09:05 - this actual website so what I'm gonna do
09:07 - is literally just search navbar on
09:08 - bootstrap here and I'll leave a link to
09:10 - this as well what I'm gonna do is just
09:12 - look for one that I like you know here's
09:13 - the navbar here's a navbar there's a
09:16 - bunch of different nav bars that you can
09:17 - see and this is what I typically do
09:19 - whenever I'm styling a website I just
09:21 - take all this code for an ounce bar copy
09:23 - it and just put it on my website this is
09:25 - a reason they have it here so you can
09:27 - you know modify it change it also just
09:28 - use it so what I'm gonna do is take that
09:31 - code for the navbar copied it and I'm
09:33 - just gonna put it at the top of my body
09:35 - now I will fix this indentation because
09:37 - that kind of frustrates me when it's off
09:39 - but now what I'm gonna do is essentially
09:41 - I've added this to my base template and
09:43 - now this means that any child template
09:45 - will automatically have this nav bar at
09:46 - the top of it and if you don't believe
09:48 - me let me show you so actually let's go
09:51 - here and refresh and now you can see we
09:54 - get this nice navbar popping up at the
09:56 - top of our website we also get Tim's
09:58 - website and we get tests but you know I
10:00 - can delete that h1 tag because we
10:02 - probably don't want that everywhere now
10:04 - if you wanted to change any of the
10:06 - things associate with the navbar
10:07 - obviously all the codes here so you can
10:09 - change them but that's just what I
10:10 - wanted to show you in terms of how we
10:12 - can actually add bootstrap now the
10:14 - reason this navbar is actually working
10:15 - properly is because what we added
10:17 - bootstrap into the website but if for
10:19 - some reason when you add this and it's
10:20 - not working or you know the Styles
10:22 - looking different than this then that
10:24 - probably means you didn't add bootstrap
10:25 - correctly and you need to make sure that
10:27 - you add this link at the top of your
10:30 - head tag so at the very beginning before
10:32 - everything else and that you add these
10:33 - strips for the JavaScript and the Drake
10:35 - query at the end of your body tags so
10:38 - that is kind of all that I want to show
10:40 - you in terms of how to add bootstrap to
10:42 - your website how to make a base template
10:44 - how to make a child template that
10:45 - inherits that base template and just
10:47 - note that you can actually create more
10:50 - child templates than inherit this base
10:51 - template and if I want to show you a
10:53 - really quick example I'll just do you
10:55 - know new dot HTML with a set of another
10:59 - page to show you that this actually does
11:01 - work I'm not even gonna put anything in
11:03 - here
11:04 - this extends based on HTML I don't need
11:07 - to add those blocks if I don't want to
11:09 - and then what I'm gonna do is just
11:10 - create you know a new routes we'll just
11:11 - copy this and we'll just call it slash
11:14 - like test or something like that
11:15 - okay so slash test like that also we can
11:20 - get rid of this content equals testing
11:22 - because obviously index no longer takes
11:24 - that content variable so we don't need
11:25 - that and here I'll just render new HTML
11:29 - whenever we go to that slash test
11:31 - website or slash test page and what is
11:34 - this oh I need to call this a different
11:36 - name my apologies so it's get a mistake
11:37 - there so let's run this now go to slash
11:42 - test and now we can see that we get
11:45 - nothing on our screen except this nav
11:47 - bar and if I go back to the home page
11:49 - you can see that we get tests showing up
11:50 - so that's kind of how that works pretty
11:52 - basic pretty easy that is a way to kind
11:54 - of style your website I'm sure some of
11:56 - you guys know how to use bootstrap you
11:57 - can obviously use you know different
11:58 - kind of frameworks for styling but I
12:00 - personally like bootstrap it's pretty
12:01 - easy and there you are so with that
12:04 - being said if you guys enjoyed the video
12:05 - make sure you leave a like and subscribe
12:07 - and let me know if you want to see any
12:08 - other stuff from this series in the
12:10 - future
