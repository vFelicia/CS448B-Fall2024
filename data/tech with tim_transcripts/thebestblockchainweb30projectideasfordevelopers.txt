00:15 - I'll be sharing with you the best
00:17 - projects that you can work on if you
00:19 - want to become a web 3 or blockchain
00:21 - developer these projects all look great
00:23 - on a resume they will teach you a ton
00:25 - about blockchain development and they're
00:27 - also fun and enjoyable to build I've
00:29 - built almost all of them on this list I
00:31 - really looked forward to going back the
00:32 - next day and kind of adding to the front
00:34 - end and making the contract better and I
00:36 - think you guys will as well now with
00:38 - that said before I get into the first
00:39 - project I will mention that almost all
00:41 - of these projects are included in my new
00:43 - course blockchain expert we just
00:45 - released this course you can check it
00:47 - out from the link in the description
00:48 - it's a great resource to learn
00:50 - blockchain development whether you have
00:51 - experience or not and we walk you
00:53 - through five fully guided projects and
00:56 - two more are coming that use chain link
00:58 - which I think a lot of you will find
00:59 - some value anyways check it out in the
01:01 - link in the description now let me share
01:02 - with you the projects that you can work
01:04 - on to become a better blockchain
01:06 - developer
01:06 - [Music]
01:09 - foreign
01:12 - to project number one now I've kind of
01:15 - put these in order of difficulty so
01:17 - easiest projects first and the most
01:18 - difficult at the end but some of them
01:20 - are kind of hard to rank and it's just a
01:22 - different skill set that you need to
01:23 - have to complete the project so project
01:25 - one is kind of the traditional project
01:27 - that I like to recommend to everyone
01:28 - when you're just starting out and this
01:30 - is a bank account now I know this is a
01:32 - little bit boring people create these
01:34 - all the time you can find all kinds of
01:35 - projects online that do this but it's
01:37 - really critical to understand as you
01:39 - become a blockchain developer how to
01:41 - send and receive ethereum in a safe way
01:44 - to a Smart contract how to maintain user
01:47 - balances and if you wanted to get crazy
01:49 - you could do stuff like having an
01:50 - interest rate on funds that were sent
01:52 - into uh the bank account right so if
01:54 - you're holding funds in the bank account
01:55 - you get a very small interest rate like
01:57 - you would in a normal Bank you could
01:59 - additionally be charging a monthly fee
02:01 - you could have a deposit fee for too
02:03 - small of deposits or lower balances and
02:05 - you can kind of extend this and make it
02:07 - more complicated in a more fun project
02:09 - now whenever you're building projects
02:11 - like these especially anything you're
02:13 - actually going to deploy on a main
02:14 - Network and let people use you want to
02:16 - make sure that not only are you writing
02:18 - a smart contract but you're writing
02:19 - automated tests for it now in my course
02:22 - blockchain expert we teach you how to do
02:23 - this and we test our contracts along the
02:25 - way to make sure they are secure and
02:27 - working properly but I just want to make
02:29 - that clear all of these projects you
02:31 - should have a smart contract as well as
02:33 - automated tests now once you've written
02:35 - a contract that you're confident in and
02:36 - it's working the next thing you're going
02:38 - to want to do is write a deployment
02:40 - script that allows you to automatically
02:41 - deploy this contract to either a test
02:43 - Network which is probably what you're
02:44 - going to do first or to a main Network
02:46 - where you'll have real users and
02:48 - accounts utilizing the contract now once
02:50 - you do that what you want to build is
02:52 - some kind of front end or user interface
02:54 - so users can interact with the contract
02:56 - sure it's great to be able to test it
02:57 - and remix and kind of press some buttons
02:59 - and send some transactions but ideally
03:01 - you want someone who knows nothing about
03:03 - the smart contract to be able to use
03:05 - this like it was a regular just you know
03:07 - non-decentralized application so ideally
03:09 - you go to some web page you connect with
03:11 - metamask and then you can just start
03:13 - depositing withdrawing uh checking your
03:15 - balance Etc like you would on any other
03:17 - kind of bank account so that would be my
03:19 - goal for this first project create a
03:21 - bank account contract test it deploy it
03:23 - write a basic front-end to interact with
03:25 - it and now you've learned how to send
03:27 - and receive ethereum properly and kind
03:29 - of the life cycle of a blockchain
03:31 - application and blockchain development
03:35 - [Music]
03:37 - alright so once you have finished your
03:38 - bank account then the next project I'm
03:40 - going to recommend is creating a
03:42 - decentralized exchange now obviously
03:44 - this is going to be a more basic version
03:45 - the ones like pancake swap or other very
03:48 - popular ones you may have used before
03:49 - but ideally you want to learn here how
03:52 - to interact with erc20 tokens how to get
03:54 - approvals from users to kind of transfer
03:56 - their erc20 tokens and how to receive
03:59 - tokens within a contract so you can
04:01 - create something very basic where say
04:03 - one user submits a custom erc20 token to
04:06 - a decentralized exchange contract then
04:08 - someone can buy that token or tokens at
04:11 - a specified price that would be the most
04:12 - basic version of doing this the next way
04:15 - would be to create something like a
04:16 - liquidity pool now if you were to create
04:18 - a liquidity pool what you would need to
04:20 - do is have an erc20 token which is your
04:22 - LP token your liquidity pool token and
04:25 - you would give that token to users for
04:27 - providing liquidity in your pool now the
04:30 - liquidity aspect of the pool is
04:31 - different erc20 tokens or ether or
04:34 - whatever it is that you're providing as
04:35 - an asset now that LP token should be
04:38 - gaining interest which means that when
04:40 - you go to redeem your LP token later on
04:42 - you're going to be get paid whatever you
04:44 - deposited plus the interest amount now
04:46 - to do this you would have to learn more
04:48 - about decentralized exchanges and
04:49 - exactly how this works but this is a
04:51 - really great project it's not overly
04:53 - complicated if you do kind of a
04:55 - simplistic version of a liquidity pool
04:57 - and you can learn again how to exchange
04:58 - and transfer tokens how to actually do
05:01 - like a trade if someone wants to trade
05:02 - their ether for a specific token or a
05:04 - token for ether Etc
05:06 - [Music]
05:09 - alright so once you have learned about
05:11 - erc20 tokens and implemented some kind
05:14 - of decentralized exchange what I would
05:16 - work on is creating an nft auction now
05:19 - the reason you want to do something like
05:20 - this is not just because nfts are great
05:22 - and everyone should go sell pieces of
05:23 - art but it's because you want to learn
05:25 - about ERC 721 tokens and specifically
05:27 - ipfs which is your interplanetary file
05:30 - system now in blockchain expert I tell
05:32 - you all about this I show you how to use
05:34 - ipfs and how to Mint new tokens check it
05:36 - out in the description but this is
05:38 - something a lot of people are not
05:39 - familiar with and don't actually
05:41 - understand how to interact with so when
05:43 - you're creating an nft auction obviously
05:45 - Step One is create some kind of nft this
05:47 - is actually fairly simple but what gets
05:49 - a little more complicated is when you
05:51 - have to store data on ipfs you have to
05:53 - kind of learn about how ipfs Works how
05:55 - you store data there in a decentralized
05:57 - manner and then how you retrieve that
05:59 - data later on when you're trying to
06:01 - display an nft the nft attributes the
06:03 - image associated with an nft
06:06 - Etc now once you've created an nft
06:07 - contract and you've tested that nft
06:09 - contract the next thing you need to do
06:11 - is make an auction contract and this
06:13 - contract should be able to auction any
06:14 - nft just like something like open C does
06:17 - right so by doing this you're going to
06:19 - learn about how to actually accept nfts
06:21 - or ERC 721 tokens into a smart contract
06:24 - how to have a timed auction how to have
06:27 - different bid amounts how to select who
06:28 - won the auction how to transfer that nft
06:31 - back to them and then of course you're
06:32 - gonna have to create some kind of front
06:33 - end that shows you the auction going on
06:35 - so you're going to want to log the
06:37 - different events when people are bidding
06:39 - you're going to want to update users
06:40 - that they've been L bid you're going to
06:42 - want to have the actual nft image on the
06:44 - website you want to show the statistics
06:46 - of the nft and then you're going to want
06:47 - to show expired auctions history sale
06:50 - prices all of that kind of stuff so you
06:52 - can go crazy with this auction project
06:54 - or you can create a more basic version
06:56 - this is a really good one to work on and
06:58 - personally when I created this project I
07:00 - found it quite interesting to learn
07:02 - about ipfs learn more about nfts and get
07:05 - some insight into how popular kind of
07:07 - platforms like openc actually operate
07:13 - all right so once you've created your
07:15 - nft auction the next project I would
07:17 - work on is a decentralized voting
07:19 - protocol now this is where you're going
07:21 - to take your knowledge of ipfs and
07:23 - implement it into a decentralized
07:25 - protocol or kind of a decentralized
07:27 - organization almost where users are able
07:29 - to vote on different polls or vote for
07:31 - things to happen within you know a dow
07:34 - or within some kind of org or whatever
07:36 - you want to call it so what I did for
07:37 - this specific project is I made it so
07:39 - that users kind of had to be a part of a
07:41 - group or an organization they either had
07:43 - to pay to get in that group or be
07:44 - whitelisted to be like a part of the
07:46 - group and then if they were in the group
07:48 - they could create a poll and that poll
07:50 - would have you know whatever you're
07:51 - voting on so like a description and then
07:53 - a bunch of options that people could
07:55 - vote on now this data since it was so
07:57 - large and maybe there was an image
07:58 - associated with it I needed to store on
08:00 - ipfs so I need to store the description
08:02 - of the poll and then all of the
08:04 - individual options so I did that and
08:06 - then I had users be able to vote on all
08:08 - of the different options so this meant I
08:10 - had to grab my ipfs data display this on
08:13 - a front end and then allow users that
08:15 - haven't already voted for this to well
08:16 - vote on a poll I had an expiry date on
08:18 - the poll and this was a way of again
08:20 - creating some decentralized voting and
08:22 - kind of like a democratic system in a
08:24 - sense so again I'm kind of
08:26 - oversimplifying it here but I would
08:28 - create something along those lines where
08:29 - you have an organization of people who
08:31 - can vote on different topics or vote on
08:33 - different polls and maybe those polls
08:35 - affect some kind of cryptocurrency or
08:36 - they affect a token or they change some
08:39 - property of a smart contract you can do
08:41 - kind of whatever you want with that or
08:43 - maybe you just have a boat and you can
08:44 - just kind of track the vote in a
08:46 - decentralized manner that is what I
08:47 - would do here if you want to learn more
08:49 - about that of course check out
08:50 - blockchain expert
08:53 - all right so once you have created those
08:56 - kind of projects the next projects I
08:57 - would work on would be a bit larger and
08:59 - more complicated but really show you
09:01 - what's possible to do with the
09:03 - blockchain so obviously what I just
09:04 - showed you is great those are awesome
09:05 - projects but what I would work on after
09:08 - this are larger projects related to
09:10 - chain link and using oracles or related
09:13 - to kind of layer 2 Solutions and games
09:16 - on the blockchain which are more
09:17 - complicated to implement so starting
09:19 - with the chain link projects first of
09:21 - all chain link provides a Oracle Network
09:23 - now what an oracle is is a way of taking
09:26 - off-chain data say like the result in a
09:28 - World Cup game and bringing that on
09:30 - change that you can then verify that in
09:32 - a smart contract and do something based
09:34 - on that result so if you wanted to
09:35 - create a decentralized gambling platform
09:37 - or betting platform you would need
09:39 - off-chain data like the result in a
09:41 - hockey game or the result in a baseball
09:42 - game or whatever it is so that you can
09:44 - actually determine who won a specific
09:46 - bet so this you would use chain link to
09:48 - do I can't really explain it much more
09:50 - than this in the short video you could
09:51 - of course check out blockchain expert
09:53 - wherever about to have a chain link
09:54 - project that does something similar to
09:56 - that but this is a really cool thing and
09:58 - shows you again how to take that
09:59 - off-chain data Bring It On chain and
10:01 - utilize that in a decentralized manner
10:06 - alright so once you have created your
10:08 - sports betting or gambling app or
10:10 - whatever it is that you want to create I
10:12 - probably shouldn't be promoting that but
10:13 - you know what I mean right take off
10:14 - chain data do something with it on the
10:16 - blockchain just the best example is some
10:18 - kind of gambling stuff after you've done
10:19 - that what I would do is work on some
10:21 - kind of gate now the game that I would
10:23 - choose is something like poker or
10:25 - Blackjack the gambling games just make a
10:28 - lot of sense on the blockchain because
10:29 - you're actually dealing with money and
10:30 - sending money but you could even do
10:31 - something like rock paper scissors right
10:33 - you can do something whatever type of
10:34 - game you want do it on the blockchain
10:36 - however since the blockchain is fairly
10:38 - slow and transactions take a very long
10:40 - time this kind of does not allow you to
10:42 - have a synchronous game you have to have
10:44 - an asynchronous game where people are
10:45 - constantly clicking buttons and it's a
10:47 - really bad user experience so instead of
10:50 - doing that I would use a layer 2
10:52 - solution like Roll-Ups now roll ups
10:55 - allow you to bundle a lot of
10:56 - transactions on layer two and then take
10:59 - them into essentially one bundle and
11:00 - submit them to layer one for validation
11:02 - and verification so this lets you have
11:04 - kind of a live game where you're are
11:07 - having all kinds of micro transactions
11:08 - occurring all of those transactions get
11:10 - bundled then submitted to layer 1 and
11:13 - that allows you to do things very fast
11:14 - and actually have like a live game going
11:17 - on like you would do in a traditional
11:19 - kind of centralized manner with a
11:20 - central server now I actually have a
11:22 - video that goes more in depth about how
11:24 - Roll-Ups work in other layer 2 solutions
11:26 - to allow you to do this very fast
11:28 - transaction processing so I'll throw
11:30 - that on the screen and put it in the
11:31 - description but I would consider getting
11:33 - into this kind of stuff because that's
11:35 - really what the future of the blockchain
11:36 - and web3 is going to look like trying to
11:38 - replicate what we currently have in a
11:40 - centralized fashion decentralized and
11:42 - with the previous projects you can't
11:44 - really have any live updating stuff just
11:46 - because of the delay and latency with
11:48 - the blockchain when you use a layer 2
11:50 - solution you can have very fast and live
11:52 - updating data that allows you to create
11:54 - some very cool and flexible games if you
11:57 - want to learn more about blockchain
11:58 - development and become a blockchain
12:00 - engineer then check out blockchain
12:01 - expert from the link in the description
12:03 - it really is the best resource on the
12:05 - internet to become a web and blockchain
12:07 - developer we have spent a ton of time
12:09 - working on it and has a massive amount
12:11 - of content and after you go through that
12:13 - I guarantee you'll be confident to
12:14 - create smart contracts and have some
12:16 - real practical projects under your belt
12:18 - with that said let me end it here I hope
12:20 - you enjoyed and I look forward to seeing
12:21 - you in another YouTube video
12:24 - [Music]
