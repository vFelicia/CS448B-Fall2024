00:00 - so I need to start this video by giving
00:02 - a massive thank you to all of you guys
00:04 - to everyone who watches my videos who
00:06 - likes them who comments and especially
00:08 - to everyone that subscribed to the
00:10 - channel this has been a milestone that
00:12 - I've been working to reach for so long
00:13 - and I finally got here after so much
00:16 - hard work and I just owe you guys so
00:18 - much for helping me and you know all the
00:20 - support that you guys give me it's
00:21 - overwhelming and really is what keeps me
00:24 - going and what's gotten me to this point
00:26 - now what I'm gonna be doing in this
00:27 - video is kind of sharing with you my
00:29 - journey getting to 50,000 subscribers so
00:33 - the amount of work I had to put in which
00:34 - is a ton and you guys gonna see that
00:36 - throughout this video as well as just
00:38 - some of the things I learned and maybe
00:40 - some mistakes I made so that you guys
00:42 - can learn for them as well there's so
00:44 - much that I've changed and learned and
00:46 - kind of done differently as I've grown
00:48 - throughout this youtube channel and
00:50 - that's what I'm sharing with you guys in
00:51 - this video now before I go too far I
00:54 - have a really exciting announcement that
00:56 - I want to tell you guys about and that
00:57 - is that I'm officially releasing my
00:59 - first ever premium programming course
01:02 - now I know a lot of you guys are gonna
01:04 - be kind of concerned about this because
01:06 - you're thinking it's just a money grab
01:07 - or I'm not gonna be posting more videos
01:09 - on YouTube but that is definitely not
01:11 - the case and this does not affect that
01:12 - whatsoever this course is something I've
01:15 - been working on just kind of in in my
01:17 - spare time having it like low priority
01:19 - and now it's finally done and ready to
01:21 - share with you guys and it is called the
01:23 - fundamentals of programming with Python
01:26 - now right now this course is 35% off
01:29 - it's gonna be like that for the next
01:30 - week just to celebrate hitting 50000
01:33 - subscribers as well as my birthday on
01:35 - July 20th but after that there's gonna
01:37 - be no more discount so definitely go and
01:39 - roll if you are interested in learning
01:41 - that now quick kind of summary of what
01:43 - the course is essentially I've noticed
01:45 - that a lot of programmers and people
01:47 - that are trying to get into the space
01:48 - lack a fundamental knowledge of
01:51 - programming concepts and just some very
01:53 - basic like algorithms and syntax and
01:56 - things that apply to all different
01:57 - languages so what I've done with this
01:59 - course is try to build it around giving
02:01 - a really good foundation to the beginner
02:04 - level programmer that will allow them to
02:06 - learn more and work towards better goals
02:09 - in the future because a huge thing
02:11 - that's gonna
02:11 - you back is a lack of fundamental skills
02:13 - and that's probably the number one issue
02:15 - I see with anyone that asks me for help
02:17 - that people that I'm tutoring with
02:19 - students with kids is that they lack the
02:21 - fundamental knowledge and that's what
02:22 - this course is meant to teach you
02:24 - anyways because interested in that
02:26 - please go and roll down below there's a
02:28 - link in the description and it's gonna
02:29 - be 35% off before the next week now with
02:32 - that being said sorry for the long intro
02:34 - but let's get into the video all right
02:37 - so in this part of the video I want to
02:39 - talk to you guys about some specific
02:40 - strategies I've used to grow my YouTube
02:43 - channel as well as just a lot of things
02:45 - that I've learned kind of throughout
02:46 - this journey so a lot of you don't
02:48 - actually know when I started this
02:49 - YouTube channel it was about
02:51 - two-and-a-half years ago and it was
02:52 - something I did not take seriously
02:53 - whatsoever I would kind of just randomly
02:56 - post videos whenever I felt like it
02:57 - there was no structure of those videos
02:59 - maybe I'd started playlist and I just
03:01 - ended halfway through and it was kind of
03:03 - just not great I obviously was not
03:06 - following any of the best practices and
03:08 - for me was just something I kind of did
03:10 - when I was bored and I never really saw
03:12 - any future in it or any I didn't have
03:14 - any intention to kind of continue it and
03:15 - grow it to what I'm at today now what
03:18 - kind of led me into starting to actually
03:19 - take it seriously was all of the
03:21 - positive feedback I got on some of my
03:24 - videos so even though I kind of posted
03:26 - randomly it was probably on a point
03:28 - where I had to put 70 videos uploaded
03:30 - kind of from some different niches like
03:33 - talking about cryptocurrency as well as
03:35 - programming and some hardware stuff as
03:37 - well and I started getting a lot of
03:38 - positive feedback from the few people
03:41 - that were watching my videos and that's
03:42 - what really drove me to continue
03:44 - creating YouTube videos was the fact
03:47 - that even though there was only a few
03:48 - some people out there that seen my stuff
03:50 - really liked it and we're telling me you
03:52 - know continue continue you're doing a
03:54 - good job and that's what really pushed
03:55 - me forward so when I tell you guys that
03:57 - I read every comment and that I really
03:59 - do appreciate the positive feedback I
04:01 - mean that because without you guys I
04:03 - would wouldn't even have any of the
04:05 - videos that I have today and that's
04:06 - really what made me want to continue so
04:09 - anyways as I started posting more videos
04:11 - I kind of started getting into routines
04:14 - it start figuring out what I needed to
04:16 - do to make a better youtube video or
04:18 - just actually get one out there because
04:20 - for me being a full time student time is
04:22 - something that I don't
04:23 - a lot of so what I started doing when I
04:25 - went to university was allocating my
04:27 - time around creating YouTube videos
04:29 - something that I hadn't done before
04:31 - which was kind of like I was just
04:33 - randomly posting whenever I felt like it
04:35 - or when I had spare time I wasn't making
04:37 - time to create YouTube videos which is
04:39 - what I started doing which led me to see
04:42 - a significant growth in my channel I'm
04:43 - gonna talk specifically about that so in
04:46 - school I started realizing really
04:48 - quickly in university how much free time
04:49 - I had and up until then I had been
04:52 - spending my free time kind of watching
04:54 - YouTube videos or playing video games or
04:56 - just doing unproductive stuff that I
04:58 - wasn't super happy with so I started
05:01 - kind of analyzing my time and figuring
05:02 - out you know what am I wasting time and
05:04 - what could I be doing better with that
05:06 - time and for me my answer was well I
05:09 - have this YouTube channel I haven't
05:10 - really been doing it as much as I should
05:11 - or as much as I could have let's put
05:14 - some more time into that and the more
05:16 - and more time that I put into the
05:17 - YouTube channel the more I wanted to
05:19 - continue doing it it was something I
05:20 - actually really enjoyed doing posting
05:22 - videos chatting with you guys and I
05:25 - started seeing more and more results the
05:26 - more that I cared about my videos and
05:28 - the more videos that I made and as I did
05:31 - this I kind of built a little bit of an
05:33 - upload schedule for myself to try and
05:36 - post a video every other day that was my
05:38 - goal and that was something that I
05:39 - accomplished fairly easily in university
05:42 - so then what I decided to do was push
05:44 - myself to do a video every day and this
05:46 - is when I started seeing massive growth
05:48 - in my channel from viewers engagement
05:51 - subscribers everything something that I
05:53 - learned really quickly is that YouTube
05:55 - rewards consistency and that if you
05:57 - consistently upload a user's more likely
05:59 - to want to subscribe to your channel so
06:01 - as I did that I started seeing growth
06:03 - now with this growth my confidence built
06:05 - in this YouTube channel I started
06:07 - gaining some more traction maybe it made
06:09 - a little bit more money and I was just
06:11 - more and more motivated to keep working
06:13 - on it
06:13 - so I started again just spending all
06:15 - that free time that I had before that I
06:18 - was just wasting essentially playing
06:19 - video games or watching youtube videos
06:21 - to actually creating more content into
06:23 - engaging with my audience and that's
06:25 - what brings me into the next point which
06:27 - was something that was really important
06:28 - that I did to continue to grow and that
06:31 - was answering every single comment now
06:33 - I'm kind of the point today where it's
06:35 - very difficult to do that
06:37 - because I get so many comments on my
06:39 - videos but back then what I would do is
06:41 - I'd make an effort to every like hour or
06:43 - so read through my comments and answer
06:45 - as many of them as I could as long as
06:47 - they were reasonable and I actually had
06:49 - an answer to those comments and I
06:51 - started realizing when I was doing this
06:53 - people really appreciated that and some
06:55 - people were really surprised that I
06:56 - actually answered them and I kind of
06:58 - thought in my head you know if I do this
07:00 - not only does it look good on the
07:03 - channel when someone comes on and sees
07:04 - that I've answered people but those
07:06 - people that I'm responding to are
07:07 - getting a ton of value from what I'm
07:09 - telling them whether I'm answering
07:11 - question or just saying thank you or
07:12 - whatever it is and they remember that
07:14 - and I was something really important
07:16 - that I started doing was actually
07:18 - engaging with my community which I
07:20 - hadn't done at all in the past and even
07:22 - though it's hard to kind of quantify how
07:24 - well that affects your channel I think
07:26 - that that's something that's definitely
07:27 - helped me I mean you guys can let me
07:28 - know in the comments down below about
07:30 - that as well
07:31 - now another thing I started doing was
07:34 - focusing on the quality of my videos and
07:36 - I started getting new equipment and just
07:39 - really kind of doubling down and
07:41 - reinvesting any and a little bits of
07:42 - money I've made into creating better
07:44 - videos because not only does that show
07:46 - the audience that you know I care about
07:48 - the quality of video but it also just
07:50 - kind of brings the channel up and just
07:53 - keeps constantly improving and today
07:54 - that's what I aim to do I recently
07:56 - bought these new lights that I don't
07:58 - know if you guys can tell her out right
07:59 - here I have this new camera I got a new
08:01 - microphone I'm getting new computer
08:03 - parts just any bit of money that I do
08:05 - make from this channel I'm constantly
08:06 - reinvesting because I want to create the
08:08 - best video as possible and I think if
08:11 - that's something that you're not doing
08:12 - when you're creating a YouTube channel
08:13 - that you're making a massive mistake so
08:16 - anyways that's kind of some of the more
08:17 - specific tips that I have for you know
08:20 - building YouTube channel are things that
08:22 - I've learned as I went on but I'm gonna
08:23 - talk about now the most important thing
08:25 - that I put into this channel which is
08:27 - just a lot of hard work and dedication
08:30 - in university I got up almost every
08:33 - morning at 5:30 a.m. to work on this
08:35 - channel and to make videos and to create
08:37 - what website articles to you know work
08:40 - with other people to answer emails
08:42 - whatever it is I put the work in and the
08:45 - more and more work I put in not only did
08:47 - the better I feel a
08:49 - the YouTube videos and just everything
08:51 - that I have but the more and more
08:53 - results I saw and something I realized
08:55 - really quickly was the more work you put
08:57 - in the bigger results you're gonna see
08:59 - now I know it seems like really trivial
09:01 - and that everybody already knows that
09:02 - but there were always a part of me that
09:04 - thought for some reason that there's a
09:06 - way to skip the hard work or that there
09:08 - was some tips you can learn or some
09:10 - tricks or tools that would kind of
09:12 - accelerate you and you didn't need as
09:13 - much hard work because everybody thought
09:15 - that's just kind of the way that I
09:16 - thought about it previously in the last
09:18 - year or so but recently I realized that
09:20 - there's no way around that and that at
09:22 - the end of the day the person that works
09:24 - the hardest is gonna get the results and
09:26 - that's something that I definitely see
09:28 - with this channel considering the amount
09:29 - of hours I put in every single day to
09:32 - doing this so today what I do to
09:34 - continue to grow my YouTube channel and
09:36 - just to continue to you know talk with
09:39 - you guys and work with brands and all
09:42 - this stuff is I'm always constantly
09:44 - working on it whether I'm at work which
09:46 - I probably shouldn't be sometimes I'm
09:48 - always checking my email I'm always
09:49 - checking my comments I'm checking stats
09:51 - I'm thinking about new video ideas and
09:53 - immediately when I get home and I have
09:55 - free time the first thing I'm doing is
09:57 - creating video like what I'm doing right
09:59 - now and making sure that I get some
10:01 - content out there to you guys I've
10:02 - recently also started a Twitter and
10:04 - Instagram at discord server just more
10:06 - and more ways to kind of engage the
10:08 - community and that's one of the most
10:09 - important things for me now is to make
10:11 - sure that I engage with you guys outside
10:13 - of just those YouTube videos that I post
10:15 - online so anyways that is kind of a
10:18 - little bit about how I've grown my
10:19 - channel I know this wasn't super
10:21 - specific or go into extreme details but
10:23 - really if you get anything from this
10:25 - video just putting in hard work really
10:27 - does matter and it really does get you
10:29 - the results that you want and I worked
10:31 - for so worked so hard for so long with
10:34 - no results and I just kept grinding and
10:37 - grinding and grinding and going and
10:38 - going and going and now finally those
10:40 - results are coming in and that's
10:42 - something that I think so many people
10:43 - don't have is the willpower to keep
10:46 - going when no one knows who you are when
10:47 - no one watches your stuff and you just
10:49 - keep riding and grinding and grinding
10:50 - because they don't see immediately and
10:53 - that's something that I would say to
10:54 - anyone that wants to create you know a
10:56 - business or YouTube channel or whatever
10:58 - it is that you have to put in so much
11:00 - work that's not getting rewarded before
11:02 - event
11:03 - you know you get to that successful
11:05 - point and no one really looks at that
11:07 - when they think about you know
11:08 - successful businessman or successful
11:10 - youtubers they don't think about that
11:11 - many hours they spent alone in their
11:13 - basement creating videos or not going
11:16 - out with their friends on the weekend to
11:18 - put in the hard work they just think
11:19 - about what they're at now and I think I
11:21 - have a really good appreciation now for
11:23 - the amount work it really takes to you
11:25 - know get to a level like I'm at right
11:27 - now and I'm not trying to speak like
11:29 - this is massive and like I'm this big
11:31 - shot now or whatever it's just something
11:32 - that is really rewarding to me because I
11:35 - know how much work I put into this and
11:36 - to get finally to 50,000 subscribers
11:39 - which is something I've wanted to do for
11:41 - a long time just feels really good and I
11:43 - have an appreciation now for you know
11:45 - all the hard work it takes to do
11:46 - something like this so anyways I hope
11:48 - this video could have maybe motivate you
11:50 - a little bit or just helped you
11:51 - understand what it is I actually do and
11:54 - the amount of work I put into this as
11:56 - well as creating videos and also writing
11:57 - website articles I'm answering emails I
12:00 - have all these other things going on
12:01 - that you guys don't get to see I just
12:03 - want you to kind of get an idea of you
12:04 - know how much work really goes in and
12:07 - it's not as easy as just you know
12:08 - creating a ten minute video once a week
12:10 - right so with that being said I'm gonna
12:13 - wrap up the video here definitely go and
12:15 - roll in my course if you guys are still
12:17 - around here and you want to learn the
12:19 - fundamentals of programming with Python
12:21 - it is 35% off for the next seven days
12:23 - and after that is not gonna be
12:25 - discounted anymore other than special
12:26 - occasions so with that being said I will
12:28 - see you guys in another video and hope
12:31 - you enjoy
