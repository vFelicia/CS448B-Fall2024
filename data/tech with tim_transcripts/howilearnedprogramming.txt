00:00 - hey guys and welcome back so in today's
00:02 - video I'm gonna bring you through my
00:04 - journey learning to program over the
00:06 - past six years so for those of you that
00:08 - don't know I started programming when I
00:10 - was 12 years old and I'm now 18 close to
00:13 - turning 19 and I'm a computer science
00:15 - major so I consider almost everything I
00:17 - know because I'm self-taught and I go
00:19 - online and I look stuff up and I do
00:21 - research and all that and I'm just gonna
00:23 - walk you through why I got into
00:24 - programming how I got into it and how I
00:27 - kind of reached the level that I'm at
00:28 - today so as a kid I was always one of
00:31 - those kids who did very well in school
00:33 - but had to put very minimal effort in
00:35 - and I'm sure you guys know those kids or
00:37 - are those kids yourself now this was
00:40 - great in elementary school because it
00:42 - meant I never had to do homework I
00:43 - didn't have to study I never had to
00:44 - worry about doing poorly on a test but
00:46 - at the same time I never felt challenged
00:49 - in this led to me just being bored in
00:51 - class and just really you know not
00:53 - having much to do to be honest so as a
00:55 - kid what I would do is I was always
00:58 - interested in how things worked and why
01:00 - they worked so one day I think I went
01:02 - online and I just searched how did a
01:03 - computer work and watch through a few
01:06 - videos and kind of was like wow this is
01:07 - really interesting and through
01:09 - researching this and looking this kind
01:11 - of stuff up I eventually came to
01:13 - programming now programming to me was
01:16 - something completely new I'd never heard
01:18 - of it my teachers never talked about it
01:19 - my parents didn't do it it was just
01:21 - completely new to me so I started
01:23 - learning HTML and CSS I think I went on
01:26 - some New Boston tutorial online that was
01:28 - the first language that came up so I was
01:30 - like alright let's learn this now after
01:32 - doing it for probably an hour too I
01:33 - became immediately addicted this was the
01:36 - first time for me that I felt slightly
01:38 - challenged and it was just an amazing
01:41 - feeling for me because I was actually
01:43 - having to think and think logically and
01:45 - just do awesome things on my computer so
01:49 - I started learning it almost every night
01:51 - I would come home from school watch one
01:53 - or two new Boston videos program along
01:55 - on the side try to tweak with some
01:56 - things mess with them things and I just
01:58 - absolutely loved it so over the course
01:59 - of a year or two I got really good at
02:01 - learning HTML CSS JavaScript and PHP and
02:05 - by the time I eventually reached that
02:07 - JavaScript level and I was doing some
02:09 - dynamic stuff with my HTML
02:11 - I really loved JavaScript and I was like
02:14 - I'm not a creative person I'm not very
02:16 - artistic I don't really like the design
02:18 - aspect of web development but this
02:20 - JavaScript stuff the backend you don't
02:23 - really see but does everything that is
02:25 - what really interests me so I started
02:27 - looking up stuff that was similar to
02:29 - JavaScript and figuring out more things
02:31 - I could do with it now back then
02:33 - javascript was not nearly as used as it
02:35 - was today I don't think they had no js'
02:38 - or maybe they did all that stuff anyways
02:40 - I didn't know about it so I didn't
02:41 - realize you could create like crazy
02:42 - stuff with JavaScript so I actually
02:44 - ended up going and learning c-sharp now
02:47 - this was off a recommendation from one
02:49 - of my dad's co-workers or colleagues or
02:51 - friends or someone he knew he said
02:53 - c-sharp oh that's a great language you
02:54 - should learn that don't know if I
02:56 - completely agree with him on that one
02:57 - but anyways I started learning c-sharp
03:00 - and this was my first real programming
03:02 - language and this was where I just
03:04 - became immersed in different programming
03:06 - concepts and actually started developing
03:08 - computer science skills and getting good
03:10 - at real programming because in my
03:12 - opinion HTML and CSS it's a good
03:14 - starting point but it doesn't teach you
03:16 - kind of that logical foundation that you
03:18 - need to be well a programmer so I
03:21 - started looking at c-sharp I did this
03:23 - again every night after school it was
03:25 - something I was super addicted to and I
03:27 - would create these little applications
03:28 - I remember creating some applications
03:30 - that would solve like my equations in
03:32 - math just doing some really interesting
03:33 - stuff and I think I got to the point
03:36 - where I was at like objects and classes
03:38 - in C sharp so I understood kind of
03:40 - functions and some of that different
03:42 - stuff but I was not really at an
03:44 - advanced level and keep in mind this is
03:45 - when I'm like 14 years old so now I'm
03:48 - going into grade 9 and I figure out that
03:51 - there's this programming class or a
03:53 - course or after-school thing at my
03:55 - school so I'm like okay I'm gonna join
03:57 - that and see what it's like so I go to a
03:59 - few meetings and I quickly realize that
04:01 - what this is is it's actually
04:02 - competition for the University of
04:04 - Waterloo programming competition it's
04:07 - called Canadian computing competition
04:09 - and it's a set of questions and you get
04:11 - graded based on how many things you get
04:12 - right so I asked the guy who's running
04:14 - and I'm like so what language can I
04:16 - write this in can I write it in c-sharp
04:17 - because that was the one that I knew
04:19 - really well and that I had been
04:21 - programming in for like the past year
04:22 - and he's like no unfortunately they
04:24 - don't support the
04:25 - that languages but if you want to learn
04:28 - one and you want to do this you should
04:29 - learn Python and this is what started my
04:32 - Python career and almost kind of this
04:34 - YouTube channel as well
04:36 - so picking up Python any of you that
04:39 - have gone from like a language like Java
04:40 - or C sharp to Python know that Python
04:42 - has so many amazing things that would
04:45 - take you like 10 or 20 lines to do in
04:47 - c-sharp like functions that just do it
04:49 - for you so I immediately fell in love
04:51 - with Python and I started learning it
04:52 - and learning it but by the time that
04:54 - competition came I didn't feel confident
04:57 - enough to do it looking back I probably
04:59 - should have just done it and just see
05:01 - how well I did but I didn't know Python
05:02 - that well I still had to look up some of
05:04 - the syntax and I was like you know what
05:06 - I'm not gonna do the computation so I
05:08 - skipped out on the competition but I
05:09 - continue to learn Python and use Python
05:12 - on a daily basis as well as kind of
05:14 - doing a bit of c-sharp as in the back
05:17 - so then grade 10 comes along and I
05:20 - enroll in a actual programming course in
05:23 - high school now this course taught
05:25 - ActionScript now ActionScript I don't
05:27 - know if any of you guys know it it's the
05:28 - language used with flash so you can
05:30 - actually do like animations that you
05:32 - draw the animations and create objects
05:34 - then you can move them with ActionScript
05:36 - no one uses ActionScript completely use
05:38 - this language but that's what we were
05:40 - learning programming it so this was
05:41 - super simple for me I completed every
05:44 - assignment in like half an hour because
05:46 - I already had the fundamentals of
05:48 - programming down I new variable as I
05:49 - knew loops I knew about all this stuff
05:51 - worked so I was way ahead in the class
05:53 - so what I ended up doing in that class
05:55 - was just working more on Python and
05:57 - working more on my own stuff now after
06:00 - ActionScript and after completing that
06:02 - course I'd still been doing Python
06:04 - consistently after school and learning
06:05 - it and learning it and getting better
06:07 - and this is when I started my youtube
06:09 - channel I was like okay you know I see
06:12 - these people on YouTube like the new
06:13 - Boston and centex and all these amazing
06:16 - guys that I look up to and some of them
06:17 - that I even get to talk to you today and
06:19 - I'm like this is awesome
06:21 - I want to do something similar to this
06:22 - so I started teaching Python the very
06:26 - basics on my youtube channel this was
06:28 - completely no schedule I had no plans to
06:30 - actually do this full-time it was just
06:32 - like you know what I'm gonna do some
06:34 - videos on Python and maybe it'll help
06:35 - out a few people I like teaching this
06:37 - it's kind of cool so I'm like alright
06:39 - let
06:40 - do it so I start doing these videos on
06:42 - YouTube with Python not really going
06:44 - anywhere not really doing anything I
06:45 - forget about the YouTube channel I just
06:47 - keep working on Python and getting
06:48 - better and better and better and
06:50 - learning making different projects and
06:52 - programs and all of that stuff now grade
06:55 - 11 comes up comes along and now we're in
06:57 - a real programming course and this is
06:59 - using Python so you guys can imagine
07:01 - that what ended up happening here was I
07:04 - knew everything that we were learning in
07:07 - this course so same thing as the last
07:09 - course with ActionScript everything was
07:12 - just super simple super easy and what
07:14 - ended up happening was I would sit
07:16 - beside some of my friends in that class
07:17 - and I would actually start teaching them
07:19 - Python because the teacher that we had
07:21 - he was doing as good as a job as he
07:22 - could have but for a lot of kids they
07:24 - were having trouble understanding the
07:25 - concepts and since I I already knew it
07:27 - and I was one of their peers they were
07:29 - not hesitant to come up and ask me
07:30 - questions so as I started doing this I
07:33 - would finish my assignment in like 10 15
07:35 - minutes and then help out my friends and
07:36 - teach them Python and programming they
07:38 - started saying to me like hey man like
07:40 - you're doing a really good job teaching
07:42 - me like what he just said makes no sense
07:43 - but you just made it super clear and now
07:46 - I understand it and I never had any kind
07:48 - of intention of being a teacher or doing
07:50 - any of this stuff but apparently the way
07:52 - that I explain things and was I don't
07:55 - know teaching people stuff worked really
07:56 - well so this is what I started doing
07:59 - more and more of and people would just
08:00 - know if they need anything in class you
08:02 - go to Tim you ask him he'll help you out
08:04 - so I figured you know what I had done
08:06 - these few videos on YouTube I was
08:08 - getting a few positive comments on them
08:09 - I had like maybe 100 subscribers
08:11 - something like that so I started doing
08:13 - some more and I was like if people my
08:15 - class can benefit from my teaching then
08:16 - maybe people online can as well so I
08:19 - kept doing it kept doing it and I took a
08:22 - few breaks I wasn't really going
08:23 - anywhere and then I got better and it
08:25 - just was like on and off YouTube until
08:27 - eventually I created this one video that
08:29 - did really well and this was my PI game
08:31 - programming series so I did this PI game
08:34 - series I didn't even do the rest of the
08:36 - videos I just did the first video and
08:38 - you guys have probably seen this video
08:39 - that might even be why you're subscribed
08:40 - to my channel and as I kept doing these
08:43 - PI game videos I was getting more and
08:44 - more subscribers and I was getting all
08:46 - these positive comments and people
08:47 - practically begging me to keep teaching
08:49 - them online so I was like you know what
08:51 - maybe this is something I wanted to do
08:53 - and I did more and more videos like once
08:55 - a week and just continually kept doing
08:57 - more and more and getting better and
08:58 - better and here we are today so anyways
09:02 - that's kind of my programming journey I
09:04 - skipped over a bunch of different parts
09:06 - but this is something that to me is
09:07 - super interesting and that I think a lot
09:09 - of you guys maybe can relate to in the
09:11 - way that you learn programming and be
09:13 - challenged and all that so to quickly
09:14 - summarize kind of everything in just my
09:16 - last thoughts on this today I absolutely
09:19 - loved programming as you guys can't tell
09:21 - I'm learning something new almost every
09:23 - night and then I'm teaching it as well
09:25 - on YouTube and this is a great way for
09:26 - me to not only give back to you guys and
09:28 - help you know teach you and other kids
09:30 - that were once in my footsteps learn
09:32 - programming and learn the fundamentals
09:34 - from what I consider a good teacher and
09:36 - a good foundation but also to reinforce
09:39 - my skills in those so what I do usually
09:42 - when I do a YouTube video is I start the
09:43 - day or two before I learn the concept I
09:45 - practice it I apply it and then I teach
09:48 - it on YouTube to make sure I actually
09:49 - know what I'm talking about and it's
09:51 - really easy to tell when I don't because
09:53 - I'll start teaching and I'll realize hey
09:54 - you know what you have no idea what
09:56 - you're talking about go back relearn try
09:58 - again so anyways this is something that
10:00 - I'm really passionate about now and
10:01 - looking back at this I just want to help
10:03 - out the kids that were like me that
10:05 - weren't challenged that if they were
10:07 - introduced to programming have an
10:09 - ability to be to do something amazing
10:11 - and to just you know challenge
10:12 - themselves so that's why I'm so
10:14 - passionate about this and I put out
10:15 - these videos I try almost every day to
10:18 - help out programmers mostly in that
10:20 - beginner area get a strong foundation
10:22 - and just keep learning and doing better
10:25 - every day I also teach programming at a
10:27 - summer camp so I work at a summer camp
10:28 - that's really close to my house and a
10:30 - while ago they started this coding
10:32 - specialty so I actually teach Python
10:33 - programming to kids that are between 11
10:35 - and 14 years old and I can tell you it's
10:37 - a super rewarding feeling being able to
10:39 - see kids that never would have been
10:41 - introduced to programming or never would
10:43 - have seen this kind of computers or what
10:45 - not just absolutely excelling and loving
10:48 - what they're doing so with that being
10:49 - said I'm sorry if this video was a
10:51 - little bit rambling or it went on some
10:53 - different tangents or whatnot but I hope
10:55 - that you guys can get some value from
10:57 - this story and I'd love to hear your
10:58 - stories as well how you guys got into
11:00 - programming if you can relate in any way
11:02 - and yeah I just love to hear that in the
11:05 - comments down below so if you guys
11:06 - enjoyed the video
11:07 - make sure you leave a like and subscribe
11:09 - and with that being said I will see you
11:11 - guys in another Python programming
11:12 - tutorial
