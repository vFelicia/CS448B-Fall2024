00:00 - hey guys and welcome to the third Cavey
00:02 - tutorial so in today's video what we're
00:05 - gonna be doing is talking about how we
00:06 - can add a button into our layout how we
00:09 - can add some functionality for that
00:11 - button so like when you click the button
00:12 - maybe it gets the name and the last name
00:14 - and the email maybe it checks the emails
00:16 - valid we'll be messing around with some
00:18 - of that stuff and then in the next video
00:20 - what we're gonna be doing is talking
00:21 - about the kibbeh language so making
00:22 - daunt kv files so that we can kind of
00:25 - simplify all of this creation of widgets
00:27 - and all this which is not necessary but
00:29 - it makes our life a lot easier when we
00:32 - can figure out how to do that so
00:33 - essentially let's get started with
00:35 - adding this button so the way we can do
00:37 - that is I simply just be at an import
00:39 - button first of all so say Kitty dot u
00:42 - IX dot button import button and if and
00:45 - if you guys are curious about a lot of
00:47 - think the parameters for example like
00:48 - this is not the only text input
00:50 - parameter you can go on the kibbeh
00:51 - documentation which i'll leave in the
00:53 - description and on my website tech with
00:54 - tim dunn net and it will show you all
00:56 - the different parameters and things you
00:57 - can mess around with for example a label
00:59 - you could change the font size you can
01:01 - change the color there's a lot of other
01:02 - stuff which i will be talking about in
01:04 - future videos but for now if you're
01:06 - curious and the next video is not out
01:07 - you can look at that okay so what we're
01:10 - gonna do here to add a button okay so a
01:12 - button is pretty straightforward I'm
01:14 - gonna say self dot let say submits
01:17 - standing for that button is gonna be
01:19 - equal to a button and then on our button
01:21 - we're gonna do is gonna say text equals
01:23 - and then we'll just say submit and what
01:27 - I'm going to do is I'm actually gonna
01:28 - change the font size as well so font
01:30 - size equals let's play with 40 and see
01:33 - if that's too big or not okay so it's
01:36 - created a button now when we click this
01:38 - button or actually first we can add it
01:40 - to the window and I'll show you what it
01:41 - looks like then we can talk about some
01:42 - challenges you might have so self dot
01:43 - add widget' self thought submit let's
01:47 - just run this quickly and I've just
01:48 - changed this column back to two as
01:50 - opposed to three or six or whatever it
01:52 - was before you can see we get this
01:53 - submit button but when I click it
01:54 - nothing's really happening now it's
01:57 - great that it kind of fills this whole
01:58 - square but maybe we want it to be in the
02:00 - middle so how would we go about adding
02:02 - this to the middle so let's do that
02:04 - first
02:04 - I sort to add this to the middle is
02:06 - actually a bit more complex than you
02:08 - might think now in other kind of GUIs
02:10 - you can do something called column span
02:12 - which means I could say that this
02:13 - spans two columns and it would be the
02:15 - entire bottom now the issue with that
02:18 - here is that we can't do that so what we
02:19 - actually need to do if we want it to be
02:21 - centered is we need to do something
02:25 - that's a bit more complex now what that
02:27 - is is we need to create another grid
02:29 - layout inside of this grid layout and
02:33 - then add it to the other grid layout so
02:35 - essentially it's kind of hard to explain
02:37 - or do a little drawing here quickly
02:39 - let's delete all that so if we have like
02:42 - this and this is our main grid layout
02:44 - right and maybe we have one column in
02:47 - two rows so it looks something like this
02:49 - okay one column two rows now what we're
02:51 - gonna have to do is we're gonna have to
02:53 - add another grid layout that goes in
02:54 - here that would be it like let's say for
02:57 - example two rows and two columns so
02:59 - maybe we do something like this and to
03:02 - this so now this is a grid layout inside
03:05 - of this other grid layout and then we
03:07 - can just add our button down here which
03:09 - will span the entire bottom like that so
03:12 - we're gonna have a layout inside of
03:13 - another layout and it's actually good to
03:15 - show you because you're gonna have to do
03:16 - this quite a bit
03:17 - okay so let's clear that and let's
03:18 - actually worry about how we would do
03:20 - that so essentially since we want this
03:22 - button to span the whole bottom it's
03:23 - gonna be in the main grid layout and
03:25 - then all this stuff that we've already
03:27 - created has to be in the other layout so
03:29 - let's start by actually just creating
03:30 - another layout so we're gonna say self
03:32 - dot inside and this is gonna be equal to
03:36 - grid layout cuz it's gonna be a new grid
03:38 - layout right okay and what we're gonna
03:41 - do is now we're gonna say self dot
03:44 - inside dot calls equals to okay and now
03:49 - what all we're gonna do is just replace
03:51 - all of these add widgets so we're gonna
03:53 - do self thought inside add widget and
03:56 - then what we're gonna do is we're going
03:58 - to add at the very end
04:02 - all of these are this entire grid layout
04:04 - into the main grid layout and you'll see
04:06 - what I mean in a second so self up
04:07 - inside dot add widgets wherever you see
04:10 - add widget you just just add this dot
04:12 - inside and we'll do this again got
04:15 - inside dot inside and this is not the
04:19 - most efficient way to go about things
04:20 - but so we're gonna do and then here we
04:23 - can leave this as add widget because of
04:26 - what we're gonna do now okay
04:27 - so now what we have is essentially we
04:29 - have a new grid layout that contains all
04:32 - of this ok so it contains our what do
04:36 - you call it our last name email first
04:37 - name and then the text fields that go
04:39 - with that now currently that is not on
04:42 - our main layout just when we're
04:44 - returning my grid here in build we
04:47 - wouldn't actually see this right now
04:48 - because all this stuff is a part of
04:50 - inside it's not actually a part of this
04:52 - class so the way we have to do that is
04:54 - we have to add it to this this class so
04:57 - to do that we'll say self-thought add
04:59 - widget' and when we add widget' we're
05:01 - gonna add this entire layout so we're
05:03 - gonna add inside so do that we'll say
05:06 - self thought inside and there's one more
05:08 - thing we have to do is we have to
05:10 - actually configure the amount of columns
05:12 - for our main class because now be
05:14 - changed self thought inside calls to be
05:16 - equal to two but for our main layout
05:18 - we're gonna need it to be equal to one
05:20 - right so we'll say self dot calls equals
05:22 - one and not out actually we don't have
05:25 - to do anything else with button because
05:27 - remember we're just gonna add button to
05:28 - the main layout so now if we run this it
05:30 - should actually be working and there we
05:33 - go so we have first name last name email
05:34 - and submit now this might be big a bit
05:37 - large for us and we can actually change
05:39 - the size and we'll do the next video you
05:41 - can see this is now how we can kind of
05:43 - add multiple layouts into one so we'll
05:45 - have hello we can like type some stuff
05:48 - like yes I'm gonna do an axe at Gmail
05:51 - right we can click Submit okay so now
05:54 - let's get into actually messing with
05:55 - this button and what happens when we
05:57 - click that submit button so what I want
06:00 - to do actually is I need to bind a
06:01 - function to the an event now when this
06:06 - button is pressed
06:07 - I want a function to be called so let's
06:10 - first actually create the function
06:11 - that's gonna be called when we press
06:13 - that button so I'm gonna say define
06:14 - pressed okay and this needs to just take
06:18 - one parameter instance okay and I'll
06:22 - talk about why we need that in a second
06:23 - and in here we're just gonna print press
06:26 - okay like that now what I need to do is
06:29 - I got to go back to where I created my
06:31 - button and I need to bind this button to
06:33 - this function pressed so that when we
06:35 - press it it calls this function so let's
06:37 - say self dot submit
06:40 - bind like this I believe that's how you
06:42 - do it I have to have a look here dot
06:44 - bind and then what we're gonna do is
06:46 - when I say on underscore press equals
06:49 - and then pressed like this okay and
06:52 - we're actually gonna need to do self
06:54 - thought press because again this is a
06:55 - method of our class okay so now what's
06:58 - sure to happen if I didn't make mistake
07:00 - and I may have is we're gonna have
07:02 - whatever we press this button it prints
07:04 - pressed out to the screen so let's try
07:06 - this and see if it's working
07:07 - so if I click Submit you can see that
07:09 - now it prints press down here in the
07:11 - console and I can click it as many times
07:13 - as I want and you can see it continues
07:14 - to do that so that's great but there's a
07:17 - few things that I want to do inside of
07:18 - this so I probably want to grab the text
07:20 - of the name the last name the email and
07:23 - maybe clear that text out grab its store
07:26 - it do something with it so let's show
07:27 - how we can do that so let's let's just
07:30 - set up a few variables here so I'm gonna
07:31 - say name is equal to and the way that we
07:33 - actually grab the text from one of our
07:35 - text inputs here is we just say self
07:38 - thought name because that's the name of
07:39 - our text input text and this is how we
07:42 - can actually access the text from
07:44 - whatever they typed in name right so
07:46 - it's name so we'll say it last just
07:47 - standing for last name maybe self
07:49 - thought last name dot text then we'll
07:53 - say email equals and if I spelled email
07:56 - correctly equals self email dot txt and
08:02 - that's again how we get all the text
08:03 - from our different text input like
08:06 - attributes okay so we have all those now
08:08 - so we can start by doing is just
08:10 - printing all these things out so I'll
08:12 - just do it
08:12 - actually it let's just do it like this
08:14 - we'll just say name and then we'll call
08:17 - a name like this don't know what I'm
08:22 - doing here name and I will do last name
08:24 - and we'll just display all these things
08:26 - so that we can see nice and easy what
08:29 - everything is so that would do email and
08:32 - email like that okay sweet so let's run
08:35 - this and let's try it now so if I type
08:37 - in my name Tim and let's say tech and
08:40 - then we'll do Tim at tackle with Tim net
08:45 - which is actually my email and I click
08:46 - Submit you can see it says the name is
08:48 - Tim the last name is tech and the email
08:50 - is Tim at Tech with Tim net and
08:52 - we have this information we can do
08:54 - essentially whatever we want with it
08:55 - right and I'll show you actually so once
08:58 - we print this out how we can clear these
09:00 - box how we can clear the text out of
09:02 - this boxes because usually when you
09:03 - click Submit you want to clear
09:05 - everything out so they could like
09:06 - rem-pod or do something right so the way
09:08 - we could do that is the exact same kind
09:09 - of way we're doing this so we'll just
09:11 - copy this here say self dot name dot
09:13 - text equals and then here we'll say
09:16 - let's just like a blank string right
09:19 - yeah okay I don't know why I was
09:20 - blanking on that but we'll do that blank
09:22 - string this one is gonna be a blank
09:24 - string as well and self dot email the
09:26 - text is going to be a blank string as
09:29 - well so let's run this and let's see if
09:33 - we get it to work so let's just type
09:34 - some in here if I click Submit you can
09:36 - see that it clears that and it shows me
09:38 - what I typed there great so now we know
09:41 - how to grab information how to clear
09:42 - things how we combine buttons how to
09:44 - kind of mess with different layouts so I
09:46 - think I'm gonna end the video here in
09:48 - the next video we'll do be talking about
09:49 - the KB language we're going to allow us
09:51 - to style things a lot easier and a lot
09:53 - nicer and then again we're gonna get
09:55 - some more logic stuff and yeah so be as
09:58 - enjoying the video please make sure you
09:59 - leave a like and subscribe I will see
10:01 - you again in the next one
10:03 - [Music]
