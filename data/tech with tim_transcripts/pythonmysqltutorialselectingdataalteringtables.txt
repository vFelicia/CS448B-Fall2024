00:00 - hello everyone and welcome back to their
00:01 - MySQL tutorial so what we're gonna do in
00:03 - today's video is do some more advanced
00:05 - queries we're gonna retouch on that
00:06 - select query that I mentioned a little
00:08 - bit in the last video and we'll talk
00:10 - about some new ones about how we can
00:11 - modify the table and alter it and then
00:13 - in the next video we'll probably touch
00:15 - on something called foreign keys and
00:16 - then from there we'll actually deploy
00:18 - this out to a server and maybe do some
00:20 - example code and show how we actually
00:22 - use this in a real project so with that
00:24 - being said let's go ahead and get
00:25 - started so I've actually cleared the
00:27 - table I made in the last video so I'm
00:29 - kind of starting off fresh here so that
00:31 - means the first thing I need to do is
00:32 - actually create a new table so what I'm
00:33 - gonna do is say my cursor executes
00:36 - create table and now what I'm gonna do
00:39 - is actually add some different kind of
00:41 - values into this table to show you some
00:43 - different ones that you can use so I'm
00:45 - just gonna call this one test because
00:46 - it's not really gonna have any I don't
00:48 - know unified information so there's
00:50 - gonna be random so we're gonna start by
00:51 - having a name that'll be equal to
00:53 - variable character 50 and then what else
00:56 - could we have well I want to have a date
00:58 - so the date that this was created on so
01:01 - I'm going to say created equals
01:02 - date/time then I want to have a gender
01:05 - so I'm gonna say gender and this is
01:08 - actually going to be equal to an enum
01:10 - and when enum is is allows you to select
01:12 - between a few different values and I'll
01:14 - talk about this in a second once I
01:15 - finished typing it here so essentially
01:17 - when I put enum here what this means is
01:20 - you can select either male female or
01:22 - other so oh all right those are the
01:24 - three options that will be accepted for
01:26 - this gender block here and that's just
01:28 - what an enum value is now what date/time
01:31 - is it's actually a Python date/time
01:33 - object and you can see up here I've
01:34 - imported date/time from daytime so what
01:37 - I want to insert an entry here what I
01:39 - can do is use this date/time module it
01:41 - will give me the date and time and I can
01:42 - store it in the correct format in this
01:44 - now the last thing I want to add is an
01:45 - ID and I'll say the ID is int primary
01:50 - key I think I spelled that right and
01:53 - then what else do we need not to know
01:55 - Auto underscore increment like that and
02:00 - I'm just gonna add not note to the rest
02:01 - of these because we don't want them to
02:03 - be nope like that
02:06 - and last one and then we can execute
02:09 - this and we should be good to go so
02:11 - let's run this command the
02:13 - we go we're good a quick recap I mean
02:15 - that we did the enum thing that's kind
02:17 - of the only new value here primary key
02:19 - means this is now gonna be auto
02:20 - incrementing because we have this and
02:22 - this is gonna be the way that we access
02:23 - any element in test is by the ID so
02:26 - let's comment this out now and now let's
02:28 - actually insert some items in and talk
02:30 - about selecting so again quick recap
02:33 - here what I'm gonna do is just insert
02:34 - some items so I'm gonna say Mike my
02:36 - cursor dot execute and in this case
02:39 - we'll say insert into what is its test
02:44 - like that then we're gonna put the name
02:46 - of the column so we need name like that
02:49 - we created and we need gender okay so
02:55 - now that we have that will say values
02:57 - here and then we'll do % s % s % s like
03:02 - that now we can actually put the values
03:04 - in a what do you call it topple here and
03:06 - then we can add them in so for the name
03:09 - we will say Tim for ice will leave L
03:12 - capitals for the created date what we
03:14 - actually need to do is say date/time dot
03:18 - now and that's gonna give us the current
03:21 - date and time like at the current point
03:22 - in which we entered this in and then
03:24 - after this what do we need well we need
03:27 - to pick a gender and in this case I'm
03:29 - gonna pick male so again you have to
03:31 - choose between one of these three values
03:33 - otherwise that's not gonna work okay so
03:35 - now that we have that let's actually
03:36 - commit these changes so say DB commit
03:40 - like that run this and we're good to go
03:42 - and let's insert some more here just so
03:44 - we have some so let's say like Joe
03:47 - that'll be male as well and then let's
03:49 - add I don't know Joey we can do that one
03:54 - so we can test some comparisons let's
03:56 - just say that's a female and okay we'll
03:58 - stick with that for right now okay so
04:00 - now that we have that I want to show you
04:01 - the Select command and how we can
04:03 - actually select specific values from our
04:05 - table so I talked about it briefly in
04:07 - the last one but if I want to select
04:09 - different values that are inside my
04:11 - table I can actually put some conditions
04:13 - on them so I can select maybe all the
04:15 - females or all the males or all the
04:17 - people that have you know the name Joe
04:18 - year that start with the T I can do as
04:20 - specific as I want and that's what I can
04:22 - do with this select man so what I'm
04:24 - gonna do here is I'm going to
04:25 - a my cursor dot execute and in this case
04:30 - we're gonna say select star from test
04:35 - where and now what I can do after we're
04:38 - is put a condition so in this case I
04:40 - could say something like where and let's
04:42 - just pick a column let's do where gender
04:46 - equals and in this case we will say male
04:50 - now what I can do is loop through this
04:52 - so I'm gonna say for X in my cursor
04:55 - print X so let's run that and now we can
04:59 - see that we actually get the two entries
05:01 - that I put in my table which were Tim
05:02 - and Joe because they are both males okay
05:05 - so I just tried to order these a messed
05:06 - up but the way that we can actually
05:07 - order these entries when we get them so
05:10 - let's just run this one more time so we
05:11 - can see them say we want to order them
05:13 - by ID and we want the ID to be you know
05:15 - greatest to least what we can actually
05:17 - do is add another clause here that says
05:19 - order by and then when we can do is pick
05:22 - the column name so in this case maybe
05:24 - I'm gonna say I don't know
05:26 - ID and then here I will say either a SC
05:29 - which stands for ascending or DSC DSSC
05:32 - sorry which stands for descending so if
05:35 - I do that now you can see I when I go
05:37 - descending we're gonna get the greatest
05:39 - first and then it's gonna go downwards
05:40 - and that is kind of how we can execute
05:42 - these queries now say we don't actually
05:44 - care about all this information like we
05:46 - don't care about the date we don't care
05:47 - about the name maybe we just want the
05:49 - gender and maybe we just want I don't
05:51 - know some specific piece of information
05:52 - well what I can do is actually just put
05:54 - the column that I want here and it will
05:56 - only select that column from the from
05:59 - the entries so I say select ID from test
06:01 - where gender equals merit order by ID
06:03 - and now you can see that I just get two
06:06 - and I just get one now if we want more
06:08 - than one piece of information I could go
06:09 - like ID name and now you can see it's
06:11 - actually gonna give it to us in that
06:12 - order as well where we get the ID first
06:15 - and then the name and again obviously
06:16 - these are corresponding to the elements
06:18 - that are in there now I could change
06:20 - this to female and you can see that now
06:22 - we get Joey because that's our only
06:23 - female in there and that is kind of how
06:25 - this Select works you can get pretty
06:26 - advanced with this and do some like
06:28 - pretty complex queries but for now I'm
06:30 - just gonna leave it at that as that's
06:32 - pretty straightforward and you can
06:33 - already do quite a bit with that okay so
06:35 - now that we have that I want to talk
06:37 - about how we can
06:38 - a fire table so maybe once in a while
06:40 - you know we add some stuff into our
06:42 - table and we realize we need to add a
06:44 - new column or we need to change the name
06:45 - of a column or maybe you know it was a
06:47 - small Internet we need to make it a big
06:48 - int or something like that well how do
06:50 - we do that well there's actually a
06:52 - command for this in Maya school as you
06:54 - guys probably guessed and it is called
06:56 - alter so we can actually alter our
06:58 - tables so the way to alter table is you
07:00 - start by saying alter table and then you
07:03 - type the name of the table in this case
07:05 - it's going to be test and then whatever
07:06 - the alteration is that you want to do
07:08 - now in this case the most basic one we
07:10 - can do is add a new column so to do that
07:11 - I'm gonna say add column and I'm going
07:15 - to give the name of the column so maybe
07:16 - in this case we'll do like I'm trying to
07:18 - think of a decent example let's just do
07:20 - like food and this could be equal to var
07:22 - chair 50 so from that first example in
07:24 - that first video where we said you know
07:25 - maybe each person has a favorite food
07:27 - that's something we could do there now
07:29 - we can also add you know they can
07:30 - strange not know like that and now we
07:34 - can commit this so I guess DB Dutch
07:38 - commits or actually sorry I don't need
07:40 - to commit that I don't know what I'm
07:41 - doing now if I run that we're good to go
07:43 - and now what I'm gonna do is just run
07:45 - another command here so my cursor
07:46 - executes and I'm just gonna describe
07:50 - this table so that we can see what it
07:52 - looks like so describe test and then
07:55 - what I'm gonna do is print out my cursor
07:57 - and I'm gonna show you a cool way that
07:59 - we don't have to loop through it every
08:00 - time to see the output so what I can do
08:02 - is if I know I'm only getting one line
08:04 - of output I can actually just print out
08:06 - my cursor dot fetch one now you're gonna
08:11 - see this isn't gonna work for this but
08:12 - if I do that what it will do is just get
08:14 - me the first entry that is returned by
08:17 - my cursor so say we know we're only
08:18 - having one line of output we can just do
08:20 - my cursor don't fetch one and print that
08:22 - out directly rather than having to loop
08:24 - through it now since this has more than
08:25 - one column I need to show all of them so
08:27 - I'm gonna say for X in my cursor print X
08:33 - okay so there we go now we get all of
08:35 - our columns so we have name created
08:37 - gender ID and our newly added column
08:40 - food now let's say we decide that you
08:42 - know we'd actually don't want food
08:43 - anymore that's we don't want that how do
08:45 - we remove that from our table well to do
08:47 - that and actually I'll leave the
08:49 - describe
08:49 - so we can see it after I'm gonna say my
08:51 - cursor dot execute as usual and in this
08:54 - case all I have to do is say alter table
08:57 - test drop and then the column name so in
09:01 - this case the column name was food so
09:02 - let's do food and if I run this now you
09:04 - can see that when we read ascribe the
09:06 - table there is no column name food as we
09:08 - dropped it and got rid of it okay so
09:11 - those are some basic alterations but
09:13 - another one that we can do is actually
09:14 - change the name of our columns and even
09:16 - the name of the tables as well so to
09:18 - change the name of a column what you can
09:20 - do is say alter table test and then you
09:23 - can put the keyword and change the name
09:25 - of the previous column which in this
09:26 - case will just change name to be equal
09:29 - to first underscore name and then you
09:31 - have to redefine the type that you want
09:32 - to change it to so in this case varchar'
09:35 - 50 like that let's run that and you can
09:38 - see now we've changed name to first name
09:40 - so I just want to show you something
09:42 - that you have to be careful with when
09:44 - you do that do this so let's say I want
09:46 - to change the first name column we want
09:48 - to leave it the same name so first name
09:49 - but I want to change the type of it to
09:51 - var chair two or something like that
09:53 - now what do you think is gonna happen
09:55 - when I do this remember I already have
09:57 - entries in my table that have names
10:00 - right they already have variable
10:01 - character names and some of them have a
10:03 - length greater than two so what happens
10:05 - when I try to change it so that that
10:06 - information might not be able to be
10:08 - stored anymore well when I run this we
10:10 - actually get an error and it's saying
10:12 - here data truncated four column first
10:15 - name at Row one so it's essentially
10:17 - saying there's an issue here you can't
10:18 - do that because based on some of the
10:20 - entries you currently have in the
10:21 - database well we cannot change this type
10:24 - because it won't be local the
10:25 - information now if I change this to four
10:27 - though that'll work fine because there's
10:29 - no name inside my database that has a
10:31 - length greater than four so that is kind
10:33 - of how you go about changing the name of
10:36 - the columns now we can also change the
10:38 - name of the tables we can do all kinds
10:39 - of stuff there's tons of different alter
10:41 - commands but that is kind of the basics
10:44 - of how to do that so what I've kind of
10:46 - shown you guys so far here is just how
10:48 - to what do you call it create a table
10:50 - using like enums and dates and all that
10:52 - kind of stuff how we can alter the
10:54 - tables after we've done that and how we
10:56 - can select specific entries from our
10:58 - table using custom at bay
11:00 - queries so I'm gonna cut it here there
11:02 - is so many more queries I could show you
11:03 - I'm just trying to introduce you guys to
11:05 - some of them so you have an idea what's
11:06 - possible in MySQL because the reality is
11:09 - most of the time you're gonna have to
11:10 - look up how you want how to do what you
11:12 - want to do but in the next video what
11:14 - I'll be doing is showing you something
11:15 - called foreign keys which are really
11:17 - important and powerful for referencing
11:19 - other tables from specific rows in one
11:21 - table so notice that has been it for
11:23 - MySQL if you guys enjoyed this make sure
11:24 - you leave a like and subscribe and I'll
11:26 - see you in the next tutorial
