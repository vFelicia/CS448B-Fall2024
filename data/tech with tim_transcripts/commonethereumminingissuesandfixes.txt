00:00 - hey guys welcome back to another youtube
00:02 - video in today's video I'm gonna be
00:04 - going over some of the common errors
00:06 - that people have when trying to mine
00:07 - aetherium strictly software related I'm
00:11 - gonna be going over how to fix those
00:12 - issues so in my last video how to mine
00:14 - aetherium for beginners I was talking
00:17 - about well obviously how to mine
00:18 - aetherium and I got a lot of comments
00:19 - saying yes it worked and I got an equal
00:22 - amount of comments saying no this didn't
00:24 - work when I opened my command prompt it
00:27 - just crashes I got red text and so on so
00:30 - I'm just gonna be going over those
00:31 - issues and talking about how you can fix
00:33 - that so first let's see an example of
00:36 - what an issue looks like so this is one
00:38 - that I believe you guys we're having
00:39 - from the comments I saw so pretty much
00:41 - you were saying right when you run your
00:43 - batch file it just closes right away so
00:47 - it comes up like this you can see every
00:49 - time I run it it just closes right away
00:50 - a bunch of text comes down and then it
00:52 - closes well the first thing we need to
00:54 - do here is we need to read what this
00:56 - text is saying because believe it or not
00:58 - it actually is showing an error message
00:59 - at the end on why this isn't working
01:01 - properly and we need to be able to read
01:03 - that error message now the issue is how
01:06 - can we read it when it goes so quickly
01:08 - so I'm gonna show you how to do that
01:09 - first so you can first figure out what
01:12 - is wrong with your minor so we can do
01:15 - this by just clicking on command prompt
01:17 - like this and by the way while I do this
01:18 - I just want to mention if you haven't
01:19 - seen my last video how to mine a theorem
01:22 - for beginners go check that out first as
01:24 - its gonna go over how to do it and then
01:26 - this will go over if you had any issues
01:28 - doing that how how we can fix that so
01:31 - now what we need to do is we need to
01:33 - change our directory into the correct
01:37 - directory so we need to find our mining
01:40 - directory so mine is called miner right
01:42 - here this is where I have my batch file
01:44 - and that's what we need to get into so
01:46 - to change your directory using command
01:48 - prompt you type CDU which stands for
01:51 - change directory and then the name of
01:52 - the directory you want to change to so
01:55 - on the left side here it shows your
01:57 - current directory in this case I am
01:58 - currently in the user 1 my user
02:01 - directory so I want to first go to
02:03 - desktop and then I want to get into that
02:05 - folder so I'm gonna do CD minor now if
02:09 - you want to go back a directory so say
02:12 - you went into the wrong file
02:13 - can type CD dot dot and you see that
02:15 - moves me back a directory I'm just gonna
02:18 - go back into the correct one and then if
02:20 - you want to see a list of all of the
02:21 - directories you can type a tree
02:24 - oops so tree you have to type before so
02:29 - say if I do CD dot dot and then I type
02:31 - tree like this then it shows me all the
02:34 - directories that are in my desktop so
02:36 - you can see the name of them if you're
02:37 - not sure alright so let's just go back
02:39 - into my folder so C D minor by the way
02:42 - if you still have it as the default name
02:44 - of claymores dual whatever just change
02:46 - it to something that's easier to type in
02:47 - so you don't have to type in that whole
02:48 - mess all right so now that we're in that
02:50 - directory this directory right here we
02:53 - want to get the name of our batch file
02:55 - so in this case we call it start with
02:57 - all capitals dot bat so all we have to
02:59 - do to actually run that is just click
03:01 - start type start dot bat like so now
03:05 - once you type that it should run it in
03:07 - here you'll see the lines of text come
03:10 - down and then you will see at the bottom
03:11 - an error message now this just says that
03:14 - this name here is not recognized as an
03:16 - internal or external command opera
03:18 - program or batch file so that pretty
03:21 - much means well this does not exist now
03:23 - this is the first common issue and this
03:26 - means that you pretty much downloaded an
03:28 - outdated version and you need to
03:29 - download a newer version so it's a
03:31 - really easy fix to do this all we need
03:33 - to do is we need to go to the website so
03:36 - we can go to ether mind or I'll put a
03:38 - link in the description you're gonna
03:39 - scroll down so usually if you go to the
03:40 - top it looks like this until you get to
03:44 - somewhere that says claymores minor and
03:45 - then we're gonna click on the Bitcoin
03:47 - talk thread which will bring you to a
03:49 - page like this now in my last video I
03:53 - said ok just go to google and download
03:55 - the latest version now obviously if
03:58 - you're watching this that didn't work
03:59 - for you so we're gonna try this
04:00 - sometimes we're gonna go to omega
04:01 - because you can see here it says that
04:03 - google blocks some files and if you
04:04 - can't find the latest version use mega
04:06 - so we're gonna do that we go to make up
04:09 - it will list the newer versions just
04:12 - find the newest one as the zip archive
04:14 - and download that version so I've
04:17 - already done that it's this file right
04:18 - here
04:19 - you're gonna download that open it up
04:21 - and then simply get all of these files
04:25 - here and just put them in
04:26 - folder on your desktop so I've already
04:28 - done that and I have one right here
04:30 - which is claymores dual aetherium
04:33 - Deckard mine or whatever and you can see
04:35 - we now actually have this file which is
04:37 - one that we were missing in the last one
04:39 - inside of our directory and that's
04:41 - because of it it's the newer version
04:43 - alright so now we need to do the same
04:45 - thing in here and we need to create a
04:47 - patch file so we can run our miner so
04:49 - let's actually we'll leave this open
04:51 - just to see if it's working laughter so
04:54 - yeah so let's start up our miner so
04:57 - again we need to create a batch file if
04:59 - you watched my last video you know how
05:00 - to do that already
05:01 - so I've already actually created a batch
05:03 - file and I'm just gonna open this up to
05:04 - show you what's inside of it so let me
05:07 - just get rid of this for one second so
05:09 - we have this it's the same basic batch
05:11 - file I have my miner name I have my pool
05:14 - that I've set here and then I have my
05:17 - address my theorem address right here
05:19 - again if you need help doing this go
05:20 - watch my other video I go over how to do
05:22 - it alright so now that we've done that
05:25 - we can double click on our batch file
05:27 - and everything should be good right so
05:28 - let's wait see if everything works and
05:30 - we get red text again and yeah so how do
05:35 - we fix that
05:36 - now same thing if you want to read that
05:38 - whole thing again you can do the same
05:40 - process I showed to run this file I've
05:42 - already read it and pretty much that red
05:44 - text there is saying there's an issue
05:46 - with this pool and you need to type
05:50 - something else into your batch file to
05:52 - make it work and this is a new thing
05:53 - that has just shown up so don't worry if
05:55 - you followed my last video and it didn't
05:57 - work at that time everything was working
05:59 - fine but this now we need to add
06:02 - something to our miner so we can go
06:05 - ahead and we can click Edit right here
06:06 - and then at the end here
06:09 - it's a very simple fix I don't know
06:11 - exactly how it works but all we have to
06:12 - do is just type - all pools like so one
06:17 - now don't ask me why this works but
06:20 - pretty much it just does you can do all
06:22 - pools one and now if we run it we should
06:25 - see some green text hopefully coming up
06:27 - showing us that everything is working
06:29 - like so so yeah that is pretty much the
06:33 - fix to two of the common problems that I
06:36 - was having Mining theorem and that you
06:38 - guys were having mining aetherium
06:39 - and this has just come up recently so
06:42 - don't worry if you followed my last
06:43 - video completely and it didn't work this
06:46 - is a new thing so yeah if you guys liked
