00:00 - the next project I'm going to recommend
00:01 - is creating a decentralized exchange now
00:04 - obviously this is going to be a more
00:05 - basic version the ones like pancake swap
00:07 - or other very popular ones you may have
00:09 - used before so you can create something
00:11 - very basic where say one user submits a
00:13 - custom erc20 token to a decentralized
00:16 - exchange contract then someone can buy
00:18 - that token or tokens at a specified
00:20 - price the next way would be to create
00:22 - something like a liquidity pool now if
00:24 - you were to create a liquidity pool what
00:25 - you would need to do is have an erc20
00:27 - token which is your LP token your
00:29 - liquidity pool token and you would give
00:31 - that token to users for providing
00:33 - liquidity in your pool it's not overly
00:36 - complicated if you do kind of a
00:37 - simplistic version of a liquidity pool
00:39 - and you can learn again how to exchange
00:41 - and transfer tokens how to actually do
00:43 - like a trade if someone wants to trade
00:44 - their ether for a specific token or a
00:46 - token for ether Etc
