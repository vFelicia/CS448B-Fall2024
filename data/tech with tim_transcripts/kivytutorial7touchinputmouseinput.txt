00:00 - hey guys and welcome to another Kibby
00:02 - tutorial so in today's video I'm gonna
00:04 - be showing you how we can get kind of
00:06 - mouse input and also uh like finger
00:08 - input so like if someone was for it to
00:10 - example touch the screen with their
00:11 - thumb or like drag something around or
00:13 - whatnot this will work for all of that
00:15 - and then I think in the next video just
00:17 - give you a quick kind of summary of
00:18 - what's going on I want to get into
00:20 - drawing some things so for example maybe
00:22 - you want to use kevie for some kind of
00:23 - game development or something like that
00:24 - how can we draw kind of object shapes
00:26 - move those around and then we'll get
00:30 - into probably some more advanced stuff
00:32 - like creating multiple windows creating
00:33 - better applications where for example if
00:36 - you get the correct correct login it
00:38 - brings you to a page that gives you like
00:40 - your secret notes or something I don't
00:41 - really know exactly what I want to do
00:42 - but if you guys have any ideas please
00:43 - don't hesitate to let me know I'm
00:46 - thinking maybe sometime in the future I
00:47 - want to build kind of like a big GUI
00:49 - with this and walk you guys through how
00:50 - to really go into developing a proper
00:52 - application with Gibby
00:53 - but no promises on that it just kind of
00:56 - an idea that I had in my head so today
00:58 - we're getting input so we need to do
01:01 - actually is we're gonna have to re
01:02 - import our widgets so from kv2 IX start
01:07 - widgets import and will just import
01:10 - widget like that I'm sorry this is
01:13 - widget in case you didn't read along and
01:15 - what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create
01:17 - this class so I'm just gonna create
01:18 - class I'm gonna call it touch it's gonna
01:19 - stand for like getting our touch input
01:21 - it's gonna inherit from widget and then
01:23 - in here I'm gonna define a few functions
01:25 - and we'll go through and talk about what
01:27 - they are so the first one is gonna be on
01:28 - underscore oh and then you can have it
01:31 - here on touch down okay and let's define
01:33 - another one so define on touch move and
01:37 - what define on touch up like that
01:40 - perfect so we've already got three so we
01:43 - can just pass in here for right now but
01:45 - essentially what these functions are
01:47 - gonna do is they have one input
01:49 - parameter right so we have touch and
01:51 - what's just gonna happen is essentially
01:53 - when we touch down on the screen we will
01:55 - get the position or we'll be able to get
01:57 - the position of where we pressed and a
01:59 - few a few other piece of information as
02:01 - well we're not gonna really use those
02:02 - and then same thing with move and up so
02:05 - when we're moving while touching the
02:07 - screen we'll be able to get that
02:08 - information and then if we release will
02:10 - not be able to see where we released
02:12 - when we release
02:13 - but not so some useful functions and
02:15 - again since we're inheriting from widget
02:17 - this means that these functions just
02:18 - work on any what do you call it like a
02:21 - grid layout box layout float layout
02:24 - whatever you're using these work on
02:26 - those and yeah so we'll talk about that
02:29 - in a second so I'll just go in rkv file
02:31 - I want to just create a small window
02:32 - here so actually sorry back to the
02:34 - kibbeh file
02:35 - let's return touch first we don't forget
02:37 - let's go to the KB file and what I'm
02:39 - gonna do in here is I'm just gonna say
02:40 - touch and in here I'm just gonna create
02:43 - a button just to prove to you that
02:45 - indeed we can put things inside alright
02:47 - so we'll do button say text equals say
02:51 - my BTN why not and that's all we need
02:54 - for a kibbeh file I just want to add
02:56 - something to the screen so for on touch
02:58 - down obviously that means like we press
03:00 - down or we click the mouse button down
03:02 - so all I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna
03:03 - print and we'll say no stone and then we
03:09 - can just print out touch and if we do
03:11 - this it'll print out like the position
03:13 - of the touch for us okay so same thing
03:15 - with on touch move will print mouse move
03:20 - okay and then we'll print touch again
03:22 - and I assume you guys can probably guess
03:26 - what we're gonna be printing here we'll
03:28 - say Mouse up and touch okay so let's run
03:33 - this and just see invalid property name
03:35 - yes text equals I'm sure you guys all
03:38 - saw that and got mad at me so text : now
03:41 - let's run this we have my button
03:42 - obviously here and just look in the
03:44 - console in the bottom left while I'm
03:45 - doing this when I press Mouse down mouse
03:48 - up gives us the s position and the
03:51 - position s position I believe stands for
03:54 - like relative position where this is
03:57 - like the absolute position so that's
04:00 - actually useful because for example like
04:01 - with our float layouts maybe we were
04:03 - like 30 percent X we don't know the
04:04 - actual X value of that button so we'd
04:06 - want to use the S position to figure out
04:09 - where our mouse is just now notice if I
04:11 - drag along it should keep going yeah you
04:14 - can see that just spamming mouse move
04:16 - because I was just dragging along the
04:17 - screen and then we get excuse me there
04:20 - we get mouse up at the bottom so you can
04:23 - see how that works now just something to
04:25 - notice here if I do try to click my bud
04:26 - it's no longer actually clicking like
04:29 - it's not highlighting and that's because
04:31 - and I believe this is the reason someone
04:33 - correct me if I'm wrong but when we have
04:36 - like we override this what do you call
04:39 - it this function mouse down this
04:41 - function already exists and this would
04:44 - he call it a touch movie or what not
04:45 - they already exist inside of this widget
04:47 - class and when we create them in here
04:48 - what we're doing is we're overriding the
04:50 - functionality of the function that's in
04:53 - the widget class so usually what would
04:55 - happen is on touchdown that function
04:57 - would trigger the let's say button to
05:00 - change colors right so what we're doing
05:02 - essentially when we override this is
05:04 - we're changing that functionality and
05:05 - we're removing all the functionality the
05:07 - other function and implementing our own
05:09 - so if you wanted our button to change
05:11 - like state when we clicked it what we'd
05:14 - have to do is we have to import this
05:15 - object property so you know what let's
05:16 - just do it
05:17 - so from Kirito properties import object
05:22 - property and then remember how we create
05:24 - an object property so let's just say bt
05:26 - m equals object property
05:29 - we'll say none and i believe in the QB
05:32 - file we just got to create a global
05:33 - variable here so let's say b TN equals
05:36 - BTN ah
05:37 - does it : yeah it gets : we'll see
05:40 - though and I will say ID BTN now we can
05:44 - do is we can say for example on
05:45 - touchdown will say BTN dot uh what was
05:49 - it BT and maybe color opacity opacity we
05:53 - can try that equals 0.5 and we'll see if
05:57 - this works I could have just absolutely
05:59 - butchered that BTN it's gonna be self
06:01 - that BTN opacity go pass it there you go
06:06 - okay so let's run this and when I click
06:09 - it now you can see that the opacity
06:11 - changes now obviously I would probably
06:13 - want to well actually change this
06:14 - opacity back when we release the button
06:17 - so that's a afterthoughts will do a past
06:19 - equals one and now if we click it we
06:22 - hold down we release it now our button
06:24 - is actually pressing properly like it
06:26 - should have been before so that's how
06:28 - you can do that I know it's not an ideal
06:30 - way to kind of fix that but when you
06:32 - override these functions that's what you
06:33 - have to do so I knew this has been a
06:35 - short video but this is all I'm gonna
06:36 - show for right now in the next video
06:38 - we'll get into some more advanced stuff
06:39 - I want to do some drawing we're gonna
06:40 - mess with this more if you guys have any
06:42 - ideas for any videos other videos you'd
06:44 - like to see please let me know and with
06:46 - that being said I'll see you guys in
06:47 - another video
