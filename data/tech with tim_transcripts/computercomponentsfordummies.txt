00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:10 - youtube video so in today's video i'm
00:13 - gonna be giving you a pc component
00:15 - overview slash guide where i kind of
00:17 - walk you through the main components in
00:19 - a computer discuss what their purpose is
00:22 - how they work with the other components
00:24 - and then what you should look for when
00:25 - you're actually purchasing these
00:26 - components so whether you're buying a pc
00:29 - building a pc maybe purchasing a laptop
00:31 - it's really helpful to understand what
00:33 - each component is what the role is in
00:36 - the machine and what's actually going to
00:37 - make a difference in terms of your
00:38 - performance and day-to-day use of the
00:40 - computer so that's the goal of this
00:42 - video let's go ahead and get into it
00:44 - after quick word from our sponsor before

01:45 - again to altium designer for sponsoring
01:46 - this video and now let's dive in alright
01:49 - so let me begin by just walking you
01:50 - through the main components that every
01:52 - computer is going to have so in every pc
01:55 - every laptop doesn't matter what type of
01:57 - computer you have you're going to have a
01:59 - motherboard you're going to have a cpu
02:01 - that's your central processing unit
02:03 - you're going to have a ram which is
02:04 - random access memory you're going to
02:06 - have a graphics processing unit this may
02:08 - be a dedicated gpu so graphics
02:10 - processing unit or it may be integrated
02:12 - with your cpu you're then going to have
02:14 - some type of storage device so a hard
02:16 - drive or an ssd and then i just want to
02:19 - note here that any peripherals of things
02:20 - like a microphone a mouse a keyboard a
02:23 - monitor those are not a part of the
02:25 - actual computer those are things that
02:27 - are going to plug into the input or
02:28 - output devices of your motherboard and
02:31 - allow you to actually view what's
02:32 - happening on the computer so i just want
02:34 - to make that clear something like your
02:36 - monitor or your screen even if it's on a
02:38 - laptop that's not really a part of the
02:40 - actual computer the computer is simply
02:42 - the components that i just listed there
02:44 - may be a few other things depending on
02:45 - the build that you have but those are
02:47 - the main and kind of fundamental ones so
02:49 - with that said let's start going through
02:50 - each component i'll talk about the
02:52 - importance of them and which ones you
02:54 - really want to look out for when you're
02:55 - actually buying a computer and which
02:57 - ones are going to make the biggest
02:58 - difference for your day-to-day usage
03:00 - alright so let's begin with arguably one
03:02 - of the most important components which
03:03 - is the cpu now the cpu is the central
03:06 - processing unit and a lot of people like
03:08 - to think of this as the brains of the
03:10 - computer this is one of the most
03:12 - important parts it's speed is really
03:14 - going to dictate how fast your computer
03:16 - is and it's going to be responsible for
03:18 - doing all of the arithmetic all of the
03:20 - math and pretty much all of the heavy
03:22 - lifting of the computer now it's going
03:24 - to utilize all of the other components
03:26 - and it needs those other components to
03:27 - work properly but it is kind of the
03:29 - heart of the pc or the heart of the
03:31 - computer and with a poor cpu it doesn't
03:33 - matter what other components you have
03:35 - your computer is going to be slow so in
03:37 - terms of looking out for different cpus
03:39 - and kind of the properties of cpus
03:41 - you're going to have two main brands
03:43 - that you're going to be going to when
03:44 - you're purchasing a cpu or even
03:46 - purchasing a pre-built computer that
03:47 - comes with the cpu now that's going to
03:49 - be amd and intel now recently amd has
03:52 - been outperforming intel when it comes
03:54 - to value for cpus so personally i
03:57 - recommend amd cpus however intel does
03:59 - still have a large market share and tons
04:01 - of computers come with intel cpus it
04:04 - doesn't really matter if you have an
04:05 - intel vs amd cpu some are better at
04:08 - specific tasks but what you really want
04:10 - to look for when you're looking at a cpu
04:12 - is the specs of the cpu so the number of
04:15 - cores the speed of those cores and then
04:17 - the number of threads as well now when
04:19 - you're looking at a cpu i would say the
04:21 - minimum amount of cores that you really
04:23 - want to go with in 2021 is four now
04:25 - there is a lot of cpus that are dual
04:27 - core cpus you're going to see these in
04:29 - very entry-level machines very basic
04:31 - computers maybe even in things like
04:33 - phones now dual core cpus are fine if
04:35 - you're only doing something like web
04:37 - browsing or word processing but if you
04:39 - want to play any type of video game if
04:41 - you want to load multiple applications
04:42 - at the same time if you want a
04:44 - relatively snappy feel to your pc you're
04:47 - really going to want to go with at least
04:48 - four cores now when you're looking at
04:50 - cores you're probably also going to see
04:52 - something that says threats now
04:53 - typically the number of threads is going
04:55 - to be double the number of cores i don't
04:57 - want to get into that because this is
04:58 - kind of a video for beginners but
05:00 - essentially you don't really need to
05:01 - worry about the threads just look at the
05:03 - cores almost all modern cpus have
05:05 - something called hyper threading which
05:07 - kind of allows each core to perform
05:09 - multiple operations at a time that's why
05:11 - you'll see something like multiple
05:13 - threads or more threads than the number
05:14 - of cores
05:15 - now other than that you're going to see
05:17 - a speed for the core so if you see
05:19 - something like 3.8 gigahertz 4.2
05:22 - gigahertz and then you'll see things
05:24 - like turbo clock boost clock all of
05:26 - these kind of marketing things you'll
05:27 - see on cpus right the speed of the cpu
05:30 - is very important but one thing to note
05:31 - is that just because a cpu has a higher
05:33 - speed does not mean that it's going to
05:35 - outperform one with a lower speed for
05:38 - example if i have a cpu that has six
05:40 - cores and you have one that has two
05:42 - cores but your cores are clocked at four
05:44 - gigahertz that's the speed of your cpu
05:46 - my cpu even if it's clocked at say 2.5
05:49 - gigahertz is gonna outperform your cpu
05:51 - in almost every single task that core
05:54 - speed that you're seeing there is the
05:55 - speed of a single core so you can kind
05:58 - of multiply the speed by the number of
06:00 - cores and that will relatively tell you
06:02 - how quick the cpu is going to be now
06:04 - this is not a precise calculation and in
06:06 - some situations you do actually want a
06:08 - higher clock speed than the number of
06:10 - cores especially if you're running
06:12 - single threaded applications i'm not
06:13 - going to get into that again because
06:15 - this is for beginners but the idea is
06:17 - for most common people you're going to
06:19 - favor more cores over a higher clock
06:21 - speed and most modern cpus are going to
06:23 - be clocked at least 3 gigahertz which is
06:25 - going to be more than fast enough for
06:26 - you to have a very responsive and kind
06:28 - of fast experience using the computer
06:30 - alright so now let's talk about ram
06:32 - which is random access memory now ram is
06:34 - a temporary storage location now this
06:37 - means if you turn off your cpu anything
06:39 - in ram is going to disappear it's going
06:41 - to be gone now the point of ram is to
06:43 - store data that needs to be readily
06:45 - available to the cpu or the computer so
06:47 - it can very quickly be accessed and very
06:50 - quickly be changed so any programs that
06:52 - you're running on your computer will
06:53 - utilize a small amount of ram or if
06:55 - you're talking about something like
06:56 - google chrome a large amount of ram
06:58 - because they're going to be storing all
06:59 - of their program data in ram so it's
07:02 - very quick to access now this is in
07:04 - contrast to something like an ssd or a
07:06 - hard drive which is going to be a much
07:07 - slower storage medium but is going to be
07:09 - persistent meaning when you turn off the
07:11 - computer the data on there is going to
07:13 - stay it's not going to be deleted
07:15 - anyways let's talk about what you want
07:16 - to look for when you're looking for ram
07:18 - so ram has many different forums you
07:20 - have ddr2 ddr3 and ddr4 and one very
07:23 - important thing to note is that laptop
07:25 - ram is different than desktop ram so you
07:28 - cannot put laptop ram in your desktop
07:30 - that's not going to work so just keep
07:32 - that in mind i've know many people who
07:34 - have accidentally bought the wrong type
07:35 - of rep anyways the main kind of i guess
07:38 - types or generations of ram that we have
07:40 - right now is ddr3 and ddr4 now ddr3 is a
07:44 - much older style of ram that's probably
07:46 - a red flag if you're buying a computer
07:47 - if it has ddr3 you're gonna perfor
07:50 - prefer ddr4 sorry which has a much
07:52 - higher kind of stock speed now when
07:55 - we're looking at ram we have all kinds
07:56 - of speeds anywhere from something like
07:58 - two six six six megahertz uh to
08:00 - something like 3200 megahertz or 3600
08:03 - megahertz now the ram speed doesn't
08:06 - matter a ton for most of you but if you
08:08 - are building your own computer then you
08:09 - want to go with a higher ram speed
08:11 - rather than a lower ram speed now
08:13 - ideally the sweet spot is probably going
08:15 - to be around 32 to 3 400 megahertz for
08:18 - your ram but for most of you you're not
08:20 - gonna have that option and you're not
08:21 - even gonna see that speed if you're
08:22 - buying a pre-built computer so in terms
08:24 - of the amount of ram for most of you
08:26 - you're going to want either 8 or 16
08:28 - gigabytes of ram now you could get 4
08:29 - gigabytes of ram if you're going with a
08:31 - very entry-level computer but just keep
08:33 - in mind that this is going to be an
08:35 - entry-level computer it's going to be
08:36 - slow it's not going to be the most
08:37 - performant so i would recommend as a
08:39 - minimum for most people unless you're
08:41 - really on a budget eight gigabytes of
08:43 - rent now 16 gigabytes is going to be the
08:45 - sweet spot this is a really nice middle
08:47 - ground you almost never need more than
08:49 - 16 gigabytes and again for most of you
08:51 - you're going to want that amount now
08:52 - some of you may be saying well can't i
08:54 - get 17 gigabytes the answer is no you
08:56 - need to have a certain denomination of
08:58 - ram it's gonna be a power of two so
09:00 - either two gigabytes four gigabytes
09:02 - eight sixteen thirty two sixty four one
09:04 - twenty eight that's just how ram works
09:06 - you'll see some weird computers that
09:08 - have like six gigabytes of ram don't
09:09 - worry about that that's kind of an
09:11 - exception to what i'm saying for most of
09:12 - you again you're gonna want either eight
09:14 - or 16 gigs now if you are doing anything
09:17 - that is going to require more ram you
09:19 - have a really high end cpu you're doing
09:21 - video editing maybe you're rendering a
09:22 - bunch of stuff then you may want to
09:24 - consider going up to 32 gigabytes of ram
09:27 - and if you're doing machine learning ai
09:29 - a ton of data processing and you need
09:30 - that loaded for your models you probably
09:33 - might want to go up to 64. now in my
09:35 - personal computer i have 64 gigabytes of
09:37 - ram i have never needed to use that
09:39 - amount the most i've probably ever used
09:40 - to be like 32 gigs and even that again
09:44 - like 32 gigs would be completely fine
09:45 - for my computer now one kind of random
09:48 - rule of thumb here that i'm going to
09:49 - throw in is that if you have a very high
09:51 - end gpu so something like a 30 90 a 3080
09:53 - a titan then you're going to want to
09:55 - have double the amount of ram than your
09:57 - video memory now i'm going to talk about
09:59 - video memory in a second but if you have
10:01 - 24 gigabytes of vram you're going to
10:02 - want at least 48 gigabytes of ram which
10:05 - means you should probably go to 64. i
10:06 - won't talk about all the reasons for
10:08 - that but just keep that in mind in case
10:09 - you're getting a very high-end gpu so
10:11 - now let's move on to motherboard now the
10:13 - motherboard is going to be the bridge or
10:14 - the connection between all your
10:16 - different pc components so your graphics
10:18 - card your cpu your ram all of that is
10:21 - going to go directly on the motherboard
10:23 - and the way they're going to communicate
10:24 - is through the bus on the motherboard
10:26 - now the motherboard is also going to
10:27 - deliver power to the components unless
10:30 - the components have a their own separate
10:32 - kind of power connection
10:34 - anyways the motherboard is important but
10:35 - for most of you you're not going to have
10:37 - to pick it out or even look at the specs
10:39 - because it's just going to come with
10:40 - whatever computer you buy if you are
10:42 - building your own computer do some
10:44 - research i'm not going to talk about a
10:45 - ton in this video it is very important
10:47 - that you pick a motherboard that's
10:48 - compatible with your cpu your amount of
10:50 - ram and all of the expansion cards you
10:53 - may want to add and other features like
10:54 - fan headers uh and like extra usb ports
10:57 - and stuff like that now your motherboard
10:59 - will also have the input and output
11:01 - devices so it will have usb ports on it
11:03 - it will have audio jacks it might have
11:05 - an hdmi or vga port if you have an
11:07 - integrated graphics card
11:09 - all of this type of stuff uh anyways
11:11 - that's pretty much it for motherboard
11:12 - again not super important don't worry
11:14 - about it unless you are building your
11:16 - own computer in which case do some
11:18 - research all right so let's go to gpu
11:20 - which is graphics processing unit now
11:22 - this is very important if you are doing
11:24 - anything graphics intensive like 3d
11:26 - rendering
11:27 - video editing playing video games if
11:29 - that's the case you're going to want to
11:31 - get something known as a dedicated gpu
11:33 - however if you are not doing any of that
11:35 - then you can get an integrated gpu now
11:38 - an integrated gpu is built into the cpu
11:40 - which means you don't have to buy a
11:42 - separate component it's just already
11:44 - there now you do require either an
11:46 - integrated or a dedicated gpu to get a
11:49 - display output and the reason i'm saying
11:51 - that is because some cpus do not come
11:53 - with integrated graphics so most amd
11:56 - cpus do not have integrated graphics
11:58 - meaning you actually need a graphics
11:59 - card to get some output from the
12:01 - computer however most intel cpus do
12:04 - which means that you can just directly
12:05 - plug in a cable to the motherboard and
12:07 - you'll be able to actually see something
12:09 - on your monitor
12:10 - okay hopefully that makes sense now i
12:12 - don't want to go through all the
12:12 - different gpu models because there's so
12:14 - many and there's a lot of great reviews
12:16 - out there from people other than me but
12:18 - when you are buying a computer the first
12:19 - thing you want to consider is do i need
12:21 - a gpu or do i not need a gpu then you're
12:24 - gonna look at the different levels of
12:25 - gpus and depending on what you're doing
12:27 - and the specs of your other components
12:29 - you're gonna pick a gpu now you want
12:31 - your gpu to be balanced with your cpu
12:34 - amount of ram and all of that type of
12:36 - stuff don't go buy a 39 d if you have a
12:39 - 4 core cpu that's unnecessary and you're
12:41 - going to bottleneck this crazy gpu with
12:44 - a very poor cpu relative to the
12:46 - performance of the gpu alright so i was
12:48 - just editing this video and i realized i
12:49 - missed some important details in the gpu
12:51 - section so i just wanted to kind of fill
12:53 - those in here now i don't want to give
12:54 - you a treat though if you've stuck
12:56 - around until this point in the video and
12:58 - i'm going to show you that this is my
12:59 - cat this is fresca she's hanging out on
13:01 - the desk right here she's like always on
13:04 - my desk when i'm working which is nice
13:05 - but also quite annoying if i'm trying to
13:07 - type or something like that anyways i
13:08 - just wanted to introduce her in case you
13:10 - guys haven't seen her kind of walking
13:11 - around on the desk in my videos
13:14 - regardless let's now get into those
13:15 - missing details so gpus when you're
13:18 - looking at a dedicated gpu that's kind
13:19 - of what i'm going to be talking about
13:21 - now you're going to have two companies
13:22 - that are going to be providing the gpus
13:24 - amd and nvidia now nvidia is kind of the
13:27 - preferred company for gpus that's the
13:30 - one i personally recommend just because
13:32 - they're more mainstream they have like
13:34 - larger market share and uh their drivers
13:36 - and all these things are more compatible
13:38 - with more stuff they have some other
13:39 - cool features like nvidia broadcast
13:42 - which you can only get access to if you
13:43 - have specific uh series gpus from nvidia
13:47 - now also if i'm mispronouncing that let
13:49 - me know in the comments because i never
13:50 - know how to pronounce that company name
13:52 - anyways let's continue
13:54 - all right so amd totally fine if you get
13:56 - an amd gpu that's all right in fact most
13:58 - mac computers are going to come with an
14:00 - amd gpu and that's because i think they
14:02 - have some special like proprietary
14:04 - partnership regardless those are fine
14:06 - now when you're looking at the specs of
14:08 - a gpu the first thing you're going to
14:10 - want to look at is the generation of the
14:11 - gpu so is it first gen second gen third
14:14 - gen is it a 20 series is a 30 series you
14:16 - just want to look at how recent it is
14:18 - and obviously you're going to want to go
14:19 - for the most recent gpu that you can now
14:22 - other than that you're going to want to
14:23 - look at the amount of video memory now
14:26 - video memory otherwise known as vram is
14:28 - special dedicated memory very similar to
14:30 - regular ram but just for the graphics
14:33 - card now the graphics card is actually
14:35 - going to be responsible for rendering
14:37 - all of your frames so if you're playing
14:38 - a video game your video memory is going
14:40 - to act as a video buffer and what that
14:43 - means is you're going to have all of
14:44 - your frames and everything that you're
14:46 - going to be seeing kind of being stored
14:47 - in the vram first and then being passed
14:50 - to the display output where you'll
14:52 - actually see it on the screen now again
14:54 - take all this with a grain of salt it's
14:55 - just an over simplification to give you
14:57 - a general kind of explanation of what's
14:59 - going on but essentially the more video
15:01 - memory the better now as i said before
15:04 - you want to have double the ram of your
15:05 - video memory so if you have an 8 gig
15:08 - video memory card you want 16 gigabytes
15:10 - of ram this is just so you can load uh
15:13 - the vram of the gpu fast enough if you
15:15 - don't have enough ram then it's going to
15:17 - go slower it's not going to load as fast
15:19 - as it possibly can
15:20 - okay so in terms of the amount of vram
15:23 - you want the minimum you're probably
15:25 - gonna get is four now in some gpus there
15:27 - will be two gigabytes of ram that's
15:29 - pretty unnecessary at that point you
15:30 - don't even really need a dedicated gpu
15:33 - but in any gpu that is actually gonna do
15:35 - anything meaningful for you it's
15:36 - probably gonna have four gigabytes of
15:38 - ram now four gigabytes is nice to have
15:40 - if you're not going to be doing any
15:41 - super high res gaming or high settings
15:43 - gaming maybe you just want to do a
15:45 - little light video editing you want like
15:47 - some graphics power that's where you
15:48 - would go with four gigabytes but the
15:50 - sweet spot is gonna be six eight or 12
15:53 - gigabytes now for most people you're
15:54 - gonna be getting a card that has six or
15:56 - eight gigabytes in it as soon as you
15:58 - start going up to 12 or 24 gigabytes
16:00 - you're getting into the really expensive
16:02 - high-end graphics cards and at that
16:04 - point i probably don't need to tell you
16:05 - what to buy you probably already know
16:06 - what you're looking for anyways those
16:08 - are kind of the details i wanted to add
16:10 - in again i would prefer an nvidia gpu
16:12 - especially if you're gonna be gaming
16:14 - however if you're just doing some light
16:15 - video editing you could definitely go
16:17 - with the lower end gpu like an amd gpu
16:20 - that has four gigabytes of video memory
16:22 - now it's also very important again to
16:23 - look at the generation the older gen the
16:26 - gpu obviously the worse it's going to
16:28 - perform and the less features it's going
16:29 - to have the new high-end gpus have a ton
16:32 - of awesome features that most modern
16:34 - games will take advantage of say like
16:36 - ray tracing if you go with say a 10
16:37 - series nvidia gpu you're not gonna have
16:40 - those features so keep that in mind you
16:41 - definitely need to do more research on
16:43 - this before you buy a gpu but hopefully
16:45 - that gave you a few more details because
16:47 - before i felt like i was lacking all
16:49 - right so with that said i think i'm
16:50 - about ready to end this kind of you know
16:51 - random insertion into the video i will
16:54 - also mention that if you're buying a
16:55 - dedicated gpu and you're building your
16:57 - own computer consider your power supply
17:00 - because the high-end gpus require a lot
17:02 - of power sometimes up to say 300 watts
17:04 - so you want to make sure your power
17:06 - supply has the headroom to actually
17:08 - support that again you need to do more
17:09 - research on that if you're actually
17:10 - going to be building a computer all
17:12 - right now we can move on all right so
17:14 - now let's talk about persistent storage
17:16 - devices ssds and hard drives let me
17:19 - start with hard drives so a hard drive
17:21 - is actually a physical spinning magnetic
17:23 - disk that has a read and write head that
17:26 - is able to read magnetic charges off the
17:28 - disk that means that first of all if you
17:30 - bring a magnet near your hard drive you
17:32 - will erase all of the data because it is
17:33 - magnetically charged it also means it is
17:35 - a lot slower than a solid-state drive
17:38 - because you actually physically need to
17:40 - read um magnetic bits right from the
17:43 - hard drive now i won't get into all of
17:44 - the kind of mechanical aspects of it but
17:46 - the thing is this is actually mechanical
17:48 - you have moving parts which means it's
17:50 - more prone to failure but the one
17:52 - advantage of hard drives is they are a
17:54 - lot cheaper and they have a huge storage
17:56 - capacity so what i usually recommend
17:58 - people do is get one single hard drive
18:00 - as kind of their data drive where they
18:02 - store things like files images videos
18:05 - stuff that they're not loading
18:07 - frequently because if you're loading
18:08 - stuff like your operating system from a
18:10 - hard drive it's going to be very very
18:11 - slow all right so lastly we will end off
18:14 - with ssds now an ssd is a solid state
18:16 - drive it's a very fast storage medium
18:19 - much faster than a hard drive but is
18:21 - much more expensive and has lower
18:23 - capacity so what i will say here just to
18:25 - kind of give you the quick notes because
18:27 - i'm not going to go through all of the
18:28 - differences between them is that if you
18:29 - are buying a computer make sure if it
18:31 - has one drive it's an ssd it doesn't
18:34 - really matter what the ssd is any ssd is
18:37 - going to be relatively fast and if
18:38 - you're building your own computer you
18:40 - can do some research you need to make
18:41 - sure the ssd is going to be compatible
18:43 - and all of that type of stuff
18:44 - now if you're worried about the amount
18:46 - of capacity that is in your ssd maybe
18:48 - it's only 256 gigabytes and you think
18:51 - you're going to have more files than
18:52 - that that's fine still get the ssd
18:55 - load your operating system on the ssd
18:57 - load your main programs on the ssd
18:59 - anything that you want to run quickly
19:01 - then put all of your files things like
19:03 - videos photos whatever
19:05 - on the hard drive anything that you
19:07 - don't want to access a lot where that is
19:09 - kind of just sitting there it's
19:10 - literally just storage put it on a hard
19:12 - drive anything that you use frequently
19:14 - like applications programs put it on
19:17 - your ssd because when you want to load
19:19 - something you first need to read it from
19:21 - the ssd it then gets loaded in ram and
19:24 - then it starts running so if you're
19:25 - experiencing long load times check if
19:28 - your programs are on an ssd or a hard
19:30 - drive if it's on a hard drive that's
19:32 - probably the reason and if you have your
19:34 - operating system on a hard drive i feel
19:36 - very sorry for you because your load
19:37 - times are probably 10 times longer than
19:39 - they need to be if you had the operating
19:41 - system on an ssd now i could keep going
19:44 - here for hours but i do need to end the
19:46 - video here hopefully this was helpful
19:48 - and gave you kind of a decent
19:49 - introduction to computer components
19:51 - maybe got you thinking about some of the
19:52 - specs you haven't seen before helped you
19:54 - understand some different things and how
19:56 - they work i could keep going on about
19:58 - this for hours and hours and i'm sure i
20:00 - missed some important things in this
20:01 - video if you guys think i missed
20:03 - something please leave a comment down
20:04 - below i will try to address it if you
20:06 - want more videos on computer hardware
20:08 - then definitely let me know and i will
20:10 - make those in the future with that said
20:11 - make sure to check out

20:14 - tim if you want to learn to code and i
20:16 - will see you in another youtube video
