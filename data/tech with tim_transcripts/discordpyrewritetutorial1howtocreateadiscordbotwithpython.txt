00:00 - hey guys and welcome to the first
00:02 - discord rewrite tutorial on my channel
00:05 - just to make this clear really quickly
00:07 - discord rewrite is the new version of
00:09 - discord pie if you've heard of that so
00:12 - if you guys already have discord on PI
00:14 - installed please make sure you watch
00:15 - this entire video because installing
00:17 - discord rewrite is different and the
00:19 - syntax is different and that's we're
00:21 - gonna be using from now on so
00:23 - essentially what we're gonna be doing
00:24 - and what I'm gonna do in this tutorial
00:25 - is I'm first gonna show you the bots
00:27 - that we're gonna work to create and I'll
00:29 - do that in just a second once I get
00:30 - through kind of this intro stuff and
00:32 - then we're gonna be setting up our
00:33 - Python or environment our discord server
00:36 - so that we can connect a bot to that and
00:39 - then we can write some code for that
00:40 - BOTS and get interacting with users so
00:43 - near the end of the video we'll be
00:44 - writing a bit of code that'll only be
00:45 - like two or three minutes just to make
00:47 - sure everything's working do it the rest
00:48 - of the video we're gonna be setting
00:49 - everything up and it actually is quite a
00:51 - few steps to to set this up so please if
00:54 - you don't already have your environment
00:56 - set up and you don't have a discord bog
00:57 - connected please make sure you watched
00:59 - the entire video because I know I'm
01:00 - gonna get tons of questions asking why
01:02 - things didn't work and I'm gonna have to
01:03 - ask you if you watch the video and if
01:05 - you say no I'm just gonna direct you to
01:06 - watch it again so if you guys have any
01:08 - questions and you watched the entire
01:09 - thing you can obviously well contact me
01:12 - on discord on my discord server or you
01:15 - can leave a comment down below but I'm
01:16 - more likely to answer you if you want
01:18 - discord because I check that more often
01:20 - all right
01:21 - so I guess let's get started so
01:23 - essentially I'm gonna use pine charm and
01:25 - and econo to do this now if you already
01:27 - have it set up with IDL e which is just
01:29 - again like the default install that's
01:32 - fine you can use that the code is gonna
01:34 - be the exact same but for my purpose I'm
01:36 - going to use PI charm an anaconda so if
01:38 - you don't use that I'm not gonna promise
01:39 - that it's gonna work now obviously we
01:42 - need a discord server so I have my
01:44 - actual discord server and you can see I
01:46 - already have a bot kind of going in here
01:48 - so I'll show you quickly I'm actually
01:49 - just gonna run my bot I gotta open it up
01:52 - here I'll show you what it looks like
01:54 - when it's actually running and on the
01:56 - server so you guys kind of get an idea
01:57 - so just go with Python um YouTube and
02:02 - discord up I open that up and then we
02:05 - can just run our bots by just clicking
02:07 - this little run icon and now you should
02:08 - see that we have bought and it shows a
02:10 - little Tim bot that's online now
02:13 - I want to see a list of commands I do
02:15 - Tim god help and then it just goes
02:17 - through kind of all the commands as I've
02:18 - set up and you can obviously add more
02:19 - this is just me like messing around with
02:21 - it for an hour I can check my amount of
02:23 - messages and it's tim dot i underscore
02:29 - messages to see how many messages i've
02:31 - sent in the server since I've set the
02:33 - baud up so 33 if I want to see the top
02:35 - users on the server it should be me
02:37 - it'll just say who has the most amount
02:40 - of messages yeah so I have 34 messages
02:42 - and then we can be like the server stats
02:44 - so server stats like that and says users
02:48 - messages days recorded and then average
02:51 - messages per day and we are actually
02:53 - going to go through and probably like
02:54 - graph this information do some cool
02:56 - stuff with this so these are the
02:57 - commands they've set up I can do the
02:58 - member count I won't go through all of
03:00 - them but you guys kind of get the idea
03:00 - and I'm gonna be showing you how to do
03:02 - all of this and more in this tutorial
03:04 - series
03:05 - now I'm not gonna mess with this bot
03:07 - because I already got it working but I'm
03:09 - actually just gonna use a test server
03:10 - for this especially cuz I if you guys
03:12 - steal my like token and all that and I
03:15 - don't care if you mess up my test server
03:16 - but anyways if you don't have a server
03:18 - yet just go ahead and click this plus
03:20 - and click create a server and that's
03:22 - literally all eaten to do give it a name
03:23 - add like at least one text channel
03:25 - should come up with general and then we
03:27 - can actually get to working with a bawd
03:29 - here so now that we've done that what we
03:31 - gonna want to do actually is open up our
03:33 - discord developer portal now you can see
03:37 - here if you so all you have to do to do
03:39 - this is just go to just scored developer
03:41 - portal like that alright and then I'm
03:44 - just doing Stabila / slash or
03:46 - applications I'll leave the link in the
03:47 - description and all this will be up on
03:48 - my website tech with Tim done that you
03:50 - can go look at that as well all the code
03:52 - and everything and if you you shouldn't
03:53 - have anything here so you gonna sign in
03:55 - with your discord so what did I do
03:57 - yeah I've signed it with my discord so
03:59 - do that and then just click create new
04:01 - application like this now you can just
04:03 - give it a name I just named my test
04:05 - server and I already have it here so I'm
04:06 - not gonna do that but just create a new
04:08 - one if you haven't and then you can open
04:09 - this up and so it gives you your client
04:12 - ID and then you're gonna see this thing
04:14 - that says bought so for bought what
04:16 - we're gonna do is we're gonna create a
04:18 - new bot so it should say here I already
04:21 - have one it should say I can add a bot
04:22 - just click yes confirm that and then
04:25 - should give you a bot and I just named
04:27 - mine let's just name this okay that'll
04:29 - be the name of our bot number 4380 now
04:33 - it's gonna ask you to give some
04:34 - permission to this bot now you might not
04:36 - want to make it a minister but you want
04:38 - to make sure that it's able to at least
04:39 - send and see messages so let's do with
04:42 - view channels send messages maybe delete
04:45 - messages read message history mention
04:48 - out everyone and you can pick through
04:50 - which ones you want here but at least
04:52 - give it enough that it's gonna be able
04:53 - to send and look at messages because it
04:54 - needs to do that so we'll do that I'm
04:56 - Save Changes and then we're almost good
04:59 - to go on setting up kind of the discord
05:01 - this point of things so what we're gonna
05:03 - do now actually set up our environment
05:06 - now before I keep going I just want to
05:08 - say quickly this is actually a sponsored
05:10 - video people have Pro xbn they reached
05:14 - out to me and I said hey we're a VPN
05:15 - company and we want to give you and your
05:18 - viewers to discount so I'll actually
05:19 - have a 50% off code if you guys want to
05:21 - want to use this VPN it works on your
05:24 - phone it works on Mac it works on
05:25 - Windows and one account actually will
05:27 - work for everything so they gave me a
05:29 - free account and I've actually been
05:30 - using it for the past like two months I
05:31 - don't have it set up right now but on my
05:33 - Mac and my phone because I'm on
05:35 - university Wi-Fi and I want to make sure
05:36 - that all my stuff is like encrypted and
05:38 - like people can't look through all my
05:39 - information so I use Pro xbn to do that
05:42 - it's actually been like a pretty decent
05:44 - VPN considering a lot of the other ones
05:46 - so this one is 625 a month us but with
05:49 - my discount code you're able to get it
05:51 - for an what's half of that 360 something
05:54 - a month and that's like you don't it's
05:57 - not just the first month like every
05:58 - month you only pay that amount so for 3
06:00 - bucks to have your information secure
06:01 - and have access to all these features
06:03 - I'll let you guys read through it um go
06:05 - to the link in the description and just
06:06 - you know if you do actually purchase
06:07 - this you're supporting me because I get
06:09 - what do you call it like referral money
06:12 - if you uh if you use this so write this
06:14 - that's about that so we need to do now
06:16 - actually set up our environment so to do
06:18 - that we're gonna use anaconda this is
06:20 - just like a package manager in the
06:21 - conveyor it manager for Python you don't
06:23 - have to use this but again that's what
06:24 - I'm using for the tutorial just click
06:26 - downloads on anaconda again links will
06:28 - be in the description
06:29 - I'm just downloaded 3 7 version if
06:31 - you're on Windows Mac same thing I
06:33 - already have it downloaded but just go
06:34 - through that and it will ask you to add
06:36 - and
06:36 - kondeh two paths so make sure you select
06:39 - like add two paths when it does that and
06:41 - yes okay so now we got anaconda now what
06:44 - we need to do is set up a virtual
06:46 - environment with anaconda so what we're
06:48 - gonna do is going to go to CMD so our
06:50 - command prompt just drag this over here
06:52 - and just type Conda first of all so if
06:55 - you get something like this and this
06:56 - works you did everything correctly if
06:59 - this doesn't work
06:59 - make sure you add Conda to path so
07:02 - reinstall it and make sure you check
07:03 - that add to path button and if you know
07:05 - it added to the path manually you can do
07:07 - that okay so now we're going to do is
07:08 - gonna create a new environment so we
07:09 - gonna do Conda create - n and then we're
07:12 - gonna give this a name I'm just gonna
07:14 - call mine discord or actually I don't
07:16 - know if that's gonna work let's just I'm
07:18 - just gonna call mine uh let's see here
07:20 - tutorial okay for tutorial and then
07:23 - we're gonna have to do and this is
07:24 - important make sure you python equals
07:26 - three point six because the current
07:29 - version of Python three seven is not
07:30 - supported for discord rewrite so make
07:32 - sure you do Python equals three point
07:34 - six okay so we'll do that it's gonna go
07:36 - through solving the environment setting
07:38 - it up just click yes and then once
07:40 - that's done we're actually to install
07:42 - some packages into this environment and
07:43 - set it up into pycharm so I'll just wait
07:46 - one second once finishes okay so now
07:50 - that our environment is set up we're
07:51 - gonna have to do is actually activate it
07:52 - and we're going to install some packages
07:53 - into it so if you haven't used this
07:56 - before essentially all we're doing is
07:57 - creating a virtual environment to store
07:59 - a bunch of packages so that that way um
08:01 - what do you call it's we have everything
08:04 - kind of organized into this environment
08:05 - and we don't clutter our like main
08:07 - Python file and that's what an account
08:08 - is used for it's like a package manager
08:10 - and a virtual environment manager so I'm
08:12 - just gonna activate my environment so I
08:13 - just called this tutorial so you jump to
08:15 - you activate and then the name of your
08:16 - environment that you just created so
08:18 - we'll do that and you should see these
08:19 - little brackets popping up it's the left
08:21 - of your path okay now don't do what I'm
08:25 - about to do do not to do this if you do
08:27 - this is just gonna kind of be a headache
08:29 - okay so pip installed this way don't do
08:31 - that if you do that you're gonna install
08:33 - the old version of discord pi which does
08:36 - not have the same syntax as what I'm
08:37 - gonna be using so you're just gonna be
08:38 - all messed up and yeah so just don't do
08:41 - that we're actually gonna have to
08:42 - install this off of the github so
08:45 - essentially discord rewrite which is
08:46 - what we're using isn't it's not fully
08:49 - released yet so it's not
08:50 - like pip like you can't just you can't
08:52 - pip install it so so what we have to do
08:54 - is get it from github so we can select
08:56 - use pip but we have to just give a
08:58 - certain command so I have it in a
08:59 - notepad here we're just gonna grab it
09:01 - from the github so I'll put this link in
09:03 - the description again it'll be on my
09:04 - website as well in case I forget to put
09:06 - it on there and then all we're gonna do
09:08 - is just copy this in here and says pip
09:09 - install how do you get a decision it
09:12 - means we're getting it from github okay
09:14 - and then we're just gonna click enter
09:16 - enter there we go and it's gonna clone
09:19 - the repository and install that for us
09:22 - so once that's done we'll be back okay
09:24 - so we finished doing that so now I think
09:27 - that's actually about it that we need
09:28 - for our bots now if you guys want to go
09:30 - ahead and stir like numpy and pandas or
09:32 - some other module is you think you're
09:33 - gonna use you can do that now or you can
09:35 - always come back later you can activate
09:37 - your environment and then reinstall it
09:39 - into there so there's no rush you don't
09:40 - have to install all the packages now
09:41 - again this will be in the description
09:44 - okay all right so now we're done with
09:46 - our command prompt and now it's time to
09:48 - move to PyCharm
09:49 - okay so that's my bot I'm just gonna end
09:50 - this and you can see was actually
09:53 - logging like all the messages that it
09:54 - sent to you as well I'm just gonna close
09:56 - this project and just start fresh that
09:58 - I'm with you guys okay so we're gonna
10:00 - create a new project and I'm just gonna
10:02 - name this C Python will name this
10:05 - discord and then tutorial like that okay
10:09 - now for the project interpreter you can
10:12 - mess with it here if you want or you can
10:13 - just wait till after all just mess with
10:15 - it here what you gonna do is you're
10:17 - gonna go to existing interpreter
10:18 - you're gonna go to click these dot dot
10:20 - dots and we're going to find this Condit
10:22 - environment that we just created so you
10:23 - can select Kannada environment I'm going
10:25 - to go to instead of no interpreter we're
10:27 - gonna click these three dots we're gonna
10:29 - go to our C Drive we're going to go to
10:31 - users we're going to go to our user and
10:33 - then we're gonna go to anaconda three
10:35 - okay again you can look at the path up
10:38 - here if you're getting lost and where
10:39 - I'm typing but this is the default
10:40 - install location for anaconda if you
10:42 - installed it somewhere else then you're
10:43 - obviously gonna have to find where that
10:45 - is but mine is just and this is the
10:47 - default one and C Drive okay you know
10:48 - open and Akhanda and this should be the
10:50 - same no matter where your anaconda is
10:52 - you're gonna click env standing for
10:53 - environments and you're gonna find your
10:55 - environment so mines tutorial on but you
10:57 - can see my other environments here I
10:58 - have discord our disk new web tensor
11:01 - tensorflow for the machine
11:03 - learning stuff at it so we're going to
11:04 - put tutorial and then we're gonna go and
11:06 - we're gonna click Python W Exe and this
11:08 - is gonna be the interpreter that we use
11:10 - we'll click OK and now we have you can
11:12 - see three point six this should be
11:13 - popping up and you've now configured the
11:16 - interpreter so we're almost actually
11:17 - ready to go insert tightness of code so
11:19 - let's click create and now we're loaded
11:22 - up and let's just make a new Python file
11:25 - okay so I shut to restart my webcam
11:27 - quickly because whenever I launch
11:29 - pycharm it kind of glitches out but
11:30 - essentially all we messed here is we're
11:31 - just gonna go here and go new python
11:33 - file so I said that by right-clicking
11:35 - and just name it whatever you want I'm
11:37 - just gonna de menthe bought and there we
11:39 - go so now let's just quickly set up a
11:41 - configuration so we can run this fast
11:42 - and we'll add configuration plus Python
11:46 - and then we're just gonna do what do you
11:49 - call it
11:49 - let's call it BOTS and then we're just
11:52 - going to go to script path and we'll go
11:54 - to discord tutorial box okay make sure
11:58 - the correct environment so three six
12:00 - discord dump I think this is the right
12:04 - one maybe when we were using Python
12:08 - three six or is it yeah project default
12:11 - sorry Python three six that's when we
12:13 - want project default again you can setup
12:15 - your interpreter here if you know to do
12:16 - that but I'm pretty sure if you just do
12:18 - project default that should work at
12:19 - least we'll test that out in a second
12:20 - okay so now we're good with that and
12:22 - what we're gonna do is we're just gonna
12:23 - import discord here and make sure that
12:27 - this is working so essentially I forgot
12:29 - to mention this but if you guys don't
12:30 - have this it just just called PI tram
12:32 - right it's it's like one of the best
12:34 - like what do you call it ID east for
12:36 - Python you can really just type PyCharm
12:38 - on the internet go here and download it
12:41 - there's not really anything you have to
12:42 - do to set it up I just pick like an
12:44 - install location and click download and
12:46 - then all you're gonna do is launch it
12:48 - again like you can just type I charm to
12:50 - launch that and just follow along with
12:51 - the steps that I showed you sorry I
12:53 - always forget that people don't use
12:55 - PyCharm because I always use it but
12:57 - anyways so now I'm just gonna run this
12:59 - configuration by clicking this little
13:00 - arrow up here and what I did essentially
13:01 - if you're confused was I just created a
13:03 - new way to run my file because I'm
13:05 - PyCharm you need to use configurations
13:06 - if you guys want PyCharm tutorials how
13:08 - to use this thing it's pretty useful I
13:10 - have some of my channel that you can
13:11 - check out as well
13:12 - but we'll just click this run icon and
13:14 - no errors so we're
13:16 - actually good okay so we've imported
13:17 - discord okay so now what I'm gonna do is
13:20 - I'm just gonna create a new text file in
13:23 - here so I'm just gonna call this
13:24 - actually token dot txt because what I'm
13:28 - about to do is get the token for my BOTS
13:30 - now I don't want to give you guys my
13:32 - token because if I give it to you then
13:33 - you're gonna be able to code with my
13:35 - bought and well mess with it so
13:37 - essentially to get your token what
13:38 - you're gonna do is go back to this
13:39 - developer portal I hope you didn't close
13:41 - it yet and you're just gonna click on
13:43 - click to reveal token now I'm gonna do
13:46 - this off-camera but essentially gonna
13:48 - click on this okay and then just make
13:50 - sure you have the token you don't have
13:52 - to put it in a text file because you'll
13:53 - see what we're gonna do with it just
13:55 - like copy just copy it in here okay just
13:57 - copy like whatever the token is it's
13:58 - gonna be a bunch of letters and copy it
14:00 - into your file just so you have it okay
14:01 - so I'm gonna pause quickly do that and
14:04 - then I'll be back okay so I'm back so
14:06 - all I've done essentially is copied my
14:07 - token into this token dot txt file
14:10 - I believe I saved that and then all I'm
14:12 - doing is I just made this function
14:13 - that's just gonna read the token in
14:15 - again you guys don't have to do this
14:16 - you'll see what I'm gonna do in just a
14:17 - second okay so essentially what we need
14:19 - to do now is we need to just set up a
14:20 - client for discord so this is um the
14:23 - beginning steps are just gonna say
14:25 - client equals discord dot clients like
14:28 - okay and we'll put brackets and now we
14:31 - need to do is we need to run our client
14:33 - now this is where we need the token
14:34 - right so from that developer page we got
14:37 - the token and what this is gonna do is
14:38 - gonna connect us with our bot okay
14:41 - and since our bot is we have two out so
14:44 - associate that bot with the server so
14:46 - we'll do that in just a second but
14:48 - essentially we're gonna do is we're
14:49 - gonna do client dot run okay and then
14:52 - here we're gonna put our token so in
14:54 - this case my token is well token alright
14:56 - so actually I think I better close this
14:58 - I didn't need to do this so let's go
14:59 - back to the discord developer portal
15:01 - quickly I know what a test server okay
15:03 - so to link this up I was trying to find
15:05 - like the easiest way to do this but
15:07 - essentially we just need this client ID
15:09 - okay now what you guys gonna have to do
15:11 - is I have a link in the description
15:12 - alright and you're just gonna copy that
15:15 - link now the link is going to look I
15:17 - have it in a text file just so I can
15:19 - show you exactly what it looks like but
15:20 - essentially it is this okay so it's
15:23 - gonna look like this
15:24 - this is what the link is now notice that
15:26 - it says here C which says bought client
15:28 - ID and
15:29 - like the greater than sign lesson sign
15:31 - like encapsulating this you're gonna
15:33 - delete this okay from the link so you're
15:36 - gonna copy into a text file what are you
15:37 - gonna do and then delete that what we're
15:39 - gonna do is you're gonna paste your
15:41 - client ID here now the client ID is this
15:45 - right
15:46 - you're gonna copy that so we'll copy it
15:48 - we'll go to the text file and this is
15:50 - exactly what you need to do paste it
15:52 - right there so you notice that it's not
15:54 - late it's not in between the the we put
15:56 - the tag it's just like ID equals and
15:59 - then you're gonna take this link okay so
16:02 - it's a web link we'll copy it now we're
16:05 - gonna put it up here and I already did
16:07 - it here but I'll just I'll paste it when
16:08 - we're trying to show you so ctrl V click
16:11 - enter it's gonna load up a page that
16:13 - looks like this now it's gonna say add a
16:15 - bot to a server so what I'm gonna do is
16:17 - we're gonna select test server like that
16:19 - okay and I'm gonna click authorize all
16:21 - right so now because you were signing
16:24 - with your Dischord right when you did
16:25 - this it's gonna allow you to add that to
16:27 - your server so you're gonna click I'm
16:28 - not a robot go through all these these
16:30 - steps and then you can see about us here
16:32 - and it's letting me know that in the the
16:35 - text channel okay so if I go to discord
16:37 - and open this back up then you could see
16:40 - now we have an offline bought now if
16:42 - you're not getting this offline bought
16:44 - you are you made a mistake is it should
16:47 - be showing up in offline okay now what
16:51 - I'm gonna do actually so I'm gonna close
16:52 - this but I remember these links are in
16:54 - the description and you just have to
16:55 - replace that with the client ID that
16:57 - you're getting from your discord
16:58 - developer portal I know this is a lot of
16:59 - work but it's authorized so I can
17:01 - actually go ahead and I can close this
17:03 - because we don't need that anymore now
17:04 - the bots added all we need to do is just
17:06 - run it so we have the bot token right
17:09 - and the bot token I'm storing the token
17:10 - dot txt file but you guys gonna have it
17:12 - in here now just to show you here if you
17:15 - don't have the token in a string like
17:16 - say it's like token token here just put
17:19 - quotation marks around it because it's
17:21 - not gonna work if you just have like a
17:22 - bunch of letters and numbers Python
17:24 - doesn't know what to do with that so if
17:26 - your tokens here and it's like not from
17:27 - a text file then just put it like that
17:29 - so it comes in as a string okay just to
17:31 - make sure in because I'm sure someone's
17:32 - probably make the mistake alright so now
17:34 - what we're gonna do is we run this and
17:36 - see if everything's actually working so
17:38 - I'm gonna run my bought because we're
17:39 - client dot run right now I'm gonna go to
17:41 - my discord server you should
17:43 - see the bot is online if you've got to
17:45 - this point you've done everything
17:47 - successful congratulations we're almost
17:49 - ready to start like seeing if the bots
17:51 - can get our messages or not okay so now
17:53 - the bot is online so just to show you
17:56 - this is old this mod is only going to be
17:58 - online when you're running the the
18:00 - script so if you are like hosting a bot
18:02 - for example on your computer it's only
18:04 - gonna be online when first of all your
18:06 - computer's on and second of all you're
18:07 - running that BOTS script on your
18:08 - computer so show in later videos how we
18:10 - can host our bot using like like web
18:13 - services like Amazon Web Services and
18:14 - stuff so we don't have to constantly
18:15 - have it running on our computer but for
18:17 - now that's what we're gonna do
18:18 - especially for testing so now notice if
18:20 - I stop this script I go back here just
18:22 - wait a second it should go offline I
18:24 - think it just takes a second let's see
18:27 - here if I change servers and go back
18:29 - okay well it's gonna go offline in a
18:31 - second just just trust me on that okay
18:32 - okay so now we've got our token that we
18:35 - ran the bot everything seems to be
18:36 - working so what we're gonna do now is
18:38 - we're gonna try to get a message from
18:39 - the user and just like print that
18:42 - message back so this all can go actually
18:45 - we're gonna go in between these two
18:47 - lines is we're gonna run after and what
18:49 - we're gonna do is we're gonna set up
18:50 - events now this kind of system works on
18:52 - a bents so I'm gonna do at client dot
18:55 - event
18:56 - okay and there's a reason that's why I
18:58 - need this client here so that this is
18:59 - gonna work and is there brackets no
19:00 - there's not so let's do a client event
19:02 - and then what we're gonna do is we're
19:04 - gonna state define on underscore message
19:07 - okay and then in here we're just got a
19:10 - type message because what's essentially
19:12 - gonna happen is whenever a message is
19:14 - sent this function is gonna be run so by
19:17 - putting this what's known as a decorator
19:18 - here it's saying that when the event of
19:21 - on message is triggered this function
19:24 - runs so then we're gonna grab the
19:25 - message from the user and then we can
19:27 - start doing things with it now I don't
19:28 - think I can actually do define I have to
19:30 - do like a sink or something let's have a
19:33 - look here a sink define but it should
19:37 - help stop working yeah a sink define so
19:39 - you need this async thing I'm not gonna
19:42 - go through exactly what that does but
19:43 - this way you need to do a sink define on
19:44 - message message and now whenever a
19:46 - message is sent this function is gonna
19:48 - run so how do we get the message how do
19:51 - we check how do we send messages oh
19:52 - there's a lot of stuff so essentially
19:54 - what we're gonna do first of all is
19:55 - let's just print to our actual con
19:57 - so what the message is and make sure
19:59 - that this is working so we'll say
20:00 - message dot content and I believe that's
20:04 - what it is message dot content yes miss
20:07 - check message I got that I'm just
20:08 - looking at the documentation right now
20:09 - so I don't forget okay so I'm gonna
20:11 - click run and now let's test and see if
20:14 - we're getting messages okay so we
20:16 - running this no errors let's go to our
20:17 - discord server I'll make it smaller and
20:20 - then let's just say hi now look at my
20:24 - console to the left here it's printing
20:26 - out exactly what I'm typing hello what's
20:29 - up Tim okay so we're getting those
20:32 - messages so we know that this is working
20:34 - the bot is working that's awesome okay
20:37 - so we're getting messages so now what we
20:39 - want to do is we want to check what
20:40 - these messages are and based on that we
20:42 - want to send messages back to the user
20:43 - after I do this I'm going to end this
20:45 - tutorial but I just want to show you so
20:46 - you guys can mess around with it at
20:48 - least a little bit so what do we do now
20:49 - who say if message content don't find
20:54 - okay and what I'm going to do is I'm
20:56 - just gonna do like an exclamation point
20:57 - and then hello so all I'm gonna do
20:59 - essentially is say if we find this so if
21:01 - this is greater than or if it's not
21:06 - equal to negative one because the way
21:07 - find is gonna work its gonna find to get
21:09 - negative one if it doesn't find this
21:10 - we're just see if dot or exclamation
21:13 - point hello is in the message if it is
21:15 - we're gonna say hi back so how do we do
21:17 - this well to say hi back we're actually
21:19 - undo a weight message dot channel dot
21:24 - send and then in here we'll just say hi
21:28 - now we double check this but I think
21:30 - that is correct message to channel don't
21:32 - send yes so what we're doing now is
21:35 - we're checking that if this exclamation
21:37 - point hello is contained anywhere in the
21:39 - message okay we're choosing a really
21:40 - basic Python find function and do this
21:42 - now find returns a negative one if it
21:44 - doesn't find it so if it finds it at any
21:46 - point then it's not gonna be negative
21:47 - one so we'll say hi back so let's now
21:50 - end the ball and run it again let's go
21:53 - to discord which apparently I keep
21:54 - closing and then let's just type let's
21:57 - type hi and see it's not printing
21:59 - anything out nothing's happening but now
22:01 - if I type exclamation point below our
22:03 - bot responds and it says hi so that's
22:05 - all I'm going to show you guys for today
22:07 - if you had any trouble with this again
