00:00 - in this video we're gonna be going over
00:02 - if-else and L if statements in Java so
00:05 - quickly just I want to fix a really
00:07 - small mistake I'm in the last video so
00:09 - if you guys don't know I am like a
00:10 - Python programmer typically so I'm doing
00:13 - Java obviously but Python is like my
00:15 - first language so I'm used to being able
00:16 - to use two equal signs on pretty much
00:18 - anything because that's what you can do
00:19 - in Python but in the last video I showed
00:21 - you using two equal signs on strings now
00:23 - that's not incorrect to do that but it's
00:26 - not gonna work the way you think right
00:28 - now so if you want to compare if two
00:29 - strings are logically the same like the
00:32 - actual string values are the same way
00:34 - you should actually do is say you have a
00:35 - string so s in this case you have to do
00:38 - dot equals okay and then inside of this
00:40 - equals here you're gonna put the string
00:42 - that you want to compare it to or you're
00:43 - gonna put another variable which is a
00:45 - string so in this case if I want to say
00:46 - if like my scanner objects which I've
00:48 - just typed out before this video is
00:50 - equal to hello this is how I would do it
00:52 - with this dot equal sign not the two
00:55 - equal signs you the two equal signs
00:57 - isn't wrong but it's gonna give you a
00:58 - different answer and we will talk about
01:01 - that in future videos but it's too
01:02 - advanced to go into right now so just
01:03 - remember if you want to compare two
01:05 - strings use dot equals my apologies
01:07 - about that from the last video so what
01:09 - we want to do now is when we do it using
01:11 - if and else statements so pretty much if
01:13 - something happens do this otherwise do
01:17 - this and this is the basis of
01:20 - programming using conditions based on
01:22 - like user input or based on certain
01:24 - events that happen we're gonna do
01:25 - different things right so they're really
01:27 - important to understand so first of all
01:29 - what I'm doing here is I'm just getting
01:31 - I'm just setting up a new scanner object
01:32 - I'm just gonna get you input from the
01:34 - user we've already talked about this and
01:35 - what I want to do is I want to check
01:37 - that users input and based on what they
01:40 - type in I want to do something so the
01:42 - basic syntax are if and else is in Java
01:44 - is you simply type if you put brackets
01:46 - and inside of these brackets is going to
01:49 - be your condition and this is why I
01:50 - spend so much time talking about
01:51 - conditions in the last video the
01:53 - condition here is if this condition
01:55 - evaluates to true whatever's inside of
01:57 - what I'm going to show you here
01:58 - whatever's inside of these curly braces
02:00 - is gonna happen so let's start with the
02:02 - condition let's say if s dot equals not
02:06 - to equal signs and in this case I'm
02:08 - going to say Tim so if the user types in
02:11 - Tim when we're when we
02:13 - prompt them for input then I want to do
02:16 - something and what's gonna happen is
02:17 - inside of these curly braces and this
02:19 - denotes a block so this is known as like
02:22 - an if statement or an if block so this
02:24 - block simply goes the syntax if then we
02:27 - have this these brackets inside the
02:30 - brackets as a condition the condition
02:31 - can be as long as it wants as long as
02:33 - you want as long as you're going to get
02:35 - a true or false value back from it and
02:36 - then we have these curly braces so an
02:38 - open brace and a close brace and inside
02:41 - of these braces anything that I type in
02:43 - here is going to happen if this
02:45 - condition is true so let's just do a
02:47 - quick little test here in order to do
02:49 - system dot out dot println and in this
02:52 - case we'll just say you typed ten okay
02:56 - Wow
02:57 - types you types you typed Tim okay and
03:00 - let's run the program and see what
03:02 - happened so when I run this if it loads
03:06 - up that's odd
03:07 - okay mmm give me one second okay so
03:10 - we're back I accidentally closed my
03:12 - console and yeah we were running into
03:14 - some issues with that so I got that up
03:15 - and running now let me just restart this
03:18 - quickly
03:19 - okay Wow okay I don't know why that's
03:21 - white but anyways uh let's just type out
03:24 - what are we gonna say here let's type
03:26 - hello and see what we get
03:27 - well we get nothing because we didn't
03:30 - type Tim so let's run it again let's try
03:32 - it this time I type Tim and it says you
03:35 - typed Tim so there we go our basic if
03:37 - statement is working now I want you to
03:40 - put another system dot out over here so
03:45 - that we can see what happens when we
03:48 - have like just with this example guy I'm
03:50 - just going to print I'm literally gonna
03:52 - print print okay so now what I want to
03:55 - show what happens here is like what is
03:58 - the program gonna run so if we type Tim
04:01 - we're gonna get this you typed him but
04:03 - are we still gonna get this print out
04:05 - here are we not gonna get it well let's
04:07 - test this out and see okay so in this
04:08 - case I typed Tim so when I typed him it
04:10 - says you typed him and then it says
04:11 - print okay now the reason that happens
04:14 - is because this print is not within this
04:16 - if block right so we're just gonna
04:18 - execute simply after this if block
04:20 - happens so now same thing right if I
04:21 - type like hi it's still gonna print out
04:25 - print to the screen
04:27 - because right it didn't go through this
04:28 - if block but this is not inside of the
04:30 - if block or the if statement or whatever
04:32 - so that executes okay so that's pretty
04:35 - straightforward now I'm going to show
04:36 - you else and LCIF
04:38 - rest start with notes so else is very
04:41 - straightforward it can only come after
04:44 - an else--if or and if so like the start
04:47 - of the block has to be if and then this
04:49 - else you can't just have it like a loan
04:51 - it has to come after an if statement or
04:53 - an else if statement which we're gonna
04:55 - go into in a second okay there's
04:57 - different ways to format this some
04:58 - people like to put the else like this so
05:00 - it has the closing brace and then the
05:02 - open brace I personally like to do it
05:03 - like this some people like to do it like
05:06 - this it's however you want okay this
05:08 - just works fine just make sure that your
05:10 - curly brace doesn't look something like
05:12 - that all the way out there because
05:13 - that's kind of hard to read okay so what
05:15 - I'm gonna do now is I'm going to put
05:16 - this print statement and I'm going to
05:18 - put it in my else statement alright
05:20 - now the way this else works is if this
05:23 - happens that's fine we're gonna go in
05:25 - here we're gonna print this out and then
05:27 - we'll move down to the end of the the
05:29 - block so we'll go to here as our next
05:32 - execution line now if this doesn't
05:34 - happen so other words or else
05:37 - then we print this so we're either
05:39 - printing you type Tim or print we're
05:41 - never printing both because one of them
05:43 - is if and one of them is else alright
05:45 - so let's test this out if I type Tim we
05:48 - you type Tim okay if I type anything
05:50 - else so like some random letters and I
05:52 - hit enter you get print so as else works
05:55 - is it's meant to do something if this
05:57 - condition is not true right okay so
05:59 - that's pretty straightforward I don't
06:00 - think I need to talk about that anymore
06:01 - the next one I'm gonna show you is else
06:03 - if now this is a way that we can add
06:06 - multiple if conditions in one kind of
06:08 - block okay so what I can do now is I can
06:11 - do like else if and now it's the exact
06:14 - same syntax as regular if statement
06:18 - except you just have this else before
06:20 - and obviously since this is an else it
06:23 - has to come after an initial if
06:25 - statement so you can have as many of
06:27 - these else ifs as you want now first
06:30 - I'll just put a condition in here so say
06:31 - s dodge equals and in this case let's
06:36 - just say hey like hello okay
06:38 - and then here we'll just do it system
06:40 - dot out dot println and we'll just say
06:44 - hi because we want to greet them back
06:46 - they said hello okay so again the way
06:49 - this is gonna work is we're gonna go
06:50 - through we're gonna check we're gonna
06:52 - get our scanner input we get s say okay
06:54 - what's s is s equal to Tim if it is
06:57 - we're gonna print this and then we're
06:59 - gonna move down after the last else
07:01 - statement we're not gonna even bother
07:02 - checking if it's something else because
07:04 - if it's equal to Tim then we know that
07:06 - we shouldn't bother looking at the else
07:08 - ifs right now if it's not equal to Tim
07:11 - what we're gonna do is we're gonna go
07:13 - through and we're gonna check we're
07:13 - gonna say okay else if that's our next
07:15 - block is it equal to hello if it's equal
07:18 - to hello we're gonna print hi we're
07:20 - gonna move on with our lives are gonna
07:21 - move down here we're not even gonna
07:22 - bother go into the else okay now if it's
07:25 - not equal to hello we're gonna go into
07:27 - the else statement and we're just simply
07:28 - gonna print print there's no condition
07:30 - it's just automatically gonna happen if
07:32 - you print anything other than hello or
07:33 - Tim we're going to print print okay so
07:36 - let's try this out and let's type hello
07:39 - and you can see we get hi
07:42 - all right now if I print type anything
07:44 - else in here so like some random letters
07:46 - we get print okay and that is how that
07:50 - works now I can show you I can add as
07:52 - many else ifs as I want so if I copy
07:54 - this and I simply paste it down here I
07:57 - can have another else--if and in here I
07:59 - could have hi and then here I could type
08:01 - hello and we could keep going and we
08:04 - could do as many else ifs as we want
08:05 - just know that whenever you have kind of
08:07 - a block that looks like this it has to
08:09 - start with an if statement and it does
08:11 - actually doesn't have to end with an
08:13 - else
08:13 - so in else just is should be the last
08:16 - thing so if you have any else ifs else
08:18 - will be your last thing like I couldn't
08:20 - do an Elif here and then try typing like
08:22 - that's that's not okay you can't do that
08:25 - but if I omit this else that's perfectly
08:28 - fine so now I have if we type Tim we
08:30 - type below or we type hi let's run this
08:32 - and let's type none of them let's let's
08:34 - type a bunch of letters we get nothing
08:36 - printed to the screen because we don't
08:37 - have that else statement now if I type
08:39 - hi you see we get hello because right we
08:43 - went through it wasn't equal to Tim it
08:44 - wasn't equal to hello so we printed hi
08:46 - now I want to show you this this is a
08:49 - bad example but it'll work if I put
08:52 - here and I put hello here which one are
08:55 - we gonna print so remember we're only
08:57 - gonna print one of these things we're
08:58 - not gonna print more than one so which
09:00 - one is it is it high or is it hello well
09:03 - let's test it out if I type hello in
09:07 - here we print high now the reason we're
09:10 - printing high is because this else--if
09:11 - is above this one and this is the first
09:14 - one that's gonna be looked at when we
09:15 - type something in just the way I kind of
09:17 - went through it's Akatsuki Lee so since
09:20 - we print high here we'll be like okay
09:22 - well that happens so there's no point in
09:24 - checking this and we just move on okay
09:26 - straightforward now again I can do more
09:28 - if statements down here you could keep
09:30 - typing like do a bunch of stuff just
09:32 - understand you can have as many else ifs
09:34 - as you want
09:34 - you don't need an else--if like we could
09:36 - just do an if and then else but every
09:38 - time you have kind of like an if
09:39 - statement or block starting it has to
09:41 - start with an if it can have as many
09:43 - Alice's as you want and the last thing
09:45 - has to be in else if you're adding the
09:48 - else you don't have to have that else
09:49 - there so anyways I think that's all I'm
09:52 - gonna show for if statements else ifs
09:54 - and else they're pretty straightforward
09:56 - any condition can go here so anything
09:58 - that I showed you before like you could
09:59 - have a really long chain conditional
10:02 - with ton of stuff same thing here you
10:04 - could have any condition like it doesn't
10:06 - matter anything that gives you a true or
10:07 - false value
10:07 - you could also literally just type true
10:09 - and like that would always happen okay
10:11 - so anyways that's been it for this video
