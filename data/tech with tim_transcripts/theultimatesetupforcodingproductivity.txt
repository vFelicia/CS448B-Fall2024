00:00 - welcome and prepare to be amazed as I
00:02 - show you a setup that I've been building
00:04 - and iterating on for the past five years
00:06 - now this is the ultimate setup for
00:08 - programming gaming and of course content
00:11 - Creation in fact I actually have three
00:14 - setups the first setup is an M1 Mac Mini
00:16 - the second one is an absolutely Overkill
00:19 - PC and the last one is a docking station
00:22 - for my MacBook Pro now if you're
00:24 - wondering why I need three different
00:25 - setups then stick around until the end
00:27 - of the video where I talk to you about
00:28 - their use cases and show you all of the
00:30 - super high-end Tech that I'm using in
00:32 - each setup with that said let's dive
00:34 - into the two
00:36 - [Music]
00:39 - [Applause]
00:41 - [Music]
00:49 - so for any setup you need a good room
00:51 - now the room that I'm using is a spare
00:53 - bedroom in my house fortunately I own
00:55 - this house so I can do any
00:56 - customizations that I like now what I've
00:59 - done is added some custom sound proofing
01:00 - here on each of the walls as well as the
01:02 - ceiling just to give it a nice dead
01:04 - sound and make it super quiet when I'm
01:06 - recording I've also got a nice window
01:08 - here to let in some natural light and I
01:10 - have a shade on that window so I can
01:11 - pull that down and of course kind of
01:12 - make it a full blackout scene throughout
01:15 - the room I'm using different Hue Lights
01:16 - this allows me to kind of set the scene
01:18 - and set the different color profile when
01:20 - I'm doing a recording or when I'm doing
01:22 - something like gaming so now on to the
01:24 - desks obviously I have a large L desk
01:26 - which is made up of two countertops both
01:28 - that are from Ikea now I also have some
01:31 - drawers that are from Ikea this is a
01:32 - very popular setup quite a few people
01:34 - buy it and it's relatively inexpensive
01:36 - especially if you're going for a desk
01:38 - kind of the size that I have here now I
01:40 - like having a nice deep desk so that I
01:42 - can have a ton of stuff on it and I'm
01:44 - not kind of crammed or feel like my
01:45 - monitors are too close to my face now
01:47 - beyond that you can see my main setup is
01:49 - those three monitors this is where I
01:51 - spend about eighty percent of my time
01:53 - and this is connected to my Windows
01:55 - machine where I'm doing gaming editing
01:57 - programming all kinds of stuff really
01:59 - most of my work is done in this area
02:01 - then to the left of that I have my M1
02:04 - Mac Mini setup and this is solely used
02:06 - for recording audio literally all I do
02:08 - on that computer is run logic pro I have
02:11 - some filters set up in there and that's
02:12 - what records the audio that you're
02:14 - hearing right now moving on to my right
02:16 - side we have another setup this is a
02:18 - docking station for my MacBook Pro now
02:20 - the reason I need this is I do a lot of
02:22 - iOS development it's not super fast on
02:24 - the M1 Mac Mini so instead I use my
02:26 - MacBook Pro and that's where I kind of
02:28 - use xcode I'll go in and do iOS specific
02:31 - Dev connect my phone to the computer
02:33 - Etc so I just made a second setup over
02:35 - there so I have one Mac side and one
02:37 - Windows side and that is actually using
02:39 - a standing desk that can go up and down
02:40 - sometimes if I'm building computers I'll
02:42 - clear that desk off and put it on there
02:44 - I like to stand up when I'm doing all of
02:46 - those builds so next I guess I'll
02:48 - quickly mention to you my chair there so
02:49 - I am using a Herman Miller Aeron chair
02:51 - this is the classic version I got this a
02:54 - long time ago it's been holding up
02:55 - completely fine now even though this is
02:57 - an extremely expensive chair I would
02:59 - definitely recommend it to anyone who's
03:01 - sitting down for a long period of time
03:02 - it is pretty much reformed my back
03:05 - completely changed my posture and I know
03:07 - that this is a worthwhile investment so
03:09 - I think the new ones are going for
03:10 - almost fifteen hundred dollars but a
03:12 - share of this caliber is definitely
03:14 - something that you should consider
03:15 - especially if you're going to be moving
03:17 - into a software engineering career where
03:18 - you're going to be sitting 8 10 12 hours
03:20 - every single day alright so now let's
03:22 - dive into some computer specs so the
03:25 - first computer I'll start with is my
03:26 - main computer this is the one that I
03:28 - built myself now in this computer I'm
03:30 - using a ryzen 9 3900x I have 64
03:33 - gigabytes of RAM I'm using a 4090 and
03:36 - then I have dual Elgato 4K capture cards
03:39 - which actually capture the video from
03:41 - both of my professional cameras beyond
03:43 - that I have four terabytes of nvme SSD
03:46 - storage that's typically used for a
03:48 - scratch disk when I'm recording or for
03:50 - games applications
03:52 - Etc and if you're wondering where I
03:53 - store all of my videos actually have a
03:55 - home file server which I'll talk to you
03:57 - about later in this video regardless
03:59 - let's move on to my M1 Mac Mini this is
04:01 - a pretty standard configuration has the
04:03 - M1 chip I just upgraded to have 16
04:06 - gigabytes of RAM so it can handle some
04:08 - larger audio recordings and that's
04:10 - pretty much it next we have my MacBook
04:12 - Pro now this is a 16 inch MacBook Pro
04:15 - from 2019 I believe it has an i7 in it
04:17 - 16 gigs of RAM a basic GPU nothing
04:20 - insane but it is a fairly powerful
04:22 - laptop now I actually have a few other
04:24 - machines tucked away that I don't use
04:26 - too often one of them that you might
04:27 - find interesting is the Asus Rog is a
04:30 - forest Duo 15 absolutely ridiculous name
04:32 - regardless of say dual screen laptop I
04:35 - got as a part of a sponsorship that has
04:37 - a 2080 and I9 64 gigs of RAM 2 terabytes
04:41 - of storage absolutely Beast laptop but
04:43 - it has about 45 minutes of battery life
04:45 - when you're actually using all of those
04:46 - components lastly I do have an i iPad
04:49 - this iPad is what I use if I'm doing any
04:51 - kind of whiteboarding style questions or
04:53 - trying to explain something with like a
04:55 - pen and pencil alright so now that you
04:56 - know my main machines let's talk about
04:58 - how I view my main machines so my
05:00 - monitors now you may have noticed that
05:02 - every single monitor I have in this room
05:04 - is actually from BenQ now I've been
05:06 - primarily using BenQ monitors for the
05:08 - past five years or so just because I
05:10 - really prefer the colors that they have
05:12 - and the different features that are on
05:13 - the monitors however recently BenQ
05:16 - actually hooked me up with entirely new
05:18 - monitors replacing every single monitor
05:20 - I have in this office so now they are
05:22 - the official monitor company for Tech
05:24 - with Tim regardless let me go through
05:26 - the different monitors that I have it
05:28 - could be a little confusing with the
05:29 - model numbers but I'll link everything
05:30 - in the description in case you want to
05:32 - check it out yourself alright so let's
05:33 - begin with my main setup here the
05:35 - primary monitor that I have in the
05:37 - middle is the BenQ
05:39 - ex2710u which is a 27 inch 4K 144 Hertz
05:44 - display I have this because I like to
05:46 - game on my kind of main monitor so
05:48 - that's why I went with something it was
05:49 - so high end here beyond that both my
05:51 - vertical monitors are the same they are
05:53 - both 27 inches and they are the PD
05:56 - 2705u they are also 4K but they're just
05:59 - 60 hertz because I don't need a high
06:00 - refresh rate display for my secondary
06:02 - monitors now for my Mac Mini I have a PD
06:06 - 3420q this is a 34 inch 4K Ultra wide
06:09 - monitor that looks amazing now although
06:12 - I can honestly say that I do recommend
06:14 - these monitors I love them they look
06:15 - great if I didn't love them I'd swap
06:17 - them out they're definitely not budget
06:19 - friendly or a great option if you're
06:21 - just doing some basic coding these are
06:23 - really for someone like myself who's
06:24 - doing content creation gaming Etc so if
06:27 - you're someone who's just getting into
06:29 - coding then you'll probably like the
06:30 - other monitors that I have in my MacBook
06:32 - Pro setup so in that setup I'm using two
06:36 - gw2785 TC monitors again I'll link these
06:40 - in the description now I'm using the 27
06:42 - inch version of these monitors but they
06:44 - also come in 24 inches and they actually
06:46 - have a coding mode and are specifically
06:48 - designed designed for programmers now
06:50 - this mode works fantastic it makes a
06:52 - little bit easier to read your code
06:53 - gives you some better contrast and these
06:56 - monitors being 1080P and 60 hertz are a
06:58 - much more budget-friendly option and
07:00 - they also come with some of benq's
07:02 - Technology like the iCare technology now
07:04 - what this will do is automatically
07:06 - adjust the brightness of your screen
07:07 - based on the ambient lighting and this
07:10 - is something that's a little bit
07:10 - underrated and you might not notice a
07:12 - ton unless you don't have it so for me
07:14 - since I've been using BenQ monitors
07:16 - forever I'm so used to it doing this and
07:18 - it really does have a massive effect on
07:20 - the strain of your eyes when you're able
07:22 - to dynamically adjust that brightness
07:23 - without having to go in and constantly
07:25 - kind of tap on all of those features now
07:27 - the monitor comes with a ton of other
07:28 - features it has a mic it has speakers I
07:30 - don't know if you guys care about that
07:32 - obviously you can adjust it you can move
07:33 - it up and down Etc the reality is it's
07:35 - just a great entry level option for any
07:37 - of you that are looking for a secondary
07:39 - display and you can kind of do something
07:40 - like what I did here where you set up
07:42 - either vertical monitor or kind of two
07:43 - of these monitors here and connect
07:45 - something to a docking station it's just
07:47 - going to be a more pleasant experience
07:48 - when you're are working at home and not
07:50 - from some remote location alright so now
07:52 - let's move on and talk about some
07:53 - peripherals specifically my keyboard and
07:56 - mouse so for both my M1 Mac Mini and my
07:59 - main PC I use the exact same keyboard
08:01 - This is the hyperx alloy Origins with
08:03 - cherry Blue switches now these are super
08:06 - loud switches but these are the ones
08:07 - that I prefer and even though this
08:09 - keyboard isn't super high end I actually
08:11 - prefer it over a lot of the super way
08:13 - more expensive versions I think it's
08:15 - only like 100 bucks but it's been one of
08:17 - my favorite keyboards for about the past
08:18 - two years now for my Mac Pro setup I
08:21 - actually have a keychron K1 that's just
08:24 - a more compact keyboard I wanted to try
08:26 - one of those out it's not my favorite
08:27 - but it works for that setup okay so
08:30 - moving on to my mouse so all three of
08:32 - the mice that I use are Logitech MX
08:34 - Master mice I actually have two of the
08:36 - V3 ones and then one of the V1 if you're
08:39 - not sure they have like B1 B2 V3 I think
08:41 - that might be up to V4 now of this
08:43 - Logitech MX Master super popular Mouse
08:45 - it is really expensive almost the same
08:47 - price as my keyboard however definitely
08:50 - worth it and something I can highly
08:51 - recommend so continuing let's have a
08:53 - look at some different peripherals so I
08:55 - always like to listen to music when I'm
08:57 - coding or really doing any kind of work
08:59 - at all but I hate wearing headphones so
09:01 - that's why I invested in these kef LSX
09:04 - speakers which sound fantastic and
09:06 - connect to my audient ID 14 audio
09:08 - interface now this is a bit of a higher
09:10 - end audio interface that has some better
09:12 - preamps and this is what handles my mic
09:14 - input to my computer as well as routing
09:17 - the different audio between something
09:18 - like headphones if I have those plugged
09:19 - in or my speakers now this might be kind
09:22 - of a small touch or a small note here
09:24 - but I personally love having physical
09:26 - buttons on my desk for controlling the
09:28 - volume muting the mic doing a hardware
09:30 - mute not just a software mute so I do
09:32 - really appreciate having this kind of
09:34 - little control board in front of me I
09:36 - know I could go a bit crazier and get
09:37 - some more boards here but I do like
09:39 - having these kind of physical buttons
09:40 - now I have a ton of other peripherals I
09:42 - could go through but the main one I'll
09:43 - mention here is my benqe reading lamp
09:46 - now I've been talking about this for
09:47 - probably four years if you've been
09:48 - following my channel I have the same
09:50 - lamp I had back in first year university
09:52 - right now but this thing is awesome it
09:54 - goes right over top of your monitor it's
09:56 - anti-glare and what it does is provide a
09:59 - little bit of light to your eyes when
10:01 - you're actually looking at your screen
10:02 - most programmers are looking at just a
10:04 - plain screen they have no real light in
10:06 - their room other than maybe a window or
10:08 - something so having this light actually
10:10 - drastically reduces The Strain on your
10:12 - eyes I can say that from experience
10:14 - using it for a ton of years and you can
10:15 - kind of adjust the color temperature and
10:17 - the brightness of it and also if you're
10:19 - just doing something like writing or
10:20 - reading a book it's kind of nice to have
10:21 - that right over top of your setup so
10:24 - definitely recommend that if you want to
10:25 - check it out something that honestly I
10:27 - don't think I'd not have in any of my
10:29 - setups going forward alright so now
10:31 - let's get into some of the more
10:32 - expensive stuff which is my recording or
10:34 - content creation equipment so usually I
10:36 - record right here at my desk in this
10:38 - kind of scene that you're seeing right
10:40 - now and I have two cameras I have my
10:41 - main camera which is the Canon 90d and I
10:44 - have a pretty high-end Sigma lens here
10:46 - which has an F 1.8 aperture that allows
10:49 - me to get the kind of background blur
10:50 - that you're seeing and then I have a
10:52 - secondary camera which is a different
10:54 - angle I usually do shorts and stuff with
10:56 - that one and this is the Fuji xt4 this
10:59 - is a mirrorless camera again pretty high
11:01 - on camera kind of in the same line as
11:03 - the Canon 90d now both of these connect
11:05 - to capture cards in my main PC so when
11:07 - I'm recording I actually don't record on
11:09 - the camera I record from the HDMI output
11:11 - directly in OBS on my computer allowing
11:14 - me to do pretty much infinite recordings
11:16 - and not worrying about you know filling
11:18 - up SD cards and all of that now of
11:20 - course for my microphone I'm using the
11:22 - famous Shure sm7b now this is the one
11:25 - that all the YouTubers use I'm sure you
11:26 - guys know it this connects to a cloud
11:28 - lifter which gives it a bit more gain
11:30 - because these mics are very very quiet
11:32 - uh by default you need to kind of boost
11:34 - the gain up and then what I do is
11:35 - actually put this into a mic splitter
11:37 - and this splitter splits the mic signal
11:39 - to my main PC and to my Mac Mini now
11:43 - that's because the Mac Mini actually
11:44 - records the audio and then I need to
11:46 - split the audio to my main PC so I can
11:48 - use this microphone phone for like teams
11:50 - calls meetings I can record the audio if
11:52 - I'm streaming or something like that but
11:54 - the reason I go to the M1 Mac Mini is
11:56 - because the recording quality is just
11:57 - way better so I kind of need this mic
11:59 - signal in two different places which is
12:01 - why I have this more complicated kind of
12:03 - splitter setup configured now of course
12:05 - I also have some lights here I control
12:06 - all of these with a remote control and
12:09 - the way I've set everything up is that I
12:10 - can pretty much just sit down press like
12:12 - two or three different buttons and be
12:13 - ready to record not have to worry about
12:15 - doing a set setting up the light setting
12:17 - up the camera getting a tripod out I
12:19 - want to be able to just go as fast as
12:20 - possible so that's kind of how I've
12:22 - optimized my setup okay so now quickly
12:24 - I'm just gonna go through a few extra
12:25 - things in my setup that didn't really
12:27 - fit into a section so first of all
12:29 - pretty much everything you see that's
12:30 - connected to power especially if it's a
12:32 - computer is running off of a UPS which
12:35 - is an uninterruptible power supply I
12:37 - have three of them in this office and
12:39 - they all have all the computers monitors
12:41 - Etc on battery backup meaning that if
12:44 - the power goes out these are going to be
12:45 - protected and I can actually use them
12:46 - for a few minutes allowing me to kind of
12:48 - save my work or close some things up
12:50 - before I have to shut off my machine
12:52 - other than that I've actually got a 20
12:54 - terabyte home file server this is what
12:56 - allows me to work on all these different
12:58 - machines and kind of share different
12:59 - files between them super easily since
13:01 - I'm using different operating systems I
13:03 - can't just use airdrop or something like
13:05 - I would use on Mac so I actually have
13:07 - this dedicated file server that I built
13:09 - myself that stores all of my videos all
13:11 - of my audio files Etc and allows me to
13:13 - very easily transfer the files and
13:15 - access them between my different
13:16 - computers so that is my setup I could
13:18 - probably do an hour long video going
13:20 - through everything showing you the cable
13:21 - management showing you all of the
13:23 - million things that I forgot to talk
13:24 - about here but I think this was a good
13:26 - high level overview and hopefully gave
13:28 - you a little bit of inspiration for
13:29 - things maybe you can add to your setup
13:31 - or at least just entertain you a bit so
13:32 - you can go through and see kind of all
13:34 - this high-end tech gear anyways I want
13:36 - to hear what you think leave a comment
13:37 - down below and let me know what you
13:38 - thought of my setup and if you're
13:40 - curious I have a few older setup tour
13:42 - videos that you can go have a look at
13:43 - that have some different Tech and are in
13:45 - like my University dorm room it's kind
13:47 - of uh you know a blast from the past
13:48 - there want to take a look at it so I'll
13:50 - leave those on the screen here
