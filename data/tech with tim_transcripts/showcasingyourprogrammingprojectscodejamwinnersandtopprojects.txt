00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back so as
00:02 - many of you know
00:03 - back in early august i started hosting
00:05 - the first ever tech with tim code jam
00:07 - essentially this was a coding
00:09 - competition where you could go in either
00:10 - groups of one or up to four people and
00:13 - submit some kind of project
00:15 - that fit the theme for this code jam
00:16 - which was generate
00:18 - now all of this was run through my
00:19 - discord server you can find a link to
00:21 - that
00:21 - in the description but now the code jam
00:24 - is over it lasted for 30 days
00:26 - all the participants have submitted
00:27 - their projects and i'm going to be
00:29 - showcasing to you the top
00:30 - nine projects now the way we picked
00:33 - these top nine projects
00:34 - is anyone who submitted i think we had
00:36 - about 50 submissions
00:38 - actually had to vote on their top three
00:40 - favorite projects
00:41 - that were not their own project that was
00:43 - submitted so that gave us a list of
00:45 - actually our top 12
00:46 - projects so they were top 10 but there
00:48 - was a few ties so i've pruned that down
00:50 - to nine so i can fit them all in this
00:52 - video
00:53 - and what i'm going to be doing is
00:54 - showcasing all of those projects to you
00:56 - guys some of them are really cool
00:58 - and then i'm going to be choosing and
00:59 - announcing the top three winners
01:01 - all right so that's all i wanted to say
01:03 - last thing if you want to join the code
01:05 - jam if you want to join in on weekly
01:07 - coding challenges a bunch of other stuff
01:09 - as i said join the discord server from
01:11 - the link in the description
01:12 - now let's go ahead and get started
01:17 - [Music]
01:23 - so i'm going to dive in in a second but
01:24 - i want to quickly give a big thank you
01:26 - to everyone who participated
01:28 - and i just want to mention that these
01:29 - projects are at very different levels so
01:31 - there's some of these projects that you
01:32 - guys are going to look at and be like
01:33 - that's amazing
01:34 - there's some other ones you're going to
01:35 - look at and be like oh why is that up
01:37 - here
01:37 - i just want to make you aware that
01:39 - people of any age were able to
01:40 - participate in this so there's some
01:42 - people there you know 13
01:43 - 14 years old that we're making projects
01:45 - we have some other people that probably
01:46 - are computer science students and in a
01:48 - group of four making projects
01:50 - so of course we're going to see
01:51 - different levels of projects here
01:53 - and please just be nice you know people
01:55 - put a lot of work into these projects
01:57 - and even though it may not seem the most
01:58 - impressive thing
01:59 - in the world they put a lot of effort in
02:01 - and well i appreciate that effort and
02:03 - just want to give them a thank you for
02:04 - participating
02:05 - all right so let's go ahead and get
02:06 - started the first project i'm looking at
02:08 - is the abstract art
02:10 - generator now i believe this was done by
02:12 - one person
02:13 - and i'm pretty sure this was done by
02:14 - burak kali now i apologize because i'm
02:17 - probably mispronouncing that name
02:19 - but i'm just going to boot the project
02:20 - up and then let's showcase it
02:22 - alright so this is the abstract art
02:24 - generator
02:25 - so i've actually been messing with it a
02:26 - little bit before i started showing you
02:28 - guys this let me just
02:29 - undo what i did but this is generating a
02:32 - bunch of random art when i press
02:33 - generate randomly and it looks like
02:35 - there's all these filters on the side
02:37 - here
02:37 - that i can kind of mess with and that
02:39 - will actually give me something that
02:41 - fits those filters so if i press
02:42 - generate now
02:43 - you can see i'm getting all these kind
02:44 - of rings i can choose the color palette
02:47 - let's go soft gray
02:49 - wow yeah that's really interesting so
02:51 - there's all these different color
02:52 - palettes here you can see the colors
02:53 - right there
02:54 - looks like i can choose all of the
02:56 - different properties for the different
02:58 - layers
02:59 - so let's go with filled polygons and
03:02 - cornered
03:03 - and wow yeah that gives some really
03:05 - interesting and cool shapes
03:06 - also looks like i can put some kind of
03:07 - overlays on here so it's like some kind
03:09 - of gradient or
03:11 - a little ring around okay i can remove
03:13 - that
03:14 - there's a help button i can lock these
03:17 - uh
03:18 - filters i guess and then if i press
03:20 - generate randomly
03:21 - yeah so it won't change the locked
03:23 - properties that's awesome and then i can
03:25 - export this
03:27 - let's just export this as image
03:30 - and yeah we can go to the desktop and
03:34 - there we go image is there let me give
03:36 - it a second
03:37 - and i think my computer is lagging some
03:39 - reason i'm having trouble opening the
03:40 - image but i can see the preview here so
03:42 - i'm going to believe that this is
03:43 - working fine and i guess that is the
03:45 - abstract art generator
03:46 - so just to give some thoughts on this
03:48 - this is a really cool idea i'm really
03:50 - impressed by the stuff this is able to
03:51 - create it actually looks
03:52 - really good and even just the number of
03:54 - options that are provided here in terms
03:56 - like the color palette
03:57 - uh and like all the different layers and
03:59 - the complexity and the shape size and
04:01 - how nice the ui looks
04:03 - this looks really polished i can imagine
04:04 - you put a lot of effort into this
04:06 - and i can really appreciate even just
04:08 - you know the spacing being the same for
04:09 - example in between these two options
04:11 - having buttons being consistent and kind
04:13 - of spaced out evenly
04:15 - yeah it looks really nice really awesome
04:17 - job and if you did this by yourself
04:18 - give yourself a pat on the back because
04:20 - i can't even imagine just
04:22 - trying to think about this right now how
04:23 - i would go about doing something like
04:24 - this
04:25 - all right so moving on to the next
04:26 - project here we have stranded
04:29 - i believe this is by franklin dennis and
04:31 - wow he
04:32 - fresh you can see them kind of on the
04:34 - right hand side here
04:35 - looks like this was made in c sharp and
04:37 - i have actually looked at this
04:39 - it looks like this was made in unity now
04:41 - i'm not going to read through all of
04:42 - this
04:43 - because i'm not reading through all of
04:44 - them but i believe they called their
04:46 - team
04:47 - pixel jam and yeah there was three of
04:49 - them awesome all right so let me boot up
04:51 - this project and let's see what it looks
04:52 - like
04:53 - all right so i got the project booted up
04:55 - and yeah this is a 3d game made in unity
04:58 - and already really impressive i've never
05:00 - made any like 3d games
05:02 - let alone anything in unity so it's
05:04 - really cool when i see this stuff
05:05 - working i can actually run it on my
05:06 - computer
05:07 - but it looks like i'm in a maze and i
05:09 - believe
05:10 - from doing some basic reading that this
05:12 - maze is randomly generated
05:14 - so it has these things that slide up and
05:16 - down first of all that's a really cool
05:17 - touch
05:18 - i wonder what happens if i stand on it
05:19 - and it goes up
05:21 - or maybe one oh when i get close to it
05:23 - it opens okay that's how that works
05:25 - and i believe i'm looking for wow okay i
05:27 - don't want to go off the edge of the map
05:28 - here that's interesting
05:30 - i'm looking for like the next level or
05:32 - some room or something like that so i
05:33 - will run around a little bit and see if
05:35 - i can find
05:36 - how to advance forward but if i can't
05:40 - seem to find that
05:41 - then i might just have to assume that
05:42 - this works oh wow and i have fallen off
05:45 - the edge
05:46 - okay so it seems like i am continually
05:48 - falling through the floor when i
05:51 - die i'm not sure why that's happening
05:54 - but i'm going to leave it at that it
05:55 - looks like that was a randomly generated
05:57 - maze
05:58 - really cool i like the 3d structure i
06:00 - like this little guy in the animations
06:02 - and yeah i've never made anything with
06:03 - unity so it's always impressive when i'm
06:05 - able to see kind of a finished game
06:07 - all right so this next one i have here
06:09 - is called deep card
06:10 - i'm trying to figure out who this is by
06:13 - ah here it is so it's by
06:15 - nuria ido and dolev i'm probably
06:18 - mispronouncing that so again apologize
06:20 - for that
06:21 - and again called deep card looks like
06:23 - this is a website
06:24 - it says it was javascript python css and
06:27 - html
06:28 - and the website may take a few seconds
06:29 - to load okay that's fine so let's
06:31 - look at this oh that loaded pretty much
06:33 - instantly we have deep card we made a
06:36 - deep learning neural network we fed it
06:37 - some greeting cards here's what happened
06:40 - let me click this okay so about page
06:42 - actually let's go in full screen mode
06:44 - uh this website makes personalized cards
06:46 - for birthdays and other occasions after
06:47 - making the card you can get a custom
06:49 - link to give out to your friends
06:50 - everything on this website is absolutely
06:51 - free to use awesome all right so let's
06:53 - start now what type of card do we want
06:57 - let's go with a good luck card cool
07:00 - what's your name
07:00 - my name is tim and hello there
07:04 - who is the lucky recipient let's just go
07:07 - with
07:07 - tech with tim all right next
07:10 - uh give us a few words to start off
07:13 - let's go with
07:14 - hello world the classic programming uh
07:17 - and sure finish loading your card
07:21 - a little pacman thing this is kind of
07:22 - cool loading the algorithm
07:24 - feeding the developers debugging code
07:27 - and here we are
07:29 - all right so this is cool generated card
07:30 - to tech with tim
07:33 - it says hover to open i am oh there we
07:35 - go so i guess my computer was lagging or
07:37 - something
07:38 - and there we go hello world is believing
07:40 - to live but i think
07:42 - all right so it seems as though their
07:44 - neural network may not have learned to
07:45 - speak english quite yet but this still
07:47 - is really cool
07:48 - i assume this is the link okay link copy
07:50 - to clipboard awesome
07:52 - let's see what happens if i go to a new
07:53 - tab here and i open this and awesome i
07:56 - get the card
07:57 - now i believe this card is a different
07:59 - color
08:00 - i don't know why that's the case i'm
08:02 - just going to assume that was
08:03 - intentional
08:04 - maybe but that is neat so it just
08:06 - generates a card i guess it's using ai
08:08 - for the string here
08:10 - nice little animation when i hover over
08:12 - top of it yeah really cool idea and
08:14 - again definitely fits the generate theme
08:16 - awesome let's move on to the next
08:18 - project all right so next i have the
08:20 - star
08:21 - map generator so generate a star map
08:23 - biased on the settings you choose
08:26 - we have little finchy and john paul iii
08:29 - as the authors for this one all right
08:32 - let me boot that up and i'll be right
08:33 - back
08:34 - okay so i have the star map generator in
08:36 - front of me
08:37 - first of all i like the fact that it
08:38 - comes with some welcome text here so i
08:40 - kind of get an idea of how it works
08:42 - immediately this just seems like a
08:43 - really cool idea i've never seen
08:45 - anything like this before it's like kind
08:47 - of like constellations almost
08:48 - looks like it's like randomly generating
08:50 - a bunch of stars and then it actually
08:52 - has some text popping up here so really
08:54 - cool idea
08:55 - really unique i've never even heard of
08:56 - something like this so let me just try
08:58 - doing something
08:59 - like tim let's see what that gives me
09:01 - wow so it actually just makes the stars
09:03 - out of tim and kind of randomizes that
09:05 - really impressive i don't know how you
09:06 - guys went about doing that but that's
09:07 - really cool
09:08 - i'm assuming each letter maybe you
09:10 - mapped to some kind of pattern and then
09:11 - maybe you randomized it
09:13 - let's go hello world generate that one
09:17 - off the screen but yeah that makes sense
09:18 - let's move the y
09:20 - down a bit um save oh
09:24 - i don't want to save image generate okay
09:25 - there we go actually
09:27 - let's try to save it let's just see what
09:29 - this looks like if i save this
09:31 - save it as hello and do we get it
09:34 - popping up hello
09:36 - can i open it i think my computer is
09:38 - just having some uh issues opening
09:39 - images but i
09:40 - believe that that is working let's go to
09:42 - settings oh wow so i can change a bunch
09:44 - of stuff here i can change the colors
09:46 - so i guess i can use green for the
09:48 - background for the stars
09:50 - let's go with like like a red color here
09:53 - okay use that for the stars
09:54 - constellation density let's see what
09:56 - happens if i crank that up
09:58 - uh yeah sure we'll show the
09:59 - constellations number of stars
10:02 - let's go with 10 000 back
10:05 - and generate and wow okay yeah so that
10:08 - is a drastic
10:09 - change looks like i can change the size
10:11 - oh that's really cool okay so now i can
10:13 - actually see all of the things popping
10:15 - up
10:15 - awesome that's really neat and i guess i
10:16 - can change the x position too let's go
10:19 - 23 generate and there we go
10:22 - awesome so i think that pretty much
10:23 - showcases what this is but really unique
10:26 - idea
10:26 - really impressed by this maybe the ui
10:29 - could
10:30 - use a little bit of work over here but
10:31 - i'm not too picky this is a neat idea
10:33 - and definitely fits the theme of
10:35 - generate
10:36 - so the next project i have here is the
10:37 - all in one generator
10:39 - looks like this was done by four people
10:41 - we got uh
10:42 - sars2 uh touhou
10:45 - tour yeah i'm not even gonna try with
10:47 - that one uh yeah okay you know what guys
10:49 - you this is the people that did it i'm
10:51 - not even gonna bother butchering their
10:52 - names anymore and yeah it looks like
10:54 - this is a website so let me boot that up
10:56 - all right so i have the all-in-one
10:57 - generator running so this is just
10:59 - running on a local
11:00 - web server right now but first of all
11:01 - just initial impressions
11:03 - really awesome looking website this is
11:05 - really clean looks really
11:06 - professional you've got music generator
11:09 - a nice little thing here
11:11 - maze generator password generator color
11:13 - generator
11:14 - date generator subscribe to receive
11:16 - updates
11:18 - uh address one two three four django
11:20 - street nice nice nice i can appreciate
11:22 - that
11:23 - all right let's see how one of these
11:24 - generators works get started oh i guess
11:26 - that just brings this to me
11:27 - okay let's go image generator okay this
11:30 - is cool so this is reminding me kind of
11:31 - the art generator obviously it just
11:33 - randomly does it i don't get to pick any
11:35 - parameters let's generate a new image
11:38 - okay that's an interesting looking one
11:40 - another cool one i'm
11:42 - curious how they did this or what
11:43 - they're doing to generate this image
11:44 - with but this is really neat so they're
11:46 - definitely
11:46 - generating something awesome let's move
11:48 - on to music
11:50 - uh okay i'm going to assume you didn't
11:52 - finish that one
11:54 - let's go back to the other page
11:57 - okay let's go to maze then
12:00 - and generate maze okay that's really
12:02 - neat so it's generating a bunch of
12:04 - different mazes you can see the starting
12:05 - position is kind of moving around
12:07 - awesome awesome would have been cool if
12:09 - you actually solved the maze but i know
12:11 - that's a little bit further
12:12 - uh let's go password uh password
12:15 - requirement
12:16 - i guess i put like the number of things
12:18 - i want okay let's go with that
12:19 - generate a new password awesome okay
12:22 - sweet let's go with like 45
12:24 - can you handle that nice giving me a
12:26 - nice strong password
12:28 - color create a new color generate color
12:31 - let's see if it does this
12:33 - boom is giving me a bunch of different
12:35 - hex color values and showing me what
12:36 - they look like as well as the rgb code
12:38 - that's actually pretty cool
12:39 - awesome and then date create new date
12:42 - and it generates a new date awesome so
12:45 - this is pretty impressive i like the
12:47 - fact that you guys went with kind of
12:48 - some smaller projects but tied them
12:50 - all in together that's really cool and
12:53 - the website especially this front page
12:54 - here just looks really nice really clean
12:57 - uh yeah super impressed by this awesome
12:59 - work guys let's move on to the next
13:00 - project
13:01 - all right so the next one i have here is
13:03 - chest end game training
13:05 - looks like i can actually just go right
13:07 - here to the website
13:08 - uh oh there's all this stuff here i'm
13:10 - not going to read through all that but
13:11 - let's go
13:12 - to the website and see what this is
13:15 - all right so chest endgame training is
13:17 - what this one is called
13:19 - and this is the website so they act
13:21 - actually i didn't have to run this it's
13:22 - hosted on heroku it looks like
13:24 - so select checkmate in a number of moves
13:26 - i can do random or i can choose like
13:28 - four or five
13:29 - oh okay so i think i understand what
13:31 - this is doing it's saying white
13:33 - is uh the current move and checkmate can
13:35 - be achieved in four
13:36 - moves that's really cool so what it's
13:38 - trying to get you to do is being
13:40 - is be able to look at this board and
13:42 - determine where you would need to move
13:44 - to uh actually achieve checkmate
13:46 - so that's i guess why it's called end
13:47 - game training let's go with five and
13:49 - just make sure this works for different
13:51 - ones
13:51 - awesome so it's saying okay there is a
13:53 - way to achieve checkmate in five moves
13:55 - can you figure it out that's really cool
13:57 - now i wish there was some way where it
13:58 - would tell me what that was because i'm
14:00 - not very good at chess so
14:02 - it's going to be difficult for me to
14:03 - determine if this is actually working or
14:04 - not but i guess we could go with one
14:06 - and see if we can figure that out if
14:08 - there's some move where we go for
14:10 - checkmate but it looks like yeah it's
14:11 - generating some kind of board
14:13 - that we could move to to actually
14:14 - checkmate this piece
14:16 - i'm not very good but i'm going to
14:17 - assume if i put the knight here if
14:19 - white's moved then that would checkmate
14:21 - the king here
14:22 - but yeah that is really cool so nice
14:25 - work
14:25 - again would have been cool if there was
14:27 - maybe some way that i could actually see
14:29 - what the moves were
14:30 - but good idea especially if you're good
14:32 - at chess you would probably appreciate
14:33 - this if you're trying to train and kind
14:35 - of test your brain and figure out the
14:36 - checkmate
14:37 - awesome nice work let's move on to the
14:39 - next one
14:40 - all right so next one i have here is
14:42 - password generator looks like this is by
14:44 - silly goose
14:45 - and swan amman otherwise we'll call him
14:48 - kevin i guess
14:50 - let me boot this up and let's check out
14:51 - what it is
14:53 - all right so we got the password
14:54 - generator here looks like i can pick the
14:57 - security so i can go weak medium secure
14:59 - strong let's go with strong for password
15:02 - length
15:03 - let's go minimum length 10 maximum
15:07 - length 20. sure we want a capital letter
15:10 - and a symbol
15:10 - let's also make it have two slashes in
15:13 - it i guess
15:14 - uh and generate password all right sweet
15:17 - so we got
15:18 - c dollar sign yeah just some random
15:20 - generated password that's kind of cool
15:22 - let's keep doing this
15:24 - and yeah that is working now my only
15:26 - complaint is that i had two slashes here
15:27 - and it's just moving one
15:29 - i guess what that's saying is like okay
15:31 - just put stuff here that you want to
15:33 - show up in the password and we'll make
15:34 - sure that it shows up
15:35 - but if it's duplicate characters and i
15:37 - guess it just assumes oh you just want
15:38 - one of those
15:39 - anyways this neat i guess if i get rid
15:41 - of symbol then we only get
15:43 - well i guess pound is pound still
15:45 - assemble i don't know but anyways this
15:46 - is kind of working
15:47 - and yeah that is cool so nice work
15:50 - generates password
15:51 - i also like the fact that you have this
15:53 - so the first part of the password is a
15:54 - slice of the alphabet
15:56 - copy basic passwords do not say when
15:57 - window is closed so making that a bit
15:59 - user friendly and telling me hey
16:01 - i got to copy this beforehand if i want
16:03 - to save this password
16:05 - awesome nice work and let's move on all
16:07 - right so next project i have here is the
16:09 - tree generator this one is short enough
16:11 - that i can actually read through it it
16:13 - says this is made using c
16:14 - plus plus and opengl and is mimicking
16:17 - fractal patterns using recursion
16:19 - awesome okay so yeah we can see this
16:20 - written in c 89.4 percent
16:22 - c plus plus 9.6 and gl sl i don't even
16:26 - know what that is
16:27 - one percent all right so immediately
16:30 - seeming a little bit more advanced to
16:32 - some of the python stuff i mean just
16:33 - because it's written in c in all those
16:35 - languages
16:36 - but let me run this and let's see what
16:37 - it looks like all right so when i run it
16:39 - i get this little
16:40 - thing popping up here it says this is a
16:42 - tree generator using fractal approach
16:44 - blah blah blah rendering is done using
16:46 - custom engine majoring the gem
16:48 - using modern opengl techniques use wasd
16:50 - to move
16:51 - mouse to rotate the camera click to
16:53 - generate a new tree and escape to exit
16:55 - awesome let's press enter i guess and
16:57 - see what this is wow okay look can i go
16:59 - full screen oops
17:00 - i didn't want to do that i want to go
17:01 - into full screen mode uh
17:03 - f11 ah that's not working okay you know
17:06 - what i'll just do it here
17:07 - and i guess i can kind of mess around
17:09 - and see what this looks like
17:10 - wow okay that is really cool
17:14 - so this is a really realistic looking
17:16 - tree like i'm quite impressed by uh
17:19 - what this looks like can i i want to go
17:22 - down
17:22 - i don't know how to go down let's keep
17:24 - clicking oh wow another tree okay so
17:26 - this generates like pretty fast
17:29 - immediately knowing how this is done
17:30 - just using recursion i'm pretty
17:32 - impressed by how many fractals there is
17:34 - and how quickly this actually generates
17:36 - and oh my god this is a huge tree let me
17:38 - see if i can
17:39 - jesus if i can move out and see this
17:42 - properly
17:42 - yeah this is a really neat project
17:45 - awesome work i've never messed around
17:47 - with like 3d graphics and stuff before
17:48 - so this is really cool to see
17:50 - and looks like it quit out after that
17:52 - but awesome work tree generator looks
17:54 - really cool and really impressed with
17:56 - all this
17:56 - rendering and 3d stuff i have no idea
17:58 - how to do any of that
18:00 - now i apologize i forgot to mention this
18:02 - is by storm creeper it looks like this
18:03 - is by
18:04 - one single person the tree generator i
18:06 - didn't see your name in the side so i
18:07 - forgot to mention it but storm creeper
18:09 - nice work on the tree generator
18:11 - all right so next we have a password
18:13 - encryption generator so i'll go into
18:15 - that in a second
18:16 - looks like this is by noms
18:20 - 2168 believe that is a discord tag
18:23 - and one of these two guys is him in
18:26 - terms of the discord name again i'll
18:28 - link this down below in
18:29 - case you guys want to check that out but
18:31 - let's boot this up and let's see
18:33 - what this password encryption generator
18:34 - looks like all right so here it is
18:36 - a little bit small and some of the stuff
18:38 - is kind of cut off that's fine
18:40 - but let's pick a method let's go md5
18:43 - let's go hello
18:44 - my name is tim let's see how this is
18:47 - encrypted
18:48 - i guess i can view and unview oh okay
18:50 - that's kind of cool like i open i shut
18:53 - and it gives me the encryption nice and
18:56 - i can copy it to
18:57 - clipboard let's see if this actually
19:00 - works
19:01 - notepad paste awesome so that does
19:04 - indeed work
19:04 - that's great uh whoops go back to the in
19:08 - generator here let's try with a few
19:09 - other methods okay and it's giving me
19:12 - the encryption i don't know what hex i
19:15 - does i guess it changes it to
19:17 - hexadecimal maybe maybe that's what it's
19:19 - saying yeah actually that would probably
19:21 - make sense hex i
19:22 - i guess i can view an unview and i guess
19:24 - that's really all the show for this
19:25 - project i guess there's just a few
19:27 - different methods
19:28 - all right so that was the last one nice
19:30 - work on
19:31 - that now i'm going to showcase and
19:33 - announce the top three winners
19:35 - so in third place i have the star map
19:38 - generator by little finchy and john
19:42 - paul i wasn't sure if that's a bunch of
19:43 - eyes yeah it looks like john paul
19:45 - i congratulations guys you have come
19:48 - third place a quick refresher this is
19:50 - what their project was the star
19:51 - generator
19:52 - this is just really cool and the reason
19:54 - why i've selected this for third place
19:56 - is because this is a really unique and
19:57 - creative idea i haven't i didn't see
19:59 - anyone do anything like this
20:01 - at all all the other projects i saw were
20:03 - something that i could have predicted
20:05 - i never thought anyone was going to do
20:06 - something that looked like this and even
20:08 - though i have a few complaints on kind
20:10 - of how the ui is laid out and especially
20:12 - this settings page
20:13 - i'm willing to overlook those just
20:14 - because of the idea the execution and
20:16 - just what a neat project this really is
20:19 - so congratulations guys you've come
20:21 - third place and as i'm gonna mention
20:22 - after all these projects i will reach
20:24 - out to you and talk to you about how you
20:25 - can win your prize
20:27 - so in second place i have the all in one
20:30 - generator
20:31 - by these four people over here
20:33 - congratulations guys
20:34 - i do not know how to pronounce your name
20:36 - so i'm not even going to try
20:38 - but let me just refresh you on their
20:40 - project and talk about why i picked it
20:42 - so this is the all-in-one generator
20:44 - obviously the reason's pretty clear
20:45 - it looks really clean i'm sure you guys
20:48 - put a lot of work into the ui
20:49 - in the front end of this website you
20:52 - have a bunch of different ways to
20:53 - generate things like password color
20:55 - date image maze i'm gonna forgive the
20:58 - fact that your music
21:00 - doesn't work although that definitely
21:01 - was a factor in my decision
21:04 - but overall really good job and i like
21:06 - the fact that this really fits the theme
21:08 - and i can tell you guys put a
21:09 - significant amount of work into the ui
21:11 - and making this just feel really clean
21:13 - and really good so congratulations as
21:15 - i've said i will reach out to you guys
21:17 - and talk to you about how you can claim
21:18 - your second place prize
21:20 - now in first place as i'm sure you guys
21:22 - all have guessed i have the abstract art
21:25 - generator by burak kali
21:28 - congratulations this was by far the best
21:32 - project
21:32 - not to put anyone else's down the ui is
21:35 - really clean
21:36 - everything looks great it works
21:38 - amazingly it creates
21:40 - really awesome stuff like this just
21:42 - looks so cool i can imagine people
21:43 - actually
21:44 - wanting to use this as like backgrounds
21:45 - and wallpapers and all kinds of stuff
21:47 - like that
21:48 - you have the fact for overlays you have
21:50 - the help button
21:51 - this just feels overall really polished
21:53 - it feels like this is a finished
21:55 - project and well it just is a great
21:57 - really awesome looking and just fully
21:59 - complete project and that's
22:01 - why i'm picking it it's one of the only
22:02 - ones on this list that i feel like
