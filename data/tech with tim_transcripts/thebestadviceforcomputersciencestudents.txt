00:00 - now I know this seems obvious but
00:01 - especially in a computer science degree
00:03 - you cannot rely on your professor or
00:06 - really anyone else to teach you the
00:07 - course content you need to learn it on
00:09 - your own a lot of people seem to think
00:11 - that they're gonna get all of the
00:13 - knowledge they need by going to a bunch
00:15 - of lectures reading the textbook and
00:17 - just following the basic thing that most
00:19 - people do in other degrees you're
00:21 - probably going to be watching videos
00:22 - like mine you're going to be going and
00:23 - searching stuff up on stack Overflow
00:25 - you're going to be looking at code
00:26 - examples I only went to about 20 of my
00:29 - lectures I just stayed at home pretty
00:31 - much all day and studied on my own I
00:33 - could then focus on what I found
00:34 - difficult rather than what other people
00:36 - found difficult and I just was much more
00:38 - efficient and learned a lot more when I
00:40 - did it on my own rather than relying on
00:42 - my professors
