00:00 - so now the third Pro I have for you when
00:01 - it comes to learning machine learning is
00:03 - that you get to be a part of a
00:05 - constantly evolving field that is

00:14 - this constantly evolving and very

00:24 - absolute Geniuses out there you know
00:26 - even something like Tesla chess AIS like
00:28 - stockfish or Alpha zero all of these
00:30 - really cool things that are coming out
00:32 - and personally I am super fascinated and
00:35 - just very interested in watching what
00:36 - people are able to create with this
00:38 - technology because I can actually go in

00:43 - they've done on a very very simple level
00:45 - and it's just a really really cool thing
