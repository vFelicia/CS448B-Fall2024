00:00 - some of the best programming project
00:01 - ideas are related to automation now
00:03 - that's because these are real world
00:05 - practical applications that you'll
00:07 - probably actually finish and if you do
00:09 - put them on your resume they're a lot
00:10 - easier to talk about because they solve
00:12 - a real world problem and you had a
00:14 - legitimate reason for building them so
00:16 - that's why in this video I'm going to
00:17 - share with you a ton of programming
00:19 - automation ideas now you can code these
00:21 - in any language with any tax stack or
00:23 - with some automated tools completely up
00:25 - to you some of these projects are very
00:27 - simple some of them are a bit more
00:28 - complicated and some of them I actually
00:30 - built myself so I can give you a quick
00:32 - demo in this video with that said let's
00:34 - dive in and learn about some great
00:36 - coding automation project ideas
00:41 - now as I go through these projects
00:43 - you're going to see that I'm using a
00:45 - very visual editor and platform to kind
00:47 - of demo them and show you the
00:48 - information flow and that platform is
00:50 - make.com now I've teamed up with them
00:52 - for this video but they're completely
00:54 - free to use and you can click my link in
00:56 - the description and you'll get one month
00:58 - of their Pro Plan for free plus 10 000
01:01 - operations of course you don't need to
01:03 - use this platform you could code it out
01:04 - on your own but you'll see that it's a
01:06 - really nice low code editor that lets
01:08 - you build these automations and
01:09 - Integrations quite quickly
01:12 - foreign so with that said let's dive
01:15 - into the first project which is an admin
01:17 - or message Notifier now as you guys know
01:20 - I have a pretty large Discord server it
01:22 - has over 30 000 people in there and as
01:24 - you can see on the right hand side of my
01:26 - screen it's pretty chaotic we've got a
01:28 - bunch of channels people are pinging me
01:29 - all the time direct messaging me and I
01:31 - end up missing important messages from
01:33 - my admin and staff team so what I set up
01:36 - and make here is an integration where I
01:38 - connect to my Discord I listen to the
01:40 - admin Channel and anytime there's a new
01:42 - message sent in that channel I
01:44 - automatically go here to Gmail and send
01:46 - myself essentially a forwarded version
01:48 - of that message so that I know to go
01:51 - back to Discord and respond to that now
01:53 - that's because I checked my email much
01:55 - more frequently than I checked Discord
01:56 - and you can see I just put a subject
01:58 - here you received a new message and then
02:00 - I put the content but I could put who it
02:02 - was from I could put tags I could put
02:03 - all kinds of other information that make
02:05 - provides here from the integration
02:07 - pretty straightforward I'll quickly show
02:10 - you a little bit of a demo now I can't
02:12 - actually run this because it's not going
02:13 - to do anything since I ran this since
02:16 - I've received new messages but if I go
02:18 - to the explain flow here and make you
02:20 - can see that messages will be received
02:21 - and then they'll just be sent over there
02:23 - to Gmail and automatically sent to me
02:26 - now I can run this manually or I can set
02:28 - this on a schedule and run it every 15
02:30 - minutes 30 minutes hour whatever time
02:32 - frame I want that's pretty much it for
02:34 - the first project but this could be
02:35 - useful for pretty much any type of
02:37 - platform you have slack Discord email
02:40 - whatever where you're kind of
02:41 - aggregating import messages and sending
02:43 - them to the place that you check the
02:44 - most
02:48 - alright so moving on to project number
02:50 - two a little bit more complicated this
02:52 - one actually uses Chad GPT and AI now
02:55 - what this does is actually aggregate all
02:58 - of the money that has been sent and
02:59 - received from my bank account through
03:01 - something known as e-transfers now in
03:04 - Canada we have e-transfer this is like
03:05 - an email money transfer whereas in US
03:08 - you guys have like venmo cash app all
03:10 - these other convenient platforms now
03:12 - unfortunately my bank account doesn't
03:14 - give me a history of all of the money
03:16 - sent in and out and there's no like
03:18 - aggregated report and I wanted to see
03:20 - okay how much money have I sent out and
03:21 - how much money have I received so I set
03:23 - up this automation where what I actually
03:25 - do is I go to Gmail and I search for any
03:28 - emails from this specific address now
03:30 - this address is where all of those email
03:32 - money transfers are um kind of sent from
03:35 - so it'll tell me like Chris sent you
03:37 - five dollars you sent John 20 whatever
03:40 - it gives me information kind of about
03:41 - the receipt of the email so what I do is
03:44 - I listen for any new emails here in
03:46 - Gmail and then I send those over to
03:49 - chatgpt and I actually ask chatgpt to
03:53 - break down the email essentially to
03:54 - parse it for me and to tell me what the
03:57 - value was in the email so whether it was
03:59 - ten dollars twenty dollars whatever the
04:01 - payment actually was and if this was to
04:04 - someone or from someone and who that
04:06 - contact was so you can see I say find
04:09 - the sender and the amount from the
04:10 - following e-transfer make sure you
04:11 - return it exactly in the format below
04:13 - name comma amount
04:15 - then it says the subject and the content
04:18 - and there you go so this way I know how
04:20 - much money was sent or received and who
04:22 - it was from and now that I have a
04:24 - consistent format what I can do is take
04:26 - the content of the reply from chat GPT
04:29 - and then I can go to Google Sheets and I
04:31 - can actually add a new row or appends
04:33 - that to an existing Google sheet so you
04:35 - can see I use a little bit of kind of
04:37 - functions here at make.com to split up
04:39 - the choices or to split up the response
04:41 - so that I have first the contact as well
04:44 - as the amount and then I add that in a
04:46 - sheet now to give you an idea of what
04:48 - the sheet looks like it would be
04:49 - something like this
04:50 - where we have the date we have the uh
04:53 - this will be the contact I've just
04:54 - blurted out because I don't want to
04:55 - actually kind of leak any names this is
04:57 - the amount of the e-transfer and then
05:00 - the subject of the email which is like
05:01 - you sent money received money
05:04 - Etc now obviously this would be a lot
05:05 - longer but I don't want to docs anyone
05:07 - or share you know too much financial
05:09 - information on here but I thought this
05:10 - was a pretty cool automation again goes
05:13 - to Gmail searches for all those
05:15 - different e-transfer emails passes them
05:17 - to chat GPT uses chat gbt to parse the
05:20 - email goes to Google Sheets and then
05:22 - updates a kind of shared Google sheet or
05:24 - whatever sheet I have here with all that
05:26 - information so I could go in and be like
05:28 - oh crap I spent a thousand dollars this
05:30 - month paying people money or vice versa
05:32 - I've received x amount of money pretty
05:35 - useful and something that I definitely
05:36 - wish I had back when I was using
05:38 - e-transfer all the time
05:42 - so the next automation is one that's a
05:45 - lot more complicated but something I've
05:46 - actually been using and that I really
05:48 - wanted to build regardless of the video
05:49 - so what this automation does is it
05:52 - essentially finds all of the receipts
05:53 - that are in my inbox and automatically
05:55 - uploads those to Google Drive now you
05:57 - may say well why do you need that well
05:59 - for me I have a bookkeeper that manages
06:01 - all of the accounting for my business
06:03 - but my bookkeeper needs to know all of
06:05 - the receipts all of the payments like
06:07 - all of that stuff they need and I don't
06:09 - want to give them access to my personal
06:10 - email so what I have to do every month
06:12 - is I have to go in I'll actually show
06:14 - you here and on Google Drive I create
06:16 - all of these different folders labeled
06:18 - by month labeled by day and I put in all
06:20 - of the different receipts all of the
06:21 - payments all of the transactions and
06:23 - then he can go look at this and file it
06:25 - correctly in our accounting software now
06:27 - that's fine it doesn't take me a ton of
06:29 - time but a lot of times I miss receipts
06:31 - and it's just really inconvenient to do
06:33 - that so what I did to mitigate that is I
06:34 - made this automation where what I'm
06:36 - doing is checking for any new email so
06:38 - it's rotting like every 50 minutes every
06:40 - 30 minutes whatever schedule I want it
06:42 - then takes the email content so any new
06:44 - emails received passes it to chat gbt
06:46 - and it pretty much says hey tell me if
06:48 - this is an email or not so rather than
06:50 - me having to write a big machine
06:51 - learning model or do something
06:52 - complicated I just dump all the content
06:54 - to chat EBT give it a really simple
06:56 - prompt that says you know tell me if
06:57 - this is an email or not I'm here and I'm
07:00 - checking sorry in this router uh oops
07:02 - didn't mean to do that
07:03 - it's right here uh is this an email so
07:06 - if it responds yes then what I'm going
07:07 - to do is save that email as a PDF then
07:10 - I'm going to go and I'm going to start
07:11 - looking for where I need to save this
07:13 - inside of Google Drive so you see this
07:15 - kind of mess over here what this is
07:16 - doing is essentially locating the
07:18 - correct folder to place this email in
07:20 - because if we go back here you can see
07:22 - that I have like the month that I'm in
07:24 - so 08 223 and then I would have this
07:26 - specific day so what I actually need to
07:28 - do is I need to First Look okay does the
07:30 - month exist if the month folder exists I
07:33 - need to go inside of it then I need to
07:35 - check if the day folder exists if the
07:37 - day folder exists I need to go inside of
07:38 - it and if either of those folders don't
07:40 - exist I need to create them so you'll
07:42 - see that what I'm doing here and I don't
07:44 - want to go into all of the code is I'm
07:45 - essentially checking okay does the month
07:47 - folder exist well if it exists go here
07:49 - and then I'm checking okay does the day
07:51 - folder exist well if it doesn't create
07:53 - it and then upload it if it does just
07:55 - upload it inside of that folder now
07:56 - appear is pretty much the same chain
07:58 - except we're just creating the month
08:00 - folder first because if the month folder
08:02 - doesn't exist we need to make that first
08:03 - before we can go ahead and upload into
08:05 - the day folder now that I look at it it
08:07 - looks a little bit redundant the way
08:09 - that I've set this up in make.com
08:10 - obviously if you guys were coding it you
08:12 - could do it probably a bit cleaner but
08:13 - you get the idea right so I have this
08:15 - kind of complex automation where I'm
08:16 - checking Google Drive folders uploading
08:18 - stuff to Google Drive and this actually
08:20 - works really well where anytime I get a
08:22 - new receipt now it just automatically
08:23 - uploads it to Google Drive obviously it
08:25 - can make a few mistakes but generally
08:27 - it's catching a bunch of receipts and
08:29 - putting them in there so I'm spending a
08:30 - lot less time updating this kind of
08:32 - accounting record that I have for my
08:34 - bookkeeper
08:37 - [Music]
08:38 - all right so now let's get into a few
08:39 - more ideas this one I actually didn't
08:41 - finish myself but I was working on it
08:43 - the idea was to look at all of the
08:45 - GitHub issues that were on a specific
08:47 - repository kind of compile them into
08:49 - some kind of summary and then send that
08:51 - to my Gmail now what I wanted chat GPT
08:54 - to do in this instance was actually rank
08:56 - all of the issues by severity based on
08:58 - the description of them and then kind of
09:00 - send me an email and say Hey you have
09:01 - two critical issues that you need to
09:02 - look at you have one moderate issue and
09:04 - you have a bunch of issues that don't
09:05 - really matter that way I don't have to
09:07 - manually go through them and say oh I
09:08 - really need to respond to this issue I
09:10 - would just wait every day for kind of a
09:12 - summary email from really chat gbt that
09:15 - would say Hey you know you need to
09:16 - respond to these ones you don't need to
09:17 - respond to this one and it would make my
09:19 - life easier couldn't really get that one
09:21 - working too quickly so I skipped doing
09:23 - that for now interesting idea though and
09:25 - you guys could probably build that out
09:30 - all right so those were all the projects
09:31 - that I actually attempted to build but I
09:33 - did have a few other ideas so I'll share
09:34 - them with you here one of them would
09:36 - just be an automated code reviewer now
09:38 - you could do this with something like
09:39 - chat gbt I think there's probably some
09:41 - other uh you know AI Bots that you could
09:43 - use as well the idea would be anytime a
09:45 - pull request is uploaded you take each
09:47 - of the individual files send them to
09:49 - chat gbt chat EBT reviews the code and
09:52 - then leaves comments or tells you what
09:54 - the comment should be that you should
09:55 - leave now there's probably someone who's
09:57 - already set up a GitHub integration for
09:59 - this if someone hasn't done that then
10:01 - you could go ahead and build that and
10:02 - that'd be a really cool and useful thing
10:04 - to have like an AI bot automatically
10:06 - reviewing your code pretty simple to do
10:09 - you could get some probably pretty
10:10 - valuable feedback and the nice thing is
10:12 - you're not relying on chat gbt for any
10:14 - critical changes or updates if it gives
10:16 - you some gibberish you just ignore it
10:17 - and you move on
10:21 - another idea is to do something like a
10:23 - slack summarizer let's say you're really
10:25 - busy or you're like a CEO or a boss you
10:27 - get a ton of slack messages maybe you're
10:29 - away for a vacation or something set up
10:31 - an automation where what it will do is
10:32 - summarize all of the main points that
10:34 - you've received on Slack are all the
10:36 - main messages so I can kind of read
10:37 - through the entire Channel or read
10:39 - through direct messages with specific
10:41 - people you set and give you a quick
10:43 - summary of kind of the important
10:44 - information and what you need to know I
10:46 - think that's pretty easy to set up you
10:47 - would just take all of that info pass
10:49 - that to something like chat gbt you guys
10:51 - can tell I use chat GPT for literally
10:53 - everything now and it could spit out a
10:54 - quick summary and be pretty useful
10:58 - foreign next something like an inbox
11:01 - organizer so you could actually set up
11:03 - an automation using something like
11:04 - make.com or you could just code this
11:06 - yourself where anytime you receive a new
11:08 - email it can automatically categorize
11:10 - that for you in some kind of folder now
11:13 - obviously you could set that up on Gmail
11:14 - itself but you may want some more
11:16 - advanced filters or some more AI behind
11:18 - that where you don't need to go and
11:20 - write all of these crazy filters in
11:21 - Gmail you can just do something like hey
11:23 - chat GPT categorize this email into one
11:26 - of the five following different
11:27 - categories get the response from chat
11:29 - gbt and then just set that flag or set
11:32 - that folder or category on the email
11:38 - lastly this is probably an easy one you
11:40 - could set up something like a weather
11:41 - forecast updater email or whatever you
11:43 - want to call it where maybe every Monday
11:45 - you get a text message that tells you
11:47 - what the weather's going to be like or
11:48 - you get an email or you get something in
11:50 - slack or Discord wherever you want to
11:52 - set it up I'm not sure how useful that
11:53 - would be because you could just go to
11:55 - the weather app and check it yourself
11:56 - but kind of a fun project if you wanted
11:58 - to work on it you'd hook into some
11:59 - weather API there are a ton of them
12:01 - available and then something like twilio
12:04 - or just Gmail and have that kind of
12:06 - automatically send you an email or some
12:08 - update where you can see it quite
12:09 - quickly anyways I think that's going to
12:11 - wrap up this video on different
12:13 - automation projects to work on the point
12:15 - here was to give you some real world
12:16 - automation ideas once and I have
12:18 - actually built that I use for real world
12:20 - use cases so you guys can get some
12:22 - inspiration and think of things that you
12:24 - could work on let me know what project
12:25 - ideas you guys are working on in the
12:27 - comments down below always nice to see
12:29 - those and obviously for other people to
12:30 - read through them and get some
12:32 - inspiration and motivation anyways I
12:34 - hope you guys enjoyed if you did leave a
12:35 - like subscribe to the channel check out
12:37 - make dot com the sponsor of this video
12:39 - and I will see you in another one
