00:01 - [Music]
00:06 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:08 - video so I have to start off by just
00:10 - giving a massive thank you to everyone
00:12 - who's been subscribed to the channel and
00:14 - to everyone this helped me get to this
00:15 - point yesterday was officially the day
00:18 - that we hit 10,000 subscribers and I
00:20 - can't tell you guys how thrilled I am
00:22 - about done how long I've been waiting
00:24 - and trying to accomplish this goal so
00:26 - obviously a massive thank you to all of
00:28 - you guys I couldn't have done it without
00:29 - you and the amount of support that you
00:31 - guys showed me on this channel
00:32 - it's just unreal and it's the reason
00:34 - that I keep going and keep posting
00:35 - videos so before I get into this video
00:38 - I'm gonna be doing a Q&A I just want to
00:40 - talk about kind of what's going on for
00:42 - the next week or so so I'm gonna be
00:43 - really busy with school actually have
00:45 - three midterms coming up in a few days
00:47 - so it's unlikely that I'm gonna get to
00:49 - posting more than maybe one other video
00:52 - before those midterms on the weekend so
00:54 - I apologize in advance that there won't
00:56 - be many much tutorial content coming out
00:58 - but after that weekend I'm done with the
01:01 - busyness of school done midterm season
01:03 - or whatever you want to call it and then
01:04 - I'll be getting right back into regular
01:07 - uploads and we'll be getting right back
01:08 - on track so hopefully you guys can bear
01:10 - with me on that
01:11 - so starting this video I just want to
01:13 - say like you guys ask me a ton of
01:15 - questions and I get the same questions
01:17 - all the time so I'm gonna start
01:19 - responding to those ones and then I kind
01:20 - of go through some other questions that
01:22 - I get really commonly and just answer
01:24 - those for you so one of the first
01:26 - questions I get all the time it's really
01:28 - simple answer is how old are you now I
01:31 - could not tell you guys how many times I
01:33 - can almost a day I get this question at
01:35 - least once a day so the answer that is
01:37 - 18 and a bit more context 18 years old
01:41 - right and I'm in computer science first
01:44 - year at university because that's also
01:45 - another question that goes along with it
01:47 - are you in school are you doing this
01:48 - professionally what not so I'm by no
01:50 - means a professional programmer or
01:52 - computer scientist I am still learning
01:55 - just like you guys but I love to share
01:57 - my knowledge online and to help out
01:58 - people that were at some point in my
02:00 - position learning and getting better
02:01 - with computers and what okay so the next
02:04 - question is how many programming
02:06 - languages do you know and what is your
02:08 - favorite programming
02:10 - language now I used to know quite a few
02:13 - back when I was learning like when I was
02:14 - like 12 or 13 so I'll go through them
02:16 - quickly but right now the only ones I'm
02:18 - really comfortable programming in would
02:19 - be c-sharp Java and Python and then
02:22 - maybe a bit of Swift but essentially
02:24 - when I started I knew HTML CSS
02:27 - JavaScript PHP that was kind of like one
02:30 - stage of programming all the web
02:31 - development kind of stuff and then I
02:33 - moved into c-sharp where I just kind of
02:36 - did c-sharp for about a year and then I
02:38 - did Python and then a bit of Swift
02:41 - because I was working on some apps and
02:42 - then I did Python and now are sorry not
02:45 - Python Java which I'm doing for my
02:47 - computer science courses right now in
02:49 - school but Python is by far my favorite
02:51 - programming language it's super powerful
02:53 - and super simple and I can write scripts
02:55 - in Python faster than I can write them
02:57 - at anything else and in some cases
02:58 - they're even more effective and more
02:59 - efficient than other languages so that
03:01 - answers that question okay so another
03:03 - question that I get a amazing amount of
03:06 - times is how do I learn programming or I
03:09 - just started learning program and what
03:11 - are my next steps what should I do now
03:13 - I've said this a million times maybe not
03:16 - in the formal video of interesting
03:17 - comments but the number one thing to do
03:19 - is to program a lot of people get stuck
03:22 - up by trying to learn syntax and trying
03:24 - to learn like the formalities of a
03:26 - language before really working on any
03:28 - projects that is by no means what I did
03:31 - to learn programming I learned like the
03:33 - very basics just enough to the point
03:35 - where I was comfortable making my own
03:36 - project or my own program and then what
03:39 - I did is I just learned and you guys
03:41 - would see like on the stream for example
03:42 - that I did the 24 hour stream I didn't
03:45 - know how to do a lot of the stuff that I
03:46 - was doing I had some kind of an idea but
03:48 - what I was doing was I was looking it up
03:50 - I was asking for help going on the
03:52 - Internet and that's essentially the best
03:53 - way to learn is because when you're
03:55 - doing projects you're gonna find really
03:57 - quickly and things you understand and
03:59 - things you don't understand and then
04:00 - you're able to kind of look at the
04:02 - things that you're having trouble with
04:03 - learn those or you also run into issues
04:06 - that you never would have seen by simply
04:08 - reading let's say a book on programming
04:09 - or going to a website now if you're an
04:11 - absolute beginner obviously that can be
04:13 - kind of intimidating trying to just go
04:14 - work on a project so I definitely
04:16 - recommend you know checking out some
04:18 - YouTube videos or doing like maybe an
04:20 - online
04:21 - and just doing that for like a week or
04:23 - two in getting the basics of program
04:25 - understanding fundamentals and then
04:26 - start working on small projects maybe go
04:29 - back learn a bit more another small
04:31 - project and really project project
04:33 - project is all I have to say do your own
04:35 - thing code things that interest you
04:36 - because that is the best way to learn
04:38 - and that's what I've done and that's how
04:40 - I've gone to the point that I'm at right
04:42 - now okay so the next question this one
04:44 - isn't as commonly asked but I figured I
04:45 - answer because I think it's pretty
04:46 - interesting is what is the most
04:48 - difficult part of programming or of
04:50 - coding now obviously this is gonna vary
04:53 - depending on each person some people
04:54 - probably tell you to syntax I'm like
04:56 - really depends for me I would definitely
04:59 - say getting stuck on a problem and
05:02 - something especially that you think you
05:04 - should be able to do and I say this just
05:07 - because I recently did that 24-hour live
05:09 - stream you guys can check that out on
05:10 - the channel but I was realizing pretty
05:13 - quickly that the most frustrating part
05:15 - was when you run into a problem that
05:17 - just stumps you and you can't get past
05:19 - it and especially for me I'm a little
05:21 - bit selfish and I don't want to just
05:22 - move on I want to try to fix the problem
05:24 - and when you keep looking at the same
05:26 - problem for so long without having a
05:28 - fresh perspective on it it can be really
05:31 - frustrating and that's one of the things
05:32 - that I was getting frustrated with as
05:34 - well on the stream was I wasn't really
05:35 - making any progress for about an hour -
05:37 - I would just be stuck on the same
05:39 - problem and I wasn't moving anywhere I
05:41 - forgot two hours I essentially had done
05:43 - nothing except figured out why my code
05:45 - didn't work right so you could say
05:48 - that's something but I think that's
05:50 - maybe one of the hardest parts is going
05:52 - maybe days or hours without really
05:54 - getting anything done and just trying to
05:56 - figure things out and if you're not
05:57 - mentally strong I want to say um it is
06:01 - quite difficult to do and I mean I'm
06:03 - sure you guys probably ran into similar
06:04 - issues where you run into a bug that
06:06 - just really frustrates you and all you
06:08 - want to do is either fix it or just give
06:09 - up on it and that's one of the probably
06:11 - hardest parts of programming is dealing
06:13 - with running into issues where you think
06:16 - everything should be working but it's
06:17 - just not ok so now I'm just kind of
06:19 - taking questions from the live stream
06:20 - that I did a few days ago I just ask
06:22 - people like ask me a bunch of questions
06:23 - and I answered them on there but I'll
06:25 - answer them again here someone asked me
06:27 - what are my thoughts on my computer
06:28 - science classes are they difficult
06:30 - that's very hard to answer because it's
06:33 - going to depend
06:34 - some persons school school but for me
06:36 - personally my computer science classes
06:38 - are very straightforward they are
06:41 - getting a bit more complicated now like
06:43 - a few algorithms and data structures but
06:45 - nothing too advanced or that I'm not
06:47 - capable of handling
06:48 - I personally don't go to many computer
06:50 - science classes because I know most of
06:52 - the concepts they're teaching and I find
06:55 - it's a lot better for me when I'm
06:56 - practicing those concepts to just be at
06:58 - home and you know work on what I need to
07:00 - work on rather than listening to a prof.
07:02 - and maybe he's trying to teach it in a
07:05 - way where other people don't know the
07:06 - concepts already whereas I'm just kind
07:07 - of reinforcing my learning so I would
07:09 - say they're very straightforward at
07:11 - least for first year my introduction of
07:13 - computing class I had last semester was
07:14 - just Python super straightforward like
07:17 - videos on my channel are way more
07:18 - advanced and a lot of stuff they did on
07:20 - there
07:20 - and now the wouldn't call it computing 2
07:23 - which is Java is a bit more advanced but
07:25 - nothing too complicated we're just
07:26 - moving into stacks right now so we did
07:28 - like Q based algorithms now we're doing
07:29 - stacks and I forget what else we're
07:32 - doing for the rest of the semester but
07:33 - pretty straightforward okay so next
07:35 - question and I'm kind of just
07:36 - formulating this in a general question
07:38 - that I get Ansel asked the lawn is are
07:40 - you software developer do you do this
07:43 - for a living is YouTube like a full-time
07:45 - gig for you most of you should know this
07:48 - is not by any means a full-time gig I'm
07:50 - by no means a software developer some of
07:52 - you might try to argue that but I don't
07:54 - consider myself a software developer or
07:56 - like a professional programmer it's just
07:57 - something I like to do and have a
07:59 - passion for YouTube is not a full-time
08:02 - thing whatsoever I'm a full-time student
08:04 - that is my priority but YouTube is
08:08 - something that I do as a hobby and I
08:10 - kind of consider like a part of my day
08:12 - now you know what I mean like when I
08:13 - wake up part of my day is slaughtered
08:15 - doing YouTube part of its to school part
08:17 - of its going to class so I just love
08:19 - doing YouTube videos I wouldn't be doing
08:21 - it if I didn't love it you guys know
08:23 - that this doesn't make me that much
08:24 - money and I don't do it obviously for
08:27 - the money that being said though if you
08:30 - guys would like to help me out and to
08:33 - support the channel you guys could go to
08:34 - my patreon link in the description and
08:36 - by simply just donating like a dollar a
08:38 - month that really shows me like a
08:39 - tremendous amount of support and if you
08:42 - guys can afford then you get a lot of
08:43 - value out of my content I would really
08:45 - appreciate that okay guys so I'm gonna
08:47 - start wrapping up the video now
08:48 - obviously I want to give another massive
08:50 - thank you to everyone that's helped me
08:52 - out everyone that subscribed to the
08:53 - channel that comments that likes it
08:55 - really does mean the world to me this is
08:57 - a massive accomplishment for me and I'm
09:00 - really excited to be at this number but
09:01 - I do have to say this is just the
09:03 - beginning of tech with Tim I have so
09:05 - many new plans so many things planned
09:07 - for the future and I'm really excited to
09:09 - see where the channel goes and I think
09:10 - you guys should be as well not being
09:12 - said quick kind of just what's gonna be
09:14 - going on in the future in some videos
09:16 - I'm gonna be trying I want to know your
09:17 - feedback on them essentially you might
09:18 - notice I'm actually recording with a
09:20 - brand new camera right now so yesterday
09:22 - right when I hit 10k I actually went
09:25 - over to the store and I decided to buy
09:26 - myself a brand new camera and lens I'll
09:29 - put like the specs for it in the
09:30 - description if you care to see what it
09:31 - is but essentially this means now that I
09:34 - have a high quality like recording thing
09:36 - that I like camera I can actually do
09:39 - videos where I'm recording more of
09:40 - myself so like face to face videos like
09:42 - this I can also do videos record like my
09:45 - PC setup or like physical things in real
09:48 - life like maybe a day in the life so let
09:50 - me know what you guys think about that
09:51 - and if there's any videos that you'd
09:53 - specifically like to see that maybe
09:54 - aren't tutorial content and maybe more
09:56 - about me or my life or whatnot I do want
09:59 - to try to do like maybe a video using
10:01 - this camera a week that's kind of the
10:03 - goal right now we'll see where it takes
10:05 - us and what it looks like with that
10:07 - being said I'm gonna wrap up the video
10:09 - here another massive thank you to
10:11 - everyone and I will see you guys again
10:13 - in the next video
10:14 - [Music]
