00:00 - hey guys and welcome back to another
00:02 - YouTube video so I apologize for not
00:04 - posting for a few days I've been working
00:06 - really hard to get this game finished
00:07 - that I'm about to do a tutorial on so I
00:10 - apologize for that but all the videos
00:12 - will be done today and then I'm gonna be
00:14 - posting them every other day I think I
00:16 - have like three or four of them so
00:18 - expect that for about the next week as
00:21 - my regular uploads now for this game
00:23 - that I'm gonna be doing a tutorial on it
00:25 - is a side scroller so I'll show you a
00:28 - little bit of it right now just a sneak
00:30 - peek this isn't all of it this is like
00:31 - halfway through it you can see we have a
00:33 - little guy he runs down the screen
00:36 - there's a saw that appears or like
00:38 - there'll be another obstacle and then he
00:40 - had either has to jump over it
00:42 - or if it's an obstacle that he can duck
00:44 - under he'll have to duck under it now
00:46 - you'll see that it continually gets
00:49 - faster so as time progresses it gets
00:51 - faster and therefore gets more difficult
00:54 - because it's gonna take longer to jump
00:56 - over stuff and yeah so that's pretty
01:00 - much how the game works it's not done
01:02 - yet obviously this is just a little
01:03 - sneak peek for you guys to see okay so
01:06 - that's what I'm gonna be showing you
01:08 - right now so before we even get started
01:09 - with any of the code there is something
01:12 - that we need to download so I have a
01:13 - bunch of images there that I was using
01:15 - so just to make it easier for you guys
01:17 - I read open up little github here I'll
01:20 - leave a link to it down in the
01:21 - description below I just go ahead go to
01:24 - the page it'll look just like this click
01:26 - clone or download little green button
01:27 - and just click download zip once you do
01:30 - that just extract the zip so I'll you
01:32 - can show you guys just to make sure
01:33 - there's no confusion it's gonna say side
01:36 - scroller just drag that off to your
01:38 - desktop and then inside this folder here
01:41 - there is something called a starter file
01:43 - which is what I'm in right now so you
01:45 - can open that up and you're gonna work
01:46 - from this file so this just ensures that
01:48 - we're not gonna have any issues loading
01:49 - up any images and I have a bit of code
01:51 - in the starter file just to start us off
01:53 - so that's not gonna take too long to to
01:56 - copy down some of the complex stuff I
01:57 - have here and like all these numbers
01:58 - here you don't wanna type those out so I
02:00 - just put them in the starter file okay
02:02 - so you can see here I'll just go through
02:04 - what I have in the starter file really
02:05 - quickly and then we'll move on to the
02:06 - new code and getting the background to
02:08 - start scrolling so pretty much we have
02:10 - our imports up here pretty
02:12 - self-explanatory we're gonna be using pi
02:13 - for this game width and height of the
02:16 - screen this is just because the height
02:17 - of the background is 447 you could
02:19 - change this if you'd like and then we
02:21 - have our background image which is here
02:25 - and then we have our clock which is
02:28 - gonna set up so that we can have we can
02:30 - change the fps as we move so the way
02:33 - that I actually increase the speed of
02:35 - the game is buying credit increasing
02:36 - this speed of the FPS so that way we
02:40 - don't have to change the velocity of our
02:41 - character and of our of our background
02:45 - we just change one property I'll get
02:47 - into that in a minute then I have this
02:49 - player class and there's a ton of stuff
02:51 - in here in terms like loading in the
02:52 - images and the player jumping and so on
02:56 - so pretty much all I did in here is I
02:58 - did all the character animation because
03:00 - realistically all that's happening with
03:02 - the character is it's not actually
03:03 - moving on the screen
03:04 - he's just either jumping up or down or
03:06 - he's jumping or he's a what he called
03:09 - he's sliding down the screen right so he
03:11 - doesn't actually end up moving right or
03:12 - left he's just gonna be moving up or
03:15 - sliding down so we want to make it look
03:17 - like that so I've done all the animation
03:18 - here for you because it is pretty
03:20 - tedious to get it down and I've made it
03:22 - as good as I can
03:24 - it does look a little bit slow at the
03:26 - beginning in my opinion but this game
03:28 - isn't for like we're not gonna be
03:29 - releasing it professionally or anything
03:30 - so it's fine if it looks like that for
03:32 - now it's just for learning yeah all the
03:35 - images we load up here this massive list
03:37 - I think it has like 56 I know it has a
03:41 - hundred and six numbers in here 108
03:44 - numbers in here this is just for jump
03:46 - our character jumping so we can get him
03:48 - to jump at the exactly correct speed as
03:51 - to the looks proper so I did that for
03:53 - you so you guys don't have to copy this
03:55 - out and then yeah so that's about it for
03:58 - the starter file okay so now let's get
04:01 - in to actually coding so we want to make
04:03 - a scrolling background which means
04:04 - pretty much all the objects on our
04:06 - screen
04:07 - are gonna be standing still pretty well
04:09 - and our background is gonna be moving
04:10 - left so it makes it look like we're
04:12 - moving right so the first thing we have
04:14 - to do and this will be always do when
04:15 - we're setting up a new game we're gonna
04:17 - do our main loop so would say well run
04:20 - down here and then inside this loop I
04:25 - always like to start with my
04:27 - Loup so for event in pi game dot events
04:31 - dot get and then we start with if events
04:36 - don't type equals equals pi game dot
04:40 - quit like this now we want to quit the
04:42 - game so we're gonna do hugging dot quits
04:45 - and then simply quit like this and we
04:48 - can just do actually before we do all
04:49 - that let's do this run equals false so
04:52 - you don't run into any errors then after
04:56 - this think that's all we need for the
04:57 - event loop right now and now we're gonna
05:00 - get into our background so at the top of
05:02 - our starter file here you can see I've
05:05 - already set up two variables for us we
05:07 - have background X and then background x2
05:10 - so these two variables are gonna keep
05:12 - track of the x position of two different
05:14 - images now the way that our background
05:15 - is going to move is just by moving the
05:17 - background image so we're gonna
05:18 - continually blit the background image
05:20 - moving left at a certain speed so we
05:23 - need two images so that way it never
05:27 - goes blank on the screen and you'll see
05:28 - what I mean once we actually get into it
05:30 - so just copy this down for now so what
05:33 - we need to do here is we just need to
05:35 - actually we'll start off by just setting
05:37 - a variable up here I'm gonna call this
05:39 - speed set this equal to say 34 right now
05:43 - and then we are going to do our fps in
05:47 - here so just do clock dot tick and then
05:51 - speed like that so that this way it's
05:54 - gonna go at the the speed of our of our
05:57 - variable which we're gonna change as you
05:59 - move on now we want to move our
06:01 - background back every every frame so
06:03 - we're gonna say BG X - equal and I just
06:07 - like to use one point for if you want to
06:09 - go faster then you can modify that
06:11 - number to make it larger or smaller
06:13 - accordingly and then one point for here
06:16 - we're gonna move the other background
06:17 - image at the same speed the only
06:20 - difference is they're going to be at
06:20 - different positions and you'll see how
06:23 - it works in a second now we're going to
06:25 - do a little if statement here is say if
06:26 - v GX is less than V G dot cut underscore
06:32 - width and be due to stands for
06:34 - background by the way times negative one
06:36 - then we are going to set our background
06:39 - equal to be G dot get underscore width
06:44 - and there we go for that now we're gonna
06:47 - do another if statement and we're gonna
06:49 - copy this today I'll paste it down here
06:52 - save us some time and all we're gonna do
06:54 - is replace all the BG X with two so like
06:59 - this so there we go so the way that this
07:02 - is going to work is our first background
07:04 - image is going to start at zero zero
07:07 - right so it's gonna start at zero zero
07:10 - and then it's gonna start moving
07:11 - backwards until eventually it gets to
07:14 - the negative width of the background so
07:16 - if our background for example is 900
07:18 - pixels long then once the X values at
07:20 - negative nine hundred that means that
07:22 - it's officially off the screen we can't
07:24 - see any part of it so we're gonna reset
07:26 - it so that it goes to positive
07:29 - background width so that means that it's
07:31 - at like kind of the end of the screen
07:33 - that gets off the screen to the right
07:35 - side sorry I wish I had a visual for you
07:37 - guys to do this but I'm trying to
07:38 - explain it the best I can
07:39 - now we have another background object
07:41 - that's gonna be right behind this object
07:43 - so once this one gets to the end of the
07:45 - screen this one is just going to be
07:46 - coming back on to the screen so that
07:48 - it's gonna keep looking like it's moving
07:51 - and I'll run this in just a second to
07:53 - show you want to make sure that I have
07:54 - everything here so now what we need to
07:56 - do is we need to just set up a function
07:59 - and this function is just gonna draw our
08:01 - background and all that stuff onto the
08:02 - screen if you follow my other tutorials
08:05 - I just like to call it redraw a window
08:07 - and all the drawing that we do in this
08:09 - program I'm gonna be doing in this
08:11 - function so that if we have any issues
08:12 - with drawing we know where to go back to
08:14 - we don't have to look through a ton of
08:16 - code it's a really good way to do things
08:17 - if you're writing a game all your
08:19 - drawings should happen in one place ok
08:21 - so we're gonna draw our background at
08:24 - the background exposition and then 0 and
08:26 - then we're gonna do the same thing with
08:28 - the other background new background and
08:32 - then BG X to 0 and then we're just gonna
08:38 - update our screen so PI game doc display
08:41 - dot update now if I run the program
08:46 - running into an issue here oh that's
08:49 - because I didn't call this function I
08:50 - bet so app hearings good call
08:53 - redraw window and now let's check it hmm
08:59 - what seems to be the issue here one
09:01 - second Oh Ron equals false servant that
09:04 - Ron equals true all right now let's see
09:06 - there we go now we have a scrolling
09:09 - background now you can see right now the
09:12 - background just get moving at a constant
09:13 - speed it's not getting any faster that's
09:16 - what we're gonna cover right now you can
09:17 - see is pretty cool we have a scrolling
09:18 - background and if we wait for a second
09:21 - you'll see when the other background
09:22 - starts moving on now just due to the
09:25 - nature of this background the way it is
09:28 - you can see where the other background
09:30 - kind of comes on to the screen you can
09:31 - see right here it's like a little bit
09:33 - cut off it doesn't bother me too much
09:35 - just because this is like a starter game
09:37 - we're not going to be using this for
09:38 - anything super serious but if this was
09:41 - bothering you then you'd have to line it
09:42 - up so this background perfectly aligned
09:45 - with this one or just use a different
09:46 - background that's constant doesn't
09:48 - change as much as this one if that makes
09:50 - sense
09:50 - okay so now let's get the background
09:53 - moving faster so to do this what we're
09:55 - gonna do is we're just gonna increment
09:57 - our speed variable like this now the way
10:02 - to make sure that it's gonna go faster
10:03 - the same no matter what machine it's
10:06 - working on it's just by running a timer
10:07 - event so the way that we set a timer
10:10 - event is just by doing this rinse it pan
10:13 - game dot timer so it's set underscore
10:15 - timer like this in here we're gonna type
10:18 - user event plus 1 and then comma 500 so
10:25 - this is in millisecond so this means
10:26 - every half-second we're gonna increase
10:29 - the speed by calling this event so what
10:32 - this timer actually does is just here
10:35 - you can see we have four event and
10:36 - pygame done event I'll get it actually
10:39 - triggers this user event 1 to be true
10:41 - every half a second so to be able to
10:44 - check when this event is happening we
10:45 - have to do within our event loop here so
10:48 - we're gonna say if event dot type equals
10:54 - equals and the we're just gonna type
10:55 - what we have there user event plus 1
10:58 - then what we're gonna do is arrest a
11:00 - speed plus B pulls one
11:03 - like that now let me make sure that
11:05 - everything's looking good here I'm
11:07 - actually just gonna move this clock tick
11:09 - down to the bottom of our while loop
11:12 - because that's where it should be so
11:14 - make sure you do that and then we're
11:16 - gonna run the program running into an
11:19 - issue my game has no module timer oh
11:22 - sorry this should not be timer it should
11:24 - just be time my bad there we go and now
11:26 - you can see if we watch this it should
11:30 - start to progressively get faster
11:33 - alright
11:34 - watching and there we go it seems like
11:37 - it's moving faster okay
11:39 - pretty good so that means that's all
11:41 - working so now let's get into the next
11:43 - part
11:44 - so we have our scrolling background but
11:46 - now we need to add our character to the
11:48 - background so it's pretty
11:49 - straightforward so we've already set up
11:50 - this class here I've set this up view
11:52 - it's called player and it has one method
11:54 - in it which is the draw method so we
11:57 - just need to create an instance of our
11:58 - player I'm just gonna call my guy run ik
12:01 - and we say runner is equal to player
12:05 - let's give them an X Y width and height
12:07 - the X what should we set for is X um
12:11 - let's see here let's give them 400 for
12:15 - the X and then 313 actually we're not
12:19 - gonna do 400 that's too far in screen
12:21 - really 200 313 this is what I determined
12:24 - was like kind of exactly at ground level
12:25 - so it looked like his feet were running
12:27 - on the ground and then he's a 64 by 64
12:29 - sprite so we'll use that alright we have
12:32 - a runner now now we need to draw a
12:34 - runner so after we draw the background
12:36 - we're gonna draw a runner Y just didn't
12:38 - run it out draw put one in here is the
12:40 - name of our window and there we go that
12:43 - should be good let's run the program and
12:46 - there we are you can see that we have
12:48 - our runner and he is running on screen
12:51 - that's what it looks like at least now
12:53 - we need to make him be able to jump up
12:54 - and down and slide because you can see
12:56 - at the moment I'm clicking keys and
12:58 - clicking space up arrow key down arrow
13:00 - key and he's not moving downwards now
13:02 - another interesting thing here is as the
13:04 - background gets faster so does he and
13:06 - that's because obviously if our ground
13:08 - looks like it's moving faster faster
13:10 - then his feet are gonna be having to
13:12 - move faster so that's why we use that
13:14 - that clock speed that I showed you at
13:16 - the beginning
13:17 - okay so now let's make our character so
13:21 - to do this what we're gonna do is we're
13:25 - just gonna say keys equals and this what
13:29 - I did my other PI games tutorial - it's
13:30 - a really good way so that if the person
13:32 - hits more than one key at once it's
13:34 - gonna register properly because if we
13:36 - just tried to do the checking in the
13:38 - event loop here if they tried to hit two
13:41 - keys at the same time then they weren't
13:43 - they wouldn't both trigger so say for
13:44 - example if you hit the up arrow key and
13:46 - the right arrow key depending on which
13:48 - one you hit like a little bit faster
13:50 - that's gonna be the one that triggers so
13:51 - it's gonna be delayed if it makes sense
13:53 - so just do it this way
13:54 - say if keys and then in here I game dot
13:59 - okay underscore space
14:01 - it's a spacebar spacebar is hit or keys
14:05 - and we're just I'm just doing this so
14:07 - that the person can use either the up
14:08 - arrow key or the space bar okay
14:11 - underscore up like this okay and then in
14:16 - here all we're gonna do is we're gonna
14:18 - say if not runner dot jumping so this
14:24 - just means if our runner is not already
14:26 - jumping then we will allow him to jump
14:28 - this just so we can't be jumping well
14:30 - we're already jumping in midair pretty
14:33 - straightforward I want to say runner dog
14:34 - jumping equals true like that
14:36 - straightforward enough cuz I've already
14:38 - set up the class now we'll say if keys
14:41 - PI game key down in here okay underscore
14:47 - down then we're gonna do the same thing
14:50 - here we go say if not your honor
14:53 - dot sliding then we are somebody gonna
14:58 - say runner got sliding equals true like
15:02 - that
15:03 - so now same thing here if our runner is
15:06 - sliding when we hit the down arrow key
15:07 - we're not gonna let him slide again
15:09 - pretty straightforward there okay so
15:12 - let's test this out now make sure
15:14 - everything's working all right let me
15:16 - click the up arrow key and there we go
15:18 - our player jumps into the air now that's
15:20 - what I'm talking about with the
15:21 - animation it looks a little bit slow
15:23 - right the reason I had to do this is cuz
15:25 - the background doesn't move too fast so
15:27 - I want the character to be in the air
15:29 - for long
15:29 - to be able to get over top of an
15:31 - obstacle that would possibly be sliding
15:33 - out the screen at the speed the sliding
15:36 - same thing here I get him to slide for a
15:37 - decent hour at a time to make sure that
15:39 - he would be able to get underneath that
15:40 - obstacle and we might play with some of
15:43 - those numbers as we move through the
15:44 - tutorial if we find that it's too slow
15:46 - or it's too long and yeah so there we go
15:50 - and I think that's gonna do it for this
15:53 - first video so if you guys enjoyed the
15:55 - first video and it helped you on you're
15:58 - able to follow along please help me out
15:59 - by leaving a like and subscribing to the
16:02 - channel and the next video will be out
16:03 - in what is it today Sunday so we'll be
16:06 - out on Tuesday and then every other day
16:08 - from there I will post the rest of the
16:10 - videos alright so I'll see you in the
16:12 - next video
