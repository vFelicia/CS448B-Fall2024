00:00 - hey guys welcome back to the eleventh
00:02 - video in my Python programming series in
00:05 - today's video we're going to be talking
00:06 - about the slice operator which is a cool
00:09 - thing that we can use on lists and
00:12 - strings in Python so if you remember in
00:14 - the previous video if we wanted to
00:16 - access an element in our list we did
00:18 - fruits so the name of our list here
00:20 - which I've already got defined as apples
00:22 - pear and strawberry and then we would do
00:24 - the items so for example fruits one we
00:27 - can print that to the screen just to
00:29 - remind us what this did and we got pear
00:34 - just like that because that is the
00:35 - second item but to reference that we
00:38 - have to use one because in computers we
00:39 - start at zero right okay yeah and I just
00:43 - want to mention I didn't don't think I
00:45 - did this in the list video that you can
00:46 - actually do this on strings as well so
00:48 - say I wanted to access the e there I
00:50 - would just do text one and we get the e
00:53 - because that is the second item in this
00:56 - string or character maybe I wanted to do
00:59 - the eleventh one then that will give us
01:02 - another e because that 11 is right here
01:04 - at the end of like so yeah now what is
01:08 - the slice operator look like so pretty
01:09 - much the slice operator is these two
01:11 - square brackets but inside of them where
01:14 - you're going to put two colons just like
01:16 - this now these colons
01:18 - in between them we type some words or
01:21 - we're going to put some numbers in this
01:23 - case I'm just going to show you with
01:24 - words so we have start stop and step
01:27 - that's what goes where these colons are
01:30 - now if I remove this colon that means I
01:33 - just have a start and a stop and then if
01:35 - I remove this colon I just have a start
01:37 - and that's how we reference what element
01:39 - we want to we want to print out right if
01:42 - we had just put a number there so we'll
01:43 - add the colon back in in this now we're
01:45 - going to use numbers so the start stop
01:46 - and step works exactly the same way as
01:49 - the range function so you may remember
01:51 - when I did a for loop we did for X in
01:53 - range and then inside of the range we
01:56 - did some numbers like this so we would
01:58 - start at one stop at two and step by
02:00 - three like that right so it works the
02:03 - exact same way except in this case we're
02:04 - going to be using it on lists and on
02:08 - strings right without these numbers the
02:10 - range like this okay so let's just do an
02:13 - exam
02:14 - so let's start at zero and let's n at
02:18 - this Oh so the O is one two three four
02:21 - five but if I want to actually include
02:24 - the oh I have to put five because
02:26 - remember five would be this space here
02:28 - and if we stop on let's say four here
02:31 - you'll see what's going to happen it's
02:34 - not going to print out the O because
02:36 - when we stop we do not include that
02:38 - number remember from the range function
02:40 - so if we want to have vo will stop at
02:41 - five just like that hello okay yeah now
02:47 - if we wanted to start just from the
02:49 - beginning say we didn't know all we have
02:51 - to do is just put nothing there and it's
02:53 - going to default start from the
02:54 - beginning so it'll give us the same
02:56 - thing and then if we wanted to start
02:58 - from somewhere so say we want to start
03:00 - at two and we just want to go all the
03:02 - way to the end now we say we don't know
03:04 - how long our strings we don't want to
03:06 - count all of these things and say oh
03:08 - well let's stop at 17 or whatever number
03:10 - it may be by just leaving this blank
03:13 - it'll actually default to stop at the
03:15 - end of the string and you'll see that so
03:17 - we get
03:18 - LLO I like Python right it stopped at
03:21 - the end of the string automatically okay
03:24 - so now let's talk about the step feature
03:27 - so if we want to start at the beginning
03:29 - and we want to stop at the end we'll
03:31 - just put nothing in between these two
03:33 - colons because it's going to default
03:35 - from the beginning and default to the
03:37 - end but now we want to skip every other
03:38 - letter that means we're going to put a
03:41 - two here for the step so that way we're
03:43 - going to get h lde oh then we're going
03:47 - to skip the space here we're going to
03:48 - get I skip the space get L and so on so
03:51 - I'll show you and you see we get that a
03:54 - bunch of gibberish like this maybe want
03:57 - to go every third letter that means we
03:58 - would step by three like this and there
04:02 - we go we get a few less letters and same
04:04 - thing we could do four or five and
04:07 - continually going now say we want to
04:08 - start at the third letter R the fourth
04:12 - because we're typing three here so L we
04:14 - want to stop at the end and we want to
04:15 - step by three then you can see what's
04:18 - going to happen there so we get L I I TN
04:22 - right so a bunch of gibberish okay now
04:25 - this works again same thing for fruits I
04:27 - just
04:27 - don't have as many items in the foods
04:28 - list so that's why I was showing you
04:30 - with text but if I put the colon in here
04:33 - and we put another : let's say we start
04:35 - let's start at 1 so that means our going
04:38 - to start up hair and let's just go to
04:39 - the end and we'll print that out and
04:42 - again we get pear and strawberries so we
04:44 - didn't include the apples because we
04:46 - started up pear right so yeah that's
04:49 - pretty much how these slice operator
04:51 - works now there is one other cool thing
04:53 - we can do with the slice operator and
04:55 - it's called the insert function or the
04:57 - insert kind of thing with the slice
04:59 - operator so if you remember we have when
05:01 - we wanted to add something to a list we
05:05 - use dot append right so I showed you
05:07 - that in my list video we did troupes dot
05:09 - append and then maybe want to add
05:11 - blueberries like this I know that's
05:14 - spelt incorrectly but there we go we'll
05:16 - fix that quickly blueberries okay and
05:19 - then we can print out fruits once again
05:22 - just to see what it looks like so if you
05:24 - remember this just adds it to the end of
05:26 - the list but say we don't want to add
05:28 - blueberries to the end of the list we
05:30 - want to add it in between pairs we want
05:31 - to add it in between apples and pear we
05:34 - want to add it at the beginning we want
05:36 - to add it somewhere else right how would
05:38 - we do that
05:38 - well we can use the slice operator to do
05:41 - that so instead of using the dot append
05:43 - we'll use a slice operator sort of like
05:45 - this and this time we're going to put
05:47 - one colon and then type the indicee
05:50 - where we want to insert it so if we want
05:52 - to insert it at the beginning we're just
05:53 - going to type 0 and then 0 like this we
05:56 - do need to do them on both sides and
05:58 - then an equal sign and we'll set it
05:59 - equal to what every one in this case
06:00 - we'll just put B for simplicity and
06:02 - you'll see we get B at the beginning of
06:05 - our list now say we want it in between
06:07 - apples and pear well in that case we put
06:11 - 1 and we put 1 again like this and we
06:15 - get apples comma B comma pair comma
06:17 - strawberries just like that now if we
06:20 - want to add it to the end we would have
06:22 - to find out what number that is we do 3
06:24 - 3 I believe that should work we'll see
06:28 - ya so that I added to the end for us and
06:32 - then if we want to insert it in between
06:34 - pear and strawberry we would do to 2
06:36 - like that and there we go we get in
06:39 - between there so that's how the insert
06:40 - work
06:41 - so the slice operator I hope you learned
06:44 - how to use a slice operator today we
06:46 - will be using it a little later in some
06:48 - other videos and doing some more complex
06:49 - things with it if you liked the video
06:52 - please like and subscribe and I will see
06:55 - you again in the next one
