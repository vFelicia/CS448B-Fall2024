00:00 - hello everybody and welcome to a brand
00:02 - new tutorial series
00:03 - on linux 4 programmers now this series
00:07 - is going to aim to make you comfortable
00:09 - using a linux device and teach you the
00:11 - things that you need to know
00:12 - as a programmer about the linux
00:14 - operating system
00:15 - now specifically we're going to be
00:16 - focusing on common linux commands we're
00:19 - also going to be talking about
00:20 - networking
00:20 - ssh we're going to be talking about
00:22 - users and permissions
00:24 - the basic linux text editors that you
00:26 - need to know and then a few more
00:27 - advanced things like cron jobs
00:29 - shell scripts and how you can actually
00:31 - connect a domain with a virtual
00:33 - server now these are all good things to
00:35 - know and as a programmer you do need to
00:38 - have a lot of these skills in fact at
00:40 - many job interviews you will get asked
00:42 - are you comfortable using linux do you
00:44 - know these different linux distributions
00:46 - and depending on your answer to that
00:48 - question you may or may not be getting a
00:50 - job
00:51 - linux is just something that you really
00:53 - should be comfortable with as a
00:54 - programmer
00:55 - and even though you're not going to be
00:56 - using it every single day it's very
00:58 - important that if you do need to work on
01:00 - a linux machine you know how to do so
01:02 - so with that said let's get started in
01:04 - this tutorial series
01:05 - in this first video we're going to be
01:07 - learning how to set up a virtual linux
01:09 - machine
01:09 - and then how to ssh into it
01:14 - [Music]
01:20 - so as i mentioned the first step in this
01:22 - series is to get access to a linux
01:24 - device so you can follow along with the
01:26 - rest of the videos
01:27 - now if you have your own linux device at
01:28 - home that is great but if you don't we
01:31 - have a solution for you and that is
01:33 - lenode now lenode is actually the
01:35 - sponsor of this video
01:36 - and this series and they were kind
01:38 - enough to provide all of you with a free
01:39 - a hundred dollar
01:41 - credit towards your first lenode servers
01:43 - so if you want to get started using
01:45 - lenode go to the link in the description
01:47 - it should bring you to a page that looks
01:49 - like this
01:50 - and what you need to do is press this
01:51 - create free account button
01:53 - and it will redirect you to a page to
01:55 - create a brand new lenode account where
01:57 - your 100
01:58 - credit will automatically be applied now
02:00 - lenode is a server hosting company they
02:02 - also have a bunch of other things as
02:03 - well which i'll talk about later
02:05 - but they're awesome i've been using them
02:07 - for over two years i host
02:09 - websites on lenode i have servers that i
02:11 - use for databases i actually have one of
02:13 - my main domains hosted on lenode
02:15 - so definitely super reliable i trust
02:17 - them and i've been a long time customer
02:19 - and that's why i'm happy to have them
02:20 - sponsoring this video and this series
02:23 - now the last thing that i need to say
02:24 - about lenode is that they're actually
02:26 - going to be providing early access to
02:28 - the later videos in this series
02:30 - so almost all of these videos will be
02:32 - posted on youtube on a regular upload
02:34 - schedule
02:35 - but the last five videos will be on
02:37 - lenode's platform
02:38 - and if you want to get access to them
02:40 - immediately so as soon as i finish
02:42 - filming and editing them
02:43 - then you do need to sign up at this
02:44 - webpage right here they will be posted
02:47 - to youtube
02:47 - at a later date but i don't know that
02:49 - exact date right now
02:50 - so if you want to make sure you have
02:52 - these immediately as soon as they are
02:54 - finished
02:54 - then sign up at this page the link will
02:56 - be in the description
02:57 - and these are the specific videos so
02:59 - shell scripts cron jobs advanced
03:01 - commands deploying a simple python web
03:03 - server
03:04 - and registering a domain on lenode and
03:06 - we're going to be connecting that domain
03:07 - with the web server
03:09 - anyways let's move on now and boot up
03:10 - our first server
03:12 - so at this point in time i'm going to
03:13 - assume that your account is set up and
03:15 - ready to go
03:16 - if it's not pause the video and come
03:18 - back afterwards
03:19 - anyways now that we're here on the note
03:21 - i'll just quickly walk you through the
03:22 - platform
03:23 - so to create a brand new node you can
03:25 - press this create button here you can
03:27 - also create a bunch of other things like
03:28 - volumes
03:29 - node balancers you can deal with domains
03:31 - on the node in fact i actually host one
03:33 - of my domains on the node
03:35 - as well as two of my servers that i use
03:38 - related to my discord server which you
03:39 - guys should definitely join from the
03:40 - link in the description
03:42 - anyways lenode also has strong
03:44 - integration and support for kubernetes
03:46 - and pretty much anything that you need
03:47 - as a developer you can access
03:49 - here on lenove now let's get started by
03:52 - creating our first server you can see i
03:54 - have two right here but to create one
03:56 - we're going to press the create a
03:57 - node button or create at the top left
04:00 - and then press
04:01 - the node now from here we need to select
04:03 - a few things so the distribution of our
04:05 - lenod
04:06 - the region root password and all of that
04:08 - now for this tutorial series i'm going
04:10 - to be using ubuntu as my distribution
04:13 - so i'm going to pick ubuntu 20.10 i
04:16 - would recommend that you all use ubuntu
04:18 - as well
04:18 - and the rationale behind this is that
04:20 - ubuntu is one of the most common linux
04:22 - distributions
04:23 - a lot of the other linux distributions
04:24 - are fairly similar so a bunch of the
04:26 - stuff that i teach here
04:28 - will actually apply to other linux
04:29 - distributions as well
04:31 - of course there's differences between
04:32 - them but ubuntu is what i'm most
04:34 - comfortable with and familiar with and i
04:36 - figured that's what we should use
04:37 - for this series anyways after we pick
04:39 - our image we can go to
04:41 - our region so i'm going to select
04:43 - toronto ontario
04:44 - and then we can choose our lenode plan
04:47 - so you can see that the cheapest lenod
04:48 - plan and this is really all that we need
04:50 - for this series
04:51 - is five dollars a month and is the
04:53 - nanoed one
04:54 - gigabyte with 25 gigabytes of storage
04:57 - personally i'm gonna go with the node
04:59 - four gigabyte just because i want
05:00 - something that's a little bit faster but
05:02 - you're welcome to pick whatever you like
05:04 - and you can also see that they have
05:05 - dedicated cpu options high memory
05:08 - options and gpu options as well though
05:10 - just not in this region
05:12 - so let's stick with the node 4 gigabyte
05:14 - and then
05:15 - let's give a label to our lenove so i'm
05:17 - just going to call this one tutorial but
05:19 - i'd highly recommend you call this
05:20 - something that's meaningful to you
05:22 - because when you have a lot of the nodes
05:24 - it's hard to keep track of which one is
05:25 - which
05:26 - lastly we need to enter our root
05:28 - password so i'm going to go ahead and do
05:30 - that right now
05:31 - all right so i've entered my password
05:32 - and we're actually ready to go and
05:34 - create our first lynn node
05:35 - now before i do that i will mention that
05:37 - there's some add-ons like you can add
05:39 - backups each month and a private ip
05:41 - address
05:42 - you also if you wanted a node that's for
05:44 - a specific purpose so you wanted it
05:46 - say for like mongodb you're a minecraft
05:48 - server or something like that
05:49 - could click on the marketplace and
05:51 - within the marketplace there's actually
05:52 - a bunch of options for kind of pre-built
05:54 - lenods or pre-configured servers
05:57 - and you can press on this and then
05:58 - that's actually going to kind of do a
06:00 - lot of the necessary setup for you for
06:02 - whatever the application is that you're
06:04 - running
06:05 - anyways i just need to go back and
06:06 - reselect my distribution because we're
06:08 - not going to choose any of those
06:09 - marketplace apps but it's really
06:10 - interesting and definitely makes it much
06:12 - faster to set something up
06:14 - so i guess i'm going to have to go back
06:15 - through and redo a bit of this yes i
06:18 - need to re-enter my password
06:20 - but that's fine now we are ready to go
06:23 - so i'm going to go ahead and press
06:24 - create and this will just take one
06:26 - second and then our la node will be
06:28 - booted up and i will be
06:29 - right back all right so our lenode is
06:31 - now running you can see that because we
06:34 - see
06:34 - the running icon right here before it
06:36 - was showing booting and it was kind of a
06:38 - little yellow icon
06:39 - now quickly if you want to power off or
06:41 - reboot your lenode you can press the
06:43 - buttons right here
06:44 - we don't really need to mess around with
06:45 - anything more on this page though
06:47 - all we need to do is keep track of this
06:49 - ip address right here so find your
06:51 - lenods ip address it should just be
06:53 - under ip addresses you're going to want
06:55 - the one that's shorter
06:56 - yours will probably look a little bit
06:57 - different than this but copy it to your
07:00 - clipboard and also make sure you
07:01 - remember your root password because
07:03 - that's what we're going to need
07:04 - next so now that we have this ip address
07:06 - we actually need to ssh into this server
07:09 - and start doing something on it start
07:11 - working on the server so now before we
07:13 - move any further i do need to quickly
07:14 - thank the other sponsor of this series
07:17 - which is algo
07:18 - expert algo expert is the best platform
07:20 - to use when preparing for your software
07:22 - engineering coding interviews
07:23 - i actually work there as an instructor
07:25 - on the platform and i can highly
07:27 - recommend it as many high quality coding
07:29 - interview practice questions
07:30 - so get started using algo expert today
07:32 - by hitting the link in the description
07:34 - and using the code tech with tim for a
07:36 - discount on the platform
07:37 - so what i'm going to do now is i'm going
07:39 - to show you how to ssh into your machine
07:41 - on mac and then i will show you how to
07:42 - do so on windows
07:44 - so on mac it's really straightforward
07:45 - you don't need to download anything
07:47 - you simply need to open up your terminal
07:49 - you can do that by going to the
07:50 - spotlight search and searching for
07:52 - terminal
07:53 - then go inside of your terminal and
07:54 - simply type ssh
07:56 - then root at and then the ip address of
07:59 - your server
08:00 - after you do that simply press enter it
08:02 - will likely prompt you with some
08:04 - question that says yes slash no as the
08:06 - potential answer
08:08 - just type yes in there and press enter
08:10 - and then it should show you a password
08:12 - field
08:13 - here at the password field simply type
08:15 - in the password for your server so what
08:17 - you set up when you were on
08:18 - lenode so the root password it's not
08:20 - going to actually show you any
08:21 - characters are being typed in but it is
08:23 - working so just type it in and then
08:25 - press
08:25 - enter and then you are good to go you
08:27 - can now skip through the windows section
08:30 - but i will show you now how to ssh into
08:32 - your machine on windows
08:34 - if you do not have a mac so go to this
08:37 - website right here i'm going to leave a
08:38 - link in the description but it's simply
08:40 - putty.org
08:41 - and download this tool this is simply an
08:44 - ssh
08:44 - client and it just allows us to actually
08:46 - ssh into our server
08:48 - it makes it really easy to store all of
08:50 - the ssh credentials and information and
08:52 - all of that
08:52 - so once you've downloaded putty what you
08:54 - need to do is open that up so you can do
08:56 - that from the windows bar down here and
08:58 - you should see an application that looks
09:00 - something
09:01 - like this what we're going to do is
09:03 - we're going to paste our ip address
09:04 - right into the host name or ip address
09:07 - field
09:08 - and then i'm going to show you a few
09:09 - more things to configure our putty
09:11 - session
09:11 - so first of all the port number of 22 is
09:14 - fine you can leave it like that
09:15 - you want the connection type to be ssh
09:18 - and then
09:18 - close window on exit you're welcome to
09:21 - select what you want here but i'm going
09:22 - to leave it only on
09:23 - clean exit next what i'm going to do is
09:25 - just make the font size
09:27 - of my putty window or ssh client or
09:30 - console or whatever you want to call it
09:31 - a little bit larger
09:32 - so i'm going to go to the window thing
09:33 - here i'm going to go to appearance
09:35 - i'm going to go here where it says
09:36 - change and i'm going to change the font
09:38 - to just be
09:38 - size 24 just so that you guys can read
09:41 - this because it's a little bit small
09:42 - otherwise
09:43 - you also can change the colors and all
09:45 - of that from this page but
09:46 - we don't need to do that anyways let's
09:48 - go back to session you can see that we
09:50 - still have the ip address in
09:52 - and now what we're going to do is just
09:53 - save the settings that we just put in so
09:55 - anything that we do or anything that
09:57 - we're changing
09:57 - kind of in this putty client it's
09:59 - usually a good idea just to save it so
10:00 - we don't have to do this again
10:02 - so what we're going to do is insert a
10:03 - name where it says saved sessions
10:05 - i'm just going to call this tutorial and
10:08 - then you can go ahead and press
10:09 - save and that will save all of this
10:11 - information so just to show you how this
10:13 - works
10:13 - if i delete this ip address here and
10:15 - then i press on tutorial
10:17 - and i double press it i didn't actually
10:19 - mean to double press it let me close
10:21 - this and show you again here
10:22 - all right so i just had to reopen putty
10:24 - i don't know i accidentally double
10:25 - pressed it didn't mean to but if you
10:27 - press it
10:27 - and then you press load then you see
10:29 - that it actually loads the name it loads
10:31 - the ip
10:32 - address and if i were to go back to
10:33 - appearance here you can see the 24
10:35 - point font is still saved so anyways
10:38 - this is how you save a session i usually
10:39 - recommend you to save them and then you
10:40 - can easily load it after
10:42 - anyways once you have the ip address in
10:44 - this field and you've changed all the
10:45 - settings that you want
10:46 - go ahead and press open or as you saw
10:48 - double click on the tutorial thing there
10:51 - and then this will open up a little
10:52 - window so when you're prompted with a
10:54 - little window that looks something like
10:55 - this just go ahead and press yes there's
10:57 - no worries with this
10:58 - and then you should be good and you
11:00 - should see something that says log
11:02 - in as now i'm just going to make this
11:04 - full screen so that it's easier to see
11:06 - but when it says login as you're going
11:08 - to log in as the root user it's going to
11:10 - say
11:11 - root like that and then it's going to
11:12 - ask you for the password
11:14 - now the password is whatever you put in
11:16 - when you actually set up this land so in
11:18 - that root password field
11:20 - so i'm just going to type mine in you're
11:21 - going to notice that you don't actually
11:22 - see anything popping up but it is indeed
11:25 - being typed in
11:26 - and then once you've typed in the
11:27 - password press enter
11:29 - now assuming this password is correct
11:31 - you should get a screen that looks
11:32 - something like this
11:33 - and now you can see information about
11:35 - your lenode
11:36 - so at this point in time if you've
11:38 - successfully logged into your lenode
11:41 - you have completed this first tutorial
11:43 - series there's one last thing that we
11:45 - can do that's usually a good idea which
11:46 - is just to update the software on our
11:48 - lenode
11:48 - but after we do that that's going to
11:50 - conclude video one and then in video two
11:52 - we'll move on and talk about some basic
11:54 - linux commands you need to know so
11:56 - anyways to end here we're going to
11:57 - update the software on our lenode by
11:59 - typing sudo
12:00 - apt update like that and this will just
12:03 - run through and update all of the
12:04 - necessary packages and then the last
12:06 - thing we're going to do after we update
12:07 - is we are going to upgrade so we're
12:09 - going to say sudo
12:10 - apt hyphen up and then grade
12:13 - like that then this will upgrade all of
12:15 - the packages that we need if you're
12:17 - prompted with something that says
12:18 - do you want to use this much extra space
12:20 - just go ahead and type yes
12:22 - it may prompt you that multiple times
12:24 - after you type yes
12:25 - press enter and then you should be good
12:27 - to go so anyways
12:29 - now that our server is updated and
12:31 - upgraded we are ready to continue with
12:33 - this series
12:34 - so i hope you enjoyed if you did make
12:36 - sure to leave a like and subscribe and i
12:37 - will see you
12:38 - in the next video
