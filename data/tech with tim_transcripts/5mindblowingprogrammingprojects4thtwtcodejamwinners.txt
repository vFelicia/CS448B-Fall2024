00:00 - hello everybody and welcome to another
00:01 - youtube video so in today's video
00:04 - i'm going to be showing you five very
00:06 - impressive and pretty mind-blowing
00:07 - projects
00:08 - that are coming out of a coding
00:10 - competition that i run on my discord
00:12 - server
00:12 - which is known as a code jet so
00:14 - approximately every two months i run
00:16 - this coding competition in my discord
00:17 - server
00:18 - if you guys want to be a part of that
00:19 - you do need to be in the discord i will
00:20 - leave a link to it in the description
00:23 - and anyways during this competition me
00:25 - and the staff team for the discord
00:26 - server pick some type of theme
00:28 - this code gems theme was visualization
00:31 - and then you can get in teams of pretty
00:33 - much however many people you want or you
00:34 - can work alone as well
00:36 - and then you can work on some project
00:37 - that relates to the theme so all of the
00:39 - projects you're gonna see here are
00:40 - related to visualization
00:42 - anyways then what we do is we give the
00:44 - kind of contestants i guess a month to
00:46 - work on this project
00:47 - at the end they must submit these
00:49 - projects and then there's community
00:51 - voting so everybody who actually partook
00:53 - in the code gym gets to look at all of
00:54 - the projects
00:55 - vote on their favorites and then the top
00:57 - five are reviewed in a youtube video
01:00 - so anyways that is what this video is
01:01 - i'm reviewing the top five projects
01:03 - i've already had a look at them as i
01:04 - said they're very impressive anyways
01:06 - let's get into the video and let me show
01:08 - you what people actually did
01:13 - [Music]
01:18 - so quick side note here there is
01:20 - actually a website that has all the
01:21 - information you need to know relating to
01:23 - the code jam this actually where you
01:24 - sign up for the code jam
01:26 - and vote and do all of that kind of
01:27 - stuff this website is twt
01:29 - codegem.net i'll leave a link to it in
01:31 - the description it was actually
01:32 - developed by mostly the staff team of
01:34 - the discord server and some community
01:36 - contributors so massive thank you to all
01:38 - of you guys
01:39 - and a quick thank you to everyone who
01:40 - participated in this code jam
01:42 - i think this is really fun and like i
01:44 - say in all of these videos
01:46 - yes i am giving out cash prizes to the
01:48 - teams that win but the idea behind this
01:49 - is really just to give you guys an
01:51 - opportunity to showcase your programming
01:53 - skills
01:53 - give you an excuse to work on a project
01:55 - and learn something new
01:56 - and well i hope that everyone that
01:58 - participated in the code jam had a good
01:59 - time
02:00 - and at least was able to create
02:01 - something and learn a little bit on the
02:03 - way so anyways with that said let's get
02:04 - into the video i have five projects
02:06 - to show you all right so the way that
02:08 - this is going to go is i'm going to
02:09 - start by showing you the github
02:10 - repository for the project that i am
02:12 - about to showcase
02:14 - i will quickly mention who actually
02:15 - worked on this code give them a little
02:16 - bit of a
02:17 - shout out and then i will actually get
02:19 - into the project demo it give some of my
02:21 - thoughts on it and then at the very end
02:22 - of the video i will announce the top
02:24 - three winning teams
02:25 - now the first thing to mention here is
02:26 - the way i'm kind of grading or marking
02:28 - these teams is based on first of all
02:30 - how well did their project fit the theme
02:32 - how polished and finished was the
02:34 - project was there a lot of work that was
02:36 - put into it did it seem like it was
02:37 - something that was done
02:38 - last minute that's something i'm
02:39 - definitely considering and then lastly i
02:41 - always look at these projects from the
02:43 - angle of would i actually use this
02:44 - does this kind of product platform
02:47 - project whatever
02:48 - actually makes sense is this something
02:49 - relatively practical
02:51 - and yeah would i actually see myself
02:53 - potentially using what it is that they
02:55 - built
02:55 - so anyways without further ado first
02:57 - project here this is called
02:59 - violise i think i'm pronouncing that
03:00 - correctly this is my tech guy 940
03:03 - otherwise known as
03:04 - just for fun he has been a part of i
03:05 - think every code gem so massive shout
03:07 - out to you
03:08 - and anyways let me go to the website
03:10 - which i believe is in the next tab here
03:12 - awesome so his website vlise of course
03:15 - you know fist the theme of visualize
03:17 - says visualize everything at
03:18 - one place visualize unique things
03:20 - starting from a double pendulum to math
03:22 - problems
03:23 - awesome so there's a few different
03:24 - things on this website first initial
03:26 - thoughts i think this looks awesome
03:28 - whenever i see these kind of really nice
03:29 - landing pages and you know the nice
03:31 - scrolling feature
03:32 - and all of that it just gives a really
03:33 - nice first impression of the website so
03:35 - i'm not going to read everything
03:36 - obviously i don't want to spend too long
03:38 - on each project
03:38 - but i'll kind of scroll through it and
03:40 - obviously you guys can check this out
03:41 - i'll link all of the github repositories
03:43 - in the description
03:44 - so what we provide double pendulum get
03:46 - viz ownviz
03:47 - mathviz codeviz gdp growth okay cool so
03:51 - and there's a little messages form
03:52 - so let's get started with the double
03:54 - pendulum let's see how this works
03:56 - okay sweet so it just visualizes the
03:58 - double pendulum uh let's add another one
04:01 - with n okay let's add a bunch of them
04:03 - and see how this works
04:04 - awesome okay that's pretty cool i can
04:06 - press space to pause and stop it
04:09 - nice looks really clean and i can remove
04:11 - stuff with r switch that's a double
04:13 - pendulum
04:14 - uh what else do we have features
04:17 - there is git biz okay so i need to find
04:20 - a github repository okay i'll be right
04:22 - back i'm just going to insert one in
04:23 - here
04:24 - all right so i just input one of my
04:25 - github repositories so i put my name and
04:27 - then i put the name of the repository
04:29 - and you can see that i can look at all
04:30 - the different forks and when they were
04:31 - happening i guess i can look at
04:33 - different issues although i don't know
04:34 - if there was actually any issues for
04:35 - this oh there was a few issues okay
04:37 - i can see some nice graphs awesome this
04:39 - looks really fancy and professional
04:40 - although it is a little bit slow to load
04:41 - but i can you know forgive that
04:43 - you can see the languages or the
04:44 - language percentage used in the project
04:46 - sweet yeah this looks really nice i i
04:48 - guess submit oh yes submit just change
04:50 - this and then of course i can see when
04:51 - it was created the default branch
04:52 - contributors forks
04:54 - issues stars owner and then the link to
04:56 - the repository
04:57 - very nice this is really cool and i
04:59 - imagine if i had a more complex
05:00 - repository this would look even cooler
05:03 - awesome we'll look at a few more of the
05:04 - features here so we can go to ownviz
05:06 - visualize your own data x and y on a
05:08 - graph uh okay
05:11 - okay let's just 10 20 does it say i do
05:13 - space between it
05:14 - okay 10 20 30 40
05:18 - 10 20 30 40. let's submit and see if
05:21 - that works okay so i do get some nice
05:23 - graphs of that
05:24 - awesome okay sweet let's go to some more
05:27 - features here
05:28 - mathviz let's see what this one is uh
05:31 - math equation visualizer okay
05:33 - x to the exponent two plus y to the
05:37 - exponent 3 minus
05:40 - x over x to the exponent 2
05:43 - plus 7. let's see what this gives us
05:45 - submit
05:47 - oh i guess i have to make this an
05:48 - equation let's say equals 0. okay
05:50 - can you solve that for me uh submit
05:53 - solutions okay so right away like i'm
05:55 - not really getting any output i imagine
05:56 - the way i put the equation in is
05:58 - probably incorrect
05:59 - but maybe it should give me some type of
06:00 - error message so i'm just going to skip
06:01 - that one i'll go on to the next feature
06:04 - code vis visualize your code okay let's
06:06 - just say
06:07 - for x in range 10
06:11 - print oh i guess the tab key doesn't
06:13 - work in there okay
06:15 - print x let's submit let's see what this
06:18 - gives us
06:19 - okay that's cool so i can like step
06:21 - through the code and see what everything
06:22 - looks like that's interesting
06:24 - nice interesting visualization okay
06:27 - features uh gdp growth you guys will
06:29 - notice i'm going fairly fast i just want
06:31 - to make sure i get through everything
06:32 - united arab emirates okay cool so i can
06:35 - go to
06:36 - oh that's interesting so i guess as the
06:39 - year goes on it's kind of showing me the
06:40 - gdp growth of the different countries
06:43 - wow that's really interesting i wonder
06:44 - how he made this damn okay that looks
06:46 - really cool
06:47 - sweet okay i guess that's pretty much it
06:49 - for this project i know i didn't get
06:50 - into everything too
06:51 - in depth but really impressive i think
06:53 - everything looks very professional
06:54 - uh there's a few things like i wish
06:55 - there would have been a little bit more
06:56 - help on how to use some of the
06:57 - visualizers just because i feel like i
06:59 - kind of
07:00 - didn't really get the full use case out
07:01 - of this because i just didn't really
07:02 - know how to use some of the different
07:04 - visualizers here
07:05 - but other than that yeah definitely
07:06 - really interesting really professional
07:08 - looks great
07:08 - let's move on to the next project all
07:11 - right so the next project i have here is
07:12 - called
07:13 - figurify i think that's probably how you
07:15 - pronounce it although that obviously is
07:16 - a made-up word
07:17 - i'm trying to find the contributors here
07:19 - let's go to insights
07:21 - contributors and let's see okay so it
07:23 - looks like it was just snowball sh that
07:25 - worked on this project so another solo
07:27 - project
07:28 - sweet and now let's hop over to the
07:30 - website and let's see what it actually
07:31 - looks like
07:32 - okay so let me go back to kind of the
07:33 - homepage here i was messing around with
07:35 - it before so figurify the algorithms
07:37 - right in your browser okay awesome and i
07:39 - like all of these kind of little bubbles
07:40 - popping out that's a nice touch
07:42 - uh here's what you can do visualize 2d
07:44 - data visualize sorting algorithms and
07:46 - visualize the minimax algorithm
07:48 - awesome okay so let's go into 2d data
07:51 - and let's see how this looks
07:53 - alright can i move this point no but i
07:54 - can oh that's interesting so i can
07:56 - actually see like different parts of the
07:57 - graph if i highlight it
07:59 - i can zoom out nice what does this do
08:01 - download oh that's an interesting
08:03 - thing i can change this to a bar graph
08:06 - sweet okay let's add some more data
08:08 - more data to this graph here so let's go
08:10 - negative 20
08:12 - and negative 20. let's go 10
08:16 - 100 and let's go 120
08:21 - graph and okay nice that looks great
08:24 - let's change this back to an
08:25 - area graph suite to a line graph nice
08:29 - histogram gives me the same thing as the
08:32 - bar graph
08:32 - uh i'm actually a histogram why can i
08:34 - not remember what a histogram is
08:35 - histogram and bar graph are not the same
08:37 - thing are they
08:37 - like is this a mistake i'm not sure okay
08:40 - anyways that's that part portion
08:41 - let's now go to the sorting aspect uh
08:44 - okay
08:44 - let's randomize randomize can i get some
08:47 - more values okay that's good
08:49 - uh let's select selection sort and let's
08:52 - visualize this
08:54 - okay nice so i can just press the arrow
08:56 - and i can see exactly what's happening
08:57 - in every single step
08:58 - and i guess i can go to the last step in
09:00 - the algorithm and see that okay
09:01 - let's randomize again let's look at
09:04 - quick sort this time
09:06 - okay nice yep looks about right
09:09 - awesome so there's another sorting
09:11 - visualizer suite we can go to the last
09:12 - step there
09:14 - i trust the other ones work very nice uh
09:16 - and i guess what does that do
09:18 - oh remove last element add element okay
09:20 - nice uh minimax visualization
09:23 - so i was looking at this one before i
09:24 - don't quite understand exactly how this
09:26 - works but
09:26 - let's just mess around with and see so i
09:28 - think i can select this
09:29 - and there you go i've placed i guess
09:31 - like the player or the flowers turn i
09:33 - guess has been placed let's place a star
09:35 - okay star goes there i guess it's
09:37 - favoring the flower right i want to call
09:40 - that the flower i don't know if that is
09:42 - right now based on the way that this
09:43 - line is using the many max algorithm
09:45 - okay let's place something
09:48 - i guess right here let's see okay i'm
09:51 - still favored
09:51 - i guess we're gonna have to go here nice
09:54 - go here
09:55 - okay now it looks like it's gonna be a
09:56 - draw game and
09:58 - we can go over here okay here
10:02 - and i guess here and here okay nice uh
10:04 - i'll do it one more time and see if this
10:06 - actually gives it to me if i'm if i do
10:07 - it like incorrectly
10:08 - okay so i'm going to go over here so
10:09 - let's favor me i go here okay
10:11 - i go here and then yes okay it says i'm
10:13 - going to win and i win
10:14 - nice okay awesome so i think that is the
10:16 - entire project another great project
10:19 - really like the ui and kind of you know
10:20 - like the bubble letters and everything
10:21 - it's a different style than what most
10:23 - people go with
10:24 - um so sweet let's move on to the next
10:26 - project all right so this next project
10:28 - is called spotify
10:29 - stats it looks like it's by sand i
10:32 - i
10:33 - apologize if i'm butchering that name
10:34 - senshit maybe uh and arnoff
10:37 - okay awesome so that's spotify stats uh
10:40 - looking at it here it says it can do all
10:41 - of these different things
10:42 - now i swear whoever made this did this
10:44 - just to expose my
10:46 - music taste you guys are going to see
10:47 - what music i listen to now but let me
10:49 - log
10:50 - in here actually do use spotify so this
10:51 - will be a decent i guess
10:53 - app to actually test out here and then
10:55 - once i am signed in i will kind of show
10:57 - you what the website looks like all
10:58 - right so i'm signed into spotify now
11:00 - it's brought up
11:01 - this page and while you guys can already
11:03 - see some of the music that i listen to
11:04 - i'll just quickly state that i'm a very
11:06 - generic music listener if that makes any
11:08 - sense i usually just put on top 50 or
11:10 - whatever the recommended playlists are
11:12 - so don't read too deep into all of these
11:14 - songs anyways you can see here are my
11:16 - top
11:16 - 10 songs go through them okay
11:20 - top artist yes do love john mayer he's
11:22 - great okay you know your your standard
11:24 - artist jack johnson great one too
11:26 - nice nice nice this is actually pretty
11:28 - interesting let's see what else it has
11:29 - here here are your top five genres okay
11:31 - nice rap
11:32 - pop rap pop uh melodic yeah
11:35 - why can't i say that word melodic rap
11:37 - something like that trap okay
11:38 - uh similar artist to john mayer okay
11:41 - jason mraz
11:42 - mostly a bunch of other names i don't
11:44 - know how to pronounce nice nice
11:46 - uh recommended songs for you okay
11:49 - great uh your top song attributes this
11:52 - is interesting i've never actually seen
11:53 - this
11:54 - in like a you know song spotify analysis
11:57 - is pretty unique
11:58 - can i click on this i can download that
11:59 - that's sweet so it looks like they're
12:00 - using the same thing as whatever someone
12:02 - else used to do these kind of graphs
12:04 - and it even tells you what all these
12:05 - things are that's very interesting so i
12:06 - was going to say i don't really know
12:07 - what acousticness actually means
12:09 - um sweet that's very interesting uh some
12:12 - more stats
12:13 - uh longest average shortest tempo and
12:16 - beats per minute
12:17 - highest tempo 188 average 118
12:21 - lowest 71. i don't know how that really
12:23 - compares to everyone else oh this is
12:24 - really cool i like this visualization
12:26 - see how different artists contribute to
12:28 - your top 100 songs
12:30 - damn okay sweet that's really cool uh
12:33 - and
12:33 - thank you for visiting nice yeah this
12:35 - was really cool i'm sure they just
12:36 - pulled this from the spotify api but
12:38 - the way they kind of laid this out in
12:39 - the ui they made for it is really
12:40 - awesome
12:41 - and this is a very interesting project
12:42 - right it's a cool way to actually
12:44 - visualize something that
12:46 - everyone is very very familiar with
12:47 - which is the music that they listen to
12:49 - so great job guys let's move on to the
12:51 - next project so the next project i have
12:54 - here is called
12:54 - physics lab learn physics by visualizing
12:57 - okay
12:58 - very nice the fastest easiest and
12:59 - retainable way of learning physics
13:01 - awesome and let's see who this is by go
13:04 - to insights
13:06 - where is it contributors okay milan090
13:10 - nice i think i remember you from some
13:11 - previous code jams so let's see what
13:14 - your project looks like
13:15 - physics lab okay i haven't actually
13:16 - tried this one yet so let's see
13:18 - learn your physics with physics lab
13:20 - learning physics by visualizing try now
13:22 - all simulators
13:23 - uh newton's cradle gravity trajectory
13:26 - pendulum air resistance friction oh
13:28 - that's really cool okay let's try out a
13:29 - few of these
13:30 - is this the pendulum i guess i can
13:32 - change the gravity
13:34 - oh wow that's really cool what if i make
13:35 - it even okay not zero
13:37 - 0.5 restitution is it bad i don't even
13:41 - know what that means
13:42 - is that like the amount of impact or
13:44 - something maybe uh air friction let's
13:46 - increase that
13:47 - will it eventually stop yeah yeah this
13:49 - is really cool this actually i could
13:51 - genuinely see this being you know used
13:52 - in a classroom assuming that all the
13:54 - physics here are correct and i'm not
13:55 - necessarily questioning those
13:56 - uh graph view oh that's cool it's like a
13:59 - sinusoidal kind of wave going on that's
14:01 - i did they have than the other one i
14:02 - don't know that's that's really cool
14:03 - though and i can mess with all of these
14:05 - i can see how the graph actually changes
14:08 - wow that's very interesting
14:09 - uh air resistance oh okay so i guess
14:12 - this
14:13 - oh that's neat i can like make it fall
14:15 - okay let's make the air resistance like
14:16 - crazy high
14:18 - damn okay gravity increase
14:21 - simulation nice box size can change the
14:24 - mass of it
14:26 - this means gonna like bounce or
14:28 - something if i do that no i still don't
14:29 - know what restitution means
14:31 - i guess i'm just not a physics nerd okay
14:33 - anyways try something else let's go to
14:34 - the next simulator let's try gravity
14:37 - um oh is this like stuff is in an orbit
14:40 - around this am i
14:43 - maybe maybe oh yeah it looks like it
14:46 - yeah it looks like this is like a space
14:47 - orbit or something going on uh one thing
14:50 - i'll say is oh
14:50 - that that's cool planets count yeah okay
14:52 - so it'd be nice if there was kind of
14:53 - like a description of what was going on
14:55 - here
14:55 - because if this is like to learn physics
14:57 - it'd be interesting if they at least you
14:58 - know like define these terms but
14:59 - regardless this is still really cool
15:01 - math formula okay and that makes sense
15:03 - because the more objects that go close
15:05 - to the center the more mass it has
15:06 - nice nice uh okay let's try trajectory
15:10 - this one is cool i actually messed with
15:12 - trajectory in a few projects i worked on
15:14 - uh so i can definitely relate to this
15:15 - one so can i like pull this back and
15:17 - shoot it or something
15:19 - um oh there you go okay i have to it's
15:22 - kind of a weird trigger mechanism
15:24 - oh nice that's really interesting
15:25 - awesome and then graph view ah okay
15:27 - that's cool so it shows me i guess the
15:29 - displacement at a certain oh no the
15:31 - velocity at a certain time
15:32 - awesome and then the last one we have is
15:35 - friction
15:36 - okay so just a box sliding down a ramp
15:39 - let's increase the friction
15:41 - and make it even more see if we can make
15:44 - it so it stays stationary
15:46 - yeah okay so when the friction is one it
15:48 - like barely moves
15:49 - nice and i can increase the angle let's
15:51 - try that
15:53 - very nice okay definitely a super
15:55 - impressive project i want to know how he
15:57 - implemented all of these physics here
15:58 - because that is really cool
15:59 - and like i said the only real critique i
16:01 - would have for this one is since it says
16:02 - you know
16:02 - learning physics it would be cool if you
16:04 - actually put some learning attribute in
16:06 - here because it is cool to mess around
16:07 - with this
16:08 - stuff but if i don't know what the terms
16:09 - mean it's uh you know not not very
16:10 - useful to me
16:12 - anyways let's move on to the next
16:13 - project all right so the next project i
16:15 - have here is called a flex
16:17 - chart now this is by zen yu han
16:20 - or han not sure you say that and then
16:22 - tony z
16:23 - now let's actually go to the project all
16:26 - right so it says graph the present
16:28 - change the future nice nice like that
16:30 - slogan tagline whatever you want to call
16:32 - it
16:32 - uh so i already signed in here so i'm
16:34 - with my account so i can sign out by
16:36 - pressing that
16:36 - so it says the modern data visualization
16:39 - tool let's read the about page
16:40 - there are many features that make
16:42 - graphing data is much simpler you can
16:43 - graph your own data
16:44 - is this a word data with a plural maybe
16:46 - i'm maybe i'm just crazy but i feel like
16:48 - this is like not proper this doesn't
16:49 - sound proper
16:50 - you can insert spreadsheet it will give
16:51 - you graph graph it will get graphed
16:54 - automatically
16:54 - you can even see all the trend topics
16:56 - okay nice let's go back
16:58 - let's look at some trends first let's
17:00 - look at covet 19 data
17:02 - okay so this is the global view active
17:05 - cases in millions by day
17:07 - nice nice uh let's go to canada
17:12 - sweet okay so confirmed uh one one two
17:15 - seven dot zero is this in oh it's in
17:17 - thousands okay that makes sense
17:19 - recovered critical deaths
17:22 - let's go to united states
17:26 - u.s usa okay and you can see there's
17:29 - quite a bit more than canada let's go to
17:32 - programming languages
17:33 - python yes on top as always
17:36 - java javascript sounds about right out
17:38 - okay they give the source
17:39 - awesome i was just going to question i
17:40 - don't know where that comes from ide
17:42 - ranking
17:43 - nice same source uh visual studio code
17:46 - right in the middle there that's what
17:47 - i've been using where's sublime text i
17:49 - guess that's not considered an ide
17:50 - okay databases oracle mysql
17:53 - sql server nice nice anime i don't know
17:56 - what any of these are
17:57 - websites youtube yep sounds about right
18:00 - awesome and facebook's still second
18:02 - place eh
18:02 - or this isn't is it looks like wikipedia
18:05 - is higher than facebook but it's not
18:06 - higher on the graph
18:07 - so i wonder why that's the case but
18:09 - regardless i'm
18:10 - kind of surprised that facebook is still
18:12 - the second largest website used
18:14 - but uh i guess that makes sense okay you
18:16 - know what let's go to my own projects
18:17 - actually
18:18 - projects i mean i can view that one or i
18:20 - can create a new project let's do that
18:23 - let's say test okay let's view
18:27 - so i have an empty graph here i don't oh
18:29 - i can change the type of the graph nice
18:31 - line bar
18:32 - pi let's make it a pie graph let's load
18:35 - i don't have any data to load let me
18:37 - type in some data
18:38 - so i don't see here's the thing i'm not
18:40 - sure if these are supposed to be like
18:42 - labels or like i'm just inserting like x
18:44 - y or something
18:46 - um let's see here two
18:49 - three two four
18:53 - five six i know i'm 100 doing this
18:56 - strong okay so those are the labels okay
18:57 - so that makes sense
18:58 - so i can say tim
19:02 - and let's change that to be bill
19:06 - and let's change that to be joe okay so
19:08 - two four
19:10 - six and i can put some label here so i
19:13 - don't know let's say
19:14 - great good
19:18 - fun or something okay uh joe
19:22 - tim bill let's go three
19:26 - four five six
19:31 - eight seven i know this makes no sense
19:33 - i'm just trying to test the graphing
19:34 - thing and see if it works
19:35 - okay it does work looks good let's go to
19:37 - bar okay nice
19:39 - nice nice line sweet is giving me
19:41 - multiple lines okay this makes a lot
19:43 - more sense now i wasn't quite sure
19:44 - exactly what i was supposed to insert
19:46 - compared to the other ones that they had
19:48 - sweet i mean i don't think i really need
19:49 - to test this much more i mean this looks
19:50 - great the graph looks awesome
19:52 - seems like you guys are using a similar
19:53 - one to what everyone else has been using
19:55 - i guess i can add like a sub project in
19:56 - here let's say
19:57 - you know sub okay and yes so now it
20:00 - looks like there's a project
20:01 - inside of this test project unless oh no
20:03 - these are just all different projects
20:04 - and this is the active one
20:06 - that's highlighted in green awesome so
20:08 - i'm going to
20:09 - delete this project here that works
20:12 - sweet and with that said that's going to
20:13 - conclude the five
20:14 - projects now before i actually get into
20:16 - ranking them i'll just quickly say that
20:17 - these are super impressive
20:19 - and even if i'm giving you guys
20:20 - criticism it's very like i'm trying to
20:22 - come up with something wrong with it
20:23 - essentially
20:23 - uh these are great they look awesome
20:25 - great work to everyone who submitted a
20:27 - project i did look at a few that weren't
20:29 - in the top five as well
20:30 - anyways now let's get into the top three
20:33 - projects
20:34 - all right so now we're gonna get into
20:35 - the top three projects first i just want
20:37 - to address kind of fourth and fifth
20:38 - place or fifth and fourth place there's
20:40 - really no order for these two projects
20:41 - that didn't make it into the top three
20:43 - and those two projects are physics lab
20:46 - and
20:46 - figurify now i just want to tell you
20:48 - guys you did an awesome job i was
20:49 - genuinely very impressed by both of
20:51 - these projects
20:52 - and the only real feedback i have for
20:53 - you guys is that i just felt this wasn't
20:55 - super unique super creative
20:57 - for example physics lab i feel like you
20:58 - kind of did the same thing six
21:00 - times nothing wrong with that but it
21:02 - just wasn't something that necessarily
21:03 - kind of stood out as much as the other
21:05 - projects where i felt they had
21:06 - a little bit more uniqueness to what
21:08 - they did and then what i'm talking about
21:10 - figurify here
21:11 - this one same thing really well done i
21:13 - liked the ui decision you kind of went
21:14 - with something different than what most
21:16 - people are doing nowadays
21:17 - um the data visualization was
21:19 - interesting by the same time sorting
21:20 - visualizer this is kind of done
21:22 - all over the internet now not super
21:23 - creative or unique and the mini max i
21:25 - thought was a really good idea i thought
21:27 - that could have had a lot of potential
21:29 - but with tic-tac-toe i just thought it
21:30 - was a little bit too simple
21:31 - simple sorry for me to really appreciate
21:33 - uh what went into actually doing that so
21:35 - either way good job guys hope to see you
21:37 - again in the next code gym
21:38 - please don't be discouraged by any of my
21:40 - comments as i said i am just literally
21:42 - trying to come up with things that are
21:43 - wrong with these projects because you
21:44 - guys did an
21:45 - awesome job all right so now we are
21:47 - moving on to the top three projects what
21:49 - you guys have been
21:51 - waiting for now all three of these
21:52 - projects did a really good job honestly
21:54 - it's really hard for me to pick between
21:56 - these projects even this top five
21:58 - like the reason i'm picking projects is
21:59 - not anything you know super major big
22:01 - difference it's generally just my
22:03 - subjective opinion of what i liked
22:05 - better
22:05 - and with that said the third place
22:07 - project the third place
22:09 - team i have for us is flex chart now
22:12 - flex chart you guys did an
22:13 - awesome job i thought this was pretty
22:15 - well done i know you guys put a lot of
22:16 - work into this website
22:18 - even created a lot of these kind of
22:19 - trending ones which i really appreciated
22:21 - because it allowed me to not have to go
22:23 - in and put all of my data
22:24 - i could actually really see what the
22:25 - program was capable of doing
22:27 - and then uh like even just the ui design
22:30 - you kept it simple but it was nice
22:31 - everything worked well and of course
22:33 - when i went and
22:34 - actually graphed the data no bugs no
22:36 - problems i wish potentially maybe you
22:38 - had started with some data in there just
22:40 - so it was easy to see
22:41 - exactly how you're supposed to input the
22:43 - data and yeah i just thought you guys
22:45 - did a good job but
22:46 - i felt the other ones were maybe a
22:48 - little bit more unique had a little bit
22:49 - more work put into them and well that is
22:50 - why you guys
22:51 - came third place so regardless
22:53 - congratulations i'll be reaching out to
22:54 - you on discord to send you
22:56 - your prize so congrats once more and now
22:59 - let's announce
22:59 - second and first place so the second
23:02 - place
23:02 - team i have here is spotify stats
23:06 - now i didn't think this project was
23:07 - super impressive in terms of a
23:09 - programming side
23:10 - i know what you guys did is you really
23:11 - just went to the spotify api
23:13 - you pulled a bunch of information and
23:15 - you visualize it on the screen
23:16 - however this is the one project that
23:18 - when i was using i was like i would
23:20 - actually use this i don't really care
23:22 - how simple it actually is
23:24 - but the visualization was really nice it
23:26 - was really easy to see
23:27 - it was a quick you know 31 minutes it
23:30 - was a quick you know 30 second to a
23:32 - minute long kind of read of the page and
23:34 - it gave me actually a really kind of
23:35 - interesting overview of all of the
23:37 - artists that i listened to
23:38 - all of the music that i like and some
23:40 - interesting recommendations as well so
23:42 - again i know this wasn't technically
23:43 - super complicated to do
23:45 - but i just appreciated that this was
23:47 - something that i would actually use and
23:49 - i'm sure a lot of people that are
23:50 - watching this video
23:51 - will probably go click on so that they
23:52 - can actually see uh their kind of
23:54 - spotify trends and stats and so
23:56 - that is why i picked this as second
23:58 - place so congratulations guys
23:59 - awesome idea and yeah i will be reaching
24:01 - out to you on discord so you can collect
24:03 - your promise so of course
24:04 - that leaves first place as realize
24:08 - now realize i think it's pretty
24:09 - straightforward why i picked this you
24:10 - guys just had the most amount of
24:11 - features i think you have the most
24:13 - amount of things to visualize
24:14 - i thought that everything here was just
24:16 - done very well everything felt
24:18 - really polished with the exception of i
24:19 - think one small thing that didn't go
24:21 - exactly as i was expecting
24:23 - everything worked it was very intuitive
24:24 - it was easy to use didn't really need to
24:26 - read a lot of the instructions if i
24:27 - didn't need to read the instructions
24:28 - they were clear and easy to see
24:30 - and yeah i just felt like this was
24:32 - really polished really well finished and
24:34 - again
24:34 - just like in a lot of the other code
24:35 - jams when i see these types of websites
24:38 - these remind me of something that wasn't
24:40 - made in a code jam right like if you had
24:41 - showed this to me and just say
24:42 - oh this is a cool website you can use to
24:44 - visualize something i would just believe
24:46 - that i wouldn't have thought this was a
24:47 - hobby project done by one person
24:49 - so anyways that is kind of my rationale
24:51 - i hope you guys enjoyed this video
24:53 - congratulations again to all of the
24:55 - teams and to everyone who participated
24:56 - in the code gem i hope at minimum you
24:58 - guys learned something
24:59 - you enjoyed your time working on a
25:01 - project and i hope to see you all in the
25:02 - next ones
25:03 - with that said make sure you guys sign
25:04 - up for the next code gem or at least
25:07 - join my discord server so you'll be
25:08 - aware of when it starts again link in
25:10 - the description to all of that
25:11 - information
25:12 - with that said if you enjoyed make sure
25:13 - to leave a like subscribe to the channel
25:15 - i will see you in another youtube video
