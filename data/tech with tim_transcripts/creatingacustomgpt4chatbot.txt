00:03 - foreign
00:08 - I'll show you how to create a custom
00:11 - gpt4 powered chatbot that can respond to
00:14 - tweets questions really any textual data
00:17 - and in any format or personality that
00:20 - you like so you can create a fully
00:22 - custom chatbot here that is fully your
00:24 - own and is completely different than
00:25 - anything that I might make or anyone
00:27 - else watching this video so let me give
00:29 - you a quick demo of an example of a live
00:31 - chatbot that's kind of using the
00:33 - strategy that we're going to deploy in
00:35 - this video and you'll get a sense for
00:37 - what I mean so you can see that there's
00:38 - a Twitter account here called snoopsteen
00:40 - now this is a chat bot this is not
00:42 - someone actively running the account and
00:44 - anytime you tweet at this account or
00:46 - hashtag the name so snoopsteen it
00:49 - automatically responds to your comment
00:51 - now if we look here
00:53 - we can see that we have some tweets so
00:56 - for example you can see he's responding
00:58 - to someone dear whoever tweeted at him
00:59 - yo listen up it's time to Feast whatever
01:02 - this is jakarti Munchen on a Chick-fil-A
01:05 - a mini breakfast Beast
01:07 - Etc I'm not going to read through all
01:08 - the tweets they're kind of funny but
01:09 - this chatbot is in the kind of
01:11 - personality of Albert Einstein combined
01:14 - with Snoop Dogg so you get the knowledge
01:16 - of Einstein but kind of the rhyming and
01:19 - responses that Snoop Dogg might have and
01:21 - this is just a very simple example of
01:23 - the type of chatbot you could create you
01:25 - could do ones in different kinds of
01:26 - personalities you could have ones that
01:28 - are answering as if they're living in
01:29 - like the 1500s or as if they're an alien
01:32 - you can do really interesting stuff here
01:34 - obviously you don't have to host it on
01:35 - Twitter but if you want to mess with
01:37 - this existing chat bot then just go to
01:39 - this Twitter account at Snoop underscore
01:41 - Steen uh tweet at it or hashtag the name
01:44 - and then it will actually automatically
01:45 - respond to you within a few minutes all
01:48 - right so that's kind of an example of
01:49 - what we're going to be making again you
01:50 - could host your chatbot wherever you
01:52 - want once you have it it's super easy to
01:54 - use it and you can kind of put it in any
01:56 - format that you like so before we go any
01:58 - further I'll quickly mention that I'm
01:59 - going to be following this guide right
02:01 - here which is actually people that
02:02 - created the Snoop Stein chat bot this
02:05 - walks you through everything you need to
02:06 - do to create the chatbot as well as to
02:08 - host it on Twitter I'm not going to host
02:10 - on Twitter in this video but I'll show
02:12 - you everything in terms of getting the
02:13 - chatbot up and running using the chat
02:15 - bot querying the chatbot responses and
02:17 - then you can deploy it how you see fit
02:19 - so if you want to follow the guide click
02:21 - the link in the description and now
02:22 - let's move on to step one where we start
02:24 - creating this bot so for this video I am
02:27 - going to be using a platform called
02:28 - mindsdb now mindsdb allows you to import
02:32 - your existing data into their platform
02:34 - and train machine learning models quite
02:36 - literally in the matter of seconds using
02:39 - SQL syntax now I'm going to explain more
02:41 - about how this works but I do need to
02:43 - disclose that I am partnered with
02:44 - minesdb they have sponsored this video
02:46 - however this is completely free I'm not
02:49 - trying to sell you anything this really
02:51 - is just a revolutionary platform
02:52 - something that I've never seen before
02:54 - and I wanted to show it to you guys
02:56 - because I know you can get a ton of
02:57 - value and very quickly actually use AI
03:00 - models that before might have been a bit
03:02 - intimidating to you so with mindsdb as I
03:05 - was saying you import your data and then
03:06 - you write some SQL syntax which I know
03:08 - sounds really strange I'll explain that
03:10 - to you more in a second that actually
03:11 - creates what's known as an AI table for
03:14 - you now this AI table acts just like a
03:17 - normal database table and allows you to
03:19 - use normal SQL queries like select
03:22 - whatever field you want from this table
03:24 - to get predictions and to use your
03:27 - machine learning model and then you can
03:28 - connect to the SQL database just like
03:31 - you would connect to any other SQL
03:32 - database and use it from a front end
03:34 - from a back end from any kind of project
03:36 - that you want which I'm going to show
03:37 - you later in the video so if I scroll
03:39 - down here you can see that this is
03:41 - what's required to create a model create
03:43 - model sentiment classifier predict
03:45 - sentiment using this engine task model
03:48 - name input column
03:49 - Etc that's it you just pick the model
03:51 - you want already built into mines DB it
03:54 - will then train based on the data that
03:56 - you pass it then you will have an AI
03:58 - table and then you use that AI table to
04:00 - make predictions here if we look at time
04:02 - series again you can see obviously we
04:04 - can adjust the different input data and
04:06 - different parameters for the model you
04:08 - can get as complicated or as simple as
04:10 - you want but I'm going to show you that
04:12 - we're literally going to make this gpt4
04:14 - model in like two or three SQL
04:17 - statements now obviously you can
04:18 - integrate with all your existing data
04:20 - too if you're not making a chat bot you
04:21 - might be making something else so like
04:23 - you know MySQL Oracle open AI you have
04:26 - mongodb really any data source even
04:29 - Google Sheets you can kind of import
04:30 - into mind CB and start messing with all
04:33 - right so that's enough of kind of the
04:34 - explanation of this platform let's dive
04:36 - in the first thing we need to do is
04:38 - create an account so I already have one
04:39 - I'm just going to sign in for you guys
04:41 - just go to this website mindcb.com
04:43 - create a new account and then you'll be
04:45 - brought into this Cloud editor where
04:47 - we'll start working alright so after
04:49 - you've created an account and gone
04:50 - through the setup steps you should be
04:51 - brought to a page here where you have a
04:53 - demo instance now I'm going to click
04:55 - into mine here obviously you can create
04:57 - other ones if you upgrade to Pro but you
04:59 - don't need to do that for this video and
05:01 - you can see that you have kind of a
05:03 - built-in SQL editor here and I'll zoom
05:04 - in a little bit just so it's easier to
05:06 - read we can get rid of kind of the
05:08 - Learning Hub on the side now this is
05:11 - where we can write all of our SQL as
05:13 - well as connect to different databases
05:15 - and start creating our models so on the
05:17 - left hand side you can see that we
05:18 - already have two databases we have the
05:20 - mycb database and then the files
05:22 - database which doesn't have anything
05:24 - inside of it currently which is fine now
05:26 - what we can do is connect to different
05:27 - data sources by going to add data and we
05:29 - can connect to mongodb mySQL postgres
05:32 - etc etc there's a ton of different data
05:34 - sources we have access to and then we
05:36 - can add different machine learning
05:38 - models here if we want now we're not
05:39 - going to do that that's a bit more
05:40 - advanced what we're going to do is just
05:42 - use existing models here alright so the
05:44 - first thing I'm going to do here is just
05:46 - show you how to create a basic machine
05:47 - learning model then we will continue and
05:49 - improve it and make it better so I'm
05:51 - going to paste in a block of code here
05:53 - I'll look explain this to you but feel
05:55 - free to pause the video and type it out
05:56 - or you can go to the link in the
05:59 - description for the guide that I'm
06:00 - following for this video and it will
06:01 - have this exact same code so it says
06:04 - create model mindcb.gpt underscore model
06:07 - we're predicting a response so that's
06:09 - kind of the output column we're going to
06:11 - get using the engine of openai the model
06:14 - name of gpd4 and then the prompt
06:16 - template now the prompt template is
06:19 - essentially telling us what kind of data
06:21 - we need to feed to the model when we're
06:23 - making a prediction and how we're going
06:24 - to respond to it so we're saying we want
06:26 - to respond to some kind of text which is
06:28 - a variable we're going to have to pass
06:30 - when we make a prediction by the author
06:32 - username which again is another variable
06:34 - very very simple I'm going to show you
06:35 - how this works in one second for now
06:37 - though let's simply run the code now
06:40 - notice here that you don't have to pass
06:41 - any API key or anything like that by
06:43 - default when you're using this demo
06:45 - instance it's automatically going to
06:47 - have an API key for openai for you which
06:50 - gives you access to gbd4 which is
06:52 - currently under kind of early release so
06:54 - you can see here that we get GPD model
06:56 - openai myzb we can see that it's
06:59 - currently generating and if we want to
07:01 - check the status of this model then we
07:03 - can type in the following line I think
07:06 - I'm just going to have to fix this a
07:07 - little bit
07:08 - so select asterisks from minesdb model
07:10 - where the name equals GPT model if I run
07:15 - this then notice that I get the status
07:16 - is complete okay so I'm just querying
07:19 - essentially the model we just created
07:21 - now if we go here to minesdb this
07:23 - database you can see the inside of here
07:24 - we now have an AI table which is our GPT
07:27 - model and now we can query this GPT
07:30 - model just like we would query any
07:31 - normal table and we will be able to get
07:34 - a response from it so to do that we're
07:36 - going to use the following line let me
07:38 - copy this in here so select response
07:42 - from mindcb.gpd underscore model where
07:45 - the author username is equal to mycb you
07:48 - could obviously change this maybe we'll
07:49 - do
07:50 - Tech with Tim and the text is why is
07:53 - gravity so different on the sun again
07:55 - you can change that to whatever you want
07:57 - and you're just going to get a gpt4
07:58 - generated response so let's run this
08:02 - and we can see here that it's going to
08:04 - take a few seconds this is because right
08:06 - now open AI is heavily rate limited so
08:08 - it could take 10 20 30 seconds to get a
08:11 - response obviously later on this should
08:13 - be faster if you pass your own API key
08:15 - it should be a bit quicker than using
08:17 - the default one regardless you can see
08:19 - that we've queried the response right
08:20 - selecting the response so now we get a
08:23 - column which is our response and it says
08:25 - gravity is so different on the sun
08:26 - compared to Earth blah blah blah blah I
08:28 - won't read through it but this is the
08:30 - response we got for this query okay so
08:34 - hopefully that makes sense but that's as
08:36 - easy as it is to create a model and then
08:39 - use the model by selecting from the
08:42 - table again we're selecting the column
08:44 - that we want there could be multiple
08:45 - columns in this case it's just one from
08:48 - the mycbgpt model where and then we pass
08:50 - the two variables that we required in
08:52 - that kind of prompt statement
08:55 - okay so that is the basics on how mind
08:57 - CB works again I'm sure that this is not
09:00 - quite Crystal Clear yet but as we go
09:01 - into this next example you'll see how we
09:03 - can make something a bit more custom So
09:05 - currently we have a GPT model but this
09:08 - is not really chat bot ready right it's
09:10 - just giving us whatever response would
09:12 - happen from open AI we want to have a
09:15 - more custom model that has a personality
09:17 - that's speaking in a certain tone of
09:18 - voice
09:19 - Etc so let me copy in a new block here
09:23 - it's going to create a more custom model
09:25 - for us and I think I need to just fix
09:29 - something here with the quotations okay
09:32 - so let's make this a bit smaller so we
09:34 - can read all this
09:35 - we are saying create model
09:38 - mindsdb.snoopstein model now we can
09:40 - rename this but this is the one that was
09:41 - used in the guide so I'm just pasting it
09:43 - in for right now again we want to
09:45 - predict some kind of response using and
09:48 - then the engine is equal to open AI the
09:50 - max tokens is 300 which is the max
09:53 - number of kind of input that we can give
09:55 - to this uh this model then we can have
09:57 - an open AI API key again we don't need
10:00 - that there'll be a default one provided
10:02 - to us we have the model name and then
10:04 - the prompt template now is different The
10:06 - Prompt template is essentially what
10:07 - we're passing two open AI when it's
10:10 - going to make the prediction right so
10:12 - it's going to take our input message
10:13 - which is the text from the author
10:16 - username and then whatever we describe
10:18 - here it's going to do so in this case
10:20 - we're saying in less than 550 characters
10:22 - write a Twitter response to the author
10:25 - username in the following format dear at
10:28 - whatever the username is respond a rhyme
10:31 - as if you were Snoop Dogg but also we're
10:32 - as smart as Albert Einstein still
10:34 - explain things like Snoop Dog do not
10:36 - mention that you are part Einstein okay
10:37 - so there you go this is giving the
10:39 - description for The Voice or like the
10:41 - tone of the AI so we can change this and
10:43 - we can also make it so it's not
10:45 - necessarily responding to a tweet maybe
10:47 - we want to respond to a website message
10:49 - or something else right so you can kind
10:50 - of adjust this however you want so give
10:52 - me one second I'm going to write my own
10:54 - kind of custom prompt here and then we
10:56 - will continue alright so I've just
10:58 - written a new prompt here where I say
10:59 - respond in less than 150 words to the
11:01 - text from the author username in the
11:03 - following format greetings whatever the
11:05 - author is respond as if you're an alien
11:08 - from the future that is wiser smarter
11:10 - and more intellectual than the person
11:12 - asking you a question openly judge the
11:14 - stupidity of the question and mock the
11:16 - person asking it make sure to still give
11:18 - the correct answer do not swear or be
11:20 - inappropriate for the YouTube video now
11:23 - I'll actually change the name here to be
11:24 - the alien model I thought this would be
11:27 - kind of funny but you get the idea you
11:28 - can kind of create whatever type of Bot
11:30 - you want by writing in how you want the
11:33 - bot to respond or what you want it to do
11:34 - you can be asked creative here as you
11:36 - like so let's run this
11:39 - and you can see that now we're going to
11:40 - start generating this model again if we
11:43 - wanted to check the status we could
11:44 - select it so if I go here select
11:46 - asterisk from my CB model right so we
11:48 - could copy that
11:49 - take this and paste it in and notice
11:53 - here that it's going to tell us the
11:54 - status let me move this up a bit and the
11:57 - status is complete so now let's ask the
12:00 - model the exact same question that we
12:02 - asked the other one and see what kind of
12:04 - difference and response we get all right
12:06 - so I've just pasted in the query here
12:08 - let's run this and see what response we
12:12 - get here from our alien model all right
12:14 - so we've got our response here feel free
12:15 - to read through it I'll just read the
12:16 - first paragraph greetings some user oh
12:19 - how quaint and primitive your
12:20 - understanding of celestial mechanics
12:21 - must be is quite amusing really
12:23 - nevertheless I shall Enlighten you on
12:26 - the matter feel free to keep reading but
12:28 - already we can see that it's kind of got
12:29 - the gist of what I was asking it to do
12:31 - and now we have a custom chatbot alright
12:34 - so now you might be wondering how do we
12:36 - actually use this chatbot well if you've
12:39 - continued with that guide that I've
12:40 - Linked In the description it's going to
12:42 - show you the steps to actually deploy
12:44 - this to Twitter now I don't want to put
12:46 - this on Twitter because I don't want to
12:47 - chatbot running on my Twitter I don't
12:49 - want to make one you guys can do that if
12:51 - you want there's a few steps again from
12:53 - that guide but I will show you now how
12:55 - we would say get some different tweets
12:57 - and then use those tweets to generate
13:00 - responses so we're going to essentially
13:02 - join this um kind of query with all of
13:06 - the different tweets or different
13:07 - textual things we might want to respond
13:09 - to to get multiple responses at once so
13:12 - I'll show you that and then I'm going to
13:14 - show you how we can use this from say a
13:16 - python script so you can actually get
13:18 - outside of this kind of mindsdb editor
13:20 - and still be able to use your trained
13:22 - model alright so first thing I need to
13:24 - do here because I want to show you how
13:25 - we connect this with Twitter is I'm
13:27 - going to create a new database and this
13:29 - is going to contain all of the tweets
13:31 - from the mindsdb Twitter account that's
13:34 - just because we're in kind of the demo
13:36 - instance so it automatically has
13:37 - authorization for that if you wanted to
13:39 - get your own tweets then you would have
13:41 - to connect to Twitter by going here to
13:43 - add data and you have to give like read
13:45 - access I think from a Twitter developer
13:47 - account it's a bit more complicated
13:49 - again and it's kind of mentioned in that
13:51 - guide I'm not going to run through it in
13:52 - the video because I know a lot of you
13:53 - don't want to do that where you can't
13:55 - actually follow along with the steps so
13:57 - I'm going to say create database from my
13:58 - Twitter with engine equals Twitter
14:00 - okay let's do that so now you can see we
14:02 - have our Twitter database now that we
14:04 - have that we want to view a bunch of
14:06 - different tweets now I'm just going to
14:08 - use the query that the guide has here
14:10 - and what this essentially does is select
14:13 - all of the tweets that mention the
14:16 - snoopsteen bot okay so this is exactly
14:18 - what they did to make that bot they said
14:20 - select the ID created at author username
14:22 - text from my twitter.tweets which is a
14:25 - table we have inside of here where the
14:28 - query is equal to and then this is a
14:30 - query that you can write based on the
14:32 - Twitter API again not going to get into
14:35 - that too much essentially we're querying
14:37 - looking for any of these ads or any of
14:39 - these hashtags and the fact that we have
14:41 - some retweet we're also going to make
14:43 - sure that this was created after this
14:45 - date and we're limiting the result to
14:48 - 20. so if I run this here
14:50 - uh we get a bad request start time must
14:52 - be after this date okay let me just
14:54 - change this to be one day forward and
14:56 - notice if I make this a bit larger then
15:00 - we now get a bunch of tweets gives us
15:01 - the time they're created the ID the
15:03 - author username and then what all the
15:05 - tweets are and they all have the at
15:07 - snoopsteen um what do you call it filter
15:09 - applied to them right so we're only
15:11 - getting those ones okay so now that
15:14 - we've gotten all of these what we could
15:16 - do is join this response or join this
15:18 - result with our model table and then get
15:22 - a response to every single one of the
15:24 - tweets that mentions this button so let
15:26 - me show you how we would do that all
15:27 - right so I've just pasted in another SQL
15:29 - query here notice that we're just
15:31 - selecting all of the stuff that we need
15:33 - from our Twitter uh our tweets table
15:36 - we're calling this table T by the way
15:37 - that's why we have that here we're then
15:39 - saying join minesdb dot in this case
15:41 - it's going to be our alien model because
15:43 - that's what I called it if you change
15:45 - your name you would change it here and
15:47 - since we're using the Mind CB Twitter
15:48 - account I'm just going to keep this
15:49 - filter so we're going to imagine that
15:51 - anyone who tagged snoopsteen really was
15:53 - referencing our alien bot here and I'm
15:55 - just going to change this created that
15:56 - date to be 22. for some reason we need
15:59 - to um we can only query tweets within
16:01 - like the past week which is why we need
16:03 - this and in this case I'm limiting the
16:05 - number of responses to four so again
16:07 - we're joining two different tables so we
16:09 - have the one table that has all of our
16:11 - responses or sorry all of our like
16:13 - original tweets and then we're gonna
16:15 - join that with a query to our AI table
16:17 - which will then generate all of the
16:19 - responses to all of those tweets so
16:22 - let's make this a bit larger and let's
16:24 - run this it's going to take a few
16:26 - seconds to get all of the results here
16:28 - uh just because again open AI is like
16:30 - very heavily rate limited right now and
16:32 - it can be pretty slow alright so finally
16:34 - we have generated some responses you can
16:36 - see that we have the input text here so
16:38 - for example sub4sub YouTube channels
16:40 - follow for follow and then it comes here
16:42 - greetings Earthling obviously it's our
16:44 - alien bot now and it goes in and
16:47 - responds so I think that's pretty much
16:49 - all I needed to show you in terms of
16:51 - creating the AI model using the AI model
16:54 - now what I want to show you is how we
16:55 - get outside of this platform and use
16:58 - this safe from code because this is
17:00 - great and all but if you wanted to
17:01 - deploy this somewhere obviously you need
17:02 - to hook into this model and use it from
17:05 - some kind of front end or back end or
17:07 - wherever it is that you're going to use
17:08 - it so what I'm going to do now is open
17:09 - up a python file and show you very quick
17:12 - quickly how we can connect to our
17:14 - instance here and use this AI table that
17:17 - we've generated all right so I've just
17:18 - loaded up a python file here I've
17:20 - already written the code just to save us
17:22 - some time you can see that what I'm
17:23 - doing is I'm using my SQL connector now
17:26 - this is a module in Python that allows
17:28 - you to connect to a SQL database I also
17:31 - am then loading an environment variable
17:32 - file just so I don't share with you what
17:34 - my username and my password is but
17:36 - notice that all I need to do is have
17:37 - information about the host which is my
17:39 - cloud.mycb.com my user which is simply
17:42 - the email that you use for your mysdb
17:45 - account the password same thing it's the
17:46 - password that you used and then the port
17:48 - which is always going to be 3306 then I
17:51 - create what's known as a cursor object
17:53 - this is just how you execute queries
17:55 - when you're using the MySQL library and
17:58 - then I say cursor.execute and I execute
18:00 - the same SQL query that I did on the
18:03 - cloud here from python so select
18:06 - response from minesdb.alien model where
18:09 - the author username is mycb and the text
18:12 - is who is the best YouTuber now you can
18:14 - put whatever text you want here and
18:16 - obviously you could dynamically generate
18:17 - this and create like kind of a chat bot
18:19 - prompt here in your terminal if you
18:21 - wanted to do that then what I need to do
18:23 - is Loop through my cursor because it's
18:25 - actually an iterable object you can
18:28 - parse this in a few different ways but
18:30 - for now I'm just doing it very simply
18:31 - and it's going to give us the response
18:33 - so to prove to you that this works
18:36 - I'm gonna go here and run my code
18:39 - Python
18:40 - main.pi and you'll see that in a few
18:43 - seconds it's going to generate a
18:44 - response for me based on this prompt who
18:47 - is the best YouTuber so there you go we
18:48 - got our response greetings earthlings my
18:50 - CB your inquiry about the best YouTuber
18:52 - is quite amusing as it demonstrates the
18:53 - limited scope of your intellect and our
18:55 - Advanced future we have transcended Such
18:57 - trivial matters however I shall indulge
18:59 - your primitive curiosity the concept of
19:01 - best is subjective and varies from
19:02 - Individual to individual blah blah blah
19:05 - you get the idea farewell Earthling so
19:08 - obviously you can read through this
19:09 - response on your own you can parse it
19:11 - you can do whatever you want with it but
19:12 - the idea is that now we've gone from the
19:14 - cloud to our actual code I've shown you
19:16 - that in what 18 lines of code we're able
19:18 - to actually connect to that AI model
19:19 - query it and use it and even though we
19:22 - might not treat that as like a
19:23 - production model it's pretty close for
19:25 - what we're doing here so with that said
19:27 - I think I'm going to wrap up the video
19:29 - now obviously what I showed you is
19:31 - really just the tip of the iceberg when
19:33 - it comes to using mindsdb and creating
19:35 - machine learning models you can do all
19:37 - kinds of amazing stuff with your own
19:39 - data on my CB like regression
19:41 - classification more advanced models
19:44 - predictions anything that you can
19:46 - imagine you can pretty much create on
19:47 - there they have all kinds of very easy
19:49 - to understand documentation and
19:51 - tutorials directly on the website so I
19:53 - encourage you to follow along with those
19:55 - I hope you guys enjoyed this video and
19:57 - you got some knowledge and value on how
20:00 - easy it is to actually use stuff like
20:01 - open Ai and gpt4 and how you can take
20:04 - advantage of that in your own projects
20:06 - if you guys enjoyed make sure to leave a
20:08 - like subscribe the channel and I will
20:09 - see you in another one
