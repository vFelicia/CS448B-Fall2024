00:00 - now this is pretty straightforward and
00:02 - intuitive but we want to make sure that
00:03 - whenever we're writing code we're
00:05 - thinking about how we can make this code
00:06 - AS reusable as possible rather than
00:09 - writing say a super specific function
00:10 - that does one thing really well but only
00:13 - works in maybe one specific
00:14 - implementation maybe we spend a little
00:16 - bit of time and make it a bit more
00:17 - General so we allow it to be reused in
00:19 - different contexts right oftentimes
00:21 - you're making a small sacrifice up front
00:23 - so that later on your code is a lot more
00:26 - reusable and you're saving a ton of time
00:28 - because now you don't have to go back
00:29 - and understand this code rewrite this
00:32 - code you're going to thank yourself
00:33 - because the code you wrote before is
00:35 - just more reusable
