00:00 - so I did go into a computer science
00:01 - degree no regrets going into that
00:03 - initially I was learning a lot in the
00:05 - program and this is right about when my
00:08 - YouTube channel started to kind of grow
00:09 - so this is first year of University and
00:11 - I'm in computer science I have a YouTube
00:13 - channel with probably about 5 000
00:14 - subscribers at that point in time
00:16 - there's no doubt in my mind you know I'm
00:17 - finishing this degree I'm getting the
00:19 - computer science degree now as I get
00:20 - into second year university the channel
00:22 - is really starting to take off and this
00:24 - is also when I get a job at Microsoft as
00:26 - a software engineering intern so now I'm
00:28 - kind of at the point where I'm starting
00:29 - to achieve a lot of the stuff that I
00:31 - only really have thought would be
00:32 - possible by having a degree I have all
00:35 - these opportunities I start working on
00:36 - algo experts start building out
00:38 - programming excerpt so it comes to the
00:40 - middle of the year right I'm 2.5
00:42 - semesters and and that's kind of when I
00:43 - started hitting my breaking point and
00:44 - start seriously contemplating dropping
00:47 - out of school I'm starting to realize
00:48 - that I just cannot sustainably work the
00:50 - way that I'm working and I can't
00:52 - continue to grow this Channel and this
00:55 - business to the point I want to bring it
00:56 - if I'm going to be in school
