00:00 - so for today's video I wanted to do
00:01 - something different and I wanted to
00:02 - address kind of the younger generation
00:04 - of programmers and talk about some of
00:06 - the obstacles I faced when I was
00:07 - learning programming as a kid and how
00:10 - you can kind of get past that and
00:11 - continue to develop your skills without
00:13 - having a strong background in kind of
00:15 - just computer science and mathematical
00:17 - topics in general now personally I
00:19 - started learning programming when I was
00:21 - 12 years old so I've been doing this for
00:23 - a really long time I have a lot of
00:25 - experience self learning and kind of
00:26 - self teaching and now I'm at the point
00:29 - where I'm teaching programming on this
00:30 - channel so I just have a few tips for
00:32 - you guys I just want to kind of tell you
00:33 - you know some of the obstacles that I
00:35 - know you're gonna run into because I've
00:36 - run into them myself and how you can
00:38 - overcome those and just get better and
00:39 - better and better and how you should be
00:41 - spending your time as you know a young
00:43 - programmer so I just want to make this
00:44 - clear that when I talk about young
00:46 - programmers I'm kind of thinking about
00:48 - people that are under the age of 18 now
00:50 - I know that if you're 23 or 24 you're
00:52 - definitely still young if you're a
00:53 - programmer but what I'm talking about in
00:56 - this video is really gonna relate more
00:57 - to people that are much younger in high
00:59 - school elementary school level trying to
01:01 - get into programming and trying to
01:03 - figure out you know how do we learn this
01:04 - and how do I do this now I know for me
01:06 - when I was younger a massive obstacle
01:08 - was just trying to understand these
01:10 - concepts and I think what really
01:11 - benefited me was taking things slow and
01:14 - this is gonna be kind of my tip number
01:15 - one to you guys
01:16 - don't worry about rushing through
01:18 - different concepts don't worry if you
01:20 - don't understand something on the first
01:21 - time you have to remember that what you
01:23 - were teaching yourself and what you're
01:24 - learning right now is stuff that they
01:26 - don't teach until first or second year
01:27 - university there's stuff that I was
01:29 - doing when I was 13 years old that we
01:31 - are just learning now and I'm my second
01:33 - year of university so remember that
01:35 - these concepts are difficult they're
01:37 - meant to be challenging and you really
01:39 - need to take your time and make sure you
01:40 - understand them before you just blaze
01:42 - through and learn other things and this
01:44 - kind of brings me into my next point
01:45 - which is just keep going slow and really
01:47 - build a strong foundation the important
01:50 - thing to do when you're a kid and you're
01:51 - learning and picking up programming from
01:53 - the beginning is making sure that you
01:54 - don't have gaps in your knowledge and
01:56 - that you build a really strong
01:57 - foundation before you start moving up
01:59 - into some more advanced concepts a lot
02:01 - of people will look at the really basic
02:03 - programming stuff and say this is too
02:05 - easy it's fine I know to do this and
02:07 - just kind of whiz through and go into
02:08 - really advanced concepts and if you're
02:10 - capable of doing that that's great but
02:12 - really make
02:13 - sure that you understand the basics
02:14 - because if you don't get the basics and
02:16 - you try to go to the advance it's just
02:18 - gonna be a massive headache and you'll
02:19 - probably just end up giving up on those
02:21 - concepts that you could have learned if
02:22 - you spent more time mastering the basics
02:25 - so make sure you master the basics take
02:27 - your time and don't worry if it's taking
02:29 - you a long time to learn things if you
02:30 - got to watch a video three four times to
02:32 - get a concept down that's totally fine
02:34 - and that's exactly what I did when I was
02:36 - younger so look at my channel look what
02:38 - I know now and I can tell you when I was
02:39 - twelve you think I was a good programmer
02:41 - no I had no idea what I was doing and
02:43 - like even the most basic stuff was
02:46 - challenging for me and I had to really
02:47 - test myself
02:48 - and learn it as I went on alright so you
02:50 - feel like you've mastered the basics you
02:52 - know you have a little bit of confidence
02:53 - you can solve some basic problems maybe
02:55 - you've made a few basic a little
02:57 - application some hello worlds all of
02:59 - that what now well this is where I'm
03:01 - gonna recommend that you guys really
03:03 - explore the field of programming now I
03:05 - know when I was younger I made a big
03:06 - mistake and I stuck to one kind of route
03:09 - I fought that when I started learning
03:10 - programming what I really wanted to do
03:12 - was web development and I learned HTML I
03:14 - learned CSS I learned JavaScript and I
03:16 - learned PHP and I started just focusing
03:19 - on websites and I started to realize
03:21 - that I really didn't like web
03:23 - development and this is what I've been
03:24 - spending the past year year and a half
03:26 - two years of my time learning how to do
03:27 - creating basic website setting up
03:29 - databases doing some linking and now I'm
03:32 - 14 and I'm sitting here and I'm like I
03:33 - don't like friend and web design I don't
03:35 - like doing this and I really wish that
03:36 - when I was younger I kind of taken a
03:38 - step back and looked at some of the
03:40 - different things you can do with
03:41 - programming and this is my massive
03:43 - recommendation to you if you guys are
03:45 - young and you still have time make sure
03:47 - that you know you kind of think about
03:48 - the different areas of programming and
03:50 - think about what you really want to do I
03:52 - would definitely recommend trying you
03:54 - know Web Design trying a bit of backend
03:56 - trying maybe a little bit more of a
03:57 - difficult language and just kind of
03:59 - dipping your feet in the water in
04:00 - different areas and figuring out what it
04:02 - is you really like cuz you're not gonna
04:04 - know until you try and especially if
04:06 - you're younger chances are you've maybe
04:07 - only been introduced to one programming
04:09 - language or one kind of thing to do in
04:11 - the programming language when the
04:13 - reality is there's so much more so you
04:15 - know spend some time one day just
04:16 - looking at some different things you can
04:18 - do with programming and see if maybe you
04:20 - want to try something for the next week
04:21 - or the next two weeks and see if that's
04:23 - what you really want to do and this is
04:24 - super beneficial because it kind of
04:26 - gives
04:26 - just a domain knowledge and all of these
04:29 - different little areas and then that
04:30 - allows you to kind of jump in and out
04:31 - figure out what the best tool is to do
04:34 - for a specific project what you should
04:35 - be learning and what you really want to
04:37 - be learning because what it comes down
04:38 - to when you're young is you're doing
04:40 - this for fun are you doing this because
04:41 - you really love it and that's why I was
04:43 - doing it when I was younger and that's
04:44 - why I still do it today I genuinely
04:46 - really like programming when I sit in
04:49 - front of the computer and I get dialed
04:50 - in I can create a project and see my
04:52 - work on the computer it's super
04:54 - rewarding feeling to me and that's why
04:55 - you guys should be doing this so make
04:57 - sure that whatever you're doing you're
04:58 - having fun doing it and if you're not
05:00 - enjoying one concept don't give up on
05:02 - programming try something else and kind
05:04 - of dip your feet around and figure out
05:05 - what it is you really want to do now
05:07 - another obstacle that I know a lot of
05:09 - you guys run into is when you're trying
05:11 - to do things with algorithms now
05:13 - algorithm seems like a really fancy word
05:15 - and a lot of people don't know what it
05:16 - means essentially it's just a set of
05:17 - instructions but you're gonna get to a
05:19 - point where you kind of get to an
05:20 - intermediate or advanced level of
05:22 - programming and whatever programming
05:24 - language it is that you're using and you
05:26 - start to talk about some more
05:27 - mathematical concepts so you start to
05:29 - start seeing things that have equations
05:31 - and have math and have symbols that
05:33 - maybe you've never seen before I just
05:35 - wanted to kind of make a disclaimer I
05:36 - just let you guys know that there's two
05:38 - main kind of sides of programming and of
05:41 - computer science there's one side that's
05:43 - more of this software engineering side
05:45 - and there's one side that's more of the
05:46 - computer science field a lot of people
05:48 - don't know this and I didn't really
05:49 - notice that much until I got to
05:51 - university and now I'm majoring in
05:52 - computer science but the computer
05:54 - science side of things is way more
05:56 - problem-solving logical thinking
05:58 - algorithm analysis mathematics whereas
06:02 - software engineering is probably what
06:03 - most of you guys are doing which is
06:05 - creating projects building a website
06:07 - talking about the design patterns the
06:10 - way of doing things and way more of you
06:13 - know kind of the practical applying
06:15 - things and creating projects then the
06:17 - theory based stuff which is computer
06:19 - science so I just want to make you guys
06:20 - aware of these two kind of fields and I
06:22 - wanted to recommend that you kind of get
06:24 - a taste of both of them because you
06:25 - might actually end up liking one better
06:27 - than the other I know for myself I'm
06:29 - kind of a mix between the two because
06:31 - I'm pretty good at math and I actually
06:32 - like doing algorithm analysis and design
06:35 - but I also really like applying stuff
06:36 - into projects and bringing those
06:38 - algorithms to life whereas a lot of you
06:40 - guys
06:40 - may not be the best at math and I just I
06:42 - don't want you to get scared when you
06:44 - see this side of computer science which
06:45 - inevitably you'll run into which is
06:47 - really just math and problem solving and
06:49 - advanced concepts with equations you
06:51 - don't necessarily need to learn all of
06:53 - that to be a good programmer and that's
06:55 - what I just wanted to make clear is that
06:56 - there's these two kind of sides and you
06:59 - should explore both of them and kind of
07:00 - see what it one you like best but don't
07:03 - be scared if you're not the best at both
07:05 - sides if you're really good at software
07:07 - development and creating projects and
07:08 - programming stick with that that's more
07:10 - than fine and when you get to a point
07:11 - you need to know this you'll be taught
07:13 - it and you'll be able to figure it out
07:14 - but if you like problem-solving and you
07:16 - like math and you like analysis then you
07:18 - should look more into some computer
07:19 - science II topics where you're kind of
07:20 - learning about algorithms and data
07:22 - structures and design because that'll
07:23 - help you a lot when you get to your
07:25 - university courses in computer science
07:27 - if that's where you're choosing to take
07:28 - so I just wanted to say to wrap up this
07:30 - video that if you guys are a young
07:32 - programmer usually you know under 18 and
07:34 - you really do enjoy programming and you
07:36 - like learning it and you like teaching
07:37 - yourself at on the side or doing it in
07:39 - your spare time you're so far ahead of
07:41 - everyone else that's trying to get into
07:43 - the programming game I can tell you from
07:45 - experience I'm a university student most
07:48 - people that take computer science are
07:49 - going to software engineering have never
07:51 - programmed before in their life or if
07:53 - they have they've only done very basic
07:54 - things if you plan on going into
07:56 - software engineering or computer science
07:58 - or some kind of tack related field and
08:00 - you've been learning programming already
08:02 - you're going to be miles ahead and
08:04 - regardless of how much you know if you
08:05 - have any background you're already ahead
08:08 - my first year programming class is
08:10 - genuinely something I could have taught
08:12 - it was that simple it was that basic and
08:14 - there was nothing in that class that I
08:16 - didn't already know so thank you guys
08:18 - for watching I hope you enjoyed this
08:20 - video I'd love to hear how old are you
08:22 - guys let me know when you started
08:23 - learning programming some of the
08:25 - obstacles that you've ran into and we'll
08:26 - have a chat in the comments down below
08:28 - but with that being said I will see you
08:30 - guys in another
