00:01 - thank you
00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - in this video I'll share with you
00:10 - exactly what I would do if I was a
00:12 - complete beginner starting completely
00:13 - from scratch and wanted to make a
00:15 - hundred thousand dollars from
00:17 - development or programming
00:22 - now there's a lot of different ways to
00:24 - go about doing this however I think what
00:26 - I'm going to lay out here is probably
00:27 - the fastest route to go to making that
00:29 - kind of money but I do want to mention
00:31 - that this is going to skip over some of
00:33 - the fundamental skills that I may have
00:35 - mentioned in some of my other videos
00:36 - talking about how do you master python
00:38 - or the road to becoming a self-taught
00:40 - developer all those other kind of videos
00:42 - those are really focused on how do you
00:44 - build all of these skills that are going
00:45 - to be important in a long-term career a
00:48 - skill that you need to land a full-time
00:49 - position that could be paying you way
00:51 - more than a hundred thousand dollars a
00:52 - year this video is really focused on
00:54 - okay my main goal is how do I make this
00:57 - money as quickly as possible and that's
00:58 - going to mean skipping out on a bunch of
01:00 - the skills that you don't need to get
01:02 - immediately into some jobs that can pay
01:04 - you a good amount of money so hopefully
01:05 - that makes a little bit of sense to you
01:06 - but let me dive into this kind of road
01:08 - map or guide and share with you exactly
01:11 - what I would do
01:15 - so the first thing I would do before I
01:18 - touch any programming languages get into
01:20 - any code is I would figure out what
01:22 - Niche I wanted to get into now the niche
01:24 - that I would pick would be the thing
01:26 - that had the lowest barrier to entry so
01:28 - essentially required the least amount of
01:29 - time but gave me the highest value skill
01:32 - relative to the time put in now there's
01:34 - a lot of niches like back-end developer
01:36 - full stack developer where you can make
01:38 - a ton of money if you master that talk
01:40 - however that's probably going to take
01:41 - you months if not years to really get to
01:44 - a point where you're job ready so you
01:46 - probably want to be picking something
01:47 - that's a little bit less intimidating
01:49 - kind of less uh work right just less
01:51 - skill required so you can actually go
01:53 - out there and start making money as fast
01:55 - as possible so I'll list out a bunch of
01:57 - niches here and then I'll give you an
01:58 - example of one that's probably the best
02:00 - for beginners just in terms of how much
02:02 - money you can make doing it and how easy
02:04 - it is to really dive into so we have
02:06 - stuff like basic web design we have
02:09 - e-commerce we have Shopify we have
02:11 - mobile development data science machine
02:14 - learning in infrastructure devops cyber
02:17 - security game development I could go on
02:19 - and list like a bunch of different
02:21 - niches here right in the programming
02:22 - field now any one of these niches are
02:24 - going to be a good one to get into but
02:26 - you want to be picking the highest value
02:27 - you want right which one could I start
02:29 - charging money for immediately now if
02:31 - you check out the sponsor of this video
02:32 - which is free mode you'll see that they
02:34 - actually have an entire boot camp on
02:36 - Shopify and e-commerce development now
02:38 - this is probably the best Niche to dive
02:40 - into because this requires essentially
02:42 - basic front-end developer skills like
02:44 - CSS HTML JavaScript but you don't have
02:46 - to be an absolute expert to use these
02:48 - platforms right or to make a Shopify
02:50 - store this is kind of a low code
02:52 - platform this is something that almost
02:54 - any of you watching this video could
02:55 - probably do in the next two or three
02:57 - weeks with very minimal coding no and
03:00 - this is a very high value skill because
03:01 - a lot of people right now have
03:03 - e-commerce stores need maintenance done
03:04 - on them they need you to build a store
03:06 - for them they need you to go and add a
03:08 - custom page or some cool animation or
03:10 - JavaScript you know code on the website
03:12 - and this is something you can get paid a
03:14 - significant amount of money to do you
03:15 - with very limited skill set you actually
03:18 - think of what's required to go out there
03:20 - and build a website in 2022 it's very
03:23 - basic knowledge of programming and
03:25 - knowing how to use one of these kind of
03:26 - editors right Shopify Wix WordPress
03:29 - whatever it made so I would personally
03:31 - probably go into something like
03:33 - front-end development learn just the
03:35 - absolute Basics pick up some kind of
03:37 - platform right like Shopify Wix
03:39 - WordPress Squarespace and then
03:41 - immediately go out there into the free
03:43 - market and start charging money for it
03:44 - now if you check out fremo from the link
03:46 - in the description you'll see that this
03:47 - is exactly what their course kind of
03:49 - aims to do right that's what it tries to
03:51 - teach you how do you go from zero
03:52 - knowledge of programming to getting paid
03:54 - as quickly as possible and that's why I
03:56 - actually put them on this video as a
03:58 - sponsor because it's just the most
03:59 - fitting thing I could think of right
04:00 - this is a real world example of okay
04:02 - you're a complete beginner learn the
04:04 - basics that you need immediately start
04:06 - making money from it get into some real
04:07 - world projects have some mentors have
04:10 - some Live support and that will push you
04:12 - very very quickly into a position where
04:14 - you can charge money for these skills
04:16 - that you've obtained so hopefully that
04:17 - makes a bit of sense but first step here
04:19 - is really pick your Niche figure out
04:21 - what it is that I want to learn and
04:22 - what's going to make me the most amount
04:24 - of money as quickly as possible then
04:26 - move on to the next steps
04:31 - so after you've picked your Niche and
04:33 - you have some kind of vision or some
04:35 - kind of direction that you're going to
04:36 - be going in now you have to actually
04:37 - acquire this skill now this is going to
04:39 - be different and take a different amount
04:40 - of time depending on what Niche you want
04:42 - to go into and what you're focused on
04:44 - but for me personally I would probably
04:46 - look for some kind of course or some
04:48 - kind of comprehensive resource whether
04:50 - it's free or whether it's paid they gave
04:52 - me everything I needed in one place
04:54 - ideally I'm trying to do this as quickly
04:56 - as I can so I don't want to be spending
04:58 - hours searching every day for free
05:00 - resources or just looking for all
05:02 - different kinds of stuff I kind of want
05:04 - everything in one place and I want
05:06 - someone who's qualified to be kind of
05:08 - guiding me into what I need to learn one
05:11 - of the hardest parts when you're just
05:12 - getting started is figuring out what you
05:14 - need to learn then you actually have to
05:16 - go and learn it so for me I would try to
05:18 - skip the figuring out what I need to
05:19 - learn part and just pay someone to tell
05:21 - me that whether it's through a call or a
05:23 - mentorship or I'm paying for a course
05:25 - I'm going in a mini Boot Camp or
05:26 - whatever it may be but if I was doing
05:28 - this as fast as I could then I would
05:30 - just pay to try to do that now if I
05:31 - didn't have the money to pay for that
05:33 - then I would obviously have to build a
05:35 - curriculum on my own go and consult a
05:37 - lot of kind of free resources and then
05:39 - go and learn all these topics from
05:41 - whatever free place I could find now
05:42 - that's 100 doable that would just
05:44 - definitely take me longer and I'd spend
05:46 - you know a good amount of time kind of
05:48 - searching for these resources as opposed
05:50 - to having them in a single place so
05:52 - that's what you got to do in this
05:52 - section I wish I could give you more
05:54 - actionable advice but you have to find a
05:56 - place you can learn what it is you need
05:58 - to learn and then go and learn it
06:03 - all right now step three and this can
06:05 - kind of be intertwined with step two is
06:08 - going to be to find some kind of support
06:09 - group or Mentor or network where you can
06:12 - validate that you actually know what
06:14 - you're doing so once you've learned some
06:16 - of the basics so once you're getting
06:17 - into the point where you're acquiring
06:18 - this skill to be able to build the
06:21 - confidence to sell your services you
06:23 - need to know that you actually have some
06:24 - idea what you're doing right you need
06:26 - someone to tell you that knows what
06:27 - they're doing hey yes this is correct
06:29 - yes you're doing this right yes you're
06:31 - not an idiot right yes you're not
06:32 - wasting your time you just need some
06:34 - validation to build that kind of
06:36 - internal confidence so that you can then
06:37 - feel like oh I can go apply for jobs now
06:40 - I can go and actually make some money I
06:42 - can go and charge people on Fiverr or
06:44 - upwork or whatever it's gonna be I know
06:46 - this step is what holds a lot of people
06:47 - back they've learned all this stuff
06:49 - usually on their own and now they're
06:51 - like well you know I think I'm there but
06:53 - I don't know if I'm there and they have
06:54 - this kind of lack of confidence right
06:56 - they have the Imposter syndrome where
06:57 - they don't push themselves to The Next
06:59 - Step because they think there's so much
07:01 - more stuff they still need to learn so
07:03 - personally for me I would look for
07:05 - either kind of like a free community or
07:07 - I would look for a paid Mentor or
07:08 - someone or something where I could
07:10 - validate what I know and I could go and
07:12 - check off the box and say yes I know how
07:14 - to do this yes I know how to do this oh
07:16 - I missed that one okay I gotta go back
07:17 - and learn that topic and then once I
07:19 - felt confident I was like okay I know
07:21 - what I'm doing other people are kind of
07:22 - at my level they're making money doing
07:24 - the same thing I am I'm gonna go now and
07:26 - jump in and kind of start the money
07:27 - making process right
07:33 - so now that you've done that you've
07:34 - picked your Niche you've learned the
07:36 - skills you've got some kind of
07:37 - validation some mentors maybe like a
07:39 - little group or some community that
07:40 - you're a part of where you can kind of
07:42 - ask questions and validate what you know
07:44 - now it's time to make money right okay
07:45 - gotta go out there and actually earn
07:47 - some dollars so for me what I would do
07:49 - is just immediately start applying to
07:50 - any kind of freelance or contractor jobs
07:52 - that I could find and I would do as many
07:55 - as possible because as a freelance
07:57 - developer I can take on a hundred jobs
07:58 - right I can work 14 hours a day I can do
08:01 - as much as I want to do and I can work
08:03 - on any kind of schedule whereas if I try
08:05 - to go for a full-time job that's
08:07 - probably going to take me a lot longer
08:08 - to acquire there's probably going to be
08:10 - some higher requirements especially if
08:11 - the company is offering benefits if
08:13 - there's in-person interviews if they
08:15 - have this whole long process that's
08:17 - going to be a slower Avenue to me making
08:19 - money as quickly as possible so you have
08:20 - you know the two routes you can go and
08:22 - kind of do it freelance on your own
08:23 - which is what I would feel comfortable
08:24 - doing or you can go and try to jump into
08:27 - some kind of jump now I know for a lot
08:29 - of people getting just a full-time gig
08:31 - is a little bit more comforting right
08:32 - that's kind of what they're used to
08:33 - that's what they've done before but for
08:35 - me personally I've always kind of made
08:36 - money on my own so that's what I would
08:38 - probably kind of lean towards okay how
08:41 - can I maximize my income and not be
08:43 - limited by a single number that I
08:44 - negotiate one time when I go in for a
08:47 - job interview so I would post my stuff
08:49 - on Fiverr on upwork I would go and find
08:51 - any kind of contract stuff that I could
08:53 - so anyone looking for work and I would
08:54 - spend a significant amount of time just
08:56 - constantly reaching out to people and
08:58 - saying can I do this for you can I do
09:00 - this for you how can I help you blah
09:01 - blah I'm trying to get as much work as
09:03 - possible so how would I do that well I
09:05 - might go on LinkedIn and find people
09:06 - that are looking for specific developers
09:08 - I might go to people I know that have
09:10 - say a Shopify store or need a game
09:12 - developed or whatever Niche I'm in and
09:14 - again offer my services and just keep
09:16 - going and going and going and getting as
09:17 - many clients as humanly possible now
09:19 - there's so many different ways to go
09:20 - about doing that this isn't kind of like
09:22 - a marketing or sales video I won't claim
09:24 - to be an expert in that field but that's
09:26 - what I would do I'd go out and try to
09:27 - get as many freelance gigs as possible
09:29 - now at the same time once I started
09:31 - taking on a few gigs and I felt it
09:33 - confident I might even start trying to
09:35 - teach people what I know maybe someone's
09:36 - a complete beginner and maybe I can
09:38 - mentor them a little bit maybe I can
09:40 - give them a basic tutoring session on
09:41 - how to use Shopify I can explain
09:43 - something to them I would take on side
09:45 - gigs as well and just really do anything
09:48 - that I thought could make me money right
09:49 - so I might even start a blog I might
09:51 - start a podcast I might make some
09:52 - YouTube videos that's definitely a
09:54 - longer term play but you guys could see
09:56 - where I'm at now and that's what I
09:57 - started doing well before I was like a
10:00 - good programmer I was a beginner
10:01 - programmer yet I was still teaching
10:03 - people that were even more beginner than
10:05 - me how to get to you know one step
10:07 - further in their Journey so that's
10:09 - personally what I would kind of do I
10:10 - would take on major contract work where
10:12 - I try to get some big contracts a bit of
10:14 - security in terms of the income then I
10:16 - would in my free time if I didn't have
10:18 - any work to do be building out some kind
10:20 - of side business or side gig okay I'm
10:22 - gonna do a blog post okay I'm gonna do a
10:24 - YouTube video okay I'm gonna do a
10:26 - podcast whatever something where there's
10:27 - the potential to grow a little bit of an
10:29 - audience and then hopefully from that
10:31 - audience I can get some clients or I can
10:34 - start to monetize the Audience by doing
10:36 - sponsorships advertising whatever again
10:39 - much longer term play but even if you
10:41 - add a hundred people that read your blog
10:43 - the chance that one of them is looking
10:44 - for the service you're offering is
10:46 - fairly High you could probably get you
10:47 - know a few clients from doing it so that
10:49 - said I think I'll wrap up the video here
10:51 - hopefully you guys were able to get a
10:52 - little bit of value from this obviously
10:54 - this is not easy to do I'm never going
10:56 - to tell you it's easy to go out there
10:57 - and make a ton of money from programming
10:58 - but is 100 possible hundreds of
11:01 - thousands if not millions of people do
11:02 - it every single year and you really just
11:04 - gotta push yourself and kind of find the
11:06 - motivation to go out there and start
11:08 - because I promise you if you do you will
11:10 - not regret it that said I hope you
11:11 - enjoyed if you did make sure to leave a
11:12 - like subscribe the channel I will see
11:14 - you in the next one
11:18 - foreign
