00:02 - [Music]
00:07 - hello everybody and welcome back to the
00:09 - youtube video
00:10 - so in today's video what i'm going to be
00:11 - doing is walking you through a
00:13 - timeline of everything that i've learned
00:15 - coding since i started when i was 12
00:17 - years old
00:18 - so i'm 20 years old right now i started
00:20 - about eight years ago
00:21 - and i really just started learning using
00:23 - youtube videos my journey has been a
00:25 - crazy squiggly line of me trying to
00:27 - figure out what i liked
00:28 - what i actually wanted to do when i was
00:30 - programming and then kind of just
00:31 - experimenting with a bunch of different
00:33 - languages and frameworks
00:34 - because i wanted to and i found those
00:36 - enjoyable so you're going to see this
00:38 - journey is
00:38 - all over the place it goes in every
00:40 - which direction and there is really no
00:42 - focus until i kind of get into the time
00:44 - that i'm 18 or 19 years old so with that
00:46 - being said
00:46 - let's start getting into the journey but
00:48 - i just want to state that almost
00:50 - everything that i've learned and that
00:51 - i'm going to be bringing up here i
00:52 - learned through youtube videos
00:54 - now unfortunately back when i was
00:56 - learning through youtube videos there
00:57 - was really no way for me to track
00:59 - exactly what i was watching kind of the
01:00 - videos i had been through
01:02 - and all the stuff that i had done well
01:03 - fortunately the sponsor of this video
01:05 - has a solution for that
01:06 - proteus is a free chrome extension that
01:08 - tracks your time learning on youtube
01:10 - it makes it simple to find high quality
01:12 - learning resources and provides an
01:14 - awesome way to track all of your
01:15 - learning progress
01:16 - as you acquire hours watching videos you
01:18 - can earn a digital certificate in
01:20 - specific subject areas
01:21 - and these certificates can then be added
01:23 - to your linkedin profile
01:25 - proteus makes it simple to keep track of
01:27 - your progress and stay on top of your
01:28 - learning goals
01:29 - similar to spotify playlists users can
01:31 - package together different videos and
01:33 - design a curriculum for other users to
01:35 - follow along with
01:36 - so if you want to start tracking your
01:37 - learning and earning digital
01:38 - certificates
01:39 - download proteus the free chrome
01:41 - extension from the link in the
01:42 - description
01:43 - so before i go into this timeline of
01:45 - everything i've learned coding i
01:47 - actually want to bring us back to even
01:48 - further when i was probably in grade 4 5
01:51 - 6 back in my childhood and talk about
01:53 - kind of the inspiration and motivation
01:55 - to move into this tech world
01:57 - i was very fortunate that at a pretty
01:59 - young age i had a really good idea of
02:00 - what i wanted to do
02:01 - and i just had a lot of interest that
02:03 - really aligned well with the career in
02:05 - tech
02:05 - and while i know back when i was in
02:07 - elementary school i was always a kid who
02:09 - never really struggled was you know a
02:10 - straight a student
02:12 - it was really easy for me i never needed
02:13 - to study i'm sure many of you were that
02:15 - people are new people like that
02:17 - and well that led me to have a lot of
02:19 - free time to kind of you know work on
02:20 - hobbies just be interested in different
02:22 - things played a lot of sports
02:24 - and i remember that one of my main
02:25 - hobbies was just trying to figure
02:27 - things out i was always someone who was
02:28 - just really interested in how things
02:30 - worked why
02:31 - things worked and as soon as i got my
02:33 - first ipod at my first computer
02:35 - these devices i was holding my hand were
02:37 - just so fascinating to me i wanted to
02:38 - know how they worked i wanted to know
02:40 - why i could just immediately get
02:42 - any information i wanted from this
02:44 - search engine on the computer
02:45 - or how when i pressed that button it
02:47 - actually turned on the different
02:48 - components how they were operating
02:50 - inside
02:50 - and that just led me to do a lot of
02:52 - research into computers into technology
02:54 - and just
02:55 - teaching myself a lot of different
02:56 - things not you know for hours every day
02:58 - but in a lot of my spare time as a kid
03:01 - and eventually that kind of passion and
03:03 - interest led me into figuring out this
03:05 - thing called coding
03:06 - so i found coding in 2012 probably about
03:09 - grade 8 at this point
03:10 - and again i really not had any exposure
03:13 - this i didn't have any people telling me
03:14 - to learn coding i didn't have any real
03:16 - role models in my life
03:18 - or mentors or anything like that this
03:19 - was just a very self-interest thing it
03:21 - was just what i
03:22 - you know inevitably came upon during all
03:24 - this research and all this stuff that i
03:26 - was looking into
03:27 - and the first thing that i found was you
03:29 - know how to code for beginners or
03:31 - whatever introduction to html
03:33 - now of course many of you won't consider
03:35 - that coding but i'm just going to
03:36 - generalize and say yes that is my
03:38 - introduction to coding is html
03:40 - and i found this channel called the new
03:42 - boston which is still an amazing channel
03:44 - today i'd highly recommend you guys look
03:46 - at that channel but i believe this
03:47 - hasn't been active for like probably
03:49 - three
03:49 - four years or something like that
03:51 - anyways the guy named bucky who ran this
03:53 - channel
03:53 - i had an introduction to programming
03:55 - series with html
03:56 - so i started using html and just went
03:59 - through all of these videos and i would
04:00 - do like one or two videos a night
04:02 - and just kind of go through slowly and
04:04 - learn all these different topics
04:06 - now i want to be really clear when i was
04:07 - doing this this was
04:09 - really hard back in you know grade 8
04:11 - like i'm not even very good at typing
04:13 - i'm on like a really crappy laptop i've
04:15 - got my phone with the video i'm like
04:16 - typing it out with the video
04:18 - and i was trying really hard to make
04:20 - sure that i actually understood
04:22 - everything that was happening and i
04:23 - would watch the video you know three
04:24 - four times if i had to
04:26 - i would struggle through topics and you
04:27 - know there's some videos that might take
04:29 - me days to get through just because
04:30 - i really couldn't grasp the concept and
04:32 - i had to keep watching and going through
04:34 - and making sure i really understood so
04:36 - it was something that i really struggled
04:38 - with when i started coding at such a
04:40 - young age
04:40 - and i just want to make that really
04:41 - clear because a lot of people kind of
04:43 - look at me and what i've done and think
04:44 - that i'm just you know this genius
04:46 - prodigy whatever
04:47 - i can guarantee you i'm not i genuinely
04:49 - am someone who you know maybe might be
04:51 - smarter than the average guy
04:52 - but they worked really hard to actually
04:54 - get a good programming base
04:56 - at a really young age so regardless
04:58 - started learning html eventually started
05:00 - getting good at it
05:01 - and really just started falling in love
05:02 - with this process of kind of learning
05:04 - working hard and programming because
05:06 - this was the first thing in my life that
05:08 - had actually challenged me and that i
05:09 - saw
05:10 - some significant progress in as i put
05:12 - more work in so that led me into dealing
05:14 - with you know kind of robotic stuff and
05:15 - just getting more into all this kind of
05:17 - tech sphere at a young age
05:19 - and then eventually after i started
05:20 - getting good enough at html that i could
05:22 - make some
05:23 - decent web pages and stuff like that i
05:25 - learned css obviously to style the web
05:27 - pages and then
05:28 - javascript so now let's call it a year
05:30 - after 2013
05:32 - i start learning javascript and
05:34 - javascript really is what
05:35 - got me in and just kind of pulled me
05:37 - into this text sphere and
05:38 - convinced me that this is what i wanted
05:40 - to do and that's because this was the
05:42 - first thing i found that
05:43 - was kind of the more back end thing was
05:45 - behind the scenes it would deal with the
05:47 - logic of the web page and handling
05:49 - errors and messages and stuff like that
05:51 - and that really hooked me because i'm
05:52 - not someone who's into design or ui
05:55 - or really front-end web development at
05:56 - all in the javascript i was like wow
05:59 - i much prefer doing this than actually
06:02 - creating the web page itself
06:04 - so long story short learn javascript
06:06 - really fall in love with javascript
06:08 - and making websites now that are kind of
06:10 - interactive i remember the first
06:12 - big app i made and big relative
06:15 - obviously to the time
06:16 - was a password generator so it literally
06:18 - was like you press a button you choose a
06:20 - few parameters or filters
06:21 - and it generates you some random
06:23 - password and you can like view it and
06:24 - stop viewing it and all that kind of
06:26 - stuff
06:26 - but i just remember being like so amazed
06:29 - at the fact that i was able to make that
06:30 - and just type on the computer and see
06:32 - that output popping up so anyways you
06:33 - know time goes on i'm now
06:36 - dsnatjavascript.html i can make some
06:37 - basic web pages
06:38 - and now let's say we're like mid-2013
06:41 - and i actually want to make a website
06:43 - i'm in grade 8 and i'm like hey you know
06:44 - like my school's website is really crap
06:46 - i think it'd be really cool if i remade
06:48 - that website and gave them one that was
06:50 - better
06:51 - so i didn't actually end up following
06:53 - through with that but that led me to
06:54 - learning php
06:55 - you got to remember this is back in 2013
06:57 - when php was very alive it was used a
06:59 - lot a lot of people were using it
07:01 - and so i learned php and started trying
07:03 - to deal with all this database stuff and
07:05 - figuring out oh how can i send stuff
07:06 - from this front end web development
07:08 - to this php backend how can i do all
07:10 - that kind of stuff
07:11 - so php did not last long in my journey
07:14 - it was really hard for me i really
07:16 - struggled with php and i just never
07:18 - really got super interested in it it
07:20 - wasn't something that
07:21 - i really liked doing and that slowly led
07:23 - me to realize that i wasn't interested
07:25 - in actually you know making
07:26 - kind of customer facing products i
07:28 - didn't like making and designing user
07:30 - interfaces and stuff like that
07:32 - i was really interested in the back end
07:34 - the problem solving the logic
07:36 - and that eventually led me in 2014 to
07:38 - start learning c
07:39 - sharp so i started learning c sharp
07:41 - which is a really tough language for me
07:42 - this is something that's pretty hard
07:44 - just a lot of concepts i'm just not
07:46 - capable of grasping it really just
07:48 - was a difficult thing and i never really
07:49 - found any great instructors online or
07:51 - people that i really clicked with to get
07:53 - good at the language
07:54 - i got good enough to the point where i
07:55 - could make some really basic 2d
07:57 - applications i remember
07:58 - one of the ones i made that i was really
08:00 - proud of with was this 2d
08:02 - um point plotting thing so back in grade
08:04 - 9 math what we had to do is you know
08:06 - give us two points and then say
08:07 - calculate the slope calculate the
08:09 - y-intercept whatever it was in graphing
08:11 - so i made this program that essentially
08:13 - could plot a bunch of different points
08:15 - and then it could draw a line through
08:16 - them and it could tell you the distance
08:17 - between the points the rise over run the
08:19 - slope
08:20 - so that i didn't have to do all that for
08:21 - my homework so that was something i was
08:23 - really proud of i
08:24 - hope i still have that program but
08:25 - anyways i wrote that in c sharp
08:27 - and then i remember in grade nine it's
08:29 - now nearing the end of grade nine
08:31 - and i had heard that there's this
08:32 - programming competition that had
08:33 - happened
08:34 - and i really wanted to write that this
08:36 - is something that you know this is my
08:37 - hobby
08:37 - passion interest whatever and i had
08:39 - missed this first year programming
08:41 - competition so i went to the
08:42 - uh head of the club or whoever was
08:44 - running this and i said hey you know how
08:46 - can i write this competition how can
08:48 - i get in on this next year and he said
08:50 - hey um you know what languages you know
08:52 - blah blah i said hey i'm in c
08:53 - sharp right now that's kind of my main
08:54 - thing and he said oh that's kind of
08:56 - unfortunate and you can't write in c
08:58 - sharp for this competition
09:00 - so you're going to have to learn another
09:01 - language or just not write it and i said
09:03 - well what's probably the easiest one to
09:04 - do and he said well you could learn
09:06 - python you already
09:07 - know c sharp we're gonna be using python
09:09 - in grade 11 and 12 if you're taking my
09:10 - programming courses
09:12 - and i was like yeah i'm going to be
09:13 - doing that so i just started learning
09:14 - python
09:15 - so i started learning python and i kid
09:16 - you not the day that i started using
09:18 - python i
09:19 - just immediately fell in love with the
09:20 - language and that was just because it
09:22 - was so much easier in almost every way
09:25 - than c sharp
09:26 - i could just whip stuff up really
09:27 - quickly i could make some really basic
09:29 - scripts i didn't need to go through all
09:30 - the kind of tedious things that you
09:32 - would have to do in c
09:33 - sharp and i kind of figured out that hey
09:35 - you know i like c sharp
09:36 - i'll write it a little bit but python is
09:38 - where i want to go and that's kind of
09:39 - what i want to learn next
09:41 - so i started getting really good at
09:42 - python and you know up until grade 10
09:44 - and then eventually i wrote this
09:46 - canadian computing competition which was
09:48 - hosted by the university of waterloo
09:50 - first year i did it i did okay probably
09:53 - middle of the pack nothing to write home
09:54 - about
09:55 - uh and it was way harder than i was
09:56 - expecting it to be and i kind of
09:58 - realized i'm like oh these are like
09:59 - really difficult problems
10:01 - and this isn't just programming there's
10:03 - actually a ton of math and problem
10:04 - solving that goes into this
10:06 - so i said hey you know next year i want
10:07 - to come back and write this again and
10:09 - hopefully i can do better so i actually
10:10 - did some more real preparation did some
10:12 - programming problems and stuff like that
10:14 - and then in grade 11 i wrote this
10:16 - competition did quite well and i think
10:18 - it was actually the top in my school
10:20 - at least for the age range that i was in
10:22 - at that time so that gave me a lot of
10:24 - motivation i was like
10:25 - hey you know like i'm actually pretty
10:26 - good at this this is something i could
10:28 - do for a living this might kind of be
10:29 - the direction i want to go in
10:31 - and that's kind of when i made the
10:32 - decision in grade 11 and 12 so that
10:34 - would be for me i guess
10:36 - 2016 2017 that this is what i want to do
10:39 - and this is kind of you know
10:40 - what i'm aiming for in my life
10:41 - essentially so obviously really early
10:44 - fortunate to know that at my age but
10:46 - that's pretty much what happened
10:47 - so grade 11 12 go by i take the
10:50 - computing classes that we have at our
10:52 - high school which are just teaching
10:53 - stuff in python and introducing us to
10:55 - pygame
10:56 - which is a 2d module to make like little
10:58 - graphical games and stuff
11:00 - started using pie game really fell in
11:01 - love with pie game because i could make
11:03 - a ton of different cool apps i can make
11:04 - games that's how i made my big golf game
11:07 - that some of you may have seen
11:08 - as my first programming project or
11:10 - whatever that i put on my channel
11:12 - probably a month or two ago something
11:14 - like that but regardless
11:16 - get through uh get through high school
11:18 - in grade 12. now i'm pretty good at
11:20 - programming i've been programming in
11:21 - python for about three years
11:23 - i know some c sharp javascript php html
11:26 - and i get to university so i enroll in
11:28 - computer science i go to the university
11:30 - of ottawa as many of you know
11:32 - and then i take my introduction to
11:34 - computing one course
11:35 - so in the meantime while this was
11:37 - happening i believe actually at the end
11:38 - of grade 11 i had started my youtube
11:40 - channel which has just given me even
11:42 - more time to really focus on programming
11:44 - and teach programming online so that
11:46 - youtube channel started
11:47 - almost three and a half years ago three
11:49 - years ago something like that
11:51 - anyways again to first year university
11:53 - i'm taking my introduction to computing
11:55 - courses and all my mandatory first year
11:56 - courses
11:57 - they're just really easy for me i'm not
11:59 - really struggling and i have a ton of
12:00 - time to work on my youtube channel and
12:02 - learn a lot more programming
12:04 - so i really dial in on python i started
12:06 - learning a ton of machine learning and
12:07 - ai so i'm dealing with tensorflow
12:09 - keras pi torch you know all those
12:11 - popular modules then i start working
12:13 - with things like kivy and pyqt5
12:15 - and just really getting a good kind of
12:17 - foundation in python and a good
12:19 - um i don't even know a variety of
12:22 - different modules and things that i can
12:23 - do with it
12:24 - now here comes second semester first
12:26 - year so this is in 2018
12:28 - and now we have introduction to
12:30 - computing 2 which is taught in java
12:32 - so now new language coming up on the
12:34 - board here in 2018
12:36 - java something i've never used before
12:38 - similar enough
12:39 - to languages that i knew like c sharp
12:41 - but
12:42 - again a new thing so i start learning
12:43 - java get quite good at java spend pretty
12:45 - much my whole christmas break just
12:47 - prepping for that course and making sure
12:49 - that
12:49 - i really know java well before i hop in
12:51 - there do really well in that java course
12:53 - and then
12:54 - the whole summer after that i worked as
12:56 - a stem program coordinator at a summer
12:58 - camp
12:58 - where i pretty much just use python the
13:00 - entire time and then
13:02 - i come back to second year university
13:04 - now we're in 2019
13:06 - and the first semester of second year i
13:08 - am in a
13:09 - i believe it is a software engineering
13:11 - course and we're actually making an
13:12 - android app as our final project in that
13:14 - course
13:15 - so that leads me to learn about android
13:17 - development to start getting in and
13:19 - learning about kotlin and java and all
13:20 - that and stuff you can do with making
13:22 - apps
13:23 - that was really cool then i had my
13:25 - introduction to
13:26 - databases or databases wherever you say
13:28 - that so i've learned sql
13:30 - and then i got into another programming
13:32 - course i don't
13:33 - know the name of this i think it was
13:34 - programming paradigms or something like
13:36 - that
13:37 - and in that course we actually learned
13:38 - three different programming languages
13:40 - so we learned golang we learned scheme
13:42 - and we learned prologue
13:44 - i know many of you probably don't know
13:46 - schemer prologue or if you do you are
13:47 - probably older than i am
13:49 - regardless we learned those languages i
13:51 - really fell in love with golang when i
13:53 - started learning that because it was
13:54 - super fast it had concurrency control
13:56 - it was pretty similar to python it was a
13:58 - typed language
13:59 - blah blah blah blah all that stuff so i
14:01 - get into golang start teaching that on
14:03 - the youtube channel
14:04 - and then now after all of that we're in
14:07 - the summer
14:08 - of second year so pretty much right now
14:10 - and the only
14:11 - new language that i'm learning is dart
14:13 - so the reason i'm learning dart is
14:15 - because i'm making a flutter application
14:16 - right now and i'm teaching that on the
14:18 - youtube channel
14:19 - as you guys probably have seen so that
14:21 - uses a language called dart which i
14:22 - believe is designed and developed by
14:24 - google
14:25 - and now we need to talk about my
14:27 - microsoft internship
14:28 - where i learned typescript and react so
14:31 - now we're at the point right where
14:32 - it's this year it's 2020 and i have this
14:35 - internship at microsoft that i'm doing
14:37 - so i get that job i accidentally skipped
14:39 - over some stuff here with the dart and
14:40 - flutter stuff
14:41 - ignore that but let's move back a few
14:43 - months so you know beginning of 2020
14:45 - i get this internship at microsoft i'm
14:47 - working on the python ai tools team
14:50 - so i'm doing the python extension for
14:52 - visual studio code
14:53 - within that extension i'm working on
14:55 - data science related features and while
14:57 - pretty much
14:57 - all of those features in the extension
14:59 - for vs code are written in typescript
15:01 - so i've never used typescript before but
15:03 - i know javascript so it's kind of a good
15:05 - introduction to typescript
15:06 - i hop into microsoft start working in
15:08 - that code base really get familiar with
15:10 - typescript and react which are kind of
15:12 - the frameworks we're using
15:14 - then there's some redux in there that i
15:15 - need to learn and yeah that's kind of
15:17 - what i've been doing this summer is you
15:19 - know learning typescript react redux and
15:21 - writing code for microsoft with that
15:23 - so i kind of skipped over some things at
15:25 - the end because it got really close to
15:27 - the current date
15:28 - uh but hopefully that gives you an idea
15:29 - of everything that i've learned
15:31 - programming so to go through a quick
15:32 - summary i have a list here i'm just
15:34 - gonna walk through all of them in case i
15:36 - confused any of you
15:37 - we started with html then javascript
15:40 - then php
15:41 - c-sharp python a bunch of modules and
15:44 - stuff in python i spent pretty much two
15:45 - or three years just solely using python
15:48 - then i learned java then we learned some
15:50 - android development
15:51 - then we i learned sql which i guess you
15:53 - can't really consider a programming
15:55 - language but you get the point
15:56 - and then golang prolog scheme and then i
16:00 - learned typescript
16:01 - uh react redux which are frameworks
16:03 - obviously
16:04 - and then dart for the use in a flutter
16:06 - application
16:07 - so that is kind of my timeline and story
16:10 - learning to code
16:11 - there's a lot more i could go into i
16:13 - could literally spend hours talking
16:14 - about this journey and this story
16:15 - because i remember it so vividly and
16:17 - it's something that
16:18 - i think is really cool and i always like
16:19 - to share but with that being said i
16:21 - think
16:22 - i'm going to end the video here so if
16:24 - you guys enjoyed please do make sure you
