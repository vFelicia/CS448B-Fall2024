00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back so
00:01 - we're not the YouTube video so in
00:03 - today's video what I'm going to be doing
00:05 - is reviewing / reacting to an old Python
00:08 - project of mine notice a project I made
00:10 - in grade 11 and this is actually the
00:12 - first ever real Python project of mine
00:15 - what I mean by realist it's the first
00:17 - one that I was kind of proud of it was
00:18 - the first one that I really put a lot of
00:20 - effort into and that was kind of passed
00:22 - like four or five hundred lines so
00:24 - actually something that took more than
00:25 - just a few days this took a few weeks
00:27 - and maybe actually even about a month to
00:29 - make so keep in mind I did this when I
00:30 - was about sixteen seventeen and the
00:32 - reason I'm reviewing this is because I
00:34 - know that I made so many horrible
00:37 - mistakes in the codebase and I think
00:39 - it's gonna be kind of funny to go back
00:40 - and look at how much I've changed since
00:42 - then and then point out some of those
00:44 - mistakes and hopefully by doing that you
00:46 - guys can look at a few mistakes that you
00:49 - should not make one year programming so
00:51 - with that being said let me actually go
00:52 - ahead and do a quick demo of this game
00:54 - and then after that we'll get into the
00:56 - the code review so this is the game it's
00:58 - called super mini-golf and this is
01:00 - largely inspired by a game on the App
01:03 - Store called super stickman golf I used
01:05 - to play this game all the time with my
01:07 - friends at lunch probably in grade 11
01:09 - and grade 12 and well that's why it kind
01:12 - of inspired me to make this I wanted to
01:13 - recreate my own version of it on the
01:15 - computer alright so I'm in the game now
01:17 - I'm not sure if you guys can hear the
01:18 - sound effects I have them kind of
01:19 - faintly paying in the playing in the
01:21 - background but there is some music and
01:23 - sound effects when you do specific
01:24 - things in this game and the first thing
01:26 - I'll show you is actually the ball shop
01:27 - now I won't spend too much time on it
01:29 - but here you can equip different balls
01:30 - so you can the kind of the objective is
01:33 - you collect coins and then you can
01:34 - purchase different balls and you can see
01:36 - I can equipped let's say like the
01:37 - Aqualand here so I'll use that one if I
01:39 - wanted to purchase one I could select it
01:41 - it will bring up this window and then I
01:42 - can press yes or no
01:43 - so let's actually get into the game
01:45 - we'll start my first level we can see we
01:47 - go to level 1 and I'll just play through
01:48 - level 1 so you guys get an idea of kind
01:50 - of how the physics work and the bounces
01:52 - and then I'm gonna skip through a few of
01:54 - them and show you some of the later
01:55 - levels because those ones are kind of
01:56 - cool so immediately you'll notice
01:58 - there's kind of a power bar in that
01:59 - bottom left hand corner and to shoot the
02:01 - ball it's just all with the mouse you
02:02 - press down once starts the power press
02:04 - again it locks the power and then it
02:06 - shoots you aim by just moving the mouse
02:08 - around you can go close far it doesn't
02:11 - matter and then there's power ups so
02:12 - there's power shop
02:13 - and sticky ball those the power-ups that
02:15 - you can use so you'll notice that here
02:17 - there's actually this pink or purple II
02:19 - kind of substance on the wall and that
02:21 - is a sticky pad so if you hit that you
02:23 - actually stick to it and then this laser
02:25 - does laser is another hazard so if you
02:27 - run into it you lose a stroke now I'm
02:29 - just gonna skip through all the levels
02:30 - and get to kind of the end screen here
02:32 - just to show you what that looks like
02:34 - but again a really cool game I made all
02:36 - these levels myself a little bit of
02:37 - inspiration from that original game but
02:39 - you'll see when we get to the code
02:41 - review how difficult it was to actually
02:42 - kind of design these levels even though
02:44 - it is this little 2d thing there's all
02:46 - these different objects we have to check
02:48 - for collision with and while it gets
02:49 - pretty complicated pretty fast and lets
02:52 - go and it says noobest course completed
02:54 - 40 14 strokes par 40 score negative 26
02:57 - coins collected to press the mouse to
02:59 - continue and that is the game demo so
03:02 - let's go ahead and get into the code
03:03 - review after a quick word from our
03:05 - sponsor I need to thank simply learned
03:07 - for sponsoring this video and introduce
03:08 - you to the machine learning

03:44 - integrated laps after completion of this
03:46 - course you will receive a certificate
03:48 - from simply learned to testify to your
03:50 - skills in machine learning
03:51 - get started today by hitting the link in
03:53 - the description all right so now we're
03:55 - onto the code review which is gonna be
03:57 - very interesting because I do not
03:59 - remember exactly how I wrote this code
04:01 - so it's gonna be yeah interesting to say
04:03 - the least on how I'm actually going to
04:05 - understand what's going on in here I'll
04:07 - try my best to explain it but again this
04:10 - was 3-4 years ago so god knows if I'm
04:12 - gonna remember what happened in here
04:14 - anyways we can see that I have four
04:16 - Python files here so I have courses dot
04:18 - PI main dot PI physics dot PI and start
04:21 - screened out PI this is where all the
04:23 - codes written I did not organize things
04:25 - all nicely into different classes
04:27 - with a structure which I probably should
04:29 - have done because you're gonna see that
04:30 - main dot pie is like a few thousand
04:32 - lines of code and then I have been nice
04:34 - this is just the Python virtual
04:36 - environment I have sounds at least I put
04:38 - all of the sounds in their own folder so
04:40 - there is actually music and sound
04:42 - effects for the game but I can't play
04:43 - them just cuz I don't know if they're
04:45 - copyright or not so I don't want to uh
04:46 - to risk that and then images these are
04:49 - all the images of all the different
04:50 - things in there so like the icon like
04:53 - the laser there was some other levels
04:55 - where I added some more things that we
04:57 - didn't see the power bar sand the title
05:01 - right water all these different things
05:03 - so that is all the images and now let's
05:05 - actually just get started on let's keep
05:07 - the smaller module first so this is the
05:10 - physics module so as you noticed all of
05:13 - the stuff in this game actually worked
05:15 - off of like pretty realistic physics
05:16 - like the bounce was working pretty good
05:18 - flying through the air was working
05:20 - pretty well and this is based strictly
05:21 - off of projectile motion which you learn
05:24 - in grade 11 so since I actually knew
05:26 - projectile motion because I was pretty
05:27 - good at physics in high school I was
05:29 - able to actually implement a fairly
05:31 - realistic kind of physics simulator that
05:33 - I wrote from scratch I didn't use any
05:35 - module or anything from this and this
05:36 - was the main kind of I don't know module
05:39 - or brains behind the physics so ball
05:41 - paths we have a start X a start Y a
05:44 - power and an angle and the amount of
05:46 - time and this simply calculates at what
05:49 - like what coordinate this ball should be
05:51 - at given it start at this X that Y had a
05:54 - power angle and time and then of course
05:55 - gravity is built in at negative 9.8
05:58 - meters per second which I probably
05:59 - should have changed that but actually I
06:00 - ended up working fairly well for this
06:02 - project so you can see this is ball path
06:04 - that's what that function does find
06:06 - power this just finds the amount of
06:08 - power based on where that line was on
06:11 - the power meter because that angle the
06:14 - angle off the line determines how much
06:16 - power are you gonna shoot with so I had
06:17 - to figure that out in here find angle I
06:20 - don't actually know what that does I
06:23 - don't remember and then max time don't
06:25 - remember what that does either but those
06:27 - were this is like the physics module and
06:29 - now I'll go into maned up high and then
06:30 - I'll talk about the other ones so maned
06:32 - up high let me just scroll through here
06:34 - is what is it oh yes oh it's a thousand
06:37 - lines of code so I exaggerated a bit but
06:39 - it is a signal
06:40 - an amount of code considering none of
06:42 - its like broken up into functions at all
06:44 - it's just this massive massive while
06:47 - statement others too so there's one for
06:49 - the Start screen and then there's one
06:50 - that just boom for the entire main game
06:52 - loop so you can imagine that like if I
06:54 - want to fix anything oh my god this is
06:57 - gonna be like literally impossible
06:58 - trying to figure out where anything is
07:00 - because there's like Elif Elif Elif Elif
07:03 - Elif Elif everywhere so not the most
07:06 - readable thing well we'll start from the
07:07 - top to bottom and then we'll keep going
07:08 - alright so I load up all the stuff I'm
07:10 - fine with this all these images I
07:13 - probably have made these capitals as
07:14 - they're constants but that's fine we
07:16 - have our global variables here yeah I
07:21 - didn't put anything in classes this was
07:23 - all like this is a very functional was
07:26 - it very functional program if you want
07:28 - to put it that way
07:29 - and yeah so loading all the music power
07:31 - up variables fonts and there is one
07:36 - class I guess I wrote which is the score
07:37 - sheet so let's have a look at this all
07:39 - right so so par with two R's nice okay
07:43 - self dot parlous par I'm not seeing
07:45 - anything that's like hurting my head too
07:47 - horribly except for these just massive
07:50 - methods so draw sheet I mean I'm okay
07:52 - with this but I really don't like seeing
07:55 - huge blocks of code where they're
07:56 - definitely doing more than one thing and
07:58 - like that's the huge thing with this
07:59 - this program here this is just this huge
08:02 - blocks and just chunks of code and I I
08:04 - can't immediately tell you what all
08:06 - these things they're doing and and these
08:07 - kind of things but should probably have
08:09 - gone in their own method at least so
08:11 - they would have been easier to change
08:12 - and mess around although I did add some
08:14 - decent comments so setup grid column
08:16 - lines rows display all headers for rows
08:18 - so at least I did that so that's not
08:20 - horrible catch the index out of range
08:22 - error display strokes each level mmm try
08:25 - catch I don't know why I needed that but
08:27 - I guess I did and then we go down to
08:29 - error so this is displays an error
08:32 - message if you try to buy yeah out of
08:34 - power-ups you have no more powers
08:35 - remaining for this course okay so that's
08:37 - what that does n screen this is what
08:40 - handles the main loop for the end screen
08:41 - again right like just all this code oh
08:44 - my god
08:45 - rewrite the text file containing the
08:47 - scores draw all the stuff on the screen
08:49 - I should have put that in its own
08:50 - function global variables
08:53 - we don't want to do that do we but a
08:54 - bunch of global variables so obviously
08:56 - nothing in this project we can take out
08:58 - and reuse it's all just now completely
09:01 - tied together there's no chance that we
09:03 - can even take small sections of this
09:05 - other than the physics module and move
09:07 - it anywhere so that's an absolute mess
09:09 - old score old coins file okay I am
09:13 - noticing that when I name variables I'm
09:15 - not doing camelcase
09:17 - or underscores I'm just doing if you
09:19 - guys can see here the actual name which
09:22 - is not usually a good thing to be doing
09:23 - I have a lot of like one letter variable
09:26 - names which just make it really hard to
09:28 - read like F L wouldn't be doing that
09:31 - anymore Co like I have no idea what Co
09:34 - stands for and I probably could have
09:36 - named that something more descriptive
09:38 - wait okay
09:40 - while loop for events yeah like just a
09:43 - lot of stuff that just doesn't make any
09:44 - sense when you come back and read it
09:46 - which is obviously something you want to
09:47 - avoid and then this just massive
09:49 - diagonal code indentation levels so
09:52 - let's try to decipher some of this set
09:55 - up level okay and maybe that makes sense
09:57 - starting shop click ok so this is
10:00 - handling the main menu it looks like
10:03 - potentially any ways set up what is this
10:06 - view set up set up objects for the level
10:08 - from module courses okay so now what I'm
10:10 - gonna do is go to courses and show you
10:12 - how I actually built these courses so
10:14 - notice that I had like all the lines
10:16 - there and I had these just notice what
10:19 - the levels looked like there was
10:20 - platforms and there was like a sand trap
10:22 - and there was a flag well you're gonna
10:23 - see how I decided to do that so this is
10:27 - courses DUP I yeah just just here you
10:32 - guys can just just look so what I
10:35 - actually did is I defined objects by
10:39 - strings so like a floor was denoted by
10:42 - floor and that corresponds to the image
10:44 - here which is where sit do we have a
10:48 - floor somewhere platform floor green
10:52 - icon laser power tile title water sticky
10:56 - sand edge sand bottom so sand bottom
10:59 - potentially I don't know there's
11:00 - something that was a floor like
11:01 - something is a floor one of the images
11:03 - anyways so if we go back to courses top
11:06 - I though
11:07 - you can see that I denote what the
11:09 - object was by string and then I put the
11:11 - position that I want it to be at so 0
11:14 - negative 8 1224 okay so I believe what
11:18 - I'm saying here is the this is gonna be
11:22 - the X I believe this is the Y and I
11:25 - believe this is how long and how high it
11:26 - is yeah I think that's what it is so
11:28 - this is X Y width height that's what I'm
11:31 - defining here and you can see I have
11:33 - hard-coded window width and window
11:34 - height up here which is just not a good
11:36 - thing to do and I'm using those
11:37 - variables up here so no you cannot
11:39 - change the window height and the width
11:40 - and I literally went in and manually
11:42 - added all of the objects rather than
11:45 - building some kind of like level builder
11:47 - or something which probably would have
11:48 - been easier and then I put all of them
11:50 - in a list for the courses so course 1 is
11:53 - denoted by just all of this and if you
11:55 - want to move anything well have fun
11:57 - trying to figure out where they are
11:58 - heart and what is what I have these
12:00 - functions in here that are meant to just
12:02 - help get you like a few things from
12:04 - these levels so they get you the par
12:06 - they get you whatever you like whatever
12:09 - else is here gets start Oh getting the
12:11 - start position that's because inside of
12:13 - all of these I have something that's
12:14 - labeled to start I believe let's see if
12:17 - there's anything called start well maybe
12:19 - not but there's like there's some way
12:22 - that we define like where people start
12:24 - and where the green is and where the
12:25 - flags are and all of that that's just a
12:27 - mess that's courses PI yeah and so set
12:31 - up I guess is handling some of that the
12:33 - course is up I couldn't even tell you
12:35 - and then I have some other functions
12:36 - here so fade fade up the screen when
12:38 - player gets hit by ball show score
12:40 - display the score from the class score
12:41 - sheet so these are ok I'm actually ok
12:43 - with some of these functions I can live
12:44 - with these one one if a player gets a
12:47 - hole-in-one display a special message
12:48 - screen ok that's fine I can do that ah
12:50 - displays stroke okay so this is based on
12:54 - what you get versus the par it gives you
12:57 - all of the the names right so like oh I
13:00 - didn't even know what these were what
13:01 - things albatraoz negative for skipped
13:03 - Eagle birdie par bogey double bogey
13:06 - triple bogey so on and then plus
13:08 - whatever that's okay redraw window this
13:11 - is meant to handle all the redrawing so
13:13 - this actually uses that courses you can
13:15 - see I have sand water edge bottom flag
13:17 - floor green wall laser sticky coin and
13:19 - then of course there's a ball
13:21 - somewhere that I'm drawing although I
13:23 - don't know where it is but essentially I
13:25 - just load in a list of objects and then
13:27 - draw all of them based on what string
13:29 - they have using the correct image so
13:31 - that's how this draw thing works I mean
13:33 - I couldn't really come up with a better
13:34 - way to do that now I probably would but
13:38 - that's how I went about doing it
13:39 - coin image this calculates the spinning
13:41 - coin so how it spins
13:42 - PowerBar this handles out power by
13:45 - moving back and forth find angle I think
13:48 - is a duplicate of something else
13:49 - oh no find the angle that the ball hits
13:51 - the ground out so good I have that
13:52 - comment but that's actually pretty hard
13:54 - to do if you think about it like you
13:56 - have this ball which is a circular
13:57 - object first of all that's coming down
13:59 - and then you got to figure out what
14:00 - angle it hit set so you can bounce off
14:02 - at the corresponding angle and then
14:04 - reduce power core accordingly so that's
14:07 - interesting on green this tells us if
14:09 - we're on the green because if we're on
14:11 - the green you go into puttting mode so
14:13 - we need to know if that's true over
14:15 - whole this tells us if the ball is over
14:18 - the hole so that we know if it went in
14:19 - or not so that's interesting and now
14:22 - yeah we get into this main game loop
14:25 - collision a ball looking angle locking
14:28 - angle and power checking if powerup
14:30 - buttons are clicked shooting the ball
14:31 - using physics module keeping track of
14:33 - strokes and calls all functions and uses
14:35 - module slash class is important to find
14:36 - above yeah so like we should not do all
14:39 - of that in one area which is what I did
14:41 - but you can see that like this is just
14:43 - an absolute mess so this is the screen
14:45 - the Start screen sorry and what do we do
14:48 - Start screen
14:49 - main screen so I believe if I go to
14:52 - Start screen
14:53 - ball so class ball okay interesting I
14:57 - didn't even use a capital there and
14:59 - where's the Start screen somewhere in
15:02 - here main screen so I believe that
15:04 - displays some stuff mouse over like
15:07 - there's just so much code it's hard to
15:10 - wrap my head around all of it now but
15:12 - draw shop oh my gosh just whenever you
15:15 - see these cascading if statements it
15:17 - just can never be a good thing and I
15:18 - just yeah I'm not gonna skip that
15:20 - anyways let's go back here so display
15:23 - Start screen okay and so we say this
15:25 - Start screen works we get past that now
15:27 - we get into like the core of this is the
15:29 - most difficult part by far this main
15:31 - loop which actually handles all the
15:32 - physics so first of all this is Han
15:35 - all the power-ups so depending on which
15:37 - one you hit do something right and I
15:40 - don't even know what all these x4 like
15:43 - what is X I don't I don't know what that
15:45 - is I shouldn't have used one letter
15:48 - variable names for X in powerup buttons
15:50 - yeah this is just so interesting I don't
15:52 - I don't know what those are event dot
15:55 - type so this is if you press the mouse
15:57 - button down we can see that this is
16:00 - checking the collision of the powerup
16:01 - buttons and then this is clicking if you
16:04 - click the powerup buttons but you don't
16:05 - lock the angle then it doesn't work so
16:07 - you have to actually lock the angle
16:09 - first if we haven't locked powers stay
16:11 - in this loop until we do so this is
16:13 - waiting for you to actually lock the
16:15 - power for that arm to spit to go back
16:17 - and forth change the position of the
16:20 - angle line so this is Mouse motion what
16:23 - the heck oh so that's based on if I move
16:27 - my mouse left or right that changes how
16:29 - that power bar moves so that's there's a
16:31 - lot of complicated stuff here
16:32 - redraw window crates and now another
16:35 - while loop so while putt and not shoot
16:37 - so if you're putting but we aren't in
16:39 - the shooting mode yet and if we aren't
16:41 - over the hole then do this otherwise do
16:45 - all of this right so you can just see
16:46 - that this is a mess like at least I
16:47 - commented it so I can read it but it's
16:49 - just so many things happening in one
16:51 - place and so many horrible names and
16:53 - inconsistency like I'm using camelcase
16:55 - here and then I use snake case other
16:57 - places and then I have just s like that
16:59 - with no camel case at all all these
17:02 - random constants throwing up like just
17:05 - these magic numbers everywhere like Pi
17:07 - game time ductile 8:20 like Y 20 why did
17:09 - I pick 20 I have no idea while shoot so
17:13 - while we're in the shooting mode so now
17:14 - this is responsible for actually moving
17:16 - the ball which is oh my gosh yeah
17:18 - collision loop very complex I love how I
17:22 - stated that so if as if everything else
17:24 - wasn't to fix glitch where you go
17:25 - through walls and floors great right
17:27 - like this is these are my solutions to
17:29 - common problems to just comment in all
17:31 - capitals this fixes the glitch don't
17:34 - remove it to leave it there okay
17:36 - collision loop very complex all angles
17:38 - are in radians physics are in jet in
17:40 - general real and correct that's actually
17:41 - true I know I did a decent job on the
17:43 - physics and oh my god so if I for equals
17:46 - coins so if we collided with a
17:48 - coin then check if we collided and do
17:52 - this if we collided with a laser check
17:55 - the exact same thing we did up here
17:56 - except with the laser and do all of this
17:59 - if we collided with water that do all of
18:02 - this we're I'm sure like most of this is
18:04 - the same stuff that I've just repeated
18:06 - like in all of these loops if we hit the
18:08 - flag where we hit the coin do all of
18:10 - this and recalculate the angles and all
18:12 - of that it's just so much reused and
18:14 - repetitive code and it just makes it
18:16 - like we can see here literally
18:17 - impossible to understand at all so
18:20 - honestly with that I feel like I've
18:22 - probably dragged this video on long
18:24 - enough I could go through and review
18:25 - this for like hours and talk about it
18:27 - but I just wanted to to show you guys
18:29 - that what my first kind of real Python
18:32 - project looked like an absolute mess no
18:35 - idea of design practices I used like one
18:37 - class or two classes inside of here I
18:40 - had no idea the proper way to do this
18:42 - and I just jumped into this huge project
18:44 - with no real planning and well you can
18:46 - see that it just turned into something
18:48 - that's really cool that I'm definitely
18:49 - still proud of that I was able to create
18:50 - but just an absolute colossal mess and
18:53 - this should show you why it's hopefully
18:55 - important that you're applying good
18:57 - practices when you're coding so that if
18:59 - you want to look back at a project in
19:01 - two years you have some idea what the
19:03 - heck is going on
19:04 - so anyways with that being said I hope
19:05 - you all enjoyed if you did make sure you
19:07 - leave a like subscribe to the channel
19:09 - and let me know what you thought of my
19:11 - first Python project
