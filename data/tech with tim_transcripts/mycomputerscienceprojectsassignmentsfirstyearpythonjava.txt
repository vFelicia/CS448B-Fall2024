00:00 - hey guys and welcome to a brand new
00:01 - video where I'm gonna be showing you all
00:03 - of the projects and assignments I had to
00:05 - complete during my first year of
00:07 - university majoring in computer science
00:09 - so those of you that are new here I'm 18
00:11 - years old I just finished my first year
00:13 - of computer science and throughout
00:15 - computer science what we were doing was
00:16 - learning Python and Java so kind of some
00:19 - fundamentals of programming and you guys
00:20 - gonna see that throughout this video if
00:22 - you guys are new here I post videos like
00:24 - this explaining and talking about my
00:26 - experience as a computer science student
00:27 - and I also do all kinds of tutorials
00:30 - mainly on the Python programming
00:31 - language that will definitely help you
00:33 - guys get ahead in your courses so make
00:34 - sure to subscribe if you're not already
00:36 - so with that being said let's get into
00:38 - the video and look at all of the
00:39 - assignments and projects I had to do
00:41 - throughout my first year alright so the
00:44 - first assignments and projects I'm gonna
00:45 - show you are from my first programming
00:47 - class which was called ITI 1120 and it
00:51 - was basic Python programming and just
00:53 - kind of an introduction to computer
00:55 - science and programming in general this
00:57 - was probably the easiest class I've ever
00:59 - taken almost I want to consider it
01:02 - throughout high school as well in that
01:04 - consideration of classes I did not work
01:06 - very hard in this course at all I
01:08 - finished most of the assignments the day
01:10 - that they were assigned and again that's
01:12 - not to brag it's just to really tell you
01:14 - that how simple this course actually was
01:16 - if you guys do any programming outside
01:18 - of school you will be more than fine in
01:20 - your first programming class so this is
01:22 - the first assignment that we had to do
01:23 - I'm not really gonna go through it much
01:25 - because it's super basic and really
01:26 - boring essentially we just had to create
01:28 - a ton of very basic functions that
01:31 - answered like super simple questions and
01:33 - at this point they didn't even teach us
01:35 - like loops for most things and if you
01:37 - use the loop that was like advanced um
01:39 - she has to get the point like draw car
01:41 - this was the most advanced one we had to
01:42 - draw a car using the turtle graphics
01:44 - module cad cashier calculates the change
01:48 - in canadian dollars that a user should
01:50 - receive because in canada we don't have
01:51 - one cent so it has surrounded everything
01:53 - to five just really basic stuff like
01:56 - that and that was assignment 1 now
01:58 - assignment 2 was not much more difficult
02:01 - but I will open it up here for you and
02:03 - it was an increasing split tester but
02:07 - essentially what an increasing split
02:08 - tester did was given any number so like
02:11 - type in like a 10
02:12 - or something then you give it a split
02:14 - and the split will be the number at
02:17 - which its split so for example if you
02:19 - had it to contend length number and you
02:22 - put a split of two then every two digits
02:24 - would be split off and it would check if
02:26 - those two digits like in order were
02:29 - increasing I'm actually gonna run the
02:30 - program for you guys to show you how
02:32 - this works but this is all of the code
02:34 - again really straightforward what is
02:36 - your name Tim would you like to put a
02:41 - number in yes enter your positive number
02:42 - so you have one two three four five six
02:44 - seven eight and I give it a split of
02:46 - let's say four then we see we get a
02:48 - sequence of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and the
02:50 - sequence is increasing because while
02:52 - this number is smaller than this one and
02:54 - you can go through and mess with that
02:56 - program and you see how that kind of
02:57 - works so that was part one of assignment
02:59 - 2
03:00 - all right on to assignment 3 now this
03:03 - one was a card game not super difficult
03:05 - but definitely more advanced than some
03:07 - of the other stuff and I'll show you how
03:10 - the card game works now by running the
03:11 - program but I think the point of this
03:14 - assignment was to get you comfortable
03:15 - using lists alright so this is a rummy
03:17 - game it's like a different rummy game
03:20 - but let's see the standard deck has 52
03:22 - cards 13 ranks 4 suits would you like to
03:24 - change the number of cards by changing
03:26 - the number of ranks I'm just gonna say
03:27 - no but you can do that if you want to
03:29 - here you're playing with a deck of 52
03:31 - cards as your starting hand welcome to
03:34 - round 1 please roll the dice see you
03:36 - roll the dice it's just simulating a
03:37 - card game for you essentially and then
03:39 - what you have to do is look at these
03:42 - which are representation of cards and
03:44 - figure out whether you have like I don't
03:46 - know what it's called but you're trying
03:49 - to create like groupings of cards to get
03:51 - rid of cards from your hand so I think I
03:54 - can like do you have a sequence of 3
03:56 - more cards of the same suit or two or
03:58 - more of a kind I think I do so I'll just
04:00 - say yes let's see what ones would I even
04:03 - have 110 for 10 those would be the same
04:07 - card so if I do that then it removes
04:09 - those two cards and I can just keep
04:10 - going until I don't have any more
04:11 - sequences or pairs to remove so
04:14 - assignment 4 is where things got
04:15 - slightly more difficult and at least
04:17 - some of my classmates struggled quite a
04:19 - bit I didn't find this one that
04:20 - difficult but again I'm me
04:23 - so yeah so anyways what this one is like
04:26 - kind of
04:26 - a social networking kind of thing where
04:29 - there's these massive lists of actually
04:32 - not load this one it would be one of
04:33 - friends so like zero is friend with 100
04:36 - zero is friend with 101 and you can see
04:38 - that this list is something like what
04:40 - like 10,000 lines long and it just has a
04:42 - pair of all these different friends and
04:44 - essentially your program has to answer a
04:46 - bunch of different questions looking
04:48 - through the network and doing it in a
04:50 - certain time complexity so the point of
04:52 - this was to teach you like binary search
04:54 - trees or not binary search tree sorry
04:56 - just binary search as opposed to linear
04:58 - search in different ways of kind of
05:00 - being a bit more efficient with some of
05:02 - your code because some of this stuff can
05:03 - take a long time so if I go to them to
05:05 - the bottom here this is the main line of
05:07 - the program and I'll run it for you guys
05:10 - see an idea of exactly how it works
05:12 - before hi so enter the name of the file
05:15 - in this case I am just gonna use big txt
05:17 - like that and then what it says is the
05:22 - average number of friends is nineteen
05:24 - point seven eight in the social network
05:26 - the maximum number of friends any person
05:27 - has is 347 there are one people with 347
05:31 - friends and their ideas ID 0 now pick a
05:34 - number at random that number is 43 let's
05:36 - see how many people have that many
05:37 - friends there's 119 people with 43 or
05:39 - more friends there's nobody that knows
05:41 - everybody we are now ready to recommend
05:44 - a friend for user you specify so this is
05:46 - like a friend recommendation system the
05:48 - way it works is just it finds like the
05:50 - amount of friends in common and then
05:52 - picks someone or something like that I
05:55 - don't remember let's do like ID 4 for
05:58 - the user with ID 4 we recommend the user
05:59 - with ID 339 this is because users 4 and
06:02 - 339 have two common friends and user 4
06:05 - does not have more common friends than
06:06 - anyone else so honestly this one was a
06:08 - bit more interesting and I found this
06:10 - one more cool kind of shows you how like
06:12 - the Facebook network all that kind of
06:14 - stuff I works on like a very very very
06:17 - basic level and now time to go into a
06:20 - Simon fine so assignment 5 is now in 10
06:23 - just more more functions I'm pretty sure
06:25 - actually let me go down here oh no this
06:29 - one was like a dictionary thing so the
06:31 - way that this worked is there's a bunch
06:33 - of if I can find it here like
06:35 - dictionaries and it's like a
06:37 - word lookup system or something I don't
06:40 - remember how this works to be honest I
06:43 - think I'm just gonna have to run the
06:44 - heat code and see so let's run a five
06:47 - part one and see what we get so alright
06:49 - so now enter the name of the file in
06:51 - this case I'll do war and peace dot txt
06:58 - it's gonna open up the file read in
07:00 - every single line says enter one or more
07:02 - words separated by spaces or cue to quit
07:05 - so what this is gonna do this I just got
07:07 - a quick refresher here is you gonna type
07:09 - in words and then it's gonna find the
07:11 - lines in the file that have all of those
07:14 - different words now the point of this
07:16 - was to be using dictionaries and sets so
07:18 - that things happen very very quickly and
07:20 - you kind of get an idea of the time
07:22 - complex the difference between a
07:23 - dictionary and something like a list for
07:26 - example because we're reading in like
07:27 - tens of thousands of lines of text so I
07:30 - do like hello and my or something like
07:32 - that the words you enter do not coexist
07:35 - in the same line okay let's just do like
07:36 - hello and see the word hello is not in
07:39 - the file okay this is great
07:40 - let's try I don't even know what like a
07:44 - common phrases let's do the so these are
07:47 - all of the lines that exists on
07:49 - obviously like almost every line in the
07:52 - file if I do that and my then you can
07:55 - see that all of these lines are the ones
07:58 - that contain those two words together if
08:01 - I do like this is mine then these are
08:05 - the three lines that contain those three
08:07 - words not necessarily in that order and
08:09 - if I do put Q then I can quit and that
08:12 - is kind of how this works now part two
08:15 - of this assignment was just
08:16 - understanding a little bit more about
08:17 - objects we had to create all these
08:19 - different objects and just use some
08:21 - basic Python what do you call it like
08:24 - methods and stuff like that
08:25 - but that was kind of it for all of the
08:27 - first programming class very very basic
08:30 - and again you guys get it that it's just
08:31 - introducing you to the Python
08:33 - programming language so now it is time
08:35 - to go over to the Java course which got
08:37 - a little bit more interesting with some
08:39 - more in different kind of projects all
08:42 - right so now time time to talk about my
08:43 - second programming class which I took
08:45 - last semester my second semester in
08:47 - computer science and this was a job
08:50 - ramming course so essentially the point
08:52 - of this one was to kind of teach you
08:54 - about interfaces programming structure
08:56 - object-oriented design and some more
08:58 - advanced computer science topics they
09:00 - did not really teach Java syntax
09:02 - whatsoever it was just computer science
09:06 - like course to taught in Java so you
09:09 - were kind of assumed to have known the
09:11 - Java syntax which most people did not
09:12 - and you had to learn on your own and
09:14 - then they just kind of gave you a bunch
09:16 - of assignments and labs and all that and
09:18 - you just did it now this was definitely
09:20 - a more challenging program class again
09:22 - not two not crazy difficult in my eyes
09:25 - but they also taught us about data
09:26 - structures and things like breadth-first
09:29 - search and like tree like hash maps and
09:34 - trees and all that kind of stuff and
09:36 - binary search trees and more theoretical
09:38 - things as opposed to really practical
09:41 - programming in my opinion now there's a
09:44 - lot of assignments here and there's a
09:45 - ton of code so I'm not gonna go through
09:47 - all of them because the way that you
09:48 - code in Java is with tons of different
09:50 - classes if you guys aren't aware these
09:52 - projects took a lot longer to complete
09:54 - usually I had to work on them over a few
09:56 - days or maybe even a few weeks but I
09:58 - will run some of them so you guys get an
09:59 - idea of what I created
10:01 - now the first assignment and this one
10:03 - was like within the first month of being
10:05 - in this class was just to recreate our
10:07 - assignment three from our ITI 1120 class
10:10 - which was in python so essentially that
10:12 - rummy game that I showed you exact same
10:14 - thing just ran in Java so if I do I'll
10:17 - just do a yes here and pick four ranks
10:20 - and you can see here that we get really
10:22 - the same kind of thing just deck is a
10:24 - little bit different same game as before
10:27 - so I'm not really gonna go through this
10:28 - that much that was assignment one
10:29 - assignment two was dealing with
10:32 - ArrayList and breadth-first search now I
10:35 - can't actually run this code for you
10:37 - because it runs on unit tests which I
10:39 - don't have but essentially what it was
10:41 - meant to do was find the shortest
10:43 - possible solution to what's known as a
10:46 - lights-out game which I'm gonna show you
10:48 - in just one second as a graphical
10:50 - representation because that's what our
10:51 - third project was so our third project
10:54 - was essentially using all of the code
10:56 - from the second project that we created
10:58 - and making a GUI using swing and Java so
11:02 - let me run this one for you guys right
11:03 - now
11:03 - and you guys will get an idea of what I
11:05 - mean by this okay so when I run this now
11:08 - you can see that we get a nice beautiful
11:10 - little GUI that pops up here that is not
11:13 - resizable that allows us to play this
11:16 - game called lights-out now the way the
11:17 - lights-out works is you try to
11:19 - essentially get all of the lights on
11:21 - this board to be lit up in the shortest
11:23 - amount of steps now you can see it shows
11:25 - the steps in the bottom corner and this
11:27 - is actually way harder than it looks
11:29 - now the challenging part with this is we
11:31 - had to make the solution solver for this
11:33 - so essentially what we had to do is be
11:35 - able to put solution and then after
11:38 - running some crazy algorithm that
11:39 - actually takes a really long time to run
11:41 - that's why this is still going it's
11:43 - gonna show you the lit up steps that you
11:46 - need to take to well complete this game
11:48 - so just give this one second and that we
11:50 - should hopefully see it alright so after
11:52 - running that and you can see it took a
11:54 - fair amount of time it tells me what I
11:55 - need to click to actually complete this
11:57 - game so I'll go ahead and click on those
12:00 - I made this it's kind of hard to see
12:03 - like which ones you need to click on but
12:04 - if you just go ahead and follow it then
12:07 - you can see that you can complete the
12:08 - game it says congratulations you want in
12:09 - 21 steps you want to play again sure
12:12 - let's play again
12:13 - and then if you go random it'll just
12:14 - randomly put ones on the screen like
12:16 - that and obviously you can go around and
12:18 - click them and the hard part was
12:20 - obviously getting that solution to work
12:21 - like that so this is a nice little Java
12:24 - QE probably one of the more fun projects
12:26 - we had to do because he actually get to
12:27 - work with some of the graphical user
12:28 - interface all right so my file
12:30 - assignment assignment for this was the
12:33 - last one that we had to complete it was
12:34 - actually had to be handed in like the
12:35 - last day of exams and essentially what
12:39 - this one was was a plagiarism checker
12:41 - now what it did was it took two files
12:43 - and it compared the similarity between
12:46 - the files now this was actually meant to
12:48 - teach us about linked structures and
12:51 - tree structures so we did linked lists
12:54 - doubly linked lists singly linked linked
12:58 - lists tree structures we did word maps
13:01 - all this kind of crazy stuff just to
13:04 - compare the speed difference between
13:06 - these because actually having to compare
13:08 - the similarity between two different
13:09 - documents depending on the way that you
13:12 - do that can take a really long time so
13:13 - this was a good kind of way to show why
13:16 - you would want
13:16 - certain down structure and set them up
13:18 - so you can see this is the
13:19 - implementation of a linked list and we
13:21 - have to do all kinds of stuff like that
13:23 - like for example test word map like this
13:27 - and these are just unit tests for
13:28 - certain things I'm not gonna run this
13:30 - for you guys because I don't even really
13:32 - remember how to do that cuz it's been a
13:34 - while since I wrote this but that's kind
13:36 - of what this last one was and it just
13:39 - looked at these kind of documents here
13:41 - or sorry this where is it this data here
13:44 - and we'll compare the similarity between
13:46 - any given documents that you gave it so
13:49 - anyways that has kind of been it for all
13:51 - of the projects that I did in my first
13:53 - year of computer science I know this
13:56 - video is long but I hopefully you guys
13:58 - got an idea of some of the different
13:59 - things that you guys will be doing in
14:01 - computer science and maybe whether or
14:03 - not your skill level is kind of up to
14:04 - par if you want to do a little bit of
14:06 - practice before maybe you start next
14:08 - year with that being said if you guys
14:09 - like to see more stuff like this and be
14:11 - talking more about what I did during my
14:13 - first year of computer science
14:14 - definitely let me know know down below
14:16 - and with that being said I will see you
14:18 - guys in another video
