00:00 - this is really going to dictate how much
00:01 - of a pain in the app it is to develop
00:03 - your project or your application it's
00:05 - very important that from the beginning
00:07 - of your software project that you
00:10 - actually determine what subsystems are
00:12 - going to make up the system as a whole
00:14 - now what I mean by this is rather than
00:15 - having say one massive code base that
00:18 - does everything right you want to break
00:20 - it into individual and kind of logical
00:22 - components which work together to solve
00:25 - a problem so maybe you have an
00:26 - authentication system you have a
00:28 - messaging system you have an achievement
00:30 - system you have all of these different
00:31 - subsystems they're a lot easier to write
00:33 - because you're only writing one at a
00:35 - time a lot easier to maintain a lot
00:37 - easier to debug to test and to scale up
00:40 - or scale down depending on what is
00:42 - required in your application
