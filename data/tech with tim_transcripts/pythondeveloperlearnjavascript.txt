00:00 - so moving on to my final recommendation
00:02 - I have something that is very
00:03 - complementary to Python and that is
00:05 - Javascript now JavaScript is my
00:07 - recommendation here because it meshes
00:09 - really well with python now with python
00:11 - you kind of have the back end you can
00:12 - create a web server you can hook up a
00:14 - database you can do all of that with
00:16 - python relatively easily then what you
00:18 - need is some front-end user interface so
00:20 - rather than using python to do that you
00:22 - can use JavaScript you can spin up a
00:24 - simple react server you can use
00:25 - something like angular it's very easy to
00:28 - go and build a project when you know
00:29 - languages like Python and JavaScript you
00:31 - kind of already are a full stack
00:33 - developer when you know these two
00:34 - languages they're the most popular
00:36 - there's tons of resources for them it's
00:38 - very easy to kind of get started with
00:40 - this quite quick
