00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - hello everybody and welcome to a brand
00:10 - new tutorial series on building a slack
00:13 - bot
00:13 - in python now i'll quickly introduce
00:15 - what slack is in case any of you are not
00:17 - aware
00:18 - but slack is just another messaging
00:20 - platform it's similar to something like
00:21 - discord maybe even comparable to
00:23 - something like microsoft teams
00:25 - i know a lot of large companies use
00:27 - slack for their main communication
00:29 - the nice thing with it is it's really
00:30 - easy to direct message people
00:33 - you can add teammates you have a bunch
00:35 - of different channels there's all kinds
00:36 - of emojis you can have some nice
00:38 - formatted messages
00:39 - i don't use slack all that often but a
00:41 - lot of you guys have been asking me to
00:43 - make a slack bot so i figured i would go
00:45 - ahead and make this tutorial series
00:47 - now in this series i'm going to be
00:49 - making kind of shorter videos aiming to
00:51 - have them about 10 to 15 minutes in
00:53 - length
00:53 - that show you kind of individual things
00:55 - so the first thing we're going to do in
00:57 - this video is just configure the slack
00:58 - bot which will actually take a good
01:00 - amount of time
01:01 - and then we'll actually add it into a
01:02 - channel and have it so it sends a
01:04 - message
01:05 - that will just show you the basics and
01:06 - the setup then from there what we'll do
01:09 - is we'll configure events so essentially
01:11 - allowing us to
01:12 - subscribe to specific events so if a
01:14 - user
01:15 - you know messages in a channel that will
01:17 - send us that
01:18 - message or send us an event that
01:20 - happened we can handle that event and
01:22 - then maybe we could reply to them
01:23 - we could track that message we can see
01:25 - if they send a command
01:26 - so on so forth we can do all kinds of
01:28 - stuff like that so you'll see what we're
01:30 - going to do later in the tutorial series
01:32 - but let's go ahead and get started
01:34 - the first thing we're going to need to
01:35 - do here is just make a new workspace
01:37 - so you can see right now i'm in the
01:39 - workspace i was using before
01:40 - i called it python api tutorial just the
01:42 - slack api
01:44 - i was just messing around before
01:46 - preparing for this tutorial
01:47 - but to create a new workspace you're
01:49 - going to have to obviously make an
01:50 - account on slack
01:51 - i'm going to assume you can figure out
01:52 - how to do that on your own and then if
01:54 - you're already in a workspace for some
01:56 - reason you can click on it and then
01:57 - click add
01:58 - workspace so i've already got that open
02:00 - here this is the page that will pop up
02:02 - when you press add workspace you need to
02:05 - insert an email
02:06 - i'll get my email to actually be blurred
02:08 - here i don't want you guys to see that
02:09 - and then i will click
02:10 - continue all right it's going to send me
02:12 - a confirmation code i'll go ahead and
02:14 - set this up and then once the workspace
02:15 - is ready i'll be right back
02:17 - all right so i went ahead and configured
02:19 - that i guess i'll just call this one
02:20 - slackbot tutorial
02:22 - i'll just label this one youtube so i
02:24 - can differentiate these two
02:26 - and now i have a new workspace i'm not
02:29 - going to add any
02:30 - teammates here let's skip that step and
02:33 - i guess we'll say hello team
02:35 - as our first message all right so here
02:37 - we are we are in our new workspace
02:39 - now what we're going to do is go ahead
02:41 - and head over to the slack api website
02:43 - all of the links here will be in the
02:44 - description you can find them down below
02:47 - and we're going to configure our first
02:49 - app so what i'm going to do is press on
02:51 - my app right here are your apps in the
02:53 - top corner
02:54 - you'll notice that i already have one
02:56 - right here your page may look a little
02:58 - bit different
02:58 - but all we're going to do is press
03:00 - create new app and go ahead and give it
03:02 - a name and then choose what workspace
03:04 - we want this to be in so i'm going to go
03:05 - ahead and name this one
03:07 - youtube bot like that
03:10 - and then i'll put this inside of
03:11 - slackbot tutorial for youtube
03:14 - all right so create app and now you can
03:16 - see we're on the kind of the dashboard
03:18 - here and we're gonna have to do is
03:19 - configure a bunch of different things
03:21 - so the first thing that we're going to
03:23 - do here is we're actually going to go
03:24 - ahead and go to bots
03:26 - like this and we're going to go to
03:27 - review scopes and add so essentially we
03:30 - need to give our bot permissions
03:32 - for whatever it's going to be doing in
03:34 - the channel so we can pick how many
03:35 - permissions we want it to have
03:37 - it can merely just read messages or it
03:39 - can send messages or it can add
03:41 - reactions or it can view email addresses
03:43 - and all kinds of different things like
03:45 - that so what we're going to do is go
03:46 - down here to add in oauth scope
03:49 - essentially the scopes are just the
03:50 - permissions that we have for our bot
03:52 - in whatever workspace we're in so here
03:55 - we can see there's a bunch of different
03:57 - scopes they have permissions for
03:58 - what they all do you obviously could add
04:00 - all of them if you wanted to but right
04:02 - now we only need one
04:03 - and we just need the chat and then right
04:06 - one so i need to find where that is
04:08 - uh chat chat chat come on where are you
04:11 - chat
04:12 - right is somewhere okay so i found it i
04:16 - just searched right here and then it
04:17 - popped up i have chat
04:18 - right okay so that's all we need this
04:20 - just allows us to send messages in a
04:22 - chat
04:22 - later on we will add other permissions
04:24 - and you'll see how we actually figure
04:26 - out which ones we need to add
04:27 - but for now that's all we need the next
04:29 - thing that we need to do is actually
04:31 - generate a
04:32 - token for our bot so to do that we first
04:34 - need to install this into our workspace
04:36 - and then i believe we can generate a
04:38 - token
04:38 - we're going to take that token copy that
04:40 - on our clipboard and then we'll add that
04:42 - to our actual python code which we'll
04:44 - start writing in a second so i'm going
04:45 - to say install
04:46 - app here we can say you know this is
04:49 - what it's allowed to do perform actions
04:51 - and channels and conversations
04:53 - we will allow that and there we go
04:56 - so now you can see we get a token for
04:58 - your workspace so i'm going to copy that
05:00 - token right here
05:02 - i will blur this out just so you guys
05:03 - don't see it and mess with my
05:05 - slack bot but just something to note
05:07 - here that if we add
05:08 - any more scopes we will need to
05:11 - reinstall this app into our workspace
05:13 - so if you mess with any of these scopes
05:15 - you're going to need to reinstall this
05:16 - i don't think the token will change when
05:18 - you do that
05:19 - but just keep in mind it will ask you to
05:21 - reinstall this in the workspace if you
05:23 - mess around with any
05:24 - of the scopes all right so now that we
05:26 - have that we're actually kind of good to
05:27 - go and we can head over to our python
05:29 - code
05:30 - so i'm in vs code right now this is the
05:31 - editor i'm going to use for this
05:33 - tutorial
05:33 - of course you guys can use whatever you
05:35 - want but i'm going to start by just
05:36 - making a new python file
05:38 - and calling this bot.pi you can call
05:40 - this whatever you want it does not need
05:42 - to be called bot.pi
05:43 - i'm also going to make another file here
05:45 - and i'm going to call this dot env
05:47 - now dot env is standing for our
05:49 - environment variable
05:51 - file so this is going to hold our token
05:53 - and a few other things that we'll need
05:55 - later on so that we can actually connect
05:57 - to our workspace and to our slack bot
06:00 - so the first thing i'm going to do in
06:01 - here is i'm going to say slack
06:02 - underscore token
06:03 - equals without a space and then i'm
06:05 - going to paste that token that i had
06:07 - from the slack api so go ahead and do
06:10 - that dot env
06:11 - so just period as the start you should
06:13 - see a little gear icon popping up if
06:15 - you're in vs code if you're not vs code
06:17 - that's totally fine
06:18 - just make sure these two files the
06:19 - python file and the env file are in the
06:22 - same directory
06:23 - then go ahead and save this file now
06:25 - what we're going to
06:26 - need to do next is install some python
06:28 - packages using
06:29 - pip so if you're not familiar with pip i
06:31 - actually don't know what it stands for i
06:33 - always call it
06:34 - uh package installer for python but i
06:36 - know that's not the correct name
06:37 - but anyways we need to go to our command
06:39 - prompt on our system
06:41 - if you are on mac in linux this is going
06:42 - to be a little bit different so i'll
06:44 - explain those steps in one second
06:45 - but start by just typing pip so p i p
06:49 - we type that and you should see some
06:51 - output popping up now this obviously
06:53 - assumes you have python installed on
06:55 - your system
06:55 - now for some reason pip is not working i
06:58 - have a video on my channel
06:59 - that explains how to install pygame so
07:02 - if you follow that what it will actually
07:03 - do is show you how to reconfigure your
07:05 - pip
07:06 - obviously when you get to the step where
07:07 - you're installing pi game rather than
07:09 - installing pi game install the module
07:11 - i'm about to show you here
07:12 - so if pip is working for you then what
07:14 - you're going to do if you're on windows
07:16 - in your command prompt is do pip install
07:18 - spell install correctly
07:20 - and then slack and spell slack correctly
07:23 - client this is what we're going to need
07:25 - to use to actually connect to our slack
07:27 - client
07:28 - so we'll just pip install slack clients
07:30 - now oops let me go back to command
07:32 - prompt here
07:33 - the next thing that we're going to need
07:34 - to do is install python hyphen
07:37 - dot env now what this is going to do is
07:39 - allow us to read from this environment
07:41 - variable file
07:42 - i just always like to use this module it
07:44 - makes things a lot easier so pip
07:46 - install python hyphen dot env make sure
07:49 - you
07:49 - add the python hyphen before all right
07:52 - so we're going to install that
07:53 - you can see that we're already satisfied
07:54 - for me but you guys should see some kind
07:56 - of loading bars
07:57 - and everything should be working now if
07:58 - you're on linux or you're on mac
08:00 - this will be the exact same steps except
08:02 - you're going to go to terminal
08:04 - and instead of pip you're going to type
08:05 - pip 3. so pip 3 should be the only
08:07 - difference here
08:08 - and if that doesn't work for you again i
08:10 - have another video that shows you how to
08:11 - reconfigure pip on mac so that works so
08:14 - i will leave that in the description as
08:15 - well
08:15 - and maybe put a card somewhere on the
08:17 - screen all right now that we have that
08:19 - what we're going to do is go inside of
08:21 - our bot.pi file
08:22 - and start writing some code so the first
08:24 - thing i'm going to do is i'm going to
08:25 - import
08:26 - slack next i'm going to import os which
08:28 - stands for operating system i believe
08:30 - and then we're going to import something
08:32 - from pathflip
08:34 - now pathlib is built into python 3 by
08:36 - default
08:37 - i will note right now that you need to
08:38 - use python 3.6 or above so you should
08:41 - already be using that version but you do
08:43 - need that
08:43 - so actually i'm going to say not import
08:45 - pathway but i'm going to say from
08:47 - pathlib
08:48 - import and then with a capital p path
08:51 - and then i'm going to say
08:52 - from oops if i can
08:55 - type correctly here from dot env import
08:59 - load underscore dot env what this is
09:02 - going to do is simply load our
09:03 - environment variable file so the first
09:05 - thing i'm going to do is say env
09:07 - underscore path which stands for our
09:09 - environment variable file path
09:11 - is equal to path and then i'm going to
09:14 - put a dot inside of a string here
09:16 - this stands for current directory then
09:18 - i'm going to add a slash
09:19 - and i'm going to do env with a period
09:22 - before it
09:23 - so this is just denoting where the path
09:25 - for our file is so that we can load it
09:28 - next we're going to say load.env and
09:30 - then we're going to say
09:31 - dot env underscore path equals env
09:34 - underscore path
09:35 - again just loading this environment
09:36 - variable file which will load the
09:38 - environment variable that we had inside
09:40 - of there
09:41 - next what we're going to do is we're
09:42 - going to say rtm client which is just
09:44 - the client that we're
09:45 - sorry not rtm client what am i saying
09:47 - this should be client
09:49 - is equal to slack dot web
09:52 - clients web client is what we're going
09:54 - to use for this tutorial
09:55 - there is some other clients built into
09:57 - slack here
09:58 - i'm not really going to talk about them
10:00 - it's just part of the slack api in this
10:02 - specific module
10:03 - in our case we're going to use the web
10:04 - client so we're going to say
10:06 - client equals slack dot web client and
10:08 - then we're going to say token
10:10 - equals os dot environ or however you say
10:14 - that
10:14 - and then inside of square brackets we're
10:16 - going to put the name of the environment
10:17 - variable that we had here
10:19 - so in this case i put slack token so i'm
10:22 - going to go ahead and put slack token
10:23 - inside of here
10:24 - and what this should do is load the
10:26 - actual value from this file
10:28 - and then kind of pass that in as our
10:30 - token so that is how we're going to
10:32 - store the token the reason i'm not just
10:34 - storing it in plain text here
10:36 - is because it's better practice to load
10:38 - this as an environment variable
10:39 - and say you had this on a github
10:41 - repository or something you would simply
10:43 - upload all of the code and you just
10:44 - wouldn't upload this environment
10:46 - variable file
10:47 - so that way no one knows what your token
10:49 - is so hopefully that makes sense
10:50 - all right so now we have client this
10:52 - should actually be working
10:54 - what we're going to do is go ahead and
10:55 - run this and see if this works
10:58 - all right so i got an annoying error
11:00 - here that's saying no module named slack
11:02 - now it's actually good that i ran into
11:03 - this because i wanted to cover this for
11:05 - you guys
11:06 - what happens here is that slack recently
11:09 - like the their api for it or the python
11:11 - package has been changed a bunch
11:13 - so if this doesn't work for you for some
11:15 - reason what you're going to need to do
11:16 - is simply
11:17 - uninstall slack so pip uninstall slack
11:20 - clients like that and then just simply
11:23 - reinstall it afterwards so in this case
11:24 - i'm going to say yes we will remove all
11:26 - of that
11:26 - and then i'm going to say pip install
11:29 - slack clients like that
11:31 - and hopefully this should reinstall and
11:32 - everything should be working fine
11:34 - so that uninstall and reinstall actually
11:35 - works for me you can see i'm not getting
11:37 - that red squiggly line anymore
11:39 - and now slack should actually import
11:40 - properly so let me go ahead and run this
11:42 - and we can see that that actually worked
11:44 - there was no error which means that this
11:46 - is perfectly fine
11:47 - so the next thing that i will do is i
11:49 - will set this up so we actually send a
11:51 - message into the slack client
11:53 - but just or sorry slack workspace what
11:55 - am i saying but if you run this
11:56 - and no errors happen at all you're good
11:58 - you will see an error if your token is
12:01 - incorrect or if you can't
12:02 - connect to your slack web client
12:06 - so next what i'm going to do is i'm
12:07 - going to say client dot and this should
12:09 - be chat and then dot
12:11 - underscore post message and this is
12:13 - simply the method to actually post the
12:15 - message to the chat
12:16 - now the first thing that we need to pass
12:18 - in here is the channel that we want to
12:20 - post to
12:21 - so we're going to say channel equals and
12:23 - then we're going to do the pound sign
12:24 - for the name of the channel
12:25 - and then test or whatever other channel
12:27 - we have so in this case let's actually
12:29 - go
12:30 - back to our slack workspace
12:33 - and rather than just having this general
12:35 - channel here what i'm going to do is
12:36 - make a new channel so i'll create a new
12:38 - channel
12:38 - i'm just going to call this one test
12:40 - like that i will press
12:42 - create i don't need to add anyone into
12:44 - this right now
12:45 - but what i will do is connect an app so
12:47 - notice this is add people and connect an
12:49 - app
12:50 - so i have to add my youtube bot into
12:52 - this channel otherwise i'm gonna get an
12:54 - error so let's say connect an app
12:56 - and then we should see that we have
12:57 - youtube bot i will go ahead and i will
12:59 - add
13:00 - that in all right so now we have the
13:02 - youtube bot
13:03 - inside of this channel and we should be
13:05 - good to connect to it and send a message
13:07 - into it so i will leave this
13:09 - open i guess we'll go back to that in a
13:10 - second but we'll say channel equals test
13:12 - the name of the channel we just created
13:14 - and then text is going to be equal to
13:16 - whatever we want to send so in this case
13:17 - let's just say
13:18 - you know hello world exclamation point
13:22 - now what i can do is simply run this and
13:24 - we should see that we don't get any
13:26 - errors that's great and if i go back to
13:28 - my slack
13:29 - channel here we have our youtube bot
13:31 - saying hello
13:32 - world now let me just show you quickly
13:34 - what happens if i try to send something
13:36 - in the general channel
13:37 - when our bot is not added to that
13:39 - channel so let's say general
13:40 - like that and let's run this and notice
13:43 - that we get all kinds of text giving us
13:45 - an error
13:46 - if we look right here it says the server
13:48 - responded with okay
13:49 - false which means no this was not good
13:52 - error not
13:53 - in channel so it's telling us the bot is
13:54 - not inside of the channel so if you run
13:56 - into any errors
13:57 - just look at this last line here and see
13:59 - if you can kind of understand what was
14:00 - sent
14:01 - but that is pretty much all i wanted to
14:02 - show you for this video so i'll go back
14:04 - to test run this one more time
14:06 - to make sure that i haven't messed
14:08 - anything up and we can get we get hello
14:10 - world popping up one more time
14:12 - so obviously in the next few videos
14:13 - we're going to be doing a lot more
14:14 - advanced stuff
14:15 - this was just the basic setup i wanted
14:17 - to show you guys how we can configure
14:18 - everything
14:19 - and hopefully that's working for all of
14:21 - you so with that being said if you
14:22 - enjoyed make sure you leave a like
14:24 - subscribe to the channel and leave a
14:25 - comment letting me know what you want to
14:26 - see for the rest of this tutorial series
