03:57 - idea of what a university house is like
03:59 - I will say that this house is definitely
04:01 - much bigger than most other university
04:04 - houses most places don't have two
04:05 - storeys and on the whole house we do
04:07 - have a unit above us so there is I think
04:09 - for guys that live up there and then
04:11 - yeah the rest of us just live there's
04:13 - two bedrooms up here for in the basement
04:15 - one washroom upstairs and then two
04:17 - downstairs but overall it's a pretty
04:19 - good place I mean I enjoy living here
