00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back so in
00:02 - this video we're gonna be talking about
00:03 - the switch statement the way I'm gonna
00:05 - teach you guys the switch statement is
00:07 - essentially comparing what we've written
00:08 - in the previous video which is this kind
00:10 - of function that essentially uses some
00:12 - if some else ifs and some else's or at
00:14 - least if did in the previous video to
00:16 - perform the example of allowing us to
00:17 - type in some color and changing the text
00:20 - of you know I don't know say some
00:22 - element on the screen to be back color
00:24 - so what we're gonna do is do this now
00:25 - with a switch statement so you guys can
00:27 - see a little bit of the difference on
00:28 - how it works and hopefully understand it
00:30 - a bit better so what I'm gonna do is
00:31 - scrap all this code where essentially we
00:33 - had three if statements I'm going to
00:34 - switch this to a switch now the way that
00:38 - a switch statement works is you start by
00:39 - typing the word switch you put brackets
00:42 - inside the brackets you put an
00:44 - expression or a variable that you're
00:46 - gonna be checking so in this case text
00:48 - is what we're gonna check right we're
00:50 - gonna see if it's equal to different
00:51 - values so we're gonna put that variable
00:53 - here next we're gonna put our curly
00:56 - braces like this we're gonna type the
00:58 - word case space :
01:01 - then we're gonna tab indent and hit
01:04 - break and put a semicolon now I know
01:06 - this is like some of you guys like whoa
01:08 - what is all this what's happening I'm
01:11 - gonna go through it but just bear with
01:13 - me for a second here so case what does
01:15 - this mean
01:16 - essentially inside of a switch statement
01:18 - we have cases now the cases are kind of
01:21 - all of the different things that could
01:22 - happen that the different branches are
01:24 - different routes we could go on so in
01:26 - this instance we have text and our first
01:29 - case is going to be if text is equal to
01:31 - read now this is case one and what this
01:35 - is saying is essentially case read which
01:37 - means text is equal to read so if text
01:40 - is equal to read we're gonna do whatever
01:42 - is after this : and before this break
01:45 - statement so in this case we can change
01:47 - the document so actually we'll just
01:49 - steal what we have here and I'll change
01:50 - this a bit so document dot get element
01:53 - by ID dot style
01:55 - Dodd's color equals red like that and
02:00 - want to change this to header so what
02:03 - this is going to do now is the centrist
02:05 - say okay the switch our first case is if
02:07 - it's red if it's red we'll change the
02:09 - document to be or to change the element
02:11 - to be the color red
02:12 - then we can bring and that's what this
02:14 - case does so let's actually refresh to
02:15 - see if this works
02:16 - so by type red you can see that it
02:19 - changes to red and you know if I type
02:21 - something else if I type blue obviously
02:23 - we see nothing else is happening all
02:26 - right so what's the next thing that we
02:27 - need to do well we need to create some
02:28 - more cases so what's another case that
02:31 - could happen here well we could have a
02:33 - case that our text is blue right that's
02:36 - what equals state so we'll break we'll
02:39 - copy this and then what we'll do is
02:41 - we'll simply put in here and we'll
02:43 - change the color to be blue and I think
02:46 - you guys are kind of getting the hang of
02:47 - how this works essentially the switch
02:49 - statement will check these different
02:51 - cases it will check them in order if you
02:53 - know this text is equal to one of these
02:56 - cases then the case will run and then
02:58 - we'll break out of the switch statement
02:59 - and we won't bother looking at any of
03:01 - the other cases that are there now
03:02 - there's some more to talk about but
03:04 - let's try this for now so here we have
03:05 - red we have blue so let's try blue we
03:08 - can see that changes to blue let's try
03:09 - red we can see that changes to red
03:11 - awesome so let's add one more case and I
03:14 - guess we will do green as our last case
03:17 - to stay consistent with our previous
03:18 - example so we have green like that
03:21 - change our color to green and one last
03:25 - test here to make sure everything's
03:27 - working let's go green and it changes to
03:30 - green awesome
03:31 - now what I'm going to show you guys is
03:33 - called default now what is default well
03:36 - default is kind of like the else inside
03:38 - of a switch statement so here what we
03:41 - can actually do is create what's called
03:42 - a default case which essentially means
03:44 - that if none of the cases above this ran
03:47 - then will always default and do this
03:49 - default now what the default is gonna be
03:52 - is just changing our text color to be
03:54 - black because that is what we need it to
03:56 - be so we'll change it to be black and
03:59 - there we go what we've essentially done
04:01 - is simulated you know an if else if and
04:04 - else using a switch statement now these
04:06 - are useful sometimes because it's a lot
04:07 - easier to actually read your code when
04:09 - you put it in a switch statement rather
04:10 - than having them all in that branching
04:13 - if and else statements but in some
04:15 - instances you know you need to use the
04:17 - if else if you're not going to just be
04:18 - checking one variable whenever you do a
04:21 - condition but for us since all we're
04:23 - doing is checking one variable this
04:25 - variable can be equal
04:26 - to a few different things so we'll check
04:28 - if it's equal to these different things
04:29 - in these cases and then do whatever is
04:32 - after this so anyways let's have a look
04:34 - at this now let's refresh this let's
04:37 - type hello we can see the text isn't
04:39 - changed let's go green oops if I could
04:42 - get in here green it changes to green if
04:45 - I type nothing and I click click it'll
04:47 - go back to black so that is how the
04:49 - switch statement works and that is you
04:51 - know a good example of when we would use
04:53 - a switch data now what I'm going to show
04:55 - you next because we actually have quite
04:56 - a bit of time left in this video is a
04:59 - different example of one maybe you
05:01 - wouldn't you would not want to use a
05:02 - switch statement and that's what I'm
05:04 - gonna use an if-else statement for but
05:06 - let's just do an example here so I'm
05:07 - gonna delete all of this and what I'm
05:09 - actually gonna do is change this text
05:11 - input example to be rather than changing
05:14 - the color of this header tag I'm gonna
05:15 - ask the user to type in their name and
05:17 - essentially if they type in or sorry not
05:20 - their name their age and if their age is
05:22 - greater than a certain number I'm gonna
05:23 - tell them that you know they're an adult
05:25 - or they're not an adult it's a good
05:26 - example that I like to use so in this
05:28 - case I'll say what is your age just a
05:31 - little header before our input box they
05:32 - can type it in here when they click
05:34 - clicked we'll run this press function
05:36 - and we can see what their ages so what
05:38 - I'm gonna actually do is make another
05:40 - text input here so I'm just gonna say P
05:42 - slash P I'm just gonna say ID equals
05:46 - output and what I'm gonna do is say var
05:51 - hmm actually do I want to do this yeah
05:53 - sure let's save our output equals
05:56 - document dot get element by ID and here
06:01 - I'm gonna call this output and what this
06:04 - is gonna allow me to do is actually
06:05 - change the output tag here by just
06:08 - referencing the variable output rather
06:10 - than typing this entire thing whatever I
06:11 - want to change it so what I'm gonna do
06:13 - now is we're gonna put an if statement
06:14 - and remember that this function is gonna
06:16 - run whenever this user clicks the click
06:19 - button so in this instance we're gonna
06:20 - grab the text which should hopefully be
06:22 - the user's what-do-you-call-it
06:24 - age and what I'm gonna do is try to
06:26 - convert that age into a number so that I
06:28 - can compare it against another number
06:30 - now you'll see how that works so what
06:32 - I'm gonna do in here is I'm actually
06:33 - gonna try to convert whatever it is the
06:36 - user types in into a number
06:37 - and the reason I need to do that is
06:39 - because whenever the user types
06:40 - something in a text input box like a
06:42 - text field it's assumed that the data
06:45 - type that comes in is a string so we
06:47 - know what a string looks like and the
06:48 - strings have those quotation marks and
06:50 - we remember from previously and actually
06:52 - I'll do it down here if I compare
06:54 - something with quotation marks to
06:55 - something say like that so 42 like that
06:58 - and I use my three equal signs we're
07:01 - gonna get the false value for that right
07:03 - and I'd like to be able to use the
07:05 - greater than sign of the less than sign
07:06 - between these different values so I can
07:08 - compare whatever the user types in to
07:10 - whatever number I'm gonna compare to so
07:12 - in this case 18 to see if they're an
07:13 - adult so to do that I need to convert
07:15 - this to a number so to do that I'm
07:17 - actually going to use a function called
07:18 - parse int what this is gonna do is
07:21 - simply take the integer value of
07:24 - whatever string we typed in and just
07:26 - return that to us just give that to us
07:28 - so this will save our text equals the
07:30 - number of whatever string we typed in
07:33 - and this will convert that to a number
07:34 - okay so what I'm going to do is compare
07:36 - the text to some number in this case I'm
07:39 - going to say 18
07:40 - so if text is greater than or equal to
07:43 - 18 so if their age is greater than or
07:45 - equal to 18 what I'm gonna do is change
07:47 - this output text to say you are an adult
07:49 - so to do that I'm gonna say output which
07:52 - is the variable here that's holding a
07:54 - reference did this ptex with this
07:56 - paragraph tag let me say dot innerhtml
08:00 - equals and in this case you are older
08:03 - than 18 exclamation point next what I'm
08:08 - gonna do is to essentially say this is
08:10 - not true we'll change this output text
08:12 - to say you are not older than 18 and
08:16 - let's run this and see if this works so
08:18 - refresh what is your age let's say 18
08:20 - click you are older than 18 what if I
08:23 - say 17 you get you are not older than 18
08:27 - now notice that this one is kind of
08:29 - misleading it says you were older than
08:30 - 18 but you could actually be 18 so what
08:32 - we should do is change this so that we
08:35 - have one that says if you're 18 right so
08:37 - let's say else if text equals equals 18
08:42 - then what we'll do is and I gotta get
08:45 - rid of that actually and add one here it
08:50 - is will
08:50 - simply add this output text and will say
08:52 - you are 8ki like that then we can change
08:57 - this to say greater than 18 and now what
08:59 - we're gonna do is check if it's greater
09:00 - than 18 if they are we'll say you're
09:01 - older otherwise if they are 18 we'll say
09:03 - you're 18 and then finally else you're
09:05 - not folder than 18 so let's run this
09:07 - refresh
09:09 - let's go 17 you're not older than 18
09:11 - let's go 18 you are 18 and then 19 you
09:15 - are older than 18 and that is how you
09:18 - use this now the reason you wouldn't use
09:19 - a switch statement for this is because
09:21 - we're tracking any values that are
09:23 - greater than 18 we're gonna print out
09:26 - and say well you're older than 18 but if
09:28 - we use a switch statement we need to
09:29 - check if it's exactly that value right
09:32 - we need to have you know the text up top
09:34 - and then we need to check 18 19 20 21 it
09:36 - doesn't make sense to use a switch
09:38 - statement in that instance whereas
09:39 - before when we were just typing you know
09:40 - red green blue that's totally fine and
09:43 - it makes sense to use a switch statement
09:44 - but here since we're checking values we
09:46 - need to use if-else if-else so anyways
09:48 - that has been switch statements and as
09:50 - well as a count a little bit of a more
09:52 - advanced example with if Elif and else
09:55 - if you guys are looking to challenge
09:56 - yourself I will mention to you that you
09:58 - can actually put if statements and hold
10:00 - chaining blocks inside of other if
10:03 - statements and other chaining blocks so
10:05 - you can kind of go and nest a bunch of
10:07 - statements together so you guys can try
10:09 - to do something like that
10:10 - and you know that's good practice
10:12 - actually if you want to create something
10:13 - I could choose your own adventure game
10:14 - you can use what I've just showed you to
10:16 - actually do something similar to that so
10:18 - anyways that has been it for this video
10:19 - if you guys enjoyed make sure to leave a
10:21 - like and subscribe to the channel and I
10:22 - will see you guys in another video
