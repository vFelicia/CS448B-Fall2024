00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back so
00:01 - today I'm making a very highly requested
00:03 - video on Linux I'm gonna be discussing
00:06 - the pros and cons of Linux and why I use
00:09 - it on my laptop as my main operating
00:11 - system and then in a dual boot
00:12 - environment unlike PC now personally I'm
00:15 - non-expert at Linux I've been using it
00:17 - for about four months I have it on my
00:19 - laptop and then obviously here in dual
00:21 - boot and that's about my experience with
00:23 - Linux I am you know non expert I'm using
00:25 - a bun to with the genome desktop just
00:27 - you know the built-in standard stuff and
00:29 - I feel like that's where a lot of you
00:30 - guys are as well you have some basic
00:33 - understanding of Linux you could switch
00:34 - to it and you could use it but there's
00:36 - something holding you back or you're not
00:38 - sure whether or not you should make the
00:40 - change and go all Linux now personally I
00:42 - have every operating system so I have a
00:44 - good idea and good reference point to be
00:46 - able to compare these different things
00:47 - but anyways let's get into this video
00:49 - discuss the pros and cons of Linux and
00:51 - why or why I wouldn't recommend
00:53 - switching to that operating system now
00:55 - before we get too far into the video I
00:56 - need to show you guys these awesome
00:58 - wallets so this is a wallet I got sent
01:00 - from expert wallets I think there's a
01:02 - link in the description to the website
01:04 - where you can have a look at it but it's
01:05 - an awesome card holder wallet so you can
01:07 - see when I press the button down here it
01:09 - actually ejects the cards I believe it
01:11 - can hold five up top like this and then
01:13 - there's some flaps in here for some more
01:15 - cards and some cash and another flap at
01:18 - the back that could hold another card
01:19 - now these actually come with an optional
01:21 - GPS tracker as well but definitely check
01:24 - them out there's a link in the
01:25 - description and again a thank you for
01:26 - sending these over for free alright so
01:28 - let's get started with the pros now the
01:30 - first and most important thing with
01:32 - Linux the reason that I use on my laptop
01:34 - as the main operating and the only
01:36 - operating system on there is because of
01:38 - the consistency and the reliability now
01:42 - I'm comparing this to an operating
01:43 - system like Windows whereas many times
01:46 - on my Windows laptop before it had a bun
01:48 - to on it when I opened it up I would
01:50 - just want to throw it against the wall
01:52 - because I'd see that dreaded screen
01:54 - where it said it was updating this is
01:56 - something that I absolutely cannot deal
01:58 - with I do not want to open up my
01:59 - computer and not be able to use it for
02:01 - half an hour because it has to do an
02:02 - update that I didn't agree to and I
02:04 - absolutely don't want to be rushing for
02:06 - a power source in the middle of the
02:08 - night when I open my laptop because it
02:09 - says updating don't power off and god
02:12 - only knows what's gonna happen
02:13 - this shuts off when it's in the middle
02:15 - of updating with Linux this does not
02:17 - happen you can choose when you want to
02:18 - update how you want to update and you
02:20 - don't ever have to update at all now I
02:22 - know in Windows you can go and tweak
02:24 - these settings but I feel like it
02:25 - doesn't matter what you do on that
02:27 - operating system it will somehow find a
02:29 - way to ruin your day someday in the
02:31 - future when it needs to update and it's
02:33 - done that for me so many times and
02:35 - that's one of the main reasons I love a
02:36 - bun too because I know that's not gonna
02:38 - happen and I know that if I need to open
02:40 - my computer and get something done I'm
02:42 - not gonna have to worry and that's gonna
02:44 - be fine the next thing that I love about
02:45 - a bun - and Linux in particular is
02:48 - security
02:49 - now I believe with every Linux
02:51 - distribution at least with a bun - for
02:53 - sure I've tested that on my main
02:54 - computer and my laptop when you install
02:57 - this operating system it gives you the
02:59 - option to encrypt yup yeah encrypt your
03:02 - disk drive now essentially what that
03:03 - means is if someone gets access to your
03:05 - drive even if they plug it into a
03:08 - different computer and try to run you
03:09 - know a different operating system on
03:10 - something like that they won't be able
03:12 - to without knowing your master
03:14 - encryption key now essentially what that
03:16 - is is some key that actually unlocks the
03:19 - drive to make it readable so this means
03:21 - that if I plug in my a bun to hard drive
03:23 - into a new computer
03:25 - I can't immediately read it and start
03:27 - looking at all the stuff on it without
03:28 - having that key so that's actually huge
03:31 - if you're someone that's into cyber
03:32 - security and you're someone that cares
03:34 - about the physical you know safety of
03:36 - your devices because what a lot of
03:37 - people don't know is if I have access to
03:39 - your computer especially this one right
03:41 - here and you have just a standard
03:43 - Windows drive on that if I take that out
03:45 - and I just plug that into a new SATA
03:47 - slot on my computer and I login I can
03:50 - actually read your entire Drive if it's
03:52 - not encrypted so that's a big deal
03:54 - there's also a lot of other security
03:55 - features built into the operating system
03:57 - that do with network security and a lot
03:59 - of other important things and when it
04:00 - comes to security a bun - is kind of
04:02 - just the winner it's obviously not a
04:04 - hundred percent there's things that you
04:05 - can do to hack in and to get in but
04:08 - compared to an operating system like
04:09 - Windows or like Mac it's much much more
04:12 - secure and just makes you feel a lot
04:14 - safer when you're actually using it now
04:15 - the next massive advantage of Linux is
04:18 - performance now this is particularly
04:20 - important if you're running on hardware
04:21 - that's outdated or just slower hardware
04:24 - in general Linux is a much faster
04:26 - more efficient and lighter weight
04:28 - operating system for almost every single
04:30 - distribution that you have now even with
04:32 - my distribution which is a bun - which
04:34 - has the full genome genome desktop which
04:37 - would be one of the heavier weight
04:38 - versions of Linux it runs extremely fast
04:41 - on my laptop which is like a mid-level
04:43 - laptop that would take typically let's
04:45 - say 45 seconds to boot up in Windows now
04:48 - with a bun - on it it loads in probably
04:51 - 10 to 15 seconds and everything just
04:53 - happens much faster even programming and
04:56 - I know this sounds kind of ridiculous
04:57 - when I'm running some specific
04:59 - programming scripts I notice things
05:01 - happen faster in a bun - and in Linux
05:04 - when I'm trying to open a program when
05:05 - I'm trying to navigate some or even just
05:07 - look things up on the web
05:09 - sometimes it runs faster in Linux the
05:12 - kind of rule of thumb is that Linux is
05:13 - just faster and more efficient and
05:15 - specifically when you're working with
05:16 - outdated hardware or hardware that can't
05:19 - isn't really capable of running a full
05:20 - Windows install like efficiently Linux
05:24 - is a much better choice so Windows I'm
05:26 - sure you guys you guys know running on
05:28 - an old computer just doesn't work very
05:30 - well it's super slow it takes you know
05:32 - three four minutes to even get into the
05:34 - screen where you can see the windows
05:35 - loading happening with a bun - that just
05:38 - doesn't happen it's so much faster and
05:40 - Linux is just way better when it comes
05:41 - to performance now the next pro is going
05:43 - to be specific to programmers and this
05:45 - is just programming on Linux there's
05:48 - nothing really specific I can say about
05:49 - this other than it's just way nicer way
05:52 - easier and generally faster to get
05:54 - things done when you're working in Linux
05:55 - when it comes to installing complicated
05:57 - modules and packages a lot of the times
06:00 - when you need to do that on Windows they
06:01 - involve multiple steps there's graphical
06:03 - installers you go to install you got to
06:05 - extract this you got to go here install
06:07 - this here move that there it's just
06:09 - usually way easier on Linux now I'm sure
06:11 - there's some exceptions here when it
06:13 - comes to specific programming languages
06:15 - and whatnot but in general and with all
06:17 - of the different programming languages
06:18 - that I've used so far they've all worked
06:20 - better and just been easier and less
06:22 - stressful to use on Linux and I now
06:25 - pretty much do all my programming which
06:27 - is pretty heavy programming - quite a
06:29 - bit of it on Linux because it's just way
06:31 - easier the terminal is so much nicer for
06:33 - running different commands just moving
06:35 - and navigating around things using the
06:37 - terminal commands are way easier on
06:39 - and it just it's just way less of a
06:41 - headache so definitely if you're doing a
06:42 - lot of heavy programming I would
06:44 - recommend at least dual booting the
06:45 - Linux on your machine and using the you
06:48 - know using Linux for your programming
06:50 - and then Windows or Mac for whatever
06:51 - else you need to do so those have kind
06:56 - of been my four pros and the things I
06:58 - noticed immediately about Linux that I
07:00 - loved
07:01 - I'm sure there's obviously hundreds
07:02 - thousands of more pros and reasons why
07:04 - you would want to use it but for me
07:06 - those are the things that stood out and
07:07 - are the most important to me so that's
07:09 - why I mentioned them but now let's go
07:11 - ahead and get into the cons of Linux as
07:13 - there is actually quite a few of those
07:14 - as well alright so the first con of
07:17 - Linux and this might seem like it's
07:18 - gonna contradict one of the points I
07:20 - made earlier in the pros is that there's
07:22 - a lot of bugs and a lot of things that
07:24 - don't really work now this is just
07:27 - because Linux is an open-source
07:29 - operating system it's free does not have
07:32 - nearly the massive teams that Windows
07:34 - and Mac OS have working on them and
07:36 - because of that there is a lot of issues
07:39 - with the operating system now for me
07:40 - I've had this operating system crash a
07:43 - few times on me or at least crash
07:45 - specific applications that are
07:46 - third-party apps and when I initially
07:49 - installed this on my computer trying to
07:51 - get a lot of my accessories like my
07:53 - microphone and my what is it I guess
07:55 - speaker and even my keyboard to work on
07:58 - it properly was just a nightmare it took
08:00 - a really long time the dryers for those
08:02 - were not automatically installed
08:04 - whereas with Windows they are
08:06 - automatically installed and with Mac
08:07 - they typically are as well and I had to
08:09 - go through some pretty technical and
08:11 - difficult steps to actually get them
08:12 - working so that's something to consider
08:14 - a lot of accessories and a lot of the
08:16 - things that are built for computers just
08:18 - to plug in USB or whatever it is are not
08:20 - designed to work with Linux and are not
08:22 - designed to work with a bunch so trying
08:24 - to get them work get them working
08:26 - sometimes can be difficult and I've
08:27 - heard stories of specific accessories
08:29 - just completely not working at all with
08:31 - the computer so that was a big deal for
08:33 - me on my laptop I didn't have sound the
08:35 - entire first day that I had the laptop
08:37 - because I couldn't figure out how to get
08:39 - it to work I also didn't have Wi-Fi the
08:41 - Wi-Fi adapter was not initially
08:43 - installed on there so if that's your
08:45 - only computer or that's your only tech
08:46 - device how are you gonna look up how to
08:48 - solve that right so just some things
08:50 - like that there's a lot of bugs a lot of
08:52 - things that just
08:52 - wrong and sometimes you're gonna run
08:54 - into some pretty difficult technical
08:56 - issues with your accessories and even
08:58 - with software which is my next point so
09:00 - there's a lot of software that you
09:02 - probably want to use that you can't use
09:04 - on Linux that's just because it's not
09:06 - supported you know this operating system
09:08 - is not meant for you know your average
09:10 - everyday user the person who just wants
09:13 - to go on their computer and write in
09:14 - Microsoft Word and use Excel guess what
09:16 - you can't get that on Linux or if you
09:18 - can I don't know how and I haven't done
09:21 - so and the built-in tools that come with
09:23 - Linux which are supposed to kind of
09:24 - substitute those they have like Lib ray
09:26 - office writer & Liber a spreadsheet or
09:29 - something like that
09:30 - in my opinion are really not comparable
09:32 - to the kind of Microsoft products
09:34 - I'm sure obviously you can use Google
09:36 - Docs you can use google word art Google
09:38 - word what is it Google sheets all of
09:39 - that but still it's just something Negin
09:41 - sitter that there's a lot of software
09:43 - and specifically video editing software
09:44 - as well that you can't use on this
09:46 - operating system and that just don't
09:47 - work well and that's kind of the two
09:49 - major cons that I noticed with this
09:51 - operating system is that a lot of what I
09:53 - wanted to do I couldn't actually do on
09:55 - this earth if I could it was just a pain
09:57 - and it wasn't nearly as clean as it was
09:59 - on Windows and that's why I keep dual
10:01 - boot on this machine now other than that
10:04 - there's nothing too drastic that I would
10:07 - say about a bun to that I don't like I
10:09 - will say that there is some actually
10:10 - screen resolution error so I have two
10:12 - monitors here and trying to get these
10:14 - monitors to be different resolutions so
10:16 - that they don't look sumed on one and
10:18 - zoomed on the other because I have a 4k
10:19 - monitor and a 1080p monitor is it
10:23 - doesn't work there's no way I've looked
10:24 - it up I can't even get it to work
10:26 - properly after going through all these
10:27 - guides to get this one to go 1080p and
10:30 - to get this one to go 4k and to have no
10:32 - scaling issues whatsoever what I want to
10:34 - do is just zoom one screen and unzoom
10:36 - the other one and I can't do that and
10:38 - there's a lot of things like that where
10:40 - it's just these different accessories
10:41 - and compatibility things that just don't
10:43 - work on the system and there's nothing
10:45 - you can really do to fix that now
10:47 - obviously there's tons of customized
10:49 - abilities I'm sure there's probably
10:50 - something I've done wrong but that's
10:52 - just something to notice here right you
10:53 - know there's some things you want to do
10:55 - that you can't do and even if you can do
10:57 - them they're pretty difficult to get
10:58 - done and if you're just an average user
11:00 - that doesn't understand all these
11:02 - technical pseudo commands and
11:04 - lingo and jargon and all of that it's
11:06 - going to be very difficult to figure out
11:07 - how to do it it's another thing there is
11:09 - absolutely no support for this operating
11:11 - system when it comes to like calling in
11:13 - and asking someone for help or having
11:15 - someone even come to your house you know
11:17 - and fix it whereas something like Mac is
11:19 - something like Windows you can bring
11:20 - that to the store and someone will fix
11:22 - that for you now that's because this is
11:24 - an open source and free operating system
11:26 - one of the advantages of it also becomes
11:28 - a massive disadvantage as well so
11:30 - anyways that has kind of been my opinion
11:32 - on Ubuntu now I understand a lot of this
11:35 - is subjective it's for my use case and
11:37 - that's what I tried to make clear at the
11:38 - beginning of this video there's anything
11:40 - in here that you guys disagree with or
11:41 - that you'd like to elaborate on please
11:43 - do leave a comment down below and a last
11:46 - and final plug before we leave go and
11:48 - follow me on Instagram go and follow me
11:49 - on Twitter and with that being said I
11:51 - hope you guys enjoyed the video if you
11:52 - did leave a like subscribe and I will
11:54 - see you in
