00:00 - now this is something I think a lot of
00:01 - people Overlook but this can be a
00:03 - massive skill and Advantage if you build
00:05 - really strong and good habits early on
00:08 - when you're learning to code everyone
00:10 - has habits right like we operate on our
00:12 - habits and the people that are most
00:13 - successful in a lot of areas are really
00:15 - just the people who have built the best
00:17 - habits right that's the same here with
00:19 - programming and with building strong
00:21 - programming habits so to give you a few
00:23 - examples here a habit uh that I've
00:25 - recently kind of started picking up on
00:27 - in programming is giving really good
00:29 - variable names and always making sure
00:32 - I'm having a consistent styling when I'm
00:34 - writing code another habit could be like
00:36 - do you always write a test before you
00:37 - write your code are you always testing
00:39 - your code are you making a commit after
00:41 - every small feature are you separating
00:43 - logic out into different kind of
00:45 - functional units so I would challenge
00:46 - you guys think about what are your
00:48 - programming habits what do you always do
00:51 - good or bad and should you continue that
00:53 - or should you try to change that habit
00:54 - in kind of a more positive direction
