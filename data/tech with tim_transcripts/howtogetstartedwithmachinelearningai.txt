00:00 - hello everyone and welcome back so in
00:02 - this video what I'm gonna be doing is
00:03 - telling you guys how to get started with
00:05 - machine learning so I see these
00:06 - questions all the time from usually
00:08 - beginner or intermediate programmers
00:10 - asking me where they should start and
00:12 - what they should do to get into machine
00:13 - learning and artificial intelligence so
00:16 - in this video what I'm gonna be doing is
00:17 - telling you first of all what language
00:18 - you should be using slash learning what
00:21 - kind of Mac background you need to do
00:22 - this and then what process you should be
00:25 - following in terms of what should you
00:26 - learn first and where should you kind of
00:27 - move from there to get better and better
00:29 - with machine learning at a beginner
00:31 - level so with that being said let's go
00:33 - ahead and get into the video and talk
00:34 - about how to get started with machine
00:35 - learning before we get started I need to
00:37 - talk about the sponsor of today's video
00:38 - which is kite now kite is a free plug-in
00:41 - for your IDE or text editor uses machine
00:43 - learning to give you the best possible
00:45 - completions for your Python code it's
00:47 - capable of completing entire lines
00:48 - entire function calls and it ranks all
00:51 - of its completions by relevance so you
00:52 - get shown the best ones first even as
00:55 - another feature called intelligence
00:56 - snippets which allows you to quickly tab
00:58 - to the different options and choose
00:59 - which completion you'd like one of the
01:01 - coolest features that comes with kite is
01:03 - called co-pilot now what code pilot does
01:05 - this provide one-click documentation it
01:07 - shows you information about modules
01:09 - classes methods and functions based on
01:12 - your cursor location now the best part
01:14 - of kite is that it's free and you can
01:15 - download it at the link below alright so
01:18 - the first and probably the most
01:19 - important thing to talk about here is
01:20 - the language that you should be using
01:22 - for machine learning as a beginner just
01:25 - getting started
01:26 - now there's tons of languages that are
01:27 - designed specifically for machine
01:29 - learning like our than some other
01:30 - languages that I can't think of a top of
01:32 - my head and you can even do it in things
01:34 - like JavaScript and Java and all these
01:36 - other languages you can do machine
01:37 - learning and artificial intelligence in
01:39 - now the language I'm gonna recommend is
01:41 - Python now the reason I say this is
01:43 - because it's kind of the industry
01:44 - standard for machine learning and
01:46 - artificial intelligence and if you get a
01:48 - job in this field chances are you're
01:50 - probably gonna be using Python to do
01:52 - most of your work now it's great because
01:54 - you don't only use it for machine
01:56 - learning it's capable of doing many
01:57 - other things and it's probably one of
01:59 - the easier languages to pick up and
02:01 - start using as a beginner so that's why
02:03 - I recommend Python it also has the most
02:06 - kind of modules and support for machine
02:08 - learning and artificial intelligence and
02:10 - if you're looking for tutorials and
02:11 - trying to learn
02:12 - to do this you're gonna find the most
02:14 - support and resources in the Python
02:16 - language so I recommend starting with
02:18 - Python as you get more advanced you can
02:20 - move into more specific languages but
02:22 - python is a great one to get started
02:23 - with alright so the next thing to talk
02:25 - about is math now I know this scares a
02:27 - lot of people away because they always
02:29 - say you know I'm not very good at math
02:31 - can I get started with machine learning
02:32 - I know machine learning is a lot of math
02:34 - do I need to know the math to do it now
02:36 - the answer this question is no you do
02:38 - not need to be good at math to do
02:40 - machine learning but if you are it will
02:42 - help you tremendously now let me explain
02:45 - this you can go through and you can do
02:47 - any kind of machine learning tutorial
02:49 - you can even you know probably get a job
02:51 - without understanding how a lot of the
02:53 - math for machine learning works and you
02:55 - can use it fine and you can make
02:57 - predictions you can create applications
02:58 - you can do cool things but if you
03:00 - understand how the math works it makes
03:03 - everything so much easier and so much
03:05 - clearer is at the end of the day machine
03:07 - learning is not just this black box that
03:09 - you know something comes in something
03:11 - comes out it's a very complicated
03:13 - mathematical algorithm written by you
03:15 - know professors and math experts and all
03:17 - you do is use this map that's already
03:19 - been created for you to get the outcome
03:21 - that you want so if you can understand
03:22 - why this works and why things are
03:24 - happening the way they are you can be
03:25 - much better and you can have a much
03:27 - clearer understanding of all of these
03:28 - things all right so now that we've
03:30 - picked a language and we understand how
03:31 - much math we need to know for machine
03:33 - learning or maybe how much math we don't
03:35 - know for machine learning I'm just gonna
03:37 - kind of walk you through the steps of
03:39 - machine learning now the reason I'm
03:41 - doing this is because a lot of people
03:43 - that are getting into this don't
03:44 - understand what's actually involved in
03:46 - doing AI machine learning they see some
03:48 - cool video of some guy who made some
03:50 - awesome machine learning project did
03:52 - some cool artificial intelligence robot
03:53 - whatever it is and they want to get
03:55 - started but let me just walk you through
03:57 - what actually goes into doing this
03:59 - because you might realize quickly that
04:01 - maybe this isn't exactly what you want
04:02 - to do or it's a little bit different
04:04 - than you were thinking now the first
04:06 - step in any machine learning kind of
04:08 - project is analyzing the problem or what
04:11 - you want to do figuring out what is my
04:13 - machine learning model I'm gonna do for
04:15 - me isn't gonna predict something is it
04:17 - gonna create something is it gonna
04:18 - recommend information what is it gonna
04:20 - do understanding the problem is
04:21 - important and that's how you're going to
04:23 - pick what algorithm you're going to use
04:24 - now
04:25 - you do that it's time for data
04:27 - collection what data are we gonna use
04:30 - for this machine learning algorithm we
04:32 - know with machine learning artificial
04:34 - intelligence we need a ton of data ton
04:36 - like sometimes you could be using
04:38 - terabytes of data to train a model so
04:40 - what data do we need and where are we
04:42 - gonna get it from after we do that we
04:44 - have to clean the data and all of our
04:46 - data comes in nice and crisp like we
04:49 - might see in some data sets we need to
04:50 - clean this out we need to pick what we
04:52 - actually want and that brings us into
04:54 - the next step which is data selection we
04:56 - have tons of data but it's all of it
04:58 - relevant to our problem is all of it
05:00 - relevant to what we want to do answer is
05:02 - usually no so that involves now you know
05:05 - we collect the data we pick what we want
05:07 - and we have to pick the important things
05:08 - so we're actually going to use in our
05:10 - model now after we do that what do we do
05:12 - we have to pick what model we're gonna
05:14 - be using what algorithm we're gonna use
05:16 - how we're actually gonna solve this
05:18 - problem using machine learning or using
05:21 - artificial intelligence
05:22 - now after that we've picked what model
05:24 - we're going to use we need to train that
05:25 - model so feed all that data in and after
05:28 - that we need to validate the model we
05:29 - need to test its accuracy we need to see
05:31 - if this actually made sense and if it
05:33 - did something and then what we need to
05:34 - do is keep doing this again we need to
05:37 - keep tweaking the model and making it
05:39 - better and better and better until it
05:41 - can't get any better anymore so notice
05:43 - that in this the actual machine learning
05:46 - part of this like running the algorithm
05:47 - and training and testing the model is
05:49 - not a major part of this a major part of
05:52 - this is picking what algorithm we're
05:53 - gonna be using and picking the correct
05:55 - data and that's a massive part of
05:57 - machine learning and that's what's gonna
05:58 - bring me in to my next point here on
06:00 - where we need to get started with
06:01 - machine learning the first thing that I
06:03 - always say to people and the first kind
06:05 - of thing you need to do is make sure you
06:07 - understand the basics of the language
06:09 - that you're using and maybe even more
06:11 - than the basics kind of like the
06:13 - intermediate concepts involved with that
06:15 - language like objects and classes and
06:17 - all of that so for this video I've
06:19 - recommended Python for machine learning
06:21 - so if you're gonna use that make sure
06:23 - you know how Python works you know the
06:25 - syntax and you know all of that because
06:27 - these beginning steps involve
06:29 - understanding Python to pick out your
06:31 - data to clean it to select it to do
06:34 - everything you need to do because data
06:36 - is the most important part of our
06:37 - machine
06:38 - applications usually other than the
06:40 - model now once you've done that we've
06:42 - understood the basics and you feel
06:44 - confident in the language it's time
06:46 - actually move into machine learning now
06:48 - there's so many different areas of
06:50 - machine learning and artificial
06:51 - intelligence so I'm gonna just specify
06:54 - where I recommend beginners kind of
06:56 - start because there's so many places you
06:58 - could go now I always say to learn the
07:01 - basic algorithms first now this is not
07:03 - fun
07:04 - most people don't you know brag about
07:06 - using these algorithms but they're
07:08 - really important to understand and they
07:09 - are fundamental and if you actually want
07:11 - to understand how things work and kind
07:12 - of slowly progress in the correct order
07:14 - this is where I would say you should
07:16 - start the first algorithm I always
07:18 - recommend you learn is called linear
07:20 - regression it's a very simple anyone
07:23 - above the age of 14 or 15 should be
07:25 - understand how this works just based on
07:26 - some simple math principles and it is
07:28 - powerful in being able to predict some
07:30 - specific information now just before I
07:33 - go too far I do have a tutorial series
07:34 - on my channel that kind of covers the
07:36 - sequence that I'm talking about here if
07:38 - you'd like to check that out there is a
07:39 - card here but continue watching the
07:41 - video before you go over to that so the
07:42 - next thing that I say you should learn
07:44 - after linear regression is K nearest
07:46 - neighbors now some more advanced
07:48 - algorithm and is very very powerful K
07:51 - nearest neighbors is used for tons of
07:52 - different applications and even some of
07:54 - the most advanced AI we have uses K
07:57 - nearest neighbors to do specific things
07:58 - and to cluster information now this
08:01 - one's nice because it's kind of a
08:02 - different flavor from linear regression
08:04 - it's not predicting a number but it's
08:06 - actually classifying information into
08:08 - groups now you'll see how that works
08:10 - when you kind of learn this but I just
08:12 - want to tell you that these are
08:13 - different algorithms they do very
08:15 - different things now the next thing I
08:17 - recommend you learn is support vector
08:19 - machines now these are more advanced
08:21 - they do with high dimensional data and
08:23 - this is where your math is going to be
08:25 - tested a little bit and understanding
08:26 - exactly how these work now once you've
08:29 - done these three algorithms and I mean
08:31 - you've done them you understand exactly
08:33 - how they work you practice them on a few
08:35 - different data sets I will kind of allow
08:37 - you to move into whatever area you want
08:39 - now and I'm gonna give you some
08:40 - suggestions but what I mean is I always
08:42 - want people to get started with B's
08:44 - because this teaches you the basics of
08:46 - machine learning which I've talked about
08:47 - before data selection data cleaning the
08:49 - importance of data
08:51 - and really just you know having an
08:52 - appreciation for how difficult it is to
08:54 - make an accurate model so once you've
08:57 - done this now you can kind of move into
08:59 - the area that you're most interested in
09:01 - now I usually recommend starting with
09:03 - something simpler like q-learning which
09:05 - is actually a very powerful algorithm
09:07 - that's used usually to train things to
09:09 - play like video games it's known as
09:11 - reinforcement learning and that's its
09:12 - whole own strain of artificial
09:14 - intelligence and machine learning but
09:16 - once you've kind of done cue learning
09:18 - you can do things like the neural
09:19 - networks you can do like computer vision
09:22 - you can do all of these different things
09:24 - but start with those three things so
09:26 - linear regression K nearest neighbors
09:27 - and support vector machines and then
09:29 - move to where you want to go cue
09:31 - learning is good if you're trying to
09:32 - train video games to play things neural
09:34 - networks are just PI used for everything
09:36 - and there's tons of tutorials out there
09:37 - I have a tutorial on my channel or how
09:39 - to use neural networks as well and then
09:41 - there's some other different strains of
09:42 - AI that you'll start to learn as you
09:44 - move more into this field alright so for
09:46 - those of you that watch the video up
09:47 - until this point I want to start by
09:49 - saying thank you and I want to leave you
09:50 - guys with something to reward you for
09:52 - really actually paying attention and
09:53 - doing this now I'm assuming most of you
09:55 - have some experience with programming
09:57 - but if you don't you're brand new to
09:58 - Python and you really just want to get
09:59 - started I do have a premium programming
10:02 - course that goes through the basics of
10:03 - Python and covers everything that you
10:05 - need to know to get ready for machine
10:07 - learning if you'd like to enroll in that
10:08 - I'm going to be giving you guys 30% off
10:10 - just for watching the rest of this video
