00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back so in
00:01 - this video what I would be doing is
00:03 - showing you how you can host a MySQL
00:05 - server remotely and that means we're
00:06 - actually going to run this on a Linux
00:08 - server and then be able to connect to it
00:10 - from any machine that we'd like assuming
00:12 - that we set up the permissions and all
00:13 - of that correctly so kind of the basic
00:15 - process here is gonna be set up a Linux
00:17 - server to host this MySQL get our users
00:19 - kind of configured in MySQL and then use
00:22 - some kind of code here which is going to
00:24 - be this Python code which you've worked
00:25 - with before and try to connect to that
00:27 - server and make sure that everything's
00:28 - working so let's go ahead and get
00:30 - started and set up our server so the
00:32 - first thing we need is a linux server
00:34 - now fortunately for us the node has
00:35 - actually sponsored this video which
00:37 - means they're gonna be giving you guys
00:38 - $20 off which essentially allows you to
00:41 - have a server for free for four months
00:43 - now to gain access is free $20 and use
00:46 - these servers you can click the link in
00:48 - the description it's full node comm
00:49 - slash tech with Tim or you can use the
00:51 - code twt 19 now if you guys aren't
00:54 - interested in actually hosting the MySQL
00:56 - server and you want to use this for
00:57 - something else the note essentially
00:59 - allows you to kind of host anything like
01:01 - if it can run on Linux you can host this
01:03 - on the nodes like a website I don't know
01:06 - an app whatever it is a MySQL server
01:08 - minecraft server anything that runs on
01:10 - Linux you can Brown the node so you can
01:12 - use that and fortunately for us the node
01:15 - actually has ten data centers which
01:16 - means you can pretty much get low
01:18 - latency wherever you are in the world
01:20 - and another cool fact about this is that
01:22 - they're actually opening a new data
01:24 - center in Sydney Australia by the end of
01:27 - the year so that's exciting for any of
01:28 - you Ozzy's out there that might be
01:29 - falling because I know they usually
01:31 - don't have much hosting in Australia so
01:33 - is that's enough about lenôtre what
01:35 - we're gonna do now you start actually
01:36 - setting up our server so again if you
01:39 - guys have a Linux server you don't need
01:40 - to do this process but I'm just gonna
01:42 - walk you through because I assume some
01:43 - of you will follow along with me on this
01:44 - I'm gonna choose my distribution I've
01:46 - just done this by clicking create
01:48 - lenôtre that's how we set one up after I
01:51 - clicked on deploy my linux server then
01:53 - we're gonna go a bun to nineteen point
01:54 - 0.4 you can choose whatever version of
01:56 - ubuntu you want or whatever image as
01:58 - long as you know to work with it but a
01:59 - bun two is gonna be the one I'm using
02:00 - for now for regions I'm going to select
02:03 - my region as Toronto Ontario and for my
02:05 - plan I'm gonna go to nan owed one
02:07 - gigabyte which is five dollars a month
02:09 - which essentially means you can run this
02:11 - for free for four months
02:12 - if you've taken advantage of that free
02:13 - $20 now for my label here this is the
02:16 - name of the server I'm just gonna call
02:17 - this MySQL server very creatively and
02:21 - then for my password make sure you guys
02:23 - remember what this password is because
02:25 - this is what you're gonna use to
02:26 - actually log in to your MySQL server so
02:28 - I've made mine here again make sure you
02:31 - remember okay so once we've done this
02:32 - that's all we need to do we'll click on
02:34 - create' give it a minute or two to boot
02:36 - up and then once it's booted up I will
02:38 - be back and we'll be working with the
02:39 - server
02:41 - okay so I've booted up my server now
02:43 - everything seems to be working you can
02:45 - see that it says running here at the top
02:47 - right hand corner says so we know that
02:48 - everything's good now for this tutorial
02:50 - what we're actually gonna be doing is
02:51 - downloading a program called putty which
02:53 - is gonna allow us to SSH into our server
02:56 - in kind of a really easy way and that
02:58 - just means it will actually be able to
02:59 - modify some things and work with it from
03:01 - this computer now the node has a
03:03 - solution for this built into the website
03:05 - if you click on launch console you'll
03:06 - get a little SSH window that's here it's
03:09 - pretty minimal but if you just want to
03:10 - go in do some basic things you can use
03:12 - that but since we're gonna be working
03:13 - with a lot of commands and copying and
03:14 - pasting stuff we're gonna be dealing
03:16 - with honey so what we need to do is
03:18 - download putty I'll leave a link in the
03:20 - description it's free doesn't take up
03:22 - much space it's like a few megabytes and
03:23 - then once you have it downloaded we're
03:25 - gonna open it up and run it now here is
03:28 - where we're actually going to connect to
03:29 - our server now I'm gonna make this a bit
03:32 - bigger so you guys can see it well the
03:33 - first thing that we need to find is the
03:35 - IP address of our server so if you're on
03:37 - the node the way you can find that is by
03:39 - going to ipv4 tab here I'll zoom in a
03:41 - bit so you guys can see it or looking at
03:43 - the after the @ sign of your SSH access
03:45 - that's gonna be your IP address for the
03:48 - server
03:48 - other than that I'm assuming if you have
03:49 - your own Linux server you know the IP
03:51 - address so we're just gonna paste it in
03:53 - this host name or IP address attribute
03:55 - of putty here and then what I'm gonna do
03:57 - is change the font size of my window so
03:59 - that I can actually see it when we're
04:01 - doing this because it starts out very
04:03 - small so let's click on appearance I'll
04:05 - click on change and then I'll go to 20
04:08 - like that so you guys can see it okay so
04:09 - once we have that we'll make sure this
04:11 - is typed in correctly port 22 is fine
04:13 - and we will click open now the first
04:15 - time you run this you'll probably see a
04:17 - window that says warning just click yes
04:19 - that's fine don't worry about it
04:21 - we're gonna log in to our server as the
04:22 - root user now we're gonna type route as
04:25 - login and the password is gonna be
04:26 - whatever that root password is that we
04:28 - created and you won't see it when you're
04:29 - typing it so just type it then hit enter
04:31 - okay so now we're in we're on our server
04:34 - and we can actually start installing the
04:36 - MySQL server so the first thing that
04:38 - we're gonna do is just install MySQL so
04:41 - to do that we're gonna type sudo apt I
04:44 - can get install MySQL - server like that
04:49 - I'm gonna run that give it a second it's
04:51 - gonna ask us to type yes we'll hit yes
04:53 - and wait for this to be done and then
04:56 - it'll be back okay so now we have
04:57 - actually successfully installed MySQL on
05:00 - this server and what we need to do now
05:01 - is kind of configure it set up a few
05:03 - things that allow remote access because
05:05 - by default MySQL is localhost which
05:08 - means you can only connect to it locally
05:10 - from the server and that's fine in most
05:11 - cases because sometimes you'll actually
05:13 - run like a MySQL server on the same
05:15 - machine as a website and in that case
05:17 - you only need localhost
05:18 - access because you're on the same
05:20 - machine so you can modify the database
05:22 - directly from the website but in our
05:23 - case we need a remote so what we're
05:25 - gonna do now is type and actually open
05:27 - up the what is it called like the
05:30 - command I gotta look at my other screen
05:32 - to remember this it's like a command
05:34 - utility window for MySQL which will
05:36 - allow us to modify some security issues
05:38 - so we gonna say MySQL underscore secure
05:40 - underscore installation and then we're
05:44 - gonna say utility if I spell that
05:46 - correctly okay so now we have that so
05:49 - sudo MySQL underscore secure underscore
05:51 - installation space utility now it's
05:54 - gonna ask us a few things here it's
05:55 - gonna say validate password plug-in can
05:57 - be used to test passwords and improve
05:59 - security we want this to be secure so
06:01 - we're gonna type Y for yes and validate
06:04 - our password so we're gonna enter what
06:06 - the minimum strength of a password could
06:08 - be for us to log in so in this case I'm
06:10 - gonna choose to actually I'm gonna shoot
06:12 - 0 as low because I just want to do a
06:14 - basic password for this but you guys
06:16 - could do strong and that means every
06:17 - time you create a new user it needs to
06:19 - have a strong password okay so I'll type
06:21 - 0 now it's gonna ask us for a root
06:23 - password before our MySQL server I'd
06:25 - recommend you just make sure that this
06:28 - is a strong password and that you
06:29 - recommend or you remember it because
06:31 - this is how you're actually going to be
06:33 - able to log into
06:33 - like the admin part of my SQL and modify
06:37 - everything in set permissions so you
06:38 - don't want anyone accidentally getting
06:40 - in here so I'm gonna set my password
06:42 - here and I'm not gonna tell you guys
06:44 - what it is and then it's gonna say
06:48 - estimated strength of the password 100
06:49 - whatever it is and then you can just go
06:51 - ahead and click why okay so now it's
06:54 - gonna say remove anonymous users we can
06:56 - do that that's fine we'll click yes we
06:58 - don't need those and then it says
07:00 - normally root should only be allowed to
07:01 - connect from local host this ensures
07:03 - that someone cannot guess at the root
07:05 - password from the network we'll go ahead
07:07 - and we'll we will hit yes as well this
07:10 - just means that there's no way that you
07:12 - can login to the MySQL server as the
07:14 - root user unless you're actually on the
07:16 - machine and that's fine then it's gonna
07:18 - say remove test database and access to
07:19 - it we will hit yes as well and remove
07:21 - that reload privilege tables now and we
07:25 - will hit yes once again and hit enter so
07:27 - again this process you guys can change
07:29 - what goes on here but that's kind of my
07:31 - recommended security settings and now
07:33 - we're ready to get in and actually
07:34 - creating a user and changing a few
07:36 - things so that this can be seen by any
07:38 - machine so what we need to do now is
07:40 - actually set up a basic firewall on this
07:42 - machine so to do this we're gonna say
07:44 - sudo ufw enable which is just setting up
07:48 - like a really basic firewall command
07:50 - maybe just Rob yep that's fine we'll
07:52 - click yes so now it says firewall is
07:54 - active and enabled on system startup now
07:57 - what we're gonna do is say sudo ufw
08:00 - allow MySQL which essentially means
08:03 - we're gonna allow MySQL to kind of
08:05 - bypass this firewall and you know see
08:08 - other connections okay so now that we
08:10 - have that we need to actually mess with
08:12 - kind of a complicated setting of MySQL
08:14 - which is the server binding now to gain
08:17 - access to this file where this is we
08:19 - need to CD into a certain directory I'm
08:21 - actually gonna copy it in here because I
08:23 - am NOT going to remember what this is
08:25 - just from my other monitor so what we're
08:27 - gonna do is we're gonna CD into etc'
08:32 - MySQL MySQL comp dot d and hit enter so
08:36 - this is the directory path now if you
08:40 - want to go like level by level you can
08:42 - like CD into e.t.c then CD into MySQL
08:45 - then CD into the next row
08:46 - three but this is the command you guys
08:49 - can pause the video and type that it
08:50 - okay so now we're in this correct
08:52 - directory so now what we're gonna do is
08:53 - actually use Nano to modify a specific
08:56 - file now the file we need is gonna be my
08:59 - SQL D dot C and F so gonna say Nano
09:03 - mysqld dot CNF and Nano is just a very
09:06 - basic text editor so now we're in Nano
09:08 - to navigate through Nano you're gonna
09:09 - use the arrow keys so I'm gonna scroll
09:11 - down until I see something that says
09:14 - binding so it says bind address here
09:17 - so you can see that the default value is
09:20 - 127.0.0.1 now what that means is this is
09:23 - actually only binded to localhost which
09:26 - means that only localhost which is the
09:28 - actual machine can access the server we
09:30 - obviously don't want that we want to
09:31 - build to access that from outside of
09:33 - this so what we're gonna do is change
09:34 - this to 0 dot 0 dot 0 dot 0 which is
09:39 - gonna mean that anything can access this
09:41 - server so it's binding to it essentially
09:43 - any IP address that the server has which
09:45 - means we can access it from anywhere
09:46 - else so now we're gonna save this by
09:48 - hitting ctrl s so that saves and exit by
09:51 - hitting ctrl X ok so now that we've done
09:54 - that what we need to do now is simply
09:55 - set up a user that we can actually use
09:58 - to access the database setup a basic
10:00 - database and then we'll be good to
10:02 - connect from our Python code okay so I
10:04 - almost forgot a few important commands
10:06 - here we want to make sure that MySQL is
10:08 - always running on the server whether we
10:10 - turn it off or reboot it or whatever so
10:13 - we're gonna start gonna add this as a
10:14 - service now the command to do this is
10:17 - sudo and I have to look at my other
10:18 - screen otherwise I'm gonna mess this up
10:20 - system CTL start MySQL so what this has
10:25 - done now is started the MySQL service
10:28 - and now what we're gonna do is make sure
10:29 - that the service runs continuously so to
10:32 - do that this command is pseudo system so
10:36 - it's actually the same at the beginning
10:38 - and then it is an able so enable my SQL
10:43 - ok so there we go and now we are good to
10:46 - go so it says it's executed this we've
10:48 - had this so now we've set up MySQL we
10:50 - start it we've enabled it and now what
10:51 - we're gonna do is restart it to make
10:53 - sure that these settings are safe so to
10:56 - do that one we're gonna do sudo
10:59 - I got her look at this again system
11:02 - systemctl restart my SQL okay oops did I
11:09 - do something wrong
11:10 - yep I need to spell system correctly so
11:13 - suitum sudo systemctl restart mysql okay
11:17 - so now we've restarted and now we're
11:19 - actually gonna go into the mysql
11:20 - settings and start modifying some things
11:22 - so to do this we're gonna type mysql - u
11:25 - which stands for user we're gonna type
11:27 - root which is the root user then we're
11:29 - going to type - Pete I was gonna ask you
11:31 - for your password this will be the
11:33 - password we set up when we went into
11:34 - that utility so make sure you that you
11:36 - know what that one is there we go so
11:39 - I've typed it in I'm now in the MySQL
11:41 - console and this actually will now allow
11:43 - us to type my SQL queries as well as to
11:45 - grant access to specific users so the
11:48 - first thing I'm actually gonna do is
11:49 - create a database so i'm gonna say
11:51 - create database test let's keep it lower
11:55 - case like that
11:56 - and I'm gonna end this with a semicolon
11:58 - so let's hit enter it says query okay
12:00 - one row effected and now we've created
12:03 - test database and the reason I've done
12:04 - this is because we're gonna give access
12:06 - to our user to this specific database on
12:09 - our MySQL server so now what I'm gonna
12:11 - do is I'm actually gonna type grant all
12:14 - on test dot star now what this is saying
12:19 - is I'm gonna grant all permissions on
12:21 - the database test and test dot star just
12:24 - means any tables inside the database if
12:27 - you wanted to grant access to a specific
12:28 - table like say we had a table called
12:30 - users then we would do test dot users
12:33 - and that would give this user specific
12:34 - access just to the user table from this
12:36 - database but I want them to have access
12:39 - to all so I will stay start and if you
12:42 - wanted to just grant access say maybe
12:43 - you just want them to be able to select
12:45 - data like just look at data in the
12:46 - database you would say grant select if
12:48 - you wanted you know grant select and
12:50 - update or if you wanted like grant
12:53 - select I'm trying to think of other
12:56 - queries you could do here I guess create
12:58 - delete you could do that and that will
13:01 - give that user specific access to those
13:03 - commands so I'm gonna say grant all on
13:07 - test dot star and then what I'm gonna do
13:10 - is actually type kind of a complicated
13:11 - thing so I'm just going to look to make
13:12 - sure
13:12 - don't mess this up I'm gonna type too
13:15 - and in this case we're gonna type the
13:17 - name of our user which is Tim @ and now
13:20 - this is where it gets kind of
13:21 - complicated we need to actually get the
13:23 - IP address of the machine that's gonna
13:25 - be accessing this so right now we set up
13:27 - a linux server we have my school running
13:29 - and now we're actually gonna give access
13:31 - to a specific machine to access this
13:34 - server so to find the IP address of your
13:37 - computer you can literally just go into
13:39 - google and type my IP address now I'm
13:43 - not gonna do that because that would
13:44 - show you guys what my IP address is but
13:47 - let's just do a like you know test
13:48 - example see you guys see what I mean so
13:50 - I'm gonna do two Tim and then you would
13:52 - type whatever that IP address is so you
13:54 - search my IP address you find your
13:56 - public IP address and you put it here
13:58 - let's just say it's like 172.16.0.0 that
14:15 - we want now in this case I'm just gonna
14:16 - make a password like one two three four
14:18 - five six but you guys should make this a
14:20 - secure password because this is gonna be
14:22 - how you access the database remotely
14:24 - from that specific machine so quick
14:26 - recap because this is the most important
14:27 - part I'm sorry I'm dragging this on
14:28 - grant all on database that you want then
14:32 - whatever table or you know all of them
14:35 - with star to the username that you're
14:38 - gonna log in with which in this case is
14:39 - Tim at sign the IP address of whatever
14:42 - machine is gonna be logging into this so
14:44 - the public IP address you can find that
14:46 - by looking on Google identified by some
14:48 - password in quotation marks okay so once
14:51 - we have that we're gonna hit enter sorry
14:54 - we're gonna put a semicolon then we're
14:55 - gonna hit enter I'm getting an error
14:57 - because it's saying my password is not
14:59 - strong enough but I will set that in and
15:02 - then move on so now that we've done this
15:04 - we're actually done everything that we
15:05 - need to do on the MySQL Linux server and
15:08 - we can actually start messing with this
15:10 - from our Python code and that's the part
15:12 - I'll get into now okay so we finished
15:13 - everything on the linux server hopefully
15:15 - for you guys that query worked again
15:17 - you're gonna use your public IP address
15:19 - and then put the password and so
15:21 - identified by you know that string
15:22 - password okay so I hope you haven't
15:24 - forgotten the server IP address because
15:26 - we
15:26 - still need that so here I mean some
15:28 - Python code this should look familiar if
15:29 - you followed the previous tutorials
15:30 - otherwise what you need to do is install
15:33 - MySQL connector on this machine then
15:36 - you're gonna set up a database
15:37 - connection like this and here what we're
15:40 - gonna do now is for our connection
15:41 - rather than using the localhost
15:43 - connection which we had before
15:44 - we're actually going to use the IP
15:45 - address of the server that's running -
15:47 - cool so that Linux server that we've
15:49 - created now - here so I will take this
15:52 - IP address copy that again put that as
15:55 - the host I'm gonna put that username as
15:57 - whatever the user was that we had before
15:59 - so whatever one we created so like Tim
16:01 - act right and then our password is gonna
16:04 - be whatever password it is now this is
16:05 - the password I set strong password one
16:07 - two three four star I know makes sense
16:10 - and now what we're gonna do is just run
16:12 - this and see if we get any errors so if
16:14 - you run this and there's no issues
16:16 - there's no errors that pop up you can
16:18 - create a database cursor you've set up
16:20 - this connection you are fine and you're
16:22 - actually good to go and start working
16:23 - with this like it was any other database
