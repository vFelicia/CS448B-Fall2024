00:02 - [Music]
00:08 - in this video i'm going to show you how
00:10 - to work with json data in python as fast
00:13 - as possible so to get started json
00:15 - stands for javascript object notation
00:17 - now this is a standard language
00:19 - javascript is really not an important
00:21 - part of the name although it was
00:22 - originally based on javascript now the
00:24 - syntax for json is very similar to that
00:26 - of a python dictionary you can see this
00:28 - a valid json string right here we start
00:31 - with our curly braces we have a key that
00:33 - key is associated with some type of
00:34 - value in this case it's an array or a
00:36 - list then inside of here i have other
00:38 - json objects i have keys i have values i
00:41 - can represent numbers strings etc now
00:44 - one important note in json is you have
00:45 - to use double quotation marks not single
00:47 - quotation marks like you can use in
00:49 - python now json data is commonly used
00:51 - for configuration files storing some
00:53 - type of data or commonly for api so if
00:56 - you ever worked with an api before
00:58 - you've probably received data back in
00:59 - json and had to send data as json as
01:02 - well so let's see how we can take a
01:04 - string that is representing json data
01:06 - and actually load that in as a json
01:08 - object or a python dictionary because
01:10 - look looks very similar to a python
01:12 - dictionary that means we're probably
01:13 - going to use a python dictionary to
01:14 - represent it so to do this is very
01:16 - simple what i can do is type data is
01:19 - equal to json.load s now i'm doing s
01:22 - because we're loading a string you can
01:23 - also load a json file which i will show
01:25 - you in a second and then here i'm going
01:27 - to put json string now if i print out my
01:30 - data you're going to see that i get all
01:32 - of the data here except it's actually in
01:34 - a python dictionary so if i go ahead and
01:37 - print out data at and let's just do the
01:39 - key students now you're going to see
01:41 - that this works i can get all of my
01:43 - students i could also access say the
01:45 - first index here and you'll see that i
01:47 - get that individual stu now since i
01:49 - forgot to mention this i did import the
01:51 - json library to be able to do this this
01:53 - is built into the standard library of
01:55 - python this means you don't need to
01:57 - install it it's right here you can just
01:58 - import it and then use it like this
02:00 - anyways that's as easy as it is to
02:02 - actually load data in using the json
02:04 - library we have a json string we use
02:06 - json.load make sure we have the s at the
02:08 - end put the string it gives us a python
02:11 - dictionary now if we have an error here
02:13 - in our json string this will give us an
02:15 - error as well so just keep that in mind
02:16 - if you're trying to load a string that's
02:18 - not valid json then it's not going to
02:19 - work you're going to get an error so in
02:20 - the same way that we can load a string
02:22 - that is json data we can dump a python
02:24 - dictionary into json formats let me show
02:27 - you how we do that now we have a
02:29 - dictionary already it's the data
02:30 - dictionary let's just add a key to it so
02:32 - let's say data at test
02:35 - is equal to true okay just a random key
02:38 - here now if i want to dump this into a
02:39 - json string i can do the following so
02:41 - i'll just say new underscore json is
02:43 - equal to and then i'm going to use json
02:45 - dot and then this is going to be dump s
02:47 - again because we want a string not a
02:49 - file then i'm going to put here the
02:51 - dictionary that i want to dump which is
02:53 - data so now if i print out new json
02:56 - you see that we get our json data
02:58 - printed out like this great now one
03:01 - other thing that we can do here when we
03:02 - are dumping our json data into a string
03:05 - is we can pass the argument indent now
03:07 - this will actually give us a nicely
03:08 - formatted json string with the proper
03:11 - indentation so in this case if i go
03:12 - indent two that's the indentation level
03:14 - it's going to give us so let's actually
03:16 - print this out now and notice we get a
03:18 - nicely formatted json string now if i
03:20 - want a higher indentation
03:22 - i can do four and of course now i get
03:24 - kind of the tab indentation that we
03:25 - usually use now another thing that i can
03:27 - do is pass something called sort keys
03:29 - pretty intuitive this is going to sort
03:31 - the keys in our json data so if i do
03:34 - this now notice we have age full time id
03:36 - and name whereas in here we had id name
03:38 - age full time great that's as easy as it
03:41 - is to work with json strings now i want
03:44 - to show you how to work with json files
03:46 - all right so i've just created a json
03:47 - file here in the same directory as my
03:49 - python script it just has the same data
03:51 - i had before in that string but i've
03:53 - called it data dot json now one
03:55 - important difference here with json and
03:57 - python is when you're doing the booleans
03:58 - you're going to have lowercase so i have
04:00 - true with a lowercase t non-uppercase
04:02 - just figured i would mention that okay
04:04 - so that is my data i'm now in my python
04:06 - script let's say i want to load in this
04:08 - data file and get access to it as a
04:10 - python dictionary how would i do that
04:12 - well it's very simple but i first need
04:13 - to open the file so i'm going to say
04:15 - with open i'm going to put my file name
04:17 - which is data.json
04:19 - i'm going to open this in read mode i'm
04:21 - going to open this as f then what i can
04:24 - do is the following i can say my data is
04:26 - equal to json json.load now notice how
04:29 - i'm not doing the s this time because
04:30 - i'm loading from a file and i'm going to
04:32 - put the file object that i just opened
04:34 - which in this case is f now what i can
04:36 - do here is simply print the data and
04:39 - when i do this i get my data again as a
04:41 - python dictionary to prove this to you
04:43 - we can print out the items and you'll
04:45 - see that we get our dict items all right
04:47 - there we go that is how you load json
04:49 - data from a file now let's see how we
04:51 - can write json data to a file so again
04:53 - we have our data right here if i want to
04:56 - write to a file i need to open a file in
04:58 - write mode and then use json.dumps so
05:01 - i'm just going to use the same
05:02 - dictionary that i have right here so i'm
05:03 - going to say with
05:05 - open this is going to be
05:07 - data2.json we're going to open this in
05:09 - write mode because we're creating a new
05:11 - file i'm going to say as f and now i'm
05:13 - going to say json
05:15 - dot dump notice no s right just dump
05:18 - then i'm going to put the data that i
05:19 - want to dump which in this case is data
05:21 - and the file i want to dump it to which
05:23 - is f okay let's go ahead and run this
05:26 - and now if i go to data2.json you're
05:28 - going to see that i have my json data in
05:30 - here now it's not formatted nicely but
05:32 - that's fine you usually don't care about
05:33 - the formatting when you're dumping it to
05:35 - a font all right so that has been json
05:37 - in python as fast as possible there's a
05:39 - few other things you can do with this
05:41 - however this is really all you need to
05:42 - know to be able to load data save data
05:45 - load data from a file and save data to a
05:47 - file i hope this was helpful to you if
