00:00 - now to the right of me here is the van
00:02 - cube II reading lamp and it is probably
00:04 - the most expensive lamp you have ever
00:06 - seen and I know that I have ever owned
00:09 - now in this video I'm gonna talk about a
00:11 - few features of this lamp and if I think
00:13 - it warrants the massive price tag that
00:14 - comes along with it so this lamp retails
00:18 - for just under two hundred US dollars
00:20 - and to be transparent I do need to
00:22 - mention that I was sent this lamp for
00:24 - free from BenQ with the purpose of
00:26 - making a review video about it now it is
00:28 - designed for people that sit and stare
00:30 - at their monitor for multiple hours a
00:32 - day it's meant to reduce strain and
00:34 - stress on your eyes by producing
00:36 - sufficient and accurate lighting and
00:38 - what I mean by that is the temperature
00:40 - and brightness of the light that you're
00:41 - actually getting the standout feature of
00:43 - this lamp is the fact that you can hold
00:45 - down the touch ring like I am right now
00:47 - they will automatically adjust the
00:49 - temperature and brightness of the light
00:51 - based on the surroundings so that means
00:53 - if you need a brighter light or a dimmer
00:56 - light or a different temperature light
00:57 - it will automatically sense that and
00:59 - change that for you now you can see here
01:01 - the L so the amount of light this lamp
01:03 - actually gives off it's really nice
01:04 - because that curvature at the top allows
01:06 - it to light up almost your entire
01:08 - working desk surface so you can work on
01:10 - your computer as well as your desk and
01:12 - this lamp is anti glare and anti flicker
01:15 - now right here I'm just demonstrating
01:17 - turning on and off the lamp using the
01:20 - touch ring this is a super sensitive
01:21 - ring that essentially any slight touch
01:24 - will toggle it to go on and off which
01:25 - can be a good thing and a bad thing
01:27 - which I'll talk about later now this is
01:29 - the dimming ring here which allows you
01:31 - to adjust the brightness as well as the
01:33 - temperature by simply clicking down on
01:35 - the middle of that ring if you can
01:36 - change what one you're changing so once
01:39 - you're done changing the temperature
01:40 - then you can change the brightness by
01:41 - just clicking down the next features of
01:44 - this lamp is the build quality which is
01:47 - absolutely amazing as you would expect
01:49 - from a two hundred dollar lamp it's made
01:51 - completely of metal not sure exactly
01:53 - which type and it's adjustable in almost
01:55 - every way now there are slight
01:56 - restrictions on how far you can move
01:58 - everything but you can see that I can
02:00 - put this lamp pretty high up and pretty
02:02 - far out as well as adjusting the head
02:04 - which you guys will see in just one
02:06 - second now this head adjustment is
02:08 - actually great because it allows
02:10 - to use this as a facecam light as well
02:12 - which what I've been doing for the past
02:13 - few videos and since I can change the
02:15 - temperature I can make sure it looks
02:17 - perfect in my YouTube videos now a next
02:19 - feature to talk about it's just some
02:21 - thinking by Ben Q here which I haven't
02:22 - seen before
02:23 - and it is actually the kind of wiring
02:25 - and cabling that this lamp has now you
02:28 - guys are gonna see in a sec but the
02:29 - power supply is actually separate from
02:31 - the cable which allows you to plug that
02:33 - in and then you can run the cable down
02:35 - maybe a skinny area of your the back of
02:37 - your desk and plug it into this power
02:39 - supply which is something that's really
02:41 - nice and something I like to see being
02:43 - thought of by these companies because
02:44 - I've never seen anything quite like that
02:46 - before now this is actually another
02:49 - feature as well this cable runs right up
02:51 - the actual interior of the lamp which
02:53 - means you don't have to see kind of
02:54 - those ugly cables moving around which is
02:56 - always a nice feature now here I just
02:58 - want to demonstrate the actual
02:59 - brightness of the lamp and the
03:02 - temperature change by putting this on a
03:03 - great backdrop so you can see here I'm
03:05 - just adjusting this brightness right now
03:07 - and when I click down on that ring I can
03:08 - change the temperature and you guys can
03:10 - actually see the amount of adjustment
03:12 - you get so you can have that warm
03:13 - reading light or kind of that white
03:15 - light that's meant for maybe more
03:16 - working and getting stuff done now when
03:19 - I hold down that touch ring like I am
03:20 - right now it's gonna sense the light in
03:22 - the room and then it just accordingly
03:24 - now any good design needs to be both
03:26 - functional and good-looking and I think
03:28 - that BenQ has really hit the nail on the
03:30 - head here I personally really like the
03:33 - look of this lamp I like that is sleek
03:34 - it's modern and the way that it kind of
03:36 - hangs over my monitor just works well
03:39 - for me it's also very functional in the
03:41 - sense that it gives you a ton of light
03:43 - and just that extra curvature is a
03:45 - really great engineering design and
03:46 - allows you to actually have the entire
03:48 - working area of your desk lit up which
03:50 - is something that I've never had from
03:52 - any other lamp so you guys can be your
03:53 - own judge whether you like the look or
03:55 - not but it definitely does work well for
03:57 - me and I do really like it so now for
03:59 - some of my final thoughts on the Ben qu
04:01 - reading lamp and I'll say it right away
04:03 - this is an amazing lamp and if you guys
04:05 - do have the budget to pick it up I
04:07 - definitely would recommend it now the
04:09 - first thing that I really want to tell
04:10 - you about is how much of a difference
04:12 - this actually makes in viewing your
04:13 - monitor now I don't know why this is
04:15 - about a scientist all I know is that
04:18 - when I view the monitor with
04:19 - oh this lamp on I notice a difference
04:22 - now I think it's because when that lamp
04:24 - is on you it just allows your eyes to
04:27 - relax because you're giving enough light
04:28 - to it I think a lot of people work with
04:30 - either no lights on like in your own
04:32 - room and just the monitor or all the
04:35 - lights on and then the monitors screen
04:36 - as well now the issue with having all
04:38 - the lights on is that you get glare and
04:40 - it's just more difficult to see crisp
04:42 - images on your monitor now a great thing
04:44 - with this lamp is there's absolutely no
04:46 - glare on the screen and that's kind of
04:48 - the main selling point of this lamp as
04:49 - well so by just having it over top of
04:52 - the monitor like that that extra light I
04:53 - think just allows your eyes to relax and
04:55 - it really does make a massive difference
04:57 - now the second point I really like about
04:59 - this lamp is the amount of light that it
05:01 - actually gives off in kind of that cone
05:03 - shape I have a very large desk here as
05:05 - you guys can see and I've always had an
05:08 - issue with regular lamps on trying to
05:09 - see and work on paper on my desk and
05:12 - then work on my computer at the same
05:13 - time I had to either adjust the lamp or
05:15 - I was getting a glare there was just
05:17 - always something wrong now with this and
05:19 - the amount of light this really gives
05:20 - off it almost covers my entire working
05:23 - area of the desk and it just makes it a
05:25 - lot easier to actually do work I think a
05:27 - lot of people underestimate the value of
05:29 - light and I definitely did until I
05:31 - actually received this lamp and saw the
05:32 - massive difference that it made now
05:34 - again it's also crazily adjustable you
05:37 - can put it on every angle everywhere so
05:39 - if I'm working or I just want to read or
05:41 - something I can simply just shift the
05:43 - lamp over slightly so that it covers
05:44 - wherever I needed to cover and that's
05:46 - something that I really like about it
05:47 - now the only - kind of finicky details
05:50 - that I have about it that I don't like
05:51 - our one of the sensitivity of the touch
05:54 - sensor now this one is something that
05:57 - I've noticed a lot and it might just be
05:59 - the way that I do it and I just might be
06:01 - you know weird and how I do this but
06:02 - when I go to adjust the rim there to
06:05 - spin it and change the brightness of the
06:07 - temperature I very often accidentally
06:09 - hit the touch sensor and turn the light
06:11 - off now it's because I believe that that
06:14 - spinny thing like that I don't know the
06:15 - wheel is so close to the touch sensor
06:18 - that when you come in like usually what
06:20 - ends up happening as my knuckles will
06:21 - hit that touch sensor and it's super
06:23 - sensitive and it turns off now I just
06:25 - have to learn to be more careful when I
06:26 - go up and adjust that so that I don't
06:28 - actually accidentally turn it off but I
06:29 - figured it was something that I would
06:30 - mention the next thing and this is
06:32 - probably gonna be kind of surprising to
06:34 - you is even though the base of this lamp
06:36 - is super heavy it doesn't actually hold
06:39 - perfectly when you're adjusting the lamp
06:41 - I noticed that in a might just be
06:43 - because of how tight the joints are in
06:44 - my lab but when I try to move the lamp
06:47 - around and adjust it very often that
06:50 - base will kind of pop up just an inch or
06:52 - two off the table now that's because I
06:54 - have mine very far out and that won't
06:57 - happen if you have yours kind of more up
06:58 - because mine's like extended as far as
07:01 - they can go but it is a detail that I
07:02 - figured I would mention to you guys so
07:04 - with that being said this been QE
07:06 - reading lamp is a great lamp if you have
07:08 - the budget I definitely recommend it
07:10 - there's a link down below and one last
07:12 - thank you to BenQ for sending me this
07:14 - lamp for free I definitely have seen a
07:16 - massive difference now if that being
07:18 - said if you guys enjoyed the video
