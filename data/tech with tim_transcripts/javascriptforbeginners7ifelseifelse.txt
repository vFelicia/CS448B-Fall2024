00:00 - hello everybody and welcome back so in
00:01 - this video we're gonna be talking about
00:02 - if else if and else now these are ways
00:06 - to essentially check a condition before
00:08 - executing a certain block of code and
00:10 - this is very useful and what a lot of
00:12 - you guys have been asking about in the
00:13 - comments or that I've realized but like
00:15 - okay well what if I only want to run
00:17 - this piece of code if this is true or
00:19 - what if I want to do this and if this
00:21 - doesn't happen I do that well this is
00:23 - where we get into if else if and else
00:25 - which are extremely useful and kind of
00:27 - fundamental skills of the language so
00:29 - what I've done so far is I've actually
00:31 - just changed this example a little bit
00:32 - so what we have now is hello we have a
00:35 - text box and then we have a button that
00:37 - says click the reason I've done this is
00:39 - because what I want to do for this
00:40 - example is has it habet so the user can
00:43 - type something into this text box click
00:45 - click and based on what they type in
00:47 - we're actually gonna change the color of
00:49 - this field so we could change you know
00:51 - if they type in the word green this will
00:54 - change to green when they press the bug
00:55 - they type in blue this will change to
00:57 - blue when they press the button that's
00:58 - what I want to try to do so let's try to
01:01 - do that now the first thing we need to
01:03 - actually do this is an if statement so
01:05 - I'm gonna run through how an if
01:06 - statement works essentially the syntax
01:08 - for an if statement is you type the word
01:11 - if which is a keyword it'll highlight
01:13 - hopefully in this red color for you guys
01:14 - if you're in sub line then you have
01:16 - these brackets like this you put some
01:19 - kind of condition inside of these
01:21 - brackets and if this condition is true
01:23 - then whatever is inside of these curly
01:25 - braces will run if it's not true you're
01:28 - simply gonna skip over this entire if
01:30 - statement so everything that's inside of
01:31 - this block and go to the next line and
01:33 - just ignore it and not even bother doing
01:35 - it so for instance if I say if true well
01:39 - this will always run because obviously
01:41 - true is always true but you know that's
01:42 - a condition I can put that in here and
01:44 - that means essentially if I did console
01:46 - dot log something in here that would
01:48 - always run whereas if I put this to be
01:52 - false like that and then I was gonna
01:55 - console dot log this would never run
01:56 - because well this is false
01:58 - so let's actually give this a go and do
02:00 - something a little bit more advanced so
02:03 - in a real condition inside of here and
02:04 - then we'll try to do something so what
02:06 - I'm gonna do is actually grab the text
02:08 - that the user typed into my input box
02:10 - and just store that in a variable
02:11 - to start so I'm gonna save our text
02:13 - equals and in this case I guess it's
02:16 - document dot get oops element if I could
02:21 - type properly early in the morning for
02:23 - me here guys
02:24 - ID then we will do I and P which is the
02:27 - input box dot value okay so there we go
02:31 - that's gonna grab our text for us now
02:33 - what I'm simply gonna say is if text
02:35 - equals equals and I guess we'll say read
02:38 - will change the color of our header tag
02:41 - here to be read so to do that I'm gonna
02:43 - say document dot get element by ID p--
02:47 - dot style dot value equals red and I
02:53 - guess our ID is gonna be heavy like that
02:57 - okay now the only issue is I need to put
02:59 - this inside of a function so that
03:01 - essentially whenever my button is
03:02 - pressed we can activate that function
03:04 - and see what the current text value is
03:06 - so to do that what I'm gonna say is
03:08 - function pressed like this then I'm
03:12 - gonna just close my bracket here and
03:15 - indent all this so there we go
03:18 - so I know it went kind of fast there but
03:19 - essentially what I've done is create a
03:21 - function called pressed this function
03:23 - will be clicked or you know activated
03:25 - when we press this button here then we
03:27 - will get whatever we've typed as a text
03:29 - field
03:29 - check if it's equal to read if it's read
03:32 - we will change the color otherwise we
03:34 - won't do anything so let's run this now
03:36 - it's save and refresh the page so here
03:39 - notice when I click click nothing's
03:41 - happening when I type hi you know
03:43 - nothing's happening but if I type red
03:45 - then it changes hmmm alright so I
03:48 - realized I've done style dog value
03:50 - rather than style dot color so that
03:52 - would probably be why that wasn't
03:53 - working per second what I tried it out
03:55 - so I need to change that to color let me
03:57 - show you again now so I think I showed
03:58 - if I type something like Hello obviously
04:00 - nothing's gonna happen but if I type red
04:02 - and click click after this has been
04:05 - refreshed then that will change to red
04:07 - and that is because we have this style
04:09 - dot color equals red and if tax is equal
04:11 - to red that will happen ok awesome
04:13 - but what if when I press the button and
04:15 - if they didn't type in red for example I
04:18 - want it to automatically change the
04:19 - color to black so maybe you know now if
04:22 - I start typing hi well it's still the
04:24 - color
04:25 - because it's not being changed back to
04:27 - the other color so how do I do that well
04:29 - this is where we can use something
04:31 - called an else now an else essentially
04:33 - as happens anytime this if statement
04:35 - doesn't happen so whenever you have an
04:37 - if/else block like this you know that
04:39 - either the if is gonna run or the else
04:41 - is gonna run and it's pretty easy to
04:42 - read it out you say if text equals red
04:44 - do this otherwise or else do whatever is
04:49 - inside the else block and that's as easy
04:51 - as Isis so I'm just gonna copy this line
04:53 - and change it so that this makes the
04:55 - color block like this and now let's run
04:59 - this and just show you how this works
05:00 - and that should hopefully help you so we
05:02 - have hello now let's type you know you
05:04 - obviously block we're not getting
05:06 - anything let's type red that changes to
05:09 - red and then if I type I don't know no
05:11 - we get it back to black so that is how
05:15 - this works if it's not red and then it
05:17 - changes color to block if it's red then
05:20 - it changes the color to red okay
05:22 - so what if we want to be able to change
05:24 - the color to red or blue and then
05:26 - anything else goes to black well how
05:28 - would I do that well this is where we
05:29 - use what's called an else if now this so
05:32 - far I hope makes sense again you just
05:34 - have if if this condition happens
05:36 - whatever's inside of here you do this
05:38 - otherwise you do this now the else if is
05:41 - kind of an extension on top of this and
05:43 - I'll talk about how it works in a second
05:44 - but let's get the syntax down first so
05:47 - essentially the elsif is kind of a
05:48 - combination between both the else and
05:51 - the if now this is essentially saying if
05:54 - this doesn't happen so if this if
05:56 - statement doesn't run we will check if
05:59 - the condition we put here is true if
06:01 - that's true we'll do whatever is inside
06:03 - of our brackets here otherwise we'll
06:06 - come down and we'll do what's below here
06:08 - so this actually means we can have
06:09 - multiple else ifs which we'll get into
06:11 - in a second let's do another example
06:13 - here where we make this say maybe green
06:15 - and then we'll just get the element ID
06:18 - and change it to the color green so
06:20 - let's tap this in like that and go green
06:26 - alright so again the way this we're
06:28 - operating here is we're gonna start by
06:30 - checking if the tax is equal to red if
06:32 - it is boom we go red we don't even
06:34 - bother reading the rest of this we don't
06:35 - need to do it okay if it's not red what
06:38 - we'll check if it's green if it's green
06:41 - we'll change the color to green awesome
06:43 - there we go we're done we don't even
06:44 - read the else if this is not true and
06:47 - this is not true so both above the else
06:49 - aren't true then we'll run the else and
06:51 - we'll change the color to black and that
06:53 - is pretty much how this works it's
06:54 - fairly straightforward so let's refresh
06:56 - let's type green there we go it goes
06:59 - green let's type red it goes red and
07:02 - let's type blue and obviously it goes to
07:05 - black now if I want to incorporate blue
07:07 - as well what I could do is simply make
07:09 - another else--if like this I think I
07:12 - need to actually do that yes that should
07:15 - work let's put another condition here
07:17 - say text equals equals equals that
07:20 - should actually just be three let's say
07:21 - blue and then what we can do is simply
07:24 - copy this and change the color to be
07:26 - blue and this should work for us now
07:29 - again this is gonna work because we can
07:31 - have as many else ifs as we want we can
07:33 - do you know if else if else if we don't
07:35 - even need to include this else if we
07:36 - don't want to I can get rid of that I
07:38 - can have just one else if the
07:40 - combination of these is fine just know
07:42 - that if you have an else if or if you
07:44 - have an Allison there needs to be the
07:45 - initial if to start that statement so
07:48 - let's look at this now and let's try
07:50 - this so let's refresh if I type blue we
07:54 - change to blue if I type red we go to
07:57 - red if I type green we go to green and
08:00 - if I type something random nothing
08:02 - happens because that else statement is
08:04 - no longer there and that is you know
08:06 - pretty much how that works now a lot of
08:09 - people get confused with this try to do
08:11 - some examples we'll do some more as we
08:12 - go through the different videos but just
08:14 - remember you start with your if
08:15 - statement if whatever happens here
08:17 - happens is true then this runs if it
08:21 - doesn't we'll check all of the else ifs
08:22 - if any of those are true we'll execute
08:25 - that and we'll stop looking for the rest
08:27 - of them otherwise we will do any else
08:29 - statement that is at the bottom and that
08:31 - else statement will happen no matter
08:33 - what so long as you know the ones above
08:35 - it were false now we can definitely have
08:37 - more than one if statement like there's
08:40 - different ways to do this for example
08:41 - right now I'm doing else ifs but what I
08:44 - could actually do is just make all these
08:46 - ifs and everything's actually gonna
08:48 - operate the same and the reason that's
08:49 - going to happen is because well
08:51 - you know in theory none of these
08:53 - conditions will be true at the same time
08:55 - right the tax can never be equal to
08:57 - green blue and red at the same time but
08:59 - the reason we might not want to do this
09:01 - in some instances is well like if it's
09:04 - red what's the point of checking if it's
09:06 - green right so in this case we have
09:08 - three if statements these are gonna
09:09 - happen and they're all gonna be checked
09:11 - every single in of these if statements
09:12 - every time we run this condition will be
09:14 - evaluated and we'll check if this needs
09:16 - to happen but the thing is if the
09:19 - statement is red like if we check the
09:21 - text and it's red what's the point of
09:22 - even bothering to check these other two
09:24 - if statements well that's what we put
09:26 - them in else and because we're saying
09:28 - well you know if it's red there's no
09:30 - chance that this condition will be true
09:31 - so there's no point in even trying to
09:33 - evaluate it right but you know we can do
09:35 - 3-up ifs like this I'll show you this
09:37 - works if i refresh and I go green that's
09:40 - fine and the way this is gonna work is
09:42 - you know we read this if statement we
09:43 - check it if it's true we do it then we
09:46 - read this if statement if it's true we
09:48 - do it like in theory we could make these
09:50 - true like I can make this statement true
09:53 - and now let me actually show you how
09:55 - this works if I type in let's say here
09:58 - so let's have a look at our code we have
09:59 - red true blue right so if I type red
10:02 - notice that we actually change to the
10:05 - color green now the reason that happened
10:07 - is because this is true right so this is
10:09 - always gonna run so we check this even
10:11 - though it actually changes this to red
10:13 - it gets changed to blue directly after
10:15 - but now watch what happens if I type
10:18 - blue well blue is actually run well why
10:21 - is that because this happens we change
10:23 - it to green and then we change it to
10:25 - blue afterwards so we get to see the
10:26 - blue so anyways that has been if else if
10:29 - and else I hope that makes sense as
10:31 - always if there's any questions leave
10:32 - them down below and with that being said
