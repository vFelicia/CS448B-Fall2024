00:00 - hey guys and welcome to the first Python
00:02 - Kibby tutorial so in today's video and I
00:05 - guess the rest of the videos in the
00:06 - series really going through using the
00:08 - Python module Kibby now if you're not
00:10 - sure and you don't know what that is
00:12 - essentially Kibby is a cross-platform
00:14 - compatible GUI development kit and I
00:17 - know that was kind of like a long
00:18 - definition but essentially it allows us
00:20 - to you create graphical user interfaces
00:23 - that work on not only Windows but Mac
00:25 - Linux iOS and Android so that means that
00:29 - all of our applications are scalable for
00:31 - all those platforms and we have to do
00:33 - very minimal when we're
00:34 - what-do-you-call-it
00:35 - releasing for different platforms which
00:37 - is really nice and allows us to develop
00:39 - super-scared scalable applications that
00:42 - we can use on basically everything and
00:43 - for you those of you guys that want to
00:45 - create like apps and stuff like for your
00:47 - phone you can do it with this using
00:49 - Python so we have to install Kibby
00:52 - before we can start using it so
00:53 - essentially I'm just on a kivi website
00:55 - right now and we can do this using pip
00:57 - pretty standard I'm gonna show you how
00:59 - to do it on Windows but if you want to
01:01 - do this on Mac or you wanna do it on
01:02 - some other platform if you go to the
01:04 - kitty website and I'll leave the link in
01:05 - description you go to installation and
01:07 - then you actually this is probably not
01:10 - the best one to do so let's just go to
01:12 - kitty org okay go to download and then
01:16 - just choose your your operating system
01:18 - you can see the Raspberry Pi Android
01:20 - like they have all this kind of stuff
01:22 - OS X Windows probably the most popular
01:24 - I'm gonna go installation on Windows and
01:26 - then I'm actually just gonna copy these
01:27 - commands to install Kibby so what I'm
01:30 - gonna do is I'm gonna go to command
01:31 - prompt now what I need you guys to first
01:34 - off start by typing and see if this
01:36 - works is just type pip on whatever
01:37 - system whatever OS you're working on so
01:40 - a type pip now if this doesn't work for
01:43 - you or you get like pip is not a command
01:45 - watch this really quickly if it did
01:47 - you're you're great just fast forward
01:49 - like a minute into the video and I'll
01:50 - show you what we're gonna do with this
01:51 - so if this didn't work for you what you
01:53 - need to do is you need to go to just
01:55 - type uninstall on in stall like add or
01:59 - remove programs alright and then we're
02:01 - gonna go down here and we're gonna find
02:02 - Python okay so wherever Python is I'm
02:05 - assuming you already have it installed
02:06 - as a Python three point seven point one
02:08 - this is the version I'm using currently
02:10 - supported by Kibby you go to modify get
02:12 - a click yes
02:13 - and then you're gonna go and you're
02:15 - gonna click on modify here and you're
02:18 - gonna just select pip so it should be
02:20 - unselected you're gonna select that and
02:21 - hit next now once you do that it's going
02:24 - to install pip and add it to your path
02:26 - which means you'll be able to do the
02:28 - next steps that I'm about to show so
02:29 - I've already done that so I'm gonna
02:30 - cancel that but that's how you can just
02:32 - quickly allow make pip work on your
02:33 - system ok so now we have pip we're going
02:36 - to do is we're gonna follow the steps on
02:38 - the website so the first one is ensure
02:39 - you have the latest Pip and wheel so I'm
02:41 - literally just gonna copy this command
02:42 - and what do you call it and just type it
02:45 - in here so python - m pip install if for
02:48 - some reason this python - m doesn't work
02:49 - you can just try pip install and that
02:51 - should work for you so let's run this
02:53 - and see I've already done this so it
02:56 - says requirements already up-to-date but
02:58 - for you guys it's probably an install
02:59 - some things okay the next thing you need
03:00 - to do is install the kivi dependencies
03:02 - so again I'm just gonna copy these and
03:05 - just literally paste them into my
03:07 - command prompt and just see if these
03:09 - work and I'll have all these in the
03:10 - description and also on my website Tech
03:12 - with Tim dawn net so that you guys can
03:14 - go through this so if you'd rather go
03:15 - through like a quick text-based version
03:17 - what you can do is just go to my website
03:19 - and I have the entire tutorial written
03:21 - out as a guide on there
03:22 - so tech with Tim done that if you want
03:23 - to see that okay so again requirement
03:26 - already satisfied but I'm just going
03:27 - through what you guys need to do because
03:28 - this needs to use a bunch of different
03:30 - dependencies to actually work okay so
03:33 - now we're gonna go to this one so python
03:35 - pip and still kv depth angle alright
03:38 - we'll use that requirement already
03:41 - satisfied but again this is what you
03:43 - guys need to go through and we don't
03:45 - need to install this last one here we
03:46 - just need to install
03:48 - Kibby so we'll do pip - em pip install
03:50 - Kitty and again I already have this
03:52 - installed so that should be working now
03:54 - last thing if you guys don't already
03:56 - have PI game installed what you need to
03:58 - do is just type pip install PI game like
04:01 - this okay and now again I already have
04:04 - it installed but it should go through
04:06 - and install these things so if you guys
04:07 - have any issues with this please leave a
04:09 - comment I'll try to help you out but
04:10 - essentially what I've just done here is
04:12 - I've installed all the dependencies for
04:14 - Kibby which means I just went to their
04:16 - website and I just copied these things
04:18 - and again how I got here was I went to
04:20 - cubed org and then I just clicked on the
04:22 - download button went to Windows and then
04:25 - I just copied all these things and paste
04:26 - them
04:26 - command prompt and hit enter so you guys
04:28 - should be able to do that again leave a
04:29 - comment I'll try to help you out if
04:30 - anything is wrong with that okay so now
04:32 - we can close that I guess and we'll
04:35 - actually start to get working here in
04:37 - Kibby so I'm gonna be using PyCharm for
04:41 - my where I write all my code but if you
04:43 - guys are using the standard IDL e which
04:45 - comes with pythons just any basic
04:48 - install all this will work so again if
04:49 - you were working with that you can just
04:51 - go to new file create a new file and
04:52 - just you can type the exact same code
04:54 - nothing to be writing in PyCharm I just
04:56 - like this IDE better and it's easier to
04:59 - use that so I'm gonna use it so the
05:01 - first thing we need to do is going to
05:02 - import Kibby and we're gonna see if this
05:04 - works
05:04 - so essentially I already have a
05:06 - configuration here to run if you don't
05:07 - know how to do that I have some PI trim
05:09 - tutorials that can show you but I'm
05:11 - gonna click run and see if we get any
05:12 - errors so I'll come here and guys if you
05:14 - see this red text is perfectly fine this
05:17 - is just info right more kind of warning
05:19 - stuff if you're doing this that's fine
05:21 - just make sure that this actually runs
05:23 - and you don't get any errors okay so if
05:26 - some text comes out that's fine just
05:27 - make sure it's not error if you're using
05:29 - ideally to test this what you're gonna
05:31 - do is you're just gonna go import Kivi
05:33 - like this now it's not gonna work
05:35 - because I'm doing kind of a different
05:37 - way of doing this but this should work
05:39 - for you guys if you've just done what I
05:41 - showed you okay okay so import Kibby
05:43 - next thing we need to do is actually
05:44 - from Kibby dots APB so app we're gonna
05:48 - import and in this case ring do all
05:50 - capitals app now kitty actually works
05:53 - based on object oriented program now if
05:56 - you guys don't know anything about
05:58 - object oriented programming you don't
06:00 - understand classes inheritance I'm gonna
06:02 - recommend you probably learn that first
06:04 - because a lot of this stuff is gonna
06:05 - have to do with that and if you don't
06:07 - know that it could be a bit confusing so
06:09 - I do up tutorials on my channel going
06:10 - through object oriented programming in
06:13 - Python they're about an hour long and
06:14 - I'll teach you everything you need to
06:16 - know so I'll leave a link to that as
06:18 - well but you guys should definitely
06:19 - learn that if you haven't already so now
06:21 - what we're gonna do is we're gonna
06:22 - create a class I'm gonna call this my
06:24 - app okay it's gonna inherit from app now
06:28 - essentially what this is gonna do is it
06:29 - means we're gonna take all the
06:31 - properties that have already been
06:32 - written for us from Kibby from this app
06:34 - class we're gonna use them inside our
06:36 - class my app now the only thing we need
06:38 - to actually write in this class is
06:39 - to find build okay and then I think self
06:43 - is actually all we need and what all
06:45 - we're gonna do here is we're just gonna
06:46 - return something and that is what we're
06:48 - gonna get to now so what we also have to
06:51 - do now is we have to import like our
06:53 - widgets and our labels and all that from
06:55 - Kibby so these are the things that we're
06:57 - gonna draw on to our screen um the
06:59 - things we're gonna use and they've
07:00 - already been created for us from Kibby
07:02 - but we just need to import them so that
07:04 - we can reference them directly so what
07:05 - we're gonna do is we do from Kitty dot
07:07 - what do you call it label or not dot UI
07:10 - X dot label we're going to import and
07:15 - then with a capital label now you should
07:17 - be seeing a trend here all the file
07:19 - names have all lower cases so whenever
07:20 - we're importing something we're gonna
07:21 - import from UI X which is actually a
07:23 - folder we're gonna input import the
07:25 - label python module and then we're gonna
07:28 - import the class label from that module
07:29 - so that now what we're gonna do inside
07:32 - of this app here is we're just gonna
07:33 - type return label and inside the label
07:36 - it takes a parameter of text and that's
07:39 - gonna be obviously what text our label
07:41 - is so I'm gonna say text equals and I'm
07:44 - here tech with Tim like that okay so we
07:48 - have defined build and return label tech
07:51 - with Tim now the reason that we don't
07:53 - need an initialization here so if you've
07:55 - ever used classes before you'll see that
07:57 - we do it define underscore underscore
07:58 - and it's underscore underscore the
08:00 - reason we don't need that is because by
08:01 - the leaving it out this is gonna default
08:04 - call the constructor of our main app
08:07 - class the one we're inheriting from so
08:09 - essentially we're gonna automatically
08:11 - call the inheritor for this or the
08:12 - constructor for this and then it's going
08:15 - to build our like frame and everything
08:17 - for us and then when we call this build
08:19 - we can actually just create the
08:21 - application so the last thing we need to
08:23 - do to actually see our app and run it if
08:26 - we just have to do this and I'll talk
08:27 - about what just doing it in a second so
08:28 - if underscore underscore name underscore
08:30 - underscore equals equals then under
08:33 - square I think it's this our underscore
08:35 - main underscore underscore what we're
08:37 - gonna do is we're just gonna run our app
08:39 - and the way we do that is we're gonna
08:40 - say my app and then brackets make sure
08:44 - you include those brackets otherwise
08:45 - it's talking to work dot run okay so
08:48 - let's quickly just deconstruct what
08:50 - we've actually done so we've imported
08:52 - the main app
08:53 - now this class from kibby's what allows
08:56 - us to build an actual window it's gonna
08:58 - do all the graphics for us it's gonna do
08:59 - all that really low-level stuff for us
09:01 - and we're just gonna inherit that in our
09:04 - own class my app now that means when we
09:06 - call my app got run notice that we
09:08 - didn't create a run method here we
09:10 - didn't do like define run right the
09:13 - reason that we're able to do this is
09:14 - because inside of this app class that we
09:17 - can't see right now but it does exist
09:19 - there is a run method and that run
09:21 - method what it's gonna do is it's gonna
09:22 - configure all the graphics it's gonna
09:23 - get everything set up and it's going to
09:26 - run our app now when we do build what's
09:29 - gonna happen is this is what is going to
09:32 - like be the main interface for our
09:34 - applications when we're just returning a
09:36 - label somewhere inside of this app class
09:39 - it's it's calling this build method
09:41 - right or it's calling yeah this build
09:42 - method and it's asking for what do we
09:45 - need to put inside the window and it's
09:47 - gonna give a label that says the text
09:49 - Tech with ten so our app class is going
09:52 - to set that up it's gonna draw the label
09:54 - out to the screen and then when we're
09:55 - running this right we're gonna see it on
09:57 - the screen so let's go ahead and run
09:58 - this and see if it's working awesome so
10:01 - we get a window that says tech with Tim
10:03 - now notice right away if I resize this
10:06 - window make it whatever size I want you
10:09 - actually see the caesareans being kind
10:11 - of difficult here that our label
10:14 - automatically adjusts now this is
10:15 - amazing because this means essentially
10:17 - that we can just allow this to go out on
10:21 - any platform right away and it's
10:23 - automatically gonna be sized dynamically
10:25 - to whatever we're on so say we go
10:27 - fullscreen you can see this
10:29 - automatically just goes right in the
10:30 - middle if I go back it goes like that so
10:32 - this is gonna work on all platforms and
10:34 - that's the amazing thing with Kibby that
10:36 - allows us to do that so easily so that
10:39 - is I think all I'm going to do for this
10:42 - tutorial if you have any trouble setting
10:43 - up Kibby please don't hesitate to
10:44 - contact me either in the comments
10:46 - draining my discord server or on Twitter
10:48 - if you guys enjoyed the video please
