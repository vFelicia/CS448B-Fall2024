00:00 - I'm here to tell you that most your
00:01 - programming projects suck the reason for
00:03 - that is they don't demonstrate the
00:05 - skills employers need to see to actually
00:07 - give you a jum the best project you can
00:09 - work on is one that demonstrates you not
00:11 - only know how to code but to architect a
00:14 - solution and a project employers need to
00:16 - see that you have the ability to build
00:18 - something from scratch to plan on your
00:20 - own and to make design decisions even if
00:23 - they're relatively minor this is why I
00:25 - typically recommend building a full
00:26 - stack application you want to build a
00:28 - nice front end a backend connect those
00:30 - with an API have some kind of database
00:32 - and go into the interview ready to
00:34 - explain the different decisions you made
00:37 - why you chose those decisions and how
00:38 - you came up with the basic architecture
00:40 - and data flow of the application if you
00:42 - can do that you're immediately going to
00:44 - stand out and you'll notice in a lot of
00:46 - interviews that's what they're looking
00:47 - for not your coding ability your ability
00:49 - to design and plan now if you want to
00:51 - learn more about exactly how to land a
00:53 - software development position I have a
00:55 - free introduction course that you can
00:56 - sign up for from the link in the pinned
