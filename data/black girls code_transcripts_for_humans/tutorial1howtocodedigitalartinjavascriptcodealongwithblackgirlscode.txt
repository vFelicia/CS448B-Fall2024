00:00 - [Music]
00:00 - what's up beautiful people it's your
00:03 - girl Jillian and I am so excited to
00:05 - welcome you to the code zone I'll be
00:08 - your host for this digital Series code
00:10 - along coding art with meaning in p5js
00:13 - brought to you by black girls code
00:15 - [Music]
00:22 - four part series we will be coding art
00:24 - with a powerful message using a really
00:27 - cool platform called p5.js so welcome to
00:30 - video one now in this series we'll be
00:33 - focusing on creating digital art to
00:35 - share important messages with the world
00:36 - but first let me drop some knowledge
00:39 - black artists have always been at the
00:41 - Forefront of using visual art to spread
00:43 - messages about social justice
00:45 - take a look at this piece by Octavia Inc
00:48 - showcasing everything that black Joy is
00:51 - self-expression creativity Liberation
00:53 - identity Freedom as you can see art is
00:57 - meant to have an impact on us and it can
00:59 - also often have a powerful impact on
01:01 - society maybe I could use my skills to
01:04 - make my own piece of art
01:07 - see what I did there when I created this
01:09 - piece I wanted the viewer to understand
01:11 - that art can be a perfect medium to
01:13 - sharing my message with the world I
01:15 - wanted to show that our art whether you
01:17 - use the power of the pen microphone or
01:20 - paintbrush can truly change the world
01:22 - and I did it all in p5.js I mean it was
01:26 - super fun to make and now I'm going to
01:28 - show you how to do the same let's get
01:30 - into it
01:32 - now first things first let's talk about
01:35 - p5.js p eep.js is a JavaScript tool for
01:38 - Creative coding think of it like an
01:40 - artist's Sketchbook but instead of
01:42 - drawing and painting with physical
01:43 - brushes and paint we are using code to
01:46 - accomplish the same goal we've leveled
01:48 - up from pencils and paper fam we'll
01:50 - start first by creating an account on
01:52 - p5.js
01:53 - that way we can save all of our work and
01:56 - make sure nothing is lost as we go along
01:57 - that would be the worst go to
02:01 - editor.p5js.org click on the sign up
02:04 - link in the top right hand corner of the
02:06 - page
02:07 - take one moment to do that now well not
02:10 - like literally take as long as you need
02:12 - now that you've got your account set up
02:14 - it will bring us to the text editor so a
02:17 - text editor is actually a computer
02:18 - program that allows us to write and edit
02:21 - plain text but in p5.js it's like our
02:24 - sketch pad meaning we'll draw on it with
02:26 - our code on the text editor page you can
02:29 - see the play and stop buttons at the top
02:31 - left of the page these buttons will
02:33 - start stop and update our drawings the
02:36 - best option is to select the auto
02:38 - refresh next to the stop button this
02:40 - will allow us to see the changes we make
02:42 - to our canvas immediately
02:44 - now below these buttons is where the
02:46 - text editor sketch is located and to the
02:49 - right of our text editor is where we
02:51 - will see the preview of the drawing we
02:53 - are creating
02:54 - okay so now that we know how to create
02:56 - an account and use and view the text
02:58 - editor let's dive in and start making
03:00 - some art and like any good artist before
03:03 - we break the rules we first have to
03:06 - learn them
03:07 - the basis of all art usually involves
03:09 - lines shapes and colors so in today's
03:12 - video we will focus on learning how to
03:13 - create those in p5.js but first we'll
03:17 - learn how to add shapes inside the draw
03:18 - function the first thing we will do is
03:21 - change the background color to Pink
03:23 - then let's add a circle to the canvas
03:25 - we'll do this by adding our shapes
03:28 - inside the draw function
03:30 - an ellipse represents a circle or oval
03:33 - you can set and change the size of the
03:35 - ellipse the first number or argument
03:37 - represents the x-coordinate second is
03:40 - the y-coordinate third is the width and
03:43 - fourth is the height of the ellipse
03:46 - and there we have it a pink donut
03:49 - oh I mean a pink circle sorry I was
03:52 - definitely thinking with my stomach okay
03:55 - so now we have a circle in the middle of
03:57 - our canvas it's currently white with a
03:59 - black border but I want to change the
04:01 - color of the circle to my favorite color
04:03 - gold
04:06 - oh yes see now I know you're thinking
04:09 - I'm a little extra but it's not my fault
04:11 - it looks good on me
04:13 - to change the color I will use fill and
04:16 - all I have to do is type in what color I
04:18 - want
04:20 - but wait our Circle went away
04:23 - it looks like we have an error don't
04:25 - stress that we can solve any problem if
04:27 - we just think it through now when I look
04:30 - closely at the code I see that gold is
04:32 - spelled correctly but my circle
04:34 - background isn't gold that's weird so
04:38 - I'm feeling like this is going to be one
04:39 - of those times where we should work
04:41 - smarter and not harder okay you know
04:44 - what this isn't a test so why don't we
04:46 - look at our cheat sheets
04:48 - okay so it says here that we need to put
04:51 - quotations around gold so that Phil can
04:54 - understand what color we want just like
04:56 - when we change the background to Pink if
04:58 - you remember pink had quotations around
05:00 - it
05:03 - awesome and we fixed it told you that
05:06 - you got this so now that we have a gold
05:08 - circle with a black Border in the middle
05:10 - of the canvas why don't we add another
05:13 - circle to the left side of our gold
05:14 - Circle
05:16 - let's copy and fill an ellipse then
05:18 - paste the copy below
05:20 - and I'm going to change the color of the
05:22 - second Circle to White
05:24 - okay so I want to move the second circle
05:27 - to the left of the gold Circle the way
05:29 - to do this is by subtracting from our x
05:31 - coordinate or the horizontal coordinate
05:34 - think about it like this subtraction
05:36 - allows us to move to the left and
05:38 - addition helps us move to the right if I
05:40 - subtract 100 then the second Circle will
05:43 - move to the left to the left by
05:45 - precisely 100 and now we'll try to
05:49 - change this circle to an oval and make
05:51 - it look smaller than the first Circle we
05:53 - can try adjusting the width to 75 and
05:56 - height to 50.
05:57 - I also don't really want a black border
06:00 - around the oval so I'll use no stroke to
06:02 - remove the Border
06:04 - and listen I'm not here to stroke
06:06 - anyone's ego but you are really doing
06:09 - great
06:10 - now we have two shapes one medium-sized
06:13 - gold Circle in the middle of the canvas
06:15 - and a smaller white oval to the left
06:17 - side of the circle
06:19 - but wait
06:20 - something happened when we added no
06:22 - border for the oval
06:24 - no stroke took away the border for the
06:26 - first gold Circle as well
06:28 - how well by default if you draw a shape
06:32 - then it will have a black border so when
06:34 - we added no border to the oval draw
06:36 - applied it to all the shapes and made it
06:38 - so that none of them have borders if we
06:41 - want to add a border back to the gold
06:43 - Circle then we will have to specify how
06:45 - thick we want the border to be border
06:48 - thickness is written as stroke weight
06:50 - the numbers range from 1 to the width of
06:52 - your canvas each number represents one
06:55 - line width on your canvas for example
06:57 - our canvas is 400 by 400 so that means
07:00 - we have 400 lines going from left to
07:03 - right and 400 lines going from top to
07:06 - bottom if we increase the thickness by
07:08 - one or two then we are adding individual
07:11 - lines together so let's make the stroke
07:13 - weight equal four this will be the same
07:16 - as four lines added together
07:18 - stroke tells the shape what color border
07:21 - you want I think I'm going to choose
07:23 - gold cousin the color yellow of course
07:25 - as the Border this time let's add our
07:27 - border to the gold Circle and change the
07:29 - color with stroke
07:31 - [Music]
07:35 - why don't we try adding two more ovals
07:37 - one to the right and one beneath the
07:40 - gold Circle
07:41 - we now have four shapes on our canvas
07:43 - three ovals and one Circle
07:52 - circles and ovals of the canvas as you
07:54 - like seriously guys go nuts really
07:58 - there's no such thing as too many of
08:00 - these guys
08:02 - okay maybe I went a little overboard
08:04 - next up it's a pyramid it's a mountain
08:08 - no wait
08:10 - angle
08:12 - now that we've mastered ovals and
08:14 - circles why don't we try adding a
08:17 - triangle to the top of our gold Circle
08:19 - and color it yellow we'll also give it a
08:22 - gold border with a thickness of three I
08:24 - want the first point of my triangle to
08:26 - be in the middle of my circle the second
08:28 - and third points will be below the first
08:31 - point just above the circle and they
08:33 - will be the same width as the circle
08:35 - look at that I guess I wasn't so obtuse
08:39 - after all
08:41 - okay okay that was my first and last
08:43 - triangle joke now pinky swear
08:45 - [Music]
08:46 - now you try adding more triangles to the
08:49 - canvas but don't go crazy remember what
08:51 - happened last time
08:52 - scary
08:54 - now that we have mastered triangles and
08:56 - ellipses let's add some rectangles as we
08:59 - all know rectangles have four sides they
09:02 - can be short and wide or slim and tall
09:05 - why don't we add a wide and short green
09:07 - rectangle below my circle on the right
09:10 - side
09:11 - drawing a rectangle is similar to an
09:13 - ellipse because you set the X and Y
09:15 - coordinates first then set the width and
09:17 - height
09:19 - awesome we have a light green rectangle
09:22 - on our canvas
09:23 - but it's not looking the way I want it
09:25 - to look yet I thought the rectangle
09:28 - would be behind the oval but it's legit
09:30 - trying to upstage the oval
09:32 - but thankfully it's simple to fix draw
09:35 - is Red from top to bottom so whatever
09:37 - you draw at the top will be drawn first
09:39 - and whatever is drawn next will go on
09:41 - top of it in real life if you paint on
09:44 - or over something already drawn the new
09:46 - object will cover the old object and
09:48 - it's the same for our digital canvas if
09:50 - we draw a rectangle that is in the
09:52 - background we will have to move it
09:53 - towards the top of our text editor so
09:55 - that all the other shapes are drawn on
09:57 - top of it
09:58 - and draw let's find the area where I am
10:00 - on top of the pink background but not on
10:02 - top of any other shapes here's the spot
10:06 - now let's add a tall purple rectangle
10:08 - with no border to the left side of the
10:10 - canvas
10:12 - yes and you did the thing two different
10:15 - rectangles in two different places on
10:17 - the canvas one in the background and one
10:19 - other in the foreground now go ahead and
10:22 - practice adding other shapes to your
10:23 - canvas
10:24 - alright we're done learning how to code
10:27 - today but there's still one very
10:29 - important lesson left and that is the
10:30 - lesson of saving your work because
10:32 - there's literally nothing absolutely
10:34 - nothing worse than losing all of your
10:36 - hard work trust me I've been there
10:39 - so with that said let's go ahead and
10:42 - save our artwork we'll go to file at the
10:45 - top left side of the page and select
10:47 - save
10:48 - you can also share your artwork by going
10:50 - to file then clicking share
10:54 - real talk you absolutely slayed we
10:57 - learned so much about how artists use
10:59 - their work to spread important messages
11:01 - how to use p5js to draw in color shapes
11:04 - and while I know we didn't create a
11:06 - masterpiece here but listen Rome wasn't
11:09 - built in a day and Rihanna's music slash
11:11 - fashion slash Beauty slash charity
11:14 - Empire wasn't built overnight either
11:15 - okay so as badgal Riri would probably
11:18 - want me to tell you be patient with
11:21 - yourself I promise we'll make something
11:23 - Museum worthy once we finish learning
11:25 - the basics that's all for now thanks for
11:27 - watching and learning with me today
11:29 - until next time stay cute and stay
11:32 - coding
11:36 - foreign
11:40 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

what's up beautiful people it's your girl Jillian and I am so excited to welcome you to the code zone I'll be your host for this digital Series code along coding art with meaning in p5js brought to you by black girls code four part series we will be coding art with a powerful message using a really cool platform called p5.js so welcome to video one now in this series we'll be focusing on

link in the top right hand corner of the page take one moment to do that now well not like literally take as long as you need now that you've got your account set up it will bring us to the text
