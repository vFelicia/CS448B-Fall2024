00:03 - [Music]
00:07 - work of our next guest across social
00:10 - media and I can't wait to introduce her
00:12 - Danielle Koch is an illustrator and
00:15 - activist during the height of the
00:17 - pandemic her art provoked much needed
00:19 - conversations around equal rights and
00:21 - justice for black people in America she
00:24 - has not only impacted the world through
00:26 - her work but also launched her own
00:28 - collection at Target I mean she is
00:31 - complete gold
00:34 - so Danny thank you so much for coming by
00:36 - of course thank you for having me of
00:38 - course and welcome to the code Zone oh
00:39 - yeah it looks so good in here I know
00:41 - it's so cute so yeah so today we're
00:44 - gonna be uh getting to play Jenga to get
00:46 - to know you better so basically each of
00:49 - us will remove one block and place it at
00:51 - the top of the tower without making it
00:52 - collapse and if it collapses then that
00:54 - round of the game is over and then
00:56 - another one begins so as you can see the
00:59 - tower has four different colors each
01:01 - color represents a theme when you pull a
01:03 - specific colored block you will have to
01:05 - answer a question from that color themes
01:07 - the color themes include purple for
01:09 - childhood memories red for career green
01:12 - for inspiration and blue for a challenge
01:14 - sounds pretty easy right sounds good to
01:16 - me okay so are you ready to get started
01:18 - let's do it here I go
01:20 - huh
01:22 - I know the first one's always like kind
01:25 - of tough
01:26 - there we go good one
01:28 - okay and then when you're done you can
01:31 - put out the top oh my gosh not me
01:33 - forgetting no that's okay okay so
01:36 - inspiration to start us off so what's
01:39 - your design process our storyboards
01:42 - involved most people might start out
01:43 - with storyboards but I start out with
01:45 - writing because my art is very content
01:48 - heavy sometimes very information heavy I
01:50 - deal with topics like justice and race I
01:52 - do a lot of research ahead of time but
01:54 - then I also enjoy writing my thoughts
01:56 - out and so I'll write them out after
01:58 - researching and then I'll split it maybe
02:00 - into four steps or three ways or two
02:03 - takeaways something tangible and
02:06 - digestible and then I will draw based on
02:08 - that information let's do what's to some
02:11 - career questions we haven't gotten to
02:12 - Korea yet okay
02:14 - um I don't know this is risky to pick
02:16 - all the way at the bottom but we'll see
02:18 - okay
02:19 - [Music]
02:20 - so our next question so tell us what you
02:23 - do as an artist give us a glimpse of
02:25 - your day-to-day I like to give myself
02:27 - maybe like an hour or two to just do
02:30 - some dreaming and getting ideas down on
02:33 - paper because I realized the faster I go
02:35 - the less time I dedicate to dreaming and
02:37 - coming up with creative new ideas which
02:40 - is so important to the process and then
02:42 - I read reading for me is very very
02:46 - important to the work I read a lot for
02:48 - fun when I was younger but now I'm
02:50 - reading to like take in information so
02:52 - I'm like reading a testament of Hope by
02:54 - Dr King and I'm reading a collection of
02:56 - poems by Maya Angelou like things that
02:58 - can feed into the heart behind the art
03:01 - I'm going to do another challenge okay
03:04 - blue up here I go again I don't know
03:07 - what it is like I don't even like look
03:09 - around that long I just like take it out
03:11 - you're killing it
03:13 - okay so tell us a challenge that you've
03:17 - dealt with as an artist and how you
03:19 - overcame it a challenge for me as an
03:22 - artist that does the kind of art that I
03:23 - do was making enough space to grieve and
03:26 - hold space for the real processing that
03:29 - comes with these really
03:31 - horrible tragedies while then also
03:34 - translating it for people to digest and
03:37 - understand it I think another difficulty
03:39 - that a lot of people can probably relate
03:40 - to would be
03:43 - feeling whether I'm worthy of the title
03:46 - of an artist but at first I was like I'm
03:48 - an imposter this is an art yeah yeah I
03:52 - think a lot of artists go through that
03:53 - phase though right you're killing it so
03:55 - thank you of course so sweet
03:58 - okay I think it's your turn me again
04:00 - okay I think I know where I'm going this
04:02 - time
04:03 - oh
04:05 - yeah and you see when like some pops out
04:08 - when it moves that's the one you gotta
04:10 - get
04:11 - oh see look at that I didn't realize I
04:14 - was this good at Jacob I thought it was
04:16 - over or maybe I'm just like really
04:18 - average I don't know okay career
04:21 - what is your favorite piece of art sold
04:23 - or created and why okay I love this
04:26 - question so there are some pieces that
04:29 - are super popular that I probably
04:30 - wouldn't consider my absolute favorite
04:31 - but there is one it's called the good
04:34 - work poem and so it started out as just
04:37 - me writing this encouragement to people
04:38 - who were in the thick of fighting for
04:41 - justice and it basically says like you
04:43 - were created to do good work and this
04:45 - work is hard you know it's meant to
04:47 - change things it's meant to destroy
04:50 - certain things and it's meant to soften
04:52 - Hearts like that kind of work is
04:53 - difficult but it's also good that's
04:55 - probably one of my favorite pieces okay
04:58 - uh I think it's my turn so let's see
05:01 - this one looks loose oh yeah should I do
05:04 - okay
05:07 - last challenge question
05:09 - okay what is one thing you want to tell
05:11 - us but we haven't asked you yet one
05:14 - thing that I used to always say is that
05:16 - Perfection is not a prerequisite to
05:17 - participation just show up authentically
05:20 - and be honest be factual but also be
05:24 - true to yourself be true to your style
05:25 - and you don't have to be perfect to get
05:26 - going I don't know about this one oh you
05:29 - got it oh that's it oh wow I'm I don't
05:32 - know I don't know what it is like I
05:34 - really don't know what it is okay
05:35 - perfect another career question so how
05:38 - do you make your art profitable I
05:41 - started producing art prints and then I
05:44 - converted things to stickers and
05:46 - bookmarks notepads and so I created a
05:48 - whole collection of products around the
05:50 - artwork that I had made and that was
05:52 - successful well I think that's all
05:54 - that's all for us today thank you so
05:55 - much for coming by I literally I learned
05:57 - so much about you it was lovely talking
05:59 - to you and thank you again thank you for
06:02 - having me this was so fun all right
