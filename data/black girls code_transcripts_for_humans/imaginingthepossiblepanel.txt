00:10 - conversation
00:11 - about the power of imagination and the
00:13 - magic of stem
00:14 - with the filmmakers behind jingle jangle
00:16 - a christmas journey
00:18 - the new holiday film from netflix david
00:20 - i'm going to start with you can you
00:22 - talk to us about how the idea for jingle
00:24 - jangle
00:25 - came to life when did your vision first
00:27 - appear 22 years ago uh
00:30 - started writing this and um because i
00:33 - grew up on
00:33 - all of the uh um big holi big holiday
00:37 - classics big
00:38 - fantasy classics and uh and
00:41 - i was getting um i didn't want to grow
00:43 - up really
00:44 - i wanted to stay because who wants to
00:47 - grow up what is there
00:48 - that right so i invented this guy
00:52 - right here that was the first that was
00:54 - the first one in buddy
00:56 - uh buddy 3000 and um
00:59 - and then it kind of evolved we kept we
01:01 - were going to do it as a broadway
01:02 - musical
01:04 - and then when our son was born then when
01:06 - our son was born elias
01:08 - i started seeing life through the eyes
01:11 - of a child again
01:12 - and it awakened my inner child and my
01:15 - wonder and my imagination
01:17 - and and everything was just like a burst
01:20 - of
01:20 - of of everything and that's when i said
01:24 - it was time to to
01:25 - really bring this to light and lim said
01:27 - why don't we do it as a movie instead
01:29 - of uh play and i went to netflix
01:33 - and told them and here we are lynn
01:36 - you're the producer
01:37 - and you supervise every detail of jingle
01:40 - jangle
01:40 - can you tell us what were the most
01:42 - challenging and how you basically coded
01:44 - the
01:44 - impossible to ensure that these things
01:46 - came to life
01:47 - um i would say
01:51 - that the most challenging was kind of
01:55 - keeping myself together because
01:58 - you know i always felt like you know
02:01 - we'll figure it out we can figure it out
02:02 - and you push through to figure out
02:04 - but it's how are you moving through it
02:06 - you know it can be very stressful
02:08 - it's a lot of responsibility and you
02:11 - want to make sure that you get it right
02:12 - and that's what matters you know there
02:14 - was nothing about this that was easy at
02:16 - all but it was rewarding and it was
02:19 - fulfilling
02:20 - and that's what mattered so that
02:23 - code that whole formula of square root
02:26 - of possible that was my mantra
02:27 - throughout
02:28 - and that is what i was using all along
02:31 - to
02:32 - push through all of the barriers to get
02:34 - to where we are now
02:35 - brad let's talk visual effects i heard
02:38 - you actually brought a clip for us
02:40 - to kind of demonstrate how you brought
02:42 - these things to life
02:44 - i i did so what you're seeing is uh don
02:47 - juan coming to life
02:48 - and there are little pictures in picture
02:50 - there and you can see that the animation
02:52 - team
02:53 - is um actually referencing the movements
02:56 - that they're going to do for don juan
02:58 - so through a series of tools and
03:01 - techniques that
03:02 - incorporate lots of science and
03:04 - technology
03:05 - and engineering and coding um we're able
03:08 - to
03:08 - translate the movements of the animators
03:11 - moving
03:12 - to making don juan dance if you guys
03:14 - ever need like another dancing model
03:16 - i've got some sweet moves for you so i'm
03:18 - just gonna volunteer that
03:21 - lin you really created an entire world
03:24 - out of out of your imagination
03:26 - and that's exactly what we tell our
03:28 - girls all the time is that they
03:29 - literally can create
03:30 - their own worlds and today we have our
03:34 - girls in the room our black girls code
03:36 - ambassadors
03:36 - and they have some questions for y'all
03:38 - is there a character in jingle jingle
03:40 - that you most relate to
03:42 - or learn something from i would say
03:44 - journey because she's like i'm gonna
03:46 - make it happen
03:48 - come hella high water i'm gonna push
03:50 - through and i'm gonna have a great
03:51 - attitude about it you know i'm gonna
03:53 - come out
03:54 - with a smile i'm gonna put my heart you
03:57 - know on my sleeve
03:58 - and if i get hurt it's okay but i i'm
04:01 - gonna keep going
04:02 - we happened to notice that there was a
04:04 - wakanda sticker on jeronicus's luggage
04:06 - it was so cool to see that tribute and
04:08 - shout out to black panther
04:10 - are there any other hidden gems that we
04:12 - might have missed maybe buddy's made out
04:13 - of vibranium i don't know maybe that's
04:15 - what's helpful
04:17 - but another easter egg is on the buddy
04:20 - buddy 3000
04:22 - around his eyes my son's name
04:26 - elias around his eyes it says elias 260.
04:30 - and elias is my son's name our son's
04:33 - name
04:34 - and 260 is the address of my
04:36 - great-grandmother
04:37 - so i wanted to have this this connection
04:41 - of this magic flowing the real life
04:44 - magic of me
04:45 - flowing through the magic of buddy
04:48 - how would you tell young creators
04:51 - to continue to follow their imagination
04:54 - while working
04:55 - well i think the important thing is is
04:57 - to follow your imagination and not give
04:59 - up
04:59 - i i'd say one of the one of the big
05:00 - things that keeps any of us from
05:03 - uh realizing our dreams is giving up
05:05 - before we start
05:06 - um things can seem impossible like they
05:08 - did for journey
05:10 - but she figured things out right and i
05:12 - think we can all do that too so
05:14 - i think it's so easy to um to just
05:17 - feel like second guess yourself and feel
05:19 - like you know what
05:20 - i don't know enough yet or i'm not good
05:22 - enough to do this or
05:24 - i don't have the resources to do this
05:26 - well if you do a little bit of digging
05:28 - um you might be able to find the
05:30 - resources and you might be able to
05:32 - begin that journey of creating whatever
05:35 - it is that you're imagining
05:36 - talk about imagination oh my gosh i went
05:39 - and showed uh a early little sketch of
05:42 - buddy to my son
05:44 - and he went back and and came back and
05:48 - showed me this
05:50 - this was his drawing of the buddy 3 000.
05:53 - oh my gosh
05:54 - the original the original original buddy
05:56 - nobody
05:57 - yeah yeah the blueprint for buddy
06:02 - yeah yeah so you know it's just that's
06:06 - the beauty of imagination
06:08 - and for me to be able to lend it out to
06:11 - be able to work on this film when our
06:12 - son was five when we started and just
06:14 - awaken his imagination
06:16 - and if your imagination is
06:20 - is being sparked at this age my god
06:23 - uh my god world look out
06:27 - exactly right so thank you for taking
06:29 - something from your imagination from
06:31 - 20 plus years ago and bringing it to
06:34 - life exactly when the world needed it
06:36 - most
06:36 - of course be sure to watch jingle jangle
