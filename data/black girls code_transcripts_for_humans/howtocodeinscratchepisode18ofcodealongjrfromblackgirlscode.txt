03:11 - areas on the screen on the left side
03:13 - you'll see your blocks palette this is
03:16 - kind of like your toy box full of
03:18 - different kinds of coding blocks each
03:20 - type of block can do something different
03:22 - some blocks can move your Sprites some
03:24 - can make them talk and some can even
03:26 - make them think you can drag and drop
03:29 - your blocks from the toy box to your
03:31 - scripts
03:32 - area the blocks snap together like
03:35 - puzzle pieces or like those digital
03:37 - Legos I talked about earlier click on

04:16 - [Music]
04:19 - below did you see the cat move if not
04:22 - then press it again and again awesome
04:26 - look at him go the character on the
04:28 - right is called a Sprite these are your
04:32 - actors they can be anything a cat a
04:35 - person a car a tree or even a shap you
04:40 - can pick any Sprite you like or even
04:42 - draw your
04:43 - own the area that the Sprite is moving
04:45 - in is called the stage think of it like
04:48 - a theater stage this is where your ideas
04:51 - come together and the Sprites perform
04:53 - the actions from the blocks you create
04:56 - not a cat person no problem let's change
04:59 - your Sprite go to the bottom of the page
05:02 - and click on the purple icon that looks
05:04 - like a
05:05 - cat you'll see options to choose a
05:07 - Sprite paint your own Sprite if you're
05:09 - creative and be surprised by a random
05:12 - Sprite or upload your own Sprite click
05:15 - on choose a
05:16 - Sprite now you should see a page with a
05:19 - lot of options you can search for a
05:22 - Sprite name or choose a category I'm
05:24 - going to click on the people tabs and
05:26 - choose a ballerina to represent me
05:28 - dancing on stage
05:32 - now we have a ballerina and a cat to
05:34 - switch between the characters look below
05:36 - the stage and select which one you want
05:38 - to add blocks to each new Sprite will
05:41 - have a blank play area it's up to you to
05:44 - add code and actions you can copy and
05:47 - paste blocks from one play area to the
05:49 - next or you can drag and drop them into
05:51 - the Sprite area below the stage I'm
05:54 - going to delete the C for now and leave
05:56 - the
05:58 - ballerina
06:00 - did you notice that every time you press
06:02 - the space bar the character moves and
06:05 - the numbers in the area labeled X go up
06:07 - by 10 the X represents the x axis that's
06:11 - anything moving from left to right the
06:14 - box next to it represents the Y AIS
06:16 - moving from top to bottom when both
06:19 - boxes are set to zero your Sprite will
06:21 - be in the center of the
06:23 - stage to the left of the X and Y AIS
06:26 - boxes you can also change the name of
06:28 - your Sprite
06:30 - let's change the name from ballerina to
06:32 - your
06:36 - name below the Sprite name is the area
06:39 - where you can make the Sprite visible or
06:41 - invisible click the ey on the left to
06:43 - show the Sprite or the one on the right
06:45 - to make it
06:47 - invisible you can also change the size
06:50 - of your Sprite to make it bigger or
06:51 - smaller by changing the values inside
06:53 - the size input below your stage to
06:56 - change the direction your Sprite is
06:58 - facing on the stage click the number in
07:00 - the middle to show a circle with a
07:02 - purple Arrow the circle represents
07:05 - 360° and the arrow tells you which
07:08 - direction your Sprite is facing grab the
07:11 - arrow and move it around the
07:14 - [Music]
07:22 - circle now I'm going to change my coat a
07:24 - bit and add more actions From the Block
07:26 - palette notice that the Blue Block has
07:29 - the number 10 inside a white circle you
07:32 - can select and change the value inside
07:34 - any white circle I'm going to click on
07:36 - 10 and change it to
07:39 - 15 the Yellow Block also has a drop-down
07:42 - menu which allows you to change which
07:44 - key you want to use to start the action
07:46 - you can click space then select right
07:49 - arrow so now every time we press the
07:52 - right arrow our character will move 15
07:54 - Steps to the
07:56 - right but what if I want to make my
07:58 - Sprite do more than move to the right
08:00 - that's easy I'm going to make a copy of
08:03 - my block so I can change or add to them
08:05 - right click on a block and select
08:09 - duplicate when you move your mouse
08:11 - you'll see a duplicate of your current
08:13 - block go to another place in the scripts
08:16 - area and drop your new
08:18 - [Music]
08:20 - block now I want the Sprite to move
08:23 - backwards so I'm going to change the
08:25 - right arrow to left arrow and add a
08:27 - negative sign to 10
08:30 - wait a negative sign to 10 yes when you
08:34 - add a negative sign to the number the
08:36 - direction is reversed so if 10 makes
08:39 - your Sprite go 10 steps to the right -
08:41 - 10 makes your Sprite go 10 steps to the
08:47 - left next I want my ballerina to talk
08:50 - she's supposed to be just like me after
08:52 - all and you should know by now that I
08:54 - love to
08:56 - talk to make my ballerina talk I I need
08:59 - to go to the looks tab I'm going to go
09:02 - to the looks tab on the Block palette
09:04 - and adding the say hello block under the
09:07 - move 15 Steps block look blocks
09:10 - determine how the Sprite will look and
09:12 - what it can say or think I'm going to go
09:16 - back to the first block and snap in the
09:18 - think h under the move -1 steps block
09:23 - remember the blocks read from top to
09:25 - bottom so the order you put them in
09:27 - makes a big difference now test out the
09:31 - code press the right arrow to go forward
09:34 - and the back arrow to go backwards the
09:37 - ballerina is now walking talking and
09:40 - thinking oh my gosh so cool now let's
09:44 - take a look at our stage right now it's
09:47 - pretty basic let's change it go to the
09:50 - bottom right corner and click on the
09:52 - purple button with the picture and
09:54 - select choose
09:55 - backdrop there's so many options I'm
09:58 - going to choose a concert
10:03 - backdrop now I'm going to make the
10:05 - ballerina Glide all over the stage with
10:08 - the following
10:10 - code to test it I'll click on the green
10:14 - flag then click on the stage where I
10:16 - want the ballerina to
10:18 - go awesome now we have a moving talking
10:23 - thinking ballerina performing on an
10:25 - amazing stage we don't want to lose all
10:28 - of our hard work do we I'm going to save
10:30 - my progress save yours too click the
10:34 - save Now button in the top right corner
10:37 - or we can go to file then select save
10:40 - now we've learned so much today about
10:42 - what it takes to create a scratch
10:44 - project I don't know about you but I
10:46 - think I might need a little brain break
10:49 - make sure you practice what we worked on
10:51 - today if you want a closer look at my
10:53 - code be sure to click the project link
10:55 - below I can't wait for you to join me
10:57 - for the next episode of cold along along
11:00 - see you
