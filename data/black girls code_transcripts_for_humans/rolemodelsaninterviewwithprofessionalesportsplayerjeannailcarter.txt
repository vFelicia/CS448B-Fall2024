02:01 - that you go into all right tell us about
02:04 - being the first black female player to
02:07 - join the Red Bull team it's exciting and
02:10 - in the sense that I'm making history
02:12 - it's something I didn't think about when
02:15 - it happened I was just so proud to be
02:17 - recognized for my skill
02:19 - but I'm so proud that means that I'm a
02:23 - part of the progress and the history
02:24 - being made
02:25 - and uh I worked super hard to get here
02:27 - and I'm glad that um I could be a proud

02:51 - personally I had a lot of guidance and
02:54 - help along the way to shape my brand and
02:59 - become the player I want to be so I'll
03:01 - speak specifically about my manager
03:03 - Emily Tran she picked me as a player for
03:06 - her team Equinox gaming in 2018. I just
03:09 - graduated college and um the last four
03:11 - years she's taught me about being a
03:14 - businesswoman negotiating for myself
03:16 - never taking less than always knowing
03:19 - what I'm worth having resources to help
03:22 - me become a better player which meant
03:23 - hiring a coach for me and um advocating
03:26 - for myself
03:28 - Emily has mentored me for quite some
03:30 - time and without that mentorship I would
03:34 - not have understood what brand Building
03:35 - looks like or what uh knowing my worth
03:38 - was was like that's beautiful that you
03:41 - can learn from another woman how to know
03:43 - your worth in the industry so what's
03:46 - some advice you would give young girls
03:48 - who are interested in being a gamer find
03:51 - communities of people and women like you
03:54 - that you can bond with through playing
03:56 - these games because when you find them
03:58 - then you all enjoy the same game there's
04:00 - sometimes a lot of other things that you
04:01 - enjoy too outside of the game
04:04 - being a part of a community can make
04:07 - gaming or entering into that world less
04:08 - daunting all right guys you hear that
04:11 - there is a lot of different ways you can
04:12 - get involved in the gaming world thank
04:13 - you for that alrighty this one's a fun
04:16 - one ready list as many female game
04:19 - characters as possible you have 10
04:21 - seconds ready okay let's start right now
04:22 - go okay uh Lara Croft nariko uh Vicki
04:27 - Green
04:29 - uh
04:40 - it's not fighting game once great job
04:42 - great job that was awesome alrighty give
04:45 - us five tips inspiring entrepreneurs
04:48 - should know okay so five tips I think
04:50 - Gamers and entrepreneurs should know is
04:52 - uh What uh being on different forms of
04:56 - social media is very important exposure
04:58 - discoverability it doesn't just happen
04:59 - on one platform it happens across many
05:01 - uh two uh having the LinkedIn is very
05:05 - very important
05:06 - it helps with reach you get to connect
05:10 - with a lot of Professionals in your
05:12 - industry that way three study the people
05:14 - who are doing what you want to do I know
05:17 - people sometimes reference that as like
05:18 - shadowing or like maybe you study them
05:21 - more like you work beside them or maybe
05:23 - an internship or something like that uh
05:25 - for get a coach uh there's tons of
05:28 - different coaches for different
05:29 - Industries depending on your profession
05:31 - getting a coach can really help with
05:34 - understanding perspective maybe they see
05:36 - certain things that you don't
05:38 - yeah five having a
05:41 - fluid like
05:43 - organic brand a brand that is authentic
05:47 - to you be authentic be unapologetically
05:50 - you
05:51 - people gravitate towards that I love
05:53 - that we should definitely encourage
05:55 - people to be more authentic absolutely
05:57 - and I think authenticity you can't
05:58 - replace just like you said so that was
06:00 - great
06:01 - alrighty how does self-care impact your
06:04 - gaming
06:05 - anything that's affecting you outside of
06:06 - the game will
06:09 - affect you inside of the game because
06:11 - it's clouded by maybe negativity or a
06:14 - weight that is uh bogging you down
06:17 - so or even like anxiety performance
06:20 - nerves any of that doubts because
06:22 - everybody has them and having that
06:24 - self-care whether it's therapy having
06:26 - coaches multiple performance coaches
06:27 - anything
06:28 - they are there to help you wash those
06:32 - doubts away they're there to help help
06:34 - you gain that confidence but you have to
06:36 - put in the work right which means you do
06:37 - the exercises you do the deep breathing
06:39 - you do the journal you do the meditation
06:41 - right do you take on better nutrition
06:43 - because all that stuff outside the game
06:45 - makes your body well prepared and it
06:48 - feels healthy
06:49 - um it makes you ready to play a
06:52 - tournament because these are like
06:53 - marathons you're running when you when
06:55 - you play a tournament long hours it's
06:57 - two to three days so you need to make
06:59 - sure you're being the best version of
07:00 - yourself that you can be and self-care
07:02 - is such an essential part of that
07:03 - absolutely I think that self-care is the
07:06 - basis of any successful career so I'm
07:08 - glad that you said that
07:10 - all right Janelle thank you so much for
