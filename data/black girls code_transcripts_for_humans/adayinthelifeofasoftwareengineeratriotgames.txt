00:00 - as a software engineer at write games I
00:02 - usually start by waking up either going
00:06 - into the office or starting at home and
00:09 - then I'll start with the stand up so we
00:12 - can discuss what we were doing the
00:13 - previous day any blockers that we need
00:16 - to go through and any tasks that we're
00:17 - going to take on that day then we move
00:20 - on to those tasks and sometimes we work
00:23 - independently or sometimes you work
00:24 - individually on a task you know when I
00:27 - wrap up a task I can have someone else
00:30 - on the team or some content developers
00:32 - on the team validate it moving into done
00:35 - and then you continue on to the next
00:36 - task and you get a really nice overview
00:38 - of a lot of different things in my
00:41 - particular area but you know there's
00:43 - different teams that you can work on in
00:46 - engineering and it's all just really fun
00:48 - to work with a lot of different people
