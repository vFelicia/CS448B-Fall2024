With timestamps:

00:00 - well good afternoon everyone and thank
00:02 - you
00:03 - so much for being here my name is isis
00:06 - miller and i'm the community and events
00:07 - manager for black girls code
00:09 - it's obviously my absolute pleasure to
00:12 - be hosting this
00:13 - intimate conversation with the dynamic
00:15 - cast of a babysitter's guide to monster
00:17 - hunting
00:18 - at black girls code we know just how
00:21 - important
00:22 - representation is for young women
00:24 - especially
00:25 - girls of color so we of course were
00:28 - thrilled to see a cast of
00:30 - brilliant brave funny diverse characters
00:33 - that our girls could look up to
00:35 - so i'm gonna jump right into it today i
00:38 - am joined by the stars of the film
00:41 - tamara smart luna lawrence troy leanne
00:44 - johnson
00:44 - and lynne masaka chang what were some of
00:47 - the
00:47 - underlying themes that you sort of hoped
00:50 - would resonate
00:51 - with the kids who would be watching the
00:52 - film and una i'll let you start with
00:54 - that one
00:55 - i mean one of the big ones is owning
00:57 - your unique skills and
00:58 - talents and um just be being unabashedly
01:02 - yourself
01:03 - um i think you can see that in kelly's
01:05 - arc um she's
01:06 - accepts herself by like truly accepts
01:09 - herself by the end of the movie
01:10 - and i think just also like the power of
01:12 - young people
01:14 - like the babysitters are able to protect
01:16 - their charges
01:17 - and fight against evil monsters and keep
01:19 - the secret society like under wraps
01:21 - completely
01:22 - like and only teenagers and i think
01:24 - that's just so cool and that's exactly
01:26 - what we need
01:27 - in this world today actually speaking of
01:30 - bad guys
01:31 - and monster hunting how do you slay
01:34 - the villains and monsters in your own
01:36 - life like
01:37 - self-doubt or insecurity or
01:41 - having someone underestimate you because
01:43 - you're a kid or because
01:44 - of your your girl or because you are
01:47 - black or brown
01:48 - like how do you defeat those monsters in
01:50 - your life i think it can be really
01:52 - really hard especially we all sort of
01:54 - started in this industry
01:55 - really really young so we sort of went
01:56 - through those teenage years and they're
01:58 - still going through them where we're
02:00 - constantly changing and finding out what
02:02 - we believe in
02:03 - and i think it can become really hectic
02:05 - when you also have those voices in your
02:06 - head telling you that you're not good
02:07 - enough
02:08 - if you know what you love which is
02:10 - acting you can sort of replace all of
02:12 - those thoughts with the positive ones of
02:14 - you know
02:14 - being your own you know creative person
02:17 - and working on new projects and
02:19 - having a social media account can also
02:22 - help you know
02:23 - highlight things that you believe in
02:24 - things like the black lives matter
02:26 - movement you can you know
02:27 - teach other people how to educate
02:29 - themselves
02:31 - absolutely i'm going to start with one
02:33 - of our ambassadors
02:34 - and if is going to ask you all a
02:36 - question who are some other people whose
02:38 - work you admire or who have inspired you
02:41 - i mean for me my sole inspiration is
02:44 - mindy kaling
02:45 - she's brought so much poc representation
02:48 - on screen to hollywood
02:50 - to comedy she showed me that
02:53 - there's it's possible for asian people
02:55 - people of color to be portrayed on
02:57 - screen without it being a stereotyper
03:00 - so i think that was really inspiring to
03:01 - kind of see that and to see myself
03:03 - represented on screen
03:05 - i absolutely love issa rae um
03:08 - i think that she's someone else who
03:10 - brings a lot of representation into this
03:12 - industry
03:13 - she just does it all and she's so
03:15 - talented and i
03:17 - fell in love with her series awkward
03:18 - black girl because it's like
03:20 - i am an awkward black girl and i'd never
03:22 - seen
03:23 - like someone who looks like me
03:25 - represented in a way that i could relate
03:27 - to
03:27 - that much so i just love her so so much
03:31 - fame oh my gosh i'm such an issa stan
03:34 - awkward black girl i was like oh my god
03:35 - it's me shout out for all the awkward
03:38 - black girls
03:41 - so next i'm going to call samaya one of
03:44 - our favorite bgc ambassadors
03:46 - uh samaya go ahead with your question so
03:48 - i noticed that all of the babysitters
03:50 - were skilled
03:51 - in stem but i also saw there are a lot
03:53 - of like the performing arts incorporated
03:55 - and i think it really just shows that
03:57 - arts feel creativity
03:59 - like everything we do from monster
04:02 - printing to
04:03 - any other daily task so what i feel is
04:06 - the importance of incorporating art in
04:08 - stem
04:10 - i mean the arts requires so much
04:11 - imagination and creativity
04:14 - and so does stem i mean like all the
04:15 - technology that you see coming out
04:17 - requires you literally thinking of
04:19 - something that hasn't been done before
04:21 - and um so i think you can't really
04:24 - separate the two
04:26 - doing anything involving stem just takes
04:28 - so much creativity like when you think
04:30 - of the people who invented like
04:32 - instagram or like invented netflix it's
04:35 - like yes that took
04:36 - having skills in stem and it took having
04:38 - a lot of creativity and being able to
04:40 - use your imagination and
04:42 - it's kind of like what i said earlier
04:43 - like we wouldn't even have the film
04:45 - industry i don't think if it weren't for
04:47 - mixing art and creativity and stem
04:50 - we know that at bgc we we want our girls
04:53 - to be
04:54 - well-rounded so while stem is important
04:57 - we can't forget the a
04:58 - and we can't forget the arts and i know
05:00 - that samaya especially as an
05:02 - don't you do acting as well samaya
05:04 - acting singing and dancing
05:07 - so we seeing these ladies very soon on
05:09 - the silver screen
05:13 - elizabeth has a question alyssa go ahead
05:17 - um my question is even though you are a
05:19 - celebrity and you have many
05:20 - responsibilities
05:22 - do you still get the opportunity to just
05:24 - be a kid and have fun
05:26 - yeah of course there are many you know
05:28 - responsibilities and things to do on set
05:30 - but i can tell you when we weren't on
05:32 - set we were causing some mischief
05:35 - weren't we girls um we were definitely
05:38 - we definitely got a chance to be kids
05:39 - and run around and you know
05:41 - sort of you know be immature but in the
05:43 - best way
05:44 - when you aren't acting and when we
05:46 - aren't you know doing all the serious
05:48 - stuff
05:49 - we're just running around and having fun
05:51 - so my question is
05:53 - if you weren't an actor what would you
05:56 - want to be
05:57 - i love talking so i think i would want
06:00 - to be like a
06:01 - public speaker of some kind or a
06:04 - journalist
06:05 - because i love writing so probably those
06:08 - two
06:09 - kamara you want to go ahead and ask your
06:11 - question what advice do you have for
06:13 - kids that are worried about being
06:15 - bullied or
06:15 - teased for being smart or different
06:18 - being different is being special try and
06:21 - keep away from the negative people and
06:23 - try and keep positive thoughts
06:25 - and yeah always keep that uniqueness in
06:27 - you don't change for other people
06:28 - don't let like some negative lost person
06:31 - take away from you like what makes you
06:33 - special
06:34 - i think the main thing is to just
06:36 - remember to stay true to yourself
06:38 - and that other people's negative
06:40 - thoughts don't matter because you're
06:41 - amazing and you're unique and you're
06:43 - beautiful
06:44 - and if you just remember that
06:46 - everything's going to be fine
06:47 - thank you ladies so so much for
06:50 - answering our questions and hanging out
06:52 - with us today and just being your really
06:54 - cool beautiful selves
06:56 - girls if we could just give away to the
06:58 - to everyone in the cast and say thanks
