01:05 - able
01:06 - to have the right mindset to be a black

01:10 - and i just feel that you know it gets
01:12 - hard
01:13 - but you can always always find your way
01:16 - through it
01:17 - and that would be some advice that i
01:19 - would give a young girl that's

01:34 - with different places i've been to
01:36 - teaching me new things
01:38 - and one particular thing that black
01:40 - cross code has
01:42 - um brought event that they brought me to
01:44 - was
01:45 - the new york stock exchange and honestly
01:46 - that was a breathtaking moment and it's
01:49 - just
