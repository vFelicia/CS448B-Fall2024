00:00 - hey hey Gamers welcome back to the code
00:03 - Zone it's your girl Cheyenne in our last
00:06 - video we focused on learning how to
00:08 - navigate the virtual world and use the
00:10 - basic tools to create different parts we
00:13 - also built level one of our Avi and by
00:15 - the end of this video we will have built
00:18 - out level 2 of our sixth level Obby we
00:20 - have lots to do so let's get back to
00:22 - creating
00:23 - [Music]
00:30 - all right guys let's get to coding if
00:33 - you've closed out of the Roblox studio
00:34 - and need to find your Obby again you'll
00:36 - go to file open from Roblox and choose
00:40 - your game
00:41 - now on to the fun part let's start by
00:44 - creating a separate area for level two
00:46 - of our futuristic Obby but first let me
00:49 - go back to my storyboard to remember
00:51 - what I envisioned level 2 to look like
00:54 - ah now I see level two was supposed to
00:58 - represent the disappearing Forest caused
01:00 - by human development in level 2 we want
01:03 - to add more complex obstacles aside from
01:05 - our normal parts and thankfully that's
01:07 - really easy to do in Roblox Roblox has
01:10 - an awesome community of software
01:11 - engineers and creative people that
01:13 - contribute to its Library a community
01:15 - that you're now part of period on the
01:19 - left hand side you will see your toolbox
01:21 - the first tab is the marketplace where
01:24 - others have added many different types
01:27 - of objects the second tab is the objects
01:30 - you've bought and have added to your
01:31 - inventory
01:33 - the third tab contains the objects you
01:35 - have used recently and the last tab has
01:38 - objects that you've created
01:41 - start we'll be mainly using the first
01:43 - tab Marketplace to find objects to add
01:46 - to our Obby now that we're building
01:47 - level 2 we want to add a new spawn base
01:50 - plate for our character to appear type
01:53 - in checkpoint and you will see lots of
01:55 - options to choose from a checkpoint is a
01:59 - base plate where the player can respawn
02:01 - or restart after reaching certain parts
02:03 - of your game choose the first checkpoint
02:06 - option I'm going to drag and drop the
02:09 - checkpoint to the very end of level 1.
02:11 - that way our player who has made it
02:14 - safely across level 1 but has fallen in
02:16 - level 2 doesn't have to start all the
02:18 - way from the beginning of the game I'm
02:21 - also going to add a checkpoint at the
02:23 - very end of level 2 for that same reason
02:25 - our players will thank us for this okay
02:28 - they better every time you add a new
02:32 - part or object to the workspace it is
02:34 - also added to the Explorer it is good
02:37 - practice to rename your parts or objects
02:39 - so that you can tell the difference
02:40 - between them otherwise you will have a
02:43 - lot of parts that say part or objects
02:46 - that say checkpoint and that can be
02:48 - confusing when looking for specific
02:50 - parts or objects to change why don't we
02:52 - change the name of our checkpoint to
02:55 - checkpoint one so to start level 2 I
02:58 - need to create another floor that
03:00 - matches the theme of the new level how
03:02 - might we do that hmm I'll give you a
03:05 - hint work smarter and not harder okay
03:08 - you heard yeah the easiest way is to
03:11 - select the current base plate from level
03:13 - one then copy and paste the level 2 base
03:16 - plate along to the edge of level one
03:18 - next let's change the color of the floor
03:21 - to match that of a forest and grass
03:24 - foreign
03:24 - [Music]
03:27 - brownish green will do
03:30 - and we're gonna adjust the material to a
03:33 - leafy grass now since obbys typically
03:36 - get harder as the player advances in
03:38 - levels let's use the toolbox to find
03:40 - challenging obstacles need a little
03:42 - challenge okay a popular part to use is
03:46 - the conveyor belt which moves characters
03:48 - and objects along the path at an
03:50 - accelerated Pace the conveyor belt makes
03:53 - sense at this level because it makes me
03:55 - think of the workers moving to and
03:57 - through the forest working to clear it
03:59 - oh God I'm that's a topic for another
04:02 - day I don't even want to talk about it
04:03 - let's search for conveyor belt in the
04:06 - marketplace you will see a lot of
04:08 - options to choose from I'm going to
04:10 - select the second option but feel free
04:12 - to choose the one you like best
04:14 - then I can drag that part to the place I
04:17 - want it to be on the floor
04:20 - [Music]
04:28 - I can put together a few instant reset
04:31 - blocks which will immediately send the
04:33 - character back to the last checkpoint I
04:36 - put these along the conveyor belt so the
04:38 - player has a challenge of avoiding them
04:40 - when they're moving fast
04:44 - foreign
04:45 - [Music]
05:04 - okay I also want to add another element
05:08 - to make the level even harder than the
05:11 - first okay I know I'm so evil
05:13 - so I'm going to add a spinner if the
05:16 - characters come in contact with the
05:18 - spinner then they will be sent back to
05:20 - the checkpoint so they will have to be
05:22 - really careful to avoid it I'll imagine
05:25 - it is one of the deforestation
05:26 - construction tools the player has to
05:29 - watch out for in the forest I'll imagine
05:31 - the spinner is just moving rapidly
05:33 - chopping down trees in path like
05:37 - you know what I'm saying there are many
05:39 - types of spinners that you can choose
05:41 - from but I want to add a metal spinner
05:43 - so that it looks like a construction
05:45 - tool but please feel free to choose
05:48 - whatever you like best I'll choose the
05:50 - lava spinner and just change the color
05:52 - to Gray
05:53 - [Music]
06:03 - thank you
06:11 - after our players get through the
06:13 - spinner let's have them go through an
06:15 - elevated path that mimics a tightrope
06:17 - maze we'll need a tree to get to that
06:20 - pathway search for Tower in the
06:23 - marketplace and place it at the edge of
06:25 - our level 2 base plate
06:29 - rename the model to tree tower now find
06:33 - the center part and rename it to trunk
06:36 - and change the color from red to Brown
06:39 - in the property screen
06:41 - and while we're at it why don't we also
06:43 - change the color of each raised platform
06:45 - from Gray to Green
06:53 - time to add our pathway search for
06:56 - tightrope in the marketplace
06:59 - select the second option tightrope
07:03 - [Music]
07:12 - create your maze-like pattern with the
07:15 - parts on the base plate
07:22 - [Music]
07:29 - once you're complete with your pattern
07:32 - select all the parts
07:35 - then click the group in the edit
07:37 - navigation bar
07:39 - this will group all your parts together
07:41 - and create a model that you can rename
07:44 - maze log
07:45 - next use the move tool to elevate the
07:49 - path to the desired position connected
07:51 - to the tree Tower
07:52 - [Music]
07:57 - once the maze is where you want it to be
07:59 - you don't want it to move right so you
08:02 - can go and click anchor in the edit
08:04 - navigation bar
08:06 - make sure your maze leads you to where
08:08 - you want your level 3 to begin now let's
08:10 - test it out press play and see if your
08:13 - avatar can make it through the tower
08:14 - tree and log maze
08:28 - y'all oh my God I can't even deal we are
08:31 - making great progress on level two of
08:33 - our Obby we're almost through this level
08:35 - but before we finish why don't we add
08:37 - another little fun object to our course
08:39 - this time we will be adding a couple of
08:42 - buttons buttons have many functions when
08:45 - you press a button it can either make a
08:47 - part appear or disappear it can make a
08:50 - sound and it can activate and deactivate
08:53 - objects
08:54 - you know how people love pressing
08:56 - buttons for whatever reason even if they
08:58 - don't know what it'll do well we're
09:00 - going to try to see if our players fall
09:02 - into this trap it's a little sneaky of
09:04 - us but it's all fair and fun and Roblox
09:07 - so let's add a self-destruct button on
09:10 - top of the platform of our tree tower
09:12 - that will destroy our entire world
09:16 - [Music]
09:26 - I know it's a bit dramatic but so is the
09:30 - fact that our forests are being
09:31 - destroyed okay talk about that now why
09:34 - don't you go ahead and explore the
09:36 - different buttons and try adding them to
09:38 - your hobby
09:39 - [Music]
09:54 - now let's finish level 2 of our Obby I
09:58 - mean can you believe all the progress
10:00 - we've made in just one video now that
10:02 - we're at the end of level two can you
10:04 - guess what we'll need to do
10:06 - add another checkpoint
10:08 - bet that way a player can respond here
10:11 - in case they don't make it across level
10:13 - three
10:15 - [Music]
10:21 - now that I've completed level two I'm
10:24 - going to save my progress so that I can
10:26 - continue to work on it next time by
10:28 - going to file save to Roblox
10:33 - okay fam you did that but if you're
10:36 - craving to add more into level one and
10:39 - two Obby before our next video please go
10:41 - ahead and have fun doing that I'll see
10:43 - you back here for video four whenever
10:45 - you're ready we'll bring everything that
10:47 - we learned together to create our level
10:48 - three of our Obby and learn more about
10:51 - how to make customizations so that our
10:53 - Obby can be even more unique and
10:55 - challenging for our players bye for now
10:57 - and as always game on
11:01 - [Music]
11:08 - thank you

hey hey Gamers welcome back to the code Zone it's your girl Cheyenne in our last video we focused on learning how to navigate the virtual world and use the basic tools to create different parts we
