00:00 - hey hey gaming family I'm your host
00:02 - Cheyenne and I'm so excited to have you
00:05 - here for video five in the previous
00:07 - video we focused on adding scripts to
00:10 - objects in order to customize the Obby
00:12 - and make it more unique to our taste but
00:15 - also more challenging and tricky to our
00:18 - players
00:19 - like this
00:21 - cool right I know but I'm feeling
00:25 - generous to our players right now we'll
00:26 - learn how to add helpful game elements
00:29 - like power ups there's a lot to get done
00:31 - so why don't we get started and have
00:33 - some fun
00:34 - [Music]
00:41 - if we look at our storyboard in level 4
00:43 - we are building out a futuristic city
00:46 - that has a lot of tall buildings and
00:48 - obstacles but it's also a Greener space
00:50 - with more cyclists than drivers and
00:53 - there's also a lot less pollution since
00:55 - this is our optimistic view of the city
00:58 - of tomorrow let's get to building our
01:00 - futuristic city first things first we'll
01:02 - need to build the infrastructure of our
01:04 - city in the marketplace I am going to
01:06 - search for roads and buildings to add
01:10 - thank you
01:12 - foreign
01:13 - [Music]
01:18 - the obstacles we covered in the previous
01:20 - videos to make the level really
01:22 - difficult to pass
01:24 - as players move through each Obby and
01:27 - the levels get harder and harder it
01:29 - would be great to give them a little bit
01:31 - of help through power ups
01:33 - that can be a nice game developer but
01:36 - not too nice okay to allow them to have
01:38 - special abilities we can add power ups
01:41 - throughout the Abbey the power ups can
01:43 - be hidden or visible to make it easier
01:45 - to get through certain tough sections so
01:47 - the power up I want to add is the
01:49 - ability to run faster through obstacles
01:51 - to do this search for Speed in the
01:54 - marketplace and add the speed pad drag
01:57 - and drop it to a location in the
01:59 - workplace where speed will help the
02:01 - player complete the Obi faster
02:03 - to adjust the speed of the speed pad go
02:07 - to the walk speed variable and change it
02:09 - to how fast you want the Avatar to go
02:11 - once they touch the object now test out
02:13 - your power ups
02:15 - [Music]
02:19 - yes okay it's giving multifaceted nice
02:23 - job the player now has some
02:25 - superhero-like abilities sorry but
02:28 - swinging like Spider-Man and flying like
02:31 - Wonder Woman are still off the table for
02:33 - now like a lot of superheroes they are
02:36 - tougher than the bad guys and have
02:37 - superhuman abilities like being
02:39 - Invincible to damage okay such a flex
02:42 - let's give our Avatar the ability to be
02:45 - Invincible search the marketplace for
02:47 - invincibility then select this option
02:50 - this part will give the Avatar the
02:52 - ability to have Max Health after it
02:54 - touches the part
02:56 - now drag and drop the new script into
02:58 - our part or block
03:01 - then press play to track your status of
03:04 - your health you can go to the health and
03:06 - Max Health properties on your avatar in
03:09 - the Explorer search bar type in humanoid
03:12 - then scroll until you see the humanoid
03:15 - icon under your username next look at
03:18 - the property screen below and scroll
03:20 - down to the game drop down menu
03:23 - you will see properties for your health
03:25 - and Max Health now if you run over the
03:28 - invincibility block then your health
03:30 - will turn to Infinity
03:32 - that's excellent now you're protected
03:34 - from a lot of dangerous obstacles but
03:36 - not all of them if you touch a spinner
03:38 - with a reset script or code that makes
03:41 - your health go instantly to zero then
03:43 - your avatar will still reset even though
03:45 - your health was at Infinity so how do
03:48 - you truly become invincible
03:50 - open the script from the Invincible
03:53 - block we need to attach a marker to our
03:56 - Avatar to let the obstacles with the
03:58 - instant reset script like Spinners and
04:01 - fire know that we cannot be harmed
04:03 - inside our if statement we can create a
04:06 - local variable that stores the
04:08 - Invincible marker when the Avatar
04:10 - touches the invincibility block the
04:12 - Invincible marker will be attached now
04:15 - go to a spinner and open the script in
04:17 - Explorer
04:18 - go to the if statement and add a second
04:21 - condition to check for the Invincible
04:23 - marker on the avatar
04:25 - if the if statement reached true such as
04:27 - the Avatar does exist and does not have
04:30 - an invincible marker attached then
04:32 - Health should be zero to be Invincible
04:35 - on all dangerous obstacles then you will
04:37 - need to add this code to all of your if
04:40 - statements Let's test out our new
04:42 - ability press play
04:44 - run over to the invincibility block then
04:47 - jump on the spinner that can identify
04:48 - our marker do you reset or are you
04:51 - invincible

04:55 - the ability to use power-ups to become
04:58 - invincible get it girl we're playing you
