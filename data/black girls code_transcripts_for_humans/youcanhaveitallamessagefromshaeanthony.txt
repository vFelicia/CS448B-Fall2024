00:00 - one thing lesson that I've learned that
00:01 - I want to share is that you can do both

00:05 - have to be either a starving artist or
00:06 - you have to you know have a career first
00:08 - off you can love your day job right
00:09 - obviously you would want to you don't
00:11 - want to just have a job but you can have

00:17 - this week or maybe I didn't you know I

00:26 - you I feel like there's a lot of stigma
00:28 - about like I said Gee you got to devote
00:30 - to either one and if you if you're
00:31 - career driven you're giving up on your

00:45 - sometimes people at my job you're like
00:47 - why are you still working I'm just like
00:48 - I I enjoy still doing this and doing the
00:51 - other one I don't feel like I'm
00:52 - sacrificing my business
