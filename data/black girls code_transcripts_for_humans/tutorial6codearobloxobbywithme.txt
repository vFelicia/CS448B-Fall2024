00:00 - hey hey gaming family I'm your host
00:02 - Cheyenne and I'm so excited to welcome
00:05 - you back to video six in this video it's
00:08 - time to add some more Flair and pop to
00:11 - our game we'll learn how to create
00:12 - banners for each new level and even add
00:15 - sounds and background music we'll also
00:17 - be building out level five the return of
00:20 - the Wild
00:21 - and level six the ocean blue of our Avi
00:28 - [Music]
00:32 - first things first let's build the level
00:35 - 5 floor copy the floor from level four
00:38 - and paste it where you want your level
00:40 - to start
00:44 - rename the floor to level 5 Forest then
00:47 - change the color in the property screen
00:49 - to Green
00:50 - [Music]
00:53 - next let's build the level 6 floor copy
00:57 - the green floor from level five and
00:59 - paste it next to level five
01:01 - rename the floor to level 6 ocean then
01:04 - change the color of the floor to a deep
01:06 - blue
01:08 - even though the ocean is clean and blue
01:10 - let's still add a kill script if someone
01:12 - touches the water because the ocean is
01:15 - too deep to swim in
01:17 - all I'm going to do is copy and paste
01:20 - the kill script from our previously
01:22 - created lava spinner into our level 6
01:24 - ocean
01:25 - [Music]
01:28 - hey there we go we've begun building
01:31 - both level five and six you're a natural
01:34 - at this look at you killing it now I'll
01:37 - add banners to our checkpoints that
01:39 - congratulate our games players on making
01:41 - it to the next level hey oh my gosh wow
01:46 - I definitely wasn't expecting all that
01:47 - we can also use our Banner to inform
01:50 - them about the next level it's our way
01:52 - of giving them a little sneak peek of
01:54 - what they're about to encounter next and
01:56 - to encourage them to keep going our game
01:58 - is kind of a marathon and we've made
02:01 - some levels extra challenging so they're
02:04 - gonna need all the encouragement they
02:06 - can get to add the banner go to the
02:08 - marketplace and search for text Banner
02:12 - let's place the banner over our level 1
02:15 - checkpoint
02:16 - rename the object Banner one in your
02:19 - Explorer
02:22 - I'm going to change the banner color in
02:25 - my property screen to green and the
02:27 - transparency to zero
02:33 - foreign
02:37 - next I want to add text saying congrats
02:40 - on passing level one you are now gifted
02:42 - with a super jump power up you can put
02:45 - in your own personal message for your
02:46 - player this is another way to keep the
02:48 - player engaged in the game go to the
02:50 - banner one object in the Explorer and
02:53 - open the part then open the script
02:56 - change the save variable text to
02:58 - congrats on passing level one you're now
03:01 - gifted with a super jump power up or
03:03 - whatever your message is for the first
03:05 - label and you're about to enter level
03:07 - two the scarce Forest
03:09 - [Music]
03:10 - go over to the property screen and
03:13 - scroll down to the text drop down menu
03:16 - [Music]
03:20 - we can also change the font face to
03:22 - luckiest guy
03:27 - to bold
03:32 - text color 3 to Orange
03:35 - [Music]
03:38 - text size to 14. we
03:41 - ustomize the text for our Banner okay I
03:44 - want to add another cool feature to my
03:46 - banner I want the banner to be invisible
03:48 - at first then when the Avatar jumps on
03:51 - the checkpoint the banner will appear
03:52 - above it will be a big surprise for our
03:55 - player that way say look at me I could
03:57 - be nice let's add another script tag to
03:59 - Banner one
04:02 - [Music]
04:04 - and rename it to appear
04:08 - set your banner one object in the script
04:10 - to a local variable
04:12 - from there we can set our initial
04:15 - transparency and can Collide properties
04:17 - to one and false so the banner will be
04:20 - invisible and doesn't act as a wall
04:25 - in our previous video we made a
04:27 - disappear and a peer function to set and
04:30 - toggle the block properties this time I
04:33 - want to make an untouched function that
04:35 - detects if the Avatar touches the banner
04:37 - below the function I want to connect the
04:40 - banner to the touched event
04:42 - [Music]
04:46 - now that we have our initial properties
04:49 - and functions set up let's add the magic
04:53 - we need to determine if the Avatar has
04:56 - touched the banner or not there is a
04:58 - built-in function that searches for an
05:01 - object called humanoid that's the Avatar
05:03 - and it determines if the Avatar touches
05:06 - a part or an object inside of our
05:09 - untouched function we can use a
05:11 - conditional called an if statement to
05:13 - see if our humanoid Avatar comes in
05:15 - contact with the banner if an avatar
05:18 - comes in contact with the banner then
05:20 - the statement will run the code inside
05:22 - of it if the Avatar doesn't touch the
05:24 - banner the code will not trigger now
05:26 - it's time to add the following code
05:29 - [Music]
05:34 - do is change the transparency property
05:37 - to zero press play to test out the new
05:40 - feature the banner should be invisible
05:42 - at first but then visible when the
05:44 - Avatar runs into it
05:47 - didn't work didn't work I already know
05:49 - it worked for you I didn't even have to
05:50 - ask let's make the banner float above
05:52 - the checkpoint because we'll need our
05:54 - players to be able to see the banner
05:56 - can't have a message of positivity
05:58 - laying crumbled on the ground am I right
06:00 - like who's gonna see that search for
06:02 - floating script in the marketplace
06:06 - the floating script comes with pre-made
06:09 - code from other Roblox creators but let
06:11 - down we have two variables depth and
06:14 - speed to determine how far up or down
06:17 - the object moves and how fast we want
06:20 - the object to move to move the banner we
06:22 - can grab the coordinate frame from an
06:24 - object in the workspace
06:25 - it is used to rotate and position 3D
06:28 - objects a C frame contains Global X Y
06:32 - and Z coordinates replacing either of
06:35 - the X Y and Z will determine the new
06:38 - position of the object like so because
06:41 - we're working smarter and not harder
06:43 - like always you can copy the floating
06:46 - script code and paste it inside the if
06:48 - statement of our untouched function
06:52 - [Music]
06:54 - [Applause]
06:58 - copy the depth and speed variables and
07:01 - paste it outside of the function
07:03 - [Music]
07:11 - now it's time to test out our new Banner
07:14 - press play
07:16 - [Music]
07:25 - yay it works look at you okay so now
07:29 - that we've added a banner let's add
07:31 - another awesome feature to our Obby
07:34 - sound sound makes the world of our video
07:37 - game that much more real think of
07:39 - watching an action movie without any
07:41 - sound effects
07:45 - weird right in video games there are
07:48 - usually a ton of sound effects and music
07:50 - that matches the vibe of the game so
07:52 - since we are game developers we will
07:54 - make sure our game is just as awesome
07:56 - let's start small by adding sound to an
07:59 - object because baby steps am I right to
08:02 - do that click the marketplace Tab and
08:05 - select audio from the menu
08:07 - search for the sound you want I want to
08:10 - add the sound of stepping through grass
08:11 - you can preview the sound you want to
08:14 - add and also change the length of it by
08:16 - clicking the button next to the search
08:18 - icon you can click insert and the sound
08:20 - will be added to your workspace
08:22 - drag the sound to your desired object I
08:26 - want to add the sound to my level 2
08:27 - grass go to the property screen below
08:31 - the Explorer and make sure to click
08:33 - looped and playing so that your sound
08:35 - will run when you interact with the
08:37 - object now guess what I'm going to say
08:39 - guess what I'm going to say press play
08:41 - you can add sounds all throughout your
08:43 - game okay so go crazy pop off I mean
08:45 - like do you alrighty we took a baby step
08:49 - but now it's time to take a giant leap
08:52 - okay it's okay don't panic I got you
08:54 - let's add music to the background of our
08:57 - game to do that we'll go to the
08:59 - marketplace again and select the audio
09:02 - from the drop down menu select the music
09:05 - tab from there you can choose from
09:08 - various genres of music
09:10 - [Music]
09:18 - click insert and the music file will be
09:21 - added to your workspace make sure the
09:24 - music clip is added to the top level of
09:26 - your workspace and not inserted within
09:28 - an object or part also make sure to
09:31 - click looped and playing on your

10:15 - I'm just saying not to toot my own horn
10:17 - but tutu if you can do this now imagine
10:20 - what you'll be able to build with more
