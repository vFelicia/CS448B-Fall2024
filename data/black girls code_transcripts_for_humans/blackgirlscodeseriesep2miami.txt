00:50 - in the white community we just have
00:53 - lines that we won't cross we know that
00:56 - it's a way out unfortunately in our
00:58 - communities especially in South Florida
01:00 - we have a lot of real schools that are
01:02 - underperforming and they're under
01:04 - serving our kids so if that's the dialog
01:06 - you know if you're if you're a student
01:08 - and you have a teacher that doesn't want
01:10 - to be there and it's only there because
01:12 - to get a paycheck
01:13 - well that trickles down to how a child
01:15 - ends up feeling about their own

01:28 - fostering creativity they're not really
01:30 - promoting to kids to go to college or
01:32 - start businesses because that's not what
01:34 - passes the FCAT test it's not that black
01:39 - children minority children aren't smart
01:41 - enough a lot has to go back to their
01:43 - school systems aren't good enough so
01:45 - when you come from a school system that
01:47 - Hillary hugs you behind when you get to
01:49 - college you get explained you get
01:50 - exposed to people with much more diverse
01:53 - backgrounds and you're able to kick keep
01:56 - up it's just harder magnet oh they're
01:58 - just not smart my story is you know I'm
02:02 - from Baltimore no inner city you know I
02:06 - did a lot of things that inner city you
02:09 - know kid does you know I initially live

02:25 - young minority use our help back don't
02:27 - have the same don't have the same skills
02:30 - such as others but that doesn't mean
02:32 - that they can't get
02:54 - they take what they see in our children
02:57 - and use it and

04:18 - we're technologists that look like our
04:20 - kids to create platforms to really
04:23 - engage the young people and introduce
04:26 - them to these concepts because the
04:28 - schools can't and
04:30 - aren't able to do everything
04:34 - technology sitting my life because it
04:37 - gave me something that I thought was
04:38 - cool so now my thought was interesting

05:27 - girls a lot of them are consumers of
05:29 - technology where they're using popular
05:31 - applications such as Instagram Facebook
05:33 - etc however learning how to create those
05:37 - is something that just doesn't exist
05:39 - unless they're being exposed to it so
05:42 - today we were doing our workshop called
05:44 - build a game in a day and basically
05:46 - basically we taught the building blocks
