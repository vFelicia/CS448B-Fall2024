02:27 - currently a middle schooler at head boy
02:29 - school I'm here as a part of black girls
02:32 - code an organization that helps young
02:34 - girls of color learn about tech if our
02:37 - current generation knows how tech is
02:39 - relevant and how it how it will heavily
02:41 - impact our future then more people will
02:45 - gravitate towards it and more people
02:48 - will become a part of it I think the
02:51 - biggest challenge for our generation is
02:53 - that nobody knows what tech is we don't
02:56 - know it we can't use it you can't turn
02:58 - it into a career
02:59 - we can do anything with it except for
03:02 - watches everybody else creates things
03:06 - with it and we can only sit there on the
03:07 - sidelines thinking man I wish I could do
03:10 - that I wish I had those skills I wish I
03:12 - learned this when I was younger the
03:14 - worst thing to do is regret in life if
03:17 - you can try to see the light at the end
03:19 - of the tunnel and you try to reach for
03:21 - that light I think a lot of great things
03:24 - can happen from it even if you don't
03:26 - reach it
03:28 - [Applause]
