00:00 - what's up brilliant coders thanks so
00:02 - much for coming back and joining me for
00:04 - video one of our mini series on animated
00:07 - art so in our previous video series
00:09 - we've familiarized ourselves with p5.js
00:12 - and even applied our skills to make our
00:15 - very own artwork now in this series
00:18 - we'll learn how to make empowering
00:20 - animated arts art can transform Society
00:24 - but it can also transform how we look at
00:26 - ourselves and each other when I created
00:29 - this piece I wanted the viewer to feel
00:31 - that all hair is beautiful and should be
00:33 - accepted in society afros and
00:36 - afro-textured hair whether big small
00:39 - curly picked out or blow dried is
00:42 - beautiful thankfully there's been a huge
00:45 - push to expand society's acceptance of
00:47 - different hair types the natural hair
00:49 - love movement is getting bigger and
00:51 - bigger just like the hair in this video
00:53 - so yeah loving our hair is kind of a big
00:56 - deal and I want the world to know about
00:58 - it but why don't we jump in to coding
01:00 - this powerful animated art piece
01:07 - [Music]
01:10 - we'll Begin by drawing the face and the
01:12 - afro and as always to get started we'll
01:15 - want to
01:17 - that's right set the canvas size I want
01:21 - to create more space on our canvas so
01:24 - I'll change the default values from 400
01:27 - to 500.
01:29 - we will also be using arcs to create our
01:32 - facial features so I'll go ahead and add
01:35 - the angle mode function as well
01:37 - then go to the draw function and change
01:40 - the background to Blue then under
01:43 - background I'm going to label face now I
01:46 - want the face to be a brownish color and
01:48 - placed in the center of the canvas I'm
01:51 - going to use an ellipse and adjust the
01:53 - width and the height great now that we
01:56 - have a head we can start adding all the
01:58 - facial features with arcs see
02:01 - I told you that we'd use everything we
02:03 - already learned now I just want the
02:04 - hairline to span the top of the oval
02:07 - this code should work
02:09 - next are the eyebrows now I want the
02:13 - color to be darker than the skin tone
02:17 - next is the nose the nose will be a
02:20 - combination of three arcs a middle Arc
02:22 - for the nose and two smaller arcs for
02:25 - the nostrils let's check out the codes
02:28 - [Music]
02:39 - awesome we're almost done with drawing
02:41 - our face the last step to complete our
02:43 - face is to make the mouth now the mouth
02:45 - is also a series of arcs
02:49 - I'm going to choose a reddish brown
02:51 - color with no border for the upper part
02:54 - of my lips and a lighter red color for
02:56 - the bottom lip
02:57 - [Music]
03:01 - but there that's cute I'd wear that lip
03:04 - gloss
03:05 - next let's add the ears and earrings
03:09 - using arcs and circles for the ears we
03:12 - will use an arc but we want the last
03:14 - value of the arc to be open what does
03:18 - that mean exactly it means the open
03:20 - value creates a filled semi-circle
03:23 - similar to cutting an orange in half
03:25 - now we'll add the earrings by using
03:27 - circles and I'll make them gold
03:31 - [Music]
03:33 - again we are bad and bougie here but you
03:36 - can make them any color you want
03:54 - [Music]
03:56 - okay now that we have our basic facial
04:00 - features drawn let's add the most
04:02 - exciting part the afro now I want the
04:06 - afro to be big bold and beautiful of
04:10 - course some afros are round and tight
04:13 - some are curly and a little looser in
04:16 - this video I will show you how to add
04:18 - both but before we jump in in places
04:20 - like America after colonization natural
04:23 - hair was not celebrated black people
04:26 - were expected to hide and even tame
04:29 - their natural hair but during the Civil
04:32 - Rights movement in the 1960s the afro
04:35 - became a symbol of pride in being black
04:38 - and today thanks to the continued
04:41 - efforts of the natural hair movement the
04:43 - afro is just one of many natural
04:45 - hairstyles gaining visibility and
04:47 - acceptance which is super important
04:50 - because you should never have to
04:52 - apologize for being who you are now
04:54 - let's start drawing our round afro I
04:57 - want our afro to take up most of the
04:59 - space of the canvas so we can use a
05:01 - circle and Center it in the middle of
05:03 - our face
05:06 - now let's draw the second afro which
05:09 - will be slightly looser to do this we'll
05:12 - have to create our Curls by making many
05:14 - circles and placing them around the
05:17 - edges of the round afro we've already
05:19 - drawn and I want each curl to be black
05:22 - and the same size
05:25 - oh and just a reminder the easiest way
05:29 - to find a coordinate quickly is to use
05:32 - the X Y tool if you get in this mental
05:35 - time machine with me you might remember
05:37 - that in our previous videos we used
05:39 - variables to store a value so that we
05:42 - can use it in other parts of our
05:43 - functions and the name of the variable
05:46 - tells you what it is go to the area
05:49 - above our setup function and let's store
05:51 - the curl size in a variable called curls
05:54 - I'm going to set my curls with a value
05:56 - of 30. now we can replace the third
05:59 - value in our circle with curls
06:02 - you see nothing changes because curls
06:05 - represent the value 30 we assigned to it
06:08 - and look at that
06:10 - there's the drawing yes yes oh hey turn
06:15 - up the lights in here baby okay now it's
06:18 - time for the moment you have all been
06:20 - waiting for drum roll it's time to add
06:24 - animations to the curls so that they can
06:26 - grow
06:27 - p5js has a function that allows us to
06:30 - see our curls grow every time the mouse
06:33 - is pressed now the way we can do this is
06:36 - to scroll all the way down to the bottom
06:38 - of your canvas below your draw function
06:41 - and add console log open parentheses I
06:46 - press the mouse close parentheses
06:49 - now click anywhere on the drawing then
06:51 - look at your console now do you see I
06:55 - press the mouse
06:56 - yes that's it you did it go
06:58 - [Applause]
07:00 - okay so now we're gonna use the mouse
07:03 - pressed function to make our afro grow
07:06 - with the help of variables variables can
07:09 - be updated to represent new values that
07:12 - means every time the draw function runs
07:14 - we can set the curls variable to a new
07:17 - value let's see how this works in the
07:20 - mouse pressed function add the following
07:22 - curls equals curls plus one every time I
07:27 - press the mouse I add 1 to the total
07:30 - value of curls and update the current
07:32 - curls variable we can call this
07:34 - operation total sum representing the
07:37 - change of our curls now the curls of the
07:40 - afro are growing at a rate of one every
07:42 - time you press the mouse oh and make
07:45 - sure Auto refresh is selected so that
07:47 - you can see the changes immediately now
07:50 - the afro should be growing but it looks
07:52 - like it will keep growing into Infinity
07:54 - if we keep pressing the mouse which is
07:57 - definitely a cute look but not what I
08:00 - want to do in my exam sample so let's
08:01 - have the curls reset once they get to a
08:04 - certain size we'll use a conditional for
08:07 - Loop here meaning we'll set the for Loop
08:10 - to grow our curls until we want it to
08:12 - stop or the conditions become false
08:15 - below the curls operation write the
08:17 - following if the curls are more than 100
08:20 - they will reset to their original size
08:22 - of 30.
08:27 - Let's test it out
08:28 - [Music]
08:34 - foreign
08:35 - [Music]
08:48 - oh my gosh you did so much today we
08:52 - created this beautiful drawing and even
08:54 - learned how to animate it I mean
08:56 - it's permission to slay like this in the
08:59 - next video we're going to learn how to
09:01 - animate our artwork in a constant motion
09:03 - with a single click of the mouse thanks
09:06 - so much for joining me and celebrating
09:08 - our natural hair today we hope to see
09:10 - you next time where we can keep coding
09:12 - animated art until then stay cute and
09:16 - stay coding
09:17 - today
09:20 - [Music]

what's up brilliant coders thanks so much for coming back and joining me for video one of our mini series on animated art so in our previous video series we've familiarized ourselves with p5.js and even applied our skills to make our very own artwork now in this series we'll learn how to make empowering animated arts art can transform Society but it can also transform how we look at ourselves
