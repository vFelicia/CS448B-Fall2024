04:36 - great all right okay tell us about
04:38 - partnering with friends I feel like when
04:42 - you do have the opportunity to partner
04:44 - with a brand you have to see if that
04:47 - brand aligns with what you believe in
04:50 - um also knowing your worth too
04:52 - um you know with any industry or
04:55 - partnership like there's always going to
04:56 - be companies that try to you know try to
04:59 - figure out what they can pull from you
05:01 - you know and so you really have to know
05:03 - your worth and stand firm in what you

05:08 - worth too so I also think that's really
05:09 - important yeah for sure hmm okay nope
