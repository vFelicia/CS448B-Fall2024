00:08 - that in our last video we built out
00:10 - levels five and six of our Obby and in
00:13 - level six we made a blue floor to
00:15 - represent our ocean but what if I told
00:18 - you there was a better way to add a
00:21 - realistic ocean to our Avi it would be
00:23 - great if our game could be as realistic
00:25 - and immersive as possible so let's get
00:28 - started
00:31 - thank you
00:36 - to make our ocean more believable we can
00:38 - use a tool called terrain it has a lot
00:41 - of great options to choose from so that
00:43 - you can create an ocean as well as
00:44 - Islands click on the terrain tab in your
00:47 - navigation or selection bar you should
00:50 - see a new screen below the toolbox
00:52 - called terrain editor
00:55 - in the create tab we can press generate
00:57 - to make our first ocean you will see a
01:00 - light blue clearish box that represents
01:02 - your default area you want to cover you
01:05 - can adjust the size the same way you
01:07 - would a block part
01:09 - you can also change the depth of the Box
01:11 - by expanding along the y-axis or
01:15 - downward
01:16 - in the materials and settings drop down
01:18 - menu you can choose which type of biomes
01:21 - you want to include let's select water
01:24 - and dunes to create Islands
01:28 - but don't worry our player won't be
01:30 - vacationing here this is not the Bahamas
01:32 - it's still going to be a very
01:34 - challenging game next click generate and
01:37 - you will have a beautiful blue ocean
01:41 - let's change the ocean color to a deep
01:43 - sea ocean blue
01:45 - go over to your Explorer and select
01:49 - Terrain in your workspace then go to the
01:52 - property screen below and change the
01:54 - watercolor to a navy blue color
01:57 - [Music]
01:58 - Islands to the water
02:00 - select the edit Tab and click add
02:03 - go to the area where you want to put the
02:06 - island then drag and hold to create your
02:08 - shape you can drag in any direction now
02:12 - the Ocean looks amazing and healthy
02:14 - let's add our remaining obstacles to
02:17 - make it across the ocean once we have
02:19 - added all the extra features we want to
02:21 - our Obby the last thing we do is add an
02:24 - area where you go once you win I mean of
02:27 - course right let's look for a winners
02:30 - area in the marketplace there are many
02:32 - options to choose from some objects in
02:35 - the winners area have many different
02:37 - types of features that the Avatar can
02:39 - interact with but I want to choose one
02:42 - we can make our own understand we got to
02:44 - be different
02:45 - choose the option then drag and drop it
02:48 - to where you want the winners area to be
02:50 - I want to add it after the last Obstacle
02:53 - of level six rename the model in the
02:56 - Explorer to Winners area
02:59 - I want to add a disco floor that changes
03:02 - color when we enter the winners area
03:04 - like this hit it
03:05 - [Music]
03:08 - hey
03:10 - hello to the flow let it go
03:14 - oh let's start with one square block as
03:17 - our template then copy and paste many
03:20 - blocks together to create our floor
03:24 - in the Explorer rename it to disco block
03:27 - let's add a script to the Disco block
03:30 - and call it change color
03:33 - [Music]
03:39 - let's connect the script to the block
03:42 - part add a local variable called disco
03:45 - block we want the color to change to a
03:48 - random color every second we can grab
03:51 - the brick color property and then use
03:52 - another built-in function called random
03:55 - and set its initial argument to three
03:59 - if you remember from our previous video
04:01 - we used a while loop to Loop over our
04:04 - appear and disappear functions while the
04:07 - condition is true the loop will continue
04:09 - to run until it turns false then we use
04:12 - the built-in function called weight to
04:14 - set every time the block appeared and
04:16 - disappeared let's use the while loop to
04:19 - continuously Loop over the block and
04:21 - assign it a random color every turn I
04:24 - want to wait one second before the next
04:26 - color is chosen
04:29 - [Music]
04:30 - Let's test it out press play
04:35 - [Music]
04:42 - now that we have one block let's make
04:44 - many more put them together and make our
04:47 - floor after you're done getting your
04:49 - boogie down on the Disco floor let's add
04:52 - a rainbow sky for when the winner
04:54 - crosses the Finish Line go to the Disco
04:56 - block then add another script called
04:59 - start rainbow
05:00 - [Music]
05:02 - inside of the start rainbow I am going
05:05 - to grab the lighting property from our
05:07 - Explorer
05:09 - the lighting service controls the
05:12 - Environmental Lighting in a game it
05:14 - includes a range of adjustable
05:16 - properties that can be used to change
05:18 - how lighting appears and interacts with
05:21 - other objects next I will add my
05:24 - untouched function and set my
05:26 - conditional to when the Avatar comes in
05:28 - contact with the block
05:29 - [Music]
05:36 - next hover over the lighting option
05:39 - below workspace and click the plus sign
05:42 - on the side the sky object is an object
05:45 - that when placed inside lighting will
05:48 - change the appearance of the game's Sky
05:50 - the Sky Box is composed of six sides
05:53 - much like that of a cube after the
05:55 - Avatar touches the block I want to grab
05:58 - the Skybox properties from the
05:59 - appearance drop down menu and reassign
06:02 - them to the following code
