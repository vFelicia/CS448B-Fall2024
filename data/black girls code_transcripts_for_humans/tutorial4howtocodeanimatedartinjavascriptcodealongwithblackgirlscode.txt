00:00 - what's up for the encoders welcome back
00:03 - to the fourth and final video in our
00:05 - animated art series by now we're
00:08 - practically pros and we're gonna put all
00:10 - our Newfound coding skills to use to
00:13 - make the most epic animation
00:16 - [Music]
00:17 - hey then let's get into it come with me
00:20 - to the code Zone
00:21 - [Music]
00:27 - we're going to start this video by
00:29 - talking about functions we'll follow the
00:32 - same logic from our previous videos and
00:34 - create our own function the first thing
00:37 - I want to do is to go to the bottom of
00:39 - my draw function and create a function
00:42 - called draw flowers
00:44 - we are going to the bottom of the draw
00:46 - function so that the flowers will be
00:49 - drawn on top of the afro instead of
00:52 - behind them inside the draw flowers
00:54 - function I want to create my first
00:57 - flower we can use a circle as the center
01:00 - and the petals now let's place a
01:03 - rose-colored flower with a yellow Center
01:05 - on the top left hand corner of the afro
01:09 - then Place five circles around the
01:12 - center forming the petals
01:14 - [Music]
01:23 - remember you can be creative and shape
01:27 - and color the petals however you want
01:32 - one flower looks good but we want to
01:34 - create many flowers over the afro so how
01:38 - do we accomplish this
01:41 - that's right we'll use a for Loop see
01:45 - how everything we learned is just coming
01:47 - together we are going to make a for Loop
01:50 - that places our flowers across the
01:52 - x-axis of our afro in order to do this
01:55 - we first need to find the correct x
01:58 - value for each yellow Center and then
02:02 - find the correct x value for each pink
02:05 - petal and then Place those X values in
02:09 - our for Loop let's start with placing
02:11 - our yellow flower center in the for Loop
02:15 - I want to start at 110 which is where
02:18 - the yellow center of our current flower
02:19 - is and stop at 4 20. that means we have
02:23 - a space of 300 to place as many flowers
02:27 - as we want to but I just want to have
02:30 - three flowers across the top to do this
02:33 - I need to remember that every time the
02:35 - conditions are true the for Loop will
02:38 - run therefore I will add 140 to all of
02:42 - my x coordinates that means the first
02:45 - flower will be at its current position
02:47 - then the next will be 110 plus 140
02:50 - equals 250 and last flower will be at
02:54 - 250 plus 140 equals 390. it's
02:58 - compounding like my head after all of
03:01 - this new information so make sure you
03:03 - take a break if you need it let's
03:04 - replace the x coordinates in our circles
03:07 - with the x value from our for Loop
03:10 - okay now that we have moved our yellow
03:13 - flower centers across the x-axis we've
03:16 - got to move our petals as well in order
03:18 - to make a complete flower so to do this
03:21 - we have to subtract or add the
03:24 - difference between the current x value
03:26 - of each petal and the X variable from
03:30 - our for Loop to recreate the shape of
03:32 - the flower the current position of the
03:34 - first petal is x equals 121 so we
03:38 - subtract 121 from 110 and the difference
03:41 - is 11. we can replace the x value with X
03:45 - plus 11 and this will move the petal to
03:48 - the same position for each flower that
03:51 - is created
03:52 - then we will repeat the steps for the
03:54 - other petals take a look at the code
03:57 - [Music]
04:04 - you should now have three identical
04:06 - flowers across the top of the afro
04:09 - wrapping our flowers in one for Loop and
04:12 - replacing the x coordinates values
04:14 - creates many flowers in a row from left
04:17 - to right but I also want them to go up
04:19 - and down across the y-axis of the afro
04:22 - this means I need to create a grid of
04:25 - flowers think of it like a tic-tac-toe
04:28 - cord
04:29 - okay so that sounds gorgeous but how
04:32 - would I do that we can use another for
04:35 - Loop to add flowers in a column or up
04:38 - and down the y-axis so let's add another
04:41 - for Loop but inside the first one that
04:43 - represents all of our new y values for
04:45 - our flowers I'm going to name the
04:48 - variable y because we are going to
04:50 - replace the y coordinate in our Circle
04:52 - functions
04:53 - we can use the current yellow center of
04:56 - the first flower which starts at y
04:58 - equals 130. I want the column to stop at
05:02 - 450 and put a space of 130 pixels
05:06 - between each flower
05:10 - now that we moved the center of all of
05:12 - our flowers we are going to repeat the
05:15 - steps we completed previously to
05:17 - determine the Y values for our pink
05:19 - petals why don't we do that now go get
05:22 - to work I'll just wait here I mean
05:24 - working of course
05:27 - [Music]
05:34 - thank you
05:36 - [Music]
05:58 - great now you should have rows and
06:01 - Columns of flowers in a three by three
06:04 - grid on the afro if you comment out the
06:07 - face then you will be able to see the
06:09 - other two flowers behind the face
06:12 - next I'll add our pulsating animation to
06:16 - the flowers so I want the flowers to
06:18 - grow to a certain size then return to
06:21 - the same size but in the negative
06:23 - Direction you may be thinking right now
06:25 - what the heck is she talking about but I
06:28 - promise it's not that complicated a
06:31 - great example of an object moving to a
06:33 - certain value in the positive direction
06:35 - then returning to an equal value in the
06:37 - opposite direction is a wave when you
06:40 - look at waves in the ocean they move up
06:43 - and down the top of one wave may be 15
06:46 - feet tall but the bottom of the swell
06:49 - may be 15 feet deep this is not
06:51 - dissimilar to waves in math in math
06:54 - waves can be represented using the sine
06:57 - function the sine function keeps track
06:59 - of the angles in a wave the angles are
07:02 - either moving in a positive direction or
07:05 - a negative direction if you look at our
07:07 - example wave you can see the wave
07:09 - increasing to one as the angle increases
07:12 - but once we get to 90 degrees the wave
07:15 - starts to decrease back down towards
07:18 - zero at 180 degrees then gradually
07:22 - towards negative one as you increase to
07:25 - 270 degrees then the wave turns towards
07:29 - the positive direction as you get
07:30 - closest to 360 where it starts its cycle
07:33 - over again at zero we can use the sine
07:37 - function to increase and decrease our
07:39 - petals to equal and opposite values so
07:42 - the wave is actually making our flowers
07:44 - pulsate how cool right above our draw
07:48 - flowers function let's create a variable
07:50 - called wave speed and set the value to
07:54 - zero
07:55 - Below Wave speed create another variable
07:58 - called Max diameter and set its value to
08:01 - 40.
08:03 - as the name implies we want the maximum
08:06 - diameter or width of our petals to be
08:08 - 40. now let's use these variables to
08:11 - create our animation
08:13 - inside our draw function we are going to
08:16 - create another variable called diam
08:19 - short for diameter and set its value to
08:22 - the following
08:24 - the operation works as follows every
08:27 - time the draw flower function runs the
08:30 - diam variable will multiply our sine
08:33 - function times the max diameter we want
08:35 - the petals to be
08:37 - now change the last value in our Circle
08:41 - functions to the diam
08:43 - remember the last value in our Circle
08:45 - determines the size of each circle
08:48 - currently if we add the diameter
08:51 - function then our petals don't move
08:54 - hmm why is that it's because the wave is
08:57 - set to zero so that means there is no
09:00 - movement in our waves remember that the
09:03 - sine function moves like a wave once it
09:06 - reaches a certain height in the positive
09:08 - direction then it will move to the same
09:10 - height or depth but in the negative
09:12 - direction if you put it at zero it
09:15 - doesn't have any direction to move in
09:17 - let's update the wave speed variable so
09:20 - that we can see our animation to do that
09:23 - we can reuse our favorite total sum
09:26 - operation
09:28 - by adding the total sum operation we can
09:31 - update the sine function wave speed
09:33 - value to 1. so every time the draw
09:37 - flowers function updates the petals move
09:40 - in a positive direction towards our Max
09:42 - diameter then returns to equal and
09:45 - opposite direction of the max diameter
09:49 - now these flowers are moving and
09:51 - grooving look at that now I really love
09:55 - this piece because I just love that it
09:57 - shows our big afro natural hair and the
10:01 - flowers just like add a really nice
10:03 - Beauty touch to it
10:05 - so drum roll please
10:09 - because now I can officially Crown you
10:16 - through another four part video series
10:18 - on how to code digital art with
10:21 - animation and queen with this honor
10:24 - comes great responsibility to use your
10:26 - skills and talents to continue making
10:29 - art to change the world make sure to
10:32 - tune in next week because we're gonna
10:34 - meet with a dope real life digital
10:36 - artist who is going to drop some
10:38 - knowledge on how you can turn your
10:40 - digital art into nfts on the blockchain
10:43 - so until we meet again
10:46 - stay cute and stay coding
10:49 - [Music]

what's up for the encoders welcome back to the fourth and final video in our animated art series by now we're practically pros and we're gonna put all our Newfound coding skills to use to make the most epic animation hey then let's get into it come with me to the code Zone we're going to start this video by talking about functions we'll follow the same logic from our previous videos and create our own function the first thing I want to do is to go to the bottom of my draw function and create a function called draw flowers we are going to the bottom of the draw function so that the flowers will be drawn on top of the afro instead of behind them inside the draw flowers function I want to create my first flower we can use a circle as the center and the petals now let's place a rosecolored flower with a yellow Center on the top left hand corner of the afro then Place five circles around the center forming the petals remember you can be creative and shape and color the petals however you want one flower looks good but we want to create many flowers over the afro so how do we accomplish this that's right we'll use a for Loop see how everything we learned is just coming together we are going to make a for Loop that places our flowers across the xaxis of our afro in order to do this we first need to find the correct x value for each yellow Center and then find the correct x value for each pink petal and then Place those X values in our for Loop let's start with placing our yellow flower center in the for Loop I want to start at 110 which is where the yellow center of our current flower is and stop at 4 20. that means we have a space of 300 to place as many flowers as we want to but I just want to have three flowers across the top to do this I need to remember that every time the conditions are true the for Loop will run therefore I will add 140 to all of my x coordinates that means the first flower will be at its current position then the next will be 110 plus 140 equals 250 and last flower will be at 250 plus 140 equals 390. it's compounding like my head after all of this new information so make sure you take a break if you need it let's replace the x coordinates in our circles with the x value from our for Loop okay now that we have moved our yellow flower centers across the xaxis we've got to move our petals as well in order to make a complete flower so to do this we have to subtract or add the difference between the current x value of each petal and the X variable from our for Loop to recreate the shape of the flower the current position of the first petal is x equals 121 so we subtract 121 from 110 and the difference is 11. we can replace the x value with X plus 11 and this will move the petal to the same position for each flower that is created then we will repeat the steps for the other petals take a look at the code you should now have three identical flowers across the top of the afro wrapping our flowers in one for Loop and replacing the x coordinates values creates many flowers in a row from left to right but I also want them to go up and down across the yaxis of the afro this means I need to create a grid of flowers think of it like a tictactoe cord okay so that sounds gorgeous but how would I do that we can use another for Loop to add flowers in a column or up and down the yaxis so let's add another for Loop but inside the first one that represents all of our new y values for our flowers I'm going to name the variable y because we are going to replace the y coordinate in our Circle functions we can use the current yellow center of the first flower which starts at y equals 130. I want the column to stop at 450 and put a space of 130 pixels between each flower now that we moved the center of all of our flowers we are going to repeat the steps we completed previously to determine the Y values for our pink petals why don't we do that now go get to work I'll just wait here I mean working of course thank you great now you should have rows and Columns of flowers in a three by three grid on the afro if you comment out the face then you will be able to see the other two flowers behind the face next I'll add our pulsating animation to the flowers so I want the flowers to grow to a certain size then return to the same size but in the negative Direction you may be thinking right now what the heck is she talking about but I promise it's not that complicated a great example of an object moving to a certain value in the positive direction then returning to an equal value in the opposite direction is a wave when you look at waves in the ocean they move up and down the top of one wave may be 15 feet tall but the bottom of the swell may be 15 feet deep this is not dissimilar to waves in math in math waves can be represented using the sine function the sine function keeps track of the angles in a wave the angles are either moving in a positive direction or a negative direction if you look at our example wave you can see the wave increasing to one as the angle increases but once we get to 90 degrees the wave starts to decrease back down towards zero at 180 degrees then gradually towards negative one as you increase to 270 degrees then the wave turns towards the positive direction as you get closest to 360 where it starts its cycle over again at zero we can use the sine function to increase and decrease our petals to equal and opposite values so the wave is actually making our flowers pulsate how cool right above our draw flowers function let's create a variable called wave speed and set the value to zero Below Wave speed create another variable called Max diameter and set its value to 40. as the name implies we want the maximum diameter or width of our petals to be 40. now let's use these variables to create our animation inside our draw function we are going to create another variable called diam short for diameter and set its value to the following the operation works as follows every time the draw flower function runs the diam variable will multiply our sine function times the max diameter we want the petals to be now change the last value in our Circle functions to the diam remember the last value in our Circle determines the size of each circle currently if we add the diameter function then our petals don't move hmm why is that it's because the wave is set to zero so that means there is no movement in our waves remember that the sine function moves like a wave once it reaches a certain height in the positive direction then it will move to the same height or depth but in the negative direction if you put it at zero it doesn't have any direction to move in let's update the wave speed variable so that we can see our animation to do that we can reuse our favorite total sum operation by adding the total sum operation we can update the sine function wave speed value to 1. so every time the draw flowers function updates the petals move in a positive direction towards our Max diameter then returns to equal and opposite direction of the max diameter now these flowers are moving and grooving look at that now I really love this piece because I just love that it shows our big afro natural hair and the flowers just like add a really nice Beauty touch to it so drum roll please because now I can officially Crown you through another four part video series on how to code digital art with animation and queen with this honor comes great responsibility to use your skills and talents to continue making art to change the world make sure to tune in next week because we're gonna meet with a dope real life digital artist who is going to drop some knowledge on how you can turn your digital art into nfts on the blockchain so until we meet again stay cute and stay coding
