00:15 - black girls code as well as the rising
00:18 - star of the Transformers movie uh
00:21 - Dominique Fishback and so we're excited
00:23 - to have this conversation with you today
00:25 - welcome thank you I'm excited to be here
00:28 - I'll kick it off with the first question
00:30 - then I'm gonna turn it over to the
00:33 - ladies at black girls code and so uh
00:35 - Dominique if you can talk to us a little
00:37 - bit about your character uh and
00:39 - Transformers rise of the Beast
00:41 - uh well my name is Elena Wallace shout
00:44 - out to Biggie Smalls in Brooklyn she's
00:46 - from Brooklyn East New York just like me
00:48 - I'm from Brooklyn East New York uh she
00:51 - works at a museum and when you meet her
00:53 - you can tell she's really smart and good
00:55 - at her job but her boss keeps taking
00:57 - credit for the work that she does and
01:00 - then
01:01 - um she meets Noah and Autobots and uh
01:04 - she decides to like take matters into
01:06 - her own hands
01:08 - perfect I love it I love it we're joined
01:11 - by two really phenomenal uh rising stars
01:14 - in the stem space uh Madison who's based
01:17 - in New York who's been with black girls
01:18 - code so she was in the second grade and
01:21 - then Amaya is also based in in San
01:23 - Francisco and so I'm gonna turn it over
01:25 - to Madison because she has a question
01:27 - that she wants to ask you yes hi Madison
01:30 - hi Dominique I'm how excited were you to
01:33 - work on on a Transformers movie with an
01:36 - All-Star cast and director
01:39 - um I was extremely excited I think that
01:42 - originally just wanting to always wanted
01:45 - to be an actor and then watching Even
01:47 - Stevens on Disney and saying uh and then
01:50 - watching Shia go from Eva Stevens to
01:51 - Transformers and being like okay so I
01:53 - have to do something like that and I
01:56 - didn't imagine that it would actually be
01:58 - Transformers because watching it in
02:00 - these franchise a lot of times the the
02:02 - lead actress doesn't they don't look
02:04 - like us and they don't come from the
02:06 - areas that we come from a lot of the
02:08 - times so it was harder to imagine that I
02:11 - would get to take up space in that way
02:13 - for this film
02:16 - um but it I mean dreams do come true and
02:19 - I love Anthony Anthony been friends
02:22 - before the movie and I Stephen had come
02:25 - to visit my set when I was doing Judas
02:27 - in the black Messiah and I got to know
02:29 - and talk to him and one of their main
02:31 - reasons why I wanted to be a part of the
02:33 - franchise is because of Steven's vision
02:35 - and his uh his commitment to making sure
02:39 - that Elena had her own storyline her own
02:41 - arc and that she was an individual with
02:44 - her own dreams and that was important to
02:46 - me
02:47 - for returning it over to you Amaya
02:51 - um so what was your favorite moment
02:53 - during production
02:55 - oh
02:57 - uh during production uh my I think my
03:01 - favorite moment is going to Machu Picchu
03:03 - and Peru and it's sacred you know sacred
03:06 - land and they had a shaman blessed
03:09 - production for being on the land and
03:11 - while we were in a ceremony a butterfly
03:13 - flew in a butterflies are really sacred
03:16 - to me I felt like my grandmother comes
03:18 - to visit me YouTube
03:20 - yes that's beautiful me as well yeah
03:23 - yeah it's awesome so you're gonna love
03:25 - this story so my I also felt like my
03:27 - grandmother comes to visit me and
03:28 - butterflies and let me know that I'm
03:29 - safe and then I'm on the right track and
03:31 - a butterfly came and landed in the
03:33 - middle of the ceremony and stayed there
03:35 - for the entire ceremony for like 15
03:37 - minutes in that same spot after the
03:40 - ceremony I go and lay on the grass with
03:42 - the butterfly and I'm eye to eye with
03:44 - this butterfly and I'm laying there and
03:46 - then I put my finger out and it hops to
03:48 - another piece of grass and then I put my
03:50 - finger over there and after about seven
03:52 - minutes of me sitting like this patience
03:54 - is a virtue I never thought I had it but
03:56 - apparently I do I sat there in the
03:58 - butterfly I saw it the butterfly stepped
04:00 - one leg on my finger and then the other
04:03 - and I lifted it up like this and it's
04:05 - all on videos actually on my Instagram
04:07 - right now if you want to check it out
04:08 - but after the obviously after the
04:10 - interview but that was such a beautiful
04:12 - experience and I thought oh this is a
04:13 - good idea and now it's 333 on the clock
04:16 - and that's also a good sign so hey we in
04:19 - there hang in the money
04:21 - I love that story that was like so
04:24 - amazing and I relate to it so much so I
04:27 - like I'm definitely gonna check that out
04:29 - right after this my next question is who
04:32 - is your favorite Autobot in the movie
04:35 - oh in the movie in this movie or in
04:38 - Transformers World in this movie but
04:42 - then also tell us in the Transformers
04:43 - world because I need to know I need to
04:45 - know bumblebee is my favorite just all
04:49 - all over just from the beat the first
04:52 - one and his uh relationship with the
04:54 - humans and his sincerity and his love
04:56 - he's just he's like he's always going to
04:58 - be a fan favorite I I do believe that in
05:01 - this movie Mirage is just so Dynamic and
05:03 - Pete Davidson voice him so uh like
05:07 - amazing funny charismatic sincere you
05:11 - just love I think you look you just fall
05:13 - in love with Mirage
05:15 - um but B is always going to be B at the
05:17 - end of the day mm-hmm
05:24 - all right is it me I'm asking a question
05:26 - yeah yeah you're the same question go
05:28 - ahead all right
05:30 - um
05:32 - when you're like not acting what do you
05:35 - do for fun like
05:37 - uh I like to read a lot but I read books
05:41 - that are like I'm reading a book called
05:44 - um a return to Love by Marianne
05:47 - Williamson she's the one with the quote
05:49 - uh that says our deepest fear is not
05:51 - that we are inadequate our deepest fear
05:53 - is that we are powerful beyond measure
05:55 - is I lighten out our darkness that most
05:57 - frightens us and I remember in 11th
05:59 - grade my I came into my teacher in my
06:01 - English teacher's classroom one day and
06:03 - she had that quote right above the the
06:05 - board and I was like oh I feel that
06:08 - that's special to me I didn't know it
06:09 - came from that book returned to love but
06:11 - the book is really beautiful and it's
06:13 - just helping me on my journey to one be
06:16 - more compassionate to myself and as you
06:18 - as I'm a compassionate myself I'm able
06:20 - to be more compassionate to others and
06:22 - see others as human as learning as
06:25 - growing as I am and uh yes it's been fun
06:28 - otherwise I I learned I love piano
06:31 - I've been playing piano a bit I'm
06:33 - learning guitar right now but I'm
06:34 - definitely better at piano I love spoken
06:38 - word and working on a poetry book
06:40 - uh and I want to do music so that's what
06:43 - I'm doing for fun uh figuring out also
06:46 - my femininity I feel like because I'm
06:48 - from New York there's always been like a
06:51 - like a masculine type of energy that I
06:53 - thought that I had and I felt I didn't
06:55 - have access to that soft feminine type
06:58 - and now I'm I was navigating how to find
07:01 - it how to how to have more access to it
07:03 - so it's been a hard journey but it's
07:05 - been really fun too to explore all the
07:09 - uh aspects of myself
07:12 - wow that is super interesting and I'm
07:15 - from I'm from New York as well and I
07:17 - love to read as well so you should
07:18 - definitely check out the lip bar 10 out

07:28 - amazing yes I love it there and speaking
07:31 - of music what are your favorite songs
07:32 - featured in the movie and who are your
07:34 - top two favorite artists and why
07:37 - oh it's a hard one I know uh favorite
07:40 - song in the movie uh hypnotized biggie
07:45 - yeah just like when you hear that beat
07:47 - like it's just some just go crazy and
07:50 - then I have to say I really love Toby's
07:53 - song with nas
07:56 - um
07:56 - uh on my soul that's an original for the
07:59 - film and then

08:20 - yikes
08:23 - Michael Jackson like uh those were the
08:27 - two artists that I had on my my wall the
08:29 - most growing up so I have to pick them
08:31 - even though I love Lauren Hill as well
08:35 - especially her uh MTV Unplugged album I
08:38 - don't know if you heard that one
08:39 - yes that's actually my favorite my
08:42 - favorite song is Adam Liz in theory yeah
08:44 - I love I get out yeah but uh so in terms
08:48 - of music like I want to do something
08:49 - that pays homage to that album
08:55 - um what are like three words how would
08:58 - you describe Transformers in three words
09:03 - black uh
09:08 - funny
09:10 - endearing
09:13 - those are some good words yeah thank you
09:18 - uh Dominic steam is a huge part of the
09:21 - storyline and DNA of Transformers which
09:23 - is exciting because that's the epitome
09:26 - of black girls code uh how different was
09:30 - the role versus other characters you've
09:32 - played
09:33 - oh yes
09:35 - um well I've never played a scientist
09:37 - before artifact researcher
09:40 - um and that was def that was completely
09:42 - different from anything that I've ever
09:44 - done just getting a language in my mouth
09:46 - as well but also just making sure that
09:48 - that
09:50 - I didn't um
09:52 - like a assimilate like I didn't change
09:55 - my my voice and how I how I speak like
09:58 - my characters from Brooklyn she's from
09:59 - East New York and just because she's a
10:01 - scientist I didn't want to put on a
10:04 - voice you know be like oh you know like
10:07 - there's a certain way she still is like
10:09 - yo for real like what's up with that
10:11 - like what took you so long to the to the
10:14 - security I wanted her to be able to you
10:16 - know Nubian and like keep the harshness
10:18 - New York on her voice and show that you
10:21 - can there's many ways to be a woman in
10:24 - science in many ways to be intelligent
10:27 - um even though we've been told for a
10:29 - long time that there's a certain way
10:30 - that you have to speak a certain way
10:32 - certain things you have to wear certain
10:34 - way you have to look you know in order
10:36 - to see be seen deemed professional and
10:40 - I'm so glad that you know Stephen
10:42 - honored her natural hair the curls and
10:45 - like especially as you get in the jungle
10:47 - gets fluffier and fluffier ah and then
10:50 - just the lipstick that she got to wear
10:52 - uh you know because because also she's a
10:55 - she's a fly she's a fly scientist you
10:57 - know what I mean she got swag and
10:59 - lipstick and suspenders and look really
11:01 - cool uh yeah
11:04 - perfect in the last two minutes we have
11:06 - left Madison or Amaya do you have any
11:08 - last questions yes I have another
11:11 - question for you so I'm 15 and I'm
11:13 - curious on what advice you would give to
11:16 - your 15 year old so
11:18 - honestly this might sound cliche but I I
11:21 - would tell her that she actually has all
11:23 - the answers
11:25 - um that she has it she truly does have
11:27 - it inside herself and I would just say
11:30 - when you feel like you don't know
11:33 - Satan in silence and write it out just
11:36 - right anything that comes to your mind
11:38 - write it out and then by the end of
11:40 - writing it out maybe right for 20
11:42 - minutes and by the end of writing it out
11:44 - you'll find that all of the egoic and uh
11:48 - societal pressures and ideas and ideals
11:52 - that are not really true to you that
11:53 - don't resonate that they will they will
11:55 - lift up for a little while and then you
11:57 - can grab the stuff that's underneath it
11:59 - so that's actually how I feel about it
12:01 - and you'll realize the next day that
12:03 - stuff will come back on and you're like
12:04 - oh man I gotta do it again you know I'm
12:07 - saying you grab the stuff that matters
12:08 - and slowly but surely you'll start to be
12:10 - like oh I don't have as much on top of
12:13 - what I really feel I actually can go
12:15 - right there and pick it out like this I
12:17 - don't have to scrape everything to grab
12:19 - I can just like it's incision and just
12:21 - go poop right so it starts to to get uh
12:24 - to get like that so I would just tell
12:25 - her that she has the answers inside of
12:27 - her when she doesn't know write it out
12:29 - or meditate you know uh
12:33 - just laying quiet and see and then after
12:36 - that before in 2020 I started doing this
12:38 - thing where uh if I had anxiety about
12:41 - anything I would write it down I would
12:44 - write first Journal Journal I always
12:46 - journal and she did the journey since I
12:48 - was 12. so
12:49 - um but I would journal and then I would
12:51 - meditate
12:52 - and then after I would meditate I would
12:54 - Journal again and I find that the things
12:56 - that I said before the meditation they
12:58 - were all about they were based in fear
13:00 - and fair future that doesn't have to
13:02 - happen you know all these things that
13:04 - that didn't make me feel good but when I
13:06 - was meditating that's the closest I got
13:08 - to being still and being near sauce
13:10 - being their God and then oh oh my god
13:13 - wow this is there's so much levity in
13:15 - how I feel now
13:17 - nice I love it thank you so much for
13:20 - that I really appreciate that I'm
13:21 - definitely going to take that I
13:23 - definitely want to start journaling more
13:24 - so this I feel like this was my sign yes
13:26 - it was thank you so much because I'm
13:28 - gonna send you pictures I'm like that
13:30 - sounds weird but I'm gonna be like weird
13:32 - it's not weird in fact like I just uh
13:35 - lines be yourself love and I had a
13:37 - tattoo is in my mom's hair right and be
13:39 - yourself love because I realize that
13:40 - coming into Hollywood or going into any
13:42 - space it can be hard sometimes to to
13:45 - speak how you feel to laugh how you
13:48 - laugh to joke how you joke and I think
13:50 - it's important to be yourself and be
13:52 - loved and I'm actually making my own
13:54 - journals be yourself Journal uh that's
13:57 - going to come out when Transformers
13:58 - comes out and it'll be on my Instagram
14:00 - so no it's and I think it is a sign and
14:02 - it's a sign for me to continue to like
14:05 - uh do other things outside of acting
14:08 - because you don't know who it can help
14:09 - or Inspire so thank you on that note be
14:14 - yourself love is how we're going to end
14:15 - this conversation thank you so much
14:17 - pouring into the thousands of girls that

Transformers because watching it in these franchise a lot of times the the lead actress doesn't they don't look like us and they don't come from the areas that we come from a lot of the times so it was harder to imagine that I would get to take up space in that way for this film um but it I mean dreams do come true and I love Anthony Anthony been friends before the movie and I Stephen had come to visit my set when I was doing Judas in the black Messiah and I got to know and talk to him and one of their main reasons why I wanted to be a part of the franchise is because of Steven's vision and

so what was your favorite moment during production oh uh during production uh my I think my favorite moment is going to Machu Picchu and Peru and it's sacred you know sacred land and they had a shaman

right track and a butterfly came and landed in the middle of the ceremony and stayed there for the entire ceremony for like 15 minutes in that same spot after the ceremony I go and lay on the grass with the butterfly and I'm eye to eye with this butterfly and I'm laying there and then I put my finger out and it hops to another piece of grass and then I put my finger over there and after about seven minutes of me sitting like this patience is a virtue I never thought I had it but apparently I do I sat there in the butterfly I saw it the butterfly stepped one leg on my finger and then the other and I lifted it up like this and it's all on videos actually on my Instagram right now if you want to check it out but after the obviously after the interview but that was such a beautiful

those are some good words yeah thank you uh Dominic steam is a huge part of the storyline and DNA of Transformers which is exciting because that's the epitome of black girls code uh how different was the role versus other characters you've played oh yes um well I've never played a scientist before artifact researcher um and that was def that was completely different from anything that I've ever done just getting a language in my mouth as well but also just making sure that that I didn't um like a assimilate like I didn't change my my voice and how I how I speak like my characters from Brooklyn she's from East New York and just because she's a scientist I didn't want to put on a voice you know be like oh you know like there's a certain way she still is like yo for real like what's up with that like what took you so long to the to the security I wanted her to be able to you know Nubian and like keep the harshness New York on her voice and show that you can there's many ways to be a woman in science in many ways to be intelligent um even though we've been told for a long time that there's a certain way that you have to speak a certain way certain things you have to wear certain way you have to look you know in order to see be seen deemed professional and I'm so glad that you know Stephen honored her natural hair the curls and like especially as you get in the jungle gets fluffier and fluffier ah and then just the lipstick that she got to wear uh you know because because also she's a she's a fly she's a fly scientist you know what I mean she got swag and lipstick and suspenders and look really cool uh yeah perfect in the last two minutes we have left Madison or Amaya do you have any last questions yes I have another question for you so I'm 15 and I'm curious on what advice you would give to your 15 year old so honestly this might sound cliche but I I would tell her that she actually has all the answers um that she has it she truly does have it inside herself and I would just say when you feel like you don't know Satan in silence and write it out just right anything that comes to your mind write it out and then by the end of writing it out maybe right for 20 minutes and by the end of writing it out you'll find that all of the egoic and uh societal pressures and ideas and ideals that are not really true to you that don't resonate that they will they will lift up for a little while and then you can grab the stuff that's underneath it so that's actually how I feel about it and you'll realize the next day that stuff will come back on and you're like oh man I gotta do it again you know I'm saying you grab the stuff that matters and slowly but surely you'll start to be like oh I don't have as much on top of what I really feel I actually can go right there and pick it out like this I don't have to scrape everything to grab I can just like it's incision and just go poop right so it starts to to get uh to get like that so I would just tell her that she has the answers inside of her when she doesn't know write it out or meditate you know uh just laying quiet and see and then after that before in 2020 I started doing this thing where uh if I had anxiety about anything I would write it down I would write first Journal Journal I always journal and she did the journey since I was 12. so um but I would journal and then I would meditate and then after I would meditate I would Journal again and I find that the things that I said before the meditation they were all about they were based in fear and fair future that doesn't have to happen you know all these things that that didn't make me feel good but when I was meditating that's the closest I got to being still and being near sauce being their God and then oh oh my god wow this is there's so much levity in how I feel now nice I love it thank you so much for that I really appreciate that I'm definitely going to take that I definitely want to start journaling more so this I feel like this was my sign yes it was thank you so much because I'm gonna send you pictures I'm like that sounds weird but I'm gonna be like weird it's not weird in fact like I just uh lines be yourself love and I had a tattoo is in my mom's hair right and be yourself love because I realize that coming into Hollywood or going into any space it can be hard sometimes to to speak how you feel to laugh how you laugh to joke how you joke and I think it's important to be yourself and be loved and I'm actually making my own journals be yourself Journal uh that's going to come out when Transformers comes out and it'll be on my Instagram so no it's and I think it is a sign and it's a sign for me to continue to like uh do other things outside of acting because you don't know who it can help or Inspire so thank you on that note be yourself love is how we're going to end this conversation thank you so much pouring into the thousands of girls that are innovators dreamers Visionaries scientists um within their Journey with black girls code thank you to Madison as well as Amaya and again thank you so much Dominique for the work that you're doing with this with this film and everything that you're doing overall thank you for your time and thank you everyone thank you for having me see you guys later bye
