00:00 - okay guys I know my gamers are going to
00:02 - love this next guest the Sola alugbin is
00:05 - a software engineer for the content
00:07 - support team on the game valorent day in
00:10 - and day out she is troubleshooting
00:12 - issues to make sure your gaming
00:13 - experience continues to be top tier
00:16 - [Music]
00:24 - how are you good how are you I'm great
00:27 - thank you so we're going to play Jenga
00:29 - to get to know you better today
00:31 - basically each one of us will remove one
00:33 - block from the tower and place it on top
00:35 - of the tower if it collapses then that
00:37 - round of the game is over and we'll
00:39 - start again as you can see the tower has
00:41 - four different colors each color
00:43 - represents a theme so when you pull a
00:45 - specific colored block you have to
00:46 - answer the question from that color
00:48 - theme the color themes include purple
00:50 - for childhood memories red for career
00:52 - green for inspiration and blue for a
00:55 - challenge
00:56 - are you ready to get started yeah let's
00:58 - go go
00:59 - for a tough one here
01:04 - [Music]
01:07 - so that was amazing
01:11 - you have to play professional Jenga is
01:13 - that a thing
01:14 - I don't mean to brag
01:16 - yes oh my gosh okay purple childhood
01:20 - memories
01:21 - describe how you became a game developer
01:24 - did you go to college or a university
01:25 - what major did you study and why did you
01:28 - choose that major as a kid
01:31 - my dad one day brought home an N64 for
01:35 - me and my older sister and said um here
01:37 - you go here's some games so we started
01:39 - to play those we played a lot of
01:40 - multiplayer games we'd go to our friends
01:42 - houses and play those too and I always
01:43 - thought games are really cool I would
01:45 - like to do that in the future I went to
01:48 - the University of Pennsylvania and I was
01:51 - originally an electrical engineer and I
01:54 - thought you know what lightsabers are so
01:55 - cool I would like to build one of those
01:57 - one day and then I thought you know what
01:59 - would be really cool and also maybe more
02:01 - immediately attainable in the near
02:03 - future would be to work on a game with
02:06 - lights
02:08 - and so uh I actually switched to
02:11 - computer science I minored in Fine Art
02:14 - so I could get sort of a background
02:16 - about how artists do things and so a lot
02:19 - of my career has been helping build
02:20 - tools so that artists can do what they
02:23 - need to do to to work on a commercial or
02:27 - create a movie or where I am now which
02:30 - is create a lot of cool new content new
02:32 - characters for Valor
02:35 - oh
02:37 - nope
02:41 - wow
02:43 - oh my god well there we go all right
02:47 - guys we are back after I knocked the
02:49 - tower down but I'm Gonna Let You Go
02:52 - though because I'm traumatized from that
02:53 - last night I'll give it my best shot
02:55 - yeah I trust you
02:58 - yes yeah
03:00 - alrighty career okay what is a software
03:04 - engineer so as a software engineer
03:07 - especially in the content support team
03:08 - we have a a lot of different features
03:12 - that we might want to build out for the
03:15 - content developers so let's say in one
03:17 - case
03:18 - um they might ask how do we make a uh a
03:23 - sound that we play sort of uh have a
03:26 - visualization on uh the gun skin that we
03:30 - have the answer might be well we don't
03:31 - know yet but let's figure it out and so
03:34 - for that part of that is me saying okay
03:36 - well I'm going to go into the code and
03:38 - I'm going to grab those values from our
03:42 - sound engine and I'm going to make sure
03:44 - that there's that's something that a
03:46 - designer might be able to use to drive a
03:50 - visualization within the game that they
03:53 - need so there's bugs but sometimes
03:55 - there's features that we need to build
03:57 - out and sometimes a bug is a feature
04:00 - and uh there's there's just a large
04:02 - scope of things that pop up there when
04:05 - it comes to programming you you discover
04:08 - that there was just a whole underlying
04:10 - part of the code base that you you you
04:13 - take a new look at and you go well maybe
04:15 - we can change this or
04:18 - um fix it or optimize it make it run
04:22 - better or faster than it was before and
04:27 - just in general sort of uh
04:30 - update things so that uh the players can
04:35 - experience the game the best possible
04:37 - way wow
04:38 - that's interesting sometimes you go you
04:39 - go to something and you think you're
04:41 - going to fix one thing and then you end
04:42 - up fixing a bunch of things absolutely I
04:45 - know that all too well
04:47 - alrighty oh man I'm scared okay I'm just
04:50 - gonna do it I'm just gonna do it
04:52 - I'm just gonna do it oh you did it okay
04:55 - childhood memories what are some
04:57 - programs that helped you develop games
04:59 - when you were younger and what are some
05:01 - tools that you would recommend today
05:03 - when I was a kid me and my older sister
05:05 - would always use RPG Maker to make some
05:09 - small games there and what's cool about
05:12 - RPG Maker is that it can sort of help
05:14 - you learn how to code and that it'll
05:17 - give you little logic statements like if
05:20 - this then that and you can start to
05:23 - build really cool and smart systems by
05:27 - just saying if this then that or for
05:30 - each of these things do that and that's
05:34 - a really cool way to get started and RPG
05:36 - Maker still exists today Unity is out
05:39 - there and it's freely available I hear
05:42 - that people are making very cool things
05:44 - in Roblox and in Minecraft I would
05:47 - totally recommend those unreal is also
05:49 - free it's a little more complicated kid
05:52 - but I think it's also cool because you
05:54 - can hop into it and use blueprints to
05:57 - move and create new content that way you
06:01 - can also start to learn how to program
06:03 - and then build larger systems based off
06:06 - of that too RPG Maker is a great start
06:08 - it still exists and things like a game
06:11 - maker
06:13 - were around when I was a kid and are
06:16 - really still being used today so those
06:18 - are also awesome as well oh okay oh it's
06:21 - your turn oh I will talk forever
06:26 - no it's okay that last career oh that's
06:30 - a great choice
06:33 - wow wow so smooth that was very smooth
06:36 - wow
06:37 - all righty do you use code to create
06:40 - games and what are the programs you use
06:42 - on a daily basis I do use code to create
06:45 - games the cool thing about code and
06:48 - programming is that once you learn one
06:50 - thing you sort of got the basics for a
06:53 - lot of different uh programming
06:56 - languages on a day-to-day basis I use C
06:58 - plus plus and I'm using visual studio
07:01 - but you can use a different Editor to be
07:03 - able to edit your code I also on
07:06 - occasion might use Python because we
07:08 - built some tools out uh for a modeling
07:11 - program Maya for a lot of the animators
07:14 - or the modelers all of this sort of
07:16 - feeds back into unreal which is what
07:18 - valorent is built in there's just a lot
07:20 - of different programs that people can
07:22 - can take a look at and learn find
07:25 - Opportunities like on a YouTube or or
07:29 - different places to learn how to
07:31 - um a code there's a lot of different
07:33 - resources that people can look into no I
07:36 - love that that's great yeah and you
07:38 - heard what she said resources so
07:39 - remember to watch our videos okay
07:42 - cool
07:44 - ah
07:46 - okay I'm gonna take a look
07:48 - I'm just gonna go for it I'm just gonna
07:49 - go for it
07:51 - oh my God I knew that was gonna happen
07:54 - miss you have been such a pleasure thank
07:57 - you so much for all the information that
07:59 - you've provided us and just thank you
08:01 - for being you and doing what you do and
08:03 - Making Waves in the industry thank you
08:05 - so much for having me all right guys
08:07 - that's all we have for you guys today
08:08 - thank you so much for watching and have
08:11 - a good one
08:12 - [Music]
08:20 - thank you
