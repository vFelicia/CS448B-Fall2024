00:34 - each of us will remove one of these
00:35 - blocks and place it at the top of the
00:37 - tower making it crumble if it crumbles
00:39 - that round of the game is over and
00:41 - another one begins as you see the tower
00:43 - has four different colors each color
00:45 - represents a theme when you pull a
00:47 - specific colored block you will have to
00:49 - answer the question from that color
00:50 - theme the color themes include purple
00:52 - for childhood memories red for career
00:54 - green for inspiration and blue for a
00:57 - challenge let's get started alright

01:01 - yeah
01:02 - this one is calling me
01:04 - we did that so smoothly thank you let me
01:07 - put it on top right now okay don't
01:09 - forget okay inspiration our storyboards
01:13 - involved in the game design process or
01:16 - do developers work with a storyboard
01:17 - artist yes so much anytime that you're
01:20 - making something in a 3D virtual or
01:23 - Digital World you have to know like what
01:25 - are you actually making what does the
01:27 - world look like what are the story beats
01:29 - and that could be as simple as stick
01:31 - figures you know like I know plenty
01:33 - people they're not great artists but
01:34 - they're really good storytellers so
01:36 - their storyboard might literally be text
01:38 - of stories we work with story artists
01:40 - all the time and storyboards are so
01:43 - important to making any sort of like
01:45 - video game or digital experience okay
01:47 - this one's calling my name though got it
01:49 - you got this yeah there we go okay
01:54 - top there cool
01:56 - inspiration for Roblox game creators how
02:00 - should they get their games to the top
02:02 - of the charts you know this is kind of
02:04 - tough to hear you you almost can't
02:06 - concentrate that on that and again if
02:08 - you keep making games the more that
02:10 - you're going to learn and if you keep
02:12 - making like new types of digital
02:13 - experiences like your skills are going
02:15 - to grow you're going to learn more about
02:16 - like how to keep your audience happy in
02:19 - the long run and that is going to lead
02:21 - to better retention and getting you
02:23 - towards the top of the chart right but
02:25 - you really just got to concentrate like
02:26 - is it something that you yourself want
02:29 - to go and spend time in and then worry
02:31 - about that first yeah I love that it's
02:33 - definitely a marathon not a race yeah
02:35 - exactly definitely all right
02:38 - beautiful here
02:40 - all right
02:43 - um
02:43 - getting a little crazy it is getting
02:45 - crazy that's the whole point of Jenga I
02:48 - changed my mind okay
02:53 - [Music]
02:56 - you have 10 seconds again all right list
02:59 - careers of those interested in gaming
03:01 - and Tech
03:02 - so we got all kinds of different
03:03 - engineers get ux designers you got
03:06 - people who are making the back ends you
03:07 - got people who are matchmaking getting
03:09 - people together you got artists you got
03:11 - artists or you're making sounds you've
03:13 - got people who are working on
03:14 - accessibility to make sure everyone can
03:16 - play it and that's 10 seconds so okay
03:18 - that was so many though that was so good
03:20 - wow there's there's careers for
03:22 - everybody in game design I love that and
03:24 - that in itself is a story all right
03:28 - oh okay
03:31 - I keep going for the ones on the
03:32 - opposite side and I know you're so brave
03:35 - [Music]
03:36 - I can't I can't give up oh gosh that was
03:39 - scary it's getting scarier
03:42 - okay this one is a career card okay
03:44 - ready what'd you go all right
03:47 - tell us about the process of creating a
03:49 - game in Roblox so the first thing that
03:51 - we do is we really figure out what
03:53 - what's it all about what do we want
03:54 - people to come away with it could be
03:56 - something like we want them to
03:57 - understand like how to make a variable
03:59 - or it could be if you're making a spooky
04:02 - game you want them to come away with
04:03 - that feeling of like you know like fear
04:05 - and tension or you want them to have
04:06 - happiness and like be stress relief
04:08 - you're gonna go farm something right so
04:10 - you kind of figure out like what is that
04:11 - that feeling and what the story that you
04:13 - want to make and then from there we
04:15 - start just like spitballing like okay
04:17 - what could it look like so really kind
04:19 - of like figuring out what's the setting
04:20 - and what we want people to come away
04:21 - with and then we start storyboarding
04:23 - things we start drawing it on paper to
04:25 - reference what we want things to look
04:26 - like and then you're gonna make sure
04:28 - that you're getting people to take a
04:29 - look at it getting people to play it you
04:31 - want to make sure like if they were
04:32 - actually getting what you want out of it
04:34 - and you need to get that from a wide
04:36 - audience
04:37 - it's just so that's a big screen
04:42 - we can play like a mini Jenga
04:45 - we're back with the new tower We're Not
04:47 - Gonna knock it down this time we will
04:49 - eventually we probably will but okay all
04:51 - right
04:52 - um okay
04:56 - all right all right
04:58 - almost I was I was so scared I was very
05:00 - no I didn't want to I didn't want to
05:01 - talk
05:02 - oh right okay remix what is the biggest
05:07 - challenge you have as a woman in this
05:09 - evolving gaming entertainment space
05:13 - how have you overcome it and you have to
05:16 - sort of like balance like
05:19 - being a woman in the game industry and
05:22 - being a role model and really trying to
05:25 - respect the communities and the people
05:26 - who held open doors for you
05:29 - so now you have to go hold open doors
05:30 - for people behind you and that that took
05:33 - me a while to understand because I just
05:35 - wanted to come in and make things I
05:37 - didn't want to be asked about it I just
05:39 - wanted to like do the thing and then I I
05:42 - started thinking about
05:43 - like all those people who came before me
05:46 - and I I wouldn't be here without that
05:48 - and so I think like it's so important
05:49 - for me to do things like this to come
05:51 - and talk to you and like come and like
05:53 - do these experiences so people can see
05:55 - like what an amazing job and career this
05:57 - could be but it can be a lot to
05:59 - sometimes have to balance being a role
06:02 - model and like supporting your community
06:04 - and supporting your family while trying
06:06 - to make the things that you want to make
06:09 - your choice I keep going to go I'm gonna
06:11 - go for the the oh nope
06:16 - [Music]
06:21 - put right in the center
06:23 - wiggled good oh okay oh yeah okay
06:26 - beautiful all righty oh this is
06:29 - childhood memories by the way guys
06:31 - okay what tools would you recommend to
06:35 - younger viewers wanting to create their
06:37 - own game
06:38 - there's there's so much it's really
06:40 - whatever tools you have you can use
06:43 - there's obviously like software I
06:46 - mentioned Maya if you have access to
06:48 - things like Roblox Studio obviously I'm
06:50 - super biased and I think everyone should
06:51 - make Roblox games because you make
06:53 - whatever you want and it's you know free
06:54 - but if you if you have access to
06:56 - Minecraft or scratch or unreal or if you
07:00 - have access to paper and pencil like you
07:02 - can make really cool like pen paper like
07:05 - board games actually professionally when
07:06 - you go to school for video game design a
07:08 - lot of times the first thing they have
07:09 - you do is literally make paper and
07:12 - pencil games yeah so they like take a
07:15 - step back from the computer and see what
07:16 - you can do in real life the important
07:18 - thing is just start making things yeah
07:20 - so are we done
07:21 - um yeah that's all the questions I have
07:23 - for you okay I was like scared I think
07:26 - this part of it is still like no you
07:27 - can't knock it out it's like all right
07:29 - no give it one more push one more good
07:30 - push you got it there we go
