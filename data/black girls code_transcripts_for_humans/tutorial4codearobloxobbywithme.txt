00:00 - hey hey gaming family I'm your host
00:03 - Cheyenne and I'm excited to welcome you
00:05 - back to video 4 of code along in this
00:08 - video we'll be learning how to add and
00:11 - edit scripts to objects which will allow
00:13 - us to customize actions and effects in
00:16 - our game we will also be building level
00:18 - 3 of our Obby the contaminated ocean so
00:22 - let's dive into Roblox well maybe not
00:25 - dive because you know get it dirty ocean
00:28 - water
00:29 - [Music]
00:38 - closed out of Roblox studio and need to
00:40 - find your hobby then go to file open
00:43 - from Roblox and choose your game
00:46 - in the previous videos we added objects
00:49 - from our Marketplace to our Avi each
00:51 - object was unique because of scripts
00:54 - written into the object allow the
00:56 - Creator to add custom actions and
00:59 - effects let's learn how to customize our
01:01 - objects through scripts first I will
01:04 - need to build out level three a bit to
01:06 - make it look like the contaminated ocean
01:08 - here's the vision I was going for
01:13 - to represent our ocean today let's copy
01:16 - our floor from level two and paste it
01:19 - side by side to create level three
01:21 - rename the floor in the Explorer to the
01:24 - polluted ocean
01:28 - [Applause]
01:30 - I'm going to change the color in the
01:32 - property screen to a reddish brown to
01:35 - show that the water is dirty but you can
01:37 - choose any color you'd like
01:39 - so how are we going to pass from Level 3
01:42 - to level four oh
01:46 - I know let's add a secret pathway that
01:50 - we can navigate through and since we
01:52 - have an unhealthy ocean we're not going
01:54 - to show any animals here why don't we
01:56 - instead design it so that the player has
01:58 - to jump from trash pile to trash pile to
02:00 - cross let's start simple with a single
02:03 - block part then make it more complex in
02:05 - the later levels select the block part
02:07 - and rename it to secret block one
02:10 - [Music]
02:19 - I want the trash pile to appear then
02:22 - disappear if it appears then we should
02:24 - be able to jump on it but as soon as it
02:27 - disappears we'll fall into the ocean
02:28 - like that floor is lava game you know
02:30 - we're like
02:32 - don't touch the floor but the ocean
02:34 - right now let's add our script if you
02:38 - hover over the object a plus sign will
02:40 - appear next to the name click the plus
02:43 - sign and a drop down menu will appear
02:45 - type in script and choose the first
02:48 - option you should now see a script icon
02:51 - under secret block one also when you
02:54 - create a new script a script tab will
02:56 - open next to your base plate the new
02:59 - script will have a default code saying
03:01 - prints parentheses hello world
03:03 - parentheses oh well that's nice but I
03:06 - have to delete it sadly okay hi bye
03:11 - now let's rename our script to fade
03:13 - block because we want the block to fade
03:15 - in and out
03:18 - it's time to start writing our code
03:20 - inside the fade block script I want to
03:23 - create a variable in Roblox variables
03:25 - are names associated with values think
03:28 - of it this way we have a filing cabinet
03:31 - in here you know that big clinky heavy
03:33 - metal drawer your parents probably have
03:35 - in their office in our virtual filing
03:37 - cabinet each drawer would be a variable
03:39 - that can hold various things such as
03:41 - text numbers and objects the name or
03:45 - label outside each drawer tells you
03:47 - what's inside the drawer or what the
03:49 - variable contains because we're working
03:51 - on the first secret block or secret
03:54 - block 1 we'll name the variable or the
03:56 - folder in our filing cabinet example
03:58 - secret block now this will store the
04:01 - object the script is located in as its
04:04 - value in our case the script is located
04:06 - in the secret block 1 object doing this
04:10 - will allow us to select and edit the
04:12 - object and local means we want to use
04:15 - the variable only on this script
04:17 - now that we can edit the secret block
04:19 - one object let's add the action to make
04:22 - the block disappear I'll use a function
04:24 - which declares an action on the object
04:27 - this means it will give instructions on
04:29 - what action we want to happen to the
04:31 - object the action we want is to make the
04:33 - block disappear each function name is
04:36 - followed by a parenthesis and the
04:38 - function stops at the end let's give our
04:40 - function instructions on what we want to
04:42 - disappear inside of your function let's
04:45 - grab the transparency property from the
04:48 - secret block 1 object
04:50 - the properties of the objects are
04:52 - located below the Explorer it is
04:55 - currently set to zero transparency which
04:57 - means we can see it transparency is on a
05:00 - scale from zero to one with one being
05:02 - invisible to start the action we created
05:05 - we'll write it below the initial
05:07 - function except without the words local
05:09 - function
05:09 - [Music]
05:15 - let's see if our disappearing function
05:17 - worked go ahead and press play
05:22 - whoa
05:25 - wait wait wait wait wait wait wait am I
05:27 - disappearing hold on wait what's going
05:29 - on hold on wait I don't like this I
05:31 - don't like this where where are my toes
05:33 - if it worked then the block will be
05:35 - invisible if you walk over to where the
05:37 - block should be it's still there you
05:39 - can't see it but you can still run into
05:41 - it
05:45 - hey you did that okay looks like the
05:48 - script worked because the block turns
05:50 - invisible let's write another function
05:52 - called appear below the disappear
05:54 - function
05:58 - I'm going to select and change the
06:00 - transparency property back to zero great
06:03 - now the block is visible then select the
06:06 - can Collide property which controls
06:08 - whether or not the player can collide
06:10 - with or touch an object we can set it to
06:12 - false when the block disappears and true
06:15 - when it reappears that means the player
06:17 - is able to collide with the block when
06:19 - it appears allowing them to jump on it
06:21 - but if it's not there then they will
06:23 - fall into the ocean and
06:26 - game over not over over you know they'll
06:30 - restart at the last checkpoint The
06:32 - Disappearing block is cool and all but
06:36 - I want to make it even more challenging
06:40 - I want to set a timer that will
06:43 - determine how long the block stays
06:46 - visible so I'll control when the block
06:48 - appears and disappears I know it's so
06:51 - evil to do this let's set a timer we can
06:55 - use something called a while loop a
06:57 - while loop Loops through a block of code
06:59 - as long as its specified condition is
07:01 - true we will also use a built-in weight
07:04 - function which takes a number
07:06 - representing how many seconds you want
07:08 - to wait before you go to the next
07:09 - function so I want to Loop over the
07:12 - disappear and appear functions so while
07:14 - my for Loop is true I'll do this wait
07:17 - for five seconds make the block
07:19 - disappear then wait another five seconds
07:22 - and it reappears
07:24 - that's it now press play
07:27 - [Music]
07:36 - look at that we created a disappearing
07:39 - secret trash block trash block maybe I
07:42 - shouldn't be as excited for that as I am
07:44 - now that we have one secret Block it's
07:47 - time to create a pathway across the
07:49 - ocean you can make some of the blocks
07:50 - invisible but make it so you can still
07:52 - jump on them you can also make other
07:54 - blocks visible but you'll fall through
07:56 - this makes it super super tricky for our
07:59 - player they will never know what they're
08:01 - gonna get the level of trickiness
08:04 - is up to you excellent we've added our
08:07 - own custom script to an object but what
08:10 - if we wanted to add a script already
08:12 - created by someone else
08:14 - actually make the process even easier
08:16 - let's try it by adding a kill script to
08:19 - the ocean floor I know I know the name
08:22 - is not as PG friendly as we would all
08:24 - like but it's just what it's called if
08:26 - the player falls into the contaminated
08:28 - ocean then game over not over over as
08:32 - you already know go back to the
08:34 - marketplace then search for the kill
08:36 - script and select the first option
08:40 - foreign
08:41 - go to the Explorer and rename the script
08:44 - to kill script
08:46 - [Music]
08:51 - then drag and drop it into the polluted
08:54 - Ocean Park
08:59 - [Music]
09:04 - now press play and test out whether you
09:06 - can cross the ocean or not
09:09 - [Music]
09:19 - boom it's just that easy you see that it
09:22 - worked again I hope you're starting to
09:23 - recognize you are a real game developer
09:26 - okay because I see you now guys before
09:29 - we wrap up here's a quick reminder be
09:31 - sure to add a checkpoint at the end of
09:33 - your level so the player has a place to
09:35 - respond this is going to be so necessary
09:37 - because we keep making our Obby harder
09:40 - and harder with each passing level
09:41 - alright Gamers you have learned so much
09:44 - in this video like you quite literally
09:47 - really understood the assignment okay
09:49 - before we talk about what's next I
09:52 - wanted to remind you that you can go
09:53 - back to levels one and two and change
09:55 - the scripts in our various parts and
09:57 - objects and continue to build out level
09:59 - three that way your game can be truly
10:02 - unique just like you
10:04 - [Music]
10:08 - um
10:23 - now that you've completed level three go
10:25 - to file save to Roblox this option will
10:28 - save the Obi in Roblox studio and on
10:30 - your online account
10:32 - please come back for video 5 where we
10:34 - will learn how to add power ups to our
10:37 - Avi we've been making our hobby harder
10:39 - and harder now let's see how we can give
10:41 - our game players some advantages bye for
10:44 - now and until next time game on family
10:47 - [Music]
10:54 - thank you
10:55 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hey hey gaming family I'm your host Cheyenne and I'm excited to welcome you back to video 4 of code along in this video we'll be learning how to add and edit scripts to objects which will allow us to customize actions and effects in our game we will also be building level 3 of our Obby the contaminated ocean so let's dive into Roblox well maybe not dive because you know get it dirty ocean water closed out of Roblox studio and need to find your hobby then go to file open from Roblox and choose your game in the previous videos we added objects from our Marketplace to our Avi each object was unique because of scripts written into the object allow the Creator to add custom actions and effects let's learn how to customize our objects through scripts first I will need to build out level

will open next to your base plate the new script will have a default code saying prints parentheses hello world parentheses oh well that's nice but I have to delete it sadly okay hi bye now let's rename our script to fade block because we want the block to fade in and out it's time to start writing our code inside the fade block script I want to create a variable in Roblox variables are names

its value in our case the script is located in the secret block 1 object doing this will allow us to select and edit the object and local means we want to use the variable only on this script now that we can edit the secret block one object let's add the action to make the block disappear I'll use a function which declares an action on the object this means it will give instructions on what action
