02:16 - to introduce you to the speakers as I
02:19 - said I'm Samantha but we have Joanne
02:21 - Hill
02:23 - Leah Castleberry and Dr Patrice Johnson
02:26 - here
02:28 - so let's get started so let's talk about
02:31 - the journey and the vision
02:33 - so this conversation is grounded in our
02:36 - visual visual our vision of radical
02:39 - change in Tech
02:40 - so we're going to start with giving you
02:42 - the opportunity to learn about our panel
02:46 - so to the panel tell us about your
02:48 - journey why Tech what made you choose
02:51 - the roles that you got into
02:53 - and what was the what was guiding you in
02:56 - your journey to Tech and through Tech
03:05 - I guess I'm gonna go first yes thank you
03:10 - I I will break the ice Samantha
03:13 - um so I am Dr Patrice and I work with
03:16 - the amazing wonderful organization that
03:20 - is hosting this Summit black girls code
03:22 - I serve as the chief programs officer
03:25 - for black girls code and this is my
03:28 - first role squarely in the tech industry
03:32 - and the only reason why I chose to come
03:36 - to black girls code was because it is
03:39 - not like any other Tech organization
03:42 - it's sole purpose is not just a center
03:45 - black girls in their genius but it is an
03:48 - organization that seeks to disrupt
03:50 - so I was not necessarily interested in
03:53 - Tech before BGC what piqued my interest
03:56 - was that Tech was just one of the tools
04:01 - used to talk about disruptive
04:04 - Innovations utilizing Tech and looking
04:08 - at centering social inequity and
04:11 - considering what it looks like to
04:13 - liberate black girls and what that looks
04:16 - like to liberate everybody
04:18 - so that is one of the reasons why
04:21 - um I took this path
04:23 - um even the name or name black girl's
04:26 - code is disruptive
04:29 - it's disruptive
04:31 - um if you look at our founding and our
04:33 - history we were challenged on that name
04:36 - why are black girls cold right there's
04:39 - something different to say I'm gonna
04:41 - Center black girls
04:42 - in what other space do we
04:45 - unapologetically since are black girls
04:48 - and so Tech was just the icing on the
04:51 - cake for me but understanding that
04:54 - technology as an industry has always
04:56 - been here we're going back to the way we
04:59 - got our electricity right like these
05:03 - these inventions and how we plug up our
05:06 - phones and how we you know Iron our
05:08 - clothes and the way that you get stop
05:10 - lights all of that is technology but in
05:13 - this day and age I think technology
05:17 - um is Shifting us in a way that we can
05:19 - use it as a tool to change the way race
05:24 - and gender in class are experienced in
05:26 - our country so I think that that's to
05:29 - answer your questions Samantha to be the
05:31 - brave first person to go because now I'm
05:33 - going to tease Leah and Joanne
05:36 - um that is why uh I've chosen this work
05:43 - that is wonderful
05:46 - it's wonderful let's keep the
05:48 - conversation
05:48 - oh okay go sorry Joanne
05:52 - um hi everyone I'm so happy to be here
05:54 - thank you Samantha for this great
05:56 - introduction and thank you to the black
05:58 - girls co-organization for having us for
06:00 - the alumni Summit
06:02 - um so much of my career up to this point
06:04 - has been at the intersection of business
06:06 - technology and policy so I studied
06:10 - um international business at Howard
06:12 - University for undergrad and uh I'm very
06:15 - much and have always been very
06:17 - passionate about history culture and
06:19 - people and so as I approached my journey
06:24 - in studying business I didn't
06:26 - necessarily want to just go the
06:28 - corporate route but wanted to do
06:29 - something that had more meaning and
06:31 - impact in my day-to-day work
06:33 - um so I did different opportunities
06:35 - Fellowship programs internship programs
06:37 - that allow me to explore those other
06:39 - areas like the ppia public policy and
06:43 - international Affairs fellowship at
06:45 - Carnegie Mellon University which was my
06:48 - first introduction to Tech policy and
06:50 - turned at the state department but
06:53 - ultimately I ended up going the
06:55 - corporate route and I started my career
06:57 - as a business consultant at IBM Global
07:00 - business services and at that time they
07:03 - were really building out the Watson
07:05 - division the Artificial Intelligence
07:07 - Division as a solution for IBM's other
07:10 - corporate clients and I joined that team
07:13 - and I began studying I was immediately
07:15 - so intrigued by Watson and by Ai and the
07:19 - potential that it had but because of the
07:21 - lens that I see through the world as a
07:24 - black woman in my my lived experience I
07:26 - had a lot of questions about what we
07:28 - were doing to make sure that we were
07:31 - centering different types of
07:34 - lived experiences different cultures my
07:37 - International my international business
07:39 - background tapped in there and I started
07:41 - asking those questions and I decided to
07:44 - go back to school I went to grad school
07:46 - at the University of Chicago Harris
07:47 - School of Public Policy because I
07:49 - thought public policy might be a way
07:52 - that we can address some of these
07:53 - questions so a lot of what I did there
07:56 - centered on public policy and the
07:58 - question of how in a radical way in a
08:02 - disruptive way how can we think about
08:05 - Innovative Technologies and an
08:07 - opportunity to dismantle as opposed to
08:10 - perpetuate systematic oppression so how
08:13 - can we think about not just making
08:16 - things Equitable but tearing down
08:18 - historical barriers that have existed
08:21 - for different people
08:22 - currently I am back in the back in the
08:25 - private sector and really thinking about
08:28 - products so how do we really Center
08:31 - those experiences in the ways that
08:33 - different people from different
08:35 - communities different experiences engage
08:38 - with both hardware and software products
08:44 - that is wonderful wonderful all right
08:48 - and so as Patrice said she kicked it off
08:50 - so I'm ending it'll get the introduction
08:53 - but that is so appropriate because uh
08:56 - she mentioned definitely dived into
08:58 - Innovation and I work for IBM we're one
09:01 - of the most Innovative
09:03 - companies and Leah I did not realize you
09:06 - know also so this is this is really
09:08 - great I actually attended an HBCU I got
09:12 - my computer science degree from
09:14 - Mississippi Valley State University so
09:16 - my journey actually started I'd say
09:18 - pretty much College I actually my first
09:21 - semester I I chose accounting as my
09:24 - major but then with then after the first
09:26 - semester I switched to computer science
09:28 - so my journey has been long as in Tech I
09:31 - pretty much started with computer
09:33 - science and then I interned with IBM uh
09:36 - the summer before I graduated and I've
09:38 - been with IBM so I'm still with IBM and
09:42 - I know but with that I've been in so
09:46 - many different roles because it has
09:48 - afforded me the opportunity too I worked
09:51 - in Global Services which is Consulting
09:53 - now I started in Hardware in uh in
09:57 - Upstate New York so that's that was that
09:59 - that uh you know my initial introduction
10:01 - as a programmer and then a few years
10:04 - into that I wanted to also just maybe
10:08 - get a little bit closer to the customers
10:11 - just to see how the technology was
10:13 - working so I started or was able to do a
10:16 - shadow somewhat of a systems engineer at
10:19 - the time and that was a way of me being
10:22 - able to continue my technology uh you
10:26 - know uh expertise and experience along
10:29 - with working with clients and becoming
10:31 - client-facing and so I've been in I've
10:34 - been project management product
10:36 - management technology manager just uh
10:38 - ran the gamut IBM also has supported me
10:41 - I eventually also got my Master's in
10:45 - software engineering and uh in my master
10:48 - certificate in project management so I
10:50 - continue to learn and that's one thing
10:52 - that I would love the um you know the
10:55 - black girls alumni to understand
10:56 - constant learning when we talk about
10:58 - Innovation you have to keep learning and
11:01 - seeing what's happening you know uh in
11:04 - the world and just just to finish up as
11:07 - far as where I'm working now it's a
11:09 - really cool initiative is within IBM
11:12 - called call for code and that is a way
11:15 - of I work with uh clients and then there
11:19 - are students involved where we invite
11:21 - developers and problem solvers at a
11:24 - global scale to work on Solutions
11:26 - somewhat in a hackathon fashion a
11:29 - competition but working on real world
11:31 - problems working on solutions to real
11:34 - world problems because we don't want to
11:35 - just identify problems we want to work
11:37 - on solutions to problems so uh so very
11:39 - glad to be here uh not I can't speak for
11:43 - IBM but uh very very much uh you know
11:45 - big big proponent and it there are a lot
11:48 - of opportunities and we have a lot of
11:49 - Technology AI as Leah mentioned so yes a
11:53 - lot of a lot of technology in order to
11:56 - uh to disrupt thank you
12:00 - Samantha just a shout out to IBM IBM's
12:04 - team is with our team in South Africa as
12:06 - we speak uh bringing back our South
12:09 - Africa chapter so we I appreciate IBM as
12:12 - well yes so we're here in the U.S doing
12:16 - this but we got a team in South Africa
12:18 - teaching about 55 girls in Johannesburg
12:21 - right now with IBM so we appreciate you
12:23 - yes yeah Yolanda raver and who's really
12:27 - really uh pulling that together so thank
12:30 - you
12:31 - I I saw the photos on social this
12:33 - morning they were beautiful I'm so
12:35 - excited for those students and their
12:37 - experience
12:38 - on to the next question thank you so
12:40 - much for telling us about yourselves and
12:42 - connecting these dots uh but we want to
12:45 - talk about the tech ecosystem as an
12:47 - interconnected and independent pipeline
12:49 - of entities such as K-12 education
12:52 - post-secondary Tech Pathways the
12:55 - workforce and Entrepreneurship forward
12:57 - slash Venture Capital within your field
12:59 - in the tech ecosystem what does an
13:02 - inclusive and Equitable future look like
13:04 - to you what steps are you taking in your
13:08 - role career to build towards this vision
13:10 - and I want to start with Leah
13:13 - sure I'm happy to kick it off
13:15 - um
13:16 - what does an inclusive and Equitable
13:18 - Tech future look like for me
13:19 - um
13:21 - I think we are and people that I work
13:24 - with
13:25 - um are really working towards how do we
13:29 - mitigate proactively as opposed to
13:32 - reactively when it comes to building the
13:35 - technological future
13:38 - um in an inclusive way so how do we make
13:42 - sure that on the front end and as I'm
13:44 - sure many folks in this room know it is
13:47 - so much easier to build something
13:50 - proactively and address it as opposed to
13:52 - going back and fixing something
13:54 - particularly in the product space
13:56 - retroactively once it's already been
13:59 - done we know that you know Hardware
14:00 - product roadmaps for example can be five
14:04 - years six years or longer you know
14:07 - software is a little bit easier but when
14:10 - it when it comes to trying to address
14:14 - um ensuring that everyone has an
14:17 - inclusive experience we have to make
14:20 - sure we're asking the right questions
14:22 - and taking the extra time that it takes
14:24 - to address uh those those things in mind
14:28 - so how how are we thinking about all of
14:30 - the possible users who will come in
14:32 - contact with this product right how do
14:34 - how do people who are differently abled
14:37 - engage with products how do people with
14:40 - big hair wear VR glasses right how do we
14:44 - think about these things to make sure
14:46 - that everyone is having an inclusive and
14:48 - Equitable experience we know that also
14:50 - in the regulatory space we do anticipate
14:52 - that there will be some government
14:54 - regulation that will require big Tech to
14:58 - address these things but we know that
14:59 - that may be some time off and we can't
15:01 - wait we can't wait to start thinking
15:03 - about these things that has to be done
15:05 - now it's not an option so for me
15:08 - um
15:09 - thinking about how we build an inclusive
15:12 - text future and what that looks like
15:14 - we're addressing these things and
15:16 - thinking about and and doing our due
15:18 - diligence to address issues on the front
15:21 - end before they actually arise
15:25 - yes yes thank you let's move on to Dr
15:29 - Patrice
15:31 - I'm just soaking it all and I'm learning
15:33 - from Leah and Joanne on this call this
15:35 - is good I would I gotta concur with what
15:38 - Leah is saying and for me and I think
15:40 - for an organization like BGC it's it's
15:44 - building the space and the opportunity
15:47 - for those who have been historically
15:49 - distant disadvantaged or
15:52 - disenfranchised the space to build and
15:54 - to innovate because the way you think
15:57 - about the big hair or braids or the way
16:00 - you think about the lighting on our
16:02 - darker skin tones you have to have a
16:05 - person of color in the room and are we
16:08 - giving those are we giving people that
16:11 - look like a space to innovate and to
16:14 - create and so I think we have been
16:16 - ostracized from a lot of different
16:18 - Industries and I think we're in this
16:21 - intersection where technology really
16:23 - needs to consider how they support and
16:26 - invite black folks in right
16:29 - um so we think about
16:31 - we are the answer to our to our issues
16:34 - right like you think about the gentleman
16:36 - who created the cop stop app right so we
16:39 - know that technology can be a solution
16:41 - for social issues but the only way we do
16:44 - that is if we allow us to be the folks
16:46 - that are doing that and I think not only
16:49 - do we need to be supported with
16:50 - mentorship but we got to start give us
16:53 - the money can I just let out say I want
16:55 - all the money and shout out to the CEO
16:58 - Sophia because I always say to her just
17:00 - give me the money right I'm always
17:01 - asking for the money and I think it is
17:03 - true for uh black creators and black
17:06 - Founders and black folks who are being
17:08 - Innovative and creating apps and
17:10 - um experiencing technology in new ways
17:13 - they need the money and the resources to
17:15 - build we need the same resources good
17:18 - brother Mark Zuckerberg had I want the
17:20 - same resource okay
17:22 - um so I think that is how we become more
17:25 - inclusive we need the space to create
17:27 - and we need the money and the resources
17:30 - to create
17:34 - yes yes
17:37 - um last but not least let's move on keep
17:40 - the conversation going let's add some
17:42 - some more volume Joanne okay yeah and
17:45 - and pretty much uh Leah and Patrice had
17:47 - you know said it and described it the
17:49 - only additional thing that I can add is
17:52 - uh volunteerism and Patrice mentioned
17:54 - mentorship of course so and that is a
17:57 - big thing that I truly believe in and
18:00 - and I do and in order you for various
18:03 - organizations you have to be in the room
18:05 - you know as as Patrice mentioned that's
18:08 - got that's very key so we've got to be
18:10 - there
18:11 - um and I know it can be hard sometimes
18:13 - you know if you're the only one in the
18:15 - room but you you have to you have to
18:17 - continue
18:18 - um you know being a part of the back to
18:20 - my what I said earlier you got to be a
18:22 - part of the solution you know not just
18:25 - uh you know identifying problems so
18:27 - that's the only way is uh we just gotta
18:30 - make room find find the space find a
18:33 - chair you know some where in the room in
18:35 - whatever organization within your
18:37 - company wherever you can in order uh you
18:40 - know to to be included and to be insured
18:42 - to be sure that that we're all
18:44 - especially black women you know are are
18:47 - included
18:49 - can I make one addition before we move
18:51 - on to the next question
18:53 - of course thanks Samantha um so in terms
18:57 - of
18:57 - uh career opportunities and thinking
19:00 - about different ways to address this
19:02 - question so as you know Samantha teed up
19:04 - for this question in particular the the
19:07 - technological ecosystem is made up of
19:09 - many different components and so there
19:11 - are opportunities in all of those
19:13 - different areas whether it be the
19:15 - educational sector the non-profit sector
19:17 - the entrepreneurial sector so think
19:19 - about which from which angle you would
19:22 - like to contribute and then also think
19:25 - about
19:26 - um going into the policy space so in
19:29 - order to make sure we're equally
19:31 - dividing those resources and making
19:33 - giving access to resources like Dr
19:35 - Patrice mentioned we have to make sure
19:37 - that we have the right folks in those in
19:40 - those policy rooms and in the in on the
19:43 - hill and in different governmental
19:45 - spaces to be the voice and to Advocate
19:47 - to make sure that our communities are
19:50 - represented and we're making sure that
19:52 - there's Equitable access for for example
19:54 - for computer science programs funding
19:57 - for computer science as programs in
19:58 - public school systems and historically
20:00 - marginalized communities access to
20:03 - different resources for entrepreneurs
20:06 - Etc
20:08 - yes yes so true let's keep the
20:11 - conversation going and let's talk about
20:12 - challenges and realities
20:15 - um let's delve into a little bit the
20:17 - current challenges and how we can
20:19 - disrupt these uh systems of Oppression
20:22 - so with this first question so the
20:24 - effects of tech Innovation are
20:27 - immeasurable it significantly impacts
20:30 - our democracy our economy our society
20:33 - yet not all communities are benefiting
20:36 - equally from this Innovation we recently
20:39 - saw during this pandemic which
20:42 - spotlighted the Stark economic health
20:44 - education inequities
20:46 - um you know virtual learning for
20:48 - instance we saw instances where some
20:50 - communities had to I don't know go to to
20:53 - local uh open areas just to find Wi-Fi
20:57 - just to be able to be a part of the the
21:00 - shift in learning we saw that a lot of
21:03 - infrastructures and cities didn't have
21:05 - anything available to make sure that all
21:08 - the students could equitably access
21:10 - anything the tech whether it's
21:12 - technology whether the hardware at home
21:14 - to the broader technology that they
21:16 - needed to connect with
21:18 - um what does it look like to innovate
21:21 - with accessibility and equity in mind
21:23 - what steps can we take to intentionally
21:26 - Center historically disadvantaged
21:27 - communities and we're going to start off
21:29 - with with Dr Patrice Johnson on that one
21:32 - so I love this question and I think it
21:35 - it what Leah has led us to in her last
21:38 - response definitely talks about it and I
21:40 - love that response Leah
21:43 - um I would say what gives me Paul's
21:47 - um is the infrastructure even if you
21:51 - look at the last week Jackson ain't got
21:54 - no water
21:55 - here in Detroit we had power outage for
21:58 - about four days so how can we say that
22:01 - we can equitably allow people to engage
22:05 - in technology when our infrastructure we
22:08 - are still like living in 1945
22:12 - in some of our community we I mean we
22:14 - talk about basic water right now we
22:16 - ain't even talking about we ain't even
22:18 - talking about Wi-Fi can I get good water
22:21 - can I get lights right
22:25 - um so so that's what right now kind of
22:27 - gives me pause to to think that our
22:30 - infrastructure primarily in urban
22:32 - communities
22:34 - has not been addressed so we're you're
22:37 - right and say the pandemic just exposed
22:41 - to the larger Community these
22:45 - um grave disadvantages right where kids
22:48 - who who are in urban cores don't have
22:51 - iPads and laptops like when you go to
22:55 - for example in Detroit is West
22:57 - Bloomfield they already have MacBooks at
22:59 - home in fact their parents had to buy
23:01 - the MacBook for them to start the class
23:03 - right that was post that was
23:05 - pre-pandemic so we are already Gravely
23:09 - behind right so I I think
23:13 - my vision or what I would love to see is
23:16 - can we start utilizing technology to
23:18 - give give me the basic things right now
23:20 - I don't think Jack I don't think folks
23:22 - in Jackson Mississippi really care about
23:25 - me giving them an iPad so that they can
23:27 - they can code or they can hack they need
23:30 - water
23:31 - and that's what just gives me great
23:33 - pause because it's not just Jack said it
23:35 - was Flint 10 years ago I mean so I don't
23:39 - know if I can adequately answer that
23:41 - question Samantha because I think the
23:44 - way I feel if I'm being authentic right
23:46 - now is I'm angry that my folks ain't got
23:49 - basic stuff
23:51 - so how can we innovate when the best
23:55 - creators don't even have water right now
24:00 - and and I you're gonna have to tag Lee
24:02 - and Joanne I can't even answer that
24:05 - yeah points were made yeah well I I can
24:10 - jump in with with something that we're
24:12 - doing at least with an IBL uh for two
24:14 - weeks but it's so interesting it's
24:16 - following you because um I'm from
24:18 - Mississippi my family is in Jackson so
24:20 - definitely you know they've been um
24:23 - impacted you know by the water situation
24:25 - just as you know across the others are
24:28 - are impacted as well but one thing and I
24:31 - think I mentioned earlier that I'm
24:32 - working on a team called call for code
24:34 - and so it definitely it takes it's not
24:38 - not IBM alone it's partnership with
24:41 - other you know other companies everybody
24:44 - needs to to
24:46 - um jump in and work on Solutions but
24:48 - with our call for code that is the
24:51 - overall idea it's open source working on
24:53 - some open source Solutions and that's
24:56 - pulling in like I said experience uh you
24:59 - know technologists uh designers people
25:02 - from Global all over the world to work
25:05 - on some of those Solutions and
25:07 - ironically for this year that the thief
25:10 - is sustainability so that really you
25:13 - know dives into the uh you know the the
25:16 - water you know issues the disparities
25:18 - education gaps um I would say back to to
25:23 - answer I think at the top of the
25:25 - question uh Leah had already covered it
25:27 - too I mean it's going to take
25:28 - legislative changes you know policy
25:31 - changes to really make a difference but
25:34 - I will say I mean the technology is
25:37 - there just the base technology I mean
25:39 - you got the software you got the
25:40 - hardware but it just takes uh a lot of
25:44 - us it's going to take everyone uh to
25:46 - really I think impact you know the the
25:49 - main issue I'm I'm with you I I get very
25:52 - angry as well because it's like yes
25:55 - we're doing things and you know others
25:58 - are doing things but the problem's still
26:00 - you know still remain and you can't you
26:02 - just can't affect it for everyone all at
26:05 - the same time it's moving you know too
26:07 - slowly for sure
26:09 - um but um you know together we can start
26:12 - making some impacts
26:15 - Leo that's great I totally agree
26:18 - um I
26:19 - I've also been thinking a lot about
26:22 - about Jackson and and what I can do to
26:25 - play my role to support the communities
26:27 - there
26:28 - um and it it really just gets to the
26:32 - Maslow's hierarchy of needs right so if
26:35 - you're very foundational needs as an
26:38 - individual
26:39 - are not being met as a community are not
26:42 - being met how can you get to that point
26:46 - of living in this ideal state where you
26:51 - can be your most creative your most
26:53 - Innovative if you don't have the basic
26:57 - necessities for life so that is
26:58 - something that we definitely need to
27:00 - think about but I will also say the
27:03 - other side of that is when things like
27:06 - this have happened
27:07 - people have come up with creative ideas
27:10 - of how do we filter the water to you
27:15 - know make it drinkable and different
27:16 - technologies that have come about as a
27:19 - as a result of kind of these
27:21 - um very
27:23 - uh impactful and devastating scenarios
27:27 - so
27:28 - um you know I think we all are thinking
27:30 - through kind of what we can do to
27:31 - support and and and thinking through
27:34 - what new Innovations might different
27:37 - scenarios Spark
27:39 - I I would add if that's okay Samantha I
27:43 - would add that
27:45 - one of the
27:46 - beautiful components of the work that
27:49 - we're doing is when you get uh for
27:53 - summer camp for example 50 girls in a
27:56 - room and they have that space again to
28:01 - create and we had a hackathon this year
28:03 - too uh it's a beautiful it's a beautiful
28:06 - experience it's the impact is it will
28:09 - floor you right because all of a sudden
28:12 - uh black girls are forming their own
28:15 - Community
28:16 - uh they're centering themselves around
28:18 - joy and they're creating these amazing
28:21 - apps that are that can solve real issues
28:24 - right so so I would say
28:27 - um although
28:29 - and I love your theoretical component
28:31 - Leah with Maslow's hierarchy of me but I
28:34 - think
28:35 - um although it does look dire there
28:38 - there are moments of Hope right that we
28:41 - can hold on to and for me I can reflect
28:43 - on those girls being at camp and the
28:46 - smiles on their faces and the way that
28:49 - they light up when they figured out how
28:50 - to do some stuff that I can't do
28:52 - um our education team will see they try
28:55 - to teach us how to code this art last
28:57 - week and I and my I had a stick figure
28:59 - right where our girls were creating
29:02 - these beautiful art images and so
29:05 - um there there is space for us to Hope
29:08 - right but I think we've got to put some
29:10 - pressure on the entire ecosystem from
29:13 - the legislators to these big companies
29:16 - to say we got to do some Grassroots
29:19 - basic stuff
29:23 - yeah so very true I think you've kind of
29:26 - answered this but we did have a question
29:28 - from the audience uh as someone who was
29:30 - breaking through barriers that's why it
29:33 - is so hard to get into the sector how
29:35 - does one find a breakthrough
29:41 - I think that this is going towards a
29:44 - breakthrough into career opportunities I
29:47 - believe that's what this is speaking
29:49 - towards I'll answer it from that lens
29:52 - um for me and it is not easy
29:56 - we know that things can often be more
29:58 - difficult for people who look like us
30:01 - even when we have the same credentials
30:05 - um
30:05 - my strategy I'll speak to my personal
30:07 - experience and my personal strategy my
30:10 - personal experience I've really honed in
30:15 - on something actually that Joanne
30:16 - mentioned earlier was being a constant
30:18 - learner how can I make sure that I am
30:22 - continuing to increase my heart skills
30:25 - my soft skills right so hard skills for
30:29 - this for this particular group would be
30:31 - things like making sure you're learning
30:34 - new coding languages if you can
30:36 - continuing to you know improve your
30:38 - skills those technical skills are so
30:41 - valuable in the industry maybe it's
30:45 - studying project management getting a
30:47 - project management certification
30:50 - um
30:51 - thinking and studying user-centered
30:53 - design user experiences design thinking
30:56 - those types of Prudential soft skills
30:58 - like public speaking
31:02 - um writing different things of
31:04 - relationship building
31:06 - um
31:07 - also networking and mentoring when we
31:10 - talked about mentoring earlier
31:12 - networking and building mutually
31:14 - beneficial relationships making sure
31:16 - that you're building relationships that
31:18 - aren't just meant to be transactional
31:20 - and seeking to get something out of it
31:22 - but also what can you give to the
31:24 - relationship how can it be something
31:27 - that's long term where you can support
31:29 - one another whether that's up here or
31:31 - maybe that's someone who is more
31:34 - experienced than you or has more
31:35 - knowledge so for me those have been ways
31:38 - that I have uh tried to continue to
31:43 - build on my resume but also open
31:46 - different doors to Opportunities and
31:48 - break down some of those barriers
31:54 - anyone would like to add
31:58 - well I think Leah has covered it but I
32:01 - mean Network attending events like this
32:04 - uh you know networking uh it's it's it's
32:07 - all about continuous learning you know
32:10 - as Leah um mentioned as well uh that's
32:13 - the way to if you're talking about
32:14 - breaking into different Industries or
32:17 - just breaking into anything Tech I will
32:19 - say I mean technology it runs the gamut
32:22 - so I mean whether it's in education uh
32:26 - you know it's in healthcare I mean
32:29 - government it's technology is everywhere
32:32 - so it's not really essentially breaking
32:35 - into technology but you do have to learn
32:37 - you know certain skills if it takes uh
32:40 - back to being you know data scientists
32:42 - you know python or R learning things
32:44 - like that
32:46 - um so that you just have to start you
32:47 - got Network you got to reach out uh use
32:50 - all the you know all the social media
32:52 - you know connections that that you can
32:54 - and just show up you know at events um
32:58 - and just ask for help and and you know
33:00 - it can happen
33:05 - thank you and also join those digital
33:08 - communities whether they're on Facebook
33:09 - or elsewhere
33:11 - um there are a lot of opportunities that
33:13 - are presented there are a lot of people
33:14 - that are willing to crowd uh Source
33:17 - resources answer your questions to
33:19 - support you in any way I know I've been
33:21 - an online uh communities like sister
33:24 - Circle black women in Tech where someone
33:26 - says I've just lost my job or I'm having
33:28 - this issue or I'm navigating this
33:30 - difficult conversation with my boss and
33:32 - folks are happily are willing to share
33:35 - their their expertise their experiences
33:38 - their connections so I think being in
33:40 - community can be a major way in which we
33:43 - break through these barriers let's keep
33:45 - it going
33:46 - um next question a reality of tech is
33:49 - that it can be used for good or bad
33:51 - we've seen Tech amplify social justice
33:53 - movements and help us utilize our
33:55 - Collective agency via social media we've
33:57 - also seen how racial and algorithmic
34:00 - biases in Tech can have negatively
34:02 - impacted specific communities via
34:04 - surveillance so surveillance or facial
34:06 - recognition software and even in in ways
34:09 - we're employed as we work toward
34:12 - Innovation how can future innovators
34:14 - intentionally keep the moral and ethical
34:16 - consequences of tech at the Forefront of
34:19 - their work whether it's government
34:20 - regulation or accountability policies
34:23 - let's start with you Joanne
34:27 - okay not to sound like a repeat record
34:29 - this is your broken record but I think
34:31 - Leah covered it you know already and
34:33 - we've talked about it it's essentially
34:35 - you you have to be in the room you need
34:39 - to be part of you know part of the
34:42 - solution uh put I would say one key
34:45 - thing is
34:47 - um taking the initiative to understand
34:51 - uh kind of see through the lens of those
34:54 - in disadvantaged areas or economically
34:57 - disadvantaged that that is going to be
34:59 - key in order to really make a difference
35:02 - and understand how to utilize the
35:05 - technology so technology can you know as
35:08 - as you say it can be it could be used
35:10 - for good for bad but it could be it's
35:12 - used for good mostly so but awareness is
35:16 - very key about like what is it really
35:19 - doing what what are the intended you
35:21 - know outcome and I know especially when
35:24 - you start talking about you know AI you
35:26 - know artificial intelligence I think
35:28 - that gets some people a real you know a
35:31 - little bit of free because it's like
35:33 - okay the you know robots are going to
35:35 - take over or whatever but you know
35:38 - behind those computers behind the robots
35:40 - they're humans so that's why it's very
35:44 - important that you have a diverse uh you
35:47 - know set of people in the room that's
35:49 - working on Solutions so if there's an
35:52 - opportunity for you to be a product
35:54 - manager you know that is very very key
35:57 - because you can really provide a lot of
36:00 - input in how that product is going to
36:03 - you know be developed and how it will
36:05 - eventually uh you know be deployed so so
36:08 - I would say that's key uh we do of
36:10 - course need more you know diverse uh
36:13 - people at the top because those are the
36:15 - ones that are making the decisions uh
36:17 - but so just continue back once again
36:19 - back to learning you know figuring out
36:22 - you know the various angles uh where you
36:24 - can can be in the room or you know at
36:26 - the table table even if you're not at
36:28 - the table you know once again just
36:30 - somewhere but making a contribution uh
36:33 - you know to the solution that I think
36:35 - that would that would be that's one of
36:36 - the key things
36:40 - that I think what what Joanne just said
36:43 - is so powerful because she gave us I
36:47 - will say this what we've seen with
36:49 - technology over the last 10 years
36:53 - um the ability to utilize social media
36:56 - as a form of activism right I believe I
36:59 - believe that
37:01 - a couple days after George Floyd was
37:03 - murdered it was like eight million
37:05 - tweets that use the hashtag black lives
37:08 - matter right so to be able to utilize
37:12 - social media in a way that can Galvanize
37:16 - folks and build a communication system
37:19 - across the globe right is immensely
37:24 - powerful I mean you think if they would
37:25 - have had that in in 68 right uh I think
37:29 - my My Hope has been how do you take that
37:32 - massive engagement and shift it from uh
37:37 - the social space to
37:39 - actual uh material change and I think
37:43 - what Joanne just said is exactly that I
37:46 - think she's saying for us to really
37:49 - utilize technology as a solution to some
37:53 - of the social experiences that we have
37:54 - how do we put our folks in a position
37:57 - like a product manager that could tell
38:00 - Apple don't you put out that phone and
38:03 - you know good and well the facial
38:04 - recognition is biased right
38:07 - it does not adequately see my skin tone
38:09 - and or
38:11 - um you have these new vehicles that are
38:14 - supposed to be self-driving and you
38:16 - hitting black folks right because you
38:18 - don't recognize us
38:20 - um and I'm smiling but it's also it's
38:21 - it's not it's you know
38:24 - um
38:24 - so I love the fact that connecting both
38:28 - what Leah and Joanna is saying they are
38:30 - really diving on to Solutions right
38:33 - which which I adore
38:35 - um so how do we move from that matter
38:38 - massive way we can benefit from
38:40 - technology in the social space and
38:42 - engaging socially to the material change
38:46 - the material change and using technology
38:49 - as a solution for an app like cop stop
38:53 - or you know identifying as Leah said
38:57 - proactively the ways Tech can
39:00 - potentially be biased but solving those
39:02 - problems by having the right people in
39:04 - the spaces to make those decisions
39:09 - I totally agree I was going to mention
39:13 - product management I'm so glad that both
39:16 - of you already brought it up
39:18 - um I think particularly in this room
39:21 - that is specially curated for black
39:23 - women and girls it's important that we
39:25 - think about these types of careers where
39:28 - yes we are underrepresented however we
39:32 - bring a unique lens and unique
39:35 - experience to these types of roles right
39:38 - for a product manager or a technical
39:41 - program manager for example so in these
39:43 - types of positions you have a
39:46 - significant level of influence over the
39:49 - entire product development process from
39:51 - start to finish right you have the skill
39:55 - set to be able to understand and speak
39:58 - the language of the engineers and the
40:01 - technical folks working on the product
40:03 - while also translating for the people in
40:07 - the business who are driving
40:09 - um towards the you know the the business
40:12 - goals right and and you're the person
40:15 - who bridges that Gap and makes sure that
40:18 - along the way the right questions are
40:20 - being asked you know you're considering
40:23 - for all of the different factors that
40:25 - need to come into account and as black
40:27 - women we have a unique land through
40:30 - which we look at the world right and so
40:33 - and and you know we have that in common
40:36 - but we also have unique experiences
40:38 - right so what are your unique
40:39 - experiences that allow you to think
40:42 - about
40:44 - um how different people might engage
40:46 - with a product and ensuring that you you
40:48 - can be a voice in the room that say we
40:51 - need to diversify the the the data set
40:54 - and make sure we're including more users
40:58 - who
40:59 - of of X background right and making sure
41:03 - that all of that is considered along the
41:05 - way so definitely do consider
41:08 - um careers and in either you know
41:10 - technical program management or product
41:13 - management because as having that black
41:15 - girls cold technical Foundation is a
41:18 - great differentiator
41:19 - um even if you don't desire to be an
41:21 - engineer there are other opportunities
41:23 - and and
41:25 - um career paths that will allow you to
41:27 - still utilize that skill set and and uh
41:30 - you know kind of different differentiate
41:32 - you
41:33 - um amongst the the applicant pool for
41:35 - such roles
41:39 - yes yes
41:41 - um also if if anyone's interested in
41:43 - kind of learning more about this topic
41:44 - I'm in the middle of reading uh race
41:47 - after technology by ruha Benjamin um
41:49 - where they discussed abolitionist tools
41:52 - for the new gym code
41:54 - um and it goes into historical context
41:56 - current realities and future outlook
41:58 - um there's a lot of really good
42:00 - information in there that we can kind of
42:02 - equip ourselves to come to these tables
42:04 - and talk about these things
42:06 - utilizing broader data research and and
42:10 - just knowing the language to use as we
42:12 - discuss these things because these are
42:14 - age-old issues
42:16 - um that are now connected to
42:18 - far-reaching Technologies so there's
42:21 - there's a lot of work to be done and I
42:22 - think all of us equipping ourselves
42:23 - being aware and not being afraid to
42:25 - adjust these Topics in any place in
42:28 - which we hold any amount of power or
42:30 - influence is important uh in the name of
42:32 - the book again because someone just
42:33 - asked is race after technology by ruha
42:38 - ruha treatment
42:40 - all right so let's keep the conversation
42:43 - moving let's talk about the progress and
42:46 - call to action
42:48 - circling back on your journey how have
42:50 - you seen progress in your sector
42:53 - what legacies Will Young innovators be
42:56 - building on
42:59 - and let's start with Leo
43:03 - sure
43:05 - um I think when I think about the Legacy
43:09 - um we've already touched on the fact
43:10 - that none of this is new our ancestors
43:14 - were extremely Innovative and creative
43:17 - people and we are products of their
43:20 - genius and
43:22 - keeping that in mind is one of the
43:25 - things that keeps me going
43:27 - um
43:28 - there's a a concept African concept of
43:32 - Sankofa you know understanding the past
43:35 - so that you can best forward and and
43:37 - drive towards the future
43:41 - um knowing our history and the shoulders
43:44 - upon which we stand uh is really
43:47 - important and also it keeps it keeps me
43:50 - going because
43:52 - this work is hard right if you choose to
43:57 - actually take a stand and be a person
43:59 - who wants to speak up and be that Agent
44:02 - of Change it can be challenging so along
44:06 - the way it's really important that we
44:11 - take care of ourselves right make sure
44:14 - that we're pouring into ourselves
44:16 - and that if we're not you know
44:19 - prioritizing our our Wellness physically
44:22 - mentally emotionally spiritually we
44:25 - can't do this work and so
44:28 - I really try to hone in on that
44:32 - um folks like Dr Benjamin who Samantha
44:35 - mentioned
44:37 - um there are just so many folks who are
44:40 - continuing to drive this work forward
44:42 - continue to study and read those books
44:46 - and think about
44:49 - um Dr Charlton McGowan has a book who
44:52 - talks about the black history and
44:55 - Technology you have to forgive me
44:57 - because I don't remember the name of the
44:59 - book but if you look up Dr Charles
45:01 - Charlton mcgillin it will come up
45:05 - um but just keep that in mind and that
45:09 - and that's something that keeps me
45:10 - grounded and keeps me going along this
45:12 - journey so that Legacy is very much
45:14 - important
45:18 - I think uh for me looking at the
45:21 - progress in the sector and what legacies
45:23 - we think young people will build on I go
45:26 - back to my experience with the girls
45:28 - over this summer we had
45:30 - technically six summer camps that uh I
45:34 - jokingly tell the team we were in it we
45:36 - don't know what happened with the rest
45:38 - of the world for those five camps five
45:40 - six camps but I will tell you
45:43 - um uh even though we might have been
45:45 - physically tired we were emotionally
45:49 - full because we we could see firsthand
45:53 - after not having in-person camps for two
45:56 - years or so because of covet you can see
46:00 - the way when a young lady gets it right
46:04 - when she's figured it out when she is
46:06 - able to
46:08 - um create something uh I mean we had
46:11 - girls at the Atlanta Camp during lunch
46:14 - time doing races with each other so I
46:16 - would say when we talk about
46:18 - their ability to innovate and the Legacy
46:22 - the legacy is
46:24 - um really about whole person development
46:26 - it is not only about the technology it
46:30 - is also about experiencing Joy it is
46:34 - about their leadership Journey right it
46:37 - is about community and then lastly as we
46:41 - like to say is also about economic
46:43 - Mobility right and and changing our
46:47 - material reality so for me that's what I
46:52 - see as the legacy of us continuing to
46:55 - encourage the girls that are on this
46:57 - call watching this session the uh you
47:01 - know five thousand ten thousand girls
47:03 - that will reach in a year
47:05 - those girls being able to form Community
47:07 - where they feel safe to create to
47:11 - experience their joy and and to to have
47:15 - the life that they want to live
47:23 - and and I'll just finish up uh Leah and
47:26 - Patrice you know have pretty much
47:27 - covered it as well
47:30 - um once again you know continuous
47:32 - learning I I would say the um the Advent
47:35 - of of there are so many ways of getting
47:39 - um getting upskilled getting educated
47:42 - you know getting a certifications
47:44 - getting badges just learning there's you
47:46 - know I don't want to advertise for
47:48 - different companies but you know like
47:50 - Coursera courses seeing a lot of
47:51 - pre-courses just a lot of online courses
47:54 - IBM by the way actually has a lot has a
47:57 - platform as well where continuous
48:00 - learning so definitely take advantage of
48:03 - all of those you know opportunities I
48:05 - think that is something that has
48:07 - progressed you know especially during my
48:09 - career I mean just so easy to to learn I
48:13 - mean we have a lot of internal learning
48:14 - but you know there are there are
48:16 - multiple uh external uh vehicles to
48:19 - learn from so I would say just incur
48:22 - urge just to continue uh continuous
48:25 - learning because that is going to to be
48:28 - key uh to the Future for the future
48:31 - innovators
48:32 - um the other thing is
48:34 - um wherever you are if there I mean if
48:36 - you are working or you know when you do
48:38 - start working uh there are various
48:40 - groups I think Leah touched on some
48:42 - there are different groups within
48:43 - companies you know the Affinity groups
48:45 - or the uh business resource groups uh
48:48 - that is very very key uh that wasn't
48:51 - available many many years ago so utilize
48:54 - those um you know vehicles uh you know
48:57 - to continue to innovate and learn as
48:59 - well I think that's that's the only
49:01 - additional uh thing I can can say
49:05 - I'll just add one last thing in terms of
49:08 - progress I do think that we have made
49:10 - tremendous progress even this is a very
49:13 - nascent space still when you think about
49:15 - inclusive technology or Equitable
49:17 - technology and conversations and
49:19 - resources around this
49:21 - um and so I think that there is
49:24 - tremendous opportunity to continue
49:26 - building and only amplify uh the work
49:29 - that has already been done so if I do
49:31 - want I did want to just circle back and
49:33 - acknowledge that I do think that
49:36 - um particularly in the last Maybe
49:40 - five or ten years there's been a lot of
49:43 - evolution growth and progress
49:45 - um and you know as Joanne mentioned that
49:48 - continuous learning allows you to kind
49:50 - of stay abreast and on the front curve
49:52 - of this ever evolving uh still growing
49:56 - and nascent uh space that we're in
49:59 - yeah I would agree with that yeah
50:01 - because technology as they say you know
50:03 - it doesn't stand still you know so it's
50:06 - continuing continuing to evolve
50:10 - yes I'd have to agree I would think what
50:13 - what's so beautiful is when you see just
50:17 - folks finding each other because they've
50:19 - been able to use different technology
50:20 - different platforms social media to find
50:23 - corners of the internet with people that
50:26 - they can relate to on multiple levels
50:28 - and start building together so in the
50:31 - way that
50:32 - um these inequalities the systemic
50:34 - issues exist you see so many individuals
50:38 - or even smaller Collective groups having
50:41 - even greater impact for their
50:42 - communities because they can leverage
50:44 - these Technologies they can leverage
50:45 - these tools they can self-educate they
50:48 - can mobilize they can immediately
50:50 - respond they can get to the heart of
50:53 - these issues and have the conversation
50:55 - you don't need to feel alone you don't
50:57 - need to wonder if you're the only one
50:58 - thinking or wanting or creating you can
51:01 - find someone to create with across the
51:03 - street or across the world and as many
51:07 - issues as there are in this world
51:09 - there's individual Minds with a
51:12 - willingness to try to tackle them and no
51:14 - matter how niched or or how broad that
51:17 - is so like as we talk about progress and
51:19 - call to action a big part of what we're
51:22 - seeing now and what we saw during the
51:23 - pandemic and we when we saw we've seen
51:26 - in recent social justice movements as
51:28 - people being able to self-identify uh
51:31 - mobilize and do the work wherever they
51:34 - are and that makes it more inclusive
51:36 - that makes it
51:38 - um uh more fast acting and that is
51:42 - something that I think will continue to
51:43 - be a powerful tool for further
51:45 - Generations even as you get into the
51:46 - metaverse even even as you think about
51:49 - how you're going to operationalize
51:51 - Future technology so get taking your
51:54 - seat at whatever table you can create
51:56 - not necessarily always having to
51:59 - um try to fight for a seat at someone
52:00 - else's table so so let's keep the
52:02 - conversation going what opportunities
52:04 - roles exist that uh to affect change in
52:08 - the tech space What should Young
52:10 - stemmists be doing now to build their
52:13 - way towards these impactful roles and
52:15 - what resources have been helpful in your
52:16 - journey
52:19 - yeah I'll jump in um I think we've
52:21 - touched touched a lot of different
52:24 - um areas of opportunity in the space
52:27 - whether that be in the private sector
52:30 - um in product technical program
52:31 - management project management
52:35 - um a user user experience design
52:38 - um engineering there there are so many
52:41 - um ways to address it in the private
52:43 - sector in the public sector there are
52:45 - opportunities at all level of government
52:47 - whether that and I know I mentioned the
52:49 - hill earlier but I will be remiss not to
52:51 - mention the importance of state and
52:52 - local government as well in ensuring
52:55 - access and advocacy
52:57 - um and access to resources for
52:59 - marginalized communities
53:02 - um there the the opportunities are are
53:04 - endless so it's really a matter of
53:07 - carving out the space and and figuring
53:09 - out what area you want to tackle and and
53:11 - also recognizing that you can change so
53:14 - I have done so many different things
53:17 - over the course of my relatively short
53:19 - career already because I've been trying
53:21 - to figure out and act that question of
53:23 - which way is the best path to address
53:25 - these very critical questions is it
53:27 - through the government is it through uh
53:29 - policy in the nonprofit sector is it
53:31 - actually being at the at the table or
53:33 - trying to pull up my own chair at the
53:35 - table in the private sector and in big
53:37 - Tech
53:38 - um so you know think about what what you
53:40 - might want to uh do and that uh breadth
53:45 - of experience also is very much a
53:48 - selling point when you come into any of
53:49 - those spaces being able to say well I've
53:51 - thought about it from this angle and I
53:53 - have experience that I can bring to the
53:55 - table from each of those different areas
53:57 - that's really important and that
53:58 - continuous Learning Journey definitely
54:00 - helps along the way with that
54:03 - yeah and and that very well said Leah
54:06 - and and I'll just add because I know we
54:07 - talked about you know product management
54:08 - project but any of those areas you know
54:11 - should be a focused data analyst just
54:13 - wherever you feel comfortable
54:14 - comfortable
54:16 - um and then from an industry uh as Leah
54:19 - I mean with the even though I've been
54:20 - with IBM but within there I've had uh
54:24 - opportunity to be exposed to various
54:25 - Industries within IBM so you know
54:28 - government Healthcare one of my
54:30 - favorites and you know Healthcare there
54:33 - are so many changes are so there are
54:35 - plenty of opportunity for some
54:37 - Innovation there uh with regard to
54:39 - health care just as with others but
54:41 - government insurance uh banking I mean
54:44 - there are the lots of of Industries in
54:47 - which you can apply you know those
54:49 - skills so I would say definitely just
54:52 - you know pick up the the key skills I
54:54 - mean uh Leah had started off earlier
54:56 - saying you know so you got the hard
54:58 - skills but you know the soft skills talk
55:00 - with get get an opportunity or learn to
55:03 - to work with with clients and partners
55:06 - and you know just it even within your
55:08 - community as I mentioned very big on
55:10 - volunteering so that is a way to get
55:13 - involved with your schools I mean that
55:15 - definitely they would really love you to
55:17 - go in and just talk you can learn a lot
55:19 - from the kids and from the teachers find
55:22 - out what they need help with as well so
55:25 - just just pick up the hard skills and
55:27 - you know definitely focus on the the
55:29 - soft skills and and you'll you'll be
55:31 - fine
55:33 - and I I would say to wrap it up
55:38 - um
55:39 - BGC alumni our alumni uh you got a
55:43 - portal
55:44 - that we have launched that will have
55:46 - tons of resources for you to dive into
55:50 - you have a team dedicated to servicing
55:54 - you and helping you identify uh any of
55:57 - the tools that you might need and so I
56:00 - would just say
56:02 - a action item for you is to stay
56:06 - connected to BGC as a community that
56:08 - wants you to do well and wants you to
56:10 - reach your full potential that is the
56:13 - action item that I think stimulus should
56:15 - pursue to allow us to continue to engage

56:20 - the next level that's what we're here

bottom left corner so let us know if you have any issues uh for the best viewing experience we suggest using Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge as your browser and now it's my pleasure to introduce you to the speakers as I said I'm Samantha but we have Joanne Hill Leah Castleberry and Dr Patrice Johnson here so let's get started so let's talk about the journey and the vision so this conversation is grounded in our visual visual our vision of radical change in Tech so we're going to start with giving you the opportunity to learn about our panel so to the panel tell us about your journey why Tech what made you choose the roles that you got into and what was the what was guiding you in your journey to Tech and through Tech I guess I'm gonna go first yes thank you I I will break the ice Samantha um so I am Dr Patrice and I work with the amazing wonderful organization that is hosting this Summit black girls code I serve as the chief programs officer for black girls code and this is my first role squarely in the tech industry and the only reason why I chose to come to black girls code was because it is not like any other Tech organization it's sole purpose is not just a center black girls in their genius but it is an organization that seeks to disrupt so I was not necessarily interested in Tech before BGC what piqued my interest was that Tech was just one of the tools used to talk about disruptive Innovations utilizing Tech and looking at centering social inequity and considering what it looks like to liberate black girls and what that looks like to liberate everybody so that is one of the reasons why um I took this path um even the name or name black girl's code is disruptive it's disruptive um if you look at our founding and our history we were challenged on that name why are black girls cold right there's something different to say I'm gonna Center black girls in what other space do we unapologetically since are black girls and so Tech was just the icing on the cake for me but understanding that technology as an industry has always been here we're going back to the way we got our electricity right like these these inventions and how we plug up our phones and how we you know Iron our clothes and the way that you get stop lights all of that is technology but in this day and age I think technology um is Shifting us in a way that we can use it as a tool to change the way race and gender in class are experienced in our country so I think that that's to answer your questions Samantha to be the brave first person to go because now I'm going to tease Leah and Joanne um that is why uh I've chosen this work that is wonderful it's wonderful let's keep the conversation oh okay go sorry Joanne um hi everyone I'm so happy to be here thank you Samantha for this great introduction and thank you to the black girls coorganization for having us for the alumni Summit um so much of my career up to this point has been at the intersection of business technology and policy so I studied um international business at Howard University for undergrad and uh I'm very much and have always been very passionate about history culture and people and so as I approached my journey in studying business I didn't necessarily want to just go the corporate route but wanted to do something that had more meaning and impact in my daytoday work um so I did different opportunities Fellowship programs internship programs that allow me to explore those other areas like the ppia public policy and international Affairs fellowship at Carnegie Mellon University which was my first introduction to Tech policy and turned at the state department but ultimately I ended up going the corporate route and I started my career as a business consultant at IBM Global business services and at that time they were really building out the Watson division the Artificial Intelligence Division as a solution for IBM's other corporate clients and I joined that team and I began studying I was immediately so intrigued by Watson and by Ai and the potential that it had but because of the lens that I see through the world as a black woman in my my lived experience I had a lot of questions about what we were doing to make sure that we were centering different types of lived experiences different cultures my International my international business background tapped in there and I started asking those questions and I decided to go back to school I went to grad school at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy because I thought public policy might be a way that we can address some of these questions so a lot of what I did there centered on public policy and the question of how in a radical way in a disruptive way how can we think about Innovative Technologies and an opportunity to dismantle as opposed to perpetuate systematic oppression so how can we think about not just making things Equitable but tearing down historical barriers that have existed for different people currently I am back in the back in the private sector and really thinking about products so how do we really Center those experiences in the ways that different people from different communities different experiences engage with both hardware and software products that is wonderful wonderful all right and so as Patrice said she kicked it off so I'm ending it'll get the introduction but that is so appropriate because uh she mentioned definitely dived into Innovation and I work for IBM we're one of the most Innovative companies and Leah I did not realize you know also so this is this is really great I actually attended an HBCU I got my computer science degree from Mississippi Valley State University so my journey actually started I'd say pretty much College I actually my first semester I I chose accounting as my major but then with then after the first semester I switched to computer science so my journey has been long as in Tech I pretty much started with computer science and then I interned with IBM uh the summer before I graduated and I've been with IBM so I'm still with IBM and I know but with that I've been in so many different roles because it has afforded me the opportunity too I worked in Global Services which is Consulting now I started in Hardware in uh in Upstate New York so that's that was that that uh you know my initial introduction as a programmer and then a few years into that I wanted to also just maybe get a little bit closer to the customers just to see how the technology was working so I started or was able to do a shadow somewhat of a systems engineer at the time and that was a way of me being able to continue my technology uh you know uh expertise and experience along with working with clients and becoming clientfacing and so I've been in I've been project management product management technology manager just uh ran the gamut IBM also has supported me I eventually also got my Master's in software engineering and uh in my master certificate in project management so I continue to learn and that's one thing that I would love the um you know the black girls alumni to understand constant learning when we talk about Innovation you have to keep learning and seeing what's happening you know uh in the world and just just to finish up as far as where I'm working now it's a really cool initiative is within IBM called call for code and that is a way of I work with uh clients and then there are students involved where we invite developers and problem solvers at a global scale to work on Solutions somewhat in a hackathon fashion a competition but working on real world problems working on solutions to real world problems because we don't want to just identify problems we want to work on solutions to problems so uh so very glad to be here uh not I can't speak for IBM but uh very very much uh you know big big proponent and it there are a lot of opportunities and we have a lot of Technology AI as Leah mentioned so yes a lot of a lot of technology in order to uh to disrupt thank you Samantha just a shout out to IBM IBM's team is with our team in South Africa as we speak uh bringing back our South Africa chapter so we I appreciate IBM as well yes so we're here in the U.S doing this but we got a team in South Africa teaching about 55 girls in Johannesburg right now with IBM so we appreciate you yes yeah Yolanda raver and who's really really uh pulling that together so thank you I I saw the photos on social this morning they were beautiful I'm so excited for those students and their experience on to the next question thank you so much for telling us about yourselves and connecting these dots uh but we want to talk about the tech ecosystem as an interconnected and independent pipeline of entities such as K12 education postsecondary Tech Pathways the workforce and Entrepreneurship forward slash Venture Capital within your field in the tech ecosystem what does an inclusive and Equitable future look like to you what steps are you taking in your role career to build towards this vision and I want to start with Leah sure I'm happy to kick it off um what does an inclusive and Equitable Tech future look like for me um I think we are and people that I work with um are really working towards how do we mitigate proactively as opposed to reactively when it comes to building the technological future um in an inclusive way so how do we make sure that on the front end and as I'm sure many folks in this room know it is so much easier to build something proactively and address it as opposed to going back and fixing something particularly in the product space retroactively once it's already been done we know that you know Hardware product roadmaps for example can be five years six years or longer you know software is a little bit easier but when it when it comes to trying to address um ensuring that everyone has an inclusive experience we have to make sure we're asking the right questions and taking the extra time that it takes to address uh those those things in mind so how how are we thinking about all of the possible users who will come in contact with this product right how do how do people who are differently abled engage with products how do people with big hair wear VR glasses right how do we think about these things to make sure that everyone is having an inclusive and Equitable experience we know that also in the regulatory space we do anticipate that there will be some government regulation that will require big Tech to address these things but we know that that may be some time off and we can't wait we can't wait to start thinking about these things that has to be done now it's not an option so for me um thinking about how we build an inclusive text future and what that looks like we're addressing these things and thinking about and and doing our due diligence to address issues on the front end before they actually arise yes yes thank you let's move on to Dr Patrice I'm just soaking it all and I'm learning from Leah and Joanne on this call this is good I would I gotta concur with what Leah is saying and for me and I think for an organization like BGC it's it's building the space and the opportunity for those who have been historically distant disadvantaged or disenfranchised the space to build and to innovate because the way you think about the big hair or braids or the way you think about the lighting on our darker skin tones you have to have a person of color in the room and are we giving those are we giving people that look like a space to innovate and to create and so I think we have been ostracized from a lot of different Industries and I think we're in this intersection where technology really needs to consider how they support and invite black folks in right um so we think about we are the answer to our to our issues right like you think about the gentleman who created the cop stop app right so we know that technology can be a solution for social issues but the only way we do that is if we allow us to be the folks that are doing that and I think not only do we need to be supported with mentorship but we got to start give us the money can I just let out say I want all the money and shout out to the CEO Sophia because I always say to her just give me the money right I'm always asking for the money and I think it is true for uh black creators and black Founders and black folks who are being Innovative and creating apps and um experiencing technology in new ways they need the money and the resources to build we need the same resources good brother Mark Zuckerberg had I want the same resource okay um so I think that is how we become more inclusive we need the space to create and we need the money and the resources to create yes yes um last but not least let's move on keep the conversation going let's add some some more volume Joanne okay yeah and and pretty much uh Leah and Patrice had you know said it and described it the only additional thing that I can add is uh volunteerism and Patrice mentioned mentorship of course so and that is a big thing that I truly believe in and and I do and in order you for various organizations you have to be in the room you know as as Patrice mentioned that's got that's very key so we've got to be there um and I know it can be hard sometimes you know if you're the only one in the room but you you have to you have to continue um you know being a part of the back to my what I said earlier you got to be a part of the solution you know not just uh you know identifying problems so that's the only way is uh we just gotta make room find find the space find a chair you know some where in the room in whatever organization within your company wherever you can in order uh you know to to be included and to be insured to be sure that that we're all especially black women you know are are included can I make one addition before we move on to the next question of course thanks Samantha um so in terms of uh career opportunities and thinking about different ways to address this question so as you know Samantha teed up for this question in particular the the technological ecosystem is made up of many different components and so there are opportunities in all of those different areas whether it be the educational sector the nonprofit sector the entrepreneurial sector so think about which from which angle you would like to contribute and then also think about um going into the policy space so in order to make sure we're equally dividing those resources and making giving access to resources like Dr Patrice mentioned we have to make sure that we have the right folks in those in those policy rooms and in the in on the hill and in different governmental spaces to be the voice and to Advocate to make sure that our communities are represented and we're making sure that there's Equitable access for for example for computer science programs funding for computer science as programs in public school systems and historically marginalized communities access to different resources for entrepreneurs Etc yes yes so true let's keep the conversation going and let's talk about challenges and realities um let's delve into a little bit the current challenges and how we can disrupt these uh systems of Oppression so with this first question so the effects of tech Innovation are immeasurable it significantly impacts our democracy our economy our society yet not all communities are benefiting equally from this Innovation we recently saw during this pandemic which spotlighted the Stark economic health education inequities um you know virtual learning for instance we saw instances where some communities had to I don't know go to to local uh open areas just to find WiFi just to be able to be a part of the the shift in learning we saw that a lot of infrastructures and cities didn't have anything available to make sure that all the students could equitably access anything the tech whether it's technology whether the hardware at home to the broader technology that they needed to connect with um what does it look like to innovate with accessibility and equity in mind what steps can we take to intentionally Center historically disadvantaged communities and we're going to start off with with Dr Patrice Johnson on that one so I love this question and I think it it what Leah has led us to in her last response definitely talks about it and I love that response Leah um I would say what gives me Paul's um is the infrastructure even if you look at the last week Jackson ain't got no water here in Detroit we had power outage for about four days so how can we say that we can equitably allow people to engage in technology when our infrastructure we are still like living in 1945 in some of our community we I mean we talk about basic water right now we ain't even talking about we ain't even talking about WiFi can I get good water can I get lights right um so so that's what right now kind of gives me pause to to think that our infrastructure primarily in urban communities has not been addressed so we're you're right and say the pandemic just exposed to the larger Community these um grave disadvantages right where kids who who are in urban cores don't have iPads and laptops like when you go to for example in Detroit is West Bloomfield they already have MacBooks at home in fact their parents had to buy the MacBook for them to start the class right that was post that was prepandemic so we are already Gravely behind right so I I think my vision or what I would love to see is can we start utilizing technology to give give me the basic things right now I don't think Jack I don't think folks in Jackson Mississippi really care about me giving them an iPad so that they can they can code or they can hack they need water and that's what just gives me great pause because it's not just Jack said it was Flint 10 years ago I mean so I don't know if I can adequately answer that question Samantha because I think the way I feel if I'm being authentic right now is I'm angry that my folks ain't got basic stuff so how can we innovate when the best creators don't even have water right now and and I you're gonna have to tag Lee and Joanne I can't even answer that yeah points were made yeah well I I can jump in with with something that we're doing at least with an IBL uh for two weeks but it's so interesting it's following you because um I'm from Mississippi my family is in Jackson so definitely you know they've been um impacted you know by the water situation just as you know across the others are are impacted as well but one thing and I think I mentioned earlier that I'm working on a team called call for code and so it definitely it takes it's not not IBM alone it's partnership with other you know other companies everybody needs to to um jump in and work on Solutions but with our call for code that is the overall idea it's open source working on some open source Solutions and that's pulling in like I said experience uh you know technologists uh designers people from Global all over the world to work on some of those Solutions and ironically for this year that the thief is sustainability so that really you know dives into the uh you know the the water you know issues the disparities education gaps um I would say back to to answer I think at the top of the question uh Leah had already covered it too I mean it's going to take legislative changes you know policy changes to really make a difference but I will say I mean the technology is there just the base technology I mean you got the software you got the hardware but it just takes uh a lot of us it's going to take everyone uh to really I think impact you know the the main issue I'm I'm with you I I get very angry as well because it's like yes we're doing things and you know others are doing things but the problem's still you know still remain and you can't you just can't affect it for everyone all at the same time it's moving you know too slowly for sure um but um you know together we can start making some impacts Leo that's great I totally agree um I I've also been thinking a lot about about Jackson and and what I can do to play my role to support the communities there um and it it really just gets to the Maslow's hierarchy of needs right so if you're very foundational needs as an individual are not being met as a community are not being met how can you get to that point of living in this ideal state where you can be your most creative your most Innovative if you don't have the basic necessities for life so that is something that we definitely need to think about but I will also say the other side of that is when things like this have happened people have come up with creative ideas of how do we filter the water to you know make it drinkable and different technologies that have come about as a as a result of kind of these um very uh impactful and devastating scenarios so um you know I think we all are thinking through kind of what we can do to support and and and thinking through what new Innovations might different scenarios Spark I I would add if that's okay Samantha I would add that one of the beautiful components of the work that we're doing is when you get uh for summer camp for example 50 girls in a room and they have that space again to create and we had a hackathon this year too uh it's a beautiful it's a beautiful experience it's the impact is it will floor you right because all of a sudden uh black girls are forming their own Community uh they're centering themselves around joy and they're creating these amazing apps that are that can solve real issues right so so I would say um although and I love your theoretical component Leah with Maslow's hierarchy of me but I think um although it does look dire there there are moments of Hope right that we can hold on to and for me I can reflect on those girls being at camp and the smiles on their faces and the way that they light up when they figured out how to do some stuff that I can't do um our education team will see they try to teach us how to code this art last week and I and my I had a stick figure right where our girls were creating these beautiful art images and so um there there is space for us to Hope right but I think we've got to put some pressure on the entire ecosystem from the legislators to these big companies to say we got to do some Grassroots basic stuff yeah so very true I think you've kind of answered this but we did have a question from the audience uh as someone who was breaking through barriers that's why it is so hard to get into the sector how does one find a breakthrough I think that this is going towards a breakthrough into career opportunities I believe that's what this is speaking towards I'll answer it from that lens um for me and it is not easy we know that things can often be more difficult for people who look like us even when we have the same credentials um my strategy I'll speak to my personal experience and my personal strategy my personal experience I've really honed in on something actually that Joanne mentioned earlier was being a constant learner how can I make sure that I am continuing to increase my heart skills my soft skills right so hard skills for this for this particular group would be things like making sure you're learning new coding languages if you can continuing to you know improve your skills those technical skills are so valuable in the industry maybe it's studying project management getting a project management certification um thinking and studying usercentered design user experiences design thinking those types of Prudential soft skills like public speaking um writing different things of relationship building um also networking and mentoring when we talked about mentoring earlier networking and building mutually beneficial relationships making sure that you're building relationships that aren't just meant to be transactional and seeking to get something out of it but also what can you give to the relationship how can it be something that's long term where you can support one another whether that's up here or maybe that's someone who is more experienced than you or has more knowledge so for me those have been ways that I have uh tried to continue to build on my resume but also open different doors to Opportunities and break down some of those barriers anyone would like to add well I think Leah has covered it but I mean Network attending events like this uh you know networking uh it's it's it's all about continuous learning you know as Leah um mentioned as well uh that's the way to if you're talking about breaking into different Industries or just breaking into anything Tech I will say I mean technology it runs the gamut so I mean whether it's in education uh you know it's in healthcare I mean government it's technology is everywhere so it's not really essentially breaking into technology but you do have to learn you know certain skills if it takes uh back to being you know data scientists you know python or R learning things like that um so that you just have to start you got Network you got to reach out uh use all the you know all the social media you know connections that that you can and just show up you know at events um and just ask for help and and you know it can happen thank you and also join those digital communities whether they're on Facebook or elsewhere um there are a lot of opportunities that are presented there are a lot of people that are willing to crowd uh Source resources answer your questions to support you in any way I know I've been an online uh communities like sister Circle black women in Tech where someone says I've just lost my job or I'm having this issue or I'm navigating this difficult conversation with my boss and folks are happily are willing to share their their expertise their experiences their connections so I think being in community can be a major way in which we break through these barriers let's keep it going um next question a reality of tech is that it can be used for good or bad we've seen Tech amplify social justice movements and help us utilize our Collective agency via social media we've also seen how racial and algorithmic biases in Tech can have negatively impacted specific communities via surveillance so surveillance or facial recognition software and even in in ways we're employed as we work toward Innovation how can future innovators intentionally keep the moral and ethical consequences of tech at the Forefront of their work whether it's government regulation or accountability policies let's start with you Joanne okay not to sound like a repeat record this is your broken record but I think Leah covered it you know already and we've talked about it it's essentially you you have to be in the room you need to be part of you know part of the solution uh put I would say one key thing is um taking the initiative to understand uh kind of see through the lens of those in disadvantaged areas or economically disadvantaged that that is going to be key in order to really make a difference and understand how to utilize the technology so technology can you know as as you say it can be it could be used for good for bad but it could be it's used for good mostly so but awareness is very key about like what is it really doing what what are the intended you know outcome and I know especially when you start talking about you know AI you know artificial intelligence I think that gets some people a real you know a little bit of free because it's like okay the you know robots are going to take over or whatever but you know behind those computers behind the robots they're humans so that's why it's very important that you have a diverse uh you know set of people in the room that's working on Solutions so if there's an opportunity for you to be a product manager you know that is very very key because you can really provide a lot of input in how that product is going to you know be developed and how it will eventually uh you know be deployed so so I would say that's key uh we do of course need more you know diverse uh people at the top because those are the ones that are making the decisions uh but so just continue back once again back to learning you know figuring out you know the various angles uh where you can can be in the room or you know at the table table even if you're not at the table you know once again just somewhere but making a contribution uh you know to the solution that I think that would that would be that's one of the key things that I think what what Joanne just said is so powerful because she gave us I will say this what we've seen with technology over the last 10 years um the ability to utilize social media as a form of activism right I believe I believe that a couple days after George Floyd was murdered it was like eight million tweets that use the hashtag black lives matter right so to be able to utilize social media in a way that can Galvanize folks and build a communication system across the globe right is immensely powerful I mean you think if they would have had that in in 68 right uh I think my My Hope has been how do you take that massive engagement and shift it from uh the social space to actual uh material change and I think what Joanne just said is exactly that I think she's saying for us to really utilize technology as a solution to some of the social experiences that we have how do we put our folks in a position like a product manager that could tell Apple don't you put out that phone and you know good and well the facial recognition is biased right it does not adequately see my skin tone and or um you have these new vehicles that are supposed to be selfdriving and you hitting black folks right because you don't recognize us um and I'm smiling but it's also it's it's not it's you know um so I love the fact that connecting both what Leah and Joanna is saying they are really diving on to Solutions right which which I adore um so how do we move from that matter massive way we can benefit from technology in the social space and engaging socially to the material change the material change and using technology as a solution for an app like cop stop or you know identifying as Leah said proactively the ways Tech can potentially be biased but solving those problems by having the right people in the spaces to make those decisions I totally agree I was going to mention product management I'm so glad that both of you already brought it up um I think particularly in this room that is specially curated for black women and girls it's important that we think about these types of careers where yes we are underrepresented however we bring a unique lens and unique experience to these types of roles right for a product manager or a technical program manager for example so in these types of positions you have a significant level of influence over the entire product development process from start to finish right you have the skill set to be able to understand and speak the language of the engineers and the technical folks working on the product while also translating for the people in the business who are driving um towards the you know the the business goals right and and you're the person who bridges that Gap and makes sure that along the way the right questions are being asked you know you're considering for all of the different factors that need to come into account and as black women we have a unique land through which we look at the world right and so and and you know we have that in common but we also have unique experiences right so what are your unique experiences that allow you to think about um how different people might engage with a product and ensuring that you you can be a voice in the room that say we need to diversify the the the data set and make sure we're including more users who of of X background right and making sure that all of that is considered along the way so definitely do consider um careers and in either you know technical program management or product management because as having that black girls cold technical Foundation is a great differentiator um even if you don't desire to be an engineer there are other opportunities and and um career paths that will allow you to still utilize that skill set and and uh you know kind of different differentiate you um amongst the the applicant pool for such roles yes yes um also if if anyone's interested in kind of learning more about this topic I'm in the middle of reading uh race after technology by ruha Benjamin um where they discussed abolitionist tools for the new gym code um and it goes into historical context current realities and future outlook um there's a lot of really good information in there that we can kind of equip ourselves to come to these tables and talk about these things utilizing broader data research and and just knowing the language to use as we discuss these things because these are ageold issues um that are now connected to farreaching Technologies so there's there's a lot of work to be done and I think all of us equipping ourselves being aware and not being afraid to adjust these Topics in any place in which we hold any amount of power or influence is important uh in the name of the book again because someone just asked is race after technology by ruha ruha treatment all right so let's keep the conversation moving let's talk about the progress and call to action circling back on your journey how have you seen progress in your sector what legacies Will Young innovators be building on and let's start with Leo sure um I think when I think about the Legacy um we've already touched on the fact that none of this is new our ancestors were extremely Innovative and creative people and we are products of their genius and keeping that in mind is one of the things that keeps me going um there's a a concept African concept of Sankofa you know understanding the past so that you can best forward and and drive towards the future um knowing our history and the shoulders upon which we stand uh is really important and also it keeps it keeps me going because this work is hard right if you choose to actually take a stand and be a person who wants to speak up and be that Agent of Change it can be challenging so along the way it's really important that we take care of ourselves right make sure that we're pouring into ourselves and that if we're not you know prioritizing our our Wellness physically mentally emotionally spiritually we can't do this work and so I really try to hone in on that um folks like Dr Benjamin who Samantha mentioned um there are just so many folks who are continuing to drive this work forward continue to study and read those books and think about um Dr Charlton McGowan has a book who talks about the black history and Technology you have to forgive me because I don't remember the name of the book but if you look up Dr Charles Charlton mcgillin it will come up um but just keep that in mind and that and that's something that keeps me grounded and keeps me going along this journey so that Legacy is very much important I think uh for me looking at the progress in the sector and what legacies we think young people will build on I go back to my experience with the girls over this summer we had technically six summer camps that uh I jokingly tell the team we were in it we don't know what happened with the rest of the world for those five camps five six camps but I will tell you um uh even though we might have been physically tired we were emotionally full because we we could see firsthand after not having inperson camps for two years or so because of covet you can see the way when a young lady gets it right when she's figured it out when she is able to um create something uh I mean we had girls at the Atlanta Camp during lunch time doing races with each other so I would say when we talk about their ability to innovate and the Legacy the legacy is um really about whole person development it is not only about the technology it is also about experiencing Joy it is about their leadership Journey right it is about community and then lastly as we like to say is also about economic Mobility right and and changing our material reality so for me that's what I see as the legacy of us continuing to encourage the girls that are on this call watching this session the uh you know five thousand ten thousand girls that will reach in a year those girls being able to form Community where they feel safe to create to experience their joy and and to to have the life that they want to live and and I'll just finish up uh Leah and Patrice you know have pretty much covered it as well um once again you know continuous learning I I would say the um the Advent of of there are so many ways of getting um getting upskilled getting educated you know getting a certifications getting badges just learning there's you know I don't want to advertise for different companies but you know like Coursera courses seeing a lot of precourses just a lot of online courses IBM by the way actually has a lot has a platform as well where continuous learning so definitely take advantage of all of those you know opportunities I think that is something that has progressed you know especially during my career I mean just so easy to to learn I mean we have a lot of internal learning but you know there are there are multiple uh external uh vehicles to learn from so I would say just incur urge just to continue uh continuous learning because that is going to to be key uh to the Future for the future innovators um the other thing is um wherever you are if there I mean if you are working or you know when you do start working uh there are various groups I think Leah touched on some there are different groups within companies you know the Affinity groups or the uh business resource groups uh that is very very key uh that wasn't available many many years ago so utilize those um you know vehicles uh you know to continue to innovate and learn as well I think that's that's the only additional uh thing I can can say I'll just add one last thing in terms of progress I do think that we have made tremendous progress even this is a very nascent space still when you think about inclusive technology or Equitable technology and conversations and resources around this um and so I think that there is tremendous opportunity to continue building and only amplify uh the work that has already been done so if I do want I did want to just circle back and acknowledge that I do think that um particularly in the last Maybe five or ten years there's been a lot of evolution growth and progress um and you know as Joanne mentioned that continuous learning allows you to kind of stay abreast and on the front curve of this ever evolving uh still growing and nascent uh space that we're in yeah I would agree with that yeah because technology as they say you know it doesn't stand still you know so it's continuing continuing to evolve yes I'd have to agree I would think what what's so beautiful is when you see just folks finding each other because they've been able to use different technology different platforms social media to find corners of the internet with people that they can relate to on multiple levels and start building together so in the way that um these inequalities the systemic issues exist you see so many individuals or even smaller Collective groups having even greater impact for their communities because they can leverage these Technologies they can leverage these tools they can selfeducate they can mobilize they can immediately respond they can get to the heart of these issues and have the conversation you don't need to feel alone you don't need to wonder if you're the only one thinking or wanting or creating you can find someone to create with across the street or across the world and as many issues as there are in this world there's individual Minds with a willingness to try to tackle them and no matter how niched or or how broad that is so like as we talk about progress and call to action a big part of what we're seeing now and what we saw during the pandemic and we when we saw we've seen in recent social justice movements as people being able to selfidentify uh mobilize and do the work wherever they are and that makes it more inclusive that makes it um uh more fast acting and that is something that I think will continue to be a powerful tool for further Generations even as you get into the metaverse even even as you think about how you're going to operationalize Future technology so get taking your seat at whatever table you can create not necessarily always having to um try to fight for a seat at someone else's table so so let's keep the conversation going what opportunities roles exist that uh to affect change in the tech space What should Young stemmists be doing now to build their way towards these impactful roles and what resources have been helpful in your journey yeah I'll jump in um I think we've touched touched a lot of different um areas of opportunity in the space whether that be in the private sector um in product technical program management project management um a user user experience design um engineering there there are so many um ways to address it in the private sector in the public sector there are opportunities at all level of government whether that and I know I mentioned the hill earlier but I will be remiss not to mention the importance of state and local government as well in ensuring access and advocacy um and access to resources for marginalized communities um there the the opportunities are are endless so it's really a matter of carving out the space and and figuring out what area you want to tackle and and also recognizing that you can change so I have done so many different things over the course of my relatively short career already because I've been trying to figure out and act that question of which way is the best path to address these very critical questions is it through the government is it through uh policy in the nonprofit sector is it actually being at the at the table or trying to pull up my own chair at the table in the private sector and in big Tech um so you know think about what what you might want to uh do and that uh breadth of experience also is very much a selling point when you come into any of those spaces being able to say well I've thought about it from this angle and I have experience that I can bring to the table from each of those different areas that's really important and that continuous Learning Journey definitely helps along the way with that yeah and and that very well said Leah and and I'll just add because I know we talked about you know product management project but any of those areas you know should be a focused data analyst just wherever you feel comfortable comfortable um and then from an industry uh as Leah I mean with the even though I've been with IBM but within there I've had uh opportunity to be exposed to various Industries within IBM so you know government Healthcare one of my
