00:00 - what's up brilliant coders it's your
00:02 - girl Jillian welcome back to video two
00:05 - of our mini series of coding animated
00:07 - art in our last video we created artwork
00:10 - centered around our identity and loving
00:12 - all of who we are including our natural
00:15 - hair I wanted to take that a step
00:17 - further and include all types of people
00:19 - and their wonderful hair textures hair
00:22 - can be an expression of our personal
00:24 - style and even our religious and
00:26 - cultural identities which is why I made
00:29 - this art that changes from an afro to a
00:32 - hijab to straight hair and I'm going to
00:34 - show you how to do it yourself so are
00:36 - you ready awesome let's get into it
00:39 - [Music]
00:45 - first let's start by adding an animation
00:48 - that includes afros of different sizes
00:51 - we are going to open up our previous
00:53 - piece of art and comment out our curls
00:56 - for now just so that we have the round
00:58 - afro when we comment out a section of
01:00 - code we make our code invisible and it
01:03 - can't be used or seen by our functions
01:06 - that means we'll no longer see the curls
01:09 - for now select the code you want to make
01:11 - invisible and then press command
01:14 - backslash if you are a Mac User or
01:17 - control backslash if you have PC
01:20 - now that the curls are commented out or
01:23 - temporarily hidden we have to think what
01:25 - we need to change in the code to make
01:27 - the afro go from large to small we need
01:31 - to adjust the width and height of the
01:33 - circle in our previous video we learned
01:36 - how stored values and variables can be
01:38 - used in different parts of our functions
01:41 - below curls let's create a variable
01:44 - called afro size that stores our current
01:47 - afro size of 380. next replace the value
01:51 - 380 in the afro Circle function with
01:54 - afro size
01:55 - if nothing changes then you have
01:58 - completed the step correctly now we want
02:00 - the afro size of the afro to shrink at a
02:04 - constant rate we can reuse our total sum
02:07 - operation to achieve this goal below
02:10 - Afro type afro size equals afro size
02:14 - minus one remember we are subtracting
02:17 - from the total size instead of adding to
02:20 - it like we did when we grew the curls of
02:23 - the afro because we want to make it
02:25 - smaller this way we'll see the afro
02:27 - shrink into infinity and then grow into
02:31 - Infinity so let's reset the afro size
02:34 - once we get to a certain size just like
02:37 - we did when the afro was growing to
02:39 - Infinity in our previous video below the
02:42 - afro size operation write the following
02:45 - if the afro size is less than 210 then I
02:48 - want to reset the afro size to 400. now
02:52 - we have an afro that shrinks to show all
02:55 - the different sizes it can be then
02:57 - resets itself to a size slightly larger
03:00 - than the original starting point even
03:03 - though I love afros and all of their
03:06 - Glory not everyone's hair grows that way
03:08 - or is worn that way so it's important
03:11 - for us to be able to have our art
03:13 - reflect a variety of hair types and
03:16 - hairstyles next in this piece we will
03:19 - show a woman with straighter hair and
03:21 - also a woman with a hijab which is a
03:23 - head covering worn by some Muslim women
03:25 - the way that I can do this is to comment
03:28 - out our afro section for now above it I
03:32 - will label straight hair slash hijab I
03:36 - want to draw a black rectangle that will
03:38 - span slightly larger than the width of
03:40 - the face
03:41 - we also have to adjust the hairline to
03:44 - span the width of the hair
03:45 - now let's shrink the afro while
03:48 - transitioning it to the hijab and
03:50 - eventually the straight hair
03:53 - I want to use the same logic we applied
03:55 - to shrink the afro to grow the straight
03:58 - hair this time we are changing the
04:01 - height of the rectangle to increase
04:02 - every time the draw function runs So
04:06 - Below the afro size variable I'm going
04:08 - to make a hair height variable and set
04:11 - its initial value to that of our
04:13 - rectangle height of 160. then replace
04:16 - 160 with hair height in the rectangle
04:19 - now I want the hair height to increase
04:22 - by half speed but you can change it to
04:24 - any speed you want I want the hair
04:26 - height to reset to 160 after it reaches
04:29 - a length of 300. now you see the hair
04:32 - height of the straight or hijab covered
04:35 - hair grow and grow until it reaches a
04:38 - length of 300 then it resets
04:41 - the next step is to uncomment the afro
04:44 - section and watch both animations at
04:47 - work
04:48 - [Music]
04:49 - hey that looks so dope
04:54 - well that's all the coding for today
04:56 - make sure you save your work
05:02 - now real talk major props to you for all
05:05 - of your hard work
05:07 - make sure to come back next week to
05:09 - learn how to take your animated art to
05:11 - the next level by adding moving
05:13 - animations to the background but in the
05:16 - meantime an in between time stay cute
05:19 - and stay coding
05:22 - foreign

what's up brilliant coders it's your girl Jillian welcome back to video two of our mini series of coding animated art in our last video we created artwork centered around our identity and loving all of who we are including our natural hair I wanted to take that a step further and include all types of people and their wonderful hair textures hair can be an expression of our personal style and even our religious and cultural identities which is why I made this art that changes from an afro to a hijab to straight hair and I'm going to show you how to do it yourself so are you ready awesome let's get into it first let's start by adding an animation that includes afros of different sizes we are going to open up our previous piece of art and comment out our curls for now just so that we have the round afro when we comment out a section of code we make our code invisible and it can't be used or seen by our functions that means we'll no longer see the curls for now select the code you want to make invisible and then press command backslash if you are a Mac User or control backslash if you have PC now that the curls are commented out or temporarily hidden we have to think what we need to change in the code to make the afro go from large to small we need to adjust the width and height of the circle in our previous video we learned how stored values and variables can be used in different parts of our functions below curls let's create a variable called afro size that stores our current afro size of 380. next replace the value 380 in the afro Circle function with afro size if nothing changes then you have completed the step correctly now we want the afro size of the afro to shrink at a constant rate we can reuse our total sum operation to achieve this goal below Afro type afro size equals afro size minus one remember we are subtracting from the total size instead of adding to it like we did when we grew the curls of the afro because we want to make it smaller this way we'll see the afro shrink into infinity and then grow into Infinity so let's reset the afro size once we get to a certain size just like we did when the afro was growing to Infinity in our previous video below the afro size operation write the following if the afro size is less than 210 then I want to reset the afro size to 400. now we have an afro that shrinks to show all the different sizes it can be then resets itself to a size slightly larger than the original starting point even though I love afros and all of their Glory not everyone's hair grows that way or is worn that way so it's important for us to be able to have our art reflect a variety of hair types and hairstyles next in this piece we will show a woman with straighter hair and also a woman with a hijab which is a head covering worn by some Muslim women the way that I can do this is to comment out our afro section for now above it I will label straight hair slash hijab I want to draw a black rectangle that will span slightly larger than the width of the face we also have to adjust the hairline to span the width of the hair now let's shrink the afro while transitioning it to the hijab and eventually the straight hair I want to use the same logic we applied to shrink the afro to grow the straight hair this time we are changing the height of the rectangle to increase every time the draw function runs So Below the afro size variable I'm going to make a hair height variable and set its initial value to that of our rectangle height of 160. then replace 160 with hair height in the rectangle now I want the hair height to increase by half speed but you can change it to any speed you want I want the hair height to reset to 160 after it reaches a length of 300. now you see the hair height of the straight or hijab covered hair grow and grow until it reaches a length of 300 then it resets the next step is to uncomment the afro section and watch both animations at work hey that looks so dope well that's all the coding for today make sure you save your work now real talk major props to you for all of your hard work make sure to come back next week to learn how to take your animated art to the next level by adding moving animations to the background but in the meantime an in between time stay cute and stay coding foreign
