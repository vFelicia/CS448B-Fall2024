00:40 - we're ready to create a new project open
00:43 - scratch and click file then new then we
00:46 - need to delete the cat Sprite since all
00:49 - of our Sprites for this project will be
00:50 - the letters of our name sorry cat click
00:53 - on the X in the circle above the cat to
00:55 - remove
00:56 - it next we need to make our project look
00:59 - a bit more interesting we need to choose
01:02 - a backdrop click on the backdrop icon in
01:05 - the bottom right corner I'm going to
01:09 - choose a colorful City you can make your
01:12 - backdrop whatever you want it to be now
01:15 - we can finally start adding the letters
01:17 - of our name to do this click on the
01:20 - choose a sprite from library button
01:22 - below the stage area I'm going to choose
01:25 - letters and choosing the first letter in
01:27 - my name k repeat the step for each
01:31 - letter in your name now I'm going to add
01:33 - blocks of code to each letter to animate
01:36 - them and make it fun for the letter K I
01:38 - think it would be really awesome if it
01:40 - could turn and circles again and again
01:42 - have a weird whirl effect let's click on
01:45 - the first letter and add an event block
01:47 - event blocks tell scratch when to start
01:49 - running the program by setting a
01:51 - triggering moment from the blocks
01:53 - palette go to events drag and drop the
01:56 - one green flag click block to the
01:58 - scripts area
02:00 - I'll add the turn right 15Â° block under
02:03 - the wind green flag click
02:05 - block turn blocks change the spites
02:08 - direction by a certain degree there are
02:10 - two turn blocks turn right and turn left
02:14 - let's also add a change color effect by
02:16 - 10 block under the first block then
02:19 - change the effect from color to
02:22 - wh if you keep clicking the green flag
02:25 - the letter will keep turning and
02:27 - transforming so I'm going to make it
02:29 - turn on its own add a repeat block from
02:32 - the control tab then put it around the
02:34 - chain and turn blocks add a weit point1
02:37 - seconds block above the change and turn
02:40 - blocks the weight block will control the
02:42 - speed of the turns I want the block to
02:45 - repeat a 100 times then clear graphic
02:48 - effects in scratch you can also make
02:50 - Sprites communicate when a message is
02:53 - broadcasted by one Sprite then the other
02:55 - Sprite or Sprites can receive the
02:57 - broadcasted message and perform a set of
03:00 - actions I'm also going to add a when the
03:03 - Sprite clicked and broadcast message and
03:05 - weight blocks to the scripts
03:08 - area you can add a special message to
03:11 - the broadcast block click on the message
03:14 - and then create new message I'm going to
03:17 - call it start letter
03:19 - [Music]
03:23 - A1 next I'm ready to program the letter
03:26 - A I want my letter A to kind of look
03:28 - like it's bouncing or gliding up and
03:30 - down when it receives a message from K I
03:33 - also want a to activate or tag the
03:36 - letter L which will then activate or tag
03:39 - the second letter a and so forth for the
03:42 - rest of my name it'll be like a chain of
03:45 - animations K tags a then a starts L then
03:49 - L starts the second a then n then I you
03:53 - get it to code this I'll click on the
03:55 - letter A in the Sprite pane then drag
03:58 - and drop when I receive my my message to
04:00 - the script area click on the message and
04:02 - a drop-down menu will show then select
04:05 - start letter
04:06 - A1 now let's make the first a move to
04:10 - make our Sprites or letters move we'll
04:13 - always go to the Motions tab on the
04:14 - Block palette we can use motion blocks
04:17 - to make our Sprite move turn Glide and
04:20 - change
04:22 - directions since I want my letter A to
04:24 - Glide I'll drag and drop two Glide 1
04:27 - seconds to X and Y and place them under
04:29 - under the first block I'm going to drag
04:32 - the a to the bottom of the
04:34 - stage then change the X and Y
04:37 - coordinance in the top block to match
04:39 - the ones in the Sprite
04:43 - pane I want the a to move up and down 20
04:47 - times so I'm going to wrap it in a
04:49 - repeat 20 times
04:53 - block okay now for the Finishing Touch
04:56 - getting letter A to start the animation
04:58 - for letter f
05:00 - this means just like we did for letter K
05:03 - to letter A I also need to add broadcast
05:06 - blocks that lets letter a talk to letter
05:09 - L to do this I'll drag and drop the when
05:12 - the Sprite click block to letter A in
05:15 - the Sprite
05:17 - [Music]
05:24 - Pane and change the message to start
05:26 - letter
05:28 - L
05:31 - then I'm going to drag and drop the when
05:33 - I received message block to the letter L
05:36 - below change the message to start letter
05:41 - L click the green flag and click letter
05:44 - K the letter K should whirl around like
05:47 - in a blender and when you click k a
05:50 - should move up and down 20
05:53 - times now I need to think of what action
05:56 - or animation I want to add to the letter
05:59 - s L I think I want the letter L to
06:02 - change colors and say L is For
06:05 - Love in L drag the when I received
06:08 - message block to the script area and
06:11 - change the message to start letter L in
06:13 - the control tab I'm going to add repeat
06:16 - five under the first block then drag and
06:18 - drop wait 3 seconds inside the repeat
06:21 - block so I can slow the speed of that
06:24 - Loop now I want to add change color
06:27 - effect by
06:28 - 25
06:32 - then add the say hello for 2 seconds
06:34 - block change hello to L is For
06:38 - Love Now test out L by clicking the
06:41 - first
06:43 - a that's cool but I want the L to do
