02:33 - Okay so
02:35 - we can get started with the Q and A and
02:39 - my first question for you guys is what
02:41 - is your web 3 orange Story how did you
02:44 - get into this space
02:48 - okay well I'll go first hi Flacco's code
02:52 - my name is Melissa Henderson I got into
02:55 - web3 from the content and the marketing
02:58 - side I was a journalist for 10 years I
03:02 - worked for Al Vogue Huffington Post and
03:04 - then I also did strategy so helping to
03:08 - drive revenue for a lot of the media
03:10 - businesses and I was really into
03:13 - Innovative technology so during the
03:15 - pandemic it was a platform called
03:17 - Clubhouse which I was an early adopter
03:19 - which means I was one of the first two
03:21 - 10 000 people on the app and I met it
03:24 - with a lot of Bitcoin Maxis as well as
03:27 - nft and ethereum developers and the rest
03:30 - is history I started my career really
03:33 - writing about tech in the intersection
03:35 - of Lifestyle
03:36 - um urban communities and the way it
03:38 - affects our lives and since then I have
03:41 - a crypto in a city column and I'm also
03:43 - the founder of the Violet burst which is
03:45 - a compilation of everything that I've uh
03:48 - ever wanted was ownership in my content
03:51 - as well as a Sleek interface and a way
03:54 - to interact with cryptocurrencies in a
03:56 - decentralized way
04:00 - I'll go next uh Hey everybody my name is
04:03 - Jasmine Brunson I'm a data scientist a
04:06 - DJ a Founder uh my my web3 origin story
04:10 - came from the movie dope so those of you
04:13 - out there who've seen that movie by
04:14 - shamik Moore I'm telling you I I just
04:17 - resonated with his character because I
04:19 - was a nerd in the hood you know growing
04:21 - up in the hood XYZ and at the time it
04:24 - was really hard to kind of teach people
04:25 - about certain things that I do python C
04:28 - plus plus people just thought I was just
04:30 - like weird you know in high school so
04:32 - um all this to say is I really resonated
04:34 - with his character and the segment that
04:36 - he spoke uh with his mom about Bitcoin
04:38 - and the way she just like asked the
04:40 - question she was like so we're going to
04:42 - be buying and selling things with math
04:43 - equations that just like struck me and
04:46 - ever since I went down a rabbit hole
04:47 - went to Virtual conferences in 2017 my
04:51 - first ever in-person conference was a
04:53 - black blockchain summit
04:54 - um and you know it's actually coming up
04:56 - at the end of this this month but my
04:59 - whole origin story into crypto has been
05:00 - doing the culture
05:05 - hello my name is Shayna I am a
05:09 - mechanical engineer by trade I work in
05:12 - Global Supply management so going
05:15 - overseas finding vendors I was at
05:17 - Microsoft making surface the tablets the
05:20 - touch display modules and then I
05:23 - transitioned over to Jewel managing a
05:25 - bunch of different components
05:26 - negotiating costs checking the factories
05:29 - making sure things are running smoothly
05:31 - um and then I met my now husband who was
05:34 - into blockchain nfts he was making
05:36 - digital Collectibles he had a token
05:39 - gated community that was giving each
05:42 - other support in terms of finding the
05:44 - right projects to invest in in
05:45 - communities
05:47 - um and he turned to me and he was like
05:49 - you're a woman in Tech like we need more
05:51 - of those
05:53 - um in the nft space and so it was just a
05:56 - prime opportunity this is about the last
05:58 - year I've been in um this space where I
06:01 - just dove in he started taking me to all
06:04 - the con conferences which is huge right
06:06 - when you get to meet people in the
06:08 - community behind the screens I met
06:11 - Jasmine through my travels I've seen
06:13 - Melissa speak I think at nft NYC so it's
06:16 - actually smaller than you would expect
06:17 - but
06:19 - um I ended up starting my own
06:20 - organization called nft CLT standing for
06:23 - Charlotte because that's where I'm
06:25 - living because
06:26 - one thing I'm I'm you know have been
06:29 - working in strategy for my whole career
06:30 - and the first thing I noticed is that
06:33 - um one of these events weren't happening
06:35 - in
06:36 - um you know the the in cities outside of
06:40 - the major hubs like Miami and New York
06:42 - so I knew that we needed in real life
06:43 - you know community building and
06:45 - education and some smaller markets and
06:49 - the other thing is you know I saw these
06:51 - conferences weren't catering towards
06:52 - Collegiate to gen Z to the folks who are
06:55 - going to be using this so we've been
06:57 - consistently we're coming up on our year
06:59 - anniversary we've had been consistently
07:01 - putting out programming and education
07:03 - and we're so excited for our y3k
07:06 - takeover tour that's happening January
07:08 - 23rd kicking off in Charlotte so if you
07:11 - are a Collegiate you have a free ticket
07:14 - to come earn nfts do workshops you have
07:17 - a web D Expo Gallery is going to be a
07:20 - great time and you can redeem those nfts
07:23 - for Merch and for our concert so
07:26 - celebration at the end of the conference
07:28 - so I love the space I will end with
07:31 - blockchain can solve so many problems in
07:33 - this world and that's what keeps me
07:35 - passionate about
07:37 - um staying active in this community
07:42 - hi everyone my name is oliinka odender
07:44 - and I am the founder of black women
07:46 - blockchain Council
07:48 - um I come to you by way of over 20 years
07:51 - in the financial industry I did
07:53 - transition into cyber security
07:55 - and I actually my origin story started
07:59 - when a friend told me about Bitcoin back
08:01 - in 2015 because I was in the financial
08:04 - industry I didn't really tap into the
08:06 - digital asset at that time however I did
08:09 - my research and I found out about
08:11 - blockchain and it was the technology
08:13 - that I actually gravitated towards
08:15 - because I saw that there were so many
08:17 - different opportunities for us as people
08:20 - with the technology there's so many use
08:22 - cases that could be built off of the
08:24 - technology and wanted to make sure that
08:26 - our people tap in uh so I created bwbc
08:30 - simply to educate our community about
08:33 - blockchain to raise awareness about it
08:35 - as well as to promote black women in
08:37 - this space I'm really excited to see all
08:39 - these wonderful speakers on this stage
08:42 - right now and the things that we're
08:44 - about to bring to you guys there's
08:46 - several opportunities that we're
08:48 - creating we're also creating courses to
08:50 - make sure that our women get to tap in
08:53 - not only as consumers but also
08:55 - developers so we have blockchain related
08:58 - courses education and also ability for
09:01 - you guys to build smart contracts which
09:03 - is another phase of the technology where
09:06 - you're able to build so many different
09:07 - projects I'm really excited to be here
09:11 - thank you all for sharing it's so
09:13 - important and really inspiring to hear
09:15 - about how you all got to where you are
09:18 - so hopefully our participants can ask a
09:21 - lot of questions because I want to know
09:23 - everything
09:25 - um but I think our next question is many
09:27 - of us are just finding out about web3
09:29 - and wondering what the big deal is what
09:31 - do you say to people who ask why should
09:33 - women of color be pivoting into web 3
09:35 - and why is it important that I get
09:37 - involved now
09:41 - I'll take this because I really love
09:44 - that question
09:45 - um crypto allows all of us to
09:47 - participate it doesn't care about your
09:49 - background it doesn't care about all the
09:52 - things that we had to nefariously deal
09:54 - with in the traditional Finance system
09:56 - whether it's through predatory lending
09:58 - it's through bad banking High appraisal
10:01 - rates because of this the color of your
10:03 - skin or your origin I feel like with
10:05 - Bitcoin it allows us to all participate
10:07 - and the beautiful thing about the space
10:09 - is the technology is inclusive the
10:12 - technology is inclusive we might not see
10:14 - all the inclusivity from the industry
10:16 - side but everyone can participate and I
10:19 - feel like a lot of the women in this
10:21 - stage can agree at the end of the day
10:23 - black women in this space women of color
10:25 - need to come to this space and kill it
10:28 - we're killing it in this game despite
10:30 - all of the obstacles we're killing it
10:32 - and I think the beautiful thing about
10:34 - decentralization the centralization in
10:37 - my context and from the things I've read
10:39 - is a matriarchal concept this
10:41 - decentralization in itself means that we
10:43 - all work together it's an all voluntary
10:46 - style of thinking enough and Technology
10:49 - we've been working in this space in
10:51 - terms of centralized you know uh
10:53 - identities and centralized structures
10:56 - like you talk about centralized storage
10:58 - and all these other things a lot of the
11:00 - power structures that play the big
11:02 - bosses the big businesses are you know
11:04 - pillaging people at the bottom
11:06 - decentralization and crypto and
11:08 - blockchain allows all of us to have
11:10 - ownership that's what web3 is it's the
11:13 - ownership economy and I think it's it's
11:15 - now or never when it comes to this phase
11:17 - and I'm saying I'm not saying it as in
11:19 - this is Alas and be all I'm saying it as
11:21 - in let's be urgent let's be urgent if
11:24 - you need help finding resources about
11:26 - Bitcoin and blockchain there's some
11:28 - amazing books out there one of my
11:29 - favorite books by Isaiah Jackson Bitcoin
11:32 - and Black America another book I really
11:34 - love blockchain the next everything by
11:36 - Stephen Williams there's tons of books
11:38 - out there there's tons of excerpts and
11:40 - it's amazing people in this space
11:41 - Facebook will sit down with you and go
11:44 - one-on-one about the origin of money why
11:47 - Fiat money is not that good XYZ so find
11:51 - your resources to find your niche
11:54 - yeah just to piggyback on um Jasmine's
11:58 - um the wonderful things that she said
11:59 - you know it really lie relies on
12:03 - ownership and it's important for us to
12:06 - show up in this space you know when the
12:09 - whole internet started we had web one
12:11 - and web one was all about reading all
12:14 - you could do was just read you could
12:16 - read your emails and I would say you
12:17 - couldn't really contribute as much web 2
12:19 - allowed us to now contribute we were
12:22 - able to write and some of you may
12:24 - remember my space where it really
12:26 - epitomized the whole concept of what two
12:28 - we were able to write and create on
12:30 - there now web3 the whole concept of what
12:33 - three is ownership now that we're able
12:36 - to write we can own what we write right
12:38 - and we could take that data or that
12:41 - information and put it anywhere that we
12:43 - choose to put it and at the same time we
12:46 - can make money so it's all about being
12:48 - able to control your data and it's
12:51 - important for us as black women to be
12:53 - able to do that as you all know when it
12:56 - comes to trends when it comes to
12:57 - Consumer ship we stand as number one we
13:00 - spend a lot of money on other people's
13:03 - uh expenses right and so this is our
13:06 - time to actually bring back that money
13:08 - to benefit us as people so it's very
13:11 - important for us to tap in
13:16 - thank you for those amazing amazing
13:18 - answers it's definitely inspiring to me
13:20 - in order to get into it through and my
13:23 - next question for you guys is how do you
13:24 - see web 360 appearing the innovation in
13:27 - the future particularly for marginal age
13:29 - communities
13:31 - I love to take this one
13:34 - um you know we talk about data ownership
13:36 - a lot in web 3 right and what data
13:39 - ownership is allowing is for wealth
13:42 - transfer because if you think about the
13:44 - big tech companies
13:45 - um and we talked about a little bit
13:46 - about web one right if you think about
13:48 - the internet what really makes the
13:50 - internet is the hardware right it's the
13:53 - cables wires routers data centers right
13:57 - that are built up and support the
13:59 - infrastructure for us to be able to
14:01 - connect on the internet so we think
14:02 - about Innovation what does that look
14:04 - like with web3 cut to web3 where you can
14:06 - start to own your data right you're
14:09 - making your own digital currency that is
14:12 - attached to that data and assets that
14:14 - are living on this decentralized
14:16 - internet now that we have the wealth I
14:19 - think the the opportunity that is at
14:22 - hand or you know is that wealth transfer
14:24 - but what do we do with it and it kind of
14:26 - goes as circular it goes back to that
14:28 - web one what we're going to have to
14:30 - figure figure out is how can we use
14:32 - those resources we've generated in web 3
14:34 - and translate that into real world
14:37 - ownership so you know part of
14:40 - decentralization is that you could set
14:42 - up your own computer to mine currency
14:45 - and to be a part of the infrastructure
14:47 - how do we do that as a community now
14:50 - right to generate wealth because you
14:52 - can't generate wealth by yourself that's
14:54 - a misconception it takes a community in
14:57 - order to do that and so when we think
14:59 - about the future we really should be
15:00 - thinking about okay I'm into space I own
15:02 - my data I have Assets Now real world who
15:05 - am I going to partner with to bring back
15:07 - manufacturing to bring back land
15:10 - ownership for our people right there's a
15:12 - Time the US was free so all of those
15:16 - um you know problems that we see in
15:19 - America particularly but all over the
15:20 - world right you know let's be timely
15:22 - think about the Queen's death there's a
15:24 - lot of talk about colonialism and the
15:26 - you know effects of what that did
15:28 - generationally this is a tool we have
15:31 - start to solve some of those problems
15:33 - and connect and reunite together
15:39 - I also wanted to add that with like
15:43 - Innovation you with web3 we're still
15:46 - building it so you can dream whatever
15:49 - you want to dream
15:51 - um there are hackathons that you can go
15:53 - to for free I'm happy to share those
15:56 - resources afterwards where you can say
15:58 - hey I want to build
16:01 - um a game on the blockchain and have it
16:04 - interact with my friends and you could
16:06 - have a team to collaborate with you
16:08 - build something like an actual prototype
16:11 - and get paid for it so Innovation is
16:14 - really borderless and it's it's all
16:18 - encompassing and so you could really
16:20 - think of the craziest idea go to
16:22 - hackathon go to a Meetup you know maybe
16:25 - write on the Reddit board and see who
16:27 - else is excited about your idea and
16:30 - that's how I kind of got into space as
16:32 - well and met all these amazing women and
16:35 - and people of color because I just
16:38 - wanted to innovate I was really tired
16:39 - rate of you know writing like five shoes
16:42 - you should wear you know to the concert
16:44 - like or corresponding with New York
16:47 - Fashion Week which is great but it
16:49 - wasn't really Innovative and if you want
16:51 - to challenge I think web3 is the perfect
16:53 - challenge because we're still building
16:55 - it the smart contracts might not be as
16:58 - robust right now but you could just help
17:01 - lend a hand and people you could
17:03 - actually get paid for it so that's one
17:04 - thing that I've also noticed too I got a
17:07 - developer Grant to
17:09 - um build my own platform and it was
17:12 - literally just filling out four
17:13 - questions and putting in the craziest
17:16 - ideas and they're like okay let's do it
17:18 - because it hasn't been done before so I
17:20 - think that's like the power of it and I
17:22 - think with black women we are
17:24 - intrinsically creative and there's a lot
17:27 - of people in the space that really uh
17:30 - really uh our our our our values are
17:35 - really heard in the space and even if
17:37 - they don't look like us they're really
17:39 - willing to help so you could be
17:41 - Innovative in web 3 because we're still
17:44 - building it uh short short answer
17:49 - thank you
17:51 - um thank you for sharing how important
17:53 - it is one for us to get involved and
17:55 - also all of the amazing opportunities
17:57 - there are for us in this space on the
18:00 - other side of that if we don't get
18:02 - involved what do you think are the
18:04 - implications of web3 on communities of
18:06 - color as it becomes more mainstream
18:10 - I'll I'll answer that I think the
18:13 - implication is that we repeat the same
18:16 - historical barriers that have always
18:19 - been in place
18:21 - um as you've heard from the ladies that
18:23 - this is an opportunity for us to jump in
18:25 - from the get-go right and be able to
18:27 - carve out a space for ourselves as well
18:30 - as carve out some protocols that benefit
18:32 - us as people so it's important for us to
18:35 - jump in but if we don't we stand the
18:37 - unfortunate you know um circumstances of
18:40 - repeating some of the barriers and
18:43 - issues that we've historically have
18:45 - encountered uh we know Silicon Valley
18:47 - right there was a time where they said
18:49 - that there was no black people that was
18:50 - interested in Tech right and so they use
18:53 - that model to basically keep us out and
18:57 - do gatekeeping
18:59 - um but now this is our opportunity to
19:01 - say no we're here and this is the way
19:04 - that we want to see it built
19:05 - um because if it's left to others
19:07 - they're going to build it to the way
19:09 - that it benefits them and not
19:11 - necessarily think on a global scale when
19:13 - we come in we get to add a little a lot
19:16 - more to it and start to get them to
19:18 - think outside of the box outside of
19:20 - their comfort zone and be able to
19:22 - actually cater this whole Space to
19:24 - everyone and it's important for it to be
19:26 - inclusive
19:28 - um and not divisive
19:31 - and just to piggyback off of that right
19:35 - um
19:36 - you know this opportunity right now to
19:40 - Melissa's point and olincas it's like
19:42 - we're so early in this space that
19:44 - there's a lot of room for Innovation
19:46 - we're not fully regulated that means you
19:49 - can get creative with problem solving
19:51 - and getting around you know Financial
19:53 - issues you know issues that were in the
19:55 - financial industry and all these
19:56 - different Industries music with
19:58 - ownership art with ownership
20:01 - um and so it's imperative
20:04 - um to ask Jasmine was saying that you
20:06 - see the urgency of the time right things
20:08 - happen in Cycles so you're not gonna see
20:11 - things the energy moving the same way
20:14 - you know come come the next time and web
20:17 - one experience well one used to be
20:19 - fairly decentralized and then
20:21 - governments started coming together
20:22 - institutions they created Frameworks and
20:24 - structures and to her point a lot of us
20:27 - were left out in that conversation this
20:30 - time around especially your age you have
20:33 - so much power you grew up with social
20:35 - media so we start thinking about social
20:37 - tokens branding yourself people
20:39 - investing in you and your skills
20:41 - personally and you managing your own
20:44 - funds and not need like it's a whole
20:46 - paradigm shift that's happening
20:49 - um but the reality is there are actors
20:51 - and players who don't want that paradigm
20:52 - shift to happen because that eats into
20:55 - their business that eats into their
20:57 - lunch and so um it's it's really
20:59 - critical I don't want to stress it too
21:02 - much but it is critical that you just
21:04 - start thinking what your interests are
21:06 - the industries that you want it to be in
21:08 - even if it's fashion Tech whatnot and
21:10 - think about how blockchain can transform
21:12 - those Industries
21:15 - okay
21:17 - oh I also wanted to add to that
21:19 - blockchain is a digital Ledger and so
21:22 - that means that we have the ability to
21:25 - like copyright everything that we have
21:28 - and really verify on the blockchain so
21:31 - my mission has always been to document
21:33 - the spirit and personality of urban
21:35 - creators on chain when you think about
21:38 - some of the your textbooks that you've
21:40 - read
21:41 - some of that history was probably left
21:43 - out from the Native Americans from some
21:45 - maybe your family history was left out
21:48 - that's because they didn't think it was
21:49 - relevant to have that type of
21:51 - information in your textbooks but now
21:54 - with blockchain and web3 we could have
21:56 - like for example my decentralized
21:58 - application which is called adapt I'm
22:00 - able to document creators all over the
22:03 - world because I think their story is
22:05 - necessary and it's on a blockchain
22:07 - called flow that is used by the NBA Top
22:10 - Shot so they can't erase this history
22:13 - because you can't erase anything on the
22:16 - blockchain another thing is web3 is
22:19 - about community building and a lot of us
22:21 - if you're non-technical you can get into
22:24 - the space through community building
22:25 - which is essentially building Community
22:28 - having events making sure people that
22:30 - look like you feel welcome to come in
22:33 - and that's that's what kind of
22:34 - gravitated me to the industry to things
22:37 - like Clubhouse because people were
22:38 - excited that someone that looked like me
22:40 - me was on the stages and they felt
22:43 - comfortable to talk and things so I
22:45 - think when we're left out of the
22:46 - conversation or the boardroom our
22:48 - ideologies and people that look like us
22:50 - aren't in the board rooms either because
22:53 - why because it's like assumed that
22:55 - because we're not there we don't care so
22:58 - you know getting as early as possible
23:00 - follow crypto Twitter follow
23:03 - um tell download telegram I know like 16
23:06 - year olds that have their own social
23:08 - tokens and have made a lot of money off
23:10 - of nfts you don't need to with a bank
23:13 - account you probably need your mom's
23:14 - signature with a metamask wallet you
23:17 - don't need anything so if you haven't
23:18 - met a mask wallet DM me and I'll send
23:21 - you some ease but only for the people
23:23 - that are here so we'll have to figure
23:25 - out how to verify that
23:29 - yeah if I can add some more you know as
23:33 - as women right we live our life in in a
23:37 - way that you know we're always thinking
23:39 - of innovation right and ways to improve
23:42 - things and I know you guys probably have
23:44 - you know thought of some process that
23:47 - you thought was ridiculous it could have
23:49 - been easy or simple or more effective
23:52 - right these are all the thought process
23:54 - that we need in this space if we need it
23:56 - from people that look like you
23:59 - um it's really important because there's
24:00 - certain things that you know we
24:02 - gravitate towards and you know certain
24:04 - things that we know can be improved on
24:06 - uh that we can lend our voices to also
24:10 - about our community because you've heard
24:12 - that word so many times there is this
24:14 - thing called decentralized autonomous
24:15 - organization right
24:18 - um doubts
24:19 - uh and so Dows you know allows us to now
24:23 - participate as a group as a community in
24:27 - order to improve something
24:29 - um you guys remember co-ops you know how
24:31 - the co-ops are able to come together
24:33 - collectively be able to vote on
24:36 - something and also improve that
24:37 - environment that that Co-op regulates is
24:41 - the same thing a dow is the same thing
24:42 - it's it's a it's a more
24:45 - um upgrade version of a co-op uh as a
24:48 - community we can vote on governance we
24:50 - can vote on the way that we maneuver and
24:52 - we structure ourselves you may recall uh
24:56 - what is it constitutional down it was a
24:58 - big frenzy that happened last year when
25:01 - a part of the well not a part but one of
25:04 - the Constitution a copy of the
25:05 - Constitution came up for auction there
25:08 - was a group of people all over the world
25:10 - collectively who came together to create
25:12 - the Constitutional dial and also give
25:15 - people across the globe an opportunity
25:17 - to tap into that in order to purchase
25:20 - the Constitution and unfortunately they
25:23 - weren't successful but they were able to
25:25 - collectively bring a group of people
25:27 - from all over the place with an intended
25:29 - purpose of owning that Dow now they're
25:33 - pivoting and trying to find other means
25:35 - to to work with that group but something
25:38 - like that could definitely benefit your
25:40 - community your block it could benefit
25:42 - you know your country it could benefit
25:44 - so many different even schools that you
25:47 - go to
25:48 - um so it's something like that that you
25:49 - need to start thinking of how you can
25:51 - show up how we as people can benefit
25:53 - from stuff like that imagine if someone
25:55 - created a dow for your block simply to
25:59 - improve the block to keep the crimes
26:01 - down uh to keep you know to keep deserts
26:04 - food deserts away and and implements
26:07 - Gardens these are things that people can
26:09 - feel like they're having a hand in
26:11 - building and improving the community and
26:14 - because of that they get like a token
26:15 - they get their voices heard they get to
26:17 - give their input and they get to feel
26:19 - like they're actually contributing to
26:21 - the community
26:22 - so blockchain is bringing all of that is
26:24 - bringing a way for us to show up and be
26:26 - represented
26:28 - thank you for those beautiful answers I
26:31 - know for me I was telling a lot of
26:32 - people that Tech cannot be inclusive if
26:34 - you're not inclusive within Tech and I
26:37 - think a lot is important for us black
26:38 - women especially to get involved in
26:40 - technology but my other question for you
26:43 - guys is web 3 is a safe space for all of
26:46 - us whether you're an artist a
26:47 - Storyteller or an engineer can you steer
26:49 - some career entrepreneurial
26:50 - opportunities that exist in the spaces
26:52 - for the masses and especially for black
26:54 - women as well
26:58 - I was going to say
27:00 - um this is black girls coat so I'm gonna
27:02 - assume everybody's coding everyone's a
27:04 - coder add solidity to your text tag add
27:07 - solidity at Russ at go
27:11 - um and and tap into creating smart
27:13 - contracts I think it was Melissa who
27:15 - said it earlier we're very early in this
27:16 - in this space and just to add those
27:20 - languages to your Tech stack is going to
27:22 - help you get more jobs and opportunities
27:23 - into crypto and then be around the
27:26 - ecosystem have your job literally pay
27:28 - for you to go to conferences and learn I
27:31 - think that's the next big thing for us
27:33 - to go ahead and like you know penetrate
27:35 - this this um this industry because a lot
27:38 - of these folks don't even know how to do
27:39 - smart contracts smart contracts yet and
27:42 - we're still early
27:43 - um and I think for me uh I just wanted
27:46 - to say like we we all agree that this
27:49 - space is inclusive and it's just a
27:51 - matter of taking that step to educate
27:53 - yourself right so already dropped a few
27:56 - books there's a couple um there's a
27:57 - couple radio shows podcasts uh YouTube
28:02 - videos out there I watch the gentleman
28:04 - of crypto
28:05 - um every week
28:06 - um and then I have a friend named crypto
28:09 - Kenzie who has his own podcast he did
28:11 - videos back in the day talking about
28:13 - tornado cash like you know what I mean
28:15 - so it's just a matter of finding like
28:18 - that need that Niche and someone said
28:20 - earlier that Twitter uh like uh crypto
28:22 - Twitter is a good Avenue too there's a
28:24 - there's some um there's some good value
28:26 - from that also crypto Twitter can be
28:28 - little iffy like a lot of maximalism is
28:31 - in there too so watch yourself with that
28:33 - but just make sure you ground yourself
28:35 - watch YouTube videos and um also I think
28:39 - that the I like the future of crypto in
28:43 - itself lies in the hands of the people
28:45 - like it's different from like all these
28:47 - other industries that we participated in
28:49 - this lies in the hands of the people who
28:50 - participate and the people who actually
28:52 - generate and and create content
28:55 - um olienka she said it earlier right web
28:57 - 2 was user generated content web3 is
29:00 - ownership economy so the the content
29:02 - that we create whether you're a podcast
29:04 - creator a designer a Enthusiast you like
29:09 - to sell like lemonade it doesn't matter
29:11 - put that on the blockchain create an nft
29:13 - sell it to your community give them
29:16 - rewards make them feel like hey like I
29:19 - want to stay here and I want to support
29:21 - XYZ person that's how we create that
29:24 - peer-to-peer that that uh producer to
29:26 - Consumer
29:27 - um uh interaction in architecture back
29:30 - like in web 2 we were literally
29:33 - subjugated to the Instagrams the metas
29:36 - the you know meta AKA Facebook I'm gonna
29:39 - call it Facebook because
29:40 - mama called it Facebook but like that's
29:43 - the thing like all these big data
29:46 - tycoons are literally leveraging our
29:48 - data just to create digital identities
29:50 - of us called Data doubles and that
29:53 - digital identity does not have anything
29:54 - anything they do about who you are and
29:57 - what you stand for it talks about per se
30:01 - your your proclivities online what
30:04 - keystrokes you have
30:06 - um what do you purchase what seasons do
30:08 - you do you do manic purchasing it's
30:12 - actually very very invasive and so um
30:15 - the three main applications for data
30:17 - mining always tell people is like uh
30:19 - targeted Marketing Online advertisements
30:22 - and recommendations for cross-selling
30:24 - that all involves one thing money and
30:27 - that money goes to the big businesses
30:29 - web 3 allows us to directly
30:31 - um uh serve our communities and serve
30:34 - our consumers
30:36 - awesome go ahead
30:39 - oh I just wanted to add to Jasmine in
30:42 - regard to data so there's a data uh
30:45 - platform called Dune analytics and you
30:48 - can go on chain and look at different
30:51 - blockchains like ethereum or or Arbitron
30:55 - so I think with what three careers like
30:57 - if you can demonstrate that you have an
30:59 - interest by if you're a data scientist
31:01 - and you know a new Python and writing
31:04 - queries check out doing analytics and
31:06 - put that on your resume if you're a
31:08 - writer start writing about crypto in a
31:10 - blog so anytime there's an nft
31:12 - collection out you be the go-to person
31:14 - as long as you can demonstrate that you
31:17 - have an interest in web 3 people are
31:20 - gonna love you another thing is like for
31:23 - me how I got into web create through my
31:25 - VR site so it wasn't like my education
31:28 - yes it was my education background but
31:30 - the founder to work in a startup was
31:32 - like oh I really like your VR site and I
31:34 - really love your crypto in a city blog
31:36 - so just having those ex having those uh
31:39 - examples on your resume is going to go
31:42 - far and just adding I work with a python
31:45 - developer framework called ape works so
31:48 - we have
31:49 - academy.apeworks.il so we're teaching
31:51 - you how to deploy smart contracts onto
31:54 - ethereum and other blockchains it's
31:58 - totally free and the video I mean if you
32:00 - spend about two hours a week with it
32:03 - you'll be able and you you know python
32:05 - or maybe you might not know python a lot
32:08 - of things just copying and paste just to
32:10 - save so
32:11 - um you know get a group together and
32:13 - start learning it start deploying your
32:15 - own contract and then you'll see and
32:17 - you'll see that a lot of opportunities
32:19 - are going to come to you because you're
32:21 - women in the space and there's no guys
32:23 - and the guys know that they're like okay
32:25 - we need to get women like who who can we
32:27 - connect to so there's a huge opportunity
32:30 - to build your career and make sure you
32:32 - have those those examples on your resume
32:36 - on your resume or your Twitter uh bio or
32:39 - your Instagram your bio so yeah
32:42 - yeah so I kind of want to touch from a
32:45 - different angle you know this space is
32:46 - about empowerment and giving you the
32:48 - tools you need to succeed and own your
32:50 - own data and Be Your Own Boss and um a
32:53 - lot of you I'm sure like active in nesby
32:55 - nationality of black Engineers I was
32:57 - president of my chapter all four years
32:59 - went hardcore and the thing nesby did
33:01 - for me was giving me my first
33:03 - opportunities right and career my first
33:05 - internship
33:06 - um was with visa and then Microsoft was
33:09 - um the next year and one thing I would
33:12 - encourage you you're you're in a unique
33:14 - time they call it like the the workers
33:16 - economy right this great resignation
33:18 - where people are leading traditional
33:20 - corporate jobs right they want more of a
33:22 - balance they want to the thing about you
33:25 - know I think traditional roles too they
33:27 - kind of pigeonholed you sometimes you
33:29 - you could be a multi-faceted Creator
33:31 - right you're not just the coder
33:34 - um and so but oftentimes in certain job
33:36 - roles you're seen as that so I would
33:38 - encourage you as you're maybe going to
33:40 - these conferences and talking to company
33:42 - who are coming on campus ask them you
33:44 - know where's blockchain on their roadmap
33:46 - are they looking at implementing soon I
33:49 - think about the banks Bank of America
33:51 - owns a bunch of patents in blockchain
33:54 - and they're trying to figure out how to
33:55 - implement now this is where you start to
33:57 - critically think okay so y'all are
33:59 - centralized entity this is a
34:02 - decentralized tool where do I really
34:04 - want to play what do I really stand for
34:07 - right in my career do I want to start on
34:10 - this side there's a ton of web 3
34:12 - companies right marketplaces the actual
34:15 - people who are developing uh d-apps to
34:18 - centralize apps on the blockchain people
34:21 - who are doing a lot of things with token
34:22 - economics right so that kind of like you
34:25 - guys are doing with the gamification but
34:27 - making that just an integral part of
34:29 - your internet experience so there's all
34:31 - these opportunities and you are really
34:34 - blessed to kind of be able to choose
34:36 - which world or if you want to do both I
34:38 - live in both I'm a Global Supply manager
34:40 - making products in a centralized world
34:41 - and I'm really passionate to have my own
34:43 - business in a decentralized world
34:46 - um that was able to be successful just
34:48 - because we're in this time where people
34:50 - do want women people are looking for
34:54 - um people who have technical expertise
34:56 - and can break down these Concepts very
34:59 - simply but definitely don't be afraid to
35:02 - ask the questions and really you know um
35:04 - get an understanding of how blockchain
35:06 - is going to affect the companies that
35:08 - you're looking at or the industries that
35:10 - you're expecting and then also I'll plug
35:12 - y3k takeover
35:14 - um the like I said the problem with a
35:16 - lot of these conferences is we have so
35:19 - many wonderful young adults in our
35:20 - community 1819 who maybe didn't even go
35:22 - to college but who code who couldn't
35:24 - come to nft NYC with us who couldn't
35:26 - come to these places because it's heavy
35:28 - drinking 21 plus
35:31 - um so why 3K takeover uh like I said
35:34 - we're kicking off January 23 in
35:36 - Charlotte North Carolina we will have a
35:37 - web 3 Expo so if you want to get in
35:40 - front of web3 comp companies and web 3
35:43 - organizations and communities looking
35:45 - for support and people you know to hire
35:48 - and bring on that's definitely something
35:51 - that you should check out
35:54 - yeah if I may add a little bit more to
35:59 - this um you know there are so many
36:01 - different resources uh nowadays compared
36:05 - to previously when I first started
36:09 - um as Jasmine mentioned you know
36:11 - learning solidity is very important
36:13 - because that's really the basis of all
36:15 - smart contract
36:17 - um and especially with the ethereum
36:18 - blockchain uh the ethereum blockchain is
36:21 - very famous you know everybody knows
36:23 - about it and one thing that we've done
36:25 - is we've partnered up with consensus
36:27 - which is part of the ethereum foundation
36:30 - to increase the number of black women
36:32 - blockchain devs it's very important
36:36 - um right now there's less than 0.001 of
36:39 - us that are black women who are
36:40 - developers in this space and there's a
36:42 - need for us as you guys have heard
36:44 - throughout this conference right now
36:46 - there's a need for us to show up and be
36:48 - represented so what we're doing is we're
36:50 - creating Pathways we have uh two courses
36:53 - that are going to be release and one is
36:56 - a non-technical course which will allow
36:58 - you just to understand what is
36:59 - blockchain like why is this important
37:01 - and also be able to apply it to certain
37:04 - aspects of your life and you know
37:06 - certain jobs as well because you don't
37:08 - always need a blockchain for everything
37:10 - but there are things that are being
37:12 - built with blockchain we want y'all to
37:14 - tap into why the other side is the Smart
37:18 - contract side we want you to roll up
37:20 - your sleeves and actually get to coding
37:22 - because once you start coding and
37:24 - understanding what goes into every line
37:26 - of code is very important you know the
37:28 - security aspect of the blockchain within
37:31 - itself the technology is secure but when
37:34 - humans interact with it that's when the
37:36 - security issues then to show up right so
37:39 - we want to make sure that you guys know
37:40 - that you don't have to copy and paste
37:42 - sorry Melissa but you could actually
37:44 - build it from scratch and when you're
37:46 - starting to build it from scratch you
37:48 - guys are going to start to think of
37:49 - different ways to improve the smart
37:51 - contract which is very important because
37:53 - there's a need to prove it but at the
37:56 - same time you will identify issues that
37:59 - have historically embedded into these
38:01 - open source smart contracts that always
38:04 - leads to issues and you will be able to
38:05 - address it and also a lot of projects
38:09 - are looking for smart contract Auditors
38:11 - and because you're able to build it from
38:14 - scratch you now know how to identify
38:17 - issues from other previous smart
38:20 - contract it's very important for us to
38:22 - tap in and we're creating that pathway
38:24 - with the subject matter experts that
38:27 - created a smart contract we want y'all
38:29 - to tap into that as well
38:31 - um other things are you know we are
38:33 - creating an international woman of
38:35 - blockchain conference and this
38:37 - blockchain conference is really to
38:39 - highlight women who are in the space
38:42 - because you guys don't know but people
38:45 - still assume it's a tech bro space and
38:47 - it's not there's a lot of women that are
38:49 - in the space that are building that are
38:51 - creating that are adding to this
38:53 - blockchain ecosystem system that we're
38:55 - creating and we want to feature them
38:57 - this past um March we did 31 days of
39:02 - women-led speakers
39:04 - women speakers offer all 31 days three
39:07 - and a half hours a day for the entire
39:10 - week entire 31 days we feature women who
39:13 - are in this space from all walks of life
39:16 - over 20 countries just to show
39:18 - representation and that we're here we're
39:21 - taking that concept and actually
39:22 - bringing it to the DC area for one week
39:25 - in March we will go ahead and feature
39:27 - all women speakers again we're inviting
39:30 - all sorts of companies within this space
39:33 - we're going to have networking
39:34 - opportunities job fair opportunities and
39:37 - we're also tapping into the metaverse
39:39 - because the menavers don't want to leave
39:40 - that out is very important in this whole
39:43 - ecosystem that we're building and our
39:45 - people it's important for us to show up
39:47 - and be able to represent and also be
39:49 - able to either find jobs or create and
39:52 - get the right type of funding so we want
39:54 - y'all to tap into that and you can go to
39:57 - um
39:58 - bwbc.io to find out more information
40:03 - you're talking about code each
40:06 - blockchain has its own language
40:07 - programming language so ethereum is
40:10 - possible but we're you know I'm sorry
40:12 - it's the most popular but there's
40:14 - opportunities to decentralized space so
40:16 - if there's a language that you're
40:18 - comfortable with like I've sat in and
40:20 - learning how JavaScript can be you know
40:23 - a programming language on blockchain too
40:25 - Solana has its own flow has its own so
40:28 - that's just something to be mindful as
40:30 - well you have um different ecosystems to
40:33 - play in
40:34 - yeah for sure for sure I wanted to add
40:37 - really quick so um going off what you
40:39 - were saying earlier there is a network
40:41 - called the the blockchain education
40:43 - Network I was a part of when I was at
40:45 - University of Maryland I think anybody
40:47 - who's a high schooler or a college
40:49 - student or what have you joined the
40:50 - blockchain education Network connect
40:52 - with them uh great Gods I've been with
40:55 - them since I think it was like 2019 they
40:57 - they flew us out to the North American
40:58 - Bitcoin conference so that's a good way
41:01 - to kind of merge yourself into the
41:04 - conferences that go go around and also
41:06 - get your you know your flight paid or
41:08 - also get your conference ticket paid and
41:11 - then also just to go off of Ola yinka
41:13 - what she was saying so I'm a Founder in
41:15 - the webview security space I wanted to
41:17 - push you all as you learn your smart
41:19 - contracts as you learn those languages
41:21 - also learn how to audit there's a couple
41:23 - of spaces bug Bounty programs out of out
41:27 - here it's kind of similar to like a
41:28 - hackathon where whereas you're not going
41:30 - to be pitching an app you're going to be
41:32 - more so finding bugs and code so it's
41:34 - called code Farina check it out code for
41:36 - arena I'm gonna put it in the chat and
41:38 - also immunify that's a great way to
41:40 - learn how to like Buck find bugs and
41:44 - code and also get paid and then they
41:46 - also will put you on the leaderboard and
41:48 - you get that exposure from the community
41:50 - and once you get once you get that
41:52 - exposure that proves your validity in
41:54 - the space so definitely work on finding
41:57 - the bugs and Coke because we've lost a
41:58 - lot of money in in other sectors of
42:01 - crypto such as decentralized finance and
42:03 - not decentralized Finance is traditional
42:05 - Financial Services put on a blockchain
42:07 - like uh exchanges funding derivatives
42:09 - XYZ there's a lot of opportunity we lost
42:12 - 16 billion dollars in the past two years
42:14 - so those of you who are going down that
42:16 - rabbit hole learning solidity and
42:18 - everything like that also touching
42:19 - auditing and I'm here to support you let
42:21 - me know if you ever need any any
42:23 - um any type of mentorship I'm here to
42:25 - support you
42:28 - thank you so much
42:30 - um I know that that was a lot of
42:32 - information and that you all have been
42:33 - dropping these incredible gems of advice
42:36 - and resources for all of our
42:39 - participants here today
42:41 - um I think we're going to do one more
42:42 - question before we move on to the Q a
42:44 - portion
42:46 - um and that is just what is a final
42:48 - piece of advice you have for someone
42:50 - looking to get started and if you could
42:53 - share a resource that was imperative to
42:55 - your success moving from web 2 to web 3.
43:02 - sorry
43:08 - um I was gonna say that you know
43:11 - um this space is all about not sitting
43:14 - on the sideline but jumping in you know
43:17 - a lot of people have the assumption that
43:19 - they really need to know everything
43:21 - about the space before they even show up
43:23 - and participate and that's wrong
43:26 - um when you're sitting from the
43:27 - sidelines and you're looking in it kind
43:29 - of looks chaotic but when you jump in
43:30 - and actually get your feet wet you start
43:32 - to realize oh wow okay now I understand
43:34 - this I understand what people are saying
43:36 - about decentralization I understand what
43:38 - people are saying about communities and
43:40 - there's a lot of resources we've already
43:42 - dropped some of them right now but
43:44 - there's a lot of resources that you can
43:45 - tap into and get that solid foundation
43:48 - uh one more thing that I like to plug is
43:51 - crypto zombies if you want to know what
43:53 - solidity is or you know what exactly you
43:56 - know this whole word that we're talking
43:58 - about is and how it fits into you as
44:01 - coders I'll go ahead and look up crypto
44:04 - zombies and I'll put it in the chat
44:06 - um but it's a way to identified way of
44:09 - introducing you to solidity introducing
44:12 - you to what goes into it what exactly is
44:14 - it so that that way that fear that you
44:16 - have about I don't know this may not be
44:18 - for me you can really start to
44:20 - understand oh this isn't that hard you
44:22 - know I can do this you know and get that
44:24 - confident that you need and that way you
44:26 - can start jumping in and getting a
44:28 - little bit more information there's a
44:29 - wealth of information out there but as
44:32 - you've seen from these ladies and myself
44:33 - we have communities that are waiting to
44:36 - assist you in your journey so tap into
44:39 - it
44:42 - can you asked a question again I forgot
44:45 - no worries just could you give a one
44:48 - final piece of advice to anyone who's
44:49 - looking to get started or any resources
44:52 - that were really helpful to you in this
44:54 - space
44:55 - oh yeah
44:56 - um how to get started how to get started
44:58 - um research on your own because a lot of
45:01 - these institutions don't really like
45:03 - academic institutions They Don't Really
45:05 - teach crypto and if they do you have to
45:07 - have like your prerequisite for comp
45:09 - sign and some people who don't even
45:11 - study compsite who want to learn more
45:12 - about blockchain if you are like on
45:15 - campus and everything like that see if
45:17 - there's a blockchain club in your school
45:20 - and if there's not start be the Pioneer
45:22 - start it even if you're still learning
45:24 - start it because you're going to attract
45:26 - so many people that's going to support
45:28 - you and then you can join the blockchain
45:29 - education Network and get you guys's uh
45:32 - your your expenses paid when you go to
45:34 - conferences
45:35 - um and then in terms of resources
45:37 - YouTube University that's how I learned
45:39 - my city smart contracts that's how I
45:41 - learned like YouTube University I'm
45:43 - telling you it's so it's so rich the
45:46 - information there and then also just
45:48 - going like step by step of why smart
45:51 - contracts exist x y z all you need that
45:54 - context I actually like understand that
45:57 - you know as as you're building you as a
46:01 - builder have value I think we've kind of
46:03 - lost that sometimes in business it's
46:05 - like sometimes developers aren't even
46:07 - seen as like the the gods that we are
46:09 - like you know what I mean like it's
46:11 - always a Biz Dev people and the people
46:12 - who bring in the money but at the end of
46:15 - the day if you don't have the developers
46:16 - if you're not if you don't have the
46:18 - coders what's being built what's the
46:20 - product so uh YouTube University for
46:23 - sure and um and then also just like just
46:27 - reach out and find your community I feel
46:29 - I feel like it's like that's a very
46:31 - interesting thing to say but like once
46:32 - you have your community you have like
46:34 - that one set of crypto friends you're
46:36 - bouncing from conference to conference
46:37 - with before you know it you're going to
46:39 - be like relatively renowned and known in
46:42 - this space and and also you know mingle
46:44 - with people so that's my that's my
46:46 - tidbit
46:53 - I'll go
46:55 - um so you may have heard of the term
46:58 - white papers
47:00 - um so when you're getting into this
47:01 - space and you're looking at blockchains
47:03 - and you're looking at tokens they're
47:05 - gonna be there's some mini names white
47:07 - green they've kind of iterated the biz
47:09 - Dev people took over what used to be
47:10 - very technical papers that explain the
47:14 - mechanism behind the blockchain and why
47:16 - it worked and how it was validating
47:18 - transaction
47:19 - kind of got has gotten watered down in
47:21 - the process so just the tip you know as
47:24 - you're evaluating projects you may want
47:26 - to invest in or projects you want to
47:28 - invest in I.E communities you want to
47:30 - join right because that's a huge
47:31 - component the reason why nft projects
47:34 - are accessible or the reason why people
47:36 - believe in a certain cryptocurrency is
47:39 - because of the community that's behind
47:40 - it
47:41 - um check the credentials check the
47:43 - Carfax you don't have to understand
47:45 - everything but it should read technical
47:48 - right I think about the people who are
47:50 - doing like Progressive work in nfts
47:52 - smart contracts um the developers I know
47:55 - they take it very seriously right what
47:58 - type of tokenomics mechanisms they're
48:00 - implementing and they make it clear like
48:03 - for their Community how they're doing it
48:04 - it's not just a bunch of marketing tool
48:07 - you're not just going to hear like oh
48:10 - um shark like there's some key words
48:13 - um I think there's another one
48:14 - um yeah that just people it's like a lot
48:17 - of fluff right a little staking more
48:20 - money yeah a lot of Shilling a lot of
48:22 - fluff so just I guess what I'm saying is
48:24 - get your third eye open this space there
48:27 - is not a lot of safety nets right
48:29 - um and we're dealing with finances we're
48:31 - dealing with data we're dealing with
48:33 - your assets uh so make sure that you are
48:37 - very clear on your kind of intuition get
48:41 - get into like does this feel right does
48:43 - this community seem like they have real
48:45 - resources is this you know a technical
48:48 - piece of work that um has a strong
48:51 - Foundation
48:52 - um and that I think will serve you well
48:54 - as you're navigating the space
49:00 - yeah I like to say crypto question
49:02 - everything like just questioned
49:05 - everything everyone is a suspect to me
49:07 - until prove it innocent especially
49:11 - online because a lot of people are
49:12 - synonymous so just question everything
49:14 - and go go into it with a curious sense
49:17 - and a curious lens and you'll succeed
49:22 - amazing thank you so much
49:25 - um this was really insightful and I know
49:27 - that our participants have so much
49:30 - information and resources that they can
49:33 - take with them after this session I we
49:36 - have a couple questions but first I
49:38 - wanted just to ask you all if you could
49:41 - drop any of the books or the resources
49:43 - that you shared during this session into
49:46 - the chat so that our students have them
49:49 - and then
49:51 - we have uh time for two questions before
49:55 - we move on to our closing
49:58 - um so first could you tell us what
50:00 - surprised you most about web3 or
50:03 - blockchain as you are entering the space
50:04 - and this uh question comes from Diana
50:11 - um I think for me as a writer what
50:13 - surprised me is that Engineers are
50:15 - creators and they are writers as well so
50:19 - I come at it from kind of a
50:20 - non-technical
50:21 - angle but I really felt I really feel
50:24 - like storytelling has a huge part of
50:27 - web3 and it's something that is missing
50:29 - because there's a there was a lot of
50:30 - misconceptions about crypto prior to
50:34 - women get involved in the space because
50:36 - we are a natural Storyteller so that was
50:38 - like really surprising talking to um the
50:41 - devs a lot of the team I'm pretty much
50:43 - the only female on the team only writers
50:46 - so they really lean on me for
50:48 - copyrighting for storytelling for
50:50 - translating their their code into
50:52 - something that's applicable and is a use
50:55 - case so I was really surprised that I
50:56 - could add value in that sense
50:59 - was the question what surprised Us in
51:01 - the space
51:03 - yes
51:06 - um I think what surprised me honestly
51:07 - was like
51:09 - you know I think as a builder in this
51:12 - space or someone who is active in the
51:13 - community I don't think we think about
51:15 - y'all generation and uh gen Z and
51:17 - younger like it blows my mind like even
51:20 - when we talk about metaphors and things
51:22 - like that I just feel like it's a little
51:24 - bit out of touch and not culturally
51:25 - relevant but y'all went through covid
51:28 - trying to navigate school you know
51:30 - ending your senior years trying to
51:32 - navigate your first years of college
51:33 - like behind the screen so you know in
51:37 - terms of folks that we need to be when
51:40 - we talk about inclusion
51:42 - we have such a lack of inclusion in
51:45 - terms of like a younger generation and
51:47 - it's definitely a generational Gap so
51:49 - that's something that shook me and I'm
51:51 - trying to fix I have a 17 year old
51:52 - brother so I've been onboarding him into
51:54 - this space and man y'all pick it up
51:56 - quicker than us we we on board when the
51:58 - tick tockers our local like social media
52:00 - influencer gave them 50 bucks in each
52:03 - this man flipped it overnight into 500
52:06 - like just doing a little after you know
52:08 - doing a session with him and taking some
52:09 - back of the notes so
52:11 - um I really hope to see like you guys
52:14 - get more active and build your own
52:16 - communities in safe spaces and I look
52:18 - forward to supporting that
52:24 - I would say for me what surprised me is
52:27 - the variance in the spaces like in terms
52:30 - of the groups that there are there could
52:33 - be like people who are just artists it
52:36 - could be people who are devs crypto Bros
52:38 - it's communities for everyone even if
52:41 - you feel like the the industry isn't
52:43 - like that inclusive you're gonna find
52:45 - your Niche you're gonna find your group
52:46 - of people that you rock with I think
52:48 - that's what surprised me and then also
52:50 - how unorthodox crypto is I went to a
52:53 - conference uh not so long ago by storage
52:55 - Institute and it was for uh Founders
52:57 - young Founders in this space young VCS
53:00 - XYZ and it was in Minnesota and when I
53:03 - tell you that was the most
53:04 - unconventional conventional crypto
53:06 - conference I've ever been to I mean we
53:08 - broke out the conference and did yoga in
53:10 - the in the forest just randomly I'm like
53:13 - man I didn't know I needed this I'm all
53:15 - healed up I hear I heard the sound of
53:18 - the didgeridoo my all my skin is popping
53:21 - all this stuff crypto is so beautiful
53:24 - when you find the right people I feel
53:26 - like it's about finding the right people
53:28 - and I think Melissa said it sifting
53:29 - through the madness sifting through the
53:31 - chaos there's some Bad actors in this
53:33 - space you have to do your due diligence
53:34 - and do your own research but the best
53:36 - additive to doing your own research is
53:38 - knowing somebody who actually knows what
53:40 - they're talking about they'll they'll be
53:42 - able to guide you through the chaos The
53:44 - Madness by Dogecoin buy Dogecoin is
53:47 - going to the Moon they'll be able to
53:49 - help you with that because there's a lot
53:51 - of Bad actors in this space whether it's
53:52 - the institutions or individual uh uh
53:55 - individual players you got to watch
53:57 - yourself and always remember you want to
53:59 - accumulate crypto in the sense of like
54:01 - accumulating Bitcoin with a a Bitcoin
54:04 - forward mindset all the other cryptos I
54:07 - mean you got to do your research to
54:08 - figure out what's what what's good for
54:10 - you uh polygon uh ethereum XYZ tezos but
54:15 - Bitcoin you want to accumulate as much
54:17 - Bitcoin as possible because it's only
54:19 - going to be 21 million ever
54:21 - 21 million we gotta we're in a rush so
54:24 - that's my last tipit for you guys
54:26 - for me I would say initially what
54:29 - surprised me was the fact that this
54:31 - wasn't just um allocated to the U.S this
54:34 - is a global uh movement that's happening
54:37 - right now we call it Revolution uh we're
54:39 - shifting people's mind we're Shifting
54:41 - the way that we think and the way that
54:42 - we operate and do things in this space
54:45 - um I would say the same thing continues
54:47 - to surprise me because now we got the
54:48 - government coming in right they're
54:50 - creating their own Central Bank digital
54:52 - currency we have all kinds of industry
54:54 - in this space and soon enough the whole
54:56 - entire world will be operating
54:59 - um some way of fashion through
55:00 - blockchain and um you know I want we
55:03 - want our people to tap into that so it's
55:06 - just the quickness of how things move
55:09 - you know
55:10 - um we we say we're still we're still new
55:12 - we're still young things are still you
55:14 - know in the early stages and it really
55:16 - is still in the early stages but just by
55:19 - tapping in and being involved you're
55:21 - realizing that they've moved in warp
55:23 - speed
55:24 - um and the things that you thought you
55:26 - knew is now different things are
55:28 - changing now we have what is it so bound
55:31 - nfts which basically companies are
55:34 - looking at creating a self-identity a
55:36 - self-sovereignty identity ID such as a
55:40 - driver's license you may have your
55:41 - driver's license as an nft and so bound
55:44 - nft just means you can't transfer it to
55:46 - anyone so it stays with you forever so
55:48 - things like that continues to surprise
55:50 - me in this space
55:58 - thank you for all your insights so I'm
56:00 - gonna ask the best way for our
56:02 - participants to stay in touch with you
56:03 - guys and thank you all for attending

information I'm going to follow up with a bit of housekeeping rules so just so everyone knows all sessions are being recorded and will be available on the alumni portal following the conference if you have a question for our speakers please type it in the Q a box at the bottom of the video Yasmin and I will relay them to our speakers during the Q a at the end of the presentation if you are experiencing any technical issues during your session please click the tech support button at the bottom left corner of the screen for support so we can help you out and for the best viewing experience we suggest using Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge as your browser so if you'd like to hop off and come back just so that it's um a better experience you should do that now and now I'm going to hand it back over to Yasmin so she can introduce our amazing speakers yes now it's my pleasure to introduce you to our speakers Melissa Henderson Shauna Douglas engineer Jasmine burnson Okay so we can get started with the Q and A and my first question for you guys is what is your web 3 orange Story how did you get into this space okay well I'll go first hi Flacco's code my name is Melissa Henderson I got into web3 from the content and the marketing side I was a journalist for 10 years I worked for Al Vogue Huffington Post and then I also did strategy so helping to drive revenue for a lot of the media businesses and I was really into Innovative technology so during the pandemic it was a platform called Clubhouse which I was an early adopter which means I was one of the first two 10 000 people on the app and I met it with a lot of Bitcoin Maxis as well as nft and ethereum developers and the rest is history I started my career really writing about tech in the intersection of Lifestyle um urban communities and the way it affects our lives and since then I have a crypto in a city column and I'm also the founder of the Violet burst which is a compilation of everything that I've uh ever wanted was ownership in my content as well as a Sleek interface and a way to interact with cryptocurrencies in a decentralized way I'll go next uh Hey everybody my name is Jasmine Brunson I'm a data scientist a DJ a Founder uh my my web3 origin story came from the movie dope so those of you out there who've seen that movie by shamik Moore I'm telling you I I just resonated with his character because I was a nerd in the hood you know growing up in the hood XYZ and at the time it was really hard to kind of teach people about certain things that I do python C plus plus people just thought I was just like weird you know in high school so um all this to say is I really resonated with his character and the segment that he spoke uh with his mom about Bitcoin and the way she just like asked the question she was like so we're going to be buying and selling things with math equations that just like struck me and ever since I went down a rabbit hole went to Virtual conferences in 2017 my first ever inperson conference was a black blockchain summit um and you know it's actually coming up at the end of this this month but my whole origin story into crypto has been doing the culture hello my name is Shayna I am a mechanical engineer by trade I work in Global Supply management so going overseas finding vendors I was at Microsoft making surface the tablets the touch display modules and then I transitioned over to Jewel managing a bunch of different components negotiating costs checking the factories making sure things are running smoothly um and then I met my now husband who was into blockchain nfts he was making digital Collectibles he had a token gated community that was giving each other support in terms of finding the right projects to invest in in communities um and he turned to me and he was like you're a woman in Tech like we need more of those um in the nft space and so it was just a prime opportunity this is about the last year I've been in um this space where I just dove in he started taking me to all the con conferences which is huge right when you get to meet people in the community behind the screens I met Jasmine through my travels I've seen Melissa speak I think at nft NYC so it's actually smaller than you would expect but um I ended up starting my own organization called nft CLT standing for Charlotte because that's where I'm living because one thing I'm I'm you know have been working in strategy for my whole career and the first thing I noticed is that um one of these events weren't happening in um you know the the in cities outside of the major hubs like Miami and New York so I knew that we needed in real life you know community building and education and some smaller markets and the other thing is you know I saw these conferences weren't catering towards Collegiate to gen Z to the folks who are going to be using this so we've been consistently we're coming up on our year anniversary we've had been consistently putting out programming and education and we're so excited for our y3k takeover tour that's happening January 23rd kicking off in Charlotte so if you are a Collegiate you have a free ticket to come earn nfts do workshops you have a web D Expo Gallery is going to be a great time and you can redeem those nfts for Merch and for our concert so celebration at the end of the conference so I love the space I will end with blockchain can solve so many problems in this world and that's what keeps me passionate about um staying active in this community hi everyone my name is oliinka odender and I am the founder of black women blockchain Council um I come to you by way of over 20 years in the financial industry I did transition into cyber security and I actually my origin story started when a friend told me about Bitcoin back in 2015 because I was in the financial industry I didn't really tap into the digital asset at that time however I did my research and I found out about blockchain and it was the technology that I actually gravitated towards because I saw that there were so many different opportunities for us as people with the technology there's so many use cases that could be built off of the technology and wanted to make sure that our people tap in uh so I created bwbc simply to educate our community about blockchain to raise awareness about it as well as to promote black women in this space I'm really excited to see all these wonderful speakers on this stage right now and the things that we're about to bring to you guys there's several opportunities that we're creating we're also creating courses to make sure that our women get to tap in not only as consumers but also developers so we have blockchain related courses education and also ability for you guys to build smart contracts which is another phase of the technology where you're able to build so many different projects I'm really excited to be here thank you all for sharing it's so important and really inspiring to hear about how you all got to where you are so hopefully our participants can ask a lot of questions because I want to know everything um but I think our next question is many of us are just finding out about web3 and wondering what the big deal is what do you say to people who ask why should women of color be pivoting into web 3 and why is it important that I get involved now I'll take this because I really love that question um crypto allows all of us to participate it doesn't care about your background it doesn't care about all the things that we had to nefariously deal with in the traditional Finance system whether it's through predatory lending it's through bad banking High appraisal rates because of this the color of your skin or your origin I feel like with Bitcoin it allows us to all participate and the beautiful thing about the space is the technology is inclusive the technology is inclusive we might not see all the inclusivity from the industry side but everyone can participate and I feel like a lot of the women in this stage can agree at the end of the day black women in this space women of color need to come to this space and kill it we're killing it in this game despite all of the obstacles we're killing it and I think the beautiful thing about decentralization the centralization in my context and from the things I've read is a matriarchal concept this decentralization in itself means that we all work together it's an all voluntary style of thinking enough and Technology we've been working in this space in terms of centralized you know uh identities and centralized structures like you talk about centralized storage and all these other things a lot of the power structures that play the big bosses the big businesses are you know pillaging people at the bottom decentralization and crypto and blockchain allows all of us to have ownership that's what web3 is it's the ownership economy and I think it's it's now or never when it comes to this phase and I'm saying I'm not saying it as in this is Alas and be all I'm saying it as in let's be urgent let's be urgent if you need help finding resources about Bitcoin and blockchain there's some amazing books out there one of my favorite books by Isaiah Jackson Bitcoin and Black America another book I really love blockchain the next everything by Stephen Williams there's tons of books out there there's tons of excerpts and it's amazing people in this space Facebook will sit down with you and go oneonone about the origin of money why Fiat money is not that good XYZ so find your resources to find your niche yeah just to piggyback on um Jasmine's um the wonderful things that she said you know it really lie relies on ownership and it's important for us to show up in this space you know when the whole internet started we had web one and web one was all about reading all you could do was just read you could read your emails and I would say you couldn't really contribute as much web 2 allowed us to now contribute we were able to write and some of you may remember my space where it really epitomized the whole concept of what two we were able to write and create on there now web3 the whole concept of what three is ownership now that we're able to write we can own what we write right and we could take that data or that information and put it anywhere that we choose to put it and at the same time we can make money so it's all about being able to control your data and it's important for us as black women to be able to do that as you all know when it comes to trends when it comes to Consumer ship we stand as number one we spend a lot of money on other people's uh expenses right and so this is our time to actually bring back that money to benefit us as people so it's very important for us to tap in thank you for those amazing amazing answers it's definitely inspiring to me in order to get into it through and my next question for you guys is how do you see web 360 appearing the innovation in the future particularly for marginal age communities I love to take this one um you know we talk about data ownership a lot in web 3 right and what data ownership is allowing is for wealth transfer because if you think about the big tech companies um and we talked about a little bit about web one right if you think about the internet what really makes the internet is the hardware right it's the cables wires routers data centers right that are built up and support the infrastructure for us to be able to connect on the internet so we think about Innovation what does that look like with web3 cut to web3 where you can start to own your data right you're making your own digital currency that is attached to that data and assets that are living on this decentralized internet now that we have the wealth I think the the opportunity that is at hand or you know is that wealth transfer but what do we do with it and it kind of goes as circular it goes back to that web one what we're going to have to figure figure out is how can we use those resources we've generated in web 3 and translate that into real world ownership so you know part of decentralization is that you could set up your own computer to mine currency and to be a part of the infrastructure how do we do that as a community now right to generate wealth because you can't generate wealth by yourself that's a misconception it takes a community in order to do that and so when we think about the future we really should be thinking about okay I'm into space I own my data I have Assets Now real world who am I going to partner with to bring back manufacturing to bring back land ownership for our people right there's a Time the US was free so all of those um you know problems that we see in America particularly but all over the world right you know let's be timely think about the Queen's death there's a lot of talk about colonialism and the you know effects of what that did generationally this is a tool we have start to solve some of those problems and connect and reunite together I also wanted to add that with like Innovation you with web3 we're still building it so you can dream whatever you want to dream um there are hackathons that you can go to for free I'm happy to share those resources afterwards where you can say hey I want to build um a game on the blockchain and have it interact with my friends and you could have a team to collaborate with you build something like an actual prototype and get paid for it so Innovation is really borderless and it's it's all encompassing and so you could really think of the craziest idea go to hackathon go to a Meetup you know maybe write on the Reddit board and see who else is excited about your idea and that's how I kind of got into space as well and met all these amazing women and and people of color because I just wanted to innovate I was really tired rate of you know writing like five shoes you should wear you know to the concert like or corresponding with New York Fashion Week which is great but it wasn't really Innovative and if you want to challenge I think web3 is the perfect challenge because we're still building it the smart contracts might not be as robust right now but you could just help lend a hand and people you could actually get paid for it so that's one thing that I've also noticed too I got a developer Grant to um build my own platform and it was literally just filling out four questions and putting in the craziest ideas and they're like okay let's do it because it hasn't been done before so I think that's like the power of it and I think with black women we are intrinsically creative and there's a lot of people in the space that really uh really uh our our our our values are really heard in the space and even if they don't look like us they're really willing to help so you could be Innovative in web 3 because we're still building it uh short short answer thank you um thank you for sharing how important it is one for us to get involved and also all of the amazing opportunities there are for us in this space on the other side of that if we don't get involved what do you think are the implications of web3 on communities of color as it becomes more mainstream I'll I'll answer that I think the implication is that we repeat the same historical barriers that have always been in place um as you've heard from the ladies that this is an opportunity for us to jump in from the getgo right and be able to carve out a space for ourselves as well as carve out some protocols that benefit us as people so it's important for us to jump in but if we don't we stand the unfortunate you know um circumstances of repeating some of the barriers and issues that we've historically have encountered uh we know Silicon Valley right there was a time where they said that there was no black people that was interested in Tech right and so they use that model to basically keep us out and do gatekeeping um but now this is our opportunity to say no we're here and this is the way that we want to see it built um because if it's left to others they're going to build it to the way that it benefits them and not necessarily think on a global scale when we come in we get to add a little a lot more to it and start to get them to think outside of the box outside of their comfort zone and be able to actually cater this whole Space to everyone and it's important for it to be inclusive um and not divisive and just to piggyback off of that right um you know this opportunity right now to Melissa's point and olincas it's like we're so early in this space that there's a lot of room for Innovation we're not fully regulated that means you can get creative with problem solving and getting around you know Financial issues you know issues that were in the financial industry and all these different Industries music with ownership art with ownership um and so it's imperative um to ask Jasmine was saying that you see the urgency of the time right things happen in Cycles so you're not gonna see things the energy moving the same way you know come come the next time and web one experience well one used to be fairly decentralized and then governments started coming together institutions they created Frameworks and structures and to her point a lot of us were left out in that conversation this time around especially your age you have so much power you grew up with social media so we start thinking about social tokens branding yourself people investing in you and your skills personally and you managing your own funds and not need like it's a whole paradigm shift that's happening um but the reality is there are actors and players who don't want that paradigm shift to happen because that eats into their business that eats into their lunch and so um it's it's really critical I don't want to stress it too much but it is critical that you just start thinking what your interests are the industries that you want it to be in even if it's fashion Tech whatnot and think about how blockchain can transform those Industries okay oh I also wanted to add to that blockchain is a digital Ledger and so that means that we have the ability to like copyright everything that we have and really verify on the blockchain so my mission has always been to document the spirit and personality of urban creators on chain when you think about some of the your textbooks that you've read some of that history was probably left out from the Native Americans from some maybe your family history was left out that's because they didn't think it was relevant to have that type of information in your textbooks but now with blockchain and web3 we could have like for example my decentralized application which is called adapt I'm able to document creators all over the world because I think their story is necessary and it's on a blockchain called flow that is used by the NBA Top Shot so they can't erase this history because you can't erase anything on the blockchain another thing is web3 is about community building and a lot of us if you're nontechnical you can get into the space through community building which is essentially building Community having events making sure people that look like you feel welcome to come in and that's that's what kind of gravitated me to the industry to things like Clubhouse because people were excited that someone that looked like me me was on the stages and they felt comfortable to talk and things so I think when we're left out of the conversation or the boardroom our ideologies and people that look like us aren't in the board rooms either because why because it's like assumed that because we're not there we don't care so you know getting as early as possible follow crypto Twitter follow um tell download telegram I know like 16 year olds that have their own social tokens and have made a lot of money off of nfts you don't need to with a bank account you probably need your mom's signature with a metamask wallet you don't need anything so if you haven't met a mask wallet DM me and I'll send you some ease but only for the people that are here so we'll have to figure out how to verify that yeah if I can add some more you know as as women right we live our life in in a way that you know we're always thinking of innovation right and ways to improve things and I know you guys probably have you know thought of some process that you thought was ridiculous it could have been easy or simple or more effective right these are all the thought process that we need in this space if we need it from people that look like you um it's really important because there's certain things that you know we gravitate towards and you know certain things that we know can be improved on uh that we can lend our voices to also about our community because you've heard that word so many times there is this thing called decentralized autonomous organization right um doubts uh and so Dows you know allows us to now participate as a group as a community in order to improve something um you guys remember coops you know how the coops are able to come together collectively be able to vote on something and also improve that environment that that Coop regulates is the same thing a dow is the same thing it's it's a it's a more um upgrade version of a coop uh as a community we can vote on governance we can vote on the way that we maneuver and we structure ourselves you may recall uh what is it constitutional down it was a big frenzy that happened last year when a part of the well not a part but one of the Constitution a copy of the Constitution came up for auction there was a group of people all over the world collectively who came together to create the Constitutional dial and also give people across the globe an opportunity to tap into that in order to purchase the Constitution and unfortunately they weren't successful but they were able to collectively bring a group of people from all over the place with an intended purpose of owning that Dow now they're pivoting and trying to find other means to to work with that group but something like that could definitely benefit your community your block it could benefit you know your country it could benefit so many different even schools that you go to um so it's something like that that you need to start thinking of how you can show up how we as people can benefit from stuff like that imagine if someone created a dow for your block simply to improve the block to keep the crimes down uh to keep you know to keep deserts food deserts away and and implements Gardens these are things that people can feel like they're having a hand in building and improving the community and because of that they get like a token they get their voices heard they get to give their input and they get to feel like they're actually contributing to the community so blockchain is bringing all of that is bringing a way for us to show up and be represented thank you for those beautiful answers I know for me I was telling a lot of people that Tech cannot be inclusive if you're not inclusive within Tech and I think a lot is important for us black women especially to get involved in technology but my other question for you guys is web 3 is a safe space for all of us whether you're an artist a Storyteller or an engineer can you steer some career entrepreneurial opportunities that exist in the spaces for the masses and especially for black women as well I was going to say um this is black girls coat so I'm gonna assume everybody's coding everyone's a coder add solidity to your text tag add solidity at Russ at go um and and tap into creating smart contracts I think it was Melissa who said it earlier we're very early in this in this space and just to add those languages to your Tech stack is going to help you get more jobs and opportunities into crypto and then be around the ecosystem have your job literally pay for you to go to conferences and learn I think that's the next big thing for us to go ahead and like you know penetrate this this um this industry because a lot of these folks don't even know how to do smart contracts smart contracts yet and we're still early um and I think for me uh I just wanted to say like we we all agree that this space is inclusive and it's just a matter of taking that step to educate yourself right so already dropped a few books there's a couple um there's a couple radio shows podcasts uh YouTube videos out there I watch the gentleman of crypto um every week um and then I have a friend named crypto Kenzie who has his own podcast he did videos back in the day talking about tornado cash like you know what I mean so it's just a matter of finding like that need that Niche and someone said earlier that Twitter uh like uh crypto Twitter is a good Avenue too there's a there's some um there's some good value from that also crypto Twitter can be little iffy like a lot of maximalism is in there too so watch yourself with that but just make sure you ground yourself watch YouTube videos and um also I think that the I like the future of crypto in itself lies in the hands of the people like it's different from like all these other industries that we participated in this lies in the hands of the people who participate and the people who actually generate and and create content um olienka she said it earlier right web 2 was user generated content web3 is ownership economy so the the content that we create whether you're a podcast creator a designer a Enthusiast you like to sell like lemonade it doesn't matter put that on the blockchain create an nft sell it to your community give them rewards make them feel like hey like I want to stay here and I want to support XYZ person that's how we create that peertopeer that that uh producer to Consumer um uh interaction in architecture back like in web 2 we were literally subjugated to the Instagrams the metas the you know meta AKA Facebook I'm gonna call it Facebook because mama called it Facebook but like that's the thing like all these big data tycoons are literally leveraging our data just to create digital identities of us called Data doubles and that digital identity does not have anything anything they do about who you are and what you stand for it talks about per se your your proclivities online what keystrokes you have um what do you purchase what seasons do you do you do manic purchasing it's actually very very invasive and so um the three main applications for data mining always tell people is like uh targeted Marketing Online advertisements and recommendations for crossselling that all involves one thing money and that money goes to the big businesses web 3 allows us to directly um uh serve our communities and serve our consumers awesome go ahead oh I just wanted to add to Jasmine in regard to data so there's a data uh platform called Dune analytics and you can go on chain and look at different blockchains like ethereum or or Arbitron so I think with what three careers like if you can demonstrate that you have an interest by if you're a data scientist and you know a new Python and writing queries check out doing analytics and put that on your resume if you're a writer start writing about crypto in a blog so anytime there's an nft collection out you be the goto person as long as you can demonstrate that you have an interest in web 3 people are gonna love you another thing is like for me how I got into web create through my VR site so it wasn't like my education yes it was my education background but the founder to work in a startup was like oh I really like your VR site and I really love your crypto in a city blog so just having those ex having those uh examples on your resume is going to go far and just adding I work with a python developer framework called ape works so we have academy.apeworks.il so we're teaching you how to deploy smart contracts onto ethereum and other blockchains it's totally free and the video I mean if you spend about two hours a week with it you'll be able and you you know python or maybe you might not know python a lot of things just copying and paste just to save so um you know get a group together and start learning it start deploying your own contract and then you'll see and you'll see that a lot of opportunities are going to come to you because you're women in the space and there's no guys and the guys know that they're like okay we need to get women like who who can we connect to so there's a huge opportunity to build your career and make sure you have those those examples on your resume on your resume or your Twitter uh bio or your Instagram your bio so yeah yeah so I kind of want to touch from a different angle you know this space is about empowerment and giving you the tools you need to succeed and own your own data and Be Your Own Boss and um a lot of you I'm sure like active in nesby nationality of black Engineers I was president of my chapter all four years went hardcore and the thing nesby did for me was giving me my first opportunities right and career my first internship um was with visa and then Microsoft was um the next year and one thing I would encourage you you're you're in a unique time they call it like the the workers economy right this great resignation where people are leading traditional corporate jobs right they want more of a balance they want to the thing about you know I think traditional roles too they kind of pigeonholed you sometimes you you could be a multifaceted Creator right you're not just the coder um and so but oftentimes in certain job roles you're seen as that so I would encourage you as you're maybe going to these conferences and talking to company who are coming on campus ask them you know where's blockchain on their roadmap are they looking at implementing soon I think about the banks Bank of America owns a bunch of patents in blockchain and they're trying to figure out how to implement now this is where you start to critically think okay so y'all are centralized entity this is a decentralized tool where do I really want to play what do I really stand for right in my career do I want to start on this side there's a ton of web 3 companies right marketplaces the actual people who are developing uh dapps to centralize apps on the blockchain people who are doing a lot of things with token economics right so that kind of like you guys are doing with the gamification but making that just an integral part of your internet experience so there's all these opportunities and you are really blessed to kind of be able to choose which world or if you want to do both I live in both I'm a Global Supply manager making products in a centralized world and I'm really passionate to have my own business in a decentralized world um that was able to be successful just because we're in this time where people do want women people are looking for um people who have technical expertise and can break down these Concepts very simply but definitely don't be afraid to ask the questions and really you know um get an understanding of how blockchain is going to affect the companies that you're looking at or the industries that you're expecting and then also I'll plug y3k takeover um the like I said the problem with a lot of these conferences is we have so many wonderful young adults in our community 1819 who maybe didn't even go to college but who code who couldn't come to nft NYC with us who couldn't come to these places because it's heavy drinking 21 plus um so why 3K takeover uh like I said we're kicking off January 23 in Charlotte North Carolina we will have a web 3 Expo so if you want to get in front of web3 comp companies and web 3 organizations and communities looking for support and people you know to hire and bring on that's definitely something that you should check out yeah if I may add a little bit more to this um you know there are so many different resources uh nowadays compared to previously when I first started um as Jasmine mentioned you know learning solidity is very important because that's really the basis of all smart contract um and especially with the ethereum blockchain uh the ethereum blockchain is very famous you know everybody knows about it and one thing that we've done is we've partnered up with consensus which is part of the ethereum foundation to increase the number of black women blockchain devs it's very important um right now there's less than 0.001 of us that are black women who are developers in this space and there's a need for us as you guys have heard throughout this conference right now there's a need for us to show up and be represented so what we're doing is we're creating Pathways we have uh two courses that are going to be release and one is a nontechnical course which will allow you just to understand what is blockchain like why is this important and also be able to apply it to certain aspects of your life and you know certain jobs as well because you don't always need a blockchain for everything but there are things that are being built with blockchain we want y'all to tap into why the other side is the Smart contract side we want you to roll up your sleeves and actually get to coding because once you start coding and understanding what goes into every line of code is very important you know the security aspect of the blockchain within itself the technology is secure but when humans interact with it that's when the security issues then to show up right so we want to make sure that you guys know that you don't have to copy and paste sorry Melissa but you could actually build it from scratch and when you're starting to build it from scratch you guys are going to start to think of different ways to improve the smart contract which is very important because there's a need to prove it but at the same time you will identify issues that have historically embedded into these open source smart contracts that always leads to issues and you will be able to address it and also a lot of projects are looking for smart contract Auditors and because you're able to build it from scratch you now know how to identify issues from other previous smart contract it's very important for us to tap in and we're creating that pathway with the subject matter experts that created a smart contract we want y'all to tap into that as well um other things are you know we are creating an international woman of blockchain conference and this blockchain conference is really to highlight women who are in the space because you guys don't know but people still assume it's a tech bro space and it's not there's a lot of women that are in the space that are building that are creating that are adding to this blockchain ecosystem system that we're creating and we want to feature them this past um March we did 31 days of womenled speakers women speakers offer all 31 days three and a half hours a day for the entire week entire 31 days we feature women who are in this space from all walks of life over 20 countries just to show representation and that we're here we're taking that concept and actually bringing it to the DC area for one week in March we will go ahead and feature all women speakers again we're inviting all sorts of companies within this space we're going to have networking opportunities job fair opportunities and we're also tapping into the metaverse because the menavers don't want to leave that out is very important in this whole ecosystem that we're building and our people it's important for us to show up and be able to represent and also be able to either find jobs or create and get the right type of funding so we want y'all to tap into that and you can go to um bwbc.io to find out more information you're talking about code each blockchain has its own language programming language so ethereum is possible but we're you know I'm sorry it's the most popular but there's opportunities to decentralized space so if there's a language that you're comfortable with like I've sat in and learning how JavaScript can be you know a programming language on blockchain too Solana has its own flow has its own so that's just something to be mindful as well you have um different ecosystems to play in yeah for sure for sure I wanted to add really quick so um going off what you were saying earlier there is a network called the the blockchain education Network I was a part of when I was at University of Maryland I think anybody who's a high schooler or a college student or what have you joined the blockchain education Network connect with them uh great Gods I've been with them since I think it was like 2019 they they flew us out to the North American Bitcoin conference so that's a good way to kind of merge yourself into the conferences that go go around and also get your you know your flight paid or also get your conference ticket paid and then also just to go off of Ola yinka what she was saying so I'm a Founder in the webview security space I wanted to push you all as you learn your smart contracts as you learn those languages also learn how to audit there's a couple of spaces bug Bounty programs out of out here it's kind of similar to like a hackathon where whereas you're not going to be pitching an app you're going to be more so finding bugs and code so it's called code Farina check it out code for arena I'm gonna put it in the chat and also immunify that's a great way to learn how to like Buck find bugs and code and also get paid and then they also will put you on the leaderboard and you get that exposure from the community and once you get once you get that exposure that proves your validity in the space so definitely work on finding the bugs and Coke because we've lost a lot of money in in other sectors of crypto such as decentralized finance and not decentralized Finance is traditional Financial Services put on a blockchain like uh exchanges funding derivatives XYZ there's a lot of opportunity we lost 16 billion dollars in the past two years so those of you who are going down that rabbit hole learning solidity and everything like that also touching auditing and I'm here to support you let me know if you ever need any any um any type of mentorship I'm here to support you thank you so much um I know that that was a lot of information and that you all have been dropping these incredible gems of advice and resources for all of our participants here today um I think we're going to do one more question before we move on to the Q a portion um and that is just what is a final piece of advice you have for someone looking to get started and if you could share a resource that was imperative to your success moving from web 2 to web 3. sorry um I was gonna say that you know um this space is all about not sitting on the sideline but jumping in you know a lot of people have the assumption that they really need to know everything about the space before they even show up and participate and that's wrong um when you're sitting from the sidelines and you're looking in it kind of looks chaotic but when you jump in and actually get your feet wet you start to realize oh wow okay now I understand this I understand what people are saying about decentralization I understand what people are saying about communities and there's a lot of resources we've already dropped some of them right now but there's a lot of resources that you can tap into and get that solid foundation uh one more thing that I like to plug is crypto zombies if you want to know what solidity is or you know what exactly you know this whole word that we're talking about is and how it fits into you as coders I'll go ahead and look up crypto zombies and I'll put it in the chat um but it's a way to identified way of introducing you to solidity introducing you to what goes into it what exactly is it so that that way that fear that you have about I don't know this may not be for me you can really start to understand oh this isn't that hard you know I can do this you know and get that confident that you need and that way you can start jumping in and getting a little bit more information there's a wealth of information out there but as you've seen from these ladies and myself we have communities that are waiting to assist you in your journey so tap into it can you asked a question again I forgot no worries just could you give a one final piece of advice to anyone who's looking to get started or any resources that were really helpful to you in this space oh yeah um how to get started how to get started um research on your own because a lot of these institutions don't really like academic institutions They Don't Really teach crypto and if they do you have to have like your prerequisite for comp sign and some people who don't even study compsite who want to learn more about blockchain if you are like on campus and everything like that see if there's a blockchain club in your school and if there's not start be the Pioneer start it even if you're still learning start it because you're going to attract so many people that's going to support you and then you can join the blockchain education Network and get you guys's uh your your expenses paid when you go to conferences um and then in terms of resources YouTube University that's how I learned my city smart contracts that's how I learned like YouTube University I'm telling you it's so it's so rich the information there and then also just going like step by step of why smart contracts exist x y z all you need that context I actually like understand that you know as as you're building you as a builder have value I think we've kind of lost that sometimes in business it's like sometimes developers aren't even seen as like the the gods that we are like you know what I mean like it's always a Biz Dev people and the people who bring in the money but at the end of the day if you don't have the developers if you're not if you don't have the coders what's being built what's the product so uh YouTube University for sure and um and then also just like just reach out and find your community I feel I feel like it's like that's a very interesting thing to say but like once you have your community you have like that one set of crypto friends you're bouncing from conference to conference with before you know it you're going to be like relatively renowned and known in this space and and also you know mingle with people so that's my that's my tidbit I'll go um so you may have heard of the term white papers um so when you're getting into this space and you're looking at blockchains and you're looking at tokens they're gonna be there's some mini names white green they've kind of iterated the biz Dev people took over what used to be very technical papers that explain the mechanism behind the blockchain and why it worked and how it was validating transaction kind of got has gotten watered down in the process so just the tip you know as you're evaluating projects you may want to invest in or projects you want to invest in I.E communities you want to join right because that's a huge component the reason why nft projects are accessible or the reason why people believe in a certain cryptocurrency is because of the community that's behind it um check the credentials check the Carfax you don't have to understand everything but it should read technical right I think about the people who are doing like Progressive work in nfts smart contracts um the developers I know they take it very seriously right what type of tokenomics mechanisms they're implementing and they make it clear like for their Community how they're doing it it's not just a bunch of marketing tool you're not just going to hear like oh um shark like there's some key words um I think there's another one um yeah that just people it's like a lot of fluff right a little staking more money yeah a lot of Shilling a lot of fluff so just I guess what I'm saying is get your third eye open this space there is not a lot of safety nets right um and we're dealing with finances we're dealing with data we're dealing with your assets uh so make sure that you are very clear on your kind of intuition get get into like does this feel right does this community seem like they have real resources is this you know a technical piece of work that um has a strong Foundation um and that I think will serve you well as you're navigating the space yeah I like to say crypto question everything like just questioned everything everyone is a suspect to me until prove it innocent especially online because a lot of people are synonymous so just question everything and go go into it with a curious sense and a curious lens and you'll succeed amazing thank you so much um this was really insightful and I know that our participants have so much information and resources that they can take with them after this session I we have a couple questions but first I wanted just to ask you all if you could drop any of the books or the resources that you shared during this session into the chat so that our students have them and then we have uh time for two questions before we move on to our closing um so first could you tell us what surprised you most about web3 or blockchain as you are entering the space and this uh question comes from Diana um I think for me as a writer what surprised me is that Engineers are creators and they are writers as well so I come at it from kind of a nontechnical angle but I really felt I really feel like storytelling has a huge part of web3 and it's something that is missing because there's a there was a lot of misconceptions about crypto prior to women get involved in the space because we are a natural Storyteller so that was like really surprising talking to um the devs a lot of the team I'm pretty much the only female on the team only writers so they really lean on me for copyrighting for storytelling for translating their their code into something that's applicable and is a use case so I was really surprised that I could add value in that sense was the question what surprised Us in the space yes um I think what surprised me honestly was like you know I think as a builder in this space or someone who is active in the community I don't think we think about y'all generation and uh gen Z and younger like it blows my mind like even when we talk about metaphors and things like that I just feel like it's a little bit out of touch and not culturally relevant but y'all went through covid trying to navigate school you know ending your senior years trying to navigate your first years of college like behind the screen so you know in terms of folks that we need to be when we talk about inclusion we have such a lack of inclusion in terms of like a younger generation and it's definitely a generational Gap so that's something that shook me and I'm trying to fix I have a 17 year old brother so I've been onboarding him into this space and man y'all pick it up quicker than us we we on board when the tick tockers our local like social media influencer gave them 50 bucks in each this man flipped it overnight into 500 like just doing a little after you know doing a session with him and taking some back of the notes so um I really hope to see like you guys get more active and build your own communities in safe spaces and I look forward to supporting that I would say for me what surprised me is the variance in the spaces like in terms of the groups that there are there could be like people who are just artists it could be people who are devs crypto Bros it's communities for everyone even if you feel like the the industry isn't like that inclusive you're gonna find your Niche you're gonna find your group of people that you rock with I think that's what surprised me and then also how unorthodox crypto is I went to a conference uh not so long ago by storage Institute and it was for uh Founders young Founders in this space young VCS XYZ and it was in Minnesota and when I tell you that was the most unconventional conventional crypto conference I've ever been to I mean we broke out the conference and did yoga in the in the forest just randomly I'm like man I didn't know I needed this I'm all healed up I hear I heard the sound of the didgeridoo my all my skin is popping all this stuff crypto is so beautiful when you find the right people I feel like it's about finding the right people and I think Melissa said it sifting through the madness sifting through the chaos there's some Bad actors in this space you have to do your due diligence and do your own research but the best additive to doing your own research is knowing somebody who actually knows what they're talking about they'll they'll be able to guide you through the chaos The Madness by Dogecoin buy Dogecoin is going to the Moon they'll be able to help you with that because there's a lot of Bad actors in this space whether it's the institutions or individual uh uh individual players you got to watch yourself and always remember you want to accumulate crypto in the sense of like accumulating Bitcoin with a a Bitcoin forward mindset all the other cryptos I mean you got to do your research to figure out what's what what's good for you uh polygon uh ethereum XYZ tezos but Bitcoin you want to accumulate as much Bitcoin as possible because it's only going to be 21 million ever 21 million we gotta we're in a rush so that's my last tipit for you guys for me I would say initially what surprised me was the fact that this wasn't just um allocated to the U.S this is a global uh movement that's happening right now we call it Revolution uh we're shifting people's mind we're Shifting the way that we think and the way that we operate and do things in this space um I would say the same thing continues to surprise me because now we got the government coming in right they're creating their own Central Bank digital currency we have all kinds of industry in this space and soon enough the whole entire world will be operating um some way of fashion through blockchain and um you know I want we want our people to tap into that so it's just the quickness of how things move you know um we we say we're still we're still new we're still young things are still you know in the early stages and it really is still in the early stages but just by tapping in and being involved you're realizing that they've moved in warp speed um and the things that you thought you knew is now different things are changing now we have what is it so bound nfts which basically companies are looking at creating a selfidentity a selfsovereignty identity ID such as a driver's license you may have your driver's license as an nft and so bound nft just means you can't transfer it to anyone so it stays with you forever so things like that continues to surprise me in this space thank you for all your insights so I'm gonna ask the best way for our participants to stay in touch with you guys and thank you all for attending also before you go here so you can get the last two codes for the session first fill up the survey you can find the link in the section description box below let us know what you want to see more of and watch the roll call that will come up on the screen when the session ends for the last code also make sure you follow black girls code on the socials and join the alumni mailing list and stay up to date with events and more scholarships and internships we'll have covered development scholarships sponsor alumni trips at afrotech this November um for our panelists feel free to drop it in the chat as well but thank you everyone for coming I truly enjoyed all your Insight and I learned even more about my web3 and I'm very excited to get started yeah and stick around for session three um where you can learn even more and hear from even more incredible speakers peace thank you so much thank you ladies see you on in the metaverse thank you all thank you this was fantastic
