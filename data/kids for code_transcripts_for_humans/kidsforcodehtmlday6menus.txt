00:01 - hi guys welcome back to our final html
00:05 - lesson
00:06 - so today we're going to be learning
00:08 - about making menus
00:09 - or navigation bars for our website
00:14 - we're going to start off with the basics
00:15 - which is just html
00:18 - and just like in a restaurant
00:21 - uh for a restaurant menu our navigation
00:25 - bar on our website is basically just
00:27 - going to be
00:27 - a list of items more specifically
00:30 - the items are going to be links to other
00:33 - pages that we create
00:35 - so the user can navigate to different
00:37 - pages
00:38 - and so to start off our html
00:42 - we're going to be making an unordered
00:44 - list of
00:45 - links so i'm going to demo
00:49 - we're going to create an unordered list
00:53 - and inside for our list items
00:57 - we're going to be putting links and you
01:00 - guys have done this already so this
01:02 - should be
01:02 - a piece of cake and i'm just going to
01:05 - put
01:05 - three websites that i have already made
01:23 - and the last one
01:34 - okay so i have my three
01:37 - links or list items in my unordered list
01:40 - and if i were to live preview this
01:47 - we can see that we just have a simple
01:50 - unordered list
01:51 - with bullets and some formatting to let
01:55 - us know that these are links
01:57 - now for our navigation bar we don't want
02:00 - bullets and we don't want the formatting
02:03 - so next we're going to use css to get
02:06 - rid of some of these
02:08 - formatting so for the css
02:15 - we're going to start learning how to
02:17 - create a vertical navigation bar
02:20 - and as you can see like we have demoed
02:25 - the list is bulleted and formatted and
02:28 - in order to get rid of these we need to
02:30 - use
02:30 - css so
02:34 - the three properties that we're going to
02:36 - be using
02:37 - are list style type margin
02:40 - and padding and our selector is going to
02:44 - be
02:44 - ul or our unordered list because that is
02:48 - where
02:48 - most of the formatting takes place
02:51 - so inside our style tags we're going to
02:54 - use the selector ul
02:57 - and the list style type property
03:01 - is going to be used to get rid of the
03:04 - bullets
03:07 - in the browser for links there is some
03:10 - default formatting
03:11 - which kind of pulls the list away from
03:14 - the side of the page
03:16 - and closer to the center so for our
03:19 - navigation bar we want it to be
03:21 - exactly on the side of our page so we're
03:24 - going to get rid of that by setting
03:25 - the margin and the padding to zero
03:34 - now we can see that the bullets are gone
03:37 - and the list
03:38 - is exactly on the side of our page which
03:41 - is where we want it
03:45 - so next you can see that for links
03:47 - there's some
03:48 - text decoration which is the underline
03:51 - and you guys have learned the text
03:53 - decoration property
03:55 - in order to get rid of these underlines
03:58 - we're going to be
03:59 - setting the text decoration property to
04:02 - none so
04:06 - our selector for this is going to be
04:09 - list
04:09 - item link because uh we have a list
04:13 - of links and we want to specify that
04:17 - it is the list or the links in our list
04:22 - that we want to format
04:23 - and not the other links on our page
04:27 - so we're going to set text decoration to
04:31 - none
04:34 - and now we can see that the underlines
04:36 - are gone
04:38 - and next we're going to be talking about
04:41 - something called
04:45 - display or block display
04:49 - as you can see if i hover my mouse over
04:52 - the words
04:53 - i'm able to click on the link
04:56 - but if i were to move my mouse outside
04:59 - of the words in this blank space right
05:02 - here
05:02 - i can't click it and navigate to a
05:04 - different page
05:06 - and for our navigation bars
05:09 - we want it to be
05:12 - we want it to be easy to use so that the
05:15 - user can click
05:16 - a large area around the word and still
05:19 - be able to navigate to a different page
05:22 - so for this we're going to use a
05:23 - property called display
05:26 - and we're going to set it to block
05:29 - and in order for you guys to visualize
05:31 - visualize this
05:33 - i'm going to set the background color
05:36 - to let's say this color
05:41 - now if i were to run it you can see that
05:44 - the space
05:45 - outside of the words is also
05:48 - in color and if i were to click outside
05:50 - of the words in this space
05:53 - it actually takes me to the page which
05:55 - means the link is active
05:57 - all along this colored area
06:00 - and if i were to set my screen to the
06:04 - biggest you can see that it extends all
06:06 - the way across the page
06:08 - now for our navigation menus we don't
06:11 - need it to be
06:12 - all the way across the page so
06:15 - we're going to set the width to a width
06:17 - that we would like
06:19 - and i'm just going to set my width to
06:21 - about 100 pixels
06:24 - and you can make yours whatever you
06:26 - would like
06:27 - so if we were to run this you can see
06:29 - that the length has decreased
06:31 - significantly
06:32 - and it's just this area that is
06:35 - clickable
06:38 - so i can click outside of the words and
06:40 - the links
06:41 - still work
06:47 - um so that is about it
06:50 - for making a vertical navigation bar
06:54 - and we also have horizontal navigation
06:57 - bars
06:59 - which is similar to the navigation bar
07:03 - you see
07:03 - up here on the screen
07:06 - where my mouse is
07:10 - so to create a horizontal navigation bar
07:13 - first we're going to be talking about
07:15 - the display property again
07:18 - and keep in mind that using the display
07:21 - property
07:22 - to create a horizontal navigation bar
07:25 - only works
07:26 - if you have not formatted your menu yet
07:31 - and what i mean by that is this is a
07:34 - formatted
07:34 - navigation bar and if i were to use
07:38 - the display property and set the value
07:41 - to inline
07:42 - this will have no effect on what the
07:44 - menu looks like
07:47 - so as you can see
07:52 - if i were to use the selector list item
07:56 - and set the display to inline
08:02 - our menu remains vertical now if i were
08:05 - to get rid
08:06 - of this formatting that i have here
08:14 - we can see that the links have moved
08:17 - side by side
08:19 - and now this is basically a horizontal
08:22 - navigation bar
08:24 - but if you wanted to keep your
08:25 - formatting and keep
08:27 - your um block display
08:31 - you can use a different property which
08:34 - is called
08:35 - float and we're going to set this float
08:37 - property
08:38 - to left which will get our block
08:41 - elements to be
08:42 - next to each other
08:46 - so if i i have replaced my formatting
08:49 - and now i'm just going to replace the
08:53 - display in line line to
08:56 - float and set it to left
09:00 - and now if i were to run it we can see
09:02 - that
09:03 - our links are formatted and
09:06 - uh in a horizontal line next to each
09:09 - other
09:10 - now you can also set float to
09:13 - right and what this will do
09:16 - is just going to move all the links to
09:19 - the right side of your page
09:20 - if you wanted your navigation bar to be
09:23 - on the right side instead of the left
09:26 - so that is it
09:30 - for navigation bars and
09:33 - i hope you guys get a lot of practice
09:35 - doing this it's really fun once you get
09:37 - used to it
09:39 - and since this is our last lesson
09:43 - um we'll be saying goodbye and i hope
09:46 - you guys
09:47 - keep coding and i hope you guys have had
09:51 - a fun time with us
09:52 - learning about html bye

Cleaned transcript:

hi guys welcome back to our final html lesson so today we're going to be learning about making menus or navigation bars for our website we're going to start off with the basics which is just html and just like in a restaurant uh for a restaurant menu our navigation bar on our website is basically just going to be a list of items more specifically the items are going to be links to other pages that we create so the user can navigate to different pages and so to start off our html we're going to be making an unordered list of links so i'm going to demo we're going to create an unordered list and inside for our list items we're going to be putting links and you guys have done this already so this should be a piece of cake and i'm just going to put three websites that i have already made and the last one okay so i have my three links or list items in my unordered list and if i were to live preview this we can see that we just have a simple unordered list with bullets and some formatting to let us know that these are links now for our navigation bar we don't want bullets and we don't want the formatting so next we're going to use css to get rid of some of these formatting so for the css we're going to start learning how to create a vertical navigation bar and as you can see like we have demoed the list is bulleted and formatted and in order to get rid of these we need to use css so the three properties that we're going to be using are list style type margin and padding and our selector is going to be ul or our unordered list because that is where most of the formatting takes place so inside our style tags we're going to use the selector ul and the list style type property is going to be used to get rid of the bullets in the browser for links there is some default formatting which kind of pulls the list away from the side of the page and closer to the center so for our navigation bar we want it to be exactly on the side of our page so we're going to get rid of that by setting the margin and the padding to zero now we can see that the bullets are gone and the list is exactly on the side of our page which is where we want it so next you can see that for links there's some text decoration which is the underline and you guys have learned the text decoration property in order to get rid of these underlines we're going to be setting the text decoration property to none so our selector for this is going to be list item link because uh we have a list of links and we want to specify that it is the list or the links in our list that we want to format and not the other links on our page so we're going to set text decoration to none and now we can see that the underlines are gone and next we're going to be talking about something called display or block display as you can see if i hover my mouse over the words i'm able to click on the link but if i were to move my mouse outside of the words in this blank space right here i can't click it and navigate to a different page and for our navigation bars we want it to be we want it to be easy to use so that the user can click a large area around the word and still be able to navigate to a different page so for this we're going to use a property called display and we're going to set it to block and in order for you guys to visualize visualize this i'm going to set the background color to let's say this color now if i were to run it you can see that the space outside of the words is also in color and if i were to click outside of the words in this space it actually takes me to the page which means the link is active all along this colored area and if i were to set my screen to the biggest you can see that it extends all the way across the page now for our navigation menus we don't need it to be all the way across the page so we're going to set the width to a width that we would like and i'm just going to set my width to about 100 pixels and you can make yours whatever you would like so if we were to run this you can see that the length has decreased significantly and it's just this area that is clickable so i can click outside of the words and the links still work um so that is about it for making a vertical navigation bar and we also have horizontal navigation bars which is similar to the navigation bar you see up here on the screen where my mouse is so to create a horizontal navigation bar first we're going to be talking about the display property again and keep in mind that using the display property to create a horizontal navigation bar only works if you have not formatted your menu yet and what i mean by that is this is a formatted navigation bar and if i were to use the display property and set the value to inline this will have no effect on what the menu looks like so as you can see if i were to use the selector list item and set the display to inline our menu remains vertical now if i were to get rid of this formatting that i have here we can see that the links have moved side by side and now this is basically a horizontal navigation bar but if you wanted to keep your formatting and keep your um block display you can use a different property which is called float and we're going to set this float property to left which will get our block elements to be next to each other so if i i have replaced my formatting and now i'm just going to replace the display in line line to float and set it to left and now if i were to run it we can see that our links are formatted and uh in a horizontal line next to each other now you can also set float to right and what this will do is just going to move all the links to the right side of your page if you wanted your navigation bar to be on the right side instead of the left so that is it for navigation bars and i hope you guys get a lot of practice doing this it's really fun once you get used to it and since this is our last lesson um we'll be saying goodbye and i hope you guys keep coding and i hope you guys have had a fun time with us learning about html bye
