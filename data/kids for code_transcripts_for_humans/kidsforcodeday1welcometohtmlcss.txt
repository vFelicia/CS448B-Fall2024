01:16 - through projects that we assign it's a
01:19 - really great resource for now we're
01:21 - going to be focusing on three main
01:23 - coding languages HTML and CSS which are
01:26 - tied together Python and Java before we
01:30 - go any further I just wanted to show you
01:32 - guys our website for kids for code so

02:04 - curriculum since we're just getting
02:07 - started there's only one folder up so
02:09 - far but you can click on this and this
02:12 - is where you can
02:13 - see all the topics and the cool things
02:15 - we're going to be learning about these
02:16 - next few days so feel free to check it
02:18 - out okay so you might be wondering why
02:23 - is knowing how to code so important
02:25 - what's the big deal well you can make
02:28 - almost anything you want anything you
02:31 - dream up with coding I'm going to build
02:32 - a website I'm coding wanna go to space
02:36 - also coding you want to build a robot
02:38 - also coding
02:39 - obviously these are very big expensive
02:42 - projects that you probably don't do very
02:45 - often but so many other things in your
02:47 - daily lives too extremely useful and
02:51 - important skill to have HTML and CSS
02:54 - which are the two languages we're going
02:56 - to be starting with today are one of the
02:58 - most commonly used coding languages and
03:00 - it's actually use like people all over
03:02 - the world to make your own websites by
03:04 - the end of our HTML lessons you guys
03:06 - will be able to do just that make your
03:08 - own website so besides all useful coding
03:11 - is in the real world and how fun it is
03:13 - there are so many other benefits like
03:15 - being able to use and understand your
03:18 - daily technology better like your phones
03:20 - your laptop's your video games things
03:22 - like that it also improves your thinking
03:25 - skills and your problem-solving skills
03:26 - and so much more in just in general
03:29 - computers and Technology are huge part
03:31 - of our world in our lives and our future
03:33 - or whether people like it or not so we
03:36 - strongly believe that everyone should be
03:37 - able to have these basic coding skills
03:39 - including kids because it's never too
03:42 - early to start learning so you heard me
03:45 - talk about these coding languages before
03:47 - but you might not know what they are
03:48 - well just like you use languages like
03:52 - English Spanish Chinese French and more
03:55 - to talk to your friends your family and
03:56 - your teachers everyday and communicate
03:58 - with them you need these coding
04:01 - languages to talk to your computer
04:04 - obviously the computer can't understand
04:06 - English for other children languages so
04:08 - you need these complete coding languages
04:09 - like HTML Python Java and more to
04:12 - communicate with your computer just like
04:14 - you communicate with other people so
04:18 - let's go into a little more detail about
04:20 - a few specific coding languages HTML and
04:24 - CSS so what exactly is a
04:27 - Gmail and CSS well as we mentioned
04:29 - before hTML is used to keep websites on
04:32 - the Internet ESS is just another
04:35 - language that we use to help our HTML
04:36 - websites with much cooler and more
04:38 - interesting so think of HTML as the
04:41 - basic building blocks of your page for
04:44 - the basic plain foundation of a house
04:46 - pretty boring nothing much to see but
04:49 - with CSS we can design and transform
04:52 - this boring house
04:53 - or website into something much more
04:55 - unique and interesting to look at
04:58 - basically we need both CSS and HTML
05:01 - because they go hand-in-hand to help us
05:03 - make really cool websites so to get
05:07 - started there are three main cards we
05:09 - want to begin with this big text in bold
05:13 - is called a header this is a paragraph
05:15 - and this is a type of list
05:17 - it's a bulleted list what you guys call
05:18 - when you aren't familiar with this is a
05:21 - really simple clean website that I
05:23 - created in literally 30 seconds and this
05:26 - is a code that I used to clean it with
05:27 - but don't get over one when you see this
05:29 - at first I know it can look like a lot
05:31 - trust me it's actually very simple and
05:33 - we're gonna go into a lot more detail
05:35 - about this later don't worry but for now
05:37 - just take note of this text in green
05:40 - these are called HTML tags notice how
05:43 - they don't appear in your final web site
05:45 - that's because these tags they telling
05:48 - the computer what to do and they tell it
05:51 - give them instructions on how to display
05:54 - your content in your final website but
05:56 - they don't actually show up and your
05:58 - final product so in order to create your
06:02 - own website you're going to need tools
06:03 - this is where you put all your own your
06:06 - code in for today it's very simple all
06:08 - you need is a text editor it's already
06:10 - installed on your computer so you don't
06:12 - need to download anything if you're
06:14 - using a PC just go to your search bar
06:16 - and type notepad and quick notepad if
06:19 - you're using a Mac let's go to your
06:22 - applications and click TextEdit so my
06:26 - website that I showed you guys earlier
06:27 - is saved as an HTML file because HTML
06:30 - I'm sorry and this is just the structure
06:33 - that it gets saved to your computer so
06:35 - you've got the name on your file and the
06:37 - file extension this file extension just
06:39 - tells the browser what
06:41 - type of file it is in this case it's an
06:43 - HTML file and you don't really need to
06:46 - know all the details about this just
06:48 - know that's how the file gets saved to
06:51 - your computer but just writing the code
06:54 - in a file or a text editor isn't enough
06:56 - because how do you actually see your
06:58 - website well to do this you're going to
07:00 - need a browser I'm going to show you
07:03 - guys what I did after I wrote all my
07:06 - code in notepad I went ahead and saved
07:09 - it to my computer and then I went and
07:12 - found the file location on my computer
07:15 - where it was saved on my computer and
07:17 - click open win you can choose any web
07:20 - browser you want
07:20 - I chose Chrome and you've got your
07:23 - website how cool is that really simple
07:25 - and easy and obviously that's a very
07:29 - simple example kind of boring but in
07:31 - about a week you guys are going to be
07:33 - able to make much better and complex
07:35 - websites with up there getting started
07:38 - with tags and elements we're not going
07:40 - to go into too much detail about this
07:41 - today today is more of a basic
07:43 - introduction to get you guys familiar
07:45 - with HTML and what it is that all you
07:47 - need to know for now is that HTML uses
07:50 - these things called tags which are these
07:52 - angled brackets you can find these on
07:55 - your keyboard over here so as I
07:58 - mentioned before these tags act as
08:00 - directions for the computer they tell
08:01 - the computer how to display your content
08:04 - in your final website they don't
08:07 - actually show up themselves and the
08:08 - weapon that product so for example this
08:12 - HR tag this tells the browser to display
08:15 - a horizontal line and the words or
08:17 - letters inside between these angled
08:19 - brackets these tags are called elements
08:21 - and most of the tags that we're going to
08:24 - be working with come in pairs this means
08:26 - they have an opening tag and a closing
08:28 - tag the only difference between a
08:30 - closing tag an opening tag is that the
08:32 - closing has a slash in front of it but
08:34 - everything else is the exact same the
08:37 - element or the words and letters inside
08:39 - of these times are the exact same this
08:41 - just tells the computer that they're
08:43 - parrots they're part of the same pair
08:47 - another important thing to know for
08:48 - today is that while hTML is mostly Jason
08:51 - Stiles insensitive which means you can
08:54 - use uppercase lowercase or any
08:56 - combination of uppercase or lowercase
08:58 - that you want and it wouldn't really
09:00 - accept your website it's best to keep it
09:02 - consistent and use moose we use
09:04 - everything in lowercase which is what
09:06 - we're going to be doing so summary time
09:09 - this is just the part of the video where
09:11 - we rocket will we learn today and do a
09:13 - little bit of review and just a reminder
09:15 - I wanted to remind you guys that you can
09:19 - go to our website to sign up for our
09:21 - free zoom lessons to get extra pockets
09:23 - extra help and get more information
09:25 - about us so we come up with these three
09:28 - these four main coding my sorry three
09:31 - main questions for today's video
09:34 - what are coding languages what are HTML
09:37 - and CSS what is HTML News 4 and what is
09:40 - CSS used for and what do tags do so take
09:44 - the time to think about the answers to
09:46 - these before the next video and next
09:48 - time we'll start off by reviewing
09:49 - today's talk bags and these questions
09:51 - and if you're having trouble with these
09:53 - questions feel free to rewind and
09:55 - re-watch this video because all the
09:57 - answers are in this video and in the
09:59 - next video we're going to go into actual
10:01 - in-depth coding so that's not something
10:04 - you want to miss be sure to stay tuned
10:05 - ok thank you guys so much for watching
10:08 - and we hope to see you next time
