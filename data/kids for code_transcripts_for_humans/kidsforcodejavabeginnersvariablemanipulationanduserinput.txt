00:00 - hey guys welcome back to kids for code
00:03 - my name is calvin and today we will be
00:05 - learning about variable manipulation and
00:07 - user input for java beginners
00:09 - so first we're going to review the
00:10 - summary from the previous lesson number
00:12 - one what is an integer
00:13 - an integer is any whole number and it
00:15 - can be positive or negative
00:17 - what is camelcase it's how we name
00:19 - variables with more than one word
00:21 - by capitalizing the first letter of any
00:23 - other word besides the first word
00:25 - which the first letter of that word is
00:27 - always lowercase
00:30 - write the line of code to initialize a
00:32 - string variable so we have
00:34 - our data type in this case string our
00:36 - variable name in this case
00:37 - code and our data value in this case
00:40 - kids for code
00:42 - how do you print quotation marks use
00:44 - black slash quotation mark
00:46 - variable manipulation with math
00:48 - operators manipulating means changing
00:50 - our variables
00:50 - variables are always changing so we take
00:53 - our statement in
00:54 - age equals 10 but we want to alter it
00:56 - because today is our birthday
00:58 - how do we be able to do this
01:01 - so we take our statement and add another
01:03 - statement to it
01:05 - age equals age plus one so it takes the
01:07 - existing
01:08 - value of age in this case 10 and adds 1
01:11 - to it making it 11.
01:13 - in age now equals 11.
01:16 - you can use other mathematical operators
01:19 - other than addition such as subtraction
01:21 - multiplication division and modulus
01:23 - there are also additional shortcuts you
01:25 - can use to make your coding easier
01:30 - operations with integers and doubles so
01:32 - we have our statement in age equals 10.
01:35 - let's say we want to add a half year to
01:37 - our age
01:38 - double half year equals 0.5 and so
01:42 - we have a print statement where we add
01:43 - age and half year together
01:46 - and the result is 10.5 which is a double
01:49 - even though we add an
01:49 - integer and a double whenever you do
01:52 - mathematical operations with doubles
01:54 - and integers the result will always be a
01:56 - double
01:58 - and here is another example of this and
02:00 - age equals 10
02:02 - double half equals 0.5 so we want to
02:04 - figure out half
02:05 - of our age so we have age times half
02:09 - this will point 5.0
02:12 - which is a double even though we
02:13 - multiply an integer and a double
02:16 - 5.9 is a whole number but is a double
02:18 - because of the point zero
02:22 - dividing integers integers only hold
02:23 - whole numbers what happens if you divide
02:25 - a variable that holds five by another
02:27 - that holds two
02:28 - so we have int num one equals five and
02:30 - it num two
02:32 - equals two so we print out the result of
02:35 - this
02:35 - num1 divided by num2 so
02:39 - it's 5 divided by 2. and the result
02:42 - you'd expect the result to be 2.5 right
02:45 - but
02:45 - since num1 and num2 are both integers a
02:48 - whole number will be printed
02:50 - but in java since the number will not be
02:52 - around it will be truncated
02:53 - that means the decimals will just be
02:55 - taken off in our example
02:56 - 2 will be printed because 2.5 with no
02:58 - decimals is 2.
03:02 - modus modulus is a mathematical operator
03:05 - that we often use in programming
03:06 - languages
03:07 - allows us to get the remainder of a
03:08 - division operation
03:11 - let's look at the examples eleven modus
03:13 - three
03:14 - equals two this is because eleven
03:16 - divided by 3 equals 3 with the remainder
03:18 - of 2.
03:19 - so the result of mod 11 modulus 3 is 2
03:22 - which is the remainder
03:23 - of the division problem 5 minus 2 equals
03:27 - 1
03:28 - because 5 divided by 2 equals 2 with a
03:30 - remainder of 1
03:32 - so that remainder is the answer for 5
03:34 - modulus 2.
03:36 - and what if you divide something and
03:38 - there is no remainder
03:40 - like this one 12 divided by 3 equals 4
03:43 - with
03:43 - and there's no remainder 12 modulus 3
03:45 - will equal 0
03:46 - because there is no remainder
03:51 - so guys i will show you an example
03:54 - of mathematical operations in eclipse so
03:58 - let's create an integer
03:59 - and num1 equals 12
04:03 - and a double
04:10 - num2 equals 2.5
04:17 - let's multiply these two together in a
04:19 - print statement system
04:20 - dot out dot print
04:26 - line
04:28 - num1 times num2
04:33 - let's check out the result
04:37 - and there are some errors and this is
04:39 - because i used a colon
04:41 - instead of a semicolon and that is
04:44 - something that you should
04:45 - make sure you fix every time you run
04:48 - your code to make sure that you're using
04:50 - semicolons instead of cooling so i'm
04:53 - going to run it again
04:54 - this time with the semicolon
05:00 - so the result is a double the double is
05:03 - a whole number
05:04 - but it still is a double and this is
05:05 - because we're multiplying a double
05:07 - by an integer let's say we want to
05:09 - update num1
05:10 - and change the value we could use a
05:12 - statement num1
05:15 - equals num1
05:18 - plus 10.
05:23 - and then let's print out the value
05:27 - of num1 to see what how it got changed
05:36 - let's see what happens
05:41 - so the first line is the result of our
05:44 - previous calculation but the second line
05:46 - result of updating num1 as you can see
05:49 - it's 22 because we're taking the
05:51 - existing value of num1 which is 12
05:53 - and adding 10 to it making it 22. from
05:56 - now on if we were
05:57 - to use num1 again the value of it would
06:00 - be
06:01 - 22 and not 10 and not 12.
06:11 - hey guys now we will talk about user
06:13 - input
06:14 - to get information from the user you
06:16 - will get information
06:18 - from them from the keyboard to do this
06:21 - we use the scanner class
06:22 - you don't have to worry about exactly
06:24 - what this means but you do have to know
06:26 - a few things about it
06:28 - so you want to have the line import
06:31 - java.util.astex semicolon
06:34 - before your public class this means it's
06:36 - at the
06:37 - very top of your program and you also
06:40 - want to have
06:41 - the line of code scanner keyboard equals
06:42 - new scanner system not in
06:44 - before you ask for user input
06:49 - and then this line of code will allow
06:51 - you to take user input
06:52 - and use it as a data valuable for a
06:55 - variable
06:56 - so data equals keyboard dot next line
07:00 - is what you use for strings and data
07:03 - equals keyboard.next in is what you use
07:04 - for integers
07:11 - step one is our import scanner
07:16 - statement number one it's import
07:20 - java.util.asterisk semicolon
07:22 - this statement tells eclipse that you
07:24 - will be using the scanner found in the
07:26 - util package
07:27 - you want to put this import statement
07:30 - above where you made a new class
07:34 - and you must have this import statement
07:36 - in order to get user input
07:40 - the next step is to create the keyboard
07:42 - scanner
07:44 - and its scanner keyboard equals new
07:45 - scanner system.in
07:47 - and you need to scan before you can read
07:49 - or scan
07:50 - what the user types on your keyboard and
07:53 - you may notice that this is similar to
07:55 - how we create other variables like
07:56 - strings since scanner is a data type
08:00 - keyboard is the name of a variable and
08:02 - the rest is what the variable will equal
08:04 - as you can notice you could see the
08:06 - similarities between
08:07 - string name equals john and skinner
08:09 - keyboard equals new scanner system dot
08:11 - in
08:13 - although scanner keyboard is a little
08:15 - bit more complicated
08:17 - step three asking the user for input
08:20 - after creating the scanner
08:23 - statement you can now you can read what
08:24 - the user types
08:27 - this line of code will help the user
08:28 - type in information
08:30 - this line of code is first name equals
08:32 - keyboard.nextline
08:34 - you may notice that there's a print
08:35 - statement at the top but this print
08:36 - statement
08:37 - serves to let the user know that they
08:40 - need to type something in
08:43 - and just in case you forgot you use next
08:45 - line for words and phrases or strings
08:48 - and use nexus for numbers aka integers
08:52 - notice that we usually have a print
08:53 - statement and then ask for input
08:55 - this is to make sure that we are telling
08:56 - the user what we want them to input
08:58 - otherwise they won't know to type
09:00 - something and the rest of your code
09:01 - won't run
09:02 - until they enter something
09:09 - so i will now show you a demo
09:14 - hey guys now i'm showing a demo
09:17 - and eclipse on user input so we start
09:20 - with our import statement
09:21 - import java dot
09:24 - util dot asterisk
09:28 - semicolon now this statement will allow
09:32 - us to use
09:33 - the util package
09:36 - then we need another statement to
09:38 - initialize the variable
09:39 - scanner
09:42 - scanner keyboard equals
09:46 - new scanner
09:51 - system dot in
09:55 - it's important to make sure that system
09:57 - dot in is in parentheses
10:01 - now that we have both of these
10:02 - statements we're ready to get the user's
10:04 - input
10:05 - so let me make a variable that i want to
10:08 - equal
10:09 - the user input so i'm going to call it
10:12 - i'm going to make it a string and i'm
10:13 - going to call it
10:15 - first name
10:21 - i don't have to initialize it yet so i
10:23 - just add a semicolon
10:27 - then i'm going to make a print statement
10:31 - to let the user know that i want them to
10:33 - give user input
10:46 - then below that i
10:50 - make my variable first name
10:54 - equal to keyboard
11:00 - dot next line
11:04 - notice that i need parentheses after the
11:06 - next line part
11:11 - let's see if we got their user input
11:13 - correctly we're going to respond back
11:15 - to the user's input with a greeting
11:26 - so we're going to have some words in
11:29 - quotation marks
11:30 - and we're going to add our variable
11:32 - first name
11:37 - and let's see what the result is
11:43 - and again as you can see there's a
11:46 - problem
11:46 - when you use colon so make sure that you
11:48 - use semicolons
11:49 - instead
11:55 - so it prompts me to enter my first name
11:58 - so i will enter it
12:00 - calvin press enter and then says hi
12:03 - calvin back
12:08 - and this has been the user input demo
12:13 - now you can answer these questions based
12:15 - on what you have learned in this lesson
12:19 - so question one how can you add one to
12:21 - the value of an integer variable
12:24 - question two what happens if you divide
12:26 - two integers
12:28 - three what line of code will let the
12:29 - user enter in a word
12:31 - slash phrase four what line of code will
12:34 - let the user
12:35 - enter in a number and five what is
12:38 - non-modulus for if you're confused
12:42 - with any of these questions feel free to
12:44 - watch the video again
12:45 - to help strengthen your understanding of
12:48 - these concepts
12:50 - bye guys

Cleaned transcript:

hey guys welcome back to kids for code my name is calvin and today we will be learning about variable manipulation and user input for java beginners so first we're going to review the summary from the previous lesson number one what is an integer an integer is any whole number and it can be positive or negative what is camelcase it's how we name variables with more than one word by capitalizing the first letter of any other word besides the first word which the first letter of that word is always lowercase write the line of code to initialize a string variable so we have our data type in this case string our variable name in this case code and our data value in this case kids for code how do you print quotation marks use black slash quotation mark variable manipulation with math operators manipulating means changing our variables variables are always changing so we take our statement in age equals 10 but we want to alter it because today is our birthday how do we be able to do this so we take our statement and add another statement to it age equals age plus one so it takes the existing value of age in this case 10 and adds 1 to it making it 11. in age now equals 11. you can use other mathematical operators other than addition such as subtraction multiplication division and modulus there are also additional shortcuts you can use to make your coding easier operations with integers and doubles so we have our statement in age equals 10. let's say we want to add a half year to our age double half year equals 0.5 and so we have a print statement where we add age and half year together and the result is 10.5 which is a double even though we add an integer and a double whenever you do mathematical operations with doubles and integers the result will always be a double and here is another example of this and age equals 10 double half equals 0.5 so we want to figure out half of our age so we have age times half this will point 5.0 which is a double even though we multiply an integer and a double 5.9 is a whole number but is a double because of the point zero dividing integers integers only hold whole numbers what happens if you divide a variable that holds five by another that holds two so we have int num one equals five and it num two equals two so we print out the result of this num1 divided by num2 so it's 5 divided by 2. and the result you'd expect the result to be 2.5 right but since num1 and num2 are both integers a whole number will be printed but in java since the number will not be around it will be truncated that means the decimals will just be taken off in our example 2 will be printed because 2.5 with no decimals is 2. modus modulus is a mathematical operator that we often use in programming languages allows us to get the remainder of a division operation let's look at the examples eleven modus three equals two this is because eleven divided by 3 equals 3 with the remainder of 2. so the result of mod 11 modulus 3 is 2 which is the remainder of the division problem 5 minus 2 equals 1 because 5 divided by 2 equals 2 with a remainder of 1 so that remainder is the answer for 5 modulus 2. and what if you divide something and there is no remainder like this one 12 divided by 3 equals 4 with and there's no remainder 12 modulus 3 will equal 0 because there is no remainder so guys i will show you an example of mathematical operations in eclipse so let's create an integer and num1 equals 12 and a double num2 equals 2.5 let's multiply these two together in a print statement system dot out dot print line num1 times num2 let's check out the result and there are some errors and this is because i used a colon instead of a semicolon and that is something that you should make sure you fix every time you run your code to make sure that you're using semicolons instead of cooling so i'm going to run it again this time with the semicolon so the result is a double the double is a whole number but it still is a double and this is because we're multiplying a double by an integer let's say we want to update num1 and change the value we could use a statement num1 equals num1 plus 10. and then let's print out the value of num1 to see what how it got changed let's see what happens so the first line is the result of our previous calculation but the second line result of updating num1 as you can see it's 22 because we're taking the existing value of num1 which is 12 and adding 10 to it making it 22. from now on if we were to use num1 again the value of it would be 22 and not 10 and not 12. hey guys now we will talk about user input to get information from the user you will get information from them from the keyboard to do this we use the scanner class you don't have to worry about exactly what this means but you do have to know a few things about it so you want to have the line import java.util.astex semicolon before your public class this means it's at the very top of your program and you also want to have the line of code scanner keyboard equals new scanner system not in before you ask for user input and then this line of code will allow you to take user input and use it as a data valuable for a variable so data equals keyboard dot next line is what you use for strings and data equals keyboard.next in is what you use for integers step one is our import scanner statement number one it's import java.util.asterisk semicolon this statement tells eclipse that you will be using the scanner found in the util package you want to put this import statement above where you made a new class and you must have this import statement in order to get user input the next step is to create the keyboard scanner and its scanner keyboard equals new scanner system.in and you need to scan before you can read or scan what the user types on your keyboard and you may notice that this is similar to how we create other variables like strings since scanner is a data type keyboard is the name of a variable and the rest is what the variable will equal as you can notice you could see the similarities between string name equals john and skinner keyboard equals new scanner system dot in although scanner keyboard is a little bit more complicated step three asking the user for input after creating the scanner statement you can now you can read what the user types this line of code will help the user type in information this line of code is first name equals keyboard.nextline you may notice that there's a print statement at the top but this print statement serves to let the user know that they need to type something in and just in case you forgot you use next line for words and phrases or strings and use nexus for numbers aka integers notice that we usually have a print statement and then ask for input this is to make sure that we are telling the user what we want them to input otherwise they won't know to type something and the rest of your code won't run until they enter something so i will now show you a demo hey guys now i'm showing a demo and eclipse on user input so we start with our import statement import java dot util dot asterisk semicolon now this statement will allow us to use the util package then we need another statement to initialize the variable scanner scanner keyboard equals new scanner system dot in it's important to make sure that system dot in is in parentheses now that we have both of these statements we're ready to get the user's input so let me make a variable that i want to equal the user input so i'm going to call it i'm going to make it a string and i'm going to call it first name i don't have to initialize it yet so i just add a semicolon then i'm going to make a print statement to let the user know that i want them to give user input then below that i make my variable first name equal to keyboard dot next line notice that i need parentheses after the next line part let's see if we got their user input correctly we're going to respond back to the user's input with a greeting so we're going to have some words in quotation marks and we're going to add our variable first name and let's see what the result is and again as you can see there's a problem when you use colon so make sure that you use semicolons instead so it prompts me to enter my first name so i will enter it calvin press enter and then says hi calvin back and this has been the user input demo now you can answer these questions based on what you have learned in this lesson so question one how can you add one to the value of an integer variable question two what happens if you divide two integers three what line of code will let the user enter in a word slash phrase four what line of code will let the user enter in a number and five what is nonmodulus for if you're confused with any of these questions feel free to watch the video again to help strengthen your understanding of these concepts bye guys
