00:02 - hey guys welcome to CSS styling part 2
00:06 - for kids for Cody I'm Danny I'm gonna be
00:10 - demoing everything today so CSS we all
00:17 - learned about things like background
00:19 - colors and font size and how to change
00:23 - the color now we're just gonna win some
00:26 - more CSS rules properties so the first
00:31 - one is text alignment so here right here
00:40 - if you guys I know how to do this you've
00:44 - got left center right and justified so
00:46 - we're gonna learn how to do that in a
00:48 - HTML or a CSS so right here I have my P
00:54 - tag okay
00:55 - and that looks like this okay my webpage
00:59 - here my code here at my web page here so
01:05 - if I want my soccer so cool text to be
01:10 - in the middle I can type text a line and
01:17 - then I put Center okay and if I want it
01:24 - to be you know on the right because
01:28 - right is cool I can do that
01:32 - and of course the default is left
01:35 - justified isn't gonna do anything here
01:39 - because you don't have much text so I'm
01:42 - gonna grab some text real good if some
01:47 - generator where I'm if some is what
01:52 - really cool programmers use when they
01:55 - don't have text and they just want to
01:56 - put a design and they use it as
02:00 - placeholder text so right here is
02:04 - justify okay so what actually happens
02:08 - here is that all the words are spaced
02:11 - out
02:12 - so that it takes up the whole way okay
02:16 - we can see that it's different as left
02:21 - because see how the words aren't aligned
02:25 - straight here yeah so that's a
02:28 - difference justify means it's gonna take
02:30 - up the whole way and newspapers use
02:33 - these articles sometimes do and you can
02:37 - still do right another thing you can
02:40 - also do right justify oh wait make it my
02:46 - mistake yeah but um no I just forgot
02:54 - about that okay and next property we're
02:58 - going to learn without is text
03:01 - decoration so text decoration is one of
03:03 - the properties where you can put um just
03:07 - some or all of them so I can do text
03:11 - decoration and I can put underline and
03:21 - this text becomes underlying I can put
03:25 - over line and there's an over line and I
03:30 - can foot-wide there and there but the
03:37 - cool thing is I can do any combination
03:41 - of them too so I can do over line and
03:43 - underline and I just do a space between
03:47 - them now it's got an overlying hand and
03:49 - I'm going I have no idea when you would
03:52 - never need to use that down but it's
03:54 - really cool I do
03:56 - oh you definitely might need to give you
03:58 - some underline and a line through though
04:01 - that did not work just fine on his face
04:04 - but yeah you can do right here and it
04:12 - has an underline and a line too so you
04:17 - know I hope you get that
04:18 - remember that tag name here affects this
04:23 - tag and
04:24 - it will affect all other ptex okay so I
04:29 - think we're gonna learn about background
04:32 - color which we did learn in the last
04:33 - lesson let me go over it again so I can
04:39 - change the background color you know any
04:49 - element but things like images won't
04:52 - work too well because usually they take
04:54 - up the whole space so there's no room
04:56 - for a background but text is good so
05:00 - let's say I want red there's gonna be
05:02 - that or just red I can it will now have
05:09 - a red background and I can do aquamarine
05:17 - because that's also a very nice color
05:20 - sorry about the beeping that's the the
05:23 - printer um next we have padding so
05:28 - padding and margin they're both a little
05:34 - bit hard to understand but not too hard
05:36 - so the first thing I want and it's
05:40 - always good to demonstrate these with a
05:43 - background color or border because
05:46 - sometimes they act similar and you can't
05:50 - really tell the difference
05:51 - so I I'm just gonna show you something
05:55 - and I hope it's clear if I put padding
06:00 - and I do it's 12 pixels height:12px 4
06:07 - pixels it will make the text the content
06:12 - which is a text go in 12 pixels so right
06:16 - here I don't think there's any padding
06:18 - so it'll push the text up to 12 pixels
06:21 - here and 12 pixels here and yeah that's
06:26 - how it looks like so here's the padding
06:28 - this is 12 pixels from the top of the
06:31 - blue to the text and then from the side
06:33 - of the blue to the text
06:36 - that is 12 pixels okay well here might
06:39 - not be but here death - um I'm gonna do
06:43 - a text align just a 5 so it takes a full
06:47 - width for clarity so here to hear from
06:51 - the end of the text the end of the blue
06:53 - is 12 pixels and I can make this a lot
06:56 - bigger if I wanted to so you know that
07:00 - kind of looks nice you know but I want
07:03 - to show you the difference from margin
07:04 - so I'm gonna show you none no cutting
07:09 - and then if I do me margin of 32 pixels
07:15 - yeah that's the difference so margin
07:19 - creates space around it but not
07:23 - including the background I'm not sure
07:26 - how much sense that makes but you can
07:30 - always just go back and forth to
07:32 - experiment but see how the background is
07:35 - on in this space
07:38 - well padding is with margin it just
07:47 - creates space around it outside of the
07:51 - background but with the padding they
07:53 - create space with the background okay
07:55 - it's kind of hard to understand but
07:57 - let's just try with both and eventually
08:00 - it'll just start making sense so this is
08:04 - what I've so excited about I've been so
08:08 - excited about so : hover
08:18 - okay you put that after any element and
08:22 - it will change the element okay so and
08:30 - there's also things like active and
08:34 - focus which is um they have small
08:39 - technical variations but you really only
08:43 - need to know
08:44 - to be a good web developer CSS styling I
08:49 - guess so
08:51 - let's use something simple background
08:56 - color okay and let's do red so right
09:04 - here
09:05 - CSS understands that all these
09:09 - properties need to be applied to P tags
09:11 - right here and they are but with colon
09:16 - hover okay it mean it says whenever the
09:20 - mouse is over a P tag that specific P
09:24 - tag should have this property okay so
09:28 - it's almost look how it is like the CSS
09:31 - changes for that element when the mouse
09:33 - is over it okay
09:35 - colon hover meets the CSS that's applied
09:38 - to an element when the mouse is over it
09:41 - okay so right here if I save that now it
09:46 - turns red when I go over it and just
09:50 - another thing to be clear of if I do
09:53 - margin there's nothing like if you're
09:59 - right here is in within the margin you
10:02 - know 32 pixels 32 pixels here 32 pixels
10:06 - here that's all the margin okay but if
10:11 - on ant if you hover into it but colon
10:17 - heart does not get applied but if you
10:20 - use padding the colon hunger does get
10:23 - apply I hope that's clear
10:27 - yeah and I believe that's it I'm fine on
10:32 - programming your web sites guys um see
10:37 - you in class

here affects this tag and it will affect all other ptex okay so I think we're gonna learn about background color which we did learn in the last lesson let me go over it again so I can change the background color you know any element but things like images won't work too well because usually they take up the whole space so there's no room for a background but text is good so let's say I want red there's gonna be that or just red I can it will now have a red background and I can do aquamarine because that's also a very nice color sorry about the beeping that's the the printer um next we

margin creates space around it but not including the background I'm not sure how much sense that makes but you can always just go back and forth to experiment but see how the background is on in this space well padding is with margin it just creates space around it outside of the background but with the padding they create space with the background okay it's kind of hard to understand but let's just try with both and eventually it'll just start making sense so this is what I've so excited about I've been so excited about so hover okay you put that after any element and it will change the
