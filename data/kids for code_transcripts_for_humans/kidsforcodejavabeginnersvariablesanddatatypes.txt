00:00 - hey guys welcome back to kids for code
00:02 - my name is Jason and today we'll be
00:04 - going over variables and data types for
00:06 - Java beginners so first a review of
00:09 - summary questions from day two so number
00:13 - one how you write the main method well
00:15 - there's only really one way to do this
00:16 - so there's the answer to how would you
00:20 - print the worst so your console hello
00:22 - how are you so we are using the print
00:25 - line instead of print but print also
00:27 - works just make sure the words that
00:30 - you're printing are surrounded by double
00:32 - quotes single quotes will not work okay
00:36 - and a difference between print and print
00:38 - line well print line basically jumps the
00:41 - next line after you print your words
00:43 - it's like pressing enter on your
00:45 - keyboard
00:45 - it it'll take your cursor down to the
00:47 - next line so whatever you print after so
00:51 - if you call print line and print some
00:54 - words out the next thing that you print
00:57 - will start on the next line whereas in
01:00 - print it does not start in the next line
01:02 - it will just start on the same line
01:03 - after after you after you print okay so
01:08 - the new stuff for today what is a
01:10 - variable a variable holds or stores of
01:13 - values so we use variables to label
01:17 - information to store information so in
01:21 - math for example we can have x equals 3
01:24 - and x can only be 3 it can't be 3 & 4
01:29 - it's just 3 so that's the same with job
01:33 - variables can only have one value and we
01:36 - can have different kinds of variables
01:37 - like with numbers and words and phrases
01:40 - so that's what datatypes are they are
01:44 - different kinds of variables we can
01:46 - create so we can go we can create
01:49 - integers doubles strings boolean's
01:52 - and now there are more data types than
01:54 - just those four but we're only going to
01:57 - be covering those four so integers
02:00 - integers are just simply whole numbers
02:02 - it can either be positive or negative so
02:05 - the following examples of work like 1 2
02:07 - 3 negative 8 0 also works but incorrect
02:11 - 1/2 because that's
02:13 - fraction negative 100.1 that's also
02:18 - that's decimal but the interesting one
02:22 - here is ten point zero now you may think
02:26 - well it's a whole number right but it's
02:29 - got the point zero on the end and
02:30 - integers can only store ten so if you
02:33 - want to store 10.0 you just write it as
02:37 - 10 so now doubles are how we store
02:41 - fractions and decimals so 1/2 would be
02:45 - correct the native three point five
02:46 - correct also you can store zero just
02:48 - like with ends but the thing the
02:51 - interesting thing here is one and eight
02:53 - of two because those are whole numbers
02:55 - so you may think they couldn't be stored
02:58 - doubles you may think you'd have to use
02:59 - an INT but the job java would just see
03:04 - one as 1.0 if you store it in a double
03:07 - so that's why it still works and now a
03:12 - string is a collection or string of
03:15 - letters that makes words or phrases so
03:18 - hello world is a string strings don't
03:21 - necessarily have to have multiple words
03:23 - they can just have one
03:24 - and that'll still work and now boolean's
03:27 - boolean's are simply just true or false
03:30 - they can only be true or false that's it
03:33 - okay so they actually create variables
03:37 - we're gonna actually go into eclipse
03:38 - here in just a sec but the format is
03:42 - datatype so that would be write int
03:44 - double string boolean and then a name so
03:49 - you can basically name it whatever you
03:50 - want however there are a couple of rules
03:53 - you have to follow and then equals the
03:56 - value so remember think of the value
03:58 - being placed inside of your variable
04:00 - your variable is like a label for your
04:03 - value so some naming rules camelcase
04:06 - we'll go over where that is in just a
04:08 - second
04:09 - cannot have spaces so you can't have
04:12 - variable space name you have to have in
04:13 - one one word you can't start with a
04:17 - number or special symbol you however can
04:19 - have these in your variable name they
04:21 - just cannot be able to start and it
04:23 - cannot be a Java keyword you'll know if
04:25 - it's Java keyword
04:27 - if it is highlighted in purple such as
04:30 - double Orient okay so now I'm gonna hop
04:33 - into eclipse so if I wanted to create a
04:36 - variable for H I would do int age equals
04:40 - 42 so here we got the we got the data
04:44 - type and then the name and then the
04:46 - value so now if I wanted to create a
04:49 - double double say price equals four
04:53 - point nine nine and so we got double
04:57 - right that is a type name and then the
05:00 - actual value which is a decimal which is
05:03 - what doubles store now here's an
05:06 - interesting example if I do double it's
05:10 - called fraction equals one-fourth this
05:13 - will actually not store one-fourth it'll
05:15 - store zero and I'm not going to get into
05:18 - that abused a bit too complicated for
05:20 - today
05:20 - but whenever you want to store fractions
05:23 - don't don't write it as a fraction just
05:28 - write the decimal form of the fraction
05:30 - so can set up 1/4 I would write 0.25 and
05:35 - now for a string so we can have string
05:39 - sentence right we can have you just say
05:43 - this is a sentence and now we can also
05:48 - have one word stream so string name
05:50 - equals Bob so that works
05:53 - and finally boolean's we have boolean is
05:58 - cold outside and we would say that's
06:01 - false right now okay so those that is
06:07 - how you declare variables that is how
06:09 - you create variables and oh yeah and
06:13 - camelcase
06:14 - so what I just did here is camel case
06:17 - when you have multiple words that you
06:22 - want to call your variable and you can't
06:25 - have spaces so what programmers do is
06:28 - they write in camel case that is where
06:30 - you make the first word lowercase and
06:34 - then the the rest of the words uppercase
06:37 - so that is that is really all camel
06:40 - cases
06:41 - just first word lowercase all the rest
06:43 - uppercase that's how you write in camel
06:45 - case okay so you up here are some
06:52 - examples that we just went over in
06:53 - Eclipse okay so now primitive versus non
06:57 - primitive so primitives include so far
07:00 - what we learned in double boolean again
07:03 - there are more primitives we're just not
07:04 - going to learn about them and they are
07:07 - basic building blocks for more
07:10 - complicated data types so for example a
07:14 - string is non primitive it is more
07:16 - complicated than int double and boolean
07:19 - which are all simple and that's why
07:21 - they're primitives so string is more
07:25 - complex and it is actually built off of
07:28 - primitives so that is why that is how we
07:32 - distinguish between primitives and non
07:34 - primitive it's that primitives are the
07:37 - building blocks for other more
07:40 - complicated data types okay and now we
07:45 - can get into printing variables so we
07:48 - can print any of these four types of
07:51 - data here with a simple print statement
07:55 - so in order to print the variable put
07:59 - the variable name in the print statement
08:01 - that's it no quotes
08:03 - no single close double quotes none of
08:05 - that just the variable name and this
08:08 - will print the value of the variable
08:12 - it's not going to print the word age if
08:14 - I wanted to print the word age I would I
08:17 - would put quotes around right that that
08:19 - would print age see the word age but I
08:23 - want to print the variable age so I am
08:26 - not gonna book quotes around it I am
08:27 - going to just put the word age the
08:31 - variable name age and it'll spit out 42
08:33 - and that's what we want so you can do
08:37 - that with doubles as well
08:39 - strings boolean it'll either print true
08:41 - or false now one thing have to be
08:45 - careful of is this you have to make sure
08:50 - you initialize your variables so if I
08:52 - make another variable here and I
08:54 - set it equal to something by the way
08:56 - initialize means set it equal to
08:59 - something so if I try to print this it
09:05 - will actually give you an error because
09:06 - I didn't initialize it it'll say and
09:11 - then it'll give me an option so I have
09:13 - to initialize it by giving it a value
09:16 - viens just say okay and then so now that
09:22 - now that error is fine now it'll print
09:24 - out last name which has the value Smith
09:34 - okay so now let's do a summary so number
09:37 - one what is an example of an integer or
09:40 - in Java they're called insight we write
09:42 - int number two what is camelcase
09:45 - number three right the line of code to
09:48 - initialize a string variable so you can
09:53 - choose any words you nationalize it to
09:54 - remember strings can be one or many
09:57 - words and with that thank you for
10:01 - watching and I will see you in the next
10:03 - one bye
