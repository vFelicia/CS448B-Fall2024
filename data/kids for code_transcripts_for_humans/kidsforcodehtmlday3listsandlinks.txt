00:00 - hi guys welcome back to kids for code
00:04 - day 3 my name is Zoe and I'm going to be
00:07 - your teacher for today so today we are
00:09 - going to be learning about how to create
00:11 - lists and links and HTML before we get
00:15 - started we are going to go over the
00:16 - answers to some to the summary questions
00:18 - that I left you off with in the previous
00:20 - video so question number one what is the
00:23 - tag that you must have at the very top
00:25 - of your code and that is going to be
00:28 - your document type so make sure that you
00:31 - have the exclamation part exclamation
00:34 - point right before the word doctype
00:36 - number two what is an empty tag mean an
00:40 - empty tag means that there is no closing
00:42 - tag and that there's only one of that
00:44 - tag this tag does not need to surround
00:46 - any other content
00:48 - so normally tags there's an opening and
00:50 - a closing tag however an empty tag means
00:52 - that there is only one of it and it does
00:55 - not need to surround any sort of content
00:57 - so in the last video we saw examples of
00:59 - this through the BR tag which creates a
01:02 - new line and the HR tag which creates a
01:05 - horizontal line number 3 what is the
01:08 - difference between an h1 and an H 6 tag
01:11 - h1 is the most important and h6 is the
01:14 - least important which means h1 creates a
01:16 - bigger heading than h6 so the text that
01:19 - you surround with h1 tags makes it
01:22 - bigger than text these surrounds with h6
01:24 - tags and in the last example as you saw
01:27 - as we progress from h1 to h2 h3 h4 h5
01:30 - and h6 the text is becomes smaller and
01:35 - smaller and so finally h6 is the
01:37 - smallest so if you ever wanted to create
01:39 - a big announcement then use an h1 tag
01:42 - number four what is a toggle you would
01:44 - use to create a line break and that
01:46 - would be the BR tag now notice with
01:49 - empty tags like this you put a forward
01:52 - slash right here before the closing
01:54 - bracket ok now we are going to learn how
01:58 - to create a skeleton now what is a
02:00 - skeleton a skeleton is all the code that
02:03 - you need whenever you create any sort of
02:05 - new HTML project so this is all the code
02:09 - that you need when you create any sort
02:11 - of HTML project now it's
02:14 - kind of annoying how you have to type
02:15 - all of this in every single time you
02:17 - have to start a new project so creating
02:20 - a skeleton is something that will make
02:21 - your lives a lot easier
02:22 - creating a skeleton just means you copy
02:25 - and paste all of this code or you type
02:27 - all this code into a new file and then
02:29 - you save that so that way whenever you
02:32 - start a new project then you can copy
02:34 - and paste this code into your new
02:37 - project so you don't have to manually
02:39 - type all of this code into your new
02:40 - project every single time so I'm going
02:43 - to demonstrate how you save that so in
02:46 - my brackets file right now I have my
02:49 - skeleton open now I'm not going to type
02:52 - any content into here this is just the
02:54 - code that I wanted to save for future
02:57 - projects so what I'm going to do is file
03:00 - save as I'm calling a skeleton dot HTML
03:07 - make sure you always put HTML at the end
03:10 - of your document and I'm saving it in my
03:12 - kids for code website now it's called
03:14 - skeleton because this code is the bare
03:16 - bones of every HTML project that you
03:18 - will create so it's important they give
03:20 - it someplace safe and you save it
03:30 - okay now we are going to learn how to
03:32 - create lists so first we have an ordered
03:35 - list an ordered list means that there
03:38 - are numbers and by default it starts at
03:40 - number one and ascends an increasing
03:42 - order
03:43 - so these oh L tags surrounds the entire
03:47 - list and inside the Oh L tags you have
03:50 - list items so these are the things that
03:52 - are on your list each list item has to
03:55 - be surrounded with this tag so here we
03:58 - have an example items to buy for college
04:00 - and notice up title of this was created
04:02 - with an h1 tag next we have our opening
04:05 - oh el tag and our closing Oh el tag and
04:08 - now inside we have each of our list
04:11 - items laptop mini-fridge laundry basket
04:14 - and notice how each item has its own set
04:17 - of Li tags
04:22 - next we have an unordered list an
04:24 - unordered list means that there are no
04:27 - numbers the order of the list items
04:29 - doesn't matter and use bullet points so
04:34 - here we have an example of ice cream
04:36 - flavors the title has been created with
04:39 - an h1 tag now we have our opening UL tag
04:43 - and our closing UL tag and now inside we
04:46 - have each of our list items chocolate
04:48 - vanilla and strawberry and the tags that
04:51 - you use for list items doesn't change
04:53 - regardless of whether you're using an
04:55 - unordered list or an ordered list so
04:58 - each of our list items is surrounded
05:00 - with an opening and closing Li tag and
05:05 - the order that you type in type it in in
05:08 - the code is the same order that it will
05:10 - appear in your browser and by default
05:13 - the bullet points are going to be small
05:15 - small black circles called disks
05:20 - so the cool thing you can do with
05:23 - ordered lists with all types of Lists
05:26 - actually is nesting and nesting is when
05:29 - you put one list inside of another list
05:32 - so here we're back with our ice cream
05:34 - flavors we have our unordered list
05:36 - chocolate vanilla strawberry however
05:39 - inside our chocolate list item we
05:42 - created a new list
05:45 - and in our new list we have dark milk
05:50 - dark milk
05:53 - so with nesting you can get a lot more
05:56 - specific with each of your list items we
05:59 - have more specific chocolate flavors
06:02 - right here so we have an unordered list
06:06 - right here nested inside this list item
06:11 - of chocolate now notice how the opening
06:14 - tag of chocolate is right here right
06:15 - before they type the word chocolate and
06:17 - the closing tag is right here after the
06:21 - closing tag of the unordered list that
06:23 - is nested inside now we have another
06:27 - example this time with an ordered list
06:29 - so here we have a to-do list we have our
06:33 - opening closing tags and we have two
06:36 - items do laundry and walk the dog
06:38 - however inside do laundry we have a
06:42 - listed a nested list and we have more
06:46 - specific instructions on how to do the
06:49 - laundry
06:49 - so first carry the baskets basement to
06:52 - sort dark and light colors and three
06:54 - check settings on machine so we have
06:57 - this ordered list that gives more
06:59 - specific instructions on how to do the
07:02 - laundry
07:04 - now we are going to learn how to create
07:06 - links so first we're going to learn how
07:10 - to create links to other websites so
07:13 - this is the full tag on how you do it
07:16 - so this is how you do it first you
07:19 - create an opening bracket lowercase a
07:21 - space href equals open quote and this is
07:26 - where you paste the full URL of the
07:29 - website you would like to link close
07:31 - quote
07:32 - close this bracket and then here this
07:36 - word or you can have more than one word
07:39 - is where this link is going to be stored
07:43 - in so on the website the word Google is
07:46 - going to show up and if you click on the
07:49 - word Google it'll take you to this
07:51 - website google.com so in this way you
07:54 - can see that this link is stored inside
07:57 - whatever word is in here so I'm going to
08:00 - demonstrate by giving you another
08:02 - example so what I'm going to do is I'm
08:05 - starting a new HTML project right and as
08:08 - we said before I'm going to copy and
08:10 - paste all of the skeleton code copy new
08:17 - project
08:20 - and paste and always remember to save
08:24 - save as and I'm going to title this link
08:29 - example and don't forget dot HTML and
08:33 - we're going to save it in my documents
08:37 - kids for code folder save okay now I
08:43 - have the basic bare bones of what my
08:46 - project is going to look like now I want
08:49 - a website that I want to link so I'm
08:52 - going to go to the kids for code website
08:54 - and I'm going to copy their link now I'm
09:02 - going back to my code and notice that
09:04 - I'm going to be typing in between the
09:06 - two body tags that's where all of your
09:07 - content goes alright now let's type in
09:10 - the tag a space href equals now a nice
09:17 - thing that brackets does is that when
09:19 - you type in a quotation mark it
09:21 - automatically gives you a closing one so
09:23 - that you won't forget it alright now
09:25 - here is where I will paste my link
09:30 - alright that's the kids for code website
09:32 - link and make sure you close that and
09:34 - now here is where I need to give a few
09:37 - words or one word on that I wanted to
09:41 - store this link in so since this is the
09:43 - kids for code website I think I'm going
09:45 - to put kids for code all right now
09:50 - always remember to save or you can do
09:54 - ctrl s ok now let's live preview and see
09:57 - what this looks like
10:02 - all right here we have kids for code I
10:04 - click on it and it takes me to the kids
10:08 - for code website now let's say I just
10:12 - delete this text and don't forget to
10:16 - save let's go back see now there's
10:22 - nothing here on my web page so even
10:25 - though that the link appears here in
10:27 - your code if there is no word right here
10:30 - to store the Lincoln then the link is
10:32 - not going to appear anywhere on your web
10:34 - page so although you can literally type
10:38 - any word let's say I type in the word
10:39 - unicorn save that
10:47 - see we have the word unicorn and I click
10:49 - on it and it takes me to the same
10:51 - website however unicorn doesn't really
10:56 - have anything to do with kids for code
10:57 - if you want to put anywhere here you
10:59 - want to make it a word that is relevant
11:01 - to the website that you're linking so I
11:03 - think kids for code is the best few
11:08 - words to describe what this link is so
11:12 - let's save that and let's go back click
11:17 - on it and it takes us to kids for code
11:20 - so that is how you create a link to
11:23 - another website now let's go to lick
11:27 - let's learn about how to create links to
11:29 - pages that you have already created so
11:32 - here we have three different files index
11:34 - about and dogs and this is the code for
11:37 - each of them and this is what index will
11:41 - look like in the web browser now
11:43 - something important about this is that
11:45 - if you want to create links like this
11:47 - all of these files have to be saved in
11:51 - the same folder so in this case about
11:54 - dogs index are saved in the same folder
11:57 - called dogs so I'm going to demonstrate
12:02 - let's go to my folder and here's my
12:09 - dog's folder and here are my three files
12:11 - so let's open them in brackets click on
12:16 - it right click open with brackets click
12:20 - on the file right click open with
12:23 - brackets ok so I'm going to live preview
12:26 - what each of these websites look like so
12:30 - this is the about me page let's see what
12:33 - that looks like
12:36 - you
12:39 - all right so about me it's right here
12:43 - and these are the two links to the other
12:46 - two pages this is just some filler text
12:49 - it doesn't really mean anything
12:50 - okay now let's live preview what dogs
12:53 - look like looks like dogs same thing
12:58 - only difference is that dogs is here and
13:01 - we have about an index whenever you're
13:04 - creating a website with multiple pages
13:06 - index just means the home page okay
13:09 - finally let's go to our index home page
13:13 - it's the same thing except it says
13:15 - welcome so the syntax is pretty much the
13:19 - same thing as linking another website
13:22 - however inside the two quotation marks
13:26 - you don't put oh you've website URL you
13:28 - put the name of the file so here we are
13:32 - in the about page right yeah okay so we
13:37 - have two links here the first link and
13:39 - the second link and notice how they're
13:41 - also inside a list an unordered list so
13:46 - we have a first link in our second link
13:48 - and in the two in the quotation marks we
13:51 - have the file name so this is the file
13:54 - name for index this is the file name for
13:57 - dogs so if we go to the website and we
14:00 - click on it index we're on the index
14:03 - page and if we click on my dogs we're on
14:07 - the docs page so let's go to the dogs
14:12 - page we have our two links here this
14:16 - will take us this should take us to the
14:19 - about page and this link should take us
14:22 - to the index page let's see if it works
14:24 - about page
14:26 - yes index page yes so as you can see the
14:33 - syntax is pretty much the same except
14:35 - instead of a website URL here you put
14:38 - the exact file name make sure you spell
14:40 - it correctly because syntax is very
14:42 - important
14:44 - you
14:49 - all right now we are we have some
14:52 - summary questions so the answers to
14:54 - these summary questions can all be found
14:56 - throughout the video so if you rewind
14:58 - and watch carefully and listen carefully
15:00 - then you'll be able to answer all of
15:01 - these questions so number one what is
15:04 - the difference between Al and ul tags
15:06 - number two what is the tag used for a
15:08 - list item number three write the code
15:11 - for a link to your school's website and
15:13 - number four what is something you should
15:15 - keep in mind when creating links to
15:17 - other web pages you created that is
15:19 - going to be the end of this video thank
15:20 - you guys so much for watching and we'll
15:22 - see you next time bye
15:25 - you

hi guys welcome back to kids for code day 3 my name is Zoe and I'm going to be your teacher for today so today we are going to be learning about how to create lists and links and HTML before we get started we are going to go over the answers to some to the summary questions that I left you off with in the previous video so question number one what is the tag that you must have at the very top of your code and that is going to be your document type so make sure that you have the exclamation part exclamation point right before the word doctype number two what is an empty tag mean an empty tag means that there is no closing tag and that there's only one of that tag this tag does not need to surround any other content so normally tags there's an opening and a closing tag however an empty tag means that there is only one of it and it does not need to surround any sort of content so in the last video we saw examples of this through the BR tag which creates a new line and the HR tag which creates a horizontal line number 3 what is the difference between an h1 and an H 6 tag h1 is the most important and h6 is the least important which means h1 creates a bigger heading than h6 so the text that you surround with h1 tags makes it bigger than text these surrounds with h6 tags and in the last example as you saw as we progress from h1 to h2 h3 h4 h5 and h6 the text is becomes smaller and smaller and so finally h6 is the smallest so if you ever wanted to create a big announcement then use an h1 tag number four what is a toggle you would use to create a line break and that would be the BR tag now notice with empty tags like this you put a forward slash right here before the closing bracket ok now we are going to learn how to create a skeleton now what is a skeleton a skeleton is all the code that you need whenever you create any sort of new HTML project so this is all the code that you need when you create any sort of HTML project now it's kind of annoying how you have to

to manually type all of this code into your new project every single time so I'm going to demonstrate how you save that so in my brackets file right now I have my skeleton open now I'm not going to type any content into here this is just the code that I wanted to save for future projects so what I'm going to do is file save as I'm calling a skeleton dot HTML make sure you always put HTML at the end of your document and I'm saving it in my kids for code website now it's called skeleton because this code is the bare bones of every HTML project that you will create so it's important they give it someplace safe and you save it okay now we are going to learn how to create lists so first we have an ordered list an ordered list means that there are numbers and by default it starts at number one and ascends an increasing order so these oh L tags surrounds the entire list and inside the Oh L tags you have list items so these are the things that are on your list each list item has to be surrounded with this tag so here we have an example items to buy for college and notice up title of this was created with an h1 tag next we have our opening oh el tag and our closing Oh el tag and now inside we have each of our list items laptop minifridge laundry basket and notice how each item has its own set of Li tags next we have an unordered list an unordered list means that there are no numbers the order of the list items doesn't matter and use bullet points so here we have an example of ice cream flavors the title has been created with an h1 tag now we have our opening UL tag and our closing UL tag and now inside we have each of our list items chocolate vanilla and strawberry and the tags that you use for list items doesn't change regardless of whether you're using an unordered list or an ordered list so each of our list items is surrounded with an opening and closing Li tag and the order that you type in type it in in the code is the same order that it will appear in your browser and by default the bullet points are going to be small small black circles called disks so the cool thing you can do with ordered lists with all types of Lists actually is nesting and nesting is when you put one list inside of another list so here we're back with our ice cream flavors we have our unordered list chocolate vanilla strawberry however inside our chocolate list item we created a new list and in our new list we have dark milk dark milk so with nesting you can get a lot more specific with each of your list items we have more specific chocolate flavors right here so we have an unordered list right here nested inside this list item of chocolate now notice how the opening tag of chocolate is right here right before they type the word chocolate and the closing tag is right here after the closing tag of the unordered list that is nested inside now we have another example this time with an ordered list so here we have a todo list we have our opening closing tags and we have two items do laundry and walk the dog however inside do laundry we have a listed a nested list and we have more specific instructions on how to do the laundry so first carry the baskets basement to sort dark and light colors and three check settings on machine so we have this ordered list that gives more specific instructions on how to do the laundry now we are going to learn how to create links so first we're going to learn how to create links to other websites so this is the full tag on how you do it so this is how you do it first you create an opening bracket lowercase a space href equals open quote and this is where you paste the full URL of the website you would like to link close quote close this bracket and then here this word or you can have more than one word is where this link is going to be stored in so on the website the word Google is going to show up and if you click on the word Google it'll take you to this website google.com so in this way you can see that this link is stored inside whatever word is in here so I'm going to demonstrate by giving you another example so what I'm going to do is I'm starting a new HTML project right and as we said before I'm going to copy and paste all of the skeleton code copy new project and paste and always remember to save save as and I'm going to title this link example and don't forget dot HTML and we're going to save it in my documents kids for code folder save okay now I have the basic bare bones of what my project is going to look like now I want a website that I want to link so I'm going to go to the kids

let's type in the tag a space href equals now a nice thing that brackets does is that when you type in a quotation mark it automatically gives you a closing one so that you won't forget it alright now

looks like all right here we have kids for code I click on it and it takes me to the kids for code website now let's say I just delete this text and don't forget to save let's go back see now there's nothing here on my web page so even though that the link appears here in your code if there is no word right here to store the Lincoln then the link is not going to appear anywhere on your web page so although you can literally type any word let's say I type in the word unicorn save that see we have the word unicorn and I click on it and it takes me to the same website however unicorn doesn't really have anything to do with kids for code if you want to put anywhere here you want to make it a word that is relevant to the website that you're linking so I think kids for code is the best few words to describe what this link is so let's save that and let's go back click on it and it takes us to kids for code so that is how you create a link to another website now let's go to lick let's learn about how to create links to pages that you have already created so here we have three different files index about and dogs and this is the code for each of them and this is what index will look like in the web browser now something important about this is that if you want to create links like this all of these files have to be saved in the same folder so in this case about dogs index are saved in the same folder called dogs so I'm going to demonstrate let's go to my folder and here's my dog's folder and here are my three files so let's open them in brackets click on it right click open with brackets click on the file right click open with brackets ok so I'm going to live preview what each of these websites look like so this is the about me page let's see what that looks like you all right so about me it's right here and these are the two links to the other two pages this is just some filler text it doesn't really mean anything okay now let's live preview what dogs look like looks like dogs same thing only difference is that dogs is here and we have about an index whenever you're creating a website with multiple pages index just means the home page okay finally let's go to our index home page it's the same thing except it says welcome so the syntax is pretty much the same thing as linking another website however inside the two quotation marks you don't put oh you've website URL you put the name of the file so here we are in the about page right yeah okay so we have two links here the first link and the second link and notice how they're also inside a list an unordered list so we have a first link in our second link and in the two in the quotation marks we have the file name so this is the file name for index this is the file name for dogs so if we go to the website and we click on it index we're on the index page and if we click on my dogs we're on the docs page so let's go to the dogs page we have our two links here this will take us this should take us to the about page and this link should take us to the index page let's see if it works about page yes index page yes so as you can see the syntax is pretty much the same except instead of a website URL here you put the exact file name make sure you spell it correctly because syntax is very important you all right now we are we have some summary questions so the answers to these summary questions can all be found throughout the video so if you rewind and watch carefully and listen carefully then you'll be able to answer all of these questions so number one what is the difference between Al and ul tags number two what is the tag used for a list item number three write the code for a link to your school's website and number four what is something you should keep in mind when creating links to other web pages you created that is going to be the end of this video thank you guys so much for watching and we'll see you next time bye you
