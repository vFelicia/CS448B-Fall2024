00:00 - hello everyone I'm Ola and this is
00:03 - coding is for girls in this episode we
00:20 - will learn how to read and write files
00:22 - in Python so let's get started we could
00:26 - implement program that is waiting for us
00:28 - to create a file in desktop that is
00:32 - called secret dot texture and then open
00:36 - that read their content and add the line
00:39 - I know your secrets at the very bottom
00:41 - of the file and to make the things
00:43 - simple for us we'll just stick to the
00:45 - text files so we will not have any
00:48 - images or any formatting let's create a
00:51 - file called great secrets to the file
00:54 - what we would like to have is a while
00:57 - loop that is checking if there is a file
01:00 - called secret dot txt on our desktop and
01:03 - we want to check that all the time
01:06 - so in the moment we are creating the
01:08 - file program we'll do something with
01:11 - that and then stop let's start with
01:13 - defining variable we will call it check
01:16 - file and we first assigned true to that
01:19 - value of this variable will tell us if
01:23 - we want to check for existence of the
01:25 - secret dot take step i'll on desktop and
01:28 - as long as this file is true we'll keep
01:32 - repeating that in a while loop now we
01:34 - will type while check file column and
01:38 - inside we want to check if the file
01:41 - really exists inside desktop folder but
01:45 - we don't know yet how to do that in
01:46 - Python and here comes peyten OS model
01:49 - for the rescue but wait what is the
01:53 - model in all my previous videos we kept
01:57 - creating different Python files and they
02:00 - were containing variables and functions
02:02 - and we even splitted some of them into
02:06 - smaller pieces and using from something
02:09 - in word structure we managed to use
02:12 - code from one file in another and model
02:16 - in Python is exactly like this is a file
02:19 - or directory of multiple files
02:22 - containing different variables and
02:26 - functions that we can import and then
02:29 - use whenever we need that and I hope you
02:32 - remember that we did something like this
02:34 - when we talked about functions and I
02:37 - will place the link in the description
02:39 - below so you know which video I'm
02:42 - talking about and to make programmers
02:44 - life even easier Python comes with some
02:48 - stuff that is already written for you
02:50 - and ready to use so called standard
02:53 - modules and if you are curious what is
02:57 - available for you in standard modules
02:59 - make sure to take Python library
03:01 - reference as always link will be in
03:04 - description below but let's go back to
03:07 - earth model or to be more precise - Oh s
03:10 - dot path model this model contains a lot
03:14 - of interesting functions that help you
03:16 - to deal with files so what we want to do
03:19 - in our program step one is to check if
03:22 - the secret dot take step file exists in
03:26 - desktop and the good news is that us did
03:29 - path model contains the function that
03:32 - will help us with that
03:33 - it's called exists if we took Viton
03:37 - documentation you will see that this
03:39 - function require one argument path but
03:44 - what is path you ask path is a string
03:48 - that defines the location of a file or a
03:50 - folder if you remember command line
03:54 - video there was a comment called PWD or
03:58 - on Windows that was a city that let us
04:02 - know where on our computer which folder
04:05 - we are in and this will be handy right
04:08 - now for us so let's open command line
04:12 - and navigate desktop CD desktop and now
04:17 - let's type PWD and click enter and since
04:21 - we are in a slash user slash now
04:24 - there is a name of your user slash
04:27 - desktop ok so let's use this value in
04:30 - our program but first we need to import
04:33 - us module so let Phi 2 know we want to
04:36 - use functions and variables from this
04:39 - module and maybe you remember that to
04:42 - import something to let Phi to know how
04:45 - to use code that is outside of the
04:47 - current file we use construction from
04:50 - something import and the name of the
04:53 - thing we want to import but there's also
04:55 - other way and if you want to import
04:58 - everything from the module or the file
05:01 - you just type import and the name of the
05:04 - module and I will newsletter in this
05:07 - case so we will type import OS that
05:11 - means that we are importing Python
05:14 - standard library or module called OS the
05:18 - convention is to do all the imports at
05:21 - the beginning of the file then inside
05:24 - Wilder body we will type OS don't pop
05:28 - dot exists and in the parentheses we'll
05:32 - place the text we just copied from the
05:34 - command line it is called the path now
05:37 - since we want to check it as secret dot
05:39 - takes to exist in this location will add
05:42 - secret dot text are after the slash the
05:46 - end of the path Python documentation
05:48 - states that exist function returns
05:52 - either true or false
05:54 - so let's store the result in some
05:57 - variable let's call it file exists now
06:00 - if the file is there is prints a message
06:02 - so we'll type if file exists print
06:07 - sucribe dot txt a file exists we would
06:12 - like our program to wait until someone
06:14 - creates the file print information that
06:17 - the file exists and closed so all we
06:20 - need to do here is simply set check file
06:23 - to false ok let's save and run in the
06:27 - console Python free read secret stood
06:30 - fire when we click enter right and start
06:33 - running but nothing really happens
06:35 - it goes over and over again inside while
06:38 - loop checking if the file exists let's
06:41 - create the file on desktop that is
06:43 - called secret dot texture I can do it in
06:46 - Auto and as you can see the moment I
06:48 - saved this file my Python program wrote
06:52 - secret don't text a file exists and it
06:55 - closed yay
06:56 - that's the success now the only
06:59 - remaining bit is to open the file read
07:02 - the content and add the line at the very
07:05 - end of the file and open the file we
07:08 - will use Python open function we will
07:11 - use the same path to the file we use to
07:14 - track if the file exists so it's a good
07:16 - idea to store this value in the variable
07:18 - and reuse it so we'll type path to file
07:22 - and then we'll copy paste the path then
07:25 - we will replace text inside exists
07:29 - function with this variable if the file
07:32 - exists we will use open function to open
07:35 - the file so let's type secret file
07:38 - because we want to have this file in the
07:40 - variable equals open path to file now we
07:46 - would like to print everything inside
07:48 - the text file line by line and we can do
07:51 - that like this for line in secret file
07:55 - colon and in the body bold print line so
07:59 - we go row by row and print everything
08:01 - finally since we open the file we also
08:05 - need to close it we do that by typing
08:08 - secret file dot close ok we are done
08:12 - here
08:12 - time to save and run our program in
08:14 - console but first let's add something
08:17 - inside our secrets takes the file I
08:19 - think I will write hello world this is a
08:22 - super-secret file I will also make sure
08:25 - to save now when we run our script in
08:27 - console so I will type Python freed read
08:30 - secret to the file we see that
08:32 - everything from the file was printed
08:35 - congratulations you just learn how to
08:37 - read files in Python but we are not done
08:40 - yet we still need to add I know your
08:43 - secrets line at the very end of the file
08:45 - in Python
08:47 - there is a method write that
08:48 - us to do that let's try that just before
08:52 - the line we are closing the file so
08:55 - secret file dot right I know your
08:58 - secrets cool
08:59 - let's save and try to run it in console
09:01 - Oh No there is an error the error says
09:05 - that file not open for writing well why
09:08 - is that
09:09 - Python open function opens the file in
09:12 - read only mode by default so we cannot
09:16 - write anything to the file and it will
09:18 - take closer look at item documentation
09:21 - for open function will discover that
09:24 - this function has optional argument that
09:27 - defines what kind of operation you want
09:30 - to do with the file
09:31 - either we want to read right appened
09:34 - or maybe a mix of those what I want to
09:37 - do in our program is pretty much just
09:40 - reading and appending to the file so we
09:43 - will need two modes are for reading and
09:46 - ending and this function expects us to
09:50 - write it as R plus so let's add it as a
09:53 - second argument now we will save and run
09:57 - in the console item 3 read secrets to 5
10:00 - we have a content of the file printed
10:02 - and it will open secret that takes the
10:05 - file again we will notice that the line
10:07 - with I know your secret is added to the
10:10 - file congratulations
10:12 - now let's try everything again let's
10:14 - delete secret takes the phone now we
10:17 - will run our program Python 3 with
10:19 - secret sauce 5 which is waiting for us
10:21 - to create secret stops texture file
10:25 - so time to create one and we will add
10:28 - text like hi there here is my password
10:30 - my password now we see that our Python
10:35 - script worked and printed content on the
10:37 - file and we can see that extra line with
10:40 - I know your secret is there amazing job
10:44 - you just learn how to read and write
10:46 - files and fightin and you can do so many
10:50 - interesting things with that so I
10:52 - encourage you to look at the Python
10:54 - documentation and read a little bit more
10:56 - about files and how to handle them and
10:59 - if you don't want to miss any of my
11:02 - videos and you want to learn how to
11:04 - program with me make sure to subscribe
11:07 - this channel and stay tuned have a
11:10 - lovely day and see you
