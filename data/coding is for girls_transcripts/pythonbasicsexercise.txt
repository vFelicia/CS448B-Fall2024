00:00 - hello everyone I'm Ola and this is
00:02 - coding is for girls today I'm I prepared
00:21 - for you two exercises that you will be
00:24 - able to solve using things we already
00:26 - learned about Python if you missed any
00:29 - of my previous video make sure to look
00:31 - at the playlist I created there will be
00:33 - linked in the description below and
00:35 - watch it first learning fighting syntax
00:38 - is one thing but similar to all natural
00:42 - languages if you are not using the
00:45 - language then you don't really know it
00:48 - so the most important tip I have for you
00:51 - is to exercise exercise and exercise as
00:55 - much as you can I have two programming
00:58 - challenges for you you can try only one
01:01 - of them or both of them and you can make
01:04 - them as detailed as you wish in a week
01:07 - or so in my next video I will show you
01:10 - an example program that is solving this
01:13 - exercises so you would be able to
01:16 - compare your solution with the one I
01:19 - proposed to you the idea here is that
01:21 - you have a chance to solve the problem
01:25 - on your own without seeing how I did
01:28 - that and try to figure out it on your
01:31 - own using the tools we already know and
01:34 - syntax of feyten we talked about and the
01:39 - thing with programming is that there is
01:41 - no one and only one possible way to fix
01:44 - something or to solve the problem there
01:47 - are many things you can do in different
01:49 - ways this is the same with natural
01:52 - language you can communicate something
01:55 - using different sentences and different
01:58 - words but the meaning will be pretty
02:00 - much the same so the main challenge here
02:03 - is to make your program work okay
02:06 - challenge number one since I moved to UK
02:09 - I'm super confused with imperial units
02:12 - for me
02:13 - is natural to use metric system but
02:16 - sometimes I just needed to convert
02:18 - things from centimeters to inches and
02:21 - from inches to centimeters and I never
02:23 - remember how to do that my first
02:25 - challenge is writing a program that does
02:28 - exactly this first your program should
02:30 - ask user to provide a number of
02:32 - interests then it should wait for user
02:36 - to type the number and click enter then
02:40 - it should take the value and convert it
02:43 - into centimeters as a quick hint one
02:46 - inch is 2.54 centimeters and the tip
02:51 - here is not to use integer numbers in
02:53 - Python but decimals then it should print
02:56 - answer and you should replace number and
03:00 - result with a calculated values for
03:03 - example for two inches rule print two
03:05 - inches is 5.08 centimeters okay this is
03:12 - the first challenge and bonus points are
03:14 - for making sure that if user provides
03:17 - some incorrect value so instead of
03:19 - number they will print some text that is
03:22 - not convertible into number it will not
03:25 - crush but display some nice error for
03:28 - example this is not number please
03:30 - provide correct value in time for more
03:33 - complicated challenge and I hope that
03:35 - will teach you more Python that any
03:38 - video can potentially did how many times
03:41 - in your lifetime you had to solve test I
03:44 - must admit I hated tests at school I
03:47 - felt so limited and my strategy this old
03:50 - test is very bad but the good thing
03:53 - about tasks is that you don't really
03:55 - need a human to score the test and my
03:59 - second challenge for you is writing a
04:01 - test that will ask 10 different question
04:04 - to the user and present four possible
04:07 - answers when only one is true okay let's
04:12 - break it down into pieces at the
04:15 - beginning the program should ask first
04:16 - question and four possible answers for
04:19 - example would fight and keyword is used
04:23 - to start defining the function
04:26 - one death to funk three bar for function
04:34 - then it will wait for user to type one
04:37 - two three or four then second question
04:41 - is displayed and it waits for an answer
04:44 - then third fourth and so on when user
04:49 - answer the last question we should take
04:52 - all answers and check against the
04:55 - correct answers and calculate the score
04:57 - and you should score one if user
05:00 - answered the question correctly and zero
05:03 - otherwise
05:05 - finally you display the result are you
05:09 - excited I hope you are and you will not
05:14 - wait any longer and to sit down with
05:17 - your code editor and start a program the
05:20 - first challenge I'm sure it will be
05:23 - frustrating at times you will not start
05:25 - there will be different kinds of errors
05:27 - that you haven't seen so far but this is
05:31 - exactly the point to learn how to deal
05:33 - with that with the moments when you
05:35 - don't know what to do if you are stuck
05:37 - make sure to watch all my videos very
05:40 - carefully you could also try to google
05:44 - your answer just open your browser and
05:47 - search for the phrase or describe the
05:50 - problem you are experiencing and try to
05:52 - find solution derp or as a friend or
05:56 - just comment down below and I'll try to
05:58 - look at your questions there in my next
06:01 - video
06:02 - you will see how I solve this problem
06:04 - using the things I already showed you
06:06 - and you will be able to compare your
06:10 - code with mine and as I said there is so
06:13 - many ways to implement the same thing
06:15 - and the program that one person wrote
06:18 - probably slightly different than another
06:20 - and it's fine but it's also very
06:23 - interesting to compare and learn new
06:25 - things I hope you are motivated now to
06:28 - start and if you write something
06:30 - interesting make sure to share it I'm
06:32 - really interested what you are writing
06:34 - you can just comment down below or share
06:37 - it on my Facebook page
06:39 - I hope you enjoyed this video and if you
06:42 - want to learn how to program with me
06:43 - make sure to subscribe this channel
06:45 - and stay tuned have a lovely day and see
06:49 - you
