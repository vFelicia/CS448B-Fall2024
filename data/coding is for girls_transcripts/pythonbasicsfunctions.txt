00:00 - hello everyone I'm Ola and this is SCS
00:03 - for
00:04 - [Music]
00:16 - girls today as promised I will show you
00:20 - how to write your own custom functions
00:22 - in Python but first we need to answer
00:25 - the question what is a function we all
00:27 - remember functions from math and all the
00:31 - complicated formulas for example the one
00:34 - that calculates the area of the square
00:36 - maff defines function as a relation that
00:40 - associate a set of possible inputs into
00:44 - a set of the possible
00:46 - outputs but that's to abstract for us so
00:50 - let's take a look at functions from the
00:52 - real word point of view for example how
00:55 - to make a cup of tea you will need a cup
00:58 - a teab buug water to to make it so
01:00 - you'll take a capup put tea back inside
01:03 - your cup and then boil the water and
01:06 - pour it inside then you wait until the
01:09 - water changes color take the tea back
01:11 - out and your tea is ready there are
01:14 - quite a few steps to make a tea R and
01:16 - each single step is even more detailed
01:19 - as you can see in real world we already
01:21 - use the shortcuts to Define certain
01:24 - algorithms for example how to make a tea
01:27 - so what is a function in computer
01:28 - science it is it's a nice way to Puck
01:31 - all the steps into one nice thing one
01:34 - block of code and then reuse it for any
01:38 - values you will provide any combination
01:41 - of cup teab back and water okay let's go
01:44 - back to python so how we Define the
01:47 - function each function in Python starts
01:50 - with the keyword def it means that
01:52 - python will know that we are starting to
01:55 - define the function then we need to
01:57 - provide the name in this scenario we
01:59 - will call call it make tea now we can
02:02 - provide some input to the function our
02:04 - capup teabag and water then we can close
02:08 - parentheses and type colon as we already
02:12 - know colon means that we are starting to
02:14 - Define Block in Python and then we can
02:17 - Define all the steps for our function we
02:20 - just need to remember that in Python we
02:22 - Define a block with indentation let's
02:25 - open a file in our code editor and let's
02:28 - start with some super easy function
02:31 - first to start defining function we type
02:34 - def then we give it a name for example
02:37 - hi this function will simply greet you
02:40 - now we open parentheses here should come
02:43 - all the arguments all input we want to
02:46 - have but in this scenario we don't want
02:49 - any so we can go ahead and close it with
02:51 - parenthesis again now it's time for
02:54 - column and we are ready to define body
02:56 - of our function what we want to do here
02:59 - is is to print hi there and in the next
03:02 - line how are you note that we have the
03:05 - same indentation so both lines are
03:08 - inside the function now let's try it in
03:12 - console we save the file and run it in
03:14 - console like this Python 3 and then the
03:17 - name of your file in my case it's python
03:20 - intro remember to be in the correct
03:23 - folder when running it from console we
03:25 - need to be in the very same place as our
03:28 - python intro file in my scenario it's
03:31 - desktop if you feel lost make sure to
03:34 - watch my previous python
03:36 - videos if we run it now nothing happens
03:40 - why is
03:41 - that this is because function is an
03:44 - algorithm or a sequence of steps it's
03:47 - like a difference between describing how
03:50 - to make a t and actually making one
03:53 - let's open the file and execute the
03:55 - function High we do that typing name of
03:58 - the function in this scenario Hi and
04:01 - then
04:02 - parentheses if we had any arguments we
04:05 - would need to give them here function
04:07 - High expects to get nothing so we could
04:10 - close parentheses and save the file now
04:13 - let's go back to the console and type
04:16 - python free and then name of our file
04:20 - this time we have hi there how are you
04:24 - displayed okay but let's write a
04:26 - function that takes some input some ARG
04:29 - arents it would be nice if our high
04:32 - function is saying High using the name
04:35 - of the person right let's open python
04:38 - intro file again and let's change the
04:41 - file we will add name as a parameter we
04:44 - will place it inside parenthesis now
04:47 - let's remove the body of the function
04:49 - and try it once again from scratch let's
04:51 - say that in this function we would like
04:53 - to check if the name is Ola and then
04:55 - print hiola or if the name is Sonia use
04:59 - hi Sonia greeting or say hi Anonymous
05:03 - overwise if that sounds unfamiliar make
05:06 - sure to look at my previous video about
05:08 - conditions in Python okay let's start if
05:12 - name equals Ola We will print hiola L if
05:16 - name equals Sonia print hi Sonia and
05:21 - else print high
05:23 - Anonymous now it's time to save and
05:26 - check how our program runs in console we
05:30 - go back to console and run once again
05:32 - Python 3 python intro uhoh there is an
05:36 - error but as I already said it errors
05:39 - are your best friends so let's take a
05:42 - look it says that in line 10 we forgot
05:45 - to add argument to function High it even
05:48 - gives us name of the argument that's
05:52 - awesome let's fix it then we go back to
05:55 - console and run once
05:58 - again congrats you just created your
06:01 - very first function that takes argument
06:04 - and makees something meaningful with it
06:07 - but let's go one step further let's say
06:10 - we always want to say hi and the name of
06:12 - the person let's delete the body of the
06:15 - function with this complicated if
06:17 - statement and write instead print high
06:21 - plus name plus exclamation mark and then
06:25 - let's call it with some other name for
06:27 - example
06:28 - Rachel let's say the file and run it in
06:30 - console python free python intro it
06:33 - printed correctly High Ral as we wished
06:37 - now it's time to experiment a little bit
06:39 - more what if we want to write some
06:42 - mathematical function we could create a
06:45 - function that calculates area of the
06:47 - square we can add a function in the very
06:50 - same file under definition of high we'll
06:53 - type def ARA so the name of our function
06:58 - then in parenthesis we will provide the
07:00 - argument the input in this scenario it
07:03 - will be side of the square then in the
07:06 - body of the function we will print side
07:10 - multiple side so mathematical formula of
07:13 - the area of the square now we could call
07:16 - the function with different length of
07:18 - side of the square for example area with
07:22 - argument two or area with argument four
07:26 - let's remove calling High to we don't
07:28 - want it displayed for now
07:30 - let's save the file and go back to the
07:32 - console let's type Python 3 python intro
07:35 - and we got values of area of square with
07:38 - side two and one with side four the last
07:42 - thing I want to show you is returning
07:44 - values so far our functions were just
07:46 - printing values on the screen but what
07:50 - if the value is more important and we
07:53 - want to use that to some further
07:56 - calculations for this very reason we
07:59 - have a keyword return let's modify our
08:02 - ARA function and instead of print site
08:05 - multiple site we will replace it with
08:08 - return side multiple side now let's save
08:12 - the file and run it in the console
08:15 - nothing is displayed of course we did
08:18 - not print anything here but we could do
08:20 - it in the moment we call the function
08:24 - let's change area of two into print of
08:28 - area of two now we are printing the
08:30 - thing that function area returns to us
08:35 - when we run now the script we will get
08:38 - for
08:39 - printed okay let's go one step further
08:42 - let's store the value that is return
08:45 - from the ARA function in a variable
08:48 - called small square area and use this
08:52 - value as a argument to the area function
08:56 - again so we will get big Square AR area
09:00 - let's type small square area variable
09:03 - and assign the value returned from
09:05 - calling area function on argument two
09:09 - then in big square area variable we will
09:12 - stall the result from area called with
09:15 - argument small square area and finally
09:18 - we will print big square area now let's
09:20 - save and run it in the console python 3E
09:24 - python intro that's correct this is
09:27 - super exciting now you can write as many
09:30 - functions as you want and use the values
09:33 - returned from them to run in other
09:37 - functions for example what you could do
09:40 - is write one function that is taking the
09:42 - name and make all the characters in your
09:45 - name capitalized and return it and then
09:49 - use the result of that into your high
09:52 - function so in the end you will say hi
09:55 - and the name that will be capitalized
09:57 - functions are very important important
09:59 - in computer science and they are not
10:02 - easy to write but with a little bit of
10:04 - practice I'm sure you will very soon
10:07 - know how to write nice functions and you
10:10 - already know the basics next thing I
10:13 - want to show you is also super exciting
10:16 - it's
10:16 - Loop this is something that gives us
10:19 - even greater control in our program but
10:22 - for now I hope you enjoyed this video if
10:25 - you want to learn how to program with me
