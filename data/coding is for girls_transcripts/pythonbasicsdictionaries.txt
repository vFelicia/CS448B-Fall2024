00:00 - hello everyone I'm Olaf and this is
00:02 - shouting is for girls last time we
00:18 - talked about fighting basics we learn
00:20 - about three building types in Python
00:23 - texts integers and lists and today we're
00:27 - gonna talk about next building type of
00:30 - dictionaries similarly to the list it's
00:33 - more complicated structure that stores
00:35 - multiple values but instead of accessing
00:38 - them by their positions of the index we
00:40 - access that by P ok it sounds really
00:44 - abstract so we need an example when you
00:47 - want to call your friend what you need
00:49 - is her phone number so you open your
00:52 - phone the phone book and look for your
00:55 - friend's name and the number is under
00:57 - the name the name of your friends is a
00:59 - key and the number is the value stored
01:02 - in dictionary so if you compare it with
01:04 - the list we learned in the last episode
01:06 - you'll notice that we are accessing the
01:09 - phone number not by the position in your
01:11 - phone book but by the key so by the name
01:14 - of your friend so if you compare with
01:17 - the list we learn in the last episode
01:19 - you see that instead of knowing that
01:21 - exact position in the list you have a
01:24 - little shortcut your key so we can jump
01:27 - exactly to the place you want to be ok
01:30 - so even we start our phones in the list
01:33 - like this we would need to know that own
01:35 - of our friend Marta is under index free
01:39 - but if we use dictionary we just need to
01:42 - know her name Marta and we'll find the
01:45 - correct number immediately okay it's
01:47 - about time to play with dictionaries in
01:49 - Python open Python interpreter
01:53 - let's create an empty dictionary we do
01:56 - that by using curly brackets like this
01:59 - let's create a dictionary that actually
02:03 - contains some data for example let's
02:05 - create a variable with phone numbers
02:10 - okay that's it we just created a
02:12 - dictionary that contains four phone
02:15 - numbers
02:16 - similarly two lists values in a
02:20 - dictionary could be different stops
02:21 - let's say we would like to create a
02:24 - dictionary with informations about
02:25 - lottery participants we would like to
02:28 - store information like name of the
02:30 - person country phone and person's
02:33 - favorite numbers if we would use list
02:36 - for that we could store the information
02:38 - in a list like this but now when we
02:42 - would like to check their country of the
02:44 - person we would need to remember that
02:46 - country is under index - it's not easy
02:49 - to remember and making mistake is very
02:52 - easy here but if we use dictionaries it
02:56 - will become much nicer we will add a key
02:59 - to each element the first one is
03:01 - person's name though the country and
03:04 - finally favorite numbers but then each
03:09 - per key and value is defined the way we
03:12 - first start the key name then : and
03:15 - value here it will be named Ola then
03:19 - when we want a second birth this time
03:21 - country and Poland we needed to use
03:24 - comma separated from the previous birth
03:27 - and type again key first colon and value
03:30 - after that now let's add phone and
03:34 - numbers to
03:36 - now let's see if we could access follows
03:38 - easily for example would like to know
03:41 - what is the participant name we type
03:44 - print participant open square
03:48 - parentheses name is our key and close
03:52 - parentheses so the way the axis value is
03:56 - very similar to the list but instead of
03:58 - accessing using index we use let's check
04:03 - the country now neat okay but what
04:08 - happens when you ask Python for the
04:10 - value of the key that is not in the
04:13 - dictionary let's try and see for example
04:16 - we don't have any key called age in our
04:20 - current dictionary if a minute ago you
04:22 - thought that fighting will arise error
04:25 - you were right we have new type of error
04:28 - this time it's a key error that tells
04:30 - you that there is no given key in the
04:33 - dictionary in this case a key age okay
04:37 - let's think about other things for
04:40 - example what happens if you define the
04:42 - same key twice in the same dictionary
04:44 - for example we will create action area
04:47 - like this with name defined twice one
04:50 - with Cola and one with lace what do you
04:52 - think would happen will have error well
04:56 - let's hit enter and find out this time
04:58 - will have no error but does it mean that
05:01 - peyten saved all the values let's bring
05:04 - the dictionary as you can see will lost
05:06 - the first definition for a key name
05:09 - containing Cola it works a little bit
05:12 - like variables whatever stores last will
05:15 - stay in a dictionary in our scenario
05:17 - with the find name list as the last
05:20 - thing so that will be saved in
05:22 - dictionary okay but when we should use
05:25 - this and when dictionaries in Python
05:27 - code then if you need to store data that
05:31 - are a sequence of items and order is
05:34 - very important
05:35 - then using list is the most natural
05:37 - choice for example if you have a list of
05:40 - people you want to phone then storing
05:42 - that in list like this hola
05:45 - Marta and lace makes the most sense
05:48 - however if
05:50 - you want to store values the way it is
05:52 - easier to access data and order is not
05:56 - that important storing values in
05:58 - dictionaries like in the phone book is a
06:00 - better choice I'm sure after some
06:03 - experiments and writing a little bit of
06:06 - more code you will have a better
06:08 - intuition when to use which one there
06:11 - are other similarities between lists and
06:13 - dictionaries for example both are
06:16 - mutable well what does it mean basically
06:20 - it means that once you created one in
06:23 - the list or dictionary you still can
06:26 - change values you can add them you can
06:29 - delete them and you can change existing
06:33 - ones with that like this will add
06:37 - favorite language key to our participant
06:40 - dictionary now when we print the
06:42 - participant favorite language is one of
06:45 - the values similarly to lists and
06:48 - strings you could use function
06:51 - land on dictionary let's try it on
06:53 - participants
06:54 - yeah the result is 5 so basically it
06:57 - tells us how many pairs key and value
07:00 - our dictionary stores at the moment
07:03 - similarly to lists we could also delete
07:07 - element using though like this the
07:10 - participant favorite numbers now
07:13 - favorite numbers are no longer in the
07:15 - dictionary
07:16 - finally let's check how to change value
07:18 - of the certain key for example let's
07:21 - change country from Poland to UK we do
07:24 - that like this participant country
07:27 - assign UK now let's check our dictionary
07:31 - and yes it contains UK instead of Poland
07:35 - now that was exciting I really love that
07:37 - something as simple as dictionary you
07:40 - see so much power if you want to learn a
07:43 - little bit more about dictionaries in
07:45 - Python
07:45 - visit the link I am displaying right now
07:48 - and read a little bit more it's very
07:50 - fascinating you can learn more about
07:52 - building function in dictionaries what
07:54 - is possible and what is not we already
07:56 - learned how to store values things like
07:59 - text integers how to store things
08:02 - lists and dictionaries which is awesome
08:05 - but what if you want to do something
08:06 - more in my next video I will talk about
08:10 - comparing things I hope you enjoyed this
08:13 - video and if you want to learn how to
08:15 - program with me and don't miss any of my
08:18 - next videos make sure to subscribe my
08:21 - channel and stay tuned have a nice day
08:24 - and see you
