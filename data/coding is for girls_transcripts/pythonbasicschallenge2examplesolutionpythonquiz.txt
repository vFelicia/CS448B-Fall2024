00:00 - hello everyone I'm Ola this is coding is
00:04 - for girls in my previous video I gave
00:19 - you two challenges to solve using
00:21 - everything we learned so far about
00:23 - Python I will place the link to this
00:26 - video description below I already showed
00:29 - you how to solve the challenge number
00:31 - one in the video I will also place a
00:34 - link somewhere in description below and
00:37 - it's time to challenge number two so
00:39 - let's start with reminding what
00:42 - challenge number two was all about we
00:45 - wanted a program that asks a first
00:48 - question and gives you four possible
00:50 - answers then it waits for user to type
00:53 - one two three or four then second
00:57 - question is displayed and it waits for
00:59 - your answer then third fourth fifth and
01:03 - so on when user answers the last
01:06 - question we should check how many
01:08 - answers user answered correct and
01:11 - calculate the score we add one if user
01:14 - answer the question correctly and zero
01:17 - otherwise
01:18 - finally we want to display your score is
01:22 - result out of number of questions okay
01:26 - so we want to open our code editor and
01:28 - start coding but before we do that we
01:32 - need to have ten questions for our quiz
01:34 - and I wouldn't be myself if the question
01:38 - won't be related to Python here is a
01:41 - little quiz for you I will show you all
01:43 - the questions I preferred and if you
01:45 - want to check your 5 in knowledge grab a
01:48 - piece of paper or open the file and mark
01:51 - down all the answers you think are
01:54 - correct - rule number one is what
01:59 - command to use on mark to create a new
02:02 - folder in console 1 and Qadir to make
02:07 - dr3 dr4 LS
02:12 - question number two how do you define
02:15 - text or string in Python 1 only wrapping
02:20 - a text with single quotes 2 only
02:24 - wrapping text with double quotes 3
02:27 - wrapping a text with single or double
02:30 - quotes or even with triple double quotes
02:33 - for none of the above is true next
02:38 - question is how you could transfer
02:40 - number to string in Python one using
02:44 - float function to using STR function 3
02:48 - using string function for using dot text
02:53 - method fourth question is when you
02:57 - compare two values and want to check if
02:59 - value a is equal to value P how do you
03:03 - compare it in Python 1 using equal sign
03:07 - to using equal equal sign 3 using
03:11 - exclamation mark equal sign for using
03:15 - lower than and then greater than sign
03:19 - question number 5 what is a correct way
03:23 - in python to represent boolean true
03:26 - value 1 trip to capital true 3 1 for
03:32 - true with capitalized first letter
03:35 - question number 6 if you want to create
03:38 - a dictionary in Python you use 1 square
03:42 - brackets 2 normal brackets 3 curly
03:47 - brackets 4 lower than greater than signs
03:51 - question number 7 if we have dictionary
03:54 - like this participant equals name Ola
03:57 - languages polish English and German
04:00 - country Poland how we would check how
04:03 - many languages all aspects one learn
04:06 - from participant with key languages to
04:09 - participant from languages count free
04:13 - land from participant for participant
04:17 - from languages dot items question number
04:21 - 8 when we want to define a function in
04:23 - pi
04:24 - what keyword we use one funk to function
04:29 - free VAR for death question number nine
04:34 - which from below is not correct boolean
04:37 - operator in Python one and two x or
04:41 - three or four not and the last question
04:45 - is which of the below is correct syntax
04:49 - in Python when defining for loop one for
04:53 - the you in users - for VAR new in users
04:58 - free for you in users four for each user
05:03 - in users I hope you wrote down all your
05:06 - answers somewhere and you will be able
05:09 - to compare with correct answers very
05:12 - very soon the first thing we need to do
05:15 - is copy all our questions and answers
05:18 - into our Python file let's start with
05:22 - creating a file named quiz to try and
05:25 - copy the text of the questions as I just
05:28 - presented it to you let's fix the file
05:31 - so all the lines containing questions
05:34 - are proper strings in Python we will use
05:37 - backslash and for the newline in string
05:40 - so I will use it for each questions
05:43 - right now I will make sure to end every
05:46 - question with it and place it between
05:49 - every answer for each question I will
05:52 - store the first question in variable
05:54 - named question one and I will do the
05:57 - same with all other questions it's very
06:00 - very repetitive so let's go first
06:03 - forward and yes we're done now
06:06 - so what we want now is to display the
06:09 - first question and wait for users answer
06:12 - we will use input function for that and
06:15 - check my Python basics user input and
06:18 - dealing with errors video if you don't
06:20 - remember this function we will type now
06:22 - in the file answer equals input from
06:26 - question 1 then we want to also have all
06:29 - the answers for all the remaining 9
06:32 - questions let's repeat the line and
06:35 - store answer
06:36 - invariables answer to answer free and so
06:39 - on and so on
06:40 - last step in the challenge was to check
06:42 - what is the score of the person will
06:45 - need a variable result which is 0 at the
06:48 - beginning so result equals zero and then
06:51 - we'll check every single answer if it's
06:54 - correct for this we will use if
06:56 - statement now it's a moment of truth
06:58 - take your answers of your question and
07:00 - compare with correct answers why I will
07:04 - type we remember that we get a string
07:06 - from the input method so we'll make sure
07:09 - to compare with a string representation
07:11 - of the answer so let's look at the first
07:14 - question the correct answer was answer
07:17 - number one so we will type if answer 1
07:20 - equals string 1 : and in that indented
07:26 - block you want to add one point to the
07:28 - result so we'll type result equals
07:31 - result plus 1 now let's look at question
07:34 - number 2 this time the correct answer
07:36 - was answer number 3 so we'll type if
07:39 - answer 2 equals 3 result equals result
07:44 - plus 1 now in case of question 3 the
07:47 - correct answer was to question number 4
07:51 - had answer to question 5 answer number 4
07:55 - question 6 answer number 3 question 7
08:00 - answer number one question 8 ah sir
08:03 - number 4
08:04 - question 9 answer number 2 and question
08:08 - 10 answer number 3 okay we calculated
08:11 - the result so that only missing bit is
08:14 - to display the result of the quiz let's
08:17 - type print your score is curly brackets
08:21 - out of 10 questions don't format result
08:25 - we are using format method here that I
08:28 - showed you in my previous video when I
08:30 - talked about how you could implement
08:32 - challenge number one so make sure to
08:35 - check this solution too even if you
08:37 - haven't implemented tarnish number 1 and
08:39 - you skip that previously okay time to
08:42 - check our program let's go to the
08:44 - console and type Python 3 wasted 5 and
08:48 - answer questions
08:50 - I'm very lazy so I will answer to all of
08:53 - them with answer 1 and in the end my
08:56 - result is two correct answers out of 10
08:59 - out if we look into the code now we see
09:03 - it ugly there is so much repetition so
09:06 - many each statement that looks pretty
09:08 - much the same and I hope you remember
09:10 - that if you do similar code multiple
09:12 - times for many different elements you
09:15 - can use for loop and this is what we
09:18 - will do now we will replace all this tan
09:22 - if statements with only one that is
09:25 - wrapped in the Florida let's go back to
09:28 - our file what we want to do is look over
09:31 - every question from one to ten so to do
09:34 - that we will store all the questions in
09:36 - a question variable and we'll store it
09:40 - in the list like this questions equals
09:43 - list and now we'll put all the variables
09:46 - so question 1 question 2 question 3 4 5
09:50 - 6 7 8 9 and 10 now when we have a list
09:55 - we can iterate in there for loop over it
09:58 - so we will have for question in a
10:01 - questions : okay but now there is a
10:04 - problem because we have number of
10:06 - different variables answer one answer
10:09 - two and so on and each of them have
10:11 - different correct answer but what we can
10:15 - do is store in our questions variables
10:18 - in the list not only question itself but
10:21 - also a correct answer and answer that
10:24 - user gave let's change each row here to
10:28 - contain inner list first will be the
10:31 - question then answer from the user and
10:34 - last one will be expected correct answer
10:37 - so for question one will have list
10:40 - question one answer one and one then for
10:45 - question to answer two and three and so
10:48 - on for each of the question now inside
10:52 - our for loop we will change the code to
10:55 - catch all three values for each row at
10:58 - once I hope you remember how to do that
11:00 - we simply specify names for
11:03 - each value separating them with common
11:06 - so we will have it like this now for a
11:09 - question , answer comma correct answer
11:12 - in questions then in the block we want
11:16 - to check if users answer is equal to the
11:19 - correct answer or not
11:20 - so if answer equals correct answer and
11:24 - inside we will have the old code result
11:27 - equals result this one okay now we can
11:31 - delete all previous gifs just make sure
11:34 - to leave result equals zero because we
11:36 - still need it now we can run the code in
11:39 - console and see that our reactor in was
11:42 - successful and we still have fully
11:44 - working quiz let me prove the code even
11:47 - more now we have 10 different variables
11:50 - with all the questions and then we pack
11:53 - them inside the questions list maybe we
11:56 - could merge this tool instead and we
11:59 - will know which correct answer
12:00 - correspond to each question let's copy
12:03 - each question inside the questions list
12:06 - and delete all question 1 question 2
12:09 - question 3 and so on so when we finish
12:11 - we have something like this and let's
12:14 - run it in a console then I can free
12:16 - waste of 5 Oh No we have an error this
12:21 - is because we just lit it all the
12:23 - variables question 1 question 2 and so
12:25 - forth and we need them to store all
12:28 - answer one answer to answer three
12:30 - variables but the thing is we don't
12:33 - really need to do that before our for
12:36 - loop instead let's move catching the
12:38 - user answers inside our loop this way we
12:42 - will have a question so we can display
12:44 - input from question start the value and
12:47 - then compare it with the correct answer
12:49 - it will be super nice right let's do it
12:52 - now we will remove all answer one answer
12:55 - two and so forth then we don't have them
12:58 - anymore so we need to remove all of them
13:00 - from questions list we have now each row
13:03 - with question and correct answer only so
13:07 - in our for loop we need to remove answer
13:10 - bit and instead inside will ask user for
13:14 - the answer for each question
13:16 - like this answer equals input from
13:20 - question and then we can easily compare
13:22 - newly stored user answer with the
13:25 - correct answer and update users result
13:29 - let's save and track if our program
13:31 - still works Python 3 quiz 5 in the yes
13:35 - it works like charm
13:37 - thanks to this change we can easily add
13:40 - any number of questions to the list it's
13:43 - all about adding our question and
13:46 - correct answer to questions variable and
13:49 - then our quiz will have more questions
13:52 - in 10 but there are other ways to make
13:55 - the wasted 5 program even nicer
13:58 - for example now question and answers are
14:01 - not very readable in the code we can
14:04 - refactor the code to make it more
14:06 - readable for us what we could do for
14:08 - example is changing our inner list
14:10 - containing question with answer and
14:13 - correct answer into dictionary that
14:16 - contain every single bit under separate
14:19 - key for example question will be under
14:21 - question list of answers will be under
14:25 - key answer and we will have correct
14:27 - answer separately to its right to
14:30 - electorate then we will start with the
14:32 - first question we will create a
14:34 - dictionary so we use curly brackets now
14:37 - under key question we will place whole
14:40 - question but we will cut all the
14:43 - possible answers we can now remove
14:45 - backslash n so the enter from the string
14:49 - and now under possible answers key we
14:52 - will split remaining bit into a list of
14:56 - answers like this possible answers 1 and
15:00 - Khedira to make dr3 dr4 LS and each time
15:06 - we remove backslash n since it is no
15:08 - longer needed and finally we will store
15:11 - 1 under correct answer key and we can
15:14 - close that dict now let's refactor all
15:17 - remaining questions
15:19 - it is so tedious so let's have a little
15:23 - fast-forward
15:25 - okay we're done now when we save the
15:28 - file and who tried to run our code we'll
15:31 - end up with an error we get value error
15:33 - too many values to unpack yeah we just
15:37 - completely changed elements in questions
15:40 - for Yahoo from a list to a dictionary we
15:43 - need to fix it instead of question and
15:46 - correct answer will simply catch
15:48 - question definition and we will have a
15:51 - full dictionary inside with all answers
15:54 - and question text and correct answer
15:57 - then we want to show question and all
16:00 - the possible answers let's print it like
16:02 - this print question definition from
16:05 - question and then for possible answer in
16:08 - question definition possible answers
16:11 - print possible answer finally change
16:14 - input function to display three greater
16:17 - than signs instead of the questions like
16:20 - this now correct answer should be
16:23 - changed into question definition correct
16:25 - answer okay we're done here time to
16:28 - track if the code still works let's go
16:30 - back to console and run it again item
16:32 - three we stood by it still works perfect
16:36 - this video is already quite long and I
16:39 - have so many ideas how to improve the
16:41 - code but instead of creating 30-minute
16:45 - long video that nobody will watch I want
16:47 - to show you one small improvement for
16:50 - the code now and suggest next step that
16:53 - you can implement on your own
16:55 - so currently our program treats us a
16:57 - correct answer only those that are
17:00 - exactly 1 2 3 or 4 but if we add space
17:05 - before or after our answer our program
17:08 - will treat it as incorrect thing so if
17:11 - we for example answer phase one where
17:15 - the one is a correct answer our programs
17:17 - tell things that we answered incorrectly
17:20 - it is not nice to prevent it we can use
17:24 - one of the Python building methods
17:27 - called string this cuts all the white
17:30 - space before and after text let's first
17:34 - see what happens when we always type
17:37 - space and then one instead of just one
17:40 - in every question previously when we
17:43 - always gave one as an answer our end
17:46 - result was two out of ten questions
17:48 - let's run the program in console and
17:51 - type space one every single time this
17:54 - time we had exactly zero good answers
17:57 - this is because space 1 is different
18:00 - from just one let's open our code editor
18:03 - and try to fix it in if statement we
18:07 - compare answer with correct answer here
18:09 - we would like to use Python straight
18:12 - method so we will do answer dot string
18:15 - and open and close parentheses this will
18:19 - cut all spaces before and after the
18:22 - answer ok let's save and time to test it
18:25 - in console we type Python 3 quiz at 5
18:28 - this time even though we typed Space 1
18:31 - we still got two answers correct out of
18:34 - 10 congratulations the possible next
18:38 - step here would be to make sure that if
18:41 - user type 1 dot or 2 dot our program
18:45 - still treat it as a correct answer it's
18:47 - very possible right another thing we
18:49 - could do is not letting user to go to
18:53 - the next question
18:54 - until they provide one of the possible
18:57 - values so 1 2 3 or 4 so if the user type
19:01 - olá our program still would say this is
19:05 - not one possible answer can you provide
19:08 - one for this question we can do that
19:11 - using while loop but the thing is I
19:13 - haven't introduced while loop to you yet
19:15 - this is my plan for the next video I
19:18 - hope you had an amazing time trying to
19:20 - implement all the challenges I've
19:22 - prepared for you I must admit I had
19:24 - great great fun filming these videos
19:27 - next time as I already suggested I will
19:30 - talk about while loops so if you are
19:33 - interested what the while loop is what
19:36 - is the syntax and why I really really
19:39 - try to avoid using them unless it's
19:42 - absolutely necessary make sure to check
19:45 - out my next videos so if you want to
19:48 - learn how to program with me
19:50 - make sure does
19:51 - like this channel and stay tuned have a
19:54 - lovely day and see you
