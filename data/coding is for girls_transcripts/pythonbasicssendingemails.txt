00:00 - hello everyone
00:01 - I'm Ola and this is scouting is for
00:05 - girls
00:05 - [Music]
00:18 - if you are here and you haven't watched
00:20 - my video about reading CSV files in
00:22 - Python you need to stop and watch their
00:26 - video first because we are using python
00:29 - script we wrote last time as a base to
00:32 - the project we are building today and
00:34 - today we will take all email generated
00:38 - in previous video and actually send them
00:41 - to the people I'm so excited about this
00:43 - video and I hope you are excited too one
00:46 - of the most horrible things I sometimes
00:49 - see is when people send the same email
00:51 - to tens of people and they add every
00:54 - single email in a recipients
00:57 - this way I know email address is off
01:00 - everyone you send this email to and this
01:03 - is bad because email address is a
01:05 - personal data and you shouldn't share it
01:07 - with anyone without the consent of the
01:10 - person it's pretty much like giving
01:12 - names and phones of all your family and
01:15 - friends to anyone this is so bad one of
01:19 - the ways to prevent it is use PCC field
01:22 - in your email so you don't see email
01:24 - addresses of all the people who got the
01:27 - email
01:28 - however there is nothing better than
01:30 - personalized email that contains your
01:33 - name your personal data something that
01:36 - feels like written especially for you
01:38 - this is so much better and much more
01:41 - personal however it is very hard if you
01:44 - have hundreds of emails to send but
01:47 - worry not because today you will see how
01:49 - to do that in my previous video we'll
01:52 - learn how to load the data and generate
01:56 - personalized emails time to send them
01:59 - but first we need to talk about emails
02:02 - and something called SMTP simple mail
02:06 - transfer protocol we already talked
02:09 - about how internet works and that
02:12 - amongst others it uses HTTP protocol
02:16 - when you type something in your browser
02:19 - it uses HTTP to communicate with other
02:23 - computers out there connected through
02:25 - the internet but when it comes to emails
02:28 - we use different standard different
02:31 - protocol
02:32 - SMTP this is the format you need to use
02:36 - if you want to send email through the
02:38 - internet so other computers other mail
02:41 - servers will know oh yeah this packet of
02:44 - data is actually an email and should be
02:47 - treated as such thankfully we don't
02:49 - really need to go into too much details
02:52 - of the protocol because python of course
02:55 - comes with a standard model that helps
02:58 - us create emails
03:00 - so all we need to do is import SMTP Lee
03:04 - model and use it let's open the file
03:07 - with the script from last video and save
03:09 - it under new name for example send
03:12 - emails.py now we will take quick look at
03:15 - python documentation for SMTP leap
03:18 - module link as always will be in a
03:21 - description box below what we need is
03:24 - something that connects to our email via
03:27 - SMTP and send emails there so we will
03:30 - need this SMTP to connect and then
03:34 - thoracic function called send mail we
03:37 - will use using this tool will connect us
03:40 - with the mail server we are using and
03:43 - then we'll send all the messages we want
03:46 - to send to all the recipients now about
03:49 - mail server this is something that is
03:51 - running all the time waiting for emails
03:54 - to come or emails to send we could set
03:58 - up that and configure that locally on
04:01 - our computers but that will over
04:03 - complicate this video and it will be
04:05 - super long so instead of that I'll just
04:08 - use email and especially for this video
04:10 - I decided to create a Gmail account
04:13 - coding is for girls at gmail.com I will
04:17 - send all the emails to this mail server
04:20 - so what we want is our python script to
04:24 - generate the content which is already
04:26 - done
04:27 - and push it to Gmail mail server to send
04:31 - this email on our behalf so the first
04:34 - thing we need to give our script is the
04:37 - email address from which we will be
04:39 - sending the emails so in our scenario
04:41 - coding is for girls at gmail.com and the
04:44 - password to the account now
04:47 - you should never ever share your
04:50 - password with anyone don't save it in a
04:52 - file and post somewhere in Internet
04:55 - don't leave it somewhere lying around on
04:58 - the computer that other people use this
05:01 - is your secret password and only you
05:03 - should know that and what I'm doing
05:05 - right now is only because I wanted to
05:08 - keep this video simple and I didn't want
05:11 - to have it like 30 minutes long so
05:14 - please please don't do that at home and
05:17 - if you really want to try it out just
05:19 - make sure to create a separate email
05:21 - account you don't actually use so
05:23 - something that even if it's hacked it's
05:26 - perfectly okay so what I'll do now is
05:28 - take my credentials the email and my
05:31 - password and put it into settings file
05:34 - okay I will create a separate file on
05:36 - desktop that contains my newly created
05:39 - email and password I will call the file
05:42 - settings.pi I will store email and
05:45 - password in constants sender in email
05:47 - equals coding is for girls at gmail.com
05:51 - and send their password equals and here
05:54 - I'm typing my secret password but you
05:57 - will not see that I am saving the file
05:59 - and go back to the send emails.pi file
06:02 - we will import these two values at the
06:05 - beginning of the file like this from
06:07 - settings import sender email sender
06:11 - password now we need to connect the
06:14 - Gmail SMTP server we will do that using
06:17 - SMTP leap Library so we need to import
06:20 - it first so at the beginning of the file
06:23 - we type import SMTP lib now let's scroll
06:27 - down to the place where we are about to
06:30 - start processing data from the CSV file
06:33 - just before the for Loop we need to
06:35 - start a connection and we do that like
06:37 - this SMTP we will store the connection
06:40 - in variable smftp equals SMTP lib dot
06:46 - SMTP and as a parameter will give
06:50 - smtp.gmail.com the argument here
06:53 - smtp.gmail.com is specific to the email
06:56 - server I'm using so Gmail I am sending
06:59 - everything from my gmail address so I'm
07:01 - using that but if you use different one
07:04 - just try to browse what value you should
07:06 - use for example if you use Yahoo you
07:08 - could browse for SMTP server address
07:11 - Yahoo here it is I found it
07:14 - smtp.mail.yak.com okay let's go back we
07:17 - already know how to connect to Gmail
07:19 - SMTP server now we need to log in with
07:23 - our email and password if we take a look
07:26 - at python documentation we will find a
07:28 - method login we need to give a username
07:31 - so the email and password so in our file
07:34 - we will type SMTP Dot Login sender email
07:39 - sender password okay so it's time to
07:42 - send email right let's go to python
07:44 - documentation once again and look for
07:46 - something that will help us with that
07:48 - and here it is send mail method it
07:51 - expects us to give a sender email
07:53 - address first then recipient address and
07:56 - the message let try that in the file we
08:00 - will replace all the Sprints with sendik
08:02 - email we will do that like this SMTP so
08:06 - our connection to email server dot send
08:09 - mail now we will open parenthesis sender
08:13 - email this is the one we will be sending
08:16 - emails from so in my case coding is for
08:18 - girls at gmail.com then email this is
08:22 - the email of the recipient and finally
08:25 - our email message we generated above
08:27 - cool now the last thing let's close the
08:30 - connection with Gmail server here after
08:33 - the for Loop we will do SMTP quit let's
08:37 - save and try if it works and one more
08:39 - thing I made sure that all email
08:42 - addresses in
08:44 - applications.csv are my emails
08:47 - when I test my python script and I don't
08:49 - know if it works or not I don't want to
08:52 - spam all the people out there okay let's
08:55 - type python free send emails.pi oh no
08:59 - there is an error SMTP auf extension not
09:02 - supported by server this is bad
09:05 - we did something very very stupid we
09:09 - pretty much took our email address and
09:11 - password and send it in the plain text
09:14 - for the internet without encrypting that
09:17 - that means that any person who is
09:20 - looking at Pockets that are sent from
09:22 - our computer just learn about our email
09:25 - and password
09:26 - this is not good to prevent it we will
09:29 - use TLS transport layer security let's
09:33 - open python documentation once again and
09:35 - see how to do that there is a method
09:38 - called start TLS it says all SMTP
09:42 - commands that follow will be encrypted
09:44 - you should then call echner again oh
09:48 - what is eclo let's take a look this is
09:52 - something we should call to identify
09:54 - ourselves when connecting to SMTP server
09:58 - okay so that means we need to call eclow
10:01 - first then we need to start transport
10:04 - layer security with start TLS and then
10:07 - do eclip again ah and since I sent my
10:11 - password without encryption through the
10:13 - internet already I also changed my
10:15 - password immediately let's save the file
10:18 - and try it now Python 3 send emails at
10:21 - pi
10:23 - this time script finished without error
10:26 - but let's check if I received any emails
10:29 - at all so I'll open my Gmail account to
10:32 - which I was sending all the emails and
10:34 - the one I changed password to a moment
10:37 - ago and here they are all the emails we
10:40 - send Evo will open the emails we'll see
10:43 - that every message is customized for
10:46 - each person from the spreadsheet that is
10:49 - great
10:50 - this is amazing we just sent emails
10:53 - generated Based on data from spreadsheet
10:56 - and this way we can pretty much send
10:59 - tons of emails like this in a one go but
11:02 - there is still one thing that is not
11:04 - perfect yet
11:06 - not sure if you noticed that but all the
11:08 - emails don't have any subject yet let's
11:11 - fix that we'll open the send emails file
11:13 - and inside the if where we generate
11:16 - email content we will also decide what
11:19 - the subject should be if the person is
11:21 - accepted we will store in variable
11:24 - subject Workshop application accepted
11:27 - and for rejected people we will have
11:30 - subject equals Workshop application not
11:33 - this time but how to add subject to the
11:36 - message we're sending well it is quite
11:38 - easy it turns out that all you need to
11:40 - do is concatenate the message with
11:42 - subject and you do that as follows
11:44 - subject colon then here we will add our
11:48 - subject
11:49 - then empty line and then the message we
11:53 - want to send let's do that email message
11:56 - equals subject colon now we will have
12:00 - placeholder slash n which is newlines
12:03 - dot format subject message it will
12:07 - replace message with email message
12:09 - inside send mail click save and try it
12:13 - in console Python 3 send emails to the
12:16 - pi the script finished so let's check if
12:18 - send emails had the subject this time
12:21 - and yes they do this is amazing and I
12:24 - hope you are super excited and you just
12:26 - can't wait to use the knowledge I shared
12:29 - with you to create something useful
12:31 - however there are some warnings for you
12:33 - do not share your email and password
12:36 - don't save it in a file don't share it
12:39 - with others don't leave it on computer
12:41 - laying around if you happen to send your
12:45 - email and password without using
12:47 - transport layer security make sure to
12:50 - change password immediately and one more
12:53 - thing if you use two-factor
12:55 - authentication the script we just
12:57 - created won't work there are other ways
12:59 - how to do that you need to generate some
13:02 - special key and so on but this is topic
13:05 - for a separate video and last but not
13:08 - least do not spam people
13:12 - we all hate useless messages and all the
13:16 - ads we are getting and receiving them is
13:20 - super super annoying
13:21 - so please please don't do that remember
13:24 - send emails only to people who agree to
13:28 - receive emails from you without their
13:31 - consent you shouldn't do that okay
13:34 - that's it for today let me know in the
13:36 - comments what kind of project you would
13:38 - like to write on create which will use
13:42 - sending emails I'm really interested in
13:45 - all your ideas and what you want to
13:47 - build and if you want to learn how to
13:49 - program with me make sure to subscribe
13:52 - to this Channel and stay tuned have a
13:55 - lovely day and see you
