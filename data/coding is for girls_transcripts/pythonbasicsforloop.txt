00:00 - hello everyone I'm Ola and this is
00:02 - counting is for girls I hope you had fun
00:18 - learning Python with me so far if you
00:21 - are here for a first time make sure to
00:23 - look at my previous video in a correct
00:26 - order to make any sense out of this
00:28 - video I created a playlist so you can
00:32 - just go there there is a link in
00:34 - description below and watch them in a
00:37 - correct order also make sure to visit
00:39 - Jungle Girl tutorial I already put all
00:42 - the links to this video out there so you
00:45 - can follow those steps there and look at
00:48 - the videos simultaneously the link to
00:51 - the drama girls tutorial is in the
00:53 - description below ok today we will talk
00:56 - about something exciting loops
00:59 - what is loop similarly to the if
01:02 - statement it is something that allows us
01:05 - to control flow in programming in case
01:10 - of its statement we could decide which
01:13 - line is executed depending on the
01:15 - condition in case of loop we will be
01:18 - able to repeat the same steps many many
01:21 - times for every single element in it
01:24 - even set or until some condition is not
01:28 - generals programmers are very lazy and
01:31 - don't like to write the same code many
01:34 - times there is even a famous try
01:37 - principle don't repeat yourself and
01:40 - thanks to that you will write something
01:43 - only once and use it whenever possible
01:46 - so if you need to change it at some
01:48 - point of time you don't need to go over
01:51 - 400 occurrences and chained it for every
01:54 - single place for example if we have a
01:58 - list of girls like this so invariable
02:02 - girls we will have Rachel Monica Phoebe
02:05 - and Ola and we would like to breed them
02:07 - using a function hi we created when
02:10 - talking about functions we could do that
02:13 - like this hi Rachel hi Monica
02:16 - hi Phoebe and viola then when we save it
02:21 - and run it in console titan-3
02:24 - and the name of the file would have all
02:26 - of hi and names printed
02:29 - however we could use loop to write it in
02:32 - a more compact way and thanks to that it
02:35 - will be very easy to create for women as
02:38 - well as for a hundred to define loop in
02:42 - Python we'll use another keyword this
02:46 - time is a keyword for we will write it
02:49 - as follows
02:50 - 4 then we'll choose name of the variable
02:54 - here simply name then we will write
02:58 - keyword in and after that we will place
03:01 - our list stored in variable girls then
03:05 - there comes : as you already know :
03:09 - means that we define a block so next
03:11 - line needs to be indented now we'll call
03:15 - function high with name variable as an
03:18 - argument let's run it the result is the
03:23 - same but what this for in structure
03:27 - really means it means that for each
03:30 - element in a set or list in this
03:33 - scenario for each name of the girl we
03:37 - will assign girl name to the variable
03:40 - name and execute everything in the block
03:43 - here
03:44 - huhai let's say it step-by-step
03:48 - at the beginning we assign rachel to
03:52 - variable name now inside the body we use
03:57 - variable name and call function hi we've
04:00 - named Rachel then the loop finishes and
04:04 - we go back here at this point we assign
04:08 - the value Monica to name and we call hi
04:11 - with this next we go back and assign
04:15 - name Phoebe to name and call hi and
04:19 - finally we do the same with name hola
04:24 - this is what is called flow control we
04:27 - keep repeating the same lines of code
04:30 - for every single element in the list
04:33 - okay but what happens when we don't have
04:36 - a list for example if the variable girls
04:39 - contains number four not the list let's
04:43 - try it for name in four color print name
04:48 - now let's save and check in the console
04:51 - Python free Python intro to the file we
04:55 - get an error it says that integer is not
04:58 - big trouble
05:00 - basically loop expects us to give it
05:02 - something that contains elements is that
05:06 - list dictionary number is not like that
05:09 - it has no inner items so for loop cannot
05:14 - work with that let's try loops with
05:17 - dictionaries then we'll create one like
05:20 - this person with name equals hola height
05:24 - 155 centimeters favorite language Python
05:28 - and now we will iterate over the
05:31 - dictionary using loop so we will type
05:34 - for element in person so the variable
05:38 - name and then print element now let's
05:42 - save it and run in the console that's
05:45 - interesting in case of dictionaries what
05:48 - we have printed is not a pair key and
05:51 - value but only a key how we could access
05:56 - the value of them we could use one of
05:58 - the built-in methods for the
06:01 - dictionaries and access them directly
06:03 - the method is called values so we could
06:07 - write for element in percent values
06:09 - print element let's save and check in
06:13 - the console
06:15 - we could also access both key and value
06:18 - at the same time by using the built-in
06:21 - method items on dictionaries so for
06:26 - element in person items print a land
06:31 - that looks nice okay
06:35 - this time we got Paris but we can go one
06:38 - step further and on level of loops we
06:42 - could extract key and value and use it
06:45 - in nicer way we will use two variables
06:48 - this time
06:49 - so we will always assign key names to
06:51 - variable K and the value stored in a
06:54 - dictionary in the variable called volume
06:57 - then we will print person now we need to
07:01 - escape special character as we talked
07:03 - about it in my videos about strings then
07:06 - we add key but since we don't know if
07:09 - the key is text or number or anything
07:12 - else we need to make sure that we
07:14 - convert it into that we use built-in
07:17 - function STR for it then we type is now
07:22 - it's time to print value once again we
07:25 - use STR function to make sure we have
07:28 - text now let's save and try to run it in
07:30 - the console that looks nice if you
07:35 - wonder what would happen if we remove
07:37 - STR around volume we can try it now
07:40 - now when we save and run it will have a
07:44 - type error saying that we cannot add a
07:47 - text to the number finally let's look at
07:51 - the very useful Python building function
07:54 - called range it generates a given number
07:57 - of integers for example if you would
08:00 - like to have integers from 1 to 10
08:03 - instead of writing them by hand like
08:06 - this for a number in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
08:11 - and 10 we could write for number in the
08:16 - range 1 11 so basically anything between
08:20 - 1 and 10 would print a number now we can
08:25 - save and run it in the console and see
08:28 - numbers printed from 1 to 10 oh wow that
08:33 - was intense
08:33 - make sure to experiment a little bit
08:36 - more with libs in Python also visit this
08:39 - link to the Python documentation I will
08:42 - put this link in the description
08:43 - and next time we'll make something fancy
08:47 - we will make it possible to read values
08:50 - provided in the console to a program so
08:53 - here as a user will be able to pass some
08:58 - values to your program and then operate
09:01 - over it if you enjoyed this video and
09:03 - you want to learn how to program with me
09:05 - make sure to subscribe this channel and
09:08 - stay tuned have a nice day and see you
