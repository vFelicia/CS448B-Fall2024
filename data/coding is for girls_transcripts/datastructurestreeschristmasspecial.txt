00:00 - hello everyone I'm Ola and this is Goen
00:03 - for
00:04 - [Music]
00:24 - girls it's Christmas time I'm totally
00:28 - one of the oh my God oh my God it's
00:30 - Christmas type of person and I couldn't
00:33 - imagine not making a Christmas special
00:35 - for you on this channel when I think
00:37 - about Christmas one of the very first
00:40 - things I think about is Christmas tree
00:43 - no surprise then that today I decided to
00:47 - talk about trees not necessarily
00:50 - Christmas trees but computer science
00:53 - trees when you learn how to program at
00:55 - some point you will need to learn very
00:57 - basics of computer science as a science
01:01 - and in that moment you will learn about
01:03 - two very important things algorithms and
01:07 - data structors these two things are more
01:10 - abstract mathematical and more formal
01:13 - way to solve problems with computers on
01:16 - this level it does not really matter if
01:19 - you program in Python C hcll Java or any
01:23 - other programming language because
01:26 - talking about algorithms and data
01:28 - structures you go One Step Above the
01:31 - real world problems and instead of
01:34 - solving one particular problem you have
01:36 - you try to solve all the similar
01:39 - problems at once creating a recite to
01:42 - solve all of them in fact I know quite a
01:45 - few computer scientists that program on
01:49 - piece of paper so not using the real
01:52 - programming language but using some kind
01:55 - of programming asira called soda code
01:58 - and they solve more General problems but
02:01 - let's go back to our trees there is a
02:03 - number of different data structures out
02:06 - there but wait what is a data structure
02:10 - well data structure is something that
02:12 - helps us store and organize our data so
02:16 - we can access that very quickly imagine
02:19 - that you go to the library and you want
02:21 - to find certain book if the books lie
02:24 - around without any organization then
02:26 - finding the one you are interested in is
02:28 - super hard but if your library has all
02:31 - books sorted alphabetically finding the
02:34 - one you are interested in is much easier
02:37 - the same is with data structures they
02:39 - help you to organize your data and keep
02:42 - them in order okay so once we know what
02:45 - is a data structure we can move to talk
02:47 - about trees first why they are called
02:50 - trees well because when you draw them
02:53 - they look a little bit like
02:55 - tree but upside down the idea of the
02:58 - tree is that you have here iicle
03:00 - structure for example if you think about
03:02 - all the directories you have on your
03:04 - computer they are in a tree structure
03:07 - the most top directory on your computer
03:09 - is a tree root and root directory has
03:12 - many subdirectories and those
03:15 - subdirectories has other subdirectories
03:17 - and so forth and so forth let's say we
03:20 - are in directory named Ola this
03:22 - directory contains desktop documents
03:25 - download Library pictures then desktop
03:28 - has folder docs and and my stuff Library
03:31 - folder has accounts calendars cookies
03:34 - and favorites then each of the folders
03:37 - has subfolders and files and so on and
03:39 - so on it already looks like a tree but
03:43 - upside down so we already know what is a
03:45 - tree as a data structure but what makes
03:48 - a tree a tree tree consists of nodes if
03:51 - we look at the directories on your
03:53 - computer then each directory is a Noe
03:56 - and these nodes have to be organized in
03:59 - a here hicle structure I think I used
04:01 - word here hickle like 10 times already
04:05 - there are different kinds of tree and
04:07 - there are different so-called
04:08 - implementations of trees but today we
04:11 - will not talk about all of the details
04:14 - because there is no time it's Christmas
04:16 - anyway okay so time to learn some
04:19 - special names and keywords that are very
04:21 - important when talking about trees in
04:23 - computer science on the very top we have
04:26 - a root this is the highest node in the
04:29 - whole here hey you can think about them
04:31 - as a boss well in this scenario it's
04:33 - just a star then we have a descendant or
04:38 - children all notes Here ornaments on our
04:42 - Christmas tree are siblings to each
04:45 - other our ornaments on the first level
04:48 - could be par of the new notes on Next
04:51 - Level well it's kind of similar with a
04:54 - gical tree and similarly to that we have
04:58 - a concept of of ancestor for this note a
05:01 - star is an ancestor also the immediate
05:05 - parent is also an
05:07 - ancestor finally when we go down our
05:10 - Christmas tree we will reach last layer
05:13 - of
05:14 - decorations these are called leaves they
05:17 - have no children and they are the
05:19 - youngest
05:19 - generation probably the Christmas tree
05:22 - analogic is not the best one because it
05:24 - does not emphasize the fact that all the
05:28 - nodes are connected in a certain way but
05:30 - honestly I couldn't resist having a
05:33 - Christmas tree on one of my episodes and
05:36 - I think Christmas tree analogy would
05:38 - work if we simply make our Christmas
05:40 - tree invisible and to make it hold its
05:44 - Christmas tree shape we'll need to
05:46 - connect all the ornaments with strings
05:48 - the strings that connect parents with
05:50 - children in our scenario ornaments are
05:53 - called edges but what if the ornament
05:57 - has more than one parent like we would
05:59 - like to add an extra support and make
06:01 - this decoration be connected with two
06:04 - parent nodes well this is not a tree
06:07 - anymore but there's a name for it in
06:10 - computer science it's called
06:13 - graph okay we know the
06:15 - basics but where are we using the trees
06:19 - are they any useful first it's perfect
06:22 - to represent any hierarchical data
06:25 - imagine how easy it is to represent SP
06:28 - link this way it's so intuitive and so
06:32 - easy or the company hierarchy with the
06:34 - boss as a root trees are also very
06:37 - useful when it comes to searching if
06:40 - each note contains some information and
06:43 - there is a certain way in which the tree
06:46 - was created so you know that things
06:49 - with' given properties are in a certain
06:51 - part of the tree then finding a thing
06:53 - that you are interested in It's
06:55 - relatively easy and quite fast like in a
06:58 - big library for example if you want to
07:00 - read a Harry Potter book you enter the
07:02 - library your root you find a room that
07:06 - contains books that have outter surnames
07:08 - starting from P to Z then you find a
07:11 - bookcase that contains books with outs
07:14 - from R to S and then you find the Shelf
07:17 - with outer starting with r and then
07:20 - you'll find your book this is exactly
07:21 - the trace structure and it is much more
07:24 - efficient than trying to check every
07:27 - single book in the library there there
07:29 - are so many places in programming and
07:32 - computer science where trees are used
07:34 - for example in 3D video games trees
07:37 - might be used to calculate what should
07:40 - be displayed for you they are also used
07:42 - in compression so if you have files like
07:45 - jpex or MP3 then probably some trees
07:49 - were involved when creating this files
07:52 - there is so much more about trees and
07:55 - honestly my first scenario for this
07:57 - episode was so long that I would
08:00 - probably spend whole week just recording
08:03 - that and there will be like 10 videos
08:05 - but I have to leave it for now because
08:07 - it's Christmas and I really want to
08:09 - spend some time with my family friends
08:11 - okay so time to sum up we learned that
08:14 - there is something called data
08:16 - structures in computer science and it's
08:18 - something more abstract more formal and
08:21 - this is the level on which we start to
08:24 - notice that this is actually the science
08:26 - in computer science then we learned
08:29 - about trees as a data structures trees
08:32 - are hercal structures with nodes one
08:35 - roote the most top one parent ancestors
08:39 - and leaves they are connected with edges
08:41 - our string connecting parent with
08:44 - children finally we briefly talked about
08:47 - where trees are used I know it's a
08:50 - little bit theoretical but if you are
08:52 - interested and like me you think it's
08:55 - something elegant and fascinating go
08:57 - ahead and bro in the internet and learn
09:01 - more about it it's really really
09:03 - beautiful thing also if you feel lucky
09:05 - you can try to implement your tree using
09:08 - things we already covered in previous
09:11 - episodes it won't be super elegant but
09:14 - it's possible and if you're up to
09:16 - challenge just go ahead experiment and
09:19 - don't be afraid to use internet in this
09:21 - case too but for now have a wonderful
09:24 - Christmas if you celebrate it and if you
09:27 - don't just have a wonderful day time if
09:29 - you want to learn how to program make
09:32 - sure to subscribe my channel and stay
09:34 - tuned have a lovely day and Merry
09:38 - [Music]
09:57 - Christmas
