00:00 - Hi! I'm Ola and this is coding is for girls ... [ Musik]
00:15 - In all films like "Matrix", "Tron: Legacy" or "Mr. Robot"
00:21 - hackers, programmers or administrators just have this black window
00:26 - and they write text very, very fast and computer does magic
00:30 - Well, today I' going to show you something that allows you
00:35 - to feel al little bit like them.
00:37 - and I hope that "Command line" will be your new best friend.
00:41 - When you open your computer, smartphone or tablet everything is shiny and beautiful
00:50 - but it was not allways this way.
00:52 - If you've every seen the older computers: They whole interface is textbased.
01:00 - Now when technologic is so much more advanced
01:03 - We can do amazing stuff.
01:05 - We can use mouse, touch-pads or touch screens
01:11 - and this is much, much more intuitive.
01:13 - But there are times when using text it's much more powerful
01:20 - and so much easier.
01:22 - But before we will open command line and start to larn something
01:28 - I want you to think first about how a bunch of electronics ends up running
01:37 - amazing programs and displaying compilcated thinks for us.
01:45 - Computers are a little bit like onions:
01:47 - They have layers.
01:52 - First lowest core layer is hardware
01:55 - Then we have the second layer, which is operating system
02:01 - So Winwows, linux, iOsX, android, chrome os - all of them are operating systems
02:09 - And they are your way to communicate with hardware
02:13 - I like to think about operating systems like something that gives order to hardware
02:20 - For example if you want to save the file on the disk
02:24 - you just give an order to operating system
02:26 - and it does it for you
02:28 - The third layer is applications
02:31 - All your programs like photoshop, finder or internet browser
02:36 - All of these are specialist applications, that you use
02:43 - And there is a fourth layer: You, the user
02:50 - I also like to think about computers not only as onions but also like about big corporations.
02:58 - You are boss and you give orders to applications
03:02 - Applications give orders to your operating system
03:05 - And your operating system is giving  orders to hardware, that does the work.
03:11 - But imagine that you as the boss want to have mor cotrol over your operating system   or applicatios
03:19 - or you want to make so applications to work with each other
03:24 - Well, you will need special skills for that.
03:28 - And command line ist the perfect macht.
03:30 - A differnt operating system calls command line slightly different, but they are pretty much the same thing.
03:39 - It might be calles command line, prompt,  console, terminal, shell , bash
03:45 - There are so many names but in fact it's a text interface to give your operating system and applications orders.
03:54 - In the Mac to open  command line we need to go to finder, then to applications
04:02 - Utilities and then choose terminal.
04:04 - Don't be afraid to search instructions for your operating system or you can check out our awesome Django Girls tutorial.
04:11 - I'll put the link below in the description, so you can easily acces the correct chapter.
04:16 - Ok, so Command Line is opend.
04:20 - Here you see a little dollar sign
04:22 - It indicates that Command line is waiting for orders
04:26 - You can think about command line like about messenger that is waiting for a boss
04:32 - to give orders and that should takes these orders and make sure that operating system or applications are doing that.
04:40 - Whenever you see $ that means:The job is done and the Command LIne ist waiting for new orders.
04:49 - Let's first check if the command line knows who you are
04:52 - To do that we will type:Whoami
04:56 - It will return your User name. Nice.
04:59 - So beeing the boss if you want to know what's going on in your company
05:04 - You might want to  visit different playes and see what is going on.
05:07 - You probably already know what directory or folder is.
05:12 - Sometimes I like to think about them as physical places. So if you have that file, you can think about them as a piece of paper
05:21 - put in certain building, room, cupboard and shelf.
05:26 - So, if I'm the boss I would like to visit different rooms
05:29 - and see what's going on, whats happening
05:32 - Normally when you use your computer you just use one of  the specialised programs like finder or windows explorer to do that.
05:41 - But this time we will do that with Command Line.
05:44 - Let's check in which directory you are right now.
05:48 - Let's type pwd, which is a shortcut "from print working directory".
05:55 - And click Enter.
05:57 - Now we will have displayed complete information: Where are you
06:00 - In this case in the "Users" folder in folder "ethlinn"
06:05 - OK, so now time to do some  inventory
06:09 - To do that, I will type "ls" from "list" and click Enter.
06:15 - Now we have the list of all the directories and files in here.
06:19 - Applications, desktop documtents and so on.
06:24 - OK, so inspection done. Time to go to some other directory and see what is there.
06:29 - But as like walking trough the building, we need to go trough certain corridors, doors and rooms to go to the certain place.
06:39 - The same is with directories.
06:41 - Let's say we want to go from "ethlinn" to "Desktop".
06:45 - To do that we need to type "cd Desktop" and click Enter.
06:51 - CD stands for "change directory"
06:53 - Now let's check where we are with a command we've alrerady learnt.
07:01 - Now we are in "Users/ethlinn/Desktop
07:05 - Let's make an inventory here, too.
07:09 - If we want to go backwards, we need to type two dots instead of the name of the folder
07:16 - So  went back we have to type "cd .." and click Enter.
07:24 - Ok, let's go back once again to "Desktop" directory
07:31 - But let's be lazy this time. We want Command Line to guess what we are trying to do.
07:35 - And command line is pretty good at guessing.
07:38 - If you don't want to type whole complicated directory or file names
07:43 - You could start typing it and than click the Tab-Key
07:46 - It will try to guess what you want to type
07:48 - And if there's more than one possible match you need to click Tab twice  and it will display you the list of options
07:59 - Now let's create a new directory
08:02 - Let's type "mkdir practice", where "practice" is the name of the directory you want to create. And click Enter.
08:11 - This will create an empty directory
08:14 - OK, so let's check if it's there. Type "ls" and yes, it's there.
08:20 - If you still don't believe go ahead and check it in the finder or just in "Desktop". See:It's there.
08:28 - Let's go inside the "practise" Folder using "cd practise"
08:34 - If you want to use the same command over and over again. Let's say we want to create folders "practise 2", "practise 3" and "practise 4"
08:43 - Instead of writing everything from scratch over and over again you could use up and down arrows
08:50 - So what we do is click up arrow and then edit "practice" adding numbers 2,3 and 4.
09:04 - OK, let's say that we want to delete some directory completly.To delete a whole directory, we will use command "rm"
09:13 - This is the shortcut for "remove"
09:16 - But first let's go back to the desktop: We do "cd .." and now we are in the correct location
09:26 - Ok, so let's type "rm practice"
09:32 - And you should end up with a error.
09:34 - The error is "practice is a directory", which is true
09:38 - We just tried to remove a directory the way we move files, not directories.
09:44 - So what we do instead is typing "rm -r practice"
09:52 - "-r" means "repository". So we kind of ask your Command Line to do all the work for you.
09:59 - Now let's check if it's gone. Type "ls": Year, it's gone!
10:06 - Ok, so that's it. I showed you the very, very basic commands. Command line is very powerful.
10:15 - I realy encourage you tried it on your own.
10:18 - Hope, you had fun today and you're not super bored and you're ready to start wirting your first python program with me.
10:27 - So next video will be about installing python and telling a little bit, what is a programming language?
10:36 - If you want to learn how to program make sure to subscribe my channel and stay tuned.
10:42 - Have a nice and see you!
