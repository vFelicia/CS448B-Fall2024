00:42 - fairly quickly so today I'm actually at
00:47 - the event this is going to be the chess
00:50 - state championships I am again coaching
00:52 - the high school chess team and that's
00:54 - what I'm here for
00:56 - so um I'm going to start walking around
00:59 - a a little bit ooh we have a lot of
01:01 - people here today so you can
01:03 - see what's going on I'm going to take
01:06 - you guys actually inside and give you a
01:09 - sneak peek hi T hi hello from Dubai hi
01:12 - nice to see you I'm going to actually
01:14 - take you guys inside and show you what
01:15 - the room looks like there are a ton of
01:18 - people in there there are hi divish yeah
01:21 - I didn't want to miss next live video
01:23 - Perfect there are going to be
01:26 - about a thousand over thousands of
01:28 - people in that room that I'm I'm going
01:30 - to show you they're all high school
01:31 - students playing at the state chess
01:33 - championships but it is dead quiet
01:35 - there's not a single sound it's very
01:38 - quiet so when I go in there I won't be
01:41 - able to comment it okay and I apologize
01:43 - about that I won't be able to talk I'm
01:44 - not allowed to talk I
01:47 - actually
01:49 - um oops you know I am the coach of the
01:54 - Nils North High School chess team so I
01:57 - actually I definitely can't talk because
01:59 - then they're gonna actually penalized
02:01 - the team
02:02 - so how it works is that eight of our
02:05 - students from NES North are versing
02:07 - against eight other students so it's
02:08 - like our team versus another team and
02:10 - there are 149 teams in there playing and
02:13 - then if there are five total rounds and
02:15 - if they
02:16 - win um then we go on to the next round
02:21 - okay so I'm going to show you guys
02:23 - inside but I cannot
02:28 - talk
02:34 - right now we are going upstairs I'm
02:36 - taking you guys upstairs with
02:40 - me we're going to be actually going into
02:43 - the
02:47 - event check it
02:51 - out it's a pretty cool place I think
02:54 - it's just a random car in here which is
02:56 - kind of
02:58 - weird I used to play here I used to be
03:04 - actually I so we're taking a break from
03:07 - coding right this is a coding Channel
03:09 - this is about programming but
03:12 - um I I can't be doing that right now so
03:14 - I decided I should still make a video
03:17 - for you
03:19 - guys
03:25 - okay
03:27 - oops so lots of stuff going on here
03:30 - we're getting closer to the room okay
03:32 - we're getting closer to the room we're
03:33 - almost
03:55 - there okay well then I will call her and
03:58 - she she said
04:08 - right all right thank
04:11 - you yeah so am
04:28 - I
04:58 - for
05:28 - for
05:35 - that's our
05:58 - team
06:28 - for
06:57 - should pushing
07:01 - okay that was a little too much silence
07:04 - so we're going to get out of there we're
07:06 - going to go back
07:08 - downstairs so
07:12 - basically uh that was the the team that
07:14 - I was recording was actually my team the
07:16 - NS North High School team and they were
07:19 - they were all the ones in the purple
07:21 - jackets
07:23 - and so far everybody's game looked
07:26 - pretty even to me it looked like nobody
07:28 - was losing on our team team but again I
07:31 - have to you guys have to know like these
07:33 - games are crazy long for
07:36 - example um in chess you can win by
07:40 - Checkmate or running out of time or
07:42 - making somebody else run out of time so
07:45 - their time on each side is like 2
07:47 - hours so that's a 4H hour long game for
07:51 - each kid and then I think they get an
07:53 - extra hour on top of
07:56 - that so these games can get very long
08:00 - but they're pretty smart so yeah they'll
08:03 - they'll play through it and then figure
08:05 - it
08:07 - out I'm going to go get some dipping dot
08:10 - ice
08:22 - cream
08:28 - okay what happened
08:31 - oo bad
08:37 - connection bad
08:45 - connection
08:50 - hi okay so for me it says bad connection
08:54 - oh um the name of this place I don't
08:57 - really know but I'm in Poria so if you
09:01 - look up ihsa Poria chess championships
09:04 - that's where I am
09:07 - at it keeps saying bad connection so I'm
09:10 - worried if it will
09:13 - disconnect I really hope it doesn't like
09:16 - last
09:20 - time um for some reason on my phone I
09:23 - can't see your guys' like messages I
09:25 - wish I could see that that would be cool
09:29 - Kaz you never thought to work in Google
09:31 - other big companies or have you
09:33 - tried no never really thought about okay
09:36 - so I wanted to do it right when I was
09:38 - studying and becoming really good and
09:40 - coding every day like 20 hours and then
09:42 - I would study all these algorithms data
09:44 - structures so I could actually apply but
09:47 - then in the end I ended up changing my
09:48 - mind I decided not to pursue the route
09:52 - of uh working for somebody I never
09:55 - really worked for somebody I always
09:57 - worked with clients that I would find on
09:59 - my my own did independent Consulting um
10:02 - generally was a lot of like independent
10:04 - contractor work that I've always uh been
10:07 - interested in doing and then I started
10:09 - building my own businesses off of that
10:12 - so I decided you know to go kind of
10:15 - entrepreneurial route and um you know I
10:19 - started my chess company called chess
10:20 - tastic so I was also doing some software
10:23 - development web development for that as
10:25 - well building things on my own so
10:30 - yeah um I had a dream of working in
10:33 - Google I thought that would have been
10:34 - cool then changed my mind but definitely
10:37 - if you guys want to do it definitely
10:39 - those are good places to join but always
10:41 - remember you know people always bring it
10:43 - down to Google or Dropbox those are not
10:45 - the only two places to work those are
10:47 - not the only places that will give you
10:49 - the most money so just remember
10:52 - that um really go somewhere where you
10:55 - enjoy um and it works out for you
10:58 - they're not only a few companies there
11:00 - are a bajillion people that need your
11:02 - help with software development and web
11:03 - development and whatever else right app
11:08 - development don't live telecast just

11:19 - I'll I'll be around today I'm going to
11:23 - be doing some chest stuff but later on
11:25 - it's going to get into more coding we

11:33 - and talk with you guys now there are a
11:35 - lot of people looking at me like I'm
