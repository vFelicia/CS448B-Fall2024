05:37 - to it like expenses I'm talking about
05:40 - this for two
05:41 - right
05:47 - talk to me how you got your first on it
05:51 - as a friend like that is something
05:52 - that's gonna get though valuable to
05:53 - people so take me through the detail
05:55 - process of like how long were you coding
05:58 - for what did you do to get that first
05:59 - client sure I mean putting Ruby or Ruby
06:03 - on Rails for nine years now - and a B
06:06 - McMullen startup since the time I left
06:08 - college so I have a lot of connections
06:11 - in the startup
06:12 - and once you get that gonna get kicked
06:14 - out of garden it's pretty easy okay I
06:17 - think Oh God was out of the
06:20 - relationships that you had built yes
06:22 - even even today every every Giga is
06:25 - because of the relationship of work and
06:28 - all those things don't really according
06:33 - to me I kinda get that yeah because of
06:36 - course you're competing on price with
06:38 - other people in the world who don't have
06:40 - this lifestyle they are in a single
06:42 - place so they can actually charge they
06:45 - will wheel it right than the price you
06:48 - would want for the Paulina
06:51 - so the best thing I would say for
06:55 - someone who want to get into this
06:56 - lifestyle is work for three to four
06:59 - years yep build up the skill which and
07:03 - the contacts and venture once you reach
07:06 - four years you have enough security
07:09 - for anyone anywhere in the world see
07:12 - three to four years like really hone
07:14 - down and then develop the skill yes okay
07:17 - now in that time are you saying they're
07:19 - not earning any of them know that you
07:21 - are an income but you are in a single
07:23 - trips oh I see what you're saying just
07:26 - don't say it tomorrow I'll quit and
07:28 - starts out I'm out of college tomorrow I
07:31 - want this on guys
07:33 - so you need to put in work either when
07:37 - you are in college put in the work and
07:38 - build up your get up is a beginner okay
07:45 - and whether they're going to college or
07:46 - not let's say they're not in college
07:48 - they want to start getting paid from
07:50 - coatings yep okay what should their
07:53 - process be like should they first spend
07:55 - four years like getting the skills down
07:57 - then try to apply or should they try to
07:59 - apply apply as early as three months or
08:02 - six months into the coding experience in
08:04 - interior coding experience he's once you
08:08 - have the skill to like fill a site or
08:10 - something which is like you can get in
08:12 - six month
08:12 - yeah or if you are going to those
08:13 - finishing schools and everything you can
08:15 - get there in six laughs yeah even our
08:17 - beer if yeah depending on once you get
08:22 - that immediately apply and get
08:26 - production experience all the projects
08:29 - and everything
08:30 - don't try to freelance maybe work
08:33 - something right get get the experience
08:36 - beautiful which which will help you to
08:38 - better your skill and habits
08:42 - why do you say don't feel at first why
08:44 - do you say get up job first one is the
08:47 - skill itself yeah thank you need you
08:49 - need production experiences to get get
08:53 - to a skill level where people are
08:55 - comfortable hiring you remote or
08:56 - freelance that's okay because people are
08:58 - not if you don't have you cannot learn
09:01 - why you are being what while you're
09:04 - freelancing yep you can learn while
09:07 - being removed but unique on the trust of
09:10 - the employer yeah so you will not get
09:13 - that trust of the employer if your name
09:15 - or deposits got it
09:17 - Terry say adios you should have enough
09:21 - body of work open sores have enough body
09:24 - of work to show sometimes that you can
09:26 - do the more I love that I love that you
09:30 - know lately I've been getting pretty
09:31 - creative with how I'm using Instagram
09:33 - and I'm getting my brother on it - he's
09:35 - a freelance colorist and I'm naturally I
09:37 - helped him with it and he's going it's
09:39 - going crazy on it so he's actually in
09:42 - the last he's running on trade on
09:44 - history over the last five days he's
09:46 - actually landed two of clients straight
09:49 - on Instagram more like these companies
09:51 - and they want to take their fur color do
09:54 - you think if somebody's sort of getting
09:55 - an item like that with coating and
09:58 - trying to get clients is that something
10:00 - with
10:01 - they could look down because I don't
10:02 - know you said up work and those are not
10:04 - that great and let's say somebody
10:06 - doesn't already have like four or five
10:07 - years of relationships been here from
10:09 - college what would be a creative way for
10:12 - them to start building these
10:13 - relationships sure so one way is if you
10:17 - if I take the example of you right you
10:20 - have built this whole channel and and
10:24 - you what are you selling you're selling
10:26 - or each movie yup right you can teach
10:29 - this once you learn you immediately so
10:32 - once that's your product you can start
10:34 - selling that community you can use
10:35 - leverage Instagram and
10:39 - to sell
10:41 - what are your teachings that's the
10:43 - easiest thing you can do
10:44 - I never did that yeah I wish I knew but
10:48 - now it's a really scale of yes it's very
10:51 - scalable
10:52 - if you can't product is something which
10:54 - you have learned yeah do that
10:55 - immediately what the programming
10:58 - languages primarily you guys so I do
11:02 - Ruby all the time okay I like Jace also
11:05 - but chase the last serious aside it
11:08 - wasn't to turn 11
11:09 - yeah when Jay with the CMAs completely
11:11 - different back then
11:13 - now I mean want to get back into it but
11:15 - maybe some current through review ever

11:22 - great now whatever we would love to I'll
11:24 - feature it personally tour yes as them
11:26 - by developer weekend
11:28 - that's great I would love that okay
11:30 - anything else you want to add before we
11:33 - wrap it up um anyway like maybe you want
11:38 - to give a takeaway or tips from anything
11:44 - that you feel you want to show sure so
11:46 - if you get to a stage where you feel you
11:48 - have the skill and the network don't be
11:52 - afraid to try traveling and programming
11:57 - it's fun yeah it's really really really
12:00 - fun if you can if you can actually don't
12:03 - be afraid that oh I'm gonna lose a job
