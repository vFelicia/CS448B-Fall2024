00:00 - hey guys how's it going this is Kazi
00:01 - from clever programmer Tom in this video
00:04 - I want to bust a myth nobody's a
00:08 - self-made man and I'm going to tell you
00:12 - exactly why that's the case so without
00:14 - any further ado let's jump right into it
00:17 - [Music]
00:26 - [Applause]
00:29 - yeah so basically this video I'm going
00:31 - to be covering okay why nobody is really
00:34 - self-made yeah so what the heck do I
00:37 - mean by that well everybody that pretty
00:39 - much gets anywhere gets there with the
00:42 - help of people and anybody that tells
00:44 - you otherwise is kind of feeding you
00:49 - some there and you need to kind
00:52 - of call them out on it
00:54 - you know nobody kind of just puts on war
00:56 - paint and it just gets going everybody
00:59 - needs help now for example with me
01:02 - starting chess when I started in the
01:05 - career of chess I had a team that's why
01:09 - I'm big on even in one of my videos I
01:11 - talked about unfair advantages you know
01:13 - be ethical like Grant Cardone says but
01:15 - be unfair meaning wake up early exercise
01:19 - you know you get these unfair advantages
01:22 - so whether in whatever career you're in
01:24 - you can get that extra boost and another
01:27 - one of these unfair advantages is
01:30 - understanding that really nobody is a
01:32 - self-made man so even when I say I'm
01:37 - self-taught computer programmer that's a
01:41 - load of BS because when I was starting
01:44 - out I learned from places like Udacity
01:46 - and EDX and Coursera and whatever other
01:49 - platforms are out there right online
01:51 - tutorials Stack Overflow YouTube all
01:56 - this stuff so I'm now really self-made
02:00 - it was with the help of all these other
02:02 - people when I started my career in chess
02:05 - right I became top 1% in the world in
02:08 - chess and I still am and this was not
02:11 - because I was just such a genius I
02:14 - barely knew how to play chess you know
02:17 - even when I was 14 and then around the
02:19 - age of 14 or 15 in my high school I just
02:22 - joined the chess team and then there
02:24 - were amazing players there that helped
02:27 - me along the way that pretty much became
02:30 - my mentors but one of the key things out
02:34 - there I had to do was understand that
02:36 - you don't just become it by yourself you
02:39 - have to be okay with asking for help so
02:42 - I had to allow these people to be my
02:45 - mentors right you have to allow people
02:47 - to mentor you because then your success
02:50 - is effectively their success because
02:53 - you're giving them the right to help you
02:56 - be successful and when you let other
02:58 - people be a part of your life they're
03:01 - kind of connected they're with you so
03:03 - when you become successful like yes you
03:06 - are successful but on the flip side if
03:09 - you are just being a completely evil
03:13 - person who's driven very selfishly to
03:15 - improve him or herself and not believe
03:19 - in other people and not let other people
03:20 - coach you then effectively what you're
03:23 - almost doing is you're almost against
03:25 - them right there's almost this rivalry
03:27 - like no you're not better I'm better
03:28 - than you even if there are years beyond
03:31 - your skill level then they don't they
03:34 - don't want you no they don't care if you
03:36 - succeed or not and that's going to slow
03:38 - your progress down that's going to limit
03:40 - that unfair advantage that you get in
03:43 - life so be open to letting people kind
03:47 - of mentor you and put you in the right
03:49 - direction you know like I'll give you
03:54 - I'll give you an example
03:55 - I read this book Rich Dad Poor Dad it's
03:58 - a phenomenal book if you haven't read it
04:01 - go freak and read this book it will
04:03 - change your life but it really opened up
04:05 - lots of things for me you know what's
04:08 - important is finding out what you don't
04:10 - know and a lot of the times when you're
04:12 - just specializing in something you'll
04:14 - almost always miss the things that you
04:17 - don't know so by going through this book
04:20 - and really open my mind and a few things
04:23 - clicked for me and I remember one of the
04:26 - times you know I was doing a job I was
04:28 - doing software consulting and I was
04:31 - making really good money but you know
04:34 - when my parents or my mom had to go to a
04:37 - hospital and the bill for one night is
04:39 - $30,000 how does somebody who is doing a
04:44 - job able to pay for something like that
04:47 - right and this was something that was
04:49 - happening
04:50 - pretty frequently and this was something
04:52 - that was happening where for my mom we
04:54 - couldn't even get her surgery because we
04:56 - didn't have enough money so that's not
05:00 - something that somebody who's doing a
05:02 - job can actually afford and do right I
05:05 - have to live my life and I have to make
05:08 - enough money so then later I could have
05:10 - a house and a safe future how do I take
05:12 - care of other people you know if there's
05:16 - barely enough for me
05:17 - so because I had read this book Rich Dad
05:20 - Poor Dad he said you know be open to
05:21 - asking for help
05:23 - you know because he asks his rich dad
05:25 - and poor dad in that book for help so
05:28 - literally one time one of these people I
05:31 - knew he is really rich and I literally
05:35 - asked him I'm like how do I get out of
05:38 - this cycle it was like 2:00 a.m. at
05:40 - night and I just woke up and I was like
05:41 - what the hell am i doing like I'm going
05:44 - to go on to live this mediocre life
05:47 - where I'm barely going to make enough
05:49 - for myself let alone four other people
05:51 - there are people in the world that are
05:52 - starving that I can't help there are
05:55 - people who you know would like to get an
05:58 - education but can't I wish I could help
06:00 - them there are people in my family that
06:03 - need help like physical help because
06:06 - they need to actually be hospitalised
06:07 - and I can't help them and I can barely
06:10 - make enough to help myself so I don't
06:12 - want to live a selfish life I think it's
06:14 - very selfish to just be like I just want
06:16 - to make enough for myself you know I
06:18 - think that's a very selfish way of
06:20 - living because you should have enough
06:22 - not just for yourself
06:23 - but support other people around you so
06:26 - again back to the story it was around
06:28 - 2:00 a.m. and I texted this person and I
06:30 - said you know I'm kind of sick of that
06:33 - and I don't want to be in that cycle
06:35 - what is it that I can do to break out of
06:38 - this cycle to make enough for my family
06:41 - to make enough for me to make enough for
06:43 - other people in my life or people even
06:46 - outside of my life that I could help and
06:48 - it's like 2:00 a.m. I remember texting
06:50 - this to him and just making myself so
06:52 - vulnerable and open out there and then
06:54 - you know and I was like oh you know
06:56 - why did I leave him this crazy message
07:00 - because he was a friend
07:01 - and it was just weird to leave yourself
07:04 - so vulnerable and open to somebody
07:06 - didn't feel natural you know because I'm
07:08 - not that type of person I always want to
07:10 - save my pride and ego and I'd rather not
07:14 - ask for help I'd rather just do it on my
07:16 - own
07:16 - so the weird experience doing that and I
07:18 - remember half an hour goes by and one
07:20 - hour goes by and I'm just getting the
07:21 - feeling in my in my gut like ah this is
07:24 - this doesn't feel good to put myself out
07:26 - there like that and then you know
07:29 - hour-and-a-half passes and I actually
07:31 - get a message back from him and it was
07:33 - literally one word and he says business
07:37 - and that was one of the life-defining
07:40 - one about life defining moments I've had
07:43 - in my life and it was that kind of like
07:45 - you rake a moment that mental switch and
07:49 - I was like wow okay so business will be
07:53 - one of those things that kind of helps
07:54 - you break out of it then I had to
07:56 - reverse engineer how I go about doing
07:58 - that and you know for that there was
08:01 - different kind of help so like for
08:02 - example for computer programming right I
08:04 - found programming Mentors
08:07 - and basically what I was doing without
08:10 - swapping my chess skill I don't think of
08:12 - money as just a static thing right you
08:13 - hoard it up and you save it up and then
08:16 - like you later 60 years from now you
08:18 - live a good life but you miss out on all
08:21 - your years I don't think I'm money like
08:23 - that I think of it as like a dynamic
08:24 - thing so meaning I didn't even think of
08:26 - money as money all I thought of it was
08:28 - like I'm gonna trade my chess skill for
08:30 - programming skill so if I made $70 one
08:34 - hour or hundred dollars and one hour
08:35 - $150 in one hour working and helping a
08:38 - client in chess
08:39 - oh then use that money for one or two or
08:42 - three hours of a programmers time to
08:45 - then get the programming skill and then
08:48 - once I realize business was something
08:50 - that was very important I then had to
08:53 - get a mentor in business as well so you
08:57 - know having a programming mentor having
08:59 - a business mentor those were the things
09:01 - that allowed my programming career to
09:04 - become successful and then my business
09:06 - that clever programmer to become
09:07 - successful so what I want you to take
09:10 - away from this video is you don't have
09:12 - to start paying people if you don't have
09:14 - the money right now
09:15 - but what I want you to start doing is
09:18 - then go out in communities where they're
09:20 - like-minded people
09:22 - right there's meetup comm but if you're
09:24 - in another country and maybe meetup
09:26 - commas anything like go out to where
09:29 - these people meet up maybe they meet up
09:32 - in some city nearby you you know there's
09:35 - a event going on or a convention or if
09:38 - there's nothing going on you know try to
09:40 - travel to a different city or if you can
09:44 - afford it a different country but try to
09:46 - meet with these like-minded people and
09:48 - if none of those options are feasible
09:51 - for you try to find these people online
09:53 - right these communities exist you can
09:55 - find a friend online that you can chat
09:57 - with and then if you guys connect then
10:00 - you can actually start doing Skype
10:02 - sessions or FaceTime sessions and those
10:05 - don't really cost you that much go girl
10:07 - hang out and then you guys can connect
10:09 - with each other
10:09 - so find somebody who is ahead of you but
10:12 - understand that you have to make
10:14 - yourself open to receiving help ego will
10:18 - hurt you your pride will be the death of
10:20 - you let those things go when you see
10:23 - people who are successful it's easy to
10:26 - get there you just have to model what
10:28 - they did ask for help because when you
10:31 - ask for help then your success is tied
10:34 - with their success and they want to see
10:35 - you become successful hopefully this
10:38 - video makes sense if you have any
10:40 - questions or something wasn't clear
10:41 - please put it down in the comments below
10:43 - I'll answer them for you guys other than
10:45 - that this is it for this video thank you
10:48 - guys so much for watching as always I
10:49 - love you so much I'll see you in the
10:52 - next video
