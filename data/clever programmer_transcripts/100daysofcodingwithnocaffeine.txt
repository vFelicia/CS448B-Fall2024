00:00 - what's up guys how's it going this is
00:01 - qazi from cleverprogrammer.com i just
00:04 - want to talk to you about my experience
00:06 - with coding with no coffee for over 100
00:09 - days my perspective what have i learned
00:11 - from it so far should you try it are
00:13 - there any myths something crazy that
00:15 - happens with that said smash the like
00:17 - button hit the subscribe button as well
00:19 - let's get into it actually alex becker
00:21 - was one of the reasons why i stopped
00:22 - drinking coffee so i watched one of his
00:24 - videos him talking about caffeine and
00:27 - how it was affecting him and how it was
00:29 - screwing up his productivity and how it
00:31 - gave him you know a little bit of a
00:32 - boost and then crashed so i thought if
00:34 - alex becker says this is a good idea i'm
00:36 - gonna give it a try so i got on this
00:38 - journey and ever since that day i kind
00:40 - of stopped drinking coffee
00:48 - i wanted to see how not drinking coffee
00:50 - would affect my coding skills or how i
00:53 - focused and my ability to sustain focus
00:56 - over a prolonged period of time this is
00:58 - one thing that people ask me like how do
01:00 - you feel now what does it feel like and
01:02 - i always think that they're expecting
01:04 - something like oh my god literally holy
01:07 - spirit now just floats above the sky
01:10 - just sits on top of a mountain just like
01:12 - shits out wisdom i've been going on for
01:14 - over 100 days and honestly unfortunately
01:16 - it's not like that i if i told you the
01:19 - truth i feel no different at all than i
01:23 - did a hundred days ago the peak that i
01:26 - hit once i have my coffee i just don't
01:28 - have those anymore maybe i'm not that
01:30 - observant but i can't remember if i
01:32 - really had crashes but maybe sometimes i
01:34 - feel like when i had the coffee after i
01:36 - drank the coffee or whatever i probably
01:38 - might have had those like crashes that
01:40 - come after caffeine like post caffeine
01:42 - now i don't feel those anymore and
01:45 - probably my energy just feels like it's
01:47 - sustained over a longer period of time
01:49 - in terms of how it's affected my coding
01:51 - again same way while i don't have those
01:53 - crazy peaks of energy
01:55 - as i would with caffeine i don't also
01:58 - have those like crashes so that's been
02:00 - good but for me what i've realized what
02:03 - really helps me actually staying fasted
02:05 - so if i don't eat that much then i
02:06 - actually focus more and get more and
02:08 - more dialed in
02:13 - so in terms of my coding i don't see
02:15 - that much of a difference with or
02:17 - without caffeine i think i can sustain
02:19 - my focus for maybe a longer period of
02:21 - time
02:22 - my recent coding hours were 12 p.m to 10
02:25 - p.m so like 10 hours of coding or more
02:27 - per day but yeah with that said for me
02:30 - those are honestly the results of the
02:31 - caffeine i have maybe longer periods of
02:34 - focus what i do is i don't have to rely
02:36 - on anything not taking caffeine has been
02:39 - empowering i will tell you that because
02:41 - i feel that i don't need anything to
02:43 - sustain and consistently be going at the
02:45 - pace that i'm going at to be productive
02:47 - or high achieving or you know hit really
02:50 - hard goals and don't need to take
02:52 - caffeine in order to be able to do this
02:54 - that feeling is priceless i will tell
02:56 - you that my hack is for me coffee wasn't
02:59 - about the hit that it gave me coffee for
03:01 - me was a lot more the ritual the
03:03 - ceremony of the coffee itself like
03:05 - holding it and watching the smoke come
03:07 - out of it and coming and having a coffee
03:10 - break in between my coding sessions
03:11 - you're holding it you bring it up you're
03:13 - just looking at it the sound the smell
03:16 - the taste all of that was what i was
03:18 - addicted to it wasn't just the coffee
03:19 - itself so i thought okay what can i
03:21 - replace it with and the tea gives me a
03:23 - very similar experience honestly some
03:25 - kind of herbal tea i've literally
03:26 - stopped taking any caffeine i take
03:28 - nothing with caffeine in it so no energy
03:30 - drinks nothing that biochemically
03:32 - changes me because one thing i do agree
03:35 - with is at the end of the day it is a
03:37 - drug it is a stimulant that is going
03:39 - inside of your body and changing things
03:41 - about it and that is something i don't
03:44 - want other benefits i'll tell you of not
03:46 - having caffeine for example if i don't
03:48 - have caffeine and i'm tired
03:50 - throughout the day that's a goddamn good
03:52 - sign you know why because i'm
03:54 - tired it means i had a lack of sleep so
03:57 - it will expose that i'm sleeping less
04:00 - whereas having caffeine will mask it and
04:03 - masking a sleep deprivation is one of
04:05 - the worst things you can do in
04:07 - your life as anything as a developer as
04:09 - a human being and you will have
04:11 - extremely damaging repercussions over an
04:14 - extended period of time it is
04:16 - destructive what it will do to your life
04:18 - and your happiness and your mental
04:20 - health and your emotional sanity every
04:23 - single one of those areas in a very
04:25 - detrimental way it's kind of like if
04:27 - you're recording and all of a sudden
04:28 - your terminal stops telling you that
04:30 - there are any errors and you're like
04:31 - this is great this is perfect it doesn't
04:33 - tell me any errors anymore when you run
04:34 - your app it doesn't run but it never
04:36 - also tells you an error that's what
04:38 - caffeine does it just hides it and goes
04:39 - yeah don't worry about it there are no
04:41 - errors but it's also not working and
04:42 - it's not telling you why it's not
04:44 - working and so
04:45 - hiding the errors is not a good thing
04:47 - errors and coding are your friend look
04:49 - at the stack and you trace it back and
04:51 - you go boom this is a problem this is
04:53 - exactly what's happening if you don't
04:55 - have that you're screwed same thing with
04:58 - caffeine catching things takes an
04:59 - extremely long amount of time and then
05:01 - when you're older it's such a habit and
05:03 - it's going to be so much harder to
05:05 - remove and so what i recommend is if
05:08 - you're listening to this really it
05:09 - sounds cool give it a try you might not
05:10 - need to do a hundred days try 20 days or
05:12 - just try 30 days try replacing it with
05:15 - the herbal tea where there's no caffeine
05:17 - try going without caffeine in your body
05:20 - and see what that feels like over the
05:21 - next 20 or 30 days but one thing i can
05:23 - tell you and i can promise you is you're
05:25 - going to feel a lot more empowered
05:27 - you're gonna feel like man i don't
05:29 - really depend on it and i don't need it
05:31 - to succeed and do things and i think
05:32 - those feelings are gonna be pretty
05:34 - freeing and i think after not having
05:36 - caffeine you start finding yourself more
05:38 - and more tired you might be like screw
05:40 - this i'm going to take caffeine but i
05:42 - challenge you look at your sleep you're
05:44 - probably not sleeping the right amount
05:46 - you're probably not resting how much you
05:49 - should and again all of this is going to
05:51 - affect the ability of you coding and how
05:54 - long you're able to code at the end of
05:56 - the day the best developers are going to
05:58 - be the ones that can sustain focus on a
06:01 - problem for a long period of time and
06:03 - not have to crash and if you can keep
06:04 - doing that with caffeine for the first
06:06 - couple of years that's great but what
06:07 - about long term if this is a career
06:09 - you're trying to stick to you want to
06:10 - develop your focusing muscles to grow
06:13 - stronger and not aided by additional
06:16 - stimulants so that's just my thought i
06:18 - have no judgment do whatever you want i
06:20 - might go back to coffee at some point
06:22 - give me your one takeaway you got from
06:23 - this video i love your face this is your
06:25 - boy cozzy and as always i'll see you
06:29 - in the next video
06:31 - peace
06:36 - you
