00:00 - Python frameworks so there are two big
00:02 - frameworks Jango and flask like I've
00:04 - mentioned cure my recommendations flask
00:08 - is pretty simple but the problem is that
00:12 - okay let's just talk about quickly what
00:15 - a framework is so if you were to do web
00:17 - development Python you would have to
00:20 - pull out your hair
00:21 - not because of Python Python is awesome
00:23 - but because web development you'd have
00:25 - to write all your own code but if you
00:27 - use a framework with Python like flask
00:31 - the benefit of that is that it does all
00:36 - the big heavy lifting for you that you
00:38 - don't have to worry about anymore so
00:40 - creating servers and making things go
00:42 - online on a website
00:44 - okay make other people be able to see
00:46 - your website it's super easy you can do
00:49 - it with just a few lines of code flask
00:51 - is super light weight again as I'm
00:55 - talking write these things down flask is
00:58 - pretty lightweight and it's cool but the
01:01 - problem is because it's too lightweight
01:02 - sometimes it's you have to write a lot
01:04 - of code to make things work whereas
01:07 - Django is a little bit more advanced
01:10 - looking and can be confusing sometimes
01:12 - but it's what we call batteries included
01:16 - and it comes with a lot of libraries a
01:18 - lot of big things juicy meaty things
01:22 - built in there so think of it like bunch
01:25 - of developers who gave up and had
01:28 - sleepless nights God probably divorces
01:32 - because it works so hard and like got
01:34 - huge eye bags writing all this code and
01:37 - creating this amazing thing for you and
01:39 - now you could just steal it with just a
01:41 - few lines of code and use it okay so
01:44 - think of it think of Django like that
01:46 - and you could build things pretty
01:48 - quickly
01:49 - okay so web development django
01:51 - developers make about a hundred and ten
01:53 - thousand dollars a year jingle is my
01:55 - more preferred framework it's a little
01:57 - bit advanced but if it's taught to you
01:59 - the right way you can pick it up fast
02:02 - and then you don't have to look back
02:04 - django is my preferred way to go write
02:07 - that down
02:08 - second best text editors or coding
02:12 - editors for pi
02:13 - so there are a lot of them there is
02:15 - sublime text there is at hum and then
02:18 - there is pycharm sublime text and atom
02:22 - you can use interchangeably sublime text
02:26 - that annoying thing is it keeps asking
02:27 - for purchase whereas atom is completely
02:29 - free so you guys can just download atom
02:32 - to write your code in pie chart is my
02:36 - personal favorite IDE or let's just
02:39 - simplify and say coding editor it's my
02:41 - favorite but I would recommend you guys
02:43 - to get into PyCharm around the second or
02:46 - third month mark of your coding because
02:48 - it is a little bit more technical and it
02:51 - is a little bit more advanced and in the
02:53 - start it might confuse you more than it
02:55 - helps you because of how big it is but
02:57 - again is just a few practical things you
03:00 - need to know and then boom boom boom
03:01 - you're all caught up alright so for
03:04 - someone who wants to enter into web dev
03:07 - what would you advise them Jango seems
03:09 - challenging with their setups and admin
03:13 - Django is honestly pretty simple to get
03:17 - started with just the starting part is
03:20 - sometimes tricky but once you get past a
03:23 - little bit of starting time it's pretty
03:25 - easy to build things up really fast with
03:27 - Django so again I'm a huge fan of Django
03:30 - but if you have extra time in your life
03:33 - learn a little bit of flask maybe spend
03:36 - a week learning flask and that will show
03:40 - you the things you need to be doing with
03:42 - web development and how you're doing
03:45 - them because you're gonna be writing
03:46 - each line of code yourself you'll get a
03:48 - good grasp of what the heck is going on
03:50 - and then when you do them in Django
03:52 - you'll just be like oh it's just like
03:53 - this thing I did in Flast except it's
03:55 - easier now and it won't confuse you okay
03:57 - so that's really it
