00:00 - you're too focused on results
00:03 - that's one of the biggest problems I see
00:05 - happen with people who are learning to
00:07 - code you're constantly
00:10 - looking for that job you're constantly
00:12 - hoping and dreaming when will you land
00:15 - that job and when will this misery of
00:18 - coding learning JavaScript learning
00:20 - react
00:21 - will be over
00:25 - this is a sure guaranteed way to make
00:30 - your life miserable
00:32 - your journey feel about 10 to 15 times
00:35 - as long and for you to not feel
00:38 - essentially any ounce of happiness
00:43 - avoid this it's a trap it's a pitfall a
00:47 - lot of people fall for this
00:51 - Andrew huberman
00:53 - he's a PhD a scientist
00:56 - and he researches at Harvard University
00:59 - I believe and he researches dopamine and
01:01 - how that works and functions inside of
01:03 - our brain
01:04 - one of the things he talks about
01:07 - is when you become too focused on the
01:10 - outcome rather than the thing that
01:12 - you're actually focused on so let's say
01:13 - you're constantly focusing on the reward
01:16 - that you're gonna get from coding which
01:18 - is you're going to get a job one day
01:21 - if that's all your primary focus
01:25 - it's crazy but dopamine actually
01:27 - controls your perception of time
01:30 - so what that means is when you're
01:33 - constantly focusing on the reward
01:35 - it extends out your time your perception
01:38 - of time actually becomes incredibly long
01:40 - because you're constantly thinking about
01:42 - when this thing will end and you get
01:44 - your dopamine hit and that excitement
01:46 - that you want to experience at the end
01:48 - not during the process you feel the
01:50 - excitement the happiness The Joy the
01:52 - dopamine hit once it's done so for
01:55 - example if you had a three month long
01:57 - coding Journey or a six month long or a
01:59 - nine month long coding journey to get
02:00 - your first job you would experience your
02:03 - first dopamine hit at the ninth month
02:05 - Mark when you would get your job
02:08 - now compare that to somebody else say
02:10 - you're up against somebody like me
02:12 - whoever it is coding loving it feels
02:16 - like it's a video game feels like it's
02:18 - illegal that clients should be paying
02:20 - him the day that he gets a job
02:23 - I'm having the time of my life
02:26 - and I'm getting dopamine after dopamine
02:28 - hit every single line of code that I
02:31 - write every time I'm thinking about an
02:32 - idea every time I'm trying to express a
02:35 - thought
02:37 - and bring it to life
02:40 - and I'm constantly getting those
02:41 - dopamine hits I'm constantly excited I'm
02:44 - constantly happy
02:46 - when I get my first job in nine months
02:48 - to me it feels like time hasn't even
02:49 - passed it feels like time flew by
02:52 - for you it feels like an eternity has
02:54 - taken place
02:57 - so that's a very simple concept that it
02:59 - should explain to you that dopamine
03:00 - actually controls our perception of time
03:02 - now imagine you're doing something you
03:04 - really enjoy something you really really
03:06 - enjoy what happens to the time you look
03:08 - at the clock man five hours have just
03:10 - flown by you look at the clock again
03:12 - eight hours have flown by what is going
03:14 - on time's flying it can't stop
03:16 - think about something you really hate
03:19 - you're at the DMV getting your license
03:21 - registration or if you're International
03:23 - and somewhere else in the world you know
03:24 - whatever your equivalent is to driver's
03:26 - license or some kind of government thing
03:28 - where you're waiting for hours and hours
03:30 - and hours imagine like a flight you're
03:32 - waiting for the flight
03:34 - you know you waited a long time you know
03:37 - that it took a long time why because
03:39 - you're not getting any dopamine hits
03:41 - throughout the process
03:42 - and so the perception of your time is
03:45 - actually incredibly long
03:48 - uh this reminds me of story which was I
03:51 - went to my religious school for four
03:53 - years from the age of nine to about 12
03:55 - years old
03:57 - and every single day I would get there
04:03 - you know I I'm a
04:05 - little kid right now I'm nine years old
04:08 - really scrawny tiny in Chicago brutal
04:11 - winner
04:12 - sir you come inside the school the
04:14 - religious school
04:16 - it was called the madrasa
04:18 - and um I would come there
04:22 - and I'm freezing right
04:25 - the teacher comes up to me he goes did
04:27 - you memorize the homework and you know I
04:29 - memorized about like maybe one page but
04:31 - not the two pages that I was assigned
04:35 - he goes okay
04:36 - lift up your uh pants so like basically
04:39 - uh reveal your pants all the way up to
04:42 - your shin so like pull it pull up your
04:44 - pants up to your knees or whatever right
04:46 - so your shins are visible so make sure
04:48 - the Shins are visible
04:50 - and then he would go to the bathroom
04:52 - take out a plunger take the red uh head
04:56 - of the plunger off you know the plunger
04:58 - using the toilet he would take that off
05:01 - I'm gonna be this you'd be left with
05:03 - this thick wooden stick
05:06 - and he would just take that and whack it
05:09 - and smash it against your shins
05:11 - and he would just hit you over and over
05:13 - again
05:15 - it would
05:16 - uh my my shins would get so bruised up
05:19 - and I would feel like my my shins are
05:21 - going to break
05:23 - I know and it
05:24 - and a wooden stick hurts especially
05:27 - harder when you've just come from cold
05:29 - so when your hands are actually very
05:31 - very cold from like negative 10 degrees
05:33 - or negative five degrees you know the
05:35 - Chicago winter feels like negative 20
05:37 - negative 30.
05:38 - when you get hit it hurts like crazy
05:43 - it has a
05:46 - real real sting to it a very crazy sting
05:50 - to it and it'll burn you it'll stay
05:52 - there for a while
05:55 - and that would happen and that was just
05:57 - like just when I got in maybe at seven
06:00 - or eight a.m to enter the religious
06:01 - school
06:02 - and I'm hurting and I'm like my body's
06:04 - destroyed then throughout the day you'd
06:07 - be punished over and over and over again
06:09 - lots of crazy punishments okay become a
06:11 - chicken uh go down bring your hands
06:15 - through your legs hold on to your ears
06:16 - and then
06:17 - you know recite and read
06:21 - um
06:22 - extremely loudly to the max of your
06:25 - volume so you would be reading and
06:27 - reciting so loudly for hours on end that
06:30 - your veins would be like popping you
06:32 - know out of your out of your neck
06:37 - and I would be doing that and I'd be in
06:39 - so much pain and Agony and I would have
06:41 - felt like
06:42 - maybe 30 hours have gone by like 20
06:45 - hours have gone by and I would look at
06:47 - the time look at the clock and it'd be
06:48 - one or two pm
06:50 - and I'd be like [ __ ]
06:53 - I have
06:55 - a whole more day to go of this
06:58 - and this and that day would go on and
07:01 - that day would last until and you know
07:03 - there are a lot of other crazy things
07:05 - that you know
07:07 - um
07:08 - I don't feel totally comfortable sharing
07:11 - but like
07:12 - everybody even in that school was crazy
07:15 - you know even the adult kids would like
07:17 - beat you up bully you everybody's
07:19 - bullying each other
07:21 - and you know so it was crazy but the
07:23 - time would go so slowly and we would be
07:26 - there until 8 00 p.m 9 00 p.m at a time
07:29 - so get there at 8 A.M sometimes be there
07:31 - 8 P.M 9 P.M
07:34 - long incredibly long days
07:38 - and I remember every time I would be
07:40 - leaving there I'd just be sitting there
07:41 - thinking
07:42 - man
07:44 - like is this ever gonna end is this what
07:47 - my life is going to be like for the rest
07:49 - of my life
07:50 - and I just remember always thinking this
07:52 - feels like I'm in hell
07:54 - and this feels like I'm in prison and it
07:57 - feels like it's never gonna end at the
07:59 - end of the day I would I would be
08:00 - laughing at my friends and I would be
08:01 - talking I'm like dude this feels like
08:03 - prison like this is never gonna end bro
08:05 - like this [ __ ] is wild
08:10 - and it was when that was just one day
08:12 - right then you'd go again four more days
08:14 - of that week and then every week again
08:17 - and again and again and again and again
08:18 - for month weeks and months and months
08:20 - months months months and to turn into
08:22 - years
08:23 - three four years
08:25 - how those four years felt like it felt
08:29 - like it was about
08:30 - 12 15 years and I always jokingly say
08:33 - this but I I kind of mean it that it
08:36 - felt like I did time I did prison time
08:38 - for four years it felt miserable
08:42 - but what I learned really well from that
08:46 - I mean I gotta I I don't want you guys
08:48 - to think of it like as some I'm trying
08:50 - to tell you like a victim story feels
08:52 - sad for me
08:53 - I actually developed a lot of resilience
08:55 - in my life every day I wake up and I
08:57 - don't get the [ __ ] beaten out of me is
08:59 - an amazing day for me whereas somebody
09:01 - else wakes up and they've crushed it and
09:03 - they wake up sad I feel sad for them
09:06 - my self-esteem because of that you know
09:09 - not that it it has gotten lower but I
09:12 - just feel like I don't deserve anything
09:14 - and every day like I'm supposed to be
09:15 - that kid who gets beat up and if I just
09:17 - don't get beat up I'm happy as [ __ ]
09:22 - turn into my strength
09:23 - but the reason I'm sharing this with you
09:25 - is dopamine is a very powerful receptor
09:28 - and and controller of time it controls
09:30 - your perception of time so
09:33 - if you have gone through that experience
09:36 - you know or something similar I know you
09:38 - guys have had you're probably really
09:40 - tough upbringings too and everybody goes
09:42 - through problems in their own way in
09:43 - their own childhood
09:45 - with your parents and you know
09:47 - um maybe you had something what I think
09:49 - is even worse like your parents putting
09:51 - a lot of pressure on you my parents
09:54 - kind of put pressure on me but not
09:55 - really that much plus I was a black
09:56 - sheep and never really cared and just
09:58 - did my own thing but I know a ton of
10:00 - people
10:00 - and I know I have a big Indian audience
10:03 - and a lot of you guys your parents are
10:05 - crazy your parents are like really
10:07 - strict right I'm Pakistani and my
10:09 - parents were super strict
10:11 - so that is so that could that that can
10:14 - be psychologically very demanding and
10:17 - very excruciating and it teaches you to
10:19 - live life in a way where Everything
10:21 - feels like an obligation you don't
10:22 - necessarily know how to do things for
10:24 - fun you're almost like this prisoner
10:26 - with suffering from PTSD and going
10:28 - through life like you can barely smile
10:31 - you just do things because you're meant
10:32 - to do them because somebody told you to
10:34 - do them you're just trying to achieve
10:36 - something so you can prove something to
10:37 - somebody
10:39 - and it creates a really [ __ ] up warped
10:42 - reality
10:43 - why this is important and why I'm
10:45 - talking less about coding right now and
10:48 - this is because I'm realizing these are
10:50 - the real problems people are suffering
10:52 - from
10:53 - these are the real issues that are
10:55 - actually stopping you from learning
10:57 - becoming better as a software developer
10:59 - coding because you have all this baggage
11:03 - that you actually bring
11:05 - but back to my point of dopamine
11:08 - if you don't learn how to enjoy the
11:12 - process
11:14 - things are going to feel like an
11:16 - eternity for you how how my religious
11:18 - schools fell for me felt for me felt
11:21 - like an eternity for you trying to get a
11:24 - coding job
11:26 - will feel like an excruciating pain how
11:30 - my religious school felt like prison
11:32 - time it will feel like prison time to
11:35 - you
11:36 - so a few amazing things that I picked up
11:38 - from the religious schools one I became
11:40 - incredibly resilient in my life two
11:43 - I made a decision
11:45 - if I don't enjoy something
11:48 - I mean there's discipline in everything
11:50 - so there's there's that too but like if
11:52 - I'm not enjoying the thing that I'm
11:54 - gonna do in life I just have no
11:56 - tolerance for it if I don't believe in
11:57 - it and if I don't enjoy it I don't know
11:59 - why I'm doing it I have zero tolerance
12:03 - for that thing
12:08 - I think for you it's important to know
12:10 - why you're doing something understand
12:12 - why you're doing something because you
12:14 - can like
12:15 - I'll be specific in my religious school
12:17 - I was supposed to memorize Quran okay so
12:21 - think about this I'm memorizing in a
12:22 - language I don't actually understand
12:25 - they never taught me the language
12:28 - so imagine memorizing something for four
12:31 - years
12:32 - without knowing what it means now I'm
12:35 - not saying all religion is like this
12:37 - there are places where they'll teach it
12:38 - to you in a beautiful way where you'll
12:39 - learn the meaning behind it and
12:40 - everything that was in our school we
12:42 - just memorized it
12:44 - now think about how nonsensical that is
12:46 - because
12:48 - there's hard drives
12:50 - there are there are like
12:52 - you know Google cloud and Dropbox and
12:56 - everything on the planet that could
12:58 - store materials you don't actually need
13:00 - to physically with your head memorize
13:02 - stuff and keep it right because idea is
13:05 - if everybody forgets well then the
13:06 - people who have had have it in their
13:07 - head will remember but like now you have
13:09 - machines now you have computers you
13:11 - could store it there the more important
13:12 - thing would have been to teach me the
13:14 - language Arabic to actually make me
13:16 - understand what this book says I have no
13:18 - idea what the book says
13:21 - the reason why I'm going so far into my
13:23 - own personal life is I want to draw out
13:25 - these analogies for you because a lot of
13:28 - you are spending time coding but not
13:30 - going deep into it you have no idea what
13:32 - you're even doing
13:33 - you're just going through tutorials and
13:35 - you have no understanding of what it is
13:37 - that you're actually doing because you
13:39 - don't enjoy it because every time you're
13:41 - doing it it's almost like you're in pain
13:43 - until you get that job if you're in pain
13:46 - guess what's going to happen
13:48 - you're not going to take the extra time
13:49 - to learn what that thing means you're
13:51 - just going to take the time to be done
13:53 - with your pain
13:54 - that two-hour session is going to feel
13:56 - like brutal amounts of work
13:59 - my message to you is find the joy and
14:03 - the process of learning to become a
14:04 - software developer learning to code
14:06 - please find the joy enjoy that process
14:10 - because it's beautiful man like coding
14:12 - is amazing you're getting to speak to
14:15 - this powerful Genie
14:18 - you can tell it what to do and it'll do
14:20 - it you just have to learn to speak its
14:21 - language
14:23 - you can take all the thoughts that you
14:25 - have in your head bring them to life
14:29 - I mean it's just so cool
14:33 - it feels like you're playing a video
14:34 - game it's very creative
14:38 - and there are people that are going to
14:40 - pay you for that I mean
14:42 - that's nuts to me that thought is kind
14:45 - of ridiculous
14:47 - or you might realize it's just not for
14:49 - you at which point I congratulate you
14:51 - because in life there are two things
14:53 - that are extremely important what to do
14:56 - and I think the thing that's even more
14:58 - important than that is what not to do
15:00 - there are only two things what to do
15:02 - what not to do
15:04 - what not to do I would argue is even
15:06 - more important for example I learned in
15:08 - my life
15:09 - I hated Information Technology I.T stuff
15:12 - subnet masking
15:14 - computer networking I hated that stuff
15:17 - it was garbage for me garbage hated it
15:21 - I decided what not to do put it on my
15:23 - not to-do list help me out tremendously
15:25 - in life
15:27 - I also learned that if I put my hand on
15:31 - something incredibly hot it'll burn the
15:33 - [ __ ] out of me
15:34 - my hand burned at some point when I was
15:36 - actually young that was a terrible
15:38 - experience
15:40 - and I learned
15:41 - wait
15:42 - let me put touching a fire in my not
15:45 - to-do list
15:47 - let me also put
15:49 - falling off of really high heights in my
15:52 - not to-do list so my not to do list
15:55 - actually gets me to survive every single
15:57 - day and move forward in the you know hey
16:00 - don't eat this food it'll make you fat
16:01 - and disease written
16:04 - hey don't do these activities like
16:06 - drinking at night because you're
16:07 - actually just poisoning yourself that's
16:09 - all that alcohol does you're actually
16:11 - because you can't develop social skills
16:15 - and you lack social skills
16:17 - you're just drowning yourself in this
16:19 - liquid that poisons your liver every day
16:24 - because that's your coping mechanism hey
16:26 - you don't need to drink coffee the only
16:28 - reason you're drinking coffee is because
16:30 - you're masking the fact you're not
16:31 - sleeping properly and that your
16:33 - nutrition is messed up that's why
16:35 - actually feeling tired so coffee is in
16:38 - my not to-do list alcohol is in my not
16:41 - to-do list Touching Fire is in my not
16:44 - to-do list
16:46 - it's very important when I felt abuse
16:49 - and I felt the pain of people who were
16:51 - narcissistic and who would physically
16:53 - beat you and emotionally and mentally
16:55 - beat you
16:56 - I put narcissistic behavior in my not
16:58 - to-do list so now my relationships in
17:01 - life are better so not to do is actually
17:03 - very important
17:05 - so if you decide that computer
17:07 - programming is in your not to do list I
17:10 - congratulate you I salute you you've
17:12 - actually made tremendous amount of
17:13 - progress
17:15 - and that opens you up to whole world of
17:18 - discovering other things because there's
17:20 - so much to life
17:22 - besides just coding
17:24 - so your not to-do list is incredibly
17:26 - important become friends with it don't
17:28 - fight it okay
17:31 - bring discipline and work ethic to
17:35 - things that are really valuable and
17:37 - meaningful don't bring discipline and
17:39 - work ethic to things that don't make
17:41 - sense like me just memorizing a book
17:43 - without understanding any of its meaning
17:46 - bring meaning to things that are
17:48 - supposed to have meaning okay bring
17:51 - discipline to the things that deserve
17:54 - you having that deserve you bringing
17:56 - discipline into them okay that's my
17:58 - message to you
18:00 - do that for your own life
18:03 - I hope that you enjoy coding and I hope
18:05 - that you fall in love with it but if you
18:07 - don't then also understand that it might
18:09 - just not be a thing for you okay so
18:12 - don't just force yourself to do it
18:14 - but if you're gonna do it and you've
18:16 - committed to doing it then find joy in
18:19 - it find the process fun like even when
18:21 - I'm doing my multi training it's brutal
18:24 - brutal training and most of the times
18:26 - when I'm doing it
18:29 - I apologize I have a meeting in one
18:31 - minute so I'll wrap up this video but if
18:34 - you're in if even in Muay Thai when the
18:36 - workout is brutal I keep telling myself
18:38 - I'm enjoying it and Andrew huberman you
18:41 - guys should listen to his podcast on
18:42 - dopamine and how it controls your
18:44 - motivation is incredible
18:48 - he talks about if you you and you you
18:50 - can control it if you keep telling
18:52 - yourself that you're actually enjoying
18:53 - it you chose to be there for Muay Thai I
18:56 - chose to be there I'm choosing to go
18:58 - through this pain you start enjoying it
19:00 - so now I'm actually start looking
19:01 - forward to Muay Thai now I'm looking

19:05 - give myself is a reward of the pain and
19:07 - the suffering that I actually experience

19:12 - once I get a six pack once I become a
19:15 - fighter and knock somebody out I'm gonna
19:17 - give myself the reward during the hard
19:19 - works for coding reward yourself
