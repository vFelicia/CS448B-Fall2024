00:00 - building an AI software to 10K a month
00:03 - day two so the copyrighting app we kept
00:05 - trying to build was failing miserably
00:07 - and we realized that these llm models
00:09 - like ttpt are just not good at writing
00:11 - copy so we decided to make it simpler
00:13 - and Niche down on podcasters where we
00:16 - take one podcast and turn it into
00:17 - multiple pieces of content how hard can
00:20 - it be so this narrowed the scope of the
00:22 - problem significantly and I thought we
00:23 - were going to have a V1 in like 20
00:25 - minutes except of course we didn't so at
00:28 - this point we decided to take undeserved
00:30 - coffee break and hung out with our
00:32 - friend Abdullah who honestly might be
00:34 - interested in building this sass out
00:35 - with us at this point we had more
00:37 - questions than answers like which model
00:38 - should we choose claw 3 mistol 7B Chad
00:41 - P4 turbo is this even going to make
00:43 - money should we just quit and never do
00:45 - this again oh and by the way if you
00:47 - haven't met us this is my co-founder Nas
00:49 - and that's me in the back being an idiot
00:50 - and here is US losing our minds after
00:52 - doing 10 hours of work with zero hours
00:54 - of progress we're professional upstair
00:56 - neighbors get number 18
