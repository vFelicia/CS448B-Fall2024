00:00 - [Music]
00:01 - what is up guys this is Kazi from clever
00:04 - programmer calm in this video I want to
00:05 - talk about why the YouTube algorithm is
00:07 - killing my channel why it's killing most
00:10 - of their channels and what it actually
00:12 - incentivizes this is Erin Burnett guys
00:15 - and we're gonna be talking in this video
00:18 - so let's kind of jump right into it okay
00:23 - so let me explain it to you guys on what
00:26 - is happening on all of this on our
00:30 - channels right so take a look at this
00:32 - the YouTube algorithm is taking output
00:37 - and channel down and this is happening
00:39 - live
00:39 - we have 370 1000 subscribers let me turn
00:44 - the volume just a little bit lower might
00:46 - be too loud we have three or sending
00:48 - 1000 subscribers with 13 million views
00:49 - right so how come our average daily
00:52 - subscribers were 400 okay yeah every day
00:55 - we had about 3 to 400 subscribers yes
00:58 - and you lay there have three and now all
01:01 - of a sudden we had yesterday seven and
01:03 - three even though we livestream 50 and
01:06 - 132 and we've just been consistently
01:08 - going down now I get it some of you
01:11 - might be like hey but maybe what's
01:13 - happening is that you're not producing a
01:15 - lot of content and that's that's good
01:18 - but you know we've been producing con
01:20 - content probably the most consistently
01:22 - we've ever been yeah you know like video
01:24 - is cued up premiere and waiting to get
01:26 - some nails everything everything's ready
01:28 - to go and it's still choking up right
01:31 - it's still choking us and it's just
01:33 - taking us down and there's very little
01:35 - that we find that we can actually do
01:37 - about it and so yeah so we want to show
01:43 - you we're loving your support and oh by
01:46 - the way guys your support has really
01:47 - been helping us I'm gonna pull up some
01:49 - of the comments from yesterday so here
01:53 - we go
01:55 - okay so Joshua silver yesterday and left
01:57 - the comedies like lucky for you your ads
01:59 - have been popping up on random videos
02:01 - that I watched so for a lack of a better
02:03 - word don't worry I believe your increase
02:05 - is coming if it wasn't for you I
02:07 - wouldn't have been accepted into my
02:09 - local community college this week in
02:10 - fact I got into
02:11 - letter on my bed at home today so
02:15 - awesome Joshua that's amazing
02:17 - and this is the reason why we want to
02:19 - survive as a channel because we believe
02:21 - that when we have to share what the
02:23 - world is valuable and maybe it can help
02:25 - a person or - yeah or 100 or 100 or more
02:29 - that's really our goal but like real
02:32 - talk guys like this says everything for
02:34 - us this is our livelihood this is what
02:35 - we do with 12 hours a day seven days a
02:37 - week do you take a day off rarely my
02:40 - family yeah I work seven days a week
02:43 - Frankie how about you seven seven days a
02:46 - week we come in seven days a week we put
02:48 - in 10 to 12 hours of work trying to
02:51 - create content trying to create
02:52 - something can you back locking and
02:54 - clocking out it's just this is just what
02:55 - we what we do but then when this starts
02:57 - happening right and you can't control it
03:00 - and this is a whole year right to you it
03:03 - might just look like one little line
03:04 - that doesn't mean anything but this is
03:06 - 2018 to current and after being as asked
03:10 - and asked consistent as possible and
03:12 - after putting in as much work as
03:15 - possible
03:15 - things going down that's a little scary
03:18 - right let's see what other comments we
03:19 - got because you guys have been really
03:21 - really great and supportive and I just
03:23 - want to thank you guys for all of that
03:25 - Jonathan says I think the channel was
03:27 - better in my opinion last year for sure
03:29 - that's totally true that's possible too
03:31 - this is happening all over YouTube
03:33 - patrick has gotten some conspiracy
03:34 - theories and goes only corporate content
03:37 - is getting pushed by the algorithm
03:39 - Michael says where's your yeah I don't
03:42 - know about that right I think Michael
03:49 - goes where is your PHP on account how
03:51 - can we help that would be really really
03:53 - awesome guys we're thinking about maybe
03:54 - launching the shirt or something that
03:56 - could do it but we have coding courses
03:58 - so we're trying to make do from that for
04:00 - now Honda says I like your earlier
04:03 - videos okay maybe we'll think about more
04:06 - focused but there's something deeper
04:09 - that we want to get into this video
04:10 - that's been expose a lot of what's going
04:12 - on and we want to go deeper into what is
04:14 - actually happening but we want to open
04:15 - up the discussion and invite all of you
04:17 - guys in
04:18 - like we're gonna put theories forth like
04:20 - we're gonna see how like some things
04:21 - work and some things don't but I have
04:22 - some videos and some channels like right
04:24 - debunk those theories and let yeah
04:26 - there's a lot like nobody understands
04:28 - about YouTube completely and it's just
04:30 - kind of weird so - oh we have some
04:31 - really interesting stuff to show you
04:33 - guys I just think insights in we're just
04:35 - gonna keep trying
04:35 - Joshua flew thank you for leaving a
04:37 - message yesterday my man that meant a
04:38 - lot he's like you got a strain more
04:40 - thumbnails are huge and he's like also
04:42 - asking questions up front so he goes
04:45 - give away a good dude mix it up
04:47 - make it work then repeat Thank You Josh
04:49 - we appreciate him a man yeah we are we
04:52 - are gonna try to strain more because
04:54 - yeah we've discovered it growing right
04:56 - he's been gross he's been running like
04:57 - crazy and and and he streams and I see
05:01 - garyvee streaming and I see Grant
05:03 - Cardone streaming and the the biggest
05:05 - reason I think is that YouTube
05:07 - prioritizes watch time who as one of the
05:10 - most important things yeah watch time is
05:11 - just um it doesn't matter how many views
05:13 - you get it's more like like all like how
05:17 - many minutes total video because YouTube
05:19 - has seen that if people spend more time
05:22 - on its platform YouTube's revenue grows
05:25 - and YouTube grows itself so that's why
05:27 - they changed the algorithm yeah they
05:29 - want to be they need like to eat the
05:30 - girls they need to survive ya know you
05:32 - got to put like the right video is on
05:33 - for YouTube they have to let the right
05:35 - channels go yep videos based on watch
05:37 - minutes and so whichever videos being
05:39 - watched a lot that really really does
05:43 - well but the question comes you know
05:46 - people are like yo that's obvious that
05:48 - makes a lot of sense if you have great
05:50 - quality then you are gonna grow the
05:53 - fastest right if you have great quality
05:55 - of content and your content is like
05:58 - really dense and it's providing value
05:59 - well so we want to question that theory
06:02 - a little bit okay so we want to question
06:04 - that one just for a quick second let's
06:07 - take a look at a few channels here let's
06:11 - throw on some music let's take out a few
06:14 - take a look at a few channels here okay
06:17 - so this video by veritasium was really
06:21 - really informative and in this video he
06:23 - basically says like
06:25 - he says if you are you know he made this
06:30 - video recently about having 36 million
06:33 - balls in a lake as you can see over here
06:36 - and this video just went completely
06:38 - viral okay 36 million views and when he
06:41 - went to speak to mr. beast about it you
06:44 - know mr. beast right yeah the big big
06:45 - channel money guy right buddy yeah right
06:50 - so when he spoke to mr. Bies mr. beast
06:52 - was like yes this video is gonna do
06:54 - really really well and or like very
06:56 - something like what up to him before he
06:57 - posted the video yep yeah and mr. beast
06:59 - was like this video is gonna get 30 you
07:02 - know he's didn't say 36 but he's like
07:04 - this videos gonna be a banger yes then
07:06 - he went and posted it and then it ended
07:08 - up getting huge and you guys have
07:11 - probably seen it it's that one yeah that
07:14 - one down there right so he has a lot of
07:17 - theories around what is making these
07:19 - channels tick what is actually making
07:21 - these channels continuously grow but one
07:24 - of the things that we are finding and
07:26 - this has happening to his channel to his
07:28 - channel is actually on a downward trend
07:29 - a lot of big channels are on downward
07:32 - trend right so that's what that guy said
07:33 - whatever Taylor is something that one
07:37 - comment mr. beast game or commented on I
07:40 - think hey baby
07:42 - so with this happening you know we're
07:46 - we're really trying to figure out okay
07:48 - how do we actually turn this around how
07:50 - did we make it so then our channel can
07:53 - actually not be one of the ones that
07:55 - that dies and so I think what's gonna be
07:57 - cool is we wanted to bring you in on the
08:00 - discussion I wanted to share all these
08:01 - things with you so if we figure a way
08:03 - out you can watch it live if our channel
08:06 - dies you can also watch that happen live
08:08 - but see we're screwed up and see where
08:11 - we screwed up right so let's talk about
08:13 - the quality of content so some people
08:16 - people say man it's the quality of the
08:19 - content and that's what at this game so
08:21 - okay cool content is King content is why
08:25 - channels grow we have 400 videos okay
08:28 - but I would like to turn your attention
08:30 - to this new channel called Janelle
08:33 - Eliana okay
08:36 - she has 1.7 million subscribers she's
08:39 - going at a rate of about 300,000
08:42 - subscribers a day 300,000 subscribers a
08:47 - day and he has three videos she's posted
08:51 - three videos since June she didn't have
08:54 - an instant had a very small following on
08:57 - Instagram so people are like oh maybe
08:58 - she used the email list she didn't have
08:59 - an email list people are like maybe she
09:01 - used Instagram she had 10,000 followers
09:04 - on Instagram how many of those followers
09:07 - would come to one of the videos maybe
09:08 - it's ten thousand ten thousand turned
09:10 - into 1.6 million yeah no I'm not gonna
09:12 - happen yeah so so she's getting 13
09:16 - million views on the videos so clearly
09:17 - it's not the Instagram followers another
09:21 - theory might be oh maybe she's using
09:23 - Facebook or YouTube ads well when
09:26 - YouTube ads you would have to spend
09:29 - about 500,000 to a million dollars okay
09:32 - to throw away a million dollars just to
09:34 - grow while you live in a van I find it
09:37 - hard to believe that she has a million
09:38 - dollars to throw in ads just to get
09:40 - views but she didn't just get views she
09:42 - got a lot of engagement so we know that
09:45 - it's probably not yeah she pushes just
09:48 - as she pulled some trigger that probably
09:50 - she doesn't even understand to somehow
09:52 - catapult her this kind of right there's
09:55 - 64,000 comments okay I'm a bot and I
10:00 - endorse this video but most are real
10:06 - comments right rip independent content
10:08 - creators on YouTube that's funny she got
10:11 - lucky probably to some extent but I mean
10:15 - she got lucky but she did something
10:17 - we're trying to point out the fact that
10:18 - I'm talking to one of his comment lucky
10:20 - lucky me a llama lucky la llama but she
10:27 - obviously did something something
10:29 - catapulted her to that kind of growth
10:30 - pass everybody else like I don't has any
10:33 - channel girl in this fast you know what
10:35 - I came to be literally of its kind she's
10:37 - literally growing first-of-its-kind mean
10:38 - shield if she keeps growing like this
10:40 - with 300,000 subscribers an update
10:43 - like right what's her thing Janelle
10:47 - Eliana yeah for uploads 1.6 million
10:51 - views because of course videos about
10:53 - being in a van that subs 24
10:56 - million all right this is the content by
10:59 - the way I'm just gonna like skip through
11:01 - so you can see the content this is the
11:03 - content yeah she's in her pajamas it's
11:05 - literally like a webcam okay twelve
11:09 - thousand subscribers a day that's not a
11:12 - bad number of subscribers sixteen
11:13 - thousand subscribers a day okay
11:16 - fifty-three thousand subscribers a days
11:19 - her average she's slowing down her
11:21 - channel has time not 300,000 anymore but
11:24 - I mean 50,000 subscribers a day think
11:26 - about that think about that okay and now
11:31 - this is not just we're we're streaming
11:35 - on Twitch right OneTouch cool so now
11:37 - we're not just like she's not the only
11:40 - person but living in a van who also
11:43 - happens to be a female there's other
11:45 - lots of other channels this is just one
11:47 - example this is somebody who's been
11:49 - producing content for years on her
11:52 - channel right consistently and a lot of
11:55 - her content is also solo female van life
11:57 - in the van and making blah blah blah but
12:00 - clearly didn't trigger the algorithm
12:02 - somehow and she's at 300 and 1000
12:04 - subscribers the similar thing happened
12:06 - to jarvis johnson's channel right how
12:08 - come he had 20,000 subscribers and then
12:11 - the next day he woke up and he has
12:13 - 150,000 subscribers literally overnight
12:16 - so when YouTube algorithm favors you
12:20 - there's no rhyme or reason when it wants
12:22 - to you there's also no rhyme or
12:24 - reason they will just destroy
12:26 - your channel and there's almost nothing
12:29 - you can do about it right there I mean
12:31 - you can try to fight it but if the
12:33 - algorithm is not on your side it makes
12:35 - it very very tough so what we're trying
12:36 - to do is not whine about it we're trying
12:38 - to figure out strategies to actually
12:40 - survive it so for example one of the
12:42 - things that we're focusing on doing is
12:44 - doing a lot of live streams because live
12:45 - streams get a lot of good watch time and
12:48 - if our channel has good watch time then
12:50 - maybe our channel can survive
12:54 - okay let's take a look at this right so
12:58 - people message me and they're like cause
13:00 - II you need to make let's see what
13:02 - people are saying in the comments what's
13:04 - going on in the comments let me see I'm
13:07 - gonna read through Donuts fine okay
13:09 - poets Malloy from what I can tell your
13:11 - subscribers are not interested in your
13:13 - content I know because I haven't wanted
13:14 - a single piece of content from you in
13:15 - months along with your average news for
13:17 - sure that could make sense except that
13:20 - our videos don't even get shown to our
13:22 - subscribers you know yes you could be
13:26 - one of the you you could be one of the
13:28 - subscribers that doesn't watch our
13:29 - content but if our video is not being
13:32 - shown to our existing subscribers and
13:35 - subscribers is actually not where the
13:37 - growth happens subscribers has nothing
13:40 - to do with where the growth happens
13:41 - right this girl her growing and getting
13:47 - 1 million 1.6 million views has nothing
13:51 - to do with the existing subscribers most
13:53 - channels that you know don't grow
13:56 - because of their existing subscribers if
13:58 - they grow because their videos are being
14:00 - shown to new people yeah that's how you
14:02 - get more subscribers yep if I show the
14:06 - people that are not your subscribers
14:07 - exactly ok so that's one of the things
14:11 - so I didn't understand that average
14:14 - amount of views for your videos are
14:16 - extremely low yep the average amount of
14:18 - views for the videos are low because
14:20 - they're not being shown in the suggested
14:22 - videos suggested videos you know how
14:24 - like if you go to watch a video of
14:26 - somebody right you're watching like a
14:28 - coding tutorial let's say then on the
14:30 - side of the screen it has the
14:32 - suggestions that's where the channels
14:34 - grow from another place channel to grow
14:37 - or home and recommended things the home
14:39 - page if it's not showing there then
14:42 - you're not gonna grow nobody's gonna see
14:44 - the videos that's why lower views on
14:47 - videos the only reason that video we did
14:50 - yesterday on YouTube is killing my
14:51 - channel got 6000 views in one day it was
14:53 - because it started being recommended on
14:55 - people's home page
14:56 - that's the only reason and that's pretty
14:59 - ironic because people love to instead of
15:02 - ways okay maybe she's not a person think
15:04 - about it boy she was doing something
15:05 - that people wish they could do there
15:07 - her niche for sure totally there is a
15:09 - niche but again there were a lot of
15:11 - other people who are doing the same
15:13 - thing and we're women so how come it
15:17 - went so viral for for her right
15:22 - Hritik says I'm a JavaScript developer
15:24 - because Clara programmer I tried Python
15:26 - I loved it I've shared this channel with
15:28 - my friends that's awesome right they
15:29 - thank you for doing that really
15:31 - appreciate it
15:32 - so let's go deeper right people are like
15:35 - hey cause you if you made coding
15:37 - tutorials you would do really well
15:38 - except we made an entire series on
15:40 - coding tutorials this year 30 days of
15:43 - coding tutorials and it performed
15:45 - horribly right barely any of the videos
15:48 - even got more than 1,000 views and there
15:51 - were great quality tutorials I mean
15:54 - great in-depth tutorials right here is
15:58 - another channel that's doing really well
16:00 - programming with mosh and here's what I
16:03 - want to point out right this video it's
16:06 - a good video but I want you to just see
16:08 - for yourself how much depth there is to
16:11 - this video okay so it's like you're
16:13 - gonna learn all a JavaScript or you're
16:15 - gonna learn JavaScript in one video and
16:17 - if you scroll through this video right
16:20 - and you go through it and you get to the
16:25 - end the most that you actually get to is
16:29 - a pretty much like console dot log
16:32 - statements you're literally pointing
16:35 - things you're not making a button in
16:37 - JavaScript you're not making a project
16:39 - in JavaScript you are literally just
16:42 - learning the syntax of how to call oh my
16:45 - god of the screen yes 1 million views
16:49 - YouTube is like one really some read
16:51 - this thing oh he has more than us okay
16:54 - well well he grew because he was small
16:56 - Channel but his things grew and he did
16:59 - something really smart
17:00 - so he made coding tutorials that were
17:02 - like 1 or 3 hours long or 4 hours long
17:05 - and he just put them together there oh
17:07 - decent tutorials ok there they're not
17:10 - very different from a lot of the
17:11 - tutorials that are out there he put them
17:14 - together to make one three to four hour
17:15 - video then it's learn Python in one
17:18 - video type of
17:19 - thing okay learn JavaScript in one video
17:20 - and then that video just hat ends up
17:23 - getting what no no I'm just putting
17:25 - there guys I acknowledge again cuz he is
17:26 - it right and then that video what ends
17:28 - up happening is that it just gets really
17:30 - high watch time so when a video gets
17:33 - really high watch time YouTube then puts
17:35 - it out in front of other people so
17:37 - that's smart that he took one thing but
17:40 - what happens in the process is it's
17:43 - picking randomly what chance to make
17:45 - grow and which house to not man grow
17:47 - right so I'm gonna so random um who
17:49 - knows yeah so now I'm gonna do for
17:53 - example right I will go to let's go to
17:56 - creator studio and let's see if we can
18:01 - go to I want to go to our livestream
18:06 - that we did just recently we did a long
18:09 - live stream that was very technical it
18:11 - we would create a full application right
18:13 - so for example take a look at this live
18:14 - stream so I'm just gonna kind of skim
18:16 - through this okay and you can kind of
18:20 - decide for yourself if there is value in
18:23 - this or if there's not it's possible
18:24 - this could have zero value to anybody
18:26 - okay
18:39 - testing to see if this works then we
18:41 - keep coating we do a little bit of a
18:44 - Django we start adding in we do some
18:47 - flexbox stuff we start actually building
18:52 - our patient that looks like this is
18:54 - supposed to be like a Craigslist clone
18:56 - and then we end up hosting this thing on
18:59 - Heroku at the end and this can this
19:03 - thing can do a lot of things right
19:05 - you can search up anything you want it
19:08 - connects with Craigslist so it's a
19:10 - three-hour thing so we are going pretty
19:12 - in-depth technically with our content
19:16 - yeah like biting an entire project but
19:19 - if it doesn't get put out in front of
19:20 - people then there's nothing there's
19:23 - nothing that you can do okay
19:25 - because it just won't get shown so I
19:28 - would like to argue that this has way
19:29 - more value than a video that talks about
19:33 - printing console the log
19:36 - statements with hello world definitely
19:38 - but so what gives that that's the
19:41 - question and like there's there's
19:42 - there's countless Kodi videos that are
19:44 - like like on point they're just like by
19:46 - random people that have so much value in
19:48 - them that are probably way better than
19:49 - this and those don't blow up so I don't
19:51 - really understand yeah
19:53 - now come says but your ads help grow
19:56 - your channel not true ads don't actually
19:58 - help grow your channel they're really
20:00 - big it's negligible right a little bit
20:03 - but it's negligible it's it's almost
20:06 - nothing like seriously it's almost
20:08 - nothing it's very very very tiny like
20:10 - most people don't know because most
20:12 - people don't run ads but if you actually
20:14 - run ads it's like so a tiny that it's
20:16 - very negligible like you said it's
20:20 - almost as if YouTube incentivizes
20:24 - channels with easy dumb easy dumb down
20:31 - clickbait when it when hat when has it
20:34 - ever incentive that people who want to
20:36 - teach and learn right so that's kind of
20:39 - the thing that we're sensing here so
20:41 - what's happening is before if you
20:44 - subscribe to the channel YouTube would
20:46 - be like okay I'm gonna put this video
20:47 - out in front of you now what YouTube is
20:50 - doing is each
20:51 - video just stands by itself so you could
20:53 - have subscribed to a channel but it
20:55 - might not put their video in front of
20:56 - you right no it's only putting videos
20:59 - that are like since you know so other
21:01 - something that's really important on
21:02 - YouTube that to win you have to know
21:05 - this is how the CTR is actually one of
21:08 - the most important things so the click
21:10 - through rate CTR click-through rate
21:11 - that's the amount of people that click
21:14 - on your video if it's if they have the
21:16 - option to like if this if the video is
21:17 - on the screen at some point even if
21:20 - you're just like scrolling through
21:20 - really fast
21:22 - whoever clicks on an actually quits into
21:23 - the video and the percentage of people
21:24 - that do that that's the CTR yep so yeah
21:29 - so people seeing your video and clicking
21:30 - on it that's just click-through rate
21:32 - right and it's determined by two things
21:34 - one your title and two trying to block
21:39 - your face as much as possible I'm just
21:40 - kidding
21:41 - and two is determined by your thumbnail
21:43 - okay so if your thumbnail and your title
21:46 - aren't something that people want to
21:48 - click on then
21:49 - your click-through rate will be really
21:51 - low so what happens in that case the
21:56 - only videos that start to do well in
21:58 - such a sense in that or videos that are
22:01 - very sensational right because it's like
22:04 - a newspaper and now everybody's
22:06 - competing for the most sensationalist
22:08 - headline because now my YouTube video is
22:12 - competing with like all these other
22:14 - videos that you're watching right there
22:16 - it's competing with like if you're
22:17 - watching hip-hop content I'm competing
22:19 - with that and because you subscribe to
22:23 - my channel and my stuff isn't coming
22:24 - straight to you you'll never think about
22:27 - watching it right because most people
22:29 - will just watch stuff that's in their
22:30 - home or their recommended that's how
22:32 - Frankie you were saying you want YouTube
22:34 - like that too right
22:35 - that's like that so if you're not being
22:39 - shown based on your so your title and
22:42 - thumbnail have to be super catchy and
22:44 - then on top of that your content
22:47 - obviously has to have a high watch time
22:50 - which is why their channels like free
22:53 - code camp has learned this trick right
22:54 - so I want to point this out so if you go
22:58 - to youtube and you go to these channels
23:00 - right they're smart like in really
23:03 - pattern
23:03 - you know what's going on right which
23:05 - channels are doing well it's not a lot
23:07 - of times because that's the best content
23:09 - but free code camp literally has my
23:12 - tutorial on here
23:13 - Django Python so they have my tutorial
23:19 - on here right and they have all these
23:20 - other tutorials and even with my
23:22 - tutorials what they did that was smart
23:25 - was they took my tutorial and they just
23:27 - turned it into one video right they just
23:31 - connected all of the pieces and they
23:33 - turn it into one video and they have
23:35 - 120,000 views yep and so what that did
23:39 - is that it got them really high watch
23:42 - time on that video when that video gets
23:44 - really high watch time it grows this is
23:46 - why now it's stupid to have playlists on
23:49 - YouTube and people are just putting
23:50 - everything in one video if somebody
23:53 - actually wants to help us out and this
23:56 - would be really appreciated if you like
23:57 - somebody can take our Python course on
24:01 - YouTube like the whole playlist yeah put
24:04 - it as one and then we can post a hunt
24:06 - YouTube you know and then we're gonna be
24:08 - like yes we're back so we're the
24:12 - answer we're gonna be focusing on that
24:14 - so then our watch time on each video can
24:17 - grow because now it doesn't matter if
24:20 - the overall watch time of your channel
24:22 - is increasing okay let's see what's at
24:28 - what people saying I watch most of the
24:29 - time it's very like about seven houses
24:32 - as don't get you anything for the
24:34 - YouTube algorithm yep John that is
24:36 - pretty true subscribers don't either the
24:38 - amount of people that hit the belt does
24:40 - a lot more yep yep a lot of good words
24:48 - well wash that's clean yeah your channel
24:50 - yeah I've taken washes courses and for
24:53 - sure they're great try to improve your
24:54 - presentation if you want more views
24:55 - yours isn't bad but can be improved for
24:57 - sure so we're thinking about making lots
25:00 - of crash course content soon and just
25:05 - make like bunch of really high-quality
25:07 - crash courses I think that will be one
25:10 - thing that can help to channel more so
25:12 - what crash course would you want to see
25:15 - in and drop it in the drop in the chat
25:17 - and we can try to make crash courses
25:19 - around that your channel shows up but I
25:25 - haven't been watching they can do that
25:26 - yep
25:28 - oh and this I just want to point out for
25:30 - fun that Python interest has dominated
25:34 - the JavaScript interest so I just want
25:37 - to shove it in everyone's face python is
25:43 - king this is we're talking about 2004 to
25:46 - 2019 look at this
25:48 - Python is like a snake that just ate
25:50 - JavaScript this makes me feel so happy I
25:55 - started my channel right around 2016
25:58 - right around here and then it grew and
26:03 - it's still growing coincidence
26:06 - all right think not okay let's see what
26:10 - else we got so this is what I was
26:11 - talking about right the click-through
26:12 - rate so our thumbnails haven't been
26:16 - clicked beta enough that's what we've
26:19 - discovered so going forward you are
26:22 - going to start seeing some of the most
26:24 - click baby thumbnails now it's gonna be
26:29 - big we're gonna be putting some meals
26:31 - that just get the most clicks so we're
26:33 - gonna be trying to like gear towards
26:35 - that we don't want to keep like I don't
26:39 - want to keep creating top 3 programming
26:40 - languages to learn in 2019 or what
26:44 - programming language to learn first but
26:46 - YouTube incentivize us that YouTube
26:49 - that's how we grow and survive as a
26:51 - channel this year we actually made the
26:54 - least amount of click baby titles this
26:57 - year we had the least amount of growth
27:01 - so if we focus more on that then we
27:04 - would grow so again with the
27:06 - click-through rate ok 3 percent
27:08 - click-through rate that's not that great
27:10 - right and so 56 million impressions
27:13 - right if out of 56 million impressions
27:15 - you have 3 percent click-through rate
27:18 - well these are the views you're getting
27:19 - 1.7 million if this was 6% we would have
27:23 - about three point something million
27:26 - right if this was 9 percent
27:28 - click-through rate or 10 percent
27:29 - click-through rate well we'll be seeing
27:31 - over 5.6 million views which is 5 or 6
27:36 - times where we're at right now is this
27:39 - total for the channel 1.7 million this
27:42 - is this is for 2019 got it January 1st
27:45 - right this is for 2019 yep
27:54 - hunker is like because you create boring
27:55 - videos I'm sorry about that we do that
27:58 - nothing we can do about that trying our
28:00 - best year yeah found you guys okay
28:04 - people are saying me okay so they're
28:05 - saying a Django rest API crash course
28:08 - yeah Django rest Django rest framework I
28:11 - think we can make that yeah we can make
28:13 - one Frankie can you actually write these
28:15 - ideas down or you or somebody just write
28:17 - this down somewhere because I think
28:18 - these are great ideas slate 34 says
28:22 - Django rest API crash course so yeah I
28:25 - think even api's could be pretty good
28:27 - lucky says fine you guys because Python
28:29 - Django crash course can you learn Python
28:33 - before HTML CSS and JavaScript yes you
28:35 - can
28:36 - Hritik says ecommerce Django crash
28:38 - course yeah that could be good too Jose
28:41 - says that predict you will be fine just
28:43 - keep grinding I really don't think you
28:44 - have anything to worry about in the long
28:45 - run possibly series for kids like teach
28:53 - your kid to program to incentivize
28:54 - adults to learn code to teach kids what
28:56 - if you creators have made it so that
28:58 - could be great then the problem is that
29:03 - we are trying to help professionals
29:05 - actually get job promotions and things
29:08 - of that nature you know so we would want
29:09 - to help kids that we're really geared
29:11 - towards like we the adults
29:17 - I mean yeah there's this guy who plays
29:20 - with little kids in parks like his
29:22 - channel is huge you know we're like toy
29:24 - channels or not I hate that guy's creepy
29:26 - which guys that the old dude I forget
29:29 - his name but I he literally just goes to
29:32 - like parks and plays with kids I guess
29:35 - I'm like what the hell I'm like parents
29:37 - hide your kids from him
29:39 - what are you probably he's looking like
29:41 - a little you know like those if you go
29:42 - to McDonald's or something and then they
29:44 - have like with playgrounds yeah
29:46 - he'll like jump in there and he's he's
29:48 - like a 30-something your old
29:49 - creepy-looking dude and it was like
29:51 - playing a like 70 go I don't wait it
29:55 - makes it even weirder right if he's 30
29:57 - because if you're 70 you can get away
29:59 - with it yeah you're too old no jazz
30:03 - crash course yeah we can do something on
30:06 - JavaScript as well yeah I think so yeah
30:11 - lucky I think that's pretty yeah Eva
30:13 - Barra Carta I think we can try it some
30:17 - content with JavaScript and see how that
30:19 - does and kind of really like go hard at
30:21 - it and just make like an unbelievable
30:24 - learn JavaScript video could we title it
30:28 - learn JavaScript 2020 like pi JavaScript
30:33 - crash course for beginners or JavaScript
30:39 - tutorial for beginners and then like
30:40 - 2020 and like release it next week
30:43 - because that'll do probably well this
30:45 - year and then I'll also do well next
30:48 - year going right now give you like the
30:50 - biggest JavaScript is in one hour learn
30:52 - javascript in two hours and this make it
30:54 - really good like an unbelievably good
30:58 - older wooden performance good is
31:01 - programming with moscow like his
31:02 - crossover a man I I always wonder bro
31:06 - see you pedo I don't know
31:09 - I think the premiere thing he doesn't
31:10 - work cause I've noticed when running
31:11 - videos never shows up and recommended
31:13 - list but if a channel upload something
31:14 - directly then it shows up right away mmm
31:16 - interesting
31:19 - mmm that says my big struggles with
31:21 - classes and inheritance how can I fix
31:23 - this we just released our course Python
31:26 - LP and then enrollment for that just
31:27 - closed but if you DM me on instagram at
31:31 - her cause ICI le ve R Q a Zi you know
31:37 - maybe there's something we can do for
31:38 - you maybe you didn't know about the
31:40 - promotion that we were doing
31:41 - so just DM me there okay and then we can
31:43 - talk from there okay
31:46 - so that's what's happening right let's
31:48 - go forward to to what is so again so let
31:53 - me go here right so we're for the
31:55 - JavaScript crash course JavaScript crash
31:57 - course is gonna be good that's awesome
31:59 - if you definitely do that yeah yeah okay
32:04 - and then um with with our thumbnails
32:08 - we're trying to we're trying to test a
32:10 - lot of things that people would want to
32:12 - click on or how they're performing and
32:14 - kind of we're gonna be going from there
32:17 - so we're trying to create content that
32:19 - is deep that's really helpful for people
32:22 - but then also we got to find the balance
32:25 - of what actually gets the channel to
32:28 - grow so the channel can actually survive
32:30 - you know that's our main goal we just
32:32 - spent we just spent a lot of time and
32:34 - effort for it to just go down and not
32:36 - survive okay let's see if there's
32:40 - anything else we had for you guys yep so
32:43 - those were the main things that I really
32:46 - wanted to hit home on so what are the
32:50 - strategies if we have to kind of break
32:52 - it down to be able to survive the
32:56 - YouTube algorithm I think that and what
33:00 - are we gonna be working on at clever
33:02 - programmers so you can kind of be in on
33:03 - on the end okay more comments are coming
33:07 - in I want to engage with everyone here
33:10 - maash collaboration that could be pretty
33:12 - smart like maybe we could do like a
33:15 - crash course twenty20 like with Marsh
33:18 - that could be cool
33:21 - how this is continuing your passion
33:23 - about try to be as genuine and liked it
33:25 - as possible for sure yeah we'll keep
33:27 - going for that we I mean we have been
33:31 - super passionate and we try to be
33:33 - genuine and never lie or anything and
33:36 - yeah so we'll keep going with that
33:39 - because this year we have been the most
33:41 - consistent actually
33:42 - of almost all of the years of doing
33:44 - YouTube titles like build an app in
33:51 - three hours using JavaScript are the
33:52 - type of tiles I get clicks that's
33:54 - actually pretty good Venkat that's smart
33:56 - yeah if you see a video with that title
33:57 - in the next few weeks well conventional
34:02 - youtubers get hammered
34:03 - yep that makes sense Jango or machine
34:06 - learning first more live streams
34:08 - collaboration with Joshua fluke yeah
34:10 - that'd be great too yeah we're thinking
34:12 - to even do live streams like learning
34:14 - JavaScript right because I haven't
34:15 - refreshed my JavaScript in a while and
34:18 - so I think me learning like would it
34:21 - actually be helpful let me know right so
34:23 - I don't know if you know but like have
34:27 - you seen if you have ever seen my coding
34:29 - content or recording tutorials but let
34:31 - me know what you think of this I'm
34:32 - thinking while I'm refreshed before I
34:35 - make my JavaScript crash course or a
34:38 - Python Django crash course to go through
34:40 - like let's say JavaScript learning and
34:42 - to actually livestream me learning and
34:46 - you and I can learn together
34:48 - I can livestream it so everybody could
34:50 - watch you guys could be on the end I'm
34:53 - thinking that that would actually help
34:55 - you learn it really well cuz you're
34:57 - learning with us and after that live
35:01 - stream is over we can actually create a
35:03 - full-on package just boom boom you know
35:09 - crash course and then release it out
35:12 - onto the world like a masterpiece
35:21 - yeah machine learning is a great loss
35:23 - collab - right
35:26 - hue series on machine learning he's
35:28 - always doing a huge series on machine
35:30 - learning his channel is a series of
35:31 - machine learning isn't it it's great
35:33 - who's right for machine learning yellow
35:34 - Suraj Suraj from hall how about
35:39 - interviewing somebody live yeah that is
35:41 - sexually good - we've thought about that
35:43 - right Frankie
35:44 - yeah you've actually done that I've
35:46 - interviewed a lot of people like on a
35:48 - live stream that's what they mean I see
35:51 - right all right okay how much front-end
36:00 - JavaScript should I know is back-end
36:02 - developer oh that's very interesting I
36:05 - mean if you're a purely back-end
36:07 - developer you probably don't have to
36:08 - know yeah I mean a little bit here and
36:12 - there but overall and it says Kazi you
36:18 - have come across a boot camp and udemy
36:19 - for coastal for just it's a full package
36:21 - very organized hmm Patrick says you're
36:25 - making too much stuff and people don't
36:27 - have time to watch it all they're
36:29 - oversaturated that's the interesting
36:31 - point it's an interesting point but I
36:34 - mean Joshua fluke has been growing he
36:36 - posts two videos a day I mean Gary Vee
36:40 - has been growing a lot of people have
36:42 - been growing by just consistently
36:44 - actually grinding it out and I I do
36:46 - think that these platforms are now
36:48 - incentivizing that behavior for creators
36:50 - like to really be like live I think is
36:54 - great and then to produce content that
36:58 - just gets a really high watch time
37:06 - okay any plans on courses for data
37:09 - science no no plans on data science I've
37:11 - seen that YouTube search algorithm
37:12 - doesn't promote programming videos when
37:15 - I searched live programming videos I see
37:17 - like ten results that's it yeah maybe
37:21 - yeah exactly so maybe I'll push it out
37:24 - maybe not we'll see but the only thing
37:27 - we can do is just keep going honestly
37:31 - and be consistent so this week's plan
37:33 - this week's plan is for us to go alive
37:37 - everyday and then this is day two and
37:41 - then if you guys have questions for us
37:43 - we want to take your questions and
37:45 - answer all of those questions as well so
37:47 - we want to be live we want to provide
37:49 - you as much value as possible as
37:52 - possible and I think that will be a lot
37:56 - of fun this never this never gets old
37:59 - this never gets old and I like it so
38:02 - much live stream learning in the live
38:07 - stream hackathon Travis garnet that's
38:09 - actually pretty smart I can live stream
38:11 - the learning part of it and then then
38:14 - maybe a hackathon like creating a
38:16 - project with JavaScript HTML CSS
38:18 - JavaScript I can live stream that too we
38:20 - can actually do like full day live
38:22 - streams that could be fun like a 12 hour
38:25 - long livestream we're creating a
38:27 - JavaScript application or a Python
38:29 - Django application that could be that
38:32 - could be a lot of fun
38:38 - Joshua Luke posting at a at a prime-time
38:41 - at night when everybody's watching
38:43 - honey llama luckily llama oh
38:50 - the Tony just dropped a bomb it's called
38:53 - YouTube for a reason he was not there he
38:56 - goes that's called YouTube for a reason
38:59 - if jus is not there in the tube then
39:05 - dude this car drops bombs right he
39:13 - caught us off guard he's the most genius
39:16 - out of the entire group yeah we love
39:22 - Tony Tony this yeah seriously that is
39:25 - powerful that is powerful yeah so I
39:27 - guess we have to be there physically
39:29 - literally physically on the daily we
39:32 - haven't created three videos a week but
39:33 - YouTube is like you guys three
39:36 - videos a day yeah but we in turn the
39:39 - last room two videos so I'm thinking
39:41 - live every day and then I'm thinking one
39:45 - video a week that's like a bomb value
39:49 - like H CSS crash course the ultimate CSS
39:52 - crash course the mother of mothers the
39:55 - ultimate flexbox crash course you know
39:57 - things like that
40:02 - Bruna says you need to update your
40:03 - profitable programmer course I'm having
40:06 - some issues with it
40:06 - yep perfect we're gonna update it are
40:09 - you having issues in module four module
40:11 - three and module four I believe right
40:16 - visa black sees nothing reply flick at
40:19 - 30 second nonsense channel says first
40:21 - time here a great combination of Asian
40:23 -  creation I guess somebody somebody
40:28 - noticed I was Asian
40:33 - what's up Zaki Talib how's it going my
40:35 - man PI qt5 that could be fun to to make
40:41 - videos on hi cutie five-card cutie
40:45 - that's the GUI right the cutie cutie GUI
40:49 - framework but in Python or something yep
40:52 - I've never used it meruna says - why's
40:55 - your followers or droppings tricycle
40:59 - yeah that's a lot of SS does he have ass
41:01 - at the end of every word what do you say
41:06 - no when you scroll here I think it
41:07 - spills on here - that's more my life
41:09 - no what are you talking about it was
41:11 - it's it's scrolling because when people
41:14 - send a message it automatically goes up
41:15 - that's react for you son
41:17 - I don't like react is dirty cool a
41:24 - beginner with Python how should I advise
41:26 - okay
41:27 - Bruno yeah yeah we're gonna work on
41:30 - module four and I'm dating it for you
41:32 - okay yeah if you're having an issue on
41:34 - source layer with the 502 gateway back
41:36 - gateway error you can make sure the
41:37 - jingle server is running before you
41:39 - click the view public URL preview page
41:41 - make sure it's running there's little
41:42 - play button because if it's not running
41:43 - then the URL can't access to your code
41:45 - because the server's not running
41:47 - so if your got issue we resolved that
41:49 - and make sure it's running before you
41:50 - view it and then there's another air
41:52 - table issue that we're currently working
41:53 - on right now me and Kazi and another one
41:56 - of our developers is working on in we're
41:57 - gonna try to update the course with some
41:59 - like screenshots or something but we're
42:01 - getting that is ASAP just be patient if
42:03 - you can you can move on to further
42:04 - further modules because the course is
42:06 - modular right yeah we can move on to
42:07 - module 5 or module 6 and learning
42:09 - JavaScript and HTML and all that step
42:10 - and then come back yeah we're gonna be
42:12 - updating module 4 yep that's definitely
42:15 - right you can definitely go to module 5
42:17 - in module 6 because every module is kind
42:19 - of self-contained we have the ultimate
42:23 - JavaScript crash course in a profitable
42:24 - programmer module we have like literally
42:27 - if we release that crash course for free
42:29 - on YouTube that would grow to millions
42:33 - millions maybe we should do that one day
42:36 - but right now it's in our paid program
42:38 - so we won't cool let's see livestream is
42:43 - a good Zacky says for sure that's
42:45 - awesome thanks bro I'll begin with
42:47 - Python
42:48 - how should I advise give it a better
42:50 - approach as far as coding okay
42:54 - build projects passion projects even if
42:57 - you suck and even of those projects but
42:59 - things
43:00 - you built that are not based on you know
43:03 - you're just doing somebody's home you're
43:05 - doing homework assignment or you're just
43:07 - doing like a coding tutorial what I
43:09 - recommend is find a coding tutorial that
43:11 - helps you host the app online follow it
43:14 - like to the dot then once that app is
43:16 - online then start tweaking it and
43:17 - changing it to make it into something of
43:19 - your own so for example what I did is I
43:22 - remember I followed coding for
43:23 - entrepreneurs channel I built up a
43:27 - Python Django tutorial app and then I
43:30 - changed the I built a blog post app with
43:34 - Python and Django and then I changed the
43:36 - code to turn it into a youtube app like
43:41 - basically all I did was like instead of
43:43 - the word each thinks that blog post
43:45 - instead of that it just showed like a
43:47 - YouTube video so I turn it into like a
43:50 - YouTube video cool right so do that into
43:54 - something that you're passionate about
43:55 - or you enjoy and you're gonna become a
43:57 - lot better really fast Ronald Ronald
44:01 - says what you guys up to height Ron says
44:03 - you talk too much I'm sorry I mean what
44:05 - else are we gonna do nobody's talking
44:06 - back to us too much stop talking
44:30 - [Music]
44:31 - I hope they do
44:36 - no no it is it is at five it goes really
44:40 - wanted okay okay cool
44:45 - breaks over back yeah back to talking
44:48 - what are your plugs you can just keep
44:49 - watching that like little segments over
44:51 - and over again hiya bro your stream is
44:54 - lagging sorry we'll try to improve it
44:56 - how much do I pay you to mentor me so
44:59 - you can come to live to LA if you want
45:04 - in person and the deal that we're doing
45:07 - right now it's kind of pretty unofficial
45:09 - and it's what we're doing is three-day
45:11 - in-person boot camp for about two
45:13 - thousand dollars so you can come right
45:15 - here in this apartment you won't live in
45:18 - this apartment but like you will be
45:20 - doing about eight hours or ten hours of
45:23 - just full focus intensives for three to
45:26 - five days straight that will be for
45:28 - about two grand and then if you're
45:31 - looking for other type of mentorship we
45:33 - do have mentorship programs but those
45:37 - are like those are like four months long
45:39 - programs so if you're interested like DM
45:41 - me on instagram at clever cause II see
45:44 - le ve rqa SDI but I am super interested
45:48 - in like hosting live coding programs
45:52 - with you guys why do people make courses
45:58 - on Apple and everybody got Windows I
45:59 - hate Windows I don't think developers
46:01 - should have Windows I genuinely don't
46:04 - think that this should or they should
46:06 - learn how to use vagrant because Windows
46:08 - command lines it's just really bad and
46:10 - so I won't really got better easily did
46:12 - they release something I disavow it
46:14 - still knows no it's always terrible yeah
46:18 - you don't to use Mac use Linux bring
46:20 - ease Linux bro how can I get good at
46:27 - Python programming create projects lots
46:29 - of projects I'll help you
46:30 - Zacky Apple is popular for business for
46:33 - sure I love the look of Aaron thanks
46:38 - Urban says you could give just the first
46:40 - half of the or quarter of the course
46:42 - free on YouTube to up ratings with a
46:44 - javascript course yeah that could make
46:46 - sense yeah
46:50 - where we can we can make definitely make
46:54 - a brand new javascript crash course I
46:56 - think that would do really well
46:58 - your average programmer says how long
47:00 - did it take for you to get your YouTube
47:01 - channel to this point three years three
47:03 - years absolutely
47:05 - yeah it's about like exact crash course
47:08 - on web RTC what is web RTC lucky says
47:15 - that's fine I don't know what that is I
47:18 - forget lucky llama says this dream
47:20 - popped up on my phone randomly and I'm
47:22 - glad as a viewer we could have a convo
47:24 - keep it up y'all I'll be tuned in that's
47:26 - awesome yeah thank you actually this is
47:30 - yeah I think this is what I like about
47:31 - live streams you and I can actually have
47:33 - a conversation so if you drop a message
47:35 - we're reading it and we're responding
47:37 - right back at you so even if you're on
47:39 - this live stream they're like really
47:40 - like are they actually gonna respond
47:42 - we actually are if you drop a message or
47:45 - a question will respond to it oh Jesus
47:48 - loved the music okay I'm bringing it
47:50 - back there we go I love you outro song
47:53 - oh you guys like my outro song let's
47:55 -  play that right now
48:03 - [Music]
48:17 - [Music]
48:31 - [Music]
48:32 - man that thing needs to that song
48:35 - mystical viral baby maybe we need to
48:38 - make music videos about Python and rap
48:42 - about dictionaries in Python ok love the
48:46 - look of Aaron I hate windows - thank you
48:48 - Jeep for hating windows that's that's
48:50 - one hate that I would love to like
48:52 - combine like unite with people on I
48:56 - finished my Python internship it was
48:58 - great I just want to know how should I
49:00 - make my own program should I just follow
49:01 - step by step direction following some
49:03 - YouTube videos yeah identical you can
49:04 - literally watch or go watch my last live
49:07 - streams live stream or my second-to-last
49:10 - live stream we rebuilt a Python
49:13 - Craigslist clone and in that we built
49:18 - this incredible app in three hours the
49:21 - source code is in the description the
49:23 - link to the working application is
49:26 - actually in the description go and use
49:30 - that you that tutorial to build
49:33 - something for yourself you're gonna be
49:34 - very happy any advice for a 16 year old
49:38 - to do freelancing it's simple just get
49:41 - your skills good and then start applying
49:43 - like a maniac on up work and before you
49:45 - do that apply to teach coding and earn
49:49 - your income from there you'll be able to
49:51 - make good amount of income from teaching
49:54 - coding Zaki says you should do another
49:56 - stream where you're doing live coding
49:58 - for sure that's the that's another
50:00 - morning we should do that on a
50:02 - consistent basis I think that's really
50:03 - really good yeah we might do up yeah we
50:05 - might pick on the fly all that might do
50:07 - something like that tomorrow I think
50:09 - that could be good let's do it cool
50:13 - for freelancing which is better
50:14 - front-end or back-end or full stack full
50:17 - start because that's both volsang is
50:20 - pretty good you know for because if
50:22 - you're a freelancing they want you to be
50:23 - a jack-of-all-trades and so a full stack
50:26 - it's pretty good for that be able to
50:28 - translate an idea or goal they have and
50:30 - just get it done so knowing more is good
50:32 - nirvan says how about converting some
50:35 - courses of yours to memberships for
50:36 - recurring income that's pretty smart
50:39 - but we have stayed away from the
50:42 - membership model and the reason is that
50:44 - when you do a membership right for
50:47 - example the same course you would charge
50:48 - $200 for from a membership you're gonna
50:51 - charge $10 a month well you're assuming
50:54 - somebody's gonna stay with you for 20
50:57 - months for you to get the same amount of
50:59 - money back almost two years two years
51:01 - and if you're a small business like we
51:04 - are you can't wait to get your cash two
51:08 - years from this day you actually need
51:11 - that influx of cash today
51:13 - like as in yesterday and that's what
51:17 - actually helps you survive and keep
51:18 - going right because you know Netflix is
51:21 - not a business as profitable I don't
51:24 - know if you know that I didn't know that
51:25 - Netflix is not profitable at all the
51:27 - business knowledge right Netflix is
51:29 - there's no profitability in that
51:31 - business because they want to grow
51:33 - maximally so they keep the subscription
51:36 - model that's super low so they can just
51:38 - keep breaking even over and over again
51:40 - with each customer to get each new
51:42 - customer that break even with each
51:43 - customer and then they just keep going
51:45 - so then they just rent and repeating and
51:47 - growing and then at some point it can
51:48 - pay off once they have a following
51:49 - Bexley
51:50 - if they ever wanted to pay off you know
51:53 - but right now they're just focused on
51:55 - growing aggressively very aggressively
51:57 - so that's the problem with the recurring
52:01 - system that it it um you don't get your
52:08 - cash upfront you just have to wait too
52:10 - long and that is it ends up not being
52:13 - really great for a small business
52:16 - jeet says I love this one too coding
52:19 - Hall daemon yeah dual arm says these
52:23 - streams are just as good as the hyper
52:24 - produced and edited
52:26 - cast episode keep this format up this
52:28 - first produce Oh our first year awesome
52:31 - okay that's smart
52:32 - yes right here these streams yeah that's
52:35 - actually really smart maybe we should
52:36 - just focus on doing these types of
52:38 - streams you know basically cuz podcast
52:40 - it's just a live podcast yeah that's
52:42 - true and everything just check it out
52:44 - you will love it I've created a video
52:46 - called web app awesome I prefer your
52:48 - other tunes
52:49 - yeah this is one of the ones that are
52:53 - really very respectful opinion this yeah
52:55 - I prefer your other tunes yeah I'll
52:58 - prefer your other tunes I like it slid
53:00 - 34 dannika says yes you should what are
53:02 - you replying to tena koe yes you should
53:04 - what soy Sasha says sounds like a
53:07 - terribly good idea rap about Python
53:09 - dictionaries I think the only time I use
53:12 - braces that's it yeah dictionaries
53:14 - that's right yeah my teeth too up
53:17 - but my Python is clean I don't even need
53:23 - Listerine denna cuz it looks pretty good
53:27 - right I clean Listerine and I'm saying
53:30 - mr. bean
53:32 - we're like stop talking to me like that
53:35 - Kazi you're mean no I was singing the
53:40 - song I was doing lyrics let's remain
53:44 - mean oh yeah we gotta do okay we also
53:53 - have a segment on Python news which is
53:55 - gonna be awesome but look creating
53:56 - Python Tina's we're gonna talk about
53:58 - breaking news this week in Python news I
54:02 - think that's gonna be fun we're gonna be
54:03 - doing that blonde says on the full stack
54:06 - developer how to get the first freelance
54:08 - project an upward one you've come to the
54:10 - right place we have a course called AWP
54:13 - you should definitely look into that
54:15 - because that of course is strictly about
54:17 - getting projects up and running and then
54:20 - applying on a upward and landing them
54:23 - yes you can
54:24 - the type of projects that are on of work
54:26 - actually doing them literally taking a
54:28 - project from up work bringing it down
54:30 - and then completing them right
54:31 - completing it and then showing you how
54:33 - to send in proposals and whatnot and
54:34 - actually be an upward developer or
54:36 - freelancer freelance developer yep so
54:40 - that is one way and if you want to
54:42 - figure it out on your own which you
54:44 - totally can just apply to up work a lot
54:47 - ok the simple advice that I will give is
54:49 - apply to upward and as many jobs as
54:53 - possible with a personalized one-minute
54:55 - video message for each never do spam
54:58 - messages hold on to that whoa wait I
55:04 - forgot to zoom out there oops
55:06 - Netflix is troubling dead what are you
55:09 - an advocate of Jack of office or master
55:11 - of one I am advocate of jack of all
55:14 - trades or a god at one or how about both
55:19 - be low and know a little bit about
55:21 - everything and know everything about one
55:23 - thing I think be dangerous in a lot of
55:25 - things rather than be God and one thing
55:28 - because here's how it works okay so
55:29 - let's talk about like your value in the
55:31 - world let's say you're a I'm just
55:34 - talking about like just the world in
55:36 - general right let's say you are a Python
55:41 - let's say you are like a really crappy
55:43 - developer so you're like here if you
55:46 - become a little bit of a better
55:48 - developer you go here now you're making
55:49 - like $15 an hour then let's say you go a
55:53 - little bit higher up you clean up you're
55:55 - like Django rest framework skills and
55:57 - your API skills and your front-end
55:58 - skills now you're like making $30 an
56:01 - hour
56:01 - now you you become even a better
56:03 - developer you're making $15 an hour now
56:05 - you have like five years experience and
56:07 - maybe you can get to $60 an hour $75 an
56:10 - hour now when you become a really
56:12 - high-level consultant you're gonna get
56:13 - capped at a certain point right and
56:15 - we're talking about like now you have
56:16 - five six years of experience but if you
56:21 - are a developer and you're dating you're
56:25 - dangerous enough so you're not super
56:27 - high level but you're like right here
56:28 - you're dangerous enough you know though
56:29 - you can do you can make full stack apps
56:32 - okay then you actually know how leads
56:35 - work in a business
56:37 - you know how to grow a business and you
56:39 - know like what return on investment is
56:41 - and you understand like how do you
56:43 - actually make profit and how to sell
56:46 - things well if you understand business
56:49 - skills now you are here the same place
56:53 - as a guy who is making who you know has
56:57 - like five years and experience as a
56:58 - developer with those two skills do you
57:01 - being dangerous enough in you are now
57:05 - somebody who can charge $75 an hour if
57:07 - you on top of that learn the skill of
57:09 - let's say copywriting a developer that
57:12 - can do copywriting and understands
57:14 - business now you can charge $150 an hour
57:17 - or $200 an hour so I like to think that
57:22 - either you can be an expert and go from
57:24 - here to here or you can be good good
57:28 - good good good good
57:31 - and like five different things and add
57:33 - up to that okay so I like to say be
57:36 - dangerous enough in multiple things and
57:38 - that's what makes you a killer that's
57:40 - what makes you a replaceable completely
57:42 - replaceable or be a god at one thing
57:45 - yeah but then it's risky choice yeah
57:47 - you're not diversified yeah you need to
57:50 - be like Einstein or Steve Jobs or you on
57:53 - the bus kinda but even then there are
57:55 - gonna be a world leader like Elon Musk
57:58 - is good at everything he can come in
58:00 - engineer he'll come into the room of the
58:02 - engineer solve the problem they couldn't
58:03 - solve then he'll go and like speak on
58:05 - stage speak on stage then he'll go into
58:08 - the room of CEOs and solve a business
58:09 - problem that they couldn't solve right
58:12 - then he's an incredible visionary he's
58:14 - good at multiple things we're running a
58:17 - business we're good at multiple things I
58:19 - like Frankie who's sitting behind he
58:21 - knows how livestreams work he knows how
58:22 - content creation works he can edit a
58:24 - video so like for example if he was just
58:26 - a video editor he would just max out
58:30 - right that's just one skill set but he's
58:32 - a good video editor he's dangerous
58:34 - enough he can create content for
58:36 - Instagram that he's dangerous enough in
58:38 - like a second thing right so now I'll
58:40 - say like he's put up here he also can do
58:43 - Android development now he's up here a
58:46 - developer that can create video content
58:49 - in today's
58:50 - is a killer because you can have
58:53 - your own channel and teach these
58:54 - concepts to other people in growth
58:56 - simple programmer Brad Hussey Rob
58:59 - Percival programming with mosh clever
59:02 - programmer Joshua fluke Derek bonus
59:05 - Sir Roger of all all of them are
59:08 - developers who can do video right so now
59:12 - Frankie is like up here do you see what
59:14 - I'm saying like with all of these things
59:15 - you keep getting added up and you stack
59:17 - up very very high so that's why
59:20 - specialising in one thing leaves you
59:22 - very vulnerable in a vulnerable
59:24 - situation I like to say be dangerous and
59:27 - many many many many many different
59:29 - things okay Danny come on you guys are
59:33 - like my digital mentors that's awesome
59:35 - my man's dream more says tips to be a
59:38 - full-stack dev I'm a beginner knows
59:40 - Python basics and bit advanced tips take
59:43 - our profitable programmer course that's
59:45 - paid tips free tips are here build
59:49 - applications that you actually enjoy
59:51 - follow tutorials like coding for
59:53 - entrepreneurs or mine to tour like go
59:55 - watch my video go watch my three hour
59:57 - life thing that we did building a full
59:59 - application with Python and Django stuck
60:02 - on whole stack right go watch that it's
60:03 - free it's on YouTube yeah and then join
60:06 - the course right after that because we
60:08 - need to survive josh says yes cause he
60:11 - packed on his phone but javascript is
60:12 - strong at shirt javascript is super
60:13 - super popular Aaron says first project
60:16 - to do first time nice one bro what's
60:17 - your favorite programmer what's his name
60:23 - the one who said yes he said somebody
60:27 - should be retro actively aborted some
60:32 - engineer made a bug and then he told
60:34 - that engineer that engineer should be
60:35 - retroactive should have been retro
60:36 - actively aborted at birth we have one
60:40 - viewer and twitch is that you Frankie
60:41 - damn it got me really excited doubt it
60:46 - was Linus porn vaults linus torvalds he
60:49 - developed linux he's probably one of my
60:52 - most favorite developers only because
60:55 - he's like a crazy big and it's
60:58 - just kind of funny because he's like
61:01 - Conor McGregor of coding
61:03 - it talks a lot of he's really good
61:06 - you know I plus I got to watch like
61:12 - videos on him and like a documentary of
61:14 - him I'm sure there other developers I
61:16 - just don't follow a lot of developers
61:18 - you know I just don't listen to them or
61:19 - read their stories
61:20 - - Torvalds was one of the only ones that
61:22 - I found and I was like oh this is
61:24 - actually really funny I'm blocked
61:27 - blocked at Java through what if you did
61:30 - a podcast or invite coders or addressed
61:32 - open problems interacting with us is
61:34 - awesome showing how close you and team
61:36 - are involved everyone that supports you
61:37 - loved it orbán that would be awesome I
61:40 - totally love to do that with you guys
61:43 - where you guys can actually come on the
61:45 - channel and talk about what you're
61:48 - building and what kind of problems you
61:50 - have and I'd love to address them what I
61:51 - would even love to do is you can submit
61:52 - your applications to me and every week
61:55 - we do like a weekly review of your
61:57 - applications and I react to your apps so
62:00 - if you have a horrible app then I'll
62:02 - react horribly I'd be like believably
62:05 - and hysterically I'll be like this okay
62:07 - I'd be like like that that's so cool man
62:15 - Thank You Evan sulfur stuff sir for iron
62:20 - what's pub G again is that fortnight
62:22 - just I keep hearing people keep saying
62:25 - pub G what is I'm gonna look it up right
62:28 - here oh this is fine dude yeah I've
62:39 - played this yeah this was fun I'm also
62:46 - thinking to maybe play video games and
62:47 - livestream coding and then like another
62:50 - livestream coding I mean like play video
62:51 - games and answer your guys's questions
62:53 - on YouTube about coding is that
62:56 - something that would be interesting like
62:57 - playing video games and then answering
62:59 - your questions about you - I think that
63:01 - could be pretty fun
63:04 - Kazi why should news Windows is
63:06 - mind-blowing JavaScript unfortunate
63:09 - ha Java said please suggest some
63:12 - projects causing bunnies why should we
63:15 - not use windows for programming I
63:16 - because everything that you try to do
63:19 - windows it's just much harder than Linux
63:21 - command line Linux command line is just
63:23 - clean more control but more a loop
63:26 - arguably a little bit more freedom but I
63:28 - mean if you want freedom gold Linux so
63:30 - like if you want free yeah I was gonna
63:31 - say like if you want true freedom go
63:33 - Linux if you want install build failures
63:36 - and errors go Windows yeah like it's
63:39 - very simple it's really simple
63:41 - watered-down middle ground between Linux
63:43 - and Mac right if you can't afford a Mac
63:45 - or something like okay here's why I say
63:48 - don't go Linux because I went a bun -
63:51 - okay for example the problem and a bun -
63:53 - is that it's really under developed as a
63:55 - OS you can't you I don't even think you
63:57 - can have VLC you can't play a video you
64:00 - don't have a BS on it you can't have
64:03 - like normal applications that you want
64:05 - in your computer you can't have on there
64:06 - so Mac OS is a much more mature and
64:10 - mainstream operating system on top of
64:13 - that they have unbelievable command line
64:16 - so then you combine the two and you go
64:19 - Mac if you can't afford a Mac and you're
64:21 - on Windows and you're stuck then get
64:25 - something like vagrant and learn how it
64:27 - works or get or someway someway virtual
64:31 - machine yeah some virtual machines get a
64:34 - big rent
64:34 - get vagrant yeah vagrant is really good
64:36 - one because virtual machine what I don't
64:39 - like about a virtual machine is that you
64:41 - got to go completely off your computer
64:43 - and then it requires so much processing
64:44 - power and slows you down and everything
64:47 - whereas with vagrant it's in your own
64:50 - operating system and you're using a box
64:53 - from somewhere else and you could be
64:55 - coding in your own favorite coding
64:57 - editor I actually have a blog post I
64:59 - wrote which is really good
65:00 - and it's like let me see if I can
65:05 - vaguely a medium clever programmer I
65:09 - think you should be able to find it if
65:11 - you type it in the ultimate guide to
65:13 - starting with vagrant and the why so if
65:16 - you're a Windows user and you want a
65:18 - second chance at life
65:21 - then go and read
65:23 - blog post this will teach you how
65:31 - sounds like what your life will be like
65:33 - after vagrant okay use your favorite OS
65:36 - since you SSH into this you'll know what
65:38 - SSH you get to be on your favorite
65:40 - operating system okay
65:42 - I personally hated having a bunch of VM
65:45 - ware on my Mac OS because OS is way more
65:50 - mature than the freebie and bad Ubuntu
65:53 - plus VM wares are not native so they
65:56 - slow your computer down and are clunky
65:58 - ok once you learn how to use vagrant
66:02 - you'll be able to follow every tutorial
66:04 - and learn any new technology without any
66:06 - problems no environment problem just
66:09 - because you have Windows or that your
66:11 - Ruby virtual environment is broken or
66:13 - that your pads are all screwed up I
66:14 - remember way back when I couldn't get
66:17 - ipython to work or I couldn't install
66:19 - NPM because of some random stuff being
66:21 - broken in my computer I remember PI game
66:24 - took me two years to install I remember
66:26 - trying to install an UMP I took forever
66:28 - right it's painful yeah okay everyone in
66:34 - the world will be able to use your code
66:35 - if you learn vagrant your higher ability
66:38 - will skyrocket plus you'll be your
66:40 - resume you'll save years of your time
66:42 - and you'll be able to stick with your
66:44 - favorite editor and if you're not sold
66:46 - yet if you're not sold yet you're just a
66:50 - wannabe developer and you should quit
66:53 - with that said this guy takes you
66:56 - through how to install vagrant so just
66:59 - go through this guy's it'll help you a
67:01 - lot okay and it's a really good guide I
67:06 - built it a lot of love okay application
67:12 - min for highlighted when switching been
67:14 - using for over ten years what has he
67:16 - been using for over ten years how that
67:18 - went searching hmm I don't know what
67:21 - Phillip means I'll be streaming on
67:23 - twitch everyday the fool says awesome to
67:25 - fool Linux oh he's been using Linux for
67:29 - 10 years yeah Phillip that's awesome
67:31 - yeah the great thing about Linux is it
67:33 - super super budget look into a Raspberry
67:36 - Pi just running like an Ubuntu or even
67:37 - like uh or any probably we want to it's
67:40 - probably best so you can get that for
67:41 - like super cheap what are the same would
67:42 - be interesting yes Toby what did we say
67:45 - damn I hate this youtube lag what did
67:50 - what are we talking about Frankie when
67:52 - enemy may be playing games and answering
67:54 - questions ah playing games and maybe
67:56 - answering questions that could be
67:57 - somebody said game development tutorials
68:01 - that's cool too I use sent OS do you
68:05 - recommend using it basically I have
68:07 - integrated docker is there a way where
68:10 - we can show these messages on the screen
68:12 - like what's the click of a button I
68:15 - think that would be cool strike that was
68:17 - no over to go or yeah a screenshot Oh
68:21 - [Music]
68:23 - no ii ii ii ii guess actually you're
68:34 - right that's probably the easiest way i
68:37 - was thinking of like a smarter way to do
68:40 - it alright so we've got the live chat
68:45 - here the wonder how we can learn from
68:49 - facebook facebook life too but most of
68:51 - them are youtube okay I'm gonna try to
68:54 - hide away hey whoever said that wasn't
69:05 - was Malcolm fuel hello can you specify
69:10 - what would be interesting that would
69:14 - solve all our problems
69:15 - Thanks
69:21 - okay I'm gonna make the skill really
69:23 - huge hopefully they'll help boom nice
69:26 - dude
69:26 - that is helping right awesome okay cool
69:34 - dad I didn't create a separate you're
69:40 - doing a flooded with tutorial channels
69:41 - and tons of books I mean I'll do it on
69:43 - this channel yeah oh this is don't burn
69:46 - your stuff out cool rap Python
69:55 - dictionaries damn where are we vom she
70:03 - says I used cent OS do you recommend
70:05 - using it basically I have integrated
70:07 - docker environment to my PI charm ID
70:09 - yeah
70:10 - docker is good to vagrant if your isn't
70:12 - pretty good yeah docker is really really
70:14 - good if you're using scent OS and you
70:16 - understand how to use it then cool just
70:18 - keep using it and if you're if you have
70:21 - it integrated to your PI charm awesome I
70:23 - don't even know how you'd figure that
70:25 - out but that's great I have a JavaScript
70:29 - and Java Java course coming up next
70:31 - semester excited to learn about it
70:35 - what python syntax be similar would
70:39 - Python syntax be similarly Java it's not
70:43 - really similar but if you understand
70:46 - concepts of programming and one then you
70:48 - understand them in another yeah the
70:50 - syntax is completely different actually
70:52 - right the syntax is very different but
70:54 - like different words if and else
70:56 - statements exist yes while loops are the
70:58 - same for loops just idea is the same or
71:01 - loose right so like most of the ideas
71:04 - are the same the syntax is different
71:06 - I like Python because it doesn't it lets
71:08 - you be more productive as a developer
71:11 - and you can run things and test things
71:14 - faster and then you can go and actually
71:15 - put your code in Java when I was going
71:18 - to a Java class I actually learned
71:20 - Python first and I would test everything
71:22 - out in Python and then I would quickly
71:23 - put it in Java just because every time I
71:26 - had to run my code I had to compile it
71:28 - in JavaScript Java
71:29 - whereas in Python I could actually just
71:31 - run it in my interactive environment
71:33 - you know yeah which is insane why
71:36 - doesn't don't have just an interactive
71:37 - environment to be able to just run your
71:39 - code that's ridiculous to me and what
71:42 - I'm talking about guys is like you know
71:44 - I can just do this it's a very it was
71:49 - very like and I can just like run code
71:53 - even their programming let me just have
71:54 - this I can remember and I know there's a
71:56 - few I have like these virtual
71:58 - environments like this right I got a
72:01 - notification for your live hello moment
72:02 - you do also review front-end stuff
72:04 - backend stuff and all the other crazy
72:06 - thing when you do a review session okay
72:07 - cool
72:07 - thanks a lot man what's your favorite
72:10 - National Team soccer team Bruno is
72:14 - always screaming in all caps but I love
72:18 - Bruno because he's also in our course
72:20 - the profitable programmer so we love you
72:22 - for that Bruno thank you supporting us
72:24 - in these hard times my man I love you
72:27 - what's your favorite national soccer
72:29 - team from South America besides ARLA and
72:31 - Tina oh that's funny because I'm running
72:33 - at happiness shirt
72:34 - I mean Brazil is pretty cool you know
72:37 - but uh I'm gonna have to go with I'm
72:42 - gonna have to go with yeah Brazil is
72:45 - pretty dope yo Frankie
72:49 - South America Mexico is no what is that
72:54 - it's no it's North America really no
73:00 - it's Central America he wouldn't know
73:04 - he's from Mako he's from the fake Mexico
73:13 - the Calexico come execute all right so
73:17 - Brazil for me Daniel says hi man you are
73:21 - the best no Daniel you're the best and
73:23 - thank you for watching this live stream
73:25 - because you guys are literally helping
73:27 - the channel survive the longer the
73:29 - Watchmen is the more we can survive it's
73:32 - like if you want to help us I'll just
73:34 - leave this running sleeve this running
73:36 - go do your if you have to leave you've
73:38 - got to meet your girlfriend you got to
73:39 - go on a date you got
73:40 - go and relax just leave this running I'm
73:42 - gonna go do another stuff yeah
73:45 - watch this with your girlfriend watch
73:46 - this with your parents put us on a TV
73:49 - you know will answer your parents
73:50 - questions they'll be fun Gary if you
73:54 - recently made a video on IG about the
73:56 - YouTube algorithm are you serious
73:58 - or is he making it up or is Gary V
74:03 - posted too many videos already and it's
74:05 - gone that was so last hour I don't see
74:12 - anything but he care when he says
74:17 - recently does it mean like few days ago
74:19 - because Gary Vee few days ago is like
74:21 - you'll never find it recently made a
74:25 - video on IG used all your content film
74:33 - it for video content leverage your
74:35 - guests audience oh I think podcasts
74:38 - are a triple arbitrage money on creating
74:40 - content here's why you have an audio
74:41 - formal call that people listen to you
74:43 - can fill in the podcast and have video
74:44 - content distribute your guess is another
74:46 - arbitrage they could promote the content
74:48 - on their own channels and bring the
74:49 - awareness our potential is creating
74:52 - written content oh man this is too much
74:54 - it's too much I can't find it Victor
74:59 - moving on stuck at learning JavaScript
75:02 - what to do don't worry we will make a
75:03 - crash course soon and we will
75:05 - destroy everybody else I don't know
75:08 - water I mean your support team is not
75:17 - replying to me related to the course
75:18 - please
75:20 - messy please be just a little bit
75:22 - patient because we have a lot of
75:23 - students who just join a lot of our
75:25 - courses for example we just did two
75:27 - product launches one for Python LP
75:30 - another one for Johnson misses audience
75:33 - so we have bunch of new students
75:36 - enrolling in our programs so gov't job
75:39 - Academy leave a message to our support
75:42 - team and be just a little bit patient
75:44 - and you can reach out to me at clever
75:47 - cause II see le ve our QA CI on
75:52 - Instagram
75:53 - clever Kazi and I will personally
75:55 - respond to you okay if you DM me I
75:57 - respond to almost every single person
75:59 - that leaves something thoughtful so I
76:01 - will respond to you Java is a compiled
76:04 - language exactly 20 cent Josh would
76:06 - learn them a bit Sheikh says to what
76:08 - extent Java should be learned to be able
76:10 - to work on Android studio to a decent
76:12 - extent right I mean it's in Java yeah so
76:16 - this like learn the basics of jungle and
76:18 - be able to build some basic stuff for
76:19 - Java Thanks a Travis thank you for
76:25 - actually answering or responding to
76:27 - Zdenek oh that's awesome
76:28 - I appreciate that yep a UI UX review on
76:32 - your website maybe yeah I can I can do
76:35 - it yeah I can do a UI UX review so if
76:37 - you guys send me your applications I
76:39 - will make a video on them in the live
76:41 - streams and actually do a review yeah we
76:44 - can do a review okay what is shebang and
76:48 - Python I don't know I've heard of that
76:50 - I've heard it this is more informative
76:52 - so I don't miss any episode of this
76:54 - channel okay you got it Chris says I'm
76:59 - just here to support the YouTube algo
77:01 - hack crush a trophic ozzie Chris Russo I
77:04 - saw your comment in our last livestream
77:06 - you said you're a marketer and you would
77:08 - be able to help us dude that would be
77:10 - phenomenal DMA please on IG and I will
77:14 - respond to you thank you so much I
77:16 - appreciate it
77:17 - Philip says this is it that I can what
77:21 - programs you have that I can enroll in
77:23 - Philips week I mean Zdenek oh we have
77:26 - profitable programmer which is our
77:28 - program that who who's who was talking
77:33 - earlier Bruno right that Bruno is in and
77:35 - I think he's really enjoying it we just
77:38 - have to update our module four but
77:40 - profitable programmer is our course
77:43 - that's basically like a 16 week bootcamp
77:45 - - full stack development ok but at a
77:48 - fraction of a price of a bootcamp like
77:50 - thankful is $500 a month I've been in
77:54 - thankful it's a great program you have a
77:57 - lot of other programs that are like
77:58 - range between 5,000 to 15,000 dollars
78:01 - profitable programmer is between 400 to
78:04 - 500 dollars
78:05 - okay so if you're interested let me know
78:08 - or message me on instagram at clever
78:10 - cause II and I'll reply to you we're
78:14 - gonna be launching that course actually
78:16 - soon Chris says yep that was me I'll
78:19 - message you awesome Chris just thought
78:23 - you you maybe could do how to do
78:24 - progressive web apps with Python yang of
78:26 - content I don't know what progressive
78:28 - web apps are but sure I I haven't I
78:33 - don't I don't know if I've made any
78:34 - progressive apps oh sorry I was supposed
78:40 - to be showing all of this so I was I
78:45 - just responded to Danny ko he says what
78:48 - programs you have so I responded to that
78:52 - Thank You Travis
78:54 - Chris says yep that was me what is
78:57 - bootcamp coding stuff you know
79:03 - yeah promote says I'm a big fan and he
79:06 - goes I have enrolled to your Python
79:08 - program awesome my man loved it
79:15 - what's the best bootcamp you guys have
79:18 - joined looking for recommendations who
79:20 - would ask that yeah that question
79:23 - I'm not answering that question oh yeah
79:26 - who's that guy Francisco oh who's that
79:29 - guy we're not answering that question
79:31 - for that guy let's just skip over that
79:34 - question let's just skip over that
79:36 - question yeah
79:36 - skip over that guy yeah I'm gonna skip
79:38 - over that it's the black cyber network
79:43 - no no so my profitable programmer course
79:46 - is not 2k it's much cheaper than that
79:49 - the 2k thing that I was mentioning was
79:52 - we are doing in person one-on-one or
79:55 - like group boot camps with people so you
79:58 - can come in and we'll do three days in
80:00 - person with you or three to five days in
80:02 - LA in Hollywood and for that it would be
80:05 - around 2k we're still working that out
80:07 - but once we have people coming in I know
80:10 - it'll go more than that but for now
80:12 - that's where we'll keep it almost like a
80:13 - bootcamp like a coding boot camp with
80:16 - cause II and my team how can we learn
80:21 - best to kinter programming my Opie
80:23 - course is pretty good for that
80:25 - that goes a lot over Opie programming
80:28 - electrons so you you can message me at
80:33 - my Instagram is at clever cause II so
80:38 - you can message there that work my
80:42 - parent yeah cheese cheese they're like
80:44 - things like whoa it just went to all
80:46 - platforms let's see for work it's crazy
80:50 - should be there probably damn I got
80:55 - three messages from your channel it's
80:57 - working what does that mean it's working
80:59 - oh the multiple chat or something
81:03 - speaking of ways a doctor queen mention
81:07 - energy says hello speaking of ways of
81:09 - how to win against the algorithm are we
81:12 - yes we are
81:16 - yeah we're trying to get past the
81:20 - algorithm and get ahead of it and beat
81:23 - it and so we're gonna be creating a lot
81:25 - of content that's gonna be like clique
81:29 - baby type of titles and images except
81:32 - it's gonna be like really good content
81:34 - and we want to make sure our
81:35 - click-through rates are really high we
81:38 - want to have high watch minutes so what
81:40 - we're gonna do is like instead of
81:41 - creating a series of videos we're gonna
81:44 - just create one video that's like a full
81:46 - Python course like 3 or 4 hours long a
81:48 - lot of smart channels are finding out
81:51 - about this and that's what they're doing
81:53 - to grow their channels yeah tech leap
81:58 - collab I'd love to collab with tech lead
81:59 - if any of you guys want to message him
82:01 - on my behalf that would be so amazing
82:03 - but yeah we'll reach out to tech lead at
82:05 - some point - should I learn app
82:10 - development and suggest me okay yeah AB
82:12 - development school I got peeps moving
82:15 - out there when I'll be ready thanks for
82:17 - that cool that'd be awesome man yeah
82:19 - black cyber network let me know if
82:21 - you're ever interested in that role gots
82:23 - has just got in what's up roll what's up
82:25 - my man why are you skipping my questions
82:30 - I asked for a github repo for some
82:32 - inspiration can you come on Kazi then
82:36 - why are we skipping his questions man
82:42 - this must be a part of a bigger
82:44 - conspiracy than we know why why are you
82:52 - leaving Satish out could it be could it
82:56 - be just to attack against the t-sh
82:59 - I don't know man I think it's possible
83:02 - [Music]
83:11 - Kerrick carry over the water oh yeah
83:13 - hold on hold on keep going
83:19 - hold on good this is to like that's
83:27 - funny okay let's go back to it
83:30 - all right so my github is clever
83:32 - programmer type that in and you shall
83:34 - find it my friend yes and some
83:36 - inspiration go out there and kick some
83:38 - ass and quit being a to
83:40 - teach let's go baby
83:42 - code why can't you code for ten hours a
83:44 - day just code for ten hours a day okay
83:46 - code for ten hours a day I'm actually
83:48 - not kidding I got really good in a very
83:51 - very short period of time at coding
83:52 - because I actually code it for 15 to 18
83:55 - hours a day for three to six months and
83:57 - then I got the same results and most
83:58 - developers get in about four to five
84:00 - years that's how I was landing clients
84:02 - for 50 to $100 an hour and that's how I
84:05 - was actually making 104 thousand dollars
84:07 - a year while I was actually going to
84:10 - Community College as a 21 year old so
84:13 - that's what I would say for motivation
84:15 - just can you can you hit this at the
84:20 - right time
84:22 - can you go back there we go this is
84:36 - awesome I left alright next one okay
84:53 - so teach got us worked up so the
84:58 - satiation knows how to push our buttons
85:03 - progressive web apps work both on
85:05 - desktop and also exactly like native
85:07 - apps on mobile with local sort of push
85:09 - them to something in the future that may
85:10 - kill native mobile app development for
85:13 - sure and for mobile app development
85:15 - I believe flutter is also gonna be super
85:18 - powerful right flutter is gonna be
85:20 - pretty awesome really but I mean oh if
85:23 - I'm not showing the messages please let
85:24 - me know so we got flutter all these
85:30 - changes I mean there's a delay but it'll
85:32 - come back change what yeah yeah it'll be
85:35 - there so flutter is gonna be actually
85:40 - huge for app development so everybody
85:42 - this is if there's a trend as a
85:45 - developer to follow this is one of the
85:47 - hottest trends to follow and be on top
85:49 - of so if you do iOS and you're trying to
85:52 - look into Android development
85:53 - specifically don't do that
85:56 - use flutter Google released it Google is
86:00 - pushing it forward like crazy and the
86:02 - reason is because for flutter you don't
86:06 - need to know Java to create Android apps
86:09 - and you don't need to know iOS to create
86:10 - the iOS or sorry Swift to create the iOS
86:14 - apps you can just learn flutter and it
86:17 - natively builds it for both at the same
86:19 - time one language one language so this
86:22 - is them all really huge fast development
86:26 - okay maybe we'll make a course on this
86:30 - too expressive beautiful you eyes okay
86:33 - native performance
86:35 - so really Alibaba is using it Google
86:39 - Google Ads and so you know I mean Google
86:43 - rolled it out so it makes sense that
86:44 - they're using
86:48 - alibaba's app has 50 million plus
86:50 - downloads per reflect Li whoa a
86:59 - beautiful Journal and mindfulness AB
87:02 - driven by artificial intelligence I'm
87:04 - actually curious what reflect Li is now
87:06 - Jack needed to let her reflect Li of
87:13 - course what is it dude mindfulness yeah
87:19 - he's checking it out because of that
87:21 - he's uses machine learning for journals
87:28 - okay I don't know about it let's stop
87:32 - wasting my time on riff luckily what is
87:34 - it well reflect Li yeah what's Aaron's
87:37 - position in the team Aaron is our
87:39 - product development and he's a friend
87:47 - he's a you what any what who are you why
87:50 - the are you here Frankie throw is
87:54 - that sour actually just live in his
87:56 - closet
87:56 - like I just not needed a place to crash
87:58 - one day so I'm just around you know I
88:00 - don't really add anything to the team
88:01 - I'm just here seven days a week eating
88:05 - his food eating enraging his life's true
88:09 - drinking my coffee
88:10 - exactly invading the live streams eating
88:14 - my trip never bringing my trail mix no
88:16 - you actually did I'm just another guy
88:19 - that creates content for the channel I'm
88:20 - just another content creator I provide a
88:23 - different flavor and style that cause he
88:26 - does and I create some product I have a
88:27 - product out oh yeah are you creating a
88:30 - product that's totally forgot WP yeah
88:32 - that was actually meaning that con so
88:34 - you so does it matter if you create a
88:36 - product does it matter if I created
88:38 - product yeah does it help the world does
88:42 - it help yes it helps the world of course
88:44 - Wow finally earned being confident I was
88:48 - waiting for some weird self deprecation
88:49 - joke huh
88:51 - so Victor Aaron is actually rolandic
88:53 - client so Aaron sucks at explaining who
88:56 - he is
88:56 - I'll do it for him Aaron is an
88:58 - incredible badass he's a product of
89:00 - and he kicks ass on our team okay he is
89:03 - not only good at coding and development
89:05 - he also is part way through done with
89:08 - his master's at what is the Oh
89:10 - Georgia Tech and okay
89:13 - he's not only a developer he can create
89:15 - content which is incredible and he's
89:17 - built a brilliant product at over a
89:20 - hundred students plus enrolled in called
89:22 - automate with Python so he's pretty epic
89:26 - but he's just very self-deprecating and
89:28 - he can never get those words out of his
89:30 - mouth it probably is hurting him from
89:32 - the inside right now he probably has to
89:36 - say something shitty to just feel okay
89:37 - right now your titles are man I wish we
89:47 - had airtight and now I miss not having
89:49 - Aaron title and no okay your titles are
89:52 - very good thank you great I'll be tuned
89:54 - in for the Python course awesome we'll
89:55 - make something make sure you bring
89:57 - coffee respect lead man okay I'll bring
90:00 - something well how do these guys
90:03 - speaking in cannot all caps so
90:06 - aggressively and also I don't have a you
90:09 - in my name what's up with kuzey
90:11 - what's up kuzey what about light you me
90:14 - what's up ibuprofen
90:16 - [Laughter]
90:20 - that's how Frank he says ibuprofen he
90:23 - says I able proven
90:36 - ibuprofen I okay so what was the
90:43 - question what's the job to get home link
90:48 - that's cool yeah pycharm it's awesome my
90:50 - charm is awesome oh okay
90:56 - oh that is a good way to work around
90:57 - instead of negatively misleading the
90:59 - viewers you're positively misleading
91:01 - them to content that should be
91:02 - beneficial to them clever exactly yep
91:05 - what they want give them what they
91:06 - positive manipulation so here's so I
91:09 - don't know if you guys know but do you
91:11 - know what's the difference between a
91:14 - leader and a manipulator a manipulator
91:22 - only one thing or what's the common
91:26 - thing between them right what is it they
91:29 - influence people they change people's
91:32 - behaviors that's it they post manipulate
91:35 - one does it for the benefit of him or
91:38 - herself the other does it yeah the other
91:42 - the leader does it for the benefit of
91:44 - the other person yeah that's it
91:47 - yeah that's the only difference
91:49 - manipulation is the same thing as
91:51 - leading is just one is done for benefits
91:54 - both which is he so that's why there are
91:59 - people who are scam artists and then
92:01 - there's people who run businesses both
92:02 - can be really really profitable what
92:06 - does he bless platform if I ever don't
92:09 - have that please just remember just look
92:11 - at it actively if I ever don't have that
92:13 - screen put it up because then they can't
92:15 - read the comments best platform you get
92:19 - app development courses I don't know
92:21 - actually rolls has enrolled in your
92:23 - Python Opie course excited to learn yeah
92:31 - that's awesome roll I love it my man
92:34 - Danica says nice job thank you what are
92:37 - your thoughts on hold on ha ha thoughts
92:41 - or Bulger that's how I read all the
92:50 - so yeah it's good
92:53 - you know blockchains oh I don't have
92:56 - many thoughts I think I think
92:58 - everybody's a liar who says that
93:01 - actually understand it
93:02 - here's simple terms there are no simple
93:05 - terms for it no all it is if you push it
93:07 - up nobody can take it down that's simple
93:10 - things I understand like that it's
93:12 - perfect
93:13 - nobody can with you if you put
93:14 - stuff there and then Bitcoin works off
93:17 - of blockchain technology so it's like
93:19 - traceable supposed to be secure is
93:21 - supposed to be foolproof but like Who am
93:23 - I kidding okay if anybody actually
93:25 - understood it they would be creating
93:26 - their own cryptocurrencies from scratch
93:29 - very few though very few and even the
93:32 - ones who are don't have to understand
93:34 - how it works
93:35 - they're just creating it like none of us
93:37 - actually know at a very deep level how
93:40 - electricity truly works like how deep
93:42 - Newton knows it but guess what we don't
93:44 - have to right this is how I think about
93:46 - like blockchain like I think if you get
93:49 - truth really deep nobody really knows
93:52 - except for like Satoshi Nakamoto you
93:54 - know but like everybody else is just
93:57 - just like you'll be is is is earth flat
94:05 - right maybe so so you know the answer is
94:09 - like you you know that the earth is
94:12 - revolving around the Sun right but you
94:14 - don't know that
94:15 - you just heard it you just heard it you
94:18 - have no idea but I have no hunger center
94:20 - but you but you're even 99% sure because
94:23 - of just what you've been hearing from
94:24 - people what you've been hearing from
94:26 - your teacher
94:26 - yeah we're flattered with those guys you
94:28 - haven't figured it out from scratch
94:30 - right you don't actually have the tools
94:32 - to figure it out most people don't I
94:34 - don't I believe that it's true you could
94:38 - because people said exactly that's the
94:41 - problem right you still create apps
94:43 - right kick-ass apps yeah so those are my
94:47 - thoughts on blockchain DTaP SAS is it
94:51 - necessary to learn Java in 2019 I don't
94:54 - know if you need to do Java jobs you
94:55 - probably got to learn Java if you don't
94:57 - want to do jobs in Java you probably
94:58 - don't have to learn it okay mogera says
95:01 - we'll be fine breath 371,000 selves I
95:03 - believe in you thank you so much I
95:04 - believe in you too
95:05 - never heard of flutter is it anything
95:07 - like the Mannion I've heard of them or
95:10 - in it
95:15 - what do you mean $1.99 whoa somebody
95:21 - send one dollar ninety-nine cents one
95:23 - twitch whoa whoa dude right there oh
95:30 - uh-huh how do I stop being a little
95:31 -  and just crush it I sent you to do
95:33 - dog Charlie garnet was he the one whose
95:36 - question I answered earlier or no no I
95:39 - was it was no no okay there's somebody
95:41 - else okay I have a solution for you no
95:45 - no it was a minion guy Oh Victor asked
95:50 - about Aaron what are you trying to show
95:51 - us on here I have somewhat of a solution
95:53 - for you hold on hold on what do you do
95:54 - oh yeah go for it
96:07 - [Music]
96:15 - did that help Victor yeah and if that
96:19 - didn't help we got something else for
96:21 - you
96:22 - coding is not hard you just have to
96:29 - solder is good in five years in only
96:32 - three months funny there you go that's
96:39 - your answer hopefully that answers it
96:43 - learn Python bro gonna take off soon as
96:46 - the number one language oh hell yeah
96:48 - like it's already crushing JavaScript
96:50 - and interest yeah also Stack Overflow
96:52 - now the number one and most asked
96:54 - questions are around Python and then the
96:57 - number one most used language unless you
97:00 - Sparkfun yep
97:04 - when you when will you be releasing your
97:06 - Opie course and on what price we just
97:09 - released Opie course so the enrollment
97:10 - is closed but we will be releasing
97:13 - profitable programmer soon and once we
97:17 - release profitable programmer course we
97:19 - will be releasing it until 2020 it's the
97:25 - Illuminati they're censoring their
97:27 - channel those are Plutonian alien
97:30 - demonic hybrids Jesus Christ
97:33 - probably Wow nice he says Wow nice Wow
97:37 - leader inspires he dance right now okay
97:40 - well dance oh my god you're controlling
97:44 - us guys will do anything for views see
97:47 - we'll see
97:48 - how low we've gotten see your leader
97:51 - yeah you're benefiting us by dancing
97:58 - it's healthy right it's healthy right
97:59 - humiliating you're a leader humiliating
98:02 - but dancing I mean but fine but healthy
98:04 - fun imagine somebody just jumping in the
98:08 - live now
98:13 - don't hit my mic he'll blow somebody's
98:16 - ear off wash can you go back to having
98:20 - the master class well we had the master
98:23 - class it's kind of over offering the
98:27 - class oh maybe I'm confusing something
98:29 - Joseph K PyCharm or a V s code PyCharm
98:34 - PyCharm is my favorite vehicle have to
98:36 - agree with him on that one
98:37 - yeah Mia's code is cute Aaron what are
98:41 - you specializing in in your master's
98:43 - program if anything at all if anything
98:46 - I'm Isis my specialization is
98:49 - interactive intelligence which is kind
98:51 - of a weird term
98:52 - I'm just required to confuse the weird
98:56 - collection of classes but pretty much
98:57 - it's just a bunch of AI and a little bit
99:02 - of what development some hyper ones
99:03 - computing and a little bit of computer
99:06 - architecture that's why it's like it's
99:08 - like a match of everything and I like
99:09 - how people on the track of computers
99:11 - it's just kind of like a mishmash I mean
99:12 - well what's that what what nothing I'll
99:32 - get it you'll get it when you watch the
99:34 - stream Aaron's new haircut is not wait
99:38 - hold on I'm sorry I put the emphasis on
99:39 - correctly two seats but it's easy
99:41 - there's new Ron's new haircut is not
99:44 - cool hold up hold up what it suits him
99:47 - pretty much good Python Loki taking over
99:55 - Duke it out of us Hussein yep I mean
99:58 - Python is taking over
100:00 - I just came whoever says I think he
100:02 - means like he just got here on this live
100:04 - stream yeah what else could he possibly
100:08 - mean you know these kids just now
100:15 - starting to watch a master class part
100:17 - two awesome master classes awesome go
100:18 - enjoy it
100:19 - I meant the program you said just
100:22 - clothes noona coding would hate to miss
100:23 - out for finding
100:24 - about you now yeah Joseph Spencer if you
100:27 - join our email list by going to clone a
100:29 - programmer comm and signing up for
100:31 - anything free you will be hurting your
100:34 - ear if you join the what is it that's
100:39 - okay if you sign up for anything that's
100:43 - free on clever programmer will have your
100:45 - email list and you'll find out about it
100:46 - by the way a Kazi bro what's up bro it's
100:54 - funny because messages retracted here
100:56 - but you can still see it on our chat so
100:58 - he retracted it but this is by the way
101:00 - Kazi bro yeah sorry I was saying your
101:03 - hating on my hair so they can retract
101:06 - the comment is no longer retracted you
101:08 - can run but you can't get retracted as
101:10 - this is the real blockchain yo this is
101:12 - yeah this is blockchain this is a
101:14 - blockchain words will have Python news
101:16 - for you guys too coming up in the next
101:18 - livestream that's gonna be pretty
101:19 - freakin awesome I'll even do some stuff
101:23 - on like
101:27 - I'm thinking to even do something like
101:31 - stuff on the whiteboard for you guys at
101:33 - some point what we have here is some
101:37 - cloudy weather here hold on what else oh
101:54 - yeah I don't know cleavage for this come
101:56 - on we have some cloudy weather here what
102:00 - other content yeah we have a little more
102:02 - cloudy weather here Python more cloudy
102:05 - over here AI and machine learning those
102:10 - are some things we have to talk about at
102:11 - some point oh definitely
102:13 - how it's gonna be fun that's gonna be
102:15 - part of our news between AI machine
102:19 - learning shall we shall david says it's
102:22 - better to get good with code HTML CSS
102:25 - javascript before going bananas with
102:27 - python is it better to get good with
102:30 - HTML CSS javascript before but as if I
102:33 - just want to get entry-level web dev job
102:35 - so to get an entry-level web dev web dev
102:40 - job yeah it makes a lot of sense to go
102:41 - HTML CSS JavaScript it's totally fine
102:44 - that it's not gonna hurt you at all
102:47 - it just depends what you want to be
102:49 - working in and what you like where
102:51 - you're at right if you're a complete
102:52 - beginner I like to say goal Python
102:54 - Lauren Python if you are past being a
102:58 - beginner and you already have some
102:59 - experience would say like JavaScript or
103:01 - something then just keep going and like
103:03 - go for the job and start applying to
103:06 - places and also all of us don't be
103:08 - afraid to go on up were calm guys like
103:10 - go to up were calm okay watch
103:12 - how this how easy this is right this is
103:16 - how you should look for jobs click jobs
103:18 - click Python this is like freelancing
103:21 - jobs make sure you type in correctly
103:23 - unlike me Python okay and then you can
103:27 - like look for what jobs are out there
103:29 - somebody's looking for Django developer
103:32 - oh okay look for something that's like
103:35 - easy right numpy expert maybe you're not
103:37 - a numpy expert maybe you can't do that
103:38 - but Python code integration from
103:40 - two scripts that looks easy apply for
103:42 - this Django software update apply for
103:45 - this if you want to do something with
103:47 - web development
103:49 - type that in and see what kind of like
103:51 - web development or web developer jobs
103:53 - are out there so we're press developer
103:56 - to rebuild and launch a series of pages
103:57 - okay this is easy
103:59 - let's go apply for this right now and
104:01 - you can try on this this is easy but the
104:03 - pro tip that I give here to everybody is
104:06 - send a one-minute personalized video if
104:09 - you can or a personalized message always
104:11 - personalized okay developer need it for
104:15 - converting web designs of Squarespace
104:17 - and blah blah
104:18 - yep so see this stuff is not that hard
104:20 - let's see if there's any JavaScript
104:22 - stuff which I'm sure there is xamarin
104:29 - developer needed for long term projects
104:31 - oh yeah I had to look up a xamarin was
104:35 - JavaScript pry sticker widget right I
104:38 - breathe it out so you could do that
104:40 - what's the difference between flutter
104:41 - and xamarin then okay so let's see
104:52 - flutter versus the shortcomings of
104:58 - native mobile app development
105:00 - traditional mobile app developers slow
105:02 - and more consist business have to
105:03 - develop a separate app for each platform
105:07 - so xamarin is arguably one of the
105:09 - leading open-source cross-platform
105:11 - technologies flutter and comparison
105:14 - that's what I care about
105:19 - okay
105:35 - okay so a lot of people are using
105:37 - zamarons more popular as if now
105:41 - Microsoft has one point four million
105:44 - xamarin engineers wait what
105:49 - hold on dance how many employees is
105:53 - Microsoft have googling that just blew
105:59 - my mind
106:05 - how many so how can you have I think it
106:18 - says Microsoft claims that 1.4 million
106:21 - xamarin engineers o users people who are
106:24 - using it not people who work for them
106:27 - right oh my god that would be scary
106:29 - please anybody hasn't maybe working for
106:32 - them floater community isn't large
106:33 - enough yet some engineers recognize
106:35 - Florida as a budding alternative so
106:37 - making tutorials on Florida could be
106:38 - pretty cool too below we'll take a look
106:40 - at the characteristics and major
106:42 - features of the two frameworks so the
106:43 - insights aren't fully conclusive okay so
106:47 - flutter kind of uses one language
106:51 - portability ios and android ocean
106:54 - stammer and uses everything
107:01 - man that's a good point I don't know why
107:05 - somebody would use flutter or versus
107:09 - xamarin I'm literally trying to figure
107:17 - it out oh yeah because you can run away
107:20 - from sea shark
107:21 - that's one good reason dart is a
107:24 - much simpler programming language paint
107:30 - your life paint your UI to life with
107:33 - dart VM instant hot reload maybe we
107:36 - should make some stuff on this bro this
107:38 - would be fun let's do like we make a we
107:40 - learn maybe we will learn flutter alive
107:42 - and then we'll make only yet you know
107:48 - let's look at this so class segment in
107:50 - links equals four to string okay it's
107:54 - looking very java ish you should not
107:59 - really t9 Java it should kind of looks
108:01 - Libya sh to me a little bit in Java
108:04 - I don't know much reading class segment
108:06 - Kotlin swift okay so we're gonna look
108:12 - into flutter at some point maybe a app
108:15 - that uses Django rest framework for the
108:17 - API and then use this flutter for the
108:20 - mobile app development and I think it
108:22 - could be cool to have an app right here
108:24 - that people can see and then some Python
108:27 - I think that'll be a fun tutorial but
108:31 - yeah this is what I would do to look up
108:33 - like you know this type of stuff with
108:35 - JavaScript and everything yeah this is a
108:38 - honestly I think flutter because it's
108:43 - just maybe a little bit easier that's
108:44 - the only thing I can kind of point to as
108:46 - if now let's see what else is there
109:00 - so flutter has a framework called so
109:04 - here's what I get out of it right
109:05 - flutter has a framework called skia
109:07 - which everywhere as xamarin has mono and
109:10 - how i think of it is like python has
109:12 - flask and then a python is flask and
109:14 - Django and Django has more batteries
109:16 - included so I think flutter with skia
109:19 - it's saying that the framework has you
109:23 - know dart framework which has most of
109:25 - the components inbuilt so it's bigger in
109:27 - size and often does not require so Dart
109:29 - okay is a little bit bigger then I guess
109:33 - what xamarin is using so so that means
109:39 - that you have more batteries included
109:41 - you can create stuff without actually
109:43 - having to bridge everything creating it
109:45 - from scratch mostly which I usually like
109:48 - you know this is why I like Django
109:49 - because you I can build apps a lot
109:51 - faster my mic is about to die so just be
109:54 - very aware of that and be very aware of
109:57 - that to Frankie if you can just like
110:00 - tell me once it's done how's that one
110:02 - doing there
110:06 - okay let's see if we're getting
110:08 - questions from people flutter is nice
110:15 - how's it going yeah how's it going oh

111:08 - what they said like with they use
111:09 - certain terminology Ranger like Oh

111:13 - issue and my name is this address them
111:15 - by name and used as many words as they
111:17 - did so they know you read it and but
111:19 - then also give value and video form and
111:21 - that you care yeah yes and the video
111:23 - format it's what I've been max out your
111:24 - human skills and that's the best way to
111:26 - line clients no matter what yes because
111:28 - it's a human that's reading it on the
111:30 - other side okay very important on a
111:32 - computer full-time job versus up work
111:34 - I'm a fan of up work I hate anything
111:36 - that ties me that's my feed me
111:39 - personally I just hate schedules I hate
111:41 - being told what to do but I do stuff by
111:43 - myself I will work 15 to 18 hours a day
111:46 - no problem I'll work hundred hours a
111:47 - week no problem I just like doing things
111:51 - on my own schedule so that freedom is
111:54 - incredibly important to me like in two
