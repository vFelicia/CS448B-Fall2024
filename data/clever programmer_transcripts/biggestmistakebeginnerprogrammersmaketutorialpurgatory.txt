00:00 - - Today we are gonna be talking
about tutorial purgatory
00:04 - and how we end up getting
stuck inside of it.
00:07 - How that affects your life,
00:10 - and will basically be the
thing that ends your career
00:13 - or rather will stop you
00:15 - even from being able to start a career.
00:17 - We'll talk about why it takes
place and I'll talk about
00:20 - how you can pull yourself out of it.
00:23 - Without any further ado,
00:24 - let's jump right into it!
00:27 - Hey you, what is up!
00:28 - How's it going?
00:29 - This is Qazi or Pop Python
from cleverprogrammer.com.
00:32 - Now this is the, also
a challenge I'm doing
00:35 - which is one video a day.
00:37 - So we're gonna keep on going with this.
00:39 - This is day six, video six.
00:42 - Which is pretty exciting
00:44 - and if you want to keep
up with my challenge
00:46 - and do something also in those 30 days,
00:49 - you can follow along with
me and do it live everyday.
00:52 - Alright?
00:53 - You can be coding for 30
minutes a day, or an hour a day,
00:55 - whatever it may be and
to follow my challenge
00:58 - and everything else I'm been
doing behind the scenes,
01:00 - do follow me on Instagram.
01:02 - It's CleverQazi.
01:04 - Follow me there and you can see
01:05 - all the behind the scenes stuff.
01:07 - With that said, let's continue.
01:09 - So, tutorial purgatory.
01:11 - What is that?
01:12 - I'm gonna write this
one with a red marker.
01:15 - Tutorial, this is a terrible marker
01:18 - so we're gonna switch it up.
01:20 - Tutorial Purgatory.
01:23 - Now, this concept, what this talks about
01:26 - and what this refers
to, tutorial purgatory,
01:28 - is that you have all
these tutorials online
01:32 - that you can learn from, coding.
01:34 - You have all these courses
you can go through.
01:37 - But how come you go into a course
01:39 - but then you find yourself
forgetting everything?
01:41 - And then you just find yourself
going through that course
01:44 - again and again and again and again,
01:46 - and again and again.
01:47 - Why is that happening?
01:49 - What is going on?
01:50 - There's something wrong.
01:52 - Something is going on.
01:53 - And this usually a red flag, alright?
01:56 - This used to happen to me all the time
01:58 - when I was starting to code.
01:59 - And what would happened
with me is I would go, okay.
02:02 - You know, let's say I'll go through
02:03 - a Codecademy tutorial for Python.
02:07 - Codecademy tutorial for Python.
02:11 - Alright?
02:12 - So, let's say this is what I would do.
02:13 - I would go through this,
02:14 - and I'm like, okay, that
made a lot of sense,
02:16 - that was really great, and then
I would kind of stop coding.
02:21 - I would code for a little bit
longer but then I would stop.
02:24 - What kept happening was I
would code and I would stop.
02:27 - Also, when I tried to go from,
02:29 - and eventually when I
got out of that loop,
02:31 - where I would keep quitting coding.
02:33 - What I would try to do is I
would try to work on a project.
02:36 - So I'd be like, okay, I did
Codecademy tutorial for Python.
02:39 - It was great.
02:40 - I learned the syntax.
02:41 - What's next?
02:42 - So then I tried to work on a project.
02:44 - SO I'll go like okay let me
build a project with Python,
02:52 - only to find out that I have no idea
02:55 - how to go from tutorial
to completed application.
02:59 - And I would have this
big question mark on,
03:02 - what do I do here?
03:03 - So then I would spend some
time trying to make this work
03:06 - but then I would get nowhere with it
03:09 - and then I would feel very
discouraged, disappointed.
03:11 - And I would think this isn't looking good.
03:14 - I'm not making any form of progress
03:15 - that I want to be making.
03:17 - Maybe I missed something in the tutorial?
03:18 - Let me go through the tutorial again.
03:20 - And I would go through
this tutorial again,
03:21 - I would come back to build a project,
03:23 - and I wouldn't be able to build it.
03:24 - Then I would think oh
man it's been so long
03:27 - that I am forgetting commands, alright?
03:29 - So I would also have
this where I felt like
03:32 - I was forgetting if statements, okay?
03:34 - But then if you want to
get more complex with this,
03:36 - I was forgetting how to do a
recursion or how they taught it
03:39 - and I forgot, I'm like maybe it's just,
03:41 - I'm just forgetting code
03:42 - and I'm forgetting the certain
syntax that we're using.
03:44 - How did they use the dictionary
data structure again?
03:47 - How did they use lists again?
03:49 - And I would think, oh, it's
just that I don't remember it.
03:51 - So let me go back and refresh
03:53 - and really just keep on going through it
03:55 - until I figure it out.
03:58 - Very dangerous thing to do
04:00 - because what I ended up discovering
04:01 - was I would spend weeks, months,
04:05 - and I even wasted a year on
just going through tutorials
04:09 - but never make, never feeling
04:11 - like I'm making forward progress.
04:13 - Have you ever had that
happen in your life?
04:15 - Where you were doing this
04:16 - and you found yourself
stuck in a coding loop
04:19 - and you thought either I
can't become a developer.
04:22 - It's too hard or I
can't remember something
04:24 - but basically at the end of the day,
04:26 - you kept finding yourself
in a loop similar to this.
04:30 - That happens.
04:31 - That has happened to me.
04:32 - And maybe that's happened to you.
04:33 - So this is what we call
a tutorial purgatory.
04:35 - It's actually a pretty popular concept.
04:37 - It's very fascinating
04:38 - and there are lots of
videos on this as well.
04:40 - But now what is the solution?
04:43 - What is the solution?
04:47 - Alright?
04:49 - What is it?
04:49 - What's the solution?
04:51 - How do we actually (clicks
tongue) take care of this
04:53 - tutorial purgatory problem?
04:55 - And if you watched my last few videos,
04:58 - I think if you watch even my last one
05:00 - which is day five of this video challenge
05:02 - that I'm doing daily and
I think it was called
05:05 - how to think about coding
problems and solve them.
05:07 - I'mma pop it up right here.
05:09 - That video goes into a lot of
detail on how to solve this.
05:12 - So definitely check
that video out as well.
05:14 - But we're gonna also
dive into that concept.
05:17 - The reason why you keep being stuck
05:19 - in this tutorial purgatory
05:21 - and you can't get out of it
05:23 - is because you aren't
working intentionally.
05:28 - Alright?
05:29 - You are not learning, 'kay?
05:31 - You have to do something
called active learning.
05:37 - And because it's a good thing
I will put a green check mark
05:42 - on this guy.
(bell dinging)
05:43 - What most people are doing is
what we call passive learning.
05:51 - Alright?
05:51 - And this is not just about learning, guys,
05:53 - this is about how you become a developer.
05:55 - This about how you can make an income.
05:58 - 40,000.
05:59 - 50,000.
06:00 - $60,000 a year.
06:01 - 80,000.
06:02 - 100,000.
06:02 - Whatever your goal is.
06:03 - But it also depends on
where you're living,
06:05 - the cost of living, all those things,
06:06 - but with all that in consideration,
06:08 - you're trying to become a developer
06:10 - that's getting paid
what he or she is worth.
06:12 - Coding, the biggest
skill you need in coding
06:15 - to actually be very
successful is your ability
06:17 - to learn new things,
to learn new languages,
06:20 - and new frame words, new
tools, new strategies,
06:23 - new kinds of ways to solve any problem.
06:25 - So, it's not about what you actually know,
06:27 - it's about your skill of learning
06:30 - and if you're fast,
06:31 - if you figure out how to learn new things
06:33 - fast in coding, you're gonna always have
06:35 - a career in programming and coding.
06:37 - So this goes really deep.
06:39 - This is why you might not
be a developer right now.
06:42 - This is why you might not
be at the level you want
06:44 - to be at right now.
06:45 - So we're gonna put a red X.
(buzzer buzzing)
06:49 - Don't do passive learning.
06:51 - Passive learning is what's causing you
06:53 - to be stuck in tutorial purgatory.
06:56 - You're gonna be stuck
in tutorial purgatory
06:58 - for the rest of your life
06:59 - and you'll never feel like
you're good at programming.
07:02 - You will always feel like
that imposter syndrome,
07:05 - that you're kind of just
faking it and going further,
07:07 - and you will always have this feeling
07:08 - where you spent years coding, months,
07:10 - or maybe even a year or two,
07:12 - but you'll feel and you
can see that other person
07:15 - who's only been doing
it less times than you
07:17 - might actually be better than you.
07:19 - Alright?
07:20 - And this is the reason
why this takes place.
07:22 - Why tutorial purgatory takes place
07:24 - is because of passive learning.
07:25 - A very horrible thing to do, okay?
07:27 - So let me talk about what
passive learning looks like.
07:29 - It is just going through the motions
07:31 - and you're copying the code
07:33 - and you're practicing and
you're kind of learning it,
07:35 - but it's a form of passive learning.
07:38 - What active learning would look like is,
07:41 - let's say that I want to learn how to,
07:46 - let's say that I'm trying
to build a project, okay?
07:49 - Let's say I have a project in mind.
07:50 - And I've talked about this
in one of my older videos.
07:53 - But let's say I have a project in mind
07:54 - and I want to create some kind of app.
07:57 - There's some kind of application.
07:58 - So think I want to make
a app like Instagram.
08:02 - If I want to make a app like Instagram,
08:04 - first of all, what are,
08:05 - what is one thing I might need?
08:07 - If people are making posts, right?
08:09 - They put up their pictures
and it saves somewhere.
08:12 - I need to have a place
that could save the data.
08:14 - So then every time I run my
code, my data can be there.
08:18 - So I need to be able to
save my data somehow.
08:20 - So I would know, okay, I'm trying to,
08:22 - I'm starting this project.
08:24 - It's gonna be kinda like an Instagram app.
08:26 - So one feature I need, I
would take the Instagram app,
08:29 - and break it into its component parts.
08:31 - So it has the ability to save data,
08:33 - it has the ability to read, write,
08:35 - delete data, and edit data.
08:37 - In web development, we call it CRUD.
08:39 - Create, read, update and delete,
08:40 - okay, so it has CRUD, it's CRUD enabled.
08:42 - And then it has lots of different features
08:45 - so you can edit a post,
you can write on a post,
08:49 - it'll save everything for you, right,
08:51 - and everybody has their own accounts.
08:52 - Let's just start with a simple thing.
08:54 - So it saves, let's just
say it saves stuff.
08:58 - Alright?
08:59 - That's one ability that is has.
09:00 - Then so you are like okay?
09:02 - I want to be able to save stuff.
09:03 - Then what is another thing that could be
09:05 - a simple thing you could
build into your app?
09:07 - Well, what if you want in your app
09:10 - to have a feature to be
able to search people?
09:13 - Okay?
09:13 - You want to be able to
search on Instagram,
09:15 - you can type in my name, CleverQazi,
09:17 - and that will search me up.
09:19 - How do you build that functionality
to search somebody up?
09:21 - You need something like filtering.
09:23 - Or searching.
09:23 - So I would write down okay
I need to filter and search.
09:28 - Alright.
09:29 - So now these are two
features I am thinking about
09:33 - that I'm gonna have in my project.
09:34 - So I have this project
that I'm working on,
09:37 - maybe I've already started,
09:38 - and even if I haven't started it,
09:40 - I have a project in mind.
09:42 - I have a project in mind.
09:44 - Like a Instagram clone I wanna make.
09:46 - Now when I learn, and in Codecademy,
09:48 - let's say they're teaching
me about CSV files.
09:51 - I don't have enough room to
write, so I'll write here.
09:54 - But if they're teaching about CSV files,
09:56 - all of a sudden that stuff
is way more interesting.
10:00 - And will remain in my brain.
10:01 - The reason is because CSV
files are like these, you know,
10:05 - comma separated values, in other words,
10:07 - you can do stuff like Excel
stuff with CSV files, right.
10:09 - So think of that Excel file.
10:11 - So basically now with your program,
10:13 - in your Python, you can save
data to some kind of file.
10:16 - So now you've learned.
10:18 - Before you would read,
reading and writing CSV files.
10:21 - Like that sounds so lame and boring.
10:23 - Unless I'm a financial
analyst, never gonna be useful.
10:26 - But now you're thinking,
10:27 - oh, this is giving me the
ability to save stuff.
10:30 - That means that I can
do this functionality
10:33 - when I am ready to work on my app.
10:36 - I can have the saves stuff functionality.
10:39 - Okay?
10:40 - So now it's kind of
like having a database.
10:42 - Okay, this is what we call a database.
10:43 - So like, oh, that's amazing.
10:45 - Then the next thing
you're thinking about is,
10:46 - and you go okay.
10:48 - How can I filter and search?
10:49 - You're actively thinking about it, right.
10:50 - So in Codecademy, maybe if
they teach you how to write
10:52 - a function in Python that
teaches you how to filter stuff
10:56 - or find stuff, like you know
you'll write this function,
10:58 - it's like find the maximum in
the list or find the minimum.
11:01 - Now it's not just this random exercise,
11:03 - you're doing in a void in isolation.
11:07 - You are actually doing this
exercise for a bigger reason.
11:11 - Because you're thinking, oh, if I can find
11:13 - the biggest thing in a list
11:14 - and the shortest thing in a list,
11:16 - then it means I know how to find things
11:18 - which means I can sort my,
11:21 - I can have people sort by
who has the most followers.
11:24 - I can have my app sort
11:25 - by who has the least amount of followers.
11:27 - Oh.
11:28 - So this can be really useful.
11:29 - And if I figure out how
to search like this,
11:32 - then maybe I can even build a
search functionality, right,
11:35 - because it's teaching
you how to filter stuff.
11:37 - So you can be like, okay,
cool, so I can filter stuff
11:40 - and then I can have search functionality.
11:43 - So now when you're learning
the filtering section,
11:46 - that was supposed to be super,
11:47 - you know just dry, it's just
teaching you that one thing.
11:50 - You have this active project
you're thinking about.
11:52 - And you're thinking about,
oh, I'm gonna apply it.
11:54 - And then as soon as
you learn these things,
11:56 - you actually apply it in your own project.
11:58 - Alright.
11:59 - In your own app, your own project.
12:01 - It could be something very simple.
12:03 - It could be a Hello World
app and a script, alright.
12:05 - It doesn't need to be something fancy
12:07 - with the front end and everything
12:08 - because if you're a beginner,
12:09 - you're not gonna know how
to do web development.
12:11 - You're not gonna know how
to deploy stuff online
12:13 - and you're probably not
gonna know how Jangle words,
12:15 - but you can still do stuff
on your local computer.
12:17 - If you're thinking about a bigger picture,
12:19 - a project you have in mind, a vision,
12:21 - then it becomes way more exciting
12:23 - but most importantly you're now doing
12:25 - (bell ringing)
active learning.
12:26 - It's not lazy learning.
12:27 - It's active learning.
12:29 - And once you can do active learning,
12:31 - the magic that will happen, my friend,
12:33 - is that you will never,
ever, ever be stuck
12:38 - in tutorial purgatory ever again.
12:41 - (light hip-hop music)
12:43 - This was my message for this video.
12:44 - Thank you so much for watching.
12:46 - As always, I love your face
12:48 - and I will see you in the next video!
