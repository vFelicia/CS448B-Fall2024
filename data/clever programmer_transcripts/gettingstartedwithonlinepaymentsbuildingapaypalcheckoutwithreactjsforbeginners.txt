04:09 - projects in multiple parts because they
04:12 - are so
04:13 - big and so heavy so
04:16 - yeah let's get into it all right uh fubu
04:19 - mtb
04:19 - says the air table doesn't work let me
04:21 - check that that would be bonkers
04:24 - that would that would be a problem
04:28 - uh okay let me see let me see
04:35 - for me it does work i mean it seems like
04:38 - it it works
04:40 - yes it does work it is only one question
04:43 - uh nope this is not firebase this is
04:47 - literally a few lines of code guys this
04:49 - is
04:50 - the simple easiest way that you can get
04:53 - started and checking out people and
04:55 - charging people's card
04:57 - the reason i actually built this one is
05:00 - that
05:01 - many of you asked what's the easiest way
05:04 - to
05:04 - get started with an e-commerce app and
05:07 - one of them being
05:08 - is being okay with importing
05:11 - multiple stuff into your application
05:13 - stacking them on top of that
05:16 - and then doing something amazing now
05:18 - payment is actually
05:19 - something that that is a very big deal
05:24 - in the customer's eye you know they want
05:26 - to
05:27 - uh they want to have their
05:30 - money in a safe place right so you don't
05:33 - want to just
05:34 - put out your credit card number wherever
05:37 - so that way
05:38 - um that way you i
05:41 - always want to use some sort of
05:43 - third-party
05:44 - something uh some of them some stores
05:47 - usually use stripe uh some people
05:51 - actually uh are you are your sign
05:54 - in the works nope it does it does no
05:57 - what
05:58 - guys this does work what are you say
06:02 - hey it does work let me show you let me
06:05 - show you
06:07 - all right so new tab pasting the link
06:12 - from the description
06:21 - all right let's see let's see no it does
06:23 - open
06:24 - guys this is it this is how it should
06:27 - look like
06:30 - see like this is the simplest form
06:34 - that you will ever see whatever you want
06:36 - just pop it in there like say
06:38 - yo yo david
06:41 - i want to build
06:46 - an e-commerce
06:50 - store submit
06:53 - that's it that's all hey
06:57 - colombia latin america
07:00 - latin america
07:04 - that's that was all my spanish all right
07:07 - anyways let's get started with today's
07:11 - build
07:12 - uh john
07:16 - that's amazing all right so guys
07:19 - it is in a public mode guys this should
07:21 - be working this
07:22 - is the simplest one question form you
07:24 - will ever see
07:25 - in your life so yeah
07:29 - all right so this is the simplest paypal
07:32 - app that you will ever
07:33 - see this is nothing crazy you can
07:35 - literally
07:36 - pay with your uh credit card and it will
07:39 - just pop you
07:40 - onto a new website you will just go
07:43 - ahead
07:44 - fill in whatever details you might have
07:46 - and then just go
07:47 - back and then and that's it like once
07:50 - you hit continue it actually it doesn't
07:52 - charge anything because it's uh
07:53 - in in sandbox mode you can see it up
07:56 - here uh
07:58 - but once you change the credentials to
08:00 - live mode
08:02 - it will actually start charging people
08:04 - so
08:05 - that's why i'm saying that this is super
08:07 - simple so let's get started let's start
08:09 - building this
08:10 - and by the way guys if you're interested
08:13 - in this and if you're enjoying these
08:15 - lives and if you
08:16 - think you will get value out of it make
08:18 - sure to go ahead smash that like button
08:20 - down below for that youtube algorithm
08:22 - because it actually helps you become a
08:23 - better developer
08:25 - okay might not but 5 am in south korea
08:29 - but i wait for the class sleep doesn't
08:31 - matter
08:31 - that's what's up that's what i'm talking
08:33 - about
08:35 - all right so with that said
08:40 - uh i'm just gonna go ahead and go back
08:42 - in here
08:43 - i'll have it this open on this side
08:46 - close this window because i don't need
08:48 - this
08:48 - and guys by the way start dropping
08:51 - questions down below in the comments
08:52 - because
08:53 - the uh i'm gonna be answering a few of
08:55 - those while the
08:56 - create react app script is running so
09:00 - let's get to let's go ahead and i'm just
09:02 - gonna go ahead and type in
09:03 - uh npx create
09:07 - react app space
09:10 - dot and let's wait a little so guys
09:14 - right now it is your chance to get your
09:17 - question answered
09:18 - make sure to drop it in the comment
09:19 - section down below i wanna see all of
09:22 - them
09:22 - what's up how are you guys doing
09:27 - at work but couldn't miss it
09:31 - okay so let's wait a little
09:35 - for that react app to create itself
09:38 - what's up when is the next build it is
09:41 - going to be tomorrow
09:43 - okay volume is too too low once again
09:45 - what
09:46 - dude come on should be good now
09:52 - you know what i just put this up a
09:54 - little like a proper full fledge build
09:57 - yes we are actually going to be
09:59 - delivering big
10:01 - projects like big big project
10:04 - like and we are going to be delivering
10:06 - them in multiple parts just so you guys
10:08 - can
10:08 - understand it better and have uh more
10:11 - time to pro
10:12 - process it okay we'll go through the
10:15 - basic
10:16 - uh this is the bay most basic checkout
10:19 - you will ever
10:19 - see paypal has made it super super easy
10:23 - uh to implement their checkout and by
10:25 - the way guys if you've done the amazon
10:27 - clone
10:28 - you can pretty much go ahead and put it
10:30 - in there okay
10:33 - um do you think mirn is the best thing
10:37 - to learn
10:37 - if i want to become a full stack
10:39 - developer
10:40 - um i would say if you want to be a full
10:44 - stack web developer
10:45 - yes mirn is a pretty solid choice
10:48 - volume is too high now guys come on
10:52 - okay it's clipping now geez
10:55 - okay how about how about now it
10:57 - shouldn't be clipping now
11:00 - everything stays in the i mean it's yeah
11:03 - it's it shouldn't be clipping yeah uh
11:09 - so yes mirn is a pretty solid choice
11:12 - just because of the fact that it is
11:14 - super
11:14 - popular plus mongodb is a great choice
11:16 - anyways
11:18 - what's up greece anastasios from greece
11:22 - uh so yeah and and marine is a pretty
11:26 - solid choice because it uses react
11:27 - mongodb node.js
11:29 - express.js so 100 i can just
11:32 - um approve that so go for it
11:35 - but stick with it and also learn
11:37 - firebase on the side
11:39 - because it just uh helps you a ton with
11:42 - time management and all that stuff okay
11:44 - sound is better what is the best
11:46 - programming language for the back-end
11:48 - development
11:48 - uh i would option one say node.js
11:52 - option b say python but kazi would say
11:55 - option one
11:56 - python so yes uh
11:59 - and am i using an m1 mac
12:02 - not yet but it's actually in the process
12:06 - uh is it like instacart honestly i don't
12:09 - know
12:10 - instacart um from the name i just don't
12:13 - trust them
12:13 - with my money so yeah
12:18 - why not my sequel instead of mongodb in
12:20 - mir i mean
12:22 - you can go with my sequel as well i just
12:25 - prefer the nosql world
12:28 - okay
12:34 - all right with that said let's jump
12:36 - straight into it
12:38 - let's build that uh paypal because my
12:41 - react app is now
12:42 - up and running so with that said i'm
12:45 - just gonna open up a vs code on the
12:48 - wrong screen
12:49 - [Music]
12:51 - and move this terminal
12:54 - away we're not going to need it anymore
12:57 - i mean
12:57 - actually yes we do so uh
13:01 - guys let me open up a quick
13:06 - virtualization of this react app so i'm
13:08 - just going to say yarn start
13:09 - and hopefully it will open up on this
13:13 - side of the window and we are actually
13:17 - going to be getting started right now so
13:19 - make sure
13:20 - you have your react app open and ready
13:23 - and you are ready to build this with me
13:26 - right now so guys actually just just so
13:29 - you know
13:29 - to get the biggest roi of this training
13:34 - is highly highly advised that you go
13:36 - ahead and uh
13:37 - build this with me and code along okay
13:40 - so and it might not make sense at the
13:43 - very first time but make sure to
13:45 - watch it once again and by the way it is
13:47 - amazing to see that we almost have 150
13:50 - people live
13:51 - that's super amazing i'm super thankful
13:54 - for that
13:54 - and with that said let's get started
13:57 - what's up ronnie how's it going
14:00 - all right so going back to my vs code
14:02 - i'm just going to zoom in a little
14:04 - so you guys can see it better what's uh
14:06 - what i'm doing and maybe even do
14:09 - this so there's a little more space for
14:11 - that
14:12 - and i'm just going to get started with
14:15 - my uh
14:16 - usual um
14:19 - cleanup process i think so basically
14:22 - everything from app.css goes away
14:24 - i'm not going to have any kind of test
14:28 - files so app.test.js
14:30 - is actually now gone
14:33 - which takes quite some time for some
14:35 - reason
14:36 - uh logo svg can go as well
14:40 - setup test.js can go as well we are not
14:42 - going to use
14:43 - any of those index.css i'm just going to
14:47 - on the top add a star basically tag
14:50 - all those uh basically tag everything
14:54 - inside of the index.js file
14:57 - and add a margin of zero
15:00 - onto it so basically everything is going
15:03 - to be stretched out
15:04 - all the way till the very side of the
15:06 - screen
15:07 - now going into app.js uh
15:11 - inside of header everything is going
15:14 - away
15:15 - uh this is just the basic react app that
15:19 - we had before
15:20 - and right now we should see this clean
15:24 - white nothing if it makes sense
15:27 - all right so with that said let's take a
15:30 - look at how can we have all these
15:32 - buttons over here
15:34 - so for that we're just gonna go ahead
15:35 - and google a little bit
15:37 - so we will be going ahead and search up
15:40 - google
15:41 - not google jesus paypal check out
15:45 - api okay super simple super easy okay
15:50 - and you just kind of want to go to some
15:53 - sort of developer.paypal.com
15:56 - and and then basically just let's see
15:58 - what they have
15:59 - uh does this use react paypal gs no it
16:02 - doesn't
16:03 - uh i'm not using any sort of
16:06 - third-party uh npm package in this one
16:10 - i'm just using plain react and all that
16:13 - okay all right let's take a look at what
16:16 - we have here so we have this get started
16:19 - uh i just want to go into the paypal
16:21 - developer
16:22 - and log in to my dashboard now guys
16:25 - because i already have a paypal account
16:28 - i can just quickly log in
16:30 - if you do not have one make sure to
16:32 - right now is the time for you to sign up
16:34 - for
16:35 - paypal this is a free service by the way
16:38 - it's made by elon musk
16:40 - so if he tweets about it and you have
16:42 - some sort of
16:43 - shares in paypal it will just go stonks
16:47 - and so yeah how can i undo the styled
16:50 - component
16:51 - uh if you've installed the node module
16:54 - you can basically go into package.json
16:56 - remove that line
16:57 - and then uh delete all the node modules
17:00 - and then just do
17:01 - a npm install or yarn install
17:06 - now wha i hope you guys are now ready
17:10 - and inside of paypal developer dashboard
17:12 - so now what i'm going to do
17:14 - is just click this uh
17:19 - just click this create app it's
17:22 - basically you can just add a new
17:23 - application into it
17:25 - this will go ahead and generate you some
17:27 - sort of
17:28 - keys and all that kind of stuff so i'm
17:31 - just gonna name it
17:32 - uh i don't know check out
17:36 - live training
17:42 - looks good uh you wanna select merchant
17:45 - and whatever sort of sandbox business
17:48 - account that you have
17:50 - is going to be good so you don't have to
17:52 - worry about any of those
17:54 - if you don't have it just make sure to
17:55 - create one and you will be good to go
17:59 - all right so let's go ahead and create
18:01 - the app it will spin around for a little
18:05 - jesus sorry the page you are
18:08 - looking for is not found okay guys i'll
18:10 - make sure
18:11 - uh i have a new air table or some sort
18:14 - of form
18:15 - after the live so stick around for like
18:17 - five to ten minutes i will create a
18:19 - new form maybe in google forms or
18:22 - something more
18:23 - uh reliable and you guys can just drop
18:26 - whatever you have there okay
18:28 - what's up hamza
18:31 - okay
18:36 - all right so guys this is basically like
18:38 - once you create the application
18:40 - this is uh what you will see uh
18:44 - this is pretty much just a sandbox
18:46 - account like uh
18:48 - yeah you will have the sandbox account
18:50 - here the email address
18:51 - you always want to go with sandbox
18:54 - because that way
18:55 - will not actually charge your cards
18:58 - now you want to save this client id
19:01 - and then you want to go ahead and
19:05 - have the client secret somewhere secret
19:09 - so with that said
19:12 - what we are going to be doing now is go
19:15 - once again
19:18 - once again go into paypal
19:21 - check out api we're just going to go
19:24 - ahead and
19:25 - search it up on google and what you want
19:28 - now to have is i think this one the
19:31 - payments api
19:33 - so that's basically what we are going to
19:35 - be using and by the way
19:37 - if you are not okay with googling stuff
19:39 - on uh
19:41 - when you are working as a developer
19:43 - that's a problem
19:45 - you always should be uh going ahead
19:48 - and checking out whatever is available
19:52 - online okay
19:55 - so
20:00 - all right let's see what we have here
20:04 - and
20:10 - what do we got what do we got okay
20:19 - so this is basically standard payments
20:21 - what's up daniel thank you where
20:23 - so much i highly highly appreciate this
20:26 - super chat
20:27 - you're an amazing person and we really
20:29 - appreciate uh that you're here and
20:32 - dropping these donations
20:36 - uh yes it actually can be this simple
20:40 - the reason i am doing this live and
20:42 - showing you guys that this is
20:44 - this simple and anybody can do it
20:47 - and you can pretty much just build this
20:50 - thing
20:50 - and put it into your e-commerce app
20:54 - probably there is a little bit more of
20:55 - an authorization of all that kind of
20:57 - stuff
20:58 - but everything is written down here and
21:00 - if you follow it just like we will do it
21:02 - today
21:04 - then you can go ahead and build yourself
21:06 - an e-commerce app
21:09 - and yes i am using a mac all right
21:12 - so once you're here on the standard
21:14 - payments with single
21:16 - page applications that's the one that
21:18 - you're actually looking for
21:20 - then you can pretty much go ahead and
21:23 - have all these things imported
21:25 - now because paypal uses cdn
21:29 - uh we will be going ahead and importing
21:32 - it
21:32 - this way okay so when i go ahead and
21:36 - grab this first one okay so
21:40 - uh there is actually two way that you
21:42 - can go ahead and check out somebody on
21:45 - your store
21:46 - one is if you render the button
21:48 - immediately and the other one
21:50 - is if you have it as if it uh the render
21:53 - like after the user user takes action or
21:56 - the page changes okay how long does this
21:59 - course take
22:00 - it's going to be less than an hour uh
22:03 - we are probably going to be wrapping it
22:05 - up in half an hour or something like
22:07 - that
22:08 - all right it's super simple that's the
22:10 - reason
22:12 - all right so uh first so you want to go
22:15 - ahead and grab
22:16 - this line of code
22:19 - uh and then just go ahead and oh my god
22:24 - i misclicked so once you have that cdn
22:28 - code
22:29 - this one here you want to go into public
22:32 - folder
22:33 - index.html and then just somewhere in
22:37 - between those metas you want to drop
22:38 - that
22:39 - okay so once you have that you see that
22:42 - your
22:42 - sandbox client id is actually missing
22:46 - okay this thing you will need to replace
22:50 - it
22:50 - with your stuff that you just like the
22:53 - application
22:54 - that you just registered so let's go
22:56 - back in here
22:57 - and this is the thing that you want to
22:59 - go ahead and copy
23:02 - copy there okay that's what i want to do
23:08 - what's up mark yeah i like turtles i
23:11 - like turtles too
23:12 - amazing thank you so much really
23:13 - appreciate it what's up morocco
23:15 - what are what am i making uh i'm showing
23:18 - you guys once a heck once again
23:20 - this is the application that i'm making
23:21 - it's a super simple way that you can go
23:24 - ahead and build a paypal checkout
23:26 - and you can just pretty much use
23:28 - whichever link
23:29 - and it is functional um
23:33 - so you can just yeah i i could i could
23:36 - sign in with my own paypal and then
23:38 - use that to pay the amount but
23:41 - instead uh i can even go ahead and pay
23:43 - with debit or credit card and the good
23:45 - thing it is not
23:46 - embedded in your site which actually
23:48 - creates trust
23:49 - between you and your client okay
23:53 - all right and once i'm done with that i
23:55 - just fill everything out hit continue
23:57 - and that's it
23:58 - so that's what we are building today now
24:00 - uh you want to grab this client id over
24:02 - here
24:03 - and then replace this
24:07 - boom just like that and once you're done
24:10 - with that you're pretty much cool with
24:11 - the index.html file
24:14 - you don't need to worry about that uh at
24:17 - all
24:18 - and i hope the zoom is good
24:22 - actually let me let me zoom in a little
24:23 - more so
24:26 - basically that is this is the reason why
24:28 - we are not actually going to be
24:29 - importing any sort of
24:31 - party npm package because we get it done
24:34 - with the cdn all right going back to the
24:37 - documentation if you actually start
24:41 - scrolling down the first one
24:42 - is going to be a react now you can
24:45 - pretty much go ahead and grab
24:47 - all of these things now you might be
24:50 - thinking that you don't need to import
24:52 - react from react yes you do
24:54 - because the paypal button down here
24:57 - is actually directly going to be using
25:00 - that all right
25:01 - so once you have this three lines of
25:03 - code
25:07 - bank then you're pretty much good to go
25:11 - for uh for this okay so far rook says
25:14 - there is some sort of lag which is not
25:17 - good
25:18 - okay let me see let me see
25:27 - okay let's let's see what's up and how
25:30 - is the stream
25:31 - doing
25:38 - all right we should be good shouldn't be
25:42 - shouldn't be messing up let me actually
25:46 - pause this i am some synchronization
25:50 - going on in the background but
25:51 - okay now we should be good to go and
25:58 - all right now we should be good to go
26:00 - let me see how is it
26:01 - uh doing okay uh guys once again
26:05 - i will take care of the form don't worry
26:08 - about that
26:10 - hey thank you so much daniel uh
26:13 - all right
26:18 - okay we should be good let's see let's
26:21 - see how
26:22 - how is the stream doing um
26:29 - okay there should be no more lag anymore
26:32 - uh
26:32 - we are actually live and even youtube
26:36 - says
26:36 - that the stream is good
26:40 - and all right okay
26:44 - i don't have a paypal account uh i'm
26:47 - from pakistan i don't have paypal
26:48 - account
26:49 - um can you actually register if it's not
26:52 - available in your region
26:53 - that is completely okay we actually have
26:56 - a few different
26:57 - options i'm not going to cover those
26:59 - today but
27:00 - i am actually going to uh go over all of
27:03 - them in for
27:04 - in future videos so we have strive we
27:06 - have square
27:08 - and we have paypal this is the three of
27:10 - the uh
27:11 - of those checkout services that i
27:12 - actually trust with my money
27:14 - and i would actually trust uh as a
27:17 - customer
27:19 - so we all we are gonna go ahead and use
27:22 - all of that okay all right
27:27 - going back
27:32 - which one do i use i'll i go
27:35 - uh actually yesterday i published a
27:38 - video
27:39 - uh with my vs code extensions
27:43 - and it's there so make sure to check it
27:44 - out
27:46 - yeah all right so next up what we are
27:49 - going to be doing
27:50 - is you see that all of these is uh
27:55 - all of these are wrote in class-based
27:59 - components now on this channel we pretty
28:01 - much just
28:02 - work with functional components so we
28:04 - are not going to worry about
28:05 - that at all but uh we can go ahead and
28:09 - grab
28:10 - this piece which is actually going to be
28:12 - the paypal button
28:13 - okay so if we put it in here uh
28:16 - it might go ahead and freak out right
28:18 - now because
28:19 - uh we just don't have a lot of things
28:23 - defined just yet but
28:26 - let's remove this and
28:30 - by the way this is actually a super
28:31 - valuable skill that you can
28:33 - uh turn a class-based component into a
28:37 - functional one so this is something that
28:39 - companies are paying for
28:41 - a ton so you can just put it on your
28:43 - resume
28:44 - basically you just go ahead and delete
28:46 - the um
28:49 - this words all right
28:53 - which is awesome and now what we are
28:56 - going to be doing
28:57 - is uh you see that we have this
29:00 - create order and create an unapproved
29:03 - uh files okay um what do you what do i
29:07 - think about patreon clone
29:08 - we can do that drop it in the air table
29:11 - down below
29:12 - so we have these two functions which are
29:14 - at this moment
29:15 - not defined at all but we are just going
29:18 - to go ahead and
29:20 - uh step by step copy paste them and turn
29:24 - them into
29:24 - functionals okay so we have the on
29:28 - approve and that
29:32 - looks almost good but since this is once
29:34 - again
29:35 - class-based components we have to
29:37 - transform them
29:38 - into functional ones so we're just gonna
29:41 - type in
29:42 - const right before them
29:45 - and we have this equal sign over here
29:49 - and the arrow right there so guys
29:52 - again let me see
29:59 - so guys once again uh what we are doing
30:02 - here
30:03 - is step number one creating a paypal
30:06 - application
30:07 - and step number two transforming the
30:09 - class-based components into functional
30:11 - ones
30:12 - so you have more things that you can put
30:14 - on your portfolio
30:16 - all right let me see
30:19 - all the chat what's going on and the
30:21 - live stream health
30:23 - looks good all right amazing
30:28 - and next up
30:34 - okay i see university classes are
30:36 - preventing you from doing these awesome
30:38 - projects don't worry about that
30:39 - this video will stay on this channel
30:41 - forever you can come back and watch it
30:44 - later
30:45 - what do i think pop on the website come
30:47 - please uh
30:48 - i don't know about that okay and
30:51 - next up we have the create order
30:54 - function over here
30:57 - which is yeah i can just go ahead and
30:59 - paste that here as well
31:01 - and again this is going to freak out
31:03 - because this is class based
31:06 - once again not an arrow function
31:11 - and now we uh syntactically we are
31:14 - good okay so at this point in time
31:18 - we should have a functional working
31:22 - uh functional working something
31:26 - however this is still freaking out
31:28 - because paypal
31:29 - is not defined which is on the line five
31:33 - okay
31:33 - so this is the thing that it is freaking
31:36 - out about
31:37 - uh let me see and the reason is that
31:40 - we are trying to use a let me show
31:44 - let me let me explain what's happening
31:45 - here so we are trying to use a package
31:47 - that is not
31:48 - being imported on this screen on the
31:51 - component
31:51 - right so when we say import paypal from
31:54 - paypal or react from react or something
31:56 - like that
31:56 - or like i don't know button from
31:58 - material ui that means that
32:00 - we actually installed that certain
32:02 - package to the whole
32:03 - application and we are importing it to
32:05 - the component
32:06 - however because we are right now
32:08 - importing it
32:09 - as a cdn so inside of the index.html
32:13 - file
32:13 - that means we will need to add in one
32:16 - more word which is called
32:18 - window so that way it is not going to
32:21 - worry about
32:22 - uh how the
32:26 - so it is not going to worry about uh the
32:30 - what do you say uh component instead it
32:32 - is going to wait
32:33 - until everything is going to be rendered
32:36 - and then use the cdn that imported it
32:40 - all right so let's take a look at how we
32:42 - do that
32:45 - and what we would just say instead of
32:48 - freaking out
32:49 - is just say window space dot
32:52 - and yes i can make a youtube chrome and
32:54 - guys this is pretty much
32:56 - it like we legit have a paypal checkout
33:00 - right now this was this fast and it is
33:03 - right now functional so let's first
33:05 - actually make it look
33:07 - good not this ugly thing so for that
33:10 - what we are going to do is add in a
33:14 - like change it to the bomb naming
33:15 - convention and add
33:17 - a wrapper
33:20 - oh dang i made a typo
33:27 - go down here close the other one
33:30 - and what i what i went ahead and what i
33:32 - did by the way
33:33 - over here is that i have the application
33:35 - uh with the background color of gray and
33:37 - the
33:38 - wrapper uh with uh some sort of
33:41 - light grayish color so basically that's
33:43 - literally what i'm gonna do
33:45 - so i will have app which is going to
33:47 - have a width
33:48 - of a 100 view height uh height
33:52 - jesus 100 view
33:55 - width like that height of 100 view
33:59 - height
34:02 - add a background color of gray
34:07 - and a display of grid now
34:11 - once this is done oh also we actually
34:13 - want to add a
34:14 - place items
34:19 - center so right now
34:22 - everything is centered what's up
34:24 - indonesia how's it going
34:26 - and yes i can make a youtube clone from
34:29 - react.js
34:30 - uh actually drop me a text
34:34 - uh where's my overlays window hold on
34:45 - hold on a sec
34:51 - guys go ahead uh drop a message to me uh
34:54 - what you want me to build next
34:55 - if the air table is not working for you
34:58 - i just dropped my instagram handle on
35:00 - the screen um
35:02 - and yeah with that said let's continue
35:05 - all right and right now
35:06 - uh i'm just gonna add a little bit of
35:09 - style to the wrapper as well
35:13 - so that will have a background color of
35:15 - light
35:16 - gray
35:19 - just like that add a padding
35:22 - of 100 pixels and a
35:26 - border radius of
35:29 - 10 pixels
35:32 - and we pretty much have this nice look
35:34 - so let's go ahead test it out
35:36 - so i'm first going to go ahead and click
35:38 - paypal
35:39 - and see what's happening and by the way
35:42 - i'm just gonna open this up
35:43 - open oops hold on i'm just gonna open up
35:46 - the console
35:47 - down here so i see what's going on
35:49 - what's up germany
35:51 - and right now as you can see i'm logged
35:54 - into paypal so that's amazing
35:56 - and where i can log into paypal so
35:59 - that's amazing
36:00 - and i can go ahead and pay with my debit
36:02 - card or something
36:03 - now this is an important part so
36:06 - uh so you see the paypal guest checkout
36:09 - is
36:09 - on and everything is working perfectly
36:13 - now i want to show you guys a few
36:14 - different things that how you can
36:17 - charge the person a certain amount that
36:20 - you want to go ahead and charge them
36:22 - so basically if you were to implement
36:24 - this to a
36:26 - random oh my god
36:30 - so if you were to implement this
36:32 - specific checkout to
36:34 - your um to your e-commerce application
36:40 - i'm not doing microsoft stuff i'm sorry
36:43 - about that
36:44 - okay maybe i maybe i'll do it so
36:48 - what i will do here is i can like pretty
36:51 - much you can
36:51 - replace this 0.01
36:55 - yes it is actually going to be available
36:58 - after
36:58 - i i'm going away so the value
37:02 - you can replace it with whatever number
37:04 - you want and that is the amount of cash
37:07 - that you will be charging the person at
37:10 - you can also go
37:11 - down here and explore what uh what else
37:14 - um
37:17 - what else um
37:21 - like what what are the currencies you
37:23 - want to go ahead and charge
37:24 - other people and you can also fill out
37:27 - their form
37:28 - ahead so once you are in this place uh
37:32 - you can pretty much just pre-fill
37:33 - all the data see you can pretty much
37:36 - pre-fill all the data in there and so
37:39 - that way they will only have to
37:41 - just uh fill in their credit card
37:43 - numbers and they will be good to go
37:45 - okay now i'm gonna once again uh
37:48 - just so you guys see that what is
37:50 - happening here and yes i will make a
37:53 - stripe checkout clone just like this one
37:55 - uh just for the sake that you can go
37:57 - ahead and pretty much just
37:59 - copy this and then put it in your
38:01 - project we will actually cover all those
38:04 - uh checkout uh platforms
38:09 - uh so you can pretty much go ahead and
38:12 - just
38:13 - console log the data that you will get
38:15 - back okay
38:19 - and on approve okay so unapprove
38:22 - we will see what sort of data are we
38:25 - getting back
38:29 - okay so let's let's test it out again
38:32 - so if i if i were to just go ahead and
38:35 - go with the debit and credit card option
38:37 - the last one
38:39 - i can do this so paypal guest checkout
38:42 - that's cool
38:42 - united states card number uh what i like
38:46 - to use is 40 to 40
38:47 - like a lot of 42's and something's up
38:52 - oh okay
38:58 - jeez
39:04 - and then just uh all these sorts of
39:07 - numbers
39:08 - i can add in my name
39:15 - yeah street address i don't know 1180
39:21 - mathers avenue that's good
39:25 - by the way this is a completely
39:26 - fictional address so
39:29 - don't even try to visit me there
39:33 - what's up everybody yes shipping that
39:36 - are the same
39:37 - and then i can just add in some sort of
39:39 - email address that's good
39:44 - don't call me that's not my number and
39:47 - if i go ahead and hit continue
39:48 - it will go ahead load up a little bit
39:51 - and
39:52 - it is actually going to seek seed
39:56 - let's wait for it just for a little
40:04 - let's see so it is right now
40:08 - communicating with the paypal servers
40:10 - and basically just testing out the whole
40:13 - checkout uh functionality and
40:17 - all those data that i put in and right
40:19 - now it's loading so
40:21 - we should be good to go very very soon
40:24 - so guys once again the reason
40:27 - i came live today with this such a small
40:30 - build
40:30 - and such a small uh
40:34 - okay what's up
40:38 - the reason i actually did this live uh
40:40 - with such a
40:42 - short uh
40:46 - in such a short time is that you can
40:48 - pretty much go ahead and
40:50 - uh do the exact same thing okay
40:56 - so again i'm just adding in my number
41:06 - [Music]
41:10 - and that's pretty much it guys like
41:12 - literally you can go ahead and build
41:15 - this
41:15 - whole thing in such a short time and
41:18 - then just focus on the user experience
41:21 - on your store so once again this is your
41:24 - chance to ask me any kind of questions
41:26 - that you might have
41:29 - [Music]
41:32 - in the chat right now
41:50 - new playlist of all your clone videos in
41:52 - react.js in this channel i want to save
41:54 - this
41:55 - in a playlist okay i can do that okay
41:58 - okay
41:59 - this is going to california yep
42:11 - continue let's see how it's going right
42:14 - now
42:16 - so that was it that was the build
42:19 - for today and we should be good to go so
42:22 - guys drop me any kind of questions that
42:24 - you might have
42:26 - uh yes i will continue these live videos
42:29 - i have a
42:29 - it's a good way to go with react front
42:31 - end and eshop
42:33 - i mean mostly because of the seo
42:36 - i would actually go ahead and learn
42:39 - gatsby that has
42:40 - built-in seo and
42:44 - yeah so gatsby has a built-in seo and is
42:47 - actually
42:49 - for the user it's much uh faster because
42:52 - it
42:52 - uses server-side rendering okay
42:56 - so which one do i use what do you mean
43:00 - oh you mean uh are you i use xcode 12
43:03 - theme in vs code
43:17 - it's one o'clock
43:22 - all right so with that said guys um
43:25 - that was it for today we built a super
43:28 - simple
43:29 - paypal checkout you can pretty much go
43:31 - ahead and do the exact same thing
43:33 - just follow along the documentation
43:40 - how do you dynamically set the price
43:42 - okay i'm gonna go ahead and uh
43:45 - show you how can you dynamically set
43:48 - the price so uh we are not going to
43:51 - worry about too much
43:52 - the styling but let's say i have an
43:55 - input here
43:56 - and this is going to be a number
44:01 - and we will say on change we will have
44:04 - an unchange over here
44:06 - and now we'll fire off an even it's just
44:08 - like
44:09 - how you would normally set a variable
44:11 - okay
44:16 - uh so and
44:19 - what you want is you want to have a
44:21 - u-state on here
44:22 - up here
44:26 - boom like that and was just say price
44:31 - and the initial state is going to be
44:35 - zero dollars and you want to select this
44:38 - and then remove this and say price
44:41 - this is going to be price
44:45 - i should learn how to type all right
44:49 - and the value of this one is going to be
44:52 - price once again
44:56 - [Music]
44:58 - and we will have a set price
45:02 - which is going to be e dot target
45:06 - oh boy which is going to e the target
45:10 - value
45:14 - just like that so right now
45:17 - let's refresh this oh boy there's some
45:20 - sort of typo
45:22 - happening here okay let's remove that
45:27 - all right so once again this is uh
45:31 - for nicos
45:36 - this is how you this is how we set uh
45:38 - the price
45:39 - dynamically once again i'm gonna quickly
45:41 - go over
45:43 - what i've just done in the code so again
45:46 - um i've created a use state over here
45:50 - uh called price and i have the set price
45:54 - the initial value is going to be zero
45:57 - obviously
45:58 - and you want to add an input field or
46:00 - something that
46:02 - you will determine the price based on so
