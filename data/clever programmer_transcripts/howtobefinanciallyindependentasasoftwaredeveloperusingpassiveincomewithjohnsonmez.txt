00:00 - let's talk about this what does it mean
00:02 - to be making a hundred thousand dollars
00:04 - a year all of us developers the dream is
00:07 - to make six figures work at a cool
00:09 - company live in San Francisco and just
00:11 - be millionaires right that's it but
00:14 - what's the reality let's talk about it
00:16 - yeah so I mean you know I think the
00:19 - first place you got to start with the
00:20 - reality of this is like where where is
00:23 - it actually gonna take you let's say
00:24 - that you're making that six-figure
00:26 - income you know yeah you could probably
00:29 - live pretty nice in the short term right
00:31 - you can get a nice car get a decent
00:33 - house payment but but where are you
00:35 - gonna be are you actually gonna be able
00:37 - to save a large amount of money are you
00:38 - actually gonna become wealthy are you
00:39 - actually gonna have any kind of passive
00:42 - income because you know the answer is no
00:45 - like like what what are you gonna get
00:47 - left over with after taxes after
00:48 - everything is is done it's not gonna be
00:50 - a whole lot right and if you take that
00:52 - money if you save that money right maybe
00:55 - you can get you can rent a scooter for a
00:58 - couple you know a little bit you know
01:00 - where you're gonna end up you know in
01:01 - ten years twenty years down the road
01:03 - it's not gonna be enough for you to just
01:05 - you know permanently live off of right
01:07 - you're gonna you're not gonna have
01:09 - freedom you might have the job and you
01:10 - don't even know if you're gonna have the
01:11 - job right so what do you think about
01:13 - this I think that there's not much left
01:16 - 130 even if you're making hundred twenty
01:19 - thousand dollars a year and living in
01:20 - San Francisco after all of the taxes get
01:23 - taken out the state the federal after
01:26 - your expenses your rent being thirty
01:28 - forty thousand dollars a year and then
01:30 - you want to live off of something - I
01:32 - feel like your true income is thirty to
01:34 - forty thousand dollars and even that
01:36 - sometimes you might want to buy a car
01:37 - you might want to be going out and you
01:40 - might want to do something you know like
01:41 - traveling so you're not really left with
01:44 - much the money that you can
01:45 - realistically put away at the end of
01:48 - every year would be about I don't know
01:50 - ten thousand dollars twenty thousand
01:52 - dollars which honestly most people don't
01:54 - put away that even that much a year
01:56 - right right so over the course of a
01:58 - decade you would have a hundred thousand
02:00 - dollars left over or less and then what
02:04 - I want you to think about is what would
02:06 - inflation do to it the money that's just
02:09 - there right so
02:11 - I feel like that plan is the old plan of
02:15 - being successful putting someone in 401k
02:18 - and kind of just like hoping and praying
02:20 - and I think in reality when it comes
02:23 - down to you spending ten years or 20
02:25 - years doing this job I feel like you're
02:27 - not gonna be left with the income that
02:29 - you thought right yeah no I'd say also
02:31 - you know then the big thing is like the
02:33 - one thing that you can't get back which
02:35 - is your time right like and that's the
02:37 - thing is it's like yeah you know you you
02:39 - work the job but all that time that
02:41 - you're putting in right a lot of people
02:43 - think of it as putting in the time right
02:45 - they don't really like go to their job
02:46 - because that's what they want to do I
02:48 - mean maybe you start out I mean there's
02:50 - some days you like your job and whatnot
02:51 - but if you're given the choice I guess
02:54 - if they weren't gonna pay you but and
02:57 - you didn't need any money would you go
02:59 - in and do it you know probably not and
03:01 - so what you're thinking about really is
03:03 - like I mean you've got one life you've
03:05 - got so many years you've got your youth
03:07 - only one time yeah and so are you gonna
03:10 - sacrifice you know all that time
03:12 - basically a portion of your life you
03:15 - know a significant portion in order to
03:18 - to do what right to end up with like you
03:20 - said a hundred thousand after ten years
03:21 - I mean you invest the money maybe it's
03:23 - like you know but but the thing that you
03:26 - know what you really need to be able to
03:28 - do is to be able to earn that time is to
03:30 - have the time like how can you basically
03:32 - have more time right because if you were
03:35 - you know on your deathbed you're 90
03:37 - years old how much money would you trade
03:39 - how much would you pay to have one more
03:42 - year of life right everything everything
03:45 - like millions of dollars doesn't matter
03:46 - because all of that money as soon as you
03:48 - die it's it's all it's all worthless
03:50 - right so so that's the thing I think to
03:52 - think about is that like you know we
03:53 - think about making money we think about
03:55 - the kind of the present but if you're
03:57 - going to the regular job if you're
03:59 - putting in those eight hours a day or
04:00 - more you basically train your life right
04:03 - you're trading the time that you can't
04:05 - get back and so you got to find another
04:07 - way you got to find a way how can you
04:09 - have that time how can you buy that time
04:11 - now instead of waiting you know spending
04:14 - all that time and then hopefully someday
04:16 - in the future that you're gonna have you
04:18 - know have more time when we
04:20 - in reality the quality at that time is
04:22 - gonna be less right yeah your best time
04:24 - is when you're when you have the you
04:26 - when you're strong and you're young and
04:28 - you can enjoy the time that you have but
04:29 - yes that's the time that most people are
04:31 - working and on time you're not gonna get
04:34 - time back you can get money back
04:36 - money is a replenishing resource I mean
04:39 - apparently I just learned it yesterday
04:42 - even oil itself replenishable resource
04:44 - after millions of years but time is not
04:48 - time we'll go away right so what are
04:52 - some things that you can do one of the
04:54 - tactical things like specific things
04:56 - that you could do for example is we were
04:58 - speaking with I think somebody asked
05:01 - this question abdullah who's in our
05:02 - webinar yesterday we were doing a live
05:04 - training and he asked he's like hey haha
05:06 - should i hire a mentor would it be
05:08 - beneficial for me to actually hire a
05:10 - mentor or whatever and we thought and i
05:12 - thought about that question i'm like
05:14 - okay let me take a stab at this and I
05:16 - thought okay when I started I was
05:18 - actually hiring lots of mentors and I
05:20 - was using lots of my money to invest in
05:23 - myself to get more skills so for example
05:25 - what I would do is I would go in tutor
05:26 - and I would be making twenty thirty
05:28 - forty dollars an hour and all of that
05:31 - money I would make
05:32 - I'll just reinvest it into a developer
05:34 - who was on a platform like code mentor
05:35 - or something like wise aunt or take
05:38 - lessons or whatever like even in person
05:40 - you could find them and hide them and I
05:43 - would pay them 20 30 40 50 dollars an
05:45 - hour and I would think ok for one hour
05:47 - of my time I get one hour of your time
05:50 - or I get one hour of some incredible
05:53 - developer Sam with five or ten years of
05:54 - experience but the arbitrage that I was
05:57 - doing there was for one month of my
06:01 - experience into coding I'm getting five
06:04 - years of experience of somebody right
06:06 - yeah right that's the game I'm playing
06:08 - and so what was happening was if a
06:10 - developer had ten years of experience
06:12 - and I have zero years but I'm paying him
06:14 - like hundred dollars or a thousand
06:16 - dollars or whatever and he's giving me
06:17 - all his hours I'm thinking I'm
06:19 - accelerating really fast so the more
06:21 - money I'm spending there and the more
06:22 - time he's spending with me I'm going
06:24 - from zero to like like I'm getting to
06:28 - two years of experience in like three
06:30 - months of time two months of time
06:31 - because that knowledge is so
06:34 - specific it's custom it's not like
06:37 - spray-and-pray which I feel like a lot
06:39 - of what school knowledge is that is very
06:41 - specific because he's doing a job he's
06:43 - right there in the world and so I feel
06:45 - that it's almost like being in a time
06:47 - machine you could actually fast-forward
06:49 - time if you reinvest that money into
06:52 - yourself so you know you talked a lot
06:54 - about making a high income skill and
06:57 - then leveraging that I tell people all
06:59 - the time like use that money and I feel
07:01 - like there is a place where our advice
07:03 - actually kind of intersects and it's
07:05 - helpful for people which is I remember
07:07 - asking about when is a good time to
07:09 - invest into something like real estate
07:10 - how much money should you have you like
07:12 - have twenty thousand dollars so I'm like
07:14 - what should you do before twenty
07:15 - thousand dollars and you said invest in
07:17 - yourself right because and the reason
07:18 - why is this is it's real simple it's
07:20 - like in fact I got you know an another
07:22 - version of this question someone said
07:23 - well how would you invest $1,000 was the
07:26 - best way and I was like not no like it's
07:29 - not worth the overhead now right because
07:30 - if you invest $1,000 into something I
07:33 - don't care what kind of interest rate
07:34 - you get you could get a 30% return it's
07:37 - not gonna it's gonna take you forever to
07:38 - actually amount to anything right so but
07:41 - what you can do with that thousand
07:42 - dollars is you can invest it in yourself
07:44 - to increase your earning potential where
07:48 - $1,000 isn't a lot of money where
07:50 - $20,000 isn't a lot of money right and
07:52 - that's why I said when you said you know
07:53 - do how much money should you invest and
07:56 - I said at least 20 because if you're
07:58 - looking at $20,000 and you're like oh
07:59 -  this is a ton of money then the
08:02 - problem is that you're not earning money
08:04 - fast enough so you're not gonna be able
08:05 - investment if and so so the best and
08:07 - highest form of investment that you can
08:08 - do is to invest in yourself to increase
08:10 - your earning potential so you can get to
08:12 - the point where you're making we're not
08:14 - broke right we're not making we're
08:16 - making more than a hundred thousand
08:17 - dollars a year so you can save fifty
08:19 - thousand last year $80,000 $100,000 a
08:22 - year and now you've got now you can
08:24 - invest that money you can actually make
08:26 - some real money
08:27 - with that right because the thing about
08:28 - it I think a lot of people understand
08:29 - about finances and especially you know
08:32 - our situation is that you know the
08:34 - relative costs right or the costs for us
08:37 - to live like what it costs for us to you
08:39 - know have food have shelter have a nice
08:41 - car right even even living comfortably
08:43 - that doesn't change over time right
08:47 - that's there's pretty much
08:48 - okay so when you make more money right
08:51 - when let's say that let's say it cost
08:53 - you $80,000 to live a comfortable
08:54 - lifestyle yep okay if you're making
08:56 - $100,000 a year you're getting by like
09:00 - you're fine you're able to live the
09:01 - comfort but you're not able to save
09:02 - anything okay
09:03 - but now if you can make $200,000 a year
09:06 - right you're when you reach that point
09:09 - your cost is still 80,000 it doesn't so
09:11 - now you have all this leftover money and
09:13 - if you make 300 like it just keeps on
09:15 - scaling up and so but the beauty of that
09:17 - is that the money that you're saving
09:19 - that you're making more than you need to
09:20 - live off of you can take that money and
09:23 - you can invest that money and the bigger
09:25 - that gap is the more that you can invest
09:28 - and the more that you can create passive
09:29 - income so you can get to the point where
09:31 - that 80 thousand dollars you need to
09:32 - live off of comfortably it's coming
09:35 - automatic where you're not having to
09:36 - work for it and that's the key that's
09:38 - the key that's when you're not broke
09:39 - right because I would even say like that
09:42 - it doesn't matter how much money you're
09:43 - making right because we said a hundred
09:45 - thousand dollars you're you're broke I
09:46 - would say you're broke unless you're
09:48 - living off of money you didn't have to
09:49 - work for if you have to go and do
09:52 - something to make that money if that
09:53 - money isn't automatically coming to you
09:55 - you're broke because why because as soon
09:57 - as you stop working you're poor yeah so
10:00 - you're just one step away from poor
10:01 - right or however much money you have in
10:03 - your bank account until it runs out but
10:05 - if you have money that's coming in that
10:07 - you don't have to work for yeah then
10:09 - that's the only time you're wealthy huh
10:11 - right and you doesn't even have to be a
10:12 - lot of money if you can live up in 20
10:14 - thousand dollars a year and you got
10:15 - twenty five thousand dollars with the
10:17 - passive income you're wealthy you're
10:19 - more wealthy than the lawyer making
10:20 - three hundred thousand dollars a year
10:21 - because you don't have to work you can
10:24 - sit on your butt all day and do nothing
10:25 - whereas he has to work to maintain his
10:28 - lifestyle they exactly go to other
10:29 - countries yeah
10:31 - like they'll so like what a lot of
10:33 - people will do is the Lord there costs a
10:36 - lot which is pretty beneficial and
10:38 - especially if you're getting passive
10:40 - income I mean even if you're getting
10:41 - let's say somehow you figure out a way
10:43 - to get passive income from real estate
10:45 - or whatever the case may be and you're
10:47 - getting 20 30 40 50 thousand dollars a
10:50 - year it's possible you could just pick
10:53 - up your bags and start traveling to
10:54 - different places and live pretty frugal
10:57 - leave because in other countries it's a
10:58 - lot less expensive than let's say United
11:00 - States living in San Francisco oh yeah
11:02 - alright so you could be in Bali
11:04 - Indonesia having the time of your life
11:06 - for twenty thousand dollars a year or
11:08 - thirty thousand dollars a year and in
11:11 - that case you're pretty rich exactly
11:13 - yeah it doesn't have to be a lot of
11:14 - money right it's like it's again like we
11:15 - could talk about like you can make a lot
11:17 - of money at a job but it's very similar
11:19 - to you know like you know being in a
11:21 - prison like you're not gonna call home
11:24 - and be like yeah yeah it's okay mom
11:25 - you know this prison is awesome we have
11:28 - like these awesome couches and we've got
11:30 - you know these great TVs and the bars
11:33 - they're made of gold the bars are made
11:35 - of gold in this prison you got check the
11:37 -  out right yeah you still be in
11:38 - prison yeah it doesn't matter like it
11:41 - could be beautiful and it could be the
11:42 - most expensive extravagant prison in the
11:45 - world but it's still prison you still
11:46 - don't have a choice you have to be there
11:48 - and it's the same thing with a high
11:49 - income job right well you don't have an
11:51 - investor yep and create passive income
11:53 - you could be making a ton of money
11:54 - you can have a nice car
11:55 - you can have a nice house but guess what
11:57 - you don't get to enjoy it because you
11:58 - don't have time and that's
11:59 - that's the difference that's why it
12:01 - makes such a difference while you're
12:02 - still broke when when you're making a
12:04 - lot of money is because you have to work
12:06 - for that money I hundred percent agree
12:08 - like that is a very important thing so
12:10 - now somebody wants to get to the people
12:13 - have to figure out how to get to that
12:14 - and I think yesterday's called that was
12:16 - really important for people and people
12:17 - watching this right now your first step
12:20 - is to figure out how you're gonna get a
12:22 - high income skill and you need to stop
12:25 - thinking that seventy eighty ninety
12:27 - thousand dollars is a lot of money right
12:30 - the only way to get to the point or you
12:32 - can get passive income isn't
12:34 - happening anytime soon right right I
12:36 - really think if people can wrap their
12:38 - mind around that it will really help
12:39 - them because people are looking in like
12:41 - terms of one year to year windows but
12:43 - what they feel I
12:44 - Tony Robbins says he'll he says he'll
12:47 - overestimate what you can do in a year
12:49 - but he goes you'll underestimate what
12:50 - you can do in ten years in a decade 100%
12:52 - yeah so if you think in terms of five
12:56 - years which you talk about a lot or you
12:58 - think in terms of ten years like Tony
13:00 - Robbins that's a you have a lot of time
13:02 - that's the long term play should be
13:04 - thinking of I'm thinking of it for
13:07 - myself in terms of a long term play like
13:08 - I'm not thinking of stopping anytime
13:11 - soon I'm thinking in 10 years if I have
13:14 - passive income great even if I don't I'm
13:17 - still young as and I can keep going
13:18 - but that allows me to play the long game
13:20 - and hustle and keep at it at the process
13:23 - if I'm thinking man
13:24 - by the time I'm 24 right now so if I'm
13:26 - like but it's how I'm 26
13:28 - I'll just have passive income and that
13:30 - should be perfect if I'm 26 and I'm not
13:32 - there I'm just gonna be like whining and
13:34 - crying like a little like I don't
13:36 - have the money you know and I'm gonna
13:37 - quit so I think that having that mindset
13:40 - of really playing the long-term game
13:42 - there is a lot of benefit to it so talk
13:44 - to me about a little bit about like that
13:46 - you talk a lot about the
13:47 - process-oriented mindset so somebody
13:50 - wants to be able to make that income how
13:51 - would that help them I mean the big
13:54 - thing is is that the thing that we
13:56 - always talk about which is leverage
13:57 - right that that's the key there because
13:59 - the thing is like you can only do so
14:01 - much on your own right so let's say that
14:03 - you aren't you know you're really
14:05 - telling to developer you make a lot of
14:06 - money as a regular job what are you
14:09 - gonna make like I mean some of my
14:11 - coaching clients that are living in New
14:12 - York or San Francisco the top I've ever
14:15 - seen one of them make is like a total of
14:17 - like $250,000 total comp which is a lot
14:19 - of money I mean it's it's not you know
14:22 - but but it's it's not you know it's so
14:24 - in in in big terms it's not a lot right
14:27 - so you know that's all you can do by
14:29 - yourself right and maybe if you're a
14:31 - freelancer and maybe you can build like
14:33 - two three hundred bucks an hour maybe
14:34 - you can do a little better than that
14:35 - make you do like three four hundred
14:36 - thousand dollars a year I could say but
14:38 - you're capped out at what one person can
14:41 - do when you're doing that kind of stuff
14:43 - what you need is leverage leverage is
14:45 - utilizing something else like a fulcrum
14:48 - right to be able to to get more than
14:50 - what one person can do right and so that
14:53 - leverage can you can exist you can have
14:55 - it in multiple ways right like even when
14:57 - you're
14:57 - doing freelancing we were talking about
14:58 - like you actually hired other people to
15:01 - work for you so you almost have like an
15:02 - agency you're building a business around
15:03 - that so that's leverage okay you know in
15:06 - the business leverages other people it's
15:08 - other people but it's also it could be a
15:10 - platform right it could be things that
15:11 - sell right if I go and I have to walk to
15:14 - people I'm like hey do you want to buy
15:15 - this thing
15:16 - I can only sell as much as I can talk to
15:18 - people but if I have a website and I
15:20 - have people visiting my youtube channel
15:22 - and be visiting my blog and then I have
15:24 - emails that are automatically going out
15:25 - to them and selling them I can I'm
15:28 - leveraging that I'm leveraging that so
15:29 - that I have more on my time right and I
15:32 - think you know the big powerful concept
15:34 - here is to understand that like the you
15:36 - know you in order to make more money by
15:38 - yourself without leverage you just have
15:39 - to work harder Yeah right you got to get
15:41 - smarter you got to work harder but
15:43 - there's a limit to that but you know
15:44 - let's say you have a website and let's
15:46 - say that that website is getting like I
15:48 - don't know like a thousand visitors a
15:50 - day and let's say from that thousand
15:52 - videos visitors a day you can make let's
15:55 - let's let's be generous and say a
15:57 - hundred bucks a day okay well in order
15:59 - for you to make a thousand bucks a day
16:02 - from the hundred all you need to do is
16:03 - have instead of a thousand people
16:05 - visiting your website ten thousand yes
16:07 - and it doesn't require any more work
16:09 - right I mean there's really not much of
16:11 - a difference between that that's the
16:13 - power of leverage and if you end up
16:15 - making it so that you can get ten
16:17 - thousand people to visit your website
16:18 - per day now you're making or what do we
16:20 - say a thousand ten thousand a hundred
16:22 - thousand now you're making $10,000 or a
16:24 - thousand dollars a day to ten thousand
16:26 - dollars a day right and it just scales
16:28 - you know to do but the the beauty of it
16:30 - is using leverage like that is that it
16:32 - doesn't require any more work for me
16:34 - right you know like we've got YouTube
16:36 - channels we've got blogs right
16:37 - we have people visiting our pages and
16:40 - although we're making content right
16:43 - we're getting more and more people Yeah
16:45 - right on a daily basis and as that grows
16:47 - everything we do gets multiplied right
16:50 - we're doing the same amount of work I'm
16:51 - not doing any more work when I had 2,000
16:54 - subscribers on my channel I'm not doing
16:55 - any more work now than having you know
16:58 - almost 200,000 subscribers right we're
17:00 - doing the same amount of work but we're
17:01 - getting paid more because of leverage
17:03 - whereas when you work your regular job
17:04 - and you don't have leverage you don't
17:06 - get paid more just because you've been
17:07 - there
17:08 - well maybe you make a make get a little
17:10 - bit of rain
17:10 - but yeah you want to make more money you
17:12 - gotta work harder yep there's so much
17:14 - leverage once you have something that
17:16 - allows you to multiply outside of you
17:18 - doing something so for example when
17:20 - you're sleeping your YouTube channel is
17:22 - still showing videos right and people
17:24 - can find value in everything so for
17:26 - example we have so even right now in my
17:29 - life I'm like okay we can either sell
17:31 - more products or we have enough leverage
17:34 - based on the channel to go out to other
17:36 - people to sell them on and we can help
17:39 - them with their social media agency and
17:41 - launches and charge $20,000 for three
17:43 - days in person or we could actually have
17:46 - developers who are under clever
17:48 - programmer agency and then like put them
17:50 - on up work by the way if you guys think
17:52 - that's a good idea you should comment
17:53 - that below because I was talking to Erin
17:54 - about then I was considering it actually
17:56 - I was actually considering it make an
17:58 - agency in a clever programmer we have
18:00 - lots of developers simple programmer has
18:02 - lots of developers yeah I'm actually
18:03 - curious about that too like how that
18:06 - would work and I feel like that could be
18:08 - really beneficial for the developers
18:09 - because they could have like you could
18:11 - vet them for example or I could vet them
18:13 - and see the quality of them and then
18:16 - like help them land or negotiate then
18:19 - they'd perform the work like how what do
18:21 - you actually think about that idea no I
18:22 - mean it's agency model it makes sense
18:24 - because they get to benefit from the
18:25 - branding and the reputation that we've
18:27 - built so they'll be more likely to get
18:29 - the jobs they'll get the experience and
18:30 - they'll also have some people to turn to
18:32 - because if you're just a freelancer by
18:34 - yourself on up work and you're bidding
18:35 - on jobs you know you don't have the
18:37 - branding you don't have the the name
18:38 - behind it and also when you're doing the
18:41 - work if you have a question you don't
18:42 - know what to do it's just you you it's
18:45 - not really many people you can ask but
18:46 - if you belong to you know our brand
18:49 - under our umbrella we've got you know a
18:51 - hundred different developers or you know
18:53 - experts that you can ask they can help
18:55 - you you know when you're stuck on a
18:56 - project so I think there's definitely
18:57 - some value and on both sides there so
19:00 -  this idea is really coming along
19:03 - Erin's
19:04 - get ready to get overwhelmed there's a
19:07 - lot of more work so let us know
19:09 - what you think about this but this is
19:11 - just an example of great leverage you
19:13 - know so it's like there are multiple
19:15 - ways you can go about it and those are
19:18 - things that you don't need to manually
19:20 - put in so much work to kind of work for
19:22 - you right so I feel like building a high
19:25 - income skill is very important but then
19:27 - figuring out quickly the way to leverage
19:30 - it so like the best advice I could give
19:32 - to somebody you know with my naive brain
19:34 - and you could add on to it more and give
19:36 - us something more intelligent but the
19:37 - one thing I say to everyone who's doing
19:39 - coding is the simplest way the most
19:41 - brain-dead way to get leverage right is
19:44 - the same notes that you take for
19:46 - yourself the same things that you
19:48 - learned for yourself just put them on
19:50 - medium calm right right which is a blog
19:53 - posting website or put it on YouTube
19:57 - like the same thing you're learning put
19:58 - it for yourself and just start teaching
20:00 - whatever you're learning just start
20:01 - putting it on YouTube without even
20:03 - thinking like you're teaching it like
20:04 - almost document it for yourself and
20:06 - you'll have an audience that you can
20:08 - leverage so yeah you know that's what I
20:10 - kind of think yeah no I agree I mean
20:12 - that's the the whole idea is that you
20:15 - should make whatever work that you do
20:17 - work more than once and that's you know
20:19 - that's the key whatever you're doing you
20:21 - want to take whatever you're doing and
20:23 - have it be a way to multiply that right
20:25 - and so you know if you're gonna learn
20:27 - you're gonna spend the time learning
20:28 - something you might as well teach it as
20:29 - well because it doesn't take you much
20:31 - more effort to do that and it's a
20:32 - multiplier right it's like you know yeah
20:35 - I guess we could look at the you know
20:36 - kind of the levels right if you do
20:38 - something right like listen you become a
20:40 - programmer and you're doing code like I
20:42 - said you can only do that yourself you
20:44 - can only make so much money you're kind
20:45 - of capped there that's kind of the first
20:46 - level but then above that is teaching
20:49 - people to do something you can't paid a
20:51 - lot more money to do that why it's
20:53 - because it's leverage it's because when
20:55 - you're coding on a project you can only
20:56 - do that project but if you teach a
20:58 - thousand developers how to code and they
21:01 - start coding on projects now you're
21:02 - creating a ha a huge more a huge amount
21:05 - more value in the world and you always
21:07 - get paid based on the value that you
21:08 - produce and so then the third level is a
21:10 - platform I'm writing this down
21:12 - you know you've got like platforms like
21:15 - Facebook or Amazon or Instagram or
21:17 - YouTube these are all platforms and what
21:19 - they allow people to do is to sell a
21:21 - product a service or to teach you know
21:24 - on that platform so there's multiple
21:26 - teachers there and so there by having
21:28 - that platform like thing about the
21:29 - YouTube platform they're getting massive
21:31 - amounts of value because they're
21:33 - enabling people to have a place to teach
21:35 - to teach other people how to do to
21:37 - create all that value and that's why
21:39 - they make the most money and so you
21:41 - start off learning something having a
21:42 - high income skill but then you graduate
21:44 - to the second level where you teach
21:45 - other people how to do it and then if
21:47 - you get to that third level you can
21:48 - build a platform that's where you really
21:50 - make the money because you have them why
21:52 - do you make the most money because you
21:53 - have the most amount of leverage
21:54 - wherever you have the most leverage
21:55 - that's where you're gonna make the most
21:56 - amount of money agree and again this is
21:59 - something you guys can get started with
22:00 - today like literally if you're watching
22:02 - this it's great that you're consuming
22:05 - this content it's awesome but we don't
22:07 - give a unless unless you take
22:10 - action like that's what we really care
22:12 - about that's what I really care about
22:13 - like please if you're watching this
22:15 - content take some action so for example
22:17 - for you it might look like like taking
22:20 - the five word script you wrote today the
22:24 - day before or last week just literally
22:27 - make it public on medium you know yeah
22:29 - or make a little two-minute video and
22:32 - put it on your YouTube and if you do
22:34 - that and you put in a comments below
22:36 - I'll jump there and I'll comment back
22:38 - because I think that would be really
22:39 - awesome but please like start taking
22:42 - some kind of action and the great thing
22:44 - is that you're not even going out of
22:45 - your way if you're documenting it so
22:47 - like for example you can think of it as
22:49 - like level one you learning a skill
22:51 - level two you're teaching a skill level
22:52 - three building a platform but I think
22:55 - you can just start doing the learning
22:58 - and the documenting at the same time
22:59 - which will build up which will give you
23:01 - an audience and people that you're
23:03 - providing value can help - all you need
23:05 - to do is just whatever you're learning
23:07 - just put it out there exactly don't even
23:10 - talk like an expert don't pretend to be
23:11 - an expert just put it out there hundred
23:13 - percent
23:13 - yep that's how I got started right I
23:15 - didn't know no one gave me no one gave
23:17 - me a little scepter and today you're an
23:19 - authority now yeah I just I just started
23:21 - doing it I just started talking about it
23:23 - I just started creating blog posts I
23:24 - just started writing about it and then
23:26 - when you do it long enough and you
23:28 - influence enough people and enough
23:30 - people start talking about you pretty
23:31 - soon you're the guy you're the authority
23:33 - you don't you don't have to be anointed
23:34 - I guess that's that's the thing is like
23:35 - people are waiting to be anointed
23:37 - instead of just taking action right just
23:39 - just assume they're waiting for a
23:40 - gatekeeper someone to say you're good
23:42 - enough you have permission and you know
23:44 - what you're what you're gonna have is
23:46 - you know you're gonna have haters and
23:48 - that's that's what you're gonna have to
23:49 - deal with but you got to get out there
23:51 - and you got to do it because no one else
23:53 - is gonna say okay now you're ready right
23:55 - it's like it's like you know people that
23:57 - are at a job and they're waiting to get
23:59 - that promotion but I never asked the
24:01 - boss for the promotion and they're just
24:02 - waiting until someone recognized never
24:04 - happens yesterday we were on a call yeah
24:06 - you know and Brett was talking about it
24:09 - and he's like he got 1% or something
24:11 - yeah and I immediately called it out and
24:13 - I was like did you like I feel like you
24:15 - probably didn't ask for more right
24:17 - exactly right so I feel for him but then
24:19 - at the end of the call he actually left
24:21 - it as a message in the chat where he was
24:23 - like I was afraid to like actually ask
24:25 - for more right right so if you don't ask
24:28 - you don't get I told that lesson to
24:31 - Aaron who's walking can you can you zoom
24:32 - in on him right there if you don't ask
24:35 - you don't get Aaron remember if you
24:39 - don't ask you don't get
24:42 - yeah there you go so remember like you
24:46 - have to be able to ask for those things
24:48 - and be able to demand those things you
24:51 - know like so when it comes to
24:52 - negotiations it can be literally as
24:53 - simple as most people are performing
24:55 - really well most bosses would be more
24:57 - than happy to pay them more like would
24:59 - not have a problem but just sometimes
25:01 - those conversations don't start oh yeah
25:03 - yeah no it's big sometimes you ask for
25:05 - the moon sometimes you get the moon or
25:07 - sometimes you don't earn alright guys so
25:12 - this was the video if you're gonna make
25:14 - $100,000 you're gonna be broke which is
25:17 - a really sad part but the really great
25:20 - part is that if you actually internalize
25:23 - that and you make it your belief instead
25:25 - of being depressed you can do something
25:27 - about it yeah aim to make a million
25:30 - dollars or five million dollars or ten
25:32 - million dollars aim to make it passive
25:34 - aim to make it where you don't have to
25:36 - work for it then you're not broke that's
25:38 - what I would say right so aim to make it
25:41 - passive eventually where you don't have
25:42 - to work and you are not gonna be broke
25:45 - because your passive income is gonna be
25:48 - working on your behalf
25:49 - alright so that is the ultimate goal
25:52 - where you're gonna stop being broke it
25:54 - takes a lot of time it takes a lot of
25:55 - effort it takes a lot of hard hard work
25:58 - it's really hard but I believe that it
26:01 - is worth it definitely right I believe
26:03 - that this is a cause worth fighting for
26:05 - for yourself for your family for for the
26:10 - freedom that you would want to have in
26:11 - your life because I value a lot of
26:13 - freedom a lot I know John values freedom
26:15 - like crazy so that's what it is I think
26:18 - I hope that this video about providing
26:20 - with some value please comment below
26:22 - what was your biggest takeaway from this
26:24 - video this helps us me and John going to
26:29 - the questions and get deeper with you
