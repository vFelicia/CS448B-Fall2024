02:15 - i think for a conference or whatever it
02:16 - might be and i'm here blake let's get
02:18 - together
02:18 - i remember at that point you were
02:20 - working on a project or something
02:22 - and then you will you were working the
02:23 - project and you were literally doing an
02:26 - all-nighter because you had to finish i
02:27 - don't think we had slept because
02:29 - it was uh hamilton and i don't think we
02:31 - had slept in probably
02:32 - three or four days so holy [ __ ] that's
02:36 - crazy that's crazy
02:37 - so yeah uh blake i know you have
02:40 - introduced you often juice a little bit
02:41 - but tommy kind of a little bit of kind
02:42 - of like
02:43 - what do you currently do i know you
02:44 - don't you do monzi but tell me
02:46 - about what yourself you know in terms of
02:48 - like what your current situation is
02:50 - because it doesn't matter it's been a
02:51 - while since i've
02:52 - since i've talked to you so tell me kind
02:54 - of a rundown of what you're currently
02:55 - doing are doing specifically
02:57 - yeah so i've got my hands in a couple
02:59 - different things right now
03:00 - um really majority of it is still
03:02 - software related it's just different
03:04 - sectors of it so you know one is
03:06 - obviously mozzie the agency
03:09 - we've actually shifted a little bit of
03:10 - our focus from what our
03:12 - our focus was last year so for the past
03:15 - three years we've been really focused on
03:16 - automation software
03:18 - specifically in oil and gas clean energy
03:21 - wealth management automotive those
03:23 - spaces and then the past
03:25 - eight months or so we've really shifted
03:27 - um and this is something we'll get into
03:29 - we can get into a little bit later but
03:30 - we've shifted because uh
03:32 - we had a client that came to us and
03:33 - needed some telehealth related
03:35 - um application support so telehealth
03:38 - what what is
03:38 - what is still health telehealth is going
03:40 - to be things like
03:42 - um integrating video chats or things
03:44 - like zoom
03:45 - into applications voice calling a voice
03:48 - over ip
03:49 - call center technology so really the
03:52 - past
03:52 - eight months we've gotten really heavy
03:55 - on that kind of technology and a
03:56 - majority of our client base has
03:59 - shifted initially into that and then
04:00 - branching out to do automation software
04:02 - software with us after um but that's
04:05 - kind of the core focus of where mozy is
04:07 - at right now
04:08 - um some of the other things that i'm
04:09 - working on as well is uh addiction
04:11 - recovery software mm-hmm
04:14 - six or seven months ago connected with
04:16 - an organization
04:17 - that provides uh health record
04:20 - management platforms for
04:24 - addiction recovery clinics so if
04:25 - somebody comes in they may have an
04:27 - alcohol or substance abuse addiction
04:29 - they come in and they can use our
04:30 - platform to
04:31 - go from initial intake all the way to
04:32 - post recovery and connect with um
04:35 - we call them peers so people who are
04:37 - helping people go through recovery and
04:38 - so is this like
04:39 - from a client that you have or this is
04:41 - just like your own application you start
04:42 - decide to start
04:44 - yeah so this was initially a client that
04:46 - turned into a development partnership
04:48 - no way that's awesome that's amazing
04:51 - and has that become successful uh i
04:54 - would say very successful and we've
04:55 - we've served over 160 000 people last
04:58 - year
04:58 - for um going through addiction recovery
05:01 - services through our platform
05:02 - wow that's insane so what to do they
05:04 - basically they go on this platform
05:06 - they sign up for subscription and stuff
05:07 - like that and then what they get like
05:09 - coaching or
05:10 - something like that correct yeah so
05:11 - really our tool is is more focused on
05:14 - providing the clinics and organizations
05:16 - with the tools they need to service
05:18 - their
05:18 - uh participants or people going through
05:21 - recovery
05:22 - so we'll work with organizations to
05:24 - build out custom forms or data reporting
05:27 - that allows their participants to come
05:29 - in and say hey i need to
05:30 - you know basically keep track of the
05:32 - full process so keep track of documents
05:34 - status updates they can call video all
05:36 - that kind of stuff through our platform
05:38 - gotcha gosh that's amazing so you've
05:39 - been doing some great stuff man plus i
05:41 - see that you have an audi r8 which is
05:43 - just
05:43 - [ __ ] amazing i love it
05:49 - i recently bought myself a tesla model y
05:52 - that to me has probably
05:53 - been one of the funnest things i've got
05:55 - to drive so far
05:56 - it's just like like the speed on that
05:59 - thing in acceleration is just
06:01 - insane yeah yeah well i saw i think you
06:03 - i think in the story you posted today
06:05 - you may have been in that
06:06 - because i saw the glass roof and then
06:08 - the white seats yeah yeah yeah i love it
06:10 - it was so funny i had this one uh this
06:11 - one guy
06:12 - and we'll get into a story really
06:13 - quickly here but i had there was like i
06:14 - was um
06:15 - i was driving the car and it was like 11
06:17 - p.m or something
06:19 - and there was like a every time somebody
06:20 - wants to race me like they see a test
06:22 - they want to race me for some reason
06:23 - you know and it was like 11 p.m on this
06:25 - guy and he's got his his girl on the
06:26 - right-hand side you know
06:28 - he's like he's revving the engine you
06:29 - know something like that
06:32 - and he's running the engine and then i'm
06:34 - like all right sure let go i pulled i'll
06:36 - pull down my window
06:37 - and he's like three two one i go man
06:40 - i'll leave this guy in the dust
06:43 - i figured you would that's awesome
06:46 - it's so crazy we tried it three times
06:48 - every single time he just did not
06:49 - succeed
06:50 - and then he just kind of went his own
06:51 - way after that he gave up he was
06:53 - embarrassed enough in front of his girl
06:56 - oh my god it's so funny it's so funny
06:58 - but anyways yeah so so that's amazing
07:00 - that's amazing man and how like
07:02 - what how is your company so far like
07:04 - monster i know you've transitioned fully
07:05 - do you guys still do
07:06 - like you guys still do with you still
07:08 - deal with big companies as well like
07:10 - enterprise companies you have completely
07:11 - shifted into this or
07:12 - and you guys don't have those conscious
07:14 - contracts anymore yeah so we still do
07:16 - have the uh
07:17 - some of the existing contracts that
07:18 - we've had previously that have been
07:20 - going with us for several years
07:22 - the interesting thing is that the
07:25 - demographic of our
07:26 - client base has shifted a lot so
07:28 - previously it was more small to
07:29 - medium-sized
07:30 - companies now that we've started
07:33 - focusing more on the
07:35 - telehealth and tele-related
07:37 - communications over over the internet
07:40 - we've built another partnership with a
07:42 - fairly large company
07:44 - that services that provides apis and
07:46 - services for those
07:48 - that kind of technology and so they've
07:50 - been uh
07:52 - processing a lot of referrals to us and
07:53 - a lot of their referrals are a lot
07:55 - larger companies so
07:56 - more enterprise grade customers it's
07:58 - just the technology we're building has
08:01 - changed a lot from
08:02 - that more automated automation related
08:05 - work to more
08:06 - telecommunication work gotcha gotcha
08:08 - gotcha awesome
08:09 - so guys by the way guys before we fully
08:10 - get into it i just want to let you know
08:11 - guys if you have any questions for blake
08:13 - here right
08:14 - he is he's done over his years right
08:16 - you're 22 years old it's crazy he's
08:18 - built
08:19 - a this month's agency right a very
08:21 - successful
08:22 - company i don't know if you can share
08:23 - and if it's like a million dollar
08:24 - company or not i'm guessing it's a
08:26 - million dollar company
08:27 - at this point right but yeah
08:30 - so right if you have any questions for
08:32 - him please put it in the chat i will i
08:34 - will ask him
08:35 - but before that we'll just get into it
08:37 - right now so
08:38 - so blake let's go from the beginning
08:40 - kind of tell me kind of you know
08:42 - what like how you got started like i
08:44 - know in high school
08:45 - you start up let's go from the beginning
08:47 - in terms of in in high school what were
08:49 - you doing back then and what got you
08:51 - into coding yeah yeah so it's a fairly
08:53 - long story so feel free to cut me off at
08:55 - any time
08:56 - and tell me after but
08:59 - so when i was in um i think it was
09:01 - either my
09:02 - sophomore junior year in high school i
09:04 - you know i'd always been
09:05 - involved in computers i played video
09:07 - games growing up always computer games
09:10 - when i was probably 10 or 11 i figured
09:12 - out how to do port forwarding so that i
09:13 - could host my own
09:15 - game server and that taught me a little
09:17 - bit of java
09:18 - but i had no clue what i was doing but
09:20 - it kind of set the
09:23 - because years and so
09:27 - um junior sophomore year of high school
09:29 - uh i found something on a forum about
09:30 - bitcoin and this is when i first got
09:32 - into crypto
09:32 - and i found that um there was a
09:35 - potential business to be
09:36 - to be made there where people were
09:38 - wanting to transact bitcoin through
09:40 - um individuals and not go to an exchange
09:42 - and purchase it
09:43 - so i came up with an idea that was a
09:46 - website that i
09:47 - i just found a theme for and put some
09:49 - random like html code in for
09:52 - just change the text um and it allowed
09:55 - people to
09:56 - transact bitcoin with between peers so
09:59 - you and i could come up to each other
10:00 - and say hey i want to buy 50 worth of
10:01 - bitcoin from you
10:03 - i provide you 50 us dollars you provide
10:05 - me 50 bucks worth of bitcoin
10:06 - and exchange it back so now how do you
10:09 - how now
10:10 - that's awesome but how did you for
10:12 - example i'm
10:13 - microass is like how did you get it well
10:15 - known it's like did you put it like
10:17 - in the forums that hey i'm doing this
10:19 - like how did you get known
10:20 - for that so the first piece was a form
10:23 - that um that's where i got the idea
10:24 - because because i saw all these people
10:26 - that they were just
10:27 - writing form posts basically doing the
10:29 - same thing but inside of a tech form so
10:31 - like okay let's build it let's build a
10:32 - site for this the second piece was
10:34 - there was already other peer-to-peer
10:36 - exchanges like paxful and local bitcoins
10:38 - where you could go on there and do the
10:39 - same thing already
10:41 - we just wanted to make it faster so that
10:43 - you can go on there and instantly start
10:45 - working with somebody right away um so
10:47 - that's how we were able to advertise is
10:49 - by using the forum and those places to
10:51 - bring in customers um into our platform
10:54 - gotcha and was this only by yourself was
10:56 - it only by you like you did this noah
10:58 - and you use your port forwarding
10:59 - knowledge from the from your previous
11:03 - so the technical side of it was
11:05 - extremely simple it was it was literally
11:07 - like an html
11:08 - website with some php and the thing was
11:11 - this this is where the light bulb
11:12 - switched on after all of this
11:14 - you know kind of after i stopped the
11:16 - bitcoin stuff so
11:18 - we had to uh initially we were allowing
11:20 - people to
11:21 - transact with paypal and i was like okay
11:23 - how do i add paypal to a website so
11:26 - funny thing is i went on upwork and i
11:27 - found somebody who could integrate a
11:29 - paypal checkout piece to my
11:31 - website because i could do the html that
11:33 - made sense yeah it was too hard
11:35 - yeah um and so we hired this person i
11:38 - paid him 180 bucks and they threw the
11:39 - paypal thing in there and got it to work
11:41 - nice and so we were able to start
11:43 - transacting and making money
11:45 - so we run this thing and i say we
11:47 - because this is the
11:48 - this is the funny piece here so i was
11:50 - not 18 so i couldn't hold
11:53 - uh i couldn't hold any merchant accounts
11:55 - or
11:56 - like paypal accounts or anything or even
11:58 - like a legit bank account that i could
12:00 - send money through because i wasn't 18.
12:01 - because you were 16 17 years old
12:03 - probably or what yeah
12:04 - i was i was 16. i was i think when i
12:07 - started this i had just turned 17.
12:09 - um so i couldn't hold any of these
12:11 - accounts right and so i'm thinking
12:13 - i know i can make money off this how do
12:14 - i do it so i go to my mom
12:16 - and i say hey mom you know i have this
12:19 - idea i'm like 100 sure it's going to
12:21 - make money
12:22 - and this is a business lesson for
12:24 - everybody
12:25 - today this is my this is my mom so i i
12:28 - couldn't care less
12:29 - but if you're ever working with somebody
12:31 - else in business it's not like your mom
12:34 - always remember this so when i went to
12:35 - where i said i got this idea i just need
12:37 - you to
12:38 - hold an account for me like literally
12:39 - open up a bank account for me and i
12:40 - could run with it right
12:42 - and i'll make the money i told her i'll
12:43 - give you 50 of everything i make
12:45 - oh wow if you just hold the account okay
12:47 - right that's a pretty good deal
12:49 - a pretty good deal right so we started
12:52 - running through it we run for about
12:54 - probably eight to ten months um this is
12:56 - when bitcoin was fairly early on so
12:58 - prices were 200 to 300
12:59 - each fluctuating around there and
13:03 - we did really well the thing was the
13:05 - regulations as it started to pick up it
13:07 - got
13:07 - got really harsh yeah and even now you
13:09 - can go to the same sites and that is 10
13:11 - times harder
13:12 - so we stopped doing it and i went from
13:15 - making pretty good money you know
13:17 - anywhere from 1000 to 2000 a week while
13:20 - i was 16 17 years old holy [ __ ]
13:23 - yeah to making zero um because the
13:26 - regulations
13:27 - i mean i'm thinking no did you at least
13:30 - get to save some money like while you
13:32 - know while you're making 2 1 000
13:33 - 2 000 a week well being a 16 year old
13:36 - kid that has a passion in cars
13:38 - um i actually spent pretty much every
13:40 - dime of it that's the
13:42 - that's the bad thing was i was like okay
13:44 - this is funding all of my car
13:45 - projects and all of those were pieces of
13:48 - crap cars so
13:50 - um it all went to waste but so i
13:53 - definitely learned from it but this is
13:54 - the most valuable piece
13:56 - i went from that to zero within about a
13:59 - week
13:59 - i even remember when it all happened it
14:01 - was on my birthday and i was on a trip
14:04 - with my mom in florida when it all just
14:05 - kind of
14:06 - we realized hey we can't do this anymore
14:08 - because the regulations are too hard
14:10 - right so i go to making zero dollars and
14:12 - i'm
14:14 - you know 17 years old and i'm like holy
14:16 - crap i was
14:17 - able to spend spend spend and i had
14:20 - something really working for me
14:23 - what do i do why can't i just do
14:26 - exactly what that guy i hired on upwork
14:28 - does and so that's when i got into
14:30 - programming and at first
14:32 - i didn't think pro for some reason it
14:33 - didn't click with me that programming
14:34 - was an actual career that people got
14:36 - paid
14:36 - really money yeah i just thought this
14:38 - was something that like
14:40 - you know kids do that play video games
14:42 - they just hack stuff together and like
14:43 - build it randomly i can't actually
14:45 - understand that
14:46 - you could go out and get paid you know
14:48 - 100k or whatever the amount is for it so
14:51 - like like this this stuff just comes up
14:53 - magically right like using a computer
14:55 - that's like magically made right by
14:56 - something like that or something you
14:57 - don't connect the dots
14:59 - like the whole time i was never
15:00 - connecting the dots like hey all this
15:01 - stuff i'm using somebody's building
15:03 - yeah and so that's when i that's when it
15:07 - clicked with me and i actually signed up
15:08 - for a
15:09 - freelancer.com account and started doing
15:12 - some jobs and
15:13 - i i remember literally every single
15:15 - first job
15:16 - because it was like a hundred dollar job
15:19 - for a full e-commerce php website holy
15:22 - [ __ ]
15:24 - like no wordpress or anything custom
15:25 - coded 100 wow
15:27 - how long did it take you to build that
15:28 - site like two months and the guy was
15:31 - pissed off because it took so long
15:32 - right i'm like you paid 100
15:36 - but at the end of it i was like holy
15:39 - crap i made 100 bucks
15:40 - like i may if you equate it out it's
15:42 - probably like five cents an hour for all
15:44 - the time i put into it but i was like
15:45 - hey i made it i made 100 bucks
15:47 - yeah and it just slowly started growing
15:50 - and i saw that
15:51 - by december of my senior year i had a
15:54 - job for 800 bucks and i remember coming
15:56 - downstairs my mom was sitting on the
15:57 - couch and i was telling her like hey
15:59 - i got this job for eight hundred dollars
16:01 - for programming
16:02 - i just made eight hundred dollars for
16:03 - program for something i thought just
16:05 - magically appears you know
16:07 - yeah like somebody literally paid me 800
16:09 - bucks to do this
16:10 - yeah so that's when when it started
16:13 - i started realizing because that was i i
16:16 - always knew i didn't want to go to
16:17 - college
16:18 - but i had to uh why tell me why tell me
16:21 - why you wasn't doing the
16:22 - clutch i'm curious um so i've never
16:25 - really been
16:26 - somebody to um like socialize
16:30 - a whole lot outside of like my business
16:32 - and close friends group
16:34 - and this is this also ties in a little
16:36 - bit um
16:37 - to why like how i found one of my new
16:40 - passions which is
16:41 - helping people with addiction um so i
16:45 - you know family line has addiction
16:48 - related problems
16:49 - on on my dad's side i know a lot of
16:51 - people who've gone through
16:53 - alcohol drugs substance abuse problems
16:56 - and so
16:57 - college the life is is very focused on
17:01 - alcohol substances are used quite often
17:04 - there
17:05 - and it just didn't seem like something
17:07 - that i was really comfortable with and
17:09 - that
17:09 - that was the personal thing that really
17:11 - kind of dug at me was
17:12 - was i knew the partying side of it i
17:14 - know there's a large majority of people
17:16 - who don't do that and are very focused
17:17 - but for some reason that just
17:19 - um that's kind of me a little bit too
17:21 - much and
17:23 - so in my head that's when i started
17:24 - thinking okay i have to figure something
17:27 - out here
17:27 - because in my head college just wasn't
17:29 - an option um
17:31 - even though it was like financial and
17:33 - everything it was so like financially
17:34 - you can afford it but like
17:36 - because of the partying because the
17:37 - alcohol it just did not work out
17:39 - like it's just like it's like your mind
17:40 - was just blocking you like you know what
17:42 - because was it because like you were
17:44 - scared but if you got into it then you
17:46 - will go back
17:46 - like an addiction potential or something
17:48 - like that is that why yeah yeah
17:50 - i think i think that's a big part of it
17:52 - um is when i see
17:54 - like i know if i surround myself around
17:57 - something long enough
17:59 - most likely i will become a part of that
18:01 - and
18:02 - from all my previous experiences i've
18:04 - i've talked i i've
18:06 - felt enough to know i don't want to be a
18:08 - part of that and i've
18:09 - especially now like working with 160 000
18:11 - people on a platform and having
18:13 - like a complete power bi reporting
18:16 - system on it
18:17 - yeah you see you see how big of an issue
18:19 - this is and so
18:21 - and and some people i know plenty people
18:24 - think i'm an extremist
18:25 - on on the whole alcohol and drug thing
18:28 - but
18:29 - yeah it's just because i've had to deal
18:30 - with it and felt it so much that
18:32 - it's it's such a um kind of soft spot
18:35 - that i've got
18:35 - so honestly i still understand it
18:38 - because it partially i'm like that too
18:39 - actually
18:40 - um partially like i'm very much scared
18:42 - of that of that portion as well and i
18:43 - know this deviates a little bit from
18:44 - what we're talking but we'll get to this
18:45 - in
18:46 - a little bit back back to our story but
18:49 - right
18:49 - i'm like that too like i've had some
18:51 - family past family as well who've always
18:53 - struggled with addiction you know in
18:55 - ukraine right may that be with alcohol
18:57 - or anything else and to me that's always
18:58 - been scary it's always been scary to try
19:00 - for me for example
19:01 - alcohol that's why even when i went to
19:02 - college like i was very
19:04 - i was like i couldn't go to parties like
19:06 - i was not much of a party guy
19:07 - right to just i want i drove to the
19:10 - class
19:10 - i learned how to draw back to home you
19:12 - know it's like class home class hope you
19:14 - know what i mean
19:15 - so it's kind of like i i totally get it
19:18 - like it's
19:19 - it's it's definitely it is a worry to
19:21 - think about because
19:23 - that can lead to not such a good path
19:26 - you see what i mean but but you realize
19:29 - that and you figured it out
19:30 - right you're like you know what i
19:31 - realized that that's not main option i
19:32 - want to go to you're like
19:34 - i want to try something else but my
19:36 - question to you now is before we go
19:38 - forward is like right
19:39 - you said that hey you know what you
19:41 - started getting jobs you started doing
19:43 - jobs in freelance you signed up for
19:44 - freelancer
19:45 - here's the thing blake most people
19:49 - are afraid to even sign up for a job or
19:52 - sign up for
19:52 - a freelancer to come on up pri up work
19:55 - you know
19:56 - when they don't have that experience or
19:58 - don't have the knowledge just yet
20:00 - yeah what was different in your mind
20:03 - that was like you know what
20:04 - doesn't matter if i don't have the
20:05 - experience doesn't matter if i you know
20:07 - don't know it
20:09 - what what different your mind said that
20:10 - you still went for it
20:12 - it it so in my head i never looked at it
20:14 - as like
20:16 - oh i need to have all this knowledge
20:18 - first like the first 30 days i started
20:20 - programming i was like okay i have a lot
20:21 - to pick up on here
20:22 - but and i have kept this whole mindset
20:26 - even up until today you see some of the
20:28 - deals we close and i do it the same way
20:30 - i did it even when i when i first
20:31 - started
20:32 - in terms of the mindset i have because
20:33 - it's always worked and
20:35 - it's every when i started i would look
20:38 - at a deal and be like
20:39 - okay i have no clue how to do this but i
20:41 - know for a fact if i give it a week or
20:43 - two
20:44 - i can get it done and so i'd figure out
20:46 - how to close the deal
20:48 - put that into the timeline so if i knew
20:50 - i needed two weeks to learn in two weeks
20:52 - to implement it or i guess that's what
20:53 - it was
20:54 - i'd throw that in part of the timeline
20:55 - i'd keep the cost the same as just two
20:56 - weeks
20:57 - but i'd factor in the learning time and
20:59 - so even today
21:00 - we get deals that you know we'll
21:02 - straight up tell a client we have no
21:03 - idea how to do this but we've done
21:05 - similar stuff and we can figure it out
21:06 - wow and they still buy into it because
21:08 - they know
21:09 - they have confident confidence in us
21:10 - that will actually deliver on it
21:12 - so the biggest thing in my opinion is
21:15 - yes
21:16 - actually figuring out the problem and
21:18 - figuring out a solution for it
21:20 - but don't be afraid to jump in because
21:22 - as soon as i saw
21:24 - i can make 80 bucks on a site i knew i
21:26 - could make 160 bucks on something else
21:29 - and then eight hundred and two thousand
21:31 - five thousand ten thousand and on from
21:32 - there and a hundred thousand
21:34 - four getting it yeah yeah exactly that's
21:36 - insane i mean
21:37 - that i think that's a that's a really
21:38 - good mindset that you know not a lot of
21:40 - people unfortunately have it's really
21:41 - hard to get that
21:42 - you know for one right to have that kind
21:44 - of monster like you know what i'll throw
21:45 - myself in
21:46 - and then because the heart is the first
21:47 - thing that's stopping us is what
21:50 - it's us the fear like we're scared
21:54 - and and think about this though this so
21:56 - this is one piece that adds to my my
21:58 - pieces
21:59 - i knew in my head i had no other options
22:02 - right
22:02 - it was literally either succeed or
22:05 - succeed like there's no failure because
22:07 - i'm not going to college right like
22:09 - that's just not something i'm going to
22:10 - do so
22:11 - either i succeed or i succeed like
22:13 - there's no i can't
22:14 - can't fail at this so in my head i'm
22:16 - thinking i'm going to
22:17 - just go all in and get at it right i
22:19 - think that's a big thing for a lot of
22:21 - people that don't
22:22 - that have a hard time getting a hold of
22:23 - that mentality is figure out
22:26 - something find a purpose that makes you
22:29 - forced to succeed
22:30 - right that's the stuff we do with
22:32 - addiction recovery like
22:33 - it's we have such a big problem that we
22:36 - have to succeed with it because we have
22:38 - to provide this service to the people
22:40 - when we do deployments it's not just a
22:44 - oh somebody's not going to make money
22:45 - it's oh we're not going to be able to
22:47 - help potentially thousands of people
22:48 - recover from this so find a purpose with
22:50 - what you're doing and you will always
22:52 - succeed with it that is true it's a
22:53 - it's a that is that is so that is so
22:55 - very much true it's like
22:57 - whenever when i remember like but any
22:59 - start when i with any startup that i
23:01 - started or with anything any project i
23:03 - started there was always a purpose right
23:04 - for example
23:05 - for me personally one of my first
23:07 - products that i was started was like
23:09 - i did this thing called techhelp.org
23:11 - back then it was like it was one of my
23:12 - first websites and i built it using
23:14 - dreamweaver
23:14 - [Music]
23:16 - i don't know if you know what it was oh
23:18 - my god
23:19 - man i was copying the header and every
23:21 - single page i didn't know what database
23:23 - was back then so i was just like
23:24 - building something more stuff
23:26 - yeah it was pretty bad it was pretty bad
23:27 - but but like my purpose for that was
23:30 - like for example you know what i wanted
23:31 - to like
23:32 - teach technology to people right i want
23:34 - to teach i want to inspire and so forth
23:36 - then then for me for example when i
23:38 - started doing another star that was like
23:40 - my first okay well i want to
23:42 - you know one of the things that we did
23:43 - was like a trend application which is
23:45 - like an app for clothing like well
23:46 - i'm like i suck at clothing so i'm like
23:48 - i want to build an app that will help
23:50 - people clothe themselves right like
23:51 - style stuff stuff like that so you're
23:54 - right i think when you have a purpose
23:56 - it makes things so much easier versus
23:58 - just like oh you know i'll just i'll
23:59 - just give it a try
24:00 - yeah you know and i think that it's
24:04 - very easy to associate especially in the
24:05 - tech world to
24:07 - um you know associate success with money
24:09 - in the tech world because
24:11 - everybody in tech is for the most part
24:13 - making pretty good money
24:14 - um but at the end of the day if you're
24:16 - you know i caught myself last year
24:17 - thinking i'm building all these tools
24:19 - and they're making people a lot of money
24:21 - and it's making me a lot of money
24:24 - but i have absolutely no purpose other
24:26 - than to generate other people money
24:28 - and so that's as soon as when as soon as
24:31 - the addiction stuff came up that was
24:32 - like
24:32 - here we go this attaches everything that
24:34 - i've been working for to a purpose now
24:37 - really and like that did everything
24:38 - change for you like i said i remember
24:40 - you told me this i remember like
24:41 - you were speaking about this on your
24:42 - instagram where you felt like you had no
24:44 - purpose and stuff like that like
24:45 - did that one project really make such a
24:47 - big difference in your life or like holy
24:48 - [ __ ] it's just a big differentiator
24:51 - and like you feel like you're alive now
24:52 - like you feel like you're just like you
24:54 - know
24:54 - you're working towards something yeah no
24:57 - no 100
24:58 - literally so october of last year um
25:02 - my recent post kind of described this a
25:03 - little bit about how i was going through
25:05 - like one of
25:05 - the hardest times mentally for myself
25:07 - and that's when i was really struggling
25:08 - to find
25:09 - what that purpose was and so that's when
25:11 - this addiction stuff came up
25:13 - um and in october so i have a business
25:16 - coach that i meet with every two weeks
25:17 - and we talk about
25:18 - um you know what are some of the
25:19 - problems in my business what are some of
25:20 - my goals
25:21 - and so i kept telling him for for months
25:24 - hey i
25:25 - for some reason i have this really weird
25:27 - feeling that
25:28 - my car is holding me back the gtr that i
25:32 - had was holding me back
25:33 - like i just had this weird thing i'd
25:35 - wake up every morning and i'd look at it
25:36 - and be like i love this car but for some
25:37 - reason it's holding me back from
25:38 - something that's much bigger
25:40 - and told like everybody i knew this and
25:42 - i don't think really anybody understood
25:43 - why
25:44 - and so literally i sell it a week later
25:47 - addiction recovery project
25:48 - comes up and it's like focused like
25:51 - fully on focus like the car took so much
25:53 - of my attention away as soon as i let it
25:55 - go and this came
25:56 - up it was perfect timing because it
25:58 - allowed me to completely
25:59 - focus on something that was going to
26:02 - become something much bigger in the next
26:03 - coming months
26:04 - wow talk about talk about timing man
26:08 - yeah that is interesting how sometimes i
26:11 - mean honestly i mean a lot of sometimes
26:12 - that works out in
26:13 - weird ways right life can be like that
26:15 - sometimes like like
26:16 - i mean similar thing for me it was like
26:20 - like i came here the way i started
26:21 - working with clever programmer in kazi
26:22 - was like the weirdest ways you know
26:24 - you know even how i met you was the
26:26 - weirdest way right which like which
26:28 - inspired me to do other things right
26:30 - yeah it's like i don't know sometimes
26:32 - you just like you you get this gut
26:33 - feeling to do something you do it it's
26:35 - just like you know
26:36 - it's like almost like the universe is
26:37 - telling you something yeah
26:39 - you're just gonna have to listen to it
26:41 - and then when you do it just
26:42 - poof yeah like like like what the [ __ ]
26:46 - so yeah guys for those who are listening
26:48 - like it's like guys
26:49 - if you really feel like there's
26:50 - something that is in your gut that you
26:52 - want that you feel like you need to do
26:55 - you know sometimes it's it's okay to
26:57 - take a stab at it it's okay to
26:59 - to you know to listen to yourselves
27:01 - because i think the most important thing
27:02 - that we don't do
27:03 - i mean i sometimes don't do it as well
27:05 - is i'm not self-aware of myself as much
27:07 - as i
27:08 - should be you know and i listen to
27:10 - myself as much as i should be
27:11 - sometimes like holy [ __ ] like gotta tell
27:13 - me don't do this but i'm like i mean i
27:14 - don't know
27:15 - just you know why not you know so
27:19 - but but yeah so man that is amazing i'm
27:22 - so happy that makes me happy to hear the
27:23 - fact that you know
27:24 - someone who felt like there was no
27:27 - drive or you know no purpose to now
27:30 - someone who's
27:31 - actually has a purpose and towards the
27:33 - project and actually your partner on the
27:34 - project i'm guessing is what you're
27:35 - saying correct which is just that's
27:36 - correct which is just
27:37 - [ __ ] amazing man i'm so happy for you
27:39 - congratulations um thank you
27:41 - so so so awesome so you're building
27:44 - these projects you went to freelancer on
27:46 - network.com
27:47 - okay what's next what now leads you to
27:49 - like because at this point
27:51 - you're probably 18 years old now or
27:52 - something yeah so just turned 18
27:55 - um december got the 800 project figured
27:57 - out i could make you know some
27:59 - and my eyes good money i continued doing
28:02 - it so i had actually graduated high
28:03 - school a semester earlier
28:05 - early so december was my last month of
28:08 - school
28:08 - and um january i was completely free so
28:11 - i was like okay i've got to spend some
28:13 - time and figure out what i'm
28:14 - doing here because i've gotta register
28:16 - for college you know if i'm gonna go
28:18 - um i have to do it by like april or may
28:22 - because that's just a deadline so i was
28:24 - like i gotta figure something out quick
28:26 - and so i start taking on more freelance
28:28 - jobs still pretty small stuff i mean we
28:30 - may have gotten two
28:31 - thousand or two thousand dollar projects
28:33 - um around there
28:35 - and then march comes around and
28:38 - i was like you know what i need to be a
28:39 - little bit more professional let's set
28:40 - up a linkedin profile
28:42 - so set up a linkedin profile i connect
28:44 - with everybody i know like my teachers
28:46 - coaches that i knew like just like
28:48 - principals random stuff like friends
28:52 - just cats dogs
28:56 - and then so everybody knows the linkedin
28:58 - deal um
28:59 - you put software developer in your bio
29:01 - and you get blasted by 10 recruiters
29:03 - within the first week
29:05 - and so that's what happened to me
29:11 - guys here in oklahoma that um said hey
29:14 - we've got some positions we want you to
29:16 - take a look at and they're like can you
29:18 - send your resume
29:20 - thinking i don't have a resume i just
29:21 - started this six months ago like there's
29:23 - nothing to put on there
29:24 - and so i was just like okay i got to
29:26 - figure some out so i put a resume
29:27 - together i just throw in my freelance
29:29 - projects in there
29:30 - i threw them some some skill
29:34 - that i definitely didn't have like
29:35 - node.js and c-sharp i think i put on
29:38 - there
29:40 - i fill this in a little bit more right
29:42 - because it's gonna look super blank
29:44 - and so i sent it out to him and
29:46 - surprisingly they were both like okay we
29:48 - want to schedule an interview and one is
29:49 - in
29:50 - okc which is like an hour and a half
29:51 - from me and then one is
29:53 - five minutes from me mm-hmm um this and
29:56 - so
29:56 - you know i tell my mom hey i've got i've
29:58 - got interviews she's like
30:00 - what i was like well these
30:04 - recruiting companies and i remember she
30:06 - was like oh those are
30:07 - recruiters like it's a very normal thing
30:10 - they just they're they're headhunters
30:11 - they're going out trying to find people
30:12 - because they make money off of you
30:14 - and so she's like well it could be it'll
30:16 - still be a good experience to interview
30:18 - and so we had very low expectations so i
30:20 - go in there
30:21 - um interview at each of them
30:24 - the one in okc was a php job left went
30:27 - home a week later
30:28 - they asked me if they could talk to me
30:30 - again wow
30:31 - i wasn't really interested in the
30:32 - technology they were building it was
30:34 - like a cms system very boring
30:36 - and then the one in tulsa they're like
30:38 - okay we want you to talk to the owner of
30:39 - the company now
30:40 - so i went and had an interview with the
30:42 - owner of uh of the company that they
30:44 - were recruiting for
30:45 - [ __ ] and this was like
30:49 - i definitely think that there is some
30:51 - like perfect timing involved with all of
30:52 - this stuff
30:53 - right because the owner of this company
30:56 - it was funny how well we connected
30:58 - because he
30:59 - basically did the same thing when he was
31:01 - at 18
31:02 - he was like not really interested in
31:04 - college so he started learning to code
31:06 - he did end up finishing college later on
31:09 - but he learned to code and then started
31:10 - his own agency
31:12 - um very similar to how i how i have done
31:14 - it now
31:15 - wow he's been somebody that i've uh
31:17 - pulled a lot of plays from
31:19 - and so we connected very well at the
31:22 - start
31:22 - and ended up uh getting a contract to
31:25 - hire position
31:26 - for um six-month contract fifty thousand
31:30 - dollar salary
31:31 - um 18 year old 18 years old 18 years old
31:34 - yeah with a really bad resume and
31:38 - i had the guts they offered me 40 000 i
31:40 - told them i wouldn't do it unless they
31:42 - paid me 50.
31:43 - holy really damn you got guts man
31:48 - and because this is a good thing and a
31:50 - bad thing that i have is the confidence
31:53 - um sometimes when it comes to business
31:55 - stuff is like you know i was thinking i
31:57 - was like
31:57 - in my head this was so not true and in
32:00 - my head i was thinking i could make 50
32:02 - 000 a year doing
32:03 - freelance this year so i'm not going to
32:05 - like i'm not going to take 40.
32:08 - and i probably i probably could have
32:09 - made 50 000 but i definitely didn't have
32:11 - the work ethic back then to do that
32:14 - so i was like yeah i need 50 000. um
32:17 - but you but you had that mindset right
32:19 - you had the it's like uh what's a
32:21 - muhammad ali or what muhammad ali i
32:23 - think he's like he said that he was
32:25 - the best the best you know boxer
32:29 - yeah you know even even before he became
32:31 - one
32:32 - yeah he's the best in the world before
32:34 - he became one
32:36 - yeah it's good that's that's the
32:38 - mentality to have while also keeping
32:40 - yourself humble enough so whenever
32:42 - you're in situations to
32:43 - uh to you know back down from that that
32:46 - you do
32:46 - and so but i think when you're in
32:48 - negotiations and stuff like that
32:50 - uh i mean think of it you have a 50
32:53 - 50 probably 55 year old ceo has been in
32:56 - the industry for
32:58 - 30 years 30 40 years or so and you have
33:00 - some 18 year old kid come into your
33:02 - office with a shitty
33:03 - resume and say no i'm not taking 40 i
33:05 - want 50.
33:06 - and you know it i i really think it does
33:10 - it did something where it was like okay
33:13 - this kid has
33:14 - this this kid has guts if you want to do
33:15 - that yeah you know and so
33:18 - he um he agreed to it i started work a
33:21 - month later
33:22 - wow and just kind of took off from there
33:25 - i mean i had a six-month contract
33:27 - a month in um he said he wanted to this
33:30 - was the second negotiation piece he said
33:32 - he wanted to cut the con
33:33 - cut the contract and just go straight to
33:35 - employees
33:37 - yeah a month in and i said no i'd really
33:40 - like to continue the full six-month
33:42 - contract to see if this is something
33:43 - that i'm really interested in
33:44 - wow and so yeah because this was this
33:47 - was
33:47 - and in my head i'm thinking if i say yes
33:51 - to this
33:52 - right now i'm at 50 000. i don't want to
33:54 - be at 50 000. i want to be at 75 000.
33:56 - and so
33:57 - in my head i'm thinking okay if i say
34:00 - yes to this now this removes my ability
34:02 - to negotiate for at least the next year
34:04 - right because he's given me something
34:06 - yeah so i waited till the six months and
34:08 - then
34:08 - negotiated that higher and exactly
34:12 - so because in my head it didn't matter i
34:13 - was still getting paid either way it was
34:15 - just what i was classified as
34:16 - yeah and so go ahead no that's all i've
34:20 - got on that
34:20 - no it's i think it's just very
34:22 - interesting like
34:24 - how do you set up that mindset right of
34:26 - like of like okay because
34:28 - the hardest thing is like when you go
34:29 - into negotiations a lot of students that
34:32 - i see because we teach a lot of students
34:33 - of course right
34:34 - and those who's here are now watching
34:35 - you you guys are watching
34:37 - you know they might be lacking
34:38 - confidence like they've done projects
34:40 - they've done crazy stuff right
34:42 - but they're lacking confidence like even
34:45 - to be able to say like hey you know what
34:47 - i don't want to offer
34:48 - 40k i'm a monty 50k you don't like it go
34:50 - bye-bye you know it's like
34:52 - holy [ __ ] you know it's like um no
34:56 - that also that shows guts but to the
34:59 - other person what i've realized
35:00 - and that you know that text takes a very
35:03 - hard
35:04 - um strong-minded person to do this but
35:07 - when you do that
35:08 - you yourself not only get this power
35:10 - yourself belief in yourself you get that
35:12 - confidence yourself
35:12 - because when you go through those
35:14 - negotiations as you the more you
35:16 - the more you go through life where you
35:18 - don't back down
35:20 - no you set yourself up you set your
35:21 - standards up
35:23 - right yeah yeah has happened to me too
35:25 - right in negotiations as well and i was
35:27 - like no
35:27 - i don't want to do this i don't want to
35:29 - i feel like this is my value and so
35:31 - forth i want to keep this value right
35:34 - and now the question is
35:38 - how like what does it take to get
35:42 - is it just a matter of just like you
35:43 - know what just saying it
35:46 - and being afraid to not let go like what
35:48 - does it take to actually have the
35:50 - mentality
35:51 - so i i think there's a couple pieces to
35:53 - it right so i
35:54 - it's it's not that um i do think it is
35:58 - like you said a little bit of guts and
35:59 - definitely confidence but it's it's the
36:01 - core of it is understanding your value
36:03 - right so i would i would not have had
36:05 - that conversation and said
36:07 - i want 75k right away because i knew i
36:10 - was not worth that in my head i wasn't
36:12 - worth that yet
36:13 - and so i knew i was worth 50k because i
36:15 - looked at the average salary for
36:16 - developer and it was
36:18 - 75 85k in my area and i was like well
36:20 - i'm probably
36:21 - at least half of what they have in
36:22 - skills so i'm probably you know 45 50
36:25 - 000
36:26 - a year um and so that gave me some
36:28 - confidence there just kind of looking at
36:30 - the numbers and doing my research
36:31 - um but another part of it was just
36:35 - applying what i had already taught
36:36 - myself in other areas and i do this
36:38 - today still
36:39 - so um you know for example i i feel like
36:42 - i can
36:43 - go into a business room and full of
36:46 - business people
36:46 - and talk very confidently and have a
36:49 - really good meeting
36:50 - and be 100 confident however four months
36:52 - ago uh
36:54 - you know when i when i just started
36:55 - going to the gym i felt like
36:57 - i have no clue what i'm doing
36:59 - everybody's looking at me they all know
37:00 - i'm
37:00 - dumb and have no clue what i'm even
37:02 - doing i'm probably doing it wrong
37:05 - but i started thinking okay what was my
37:08 - mindset
37:08 - what is my mindset in work right my
37:10 - mindset and work is
37:12 - i don't care if i don't know what i what
37:14 - i'm doing i'm gonna learn it i'm gonna
37:15 - do the best i can
37:16 - and if i have to i'll ask other people
37:18 - for help and so as i started going to
37:20 - gym and keeping that same mindset
37:22 - i started working with trainers to get
37:23 - the knowledge started talking to friends
37:25 - to ask how they were doing things and
37:26 - watching them
37:27 - and really focusing on how can i become
37:30 - better and more confident here but that
37:32 - initial confidence from my business side
37:34 - i was able to easily translate it over
37:36 - so my tip for other people would be
37:37 - find what you are confident in it
37:39 - doesn't even have to be a career
37:41 - you know it could be whenever you read
37:43 - you feel really confident you feel
37:45 - really well about yourself and
37:46 - you feel like you can really understand
37:47 - what a book is about yeah translate that
37:49 - same thing
37:50 - over
37:53 - software development or your business so
37:55 - that you have that same mentality to say
37:58 - okay i got this i can figure this out
37:59 - yeah and it's actually very interesting
38:00 - because
38:01 - i see similar things when it comes to
38:02 - like being
38:04 - become a developer right and overcoming
38:06 - the impartial syndrome
38:08 - yeah because for example yeah to
38:11 - overcome the
38:11 - partial symptoms the way i like to think
38:13 - about it is like every single big
38:14 - every single beginner is going to have
38:16 - that right absolutely beginner's gonna
38:18 - feel like hey you know what i'm not
38:19 - worthy of this
38:20 - or because they just haven't had the
38:22 - experience yet it's no matter what you
38:23 - do
38:24 - yeah you know but what i say is like
38:27 - [ __ ] use that like yeah use that
38:30 - scarcity use that scare or do a fear
38:32 - right to push you forward but
38:34 - most importantly use what you've done
38:37 - previously
38:38 - because if you know for example you know
38:40 - that hey you know what
38:42 - blake here right you went ahead and you
38:44 - probably
38:46 - like you know you did you start you
38:48 - start freelance you did bitcoin stuff
38:49 - like that
38:50 - right you took that on yourself and no
38:53 - matter how hard it was
38:54 - you were able to get it yeah if you keep
38:58 - that mindset you know what
38:59 - i did this other stuff previously why
39:02 - can't i not do this
39:03 - why can't i do this yeah and think of
39:06 - the risk though because like
39:08 - you look at and you're like okay
39:11 - think of what you're think of the
39:13 - problem you're looking at whenever you
39:15 - say
39:15 - i don't i don't think i'm ready to start
39:17 - freelancing or start doing contracts or
39:19 - start developing
39:20 - think of what the what the failure could
39:22 - be so what
39:23 - you lose a hundred dollar client who
39:26 - cares like there's gonna be
39:28 - a thousand more and i have always tried
39:31 - to keep this mindset as like if
39:33 - something doesn't work out
39:36 - in the first initial stages and and it's
39:39 - you know maybe because you don't you
39:40 - don't know something
39:41 - there's always going to be one more
39:42 - thing like failure is not indefinite
39:44 - you're not going to
39:45 - um not do very good on a job and then
39:47 - just everything else is out the door
39:49 - there's always going to be more
39:50 - yeah it's just it's getting rid of that
39:52 - narrow mindset that's true that's true
39:54 - and so when do we when like when would
39:56 - you recommend for somebody for example
39:58 - you know a beginner developer like when
40:00 - should they get started into like
40:01 - freelancing let's say or even applying
40:04 - for jobs
40:05 - let's just start with freelancing at
40:06 - which point do you feel like
40:08 - you should be someone like you know what
40:09 - let's try it out
40:13 - 45 days i think 45 days into your to
40:16 - your learning period
40:17 - wow just because that's exactly what i
40:19 - did so i started on code academy
40:21 - around 30 days of that just very basic
40:23 - html css but
40:24 - that didn't teach me anything compared
40:26 - to what i learned while i was doing
40:27 - freelancing right and it was just making
40:29 - sure this is
40:30 - a key point here make sure that
40:33 - when you do start freelancing you're
40:35 - taking on very small pieces of work
40:39 - like not full websites like i did like
40:42 - very small things like maybe a
40:44 - plug-in upgrade on wordpress or static
40:46 - html site like simple things
40:48 - uh like css fix i remember i remember i
40:50 - did this once you says
40:52 - it was like three dollars i got i got
40:54 - paid three dollars for this like a
40:56 - small small css fix that took me like
40:58 - probably a day honestly to do
41:00 - but like holy [ __ ] you know i did it
41:02 - yeah
41:04 - i gotcha yeah and that's that's the
41:05 - thing it's like you pick up a job and
41:07 - you realize okay this is what they need
41:09 - and you do it and sooner or later you
41:10 - get six months a year in you've hit
41:12 - just about every technical use case that
41:15 - you could probably have right so you
41:18 - build a website you build a user system
41:21 - um check out process integrate an api
41:23 - like you hit enough of the core
41:24 - fundamentals
41:25 - that after that it's just changing up
41:28 - little pieces of it you're not really
41:29 - like even today
41:30 - end of the day yeah we know what we're
41:32 - doing but it's just a lot of core
41:34 - concepts and tweaking how we actually
41:36 - use them
41:37 - that is true that is true so that
41:40 - that is amazing that's amazing with you
41:42 - know what kind of got you started
41:44 - especially with
41:45 - with that guy and so now let's continue
41:47 - on right what happened with him after
41:49 - right
41:49 - you said that you know what i don't want
41:51 - to take that contract and so forth
41:53 - kind of what moves on next
41:57 - yeah so we get six months in we do
41:58 - another negotiation i become an employee
42:01 - with that company and we just you know
42:04 - we were able to form
42:05 - this kind of bond or relationship where
42:09 - he knew i had the ambition to do
42:10 - something much bigger like my
42:12 - he knew my end goal was not to be an
42:15 - employee the rest of my life right
42:16 - nothing wrong with that
42:17 - just it wasn't my interest and so um
42:21 - you know everything he would do i i just
42:24 - this is just part of what i do you know
42:25 - if i saw
42:27 - him doing something then i was like man
42:29 - how does he figure that out i would ask
42:30 - him
42:31 - how do you do this or like how do you
42:32 - how do you handle this stuff because one
42:33 - thing
42:34 - you'll realize is people who are uh
42:36 - where you want to be
42:37 - they want you to ask questions they like
42:39 - when people ask me questions about
42:41 - how do i get like this kind of stuff i
42:43 - love this i feed off of this kind of
42:45 - stuff because it's like
42:46 - if only i could tell myself this stuff
42:49 - four years ago think of where i could be
42:51 - right right and so
42:53 - you realize that like ceos owners of
42:56 - companies they want you to ask questions
42:57 - because it shows
42:58 - you're trying to be much more than just
43:00 - a resource
43:02 - yeah that's on the time sheet or
43:04 - whatever so
43:05 - you're trying to learn you're trying
43:06 - you're trying to it just
43:08 - you know it's it's a it's amazing to see
43:10 - somebody who
43:12 - is inspiring for someone is aspiring
43:14 - because like it makes them relate with
43:16 - them
43:16 - like right for example with that person
43:19 - right if i see someone who's like you
43:20 - know what
43:21 - either asking me questions or someone
43:23 - who's asking you questions right
43:24 - and they're like they're intrigued and
43:26 - they're trying their best like holy [ __ ]
43:28 - i want to help you out too you know
43:29 - it's like you give me 100 i'm going to
43:31 - give you 100 back
43:33 - exactly yeah and that's that's the whole
43:36 - deal and so that's that's what i kept
43:37 - doing was just
43:38 - i wanted to learn like it was something
43:40 - in me that actually wanted this
43:41 - information so i feel like it was really
43:43 - genuine when it came out and that's why
43:45 - what do you think what was it in you
43:47 - like what do you think was in you that
43:48 - like wanted to learn like what do you
43:50 - think was that like
43:51 - genetically or was it just a push what
43:53 - was it
43:54 - i think i just i think i knew i had more
43:57 - potential than what i was being used for
43:59 - and uh you know at the end of the day i
44:01 - would write i would write code
44:03 - and build applications or whatever and
44:05 - it was real it was cool but
44:07 - i just i felt like i had a bigger
44:09 - purpose than that so some people they
44:11 - have
44:11 - their purpose is to do those things and
44:13 - that's 100 okay and
44:15 - everybody we all need those people but
44:17 - for me it was always like
44:19 - think of the bitcoin stuff did i really
44:22 - care about
44:23 - bitcoin no um even now it's like
44:26 - do i necessarily do do i sit at home on
44:29 - the weekends and code all weekend
44:31 - absolutely not
44:32 - like def you will not see me
44:37 - you know custom code project anymore i
44:39 - haven't done that in years and i have no
44:40 - interest in doing it right
44:42 - and this so this is when i started
44:43 - figuring out a little bit more of um
44:45 - what i'm meant for and and where i want
44:47 - to be and so
44:48 - i started picking up that i really like
44:50 - business i like managing money like
44:52 - i like figuring out the nuances of how
44:55 - to get people to be confident in you and
44:57 - close a deal with somebody and
44:59 - set up all the resources for it like
45:00 - more of the architecture and management
45:03 - of a business
45:04 - than actually sitting there and writing
45:06 - code you're basically like the the steve
45:07 - jobs
45:09 - yeah so they put all the pieces together
45:11 - yeah he takes pieces from everybody else
45:13 - and
45:13 - puts it together in one thing you like
45:15 - that you like the comparison
45:17 - i think yeah i think yeah even though
45:19 - steve jobs was a dick
45:20 - i know but you won't really we won't
45:23 - relate that portion to you
45:25 - yeah fair enough fair enough but yeah
45:27 - and then i think that's um
45:29 - you know where where uh the owner of
45:31 - that company i really related we were
45:33 - able to
45:33 - i was able to ask a lot of questions
45:35 - that was like a gold mine for me i
45:36 - i saw somebody that had everything i had
45:38 - wanted and uh
45:40 - not not uh not like uh
45:43 - materialistically or anything it was
45:45 - everything that i wanted
45:47 - mentally like work and career-wise
45:48 - basically
45:50 - yeah like all the problems i had in my
45:51 - head that i couldn't solve he had the
45:53 - answers to all of them
45:54 - and so that's why i would always ask
45:55 - those questions it built a really good
45:57 - relationship even up until today
45:59 - right uh so that was a huge part of it
46:02 - you know one thing i see with you like
46:04 - one thing as as i pay attention
46:06 - in terms of like like
46:10 - one thing i see with you is that you you
46:12 - very much
46:13 - um gravity towards towards people you
46:15 - want to learn from of course and that
46:16 - makes sense
46:18 - but you like to learn from others
46:21 - yeah you're not that type of person from
46:23 - what i'm saying correct me if i'm wrong
46:24 - you know that person who's like you know
46:25 - what
46:25 - i'm just doing all by myself this is me
46:27 - i'm going to figure this out all but
46:29 - full of my full by myself and that's
46:30 - pretty much it
46:32 - i feel like from what i'm hearing is
46:33 - like you're like hey you know i had this
46:34 - other person to learn from him
46:36 - i had this i'm going to learn from this
46:37 - person right nonstop
46:39 - and that just upgrades you like a like
46:42 - like nothing else
46:43 - yeah yeah and i think that's i actually
46:45 - had a i feel like i had a big problem
46:47 - with that starting off was i felt like i
46:48 - could do everything myself because
46:50 - these things started happening and i
46:51 - started getting super cocky because i
46:53 - was
46:53 - 18 and i was like oh i'm this is all
46:56 - working like i can do all this myself
46:58 - i start working for the company and it
47:00 - was more on a technical level
47:01 - i remember always going in and instantly
47:04 - being pissed off when somebody would say
47:06 - my stuff is wrong because i know it's
47:08 - not my stuff's always right like there's
47:09 - no way
47:10 - and then they'd prove me wrong every
47:11 - single time and that humbled me a lot
47:13 - and told me yeah be confident in what
47:16 - you've got
47:17 - at the end of the day listen to other
47:18 - people if they know more than you
47:20 - realize that and listen to them true so
47:22 - that's big part of what what i had to
47:23 - learn
47:24 - even if they don't know more than you
47:26 - even that because
47:28 - here's what i mean by that i'm a teacher
47:30 - and i still learn a lot from my students
47:33 - yeah right like even in some cases like
47:35 - you don't know everything sometimes
47:37 - the student can't become the teacher in
47:39 - some cases right but there's some things
47:41 - that you just don't know because that
47:42 - person might know something else
47:44 - right you think even in those cases i
47:46 - think that's applicable too
47:47 - and i myself i work with i'll be
47:50 - honestly i've worked with some [ __ ]
47:52 - developers i'll be fully honest with you
47:54 - right developers who like you know what
47:56 - it
47:57 - who are like this is all perfect i got
47:59 - this done
48:00 - i had this i was working with this one
48:01 - developer who uh i'm not gonna name the
48:03 - names of course but
48:04 - um literally change the whole back end
48:08 - within two weeks didn't say anything
48:10 - to any of the front end people nor
48:12 - anybody in the business
48:13 - change the whole back and push that live
48:15 - broke everything that's alive
48:17 - and said that it was our front
48:18 - front-end's fault
48:20 - and when we asked hey can we fix it
48:22 - together that person was like no
48:24 - it's a documentation you guys should be
48:25 - able to figure it out
48:27 - yeah yeah i see those people all the
48:29 - time still yeah
48:31 - like what the [ __ ] yeah you just messed
48:34 - up
48:34 - it's messed people who don't care yeah
48:36 - nobody wants to work with those people
48:38 - so that's the one thing
48:38 - i think you could take from this is
48:40 - being humble and i see
48:42 - you being very humble like you're very
48:43 - confident but also very humble right
48:45 - you know kind and humble at the same
48:47 - time if you can put those two together
48:49 - you know that's a perfect combination
48:50 - now i'm very curious like at which point
48:52 - did you realize did you make that change
48:54 - or like
48:55 - no my stuff is always right to you know
48:57 - what i'm actually
48:59 - i i can be wrong sometimes at which
49:01 - point did you realize that it was just
49:02 - over time that that happened
49:04 - i think over time it gradually changed
49:07 - in what aspects i started to realize it
49:09 - more
49:09 - um you know it started off with code and
49:12 - realizing hey i can definitely be wrong
49:14 - when it comes to code
49:16 - as time went on it evolved into you know
49:20 - with some of the freelancing work maybe
49:21 - i'm not managing this relationship
49:23 - correctly
49:24 - as soon as i got developers on my team
49:26 - and
49:27 - you know it's very easy to say to point
49:29 - at the developer because they're doing
49:31 - it
49:31 - and and you're just managing the job to
49:33 - say oh you did
49:38 - that or to you know point fingers it's
49:40 - much easier to do that so
49:42 - that's when i realized like hey i've got
49:44 - a i've got to be a leader here you know
49:45 - i have to realize that some of these
49:47 - things are my fault like part of being a
49:48 - leader
49:49 - is when something fails inside of your
49:50 - team it's your fault
49:52 - at the end of the day because you failed
49:53 - to do something that could have
49:55 - prevented it in the past and that's a
49:56 - big thing that helped me with my
49:58 - team is when we missed the deadline i
50:00 - could have prevented that somehow
50:02 - right because i'm the first one to get
50:03 - to it i could have set the expectations
50:05 - different with the client
50:06 - i could have hired more people to help
50:08 - with the job
50:09 - so i think really once i got into my
50:11 - agency that's when my
50:13 - uh my shift and and how i how i thought
50:16 - about these things happened
50:18 - um as it grew that's amazing and how did
50:21 - you like learn
50:22 - from on this type of stuff right because
50:24 - at the end of the day
50:26 - you know these soft skills the
50:28 - leadership skills
50:29 - right it doesn't just happen out of
50:31 - nowhere sometimes it does
50:32 - but like a lot of the times it's like
50:34 - maybe you might find culture like
50:36 - where did you learn that specifically
50:39 - i think the soft skills have been i mean
50:41 - when i was
50:43 - 14 i had a photography business i had
50:46 - t-shirts i was doing all the school
50:48 - photography
50:49 - really you did photography too yeah holy
50:52 - [ __ ]
50:52 - freshman i shot all the sports events
50:56 - football
50:57 - basketball baseball i did prom
51:00 - homecoming all that shot photos for it
51:02 - and then sold them
51:03 - on my website um i had like a
51:05 - squarespace or something whatever it was
51:07 - back then
51:08 - um and doing that that that taught me
51:10 - how to start communicating with people
51:12 - um i did yearbook all throughout high
51:14 - school so i was
51:15 - writing editorial pieces um for four
51:18 - years and interviewing people that way
51:20 - and then um you know afterwards you and
51:24 - and let's say you don't have some of
51:25 - that experience it's not impossible to
51:27 - get it still i mean
51:28 - it's it's super easy to correlate when
51:30 - you're doing something right when you're
51:31 - doing something wrong
51:32 - closed deal means you're doing something
51:34 - right lose a deal
51:36 - lost deal means okay either it wasn't
51:39 - meant to be or potentially you did
51:40 - something wrong so make sure you look at
51:42 - potentially what you could have done
51:43 - wrong
51:45 - in this business it's super easy to
51:46 - figure out are you doing good are you
51:48 - doing bad because if
51:50 - you know you're if your majority of your
51:52 - deals that you're working are
51:53 - lost compared to one you're probably
51:55 - doing something wrong
51:56 - results speak for themselves exactly as
51:59 - simple as that
52:00 - but you know what the interesting thing
52:01 - is like you mentioned this whole
52:03 - photograph so your business goes back to
52:04 - not just like coding it goes back to
52:06 - photography
52:07 - so you were like i was thinking that
52:09 - brought me to the idea of like gary
52:10 - vaynerchuk garyvee you know
52:12 - he was like selling them and they stand
52:13 - and stuff like that you know so like
52:14 - your business kind of knowledge
52:17 - was was brought up very early on
52:20 - yeah i mean like seventh grade i had
52:23 - this thing where
52:24 - i found out you could buy uh replica
52:26 - beats headphones on dhgate
52:28 - and dude i'd show up to school i'd have
52:30 - like six of them around my neck and i'd
52:31 - be delivering them out
52:32 - i still have facebook messages from
52:34 - people hitting me up like hey i'll give
52:36 - you 110 bucks for this pair of studios
52:38 - i was like all right what color you want
52:39 - ordered them through my mom's account
52:42 - come from china deliver them and i'd
52:44 - bring them to school
52:45 - so you sold fake beat studios huh yeah
52:48 - yeah when i was
52:49 - i had it in like 12 or 13 back then i
52:51 - think that was like the
52:52 - first thing i ever really did wow so
52:54 - that's where your guts came from
52:57 - yeah i guess for me i was just like
52:59 - shoot
53:00 - everybody wants beats because they're
53:01 - cool so you know
53:03 - let's give them to them for a third of
53:05 - the price and my whole thing was
53:07 - they're not fake they're replicas
53:12 - nobody knows better they're like oh
53:13 - replicas are the same thing so
53:15 - i gotcha i gotcha and they're like
53:16 - everybody's like my mom i got i got
53:18 - these new beats for only ten dollars you
53:20 - know
53:21 - yeah yeah exactly that's awesome that's
53:24 - amazing wow so that that's it
53:25 - i did not know that about you that's
53:27 - really interesting so
53:29 - so okay so you went ahead and of course
53:32 - you were working with with him and then
53:34 - of course you saw potential in you and
53:35 - so forth
53:37 - and then at which point now did you
53:39 - realize that you know what
53:41 - i want to do something different i want
53:42 - to start my own freelance agency or
53:44 - you know or my own business i just got
53:47 - fed up
53:48 - honestly i was i was extremely
53:50 - frustrated so i made it two years into
53:52 - that company
53:54 - before i started switching things over
53:56 - switching you know kind of my mindset
53:57 - with things but
53:58 - i remember what happened was um it's
54:01 - funny because
54:02 - his son actually was like hey we were
54:03 - talking in the office one day and he was
54:05 - like have you ever been to miami
54:06 - i was like no and he's like you should
54:08 - go like okay
54:10 - so i schedule i schedule a trip
54:12 - literally like the next week for a
54:13 - couple days next weekend to go to miami
54:15 - for a couple days
54:16 - and i go and it just instantly opened up
54:18 - my eyes
54:19 - because it was like i stayed at a really
54:22 - nice hotel
54:22 - everybody i saw there you know you walk
54:24 - out of the hotel you see
54:25 - three lambos everybody's flashy you know
54:28 - it's like material heaven there if you
54:31 - like material stuff you go there and
54:33 - it's just like
54:33 - yep like heaven right and so
54:37 - i show up there and i see everybody
54:38 - they're working hard they look really
54:40 - good everybody's fit they look happy
54:42 - the weather is perfect and i was like
54:44 - this is where i've got to be like this
54:45 - is it
54:46 - and so why why is is it because like you
54:48 - felt like that's what you
54:49 - you want to be near the materialistic
54:52 - portion what was that drive
54:54 - or you just you just felt rich at first
54:56 - that's what i thought success was
54:58 - right it was that kind of stuff so i
55:00 - went there and i was like everybody is
55:02 - successful i want to be successful
55:04 - so therefore this this is like this what
55:07 - they have the lambos the way they look
55:08 - this is the clothes they're wearing
55:10 - this is success in my eyes back then and
55:12 - so that's why i was like all right i've
55:14 - got to move there because oklahoma
55:15 - doesn't have this i mean
55:16 - literally you look outside my window and
55:18 - it's a field of grass
55:21 - i mean for some people that's heaven for
55:23 - some people they're like
55:25 - it's a place to grow stuff you know who
55:26 - knows yeah
55:28 - sure it wasn't for me back then
55:32 - but so i would you know i saw that i was
55:34 - like wow i got to do this and so i come
55:35 - back
55:36 - and i remember having a discussion with
55:38 - my boss and saying hey
55:40 - you know i i'd really like to work
55:42 - remote because
55:43 - um you know i want to move to miami and
55:47 - he he kind of understood the tone he was
55:49 - like you're gonna do it
55:51 - whether i let you or promote or not
55:53 - aren't you right i was like yeah either
55:54 - way i'm doing it
55:55 - wow and it was just like i knew i had to
55:58 - do it because that's where that's what
55:59 - was gonna take me to my next stage
56:01 - feb so november was my first trip there
56:04 - um went back three more times
56:06 - february i was moved there moved all my
56:08 - stuff from tulsa to there
56:10 - even still had an apartment in tulsa
56:11 - that i had a lease on um that i was like
56:13 - i'm not finishing this
56:14 - like i'm dipping out i'll pay for both
56:16 - at the same time if i have to
56:18 - that's sick and that's when i went to
56:20 - miami and
56:22 - it miami in itself is like
56:26 - a whole hour conversation but you know
56:29 - the thing with it is like
56:31 - it was two years i had very little
56:33 - social interaction it was probably the
56:35 - hardest time mentally
56:37 - for me that i've ever experienced
56:39 - because uh
56:40 - you know think of think of somebody in
56:42 - miami that doesn't
56:44 - never drink alcohol i don't party
56:47 - um i was really focused on my career
56:51 - everybody where i lived was partying
56:54 - every night
56:54 - extremely social people for an introvert
56:57 - it's probably one of the worst places
56:58 - you can be
56:59 - really and so it was extremely tough
57:02 - because
57:02 - i'm working from home working in my
57:04 - apartment until i got an office later on
57:06 - um but it
57:09 - it was it was like i had no no friends
57:11 - like nobody like i'd call my friends
57:12 - back home or whatever and
57:14 - i remember i'd i'd literally fly back to
57:16 - oklahoma usually once or tw
57:17 - once a month or once every other month
57:19 - because
57:20 - i would get so tapped out i would be
57:22 - there alone for a month
57:23 - just working 12 hours a day on my
57:25 - computer and
57:27 - go to sleep and i just forgot you know
57:29 - what day it was every day
57:30 - because there's just this loop
57:34 - but that built some insane work ethic so
57:37 - when i came back here and was able to
57:40 - you know rejoin with all my friends
57:41 - and you know family and stuff
57:45 - it was like it built something in me
57:48 - that no matter where i go or what
57:50 - environment i'm in
57:52 - i will always be focused like with my
57:54 - work um
57:57 - so long i was like oh i can't be focused
57:58 - in oklahoma i need to be in miami
58:00 - and now it's like i'm more focused than
58:02 - i was in miami here because of what that
58:03 - built me into
58:04 - so so
58:09 - why why do you think that in miami you
58:12 - couldn't find potential people like
58:14 - yourself like
58:15 - like why did you feel so so alone right
58:18 - so
58:19 - because i'm sure there's different
58:20 - things you probably could have done
58:22 - right
58:22 - there are that's that's a really good
58:25 - point actually
58:26 - and that's what i was actually thinking
58:27 - about this couple days ago i was like
58:29 - man if i was in miami now
58:31 - i probably could have met a lot more
58:32 - people that that were similar to me
58:35 - um but i think it was just something
58:38 - that i had to go through mentally to
58:39 - understand like the first phase was
58:41 - i thought i couldn't be in oklahoma to
58:43 - be successful or to work
58:44 - to work hard and grow my business so i
58:46 - moved to miami i went to miami and
58:48 - realized
58:49 - i can't really meet people here came
58:51 - back to oklahoma
58:52 - and was still kind of like eh i haven't
58:55 - really
58:55 - met anybody new here like everybody's
58:58 - kind of doing things so what's the
58:59 - problem here
59:00 - and i realized that you know maybe i
59:02 - need to start doing different things
59:03 - like
59:03 - i went to the gym and now i show up to
59:05 - the gym and every single day i go there
59:07 - i know at least three or four people
59:09 - i could have done the same thing in
59:10 - miami and met very like-minded people
59:12 - but i just think it was the phase of
59:14 - where my mind was that
59:15 - didn't allow me to go out and meet those
59:17 - people because i didn't think that i
59:19 - could really do it
59:20 - um i think the odds were against me too
59:23 - partially in miami i think a majority of
59:24 - people
59:25 - were um not like-minded and that i got
59:28 - kind of tired
59:29 - of when i did meet somebody it was just
59:32 - you know it was the epitome of what
59:36 - not to be around so i just kind of got
59:38 - tired and was like you know what no
59:39 - none of this is good for me so i think
59:43 - one don't put yourself into an
59:44 - environment where the odds are very much
59:46 - against you
59:47 - yeah that's the easiest way to avoid it
59:48 - but you're always going to have
59:49 - abilities to
59:50 - true people but the same thing you don't
59:52 - know you never know yeah
59:54 - like you never know like you know what
59:56 - move might be the right move
59:58 - yeah and and so on the miami piece like
60:00 - i say i never really met anybody
60:02 - there were like three or four people
60:05 - that
60:06 - are very close people to me now that i
60:08 - may have hung out with
60:10 - 10 times but i still talk to him this
60:12 - day
60:13 - one of them was a work client that i met
60:16 - in miami because he found me on
60:17 - instagram and we met up
60:19 - and we ended up doing a deployment
60:22 - where uh he flew me out to new york and
60:25 - we deployed it in the world trade center
60:26 - wow like no way you're talking about
60:29 - like i may not have had like a lot of
60:31 - buddies people to go out with and stuff
60:33 - but some of the
60:34 - some of the stuff i i did do with the
60:37 - close people there
60:38 - was were things i'll remember for the
60:39 - rest of my life i think that's what's
60:40 - super important too i think it's
60:42 - important to consider honestly right and
60:44 - it's
60:44 - it's not to downplay miami right i know
60:46 - that miami you felt probably like very
60:47 - lonely
60:48 - but it's a lot of times it's not the
60:50 - amount of friends that you have it's the
60:51 - quality of people that you have around
60:52 - you
60:53 - yeah right so like even for me here in
60:55 - l.a i'll be honest with you i don't know
60:56 - too many people
60:57 - yeah yeah but the people that i know are
61:01 - [ __ ] epic you know like i am the
61:04 - happiest i've ever been
61:06 - yep good right and it's like as long as
61:09 - you surround yourself around those
61:10 - people and like
61:11 - as long as you push yourself to even
61:13 - those even those those
61:14 - few that that come around i feel like
61:17 - that's
61:18 - that is what makes up forever for
61:19 - everything else honestly right now
61:21 - now so now time with this right so
61:23 - you're in miami correct and
61:26 - you have at this point are you still
61:27 - working for that tulsa company or
61:30 - are you yeah okay now from what i
61:32 - remember you started your
61:34 - mods agency at that point is that
61:35 - correct that's right so
61:38 - literally as soon as i moved to miami uh
61:40 - we started it up it was like january i
61:43 - had the
61:43 - business license wow and where was that
61:47 - where was that from like where is it
61:49 - like did you so you told me you were fed
61:50 - up with the other company right
61:52 - and what what else pushed you was like
61:54 - you wanted to build something bigger
61:55 - what was it
61:56 - and to be clear i wasn't fed up with the
61:57 - other company i was just i was
61:59 - so the main reasons that i had left was
62:02 - like i saw miami was really cool
62:03 - i didn't like working in an office it
62:05 - just felt like i was not using my
62:06 - potential
62:07 - um and there were a couple you know
62:10 - relationships that
62:11 - that were in tulsa that i i viewed as
62:14 - toxic and that i wanted to get away from
62:16 - um and so that helped moving to miami
62:18 - was just super easy to
62:20 - just disconnect from all of it right
62:22 - yeah um so
62:24 - but yeah still worked remotely for them
62:26 - what was the last part of your question
62:27 - the last part the last part was like you
62:29 - know then
62:30 - then what else was it that pushed you to
62:32 - create your own your own company
62:34 - besides you just want to move to miami i
62:36 - think i mean think of the numbers that's
62:38 - that's the easiest way is like i thought
62:40 - in my head because i had done freelance
62:41 - i had started um
62:43 - you know basically what i did was i was
62:44 - doing freelance and i kept getting jobs
62:46 - where i couldn't handle enough of it so
62:47 - i'd hire another freelancer to do part
62:49 - of it and pay them
62:50 - a portion of what i got right so i just
62:52 - thought of it and i was like
62:54 - what am i doing sitting here when i
62:56 - don't even really enjoy the
62:57 - like a whole lot of the code aspect it's
63:00 - like why am i sitting here
63:02 - doing this um when i could
63:05 - run an agency and just find the deals
63:08 - close them because that's what i really
63:10 - enjoy and then get other people to
63:12 - actually
63:12 - develop them and that's when it clicked
63:15 - for me because i was thinking in my head
63:16 - okay if i charge
63:18 - um let's say 50 bucks an hour if i
63:20 - charge 50 bucks an hour to the client
63:22 - i find a developer for 25 an hour every
63:24 - single hour that gets worked
63:26 - i'm getting 25 hours for 25 dollars for
63:28 - and i'm not working that hour
63:30 - yeah uh you quickly realize that it's
63:32 - not that simple of a calculation
63:34 - right if there
63:37 - would be no point in being an agency if
63:39 - all you did was middleman the deal
63:41 - that's not what an agency does
63:42 - um i probably work way more than i do
63:45 - did then
63:46 - like when i started my agency so
63:50 - a lot different than you think but
63:51 - that's the numbers were a very clear
63:53 - sign for me to start in ages what were
63:55 - some of the the most
63:57 - toughest projects that you have to do
63:58 - though like you either are lost on
64:01 - or you're like holy [ __ ] what the [ __ ]
64:03 - is this right what was that the toughest
64:05 - part like
64:05 - because i know the beginning is usually
64:06 - the hardest right
64:10 - the hardest was probably first
64:13 - first probably year of it wasn't that
64:16 - bad
64:17 - um the second year we got a project
64:21 - where we
64:22 - like we had two projects actually this
64:24 - was the project that um
64:26 - when you were in miami we were stayed up
64:28 - for four days working on
64:30 - this was the first one that was really
64:31 - bad um we had
64:33 - under quoted it and we did a fixed price
64:40 - um and underestimated the timeline very
64:43 - bad
64:44 - yeah and so you know we're three or four
64:46 - weeks in
64:47 - to the project and we're just super
64:48 - behind and we're working all day every
64:49 - day
64:51 - to get it done and i obviously had to
64:54 - pay
64:55 - developers to develop the product and i
64:57 - wasn't getting paid anymore
64:58 - um and i think we ended up uh
65:02 - underestimating by a hundred percent
65:05 - so we had basically uh used up
65:08 - all the profit and all of the all the
65:09 - money we got paid for so we
65:11 - zeroed out i think we even lost a little
65:12 - bit of money on it wow um
65:14 - and spent all these days uh you know
65:17 - pushing super hard and
65:19 - pushing everybody really really bad and
65:20 - then uh
65:22 - you know that that taught me a lesson
65:24 - there don't do i don't do fixed price
65:25 - anymore
65:26 - um hourly i learned my lesson there too
65:29 - yeah pretty much everybody does um once
65:32 - you get to that point it's just not
65:33 - we're not worth doing fixed price
65:35 - yeah yeah second project was actually
65:39 - about a year and a half ago we had a
65:43 - lady come to us that wanted a applica a
65:45 - reporting application built
65:48 - seemed pretty easy and we she i didn't
65:51 - want to do the job though because i
65:52 - didn't really like her attitude
65:53 - um i didn't i didn't like the way that
65:55 - she she talked to me and and
65:57 - and kind of wanted to manage the upfront
66:00 - of the project
66:01 - so i was just like okay you know i'm not
66:04 - doing this so she just kept following up
66:05 - with me
66:05 - like every day she'd follow up like hey
66:07 - we want to work with you guys like that
66:09 - wow and so i just finally was like okay
66:11 - find
66:12 - a number then i was like oh this is you
66:14 - know random random number that i thought
66:16 - was good for the project i didn't do my
66:17 - due diligence on looking into it
66:19 - um and she took it and we started doing
66:23 - the project
66:24 - and we get to the point where we're like
66:29 - deadline is september 1st it's september
66:31 - 1st and we're not
66:32 - we're not close yet we need like another
66:34 - month
66:35 - so you know she stops paying us and
66:39 - i obviously have the obligation to fill
66:41 - the contract feel the deal because it
66:42 - was a fixed deal
66:45 - and so i lost a ton of money there um
66:48 - there's actually a third one
66:49 - this last one i'll mention this one is
66:51 - really really bad
66:54 - so those were minor those were like
66:55 - maybe maybe 10 15 000
66:58 - lost lost lost yeah so
67:01 - so not even not even zeroed out lost
67:03 - additional
67:04 - um and so this other one
67:08 - we had got a contract with um
67:11 - with this company that you know had
67:13 - recently gotten a lot of funding young
67:15 - ceo
67:16 - uh racking in like a million bucks a
67:18 - month in funding uh from different vc
67:20 - firms
67:21 - so they were doing really well and so we
67:23 - start on we bring like four developers
67:24 - on our team
67:25 - um we started billing them first week
67:29 - invoice uh payment fails and
67:33 - we're like okay that's weird but we we
67:35 - keep going with it so
67:37 - even though i failed you're still like
67:39 - paying developers you're still putting
67:40 - the project yeah
67:41 - yeah because i was like okay this is you
67:43 - know we're talking
67:45 - at that time we're 90 bucks an hour 40
67:47 - 160 hours of developer
67:50 - you can do the math i mean 16k times 4
67:53 - 64 000 a month you're doing pretty good
67:55 - so in my head i'm like oh it's fine
67:57 - we'll make bank off this right yeah and
67:59 - so you know we're rolling
68:00 - we start getting paid it works you know
68:02 - everything's fine after that
68:04 - you know six months goes by payments
68:06 - start to slow down
68:07 - and they get less and less and less and
68:09 - less and
68:10 - um in terms of in terms of cost in terms
68:13 - of like how much they pay you
68:15 - yeah so we would let's say we billed for
68:16 - 20k we'd get paid 12k
68:18 - and i was like like okay we'll get it
68:19 - next next two weeks because
68:21 - this next round of funding comes in it'd
68:23 - always be the next round of funding
68:24 - and so we built this balance up to where
68:26 - it was like 55k um
68:28 - of what they owed and uh was out to us
68:32 - right
68:32 - so all these lawsuits started coming out
68:36 - against them um for for misusing
68:38 - investor funds
68:39 - so they ended up uh their business
68:42 - wasn't even actually that good
68:44 - it was that they were just pulling all
68:45 - these money from investors and what
68:46 - happens with vc firms a lot of the times
68:48 - is once one vc sees that they've
68:49 - that a company's got an invested
68:51 - investment the other vc doesn't want to
68:52 - lose out on it so they give them an
68:54 - investment as well
68:56 - and so that's the cycle of of these ceos
68:58 - who are
68:59 - investment angels is because they just
69:01 - get the hype from all these vc firms
69:03 - and so this is what this guy was doing
69:05 - and we ended up losing about 55 000
69:07 - bucks on it
69:08 - it was never unvoiced and [ __ ] yeah
69:11 - october i cleared their invoices off my
69:13 - book i had them on there for a year
69:14 - and just wrote them off so holy [ __ ]
69:18 - yeah that was the worst one that is safe
69:20 - but honestly
69:21 - it doesn't compare to the upside
69:25 - of what i'm guessing you probably made
69:26 - from all the other projects
69:28 - right well yeah yeah definitely so i
69:31 - mean
69:32 - it's it's and even with that project
69:36 - the technique we were owed another 55
69:39 - 000.
69:40 - we didn't get paid but we did get paid
69:41 - 200 000 out of it so we paid 200k
69:44 - we didn't get paid 50k so we still
69:46 - didn't necessarily
69:47 - lose out oh we just kind of get what we
69:49 - were owed gotcha
69:51 - gotcha that's not that's still that bad
69:52 - 200k we pay that's still not bad
69:54 - probably but yes
69:55 - of course you're still paying your
69:56 - developers and stuff like that right so
69:57 - exactly yeah huge expense yeah of course
69:58 - of course of course
70:00 - awesome so we got a lot of people but
70:02 - joining this stream a lot of people are
70:03 - asking a bunch of questions which i'm
70:04 - going to take a look at later on but
70:06 - so so that that is i mean let me ask you
70:08 - this question like
70:10 - like um while you're building this like
70:12 - what were
70:13 - what were some of the toughest things
70:14 - that i want to go through you know
70:16 - the good things the bad things of of
70:18 - being a freelancer
70:20 - right like and just having your agency
70:23 - let's start with what were some of the
70:25 - good things when you when you started
70:26 - this right you went from working for
70:28 - someone
70:28 - to now doing some things on your own
70:30 - what are some of the positives you saw
70:34 - i'm gonna i'm gonna mention one thing
70:35 - because i think this is this is valuable
70:37 - before we get into that
70:38 - so um while i was starting my agency i
70:40 - never quit my full-time job
70:42 - right and another super interesting
70:44 - piece is i also still haven't quit
70:46 - that same agency job so i'm right now
70:49 - you're still working with them still
70:51 - working with them four years ago wow
70:53 - and i think this is a super important
70:55 - thing for people to realize is a lot of
70:57 - people think
70:58 - oh to run my own business i have to quit
70:59 - everything you don't you really don't i
71:01 - mean i've been doing this for four years
71:03 - and i haven't quit
71:04 - literally i haven't quit that position i
71:05 - haven't i haven't had to stop really
71:07 - anything
71:08 - i've just figured out how to handle how
71:09 - to architect all of it so that people
71:10 - still get what they need
71:12 - and they still feel like everything is
71:13 - fair
71:15 - so to kind of dive into now starting off
71:18 - uh you know what were some of the pros
71:21 - of it i guess
71:24 - you know obviously you get to be your
71:27 - own boss theoretically
71:28 - but at the end of the day your clients
71:30 - become your boss so i'm not really a pro
71:32 - people think it is but it's not um
71:35 - a little bit more flexibility because i
71:37 - did establish that relationship with the
71:39 - company
71:40 - in oklahoma that i was working remote
71:42 - out and did tell them that hey i'm going
71:44 - to start my own agency
71:45 - so they were aware of it definitely got
71:48 - more flexibility out of that
71:50 - a lot more scale like scalability and
71:52 - opportunity
71:53 - because i knew i could you know get two
71:56 - more deals and
71:57 - double my income for the year right so i
72:00 - knew i could make a lot more
72:02 - with with hopefully a lot less effort
72:05 - the con was really figuring out what an
72:08 - agency meant
72:09 - um at first i thought an agency was just
72:12 - this kind of
72:12 - holding company type deal where uh you
72:16 - just
72:16 - hired developers and they magically did
72:18 - the work perfectly
72:20 - and what you realize is developers take
72:22 - a lot of
72:23 - management um yeah to to get something
72:26 - done
72:26 - successfully because developer
72:29 - developers are very
72:30 - um logical people so you you give them a
72:33 - set of instructions and they follow the
72:35 - instructions to the t
72:36 - if you give them the wrong set of
72:37 - instructions they will follow those
72:39 - wrong
72:39 - instructions to the t and you'll end up
72:41 - with something that's not right
72:42 - and so figuring out how to manage those
72:44 - people and figuring out how to how to
72:47 - work with different attitudes and work
72:48 - styles and
72:50 - time time zone differences um that was
72:53 - definitely a challenge
72:54 - and the the first major challenge that
72:57 - happened
72:57 - was when i assigned a developer to a
72:59 - project and then they just disappeared
73:02 - like they literally just dip i had that
73:04 - happen probably 10 times where
73:06 - um hired somebody we had it happen in
73:08 - november
73:10 - we hired somebody and we got to the day
73:12 - before deployment and they disappeared
73:14 - they were gone um could you deploy it
73:17 - could you deploy
73:18 - that point or no well what happened was
73:20 - i had to build it that night i had to
73:22 - build a whole mvp for
73:23 - um the deployment the next day so
73:26 - yeah and it happens it happens all the
73:29 - time it doesn't matter what part of the
73:30 - business you're in you're going to have
73:32 - people that just
73:33 - you know they it's like what we
73:36 - talked about before those are the kind
73:37 - of people that are really confident but
73:39 - they don't deliver
73:40 - i always try to be confident and always
73:42 - deliver yeah
73:43 - that's what happens in the end that's
73:44 - honestly that's what matters in the end
73:46 - if you don't deliver then what's the
73:47 - point of
73:48 - everything else you just did right
73:50 - obviously it's like
73:51 - if you were learning you learning coding
73:54 - and then you didn't get a coding job
73:56 - yeah or did you do anything with it
73:58 - right you know there's no point to it
74:00 - no yeah of course not so so that that
74:03 - that to me
74:03 - is of course is is really interesting
74:07 - now my thing is now solo for example
74:11 - okay so
74:12 - so that's the con
74:15 - a lot of people think that for example
74:16 - it's very glamorous right to to become
74:18 - like
74:18 - this freelancer yeah right you guys you
74:22 - know
74:22 - you get to uh you know you get to travel
74:24 - around the world you know you get to
74:25 - make millions of dollars you know
74:28 - you get to meet all these people you
74:30 - have a lot of time on your hands and so
74:33 - forth
74:33 - it's a lot of people i hear is they go
74:35 - into this kind of like thinking about
74:37 - that
74:37 - is it like that
74:40 - no it's definitely not i think that's
74:41 - the that's the thing that
74:43 - sucks about social media too is because
74:46 - it's
74:47 - and i have a hard time with this because
74:48 - i know i can sometimes give off the
74:51 - give off the vibe that it's easy you
74:53 - know
74:54 - instagram name is easy so and the cars
74:58 - whatever else it's like people don't see
75:02 - uh you know stuff behind that they don't
75:04 - they don't realize that
75:05 - uh you know how much how many times
75:07 - about banging my head against the wall
75:09 - because
75:10 - i was pissed off or something wasn't
75:11 - working right or a client dropped me
75:14 - or i had to worry about i mean dude when
75:16 - i first started i remember
75:17 - literally there was no room for error i
75:20 - would get paid by a client
75:21 - pay the developer and back down to zero
75:24 - in my account wow pay by the client
75:26 - pay the developer like there there was
75:28 - so many of those times where now it's
75:30 - like
75:31 - yeah we can you know rack in 30 40k in a
75:33 - week
75:34 - and it's great and and people see
75:36 - they're like wow that's sick
75:38 - but they don't see when four years ago
75:41 - when i was at zero
75:42 - going up to 2k sending it to developer 0
75:44 - 2k
75:45 - up and down it's it's really not
75:47 - glamorous at all
75:49 - if anything you're going to going to be
75:51 - a lot
75:52 - more stressful going the freelancer
75:54 - route
75:55 - than it will be just working for a
75:56 - company that's why you see majority
75:58 - people
75:59 - working for companies is because it's a
76:01 - lot more comfortable but
76:03 - the reverse of that is if you do
76:05 - freelance
76:06 - uh and let's say you run an agency the
76:09 - scale is so much higher and that's what
76:11 - that's what for me i was like okay it's
76:12 - worth it
76:13 - i'm okay to go like i can go through the
76:15 - pain and struggles of doing this because
76:17 - it's worth it for me in the end
76:18 - some people it's not some people they'd
76:20 - rather work for a company and
76:22 - that's all through life with what they
76:23 - got and that's great that's so
76:24 - completely okay
76:25 - now yeah did it make you happy like did
76:28 - it were you like content with like
76:30 - with like the opportunity and what would
76:32 - you what were we doing at
76:34 - at the point in miami um
76:37 - i mean i think that there was a major
76:40 - piece missing
76:41 - and that was like the uh relationships
76:43 - and friendships
76:44 - i got to a point where you know i was
76:46 - just like man i'd rather
76:48 - say screw all this i would rather have
76:50 - the relationships and friendships
76:52 - um that are possible
76:55 - you know as i'll say in oklahoma um and
76:57 - the money and stuff
76:58 - wasn't really worth it and because you
77:01 - realize it doesn't really do anything
77:02 - for you right
77:03 - like you you get a nice car
77:07 - um or you get a nice house boat or
77:09 - whatever you want a nice clothes
77:11 - and you may get some compliments but
77:13 - what is that doing for you right it's
77:14 - not really
77:15 - doesn't make you a better person doesn't
77:16 - make you feel any better um
77:18 - it's just very short short-lived
77:20 - gratification so
77:22 - i just really realized that um my focus
77:25 - was too much on money
77:26 - because if i know you followed me for a
77:28 - very long time and
77:30 - uh you may have seen a shift in some of
77:32 - my content because very early on it was
77:34 - every post was money related like yeah
77:36 - how to make more money how to grow
77:38 - agency how to up your hourly rates like
77:39 - it
77:40 - all it was all money related and now i
77:43 - don't really even think
77:45 - about about the money aspect like i
77:46 - don't before i would set
77:48 - i want to hit this amount of revenue
77:49 - every month or hit this amount every
77:51 - year
77:51 - i don't really think about that anymore
77:53 - i just think you know do i actually
77:55 - enjoy what i'm doing
77:56 - um is it fulfilling me is it something
77:59 - that i enjoy am i stressed out all the
78:01 - time
78:02 - is the stress worth you know my purpose
78:04 - is my purpose actually being served here
78:06 - um i think those are the important
78:08 - questions to ask
78:09 - i think everybody has to figure out for
78:12 - themselves
78:13 - whether freelancing and the added
78:15 - baggage that comes with it is really
78:17 - worth it for them
78:18 - so then so then do you think that
78:19 - selling money is the goal do you think
78:21 - it's bad do you think it's
78:23 - bad to have you know a revenue goal like
78:24 - hey i want to make 100k this year
78:26 - or 150k this year right and whatever it
78:29 - takes i'll just get there
78:30 - do you think that that's that's a bad
78:32 - way of doing it
78:33 - i don't think it's bad um i think
78:35 - everybody should do that at first like
78:37 - that was
78:37 - when i had my course that was one of the
78:39 - first things i asked people is how much
78:40 - money do you want to make
78:41 - because you know when you're starting
78:43 - out you you want to make a change in
78:45 - your life for the most part i mean most
78:47 - people aren't going for making like 500k
78:49 - a year
78:49 - and saying okay i want to switch my
78:51 - career to learn how to code like
78:52 - nobody's doing that usually it's people
78:54 - who are like i want to start and
78:55 - start a career that's going to make me
78:56 - more so i think starting off
78:59 - like go for it monetary monetary goals
79:01 - are going to be
79:02 - important um you know especially i think
79:04 - it's once you get past 75k things don't
79:06 - really change in your life a whole
79:08 - lot the more money you get after 75 000
79:10 - a year
79:11 - your life doesn't really change a whole
79:12 - lot after that um statistically so
79:16 - i think once you get to a point of
79:18 - saying
79:19 - next year i want to make 600k i
79:22 - i personally don't see the value in that
79:24 - i look at that as like
79:27 - why even why even put that through your
79:29 - brain just like at that point just do it
79:32 - you don't need to wake up and think you
79:34 - know i want to make 600k this year like
79:36 - you should all the all the stuff that
79:38 - you've built up should help you grow
79:39 - long term from there so i think it is
79:41 - unhealthy
79:42 - once you get past a certain point to
79:44 - continue to think about money all the
79:46 - time like that
79:46 - yeah i for example personally for
79:49 - example for me
79:51 - like i don't know why why but for some
79:53 - reason like i never
79:54 - put money on the pedestal yeah i never
79:57 - in my life was like oh [ __ ] this is this
79:59 - holy grail right
80:00 - i knew i could have and i was never
80:01 - afraid to spend it
80:04 - it was never a thing i was like oh [ __ ]
80:05 - i gotta keep this in savings and then i
80:07 - gotta you know
80:08 - i gotta keep it there just to make sure
80:09 - it's all good you know stuff like that
80:11 - i don't know if it's just because of i
80:12 - was very lucky that my parents
80:14 - put that mentality into me right or
80:16 - whatever it might be
80:18 - but for me for example was like you know
80:20 - what i'm going to use this money to
80:22 - maybe
80:22 - you know put it to myself you know one
80:24 - of the coolest things that i had is
80:26 - i mean i got lucky with this yes of
80:27 - course i was given two thousand dollars
80:29 - for example from my parents
80:30 - to uh you know when i was i think it was
80:33 - like 18 years old
80:34 - to put into stock markets they saw that
80:36 - i was doing the stock market i just
80:37 - haven't
80:38 - earned money just yet i was earning some
80:40 - little money of course
80:41 - but nothing crazy and crazy enough like
80:44 - how
80:44 - the kids like i spent like i lost a dog
80:47 - like
80:47 - literally i lost it all with on with it
80:49 - within [ __ ] weeks
80:52 - because i put into a penny stock that
80:53 - [ __ ] went down it went bankrupt
80:55 - [Laughter]
80:59 - but granted i also learned a [ __ ] time
81:02 - from that
81:03 - oh i learned a lot like
81:06 - from there what happened is then i just
81:08 - shifted my
81:09 - strategy to do long term to a point
81:11 - where now
81:12 - in my robinhood account and other
81:15 - accounts
81:15 - you're looking at around 140 150k and so
81:19 - forth
81:20 - yeah yeah well and the important thing
81:23 - as well
81:23 - is like you said not not necessarily
81:26 - putting it on a pedestal
81:28 - unless your goals revolve around like
81:30 - your goals revolve around that partially
81:32 - right so
81:33 - let's say you you um you're trying to
81:36 - buy a new house for your family
81:38 - yeah or you want to retire one of your
81:40 - family members
81:41 - you obviously have to have big financial
81:43 - goals to do that of course yes um
81:45 - and i i i think this is more discussion
81:47 - of what's healthy and what's unhealthy
81:48 - in terms of
81:49 - uh you know financial goals but i think
81:52 - it's extremely healthy
81:54 - if you if you're doing it with a purpose
81:56 - if you're just saying i want to make
81:57 - 600k just have 600k and blow it next
82:00 - year
82:00 - or 100k or 200k then it's like dude
82:03 - what's the point
82:04 - there's no purpose now like if you're
82:05 - living your life every day for that
82:07 - there's absolutely no purpose in your
82:09 - life like you need to figure out what
82:10 - actually matters
82:11 - so yeah that's awesome that's amazing so
82:14 - so so look blake so at this point right
82:16 - you you've got this you've got this
82:17 - company you've got the software agency
82:19 - now right you're you're a mozzie
82:21 - and i'm very curious i want to ask you
82:23 - like what happened where you decided
82:25 - like to go from
82:26 - you know completely switch to go from
82:28 - from miami to now back to tulsa
82:31 - what kind of happened that time frame
82:34 - um so at the end of my second year i had
82:37 - already um
82:39 - you know just just told myself yeah i'm
82:40 - gonna move i had i liked atlanta georgia
82:42 - a lot
82:43 - um i went there a couple times and met
82:45 - some really cool people
82:47 - i just knew miami wasn't really a good
82:49 - fit for me so
82:50 - i knew i was going to move somewhere uh
82:52 - at the end at the end of my lease which
82:54 - was
82:54 - february of uh last year so
82:57 - um atlanta was on the top of the list i
82:59 - actually ended up
83:00 - applying for a um for a house there just
83:04 - for like a
83:05 - like a lease a rental house and um
83:08 - didn't get approved for some reason they
83:09 - said my
83:11 - my business had to be in georgia because
83:13 - it was like
83:14 - somewhere deal where my income was
83:16 - florida and not georgia so they want to
83:17 - let me lease the house
83:18 - and she was like okay i don't have time
83:20 - to mess with this and i found a house
83:22 - back here in oklahoma
83:23 - and at the time i was actually in a
83:24 - relationship with somebody who was
83:26 - living in oklahoma as well um so it just
83:29 - made more sense
83:30 - um it was in that relationship oklahoma
83:33 - was good for me um
83:34 - i i wanted to be around some of the the
83:36 - business people that i had met here
83:37 - you know several years ago and also kind
83:39 - of collaborate with them on some stuff
83:40 - so
83:41 - it was just a natural fit to move back
83:43 - and now how does it feel now like how
83:44 - does it feel now in terms of what you're
83:46 - doing now and
83:47 - and uh you know being there around your
83:50 - friends and family
83:51 - i i think it's like the the perfect
83:54 - balance like i got i got what i needed
83:56 - from miami
83:57 - and i still get what i need from
83:58 - oklahoma um so
84:02 - pretty much majority of the time like i
84:03 - i feel good like i feel like
84:05 - i can work and be very productive and
84:08 - get everything done
84:09 - and grow my business in my career while
84:12 - also
84:13 - still having relationships like probably
84:15 - once a week
84:16 - this is how i think how big of an effect
84:18 - miami had on me
84:19 - like once a week um at least
84:22 - uh i'll walk in the gym or i'll go into
84:25 - a place to get a smoothie or i'll go eat
84:27 - food somewhere and you know i see
84:30 - somebody i know or i talk to a random
84:32 - person and have a really good
84:33 - conversation with them
84:34 - and you know i walk in i'm like this is
84:37 - what this is the piece i was missing the
84:38 - whole time was like
84:40 - having these people around me like a lot
84:42 - of people will tell you you got to move
84:43 - away from your hometown
84:45 - i i think yeah it's great go out and
84:47 - experience it but
84:48 - there's nothing wrong with moving back
84:50 - like when i moved back i was like
84:51 - everybody's gonna think i'm a failure
84:53 - like they're gonna think this kid moved
84:54 - out to miami and he came back because he
84:56 - couldn't afford it and he's a failure
84:59 - and then i i started thinking like no
85:01 - that's not it doesn't matter this
85:02 - this is me i know myself right started
85:05 - coming back and realized man i'm much
85:06 - happier
85:07 - being in this environment yeah than i
85:09 - thought i would be so it's really good
85:11 - yeah it's you know there's nothing wrong
85:13 - with definitely moving out so
85:14 - to try something right i was i mean for
85:17 - me it's like i moved out too late to try
85:18 - something out right
85:20 - and honestly i'm very happy with it for
85:21 - me personally for example i just like
85:23 - i moved out i finally feel like you look
85:25 - a little more independent
85:26 - now right right and has completely
85:29 - changed
85:30 - me my income and everything right yeah
85:34 - and and i'm very happy but my goal is at
85:36 - this at the end of the day is still to
85:38 - bring in
85:38 - like i want to bring a family to l.a you
85:40 - know like i brought them to like they
85:42 - came to l.a you know
85:43 - they came to a week ago and i'm like i'm
85:46 - showing them all this cool stuff with
85:47 - the secret plan of like trying to get it
85:48 - to move in here you know i'm like hey
85:50 - guys
85:50 - [Laughter]
85:53 - so yeah so that that's kind of that and
85:55 - so now so now blake so now
85:59 - now what does the future look like for
86:00 - you now like
86:02 - um yeah i actually had somebody ask me
86:04 - that question like two days ago
86:05 - like what is what's what's what are the
86:07 - goals what are the future
86:09 - really by 25 i like to be at the point
86:12 - where i'm pretty much done
86:14 - so not really involved in the day-to-day
86:17 - agency work still have the agency
86:19 - but really be more focused on just
86:21 - long-term investments and just managing
86:23 - those
86:23 - because that's like step one was
86:27 - programming working that step two is
86:29 - agency
86:30 - being involved in architecture step
86:32 - three is like a much higher level view
86:34 - of everything
86:35 - so you know getting somebody to manage
86:37 - the business
86:38 - and managing them and managing different
86:41 - investments or potentially getting into
86:43 - real estate
86:43 - um just being more involved with
86:46 - figuring out how to
86:48 - it'll make the money work for me and
86:51 - that's
86:52 - three years is really the goal i've set
86:54 - to be at the point where i have enough
86:55 - money to be able to figure out how i can
86:56 - make
86:57 - make it make enough for me to where it
87:00 - makes what i'm making now basically so
87:02 - by itself basically
87:04 - it's exactly so are you look looking at
87:06 - it as more like uh what's it called
87:07 - what is it called the income the the
87:10 - automatically recurring income what is
87:11 - it what's the name of the the income
87:12 - cost passive income passive income
87:14 - is that which more so you're looking for
87:16 - um
87:18 - not i mean not necessarily passive like
87:20 - i don't i don't see
87:21 - myself ever getting to the point where
87:22 - i'm like a hundred percent passive
87:24 - you believe do you believe in passive
87:26 - income uh
87:28 - not really i mean i don't think it's
87:29 - necessarily possible just because
87:31 - i mean one unless it's like stocks or
87:34 - something i guess that's technically
87:36 - potentially completely passive if you
87:37 - want it to be yeah um
87:39 - but when it comes to things like an
87:41 - agency there's no way that could be
87:42 - passive yeah i don't think
87:43 - i mean you're shooting far
87:49 - so the way i mean the way i look at it
87:50 - too is like i'm i'm never going to stop
87:52 - working on things like i in in three
87:55 - years i imagine
87:56 - i i want to be the point where my money
87:58 - can make
87:59 - you know what i'm making now without
88:00 - doing a whole lot of yeah you know grunt
88:02 - work for it but
88:03 - you know i still love doing this stuff i
88:05 - don't hate what i do by any means like
88:07 - yeah
88:07 - i could i just want to get to the point
88:09 - where i'm 25 i can say
88:11 - i can be done now if i want to actually
88:14 - be done yeah
88:15 - really holy [ __ ] that's crazy because
88:18 - i'm 25 i'm like holy [ __ ]
88:20 - you know 22 i mean look
88:24 - i'm very happy for for people's success
88:26 - right
88:27 - yeah like for me that is amazing that
88:30 - inspires me it inspires so many
88:32 - other people as well like to be able to
88:34 - see someone who started so
88:36 - young 18 even younger than that you know
88:39 - to
88:39 - build up this agency build up this
88:41 - company to now have this
88:42 - and so forth it is it is pretty insane
88:45 - and it's not
88:46 - an easy job at all right
88:49 - and and now like what you you say what i
88:51 - think remind me of
88:53 - seven employees you said or something
88:54 - right seven or six eight eight eight
88:56 - employees
88:57 - right and are you guys over mold now at
88:59 - this point you guys are all remote
89:00 - workingly or
89:00 - you have an office um one guy is
89:03 - actually
89:04 - like 10 miles down the road for me but
89:06 - nice he's
89:07 - we technically work remote that's
89:08 - awesome that's awesome so
89:10 - so that's amazing so blake you guys have
89:13 - heard that basically right of his story
89:14 - kind of like
89:15 - what he is he's been through and where
89:19 - he has gone
89:19 - i want to now take a few questions kind
89:21 - of like from the audience and
89:23 - in terms of what they've asked you know
89:25 - and just
89:26 - just kind of go to them is that okay
89:29 - sweet
89:29 - so one person example asked is like so
89:33 - tell me a way to start like how did you
89:35 - start like what would you tell someone
89:37 - who's a beginner
89:38 - like who wants to potentially start
89:40 - freelancing right
89:41 - how will we how would you go ahead and
89:43 - tell them hey you know what maybe it's
89:44 - star freelance if let's start there
89:45 - what would you say yeah so i just
89:48 - something i taught a long time ago
89:50 - um is i i think that
89:54 - there's two stages freelancing one is
89:57 - um you know meg is using a website
90:00 - called freelancer.com i haven't used it
90:02 - in years
90:02 - um so i don't know if i can necessarily
90:04 - vouch for it anymore but
90:06 - the reasoning is freelancer.com is gonna
90:09 - or similar sites that are smaller like
90:11 - that will be able to provide you with
90:13 - smaller gigs that don't have a massive
90:15 - effect on your reputation
90:17 - right so if you do one you don't do so
90:19 - well on it
90:20 - it's not really going to matter that
90:22 - much long term you do want to be careful
90:24 - with it make sure you do the project as
90:25 - good as you can but
90:27 - not going to have a huge reputational
90:28 - impact long term besides like upwork
90:31 - sorry you have something should you
90:32 - start should you start with small
90:33 - projects you start with some small gigs
90:36 - yes definitely small gigs i think don't
90:38 - jump into big stuff
90:39 - yeah um the second piece of that is
90:42 - upwork
90:43 - upwork is like holy grail of freelancing
90:46 - um and a couple pieces of this so
90:50 - upwork um depending on what country you
90:53 - live in
90:54 - uh i assume there's people from other
90:56 - countries out in the u.s is that right
91:00 - i think it's all u.s okay okay again
91:02 - this is not a problem
91:03 - so yeah um other countries typically
91:05 - have a hard time getting approved to get
91:07 - into upwork so that's the only thing i
91:08 - want to mention there yeah
91:09 - um but uh up work you can make a lot of
91:12 - money off of i mean we've done
91:14 - i think somewhere over 500k through
91:17 - upwork and we're top 10 agencies on
91:19 - upwork
91:20 - that's insane so you can do a lot there
91:23 - the reason i say do something smaller
91:24 - like freelancer.com
91:26 - uh if you screw up your reputation on
91:28 - upwork you're screwed forever
91:30 - so just be very careful wait a year or
91:32 - so before you get into that because
91:34 - you can really set yourself up with a
91:35 - good career on upwork if you if you do
91:37 - it right
91:37 - how do you build up your how do you
91:39 - build up your petition there
91:41 - on upwork yes uh so biggest thing
91:44 - and this applies to freelancer.com as
91:46 - well um when you're going to get gigs
91:49 - people people often would ask me
91:51 - questions like hey i've put five
91:52 - proposals in this week
91:53 - why haven't i gotten anything to give
91:55 - you guys the understanding how much we
91:56 - do we do at least 100 proposals every
91:58 - single week and we still do that now
92:00 - um so the volume is there and we may
92:02 - close let's say two deals a month
92:04 - off of four or 500 proposals holy [ __ ]
92:08 - yeah but think about it you know we
92:10 - closed one deal
92:12 - say it's 40 50k you know i paid somebody
92:15 - you know an hour a day to do this it's
92:18 - totally worth it
92:19 - um so volume is super important there
92:22 - um that's always tough for freelancers
92:24 - initially it's just making sure you get
92:25 - that volume
92:26 - do you are your clients right now are
92:28 - they all still like
92:29 - uh recurring clients or is this you
92:31 - always have to get new clients
92:33 - um we have both so we have one for
92:35 - example that's been with us for two
92:36 - years they've had somebody developer
92:37 - full-time for two years
92:40 - we have some others that are you know
92:41 - one and done we do a three six month
92:43 - contract they're done
92:45 - so um we just try to keep it rolling
92:48 - okay
92:48 - okay awesome sweet sweet sweet and what
92:51 - we what would you sell like
92:52 - what should they expect like what should
92:54 - someone who goes into this
92:55 - right what should they expect going into
92:58 - like a freelancing
92:59 - type of world um
93:03 - what should i expect that's a good
93:04 - question i mean i think the first thing
93:06 - is they're
93:06 - they're not going to know everything
93:08 - right you expect to not know everything
93:10 - when you go into it
93:12 - and try to understand the concept of
93:15 - something what i try to think of when i
93:17 - uh when i go into any new project is
93:20 - you know my job is to help take
93:22 - something from a concept
93:24 - to an actual product and that's your job
93:26 - at the end of the day as well because
93:27 - most of these people contact you who are
93:29 - probably
93:29 - not going to have a whole lot of
93:30 - technical experience so this is where
93:32 - your skills have to come in and your
93:34 - confidence has to come in that you can
93:36 - say okay i realized your problem
93:38 - and i'm going to figure out a solution
93:39 - for it as you build it up you'll be able
93:42 - to say i realize your problem
93:43 - i have a solution for it that's what i
93:45 - did today i was on a call with somebody
93:47 - we had built something six months ago
93:48 - this person needed the exact same thing
93:50 - i was able to say i already built this
93:52 - like 100 have a solution for your
93:54 - problem my biggest thing when you're
93:56 - starting out is just making sure
93:57 - you show that confidence that you're
93:58 - willing to figure out the solution
94:01 - and as you go into it that you're gonna
94:03 - have to spend probably a lot more time
94:05 - than what you're getting paid like if
94:07 - you're getting paid 500 bucks for a job
94:09 - you probably could have gone and worked
94:10 - a work minimum wage job and made more by
94:12 - the time you completed it but that's not
94:13 - the point
94:14 - point is you gain the knowledge from it
94:16 - and that makes you even more valuable
94:17 - for the next deal and the next deal the
94:19 - next deal
94:20 - how do you go ahead for example when you
94:22 - approach clients right
94:24 - in what format you usually you know
94:27 - more formally do you talk to them right
94:29 - to show them confidence to
94:31 - you know to close a deal what does it
94:33 - mean for you to what do you do to close
94:35 - the deal i guess in my question
94:38 - and the biggest thing is just going to
94:38 - be having confidence in your voice so
94:41 - you know when you talk talking like you
94:43 - know what you're talking you're talking
94:44 - about yeah when i started there was
94:45 - plenty of times where
94:47 - i was talking about things that i didn't
94:48 - know what i was talking about
94:50 - in my head i knew i could figure it out
94:51 - but i made sure that
94:53 - my voice my tone you know the way that i
94:55 - was if it was a video call the way that
94:56 - i was sitting
94:57 - the way i was dressed you know
95:00 - presentation is everything that's what i
95:01 - used to teach a lot and my very old
95:03 - course was that
95:04 - presentation is super important like the
95:06 - small details that people don't focus on
95:08 - like when we
95:09 - when we start with a new deal run you
95:10 - through the whole process
95:13 - so we start with a new client proposal
95:15 - goes in they instantly get a link
95:17 - to schedule a meeting with us uh so they
95:19 - get my whole calendar they can schedule
95:20 - a meeting with us right away
95:22 - they don't have to message me you don't
95:23 - have to talk to me or anything they
95:24 - schedule it
95:25 - um right after that schedules we have an
95:27 - automated email that goes out and says
95:29 - hey
95:29 - you know if you guys can send us any
95:30 - more details please do so just so we can
95:32 - be prepared for the call that's awesome
95:34 - that's the second piece of it
95:35 - third we get on a call video chat we
95:37 - have everybody on our team will have
95:39 - these shirts on
95:40 - no way clean backgrounds everybody's got
95:42 - them and we've got like
95:44 - 40 boxes in my closet full of like packs
95:46 - um
95:47 - oh back to give me one second oh
95:49 - background really this is this is gonna
95:51 - be uh
95:52 - show me show you guys something
95:55 - i'll pull one of these out here
96:02 - yeah so this is basically what my closet
96:04 - is filled with these are our boxes
96:06 - with our logos on it wow all of our
96:08 - website branding as well
96:10 - wow so you'll notice if you look at this
96:13 - and go to our website
96:15 - the lines are key elements of our
96:17 - websites
96:18 - colors are the same everything's the
96:20 - same so when we start working with a
96:22 - client as soon as we get them to sign an
96:25 - nda
96:26 - we send them a welcome card wow no way
96:30 - we send them a custom mozzie t-shirt
96:34 - show show the t-shirt show me the
96:36 - t-shirt i'm very curious
96:38 - it looks really cool yeah so a lot of we
96:40 - got these in really soft
96:42 - versions a lot of like people like
96:43 - wearing these at the gym a couple people
96:44 - in my gym wear them
96:45 - uh-huh big mozzie logo yeah look at that
96:48 - that looks amazing
96:51 - we got mozzie mugs
96:54 - oh [ __ ] we got some nice pins i
96:57 - love it so this is just something small
96:59 - like once we get an nda sign and we get
97:01 - their address
97:02 - we'll send it to them they won't even
97:03 - know it's coming and
97:05 - it shows up i mean this is we closed
97:08 - like a 40k deal off of justice alone
97:10 - last year
97:11 - wow but that you know that that just
97:13 - shows the professionality and
97:15 - the care right if you get something like
97:17 - this from
97:18 - a company right like
97:21 - like they're not here to joke around
97:24 - yeah they're not here to they're not
97:25 - here to
97:25 - to [ __ ] around that's that's what that's
97:27 - that's what it says right
97:29 - yeah and there's there's like so many of
97:31 - those little things that
97:32 - holidays will send those boxes out but
97:34 - they'll be holiday themed
97:36 - no and it's like there'll be totally
97:38 - totally different things in there
97:39 - and so the thing is just trying to
97:41 - figure out even now
97:43 - companies our size typically aren't
97:45 - doing that stuff but
97:47 - you know one of the things that my uh my
97:48 - coach and i have talked about
97:50 - all last year was how can we make
97:52 - ourselves look like these massive
97:54 - companies
97:55 - but still keep our demographic right
97:57 - because the companies above us are
97:58 - charging 200 an hour
98:00 - we're charging 90 to 100 an hour um
98:03 - so in my head i've always been like how
98:04 - can i be playing on the same field as
98:06 - these big guys
98:08 - while also kind of staying at um our
98:11 - demographic because i'm very happy with
98:12 - where we're at
98:13 - and so that's when we started pulling
98:14 - these little elements like just making
98:16 - sure we look more professional when we
98:18 - get on video calls
98:19 - perfecting emails perfecting those boxes
98:22 - website stuff um just so many aspects
98:25 - like if you really focus on every piece
98:28 - of getting a client and you perfect it
98:31 - yeah it'll be so much easier
98:32 - because then little touches because then
98:34 - you you repeat that process over and
98:36 - over and over again
98:37 - and of course i'm guessing you know the
98:38 - whole process of like when you
98:39 - communicate
98:40 - right while you're building a project
98:42 - like i'm very curious
98:43 - how does that look like for you like
98:45 - what do you guys do you know every
98:46 - single two weeks you send out some
98:48 - you know you send out like you know uh
98:50 - information about here's the state of
98:52 - your project how does it look like for
98:53 - you i'm curious
98:54 - that so that's one thing that you kind
98:56 - of need to gauge with who you're working
98:57 - with
98:58 - and figure out why are they hiring you
99:00 - are they hiring you to be a supplement
99:02 - to you know their existing team um are
99:05 - they hiring you to
99:07 - just give you a problem and have you
99:08 - find a solution like that needs to be
99:09 - something you ask
99:10 - or figure out maybe not even ask but you
99:12 - figure out how to infer from your first
99:14 - conversations
99:15 - um let's figure out what they actually
99:16 - need because we have some clients that
99:18 - they don't want to talk to us at all
99:20 - like until we have something ready for
99:21 - us they don't want to talk to us like
99:22 - just get it ready and then deliver it
99:24 - then we have other clients that every
99:26 - every two three days
99:27 - they like to have a call and if people
99:29 - are paying us enough
99:31 - we'll do a call every two or three days
99:33 - um but if
99:34 - people are you know not paying that much
99:36 - like let's say they're paying for 10
99:37 - hour
99:38 - like 20 hours a week part-time resource
99:40 - we're not gonna have three meetings with
99:41 - you a week it doesn't make sense yeah do
99:42 - it once a week around every two weeks
99:44 - um but you just kind of have to gauge
99:47 - that's part of your
99:47 - um you know kind of your vetting process
99:49 - at the front too i've had clients that i
99:51 - can tell
99:52 - they're gonna be on my ass about
99:53 - everything and i just don't take them
99:54 - because it's like
99:55 - i don't need i don't need that um i want
99:57 - people they're going to be like
99:59 - hey here's the problem they'll trust
100:00 - that i'm going to solve it and give me
100:02 - time to do it
100:04 - it's good in a day if you're it's good
100:06 - to be in that position and you're like
100:07 - you know what i don't need you
100:09 - yeah and that confuses people the most
100:11 - honestly like
100:12 - that's that's such a power play that
100:14 - confuses the heck out of so many people
100:15 - when you're like
100:16 - i don't like if you're not gonna follow
100:18 - doing it my way we're just not gonna do
100:20 - this at all because you came to me like
100:21 - i didn't
100:22 - come to you yeah right and so yeah
100:25 - when you're at that point that's that's
100:26 - actually how you close you can close
100:28 - even more deals is because people get
100:29 - confused and they're like oh this guy
100:30 - really knows what he's doing because
100:32 - he's going to say
100:33 - fu to me basically yeah that actually
100:35 - has happened to us as well as well we're
100:37 - like yeah
100:37 - if you take out the deal off the table
100:40 - interesting things that start to happen
100:42 - they do
100:45 - that's interesting so now let me ask you
100:47 - this like
100:48 - i know this is like uh kind of like at
100:50 - this point like
100:52 - how do you build up your environment in
100:53 - your company
100:56 - um like what do you think what do you
100:58 - worry about right or like or what's
100:59 - important to you
101:00 - in terms of environment well first you
101:03 - got to figure
101:04 - out you know people working for you what
101:05 - are their goals right and
101:07 - what are your goals and how well do
101:08 - those match so when you hire somebody
101:10 - um you know i'm not interested in hiring
101:13 - people that are
101:15 - late in their career and that don't have
101:17 - a whole lot of ambition
101:18 - you know my my whole thing is if we take
101:20 - on a client like
101:22 - i'm most the time i'm going to set a
101:24 - pretty realistic timeline and
101:25 - expectations and i'm going to have a
101:27 - high expectation of quality
101:29 - good example of this is last year we
101:31 - hired somebody he was a developer from
101:32 - microsoft
101:33 - 20 years with them um seemed like a
101:35 - really experienced guy
101:37 - and he couldn't keep up with the pace
101:39 - that we were working at
101:40 - and he was like well i i lo i had a
101:43 - lower rate because i wanted something
101:45 - more relaxed
101:46 - and what i just i just said that's not
101:47 - what we're interested in right
101:49 - so we're totally understanding that but
101:50 - that's not we're interested in so when
101:52 - you hire people you need to think about
101:54 - where they are in their life do you does
101:56 - your company
101:57 - and and your you know attitude towards
101:59 - things fit with their life as well
102:01 - because if it doesn't you're both going
102:02 - to be unhappy um i think a big thing is
102:05 - just making sure
102:06 - you and your employees mesh in terms of
102:08 - your your life goals like
102:09 - a lot of people work for us or young
102:12 - some of them have families that are very
102:13 - young families as well so they want to
102:15 - do big things for their family
102:17 - um they have a lot of ambition a lot of
102:19 - motivation so i think that's a big piece
102:20 - of it is just
102:21 - understanding your people um that's
102:23 - awesome and
102:24 - and also not being afraid to uh you know
102:27 - keep personal life
102:28 - out of things right i have a huge
102:30 - passion for cars uh pretty much
102:32 - everybody on my team knows that
102:33 - if somebody needs a new car usually they
102:34 - come and ask me hey what car should i
102:36 - get
102:37 - uh really and you're like get yourself
102:39 - an audi r8
102:40 - get this one yeah but you know a lot of
102:43 - them have car passions too
102:45 - um so it just you know you gotta you
102:47 - gotta find what works well for your
102:49 - for your goals your team and uh get the
102:52 - right people in the door
102:52 - so that's amazing that's amazing yeah i
102:54 - think like honestly hiring is probably
102:57 - one of the hardest things you can do
102:59 - um in a company because we're doing it
103:01 - we're doing a lot of hiring as well here
103:03 - here at clever program right it's one of
103:04 - the hardest things to do
103:06 - but it's probably one of the most
103:07 - important things to do yeah
103:09 - right because your people like the whole
103:10 - company yeah people you don't have a
103:12 - good product
103:13 - exactly the people are the company right
103:16 - exactly yeah and it's like you're
103:17 - bringing one person or two people that
103:19 - they're like it's a game changer now
103:22 - yeah so let me ask you this like how do
103:25 - you find those people because i've had
103:26 - for someone one
103:27 - of the questions that was on there is
103:28 - like you know how did you go about
103:30 - finding people for your team
103:31 - like how do you still go about finding
103:33 - people for your team
103:35 - yeah so when i first started it was
103:36 - literally i'd go on upwork
103:38 - i'd get the deal on upwork i'd go find
103:39 - somebody on upwork and
103:42 - do it that way so it started to be
103:44 - coming to the point where
103:45 - a lot of the upward qual uh quality
103:47 - developers just wasn't very good in my
103:48 - opinion
103:49 - um so i started doing other things like
103:52 - referrals
103:52 - of developers that were already working
103:54 - for me they would refer one of their
103:55 - friends that would work for me
103:56 - um clients that we worked for
104:00 - let's say one of their developers quit
104:01 - you know six months down the road we had
104:03 - one guy that i worked with three years
104:04 - ago and he came
104:06 - back and asked me what i was doing and
104:07 - we hired him wow um
104:10 - so indeed um linkedin it's just the
104:13 - biggest thing is
104:14 - you've got to do a ton of interviews to
104:15 - find good people a lot of time
104:17 - what do you look for and i'm very
104:19 - curious because like the specific things
104:20 - that like for example we look for as
104:22 - well
104:22 - like what do you look for in in people
104:25 - when you hire them i know you said
104:27 - you know hunger things like that what
104:29 - what are some other things
104:31 - um so depending on what technology i'm
104:33 - hiring for uh let's say
104:34 - dot net sharp.net i would ask some
104:36 - questions specifically around that
104:38 - that may be fairly simple not really
104:41 - anything you have to think through hard
104:42 - about
104:42 - but i i listen to see how they explain
104:44 - it um
104:46 - do they explain it in a way that that
104:48 - shows that they have a lot of deep
104:50 - knowledge about the subject or is it
104:51 - very
104:52 - surface level where they they could
104:54 - probably integrate it but they don't
104:55 - really know what it's doing
104:56 - um just asking different kind of
104:58 - questions technical questions to figure
105:00 - out what is somebody's
105:01 - skill level yeah technology for example
105:04 - or
105:04 - uh asking questions like hey if i
105:06 - present this problem to you how would
105:07 - you go about solving it
105:09 - um how would you uh how would you
105:12 - coordinate this with a
105:14 - let's say a front-end designer if you're
105:15 - a back-end a back-end developer
105:17 - like just understanding more how they
105:18 - think um instead of like trying to give
105:21 - them a code test or something in that
105:22 - like that i don't believe in those i
105:23 - would rather just
105:24 - figure out how does somebody think um
105:27 - how quickly can they answer things well
105:29 - when you do a technical interview right
105:31 - are you do you still ask them any
105:32 - technical questions so do you just have
105:34 - them explain
105:34 - explain like a project um typically
105:37 - explain projects or explain
105:39 - uh how they took something from concept
105:41 - to an actual product but you know i'm
105:44 - not i'm not asking things like
105:46 - uh you know how does dependency
105:47 - injection work and net i don't
105:49 - because you know i can get enough from
105:52 - um those questions about projects or
105:55 - other things and
105:56 - the other day what you're gonna realize
105:57 - too is people are an investment
105:59 - some are really good and some are really
106:00 - bad um
106:02 - so a lot of the times you can only do so
106:05 - much in an interview
106:06 - and then you just have to hire the
106:07 - person and find out what happens
106:09 - um so you just have to be ready for that
106:11 - sound decisions you gotta test it out
106:12 - basically what you're saying
106:14 - yeah that's interesting yeah i mean
106:16 - because like the reason why i asked this
106:17 - question is well because
106:18 - you know a lot of people they're looking
106:20 - for jobs and you know a lot of jobs when
106:22 - they when they go ahead and
106:24 - they when they interview right there's a
106:26 - lot of things that you know they ask
106:28 - some some people some good jobs
106:29 - ask just kind of what you're saying
106:31 - right they ask you to explain a project
106:34 - some jobs do technical interviews right
106:36 - now
106:37 - granted i'm still very um
106:41 - very kind of like uh i look out for
106:44 - things on the tactical aspect as well
106:46 - like for example because what i see a
106:47 - lot a lot of times is i'm not sure if
106:49 - you've seen this before
106:50 - in your hand as well is there there'll
106:52 - be people who like for example who come
106:53 - from like
106:54 - maybe you know universities or you know
106:56 - other other
106:57 - institutions and you know they've got
107:00 - all these crazy projects on hand and
107:02 - they can do all this stuff
107:03 - but for some reason when it comes to
107:04 - like being able to create some stuff on
107:06 - their own
107:07 - or understand the technical aspects yeah
107:09 - or even do something even the simplest
107:11 - of problems
107:13 - they have the hardest times yeah it
107:15 - takes forever yeah i don't know that's
107:17 - that's
107:17 - that's have you seen that thing yeah no
107:20 - totally i mean there's people who are
107:22 - who are insanely smart from uh from the
107:25 - way
107:25 - computer science is taught on a uh
107:28 - education or college level
107:30 - but when it comes to implementation it's
107:32 - like what's going on here
107:34 - like where's where's what's why is why
107:37 - is it so difficult
107:38 - um and that's when i think it's you have
107:41 - to understand there's different types of
107:42 - developers right so
107:43 - with our u's case it's more effective
107:45 - for me to interview the way i do
107:46 - because it's shown to provide me the
107:48 - people i want when i ask those questions
107:50 - and get those kind of
107:51 - responses now when you talk about
107:53 - somebody like google
107:54 - they're going to have really strict you
107:56 - know code
107:59 - reviews where it's they're not asking
108:01 - they may ask questions like i do but
108:02 - it's not going to make their decision
108:04 - it's because those developers are people
108:06 - who
108:06 - they want they want that developer to
108:08 - sit in a room all day every day and
108:09 - focus on such a tiny piece of the
108:11 - program
108:11 - all day every day that it's good for
108:14 - those people who are coming out of
108:15 - college
108:15 - so what i realized is there's just
108:17 - there's different fits
108:19 - those people that are coming out of
108:20 - college that are like that are really
108:22 - good
108:22 - but not for an agency approach in my
108:24 - opinion most
108:26 - interesting interesting and so okay so
108:28 - for example now when you for example
108:29 - hire right
108:30 - uh how much do you have i'm curious like
108:31 - do you look higher every single do you
108:33 - look for hires every single what every
108:35 - week
108:35 - right because like from what we read
108:37 - from where we're learning from others is
108:39 - like
108:39 - hiring should be like one the one the
108:41 - number one things you should be doing
108:42 - every single time
108:43 - correct me i mean i don't i don't see it
108:46 - like that personally
108:47 - um i think if you're a big enough
108:48 - company yeah for sure like that should
108:50 - be
108:50 - a huge priority for us um
108:53 - we've got eight people there's there's
108:54 - not a whole lot of like
108:57 - it's not we'd be we probably do that for
108:58 - about two weeks and we have a full team
109:00 - if we if we knocked everybody off
109:02 - um but it's one of those things as kind
109:05 - of an as needed basis
109:06 - you know if we start seeing that we have
109:08 - a couple of contracts coming up
109:10 - um you know we'll start onboarding
109:12 - people or like for example all
109:13 - the telehealth stuff we've done we hired
109:15 - three new people
109:16 - um past couple months and started
109:19 - onboarding them on some of the
109:21 - procedures like technical aspect of that
109:23 - but it's really more on as needed basis
109:24 - for us it's
109:25 - smaller but that's pretty amazing like
109:27 - with eight people you've done some
109:28 - pretty amazing things like with eight
109:30 - people
109:30 - it doesn't take a lot that's the thing
109:32 - at first i was like i want to have i
109:34 - remember telling my mom
109:35 - uh years ago that i want to have
109:37 - hundreds of developers
109:38 - and then you realize what it takes to
109:40 - manage eight then you're
109:42 - like yeah no way i want a hundred
109:45 - and it's like i can do everything i need
109:47 - with you give me a team of eight people
109:49 - we'll get everything done and
109:50 - even if it's you know i think the the
109:52 - peak we've hit was like 14
109:54 - and um
109:57 - i realized like i could be just as
109:59 - effective with eight and it's not about
110:00 - the numbers just how effective you are
110:02 - really
110:03 - that's awesome that's amazing so so look
110:06 - so
110:06 - so that your story your story is very
110:09 - inspiring and
110:10 - and of course you know um everything to
110:13 - get started with
110:16 - i have one question here that's like for
110:18 - example like that somebody asked is
110:21 - what drives you right now
110:25 - it's a good question i think it's um
110:28 - you know continuing the pursuit of
110:31 - finding my passion
110:32 - you know it's it's i remember a year ago
110:36 - i would walk out and i would see my car
110:38 - and that drove me
110:39 - um that was something that was like i
110:42 - want
110:43 - you know a bigger or i want a better car
110:45 - you know it's like i want a
110:46 - lamborghini in this case i got an r8
110:50 - and it's like this it just doesn't uh i
110:53 - look at that stuff it doesn't really dry
110:54 - it doesn't dry me at all anymore
110:55 - like i could i used to go on trips and i
110:58 - would think about my car
110:59 - now i go on a trip and just like
111:01 - whatever it doesn't matter really
111:03 - i've i've thought about you know getting
111:06 - a nicer house
111:07 - like dude i got a home i got a roof over
111:08 - my head i don't care it's most important
111:10 - thing
111:11 - it just doesn't matter doesn't it
111:12 - doesn't leak water it's all it's all
111:14 - good
111:14 - yeah it's good it really is good and um
111:18 - you know right now i'm just i
111:21 - i think a big part of it is when when
111:23 - somebody like
111:24 - driving the r8 around i get pretty much
111:27 - every day somebody coming up to me
111:28 - saying
111:28 - what do you do for a living and i say i
111:31 - do addiction recovery software
111:33 - and it's like instantly this like i feel
111:36 - good about myself saying that
111:37 - and then their reaction to it as well
111:39 - and us getting to have a conversation
111:41 - about it like
111:43 - opening it up so that you know if they
111:44 - have somebody that has addiction
111:45 - problems we can talk about it like it
111:47 - just gives me so much more of a meaning
111:48 - than saying
111:49 - i run a software development agency like
111:52 - i write code
111:53 - like i i feel i feel like i am pursuing
111:57 - something that is really meaningful to
111:59 - me and that i have a passion about
112:01 - um that's that's definitely what's
112:02 - driving me right now
112:04 - do you think they'll continue to do that
112:05 - do you think over time it will change
112:08 - um i i think um
112:11 - potentially it could i think maybe the
112:14 - uh
112:16 - the scale of it will change if anything
112:18 - i mean i i after doing this for
112:20 - seven eight months it's something that i
112:22 - don't foresee myself
112:24 - ever really deviating away from now um
112:27 - i think the scale of it will grow i mean
112:29 - we've
112:30 - we've started working with uh several
112:34 - state organizations the past couple
112:35 - months
112:35 - and it's it's you know closed the whole
112:38 - state of uh
112:39 - i won't name the name but a couple
112:41 - states their whole addiction recovery
112:43 - department so
112:44 - that for me is a really really big thing
112:46 - like seeing the level of impact so i
112:48 - think that's awesome
112:49 - it will change in terms of what scale
112:51 - we're providing it on so
112:53 - yeah when you when you you're like for
112:55 - yeah honestly like
112:56 - impact on people and impact on the
112:58 - things that you care about is
112:59 - always always is just such a source of
113:02 - happiness right like
113:03 - for example for us even for example
113:05 - whenever we have a student that gets a
113:07 - job
113:07 - or whenever a student like you know he
113:09 - gets an internship even or something
113:11 - like that like holy [ __ ] like we're
113:13 - [ __ ] bouncing over our walls you know
113:15 - here
113:15 - you know we had this one guy on he got
113:18 - his first job like
113:19 - making 70k as developer right after
113:21 - doing postmates
113:23 - right and so many something about other
113:24 - other students it's
113:26 - and i remember like you know like uh he
113:29 - called us and he like started crying
113:32 - yeah and like we started crying you know
113:34 - like
113:35 - like yeah it is you know
113:38 - honestly it's [ __ ] it's [ __ ]
113:40 - amazing that that that i get to talk to
113:42 - a person that's also loved with that
113:44 - that what what he's doing right and it's
113:46 - just [ __ ] driven like
113:48 - guys [ __ ] in this world put yourself
113:51 - around people who are [ __ ] doing cool
113:52 - [ __ ]
113:53 - and [ __ ] just and make connections
113:56 - and
113:56 - and just do similar things like that's
113:59 - what's going to tell you because like
114:01 - that [ __ ] inspires the [ __ ] out of me
114:03 - yeah it's not even about like it's uh
114:05 - you know i've seen people that are
114:07 - completely different financial
114:08 - situations
114:09 - but you know are super motivating for me
114:12 - like there's
114:12 - for for example like there's this guy at
114:15 - the gym and
114:16 - yeah i've talked to him like every day
114:18 - and i'm like dude
114:20 - he's got like 60 followers on his
114:23 - instagram
114:24 - page i'm like dude you got to start
114:26 - posting more [ __ ] because like every
114:27 - time i see it it hypes me up and i'm
114:28 - like super inspired by you
114:30 - yeah right and it's like
114:33 - we're we're doing completely different
114:35 - things career-wise and i look at i'm
114:36 - like dude this [ __ ] is motivating i
114:38 - don't i don't care where you're at or
114:39 - financially or whatever part of your
114:41 - career or whatever it's like if you're
114:42 - doing something you have a passion about
114:43 - it
114:44 - that is inspiring like you putting that
114:46 - energy into something that you actually
114:47 - care about is super inspiring
114:49 - yeah yeah it always is like if you just
114:50 - put yourself out that's pretty much it i
114:52 - think that's a big thing for everybody
114:53 - out here guys
114:54 - is put yourself out there right is may
114:57 - that be on social media right
114:59 - may that be on linkedin make that be in
115:01 - anywhere
115:02 - show the best person you can show is
115:05 - you right yeah that's what people buy in
115:08 - right they don't
115:09 - people don't buy in sometimes a result
115:10 - even when you go for a job they don't
115:12 - buy into
115:13 - you know the technicals yes technical
115:15 - skills are important i agree yes 100
115:17 - but they also buy into your personality
115:20 - you come in there with amazing
115:21 - personality
115:22 - with amazing tonality and with amazing
115:25 - just like
115:26 - you know and with amazing energy that's
115:29 - what they're going to look for
115:30 - yeah that's nobody's nobody's coming to
115:33 - us and
115:34 - if if uh you know nobody's gonna come to
115:36 - our agency and say okay i'm ready to
115:38 - close the deal
115:39 - they go through me first right so if i
115:41 - can't sell them on myself first then
115:43 - they're not gonna use the next stage so
115:45 - let me ask you i'm very curious
115:46 - uh on this one for you this is a
115:49 - business kind of related
115:50 - do you outsource can you outsource
115:52 - yourself like do you
115:53 - think that because you are that core
115:56 - piece right
115:56 - you are that first connection with the
115:58 - with the with the client
116:00 - right do you think that you can have
116:03 - someone else to be that
116:05 - uh yeah i don't think i could outsource
116:07 - myself completely i think i could
116:09 - outsource enough
116:10 - um i think a company gets big enough
116:12 - where their name speaks for themselves
116:14 - they don't have to do the level of
116:16 - selling that we have to do
116:18 - um i think once you get to the point of
116:19 - some of the bigger agencies where
116:20 - they've got 100 people
116:22 - it's pretty obvious they're doing stuff
116:23 - the right way they're doing it well and
116:26 - they're trustworthy except when you work
116:28 - with a smaller team where you've got
116:29 - eight to ten people or even sub like 50
116:32 - people
116:32 - uh you have to have somebody that's
116:34 - really close to the client that's
116:36 - usually the owner the ceo of the company
116:39 - um the way i look at it right now though
116:41 - is if i were trying to if i was trying
116:42 - to outsource myself right now
116:44 - what would stop somebody from from just
116:45 - going and doing their own why would
116:47 - somebody do my job when they can just
116:48 - try and make more
116:49 - that's true that's true that's true and
116:51 - of course from your perspective like
116:52 - your job at this point is you don't see
116:54 - yourself just kind of coding at this
116:55 - point right you don't call it
116:56 - do you i'm very curious do you miss
116:57 - coding or no
116:59 - uh so i i still regularly code um
117:02 - like i'm very very much involved in um
117:05 - like a lot of the architecture and
117:07 - uh setup of projects and helping with
117:09 - some of the more complex problems
117:10 - but um definitely don't spend
117:14 - as much time as i used to on it so i i
117:16 - don't necessarily
117:18 - the time that i do it fulfills me enough
117:21 - that's awesome
117:21 - and then at the time the frustration
117:23 - time that doesn't frustrate you as much
117:25 - as i guess
117:25 - sometimes it could have before yeah
117:29 - yeah because that person for example i
117:30 - sometimes miss coding like like uh
117:32 - i mean i could of course i teach right
117:34 - but my number one thing for me is like i
117:36 - want to be able to like
117:37 - actually because like what happens is
117:39 - when you teach you you unfill your
117:41 - bucket like you've got this bucket of
117:42 - like of knowledge right and you're just
117:43 - trying to pour into everybody else right
117:45 - the most important you need to
117:47 - understand is like
117:47 - how to not fill your bucket at the same
117:49 - time too you know
117:51 - that's the hardest thing now awesome
117:53 - blake
117:55 - it's been [ __ ] amazing yeah it's
