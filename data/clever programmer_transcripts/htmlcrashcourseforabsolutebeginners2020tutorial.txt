00:00 - what's up guys this is Kazi here from
00:01 - clever programmer calm this is we are
00:04 - gonna be your instructors for this html5
00:08 - crash course for beginners so if you're
00:10 - a complete beginner you are in the right
00:11 - place we're not gonna go into the theory
00:13 - we're gonna can just jump right into it
00:16 - this HTML crash course we're gonna go
00:18 - through all of the basics and we're
00:20 - gonna go through fast you know how we do
00:22 - it here we get dirty we get down into it
00:24 - and we just start coding things up and
00:26 - you're not gonna listen to a bunch of
00:28 - boring fluff here that's not what this
00:29 - channel is about so we're gonna get into
00:31 - it really fast now we're gonna be
00:33 - covering how unordered lists work order
00:35 - list works what the hell or header tags
00:37 - how do you actually use tags and how do
00:40 - you create a basic looking web page
00:42 - that's what you're gonna get out of it
00:43 - it's gonna be awesome and before we get
00:45 - into it I do want to say that my team
00:47 - and I have put together a pretty amazing
00:48 - one-hour training for you that's
00:50 - absolutely free if you want to become a
00:52 - web developer or a freelance developer
00:55 - now this training is called top three
00:57 - secrets to become a Python freelancer
00:59 - but it will work perfectly well for you
01:01 - even if you're not a Python freelancer
01:03 - and you want to become a freelancer as a
01:04 - web developer okay it has the main
01:07 - principles that you need and it's
01:09 - unbelievable content and we have made it
01:11 - free for a limited amount of time so go
01:14 - ahead and click that link make sure you
01:16 - sign up for a seat in the webinar and
01:19 - then show off with your notepad or
01:20 - something cuz gonna be really valuable
01:21 - information what that's that let's jump
01:24 - right into this tutorial first things
01:26 - first
01:26 - there are multiple text editors that you
01:28 - can use the one that we recommend is
01:30 - free and it's also one of the best so
01:32 - visual studio code go ahead and download
01:35 - this whichever version you're on I'm on
01:39 - a Mac so I'm gonna just download the Mac
01:41 - version and then as soon as you're done
01:43 - downloading it just open it up install
01:45 - it and then open up a new file in it
01:48 - okay once you open up a new file your
01:50 - screen should look like this we're gonna
01:53 - create a new folder on our desktop I'm
01:55 - going to call it HTML HTML crash course
02:00 - and then inside of this folder we're
02:04 - gonna open this folder from our visual
02:07 - studio code okay
02:09 - so I'll go click here
02:12 - open and we're gonna just select this
02:15 - folder and go ahead and open it let's
02:16 - create a new file okay so let's go back
02:20 - to our visual studio code and we are
02:24 - going to create a new file and hit this
02:26 - and we'll call it index.html now
02:28 - remember this is important if your
02:31 - cursor doesn't look like mine don't
02:33 - worry about that yours will just look
02:34 - like this how it's supposed to I'm using
02:37 - something called vim for more advanced
02:40 - users but again this is a come for a
02:42 - complete beginner so we want you to be
02:43 - able to follow along now I'm just gonna
02:45 - hit save and I'm gonna show you that
02:47 - this file that I just made is actually
02:54 - this file that I just made is gonna be
02:57 - right over here on your computer now
02:59 - okay it should look empty alright now if
03:03 - I type in things here and save them and
03:08 - then I open this up and if I open this
03:10 - file you should see hello things here
03:12 - okay now there are different browsers
03:16 - that you can use you can use Internet
03:17 - Explorer you could use a Mozilla Firefox
03:19 - you could and you could use what else
03:22 - Chrome but you know probably don't use
03:26 - Internet Explorer it's not gonna be good
03:29 - for you so if you want to challenge a
03:30 - real challenge right let's try to stick
03:32 - with using Chrome because this is gonna
03:34 - be the best for you and the easiest way
03:36 - to go now because that's my default
03:39 - browser that's why this index.html file
03:41 - turns into this the extension is very
03:43 - important if you're on Windows or in
03:45 - some other computer and it turns it into
03:47 - dot txt at the end or dot make sure that
03:50 - you change it to dot HTML okay and if
03:54 - you double click it or you open it from
03:55 - your chrome and it looks like this then
03:58 - you're good okay so I hope that you're
04:01 - following along so far now what I'm
04:04 - gonna do is I'm just gonna do that so I
04:11 - have more space on the left-hand side to
04:13 - code I'll also open up this file on the
04:17 - right-hand side so that you can see it
04:22 - so I'll put this here
04:27 - okay let's go right here all right so
04:33 - now if I type in things like you know
04:37 - headings in if you ever go to a website
04:40 - you see things in big giant letters what
04:43 - they're using is something called header
04:45 - tags okay if I go to for example give me
04:49 - a website that's Wikipedia that's a good
04:53 - one okay so let's go to Wikipedia BPD oh
04:58 - all right Wikipedia and let's type in
05:01 - from programming whoops I miss what I
05:05 - put in HTML there you go
05:07 - programming okay so if we look at the
05:11 - structure of how this page is set up
05:13 - mostly it's through HTML there's very
05:15 - little CSS actually used here and in
05:17 - this video we're not gonna be using CSS
05:19 - so things are gonna look ugly things are
05:21 - gonna kind of look like Wikipedia
05:23 - Craigslist all right yeah or Craigslist
05:25 - so let's go here and if I hit inspect
05:29 - right what I'll find out here is that
05:32 - this says h1 so this is actually a
05:35 - heading tag okay so going back to my
05:38 - code if I actually do h1 hit tab and do
05:41 - programming language refresh here these
05:47 - are the heading tags this is why there's
05:49 - this big - cool so let's go ahead and
05:53 - remove this now we need to give our page
05:55 - a structure the first thing you always
05:57 - want to do in your HTML page the reason
05:59 - why I'm just jumping in right away is so
06:01 - there's not so much theory you got to
06:03 - get through
06:05 - I'll explain we'll explain the theory to
06:07 - you as we go through each step not
06:10 - necessarily just in the start so one
06:12 - thing you want to do is you want to do
06:14 - doctype HTML for html5 this is something
06:17 - you always have to do to make sure that
06:20 - your document is interpreted correctly
06:23 - from the browser okay so I'm using
06:25 - Chrome and this will make sure that it's
06:27 - doing it correctly then other tags that
06:31 - we actually need are things like a head
06:33 - tag okay and a body tag
06:36 - all the code you'd you generally write
06:39 - goes in your body tag like this okay
06:45 - yeah all right
06:47 - and then um if you have things like
06:50 - title which is over here where if you
06:53 - see it says index.html well I can change
06:57 - that to cause ease website like this and
07:01 - hit body supposed to be outside of it
07:02 - let me leave your header oh hello eyes
07:05 - watch three yeah I think I'm thinking of
07:09 - theirs head body and then what's the
07:11 - other one that covers everything
07:12 - Oh HTML
07:17 - oh no body contains everything body
07:19 - contains everything body is outside of
07:20 - head and it also contains on your right
07:23 - head or body footer okay okay let me let
07:25 - me redo that okay
07:26 - good cat just get a good catch another
07:29 - session okay so the the first thing you
07:33 - need in your code so we had HTML tags
07:38 - first of all right yeah so now I'm gonna
07:41 - so let's go here and let's remove
07:42 - everything from our page I'm gonna save
07:44 - and I'm gonna go here and refresh okay
07:46 - so I'm doing command s to save and then
07:48 - command or to refresh on Windows is
07:50 - gonna be ctrl s and then ctrl our first
07:55 - thing we need is we're gonna create a
07:57 - head tag and then inside of head we have
08:00 - things like title so if I go coding
08:05 - website or if I do my coding up side
08:09 - save it refresh but you see that title
08:12 - at the top change yeah on the tab on the
08:15 - tabs that name of the web page kind of
08:17 - pretty much right well the title of the
08:19 - page I guess it as its called an HTML
08:21 - yep so we have changed the title now
08:25 - another thing we need are is body tag
08:28 - and inside of body tag is where we write
08:30 - most of the code so now we can put that
08:32 - programming language thing we had
08:34 - earlier in here if I hit refresh you C
08:37 - programming language shows up and all
08:42 - the tags are similar to this right so
08:45 - for example if I change this
08:48 - h4 h5 h6 header tags go all the way to
08:52 - header six and header one is the one
08:55 - with the the biggest one and then header
08:57 - six is these tiniest point right so
09:00 - let's go ahead and do that here mmm
09:08 - magic
09:09 - yeah okay so we have it's almost like
09:14 - this is the most popular programming
09:17 - language all the way to the least
09:19 - popular the tiniest so this is how
09:23 - header tags work now there's something
09:25 - called comments in HTML comments or H
09:30 - first of all hTML is not a programming
09:32 - language it's a markup language but
09:36 - every programming language or most
09:38 - languages general have this ability to
09:39 - write comments comments are not for the
09:42 - computer to interpret they're for the
09:44 - human to read so we can add comments by
09:48 - doing this and I can say header tags
09:54 - okay if I go in here and refresh it
09:56 - doesn't change anything on the page but
09:59 - it definitely puts them here all right
10:01 - now I can show you paragraph tags okay
10:09 - they're also known as P tags and what
10:11 - they allow you to do is just write stuff
10:13 - so let's say I wanted to write things
10:15 - right and I wanted to break them apart
10:16 - well how would I do it let's that right
10:18 - Aaron then I write Kazi and if I hit
10:20 - save and I go here and look it's in the
10:22 - same line yeah it's just like chunking
10:25 - them together
10:25 - exactly and that's not what we want we
10:27 - want them to be separate into new lines
10:29 - right yep yeah so Wikipedia if we go
10:32 - here and if I fullscreen this page you
10:35 - can see that there's a paragraph here
10:37 - and then there's a new paragraph here so
10:40 - what is actually happening can I hit
10:43 - inspect and dig deep into it well what
10:47 - you see here is there's something there
10:49 - using called the P so if I hit in this
10:52 - button over here to inspect element if I
10:55 - hover over this this says you see that
10:57 - little P and purple I can't move my
11:00 - mouse over to that
11:01 - I hope you see where it says color font
11:04 - margin you see it yeah yeah this oh you
11:08 - little box bit up right the box that
11:10 - popped up right underneath where it says
11:11 - article and talk
11:12 - well that P means that this is a P tag
11:15 - if I hover here you see the P show up
11:19 - again so that's the P tag okay now let's
11:25 - go back to our code and put P tags
11:31 - around this okay so let's go P tag like
11:35 - this and then do this copy and I'll take
11:41 - Ozzy and then I'll delete this and if I
11:43 - go here and refresh you can see that now
11:46 - it separated them out into actually two
11:49 - separate lines two separate paragraphs
11:50 - yeah yeah two separate terms and if we
11:54 - have like Aaron is an epic developer oh
12:01 - right
12:03 - fire emoji you don't need to do the fire
12:06 - emoji but I'm just adding that in and
12:09 - then we can say cause II is a better
12:13 - developer sometimes okay yeah and
12:18 - sometimes the end of both of these okay
12:22 - sometimes right okay and you can see
12:26 - that we have different paragraphs now
12:28 - you can also do lorem and hit
12:31 - autocomplete and it it basically creates
12:34 - this lorem ipsum which just means dummy
12:36 - text okay it's a fancy weird way of
12:39 - staying just dummy text most text
12:42 - editors probably have this capability so
12:44 - if you do lorem and you hit tab it will
12:47 - autocomplete it but what we want to do
12:50 - is we want to make sure that we put P
12:52 - tags around it whoops
12:55 - P tags and then I'll do lorem hit tab
12:58 - now you hit tab to autocomplete so when
13:01 - you type stuff it allows you to
13:02 - autocomplete it right so if I do P I can
13:05 - actually just hit tab here and it'll
13:07 - autocomplete it I can do h1 and I can
13:11 - hit tab and then autocomplete it
13:13 - which was BS code and most editors allow
13:16 - you to do that but yet the Lord it's up
13:18 - to you
13:19 - oh yeah it's easier to do the lungs have
13:21 - so if I do refresh
13:23 - it's a translate because it detected
13:25 - this to be like Latin his lines is like
13:28 - yeah so there we have our lorem ipsum
13:33 - now a what are some other things that
13:36 - are really useful that we need to know
13:38 - in HTML well some other common things
13:41 - you need to be able to do is one you
13:43 - want to be able to let's say you're
13:44 - making a video hosting blog post right
13:47 - you want to be able to host videos well
13:49 - you can do that with HTML it's pretty
13:51 - cool
13:51 - so for example let's go to
13:58 - youtube.com/scishow let's take a video
14:01 - so let's take this giant crash course
14:04 - video we have okay so let's take this
14:07 - video alright so let's now go to share
14:10 - so I'll click share right over here and
14:13 - inside a share click embed on a YouTube
14:16 - video copy this code alright
14:18 - you can also hit the button copy here
14:21 - and now just get out of here you don't
14:24 - need to be here anymore okay and you can
14:27 - paste this code alright now if i refresh
14:30 - you'll see that that video is actually
14:33 - embedded into your website now in this
14:36 - tutorial we're not gonna be teaching you
14:37 - how to host this website online yet but
14:40 - we want to show you how to make a useful
14:44 - HTML website that people could actually
14:48 - use and that you would even want to use
14:52 - so now this is using something called
14:54 - the iframe tag here right and some of
14:57 - the things that you might be seeing here
14:58 - is like oh width and height height
15:01 - what's going on here
15:02 - well we're gonna talk about that in a
15:04 - second we're building up to it
15:06 - alright so we've covered P tags we've
15:10 - covered that when you start a tag you
15:12 - got to end the tag so h1 when you start
15:14 - it you got to end it you started here is
15:16 - to you got to end it P tag you start it
15:18 - you got to end it the /p part is a part
15:21 - that allows you to end it yeah it's like
15:24 - a ND tag exactly start
15:26 - tagging ending tag yep for most tags now
15:28 - when you see code to write what you
15:31 - should try to do oftentimes it's play
15:33 - with it mess it up see what happens so
15:35 - for example if I go again to YouTube
15:39 - that video right you can actually change
15:41 - code on the fly right and now what I can
15:44 - do is let's say I do hit inspect element
15:47 - and I highlight it and I hit inspect
15:49 - element right right over here and I can
15:53 - click into it and says python full
15:55 - course for beginners and I can say
16:01 - JavaScript crash course by Aaron Wright
16:09 - and all of a sudden it's changed I can
16:13 - go here and I can hit inspect and over
16:17 - here it says 18,000 views I can say - -
16:21 - built put ten billion right - two
16:28 - million three hundred eighty-seven
16:29 - thousand views on this video and I can
16:33 - also go click here and I can change this
16:37 - to 0.5 to be like alright so a great job
16:46 - when the jobs from crash course right
16:48 - teleports the future you guys yeah so
16:50 - you killed it make sure you don't forget
16:52 - that so there you have it right you can
16:56 - go and play with HTML code already you
16:59 - can go and play with it on the websites
17:01 - you know do funny jokes with your
17:03 - friends I mean there's a lot that you
17:05 - can do with HTML it's gonna zoom out
17:09 - here a little bit so we have more space
17:12 - and and then zoom in here zoom out here
17:17 - okay great now let's go back okay so
17:25 - this shows you that you can you can play
17:28 - with HTML code now it won't stay there
17:31 - if i refresh this page is gonna go away
17:32 - it's just temporary it's only on your
17:35 - computer but it's still really important
17:37 - to be able to practice
17:38 - and play like that because when you
17:41 - practice that's how you improve you want
17:43 - to be able to tinker these things and
17:45 - change them and then you keep improving
17:46 - your skillset that way all right let's
17:50 - continue so if you see this with try
17:54 - changing it and do 300 and come here and
17:56 - refresh and see what happens
17:58 - oh it changed right let's go here and
18:01 - change the height and go here and
18:03 - refresh oh now the height is bigger and
18:06 - this is how you're gonna get a lot
18:09 - better by constantly practicing it right
18:11 - this one video or one crash course you
18:13 - see from somebody is not gonna change
18:16 - everything but if you keep practicing it
18:19 - that's how you'll improve okay let's add
18:21 - more things to this let's add maybe what
18:24 - you would do we had images oh yeah okay
18:26 - we skipped images illustrate the videos
18:29 - with right we we went in more advanced
18:31 - so let's add images right so let's just
18:33 - so easy since it's even simpler the
18:35 - videos I like a chess board so chess
18:38 - board I'll type that in let's go to
18:40 - images nice and we'll find some image
18:45 - here was it's just which which one
18:48 - should we pick that one this one yeah
18:51 - sure okay so I'll right click here and
18:53 - I'll say copy image address so if I open
18:57 - a new tab and I hit it should ya get
18:59 - this I just hosted at that URL yep
19:01 - so now I'll go here I'll type in IMG and
19:05 - I he'll hit tab and it'll auto complete
19:08 - it okay so in here now there's this
19:11 - thing called source source is asking
19:13 - what's the source is it local or is it
19:15 - online well we're not gonna host this
19:18 - locally we're gonna pull it from online
19:20 - because most of the times I'm pulling
19:21 - stuff from online right and most people
19:23 - aren't makes your life easier and I'm
19:26 - just gonna hit paste on that link that I
19:28 - had found so this link might actually
19:32 - not work because kind of fun yeah it
19:35 - doesn't actually look like that you
19:37 - doesn't look like a URL does it
19:39 - how long does I think you copied the
19:42 - wrong thing man I did you know it's
19:45 - showing huh
19:47 - so I'm fine
19:51 - Jesus Christ let's say there's three
19:54 - dots at the end so it keeps going is
19:56 - this three okay so well we can get is we
19:58 - can say copy link address maybe but then
20:02 - that doesn't get us what we want so I'm
20:06 - fine so if you can do this there you go
20:09 - you can get an image like this okay
20:11 - apparently it's a convoluted URL what
20:13 - would be the better way to get it copy
20:18 - image address that's what we did right
20:22 - so I guess this is a better link right
20:27 - by clicking into it so what I can do is
20:30 - I can do image and then paste it and now
20:33 - you have a more normal URL whew that URL
20:37 - freaks you yeah it was like data : or
20:39 - something so there you go you have the
20:41 - image okay and now to play around with
20:44 - this image well you can actually have
20:46 - there are these attributes you can have
20:48 - in images okay so you can pass a inside
20:54 - of HTML tag you can also pass it
20:56 - attributes so here we'll pass it for alt
20:59 - well alt is mostly useful for one the
21:03 - computers and the crawlers for example
21:06 - if the computer comes here and it
21:08 - doesn't know what damage is having an
21:10 - alternative description will tell the
21:12 - computer what it actually is and another
21:15 - thing is useful for I don't know if you
21:17 - know this it's useful for if there's a
21:19 - somebody who's blind and they're on your
21:21 - website yeah yeah you know a lot of
21:27 - blind people actually use websites and
21:28 - use computers I have I have I had a
21:31 - friend yeah I had a friend who was blind
21:33 - and he had a laptop and he would open it
21:35 - up and he would go and go through his
21:38 - search directory he would search up
21:40 - stuff he would know when the internet is
21:42 - down really like dizzy no seriously he
21:47 - had a contact book everything wait does
21:49 - it read it out to you like verbally or
21:50 - something no they they have Braille oh
21:52 - but we don't have Braille here while you
21:55 - do blind people know how to read Braille
21:58 - their computer is like a Braille tool as
22:01 - well
22:01 - yeah I seen that before yeah so there
22:05 - you go that's why you need an
22:07 - alternative description now other times
22:09 - you can add is definitely width and
22:11 - height so let's say with we make the
22:14 - width
22:14 - 400 and if I go here well you can see
22:18 - the board size just changed okay and
22:20 - then we can make the height of it you
22:24 - know 300 it might actually be around
22:28 - that so there it made the height a
22:30 - little bit yeah that kind of skewed work
22:33 - the image a little bit yep
22:34 - so this is how you make images right so
22:40 - I'll put image tag because images are
22:45 - useful now some other things you can do
22:47 - that are useful is what if you need to
22:49 - make something in link so if it says
22:52 - Erin and if it says Kazi well what if it
22:54 - linked to Erin's
22:56 - Instagram profile or a cause ease
22:59 - Instagram profile so let's go here and
23:02 - let's go instagram.com slash clever
23:04 - cause E and if we actually go here this
23:08 - is my Instagram correct so now I'm gonna
23:11 - grab this URL copy it X out of this and
23:14 - what I'll do is I'll put cause the
23:16 - inside of something called an 8a tag
23:19 - okay so I'll try it here and I'll do a
23:23 - and hit tab little autocomplete it it's
23:26 - asking for a link so I'll link it to
23:29 - Instagram comm slash clever cos e then
23:32 - I'll put the text here that says if okay
23:36 - so first of all watch what happens right
23:37 - if I hit save and I go to the website
23:39 - okay I'm just gonna delete the lorem
23:41 - ipsum because it's getting in the way it
23:42 - keeps asking about the translation there
23:45 - we go so I'm gonna go here now can you
23:48 - find on the screen where it's showing
23:50 - the link no no yeah well the reason why
23:54 - it's not showing is because you have to
23:56 - add text here yeah I saw that I could
24:00 - display this blaze exactly I display it
24:02 - so now we add the text I'll say cause
24:05 - ease profile safe and hit refresh well
24:10 - you have cause ease profile now if I
24:12 - click this it'll actually
24:15 - to it yeah it's the URL that we put in
24:17 - the HOF which is just a reference it's
24:18 - like where does it where as this text
24:21 - going to refer to yep
24:22 - now what if we don't want the people all
24:24 - who are on our website to leave from our
24:26 - website instead we want them to set open
24:28 - up a new tab okay well we do something
24:31 - called we pass in an attribute called
24:34 - target and we say go to blank all right
24:39 - which is it's kind of a weird way of
24:41 - doing this it should be something like
24:42 - target new tab instead of underscore
24:45 - blank but you'll see what it does if I
24:48 - hit it now I open up a new tab rather
24:51 - than rather than it going to a
24:56 - completely new website okay okay now
25:02 - what if I want to make this causey a
25:04 - link which is inside of a P tag well you
25:06 - can do that you can nest tags however
25:09 - deeply you want so I can actually go a
25:14 - tag here I can say href equals and I can
25:19 - do the same Instagram link right I can
25:23 - go like this and then in between here I
25:27 - can put causey
25:32 - where did we go
25:36 - they're all right so watch what happens
25:39 - now when i refresh
25:40 - Kazi is now a link if I click it it
25:43 - opens 10 Instagram profile all right and
25:49 - I can do the same thing I can add that
25:52 - target yep you tap target statement like
25:58 - that oops
26:04 - done if I go refresh now if I hit cause
26:10 - II you'll open up a new tab rather than
26:12 - go redirect during the website and I can
26:15 - remove this now where it said Cosby's
26:18 - profile okay
26:23 - so we can do header tags we can do
26:26 - paragraph tags we can do images you just
26:29 - learned how to actually embed a YouTube
26:31 - video what else can we do with HTML
26:36 - there's a lot you can create tables
26:39 - don't do that next or lists actually
26:42 - let's do list yeah we can do tape so we
26:44 - can create lots of other things like for
26:47 - example let's say we wanted to have a
26:49 - list of programming languages okay so
26:53 - first there's something called unordered
26:55 - list and then there's something called
26:56 - ordered list let's start with unordered
27:02 - lists all right so what we're gonna do
27:06 - is we're gonna say ul and then inside of
27:09 - this ul tag we want to do list item like
27:12 - this and I will say JavaScript and we
27:20 - will say Python Python JavaScript and
27:25 - then we'll say Java and then PHP or
27:29 - something right and if I hit refresh
27:31 - you'll see we have an unordered list at
27:34 - the bottom which is actually pretty
27:36 - difficult to see so what I'm gonna do is
27:41 - let's actually I'm gonna add in a bunch
27:46 - of gibberish at the bottom okay so I'm
27:50 - going to create a P tag and then I'm
27:53 - gonna say gibberish ignore and then I'm
27:58 - just going to keep pasting it
28:05 - good little bunch of line great Smitty
28:07 - or just empty key tags actually
28:16 - okay hold on okay cool so I wrote
28:24 - gibberish and I'm gonna put a HR to
28:30 - basically separate separate the garbage
28:34 - at the bottom okay
28:36 - you can use H HR for you know if you're
28:39 - trying to fire somebody from Facebook
28:41 - just kidding it is a charm for that's a
28:49 - mean one huh yeah what's next so again
28:56 - you can use HR for just this horizontal
29:00 - row they can add but we here is we have
29:04 - the unordered list and you can see them
29:06 - clearly like so all right now we're
29:09 - gonna do and we're gonna create an
29:11 - ordered list so I'm gonna copy this I'm
29:15 - gonna paste it here I'm gonna change
29:18 - this o to a you I mean you do an O so
29:21 - now it's an ordered list
29:30 - like that and if I hit and refresh
29:34 - you'll see now that it has order of the
29:37 - languages now the correct order would be
29:41 - this and you have each of the items in a
29:50 - list you have them in an ordered list
29:52 - now a lot of people who are Python
29:55 - developers on this channel the reason
29:56 - why learning HTML could be useful for
29:59 - and important for you is a lot of web
30:01 - scraping that you do you need to know
30:03 - how HTML works ok I'm going to zoom in
30:07 - so you guys can see everything a lot
30:09 - clearly a lot more clearly so when
30:11 - you're doing development and you're
30:16 - trying to a lot of web scraping well you
30:17 - need to know how the HTML pages are
30:20 - structured how they work in order for
30:23 - you to actually do web scraping
30:24 - otherwise is gonna be really hard and
30:29 - literally everything on the internet
30:31 - uses HTML literally yeah except for that
30:34 - data colon thing about how that was did
30:37 - hit a chord image but yeah that was
30:40 - probably some API it's unrelated let's
30:46 - just never talk about that one again so
30:48 - we have order lists we have unordered
30:50 - lists and this is important for you know
30:53 - obvious reasons
30:54 - and it does a lot of the logic
30:56 - automatically okay again we're not doing
30:58 - any styling right now okay another
31:02 - things that are important to learn about
31:05 - our well if you want it to have like you
31:10 - know if somebody could put in their
31:12 - phone number on your website or their
31:13 - email on your website or their name
31:15 - your website or maybe what item you know
31:19 - you wanted to take some a quiz maybe how
31:22 - do you actually ask for those inputs
31:25 - yeah okay so when you have a forum on a
31:31 - page where does the forum take you
31:33 - that's the action for example if you go
31:37 - on facebook.com and you hit login you
31:39 - hit that submit button your luck oh well
31:43 - it takes you to the Facebook homepage
31:45 - correct that's the action so action is
31:49 - for example Facebook on facebook.com
31:52 - alright or that's the action and when
32:00 - you have something like a index.html or
32:04 - you or on your local website if you
32:06 - actually write this this basically is
32:09 - the this basically means like a slash
32:12 - I'm gonna write this in comments like a
32:16 - slash it means means facebook.com for
32:23 - example and it about like a slash about
32:30 - would mean that does that make sense
32:35 - mm-hmm wait about means facebook.com
32:38 - slash about okay because your slash
32:40 - about that I mean I know it's a little
32:44 - convoluted how it's written but so here
32:48 - if you wrote slash that would be the
32:51 - equivalent of the action being
32:53 - facebook.com/ or yourwebsite.com okay
32:59 - then we have something called method and
33:03 - Method will what that means is you can
33:06 - either have a get method or a post
33:09 - method so an example is when you go on
33:12 - Facebook and you put in your login
33:15 - information you hit that submit button
33:17 - well what request is it sending what's
33:20 - the method that it's using there
33:24 - post yes so using it's hard to lose it
33:28 - so it's using it's really early here
33:30 - guys that's like it's a damn now we've
33:34 - been going since 6:00 a.m. so II was
33:38 - gonna say so ATM so that's what's
33:42 - happening right this is the the post
33:46 - method when you are trying to get some
33:49 - information to retrieve some kind of
33:51 - information for example when you go to
33:53 - your best friend's homepage wall and you
33:57 - type in their name and you go there and
33:59 - it shows you their latest photos their
34:00 - latest post what method is that yet
34:04 - that's the get method how it's fast at
34:06 - that time so when you're getting stuff
34:08 - you're getting you're using the get
34:10 - method when you update your post that's
34:12 - gonna be the update method and when you
34:14 - delete your post that's the obviously
34:17 - delete method but here we're just gonna
34:19 - do get method now but this is all for
34:23 - server-side for HTML this is not gonna
34:26 - the method is not going to be making
34:28 - that much difference right now now what
34:30 - we're going to do is we're going to put
34:33 - in an input and this input can have a
34:36 - type of text and we'll give it a name
34:45 - this is for server-side that's some more
34:47 - important so we're gonna say name we can
34:51 - actually just say name here like this
34:53 - just go here and refresh so you see that
34:56 - there's something here input okay now
35:00 - there are different ways to go about how
35:03 - you can actually use labels so I wanted
35:05 - to bring this up for some people who are
35:07 - maybe a little bit more advanced I
35:09 - generally like to use this way whenever
35:12 - I can
35:13 - but again don't read too much into
35:15 - what's happening here it might be too
35:17 - advanced for you for most people most
35:19 - beginners you don't have to worry about
35:20 - it but you can just focus on
35:22 - understanding the idea of it okay and
35:24 - Stack Overflow is one of the most common
35:26 - places you've got to get used to so it's
35:28 - better if you take your fear out of
35:30 - using it at an earlier stage so we're
35:34 - gonna go back and we're gonna you
35:36 - this type of thing right so I'm going to
35:38 - copy this and we can paste it here and
35:41 - we'll delete what we had earlier and
35:44 - I'll format this and let's get out of
35:45 - here okay so what you want to do here is
35:50 - I'll refresh okay
35:52 - now idea I don't want you to worry about
35:55 - the ID you can just remove that and hit
35:57 - refresh so whatever your input is the
36:01 - input is going to go here and this is
36:04 - the title so if you want people to write
36:07 - in their name well this is where you
36:09 - gotta write write it so that's gonna be
36:12 - the label okay you can call this
36:15 - whatever you want you call this name
36:17 - sure here again you can call it whatever
36:21 - you want but we can call it name this is
36:23 - gonna be useful for the server side
36:26 - not necessarily the HTML side okay so we
36:30 - have something we can do something with
36:32 - right but we can't do it any further
36:35 - because like you can see just broke my
36:38 - computer did something weird so I can't
36:40 - actually submit this anywhere yet I
36:43 - can't it's not a form yet so what we
36:46 - want to do is add in maybe a few more
36:48 - things for example you can have a name
36:52 - well what other things do people put in
36:54 - a huge edge email gender whatever
36:59 - numbers so let's go and put an email
37:06 - okay I'll go email like this and we'll
37:12 - put in this and for type we're actually
37:16 - going to change it to email now if I hit
37:21 - refresh you'll see there's an email here
37:23 - and we got that another thing we want to
37:29 - do is let's use div tags because these
37:31 - are pretty important and let's start
37:34 - putting
37:37 - things into divs because what you'll see
37:40 - is they like start organizing them in a
37:42 - nicer way so we'll put that one into div
37:45 - and then we'll do the same thing here
37:52 - why are you finished okay there so I
37:58 - have a name I have email and I have them
38:03 - formatted in a correct way and they're
38:06 - under the form tag so that's the
38:08 - important part the reason why we created
38:13 - a type called email is it's built into
38:16 - HTML and this adds in email validation
38:19 - so if you're typing in stuff and you're
38:22 - not typing in the correct email it
38:24 - eventually tell you and it'll give you
38:27 - an error if you type in the wrong emails
38:29 - it won't let you submit the form and
38:32 - then last thing we need is a submit
38:35 - button all right so we can have just any
38:38 - kind of button or we can
38:40 - let's go like this we can do input and
38:47 - do submit and we do label okay so we can
38:54 - just have a regular input with the type
38:57 - submit and that by default shows the
39:02 - text of it being submit
39:10 - right and you can change it's what it
39:13 - says in the button by changing the value
39:17 - over here so you can change the value to
39:19 - click me if you want if I go here it'll
39:22 - say click me and I can click it ok so
39:31 - there you go you can type in stuff here
39:33 - you can do this and then you can say
39:35 - click me and as you can see the email
39:36 - one complains that it's not a proper
39:39 - email so now if I do
39:42 - Kazi right now it didn't complain it
39:48 - actually allowed me to click it and in
39:50 - the URL you can see that it's passing in
39:54 - the argument name ffrr which you typed
39:57 - in and the email is causing a clip yep
40:01 - and it's taking me to my home page
40:03 - because of this action that I have here
40:05 - so it's taking me to some weird page
40:09 - let's refresh right if I don't do
40:14 - anything if I just do this at gmail.com
40:18 - and I hit refresh it'll just bring me
40:20 - back here so you can actually you can
40:23 - also just leave it blank as well so
40:28 - these are these are my forms
40:33 - [Applause]
40:37 - what are other useful things for us to
40:41 - be able to use well there are a few
40:44 - things that we can also add to form so
40:46 - we can add things that allow us to
40:50 - select right and we can also add things
40:55 - that allow us to create tables okay so
41:03 - let's go ahead and create a table and
41:10 - table needs two things it needs a head
41:14 - so we're gonna leave that here and then
41:17 - it needs a table body so inside the
41:21 - table head we're gonna create a row and
41:25 - inside of that row we're gonna create a
41:28 - cell and this we're gonna call it
41:40 - we can call it or should we call it
41:42 - should be th rate title headers not too
41:45 - deep oh yeah you're right so th what you
41:48 - gonna call it
41:48 - let's just put age or name email age
41:54 - name email age yep and boom look at this
42:02 - it shows up right over here
42:10 - cool cool now let's add in the body so
42:17 - we'll have a row and then I'll do table
42:22 - cell taste with data table data so we're
42:27 - defining a table row that's TR and then
42:29 - within that row we're gonna have table
42:31 - data over and over each of those is like
42:32 - one of the elements yeah kind of like
42:34 - the columns but you you define it by
42:36 - Road not by column so you say in a row
42:38 - this is all the data one by one we'll
42:41 - have Aaron we'll have Aaron at and calm
42:47 - and then we'll have please don't leave
42:51 - money well have age is 24 so there you
42:59 - go it doesn't look like a useful table
43:01 - generally you're not writing many tables
43:05 - directly in HTML if you are creating
43:09 - tables you're gonna be using some kind
43:10 - of themes like CSS stylesheets and yeah
43:16 - you're not openly writing tables right
43:19 - in here like this but this is how you
43:22 - would do it and just to give you an idea
43:24 - how you can add more cells
43:31 - is you can just keep doing this table
43:37 - bro you just add more and more rows for
43:40 - each different row in the table right
43:44 - and then it'll just keep adding it over
43:46 - and over again so I can change this to
43:49 - 20 cause II well that's not true five
43:57 - Kazi at aaron calm there we go
44:00 - you go in so I got my age I got my name
44:07 - I got my email and this is how you
44:09 - create a table all right this is the
44:14 - important thing that you have to
44:16 - understand behind how you create tables
44:18 - though you're not spending a lot of time
44:20 - creating tables okay so create it just
44:22 - if you have to use it for basic use
44:25 - cases just because you're doing some
44:28 - dummy testing but don't actually create
44:30 - it in like full-on projects because it
44:33 - doesn't look that beautiful now I want
44:37 - to show you some important things that
44:38 - people don't show is the googling skills
44:41 - required to be able to do stuff this is
44:44 - gonna be very common so how do you
44:46 - create a drop-down in HTML right so if I
44:49 - do drop-down in HTML well how do I do
44:53 - that
44:53 - luckily w3 school is gonna come up a lot
44:56 - in your journey there's something you
44:58 - got to get used to and inside of here it
45:02 - talks about well if you write this code
45:04 - will create a drop-down try it yourself
45:06 - so I'm gonna copy this and I'm just
45:08 - going to go ahead and paste it inside of
45:10 - that form
45:11 - that we actually created earlier and
45:14 - let's go here and hit refresh and now
45:17 - you'll see that and I'll make sure I'll
45:22 - put everything in its own div so I'll
45:24 - wrap it up in a div like this
45:31 - whoa
45:36 - so I'll make sure I wrap it up in a div
45:39 - I'll hit refresh and now I can see my
45:43 - name email and also my form requires me
45:46 - to put whether I'm putting Volvo or Saab
45:51 - or Mercedes or Audie alright and then I
45:59 - can hit click me and then it'll like
46:01 - pass in all of those values and I can
46:06 - see some of them right for example name
46:08 - fef email cause yet whatever cool so you
46:14 - can actually put that inside of your
46:16 - form so this is how you will add in drop
46:19 - down into your code so w3 and these
46:25 - things are gonna be common learn how to
46:27 - use them this is how you're gonna
46:28 - actually write a lot of your code and
46:31 - figure out a lot of problems by yourself
46:34 - okay so this is pretty good what else do
46:38 - we need
46:39 - [Music]
46:47 - I was looking at that okay another thing
46:51 - that we can add in our form that I want
46:54 - to show you guys that could be important
46:55 - is maybe say you're making a website
46:57 - where somebody could have a contact view
47:00 - form so you want them to put their name
47:03 - you want them to put in you want them to
47:05 - put their choice of their car but you
47:08 - also want them to send you a message
47:10 - okay right like what their message
47:13 - should be so we want we don't want it to
47:16 - just be like a text field because that's
47:18 - kind of annoying for somebody to write a
47:20 - full message in a text like I feel like
47:24 - this so what we're gonna do instead is
47:27 - we're gonna create if new thing and
47:30 - first of all I'm gonna I'm gonna create
47:34 - a div I'm gonna put it inside of here
47:35 - and it's called text area so you want to
47:39 - put it in the text area okay so I
47:41 - detects area I hit tab and it
47:43 - auto-completed it with a lot of these
47:44 - defaults well we'll say the name is
47:47 - message the ID is message an ID right
47:56 - now for this tutorial doesn't matter at
47:59 - all
47:59 - sit refresh and let's go here now you
48:02 - can see messages there box like this so
48:05 - I can change it by doing instead of
48:07 - having it's at 30 I can say 10 and hit
48:10 - refresh I'll change the size of it so
48:14 - the default is good and the cool thing
48:16 - about messages they can drag it up and
48:18 - down
48:19 - they can write a lot in it yeah so
48:27 - that's what's great about it okay guys
48:30 - that's it for now we have to go to the
48:33 - gym this has been your instructor Rafa
48:36 - cozy and Erin Burnett we love your face
48:39 - and we're gonna pick back up from here
48:42 - in part two okay guys welcome back we
48:48 - are here for part two as your
48:50 - instructors for this HTML crash course
48:53 - damn I like that we weren't anything
48:56 - hurt there all right let's go so a few
48:59 - things what we want to do is
49:01 - um we want to make sure is first of all
49:05 - just add an HTML tag here cuz we forgot
49:07 - to add at last video so have yeah it's
49:13 - it's really not it's still working okay
49:16 - and then make sure you grab everything
49:19 - and you indent it inside all right so
49:24 - everything should be inside of the HTML
49:26 - tag us a proper proper yeah I don't know
49:29 - why I put air quotation say this is a
49:30 - proper way to do it so do that now what
49:34 - I want to show you guys is how do you
49:36 - link back and forth between like files
49:38 - so say you had another file locally well
49:41 - how would you link between that so let's
49:46 - create a new file okay yep so I'm gonna
49:53 - go here I'm gonna go a new file like
49:56 - that and we'll call it you - oh whoops
49:59 - let's hit save on it command s and I'm
50:03 - saving it in my HTML crash course page
50:05 - and I'm gonna call it YouTube dot HTML
50:09 - like that
50:10 - alright so it should have this HTML
50:13 - symbol next to it maybe yours might not
50:16 - but should have that extension at least
50:18 - now if you click here and you go here
50:20 - you should have YouTube HTML like that
50:23 - alright now depending on what text
50:26 - editor you were on if you type in HTML
50:29 - and hit auto complete it'll all auto
50:31 - complete it to a bunch of things but on
50:33 - vs code it won't so on vs code you'll
50:36 - have to type doc hit tab and it'll
50:39 - autocomplete it to this so a few of
50:43 - these things is just good practice to
50:45 - have how vs code has it so you can kind
50:50 - of leave that without worrying about
50:51 - what it does too much okay but if we
50:55 - look at you know for example this meta
50:58 - tag here this makes it easier for mobile
51:00 - devices
51:01 - this adds utf-8 which again if you're
51:05 - learning if you're just learning about
51:07 - HTML you probably don't have to worry
51:08 - that much about what this is this part
51:11 - over here document well this is my you
51:15 - to site okay now let's open this up in
51:20 - Chrome desktop HTML crash course YouTube
51:26 - HTML and something you had you can't see
51:34 - probably so I'll close out of other tabs
51:39 - is it says my YouTube site here at the
51:45 - top now what I want to do is just add
51:48 - some things here like my YouTube site
51:53 - and hit refresh now this is here okay
51:56 - what I want to do is I want this file
52:00 - index.html file to link to the YouTube
52:02 - got HTML file and I also want the
52:05 - YouTube at HTML file to link back to D
52:08 - index dot HTML file yeah exactly
52:15 - so we'll say I'm gonna create a a link
52:19 - so here I want you to pause and think
52:21 - about how you would do it solve this
52:23 - problem before actually continuing the
52:26 - video now if you have solved it will
52:30 - give you four seconds four three two one
52:33 - alright let's jump right back into it so
52:37 - for H ref I will just simply say index
52:42 - dot HTML then we also want to add text
52:45 - so I'll say go or I'll just say homepage
52:48 - home home is fine and if i refresh here
52:52 - now home comes up and if I click here
52:54 - it'll take me to the home page alright
52:58 - and if I go to index dot HTML and if I
53:02 - add it somewhere like here and I add
53:08 - that in right basically add a header tag
53:11 - inside of the body and what you want to
53:14 - add in there are things like you know
53:17 - your webpage links you know right at the
53:21 - top or maybe you know what else goes in
53:25 - the header
53:25 - I mean theoretically in HTML you can put
53:29 - anything anywhere and it'll still do
53:31 - something but usually good practice is
53:33 - just stuff that gotta be at the top so
53:34 - like maybe yeah like a navbar your logo
53:38 - some people put it in the actual head
53:39 - tag up there like up there mm-hmm I mean
53:42 - way of there as long as you understand
53:47 - the general idea of what's going on then
53:48 - yeah header just put kind of like stuff
53:50 - that would be at the top of the page in
53:52 - the header tag so it's just kind of when
53:53 - somebody comes to your HTML code they
53:55 - don't the heck is going on like if
53:56 - somebody's trying to web scrape you our
53:57 - web site just make it easier them you
53:59 - know yep so let's go over here and we'll
54:03 - add in a link to the you know YouTube
54:09 - website so I'm going to do link we will
54:13 - do YouTube dot HTML and I'll say my
54:17 - YouTube site boom so now I can navigate
54:28 - back and forth between the two sites
54:30 - that I've created
54:31 - you can't this type of path this path
54:35 - file path is called a relative path
54:38 - because they are close to each other so
54:40 - that's relative you can also do absolute
54:47 - paths which is the absolute path from
54:50 - the start of your computer to this file
54:52 - but from the root of your computer to
54:55 - this file but we just want to care about
54:56 - the relative path generally and using
55:01 - the same type of pads you can add in
55:03 - images or whatnot all right so we got a
55:09 - link we can navigate back and forth
55:12 - between these now what else do you want
55:17 - to do well okay a good way to go about
55:21 - increasing your skills and developing
55:24 - projects is like look at something that
55:25 - you want to be able to build and then
55:27 - kind of model that try to build that so
55:30 - that's kind of what we're gonna do here
55:32 - let's go ahead to this page right that
55:36 - we had opened earlier
55:39 - and if I look at this I want to kind of
55:41 - mimic this page basically I want to
55:43 - build my own personal type of personal
55:47 - style YouTube so what I want to do is I
55:52 - will first of all take the embed code of
55:55 - this so I will say embed I will copy and
56:01 - I'm gonna paste that here alright now
56:05 - when i refresh this should be there
56:07 - perfect okay also in the header whoops
56:17 - we're gonna go ahead and put the home
56:19 - page so we stay consistent this refresh
56:28 - great now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
56:33 - put the title of this so again try this
56:36 - on your own before you follow anything
56:39 - that we're doing you should always try
56:41 - to pause do it on your own otherwise you
56:42 - will not learn these things to put up
56:48 - with the title at the bottom right just
56:51 - like how YouTube has it yeah yeah a
57:00 - smart ok perfect let's do that so well
57:04 - another thing we want to do is we want
57:06 - to add these hashtags that I have in the
57:08 - video python tutorial clever program or
57:10 - Python programming so we'll add that in
57:13 - and what we'll do to add that in is we
57:17 - will use something called the small tag
57:21 - and I'll do clever programmer Python
57:25 - programming and you know hash tag
57:29 - tutorial and just kind of leave it like
57:31 - that
57:31 - yeah perfect looking better huh
57:39 - so now we have that we can do probably a
57:43 - similar thing with views or publish so
57:46 - we can say like when I was published and
57:50 - I think we can also do that in small
57:53 - tags
58:04 - nice wait is that below or above the
58:07 - views on the actual YouTube it's below
58:10 - the views so we'll just pop the views
58:12 - above it yeah sure you can pop the views
58:18 - above it if we want so let's go here we
58:24 - can put that in small tags as well right
58:28 - or no or something for her head or five
58:39 - whatever we want this is what YouTube
58:46 - you should look like in its first
58:47 - iteration so like we're pretty like much
58:49 - pioneers at this point right this is
58:55 - looking great so there we have a pretty
58:58 - much simple version of a YouTube clone I
59:02 - wonder what else we should add yeah we
59:13 - can add the logo copy image address and
59:19 - we can do that right next to the right
59:22 - underneath the views right we can do
59:26 - image and I can pop that in oh no this
59:33 - is HTTP this is a fairly normal and it
59:36 - ends yep and what I want to do is
59:56 - I want to create a div that has both of
60:00 - these guys in there
60:04 - the clever programmer title and D
60:10 - premiered like I wanted in one place or
60:15 - sorry the clever programmer logo and
60:18 - then that should be good
60:26 - and I'm gonna create ap tag put this
60:33 - image in there and then after this image
60:40 - let's just put the words clever
60:42 - programmer keep it really basic let's go
60:46 - back and we have the clever program or
60:49 - logo a long way premiered and clever
61:00 - programmer okay so something limited
61:09 - with HTML yeah like I can adjust the
61:13 - width and the size of this I can do with
61:18 - 300 and then I can do
61:30 - oh let's make it fifty by fifty even
61:39 - better right now now it looks more like
61:43 - the actual logo and why don't we build
61:48 - the the channel channel name because I
61:51 - think it's bold on the YouTube YouTube
61:55 - page right channel name you're clever
61:58 - programmer
61:58 - oh okay so yeah I'm strong tags we can
62:03 - begin bold at two so let's use strong
62:06 - tag
62:14 - they're so strong tag you can use that
62:20 - to bold things you can use the emphasis
62:23 - tag to I don't think there's a bold tags
62:26 - unless there is no bold is actually not
62:30 - used anymore they try not to use it i I
62:33 - think it still works but I think they
62:36 - don't use it anymore let's see oh maybe
62:40 - they're just completely bold tag html5
62:45 - write deprecated that's what I was
62:46 - trying to say be tag not bold tag that's
62:50 - right BJ
62:53 - yeah it's deprecated since HTML 4 yep so
63:05 - remove but another one you can use is M
63:12 - and this will italicize what you are
63:18 - trying to do so let's delete this as
63:22 - well all right now if i refresh we can
63:29 - link back and forth we have actual clone
63:40 - of the Youtube version which is pretty
63:43 - good and then obviously like if you want
63:48 - to kind of add this in a footer you can
63:51 - create a footer and in the footer so if
63:54 - footer tags is generally the stuff at
63:56 - the bottom the copyright stuff you'll
63:57 - see or so you can say I can say clever
64:03 - programmer make sure it's a P tag
64:12 - right and 2019 or something like that
64:17 - and how did they do copy
64:20 - 5% copies illegal there's like little
64:25 - codes here to get things I think you put
64:27 - like TM you can get TM to or like like
64:30 - all those different little symbols like
64:32 - there's something there just google it
64:33 - like there's no point memorizing them
64:34 - all just google it and then you'll find
64:36 - the code trademark copyright I guess you
64:44 - can use a reg registered register so you
64:50 - can also do like this trade okay
64:57 - and now shows up there like that oh yeah
65:09 - apparently now we are so there you have
65:15 - a basic you have a basic looking website
65:21 - it has most of the functionality you
65:23 - want it to have and we have covered a
65:27 - lot of things up until this point we can
65:31 - show you very basic CSS and I'll show it
65:35 - kind of right in here so for example I
65:39 - can go into this P tag and remember we
65:42 - talked about attributes so you can have
65:44 - width and height of an image for example
65:46 - we can also do style of something and I
65:50 - can say text align and I can say Center
65:53 - and if I go here and refresh now you can
65:56 - see how it's hiding behind our video so
66:01 - I have to move it here and now you can
66:04 - actually see it okay it's centered it so
66:08 - i'll uncensor it just so you can see
66:13 - it's better so that's what centering
66:18 - does right now if I remove that and save
66:21 - it refresh let's try something else
66:24 - let's try star
66:26 - font so just color and you can pick
66:29 - whatever color you want what which color
66:31 - do you want
66:32 - Aran's go red for youtube or its
66:36 - copyright right
66:38 - alright so if i refresh you can see that
66:41 - it's colored guys this is not HTML
66:44 - anymore now we're starting to get into
66:45 - styling this is the CSS part of things
66:49 - so we are not going to get into the CSS
66:52 - any further we just wanted to share the
66:56 - very basics with you but that's actually
66:58 - how any website gets designed and it
67:02 - goes beyond just like the most basic
67:05 - HTML that you see right here anything
67:08 - else we need to cover Aaron or we did a
67:11 - pretty good job for somebody who's
67:13 - trying to learn for the first time yeah
67:17 - I mean there's there's way more you can
67:19 - find but whatever you need to do and
67:21 - achieve for the website you just google
67:23 - it because you're never gonna memorize
67:24 - all of it but I mean we've pretty much
67:26 - gone over all the basic ideas the main
67:28 - the most used tags like use your HTML
67:30 - tags use the header tag the head tag
67:32 - body tag images and high frames all the
67:35 - different h1 through h6 all that stuff
67:39 - div tags these are very common so
67:41 - definitely memorize those but I mean
67:43 - there's there's like I don't know how
67:45 - many there are but it's probably
67:45 - hundreds of tags out there there was a
67:47 - little design and write and whatever
67:49 - yeah I think I think people get the idea
67:54 - so that's it for this video guys we
67:57 - really hope that you got something out
67:59 - of it I mean Aaron and I put a lot of
68:01 - work and effort into it but what's most
68:04 - important for you is to get something
68:08 - out of it you need to actually build
68:10 - something using this and you to build it
68:12 - right away because the the thing that
68:16 - people get stuck in the tutorial
68:18 - purgatory that often happens because
68:22 - people aren't taking the additional time
68:25 - to build things that's their own they're
68:29 - only following a tutorial and then they
68:31 - go okay I follow this tutorial but I
68:33 - still don't know how to use this
68:35 - and fridge we've all been there so you
68:38 - get stuck and to get unstuck you want to
68:41 - build your own projects you want to do
68:43 - your own things that's how you'll get
68:45 - better now in the description we'll try
68:47 - to link the source code for you so you
68:50 - can have access to it whenever you want
68:52 - and we really hope you enjoyed it so if
68:56 - you have enjoyed this so far and you're
68:59 - maybe interested in something like how
69:02 - can you actually freelance from coding
69:04 - how can you earn an income from coding
