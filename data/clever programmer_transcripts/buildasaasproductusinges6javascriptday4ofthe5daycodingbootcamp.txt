00:00 - jesse and today hi guys we are
00:03 - check this out guys we are building a
00:06 - sas product that's a jobs search
00:09 - application
00:10 - a job search product kind of like
00:12 - indeed.com but we've got our own version
00:15 - look at how good this one
00:16 - looks right you can go through you can
00:18 - apply right you can filter by different
00:20 - jobs
00:21 - if i go to for example front end and i
00:23 - just do a fine job i can filter for
00:24 - different jobs right here
00:26 - it is so good it's so useful assess
00:29 - product like this
00:30 - you know requires a lot what we're using
00:32 - here is we're using javascript of course
00:34 - i'm going to remove this
00:35 - we're using javascript of course we're
00:36 - using some nice uh
00:38 - you know uh animations and we're going
00:40 - to use a fetch request
00:42 - a like be able to fetch from the api so
00:44 - again
00:45 - so javascript so js you know we're going
00:48 - to learn
00:48 - fast today right we're also going to
00:50 - going to learn how to use animations
00:53 - right which is going to be a lot of fun
00:55 - and most people will just use
00:56 - how how to how to build a
01:00 - a useful a a user-friendly application
01:03 - randomly application free and the
01:05 - application
01:07 - application from from other
01:10 - from like from other inspirational uh
01:12 - from other inspirations i want to say
01:14 - right what i'm being what i mean by that
01:16 - by the way what do i mean by that jesse
01:18 - from other inspirations
01:19 - right so guys
01:23 - we were wanted to build something super
01:26 - cool for you right
01:27 - yeah so we found a few dashboards that
01:31 - really appeal to us
01:33 - however sometimes when you want to make
01:35 - your own application
01:36 - you don't want to either copy one thing
01:40 - but you want to combine certain things
01:42 - off those
01:43 - examples to get the best thing for you
01:46 - okay so that is what we've done
01:48 - um we had a few inspirations examples
01:51 - you want me to send you the links now or
01:53 - yeah i think i actually have them i
01:55 - think let me see if i can
01:56 - yeah i think yeah yeah so for example i
01:58 - think it's the last three some yeah
01:59 - so i haven't special so one inspiration
02:01 - came from this for example so you guys
02:03 - can see
02:03 - that this is a person here by nassim so
02:06 - he has a nice
02:07 - oh wait hold on let me show it to you
02:08 - guys right here so when i seen this
02:10 - explanation we took
02:11 - you guys how am i you see my shared
02:13 - screen yes right yeah
02:14 - yeah we do we do make sure yeah so for
02:17 - example
02:17 - literally for example we would literally
02:19 - go to like dribble so
02:21 - one really cool place you should check
02:22 - guys to check out something called
02:23 - dribble.com
02:25 - dripbb bble.com
02:28 - um if you want to go search for design
02:30 - inspirations
02:31 - so a lot of times i would go to that and
02:33 - be like oh this is so cool be cool to
02:34 - build something along the
02:36 - lines of this you know along the lines
02:38 - of this
02:39 - and so you can see just how it's not the
02:42 - same
02:42 - right but it takes certain parts from it
02:45 - right and i'm not necessarily stealing
02:46 - or anything i'm just using this as
02:48 - inspiration just like you know when you
02:50 - make a house or you build a house you're
02:52 - going to use other inspirations to build
02:53 - a house
02:53 - maybe you're painting something same
02:55 - situation here right so this is one good
02:57 - inspiration that we took away from
02:58 - another good special we took away from
02:59 - was actually something called
03:00 - uh from a mentor they have their own but
03:03 - by the way
03:04 - uh their own you guys should check out
03:06 - they also do designs for different
03:07 - projects
03:08 - right here and we took inspiration some
03:10 - from this from them as well
03:12 - and they're really nice they got a
03:13 - really nice design as well so if you
03:15 - guys ever want to check out
03:16 - uh them their really really cool uh
03:18 - website from 10mentor.com
03:20 - definitely the website is called friend
03:22 - from that mentor dot
03:24 - io make sure to check it out okay it is
03:27 - super cool website and you can learn so
03:30 - much when you browse through it okay
03:32 - yeah so we took expression from
03:33 - different from this as well you can see
03:34 - again
03:35 - we're not it's not exactly any in any
03:37 - way shape or form is the same but
03:39 - for example you know the layout of like
03:41 - the three column layout that was a good
03:43 - inspiration right for us right
03:45 - so things like that right so that was
03:47 - really really cool
03:48 - awesome so at this point guys that's
03:49 - pretty much it let's go and get started
03:51 - into our five-day coding bootcamp let's
03:52 - see what we've got so far
03:54 - i'm going to go ahead and present to all
03:55 - of you guys so you guys can see it
03:57 - that's great by the way guys i do want
03:58 - to add things like if you do
04:00 - use certain design from other designers
04:03 - that are really like
04:04 - explicitly visible that they're owned by
04:06 - them
04:07 - please make sure to give them credit
04:09 - okay because we all work together
04:11 - yes okay exactly don't exactly that's it
04:13 - it's time to focus
04:14 - let's get into it it's time you guys
04:16 - know the drill turn off your phones
04:17 - throw them throw them outside the window
04:19 - uh we're not liable for those phones if
04:20 - you do break them so i'm sorry about
04:22 - that
04:22 - but you know just you know just just
04:24 - keep keep in mind
04:26 - keep it q a guys as always
04:29 - after the build okay we have a q a ask

09:22 - so so cute so today guys we're
09:26 - building this exact this project right
09:28 - here we're going to build a
09:29 - dab a like a clever i call the clever
09:32 - jobs you guys can call whatever you want
09:35 - clever jobs for searching for jobs it's
09:38 - a really popular because
09:39 - you know this is think of it as like a
09:41 - sas product which is software as service
09:43 - a product
09:44 - which will basically you can something
09:46 - you usually sell a lot of times right
09:48 - um and the way this is really cool for
09:50 - us to build this because
09:51 - like i said you're going to learn a
09:52 - little different a lot of different
09:54 - techniques in terms of how we use
09:55 - javascript and how we put
09:57 - you know connect the javascript portion
09:59 - to the html portion
10:00 - you kind of saw part of it yesterday
10:02 - with the what's it called with um
10:05 - but today we're gonna go like even a
10:07 - little bit more crazy
10:09 - crazier so let's get started guys all
10:12 - right let's go ahead and get started
10:13 - right right away i'm gonna put my little
10:16 - code
10:16 - cheat sheet here at the bottom
10:20 - and yes if you're wondering do i have a
10:21 - cheat sheet yes i do of course
10:25 - yes i do have a cheat sheet just to make
10:29 - sure if everything if everything if
10:30 - everything goes wrong i can i can
10:32 - you know look back on this one so
10:36 - let's see okay so here's what we got
10:39 - you guys know the drill this point let's
10:41 - go ahead and create a new folder
10:42 - uh as you can see i have a new folder
10:44 - already created but let's go ahead and
10:46 - new finder
10:47 - you'll find your window right there so
10:49 - go to your projects folder you guys know
10:51 - the drill at that point
10:52 - products folder i have a five-day
10:54 - bootcamp and then right-click new folder
10:56 - let's call it
10:57 - live developer jobs live dash developer
11:01 - developer dash jobs okay let me know you
11:03 - guys got this portion so live dash
11:05 - developer dash jobs okay
11:07 - create that one and then what you want
11:09 - to do at this point is fi
11:10 - do file open so do file open on your vs
11:13 - code and
11:14 - open up the live developer jobs folder
11:17 - right just click on the folders for
11:18 - example if i go to file day bootcamp i
11:20 - will click on the live developer jobs
11:22 - folder and then you should be able to
11:23 - open it from that does that make sense
11:26 - comprende you guys still with me let me
11:28 - know give me a thumbs up when you guys
11:30 - got to that portion you guys opened up
11:31 - the folder right give me a thumbs up
11:33 - here
11:35 - give me a thumbs up here yeah got it got
11:37 - it got it got it got it beautiful that's
11:39 - what i'm talking about i love that port
11:41 - okay sweet sweet sweet good good good
11:42 - good good
11:43 - so that's all good that's all good all
11:46 - right
11:46 - all right awesome so at this point
11:48 - here's what our folder looks like it's
11:50 - pretty much
11:51 - empty of course right now let me ask
11:53 - this question what do you guys think is
11:54 - the first thing we need to do
11:56 - to make this work what do you guys think
11:58 - what is it what is the first thing we
11:59 - need to do to make this work
12:00 - right let me blame the chat oh very good
12:03 - peter says and rudy megan all say
12:07 - index.html yeah exactly so let's create
12:09 - our index.html so file new file we'll do
12:14 - index.html
12:15 - okay of course and you guys know this
12:17 - point to create the boilerplate
12:19 - to create the boilerplate of any html
12:22 - right right what we do is we do
12:25 - exclamation point and see this gives us
12:27 - a suggestion and i'm an abbreviation
12:29 - right here
12:30 - and all i do is simply just hit enter
12:32 - boom right there look at that
12:34 - and then right away it gives me what i
12:35 - want you see that pretty pretty cool
12:36 - right
12:37 - pretty cool exactly hello
12:40 - and this is jesse right there hi jessie
12:44 - so hi okay awesome so we got the
12:46 - innovation map what's the next thing
12:47 - guys we should do
12:49 - what's the next thing we should do right
12:51 - what's the next should we do
12:53 - let me say word wrap please it's really
12:54 - hard to do wardrobe on this one guys
12:56 - um this we don't really don't
12:58 - necessarily need that portion guys for
13:00 - the water wrap because
13:01 - this is just meta stuff so don't worry
13:02 - about this so much okay i mean like
13:04 - i mean i don't know do i do view or it
13:06 - doesn't allow me to do work you see guys
13:08 - i really i literally cannot do word wrap
13:10 - look at this see it won't allow me so
13:12 - i'm sorry about that um
13:14 - so cool then let's go create a new
13:16 - folder and we'll create a css folder and
13:20 - then
13:20 - that's the new also let's create a new
13:22 - folder after that create new folder
13:23 - let's call it
13:24 - js right so two folders right
13:28 - inside a css folder let's go ahead and
13:30 - right click and select new file and
13:32 - let's create a
13:32 - style let's see assess file right so we
13:35 - have a css file
13:36 - you guys know the drill at this point
13:38 - okay and then at this point let's go
13:40 - ahead
13:40 - and link up this file how do you know
13:43 - how do we link the css file you guys
13:45 - know that yes or no
13:47 - you guys know that yes or no how do we
13:48 - link up the css file
13:51 - yeah good so link rel correct jesse
13:54 - link real style sheet right there good
13:58 - href href is the link uh the link where
14:01 - it's going to be continue on
14:04 - and by the way nice can you share the
14:07 - shirt the server with me
14:09 - okay let me see hopefully i can
14:12 - i'm gonna start a live stream that's why
14:15 - so guys
14:16 - when you link it up of course we're
14:18 - going to refer to
14:19 - the css folder not just made and then
14:22 - to the file name style.css that's right
14:25 - so that's right
14:27 - that's it easy-peasy let lemon squeezy
14:30 - [Music]
14:31 - yes for sure so guys if we look at the
14:34 - app like we always talk about in the
14:37 - last few days right we divide things up
14:39 - in boxes
14:41 - so what are some what are some boxes we
14:44 - got
14:44 - yes what do you think of sometimes we
14:46 - got so let me go ahead and show it out
14:48 - for you guys
14:49 - okay right always when we do things we
14:51 - do into boxes so what are some boxes
14:53 - what do we got
14:54 - what do we got guys anybody have it yeah
14:56 - we got the search bar right so we got
14:58 - the header right here okay we got this
15:01 - header right here okay what else do we
15:02 - got guys what else we have
15:04 - search bar the search bar that's right
15:07 - that's like
15:08 - albert that's right so a search bar
15:10 - right here that's correct
15:12 - right what else we got oh hector very
15:15 - good
15:16 - main area with a grid yes right so this
15:19 - main area
15:20 - this whole main area that's the one
15:23 - that's gonna have that grid right
15:24 - so right whenever you see a collection
15:27 - of things
15:28 - you kind of group them together remember
15:29 - that whenever you see a collection of
15:31 - things you group
15:32 - them together okay group them together
15:35 - so in our case for example here right we
15:37 - have a css grid
15:39 - and that's going to be grouped together
15:40 - we also have this little showing 25
15:43 - jobs portion and then now at this point
15:46 - we have the css grid that's
15:48 - all of this correct yes or no right like
15:50 - that
15:51 - just like that and that's it so now we
15:54 - divide our application into
15:55 - multiple multiple things and at this
15:57 - point all we gotta do is just you know
15:58 - type them up so let's do that
16:00 - so the first thing we did is we're going
16:02 - to create the header dot
16:03 - the header dot uh the header actually so
16:06 - let's go ahead and create the header
16:06 - jesse
16:08 - yes so guys you can just say this
16:11 - header and then inside of it oop
16:14 - can you guys see is that is that a big
16:16 - enough font or do you guys want to make
16:17 - it bigger is that big enough
16:18 - for you guys give a thumbs up if it is
16:19 - good or you guys want to see
16:21 - more a little bigger somebody said
16:26 - yeah bigger please okay a little bit
16:28 - bigger a little bit bigger how about
16:29 - that is that better
16:30 - good yes nice okay okay
16:34 - awesome okay go ahead jesse noel and you
16:38 - know
16:38 - like we said right if you draw the
16:40 - header there are certain things inside
16:42 - of that header
16:44 - so i would say um
16:47 - let's make a header container okay this
16:49 - class right but why why
16:51 - because here's the thing right if we
16:53 - have this specific header right think
16:55 - about like this
16:56 - if we have this header right here this
16:58 - whole thing is a whole header right
17:01 - that you see how this clever jobs is in
17:03 - the left-hand portion
17:04 - the way i can imagine it is kind of like
17:06 - this
17:08 - you have a header container right here
17:10 - that prevents it from going
17:12 - bigger that makes it centered you see
17:14 - that yeah it's correct correct correct
17:16 - j j j wait what is it called j lord yeah
17:20 - correct mag with a max width that's
17:22 - right that's right
17:23 - so let's go ahead and make that happen
17:25 - good job jesse
17:27 - um and i know it has
17:30 - two things what is inside of that header
17:33 - we have a logo so let's go to create a
17:35 - div class is equal to oh dang jesse's
17:38 - just gonna oh
17:40 - sorry all right okay go ahead jesse
17:43 - sarinas okay
17:46 - and then we have a the text clever jobs
17:49 - right here you see that guys
17:51 - a text clever job so let's go ahead and
17:52 - make that work that one work
17:54 - right so this this logo is gonna be this
17:57 - one
17:58 - right that's the logo right and then the
18:00 - clever jobs right
18:02 - that's going to be what that's going to
18:03 - be what that's going to be
18:05 - this span right here i know you guys
18:07 - probably can see that the spin
18:09 - oh dang jesse what's going on there's
18:13 - i don't know
18:14 - [Laughter]
18:16 - clever i can't type today so then
18:20 - what do we have at this point is we have
18:21 - an image so then we have
18:23 - so the logo is going to be the image is
18:25 - going to be where guys
18:26 - inside what
18:29 - inside the logo class correct right yeah
18:32 - exactly
18:33 - inside the logo class so let's go ahead
18:34 - and do image source
18:37 - is equal to what all right is equal to
18:39 - something which we have no idea what it
18:41 - is
18:41 - but we can actually grab a logo from our
18:45 - cloud program logo so i'm going to go to
18:47 - new tab and i'm going to say clever
18:48 - program right here
18:49 - oh not clapper.com but clever programmer
18:51 - here
18:54 - grab a programmer and literally the the
18:56 - way to grab the logo is very simple i go
18:57 - to images at this point
18:59 - and i just look we have the logos the
19:01 - first one
19:03 - this one knows this one this one right
19:06 - here
19:06 - so copy and adjust i copy link uh image
19:10 - address on this one and i will paste it
19:11 - for you guys to see all of you guys to
19:13 - see okay
19:15 - let's see aaron you're gonna paste it
19:16 - are you gonna paste it i got it yep
19:18 - right here
19:19 - that's the logo address okay those are
19:22 - here on youtube you guys know where to
19:24 - go at this point
19:25 - so and then do image source and then
19:26 - paste the link inside the image source
19:28 - guys okay
19:30 - so the image stores boom donezo
19:35 - nice so couple of stuff okay
19:39 - let's see what we have all right so now
19:41 - we've got all this html you guys still
19:43 - with me yes or no guys got it oh bueno
19:45 - give me a cheeky picky all right all
19:48 - right
19:48 - so now if i go ahead and right click on
19:50 - the index.html and
19:52 - all of you at this point bueno cheeky
19:54 - picky
19:55 - that's nice at this point go open with
19:58 - live server like this
20:00 - and you guys should have live server
20:02 - already installed
20:03 - okay and boom we have
20:07 - just a humongous clever program logo
20:09 - which is fine
20:10 - right which is fine you okay jesse yeah
20:13 - yeah
20:14 - i'm just closing the header container
20:18 - i just see like the div
20:22 - right so now now let's work on the
20:24 - header portion right so we have this
20:25 - header okay let's look at the css for
20:27 - this header
20:28 - so if i go to style.css right here okay
20:32 - if i go to style the css let's work on
20:34 - the header so i'm going to say header
20:35 - here
20:37 - okay and what is inside the header well
20:40 - number one
20:40 - is we need to change the background
20:42 - color of this header guys that's number
20:43 - one right so if i go ahead and go to
20:45 - header
20:46 - let's do background background
20:51 - all this header is going to be what
20:52 - jesse well it's going to be this color
20:55 - and it's like a sort of black
20:59 - it's black blue kind of color it's like
21:01 - grayish color it's like a gray color
21:02 - okay put it in zoom chat everybody so
21:05 - now you can see that
21:06 - how this hair just kind of became like
21:08 - the way it is right now and you can see
21:10 - right here how
21:11 - everybody see these little borders right
21:13 - here anybody see this borders you guys
21:14 - see it give me a thumbs up if you guys
21:15 - do see it yeah
21:16 - you see those borders right well the
21:18 - reason why is because
21:19 - by default body the whole body has a
21:21 - margin so here's what we do
21:23 - i go to body like this and i say margin
21:28 - zero
21:30 - boom you see now it's gone right now
21:32 - that's gone that's correct yes yes yes
21:34 - yes that's correct
21:35 - and what i also can do is let's also do
21:37 - a
21:38 - box sizing so i'm going to say the
21:39 - following let's say
21:41 - like this i'm going to say box sizing i
21:44 - know that for sure now
21:45 - box size and we'll do border blocks for
21:47 - this one for your box
21:49 - guys who can't explain what box sizing
21:53 - barter box
21:54 - does by now in the chat who can explain
21:57 - it in one sentence i want to see
21:59 - okay continue on i don't think i can
22:01 - explain it one second honestly
22:07 - that's okay that's okay so look now
22:09 - let's go ahead and do a font family so
22:11 - i'm going to change the font for this
22:12 - whole thing so font family it's going to
22:14 - be this one and i'm going to put it for
22:16 - you guys in the chat as well so find
22:17 - family right here
22:19 - boom find family okay
22:22 - so margin zero fun family and let's give
22:26 - the text color should be all be white so
22:28 - color
22:29 - color white right so that means so we're
22:32 - gonna give the body
22:34 - everything the color should be white
22:35 - because like i said we're doing like a
22:36 - gray scale type situation it's a dark
22:38 - mode
22:39 - application okay awesome so we got that
22:42 - now let's work with the header so now if
22:44 - we think about the header okay
22:46 - right the header has a height yes or no
22:49 - you see this height
22:50 - how big is this height how big is this
22:52 - height it's not that big right
22:54 - so i'm gonna give this a height of
22:56 - around
22:58 - 70 pixels okay
23:02 - by the way i do want to set the
23:03 - background of the body i think
23:05 - okay let's do that that's fine yeah it's
23:08 - this
23:08 - darker color okay it's darker than
23:12 - the header yeah so you see you see the
23:14 - header
23:16 - is a little bit less grayish it's a
23:18 - little more gray you see you see that
23:20 - gas yes or no
23:21 - it's a little more really hard to see
23:22 - but yeah you can see it
23:24 - okay awesome okay a little more grayish
23:27 - okay now for the height we did 70 pixels
23:29 - so you can see the header right there
23:31 - okay
23:31 - as well uh let's at the same time what
23:34 - we need to do
23:34 - is the fall is we need to do this right
23:37 - we need to
23:38 - this image is way too large and there's
23:40 - a lot of stuff going on here like this
23:41 - image is way too big so well here's
23:43 - something to do
23:44 - let's display flex on everything
23:47 - because that's always the answer if if
23:50 - you if you have life troubles
23:51 - just play flex them flex it fix it baby
23:55 - fix it break it not forget it whatever
23:57 - [Laughter]
24:00 - all right okay after that we're gonna
24:03 - center so let's go ahead and save this
24:04 - good next thing we're going to center
24:06 - everything so i'm going to do display
24:07 - flex i'm going to justify content
24:10 - actually i'm going to do align
24:15 - oh yeah just yeah that's right yeah so
24:18 - the display flex
24:20 - and let's do
24:24 - well first of all now it depends where
24:26 - do you want to have the logo
24:27 - and the text do you want it on the left
24:30 - side do you want to do the middle or do
24:32 - you want it on the right side
24:33 - that's right so actually here's what we
24:36 - want you to do because we have this
24:37 - header container guys right
24:39 - is we actually need to modify this
24:40 - header container to be in the center
24:44 - yeah that's right right so right this
24:46 - header container is what's actually
24:48 - encapsulating
24:49 - everything between the clever jobs and
24:50 - all this kind of stuff right
24:52 - so yeah go to style the css and we'll do
24:55 - that header container
24:58 - dash container right and what's inside
25:02 - here jesse
25:04 - um well i would first i'm gonna give it
25:07 - a color
25:08 - to make it visible okay otherwise we
25:10 - don't see it what's inside of it
25:12 - okay oh it's pink let's go pink okay
25:16 - and now now we're going to go back to
25:18 - header
25:19 - and we're going to centralize this
25:21 - header container
25:22 - because the header container is inside
25:24 - of the header guys got it right that's
25:25 - right
25:26 - so justify content
25:30 - center good
25:34 - now and then we do save it save it yes
25:37 - beautiful but also let's do online items
25:39 - in it to make sure it's all in the
25:40 - center
25:41 - vertically as well so align item center
25:43 - sorry
25:45 - a line items center
25:49 - right there okay oh oh dang that
25:52 - looks horrible
25:54 - that's all and let's let's make that
25:55 - image maybe smaller what do you think
25:58 - now i think so jesse too yeah
26:00 - yeah so how do we do that guys how do
26:02 - how do you think we make the image
26:03 - smaller guys what do you guys think
26:05 - how do we make the image smaller guys
26:08 - what do you guys think huh
26:09 - what do you guys think put it in chat
26:11 - yeah exactly yeah height well i don't
26:13 - that's right so if you know the image is
26:16 - actually wrapped inside the logo
26:18 - so actually we need to make the logo div
26:21 - smaller and then the image will decrease
26:23 - in size as well
26:24 - see so yeah here's how we're going to
26:26 - make it we're going to create a how to
26:27 - continue logo we're going to stylize
26:29 - this one and we're going to give this
26:30 - one a height of 30 pixels okay
26:33 - like this okay that's right and then
26:35 - what's going to happen is
26:36 - because i had a 30 pixel so if i say
26:37 - this i can see nothing really changes
26:39 - this point still which is fine which is
26:41 - totally fine
26:42 - but if i tell my the height of my image
26:45 - to be a hundred percent it's going to be
26:48 - a hundred percent of what
26:50 - what do you guys know a height of a
26:52 - hundred percent of what if the period is
26:53 - 30 pixels
26:55 - that's right henry the wrapper right the
26:57 - wrapper the parent element
26:59 - so boom right there you see so now the
27:00 - clever pokemon is only
27:02 - 30 pixels that's pretty much it right
27:04 - also in how to continue you see how the
27:06 - clever
27:06 - clever jobs is right here up on the
27:09 - bottom instead of on the right hand side
27:11 - well what do we do with that for the
27:13 - header container
27:14 - we also go ahead you see yeah we have to
27:18 - give the header container first of all i
27:19 - would give it the max
27:20 - width oh
27:23 - right 1250 pixel
27:28 - save that right but we also need to but
27:31 - this is a max width
27:32 - going to tell us how to continue to do a
27:34 - width of 100
27:35 - right because then it maxes out correct
27:39 - correcto and then guys of course
27:44 - there we go you see it now that's max
27:47 - width of 1250. you see that right there
27:49 - mixed with a 12 thick see 50.
27:53 - how the hell did that come about i don't
27:55 - know
27:56 - so guys now boom did you see that i'm
27:59 - gonna do a display flex and now the logo
28:02 - and the text are next to each other
28:04 - instead of
28:06 - that's right vertically aligned that's
28:07 - right that's right
28:09 - and i'm gonna give it i want them you
28:11 - can't see it right now but you
28:13 - gonna have to pay really good attention
28:15 - i'm going to center
28:16 - it on the align items so if you
28:19 - save it now it will line vertically you
28:22 - see it will go to the
28:23 - see the text will go to the middle of
28:26 - the header
28:27 - you see that um exactly maybe you can
28:29 - spin a little bit on the
28:31 - side remove the pink jesse remove the
28:33 - pink boom right there see
28:35 - it's lovely it's lovely it is i agree i
28:38 - just wanted to see the actual centered
28:40 - right right right right plus what else
28:42 - do we see guys the logo
28:46 - is stuck to the text that's right that's
28:50 - right we would like it
28:51 - all circumstances we would like them to
28:53 - have a little bit of distance okay
28:55 - so on the head on the logo class i'm
28:58 - going to say
28:58 - margin right and i'm going to give it
29:01 - like a little bit let's
29:02 - see and so that's going to go ahead and
29:05 - actually
29:06 - push the clever jobs to the right-hand
29:07 - side so do that jesse let's go
29:09 - save that boom right there also at this
29:12 - point you see that the font size is way
29:13 - too small so how can we fix that very
29:15 - simple guys well how do we fix that guys
29:16 - what do you guys think huh
29:18 - how do we fix that well all we do is we
29:20 - just make the fonts as bigger so we go
29:21 - to the header
29:23 - right here and we do font size for this
29:25 - one font size what is the font
29:26 - this one font size 20 pixels i was going
29:29 - to save that boom you see that's a lot
29:30 - better which is really really good okay
29:33 - awesome at this point that's pretty
29:35 - pretty pretty much it on the header
29:37 - container
29:37 - the header is there i kind of like it
29:40 - it's kind of pretty good
29:42 - now let's work on the next one guys look
29:43 - at this the header is done
29:46 - of course there's some spacing right
29:47 - here to fix later on you see how it's
29:49 - all in the corner which i don't like
29:51 - but if i make this bigger here's a cool
29:53 - thing you see it kind of stays there
29:55 - you see that oh look at that guys
29:58 - because that's the header container
30:00 - inside of the header that's right that's
30:02 - right that's what i'm trying to
30:03 - i'm trying to think is like this logo is
30:06 - it really in the center of everything
30:07 - yeah i think it is right jesse yeah it's
30:09 - a line it has a line item center that's
30:11 - right that's right so i'm making sure
30:13 - yeah so i think so yeah okay
30:14 - for sure for sure cool so that's all
30:16 - good next up let's work on the next
30:18 - thing which is gonna be this search box
30:19 - okay
30:20 - now this search box is going to be
30:23 - really really interesting let's go back
30:24 - to
30:25 - our index.html here guys are you guys
30:28 - still with me
30:29 - you guys still with me kind of guys put
30:31 - it in the chat if you're coding with us
30:33 - okay beautiful beautiful yes yes yes yes
30:37 - yes i like it
30:38 - now we're going pretty fast by us but
30:39 - that's okay that's okay it's okay
30:41 - it's okay so now let's go and create our
30:44 - next one is gonna be this
30:45 - this whole div search i'm gonna call
30:48 - this
30:49 - div div div
30:52 - is going to be class is equal to search
30:55 - okay boom you have class search okay so
30:59 - nothing inside here just yet right this
31:01 - div cluster
31:02 - is going to be so it's going to be just
31:04 - imagine like an empty
31:06 - type situation right inside that we're
31:08 - going to also create a div class search
31:10 - container
31:11 - because why this whole thing
31:14 - you see is the width is kind of within
31:18 - the search right so if i think about it
31:22 - this is right here will be search div
31:24 - and then
31:25 - this would be the search container right
31:29 - just like with the header mm-hmm that's
31:32 - it
31:32 - that's it you see that right there
31:35 - awesome so let's do div class is equal
31:38 - to
31:39 - search container dash container
31:44 - boom search container awesome okay let's
31:46 - go and save that one
31:49 - okay and inside this div a few things
31:52 - we're going to
31:52 - need to do okay so the first things
31:54 - first is we have of course
31:56 - you can see that we have like this
31:58 - portion
32:01 - and then this portion this is a button
32:04 - yeah and then this is like a icon with
32:06 - an input
32:07 - you see what i mean so what i'm going to
32:09 - do with this one is i'm going to say
32:12 - a div class is equal to
32:15 - input container right
32:18 - because that's going to contain the
32:19 - input with the search icon okay
32:22 - okay right there and then after that
32:25 - it's going to be
32:25 - also d of class
32:30 - is equal to what a button container
32:36 - so wants to be the input container so if
32:38 - we think about in terms of logic
32:40 - boom this is right here is the input
32:42 - container right here
32:44 - this one is gonna be the button
32:45 - container guys okay
32:47 - does that make sense right
32:50 - and that's pretty pretty much it okay
32:52 - awesome so guys
32:53 - what do we have in the input container
32:57 - what do you guys think put in the chat
32:59 - guys
33:01 - what are we on the input container icon
33:04 - we have an icon
33:05 - icon and what
33:08 - field yes good good good good good so we
33:11 - have the icon and the field so now
33:14 - for the icon how do we use the icon well
33:16 - again
33:17 - let's go to font awesome just how did
33:19 - the last time
33:21 - go to font awesome uh-huh i know pretty
33:24 - cool huh

33:32 - right so font awesome
33:33 - cool let's type in search search
33:37 - okay and you can see that this right
33:39 - here right away
33:40 - has a search icon so we'll have the
33:42 - search icon right here
33:44 - search icon go go good
33:48 - let's click search icon and there right
33:50 - away gives us the html for the search
33:52 - icon so i'm going to copy this i'm going
33:54 - to click on this one
33:56 - i'm going to copy and paste it into our
33:58 - input container
34:01 - comprende comprende
34:05 - got it got it got it got it got it
34:06 - awesome so we got that portion that's
34:09 - awesome
34:10 - and then of course but nothing's gonna
34:11 - work really because we need to import
34:13 - font awesome into our application
34:15 - so for you i've got the style sheet for
34:18 - the font awesome for you just for you
34:19 - guys

42:02 - you see how this is right next to the
42:03 - header you see it right there
42:05 - let's make let's push it all the way
42:06 - down so what we do is we go
42:08 - here we go to the header portion and we
42:11 - say
42:12 - margin bottom we literally just say
42:14 - margin bottom header
42:16 - we say margin dash bottom
42:21 - bottom and we just say 25 pixels 25
42:25 - yeah i think there you go see how pixels
42:27 - and then we do the following
42:28 - you see how this clever jobs is can this
42:30 - logo is kind of
42:31 - the left hand side of it i don't like
42:33 - that let's give this header container a
42:35 - padding
42:37 - padding of 0
42:42 - 25 pixels so guys what does that mean
42:46 - top and bottom zero pixel left and right
42:49 - 25 pixels got it i hope hector did
42:52 - did the move with that nice okay so now
42:56 - you see it's starting to look really
42:57 - really good okay i like that now let's
42:59 - go ahead and how do we go ahead right
43:02 - now the issue is this fine job and this
43:04 - kind of stuff it's all great
43:06 - but they're all on top of each other
43:08 - what do we need to do to make it happen
43:09 - from left to right you guys know the
43:10 - number drill
43:14 - like i said baby i should have like i
43:16 - shot like a button for flex
43:18 - instead of instead of the song i like to
43:20 - move it move it we should do it with
43:22 - flex it you know
43:23 - i know right that's funny so let's go to
43:26 - search containers you display flex on
43:27 - this one
43:29 - good good good so if we save that see
43:32 - now it's a little bit different so find
43:33 - job is right here okay good
43:35 - next up here's a question for you
43:38 - okay the search container is all flexed
43:41 - which is great
43:42 - right it's all flex and everything looks
43:44 - is looking looking
43:45 - all pretty good but here's my
43:49 - issue with this now at this point guys
43:50 - okay here's my issue at this point
43:53 - we need to go ahead and make it in a way
43:56 - where this
43:56 - fine job is actually all the way on the
43:58 - right hand side
44:00 - what needs to happen in order to make
44:02 - that portion
44:03 - work what do you guys think just curious
44:08 - what used to happen guys what do you
44:10 - guys think people say space between
44:13 - space around justify content space
44:15 - between
44:16 - justify content flex and
44:20 - so good so it's pretty pretty good but
44:22 - actually we're gonna do a little bit
44:23 - differently guys check this out because
44:26 - the way we're doing it maybe it's not
44:27 - non-conventional i mean it's kind of
44:29 - conventional but also not unconventional
44:31 - so first things first is the way i will
44:34 - do it is
44:35 - i will go to my um input container look
44:38 - at this
44:40 - actually no i can do it like this
44:41 - display flex
44:43 - and you see how there is an input
44:45 - container and there is
44:46 - a what a button container so if i go to
44:50 - my input container
44:51 - if i do here if i say input container
44:54 - check this out
44:55 - container right here and i say flex
44:59 - grow one
45:03 - boom right there what just happened look
45:05 - at that what just happened
45:07 - yeah oh basically so if i go ahead and
45:11 - do background color of this one let's
45:12 - just zoom back and color this one
45:14 - i just wanted to do the exact same pink
45:17 - pink oh you did pink
45:18 - right there see right there purple you
45:20 - say purple
45:21 - adrian so you see it makes
45:24 - everything push guys
45:28 - see with flex grow one
45:32 - it pushes the price of whiskey it's
45:33 - saying hey you know what grow this div
45:36 - as much as you possibly can it's like
45:38 - stretch this
45:39 - this thing out as much as you can that's
45:42 - literally what's happening here
45:43 - you see that guys that's the cool part
45:45 - about flexnet
45:48 - flex sorry i gotta do this that was
45:50 - funny let's grow one
45:53 - yeah exactly right so it will grow up on
45:56 - the spills it has available
45:58 - exactly so that's good okay at this
46:00 - point let's go also now go let's go
46:01 - ahead and center this uh horizontally
46:03 - or vertically right so let's in the
46:05 - input container let's do display flex on
46:06 - this one
46:08 - right and how do we center horizontally
46:10 - and vertically what do we do guys
46:12 - what do we do so we'll do justify
46:14 - content
46:16 - center good and then we do what align
46:18 - items
46:21 - center yeah we actually do not need
46:24 - justify content center because we needed
46:26 - to be on the left-hand side so never
46:27 - mind this one
46:28 - yeah okay but it is aligned okay good
46:31 - awesome next thing this search box
46:35 - here's the issue this search box is
46:37 - large
46:39 - yeah it's a large search box
46:42 - so to make this one happen what do you
46:45 - think is to happen here
46:48 - what do you think well i think the i
46:52 - like what you said you know like
46:53 - the input container
46:56 - that one is this that one is this part
46:59 - which is good
46:59 - right good right that's fine so that's
47:02 - working that's
47:03 - good right right so i think we need to
47:07 - target the input inside of that
47:09 - that's right so input container input
47:13 - let's stretch this input now all the way
47:15 - out to here
47:16 - right so if we do flags grow one
47:19 - check this out check this out hey
47:22 - you see it just stretched the whole
47:24 - thing out
47:26 - right that's cool that's cool right so
47:29 - now that's awesome okay now with that
47:32 - being said
47:33 - let's go ahead and modify this container
47:34 - to make it look fancy
47:37 - because as white is now good no bueno
47:41 - so i don't want to have a background
47:43 - color anymore so i'm going to give it
47:44 - background color and i'm going to make
47:46 - it transparent
47:46 - yeah because by default the input has a
47:49 - see
47:50 - but the fold input has a white
47:51 - background color by default okay
47:53 - by default right go ahead jesse
47:56 - also that outline is pretty ugly
48:00 - so what i'm talking about by the way
48:02 - don't don't don't say it just yet
48:04 - the album i'm talking about is actually
48:06 - this one check this out guys
48:08 - one you see this outline it's a pretty
48:11 - horrible outline wouldn't you agree with
48:12 - me on that one
48:13 - this whole outline that's white right
48:15 - that's yeah
48:17 - yeah oh yeah yeah yeah so what do we do
48:20 - we say we say border none
48:24 - to remove the border like this see
48:28 - the border yeah that one yeah yeah yeah
48:29 - but then the outline when i focus on
48:31 - this it still has an outline so i'll
48:33 - also do outline none also as well
48:36 - nice save that beautiful oh my bad
48:40 - save that right here beautiful that one
48:43 - okay good
48:44 - next up let's go ahead and do a color
48:46 - white to make sure the text is white
48:48 - colored
48:50 - right there so see now when i type you
48:53 - see it's a white color now okay
48:55 - let's get a font size jesse yeah
48:59 - and i don't like how it touches the left
49:01 - side
49:02 - i'm going to give it also a padding or
49:04 - margin
49:05 - oh sorry a margin because i don't want
49:07 - that thing to grow bigger i just wanted
49:09 - to push
49:14 - oh what do we do
49:17 - there we go title okay awesome next up
49:20 - let's go ahead and see now it's time to
49:22 - look good look at this right here right
49:23 - it's done look
49:23 - really really good okay i like that
49:25 - awesome sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet
49:27 - that's pretty cool next thing let's go
49:28 - ahead and modify this uh
49:30 - icon so how do we modify the icon who
49:32 - knows guys
49:35 - what do we do with the icon guys anybody
49:37 - know what do we do the icon
49:41 - we target the icon so we'll say input
49:42 - container
49:44 - input container dash container container
49:48 - container we say icon for icon and we
49:50 - see font size in this icon right here so
49:53 - we say
49:53 - font size font size
49:57 - 20 pixels boom so we make it a little
50:01 - larger
50:01 - let's also put a small padding
50:04 - around this whole what's it called this
50:07 - whole um
50:09 - what is it this whole input container i
50:12 - so let's do
50:13 - margin left
50:16 - 25 pixels
50:19 - boom look at that oh
50:23 - that's how you can change the style of
50:25 - that icon
50:26 - good see so the icon the reason why we
50:29 - say font size for the icon because these
50:31 - icons are actually
50:32 - actually text they're not images the
50:35 - text
50:36 - that's the weird part about it i know
50:37 - you're like what no trust me
50:40 - cool i love that i love that sort of
50:42 - stuff yeah
50:44 - so cool uh so we got that let's go now

50:49 - point okay
50:51 - guitar yeah so boutonn has what
50:55 - a button container okay and then
50:58 - inside of that button container we have
51:00 - the span
51:01 - so we're first gonna like nas is doing
51:03 - we're first gonna target the button
51:06 - container
51:08 - that's it for now and we'll do a
51:10 - background color right on this one
51:11 - correct
51:13 - and the background go ahead jesse nice
51:16 - royal blue color blue
51:19 - nice i like it okay
51:23 - but i think it's a little bit small so
51:25 - i'm gonna make the width a little bit
51:26 - bigger
51:27 - good okay
51:30 - boom it should change nice
51:34 - yes right there okay and of course i'm
51:37 - gonna use this

57:06 - ahead and do that now you can see how
57:08 - this find job button right now okay
57:10 - you can see how this fine job button
57:12 - right now does not have a curvature why
57:14 - do you guys think like that why do you
57:15 - think
57:16 - this find your button does not is not
57:17 - curved what do you think is the case
57:19 - you see this is curved right here but
57:22 - this is not for some reason
57:24 - why is that the case no not the border
57:27 - rays because the border rays you already
57:29 - have we have this border base right here
57:31 - right
57:31 - but it's actually be closed because this
57:35 - button is overflowing the actual
57:39 - parent so what we need to do is go to
57:42 - style of css
57:43 - and on where we have the border race
57:46 - which is right here
57:47 - all we say is the following we say
57:50 - overflow hidden
57:54 - oh wow overflow hidden guys
57:58 - okay and there you go there you go
58:02 - that's it right so now this fine job has
58:04 - a clear curvature
58:06 - and this is a curvature at this point
58:08 - that's pretty much it we've got
58:09 - ourselves
58:10 - look at this that's that's it right
58:11 - jesse that's pretty fast that's pretty
58:13 - good
58:13 - that's pretty quick awesome sweet did
58:16 - you tell them why by the way
58:17 - there's a monophonic um no i haven't
58:21 - yet i thought you were going to change
58:22 - the ad event but i'll tell him no please
58:24 - tell him again because
58:25 - i told him but he's not responding okay
58:28 - so
58:28 - at this point guys let's go ahead and do
58:30 - the fall so i'm just going to clean this
58:31 - portion up
58:36 - clean this portion up and then so the
58:39 - following now is going to happen now we
58:40 - got this
58:41 - we got this filter by title we've got
58:43 - all this section let's now
58:45 - work on well here's the thing i kind of
58:48 - want to go into a little bit into a
58:49 - little bit of javascript guys at this
58:51 - point okay into a little bit of
58:52 - javascript because here's the thing
58:54 - we need to be able to catch this text so
58:57 - if i type something in here am i right
58:59 - if i type something in here we should be
59:02 - able to catch whatever we typed
59:04 - we should be able to catch whatever we
59:06 - typed okay so
59:08 - for example now okay
59:11 - if i go to my file and i have my
59:14 - javascript folder
59:15 - i create a new file and i'm going to say
59:17 - script
59:19 - dot js
59:22 - script.js okay
59:25 - let's get the gs and then this one
59:27 - what's going to happen at this point
59:29 - is we're going to create a what are we
59:32 - thinking to do
59:33 - in order to one catch this text what i
59:36 - think has me to do guys what do you guys
59:38 - think
59:41 - what do you guys think guys
59:46 - event list you're right we need to add
59:48 - an event listener
59:50 - right here actually on the find job
59:52 - button so whenever we click on it
59:54 - right we need to add a click email list
59:56 - on the click so for example let's say
59:57 - first we're going to do what let's do an
60:00 - event listener on the click of that to
60:02 - find jobs
60:03 - okay so i'm going to say like this
60:05 - document
60:08 - do like this document dot query selector
60:14 - query selector and what do we what do
60:17 - you guys think we'll get
60:18 - well let's go to any html and
60:21 - what are we clicking on the button
60:23 - container
60:25 - that's right the button container right
60:28 - so let's
60:28 - go ahead and copy copy the button
60:30 - container
60:33 - button container let's do dot a button
60:35 - container
60:37 - okay diablo because this is a class
60:39 - right we'll select this one
60:40 - and we'll do what dot add
60:44 - event listener anyway
60:48 - we'll do a click event listener on this
60:49 - one
60:51 - okay boom boom boom right there
60:54 - okay click my list on this one and then
60:57 - we save that so let's do
60:58 - console.log log
61:03 - i once clicked
61:06 - okay i was
61:10 - clicked okay awesome sweet sweet sweet
61:13 - uh jessica in that case tell david
61:15 - please because i think i'm out of his
61:16 - life okay
61:17 - okay thank you so i was clicked okay so
61:20 - if i go ahead and if i
61:22 - click find a job let me see if i'll
61:24 - inspect them on this one
61:27 - let me see and i do console
61:30 - if i click on this let me see where's my
61:32 - console here
61:35 - let me scroll all the way down let me
61:36 - put this at the bottom of our page
61:39 - now nothing is happening and why is that
61:41 - the case
61:43 - yeah that's right colin that's right uh
61:46 - wait
61:46 - call font yeah that's right so we need
61:48 - to add this our script
61:49 - to actually in this html so for example
61:52 - here we have the link
61:53 - to our css but we have no link to our
61:55 - javascript file
61:57 - so that's a link to our javascript file
61:58 - so we'll do the following we'll do
62:00 - script like this
62:04 - script source
62:06 - is equal to what script source is equal
62:09 - to
62:10 - equal to what guys js
62:13 - right scripted js boom
62:19 - boom done so script source js and this
62:22 - will include our javascript file now
62:24 - so now if i click on it again boom i was
62:27 - clicked
62:30 - and that my friends is pretty much it
62:32 - right but of course let's go ahead and
62:34 - modify this a little bit so let's go to
62:35 - script.js okay
62:38 - and now that we've got the find job how
62:40 - do we
62:41 - get the text that i put in here so let's
62:43 - say for example i'm trying to find a
62:44 - full-time job here and i say
62:46 - full time okay how do i grab that text
62:49 - guys
62:50 - that's right that's right document the
62:53 - query selector so here's will do
62:55 - so we'll say let text
62:58 - is equal to a document
63:02 - that get what we'll do uh because we
63:05 - have very selective
63:06 - here we'll do a we do we'll actually do
63:08 - an id because we have a id here right
63:10 - here
63:11 - right because yeah i was about to say so
63:13 - we want to target that input and in
63:15 - order to do that we're going to use the
63:17 - id
63:17 - that is on that input guys because an
63:20 - input is not a class right so we're not
63:21 - going to use query selector
63:23 - or query selector all right we're going
63:24 - to use something get
63:26 - element by id yes that way we're going
63:29 - to get that
63:29 - input with an id of filter jobs okay
63:33 - and if you do dot value after the
63:36 - sentence
63:38 - that's how you will get the value of
63:40 - that input
63:41 - that's right so that document that give
63:43 - my id we'll do
63:44 - that value right here okay that value
63:47 - and this will give us the value so we
63:48 - can so login now
63:50 - let's try that console.log it right now
63:52 - okay
63:53 - what is the text that's the text right
63:57 - i was clicked but i fi for example full
63:59 - time let me see
64:02 - console log i need to refresh it maybe
64:09 - do you have that yeah
64:13 - uh no not yet hold on
64:18 - let me put the water up on for you guys
64:20 - you guys can see the word
64:22 - rap ripping the words
64:29 - oh that value let's go right there okay
64:32 - that's great
64:35 - hey there's the text asd
64:38 - so what we did is we look at this if i
64:39 - do it again here
64:43 - right if i say full time
64:47 - full time boom
64:50 - full time what is in the text right what
64:54 - doesn't it text right there
64:55 - so that's pretty much it okay so console
64:56 - log so we got that so now that we got
64:58 - that
64:59 - we're good okay we're good now we got
65:01 - that okay
65:02 - so i'm going to save this right here i'm
65:04 - going to save this right here
65:06 - and the one thing i want to do is
65:07 - actually change this
65:09 - thing so if i click you see if i hover
65:10 - over this it doesn't act like it's a
65:12 - button
65:13 - so i'm going to change to make it act
65:15 - like it's a button okay
65:17 - so let's do it right now so i'm going to
65:19 - click go to back to my style of css
65:21 - i'm going to button the container i'm
65:22 - going to say cursor pointer
65:26 - right here so i'm going to save that so
65:28 - if i hold this now it's a button
65:29 - receiver
65:30 - right there you see and then i'm going
65:33 - to click
65:34 - hover state so i'm going to say the
65:37 - button container hover on the button
65:40 - container right there
65:42 - okay so on the hover what do you think
65:44 - we should do
65:45 - on the hover guys
65:48 - what are you doing the hover well all we
65:50 - do is just simply change the that's
65:52 - right
65:52 - it will we can actually yes we can
65:54 - invert the color but here's another
65:56 - pointer
65:57 - so either sometimes you invert the color
65:59 - or
66:00 - sometimes you just make the color right
66:02 - lighter or darker
66:04 - so for example yeah that's right that's
66:06 - right so for example if i just simply go
66:07 - ahead and i do
66:09 - a i'm just looking here hold on one
66:10 - second i'm trying to find my
66:12 - button container i'm trying to find that
66:14 - color right there
66:16 - i got it so right there that's right so
66:19 - background is gonna be this color i'm
66:21 - gonna put it for you guys in the chat
66:24 - oh this one it doesn't it doesn't defer
66:27 - that much guys but it's a little bit
66:29 - lighter as you can see
66:32 - see you see it's just a little bit
66:34 - lighter just a bit you see that right
66:36 - there
66:37 - just a tad right and then we can even
66:39 - add a small transition to it so we'll
66:41 - say transition
66:44 - all 0.2 seconds ease
66:49 - okay right there save that and so now if
66:51 - i hover oh
66:52 - look at that you see now it's a very
66:54 - slight transition now
66:56 - with that color and it makes it feel
66:58 - like it's a button
67:00 - and that's it that's it guys right
67:01 - mister feel like it's a button
67:03 - beautiful awesome so i love that portion
67:06 - i love that portion
67:07 - at this point what is next jesse
67:11 - oh the button okay so
67:14 - wait rewind did we finish the search
67:18 - container the search bar we did
67:20 - we did whoa looks
67:23 - amazing guys looks amazing right please
67:26 - set it in the chat if you are
67:28 - where we are right now plus what do you
67:31 - think

67:48 - love it ready
67:49 - ready megan is ready 100 understood oh
67:52 - we love that oh yeah people
67:54 - the great jobs section correct that's
67:57 - correct guys
67:58 - that is correct so i always
68:02 - you know when i build something like
68:03 - this i always break it down
68:06 - okay so i know
68:10 - that hmm what do we notice about these
68:13 - jobs guys
68:14 - every single job what do we notice about
68:16 - them
68:19 - what what do we notice about them well
68:22 - they all have
68:23 - a top section right the logo
68:27 - and the um horizontal three dot
68:30 - icon okay
68:33 - we have a a roll
68:37 - a role position role a job job name
68:40 - that's right okay we have a description
68:45 - that's right and then what do we have
68:46 - after that yeah also the two buttons
68:49 - which is one section of buttons
68:51 - and all that is aside the encapsulating
68:53 - inside of what inside
68:55 - this portion right here you see that
68:57 - right it's only a capsule inside here
68:59 - okay so i think at first what do you
69:02 - think jesse what should we start out
69:03 - with before we
69:04 - worry so much about these little thing
69:06 - the beeps think i think they think the
69:08 - bobs
69:09 - right what do we do i think just just
69:12 - make
69:12 - one one thing what should we call it a
69:15 - tile
69:16 - a job element we can call a job
69:20 - yeah we can call a tile a job tile a job
69:23 - title so this this
69:24 - this one thing is a job tile but before
69:26 - we do this job tile
69:27 - shouldn't we create all of these grids
69:29 - to figure out to make sure that we have
69:31 - all these grids or no
69:33 - yeah for sure because what's the benefit
69:35 - of using a grid in this case nice
69:37 - i really don't don't know you don't know
69:40 - i don't know
69:41 - well let's say you make the screen very
69:44 - big
69:44 - and you make it also very small let's
69:46 - see what happens
69:47 - let's see oh you see it stretches and it
69:51 - shrinks right here
69:53 - right but it's always three columns and
69:55 - three
69:57 - well three more rows depending on how
69:58 - many jobs we have but it's always in
70:00 - three columns
70:01 - it never changes so that's very
70:03 - beneficial about using css grid okay
70:06 - guys
70:06 - so hmm yeah let's make the board first
70:10 - or the jobs list actually the jobs list
70:14 - and let's make a grid out of that and
70:16 - then once we have the grid
70:18 - then we can go deeper yep exactly then
70:20 - we can make
70:21 - and then we'll just make one thing right
70:23 - and of course somebody asked about what
70:25 - but what about the 75 jobs don't worry
70:26 - about that we got you my friends we
70:28 - watch
70:28 - we'll make that into a div too
70:31 - don't worry i got you yeah yeah yeah
70:34 - yeah yeah yeah awesome so let's continue
70:35 - on
70:36 - so go ahead let's continue it yeah so
70:38 - we're gonna go back to our index.html
70:41 - okay guys and it's going to be below the
70:44 - search of course
70:45 - what i'm highlighting here okay so there
70:48 - we're going to open up another class div
70:51 - class
70:52 - and we're going to call it jobs dash
70:55 - oops does
70:56 - blend up list
71:01 - this whole is the camp solution of that
71:03 - just so you guys know okay that's that
71:05 - guy yeah okay
71:06 - so jobs also continue on and
71:09 - for now i'm just going to say this h1
71:12 - i'm going to make this one static okay
71:15 - [Music]
71:16 - so 15 jobs
71:20 - oh and i'm going to have to do that

71:29 - after be below that i'm gonna have
71:32 - all the jobs right sorry to cut you off
71:34 - jesse but we have to put the div
71:36 - inside the h1 right here it's right so

71:56 - container as well
71:57 - yeah that's great there we go nice so
72:01 - hey there's a div yeah thank you so
72:04 - the container will actually contain and
72:07 - will be the grid
72:09 - that will be the grid that will be the
72:10 - one below showing
72:12 - 20 15 jobs in this case okay so then
72:15 - i'm going to make one tile and what
72:18 - should we name it what should be the
72:19 - class of that that tile guys what do you
72:20 - guys think what's with the class of that
72:21 - tile
72:24 - what should it cuts a towel that just no
72:26 - not jobs this is this is only for one
72:28 - job
72:29 - card job towel that's right money out
72:32 - that's right so let's do job title
72:33 - jesse job dash tile that's right yep oop
72:36 - tickle
72:39 - yes
72:43 - all right and for now
72:47 - go ahead and then what and for now i
72:50 - think
72:51 - we don't really do much this point do we
72:53 - right no i don't think so either i think
72:55 - let's just create let's just create a
72:56 - bunch of job tiles
72:58 - just for us to see how they work how
73:00 - about right we can also we can put some
73:02 - text here
73:02 - just to be sure so it has something in
73:04 - it okay so
73:05 - one job okay like this okay
73:09 - good so that said
73:13 - who remembers how you make a grid
73:17 - from yesterday's game who remembers guys
73:21 - who remembers guys let me know in the
73:23 - chat display
73:24 - grid very good henry steven very good
73:28 - very good
73:29 - so we're gonna go to style the css
73:32 - and we're going to be targeting the let
73:35 - me see
73:35 - the jobs list okay jobs list so
73:39 - dot jobs list like this
73:42 - okay and that way
73:45 - we can make that into a grid
73:49 - now first of all
73:52 - like we did before oh wait we're not
73:55 - going to make that one in the grid yet
73:57 - because
73:58 - jobs list is not the grid we just said
74:00 - it i said it myself
74:02 - actually jobs container is the grid okay
74:05 - jobs list is the one that also has that
74:08 - text
74:09 - inside of it so it's a little bit more
74:11 - around it
74:12 - but i'm also going to give it a max
74:15 - weight of 1250 pixel
74:17 - okay and like we've done before i'm
74:20 - gonna
74:21 - give it a width of 100
74:24 - right now in order for us to see
74:28 - it let's give it a color also which is
74:31 - a little bit of a darker gray black
74:34 - blackish just right now just for us to
74:35 - see it is that what shine is due
74:38 - yeah just okay let's see
74:42 - so right here
74:45 - oh
74:49 - one job it's only showing one job yeah
74:51 - one job um
74:53 - i'm gonna give it a height hey
74:56 - why is it not
75:00 - lagging tagging okay it's fine do you
75:03 - want me to type i can type is fine yeah
75:05 - okay type height yeah so let's do height
75:08 - so for the jobs list uh are we working
75:10 - on the jobs list are we working on the
75:11 - which one or the
75:12 - job tile we're working on the jobs list
75:16 - so we're working on the whole
75:17 - surroundings
75:18 - yeah um the whole slide yes okay
75:22 - loading is showing 5 15 jobs yeah i got
75:24 - it got it okay so we have the job list
75:26 - this is right here the surrounding
75:27 - so the jobs list is the whole
75:28 - surrounding correct and of course and
75:30 - now inside that we have the showing for
75:32 - the jobs which is what we see right now
75:33 - correct you guys
75:34 - right that's right that's right which is
75:36 - this one
75:37 - okay that's a showing 15 jobs and then
75:40 - we have a jobs click here that's going
75:41 - to contain
75:42 - individual job okay guys that's what we
75:44 - have
75:45 - now also i want to do i want to create a
75:47 - few jobs i'm going to say one div class
75:49 - one job and i'm going to create a few
75:50 - jobs boom
75:51 - boom boom boom boom boom boom i'm gonna
75:53 - command c
75:54 - command v just so that we have multiple
75:57 - jobs yeah we have one job
75:59 - but don't worry about that right now
76:00 - that's not the most important thing okay
76:03 - okay awesome sweet after that what we
76:06 - need to do is the following okay
76:07 - let's remove uh actually we got the
76:09 - width let's go ahead and give it a
76:11 - height of 100 v8 height
76:14 - i can type again okay so give it a
76:17 - height of 100 let me type
76:18 - jesse jesse yeah i'm sorry yeah height
76:21 - over 100 vh
76:24 - 100 vh okay right there
76:28 - there okay out of 100 vh right so that
76:31 - way it's 100 vertical height basically
76:33 - that's 100 vertical height that's kind
76:34 - of what we're doing here right now okay
76:36 - that's 100 height and then we'll get a
76:38 - margin zero auto for the jobs
76:40 - list because of course that will make it
76:43 - center so if i for example do like this
76:45 - you see nothing so far is happening it's
76:48 - not it's still staying the left-hand
76:49 - side but
76:50 - if i do margin zero auto if i do margin
76:53 - zero out on the jobs list
76:55 - it should technically work so let me go
76:56 - do it again boom right there you see
76:59 - one right there you see it now went
77:00 - together with
77:02 - everything right that's what kind of
77:05 - what happened there
77:05 - awesome that's it after that point let's
77:08 - go ahead and do the following which is
77:10 - we're going to give it a display flex
77:12 - because
77:13 - we need to what we need to do what what
77:15 - do you guys think
77:16 - we need to go from top to bottom right
77:18 - from top
77:19 - to bottom and we're going to get a flex
77:21 - direction column guys
77:23 - okay let's direct column awesome
77:26 - sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet awesome
77:28 - sweet column
77:30 - nice column okay and
77:33 - at that point we're pretty much done
77:35 - with this one
77:37 - one thing i want to do is shall we give
77:38 - it a padding jesse
77:40 - yeah okay let's give it a penalty
77:42 - padding over it might not be visible due
77:45 - to yeah okay let's give it a padding
77:48 - [Music]
77:52 - 0-25 pixels jesse yeah
77:56 - padding of 012 pixels because you can
77:58 - see here this creates the padding from
78:00 - the right hand side
78:01 - and so that's what we're going to do as
78:02 - well so padding is your turn on the
78:04 - right hand side
78:04 - and the left hand side beautiful and so
78:06 - now the reason why we do that
78:08 - is because guys whenever you create
78:09 - applications
78:11 - want some things to align you see how
78:13 - this aligns with that this aligns with
78:15 - that then this
78:16 - is going to align with that right but it
78:18 - doesn't all have to be aligned because
78:21 - for example on the h1 section so go to
78:23 - h1 section jesse
78:26 - yep on the h1 section
78:29 - jobs list okay if we just simply give
78:33 - the
78:33 - a margin left of 25 pixels
78:36 - margin left
78:40 - yes right margin left
78:44 - save that see it kind of makes it more
78:47 - to the right hand side but which is okay
78:49 - because
78:50 - it actually aligns with the search icon
78:52 - so this is a tidbit for you on the ui ux
78:55 - side
78:56 - you want your things to align with
78:58 - certain things it doesn't all have to be
79:00 - aligned together
79:02 - but it is helpful for example the search
79:05 - icon is aligned with that
79:07 - but this the jobs are aligned with this
79:09 - portion you guys see that yes or no
79:11 - do you guys see that yes or no comprende
79:14 - yeah it's good right that's really good
79:15 - so
79:16 - that's a very really cool ui ux tip for
79:18 - you okay
79:20 - okay after that what else what else so
79:22 - we have the each one
79:23 - which kind of covers that what's the
79:25 - next one jesse is need to font size
79:27 - 20 pixels of that h1 go ahead jesse so
79:30 - put a font size 20 pixels on this one
79:32 - that's done so let's save that that
79:34 - makes it a little bit smaller
79:35 - and now at this point let's go ahead and
79:37 - focus on
79:38 - let's go to focus on the actual the
79:40 - block right the actual
79:42 - container right yes that's right so
79:46 - guys we're first going to be focusing on
79:48 - the jobs container which is sort of like
79:50 - the parent
79:52 - grid right the whole grid that's right
79:54 - so
79:55 - here we're going to say display
79:59 - and it's not lex it's grid
80:02 - it's grid and grid is similar grid is
80:05 - similar to flex guys
80:07 - grid is similar to flex but the issue
80:10 - the cool thing the grid is you can
80:11 - specify
80:12 - columns which is what we like to do
80:14 - right
80:15 - right so that said by the way we're
80:18 - gonna
80:18 - use something like this just what we
80:21 - used yesterday
80:23 - okay and we're gonna do that thing again
80:25 - whereby we're gonna say
80:27 - hey i want from the container
80:30 - 1 3 to be one fraction and i want you to
80:33 - repeat that
80:34 - so all of those tiles within those in
80:37 - this grid
80:38 - will be the same okay so i'm gonna say
80:40 - repeat
80:42 - three three one four one fr and the one
80:45 - fr
80:46 - simply means that you know what expand
80:49 - my grid to as far as possible and what's
80:52 - gonna make that happen is
80:53 - now these three grids are all the same
80:56 - width
80:57 - because if i for example go to a job
80:59 - tile let's give it let's go to the dub
81:01 - job tile section right and if i give it
81:04 - a specific
81:05 - background let's just say we give it a
81:07 - background of uh pink for now
81:11 - just the first thing it comes out to
81:12 - mine so right
81:14 - so right there this right here you see
81:16 - how they're those same width guys
81:18 - right but you can't see it so let me
81:20 - make it a little bit more visible by
81:22 - changing the get
81:23 - uh gap right i'm gonna say gap
81:26 - 40 pixel that way you can see this guy's
81:29 - better see this better
81:30 - go ahead so save that yeah save
81:33 - and boom so this gap this creates a gap
81:36 - between
81:36 - every single element that's a gap of 40
81:38 - pixels guys
81:39 - yeah that's really really cool right and
81:42 - now you can see what nas was explaining
81:44 - when i interrupted him but now you can
81:46 - see that those three fractions
81:49 - three times one fraction now if i do
81:52 - this two hundred look at this if i do
81:53 - 200 pixels for this one
81:55 - see so i can either do a static width
81:58 - for every single element or i can do one
82:00 - fr
82:01 - which is says hey you know what expand
82:03 - as much as possible that's a little bit
82:04 - happens okay
82:05 - so now that we have now that we have the
82:07 - specific section let's go and remove the
82:09 - job
82:10 - uh the container what do we do for the
82:12 - container as well jesse
82:14 - um we still want we want
82:17 - um the container to grow as big as
82:20 - possible
82:20 - mm-hmm so what are they doing right flex
82:22 - coral
82:26 - which means like take up the maximum
82:28 - space that is available
82:30 - hey you see so it's going to take as
82:32 - much space as possible that's going to
82:34 - happen
82:35 - okay so that's good and then i'm going
82:36 - to give it also a template so i want to
82:38 - say
82:38 - grid template
82:44 - some some of these ambulances off
82:48 - so funny repeat three
82:52 - also one of our so we're gonna have
82:54 - three uh columns
82:56 - and three rows jesse is that right yeah
82:59 - or well we don't have to specify the
83:01 - rows in case we have
83:02 - more jobs you can also say that you want
83:04 - to show more yeah i guess we don't need
83:06 - to
83:06 - really need these rules right right
83:08 - that's why i didn't say anything about
83:10 - it yet but
83:11 - that's that's the the decision you guys
83:13 - can make
83:14 - okay so of course this one also has
83:18 - a margin of zero 25 pixel
83:21 - okay like this and the background is a
83:24 - certain color
83:26 - okay yeah so the margin is easy to fix
83:28 - those but for now because
83:29 - this thing actually it's 25 pixels we
83:31 - don't really need that at this point
83:32 - because we put a padding the last time
83:34 - no we don't
83:35 - because the pattern was here right yeah
83:36 - yeah you don't need that you're totally
83:38 - right that's right we're right
83:39 - right you're right so background
83:43 - boom right nice okay save that that's
83:48 - going to remove this job tile pink color
83:49 - because we need that anymore
83:50 - [Music]
83:53 - but you can change it you can change
83:54 - that color okay what can we change to
83:56 - orange yes there we go that makes so
83:58 - much money
83:59 - thank you
84:04 - oh my god thank you holy holy moly okay
84:07 - holy
84:08 - nice okay that said guys of course
84:12 - i mean because of the flex grow it just
84:15 - takes up the whole space right so that's
84:16 - pretty nice so we can just style this
84:18 - tile and then
84:20 - like we want it right so i'm going to
84:22 - give it a border oh shoot
84:24 - border radius
84:28 - of 10 pixel and i'm very consequent with
84:30 - these guys because
84:32 - in the search container nas also used a
84:35 - border radius of 10 pixel
84:37 - even for the button he also used one of
84:39 - 10 pixels so you want in your design you
84:41 - want to be
84:42 - consistent in that that makes your
84:44 - design look really
84:46 - uh neat and slick okay is a big key guys
84:49 - it's a big key okay
84:52 - so of course curse a pointer when we
84:54 - point on it
84:55 - okay and um
84:58 - [Music]
85:00 - first okay let's first think about this
85:03 - okay guys
85:04 - inside of this um
85:07 - [Music]
85:09 - job tile how do we want things to
85:11 - display
85:13 - how do we want things display okay so of
85:16 - course we're going to be using this play
85:17 - flex
85:19 - right and i also want things because
85:22 - remember right we had
85:23 - we have the top the title the icon and
85:26 - the
85:27 - the three dot thing we have the role
85:30 - we have the description and that we have
85:33 - the bottom so
85:34 - hmm i think my flex direction should not
85:36 - be
85:37 - row but it should be column that's right
85:40 - okay so row is the default direction of
85:42 - display flex
85:43 - but we want to change it so we're going
85:45 - to say column okay so it's vertically
85:47 - aligned okay guys
85:49 - then of course i want everything to be
85:50 - in the middle so i'm going to say
85:52 - justify
85:53 - oh justify content
85:57 - center nice and i want everything to be
86:00 - the color of white nice okay
86:03 - also i can see that my one job is still
86:08 - touching the edge you don't want that
86:12 - you don't want the content to be
86:13 - touching your
86:14 - the edge of your job tile at all so i'm
86:16 - gonna give it a padding
86:17 - of 30 pixels that's right
86:21 - boom you see so now it's gonna push so
86:23 - everything inside here
86:24 - is gonna be pushed from the left from
86:26 - the top
86:27 - from the right and from the bottom guys
86:29 - it makes sense comprende
86:30 - good good good all right let's go
86:32 - continue on jesse so guys it's just in
86:34 - the middle because we only have two
86:35 - words but we'll change that in a moment
86:37 - okay that said oh
86:40 - do you want to make there's something
86:42 - really cool we're gonna do let's do that
86:44 - maybe let's wait with that hold on
86:45 - hold on what do you have right now let's
86:46 - hover right yeah really yeah oh okay so
86:50 - guys we're gonna make a hover how do you
86:52 - make a hover on a diff class
86:54 - what do you think what do you guys think
86:56 - anybody
86:57 - say it yeah the job tile
87:01 - exactly that job dash tile right i'm
87:03 - gonna say the hover on this one
87:05 - right now the really cool thing about
87:07 - the hover for example in this specific
87:09 - hub right when i hover you see how it
87:10 - becomes bigger
87:11 - this card so the way to make that work
87:14 - is we use something called a transform
87:16 - scale
87:17 - so look trend uh-huh transform
87:21 - transform right
87:25 - scale right here yeah a scale to what
87:28 - let's say 1.05 so biscuit if we do
87:32 - two skill two it's gonna scale to two
87:34 - times the size
87:35 - right so this is gonna scale it
87:37 - basically in terms of like how big it is
87:39 - right
87:39 - so look well i think it's gonna scale
87:42 - this one it's gonna scale like five
87:43 - percent bigger than the original size
87:46 - so see it's scaling but it still looks
87:48 - horrible because we didn't
87:49 - put a transition on it right
87:52 - so let's put a transition transition
87:56 - on which attribute the transform
87:58 - attribute
88:00 - right and we're going to give it a 0.2
88:03 - seconds
88:04 - so now if i hover oh
88:08 - how cool is that
88:16 - yeah that's what i'm talking about guys
88:18 - that's awesome so now that we've got
88:20 - that
88:20 - i think the next thing we need to do is
88:22 - actually work on
88:24 - making all this content inside here
88:27 - right
88:28 - that's the next one so let's go and work
88:29 - on that jesse yeah for sure so let's go
88:32 - back to our index.html guys
88:34 - and as i said before it contains like
88:36 - four sections right
88:38 - so we have the top section
88:42 - or you want to call it different you can
88:44 - tell me too now
88:45 - the top is fine go ahead top okay and
88:48 - i'm just going to make it
88:49 - so it's inside of the the job tile okay
88:52 - guys so don't worry about the rest of
88:53 - the job tiles i'm just going to focus on
88:55 - one job tile okay so
88:58 - um class that's the top section
89:03 - right and hmm there's an image in here
89:07 - okay just make sure you put it inside
89:09 - the idea of jesse please
89:11 - yeah that is very good catch
89:15 - yeah and well guys
89:18 - we could um get a picture from somewhere
89:22 - okay um and use that as a source
89:26 - so i got you a picture i got your
89:28 - picture this is the picture right here
89:29 - copy my address
89:30 - and i'll get you the picture right here
89:32 - boom right there
89:34 - awesome
89:37 - that's the picture i got for you okay
89:39 - yeah and
89:41 - now we want to have that icon that those
89:44 - three dots
89:45 - we want to have that so but we're not
89:48 - going to use that from
89:48 - font awesome we're going to be using
89:50 - that for material ui
89:52 - icons really that's how you use that
89:54 - does font awesome not have those icons
89:55 - by the way
89:56 - really
90:00 - it does i think maybe okay you want to
90:02 - check it out yeah let's check it out so
90:03 - if i go to font awesome
90:07 - i found awesome so we don't have to
90:09 - import anything
90:11 - front off but i also thought it was fun
90:13 - to see because it's really easy to use
90:14 - that
90:15 - actually yeah okay let's do it your way

90:20 - thank you so guys
90:23 - you can span class and then
90:27 - you say material icons
90:31 - and i'm going to give it a name so this
90:34 - name i came up with it
90:35 - myself okay this is by the way the name
90:38 - of that icon
90:39 - how material ui names that okay
90:43 - and here but inside of your spam to pay
90:45 - attention inside of your span
90:47 - we're going to say this
90:50 - and that is how material icons will know
90:54 - that this will be an icon in your app
90:57 - okay so how we're going to link that up
91:00 - there if you go to the side of material
91:02 - ui icons you can find a link there and
91:05 - just like

92:23 - because there's
92:24 - two different types there's a font

92:28 - one but okay awesome oh you already put
92:30 - one sorry jesse

93:02 - yeah let's do that let's do it let's go
93:04 - to stella
93:05 - says and on the job tile
93:08 - instead of doing orange we're going to
93:09 - change the different type of color we're
93:11 - going to change it to a color that just
93:12 - going to put in right now
93:14 - yes so that is again that
93:17 - grayish color
93:21 - it's the same color as the search

93:41 - let's let's
93:41 - let's do the top section okay because
93:43 - then we got that portion already done
93:45 - okay the top section okay right the top
93:47 - section because as you can see guys
93:49 - what's wrong with this top section we
93:51 - don't want those two items to be
93:53 - vertically aligned right no so top
93:57 - and i can make this very visible for you
93:58 - guys i know maybe you already get sick
94:00 - of it but
94:01 - it's just very handy it just makes makes

94:05 - easy to understand too for you guys okay
94:08 - so
94:08 - boom there it is and there the three
94:11 - dots is at the bottom okay
94:13 - so i'm gonna give that a width i'm gonna
94:15 - give this
94:16 - a width of a hundred percent this top
94:21 - okay and i'm going to give it a display
94:23 - flex
94:25 - now of course as you can see
94:28 - you cannot see it now if i remove the
94:30 - aquamarine color
94:32 - you can see that the dots are now
94:35 - at the top on the right you see that
94:40 - you see that so let me first now
94:43 - stop wait up hey
94:46 - sorry about that go ahead that's okay
94:49 - and then let's target the image so it's
94:51 - a little bit smaller and we can see
94:52 - what's actually happening okay
94:54 - so that top image
94:57 - and it's very small we're gonna only
94:59 - make it like 50 pixels okay
95:01 - boom nice okay i like that i like that
95:04 - so that's right there okay
95:05 - awesome yeah but as you can see it is
95:08 - next to each other and that's not
95:09 - something that we want
95:10 - no right how do we so how do we spread
95:12 - that around
95:14 - so we can spread that around by going to
95:16 - the top section
95:17 - okay and on line 133 i'm gonna give it
95:21 - a justify content of space between
95:26 - okay so as you can see guys what kind of
95:29 - color should i give it
95:30 - blue maybe it's very visible
95:34 - boom there we go that's nice nice right
95:36 - there it is
95:37 - okay right there that's
95:40 - all that's looking really good look at
95:42 - that awesome i like that so this is
95:43 - looking really really good so we got the

96:56 - example here now we have a lead product
96:57 - design
96:58 - right here okay and let's continue on
97:01 - so here diff class description
97:04 - mm-hmm that's with the next order that
97:08 - yeah and here inside of this one i'm
97:10 - just going to put some
97:12 - spam with some
97:15 - laura lorem ipsum inside of it just to
97:18 - make things a little bit easy for now
97:21 - okay that's nice nice nice so the little
97:24 - chat
97:24 - give you guys the lauren epsom while you
97:26 - guys by jesse you're typing right here
97:28 - oh you got it okay
97:29 - go ahead and of course after the
97:31 - description section
97:32 - we're gonna go into the button section
97:36 - so i'm gonna say here div class
97:38 - buttons and
97:42 - i thought okay let's make this a little
97:44 - bit handy so i'm gonna say diff class
97:48 - button button
97:52 - and i'm going to call this one apply now
97:54 - right
97:55 - that's going to be the apply now button
97:56 - right right
97:58 - so here apply now
98:02 - and here i'm just going to say button
98:07 - and you'll see in a moment why i don't
98:10 - need to give that
98:11 - another class as well okay
98:15 - so message
98:18 - now we got all of the sections now
98:21 - inside of our job towel but as you guys
98:24 - can see it's a little bit packed
98:26 - right it needs spacing it needs styling
98:29 - and all that so let's do that
98:31 - so we go to stella css okay let's go
98:33 - ahead
98:34 - all right beautiful beautiful
98:37 - and then first of all of course we're
98:40 - going to start
98:41 - with title mm-hmm
98:44 - so as you can see the title is touching
98:48 - everything at the bottom at the top
98:51 - and that's not something that we really
98:52 - want no right
98:54 - so i'm gonna give this a margin
98:58 - okay of 20 pixel and again this this
99:01 - right here is means top and bottom
99:02 - margin
99:03 - yes this right here means left and right
99:05 - margin guys okay left and right
99:07 - so top and bottom is 20 pixels save that
99:10 - and there's no margin for now
99:15 - so i think the reason why there's no so
99:17 - there's no it doesn't show the margins
99:18 - the reason why doesn't show the margin
99:19 - is because sometimes
99:20 - when you use when you use display flex
99:22 - that's something will happen so if you
99:24 - actually put into a padding
99:26 - that will actually work so padding
99:30 - so save that oh that doesn't work that
99:31 - way let me see so title title title i
99:34 - think we did we changed the title
99:35 - name let's see oh yeah we did
99:39 - so it's actually your role name my bad
99:41 - real name yeah
99:44 - roll date okay so save that
99:48 - boom right there awesome and penny still
99:50 - works by the way so it's not an issue
99:51 - but the padding of the margin honestly
99:54 - next one yep so next one
99:57 - um roll name and then we wanna um
100:01 - target that span inside of the roll name
100:03 - let's give it a font size of 22 pixels
100:06 - font size 22 pixel that's pretty much
100:08 - and of course
100:09 - that's it nope we don't need it because
100:11 - we defined the the font family at the
100:12 - top
100:13 - right right so other than that
100:16 - let's go on to the description correct
100:18 - [Music]
100:20 - and the description guys hmm let's say i
100:23 - have a lot of text what is something you
100:25 - can do
100:26 - to avoid it from overflowing so we want
100:30 - to give it a fixed height that's part
100:31 - one it's a fixer which is really really
100:32 - important okay
100:33 - so let's go give it a fix hi jesse yeah
100:36 - so i'm going to give it a height
100:38 - of 105 pixels that's right okay and then
100:42 - we'll give one i'm going to give it this
100:45 - right so because sometimes for example
100:47 - sometimes what might happen is you might
100:49 - have too much text right
100:50 - inside here and so you want to prevent
100:52 - our goals to run too much text so five
100:54 - by the way it's not description by the
100:55 - way it's something uh description
100:58 - that's right description let me see we
101:01 - just make sure it's all good
101:02 - description okay so that's good so if i
101:05 - save this if i right click inspect them
101:07 - on this one
101:07 - okay let's see what the height is
101:09 - currently let's see what the current
101:10 - height is
101:11 - so the current height of this element
101:13 - right the current is somewhere let me
101:14 - put it into a dark side here
101:17 - the current height of this element right
101:19 - here description l you see is 105
101:21 - exactly
101:22 - right it's 105 pixels exactly which is
101:24 - really cool right
101:25 - 100 exactly so exactly what's what what
101:28 - we're going to do as well
101:30 - right and so this prevents any anything
101:32 - else from going larger than that
101:33 - all right at this point so we've got a
101:36 - description
101:37 - let's work on the next thing let's work
101:39 - on the actual font size
101:40 - we can also on the description we can
101:42 - say font size on this one so we could do
101:44 - a font size
101:47 - of 18 pixels right to make a little bit
101:50 - larger smaller right and we can do a
101:53 - different color as well on this one
101:55 - yeah there you go nice that's awesome so
101:57 - save that
101:58 - but
102:03 - now let's go over to the buttons guys
102:06 - that's right
102:07 - so that is one big class as you can see
102:10 - and again i'm gonna make it visible okay
102:13 - like this boom nice let's see
102:17 - so save that a nice so we have the apply
102:20 - now button right here
102:21 - and of course the message now button and
102:23 - these will become buttons here in a
102:24 - second
102:25 - so i'm going to make it a little bit i'm
102:27 - gonna make the letters black for now so
102:28 - you guys can actually really see it
102:30 - [Music]
102:31 - but let's let's let's think about this
102:34 - too you know first of all
102:35 - we don't want the buttons to be touching
102:37 - the text
102:39 - above it okay so i'm going to give it a
102:41 - margin top of 20 pixel
102:43 - that's right so margin tells me okay
102:45 - awesome
102:46 - boom it will move nicely to the yeah
102:49 - let's go
102:50 - awesome and then again of course guys
102:53 - what do we want in those but what would
102:56 - you what do we want
102:57 - apply now and measures are at top of
102:59 - each other but we want them to be
103:01 - left and right of each other right so
103:04 - this split flex of course
103:07 - and what else guys justify content space
103:11 - between that's right that's right that's
103:13 - right nice
103:14 - oh sweet space between there we go so
103:17 - they're taking up the most space
103:19 - that's put that between them basically
103:22 - okay
103:23 - that said i'm also gonna give the
103:25 - buttons a height
103:27 - okay a fixed height
103:30 - boom there we go nice nice nice nice
103:33 - nice awesome so we got
103:34 - a fixed height okay and what's next
103:36 - jesse i'm gonna
103:38 - i'm gonna define one button okay one
103:41 - button
103:41 - so now we have this whole group right
103:43 - that has two buttons
103:44 - and now we're gonna work on individual
103:46 - buttons right now at this point
103:48 - right so if i would give this a
103:50 - background color you wouldn't
103:52 - be able to see it because look it would
103:54 - just cover the whole button section
103:56 - that's right exactly you know so
103:59 - this is what we're gonna do we're gonna
104:01 - give each of these buttons we're gonna
104:03 - give the button a flex of one
104:06 - so why are we doing that jesse what do
104:08 - you think
104:09 - um i want the button to stick up as much
104:11 - space as possible
104:13 - that's right right so we're trying to
104:14 - make it so for example if you do
104:15 - background color green
104:16 - do by glitter green for a second here
104:19 - you're able to see that
104:20 - that basically that will allow will
104:23 - allow you to see that it will take as
104:24 - much space as possible
104:27 - yep see there you go see so yeah it
104:29 - takes up the whole thing because there's
104:30 - two buttons right now right
104:31 - so now let's go ahead and remove this
104:32 - for a second here okay good
104:35 - let's continue on with the next the next
104:36 - button or the button right now
104:40 - well i want to
104:43 - inside of the one each button actually i
104:46 - want the text to be in the middle right
104:47 - so again i'm going to be using
104:49 - display flex and i'm going to say
104:53 - justify content center but i'm also
104:55 - going to
104:56 - center it vertically right so i'm going
104:57 - to also use our familiar align item
105:00 - center
105:01 - plus i'm going to say border radius
105:04 - 10 pixel nice okay i like it
105:08 - i like it so and i'm going to give the
105:12 - grayish color to the letters okay this
105:16 - one
105:17 - and we can pop it into the chat okay
105:19 - whoops
105:20 - i got it i got you yeah i got it and
105:24 - i'm also hey why can't i not type can
105:28 - you type
105:28 - yeah type so then we're also going to
105:30 - give it a background color as well so
105:31 - let's go ahead and give every single
105:32 - button a background color as well
105:34 - so let's do this boom right there
105:38 - so let's do the background color right
105:40 - here save that
105:41 - okay so now you can start to see the
105:42 - buttons right right you start to see the
105:44 - buttons
105:45 - let's remove the background pink so
105:47 - because we're at this point
105:48 - wait wait wait no wait a moment no
105:51 - because look i
105:52 - i still want to show because there's one
105:55 - button is different from the other one
105:57 - right so first of all let's change the
105:59 - font size
106:00 - to font size 14 on each button
106:03 - okay so font size font size 14
106:08 - 14 pixels okay so it makes it a little
106:10 - bit smaller which is awesome
106:12 - okay and what
106:15 - now i want to target the apply now
106:18 - so let's do class apply now
106:22 - apply dash now okay yeah and then when i
106:25 - say color for this one
106:27 - color is going to be white right
106:31 - yeah it's going to be white and then
106:33 - when i change the background color
106:35 - background i'm going to change the color
106:36 - of that is going to be that blue one
106:38 - which is the blue one that we have yeah
106:40 - that blue one that's right jesse yeah
106:42 - that blue one so the royal blue one nice
106:44 - that's awesome
106:45 - that's good okay so guys as you can see
106:48 - we did this by only using
106:50 - one button class so apply now is
106:54 - therefore has the same size and the same
106:57 - border radius and
106:58 - all and is also centered the textview is
107:00 - centered
107:01 - just like a message now and notches also
107:04 - but only on the apply now button we're
107:07 - doing some customization
107:09 - that's right that's customization so but
107:11 - that's why when we go to inside html
107:13 - guys that's why every single button here
107:14 - you see there's a
107:15 - they have a shared class right we use
107:17 - shared classes so that we can go ahead
107:20 - and apply
107:20 - the same class to multiple things right
107:23 - that's the whole goal at the end of the
107:25 - day right in the same situation with
107:26 - here
107:29 - awesome so we got that let's go and
107:30 - remove the back of color pink now can we
107:32 - do that now jesse
107:33 - yes for sure boom okay somebody says
107:37 - you could target the first by button
107:39 - first child that's also an option
107:41 - for sure that's for sure that's right so
107:43 - look we got now this portion
107:44 - you see now for some reason it's like
107:46 - very much stretching it is there a
107:47 - reason why stretching the jesse
107:50 - so i think it's actually because of the
107:52 - align item center so look if we go
107:54 - back to our uh let me go back to minus
107:57 - html
107:58 - and if we go back to our the job tile
108:01 - correct so let's go to job tile here
108:03 - yeah so if we go to job tile here and
108:06 - you can see here we have
108:07 - just my content as center and what we do
108:10 - is we do online items
108:12 - and actually going to be flex start
108:15 - or not that's not doing it as well so
108:17 - let me see so if i go to here
108:19 - if i inspect them let's take a look at
108:20 - why it's it wasn't making it so big
108:22 - right because that wouldn't make really
108:23 - make sense why is this the case
108:26 - let me see if like start uh justify
108:28 - content
108:30 - oh justify content center yeah no it
108:32 - should be
108:33 - i think flex start see
108:36 - okay so that puts at the top okay more
108:39 - space evenly
108:40 - okay but what's at the top but let's see
108:43 - why is the case
108:44 - the job tile has a certain height
108:47 - padding 30 pixels
108:49 - i actually know why i think it's also
108:50 - because because when we
108:52 - when we did flex grow so you see here
108:54 - this one
108:56 - yes right here right it says flex grow
108:59 - one
109:00 - let's remove that one for now eh you see
109:04 - and so that will make it take up only as
109:05 - much space as i can right
109:08 - let's uh let me go ahead and put back
109:10 - the grid template columns i'm just going
109:11 - to see if that
109:12 - changes anything repeats you mean yeah
109:15 - three one f r one f
109:19 - r yeah right there see so that's what
109:22 - happened so now we told okay
109:24 - so what these template rules are gonna
109:25 - do the reason why we need them now
109:27 - is because this is going to mimic
109:31 - whatever this is right so it's going to
109:34 - make sure that the width and the height
109:36 - are the same guys okay that's what we
109:37 - say grid template rows
109:39 - and this flex grow one it was kind of
109:41 - expanding to too much and it didn't
109:43 - really need to expand so we don't
109:44 - need to do flex grow one at this point
109:46 - instead we're just saying you know what
109:47 - just create three columns with three
109:49 - rows and we're all good at this point
109:50 - does that make sense guys
109:51 - all good yeah that's awesome sweet sweet
109:55 - sweet
109:55 - so we're all good at this point and then
109:57 - also so that's good i like that
109:59 - and at this point that's pretty pretty
110:00 - much it on our side
110:02 - um now that we've got look at this now
110:05 - this comes like the really really
110:07 - crazy part okay what's the crazy part
110:09 - that we're gonna work on now at this
110:10 - point what do you think jesse
110:12 - oh well we only got one
110:16 - one job that's right so we got one job
110:19 - only right now
110:20 - right but we need to get multiple jobs
110:23 - so this is where
110:24 - we now go back to script.js and we make
110:27 - it happen and we get
110:28 - fancy with this kind of stuff guys okay
110:31 - yeah we got fancy
110:32 - so nas where are we getting the data
110:35 - from
110:35 - so for these jobs because i don't think
110:38 - i wanna
110:39 - you know put all of these tiles
110:41 - hard-coded in there no we don't
110:43 - so this is where for you i mean actually
110:45 - we did a lot of research i did a lot
110:47 - we did a lot of research and like we
110:49 - kind of thought well can we use an api
110:51 - somehow and they're not not a lot of
110:52 - companies are allowed us to use apis
110:54 - unfortunately
110:55 - but what we can have is we have a json
110:57 - file that can be used for
110:59 - where you can download that will have
111:01 - all these jobs data
111:02 - so for example i'm going to give you
111:04 - guys the link right now okay
111:07 - i'll give you guys the link right now to
111:09 - that google drive folder i'm going to
111:11 - copy this link
111:12 - okay so it's going to it's this link
111:14 - right here
111:16 - boom it's this link right here and it
111:19 - has a data.json right here you see this
111:21 - one
111:21 - so i'm going to give you guys the link
111:23 - right now
111:25 - boom data just so i give you guys all
111:27 - the link okay i gave you guys all the
111:29 - link you should have the link now
111:31 - awesome sweet and those are on youtube
111:33 - we'll have the link in the description
111:34 - later on okay
111:35 - after after this uh thing so data json
111:39 - so that's good
111:40 - and then let's click on this one and
111:41 - click right click and then click

111:58 - then right click it and then click
112:00 - download awesome suite
112:02 - click download okay so that's good we
112:04 - got that portion
112:05 - okay we got that portion and now what
112:08 - you do is we need to
112:09 - import that nice yes good good can you
112:12 - send it again
112:12 - i sent you guys the link hold on right
112:15 - here
112:16 - that's just when you get the link yeah
112:18 - so now that it's done
112:19 - here's what we need to do right where do
112:22 - we have our data so we have our init.css
112:24 - or you know and so forth let's take our
112:27 - data.json
112:28 - so i'm going to take my data json right
112:30 - here my data javascript
112:32 - yeah so the data that jason guys i just
112:35 - made that file here in a visual studio
112:37 - code
112:38 - so here i okay sorry jesse
112:41 - so i basically you drag it from your
112:44 - downloads folder or whatever it would be
112:46 - put into json folder you see since jesse
112:48 - already did it
112:49 - i could just do replace go ahead and now
112:52 - we have all of our json stuff
112:53 - in there look at that right there guys
112:55 - oh so good
112:57 - so this is your jobs data
113:00 - this is what you would usually get from
113:02 - api
113:03 - right but in our case we have our own
113:06 - kind of little
113:07 - uh javascript object json objects for
113:09 - you guys to use
113:11 - so now the question might be well nas
113:12 - okay we have this data but how do we
113:14 - actually grab it
113:16 - and actually use it what do you guys
113:19 - think
113:19 - huh good question huh
113:22 - well i think you would definitely do
113:24 - that
113:28 - somebody said titles somebody says
113:31 - somebody said that this task is
113:32 - literally what react.js made for
113:33 - no not necessarily you're wrong it's
113:35 - actually what javascript is made for
113:37 - so react.js just plays on top of it
113:40 - right so
113:41 - javascript react.js right javascript is
113:43 - going to make this happen too so check
113:44 - this out
113:45 - if i go to script.js right
113:48 - if i go to this i'm going to create a
113:50 - function and this function is going to
113:51 - call be called get
113:53 - jobs right so let's do create a function
113:54 - here
113:56 - function we'll call for create get jobs
113:58 - okay
114:00 - okay so we got the function guys okay we
114:02 - got that
114:03 - awesome and we're gonna use it to call
114:05 - fetch and fetch is a way for us to get
114:07 - yeah effect is a way for us to get from
114:09 - api so we'll do fetch
114:11 - fetch and we're gonna fetch a data
114:14 - dot js from our json file
114:17 - yeah from a decent file right yeah
114:21 - it's kind of like you fashioned it from
114:22 - the api from a certain link that's right
114:24 - that's right guys
114:25 - right and um yeah and then
114:28 - we're gonna wait until we have that so
114:31 - that's why we're gonna be using dot
114:32 - then we're chaining it we're gonna wait
114:35 - for the response that comes
114:37 - out of it so basically what we can out
114:38 - of our json file okay guys
114:41 - and it's jason so we can basically
114:44 - gaze sonify it that's right okay
114:48 - that's right which brings us back
114:49 - certain data and that's the data that we
114:51 - need
114:51 - in order to use we're going to do return
114:54 - data
114:55 - but before we turn data let me go and
114:57 - console this so you guys can see what
114:58 - i'm talking about so console.log
115:01 - dialog data right and the way this kind
115:04 - of works is very simple okay guys
115:05 - look whenever we fetch is we get data
115:08 - from the api right
115:09 - then what happens is we've converted
115:10 - data to json right we convert the data
115:12 - to
115:13 - say hey you know what we're going to use
115:15 - a json object that's going to use a json
115:16 - object and then we actually get the data
115:18 - right here
115:19 - so if i go ahead and save this and i
115:22 - call this in my javascript file and i
115:24 - say
115:24 - and i say git jobs
115:27 - okay and i call it in here i call it in
115:30 - here okay
115:31 - so get jobs i call them there okay
115:33 - awesome sweet sweet sweet
115:34 - and then what's going to happen is very
115:35 - simple i'm going to inspect them but on
115:38 - this one
115:39 - inspect them on this one i go to console
115:43 - oh right there these 15
115:46 - objects all 15 objects are right there
115:49 - guys you guys see that
115:50 - you guys see that yeah isn't that cool
115:54 - right so we've got the 50 objects all in
115:57 - here if i
115:57 - if i open one object look we've got all
116:00 - the data about the specific job
116:04 - so this is where now we can get even
116:06 - fancier
116:07 - okay how do we now show these
116:10 - specific objects how do we
116:14 - show all of them so that they're all
116:16 - right here
116:18 - well you would have to loop through
116:21 - these objects
116:24 - and then access get the data from each
116:27 - object so since we know it's an object
116:31 - that means we have to access the keys
116:33 - that's right
116:34 - of this object so let's go ahead and do
116:37 - create a function called show jobs
116:41 - right and you see how i'm splitting my
116:43 - functionality into smaller functions
116:45 - okay
116:46 - show jobs right here and i'm going to
116:48 - pass in the list of jobs in here
116:51 - and now check this out right so number
116:54 - one what i'm going to do is
116:56 - i'm basically going to pass in the list
116:58 - of jobs that i'm going to get from my
116:59 - fetch
117:00 - data right now how's it going to work
117:02 - we'll check this out
117:03 - i'm going to return this fetch
117:07 - data object because this fetch actually
117:09 - returns a promise
117:11 - i know it's weird i know you guys
117:12 - haven't learned promises which is okay
117:14 - okay
117:15 - i promise kind of like you know what i
117:17 - promise that at the end
117:19 - of this at the end of today you will
117:22 - have this done that's what's happening
117:25 - this fetch is promising this function
117:28 - that you will have the data at some
117:30 - point later on
117:32 - think about it like that think about
117:34 - that way right so what's gonna happen
117:35 - here is very simple
117:37 - i'm going to say get jobs.then and this
117:39 - that then is going to be called
117:41 - only when the promise is fulfilled
117:44 - basically
117:45 - when this fetch gives us the data as
117:48 - in for example in your case guys when
117:50 - you guys finish this project at the end
117:52 - of this class
117:53 - then we'll do something right so let's
117:56 - do that
117:56 - then and really what's gonna happen is
117:59 - just then
118:00 - that's gonna get us the data and then
118:04 - look at those happening here then we're
118:06 - going to create a function
118:08 - and we'll do what we'll do show jobs
118:13 - show jobs we're going to pass in those
118:15 - jobs in here
118:17 - boom and that way i can do yeah i know
118:20 - cool right
118:21 - oh so wait and the show jobs function
118:25 - in order to show jobs that means i have
118:28 - to use
118:28 - html that's for sure plus
118:32 - this job is an array with objects
118:35 - correct
118:37 - so the show jobs function should
118:39 - actually loop through that
118:41 - and then say with each object um hey
118:44 - html i want to show this job object with
118:47 - certain properties
118:48 - oops don't want that so look if i it's
118:51 - backed up on this one now
118:53 - inspect them a console we got an error
118:56 - let's go
118:56 - ears is good jobs is not defined it's
119:00 - fine
119:00 - it's because we just present because in
119:02 - here we need to pass on data
119:04 - right you see this is data and that's
119:07 - going straight into here
119:09 - here's how it works literally it's kind
119:10 - of kind of like this let me let me show
119:12 - you guys it kind of looks like this
119:13 - it's kind of like this so it goes from
119:17 - data to this data right
119:21 - from there it gets out of the get jobs
119:24 - function
119:24 - then it goes to here
119:28 - and from there it goes to here and from
119:31 - there
119:32 - goes to here i know weird right
119:36 - and then from there it goes to here
119:39 - uh yeah you see i do understand it
119:42 - though guys because
119:44 - look read it closely step by step okay
119:47 - because on line 9
119:49 - and line 17 those are called function
119:52 - definitions okay we are defining what a
119:55 - function should be doing there
119:57 - then on line 24 that's actually the
120:00 - first step because that's where we're
120:02 - calling the get jobs function look at
120:04 - that show
120:05 - jobs jobs and show jobs exactly what we
120:08 - want
120:08 - right here guys look at that exactly so
120:11 - good so
120:12 - good i like that so we've got the jobs
120:14 - okay you guys still with me
120:15 - you guys still with me oh good beautiful
120:18 - so we've got the jobs now the question
120:19 - is how do we
120:20 - market how do we put those jobs right i
120:23 - want to just leave those jobs as a
120:24 - consult for now
120:27 - here's one thing i know and there's one
120:28 - thing i know is the following
120:30 - i know i need to put those jobs inside
120:32 - the jobs container
120:34 - so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
120:36 - grab the jobs container i'm going to say
120:38 - let jobs container
120:42 - is equal to document dot
120:45 - query selector and i'm going to get that
120:49 - jobs
120:49 - container oh that's not what i want jobs
120:53 - dash container right
120:57 - right and let's go to console log this
120:59 - one for now as well so console.log jobs
121:01 - container
121:03 - boom okay console.log that let's see
121:06 - so if i inspect them on this one again
121:11 - console so right now the container is
121:13 - null because i think createselector.jobs
121:16 - container right here
121:17 - jobs container do it again a you see
121:20 - this right here e
121:21 - yeah very good that's right there right
121:23 - so we got that document
121:25 - and this is where we need to replace the
121:27 - html guys
121:28 - so let's go ahead for do this first yeah
121:30 - no i know wait right
121:32 - so let's create an empty so literally
121:34 - we're creating html now
121:35 - inside javascript listen this
121:38 - we have jobs.html is equal to an empty
121:42 - string for now
121:43 - for now it's empty string right and then
121:45 - what we're going to do is
121:46 - we're going to loop through every single
121:48 - job that we get from here
121:51 - look for physical job we get from here
121:52 - that's right
121:54 - right so we'll do four each we're gonna
121:56 - for each job let's go ahead and create a
121:57 - function for this one
121:59 - right and then we'll do something now at
122:01 - this point so let's go ahead and console
122:03 - log the job for now so to console the
122:05 - log
122:08 - the log each job okay
122:12 - right and if i recognize inspect them on
122:13 - this one
122:16 - look at this see this is every job
122:18 - literally every job that we have is
122:20 - right here
122:21 - exactly right so we got that oh
122:24 - i know that also means what is one of
122:28 - the keys that also means if i do
122:29 - console.log
122:37 - oops not local storage logo storage logo
122:41 - what is logo console
122:45 - right now logo is gonna look at that
122:46 - these are all the logos for every single
122:48 - job you see right there
122:49 - right there right there right there
122:52 - awesome
122:52 - awesome so now look at what we do guys i
122:55 - want you to pay attention to this really
122:56 - quick really closely
122:58 - go to index.html every single job tile
123:02 - we're going to copy the whole job tile
123:06 - right because that's what we want to
123:08 - repeat is you want to repeat
123:09 - every job tile for every job comprende
123:13 - right that's right like like just doing
123:15 - it
123:16 - [Music]
123:18 - right so copy every job yeah
123:21 - go to script that source and here's what
123:23 - we're going to do
123:25 - i'm going to say jobs html
123:28 - check this out guys java's html plus
123:32 - minus remember how this was a string
123:34 - before
123:35 - i'm going to say plus equal to which is
123:37 - basically going to concatenate it
123:39 - concatenate i'm going to use back ticks
123:42 - like this so these are template strings
123:46 - okay let me kind of clean this up here
123:49 - for a second
123:50 - yep sorry i'm going to use back ticks
123:54 - like this oh my
123:55 - wait wait wait wait back takes like this
123:58 - i'm not pasting the whole thing here oh
124:02 - the whole thing the whole the whole html
124:07 - is going to be in here guys the whole
124:09 - html i'm going to
124:10 - make it just a little bit better so it's
124:12 - boom right there yeah
124:14 - okay you see the whole thing the whole
124:17 - job tile
124:18 - so now check this out we can for every
124:21 - job here's what we're doing for every
124:23 - job we'll concatenate
124:24 - this html to this job html do you guys
124:27 - see the yes or no
124:28 - right you can see that okay
124:32 - okay same section we have this job html
124:35 - i mean
124:36 - sure you guys but you can copy it from
124:37 - your guys from your site too
124:39 - so let me just do that for now i'll put
124:41 - it in the chat here
124:43 - boom that's a job html for you guys okay
124:47 - so then what's going to happen now this
124:48 - one is very very simple right we're
124:50 - going to
124:50 - go outside our for each loop let's
124:53 - console.log
124:56 - dialog the java.html so let me see the
124:59 - jobs.html let's console logo for now
125:02 - inspect element

125:12 - showing guys that's cool right all of
125:15 - html
125:17 - okay so we got that portion and here's
125:20 - what becomes smarter
125:23 - instead of using this link let's use a
125:26 - variable
125:29 - how do we get individual url for every
125:31 - single job how do we do that guys tell
125:33 - me
125:34 - what is it jesse job job so you can type
125:38 - that
125:38 - job job dot logo that logo
125:42 - save that next one instead of using this
125:46 - what do we do oops sorry um
125:50 - wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
125:51 - wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
125:52 - wait wait wait wait wait we're gonna do
125:53 - job
125:54 - dot roll name wait hold on
125:58 - go ahead now do it if you allow me go
126:00 - ahead just
126:03 - wait no i'm still wrong hold on jess
126:04 - you're still wrong wait wait wait
126:06 - it's okay it's okay you can oh we can
126:09 - always fix things
126:10 - afterwards guys don't worry okay okay
126:13 - job dot roll name pay attention guys it
126:16 - is rule name
126:17 - uh uppercase or camel case
126:20 - i mean so the second world has a second
126:22 - word it has a capital
126:24 - letter okay inside of if you you can
126:27 - check it out guys if you go back to your
126:28 - data.json file
126:30 - can you show that not
126:33 - there you see it right see first it
126:36 - starts off with a yeah
126:37 - exactly role name logo those are the
126:40 - keys of this object that we're using
126:42 - we're accessing while we're looping
126:45 - through this
126:46 - big array of objects okay so let's go
126:48 - back to our script.js
126:50 - and also for the description i'm gonna
126:53 - remove the lorem ipsum thank you very
126:56 - much
126:57 - and then dollar sign make a variable
127:01 - and say job.description
127:05 - so save that guys check this out so say
127:08 - that what we literally did is for every
127:09 - single job
127:11 - we rendered the job we created an html
127:14 - a job title html for every single job
127:16 - with a different logo
127:17 - with a different role name and a
127:19 - different description and literally that
127:20 - was it right
127:21 - and so now if i go if i can solo the
127:23 - html like
127:24 - what yeah well java description
127:28 - if you go back to the data that jason
127:32 - it's actually not the same actually
127:33 - exactly it is actually
127:35 - requirements dot content
127:39 - yeah the idea you can did is the sewing
127:42 - challenges to technology
127:46 - let's go that's what we did job
127:49 - right here javarecommerce.content guys
127:52 - okay
127:53 - the content okay awesome so we got that
127:55 - portion that's all good
127:56 - after that after that let me see that's
127:59 - it for now that's pretty much it so
128:00 - let's take a look on this one
128:04 - console.log and we'll do
128:07 - jobs.html save that one
128:11 - and then the file inspect element on
128:12 - this one
128:16 - check this out look at this current
128:18 - developer
128:19 - right right so we have all the stuff oh
128:22 - this is horrible
128:23 - right and look see different
128:26 - content for every single thing so if we
128:29 - have the html now that we need to put
128:32 - what do we do now what do we do
128:36 - well we only have the html here yeah
128:40 - we don't have it actually in our
128:43 - container let's put in the container
128:45 - because we only we only stated it here
128:47 - so we need to put this jobs html
128:49 - inside of our container jobs
128:51 - container.inner
128:52 - html is equal to jobs
128:55 - html are you ready for this are you
128:58 - ready for this my friends
129:01 - are you ready let's put it in the chat
129:04 - if you're ready
129:05 - go let's go oh
129:09 - let's go look at that
129:12 - look at that that that is so cool we
129:15 - need to fix a few things to fix this
129:16 - portion right here but that's pretty
129:17 - much it
129:18 - look at that oh
129:22 - that looks so good guys look at
129:25 - this look at that guys i want you to fix
129:27 - a little bit of the apply and the whites
129:29 - like
129:29 - it's like uh why it's like why it's like
129:32 - that but
129:33 - other than that that is awesome
129:36 - that's pretty awesome so now so we got
129:39 - this portion which is really really cool
129:41 - right here's another thing we need to do
129:46 - what are they going to do well we got
129:48 - the html we got that's working
129:50 - you see this logo this logo let's go
129:53 - ahead
129:54 - and add a border is the logo jesse right
129:56 - what is the borders for that logo
129:58 - i was thinking the exact same thing
130:02 - so border radius it's in the top section
130:04 - okay guys it's in the top section okay
130:06 - so border radius
130:11 - and then we're going to give it one of
130:13 - 10 pixel
130:14 - let's see how this looks okay it looks
130:17 - much better
130:18 - much much much much much better okay
130:21 - okay awesome so i say we save that
130:24 - and then we need to somehow for example
130:26 - put this apply now button make sure it's
130:27 - always that
130:28 - at the bottom jesse yeah how do we do
130:31 - that
130:32 - let's go to the bottom section
130:35 - let me go ahead and remove that and
130:39 - put the bottom section
130:42 - so if we write let's let i think let's
130:44 - do an inside inspect element so if i
130:46 - inspect them
130:46 - on this one let's see let's see what we
130:48 - got here because that's how i like to do
130:49 - it
130:50 - so right so if you look at our code guys
130:54 - okay our goal is is the following we
130:57 - need to make sure that this
130:58 - portion right here is always at the
131:01 - bottom right because right now it's kind
131:03 - of not
131:03 - it's kind of yeah you know right
131:07 - oh so we have to stick it
131:10 - there's the top there's a role name
131:13 - the description right there's
131:16 - buttons so all these different things
131:19 - are
131:19 - kind of there right which is great
131:22 - but the problem needs to be the fact
131:24 - that the planar button needs to be kind
131:26 - of below
131:27 - so the one thing i think we did is let
131:29 - me let me check this so the one thing
131:30 - we did is i know you had this center let
131:32 - me see if that fixes anything
131:37 - doesn't really fix doesn't really fix
131:38 - too much no jesse
131:41 - um a little bit but i think it still
131:43 - depends on the height of the description
131:45 - to be honest
131:46 - okay so we got that portion let me see
131:49 - i'm trying to understand what is the
131:50 - best way i do this
131:51 - i think what we can do is kind of like
131:55 - for the button section actually no i
131:58 - think i might have an idea
132:00 - we can also pull the buttons down to the
132:02 - edge of the
132:03 - tile description
132:06 - [Music]
132:10 - what if we do for description we do flex
132:13 - scroll
132:16 - one right there oh
132:21 - hey yeah that's oh yeah yeah
132:24 - okay that makes sense to do that yeah
132:27 - right there you see
132:27 - yeah so guys let's see let's let's
132:31 - show you for real okay so
132:34 - like this okay
132:37 - that way you can really see what's
132:39 - happening right so let me let me go to
132:41 - show the code guys okay let me show you
132:43 - guys the code
132:44 - so let's go back to description right
132:46 - here
132:49 - okay so as you can see now this is all
132:53 - like this it's all changing right it's
132:54 - all weird but if we give this a flex
132:57 - grow
132:58 - so it can get all of the space that it
133:00 - needs yeah
133:02 - it always is going to push basically
133:05 - this to the bottom you see that's what's
133:07 - going to happen guys it's all going to
133:09 - push
133:10 - at the bottom to the bottom which will
133:11 - make the button is always the bottom do
133:13 - you see that right there
133:14 - you guys see that yes yes yes everybody
133:16 - good
133:17 - good good good so that's kind of how we
133:19 - make it work right it's i know
133:20 - it's a little cool things like that that
133:22 - make things really really happen and
133:23 - make things so simple guys right
133:26 - right awesome sweet so i kind of like
133:28 - that one thing i'm really curious why is
133:29 - the apply now button is
133:31 - jumping up and down that's so weird let
133:33 - me see so let me go inspect them on this
133:34 - apply now button
133:37 - so right click on this one inspect them
133:39 - on this button
133:40 - so apply now space between this is good
133:45 - display flex margin top
133:47 - do we have in the apply now button
133:51 - we also have this background color
133:55 - align item center which is great
133:58 - i want to understand why it's not
134:00 - chi-chi to true
134:02 - that's so weird is it because when we're
134:05 - in the hover
134:06 - is there a hover different hover state
134:07 - for this one so let me try
134:09 - put the hover on this one so if i do
134:12 - on the hover do we change the font size
134:14 - at all no i'm just curious
134:15 - no we don't maybe it's just on my end
134:18 - though i see this
134:21 - that's interesting i don't think it's
134:23 - not like a good deal guys right
134:25 - not that big of a deal okay let's see so
134:28 - guys here's what we got we've got all of
134:31 - these
134:31 - specific things right here it's looking
134:33 - pretty pretty great we have a ui
134:35 - developer we have a freelance data data
134:37 - let's look at this
134:38 - a lot of amazing jobs so the question
134:39 - becomes is how do we go ahead
134:41 - how do we go ahead and filter these jobs
134:43 - when i go and search for something here
134:45 - how do i filter for this guys
134:48 - right how do i filter for this for this
134:50 - thing what do you guys think
134:54 - somebody said there's an issue with that
134:56 - then i don't think so you guys sure just
134:58 - make
134:58 - for the dot then make sure you guys are
135:00 - returning the fetch right here
135:02 - if you if your dot then is not working
135:04 - properly
135:05 - you need to do a return right here and
135:07 - you do the return right here
135:09 - because the data gets returned from kind
135:11 - of like here
135:12 - you see that so make sure you do that
135:14 - okay guys awesome
135:15 - we got that portion the next portion is
135:17 - gonna be the following how do we filter
135:19 - it well let's go ahead and go back to
135:20 - our script.js
135:22 - we have the jobs function we have
135:23 - everything let's go ahead and now do the
135:25 - filter jobs function guys all right
135:28 - oh the filter job that's interesting
135:32 - i know so let's go ahead what'd i just
135:35 - do
135:35 - yeah let's go ahead do that so we'll do
135:37 - function
135:39 - and we'll do filter jobs okay
135:42 - filter jobs and then so that's the font
135:45 - it's going to filter
135:46 - based on whatever we typed into here
135:47 - guys understood good
135:50 - and the filter javascript are going to
135:51 - pass in two things one is going to be
135:53 - the text we searched for so
135:55 - it's going to be the jobs which is the
135:57 - list of jobs that we can filter through
135:59 - and then the search text and this
136:02 - preference as you guys know these are
136:03 - parameters that we can pass into the
136:04 - function right because
136:06 - parameters are very important right
136:07 - these are parameters we can pass into
136:08 - the function
136:09 - okay awesome after this here's what
136:12 - we'll do
136:13 - okay let's go filter for them so here's
136:16 - what we'll say
136:18 - because the search text you need to see
136:21 - if that matches up
136:23 - with data inside of a job of course
136:26 - that's right
136:27 - that's right so so we have search text
136:30 - continue in place okay there's something
136:33 - inside the search
136:34 - search button in the search input let's
136:36 - go and filter through it so we'll do
136:38 - let filtered items
136:43 - is equal to the following so pay
136:45 - attention to this portion is really cool
136:48 - jobs dot filter that filter
136:52 - es6 has a filter function guys
136:56 - has a filter function so e6 so
136:58 - jos.filter
137:00 - and we'll do the following we'll do job
137:03 - and let's and what this allows us to do
137:05 - is this allows to figure out basically
137:06 - here
137:07 - return true here's what happens here
137:09 - return
137:10 - true if we want
137:14 - to keep this job right
137:17 - otherwise return false so basically it's
137:20 - going to go through the list of
137:21 - jobs and we're going to figure out the
137:24 - proper
137:25 - if statements to say hey which ones to
137:28 - include
137:29 - as paul part of filtered items right
137:31 - here okay or filter jobs i want to say
137:37 - filter jobs okay so let's do this we'll
137:40 - do the following we'll do
137:42 - if so here tell me guys what are some
137:44 - things we're going to check through
137:47 - when we filter the job what are some
137:48 - days we're going to check this for
137:49 - example let's say you let's say you type
137:51 - in
137:51 - the company name what do we filter what
137:54 - do we check through in that case
137:56 - inside here what do we check through
137:57 - guys what do you guys know
137:59 - tile description that's correct a sheet
138:00 - that's correct so title and description
138:02 - so we're gonna
138:03 - check through the role name right
138:06 - the type what else we're gonna check
138:08 - through
138:09 - what else we can do location as well
138:11 - that's right we can do
138:13 - content company megan says
138:16 - yes yeah we can do not id because we
138:18 - don't want to check through id guys we
138:20 - don't really know what ids ids of
138:22 - the companies are right the role name
138:26 - the company so let's do that here's what
138:29 - i'll do first
138:30 - i'm going to say if right if and this is
138:33 - going to be a big gif guys okay big gif
138:36 - if job for example dot role name
138:39 - that i'm going to convert the role name
138:41 - to lower case
138:43 - okay to lower case
138:47 - right because we're going to search
138:49 - through the lowercase portion of this
138:50 - i'm going to make this a little bit
138:51 - bigger so you guys can see
138:52 - too lower case when i check hey does
138:55 - this
138:56 - includes includes what
139:01 - search text search text so if i search
139:04 - for example for
139:05 - full time okay it's going to go through
139:08 - the role name of every single jobs
139:10 - inside here or let's just say i search
139:13 - for
139:14 - you know pekka developer i'm not sure
139:16 - what that is that's really interesting
139:17 - let's search for pekka developer i have
139:19 - no idea that it is
139:21 - but let's say i swear through it you're
139:23 - a clever developer
139:26 - exactly that's what we are hey
139:30 - right there right so if you let's say
139:32 - you stir through it it's going
139:34 - to find it's going to look for
139:37 - a job with the role name where the load
139:39 - where the role name
139:40 - matches that search text right so either
139:43 - if that's true
139:44 - or let's just say that something else is
139:46 - true or obviously or
139:48 - a job dot let's just say maybe
139:51 - the type is the same so job.type dot
139:55 - to lower case right
139:58 - that includes what the search text as
140:02 - well
140:03 - right again or or what job.type.what
140:08 - job.company right company
140:12 - dot to lowercase right
140:16 - that includes
140:19 - the search text
140:23 - or what type well i think that's about
140:27 - it
140:28 - well we have the description as well oh
140:29 - one so job
140:31 - dot if i go to my data json description
140:34 - is where inside
140:35 - the requirements that content or java
140:38 - the requirements thank you jesse
140:44 - to lowercase that includes
140:47 - search text you're right that's right
140:49 - right this is a
140:51 - humongous big if function and then we're
140:53 - going to create the brackets for that
140:54 - function
140:55 - and basically here's what it says if any
140:58 - of that stuff is true
141:02 - we will go ahead and return true
141:07 - wait wait wait wait because you started
141:10 - typing it just started
141:11 - starting to do weird things so i'm like
141:15 - it will return true right and basically
141:18 - for that job it will include that job as
141:20 - part of filtered jobs
141:21 - so for example if i go ahead let's go
141:24 - and then otherwise however
141:25 - if it does not including that stuff it
141:27 - will else
141:29 - it'll return false
141:33 - that's right between false you see
141:36 - and so this at this point we've got the
141:39 - filter jobs right here right we've got
141:40 - the voltage drops what do we do with
141:42 - those filter drops well
141:43 - we can return them so let's go and
141:45 - return
141:47 - return the filter jobs
141:50 - right there okay right however however
141:55 - here we have if there is no search text
141:57 - so if there is no search text else let's
141:59 - let's say you put nothing in the search
142:00 - text
142:01 - we're going to return all the jobs to
142:02 - you so i'm going to say all what
142:04 - else else uh return
142:09 - return the jobs that we get from here
142:12 - return jobs because we're returning now
142:15 - to filter jobs right
142:17 - now what's up we're returning to filter
142:20 - jobs
142:20 - mm-hmm right but this is still it's only
142:23 - data
142:24 - that's right that's right so
142:27 - i think we still need to make a step on
142:31 - how to
142:31 - show these filtered jobs am i correct
142:35 - that's right so let's try that so let's
142:38 - for now let's go ahead if i for example
142:40 - remember that
142:41 - guys when we filter their jobs we'll
142:43 - filter them where through here right so
142:44 - if i click on something we get our
142:46 - search text here
142:47 - so let's for example let's now actually
142:49 - try it out
142:50 - so i'm going to say let filter jobs
142:55 - right the filter jobs but actually
142:57 - before that we do we need to do get the
142:59 - job so let's
142:59 - do uh get jobs right
143:03 - dot then and hopefully this works for
143:05 - you guys too we'll do
143:07 - the jobs right

144:59 - uh what should we search for guys tell
145:01 - me what you want front end developer
145:02 - let's do
145:03 - let's do front end so we'll do front
145:08 - front end yeah fine job
145:12 - oh we got two jobs look look
145:15 - two jobs look one one from
145:18 - springbok i.t and the other one from
145:23 - michael page guys look at that
145:26 - how cool is that we just filtered
145:29 - through them
145:30 - and now since we filtered through them
145:32 - let's go ahead and show them right so
145:34 - what do we do
145:35 - so what do should we do we need to call
145:37 - in here guys what do you guys think tell
145:38 - me
145:39 - what do you think we need to call in
145:40 - here

145:44 - do you need to call in here huh
145:53 - hmm anybody nice good good good good
145:56 - show jobs show jobs
146:00 - right here and inside the show jobs
146:03 - remember the show jobs takes in a list
146:05 - of jobs so we pass in now
146:07 - the filtered ones filtered
146:12 - because before remember here when we do
146:14 - get jobs which is this gets
146:16 - this gets called when we first initiate
146:18 - our whole application right this gets
146:19 - called that right
146:20 - right exactly yeah yeah yeah so show
146:23 - jobs and then
146:24 - um we're passing in the full jobs right
146:27 - so this gets us all the jobs right here
146:29 - the first no wait wait rewind so indeed
146:32 - first we're going to be calling get jobs
146:35 - right here yes that's right
146:36 - get jobs and then we're going to pass
146:38 - the data from get
146:40 - jobs to show jobs and show jobs will
146:43 - just show
146:44 - all of the jobs at that time from the
146:46 - json file
146:47 - that's right jesse once we have filtered
146:49 - something or at least once we
146:51 - made a search input we click on a button
146:55 - find
146:55 - job that's when again get jobs
146:59 - will first be called because we're first
147:00 - going to get that whole json object
147:03 - and through there we're going to be
147:05 - filtering
147:06 - because we're calling there the filter
147:08 - jobs function indeed nas
147:11 - because we're passing there the jobs and
147:13 - the search input that's right we're
147:15 - going to get something
147:16 - back and that is being shown by using
147:19 - the show jobs function
147:21 - how cool is that guys so now how cool is
147:23 - that
147:24 - if i select front end for example let's
147:25 - just say i do front end
147:28 - right and i searched fine job oh
147:32 - look at that you see that's the
147:35 - power of having functions you see
147:38 - because this show javascript will place
147:40 - the html
147:41 - from the java whatever you pass in when
147:44 - we filter them that's we pass in
147:46 - so find out now if i empty it again
147:50 - there you go okay look how cool is that
147:53 - yeah i know right that's so cool okay
147:55 - what else for example let's go ahead and
147:57 - like for example
147:58 - let's go through maybe um
148:02 - ui device oh remote remote remote
148:10 - remote
148:13 - fine job look at that oh
148:17 - that's right sick so sick
148:21 - i love that about being a software
148:23 - developer though that i can just work
148:24 - remote the best part
148:26 - that's the best part awesome so look
148:28 - that is pretty pretty awesome so we got
148:30 - that okay look at that we got that
148:32 - now at this point we can say we're done
148:38 - but are we
148:43 - but are we done yet or no
148:49 - she said no
148:54 - not done let's make this
148:57 - more friendly oh
149:01 -  yeah
149:04 - yeah let's do it let's do it jesse
149:07 - yeah let's do it because guys what do
149:10 - you need in order to make this mobile
149:11 - friendly
149:12 - you guys know this melissa's like let's
149:15 - go it's on fire baby let's go
149:23 - [Music]
149:26 - hey all right let's add those
149:30 - media queries guys okay you just go look
149:32 - hairy baby so look let's think about
149:34 - this
149:35 - so here's what you guys to pay attention
149:36 - to when you make something mobile
149:38 - friendly
149:39 - okay let's go ahead and start minimizing
149:42 - this at which point
149:44 - do we think it is not user friendly
149:47 - anymore
149:48 - i think at this point like at around i
149:51 - think
149:51 - around a thousand a thousand pixels
149:54 - let's go and see
149:55 - so if i for example here's how we can
149:56 - test it here so
149:58 - do you guys like the way this looks
149:59 - right now or no yes or no tell me
150:01 - in the comments because his semi is very
150:05 - specific he says 960 pixel
150:07 - okay so look if i go to jazz container
150:10 - instead of doing
150:11 - so let's remove this for now okay
150:13 - instead of doing template columns
150:15 - i'm going to say instead of three let's
150:17 - just say make it with two
150:20 - yeah oh see that's a bit too that's a
150:22 - bit too large i don't like that either
150:24 - so i think it's when we get to around
150:27 - nine
150:30 - 20 see 920 pixels
150:35 - right because for example from here
150:38 - let's say it's still three for example
150:40 - let's make it three
150:42 - let's do three yeah it's still kind of
150:44 - usable it's not bad
150:46 - okay it's still kind of usable not bad
150:47 - at all okay oh
150:49 - it's very small though yeah it's okay we
150:52 - can we can always
150:52 - yeah that's still not bad right so let's
150:54 - do maybe at around what what do we say
150:57 - 920 pixels right 920 pixels or actually
151:00 - let's do 940
151:03 - and 40. so let's do 940 pixels so let's
151:06 - go to media query inside i style the css
151:08 - let's go down
151:10 - so immediate so do you have so let's go
151:12 - to media craze right here
151:19 - okay so just maybe you can help me out
151:20 - with kindle's media queries i'm getting
151:22 - the code for a second here
151:23 - yeah i'm looking it up i'm searching it

152:35 - and media screen or yeah
152:39 - that's good and here we want to do
152:42 - something about
152:43 - jobs list right so there instead of
152:47 - we have that's a grid so what we want to
152:50 - do is
152:50 - instead of having it in three columns we
152:53 - want to change it
152:54 - into two columns that's right into two

161:19 - right are there sites or somewhere that
161:22 - um are like legitimate or
161:26 - good resources in order to help me learn

161:48 - is an
161:49 - excellent um question because ninety
161:52 - percent of the time when you're coding
161:55 - you're actually debugging yeah right
161:57 - right so what i tell my students
161:59 - first of all first of all when you're
162:02 - debugging or when you have an error
162:03 - what happens is often you go sort of
162:05 - like in a panic state
162:07 - right you're like i got the error
162:12 - you go like that okay if your bug if you
162:14 - know your bug is really bad
162:16 - however okay so you got to pull yourself
162:18 - out of that emotional state first of all
162:20 - that's always my first tip
162:21 - okay i'm a performer and a middle school
162:25 - choir director
162:26 - so i'm pretty good in those situations
162:28 - like stay calm
162:29 - awesome exactly so we're gonna go into a
162:32 - problem solving modus right
162:34 - i always start with this question what
162:36 - do i know
162:38 - and what do i not know
162:41 - what do i know for sure and what do i
162:43 - not know
162:45 - that i know for sure too okay and i
162:47 - write that down
162:48 - so in your case and always for number
162:51 - one rule also
162:52 - start at the start so even though you
162:55 - know
162:56 - you have a bug somewhere in your code
162:58 - deeper in always go
162:59 - to the start where is it really and then
163:02 - that's where you're going to be logging
163:04 - so it's always with with code you know
163:06 - it's always making a hypothesis
163:09 - like if i'm logging this i'm expecting
163:11 - this is that coming out of it
163:13 - yes okay next step is that coming out of
163:15 - it yes
163:17 - oh that one is not coming out of it oh
163:19 - okay i need to go back
163:21 - yeah back up a little bit so that's how
163:22 - it goes
163:24 - and it's really it's a skill you know to
163:26 - keep your head
163:27 - um level to keep yourself level-headed
163:30 - to stay calm under a deadline
163:32 - to be fast at solving it resources
163:36 - that's all part of it yeah okay so if
163:39 - you're
163:39 - being challenged by this and you're
163:41 - seeing yourself like
163:42 - oh my god i'm at this stage
163:45 - congratulations
163:46 - you're doing an excellent job because
163:48 - you're growing as a person as a
163:50 - developer
163:50 - so i want that to stand out to everybody
163:53 - if you're having trouble
163:54 - doing that but you're you have solved
163:57 - something
163:58 - you should celebrate that's
164:00 - right okay you should celebrate
164:04 - you should go so that said megan what is
164:07 - a good what are good resources well
164:09 - you got to go step by step um and
164:13 - to be honest i use for example a few
164:16 - bible or
164:17 - like a cheat sheet so w3schools
164:20 - mdn mozilla free code
164:24 - free code camp and also people kind of
164:27 - underestimate this as a developer
164:28 - i don't know it's because i did a career
164:30 - situation i learned things different
164:32 - but i write things down even about my
164:36 - code like hey
164:37 - what what is actually happening here how
164:40 - did i
164:40 - how did i go how did i go to see if i
164:42 - started a
164:44 - well i have to pass b right so where
164:47 - where's my b
164:47 - at so i am trying to retrace and
164:50 - backtrack
164:51 - my logic does this help for you okay
164:54 - yeah that that makes sense so more of a
164:56 - flow chart so
164:57 - because because it's a lot there's so
164:59 - many streams of logic that it's hard to
165:01 - figure out which stream of logic
165:03 - is right particular bug and so that
165:06 - makes sense to have a flow chart
165:07 - yeah so it kind of yeah figure out where
165:10 - in the stream i went wrong
165:11 - exactly so especially with this job
165:13 - search right always start at the start
165:15 - so what is the story
165:17 - a user pops in he or she puts something
165:20 - into the
165:21 - input presses the find button
165:25 - which function gets fired office first
165:28 - okay
165:29 - the get jobs function okay get jobs
165:32 - function what does it get jobs to do
165:35 - that's the filter jobs function filter
165:38 - jobs function
165:39 - oh i got the filter jobs hey now we're
165:42 - going to show
165:42 - jobs show jobs function yeah so
165:46 - that is your logic and then
165:49 - that is so from there you're going to
165:51 - micromanage okay what's happening inside
165:53 - of those functions and how can i console
165:55 - log
165:56 - certain results okay so i'm because i
165:59 - think
166:00 - my mind is i'm debugging it like in html
166:02 - where i'm taking like this division or
166:04 - this section and trying to
166:06 - and that actually makes more sense where
166:08 - it's debugged by function
166:09 - yeah and then it's going to make more
166:12 - sense with each
166:13 - okay yeah that actually feels very
166:16 - helpful that
166:18 - turned on the light bulb yeah yeah so
166:20 - it's a function but it's also the user
166:22 - story
166:22 - i always go back to what's the goal of
166:24 - your app
166:25 - the goal of your app is actually the
166:27 - goal of your code guys
166:29 - the goal of your app is a solution right
166:32 - so i always start like what is my goal
166:34 - why why am i doing this and i i actually
166:37 - just sometimes
166:38 - i'm also overwhelmed right i just start
166:39 - at the start and i just start reasoning
166:42 - yeah and that's when i find out things
166:44 - actually i don't remember
166:45 - i don't memorize everything to be honest
166:47 - i don't
166:48 - i do have a pretty good memory but i
166:51 - don't memorize it because i just go
166:52 - through things to a certain workflow
166:54 - so it's just practice okay debugging is
166:56 - a learnable skill don't forget that
166:58 - yeah don't forget that okay yeah it's
167:00 - it's like kind of like
167:02 - jesse said it really is practice and
167:04 - like megan how long have you been doing
167:05 - javascript now just curious
167:07 - okay so i'm gonna tell on myself agree
167:11 - in communication technology in 2005.
167:14 - okay and i have not coded since
167:18 - really i have been teaching middle
167:20 - school and so we'll bring you
167:21 - go ahead and and this was back in the
167:23 - day where notebook was the only editor
167:26 - no way no book notepad like we literally
167:30 - html and css i'm used to doing that and
167:33 - figuring out those bugs
167:35 - okay but javascript is another animal
167:38 - that yeah i'm just trying to i'm tr i'm
167:42 - i think i'm trying to treat it too much
167:43 - like html and cms css
167:46 - yeah and i have to debug it differently
167:49 - and i got to tell you i'm in love with
167:51 - these editors that like pop things in
167:53 - for you like
167:53 - awesome that's awesome and honestly
167:57 - though
167:57 - i think for you right because i know
167:59 - you're trying to debug stuff right
168:01 - i think for you you kind of want to go
168:03 - more to the beginning
168:05 - like okay all right now i think for you
168:06 - it's not so much about the debugging
168:08 - it's so much about
168:09 - knowing the fundamentals of javascript
168:11 - right right and that's what i'm saying i
168:13 - don't know where to go
168:14 - yeah that's a legitimate source to step
168:17 - me through like the very basics of
168:18 - this is how a function flows that's
168:20 - right that's right right
168:22 - so so there's a few resources okay so
168:24 - the fundamentals guys are the most
168:26 - important things
168:27 - so free code camp has a lot of amazing
168:29 - fundamentals right
168:30 - it's a free resource for you guys to use
168:32 - literally go to free code and then i
168:33 - think it's a section called like web
168:34 - developer and there's like a section for
168:36 - like javascript
168:37 - you know section for that so just type
168:39 - in basics and you will get a bunch of
168:41 - answers and they'll literally go through
168:42 - like the most
168:43 - basic stuff you can actually learn right
168:45 - so that's very important right
168:47 - so free code game is great um we also
168:49 - have a lot a javascript crash course on
168:51 - youtube
168:52 - completely free as well right right so
168:54 - there's some really good resources there
168:56 - um like i said there's a lot of
168:59 - tutorials a lot of tutorials out there
169:01 - you know for you guys to learn the basic
169:02 - javascript stuff
169:03 - tomorrow you know i'll mention this as
169:05 - well tomorrow is always you guys will
169:06 - i'm not sure if you're
169:08 - interested potentially enjoying our
169:09 - coding boot camp that's what we teach
169:11 - you guys as well we teach you guys the
169:12 - fundamentals as well so there'll be
169:13 - a chance for you guys to see if you're
169:15 - potentially if you you might want to do
169:17 - something like that too
169:18 - right that will be tomorrow but yeah on
169:21 - the free side i think it's a free code
169:23 - kiln one
169:24 - um the youtube one youtube was great
169:27 - um and that's your guys's youtube right
169:30 - yeah that's another thing is when you
169:32 - search there's like 50 bazillion yeah
169:35 - i know some of these might be junk i
169:37 - don't know
169:38 - i know we have a javascript crash course
169:40 - literally it's called a little josh
169:42 - it's literally eight hours long
169:45 - oh i'm somebody just put it in the chat
169:47 - yeah i'm gonna open yeah that's great
169:49 - thank you so much hours long megan okay
169:52 - and
169:52 - okay that's but most importantly make it
169:55 - is you want to a little bit
169:56 - that you want those fundamentals you
169:57 - want to get those down really really
169:59 - well
170:00 - right yeah don't rush yourself into too
170:02 - many crazy things like
170:03 - please don't go into react js right now
170:06 - please don't
170:07 - the biggest mistake that a lot of people
170:08 - make you know
170:11 - so guys if you've been doing react js
170:14 - without having fundamental knowledge in
170:16 - javascript
170:18 - i will come looking for you she will
170:20 - come and hide you she'll hunt you down
170:23 - so yeah that's the most important and
170:25 - then after you learn some of the mentos
170:27 - as you learned it start applying that
170:28 - kind of stuff
170:29 - because when you start learning this
170:31 - kind of stuff on the tutorial section
170:32 - you might find yourself in the tutorial
170:34 - hell
170:35 - portion so yeah so make sure you don't
170:38 - get
170:38 - that far you know towards that so learn
170:41 - the fundamentals
170:43 - start building projects some kind of
170:45 - projects with those fundamentals
170:46 - and then you can kind of level up to the
170:48 - next section
170:50 - even if they're just like
170:53 - completely like useless just for fun
170:57 - projects just build something that
170:58 - applies that skill
171:00 - 100 yes yes because that's what you do
171:02 - as developers
171:03 - is you we're just building stuff right
171:05 - and so right now
171:06 - like you like think about it ask any
171:09 - developer right now
171:10 - who's probably like who's seen our stuff
171:12 - before right
171:14 - i talk to a lot of people so does jesse
171:17 - a lot of developers and the pattern goes
171:19 - like this
171:20 - a lot of our students will watch a lot
171:22 - of tutorials
171:23 - they will build the projects they've got
171:26 - the amazing react.js projects they've
171:28 - got the amazon clone and the uber clone
171:30 - and the netflix store and then whatever
171:32 - clone and then me clone whatever it's
171:33 - gonna be
171:35 - you know they can't apply it to anything
171:37 - else no they can't
171:39 - okay when i that's not what i want i
171:41 - want to actually understand what i'm
171:42 - doing
171:43 - because the whole point is not to build
171:45 - a project the point is
171:46 - to understand how to build it yes
171:50 - yeah you're on the money let me give
171:52 - this to you yeah
171:54 - exactly you run the money on this one so
171:57 - that's what you focus on is those
171:58 - fundamentals the answers
172:00 - does that make sense yes yes that does
172:03 - and once you've got once you've got the
172:05 - fundamentals that's why for example we
172:07 - teach like fundamentals so much like for
172:09 - example
172:09 - you know we teach like and we teach
172:11 - crazy fundamentals literally for two
172:13 - months straight
172:14 - i we have i have students who come in
172:16 - with like react js knowledge
172:18 - right and i teach the fundamentals so
172:20 - you're like they're like
172:21 - oh is this really what javascript
172:24 - is you know
172:25 - like everything like two months of it
172:28 - which is like literally
172:29 - variables functions right we do crazy
172:31 - stuff like
172:32 - stacks queues data structures you know
172:35 - algorithms
172:36 - all just fundamentals
172:40 - okay yeah that's what i want you're
172:42 - getting so good at that
172:44 - yeah that it's kind of like when you for
172:46 - example you know
172:47 - you know like when you're learning a new
172:49 - language right and you learn those
172:50 - fundamental things in the language right
172:52 - then other stuff just becomes easier
172:54 - right yes
172:56 - 100 like i said i teach music
173:02 - first once you understand those
173:04 - fundamentals and you can put them
173:06 - together in a million different ways the
173:08 - rest of it's just like
173:09 - it doesn't matter what it is you just
173:11 - know how to fit
173:12 - how they fit together exactly that's it
173:15 - okay
173:15 - so i need to go back to learning quarter
173:17 - notes yeah
173:19 - yeah so when it comes to code indeed you
173:22 - actually gotta
173:23 - look at the code and be like hey which
173:25 - tone is this
173:26 - yeah c d f e or which is a minor or is
173:31 - it a major
173:32 - or you know approaching like that yeah
173:35 - awesome okay okay the help up thank you
173:38 - yes that got it yes very much thank you
173:41 - are we gonna see you tomorrow 11 pst
173:44 - absolutely okay let's do it okay thank
173:46 - you thank you megan
173:49 - okay hi back get a question
173:52 - wait hold on back hi back how are you
173:55 - doing wait there's there's two people
173:56 - hold on back go ahead back
174:00 - i can't hear you i love you guys ah
174:03 - thank you we love you too
174:07 - well okay no i think i watched one of
174:09 - your videos last night
174:11 - okay and you mentioned that as long as
174:13 - you get like the fundamentals of
174:15 - math or something
174:19 - that i mean it's like
174:22 - i have something called math character
174:24 - how about math disorder i can't remember
174:26 - the numbers
174:27 - school back in my school math
174:32 - don't worry i cannot i can also i said i
174:35 - said fundamentals of javascript maybe
174:38 - back okay because
174:42 - isn't that a part of the logic part of
174:45 - learning javascript and
174:47 - all these other things that i want to
174:49 - learn
174:50 - no i can use a calculator
174:54 - yes well if you need to calculate
174:58 - something
174:58 - with numbers you can use a calculator
175:01 - but you don't need
175:02 - you don't need to calculate anything
175:06 - you don't need math back i have i had a
175:10 - student
175:10 - i had a student it's so funny i had a
175:12 - student who was actually
175:14 - um he was learning math to get into
175:17 - coding
175:19 - i'm like what are they doing like why
175:22 - are you doing that
175:24 - like yeah because you know you need to
175:26 - know math i'm like
175:28 - no you don't because if you think more
175:30 - realistically
175:32 - go ahead back no i was just gonna ask
175:34 - why why don't you
175:35 - need to know at least like basic math
175:38 - well let me ask you this
175:40 - today did we use math
175:45 - yeah really
175:49 - i mean i can do like percentages and if
175:51 - it's got something to do with money then
175:52 - i'm all on it but other than that
175:55 - no no
175:58 - did we use did you need to be a
176:00 - full-time programmer doing that
176:02 - did we use math lab yesterday
176:06 - i was so confused yesterday i ain't even
176:08 - gonna lie but i wasn't feeling good
176:10 - neither so
176:11 - that hinders my brain sometimes so um
176:15 - we didn't use math yesterday either but
176:17 - yes
176:19 - marcus said we did use minus n
176:22 - plus one oh okay sorry we use
176:25 - subtraction and we use addition
176:30 - algebraic ends and
176:33 - so all right so the ends don't worry so
176:35 - much about that the
176:36 - end stuff that's like we don't use that
176:38 - too much at all like the
176:40 - main thing you need to understand is
176:41 - like okay like
176:43 - in math yes subtraction addition
176:45 - multiplication division
176:47 - you know that kind of stuff you need to
176:49 - know but honestly
176:51 - apart from that that's pretty much it
176:54 - honestly
176:56 - apart from that like you would need to
176:58 - most importantly need to learn is like
177:00 - how do you loop through an array
177:01 - how to loop in a list like you need to
177:03 - understand like what is a variable and
177:05 - how is the variable stored in a computer
177:08 - right like that stuff is a lot more
177:10 - valuable than knowing how to do
177:11 - logarithms
177:14 - you know what i mean it isn't
177:19 - wait don't y'all teach the uh so
177:22 - can i ask you a question algorithms
177:26 - we do yes what oh okay why was the word
177:29 - algorithm
177:30 - no no i said i said logarithms log
177:35 - right but when i hear algorithms which i
177:37 - think you all see from the
177:38 - the camp right yeah i think math
177:42 - and that i mean not math
177:46 - it's not math it's not math no it's not
177:48 - math at all
177:50 - algorithms yes it includes some like
177:52 - addition multiple like stuff like that
177:54 - but algorithms is actually about
177:57 - using logic and different data
178:01 - structures so for example math is about
178:03 - okay addition subtraction getting things
178:06 - together
178:06 - removing things it's about solving
178:09 - a problem it's about solving like for
178:11 - example how do i get to a certain number
178:13 - right
178:14 - like that's that's what math is about
178:15 - it's about how do i get to a certain
178:17 - number
178:18 - right with yeah with
178:22 - algorithms it's actually about how do i
178:24 - produce certain results that looks
178:26 - in a certain way
178:31 - right so for example a lot of times for
178:34 - example you might have like
178:35 - maybe for example in an algorithm for
178:36 - example for example
178:38 - in algorithms there is a simple
178:42 - uh thing we do for example which is like
178:45 - um
178:45 - you have a matrix a matrix is basically
178:48 - like
178:48 - a in multiple rows of arrays right you
178:50 - have a matrix of that
178:52 - and you want to think about okay and i
178:54 - want to get a diagonal difference
178:55 - between the whole matrix
178:58 - i know it's probably like weird right
179:00 - now right but what is that there no
179:01 - difference it's basically you have a
179:02 - matrix that goes like this
179:05 - and your goal is to be able to loop
179:08 - through the matrix in a way
179:09 - where you can get the sum of the numbers
179:12 - that you have the one diagonal
179:14 - the sum of another diagonal and subtract
179:17 - them they'll sum
179:18 - and subtract the sum
179:22 - you see okay that's an algorithm you see
179:25 - for example another algorithm might be
179:26 - for example hey you know what to create
179:27 - a recursive function that will print out
179:29 - fibonacci numbers
179:32 - now fibonacci is actually part of math
179:34 - you guys know fibonacci right
179:35 - yeah so fibonacci is basically like
179:38 - it's like it's like a built up stack so
179:40 - for example for example let's just say
179:42 - you have number one and three
179:44 - the next fibonacci number is one plus
179:46 - two which is four
179:48 - the one after that is going to be three
179:50 - plus four which is seven
179:52 - but for that it's going to be four plus
179:53 - seven which is going to be 11.
179:55 - so you see where and the the last two
179:57 - numbers we're adding them together does
179:58 - that make sense
180:01 - so and we and so that's what algorithms
180:04 - are about
180:06 - math we don't use much of that
180:09 - right we use a lot more logic behind
180:12 - hey how do you use an array hey how to
180:15 - use a binary tree okay
180:16 - and how do we create a certain result
180:19 - you know
180:20 - using that binary tree you know what i
180:22 - mean stuff like that
180:26 - so i'm scared for nothing yeah you're
180:28 - scared for nothing
180:34 - well good thing relieves your scaredness
180:37 - yeah yeah because
180:40 - yeah it's not it's not math back it's
180:44 - like
180:44 - i i have i have students who no idea
180:46 - what like like
180:47 - math like are you kidding me like what
180:52 - is your what is your background back
180:54 - if i may ask what did you did you study
180:56 - anything or what's your current job
180:57 - currently i am on disability right now
181:01 - and i desperately want to get off from
181:03 - it um
181:05 - but i've went i've got some college
181:07 - courses behind me
181:08 - but um i haven't really worked except
181:11 - for my ex-husband
181:13 - in the last 20 years um gotcha
181:17 - okay okay okay
181:20 - gotcha so yeah so look math is not the
181:23 - most important thing for you honestly
181:25 - you just want to focus on learn those
181:27 - fundamentals of javascript
181:29 - okay learn fundamentals start to build
181:31 - that logic and just start building stuff
181:32 - because coding is about building
181:34 - you're a builder that's who you are
181:35 - you're a builder back
181:37 - yeah and a creator like the creator said
181:40 - yesterday
181:40 - yeah and the creator um and so that's
181:44 - part go ahead no i was just going to
181:46 - tell megan
181:47 - to go to y'all's website there is a like
181:50 - a mini bootcamp
181:52 - of html or something that's
181:56 - uh javascript or something
181:59 - that i got into oh the prophet
182:02 - saws yeah yeah okay awesome well not not
182:05 - just that one but there was like
182:07 - there's a free thing that i got into oh
182:09 - yeah okay
182:10 - yeah i'm like okay
182:14 - i don't know about it but that's awesome
182:16 - man either i found it
182:17 - earlier okay okay so go check it out
182:20 - girl come out of program.com
182:22 - it's all there
182:25 - awesome did you were you less confused
182:28 - today was that
182:28 - they will say a little better yes
182:32 - okay oh but what can we use like well i
182:35 - don't know what like an api
182:36 - is really i mean i know the concept of
182:39 - it but i don't know
182:40 - how to like apply it or anything so i
182:41 - know you so i know i know you join
182:43 - profit javascript your learning api is
182:45 - there
182:45 - but an apis is called application
182:48 - application interface it's an
182:49 - application program interface
182:50 - and it's kind of like for example think
182:52 - about like this
182:54 - right when you for example it's when you
182:57 - for example
182:59 - um how did i say this when you order
183:02 - something
183:03 - on amazon right
183:07 - how do you think amazon knows about your
183:09 - order
183:11 - the computer tells it yeah a computer
183:13 - tells it but tells what
183:14 - tells to who to the provider
183:19 - then no necessarily yeah but how does
183:22 - that work
183:23 - that's right but how does that work out
183:24 - how where's the bridge between you
183:26 - and the factory that's where the api
183:28 - would come in at yeah
183:29 - right okay why couldn't
183:33 - we find does not like indeed or monster
183:36 - or
183:37 - last door do they not provide api
183:40 - they eat or we can make our own little
183:42 - desktop and not always have to go to
183:44 - their
183:44 - thing that's what i was thinking yeah so
183:47 - they don't provide apis because they
183:48 - want to keep the data for themselves
183:50 - and it makes sense right they want to
183:51 - release it to everybody oh yeah yeah so
183:53 - api
183:54 - will allow you guys a public api will
183:56 - allow everybody to use their data
183:58 - unfortunately we don't have that so we
183:59 - couldn't use that right so
184:01 - and yeah so i i kept i kept trying to
184:03 - search for different apis i just
184:04 - couldn't find any
184:05 - honestly but yeah there are companies
184:06 - that have apis there's a there's a
184:08 - weather apis a bunch of weather apis
184:10 - there's a bunch of different guys that
184:11 - you can like public ones that you can
184:13 - use that give you like free data to use
184:17 - okay like search up free public apis
184:21 - and then you'll see on google well i
184:24 - know about like the the weather ones
184:26 - and um there's a couple other ones that
184:29 - i've
184:30 - seen earlier because i have this idea
184:33 - of something that i want to make and it
184:36 - involves apis oh that's awesome okay so
184:39 - um
184:41 - um would like instagram and
184:44 - youtube do they have like aps
184:48 - oh youtube does youtube does
184:55 - okay you got it awesome back
184:59 - awesome are we gonna see you tomorrow
185:01 - back oh yes ma'am
185:05 - thank you awesome back all right we'll
185:07 - see you tomorrow okay back
185:08 - thank you all right i'm not going to
185:10 - where i don't want to see one of the
185:11 - questions
185:12 - you never know where i can learn okay
185:14 - okay
185:15 - awesome how are you doing how are you
185:17 - doing sit lana
185:18 - go ahead feel free to ask a question
185:20 - right here
185:22 - oh so many ladies hi hi julana
185:26 - how are you i'm fine how are you it was
185:29 - great today
185:30 - i i really enjoyed the your program
185:33 - there
185:33 - that's awesome thank you glad you
185:35 - enjoyed it you have a question do you
185:37 - have a question for us
185:38 - yes i do have a question uh my question
185:40 - is
185:41 - um okay i was uh it's actually from my
185:44 - job
185:45 - i used to work in the company which is
185:49 - e-commerce and they had the book honors
185:52 - based uh website and i was making a lot
185:56 - of
185:56 - product pages and all that where
186:05 - so but it wasn't wasn't my setup it was
186:08 - the setup of lead developer who
186:11 - just needed help someone to help him
186:13 - with them without
186:15 - product pages and all that okay which is
186:17 - which is not coding at all
186:19 - okay so the question was from uh my job
186:22 - or from from the bus from my previous
186:24 - job
186:26 - is it possible to create a website let's
186:28 - say in html or
186:30 - any kind of uh you know as a platform a
186:33 - hard coded website where people can put
186:36 - products in the
186:37 - in the basket and and then that
186:40 - fulfillment goes the basket the entire
186:43 - thing that is in the basket
186:44 - goes to that woocommerce store
186:48 - that company owns let's say if i want to
186:51 - clear
186:52 - create an affiliate website and
186:55 - uh that has a calculator let's say how
186:58 - much
186:58 - energy do i need to spend uh
187:02 - do i spend during the summer time and
187:04 - how much solar power do i need how much
187:07 - battery do i need for
187:10 - um for my solar setup
187:13 - and let's say people would use that
187:15 - calculator on my website
187:17 - right uh they would calculate let's say
187:19 - it would come
187:20 - up to several batteries of certain kind
187:24 - and that information would go directly
187:27 - in that
187:27 - that's uh in the my cart on
187:30 - my website would be stored in in cash
187:33 - and
187:34 - also this information would be would go
187:36 - directly to book honors
187:38 - and where people would
187:41 - you basically check out their purchase
187:45 - okay so so so okay so i understand what
187:47 - you're saying so you're saying basically
187:48 - you have a website let's just say it's
187:50 - your own website it's an affiliate
187:51 - website
187:52 - what just happened here oh you have an
187:54 - affiliate website right
187:55 - right and it and it's let's say that
187:58 - what let's say the domain of that
187:59 - website is
188:00 - website let's just say that so your
188:01 - domain correct right you have another
188:04 - website that's a woocommerce website is
188:06 - that right another one
188:07 - and that one is for example is like
188:09 - celana's woocommerce let's just say
188:11 - that's another domain correct
188:12 - right so there's two different domains
188:14 - right
188:15 - one is a woocommerce one one is a
188:17 - landing page just for you
188:18 - correct right okay and so you're trying
188:21 - to do is that for example when i when
188:23 - somebody clicks
188:24 - add to cart right on your website
188:27 - it adds to cart on your website and also
188:29 - on the woocommerce is that what is that
188:30 - what's going to do
188:32 - uh it actually in a cut on my website
188:35 - and that information is sent
188:36 - to the cart of that woocommerce the the
188:39 - main website
188:41 - that does the main checkout function
188:45 - so basically the i'm just an accommodate
188:48 - and
188:48 - the uh the owner of the website of the
188:52 - woocommerce website
188:53 - is uh is the one who gets
188:56 - you know who sells the product and i
188:59 - let's say as a affiliate i provide
189:01 - websites that
189:03 - let's say uh provide let's say
189:05 - calculations for your recipe or
189:07 - calculations for
189:08 - whatever that you need to build a setup
189:11 - who it yourself set up and it would uh
189:15 - send the all this information of the
189:17 - products let's say my website would say
189:20 - uh sell or suggest certain products
189:25 - and uh that is stored
189:28 - let's say a customer a user checks out
189:31 - all those
189:32 - you know all those products through my
189:34 - setup
189:35 - that i make on my own website and
189:38 - then this information from the cache was
189:41 - directly in the part of that book owners
189:44 - uh and uh the the oil checkout sink
189:48 - is in woocommerce uh not on your side
189:50 - romanian website
189:52 - where they process all their purchasing
189:55 - for all the clients for all the users
189:58 - but my website is an affiliate website
190:00 - it doesn't sell anything
190:02 - but it lets the users to select the
190:05 - products
190:06 - and then check out the actual purchase
190:09 - of those products that are
190:10 - already collected in a cart and that
190:13 - cart is being transferred
190:15 - to that book honors and then it's been
190:18 - processed in the website
190:19 - on on that main website that was a
190:22 - question of my boss at my previous job
190:24 - that i couldn't answer
190:26 - but i don't work there anymore but
190:29 - however for myself i would like to know
190:31 - how to do that because that's a way
190:33 - that's a very interesting uh thing
190:36 - to do yeah yeah so
190:40 - so i've really enough i i i haven't used
190:42 - woocommerce but i have used a different
190:44 - e-commerce
190:45 - application before um so
190:49 - because there's two domains it gets
190:51 - really hard to
190:52 - communicate between two of them right so
190:54 - it becomes really because there's two
190:55 - domains it's like two different websites
190:56 - like having two different houses okay
190:59 - um so the only way you could do that
191:02 - where you have
191:03 - the product on one site
191:06 - and the checkout on another site
191:10 - is if you if woocommerce actually gives
191:13 - you an api to use
191:18 - so woocommerce i'm not sure if they do
191:20 - or not
191:21 - but if they have an api where for
191:23 - example you can send information to that
191:25 - website
191:27 - and it will populate the data based on
191:30 - what the url is for example because
191:33 - the url can have a lot of data in there
191:37 - so so here's how it looks like for
191:38 - example let's say you have
191:41 - let's say let's just say this okay so
191:42 - yes it's possible it's possible
191:44 - so let's just say that you for example
191:47 - have
191:47 - you know you have your cart on your site
191:49 - right and it has a list of products
191:52 - and every product has an id like a a
191:54 - barcode right
191:55 - it's a it's an id a number right when
191:58 - you click
191:58 - checkout the url
192:02 - of the checkout will take you to the
192:03 - woocommerce site right
192:05 - yes but the url will also have the data
192:09 - of the ids
192:10 - that are in your cart
192:13 - so we'll have for example for example
192:15 - let's just say your woocommerce site is
192:17 - called
192:18 - setlana's commerce let's just say that
192:21 - right
192:22 - so the slide will look like this it will
192:23 - be so when you click checkout it will
192:25 - take you to svetlana's commerce.com
192:28 - yes question mark
192:31 - products equals and then you have all
192:34 - the ids of those
192:35 - products
192:42 - and the use of products and then on the
192:45 - woocommerce site
192:46 - you will have to install some kind of
192:48 - cost to customization
192:50 - you will have to do some kind of
192:51 - customization to where you will look at
192:53 - those ids in the url
192:55 - and you will populate the cart based on
192:58 - those ids
193:02 - so is it possible yes does it require
193:05 - some custom
193:06 - custom coding yes
193:12 - it's almost like for example you are
193:16 - it's like for example let's say you have
193:17 - two different houses right
193:19 - and then let's say you just you um
193:23 - let's say for example you have some
193:24 - recipes right let's say the first house
193:27 - has
193:28 - the ingredients the second house is
193:31 - going to use those
193:31 - ingredients to actually do something
193:33 - with them and actually cook
193:34 - so what you will do is of course is you
193:36 - will go over you will walk you will take
193:38 - the ingredients into a basket
193:40 - right and you you will walk out to the
193:42 - next house the next house will take
193:43 - those ingredients and they will actually
193:45 - make something out of that right
193:46 - right that's literally what you're doing
193:48 - is in the url
193:50 - is you're putting the ingredients in
193:51 - there in the url
193:53 - which the ingredients are the ideas of
193:56 - the products themselves
194:01 - does that make sense it makes a lot of
194:04 - sense thank you so much
194:05 - you got it but this that does require
194:07 - custom coding
194:11 - but in coding pretty much anything is
194:14 - possible
194:17 - i mean except a few things would like to
194:19 - learn how to do that and i would like to
194:21 - make that project happen do it do it
194:23 - make it happen
194:24 - make it happen i think it's really
194:25 - really cool it's a really cool it's a
194:27 - really cool um
194:28 - yeah it's a really really cool problem
194:30 - to solve i like that
194:32 - i like problems like that thank you
194:35 - thank you
194:35 - awesome did you enjoy did you enjoy the
194:37 - past few days yes oh
194:38 - yes a lot
194:40 - [Laughter]
194:44 - are we able to change were you here and
194:46 - were you able to build the projects too
194:48 - yes yes i was following along i was
194:50 - building the pro
194:51 - projects the only reason i didn't submit
194:53 - my coffee shop is because
194:55 - i want to turn it into the e-commerce
194:57 - for my own
194:58 - product oh my god
195:02 - gotcha gotcha awesome well nexus we'll

195:29 - look at that smile wow no
195:33 - three questions oh my three questions
195:35 - let's go let's do two let's do two
195:37 - questions
195:39 - pick two best questions
195:43 - okay first i want to say uh i'm so
195:45 - excited
195:46 - from the beginning of this bootcamp
195:49 - thank you i love you
195:50 - guys love you jesse i love your
195:53 - motivation
195:54 - thank you so much okay my first
195:58 - question is before this bootcamp i
196:02 - entered a beginner bootcamp i learned
196:06 - the basis and now in javascript i use
196:11 - angular framework
196:15 - is angular is uh good and should i
196:18 - continue in this or i have to
196:22 - change to react library or
196:25 - use another one so now i'm confused what
196:28 - are you what are you using angular for
196:33 - what are you using angular for i do you
196:35 - have a job right now for
196:36 - that using angular
196:39 - now i'm uh i'm doing like
196:43 - training training ah okay gotcha gotcha
196:45 - gotcha
196:46 - i mean look if you're doing angular
196:49 - that's fine
196:53 - gotcha gotcha if you're a learning
196:55 - angler that is okay
196:56 - you can keep learning angular because
196:58 - it's still a good framework to learn
197:00 - right and you start it and most
197:01 - importantly what you want to understand
197:02 - is
197:03 - do not skip those basic javascript
197:05 - things that you need to learn right
197:07 - like i said a lot too many people skip
197:09 - the step of like learning some basic
197:11 - javascript and they go to the framework
197:13 - right away
197:14 - so okay sure learn angular but also
197:18 - make sure that you're learning those
197:19 - fundamentals of javascript and those
197:21 - basic javascript things okay
197:23 - like how do i create a function in
197:25 - javascript how do i use an array in
197:27 - javascript
197:28 - how do i loop through it so that's the
197:30 - one big thing one big thing i recommend
197:32 - for you is
197:33 - to just keep that in mind but you don't
197:35 - need to switch to react.js right now
197:37 - that's that should not be your goal
197:41 - okay that means angular now is better
197:43 - it's good yeah it's good it's good it's
197:45 - good
197:46 - okay my second question is
197:51 - i start this uh full stack path
197:55 - because my future goal is to be a
197:58 - devil okay expert okay and now i want uh
198:02 - some advices to

199:06 - like you can start learning devops right
199:07 - now you can start learning how to build
199:08 - servers right now
199:13 - you see what i mean okay right
199:16 - so keep learning what you're learning
199:18 - but also start
199:19 - put start going into a little bit of
199:21 - devops section as well

205:46 - uh technology but for the last 11 years
205:50 - oh wow really i'm i'm uh trying to
205:53 - switch to a full stack uh developer role
205:55 - okay so i'm in process of building my
205:58 - profile and it was
205:59 - absolutely helpful extremely helpful
206:01 - that's awesome right

206:31 - yeah i'm staying the west coast right
206:32 - now in los angeles yeah los angeles yeah
206:35 - yeah so uh just wanted to know like uh
206:38 - like this
206:38 - will you be having any course on
206:40 - react.js any bootcamp covering react.js
206:43 - yeah so so the tomorrow's boot camp
206:45 - tomorrow's um
206:47 - i mean yes of course our boot camp
206:49 - within clever programmer does cover
206:51 - react.js
206:52 - uh but in terms of free boot camp in
206:56 - terms of free boot camp
206:57 - maybe i think next month we'll see maybe
206:59 - next month we'll cover that
207:02 - okay we don't have we don't have another
207:03 - pipeline but we do have we do a lot of
207:04 - videos on youtube
207:06 - from clever programmer on react.js
207:10 - yeah be sure to check those out yeah and
207:13 - just
207:13 - another question is like uh say uh it's
207:16 - been 11 years i'm in a different
207:17 - technology and if i want to switch to
207:19 - uh like full stack you always start as a
207:22 - fresh like a junior developer right but
207:25 - the experience is 11 years
207:27 - so how do you see it like how is the
207:29 - opportunity for folks to
207:31 - easily switch at a yeah so
207:34 - here's what happened here's here's how i
207:36 - see it happening okay
207:37 - you will start out you will learn
207:38 - react.js right you will learn the new
207:40 - technology you will learn foster
207:42 - development
207:43 - you will probably start out as a junior
207:45 - at first at your at a new job
207:47 - but then you'll probably go to a senior
207:50 - within six months
207:52 - okay yeah so basically how is it like
207:54 - you need to get that first kind of like
207:56 - experience
207:56 - and a job using that new technology but
207:59 - once you got it because you have so much
208:00 - experience from all technologies
208:02 - once you've got it you're pretty much
208:03 - set and you can count yourself the same
208:04 - developer and react gs honestly
208:09 - thank you so much thank you so much for
208:10 - the explanation you got it you got it
208:12 - awesome you guys are awesome thank you
208:14 - i'm glad you enjoyed it we'll see you
208:15 - tomorrow okay
208:17 - thank you okay awesome sonny sorry
208:19 - that's a question in the chat
208:20 - some other question let me see
208:24 - what are pre-ex uh please notes what are
208:26 - the prerequisites for react what level
208:28 - of js should you know
208:30 - or when do you know it's time transition
208:32 - so transition will
208:34 - will be fairly easy for example you'll
208:35 - know exactly what tradition is when the
208:37 - transition is right honestly when you go
208:40 - ahead and
208:42 - if i told you a question like hey can
208:43 - you merge two arrays for me together if
208:45 - you could do that okay good transition
208:46 - point
208:48 - if you have built an amazing price with
208:50 - javascript and you know those
208:51 - fundamentals
208:52 - you can build javascript projects from
208:55 - scratch
208:56 - without too much crazy knowledge of
208:58 - trying to look up on google
208:59 - or without too much of you know uh
209:03 - too much of kind of like second guessing
209:05 - yourself
209:06 - like you should know how to create a
209:08 - variable you should know an array is
209:10 - you should know what an object is you
209:11 - should know how the class is you should
209:12 - know how to create and use them
209:14 - in an actual website right
209:17 - if you know all those things that's a
209:18 - good time to transition into into
209:20 - javascript
209:21 - or react gs my bad but if you don't know
209:24 - those things you you don't know those
209:26 - fundamentals
209:26 - then don't push yourself so much into
209:29 - interact.js just yet
209:31 - give yourself time to learn those basics
209:33 - and then you'll be good
209:34 - hopefully that answers yes guys
209:36 - foundation is so so so
209:38 - important imagine it you know you want
209:39 - to build a house right
209:41 - if your foundation if the foundation of
209:43 - the house is not
209:44 - strong then every house you will build
209:48 - from that moment on will always have a
209:50 - weak foundation
209:52 - so your house will always be weak
209:53 - doesn't matter how pretty it looks on
209:55 - the outside
209:56 - with react or some other nice framework
209:59 - it will always have a weak foundation
210:01 - and actually this also
210:03 - because i talked to a lot of students
210:04 - okay i
210:06 - see that they're shooting themselves
210:08 - basically in the foot
210:10 - because they're going they're having
210:11 - this progressing line like oh i know how
210:13 - to take these projects and ah
210:15 - a react project and then i asked them
210:17 - did you know
210:18 - so what kind of data structure is the
210:20 - props
210:21 - in react and they go like or what is the
210:24 - process
210:27 - yeah or what do you do yeah sorry jesse
210:29 - and then they're like
210:30 - it's an object and then they say i don't
210:32 - know what an object is and then i go
210:33 - back and i say like an object is a
210:36 - fundamental javascript concept yeah
210:39 - you should know that first before going
210:41 - into react that's a typical example of
210:43 - somebody that went in to react
210:45 - too fast yeah okay so make sure that
210:48 - doesn't happen to you
210:49 - because you have to go all the way there
210:51 - and then you have to go all the way back
210:53 - which makes you feel like
210:55 - oh i'm at the starting point again i
210:57 - don't know anything
210:58 - which is true you don't know anything at
211:00 - this point i'm sorry to break it to you
211:02 - yeah
211:03 - however that's the whole thing that's
211:06 - the whole thing why we're saying this
211:07 - the whole time your fundamentals are so
211:10 - important so you don't have to go make a
211:13 - detour okay
211:14 - that's a good thing just gotta go like
211:15 - this that's a good point that's a quite
211:17 - that's a good point
211:18 - um so yes what is this best programming
211:21 - uh what is the best program to start
211:22 - with
211:22 - if you are wanting to get serious about
211:25 - programming
211:26 - then the goal to program that allows you
211:28 - to go towards any field
211:29 - i mean jeffrey if i mean i think
211:33 - what we're learning right now in terms
211:34 - of javascript i think that's the best
211:35 - way to start honestly
211:36 - i asked about oh program
211:40 - yeah i mean one is we have a course
211:42 - called prophecy means program language
211:45 - he says i don't know i think that's
211:48 - about the program what is the best
211:49 - program to start with if you are wanting
211:51 - to get serious with programming
211:54 - and then he says sorry program language
211:56 - oh okay
211:57 - yeah javascript is a great start because
212:00 - javascript will allow you to do a lot of
212:01 - different things right
212:03 - you can go from javascript to react gs
212:05 - from javascript then to
212:07 - and then from javascript basically to
212:09 - any angularjs or framework right
212:11 - and once you know those frameworks and
212:13 - pretty much and you know javascript very
212:14 - well
212:15 - then you can actually apply that kind of
212:16 - knowledge to them if you learn a new
212:18 - language like python
212:19 - then jingle and so forth so um i
212:22 - actually think is you know
212:24 - i know somebody said cc plus plus or
212:25 - python maybe those are great too
212:28 - i personally started with javascript
212:29 - that was my first start and then i went
212:31 - from javascript to python so
212:33 - um honestly either way you go python or
212:36 - javascript
212:37 - either way you go you will kind of learn
212:39 - a lot
212:40 - and then that will allow you to apply to
212:42 - your knowledge to many different things
212:44 - the thing is if you look it's kind of
212:46 - like this let me ask this question
212:47 - if i know how to drive a car can i drive
212:50 - any car that i want
212:54 - pretty much especially if i know how to
212:56 - drive a stick shift
213:00 - right if i know how to drive a stick
213:02 - shift i can pretty much drive
213:04 - any car i want no matter what car you
213:06 - give me
213:07 - you give me an automatic car i will
213:08 - drive it you give me another stick shift
213:10 - i'll drive it
213:12 - it's the same situation here yeah yeah
213:15 - learn how to drive the car
213:17 - learn javascript and then the other
213:19 - stuff will be easy
213:22 - somebody said can i drive stick shift
213:23 - yes i can drive a stick shift guys yes i
213:24 - learned in ukraine
213:27 - i was actually thinking like what do you
213:29 - mean by sticks yet but yeah i also drive
213:31 - stick shift
213:35 - [Music]
213:37 - yeah yeah but i i no longer have a car
213:39 - that has any gears so
213:43 - my car has one gear only that's it and
213:45 - that's just full speed ahead
213:50 - that's it awesome guys i think that's
213:52 - pretty much it i think that's a rather
213:53 - questions
213:55 - that's pretty much it guys i think guys
213:57 - honestly
213:58 - this was well you had a question back
214:02 - yeah okay okay go ahead hold on go ahead
214:04 - i know i know go ahead back
214:06 - thank you can you hear me yeah
214:13 - i can't hear you you're muted back we
214:15 - could hear you and then the mo
214:17 - there was a moment we couldn't hear you
214:20 - go ahead try again
214:22 - no no you're muted still click unmute
214:27 - there we go yeah there we go okay
214:30 - uh what time is the homework uh
214:33 - do because i i've only got like a little
