00:01 - okay so somebody so he just said um you
00:06 - have a wife and she needs time to and of
00:08 - course she does but also keep in mind
00:11 - people like Gary Vaynerchuk or people
00:14 - like Grant Cardone
00:15 - also have a wife but they're run like
00:18 - multiple businesses there are multi
00:21 - millionaires they change the lives of
00:23 - millions of people they work non-stop
00:27 - yet they still find the time to keep up
00:31 - with their health they still spend
00:33 - quality time with their children and to
00:35 - still spend quality time with their
00:38 - family so don't lie to yourself that you
00:40 - don't have time I'm not gonna lie to
00:44 - myself that I don't have time we mess up
00:47 - but we just need to be honest with why
00:49 - we're making those mistakes okay that's
00:52 - where your real change is gonna come
00:54 - from if you can't look at yourself in
00:57 - the mirror and be honest with yourself
00:58 - don't expect anybody else to change your
01:01 - life I can't change your life that
01:03 - person next to you can't change your
01:05 - life and if you're not gonna be honest
01:07 - with yourself you can't change your life
01:09 - either so start from there start from
01:14 - being honest with yourself exactly where
01:16 - you are in your relationship in your
01:19 - career in your life your friends near
01:24 - you write your girlfriend/boyfriend
01:29 - your wife husband whatever start there
01:32 - and just go through the list and see
01:34 - what level each of those things are at
01:37 - are you happy making the money or making
01:39 - every year are you happy being able to
01:43 - just go from paycheck to paycheck
01:45 - are you happy doing things in a way
01:49 - that's average where you know you could
01:51 - be doing better if you're not then there
01:58 - are things that need to change and to
02:01 - start that change you need to start by
02:03 - being honest with yourself okay because
02:06 - if you make excuses and if you let
02:08 - yourself off the hook and you say things
02:10 - like oh but I have this
02:13 - so that needs time too while that is
02:15 - true you have those 24 hours if you
02:19 - juice them and you melt them you can get
02:21 - a lot done all right you can get a lot
02:25 - done like I'm gonna tell you from my
02:29 - personal experience and I'm not amazing
02:32 - or anything I am you know I was a dumb
02:35 - college kid and now I'm just a kid who's
02:38 - trying to run clever programmer and make
02:40 - sure you guys get massive value out of
02:41 - it but when I was building clever
02:46 - programmer you know this is the fastest
02:48 - channel to go from zero to a hundred
02:50 - thousand subscribers for coding ever how
02:54 - did that happen
02:54 - was was there magic involved no I was
02:57 - spending like hundreds of hours a week I
03:00 - was still spending time with my family I
03:03 - still kept up with my friends you guys
03:06 - still see my friends in my Instagram
03:08 - Facebook stories on snapchat and even on
03:12 - YouTube and even on my live streams from
03:13 - time to time I still kept up with my
03:15 - family I still kept up with my friends I
03:17 - still had a job I was doing I was a
03:21 - coaching students for programming and
03:24 - chess and video editing and all kinds of
03:27 - stuff and students from 20 years of age
03:29 - to 60 years of age students who were
03:31 - going to kindergarten to students who
03:36 - were 45 years old and doing their PhD
03:39 - program for analytics and needed to use
03:42 - Python for machine learning I was also
03:47 - playing chess competitively at the time
03:49 - and going to tournaments I was also
03:52 - going to ping pong tournaments at the
03:55 - same time I was building this channel
03:58 - like a maniac okay I was also in a
04:03 - relationship at that time I was also
04:06 - going to the gym I was also getting
04:10 - really good sleep and now we have a
04:17 - full-on company what started as a dream
04:21 - just a hope and dream and aspirations
04:24 - and I was like maybe you know one day
04:26 - people will look at the
04:27 - and get value out of it maybe clever
04:29 - programmer will be able to provide value
04:31 - to other people maybe I can help
04:33 - somebody who's not just me and a lot of
04:36 - these things that I learned I can share
04:37 - this with other people because I was I
04:39 - don't want to hold this to myself
04:41 - because I thought what's the point of
04:43 - being alive if you can't provide value
04:46 - to others and if others don't know about
04:48 - you and what started as a dream a year
04:52 - ago right now we have hundreds of
04:55 - thousands of students on our YouTube we
04:58 - have millions of people of viewers on
05:00 - YouTube
05:00 - we have a lot of people on an Instagram
05:03 - Facebook and we have over hundreds
05:06 - hundreds of thousands of students who've
05:08 - went through our coding courses and
05:11 - people have gotten jobs people have gone
05:14 - promoted at their work people have
05:17 - gotten internships for you know as
05:19 - Python Django people have who are web
05:23 - developers have saved their company over
05:26 - $23,000 people have become Python web
05:30 - developers and now even have clients
05:33 - people have done things there was a
05:37 - person who is a freelancer CG generalist
05:39 - and after taking my course he was able
05:42 - to do something that was taking the
05:43 - other team in Brazil seven days to do he
05:47 - was able to automate it with Python in
05:49 - four hours and made $1,200
05:52 - all right so all of this stuff happening
05:58 - and getting people results and making
06:02 - sure to be there with my students and
06:03 - always being there with you guys and
06:05 - listening to you guys and responding to
06:06 - your emails and your comments and
06:08 - whatever things you guys have in your
06:10 - live chat and providing free content for
06:12 - a full year non-stop day in and day out
06:16 - every Monday at 11:00 a.m. you would get
06:18 - a video there were weeks where I was
06:20 - making seven videos a week for you guys
06:22 - without asking for a cent
06:29 - I still made time for all of those
06:32 - things right and I'm not even close to
06:36 - somebody like you know all these other
06:39 - people I'm sure they're people who are
06:41 - on this livestream who work way more
06:42 - than I do and are way way way way more
06:44 - productive but I'm just sharing from my
06:47 - personal experience that it's possible
06:51 - to make that time it's possible to have
06:55 - that time for yourself 24 hours is way
06:58 - more than enough in a day but you just
07:01 - need to be true and honest to yourself
07:03 - look yourself in the mirror and go
07:05 - exactly where you are don't lie don't
07:07 -  yourself don't hang out with
07:09 - people who just make you feel
07:10 - comfortable because I'm telling you
07:12 - they're not your true friends they're
07:15 - just there to make you feel comfortable
07:16 - and that's it you want people who give
07:18 - you a reality check who are your cool
07:21 - friends and support you and make joke
07:23 - around and have fun but at the same time
07:25 - push you in the right direction and if
07:29 - you have that and you reverse engineer
07:31 - your way to be motivated and to be
07:33 - passionate and instead of listening to
07:35 - music you listen to books and while
07:36 - you're driving or while you're driving
07:39 - driving and when you're watching Netflix
07:41 - replacing that what learning and getting
07:44 - online trainings whether it's on more
07:46 - motivation or self-development or coding
07:50 - work on yourself alright be honest with
07:53 - yourself and you'll see yourself
07:54 - improving and trust me you don't need 24
07:57 - hours in a day 24 hours in a day is more
08:01 - than enough time to help you achieve
08:02 - your dreams alright but you just have to
08:05 - start by being honest with yourself
