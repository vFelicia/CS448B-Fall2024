02:34 - with this whole world of bootstrap
02:38 - and uh son you want to talk about this
02:40 - yep so guys
02:42 - major companies are using bootstrap
02:43 - right now we've got instagram
02:45 - linkedin twitter so interesting story
02:47 - that rishi actually told me earlier
02:49 - what's the interesting story hiroshi
02:51 - with twitter
02:52 - so the ex-employee of the twitter
02:55 - created bootstrap and the name of
02:57 - bootstrap in previous days was
02:59 - twitter blueprint and that's super
03:01 - interesting yeah
03:03 - so this was an ex-employee from twitter
03:05 - themselves actually went ahead and
03:06 - created this
03:07 - and then they actually went ahead and
03:08 - used it so that's awesome to know
03:10 - spotify
03:10 - lyft tinder all these massive companies
03:13 - are using bootstrap
03:14 - right now so massive value in learning
03:17 - and
03:17 - understanding how bootstrap works
03:19 - seriously
03:20 - massive value and a lot of these like
03:23 - instagram is using it
03:24 - linkedin is using it i mean even lyft
03:26 - and tinder are using bootstrap
03:28 - so that's kind of crazy it just shows
03:30 - you i think it's the most one of the
03:31 - most
03:32 - popular libraries right for front end
03:34 - like or maybe even the most
03:37 - yeah especially when you're beginning
03:38 - guys especially when you're just
03:40 - starting off in your development journey
03:41 - bootstrap is a massive tool like
03:43 - especially when you're landing clients
03:44 - you're doing your first bit of work
03:46 - i would definitely recommend jumping
03:48 - into bootstrap because when you start
03:49 - developing your websites don't look that
03:51 - great they look kind of like boring
03:53 - using bootstrap is immediately going to
03:55 - give you that nice looking website
03:57 - so um what's your thoughts on that rishi
04:00 - yeah i think bootstrap is one of the
04:02 - most popular css framework and it's it's
04:04 - got like high popularity and it's
04:06 - like easy to use even though big
04:08 - companies they have like this great
04:09 - developer still uses bootstrap so i
04:11 - think it's the most convenient and the
04:12 - most popular framework out there
04:14 - yes awesome we have a lot of people
04:16 - coming
04:17 - in to the stream and they are pretty
04:19 - pumped about this
04:21 - excited to have you guys even elijah who
04:23 - joined profitable shortcut yesterday i
04:24 - spoke with him and he's on the stream so
04:26 - elijah welcome
04:27 - here now let's talk about what is
04:30 - bootstrap
04:31 - and bootstrap basically allows you to
04:33 - build fast
04:34 - responsive sites and you guys can do
04:36 - this with bootstrap now it is
04:38 - opinionated and it kind of has its own
04:40 - way of allowing you to do things
04:42 - but with bootstrap 5 they've kind of
04:44 - opened it up and made it a lot of plu
04:46 - easier to plug and play with a lot of
04:48 - things right sunny
04:50 - yeah yeah exactly and guys the aim of
04:52 - using bootstrap is to get something what
04:54 - we like to call
04:55 - a mobile first design right so mobile
04:58 - first which means
04:59 - that it's going to work on a mobile and
05:01 - then it goes upward so it's going to
05:02 - work on a mobile it's going to work on a
05:03 - tablet it's going to work on a desktop
05:05 - so regardless of what screen you're on
05:07 - that's what we're using bootstrap for to
05:08 - achieve that sort of
05:10 - design and that look and feel regardless
05:12 - of what device you're using
05:14 - yep yeah and just to add to that like i
05:16 - mean bootstrap is super responsive and
05:18 - it's like the grid system and everything
05:19 - is so powerful and that is the reason
05:21 - people
05:21 - like use this bootstrap because it's
05:23 - super super easy to like make responsive
05:25 - websites with bootstrap even though you
05:27 - don't have different knowledge about
05:28 - media queries in css right
05:30 - so that is the reason like most of the
05:31 - people use as bootstrap
05:33 - nice nice that is amazing now let's go
05:35 - and talk about the features
05:37 - of bootstrap so one thing is it's very
05:40 - easy to use
05:41 - uh it is mobile friendly and then what
05:44 - are you thinking about the customizable
05:46 - bootstrap sonny
05:48 - so customizable guys it's massively
05:50 - customizable you have a number of
05:52 - different templates that you can
05:53 - actually go ahead and use
05:55 - so these are they range from a bunch of
05:56 - free templates you can use
05:58 - also premium and guys it's open source
06:00 - which means it's actually
06:01 - massive the even the code itself you can
06:03 - contribute to so bootstrap is
06:05 - customizable
06:06 - like enough on its own but if you want
06:08 - to go ahead and add features to it you
06:09 - can even do that because it's open
06:11 - source
06:11 - so we have that so it's customizable and
06:14 - it's also
06:14 - super simple to integrate um rishi have
06:17 - you worked with pre-styled components
06:19 - and the responsive features like the
06:20 - grid you mentioned
06:22 - yeah so for sure like it's uh it's super
06:25 - easy to integrate the docs are super
06:26 - easy the installation is super easy and
06:28 - the pre-styled components
06:29 - they are like super easy like if even if
06:31 - you want to use button even if you want
06:33 - to use grid
06:34 - or flex work or even if you want to use
06:35 - card it's super easy you just go to docs
06:38 - and there is the
06:39 - whole code for code for cards and you
06:41 - just copy and paste and it's super easy
06:43 - to implement
06:44 - you want the component so there are
06:45 - different kinds of components
06:47 - and like you were saying even sunny when
06:48 - we were talking earlier it's super
06:50 - responsive
06:51 - it has a lot of browser compatibility
06:53 - but there's one browser that they're
06:54 - actually not going to be using moving
06:56 - forward
06:57 - if you guys want to take a guess if you
06:59 - guys want to take a guess at which
07:01 - browser they're not going to be using
07:02 - drop it in the comments below we're
07:03 - going to cover that in a second
07:04 - and then they have a great great grid
07:06 - system which uh which actually surprised
07:08 - me when we were speaking
07:10 - earlier on zoom sunny you were like
07:12 - their grid system is actually faster
07:14 - than the uh
07:16 - fl the grid system that you just use
07:18 - with css
07:19 - yeah so honestly guys and this is coming
07:21 - from a professional sort of standpoint
07:23 - like when you're
07:24 - yes you can code extremely beautiful
07:26 - websites with flexbox and grid css grid
07:28 - like we do on the live builds
07:30 - but sometimes when you have freelance
07:31 - clients you have a bunch of jobs lined
07:33 - up you need
07:34 - speed you need like something which is
07:35 - fast something which is robust
07:37 - in this case bootstrap is your answer so
07:40 - if you have a lot of jobs on the go i
07:41 - would really recommend
07:42 - jumping over to bootstrap and and using
07:44 - it as your sort of point to go to
07:46 - instead of doing everything custom and
07:48 - bespoke really really good place to
07:50 - start off a bootstrap also guys
07:51 - like as you mentioned browser
07:53 - compatibility this is actually really
07:54 - important point
07:55 - because they dropped one of the uh
07:58 - browsers which a lot of people don't
07:59 - like so i can see a lot of people
08:01 - dropping it in
08:02 - and i think we've got some correct
08:03 - answers right hey nice
08:05 - let me see if i can actually uh show
08:07 - those answers on the screen that people
08:09 - are guessing so i'm gonna show some of
08:10 - those by ram komar
08:12 - he says internet explorer we have people
08:15 - saying edge
08:17 - people saying different things we're
08:18 - going to reveal that to you guys in just
08:20 - a second and uh yeah guys this is
08:23 - actually a blog post that i think is a
08:24 - good resource i'm gonna drop it in chat
08:26 - for you guys you guys can actually even
08:28 - go to it
08:28 - and if you're watching this video we're
08:30 - gonna cover this in just a second you
08:32 - can even just type in the url that you
08:34 - see at the top here
08:35 - but this is bootstrap 5 alpha so it's
08:38 - not like the uh
08:40 - most stable version yet it's the alpha
08:42 - version but it is
08:43 - out as of june 16th and this is their
08:46 - blog post that they posted and they talk
08:48 - about like how now
08:50 - it has a new look and feel which we will
08:53 - be talking a lot
08:54 - about for example uh everything is flat
08:56 - now right sunny you said that
08:57 - yeah so previously and a lot of designs
09:00 - especially when now like i started off
09:02 - it was very rounded guys like like
09:03 - even when you're using your iphone back
09:05 - in the day you had like a very rounded
09:06 - button 3d sort of design
09:08 - whereas now if you notice material ui
09:10 - bootstrap all of them follow this really
09:12 - flat clean looking design so they've
09:16 - gone ahead and updated all of that in
09:17 - bootstrap five and just to touch on the
09:19 - alpha point that kazi mentioned in case
09:21 - you're wondering what alpha is
09:22 - it's when they release something which
09:24 - is in like it's sort of development
09:26 - stage right so just to give you guys
09:28 - some context to that
09:29 - i actually started using firebase uh the
09:31 - real-time database when it was in alpha
09:33 - right so just to let you guys know so if
09:36 - if i used it when it was in alpha and
09:37 - i'm still using it now
09:38 - it's it's actually pretty safe to go
09:40 - ahead and do that right so it's pretty
09:41 - good safe and then when it moves to beta
09:42 - you pretty much
09:43 - rest assured that it's going to go
09:44 - forward so definitely worth
09:46 - reading this blog and checking out
09:48 - definitely and now
09:50 - if we go down they change their logo
09:51 - this is a pretty cool logo i think that
09:53 - they actually have
09:54 - we're going to talk about what new
09:56 - things are happening with jquery
09:57 - and javascript and how they decided not
10:00 - to use any more jquery moving forward
10:02 - we're going to touch base on the css
10:04 - custom properties you guys that they
10:07 - added in so it's kind of really cool you
10:08 - can basically use your own variables
10:11 - we're going to touch a little bit based
10:12 - on their docs the fact that they
10:14 - expanded their colors overall
10:16 - and even how their forms now have kind
10:18 - of a different feel to it
10:20 - and they're much more customizable than
10:22 - before
10:24 - um and the fact that they have enhanced
10:27 - grid system
10:28 - so this is actually a really cool thing
10:30 - because if you're using
10:31 - previous bootstrap like bootstrap 4 you
10:34 - can actually move on to bootstrap 5 in a
10:36 - really easy
10:37 - transition so it's not like everybody
10:39 - who's using bootstrap 5
10:41 - bootstrap 4 is now screwed you can
10:43 - actually just really easily move
10:45 - into bootstrap 5. yeah exactly
10:48 - yep so let's go back to the slides here
10:51 - and i'm going to pop them open and now
10:53 - we're going to go on here and start
10:55 - talking and sunny
10:57 - go ahead take it away my man and sonny
10:58 - you want to center yourself a little bit
11:00 - more because sometimes you're not
11:01 - there we go that's good it's good yeah
11:02 - pretty good awesome nice
11:05 - so uh guys here's a quick overview of
11:07 - what happened in bootstrap five and then
11:08 - we'll touch base on every single point
11:10 - so jquery was removed massive decision
11:13 - guys
11:14 - massive decision yeah and it goes to
11:16 - show you that i see a lot of comments
11:17 - when we're doing these live
11:18 - builds of uh people even we got one back
11:20 - now by ao nahin
11:22 - who says do we need to learn jquery so
11:24 - guys bootstrap's
11:25 - massively used a framework and here's
11:28 - your answer if they're removing it
11:30 - take this is some a vote of confidence
11:31 - you don't actually need to learn jquery
11:33 - anymore future code just drop rip jquery
11:36 - yeah so pretty much jquery is now is old
11:39 - news guys we don't use it
11:41 - they've switched over to pure javascript
11:43 - which means faster websites
11:44 - responsive font sizes is huge so let's
11:47 - go ahead and actually jump into the next
11:49 - slides we'll touch base on each of these
11:50 - individually i think that'll be a bit
11:52 - more easier
11:54 - so guys response font sizes deck uh the
11:57 - remove card decks
11:59 - they switch to vanilla javascript uh
12:01 - dropped ie support and yeah let's keep
12:03 - going and we're gonna go through each of
12:04 - these
12:05 - yeah so jquery was removed we've touched
12:08 - base on this and basically what does
12:09 - this mean it means that they're using
12:10 - vanilla javascript now
12:12 - um which i think we mentioned on the
12:14 - next slide and basically what that means
12:16 - guys is it's super performant so vanilla
12:18 - javascript is the fastest we're going to
12:19 - get
12:20 - it's like a bare bone to javascript so
12:22 - they've managed to get everything down
12:23 - to being perfected
12:25 - no libraries no like extra code just
12:28 - hanging around because jquery is a
12:30 - massive library and slows down your code
12:32 - over time and
12:33 - just having that dependency like there's
12:34 - no really real reason to have it if you
12:36 - don't need it exactly
12:38 - and uh with this uh with this said that
12:40 - that's pretty much gonna allow us to
12:42 - have those
12:42 - that responsiveness and that speed that
12:44 - we're sort of uh looking for when we're
12:46 - building sites
12:47 - and then the next thing guys responsive
12:49 - font sizes so this is huge this is
12:51 - really really
12:52 - important because even if you see in our
12:53 - live builds when we're actually building
12:55 - stuff
12:55 - we don't actually use responsive fun uh
12:57 - pixels which we like you could use
12:59 - different sort of
13:00 - numbers i think you can use rem which is
13:02 - a responsive unit but in
13:04 - in bootstrap you don't have to worry
13:05 - about any of that you just use the
13:06 - response
13:08 - just one thing here's a good thing
13:09 - erican asks and he says how do you use
13:11 - bootstrap in react is it only for
13:14 - blah blah you there's actually a library
13:18 - called
13:18 - react bootstrap and it's built
13:21 - for use with react so that's actually a
13:24 - great thing that you guys can actually
13:26 - use
13:27 - really good question that is because
13:28 - i've used that personally
13:30 - uh being the big fan of react i am so
13:33 - you guys can definitely go check that
13:34 - out we touch base on that
13:36 - later on in the slide so you guys can
13:38 - check out the link
13:39 - and we'll have a link for that by the
13:40 - way we are at over 400 people watching
13:43 - live that is amazing you guys that's
13:46 - like if we had like a little stadium
13:47 - that
13:48 - place would be booked or if it was like
13:50 - a you know like a hilton hotel
13:52 - and you have those conference rooms it
13:53 - would be packed so thank you guys for
13:56 - being here we're so pumped
13:58 - what can they do sunny to help us out a
14:00 - little bit with this video
14:02 - all we ask guys is that you smash that
14:04 - thumbs up button to get that video
14:06 - as many people as you possibly can and
14:09 - if you have friends if you have a mobile
14:10 - device
14:11 - literally switch on put the video on
14:13 - let's get that number up to 500 guys
14:16 - yeah because guys it we spent a lot of
14:19 - time preparing these for you guys always
14:21 - and our number one goal is for the video
14:23 - to just go out to as many people
14:25 - as possible and for as many people to
14:27 - get value from it as possible you know
14:29 - if somebody's a developer they're on
14:30 - their lunch break
14:31 - we want them to be able to watch it and
14:33 - maybe just get one little tip
14:35 - and now they can either get their salary
14:37 - boosted or they can be seen as more
14:39 - valuable to the team because they'll
14:40 - learn about bootstrap 5 something they
14:41 - didn't know about
14:43 - and we can all be a part of that and
14:45 - actually get it to that person and help
14:47 - them out with their careers
14:48 - by just hitting that thumbs up button
14:50 - because it just gives it so much more
14:52 - reach it's kind of like the youtube
14:53 - algorithm is broken so by just doing
14:54 - that
14:55 - help out that would help us so much and
14:56 - with that said guys let's keep going
15:00 - nice the next i think guys yep oh sorry
15:02 - going richie
15:03 - yeah sorry so i think yeah the
15:05 - responsive uh font sizes are one of the
15:07 - most important thing because like you
15:08 - and i was working with like bootstrap
15:10 - and when you like
15:11 - make a website responsive it's easy to
15:13 - do that with bootstrap but again then
15:15 - you have to go through when you have to
15:16 - design for mobile you have to make those
15:18 - font sizes smaller
15:19 - and it's just like you know it's just
15:20 - not the right way to approach but this
15:22 - is like massive and i'm like super
15:24 - excited for this
15:25 - yeah so it's big big addition to uh to
15:28 - bootstrap five
15:29 - massive guys the next thing drop they
15:31 - drop by the way internet explorer
15:33 - yeah uh what i just one interesting
15:35 - thing so randeep says
15:37 - you should do a live show as soon as
15:38 - it's allowed i would attend 100
15:40 - so i actually do want to let all of you
15:42 - guys know we're getting this like sick
15:43 - ass place
15:44 - uh in beverly hills and it's going to be
15:47 - like a clever programmer
15:48 - mansion and from there we're going to be
15:50 - doing these live streams every single
15:52 - day and we're also thinking to actually
15:54 - host
15:55 - live shows there for very few people
15:57 - that can come in just because of kovid
15:59 - so we would want like only like five
16:01 - people or seven people
16:03 - max so if that's something you guys are
16:04 - interested in do dm me on instagram and
16:07 - we can have a conversation about it
16:09 - yeah all right moving on to the next
16:11 - thing so sunny go for it man take it
16:13 - away
16:14 - yeah so next guys they did a massive
16:16 - decision here which i love
16:18 - they dropped internet explorer so
16:19 - heartbreaking yeah
16:22 - dude like much needed needed to die so
16:24 - long ago i promise you that
16:26 - the amount of times everything would
16:28 - work on chrome on firefox but internet
16:30 - explorer 10 and 11 would
16:31 - just give me such a pain in the arsenal
16:33 - like i'm so happy they did that so now
16:35 - they can focus on
16:36 - the actual browsers that we care about
16:38 - and edge as well is pretty decent so
16:39 - they got rid of that so now
16:41 - that they can optimize it and that also
16:42 - means that css variables now work which
16:45 - is why
16:47 - they got rid of that that is beautiful
16:49 - and just a friendly little reminder for
16:51 - everybody
16:52 - just go ahead and uh smash that like
16:54 - button
16:56 - nice
16:56 - [Laughter]
17:00 - nice so the next two
17:03 - things um we actually can sort of jump
17:05 - through these ones so we've got the svg
17:07 - icons right they added a huge s
17:10 - nice for you guys who don't know what
17:13 - svgs are they're kind of like so imagine
17:15 - we had an icon
17:15 - svgs mean that they are like a vector
17:17 - icon so no matter how much
17:19 - i stretch that thing make it like higher
17:22 - seriously
17:23 - like you guys it that's so important you
17:27 - guys what he's saying and i just kind of
17:28 - want to just
17:28 - jump in and emphasize it so much more
17:31 - like i want to scream about this because
17:33 - if you get pngs and jpegs and when i'm
17:35 - doing a lot of photoshop stuff or even
17:37 - front-end design
17:38 - it's so frustrating to you constantly
17:41 - get these images that
17:42 - when they're like dragged a certain way
17:44 - or they're like distorted a certain way
17:46 - to start to get very like squeeze it
17:48 - like they're like all screwed up like
17:50 - this or very squished
17:51 - or they're with and then we have to do
17:54 - things like object fit contain and do a
17:55 - lot of like jiggery pokery to make it
17:57 - work
17:58 - but svgs are just vectors you could
18:00 - literally
18:02 - pull it maximize it to infinite length
18:05 - like literally make it like 10 000
18:07 - pixels you know and then boom it's
18:09 - perfect and if you make it tiny it's
18:11 - still like perfect
18:12 - exactly so really really massive use
18:15 - cases for the svgs guys and
18:17 - they're just crystal clear as well they
18:18 - make your website look so nice
18:20 - um and then what's the deal with custom
18:22 - css variables
18:24 - yeah so this came in because they
18:25 - dropped internet explorer 10 and 11 so
18:27 - they were finally able to bring these in
18:29 - custom css variables are awesome because
18:31 - oh
18:32 - hey nice we just got sb's
18:36 - five dollar donation and uh sb's
18:40 - go ahead sonny nice yeah so we
18:43 - um oh fuzzy thank you and we just hit
18:45 - 500 guys
18:46 - and he says i'm not sure if you saw my
18:48 - comment but your videos help me solidify
18:50 - what i'm learning in my boot camp right
18:52 - now
18:53 - thank you so much react is hard
18:56 - love that hey i hope we're making it a
19:00 - little easier with the live builds
19:01 - that is amazing thank you guys thank you
19:04 - so much like seriously appreciate that
19:06 - that's like
19:07 - such a big vote of confidence thank you
19:09 - yeah massively appreciate that
19:12 - um yeah so guys the css variables pretty
19:15 - much just how we have variables in
19:16 - javascript
19:17 - now we have them in css so let's say you
19:19 - had background color you can assign it
19:21 - to a css variable
19:22 - and just use that variable throughout
19:23 - your app rather oh nice
19:26 - that's actually really cool exactly so
19:28 - imagine you had like background color
19:30 - and then yep you could pretty much just
19:32 - go ahead and i think the way you would
19:33 - use it is you write v-a-r
19:35 - or like it's like dash dash v-a-r and
19:38 - you can pretty much
19:38 - open so dash v-a-r and i think you just
19:42 - do it like that or something along those
19:43 - lines and we pretty much can use that
19:45 - variable throughout the project which
19:46 - means
19:47 - if we ever change the background color
19:48 - it will change everywhere we use the
19:50 - variable
19:50 - beautiful that is beautiful so just one
19:53 - variable
19:54 - uh and then you just that's awesome it's
19:56 - like constants right you we have them at
19:58 - the top of the file and then you change
19:59 - it everything changes
20:01 - exactly that is super useful that is
20:04 - super i think we should use that maybe
20:05 - in the next few builds maybe we'll we'll
20:07 - definitely chuck then or something
20:08 - yeah nice akuma's deception says i have
20:12 - an interview coming up with
20:13 - ibm i wanted to thank you guys for
20:15 - helping me throughout my journey wish me
20:17 - luck
20:18 - oh nice that's awesome dude well done
20:21 - ibm's a pretty decent company that's
20:23 - pretty that's nice let us know how that
20:25 - goes
20:25 - that decent company it's massive yo
20:28 - freaking
20:28 - amazing so pumped for you and good luck
20:30 - on this interview you're gonna crush it
20:32 - just go in with confidence one thing i
20:34 - like to say is when you're in the
20:35 - interview just think
20:36 - everything you're saying is just gold
20:38 - that's not the time to
20:40 - be skeptical and doubt yourself you can
20:42 - doubt yourself after and before
20:44 - but during it just everything that's
20:45 - coming out of your mouth is gold trust
20:47 - me on it it's gonna help you
20:48 - so much exactly game face when you walk
20:51 - into that room
20:52 - all right extensive color palette rishi
20:54 - what the hell is going on here man what
20:56 - am i looking at
20:56 - i think this was like so much needed
20:59 - like bootstrap has just few colors and
21:01 - like you know it was like
21:02 - really decent colors but like you know
21:04 - this was much needed like
21:06 - they extended their color palette and
21:07 - now you have a lot of options to choose
21:09 - from
21:09 - and i think this is a great addition to
21:12 - bootstrap
21:12 - so i'm super excited about this because
21:15 - like now you have a bunch of
21:16 - options to select with so i think the
21:19 - the reason to extend uh
21:20 - the color palette is amazing nice
21:24 - i agree with that the color palette was
21:26 - pretty boring before they added this so
21:27 - like really really nice to see that
21:29 - they've extended that out
21:30 - awesome yep yep that is awesome okay
21:34 - cool so yeah we want to definitely have
21:36 - some nicer colors now
21:38 - bootstrap svg icons we touched on it but
21:40 - this is what the library will look like
21:42 - for you guys when you're there
21:43 - in their documentation and you'll be
21:45 - able to pull it out now sunny
21:47 - just a question curiosity why would i
21:49 - use bootstrap icons instead of font
21:51 - awesome so good question
21:54 - so imagine you're using bootstrap to
21:56 - handle all the layout and everything
21:58 - keep it consistent like if you if you're
22:00 - already pulling in bootstrap from the
22:02 - cdn which means like how it's basically
22:04 - how you import bootstrap
22:05 - into your project you want to make sure
22:08 - you're not pulling in extra stuff so
22:10 - imagine you pulled in bootstrap
22:12 - to do your layout and then you handled
22:13 - uh font awesome as well
22:15 - you've now got two massive modules that
22:17 - you're kind of pulling into your project
22:18 - keep it all in one everything is
22:20 - included in bootstrap and also i think
22:23 - bootstrap have optimized quite well now
22:25 - um with the latest bootstrap 5 uh update
22:27 - because like i said they stripped out
22:29 - all the jquery so i think it would be a
22:32 - good good use case to actually go ahead
22:34 - and use the bootstrap
22:35 - icons instead awesome yeah i think and
22:37 - one of the
22:38 - yeah i think one of the most important
22:39 - reasons now to use bootstrap icons is
22:41 - like font awesome is launching font
22:43 - awesome six and then i'm pretty excited
22:44 - about both of this competing together
22:46 - and one of the most important thing is
22:48 - now with this like you know font awesome
22:49 - is
22:50 - little bit complicated to use now you
22:51 - have to create a key
22:53 - for you and then you they send you the
22:54 - kid in the email and then you use it and
22:56 - it's just kind of complicated but like
22:58 - when you use bootstrap it's super easy
23:00 - to use right
23:01 - so i was i'm super pumped about this so
23:03 - let's see like how it goes with font
23:05 - awesome and bootstrap
23:06 - got it hear you on that random 10 says i
23:10 - have experience
23:11 - in web development already and i have
23:13 - seen and subscribed to many dev channels
23:15 - but you guys are the best i discovered
23:18 - your channel just at the right time
23:20 - thank you thank you so much
23:23 - all right let's keep the value rocking
23:25 - and rolling you guys so
23:26 - now one thing that's really powerful is
23:29 - existing bootstrap themes
23:31 - so if you guys are working on projects
23:33 - and you want to build something
23:35 - just skip the work of having to do the
23:37 - whole thing
23:38 - and actually just get to the theme so
23:40 - here's an example of a
23:42 - theme right if you are trying to build
23:44 - an app and maybe you're trying to build
23:45 - a custom relationship management system
23:47 - or you're trying to build a system
23:48 - a dashboard that is showing people's
23:51 - weekly sales
23:52 - total orders and kind of this type of
23:55 - thing
23:56 - it's much better to just use a theme
23:58 - that already they have done
24:00 - all the hard work for you instead of you
24:02 - building it from scratch
24:04 - imagine how much time that would save
24:05 - you and then you can possibly be going
24:08 - on to
24:08 - another client instead of spending three
24:11 - months building out the front end
24:12 - what are your thoughts on it sonny 100
24:15 - dude so imagine guys like
24:17 - every single time you landed a client
24:19 - you had to spend like a four hour live
24:20 - session just getting the front end to
24:22 - look
24:22 - somewhat close to this right but you
24:24 - could skip all of that
24:26 - just by using the theme right and then
24:28 - you can reuse the theme
24:29 - change up the colors change up the way
24:31 - that things are laid out
24:32 - for different clients and you can pretty
24:34 - much have a reusable way
24:35 - of landing and finishing a lot of
24:37 - clients work now this is a really
24:39 - repeatable approach that i would
24:40 - recommend that everyone goes ahead and
24:42 - uses and guys also
24:43 - these are the people that build these
24:45 - teams are like front-end geniuses
24:47 - so they they account for all of the
24:49 - standards like you can see the drop
24:50 - shadows here are perfect
24:52 - they've got the cards looking really
24:53 - crisp that stuff is exactly things which
24:55 - we typically would overlook
24:57 - but it's really something that they're
24:58 - going to dial in and nail it so
25:01 - yeah um srindi asks hey guys can we use
25:04 - these icons on our clones like youtube
25:06 - spotify instead of material ui
25:09 - and the answer is that yes you can you
25:12 - can definitely use
25:14 - uh these icons these themes that's
25:16 - totally fine
25:17 - we still prefer material ui
25:20 - design just because it's easier less
25:22 - opinionated but there's no reason why if
25:24 - you want to use bootstrap 5 you can't
25:26 - and get the library uh react
25:29 - bootstrap and then follow the
25:31 - documentation there because that's going
25:32 - to make it a lot easier for you
25:33 - to plug and play bootstrap into your
25:37 - react app
25:38 - exactly definitely yeah and i think like
25:42 - the bootstrap teams like you can find
25:44 - out like
25:44 - a lot of teams it's not just limited
25:46 - teams there are like a lot of teams and
25:48 - it's not even expensive like if you land
25:49 - that line you just buy that team and
25:51 - it's not even expensive exactly
25:52 - you make your money back so damn fast
25:55 - yeah
25:57 - and um we also want to show you guys
25:58 - some of these where
26:00 - some demos of working bootstrap five so
26:03 - you guys can actually go to this link
26:05 - here
26:05 - i'll try to drop it in the chat as well
26:08 - but this is a link you guys can try to
26:10 - find just in the url and you can even
26:11 - just go to the documentation page
26:14 - if my youtube is gonna work fast enough
26:17 - man we gotta get a better and much
26:18 - faster computer because
26:20 - my computer is just maxing out with all
26:23 - of this stuff on it
26:25 - um so let's go back
26:28 - cool yep all right so right here
26:32 - so but the documentation guys it makes
26:34 - it a lot easier for you to understand i
26:36 - mean this is pretty much like how
26:37 - bootstrap
26:38 - 4 you you know you would write the
26:41 - code for popping up your buttons and
26:42 - then they'll like just pop up right here
26:44 - you guys can take a look at them
26:46 - i think what are some other things that
26:48 - are important to show them should we
26:49 - show them
26:50 - card drop downs models so a module guys
26:53 - is where we have a pop-up that appears
26:55 - on the screen now typically when you
26:56 - code a modal
26:57 - you gotta account for a lot of headaches
26:59 - what happens when they click outside the
27:00 - mode what happens when they click cancel
27:02 - button
27:02 - this or the the proceed to next button
27:04 - so these are all things that you need to
27:06 - account for so let's go ahead and show
27:08 - them
27:08 - a demo of the model that you get inside
27:10 - a bootstrap and it's really clean
27:12 - i've actually used it for production app
27:13 - before um so you can go ahead and click
27:16 - launch demo mode and you can see it
27:17 - look at that super nice and you even get
27:19 - an animation of it sliding in and out
27:21 - and i can click out of it and the code
27:23 - is just right here right
27:24 - and if you guys want to play around with
27:26 - it on your own you guys could actually
27:28 - go to codepen
27:29 - and then just copy and paste that code
27:32 - and it will like just work for you
27:34 - right yeah exactly and then it should
27:37 - just
27:37 - run it all for you provided you pull in
27:39 - the right css right just make sure that
27:41 - you
27:41 - link the css file and then once you do
27:44 - that which we can pull
27:45 - like maybe rishi you can link me to css
27:47 - and i can just drop that in
27:49 - and then it'll look great but without
27:50 - the css is going to look like crap but
27:52 - once the css file is there it's going to
27:54 - work but you guys can use this resource
27:56 - code pen and that should make your life
27:58 - a lot easier as well
28:00 - just wanted to highlight remember the
28:01 - dashboard that we showed a second ago
28:03 - let's hop over to that dashboard for a
28:05 - second
28:06 - all right let me go to this one right
28:09 - here we go
28:10 - yep so guys i just want to pay attention
28:12 - so there's a little mobile icon at the
28:14 - top which shows a preview of what it
28:15 - looks like in the mobile
28:19 - massive massive uh show of the
28:22 - responsive
28:22 - functionality when you're using
28:23 - bootstrap so that's something which
28:25 - comes straight out the box you get that
28:27 - out
28:28 - when using bootstrap and it's huge like
28:29 - even the slide-out bar oh everything
28:31 - damn you can't even make it dark mode
28:34 - yeah really nice right damn that is
28:37 - slick
28:37 - that is really slick yeah and if you
28:40 - land that to a client guys and say like
28:42 - here's your project done
28:43 - they'll be like wow okay this guy like
28:45 - spent a long time he done everything
28:46 - he'd done it all crystal clear
28:48 - the client just cares about the finished
28:49 - product it doesn't matter how you get
28:50 - there as long as it's answering
28:52 - everything that they need
28:53 - and it's a quality product so oh damn
28:56 - that looks nice these guys
28:58 - went ham with the front end and like
29:01 - this is so good even the demos jacked
29:04 - the demo is
29:05 - too good wow
29:09 - yeah a lot of people would just pay for
29:10 - this and get it like i would honestly
29:12 - pay for and get it
29:14 - yeah this looks cleaner than the stripe
29:16 - dashboard
29:17 - oh yeah easily easily this is amazing
29:20 - uh so somebody's saying hey can you also
29:22 - talk about the drop down
29:24 - nav bar and things like that so let's
29:26 - talk about let's go into the nav bar as
29:28 - well
29:29 - that's a good point actually yeah so
29:31 - i've coded an app bar a responsive one
29:33 - from scratch
29:33 - it can be a headache guys like and what
29:35 - we mean by this is like
29:36 - you know when you sort of shrink your
29:38 - page and you get that little
29:40 - sandwich bar icon yeah so i think i
29:43 - think it might be in this case they
29:45 - might be supporting it here
29:46 - so if we go down and check that oh
29:50 - nice yep
29:54 - yeah guys if you code that manually it's
29:56 - actually quite a little challenge to get
29:57 - that working so
29:58 - save yourself some hassle use something
30:00 - like um
30:02 - uh bootstrap to go ahead and fix that
30:03 - problem for yourself that is beautiful
30:05 - yeah that is awesome there are different
30:07 - kinds of navigation bar options so if
30:08 - you just scroll down close it like you
30:10 - can find out there are different kinds
30:11 - of
30:11 - options that you want you may want to
30:13 - use right for navigation bar
30:14 - different patterns different colors yep
30:17 - yeah true
30:18 - guys i just want to shout out i saw a
30:20 - few people wondering what the um
30:22 - that that theme sort of cost like guys
30:24 - how much let us know in the comments how
30:25 - much do you think that theme that we
30:27 - cause you just showed you cost so like
30:29 - that's like a full app theme
30:31 - can i take a guess too can rishi take a
30:32 - guess too yeah i
30:36 - feel like it's gonna be 50 bucks
30:38 - something like that
30:39 - okay yeah
30:43 - yeah i think it's not gonna be expensive
30:45 - it's gonna be like around 50 60 yeah
30:47 - that's what i'm guessing
30:48 - so 49 guys nice
30:53 - 49 to get a production now imagine you
30:55 - land a client for 500 dollars guys
30:57 - 49 take a cut of that you still got 450
31:01 - profit and they've saved you how much of
31:03 - that work so
31:04 - really really something to consider when
31:06 - you're trying to grow your business
31:08 - yep priya says to be honest a day before
31:10 - yesterday one of my friends suggested
31:12 - your youtube channel
31:13 - oh my god right now i feel very thankful
31:16 - for him and no words to describe about
31:18 - you guys you guys are
31:19 - rocking damn that is awesome thank you
31:22 - thank you
31:23 - and and to be honest like i have seen
31:25 - like on upwork and freelancer.com i have
31:27 - seen like clients who wanted to build
31:29 - like an admin panel like this and they
31:31 - pay like 500
31:32 - bucks right and all you need to do is
31:33 - like just buy this for 50 bucks and just
31:35 - connect the back end with front and
31:36 - there you go like you don't even need to
31:38 - spend a lot of time and you make 500
31:39 - right
31:40 - you just find 15 you make 500. and
31:42 - elijah says 49
31:44 - for that is a steal considering it would
31:46 - take me hours
31:47 - so now imagine if you guys had to
31:49 - develop your own theme
31:51 - of this caliber i mean this is easily
31:54 - two to four hundred hours of work
31:56 - and assuming you're actually good at
31:58 - what you're doing
32:00 - and that's when you would actually get
32:02 - something like this so now just do the
32:03 - math
32:04 - right so let's put in let's say 300
32:06 - hours of work
32:07 - at let's just say you say your rate is
32:10 - worth 30 dollars
32:11 - an hour uh yeah you know the the the
32:14 - time value of this is really nine
32:16 - thousand dollars
32:17 - yeah so much better to get something up
32:19 - and running and then your clients will
32:21 - be
32:21 - blown away as well guys don't spam in
32:23 - the chat you're gonna get blocked so for
32:24 - example he-man just spammed in the chat
32:26 - he's gonna get blocked
32:27 - but uh you know i see the positive
32:29 - comments you guys have coming in so keep
32:30 - the positivity
32:32 - going guys and just let's keep the
32:33 - quality of the chat really clean
32:36 - amazing awesome uh frankie
32:39 - i need your help with the chat because
32:40 - some people are going crazy
32:42 - all right beautiful so let's keep it
32:46 - rocking and rolling so
32:47 - themes are amazing use them abuse them
32:50 - and um leverage them and they're going
32:53 - to help you
32:54 - get a lot of clients and make a lot of
32:56 - money fast
32:57 - so yeah now why use bootstrap
33:01 - tell me about it guys yeah so it's super
33:04 - easy to get started
33:05 - i think we literally just uh copy in the
33:08 - cdn imports right rishi inside of our
33:11 - html file
33:12 - that's it and that's literally it you
33:13 - pull it in that simply and then you can
33:15 - pretty much start using it straight away
33:16 - so it's even quicker than
33:18 - how we would do and if you're using
33:19 - react it's literally npm install react
33:21 - bootstrap
33:22 - and you pretty much have the module
33:24 - inside and everything works from there
33:26 - the documentation is amazing so we just
33:27 - showed you a demo of how you can have
33:29 - a lot of those demos you can actually
33:31 - see they've got the example code
33:32 - most of the time when i was using it
33:34 - i'll just check out the dum the example
33:36 - code
33:36 - and just change it for what i needed it
33:38 - for and that's it like you don't need to
33:39 - kind of dive in a bit further than that
33:41 - you can start they've got styling
33:43 - components um for pretty much
33:44 - everything you need so they have nav
33:46 - bars models buttons everything that
33:48 - you're going to find in a use case for
33:50 - including forms they're going to have
33:52 - that support so
33:53 - something to definitely go ahead and i
33:55 - think that's really simply
33:57 - um enough to just show you why you would
33:59 - go ahead and use it
34:00 - as opposed to not using it and this is
34:02 - pretty much how simple it is to get
34:04 - started on it right that's what you were
34:05 - talking
34:06 - about exactly yeah so if you're using
34:08 - mpm
34:09 - it's npm install bootstrap and on the
34:10 - next slide we actually show you
34:12 - the uh how you can just do a cdn import
34:15 - so
34:16 - just those four lines of code and you've
34:17 - got the css and the javascript
34:19 - yep that's it and it allows you to so
34:23 - like here are the top reasons to be
34:25 - using bootstrap you guys if you guys
34:26 - want to write it down
34:27 - or mentally remember it it's all good
34:30 - but one of the biggest reasons why you
34:31 - guys want to be using
34:32 - bootstrap is actually because you can
34:36 - actually build sites
34:37 - fast so that rapid development can
34:40 - actually be
34:41 - very powerful for you guys so here you
34:43 - know you can build
34:44 - and and you can build responsive sites
34:46 - fast so you know whether it's
34:48 - mobile um you want to go mobile like
34:50 - it's going to be mobile responsive it's
34:52 - going to look good on an
34:53 - ipad it's going to look good on an
34:55 - iphone or an android
34:57 - or your imac or your windows computer
35:00 - browser compatibility is going to be
35:02 - there minus of course
35:03 - um internet explorer 10 or internet
35:06 - explorer 11.
35:07 - yep and then um the turnaround time is
35:11 - fast right so what does that mean
35:13 - for your bank sonny so
35:16 - guys let's say you have five clients
35:18 - right you have five people that want
35:19 - websites built for you one wants a
35:21 - dashboard one more
35:22 - portfolio one on some other website like
35:24 - you've got you've got a bunch of work on
35:26 - your hands now you could either sit
35:27 - there and spend time doing flexbox doing
35:29 - all that stuff
35:30 - or you could use bootstrap pump out
35:32 - these uh these apps
35:33 - very quickly and as we say on the last
35:35 - point with the premium templates
35:37 - available it makes that very easy like
35:39 - we just showed to do that
35:40 - now if that means that you can take on
35:42 - five clients very quick in a month you
35:44 - might be able to increase the number of
35:45 - clients you're handling a month
35:47 - which means that more money goes into
35:48 - your pocket right
35:50 - and also guys just remember once you buy
35:52 - a premium template you can reuse that
35:54 - template there's nothing saying that you
35:55 - can't right
35:56 - you can go ahead and reuse it and then
35:57 - you can make more money from it so
35:59 - it's like an investment it's an
36:00 - investment in yourself when you buy that
36:02 - template
36:03 - think of it that way and it makes the
36:04 - decision super simple
36:07 - yep dev zio says i pay 100 for 400
36:10 - of work off that so that's a good way to
36:13 - think about
36:14 - using bootstrap or using themes inside
36:16 - of bootstrap
36:17 - you know you it's a good deal for you if
36:20 - you can make things fast for me
36:22 - speed really matters and yeah but you
36:24 - can be moving on to the second or third
36:26 - client instead of just slaving over
36:28 - one thing for a really long time so i
36:30 - think that's super important
36:32 - and this is one of the use cases we
36:34 - showed you guys of it
36:35 - and then here are some blog examples of
36:37 - how you can actually be using it so
36:40 - here is a good blog by it's called milo
36:42 - and
36:43 - uh do we actually is this a link sunny
36:45 - yeah it's clickable
36:47 - okay so let's actually click it and uh
36:50 - let's see maybe we can drop it in
36:51 - chat below as well dang that chat is
36:55 - super slow youtube needs to work on
36:58 - their chat it's so
37:00 - poor like the experience of writing in
37:02 - there whereas twitch is just
37:04 - so damn fast so fast
37:08 - but uh here is an example i dropped in
37:09 - the chat below too you guys can actually
37:11 - check it out and what it looks like and
37:13 - i think it's pretty good it's showing
37:14 - you like
37:15 - you know here's the three column one and
37:17 - i think you should be able to click it
37:18 - and see how three columns work
37:21 - yeah and it's and it's very easy to do
37:24 - things into two columns or three columns
37:26 - right sunny with this and full widths
37:28 - super easy super easy so you see when
37:29 - you buy these templates they give you a
37:31 - bunch of different variations
37:32 - and demos for those variations with the
37:35 - code and everything
37:36 - alongside it so to get something looking
37:38 - the way you want it it's very very easy
37:40 - using the demos that they give you so
37:42 - definitely go check them out guys and
37:43 - it's just quite fun as well to go around
37:44 - and play with the templates

41:48 - sessions on pwa which is progressive web
41:51 - apps
41:52 - and yeah i think at some point we're
41:53 - going to do something with react
41:55 - native as well cool
41:58 - all right so let's keep it rocking and
42:00 - rolling so can we
42:02 - go ahead go ahead yeah sorry i think
42:05 - yeah this is one of the most
42:06 - important and most useful case of like
42:09 - bootstrap because like building an
42:10 - e-commerce site
42:12 - is like so much harder like when you
42:14 - have to build but with bootstrap like
42:16 - you can see that it's just 49 and you
42:17 - just buy it and you just enhance it
42:19 - modify it and there you go like you have
42:20 - an ecommerce site right
42:22 - so i think this is one of the most
42:24 - important use case of bootstrap
42:27 - yep 100 i think that's really important
42:29 - a lot of people want to build bootstraps
42:31 - uh
42:31 - e-commerce sites like amazon you know or
42:34 - like
42:35 - shopify and a lot of freelancing jobs
42:37 - are out there so
42:38 - bootstrap is really good for that what's
42:40 - going on here
42:42 - so yeah portfolio like yeah i helped
42:44 - build my portfolio with bootstrap and a
42:46 - lot of people build a portfolio with
42:47 - bootstrap so like if you want to build
42:49 - the online portfolio with bootstrap and
42:50 - you just have a little knowledge about
42:52 - like coding or like uh very less
42:54 - knowledge about coding just go to
42:55 - bootstrap
42:56 - teams and just find a good portfolio
42:57 - before you download that part and there
42:59 - are a lot of free portfolio as well kazi
43:01 - you know
43:01 - like you can download a lot of free
43:03 - portfolio for you and then you can just
43:05 - edit that portfolio modify that
43:06 - portfolio and then you have online
43:07 - portfolio and like you know making that
43:09 - online portfolio is one of the most
43:11 - important thing when you are applying
43:12 - for those developer jobs right
43:13 - because like they always want to see
43:15 - where you stand out like you know
43:17 - so i think it's easy to do that with
43:20 - bootstrap
43:21 - super super easy yep i think that's
43:24 - super important to be able to do all of
43:26 - this stuff you guys i'm reading your
43:27 - guys's chat and we're trying to engage
43:29 - with you guys as much in chat as
43:30 - possible as well
43:31 - we got another donation by sahil thank
43:34 - you so much for that he says love you
43:35 - guys
43:36 - keep going and we will so
43:39 - guys just to recap right portfolio you
43:42 - can build e-commerce sites you can build
43:43 - blocks
43:45 - i can hear echo
43:49 - rishi you want to mute yourself
43:53 - cool um i was hearing echoes i think
43:55 - maybe your headsets came out or
43:57 - something
43:59 - or audio maybe i don't know just double
44:01 - check please and then we'll try to make
44:02 - it work because
44:02 - now my echo is gone so guys all these
44:06 - platforms you can you can all of these
44:07 - types of apps you can actually build
44:09 - with bootstrap
44:10 - and some beautiful projects using
44:12 - bootstrap you can build
44:14 - now the second reason you guys should be
44:16 - learning bootstrap is actually the
44:19 - powerful grid system that they have
44:21 - so this grid system actually is even
44:24 - faster than the css
44:26 - grid system so it has some really
44:28 - powerful professional
44:29 - use cases for why you should be using
44:32 - this and you can actually build mobile
44:33 - friendly sites
44:34 - using the powerful 12 column system so a
44:37 - lot of big sites like
44:39 - spotify or instagram or a lot of these
44:41 - guys that are using bootstrap
44:42 - are actually using it um and you know
44:45 - like that
44:46 - it's faster than the css grid which is
44:48 - something i just mentioned a little bit
44:49 - ago
44:50 - and real real fast and rishi did we have
44:53 - demos prepared or should we just go on
44:55 - to the next slides
44:57 - oh yeah we can just go into the next
44:59 - slides but like yeah just to add to that
45:01 - grid system is like super super powerful
45:03 - guys like i have been working with the
45:05 - grid system and the way bootstrap has
45:06 - improvised and even in bootstrap
45:08 - one of the major changes are there
45:10 - enhancing the grid system right they
45:11 - launched the flexbox they launched the
45:12 - grid system now they're enhancing the
45:14 - grid system
45:14 - and it's super easy to use like we don't
45:16 - have the demo but like i can just
45:18 - explain
45:18 - that all you need to do if you want to
45:20 - use a grid system is like you define a
45:22 - deal and you just give a raw class to
45:24 - that and then
45:25 - you can give a number of uh columns to
45:28 - that
45:28 - or maybe if you want to just quickly
45:29 - show that gaza you can just go to the
45:31 - codepen and like we can show them like
45:33 - it's
45:33 - it's yeah it's super powerful super
45:36 - powerful you guys it's really really
45:38 - powerful
45:38 - um yeah if you want to drop me a link i
45:40 - can probably show them
45:42 - in the slack channel but i'm going to
45:43 - keep it moving just for
45:45 - every just so we can bring more value to
45:46 - everybody and guys
45:48 - it's also open source and community
45:50 - driven
45:51 - and so what that means is there's
45:53 - massive massive support for it
45:55 - you know on github in their issues you
45:58 - can even go to github
45:59 - issues to get fixes to your problems
46:01 - their documentation is great
46:03 - so what that means is that there are a
46:04 - few things
46:06 - one it has excellent support so it even
46:09 - has great support for react
46:11 - and you guys can actually use react
46:13 - bootstrap
46:14 - this is a library that they have for and
46:17 - it just allows you to plug and play
46:18 - bootstrap into your react app
46:20 - and then no licensing issues with
46:23 - clients
46:23 - which means that you don't have to worry
46:25 - about purchasing a license
46:27 - or anything like that you can actually
46:30 - just use bootstrap with clients anytime
46:32 - the themes and then you're good to go
46:36 - and this is an alpha build of bootstrap
46:39 - so this is something we touched based on
46:40 - earlier and alpha build means it's the
46:43 - first
46:44 - working version of an application so you
46:47 - know right now
46:48 - it might be a little bit unstable it
46:50 - might be a little bit you know something
46:52 - might be wrong with it as i start to
46:53 - work out the kinks and go from alpha
46:56 - version to a beta version and then
46:58 - eventually going on to a fully stable
47:00 - version
47:01 - but i think you guys should definitely
47:03 - give it a try and use
47:05 - bootstrap 5 because i think you know
47:07 - they wouldn't release alpha build if
47:08 - it's not good or useful for most
47:11 - use cases i think 99 of you guys
47:14 - alpha build you guys can actually use it
47:17 - trust it
47:18 - i think people who are working with
47:20 - massive companies where you have
47:21 - millions of customers
47:22 - maybe you probably won't move to an
47:24 - alpha build you won't use an alpha build
47:26 - because you want to make sure that
47:28 - your version is extremely stable
47:33 - all right because if you want to go to
47:34 - the codepen and you want to show them i
47:36 - just dropped it
47:37 - dropped you the codepen link and now we
47:39 - can show them the
47:41 - or maybe it's open it's open i guess
47:43 - okay i just clicked it
47:45 - okay so now just scroll down i can
47:47 - explain quickly just scroll down in the
47:48 - code
47:49 - okay got it html file or maybe you can
47:52 - just like minimize css in javascript
47:53 - because we just have html
47:55 - okay
47:59 - yeah that's how you can do okay so now i
48:01 - can explain that
48:02 - so the way you use grid system is guys
48:04 - like it's super easy like if you see
48:06 - i created a view and uh so bootstrap
48:09 - works with the classes right all you
48:10 - need to do is like all you you
48:11 - just need to define classes right now
48:13 - the way it works is
48:14 - that uh uh you i first gave
48:18 - i first define a view and that the class
48:20 - name of the deal is row and underneath
48:22 - that
48:23 - so there is one row i said i said to the
48:25 - browser that there is one row
48:26 - now underneath whatever columns i need
48:29 - all i need to do is like give class
48:30 - column to that and even if you have like
48:33 - if you want if you want
48:34 - to add more columns to that you can add
48:36 - one more p tag and you just give one
48:37 - column
48:38 - so that's how like you know there's one
48:40 - draw and then there is number of columns
48:42 - and that's
48:42 - how much easier it is to use grid like
48:45 - before like bootstrap
48:46 - you need to go to css you need to define
48:49 - that display grid and then grid template
48:51 - column
48:51 - and then one fr one fr and stuff like
48:54 - that but with this like this
48:55 - that's it and the pg warning bg danger
48:57 - and bg info are the bootstrap colors
48:59 - that i'm talking about right
49:00 - vg means background and warning means
49:02 - the yellow color yep so this warning
49:04 - right over here
49:05 - is how we're getting this yellow color
49:07 - right there the danger
49:09 - is how we're getting that red color and
49:12 - then
49:12 - just because just by even adding the p
49:14 - tags you're breaking it up into its own
49:16 - columns right
49:18 - yep i'm just breaking it down so super
49:20 - easy to use the grid system guys i love
49:22 - that that is so awesome
49:24 - um i think that demo is super helpful so
49:27 - hopefully guys
49:28 - this uh all of these slides were
49:31 - valuable for you guys
49:33 - and gave you guys insight on how
49:34 - bootstrap
49:36 - 5 and bootstrap works in general and why
49:39 - maybe you might want to actually use
49:41 - bootstrap 5 and learn about it because
49:44 - you know even though with a lot of our
49:45 - clones we're teaching you materially why
49:47 - and i think material ui is fantastic
49:48 - you kind of stick with it and be totally
49:50 - fine material you guys developed by
49:52 - google
49:53 - but what's cool about i think even
49:55 - learning bootstrap 5 is because
49:57 - you're not going to be handicapped if
49:59 - you go to a job and they're using
50:00 - bootstrap 5 you can plug and play and
50:02 - learn their system and you guys can
50:04 - actually get that job still
50:06 - so i think knowing bootstrap 5 you don't
50:09 - have to be a pro at it but knowing it
50:11 - is not a bad idea so for you guys to
50:13 - maybe build a demo app
50:15 - with bootstrap 5 or even some of the
50:17 - clones you built the amazon clone that
50:18 - we taught you guys to build
50:20 - the spotify clone that we taught you to
50:22 - build you can probably go back to them
50:23 - and turn them into bootstrap 5
50:26 - instead of material ui and learn it that
50:28 - way right and just to kind of recap
50:30 - everything we talked about
50:31 - top companies are using bootstrap right
50:33 - it's responsive
50:34 - it's fast jquery was removed they
50:37 - switched to vanilla
50:38 - they dropped internet explorer now they
50:40 - have svg icons responsive font sizes
50:43 - which was huge
50:44 - so if we go past all of this custom css
50:47 - variables so you guys can actually have
50:48 - variables like background color
50:50 - the color palettes are great uh themes
50:53 - you can use them and actually get
50:54 - started with bootstrap super fast
50:56 - and up and running with massive projects
50:59 - getting started is super easy npm
51:01 - install
51:02 - here's a cdn code you can just drop in
51:03 - and be good to go
51:05 - build sites fast was one of the reasons
51:07 - we said you guys should use bootstrap
51:09 - reason two was it has a powerful grid
51:11 - system
51:12 - and this is why it's important i think
51:14 - reason three that we said
51:16 - is that it's open source and community
51:18 - driven so you guys can actually use that
51:20 - to your advantage
51:21 - and build amazing things
51:25 - so hopefully guys that was something
51:28 - that was super valuable for you guys
51:30 - um i'm gonna share something go ahead
51:32 - rishi
51:34 - yeah so i just wanted to say that cause
51:36 - like if you go to that code pen again
51:37 - like i have one more demo for flexbox so
51:39 - that i can also show them flexbox and
51:41 - great voter for them simon
51:44 - yeah just refresh that page
51:51 - yeah so now just scroll down and the way
51:53 - you use flexbox in bootstrap
51:55 - is like uh just scroll down in the code
51:59 - all you all you say is like how you you
52:02 - know how you used to say uh
52:03 - in css that display flex all you need to
52:05 - say is d that's flash
52:07 - and then justify content center so this
52:10 - actually makes it
52:11 - much easier oh that's nice i didn't
52:13 - actually not know that
52:15 - oh let me actually i'm sorry they were
52:17 - they weren't seeing the screen now talk
52:19 - about it
52:20 - yeah okay so if you want to guys you if
52:22 - you want to use flexbox it's this easy
52:24 - like you know how you have to go to css
52:26 - if you don't use bootstrap you have to
52:27 - say that display flex and then you have
52:29 - to go and tell that justify content
52:31 - enter
52:31 - in bootstrap like you just say that b
52:33 - does flex and then you just say justify
52:35 - connect center and that's it like
52:36 - it's using flexbox so the most powerful
52:39 - tool of css that is boot uh that is
52:41 - created that is flexible
52:42 - bootstrap made it super easy for us to
52:45 - use like grid and
52:46 - uh flexbox uh so that like you know it's
52:49 - highly highly recommend to use but
52:51 - uh to use uh bootstrap uh for
52:54 - one all of your projects i would highly
52:56 - recommend that yep
52:58 - awesome now hopefully guys that brought
53:00 - you a lot of value
53:02 - if this was valuable for you guys can
53:04 - you guys please let us know in the
53:05 - comments if this brought you even
53:07 - just a tiny bit of value would love to
53:09 - know what you guys thought about this
53:11 - presentation we spent a lot of time
53:12 - putting it together we wanted to make
53:14 - sure it was entertaining

53:18 - just want to know some feedback in terms
53:20 - of did you guys enjoy this what could we

53:56 - it's a road map to going from
53:58 - you know if you're at zero dollars right
53:59 - now to going to a hundred thousand
54:01 - dollars now whether it takes you
54:02 - you know one month one year three years
54:05 - five years
