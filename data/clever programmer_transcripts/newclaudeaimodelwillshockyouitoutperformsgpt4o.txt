00:00 - Sonet versus Chad gp4 who is going to
00:04 - win we came across an amazing video by
00:06 - Ai sech and we were going to do one on
00:09 - our own but his video is so good
00:10 - honestly that I'm just excited to watch
00:13 - it myself for the first time along with
00:15 - Nas and that we just want to react to it
00:17 - let's [ __ ] go let's go baby so this
00:21 - is a video by AI search on Claude 3.5
00:25 - this new AI destroys GPT this is a brand
00:27 - new model that Claude released
00:30 - all right can it create a 3D first
00:34 - shoter oh wait what the [ __ ] let's try
00:37 - to make this let's do it okay so I'm
00:40 - trying to make a tic tac toe game but
00:41 - it's not allowing me to do that in
00:43 - Claude but I bet we can make cuz I want
00:45 - to be able to code within here yeah
00:47 - which would be sick and I think I heard
00:49 - something called artifacts so I think we
00:51 - have to go enable it so I'm going to
00:52 - click thing feature preview uhhuh yo
00:57 - okay so let's check that out we did do
00:58 - our research beforehand
01:00 - there we go all right so artifacts are
01:03 - on so now so try to say like in
01:06 - JavaScript cuz probably I'm not sure if
01:08 - we can do it in Python
01:11 - so no create a new create a new I have
01:14 - to create a new chat you think I think
01:15 - so yes okay so let's start a new chat
01:18 - build a tic tactoe game yep enter please
01:22 - go um should be on the right hand side
01:24 - no like how that guy
01:27 - has let's go dude
01:30 - that's so sick that's
01:32 - wild how does it just
01:35 - know oh what the
01:39 - [ __ ] this is so lit that's sick what the
01:43 - [ __ ] okay come on [ __ ] I'm going to
01:45 - beat your ass here all right go for it
01:47 - all right
01:49 - go uh go go go go
01:53 - go oh come on you little come on oh sick
01:58 - yes damn it all right all right oh yeah
02:01 - not it's not going to happen huh yeah no
02:03 - I think you got me [ __ ] [ __ ] let's
02:09 - go oh that makes me so happy oh that's
02:12 - so
02:14 - funny all right okay so what about pack
02:17 - okay make me pack my dude not having to
02:20 - code and it doing it is actually a l
02:24 - right this is pretty it does in Python
02:27 - and can you ask me to do it in
02:28 - JavaScript it is Javascript no this oh
02:31 - this is oh [ __ ] I don't have I don't
02:33 - have my glasses on I don't know how I
02:35 - don't know how I did the last
02:37 - one
02:39 - dude oh my God
02:44 - bro what the heck dude use arrow keys
02:48 - and it just like Works dude and it's
02:50 - really good and it even has a score and
02:53 - the score is really good too what the
02:55 - hell by the way you're not paused right
02:57 - no no no no it's gone oh thank God yeah
03:00 - yeah I know I
03:01 - know oh oh can you ask it ask it to add
03:05 - um enemies enemies add enemies no dude
03:08 - it will not get that there's no way it
03:10 - will get that dude dude I'm like a
03:13 - little kid I'm so excited there's look
03:15 - how fast it is too this shit's on GPT 40
03:19 - dude I mean yeah especially with like
03:21 - ability to write such strong code where
03:23 - it just work and then just run it and it
03:25 - runs it so quickly it runs it faster
03:27 - than [ __ ] running an nextjs
03:28 - application and waiting for compile even
03:31 - to do yarn Dev and all that yeah I agree
03:33 - how whoa
03:37 - no I mean yeah it's it's
03:40 - there oh oh these guys are scary as [ __ ]
03:44 - oh dude oh they're going oh oh oh they
03:48 - see me they actually can see me you
03:50 - think so yes that's why they attract
03:52 - they get attracted right when I come so
03:54 - like when I'm near enough it gets
03:56 - attracted to me if you're not near
03:58 - enough then oh oh this guy is going look
04:01 - yeah this guy is on game
04:04 - over I can't move anymore dude this is
04:08 - this is next level about can it add
04:09 - sounds can you add sounds oh can we do
04:13 - you think it has sounds I don't know
04:16 - let's see if it
04:20 - does actually super curious to see if it
04:22 - has sounds yeah enemies and sound click
04:26 - to open component it's it's it's in down
04:28 - the right corner
04:30 - there this is so fun coding bro look uh
04:34 - the Git You Know G reposit uh control so
04:38 - you can actually go back to the previous
04:40 - version and the version before that and
04:42 - what happens when I download oh
04:43 - downloads the code the file oh that is
04:45 - so cool and can put it into actual app
04:47 - so this is version two is it playing and
04:49 - this is version three I don't hear
04:51 - anything oh you can hear it oh it
04:56 - broke did it break I heard it I heard it
04:59 - yeah it it something happened let's open
05:02 - it
05:05 - again dude that's so
05:09 - cool dude this is mind-blowing dude we
05:12 - need
05:13 - to I lost
05:16 - oh that was so cool so if I can go to so
05:20 - I can go version two and I can just
05:22 - instantly be playing version two and
05:24 - version one and it's just running like
05:26 - it just is so not only am I able to go
05:29 - you know like nobody ever checks out the
05:31 - previous and they have to check out then
05:33 - you have to do like
05:34 - compile this is just
05:36 - running dude this is adding a new
05:39 - dimension of excitement for me for
05:41 - coding building Le learning coding
05:42 - through this would be so much fun I feel
05:44 - like yeah I mean this is like my brother
05:46 - can now code you know like everybody can
05:48 - code they were so [ __ ] developers
05:51 - excited dude [ __ ]
05:53 - developers um this is exciting
05:58 - actually wow okay so let's pause this
06:03 - how do you pause
06:04 - it
06:06 - refresh okay so download file what does
06:09 - that does it gives me the TSX file file
06:11 - wait text oh text file oh TSX file oh
06:15 - it's a typescript file no that's a react
06:18 - typescript file
06:22 - yeah okay what kind of code does it
06:24 - actually have can I look at the code for
06:26 - a second what the [ __ ] is it saying here
06:29 - look look at that here's are The Crazy
06:31 - Ones the Rebels the troublemakers the
06:33 - round pegs and the square holes the ones
06:34 - who see things different that's your
06:36 - script dude no this is not mine this is
06:39 - uh this is uh Steve Jobs uh this is
06:44 - Steve Jobs speech what the hell that's
06:46 - kind of funny why do they have yeah why
06:47 - is it in here can you open in notes or
06:50 - VI code
06:52 - code or cursor that is funny what is
06:55 - that yo why is it I don't see none here
06:59 - yeah yeah but why is it there what the
07:01 - hell oh is this is this a Mac thing is
07:03 - it like a Easter egg or something dude I
07:05 - think it's a Mac thing which is like if
07:07 - if I can't display the actual it just
07:09 - does this maybe a new OS they give
07:11 - homage too dude that's actually a lit
07:15 - Steve Jobs that is f fascinating he's
07:17 - [ __ ] in our computer um okay so great
07:21 - so I can copy so code and then there's
07:23 - the code is actually it's a react code
07:25 - can I look at the actual code mhm dude
07:28 - this is a react code they're actually
07:29 - running react in the back end yeah
07:32 - they're running something the [ __ ] how
07:35 - this is react in the back end yeah that
07:38 - is weird like to run a react application
07:41 - and deploy that fast so then I can like
07:45 - okay so build a app where every time I
07:49 - hit the button it
07:53 - increments a d you can you're going to
07:55 - have to give it some some harder [ __ ] to
07:56 - do no I know but I'm just seeing like
07:59 - cuz then we can just straight up be
08:00 - building react components in here we
08:02 - don't even have to run react code on our
08:04 - own Compu see right away oh my God bro
08:06 - this is like can you ask it to use
08:08 - Tailwind CSS and see how that looks like
08:11 - use Tailwind
08:12 - [Music]
08:14 - CSS and it's so fast too and look at its
08:17 - styling too it styling is way better
08:19 - than how the other GPT stuff yeah very
08:21 - clean oh my god with drop shadows and
08:25 - everything bro my UI problems are gone
08:26 - forever dude finally dude I don't have
08:29 - to
08:29 - [Laughter]
08:32 - um make it dark
08:37 - theme oh no way and then we got versions
08:39 - on that you think it's going to make it
08:41 - happen so not only that but we can go so
08:43 - we have different wow dude artifacts is
08:46 - so clean it's like different coding
08:48 - projects so if I go in tic-tac-toe the
08:51 - tic-tac-toe is its own game preview yeah
08:54 - and it knows if I go to simple Pac-Man
08:56 - it has its own Version Control right
08:58 - here and it's own code and the game and
09:01 - then if I go to simp clot is oh my God
09:05 - that looks God that's beautiful CLA is
09:08 - way too lit guys add sounds for
09:11 - increment and decrements and add
09:14 - decrements GPT for all you need to
09:17 - speaked your [ __ ] up wow this is
09:27 - sick it's doing something with sound
09:30 - inside of react so I'm seeing gain node
09:32 - oscillator let's
09:34 - see how does it have the length of those
09:36 - sounds is a question I don't know and
09:39 - why is it blurry like that I'm curious I
09:40 - have no idea kind of
09:42 - [Music]
09:45 - weird
09:47 - wow you can build so much so something
09:51 - about so there's some I wonder how it's
09:53 - creating sound I Don't Know audio and
09:56 - it's but look at this oscillator it's
09:59 - like an oscillator or something also
10:01 - that type sign MH so I feel like you
10:04 - know how for example you can create
10:06 - animations CSS animations that are like
10:09 - exponential ramp to value at time
10:11 - interesting I think it's actually
10:13 - defining like an actual sound like you
10:15 - know how you can define an animation CSS
10:18 - yeah yeah yeah it's defining an actual
10:19 - sound and how the sound is working yeah
10:21 - which is sick that is really interesting
10:24 - this is an oscillator function and then
10:26 - it uses the oscillation cuz obviously it
10:28 - does not like scroll up does it import
10:31 - anything no nothing nothing everything
10:33 - is is it able to import stuff ask it can
10:38 - you uh import a library a sound Library
10:41 - can you use a sound
10:46 - Library let's see if we can do
10:50 - that like can it use howler DJs oh there
10:53 - you go oh
10:55 - D dud just read your mind no no no no no
10:58 - no
10:59 - no ah but then you still need you see
11:02 - it's trying to hit placeholder yeah so
11:05 - no I don't I mean I don't think so but
11:08 - yeah who the [ __ ] knows yeah no no no no
11:10 - no dude it the errors it gives you are
11:13 - so um friendly as well look at the error
11:17 - is super friendly wow this is better
11:19 - than [ __ ] next sh yes errors yeah
11:21 - they looks so
11:25 - friendly ask it this I mean this could
11:27 - be crazy ask it um make this component
11:30 - work in react
11:33 - flow
11:36 - um well because it doesn't have access
11:38 - to
11:39 - libraries so we just saw like we just
11:42 - saw right it didn't do howler because it
11:45 - doesn't have access to the library won
11:48 - ACC there no ability at all yeah so it
11:50 - won't have access to library that's why
11:51 - it's like trying to write it from
11:52 - scratch oh I see that's unfortunate that
11:55 - would be cool if it did though yeah that
11:57 - would be really cool I mean I'm sure
11:59 - they'll start to add that over yeah but
12:01 - they're just trying to do it where like
12:03 - they don't have any dependencies and
12:05 - everything it makes sense cuz like
12:06 - installing all these dependencies
12:08 - themselves is just such a crazy task and
12:10 - keeping all that in check and keeping
12:12 - that updated is such a crazy task too
12:15 - all right let's continue with the video
12:16 - let's go dude three we're 3 seconds in 3
12:20 - seconds and this is like 36 minutes left
12:23 - yeah person
12:25 - shooter oh my God oh my God
12:29 - can it create a 3D interactive particle
12:33 - Cloud oh my God yeah all those things
12:37 - are actually great um I wonder so that
12:40 - makes me like can I create a um build a
12:44 - pong
12:45 - game um I'm sure that that will be super
12:48 - easy for it to do
12:51 - um because when he said particle I just
12:54 - thought like you know something that can
12:56 - have gravity and things like that what
12:57 - if we build oh what about like a Tetris
12:59 - game dude you know how I wanted to see
13:02 - what what would happen if my mom I and
13:05 - an elephant fell plane yeah first let's
13:09 - actually [ __ ] do that here dude let's
13:11 - animate that yeah holy [ __ ] holy
13:15 - smokes oh dude I bet we could build a
13:18 - chest game too oh dude let's play
13:20 - against each other come on you think it
13:22 - works oh I'm winning dude oh what the
13:25 - [ __ ] I have 55 points get wrecked oh
13:27 - [ __ ] you oh what the [ __ ] [ __ ] why are
13:29 - you winning dude oh
13:33 - bit oh get [ __ ] on I don't know get [ __ ]
13:37 - on I don't know why I put like oh oh oh
13:41 - oh what what now can you hold on one
13:44 - second I don't know why it put on like
13:47 - um 100 Balls or like 5 spe like look at
13:51 - the speed mode on here dude it's going
13:56 - insane um this is way too fun guys oh
14:00 - yeah okay so if so I want to see a
14:05 - physics
14:06 - thing where if me my mom um I'm 63
14:16 - mhm no wasn't listening
14:21 - um 140
14:24 - lb and my mom is 51
14:31 - and 50 lb uh and an
14:35 - elephant jumped out of an airplane who
14:39 - would fall
14:42 - first okay let's see I'm curious what it
14:47 - says
14:48 - Ah it says I cannot provide an accurate
14:52 - physics simulation for that scenario as
14:53 - it involves potentially harmful
14:57 - situations okay
15:00 - let's create a oh there we go feather
15:03 - ball and an
15:05 - anvil oh see I don't really believe
15:09 - that's going to be true man uh you have
15:11 - to add friction so like but this is cool
15:13 - I can actually learn physics for the
15:15 - first time sit here and figured this
15:18 - [ __ ] out can you add like ask it to add
15:21 - wind friction like actual wind and air
15:26 - friction um we're not physicists so wind
15:29 - friction and air friction might be the
15:31 - same thing but who cares because the
15:33 - thing
15:34 - is yeah because that's going to be
15:36 - that's going to make it
15:38 - different whoa the thing is I think it's
15:41 - also the gravity air density drag
15:43 - coefficient pixels per met beautiful
15:45 - yeah there we go and then now we should
15:48 - be able to see it potentially cuz I
15:50 - think that is a big factor who do you
15:53 - think will win who do you think will win
15:54 - oh no no before we do it actually oh
15:56 - dude you can select the win speed look
15:58 - you can actually drag it oh that's funny
16:00 - that's so my guess would be the heaviest
16:02 - thing so the Anvil in this case my guess
16:05 - the Anvil you think the Anvil will be
16:07 - the one to actually win yeah you guys
16:10 - drop your thoughts down belows you would
16:15 - win I think the thing that has the least
16:18 - amount of friction will win I wish I
16:20 - knew what the width of these these guys
16:22 - are the biggest one is Anvil ball is
16:23 - middle and feather so feather ball and
16:26 - Anvil which one do you think will win I
16:28 - think think ball will win
16:35 - okay the [ __ ] okay that simulation is
16:39 - broken it definitely broke interesting
16:42 - tell it that it's
16:45 - broken uh I think I understand this
16:48 - point let's hold on let's see simulation
16:50 - is
16:51 - broken when I click Start It All
16:56 - vanishes and so let's see if it can de
16:59 - bug and how it debugs yeah yeah let's
17:03 - see okay so it's debugging ouch and in
17:07 - the meantime I want to be seeing Oh my
17:12 - God all right can it convert this very
17:15 - boring financial report into an oh so we
17:18 - will'll be able to look at our taxes in
17:20 - a fun way yeah I'll be like hey make my
17:22 - taxes look
17:25 - fun make it Mak it into a game okay
17:28 - let's see simulation oh see I [ __ ]
17:31 - knew it dude it's not
17:34 - oh oh what the [ __ ] yeah with more
17:38 - wind yeah bro still the heav I'm telling
17:40 - you no but actually kind of the same
17:43 - ball drops ball and the Anvil is the
17:46 - same dude Anvil drops just a little bit
17:48 - first I think yeah I could be wrong but
17:52 - we could slowmo but I I'm pretty sure
17:54 - Anvil's dropping first uhuh I don't know
17:57 - yeah Anvil drops first it's the same and
17:59 - then the ball drops reduce the wind
18:01 - speed reduce the wind speed to reduce
18:03 - the wind speed well wind speed reduce
18:06 - everything's going to fall at the same
18:07 - time I think
18:10 - no yeah animal drops like 0.1 MC
18:17 - earlier huh yeah yeah um interesting I
18:21 - could be wrong but we could watch it in
18:23 - slow-mo afterwards may you guys can
18:24 - watch in slow-mo and tell us um but yeah
18:28 - this is active
18:30 - infographic oh my god wow that looks so
18:34 - good can it create an audio visualizer
18:37 - that would syn with any so okay so it
18:41 - that works and then apparently you can
18:43 - have it make UI that looks really good
18:47 - too so let's actually find UI so I'll
18:49 - just say hey build this
18:52 - UI so I'll go here and I'll
18:55 - say uh build this with react in tell and
18:58 - CSS
18:59 - with the
19:01 - Tailwind CSS and let's just see what it
19:04 - does God this is exciting because then
19:09 - um front end will just go so next level
19:11 - like versel zero won't even come close
19:13 - dude versel is not close even to this at
19:14 - all v0 thing this will even be better
19:17 - than v0 you want to show them v0 by the
19:19 - way while it's loading just so they know
19:21 - um yeah I think just to give them
19:22 - contest I feel like a l might Dev so
19:25 - this is the versel one and this is where
19:27 - you can kind of add in like something
19:29 - with AI and then it'll build it out for
19:31 - you yeah um kind of like this just still
19:35 - not bad it's just not good dude that is
19:39 - really good
19:40 - dude that is really good and keep in
19:43 - mind it's like not using any libraries
19:46 - and anything like that it's like writing
19:47 - it with Tailwind you know but like but
19:50 - how does it have a tailin CS but how
19:51 - does it have Tailwind CSS library though
19:54 - um you think some already pre-built
20:00 - actually right good question
20:03 - right yeah look yeah it it has access to
20:06 - Tailwind they've given it access to
20:07 - Tailwind or something maybe themselves
20:09 - yeah I don't know that's crazy huh that
20:11 - is crazy I bet they're even built on
20:14 - Tailwind
20:16 - no or you don't think so I don't know oh
20:21 - wow their page you can't read it at all
20:23 - no it's ass their page you cannot read
20:25 - it at all h
20:28 - what is that oh this it just runs
20:30 - horizontally dude my God I think it is T
20:33 - CSS though I saw
20:35 - it um but it looks overall pretty damn
20:38 - good especially if you imagine images
20:41 - here these buttons to be more like
20:44 - inside of it wow and they even got the
20:46 - text 30 years of sales it got the text
20:49 - correctly it got the names of the people
20:52 - correctly the channels it didn't get the
20:54 - images but it got everything else
20:55 - correctly yeah I want to see if I can
20:58 - get give it an IM what if do you think I
21:01 - can give it an image and it could pop
21:02 - that in there like if I gave it an image
21:04 - myself yes interesting okay so let's try
21:07 - that so let's take uh like right click
21:10 - an image and image from our
21:12 - computer and see if we can give it that
21:14 - so I'll just say oh actually the could
21:16 - be that so I'm giving it this image
21:18 - right here that we had made and let's
21:23 - say use this oh wow that's funny image
21:26 - and pop oh wow it's even better now as
21:32 - uh okay let's I don't know if it could
21:35 - do that cuz it would have to host it but
21:37 - I guess it's already hosting I'm
21:39 - confused I mean it is hosting it
21:41 - somewhere yeah but let's see if it
21:43 - allows but it if it allows its own thing
21:46 - to serve it as to actually serve it I
21:48 - agree that would be really cool
21:51 - yeah it's like slow down a little bit it
21:53 - feels like to me no no
21:56 - placeholder no it's not using this let's
21:59 - see but um we can give it a linki
22:04 - image thumbnail yeah I think I mean if
22:06 - we gave it for sure I think if we gave
22:08 - it something like
22:10 - this uh it would pull that like put that
22:13 - in there uh use this
22:18 - image oh wait hold on this is not a
22:20 - normal image yeah go to like a link
22:23 - let's go to
22:26 - this how can we get a
22:29 - normal maybe just go to MGR and find
22:32 - something oh nice yeah great place for
22:37 - [Music]
22:39 - YouTube we don't have to so let's
22:42 - actually find this image I'll grab the
22:44 - direct link of this so if I open it it
22:45 - should open there beautiful so let's
22:47 - actually go use this image there we go
22:51 - so I mean that I think should work um
22:55 - because it's a link yeah I think it
22:56 - should work wow this is so cool I love
23:00 - like coding in here it's so much fun
23:02 - right I don't yeah because the only
23:04 - reason I even code on my computer yeah
23:06 - is just so I can paste the code that I
23:08 - got from Claude I've never dude it's
23:10 - been so long since I've written a
23:12 - [ __ ] single line of code so that's
23:15 - the only reason I code on my own
23:16 - computer is so I could paste this thing
23:18 - did it
23:19 - work no no [ __ ] really why that was a
23:23 - direct image so that should have
23:26 - worked I no actually it's not them CU
23:29 - it's still image you are n this is like
23:32 - a direct image is not working so sad
23:35 - okay I'll try one last time but then we
23:37 - should just move on but still really
23:39 - freaking cool that it does all this if I
23:41 - look at the code is it popping it in
23:43 - anywhere yes it is like like imagine
23:46 - that for developers who are right oh it
23:50 - could be like due to
23:51 - image Network issue like restrictions or
23:54 - image hosting restrictions or something
23:55 - on their back cor's issues yeah [ __ ]
23:58 - hate cor's issues yeah all the damn time
24:01 - it's always issues wonder I wonder if it
24:04 - can hit API requests I don't think
24:09 - so like uh placey
24:12 - holder oh like dice
24:15 - API like can it hit a API
24:19 - so uh oh what happened
24:25 - here
24:27 - cool okay so let's see if it could
24:33 - hit um make a UI where when I press a
24:38 - button it
24:40 - hits this API and gets
24:45 - me so let's see so like what does it get
24:48 - by the way gets a bunch of stuff
24:50 - including title so it just gets me back
24:52 - like and then spits back the Json and I
24:55 - think it to tell it what the response is
24:58 - on that's okay it just spits back the
25:01 - response that's fine so let's see if it
25:04 - could do that because that would be
25:05 - really cool if it can hit apis yeah then
25:08 - that gives us access that opens up a lot
25:10 - of what we can do actually that is
25:14 - true I am very excited to see if I could
25:18 - do that okay interesting fetch post
25:21 - users and comments knows about this so
25:23 - good so let's
25:26 - see nice no failed okay let's look at
25:29 - the code pi and then the and you see
25:33 - this the end point uh don't make it
25:37 - Dynamic for the end
25:40 - point
25:43 - um for the end point it's so hot in this
25:48 - house for the end point you can
25:52 - just use to do like
25:56 - this okay so let's see if it does
26:06 - that okay so let's see if this is going
26:08 - to
26:11 - work um
26:16 - no let's see the code like look for any
26:19 - place I don't see any placeholder so
26:21 - this should potentially work no I don't
26:23 - know why I'll look into this but this
26:26 - would be really cool if API yeah work
26:29 - yeah I don't know if they work
26:33 - maybe so a jump right in so I can what
26:36 - cool and so yeah that's very interesting
26:39 - so on benchmarks it seems like it
26:42 - beats uh
26:44 - Claude three and
26:46 - GP gradual level reasoning this is zero
26:50 - shot Chain of Thought and so it will
26:53 - outperform gp4 and uh Opus 2o I mean I
26:57 - thought opus was better than gp4 in most
27:00 - categories but um yeah that's kind of
27:03 - surprising for me so just so you guys
27:05 - know what zero shot means can you zo me
27:07 - on me for a second can you just so you
27:10 - guys know what zero shot means because I
27:12 - did not know this myself zero shot means
27:14 - zero examples so like one shot is one
27:16 - example two shot is like two examples so
27:19 - zero shot means like they give you no
27:20 - examples of like here's what the result
27:22 - should be or it could look like and the
27:25 - AI has to figure it out by itself and be
27:26 - creative uh as possible by itself and
27:29 - this something I learned from you
27:30 - actually yeah um so yeah so it's got
27:33 - zero shot so and then undergraduate
27:36 - level knowledge apparently Claude is
27:40 - just as good as gp4 interesting code it
27:45 - beats Claude and gp4 yeah multilingual
27:50 - math um okay I don't know that don't
27:53 - even know what that is um reasoning over
27:56 - text so claw I mean dude this is such
27:59 - [ __ ] like claude's reasoning was
28:01 - always superior I don't know what the
28:03 - [ __ ] these things are but like Claude
28:05 - always just destroyed in my opinion GPT
28:07 - 4 yeah um so I'm not I don't agree with
28:11 - any of these like for claws I don't
28:13 - agree with any of this but this compared
28:16 - to the others I guess makes sense I have
28:18 - to use Sonic more I'm really curious
28:20 - actually how they test these
28:21 - things yeah I don't know like is there
28:24 - like a standardized test like a [ __ ]
28:25 - act or sat is is it like is it is a
28:29 - result given by multiple humans because
28:31 - if it's given by multiple humans um then
28:34 - multiple humans what they take into
28:35 - account is um how fast something
28:38 - responds so one of the reasons I saw GPT
28:41 - 4 was scoring high on a lot of things is
28:44 - simply because even if it was a little
28:46 - inaccurate it was so much faster that
28:48 - the satisfaction rate of humans who were
28:50 - using it was way higher so it had
28:52 - actually a higher they give uh these
28:53 - Bots ELO ratings there's actually a
28:55 - website MH um
28:59 - um llm
29:02 - leaderboard uh ELO there's a website for
29:05 - this yeah CIS llm CIS and inside of this
29:09 - they have ratings like literally like a
29:11 - chess rating for each of the Bots and so
29:14 - in here you can see at any given time
29:16 - like which bot the people have voted and
29:19 - how good it is so here you can see gp4
29:23 - has an arena score of 1287 mhm Sonet is
29:26 - 1271 so a lot of the people on this
29:29 - platform 18,000 votes to 51,000 votes so
29:33 - out of those votes they basically said
29:35 - that they're more satisfied with gp4
29:37 - than Sonic so GPT 40 is still better in
29:39 - that aspect but also GPT 40 does have
29:42 - more votes so what does that mean um
29:46 - that usually means that that's harder to
29:48 - rate higher if you have because it's
29:50 - easier to have a higher rating with less
29:52 - votes so it actually has more votes so
29:55 - people are more overall satisfied with
29:57 - gp4 so it means like a lot of people are
29:59 - still using it pretty heavily um and
30:02 - keep in mind a lot of apis still use it
30:05 - a lot um and so Sonet yeah I still have
30:10 - to use it more but a couple of other
30:12 - interesting things so sonnet's cut off
30:14 - actually is um March April April oh
30:18 - that's pretty good actually year so they
30:20 - might even know about things like
30:21 - versals AISD K and stuff like that ask
30:24 - it let's ask it actually um okay so you
30:28 - use versel as DC to make um a chat route
30:34 - for a chat for a dummy chat between end
30:39 - point gp4 use gp4 o uh what GPT four
30:45 - four Okay cool so let's see if it can do
30:48 - that so this if it does that that means
30:50 - it's it's true that it's cut off is
30:52 - pretty
30:53 - high um
30:56 - actually uh
30:58 - oh wait no it does dude AI use chat
31:01 - react from use chat AI react it's not
31:04 - going to be working that is beautiful
31:06 - huh but then look messes content that's
31:10 - exactly it dude that's yes that's good
31:14 - [ __ ] knows it it knows it whereas I
31:16 - think GPT struggles with that wow that's
31:20 - insane um fantastic amazing so where
31:23 - were we yeah so this is a platform you
31:27 - can go and check things out so let's go
31:29 - back to the video um and in the video
31:32 - yeah so I don't know how this testing is
31:34 - done if it's with people or if it's
31:36 - would like machines score it mhm and
31:39 - then yeah then I don't know some other
31:42 - scores but son is apparently better in
31:44 - everything you can do with it and also
31:45 - test out it in the description to
31:47 - generate presentations and designs and
31:51 - there you go artifact tables and code
31:53 - prompt none of so he basically creates a
31:55 - snake game that's a very interesting
31:58 - oh that's sick that's sick I like that
32:00 - why is he running it on his own computer
32:03 - I know oh no he probably has it oh no he
32:06 - probably took the code oh audio
32:09 - visualizer that is so cool actually yes
32:13 - that's a sick idea I want to try that
32:15 - one so audio
32:17 - visualizer um I think he's he makes that
32:20 - he makes that in so he actually was even
32:23 - using this exact image so let's try that
32:27 - and I'll take take this and we'll put
32:29 - that in here and we'll go here and we'll
32:32 - go like this and we'll say make an audio
32:35 - visualiz visualizer like
32:38 - this uh and play some sounds too so
32:41 - let's see
32:43 - if that
32:45 - works but that is really freaking cool
32:48 - yeah we might not be able to actually do
32:51 - it on
32:52 - here because we we need an audio to
32:54 - actually no I know but I'm saying that
32:56 - for sounds if it just does the yeah gain
32:59 - oscillator thing ah
33:02 - okay try to use builtin sounds with like
33:07 - the gain SL oscillator because you don't
33:11 - have
33:12 - access
33:14 - libraries hit
33:17 - play yeah there's nothing to play yeah
33:20 - and it's not doing that image either yet
33:24 - the way would you would be able to do it
33:26 - is we have to take this code into actual
33:28 - react application and then I'm sure
33:29 - we'll be able to make it happen for sure
33:31 - but here I'm saying don't use any
33:33 - Library so I think this I feel like
33:35 - might be more promising
33:38 - try
33:39 - whoa that's SI though look at that so
33:42 - and then you can change the
33:44 - frequency and it actually visually
33:46 - changes with the
33:51 - frequency look at
33:53 - that that sounds like a plane dude whoa
33:57 - and so when I move it watch how it
34:01 - moves you can visualize the
34:04 - frequency that's so sick oh my God I
34:07 - love this dude so yeah that is amazing
34:10 - so it's like already working as a react
34:12 - component yeah and then if we bring that
34:14 - in and we change it with actual music
34:16 - inside of vs code that would work well
34:19 - work yes I'm going to take a screenshot
34:21 - of that just make coding so much easier
34:24 - like imagine if a developer gets a
34:26 - design from figma mhm from a designer
34:29 - and he's like just takes a screenshot or
34:31 - he just [ __ ] exports as a screenshot
34:33 - and boom drops in into clot on it gets
34:36 - the code creates a component in his app
34:39 - boom it's there like so cool the
34:41 - component would be working already right
34:43 - right there just from the design and
34:45 - then you're like hey look it works and
34:46 - then I imagine like for example the
34:48 - cursor e IDE imagine that is able to
34:51 - actually is integrated with that too
34:54 - then it just fully creates it for you in
34:55 - cursor ID yeah yeah I mean eventually
34:58 - you're right you you'll get access to
34:59 - Sonet and within the cursor ID you'll
35:02 - even be able to play the component
35:04 - inside of the UI that's sick the inside
35:06 - of the chat UI that would be so
35:09 - sick
35:11 - interesting okay any other things that
35:13 - are interesting here so the sensitivity
35:16 - I'm going
35:18 - to wait what the [ __ ] oh what the hey
35:21 - how does oh choose file dude that's what
35:25 - we should do that is sick
35:28 - dude let's add that in so let's add a
35:30 - choose file to add an ability to choose
35:34 - file that is so cool oh then we can get
35:37 - a let's get a sound from like EP
35:39 - epidemic sound or like a copyright free
35:42 - song yeah I'll try to find
35:48 - um do you have a song I probably have
35:50 - something with
35:52 - MP3 in my Mac Wow
35:57 - name contains
36:00 - [Music]
36:04 - MP3
36:06 - no
36:09 - no definitely
36:12 - no the hell is that
36:19 - no nope about to get
36:22 - banned
36:23 - completely oh what about our own song
36:26 - The do you have our own song that we
36:28 - made
36:29 - inside the JavaScript and react [ __ ]
36:33 - the yeah road map yeah the road map song
36:38 - uh let's see if I have it on the
36:41 - computer like I should but I might
36:47 - not
36:49 - 2024 let's see file choose
36:54 - file oh MP4 the hell
36:58 - let's see if we can do a oh there's an
37:01 - MP3 right there dude oh hell
37:06 - yeah yeah dude now hit play it says
37:09 - right
37:12 - there ah oh nothing damn damn it's not
37:15 - playing the song can you make it work
37:18 - with an MP3 file dude this will be so
37:22 - interesting if it does and then it
37:24 - should just play that mp35
37:28 - audio okay let's give it a try fingers
37:30 - crossed that's cool I'm so I'm so
37:32 - curious
37:34 - actually like I love this kind of stuff
37:37 - it's just so quick and yeah good yeah
37:42 - state is
37:45 - supended that was a genius idea yeah
37:47 - local files yeah you could do local
37:49 - files I totally didn't think about that
37:51 - I could build so many local apps like
37:53 - that and the UI is so [ __ ] good it's
37:56 - aan UI yeah look even the play button is
37:59 - not work until you actually probably get
38:00 - an MP3 you know yeah a road map you
38:03 - searched road map
38:05 - before uhhuh and then that
38:08 - one yeah okay
38:11 - H oh
38:13 - no come
38:15 - on
38:17 - interesting I how the
38:20 - heck okay I'll I'll keep sitting here
38:23 - and debugging it for eternity but let's
38:25 - go through with the video
38:28 - how he did it and this is
38:30 - really ah he did customizable audio uh
38:34 - visualizer HTML page so turn this into a
38:39 - basic HTML page with an
38:42 - audio visualizer for local MP3 files wo
38:47 - look at that beautiful clean wow
38:51 - professional prompter right here super
38:53 - professional prompter so I think maybe
38:56 - with vanilla HTML it might work
39:00 - better yeah um hopefully let's
39:05 - see that's the only difference that I
39:08 - saw that that yeah gentleman did a I
39:11 - search okay let's try yeah the uglier
39:14 - the better preferably
39:17 - yeah when it's ugly you know it'll
39:21 - work come on broken broken now okay all
39:25 - right let's keep going with the video so
39:27 - audio visualizer is a fantastic idea
39:29 - copying a website design is good idea
39:31 - Tetris yes I was really surprised that
39:34 - the dude was able to make a Shooter 3D
39:37 - that is crazy dude that I did not know
39:39 - so um make a 3D racing game racing game
39:45 - yes please oh yes please 3D or 2D 3D
39:50 - okay let's see dude that'd be so cool
39:53 - I'm so I love racing games holy [ __ ] you
39:55 - guys have no idea okay let's give it a
39:56 - try we should get a racing game on our
39:59 - Xbox oh yes please that would be a lot
40:02 - of fun I will [ __ ] on you hell yeah
40:05 - let's go bro I'm
40:09 - excited um okay let's
40:13 - see oh dude that's exciting oh what the
40:19 - hell oh is it going wait it works
40:22 - actually is it actually use erors to
40:24 - control the car
40:29 - it's [ __ ] working dude and look it
40:31 - gets faster and faster it like
40:33 - accelerates and you like
40:36 - turn what if I fall off
40:40 - oh drifting here try damn let
40:44 - see hold up oh oh wait wait wait wait
40:49 - wait wait can I go at the same time wait
40:51 - wait wait come on the car starts getting
40:54 - faster oh oh oh oh look
40:58 - cuz I have to yeah but then it doesn't
41:01 - go fast yeah you have to like hold it's
41:03 - like a balance you got to like you got
41:05 - to like get the right angle and then
41:07 - just see go as far as you can oh that's
41:09 - lit and then you got to get make it a
41:11 - straight line just be like make it into
41:12 - a straight line please like straight
41:14 - line with ob make the track a straight
41:19 - line dude this is so cool this is the
41:21 - first time I'll actually start making
41:23 - games that is so fun and uh if we made
41:27 - 2D we could make it like two player as
41:29 - well oh that would be awesome I like
41:32 - those tapping games where we you see who
41:34 - can tap faster oh yes and we play two
41:37 - players and we play that against each
41:38 - other we we can actually make that game
41:39 - on here dude [ __ ] make a t game and
41:41 - then
41:43 - [ __ ] yeah okay let's see what happens
41:46 - here okay oh that's cool okay all right
41:50 - you want to take off let's go let's see
41:52 - how fast you can
41:53 - go oh how do I know how fast I'm going
41:56 - uh you're making progress for
42:01 - sure um will the track ever end yeah it
42:05 - does right there see I'm I'm I'm almost
42:07 - at the end oh oh oh look look look dude
42:10 - maybe the Earth is flat
42:13 - too maybe the Earth is like this the
42:15 - Earth is flat you eventually just get
42:17 - whoever told you the Earth is round does
42:19 - not know what they're talking about
42:20 - maybe you eventually get to a part like
42:22 - this look I can turn look oh uturn
42:25 - u-turns five five point turn
42:28 - wow dude amazing okay this is absolutely
42:31 - awesome imagine if you keep garbage so
42:35 - slide two slide three how cool that is
42:39 - very nice infographic report yeah we
42:43 - talked about that yeah oh yeah turning
42:45 - your reports into interact oh this is
42:47 - beautiful like your taxes like taxes or
42:49 - like sales like if we have a uh sales
42:53 - revenue and then we want to look at like
42:54 - last week how many sales we made for our
42:56 - SAS products yeah we can look at that
42:59 - that'd be cool um taxes for sure uh okay
43:05 - ooh nice so building a neural network
43:08 - animation so for for I feel like for
43:11 - animations it's so good because you can
43:13 - visualize so many things right within
43:14 - here and because for for a lot of
43:16 - animations you don't need a lot of
43:17 - libraries you can just use a normal
43:18 - JavaScript stuff and like CSS you know
43:21 - yes so that's why that's also really
43:22 - good it's so good cuz it could just
43:23 - build it with regular Basics uh HTML and
43:26 - all that yeah um so okay so cost is on
43:32 - the right Axis bro so Sonet is way
43:34 - cheaper so way higher intelligence and
43:37 - way cheaper oh really yeah you see
43:40 - where's I mean it's on it's still not
43:42 - cheaper than gp40 gp40 is the cheapest I
43:44 - didn't say gp4 I said Claud yeah yeah I
43:47 - know I know I'm saying in my head I'm
43:49 - like cuz in my head I was right away
43:51 - comparing it to GPT 40 and I was like
43:53 - damn I wish it was even more cheaper
43:55 - than gp40 sure yeah of course that would
43:58 - be amazing uh but yeah it's way better
44:01 - than gp4 so it makes sense to me for it
44:03 - to be more expensive yeah but like I'm
44:05 - really happy that it's way cheaper than
44:08 - Opus like it's almost in the middle
44:10 - between Haiku and
44:12 - Opus cuz yeah our cost if we switch to
44:15 - Opus we won't get destroyed yeah how we
44:17 - were going to get destroyed earlier yeah
44:20 - so yeah overall this is absolutely
44:24 - amazing and then what is this specs of
44:26 - claw
44:29 - what did you say I'm saying what a model
44:31 - what a beautiful model this is a
44:34 - gorgeous model so um that was awesome to
44:38 - take a look at and that brings us to our
44:41 - sponsor for the video hey ourselves yes
44:45 - so if you want to actually use a visual
44:47 - version haha if you want to use a visual
44:50 - version of Chad
44:51 - GPT um kind of like using Claude but
44:56 - more visually speaking uh you can do
44:59 - that and you can even for example take
45:00 - this AI search video copy the link paste
45:04 - it in here you can grab that video open
45:07 - up this chat bad boy connect it and just
45:10 - go uh key takeaways from this video and
45:15 - check this out oh it actually gives you
45:18 - them right away yeah uh what
45:22 - comparisons does he use mhm and it show
45:27 - you uh what comparisons he use what
45:30 - games does he
45:33 - make and he'll tell you that that he
45:35 - makes a snake game a Tetris game and a
45:37 - 3D first person shooter amazing um and
45:41 - yeah that Claude takeaways right Sonet
45:44 - 3.5 is a powerful AI model mhm
45:48 - versatility can create games
45:49 - visualizations presentations and more
45:52 - outperforms previous models and there's
45:54 - a free access with higher limits yeah
45:57 - but the powerful thing here is that it's
45:58 - not just about talking to one YouTube
46:00 - video it's about actually talking to
46:02 - either multiple YouTube videos or
46:04 - multiple sources so you can have
46:06 - multiple YouTube videos on a specific
46:07 - topic that you're trying to learn so
46:09 - maybe you're trying to learn coding
46:11 - maybe you're trying to learn how to use
46:13 - for example a specific LM model in this
46:16 - video let's say for example you want to
46:18 - take multiple people's video because you
46:19 - don't want to trust just one source of
46:21 - getting your information on Claud versus
46:23 - GPT so you can actually combine both of
46:26 - these videos
46:27 - and you can go based
46:30 - on uh let's actually let's create a new
46:33 - chat let's just go based on both of
46:37 - these videos what are all key yeah what
46:41 - are the benefits M of Sonet CLA 3.5
46:47 - versus GPT 40 and that's it and let's
46:50 - just see
46:52 - yeah so apparently coding
46:54 - proficiency it operates faster than four
46:58 - I did not know that more cost effective
47:01 - for complex T tasks yeah artifacts
47:04 - feature which was a amazing feature that
47:06 - we saw a great feature yes shitty name
47:08 - I'll be honest yeah it does not Mak any
47:10 - sense I agree like what what yeah I mean
47:13 - I can't think of a better name at the
47:14 - top of my head but definitely should
47:15 - have a better name yeah higher
47:17 - benchmarks in everything yep interactive
47:20 - visualizations data analysis so like now
47:23 - you're getting the information from two
47:24 - of these videos now what if there was um
47:27 - so gp4 o versus Sonet uh Sonet right
47:33 - yeah now let's see what if we have
47:38 - um something like oh I don't know if you
47:40 - want to use right this or let's say we
47:42 - have an article hacker noon article sure
47:46 - great okay so we take this hacker noon
47:48 - article and Weck news oh oh hacker noon

47:51 - reason yeah so let's say we take that
47:53 - hacker noon article I'm going to click
47:55 - this website paste it in here here pop
47:57 - that bad boy in and now we'll give it a
47:59 - couple of seconds okay here we go so it
48:02 - not only read through the article but it
48:05 - also changed the title of it at the top
48:07 - so you can actually see that uh and I'll
48:10 - pop that in here and uh let's just say
48:13 - let's ask it like I'm going to create a
48:14 - new chat and I'm just going to ask it
48:16 - like what does
48:18 - the uh article on
48:22 - Claude gp4 un haacker noon say
48:27 - okay and so let's take a look at
48:30 - that y so it says these are the key
48:33 - things 2x speed so let's go here does it
