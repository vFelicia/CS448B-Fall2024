00:05 - hey guys how's it going this is konzi
00:08 - from clever programmer comm we did the
00:10 - challenge of switch case the switch case
00:13 - challenge challenge last time and before
00:15 - that we did the lower case in the upper
00:17 - case so now let's move on to the next
00:19 - challenge this one has a little bit of a
00:20 - crazy name it's called aardvark zebra
00:24 - index challenge so let's jump right into
00:27 - it and check it out what's going on and
00:28 - one fun fact while I was recording this
00:31 - video got deleted so we're doing it
00:32 - again but this gives us a chance to do
00:35 - it a little bit better alright so let's
00:37 - jump right into it
00:40 - so basically what they're saying is like
00:42 - hey look strings or just like lists in
00:45 - Python so if I gave you a list of like
00:47 - apple banana you could index I'd buy
00:50 - that list by zero and get back Apple
00:53 - just like a string you can do the same
00:55 - thing if I gave you a string hello and
00:57 - if you index it by 0 you get the zeroth
01:00 - character which is H if you index it by
01:02 - 1 you get e if your index it by 2 you
01:05 - get L so on and so forth alright so
01:09 - using that knowledge what we're going to
01:11 - do is we're going to code up the
01:12 - solution this problem now some of you
01:14 - saw the solution was already there
01:16 - because of the previous video but not to
01:18 - worry I just removed it what I want you
01:22 - to do is actively try to do this
01:24 - challenge so if you're on my website and
01:25 - you're going through this blog post it's
01:29 - going to end clever programmer calm and
01:31 - it's also in the link description below
01:33 - you could do this challenge right below
01:35 - the video and you don't even have to
01:36 - open up Python on your computer but if
01:41 - you are doing it on your computer that's
01:42 - totally fine let's jump through this
01:44 - thing and let's see how we get this done
01:46 - so the problem basically says if you're
01:48 - given a string and if it starts with a
01:50 - the letter A then it should say aardvark
01:53 - and if I give you anything that doesn't
01:55 - start with an A you should throw me back
01:57 - zebra so if I gave you argh you should
02:00 - tell me
02:01 - hey aardvark and if I gave you back
02:04 - something that said something like
02:05 - shrink it you should say zebra alright
02:09 - so we have this function and it's called
02:12 - aardvark how will
02:13 - we make that work so we'll use a simple
02:15 - if statement give it a try actively
02:18 - engaged and learning this process guys
02:20 - so try this coding challenge right below
02:22 - this video if you're on my website if
02:25 - string of zero right the first character
02:29 - of the string and in Python zero means
02:32 - first okay in human language basically
02:34 - if string of zero is an a then what I
02:39 - want you to do is return aardvark
02:44 - alright otherwise I want you to return
02:47 - zebra okay now when I run it you can see
02:53 - that given argh right here it gave us
02:55 - back aardvark which matches our result
02:58 - on line five and give and shrink it it
03:00 - gave us back zebra which matches our
03:02 - results from line six in line seven
03:04 - right line six is showing you what if
03:06 - you wrote aardvark trinket like this it
03:09 - should give you back zebra so our
03:11 - results are matching the test cases that
03:13 - they gave us that's it for this
03:15 - challenge it was really simple thank you
03:18 - guys for watching as always I love you
03:20 - guys so much and I'll see you in the
03:23 - next video
