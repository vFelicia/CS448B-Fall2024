00:00 - - Hey guys, what's up?
00:01 - This is Qazi from cleverprogrammer.com
00:03 - and in this video, we're
gonna answer the question of,
00:06 - is computer programming hard to learn.
00:09 - So let's jump right into it.
00:12 - (upbeat music)
00:17 - OK so I get this question a lot.
00:19 - Is computer programming hard to learn?
00:21 - Well I would kind of flip it back onto you
00:23 - and say hey, tell me one thing
that you think is worth doing
00:27 - that can actually make you money,
00:29 - that can actually make you happy,
00:30 - that can satisfy you,
that's not hard right?
00:33 - So if you go back in your life,
search your memory vaults,
00:37 - you will find that almost
everything that's worthwhile
00:40 - is actually hard right?
00:42 - So with computer programming,
it's no different.
00:45 - I'm not gonna lie to you and
say that it's somehow like,
00:48 - you'll learn it instantly.
00:49 - But here are a few
things I will say to you.
00:52 - It's not harder than any
other field that you want
00:55 - to get good at first of all.
00:57 - Another thing I wanna add is,
00:59 - I wanna kind of jump
right into busting myths.
01:03 - Some of the most handicapping myths
01:06 - that will stop your from
actually getting good
01:08 - at computer programming are, number one,
01:14 - do I need to be a math genius
01:16 - to actually get good at
computer programming?
01:18 - And I'm gonna bust this one right away.
01:22 - The answer is no.
01:24 - You do not need to be
some kind of math genius
01:27 - to get good at computer
programming alright.
01:31 - Programming does not require any kind of,
01:35 - like you don't need to know
differential equations,
01:37 - you don't need to have
taken some calculus.
01:40 - There are people who have
written all that code for you,
01:42 - that you can actually kind
of just use for yourself
01:46 - and make your life a lot easier.
01:49 - Let's cut that one out
right away because it stops
01:52 - 90% of the people from
pursuing this field.
01:56 - Probably the number one growing
01:57 - field right now in the world.
02:01 - As people, we work actually
harder to find excuses to not
02:06 - do something rather than to
find excuses to do something.
02:11 - And this particular one,
being a math genius,
02:15 - or a math wizard, happens
to be one of those ones.
02:18 - Myth number two, is it too late for me
02:22 - to start learning computer programming?
02:25 - Is it too late?
02:27 - It wasn't too late for
Jeff Bezos to start Amazon.
02:31 - It wasn't too late for William Boeing
02:35 - and it certainly wasn't
too late for Hugo Boss.
02:38 - This is another one of those myths
02:40 - that people use to kind of stop themselves
02:42 - from achieving their dreams,
achieving their goals
02:46 - and avoiding their fear of failure.
02:50 - The quick answer to that
is, no, it's not too late
02:53 - to learn computer programming.
02:55 - From my experience, I
have taught students,
03:01 - who are age seven who learned
and also of age 65 and older
03:06 - who have actually learned.
03:08 - And that's just from me right,
03:09 - the people that I worked with.
03:11 - Now you reach out to
thousands of other people,
03:14 - who are learning online
in today's day and age.
03:18 - And thousands of them
are actually a lot older
03:21 - and they've started and
they've become great
03:23 - at computer programming.
03:26 - There are not like two different
companies you can work at.
03:30 - There's not just Dropbox and Google.
03:33 - There are many other companies,
and independent contractor
03:35 - work that you can do as
a software developer.
03:37 - So if you develop a certain skill,
03:39 - let's say it's creating
apps, creating web apps.
03:43 - If it's helping solve somebody's problem,
03:45 - there's somebody that you
can actually work with
03:48 - and charge.
03:50 - So that's how I would
answer that question.
03:52 - It's not too late for
you to start learning
03:55 - computer programming.
03:57 - I have a few videos that talk about
03:59 - what programming language
you can start off with first,
04:02 - that can help you kind of decide,
04:04 - OK where do you kind of start?
04:07 - I have a video that will show
you what kind of resources
04:10 - you can use to help you
learn computer programming
04:13 - so you can learn it faster.
04:16 - Go ahead and watch those
if you're interested
04:19 - in pursuing this.
04:21 - But those were some of the
most handicapping myths
04:24 - that I could think of that I
wanted to kind of tell you,
04:28 - don't fall for them.
04:30 - Don't let your excuses
drive your behavior.
04:35 - Don't let your fear of failure stop you
04:38 - from achieving your goals.
04:41 - Computer programming is an awesome field.
04:43 - And I think in today's day and age,
04:45 - everybody should be doing it.
04:46 - And no matter what field you're in,
04:48 - you can actually use it to help you.
04:51 - That's one of the things I cover
04:52 - in why you should learn
to code video as well.
04:56 - That's it guys for me.
04:58 - This is Qazi, I'm signing out.
05:00 - I love every single one of you.
05:02 - And I'll see you in the next video.
