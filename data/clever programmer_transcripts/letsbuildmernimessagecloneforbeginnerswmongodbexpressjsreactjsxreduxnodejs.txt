04:26 - we are going to start in just a couple
04:28 - of minutes i just want to
04:30 - uh get everyone back on this live
04:34 - uh so that we can continue and i think
04:38 - okay let's just sum it up where we left
04:41 - off so we were at this point where
04:44 - this application should have started
04:48 - working
04:49 - but then my internet dropped so what i
04:52 - will be doing
04:53 - is pretty much create a new chat and say
04:56 - the name
04:56 - is going to be uh epic cp
05:00 - community and i will add the
05:05 - are you using stream yes i am is this a
05:07 - new live
05:08 - ask asks clarity no it's actually the
05:11 - same one
05:12 - uh just my internet dropped and so i had
05:15 - to uh
05:16 - start it all over again raza says let's
05:19 - start bro it's 2 am here yeah i'm trying
05:21 - to wrap it up in
05:22 - 15 minutes there is probably not more
05:25 - than that left
05:26 - so what i will be doing is just add the
05:29 - welcome message and say
05:30 - welcome back guys
05:34 - and add a bit of a fire emoji
05:39 - and yeah nothing happens because it's
05:41 - not real time yet but i'm going to
05:43 - refresh
05:44 - and whoa we got two of these stuff going
05:47 - on
05:48 - uh so let's actually test this one okay
05:52 - so for some reason
05:53 - this doesn't work let's add the back
05:56 - effect and what we will be doing is
06:01 - going ahead and pretty much uh
06:04 - fix this bug now uh
06:08 - because it is actually having problems
06:11 - in the message.js file
06:13 - i will be going in there so message.js
06:17 - has some kind of issues going on and
06:21 - let's actually address those so
06:24 - message.js actually receives only
06:28 - four of the four uh pro
06:31 - four props and those are
06:34 - being the following so we are we are
06:37 - actually tr we
06:38 - actually changed a tiny bit of the
06:41 - uh structure that we were uh building we
06:44 - are 82 strong guys
06:45 - as you are coming in uh let's carry on
06:49 - we are continuing where we left off my
06:52 - internet dropped for a
06:53 - second so i had to restart earlier start
06:55 - the whole stream
06:57 - um so yeah let's actually continue
07:02 - and what i will be doing is pretty much
07:05 - just
07:05 - add a new uh
07:08 - new way how we uh handle all the
07:12 - dates and this is this would be it uh
07:16 - actually i'm gonna uh add the old one uh
07:19 - up above so we are actually
07:23 - why you implement channel uh and message
07:26 - deletion
07:27 - will you implement uh not today this is
07:30 - already a long build but we will
07:31 - definitely do
07:32 - a crowd functionality and all that stuff
07:34 - that will be a bit longer build
07:37 - uh yeah finish it in style yes i'll do
07:40 - okay so sunny built
07:44 - it uh sunny did a bit of a differently
07:47 - uh with some time ago stuff and all that
07:50 - we are not going to use that
07:51 - instead we are going to be parsing it as
07:54 - a
07:55 - an integer and we will be uh
07:58 - making this a date string
08:01 - now we also changed the way
08:06 - how we uh uh
08:11 - add the email as well so we will be
08:14 - saying oops we will be saying
08:17 - sender.email because we are passing in
08:19 - sender here right
08:21 - so we are actually testing
08:24 - uh we are actually testing against the
08:27 - sender.email
08:28 - the current user and that's how we will
08:31 - decide if it goes to the right and if
08:33 - it's going to be blue
08:34 - or if it is going to be uh uh
08:37 - if it is going to be on the left and
08:39 - it's going to be
08:40 - gray
08:44 - okay nice we are actually getting back
08:46 - we are almost at 100 people
08:48 - thank you so much for coming back guys i
08:50 - really appreciate everybody
08:52 - and let's actually uh
08:56 - check out how we will handle the photo
08:59 - questions because
09:00 - we are handling that differently as well
09:02 - because we are passing in
09:04 - this sender right guys and we are
09:07 - we will need to uh
09:10 - import that thing and we will also
09:14 - add the message which hasn't really
09:17 - changed so with that let's test
09:21 - let's test it out if it is working this
09:24 - way
09:24 - now this is still bugging out for some
09:27 - reason
09:28 - and now it says
09:31 - okay let's actually clean up the
09:32 - database
09:34 - uh and remove all the stuff that is
09:38 - not cool so we have two epic cp
09:41 - communities we only need one for now
09:45 - uh yeah david can i
09:48 - can i ask please respond uh actually
09:50 - drop it on um
09:52 - so right now guys that this is my
09:55 - instagram handle please go ahead and if
09:56 - you have questions regarding this but uh
09:58 - please drop it there
10:00 - i will be responding to everybody and
10:02 - but i just want to
10:03 - keep this live as short as possible
10:06 - because
10:06 - yeah so yeah let's actually
10:10 - speed up a tiny bit now uh we are going
10:13 - to go ahead and debug whatever
10:15 - is happening over here and what we know
10:19 - is that it is inside of message.js still
10:25 - and what i see is
10:28 - it has a problem the anonymous function
10:31 - sender.email
10:32 - is not not an object okay let's see
10:36 - what is not cool so user email
10:40 - sender.email
10:42 - actually should be good though
10:46 - let's check it let's check up on it with
10:49 - postman so
10:50 - [Music]
10:53 - we should be able to get the
10:54 - conversation list that's
10:56 - working good uh we don't have a get data
11:00 - however we have the conversation data
11:03 - and let's actually oh
11:07 - okay let's copy this one
11:10 - let's go into here get back a
11:12 - conversation which we
11:14 - definitely should have
11:18 - um i've used code mirror package develop
11:21 - js
11:21 - oh actually i can check that out good
11:23 - idea thanks
11:25 - uh let's see how we have things going on
11:29 - on the back end so collection update is
11:32 - deprecated use
11:32 - update one oh my god everything is
11:36 - getting deprecated
11:38 - let's okay let's refresh uh
11:42 - some okay wrong port
11:46 - so inside of here we should be getting
11:48 - this email so that should be
11:50 - good
11:54 - so sender uh let me
11:57 - actually check up what is the actual
12:00 - endpoint that
12:01 - we are passing in here so
12:05 - uh message yes because we are not
12:08 - sending back
12:10 - uh we are not passing in that prop
12:14 - uh from the chat.js file and we need to
12:17 - address
12:18 - that thing so what i will be doing is i
12:20 - have this snippet of code over here
12:23 - and oh my god uh so that's actually i'm
12:26 - just gonna go ahead and paste it here
12:28 - and i'm gonna go ahead and explain what
12:30 - is happening so
12:31 - what we had was a bit different from
12:34 - this one
12:35 - we are we are going to pass in yes
12:37 - exactly with
12:38 - we don't have a sender as a prof on a
12:40 - message think yeah
12:41 - that's that's exactly why what was
12:43 - happening
12:44 - uh exactly and
12:50 - and now i need to pass this kind of id
12:53 - the mongodb kind of id
12:54 - i need to pass that in uh
12:58 - and twice as the key and as the id as
13:01 - well
13:02 - and in the sender i am passing in the
13:05 - whole
13:06 - user uh thing we have
13:09 - somewhere here so i i i
13:12 - am passing everything inside of here i'm
13:14 - chucking it in
13:15 - in the sender also i'm sending in a
13:17 - message and all that stuff
13:19 - so we are destructuring everything and
13:21 - yeah there
13:22 - is there it is so with that said
13:26 - actually it should be now working let's
13:29 - test it out
13:30 - and welcome back guys there we go
13:34 - massive thanks everybody who is coming
13:36 - back and who is here
13:38 - i appreciate you guys and
13:42 - welcome so let's continue where we left
13:45 - off
13:47 - and what i think we should do now is
13:50 - test
13:50 - it with an other message oh
13:53 - and uh we are going to merge the videos
13:56 - no i think we will be adding like part
13:58 - one part two
14:00 - uh so we need to address the
14:03 - thing that it is not working perfectly
14:06 - so
14:06 - it's not showing my face not showing the
14:08 - date and not showing the last message
14:11 - so what we will be doing is
14:15 - go ahead and on the sidebar chat
14:18 - we need to add all this stuff and we
14:21 - need to uh
14:22 - address the situation over there
14:25 - now what i am doing is again changing a
14:28 - bit of
14:29 - uh sunny's code i'm literally gonna
14:32 - uh get rid of this time ago thing
14:36 - it we could make it work but not today
14:39 - uh you guys could see that how it is
14:41 - working we will be going with the utc
14:43 - string
14:44 - for now and what we will do is pretty
14:47 - much
14:48 - as we uh set up all the last message
14:50 - last photo
14:51 - last time and all that stuff uh
14:54 - we will literally go ahead and go
14:58 - with that thing now inside of here we
15:01 - want to go
15:02 - and add the last timestamp we want to
15:05 - check everything in here and add the
15:08 - last
15:08 - message there we go
15:12 - and inside of here we want to pass in
15:14 - the last
15:15 - photo that is pretty much going to do
15:18 - all the work for
15:19 - us will this will be uh will this be
15:21 - available for a
15:23 - later watch yes it will be everything is
15:26 - going to be
15:27 - available for watch later uh we will
15:29 - make a part 1 and part 2 videos out of
15:32 - it
15:32 - uh and yeah thank you so much for uh
15:35 - coming back here and
15:37 - being here we are 100 people
15:40 - strong that's awesome okay now
15:43 - uh what we will be doing is that should
15:46 - actu that should have actually fixed
15:48 - that issue
15:50 - here we go and
15:53 - yeah let's test this thing out
15:57 - um and what i will be
16:02 - and what i will be doing is just add
16:05 - another message in here like
16:06 - saying hey and send this message and
16:10 - because
16:11 - and for some reason it actually okay
16:15 - so it's actually a uh
16:18 - my my computer type of issue what i need
16:22 - to do
16:22 - is go to um
16:28 - chat.js and or actually it's called
16:31 - chat.css
16:35 - and go all the way down so let's go into
16:38 - chat.css and
16:40 - find the button guys if it's working for
16:43 - you
16:44 - uh if it's working for you don't you
16:48 - don't have to do this for some reason uh
16:50 - on my computer the display none is just
16:53 - simply not
16:54 - working so instead i will be doing this
16:57 - stuff
16:58 - uh so i am adding a head of zero a width
17:00 - of zero an outline transparent
17:02 - background transparent in the border of
17:04 - none which is literally the exact same
17:07 - thing
17:08 - as display none it's just
17:11 - i don't know what's happening here i
17:12 - need to uh debug that but
17:15 - that's just it is what it is right
17:23 - uh yeah so with that said
17:27 - uh it should be working and it should be
17:30 - reloading because as you guys can see
17:33 - uh somewhere here somewhere here there
17:37 - is the
17:38 - message which says uh send
17:42 - yeah the send message it still says
17:44 - either prevent default we shouldn't
17:46 - enable
17:47 - reloading i gotta uh i gotta look into
17:50 - that so
17:51 - i'm gonna type in hey uh
17:55 - like this and go ahead and refresh it
17:58 - and it should
17:58 - actually yeah it actually updated over
18:01 - here
18:02 - and here we go so it actually showed up
18:05 - nice so now the only thing
18:09 - uh we will do buy a new macbook dude i
18:12 - just bought this one
18:15 - uh i just need to set something up
18:18 - so so
18:22 - what do we what so the only thing now
18:25 - left to do
18:26 - is guys go to pusher.com and make this
18:29 - app real time
18:30 - let's actually do that in a couple of
18:32 - minutes
18:33 - we should be able to do that in like ten
18:35 - or uh five minutes
18:37 - so let's go there and say
18:40 - so we got pusher going on in here and
18:43 - we are just going to sign in uh
18:46 - yep here we go let's go to manage let's
18:49 - go to create
18:50 - app you name it however you wish i will
18:53 - call it imessage
18:55 - live and
19:00 - let's use us west should be good
19:03 - and we have react and we also
19:07 - have some node.js going on the back end
19:11 - and we will go ahead and create the app
19:14 - now with that done it actually throws a
19:17 - couple of code at me
19:19 - uh there is actually let's actually go
19:21 - with the back end first copy that
19:24 - piece of code go back to server.js
19:27 - go up to app.config and what we will do
19:30 - is pretty much just paste it in here
19:32 - change the war to const and
19:35 - yeah that will pretty much do the uh
19:38 - instance work
19:39 - for us now you also need to go in here
19:42 - where
19:42 - uh we said uh db connected
19:46 - and you need to set up the chain stream
19:50 - which is essentially a thing that we are
19:53 - going to be using
19:54 - to trigger the pusher so what we will do
19:56 - is say
19:57 - const chain uh let's actually i'm i'll
20:00 - be using the snippets of
20:02 - code that i have uh so what we will be
20:06 - doing
20:06 - is pretty much just say uh we will set
20:10 - up the change stream
20:12 - which is super easy so cons chain stream
20:15 - mongoose connection collection uh and
20:18 - the
20:19 - collection that we are actually uh
20:20 - watching is going to be the
20:21 - conversations
20:23 - and we just add the watch at the end
20:26 - and next up what we will do is say
20:29 - uh change stream whoo
20:33 - the on change
20:36 - uh we will fire off the function with
20:38 - the change that actually happened
20:41 - and if there is a
20:44 - if the change is ah
20:48 - change dog oh
20:51 - uh it's ending there are few very few
20:53 - people
20:54 - that's right that's right but only the
20:57 - hardcore people are
20:58 - here are here at the end
21:02 - oh yeah you relate yeah
21:05 - so the operation type when the operation
21:07 - type is
21:08 - insert uh we are going to do some
21:11 - stuff and we want to go ahead and
21:14 - trigger the pusher
21:15 - with the messages uh oh no the
21:19 - chats uh stream
21:22 - and we want to say the uh the event is
21:24 - going to be
21:25 - new chat and once one and
21:28 - if the as if uh
21:31 - something else which means uh
21:34 - we are updating uh in the
21:37 - database then we want to go ahead and uh
21:41 - create another channel with another uh
21:45 - with another event and we pass it in
21:48 - again and if like let's handle
21:51 - all the errors that could happen so if
21:54 - that didn't work
21:55 - let's just console log the error
21:57 - triggering pusher
21:58 - now with that done the back end is
22:00 - actually ready to be
22:02 - uh real-time and let's actually
22:05 - go back to our front-end part and go to
22:08 - the sidebar.js
22:09 - file where we will actually first set up
22:13 - all the back all the real-time stuff now
22:17 - if you're scrolling up here in a bit
22:20 - you're good bro i just checked hey
22:23 - frankie
22:24 - what is going on we got frankie in the
22:26 - house
22:28 - yo uh so what we will be doing
22:32 - is pretty much uh can you do a twitch of
22:35 - course
22:36 - um what we will be doing is pretty much
22:39 - just
22:40 - uh copy this part of the code
22:43 - and let's actually set that instance
22:46 - up let's go to the sidebar sidebar
22:50 - chat.js file
22:53 - which sidebar chat.js
22:57 - oops hold on inside the bar
23:01 - chat.js yeah there we go that's what we
23:04 - wanted
23:04 - and we want to go up here like out of
23:07 - the uh
23:08 - whole function let's add the instance
23:12 - say cons instead of var because never
23:15 - ever use we don't ever use
23:18 - var uh now that we have that
23:22 - thing set up we should be
23:25 - able to go ahead and do the other type
23:28 - of connection
23:29 - so what we will be doing is add the uh
23:32 - inside of the use effect we will add
23:36 - this stuff so we are literally going
23:39 - ahead
23:40 - and creating a channel which means that
23:43 - uh
23:43 - with pusher we are subscribing to the
23:45 - messages channel
23:47 - and whenever uh something happens
23:51 - so so a new message thing happens we
23:53 - want to go ahead
23:54 - and get the sidebar elements again
23:58 - okay so that will literally just uh pull
24:01 - in
24:01 - all the the last message stuff okay if
24:04 - you guys remember it
24:05 - this is just getting back the data
24:09 - which we will be okay it's not defined
24:12 - just yet
24:13 - let's go ahead and do that um
24:18 - we are going to go ahead uh
24:23 - we will be doing like pusher for
24:26 - um and we will say
24:30 - oh i haven't even installed this so
24:33 - what we guys want to do now is go to the
24:36 - front end terminal
24:37 - and type in npm i pusher dash
24:41 - js right because on the front end we
24:44 - install the pusher.js and on the backend
24:46 - we are installing pusher
24:47 - as it is so once it will
24:50 - load up uh it should be pretty fast
24:56 - i said fast okay uh
25:02 - okay i think i'm stupid because my brain
25:04 - doesn't want to understand what redox is
25:06 - that's actually not right uh you just
25:09 - want to go ahead and
25:11 - and learn learn whatever you can find on
25:13 - the internet about it and watch
25:15 - all the redux videos that sunny has
25:18 - already
25:18 - dropped and thank you so much shimongi
25:22 - for that nice awesome comment thank you
25:24 - so much
25:26 - okay uh right so now we should be able
25:31 - to
25:31 - uh import pusher with a capital p
25:36 - from uh pusher.js
25:40 - because right this is what we're
25:42 - importing nice
25:44 - and what we will be doing is let's
25:46 - actually test out if it
25:47 - okay so this is the part that we just
25:50 - made real time right
25:52 - so actually if i go in here and say yo
25:56 - that part should update there we go
25:59 - so that part actually updated we are
26:02 - making the app piece by piece
26:04 - real time right so the oops
26:08 - so the other part just uh didn't get uh
26:11 - didn't update because that's not real
26:13 - time just yet
26:14 - but what we will do uh
26:18 - please do a cms app with mer of course
26:20 - drop me
26:21 - on instagram and i will make a list out
26:23 - of it and actually
26:24 - plan these lives the way you guys want
26:28 - it and the way you guys will get the
26:30 - most value out
26:31 - of which keyboard do you use
26:34 - apple magic keyboard okay uh
26:38 - next up what i will be doing is going to
26:42 - uh chad.js i think that should be
26:45 - the next one that we make real time
26:50 - so what we will be doing in here
26:53 - is pretty much yeah let's go to chat.js
26:57 - and in here we will actually need to add
27:00 - two different types of stuff first
27:04 - what we definitely want to do and i just
27:07 - i actually found this part
27:08 - uh found this piece out before the live
27:11 - stream
27:13 - that i should be actually adding it
27:14 - otherwise it will be bugging out
27:16 - so this is pusher unsubscribe messages
27:19 - this is how you want to start the uh
27:23 - use effect fanboy that's right
27:26 - um
27:30 - okay so pusher and subscribe
27:33 - with this will actually when the chat
27:36 - components
27:37 - loads so whenever we are actually
27:39 - switching between chats it
27:40 - actually reloads itself so that user
27:42 - fact actually
27:44 - fires off again because chat id changes
27:47 - and that is a dependency of the
27:49 - new use effect so then we are actually
27:52 - unsubscribing from the messages and that
27:54 - the reason for that
27:56 - is that we want to we don't want to
27:59 - subscribe to it multiply
28:00 - so right if you guys actually remember
28:03 - how pusher works on the front-end side
28:07 - we subscribe to channels right
28:09 - and if we subscribe to channels like
28:11 - multiple times
28:12 - then it will go ahead and refresh all
28:14 - the
28:16 - all this stuff right so if i'm in one
28:19 - chat and i'm
28:20 - entering to another one and then send a
28:22 - message there it will refresh both of
28:24 - them and it's going to be like
28:26 - giggling around and it's just not going
28:28 - to be a good user experience
28:30 - so that whenever we are changing
28:34 - uh chats you want to go ahead and
28:38 - you want to go ahead and unsubscribe
28:40 - from the for sure that you are already
28:42 - subscribed
28:42 - to and then subscribe to a new one
28:46 - i hope this actually made sense it was
28:48 - pretty fast
28:49 - but yeah uh drop me questions if you
28:53 - guys need more explanation
28:55 - okay so what we will then do
28:58 - is pretty much just say um
29:02 - uh subscribe to the new one and
29:06 - that will actually okay that will
29:09 - actually go ahead and say
29:12 - of course we're subscribing to the same
29:14 - channel again
29:16 - exactly rerender stuff many many times
29:18 - we don't want to do that
29:20 - okay and we want to we want to just do
29:23 - whatever we did with the other one so
29:26 - now uh what i think should be
29:30 - happening is next up we need to make
29:33 - the sidebar so right so before that the
29:37 - the other one
29:38 - was the sidebar chat right so that's
29:40 - actually
29:41 - two different type of stuff one of them
29:43 - is going to watch out whenever a new
29:45 - chat is getting added
29:47 - and the other one is watching out for
29:48 - the new messages so that it actually
29:50 - updates the thumbnail
29:51 - and whatever that is in there now let's
29:54 - go ahead and jump
29:58 - into sidebar.js and this is going to be
30:00 - the last piece
30:02 - if you're not running into any bug and
30:04 - this is going to be the last step
30:06 - that we are covering today uh
30:09 - and here we go so
30:12 - that should actually do it notice that
30:15 - we are subscribing to chats now
30:17 - and not new chat and you guys might be
30:20 - asking
30:21 - why are weren't we unsubscribe here and
30:23 - cyborg.js file
30:26 - um that's part that's because we don't
30:30 - need to
30:30 - okay so you only want to unsubscribe to
30:33 - it when you're
30:34 - when you need to and the other thing the
30:37 - reason
30:37 - the other reason is that only the chat
30:39 - gets actually re-rendered
30:41 - that many times when we are changing
30:43 - chats uh the sidebar stays consistent
30:46 - because react actually cleverly knows
30:48 - what part of the
30:50 - screen to re-render and okay
30:53 - now let's actually go ahead and test
30:56 - this thing
30:56 - out uh on
30:59 - in sidebar it's not actually existing
31:02 - let's go ahead and import
31:04 - that oh because i haven't created
31:07 - the uh i haven't actually added this
31:11 - part
31:12 - so let's do that and sidebar is loaded
31:15 - everything
31:16 - yeah remember me yeah i remember you
31:20 - okay let's actually add this thing here
31:23 - and
31:24 - change the word to const and you also
31:26 - want to go ahead and import
31:29 - item import pusher
31:32 - from pusher.js yeah with
31:36 - js okay let's see what
31:39 - we missed or haven't missed yeah chat.js
31:43 - let's go into chat.js
31:45 - and chat.js we haven't subscribed there
31:49 - either
31:50 - so we just want to go in and say pusher
31:54 - from pusher.js
31:58 - and we should be good to go in any
32:01 - minute so say const
32:04 - thanks think a bit uh we are saying
32:07 - const
32:07 - and we i think now now
32:11 - no now we should be good okay okay so
32:14 - i'm going
32:15 - into epic cp community and say
32:18 - you guys are awesome
32:24 - and add some fire because you guys are
32:27 - on fire
32:29 - and boom there we go
32:32 - it updated over here we updated it
32:36 - over here and we are go
32:39 - good okay uh
32:43 - please explain how to understand error
32:45 - messages
32:47 - that's actually uh a really good
32:50 - question as she won he says
32:53 - um honestly try to read it
32:56 - it's good okay this is one of the most
33:00 - demanded questions ever
33:01 - okay so how to understand error messages
33:05 - uh so you guys wanna actually understand
33:08 - what is actually
33:10 - right right right you want to read it
33:12 - through word by word
33:13 - it's going to be stupid but sometimes it
33:15 - actually makes sense
33:16 - but when it doesn't make sense you want
33:18 - to go ahead and google it up and then
33:20 - essentially when you google it up so
33:23 - much time
33:24 - you wanna you will essentially
33:26 - understand it
33:28 - by feeling okay and i am today
33:31 - still running into uh issues that i'm
33:33 - looking at like
33:34 - excuse me like what and then i still go
33:38 - ahead and google it up and that's the
33:40 - only way that i can find it and then
33:41 - literally go ahead and copy paste the
33:43 - whole thing into google
33:44 - and there is going to be a stack
33:45 - overflow article about it
33:47 - okay uh and now the only thing we need
33:51 - to test
33:51 - out is if the sidebar is actually real
33:54 - time so we will say
33:55 - youtube over here we will add a welcome
33:58 - message
33:59 - yo and some fire and a
34:03 - rocket nice and if we add it
34:06 - it should pop up immediately with the
34:09 - welcome message
34:10 - and guys we actually
34:13 - are done with today's build it was
