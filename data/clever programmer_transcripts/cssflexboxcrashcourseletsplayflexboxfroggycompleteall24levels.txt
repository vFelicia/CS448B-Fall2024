00:00 - yo what is up guys how's it going let's
00:02 - get that thing going I'm gonna do
00:04 - flexbox froggy I've never done this
00:06 - before and it's been a long time since I
00:08 - even did anything with flexbox cuz I
00:10 - don't do a lot of stuff with frontend
00:12 - but let's just jump right into it so I'm
00:14 - gonna do this live and go through it and
00:17 - so if anybody is your first time great
00:19 - follow along I think you're gonna have a
00:20 - lot of fun I'm listening to some music
00:23 - at the same time so I got some good
00:25 - energy going right now
00:27 - so okay welcome to flexbox froggy a game
00:29 - where you help froggy and friends by
00:33 - writing CSS code awesome I love games
00:35 - guide the frog to the lily pad on the
00:38 - right by using the justified content so
00:40 - I got to use justified content to get
00:43 - him there which aligns items
00:45 - horizontally and accepts the following
00:46 - values so interesting it can take in
00:51 - flex start items online to the left side
00:53 - of the container it can take Flex end
00:55 - items aligned to the right side of the
00:57 - container mmm maybe I need to use Flex
00:59 - in right-center would just put them in
01:01 - the center space between we'll see what
01:04 - that does in space from round so okay
01:09 - cool they're giving us the answer right
01:10 - there so here's the actual code pond
01:13 - display flex so I'm imagining pond is
01:18 - this thing right over here so if you had
01:20 - a group if you had the thing the thing
01:25 - and you selected the thing the container
01:28 - the div or whatever right with that or
01:31 - ID right that's ID hashtag sign and then
01:36 - you used flex and that thing would go
01:39 - all the way to the right so flex box is
01:41 - awesome for yeah like for organizing
01:45 - stuff and like putting things in their
01:47 - own containers and then like it's all
01:48 - responsive so even if you like do this
01:51 - stuff it all works out so let's take
01:54 - let's just try it
02:07 - cool so that's what that did right now
02:15 - what would happen if we did flex start
02:19 - this light is going crazy give me one
02:21 - second all right let's keep going so
02:23 - what would happen if I did Center so
02:26 - this is where you'll learn the most you
02:28 - know people a lot of times will just
02:29 - type this in and then they're like oh
02:31 - yeah I'm good
02:32 - I just type this isn't I'm good no you
02:34 - gotta you gotta try everything else you
02:35 - gotta try Center and see what happens
02:37 - make predictions too don't just follow
02:38 - along and be a dummy like make
02:40 - predictions like I wanna do Center
02:41 - I assume it's gonna go to the center so
02:45 - that part is important like don't miss
02:47 - out on that okay and then try everything
02:50 - like flex like Center
02:52 - okay space between what's gonna happen
02:54 - mmm seemingly nothing happened space
02:58 - around something happened moved around
03:02 - like start I imagine just gonna put them
03:04 - flex start just gonna put them at the
03:07 - start cool flex n all right nice let's
03:12 - move on next level what do we need to do
03:16 - we got a yep green kinda yellow guy
03:18 - interesting I assume yellow guy needs to
03:20 - go there green guy needs to go there so
03:23 - I need to move them both I imagine I
03:25 - mean I'm not even looking at this so
03:27 - this is another thing I want to tell you
03:28 - don't even look at the thing first make
03:30 - your own assumption see what's going on
03:32 - I learned this a lot from chess when
03:33 - you're playing chess you're looking at
03:35 - the chess puzzle just jump in there and
03:36 - see what's on the board what's going on
03:38 - what can you tell about the board right
03:40 - can you attack are you down a piece do
03:43 - you have your queen or your queen down
03:44 - can you play a checkmate or you got to
03:46 - play more positional you got to think in
03:48 - lots of different ways so here I've been
03:50 - thinking about my gut feeling is just a
03:52 - center before I even look at what
03:54 - they're telling me it just seems like
03:55 - you got to move it over so I'm just
03:57 - gonna try that before I read what what
03:59 - they said justify what was a content
04:03 - like that content center hey let's go
04:12 - you know I gotta put some music on just
04:14 - gonna be sick
04:17 - all right so I hope you guys I hope that
04:21 - that was clear and it's centered online
04:23 - I think that's obvious I think you got
04:25 - it - ooh grid garden
04:28 - hey that's gonna be the next game we're
04:30 - gonna play grid garden so Center on line
04:33 - moves it to the center perfect great
04:35 - just keep moving forward
04:40 - all right so these all three need to
04:43 - move over I mean I'm just gonna imagine
04:45 - center justify content Center Oh mmm
05:01 - interesting
05:05 - another thing is always remember you
05:08 - always got to put display flex otherwise
05:10 - that div that ID whatever you're
05:13 - selecting right in this case upon it
05:15 - doesn't enable flex mode so this enables
05:19 - the flex mode and then this is actually
05:22 - what does the trick
05:24 - all right so help all frogs by just if
05:27 - icon this time that lily pads have space
05:29 - all around them if you find yourself
05:33 - forgetting okay so I mean I think they
05:37 - gave me a hint so I'm gonna go and
05:39 - remove this and see what happens so I
05:41 - imagine space around so then this way
05:44 - they kind of spread space around and a
05:52 - space between cool there we go
05:57 - a lot of it guys play with trial and
05:59 - error what I want you to understand
06:01 - about coding is don't think of it like a
06:04 - mathematician and a scientist make it
06:06 - play try stuff break stuff try stuff
06:09 - break stuff don't try to get it perfect
06:11 - I don't care somebody's laughing at me
06:12 - right now and they're like eh maybe if
06:13 - you just read the documentation play
06:16 - mess it up then go read the
06:19 - documentation then everything is gonna
06:21 - make a lot of sense but get it at an
06:23 - emotional and intuitive level cool let's
06:25 - keep going all right so now next up we
06:29 - got
06:30 - boom-boom-boom okay so this guy is good
06:33 - here this guy needs to go here so what
06:37 - I'm thinking is can I try something like
06:39 - space between so it's like ill create a
06:44 - space between these two and then they'll
06:46 - create the space between these two so
06:48 - like space here and space here will
06:51 - likely move this guy here and this guy
06:53 - here I mean it could be a reach but
06:56 - let's try it justify content space
07:01 - between I think I got okay so I get I'm
07:08 - getting the hang of it a little bit more
07:10 - I'm intuitively trying to I'm starting
07:11 - to understand it space around I think
07:15 - what that means is like put space around
07:17 - here
07:18 - and here that's why they move in between
07:23 - so like if I go space around
07:26 - oops right if you do space around it
07:31 - seems like it puts space here and space
07:33 - here that's why the center guy stays
07:35 - where he is he doesn't move space
07:38 - between I love this because I'm learning
07:40 - for the first time really how to
07:42 - intuitively understand this and then
07:44 - this these guys stay put right they
07:46 - don't move but this guy moves because
07:50 - this goes right over there or something
07:52 - right cool let's keep going okay now
07:57 - they need to move down so what is that
08:00 - flexed aren't notes like that no Center
08:03 - no baseline that would you be the only
08:09 - thing that makes sense I mean I imagine
08:11 - this is the baseline I have no idea
08:13 - let's try it justify content baseline
08:20 - mmm
08:22 - that didn't do anything stretch
08:30 - flex an interesting align items so we're
08:40 - not doing justify content anymore we're
08:42 - doing a line items I think tell the
08:50 - frogs get to the bottom of the pond
08:55 - interesting this yes says properly
09:00 - aligns items vertically and accepts the
09:03 - following values so I imagine flex start
09:12 - ah okay justify content is horizontal
09:15 - this is vertical right that's the fun
09:17 - part okay got it got it got it so I
09:20 - imagine flex end of this will bring you
09:22 - down here and flex start of this will
09:23 - keep you up here okay aligned items flex
09:26 - and nice let's keep going let's keep
09:29 - going guys let's keep the energy up in
09:31 - here we gotta go and finish the whole
09:33 - thing I've got to finish the whole thing
09:35 - I got to move my face somewhere else
09:38 - let's move it right there
09:43 - alright so I gotta move him to the
09:46 - middle interesting so I gotta use a
09:49 - combination so this is nice this is such
09:53 - cool exercises so I got to move him to
10:00 - the middle horizontally into the middle
10:02 - vertically that will get me here and if
10:05 - I do a squared plus B squared is equal
10:08 - to C squared carry over the one probably
10:13 - none of that right and justify Continent
10:19 - content center so that's step one got
10:22 - him there and then I got a line items
10:28 - center right center center yeah let's go
10:33 - this is fun man I'm having fun I'm
10:36 - loving this this is done really really
10:38 - well I gotta move these three guys hmm
10:44 - hmmm let's see let's see what we have
10:48 - here
10:49 - I see so what would I do
10:54 - I would it seemed like there's space
10:59 - around right there's space around so I
11:02 - was used space around and then I would
11:04 - move it vertically to the end so it
11:07 - needs to move vertically to the end and
11:09 - then horizontally it needs space around
11:17 - right this space right here in this
11:20 - space right there so let's get to work
11:23 - so horizontal what's the horizontal one
11:27 - come on you got it tell me justify
11:28 - content that's right I'm gonna start
11:30 - asking you questions now so if you're
11:32 - here watching this you're not just
11:33 - passively learning you got to put your
11:35 - mind into it okay let's go so justifying
11:38 - content what am I going to be doing
11:39 - space around cool looks like they are
11:43 - matching right now so that looks good
11:46 - Bam Bam Bam and now I got a do what a
11:51 - line items and it's gonna be flex and
11:59 - put us on my colon boom done let's go
12:05 - let's go and if any of you guys want to
12:08 - play chess you know we can do that too
12:10 - just hit me up interesting so they gotta
12:14 - go there there and there
12:16 - huh so red one is exactly where he needs
12:20 - to be uh okay so it seems like I got a
12:25 - kind of reverse there direction so red
12:28 - one what the green would go here yellow
12:30 - would flip the way you you think about
12:34 - it it's kind of like green one goes here
12:36 - and then comes out of there and goes
12:38 - plop yellow one goes there comes out of
12:41 - here it goes plop and red one goes here
12:44 - comes out of there and goes bloop so
12:48 - some kind of reverse so I'm gonna do
12:50 - flex this is the property direction
12:54 - and we're gonna do not row rows by
12:58 - defaults so like try it for example you
13:01 - notice that nothing happens we got into
13:03 - row reverse there we go boom boom boom
13:06 - boom boom
13:08 - cool mm-hmm so why can't I just align
13:18 - this at the boat oh now I can't align at
13:20 - the bottom okay I see so it can't do
13:22 - that I have to try now it's a row I got
13:26 - I may be making a column yeah I gotta
13:29 - make it a column and just a straight-up
13:31 - column non reversing or anything like
13:32 - that right because once I do that cuz
13:36 - okay so this is a row right this is row
13:41 - reverse right and then this is I imagine
13:46 - a column and then I imagine that is call
13:50 - reverse so with that in mind I think I
13:54 - got this I think I just do flex
13:58 - direction direction and then I do a
14:01 - column that shouldn't do it let's go
14:04 - boom a so what's happening here some
14:09 - kind of reverse maybe looks like a
14:12 - reversal but what would a reversal do
14:16 - reversal would bring this grain here
14:20 - that's not what we want right so yeah I
14:27 - would bring the green right there it
14:29 - would bring the yellow right there and
14:32 - it would bring this guy right over here
14:35 - so once they're here here and here we
14:43 - need to push them over so that goes
14:45 - there that goes here that goes here so
14:47 - the first step I'm imagining is a
14:49 - reverse right so first step is gonna be
14:53 - the reverse step one right step one is
14:56 - gonna bring them here and here here
14:57 - that's step one that's a reverse and
15:01 - then we need to move them here here and
15:04 - here and that looks like
15:07 - flex end like we got to justify the
15:12 - content move it to the end so let's try
15:14 - that we're gonna do justify no sorry
15:18 - flex Direction we're gonna do roll
15:23 - reverse uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
15:28 - that's what that did that's what I
15:30 - expected and then we're gonna do justify
15:35 - content a mmm flex and a let's go cool
15:48 - always be thinking right what's
15:49 - happening what's that it's in games I'm
15:51 - playing we're having fun okay
15:53 - don't forget that you're having fun
15:55 - that's the most important thing you have
15:56 - to understand okay this is all fun guys
16:00 - this is all fun I hope this is exciting
16:02 - to you all right so we got justified
16:05 - contents all right now we got to move
16:07 - these guys down so I'm imagining put
16:10 - them in a column and then Center it and
16:13 - then reverse it No
16:23 - put it in a column so then it will be
16:27 - like boom boom boom and then I imagine
16:29 - reverse no not room
16:31 - oh and head hurts and chest normally you
16:40 - just make a move you don't overthink it
16:41 - you just go but you know encoding
16:43 - sometimes you gotta like think ok so
16:49 - we'll have if I do column oh but what if
16:56 - I do column reverse then green one comes
17:01 - here yellow one comes there man
17:09 - this one is hurting my head ok so let's
17:14 - do let's do flex direction right a cool
17:26 - now let's check what happens if I do
17:28 - reverse so that's not what we want right
17:39 - so we got the column now what would
17:43 - happen if I reverse this well that's not
17:46 - what we want either right because if I
17:48 - reverse this I imagine green would end
17:50 - there yellow would end here what would
18:02 - roll reverse look like
18:20 - oh I got it I was just having like a
18:22 - brain freeze this is just simple flex
18:25 - vertically flex and so let me just try
18:28 - flex so I'm gonna do justify content so
18:38 - like the confusing part is that even
18:40 - though because now it's a column you can
18:43 - actually just justify content so it's
18:46 - not actually moving it horizontal it's
18:49 - moving it vertically even the justified
18:51 - content is supposed to move horizontally
18:52 - so that's the part that's a little
18:54 - confusing but I think this should work
18:55 - if I just do flex and yeah so it gets a
19:02 - little funny how you have to think about
19:04 - it in your heads this is getting all
19:06 - convoluted okay so some kind of reverse
19:16 - and then call them so let's just do flex
19:20 - direction first flex Direction column so
19:27 - let's just do that cool and now I think
19:30 - I just got to put space between and why
19:36 - I'm doing a space between between I mean
19:41 - I can just reverse it right like oh I
19:45 - can just do column reverse Col there we
19:48 - go so I did a space between because
19:51 - remember space between creates these
19:53 - spaces space around creates these spaces
19:56 - so we don't want that we don't want
19:58 - space outside should be called space
20:00 - outside we want space in between so
20:04 - there we go
20:08 - cool now we need to move these three
20:11 - guys over where I got to move my face so
20:16 - you got to move these three guys to the
20:18 - center then align them all over the
20:21 - bottom and then reverse it that's easy
20:24 - so justify contents center and then we
20:31 - got to
20:32 - line items flex and then we do flex
20:39 - direction reverse their row reverse
20:46 - that's it boom you'll start to see
20:51 - patterns guys so now we got a class dot
20:56 - yellow and then this div right so pond
20:59 - is a div and then this is a class and
21:02 - we're CSS right this is CSS styling
21:05 - right here cool
21:09 - sometimes reversing the row of a column
21:11 - order of a container is not enough in
21:13 - this case so we can apply the order
21:14 - property to individual items by default
21:18 - I don't have a value of zero but we can
21:20 - use it probably set it to a positive use
21:23 - the order property to reorder the frogs
21:24 - according to their lily pads I don't
21:35 - exactly understand
21:45 - hmm I don't get it what am i typing here
21:55 - any hints
22:09 - order to huh and what what is going on I
22:20 - can just type in anything and it works
22:29 - negative 2 negative 3 so we're selecting
22:35 - okay so it seemed
22:48 - so
22:59 - okay so we can control each of these
23:06 - guys right now with the dot yellow thing
23:09 - I think what it's doing is controlling
23:11 - this yellow frog and this yellow frog by
23:15 - default is zero so zero means it's
23:17 - exactly where it's ads gonna stay there
23:19 - if I hit negative one it's supposed to
23:21 - go over to the left and if I had
23:23 - positive one it's gonna go over one to
23:25 - the right cool got it now I understand
23:30 - weird tutorial that one holy crap what
23:35 - is happening
23:47 - so this red one we need to move it over
23:53 - by one two and three so this is negative
23:56 - 1 this is negative 2 this is 0 and this
23:59 - is negative 3 let's try negative 3 ha ha
24:07 - yo this is wait what
24:12 - that doesn't make sense I didn't knew
24:19 - whatever and it works
24:20 - why does negative 1 work I don't
24:22 - understand that because the rest of it I
24:26 - guess is green still don't understand
24:29 - how does that swap with the green
24:33 - somebody wants to explain that to me in
24:35 - the comments I'll reply to this video go
24:37 - ahead I'm open years I don't understand
24:39 - that one I'll keep going though line
24:44 - self and align items all right we got
24:48 - flex we got flex start cool yellow needs
24:55 - to go to the bottom so another property
24:58 - can apply this property accepts the
25:00 - values and its value for this huh
25:06 - Alliance self
25:12 - flex and nice that's cool
25:16 - align self so I imagine justify self is
25:19 - also a thing combined order of the line
25:23 - self to help the frogs get to their
25:25 - destination so who are getting fancy
25:26 - here so what are we doing here we want
25:41 - so we need to move it to the bottom and
25:44 - then we have to an aligned self I guess
25:54 - what applied every yellow frog because
25:56 - that's what we're selecting so aligned
25:57 - socially it's like okay flex end and
26:00 - then what do we need to do then we need
26:03 - to do something about order let's try
26:10 - let's try order two huh
26:17 - this disorder stuff doesn't make any
26:20 - sense to me
26:29 - call Harvard well what I didn't do it Oh
26:34 - Oh have to put a semicolon here
27:13 - no rap interesting rap ooh
27:18 - rap is nice so if you have like multiple
27:21 - images if you have images alike
27:23 - automatically wrap and then I imagine
27:26 - you know once you do anything it will
27:30 - like got it and then we got rapper verse
27:36 - and all of that so rap and then wrap so
27:42 - yeah flex direction is going to be call
27:46 - them and then I think it's gonna be oh
27:51 - wait flex rap rap interesting mm-hmm man
28:10 - almost there let's keep going
28:13 - the two properties flex direction and
28:15 - flex wrap our use are used often
28:20 - together cool flex direction and
28:23 - flexwrap interesting flex flow ro rap
28:35 - interesting just set it to rows and then
28:39 - wrap them if flex flow instead of row
28:44 - rap I think we're gonna do call them rap
28:48 - because that's actually what that is
28:59 - the frogs are all spit over the lip has
29:02 - a bunch at the top you can use a line
29:04 - content as said how multiple lines are
29:09 - spaced apart from each other this
29:12 - property to take a following values line
29:18 - content we have not done the lion
29:20 - content yet
29:34 - so this is when you have so aligned
29:39 - items is between like here and here and
29:42 - all that stuff like I guess in there and
29:45 - then online content is when you have
29:46 - multiple rows huh interesting
29:53 - holy crap I'm blocking the view no
29:57 - matter where I'm at in the shuffle I'm
29:58 - gonna make myself one of the
30:00 - froggies right there just kidding
30:08 - aligned contents flex end just not what
30:14 - we want
30:17 - Center that's not what we want either
30:22 - hmm I think we want
30:35 - so we won't I mean it doesn't look like
30:38 - we want flex end okay let me just think
30:40 - about this real quick flex and wouldn't
30:42 - make sense because then this will come
30:45 - here these will come here and these will
30:46 - come here so that's bad so not that flex
30:53 - Center also wouldn't work because these
30:55 - will go down so that's by default bad
30:58 - space between will also not work I mean
31:05 - these will get centralized but then what
31:09 - about them and there's only supposed to
31:16 - be one line of code so let's try space
31:19 - between because outside of that stretch
31:29 - that didn't do anything
31:33 - oh yeah Affleck start okay that would
31:38 - make a lot of sense that makes a lot of
31:40 - sense
31:41 - I just thought by default everything is
31:43 - flex start but okay
31:45 - okay okay
31:56 - now the currents bunching a little line
31:59 - con to the guide the frogs there so a
32:01 - line I guess flex and right elects a
32:04 - line content flex and great what's
32:12 - happening now let's see it's time to go
32:15 - home time to the frogs have had a party
32:18 - but it's time to go home use a
32:19 - combination of flex direction Fleck
32:21 - align content to get them to their lily
32:24 - pads so it's a pretty wild party here
32:27 - but nothing we cannot handle what's the
32:32 - pattern that I'm seeing here
32:34 - oh man flex direction online content how
32:39 - are these yellow guys are gonna go home
32:41 - and these red guys gonna go there that's
32:44 - kind of crazy so let's see the pattern
32:48 - here so flex direction first of all
32:53 - we're gonna need to put everything in
32:57 - rows because all of these are supposed
33:00 - to be rows right so I'm imagining the
33:03 - first thing we would need to do is make
33:04 - sure we got row so for flex direction so
33:07 - that's good now when we do put it at
33:12 - rows I imagine red is gonna go and
33:15 - yellow is gonna go at the bottom green
33:16 - is gonna stay exactly where it's at so
33:18 - then I imagine we're gonna have to do a
33:20 - line content and we're gonna have to do
33:24 - reverse so then the Reds oh sorry the
33:29 - Reds go here and then the yellows will
33:31 - come there so let's give it a try
33:34 - flex direction row
33:52 - hmm
33:58 - oh man what is happening here hmm never
34:05 - mind
34:09 - so my Flex direction what is supposed to
34:14 - RORO reverse column colin river so it's
34:17 - just
34:25 - hold on let's try a line content flex
34:30 - start let's see it happens okay
34:35 - Center what are the properties that we
34:45 - have Center center space around okay
35:16 - how did that I don't understand how that
35:21 - worked
35:21 - column
35:32 - huh weird so okay so I guess I mean this
35:38 - is a real this famille up your head
35:41 - I mean this is getting funny now so call
35:44 - them I guess moves I don't have a good
35:48 - way to think about it I'm gonna be
35:49 - honest I feel a bit disoriented
35:51 - disoriented but I'm gonna keep going so
35:54 - I'm gonna do column reverse and I
35:55 - imagine that's the solution there we go
35:58 - cool almost there guys last challenge so
36:02 - this is gonna require a lot of coding
36:04 - here lots of stuff I just I really don't
36:07 - like a lion content and order stuff
36:09 - that's where it gets funny so but let's
36:13 - let's try so I'm imagining I think ro
36:22 - reverse would get us a good start
36:24 - because these yellows will go there and
36:30 - then red and the Greens would come there
36:31 - so let's let's try that flex direction
36:39 - row reverse okay I'm also thinking this
36:47 - these locals squeezed to me so I'm
36:49 - imagining we got to wrap it up a little
36:51 - bit
36:52 - flexwrap row wrap
37:17 - hmm a line-items
37:28 - Center lots of testing here guys
37:39 - ok that looks somewhat right call them
37:45 - reverse I guess no
37:53 - [Music]
38:05 - okay column looks somewhat good to me
38:09 - because I feel like if I Center
38:13 - something might happen I don't know what
38:19 - order is gonna do order would probably
38:24 - not do anything here it seems right like
38:36 - it seems like this goes there these go
38:42 - right there and these go there there's
38:46 - like if this is there look at the agonal
38:48 - reverse I think that would do the trick
38:54 - hmm aligned items
39:28 - Center baseline stretch stretch
39:38 - oh I think I'm looking for justify
39:59 - content right justify content space
40:05 - between
40:16 - oh man
40:19 - I don't know what is happening here guys
40:22 - I might have to cheat here a little bit
40:57 - well yeah I need to remember you could
40:59 - use flex flow and just put both of those
41:01 - together because they say you do those
41:03 - together a lot align content there we go
41:24 - that's what I was trying to do I was
41:26 - supposed to use align content and not
41:28 - align items I'm not just I'm just not
41:32 - familiar enough yet to know the
41:34 - difference between the two that much now
41:41 - flex direction here we go now flex
41:44 - direction is freed up to be used again
41:47 - row reverse no column
42:10 - what are the all the directions row
42:12 - reversed column reverse
42:31 - what am I doing here how in the world do
42:38 - I get these two two in the middle while
42:41 - I get all of these swapped
43:26 - call them reverse alright feel like I
43:36 - need some kind of reverse but I don't
43:38 - think any of these other guys there's an
43:40 - order but I don't know how to use order
43:43 - like can I do
44:06 - I cannot use it I mean I got to be
44:08 - outside of this property so can't do
44:10 - that rap reverse interesting flexwrap
44:18 - was this rap reverse
44:25 - I would never Todd dad sons of
44:31 - this is why you gotta be you gotta read
44:33 - documentation I guess so okay we have
44:36 - rapper verse because I was looking for
44:38 - some kind of reversal I what I started
44:39 - doing is literally like does this have
44:42 - reversed does this have reverse just
44:44 - kept going because that's what I need it
44:45 - so flexwrap had it reversed that I can
44:48 - use apparently and I knew flex flow
44:50 - would have that too if flexwrap had it
44:55 - now the only thing I can think of is to
44:58 - Center some Center stuff because this is
45:01 - perfectly fit so this will stay there so
45:04 - now I just got to Center it a line the
45:11 - line items Center know myself
45:25 - something has to be centered flex
45:28 - direction no
45:36 - and the only ones I can try sigh I'm
45:39 - just gonna keep trying centers now
45:41 - justify content okay there we go
45:44 - and now some kind of reverse guys one
45:47 - more reverse is gonna do it we're
45:50 - getting there
45:51 - copy this code align items as line items
45:58 - have a reverse no myself no already use
46:04 - flex wrap wait
46:18 - we have not used Flex Direction a column
46:30 - haha hey we did it let's go hey so that
46:44 - was definitely a funny one but we did it
46:48 - great work guys let's hit next woo we
46:56 - did it let's go
46:59 - awesome job if you suck around here
47:01 - great work send me a message below just
47:07 - let me know what you thought of this
47:08 - resist was fun if this brought you value
47:10 - do let me know
47:10 - I might make more of these I got to
47:12 - learn something I thought it was also
47:14 - gonna be fun and valuable hopefully for
47:16 - you guys that's it guys I love your
47:17 - faces cause II and I'll see you in the
47:19 - next video
