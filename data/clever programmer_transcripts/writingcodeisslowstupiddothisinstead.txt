00:00 - i know you're sitting there watching my
00:02 - face right now
00:04 - i also know you sit there and write code
00:08 - and i think writing code is slow and
00:11 - stupid
00:15 - so what should you do instead um
00:20 - it's just the truth of the matter okay
00:22 - if you are sitting there
00:25 - by hand writing code which pretty soon
00:28 - gpt 3 is going to be doing for you just
00:30 - kidding i mean that's going to take a
00:32 - while
00:33 - you're taking a ton of time and it's
00:36 - just making you slower and the
00:37 - result that you yourself are trying to
00:40 - get
00:41 - and the reason is that you're putting
00:43 - the how
00:46 - before you're putting the what
00:49 - all right so let me actually
00:52 - explain that all right let's remove that
00:54 - here real quick
00:55 - you're putting the how versus what
00:59 - so when you start coding before you even
01:02 - know what you're trying to code
01:04 - what is the main thing that you're
01:05 - trying to do you're just kind of
01:07 - coding away and that's getting you stuck
01:11 - into these areas where you're trying to
01:13 - build an app or you're trying to build
01:14 - something and it's just going like
01:16 - we instead of making forward progress
01:19 - right this is what it should look like
01:21 - point
01:21 - a point b but you
01:25 - sometimes look like
01:28 - who broke the code and like wrote a lot
01:31 - of code
01:31 - right this happens to us sometimes
01:33 - software developers happens to me too
01:34 - right
01:35 - almost to the b line but then we start
01:38 - going backwards all right
01:40 - so what do you need to do to make sure
01:43 - that you just go
01:44 - straight from point a to point b now
01:46 - it's never going to be that smooth
01:48 - first of all but even with that said
01:51 - what are some things that you can try to
01:53 - make it maybe
01:54 - a little bit smoother what what are the
01:56 - things you can do
01:57 - so here's what you can do
02:01 - focus on
02:04 - not before before i just give you the
02:08 - answer and what it is that you need to
02:09 - do right
02:12 - i want you to understand what happens
02:13 - when you do this when you're constantly
02:15 - like moving around and circling around
02:17 - and not making forward progress
02:19 - you're killing your confidence okay this
02:22 - is where a lot of times developer will
02:24 - develop something called imposter
02:26 - syndrome where you're like hey
02:28 - i am stuck i don't think i'm good enough
02:30 - and developers feel that even at jobs
02:33 - and mostly it's because they're not
02:35 - making forward progress they're kind of
02:36 - just stuck in this
02:38 - weird loop where it's it's repetitive
02:42 - and not a lot of progress is happening
02:46 - this is where you need to think like a
02:50 - software
02:51 - developer all right and what does that
02:53 - mean think like a software developer oh
02:55 - because you think like a software
02:56 - developer such a big term i'm just gonna
02:58 - throw this at me and
02:59 - have me figure it out no that's what i'm
03:01 - here for i'm gonna help you with this
03:03 - okay but help me with something hit that
03:05 - blue button
03:05 - hit that thumbs up button so that button
03:08 - turns blue because it'll really help
03:09 - this video go out
03:11 - and um again subscribe to the channel if
03:13 - you haven't already this is where we
03:14 - focus on full stack development
03:16 - and react and many other things okay so
03:19 - do that and let's continue with this so
03:23 - what does it mean to think like a
03:24 - software developer well what that
03:26 - basically means
03:26 - is you need to actually think and do a
03:29 - lot of thinking
03:30 - so one thing i recommend before you
03:32 - start chopping it up and start writing
03:34 - code i need you to sit there and
03:37 - actually
03:38 - write out and plan out whiteboard things
03:43 - okay and all that means is you can even
03:45 - take a piece of napkin and draw out
03:47 - things on there as you're trying to
03:48 - solve your problem or figure out a
03:50 - solution
03:51 - i want you to also
03:54 - write down right in plain english
03:59 - what you're trying to achieve
04:03 - because you'll realize there's a lot of
04:06 - crap
04:07 - that you don't need when sometimes you
04:09 - get bogged down by writing code
04:11 - you're just going to be coding your
04:12 - coding coding and coding it and then
04:14 - realize you're heading in the wrong
04:15 - direction the entire time
04:18 - you're setting yourself up for failure
04:21 - and so by making sure
04:23 - that you're writing pseudo code right
04:25 - one of the things i want you to look
04:26 - up is pseudocode
04:29 - learn how to properly write pseudo code
04:32 - learn
04:33 - how to take your ideas and turn them
04:35 - into words
04:38 - okay plain and in your language whatever
04:40 - your language is right
04:42 - but turn your ideas into words write it
04:44 - in english what you're trying to achieve
04:46 - if you're trying to make a game like
04:48 - rock paper scissors or tic-tac-toe
04:50 - or if you're trying to make an
04:51 - application make sure you know what it
04:53 - does
04:54 - okay when i hit the withdraw button it
04:57 - should
04:57 - help me take the money out but if the
05:01 - user
05:01 - hasn't put in an amount like 45 dollars
05:04 - then it should not withdraw anything as
05:07 - a matter of fact the withdrawal button
05:08 - should be disabled and
05:10 - unclickable okay so
05:14 - withdraw button should be disabled
05:18 - unless
05:22 - the user inputs and amount this is just
05:24 - an example
05:26 - but in your code you can write these
05:28 - comments next to your code
05:30 - so when you're starting out before you
05:32 - become this big bad wolf this amazing
05:35 - developer in the start
05:37 - start off by writing out what it is that
05:39 - you're trying to accomplish
05:41 - it's going to chunk things and make them
05:43 - much simpler
05:44 - a lot of the problem happens for new
05:47 - beginner developers
05:48 - is where you try to chunk up everything
05:50 - all into
05:51 - one so you think of this entire
05:54 - application
05:55 - as one thing you think of even like
05:58 - login functionality as one thing whereas
06:01 - login functionality even
06:03 - is not just one thing you need the name
06:05 - field
06:06 - you need the email field right you might
06:09 - need the
06:11 - password field so you just have to work
06:13 - on putting those
06:15 - okay so if the user can put in data well
06:18 - what do i need to do next i need to be
06:20 - able to
06:21 - not only input the user should not be
06:23 - able to
06:24 - only input data but i need to be able to
06:26 - actually retrieve this
06:29 - ah how do i retrieve this so this is
06:32 - step one
06:33 - okay got it input data retrieving
06:36 - is part two okay how do i retrieve this
06:41 - okay once they actually hit submit i can
06:43 - do
06:44 - oh i can do e target dot value or
06:47 - something and that should
06:48 - get me the either the name or the email
06:50 - or the password once they they pop it in
06:53 - okay great once i get that what do i
06:56 - need to do
06:57 - so before you even start doing all of
06:59 - this start
07:00 - writing it out so step one for example
07:04 - need to user needs to be able to
07:08 - input data
07:11 - right then we need to be able to
07:14 - retrieve the data
07:15 - then we need to be able to
07:18 - check that data against our database
07:23 - all right you can if you're a beginner
07:24 - you can even whip up with a dummy
07:25 - database
07:26 - right right check if user
07:30 - exists if exists
07:35 - then you know share sensitive
07:38 - information or take them to a sensitive
07:40 - page
07:41 - if doesn't exist
07:44 - well then what i want you to do is say
07:48 - not authorized okay
07:51 - or whoa there whatever the case may be
07:55 - okay so once you write it out like that
07:57 - and you write out your user stories or
07:59 - what your flow looks like
08:01 - boom you're in business now the coding
08:04 - part
08:05 - is really just translating this from
08:07 - english into code
08:09 - and when you translate it into code the
08:10 - most powerful genie in the world which
08:12 - is like a computer
08:14 - understands what you're saying so first
08:17 - you take it from english which is the
08:18 - language you and i understand for humans
08:20 - we want this powerful the most powerful
08:23 - genie on the planet to understand our
08:25 - language so we speak to it in javascript
08:27 - or we speak to it in python
08:30 - or c plus plus or c sharp or whatever
08:32 - java it doesn't matter
08:34 - but we switch it into programming
08:36 - language that the computer can
08:37 - understand
08:38 - that's that's effectively all you're
08:40 - trying to do
08:41 - okay which is why this pseudo code
08:45 - is so important and conceptual
08:47 - understanding of what you're trying to
08:48 - do is so important
08:50 - it will save you so much trouble and
08:54 - avoid you going down the wrong path and
08:57 - especially when you're a beginner
08:59 - you will end up going down a lot of
09:01 - wrong paths not realize that spend hours
09:03 - and hours hours and realize wait that's
09:05 - not a feature
09:06 - i needed in the first place why am even
09:07 - trying to do this oh
09:09 - huh weird so this will also keep you
09:14 - on track of what you're doing okay
09:16 - instead of because sometimes
09:18 - if you don't have this how you'll code
09:19 - is maybe you'll
09:21 - start working on inputting and you'll
09:23 - only complete the name fields and not
09:25 - the email and password field
09:27 - then maybe you'll start working on the
09:29 - logic of if the user exists
09:31 - and then you'll start working and you're
09:32 - like oh yeah if the user exists and the
09:34 - other thing i need to do is what if they
09:36 - don't exist then you'll work on this
09:37 - and they'll be like oh then oh i also
09:39 - need to be able to retrieve the data and
09:41 - you'll do this
09:42 - and it's just like messy and all over
09:45 - the place
09:45 - and then you'll realize oh i didn't put
09:47 - an email or password oh i set up my
09:49 - database
09:50 - wrong because that also doesn't ask for
09:51 - email or password oh gosh
09:54 - so you're gonna go down this whole crazy
09:55 - path whereas if you do it in a normal
09:58 - way
09:58 - then just boom boom boom boom you just
10:01 - go down all these
10:02 - right and you just finish all of them
10:05 - and this is what i said in my
10:06 - yesterday's video if you watched it
10:08 - and i said hey going slow
10:15 - is going fast in the word of a world of
10:18 - software development
10:20 - okay so this is where this is going to
10:23 - help you
10:24 - and when you write things down in
10:26 - english
10:27 - before you start writing your code you
10:29 - focus on the
10:30 - what you're trying to do you also focus
10:33 - on the
10:34 - why you're trying to do it which these
10:37 - two are
10:37 - more important what you're trying to do
10:40 - why you're trying to do it
10:42 - okay and then
10:45 - lastly we focus on the how okay
10:49 - the problem that happens is
10:52 - when you think of it all at once you
10:55 - think of it like
10:57 - what how
11:00 - why and you try to do all of this
11:04 - at once so your little human brain okay
11:07 - so what i'm gonna do
11:08 - is we're just gonna say that's your like
11:12 - brain okay and then this is the
11:15 - you human i don't know why your brain is
11:17 - like way bigger than you but that's
11:19 - just what it is so i don't care deal
11:21 - with it
11:22 - okay so that's you and that's your brain
11:25 - and your brain is going
11:26 - crazy it's like what it's just going
11:29 - from like what to how to why to how to
11:32 - what the how to how
11:33 - why how to what what to how why and it's
11:36 - just
11:36 - constantly going through that cycle
11:39 - in like this endless loop and you're not
11:42 - making forward progress by the time your
11:44 - day gets done you're just done with
11:45 - these two steps and your brain is
11:47 - hurting
11:50 - so what you actually need to do is go
11:53 - let's just do one thing at a time and
11:55 - let's separate it
11:56 - out so now i imagine
12:00 - you could either be that person with all
12:02 - of those things running through your
12:03 - head
12:04 - or you could be this other person let's
12:06 - go right here
12:09 - and you just have the what
12:15 - okay let's just go what that's the first
12:18 - thing that's in your head just
12:20 - one thing at a time what am i trying to
12:23 - do
12:24 - hmm cool this is what i'm trying to do
12:27 - got it okay
12:31 - why is this important
12:34 - okay um that's why it's important
12:38 - okay i know why i'm trying to do this i
12:40 - also know what i'm trying to do
12:42 - and then now the last part
12:45 - how how equals
12:49 - coding okay do you see
12:52 - that coding is 33 of your job okay
12:58 - that's the how how is 33
13:02 - why is 33 percent
13:06 - and you're what is 33
13:10 - all right so really coding
13:13 - is this part your how is the coding part
13:15 - so let's just write code right there
13:17 - okay that's the only time you worry
13:19 - about writing code
13:21 - so only one third of your job as a
13:24 - software developer or even less is
13:26 - actually writing code i would argue even
13:28 - a lot less
13:29 - okay that's the part you do
13:32 - at the end which is the how part and
13:34 - then you sit down
13:37 - most people are coding 90 of the time
13:39 - they're like not even thinking just
13:40 - start writing
13:41 - gibberish code and then you run into
13:44 - these
13:44 - problems and you run into these errors
13:46 - and you get frustrated and you feel like
13:48 - you're not making progress
13:49 - well it's not really your fault it's
13:52 - the fault of you not knowing the right
13:54 - way to think through
13:56 - and problem solve it's the fault of you
13:58 - not having a clear idea of what you need
14:00 - to do to succeed
14:02 - it's the fault of you not setting
14:04 - yourself up for success
14:06 - okay and or and you not knowing how to
14:08 - do that and you not being educated
14:11 - from youtube tutorials or udemy
14:12 - tutorials or boot camps or wherever
14:16 - or you know college so you need to know
14:18 - all of these things and you need to
14:20 - understand that coding is not the most
14:22 - important part of my job coding is
14:23 - something i do coding is something i
14:24 - love to do it's a lot of fun
14:26 - but i need to have my what and the house
14:29 - straight or my what in the whys
14:31 - why and the what straight and the how is
14:33 - the coding part that's what i do at the
14:35 - end that's the
14:36 - detail implementation okay those are the
14:40 - implementation details
14:41 - of it being a reality of you turning it
14:44 - into an actual thing
14:52 - all right so that's
14:55 - pretty important for you to be aware of
14:57 - for you to understand
15:00 - and once you understand that
15:03 - here's what starts to happen okay so
15:05 - let's write down the
15:06 - what the why
15:10 - and the how
15:13 - this is two-thirds of your job all right
15:17 - that means this is 66 or more
15:20 - of your job so if you work on this
15:24 - something weird happens on surface i
15:27 - don't see
15:28 - anything improving okay so let's say
15:30 - that that's the surface
15:31 - this is the tip of the iceberg okay this
15:34 - is the code or the application of yours
15:37 - that i see
15:37 - okay this is what you've produced
15:41 - now this is the thinking behind it okay
15:44 - and this
15:44 - is the why behind it and this is really
15:48 - what makes
15:48 - a great software a great software
15:50 - developer this is where
15:52 - senior developers are okay
15:56 - when you see their code or you see their
15:57 - app they're like that's pretty cool
15:59 - but 90 60 to 90 of the main
16:03 - things are happening underneath which is
16:06 - when they're thinking of the what and
16:07 - the why
16:08 - it's not necessarily how many lines of
16:10 - code that they're writing
16:12 - okay so you as somebody who's maybe
16:14 - beginning and getting better in your
16:16 - journey
16:17 - understand that that's where you get the
16:18 - biggest results
16:20 - and what that looks like is you will get
16:22 - these
16:23 - hockey stick results if you get your
16:25 - what and why
16:26 - and you're thinking clear if you get
16:28 - your thinking clear you become a killer
16:30 - in software development
16:32 - instead of other people who are like
16:34 - worried about syntax and
16:36 - new things in the framework and
16:40 - like new oh i just learned this new
16:43 - library and
16:44 - oh wow yeah this library is so cool it
16:47 - lets me
16:48 - do this one thing a lot easier okay
16:51 - great
16:53 - maybe you're but you are working on
16:55 - something that's deeper that's better
16:57 - that's more
16:58 - thought out and that sometimes you don't
17:01 - really see it right away right but this
17:03 - is where you get this
17:04 - hockey stick growth and that's the
17:05 - growth i want you to have
17:07 - i don't want this to happen to you where
17:09 - you plateau because
17:10 - somebody's just learning new frameworks
17:11 - new languages what happens like
17:13 - theoretically if they just learned every
17:15 - single language and every single thing
17:17 - their growth has like plateaued forever
17:20 - but if you're learning how to solve
17:22 - problems if you're learning how to
17:23 - actually bring value to the market if
17:25 - you're learning
17:26 - your your growth is crazy whereas these
17:30 - people
17:30 - they have good early growth and then
17:32 - distorted plateau in my opinion as
17:34 - software developers
17:35 - i know developers that have been
17:36 - developing for like 10 years and my
17:38 - skill set is better than them
17:40 - i know developers have been developing
17:42 - for 15 years and i can run circles
17:43 - around them
17:44 - and it's only because i feel like i got
17:46 - my fundamentals right
17:48 - and i got my principles right and i have
17:50 - my thinking right
17:51 - and my what i focus so much on the what
17:54 - and the why
17:54 - i'm like not religious to code at all i
17:56 - don't give a about writing code
17:58 - i love code but practically speaking if
18:01 - the solution already exists online
18:03 - i will find it and i will use that why
18:06 - so i don't have to write code
18:07 - why so i don't have to maintain code why
18:09 - so i only use my brain on the novel
18:11 - problems not on trivial problems
18:14 - that's where you're hindering your
18:16 - growth
18:17 - i'm focused on the what and the why why
18:19 - am i doing this i'm doing this for a
18:21 - customer
18:21 - i'm doing this for a client okay
18:25 - well if i'm doing this for a client then
18:27 - i want them to
18:28 - have an amazing app well if i'm about to
18:30 - make an
18:31 - app that's helpful for them do i do my
18:33 - job right yes i do
18:35 - whether i code it or if a code
18:39 - some solution exists online like a
18:41 - library
18:42 - or a framework or a repo that i could
18:45 - use and build on top of an open source
18:47 - project
18:48 - do does the client care does the company
18:51 - care they probably don't they just want
18:53 - to make sure
18:54 - hey as long as it's legal you're not
18:56 - stealing or plagiarizing code
18:58 - you're good right and they just care
19:01 - about the end result they don't want to
19:03 - pay me like for
19:04 - three months of my time to build them
19:06 - this same app from scratch they'll pay
19:08 - way more and then they'll also have to
19:10 - pay to
19:11 - for me to maintain it and when it messes
19:13 - up they're also dependent on me
19:15 - whereas with the open source way maybe i
19:17 - just built something up
19:18 - they got it up and running in a few days
19:20 - they're able to use it i'm much more
19:22 - valuable as a developer and no they
19:23 - won't
19:24 - replace me they will give me more and
19:25 - more work because they're like hey
19:26 - you're doing a great job
19:30 - what and the why people just get so
19:33 - caught up in the how they're like oh
19:34 - i got this project like i'm gonna use
19:36 - node.js for this and i'm gonna
19:39 - do this and i'm gonna use headwind ui
19:41 - and then i'm gonna use tailwind css and
19:43 - i'm gonna use aws to scale it
19:45 - horizontally and vertically and
19:47 - then i'm gonna use this cloud computing
19:49 - and then i'm gonna do this devops thing
19:51 - and oh man
19:52 - you should look at my github actions
19:53 - that i have for this workflow and
19:55 - yeah i definitely cannot forget travis
19:57 - ci and
19:58 - i have all the testing in place like i
20:00 - have the unit testing in place this is
20:01 - gonna be an awesome
20:04 - yo did you realize that a solution
20:06 - already exists and you just wasted two
20:07 - months of your time
20:09 - do you not care about your time
20:11 - energy
20:13 - effort
20:16 - you just want to sit there write code
20:17 - make a fun pretty stack
20:19 - cool i'm there to help the client and
20:21 - the customer
20:23 - so what happens i get them the results
20:25 - faster i get paid way more

21:02 - all awesome stuff it's great if you are
21:05 - serious about
21:06 - actually landing a job and mastering
21:08 - full stack development
21:10 - we just launched full stack mastery
21:12 - coding bootcamp we launched it a couple
21:14 - of months ago
21:15 - students are getting incredible results
21:16 - and i shared this yesterday with you
21:18 - guys as well
21:19 - but just in case you missed it we have
21:21 - within a span of two to three months of
21:23 - just launching this program and it's a
21:25 - six to eight month long program
21:26 - we already have three students that have
21:28 - full-time jobs
21:30 - and they're not even done with the
21:32 - program and we have a student dave
21:34 - we have on who just went from postmates
21:37 - to getting a full-time job
21:38 - a 70 000 year job we have um
21:42 - dave who just got a six-figure job which
21:45 - is absolutely incredible and then of
21:47 - course our goal is to help five thousand
21:48 - dollars
21:49 - five thousand developers get jobs
21:52 - this year whether it's through our boot
21:54 - camp or youtube
21:56 - both are exciting okay so what we want
21:59 - to do
21:59 - in this boot camp our goal is hey how
22:02 - can we take people and how can we take
22:04 - you and make sure that you learn
22:06 - the what and the why and not just the
22:09 - how how do you become a good
22:10 - software developer not just a programmer
22:14 - okay how do you learn how to think where
22:17 - you're
22:17 - getting set up your foundation is so
22:20 - strong that you're looking at this
22:21 - growth
22:22 - not the other plateau which in the start
22:25 - feels exciting that's what happens at
22:26 - other boot camps right
22:27 - you go to these other boot camps they're
22:28 - like yeah you're learning apis this week
22:31 - week two you're learning back end week
22:33 - three you're learning front end week
22:35 - four you have
22:36 - your first e-commerce app built week six
22:39 - five
22:40 - you're gonna have your restaurant app
22:42 - built
22:43 - and all that's happening you're getting
22:45 - excited excited excited excited excited
22:47 - excited
22:48 - and then you go to the real world and
22:49 - just
22:51 - your basics are you go to the
22:53 - interview they like kick you out and
22:54 - laugh you out of the room
22:56 - even when you get the job you get fired
22:58 - after four months because they just
22:59 - realize and found out that you're not a
23:01 - good software developer
23:03 - you'd rather go slow in the start so
23:06 - then you have disk growth
23:08 - and that's built on strong foundations
23:11 - and our full stack mastery boot camp
23:12 - that's what we focus on a massively
23:15 - strong
23:16 - foundation so we're going to be
23:18 - mastering data structures and algorithms
23:21 - okay the first two to three months are
23:23 - going to be the hardest
23:25 - of any boot camp or any program you've
23:27 - ever been to
23:28 - okay but we're gonna be there and make
23:31 - sure that you do well and succeed in
23:33 - this
23:34 - okay and then in our program the next
23:36 - things we focus on is of course we work
23:38 - with you
23:38 - on um we'll work with you on front-end
23:41 - development
23:42 - so this includes javascript react.js all
23:45 - of that
23:46 - we will work with html css right we'll
23:49 - work with you on back-end development
23:50 - skills
23:52 - okay so that includes things like
23:54 - firebase
23:55 - which is a real-time database mongodb
23:58 - you know nosql database
24:00 - postgres you'll learn all of this stuff
24:03 - because
24:04 - this is still needed so mysql database
24:06 - is still one of the most popular ones so
24:08 - you'll learn
24:08 - those as well and then of course at the
24:11 - end we will be focusing on helping you
24:14 - find a full-time job
24:17 - okay that's the last phase where after
24:19 - you've built these massive projects
24:21 - you move into being focused on getting
24:24 - full-time jobs and that's where we're
24:26 - gonna work with you until you land a job
24:28 - okay so in my opinion
24:32 - with all the other boot camps i've seen
24:33 - with all the other programs we've seen
24:35 - this is by far the best program out
24:38 - there in the world
24:40 - and the reason why i can say that with
24:41 - confidence is even i know from our
24:44 - youtube
24:44 - platform right just all the content we
24:46 - have out there for you
24:47 - to enjoy and we will continually keep
24:50 - putting out so whether you join us or
24:51 - not
24:52 - you're going to be getting massive value
24:54 - for free forever
24:56 - even that content has helped countless
24:59 - of people get
25:00 - jobs i recently got off a call with one
25:03 - of the people and he was like yo i was
25:04 - homeless
25:05 - and now i got a 60 000 year job as a
25:08 - software developer
25:09 - that's freaking awesome that's what
25:12 - excites me and fuels me and the team
25:14 - every single day
25:17 - and if our content on youtube can bring
25:20 - this much value or our program profit
25:22 - with javascript
25:23 - this is that but then on a whole another
25:26 - level
25:27 - because it's a six to eight month online
25:29 - boot camp
25:30 - it is completely immersive
25:34 - all right so eight month
25:38 - no and this is not like some other like
25:41 - weird
25:42 - scammy or shitty like no offense to
25:44 - other boot camps but
25:46 - how are you planning to teach people in
25:48 - three months how are you planning to
25:49 - turn somebody into a software developer
25:51 - in 12 weeks
25:52 - can one of you boot camp people please
25:54 - come on this platform and have a
25:56 - conversation with me about it because i
25:57 - don't understand
26:00 - the only way that that's happening that
26:02 - these other boot camps are getting most
26:04 - other people's jobs is most of the times
26:06 - in the 12-week type of boot camp
26:10 - what's happening is that you're taking a
26:12 - good software developer already
26:14 - taking them through the program and
26:15 - they're getting a job it's like how
26:16 - harvard takes students
26:18 - was harvard the thing that turned the
26:21 - student into a success or was that
26:22 - student have to be a pretty successful
26:24 - person intelligent person capable person
26:27 - with so many tons of resources
26:29 - beforehand that they're
26:30 - even able to get into harvard right
26:34 - chicken or the egg so with most other
26:36 - boot camps it's not complete beginners
26:39 - we take a lot of pride because we are
26:41 - working with complete beginners
26:44 - all the way to advanced people and
26:45 - helping them get jobs
26:47 - get results and get their skills up and
26:49 - master full stack development
26:52 - okay so completely online immersive
26:55 - program so you're gonna be mastering all
26:56 - of this stuff
26:57 - okay and then of course what i've told
27:00 - you already which is
27:02 - a full-time job we help you find a
27:04 - full-time job
27:05 - and some of the things that we do to do
27:07 - that is make sure
27:08 - that you have mock interviews as well as
27:10 - that you have access to
27:12 - amazing job opportunities
27:15 - okay so if these things excite you
27:19 - if this interests you what we're doing
27:21 - right now is
27:22 - we're doing a basically a 30 to 45
27:26 - minute strategy call
27:30 - and in this call what our goal is either
27:33 - me or one of my team
27:34 - members that clever programmer is gonna
27:35 - hop on a call with you and we're going
27:37 - to give you
27:38 - massive value okay our goal is to give
