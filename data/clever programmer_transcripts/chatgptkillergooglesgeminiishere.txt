00:00 - dude I'm curious like what is happening
00:02 - in the AI world and Chad GPT world right
00:05 - now cuz I know you were sharing some
00:07 - stuff on WhatsApp so like I want to
00:09 - catch up from the I want to drink from
00:11 - the horse's mouth nothing is happening
00:13 - with chat G except they have competition
00:15 - so what's going on with Gemini so talk
00:17 - to me about that Google finally released
00:19 - Gemini it's fully multimodal like they
00:22 - did a one of the videos they did as he's
00:25 - drawing the picture it's telling him
00:27 - what he's drawing really picking up
00:28 - colors like he starts outling a CLE he
00:31 - finishes up it has a bill and some we
00:33 - he's like oh but it says oh it's a duck
00:35 - now then he draws Qui on it look like
00:38 - ocean water oh it's a duck swimming in
00:40 - Ocean Ducks don't swim in the ocean
00:42 - though really and it says oh most Ducks
00:45 - aren't blue most ducks are white or
00:46 - black some of them are green some are
00:48 - rarely blue but most AR most aren't blue
00:50 - what the [ __ ] that's some scary [ __ ]
00:53 - that I don't know what oh this is this
00:55 - was released 5 hours ago yeah it's
01:00 - available yet bro I have an idea dude I
01:02 - have an idea like I'm looking at this
01:03 - I'm like whoa I want to hold on I want
01:05 - to watch this video I'm going to try
01:07 - playing this video Let's see all right
01:10 - testing Gemini here we go tell me what
01:12 - you see I see you placing a piece of
01:15 - paper on the
01:16 - table I see a squiggly line so so far
01:21 - it's um it's pretty good but this is
01:23 - something I'd seen them do with the
01:25 - drawing tool that they had made a a lot
01:27 - earlier right Doodles it was something
01:29 - called I forgot exactly what it was
01:30 - called but it did that so I am they had
01:33 - doodle they had Doodles in um um stable
01:35 - diffusion they had Doodles with chat gbt
01:38 - built in but just make Doodles and then
01:40 - go look yep all right let me keep going
01:42 - through and let's see what happens I see
01:43 - a squiggly line okay what about now the
01:47 - contour lines are smooth and flowing
01:49 - with no sharp angles or Jagged edges
01:51 - holy [ __ ] okay that's that's pretty cool
01:57 - okay it looks like a bird to me hm what
02:00 - if I add
02:01 - this the bird is swimming in the water
02:05 - whoa water dude that's cool it's all
02:09 - water yeah like what how does it okay
02:12 - that's cool it has a long neck and Beak
02:15 - it is a duck yes like that's not a duck
02:18 - first of all that's not a duck but
02:19 - that's the closest thing to a duck
02:20 - that's the closest thing to a duck and
02:21 - you know his drawing is maybe also not
02:23 - the best but like what I'm thinking is
02:25 - holy [ __ ] AI is beginning to see that is
02:30 - scary and exciting at the same time it's
02:33 - not just looking at one pixel at a time
02:35 - and seeing if they match up on what's
02:36 - next in the next pixel it's let me
02:38 - seeing a picture yeah yeah [ __ ] dude oh
02:41 - my God okay I'm want to keep watching
02:43 - Duck is a type of waterf in the Family
02:45 - inat Day ducks are closely related to
02:48 - geese and swans the duck appears to be
02:50 - blue this is not a common color for
02:53 - ducks however there are some breeds of
02:55 - blue ducks these are
02:57 - wao that was sick
03:00 - it knew that there are different it knew
03:03 - that was rare and it knew that there are
03:05 - different breeds that have blue that is
03:07 - so cool I'm just trying to think like it
03:10 - could be watching over you and it could
03:12 - be like huh the way that you're coding
03:14 - this app it's not the normal way I would
03:17 - do this but you could still do it this
03:19 - way and it's like it can even have code
03:21 - smells and tell you about them and
03:23 - detect you know anomalies like like a
03:25 - real person would typically not as
03:28 - common as other duck breeds it is more
03:30 - common for ducks to be brown black or
03:32 - white are you sure what the quack I was
03:36 - just talking about a Blue Duck and now
03:38 - you're holding one it looks like blue
03:40 - ducks are more common than I thought it
03:42 - knew the difference between drawing and
03:45 - holding that yeah it's in his hands
03:48 - y would this float I'm not sure what
03:52 - material it's made of but it looks like
03:54 - it might be rubber or plastic what if I
03:56 - tell you it's making a squeaking sound
03:58 - oh if it's squeaking it's definitely
04:00 - going to float nice it is a rubber duck
04:03 - it is made of a material that is less
04:05 - dense than water can you teach me how to
04:07 - say I'm surprised by how fast it is in
04:10 - its responses because when you do the
04:12 - voice chat with Chad GPT Chad GPT kind
04:15 - of takes its time it converts it and
04:18 - then right I think this has to be
04:20 - shortened it has to be oh you're
04:21 - thinking like they edited the video
04:23 - right it has there's no way it could be
04:25 - that fast yeah that's what I'm thinking
04:26 - too but I mean dude we we didn't think
04:29 - there was a way AI like this could ever
04:31 - exist and now that exists so I believe
04:34 - anything at this point is possible let's
04:36 - keep going is this in a different
04:38 - language and give me a few options ooh
04:41 - can you explain how to pronounce the
04:42 - Mandarin one is it yeah it's a y is
04:46 - pronounced with a first tone in Mandarin
04:49 - there are
04:50 - four it can play like different sounds
04:54 - like that too bro what is going on
04:57 - that's what's taking them so long they
04:58 - want it to be in every language that
05:00 - they could possibly get it there not
05:02 - just English man if I was Chad GPT I'd
05:04 - be like cashing the checks and storing
05:08 - it away in like a Wyoming LLC before the
05:11 - competition comes to
05:14 - [ __ ] they're gonna have to step up on
05:16 - this if they're gonna I'm excited
05:18 - because yeah right now they have no
05:19 - competitor because like Google bard is
05:21 - the worst thing I've ever seen in my
05:23 - life it was pretty bad yeah Google board
05:25 - is like something I cated up with if
05:27 - then
05:28 - statements
05:30 - tones which are essential to distinguish
05:32 - the meaning of words the first tone is a
05:34 - high level tone Oh
05:37 - okay the duck is in the middle of the
05:39 - ocean there is no land nearby for the
05:42 - duck to rest or find food it is unlikely
05:45 - to find Ducks here naturally oh my God
05:48 - like it could oh it gets better okay
05:52 - based on what you see come up with a
05:53 - game idea oh and use emojis please how
05:57 - about this we can play a game called
05:59 - guess the
06:02 - country what that is amazing I could be
06:05 - like okay based on this come up with
06:08 - content ideas come up with this and it's
06:10 - like coming up with stuff let's do it
06:14 - clue one this country is the home of the
06:16 - kangaroo the koala and the Great Barrier
06:18 - Reef oh that's easy this dude's just
06:21 - going to whoa he answered it with just
06:25 - his finger dude just his he points to it
06:28 - and you oh my God like imagine if you're
06:32 - trying to book a trip someplace and you
06:33 - just I want to go here on this date I
06:36 - just want to go here that is amazing me
06:39 - there what's the average price of a
06:40 - ticket that basically means like I can I
06:42 - can be looking at a picture in
06:43 - Switzerland imagine my screen is being
06:46 - shared 24/7 right so it's like watching
06:48 - my screen the whole time so like I go on
06:51 - Google Images I type in Switzerland I
06:52 - see like this beautiful place and I'm
06:54 - just like um book a trip to here and
06:57 - then it just figures everything out
06:59 - books a trip and then like gets me to
07:01 - that specific location in Switzerland
07:04 - yep and it's going to be able to do it
07:05 - because they have three different size
07:06 - models and the smallest one can live
07:08 - locally on your phone they said smallest
07:10 - one can live on your phone imagine if
07:13 - it's on your phone and it's looking at
07:14 - your screen it can and you you tell it
07:17 - you just point where you want to go and
07:19 - it just runs through all the apps and
07:21 - does it all for you dude it can like
07:23 - text for me it can see my messages it
07:26 - can freaking email people it can hand
07:29 - handle like so much [ __ ] like I could
07:31 - leave it open and it could just go
07:33 - through my iPhone messaging people back
07:35 - based on how I message cuz it knows that
07:37 - already and it could take action on it
07:39 - I'm just trying to think the
07:40 - applications of it are kind of like
07:42 - infinite but what's what's crazy is that
07:45 - it's so new that my brain doesn't even
07:47 - know how to think of it yet like I need
07:49 - to see examples of where more places I
07:51 - could use it but those are some of the
07:53 - spots that are coming to me I mean I bet
07:56 - I could do this too right like imagine
07:57 - interior designers what's going to
07:59 - happened to their job so it's like I
08:00 - just showcase where I'm at you know I
08:03 - just point it to like my apartment and I
08:06 - just show the camera in my apartment and
08:07 - I just go order me stuff like I need a
08:11 - desk and I need a couch and because it
08:13 - can see it can figure out everything
08:16 - about it will this match the paint color
08:18 - in there is it going to contrast or
08:19 - something like that and it'll just tell
08:21 - you my god dude this is so great you get
08:24 - a new girlfriend you're like will my mom
08:26 - approve of her it has the whole
08:30 - let's keep going I dude this is [ __ ]
08:32 - exciting loves football and has won the
08:34 - most brail I don't know I could be
08:37 - history
08:40 - H
08:43 - wow you were trying to get me to find
08:45 - the
08:46 - paper you can play games with it so dude
08:49 - all I'm imagining is like at this point
08:51 - we're [ __ ] ready dude we're [ __ ]
08:53 - ready for a physical robot that's in
08:56 - your house these servers with [ __ ] that
08:58 - robot has the processing power to handle
09:01 - this right like [ __ ] these shitty
09:03 - servers with bad attitudes I mean if
09:05 - you're a good server I love you but but
09:08 - like you know Screw all that you have
09:10 - these robots they can like literally
09:12 - play games with you dude mhm that is so
09:15 - cool because if it can see this it means
09:18 - it can see a Punch coming towards it and
09:20 - move out of the way it
09:22 - can uh drive for you which we've already
09:26 - we're already doing like that that one
09:28 - is proven I mean I don't know I it could
09:30 - be like instead of having a videographer
09:33 - I could have that robot moving around
09:35 - the camera inside my house and following
09:37 - me around I could be a little drone too
09:40 - because it'll fly anywhere it'll just
09:41 - know to follow I need you to follow me
09:43 - all the while stay three4 behind me all
09:46 - oh my God imagine the Drone imagine the
09:48 - Drone that follows you and I feed it my
09:51 - type of coaching that I do for content
09:53 - for people like basically so it's like
09:55 - imagine the Drone is following you has
09:57 - the camera and it's talking to you and
09:59 - it's just like hey what if we make
10:01 - content on this you know Mike what do
10:03 - you think about Gemini and then you
10:04 - start talking and it's like shooting
10:06 - content coaching you through it and then
10:08 - it could send all that to another
10:10 - assistant that does does all
10:13 - the let's go pulls into audio you like
10:16 - pulls into the stock footage puts the
10:18 - text in there oh dude humans are done
10:22 - dude I am excited humans I mean no not I
10:25 - don't mean humans are done here's what I
10:27 - mean I mean like our lives are about to
10:29 - upgrade by like [ __ ] 500 times in the
10:34 - next two to 5 years we're going to be
10:37 - like everybody's going to be living like
10:39 - 10 times the lifestyle of a king back in
10:41 - the day that's what I'm thinking it's
10:43 - going to be it's going to be wild
10:44 - depending on what this is how they apply
10:46 - this it's going to be wild to me it
10:48 - tells me it's the time to be learning
10:50 - about this stuff and building with this
10:51 - like yes under the cup I accept the
10:57 - challenge the cup to to the left the
10:59 - stupid thing gets it right I'm so
11:02 - mad it was the speed in which you move
11:05 - it around doesn't seem to matter they're
11:07 - all the same color they're all the same
11:09 - shape you're right they're the same
11:10 - color they're the same shape they're the
11:12 - same size and he moved them around so
11:14 - fast and it was able to oh my God so
11:17 - it's not just taking pictures it's like
11:21 - act factually watching because if it was
11:24 - just taking pictures it would be like it
11:26 - wouldn't I mean I know it like you take
11:29 - enough pictures in you [ __ ] video I
11:30 - know but like you know what I mean right
11:33 - it's like it's like a fullon video type
11:35 - of watching I accept the challenge
11:37 - there's not enough differences in
11:38 - lighting and texture to see that there's
11:40 - a difference
11:41 - yes I didn't even follow where the
11:44 - freaking thing was dude okay here we go
11:45 - rock paper scissors
11:50 - nice whoa I know what you're doing
11:53 - you're playing rock paper
11:55 - scissors bro sign language start signing
11:59 - now you're going to be able to talk to
12:00 - people sign language anywhere oh my god
12:04 - dude yeah it just knew with sign
12:06 - language what you were doing if you're
12:08 - in an emergency you could just make a
12:10 - [ __ ] sign over the finger and it
12:12 - could call the police at your behalf you
12:15 - know like imagine just having this
12:17 - camera in your house like a surveillance
12:19 - camera and it's watching everything in
12:21 - the house and like if there's an
12:23 - emergency you could you know if it sees
12:24 - you fall down bro and you get hurt it
12:27 - could call for help but I'm just
12:28 - thinking about it you know I'm like in
12:29 - the house and I'm like oh [ __ ] I'm
12:31 - [ __ ] starving and it just sees me and
12:34 - hears me and it's just like all right
12:36 - instacart is on the way exactly I feel
12:39 - like a burger it knows what you like
12:40 - already that's how I am with my
12:42 - assistant right now but it would be
12:43 - really cool to even have it just with an
12:45 - AI That's like living with me that's
12:47 - exactly what it's going to do like
12:48 - imagine you're here and you're on your
12:51 - computer right and it's like hey Cy you
12:53 - look a little tired right now I
12:54 - recommend like you go get a workout in
12:57 - and we get your energy up before content
12:59 - and I'm like oh my God you're right I go
13:01 - hit the workout and come back and all of
13:03 - a sudden I crush the content session you
13:05 - know and same thing with like somebody
13:06 - who's coding you know or somebody's
13:08 - doing whatever it's like hey I think you
13:09 - should do this what do you see now the
13:11 - fingers are spread out to look like the
13:13 - wings of a butterfly what's this big ear
13:16 - and barking mouth sweet oh wow the coin
13:21 - should be under the right hand I don't
13:23 - know the coin is in the left hand using
13:26 - a slight of hand technique to make it
13:28 - appear as if the coin has now it knows
13:30 - magic what the it knows you did Magic
13:32 - disappear knew
13:35 - magic it knows magic Making Connections
13:38 - okay let's see objects are round and
13:40 - flat there you
13:41 - go both are food the Orange is a
13:44 - healthier choice than the cookie
13:49 - wow citrus can be calming and so can the
13:52 - spin of the fidget to what the [ __ ]
13:55 - those are crazy connections to be making
13:57 - they are both examples of popular toys
13:59 - that have been enjoyed by children and
14:01 - adults alike for many years this was
14:04 - wild make with this I see pink and green
14:07 - yarn like Chad GPT is in its infancy
14:09 - stages of this where Chad GPT I send
14:12 - screenshots to it like I haven't done
14:14 - laundry in [ __ ] years you know I have
14:16 - a cleaning uh crew that always comes and
14:19 - do that does that but I was doing my
14:21 - laundry the other day and I literally
14:23 - took a photo of the laundry machine and
14:26 - I just put it at the CH GPT and I was
14:28 - like just give me all the default
14:30 - settings I need to do and it was like
14:33 - it's like pick cold for soil pick medium
14:35 - for this do this do this and I'm like
14:37 - why the [ __ ] are first of all laundry
14:38 - machines so complicated with like 500
14:40 - buttons If I had a laundry machine I
14:42 - would just had the button
14:43 - start that's exactly what this will do
14:46 - it'll know what color clothes you have
14:47 - in there how much
14:49 - is material it is it would already know
14:51 - all that and it that's genius and so the
14:53 - laundry machine has no buttons it has
14:55 - nothing you just open it up you throw
14:57 - everything in there you close it and it
14:59 - does everything minus the [ __ ]
15:01 - detergent yeah it'll tell you when you
15:03 - have one piece of delicates in there
15:04 - that doesn't belong with the rest of the
15:05 - load and take it out that's great which
15:08 - where should the Duck Go going left
15:10 - leads to a duck which is a friend going
15:12 - right leads to a bear which is a foe it
15:15 - is better if you have this guy giving
15:17 - you advice no horror movie will be ever
15:21 - made except when he gets mad at you for
15:24 - something for not plugging in
15:26 - oring tells you to go to
15:29 - that would be a premise for a phenomenal
15:32 - horror movie but dude this was so much
15:34 - fun if you're open to it bro I would
15:35 - love to do more of this sure much love
15:38 - peace bye
