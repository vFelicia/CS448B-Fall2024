00:00 - yo what is up daniel from
00:01 - cleverprogrammer here now you probably
00:03 - haven't seen my face around too much and
00:05 - that's because i've been working behind
00:07 - the scenes
00:07 - with clever programmer but today i want
00:10 - to dive into
00:11 - how you could leverage your skills as a
00:13 - software developer
00:14 - to make money in 2021 now we all know
00:16 - that 2020
00:18 - was just a crazy and interesting year
00:20 - especially for software development
00:22 - so many roles went remote especially in
00:24 - big tech companies like google
00:26 - microsoft and amazon so i want to show
00:29 - you five different ways to leverage that
00:31 - and make money in 2021 as a software
00:33 - developer now before we jump into it i
00:35 - do want to say
00:36 - that we've created this amazing training
00:39 - for you
00:39 - in this training we're going to teach
00:41 - you how to be a full stack developer
00:43 - leveraging javascript and not only that
00:46 - you're also going to learn how nas was
00:47 - able to make over 300 000
00:50 - in three years so click the link below
00:52 - and sign up for it
00:53 - now let's talk about money right before
00:56 - we dive into teaching you how to make
00:57 - money
00:58 - go ahead and smash that like button so
01:00 - that we could share this with other
01:01 - developers out there
01:03 - also don't forget to subscribe and hit
01:04 - the bell notification icon
01:06 - so that you can get alerts the minute
01:08 - that we drop a fire video like this one
01:10 - so let's get into it for these top five
01:12 - ways they can make money in 2021
01:14 - i actually categorize them and how i
01:16 - think you can do it from
01:17 - the easiest level to the hardest level
01:20 - so first i want to start with
01:21 - tutoring so tutoring is something that
01:24 - you can personally start to do
01:26 - and start to make money even if you're
01:28 - barely learning
01:29 - the beginning steps of programming even
01:32 - if you're still
01:32 - barely learning the fundamentals of
01:34 - programming so let me explain
01:36 - how that actually works if you recently
01:39 - started to learn
01:40 - how to program that means that you're
01:41 - just several steps ahead
01:43 - of someone who has zero to no experience
01:46 - programming
01:47 - so you just learned the first couple
01:49 - things off the bat
01:50 - that you can go ahead go online and
01:53 - teach someone else how to do it
01:55 - and they would be able to pay you money
01:57 - to be able to learn
01:58 - what you just learned you could leverage
02:00 - websites such as wise and or people per
02:02 - hour to be able to set up a profile
02:04 - so people can hire you to teach them and
02:07 - tutor them
02:08 - with coding and besides making money
02:10 - while teaching people
02:11 - you're also going to be solidifying your
02:14 - own learning process because now you
02:16 - have to learn things so well
02:17 - that you're able to teach them number
02:20 - two
02:20 - freelancing with freelancing there's
02:23 - different ways that you can approach
02:24 - this
02:25 - but essentially you're able to use your
02:28 - technical skill set to be able to
02:29 - provide someone
02:30 - a software that they can leverage for
02:33 - their own business or for their own
02:34 - personal use
02:36 - simply put someone pays you to develop
02:38 - an application for them
02:40 - someone pays you to code something up
02:42 - for them
02:43 - now the amazing thing about freelancing
02:45 - is it can be as profitable
02:46 - as you want to make it you can go full
02:49 - time into this
02:50 - and make more than the regular software
02:52 - engineer at a big tech company
02:54 - or you could do this part time if you
02:56 - want to take some time to enjoy your
02:57 - life
02:58 - and then just make enough income to pay
03:00 - plus have the surplus for fun things
03:02 - so the cool thing about freelancing is
03:05 - it is 100
03:06 - correlated with your skill level so if
03:09 - you get
03:10 - really good and you start to master
03:12 - something such as javascript
03:13 - at that point you have no cap on how
03:16 - much you can earn
03:16 - plus you also kind of get to work on
03:18 - your own time which is fun for everyone
03:20 - so a couple platforms you could leverage
03:22 - here would be upwork
03:23 - freelancer.net fiverr but you could get
03:26 - again on these platforms
03:27 - create your own profile and people can
03:30 - hire you so that you can develop
03:31 - software for them
03:32 - today's sponsor is hostinger and the
03:35 - reason
03:35 - why we decided to partner up with
03:37 - hostinger is because if you really
03:39 - want to start to generate money and make

05:08 - very quickly very easily and very
05:10 - effortlessly number three
05:13 - getting a software developer job now
05:15 - this was probably the one
05:16 - you're most familiar with because this
05:18 - is the standard way of being able to
05:21 - actually trade
05:22 - your skill for money and that is going
05:24 - out there
05:25 - finding a company whether it's big tech
05:27 - a small startup that wants to use your
05:29 - skills as developer and hire you to help
05:31 - them fulfill the need
05:32 - now very similar to the freelancing one
05:35 - if you do
05:36 - increase your skill set if you do become
05:38 - a master of your craft
05:40 - you're gonna be able to increase the
05:42 - salary that a job can pay you
05:44 - for example if you're just applying for
05:45 - entry level because you're barely
05:47 - getting started
05:48 - with programming then you're gonna get
05:50 - an entry level offer
05:51 - but after a couple years of mastery and
05:53 - perfecting your technique
05:55 - you can start as a level two level three
05:57 - a staff or senior depending
05:59 - what they are looking for but to sum
06:01 - that up the more skilled you are
06:04 - the more you get paid at your job so i
06:06 - personally went this route and it was a
06:08 - great stepping stone because i was able
06:09 - to get my foot into the door into the
06:11 - software development world
06:12 - along with that i was able to network
06:14 - with the amazing people that worked at
06:15 - the company
06:16 - i was able to learn from them they
06:17 - literally became my mentors
06:19 - and i was able to just build my skill
06:20 - set while getting paid
06:22 - now if you're out there looking for that
06:24 - job there is plenty of things you could
06:26 - do
06:26 - looking from job boards like indeed.com
06:28 - to even perfecting your linkedin so you
06:30 - could get
06:31 - every recruiter's attention number four
06:34 - you can
06:34 - actually start to build your own
06:37 - applications and websites
06:39 - and monetize them so a whole billion
06:41 - dollar industry of sas
06:43 - software as a service has literally been
06:46 - created
06:47 - from this people are going out there and
06:49 - they're developing a software product
06:51 - that can solve a pain point for a
06:52 - personal problem
06:53 - or a business problem and they're
06:55 - selling the software to end consumers
06:57 - you can go in there and especially
06:59 - leveraging tools like javascript
07:01 - you could build out an application that
07:03 - could be a plugin a full stack
07:04 - application whatever that may be
07:06 - that a company is willing to pay monthly
07:08 - or even a one-time payment for think
07:10 - calendly mailchimp basically any
07:13 - software
07:14 - or any mobile application that is on
07:16 - your phone
07:17 - you can develop the skill set to develop
07:19 - the same type of applications
07:21 - and monetize them the only cap here is
07:24 - now
07:24 - just your imagination if you're able to
07:26 - pick a huge
07:27 - pain point in the industry and you're
07:29 - able to create software that can solve
07:30 - it you can make a
07:32 - ton of money number five becoming a
07:34 - mentor in code mentor
07:36 - now i had mentioned i'd rate these from
07:38 - what i think is the most beginner to the
07:39 - most
07:40 - experienced so if you get on code mentor
07:43 - you can definitely start to give other
07:45 - people help but
07:46 - especially if you've been in the
07:47 - industry for a while maybe you're a
07:49 - level three or
07:50 - senior software developer you can spend
07:53 - your extra time
07:54 - mentoring other developers around the
07:56 - world and they're willing to pay
07:58 - for your time so not only do you get to
08:00 - create a side income from that
08:02 - but it's also very fulfilling because
08:03 - you're going to help other software
08:05 - developers throughout their career
08:07 - to get to places that you've been to to
08:10 - learn from your mistakes
08:11 - or you can even help them solve
08:12 - technical challenges that they might be
08:14 - currently having
08:15 - this is very similar to being like a
08:17 - consultant
08:18 - someone hires you so that you can help
08:20 - them out with their specific problems
08:22 - whether it's with their career path or
08:24 - any technical problems that they have
08:25 - and you're able to give them the right
08:27 - guidance
08:27 - and the right support that they need to
08:29 - be able to solve the specific problems
08:31 - that they're having now lucky for you
08:32 - i'm giving you
08:33 - one more as a bonus and this is number
08:36 - six
08:36 - and that is becoming a content creator
08:39 - especially in 2021
08:41 - as we've seen how viral content can go
08:43 - with tick tock
08:45 - you too can become a content creator on
08:47 - any platform that you want it could be
08:49 - tick-tock it could be youtube it could
08:50 - be instagram
08:51 - but by going out there and producing
08:53 - content that actually brings
08:54 - value to people you can then later
08:57 - monetize that
08:58 - through advertisements or through
09:00 - creating your own courses or your own
09:02 - info products now this ends up being a
09:04 - upward spiral
09:06 - of awesomeness because not only are you
09:07 - impacting people by giving them more
09:09 - support and more help through your
09:11 - product where you can also make
09:12 - a lot of money we've seen a few channels
