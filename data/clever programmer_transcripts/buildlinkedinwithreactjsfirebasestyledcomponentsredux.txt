03:51 - from absolute scratch and what that
03:54 - means is we're going to start from our
03:55 - command line okay so let's go ahead and
03:57 - clear out everything on my command line
03:59 - I'll make my screen just a little bit
04:01 - bigger here and um let's just go here
04:04 - and do a couple of things okay so I'm
04:05 - just going to go into my GitHub folder
04:07 - you can go wherever you want okay and um
04:09 - I'm going to do npx create this is the
04:12 - important command for you to follow uh
04:13 - LinkedIn clone oh it's complaining what
04:17 - is it complaining about okay so let's go
04:19 - ahead in the start and let's try doing
04:21 - pseudo npx let's see if it's a complaint
04:24 - about this no it's not okay so the
04:26 - complaint is that we need a new new
04:30 - version that right new minor version
04:32 - available okay so they want us to
04:34 - install the new version so let's just
04:35 - take that command you might actually
04:37 - need to do this as well and now it's
04:39 - complaining so let's do pseudo okay
04:41 - actually let's do this okay I'm just
04:43 - going to do create react app okay for
04:46 - you npx probably works for me sometimes
04:48 - on this computer I have to do create
04:50 - react app for whatever reason and I'm
04:52 - just going to do Linked In clone like so
04:55 - and let's hit enter and let's see what
04:56 - happens beautiful let's installing
04:59 - hopefully it's installing for you as
05:00 - well beautiful okay let's wait for it to
05:03 - finish all right great we have the
05:06 - entire app pretty much installed uh
05:08 - ready to get started the create react
05:10 - app adds in a lot of useful things that
05:13 - we need that's why this is important and
05:15 - once this is done we are actually ready
05:17 - to go ahead and get started now what I
05:19 - recommend we do is let's open up visual
05:21 - studio code okay and I'll bring that
05:23 - over here and inside of our Visual
05:26 - Studio code okay we're going to do this
05:28 - okay I'm going to open let's go I'm
05:29 - going to go to my GitHub I'm going to go
05:31 - to my Banger projects here's my LinkedIn
05:33 - clone I'm just going to open that uh bad
05:35 - boy up and we're pretty much right at
05:38 - the start okay so let me open up my
05:40 - command line and let's go into our appjs
05:43 - this is what you should have okay now
05:44 - I'm going to do yarn start and that will
05:47 - actually in uh start my development
05:49 - server and let's go here and start it
05:51 - boom this is what we should be seeing
05:54 - right about now okay awesome one note
05:56 - for you by the way if you're watching
05:58 - this um if when I do yarn start you can
06:01 - do npm start okay so for example if you
06:03 - don't have yarn just do npm start okay
06:06 - otherwise you'll have to install yarn
06:07 - and I'm pretty sure it's something like
06:09 - this and you could actually install yarn
06:11 - uh but you know if you don't want to get
06:12 - fancy just do npm start and you should
06:14 - be good I just um I just like to do yarn
06:17 - I'm just used to it now okay so your
06:19 - Local Host 3000 is open uh you should be
06:21 - good to go now we're going to do a
06:22 - couple of things we're going to delete
06:24 - unnecessary files okay so for example
06:26 - setup test I don't really need it report
06:29 - this one logo SVG uh not going to need
06:32 - that um not going to need ab. test.js so
06:35 - I'm holding command and I'm just
06:37 - clicking each one of these okay and now
06:39 - I'm just going to delete them so they're
06:41 - all gone okay uh next up what I'm going
06:43 - to do is actually pretty much every line
06:46 - inside of my index I'm going to just
06:48 - remove don't need it okay so let's just
06:50 - go like that and get rid of that okay
06:52 - cool that's good good let's go to app
06:54 - CSS and uh inside of app CSS I also
06:57 - don't really want anything so I'm just
06:59 - going to hit command a to select
07:01 - everything and I'm going to hit delete
07:03 - okay and I'm going to hit save so now
07:05 - all of that should be gone as well and
07:08 - now in appjs now here's what's going to
07:10 - happen Okay so on the right hand side
07:11 - when I hit refresh you should see this
07:12 - error your error will be like something
07:14 - something something logo SVG complaining
07:17 - about it well it makes sense why it's
07:18 - complaining about it because you just
07:19 - removed the logo silly all right so now
07:22 - in our appjs we're going to go and that
07:24 - import line at the top where we're look
07:26 - we're not importing the logo anymore so
07:28 - now we're just is going to go ahead and
07:30 - remove that line okay so I'm going to
07:33 - delete that line right there and um also
07:36 - there's a bunch of stuff in this file
07:37 - that we don't need anymore so for
07:39 - example everything inside of this uh div
07:42 - right here I can just get rid of and
07:44 - instead I'll just say let's build the
07:46 - Linked In clone like that okay and on
07:50 - the right hand side now it's complaining
07:52 - about report web vitals okay that's
07:56 - simple just go to index.js and remove
07:58 - this line there remove this line there
08:00 - where we're importing hit save wait for
08:03 - it to stop complaining
08:06 - and hey making some progress that's what
08:10 - you should be seeing right now okay so
08:12 - great job so far by the way okay
08:14 - beautiful so we got rid of all of the
08:16 - fancy styling or anything like that we
08:18 - want to pretty much start this app as
08:22 - barebone as humanly possible okay and
08:25 - kind of go from there so now what I'm
08:26 - going to do is we're just going to kind
08:28 - of set like LinkedIn type of styling
08:31 - okay so first things first I'm actually
08:33 - going to take the LinkedIn image all
08:36 - right and again I'm going to drop these
08:37 - images for you guys in the link okay so
08:40 - you can grab the LinkedIn uh image from
08:43 - from this file here okay or you can just
08:45 - go online and find a LinkedIn image so
08:49 - I'm going to go and um you know I'm
08:51 - going to grab this LinkedIn image okay
08:54 - and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
08:56 - put it in my images uh public folder and
08:58 - I'm going to create a new folder in here
09:00 - and I'm I'm going to call this images so
09:03 - inside of your public create a new
09:05 - folder called images cool and inside of
09:08 - there I'm going to put my linkedin.png
09:11 - and again if you want to find the
09:14 - LinkedIn PNG very simple just go online
09:17 - type in LinkedIn PNG and you know again
09:20 - you can use the one I gave you or just
09:24 - find one from online okay all right so
09:27 - now what we're going to do is now that
09:29 - we have the image okay I'm going to go
09:31 - inside of my um let's go inside of my
09:35 - index.html okay um and that's also
09:39 - inside of public you have
09:41 - index.html and we're just going to make
09:43 - a couple of changes to that all right so
09:46 - where it says public URL it says favicon
09:49 - uh blah blah blah we're going to replace
09:52 - all of that and remove that and replace
09:55 - it with Images slash the image that we
09:58 - just added
10:00 - LinkedIn
10:01 - linkedin.png
10:03 - okay and hit save now at the top of your
10:07 - app you should actually see the LinkedIn
10:10 - logo as your favicon okay do you see it
10:14 - beautiful okay nice and uh so that's
10:17 - good to go okay now we're going to go
10:20 - down and uh let's go where do I want to
10:24 - um add the rest of this okay so let's go
10:26 - ahead and see where it says Apple touch
10:28 - icon
10:29 - and here instead of this logo we're
10:32 - going to replace this logo here with the
10:34 - same logo so let's do images SL link and
10:38 - PNG just like that okay great so we're
10:41 - making good progress so far now let's go
10:43 - inside of our index uh index. CSS okay
10:48 - so that file is going to be inside of
10:51 - your Source directory so go inside of
10:54 - that okay index. CSS now we're going to
10:57 - add in a su styling
10:59 - okay and this is going to be the common
11:01 - styling that we're going to be using for
11:02 - LinkedIn so I just decided to Splat all
11:05 - of that kind of in the start all right
11:07 - we're going to start with making sure
11:09 - the Overflow Y is scroll okay so
11:13 - basically if we're scrolling up and down
11:15 - I want to see the scroll bar on the
11:17 - right hand side so that's what that's
11:19 - going to do and now I'm going to do
11:20 - overflow X and we're going to do hidden
11:24 - okay and what this is going to ensure
11:26 - also remember to put semicolons and also
11:28 - remember to keep HD command s or contrs
11:30 - and saving okay and overflow x hidden is
11:33 - what it's going to do is if we're
11:34 - scrolling horizontally we're not going
11:36 - to see any bars on the bottom okay
11:39 - that's what this is going to do cool and
11:41 - now let's just do a couple of things um
11:44 - to root to our body to our HTML we're
11:47 - going to add in a background color of
11:51 - the following F5 F5 F5 okay this is a
11:55 - white color the kind of color that kind
11:57 - of LinkedIn uses okay okay that's uh
12:00 - that's what this is going to do okay
12:03 - let's also add box sizing and I will
12:06 - just do border box here border box all
12:11 - right so that's good that's that makes
12:14 - it easier for us to like design our app
12:17 - okay and make sure that things fit kind
12:19 - of like how we want them to and it
12:21 - doesn't do anything weird Okay um next
12:25 - up we're going to do a couple of things
12:27 - all right so now I'm going to basically
12:29 - add some styling to things like H1 H2
12:32 - blah blah blah I'm going to just reset
12:33 - their styling so they behave in the way
12:35 - that I want them to okay so um let's
12:39 - grab our div let's grab H1 H2 H3 H4 H5
12:45 - H6 so all basically H Tags I'm going to
12:48 - also throw in header in there I'm going
12:50 - to throw in
12:51 - HTML um this tag here I'll throw in an
12:55 - image tag let's throw in label these are
12:57 - all things that we're going to need
13:00 - later okay my bullet points
13:03 - Li nav P tag let's throw in small tag as
13:08 - well span and unorder list okay that's
13:11 - it I promise okay I know it's looks
13:13 - freaking crazy looks stupid but I
13:16 - promise that's it okay now we're going
13:20 - to do a couple of things to it so margin
13:22 - we're going to make it zero okay that's
13:24 - uh first things first so already you you
13:27 - saw your headline go above okay cuz I
13:30 - removed the margin so I'm resetting the
13:32 - settings on here uh padding I'm going to
13:35 - set to zero as well okay we're going to
13:38 - go and set border to zero of all of
13:41 - theirs cool outline we'll just set it to
13:46 - none okay and then um font size I'll do
13:50 - 100% on these nice okay let's throw in a
13:56 - vertical align on this bad boy and we'll
13:58 - do
14:00 - Baseline okay and background let's do
14:03 - transparent cool so you shouldn't see
14:06 - too many changes happening right now but
14:09 - what this is doing is setting us up for
14:11 - Success kind of like if your parents
14:12 - were investing into like a 401k or your
14:16 - college uh funds that were setting you
14:18 - up for Success even though when you were
14:20 - born you had no idea what they were
14:21 - doing okay you're like that just buy me
14:23 - candy with that money okay what are you
14:25 - doing all right I hope you're making
14:27 - good progress so far okay now uh we're
14:30 - going to do a couple of things guys so
14:32 - what I want to do now is first of all I
14:34 - want to focus
14:38 - myself okay good now what I'm going to
14:41 - do on top of that is uh let's start
14:43 - working on some of our components like
14:45 - our login component okay so login
14:49 - component is going to be our component
14:51 - after I sign out at the app so if I sign
14:53 - out it's going to be our log login page
14:55 - okay so let's work on that so first
14:57 - things first I'm going to install a
15:00 - couple of things that I'm going to need
15:01 - okay so I'm going to need let me just
15:03 - open up another terminal thing here by
15:05 - hitting that button over there okay and
15:08 - um actually actually you know what I
15:11 - won't do that let me close that terminal
15:13 - just so you can see things
15:15 - clearly and um we exit out of this and
15:19 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to do
15:21 - uh yarn ad but you can also do npm
15:24 - install okay either one is fine I just
15:27 - like yarn better so whenever I do yarn
15:30 - ad you do npm install yarn ad npm
15:34 - install okay so I'm going to do yarn ad
15:37 - uh react router Dom cuz I want to use
15:41 - react routers okay so that's the first
15:44 - thing that I need to install the second
15:46 - thing I'm going to actually need to
15:47 - install is um styled components because
15:50 - guess what we're going to be using
15:51 - styled components in this beautiful
15:54 - beautiful beautiful beautiful okay so we
15:58 - pretty much got what we're looking for
16:00 - all right we we got what we're looking
16:01 - for those are the two things we're
16:02 - looking to install and now we're going
16:05 - to go inside of our
16:07 - appjs okay um actually you know what
16:09 - let's build out our component first so
16:11 - let's go inside of our source let's add
16:13 - a new folder and it'll be called
16:15 - components like that inside of our
16:18 - components folder I'm going to create a
16:19 - new file and it'll be called
16:22 - login.js okay and uh in our log injs
16:26 - file we'll just start off with import
16:28 - styled from styled components like
16:32 - so and then let's um add in the actual
16:37 - component okay so let's capitalize the
16:40 - name and uh we'll pass in any props that
16:43 - it needs and open that bad boy up okay
16:46 - and we'll just have it return a div that
16:49 - says login inside of it so pretty much
16:52 - not that much right now and of course
16:54 - let's export this so we have access to
16:56 - this component outside of this file into
16:58 - our other files capish good so I'm going
17:02 - to hit save now let's go into our appjs
17:05 - file because what I want to happen is I
17:07 - want to take this component use it
17:09 - inside of my appjs file and then have
17:12 - that be displayed on my screen so now
17:15 - let's go to our appjs file well in order
17:17 - to use that file what do we need to do
17:21 - the first thing we need to do is starts
17:23 - with an i then it has an M import okay
17:28 - so let's go ahead and import uh login
17:32 - okay from um and we're going to do
17:35 - components SL login all right and uh
17:39 - another thing we need for this is we
17:40 - also want to start using our react
17:42 - router okay so let's go ahead and import
17:45 - all of the things we need for that so
17:46 - we're going to do browser
17:49 - router okay like so and uh we're going
17:52 - to do as
17:54 - router okay comma
17:57 - switch um and let's do route okay so I'm
18:03 - I'm I'm basically getting browser router
18:05 - switch and Route those are the three
18:07 - things I'm getting okay and where am I
18:09 - getting them from great question from
18:12 - react router Dom like that okay and uh
18:16 - that's it cool well now we actually got
18:19 - to do our routing so I'm going to remove
18:23 - this
18:24 - H2 and I'm just going to start it off
18:26 - with router and I'm going to hit tab to
18:28 - auto complete that okay inside of that I
18:31 - got my switch okay and inside of my
18:34 - switch I'm going to have my route all
18:36 - right and this route is going to be an
18:38 - exact path all right and this exact path
18:41 - is just going to be the homepage okay so
18:44 - let's hit refresh it's complaining about
18:47 - something what is it complaining about
18:49 - well let's see what is the error about
18:51 - let's hit
18:52 - save okay did we do yarn start we did
18:55 - not do yarn start so of course it's
18:57 - complaining Mak total sense
19:00 - boom now let's hit restart beautiful
19:05 - okay and now you're like hey I don't see
19:08 - anything on the screen there's nothing
19:09 - here well yes because inside of Route
19:12 - you still didn't add in the login
19:14 - component so let's add in the login
19:16 - component Let's uh do that okay this is
19:20 - a component we imported we added it
19:22 - there and now you see login taada okay
19:27 - that's it so we're pretty much now set
19:30 - to go and start working more on like
19:32 - styling our login component and adding
19:35 - more things to it so let's just go ahead
19:36 - and start doing that now okay great job
19:38 - so far so now let's keep rocking and
19:40 - rolling okay we got basic login
19:43 - component functionality working okay now
19:45 - we're going to add a container and we're
19:47 - going to start adding some nav
19:48 - components and we're going to add some
19:49 - styling to this okay so let's go ahead
19:52 - and do that so I'm going to do a few
19:54 - things so first of all um I'm going to
19:57 - find this SV G right here okay uh I'm
20:00 - going to put that inside of my images
20:03 - folder so I want you to actually find uh
20:06 - an SVG again it's going to be in the
20:08 - comments below or in the description
20:11 - below for you so don't worry about that
20:13 - to put it right here in my images okay
20:16 - awesome so hopefully now you got it in
20:18 - your folder let's keep on rocking and
20:20 - rolling and guys you know if you want to
20:22 - know how to stop and start your server
20:23 - is contrl c contrl c stops it okay then
20:26 - you can install whatever modules you
20:28 - need to install and then you can do npm
20:30 - start so um just make sure your server
20:33 - is running otherwise your app is not
20:34 - going to show up here okay just a little
20:36 - note Okay cool so now let's keep going
20:39 - through this so I'm going to go inside
20:40 - of my login component and uh we're going
20:43 - to now start adding some uh styling and
20:46 - stuff here okay so uh just bear with me
20:49 - so first things first okay I'm going to
20:51 - just remove this entire line right now
20:53 - don't need that and we're going to start
20:55 - with a return statement okay and let's
20:58 - create a container component okay and
21:02 - inside of our container component let's
21:03 - create our nav component and again hit
21:06 - tab okay and then inside of our nav I'm
21:09 - going to add a link tag okay and then
21:13 - this link tag is pretty much going to uh
21:16 - do nothing as of now and it's just going
21:19 - to be the LinkedIn SVG logo okay that's
21:22 - it so effectively what is this going to
21:24 - be it's going to be this thing right
21:26 - over here okay just so you know where
21:28 - headed and what we're doing that's what
21:30 - we're building
21:31 - okay so it's going to be a link and
21:34 - inside of this link all right we're
21:37 - going to add our image tag okay so
21:39 - notice the hierarchy container nav
21:42 - inside of there we have a link and
21:43 - inside of there we have our image tag
21:46 - okay IMG hit tab to
21:48 - autocomplete um from my images folder
21:51 - I'm going to get my login logo. SVG that
21:56 - gets me my um SVG that I'm looking for
21:59 - and now look it's complaining it's like
22:01 - hey I don't know what container is or
22:03 - nav is make sure to keep hitting command
22:05 - s or control s to keep saving okay so
22:07 - now what this is complaining about is
22:09 - all that means is we actually need our
22:11 - container and nav style styling okay so
22:14 - let's go ahead and just style them not a
22:16 - big deal at all so first things first
22:19 - I'm going to hit cons container okay and
22:22 - I'm going to create a style div and I'm
22:24 - going to put Tilda Tilda okay Tilda is
22:27 - the key that's right above tab okay and
22:29 - just hit save so I'm going to leave this
22:31 - style component empty for now okay and
22:34 - then I'm going to create a style
22:36 - component for my nav bar so I'm going to
22:37 - do const nav and I'm going to do
22:41 - styled. naav and I'm going to do Tilda
22:44 - Tilda and save and stop right there okay
22:48 - so what am I doing here I'm giving it
22:50 - empty styling okay if I do that well you
22:54 - should now have a LinkedIn
22:56 - clone okay awesome okay so now I'm going
23:00 - to start adding some styling okay and
23:03 - what that's going to allow me to do is
23:04 - it's going to allow me to control that
23:06 - image cuz that image right now is just
23:08 - straight up out of control right cuz you
23:09 - don't want your LinkedIn to look that
23:11 - freaking massive so inside of here I'm
23:14 - just going to hit enter enter okay and
23:16 - then uh padding going to give it zero
23:19 - pixel padding okay so on the container
23:21 - side I'm done for now and inside of my
23:24 - Nav Now I want to style this okay and
23:26 - this is where it gets like interesting
23:29 - what I need to do all right so let's go
23:31 - ahead and give it a Max width
23:34 - of uh 1128 pixels hit refresh okay cool
23:42 - and then uh let's go ahead and give it
23:44 - margin
23:46 - Auto okay and um going to give it a
23:50 - padding of 12 pixels by 0 x 16 pixels
23:54 - okay so now we saw a little bit of like
23:57 - padding kind of kick in so it's not
23:59 - completely touching the the top part
24:03 - right of our um of our browser cuz that
24:06 - didn't look great and now we're going to
24:08 - actually use flex so to enable Flex you
24:11 - got to do display Flex okay now you
24:13 - might be wondering hey where did it go
24:15 - bring it back don't worry we're going to
24:18 - bring it back really soon okay just hang
24:19 - in there for me align items this is
24:22 - going to allow us to align it centrally
24:25 - okay this is vertical alignment
24:28 - and then let's go ahead and do position
24:31 - relative okay and um I'm going to do
24:35 - another thing I'm going to do justify
24:36 - content and I'm going to do space
24:38 - between and I'll explain why I'm going
24:39 - to do space between in just a
24:42 - second all right and uh let's give it a
24:45 - flex wrap of no wrap I don't want these
24:49 - to wrap and go to new lines because for
24:52 - my browser right if I have this Navar
24:55 - right here I don't want it to wrap and
24:57 - then go essentially to new lines that's
24:58 - not something that I want okay so this
25:02 - is looking good so far and um then I
25:06 - think I just want to do a few more
25:08 - things to make sure that we're good to
25:10 - go okay I'm just going to say
25:13 - hey anything that's you know inside of
25:16 - the a tag do a few things with it give
25:19 - it a width of 135 pixels so now this
25:23 - image has a specific width we controlled
25:26 - it right this is what we essentially
25:28 - want wanted to do now let's go ahead
25:30 - down and I'm going to give it a height
25:31 - of 34 pixels cool okay and now what I
25:36 - want to do is Media query okay so this
25:38 - is something cool that I want you guys
25:40 - to learn and what I'm saying here okay
25:44 - is on a phone this line here all that
25:49 - means is on a phone do the following
25:53 - okay so I'm going to open squiggly
25:55 - brackets just going to say give it a
25:57 - padding of 0x 5 pixels like that okay so
26:02 - if we're on a responsive mobile device
26:06 - it's just going to look slightly
26:08 - different all right this is going to
26:10 - make a big impact later on so with that
26:14 - said with the currently with the Navar
26:17 - and where we're trying to place our
26:18 - LinkedIn clone we are good now let me
26:20 - explain why we did space between
26:23 - remember how the final version should
26:25 - look well guess what guess how this is
26:29 - separated because of space
26:33 - between okay and guess why it doesn't
26:37 - run on new lines Why join now is not
26:40 - here and why sign in is not here CU of
26:42 - flex no WP okay all these little things
26:47 - make a huge freaking difference okay and
26:50 - you can play around with it you can
26:51 - delete lines and like go back and forth
26:54 - and see if that actually does anything
26:56 - okay and that's another way to like like
26:58 - pick up and get better at these skills
27:00 - okay so let's keep going and by the way
27:02 - if you're wondering why your code
27:04 - especially inside of the style
27:05 - components doesn't look like mine and
27:07 - it's looking like it's just one giant
27:08 - long string and it freaks you out um
27:11 - what I recommend is go to extensions and
27:13 - you can get vs code um just type in
27:15 - styled
27:16 - components okay and you can get like one
27:19 - of the styled components extensions that
27:21 - might actually help you I think it's
27:22 - called vs
27:24 - code
27:25 - styled components that one
27:28 - so you can get that one and I think
27:30 - that'll like give you the highlighting
27:31 - you're looking for and make your things
27:33 - look normal okay I have tons of
27:35 - extensions but that's um one of the ones
27:37 - that's really helpful all right cool so
27:40 - now let's go ahead and add the join now
27:42 - button in our app okay and that's going
27:44 - to be that beautiful button right there
27:47 - and it has couple of features I want to
27:48 - show you when I hover over it it has
27:50 - that little gray color that happens also
27:53 - notice that it has a nice little border
27:55 - radius so we're going to go ahead and
27:57 - build that now so let's go ahead and do
27:59 - that so first things first I'm going to
28:02 - go inside of my login.js I'm already
28:06 - here so that's good and then underneath
28:09 - this image right here uh the the login
28:13 - logo so go underneath that okay that
28:15 - link tag as well and I'm just going to
28:18 - open up a div and inside of it I'm going
28:20 - to create a new component called join
28:22 - inside of that I'll just say join now
28:25 - okay now again you should be at this
28:28 - point where it's complaining join is not
28:31 - defined blah blah blah blah blah okay
28:34 - cool well not a big problem now all we
28:37 - have to do is actually just go ahead and
28:39 - create our join component so I'm just
28:41 - going to do const join and let's just
28:44 - get started okay and um styled a and
28:48 - leave it empty for now save okay so now
28:51 - at least you have join now up here on
28:54 - the top right okay so now let's start
28:57 - with the styling so go inside of it hit
28:59 - enter twice and let's go so let's choose
29:02 - font size and I I think I'm going to go
29:04 - with font size 16 pixels on that one all
29:09 - right so now underneath the font size
29:12 - I'm going to add a padding of 10 pixels
29:14 - by 12 pixels on this thing okay so you
29:18 - can see it got pushed just a little bit
29:20 - from The Edge that's exactly what we're
29:22 - looking for uh text decoration um none
29:26 - because for my link tags I don't want
29:28 - want them to have an underline so that
29:30 - is to just make sure that that happens
29:32 - and for color I'm going to go with
29:36 - something like this okay just a not
29:40 - completely black it's a little bit
29:43 - grayish okay so that's what I want to do
29:46 - here um as a matter of fact actually
29:49 - what I can do is
29:51 - 0.08 okay
29:54 - so I think yeah let's leave it at this
29:58 - actually I'll
29:59 - 0.08 after hover okay so let's go here
30:04 - let's give it a margin right of 12
30:08 - pixels great get giving it some more
30:10 - distance from the right hand side
30:12 - because we're going to put something
30:13 - else there and then let's go ahead and
30:16 - say that on Hover we want certain things
30:19 - to happen because right now it still
30:20 - doesn't have any hover functionality
30:22 - right so let's go ahead and do that so
30:24 - on Hover we're actually going to change
30:26 - the background color and um I'm going to
30:29 - do this to the background color okay so
30:32 - what does that mean when I hover over it
30:34 - has a lighter gray right so it's kind of
30:36 - a dark gray joint now when I hover over
30:38 - it there's a lighter gray behind it okay
30:41 - cool now I'm also going to change the
30:43 - font color on
30:46 - Hover okay and I'm probably going to
30:49 - what I'm going to do is I'm probably
30:51 - going to make it just a little bit
30:53 - darker so let's go here boom so the font
30:56 - color turns a little bit darker as you
30:58 - can see and then let's add text
31:02 - decoration of uh
31:05 - none okay and all of that is looking
31:09 - good so when I hover over okay no
31:11 - underlines no weird stuff happening and
31:14 - you know one last thing is that it's
31:16 - still looking pretty Square to me what I
31:18 - want to happen is I want to give it the
31:20 - little little rounded Corners so let's
31:23 - add some border radius to this thing so
31:25 - I'm going to go border radius and uh for
31:28 - Border radius I'm just going to say hey
31:30 - give me four pixel border radius on this
31:32 - thing okay so when I hover over I got a
31:35 - nice little rounded corners and uh the
31:38 - join now button is looking absolutely
31:41 - great okay amazing we're doing great so
31:44 - far guys if you guys are enjoying this
31:45 - video by the way so far smash that like
31:47 - button break that thing and of course
31:49 - subscribe to the channel if you haven't
31:51 - already and uh let's just keep on going
31:54 - so and the one thing I still want to do
31:57 - is to index I want to actually add to
31:59 - our index as CSS I just want to add some
32:02 - fonts okay so going to um our body right
32:07 - what I want to do is actually just want
32:09 - to add a font family here okay so let's
32:12 - go ahead and add uh to our
32:15 - body okay and we're going to add uh
32:19 - certain uh fonts okay and the only fonts
32:22 - I really want to add here is font family
32:24 - I just want to add
32:26 - aial aiel like this and then I just want
32:29 - to add Sans
32:31 - serif okay fall back and so yeah now the
32:36 - fonts are looking good kind of what
32:38 - we're looking for and with that said
32:40 - let's just jump in to start working on
32:42 - our sign in component okay that's that
32:45 - thing right there so let's go ahead and
32:46 - do that so signin component we're going
32:49 - to need a couple of things so let's go
32:51 - to our
32:52 - login um component inside of our login
32:55 - component I'm going to make a our sign
32:58 - in component right underneath the join
33:01 - uh the join button okay but it's going
33:03 - to be in the same div okay so this is
33:06 - important to understand same div the
33:08 - join now component and right underneath
33:10 - it we're going to have sign in component
33:13 - okay hit tab to autocomplete that and
33:16 - then I'm just going to do sign in okay
33:18 - now again it's complaining his sign n is
33:21 - not defined so same thing here you guys
33:24 - know the rules let's create a St in for
33:28 - our signin component okay and uh this is
33:31 - going to be a a tag AKA link tag and
33:35 - then let's just hit save cool so what
33:38 - you should see now is you should have
33:39 - sign in on your screen if you full
33:41 - screen it you should have sign in right
33:43 - there okay and now we're going to go
33:46 - inside of this and start actually adding
33:48 - this thing so I'm going to add a little
33:50 - box Shadow to this and um you know I use
33:54 - the Box Shadow generator that's what you
33:56 - can do as well but here you're just
33:59 - going to get the final version so we got
34:02 - a little box Shadow around this thing so
34:04 - you see now a blue
34:07 - outline outside of your sign
34:09 - in all right we're going to give it a
34:11 - color of um a little bluish color for
34:15 - the sign in as well okay and for Border
34:18 - radius let's give it 24 pixels cool so
34:23 - now it's looking nice and round that's
34:24 - good okay I'm going to give it a
34:27 - transition duration of 167 milliseconds
34:31 - okay so you're going to see that's going
34:33 - to come into play later on like for
34:34 - example when I hover over this it has a
34:36 - little nice transition that's happening
34:39 - there that takes 167 milliseconds it
34:41 - seems like just give it a font size of
34:44 - 16 pixels okay and I'm going to give it
34:48 - a font weight of
34:51 - 600 okay so now it's a little bit Bolder
34:55 - line height give it 40
34:58 - pixel line height okay so now boom all
35:02 - of this stuff got pushed down just a
35:04 - little bit and um on top of this I'm
35:07 - going to do a couple of more things to
35:09 - this let's give it a little padding I
35:11 - think okay so padding I I'm thinking 10
35:14 - pixels by 24 pixels like that okay so
35:20 - now sign in component is looking a
35:22 - little bit funny it looks good here but
35:24 - on mobile mobile device it's freaking
35:27 - cut in half so it looks stupid so we're
35:29 - going to fix that don't worry okay so
35:32 - that's our padding Now text align
35:35 - it um in
35:38 - Center okay and then we're going to go
35:41 - background color for it and background
35:44 - color is going to be
35:46 - a just that okay so so far so good and
35:52 - then on Hover we're going to give it
35:54 - some functionality okay on Hover
35:58 - I'm going to say that the background
36:00 - color is going to be let's go like
36:04 - that okay actually let's make it
36:08 - this to 49 by okay it refresh cool okay
36:15 - so now when I hover over it you see that
36:17 - there's a blue color that's happening
36:21 - okay and when I remove the transition
36:24 - look it just happens instantly so we
36:26 - don't want that effect I want that
36:28 - transition there because it allows me to
36:30 - make it blue but with a nice little
36:32 - transition on Hover and then on top of
36:35 - that I want the font color to change
36:37 - when I hover on it and I want it to be
36:40 - this
36:41 - blue uh right here on Hover okay so
36:46 - that's good and then of course text
36:48 - decoration even though right now it's
36:51 - good but let's just add this for safety
36:53 - and just good um you know default
36:57 - behaviors and patterns Okay cool so our
37:02 - sign in on your computer should be
37:04 - looking good okay it's just cuz I was
37:05 - zoomed in like too much at 175% so when
37:08 - I'm in here it looks good okay cuz I'm
37:11 - on a giant TV so I'm trying to zoom in
37:12 - but now you should be good
37:15 - okay so with that said our login
37:17 - component is looking pretty good now
37:19 - we're going to start adding in our
37:21 - sections and putting in main content in
37:23 - there right now okay so now let's
37:25 - actually work on our
37:28 - section so in section basically it's
37:31 - going to be this big section over here
37:33 - okay so now we need to make that work at
37:36 - the image so it's also mobile responsive
37:38 - right cuz for example it's here like
37:39 - this but when I full screen it
37:42 - ta completely different right boom and
37:46 - now it's here but when I go mobile the
37:50 - image is in the middle the text at the
37:51 - top how is that happening so we'll show
37:54 - you the magic behind the scenes let's uh
37:56 - go to our log .js over here now right
38:00 - underneath the nav bar we're going to
38:03 - add our
38:04 - section that's going to be our new
38:06 - component all right all right so now of
38:10 - course it's going to complain and do our
38:12 - favorite complain which is section is
38:14 - not defined okay so now it just means
38:17 - that we haven't had it added the styling
38:20 - part of this okay so let's go ahead and
38:21 - do that I'm going to uh create a section
38:25 - styling like this and it's going to be
38:27 - section okay
38:29 - save um cool so that's good now of
38:32 - course you know the drill enter enter
38:34 - inside of here and let's start adding
38:36 - what we want okay so first things first
38:39 - let's go align content and start oops
38:43 - start okay now make sure let's also do
38:47 - display Flex because we're going to need
38:50 - that
38:52 - okay uh Min height I'm going to keep
38:55 - that at a 700 100 pixels for this thing
39:00 - okay and uh let's give it padding Bottom
39:04 - now some of the stuff you guys are not
39:06 - going to see okay like for example
39:09 - padding bottom you're not going to see
39:11 - it but what it's actually doing is if
39:13 - you added more content underneath this
39:15 - so like for example say section is like
39:17 - this right if I added something else
39:20 - underneath section it would start adding
39:22 - it from here but that's not what we want
39:25 - we want to give it a little padding
39:28 - so that padding that's what we're giving
39:30 - it right now okay so that's why some of
39:33 - the stuff is going to be invisible and
39:34 - you're be like what the hell are you
39:35 - writing KY and why isn't it it's not
39:37 - doing anything but trust me it's
39:39 - actually adding padding that is good
39:41 - convention to do
39:43 - that okay uh conversely this is going to
39:47 - add padding to the top so just like this
39:49 - right now you saw it gave some breathing
39:52 - space between the Navar and this section
39:55 - starting over here okay
39:58 - so cool we added padding to the top
40:01 - padding to the bottom and now we'll
40:04 - do this all right cool so just giving it
40:08 - some additional
40:11 - padding now I'm going to make the
40:14 - position
40:15 - relative okay and um Flex wrap I'm going
40:19 - to actually do Wrap okay and the reason
40:24 - why I'm doing that is this is the
40:25 - wrapping is what's align allowing this
40:27 - image to get wrapped around which means
40:29 - when I do this it wraps it okay so
40:32 - that's what we want that means if the
40:33 - screen goes too small those things wrap
40:36 - and actually form new rows this is why
40:39 - Flex is so freaking helpful uh width
40:42 - we're going to give a width of 100% on
40:45 - this bad boy Max width is going to be
40:49 - 128 pixels okay align items because I
40:54 - want things to be in the center let's
40:56 - give it an align item of
40:58 - Center um margin Auto okay and then of
41:02 - course last and pretty important thing
41:05 - is on media how do I want it to behave
41:08 - so meaning like on my phone on my iPhone
41:11 - how do I want it to behave this is how I
41:14 - want it to behave okay and let's give it
41:16 - a Min height Min height of0 pixels like
41:20 - this okay let's open full screen okay so
41:23 - now the section is in the middle you
41:26 - guys are going start to see a lot of
41:28 - this Behavior once I start adding
41:31 - content to it okay it's going to start
41:32 - becoming a lot and a lot more
41:34 - clearer so now let's go ahead and start
41:37 - adding content to this thing and start
41:39 - adding stuff in our hero okay so let's
41:43 - go ahead and get our hero image so this
41:46 - is going to be our hero image that we're
41:47 - going to use right over here okay so
41:51 - we're are going to put that inside of
41:53 - our images folder oh and just one fix
41:56 - right here guys um this is PX right
41:59 - there okay so just make sure you have
42:01 - that 768 uh pixels cool okay now let's
42:05 - go to our um I mean we're already here
42:08 - in our login component okay hopefully
42:10 - you're here now underneath our section
42:13 - we're going to add hero under um
42:16 - actually it's going to be within our
42:19 - section okay so the hero is going to be
42:21 - within here okay so let's do this let's
42:24 - remove where we say section because
42:26 - that's not what we want anymore let's do
42:29 - hero as a component and hit Tab and uh
42:32 - just hit save so what it should look
42:34 - like is you should have section and hero
42:38 - should be inside of your section
42:40 - component okay now inside of your hero
42:44 - we're going to add an H1 and that's
42:47 - going to
42:48 - say welcome to your professional
42:51 - Community kind of like how it is on
42:53 - LinkedIn right it's save now again it's
42:55 - complaining hey here is not defined well
42:58 - again that makes sense my friend because
43:02 - you know the deal we need to actually go
43:04 - ahead and uh make the style component
43:06 - for it so we're going to do const hero
43:09 - style div okay do that and hit save so
43:14 - now we should have welcome to your poor
43:17 - professional community so let's um fix
43:21 - that welcome to your professional
43:23 - Community great and let's just go here
43:26 - and start start adding our width at
43:29 - 100% why does it always autocomplete to
43:32 - that it's so silly okay and uh we're
43:35 - going to style the H1 inside of here
43:38 - like the following okay so we're going
43:39 - to give it a padding bottom of
43:43 - zero okay we'll give it a width of
43:47 - 55
43:48 - Jesus so welcome to your professional
43:51 - Community that's what it should be
43:52 - looking like okay and that just happened
43:54 - because of the width that I gave it cool
43:58 - all right now we'll give it a font size
44:02 - of 56 pixels like
44:06 - so big font that's kind of cool like it
44:10 - actually looks powerful as soon as I did
44:13 - that and let's give it a color of
44:18 - 2977 C9 okay so this is going to be a
44:22 - light blue font weight let's give it a
44:27 - 200 font weight okay so not super thick
44:31 - and bold not Thicker Than a Snicker okay
44:35 - this is very linked iny linked iny vibe
44:37 - that we have here let's give it a line
44:40 - height of about 70 pixels okay great so
44:45 - that gives it some Breathing Room in
44:46 - between each line like so and um after
44:49 - line height let's add in a media query
44:52 - so we tell it how to behave on a mobile
44:54 - device okay so let's go Max withth
44:57 - okay and this is a mobile device 768
45:01 - pixels text align on a mobile device
45:04 - should be Center so it should be
45:05 - vertically aligned okay let's go
45:09 - font size to be 20 pixels all right
45:14 - great and then let's go width to be a
45:19 - 100% great and then let's go line height
45:24 - to be about two
45:27 - great okay so this is what it looks like
45:30 - on a normal screen and then this is what
45:32 - it should look like on a mobile screen
45:35 - right in the center fits nicely looks
45:39 - great just like
45:41 - you thanks for watching so far let's
45:44 - keep going all right so this is good now
45:49 - I want to get outside of this H1 okay
45:52 - and now let's style the image inside of
45:54 - here because we we want to add the image
45:56 - and we want to tell it how to um how to
46:00 - behave okay so let's go uh above all the
46:04 - way here where inside of our hero we
46:06 - added the H1 let's also go ahead inside
46:08 - of this H1 and inside we're going to add
46:12 - our image okay so let's go outside of
46:15 - this you know correction hit image and
46:17 - autocomplete that and um I want to pull
46:21 - the image that we added okay and it's
46:24 - basically login Das hero .
46:28 - SVG okay so now you should have the
46:31 - image showing up man it's already
46:34 - looking pretty freaking nice okay just
46:37 - make sure you didn't do any misspelling
46:39 - so like look welcome to your
46:40 - professional Community is looking good
46:41 - but this image is looking way too big so
46:44 - we need to control it that's what we're
46:46 - going to do let's go to the bottom and
46:49 - let's go inside of our image and we're
46:51 - going to just control this freaking
46:52 - thing okay right now so first of all
46:55 - let's give it a zindex of minus one and
46:58 - why we're doing that is so if a text is
47:00 - overlapping it it's always on top okay
47:03 - image should have this image should not
47:05 - have the most priority the text should
47:07 - have a higher priority than this okay
47:10 - now wi let's go 700 pixels on the width
47:15 - cool uh it just exploded but don't worry
47:17 - we're going to control that so now on
47:21 - full screen notice we have made it
47:23 - already smaller okay before it was like
47:25 - even bigger than this
47:27 - okay for position we're going to do
47:31 - absolute okay and then bottom let's go
47:36 - -2
47:38 - pixels okay look at that it's like in a
47:42 - weird position look at that boom right
47:45 - there right there okay don't worry we're
47:48 - going to take care of that right now
47:49 - let's go Nega 150 pixels uh right there
47:54 - cool and um it's kind of kind of like
47:57 - watching a painter paint you know where
48:00 - it's like not making sense and then all
48:01 - of a sudden it kind of comes together
48:03 - and your brain is blown uh apart on a
48:06 - phone how I want it to behave is top
48:09 - give me uh 230 pixels okay and then with
48:15 - so like from the top right from the top
48:18 - make it drop that's a wet you know what
48:19 - I'm talking about so like for example if
48:22 - I change this to like 50 pixels right it
48:24 - goes higher up but to 2 30 pixels is
48:28 - gives me that nice little touch that I'm
48:30 - looking for on a mobile device but don't
48:32 - worry right now it's like kind of
48:33 - invisible on the full screen so we'll
48:36 - we'll um fix that as well okay but let's
48:40 - just make sure it's good on the mobile
48:41 - device so with we're going to go with
48:44 - initial and then position we're going to
48:48 - go with um going to go with initial as
48:52 - well and um I'm going to do the same
48:54 - thing for height and I'm going to go
48:55 - with initial
48:58 - okay so now on mobile device it is
49:02 - looking
49:03 - beautiful okay absolutely gorgeous so so
49:08 - far so good all right folks so one of
49:11 - the problems I'm running into right now
49:13 - is my image on full screen is going
49:15 - invisible but on Mobile screen it's
49:17 - there if that's happening with you um
49:20 - actually comment out the zindex minus
49:23 - one line and now your image should be
49:25 - showing up okay okay and you should be
49:27 - good to go so let's keep on going ahead
49:31 - here and adding more functionality to
49:32 - our app so I want to add in the Google
49:35 - form component okay so I want to add in
49:38 - like the Google
49:39 - login um so let's go ahead and get that
49:42 - Google logo okay so take that add it to
49:46 - your images okay awesome so now after
49:50 - adding that Google SVG let's go ahead
49:53 - and start adding that to our login okay
49:55 - so here's how we're going to do it uh
49:57 - let's go right underneath um actually we
50:01 - can keep this inside of the hero section
50:03 - right because that's where we want it so
50:05 - inside of our hero I'm going to add a
50:09 - form okay so let's go ahead and add that
50:12 - form um actually this form I'll probably
50:17 - add it right outside of the hero okay I
50:19 - apologize for the confusion and throwing
50:22 - you all over the place let's add form
50:24 - here okay and we're going to work on the
50:27 - styling of this form and then inside of
50:28 - here I'm going to have another component
50:30 - called Google just like that okay and
50:34 - I'm going to throw in an image inside of
50:35 - the Google component and it's going to
50:38 - be my uh Google SVG component okay or
50:42 - not component I'm sorry the SVG file
50:45 - okay the image and um right underneath
50:48 - this let's go ahead and just say sign in
50:51 - with Google like so okay now again it's
50:55 - complaining hey form is on different
50:56 - Google is not defined you guys know the
51:00 - drill let's create stylings for them
51:03 - that's what it's complaining about so
51:05 - I'm going to create a form and this is
51:08 - going to be a styled div all right we're
51:12 - going to leave it like this and then I'm
51:14 - going to create Google and this is going
51:16 - to be a style button and I'm going to
51:17 - leave it like that
51:19 - refresh boom we got the sign in with
51:22 - Google form all the way at the bottom
51:25 - you should be seeing that right there
51:26 - there let me make myself just a little
51:28 - bit
51:29 - smaller okay so you can see it okay now
51:32 - let's go full screen like so beautiful
51:36 - looking good so far I can be here and be
51:41 - good all right full
51:43 - screen and uh looks great now inside of
51:48 - our form let's start adding styling in
51:51 - here so let's start off by giving it a
51:54 - margin top of 100 pixels start
51:59 - there so that gave it a bunch of margin
52:03 - and that's really good okay because we
52:06 - definitely want to add some margin in
52:08 - there so that way nothing weird happens
52:11 - okay and also it gives it plenty plenty
52:13 - of spacing that we want all right cool
52:17 - so that's good the other thing I'm going
52:19 - to add to my form is I'm going to give
52:22 - it a width of 400 pixels 408 pixels
52:27 - okay and then let's go ahead and give it
52:30 - a media query whoops media query I'm
52:35 - going to say Max width of 768 pixels
52:38 - which means hey I'm on a mobile device
52:41 - buddy on a mobile device I want you to
52:44 - give it a smaller margin top so it's not
52:46 - a
52:48 - huge margin top okay so you see it now
52:51 - it's a little bit closer to our image
52:54 - which makes sense which makes sense
52:57 - okay now inside of our let me actually
53:00 - all right so in our styled button let's
53:02 - go ahead and now add um let's basically
53:05 - add styling to this okay so let's just
53:08 - start with display Flex so we have Flex
53:11 - box enabled on here and then inside of
53:14 - here we're going to justify content and
53:17 - this is going to allow us to
53:19 - horizontally Center things so let's
53:21 - Center that I'm going to add a
53:24 - background color to this and uh let's
53:27 - just do
53:28 - FFF okay which is going to be this
53:31 - bright white that you just saw happen
53:33 - right
53:34 - there okay and um align items so I want
53:39 - to I want to Center align this thing
53:43 - okay so that's now looking a lot better
53:45 - let's go ahead and give it a height of
53:47 - 56 pixels
53:50 - so 100% width let's give it a border
53:54 - radius to give it nice little rounded
53:56 - Corners
53:58 - beautiful and now I'm going to give it a
54:01 - box Shadow that's going to be a little
54:02 - bit complicated here but again you can
54:05 - Auto generate these uh from box Shadow
54:10 - generators okay but just bear with me
54:13 - here because it is going to be worth it
54:17 - cuz it will make it look great okay ins
54:20 - set pixels RGB okay and uh let's give it
54:24 - a 0% here here okay I'm going to just
54:27 - save this and then let's do another
54:30 - inset
54:31 - there okay and um I think I'm going to
54:36 - just make it let's go RGB here and 0000
54:40 - /
54:43 - 0% okay
54:45 - so that's a mysterious looking thing but
54:50 - it gave it the Box shadow that we were
54:52 - looking for okay without it we just
54:55 - don't have that box Shadow so not the
54:57 - end of the world honestly whether you
54:59 - have that or not but you can add that in
55:02 - okay if you don't want to write all that
55:04 - out I won't blame you if you um if you
55:09 - avoid that cool so let's do vertical
55:14 - align and let's go
55:16 - middle okay and then um I'm going to
55:19 - give it a z index of
55:22 - zero let's also start adding in a
55:24 - transition duration for this because I
55:26 - want it to have a nice little effect as
55:29 - I hover over it okay and a font size of
55:33 - 20 pixels so now sign in with Google is
55:36 - looking much
55:37 - bigger so great and then uh I think
55:41 - color let's color it like so so that
55:45 - makes it just that little bit grayish
55:48 - color that is looking great and then now
55:52 - let's add in Hover functionality on this
55:54 - thing guys because once we have that
55:56 - hover then it's going to do things when
55:58 - we hover on it does that make sense okay
56:01 - let's go ahead and do that guys and
56:03 - let's keep the freaking energy alive and
56:05 - up in here so I'm glad that you guys are
56:08 - with me and rocking and rolling okay if
56:10 - you have been if you made it with us so
56:12 - far smash the like button like look at
56:14 - how good this freaking thing looks right
56:16 - on your portfolio it's going to look so
56:18 - great and it's just going to make you
56:19 - stand out from so many of the other
56:22 - people out there so let's keep going so
56:25 - on Hover let's basically add a
56:27 - background color changing all right so
56:31 - let's do
56:32 - this uh let's give it it 207
56:36 - 207 another 207 and we're going to give
56:38 - it a
56:40 - 0.25 okay so now when I hover it has
56:43 - that little gray color showing up in the
56:46 - background okay all right so we gave it
56:49 - a little background color now let's go
56:51 - ahead and also add a f color for this
56:54 - okay and I'm going to get give it um
56:59 - this color right here 0.05 so when I
57:01 - hover over it makes the text a little
57:03 - bit darker okay that's a nice little
57:07 - touch and now again we're going to add a
57:10 - little Annoying box Shadow thing with
57:12 - honestly I'm just going to skip because
57:14 - I hate for you guys to have to type it
57:16 - all out just looks annoying it's just
57:18 - annoying so this is uh great so far I
57:22 - think this is good and I think that um
57:26 - this looks great so far so let's keep
57:28 - going okay so next up um we're going to
57:33 - um add a couple of more things to this
57:35 - okay so that should complete your basic
57:37 - form and the sign in with Google and
57:40 - let's basically add now some header
57:43 - functionality okay so I'm going to go
57:44 - inside of my header and this header is
57:47 - going to be on the homepage so what does
57:49 - that mean if I go to
57:51 - slome okay we I want to be able to get
57:54 - routed there so this is the completely
57:57 - built app okay this is the built version
58:00 - the final deployed version and when I
58:03 - sign in with Google right when I do
58:05 - slome it should take me to this page so
58:08 - now we're going to actually start
58:09 - working on this page and working on this
58:12 - header here as well so let's go ahead
58:14 - and get started with that so first
58:17 - things first inside of my um let's make
58:19 - our header component and then we're
58:21 - going to make our home component or
58:22 - let's do it the other way let's make the
58:24 - home component first so in inside of
58:26 - components I'm going to make a new not
58:29 - folder new file and this is going to be
58:32 - home JS and I'm going to do import
58:34 - styled from styled components here all
58:38 - right and then I'm going to create a
58:40 - component called
58:42 - home okay and then I'm going to return
58:46 - div and let's just do home like this
58:49 - okay perfect that's all good and let's
58:51 - just go ahead and Export default home so
58:54 - now this is a component we have access
58:56 - to in other areas now let's go ahead and
58:58 - create our header component okay so
59:01 - let's go inside of components new file
59:03 - header. JS just like so and inside of
59:06 - our header JS we're going to do this
59:09 - pretty much the similar thing import
59:11 - style from style components and let's
59:14 - create our header component like that
59:17 - give it the argument of props and we'll
59:21 - return a div that just has the text
59:23 - header inside of it that's it for now
59:25 - and now inside of our app.js we're just
59:28 - going to import these okay so here's
59:30 - what that's going to look like so under
59:34 - login we have uh under login we have
59:38 - this route ending we'll create another
59:40 - route okay create another route and this
59:44 - is going to match the path of home like
59:49 - this and then inside of here we'll have
59:53 - header okay let's go header let's make
59:56 - sure that in our header component we
59:58 - export default header because that's why
60:01 - it couldn't autocomplete it it seems
60:03 - like let's go back and now I'll go
60:07 - header and boom it will autocomplete it
60:10 - and uh it we just imported header up
60:14 - there and uh let's also
60:17 - import uh home okay so I'm going to do
60:21 - home home like that and so I imported
60:26 - header from components header I imported
60:28 - home from components home we got header
60:31 - and home under the route called path
60:34 - slome so that means now I should be able
60:37 - to go slome and it should take me to it
60:40 - so both of those components are showing
60:43 - and that's exactly what we wanted
60:46 - perfect so now you should be able to go
60:48 - to slome see all of this stuff and uh
60:51 - let's keep rocking and rolling here okay
60:54 - so next up let's add in our containers
60:58 - you know how I like to do these things
61:00 - guys so let's go to our header file okay
61:05 - and inside of our header we're going to
61:08 - do a couple of things so you guys are
61:09 - going to need to keep up with me okay so
61:12 - let's go ahead and um add a container
61:16 - inside of the container let's add our

62:42 - ahead and add left
62:46 - zero okay and underneath this let's add
62:49 - some padding so we'll go uh 0 by 24
62:53 - pixels just like that position I'm I'm
62:55 - going to go ahead and go fixed top give
62:58 - it
62:59 - zero and I'm just going to give it a
63:02 - crazy Z index cuz I want to make sure
63:04 - that that always stays on
63:06 - top okay and that's like never going
63:09 - away anywhere again a lot of this stuff
63:11 - is going to be invisible until you click
63:13 - into it like this and now you'll see
63:16 - this header okay I'm I'm in inspect mode
63:19 - so just bear with me promise it's going
63:22 - to get better let's give it a background
63:25 - color or actually no I'm sorry let's not
63:27 - do that let's give it let's do display
63:30 - Flex so now we have the flex mode
63:33 - enabled now let's go align items Center

63:41 - let's go margin zero
63:44 - Auto and let's go main height
63:48 - 100% okay hit save and let's go Max
63:52 - width of
63:53 - 128 pixels okay awesome now with this
63:57 - guys you're not going to see much again
63:59 - this is to set us up for our next step
64:02 - where we're going to now start adding
64:03 - the logo in the header okay and then
64:06 - you're can actually start to see what
64:08 - this code was doing so let's go ahead
64:11 - and now add the logo so I'm going to
64:13 - grab the home logo and um I'm going to
64:18 - add it in our images okay boom right
64:21 - there now let's go back to our header
64:25 - file
64:26 - and in our header file I'm going to now
64:29 - start by adding this image so let's go
64:32 - to the top and inside of content let's
64:35 - remove the word header we don't need
64:37 - that anymore let's add a component
64:41 - called logo inside of that let's add a
64:45 - link
64:46 - tag okay and um we're going to say that
64:49 - this image should take us to the
64:51 - homepage meaning that if I'm logged in
64:54 - if I hit that image right right there
64:56 - you know it should take me
64:59 - essentially to the
65:01 - homepage okay which is this page right
65:04 - here okay so now we're just going to add
65:07 - the actual logo and the
65:10 - image so inside of this link tag let's
65:13 - add an image tag like
65:15 - so and this image tag is going to be/
65:18 - images slh home-
65:22 - logo.svg okay that's what we just added
65:25 - right here here home
65:27 - logo.svg now style components is going
65:29 - to complain it's going to say hey I
65:31 - don't see this component or The Styling
65:33 - for it no worries let's go ahead and add
65:36 - it my friend so I'm going to add a logo
65:39 - like this styled and I'm going to make
65:41 - it a span tag let's make it empty for
65:43 - now and let's do
65:46 - margin right 8
65:48 - pixels and then let's go ahead and do
65:51 - font size about 0 pixels just like so
65:55 - let's hit refresh and
65:57 - TDA all of that work that we had done
66:01 - earlier is now showing us what's going
66:05 - on okay so let's try removing these
66:08 - things and let's see if it makes a
66:09 - difference right so I removed container
66:12 - and look you cannot see anything right
66:15 - but now let me bring everything inside
66:16 - of container and now you can see it and
66:19 - now you can see why we gave it a color
66:21 - of white cuz now it's visually there
66:24 - okay
66:26 - so great
66:28 - work all right so now let's go ahead and
66:32 - add search and input and search icon so
66:35 - for example this search bar right here
66:38 - let's go ahead and add it and let's go
66:41 - ahead and uh get started on it right now
66:44 - boom so first things first we're going
66:46 - to go ahead into our header file okay
66:49 - and uh in our header file we're going to
66:51 - do a bunch of stuff okay along with like
66:55 - some stuff with SVG okay so what I'll
66:57 - try to do is I'll try to kind of um give
67:02 - you this SVG so you can have access to
67:04 - it as well okay so let's keep going I'm
67:07 - going to give you access to the SVG file
67:09 - too in a second but let's go ahead under
67:11 - our logo and under our logo what I'm
67:15 - going to do is I'm going to create a
67:17 - search component okay and uh let's hit
67:21 - search and I'm going to hit tab all
67:24 - right inside of my search component I'm
67:26 - going to create a new div inside of that
67:29 - div I'm going to create an input okay
67:33 - and um I'm going to add a placeholder
67:36 - all right just like so now I'm going to
67:39 - go and create a new component called
67:41 - search icon let me actually go ahead and
67:43 - do that like this okay search icon will
67:46 - be inside of my search component so that
67:48 - makes sense all right now inside of my
67:52 - search icon I'm going to add my
67:56 - SVG uh logo SL path okay so I'm going to
68:00 - give you access to this as well but here
68:03 - it is all right if you guys need it
68:06 - again all of this is going to be linked
68:08 - in the description below so that way you
68:10 - guys have access to it okay so it's an
68:13 - SVG and then all we got to do is uh we
68:17 - just have to close out of this
68:21 - SVG okay just like so so boom now again
68:27 - search is not defined search icon is not
68:29 - defined so we're just going to go ahead
68:30 - and create those okay so let's go ahead
68:32 - and let's do search first and then we're
68:35 - going to do search icon so let's go
68:37 - search and um you guys know the drill
68:41 - I'm going to go ahead and make it empty
68:42 - for now and let's go ahead and create
68:45 - styling for our search icon as well I'll
68:47 - go and um do this okay so empty empty
68:52 - cool so we got our search icon right
68:54 - here we got our search bar right
68:58 - there um it is looking beautiful
69:03 - magnificent and uh we like it all right
69:06 - now all we have to do is start styling
69:08 - our search component all right so let's
69:11 - go ahead and style this thing okay so
69:14 - inside of our search I'm going to give
69:16 - it a opacity of one let's give it a flex
69:20 - grow of one as well okay and um
69:26 - I think I'm going to give it a position
69:29 - relative okay and then let's do the
69:34 - following for this div all right let's
69:38 - go Max with we'll go 280
69:42 - pixels
69:44 - okay input I'm going to go border none
69:50 - for the input so now notice that there's
69:53 - no border anymore so already looks much
69:56 - cleaner um box Shadow will go
70:00 - none and then background
70:03 - color
70:05 - ef3
70:06 - f8 okay that gives it a little light
70:11 - gray I'm going to go border radius of
70:14 - two pixels
70:20 - cool okay that's going to be the font
70:23 - color and width will go
70:27 - 218 pixels so now it's a little bit
70:31 - wider
70:36 - padding okay so great I'm going to give
70:40 - it a line height of
70:45 - 1.75 okay so it became a little uh you
70:49 - know wider from the top got a little bit
70:51 - more
70:52 - height a hence height
70:56 - font weight let's give it
71:00 - 400 great font size will give it 14
71:05 - pixels let's make sure we full screen it
71:08 - nice looks good looks really good height
71:14 - let's give it 34
71:16 - pixels border color I'm going to give it
71:21 - a this color right here cool and then
71:26 - vertical
71:27 - align text
71:30 - top okay great so this thing is looking
71:34 - good now the search bar okay now let's
71:38 - work on the search icon so we have the
71:42 - style div that we
71:44 - started then let's go ahead and style
71:46 - that search icon component as well so
71:49 - we're going to make the width 40 pixels
71:51 - for
71:52 - it position absolute
71:55 - Z index let's give it a
71:58 - one top 10
72:01 - pixels so now it's getting inside of
72:05 - that um search bar which is exactly what
72:08 - we want so that's good and we're doing
72:11 - that by using of course position
72:14 - absolute making sure that the zindex is
72:16 - making sure that it's not like hiding
72:18 - behind other things you know I don't
72:20 - know if I give it a z index of -200 it
72:24 - might hide behind other things right so
72:25 - zindex one just make sure hey don't hide
72:28 - don't be shy okay and then the position
72:32 - absolute just allows us to like position
72:34 - it okay now let's go border radius
72:40 - of that cool and then margin of
72:45 - zero great I don't want any box Shadow I
72:49 - mean I don't think I'm going to even add
72:50 - that
72:51 - line
72:53 - okay I mean I could have pointer events
72:56 - none for this let's go and
73:00 - see yeah it's kind of
73:02 - cool okay so there's no um that's a nice
73:06 - little touch right because if I save now
73:08 - if I hover over it my mouse still looks
73:10 - like a pointer right but watch what
73:14 - happens when I go pointer events none
73:15 - when I hover over it the whole thing is
73:19 - a text box it's a nice little finesse
73:23 - that we decide to put in here for you
73:26 - and uh of course let's go display Flex
73:28 - so we have flex functionalities and flex
73:31 - superpowers and uh
73:33 - let's uh horizontally align that great
73:36 - now it's a little bit closer to the
73:39 - search bar okay let's look at it oh man
73:44 - that search bar is looking
73:46 - nice all right and then align items
73:49 - we're going to align it to be Center and
73:52 - then of course let's add a transition
73:55 - background color and then have that
73:58 - transition be
74:00 - 0.15 seconds
74:04 - cool
74:06 - okay okay dokie okay I I mean I don't
74:10 - even think honestly we need that line
74:12 - you can kind of take that out and it
74:14 - still looks fine to me okay I like to
74:16 - just simplify it if we don't need
74:18 - something just take it out
74:20 - okay cool so search icon is looking good
74:25 - search is looking
74:27 - good yeah to me this is looking great
74:31 - okay you're making great progress so far
74:33 - I'm really proud of you now what we're
74:35 - going to do is we're going to actually
74:36 - turn that search icon into a file okay
74:40 - so I think that's going to be a lot
74:42 - better uh for you so let's go ahead and
74:44 - do that so I'll show you how to actually
74:46 - turn this into a
74:48 - file so inside of search icon what I'm
74:53 - going to do is I'm going to take this SV
74:55 - G right I'm going to cut it you need to
74:59 - cut
75:00 - it okay and um inside of my public
75:04 - images I'll create a new
75:07 - file and we're going to call it search-
75:11 - icon.svg just like so now inside of here
75:15 - I'm going to paste that SVG code okay so
75:19 - now notice that my search icon is not
75:22 - there
75:23 - anymore makes sense
75:26 - now what I'm going to do instead in my
75:29 - header I'm just going to replace all
75:31 - that SVG garbage code that I had I'm
75:34 - just going to replace that with this
75:36 - image and I'm just going to go search
75:40 - icon.svg like so and
75:43 - Tada we got that icon right there okay
75:47 - this is also highlights to you how you
75:51 - can actually turn that into a file all
75:54 - right has a nice little touch right
75:56 - there great um now let's start adding
76:00 - things to our Navar okay and we're going
76:03 - to start making progress on that all
76:06 - right so now let's style our Navar okay
76:11 - and let's make it look pretty Pretty
76:13 - Ricky Ricky all right here we go so I'm
76:17 - going to jump inside of my
76:19 - headers and uh we're going to add nav
76:22 - okay and we're going to add nav right
76:24 - underneath this search so give me a nav
76:27 - component just like this please and
76:29 - let's just go ahead and say nav menus
76:32 - now we're going to go ahead in our
76:35 - styling and we're just going to say con
76:37 - nav styled nav like this okay and uh
76:42 - we're going to go inside of here get a
76:44 - little margin left get a little bit of
76:46 - uh uh okay that's looking good display
76:50 - block beautiful got nav menus showing up
76:53 - on the top right hand side side that
76:55 - looks good uh of course let's add in a
76:58 - media query for phones 768 pixels mobile
77:02 - devices in general and let's say hey if
77:06 - you're on mobile give me a fixed
77:07 - position on this nav and give me a left
77:10 - of zero bottom of
77:13 - zero background white and of course give
77:18 - me a width of a 100% okay so there we go
77:23 - beautiful that's what it looks like on a
77:25 - mobile device now okay Pretty Ricky
77:28 - Ricky okay cool full screen this
77:32 - thing so some of the nav menu items
77:35 - seems like they're now coming to the
77:37 - bottom which is fine okay we ain't got a
77:40 - problem with that right do you got a
77:43 - problem with that cuz I don't have a
77:45 - problem with that okay so you should
77:47 - neither all right let's keep rocking and
77:50 - rolling all right so we got the nav done
77:53 - now let's go ahead and add home home to
77:55 - the nav menu so first things first let's
77:57 - grab our
77:59 - image okay let's take that image and I'm
78:02 - going to add the nav home image right
78:05 - there all right so this is our image now
78:08 - let's go inside of our header JS file
78:12 - and inside of our header JS we're going
78:14 - to do a couple of things so first things
78:16 - first let's actually wrap the nav
78:19 - actually not wrap the nav bar but inside
78:21 - of the nav bar I'm going to what I'm
78:23 - going to do is I'm going to delete where
78:24 - it says nav menus so delete that and
78:27 - instead I'm going to make a new
78:29 - component that says nav list wrap just
78:31 - like this I'm going to tab that and I'm
78:34 - going to hit enter and then I'm going to
78:36 - make another component inside of that's
78:37 - called NAB list hit tab then hit enter
78:40 - and inside of that let's make an a tag
78:43 - um and inside of that a tag actually
78:47 - here's what we'll do okay we don't need
78:48 - an ah ref for this okay we don't need
78:52 - that uh but we do need this thing tag
78:55 - wrapped up in an a tag so let's go here
78:58 - and inside of here let's add an image
79:01 - and for that image we're going to go
79:02 - images with the nav home.svg like that
79:06 - okay that's the one that we put in our
79:07 - SVG file so what it should look like is
79:11 - you got your nav bar you got your nav
79:14 - list inside of that and you got your nav
79:16 - uh I'm sorry not nav list excuse me
79:21 - nav have your nav list inside of there
79:24 - okay okay so that's looking good now
79:27 - it's complaining hey it's not defined
79:30 - okay no worries let's go ahead and
79:32 - Define this so let's go ahead and do
79:36 - first of all const nav list WP okay and
79:41 - equal styled UL it's going to be an
79:44 - unordered list and let's leave it like
79:46 - this then let's go here and we're going
79:48 - to have our nav list and this is going
79:51 - to be a styled bullet points uh
79:54 - [Music]
79:56 - okay here we go oh my bad let's put the
80:00 - Tilda Tilda at the end of it good good
80:03 - good good good good so now all we see is
80:05 - this bullet point right here that's okay
80:08 - because that's what we expected okay um
80:11 - now we're going to make it mean
80:13 - something in a second by doing our
80:15 - styling so inside of our nav list wrap
80:18 - let's go ahead and do this so display
80:20 - Flex inside of here we're going to flex
80:23 - wrap do
80:25 - no wrap and then let's do list style
80:29 - type none okay let's open this up and
80:33 - now because we did list style none we
80:35 - don't have that little dot
80:37 - there um that we were getting so that's
80:40 - fine now inside of nav list let's start
80:44 - doing let's enable display
80:47 - flex and align items let's make them
80:51 - centered okay and now let's make a a
80:55 - style our link tags and uh let's give it
80:59 - a little bit of styling okay so first of
81:00 - all we're going to say line items in the
81:02 - center background let's make it
81:05 - transparent I'm using Vim so you'll see
81:08 - a lot of jks happening there that's my
81:10 - shortcut for getting out of the mode and
81:13 - uh let's go Direction column and I'll
81:15 - show you why that's important uh later
81:18 - okay so column cool let's go font size
81:23 - 12 pixel
81:26 - font weight 400 okay just hang in with
81:32 - me there it's going to make sense I
81:35 - promise my child I promise my child this
81:38 - is going to make sense all right just
81:41 - hang in there for me pal justify content
81:45 - it's going to be Center and Lon hot
81:48 - we're going to give it a 1.5 cuz why not
81:53 - okay and uh let's give it a Min height
81:57 - of 52 pixel and a Min width of 80 pixels
82:04 - like
82:05 - so and uh position of relative okay and
82:10 - of course you know my style I do not
82:14 - like text decorations and the underlines
82:17 - that I sometimes normally get okay so
82:22 - none is going to be fine by me let's put
82:25 - that there okay and now just a couple of
82:29 - last things we're going to do let me
82:30 - just make sure that our nav list is
82:32 - right so we got our nav list nav
82:35 - home.svg
82:38 - m
82:39 - a nav list WP we got our nav list inside
82:43 - of that we got our a tags great okay
82:47 - let's keep on rocking and rolling whoops
82:50 - okay whoop okay my bad so this na home
82:55 - is going to be inside of images okay
82:57 - unlike me being an idiot that I am I put
83:00 - it not inside of images so of course I
83:02 - didn't have access to this okay here we
83:05 - go it's right there okay cool um so
83:10 - sorry there's tons of mysterious code
83:12 - and you're probably like what the hell's
83:13 - going on we don't need the cursor
83:15 - pointer we can get rid of that okay cool
83:18 - okay so now a lot of this is going to
83:21 - make sense all right so you saw when I
83:24 - took away line item Center watch it
83:26 - became so huge and massive right that's
83:29 - what she said but when I take it away
83:32 - and I hit save it's gone all right also
83:35 - this is what the media query part is
83:37 - doing all right let me remove all these
83:39 - lines of code so you and I can be on the
83:41 - same page cuz I coded just a little bit
83:44 - ahead of you but now we're back so no
83:46 - worries um let me just close this parent
83:49 - here okay and we're just going to code
83:52 - this thing up together okay so hit save
83:56 - um and if I hit this now we can see this
83:59 - icon right there okay beautiful mystery
84:04 - solved now inside of this a tag let's go
84:07 - span and uh let's give it a little color
84:11 - all right and uh we're going to give it
84:13 - this color okay so boom there we go
84:18 - that's good and where is this going to
84:20 - show up you might be asking here's where
84:22 - that's going to show up okay so inside
84:23 - of our let's go go to our navis
84:25 - component now inside of our navis
84:27 - component you see that we have added
84:29 - this a tag well what we want to add
84:32 - inside of that a tag is not just an
84:35 - image but actually a span tag as well
84:38 - that says home okay so like that the a
84:42 - link contains an image and a span tag
84:46 - called home so now this is what it
84:48 - should be looking like we got home right
84:50 - there okay and when we go to phone
84:54 - screen screen right we got home at the
84:56 - bottom which is pretty freaking cool how
84:58 - the media query Works magically and
85:02 - makes that happen Okay uh media query
85:06 - makes that happen at the bottom right
85:08 - like for example if I change that to top
85:11 - is going to make that happen at the top
85:13 - but we don't want that at the top we
85:14 - want it at the bottom okay there we
85:17 - go cool so now let's style that span tag
85:21 - right but the color home now has that
85:24 - little like grayish color that you can
85:26 - see let's go display flex and uh let's
85:30 - align items of course
85:33 - Center okay so that's just going to make
85:36 - sure that the text is vertically aligned
85:41 - how we want it now let's get out of this
85:43 - span tag and we're going to add in a
85:45 - media query and I'm just going to say
85:48 - hey my Max uh width should be that which
85:52 - is meaning a mobile device or a tablet
85:55 - or something of that nature and let's
85:57 - give it a in width of 70 pixels okay and
86:02 - then let's get out of let's get out of
86:05 - all of that and on Hover what I wanted
86:09 - to do is the following and on active
86:12 - here's also what I wanted to do okay the
86:16 - a tag specifically to the a tag on Hover
86:19 - here's what I want to happen and
86:21 - specifically does a span tag on Hover or
86:24 - active inside of the a tag I wanted to
86:28 - get just a slight color
86:31 - change okay all right now you can get
86:35 - lost in how it's nested it can get kind
86:37 - of weird but um it's a nice little touch
86:41 - okay watch this when I hover over this
86:43 - home Watch What Happens boom it's very
86:47 - very subtle just a very subtle shift
86:50 - okay that's all that's happening there
86:52 - so just a side note if you're you're
86:54 - watching this video right now there's a
86:56 - lot of weird things that you can kind of
86:58 - get tripped up on especially how things
87:00 - are nested inside of one another so like
87:03 - be on the lookout for that and just be
87:05 - careful when you're going through this
87:07 - right because for example here right
87:10 - it's the on Hover and on it being active
87:13 - inside of the a tag and inside of the
87:17 - span tag that's inside of the a tag have
87:20 - this color happen Okay so sometimes you
87:22 - can get lost very quickly and easily so
87:24 - just be on the lookout for that all
87:26 - right so now let's add um nav menus like
87:30 - a like the home menu that we added but
87:32 - we're going to add all of the rest of
87:34 - them meaning um I want to now add um all
87:38 - of these ones here my network jobs
87:40 - messaging yada y yada okay and so let's
87:44 - start working on that well for a couple
87:46 - of things we're going to need need all
87:48 - these nav items so we already did nav
87:50 - home so we don't need that anymore but
87:52 - we're going to need nav job
87:55 - messaging Network notifications and work
87:58 - so I'm going to hold shift click here
88:01 - select all of these and drop them inside
88:05 - of my images all right now that it's
88:07 - inside of my images I'm simply going to
88:11 - go to uh the top of my file header JS
88:15 - file let's go to our nav list and um all
88:20 - I'm going to do is I'm just going to
88:21 - keep on adding more nav list so for
88:23 - example example here I'm going to select
88:26 - this nav list component and I'm going to
88:29 - do the following okay so this is just be
88:31 - careful on this as you're following me
88:34 - I'm going to hit like I'm going to copy
88:36 - this entire component okay copy the
88:39 - entire component and then all I'm going
88:41 - to do is just replicate it couple of
88:43 - more times paste paste paste paste okay
88:50 - and how many icons are there let's go
88:52 - check 1 2 three four five okay maybe six
88:58 - but I think it's five if I'm not
89:01 - mistaken okay it worked on message UPS
89:03 - yeah so I think I'm fine pasting it five
89:06 - times um now let's go and start giving
89:09 - them those names so we have nav Dome now
89:13 - this one is going to be nav Dash uh jobs
89:17 - I imagine actually nav Das Network okay
89:20 - let's see what the first one is um in
89:22 - the completed version we have Network
89:26 - jobs okay so the next one is going to be
89:29 - jobs and then after jobs it's going to
89:32 - be nav Das messaging and after nav Das
89:36 - messaging is going to be nav Das
89:39 - notifications like so now you can see on
89:43 - the mobile version oh so nice looks so
89:47 - good on a mobile device let me actually
89:49 - move my face a little bit out of here so
89:51 - you can see that like wow am I
89:54 - pretending to look down right wow that
89:57 - looks
90:00 - amazing okay so there you go that is
90:03 - beautiful and when I go full screen I
90:06 - see them all up there okay and now I
90:09 - want to change what it says so for
90:11 - example where it says um home leave that
90:15 - as is but the span tag inside of the nav
90:18 - Network well we're going to go ahead and
90:20 - change that and we're going to say my
90:23 - network
90:24 - okay we're going to go to the jobs one
90:26 - and we're going to change that and we're
90:29 - going to change that to just
90:31 - jobs okay the one below that we're just
90:35 - going to change that to messaging and
90:37 - the one below that uh we're going to
90:39 - change that to Notifications okay so now
90:42 - in mobile device it is looking great and
90:45 - uh let's go full screen it's looking
90:47 - pretty freaking great that's exactly
90:50 - what we're looking for so our Navar is
90:53 - now starting to look really really good
90:56 - that makes me really happy so let's
90:58 - continue going forward and now add the
91:01 - activation functionality to this entire
91:04 - thing okay so how I'm going to do that
91:07 - is inside of nav list let's go where we
91:11 - have nav list and uh what I'm going to
91:13 - do is I'm going to do something special
91:17 - okay and I'm just going to do this to
91:18 - the home one none of the other ones for
91:20 - now okay I'm just going to kind of
91:22 - hardcode it inside of the home one and
91:25 - the functionality we're now adding is
91:27 - you see how this home one here is active
91:30 - right but these ones look like they're
91:31 - not active let's so we're going to add
91:34 - that styling to our app so let's go
91:37 - ahead and do that okay so navash uh nav
91:42 - list and to this nav list I'm going to
91:44 - add class name and I'm just going to
91:47 - call it
91:48 - active Okay and simply all we're going
91:51 - to do now is we're going to go and
91:53 - inside our nav list
91:57 - wrap okay so let's go inside to our nav
92:00 - list
92:01 - wrap right here okay and uh under our
92:06 - navis WP we're just going to add The
92:08 - Styling so we're going to do active so
92:10 - for our active class do the following
92:12 - for the span tag and right after that
92:15 - we're going to just do content blank
92:19 - whoops that's fun cool transform scale
92:23 - SC of X I don't know why it does that
92:27 - one oky doie and uh simply then border
92:31 - we're going to give it a border bottom
92:34 - of two pixels solid and let's go white-
92:39 - FFF cool okay so we're working on this
92:47 - functionality dope uh bottom I'm going
92:49 - to give it a zero top uh left zero
92:54 - position absolute position misspelled
93:00 - position
93:02 - okay give it a 200 millisecond ease in
93:06 - and
93:07 - out and I'll give it a border color
93:11 - of like
93:14 - this okay so now we have this going on
93:18 - here so now boom there we go I just had
93:22 - to hit refresh
93:24 - okay and there we go we got home it's
93:26 - going active when I hover over it that's
93:29 - exactly what we want and even on Mobile
93:31 - screen I can see home has that like nice
93:34 - little underline and um you know that's
93:36 - kind of what I expect to see on the on
93:39 - the home um you know the mobile app the
93:44 - mobile version of all of this all right
93:47 - so let's keep on going all right so now
93:50 - let's go ahead and add um add user nav
93:54 - menu and add work nav menu okay so we're
93:57 - going to add a couple of more things so
94:00 - for example here we have a user menu and
94:03 - then here we have a work menu okay
94:05 - looking thing so let's go ahead and add
94:08 - those two as well so first things first
94:10 - we're going to need the down icon that
94:13 - little tiny icon right there it's a
94:16 - little bit hard to see but it's that
94:18 - icon right there okay so we're going to
94:20 - need that um the other thing actually
94:23 - you know what let's just throw that into
94:24 - the images first going to need that the
94:27 - other thing we're going to need is the
94:28 - nav work menu so let's go nav dasw work
94:32 - boom going to need that um oh we already
94:36 - have that that's fine and then the other
94:38 - thing we're going to need is a user um
94:42 - SVG okay there we go there it
94:46 - is okay okay so now that you have all
94:49 - the images let's go inside of our header
94:51 - and start adding them okay so let's go
94:54 - ahead and create these components as
94:56 - well by the way so I'm going to go all
94:59 - the way under nav list but a within nav
95:03 - list wrap so right under the nav list
95:06 - ending let's go ahead and add user
95:10 - component okay and then right underneath
95:14 - that we're going to add our work
95:16 - component okay so these are the two
95:17 - components we're going to have now
95:19 - within our user component let's go ahead
95:21 - and add a couple of things so I'm going
95:23 - to add a a tag but I don't need an ah
95:26 - ref for this either I just need to
95:28 - borrow the link tag styling and inside
95:32 - of this a tag I'm going to need an image
95:34 - and I'm going to use the user.
95:37 - SVG okay like
95:39 - so um right underneath this a tag right
95:45 - underneath this image what I'm going to
95:47 - need is a
95:50 - span that's going to just say me
95:54 - okay and right underneath that me I'm
95:56 - going to need another image and I'm
95:59 - going to give it the drop down
96:02 - menu okay so far it makes complete sense
96:05 - because you got the user image right
96:07 - underneath that you got the drop down
96:08 - image okay so that's looking good now
96:12 - we're good with this part let's go
96:13 - inside of the work part work work work
96:16 - work
96:18 - work so now let's go and add a couple of
96:21 - things so let's go to a tag again we're
96:23 - probably not going to need any of the
96:25 - other things let's add an image inside
96:27 - of the work tag and we're going to add
96:29 - in the work image okay nav dork. SVG
96:32 - cool and also we want to add um a span
96:37 - tag inside of here and uh we'll give it
96:40 - we'll say work and within that span
96:43 - tag okay within that span tag I'm going
96:46 - to add another image and uh we're going
96:48 - to give it images down icon.svg like so
96:54 - okay cool now it's complaining hey user
96:57 - is not defined work is not defined hey
96:59 - no problem I like when work is not
97:01 - defined cuz that's how I live my life as
97:03 - a CEO let's go all right so we're going
97:07 - to do create new styling for the
97:11 - component all right so there we go and
97:14 - now I'm basically going to add my styled
97:17 - components okay that's all I'm going to
97:19 - do so I'm going to borrow my styling
97:22 - from our nav list okay that's how you
97:25 - can borrow styling from something else
97:27 - and uh for my work I'm going to borrow
97:30 - my styling from the user okay that's
97:32 - kind of nice let's just hit save for
97:35 - now um oh let's do Style with a small S
97:40 - I
97:40 - believe okay user is not
97:44 - defined okay fair enough fair enough
97:47 - we'll Define it there we go okay so on
97:50 - the mobile screen now you get this funny
97:52 - looking thing at the bottom right okay
97:53 - if you're not seeing it I'm just going
97:55 - to move this here going to get this
97:57 - funny looking image the bottom
98:00 - right and if I go full screen you'll see
98:03 - me and you'll see work so that's cool
98:07 - but that looks ugly so we're going to
98:09 - fix that okay so let's go here to user
98:13 - and do a couple of things and basically
98:15 - we're going to say hey the SVG inside of
98:18 - this a tag look we got to do something
98:21 - with this thing all right it's it's uh
98:23 - just unacceptable so let's start off
98:25 - with width okay let's try to control the
98:29 - width of this link
98:31 - tag okay and then uh let's also try to
98:34 - control the Border uh
98:39 - radius okay 50 5050 can go 50/50
98:45 - with okay let's see hopefully that does
98:48 - something if it doesn't do something um
98:50 - I got another idea in mind okay so
98:52 - another thing thing we can do is uh
98:55 - let's go let's grab the image tag inside
98:58 - of here and give that a width of 50 24
99:02 - pixels beautiful so now you see the
99:04 - image is actually quiet quite
99:07 - small all right so that's controlling
99:10 - the image that's good let's give it a
99:12 - height of 24
99:14 - pixels all right cool cool
99:18 - cool and uh now let's give it a border
99:21 - radius of 50% that's it's going to add
99:24 - that nice little circular effect to it
99:26 - so you can already see it's starting to
99:28 - have that nice little circular effect
99:30 - that's
99:32 - great and let's go span
99:36 - tag and uh we're just going to align
99:39 - items in the center all right cuz that's
99:43 - just that's just how we like to do
99:46 - things around here all right and now
99:48 - inside of my
99:50 - work all I'm going to do because it's
99:52 - already borrowing tons of styling we're
99:54 - just going to give it a certain
99:58 - border okay give it the nice little nice
100:02 - little color so there it is and when I
100:05 - highlight it looks a certain way we got
100:07 - the drop down we got the me with the big
100:09 - fat Arrow this is pretty freaking cool
100:13 - it's looking great okay okay great work
100:17 - young Padawan so far we're looking good
100:20 - we're looking smooth we're looking clean
100:23 - so so let's just keep on rocking and
100:25 - rolling through this thing okay now
100:26 - we're going to add sign out
100:28 - functionality
100:29 - okay so let's go into um let's go inside
100:35 - our user because that's where sign in
100:38 - functionality is going to be added so my
100:41 - user is right here okay let's go right
100:44 - down there right underneath the a tag
100:46 - ending and I'll add the sign out
100:49 - component okay now this component before
100:53 - we rebuild it this is going to be this
100:55 - component right here when I hover
100:57 - over all right it gives me that sign out
101:00 - option that's what this component is
101:02 - going to
101:04 - be all right so that's what that
101:06 - component is going to look like okay so
101:07 - now let's go ahead and just build it out
101:09 - now inside of my sign out um I want to
101:13 - add an a tag again I don't need the ah
101:16 - ref and um all I'm going to have it do
101:20 - is say sign out and again I'm just
101:22 - adding the h tag to borrow the styling
101:25 - that I have added to it okay so hit save
101:28 - let's go down and let's create our
101:31 - styled component for sign out const sign
101:34 - out okay and we're just going to do
101:37 - styled div let's leave it empty for now
101:40 - and let's go inside of here let's uh
101:45 - let's go back let's hit
101:47 - refresh
101:49 - cool okay so we have something showing
101:52 - up that's a good sign now inside of
101:55 - inside of our sign out we're going
101:58 - to
102:00 - Let's uh go ahead and do position
102:03 - absolute let's go top by 45
102:09 - pixels okay and um I'm going to pass on
102:13 - the drop shadow because again it's one
102:15 - of those like weird looking ones I'm
102:17 - just going to keep it simple here so
102:21 - sign out creates a box around we'll give
102:25 - it a white
102:26 - background and now let's give it a
102:29 - border radius of
102:32 - uh this okay so now sign now it has a
102:37 - little border radius around it right
102:39 - there that you can see that looks
102:42 - cool and under here I'll give it a width
102:46 - of 100
102:47 - pixels okay and a height of 40
102:52 - pixels okay okay so now the sign out is
102:55 - starting to get under control and not
102:57 - looking as crazy give it a font size of
103:00 - 16 pixels and transition
103:06 - duration this is going to give it that
103:08 - little effect when it comes up which
103:10 - it's not going to do right now but in a
103:12 - second we will add that so then it'll
103:14 - look much nicer text align and let's
103:18 - align it in the
103:19 - center display none
103:23 - that looks
103:24 - good okay so it won't display anything
103:28 - and then it'll come up on
103:31 - Hover okay so now let's go inside of our
103:35 - user which borrows from our style
103:38 - component uh Navas component so inside
103:41 - of user we're going to create a new
103:44 - thing and they're basically going to say
103:45 - on Hover do the following for the
103:50 - user all right now we're going to select
103:53 - use this fancy
103:56 - selector to select our sign out
103:59 - component okay and style
104:02 - it align item
104:05 - Center okay and I'm going to justify
104:08 - content inside of the center all right
104:11 - now we're having reference error so
104:13 - what's going on here cannot access sign
104:15 - out before initialization interesting so
104:19 - what we need to do is um we need to move
104:21 - this code up I believe let's take this
104:24 - sign out code
104:26 - and um Move It
104:29 - Up Up Above
104:33 - user okay let's move it right
104:35 - there and uh we should be good nice we
104:39 - are
104:42 - good okay because yeah I couldn't
104:44 - reference sign out cuz it wasn't defined
104:46 - yet defined yet so we just make sure we
104:48 - Define it right
104:50 - before Okay so so let's go back now when
104:55 - I hover over me you can actually see
104:58 - this drop down of sign out showing up
105:01 - that's a really good sign that's what
105:02 - you should be seeing right now okay dope
105:04 - so looking good so far now let's keep on
105:08 - going with this thing okay so we're now
105:10 - going to add a container and I'm going
105:12 - to basically add another component using
105:16 - styled components okay so let's go with
105:19 - that and we're going to add the hiring
105:21 - and hurry part which looks like this add
105:23 - right here right there all right that
105:26 - gives it also a LinkedIn esque feeling
105:28 - we're going to go ahead and add that now
105:31 - cool so let's go inside of Home JS all
105:35 - right and we're going to add that here
105:37 - so um going to be doing a lot of stuff
105:40 - so inside of this return okay let's just
105:42 - open this return uh create a container
105:45 - component inside this container
105:47 - component create a section component and
105:50 - then let's create an
105:51 - H5 and again let's create an a tag but
105:57 - uh um without the ah refs
106:04 - okay like so just to borrow the styling
106:08 - and then basically what I'm going to do
106:10 - is um just type in hiring in a hurry
106:14 - question
106:17 - mark all right and uh just like that
106:21 - okay and then underneath this H5 I'm
106:24 - going to make a P
106:27 - tag and
106:29 - um basically I'm just going to say find
106:33 - talented Pros in record time with upwork
106:38 - and keep business moving and put a
106:42 - period there
106:44 - save okay so I have a section inside of
106:47 - which I have an H5 and a paragraph tag
106:51 - cool now let's go ahead and just style
106:53 - this and um a lot of these are very
106:56 - common stylings that we have already
106:58 - kind of done so I'm going to like go
107:00 - through this much faster so our
107:03 - container is going to be I'm going to
107:06 - just keep it empty for now and start off
107:08 - with that I'll have my content is going
107:11 - to be style div we'll keep it empty for
107:13 - now we'll have section and um I think
107:17 - I'm going to make that section okay
107:20 - style section and again we'll keep it
107:23 - empty for now so it doesn't complain and
107:26 - uh there you go okay so now we have that
107:28 - text but you saw it was a little hard to
107:30 - see right it's kind of up here hiding
107:34 - okay and we basically need to push it
107:37 - down that's what we're going to do right
107:39 - now we're going to push it
107:40 - down so inside of my container I will go
107:45 - ahead and do give some padding to the
107:47 - top 52 pixels so now boom it just pushed
107:52 - it down and now I can finally see
107:54 - it let's give it a Max width of
107:58 - 100% like
108:00 - so okay cool and then um what I'm going
108:04 - to do inside of
108:07 - content are let's give it a Max width of
108:13 - 128
108:14 - this okay let's go
108:18 - down and I'm going to do margin
108:20 - left Auto and also we're going to give
108:24 - it a margin
108:27 - right um and we're going to do
108:31 - auto
108:32 - okay cool and uh inside of
108:38 - section um let's do Min height
108:42 - 50 all right so let's give it
108:45 - that 50
108:47 - pixels let's give it a padding of 16
108:51 - pixels
108:53 - uh box sizing let's do content box on
108:58 - this
109:00 - cool okay so that just centered Center
109:04 - aligned it all right now it's perfectly
109:08 - smack in the middle of the
109:09 - center uh let's give it a text
109:12 - decoration and we will actually give it
109:14 - an
109:15 - underline okay kind of like an actual
109:18 - link we'll uh enable Flex on this and
109:22 - justify I content to be in Center
109:28 - okay there we
109:30 - go okay so we'll do media queries here
109:33 - in just a second don't worry for H5 I'm
109:37 - going to give it a special um styling
109:41 - let's go ahead and do this okay give it
109:45 - a little blue for hiring in a hurry
109:48 - that's that right
109:50 - there okay and the a inside of
109:54 - here
109:56 - um let's give it a
109:59 - 700
110:03 - beautiful okay let's get in outside of
110:06 - the H5 tag
110:08 - now and uh let's go into the P tag and
110:11 - style that and I'm going to say hey give
110:13 - me 14 font size
110:17 - 14 and uh let's also now do some
110:20 - coloring on this
110:24 - okay great G gives me makes it a little
110:27 - bit darker and uh let's uh make the text
110:33 - Bolder right so 600 makes it pretty
110:37 - bold and then let's get outside of the P
110:39 - tag and finally let's give it a media
110:42 - query so I'm going to go Max
110:44 - with
110:46 - 768 again mobile
110:49 - devices where you at mobile devices
110:52 - direction we're going to give it column
110:55 - and then padding of course will be 0 by
110:59 - 5 pixels okay boom there we have it that
111:03 - is looking gorgeous okay beautiful
111:07 - hopefully you got to that with me and
111:08 - let's keep rocking and rolling all right
111:10 - just to blow some of your uh some of
111:13 - yours Minds okay so to flex on what the
111:16 - this uh media query does right so for
111:19 - example imagine if I wanted to make this
111:21 - red every time it was a mobile device
111:23 - but like if I went full screen uh it
111:26 - made it um it made it black okay uh so
111:31 - what I can do is I can actually select
111:33 - cuz this is a P tag right here so I can
111:36 - actually select this by doing that okay
111:39 - and then how would I make it red think
111:41 - about that how would I make it red all
111:44 - right so color red save okay so now
111:49 - notice that it's in red but when I go
111:51 - full screen mode desktop mode now it's
111:54 - black okay so it's basically
111:57 - saying this again is saying mobile
111:59 - devices do the following now I can also
112:02 - you know if I wanted to do something
112:03 - like font size make the font size 100x
112:07 - on mobile the font size would be crazy
112:09 - in red and on full screen it would
112:11 - actually be completely normal that's
112:13 - kind of crazy it's almost like you have
112:14 - two different apps right that's pretty
112:16 - freaking cool so um I'm just going to
112:19 - select this P tag and uh remove move it
112:23 - and we should be back to our
112:25 - normal uh healthy looking app all right
112:30 - now what we're going to do is basically
112:32 - we're going to start to add some of
112:34 - these parts so for example in the
112:36 - finished version you see we have um we
112:39 - have these three things happening over
112:42 - here okay so this is like one this is
112:46 - two and this is three and this is our
112:49 - left side right this is our middle and
112:52 - then this is our right side okay so
112:55 - basically what I'm going to do at this
112:57 - point is I'm going to divide up the page
112:59 - in these three things and I'm going to
113:01 - use actually grid uh layout instead of
113:05 - flexbox layout to do this okay so this
113:08 - going to be really cool let's go ahead
113:10 - and make it happen
113:13 - pal okay so let me go to our our app
113:18 - cool let's go to home JS okay cool we're
113:21 - already here all right so let's go to um
113:24 - let's go right underneath section and
113:27 - right underneath section I'm going to
113:28 - add my component called layout and
113:31 - inside of here I'm going to make a div
113:33 - and call it left side here this is going
113:36 - to I'm going to put Main and another div
113:40 - and we'll just say right side
113:44 - okay and again it's complaining I don't
113:46 - know what layout is but this time you
113:49 - know what we need to do okay what do we
113:50 - need to do we need to go go
113:54 - downtown and style that damn component
113:58 - const
114:00 - layout style
114:02 - div all right
114:05 - save and then let's go
114:07 - here okay so right now you got left side
114:10 - Main and right side not exactly where we
114:14 - want it but it's a good
114:16 - start and uh here's what we're going to
114:18 - do I'm going to start with display grid
114:22 - okay well that didn't do anything it's
114:24 - okay buddy hold on hang in
114:27 - there all right we're going to call them
114:30 - the the areas we're going to call them
114:31 - this left side Main and right side okay
114:36 - boom so it's divided up into three areas
114:40 - all right so now what I want to do is I
114:42 - want to Define how many columns I want
114:45 - right so we're going to go ahead and do
114:48 - that now so let's go here uh and I'm
114:51 - going to give it columns and I'm just
114:53 - going to say min max give
114:55 - me this
114:57 - okay right
114:59 - there let's
115:01 - go
115:03 - okay and always like click and watch
115:06 - what it does right so right now it's
115:08 - doing something really really bizarre
115:10 - but watch what happens once we're done
115:12 - with the whole freaking
115:13 - thing okay I don't know why I'm going
115:16 - autocomplete always act so
115:18 - freaking weird okay let's go here here
115:23 - min max 300
115:26 - pixels okay so let's go
115:28 - here um min max
115:32 - 05 okay there we go so now they're like
115:35 - overlapping a little bit but we got left
115:37 - side Main and right side kind of like
115:40 - how I want them but uh a couple of
115:43 - things I want to tell them I want to
115:44 - tell them hey I want to have a column
115:46 - gap of 25 pixels okay cool and um
115:52 - another thing I want is I want a row
115:55 - gap of 25 pixels okay let's make sure we
116:00 - keep refreshing cuz sometimes The
116:01 - Styling acts a little weird and uh grid
116:06 - template row let's go Auto on this
116:11 - thing
116:14 - cool
116:15 - okay and U margin I want to go 25 pixels
116:21 - cool so that gave it some margin from
116:23 - the top great and then let's go ahead
116:26 - and again add our media query so what is
116:30 - that mean that means
116:32 - that uh mobile device we want specific
116:36 - things to happen Okay display
116:40 - Flex all right Flex direction we're
116:44 - going to make it go column instead of
116:46 - like row by row right so for example
116:49 - here it's going to go like multiple
116:51 - columns
116:53 - okay uh when I go into this now
116:57 - it's like that each row is a column okay
117:01 - just one column per
117:02 - row and um padding we're going to go
117:06 - zero by five pixels like that cool so we
117:10 - gave it a little push and a shove from
117:12 - touching the screen so much on the left
117:14 - hand side okay and uh with that said
117:18 - we're looking pretty good and that
117:20 - allowed us to divide the page into three
117:24 - and you know honestly I'm just going to
117:26 - comment that line out cuz that line is
117:28 - giving me the creeps with that said this
117:31 - is looking good and let's keep on
117:32 - rocking and rolling okay so so far
117:35 - looking good um now let's actually go
117:38 - ahead and we've divided the page now
117:41 - we're actually going to start making the
117:43 - main and the left and the right
117:46 - components okay so let's go ahead and
117:49 - start doing that uh we're going to try
117:51 - to keep it pretty freaking simple and
117:54 - pretty pretty um empty for now okay so
117:58 - let's go ahead go inside of components
118:01 - and create a new file and we're going to
118:03 - call this file left side.
118:08 - JS um and in left side
118:10 - JS create another component okay called
118:14 - uh inside of components call it main.js
118:17 - and let's also create another component
118:19 - and we'll call it right side. JS okay
118:22 - okay then inside
118:24 - of uh left side just go ahead and do
118:28 - import styled from
118:31 - styled
118:33 - components okay and uh for left side
118:37 - we're going to do the
118:39 - following all right so let's fix this
118:41 - one because we made a little
118:44 - uh typo so just rename and all I'm just
118:48 - make it a small s okay there we go so uh
118:50 - complete constant left side I'm going to
118:53 - have props like this okay and uh return
118:57 - inside of the return we're just going to
118:59 - put a container and in that container
119:01 - just say the word left side like that
119:03 - that's fine okay
119:06 - and we're going to create the style
119:09 - component for this so it doesn't freak
119:12 - out and inside of here we'll do grid
119:15 - area and we'll go left side just like
119:19 - that okay and again export
119:23 - default left side cool so save save save
119:28 - save save now we're going to do this
119:30 - let's go to
119:32 - Main and um in main I'm going to paste
119:36 - that code and everywhere it says left
119:38 - side I'm just going to replace it with
119:40 - main that's it okay whoops so let's
119:46 - replace this with
119:48 - main
119:50 - okay and and let's replace that with
119:53 - main cool and
119:58 - this like
120:00 - that so wherever it says main replace it
120:04 - um and now copy main go to right side
120:07 - paste this code and everywhere it says
120:09 - main you know the drill by this point uh
120:13 - just replace right side replace main
120:17 - with right
120:18 - side
120:20 - okay like that okay and then just go hit
120:24 - save um
120:27 - cool and last thing we want to do is we
120:29 - want to go to home JS okay and under
120:34 - layout we want to replace all of these
120:37 - divs and remove them cuz we don't need
120:40 - that anymore instead we're just going to
120:43 - do left
120:45 - side all
120:47 - right and um make sure you autocomplete
120:50 - it because autocomplete will
120:52 - automatically import it for you as
120:55 - well uh why did it do left side like
120:58 - that oh
121:01 - because
121:03 - um okay well anyways it's it's left side
121:07 - with the small s like that okay we're
121:11 - also going to do main just like that
121:15 - close it and then we're also going to do
121:17 - right
121:19 - side make sure that when you write these
121:21 - three that you import these three as
121:26 - well um and now it's saying styled is
121:30 - not defined in any of them well what
121:34 - does that mean so let's go to left side
121:37 - and let's see what it's saying okay so
121:39 - lowercase the styled from styled
121:42 - components and that should be good to go
121:45 - I believe save go
121:48 - here uh make it styled with a small s
121:51 - save hit
121:53 - refresh and um yep that's looking great
121:57 - let's hit save like that
121:59 - cool so we're good so far and now let's
122:04 - actually add a art card component on the
122:07 - left hand side all right so let's add
122:10 - the art to the cards now so let's go
122:13 - ahead and do this okay so first things
122:15 - first I'm going to go to uh let's go to
122:18 - left side cuz that's where we're going
122:19 - to actually make this happen and I'm
122:21 - going to create um let's create a styled
122:25 - component and I'm going to
122:29 - um called Art card okay and let's
122:32 - actually get it started with something
122:35 - in here so instead of saying left side
122:38 - in there I'm going to do art card just
122:40 - like that all right and um within this
122:44 - I'm just going to say card okay kind of
122:47 - like that so you should have card here
122:49 - okay now inside of this we'll do text
122:53 - align and I'll do Center okay so boom
122:56 - there we go looking good so
122:59 - far
123:01 - um now let's go overflow hidden all
123:05 - right so it won't like bleed off the
123:08 - screen onto the
123:10 - sides okay there we
123:12 - go and
123:14 - um let's go background
123:18 - color Boom Like This
123:23 - give it a border radius of five
123:26 - pixels cool so now we starting to look
123:29 - like a card right
123:33 - um and we have that background right
123:36 - there and now the the the little radius
123:38 - is coming in that's clean and uh let's
123:41 - give it a little
123:44 - transition box Shadow
123:46 - 83
123:48 - milliseconds okay cool
123:51 - and now let's give it a position
123:54 - relative border I'm going to give it
123:57 - none okay and um I can give it a
124:01 - complicated looking box Shadow but I
124:04 - think I'm just going to pass on that for
124:06 - now so I'm actually going to add the Box
124:09 - uh Shadow because I think it does make
124:11 - it kind of look nice and so let's go
124:14 - ahead and do that okay I'm going to give
124:16 - it
124:17 - a
124:19 - um the only reason sometimes I want to
124:21 - skip it is cuz it looks like this
124:23 - mysterious code but again a lot of it is
124:26 - autogenerated um you know and even when
124:29 - you should I encourage you to use like
124:30 - online tools for things like box Shadow
124:32 - and stuff like that okay all right so
124:34 - now we got the art card let's go ahead
124:37 - and work on the user information so
124:39 - we're going to need a couple of things
124:41 - to make that happen all right so now
124:43 - you're going to need two photos SL SVG
124:45 - files we're going to need photo this one
124:47 - right here with the camera icon and
124:50 - we're also going to need this card uh
124:52 - background card okay so let's go ahead
124:54 - and uh take both of these and I'm going
124:58 - to um put them in my yoink okay just as
125:03 - a place a right a pit stop before I drop
125:06 - them into my images so boom just added
125:08 - them right there all right so now that
125:11 - we added those images uh let's go ahead
125:14 - and do something with them so I'm going
125:15 - to um am I in the left side already okay
125:18 - great I'm in the left side component
125:20 - already perfect now
125:22 - uh inside of my art card just so you
125:24 - have an idea what we're doing we're
125:26 - going to be building this thing out
125:27 - right here on the left hand side okay so
125:31 - let's go inside of our app that we're
125:33 - working on currently inside of our art
125:35 - card uh component remove where it says
125:37 - cart instead we're going to create a new
125:40 - component called user info all right I'm
125:43 - going to hit tab on this and inside of
125:45 - here I'm going to create a new component
125:47 - called background let's hit tab on that
125:50 - that should complete it and inside of
125:52 - this um actually let's uh kill the card
125:59 - background right there okay and so
126:03 - inside of user info I'm going to have
126:04 - card background I'm also going to have a
126:06 - a tag with no hre just so I can borrow
126:08 - the a
126:10 - styling and uh we're going to have photo
126:12 - which is going to be a component and
126:15 - then I'm going to have link just like
126:18 - this it's going to be another component
126:21 - and uh it's going to say welcome there
126:24 - okay and then I'm just going to end it
126:27 - so slash end just like that all right so
126:31 - I got user info and then in their card
126:34 - background and the a
126:36 - tag okay now right underneath this a tag
126:41 - I'm going to have another a tag again
126:44 - with the no
126:46 - hre okay just like this inside of this a
126:50 - tag I'm going to have add photo text
126:54 - component and that's just going to say
126:56 - add a photo just like that okay now
127:00 - there are tons of components that we
127:01 - need to go and make so let's get go
127:03 - ahead and get started it's like three or
127:06 - four maybe more so let's go user info
127:10 - and I'm just going to do style div let's
127:13 - leave it empty then we need card
127:16 - background um and I'm going to do
127:18 - something similar which is going to be
127:21 - Style div let's leave that empty let's
127:23 - go cons
127:25 - photo and let's go here let's leave that
127:29 - empty and then um let's go cons link for
127:35 - the link
127:36 - component and again this is it div we're
127:39 - going to leave it empty for now and add
127:43 - photo
127:45 - text okay let's leave that empty for now
127:48 - as well okay user info is not defined
127:51 - and boom welcome there add a photo
127:54 - that's what you should be seeing right
127:56 - now cool so now we're going to start
127:58 - adding all the styling in here so for
128:00 - user info let's get started with that so
128:05 - couple of things are going to be
128:05 - happening here we're going to give it a
128:07 - border bottom of one pixel
128:11 - solid okay there we go so that gave it a
128:14 - little nice little drop shadow here
128:16 - makes it look beautiful so it's a border
128:20 - bottom it didn't at the border anywhere
128:22 - else 12 pixel 12
128:25 - pixels by 16 pixels okay so now this is
128:31 - much more centered we have padding going
128:33 - left we get padding going this way and
128:34 - we got padding going that way okay so
128:37 - far so good let's go word wrap and we'll
128:40 - do break word
128:43 - cool and uh let's go ahead and
128:47 - um let go ahead and do this cool
128:52 - so sometimes some of this we might not
128:55 - need honestly but it's okay I'm going to
128:57 - leave it here word
128:59 - break uh
129:02 - break
129:03 - word
129:06 - cool okay so let's go ahead and uh let's
129:11 - keep on going okay inside of my card
129:17 - background we're going to now okay so
129:21 - first first of all we're going to add a
129:22 - background image to this okay so let's
129:24 - go background and give it a URL and
129:28 - that's going to
129:30 - be
129:32 - imagescard background.svg
129:36 - cool close it put a semicolon good hit
129:41 - refresh refresh cool so that image is
129:44 - not showing up but that image is going
129:46 - to start showing up in just a little bit
129:48 - so let's give it a background position
129:53 - Center let's go give it a background
129:56 - size of
129:57 - 462
129:59 - pixels let's go give it a height of 54
130:03 - pixels so now you can start to see that
130:05 - image show up and let's give it a margin
130:10 - of uh -12 -12 0 so now that card is
130:15 - starting to look pretty perfect pretty
130:19 - freaking perfect okay pretty and perfect
130:22 - there we
130:23 - go so card background we're good on okay
130:27 - now let's just go ahead and add photo in
130:29 - there so photo is going to require us to
130:31 - do a bit of styling but it's going to
130:34 - look so freaking beautiful when it's
130:35 - done so going to start off with not
130:37 - having any box Shadow uh for background
130:40 - image let's go ahead and choose the
130:43 - photo image so images I'm going to do
130:46 - /o.
130:48 - SVG okay now we're going to make this
130:51 - thing show up in just a second so let's
130:53 - give it a certain width let's also give
130:56 - it a certain height so now the image is
131:00 - showing up cool now we're going to start
131:02 - making it look
131:04 - better cool height I'm going to give it
131:07 - box sizing border
131:11 - box background clip content
131:17 - box
131:19 - background color let's go
131:22 - white okay background
131:26 - position center cool so that changed how
131:31 - the image was looking going to give it a
131:33 - background size of
131:37 - 60% beautiful and then we have
131:42 - um background repeat at no repeat
131:48 - actually cool so because we don't want
131:50 - it repeating over and over again we just
131:52 - want one
131:54 - camera and that's how we get it now
131:57 - let's go and do border and for Border
132:00 - we're going to do two pixels solid white
132:04 - clean okay margin let's give it a margin
132:08 - of 30 negative 38
132:10 - pixels Auto 12 pixel like that damn look
132:16 - at that one line of code and
132:19 - beautifully smacks that in the
132:22 - [Music]
132:23 - middle guys like isn't that beautiful
132:26 - when you have these little touches and
132:28 - they all keep adding on and then your
132:30 - front end
132:31 - just m just
132:35 - beautiful all right and then uh let's
132:38 - give it a border radius of
132:43 - 50% now we got it round nice and round
132:47 - just how we like
132:48 - it okay now let's go inside of our link
132:52 - and make that do good things let's go 16
132:56 - pixels for the font
132:58 - size line height will go
133:03 - 1.5 okay that added some uh line height
133:06 - to this
133:09 - okay let's go here and go color and
133:12 - we'll change the color just a little bit
133:15 - so we're going to go 0 0 0 0.9
133:23 - cool and then after that we're just
133:25 - going to choose the font way to be kind
133:27 - of boldish okay let's go 600 so welcome
133:31 - there
133:32 - boom a little bold man looks so nice
133:36 - right on the left hand side is looking
133:37 - beautiful when I go in this mode it
133:40 - looks great in Mobile you know most
133:43 - people get lazy on the mobile but not us
133:46 - we make sure that that mobile
133:49 - version is uh
133:52 - is looking clutch you know is it
133:54 - distracting when I'm in the center
133:57 - probably I'll just keep myself to the
133:58 - side for now okay all right so that that
134:03 - looks great okay and then U add photo to
134:06 - text at photo
134:09 - text let's go give it a color and let's
134:12 - start off with
134:14 - this okay cool we got a little blue
134:18 - action going on let's give uh some
134:20 - margin from the top so give it this
134:22 - little separation from welcome there
134:24 - right it was way too close and feeling a
134:26 - little uncomfortable and we got it out
134:28 - of there give it a little font size of
134:31 - 12 pixels line height uh again line
134:35 - height gives things some nice breathing
134:37 - room so it just does not hurt and then
134:41 - we'll give it a font weight of 400 makes
134:43 - it just a little bit Tad tad bit darker
134:47 - if we go 700 that's a little too much
134:49 - but 400 is just
134:52 - just right and just enough so perfect
134:54 - that's looking great now let's add a
134:56 - widget component inside of our art
135:00 - card okay so let's go ahead and do that
135:05 - now all right now let's work on our
135:08 - widget okay so first things first we're
135:10 - going to go inside of our uh left side

135:32 - going to create a div inside of that div
135:34 - I'm going to have uh some span tags so
135:39 - Spandex and this is going to say the
135:42 - first span tag is going to say
135:45 - connections and then the next span tag
135:48 - is going to say grow your network
135:51 - just like
135:52 - that okay now I need to close that a tag
135:56 - that's why it's
135:57 - complaining
135:59 - great and uh I need to actually add an
136:02 - SVG inside of that so what I'm going to
136:04 - do is I'm going to copy this SVG that

138:00 - source is going to be that SVG file that
138:05 - we talked that we just added okay and uh
138:08 - after where the widget ends we're going
138:10 - to add in another component called item
138:13 - within that we're going to have a span
138:15 - tag within that we're going to have
138:17 - another image or a image and that's

139:03 - just for you guys I didn't do a ASMR
139:05 - version okay cuz you guys didn't like
139:07 - that very much so let's go ahead and uh
139:10 - let's add in a widget just like this and
139:13 - we're going to do two things we're going
139:15 - to add in widget and we're going to add
139:17 - in item
139:19 - cool so widget component just in the
139:22 - start was going to be styled div I'm
139:25 - going to leave it empty and then also
139:28 - let's add in um for item okay let's go
139:33 - item is going to be a styled
139:36 - a and just start off with
139:39 - empty so let's put slash here by the way
139:43 - that was a little typo so boom slash not
139:46 - Dash cool so now both of the images
139:48 - should be here right there okay if I
139:50 - full screen this thing you should see
139:53 - them connections grow your network and
139:56 - we got both of our
139:58 - images right
140:01 - cool okay so let's go ahead all the way
140:04 - down and start styling this uh widget
140:07 - okay so that's going to take a second
140:09 - actually to style cuz there's a couple
140:11 - of things happening here let's go B
140:13 - border bottom one pixel
140:16 - solid all
140:19 - right beautiful
140:22 - uh let's add some padding to the top of
140:24 - this thing cool and let's add some
140:28 - padding to the bottom of this
140:31 - thing
140:32 - beautiful let's go
140:35 - ahead and uh style the a
140:40 - tags inside of this thing and I'm going
140:42 - to give it a text
140:44 - decoration of
140:46 - uh of
140:49 - none let's go to display Flex cuz we're
140:52 - going to need that justify
140:56 - content and I want to give it space
140:59 - between okay so you saw how this thing
141:02 - got pushed right that's kind of what we
141:04 - want this on the left side this on the
141:06 - right side and there's space in between
141:08 - that's why we write
141:10 - that align items
141:14 - Center and we're going to give it some
141:17 - padding cool
141:20 - okay so on Hover it gets darker and it
141:23 - kind of gets highlighted okay whoops my
141:26 - face is blocking pretty much
141:29 - everything
141:31 - great so when I
141:33 - hover boom boom looking pretty
141:37 - magnificent my
141:39 - friend uh background color on Hover we
141:43 - got some action going on okay now let's
141:46 - go under hover and let's do something
141:50 - okay so let's go display
141:52 - flex and we'll go flex Direction and
141:55 - we'll go
141:56 - column okay so connections and grow your
141:59 - network got written out on separate
142:01 - lines because this is a span tag this is
142:04 - a span tag and because of doing column
142:07 - they both got pushed onto their own
142:10 - columns let's go text align and we'll go
142:13 - left so now connections and grow your
142:16 - network are you know evened out more and
142:20 - within this let's uh style our span tags
142:24 - even further so let's go give it font
142:26 - size of 12 pixels a little bit
142:29 - smaller let's give it a line height of
142:35 - 1.33333 so we got some spacing going on
142:38 - in between some room to
142:40 - breathe it's like when I'm sleeping with
142:42 - my girlfriend and I just want to like
142:44 - not spoon for a second you know I'm
142:46 - basically giving a little line height in
142:48 - between cuz sometimes it just gets way
142:51 - too
142:52 - hot um first
142:55 - child uh AKA Mona first no I'm kidding
143:00 - all right here we go let's give it a
143:01 - color

143:42 - give
143:43 - it woo what happened here just like that
143:48 - okay there we go so now these styled
143:52 - things have certain ways of how they're
143:56 - colored okay so that's
143:59 - good and uh let's close out of all of
144:03 - this and then the last thing we want to
144:05 - do is we want to give certain styling to
144:07 - SVG hopefully that actually does
144:10 - something cool um so there we go so now
144:15 - this component is looking really
144:16 - beautiful I mean like look at it right
144:18 - on the left hand side connections grow
144:22 - your

144:44 - that we were going to do so let's go
144:47 - ahead and do that one okay where's item
144:49 - component it item component has the item
144:52 - icon so I imagine it's this one but
144:56 - hopefully we're not wrong let's
144:59 - go let's give it a border color whoops I
145:03 - mean technically that was correct
145:07 - code um okay
145:10 - that text align it to left I mean do we
145:15 - even have text in there oh yeah let's go
145:18 - ahead and add text in there okay so
145:19 - let's go

146:00 - perfect um I want to give it a certain
146:03 - let's let's work on the span a little
146:06 - bit so first things first I'm going to

146:14 - everything with the line items just play
146:17 - with the color just a little bit
146:20 - okay it just makes it kind of like a

150:17 - borrow from Style card let's hit
150:21 - save and Community card is not defined
150:24 - cool there we go so now we got this ugly
150:27 - looking thing right here but hey at
150:28 - least it's right here and it's ours so
150:30 - that's good plus sign so now let's go
150:35 - inside of this thing and let's start
150:37 - working on it so let's add some padding
150:40 - cool that gives it some breathing room
150:42 - let's text align everything to be on the
150:44 - left that's better let's make it display
150:48 - flex and you know what uh I'm going to
150:52 - give it a going to make it go in columns
150:55 - cool aha looking way better clean let's
151:01 - go down and uh let's start styling the a
151:04 - tag so let's select the a a tags now
151:07 - color black
151:10 - cool my girlfriend's favorite color uh
151:13 - let's go like this boom that padding
151:18 - gives it nice breathing room room from
151:20 - the left and from the
151:23 - top Let's uh play with the font size and
151:26 - give it 12 pixels and then I'm going to
151:29 - do vertical align on this thing and
151:32 - let's see if it actually does anything I
151:35 - don't even think we need this thing Okay
151:37 - cool so let's just leave that out for
151:39 - now cuz otherwise it just gets
151:41 - confusing cool let's go and go on Hover
151:46 - let's add some functionality to it so
151:48 - let's make the color
151:50 - go and do the that blue thing okay so
151:55 - when I hover over it each one of these
151:58 - highlights yeah boom boom boom
152:02 - great okay cool now under hover what I
152:06 - want to do is let's go to our span and
152:09 - let's go display Flex let's go align
152:14 - items and I'm going to vertically Center
152:17 - great so now events is looking good
152:20 - because before it was looking stupid
152:22 - with the plus sign let's go
152:24 - justify content and I'm going to go
152:27 - space
152:29 - between cool so now that plus sign has a
152:33 - space
152:34 - between and it gives it nice little
152:36 - breathing room there okay let's get out
152:40 - of the span tag and uh we're going to

154:35 - component so I'm going to go to my right
154:37 - side component now and inside of my
154:39 - right card component I'm going to remove
154:42 - what we have here and instead I'm going
154:45 - to add a new component called follow
154:47 - card okay so inside of my container I'm
154:50 - going to have a follow card component
154:52 - now inside of here I'm just going to
154:53 - write the text right side and of course

155:36 - around it okay it's at the bottom we'll
155:37 - fix that but that's what you should be
155:39 - having so I just zoomed out a little bit

168:22 - Banner
168:23 - card um yep that's it for the banner
168:26 - card and then now we just have to create
168:28 - styling for it okay so let's go all the
168:30 - way down for Banner card and let's go
168:33 - Banner card and for styling let's just
168:37 - um inherit our styling from follow card
168:41 - cool let's go here and refresh great

169:11 - so just made that a little bit smaller
169:14 - and then for Banner card what we're
169:15 - going to do is we're just going to say
169:17 - hit image make the width of it 100% And
169:21 - then make the height of it
169:23 - 100% and that's it
169:27 - okay that is it oh by the way um I was
169:32 - wondering why my right side was messed
169:34 - up I in my file um which file am I in
169:38 - right now I think right um yep so right
169:41 - side JS inside of this file this was
169:44 - like at the bottom right and I was like
169:46 - why is this the bottom right so um this
169:48 - is a small typo okay so it's right side
169:53 - lowercase okay and that actually brings
169:56 - that to the top right okay so make sure
169:59 - you have that right all right that ad
170:01 - image is acting a little funny so we're
170:03 - just going to keep going and then we're
170:04 - going to have that image show up okay
170:07 - but for now uh the banner card I'm not
170:09 - going to worry about it I'm just going
170:10 - to uh keep rocking and rolling okay so
170:14 - just bear with me and let's go so now
170:16 - we're going to add a common card compon
170:18 - component okay so let's go inside of
170:21 - main um and in here we're going to
170:25 - basically create that component let's go
170:28 - here const common card okay and we're
170:32 - going to do this okay and uh text align
170:37 - it to be Center I'm going to overflow

170:44 - going to be helpful for the share boox
170:46 - in just a second but just um let's keep
170:48 - keep going with this hang in there with
170:50 - me and it'll make sense very very soon
170:53 - okay so we're going to basically add in
170:55 - margin bottom eight8 pixels to this
170:57 - thing background color and we're going
171:00 - to we're going to actually inherent from
171:02 - this okay cuz this is going to be our
171:03 - common styling and then we're going to
171:05 - inherit from this card um let's go
171:08 - border radius and go 5 pixels I'll go

171:35 - this okay so I'm going to go into my
171:37 - container let's remove Main and instead
171:39 - of main we're going to create a new
171:41 - component called sharebox inside of
171:43 - sharebox I'm just going to write in the
171:44 - word share and then uh let's create a
171:48 - style in for sharebox so const sharebox

185:30 - home right so this is all the front end
185:32 - functionality and this is great but
185:34 - remember we still need to add more

185:39 - need to be able to add Firebase to it so
185:41 - we have login and log out functionality
185:43 - from the homepage we still need to be
185:46 - able to add uh re react router
185:49 - redirecting you on login to this page
185:53 - and then we need to add more
185:55 - functionality
185:56 - around being able to write a post so
186:00 - we're going to need a modal we're going
186:01 - to be able to we're going to need to be
186:03 - able to add text in the model and then
186:06 - add images in there and add videos in
186:08 - there and then we're going to need to be
186:09 - able to store that inside a Firebase and
186:11 - then we're going to need to be able to
186:13 - read that from Firebase and show all of
186:16 - it here and then we're going to write
186:17 - need to right react code that can show
186:19 - those components and everything in a
186:21 - beautiful way okay so we're doing great

188:26 - first okay um let's go over to our main
188:30 - JS where we're at right now going to
188:33 - zoom out just a little bit cuz I was a
188:35 - little too close and claustrophobic for
188:38 - comfort and uh let's go right underneath
188:41 - the share box okay so where is it let's
188:45 - go to
188:45 - Main and I'll go right underneath the
188:48 - share boox where share boox is ending
188:51 - and let's open up a div and inside of
188:52 - this div I'm going to add an article
188:55 - okay and inside of this article I'm just
188:57 - going to say article like so okay and
189:00 - let's hit refresh now it says it's not
189:03 - defined because we need to make a
189:05 - styling for that component okay so let's
189:09 - go ahead con
189:11 - article and uh again I can do styled and
189:15 - I'm going to copy from the common card
189:20 - okay so let's go like this beautiful now
189:24 - we have a article right here pretty
189:27 - clean okay pretty nice so let's hit save
189:30 - now let's actually add more things to
189:34 - this okay so first thing I'm going to do
189:35 - I'm just going to add padding zero to it
189:38 - cool um margin of 0 by 0 by 8 pixels
189:44 - okay and then I'm going to do overflow
189:46 - I'm just going to say visible on this
189:48 - thing okay so our article is here it
189:52 - looks great I like how it looks I like
189:55 - how you look and you're important and I
189:58 - love you okay never let anybody tell you
190:01 - otherwise I'm here to support you all
190:04 - right let's keep going so great job on
190:07 - the article all right now let's work on
190:09 - the uh ellipses okay so first what I
190:12 - want you to do is open it up Whoopsie
190:16 - Daisy you're crazy all right this is the
190:20 - Ellipsis SVG it looks like that three
190:23 - collapsible dots okay so what I want you
190:25 - to do is open up your public open up
190:27 - your images and then open up your no
190:29 - that's inappropriate open up your heart
190:31 - that's what I was going to
190:34 - say and drop that image all right great
190:38 - now that you got that image what we're
190:40 - going to do is we're going to go inside
190:43 - of our main and we're going to do a
190:45 - couple of things okay let's go inside of
190:47 - our article component that that we made
190:51 - and we're going to remove what we put
190:52 - inside of there all right simply because
190:54 - we're going to change that bad boy up
190:56 - and add a new component called shared
190:59 - actor okay and inside of this shared
191:02 - actor I'm going to make a link tag now I
191:07 - don't actually need the link I just need
191:10 - to borrow the styling so I'm just going
191:11 - to leave it like this and I'm going to
191:14 - give it an image and we're going to give
191:16 - it a user.
191:18 - where the where does it start
191:20 - typing
191:22 - okay like
191:24 - so
191:26 - okay and uh so that's pretty good as
191:30 - long as our a tag and image is concerned
191:32 - now inside of this a tag I'm going to
191:34 - also add another div okay and uh this
191:37 - div is going to have
191:39 - span and I'm going to have
191:43 - title after title I'll have info
191:47 - okay capitalize the title T and then
191:50 - we're going to have date just like
191:53 - so underneath this a tag I'm going to
191:56 - add a button that button is going to
191:58 - have an image and we're going to give it
192:00 - an
192:02 - ellipsis uh in image SVG okay now it's
192:07 - complaining it's like yeah I don't know
192:08 - what the share actor is no problem const
192:12 - shared
192:13 - actor okay just like that we're going to
192:16 - give it a style div make it empty and
192:18 - save and refresh and it should be
192:21 - defined now okay so now we see title
192:23 - info date right next to each other very
192:26 - uncomfortably close with the three dots
192:29 - okay great so let's start adding some
192:32 - styling to it and make it look
192:35 - good okay make it look good in the
192:38 - hood like you should let's go and do
192:41 - that okay for the shared actor so now
192:43 - this going to require a lot of styling
192:45 - hang in there
192:47 - let's give it padding right of 40 pixels
192:50 - oops cannot see it cool let's go down
192:55 - and I'm going to give it iflex wrap and
192:57 - we'll do no wrap on this thing okay and
193:01 - just make sure the whole thing is
193:03 - wrapped in shared or shared actor just
193:05 - like
193:08 - that okay padding I want to give it 12
193:12 - pixel by 16 pixels by zero cool
193:18 - okay
193:21 - whoops all
193:24 - right let's
193:28 - see okay this is where we have it it's
193:32 - looking
193:34 - good we got some padding going now let's
193:37 - uh do a couple of more things to it okay
193:39 - I'm going to add margin to bottom let's
193:42 - go like this and add some
193:44 - margin and uh underneath that let's go
193:46 - align
193:48 - items
193:50 - Center
193:53 - cool and let's keep going all right so
193:57 - now let's go ahead and add um under
194:00 - align items I'm going to make sure my
194:02 - display is
194:03 - flex okay cool starting to look pretty
194:07 - okay sometimes certain things don't
194:09 - happen but I promise they take some time
194:11 - and then they come together cool so we
194:14 - got display Flex now underneath here
194:16 - let's style our
194:17 - a tag akr link tag and I'm going to give
194:20 - it a margin right of 12 pixels okay so
194:24 - now that button moved just a little bit
194:27 - to the right that's beautiful now U make
194:31 - sure you keep hitting save for the
194:32 - changes to take
194:35 - place so that gives it margin great now
194:38 - let's go flex grow we'll do one on this
194:42 - all right beautiful damage is taken up a
194:46 - lot of that
194:47 - nice and uh now I'm going to do
194:51 - overflow
194:54 - hidden
194:55 - cool and then let's do display
195:00 - Flex
195:02 - okay whoops did not mean to do
195:06 - that all right so now you should have
195:08 - the image here the three dots to the
195:11 - right just like that and then if I full
195:14 - screen it it should still look very
195:15 - similar to this
195:17 - okay cool let's keep on going now
195:21 - underneath it this again doesn't really
195:24 - matter that much but I just like to do
195:27 - it just to be safe that no links have uh
195:31 - any text decoration just cuz it's
195:34 - annoying let's go inside here and now
195:37 - let's style the image tag that's inside
195:40 - of the link tag and I'll give it a width
195:43 - of
195:44 - 48 pixels
195:47 - nice and I will give it a height of 48
195:52 - pixels cool so now what you see is that
195:58 - right
195:59 - there okay so you should see title info
196:02 - date and the three dots
196:05 - great now let's get outside of this
196:08 - image and we will uh select our div and
196:14 - let's go display Flex
196:17 - cool Flex direction we go
196:21 - column so now title info date should be
196:25 - each On Their Own
196:27 - Line
196:29 - okay
196:30 - um let's go flex
196:34 - grow one on this awesome so now title
196:38 - info date should be in the middle
196:44 - okay and we'll do Flex base
196:48 - of
196:49 - zero all right so we got the flex bases
196:52 - now let's go
196:53 - margin uh left on this thing and we'll
196:56 - go 8 pixels for margin so that gave it
197:00 - just a tiny little margin you'll see it
197:01 - move a little bit and I'm going to go
197:04 - overflow hidden again cool so we don't
197:08 - want to see any type of weird overflow
197:10 - happening and um span let's control the
197:14 - span now so text align I'm going to say
197:16 - left
197:18 - so now title info date should be right
197:21 - up next to the
197:26 - image let's grab the
197:29 - first
197:32 - child okay and then we'll go font size
197:36 - 14 pixels cool makes it a little bit
197:40 - smaller we'll make it now
197:44 - Bolder with font weight and again first
197:48 - child is that text right
197:52 - here
197:54 - [Music]
197:57 - okay and then let's give it a color and
198:01 - we'll go 0 0 0
198:05 - 1 okay so that makes it just a little
198:08 - bit uh
198:10 - darker okay then outside of this span
198:13 - tag what we're going to do actually
198:16 - we're still inside of the span but we're
198:18 - outside of the first child right so
198:22 - inside of this span tag let's also style
198:25 - another element so I'm going to
198:28 - go um um basically this means this thing
198:32 - that you're styling all right so that
198:34 - end is referring to this shared actor
198:37 - style div so I'm saying this divs um
198:41 - anth
198:45 - child and and um I'm going to go n +
198:51 - one all right and let's go font size 12
198:57 - pixels cool and then we'll
199:00 - go
199:04 - color
199:06 - great so
199:08 - now the whole thing is just a little bit
199:12 - gray okay so that's pretty good now
199:16 - we're going to go outside of pretty much
199:18 - all of that and we're going to style a
199:20 - button component on its own so we're
199:22 - going to go outside of all of these
199:25 - Squigly and we'll now style the button
199:28 - component and we'll say position
199:32 - absolute so now the button should be
199:36 - hovering right over the photo we'll say
199:38 - right by 12 pixels cool top of zero nice
199:45 - background
199:48 - transparent like so border will go
199:54 - none outline will go none so now there's
199:58 - no boxes around
200:00 - it oops now there's no boxes around that
200:04 - ellipses right it's just the ellipses by
200:08 - itself and uh that's it on the when it
200:11 - comes to this component for now this is
200:14 - pretty good and now let's keep on going
200:16 - all right now now let's add description
200:18 - and a uh shared image okay that's what
200:20 - we're calling it so let's go in finder
200:23 - and this is the image that I want you to
200:25 - use okay this is we'll make a random
200:28 - post so that's the
200:30 - image and I'll cool now let's go to our
200:34 - main after we got that image and now
200:37 - let's start actually working on this
200:40 - okay so what we need to do at this point
200:43 - is we need to find where our shared
200:45 - actor component is which is right here
200:48 - underneath our shared actor component we
200:52 - need to now add a new component and
200:55 - we're going to call that component
201:00 - description inside of description I'll
201:02 - just say the text
201:04 - description just like that that's
201:07 - it okay so that's
201:12 - good uh let's
201:14 - see what is happening here cool cool
201:17 - cool now underneath description we're
201:20 - going to add one more thing we're going
201:22 - to add a new component and it's going to
201:24 - be called shared image just like this
201:27 - and inside of here we're going to have
201:29 - an a tag that's going to be
201:32 - empty and inside of this a tag we're
201:34 - going to have an
201:36 - image like so shared image.
201:42 - jpeg okay so again description
201:45 - [Music]
201:47 - boom again it's complaining that it
201:50 - doesn't know what those style components
201:52 - are no worries we'll add them in right
201:54 - now so let's go add a
201:58 - description so
202:00 - [Music]
202:09 - that boom beautiful here we
202:13 - go that image is just out of control
202:16 - right right now okay that image is
202:18 - overflowing everywhere so all good now
202:21 - we just need to figure out how to
202:23 - control that image okay and uh we'll do
202:26 - that now by styling so inside of my
202:29 - description let's add padding 0 by 16
202:32 - pixels
202:34 - overflow let's make it
202:39 - hidden for
202:41 - color let's go like that okay let's make
202:45 - it a little bit darker
202:52 - cool all right and then uh we're going
202:55 - to go and text align it to the left now
203:00 - you can't see that much right now but
203:02 - now you'll see it okay there we go so
203:05 - save boom that's where my description is
203:08 - that's what you should be seeing right
203:09 - now but really the thing we need to
203:11 - style is that image so let's control
203:13 - that so first of all let's give it a
203:14 - little bit of margin from the top
203:18 - there so now it has a little
203:20 - separation um between the word text and
203:22 - the image itself let's give it a width
203:25 - of
203:26 - 100% cool so again it's still crazy but
203:31 - we'll control it in a
203:33 - second oops let's go here let's go
203:37 - display
203:39 - block
203:41 - cool let's go position
203:44 - relative all right and then background
203:53 - color
203:55 - okay all right and then let's control
203:59 - the image inside of this tag so let's go
204:03 - image object fit
204:08 - contain so still the image should be
204:11 - pretty much out of control with
204:14 - 100% And finally the image is starting
204:17 - to come into
204:23 - control so let's put a semicolon here
204:25 - semicolon here and beautiful so now it
204:30 - actually looks like a legitimate post
204:33 - right description title info date if I
204:36 - go full
204:38 - screen I have description here so now
204:41 - this is looking like an actual post that
204:43 - is
204:44 - great that's what we want
204:47 - all right so now it's looking like an
204:49 - actual image right it looks good so
204:51 - let's keep on going with this and now
204:53 - add social counts underneath here right
204:55 - so for example how many likes does this
204:57 - image have how many up votes does it
205:00 - have and reactions and things like that
205:02 - kind of like in the finished version I
205:05 - can see that there are
205:07 - 75 uh reactions that I have zero

217:00 - inverse of Max width and I'm going to
217:03 - say give it a margin left of 8 pixels
217:07 - okay you're not going to see a
217:08 - difference but let's go full screen
217:11 - here all right and so you see the like
217:14 - icon and you see see the distance
217:16 - between the like emoji and the and the
217:19 - like text all
217:21 - right now on the actual mobile device
217:25 - they're much closer together okay if I
217:28 - actually comment this line out and we
217:31 - full screen it notice that they're much
217:33 - closer together okay so that difference
217:35 - only takes place on a
217:39 - desktop great so so far so good you
217:44 - should be up to Here and Now our posts
217:46 - are starting to take shape and we are
217:48 - liking
217:49 - it all right you dirty boys and girls
217:52 - let's keep rocking and rolling so we're
217:54 - having fun so far having fun so far
217:57 - you're enjoying yourself but now we're
217:59 - going to do reducts and that's going to
218:02 - slap you in the face fun time is over
218:04 - get ready to get spanked actually you
218:06 - might like Redux okay so hang in there
218:08 - and enjoy with me come on let's go so
218:11 - let's get to the Redux part okay so
218:13 - first things first we got to install
218:15 - Redux how do we do that command J open
218:18 - the command
218:19 - line okay and um what I'm going to do is
218:22 - just for a second I'm going to stop my
218:23 - server by doing contrl C okay um on
218:27 - Windows it might be something else but
218:29 - just control C should work all right and
218:31 - I will simply
218:33 - do yarn ad you can do npm install okay
218:38 - it's the same thing yarn add and I'm
218:42 - going to do react Redux like so and I'm
218:45 - going to hit enter and so now it's going
218:47 - to install react Redux and then I'm
218:50 - going to also install just Redux by
218:52 - itself yarn ad and we're going to do
218:54 - Redux like so so go ahead and install
218:57 - both of those beautiful packages my
218:58 - beautiful
218:59 - person okay
219:01 - great now that that's done we're going
219:04 - to go ahead and wrap the entire app in a
219:06 - Redux store so let's go to
219:09 - index.js okay and um simply go at the
219:13 - top and right underneath here we're
219:15 - going to do the following I'm going to
219:17 - import
219:18 - provider
219:20 - prover
219:22 - Provider
219:23 - from react
219:26 - Redux cool and then the next thing I'm
219:29 - going to do is I'm going to import
219:31 - store
219:35 - from
219:38 - store
219:40 - okay um yeah so we have to still of
219:43 - course create a store which we're going
219:44 - to do soon all right so don't freak out
219:48 - but we're going to be creating a store
219:50 - soon
219:52 - okay but yeah this is what all I want
219:55 - you to add for now and then let's go
219:57 - underneath and what I'm going to do is a
220:00 - few things instead of right underneath
220:04 - so this app here right we want to wrap
220:06 - this app inside of our provider now okay
220:09 - so let's go
220:11 - provider and store and we're going to
220:14 - give it our store that we
220:19 - have okay and uh wrap the app inside of
220:23 - that
220:24 - provider that's
220:27 - all cool that's all cool if you try to
220:31 - run your app right now and you're
220:32 - running into an error don't worry it's
220:33 - because we haven't made the store file
220:35 - yet okay so we're going to go ahead and
220:37 - make that store
220:39 - file so let's go ahead and do that all
220:42 - right so uh let's go to
220:45 - our reducers and let's make the reducers
220:48 - first okay so I'm going to go ahead and
220:51 - uh make a
220:53 - reducer let's do it like this so in my
220:56 - source I'm going to create a new folder
220:59 - and it's going to be called
221:01 - reducers okay and inside of reducers
221:04 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
221:06 - make
221:08 - index.js okay great and
221:12 - um what all I'm going to do here is I'm
221:14 - going to say import
221:17 - combined
221:20 - reducers okay and we're going to import
221:22 - that from
221:24 - Redux and let's also do import user
221:27 - reducer
221:29 - from
221:31 - whoops user reducer like
221:34 - this and I'm going to say make root
221:37 - reducer equal to combined
221:41 - reducers that's a cool thing about some
221:43 - of the Redux stuff that we're doing okay
221:46 - and we're going to say user reducer like
221:50 - that okay so this is going to allow us
221:53 - to combine the reducers so it's going to
221:55 - be helpful now let's make another file
221:57 - inside of our reducers folder and this
222:00 - is going to be called user
222:03 - reducer like
222:06 - this okay so let's go inside of our user
222:09 - reducer and we're going to do we're
222:11 - going to initialize the initial state in
222:13 - here and uh we'll simply make the
222:16 - initial state to be where user is null
222:19 - he's empty or she okay and then we're
222:22 - going to say user reducer is going to be
222:25 - whatever um in this case the initial
222:29 - state so the by default if you don't
222:32 - pass in anything it's just going to be
222:34 - the initial State and it's also going to
222:36 - take in an
222:38 - action and we're going to do a
222:41 - switch depending on the action type uh
222:46 - default however will be just the thing
222:49 - that Returns the state okay so if I get
222:53 - so here's how this reducer I think about
222:55 - it right user reducer anytime there's a
222:59 - reducer how I think about it really it
223:02 - should be called in my
223:04 - mind a state updater because all a
223:08 - reducer does is it updates a given state
223:11 - so for example if we gave it some type
223:14 - of state it would would update it okay
223:17 - otherwise it would just return the
223:18 - existing state so here's just a dumb
223:20 - example if I gave it an array um with an
223:24 - action of um you know if I gave it
223:27 - something with the action of like it'll
223:30 - send the payload and it will hit like
223:33 - here and it will increment it by
223:38 - one okay that's where the switch case
223:41 - will come in okay is the switch case
223:43 - like all right then the following action
223:46 - where we increment like by one is the
223:48 - switch action type comment uh well then
223:51 - in that case increment the comment
223:53 - section by
223:55 - one if it's none of those well the
223:57 - default should be hey just return the
223:59 - actual State don't really do anything
224:02 - okay so that's kind of what's happening
224:03 - at a high
224:04 - level all right so now we have both of
224:07 - these made now let's go ahead and of
224:09 - course create our store okay and uh we
224:13 - are going to add our
224:15 - store um we're going to add our store
224:19 - let me actually just see this real quick
224:22 - all right so let's go inside of our um
224:25 - source and in our source we're going to
224:28 - create a new folder okay and we're just
224:30 - going to call that folder store okay and
224:34 - inside of store I'm going to create a
224:36 - new file and this will be called
224:40 - index.js within this file we're going to
224:42 - do a couple of things we're going to
224:44 - create store and we're going to apply
224:47 - some
224:49 - middleware uh did I write it correctly
224:51 - and then remove it yes knowing me
224:54 - probably did something silly like that
224:57 - apply middleware and of course let's
225:00 - bring it from
225:05 - Redux okay import root reducer
225:10 - from reducers okay and um now let's just
225:15 - Define our store and once we do this
225:17 - we're not going to have errors anymore
225:19 - in our app and our app should start uh
225:29 - [Music]
225:31 - running okay great so now store is
225:34 - defined we are also exporting store now
225:38 - that we're exporting store we will have
225:40 - access to it inside of our project and
225:43 - in our index that JS if I go here we are
225:48 - importing that
225:49 - store and then we're passing it to our
225:53 - provider so technically looking at this
225:56 - we should not have any more errors if
225:58 - you do npm start in my case I'm going to
226:00 - do yarn
226:01 - start you should not have
226:04 - um errors on this thing okay so let me
226:09 - refresh okay so it's saying does not
226:12 - contain a default export and what does
226:15 - not contain a default export it is
226:18 - complaining
226:20 - about what is it complaining about
226:23 - attempted import
226:24 - error dot do/ reducers does not contain
226:28 - a default export cool so let's go to
226:31 - some of our reducer files and let's see
226:33 - if we're exporting what we want to be
226:35 - exporting ah looks like we're not okay
226:38 - so in our user reducer we're going to
226:41 - just simply do export default
226:46 - and I'm going to say user
226:48 - reducer or wait am I in user reducer
226:51 - right now no I'm not I'm an index JS so
226:54 - here we have root reducer so I need to
226:57 - be yeah that would make sense so let's
227:01 - export the root reducer and let's go
227:04 - into our user
227:05 - reducer and let's go and Export default
227:09 - user
227:10 - reducer now we should
227:13 - be uh getting both of
227:16 - those did I misspell in yes I did
227:19 - initial should not be spelled intial
227:22 - should be spelled initial so initial is
227:24 - now
227:26 - defined
227:27 - cool now that was just setup okay of
227:31 - Redux and uh there's a pretty good start
227:34 - to it and we're we're making good
227:35 - progress let's keep going all right guys
227:38 - so just a little note this that you're
227:40 - going to build is going to be an example
227:42 - without using Redux toolkit so we wanted
227:45 - to show you what life looks like without
227:47 - toolkit Redux is much harder without
227:50 - Redux toolkit if you built our Disney
227:52 - plus clone you would have noticed things
227:55 - were much simpler with Redux tool kit
227:57 - it's going to be a little bit harder but
227:59 - I think it's important for you to know
228:00 - this because you might go to a company
228:02 - that's not using the Redux tool kit yet
228:04 - so let's
228:06 - go all right so let's go and now start
228:10 - working on the log in functionality okay
228:13 - so I'm going to go ahead to my login
228:16 - component do we have one yet actually we
228:19 - don't so let's go ahead and uh start
228:21 - working on that component now okay so
228:25 - inside of our components oh we do we do
228:27 - my bad cool so inside of our login
228:30 - component we're going to do a couple of
228:34 - things okay let's go all the way at the
228:36 - end where we're exporting default
228:38 - login um we're not going to need that
228:42 - okay so let's remove that for now
228:45 - actually just leave that for now so we
228:47 - don't have an error but we'll delete
228:48 - that later okay and at the top what I'm
228:51 - going to do is let's go import
228:57 - connect
228:59 - from react Redux like
229:03 - so okay and uh let's keep going
229:09 - down and what we're going to do here is
229:12 - now we're going to create a map state to
229:15 - props okay that's another one of the
229:17 - annoying things that we had to do before
229:20 - we got Redux tool kit okay but I'll show
229:23 - you how this works as
229:26 - well
229:29 - okay boom we'll leave that as empty and
229:33 - then we'll also do map
229:35 - dispatch to
229:38 - props
229:40 - okay and then let's go ahead and um do
229:46 - this cool okay again just hang in with
229:50 - me I promise the more you do repetition
229:53 - of building thingies with Redux the more
229:55 - is going to start to make sense but it's
229:57 - kind of one like one of those things
229:58 - that you kind of get the AHA moments all
230:00 - at once and also pattern recognition is
230:02 - key key key to understanding these
230:05 - things okay so don't get discouraged the
230:07 - first time you see this because it's
230:08 - going to freak you
230:10 - out now let's go export default and I'm
230:13 - going to
230:15 - do export default connect and we're
230:17 - going to do map state to props and I'm
230:20 - going to do map dispatch to
230:23 - props two props like that okay and then
230:27 - I'm also going to do login like this
230:29 - okay so freaking weird right but there
230:32 - we go okay that is going to allow us to
230:37 - export login as
230:39 - well cool okay so we're good so far now
230:44 - what we need need to do is we actually
230:45 - need to start installing a couple of
230:47 - things all right now let's go ahead and
230:49 - start installing a couple of other
230:50 - things we're going to need so we're
230:52 - going to need Redux thunk and we're
230:54 - going to need a Firebase okay so let's
230:57 - go ahead and install these things now so
230:59 - I'm going to hit I'm going to click on
231:00 - my command line I'm going to hit contrl
231:02 - C to stop the server to hit enter just a
231:05 - couple of times and then I'm just going
231:07 - to do yarn ad again you can do npm
231:10 - install but I'm just going to do yarn ad
231:13 - and I'll do Firebase like so so now
231:16 - start installing Firebase and once
231:18 - that's done we're going to install
231:21 - something else okay we're going to
231:23 - install Firebase tools cuz you're going
231:25 - to need
231:26 - those so I'm going to do yarn add
231:29 - Firebase tools that's the second thing
231:32 - you're going to need to install and then
231:35 - after that we're going to need one more
231:36 - thing to install
231:44 - all right now and then last one we're
231:46 - going to need is yarn ad and I'm going
231:48 - to do Redux thk Redux Dash thk Okay so
231:54 - we're going to make sure that we have
231:57 - that so those are the three things we're
231:59 - going to install make sure you don't
232:00 - miss on any of these because these are
232:02 - going to be
232:03 - important okay and then of course we're
232:06 - going to need access to our Firebase
232:09 - config files so let's go ahead and get
232:11 - them now all right now so here's what I
232:13 - want you to do go to
232:15 - Firebase okay firebase.com so let's just
232:18 - go together firebase.com like so hit um
232:23 - here I'm just going to go to the email
232:25 - that I prefer and then hit go to
232:28 - console okay and here you're going to
232:30 - see all these clones uh for I mean you
232:33 - might not see any of them this is my
232:35 - Firebase so for you you might have to do
232:37 - add project okay and you might want to
232:41 - do LinkedIn clone I'm just going to call
232:42 - it dummy clone but you should call it
232:44 - LinkedIn clone like this okay so
232:47 - dummy Linked In clone like so hit
232:52 - continue um you don't need anything else
232:55 - and then it'll say creating your project
232:57 - and that's good okay that's kind of what
233:00 - you
233:02 - want and I'll show you what you need to
233:04 - do after
233:06 - that looks so beautiful right look at
233:08 - that
233:09 - UI beautiful just circling around all
233:12 - right so let's H continue on that thing
233:16 - and then let's keep on rocking and
233:19 - rolling um okay so I already have a
233:23 - project created so I'm going to get out
233:24 - of this one now and I'm going to go to
233:26 - the other project that I have okay so
233:28 - I'm going to switch to my LinkedIn clone
233:30 - you just stay in that exact one okay and
233:34 - uh here I'm going to pull go to Project
233:38 - settings okay and we're going to get the
233:41 - things that we need here so go all the
233:43 - way to fire Firebase SDK snippet click
233:46 - config and then get all of the details
233:49 - for your app that you need okay so I'm
233:51 - just going to copy all of these details
233:54 - copy let's go back to our
233:57 - app okay and let's start working on our
233:59 - app
234:01 - so what I'm going to do
234:03 - now all right and just in case you were
234:06 - not able to find this code right let's
234:08 - kind of walk through it together so I'm
234:11 - going to switch to my clone the the
234:13 - dummy one that I was building alongside
234:16 - with you okay and now it might say there
234:18 - are no apps in your project so what I
234:19 - want you to do is click that code button
234:21 - right here go ahead and do that now and
234:25 - now inside of here just call it the same
234:28 - thing we could call it LinkedIn
234:31 - dclone okay and then just hit Register
234:34 - App for
234:39 - now okay and now it's going to give you
234:42 - all of the code that you need
234:44 - okay so then just simply
234:47 - grab grab uh don't grab the script tags
234:51 - but you can just grab everything that's
234:53 - inside of that like VAR okay and just
234:56 - copy it cool great so that's all you
235:01 - need to do on your end all right I'm
235:03 - going to switch back to my other project
235:05 - that I had made and I'm going to grab
235:08 - everything from
235:12 - there all right now now what I want you
235:15 - to do is go ahead inside um of your
235:19 - source and right click on your Source
235:21 - folder and make a new file and I'm going
235:25 - to call it firebase.com
235:45 - you should have the off domain project
235:47 - ID storage bucket messaging sender ID
235:50 - app ID and measurement ID okay and this
235:53 - should be called const Firebase config
235:56 - like that cool now we're going to just
235:58 - do a couple of things after this so
236:00 - Firebase app and I'm going to initialize
236:04 - this app like this and pass in the
236:08 - Firebase config cool that'll help
236:11 - initialize your app now let's uh connect
236:14 - your Firebase to your uh database so
236:16 - let's do Firebase app.
236:20 - firestore okay and let's do const
236:26 - o actually you know what I'll build mine
236:29 - from scratch with you guys okay so let's
236:31 - let's go to
236:33 - my dummy version here okay and I'll just
236:38 - build this out with you guys because I
236:40 - think that's going to be the best way
236:42 - for you guys to pick this up so let's
236:44 - hit save cool now you and I are going to
236:48 - be on the same page okay don't have any
236:51 - unfair Advantage okay so fire store cons
236:57 - off
236:59 - um this is we're going to need this for
237:01 - authentication
237:03 - later so's add that
237:07 - provider new Firebase
237:10 - doo. gooogle o provider
237:15 - okay and then let's do
237:20 - storage Firebase do
237:23 - storage okay because we need to store
237:25 - our images somewhere all right so that's
237:27 - what we're going to be using storage for
237:29 - and now let's export some of these
237:31 - things so we have access to them outside
237:33 - of here
237:36 - okay and then export default database
237:39 - cuz we're going to need access to the
237:40 - database as well so this is what your
237:42 - overall Firebase file should be looking
237:44 - like this is going to be very important
237:46 - for all your
237:47 - Firebase uh stuff so make sure that you
237:50 - don't have some funny weird stuff going
237:52 - on here okay all right now let's go
237:55 - inside of our index.js which is inside
237:58 - of our store okay so we have a bunch of
238:00 - index.js is now but go inside of your
238:03 - store click on that index.js okay and uh
238:07 - here's the here is what we're going to
238:09 - do okay now we're going to
238:11 - add a couple of things to our
238:15 - store okay
238:17 - so let's Hey where's
238:21 - my okay that line was just too far away
238:24 - for me to see let's do import thunk
238:28 - middleware okay from Redux
238:33 - stunk and um also what we're going to do
238:37 - is now we're going to start applying the
238:39 - middleware so I'm going to remove this
238:41 - and I'm going to say apply middleware
238:44 - and I'm going to pass in
238:46 - thunk middleware like
238:49 - so and we're just going to close that
238:52 - per Ren and that's it okay that's the
238:56 - change that we're making here so we
238:59 - should be we should be good for now and
239:03 - now what we want to do is like continue
239:05 - adding in the login functionality okay
239:07 - so we're going to now add a couple of
239:09 - more things to our login okay beautiful
239:12 - you're freaking crushing it let's keep
239:15 - on going so we got this now let's make
239:18 - the login functionality work okay and
239:21 - what do I mean by that here's what I
239:22 - mean by that let's if we go to our
239:24 - finalized LinkedIn clone app if I sign
239:27 - out here look what happens if I hit sign
239:30 - in with
239:31 - Google boom right so this popup how is
239:35 - it happening how's that information
239:37 - being stored we're going to do that and
239:39 - resolve that with Redux okay and
239:43 - Firebase
239:44 - so let's go ahead and work on that
239:46 - functionality now so first things
239:49 - first which one should I work on first
239:52 - let me
239:55 - think okay let's go to Let's actually do
239:59 - this okay so in our source let's make a
240:02 - new folder and we're going to call it
240:04 - actions okay for Redux you have your
240:06 - actions you have your uh reducers you
240:09 - need all these things
240:11 - okay and uh it's good to put them in
240:13 - different folders so inside of this
240:15 - actions we're going to create a
240:19 - index.js cool and uh in here we're going
240:23 - to import a couple of things I'm going
240:25 - to import o and I'm going to import
240:27 - provider and um we're going to get this
240:30 - from
240:32 - Firebase okay and then let's do export
240:35 - function cuz we're going to need to
240:37 - export this anyway so let's go sign in
240:41 - API that's what it's going to be called
240:44 - and what it's going to do is going to
240:48 - dispatch um off okay and we're going to
240:53 - do sign in with popup so this is a nice
240:56 - function that comes with Firebase okay
240:58 - so this Au right here is coming from
241:01 - Firebase so sign in with popup like
241:08 - that okay so sign in with popup once
241:11 - Firebase responds with a prompt promise
241:14 - we're going to do do then okay so we're
241:16 - going to chain
241:18 - it and we're going to pass it a
241:23 - payload payload like
241:27 - so oops
241:30 - boom and then inside here I'm just going
241:33 - to console log the payload okay so we're
241:35 - going to be able to see that great now
241:39 - let's go here and I'm going to do catch
241:43 - and let's catch any errors that we're
241:46 - getting and then I'm just simply going
241:48 - to alert
241:49 - us of the error
241:52 - message okay so this is what your um
241:57 - index JS file should look like right
241:58 - about now okay and now let's go ahead
242:01 - and put it to use all right so now let's
242:03 - go to our login component where we're
242:05 - actually going to use this signin thing
242:09 - okay so
242:12 - login.js and so let's start with
242:17 - importing that little method that we
242:19 - made signin
242:22 - API okay
242:26 - from that okay so that'll imported and
242:31 - now what we're going to do is inside a
242:32 - form where we had Google form now all
242:35 - we're going to do to this component
242:36 - we're going to say hey on click we want
242:39 - you to do
242:40 - something here's what we want you to do
242:44 - we want you to run that function so
242:46 - we're just going to do props do sign in
242:50 - okay that's it okay so let's go ahead
242:55 - and do
242:56 - this okay and we're going to go down and
243:00 - this is where Redux gets funky but just
243:02 - hang in there with me okay and I'll show
243:04 - you how we do this so all the way at the
243:06 - end right here for the Redux portion
243:08 - we're going to add this kind of right
243:11 - below our export default and let's let's
243:13 - go ahead and do map dispatch to
243:19 - props actually we're doing that already
243:21 - so let's just stay in here boom right
243:24 - there
243:27 - okay dis patch and this is the code so
243:30 - let's hit enter and get inside of here
243:33 - and we're going to say sign
243:35 - in okay and what that's going to do is
243:38 - that's going to dispatch our method sign
243:41 - in API
243:45 - okay so this sign in
243:48 - here right corresponds
243:51 - to where we're doing props do signin
243:54 - okay so now those things are connected
243:58 - and again think of Redux Like This
243:59 - Global
244:01 - store okay where when the user logs in
244:05 - it passes the user login information and
244:07 - stores it there on the front end it's
244:08 - kind of like having a database on the
244:10 - front end that you can access really
244:12 - really fast that's how I think about
244:14 - Redux and State Management
244:18 - tools all right awesome so now we got
244:21 - all of this that's looking good now
244:23 - let's actually start dispatching these
244:25 - actions um to the stores after
244:28 - integrating it with Google Au so we're
244:30 - going to start adding the Google um
244:32 - Google Au in uh integration very very
244:36 - soon okay so first of all here's what I
244:38 - want to do let me go to my Firebase okay
244:42 - and uh what I'm going to do to my
244:43 - Firebase is let's go to authentication
244:46 - inside of my
244:48 - Firebase and under my authentication so
244:51 - let's go to our Firebase app and then
244:54 - inside of our app what we're going to do
244:56 - is uh let's go ahead to our
244:58 - authentication and then just go and
245:00 - click get
245:03 - started cool now inside of get started
245:06 - what we're going to do is hit where it
245:08 - says
245:09 - Google for provider and just hit enable
245:13 - um and that's essentially it okay just
245:15 - give it your email whatever your
245:19 - email wait gave me a weird email but
245:21 - whatever that should be good okay so now
245:24 - your Google should be enabled another
245:27 - weird uh thing uh by the way is if you
245:31 - are on some type of different
245:33 - Firebase uh
245:35 - website there you might have uh you
245:38 - might not see what I see here you might
245:40 - see something completely different so
245:42 - what you want to do in that case is
245:44 - actually you want to hit where it says
245:46 - build okay for some of you it might say
245:49 - build click that and then click
245:51 - authentication underneath that that'll
245:54 - bring you to your authentication okay
245:57 - okay so now let's go ahead and start
245:59 - trying things and trying to break things
246:02 - and let's see what happens okay so I'm
246:03 - going to go to my actual app and on my
246:06 - app instead of home let's delete that
246:10 - and let's just go to the you know Local
246:12 - Host 3000 now it's might say the site
246:16 - can't be reached well no problem I'm
246:17 - just going to hit yarn start you can in
246:20 - your terminal hit npm start and you
246:22 - should be good to
246:24 - go
246:26 - okay so now uh we're going to click uh o
246:31 - my middleware is not defined oh okay
246:34 - interesting so let's go to my store my
246:38 - index.js inside of my store okay and in
246:42 - here I'm probably probably capitalizing
246:44 - it somewhere Middle where and let's make
246:47 - it lowercase okay all right there we go
246:51 - all right I'm sorry Frankie Frankie is
246:53 - building it out with me to help test it
246:55 - by the way shout out to Frankie guys
246:57 - Frankie's been here Frankie pop in
247:00 - Frankie has been here and test running
247:03 - and doing the entire build actually with
247:05 - us so he can make sure that this is
247:07 - actually running perfectly for you guys
247:10 - okay so drop some love for Frankie in
247:12 - the comments below cool let's keep going
247:15 - now let's hit sign in with Google and
247:18 - Frankie says it's working for
247:21 - him it's working that's cool right so
247:25 - easy that's so freaking cool let's hit
247:28 - Kia clever
247:30 - program.com nice okay great so let's
247:36 - open up inspect and let's see if the
247:39 - payload is inside of our console and it
247:42 - looks like it is
247:44 - okay so hit
247:47 - inspect go to console and do you see
247:50 - where it says object now click the drop
247:53 - down on the object so you guys should
247:55 - see user right here Okay now click under
247:58 - user did you uh did you click the drop
248:00 - down I now keep scrolling down and
248:03 - you'll actually see display name you'll
248:06 - see email and you'll see email
248:08 - verified yeah okay great and if you keep
248:12 - scrolling down you you'll actually even
248:14 - see things like Photo URL do you see
248:16 - that now if you doubleclick into the
248:18 - photo
248:20 - URL um actually can I select that copy
248:23 - so right click and copy
248:27 - string okay and now open a new tab and
248:31 - paste that
248:32 - string you should see your
248:35 - photo like
248:40 - this okay and that should tell tell you
248:44 - that your um your app is like actually
248:49 - pulling the payload from the sign in
248:52 - right so like where is that payload
248:53 - statement let's just go ahead and search
248:56 - let's go console there's like only one
248:58 - place we're actually doing console log
249:01 - um and it's inside of our uh oops not
249:05 - mean to do that we're doing this inside
249:08 - of our user reducer it seems like
249:14 - no no no I'm sorry why am I I'm being
249:17 - freaking crazy we're it's it's right
249:19 - here not inside of our usereducer we're
249:20 - using it inside of our actions index.js
249:23 - and we're console logging so the
249:26 - payload is actually what Firebase gives
249:29 - us back it's this object that's the
249:32 - payload that gets dropped uh every time
249:35 - we log in so we'll be able to use that
249:37 - payad to pull the photo and pull the
249:39 - name and email and all of that good
249:40 - stuff okay so granted we're able to get
249:45 - everything that we need right granted
249:47 - we're able to get everything that we're
249:48 - looking for we still need a way to
249:52 - actually store that information right we
249:54 - still need a way to store that
249:55 - information so that's what we're going
249:56 - to do and we the website and things
249:59 - still need to change uh based on the
250:03 - user logging in okay because it
250:05 - shouldn't keep saying sign in with
250:07 - Google the whole time that would not
250:08 - make sense all right so let's go ahead
250:12 - and start setting things up up so first
250:14 - thing I'm going to do is inside of
250:16 - actions I'm going to make a new file and
250:21 - this file is going to be called action
250:24 - type.
250:25 - JS okay and I'm going to do something
250:28 - very simple I'm just going to say export
250:30 - const set user equals set
250:36 - user okay that's all set user equals
250:41 - string set user that's it all right now
250:46 - let's go inside of let's see which file
250:48 - should I work on
250:51 - first let's go ahead inside of our user
250:54 - reducer
250:57 - now okay that's inside of our reducer so
251:00 - for example just click reducer then go
251:02 - to user reducer you should be there now
251:05 - we're going to do a couple of things
251:07 - here inside of our switch case so
251:09 - depending on what type of action we get
251:11 - so if we get a case where we're setting
251:15 - a
251:16 - user what we're going to do is we're
251:18 - going to
251:19 - return whatever the state was
251:23 - previously and then add in our new user
251:27 - okay so the state is going to be updated
251:29 - just by one thing now it's complaining
251:32 - here you uh set user is not defined well
251:34 - no worries let's go all the way at the
251:36 - top and let's import it so
251:39 - import set user
251:43 - okay
251:47 - [Music]
251:50 - from actions action type like
251:54 - that cool so now it won't be giving us
251:58 - an error anymore our app should actually
252:00 - be working so we're good with the user
252:03 - reducer for now now let's go inside of
252:05 - our index.js all right and now let's go
252:08 - to our index
252:09 - JS okay and in our index Js all I'm
252:13 - going to do I'm sorry wrong index JS my
252:16 - bad let's go inside of our actions index
252:18 - JS right here and now all I want to do
252:20 - inside of my payload instead of using
252:24 - console log we're going to dispatch the
252:26 - user dispatch means send that
252:30 - information out shoot it okay whenever I
252:32 - think dispatch I think of like the
252:34 - Olympics
252:36 - um um what is it called referee shooting
252:40 - gun right so it's like whenever the
252:44 - starting pistol no not that that's like
252:46 - two of crazy starting pistol okay holy
252:51 - crap this just got
252:53 - crazy uh
252:55 - Sprint Jesus that's what I think of
252:59 - whenever I think of dispatching actions
253:00 - so like whenever we dispatch actions
253:02 - from the store it's like like tell the
253:04 - entire store where where um the user has
253:09 - logged in
253:11 - okay man got crazy so this is who you
253:15 - are when you're dispatching
253:17 - actions is this an actual gun I don't
253:20 - know if they have they don't have real
253:23 - guns right the
253:26 - Olympics okay so let's go inside so in
253:28 - our index JS here now let's just make a
253:31 - couple of changes okay first of all
253:34 - we're going to import from the
253:37 - top import set user like so and I'm
253:42 - going to do fr
253:43 - action type okay that's
253:48 - good now let's also
253:51 - export cons set
253:55 - user this is going to help us set the
253:57 - user and it's going to take in a
254:01 - payload
254:03 - whoops it's going to take in a payload
254:06 - and that's going to be type set user and
254:10 - then the user is going to be the payload
254:13 - okay whatever the payload is going to be
254:19 - cool all right so that's good import is
254:24 - looking fresh and now we're just going
254:26 - to dispatch the action here instead of
254:29 - console logging it so dispatch set user
254:34 - and uh payload user just like
254:37 - so okay save
254:43 - okay so now with all three of those
254:45 - things done hopefully that information
254:48 - is actually being stored inside of Redux
254:51 - let's H sign in with
254:52 - Google and I'm going to go ahead and
254:55 - sign in cool so we'll be able to see
254:58 - later if this information is actually
255:00 - being stored or not all right so now
255:02 - let's redirect the user to homepage on
255:05 - login so I'm going to go to login and
255:08 - inside of my container right at the
255:10 - beginning here's what I'm going to do
255:13 - I'm going to say the following I'm going
255:15 - to
255:17 - say hey if we got a user going
255:20 - on okay then what I want you to do is I
255:24 - want you to
255:25 - redirect to okay and what we'll do is uh
255:29 - let me write redirect and hit enter so
255:32 - import it from react router okay
255:35 - importing that from react router just
255:37 - like that cool and what I will say is
255:40 - redirect me to the home
255:44 - page cool now let's end that bad boy
255:48 - like that beautiful beautiful beautiful
255:51 - beautiful beautiful very very clean line
255:54 - and it says hey if the user is there
255:56 - redirect me now all we need to do to
255:58 - make this magic work is just go all the
256:02 - way to the
256:04 - bottom and um what I'm going to do is
256:07 - right above map dispatch to props let's
256:11 - just add it here
256:13 - uh actually inside of map state to props
256:15 - we can do this okay we can do this right
256:18 - here so where it says return which is
256:19 - empty we're going to say user state to
256:24 - state. user state. user so that's who
256:29 - the user is going to be and look at that
256:33 - it is already redirecting us how
256:35 - freaking cool is that you
256:38 - fools if I go to homepage
256:42 - [Music]
256:43 - okay let's H sign in with Google
256:45 - hopefully it works let's see hopefully
256:48 - it breaks and breaks my heart
256:55 - whoa smash the like button if you
256:57 - enjoyed that one that was really clean
257:00 - okay I'm loving this man are you guys
257:02 - loving this I hope you're loving this
257:05 - okay this is awesome all right now Redux
257:07 - is kind of crazy so before we move on I
257:09 - just want to explain some of this stuff
257:11 - here okay so let's go go back to our
257:13 - homepage or not our homepage but our
257:15 - login page right this sign in popup this
257:18 - just this one line of code makes that
257:21 - popup happen that is insane okay so
257:25 - that's just that one line of code that's
257:26 - making that popup
257:28 - happen then this line of code is telling
257:31 - the app hey this is the user
257:35 - information so I'm dispatching this
257:37 - action when I dispatch this action I
257:40 - sended this function called set user
257:42 - okay and I give it the payload of the
257:44 - user so remember what is payload do user
257:48 - do you guys remember that when I did um
257:50 - let's actually do this right now so I'm
257:52 - going to console log console log and I'm
257:55 - just going to do payload here okay and
257:57 - what I'm going to do here is comment
257:58 - this line out and let's hit refresh now
258:01 - I'm going to hit sign in with Google and
258:02 - let's hit inspect okay on the right hand
258:05 - side and I'm going to go to whoops not
258:07 - sources console okay and I'm going to
258:10 - click sign in right there now an object
258:14 - just appeared okay and it's giving me
258:16 - this information about the user okay now
258:20 - the user information is the one I want
258:22 - right so now watch this now I'm going to
258:25 - do payload do what
258:29 - user right so now watch what happens if
258:32 - I hit save and I hit uh refresh okay and
258:36 - let's go sign in with Google and I'm
258:37 - going to hit kazia clever
258:39 - program.com I'm just going to get the
258:41 - information pertaining to the the user
258:43 - that's it so I'm not getting my display
258:48 - name and I'm getting my email and I'm
258:50 - getting all of that right so that's what
258:52 - payload do user actually is so that
258:57 - object we're sending over to this method
259:00 - over here that's a set user so set user
259:02 - takes a payload the payload was all of
259:05 - the user details now this is types set
259:08 - user and user we set it to whatever the
259:12 - payload was
259:13 - was okay that's kind of what's Happening
259:16 - um that's kind of what's Happening Here
259:18 - okay and let's go to set user boom okay
259:22 - this
259:23 - is it's all freaking connected okay now
259:27 - if I go inside of my reducers and I go
259:29 - inside of my user
259:31 - reducers when it sees the case that I'm
259:34 - trying to set the user it takes my
259:36 - existing state and it just adds the new
259:39 - user to it and if the state doesn't
259:41 - change it just Returns the default state
259:44 - of whatever it was before that user was
259:46 - there that's it okay and remember Redux
259:49 - is immutable so I'm not mutating this
259:53 - okay I'm creating a brand new state with
259:56 - whatever the previous state was along
259:58 - with the new one user that I've added
260:01 - okay so a little bit of just explaining
260:04 - behind the scenes of what's happening
260:05 - with Redux so now what we're going to do
260:08 - is we're going to take the user
260:10 - authentication info when the
260:13 - authentication is changed okay and store
260:16 - it okay so for example when I log in I
260:18 - want to like store that information and
260:20 - have access to it okay anytime I'm like
260:23 - refreshing or getting that information
260:25 - so let's go ahead and work on that now
260:27 - so inside of my actions and index JS
260:32 - what I will do underneath
260:34 - here is uh let's make another function
260:38 - okay and let's call it user o like so
260:43 - get user off okay this is what's going
260:44 - to get the authentication info and uh
260:48 - let's start it off with
260:50 - dispatch cool and I'm going to do this
260:54 - is something that comes from Firebase so
260:56 - on off stay changed do me a favor and
260:59 - run this
261:02 - asynchronously okay you're going to take
261:03 - a user as an input and if user meaning
261:07 - if the user exists or is logged in or
261:09 - whatever dispatch set the user
261:14 - set the user to user okay so that looks
261:20 - good now let's go inside of our app uh
261:23 - JS file and we're going to add all of
261:26 - this here so um let's go ahead and do
261:29 - that
261:30 - okay so first of all I'm going to need
261:33 - to I'm going to need to do a couple of
261:36 - things and for those things we're going
261:37 - to I'm going to I'm going to kind of
261:39 - walk you through all of this okay so
261:42 - first of all
261:43 - right at the
261:44 - start here okay function
261:48 - app um let me think let's have it a take
261:53 - props like that okay and then inside of
261:57 - here I'm actually going to throw in my
261:58 - use effect uh hook so let's go use
262:02 - effect and uh let's hit enter whoops use
262:06 - effect
262:08 - okay there's tons of boiler plate that
262:10 - comes uh with a a lot of this stuff but
262:13 - okay so use effect this is how we write
262:15 - it in here okay so I'm going to say
262:16 - props do get user
262:20 - off cool and then
262:23 - here it's not going to really have any
262:26 - dependencies for
262:29 - now
262:31 - cool okay so now it's going to start
262:34 - telling us hey we're erroring out so
262:36 - let's go ahead and import react hooks so
262:40 - import use effect like
262:44 - so all right so that's now going to
262:46 - import this use effect good use effect
262:50 - is not defined interesting should be
262:54 - defined okay so now it's saying get user
262:58 - off is not a function so we're going to
262:59 - go ahead and import that as well import
263:02 - get user
263:04 - off
263:08 - okay
263:10 - from actions
263:13 - okay so now we got that as well it's
263:16 - good cool so now of course it's saying
263:19 - it's not a function but we're going to
263:20 - go ahead and take care of that okay so
263:22 - let's go ahead inside um you know just
263:25 - get inside of appjs hopefully you're
263:27 - there and now let's go all the way to
263:29 - the bottom and we're going to need to do
263:30 - those map props type of things okay this
263:32 - is very common thing we have to do with
263:34 - the Redux if you're using it without
263:36 - toolkit it's annoying but has to be done
263:40 - okay so we're going to do that now right
263:41 - after take out this fat F wallet from my
263:43 - pocket so let's go ahead and do this so
263:46 - map state to props like so and we're
263:50 - going to do state and let's go like this
263:52 - and we're going to
263:53 - return squigglies like that okay then
263:57 - let's do const map
263:59 - dispatch to props okay we're going to do
264:03 - this it's going to take in something to
264:05 - dispatch and uh get user off and this is
264:09 - actually what's going to start defining
264:10 - your function okay and we're going to
264:12 - say dispatch get user off
264:16 - function okay and then what we're going
264:19 - to do is I'm going to remove this export
264:21 - default line we're going to export
264:23 - default I'm going to say
264:25 - connect okay we're also going to need
264:27 - access to this
264:29 - connect we're going to import it later
264:31 - and I'm going to do
264:33 - map state to props and then I'm going to
264:36 - do map dispatch to
264:38 - props and then let's just do app
264:43 - okay now we're going to need to import
264:46 - connect so let's go ahead and
264:49 - import
264:52 - connect
264:54 - um from Redux
264:59 - okay import connect my bad
265:04 - from
265:05 - from
265:08 - react Redux cool so
265:13 - that's imported now what's the error
265:14 - let's see identifier connect has already
265:16 - been declared oh my bad I'm declar uh
265:19 - getting it too many times it's already
265:21 - right here cool we got Connect Now
265:24 - what's here expected an assignment or
265:26 - function call and instead saw an
265:28 - expression line 37 and
265:32 - 16 cool so let's
265:38 - see okay let's wrap that in parentheses
265:41 - so it's an expression
265:47 - okay don't need that
265:57 - there okay so now that should be good
266:01 - should be good should be good that
266:02 - allows us to get the user info hopefully
266:05 - you're not getting any errors and now we
266:08 - are on the same page beautiful okay so
266:11 - the other annoying thing that I realized
266:14 - guys is um remember my image was not
266:17 - showing up the jobs ad one or whatever
266:19 - this one just kept not showing up I
266:22 - looked at my console and uh it was
266:24 - getting blocked by client for whatever
266:26 - reason so what I decided to go ahead do
266:29 - is like copy that image and open like
266:31 - copy link address open that right here
266:33 - right and then I what what what you can
266:35 - do if you're having the same problems
266:37 - hit save image as okay and um go to that
266:41 - same folder you have everything right so
266:42 - for example for me GitHub Banger
266:46 - projects LinkedIn clone uh public images
266:50 - inside of that images folder I just
266:52 - decided to call it jobs add. jpeg okay
266:57 - um and then I hit save so then it showed
267:00 - up as an image right there okay and then
267:05 - I went to my um right side component cuz
267:08 - that's where it was supposed to show up
267:09 - and it just was like never showing up
267:12 - okay
267:13 - so in the right side component in order
267:16 - for it to show what I did is I went to
267:18 - my banner card and
267:22 - um uh instead of having that static link
267:26 - I just changed it with the actual image
267:29 - okay so how you can do that is simply go
267:32 - and select this/ images jobs. jpeg hit
267:37 - save and
267:39 - then uh this is what you should see
267:43 - okay so go ahead and do that that'll
267:45 - take care of that other problem that we
267:46 - were having earlier okay and if somebody
267:48 - wants to be helpful please drop the
267:50 - timestamp to when this problem was first
267:54 - introduced okay and then um you know and
267:57 - just say this is the bug fix for that so
267:59 - if somebody's looking for it that'll be
268:00 - really really helpful thank you now
268:02 - let's go ahead and display the user
268:04 - photo once the user is logged in so I'm
268:06 - going to go inside of header JS and
268:08 - let's go to where we have user which is
268:13 - user component okay so this user
268:16 - component right here okay so where that
268:18 - says me we're going to replace that with
268:20 - an image of Me Okay the image that I get
268:24 - from Google authentication all right so
268:27 - here's how that's going to
268:29 - go I'm going to go right underneath
268:33 - this a tag cool and uh right underneath
268:38 - this a tag what I'm going to do is open
268:40 - up your squiggly
268:44 - okay and um let's be careful where we
268:48 - put everything okay so
268:50 - squiggly let's do it this
268:54 - way I'm in the wrong place okay remove
268:57 - that squiggly and remove that a needs to
269:00 - be inside of user
269:04 - okay what did I
269:06 - do what did I do I'm sorry I'm confusing
269:11 - you okay leave work alone leave work
269:15 - alone so it should have that a tag in
269:17 - there you're good you don't need to
269:18 - touch work we're trying to touch user I
269:21 - don't know why I decided to go under
269:23 - work probably I've just been coding for
269:25 - so long I'm losing my eyesight a little
269:27 - bit so bear with me here okay I'm just a
269:28 - human being relax so right over here
269:32 - what I'm going to
269:34 - do is uh let's add a squiggly here okay
269:39 - like that okay so the the squiggly opens
269:42 - up here but here's where we're going to
269:44 - close it so remove the closing one and
269:47 - I'm going to close it right above this
269:50 - span just like
269:53 - that okay that is um that is
269:59 - Perfecto okay that's the right spot for
270:02 - me to close it cool so now let's go
270:06 - ahead and make this work so inside of
270:09 - this
270:09 - squiggly we're going to do a couple of
270:11 - things
270:12 - okay I'm going to say
270:14 - props user so if the user is logged in
270:18 - and exists I want the following to
270:20 - happen props user. photo
270:24 - URL
270:26 - okay so if that URL exists then I want
270:31 - um the following to happen
270:34 - Okay so I'm going to make an image tag
270:37 - here and in this image tag for source
270:42 - what I'm going to
270:44 - say is
270:46 - this okay and you can remove the quotes
270:49 - because this is going to evaluate to
270:51 - string anyway once it's done so I'm
270:53 - going to say props do user. photo
270:57 - URL okay and let's end
271:02 - that cool and then I'm going to say
271:08 - colon so like this okay
271:12 - now this looks really intimidating and
271:15 - confusing but let me
271:17 - explain first hey is the user logged in
271:22 - yes they are they exist great then look
271:26 - for their uh photo URL does that exist
271:29 - question mark If it exists then show
271:33 - their
271:35 - photo then I have this Turner operator
271:38 - right there if it doesn't exist show a
271:42 - generic user photo
271:46 - Kish that's what's happening there
271:49 - another thing why my thing looks funny
271:52 - why my this me part with the drop- down
271:55 - sign looks funny is because the drop
271:57 - down is not inside of the span so let's
272:00 - go ahead and uh close that and sandwich
272:04 - that in the span okay so again span
272:07 - should have the word me in it and the
272:10 - drop- down image in it
272:13 - okay so make sure to go ahead and uh do
272:15 - that and once you do that what's going
272:18 - to happen is now your photo and your me
272:22 - with the drop down looks freaking
272:24 - great okay that's what should happen all
272:27 - right so that's looking good now what we
272:29 - need to do is make sure our dispatch is
272:31 - happening because right now um our app
272:35 - does not know about the image so it
272:37 - needs access to the store and we need to
272:39 - dispatch that action okay so then it's
272:41 - going to have access to the photo so
272:43 - anyways long story short let's go all
272:45 - the way to the
272:46 - bottom and let's go ahead and do map
272:49 - state to props like so and
272:53 - state whoops okay
272:57 - State and then inside of here we're
273:00 - going to return user state. user state.
273:05 - user annoying boilerplate
273:07 - code okay that's map state to props now
273:10 - we also need map dis patch uh to
273:14 - props and let's go
273:19 - dispatch all right like this let's leave
273:22 - it empty for now we don't really have
273:24 - anything going on in here just yet and
273:26 - then this last line where it says export
273:28 - default header remove that line so we're
273:32 - going to delete that line and we're just
273:34 - going to do export default connect and
273:38 - you guys know the drill we're going to
273:39 - connect map state to props
273:42 - like so then we're going to do map
273:45 - dispatch to
273:46 - props and then we're going to do header
273:50 - like
273:52 - this oky dokie Mr Pokey okay so that is
273:59 - pretty good for now let me actually just
274:02 - see if we need to change any additional
274:03 - things at the top did we import connect
274:06 - yes we did import connect so that's
274:09 - looking good so far okay great so it is
274:12 - working uh in order to be able to see it
274:15 - first of all it's at the bottom right
274:17 - you should be seeing your logged in
274:19 - photo because I'm logged in and you
274:22 - should be seeing your logged in photo at
274:24 - the bottom right if you're logged in and
274:27 - at the top right you should actually be
274:29 - seeing it if uh in desktop mode okay so
274:32 - you should be seeing your photo
274:34 - cool
274:36 - amazing okay now what we want to do is
274:39 - uh add the ability to sign out so when I
274:41 - hover over sign um me right if I hit
274:44 - sign out I cannot sign out so let's add
274:46 - that ability
274:48 - so um let's go and start
274:51 - off by first of all inside of actions
274:55 - we're now going to create a new file
274:59 - actually no let's not create a new file
275:00 - let's just go inside of our index.js so
275:03 - in here remember we added the signin
275:06 - functionality and the get user off
275:09 - functionality so let's go underneath
275:11 - that and let's add the sign out
275:13 - functionality now so let's do export
275:15 - function sign out
275:19 - API
275:21 - okay and then let's do return
275:28 - dispatch just like this all right inside
275:32 - of this dispatch all we're going to do
275:34 - is um we're going to dos. sign out and
275:37 - again this comes built in with um fire
275:41 - fire basee okay that's why Firebase is
275:43 - so nice and then we're going to do then
275:47 - okay leave that
275:48 - empty and we're going to do dispatch set
275:51 - user to null okay so we're going to run
275:54 - that function we're going to set the
275:55 - user to null okay that's going to remove
275:58 - any user that's existing and then I'm
276:00 - going to do do catch any
276:02 - errors
276:04 - um and if there any errors just simply
276:07 - console log them in this
276:10 - case great so this is what your sign out
276:13 - API should be looking like right now
276:15 - okay so continuing on with our
276:17 - functionality now we're going to do just
276:19 - a few things okay so let's go to
276:23 - our
276:24 - um when we sign out so let's think about
276:28 - this right when we sign out we need to
276:30 - be redirected back to the homepage right
276:34 - just like when we sign in we need to be
276:36 - redirected back let me fix that when we
276:39 - sign out we need to be redirected to the
276:41 - login page just like when we sign in
276:44 - we're redirected to the homepage okay so
276:46 - we're going to work on
276:48 - that um that was Nas say hi to NAS
276:51 - everybody behind me beautiful so we're
276:55 - going to add that redirect in just a
276:57 - second but first let's start off with
276:59 - the functionality so I'm going to go to
277:01 - my header okay and let's first of all
277:05 - import the sign out functionality that
277:08 - we made okay so let's import sign out
277:12 - API okay and where are we going to
277:15 - import that from well you know where
277:17 - we're going to import that from from our
277:19 - actions where we just finished making it
277:21 - okay in the
277:24 - index.js so now this will actually
277:26 - import it okay why is it saying modules
277:29 - not
277:30 - found/
277:34 - actions oh my bad dot dot SL actions
277:37 - there we go okay because I'm inside of
277:41 - of headers which is inside of components
277:43 - so I need to back out first and then I
277:47 - have access to this actions folder okay
277:50 - got to back out then boom hence the two
277:53 - dots right there
277:56 - cool okay so now inside of my sign out
277:59 - let's find that so sign out is right
278:02 - there and uh to this sign out all I'm
278:04 - going to say is a on click I want you to
278:07 - do something for me okay and sign out is
278:08 - going to be like hey what do you want me
278:09 - to do well on click
278:12 - um I want to actually sign
278:15 - out okay I want to call the sign out
278:18 - method now remember because we're using
278:22 - Redux you can't just normally make this
278:24 - work because that would make too much
278:26 - sense unfortunately so in Redux you do
278:29 - things always in a really obnoxious
278:32 - boilerplate method thank you Dan abov
278:36 - the founder of
278:37 - Redux so I'm going to go to my dispatch
278:40 - to props and in here all I'm going to do
278:45 - is we're going to add in sign
278:47 - out and what sign out is going to do is
278:50 - dispatch and we're going to use our uh
278:54 - method that we created earlier dispatch
278:56 - sign out API okay so that should already
279:00 - be pretty good okay so let's go ahead
279:03 - and see if that does anything or not so
279:06 - sign out whoa it actually worked did you
279:09 - guys see the photo change that's
279:11 - freaking
279:12 - amazing so let's actually go back to our
279:15 - homepage and let's test this out let's
279:17 - hit sign in and it should redirect us to
279:20 - the homepage when I sign in so boom let
279:23 - me choose my email okay redirected me
279:26 - and look my photo is of the logged in
279:28 - user that photo is being pulled straight
279:30 - from Firebase now if I hover over and
279:33 - click sign
279:34 - out it signed me out and the photo is
279:37 - gone but what should happen when I sign
279:40 - out I need to be redirected back to the
279:44 - login page so let's just go ahead and
279:47 - add that last bit of functionality and
279:49 - how we're going to do that is let's
279:51 - start off by going to our homepage and
279:54 - inside of our homepage I need to make
279:56 - sure that I import my
279:59 - redirect okay
280:02 - from react router Dom because that's
280:05 - what allows me to manipulate the Dom and
280:07 - manipulate which Pages I'm at I also
280:10 - need to import connect cuz I'm going to
280:12 - need that for this from
280:14 - react Redux and again this is Redux
280:18 - without toolkit okay so this is why you
280:20 - still have to do mappings and connects
280:24 - okay now inside of my container right
280:27 - over here here's what I'm going to
280:30 - do all right we're just going to add
280:32 - that right there and I'm going to say
280:33 - hey if the user is not logged in or
280:36 - there is no
280:38 - user then what I want you to do in that
280:41 - case is
280:42 - redirect me to the homepage or I'm sorry
280:47 - I keep saying the homepage but the login
280:49 - page in this case Okay um and of course
280:53 - we want to close this so let's go ahead
280:55 - and do
280:57 - that okay cool so now when I sign out it
281:01 - actually brings me back to the homepage
281:03 - okay and last things I want to do in
281:06 - order to make sure that that happens and
281:09 - my store knows about it here's what I
281:11 - need to do because that functionality is
281:12 - still not necessarily working we're
281:14 - going to do map state to
281:18 - props and I'm going to let the state
281:21 - know about hey user update the user
281:24 - State like so and I'm going to delete
281:28 - this line and we're going to do export
281:30 - default and this is what we've been
281:32 - doing with Redux every single time so
281:33 - connect map state to props and we're
281:36 - just going to leave it to that because
281:37 - we don't need to dispatch any actions in
281:40 - this case
281:42 - and uh of course add home just like this
281:44 - okay so now refresh so now watch what
281:47 - happens okay I'm going to sign in with
281:50 - Google now it should update my photo at
281:52 - the bottom
281:54 - right now let me full screen it real
281:57 - quick full screen hover over let's click
281:59 - sign out and boom that works that is
282:04 - nice right when I sign out it actually
282:07 - brings me back straight to the homepage
282:11 - okay so hopefully you're enjoying this
282:13 - so far and now we're going to start
282:15 - displaying the username right next to um
282:19 - right next to our user profile okay user
282:21 - image all right so here we go so now
282:24 - we're going to actually add the user
282:26 - display username on the left hand side
282:28 - okay so um and we're going to do
282:32 - that right there okay where it says
282:34 - welcome rafic Kazi that's kind of what
282:36 - we're going to do in our own app okay so
282:38 - first of all just let's just log in so
282:40 - it redirects to the
282:42 - homepage beautiful that looks good okay
282:47 - but now it says welcome there well it
282:50 - should know who we are so it shouldn't
282:51 - say there it should actually say our
282:53 - name now so let's go ahead and do that
282:56 - so I'm going to go to my left side
282:58 - component that I have and then where we
283:02 - have this link this is where we need to
283:04 - change it okay and here's how we're
283:05 - going to do that so I'm going to say
283:06 - props that user this going to get me
283:09 - access to the user and remember this
283:11 - display name this is what should get me
283:14 - access to the name um so what I'm going
283:19 - to do is I'm going to basically be like
283:21 - uh hey if the user exists okay so Props
283:25 - do
283:27 - user if the user exists this is a nice
283:30 - fancy Turner operator that says then
283:32 - show me the username otherwise show me
283:36 - blank okay or I can just say show me
283:40 - well um
283:41 - there okay so that way it says there for
283:45 - now and then if the user will be there
283:47 - it'll say their name instead cool well
283:50 - why is it not getting the name you might
283:51 - ask well what we're going to have to do
283:54 - is tell Redux about it so this is where
283:56 - we need to map state to props so let's
283:59 - do cons map state to
284:02 - props like
284:05 - this open this bad boy up and again
284:08 - we're going to return user
284:11 - state. user
284:13 - state. user like this
284:16 - okay let's
284:19 - refresh okay and we're going to go ahead
284:21 - and connect it
284:23 - now to our component all right so let's
284:26 - go here boom import connect like this
284:32 - from react Redux so now we have this
284:35 - imported that's great let's go all the
284:38 - way down it's a lot of lines of code in
284:41 - there remove this and we're going to do
284:43 - export default connect map state to
284:49 - props and we'll just do left side like
284:53 - this okay again we're not doing any
284:55 - dispatching here we're only doing
284:58 - reading and
285:00 - retrieving all right so now rafii is
285:03 - being read hey that's amazing right let
285:06 - me go home rafik Kazi if I log out it
285:10 - should basically be uh nobody okay cool
285:16 - slome doesn't even let me go to home
285:20 - Okay when I log in it lets me go to home
285:22 - so that's really good my authentication
285:24 - it seems like it's working really well
285:27 - and things are good now we're going to
285:28 - start working on the modal okay so let's
285:30 - go ahead to main
285:32 - JS file and instead of post Malone we're
285:36 - going to be working on post modal
285:41 - so
285:43 - congratulations all right post modal
285:47 - there we
285:48 - go you like that one no yeah all right
285:52 - and U pretty much what I'm going to do
285:54 - is right underneath where article is
285:57 - ending and there's a div ending right
285:59 - underneath the article let's go
286:01 - underneath that div and I'm going to add
286:04 - the post
286:05 - modal okay and you'll be like hey
286:09 - kazzy hey kazzy where are you importing
286:12 - the pulse model from that's a really
286:14 - good question it doesn't exist yet so we
286:18 - need to go ahead and make it so inside
286:19 - of components I'm going to create a new
286:22 - file it's going to be called postm
286:25 - model.
286:27 - JS okay and now we're going to start
286:30 - working on this model and it's going to
286:31 - be nice so let's start off with styled
286:33 - from styled components because we're
286:35 - going to need to style this
286:37 - thing and of course let's go ahead and
286:41 - go it's going to get some props okay
286:44 - there as
286:46 - arguments and um I'm going to create a
286:49 - new component inside of here it's going
286:51 - to be a container and I'm just going to
286:52 - say post modal for now let's hit refresh
286:55 - it's still complaining well that's
286:57 - because I have to export default post
286:59 - modal and now it should stop complaining
287:02 - soon okay it goes hey I don't know what
287:04 - container is no worries I'm going to
287:06 - cons
287:07 - container and let's actually go styled d
287:10 - and leave it as an empty cool so now all
287:14 - the errors are gone and we're back to an
287:17 - operational app which is exactly what we
287:20 - want now inside of our container we're
287:22 - going to style it so I'm going to say
287:24 - position
287:26 - position
287:28 - fixed okay where is our uh model I'll
287:32 - show you our model will be available for
287:34 - us shortly okay let's go top zero for
287:39 - the model
287:41 - yeah let's go left
287:46 - zero okay and um we're going to start
287:49 - seeing it
287:50 - soon hopefully I'm as surprised as you
287:54 - when we see it just kidding all right
287:57 - bottom
287:58 - zero okay so that allows us to put it at
288:01 - the top we're going to give it a really
288:02 - high Z index okay so you just kind you
288:05 - can kind of do that that will make sure
288:07 - that it's always on top of things so now
288:09 - you're starting to see it post modal
288:12 - okay and now 0 0 0 0 it means zero on
288:15 - the left axis x axis y AIS and uh that's
288:20 - what you end up getting when you go
288:22 - 0 so what this does here by the way
288:25 - right is this 00 you're wondering what
288:27 - it does so hit come here and inspect the
288:29 - element now when I inspect it look the
288:31 - modal is actually over the entire screen
288:35 - okay and um if I actually change this to
288:38 - 10 pixels or let's go 50 pixels so
288:41 - something visible from the top it's
288:43 - pushing it down but notice now it's not
288:45 - the entire screen so why we do that
288:48 - sometimes 000000 like that is to kind of
288:51 - in an easy way say hey take over the
288:53 - entire browser okay so this right now is
288:57 - taking over the entire browser and it
288:59 - has a massive Z index so it'll also take
289:02 - over more
289:05 - priority cool so now inside of color I'm
289:08 - going to give it color black
289:11 - and just to kind of show you this right
289:13 - if I actually gave it a background color
289:15 - of let's say black Watch What Happens
289:18 - boom my entire screen is now gone black
289:21 - okay and if I gave it a uh zindex of -20
289:25 - now it's hiding behind but you can still
289:27 - see the little black bars on the side
289:30 - okay so that Z index is just to make
289:32 - sure that always stays on top of
289:34 - everything else and instead of black of
289:37 - course it's a crazy color to give it
289:38 - right now um
289:41 - we're going to just give it
289:44 - um 0.8 just like this okay that's what's
289:47 - going to happen when the modal opens
289:49 - that's what's going to happen to the
289:50 - entire screen that's what we want okay
289:53 - so then we can see the modal easily so
289:56 - that's how we make that happen cool now
289:59 - last thing we want to do is I mean we're
290:00 - already exporting it and we're using it
290:03 - in main JS right so let's go to our main
290:06 - and we have post modal that's how we're
290:09 - getting this cool beautiful and make
290:12 - sure we're imported okay perfect good
290:14 - job so far let's keep rocking and
290:16 - rolling and now we're going to start
290:18 - adding main content component inside of
290:20 - post model so let's go to post
290:23 - model and inside of here I'm going to
290:26 - remove where it says post modal okay and
290:30 - I'm going to say content cool inside of
290:32 - content let's just write content for now
290:35 - and uh leave it pretty blank and we're
290:38 - going to add in a new styled component
290:40 - I'm I'm going to say content with style
290:42 - div of course empty to just start it off
290:45 - with and we'll give it a width of
290:49 - 100% okay
290:53 - cool all right Max width will give it of
290:58 - 552 pixels so it will never be bigger
291:02 - than that we're going to give it a
291:04 - background color of
291:06 - white so now we can actually start to
291:10 - see this
291:12 - Okay cool so we can see that the model
291:15 - is starting to become visible and now
291:17 - what we're going to do is let's give it
291:19 - a let's remove that uh let's actually
291:22 - keep that my bad and let's go and give
291:24 - it a Max height of
291:27 - 90%
291:29 - cool overflow will go
291:33 - initial okay and then let's go border
291:38 - radius of five pixels
291:41 - okay so now we're starting to have
291:42 - slightly rounded Corners right
291:47 - there we'll go
291:50 - position
291:52 - relative display
291:54 - Flex okay and now let's do Flex
291:58 - Direction column in this case
292:02 - cool we'll top 32
292:06 - pixels that pushes it down and we're
292:09 - going to go margin zero Auto okay so now
292:14 - we have this thing smack in the middle
292:17 - showing up exactly where we want it
292:20 - beautiful so that's all we wanted to do
292:23 - for this and now we're going to add
292:25 - header in post modal component okay so
292:28 - let's go and do that so inside of
292:30 - content I'm going to remove content and
292:33 - I'm just going to go header like
292:36 - this okay cool and inside of here what I
292:42 - want to say is let's go in h add an H2
292:45 - and we'll do create a post like
292:48 - that right underneath this I'll add a
292:52 - button and inside of this button I'm
292:54 - going to add an image and this image is
292:57 - going to be a close icon.
293:00 - SVG
293:03 - okay and now the header is going to say
293:06 - hey I'm not defined well no problem okay
293:09 - and I'll show you how to add a close
293:11 - Icon by the way so the close icon
293:13 - actually
293:14 - is right here it looks like that little
293:17 - X at the top so let's go grab that close
293:22 - icon and drop it inside of our images
293:25 - now you should have access to it okay
293:28 - let's go back to the code that we were
293:30 - on inside of components post model. JS
293:34 - so we added that image and now we're
293:36 - going to actually create styling for
293:38 - that component so con header
293:42 - let's start it off with blank and then
293:45 - let's go ahead and start now styling it
293:47 - okay so we now see create a post so that
293:50 - looks pretty
293:52 - good display
293:54 - block I'm going to add padding to
293:59 - it boom now the padding starting to look
294:03 - good I'm going to add a border bottom so
294:06 - I'm going to add a something on the
294:08 - bottom
294:10 - [Music]
294:12 - okay and then lastly we're going to do
294:14 - this clean let's give it a font size of
294:18 - 16
294:20 - pixels I'm going to give it a line
294:23 - height of
294:25 - 1.5
294:29 - beautiful I'm going to go rgba on this
294:33 - thing and let's do this cool so it's
294:38 - like a little gray out now we'll do font
294:41 - weight
294:43 - 400 and then justify actually before we
294:46 - do that let's enable display
294:49 - Flex let's go justify content on this
294:53 - thing and we'll go
294:55 - space between so now that X should
294:59 - springboard over all the way to the
295:01 - right hand
295:02 - side I'm going to go align items
295:07 - Center dope and then of course let's
295:10 - styled the button and I'm going to go
295:12 - height 40
295:15 - pixels width 40
295:18 - pixels great Min with
295:24 - Auto uh
295:26 - color let's do the same thing a little
295:29 - bit of
295:30 - that gray never hurt nobody
295:34 - cool and then
295:36 - SVG hey pointer events make sure that
295:38 - there are
295:41 - none
295:44 - pointer events are none
295:47 - okay cool

295:55 - boxy looking um X in the
295:58 - modal it's pretty good it's a good start
296:02 - okay let's create shared content and add
296:06 - user info part inside of it okay

296:37 - image slash images SL user VG okay this
296:41 - is just going to be that dummy user
296:43 - image and for span let's go

297:28 - off things are already starting to look
297:31 - in control display Flex is such magic
297:35 - Flex

298:06 - padding 8 pixels by 12 pixels
298:12 - beautiful great now let's inside of our
298:15 - user info let's go ahead and do a couple
298:17 - of
298:19 - things enable display Flex here I'm
298:22 - going to align my items to the
298:26 - center so I can see that n is in the
298:29 - middle but it's still behind the
298:31 - photo add padding 12 pixels by 24 pixels
298:36 - like so cool and now let's control our
298:40 - VG and our images and we're going to
298:42 - give them the same type of
298:45 - styling
298:48 - boom boom cool
298:52 - background clip going to go content
298:57 - box okay border two pixels solid
299:03 - transparent border radius this is going
299:06 - to give it the nice little circle that
299:09 - we always love
299:12 - looking clean and then of course let's
299:15 - go inside of our span and now we're
299:17 - going to go font weight
299:20 - 600 font size 16 pixels line
299:26 - height
299:28 - 1.5 cool so now the text is looking
299:31 - Bolder and then of course let's give it
299:33 - a little bit of margin cuz it's getting
299:35 - a little too close to that logo so let's
299:38 - push it a little bit
299:41 - okay beautiful so that looks great to
299:46 - me for shared content right this model
299:50 - is looking good I mean of course we
299:51 - still need to add functionality so when
299:52 - I hit X it actually goes away right and
299:56 - uh things like that so we're going to
299:57 - now start adding those things
300:00 - in okay we also need to make sure the
300:03 - text editor is editable so that's going
300:05 - to need um you know quite a bit of work
300:07 - so let's work on that now
300:11 - all right so cool let's start working on
300:13 - the text editor and add in bunch of
300:15 - functionality so I am going to go um in
300:19 - I mean I'm I'm going to just stay in my
300:21 - post model okay and then um let's add
300:24 - another component and I'm going to add
300:26 - it right underneath shared content so
300:28 - we're going to call it share creation
300:30 - like this and let's just type in some
300:32 - word in there like actions let's go all
300:35 - the way down and um I'm going to add a
300:37 - component styling for this style div hit
300:41 - save just so that error stops display
300:45 - Flex so you guys you should be able to
300:47 - see actions in there now okay it should
300:49 - be it's right there boom cool now I'm
300:53 - going to do justify content space
300:57 - between cool and then of course padding
301:00 - 12 pixels 24 by 16 cool now we just
301:04 - added some padding kind of everywhere
301:07 - from every direction so
301:10 - that looks that looks good now we're
301:13 - going to add creation buttons okay so
301:15 - you might be wondering hey are you
301:17 - getting the creation buttons from here
301:19 - so we're going to have the share image
301:21 - okay that image right there at the top
301:22 - and we're also going to have that image
301:24 - the video image as well so share image
301:26 - share video I'm going to drag this into
301:30 - my images and drop cool so that's going
301:33 - to be there now let's go inside of my um
301:38 - right underneath share creation inside
301:42 - of share creation I'm going to remove
301:44 - the word actions and instead I'm going
301:46 - to write attach assets okay and let's
301:49 - create a new component called attach
301:51 - assets okay and inside of attach assets
301:55 - let's create a new component called
301:57 - asset button like that and inside of
302:01 - asset button I'm going to add an image
302:03 - and that image is going to be images
302:05 - share. image.svg
302:08 - cool and then I'm going to have another
302:10 - asset button asset button and inside of

302:24 - bottom let's do const asset button is
302:27 - equal to styled
302:29 - button okay and I'm going to
302:32 - do let's do display Flex on this thing
302:36 - um of course it's saying that error so
302:39 - let's actually
302:40 - start that um styling too so we we don't
302:43 - have that error

302:53 - add so now let's go here and do align
302:56 - items
302:58 - Center Height we'll make it 40
303:02 - pixels let's give it a Min width of
303:06 - auto color I'm going to go rgba
303:10 - 0000
303:13 - 0.5 okay and then under attach
303:17 - assets let's do align items Center do

304:03 - pixels like this cool so now that should
304:08 - be good okay okay if I made that 100
304:10 - pixels it'll be really obvious what
304:13 - happens so if I go 100 pixels like that

307:31 - it Min with 60
307:35 - pixels cool border radius 20
307:41 - pixels o I like how it's looking padding
307:45 - left 16
307:47 - pixels cool let's add some padding right
307:50 - by 16 pixels okay so now it's made it a
307:54 - little bit bigger
307:56 - background like
307:59 - this okay give it a little blue we'll
308:02 - color it
308:04 - white okay and then on Hover
308:10 - so I'll do this on Hover we're going to

308:16 - of that right there cool so when I hover
308:22 - boom just a little bit extra blue click
308:24 - it and I can press it okay beautiful all
308:28 - right so now that we added that post
308:29 - button let's remove the remove close
308:33 - button image okay and we're going to do
308:37 - some stuff with being able to hide it
308:38 - and show it so when we hit X we want
308:41 - things to be able to happen Okay so
308:42 - let's go and work on that now okay and
308:46 - um I was going to work on the text
308:48 - editor earlier but let's go and work on
308:50 - it now okay so let's go ahead and work
308:53 - on the text editor cool so no worries in
308:57 - post model what I'm going to do is all
308:59 - the way at the top
309:02 - okay let's go import use State like this
309:06 - okay use react States
309:09 - because we're going to need to work with
309:10 - State now and uh let's just let's start
309:15 - so here I'm going to
309:16 - say editor text and then we're going to
309:19 - do set editor text so this is going to
309:21 - be a function that allows us to change
309:23 - the text all right it's kind of how you
309:26 - also set variables in react the react
309:28 - way of setting variables and we're going
309:30 - to start off with it being blank okay so
309:34 - the functionality we're working on now
309:36 - is this one so when I hit start a post
309:38 - this m pops up the text in the start is
309:41 - blank and then as I start typing it it
309:44 - updates the text so we're going to do
309:46 - that in our app that's not built yet
309:49 - cool so let's go underneath user
309:55 - info
309:57 - okay so underneath user info I'm going
310:00 - to make my editor
310:02 - component and uh editor component is
310:05 - going to take in the text area actually
310:07 - let's before I make my editor component
310:09 - let's leave it blank let's start off
310:12 - with uh just doing text area like
310:16 - this um cool I'm going to remove just go
310:21 - ahead and remove all of this for
310:24 - now all right and what I will say is
310:27 - inside of text area let's add something
310:30 - for Value so we're going to make value B
310:34 - the editor text so whatever the state um
310:38 - of the text is okay so right now it's
310:41 - not really going to be doing much so
310:43 - when I type it doesn't do anything it
310:44 - just kind of freezes that's what should
310:46 - be happening with yours okay then after
310:50 - text I want to do on change I want
310:52 - something to happen okay and what do I
310:54 - want to happen on change I want to
310:58 - take let's go like this I'm going to
311:02 - take whatever the value you're giving me
311:04 - and I want to set it to the editor
311:07 - text so I'm going to do e . target. Val
311:10 - so whatever you're
311:12 - typing
311:14 - okay it's complaining e is not defined
311:18 - okay not to worry we're going to take
311:20 - care of that shortly okay so we have
311:22 - onchange and we have the onchange ending
311:25 - right there cool let's go ahead and add
311:29 - the placeholder as well in just a second
311:32 - all right just make sure you refresh as
311:34 - soon as you refresh you should be good
311:36 - to go and all that's happening is as
311:38 - soon as I do I type in F in the text
311:41 - area now it calls this on change okay it
311:46 - goes on change what should I do on
311:48 - change says hey grab the event okay what
311:52 - was the event I wrote this thing so now
311:55 - what we do is we change the editor text
312:01 - variables value which was blank in the
312:03 - start with whatever the target value is
312:05 - in this case that's F so now this Ed
312:09 - text here becomes F and then it shows F
312:12 - now when I write
312:13 - Fe it becomes
312:16 - Fe it passes that here that passes that
312:20 - here and then that shows that there
312:24 - super confusing but that's what's
312:25 - happening okay and then if I hit post I
312:28 - have access to all of that information
312:30 - so now let's do
312:33 - placeholder whoops let's not do that
312:37 - placeholder
312:39 - okay and then my placeold is going be
312:42 - what do you want to talk
312:45 - about
312:47 - cool so if you remove everything that's
312:50 - the that's what the placeholder will be
312:53 - and of course let's also do
312:56 - auto focus to
312:58 - be
313:01 - true okay so as far as my text area is
313:05 - concerned that's looking good now what
313:07 - I'm going to do is I'm actually actually
313:09 - going to create my styled component I'm
313:11 - going to do this one the other way so
313:13 - let's go ahead and create a styled
313:15 - component called editor and do style
313:19 - div okay and I'm going to and I'm going
313:22 - to style it in just a second let's go
313:25 - and
313:26 - add let's go and take what we created
313:29 - this text area and we're going to wrap
313:32 - this entire text area inside of our a
313:35 - new component called editor
313:39 - so make sure you cut that and you wrap
313:42 - the text area inside of editor just like
313:44 - this okay now we need to style our
313:48 - editor
313:49 - component okay great let's add some
313:55 - padding and I'll go 12 pixels by 24
313:59 - pixels like so let's now style the text
314:03 - area inside of this editor let's go with
314:08 - 100% goul just big let's give it a Min
314:11 - height of 100
314:13 - pixels great did that do anything yes I
314:17 - made it fat which is exactly what we
314:19 - want and then uh resize
314:23 - none okay so now so notice this little
314:26 - touch right if I have resize enabled at
314:29 - the bottom right you see this resize and
314:31 - I can resize it to whatever I want right
314:33 - boom it's kind of weird by doing resize
314:36 - none it now there's nothing there's no
314:40 - way to resize this that's what we
314:43 - want let's go here and let's go
314:47 - input with
314:49 - 100
314:51 - beautiful okay so whatever we're writing
314:55 - here input cool height of 35 pixels
315:01 - cool font size of 16
315:06 - pixels okay
315:09 - all right and then right underneath it
315:11 - we're going to go margin bottom 20
315:16 - pixels okay
315:19 - great our text box looks text box looks
315:24 - absolutely great we're using uh state to
315:27 - do a bunch of stuff and that's good now
315:29 - again let's focus back on being able to
315:32 - open the model and close the model this
315:34 - is something very common that you have
315:36 - to do in react and we're going to start
315:38 - working on that now so let's go ahead
315:41 - and get
315:42 - started so where should we get started
315:46 - well the first thing I want to
315:49 - do is um inside of main I'm going to add
315:53 - the ability to hide and show the
315:56 - modal
316:00 - cool so let's go all the way at the top
316:03 - we're going to import State because
316:04 - we're going to need access to it so use
316:07 - state
316:09 - and I'm going to say from
316:11 - react okay now underneath main we going
316:15 - to do show model set show model like
316:20 - this my bad use State and um default is
316:25 - going to be a closed State okay so by
316:28 - default it's going to be just always
316:32 - closed all right now right underneath
316:36 - here let's
316:37 - add the code to make
316:40 - it um hide and show the model so let's
316:43 - get started on that so I'm going to do
316:46 - handle
316:49 - click and here's what we're going to
316:52 - do okay so we're going to start it off
316:55 - by preventing the default Behavior which
316:58 - is important for react so you don't have
317:00 - these weird refreshing things going on
317:02 - when you don't want
317:04 - them okay
317:09 - all
317:10 - right let's go let's stay
317:14 - here outside of our if statement and now
317:17 - I'm going to just add a little switch
317:18 - statement and I'm just going to say show
317:21 - modal all
317:23 - right and in the case that I get an
317:27 - open what I want you to do is the
317:30 - following I want you
317:32 - to set it to
317:35 - close and then
317:37 - break okay
317:39 - in the other case where it's
317:43 - closed then what I want you to do is I
317:46 - want you
317:48 - to say show model to be
317:52 - open
317:55 - okay and
317:57 - break in the case oh actually otherwise
318:02 - let's just do
318:04 - default set show model to be just closed
318:07 - by default
318:09 - okay and then we'll break right
318:11 - there
318:13 - beautiful so that seems simple enough
318:15 - now let's actually go to the button and
318:17 - add that
318:19 - functionality where is my
318:22 - button user SVG yep so start a post
318:26 - that's where we're going to add it so
318:28 - let's go onclick equals and I'm going to
318:31 - say
318:32 - handle handle
318:35 - click okay
318:37 - great and and uh where I have post modal
318:40 - let's scroll down scroll down where I
318:42 - have post modal I'm going to give it
318:45 - show
318:46 - model pass at the current state of the
318:48 - model okay so it's going to take a prop
318:50 - that's show modal prop and we'll add in
318:53 - the functionality for that prop in just
318:55 - a second okay and then the handle click
318:58 - prop it's going to just
319:01 - do handle
319:03 - click actually we're probably just
319:05 - taking in props so we'll probably have
319:06 - to do props do show model and props do
319:09 - handle
319:10 - click so let's go ahead and check that
319:13 - out let's go to post
319:15 - model
319:17 - um dope and inside of my post model I
319:21 - want to do just a few
319:23 - things so right underneath that text
319:27 - that we're editing let's go ahead and do
319:30 - the following I'm going to
319:32 - do going to create a
319:35 - reset all right and this reset is going
319:37 - to take in
319:39 - an event and it's going to set the
319:42 - editor text to be blank and it's also
319:47 - going to
319:49 - handle
319:51 - click and handle the
319:56 - event okay so I'm going to wrap the
320:00 - whole thing in a jsx fragment all the
320:04 - way down to this container here
320:08 - okay so let's just start off with that
320:11 - and then what I'm going to do is I'm
320:13 - also going to wrap the entire thing in
320:15 - these squiggly
320:17 - brackets like
320:19 - this cool now within here what I'm going
320:23 - to say is I'm going to say props do show
320:26 - model equals open if that's true then
320:31 - what I want you to do
320:33 - is show me all of this stuff here
320:38 - okay and uh what I'm going to do to my
320:41 - button let's go to my where is my create
320:44 - a post create a post right so right
320:47 - underneath that I have a
320:49 - button okay and what to that button I'm
320:52 - going to do
320:55 - onclick on click taking an
321:00 - event
321:02 - okay and call my reset function and give
321:07 - it my give it my event okay that's what
321:10 - I want to happen when I click
321:13 - X so
321:16 - now um oh also let's go all the way
321:20 - down and where do I have my
321:23 - SVG inside of my
321:26 - header const header where's my header

321:49 - look at that that worked I can't believe
321:53 - that worked I really thought it was
321:54 - going to break boom
321:58 - boom look at that model and look the
322:01 - whole screen goes dark because that we
322:03 - have that you know that postm modal div
322:06 - that takes over the entire screen when I
322:08 - click it when I hit X it goes and it's
322:12 - done okay that model is a very beautiful

324:33 - to
324:34 - say that's all I got to
324:37 - say all right all right that modal work
324:39 - was
324:41 - just beautiful okay now let's keep going
324:46 - beautiful so now we got that working now
324:48 - we're going to disable the post button
324:50 - when the editor text is um empty okay
324:55 - cuz right now even when the editor text
324:57 - is not empty I can hit post so we don't
325:00 - want that we don't want that okay cool
325:03 - so let's go ahead to post model and
325:06 - let's start adding that functionality so
325:08 - so let's go to our post
325:10 - button and um inside of our post button
325:14 - all I'm going to say is this I'm going
325:15 - to
325:17 - say
325:19 - disabled okay when the editor text state
325:23 - is empty when it just doesn't exist okay
325:26 - if it's so give me true so give me
325:30 - disabled true if the text is empty
325:31 - otherwise give me false cool that's
325:35 - essentially
325:36 - it cool
325:39 - dis a old old D just like
325:45 - that okay so now because of the styling
325:48 - and stuff like that you can't really see
325:50 - it but it's actually disabled right now
325:52 - because there's no borders around it but
325:54 - I type the borders appear okay but it's
325:56 - just like a little hard to see so we're
325:58 - going to go ahead and add some styling
326:00 - to it so let's go
326:02 - to our post button so I'm going to
326:04 - command f post button component and
326:08 - let's add some styling to this so inside
326:12 - of background here's what we're going to
326:15 - do we're going to do some cool ways of
326:17 - styling
326:19 - now props dot this I'm going to do it
326:23 - this way okay let's go get access to the
326:25 - props and if the props is disabled
326:28 - question mark then I want you to style
326:31 - it in this way 000000
326:36 - .8 okay and if you're not disabled then
326:40 - I want you to style it in a different
326:42 - way so like what we had earlier so now
326:46 - this is going to be really freaking
326:49 - cool whoa what the hell happened it
326:51 - looks ugly as
326:53 - hell what the heck
326:56 - happened we lost all of our
326:59 - [Music]
327:01 - styling oh man the app is going all over
327:04 - the place all right let's take that out
327:07 - of parentheses is here um I mean it
327:10 - doesn't really matter but prer wants me
327:13 - to do it the other way oh and why am I
327:16 - going blind let's um close this freaking
327:19 - parenthesis right there right cuz that
327:22 - would only make sense and then that
327:24 - closes
327:26 - that cool ah yeah look at that okay my
327:34 - post is dark I write and now it's blue
327:38 - blue this is why I love styled
327:40 - components you guys because I'm just I'm
327:43 - saying if it's disabled give it this
327:46 - color if it's enabled give it this color
327:49 - and it's just so freaking nice it's just
327:51 - so freaking
327:53 - nice okay um and now I I also want to
327:56 - change the text color Okay so let's go
327:59 - ahead and change the text color cuz
328:00 - right now just white that's not what we
328:02 - want so let's go props and I'm going to
328:05 - go props disabled okay if it's disabled
328:08 - AED then do the
328:10 - following of course open close
328:13 - this okay and then outside of this just
328:17 - give me white okay so when it's disabled
328:21 - it's hard to see it when it's enabled
328:23 - boom okay so that's what it I want that
328:26 - to happen with the colors it's good it's
328:28 - good okay cool and then on Hover I also
328:32 - want to give it a dynamic functionality
328:35 - okay so I'm going to say props
328:38 - and if it's disabled again let's go
328:42 - ahead and
328:43 - do
328:47 - 0000
328:49 - 0.8 like that actually let's do
328:54 - 0.0 0 Yeah
328:57 - 0.08
328:59 - okay
329:01 - or in the other case give
329:05 - me this
329:08 - okay am I closing my parenthesis right
329:10 - yes I am on Hover
329:14 - beautiful okay that's all that's
329:17 - happening cool so when I hover over it
329:20 - gives me a like a lighter gray uh in the
329:22 - disabled mode okay and then when I
329:25 - write then it gives me this one when I
329:28 - hover over on this thing right boom boom
329:31 - boom beautiful that's exactly what I
329:35 - want and that's really really good now
329:38 - we're going to start adding um file
329:40 - input for uploading images and that
329:43 - allows us to upload a file from our
329:45 - computer and add it to this and that's
329:48 - really nice functionality and if you're
329:49 - going to a recruiter you can show them
329:51 - that functionality okay they're going to
329:53 - be blown away so let's go ahead and
329:55 - start adding that
329:57 - now so file input where do we start well
330:00 - we start in post model let's go all the
330:02 - way to the top and right underneath this
330:06 - let's go ahead and add share image
330:09 - set set share
330:12 - image all right and I'm going to go use
330:16 - State leave it
330:18 - blank
330:20 - cool um and then what I want to do is I
330:23 - want to handle the change as it
330:27 - happens okay we're going to get the
330:29 - first element from the
330:31 - files and uh if the image is blank
330:38 - or image
330:41 - is
330:44 - undefined okay and those two
330:46 - cases um I want to basically say
330:51 - hey uh not an image the image file is a
330:56 - and then we're going to be able to
330:58 - access and say type of
331:01 - image cool so that's going to be great
331:04 - this is going to help me figure out like
331:06 - what the actual error is is and what's
331:08 - the type of the
331:10 - image and then
331:12 - otherwise I'm just going to
331:19 - return and I'm going to return right
331:22 - here
331:24 - return cool and now right underneath
331:27 - that let's go set share
331:30 - image image okay so meaning if we don't
331:34 - get an error then do this
331:36 - thing and when I do this thing it's
331:39 - going to update that variable right
331:41 - there share image
331:44 - cool cool cool cool cool beans now let's
331:47 - go ahead and actually add the upload
331:49 - image component so I'll add the upload
331:53 - image
331:54 - component uh kind of right underneath uh
331:57 - the text
331:58 - area all right so text area what I'm
332:01 - going to do is I'm going to remove this
332:03 - and I'm just going to end it right there
332:04 - so just a little bit tad bit clean
332:08 - and right underneath the text area I'm
332:10 - going to add the upload image
332:14 - component okay and let's just go ahead
332:16 - and give it a empty styling for now
332:19 - before we start uh doing other things to
332:21 - it upload image is equal to
332:24 - styled div and just leave it empty for
332:26 - now that way we don't get into errors as
332:28 - I'm writing it so you can see it build
332:31 - out upload image right
332:34 - there and um let's go input
332:39 - type type is going to be
332:42 - file so already just by doing type file
332:45 - for input I can now choose file and it
332:48 - brings up all of this stuff which is
332:50 - super
332:51 - cool all right so that's
332:56 - good and I can even click choose file
332:59 - and click an image and it automatically
333:01 - knows Disney plus ASMR right it it says
333:04 - it right there that's that's a really
333:06 - good sign so like things are already
333:08 - kind of
333:09 - working uh I'm going to say
333:12 - accept um and let's
333:15 - say accept what
333:18 - accept uh image slash GIF so accept
333:23 - images and
333:24 - gifs and also um
333:28 - accept
333:31 - jpegs and also I'll have it accept
333:35 - pngs Okay like
333:38 - this so that's
333:41 - good go name is equal to image the ID of
333:47 - this will be
333:49 - file cool of this input and then let's
333:53 - give it a style and I'll give it a jsx
333:58 - inline styling okay and I'm going to say
334:02 - display um
334:05 - none Okay so if I remove that style you
334:09 - see choose file if I REM if I add
334:13 - display none now that choose file is
334:16 - just not showing cuz I I said don't
334:18 - display it right if I change it with
334:20 - something else it's going to have
334:21 - different Behavior cool all
334:25 - right so that's good now on change we
334:29 - need to add something that actually
334:32 - handles on change okay so let's
334:35 - go on change we're going to handle on
334:40 - change okay so it's going to run our
334:42 - handle change function which is going to
334:44 - do all of this which is going to set the
334:46 - image for
334:48 - us cool
334:53 - cool let's so now we're closing out of
334:57 - that input that's good all right so that
335:00 - input should end right there right
335:02 - underneath that we'll add a paragraph
335:05 - tag and in here let's add a
335:10 - label okay and HTML 4 will just be
335:15 - file and now let's give it a style okay
335:19 - and again we'll also do this one in line
335:22 - as well for styling just please bear
335:25 - with me this is going to be a little
335:26 - hard to follow but bear with me here and
335:30 - I'm just going to say cursor pointer but
335:31 - actually you know what I don't even
335:33 - think we need that to be honest I'm just
335:35 - going to leave that that will make it
335:37 - simp simpler for you and then let's just
335:39 - say inside of the label let's just
335:45 - say
335:47 - select a image Let's do an image to
335:51 - share like
335:53 - that okay so now there is our styling
335:56 - very very simple okay and when I click
335:59 - it okay
336:02 - already um it actually opens this up
336:06 - okay so but what we have to do is
336:07 - probably make it look like something
336:08 - that you want to click on so we're going
336:11 - to do that in just a
336:13 - second all right let's end our label
336:16 - we're ending our label that's good and
336:18 - right underneath ending our label we're
336:20 - ending our P tag that's
336:23 - good now let's right underneath our P
336:26 - tag but in still inside our upload image
336:29 - component let's add in these squigglies
336:32 - and we're going to do share image so if
336:35 - the image actually exists then do the
336:40 - following okay and I'm going to say
336:43 - image source is equal to and I'm going
336:48 - to say url.
336:50 - create object
336:53 - URL and I'm going to pass
336:57 - this the share image
337:00 - path okay like that let's close our
337:05 - image
337:06 - tag beew
337:08 - beautiful okay boom boom wo a our imag

337:23 - good let's go down upload
337:26 - image now let's add this component
337:29 - styling all the way at the bottom for
337:31 - upload image because right now the image
337:33 - is ridiculous right so we're just going
337:35 - to need to control that so let's go text
337:37 - line Center and then after this so now
337:41 - select an image to share is looking
337:43 - good okay and of course now what we want
337:46 - to do is we want to say hey the image

338:28 - able to actually show like any video
338:31 - URLs that we put okay that's going to
338:34 - like kind of Auto expand them and make
338:36 - them look great so let's go ahead and do
338:38 - that cool so let's start working on it
338:41 - now first things we need is we actually
338:43 - I'm going to hit control C and stop my
338:45 - server and what we actually need is you
338:47 - can do npm
338:48 - install like this but I'm actually going
338:50 - to do yarn ad which is the same thing uh
338:54 - and I'm going to do yarn add react Das
338:57 - player okay and hit enter so install um

339:08 - but yeah install this so now you should
339:09 - have react
339:11 - player okay the react player
339:13 - library and uh let's go inside of our
339:16 - post modal and go all the way at the top
339:18 - and I'm going to do import react player
339:22 - from react player like this cool and
339:27 - right underneath here we're going to say
339:30 - const video link and then we're going to
339:32 - say set video link like this equal use
339:36 - State and leave that blank okay
339:41 - cool now inside of our handle

340:03 - me think so let's keep this inside of
340:06 - our up upload image but right underneath
340:09 - where we're doing the share image line
340:11 - okay so right here we're going to do a
340:15 - couple of things I'm going to add a
340:17 - empty react J jss jsx
340:22 - fragment okay and inside of this let's
340:26 - add an
340:28 - input uh we're going to keep it text and
340:32 - placeholder will be please input a video
340:36 - link like
340:39 - that and then the value will be whatever
340:42 - is the video link that we give it and of
340:46 - course on change we're going to
340:51 - say take the
340:53 - event and set the video URL set the
340:56 - video link based on whatever the user
340:59 - gives you okay the value of the
341:03 - event
341:04 - great so input ends
341:09 - here and right underneath input what
341:12 - we're going to do is open close
341:14 - squiggly and I'm going to say if video
341:16 - link
341:17 - exists then what I want you to do okay
341:21 - and let's close this bracket and go
341:24 - react
341:27 - player all right and I just imported it
341:30 - so I imported import react player from
341:33 - react Das player so make sure you go
341:34 - ahead and do that let's say react player
341:37 - width is equal
341:39 - to
341:42 - 10 uh let's go
341:44 - 100% okay and then we're going to go

341:52 - actually set in our state at the moment
341:54 - okay
341:55 - save
341:59 - beautiful so that should be pretty good
342:02 - all right now we're going to test it out
342:05 - and see if it if it does
342:08 - anything whoops let's do yarn start
342:11 - again so it starts up our
342:13 - app okay wake up app

342:38 - let's go 20% on the width so that made
342:40 - it really really tiny just like this so
342:43 - make sure choose 100% on your react
342:45 - player width so react player plays
342:48 - really nicely with
342:50 - videos okay so we're good now we're
342:53 - going to make it so you can switch
342:55 - between share image or share video all
342:58 - right here we go welcome back to the
343:02 - same thing that you were on so let's
343:04 - just continue going all right I just
343:06 - want to take a a little break but it's
343:08 - all good we're back now and we're ready
343:10 - to go okay can I hear myself beautiful
343:14 - awesome so let's just go ahead and get
343:16 - started with this right so so far we're
343:18 - doing a great job we got the video
343:20 - player showing we got me looking
343:23 - beautiful here right there okay maybe
343:25 - for you it's your video that you're
343:27 - putting okay you you can use your own
343:28 - YouTube video link and then it'll be you
343:32 - with that said let's go ahead and make
343:34 - it so we can switch between whichever
343:36 - one we want right because right now
343:39 - we're seeing both image and the YouTube
343:42 - url I don't want to see both of them I
343:44 - just want to see one of them okay cool
343:46 - so let's go ahead and add that
343:48 - functionality okay now the functionality
343:49 - is going to take a little bit so first
343:52 - things first we're going to start off by
343:54 - going inside of our post model so make
343:56 - sure you're there and uh right here
343:59 - we're going to add that component okay
344:01 - so not component we're going to add um a
344:05 - state variable here okay because this is
344:07 - going to change at some point so asset
344:09 - area and then of course the um the way
344:12 - that we are using it is going to be set
344:14 - asset area cool just like this this a
344:17 - convention we use and default is going
344:20 - to be empty cool now let's go under
344:24 - where we have set share image okay
344:27 - underneath that we're going to make a
344:30 - new function here that we're going to
344:32 - use switch asset area cool it'll take
344:37 - take in the area as an argument and then
344:40 - it's going to do a couple of things so
344:42 - it's going to make
344:44 - the um image just empty we'll also do
344:48 - set video link and we'll make that empty
344:52 - cool and then we're going to do set
344:54 - asset area to the area that we received
345:00 - okay and uh that's all good okay awesome
345:05 - now let's go to our reset in in our
345:09 - reset we're just going to add a few more
345:11 - things okay but we're going to add that
345:14 - above our handle Click Change okay so
345:17 - I'm going to do set share image let's go
345:21 - blank here set video link will go blank
345:24 - because again this is reset so this
345:26 - should reset essentially all of those
345:28 - States so that's all we're doing there
345:31 - now let's go down under where we have
345:34 - the area focus in our text area Okay so
345:39 - right below this I'm going to do a
345:42 - couple of
345:43 - things okay uh what I'm going to do is
345:46 - let's open up our squiggly bracket here
345:50 - okay and um let's go ahead let's go
345:55 - ahead and U what I'm going to do is I'm
345:57 - going to close the squiggly bracket kind
345:59 - of in this weird area right underneath
346:01 - this jsx the jsx fragment that's ending
346:05 - right underneath this um
346:07 - player that's where I'm going to add the
346:10 - ending of that okay and essentially
346:14 - we're going to have a Turner operator in
346:17 - between there so let's do this okay so
346:20 - if asset area is equal to image then I
346:25 - want the following to happen all right
346:28 - oops image then I
346:31 - want this all of this to happen Okay uh
346:35 - the upload image thing to show
346:38 - up okay um all right guys so I'm going
346:43 - to take this where this upload imag is
346:46 - ending I'm going to take it okay I'm
346:48 - going to take this thing here and let's
346:51 - move it up okay so boom boom boom let's
346:56 - go up top and uh let's end this
346:59 - component right here okay the upload
347:02 - image component and here's where I'm
347:05 - going to add my erary so I'm going to do
347:08 - colon here this is a little hard to
347:11 - read and um and I apologize about that
347:14 - but bear with me here and then I'm going
347:16 - to say if the asset area is Media then I
347:20 - want you to do the following okay in
347:23 - that case do all of this so again a
347:27 - little hard to read but I'm basically
347:30 - saying if it's image then do all of this
347:34 - okay the upload image component okay if
347:37 - the asset area is Media then do all of
347:40 - this okay great and then let's go ahead
347:44 - and just switch a couple of things so
347:46 - I'm going to find my asset button and
347:48 - all I'm going to do for my asset button
347:51 - is very simple I will simply add an
347:55 - onclick on this thing like this let's
347:58 - open this up go like that beautiful and
348:01 - I'm going to do switch asset area like
348:04 - so and uh pass in image okay give it
348:09 - pass in the image for that and then
348:11 - where's my other asset button right here
348:14 - this is the one for the video and I'm
348:17 - just going to say on click and uh we're
348:20 - going to do switch asset area and I'm
348:24 - just going to say media like
348:26 - so okay and then that should be pretty
348:30 - freaking good great pretty freaking cool
348:34 - wow look at that it's working and it
348:36 - looks nice right when I click the image
348:38 - I see this when I click this one I see
348:41 - this video right there okay and how is
348:44 - that working well uh this is this is uh
348:49 - one AET button which is right here and
348:52 - this is asset button number two this
348:54 - video one okay so we got one and two
348:58 - I'll write one and two just like so okay
349:02 - this image one is this one the one and
349:04 - this media one is this video one now
349:07 - what happens when I click this video one
349:11 - or sorry this picture one is this
349:14 - onclick thing runs and it changes my
349:19 - state variable this asset area one and
349:22 - it changes it to image okay so well
349:24 - let's go into that function and see what
349:26 - that's doing okay it changes it to an
349:30 - image okay so I go switch asset area and
349:33 - I pass it the image and then it just
349:35 - changes it to an image all right and
349:40 - that makes the code appear and work and
349:42 - do do essentially what I want it to do
349:45 - okay if I go and do switch asset area to
349:49 - Media it goes ahead and changes it to a
349:52 - media okay and then boom you get your uh
349:55 - switching statements here boom and here
349:58 - I can put my video link to a YouTube
350:00 - video like so and it will actually even
350:03 - put the video here okay and let's test
350:06 - put put an image and let's see if our
350:08 - image Works beautiful our image is
350:11 - working and that's exactly what we want
350:14 - so we're done with that functionality
350:16 - now we're going to connect with our
350:18 - store and uh get user info okay so let's
350:22 - go down first of all let's actually just
350:24 - import so I'm going to do import connect
350:27 - because we're going to need to connect
350:29 - to our Redux store in a second so let's
350:32 - do this okay all right so now we're
350:35 - going to map states to props the boring
350:38 - usual Redux stuff which you know Redux
350:41 - toolkit you don't need to know how to do
350:44 - going do map state to props State and um
350:49 - actually this is going to be an
350:51 - expression like
350:53 - that okay let's leave it empty for
350:56 - now and um I'm just going to do export
350:59 - default connect map state to props we'll
351:03 - do map dispatch
351:07 - uh dispatch to props okay and then we'll
351:11 - do Post modal like that actually my bad
351:17 - okay uh this is this one is going to be
351:19 - map dispatch
351:21 - map dispatch to props okay and uh that's
351:28 - going to be good for the dispatch to
351:30 - props and above this I'm going to add
351:33 - map state to props
351:37 - okay and we'll make this state now this
351:39 - one is going to be
351:41 - dispatch okay so this one that says
351:45 - State cool let's go like this all right
351:49 - I like putting parentheses here
351:51 - hopefully prettier likes it too great
351:54 - and what I'm going to do is say return
351:57 - user State user state. State like that
352:02 - okay so now that should be good to go
352:05 - that's that all right now we're going to
352:07 - display the user info so let's go to
352:11 - user info component which is up here and
352:15 - we're going to add our little Turner
352:17 - action and let's go ahead and do that
352:23 - now
352:24 - okay so I'm going to say props do user.
352:28 - photo URL so hey if the photo URL is
352:31 - there then I want you to do the
352:34 - following then I want you to show the
352:36 - image and the source for this is going
352:39 - to be the actual URL for the photo props
352:44 - do user. photo URL like so all right and
352:49 - um I don't need to do anything else I
352:52 - think that should be good cool let's end
352:55 - this photo
352:57 - one okay and then we need an or
353:00 - statement so an or
353:02 - statement I'm going to basically give it
353:05 - this as my or statement and then we need
353:07 - to end this
353:10 - squiggly okay so what is my error here
353:15 - let's
353:16 - see I think I'm ending it too early so
353:18 - let's remove
353:20 - that
353:21 - there so basically I'm saying hey does
353:24 - the photo exist if it exists of the user
353:26 - then show the photo of the actual user
353:30 - that we pulled from Firebase otherwise
353:31 - show this Anonymous user photo so let's
353:34 - click the post the modal
353:37 - okay now it's having an error cannot
353:38 - read property photo URL of undefined
353:42 - okay no
353:43 - problem um so what basically needs to
353:47 - happen is I need to right now actually
353:49 - I'm logged
353:50 - in logged
353:52 - in okay weird error we'll figure it out
353:56 - together not to worry okay let's H save
354:00 - on this thing and then let's go ahead
354:02 - underneath here we got our span tag and
354:05 - then our ban what I'm going to say is
354:08 - props user.
354:10 - display name okay just like
354:17 - that
354:20 - great and of course we got to close our
354:23 - squiggly otherwise we're going to be in
354:25 - some
354:28 - troubles cool so let's try signing out
354:31 - let's try signing in with Google
354:37 - okay cannot read property photo URL of
354:42 - undefined
354:44 - interesting cuz pretty sure we're
354:46 - freaking logged in oh duh this is why I
354:51 - don't have access to the
354:54 - user I got to access the freaking user
354:58 - okay that's what user is okay state.
355:01 - user state. user okay so now up here
355:07 - here where I'm asking for the user
355:10 - command
355:13 - fuser okay where I want to get the
355:16 - user's photo now I have access to the
355:18 - user's photo so let's hit save let's hit
355:22 - refresh and now I'm going to have access
355:24 - to the user's photo okay so for example
355:26 - let's Click Boom there we go okay so now
355:30 - let's go full screen here okay click
355:33 - Start a post and if you're logged in
355:35 - we'll have a photo here if you're not
355:37 - logged in you shouldn't even be able to
355:39 - get to this page but if you did get to
355:41 - this page you'll have this Anonymous
355:43 - photo as a fallback okay so great now we
355:47 - got that photo now let's add
355:49 - functionality with the image okay we
355:51 - want to be able to actually upload the
355:53 - image to Firebase storage so let's go
355:55 - ahead and do that now so first things
355:59 - first well what are the first things
356:01 - first so let's go to actions cuz we're
356:05 - going to add an action and uh we're
356:08 - going to add a new
356:09 - action okay it's going to be called Post
356:12 - article API and it will take in a
356:16 - payload okay and I'm just going to
356:19 - return a dispatch
356:21 - event that's going to look like the
356:23 - following okay um if what I want to do
356:27 - is payload is uh payload do image is not
356:32 - blank so we have an image then I'm I'm
356:36 - going to set my upload to be
356:39 - storage. ref whoops storage. ref
356:45 - okay Images
356:49 - slash payload image. name
356:54 - okay and then let's get out of here and
356:57 - we're going to use theut
357:00 - method and we'll do payload do image
357:06 - cool so this is going to help us upload
357:10 - our
357:11 - image all right and uh let's go ahead
357:15 - and make sure that we do that all right
357:18 - now let's
357:21 - do
357:23 - upload okay and I'll do upload.
357:26 - on cool on state
357:32 - changed okay then we're going to do snap
357:38 - shot all right let's go
357:42 - and not that one let's go like that
357:45 - snapshot I'm going to say cons progress
357:49 - is the
357:51 - following going to have snapshot
357:55 - bytes
357:59 - transferred
358:00 - boom and we'll do snapshot. total bytes
358:06 - byes just like that all right and let's
358:09 - multiply that by 100 and close it
358:13 - off
358:16 - cool all right now this is going to be
358:20 - helpful for making that loading bar soon
358:23 - and I you guys will see how this is
358:25 - actually going to help you okay so now
358:29 - boom we have this one right
358:33 - here let's just wrap this thing in
358:36 - inside of paren right
358:39 - here um it doesn't need it okay it's
358:42 - redundant
358:45 - cool let's get out of here and now let's
358:48 - basically go console
358:50 - log uh
358:54 - progress okay and I'll do
359:00 - this
359:02 - progress okay and we'll put a percent
359:05 - sign
359:06 - so that'll show us how's our progress
359:09 - doing so
359:11 - far I don't want my function to be
359:14 - ending here so this upload
359:19 - on needed to be ending a little bit
359:23 - later all right so we're going to need
359:26 - quite a lot of uh little weird changes
359:29 - here so just follow along um gets messy
359:32 - okay
359:34 - so uh open a par pareses here and we're
359:36 - going to close this okay cuz this whole
359:38 - thing is an
359:40 - expression then I'm going to console log
359:42 - the progress and then what I'm want to
359:44 - do is I want to essentially close out
359:47 - everything right so for example this
359:48 - squiggly here let's close that out that
359:53 - parenthesis right there I'm going to
359:54 - close that out I also want to close this
359:58 - squiggly right there okay and then I
360:02 - also want to close that squiggly out
360:03 - right there and I also want toose CL
360:06 - that squiggly out right there and uh
360:09 - that should effectively take care of
360:11 - everything and once I hit
360:13 - save it should kind of format it like
360:15 - this okay but there's a couple of things
360:18 - that we got to do here all right now
360:20 - underneath this what I want to basically
360:23 - say is if the
360:25 - snapshot state is running on the other
360:29 - hand
360:31 - okay then what I want to do is I want to
360:34 - console log the
360:39 - progress okay progress like
360:43 - this and
360:48 - boom cool so in both cases kind of show
360:52 - me show me what's going
360:55 - on okay and then let's go underneath
361:00 - here okay right
361:03 - there and what I will say is if there's
361:06 - an error then console.log
361:10 - error
361:15 - code
361:17 - okay so again I know there's a lot going
361:20 - on in this upload
361:23 - so there there's a lot right so for
361:26 - example this upload function it took in
361:29 - this state change then it took in this
361:32 - function right here on the Fly and then
361:34 - it's also taking in
361:36 - uh what needs to happen when there's an
361:39 - error
361:44 - okay cool and then let's also do
361:52 - async okay we're going to have download
361:55 - URL and what that's going to do is we're
361:56 - going to wait
362:01 - upload cool and we're going to do get
362:05 - download URL like
362:07 - so
362:09 - okay all right so storage is not defined
362:13 - we will Define storage by importing it
362:16 - okay so let's go ahead up at the top and
362:18 - in here right after provider I'm going
362:21 - to upload storage from Firebase that'll
362:24 - take care of that we also want to add
362:26 - our database let's do import DB
362:30 - from Firebase we're going to need that
362:34 - later okay
362:36 - cool let's come on down now and we got
362:39 - our download URL so that's good now we
362:43 - need to do a couple of things so right
362:45 - underneath this download URL we're going
362:47 - to do our DB collection okay so DB
362:52 - collection articles to the Articles
362:56 - collection we're going to add the
362:58 - following the actor it's going to have
363:02 - the following things in here description
363:04 - will be payload of the user
363:09 - email
363:10 - title will
363:13 - be display name like
363:16 - so date will be whatever is the
363:19 - timestamp of the
363:21 - payload and then image will
363:24 - be the photo URL of course
363:29 - okay great and then underneath Here
363:33 - video will be payload video
363:37 - shared image will be the download
363:41 - URL that we made comments will be zero
363:44 - we'll kind of just hard code that for
363:46 - now and description will be the
363:49 - payload
363:52 - description okay so that should be good
363:57 - I know that that was like a pretty hefty
363:59 - piece of code but let's go to our post
364:02 - modal and now actually add that
364:04 - functionality in we're pretty close
364:07 - so hang in there with me guys let's
364:08 - import Firebase from
364:14 - Firebase okay and then we're going to
364:17 - import our Post
364:19 - article API like
364:22 - so and let's do from dot dot
364:27 - actions
364:29 - okay so that gets us that now let's go
364:33 - where our switch asset area shows
364:38 - up
364:39 - cool and um let's add in our new method
364:44 - okay or function here Post
364:48 - article okay it's going to take an
364:52 - event and again I want to Def kind of
364:55 - prevent um any of the weird stuff
364:57 - happening in react where things need to
364:59 - refresh and so on so let's take care of
365:02 - that and I'm basically going to say if
365:03 - the target
365:05 - does not equal to the current Target
365:08 - then just
365:12 - return
365:14 - cool and then I'm going to Define our
365:17 - payload and image will be the share
365:21 - image video will be the video
365:26 - link our user will be our
365:31 - actual
365:32 - user description
365:36 - description will be whatever the text is
365:41 - that the user adds and of course
365:44 - timestamp will
365:46 - be Firebase
365:50 - timestamp okay so that's why we imported
365:54 - Firebase and
365:56 - then here we're going to have props
366:00 - dot Post
366:02 - article and that's going to take the
366:04 - payload
366:06 - okay and then simply let's go ahead and
366:09 - reset e and then we'll call this
366:12 - function and we'll reset everything okay
366:14 - once it's added and now let's basically
366:17 - go ahead and add these
366:19 - buttons so going to go down to my post
366:23 - button and inside of my post
366:28 - button when I click that
366:31 - button I want a couple of things to
366:34 - happen
366:36 - okay so let's go here and we'll Define
366:39 - an
366:42 - onclick just leave it blank for a second
366:45 - and in our on click what I want to
366:47 - happen is I'm going to give it an
366:52 - event and then I want the following
366:54 - things to
366:58 - occur run our Post article function and
367:01 - give it the event details okay
367:05 - that means the description the text any
367:08 - information that we have already about
367:10 - the user and now just let's go to our
367:14 - dispatch and add all of that in cool so
367:18 - let's go here and let's add in that so
367:21 - Post
367:23 - article and we will do it'll take in a
367:27 - payload okay and then we'll
367:30 - dispatch Post article
367:34 - API pay load like
367:38 - that okay beautiful
367:41 - now let's see if it actually does
367:44 - anything for now so I will take an image
367:48 - select an image click an image do
367:52 - that test let's hit
367:56 - post post so maybe it's doing something
368:00 - maybe it isn't but the only way to go
368:02 - and check is to go inside of our fire
368:05 - store database and let's see if anything
368:08 - is actually
368:09 - happening okay so let's go ahead and
368:12 - create a database I'll put it in test
368:14 - mode let's hit next and
368:19 - enable all right that's going to be
368:21 - important because that allows our
368:22 - database to actually be created in the
368:24 - first place otherwise we will not have a
368:27 - database and Fir store is actually very
368:30 - very
368:31 - powerful so I like using this as our
368:35 - database base
368:37 - okay all right now we don't have any
368:40 - collections or anything like
368:42 - that so let's try hitting post again
368:46 - does that do
368:48 - anything nope not doing anything right
368:52 - now which is totally
368:54 - fine and by the way fire store also has
368:58 - storage okay so I'm going to click on
369:00 - that I'm going to go in there so on the
369:02 - left hand side I have storage and I can
369:04 - even up a file right so let's just click
369:07 - here upload a file see what happens I'm
369:08 - just kind of like hardcoding it and
369:10 - uploading it there okay so boom it
369:12 - uploaded it and now we'll be able to
369:14 - retrieve file from here okay so that's
369:16 - the file
369:18 - data it's kind of nice uh goey that they
369:21 - have actually for uploading uh things so
369:25 - pretty uh simple but that's just kind of
369:27 - like I'm me hardcoding it okay but
369:28 - that's not the way we're going to do
369:30 - what we're going to do in our app oh and
369:33 - going back to index file by the way our
369:37 - actions
369:38 - index.js um this is squiggly okay not
369:44 - parentheses that's why it's not changing
369:47 - uh that's why it's actually not using
369:50 - that variable okay this is like template
369:52 - literals so that's how they work boom
369:55 - let's
369:56 - refresh
369:58 - cool okay let's try uploading the image
370:02 - now hopefully that works Let's test test
370:04 - test test
370:07 - test okay if it works it'll probably
370:11 - upload it to our um storage folder
370:14 - inside of our Firebase okay so let's
370:16 - keep on trying this thing all right so
370:19 - let's actually debug this real quick
370:21 - together because I think that's going to
370:22 - be helpful so let's go inside of Post
370:25 - article and I'm going to type in console
370:28 - log uh post
370:31 - Malone all right let's uh add a rocket
370:34 - here
370:37 - okay it's not going to add a rocket so
370:38 - let's just add a person here that's
370:41 - fine all right so I have my image I'm
370:43 - going to hit post and it says post
370:46 - Malone so I want to see where it's
370:48 - getting to so it's getting to this line
370:50 - let's now add a console log here and I'm
370:53 - just going to say can I add add a cake
370:56 - here let's add that cake I don't know
370:59 - why it's being funny but I'm just going
371:00 - to say hello here okay and uh let's see
371:04 - if it gets in here
371:07 - uhoh ah okay so it seems like it's
371:12 - getting to this if statement and then
371:14 - it's just returning so it's actually not
371:16 - doing any of this and it's not running
371:18 - this Post article payload function cuz
371:21 - that Post article payload actually
371:24 - does everything that we need to do it
371:27 - actually does this Post article right we
371:29 - give it the payload it dispatches it and
371:32 - then it gives it to this function this
371:33 - function knows how to up load so it's
371:35 - never even getting to that it's just
371:37 - dying right
371:39 - here and that's because e. Target is not
371:42 - equal correct Target this should be
371:44 - current Target okay so I'm going to hit
371:48 - delete here um and now it should not be
371:52 - getting to that hello so let's try again
371:54 - and look progress zero progress 28
371:57 - progress 85 progress 100% wow so that
372:00 - actually looks good looks like something
372:02 - happened so I'm going to go to my
372:04 - Firebase refresh is it in my
372:06 - storage or is it in my database oh it's
372:09 - in my storage I oh that's cool I have an
372:14 - images folder and here's my image Gatsby
372:17 - versus nextjs okay
372:19 - beautiful it is is it also in my
372:21 - database yes it is I have a collections
372:24 - here so I'm going to delete this other
372:26 - uh record I had um actually let me just
372:30 - leave that I just had like some dummy
372:32 - freaking record okay so delete
372:35 - um I don't know if it deletes the whole
372:37 - thing or not it's not deleting it that's
372:38 - fine so just forget about that one but
372:40 - it just added this new record here in my
372:43 - collection articles okay how do I know
372:45 - that well if I go to my code inside of
372:47 - my index.js I have this line here that
372:50 - says hey um DB collection articles
372:54 - inside of Firebase add and then add this
372:57 - whole thing okay so we
373:00 - got actor and actor has all these things
373:03 - inside of it right
373:05 - right and then I also got just video
373:09 - shared image and comments so video
373:12 - shared image description and comments
373:14 - cool which is corresponds to these four
373:16 - things and then actor and all of that
373:19 - corresponds to all of this okay so that
373:25 - looks good to me so far now finally it's
373:28 - working and this progress bar is working
373:30 - so that's really good progress on our
373:32 - end now let's add the same post
373:35 - functionality but with video as well
373:37 - okay and how we're going to do that is
373:39 - it's going to be very simple so remember
373:42 - how we have this if statement right here
373:44 - that says payload
373:47 - image well what we're going to do is say
373:50 - let's find where that
373:51 - ends right there okay and um I'm just
373:55 - going to do else if be careful with the
373:59 - indentation otherwise you're going to
374:00 - get caught okay and I'm going to say if
374:02 - payload is video then I'm going to do DB
374:06 - collection and essentially I'm going to
374:08 - do the same thing which is going to be
374:10 - articles. add okay and we're going to do
374:14 - actor
374:17 - description pay. user.
374:21 - email title I'm just going to copy some
374:24 - of these okay title is going to
374:28 - be
374:30 - that uh date is going to be whoops
374:33 - didn't mean to delete it
374:37 - it okay so paste and then I'm going to
374:42 - copy copy image and also paste it right
374:46 - here okay so those are going to be the
374:48 - same and um also this whole thing pretty
374:53 - much is also going to be the same video
374:56 - payload video shared image so the
374:59 - there's going to be only one difference
375:01 - though okay so I'll show you that in
375:02 - just a second let's hit save now instead
375:05 - of shared image being the download URL
375:07 - it's just going to be empty because it's
375:08 - not an
375:10 - image cool capiche makes sense okay
375:15 - great so that's it that's all that
375:18 - happens if we choose to add a video
375:21 - instead of an image okay so let's try
375:25 - adding let's go here and
375:28 - refresh and let's go here try adding a
375:31 - video We'll add a YouTube video test hit
375:35 - post and uh hopefully something
375:42 - happens let's go to our
375:44 - app did it add a video yes it added a
375:48 - video right there okay it's inside of
375:51 - our database we'll be able to get access
375:54 - to it whenever we want so on and so
375:58 - forth okay cool now we're going to add
376:02 - in an article reducer and this is going
376:04 - to be helpful for when we actually want
376:06 - to start pulling the Articles and
376:08 - actually showing the Articles okay so
376:10 - let's go ahead and start working on that
376:12 - so I'm going
376:14 - to go inside of my reducers so
376:19 - Source reducers going into my reducers
376:21 - folder and we are going to create a new
376:24 - file and it's going to be called article
376:26 - reducer
376:28 - DJs AKA article updator okay much better
376:32 - name for a reducer and I'm just going to
376:35 - say export const innit State like
376:40 - this loading is false okay so the
376:44 - initial state is going to be loading is
376:46 - false so we won't we shouldn't see that
376:48 - loading Circle in the
376:52 - start okay my article
376:54 - reducer what that's going to be is hey
376:57 - my initial State let's make it the NIT
377:01 - State and then it's going to take in an
377:03 - action whoops my bad
377:06 - there we go and then we're going to take
377:09 - a switch based on the action type that's
377:12 - just how Redux works okay and again
377:15 - default is going to be just returning
377:17 - the existing state and I'm going to
377:20 - export default
377:22 - article reducer like so now let's go
377:26 - inside of our index JS which is inside
377:28 - of reducer so the index JS inside of
377:31 - reducer so go to that and uh right
377:35 - underneath this user reducer I'm going
377:37 - to add in an article
377:42 - reducer like
377:44 - that and underneath my root reducer I'm
377:47 - going to add um so user state is good
377:51 - just going to add article
377:53 - State and we will do article
377:56 - reducer like
377:58 - so all right so that's good now we're
378:02 - going to start working on the loading
378:04 - bar okay so we can see the loading bar
378:07 - uh showing up as
378:09 - we um you know upload a video or an
378:13 - image we want to see like a little
378:15 - spinning circular loading
378:18 - bar so let's start with going into our
378:22 - action
378:24 - type.jpg
378:26 - so this is going to be export cons set
378:30 - loading undor
378:33 - status equals set loading status like
378:39 - that okay
378:41 - [Music]
378:42 - beautiful and let's go inside of our
378:45 - article
378:47 - reducer
378:49 - okay and I'm going to do one thing
378:52 - inside of my article reducers which is
378:53 - I'm going to add an import statement at
378:55 - the top and I'm going to say
378:57 - import
378:59 - set set loading
379:03 - status
379:06 - from actions action type okay so let's
379:11 - import that one and then we're going to
379:13 - do underneath
379:15 - our action type let's go ahead and do
379:19 - that so I'm going to say
379:21 - case set loading
379:24 - status okay and I'm going to say a
379:27 - return whatever the state previously was
379:30 - and then add this new loading State on
379:32 - top of that okay
379:36 - keep in mind because this say Redux
379:37 - nothing is being
379:39 - mutated now let's go to our index not
379:43 - that index let's go to our actions
379:45 - index.js there's just so many
379:48 - indexes okay so this import right here
379:52 - we're going to do set user and also set
379:54 - loading
379:56 - status and let's go underneath
380:01 - our um we can kind of add this wherever
380:05 - we want but I'll just add it
380:08 - here
380:10 - okay let's let's just add it right there
380:14 - okay and um I'm going to just do export
380:20 - constant set loading is equal to it take
380:24 - in status as an
380:28 - input and we'll do type set loading oops
380:33 - set loading
380:35 - status status is going to be whatever
380:38 - the status we pass
380:40 - it okay and now let's go inside of our
380:44 - function uh Post article
380:46 - API and right underneath this return
380:49 - dispatch I'm going to say
380:53 - dispatch set loading to be
380:58 - true great let's give a little Gap here
381:02 - just so it looks
381:03 - cleaner great now let's go to our image
381:08 - and our image if statement right go all
381:12 - the way down to where we have the
381:13 - payload do
381:16 - description okay and right underneath
381:18 - that I'm going to say
381:19 - dispatch set loading
381:22 - false okay so once all of that happens
381:26 - we're going to say finish the loading
381:28 - meaning we'll keep spinning keep
381:29 - spinning keep spinning until the whole
381:32 - thing is uploaded and added to our
381:34 - articles as soon as it's added to our
381:37 - articles in our Firebase database then
381:40 - stop the spinning okay dispatch an
381:42 - action to our Redux store change the
381:45 - state of the set loading got it and then
381:48 - we're going to do the same thing for the
381:50 - when the video uh is done being uploaded
381:53 - so these are the two parts where we're
381:55 - going to switch the loading
381:57 - to essentially false and for it to stop
382:02 - spinning okay
382:06 - beautiful now next up we're going to
382:10 - like add our spinning logos and things
382:12 - like that okay so here's the spinning
382:14 - logo it's going to be called spin loader
382:17 - this is what it is okay spin loader. SVG
382:19 - the it already comes in with the graphic
382:21 - of the spinning so we won't need to do
382:23 - any like fancy CSS so that's a good
382:26 - thing all right take it and add it to
382:28 - your images and then we're going to x
382:31 - out of
382:32 - it okay and now we're going to go to
382:35 - main.js so we can add that there okay so
382:39 - let's go to where our share boox is
382:41 - because it's going to be inside of
382:42 - sharebox so inside of sharebox we have
382:46 - uh we don't need this text here by the
382:48 - way anymore share let's hit
382:52 - refresh cool so that share word is gone
382:56 - great okay now I'm going to add in a
383:00 - squiggly
383:01 - here okay and I'm going to close this
383:04 - squiggly uh where should I close this
383:07 - squiggly I'll close
383:12 - it let me think about where to close it
383:16 - actually so let's just close this
383:18 - squiggly right underneath here okay and
383:23 - what I'm basically going to say is hey
383:25 - if the user
383:27 - exists then show the user photo like
383:32 - that okay
383:35 - and then here's what I want you to do if
383:37 - the user photo URL exists then again
383:42 - this is a Turner operator we're going to
383:45 - do
383:48 - this show me the actual user
383:54 - photo end okay um
383:59 - otherwise show me just their Anonymous
384:03 - photo
384:09 - okay beautiful I'm going to T take that
384:11 - div and uh let's put it right underneath
384:14 - the share box okay just like that so now
384:19 - what it should look like is we have one
384:22 - div inside of
384:24 - here what happens is we either see the
384:27 - user's image or we see the anonymous
384:30 - image and then we have a button okay so
384:34 - if I hit start a post I see
384:37 - this cool start a
384:40 - post okay and then it uh when I click
384:44 - that start a post button this thing is
384:45 - treated like a
384:47 - button and uh when I click it the handle
384:49 - click uh function runs
384:53 - okay so that little thing we added there
384:56 - is helpful and awesome and now on this
384:59 - button what we're going to do is we're
385:00 - just going to add in what happens when
385:03 - it is uh disabled okay so we're going to
385:06 - do props out
385:09 - loading okay and if so loading is either
385:12 - true otherwise it's false okay so if
385:15 - it's loading set the disabled to True
385:18 - otherwise set it to
385:20 - false so like we shouldn't be able to
385:22 - click that thing or do anything to it if
385:26 - it's a
385:30 - loading cool let's go to where our cont
385:34 - content component
385:37 - is so let's find
385:40 - content um actually we don't have
385:42 - content component yet so let's go ahead
385:44 - and add it and where I want to add it is
385:49 - let's go to our share boox right there
385:53 - okay and right underneath my share boox
385:56 - I'm going to add this cool so let's do
386:00 - this and I'm going to do props loading
386:04 - so if my loading is going on
386:07 - then show my loading
386:10 - spinner
386:14 - imagespin loader.
386:18 - SVG okay and I think we should be good
386:22 - even with
386:25 - that and let's end that
386:28 - image that should be
386:31 - good okay so our content
386:36 - um our content component is actually
386:38 - going to be just a tad bit
386:43 - longer so let's go ahead and remove this
386:47 - div that we're wrapping article in and
386:51 - instead we're going to wrap article
386:53 - inside of content okay so I'm going to
386:56 - remove the um let's go ahead and remove
387:00 - that div and let's grab the ending of
387:04 - the
387:04 - content and let's go all the way down to
387:07 - where article
387:10 - ends and let's remove this div as well
387:13 - and paste content okay so instead of
387:15 - wrapp wrapping our article in a div
387:18 - we're going to wrap article in our
387:20 - content component now again it's going
387:22 - to complain it's going to be like hey
387:24 - you haven't defined
387:26 - content okay no problem we're Pros now
387:29 - so we're going to go ahead and Define
387:31 - content going to do style div
387:36 - okay let's go up boom in there and I'm
387:40 - going to do text
387:41 - align Center just like
387:45 - this okay and um let me go
387:51 - ahead
387:54 - cool okay let's do again this is for the
387:58 - loading part okay I'm going to do
388:01 - image with 30 pixels
388:06 - all right and then let's
388:09 - go to the end
388:11 - here all right and
388:14 - um we're now going to
388:17 - Define what happens to our map State
388:20 - props so map state to
388:27 - props and we'll do
388:30 - return loading State article state.
388:35 - loading and uh we'll also do what's
388:38 - going on with the user so we'll get
388:40 - access to the user
388:42 - State and then let's do map
388:46 - dispatch to
388:48 - props okay and we'll just leave that
388:51 - blank for
388:58 - now like this
389:05 - leave it
389:09 - blank cool and let's do export default
389:13 - and we'll do
389:16 - connect map dispatch to props as well
389:19 - and of course
389:21 - main that's this file that we're in now
389:24 - it's like hey I don't know what connect
389:25 - is okay don't worry it's not Connect 4
389:29 - but it's importing connect from
389:32 - react read du like
389:35 - so and that should know what we're
389:38 - trying to do so let's try to add an
389:41 - image and see what happens
389:45 - now we did not get a
389:52 - spinner okay that was not
389:55 - fun we definitely expected a spinner and
389:59 - then we got like Rick Rolled
390:12 - oh actually first of all let's go to
390:14 - this part here we I don't need these
390:18 - uh squigglies here first of all for the
390:21 - loading so let's remove that and uh
390:25 - let's try refreshing
390:28 - now and giving it a good old College try
390:32 - seeing if the spinner shows up
390:36 - nope okay and let's actually try putting
390:39 - a period here real quick and do period
390:42 - SL imagespin loader. SVG let's see if
390:46 - that helps us out
390:51 - here
390:53 - nope okay I'm officially an idiot so I
390:56 - was like wait what the freak is going on
390:58 - with the loading bar so loading bar is
391:01 - completely working I just forgot that it
391:04 - Works um not to show the image because
391:07 - the image pretty much just loads
391:10 - instantaneously but this bar is actually
391:13 - useful for when I hit post now the
391:15 - loading bar shows so perfect okay
391:20 - everything is working as expected and uh
391:23 - we're making great progress this was
391:25 - really awesome and fun so far so it
391:27 - wasn't because I put a little period in
391:30 - front of my
391:32 - um uh
391:34 - whatever that thing was uh the spinner
391:36 - the spinner logo okay so anyways good
391:40 - progress let's keep going now what we're
391:42 - going to do is when the page is loading
391:44 - we're going to call the API using use
391:46 - effect and we're going to use that to
391:48 - get actually the Articles from Firebase
391:51 - okay so we're going to use react hooks
391:53 - to get um articles from Firebase so
391:56 - let's go ahead and do that so I'm going
391:58 - to go into my index which is index.js
392:01 - inside of my actions okay
392:04 - okay and uh let's go ahead and add a
392:08 - completely new function in here so I'm
392:11 - going to do export function and do get
392:15 - articles
392:17 - articles API okay and then we're going
392:21 - to say
392:23 - return dispatch like
392:27 - so and we're going to say let payload
392:31 - okay so let's just leave payload as is
392:34 - and I'm going to say db. collection I'll
392:37 - do articles and now we're going to get
392:40 - data from the Articles okay so we're
392:42 - going to do order
392:44 - by we're going to do
392:47 - actor. dat cool and we're going to do
392:51 - descending like
392:53 - so and uh then I'm going to do on
393:00 - Snapshot okay this allows me to read
393:03 - data from from my
393:05 - Firebase I'm going to say payload is
393:08 - equal to
393:09 - snapshot. docs.
393:11 - map and um all the documents that I
393:15 - pretty much get back I'm essentially
393:17 - going to just kind of put them in an
393:19 - array okay map them that's what map will
393:23 - output that's what payload will become
393:25 - and I'll console the log payload as well
393:27 - so you can kind of see it
393:30 - okay cool now I have to refer to this
393:33 - and use this inside of my main JS okay
393:36 - so let's go to main let's go import I'm
393:40 - going to import use effect so I can use
393:44 - it and I'm going to bring uh use State
393:48 - because I will also need State need to
393:51 - also manage State cool let's do import
393:56 - the get articles function as well that
393:59 - we made inside of our
394:01 - actions okay we're going to do
394:03 - [Music]
394:05 - actions dot dot SL actions just like
394:08 - that
394:11 - great and uh let's go ahead and just add
394:14 - that uh right here say use
394:20 - effect
394:23 - cool and props doget
394:28 - articles okay so this will just pretty
394:31 - much run it once
394:34 - articles like this so essentially when I
394:38 - go to main page uh we're going to try to
394:40 - run this
394:43 - once let's go down all the way and now
394:48 - we're going to do our Redux stuff so
394:50 - let's go to
394:51 - dispatch state to
394:54 - props I'm going to go inside of here
394:56 - let's do get
394:58 - articles and
395:01 - um ENT going to say dispat get articles
395:05 - API like so and run it run it run it run
395:10 - it
395:15 - okay okay let's see do I have an error
395:21 - here use effect and use State what is it
395:25 - complaining
395:28 - about um oh I have uh I have it twice so
395:31 - that can just be on one line that's fine
395:34 - refresh cannot read property collection
395:37 - of
395:39 - undefined okay great so let's hit
395:42 - inspect and see if uh we're console
395:44 - logging anything we got an array of four
395:48 - and uh this is perfect because as you
395:50 - can
395:52 - see this array of four is telling
395:56 - me what do I have okay so I have four
396:01 - items okay one is um this image right
396:06 - here the user
396:08 - image one is this image right
396:11 - here okay let me copy that string and
396:15 - paste
396:15 - it that image right there cool here's
396:20 - another one it has a link to that
396:24 - video and then here's another
396:28 - one okay so shared image let's see where
396:32 - that takes me
396:34 - permission
396:35 - denied okay all
396:38 - good but it's looking like I have access
396:41 - to all of this and I can actually read
396:45 - it okay now what we're going to do is
396:48 - we're going to dispatch an action to the
396:51 - store um and uh for for setting articles
396:55 - okay this will allow us to set articles
396:57 - and then later we'll be able to do a lot
396:59 - more things with
397:00 - them all right cool so let's go ahead
397:03 - head and do that so I'm going to go
397:05 - inside of my action type and let's have
397:07 - another action type export const get
397:11 - articles and uh surprise surprise is
397:14 - going to be called get
397:16 - articles
397:23 - cool now let's go inside of my
397:26 - main and inside of my main where I'm
397:29 - defining
397:30 - my mapping state to props let's add
397:34 - articles in here as well and I'm going
397:36 - to say state. article
397:39 - state. articles like this
397:44 - cool and uh let's go inside of
397:49 - my article reducer okay if we don't have
397:53 - one do we need to create one no we have
397:55 - article reducer great okay let's go to
397:58 - our initial State and um we're going to
398:01 - do a few things actually all the way at
398:02 - the top so we're going to import set
398:04 - loading status we're also going to
398:06 - import get
398:10 - articles okay underneath here I'm going
398:13 - to say
398:14 - articles and
398:18 - uh whoops like this let's make articles
398:21 - an empty array in the
398:24 - start all right initial and now in our
398:28 - switch
398:29 - cases we're going to say hey if there's
398:32 - a case of get
398:35 - articles then what we need to do is
398:38 - return the existing
398:40 - state along
398:43 - with whatever the article's payload
398:52 - is just like
398:54 - so
398:58 - cool and now let's go to index inside of
399:02 - our actions
399:06 - all right and in our index we are going
399:09 - to import we have set user we have set
399:12 - loading
399:13 - status now let's go ahead and add get
399:16 - articles and I import
399:19 - this
399:21 - and let's go here and I'm going to do
399:24 - export cons get
399:28 - articles payload
399:33 - type get articles like that payload will
399:38 - be
399:41 - payload okay and let's go all the way
399:43 - down where I'm like sorting it by actor
399:47 - date and descending order all I'm going
399:50 - to do instead of this console log we're
399:53 - going to dispatch this I'm going to say
399:55 - get
399:56 - articles
399:58 - payload okay and I don't need this line
400:01 - anymore so let's hit save save on this
400:04 - thing so we're done okay this is
400:07 - allowing us
400:09 - to set the
400:12 - Articles okay cool
400:16 - test I'm going to just add a dummy image
400:20 - not too much be happening right
400:22 - now cool okay so everything is
400:26 - working now what I want to do is I want
400:29 - to hide the main content until there are
400:32 - artic
400:34 - so we don't want to show any of the
400:36 - content unless we have like articles in
400:38 - there okay so like for example I don't
400:41 - have any articles then like kind of
400:43 - don't show any of this the
400:47 - content cool so let's we're um inside of
400:52 - our main
400:54 - JS let's go all the way
400:58 - up let's go up right above the container
401:03 - okay and right above the container I'm
401:06 - going to open up a jsx
401:09 - fragment and uh right underneath where
401:12 - does the container
401:14 - end so let's see where our container
401:17 - ends under what where our container ends
401:19 - I'm going to close off my jsx fragment
401:25 - okay and here's another thing I'm going
401:27 - to do I'm going to open up a squiggly
401:29 - all the way at the top right here okay
401:34 - and uh we're going to close it all the
401:37 - way at the bottom right before the jsx
401:40 - fragment ending and hit save
401:43 - okay now why we're doing this is so we
401:46 - can add our Turner operator so I'm going
401:48 - to say if article's length is zero
401:51 - meaning there's no articles then what I
401:54 - want you to do is basically say
401:59 - there what the hell just happened
402:03 - there we go there are no articles like
402:07 - that okay that's all I want you to say
402:12 - or give me all of the things okay give
402:16 - me the share boox give me
402:22 - everything cool so this is a pretty
402:25 - simple turny operator but it's also
402:27 - pretty badass cuz it's
402:30 - like wait where did my endings squiggly
402:32 - go
402:33 - it's also pretty badass it basically
402:35 - says if there's zero then just show this
402:38 - there are no articles and if there are
402:40 - articles then do
402:43 - all of this okay kind of
402:51 - crazy
402:55 - cool okay beautiful now we're going to
402:59 - add the
403:00 - loader uh component
403:08 - all right so a few things need to happen
403:10 - so let's go and make the loader
403:15 - component all
403:28 - right actually you know what let's
403:31 - actually skip the loader component
403:33 - because I think it's going to add a ton
403:34 - of additional code and not that much
403:37 - functionality so let's pass on that
403:39 - honestly and instead what I want to do
403:42 - is uh let's display the articles that we
403:45 - actually get back from
403:47 - Firebase okay I think that's going to be
403:50 - a lot more uh interesting to
403:53 - add cool so to get started on this we're
403:57 - just going to do a few things inside of
404:00 - our main JS so let's go main Js yes cool
404:04 - I'm
404:05 - there um let's go down to where I'm
404:10 - loading my
404:16 - spinner down down down down okay so
404:19 - here's where my spinner is
404:23 - happening okay now right underneath this
404:27 - I'm going to do a couple of things here
404:38 - okay so buckle up cuz a lot is going to
404:43 - be happening here so hang in there with
404:47 - me let's go props do
404:52 - articles.
404:55 - length all right if it's greater than
404:57 - zero then I want the following to
405:01 - happen I want to map those
405:06 - articles okay and I'm going to need the
405:09 - key uh for performance
405:16 - sake so I'm going to say hey
405:19 - article key is equal to key like
405:30 - so okay and there's a a lot of stuff
405:33 - that we're going to be deleting soon as
405:35 - well um and it's going to make a ton of
405:38 - sense shortly
405:41 - okay so let's go articles. map
405:47 - key okay let's put
405:50 - a bracket
405:56 - there okay and uh we're going to need to
406:00 - end that article at some point
406:04 - but not to
406:06 - worry let's actually do this okay so I'm
406:10 - going to
406:12 - remove all of this here so we're just
406:15 - opening this
406:17 - okay and I'm just going to use this
406:20 - article right here and let's give it a
406:25 - key cool cuz like initially I was just
406:27 - like showing one post but we're going to
406:29 - need to show multiple posts okay
406:36 - so this whole thing is going to end up
406:38 - getting wrapped up okay so we're going
406:42 - to have to go all the way down and wrap
406:44 - up this whole
406:46 - thing so let's go all the way outside of
406:52 - article let's go ahead
406:56 - and close
406:58 - it okay so hopefully the error should
407:01 - stop just for a little bit
407:04 - okay now we're going to make our changes
407:07 - that we wanted to make okay so inside of
407:09 - our a um we're not just going to have
407:12 - this hardcoded image of the user we're
407:14 - going to have the image of the
407:17 - actual uh user okay so let's do
407:21 - article.
407:23 - actor.
407:28 - image okay so see now
407:33 - it's cool because it has my image right
407:36 - there that's what we wanted it's pulling
407:39 - that straight from Firebase that's a
407:41 - really really good
407:44 - sign so that's done the next thing is
407:48 - where it says
407:49 - title we're going to dynamically get
407:52 - this as well so I'm going to
407:56 - say article. actor. tile like
408:01 - so okay so now notice that my name is
408:04 - coming
408:06 - through that's also really
408:09 - good let's do the same thing here
408:12 - article.
408:17 - actor.
408:23 - description okay and now my email is
408:26 - showing
408:28 - up and then I'm going to do
408:31 - article. actor
408:34 - dat and we're going to make it uh if I
408:36 - leave it here let's see what it does oh
408:38 - ho
408:39 - ho very
408:44 - interesting let's see if it bugs
408:49 - out it freaks
408:52 - out okay and that's because we're
408:55 - getting a weird date from Firebase so
408:57 - we're going to do2 date like that and
409:01 - let's see if that fixes it it
409:10 - refresh okay and if that doesn't fix it
409:13 - then we're going to do that to
409:16 - loal
409:18 - date
409:21 - string okay hopefully that should fix it
409:26 - and it does okay all we have to do was
409:29 - change it and indeed it is April 24th
409:32 - here Saturday 1:17 a.m. so I'm grinding
409:37 - out here 1:17 a.m. for your beautiful
409:40 - face so if you're happy about that and
409:42 - you want to show your appreciation smash
409:45 - that like button subscribe to the
409:47 - Channel all right that's what I got for
409:50 - you so that to me looks
409:54 - good outside of this let's see what do
409:57 - we need to change where it says
409:58 - description let's change you know the
410:01 - description is hard coded so let's
410:04 - change that with
410:06 - article.
410:08 - description like
410:11 - so okay so test that's actually what I
410:15 - wrote test test test test
410:17 - test okay let's see what happens if I
410:20 - write hello and hit
410:22 - post okay so right now those things are
410:26 - not actually being added uh to the
410:28 - databases and coming back we're not able
410:30 - to read back from it so no worries okay
410:32 - because it's still also sometimes
410:34 - waiting for an image so a couple of
410:35 - things are happening and while it's
410:37 - loading did you notice I couldn't make a
410:38 - new post so that was cool because it
410:41 - disables uh the start a post
410:44 - button so that's really cool
410:46 - functionality underneath shared image
410:50 - we're going to do we're going to do a
410:53 - couple of
410:55 - things okay inside of shared
410:59 - image should we leave this hardcoded
411:02 - image
411:04 - probably probably not probably not so
411:09 - we're going to get rid of
411:13 - it okay why well because it's hardcoded
411:17 - we don't want it to be hardcoded we want
411:19 - to work on it and change things
411:21 - dynamically okay so here we go so I'm
411:24 - going to say if article shared image is
411:27 - not there and article. video
411:34 - is there then what I want you to do is
411:38 - uh use the react
411:40 - player all right so we're going to do
411:43 - react
411:45 - player and I'm going to give it a width
411:49 - of
411:51 - 100% like
411:55 - that okay and URL is going to be
412:00 - article. video like this
412:03 - and let's close
412:07 - it
412:10 - cool all right so let's also import the
412:14 - react player okay so let's go all the
412:16 - way to the top I'm going to do import
412:19 - react player from
412:22 - react
412:27 - player okay dope
412:36 - cool and uh now we'll add our or
412:40 - statement and we're going to say
412:43 - or do the following okay article. shared
412:48 - image if that's
412:50 - there then do this
412:55 - image article.
412:57 - shared
413:00 - image and then just C close it
413:06 - off okay
413:09 - so open
413:14 - close
413:19 - um what's the problem here did I add a
413:23 - question mark question
413:31 - mark oh my my bad this should not be
413:37 - here yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
413:42 - yeah because that's going to end that
413:45 - whole
413:46 - thing
413:48 - okay wow that looks great look at that
413:55 - wow yeah buddy okay so I like it I like
414:01 - it a lot
414:03 - okay hover over this
414:06 - beautiful
414:08 - beautiful that's absolutely absolutely
414:12 - great all right now let's do articles
414:16 - comments
414:21 - okay so let's go
414:23 - down
414:25 - downtown right underneath so let's find
414:28 - our social so we have our social
414:30 - accounts ending uh here
414:33 - and let's go a little bit above
414:36 - that I have comments and my comments are
414:39 - hardcoded in here I don't want it to be
414:42 - hardcoded so we're going to make them
414:44 - Dynamic and I'm going to do article.
414:51 - comments all right
414:54 - zero it's almost kind of like hardcoded
414:58 - but you know not really so that's good
415:04 - okay great so this is looking good now
415:07 - this is a lot of code a lot a lot just
415:11 - this line is almost 400 lines of code or
415:15 - this file I mean so great we have all of
415:18 - this showing up exactly like how we want
415:20 - it that makes me really
415:23 - happy and then of course let's do should
415:28 - we add more text no I I don't think I'm
415:30 - going to add this more text
415:31 - functionality
415:34 - okay uh let's try now adding another
415:37 - post and let's see if it actually
415:41 - reads hey there um we just got done
415:48 - building LinkedIn
415:52 - clone with fire uh with
415:55 - reactjs
415:57 - Firebase and
416:01 - Redux for
416:04 - image I don't know let me go and pick a
416:07 - cool image so I'm going to go inside of
416:12 - thumbnails and uh sure let's just pick
416:18 - uh just pick one of
416:23 - these let's just pick this why not why
416:26 - not let's hit post
416:32 - look at that we just got done building
416:35 - our LinkedIn clone with react GS
416:37 - Firebase and
416:39 - Redux so now our post functionality is
416:43 - completely working exactly the way we
416:46 - want it to that is absolutely gorgeous
416:50 - all right and before we deploy this
416:53 - thing cuz we're so freaking close and
416:56 - I'm so proud of you that you've done
416:57 - such a good job we just need to fix one
417:00 - thing this over here looks funny and
417:02 - these like buttons and these things look
417:04 - funny so this is going to
417:06 - be uh pretty simple so let's go inside
417:09 - of our main JS and first let's fix
417:11 - social count so social count component
417:14 - is that one right there this one right
417:16 - here okay so inside of our button let's
417:19 - try going border none so let's take away
417:23 - the border and uh let's also do
417:25 - background color
417:27 - white okay so it just just matches the
417:30 - the rest of the background
417:33 - okay great so that looks good to me
417:36 - let's also go inside of social actions
417:37 - and we're going to do something similar
417:39 - inside of our button let's go um let's
417:43 - go border
417:45 - none okay great and let's go background
417:50 - color
417:53 - white okay beautiful so now there you go
418:00 - that is our LinkedIn clone it is looking
418:03 - absolutely gorgeous you can log in you
418:06 - can log out I mean every single
418:08 - functionality is there we're using Redux
418:11 - we have our drop- down menus working I
418:13 - mean this is beautiful like think about
418:15 - it right like if I go mobile
418:18 - mode right look at how good the mobile
418:21 - version looks just absolutely freaking
418:26 - beautiful okay so this is an amazing
418:29 - clone you've done a great job so far and
418:32 - now for the last piece of the puzzle all
418:34 - we're going to do is we're going to
418:36 - deploy it together okay so sometimes
418:40 - um I forget my deploying commands but
418:43 - let's just go ahead and figure it out um
418:47 - you know in this video so first things
418:49 - first what one thing I know that I need
418:52 - to do is I'm going to need to run npm
418:55 - run build and I'm also going to need to
418:57 - set up Firebase hosting okay so we're
419:00 - going to go ahead through that process
419:01 - now
419:02 - now um let's try let's try
419:07 - um npm run
419:12 - build okay and let's see it go through
419:15 - the
419:18 - build okay and then we're going to do
419:21 - Firebase deploy and let's see what
419:23 - happens and when we run into errors
419:24 - we'll try to solve them together okay
419:26 - not to worry just make sure you're
419:28 - inside of um the main folder like
419:31 - LinkedIn clone okay main directory now
419:33 - we should have a build folder and this
419:35 - is going to be all our optimized images
419:38 - and files that are going to be ready are
419:41 - are going to be essentially production
419:44 - ready okay so there we go that's good
419:48 - our build is good to go and now I'm
419:51 - going to try doing
419:54 - Firebase
419:56 - deploy so I'm imagining I'm going to get
419:59 - some kind of error or some kind of
420:01 - process
420:02 - okay cool no worries let's see do I have
420:05 - any Firebase commands that I've
420:10 - written uhhuh so I remember the command
420:13 - is actually Firebase in nit that's what
420:15 - I was looking for okay so we're just
420:16 - going to initialize it let's go here and
420:19 - select hosting because we're going to
420:22 - need to host it um so that's good let's
420:27 - go use an existing project and let's go
420:30 - to is LinkedIn
420:38 - clone is it actually logged into the
420:41 - right one because I'm not seeing my
420:47 - project okay I'm going to end out of it
420:49 - let's do Firebase in it one more time
420:51 - and let's go
420:53 - hosting okay and uh let's create a new
420:56 - project because that that pro project
420:59 - just might not have been there
421:08 - okay let's call it
421:11 - LinkedIn
421:13 - clone what would you like to call your
421:16 - project LinkedIn
421:19 - clone I did not mean to specify an
421:25 - ID there's already a project with
421:27 - LinkedIn clone okay all good so let's
421:29 - actually go to Firebase from
421:33 - here okay let's go to project
421:37 - overview project
421:43 - settings okay link to a Firebase hosting
421:45 - site let's see if we can do that
421:53 - boom okay and let's go through the init
421:56 - project uh init process one more time
422:00 - let's do hosting
422:02 - hit
422:04 - enter um I don't think it's going to let
422:07 - me select an existing
422:10 - project why is it not seeing any of the
422:12 - LinkedIn though that's what I'm curious
422:16 - about
422:22 - because it sees all this other
422:27 - stuff but it not does not see any of the
422:30 - LinkedIn which which is very interesting
422:33 - to
422:35 - me so one thing you can do is make sure
422:39 - so it's because I'm logged into the
422:42 - wrong Firebase so I'm going to see if I
422:43 - can log out and I'm going to log into
422:46 - the right Firebase okay that's really
422:48 - where my problems were coming
422:52 - from
422:54 - cool so you can do this too if you're
422:56 - not logged into Firebase make sure you
422:58 - log into Firebase if you haven't
423:00 - installed Firebase make sure you install
423:02 - Firebase now would be a good
423:06 - time now I'm logged in to Firebase okay
423:10 - so good now let's do Firebase inet now I
423:14 - should see my dummy LinkedIn clone use
423:18 - an existing
423:20 - project the dummy LinkedIn clone that we
423:23 - worked on our directory is going to be
423:27 - build I'm going to hit enter
423:32 - configure as a single page app I'm going
423:34 - to say yes setup automatic
423:38 - bills file build already exists you want
423:40 - to overwrite just hit
423:43 - enter okay so now we' have gone through
423:45 - the initialization process I've also
423:47 - done npm run build so I have my build
423:50 - folder let's try Firebase
