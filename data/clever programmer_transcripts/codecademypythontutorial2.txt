00:00 - hey guys how are you doing last time we
00:02 - stopped at 10% so let's continue from
00:07 - here so that we were going through the
00:08 - Python course and I want to do this
00:12 - challenge and just try to finish
00:14 - Codecademy as fast as I can while trying
00:17 - to explain what's going on here okay so
00:20 - now we're doing explicit string
00:23 - conversion so I have a plus coconut so
00:27 - this would basically write out I have
00:29 - two coconuts okay so if I took this and
00:34 - like I was showing you guys whoops
00:36 - that's not what I meant to do if I
00:39 - opened up my terminal here let's make
00:42 - the screen a lot bigger so you guys can
00:44 - see clearly and let's open up I'm trying
00:52 - to open a Python too
00:54 - and if I do Python here and I tried this
00:59 - line you see I get I have two coconuts
01:02 - okay another website I want to show you
01:05 - guys that's really great that you can
01:07 - use to use a terminal just in case
01:09 - you're having some problems or you're
01:11 - using Windows to follow along you can
01:13 - use this website called repple it ok and
01:17 - in this website you can pretty much
01:19 - choose what language you want to use so
01:21 - here let's say you want to use Python 3
01:25 - so you can write the same thing down
01:27 - except in Python 3 print as a function
01:30 - so you have to put parentheses around it
01:32 - and let me make this one bigger as well
01:36 - so you guys can see it clearly and I'm
01:40 - going to hit run and you see it says I
01:42 - have 2 coconuts so this is like an
01:44 - interactive IDE or tournament this is an
01:46 - interactive terminal that you guys can
01:48 - use so I would highly suggest to use
01:50 - repple dot it for for you're using your
01:54 - terminal if you don't know how to use
01:56 - one on your computer ok so this is a
02:00 - situation we have here okay and they're
02:04 - showing us what this is going to do here
02:06 - so let's see the run the code as is and
02:08 - it says you're going to get an error
02:10 - and now what does the air it says it
02:13 - says cannot concatenate string and float
02:15 - objects so you can't combine the value
02:19 - of pi is around so this is a string and
02:21 - a float number float number is a number
02:24 - with decimal values so it says you can't
02:26 - can concatenate these two so we need to
02:30 - turn both of these into a string so how
02:32 - are we going to do that well we're going
02:34 - to wrap through 3.14 in a string and
02:37 - that's going to take care of it for us
02:39 - the value of pi is around 3.14 okay so
02:43 - let's continue going alright string one
02:47 - came lot camelot string two is place
02:51 - let's not go two percent s two so silly
02:55 - percent s all this does is called a
02:58 - placeholder so we wrote this string here
03:02 - okay we write this string here and
03:04 - percent s is going to basically act like
03:07 - variables okay so the first percent s is
03:10 - going to match with this string one here
03:13 - and the second percent s is going to
03:15 - match with string two here so this is
03:18 - going to say let's not go to Camelot or
03:22 - a came lot and then it's going to say
03:24 - this is silly and then string two is
03:27 - going to get inside of here so place so
03:31 - that's what that's going to say let's
03:33 - not go to Camelot is a silly place those
03:37 - are just you know you're in string
03:39 - formatting those are your placeholders
03:41 - so you can put anything that you want
03:44 - for them okay all right string
03:50 - formatting percent to raw input what
03:53 - this does is it takes in data from the
03:56 - user and assigns it to a variable so for
03:58 - example let me open up here let me show
04:02 - you here maybe it let's run it um okay
04:09 - so let's let's open up my terminal
04:11 - because this is not Python too so there
04:14 - are some things that it does at our
04:16 - Python 3 specific let's try it here
04:20 - so name takes in as raw input so it's
04:23 - basically taking in the user input so
04:26 - it's going to let me type in the name
04:27 - and whatever I type in it's going to
04:30 - make name equal to that value so let's
04:33 - say my name is Rafa or Kazi whatever you
04:37 - want to type in let's hit enter now
04:39 - let's type name and you can see name is
04:42 - Kazi all right and generally when you
04:47 - write stuff like this you want to put a
04:48 - little space here so it looks nicer so
04:51 - when it asks you what is your name it
04:52 - puts a little space there so you can you
04:57 - can write whatever you want okay now if
04:59 - I type name you can see it's clever
05:00 - programmer so that's what ronpa does
05:04 - cause same thing you'll ask you for a
05:07 - request with then the message is going
05:09 - to say what is your quest and then you
05:11 - get to type in the value that you want
05:14 - okay so basically if I don't put any
05:18 - message here and make it empty it's
05:22 - letting me tight but it's not telling me
05:24 - what I should be typing so it's nice and
05:27 - more user friendly when you actually
05:28 - have a message like what is your name
05:30 - there here I don't know how to type if I
05:33 - wrote 4 3 4 3 4 and didn't name well I
05:37 - didn't know I was trying to put in a
05:39 - name I thought maybe I was trying to put
05:40 - an ID number because it didn't ask me so
05:43 - I just assumed so you don't want your
05:46 - the people that you write a program for
05:49 - you don't want them to assume you want
05:50 - to clearly give them instructions what
05:52 - they should type in okay so quest it's
05:56 - going to take in some input from you
05:57 - color is going to take in some input
05:59 - from you as well and then it's going to
06:01 - say so your name is blank your quest is
06:04 - blank and your color is blank don't
06:06 - remember the placeholders and we're just
06:08 - going to replace this with placeholders
06:10 - so % s this name is going to get into
06:13 - this percent s here I'm going to do % us
06:17 - and % s so it's going to take in name
06:21 - quest and color by having us type it and
06:25 - then it's going to put all of that in
06:28 - these % s s the last thing we have to
06:31 - fix as this needs to also turn it
06:33 - actually this is just going to be a % so
06:37 - this is just some syntax stuff now let
06:40 - me run it what is your name Kazi what is
06:44 - your quest walkthrough of code Academy
06:52 - and what is your favorite color ma blue
06:56 - ah so your name is kasi your quest is
07:01 - walkthrough of code Academy and your
07:03 - favorite color is blue so this is a very
07:06 - nice way of printing out stuff it's
07:08 - really cool okay
07:11 - next so now this time for review now for
07:14 - something completely familiar good job
07:16 - you've learned a lot in this unit
07:17 - including three ways to create strings
07:19 - okay we learned string methods so you
07:23 - can create a string by putting single
07:26 - quotes you can create a string by
07:28 - creating a double quotes around the word
07:30 - and you can create a string by putting
07:33 - string and not having to put the quotes
07:35 - around it okay now you learn string
07:39 - methods if you have a string and you
07:40 - call the method dot upper on it
07:42 - everything turns into upper if you have
07:45 - echo like this let me make it more
07:48 - interactive for you guys echo lower and
07:51 - if I try Delta upper you can see that it
07:55 - made Delta an uppercase a length of
07:58 - Charlie what do you think that's going
07:59 - to give you so take a second to think
08:01 - about it it's going to give you one two
08:05 - three four five six seven so the number
08:09 - of characters as in Charlie printing a
08:12 - string print Foxtrot it simply just
08:15 - prints out your string okay advanced
08:20 - printing technique so golf hotel and
08:23 - then we use this string formatting here
08:25 - so these little place holders like
08:27 - percent s and then it takes the value of
08:29 - jean this percentage takes the value of
08:31 - H okay let's try to run that to see golf
08:36 - comma hotel that's what I got so let's
08:40 - wrap it all up on line three create the
08:43 - variable my
08:45 - string and set it to any string you like
08:48 - hello programmers and print online for
08:54 - print the length of my string so how are
08:56 - we going to do that we're going to do
08:58 - print Len of my string and on line five
09:08 - we're going to say we're going to print
09:13 - my string in uppercase okay so that's
09:20 - how we're going to do that okay so we
09:24 - created a string hello programmers we
09:26 - printed out the length of my string
09:29 - which is 18 characters and then we
09:31 - printed out the actual string but we
09:33 - make sure we made sure we upper-caste
09:34 - everything so this is nice because you
09:37 - don't have to write caps lock you don't
09:38 - have to use caps lock here okay
09:42 - date and time let's start the lesson so
09:46 - oh cool so date and date time import
09:53 - date time why is it asking me about date
09:55 - time because that's a little bit more
09:58 - advanced but sure a lot of times you
10:00 - want to keep track of when something
10:02 - happened we can also do this using date
10:04 - time in Python here we'll use day time
10:06 - to print the date and time in a nice
10:07 - format okay cool getting the current
10:13 - time create a variable call okay so if
10:15 - we do print date time now so let me show
10:18 - you this let's actually make the smaller
10:26 - because you don't need to have it that
10:29 - big and make this picture okay and let
10:36 - me actually okay that's fine so I went
10:41 - ahead and I did from date time import
10:43 - date time and now I'm going to go ahead
10:46 - and print date time now so it's showing
10:50 - you today's date in today's time
10:54 - okay so you can do cool things you can
10:56 - say daytime past is equal to daytime now
11:01 - and what you can do now is you can do if
11:05 - you want to see the difference of the
11:07 - current time and when you start it you
11:10 - can do something like this okay since I
11:14 - stored past and previously so it's going
11:17 - to just have that value here so this is
11:21 - basically year's month and then the date
11:24 - and then you know the hours and minutes
11:27 - and seconds and then seconds from 1970
11:31 - so now I'm going to do past or daytime
11:39 - not now - past so this tells me it's
11:43 - been 40 seconds okay and the difference
11:48 - is 0 hours 0 minutes and 40 seconds ok
11:54 - cool now let's let's go on to the actual
12:00 - assignment okay daytime dot now and then
12:11 - print the value of now so let's do that
12:13 - print now cool so it's telling me the
12:21 - time nap current time so it's saying 23
12:26 - here sudden saying something different
12:28 - than what it said on my computer but
12:30 - that's because I think this is taking
12:33 - the time some other time this is not CST
12:37 - this is not central time this is
12:39 - something else
12:40 - ok extracting information so notice how
12:46 - that put looks like this what if you
12:48 - don't want the entire date in time what
12:50 - if you want something simpler and that's
12:52 - what they're going to show you here
12:53 - so let's actually paste that here and
12:58 - let's go down here paste those two lines
13:01 - so we got now date time that now current
13:05 - year
13:07 - current months and current day and make
13:13 - it now that day so if we actually do not
13:15 - adhere look at what it shows you so this
13:18 - is now and recalling the year method on
13:22 - now now dot month okay and we've stored
13:30 - these values in these irritable so this
13:33 - will should give you the current year
13:34 - this will give you the current month and
13:39 - this will give you the current day okay
13:42 - pretty cool pretty cool you already have
13:45 - the first two lines in a third line we
13:48 - take the year and only the year from the
13:50 - variable now it's stored in the current
13:52 - year we stored the month and date from
13:54 - now now in a new line print down that
13:56 - year make sure you do it after setting
14:00 - the now a variable okay alright so let's
14:10 - print now dot year then print out now
14:15 - that month so it's pretty much the same
14:18 - way as this but we're going to just say
14:21 - month and then we have now dot date okay
14:26 - so it's going to be pretty much the same
14:28 - thing and this is going to be day and
14:33 - then that should be it okay so we got
14:36 - the actual date time object we took the
14:39 - year from it we were able to take the
14:41 - month and the day okay cool
14:45 - hot date what if we want to print a
14:48 - print today's date in the following
14:50 - format so if you wanted to make it look
14:52 - pretty okay kind of like this so string
14:56 - substitution is now going to be helpful
14:58 - so now it's going to make more sense why
14:59 - we use string substitution okay this is
15:03 - a little bit more helpful and remember
15:06 - that the percent operator fill will fill
15:09 - the percent as placeholders and string
15:11 - on the left with the strings and the
15:13 - parentheses on the right so these guys
15:16 - will get filled up by these guys so now
15:19 - that year is going to go into
15:20 - the first percent placeholder now that
15:24 - month is going to going to go into the
15:26 - second place holder and now that day
15:28 - we'll going to the third placeholder
15:31 - here okay
15:32 - and we don't want it to show up with the
15:36 - dashes here so I'm going to do this okay
15:42 - and that should work all right cool I
15:46 - can put in something else here too like
15:49 - dashes but then it's going to show
15:50 - dashes so I want to keep it I want to
15:54 - keep it like this so that's it for this
15:57 - assignment this assignment so let's move
15:59 - on pretty time nice work let's do the
16:02 - same for the hour minute and second cool
16:09 - so I'm going to pretty much take this
16:15 - line paste it down here and I'm going to
16:19 - do now that our this is going to give me
16:21 - the current hour I'm going to do now dot
16:23 - minute it's going to give me the current
16:26 - minute and I'm going to do now that
16:27 - second is going to give me the current
16:29 - second and we don't want it to show with
16:33 - slashes so we want it to look like this
16:35 - okay you can you can see that's what
16:38 - they tell you to tell you to make it do
16:41 - this is a current our current minute and
16:44 - current second so hopefully that was
16:47 - fairly simple and it's really cool
16:49 - actually I like this Thanks grand finale
16:53 - we've managed to print out the date and
16:54 - time separately in a very pretty fashion
16:57 - let's combine the two okay now let's
17:00 - combine the two so we got to make it
17:01 - look like this okay
17:03 - that's very easy what I'm going to do is
17:07 - something like
17:09 - I'm going to make the value of this
17:11 - equal to date and the value of this
17:15 - equal to time and I'm just going to say
17:17 - print date plus and let's put a little
17:22 - space in between and then time like this
17:25 - and I think that should work alright so
17:30 - this is the date I put a little space in
17:34 - the middle because otherwise it would
17:36 - all be mushed up pushed up together and
17:38 - that's not what we want we want to put a
17:39 - little space in the middle and then we
17:42 - just concatenate all of that stuff so
17:45 - the date and a little space and then the
17:48 - time okay so hopefully this makes sense
17:52 - and it wasn't too difficult alright now
17:54 - let's get started on conditionals and
17:56 - control flow this is my favorite part of
18:00 - programming this is when you can do you
18:02 - can have your program make some really
18:04 - really intelligent and really cool
18:06 - decisions and this is when I like to
18:09 - think of you're giving your program a
18:10 - brain it's able to pick and choose and
18:15 - pick the best choices and avoid the
18:17 - worst choices or the other way around
18:19 - you know kind of whatever you want it to
18:21 - do here's when you can get that true
18:24 - power over your code okay so check out
18:29 - the code in the editor let me make the
18:31 - screen I think a little bit smaller
18:33 - because we can't really see so I don't
18:40 - like how it's written because it's
18:41 - making it really confusing to read it
18:43 - this is running really long
18:46 - I wonder how if I can make the screen a
18:49 - little shorter but okay anyways so this
18:55 - is how this reads okay I have some
18:57 - function and here's what happens in
19:01 - print you've just entered the clinic and
19:03 - then it prints a second line do you take
19:05 - the door on the left or the door on the
19:07 - right and for your answer it's going to
19:12 - take in some user input okay so you get
19:15 - to type in the answer so this makes it
19:18 - more interactive
19:20 - so you get a type in the answer and it's
19:22 - going to ask you type left or right and
19:25 - then hit enter and by calling the dot
19:28 - lower method here whatever answer that
19:31 - you give it is going to take it in short
19:33 - case short case okay if your answer was
19:38 - left or your answer was L it's gonna
19:43 - make that and think that you want to go
19:45 - left okay and then it says this is a
19:49 - verbal abuse room you heap of parrot
19:52 - droppings it's kind of funny and
19:55 - effectively when you go to the loot room
19:57 - on the left
19:58 - that's the verbal abuse room and the
19:59 - room to your right that's the argument
20:01 - room so either of the rooms I really
20:05 - wouldn't want to go into but if you
20:06 - choose to go to the left now you've
20:08 - entered a verbal abuse room and it tells
20:10 - you you heap of parrot droppings and if
20:13 - you basically pick your answer and you
20:15 - chose right it's gonna say you've
20:18 - entered the argument room room and it
20:20 - says I've already told you that or I've
20:23 - told you that already
20:24 - if you haven't picked left or right as
20:28 - your answer or L or R and you pick
20:31 - something completely different it goes
20:33 - you didn't pick left or right so try
20:35 - again and then it runs the function
20:38 - again okay so it'll run this entire
20:40 - function again that's all alright
20:43 - but once you've picked something ill and
20:46 - out of it and here you're calling that
20:48 - function so basically this is the line
20:51 - if you don't have this line it's not
20:52 - going to run this entire thing okay so
20:54 - let's run through this is going to be
20:55 - pretty cool okay what do you think we
20:58 - should pick so let's pick let's pick
21:03 - let's pick something completely
21:04 - different let's just say Q okay so like
21:07 - we expected its it said you didn't pick
21:10 - left or right so try again and this time
21:13 - let's pick right of course this is the
21:16 - argument room
21:17 - I've already have told you that already
21:19 - okay if we picked left it would say this
21:22 - is the verbal abuse from you heap of
21:24 - parrot droppings so this has been you
21:26 - can really you know give your program
21:29 - some fun
21:30 - so some ideas is to take away from this
21:32 - is what if you wanted to make a game
21:34 - like rock-paper-scissors
21:37 - so if the user put in rock and the other
21:42 - user picked scissors
21:44 - well then rock wins okay or if the other
21:49 - user picked paper and the other user
21:51 - picked scissors then the user who picked
21:54 - scissors wins so now this you already
21:57 - have the power to make your first game
22:01 - all right so this is really the power of
22:04 - programming and this is one of my
22:05 - favorite things
22:07 - all right so unless you learn boolean's
22:12 - you won't be able to use if if
22:14 - statements or the control flow
22:17 - conditionals that we were learning
22:18 - earlier so let's make sure that we get
22:20 - this part and we learn it correctly so
22:23 - boo means are super important and your
22:25 - competitor operators are very very
22:27 - important so here's all your operators
22:29 - so you have equal to you have not equal
22:33 - to less than less than or equal to
22:35 - greater than or greater than equal to
22:36 - okay so let's run through them very
22:38 - quickly I'm going to open up the
22:39 - terminal here and let's go down here and
22:42 - okay let's run through them file let's
22:46 - pick two values five and let's make the
22:50 - other value of three okay so five is
22:54 - five equal to equal to three false is
22:57 - five equal equal to five true let's do
23:00 - what do you think it's going to return
23:02 - if I did five not equal to three it's
23:06 - going to return true because five is not
23:08 - equal to three here how about this what
23:12 - do you think is going to return here yep
23:14 - if you guess good chaplets false now
23:16 - let's do five is less than three five is
23:20 - less than five that's going to return
23:24 - false because five is not less than five
23:27 - let's do five is less than ten okay and
23:33 - now you can check is five less than or
23:36 - equal to ten it's five less than or
23:39 - equal to five is five less than or equal
23:42 - to four false
23:44 - let's try a day than 4 is 5 greater than
23:50 - or equal to 4 is it greater than or
23:54 - equal to 5 is it greater than or equal
23:56 - to 6
23:57 - false ok so just just to use all the
24:00 - operators and give you a sense of how
24:02 - that work
24:04 - ok so set this to true if 17 is less
24:08 - than 38 or to false if it is not so and
24:13 - 17 is less than 33 or 28 no or I'm sorry
24:18 - that's true right 17 is less set this to
24:22 - true if hundred is equal equal to 2
24:24 - times 50 so that should be true but
24:27 - let's just run it here and we get true
24:30 - and 2 times 50 is 100 so that's really
24:35 - saying 100 equal 100 right and we get
24:38 - back true so true set this to true if 19
24:44 - is less than or equal to 19 so obviously
24:47 - this is going to be true because I'm
24:49 - sorry I should write true because 19 is
24:52 - not less than 19 but is it equal it's
24:54 - equal to said this is true if negative
24:57 - 22 is greater than or equal to negative
24:59 - 18 no negative 22 is smaller than
25:04 - negative 15 so false so let's let's try
25:10 - running it in our terminal we got false
25:12 - set this to true of 99 does not equal 99
25:16 - that's false 90 plus 1 is 99 so we're
25:19 - going to get back false here let's run
25:22 - it cool all right
25:26 - assign true or false as appropriate on
25:29 - the lines below 20 minus 10 greater than
25:32 - 15 that's false 10 plus 17 and then 3 to
25:36 - the power of 16 3 to the power is again
25:38 - 16 is going to be a huge number it's
25:42 - going to be a huge number like it says
25:45 - here 43 million ok that's what that's
25:47 - going to be so is 27 equal to 43 million
25:51 - no we can also run it in our terminal
25:56 - and if you want to check what this is
25:59 - going to be you see 43 about 43 million
26:02 - okay about 43 million so this is
26:06 - absolutely false
26:08 - one squared is just one is that less
26:11 - than or equal to negative one no it's
26:13 - greater than negative 140 times four
26:16 - that 160 is that greater than or equal
26:19 - to negative 4 it's not equal to but it's
26:21 - certainly greater than so we're going to
26:23 - say true is 100 does not equal 10
26:26 - squared is remember 10 squared that's a
26:30 - hundred so a hundred is not equal to 100
26:34 - that's false okay cool all right create
26:41 - comparative statements as appropriate on
26:43 - the lines below make me true so 3 less
26:46 - than 5 it makes rule 1 true okay so if I
26:50 - just wanted to show you here bull 1
26:53 - equal to 3 is less than 5 if I print out
26:57 - blue one it's going to show you that
27:02 - it's true okay because 3 is less than 5
27:05 - right so it's not going to give you back
27:09 - 3 is less than 5 is going to evaluate
27:12 - the expression to these less than 5 and
27:14 - then store the result of that so anytime
27:16 - you use less than or greater than or
27:18 - equal equal to or not equal to or any of
27:21 - these operators you always always always
27:24 - going to get back a true or a false okay
27:28 - all right so let's make this false so
27:31 - let's say 100 is less than 1 so now
27:35 - we've made this one false let's make
27:36 - this true 100 is greater than 1 we made
27:39 - this true let's make this false again
27:42 - let's do 40 is less than 3 and let's
27:46 - make this true and so 0 is greater than
27:48 - negative 5 oh okay we have to use three
27:55 - different operators so we can see this
27:59 - and this alright so I just made it
28:05 - greater than or equal to so I'm using
28:07 - the less than operator I'm using the
28:08 - greater than or equal to operator and
28:10 - I'm using one two I'm not using three
28:24 - different operators here well I should
28:27 - be so I could be using you know let's
28:31 - just let's just do this for T does not
28:34 - equal 3
28:34 - okay how about that oh sorry let's say
28:38 - 40 we have to make it false remember
28:41 - okay all right to be and or not to be
28:45 - boolean operators so here we're going to
28:48 - learn about truth tables and things like
28:50 - true and false is false and false and
28:52 - false false and true is false so what
28:56 - they basically basically mean here is if
28:59 - I took true and false I would get back
29:02 - false okay anytime you have a anytime
29:08 - you have the end statement the only time
29:12 - you're going to get back true is when
29:16 - both of the statements are true okay so
29:18 - it's like if I asked you let's say do
29:23 - you like pizza and poison well if you
29:29 - said yes you would be saying yes to both
29:31 - things right you'd be saying yes that
29:33 - you like pizza and that you like poison
29:36 - so when I say and if I said you like
29:40 - pizza and poison you're going to say no
29:43 - even though there's only one of the
29:46 - things that you don't like by saying no
29:47 - you're turning down both things so
29:49 - whenever I have say and both of the
29:52 - statements after to be true so now let's
29:54 - say do you like pizza and ice cream and
29:56 - you might say yes okay
29:57 - or you might say true and if I ask you
30:00 - do you like ice cream and poison you're
30:04 - going to say false so anytime you have
30:06 - and both of the things have to be true
30:10 - conversely if you have or the only time
30:13 - or can
30:13 - false is if both of the statements are
30:15 - false so if I said do you like pizza or
30:18 - poison you can say true yeah
30:21 - because hey you like one of those things
30:23 - right because I said or so you can say
30:26 - you know like ice cream
30:28 - you know you chose one of them all right
30:32 - so let's let's print out what false and
30:35 - true is going to give you so think about
30:37 - it right false statement is do you like
30:39 - poison and true statement is do like ice
30:42 - cream and here what are you going to say
30:44 - you're going to say false no ok now
30:48 - let's let me give you a false and a
30:50 - false
30:50 - do you like what positive paste think I
30:55 - copied it so let me give you this
30:58 - scenario right you like poison and you
31:01 - like snakes I mean you could like snakes
31:04 - so let's just stick with that poison
31:06 - do you like poison and do you like
31:07 - poison you're gonna say false no okay
31:15 - true or true so remember the only time
31:18 - in our statement you can get back a
31:20 - false is when both of the things are
31:23 - false okay so pretty much a mostly our
31:26 - statement there's a seventy five or
31:28 - three four out of four chance you're
31:29 - going to get a statement that's true so
31:32 - true or true do you like ice cream or do
31:35 - you like pizza true okay even though you
31:40 - you're basically saying only one of them
31:42 - it applies to either one okay
31:44 - so true or false so once again you like
31:47 - pizza or do you like whatever right now
31:50 - poison so true because you like pizza so
31:54 - in our statement let's just go through a
31:57 - few more and I hope that you're getting
32:01 - a little bit of intuition of this now so
32:03 - false false is false right the only time
32:06 - you get back a false it's been both are
32:09 - false so here you have false I'm sorry
32:16 - here you have a or
32:18 - and here you have a true and I think
32:24 - they're missing something here and the
32:26 - thing that they're missing here is true
32:27 - and true is true okay that's what
32:30 - they're missing here so the only time
32:33 - true I'm sorry and the only time an ad
32:42 - statement is going to return true is
32:44 - when both of the statements are true so
32:46 - as you see here both of the statements
32:48 - are true so you get back a true every
32:50 - other case gives you false anytime in
32:53 - our statement you can get back a false
32:55 - as when both are false otherwise you get
32:57 - a true in every scenario okay not true
33:02 - as false not false is true meaning not
33:07 - is just the opposite okay so if I did
33:09 - not true I would get back the opposite
33:13 - of true which is false if I said not
33:16 - false that's up now is going to give me
33:19 - the opposite of false another way to
33:21 - think about another way to write it is
33:23 - true this exclamation mark means not so
33:27 - not true once again what is that that's
33:29 - the opposite of true and it should get
33:32 - back false
33:34 - wait what huh Oh in Python you can just
33:46 - I think you have to say not like this
33:48 - you have to but other languages not as
33:50 - like this okay what this is wait I'm
33:59 - into such huh
34:10 - what am I am i blanking out here uh Wow
34:19 - okay so for some reason I just kind of
34:22 - forgot I work with lots of different
34:23 - languages so I basically here forgot
34:27 - that uh in Python I guess you just have
34:30 - to send not cool
34:33 - doesn't matter it's very small okay so
34:39 - here and so the boolean operator and
34:45 - returns true when the expression on both
34:46 - sides of end are true so remember I
34:49 - cannot this is what I kept stressing
34:51 - earlier it both both statements have to
34:53 - be true in an end to get it true back
34:55 - okay so this makes our job real easy so
34:58 - set boo one equal to the result of false
35:00 - and false easy set result abou equal to
35:04 - this thing okay set results alright and
35:16 - okay before running it let's try to
35:18 - evaluate it okay tell me what you think
35:20 - do you like snakes and do you like
35:22 - snakes what is that going to return okay
35:25 - if you said false good job now let's
35:28 - look at this statement here okay so this
35:30 - negative negative negative they're just
35:32 - trying to confuse you negative two is
35:34 - negative two negative of that is
35:36 - positive to negative of that is negative
35:39 - two and negative of that is positive two
35:42 - so this whole thing is really just
35:43 - positive 2 okay all right so positive
35:49 - two a equal to let's see here wait did I
36:00 - do this right yeah I did this right
36:01 - right negative - positive - negative -
36:04 - positive - negative - positive -
36:06 - negative - yeah okay sorry all right
36:10 - negative is equal equal to so this thing
36:13 - it's saying is equal equal to this whole
36:16 - thing all right so now let's check that
36:19 - so four is greater than or equal to
36:23 - sixteen to the power of 0.5
36:25 - 16 to the power of 0.5 is saying the
36:28 - same thing as the square root of 16 okay
36:31 - so that's just going to give you back
36:32 - for 16 to the power square root of 16 is
36:36 - 4
36:38 - basically it's also saying for that's
36:40 - fine let's just leave it at that so here
36:43 - is 4 equal to 4 yes that's true
36:46 - but is negative 2
36:49 - how about this statement here okay let's
36:53 - check that so this is a positive 2 and
36:57 - this is a negative 2 what do you think
36:58 - this evaluates to false okay so you have
37:02 - false and true what do you think you're
37:06 - going to get if you set false good job
37:09 - because both of the statements have to
37:10 - be true all right now let's evaluate
37:14 - this guy so let's start off from from
37:19 - right here okay 19 modulo 4 does not
37:22 - equal 300 that's right 19 modulo 4 what
37:25 - is that going to give you think about it
37:27 - 4 goes perfectly into 16 but 4 does not
37:31 - go into 19 perfectly so you have a
37:33 - remainder of 3 so it's saying 3 does not
37:35 - equal 300 well that's true right 3 oh
37:41 - I'm sorry I'm reading it wrong it should
37:44 - be like this so 300 divided by 10
37:48 - divided by 10 is actually 3 so if I
37:52 - showed you guys 300 divided by 10 that's
37:55 - 30 that's divided by 10 that's 3 so here
37:58 - we're getting back 3 does not equal to 3
38:00 - that's false and we have false here so
38:05 - false and false what will that give you
38:07 - right what will that give you do you
38:11 - like when there's bubble gum stuck
38:12 - underneath the desk and do you like
38:16 - demand there's a bubble gum stuck
38:18 - underneath the desk so false no I don't
38:22 - all right
38:23 - so this whole thing is going to evaluate
38:24 - to false let's go with this guy here 1
38:30 - to the power of 2
38:31 - - that's one that's negative one and is
38:36 - that less than 2 to the power of 0
38:39 - negative 1 is less than so 2 to the
38:42 - power anything to the power of 0 is just
38:43 - 1 okay
38:45 - so negative 1 is less than 2 to the
38:49 - power of negative I'm sorry to the power
38:51 - of 0 that's 1 and 1 to the power of 2
38:54 - that's that's 1 and then we have
38:56 - negative 1 okay so is negative 1 less
39:00 - than 1 that's true and 10 modulo 10 what
39:06 - does that give us that gives us 0 is
39:09 - that less than 10 times 2 just 20 20 but
39:13 - is 20 so yeah zero and then 20 minus 20
39:17 - that's zero so this whole thing so 0 is
39:21 - less than or equal to zero and this this
39:26 - is negative 1 is less than 1 so this is
39:29 - true and this whole part is true true
39:32 - and true what does that give you gives
39:35 - you true and true and true what does
39:37 - that give you that gives you true okay
39:40 - all right so that was just some practice
39:45 - with those statements all right um okay
40:02 - so here you know if you also want to
40:05 - just try running it and see what you get
40:07 - your computer can evaluate it very
40:10 - easily and here once again you know same
40:13 - kind of things are happening but it was
40:15 - with an or statement so what does this
40:18 - part evaluate to just to be quicker
40:21 - let's do it like that so 2 ^ 3 gives you
40:25 - 8 and 108 module 100 100 goes perfectly
40:28 - into 100 and then there's 8 left over so
40:32 - this gives us back 8 and this gives us
40:35 - back 8 so this whole part of the
40:37 - equation is true and then true or but
40:41 - this cleese equal King Arthur
40:43 - now there are two different words there
40:46 - are two different names that's false so
40:48 - here we have true or false what's that
40:50 - going to evaluate to that's going to
40:52 - evaluate to true okay so let me write
40:56 - that true true or false what is that
40:59 - going to evaluate to remember the only
41:01 - time or returns of false is when you
41:04 - have both things being false okay so
41:07 - here this is true just to prove it to
41:11 - you guys let's grab this and run it cool
41:15 - ten so basically what to the power of
41:21 - two gets you tat that gets you a hundred
41:24 - square root of 100 is 10 and is 10
41:30 - greater than or equal to 50 that's false
41:32 - false or false we'll get you a false
41:35 - right that's the only time also return a
41:38 - false true or true obviously that's true
41:42 - this is false and what is this going to
41:47 - be one to the power of a hundred is just
41:50 - 100 to the power of one is a hundred
41:52 - this is a false that three factorial
41:56 - so here three times two is six we can
41:59 - ignore that so six does not equal six so
42:03 - that's false so here both of these are
42:05 - false or false and we get back a false
42:09 - okay cool so I just did that for
42:15 - practice and then now they're going to
42:17 - show us how to use the not operator here
42:20 - okay not true remember that's just
42:24 - opposite of that
42:25 - these are all just opposites so there's
42:27 - nothing hard here okay this is really
42:29 - simple I'll teach you guys how to think
42:31 - about it
42:34 - so here's how to think about it okay so
42:38 - anytime I see a knot in my head I just
42:40 - put a parentheses for everything that
42:44 - comes after it in my head so I'm going
42:48 - to just put it right here so you guys
42:50 - can see the parentheses so here's I
42:59 - think about it true so once I evaluate
43:03 - this whole thing then I just put a knot
43:04 - so I just get the opposite of that's a
43:06 - true false 3 to the power of 4 what is
43:11 - that 3 to the power of 4 that's 81 and
43:15 - what's 4 to the power of 3 that's 64 is
43:18 - 81 less than 64 No
43:22 - so that's false so this whole thing is
43:24 - false and then we just put the opposite
43:27 - of that so opposite of false is true so
43:30 - let's try running it got back true right
43:33 - true false same thing here right 10
43:40 - modulo 3 we get a remainder of 1 because
43:42 - 3 goes perfectly to 9 and then we have a
43:45 - remainder of 1 there and 10 modulo 2
43:50 - here we have remainder of 0 so we're
43:53 - saying 1 is less than or equal to 0
43:56 - that's false not false is true ok so
44:01 - this is going to give us back true let's
44:04 - try this guy here 3 squared 3 squared is
44:08 - what what is 3 squared 9 ok so you don't
44:13 - have to be good at math to be a
44:15 - programmer by the way guys you see my
44:18 - maths is not my strongest asset so 3 ^ 2
44:25 - + 4 squared it's going to be 16 + 5
44:32 - squared 25
44:32 - so here 16 does not equal to 25 that's
44:37 - no hold on I'm sorry you're going to
44:39 - first get the expression of this and
44:42 - then you're going to evaluate this guy
44:44 - separately okay so 9 plus 16 that's 25
44:48 - five and this is 25 so 25 does not equal
44:53 - 25 that's false and not false is true so
45:00 - true here - okay that's what we got true
45:05 - when I ran this computation here and not
45:09 - false so here how I would do it is like
45:12 - this okay and then put a parentheses
45:17 - around this guy so false one side value
45:21 - eight this guy that's just simple I
45:23 - pretty much you know in my head take it
45:25 - out of parentheses not false that whole
45:27 - thing turns into true and then not true
45:33 - turns into false at the end okay okay
45:41 - cool so true and then false again okay
45:51 - like that all right let's start next
45:54 - lesson this end that or this but not
45:57 - that cool
45:59 - not as evaluated first and as evaluated
46:02 - next or is evaluated last okay or is
46:04 - evaluated less and not is evaluated
46:08 - first so now let's do some let's do some
46:12 - examples so not true that gives you a
46:17 - false false and true that the whole
46:21 - thing gives you a false right let's run
46:24 - it that whole thing gives you a false
46:26 - here and then false or false or false
46:31 - will just give you a false that's the
46:34 - only time in our statement guilty on
46:36 - false let's grab it and run it you can
46:40 - see you got a false cool once okay false
46:45 - and not true or true so here we have not
46:49 - true that's false now we're going to
46:54 - evaluate the end statement okay so not
46:56 - true
46:56 - this is going to get us false false and
46:59 - false is false
47:01 - false this whole thing is false false or
47:05 - true is just it's true all right you got
47:13 - back true and at that I have a comment
47:15 - there even if I don't have it it doesn't
47:17 - matter we just tell our code to ignore
47:18 - this part so we got true ok cool let's
47:24 - go through the last few all right true
47:28 - and not ok so false or false is false
47:30 - not false oh yeah I mean it's
47:36 - parentheses so we have to evaluate it
47:38 - false or false is false not false is
47:42 - true true and true is true so we're
47:46 - going to get back true on this guy here
47:48 - so let's try running this guy true boo
47:53 - for all right not true this is false
48:02 - here so we'll keep a mental check here
48:06 - so this is false false and false as
48:10 - false so this whole thing turns into
48:12 - false and now this whole thing is false
48:18 - okay and not true is false and not false
48:21 - is true so this whole thing is true this
48:24 - whole thing is false true or false will
48:28 - return true so I hope you're getting a
48:33 - sense of how to evaluate these actually
48:38 - ok and bool 5 let's try that now true in
48:46 - true is true not true is false false or
48:49 - false is false that's the only time
48:50 - false is false okay all right cool
48:57 - and we're done let's move on okay so
49:02 - this time we'll give the expected result
49:06 - and you'll use some combination of
49:08 - boolean operators to achieve that result
49:10 - remember the boolean operators are and
49:13 - or and not so those are the boolean
49:16 - operators okay the other ones are
49:18 - comparators or comparison operators so
49:22 - less than equal to equal equal to and
49:26 - don't confuse equal equal with equal
49:28 - okay this is something I just want to
49:31 - talk about really quickly so if I did
49:33 - boolean is equal to false now if I print
49:37 - it out bool it's going to set false
49:40 - let's say your name is equal to John
49:44 - okay I don't know if you're John or not
49:45 - but let's just say that now if I did
49:48 - your name it's going to print out John
49:49 - so the one equal sign is an assignment
49:53 - operator but if I do two equal sign it's
49:56 - a logical operator okay so let's say
50:00 - I've made your name equal to cos e so
50:06 - now if you did your name and you got cos
50:11 - e and now let's check if your name is
50:13 - equal equal John so this is checking is
50:19 - this variable your name equal equal to
50:21 - John false okay so the double equal sign
50:27 - will return always return a true or
50:29 - false and the single equal sign will
50:31 - actually assign the value so single
50:33 - equal sign is an assignment operator and
50:35 - double equal sign is a comparison
50:38 - operator alright so so here they made
50:45 - some combination of boolean operators
50:48 - which is an not or or to make this a
50:52 - false okay so we are going to create
50:56 - something that's going to make this
50:58 - statement of true so I can say true and
51:00 - true I can say false or fall
51:05 - I can say true and true and I can say
51:12 - false or true right
51:16 - or how about does not not true cool so
51:24 - we did 50 exercises and we got a batch
51:26 - for it okay cool we're making good
51:29 - progress now before we move on let's see
51:34 - where we are currently so we can get a
51:36 - sense of where we headed so let's go so
51:41 - we finished Python syntax we finished
51:44 - the tip calculator we're not going to do
51:46 - this because you have to pay extra for
51:48 - this and string console date and time
51:53 - and we are currently working on
51:57 - condition conditionals and control flow
51:59 - after this we're going to do Pig Latin
52:01 - what do we have left functions lists and
52:04 - dictionaries student becomes a teacher
52:07 - more lists and functions and loops loops
52:13 - are awesome exam statistics advanced
52:16 - topics in Python and introduction to
52:18 - classes file input and output awesome so
52:22 - we have a long way to go so let's keep
52:26 - going let's keep plowing through this
