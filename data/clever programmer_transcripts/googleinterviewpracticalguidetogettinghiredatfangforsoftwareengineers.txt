04:04 - um and somebody asked is this yearly
04:07 - seller yes this is yearly salary just so
04:09 - you know
04:10 - so one thing i want to touch on is the
04:12 - fact that you know
04:13 - these companies a lot of people think
04:15 - that you need to have for example you
04:16 - need to have a degree but you don't have
04:17 - need to have a degree netflix tesla
04:19 - does not require a degree uh twitter

04:30 - in the fact that you need a degree
04:32 - that's not that is not right that is not
04:33 - true
04:34 - okay next up so let me ask you this
04:36 - question it's really simple
04:39 - do you want to get a job of thing do you
04:41 - want to get a job at big companies
04:42 - maybe you don't i don't know i'm more of
04:44 - a startup guy you know i like startups
04:46 - so i like to be in startup mode
04:48 - okay but i still want to ask you that
04:50 - question so another question you might
04:51 - be asking is like how
04:52 - how do i do this how do i do this
04:57 - well guys it's really simple all right
05:00 - it's really simple how do you think this
05:02 - is done the
05:04 - the first process that is the most
05:06 - important process is this
05:07 - process guys honestly is you just
05:10 - freaking
05:11 - apply okay i say this because to a lot
05:14 - of people come to me right
05:16 - okay a lot of people come to me and
05:17 - they're like wait nah how do i how do i
05:19 - get a job but you know google
05:21 - right and you know and i asked the
05:23 - question that hey
05:24 - did you apply even no i didn't well
05:27 - that's going to be
05:28 - your first process you need to apply
05:30 - okay
05:31 - even if you don't think that you might
05:33 - be able to to
05:35 - actually get the job maybe you don't
05:36 - have enough experience that's fine you
05:38 - can apply multiple times later on
05:40 - so you can apply now and if that doesn't
05:42 - work out you can apply later
05:43 - okay but don't be afraid that's the
05:46 - number one thing that's stopping you
05:47 - honestly
05:48 - okay so that's that's gonna be the main
05:50 - thing and
05:53 - best way but best way to apply so i know
05:56 - this is a funny one okay
05:58 - the reason why i say best way to apply
05:59 - is through here is through friends
06:02 - i thought this is a really interesting
06:03 - one it's actually because of one simple
06:06 - thing guys okay
06:08 - um the best way to get a job at any
06:11 - company
06:11 - doesn't matter okay it doesn't matter if
06:13 - it is you know i keep switching back
06:15 - because you know i'm talking a lot to
06:16 - the camera because there's a lot of it a
06:18 - lot of this is coming from my experience
06:19 - a lot of this is coming from what i know
06:21 - um the best way to apply for different
06:24 - people is
06:25 - to any company is through people you
06:27 - know because when you
06:28 - apply for people you know right you are
06:31 - a lot more likely to get that job
06:33 - my personally me guys my all of my all
06:36 - of my jobs
06:37 - came from people i know i asked around i
06:39 - asked my friend i asked this guy i asked
06:40 - this
06:41 - person and i say no i got the job
06:44 - because if you have if somebody knows
06:45 - you
06:46 - you're like 80 80 more likely to get the
06:48 - job seriously
06:50 - it is that simple so ask your friends
06:52 - ask ask
06:53 - you know ask your friends as your
06:55 - college friends whatever it might be
06:57 - you know but ask around if there's a way
06:59 - maybe maybe you want to apply for a
07:00 - company
07:01 - and there's one interesting thing that i
07:02 - will talk about later
07:04 - i'll talk about later which is how to
07:05 - actually um apply even if you do not
07:08 - have anybody
07:09 - in your friend group who works at the
07:10 - company that you want to work at right
07:12 - so
07:12 - there's a way just trust me there's a
07:14 - way okay next thing
07:16 - so big question do you need a degree
07:19 - well let me let let's see this look it
07:22 - says this is on google careers okay guys
07:23 - this is a google career said do i need a
07:25 - computer science degree to be
07:26 - a google soft engineer no a cs degree
07:29 - isn't required
07:30 - to for soft engineering or product
07:32 - management roles
07:33 - you see just that guys that gives you a
07:36 - lot of
07:37 - i mean that gives you like i know a lot
07:38 - of you guys might be watching this and
07:40 - you guys do not have a degree and that's
07:41 - okay and some of you don't that's
07:42 - that's that's cool too but if you don't
07:46 - that is still fine that is still fine
07:48 - let me make sure that emblem goes here
07:50 - okay that is still fine so so and
07:53 - actually initially enough they actually
07:54 - removed the the necessity of four
07:56 - degrees not too long ago
07:58 - cool and this is so cool elon musk said
07:59 - this really some awesome things here
08:02 - um so he talked about elon musk he
08:05 - talked about how this is you know a
08:07 - starship career day
08:08 - a starship building you know and he said
08:10 - that this is mainly for staffing up to
08:12 - four production shifts to 2047
08:14 - operations
08:14 - but engineer surprises and support
08:16 - personnel are certainly needed to
08:18 - a super hardcore work so basically he's
08:19 - talking to the
08:21 - about the fact that you simply need a
08:24 - hard
08:24 - core work ethic a talent for building
08:27 - things
08:28 - common sense and trustworthiness
08:31 - are required the rest we can train
08:35 - this is really this is really good stuff
08:37 - right here right the rest we can
08:39 - straight
08:39 - he even says here don't care if you even
08:41 - graduated high school
08:42 - like what hold on let me make sure that
08:45 - right there
08:45 - there you go i don't care if you even
08:47 - graduate high school
08:49 - all right it doesn't matter guys see
08:51 - these companies are starting to
08:52 - understand finally that
08:54 - that that we don't need degrees that
08:57 - college
08:57 - college is useful especially for like
08:59 - software engineering it has changed a
09:01 - lot
09:02 - it has changed so much that um it's
09:05 - changed to a point of like
09:07 - to a point where where you know we can
09:09 - learn
09:10 - things things online faster and quicker
09:14 - and be more up to date and so that's
09:17 - what even most is talking here about
09:18 - so you're on board with me i hope you
09:20 - are you have you hope you remove that
09:21 - mindset if you don't
09:22 - you need a degree okay so you know just

15:59 - okay very important
16:02 - some of you said you don't need one page
16:04 - resume anymore i still stick to one page
16:06 - doesn't matter because you can put
16:07 - everything you need on one page
16:09 - okay projects i could be you you need to
16:11 - have on top
16:12 - okay so what projects have you done did
16:15 - you do the facebook loan the
16:16 - uh the you know did you build the react
16:19 - home
16:19 - put those projects up top because people
16:21 - want to see experience that's the most
16:22 - important thing
16:23 - okay next up uh let me go back projects
16:26 - experience experience okay
16:30 - so what where have you worked at and
16:32 - then references so what people you trust
16:34 - who people can contact okay
16:36 - very important next up
16:39 - tips use impactful
16:42 - words what does this mean
16:46 - what does this mean what do you think it
16:47 - means it's very simple impactful words
16:49 - are words that
16:50 - that stand out to a recruiter or
16:54 - sorry i need my water to a recruiter or
16:58 - to anyone else or even to a machine who
17:00 - reads your resume potentially
17:01 - okay what impactful words are
17:04 - things like for example you know i
17:06 - improved
17:08 - a certain product so when you were
17:09 - talking about let me give an example
17:11 - when you were talking about
17:13 - and i'll give this example in a resume
17:15 - that that i kind of have
17:17 - when you were talking about um
17:20 - your experience at a company right let's
17:22 - say you went ahead
17:24 - and so let me go ahead and let me let me
17:26 - let me go ahead i'm gonna use screen
17:28 - brush here
17:32 - i'm going to say for example let's say
17:33 - you went ahead and at a company
17:35 - you went ahead and you where's my screen
17:41 - okay and at the company you went ahead
17:43 - and
17:44 - in the company you um
17:48 - you build a new website
17:51 - build right a website okay
17:55 - website okay you can say i built a
17:58 - website
17:59 - somebody said drinking one gallon of
18:00 - water yes i will be drinking won't get
18:02 - underwater
18:05 - so you can save one building or building
18:07 - um a website
18:08 - or under in your resume you can say
18:10 - something else
18:12 - which is gonna be better okay check this
18:14 - out now
18:15 - you can say now this
18:18 - what if you said what if you said what
18:20 - have you said
18:22 - um improved
18:25 - and proved uh site performance
18:31 - for for performance or
18:34 - what if you said what if you said
18:37 - okay what if you said um added
18:42 - 50 more leads
18:46 - right right through
18:50 - through
18:53 - through a new site right a new site
18:57 - right so what you're trying to do is
18:58 - you're trying to show results because
18:59 - that is
19:00 - what that is what that is what people
19:03 - are looking for that's required they're
19:05 - trying to show results right so
19:06 - increase efficiency right increase
19:09 - efficiency in something
19:11 - whatever it is you need to show results
19:14 - okay increase efficiency maybe um
19:17 - for example you know uh added edit
19:21 - 200 what is it edit 200 new clients
19:27 - okay improve the process
19:30 - okay improved improved
19:34 - the process okay maybe you decreased
19:37 - time decreased decreased process time i
19:40 - don't know
19:41 - i don't know what you did increase
19:42 - process time
19:44 - the main thing is actionable words
19:48 - okay so somebody oh ankit thanks so much
19:51 - thanks so much for thanks so much for
19:53 - the donation really appreciate my friend
19:56 - let me go ahead and let me show that let
19:58 - me show that let me show that for you
19:59 - hold on hold on
20:00 - hold on i'm keep 100 100
20:03 - 100 pesos i think that's what should i i
20:06 - could actually ask the question let me
20:07 - ask you let me
20:08 - show you this question let's see this
20:11 - question here
20:12 - let me go ahead and see this question
20:13 - right here boom
20:16 - boom give me a second here guys
20:23 - boom wait wait wait come on come on
20:29 - ah screen brush
20:35 - hold on guys where is this oh there it
20:38 - is okay i'm back here
20:39 - okay but i'm still not but i want to be
20:42 - hold on hold on give me a second here
20:46 - okay
20:51 - oh wait i got it oh there we go it's all
20:53 - good now
21:02 - [Music]
21:11 - anybody know how to quit this
21:18 - hold on give me a second guys check this
21:21 - out okay
21:22 - check this out what can we do can i what
21:23 - can i do what can i do with this one
21:25 - hold on
21:39 - okay there it is
21:43 - i know something has happened that's why
21:58 - thank god it's not quitting screen brush
22:01 - this is very funny
22:03 - oh thank god okay all right i got it
22:05 - we're good we're back we're back thank
22:06 - you for being here
22:07 - let's take a look with me we're back
22:10 - we're back guys okay no we're not back
22:12 - never mind
22:15 - now we're back okay all right we're good
22:17 - all right we're good here we go good all
22:19 - right so
22:19 - before before i go forward before i go
22:22 - forward i just want to go ahead and
22:24 - actually i want to show i want to show
22:25 - my
22:26 - friend here
22:29 - so ankit yes the question you asked the
22:32 - question let's see
22:34 - that's a question of i'm not good what
22:36 - should i do is i feel a lot of pressure
22:38 - at my job i'm worried should i quit and
22:40 - learn and help
22:41 - me i'm a front and react direct
22:43 - developer with one year experience i'm
22:44 - not good
22:45 - what should i do is i feel a lot of
22:47 - pressure what should you do
22:49 - um if what should you do you should just
22:52 - keep going
22:53 - you should not quit oh please god no
22:55 - please don't quit no do not quit my
22:57 - friend
22:57 - uh you need to keep going um honestly
23:00 - very important
23:01 - um it's hard right now it's hard right
23:03 - now but it's got
23:04 - going to get a lot easier you have to
23:06 - kind of push through it you know a lot
23:07 - of us kind of go through this
23:08 - you know imposter syndrome and so forth
23:10 - but once you get past it it's gonna be a
23:12 - lot easier so please
23:13 - keep going trust me um you know ask
23:16 - questions you know get help from others
23:18 - maybe potentially you know take on some
23:20 - coaching whatever you need to do
23:22 - but do not quit okay please don't
23:26 - because i'll be very sad alrighty keep
23:30 - going
23:30 - cool so we talked about impactful words
23:33 - right next thing let's talk about
23:35 - github links so i an under description
23:38 - of your experience of your project if
23:39 - your experiences
23:40 - kind of like how i have here you see
23:42 - guys how i have i don't know if you guys
23:43 - can see this uh
23:44 - easily but i have my projects right here
23:48 - and then my experience is right here
23:50 - okay and then under my experiences right
23:52 - actually i'm sorry under my project you
23:53 - can see that github links right here
23:55 - okay
23:56 - github links so make sure to add all the
23:58 - github links
24:00 - the amount of times that people have
24:01 - come to me have came to me and
24:03 - recruiters have come to me and be like
24:04 - okay yeah thanks so much i checked out
24:06 - your github link
24:08 - and i was able to get a good
24:09 - understanding of what projects you do
24:11 - and what code you write so yeah
24:14 - very important a lot of people miss that
24:15 - part too all right
24:17 - so add github links now let's talk about
24:20 - preparing for the interview this is this
24:21 - was your resume
24:22 - we've gotten we've covered some good
24:23 - resume you've got a good structure now
24:25 - right all is good it shows your resume
24:27 - you know again like i said make sure
24:28 - it's one page and so forth
24:30 - um now let's talk about preparing for
24:32 - the interview
24:34 - okay the perfect interview so
24:38 - google contacts you you're like yo can i
24:40 - please do an interview with you can we
24:41 - do an interview with you like yeah let's
24:43 - do it
24:44 - i'm so happy yeah you know i'm so happy
24:47 - and so step one is you need to start
24:50 - learning algorithms and data structures
24:52 - so
24:52 - unfortunately with every any big company
24:55 - you're gonna have to
24:56 - go through an algorithms algorithms
24:58 - technical interview and i personally
25:00 - hate it
25:01 - i hate it so much but we have to do it
25:03 - like it or not okay
25:04 - and so yeah that's this is uh yep this
25:07 - is going to be not again yep yep we did
25:09 - it again
25:10 - so data structures and algorithms this
25:12 - is this is it's going to be a process
25:14 - for you guys okay it's going to be a
25:15 - process for you in terms of what you
25:17 - need to learn and so forth
25:19 - um now some some things to consider a
25:21 - word to learn from okay
25:23 - a few things uh lead code read code very
25:26 - important tool lead code you can go on
25:27 - lead code and you can actually when you
25:29 - log into leadco you can go ahead and
25:30 - actually select google
25:31 - you know facebook twitter and it will
25:33 - give you algorithm questions
25:35 - based on the company which is really
25:37 - good hackering
25:38 - similar thing okay kraken economy of you
25:40 - you need to get this book
25:43 - you need to get this book trust me okay
25:46 - this is where you'll be learning a lot a
25:48 - lot a lot what happened is everything
25:50 - okay
25:53 - this is where you'll be learning a lot a
25:55 - lot a lot a lot of your a lot of your
25:56 - things
25:57 - so a lot of your uh
26:00 - you know uh you know algorithms are
26:04 - going to become
26:05 - from here especially in terms of
26:06 - understanding it uh this is where it's
26:08 - gonna come from okay
26:10 - so let's talk about what are some
26:13 - companies what companies are looking for
26:15 - in terms of algorithms and so forth
26:19 - well if you look at for example if you
26:21 - look at for example uber
26:23 - you can see they're looking for like
26:24 - dynamic programming uh depth first
26:26 - search this is this is dfs is depth
26:28 - first search so they're searching for
26:31 - search algorithms
26:32 - breadth first search search algorithms
26:34 - looking for math backtracking sorting so
26:36 - one big thing you're going to
26:37 - focus on is you know sorting searching
26:40 - for example through binary search trees
26:42 - okay big manipulation i actually one of
26:44 - my questions came from bit manipulation
26:46 - when i was
26:46 - when i had an interview with pellentier
26:49 - okay
26:49 - sliding window divide and conquer so
26:51 - it's really greedy algorithms
26:53 - right binary search tree is actually a
26:55 - very big one so that's why it's like
26:56 - eighty eight point eight percent
26:58 - next thing microsoft same dynamic
26:59 - programming right depth research you
27:01 - know and so forth
27:02 - again very very very important and you
27:05 - can
27:05 - learn all those things in the book and
27:08 - you can learn all those things
27:09 - through the other resources that we will
27:11 - talk about right right now
27:18 - okay
27:20 - okay let's continue on let's continue on
27:22 - so microsoft
27:23 - you can see interview questions
27:25 - distribution on microsoft
27:27 - trees hash tables okay linked lists
27:30 - right stacks cues all of this you need
27:33 - to be able for example you might be
27:34 - given
27:36 - you might be given for example hey uh
27:39 - you need to go ahead and
27:40 - loop through a linked list okay you need
27:42 - to go and look through the link list and
27:43 - give me the highest number in the link
27:44 - list
27:45 - that might be literally one of your
27:46 - questions and so you need to be able to
27:48 - do that you need so you need to go ahead
27:49 - and understand
27:50 - what to treat what's a hash table what's
27:52 - a linked list what's a stack what's a
27:54 - queue
27:54 - and what functionality or most
27:55 - importantly how do i create
27:58 - create those specific structures okay
28:02 - and you can use it with any language you
28:03 - want maybe that's python maybe it's
28:05 - javascript
28:06 - for me i did it in python because i love
28:08 - python
28:09 - okay because it was easier for me to do
28:10 - those kind of algorithm questions if you
28:12 - want to do all javascript you can do
28:13 - javascript another problem
28:14 - as well okay let's continue on
28:18 - all right same thing uh kind of you know
28:20 - we talked about right top seven
28:22 - some seven algorithms that you know you
28:23 - need to know like this sorting algorithm
28:25 - search algorithms like you know through
28:27 - binary search trees through hashing
28:29 - dynamic programming okay binary
28:32 - exponentiation
28:33 - right all those things don't focus so
28:36 - much like binding expression
28:37 - not so much string matching and parsing
28:39 - yes very important right here
28:41 - very important um probability testing ah
28:46 - not so important now we put the same but
28:48 - some of the things are not important
28:49 - okay so that's going to be a big one for
28:51 - you before i go on though
28:53 - one thing that that i did not put on
28:56 - here is actually going to be
28:58 - what do you think we forgot on here it's
29:00 - something really simple but something so
29:02 - important
29:03 - that my friends is actually it's
29:06 - actually big o notation
29:08 - um big notation so we don't have the
29:10 - line here but big o notation you need to
29:12 - need to know so big o
29:16 - big o notation okay
29:19 - you need to you know what you need to
29:22 - exactly know
29:25 - here's a good picture for you guys check
29:27 - out this cool picture
29:29 - see you need to exactly know
29:32 - right which algorithm so when you go
29:34 - ahead and you do an algorithm
29:36 - you know let's say you know you solve
29:37 - the problem you need to know hey
29:39 - is my solution is that big o of n
29:42 - squared
29:42 - big o of n big o of log n or big o of
29:45 - one
29:46 - now you might be asking what is this i
29:48 - have no idea what what is big o
29:50 - you go just a o right what do you need
29:53 - to know about big go
29:54 - well here's the thing guys
29:57 - okay with big o what you need to
30:00 - understand is very simple
30:02 - uh you need to understand that
30:05 - you need to understand that that uh let
30:07 - me see let me see let me see let me see
30:09 - you need to understand that it's about
30:11 - complexity it's about like how fast does
30:13 - your algorithm work
30:15 - okay so one example here
30:18 - one example here is for example let me
30:21 - zoom into here
30:22 - boom let me open up let me open up the
30:24 - fancy
30:28 - is it option tab
30:31 - screen brush come on
30:35 - oh no that's not what i want
30:41 - there we go okay
30:45 - there you go so here so here for example
30:50 - here okay very important so big o of n
30:53 - is when the function runs in constant
30:55 - time so for example if it's
30:57 - you know you can see here this is a
30:58 - function okay you know it's first
31:00 - element
31:01 - and this simply all it does is it
31:02 - returns an element okay it's just it
31:04 - just
31:05 - returns now that's all it does it's
31:07 - nothing too much okay
31:09 - so it does you know it does one function
31:11 - if you scroll down
31:13 - if you scroll down big o of n big o of n
31:16 - is
31:17 - let's say you have a list now you have a
31:19 - list now
31:21 - oops that's not what i want you have a
31:24 - list now and
31:25 - you look into the whole list and so
31:27 - you're saying that my
31:28 - my algorithm runs as fast
31:32 - as the the length of the list
31:35 - so if my list is a million a million
31:37 - arrays like a mirror
31:38 - you know is a million right um
31:42 - then my algorithm is gonna long run for
31:44 - longer time right
31:45 - if my list is 10 for example
31:48 - 10 you know elements it's gonna run for
31:50 - that long the time it's very important
31:52 - very poor stuff so you can see right the
31:54 - looping through they have a for each
31:55 - loop here
31:56 - and you know that's looping through all
31:57 - the elements that's big o of n
32:00 - now big o of n squared i don't want to
32:02 - get too much interest right big o one
32:03 - squared because squared is like for
32:05 - example
32:05 - is when you go ahead and you have a loop
32:07 - and you have another within another loop
32:09 - right so now you have two loops
32:10 - so you loop it through the loop twice
32:12 - that's where you have big o of n squared
32:13 - right and that makes the algorithm a lot
32:15 - less um
32:16 - a lot run a lot more slower right or a
32:19 - lot longer
32:20 - right you know which you know increases
32:22 - complexity so you have to know these
32:24 - type of things again i don't want to get
32:25 - too much into it but i just wanted you
32:26 - know could just kind of
32:28 - uh lightly brush it okay but this is
32:30 - something that you have to know
32:32 - because obviously obviously what we want
32:35 - do we want an algorithm that goes
32:37 - an algorithm that's this fast or do we
32:40 - want an algorithm that's this fast
32:42 - what's better obviously this one right
32:45 - the goal of n and so that's what they
32:47 - look for they look for can ukraine
32:48 - algorithm that's like big goal when
32:50 - by the way want to save thomas so much
32:51 - thanks let's see somebody somebody asked
32:54 - somebody asked we got wills
32:58 - wills donate two pesos thanks so much so
33:01 - disguises still have 400 js and python
33:03 - courses yes we still have the pipeline
33:04 - courses hundred dollar courses guys
33:06 - there are link in the description to
33:07 - them if you want to check them out okay
33:10 - um yeah we still have the courses and
33:12 - will wilson thanks so much for the
33:14 - donation appreciate it my friend
33:15 - all right let's continue on
33:19 - we talked about what you need to do now
33:20 - let's talk about one of the most
33:22 - important things
33:23 - um one of the most important things you
33:26 - can do to prepare for an interview
33:28 - or something you said it's heroes
33:30 - non-pesos heroes thank you so much
33:31 - cassie
33:33 - all right so one of the most important
33:35 - things you can do is
33:37 - for an interview is actually is it's um
33:41 - it's doing mock interviews so what mock
33:43 - interviews are
33:44 - my friends what mock interviews are is
33:47 - they are simply basically
33:49 - you having a fake interview with someone
33:51 - else so maybe you it's your friend
33:53 - okay maybe it's it's whoever it might be
33:56 - maybe it's your friend or my whatever it
33:57 - might be
33:58 - but it's you doing a mock interview now
34:00 - there's a ton of mock interviews on
34:01 - youtube which i highly recommend you
34:03 - could you go check them out even google
34:04 - for example has one okay
34:06 - how to work at google right there's a
34:08 - ton of uh interviews for example
34:10 - the author of cracking the kona
34:11 - interview right
34:13 - she has an amazing mock interviews crack
34:16 - in the coding interview amazing
34:18 - interviews for example um on google so
34:20 - just in google type in
34:21 - you know cracking according interview um
34:23 - you know click
34:24 - on if you crack in the kona interview a
34:27 - video with dna right here just type it
34:28 - into google and you should be fine
34:30 - okay before i move on i actually i want
34:33 - to address something
34:34 - i'm going to address something really
34:35 - quickly here we have let me see let me
34:38 - see let me see we have
34:39 - someone else donate donate anik ankit
34:42 - donate yet
34:43 - once again appreciate my friend so much

38:31 - things that i i want you to touch base
38:33 - again really really really fast i want
38:34 - you to kind of write this stuff down i'm
38:36 - going to go through
38:37 - things and i'm going to explain some
38:38 - things for you you know kind of from my

38:41 - um so one dress clean okay
38:46 - you don't want to look like a bum okay
38:49 - dress clean
38:50 - look like a million bucks you don't have

38:57 - but just dress clean just be fresh you
38:59 - know look fresh you know
39:01 - nobody wants to nobody wants to you know
39:04 - go ahead and interview someone or work
39:05 - with someone uh who's just you know
39:08 - uh you know maybe smells bad or
39:09 - something i don't know but
39:12 - ask questions so really important you
39:15 - need to ask
39:16 - questions you need to have for example i
39:17 - had questions prepared okay
39:19 - so you know let me go ahead and i will
39:21 - do this
39:25 - have questions questions
39:30 - prepared ahead of time
39:35 - okay ahead of time really important guys
39:42 - have questions prepared ahead of time
39:44 - okay
39:46 - so you know maybe for example one big
39:48 - question that i like to ask
39:50 - is so you know what team
39:53 - what team are you working for so when
39:56 - you're
39:56 - working for okay the reason why you're
39:58 - doing this is you're building rapport
40:00 - with your interviewer okay maybe i say
40:02 - okay
40:03 - how many you know um how many
40:06 - how many team members members okay
40:10 - you might be asking the question of like
40:11 - okay um
40:14 - what what is your process
40:18 - is your process right what that shows
40:21 - is that you care about things that's
40:24 - going on
40:26 - in the world in in that company you care
40:29 - about that
40:30 - that's very important okay then you
40:32 - might be asking the question okay what's
40:33 - your process maybe ask a question okay
40:35 - you know um what interests you the most
40:37 - about
40:38 - this company about this job what
40:39 - interests you
40:45 - you the most right again you're trying
40:47 - to get
40:48 - you're trying to let me show yeah what
40:50 - interests you the most right you need
40:52 - to get your bullet rapport with with the
40:54 - recruiter very important stuff okay
40:57 - let's go ahead and do this all right so
40:59 - ask questions i had questions prepared
41:01 - kind of you know and then obviously as i
41:02 - was talking about the person
41:03 - i went ahead and i you know i asked more
41:06 - questions depending on how the
41:07 - conversation is going
41:08 - so you have to prepare and kind of um
41:10 - you know
41:13 - well talk with people just imagine the
41:14 - recorder is your friend that's it
41:16 - it's as simple as that imagine the
41:18 - recruiter is your friend
41:21 - next talk slow
41:24 - please for the please talk slow um i say
41:28 - this a lot when in my in my coaching and
41:30 - my
41:30 - private coaching when i when i coach
41:32 - students um
41:34 - i say this a lot guys you know don't
41:36 - don't be like hey guys how's it going
41:38 - guys you know you know
41:39 - i really want to talk about you know
41:40 - this is so cool you know so what you
41:41 - guys are doing
41:42 - it is so awesome uh i really love we
41:44 - know what's going on here you know
41:45 - you know i've been doing this kind of
41:46 - stuff you know i have been working on
41:48 - algorithm questions i have been working
41:50 - at this company this company and i went
41:51 - ahead but
41:56 - we're thinking about that not good
42:01 - right so slow and steady wins the job
42:04 - exactly as lump said real nicely that's
42:07 - really good
42:08 - slow and steady so hey guys yeah so you
42:10 - know for example when you
42:11 - when you get asked the question um when
42:13 - you get asked the question of uh you
42:16 - know so tell me about yourself
42:17 - just like hey yeah so of course so yeah
42:19 - you know about two years ago i went
42:21 - ahead and i
42:22 - started uh working at a company called
42:24 - trandala
42:25 - it's just this is a startup company that
42:27 - kind of you know i approached two of my
42:28 - friends
42:29 - and i asked them if i can work with them
42:31 - you know and they kind of give me a
42:32 - chance that's where i learned
42:34 - my first experience right after that i
42:36 - kind of went to another company where i
42:38 - went ahead
42:39 - you know and i built i built some really
42:40 - cool machine learning stuff right i
42:42 - built
42:42 - a machine learning process to go ahead
42:44 - and you know
42:46 - and predict a number of leads for the
42:48 - next few you know next few months and so
42:50 - forth
42:51 - and so forth so you're taking it slow
42:52 - and steady but you're just taking that
42:54 - you're taking your life and you're
42:55 - showing your experience of what you've
42:57 - done
42:57 - okay that's it let's say no i need to be
42:59 - like
43:01 - because i have some i have some students
43:02 - who are like just go fast fast fast
43:04 - which is okay but you can you can you
43:06 - know talk slow
43:08 - repeat the question okay what does that
43:11 - mean
43:12 - when i keep switching this because i'm
43:14 - talking to a camera and i want to make
43:16 - sure you understand this correctly
43:17 - when okay when you go ahead
43:21 - and they ask you the algorithm question
43:24 - at the interview
43:26 - so let's say they ask you hey now so
43:28 - let's go ahead and you know let's go
43:30 - ahead and
43:31 - sort a list a list of um
43:34 - names okay so sort of list of names you
43:38 - know we have this is
43:40 - this is we have this list coming into a
43:42 - function right we want to go ahead and
43:44 - divide the list initially
43:45 - but then you know we want to emerge that
43:47 - list together
43:48 - and the goal is to return return you
43:51 - know a sorted list
43:52 - you know to back to the api whatever it
43:54 - might be so
43:55 - as the interviewee as me as me
43:59 - the person being interviewed you want to
44:02 - repeat
44:03 - what they have just said why
44:07 - the reason why is because that shows
44:09 - that you understood what the problem is
44:11 - and that rephrases that problem back to
44:13 - your mind so that you can actually think
44:15 - about it more better
44:16 - versus if you just if you just said
44:18 - they're quiet like this like you know
44:20 - you're listening to the other person
44:21 - that's great but it's not helpful for
44:23 - you and neither for the recruiter
44:25 - or for the interviewer so repeat the
44:28 - question so
44:29 - you can say things like for example okay
44:30 - great so um okay i understand you that's
44:33 - interesting so you what you're telling
44:34 - me right now
44:35 - is that we need to take in a list a list
44:38 - of
44:38 - uh of names into a function then we need
44:41 - to split up the list maybe you know into
44:44 - that list we can merge the list back
44:46 - together and then we need to go ahead
44:47 - and sort it of course and i'm thinking
44:49 - potentially using like a
44:51 - a loop to sort this and then we need to
44:53 - return a sort of list
44:55 - right so very important so so did that
44:58 - repeat the question and and then when i
45:00 - said ask questions now for example you
45:01 - can say you can say okay
45:03 - great so they say that and they can say
45:05 - okay great so then then you might follow
45:07 - that up with
45:09 - you might follow that up with a question
45:11 - like for example okay
45:13 - um how many lists of names are we
45:15 - expecting
45:16 - is this going to be a huge list right a
45:18 - smaller list right
45:19 - so how many lists how many lists of
45:21 - items are we expecting
45:22 - right so they may say okay it's not not
45:24 - just it should mostly likely
45:26 - might be 20 list of items right so you
45:28 - start asking
45:29 - questions okay so you can say for
45:32 - example and then you can say for example
45:34 - okay i
45:34 - understand this so we have this and this
45:37 - okay
45:38 - and so since we only have 20 list item
45:40 - lists okay
45:41 - i'm thinking no potential just using
45:43 - just a normal loop without anything
45:45 - fancy and they're like okay
45:47 - all right all right so let's continue on
45:49 - so i'm literally taking you right now
45:51 - this is interesting because i'm taking
45:52 - you through a process that i
45:54 - went through this as i'm talking to you
45:55 - guys this literally reminded me of what
45:58 - what i was going through
46:01 - sorry i'm taking my time this is you
46:02 - know what i was going through when i was
46:05 - doing these interviews
46:06 - because they're tough they're tough i
46:08 - know but you know you can they're doable
46:10 - so like i said repeat the question take
46:13 - time to understand
46:14 - the problem do you understand the words
46:18 - that come out of my mouth
46:21 - do you want to do anybody notice this
46:24 - this uh
46:24 - this is coming from this is hilarious
46:27 - yeah
46:28 - this is coming from russia by the way so
46:30 - um
46:31 - so take to understand the problem okay
46:33 - you can say hey and you can say for
46:35 - example
46:35 - i'll do this oftentimes i'll be for
46:38 - example
46:39 - um yes and devon devon
46:42 - said uh you can drink water during
46:44 - interviews it helps you to relax yes
46:46 - very
46:46 - very very very much that's that's a good
46:48 - point
46:50 - so you can say here for example um
46:52 - things like can i can you just give me a
46:54 - minute i kind of just want to you know
46:55 - think about this and then
46:57 - i'll get back to you here in a second
46:58 - here so you can say things like that
47:00 - right say
47:01 - you know just let me think about this
47:02 - and then and then i'll get back to you
47:04 - in a minute
47:05 - okay no problem okay
47:08 - so take time to understand really what
47:11 - the problem is
47:12 - assumptions really important okay
47:15 - a lot of times actually let me go back
47:17 - to here
47:18 - assumptions right here these are the
47:20 - assumptions i'm talking about
47:21 - so some of the some of the questions
47:24 - might be very vague for you
47:26 - the question might be for example maybe
47:28 - the question might be for example for
47:29 - you
47:29 - is like okay you have two parallel lines
47:32 - on a board
47:33 - okay you need to find you know you need
47:35 - to know actually you
47:36 - need you have two crossing lines you
47:37 - need to figure out where
47:39 - are they crossing that was literally one
47:40 - of my questions at a company called
47:42 - palantir
47:43 - right and then you what you need to do
47:46 - is you need to start talking about
47:47 - assumptions
47:48 - you can say for example okay in my
47:50 - assumption can i assume that
47:52 - um can i assume that these parallel
47:54 - lines you know will always continue on
47:56 - on and on they don't stop
47:58 - can i assume that that um
48:02 - can i assume that these these lines
48:05 - these lines for example
48:08 - i think let me think let me think you
48:10 - know can i assume that
48:13 - the data we can get in about these lines
48:16 - are just x by coordinates
48:17 - right so you can say things like that
48:19 - okay but you have to state
48:21 - those assumptions because then because
48:24 - you because you can't make assumptions
48:26 - by yourself okay that's not good that's
48:28 - not good as a developer you shouldn't be
48:30 - ever be doing that you can't just assume
48:32 - and not be doing it you know just assume
48:34 - things you can't just assume things and
48:38 - then
48:39 - then go ahead and go with them without
48:42 - telling anybody about them
48:44 - that's not the way to use our
48:45 - development okay
48:49 - and so you need to talk about those
48:51 - assumptions very important guys
48:54 - let me go ahead and keep going with this
48:57 - it's not wrong it's your process
49:03 - somebody said uh future code nas what do
49:06 - you say it's good to discuss your edge
49:07 - cases first
49:09 - yeah you can talk about edge cases of
49:11 - course you can talk about excuses those
49:12 - are really important
49:13 - i would say you can talk about yeah talk
49:15 - about edge cases is
49:16 - is good too i like that that's that's a
49:18 - good future code that's a that's a good
49:20 - suggestion i like that
49:21 - yes so it's not wrong
49:25 - it's your process what do you think that
49:26 - means let me ask this question huh
49:30 - what they look for what recruiters look
49:32 - for or interviewers look for when they
49:34 - ask you a question
49:37 - another good question it's not so much
49:40 - about are you right or are you wrong
49:46 - it is a lot more about what
49:50 - is your process are you a good developer
49:53 - are you someone who knows
49:55 - how to divide let me go ahead and do
49:58 - this and just really quickly
50:02 - check this out divide
50:05 - and conquer
50:08 - really simple divide and conquer
50:14 - okay can you divide and conquer can you
50:16 - take a huge problem
50:20 - can you take a huge problem that's right
50:21 - in front of you guys okay
50:24 - huge price right in front of you and
50:25 - then divide it into smaller bits and
50:27 - pieces
50:28 - correctly communicated and then
50:32 - solve it even
50:36 - here's the thing it can
50:39 - be wrong guys i'm not kidding
50:43 - your answer your answer to the question
50:46 - can be wrong sometimes well a lot of
50:48 - times
50:49 - they your answer question it's okay if
50:51 - it's if it's not precise you know the
50:53 - most the most correct question
50:56 - so you just say it's not about getting
50:57 - it right it's all about are you able to
50:59 - break your small parts and solve it yes
51:02 - exactly okay it can be wrong
51:06 - so this is why i emphasize so much about
51:08 - this process this is why i talk about
51:10 - these things that communicate
51:11 - ask your questions okay uh take time to
51:14 - understand the problem
51:15 - okay things like that it's such an
51:18 - important aspect
51:20 - okay here's another one here's this
51:21 - important aspect okay check this one out
51:24 - check this check this one out
51:26 - communicate communicate communicate
51:28 - communicate communicate what do i mean
51:30 - by that so
51:32 - what i mean by that so for example i can
51:34 - so i'm gonna i'm gonna you know i'm i'm
51:36 - going to go ahead and um
51:38 - imagine i'm currently being interviewed
51:41 - okay imagine i'm convincing interviews
51:42 - and somebody rich up i see you
51:44 - you asked the question of nas how do you
51:46 - suggest improving communication skills
51:48 - i got you give me a second here so
51:51 - let's go ahead i am being interviewed
51:53 - and i want to go ahead
51:54 - and i need to go ahead and let me go
51:56 - ahead and bring this up
52:00 - and i'm going to talk about somebody
52:01 - asked a question for me okay let's go
52:02 - ahead and create a loop to you know to
52:04 - loop through a list
52:04 - and and and then and then return and
52:07 - then return
52:08 - a started list so see here's how
52:11 - i would go about this process i'll be
52:13 - like okay great so
52:14 - what i'm going to do right now um i want
52:16 - to go ahead and i'm going
52:18 - to loop through the list of items that
52:20 - is given to me in a function
52:21 - i'm going to loop to this list of items
52:23 - then i'm going to use
52:24 - a sorting function like for example like
52:26 - you know a depth first search and not
52:27 - not that
52:28 - a starting function um sorting algorithm
52:31 - where i will just loop through the
52:33 - elements and then i'll check
52:35 - which element is greater than the other
52:38 - element
52:38 - and this will probably be this will
52:40 - probably be a
52:42 - two loops and because i need to sort
52:44 - them i just sort them okay
52:46 - so they're like okay great so go ahead
52:48 - and do that so now i'll say okay i will
52:50 - go ahead okay so
52:51 - so then imagine again i'm being

53:19 - most importantly what i'm trying to say
53:20 - for example and then you can say for
53:21 - example i'm going to loop through now so
53:22 - for loop i'm going to loop through the
53:24 - elements so for
53:25 - for um for element
53:30 - in for element in elements okay
53:33 - boom and so forth so what i'm trying to

55:34 - my assumptions here are my assumptions
55:36 - blah blah and so forth
55:38 - state all those things
55:41 - i sometimes will even write pseudocode
55:43 - you know what pseudo code is
55:44 - so the code is i have a general basic
55:46 - general rule of what
55:48 - the code will look like basically a
55:50 - general like okay maybe
55:51 - for example you know for example i might
55:54 - say for example like okay
55:55 - first i'm going to start off with a for
55:56 - loop then i'm going to start off with
55:59 - for loop then i'm going to loop through
56:01 - you know
56:02 - next loop through
56:06 - next item okay then you can say for
56:10 - example things like
56:11 - okay check check if next item
56:15 - is greater than the first item
56:20 - oh you know i know i don't see that but
56:22 - just just just listen to what i'm saying
56:24 - the first item and so forth and i'm
56:26 - writing pseudocode right now
56:27 - okay i write that out too so write it
56:29 - out okay but also
56:31 - you know be very mindful all the time
56:32 - because you have 45 minutes to complete
56:33 - the stuff
56:36 - but they like that guys they like this
56:38 - kind of stuff because
56:39 - they like someone who communicates well
56:41 - like i said
56:42 - next up show them you're a team player
56:48 - right right nobody wants to work with an
56:51 - [ __ ] i keep saying this all the time
56:53 - i don't want to work with nassau you
56:54 - don't want to work with an [ __ ]
56:56 - correct

57:01 - you want to work with someone who want
57:03 - to work with someone who
57:04 - like i said communicates very well
57:06 - someone who

72:55 - where
72:55 - i went ahead and i did a small coding
72:58 - project without actually talking to
73:00 - anybody
73:00 - then i went through that process and
73:02 - then after that process i went ahead and
73:04 - i talked with a recruiter
73:06 - at the recruiter i had three interviews
73:08 - with three interviews technical
73:09 - interviews
73:10 - um then when i passed those interviews
73:13 - guys i passed those interviews so
73:14 - it's a crazy process like i said when i

73:46 - days of like three days i've ever got
73:49 - so that to me was actually really
73:51 - awesome guys so yeah that was like holy
73:53 - moly
73:54 - that was cool um so i went through that
73:57 - and then obviously
73:58 - interviewed if interview day came prior
74:01 - to the interview i was doing a lot of a
74:03 - lot of practicing from like lead code
74:05 - and hacker inc
74:06 - and so forth so i did a lot of practice
74:08 - through there through that
74:11 - um and like you know like i read the
74:13 - crack and i caught an interview book i
74:15 - was practicing through that
74:16 - very much and what happened up in the
74:18 - end is when the
74:19 - interview time came you know i arrived
74:21 - you know they took my
74:22 - they took everything they took my in my
74:24 - information um
74:26 - at first i talked with someone just in
74:28 - general about
74:29 - about the company about what we got
74:30 - we're about to do and i went straight
74:32 - into the interviews
74:34 - i had my first question my first
74:35 - question i bombed
74:37 - the first question the first question
74:39 - guys i'm not kidding the first question
74:41 - i bombed so badly um it was like it was
74:44 - remember i talked about those
74:45 - those proper those lines that you need
74:47 - to figure out what those lines cross
74:49 - i mean i tried so hard to try and figure
74:50 - it out i just i couldn't
74:52 - um it was really hard for me so like and
74:54 - i kept trying kept trying
74:56 - he helped me out the person helped me
74:57 - out in the end and
74:59 - you know um but in the end i think we
75:01 - kind of like
75:02 - we kind of we solved it we solved it not
75:06 - so much by myself so i wasn't too proud
75:08 - of that
75:08 - but uh but i think my process was good
75:12 - like
75:12 - i communicated everything very well and
75:14 - so he appreciated that so i connect i
75:16 - connected with that person very well
75:17 - then my second interview i did i did
75:19 - pretty good uh my second interview was
75:21 - pretty good
75:21 - i don't remember what question that was
75:23 - but um you know
75:24 - again kind of come in a second person so
75:27 - basically what happens is that let's say
75:28 - you are in a room
75:30 - one person leaves another interviewer
75:32 - comes in then you're done with that
75:34 - that person leaves another interviewer
75:36 - comes in then you're done with that
75:37 - you that person leaves another interview
75:39 - comes in so you have four
75:40 - back to back four yeah four not three
75:43 - four
75:44 - four back to back interviews so it's
75:48 - tough guys it's it's not easy it's tough
75:50 - like you're going to be dead tired by
75:53 - the end of this
75:55 - granted really cool thing a little thing
75:58 - that happened to me personally
76:00 - um really cool thing
76:03 - really cool thing is like uh at the end
76:06 - no actually after my second interview we
76:08 - had a lunch break which is really cool
76:10 - we had a lunch break
76:11 - um and and a googler
76:15 - they call them googler so people who
76:17 - basically people who work at google they
76:18 - come googlers
76:19 - actually took me and took me to lunch
76:22 - and it was so cool it was so cool it
76:24 - took me to lunch and
76:26 - and we went to lunch and i got to talk
76:28 - with the person right i got to talk with

76:30 - and i asked and i asked the person oh by
76:32 - the way the launch was free
76:34 - lunch was free and it was amazing
76:35 - because lunch at google is free

77:14 - and i talked with the googler which is
77:16 - really interesting
77:17 - uh we went ahead and and and um

77:23 - question i was like how did you get to
77:25 - google
77:26 - okay and the person said that
77:29 - the person didn't even have a degree
77:33 - there was no degree guys i'm looking
77:35 - interesting so way how she's like
77:37 - so i actually got a job at google after
77:39 - high school
77:41 - after high school so when the person was
77:43 - like 17 years old or 17 or 18 years old
77:45 - they got a job at google
77:47 - what how so they explained
77:52 - well what they were doing is they were
77:54 - they were um
77:56 - that person was was building projects or
78:00 - was helping out projects on stack
78:02 - overflow
78:03 - yep on stack over they were helping out
78:06 - with projects
78:07 - and there was a specific project they
78:08 - were helping out with and google noticed
78:11 - them
78:13 - google noticed them helping out with
78:16 - those specific projects
78:18 - and the next thing you know next thing
78:20 - you know
78:22 - google contacts that person and is like
78:24 - hey would you like to work here
78:29 - boom done done
78:32 - that's it now that person is working at
78:35 - google and has been working for the past
78:37 - i don't know how long
78:40 - a person i was 30 years old doesn't have
78:43 - a degree
78:45 - graduated high school and went to google
78:49 - all that person did was simply showed
78:51 - interest and the ability
78:53 - to do something by themselves in the
78:56 - ability
78:57 - and the the earning this this earning
79:00 - inside to learn
79:03 - to learn and to grow and you know and to
79:06 - you know to help out the company right
79:09 - it showed the company that's what the
79:11 - companies want to see they want to see
79:12 - someone who
79:13 - it thrives to learn to grow
79:16 - you know uh from scratch even
79:18 - potentially right because
79:19 - you know for example you know google do
79:21 - you let me ask this question do you
79:22 - think google
79:23 - actually cares if you know a programming
79:26 - language
79:28 - or python or javascript do you think
79:30 - they care about what kind of a program
79:31 - do you know hell no
79:35 - no they don't they don't care what
79:37 - programming language you know
79:38 - because they can teach you that they
79:40 - care about
79:42 - one how good of a person are you two
79:45 - okay two is is how can you divide up a
79:49 - problem a problem
79:50 - into smaller problems and how good of a
79:52 - problem solver are you
79:53 - that's it that's all i care about
79:56 - okay very important stuff guys and so
79:59 - yeah i talked with that person i thought
80:00 - was really cool
80:01 - we grabbed some lunch and so forth and
80:02 - then you know after that
80:05 - i had two more interviews two or three
80:06 - more interviews
80:08 - two or three interviews i think those
80:10 - went pretty well they told me they let
80:12 - me know you know how things going

83:08 - devin this is funny oh my god you guys
83:14 - yoma of course happy happy enjoyed this
83:17 - somebody said how to be a group good
83:19 - problem solver and kid asked a question
83:21 - how to be a good problem solver and keep
83:23 - that on is just coming from experience
83:26 - you need to learn to take a step back
83:27 - okay you look at the problem
83:29 - as a whole right from the you know for
83:31 - example don't
83:32 - most important thing is do not do not
83:35 - rush into
83:36 - do not rush into solving the problem by
83:39 - the way
83:40 - you now rush into coding that's the most
83:42 - important thing take a step back
83:45 - think about okay okay i need to solve
83:47 - this first how do i divide this whole
83:49 - problem first i want you to solve this
83:50 - this first this first this first and
83:52 - this first okay
83:54 - and then do that and then do it again
83:56 - and then do it again and then do it
83:57 - again and again and again again and
83:58 - again and again and again
84:00 - and then it's gonna get easier for you
84:02 - okay
84:03 - do some research right maybe maybe you
84:05 - need to do research on
84:06 - what i really notice is sometimes when
84:08 - i'm really stuck when i'm really stuck
84:10 - and i don't know like you said you're
84:12 - really stuck you don't know what to do
84:13 - you just have to keep researching you
84:14 - just have to keep searching
84:16 - and somehow i don't know how this
84:18 - happens in life
84:20 - somehow it just turns out to where you
84:23 - find the solution
84:24 - or you get yourself out of that rabbit
84:26 - hole that hole that you just dug
84:28 - so deep in but you got yourself out of
84:32 - it
84:32 - somehow it just i don't know how but it
84:34 - just always happens
84:36 - so you just keep keep doing it keep
84:37 - repeating and that's how you
84:39 - improve problem solving also a good way
84:41 - to improve problem solving is to do
84:42 - algorithm questions just like how you
84:44 - know
84:45 - if you guys want us to do algorithm
84:46 - questions if you want me to do a live
84:47 - call an algorithm question i'd be happy
84:49 - to do it
84:49 - let me know in the comments below i'll
