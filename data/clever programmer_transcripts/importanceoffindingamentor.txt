00:00 - hi how are you doing hopefully you had
00:03 - some time to go through my videos either
00:05 - on YouTube or some of my videos at
00:08 - clever programmer comm so you have a
00:11 - sense of how everything is working and
00:15 - hopefully you were able to go through it
00:18 - and learn new things ok that's my
00:20 - ultimate goal now believe it or not
00:23 - there are going to be times where you
00:24 - are going to get stuck all right you're
00:27 - gonna be pulling your hair out and
00:28 - you're gonna be looking at a wall just
00:31 - reflecting on your life decisions and
00:34 - the code and its errors are going to be
00:37 - staring back at you making you think why
00:40 - are you programming still but do not let
00:43 - that deter you please alright that's
00:46 - actually one of the most fun parts of
00:48 - coding but sometimes I understand it can
00:50 - get frustrating when you hit that
00:51 - roadblock and there are times when it's
00:55 - actually completely useless to try to
00:58 - work around it it's spent months
01:00 - learning something that was maybe just a
01:02 - small thing that somebody could have
01:04 - told you okay
01:06 - so what I want you guys to do is if you
01:10 - are stuck and can't get out of it try to
01:13 - find yourself a mentor alright so there
01:16 - is a website you can go to called
01:18 - meetup.com and you can network with
01:21 - other people who are like-minded they
01:23 - could be one step ahead of you two steps
01:25 - ahead of you doesn't matter they could
01:27 - be a professional programmer wherever
01:30 - they are if they can help you that's
01:32 - great or if you guys can make a group
01:35 - and help each other study that is
01:37 - probably the best thing that you can do
01:39 - but if that's something you're having
01:40 - trouble finding and you need a more
01:43 - immediate solution you guys can book a
01:45 - session with me
01:47 - so in our session we will go over
01:50 - whatever your problem is or if you want
01:52 - more general help let's say you want
01:55 - specific and specialized curriculum for
01:57 - yourself that's something we can do as
01:59 - well a few things that you are going to
02:02 - get during the session
02:04 - if that's something that you choose to
02:06 - do you are going to get free
02:09 - downloadable PDF as soon as you book the
02:12 - session so that's going to actually
02:14 - teach you a lot of things and also help
02:16 - prepare you for your first lesson also
02:18 - when we are recording our lesson we will
02:22 - be able to take control of each other's
02:25 - screens so I will be able to code on
02:28 - your screen if you are stuck at a
02:30 - certain point we will be able to share
02:33 - screens and we will be able to record
02:35 - the session so after the session is over
02:37 - I can send you the session and if I want
02:41 - maybe to fast during the lecture with
02:42 - you well you can go through it at your
02:46 - own pace at this point you can either go
02:49 - to meetup.com or try to find a mentor in
02:53 - your local place or you can book a live
02:55 - session with me you can click some link
02:57 - below or around my face and I can help
03:01 - you get through your problem if there is
03:04 - any reason you're unsatisfied or the
03:07 - lesson wasn't helpful or you're just
03:09 - like this guy's boring well I can just
03:11 - refund you okay that is not going to be
03:14 - a problem I want to make sure that you
