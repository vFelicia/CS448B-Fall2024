00:03 - just wanted to chat with you real quick
00:05 - I know over the last couple of weeks
00:07 - I've had a pretty harsh stance around
00:11 - coding and I get that and there's a time
00:13 - and place for that I want to go into
00:14 - something deeper that I was feeling
00:16 - today around coding and like I get so
00:18 - many messages around it and it just
00:20 - people are so torn I can't get myself to
00:24 - do it or it's very hard I just keep
00:26 - getting frustrated people who have jobs
00:28 - and then they're trying to come back and
00:29 - then code an hour a day or whatever and
00:31 - today's message I just want to keep it
00:33 - very very simple my purpose here is just
00:36 - to make sure that you are getting value
00:39 - you're doing something with coding in
00:42 - your journey as a software developer
00:43 - where you're progressing forward and
00:46 - further so let's try something very
00:47 - simple today very easy very easy okay
00:50 - instead of trying to trying so hard on
00:53 - yourself and trying to be motivated to
00:55 - go all in to obsess and to go crazy
00:58 - which is a lot of times my mess and I do
01:01 - believe in it okay there's a time and
01:03 - place for that but if you're not a
01:05 - momentum and you're feeling out of
01:06 - momentum let's start with something
01:08 - really simple I'll prescribe you
01:10 - something specific
01:12 - that if you do that starting today or
01:14 - just even do it today or tomorrow it'll
01:17 - help you tremendously in coding okay
01:19 - even with myself when I'm not motivated
01:21 - or I'm not excited about something and
01:24 - my body is not feeling it really all
01:27 - that's happening is my body isn't giving
01:29 - me dopamine for for that thing that I
01:33 - want to be doing it's just like hey I'm
01:34 - not going to give you a lot of dopamine
01:36 - for this today and you're like
01:38 - like I gotta go and get my dopamine now
01:40 - from swiping on Instagram and swiping
01:43 - through Twitter and swiping through Tick
01:46 - Tock and Instagram reels but when you
01:49 - have that happen here's what you need to
01:51 - do you just need to give yourself a
01:52 - little one small thing to do and then
01:55 - just do that and once you do that your
01:58 - body and your mind will automatically
02:00 - start getting into momentum so let's try
02:02 - something specific today and very easy
02:04 - one and here's what it is I want you to
02:07 - set a schedule okay I want you to just
02:10 - put in your calendar for tomorrow a two
02:13 - hour block of when you're going to code
02:15 - that's it I don't need you to do some
02:17 - heroic Herculean effort where you spend
02:20 - 10 to 15 hours a day coding I don't need
02:22 - you to quit your other job so you get
02:25 - really obsessed over coding let's just
02:27 - start off with something very very
02:28 - simple can we do that let's just start
02:31 - off with
02:33 - schedule it on your calendar for two
02:36 - hours that's it for tomorrow
02:38 - okay could you do that okay that's a
02:40 - very easy step and I and I and I hope
02:43 - and I think that you could take that
02:45 - step and do it
02:46 - just find a time okay so let's just work
02:49 - through it together maybe you might be
02:51 - able to do in the morning so cool let's
02:53 - block uh 7 A.M to 9 A.M in the morning
02:55 - but if you can do it in the morning
02:57 - maybe you could do it after work so fine
02:59 - let's do a 6 p.m to 8 P.M block then I
03:03 - don't need you to be coding hard I don't
03:05 - need you to be obsessing over a lot of
03:07 - things I just need you to be doing
03:09 - something very simple which is
03:11 - all you're going to do at that time is
03:13 - just gonna show up you're gonna sit
03:15 - there and do something related to coding
03:16 - for two hours okay you can be coding and
03:19 - then doing research you could be doing
03:20 - coding and just kind of listening to
03:22 - music
03:24 - and it doesn't need to be an aggressive
03:25 - session it can be pretty simple okay and
03:28 - here's a second step that I'm going to
03:29 - give you so the first step is
03:32 - um scheduled on your calendar and
03:34 - actually follow through and do it
03:35 - because that's the first step that's the
03:37 - most important the second step is
03:39 - optional but do it and I'll hold you
03:41 - accountable okay so here's what I want
03:43 - you to do
03:45 - preferably take a photo of you coding
03:48 - okay so like literally flip your phone
03:51 - take a photo where it has you in the
03:54 - camera okay and then it has your laptop
03:57 - or a computer monitor whatever you're
03:59 - using right in the in the frame
04:02 - of you showing you coding as
04:05 - accountability okay and tag me at
04:07 - cleverkozzy
04:09 - c-l-e-v-e-r-q-a-z-i so just tag me at
04:11 - clever Causey on Instagram that's it and
04:15 - I'll repost all of your things but more
04:18 - importantly than anything okay
04:20 - I want to use this as accountability for
04:22 - you
04:24 - and it also gets me to see who this
04:27 - message is really helping and I want to
04:29 - focus less so much on the algorithm
04:33 - the algorithm helps because it gets the
04:34 - message out to most people but I also
04:36 - just want to focus more deeply working
04:39 - with you one-on-one okay so just do that
04:41 - send me a screenshot tag me and do your
04:45 - two hour coding block if you're
04:47 - committing to that just drop in the
04:49 - comments below I'm committed to coding
04:51 - tomorrow okay so for any one of you
04:53 - who's going to be doing that tomorrow
04:55 - drop it below I'm committed to coding
04:58 - tomorrow and then I'll check in with you
05:00 - tomorrow and we'll see how you guys did
05:01 - all right I'm excited I love your face
05:04 - drop the comment below and I'll see you
