00:03 - for you to learn in 2020 and going into
00:06 - 2021.
00:07 - yo what's up guys this your boy qazi
00:09 - from clever programmer

00:22 - get jobs as developers so please go
00:24 - ahead and do that i will love you
00:26 - forever with that said
00:27 - let's jump straight into the video now
00:29 - these are the shortcuts that i
00:31 - use and there are some shortcuts that i
00:33 - wasn't even using but they are
00:35 - so valuable we decided to pack
00:38 - all eight of them in this one video to
00:41 - give them to you if you enjoy these
00:42 - shortcuts
00:43 - so much and you want more we might even
00:45 - do a part two so if that's
00:47 - ever interesting to you let us know in
00:49 - the comments below now i know there are
00:50 - going to be some of you that are going
00:51 - to be like
00:52 - there's more there's more shortcuts you
00:55 - only mentioned
00:56 - but there's 21 i counted there's a lot
00:59 - of them you can choose to use the ones
01:01 - i'm sharing with you or not these are
01:03 - just the ones i use guys so that's why
01:05 - i'm sharing them with you okay with that
01:06 - said let's
01:07 - jump into it shortcut number one
01:10 - highlight next instance all right so
01:12 - let's say you
01:13 - are coding and you have some type of
01:16 - variable like
01:17 - counter you know we have that
01:18 - incremental variable that's sitting
01:20 - there and just like counting up
01:21 - or you have some other variable and you
01:24 - need to
01:25 - change that from counter but you have
01:27 - eight of them
01:28 - and it's called counter everywhere and
01:30 - instead of counter maybe you want to
01:32 - rename that to the word count
01:35 - how do you go and select all of those
01:37 - counts
01:38 - everywhere well the shortcut is ctrl
01:41 - d if you're on windows command d if
01:44 - you're on a mac
01:45 - that shortcut would allow you to
01:47 - actually highlight those words on a mac
01:49 - which you can also do is you can hold
01:50 - command and then keep going command d
01:52 - command d command d and you can keep
01:53 - selecting multiple of those at the same
01:55 - time and then at the same time you can
01:57 - actually
01:57 - rewrite them all you guys have seen the
01:59 - multiple cursor thing right that visual
02:01 - studio code
02:02 - or we even saw people on sublime text
02:04 - views that's the way to do it so they'll
02:06 - select multiple cursors and then they
02:08 - can actually change
02:09 - all the words simultaneously that one is
02:11 - a very
02:12 - useful one that you can use command d or
02:14 - ctrl d
02:15 - so use that option for number two here's
02:18 - another one that's useful
02:19 - now most of the times i personally
02:21 - actually use the shortcut
02:23 - not that much in visual studio code i
02:25 - actually use it whenever i'm on chrome
02:27 - and i use it
02:28 - all the freaking time this one is
02:30 - command
02:31 - l it selects the current line that
02:34 - you're on
02:35 - and why i love using it on chrome is
02:37 - whenever i do command
02:38 - l it automatically selects the entire
02:40 - url and so then i can change it to
02:42 - whatever i want in visual studio code
02:44 - use it to select the entire current line
02:46 - so maybe you want to delete the current
02:48 - line
02:48 - command l delete or control l on windows
02:51 - delete that is a shortcut for selecting
02:53 - that
02:54 - shortcut number three commenting a line
02:57 - now this is really important because
02:59 - there are many times you're coding and
03:01 - you want to actually turn that line
03:02 - into a comment so how do you do that
03:05 - very very quickly
03:07 - now for most people what they do is
03:08 - they'll go to the start
03:10 - of that line and type in slash slash if
03:13 - you're using javascript or they'll type
03:15 - in pound
03:16 - if you're making a comment in python so
03:19 - don't do that here's a better way just
03:22 - be on that line anywhere you're at hold
03:24 - command
03:24 - and hit slash if you do command slash
03:28 - it's automatically gonna put the comment
03:30 - in whatever language you're using so
03:31 - it's intelligent
03:32 - so if you're doing python it'll
03:34 - automatically put a pound in front of
03:35 - the line if you are using javascript it
03:38 - will automatically put
03:39 - slash slash if you're using html it will
03:42 - automatically
03:43 - put a html comment because most of us
03:46 - always forget how html gets commented i
03:49 - forget that a lot of the times like
03:50 - angle bracket exclamation mark
03:52 - parentheses parentheses like what the
03:54 - hell who came up with that commenting
03:56 - online this
03:57 - is honestly one of the actual most
03:59 - useful shortcuts
04:00 - make sure you actually write this one
04:02 - down you're gonna be needing it shortcut
04:04 - number four
04:05 - uncommenting online this is another
04:08 - thing that you might need to
04:09 - do pretty frequently if you comment
04:11 - something you might wanna also uncomment
04:13 - it common mistake you might make
04:15 - is you might comment it by doing command
04:17 - slash but then you might go back
04:19 - and remove it don't do that instead what
04:22 - you should do
04:22 - is just do the same shortcut again so
04:25 - command slash or control slash on
04:27 - windows
04:28 - that will also uncomment so it'll
04:30 - uncomment
04:31 - and comment there you go shortcut number
04:34 - five
04:34 - move by word this one i really like
04:38 - again if you guys want a more advanced
04:40 - tutorial i can actually do a
04:42 - vim training with you guys and you guys
04:43 - will just like smoke every developer
04:46 - that would be a lot of fun if you're
04:47 - interested let me know in the comments
04:49 - below
04:49 - but for now let's just use the normal
04:52 - way of doing
04:53 - moving word by work this is a very
04:54 - common one and i really want you guys to
04:56 - get this one down and practice all of
04:58 - these
04:59 - if you don't practice them you just
05:00 - watch this video you're like that was a
05:02 - cool video
05:03 - you're not gonna get out of it i
05:05 - want you to actually improve like
05:07 - actually improve your skill and the way
05:10 - you do that is you
05:11 - buy crazy repetition so even if you're
05:13 - watching this video
05:14 - be listening to this video and just like
05:16 - repeating the shortcuts that i'm sharing
05:18 - with you
05:18 - i want you to have a true behavior i
05:20 - care about that one person
05:22 - who's gonna have a real behavioral
05:23 - change out of this not the hundred
05:25 - thousand people are gonna watch this
05:26 - should be like oh it's a cool video
05:28 - moving word by word hold control and
05:30 - press right or left
05:31 - on your keyboard arrows that allows you
05:34 - to go word by words if you're writing a
05:35 - for loop for i
05:36 - in range whatever and you want to go and
05:39 - get all the way to the part that says
05:40 - range
05:41 - it's pretty smart to actually move word
05:43 - by words just hold ctrl
05:45 - move word by word and then if you want
05:46 - to like add a modifier to it
05:48 - it's option right on mac
05:51 - and control right on windows i believe
05:54 - windows users double check beyond that
05:56 - but option right and left to move word
05:59 - by word
06:00 - on mac if you do this it allows you to
06:02 - just move a lot
06:03 - easier why i also really like this is if
06:05 - you add in an additional modifier with
06:07 - it so if you hold
06:08 - option and shift and then you move
06:11 - right and left it will actually select
06:14 - those words
06:15 - for you it'll actually select them and
06:17 - then if you hit delete it'll delete the
06:18 - whole word much better than you sitting
06:21 - there
06:21 - going to the end of a word and then just
06:23 - hitting backspace
06:25 - five times remove it that's silly hold
06:28 - shift
06:28 - hold option left or right select the
06:31 - whole thing delete it in the start your
06:33 - productivity
06:34 - when you're doing these tips is gonna go
06:36 - down so right now you might be watching
06:37 - this you'll be like quasi
06:39 - i'm working the way that i'm working
06:41 - it's totally fine
06:42 - i'm fine nothing bad's gonna happen to
06:44 - me i still have a job
06:47 - here's why i'm saying this your
06:48 - productivity in the start is gonna go
06:50 - down so be ready for that it's gonna
06:51 - keep going down down down
06:52 - then when it starts going up you will
06:54 - actually smoke yourself how you were and
06:56 - the quicker you can be the faster you
06:58 - can actually test your own ideas
07:00 - in the app that you're building or at
07:02 - the job that you're at
07:04 - or whatever it is you're trying to do
07:05 - speed i really believe is
07:07 - one of the things that are extremely
07:09 - extremely important because time is
07:10 - something you never get back
07:11 - option shift if you want to add a
07:13 - modifier cool sounds good let's move on
07:15 - to the next one
07:16 - shortcut number six
07:19 - file switcher this is honestly actually
07:21 - one of the best ones
07:22 - there are some ones that you'll like use
07:25 - you won't use
07:26 - this one is one of those that if you're
07:27 - using visual studio code you kind of
07:30 - must use this one is being able to
07:32 - switch between all
07:33 - files command p use command p
07:36 - or on windows it'll be control p and it
07:39 - lets you be able to switch between files
07:41 - you never
07:42 - want to go and actually select different
07:44 - files this is the fastest way to move
07:46 - between them so i'll just hit command p
07:47 - and boom i'll type in firebase.js
07:49 - command p homescreen.js you don't have
07:51 - to type in the js part you can literally
07:53 - type in f eventually just hit enter or
07:55 - h or login page like l hit enter and
07:58 - just
07:58 - take you to them right away this is
08:00 - really useful especially when you're
08:01 - switching in between
08:02 - two different um pieces of code or two
08:05 - different files
08:06 - another bonus one i'll give you here is
08:08 - do command
08:10 - hold command and then do p p one more
08:12 - time and then let go that will help you
08:14 - switch between the two most recent files
08:17 - this is one of the reasons i actually
08:18 - didn't want to leave
08:19 - pycharm because they had such an easy
08:22 - way to switch between two files that i
08:23 - couldn't find anywhere else and i
08:25 - finally found it and sonny actually
08:26 - shared this with me on visual studio
08:28 - code so command pp
08:29 - and let go instantly command pp let go
08:31 - instantly and it'll allow you to switch
08:33 - between two files
08:34 - right away shortcut number seven the
08:37 - transporter now this one is very
08:39 - exciting
08:40 - because this is another one that i
08:42 - personally use
08:43 - all the freaking time and it helps me
08:45 - move really fast
08:47 - and this will help you move from the
08:49 - start of a line to an end of a line or
08:50 - from an
08:51 - end of a line to the start of the line
08:53 - or from the top of the page to the
08:55 - bottom of the page
08:56 - what is this all you have to do if
08:58 - you're on mac is hold command
08:59 - and right that alone will help you move
09:02 - all the way to the right command left
09:03 - will help you move all the way to the
09:04 - left command up or down will help you
09:06 - move
09:07 - all the way to the top of the page or
09:08 - all the way to the bottom of the page
09:10 - oftentimes if i'm coding and i'm
09:12 - jumping straight into a file that i was
09:14 - coding on let's say yesterday when i
09:16 - jump into it usually if i'm trying to
09:18 - write new code by default
09:20 - i'm just trying to get all over the
09:21 - bottom right away so without even
09:22 - thinking as soon as i open a file just
09:24 - do command down it takes me all the way
09:26 - to the bottom
09:26 - if i need to then change something or
09:28 - delete something i do command and do
09:30 - right and it takes me all the way to the
09:32 - end of the line now you can also use
09:33 - modifiers with this so this is the cool
09:35 - part you can actually hold command
09:37 - shift and do right now not only will you
09:40 - move you will select
09:41 - everything in your movement you'll
09:44 - select
09:45 - everything in that line if you do
09:46 - command shift and do right you do
09:48 - command shift and do down from the top
09:50 - of the page
09:51 - not only will you move down but you will
09:52 - select everything on the page
09:55 - learn these these are gonna uh anything
09:58 - that has to do with movement
10:00 - and being able to move faster will add
10:02 - up
10:03 - and save you tons and tons of time over
10:06 - a period of one month two months six
10:08 - months to 12 months it will literally
10:10 - add up to
10:11 - hours and hours of free time for you
10:14 - shortcut
10:14 - number eight auto complete now
10:18 - this is the one that i really hope most
10:20 - of you
10:21 - are already using if you're not you're
10:24 - spending a lot of time
10:25 - doing something that could be very very
10:27 - easily done already
10:28 - and it's tab if you hit tab whether
10:31 - you're on windows or a mac
10:32 - it will auto complete the thing that
10:34 - you're trying to write so if you're
10:35 - trying to write
10:36 - function and you write f u n and you hit
10:39 - tab
10:40 - it will probably auto completed the
10:42 - function for you if you already have a
10:43 - variable like
10:44 - counter and you do count and you hit tab
10:48 - it will auto complete it to counter this
10:50 - is also
10:51 - very very useful in the command line a
10:53 - lot of people i see them
10:54 - miss out on it in the command line and
10:56 - they will like write out the entire word
10:59 - for where they're trying to go
11:00 - when instead they could have just wrote
11:02 - they could just hit tab
11:04 - and it will auto complete it for you and
11:06 - in command line it's
11:07 - cool even if you have something like zsh
11:09 - if you keep hitting tab
11:10 - it will start actually selecting and
11:12 - scrolling through the choices as well so
11:14 - that you
11:15 - really don't have to write you can just
11:16 - keep hitting tap tap tap hit enter and
11:18 - like going to those folders
11:19 - so there you have it folks the best
