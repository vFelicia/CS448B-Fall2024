00:00 - this video is brought to you by
00:01 - squarespace yo what is up guys
00:03 - daniel here and today i'm going to teach
00:05 - you how you can land a job
00:06 - as a full stack javascript developer and
00:09 - i'm going to teach you about the things
00:10 - that i've been able to do to be able to
00:12 - get job offers from companies such as
00:14 - blue origin
00:15 - microsoft and google so let's get into
00:17 - it so you might be curious
00:18 - what exactly is a full stack developer
00:21 - what's quite simple when you look at any
00:23 - web application mobile application or
00:24 - just any application in general
00:26 - there's two different components there's
00:28 - the front end and there's the back
00:30 - end so the front end is all the nice ui
00:33 - or the user interface that the user gets
00:35 - to see
00:36 - whenever they go to the application and
00:38 - the back end is all the data
00:40 - that is being stored so that the
00:42 - application is actually useful
00:44 - and functional so when you combine both
00:46 - of those together
00:48 - that is the full stack and if you're a
00:50 - full stack developer you understand how
00:52 - to build an
00:53 - end to end application now full stack
00:56 - development
00:57 - is actually growing and it keeps on
00:59 - growing year after year after year in
01:01 - fact
01:01 - if you just get an entry-level job if
01:03 - you check out indeed
01:04 - you'll see that the salary will be a six
01:07 - figure salary
01:08 - so especially if you're just getting
01:10 - started straight out of college if you
01:11 - want to do a career transition
01:13 - it's a great and open opportunity to get
01:16 - into
01:16 - and i'll tell you something even now
01:18 - most of the front end positions
01:20 - or the back end positions still require
01:22 - you to know a little bit
01:24 - about the opposition so you still kind
01:26 - of have to be
01:27 - a full stack developer now in this video
01:30 - i'm going to take you step by step i'm
01:33 - going to give
01:34 - you the road map to becoming a full
01:36 - stack developer and then
01:38 - how you can land the dream six figure
01:41 - developer job but before we get into
01:42 - that
01:43 - make sure to like this video so that the
01:45 - youtube algorithm could push this out to
01:47 - everyone else that we can impact and
01:48 - help
01:49 - more people land the six figure full
01:51 - stack developer job
01:52 - so let's get into this roadmap so the
01:54 - way i've broken it down
01:55 - is there's two main parts to becoming
01:58 - and landing
01:59 - your full stack javascript developer the
02:01 - first part is composed
02:03 - of becoming the full stack developer and
02:05 - the second part is about how do you
02:07 - market yourself
02:08 - how do you position and put yourself out
02:10 - there so that
02:11 - you can land your job as a full stack
02:14 - javascript developer
02:15 - so let's go ahead and dive into part
02:17 - number one to really master and become a
02:19 - full stack
02:20 - javascript developer you're gonna want
02:22 - to start
02:23 - with the fundamentals of programming so
02:26 - what exactly are the fundamentals of
02:28 - programming
02:28 - i'm talking data types conditionals
02:31 - loops and you go on to functions you
02:34 - start to build out
02:35 - objects you start to leverage things
02:37 - such as arrays
02:38 - data structures and algorithms all these
02:41 - different components
02:42 - allow you to really understand what
02:44 - programming is
02:45 - to its essential core once you've been
02:48 - able to master these and get a good
02:50 - understanding
02:51 - at this point you can expand into any
02:53 - other language or any other framework
02:55 - because these languages especially for a
02:56 - full stack developer
02:58 - are basically all the same thing it's
03:00 - just different syntax
03:01 - and by syntax i mean a different way of
03:04 - writing it
03:04 - so something i want to emphasize is i
03:07 - want you to focus
03:08 - on these fundamentals and not
03:10 - necessarily on what language or what
03:12 - framework you're picking up
03:13 - because if you're focused on trying to
03:15 - learn all these different frameworks and
03:16 - languages
03:17 - and you miss the fundamentals you are
03:20 - not going to become
03:21 - a great programmer and in order to be a
03:23 - full stack javascript developer that
03:25 - actually gets hired
03:27 - you have to understand the fundamentals
03:28 - and be a great program so once you learn
03:30 - the foundations to being
03:32 - a programmer a developer a problem
03:34 - solver now you're gonna want to dive
03:37 - into front end development so by now you
03:40 - probably are using a language such as
03:42 - python or javascript
03:44 - so you understand the foundations of
03:46 - programming
03:47 - now you want to leverage other languages
03:49 - such as html and css and combine them
03:51 - with your skills of javascript
03:53 - so that you could build front-end
03:55 - applications again this would mean that
03:57 - you dive in there
03:58 - and you build the ui of a web page you
04:00 - build the buttons you build the forms
04:02 - you're able to build out a webpage that
04:04 - is very aesthetic and has a nice appeal
04:06 - to it and this is important because you
04:08 - could start to dive into realm such as
04:10 - ux or user experience sometimes
04:13 - front end receives a lot of hate because
04:15 - people tend to think it's a lot more
04:17 - simpler but if facebook or instagram
04:21 - or robinhood or any of these
04:23 - applications
04:24 - had a horrible user experience and the
04:26 - bad front ends
04:27 - you would not be using them in fact your
04:30 - favorite applications
04:31 - have an amazing front end which is easy
04:34 - to look at and easy to use
04:36 - so again the languages you're going to
04:37 - want to make sure you understand here
04:39 - are going to be
04:40 - html javascript and css and then on top
04:44 - of that
04:44 - you're going to want to use frameworks
04:46 - because that's going to allow you to
04:48 - leverage these three together
04:49 - in a more marketable fashion so that you
04:52 - could land a job
04:53 - so what frameworks might just include
04:55 - react view
04:56 - angular these are just some of the names
04:59 - of the few frameworks that you could
05:00 - leverage here so at this point
05:02 - you build your foundational skills as a
05:04 - developer
05:05 - you've been able to master front-end
05:06 - development although maybe your
05:08 - applications might not be too useful
05:10 - because now you need to master
05:12 - back end development so the third part
05:15 - of learning and becoming a master and a
05:16 - full stack developer is
05:18 - the backend development because in the
05:20 - back end is where you're actually going
05:21 - to store the data
05:22 - that is going to be useful for your
05:24 - application once you have data that you
05:26 - could store for a long period of time
05:29 - now you could build full out
05:30 - applications this is where you're gonna
05:32 - have to learn
05:33 - more about node.js mongodb how to
05:36 - leverage firebase
05:37 - how to use sql how to create sql queries
05:40 - and most importantly you're gonna have
05:42 - to learn about apis because once you
05:44 - have the front end
05:45 - and once you have the back end you have
05:46 - to make sure that they could talk to
05:48 - each other and pass the right data
05:50 - and that's where the api comes in so now
05:53 - you're saying this is great this is
05:54 - awesome daniel
05:55 - but how do i actually start to practice
05:58 - these things
05:59 - well don't worry we have you there the
06:01 - thing that you want to do the number one
06:02 - thing that you want to focus on
06:04 - is building applications and building
06:07 - projects
06:08 - if you can make them more like real life
06:10 - projects such as the netflix clones and
06:12 - the amazon clones that we've put out in
06:14 - our channel
06:15 - you'll have the advantage of being able
06:16 - to attract attention
06:18 - from recruiters but not only that you're
06:20 - gonna get real life experience you're
06:22 - gonna know what it's like
06:24 - to build these applications so when a
06:25 - company is trying to recruit someone who
06:27 - knows what they're building
06:28 - you've already built it a couple times
06:30 - so when you're building out these real
06:32 - life applications you could do at
06:33 - every step of the process when you go
06:35 - back to step one of learning the
06:36 - foundations
06:37 - you could start to build projects that
06:39 - focus on
06:41 - building those foundational skills up
06:42 - when you start to learn front end
06:44 - you could build applications for that we
06:46 - start to learn back end
06:47 - you could build applications for that
06:49 - and as you're building these real-life
06:50 - applications
06:51 - you're going to get better and better at
06:53 - your craft and here's another thing you
06:55 - also want to leverage when you're
06:56 - building these applications and you're
06:57 - writing lots of lines of code
06:59 - you have to store this code somewhere
07:01 - because you don't want to lose it this
07:02 - is where learning languages such as
07:04 - git or using just version control skills
07:07 - is gonna help you out because these are
07:08 - skills that are actually used out there
07:10 - in the real world so if you could use
07:12 - them now and learn them now
07:14 - it's just gonna beef up your portfolio
07:16 - and make you look a lot more impressive
07:18 - to any recruiter now i really want to
07:20 - emphasize this
07:21 - when i say build a project i don't just
07:24 - mean going on youtube and following a
07:26 - tutorial and just copying and pasting
07:27 - the code that you see there
07:29 - and having a project that works but you
07:31 - don't understand a single line of code
07:33 - i mean actually going out on your own
07:36 - implementing new features to a tutorial
07:39 - that you might have built or your own
07:40 - project
07:41 - and understanding the lines of code
07:43 - really seeing
07:44 - what something is doing knowing why it's
07:46 - doing something and how your project
07:48 - actually works because that is how
07:50 - you're actually going to learn
07:52 - not just by copying and pasting someone
07:53 - else's code and claiming it to be your
07:55 - own
07:56 - this video is brought to you by

10:06 - so once you've gone through this journey
10:09 - of becoming a master of your craft
10:12 - of really honing into becoming a full
10:14 - stack developer
10:15 - now comes the fun part this is the job
10:17 - hunt
10:18 - this is where you have to now use other
10:21 - skill sets
10:22 - and develop these other skill sets to
10:24 - actually land your job
10:25 - and become a full stack javascript
10:27 - developer so the quickest way to start
10:29 - off is the way that we all know and the
10:30 - way that everyone talks about which is
10:32 - simply
10:32 - you could start off with the resume if
10:34 - you had been properly building up your
10:36 - skills if you had been
10:37 - making these projects while mastering
10:39 - javascript and becoming a full stack
10:40 - developer
10:41 - you could start to leverage these
10:42 - projects and put them into your resume
10:45 - the crazy thing is you don't need to be
10:47 - a programmer and you don't need to have
10:48 - programming experience
10:50 - to land a job as a full stack javascript
10:52 - developer
10:53 - but you do need to have experience and
10:56 - that experience can be shown
10:57 - through the projects that you've already
10:59 - built to be able to learn these
11:00 - foundational skill sets so if you want
11:02 - to beef up your resume just a little bit
11:04 - more
11:04 - you can also make your online portfolio
11:06 - so what that would be is you
11:08 - buy a domain name that might be your
11:10 - full name or something that's available
11:12 - and they could put information about you
11:14 - you can have an about section you can
11:15 - have a projects and portfolios
11:17 - it can showcase all the things that
11:19 - you've been able to do
11:20 - this especially as a developer is a
11:22 - little bit better than the resume
11:24 - because it shows that you also
11:25 - understand how to build websites now to
11:28 - be honest
11:28 - you could build your own website or you
11:30 - can also just leverage
11:32 - other platforms to build your own
11:34 - website but here at cleverprogrammer our
11:36 - job is to take you
11:37 - above and beyond what the regular person
11:40 - is doing because that is what the
11:42 - regular software developer is doing to
11:44 - land a job i'm about to tell you what
11:45 - are these other extra bonus things that
11:47 - you could be doing to make sure
11:49 - you land your job as a full stack
11:51 - javascript developer
11:52 - so here is a little bonus that we're to
11:55 - give you
11:55 - if you want to really increase your
11:57 - marketability
11:58 - if you want to position yourself as an
12:00 - expert you need to start to build
12:03 - your own brand now you could do this in
12:06 - several different ways
12:07 - one way is on linkedin so linkedin is
12:10 - very cool because you get to connect
12:12 - with a lot of
12:13 - experts out in the field you could meet
12:15 - a lot of different recruiters and you
12:16 - can use
12:17 - a lot of different strategies to get
12:19 - your resume and your portfolio in front
12:20 - of recruiters
12:21 - that you wouldn't be able to if you just
12:23 - went into indeed.com and sent your
12:25 - resumes and your applications
12:27 - if you leverage these connections you'll
12:29 - be able to get in front of the right
12:30 - people
12:31 - and land your dream job as a full stack
12:34 - javascript
12:34 - developer now not only that linkedin is
12:37 - another social media platform
12:39 - so you can actually leverage it to post
12:42 - about
12:42 - your own journey and document your own
12:45 - journey
12:46 - as a software developer so think about
12:48 - this imagine you want to transition into
12:51 - software development
12:52 - where you want to land your first job if
12:54 - you start to talk about the projects
12:55 - that you're working on
12:56 - the things that you're learning and
12:58 - people start to interact with you you're
12:59 - gonna start to make some solid
13:01 - connections
13:01 - but if someone can go back and see your
13:04 - story it's gonna be more beneficial
13:06 - because the recruiter can see your
13:08 - journey they're gonna have more of a
13:09 - connection with you
13:10 - than if they just saw your resume so not
13:12 - only could you leverage linkedin we
13:14 - could also leverage other platforms such
13:15 - as
13:15 - instagram or even facebook but the idea
13:18 - is
13:19 - if you start to document your journey to
13:22 - becoming a full stack javascript
13:23 - developer
13:24 - and you start to show the world you're
13:26 - positioning yourself in a manner
13:28 - that will allow recruiters to get to
13:29 - know more of you and maybe they'll like
13:31 - your personality and they'll want to
13:32 - bring you in
13:33 - for an interview because let's be honest
13:35 - we've all grown to understand the
13:37 - importance of having an
13:39 - online presence because during a
13:41 - pandemic you just can't go out and meet
13:43 - new people
13:44 - so through having an online presence you
13:46 - can network
13:47 - with the right people and build the
13:49 - right connections that will only propel
13:51 - you throughout your career as a software
13:52 - developer so now
13:53 - let me drop another piece of advice here
13:57 - it's gonna be tough when you're going
13:59 - through this application process and
14:00 - here at cleverprogrammer
14:01 - we keep it serious i don't want to lie
14:03 - to you i want to be fully transparent
14:05 - with you
14:06 - it's a hard process when you start to
14:08 - apply but no one else is talking about
14:10 - this
14:10 - why because in reality it's going to be
14:13 - a numbers game
14:14 - when you're out there applying
14:15 - especially if you're getting a lot of
14:16 - rejection it might feel like you're just
14:18 - trying to say yes to the very first job
14:19 - so you can just become a software
14:21 - developer
14:22 - but you also want to make sure that
14:23 - you're interviewing the companies that
14:25 - are bringing you in for interviews
14:27 - because you want to make sure it's also
14:28 - going to be a great fit
14:30 - for you so this is going to be a numbers
14:32 - game you are going to be rejected a lot
14:34 - but let me tell you this
14:35 - if you consistently show up if you
14:38 - consistently
14:38 - submit applications if you're
14:40 - consistently networking
14:42 - with other software developers and other
14:44 - recruiters it's just a matter of time
14:47 - before you land your dream job as a full
14:49 - stack javascript developer so the
14:51 - process is tough
14:52 - but stick to the process keep reaching
14:54 - out keep networking
14:56 - keep sending applications keep those
14:58 - rejections coming
14:59 - because it only takes one job offer to
15:01 - change your life
15:02 - now one final tip by now you're out
15:05 - there
15:05 - you have an amazing linkedin profile
15:08 - you're networking
15:09 - you're making amazing connections you're
15:11 - putting out your journey to become and
15:13 - landing your first
15:14 - full stack software developer job you're
15:16 - playing you're getting rejected
15:18 - but you don't care because you know it's
15:19 - just a matter of time before you get
15:20 - accepted
15:21 - and now you're in the interview process
15:22 - you're getting interviewed by some
15:24 - companies
15:24 - and you might be having a difficult time
15:27 - and you might be having a hard time
15:28 - because some of these
15:29 - want you to do technical interviews and
15:31 - others don't
15:32 - well there's going to be two specific
15:34 - skills that you're going to want to
15:35 - build
15:36 - during this interview process phase but
15:37 - again i want to re-emphasize this you
15:40 - don't have to worry about this
15:41 - when you're applying to jobs you don't
15:44 - have to worry about this
15:45 - when you're learning about programming
15:47 - you only have to worry about the
15:48 - technical skill set
15:50 - when you've been getting interviews time
15:52 - and time again
15:53 - but you're not getting the job offer now
15:55 - you know that there's something you have
15:56 - to work on
15:57 - this is when you want to dive deeper
15:59 - into data structures and algorithms
16:02 - this is when you want to leverage things
16:03 - such as leak code
16:05 - or hacker rank and use these platforms
16:07 - so that you could develop those skill
16:09 - sets so when you show up to an interview
16:11 - and ask your technical question
16:12 - and you solve that technical question in
16:14 - the most optimal way
16:16 - possible then they're really going to
16:17 - want to bring you into the company but
16:19 - you don't have to worry about this
16:20 - until the bottleneck of you landing a
16:22 - job is
16:23 - the technical interviews now i said in
16:26 - interviewing there's two things you want
16:27 - to pay attention to
16:28 - the other thing is the soft skills or
16:30 - the behavioral questions
16:32 - honestly here is my biggest tip this is
16:34 - the tip that's allowed me to get
16:36 - job offers from blue origin microsoft
16:38 - and google when i showed up to the
16:39 - interviews
16:40 - instead of being nervous or instead of
16:42 - faking my confidence i just realized
16:44 - that the other person
16:45 - across the table or the other person now
16:48 - since a lot of the interviews are done
16:49 - virtually
16:50 - and the other side of the computer is
16:52 - just a human being
16:53 - when i was able to realize that i was
16:55 - able to just have that empathy that hey
16:57 - i'm here i might feel like i don't know
16:59 - what i'm doing but also in reality they
17:01 - don't know what they're doing
17:02 - no one knows what they're doing right
17:03 - when i went into interviews with this
17:05 - maybe ridiculous mindset it allowed me
17:08 - to be comfortable and it allowed me to
17:10 - connect with the other person
17:11 - when they were asking me questions they
17:13 - weren't going against me and trying to
17:15 - figure out what my flaws were
17:16 - in fact they were on my side they're
17:18 - trying to figure out what my strengths
17:20 - were so that they can showcase that and
17:22 - they could bring me into the company
17:23 - when i start to think of them and assume
17:25 - that they were my friends
17:26 - the minute i entered that room the
17:29 - conversations were completely different
17:31 - i wasn't robotic i was able to show up i
17:34 - was able to be charismatic i was able to
17:35 - drop in jokes here and there
17:37 - and i was able to connect with them as a
17:39 - human being
17:40 - and that was one of the biggest mindset
17:43 - shifts
17:43 - that allowed me to start to crush the
17:46 - soft skills
17:47 - or the behavioral questions when it came
17:49 - to interviewing now that was a big
17:51 - mindset shift for me but i also still
17:53 - had to make sure
17:54 - that i had basic human communication
17:56 - skills for example i had good eye
17:58 - contact
17:58 - i had good projection i had good manners
18:01 - i had good etiquette
18:02 - i also had to make sure i just had a
18:04 - regular human to human interaction
18:06 - skills for example
18:07 - i had good eye contact i had good voice
18:10 - projection
18:11 - i was able to ask intuitive and
18:13 - interesting questions and solve some
18:15 - problems they just wanted to know
18:17 - that i'm a normal person that you're a
18:19 - normal person because we're going to be
18:20 - working
18:21 - with them we're going to be a team
18:23 - member they want to make sure that if i
18:24 - was part of their team
18:26 - i had their back and just one more tip
18:28 - because this video is full of tips for
18:31 - you
18:31 - you can also prepare for behavioral
18:33 - questions a behavioral question is when
18:35 - they ask you hey
18:36 - in xyz situation that might be a very
18:39 - hard situation to deal with
18:41 - how would you react or they might ask
18:43 - you tell me about a time where
18:45 - x y z with these type of situations
18:48 - something you can do to prepare ahead of
18:50 - time is you can start to think of
18:52 - scenarios
18:53 - and specific stories that you want to
18:54 - tell for these questions
18:56 - i'm sure you've come across a tough
18:58 - situation
18:59 - where you had to make a decision between
19:02 - going this route or going that route
19:04 - and it was a dilemma because you really
19:05 - couldn't choose you want to think of
19:07 - that story and you want to think about
19:08 - how you can frame that story so it makes
19:11 - you look like the hero when you made a
19:13 - decision
19:14 - what did you learn what were the results
19:15 - of those things if you prep
19:18 - four to five different stories whenever
19:20 - they ask you one behavioral question
19:22 - you could probably go to your inventory
19:24 - stories pick one out
