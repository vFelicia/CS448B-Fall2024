03:27 - so let's import this let's simplify the
03:31 - journey
03:32 - of becoming a full stack developer guys
03:34 - okay oh i see people in the youtube chat
03:36 - it's amazing
03:37 - awesome let's simplify the journey to
03:38 - become first developer right the number
03:40 - one thing you need to think about okay
03:42 - is think about kind of the goal right
03:43 - the goal that you need to you know that
03:45 - you that you want right
03:46 - do you want so for example here uh maker
03:49 - okay uh marek
03:51 - what's your goal for example tell me
03:54 - what's your goal
03:56 - my goal is to you know just have more
03:59 - time okay so you want to have more time
04:01 - correct
04:02 - okay okay so that's your goal okay now
04:04 - so if you want to have more time what
04:06 - does it take to have more time tell me
04:09 - uh like i told you before uh it'll be
04:13 - freelancing
04:14 - just or or uh just working remotely
04:17 - having that more time to you know spend
04:19 - with family
04:21 - um understanding the the concept
04:24 - of javascript right really so you do
04:27 - this so
04:28 - your goal your goal is to have more time
04:30 - and with that you're
04:31 - obviously the thing that you do is like
04:33 - work remotely right so you want to work
04:34 - remotely
04:35 - and be a kind of uh as a as a full-stack
04:38 - developer might that be freelancing or
04:40 - might that be the job correct yes sir
04:43 - okay broker multi modelly as a full site
04:45 - developer right
04:46 - now let's talk about exactly right let's
04:48 - talk about the steps you need to do
04:50 - to actually get there so let's talk
04:51 - about steps okay so step one for example
04:53 - step one what does you need to do for
04:55 - step one think about this
04:58 - uh understand everything about
05:02 - javascript
05:03 - understand understand gis okay step two
05:06 - let's think about this
05:10 - practice practice practice practice
05:14 - that's huge right that's the big thing
05:16 - right practice practice practice okay
05:17 - okay
05:18 - let's go ahead and do step three okay
05:20 - here's my step three for you okay this
05:22 - is really important one listen up okay
05:23 - this is called
05:24 - problem solving okay i want you to
05:26 - practice not only that
05:27 - not just practice but you need to get
05:29 - good at problem solving marek okay
05:31 - but that's the most important thing
05:33 - problem solving okay
05:34 - step that's that's what you need to do
05:36 - right and that's because every
05:37 - programmer
05:38 - essentially is a problem solver you
05:40 - solve a complicated problem by
05:42 - writing software correct okay let's say
05:45 - i think about that step four
05:46 - step four i was thinking about this what
05:47 - do you think a step four is could be
05:51 - um
05:55 - clear.project yeah so build your
05:58 - portfolio so build your portfolio
05:59 - correct so build your portfolio correct
06:02 - okay portfolio portfolio right there
06:05 - build your portfolio
06:07 - right here okay right here for step
06:10 - three i'm gonna kind of go back to this
06:11 - and this is
06:12 - this right here is the most important
06:14 - just so you know right here this part
06:16 - csmarak this part right here is the most
06:20 - important okay problem solving
06:23 - if you can get this then you cannot
06:25 - build your portfolio
06:28 - if you cannot be a good problem solver
06:30 - your portfolio
06:31 - only it will look cool that's fine it's
06:33 - fake it's not
06:34 - real it's just tutorials you found that
06:36 - you happened to copy and you didn't
06:38 - really exactly exactly it's like let's
06:41 - say it's like having a
06:42 - i don't know a car that looks cool but
06:44 - drives shitty
06:45 - yeah yeah yeah it's it's like if you
06:47 - were to get the body of a tesla
06:48 - yeah and then you put it over like an
06:50 - old car it doesn't even work so you're
06:52 - like oh look i have this tesla
06:54 - but it doesn't even start right it's not
06:56 - even electric exactly exactly right so
06:58 - that's the most important thing okay
06:59 - okay step four now let's do step five
07:02 - okay
07:04 - step five is what step five what is step
07:06 - five
07:07 - step five
07:11 - i think step five is
07:15 - hmm start finding clients yeah apply
07:18 - apply to jobs or finding clients apply
07:20 - to jobs right slash find clients correct
07:24 - right now apply to remote jobs let's be
07:26 - clear about that remote because
07:28 - right you don't want to look for jobs
07:29 - that necessarily don't fit what you want
07:32 - right
07:32 - remote jobs or or find clients remote
07:34 - clients does that make sense
07:36 - right so we want to be very direct with
07:38 - that comprende
07:41 - comprende is good okay cool but here's
07:43 - my biggest question though marek
07:45 - okay here's my and this is to everybody
07:47 - here literally to
07:48 - everybody here here's my big question to
07:51 - you okay
07:52 - is you said that yes you have to do all
07:55 - these different things right
07:56 - great i have to do all this i have to
07:59 - understand yes i have to
08:00 - practice practice okay i have to be a
08:03 - problem solver and build your portfolio
08:05 - and apply to remote jobs but there's one
08:07 - big
08:08 - [ __ ] question that we need to ask
08:10 - ourselves
08:12 - and that is very simple
08:15 - here's a question wait
08:19 - who do i
08:23 - need to be
08:26 - whoa that's a big question
08:31 - who do i need to be
08:34 - to do all these things that i want to do
08:39 - right
08:41 - who do i need to be to be to be a
08:44 - promise all right
08:46 - who do i need to be to be able to apply
08:48 - for remote jobs and find a foster
08:50 - developer job
08:51 - okay that is the question who do i need
08:54 - to be
08:55 - so who do you need to be marek okay
08:59 - in order in order
09:02 - to become a full stack developer tell me
09:09 - what do you think it is huh
09:13 - bulldog mindset okay mentally strong
09:16 - okay but let's go let's go deeper into
09:18 - this though
09:19 - let's go deeper now what else you have
09:22 - to be a student
09:24 - okay so student but okay now but before
09:26 - that okay that's fine but that's not
09:28 - totally where i'm going at where what
09:30 - else
09:33 - seems like maybe to you know figure out
09:36 - solutions to
09:37 - people's problems um that's not what i'm
09:39 - trying to try and look for here
09:41 - determine determine who said that
09:47 - yeah determined you need to be
09:50 - determined
09:51 - you need to be mad persistent
09:57 - you need to be so [ __ ] persistent
10:02 - that whatever difficulty that comes in
10:04 - front of you
10:06 - you can go through it
10:11 - because here's what's gonna happen at
10:12 - some point marek it's what happens to
10:14 - everybody
10:16 - you have a challenge you have a
10:18 - challenge that's in front of you
10:20 - and it's gonna get [ __ ] hard
10:24 - okay you have a child that's in front of
10:27 - you
10:28 - and you're gonna be like oh [ __ ] i can't
10:29 - do it i can't figure it out
10:31 - and then here's what a lot of people do
10:33 - they quit
10:43 - this is what a lot of people do
10:47 - i had a student recently he is in our
10:49 - coding bootcamp right now which is the
10:50 - buddha
10:50 - we'll be talking about later on he got
10:53 - an internship
10:54 - as a reaction developer but it was hard
10:56 - for him he couldn't it was like really
10:58 - hard for him right
10:59 - it's just his first censorship right
11:01 - he's like nahs it's so hard i know i
11:03 - feel like a quitting
11:04 - i'm like what the [ __ ] did you just say
11:10 - you got an opportunity in front of you
11:11 - and gonna quit because it's hard
11:14 - nothing in the [ __ ] this life is
11:15 - supposed to be easy
11:17 - especially when it's very rewarding
11:19 - things there's a saying that says
11:20 - there's a saying that says nothing
11:22 - nothing
11:23 - worth having comes easy
11:32 - understand truth to that
11:36 - truth to that
11:39 - so this is what i want you to do right
11:41 - is you have to think about who do i need
11:42 - to be i need to be someone
11:44 - wakes up wakes up early in the morning
11:50 - in the morning maybe i'm not sure
11:51 - depending how you work i need to be
11:53 - someone
11:54 - who potentially may be right maybe
11:56 - someone you want to you need to be
11:57 - someone who
11:58 - is i don't know you need to you i want
12:00 - to uh you guys
12:01 - the the what's your call that youtube
12:03 - can't really see because there's a thing
12:04 - right there
12:05 - i need to be someone who maybe it codes
12:07 - every day
12:08 - non-stop codes every day no matter what
12:11 - right
12:12 - this is what we have to ask us about
12:13 - these important questions is who they
12:15 - need to because i can i can talk a big
12:16 - game i can talk a big game of like okay
12:18 - cool well i want to be false a developer
12:21 - i need to learn js i need to be a
12:22 - problem solver but great
12:24 - but unless you put some [ __ ] work and
12:26 - some action actual words behind it
12:29 - that means [ __ ] nothing
12:34 - do you understand oh yeah
12:39 - that's what you what i want you guys to
12:40 - think about
12:42 - okay who do i need to be everybody right
12:45 - now in the zoom call
12:46 - if you are currently on for example if
12:49 - you're currently on youtube
12:50 - write this down a piece of paper who do
12:52 - you need to be who do i
12:54 - need to be who do you need to be daniel
12:58 - i need to be someone that
13:01 - has all these words that's not just put
13:03 - up there
13:06 - but to be able to get to there i also
13:10 - recognize i need to set some goals
13:12 - and get there little by little and
13:13 - that's why we're going back to setting
13:15 - goals because there's two
13:16 - types of goals that are going to get
13:18 - there right was nas just talked about
13:20 - is that is gonna be part of your
13:21 - long-term vision who do i need to be you
13:23 - have that long-term vision of yourself
13:25 - five years from now
13:26 - ten years from now but to get to that
13:28 - point you have to break that down into
13:30 - smaller
13:31 - and shorter goals so that you could
13:34 - start to baby step your way
13:36 - or if you're going to go hard you start
13:38 - to sprint your way
13:40 - to becoming that person exactly as long
13:42 - as there's progress
13:43 - you know it's up to you whether you're
13:44 - going to go fast or slow but as long as
13:45 - the progress so what does a long-term
13:47 - goal look like
13:48 - noz so let's say a long-term goal of
13:49 - course is you we want to be let's say in
13:51 - my
13:52 - in mark's size for example um
13:55 - right his goal is for them for example
13:57 - to become a false developer because he
13:58 - wants to be able to work remotely so he
14:00 - that he can have
14:01 - more time with his family okay so that
14:03 - is one of his long-term goals okay
14:05 - um now or either that our first
14:08 - developer or
14:08 - full stack freelancer either either case
14:10 - works correct
14:11 - right either case right cool now okay so
14:15 - that's your long-term goal okay
14:16 - that could be one year five years maybe
14:18 - six months who knows okay
14:20 - but now okay now what is our short-term
14:23 - goal
14:23 - well here's our short-term goal okay we
14:26 - want to for example learn the
14:27 - fundamentals
14:28 - we want to learn javascript and react we
14:31 - want to for example for example let me
14:33 - go ahead and look at this
14:34 - for example you want to go ahead and uh
14:37 - you know build builder build our build
14:39 - your portfolio build
14:40 - build our first our first react.js
14:44 - project react.js project
14:47 - project from a tutorial for example
14:49 - right so maybe you start out number one
14:51 - is you start out for example building a
14:52 - project from your portfolio from like a
14:54 - youtube tutorial or something
14:55 - something like that there's nothing
14:57 - wrong with that it's a way to introduce
14:58 - yourself to it
15:00 - the problem becomes later on is when
15:03 - you're long
15:04 - when your short term goal becomes this
15:08 - project from tutorials all the time
15:13 - this is when it becomes a problem this
15:16 - is something called
15:17 - tutorial health and you can't get out of
15:20 - tutorial hell
15:21 - if you just keep doing more tutorials
15:23 - all the time you need to do the opposite
15:25 - of tutorials if you're trying to get out
15:26 - tutorials exactly
15:27 - so what do you need to do daniel to get
15:28 - out of tutorial hell
15:30 - you need to make sure you understand how
15:33 - to actually write code and solve
15:35 - problems because at that point you can
15:37 - start to build your own software
15:39 - yes so for example let's go let's go
15:42 - just put down some a few things that for
15:43 - example we can learn for example
15:45 - so let's go number one okay
15:49 - so build your build your own project
15:50 - from scratch yeah so
15:52 - here here's you it could be from scratch
15:54 - or you could build on top of a tutorial
15:56 - that you've already built
15:57 - because if you follow tutorial maybe you
15:59 - could follow along
16:00 - and you can add a feature to it you can
16:03 - add something else that you didn't
16:04 - follow anyone's tutorial you yourself
16:06 - you were able to come up with that
16:07 - correct correct
16:08 - so for example let me ask this question
16:10 - marek have you completed any of the
16:12 - modules in uh
16:13 - in pwg right now yes i'm on
16:17 - modules six or seven right now okay six
16:20 - or seven okay
16:21 - so what project have you built so far
16:24 - uh by myself i haven't built any
16:27 - projects for myself i've just been going
16:28 - through this no no no no
16:30 - what project have you built from the
16:32 - tutorial
16:33 - oh uh i'm gonna look it up give me a
16:37 - second
16:39 - i'm guessing for example guess the
16:40 - number game right right or you guessed
16:41 - the number again yeah
16:42 - the guess the number game yeah so let's
16:45 - think about this so you have this one
16:47 - righteous number game right gabe
16:48 - all right have you built the weather app
16:51 - yet or no
16:51 - the weather app yes i built it already
16:53 - let's think about the weather app okay
16:55 - okay weather app okay let's think about
16:58 - okay
16:59 - what additional features can you add by
17:02 - yourself
17:03 - as a way to learn better and faster
17:06 - okay let's think about this okay what
17:08 - additional features can you add
17:10 - anybody having suggestions in the you on
17:12 - youtube if you're on youtube right
17:14 - okay provided some suggestions on
17:16 - youtube if you're here in a zoom
17:18 - what suggestions go ahead and raise your
17:19 - hand and talk what suggestion would you
17:21 - have for marek for example
17:23 - to you know to go ahead and uh what's it
17:25 - called and uh to build new features what
17:27 - do you guys think
17:28 - trey what do you think
17:32 - trey you hear me
17:35 - yeah i can hear you okay
17:38 - um you could add like
17:42 - um centralized like your location
17:45 - um specifically or you could throw in
17:48 - some extra
17:49 - [Music]
17:50 - designs like uh your
17:55 - make it look like you want to you know
17:57 - yeah yeah so extra design aspects right
18:00 - right maybe for example i think a google
18:03 - might be for example
18:04 - um like find your location
18:08 - your location based on ip address
18:11 - yeah so for example you might not even
18:13 - have to for example
18:14 - you know ask the person for their
18:16 - location it's just it finds
18:18 - automatically
18:19 - based on your ip address and that's
18:20 - possible in coding right so find your
18:22 - location based on a p address
18:24 - because for example when you go by when
18:25 - you go to weather channel or some other
18:27 - weather
18:28 - like a company they will actually get
18:31 - you
18:31 - the you know the weather based on your
18:33 - iphone that's that's so simple right
18:38 - right anything else for example let's
18:40 - say claudio or anybody else
18:41 - anybody else have any suggestions
18:47 - um sorry i don't even remember the
18:51 - weather no but think about it yourself
18:53 - right just think about where you're for
18:54 - yourself right what kind
19:01 - [Music]
19:05 - they need multiple days
19:08 - of water yeah oh yeah yeah i like that
19:10 - so like multiple days of weather correct
19:14 - um also
19:17 - [Music]
19:18 - after yeah multiple information
19:23 - here because the weather is also not
19:26 - only
19:26 - sun or rainy but humidity
19:29 - yeah and all of our stuff yeah yeah for
19:32 - sure for sure for sure
19:34 - so you can see yeah so that's what your
19:35 - goal is your goal should be to
19:37 - build on top of the current projects
19:38 - does everybody understand here raise
19:40 - your hand
19:41 - raise your hand yes yes yes yes yes good
19:43 - good good right
19:44 - everybody should be building that you
19:46 - should not just be copying from a
19:48 - tutorial and that's pretty much
19:49 - it so just keep that in mind every
19:52 - single time you're doing tutorial may
19:53 - that be from us
19:55 - may that be from a different course
19:57 - might that be from youtube
19:58 - it don't matter
20:01 - we have a lot of students right now i'm
20:03 - not kidding a lot of students right now
20:04 - who are going through for example
20:06 - just youtube tutorials and you know what
20:08 - they can't [ __ ] build [ __ ]
20:11 - i'm sorry that's the [ __ ] the truth
20:15 - you can't build [ __ ] and you want if you
20:17 - can't build [ __ ] you won't get a job
20:20 - i know i'm like being very pumped up
20:22 - right now but it's like you know there's
20:23 - a reason
20:25 - okay that's the only way that's the only
20:27 - way for me to
20:28 - communicate this kind of stuff for you
20:29 - right now so cool does that make sense
20:31 - for everybody yes or no
20:32 - yes that's our short-term goal okay okay
20:35 - and again
20:36 - make sure you you write this stuff down
20:37 - guys make sure you write this stuff down
20:39 - okay
20:39 - and and take your time right like that's
20:40 - where nas is here stopping
20:43 - putting you in this position so that you
20:45 - could take your time
20:46 - write this stuff down you really think
20:48 - it through like what are the steps that
20:49 - we have to take the short terms and how
20:50 - they're going to add up to be able to
20:52 - get to that long term
20:53 - goal in the end yes exactly exactly
20:55 - exactly awesome sweet
20:57 - so make a plan okay cool next up let's
20:58 - go ahead and see
21:00 - okay next up so to be able to write it
21:03 - down you could use notion
21:05 - yeah notion use wherever you want
21:06 - whatever you love notes whatever it
21:07 - might be
21:08 - in notes app yeah for example so again
21:11 - write down is very important for example
21:12 - here
21:13 - a neuroscientist here explains that i'm
21:15 - going to remove this stuff
21:17 - right people who very vividly describe
21:19 - or picture their goals are anywhere from
21:21 - 1.2 to 1.4 times more likely to
21:24 - successfully accomplish their goals it's
21:25 - actually really funny i always like
21:27 - i always like picture by myself i always
21:29 - picture like for example
21:31 - us the color programmer team like on
21:32 - stage for example
21:34 - like given a talk presentation on at a
21:36 - conference where we introduce for
21:37 - example like
21:38 - a bootcamp or introduce a program or not
21:41 - just introduce but just like
21:42 - provide value you know or we have
21:44 - speakers i i picture this like every
21:46 - single time i do meditation
21:47 - right i picture myself for example
21:49 - getting a tesla at some point for
21:51 - example right hey
21:53 - guys you see that's what happens when
21:54 - you visualize when you vividly describe
21:56 - that picture in that goal
21:58 - you achieve it now this is a prime
22:00 - example of that next we'll be talking on
22:02 - stage just like how he's talking about
22:03 - right now yeah we will i'm not kidding
22:05 - that's going to happen at the end this
22:06 - year yes
22:06 - it's going to happen right so it's stuff
22:09 - like this like for example next up you
22:11 - have for example these people say that
22:12 - a few fewer than 20 percent of people
22:14 - report reported that they described
22:16 - their goals and reform which is on which
22:18 - it just just which is unfortunate as
22:20 - humans we process visuals
22:22 - 60 times faster than having to imagine
22:24 - things based on a recent study about the
22:26 - 3m company
22:27 - so writing down your goals means that
22:29 - you can visualize
22:30 - visually see them this is an important
22:32 - point because when we see something
22:34 - right
22:35 - it affects how we act wow that's
22:37 - powerful that's pretty cool and that's
22:38 - why people have vision boards as well
22:40 - right yeah people can set up a board
22:41 - where they just put pictures of
22:42 - the things that they want and that
22:44 - visual cue helps them to take the right
22:46 - action
22:47 - yes 100 percent have a 100 and actually
22:49 - visual board
22:50 - is actually really cool something that
22:51 - aaron my friend does he has a visual
22:52 - board literally
22:53 - literally create a visual board guys is
22:55 - really really cool
22:57 - create a visual board a vision board a
22:59 - vision board
23:00 - of everything that you want for example
23:02 - to have in your life for example right
23:04 - and honestly and just make it a
23:07 - screensaver
23:08 - or make it a your full desktop picture
23:10 - now personally i don't do this myself
23:12 - right now
23:13 - but i have my friend aaron who is going
23:15 - through big transformation right now and
23:16 - he has that fully like there right there
23:18 - in front of him
23:19 - on not only for example on you know not
23:22 - not only for example for
23:24 - on his desktop but also like for example
23:26 - on his iphone
23:27 - it's pretty insane yeah so everywhere
23:29 - that he's just constantly there
23:30 - he gets that reminder that visual and he
23:33 - could start to work towards that so
23:34 - that's why it's important guys to
23:36 - be able to write this down so you can
23:37 - visualize it because literally people
23:39 - are able to have more success
23:41 - the more ingrained in their mind it
23:42 - becomes and the more it becomes part of
23:44 - their
23:44 - specific identity for sure for sure
23:48 - awesome okay
23:48 - let's go and keep going that case
23:50 - [Music]
23:52 - next slide next slide let's see okay
23:55 - what does it take to become a successful
23:57 - star developer that's a good question so
23:59 - let's talk about the technical skills
24:01 - that you need to know
24:02 - to to get there all right so part one
24:05 - technology to know to become a full
24:08 - stack developer right here guys all
24:09 - right well let me see
24:11 - you know html css right here right
24:14 - uh javascript right here of course very
24:16 - important
24:17 - uh react gs is going to be the the
24:20 - framework of our choice
24:22 - sorry the library of our choice
24:24 - sometimes some people get really really
24:25 - picky about this kind of stuff
24:27 - no gs gonna be a great choice for the
24:29 - back end uh there's also
24:31 - you know you can also do django as well
24:32 - so jingle is another great choice
24:34 - uh as well let's go ahead and keep going
24:36 - uh next we have
24:38 - firebase another great database exactly
24:40 - to play around with
24:41 - mongodb is an amazing database as well
24:43 - to use an express gs
24:45 - that's going to go hand in hand with
24:47 - node.js
24:48 - right here and of course the really
24:50 - important
24:51 - my sequel guys
24:55 - guys guys make sure that if you don't
24:57 - know these take a screenshot right now
24:59 - take a screenshot
25:00 - of this because you're gonna be able to
25:01 - realize and have this even as your
25:03 - vision board these could be the things
25:04 - that you want to master because the
25:05 - first thing will set your goals
25:06 - the next thing is what are the things
25:08 - that you have to master to become a full
25:09 - stack developer
25:10 - this is it i mean you could definitely
25:13 - trade some things
25:14 - in and out but if you do this you can
25:15 - become that full stack developer
25:17 - exactly exactly exactly so cool now guys
25:20 - again i mentioned like my sequel
25:22 - this kind of stuff is really really
25:23 - important uh i still this is something
25:25 - we teach very much
25:26 - in the boot camp we have and of course
25:29 - there's more technologies
25:30 - to us right like you cannot so
25:33 - so forget about everything because we
25:35 - are going to literally start
25:37 - and tell you from scratch the real
25:39 - reality of becoming a
25:41 - full stack developer and what you need
25:43 - to know right because first off
25:44 - we need to be honest with you right yes
25:46 - becoming a full stack developer
25:48 - isn't something that just happened i'm
25:49 - sorry i can't in days or a month or two
25:52 - it takes time no it takes practice it
25:54 - takes persistence
25:55 - it takes everything that nods was
25:57 - talking about earlier
25:58 - yes and it's like a lot of people they
26:00 - will come into this kind of stuff right
26:01 - guys they'll come in and they'll be like
26:03 - okay well you know i want to be a foster
26:05 - developer
26:06 - and i want to be in two months and i
26:08 - want to be a [ __ ] millionaire
26:11 - no like who wants to be a millionaire
26:13 - here huh guys tell me
26:15 - who wants to be a millionaire here raise
26:16 - your hand i mean everybody should raise
26:17 - their hand if they want to
26:19 - but are you thinking but you think
26:20 - you'll be there next month or two
26:22 - um take take some time unless you win
26:25 - the [ __ ] lottery
26:26 - true unless you know some crazy thing
26:28 - happens then
26:29 - yeah probably not a lot of stuff takes a
26:32 - lot of time takes a lot of work guys
26:34 - it takes persistence but most
26:36 - importantly what i want to tell you guys
26:37 - to do is
26:38 - please when you get into coding this is
26:40 - for everybody
26:41 - for you on youtube because i'm so
26:43 - passionate about this right
26:44 - for you that are currently here on zoom
26:47 - you guys
26:47 - please please please listen to this okay
26:50 - don't don't do this
26:54 - just for the money please
26:58 - too many people go into this issue they
27:01 - do it just for the money right
27:03 - they go home they're like oh i wanna i
27:04 - want the money that's all i want no
27:06 - this this [ __ ] is hard and so this will
27:08 - require a different level understanding
27:11 - right different understanding you
27:12 - actually want to do it because okay well
27:14 - because i want to be a developer i want
27:17 - to have this career right
27:19 - because i enjoy this i enjoy
27:22 - this exactly because here at clever
27:25 - programmer
27:26 - we don't make sad rich developers we
27:28 - make happy rich developers
27:31 - and we want you to be happy right so
27:34 - make sure you're doing this
27:35 - for the right reason so everyone here on

27:41 - on everybody you're passionate about
27:43 - that
27:44 - good good good good that's awesome the
27:46 - next step
27:47 - is once you admit you want to do this
27:50 - for the right reasons
27:51 - you have to start to create a time
27:53 - timeline okay exactly
27:55 - right let's let's think about this okay
27:57 - for those of you who has the busiest
27:59 - schedule right now raise your hand who
28:00 - is it who has a busy really busy
28:01 - schedule
28:02 - no put it down there me and others are
28:04 - busy
28:06 - yeah i mean we're very busy but we we
28:08 - still find time it's okay
28:09 - okay who has a very busy schedule tell
28:11 - me
28:12 - anybody okay cool so let's talk someone
28:14 - else for example uh
28:16 - let's take i know rishi you you code as
28:19 - well
28:19 - you code already so it's okay
28:20 - [Music]
28:23 - let's see but for example like uh
28:28 - elliot okay elliot okay what time from
28:31 - what time do you work
28:33 - elliot tell me so i i'm signed up
28:36 - mandatory for 40 hours a week it's
28:39 - really a nine to five but like it varies
28:41 - like some days will be nine to five
28:43 - some days are one to nine but i'm
28:45 - obligated to meet 40 hours a week
28:48 - so current job 40 hours a week
28:51 - how much time do you sleep uh
28:55 - i at least get five to six hours okay so
28:57 - five stars per week so that's for
28:58 - example
28:59 - let's say in seven days five to six
29:01 - hours that's what
29:03 - wait you get five to six hours only yo
29:05 - you need to sleep more the [ __ ] man you
29:06 - can save more time
29:09 - i just realized that what go to sleep
29:10 - bro go to [ __ ] sleep man
29:14 - yeah let's say let's say seven hours per
29:15 - week at least seven hours per week okay
29:17 - oh not per week per day
29:18 - per day okay that'd be 50 hours a week
29:20 - that'd be 50 hours a week okay so let's
29:22 - say 50 hours a week okay
29:26 - thanks david
29:29 - what did you say david do not [ __ ]
29:30 - support that david
29:32 - i don't see the chat there five hours is
29:34 - enough no no no
29:36 - no no no no no no no no no no no no
29:40 - that's why david sucks at programming
29:41 - because he only sleeps five hours
29:45 - oh
29:46 - [Music]
29:48 - no no no he's great but he could be
29:50 - better if he were to sleep himself
29:53 - let's say it's for the upper okay now
29:54 - how many d how many hours do we have in
29:57 - the weeks in general let's say it's what
29:58 - 24 times what is 24 times 7 100
30:02 - we have we have in general 168 68 hours
30:05 - per week
30:07 - so you have 50 50 hours so you're
30:09 - currently spending 90 hours
30:12 - 90 hours okay okay how much time you got
30:16 - left
30:17 - let's see once you see minus 90. you
30:20 - still have
30:21 - 78 hours to do all the other [ __ ]
30:24 - that you want to do
30:25 - that's a lot for a week bro
30:30 - now yes some of that yes sunday is new
30:32 - eating
30:33 - yeah eating that let's say okay 10 hours
30:35 - eating let's say 10 hours to go you know
30:37 - the bathroom you know who knows maybe
30:38 - you know to go to the bathroom for 10
30:39 - hours per week you know who knows
30:41 - right okay but let's say that leaves you
30:43 - off with 50 hours okay
30:45 - [ __ ] unless it leaves you up with 40
30:47 - hours and and
30:48 - hold up the 40 hours is a pretty real
30:50 - standard because there's people that
30:51 - literally have their full-time job
30:53 - full-time and they work 80 to 100 hours
30:56 - a week
30:56 - yes you know yes so obviously yeah it's
30:58 - definitely not like the best situation
31:01 - but if they're able to do that then that
31:02 - means the average human at least has an
31:04 - extra 40 hours a week
31:06 - yeah if they're working 40 hours a week
31:07 - exactly whatever they want to do yeah
31:09 - and you still
31:10 - still yes you know having taking a break
31:12 - is still fine you know taking some time
31:13 - off is still fine there's no problem
31:14 - with that
31:15 - i don't we don't try to push you like
31:17 - you have to work eight hours a week
31:18 - that's not the case here
31:19 - but what i want you guys to do is to
31:21 - find at least at least
31:22 - right at least 30 20 hours per week
31:25 - right now
31:26 - 20 to 30 hours right now 30 hours of
31:28 - work
31:30 - of coding hours per week like can
31:33 - everybody here dedicate at least 20-30
31:35 - hours per week of coding
31:37 - raise your hand raise your hand can you
31:41 - can you no not everybody so you guys
31:45 - can't
31:46 - okay good good good everybody yes right
31:48 - but of course you don't [ __ ] do it
31:54 - why because you're too comfortable
31:59 - no i don't know why honestly sometimes
32:01 - it's a it's just that you have to be
32:02 - more disciplined right this is
32:03 - it goes back to right it goes back to
32:06 - you know
32:06 - who do i need to be right and that goes
32:08 - back to well i just need to be more
32:10 - disciplined that's part one
32:11 - i need more discipline with my time so
32:13 - for example okay
32:14 - let's say that okay elliot when you when
32:16 - you get back from work
32:20 - um i mean for instance just say five
32:22 - o'clock so that's
32:23 - five o'clock so is it true that maybe
32:24 - between six and eight you can always
32:26 - dedicate six
32:26 - and eight or between five to seven or
32:28 - five to eight you can dedicate time
32:30 - for for this for uh for coding yeah
32:33 - there you go
32:33 - so that's already three hours per day
32:35 - right three hours per day
32:37 - times that by that size five that's
32:39 - already 15 hours per day
32:40 - and you give it one more for example you
32:43 - know one more uh one more day that's a
32:45 - saturday that's what you're already
32:46 - doing 20 hours 20 hours
32:48 - 20 hours per day or per week
32:51 - of coding now would you say this will
32:53 - take you a lot faster towards your goal
32:55 - become a developer
32:56 - right if you did that versus for example
32:58 - you know maybe like doing one hour per
33:00 - week or two would you agree plan down
33:02 - right
33:02 - it's pretty simple solution right right
33:04 - self-explanatory so this is what i want
33:06 - you guys to think about right
33:07 - very be very disciplined about your time
33:10 - use a calendar for example calendly is a
33:12 - really there's a something called
33:13 - calendar five
33:15 - calendar five this is on the app store
33:17 - right here
33:18 - saw calendar five right there such a
33:21 - cool calendar guys it's insane
33:23 - right very very very very very good so
33:26 - check to check that one out
33:29 - okay cool let's move on all right what
33:31 - do we have what does the big picture
33:33 - timeline look like again bringing it
33:34 - back to becoming
33:35 - a full stack developer what are the
33:37 - things that you have to do
33:39 - how can you start to structure
33:41 - everything so that you can make sure you
33:42 - can actually get there within 2021
33:44 - becoming the full stack developer well
33:46 - yeah
33:47 - yes so the first part we're going to go
33:48 - is the fundamentals
33:50 - this part do not [ __ ] miss this part
33:52 - right here guys
33:53 - this is what nobody does this is why
33:56 - everybody's struggling so much
33:57 - it's because of the fundamentals yeah
33:59 - even other boot camps like
34:00 - we've talked to other students who have
34:02 - been part of other boot camps
34:04 - and they don't even know how to build an
34:06 - application from scratch because they
34:08 - never learned the fundamentals they
34:09 - wouldn't know how to add a feature to
34:10 - anything because
34:12 - what they just went through was they
34:13 - just went through the course they just
34:14 - went through the tutorials and
34:15 - did whatever they were told so we
34:18 - realized that wow this is a huge gap and
34:20 - people's
34:20 - knowledge when they're trying to become
34:22 - a full site developer so we actually
34:24 - prioritize this and put it in the very
34:26 - beginning
34:27 - yes okay month two let's say for example
34:29 - or
34:30 - mother one because we're such cool
34:32 - because we're you know because we're you
34:33 - know
34:33 - we're programmers we start with this we
34:35 - go into like html css so maybe you take
34:37 - a break a little bit from coding and
34:38 - this
34:39 - takes you more into the creative side
34:40 - right which is to be able to develop
34:42 - beautiful websites beautiful
34:44 - applications just understand
34:46 - understand more so like the the view
34:49 - part of it right the view part of not
34:50 - the back end part of it but the view
34:51 - part of it okay
34:52 - in reality html and css they're not
34:55 - necessarily like programming languages
34:56 - they're what market languages or
34:57 - whatever they're called exactly
34:58 - so it'll kind of take your brain off of
35:01 - the programming you could see how to
35:02 - make beautiful websites and then
35:04 - give you that space to kind of go back
35:06 - into it with month
35:08 - two or month three whatever we're we'll
35:10 - keep it
35:11 - this way so month two it's not gonna use
35:12 - anything right there so next time your
35:14 - mouth to learn
35:15 - yes es6 then we have for example after
35:17 - you've kind of mastered a little bit
35:18 - more of javascript maybe you built a
35:19 - project here maybe at this point you
35:21 - built like a project let's say
35:22 - maybe you built a project at this point
35:24 - right okay
35:26 - after that point which which you do for
35:27 - example is you will for example maybe
35:29 - you might learn for example like
35:30 - react.js and this point right here right
35:32 - you might learn react.js
35:34 - and then finally you will go ahead and
35:35 - maybe you might then build a portfolio
35:38 - with your projects right right with the
35:40 - parts that you build so maybe you built
35:41 - the project with reactgs here
35:42 - but the project here that now gives you
35:44 - two projects they have another one here
35:46 - that's
35:46 - with you know with react.js right here
35:48 - that's pretty much it okay
35:49 - and then we for example then you keep
35:51 - doing practice problems so you've been
35:53 - doing
35:53 - fundamentals practice problems then you
35:56 - keep doing it
35:57 - on and on and on again and again and
35:59 - again
36:00 - okay you don't stop that for those of
36:03 - you right now who are just getting into
36:04 - software development okay
36:06 - do not make the mistake of for example
36:08 - don't not doing
36:09 - practice problems not doing algorithms
36:11 - so use things
36:12 - like hacker rank okay use things like
36:16 - lead code right all these different all
36:18 - these different solutions right
36:20 - are going to be a really great way for
36:22 - you to practice and you should be doing
36:23 - at least
36:24 - once one a week yes and guys this isn't
36:26 - like your history class
36:28 - back in high school where you just
36:30 - memorize something for one class
36:32 - you could forget it for the rest of your
36:33 - life these are things that you're just
36:35 - gonna have to revisit time and time
36:36 - again as you become a developer and
36:38 - that's what we're saying just keep
36:39 - practicing it's not like you'll learn it
36:40 - and you're done it's
36:41 - learn it and keep on learning it keep
36:43 - improving and keep practicing it and
36:44 - keep making it better because after that
36:46 - once you've gotten to that point you're
36:48 - going to do the same thing you're just
36:49 - going to keep applying
36:51 - four jobs yeah and now guys i do want to
36:54 - say
36:55 - for those of you who felt like maybe the
36:57 - 20 hours a week
36:58 - wasn't something that is not doable this
37:01 - is the tip
37:02 - for you guys you could still find 30
37:05 - minutes to one hour day so
37:07 - for those of you who didn't raise your
37:08 - hand when nas asked do you have 20 to 30
37:10 - hours a week to dedicate to programming
37:12 - my question to you is
37:13 - do you have five to seven hours a week
37:16 - to dedicate to programming yes and also
37:19 - if the answer is still no then you're
37:20 - just not serious about it
37:21 - exactly it's as simple as that guys
37:23 - because anyone can find
37:24 - five times anybody hours in a week i
37:26 - don't care how busy you are
37:27 - you could find five to seven hours a
37:29 - week yes to put
37:30 - into building your dreams yes so guys
37:34 - okay okay i want to kind of go because
37:36 - we're going to go to this really quickly
37:37 - at this point but
37:38 - i want to go over a little bit of
37:39 - fundamental side because i want to give
37:40 - you some really really good value here
37:42 - fundamentals portion here okay
37:44 - these fundamentals okay when i say
37:45 - fundamentals what the [ __ ] are those
37:47 - what are fundamentals let's let's go to
37:48 - this really quickly
37:49 - with me so fundamentals what are the
37:52 - things that need to lower fundamentals
37:53 - here david
37:54 - not david daniel tell me yeah not david
37:56 - daniels better
37:57 - well a fundamental could be something as
37:59 - simple as
38:00 - how do i even do a data structure i was
38:03 - going to go function but you start
38:04 - typing data structure
38:07 - i love that so before i get into data
38:08 - structure like how do i even write a
38:09 - function how do i even
38:11 - create classes and call other classes
38:13 - and do
38:14 - basic stuff when it comes to
38:16 - object-oriented programming
38:17 - right yes writing class creating all
38:20 - that good stuff
38:21 - now from there i think the next
38:23 - fundamentals you want to make sure you
38:24 - understand are just
38:25 - different types of data structures right
38:27 - other than just an array other than just
38:29 - a dictionary or an object in javascript
38:32 - what is a linked list what is a stack
38:34 - what is a queue what's a graph what's a
38:35 - tree
38:36 - what are all these different data
38:37 - structures that you can do right so all
38:39 - those would fall into data structures
38:41 - the reason is they're just different
38:43 - ways of
38:44 - storing data different structures in
38:46 - which you can store data that's why
38:48 - they're called data structures yeah yeah
38:49 - yeah yeah
38:50 - so linked lists cues trees for example
38:53 - all the graphs
38:54 - stacks right stacks okay graphs
38:57 - right stacks okay i'll say graphs
39:01 - right all of these are structures that
39:03 - you need to know
39:04 - and please please please do not wait
39:07 - till the end of your learning
39:09 - uh opportunity of your learning kind of
39:11 - journey to
39:13 - don't wait until the end to when you
39:15 - start interviewing
39:16 - then you start learning cues no that's
39:18 - not a good way you should be starting
39:19 - learning right now like
39:21 - right [ __ ] now when you get off this
39:23 - call everybody right now
39:25 - should start learning all these
39:27 - fundamentals linked lists
39:28 - cues trees because these ones they build
39:31 - what
39:31 - they build something called a
39:32 - problem-solving mind guide
39:34 - guys problem solving mind this is what i
39:38 - like to think about okay
39:39 - a problem-solving mind that's the whole
39:40 - goal that that they teach you okay
39:43 - because like if you understand okay for
39:44 - example right if you can for example
39:46 - here
39:46 - it's just an example here okay i have
39:48 - this for example
39:50 - you know this array of things right well
39:52 - okay let's think about this okay
39:54 - let's think about the if i have okay um
39:57 - let me do this oh no
40:00 - w here so let's think about this let's
40:03 - say i have
40:04 - a um well
40:08 - okay here's how about this you you know
40:10 - how you guys have
40:11 - search or what is this oh this is okay
40:13 - that's an interesting one okay you know
40:15 - you guys have uh search in google right
40:18 - you guys know that everybody can raise
40:19 - your hand if you know search and google
40:21 - yes yes yes everybody raise your hand
40:22 - yeah good
40:23 - right you know when you type in things
40:25 - like for example car
40:26 - it gives a suggestion underneath like
40:28 - for example maybe carpet maybe something
40:30 - else it gives you suggestions
40:31 - like autofill world autofill what is it
40:33 - called autocomplete autocomplete
40:35 - autocomplete everybody know that yes
40:37 - right how the [ __ ] do you think it
40:39 - happens
40:40 - how does that work
40:44 - that work right how does that work
40:48 - well that's a good question right how
40:50 - does the article work on google
40:52 - for example again right well it works
40:54 - because of you know what because of this
40:57 - it works because of something called a
40:59 - tree it's actually called a tri
41:00 - tree try tree
41:05 - try tree this is a data structure a tree
41:07 - structure basically
41:09 - that what it goes ahead is it's very
41:11 - fast at being able to predict
41:13 - exactly exactly what you
41:17 - what suggestions to give to you here
41:19 - yeah because think about it
41:21 - if you were trying to create this
41:23 - autocomplete you can't just put
41:25 - all these different words into yeah into
41:27 - an array yeah and that would be like a
41:28 - huge array that would be very
41:29 - millions of words exactly so a tragedy
41:32 - is just
41:33 - structured in the way that you can
41:35 - actually easily
41:36 - figure out the words that can come after
41:40 - a specific uh prefix that you put so if
41:43 - you
41:43 - put ca then car can show up because of
41:46 - the try tree
41:47 - and i don't want to get get too
41:48 - technical with it but for example a tree
41:50 - tri tree looks a little bit like this
41:51 - for example you have c here
41:52 - a here and there's and there's different
41:54 - words that branch out from here you see
41:56 - there's different words that branch out
41:57 - from here kind of like yeah so this is
41:59 - like really geeky nerdy stuff that we
42:01 - love to get into but it's not worth
42:02 - getting to right now it's just worth
42:03 - knowing
42:04 - yes that you have to master data
42:07 - structures because that's how you're
42:08 - gonna start to solve
42:09 - does everybody does everybody understand
42:10 - this right now yes or no raise your hand
42:12 - yes
42:12 - yes everybody good good good good
42:14 - awesome okay cool cool so sweet
42:17 - cool guys now for those hold on hold on
42:20 - can't talk um so we got that portion
42:23 - okay let's go ahead and move on to the
42:24 - next portion
42:25 - i will go ahead and remove this okay
42:28 - next up so just a little bit of a story
42:29 - kind of about me
42:30 - so it's better to make some progress
42:31 - than probably no products at all of
42:32 - course that makes sense yeah so so let's
42:34 - actually talk about
42:35 - what some of these people are actually
42:37 - looking for right yeah
42:38 - you can see here for example they're
42:39 - looking for things like you know
42:42 - expert html css they're looking for
42:44 - understanding of engineering principles
42:46 - right
42:46 - agile sort of development all these
42:48 - different things communication skills
42:50 - very big problem solving skills look at
42:52 - that right there
42:53 - problem solving skills that's just right
42:55 - there right it shows it right there
42:56 - that's exactly what you need
42:58 - same thing here all right same thing
43:00 - here because if you want
43:02 - those jobs guys i know it might be
43:03 - intimidating when you see this big big
43:05 - list of all these different things but
43:07 - it just comes down to these fundamental
43:09 - things that we've talked about which is
43:10 - the problem solving skills
43:12 - making sure you could actually build a
43:13 - integrated app from the front end to the
43:15 - back end
43:16 - and just having that experience there
43:18 - because you know
43:20 - if you send in that application people
43:23 - sometimes get scared like oh there's too
43:24 - many things and not only that something
43:25 - we want to talk about is the experience
43:27 - now yes
43:28 - the experience they always say here five
43:30 - years but this right here
43:32 - here's what i say to that here's what i
43:33 - said that you're ready for this here's
43:35 - what i say to that
43:36 - i say this whoa
43:40 - all right there we go that's spelled
43:41 - better
43:42 - [Laughter]
43:44 - here's what i said that did that they
43:46 - always say five years and [ __ ] like that
43:48 - but trust me that's not what they
43:51 - necessarily look for
43:53 - they are very because it's number one
43:54 - it's hard to get developers at that
43:56 - specific point
43:57 - right and developers are like like not
43:59 - someone who you need five years to be a
44:01 - pro developer you can have six months
44:04 - you can be one year into it
44:05 - and already be a good developer right
44:07 - depending on how much how much you put
44:08 - into it
44:09 - that's why right here right for at least
44:12 - five years like the five year aspect is
44:13 - not the most important part you will
44:14 - still
44:15 - apply to these specific jobs even so you
44:18 - understand that guys
44:20 - comprende with me sending those
44:22 - applications we're going to send those
44:23 - applications regardless comprende
44:25 - exactly good good thumbs up give me a
44:27 - thumbs up
44:28 - yes thumbs up good awesome so as we
44:30 - mentioned guys
44:31 - it doesn't matter what it says just send
44:34 - it in anyways i mean if you're really
44:35 - not qualified in terms of years
44:37 - they'll just not approve who cares send
44:39 - more applications time and time and time
44:42 - again
44:42 - now let's go ahead and dive in into what
44:45 - are some of the things that you have to
44:46 - learn
44:47 - other than just the technical stuff and
44:49 - that is going to be
44:50 - the soft skills how do you actually
44:53 - behave like a person how do you actually
44:55 - show up
44:55 - how do you connect with them how to
44:57 - become someone that they actually
44:59 - want to hire when they're interviewing
45:01 - you how do you answer their specific
45:03 - questions right
45:04 - because we've actually started to look
45:06 - into what are the things that someone is
45:08 - looking for specifically
45:10 - a company and uh can we actually show
45:12 - this next slide
45:13 - of course because in this next slide
45:15 - we're gonna dive deep into the things
45:16 - that you have to do so guys take a
45:18 - screenshot of this
45:18 - take out notebook i don't know whatever
45:20 - is faster for you probably the
45:21 - screenshot
45:22 - look at this stuff because these are the
45:23 - things that people are actually looking
45:25 - for and nas even has a little bit of
45:26 - more insight as well
45:28 - but here when it just comes to generally
45:29 - hiring they want to see that you're
45:31 - coachable that you're willing to learn
45:32 - they want to see that you're emotionally
45:33 - intelligent you're not just like
45:35 - reactive to everything
45:36 - you could have your emotions under
45:37 - control you'd be stable you could be
45:38 - stable you can empathize with other
45:40 - people you could be a regular human
45:41 - being
45:42 - that's what we'll call emotional
45:43 - intelligence being a regular human being
45:45 - you're motivated to do stuff by yourself
45:47 - i think that's a very huge part right
45:49 - you're proactive don't just wait for
45:50 - [ __ ] to just come to you right you
45:52 - motivate to do it by yourself you
45:53 - take initiative this is a very very
45:56 - important aspect of any job
45:57 - and that and if you for example at a job
45:59 - if you want to go ahead and grow
46:01 - grow quickly meaning you want to be able
46:03 - to get those new opportunities you want
46:05 - to be able to
46:07 - uh potentially write make more money
46:09 - right make more money
46:11 - right you have to be able to right have
46:14 - the motivation
46:15 - to take initiative by yourself to take
46:17 - the question by yourself comprende yes
46:19 - or no
46:20 - one who somebody's playing david commute
46:22 - whoever
46:25 - huh all right i think he got muted
46:28 - okay you got him got him cool thank you
46:31 - david okay cool
46:32 - awesome so let's go ahead and keep going
46:33 - all right so next up so
46:35 - all those okay what soft skills does
46:36 - developer need like i said you know
46:38 - very important develop soft skills okay
46:40 - you need to be again you can
46:42 - that's what's up coachable i need to be
46:44 - someone who most importantly
46:46 - communicative when i say communicative
46:47 - what i mean by that i mean someone
46:49 - who does not hide themselves does not
46:52 - hide
46:52 - their problems if you have an issue that
46:55 - at hand
46:56 - you communicated that to the whole team
46:58 - that is
46:59 - the big goal guys now before you go on
47:02 - to the next slide nas
47:03 - nas is about to drop some real secret
47:05 - sauce here
47:06 - because nas got to talk to a recruiter
47:09 - oh yeah right a google record
47:11 - and and ask the recruiter what are you
47:13 - looking for now as a developer as well
47:14 - because this was more general like what
47:16 - do people want
47:17 - so take out the pen notebook make sure
47:19 - if you haven't been taking notes i don't
47:20 - know what you've been doing this whole
47:21 - time but nas
47:22 - drop that knowledge on what the google
47:24 - recruiter was looking for what are the
47:25 - soft skills that people really need to
47:27 - work on
47:27 - yeah so i talked with the google
47:29 - recruiter i had a conversation with them
47:31 - and look at this check this out on
47:32 - christian make sure hey guys please make
47:34 - sure to meet your mics thank you
47:35 - so i had a conversation with a google
47:36 - recruiter and what they literally told
47:38 - us because again
47:39 - because we had this boot camp right and
47:40 - we were kind of we're talking with them
47:42 - you know about potential you know
47:44 - opportunities there so right
47:46 - so google recruiter google google
47:50 - recruiter right here okay here's they
47:53 - told me
47:53 - they told me three simple things one one
47:57 - they are looking for great problem
47:58 - solvers why does it keep not
48:00 - showing hold on
48:03 - freeze mode oh freeze mode on there we
48:06 - go
48:07 - google recruiter yep
48:13 - recruiter okay right
48:16 - so they talked about for example like i
48:17 - said they talked about things like
48:19 - okay you need to be someone who is a
48:22 - great problem solver
48:25 - you need to be someone who crazy enough
48:27 - actually can do clean code
48:29 - clean code they mentioned that which is
48:31 - really interesting clean code right here
48:33 - clean code and they also mention the
48:35 - fact that
48:36 - they look for people who are actually
48:39 - have
48:39 - great eq they are great to work with
48:45 - because would you agree with me who here
48:47 - wants to work with an [ __ ]
48:50 - [Music]
48:52 - try youtube what are you doing
48:56 - right great to work with right
48:59 - and that's what they look for it's it's
49:01 - these three things when they talk and
49:03 - i could mention it to them they look for
49:05 - that really really importantly you know
49:07 - yes exactly guys and again you want to
49:10 - make sure
49:10 - that this is coming from a google
49:13 - recruiter
49:14 - right yes so take that into
49:15 - consideration take that into note
49:17 - because
49:18 - we want to see what are the things are
49:19 - going to make a six-figure developer
49:22 - specifically right we already talked
49:23 - about a lot of these things but what are
49:25 - these qualities now
49:26 - what are we going to do so think about
49:27 - this resourceful analytical skills
49:29 - knowledgeable
49:30 - in technologies great communicator right
49:31 - team player problem solver
49:33 - screenshot this will move on okay
49:34 - screenshot this right now guys everybody
49:36 - next we have an amazing thing where nas
49:38 - is gonna break down
49:39 - for you how you can reverse engineer
49:43 - becoming that six figure developer yes
49:46 - and nas is gonna break down
49:47 - a specific story that he knows about
49:49 - very well so how i'm
49:51 - how i made 300 000 as a javascript
49:53 - developer personally in in the past
49:54 - three years guys that has been an
49:56 - amazing experience for me
49:58 - um it's been a difficult experience it's
49:59 - been a long journey but we got here now
50:01 - okay
50:02 - here are some examples of just my kind
50:04 - of letters that i got from
50:05 - companies right in terms of like what i
50:07 - got the jobs that i got so things like
50:09 - that let me go ahead and take a look at
50:10 - this
50:11 - you can see here for example this was i
50:14 - was i made nineteen thousand dollars
50:15 - almost twenty thousand dollars
50:17 - as my first job right here uh making
50:19 - twenty ninety per hour so this wasn't
50:21 - too bad this was my first
50:22 - uh developer job at the company called
50:24 - urban science and then after that after
50:26 - this internship they actually offered me
50:28 - a full-time job for 65k
50:30 - now i did not actually take that job i
50:32 - actually took a job where
50:33 - at a company called service.com and then
50:35 - because they offered me 70k
50:37 - right away right away kind of after
50:39 - college right away right after i learned
50:41 - basically um after i learned you know
50:43 - coding
50:44 - but the crazy part is that i didn't
50:46 - learn coding through college i actually
50:47 - learned coding
50:48 - through a company through a do i have it
50:51 - on here or no
50:52 - oh there i actually learned coding guys
50:55 - because i joined a startup called
50:56 - trandala this is a startup i joined
50:57 - completely for free
50:58 - basically i was working for free for
51:00 - about almost a year and a half
51:02 - with this company you can see me right

51:09 - right and this is my friend steve this
51:11 - is robert and this is my friend case
51:13 - the case right now is a full developer
51:16 - currently
51:17 - in mexico the guy i talked about before

51:20 - but these guys i work with them together
51:22 - and i'm like listen guys hey i want to

51:30 - contribute i really appreciate this
51:32 - and so crazy enough they gave me like a
51:34 - way for me
51:35 - to they tested me out by giving me a
51:38 - project so they gave me a project to do
51:40 - like they gave me like a you know
51:41 - scraper project
51:43 - project and i had to do it i didn't know
51:45 - how to scrape i didn't know python had
51:47 - anything at all and so but in two days i
51:50 - stayed up till like
51:50 - middle of the night and i actually went
51:52 - ahead and you know create a project with
51:54 - a scraper
51:55 - and then next to you know i'm working
51:56 - with these people and here is where i
51:58 - learned
51:58 - everything between communication right
52:01 - communication between
52:02 - right i had them as mentors right they
52:04 - were such amazing mentors for me it was
52:06 - insane with communication
52:08 - they taught me project management right
52:12 - right they taught me today hey joseph
52:14 - here please make sure to meet yourself
52:15 - thank you
52:16 - they taught me things like you know
52:18 - front development
52:19 - front end coding right front end not
52:22 - front end the front end right
52:23 - all these different things is where i
52:25 - learned development
52:27 - right there right they taught me full
52:30 - stack right so robert
52:31 - right here on the left-hand side he
52:32 - actually is a great guy he knows backing
52:34 - up a very
52:35 - just very please mute yourself thank you
52:37 - for development
52:40 - i learned from them so not only i have
52:42 - great mentors but i just learned a lot
52:44 - from a company and crazy enough look at
52:46 - this
52:47 - oh my god guys come on crazy enough here
52:51 - uh but this is when we launched our
52:53 - application called shandala
52:55 - uh we actually bought t-shirts and we
52:57 - look at this we were outside we were
52:58 - actually making uh
53:00 - t-shirts outside by hand by ourselves
53:02 - because we could not afford to buy
53:03 - t-shirts normally so
53:04 - literally 200 t-shirts came and we made
53:07 - like like literally for
53:08 - for the whole day straight it was
53:10 - [ __ ] insane this is the app to be
53:12 - built called trandala
53:13 - kinda looks like tinder but it's
53:14 - centered for clothing so how cool is
53:16 - that by the way it looks
53:17 - that was pretty cool super cool man how
53:18 - does that look guys no
53:20 - this was built without web technology by
53:21 - the way with webtech yeah
53:23 - i want to download it oh it's not live
53:25 - anymore it's bangkok
53:26 - this is a company i worked with
53:27 - stores.com these guys went bankrupt
53:29 - later on
53:30 - that's a whole that's a whole different
53:31 - story don't worry about that just yet
53:33 - yeah but basically you know i i had a
53:35 - job with this service.com
53:37 - at this company and i and i didn't like
53:38 - it you know i wasn't too happy with it
53:40 - but what i'm doing is i end up taking a
53:42 - risk and i end up actually quitting and
53:43 - i was like i'm out
53:44 - peace out and i was so crazy enough to
53:47 - where
53:48 - my boss literally came in to you know
53:50 - came to me and said you know what
53:52 - i i hear let me tell you this he's like
53:54 - he's like this is serious so he's like
53:56 - he's like man i'm gonna tell you this as
53:58 - a as a father
54:00 - i'm telling you this as a as a as a
54:03 - friend
54:04 - as a financial advisor and as an
54:06 - employer your [ __ ] nuts your [ __ ]
54:08 - us your [ __ ] nuts and your [ __ ]
54:10 - nuts that's like four [ __ ] nuts or
54:11 - four or three times i'm gonna tell you
54:13 - man
54:14 - or something right he didn't want me
54:16 - quit and he said that was
54:17 - stupid for quitting because i was making
54:19 - pretty good money there but the issue
54:20 - was not the money the issue was that i
54:21 - just didn't enjoy it that was a big
54:23 - issue right so
54:24 - uh i know quitting in any way it's not
54:26 - i'm doing freelancing and because i quit
54:28 - guys
54:29 - because i quit i am where i am today
54:33 - i took that risk crazy enough
54:37 - i quit at a point in time where that
54:39 - company was actually succeeding
54:42 - yeah that company was actually about to
54:44 - buy out a company called sears
54:47 - and if they bought them out fully i
54:49 - would have been basically a millionaire
54:51 - because i had shares in the company
54:53 - but at that point in time i just said no
54:57 - so how crazy is that to be able to turn
54:59 - down money like that huh
55:03 - but crazy enough they actually didn't
55:04 - get by the house and they went bankrupt
55:05 - so there you go
55:06 - and now now it has a tesla let's go
55:09 - and this is this was after we go ahead
55:11 - we went ahead and uh
55:12 - you know i quit my job didn't like it i
55:15 - started freelancing
55:16 - [ __ ] got a lot more serious i had to get
55:18 - a lot more serious
55:20 - uh you know had to make some nice
55:21 - pictures so there we go so let's talk
55:23 - results right
55:24 - we had for example you know just just
55:26 - like how i did it right we teach other
55:28 - people to do it in the same format right
55:30 - in the same way
55:31 - just from my experience from god's
55:33 - experience and so forth
55:34 - so people like frank who landed their
55:37 - job making 170k
55:38 - uh contract uh you know at sonos we had
55:41 - daniel
55:42 - not daniel devin who got a six-figure
55:44 - developer job at paypal
55:46 - also making our six figures right we
55:47 - have people like for example rishi
55:49 - he's making 50k misha's actually on here
55:51 - maybe she'll say hi
55:55 - he actually had and he got into a ship
55:57 - as a bigger developer
55:58 - making at least 50k right now and it's
56:00 - crazy
56:01 - right we also have kevin here kelvin
56:03 - kelvin he
56:04 - made his he got into shift from making
56:06 - 52k so it's pretty insane guys well
56:08 - we've been able to transform
56:09 - and bradfield here as well so guys so
56:12 - many so many so many
56:14 - so many success stories it's insane so
56:16 - how how can we take it even further guys
56:18 - that's the question we want to ask right
56:19 - how can we take this event further right
56:22 - well check this out
56:24 - how can i do it the thing is right when
56:26 - we realize this kind of stuff and we
56:28 - realize the issue that there isn't in
56:30 - the developer world there's a huge issue
56:33 - the issue is that a lot of people get
56:35 - into this they have no idea how to
56:36 - connect this that's part one
56:38 - they are lost would you agree with me
56:39 - that you're lost raise your hand if
56:40 - you're if you feel something
56:41 - you're lost you don't know where to get
56:42 - started raise your hand raise your hand
56:44 - raise your hand like if you feel like
56:46 - there's so much out there to learn that
56:48 - you're not sure exactly what to start
56:49 - out with right there we go beautiful
56:51 - right
56:52 - so awesome and we realized that there's
56:54 - not a lot of good resources out there to
56:56 - teach people that right
56:58 - that's another big thing and realize
57:00 - that a lot of people they'll they'll go
57:01 - they'll go to tutorials to go to all
57:03 - these different things but the issue
57:05 - is that they can't code that's the big
57:08 - issue
57:08 - then we also realize that bootcamp these
57:11 - coding bootcamps that are out there in
57:12 - the world
57:14 - right they also can't teach people for
57:17 - [ __ ] either
57:19 - there's no problems people aren't
57:21 - learning and people aren't being taught
57:22 - properly
57:23 - exactly so there's a lot and this is why
57:25 - we've decided because
57:26 - we've been doing this for quite a while
57:28 - we have a different format that we want
57:29 - we want to use
57:30 - we decided to start our own coding
57:32 - bootcamp
57:34 - and this and has been an amazing
57:35 - experience so
57:37 - i kind of want to introduce to you
57:40 - something interesting you might have
57:41 - heard about this
57:42 - if not then check this out because we
57:44 - ourselves
57:46 - have launched a full stack mastery
57:49 - boot camp a couple months ago and that
57:52 - has been
57:52 - a game changer guys this is something
57:54 - that we've been working on for a real
57:55 - long time
57:56 - for developers because we are here to
57:58 - transform we are here to
58:00 - transform people's lives to become
58:03 - developers
58:03 - right in the right way in the right way
58:06 - not in a way
58:07 - where you just make a lot of amazing
58:09 - projects on your portfolio
58:11 - but in a way where you actually learn
58:12 - how to be a coder that's where you
58:13 - actually
58:14 - actually understand to be a coder and we
58:16 - actually have some few students here
58:18 - from from the boot camp who are actually
58:21 - let me see we have ankh for example on
58:23 - his here we have eric martin
58:24 - they're here from the boot camp and they
58:27 - can have
58:28 - tested what the what how that experience
58:30 - has been for them so for example
58:32 - on can you speak for a little bit kind
58:34 - of a little bit about what has your
58:36 - experience been in this bootcamp so far
58:37 - he is part of the first cohort back in
58:39 - january um so
58:41 - let's just speak a little bit about that
58:42 - and we'll see what we got so he's only
58:44 - been here for
58:45 - a little not even two months yet just a
58:47 - month and a half yeah pretty much
58:48 - yeah yeah so how's it been it's been
58:51 - great it's challenging it's fun
58:54 - and i've well i've been through another
58:55 - boot camp but it was nothing like this
58:57 - one this one the instructors actually
58:59 - care
59:00 - that they actually call you out but they
59:02 - mean that they care about what you're
59:04 - learning
59:05 - like i think last week daniel was like
59:07 - helping me through
59:09 - uh stack and then he didn't give up so
59:11 - my own instructor if i didn't get it
59:13 - he'd just move on because that's just
59:14 - taking out his time and then the classes
59:16 - time
59:17 - yeah but for an hour and a half daniel
59:19 - was on my ass about
59:20 - getting the stacks down let's go there
59:22 - yo
59:24 - and then he'll give me like a 20 minute
59:26 - break and then he gets on my ass again
59:28 - so it's sometimes some people take that
59:30 - as like bad but
59:32 - at the same time these two instructors
59:33 - right here like they want you to succeed
59:35 - yeah yeah and if you don't succeed
59:38 - they're going to make sure that the
59:38 - whole class knows
59:40 - so the host class will help you and
59:43 - if you're not in your game we're going
59:44 - gonna be on your ass that's what we're
59:46 - gonna do right
59:46 - so it's not just me and daniel it's me
59:48 - daniel jesse lamb
59:50 - it's david right there's so many so many
59:52 - amazing structures we have in this boot
59:54 - camp
59:54 - and we we what is a different thing do
59:56 - you think we focus on differently than
59:58 - anything anywhere else
60:00 - uh so it's you're focusing on more about
60:04 - algorithms and like
60:05 - data structures where my last boot camp
60:08 - we didn't really focus on that until the
60:09 - end of the bootcamp where we worried
60:11 - about framework
60:12 - yeah and then like something that you
60:14 - don't really need to get into interview
60:16 - because
60:17 - my last bootcamp is basically taught as
60:19 - frameworks but when you go to interview
60:21 - i'm not going to build a website for
60:23 - them they're going to ask me like how
60:24 - can you problem solve this could you do
60:26 - this
60:26 - yeah give me like and talked like
60:28 - there's no communication skills that you
60:30 - can learn
60:31 - at a boot camp it's everyone it's
60:32 - basically everyone for themselves
60:35 - and then if you can learn or not it
60:36 - depends on you but we just got 13k
60:39 - from you and that's it you pay 13k you
60:42 - build some
60:42 - beautiful projects but you can't get a
60:44 - job i cannot i
60:46 - got two interviews because of the name
60:48 - of the university of washington
60:50 - and then they had reference for that but
60:52 - when i was in the interview for one of
60:53 - her expedia
60:55 - they asked me could you make me a
60:56 - recursion function i was like
60:58 - i've never heard of that before
61:02 - but this this yeah this boot camp we
61:04 - learned recursion for like
61:06 - a week and a half yeah two weeks yeah
61:08 - and now on would have been able to write
61:09 - 10 recursive functions in front of her
61:12 - first thing last out baby let's go
61:17 - so you can see right that's the big
61:19 - thing that we have differently here is
61:20 - you know we are very much tied to the
61:23 - results that you
61:24 - get that's that is our main focus my
61:26 - main focus is
61:27 - i want you to [ __ ] know what you're
61:28 - talking about if you don't [ __ ] know
61:30 - what you're talking about i will be on
61:32 - your ass
61:34 - right that's the thing right honestly
61:36 - like for example when he sometimes
61:37 - misses class
61:38 - i'll be like ankh what the [ __ ] are you
61:40 - doing come in here
61:41 - or like when somebody misses class
61:43 - otherwise everybody else will be
61:44 - actually
61:45 - in slack inside will be typing where are
61:47 - you brad where are you
61:48 - where are you come on let's go let's go
61:51 - and so it's like
61:52 - a this amazing community of people
61:53 - helping each other out and they're just
61:55 - there you know that's the cool part
61:58 - about this and i'm pumped because
61:59 - i know that at the end of this i will
62:02 - push on so hard
62:04 - maybe to a point of crying right but
62:07 - he will thank me later and thank us
62:09 - later because he'll get the job
62:12 - and i do have some good news too what
62:14 - tell me i have an interview for
62:16 - internship on monday at gravity pavement
62:25 - all right hold on wait this monday which
62:26 - monday like this monday monday
62:29 - tomorrow tomorrow bro tomorrow hi bro
62:33 - bro
62:33 - do you know that it's gravity payment
62:35 - right for dan price yeah
62:38 - yeah you know that's 70k minimum
62:41 - yeah are you serious yeah
62:44 - i think out there right now ceo he was
62:47 - making millions of dollars a year but
62:48 - instead of
62:49 - taking the millions he split away
62:51 - minimum wage for her salary for each
62:53 - employee is 70k and he only makes 70k
62:56 - just like his employees
62:57 - that's [ __ ] from seattle so i was
62:59 - like
63:00 - i'm gonna work there that's okay i can
63:02 - get coffee or clean floors i'm gonna
63:04 - work there
63:06 - that's fun that's gonna be fun awesome
63:08 - good luck on the interview man okay
63:10 - good luck you're gonna kill it okay
63:12 - awesome awesome man
63:14 - now one final thing on for anyone
63:17 - who is thinking about full stack mastery
63:20 - bootcamp
63:20 - what words you got for them man do it
63:25 - do it i almost quit coding because of my
63:27 - last boot camp
63:29 - i spent three hours with nas in a
63:30 - workshop and he made me like
63:32 - love coding again that's amazing
63:35 - do it don't don't be scared just do it
63:37 - and like and even
63:38 - like for example on he didn't have the
63:40 - money initially to kind of to actually
63:41 - put put down the
63:42 - down payment for him but like frankie in
63:45 - here by the way
63:48 - say hi frankie hi frankie hi frankie yo
63:51 - on your frankie's favorite man he loves
63:53 - you so much here he is
63:54 - yo what's up man i don't know my
63:56 - favorite but you're really cool bro
63:58 - no i'm kidding okay i love you i love
63:59 - you how's it going
64:01 - i'm good good good he he's the one
64:04 - him and he was probably my favorite folk
64:07 - you know
64:07 - favorite instructor wait what nah not
64:09 - nice but
64:10 - frankie gave me like when i first
64:12 - started out with this boot camp i didn't
64:14 - know i was gonna do it
64:15 - i wanted to do it i wanted to learn from
64:17 - these instructors i wanted to be a part
64:19 - of this group
64:20 - but i had 17 in my bank account yeah
64:23 - frankie told me his story of how he
64:25 - started with this team
64:26 - and then i took and then he told me he
64:28 - gives me a week to come at least with a
64:30 - down payment
64:31 - or or anything even 100 200 but then you
64:34 - have to work your ass off
64:35 - yeah at that time i was working amazon
64:37 - flex so he's like you can do it
64:39 - just work six or seven times a shift per
64:41 - week you can probably pay it off
64:42 - yeah so i took i took my pride out the
64:45 - way i never asked to borrow money
64:47 - but i asked my brother and my brother
64:49 - goes when do you need the money by
64:51 - so by the by mid i think it was like

65:01 - deal with it that's [ __ ] amazing dude
65:03 - that's amazing that's the thing you know
65:05 - sometimes
65:06 - we forget that it just takes a risk you
65:09 - know you have to take that risk
65:10 - you have to kind of like take that leap
65:12 - of faith obviously backed up by data
65:14 - right like it's not like you're just
65:15 - taking a
65:16 - leap of faith into something that you're
65:17 - not that you don't expect to get any
65:20 - returns right
65:20 - yeah but at the same time it's that
65:23 - little push and sometimes
65:24 - when you're stuck in patterns of like
65:26 - not taking risk
65:27 - somebody else that's used to that type
65:29 - of pattern has to like
65:31 - push you to like you know that's that's
65:33 - the same reason i pushed on i'm like

67:18 - dream job as a developer
67:20 - freelance full-time doesn't matter right
67:23 - that is where we want to go take you to
67:26 - right
67:27 - now here's some epic coaches we have lam
67:28 - right here we have qazi right here we
67:30 - have
67:31 - nas which is me of course uh right there
67:34 - right we have daniel this great guy
67:35 - right here
67:36 - on the right hand side right we also
67:38 - have people like for example let me see
67:41 - right dave racosa he's in the house and
67:43 - jesse of course amazing jessie
67:45 - is i'm not sure if she's here in this in
67:47 - this current call but

67:50 - you guys so we have cf six
67:52 - teachers guys six teachers to be there
67:55 - to guide you and to handle you the whole
67:57 - time now
67:58 - let's look at this right so how many of
68:00 - you have attended boot camp before raise
68:02 - your hand anybody
68:03 - anybody attend the bootcamp so of course
68:05 - anybody else
68:06 - and martin anybody else that's pretty
68:08 - much just that's fine that's fine so
68:10 - then nick and nick as well so seriously
68:12 - here's the thing
68:14 - and who and i'm not getting the job just
68:16 - yet raise your hand
68:17 - i know like for example i did not right
68:19 - so i did not right and then the same
68:21 - thing with anthony anthony and nick oh

68:31 - the next slide
68:32 - and it's cause you see in the slide guys
68:34 - what you'll notice is that
68:35 - there's a lot of people who have gone
68:37 - through boot camps and they just didn't
68:39 - sufficiently learn
68:40 - what they needed to learn so that they
68:42 - can actually get the job so you know
68:44 - similar to like how onset is he went to
68:47 - this boot camp and he wasn't able to
68:48 - learn a job because he didn't learn the
68:49 - right fundamental skills and that's why
68:51 - we're enforcing
68:52 - those and that's why we're emphasizing
68:53 - those right so what is full stack master
68:55 - okay it was pretty much pretty much your
68:57 - thanos okay
68:58 - uh this is for thanos before full state
69:00 - mastery and this
69:01 - is right here
69:08 - so here's what you guys get with foster
69:10 - master you get four cultural goals per
69:11 - week right
69:12 - you get six of the best coaches right
69:13 - here you get things like the best
69:15 - curriculum right the curriculum that's
69:16 - made to
69:17 - to take you to a first developer not

69:21 - on has said that this curriculum will
69:24 - just build nice projects for you no
69:26 - this curriculum will teach you the
69:27 - fundamentals we'll teach you how to
69:28 - become a proper
69:29 - developer right right you get daily
69:31 - homework and challenges you get feedback
69:33 - and reviews
69:34 - right all that is what you get in this
69:36 - bootcamp it's so one-on-one it's so
69:38 - personal right on top of that one thing
69:40 - one time one thing we didn't mention is
69:42 - on top of that you also get things like
69:44 - for example
69:45 - right we have twice a week we get things
69:47 - like you know uh
69:48 - calls with students so for example you
69:50 - know just homework calls right home
69:52 - coaching calls right
69:53 - homework coaching calls and this is
69:54 - where you get on with the students and
69:55 - you actually get to get to speak

73:06 - exclusive cohort right where we try to
73:09 - limit people for between 15 to 20 people

73:19 - as possible right that's the whole goal
73:22 - with us right

73:33 - raise your hand if you're currently
73:34 - applying anthony are you applying yes or
73:36 - no
73:36 - yes so now let's quickly dive into some
73:40 - of these technical skill sets that
73:41 - they're going to be able to learn
73:42 - right what are the things so while you
73:43 - guys are applying if you are are you
73:45 - guys raising your hands because you have
73:46 - a question are you raising your hand
73:47 - because you're applying

73:52 - marek are you applying
73:54 - beautiful anthony you're replying
73:58 - yes i'm applying but i also have a
74:01 - question go ahead what's your question
74:03 - anthony
74:05 - well i i will admit i'm i'm
74:08 - having some reservations in terms that
74:12 - well i've been part of the clever
74:14 - programming team since like 2019.
74:16 - yeah yeah and i've been sending out
74:19 - applications like crazy
74:21 - since then i could literally tell you
74:24 - i've sent close to like
74:25 - 100 200 applications but i guess because
74:28 - of my location i keep getting rejected
74:30 - where are you at i'm in nigeria
74:34 - oh i see yes yes yes yes yes so it's
74:36 - kind of very frustrating to
74:39 - kind of want to sign up for another
74:40 - bootcamp when
74:42 - like the last one hasn't really worked
74:44 - out well gosh i got i mean i understand
74:46 - right like i can't
74:48 - i can't what i don't think i can tell
74:50 - you pretty much uh pretty much
74:52 - anthony is you know
74:55 - it all depends on how you're being led
74:59 - right it depends on how you're being led
75:01 - right to get that job right
75:03 - because the other book might not have
75:05 - gotten you what you wanted right but
75:07 - doesn't mean that your next experience
75:09 - is your next potential
75:10 - your next potential uh what's it called
75:12 - opportunities will not get you there
75:13 - right
75:14 - you might be missing something might be
75:15 - missing the fundamentals you might be
75:17 - missing that initial first step because
75:18 - in the day i know you're nigeria
75:20 - but even if you're nigeria you can prove
75:23 - to other people what you can do
75:25 - by having the right skill sets right by
75:28 - having the right fundamentals
75:30 - like if i told you right now anthony can
75:32 - you build me a react gs
75:33 - project from scratch right now buy
75:35 - yourself fully can you do that for me
75:38 - yeah from zero portfolio we react no no
75:41 - i'm not saying that you
75:42 - you you went to a tutorial and you
75:44 - copied it i'm saying if i told you right
75:46 - now i started playing
75:48 - yeah i need follower tutorial i wanted
75:50 - to build out myself i wrote the css
75:52 - myself
75:52 - the responsiveness i read everything
75:54 - myself just to prove to myself that i
75:56 - could do it
75:56 - yeah and because i came from like a net
75:59 - background
76:00 - so i've been writing that for like a
76:01 - while now so i branched into react
76:04 - yeah so there's a lot there's a lot of
76:05 - things that might be working here
76:07 - there's a lot of things might be working
76:08 - here right
76:08 - right we have calvin actually who is for
76:11 - example i'll i'll tell you david here
76:12 - posted calvin is actually from nigeria
76:14 - the guy we just we talked about
76:15 - in a little bit right he's from the jury
76:17 - yet he got internship landed in
76:19 - bank of america right so
76:22 - it's possible it's possible anthony
76:25 - right
76:25 - you just number one have to potentially
76:27 - apply more we have david
76:28 - here applied to 500 companies not 200
76:30 - 500 companies
76:32 - right so you just have to keep trying
76:34 - keep trying keep trying you only need
76:35 - one opportunity
76:37 - you understand that so i don't want you
76:39 - to be down by that number one i want you
76:41 - to be down
76:42 - down around that i want you to more so
76:44 - be excited about that it's like you know
76:46 - what
76:47 - i'm not getting it right maybe it's a
76:48 - problem with your resume for example

77:14 - at your resume but that might be your
77:15 - your big issue that you're having right
77:16 - guys
77:17 - so that's the thing okay cool so cool
77:20 - awesome
77:20 - let's go keep going so now uh let's see
77:23 - for now okay
77:24 - so also one other thing that again you
77:26 - could say is again the boot camp will
77:28 - also have an amazing retreat where you
77:29 - will actually come in like for example
77:31 - to la
77:31 - we'll have a retreat with all you guys
77:33 - will come in and you guys to get the
77:34 - chat and we'll have a nice conference
77:36 - it'll be amazing
77:37 - right so here's the technical skills
77:39 - that you will get to learn in here
77:40 - front end html css javascript gs backing
77:44 - apis node.js express mongodb postgresql
77:46 - database design
77:47 - everything need to know to become a
77:50 - foster developer
77:51 - but also git wireframe firebase and a
77:53 - lot more
77:54 - most importantly you will learn here
77:56 - that you will learn the fundamentals
77:58 - right that's what you will learn here
77:59 - the mostly right you will learn
78:01 - all those data structures that we talked
78:02 - about right all those data structures
78:04 - that we talked about just with us
78:06 - you will learn the fundamentals right
78:09 - you will learn data structures
78:14 - data structures
78:19 - right you will learn how to become a
78:22 - problem solver we focus for the first
78:25 - two months guys
78:26 - we focus fully on just problem solving
78:28 - just problem solving and that's it
78:30 - right just problem solving and that's
78:32 - pretty much it
78:33 - that way you have a proper foundation of
78:36 - what it means to become a developer
78:38 - and you can solve any problem it's a
78:40 - hand when you go out there and
78:42 - interview for other jobs that's an issue
78:44 - that a lot of companies actually have or
78:45 - a lot of
78:46 - people have is they they get an
78:48 - interview and they can't go through it
78:50 - because you just can't problem solve
78:52 - like would you even that's one of the
78:53 - biggest issues yes or no
78:56 - so just out guys we have one of well
78:58 - yeah and then of course
78:59 - after the full stack mastery you get to
79:02 - be a thanos
79:03 - that looks like a little bit like this
79:04 - guys with all the all the frameworks all
79:07 - the languages with react.js with kid
79:09 - with node.js with javascript
79:10 - and that looks pretty insane how cool
79:12 - does that look guys huh
79:14 - that's pretty intense hey there we go
79:17 - so guys we actually have for example
79:19 - eric who
79:20 - is in the camp so here can you go uh can
79:22 - you go ahead and speak a little about
79:24 - the boot camp and uh how's your
79:25 - experience been so far
79:27 - here yeah definitely i'm sorry i
79:31 - i know this is a silly question what
79:32 - else would be like do we get one of
79:33 - those gauntlets when we don't when we're
79:35 - done
79:35 - because that would be do you want to do
79:37 - you want to
79:39 - even if it was just like plastic like be
79:41 - like oh look what i got from my bootcamp
79:43 - well basically we actually put the full
79:44 - well what you will get though is we'll
79:46 - have shirts for sure but something
79:48 - something like that we'll have shirts
79:49 - for you guys when you guys graduate
79:52 - um so yeah i think it's easier if i just
79:55 - kind of give a little bit of a
79:56 - background on myself so
79:57 - i am in the last semester of an
79:59 - associate's degree for computer
80:00 - programming and development
80:01 - yeah um but all the way up until
80:05 - covid i was you know restaurant worker
80:07 - service industry bartender
80:09 - stuff like that so i have absolutely no
80:11 - experience um
80:12 - in it and as far as school goes they
80:15 - didn't have any real world projects so
80:18 - starting probably about six months ago i
80:20 - started applying for
80:21 - jobs because that's kind of what my
80:22 - school said and i didn't do any like 200
80:26 - or anything but i
80:27 - applied to probably 40 or 50
80:30 - all the answers were no no so
80:33 - um i actually about yeah this monday
80:36 - i'll be starting
80:38 - uh week three of an apprenticeship oh
80:40 - let's go
80:44 - and i i actually got it based on
80:47 - um projects that we did in the first
80:50 - couple of weeks with this boot camp i
80:52 - was able to show them
80:53 - like the html and css skills that i had
80:57 - and stuff that we did and they were like
80:59 - wow that's really cool that's actually
81:01 - something that we could use
81:03 - and then i explained to them like the
81:05 - terminology that i was able to
81:07 - learn and the problem solving that i was
81:08 - able to learn that school
81:10 - didn't do was also they were able to
81:13 - realize that i
81:15 - am going to be getting to a point where
81:16 - they can really utilize me
81:18 - yeah so that was that was another key
81:21 - factor as to why they were like yeah we
81:23 - want to get you on board because
81:25 - you'll get based on what you told us
81:27 - you're learning in this boot camp you'll
81:29 - get to a point where
81:30 - we watch you as one of our main
81:33 - developers and i was like
81:34 - sweet and you didn't even finish this
81:36 - this is only two months in man
81:39 - yeah exactly and that's what i'm saying
81:41 - it was based on like school
81:44 - they don't they don't really do projects
81:45 - like they teach you that stuff but it's
81:48 - a lot of theory and there's not like
81:50 - explanations as to why you're doing
81:51 - stuff or
81:53 - why you need to learn things as opposed
81:54 - to you guys make it
81:56 - very understood that you're you're
81:59 - learning this
82:00 - in a real world scenario like you're
82:02 - going to use this for xyz
82:04 - when you get into work and you're
82:06 - learning this because
82:08 - you need to know it for building this or
82:10 - how you can build that and so it was
82:11 - very
82:12 - it's definitely helpful just to like
82:15 - from my end to know why i'm learning
82:18 - something yeah and to
82:19 - feel like okay i'm actually going to use
82:22 - this it's actually going to be valuable
82:23 - to me as opposed to sometimes in school
82:25 - you know
82:26 - somebody says here learn this you're
82:27 - like why what's it going to do for me i
82:29 - don't know
82:30 - what's the point i'm wasting my time and
82:32 - i never feel like i'm wasting
82:33 - any of my time in this that's amazing
82:36 - and another huge part i think
82:38 - um totally totally separate from like
82:40 - the actual code
82:41 - but it's like a it's like almost like a
82:43 - family like once you get into it
82:46 - um kind of like uh like onset and stuff
82:49 - you we do like side um in between the
82:52 - coaching calls we do
82:53 - the homework sessions and it's like i
82:56 - went on a couple of them and it's really
82:57 - cool to have interactions with
82:59 - with people like that and for like
83:01 - almost an hour there was
83:02 - five or six of us we weren't even
83:04 - talking code we were just asking each
83:06 - other like personal information and
83:07 - getting to know each other
83:08 - and that was really cool too to have
83:10 - that kind of tight-knit
83:13 - community of a boot camp yeah that's
83:16 - everything
83:17 - that's amazing i'm very happy to see the
83:19 - community and the cool thing is because

87:41 - again it's all about practicing your
87:43 - communication skills that
87:44 - you need to get so much better at okay
87:46 - so phase one fundamentals okay
87:49 - you get all you get to learn lead code
87:51 - from hackering you get to learn problem
87:52 - solving and
87:53 - algorithms okay phase two front end
87:55 - you'll get to learn things like html css
87:58 - to yes
87:59 - git github literally the roadmap we gave
88:02 - you is mapped out to the exact structure
88:04 - that's
88:04 - give you that roadmap because we realize
88:05 - this is what people need exactly
88:07 - backhand right you'll get to learn
88:08 - things like poster project guitar
88:10 - mongodb postcard sequence especially as
88:13 - and also even for example my sequel
88:15 - that's another big one right so my
88:16 - sequel
88:17 - my sequel that's another thing you
88:19 - mentioned you're going to learn okay
88:21 - next up capstone project really cool
88:23 - what we have guys for you
88:25 - is we're going to have people lined up
88:28 - clients actual real clients or the real
88:30 - ideas but the way i got one one more
88:31 - person yesterday by the way too lined up
88:34 - so now we have one more person as well
88:36 - so we're gonna have clients lined up and
88:38 - teams from our boot camp will pick a
88:41 - client
88:42 - and they will work with them directly
88:43 - for the next month or two and they will
88:45 - learn things like you they will learn
88:47 - things like for example
88:48 - you know you know client management
88:50 - skills right this will be as
88:51 - real world as possible right
88:55 - exactly all right there was a real claim
88:57 - management skills
88:58 - project management and so forth and
89:00 - teammate and team skills as well
89:02 - and team skills [ __ ] you don't get
89:04 - anywhere else exactly so if you want to
89:06 - just go to that next page because that's
89:07 - all the exact same things that we have
89:09 - there so
89:10 - we'll have your client might be me but
89:12 - in this case noz got other clients
89:14 - and you're going to be able to go into
89:15 - teams of people you're going to work on
89:17 - this for some time you're going to meet
89:18 - with your clients you're going to have
89:20 - some guidance
89:21 - from your coaches and as nas mentioned
89:24 - before
89:25 - you're going to start to pick out some
89:26 - of these skills that we talked about
89:28 - which is client management
89:30 - project management even learning how to
89:32 - do scrum use trello or jira just to be
89:34 - able to manage your projects
89:36 - you will have meetings with your client
89:37 - on a regular basis you will have many
89:38 - checkpoints it will be and you of course
89:40 - you'll be guided by
89:41 - us the coaches who know what we're doing
89:43 - because we've done this before right
89:44 - so this is the big difference between so
89:46 - many other boot camps and so many other
89:47 - even like
89:48 - universities right we do this kind of
89:49 - stuff and learn these skills is so
89:51 - important right
89:52 - client management right project
89:53 - management scrum trello jira all those
89:56 - phase five is finally land your dream
89:59 - job
90:00 - let's go this is where you will come in
90:02 - and you will come in and you will be
90:04 - uh premier our our recruiting partner
90:06 - will come in and they will actually go
90:08 - ahead and kind of help you out

90:15 - linkedin how to probably do your resume
90:17 - how to properly apply right and of
90:20 - course
90:20 - of course they will do mock interviews
90:22 - with you of those things
90:24 - and then finally they will go ahead and
90:26 - finally um
90:28 - and they'll put you into their machine
90:31 - into their kind of what's it called
90:33 - dashboard to the dashboard
90:35 - where you'll go ahead and uh you know
90:36 - apply for the companies with hundreds of
90:38 - companies
90:39 - that they have so it's a pretty cool
90:40 - you're pretty much kind of guaranteed a
90:42 - job
90:43 - right right if you put in the work of
90:46 - course
90:46 - you know right of course you're typing
90:48 - the work but still that's the whole goal
90:50 - guys look at this
90:51 - resume linkedin interview prep mock
90:53 - interviews how to apply kind of building
90:54 - and so much more
90:55 - so what would it be worth to you if you
90:59 - can become that full stack developer
91:02 - if you could be able to switch your
91:04 - career if you can
91:05 - start to work remotely like how if you
91:08 - could be making 70 to 80k
91:10 - yeah per year all these amazing things
91:12 - what would that be worth to you
91:14 - will be worth to you tell me guys who
91:15 - could tell me
91:17 - marek what do you think
91:21 - you're a mute ah i mean it's priceless
91:25 - prices why tell me why um
91:28 - i mean these these skills set you up for
91:31 - life
91:32 - right that's true that's true for life
91:34 - pretty much right because what but give
91:36 - me like a number for example how much do
91:37 - you think would be worth for you like if
91:38 - you can land a
91:39 - 80 000 job how much do you think that'd
91:41 - be worth to you
91:43 - ah say
91:47 - uh 5k 5k
91:50 - so basically it's only 5k for you to be
91:52 - able to land a thousand dollar job
91:56 - it'll be worth the investment okay okay
91:58 - okay okay
91:59 - okay interesting so what if for example
92:02 - how much university costs for example
92:05 - oh man you're talking
92:10 - you tell me how much i pay for my
92:12 - masters right now yeah yeah yeah
92:14 - uh it's two thousand dollars
92:17 - of course okay of course how many cars
92:19 - are you taking
92:20 - i take one at a time okay so how much
92:22 - have you paid so far how much you can
92:24 - going to pay in the end i pay last year
92:26 - i ended up paying
92:27 - a little bit over ten thousand ten
92:29 - thousand okay you paid ten thousand
92:31 - dollars right there and you're about to
92:32 - pay
92:32 - more two thousand more correct uh like
92:35 - another
92:36 - ten another ten so twenty thousand
92:39 - so there you go now is that 20 thousand
92:40 - dollars worse to you
92:43 - potentially potentially
92:48 - but you don't seem so confident
92:51 - from a masters no but for this i would i
92:55 - would pay
92:55 - anything just to get the fundamentals
92:57 - and everything down
92:59 - so you see that's where that's such a
93:00 - big difference is i love them eric right
93:02 - so look at this guys okay right flat
93:04 - iron school all these other boot camps
93:06 - we've researched all these other books
93:07 - in terms of what they do
93:09 - they are in school fifteen thousand
93:10 - dollars hack reactor
93:12 - eighteen thousand dollars app academy
93:14 - five thousand dollars to do that do some
93:16 - [ __ ] with eighteen percent i'm not sure
93:17 - what that exactly that is
93:18 - lando school thirty thousand and at
93:19 - thirty thousand dollars they also have
93:20 - fifteen thousand option as well so
93:22 - there are fifteen thousand dollars and
93:23 - thirty thousand dollars as well okay
93:26 - okay so this is what what they get so
93:28 - let's not think about this okay
93:30 - now college degree on average sixty
93:32 - seven thousand dollars you'll be paying
93:34 - for
93:34 - on average wow that's [ __ ] insane but
93:37 - it's all worth it because of course if
93:39 - you can get a job
93:40 - as a developer right and the end of this
93:43 - making 80k
93:45 - and then it will serve you for the rest
93:46 - of your life right
93:48 - that's it the first year what the first
93:51 - two you get eighty thousand dollars
93:52 - the second year you get ninety thousand
93:54 - dollars third year 100 and so forth and
93:56 - so forth and now it stacks up like not
93:58 - like nothing right
93:59 - this is where the big difference is so
94:00 - this this is where now we commit right
94:03 - we're like okay this is interesting what
94:05 - can we do now for you guys what can we
94:06 - do for our
94:07 - amazing pdwg students right camera phone
94:10 - no camera's still because it's so good
94:11 - yeah right right is becoming a developer
94:14 - worth worth that money
94:16 - right is it worth the 67 or the 20
94:19 - thousand dollars
94:20 - so far for you mark is it worth that
94:24 - yes yes right just a 20 000 so okay
94:28 - now guys here's the thing
94:32 - so who now here's the deal okay
94:35 - today alfossa mastery cost fifteen
94:38 - thousand dollars for the sixth to
94:39 - seventh month program
94:40 - today right now let me ask this question
94:43 - with all that you get is that it's even
94:45 - just that is that worth it tell me
94:48 - is that worth a marek yeah yeah but

99:56 - martin martin is actually in our boot
99:58 - camp mark can you speak a little
99:59 - about how has it been for you and uh
100:02 - how's booker before you tell me martin
100:05 - well um i initially found clever
100:08 - programmer on youtube
100:10 - and uh i was in a boot camp last year in
100:12 - the uk
100:13 - i also investigated all the other boot
100:15 - camps
100:16 - but this one is just something else um
100:21 - the homework the knowledge of the tutors
100:24 - and
100:25 - just the um togetherness the
100:28 - working together and going back to
100:31 - fundamentals
100:32 - i now feel much better six weeks in i
100:34 - feel i really understand
100:36 - some things which i didn't before in the
100:38 - previous boot camp
100:39 - and uh i can only say you know you might
100:41 - be i was a bit dubious at the beginning
100:43 - but this is just something else that um
100:46 - uh
100:47 - daniel them nars and jesse and
100:50 - everything else you know at the same
100:51 - time
100:52 - i'm a father i'm schooling my
100:54 - six-year-old kid at the same time
100:55 - yeah i live in okay and uh these lessons
100:59 - are sort of at night time and it works
101:01 - but i feel really pleased that i'm
101:03 - actually learning something
101:04 - i can get it done and i would say if
101:07 - you're just feeling
101:08 - a bit hesitant you're missing
101:10 - opportunity go for it
101:12 - thank you martin i appreciate it and
101:13 - like like i remember like you know
101:15 - martin you like like
101:18 - you joined right i feel like how did you
101:20 - like how confident were you before like
101:21 - i know we still have a lot of more
101:23 - months to go right you're gonna be a
101:24 - killer but like
101:25 - how confident were you on a scale one
101:26 - two three how comfortable were you like
101:28 - coding like let's go
101:28 - on one to ten well i thought i knew
101:30 - stuff but
101:32 - you guys showed that you know
101:35 - i'd say about 10 or even less
101:39 - and i think i'm now getting to the 5'6
101:41 - you know
101:42 - and there's a long way to go but you
101:44 - know
101:45 - you guys you've you're really clever
101:48 - programmer is really good on marketing
101:49 - and you get a thousand emails
101:51 - a week a day you know yeah all you guys
101:54 - that are watching this
101:55 - i'm telling you that these tutors they
101:57 - really know their stuff
101:58 - and it goes goes into more depth and
102:02 - they make you do it and they ask you
102:03 - questions and you have to explain it
102:05 - and if you don't understand it they go
102:07 - through it again and again until you do
102:09 - understand it so
102:10 - yeah that's just what i can say you know
102:12 - i
102:14 - just and it's just it's just something
102:16 - that's really good that
102:17 - i would say if you've got any doubts
102:20 - actually you're missing an opportunity
102:21 - if you don't apply for it i would say
102:23 - thank you wow that that actually means a
102:24 - lot to us thank you because we put it
102:26 - you know again
102:27 - you know we we love this so much me
102:29 - daniel jesse you know
102:31 - we love what we do so much that that and
102:34 - it means to us like when people tell
102:35 - like lamar thousands i was like
102:37 - [ __ ] i want to do even more like we're
102:39 - already doing so much for these for
102:41 - these students we're like [ __ ] what else
102:42 - can we do like you know this just brings
102:45 - me like it [ __ ] makes me emotional
102:46 - because
102:48 - i want this to see we're tied to their
102:50 - results we're tight
102:51 - i'm not tied to the 7 500 i'm not tied
102:54 - to what you put in
102:55 - i'm tied to your results i'm tied to you
102:58 - when the sex is seven months right when
103:01 - you finish this

103:10 - i'm able to afford more things right i
103:13 - love what i do
103:15 - that to me is what i'm tied to because i
103:16 - know it gets hard i know it's hard
103:18 - sometimes right
103:19 - right my parents were there i'm
103:22 - personally very thinking for my parents
103:23 - that you know
103:24 - where they went through a lot of
103:25 - different hard work my parents came from
103:26 - ukraine literally
103:27 - they literally came from ukraine with
103:29 - with nothing they came here with 500
103:31 - in the bank account you know my parents
103:33 - they here they
103:34 - my dad [ __ ] he worked 18 hours in the
103:37 - day
103:38 - at a car wash you know my mom cleaned
103:40 - houses for 15 hours a day
103:42 - it's an insane it's an insane process
103:44 - i'll be here frankie here
103:46 - it's insane process but but they took
103:48 - their risk they took the risk
103:50 - they bought they bought plane tickets
103:52 - which cost them 15
103:53 - like i'm not sure how many thousands of
103:55 - dollars and they came here
103:57 - and i just want to kind of thank them
103:59 - back for making that risk because now
104:01 - our lives are so much better because of
104:02 - that
104:03 - and so it makes me happy to not the fact
104:05 - that people who come into this
104:07 - their lives can be not only their lives
104:09 - can be much better
104:10 - but also their kids lives can be better
104:12 - their families lives can be better
104:14 - and the whole future can be better for
104:16 - them that's how exciting
104:17 - about it the other thing i just wanted
104:19 - to say is for me it's a change of career
104:21 - um i've i've been quite successful in
104:24 - broadcast industry post-production
104:26 - and this this is a change of career so i
104:28 - didn't have any developing experience

106:29 - tell me why did you join well i've been
106:33 - like
106:33 - learning code for like what is it like a
106:35 - year before this
106:36 - yeah but
106:40 - just like getting into the fundamentals
106:42 - that ground level of
106:43 - understanding and being able to
106:47 - problem solve on your own accord
106:51 - that that is just so useful as a
106:54 - developer
106:55 - and i think this this boot camp really
106:57 - made that
106:58 - made that happen and i'm very i like i
107:01 - feel like i can own the knowledge
107:05 - like there's a sense of confidence and
107:07 - what you know
107:09 - so and make no mistake this is a boot
107:13 - camp so
107:14 - you have to go through the ropes as well
107:17 - like
107:18 - and these these instructors are really
107:21 - awesome
107:22 - they are a godsend and that's the thing
107:23 - man a lot of people and i don't mean to
107:25 - cut you off but that's the thing a lot
107:27 - of people
107:27 - don't realize that you know you only get
107:30 - paid because you have the skill because
107:31 - you can actually understand the code
107:33 - right and it's what we keep seeing and
107:35 - seeing time and time again
107:37 - that you know we have people in our
107:40 - community that
107:41 - even already have jobs sometimes but
107:43 - they go
107:44 - let's say 10 steps ahead and they're
107:46 - already building projects with
107:48 - you know certain frameworks like react
107:50 - when their
107:51 - fundamentals are not yet you know
107:52 - completely
107:54 - on point you know so we started seeing
107:57 - this pattern a lot a lot a lot and we
107:58 - started giving a lot of importance to
108:00 - that
108:00 - you know helping the students gain
108:03 - confidence within themselves because
108:04 - like you said
108:05 - you're able to actually own the code
108:07 - yourself yeah pretty much that's how it
108:09 - feels
108:10 - yeah and now how do you how do you feel
108:12 - now yeah how do you feel now kind of
108:13 - how come do you feel now kind of after
