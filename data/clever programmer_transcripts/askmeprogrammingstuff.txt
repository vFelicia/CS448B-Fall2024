00:00 - - What's up, guys.
00:01 - This is Qazi from cleverprogrammer.com.
00:03 - Welcome to the live stream
of Ask Me Stuff with Qazi.
00:09 - The main reason I'm actually
doing this live stream
00:11 - is I wanted to just check
out this new tripod thing
00:13 - I got for my phone,
00:15 - but I was like why not just make it fun
00:17 - and bring a lot of value to
you guys, an insane amount?
00:20 - So if you guys ask me awesome questions,
00:23 - I'll just jump in, dive in,
00:25 - and we'll just start going
hard answering your questions.
00:28 - So use this time, take advantage
of this time, leverage it,
00:31 - and I will give you my best,
(fist thuds)
00:34 - but let's just start going.
(fingers snapping)
00:35 - I'm excited.
00:37 - Jeremiah asks, when did you
first start programming?
00:40 - I started programming,
00:41 - the first time I programmed
ever when I was 18,
00:44 - and I did some stuff with it.
00:45 - And then I quit, 'cause
I got stuck in problems,
00:48 - and I stopped, so there you go.
00:51 - Where to start programming
by GAMING ORIGINS.
00:55 - Welcome, GAMING ORIGINS.
00:56 - How you're doing, my friend?
00:58 - You can start programming
as early as you want.
01:00 - Dima says, what's the best
site to learn programming
01:02 - if I want to learn machine learning,
01:04 - and if I have no experience?
01:05 - Dima, that's a really good question.
01:08 - I always go to Udacity
to learn stuff first.
01:10 - I love Udacity, go there.
01:12 - And then go to Coursera, and stuff.
01:14 - Rubessh asks, how much do you earn?
01:16 - I was making $104,000
a year as a developer,
01:19 - then I scaled it to about
150 as a freelancer.
01:22 - Can I learn Python through smart,
01:23 - and now I run a business, so
I make fuckton more than that.
01:25 - Can I learn Python through smartphone?
01:27 - Absolutely, you can, you can.
01:30 - Wiilka asks, what courses I have to take
01:33 - when I want to become web
developer and designer?
01:35 - Again, look at Udacity, look at Coursera.
01:38 - Would you ever hang out with subs?
01:40 - I would love to.
01:40 - If you are in LA or San Diego,
01:43 - I would love to hang out with you.
01:46 - What are classes in Python?
01:48 - Those are object-oriented
programming, so learn that.
01:51 - Michael says, I would love
for you to be my mentor.
01:53 - Awesome, I'd love to be your mentor.
01:55 - Look into our Profitable Shortcut program.
01:56 - Can I learn the core
of Django in one month?
01:58 - Yes, you can.
01:59 - You can learn that in less than one month
02:01 - if you just go hard at it.
(hands slap)
02:02 - And The Profitable Programmer
course will teach you.
02:04 - Take a look at that course.
02:06 - To become a web developer,
which is the fla la la la la la?
02:10 - Aaron, if you can pull up these questions,
02:11 - then I can actually see them.
02:12 - 'Cause right now, they're
vanishing at a speed of light.
02:19 - Okay, cool.
- Wait.
02:20 - Let me get the, this kinda dies.
02:22 - - All right, I got a laptop.
02:23 - I got your guys' questions
all the way right here,
02:25 - and I can answer them.
02:27 - I also wanna just talk
about everybody who joined
02:29 - our Earn $1K with Python program,
02:34 - guys, I want you to
please be a little patient
02:36 - in that program.
02:38 - We had about roughly 500 students join.
02:40 - So we're actually looking,
02:42 - we're hiring full-time customer
support, so we can actually
02:45 - give you faster responses.
(fingers snapping)
02:47 - So if you're not getting
responses to certain things,
02:49 - just know that our team is
trying as hard as possible.
02:52 - Aaron, come over here.
02:54 - This guy has been literally
not getting sleep,
02:56 - and working his ass off.
02:57 - - Yeah, pretty much.
02:58 - - Missing his gym.
02:59 - - Yeah.
- So you gotta get back
03:00 - to gym, bro.
(Aaron laughs)
03:01 - Okay?
- Yeah, I will tomorrow.
03:02 - - So he has to do that.
03:03 - But just know that we're there for you.
03:05 - We're doing everything we can.
03:06 - And we'll help you out
03:07 - and get back to you as fast as possible.
03:09 - All right, now let's see.
03:11 - Brandon says, wait, how
can we get you as a mentor?
03:14 - This is shaking, about
to fall, be careful.
03:16 - - [Aaron] Sorry.
03:17 - - Thank you, bro.
03:19 - Again, look into our program
called Profitable Shortcut.
03:22 - Send us a email about
it, and we can tell you
03:24 - about how you can potentially
have me as your mentor.
03:28 - All right, let's see.
03:31 - Kasi asks, how long
should I code in a day?
03:33 - I would say about two to
three hours, if not more.
03:36 - I was coding about 15 hours a day,
03:38 - but that's also 'cause
I didn't have a life.
03:40 - So you can make that decision on your own.
03:45 - These are really good,
quality questions, guys.
03:47 - I'm fucking loving these.
03:48 - So please keep asking
questions like these,
03:51 - and I will just keep
going in on all of them,
03:53 - and I will be providing
you with a lot of value,
03:55 - and I'll go fast, okay?
(fingers snapping)
03:56 - So I love this when you guys
03:57 - ask really thoughtful questions,
so thank you for that.
04:00 - I really appreciate it.
04:03 - Okay, what courses I have to
take to become a web developer?
04:06 - Wiilka, I would say learn
the basics of a language.
04:08 - So if it's Python, learn
the basics of Python,
04:11 - then learn a framework like Django,
04:13 - so go through a Django course,
and you will be on your way
04:16 - to become a web developer, all right?
04:18 - Obviously, there's other
stuff you have to learn, too,
04:20 - HTML, CSS, and all that.
04:22 - Again, everything we cover
in Profitable Programmer,
04:24 - so that's something you can
email us about qazi@cle.
04:26 - Oh, no, don't email that one,
04:28 - 'cause that's mine, and I don't check it.
04:31 - Email support@cleverprogrammer.com.
04:33 - That's what the entire team checks,
04:36 - and we'll respond to you.
04:37 - Goldenhoney says, to
become a web developer,
04:40 - which language of the three languages
04:42 - should be learned first?
04:44 - So I don't know which three languages
04:45 - you're talking about, Goldenhoney,
04:47 - but you should learn
definitely a back end language,
04:50 - so whether it's Python or JavaScript.
04:53 - You should learn HTML,
you should learn CSS.
04:55 - Those aren't really programming languages,
04:57 - but you should still learn HTML, CSS.
05:01 - All right.
05:03 - Pramila asks, how much time
does it take to learn Python?
05:07 - Languages can take,
05:09 - to learn the basics, it should
take you less than a month
05:12 - if you actually go into it.
05:15 - Can you get a job in Silicon
Valley without a degree,
05:18 - Christine asks, Christine Smith.
05:20 - Absolutely, you can get a
job without getting a degree.
05:23 - There are tons of people who have jobs
05:25 - in places like Silicon Valley
without having a degree.
05:29 - We're actually gonna be
interviewing somebody
05:32 - as well who got a job at Google,
05:34 - I think without getting a degree,
05:35 - so that's also gonna be really awesome.
05:39 - Michael, okay.
05:41 - What other questions do we have?
05:48 - Aditya says, I want Earn $1K course.
05:50 - That course is gonna be, it's
not available anymore, guys.
05:55 - If you missed your chance to get it,
05:57 - you can get on the wait list for it.
05:59 - But the course is not gonna be open
06:02 - until a few months from now.
06:04 - Also, anybody who is
in the Earn $1K course,
06:07 - we're adding more stuff to it.
06:10 - So we're gonna keep adding
more and more stuff to it,
06:12 - and if you're in that course already,
06:14 - you're just gonna get that stuff for free
06:16 - as our gift to you.
06:17 - So that's what we did in The
Profitable Programmer as well.
06:20 - We added so many new modules,
06:22 - and all that stuff came to everybody
06:24 - who had joined for free.
06:25 - And then when we increase
the price of the course,
06:28 - it didn't affect the
people who were already in.
06:30 - So if you're in Earn $1K,
relax, enjoy, eat some popcorn,
06:33 - sit back, watch a movie.
06:35 - And in the meantime, my boy, Aaron,
06:37 - and I are putting together
a brand-new Python tutorial
06:41 - in there as well for you.
06:43 - Okay, blah blah blah, let's see.
06:45 - How do you feel about the future?
06:46 - Dima, I answered one of your questions,
06:48 - so I'm gonna come back to you after.
06:50 - Brandon says, how can we
get you to be our mentor?
06:53 - Brandon, I think I've answered it,
06:54 - but definitely email us about
and ask in the headline,
06:59 - the subject line, about
Profitable Shortcut.
07:02 - (sighs)
07:04 - Oscar says, I'm starting to use UiPath,
07:07 - and noticed that default
regular expressions
07:09 - are based on Virtual Basic, VB.
07:11 - Would it be better to add Python
add-on, and use it instead?
07:14 - Yes, Python is always gonna
make your life easier.
07:18 - So learn regular expressions with Python.
07:22 - Dendi asks...
07:24 - Oh, ARAVINDH asks, why can't you post
07:26 - your gym workouts on YouTube?
07:28 - Let's fuckin' do it.
07:29 - - [Aaron] (laughs) All right,
07:30 - I'm down.
- If you guys want it,
07:31 - let's do it.
07:32 - Guys, I've been getting more jacked.
07:33 - - [Aaron] Yeah, I've
been getting my ass beat.
07:34 - (Aaron laughs)
- Mm.
07:36 - Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.
07:37 - Yeah, (laughs) this guy's
been getting his ass beat.
07:39 - I've been practicing on
him, which is awesome.
07:41 - - [Aaron] (laughs) For you.
07:43 - - Yeah, all for you,
we'll record that content,
07:46 - and put it on as well.
07:47 - I've been really enjoying.
07:48 - I've been improving in boxing a lot.
07:50 - I was really sucky at it.
07:52 - Now, I'm a little bit better.
07:54 - And yeah, it's been a fun journey.
07:56 - I'm competing in my first
powerlifting competition May 25th.
08:01 - So if any of you are really
good at powerlifting,
08:03 - and working out, and all that,
08:05 - feel free to message me
on Instagram or wherever,
08:09 - and I could use your
guidance on nutrition,
08:11 - or lifting, or any of those things, okay?
08:14 - So that would be really cool.
08:17 - EpicodeCFK asks, how do deal
08:19 - with people trying to discourage you?
08:20 - You have asked the right person.
08:22 - (chuckles) Good question.
(Aaron chuckles)
08:24 - Lately, people have been, not just lately,
08:27 - but I've went through so many
08:30 - of my own mental and identity crisis.
08:32 - Even last year, I had
this breakdown randomly
08:35 - where I was walking.
08:39 - It was super cold in Chicago,
08:41 - and I remember I just got out of my car,
08:44 - and I started walking in
like negative 10 degrees
08:48 - or something, all right?
08:49 - It was freezing.
08:50 - And I took my jacket off.
08:51 - And I walked for probably a mile,
08:54 - and I was shivering, and I was so cold.
08:57 - And I had this weird pit in
my stomach, this gut feeling,
09:00 - 'cause I was around that time,
09:02 - while there were a lot of
good comments coming in,
09:05 - most people who take action
and are doing good stuff,
09:08 - they're just quiet.
09:09 - So they don't oftentimes
even take the time
09:12 - to comment or like your stuff.
09:14 - They're just busy doing things.
09:16 - Whereas a lot of the negative people
09:18 - are spending a lot of time
writing negative comments,
09:21 - and are really loud,
09:22 - and have no fear of saying
that you're a scammer,
09:25 - or you're ruining people's lives.
09:27 - And here I am with my team,
09:28 - we're literally coughing up blood
09:30 - trying to create products for you guys,
09:32 - or trying to create content.
09:34 - 300 videos-plus is no joke.
09:36 - It takes a lot of time, a lot of money,
09:37 - a lot of effort, and a lot of sacrifice,
09:39 - giving up a lot of my social life, too.
09:42 - And I remember all those
things were getting to me,
09:44 - and I just started all a sudden
09:46 - in the negative 10 degrees temperature
09:48 - in Chicago just started fucking crying.
09:50 - Tears just started coming out of my eyes,
09:52 - and I couldn't control them.
09:54 - And I was like what the hell is happening?
09:57 - It was so random.
09:59 - And I remember I called
one of my mentors, Billy,
10:02 - at the time, and I told him, I'm like,
10:04 - "I don't know who to explain this to.
10:05 - "I don't know why I feel like this,
10:07 - "but I feel so discouraged.
10:08 - "I just wanna quit.
10:09 - "I don't wanna make any new content.
10:11 - "I don't even wanna code anymore.
10:13 - "I don't wanna do any of this.
10:14 - "I just wanna stop."
10:17 - And I'm like, "What do I do, dude?"
10:19 - And he just told me, he's
like, "Well, that's cool."
10:22 - He's like, "Then just stop."
10:24 - He's like, "It's not
above your mental health.
10:29 - "It's not over, it doesn't
take priority over your life."
10:33 - So he's like, "Just fucking stop."
10:36 - And all of a sudden,
10:39 - it was almost as if all this giant burden
10:42 - that I had on me just vanished.
10:46 - And I went from being
so scared and frightened
10:48 - to I was like, fuck it, I'm
just gonna now destroy it.
10:52 - I'm gonna grow this channel
to a whole another level.
10:55 - And then when I started getting support,
10:57 - then when I started working with people
10:59 - in a more deep and impactful way.
11:01 - So for example, in our
Profitable Shortcut program,
11:03 - which is my absolute favorite
thing I get to do every week
11:08 - where students from Clever Programmer
11:10 - are part of the Profitable
Shortcut program.
11:12 - And I basically get to
speak with them one-on-one,
11:15 - or in a group coaching fashion,
11:17 - but I get to actually speak with you.
11:20 - Oh, my God.
11:21 - And every week,
11:22 - they take massive fucking
action and have wins.
11:25 - If you look up a channel
called Sayem Studios, Sayem.
11:29 - And please go show him some love, guys,
11:30 - I would really appreciate
it, Sayem Studios.
11:32 - He put this new video.
11:35 - So that's his channel name,
11:37 - and then his new video
is called AI in 2019.
11:41 - So check out his channel,
show him some love.
11:44 - In the Profitable Shortcut program,
11:46 - we decided that's what we
were gonna take action on,
11:48 - and that's what he was gonna do.
11:49 - And he went ahead and made a video
11:51 - and put up his fricking
channel on YouTube.
11:54 - To me, that's such a huge win.
11:56 - That's so deep and impactful
that I feel so strong
12:00 - that I just don't give a
shit about any of the haters.
12:03 - I just don't care at all.
12:07 - As a matter of fact, I welcome the haters,
12:09 - and I'm just like bring them on.
12:11 - I'm actually excited.
12:13 - And my team is so fired up.
12:14 - And the people around
us who are action takers
12:16 - in the Clever Programmer
community, in our programs,
12:20 - they're just winning at a
whole, like a stupid level.
12:24 - They're just winning at
a whole another level.
12:26 - They're getting clients every week.
12:28 - They're landing big deals,
they're landing clients.
12:31 - It's really awesome.
12:32 - But more than just even
clients, they are taking action.
12:36 - Some of them are starting to
build their own personal brand,
12:38 - so to me, that's awesome.
12:39 - This one girl, hager_mahmoud,
she tagged me on her IG post,
12:44 - and she's not even in any of our programs.
12:46 - She's just part of the
Clever Programmer community.
12:48 - And when we started the
30-day Coding Challenge,
12:51 - she is doing double
30-day Coding Challenge.
12:54 - Not only is she doing
the 30 days of coding,
12:57 - but she's actually going
working out as well.
12:59 - And she tags me in her post that she coded
13:02 - and she worked out every day.
13:04 - That makes me come alive.
13:05 - And that makes me just wanna
keep doing so much more things,
13:10 - and just keep going nonstop.
13:12 - So this year, Clever Programmer
13:14 - is gonna turn into a fucking cult.
13:18 - We're gonna have a strong
community of winners.
13:20 - And my goal is really
to get a small amount
13:23 - of people absurd amount of results.
13:26 - And everybody who makes
excuses, is stingy,
13:28 - doesn't believe, they can just vanish.
13:32 - It's okay if my subscriber count goes
13:33 - from 300,000 to 20 subscribers.
13:36 - But I'd rather have those
20 people be action takers
13:39 - and actually make a
difference in the world
13:41 - rather than 300,000 people,
99%, or I don't know,
13:46 - a big amount of them who might
not take action, you know?
13:49 - So I want to have a community of people
13:53 - where we're all very positive,
we're very encouraging,
13:56 - we love each other, we
genuinely care for each other,
13:59 - we want to inspire each other
in the programming world,
14:02 - we wanna help each other
get careers, get jobs,
14:05 - we help each other even network.
14:07 - And I want us all to just win
14:09 - at a massive level outside
of programming in workouts,
14:16 - in relationships, with family,
with free time, with travel.
14:19 - I want us to win in
every possible way ever.
14:22 - That's what I'm really
excited about this year.
14:25 - Yeah, and it all came from that question
14:27 - (laughs) about working out.
14:30 - So yeah, we'll try to post
some working out stuff, too.
14:33 - Okay.
14:35 - Brandon, definitely, man.
14:38 - If you're interested in joining
14:39 - or you wanna learn more about
Profitable Shortcut program,
14:42 - it's a pretty premium
program, so reach out to us.
14:46 - We're gonna send you...
14:48 - For anybody that's
interested in joining, right,
14:50 - we have an application for it.
14:51 - And basically what you have to do
14:53 - is you have to apply for this program.
14:55 - It's not easy to get into.
14:57 - And if you are a good fit,
we get on a call with you.
15:00 - We make sure that your
goals are aligned with,
15:04 - like your goals, we can help you achieve,
15:07 - and if we're both a
good fit for each other,
15:09 - and then we'll essentially
go from there, all right?
15:12 - So if you're interested, send us a email
15:13 - at support@cleverprogrammer.com.
15:15 - Write Profitable Shortcut
in there somewhere,
15:17 - and we will get back to you.
15:19 - Okay, what?
15:20 - Okay, I'm gonna go through
other questions we got.
15:23 - So EpicodeCFK, I hope that helps you
15:28 - on how to deal with discouraging people.
15:30 - Fuck discouraging people.
15:31 - Let them fuel you.
15:32 - Be antifragile.
15:34 - Read the book, Antifragile.
15:35 - The more somebody tries to break you,
15:37 - the stronger you should get.
15:38 - And lately, this year especially,
15:40 - I've been feeling like that.
15:42 - And one thing that has helped me
15:43 - is a very small circle of
just real people who I love,
15:48 - and we love making a difference.
15:49 - So that's what's been really awesome.
15:51 - Okay, Michael says, what
IDE can I use for Python?
15:54 - Is PyCharm good?
15:55 - Use PyCharm, don't use anything else.
15:57 - Just stick with PyCharm, it's awesome.
15:59 - Havoc says, I've recently
learned HTML and CSS.
16:02 - What programming language
should I learn next?
16:04 - And you know, trigger finger, bro.
16:08 - And you don't need 20 minutes of clips,
16:10 - just like 10 seconds here and there
16:11 - when I'm really going,
(fingers snapping)
16:12 - but just stay on top of that, please.
16:13 - Love you.
16:14 - Okay, so sorry, Havoc's question is,
16:17 - so I have recently learned HTML and CSS.
16:19 - What programming languages
should I learn next?
16:23 - And do you know where I can find resources
16:26 - that explain/teach these
programming languages?
16:29 - Okay, great.
16:31 - Well, if you've learned
HTML and CSS, learn Python.
16:35 - I have a free course on Python.
16:36 - Look up Python programming,
and type in Clever Programmer.
16:41 - It's the best Python
programming intro course
16:44 - that there is out in the world.
16:45 - I firmly believe that.
16:47 - Go through that course, it's free.
16:49 - Enjoy it, get massive
amounts of value out of it.
16:53 - And if you're ready,
16:54 - you can join our Profitable
Programmer course,
16:55 - which goes deep into Django.
16:57 - That course is massive.
16:59 - It's about 60-plus hours of 4K content.
17:02 - And it's just unbelievable, okay?
17:04 - It has interviews with the
best developers in the world,
17:08 - founding engineers of
Codecademy, Facebook.
17:11 - The CEO of Repl.it is in there.
17:15 - The Coding for Entrepreneurs
guy, Justin, yeah, Justin,
17:19 - Justin is in that course.
17:21 - And more than that, you just
make tons of applications,
17:24 - and all with Python and Django.
17:25 - So that's a good process to
go and become a web developer.
17:30 - ARAVINDH, I'm gonna skip your question.
17:34 - Brandon says, you did answer,
17:36 - but I would rather join your team, how?
17:39 - Well, if you're interested
in interning with us
17:42 - and joining our team,
17:43 - then also send us a email at
support@cleverprogrammer.com,
17:47 - and say something like
intern, or intend to intern,
17:51 - I don't know, something
in the subject line
17:53 - that talks about you
wanting to join the team.
17:56 - And then let us know
what skill you can offer,
17:59 - what are your skills,
18:00 - and we might be able to
bring you on on the team.
18:02 - And if somebody decides to intern,
18:04 - you would have to move to LA.
18:06 - You would have to be local here.
18:08 - And I would happily train
you in coding, in lifting,
18:13 - in boxing, in Jiu-Jitsu,
in life, in sales,
18:18 - and whatever thing I can help you with.
18:21 - And I would get your
help with either video,
18:24 - or programming, or software
development, or whatever it is.
18:27 - And then if you're awesome,
then you can even join the team,
18:30 - and we can have you as
full-time or part-time.
18:32 - So send us a email, and that
could be something pretty cool.
18:36 - All right, Brandon says, how old are you?
18:38 - I'm 24.
18:39 - Okay, let's see.
18:40 - Which book is best for Python?
18:42 - Computer Science by John Zelle,
18:44 - really good book to start off with.
18:46 - Christine, you are welcome.
18:48 - Rich Burnau, what's up, Rich Burnau?
18:50 - I love Rich Burnau.
18:51 - He's on our Instagram,
18:53 - and I message him back and forth a lot,
18:55 - so Rich Burnau is my buddy.
18:57 - And he asked me, favorite
frameworks, and why?
19:00 - For me, favorite framework is Django,
19:03 - because it's made for
perfectionists with deadlines.
19:08 - And that's it, (laughs) so I love it.
19:12 - It helps you do shit faster than Node.js.
19:14 - If I'm working with a client,
19:15 - I would much rather use Django,
19:17 - because it already comes in
19:19 - with a dashboard completed functionality,
19:22 - or administrator functionality
19:24 - such as a WordPress blogging website,
19:26 - which means that you don't
19:27 - have to spend hours building that,
19:30 - and it makes you look professional.
19:31 - So if you build something for your client,
19:32 - then you just go, oh, hey,
19:33 - I have this dashboard
administrator functionality
19:36 - that I built in, but you didn't,
19:38 - because Django did it
for you, so I love it.
19:41 - Saves you a lot of time.
19:44 - Dinesh says, your glasses are
like, mm, damn, it's so fancy.
19:49 - Thank you so much, my man.
19:50 - I love these glasses, too.
19:52 - These glasses are so good that before,
19:55 - I used to get uncomfortable,
and take off my glasses.
19:58 - Now I get uncomfortable,
and put on my glasses,
20:00 - 'cause they're so good.
20:02 - Rubessh says, are you from Pakistan?
20:04 - Yes, I am.
20:06 - Do you regret Lear?
20:09 - The hell?
20:09 - I don't understand what that means.
20:11 - Christine says, Christine Smith says,
20:13 - how do you balance social
life with being ambitious?
20:15 - You combine the two.
20:16 - So I was having this discussion
with my friend, Aaron.
20:19 - And basically, what he wants
to do is meet people randomly.
20:23 - And what I want to do
that is really awesome,
20:27 - that I like doing, and it
makes it easier for me,
20:30 - is I've always had this.
20:32 - How do I combine my social
life, and how do I combine,
20:37 - and still grow as a person,
become better as a human,
20:42 - still keep up with my
personal development stuff,
20:44 - still improve my business, and health?
20:46 - Well, I think I figured it out.
20:48 - Go to meetups.
20:50 - Go to meetups where
people are hiking, okay?
20:53 - You're gonna automatically
find people in these meetups
20:56 - who are focused on winning in life,
20:59 - who are focused on growing
themselves so much so
21:02 - that they went out of their way
21:03 - to actually apply to a
meetup and get there.
21:06 - They're gonna be focused
on entrepreneurship.
21:09 - A lot of them are gonna
be focused on business.
21:11 - You're gonna learn a
lot about that as well.
21:13 - So I would suggest you to go to meetups.
21:16 - I think that will be a phenomenal thing
21:18 - that you can do with your time.
21:21 - And that way, you can handle
all the things the same time.
21:24 - Faiz ulla says, what are your
thoughts on doing business?
21:26 - I like programming a lot,
21:27 - but I don't wanna be stuck
doing the nine-to-five job.
21:29 - I want to generate passive income.
21:31 - Any advice?
21:32 - Well, that's a great question,
21:33 - and that's exactly what I was
doing at the age of 21, 22,
21:38 - when I was going to UIC,
21:39 - and I was making over $100,000
a year, $104,000 a year.
21:43 - I was freelancing,
21:45 - and I had these two
developers that I had under me
21:47 - that I had hired essentially from Upwork.
21:50 - And I was project managing them.
21:51 - And they were putting in the work.
21:53 - I was managing them.
21:55 - I was good enough to manage them,
21:56 - and I was also reliable enough
21:59 - and had good enough communication skills
22:01 - to speak with my client.
22:02 - So I spoke with my client,
I spoke with my freelancers,
22:05 - I managed the project,
and then we delivered it,
22:08 - and my client was happy,
the freelancers were happy,
22:10 - and everybody fuckin' won.
22:13 - And I collected my paycheck.
22:15 - Meaning I was playing pool
with my friend, Tenzin,
22:18 - and I was getting paid $60,
or $70, or whatever it was.
22:23 - I think I negotiated them to $100 an hour,
22:25 - and they were paying me $100 an hour.
22:27 - And that gave me enough profit margin
22:29 - to pay off my developers,
22:31 - and then still be making over $60 an hour.
22:35 - And that was happening.
22:37 - My developers were working for that client
22:39 - even when I would be at school,
22:43 - or even when I was spending
time with my family.
22:45 - So that was my way of
earning passive income,
22:48 - but not in the stupid way
of earning passive income.
22:53 - I felt like this was a lot better,
22:54 - and it felt like a business,
22:56 - and I wasn't stuck to a nine-to-five job.
22:58 - I had freedom to travel and
do everything that I want.
23:01 - So that's one way I would
recommend for you, Faiz.
23:07 - All right, other questions.
23:09 - Dendi says, what's the best way
to destroy limiting beliefs?
23:11 - Because it's so annoying for
the programmer to move up.
23:16 - Be around a lot of people
23:17 - who don't have lots of limiting beliefs.
23:19 - And they don't have to be
in the programming world.
23:21 - They could be in different worlds.
23:23 - So this one girl that I
spend a lot of time with
23:25 - that I'm dating right
now, her name is Amberley,
23:27 - she is a pro boxer.
23:29 - She's a synchronized
swimming Olympic athlete.
23:33 - She fucking, there's
nothing that she doesn't do.
23:36 - She's running from LA
to Vegas, 350-mile run.
23:40 - She's gonna be doing that in a few weeks.
23:42 - She's a Nike-sponsored athlete.
23:44 - So what do you think happens
when I'm just around her?
23:48 - Do you think my brain has
room to grow limiting beliefs?
23:52 - Fuck no.
23:53 - I don't even have room to grow doubt,
23:55 - because I'm around
somebody who has no doubt.
23:58 - So then my doubt starts to go away.
24:00 - I'm like, okay, if she can do that,
24:01 - I can at least do one thing, right?
24:03 - I can at least get on a live
stream and speak with you guys.
24:06 - I can at least make
one video a day, right?
24:09 - Because she's waking up at 5:00 a.m.,
24:11 - and going for a 20-mile
run, so I can do that.
24:14 - So be around people
who don't make excuses,
24:17 - and who do stuff.
24:18 - Aaron is eating 3,000
calories every day almost
24:21 - without making any excuses.
24:22 - And he was a skinny guy just like me
24:24 - who went from 100 pounds,
110 pounds to 155 pounds
24:31 - in a course of a few months,
and I wanna do that as well.
24:33 - So I'm around that person,
24:34 - and I don't have room for limiting belief,
24:36 - because he helps take that away from me,
24:39 - and I'm just gonna keep improving.
24:41 - So with programming, do the same thing.
24:42 - Be around people who are so frickin' good,
24:45 - they don't have any
limiting beliefs around it,
24:47 - and they'll help you elevate.
24:48 - (engine revving)
24:55 - (exhaling sharply)
25:03 - All right, wow, we're getting a lot
25:05 - of good, quality questions.
25:06 - This is amazing, you guys.
25:08 - Would you quit your regular job
25:10 - if it meant getting a
machine learning job sooner?
25:15 - Putting in 10 hours a day
in something unrelated
25:17 - to my passion is such a waste of my time.
25:20 - Don't do it then.
25:21 - If it's not your passion, and
you're not gonna enjoy it,
25:23 - then, yeah, don't fuckin' do it.
25:27 - Not every dollar is equal, okay?
25:29 - So that's a very important concept.
25:31 - For example, let me ask you,
25:34 - if you're making $1,000
from coding a week,
25:39 - or a month let's say,
25:40 - and you're making $1,000
from driving an Uber,
25:44 - or driving a taxi, which one is better?
25:49 - Seriously, please take a second
25:50 - to answer that right now, okay?
25:53 - Which one is better,
25:54 - making $1,000 from programming
is better, okay, option A,
25:59 - or option B is better,
making $1,000 from taxi?
26:03 - Now I want you to answer another
question, very important.
26:06 - Which one is better,
26:07 - making $500 from programming, option A,
26:11 - or option B, making thousand
dollars from Uber, okay?
26:16 - Now I'm gonna tell you the answer.
26:19 - Hopefully, you took the time
to put it in chat right now.
26:24 - Doing programming and making $1,000
26:27 - is better than making $1,000
from doing taxi, all right?
26:31 - And like Ali Mo said, very awesome,
26:35 - $500 from programming is still
better than $1,000 from Uber.
26:40 - All right?
26:41 - Because one has what the
trajectory of your life,
26:46 - what you're gonna be doing, has no cap,
26:48 - scales infinitely, is in
line with your passion
26:51 - versus the other one is short-term,
26:54 - lizard brain type of thinking,
26:56 - which is what almost all of us do.
26:58 - I'm very guilty of it, too, all right?
27:01 - So please do something that falls in line
27:04 - with what you're gonna be doing,
27:05 - with the trajectory of your life.
27:07 - One of the things that
kills me is people like,
27:10 - "Oh, yeah, I wanna become
a really great programmer,
27:13 - "but in the meantime,
I'm working at Costco
27:17 - "at a cash register for 10 hours a day."
27:22 - I'm like, "What the fuck?
27:24 - "You're crazy, why are you doing that?"
27:26 - They're like, "We don't have any money."
27:27 - I'm like, "Okay, cool.
27:29 - "You don't have any money.
27:30 - "Why don't you in the
meantime, do something stupid,
27:33 - "like take out a credit card,
27:35 - "and start putting money on
that while you learn programming
27:37 - "and start to get a job."
27:38 - They're like, "It's too risky."
27:39 - I'm like, "Okay, I understand that.
27:40 - "Then why don't you learn programming,
27:44 - "and then go to platforms
like TakeLessons or Wyzant,
27:48 - "put up an ad that you can
teach Python to beginners,
27:53 - "complete beginners,
27:54 - "and you can teach them
things like Hello, World!
27:56 - "You can teach them
literally the same lessons
27:58 - "I teach on my YouTube in the free course
28:01 - "where I show you what a turtle is, okay?
28:03 - "I show you the definition
of a function in Python.
28:07 - "And then charge people $20
an hour, $30 an hour for that.
28:12 - "You'll have 10-year-old rich parents
28:14 - "who want their six-year-old
or 10-year-old kids
28:17 - "to learn how to program.
28:18 - "They'll pay you between
$20 to $60 an hour
28:20 - "happily without flinching.
28:22 - "Why don't you do that?"
28:25 - That way, you can still be
making money from programming,
28:28 - improving in programming,
it's in line with your future,
28:33 - and you don't have to
spend time doing Uber,
28:35 - something that's completely unrelated.
28:37 - So that's how I would answer
your question, Drue Staples.
28:41 - Try not to do something
28:42 - that's so out of your passion, all right?
28:49 - (sighs)
28:51 - Victor says, how do I get out
28:52 - of horrible cycle of procrastination?
28:54 - I feel like I'm afraid of success.
28:55 - Victor, great question.
28:57 - You should look into joining
Earn $1K with Python.
29:01 - That course is a lot about
destroying procrastination.
29:05 - And we actually destroy
it right in week one.
29:07 - We go pretty deep into this concept,
29:09 - and we have pretty insane
wins on our Instagram,
29:12 - people tagging us all the
time in how it's helping them.
29:15 - So I would suggest to send a email
29:18 - at support@cleverprogrammer.com
29:20 - with saying something
like earn $1K, all right?
29:25 - And say something with procrastination,
29:26 - so we know who you are.
29:32 - Shravan says, what's your job?
29:34 - Well, I do very little
freelancing with coding now.
29:38 - I was doing that a lot more.
29:39 - Now, I run this entire
business of Clever Programmer.
29:44 - I help programmers scale their income
29:46 - to six figures and beyond.
29:48 - We have tons of programmers
in our Profitable Shortcut
29:51 - who are making over $100,000 a year.
29:54 - And in that group, we're helping them go
29:57 - from $100,000 a year to
$200,000 a year, or beyond.
30:01 - So the goal of this entire
channel and what I do
30:05 - is I help entrepreneurs, okay,
30:09 - entrepreneurs become six-figure
developers, and beyond,
30:12 - entrepreneurs who believe
that there's more to life
30:15 - than just programming,
30:16 - entrepreneurs who believe
that there's more to life
30:19 - than just bare-minimum job security,
30:22 - because I am not interested
in helping people
30:26 - who just wanna get a
job for $40,000 a year,
30:28 - and then just have job security
for the rest of their lives.
30:31 - It doesn't interest me.
30:33 - It's not who I am.
30:34 - So I'm gonna stop trying
to please everybody.
30:37 - But people who are really
willing to work hard,
30:40 - go crazy, jump into it,
30:42 - and get insane results in a
much shorter amount of time,
30:45 - and want to actually have a
life where they have freedom,
30:48 - they can travel, they can
spend time with their families,
30:52 - they can pursue their hobbies,
30:54 - and at the same time, love
what they do like coding,
30:58 - and even have other
freelancers work for them
31:00 - where they can turn it into a business,
31:01 - then join me on this journey,
31:03 - and you're gonna be on
a very good path, okay?
31:05 - That's the goal of this channel.
31:07 - So we're becoming a lot more selective
31:10 - of who this is right for,
31:12 - because I think earlier, I
just wanted everybody to join,
31:14 - and then I realized there a
lot of just excuse makers,
31:17 - and it just sucks me of my energy.
31:19 - It's not mentally healthy
for me or my team,
31:22 - and it saps them of their energy, too.
31:24 - Even right now, what I
love about this live stream
31:26 - is we're getting such
high-quality questions,
31:28 - and I fucking love that,
31:30 - like intelligent thoughtful questions,
31:32 - and it also shows your
guys' level of hunger
31:36 - of how much you want it,
how much you wanna learn it.
31:39 - And if you give me your 100%,
31:40 - I will for all day and for all eternity
31:43 - be willing to give my 100%.
31:46 - And this year, the goal for me also
31:48 - is to do live events where
I meet you guys in person.
31:51 - I would make it free for you guys.
31:54 - But I wanna also know what
level of interest we have.
31:58 - But I would wanna hold it in
LA, 'cause I'm gonna be lazy,
32:02 - and I don't wanna travel anywhere else.
32:03 - But in LA, I would love
to hold a in-person event
32:07 - where we can do a masterclass.
32:09 - I can do a training around
programming, web development,
32:12 - or freelancing, or going as a entrepreneur
32:15 - to your six-figure developer mark.
32:17 - All of those things we can do,
32:18 - and have a really intensive
programming training.
32:22 - I think that would be really fun.
32:24 - But that's something we're trying
32:25 - to figure out if that's interested.
32:26 - Oh, Hager Mahmoud says,
32:28 - I can't believe you actually
mentioned me in your video.
32:30 - But please, I try to
create YouTube platform,
32:32 - and I learn Python and Django.
32:35 - Do I need something else?
32:36 - That's awesome.
32:37 - Hager, as you learn, keep making videos.
32:39 - That will be amazing.
32:40 - And you are most welcome.
32:42 - You're also so freaking awesome.
32:43 - That's why I mentioned you.
32:45 - Nik says, how do I get over anxiety?
32:48 - That's a very general question.
32:51 - But how I get over it is I
face it rather than feed it.
32:56 - So for example, if I have to give a talk,
33:01 - I will force myself to go and give a talk
33:04 - even if my hands are shaking
and I'm really nervous.
33:07 - Like I remember this one time,
my hands were shaking so bad,
33:09 - I wanted to hide in the bathroom
33:11 - and not give a talk two
minutes before my talk started.
33:14 - And then instead, I just
kinda pushed myself into it,
33:16 - and it was awkward, and I
was horrible, and it was bad,
33:20 - but then basically, I faced my fear,
33:24 - and I kinda had the worst
possible thing take place,
33:27 - and then it helped me overcome anxiety,
33:30 - and I didn't feel anxiety
anymore. (chuckles)
33:33 - So what I would suggest is,
33:36 - oftentimes, what I like to do
33:38 - is I'm a big believer of Stoic philosophy.
33:40 - So study Stoic philosophy.
33:42 - And in Stoic philosophy, the idea is that
33:46 - you wanna take a look at
the worst-case scenario
33:48 - and become comfortable with it.
33:50 - So what I like to do
is when I have anxiety,
33:53 - so let's say that you're afraid
33:56 - that your partner is gonna leave you.
33:59 - Let's say you're married, okay?
34:00 - So I'm just gonna come
up with this scenario.
34:02 - I'm not married, I don't have children.
34:04 - But let's say you come up with a scenario
34:05 - of your wife is gonna leave you.
34:07 - So then you start going deeper into it,
34:08 - and you're like, okay,
34:09 - she's gonna randomly just pack
up her stuff and leave me.
34:14 - I'm gonna lose 50% of all the
money that I've saved, okay.
34:17 - What else could get really bad?
34:19 - It could really hurt my children's future
34:22 - when it comes to education,
34:23 - and they can't go to
the colleges they want.
34:25 - What else will happen?
34:26 - The freedom I thought I
had, that would be lost.
34:30 - How else can it get worse?
34:32 - Okay, 10 years that I spent
with her would be lost,
34:36 - so that time, I can never get back.
34:38 - So you literally make
the, (chuckles) I do this.
34:42 - I literally make the list
34:43 - of the most horrendous
worst-case scenarios,
34:46 - bullet points, I'll write them all down.
34:50 - Oh, wow, that's awesome.
34:51 - Thank you, Bruce, for mentioning that.
34:53 - Stoic practice called
negative visualization.
34:55 - All right, I will not forget that ever.
34:57 - And thank you for jumping
on the live stream as well.
34:58 - So for me, it's I will do
negative visualization,
35:02 - I just learned it, and I'll
just go deep into it, okay?
35:05 - Super deep into it.
35:06 - And then, what I realize is that my fears
35:09 - are actually not so bad.
35:10 - I can actually just go
and check each fear off.
35:14 - By the way, guys, you should
follow How Communication Works.
35:16 - It's a great channel.
35:17 - And he makes videos on
how to overcome anxiety.
35:19 - He's a lot more fuckin'
intelligent than I am.
35:22 - He's a PhD, he's a
professor, he's a consultant.
35:24 - He is just a badass.
35:26 - He's a public speaker, he's unbelievable.
35:28 - So follow How Communication
Works YouTube channel,
35:31 - and he's in the chat here.
35:32 - And I actually just got off the call
35:34 - with him a little bit earlier.
35:35 - So let's go back to the
negative visualization.
35:39 - So I'll go through each
thing, and then I'll go, okay,
35:41 - 10 years of my time lost with my wife.
35:43 - That's actually not that
bad, because I learned a lot.
35:47 - I grew so much,
35:48 - and this is gonna help me
for the rest of my life.
35:51 - And I'm actually really excited
35:53 - about who my next wife is gonna be.
35:54 - That's pretty cool.
35:55 - Even though I love my wife,
35:56 - and I don't wanna lose her, all right?
35:59 - I would love to keep
her, but I'm just saying
36:02 - how I would deal with
the worst-case scenario.
36:04 - What's the other thing?
36:05 - My child's education could be jeopardized.
36:08 - That's okay, because that
just means I'm a little bitch.
36:11 - And I should've made more money,
36:13 - so then that shouldn't have
36:15 - jeopardized my child's education.
36:18 - So that's my weakness.
36:19 - Okay, so basically, I need
to work harder, work smarter,
36:23 - and actually have more income.
36:24 - So even if it's all lost,
36:26 - I have enough money to take care of that.
36:28 - What next?
36:29 - And I just keep going through the thing,
36:31 - and then at the end, what I find out
36:33 - is that anxiety is just
made up in my mind.
36:36 - And once I look at all
the fears in their face,
36:38 - and just open that Pandora's box,
36:40 - and open that closet where
the boogeyman is hiding,
36:43 - I'm like, this shit's easy.
36:45 - This is actually a lot of fun.
36:47 - If anything, it just seems
like a cool challenge.
36:49 - So for me, here's how I think.
36:52 - If a good thing happens, that's great.
36:54 - If a bad thing happens,
that's also amazing.
36:58 - And I just become stronger
and more resilient, all right?
37:03 - It's a weird way to think of it, about it,
37:05 - but that's how I think of it.
37:07 - All right, let's go
through more questions.
37:11 - ♪ Na na na, na na na na, na na ♪
37:14 - Shravan says, are you a programmer
37:15 - in Amazon or a high company?
37:17 - Nope, I'm not.
37:20 - (whistling)
37:22 - Prathibha says, hey,
automating stuff with Python,
37:24 - is that good?
37:25 - That's a really good book.
37:26 - And I'm actually gonna be making a course
37:28 - called How to Automate Stuff with Python,
37:29 - which is gonna be awesome.
37:33 - Ali Mo says, I'm from Skokie.
37:35 - Which meetup would you suggest?
37:36 - Are the meetup you went to still active?
37:38 - Go to PS1.
37:40 - P, PS1, okay?
37:45 - That's a really awesome coworking spot,
37:47 - and you'll meet a lot
of programmers there.
37:49 - It's local to Chicago.
37:56 - All right.
37:57 - ♪ Da da da da, da da da, da da da da ♪
38:00 - Going through more questions,
38:02 - and comments, and stuff
like that, let's see.
38:09 - Brandon Johnson says, I want
to be on your level, bro.
38:12 - I'm tired of spending my time
38:13 - at a place where I don't want to be.
38:15 - Awesome, Brandon.
38:16 - You should be very fuckin'
impatient and feel a lot of pain.
38:20 - Until you feel a lot
of pain where you are,
38:23 - and you don't feel like a loser,
38:25 - you will not change, all right?
38:29 - So going deep into how much you suck
38:32 - or how painful something
is is really great.
38:34 - It's called negative leverage.
38:35 - And it actually allows you to
then make a decision to change
38:40 - and never, ever go back.
38:43 - So I would encourage
you to go to that level.
38:47 - Don't go to that level where
you wanna like hurt yourself.
38:51 - But just know your own tolerance,
38:54 - and go to the level where you feel it,
38:57 - then you want to change, all right?
39:04 - Okay, let's see.
39:07 - Jeet says, I'm very excited
about all your videos.
39:09 - I'm learning Python by
teaching myself programming.
39:12 - However, can you advise
what projects can I work on
39:15 - to improve my skills in Python?
39:17 - Jeet, go through my
free programming course.
39:19 - It has almost all of
these answers there, okay?
39:23 - But you can also look up this question
39:25 - on Quora or something.
39:27 - So just find some
projects and work on them.
39:30 - ♪ Da na na na na ♪
39:33 - Chi-Town, bro, hell yeah, that's right.
39:35 - Brandon says, I've been waiting
for one of your live streams
39:39 - that I can actually can
catch, so let's do this, man.
39:42 - Cool, brilliant.
39:45 - Brandon, also emailed
me, that's really great.
39:47 - Awesome, man, excited about that.
39:50 - Yeah, Ali Mo, not plumping
station, Pumping Station.
39:54 - You know how like you pump gas,
39:56 - or you pump the brake?
(faucet water splashing)
39:58 - So it's pumping station.
40:11 - Okay, so Bruce, How
Communication Works, asks,
40:15 - what did chess teach
you about programming?
40:17 - (chuckles) I love this question,
40:19 - but one thing I also find funny about it
40:21 - is that a lot of people will
make so many correlations
40:24 - about chess and other
things that I do in life,
40:27 - like, "Oh, I bet when you're boxing,
40:31 - "because you're a chess player,
40:32 - "you probably think about
different moves, you know?
40:34 - "You're like, ooh, and then you go down."
40:37 - Or they'll say things like,
40:39 - "Oh, because you're good at chess,
40:41 - "it probably helps you with programming."
40:43 - And it's really funny.
40:44 - The really sad answer is
that it has taught me nothing
40:47 - about programming or boxing at all.
40:51 - They're kinda like unrelated.
40:52 - And I wish that they were related.
40:55 - But
41:00 - I don't know.
41:01 - Maybe it taught me to think
at a really deep level.
41:04 - What's up, Frankie?
41:06 - - [Aaron] I'm gonna actually--
41:06 - - Maybe it allowed me
to just be able to focus
41:09 - and think at a deeper
level, and analyze my lines.
41:15 - So I remember when I'd
be doing chess puzzles,
41:16 - I'd be like going through
lines very in-depth,
41:21 - and writing the analysis,
41:22 - like what happens in each variation.
41:24 - So in variation one, what happens?
41:25 - In variation two, what happens?
41:27 - So I guess you're right, you're right.
41:30 - It improved my logical thinking a lot.
41:32 - So if this, then what happens?
41:35 - And that carried over a
lot to my programming.
41:37 - It made me very analytical, factual,
41:42 - and it made my logical thinking
very, very, very precise.
41:46 - So yeah, actually, you're right, my bad.
41:49 - It did help a lot.
41:51 - It helped a lot, I just
didn't realize it. (chuckles)
41:59 - Ali Mo says, I'm typing too fast,
42:01 - 'cause I'm too excited for this live chat.
42:02 - That's awesome, I love that.
42:05 - I'm gonna give you your laptop.
42:07 - But if you can give--
42:08 - - [Aaron] No, I'll be back in two hours,
42:09 - just I didn't wanna interrupt
one of your questions.
42:10 - - So I can take your laptop?
42:11 - - [Aaron] Yeah, just leave it.
42:12 - I don't need it right now.
42:13 - - Okay, perfect.
- Yeah,
42:14 - I'll be back in an hour.
- Thank you, Aaron.
42:15 - - It won't be two hours.
- Really appreciate it.
42:16 - Everybody said bye to Aaron.
42:17 - Bye, Aaron.
42:18 - - [Aaron] See you, guys.
42:19 - - (laughs) He said, "See you, guys."
42:21 - Okay, cool.
42:28 - Joao Luis asks, how did
you started job hunting
42:31 - when you did freelancing?
42:35 - craigslist, meeting people, local meetups,
42:38 - stuff like that, massive action.
42:40 - Mickey, what are your
thoughts on blockchain,
42:41 - specifically, programmable
money like Ethereum?
42:44 - It's been a rabbit hole
and an aha moment for me.
42:47 - It's too hard for me to understand.
42:49 - But I do know I made $20,000
42:54 - from Ripple coin in one day.
42:58 - My friend and I put in $3,000.
43:01 - And I remember, we have this on Instagram,
43:04 - and every few seconds, we'd be like, "Ah."
43:07 - 'Cause we would refresh,
43:09 - and it would go from 3,000 to $4,000.
43:11 - Then we would refresh again,
it went from 4,000 to 5,000.
43:14 - Then we refreshed again, it
went from 5,000 to 8,000.
43:17 - And it went up to $27,000,
43:19 - and we literally just lost our mind.
43:22 - We were going crazy.
43:24 - And I don't know if you
guys remember him, Mustafa,
43:26 - he used to be on this channel
quite a bit a year ago.
43:31 - And we went all the way up to that,
43:35 - and then we were like, "Bro,
should we take this out?"
43:37 - And I'm like, "No, no."
43:38 - I'm like, "This is gonna go to the moon."
43:40 - And we just kept waiting.
43:42 - And then we refreshed, and it
went from 27,000 to 24,000.
43:46 - And then we're like,
"Should we take it out now?"
43:48 - We're like, "No, no, no,
it's gonna come back up."
43:50 - It went from 24,000 to 20,000.
43:52 - We kept waiting, from 20,000 to 18,000.
43:54 - And from 18,000 to 15, 15
to 12, and we were like,
43:57 - "Now, we might as well
just not take it out."
43:59 - And eventually, it went to like 5,000,
44:01 - and we finally took it out.
44:03 - So we made like $2,000,
44:06 - but if you're serious
about your investment,
44:09 - and you care about the money,
then don't put it in something
44:13 - unless you really, really,
really understand it,
44:16 - 'cause you're not gonna beat the market.
44:18 - So long-term investments
are good, you know?
44:20 - Put something in S&P 500.
44:24 - That thing is lifelong.
44:26 - It has shown through the history of time
44:28 - that it's a good investment to make.
44:30 - So Ray Dalio will tell you
to make that investment.
44:33 - Tony Robbins will tell you
to make that investment.
44:35 - So something like S&P 500,
44:37 - putting some amount of
money in there every month,
44:39 - that's a really good idea.
44:41 - But bitcoin and stuff,
I'm not playing around
44:45 - with that that much anymore.
(notification chimes)
44:49 - Okay, yup, chess also definitely
44:51 - taught me some patience as well.
44:53 - Oh, LOGAN BURNAU, I think...
44:56 - All right, so I think I remember, Richard,
44:59 - you told me that you like
the movie, Logan, so much
45:03 - that you named your son Logan.
45:06 - And I think LOGAN BURNAU is your son.
45:08 - So that's actually really cool.
45:11 - Logan says, I'm in high school,
45:12 - what's the best way to learn Python?
45:14 - Go through my free course,
LOGAN, Learn Python Programming.
45:17 - It's amazing.
45:22 - Clint says, what language would
you recommend after Python?
45:24 - I would say don't just, it's
like, if you learn English,
45:29 - then don't learn Japanese.
45:30 - Once you learn English, then get a job
45:35 - in a English-speaking place.
45:38 - Then find a English-speaking wife.
45:41 - And then, (chuckles) find a
gym where people speak English.
45:46 - And create English-speaking,
do English public speaking.
45:52 - Make English-speaking friends.
45:54 - So that's the next part, all right?
45:59 - Don't just learn a language,
46:00 - and then learn another language.
46:02 - Use the...
46:06 - Yeah, use it for its purpose.
46:07 - And then you can move on to
another language if you need it.
46:12 - What would be a good hourly rate
46:14 - to charge for tutoring programming?
46:16 - Start with $20 an hour, $15 an hour.
46:19 - So even if you suck at selling,
46:21 - you can have such a low
price that people will join.
46:23 - And then scale it up, okay?
46:26 - I've had sessions where I've taught chess
46:29 - to a five-year-old girl
46:31 - whose dad paid me $150
an hour to teach her.
46:35 - So you can go from $15 to $150 an hour.
46:41 - But 150's at the really high range,
46:44 - and 15, I would say, is
at a pretty low range.
46:51 - Oh, Clackening was just
learning Django right now,
46:54 - so that's actually really cool,
love that. (clears throat)
46:59 - Luis says, I'm really glad.
47:00 - Your Learning Python
Programming playlist is so good.
47:03 - Awesome, it is really damn awesome.
47:06 - Rich Burnau says, LOL, L-O-L.
47:08 - I didn't know he was listening
47:10 - to your live feed in his room.
47:11 - But yes, that's my son.
47:12 - (chuckles) Awesome, cool.
47:13 - So I made that connection very well.
47:18 - Francisco Alarcon says,
thanks for the insights.
47:22 - Awesome, he's sitting right there
47:23 - throwing in some fake comments
47:25 - to make the stream look like it's popping.
47:29 - Zephaniah,
47:32 - Zephaniah SefuOduori, I hope
I butchered your name, says,
47:36 - the English-speaking
analogy is very awesome.
47:38 - (laughs) Thank you.
47:42 - What other question?
47:46 - Clackening says, I don't
really care about data science.
47:48 - All I want to learn is back end Django.
47:50 - I'm a similar way, man.
47:51 - It's much easier to
start with data science
47:53 - than it is to start with Django.
47:55 - If I had to go and become a programmer,
47:58 - I would do web development,
get my foot in the door,
48:01 - start earning an income,
and then switch over,
48:05 - and in my own time, be
learning data science,
48:08 - and then get a data science job
48:10 - with years of experience
under my belt as a developer.
48:13 - I think that's a much easier
and better way to go about it.
48:17 - Shahzad says, do you think
about working on freelance sites
48:19 - on small projects such as
WordPress bugs, integration,
48:22 - and working on a lot of those projects?
48:24 - Yeah, those are great.
48:25 - You can be making a lot of money on those.
48:28 - I would say it like this.
48:30 - Go to local clients.
48:31 - Find web development projects.
48:34 - Then go on Upwork, hire freelancers,
48:40 - charge the client $1,000 to
deliver their result, all right?
48:45 - And then just be the middleman,
48:46 - and pay your freelancer $300, $200, $200.
48:50 - And if they're especially
in some other country
48:52 - other than United States,
they will be super happy.
48:55 - They'll love doing it.
48:56 - They're gonna be like...
48:59 - A lot of them don't feel
like they're privileged.
49:03 - They don't have the sense of entitlement.
49:05 - They're really hardworking people,
49:08 - and they're very reliable.
49:09 - So they'll do the project for you,
49:11 - and then you could be a
middleman, and manage it.
49:14 - And you get the customer what they want,
49:17 - and they win, the client wins.
49:18 - You get them a good, solid result.
49:22 - The person who's working for you wins,
49:23 - because you're helping them get work,
49:25 - and maybe even find consistent work.
49:27 - And then you are also winning,
49:29 - because you are just project managing,
49:32 - and you are collecting a
nice, profitable paycheck.
49:42 - Awesome.
49:43 - So
49:45 - that's pretty good for now, guys.
49:47 - We took a lot of questions.
49:49 - You guys had really, really good.
49:50 - Okay, I'm gonna actually take
Christine's last question.
49:54 - Would you recommend learning,
49:55 - 'cause my throat is like dying now.
49:57 - Would you recommend machine learning
49:59 - or AR/VR if your goal is
to freelance to clients
50:03 - slash start a software dev company?
50:06 - (bottle crinkles)
50:07 - Hmm.
50:10 - That's a tricky one.
50:11 - But I know a lot of successful
people who do VR personally.
50:14 - I don't many with AR.
50:16 - That's only because I don't know much
50:18 - about augmented reality.
50:20 - AR stands for augmented reality.
50:21 - VR is virtual reality.
50:22 - So I don't know much about AR.
50:24 - But for VR, I do know people
who are pretty successful.
50:28 - So
50:31 - I would say look into VR is really cool.
50:34 - So
50:38 - one of the people that I know,
50:39 - he's a really high-level person.
50:42 - His company's at a whole
another level than my company.
50:47 - And it probably making
over $10 million a year.
50:52 - And what he does is he has created,
50:56 - so they wanna train the military
people and train pilots.
51:01 - So training each pilot
51:04 - on how to ride a military
helicopter takes a lot of money.
51:10 - It's like $100,000, or $200,000,
or something per pilot,
51:14 - just really expensive.
51:17 - So what he did was he made
this virtual reality thing
51:21 - with his team where it
simulates a military helicopter.
51:27 - And now these pilots actually
get trained through VR.
51:35 - And all they have to pay is a very,
51:40 - they don't have to pay
that much at all anymore.
51:41 - So their cost went from
like $200,000 per pilot
51:46 - to say $5,000 per pilot to train.
51:49 - So that company's saving a lot of money.
51:53 - The government is saving a lot of money,
51:55 - and this company is making a lot of money.
51:57 - It's a very great business idea.
52:00 - So VR is a pretty awesome
thing to look into.
52:11 - Oh, sorry, guys.
52:12 - Yeah, my link isn't working.
52:14 - I know why.
52:15 - So just go to
cleverprogrammer.com, all right?
52:19 - Cleverprogrammer.com,
52:21 - because my other link is
broken in the description,
52:24 - so don't go to that one.
52:26 - Cleverprogrammer.com is
the one you gotta go to.
52:29 - Yup, Christine, you're welcome.
52:31 - For everybody else who wants to get more
52:32 - in touch with me one-on-one
like mm, like this,
52:36 - because there a lot less
people on my Instagram,
52:39 - and I love that human connection,
52:42 - that live one-on-one feeling,
52:43 - like I wanna see your
face right now, you know?
52:46 - This is cool, but I wanna see your face.
52:48 - I don't wanna, like Ali
Mo, I wanna see his face.
52:51 - Clackening, I wanna talk to him.
52:52 - Christine, I wanna get to know her.
52:54 - I wanna get to talk to you.
52:57 - Tyler messaged, like
Shawn, all these people,
52:59 - everybody's question that I answered,
53:01 - you're all cool people, and
I wanna get to know you,
53:03 - but I can't do that through YouTube.
53:05 - So if you follow me on
Instagram and message me,
53:08 - I can communicate with you through video.
53:10 - I can message you one-on-one, so do that.
53:13 - And then when you're coding,
53:14 - you can actually tag me
in what you're doing,
53:18 - and I love that.
53:19 - You could post it on your story,
53:20 - and tag me, and it notifies me,
53:21 - and then I can tag you
in my story, all right?
53:24 - And that, we could hold each other
53:25 - accountable to our own goals,
53:27 - and the things that we're
trying to do in life.
53:29 - So for all of you guys who
wanna take it to the next level,
53:31 - make yourself more accountable,
and just have more fun,
53:35 - and if you wanna help me feel more human
53:38 - by actually being in connection
with you instead of like,
53:42 - 'cause otherwise, it
just feels like a void,
53:43 - it feels like nothing,
53:45 - then go to my Instagram, and
add me @cleverqazi, okay?
53:51 - And message me there.
53:54 - Make sure you leave a message,
53:55 - and you say something like
you came from live stream.
53:57 - And let's just hang out there, all right?
54:00 - We can talk there.
54:01 - The things I don't like
are like desperate people,
54:04 - people asking like thoughtless questions,
54:07 - people trying to use me
54:08 - like a homework assignment, you know?
54:10 - Like hey, here's this
code, help me solve this.
54:13 - It's also not customer support.
54:16 - But if you're there,
54:18 - and you're either asking
a good, quality question,
54:20 - or you're a cool person,
and we're just hanging out,
54:23 - that's a lot of fun, it's exiting.
54:25 - And if you're coding,
54:27 - and you're just sharing
a picture of you coding,
54:29 - that's really cool.
54:31 - You're reading a book or something,
54:32 - and you were sharing that,
54:33 - and then I share that to
other people, that's fun, too.
54:36 - That's exciting.
54:37 - It'll keep you on track to you
doing your own coding stuff
54:40 - in your programming career,
54:42 - and also keeps me more motivated
seeing that you're winning.
54:45 - So really, my goal is
to have this small tribe
54:49 - of winners on Instagram,
54:50 - and then we communicate with each other.
54:58 - Hmm.
54:59 - Yeah, intelligence,
intellectual, and idealistic.
55:01 - I like that, triple I.
55:04 - All right, guys, thank you so much.
55:07 - I love your face.
55:09 - Follow me on Instagram, all right?
55:12 - And message me.
55:13 - Make sure to message me on Instagram.
55:15 - And other than that.
55:19 - I.
