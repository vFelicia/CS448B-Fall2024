00:00 - what do you feel like have been some of
00:01 - your biggest losses or biggest regrets
00:04 - most recently you know i had this
00:05 - company legal tech company called atrium
00:07 - we raised 75 million dollars didn't
00:08 - really work out spent most of the money
00:10 - returned some of it and obviously that's
00:12 - a lot of money
00:15 - [Music]
00:20 - what's up guys how's it going this is
00:22 - kazi from cleverprogrammer.com guys
00:24 - today it is absolutely insane we have
00:26 - the co-founder of twitch who sold it for
00:29 - almost a billion dollars to amazon and
00:32 - now he's moved on to doing a lot of web
00:34 - 3 stuff he's an investor and he's
00:36 - launching fractal and there's stuff with
00:38 - sin city there's a whole lot that we got
00:40 - to talk about but before i continue any
00:42 - further i'm just gonna shut my mouth
00:43 - justin welcome hey qazi what's up man
00:46 - thanks for having me i'm excited to be
00:47 - here yeah absolutely thank you man thank
00:50 - you i appreciate it um there's so much i
00:52 - want to talk about but i think like
00:54 - let's start talking about kind of what
00:56 - is going on with this web 3 world you
00:58 - know and
00:59 - what makes you interested in it yeah i
01:01 - mean so web 3 it's been around for a
01:03 - while right there's been a lot of people
01:04 - uh pushing it as a i guess it's not just
01:07 - a set of technologies but also i think
01:09 - philosophically how you design your app
01:11 - or community your project and
01:14 - it's been around for a while i've been
01:15 - kind of watching from the sidelines but
01:16 - really only jumped in in the past year
01:18 - and i think what happened what changed
01:20 - for me is that i finally saw the
01:22 - opportunity to really make applications
01:24 - that are more widespread consumer apps
01:26 - that a lot of people use and that's kind
01:28 - of what i'm i've been most excited about
01:30 - throughout my career you know so i'm uh
01:32 - in the past they start a lot of
01:33 - different web 2.0 apps yeah the one that
01:36 - people know about is twitch yeah and we
01:38 - sold that to amazon 2014 like you
01:40 - mentioned and then since then i've been
01:42 - investing in a lot of different startups
01:44 - and uh you know i finally feel like the
01:45 - technology for web3 is at the point
01:47 - where you can build these really
01:48 - interesting uh communities and
01:51 - applications that are based around
01:52 - communities you know yeah reward people
01:54 - for participating and that's what i'm
01:56 - really excited about that is exciting
01:58 - you know um something that's interesting
02:00 - is almost everything when i was looking
02:02 - at kind of what you were doing is really
02:05 - gaming related right like twitch became
02:07 - a gaming like big game streaming
02:09 - platform you're now launching fractal um
02:12 - since city the pro one of the projects
02:14 - that you were invested in i believe um
02:16 - that was related to yeah they changed
02:18 - their name to mob mob land right exactly
02:20 - yeah um so what what's up with this
02:22 - whole gaming thing you know what what
02:24 - made you interested in the first place
02:25 - and it feels like it's a pattern you
02:27 - know what's exciting to you about that
02:28 - well you know i always played games but
02:30 - i never set out to work in games yeah
02:33 - i'd always loved games when i was a kid
02:35 - i played you know hours and hours i mean
02:37 - i would spend all day playing games like
02:39 - what kind of games
02:40 - well
02:41 - many different ones uh you know when i
02:42 - played uh warcraft 2 i remember was one
02:44 - of the first nice i played that was yeah
02:46 - that was fun yeah have you ever played a
02:48 - frozen throne warcraft dude that's sick
02:51 - i grew up on that yeah that was an
02:52 - expansion of warcraft 3 right yeah
02:54 - warcraft 3 expansion yeah yeah so um
02:56 - play warcraft 2 warcraft 3 came out when
02:58 - i was in college i was playing that but
02:59 - i played a lot of 4x games you know like
03:02 - massive orion you know games like that
03:04 - like where there's like a you're
03:05 - building like civilization style games
03:07 - you know so i played civilization and i
03:09 - really love this game called
03:10 - colonization actually which is kind of
03:12 - like probably you know it'd probably be
03:14 - canceled today but it was like colonial
03:16 - style expansion of um
03:19 - of uh civilization where you're like you
03:21 - know one of the european empires uh
03:23 - discovering the new world yeah love that
03:25 - game and then i played a lot of world of
03:27 - warcraft a lot of mmos i loved ultima
03:29 - online that was like the first mmo i
03:30 - ever played i think that was the first
03:31 - mmo ever um so loved games throughout my
03:34 - you know one was young and then my early
03:36 - 20s and then um you know kind of fell
03:38 - into it accidentally when i was we
03:39 - started this the company that became
03:40 - twitch is this company called justin tv
03:42 - which was us trying to make our own live
03:44 - streaming show on the internet back in
03:46 - 2007 and this is before there was you
03:48 - know instagram live or facebook live or
03:50 - youtube live so you know we were we
03:53 - thought like live video was going to be
03:54 - a thing on the internet so we created
03:55 - our we want to create a show and then we
03:56 - created the show and it was kind of a
03:58 - splash but people didn't it was really
03:59 - boring like our content sucked you know
04:01 - i wasn't like you guys or anything i was
04:03 - like you're just programmers trying to
04:04 - make something happen i guess i was kind
04:06 - of like you but like i wasn't as
04:07 - entertaining you know it's like um we
04:10 - ended up uh turning that into a platform
04:12 - for live video called justin tv yeah we
04:14 - launched that in 2007 and then uh that
04:17 - pivoted to become twitch about four
04:18 - years later and um uh then you know that
04:21 - was kind of like how it got started that
04:22 - was about 11 years ago twitch kind of
04:24 - came into existence got it amazing yeah
04:27 - and i i kind of understand your journey
04:28 - of like what got you into gaming now
04:30 - you're continuing on that trend right so
04:33 - why because there's so many different
04:34 - fields you could go into so you know
04:36 - what made you go into and stick with
04:38 - gaming still well i've actually tried a
04:40 - lot of different startups in all these
04:42 - different areas you know i've started uh
04:44 - i've helped start a you know pharmacy
04:46 - startup i've helped i've done like a
04:48 - legal startup we're like a
04:49 - lot of different online offline
04:51 - companies and as an investor i've
04:52 - invested in everything from sas software
04:54 - to self-driving cars to synthetic
04:57 - biology like all sorts of different
04:59 - fields so i'm always curious about new
05:01 - things i'm constantly curious about new
05:02 - areas of innovation yeah um but gaming
05:05 - is like one that's just constantly been
05:07 - fun you know i've always been curious
05:09 - and interested about gaming obviously
05:10 - it's something that i personally have
05:12 - enjoyed and throughout my life and so uh
05:15 - i think when i saw you know this year
05:17 - when i was thinking about web 3 startups
05:18 - to start uh i kind of came up with a
05:20 - there were a couple ideas and one of
05:22 - them was you know to build something in
05:24 - nfts and you know nfts my friend dave
05:26 - was like hey we should we should build
05:28 - something in fts uh he had been
05:30 - interested in investing in nfts for a
05:32 - couple of months and um and then i was
05:34 - like well the next thing is going to be
05:35 - clearly game related assets you know
05:38 - games like the stuff you buy in games
05:39 - because that already exists you know if
05:40 - you look at free fire or fortnite or any
05:42 - of these games out there called i mean i
05:44 - used to play borderlands dude and i
05:45 - would like buy so much [ __ ] in
05:47 - borderlands or like fifa you know i
05:49 - spent hundreds of dollars almost
05:51 - thousand dollars like buying packs where
05:53 - i'm like i hope i get messy you know and
05:54 - then you get these collectibles like yes
05:56 - so you're exactly you're already buying
05:58 - stuff in games right like you are like
06:00 - you're one of the you know hundreds of
06:02 - millions of people who are buying stuff
06:03 - in games right now this is something
06:04 - that people already do yeah and so the
06:06 - idea that you're going to create that we
06:08 - could create real ownership of those
06:10 - things and then people could take those
06:12 - you know real ha really have ownership
06:13 - and after they're done with the game
06:15 - they can trade them they can sell them
06:16 - they can borrow against it they can do
06:17 - whatever they want with them that's i
06:19 - think a kind of a next level that really
06:21 - opens up the economy of these games and
06:23 - once games do that i think it will be
06:25 - pretty obvious that it's it's better for
06:27 - both parties in the game both the game
06:28 - developers and the players i was i was
06:30 - like this is gonna be the future let's
06:31 - just you know i was like i was convinced
06:33 - it was going to be future i was like
06:34 - let's yeah start this so we we ended up
06:36 - incubating you know creating this
06:38 - company fractal and uh fractal is uh you
06:40 - know a platform for players to discover
06:42 - buy and sell gaming assets gaming nfts
06:45 - inside of their games got it you know
06:47 - something that's that that like popped
06:49 - into my mind and it like excited me to
06:51 - ask you this question is i have founded
06:54 - one company clever programmer this one
06:57 - and i've been just working on growing it
06:58 - right for the last half half a decade
07:01 - and there have been moments that have
07:02 - been incredibly humbling and like the
07:05 - failures were so freaking hard went
07:07 - through so much stress right even like
07:08 - maybe last year there were times where i
07:09 - lost so much weight stress count
07:12 - sleeping was difficult right and then um
07:14 - gotta support the team financial there's
07:16 - so many things where your ambition kind
07:18 - of like goes like this up and down where
07:20 - you're like i'm gonna take over the
07:21 - world and it's gonna be the number one
07:22 - country uh company in the world and then
07:24 - you're like guys we have seven days
07:25 - runway i hope we can just get to like
07:27 - ten right so like when i think about you
07:30 - and i'm i'm trying to just think from
07:32 - your perspective you have way more
07:33 - experience you've been doing this for a
07:34 - lot longer yes you've had successes but
07:37 - you've also had heartbreaking failures
07:39 - so how do you still feel that level of
07:41 - confidence to go okay we can build this
07:44 - big thing um you know where does that
07:46 - come from well i think i've always had
07:49 - this excitement and exuberance for new
07:51 - ideas
07:53 - i'm an enthusiast i don't know if you've
07:54 - ever done any gram but i've done an
07:56 - enneagram and i'm a type 7 which is the
07:58 - enthusiast and it's you know i'm all
08:00 - about new experiences discovering new
08:02 - things and i like i love new ideas i
08:04 - love learning about new ideas and so for
08:06 - me a lot of the starting of a company
08:08 - you know you know you're an entrepreneur
08:10 - you know what it's like i've had those
08:11 - times too it's like i've had the
08:12 - horrible times i didn't want to get out
08:13 - of bed it was like this is not working i
08:15 - was like i've had the times when i felt
08:16 - like i've let everyone around me down or
08:18 - my employees or my investors you know
08:20 - i've
08:21 - raised 75 million for a company and
08:22 - burned most of it like
08:24 - failed you know so that's scary
08:26 - obviously yeah there's like the big
08:28 - successes like you read about like the
08:30 - twitch or you know other companies i'm
08:32 - invested in or whatever but then there's
08:34 - like a lot of failures in there too and
08:35 - i talk about that on my youtube channel
08:37 - i'm like very public about that yeah i
08:38 - saw that video i think yeah it's not
08:40 - about it's not just about be you know
08:42 - every like always winning right like
08:44 - nobody has a life where they're like
08:45 - winning 100 of the time you know and so
08:47 - yeah um for me it's important to talk
08:49 - about that and and for me though the
08:51 - entrepreneur the seat of
08:52 - entrepreneurship comes from that like
08:53 - for me it's like my creative spark i
08:55 - love to learn about something i love new
08:57 - ideas and so the idea of like oh how
08:59 - could this idea become something in the
09:01 - world right yeah how could i um i have
09:03 - this idea for a new product or a new
09:06 - service how could it become something in
09:07 - the world and i started thinking about
09:08 - like what's the strategy for how we
09:09 - would build it how would design it i
09:11 - would market it you know all those
09:12 - things it's a very cross-functional
09:14 - learning for me you know because it's
09:15 - it's everything from you know uh
09:18 - technology and design and engineering to
09:20 - like the marketing component of it
09:21 - communications and like the psychology
09:23 - of like how people buy things and then
09:25 - like to economics of like you know and a
09:27 - business and like to me it's fun
09:30 - entrepreneurship is fun yeah it's my
09:32 - it's my hobby and so in the start i have
09:34 - like this creative energy and then it's
09:36 - like okay once you start it you know
09:38 - there's a lot of excitement and then you
09:39 - have the reality of okay now i have to
09:40 - run this company yeah like i gotta like
09:42 - keep going yeah and then there's a lot
09:44 - of like real the real world hits and
09:46 - there's like pain and like oh you hired
09:47 - the wrong person or
09:49 - is legal yeah the clients left because
09:52 - they you know there was some there was a
09:54 - problem or you didn't weren't able to
09:55 - deliver something or whatever and then
09:56 - yeah you know obviously that part is the
09:58 - tough part so in the in the beginning i
10:00 - would say in the first part of my career
10:01 - i usually had a lot of energy for the
10:03 - spark and didn't have that much energy
10:04 - for the like hard operational part yeah
10:07 - and i i would get discouraged and i
10:08 - think i had to you know i was best off
10:10 - when i partnered with someone else who
10:12 - was really good at that part
10:13 - today i think it's still the same i have
10:15 - a lot of energy for that spark but i
10:16 - also like i'm a lot calmer like i don't
10:19 - have a need for it to turn out any sort
10:21 - of certain way you know i seem like more
10:23 - like i used to have a lot of like this
10:24 - has to be a billion dollar company
10:26 - because my friend has a billion dollar
10:28 - company in my whole life i want to be as
10:29 - good as my friend and i think i'm like
10:30 - you know i had a lot of ego around it it
10:32 - was like very driven by external
10:33 - motivations and today i would say i've
10:35 - really embraced internal motivations of
10:37 - like hey what am i do what do i do that
10:39 - i really love to do every day yeah it's
10:40 - like what gives me joy right you know
10:42 - maybe it's working on a product maybe
10:44 - it's recruiting someone maybe it's
10:45 - pitching someone on my new idea you know
10:47 - it's probably some set of those things
10:48 - you know and then like can i just do
10:50 - that every day and then if i do it is
10:52 - that success you know like it doesn't
10:54 - really matter how much this company ends
10:55 - up being worth because like i've got to
10:57 - live my life in a way that i really
10:58 - enjoy yeah so uh do you think how i view
11:00 - it now and go ahead yeah and it's it's
11:02 - like a little bit like it it takes the
11:04 - pressure off you know so even when
11:05 - things aren't going that well it's like
11:07 - okay well i still had a good day you
11:08 - know i i can understand that now okay
11:10 - from somebody's perspective when they
11:12 - look at this they go easy for you to say
11:13 - because you've already exited and have
11:15 - built a billion dollar company so do you
11:17 - think it was like a philosophical switch
11:20 - that you had to make or because you've
11:21 - hit that goal you're like now i have
11:24 - nothing to prove and it's easier for you
11:25 - well well actually i know it was the
11:27 - former because one if you know when i
11:30 - started in off and i remember starting
11:31 - justin tv i was like if i could make a
11:33 - million dollars off of tech then i'd be
11:35 - set
11:36 - right and obviously i kind of blew past
11:38 - that goal that was my dream i blew past
11:39 - it and then we sold the company for like
11:40 - 970 million dollars and then i was still
11:43 - i remember i was after like a week for a
11:44 - week i was like that's awesome after a
11:46 - week i was like okay now what and then
11:47 - after a month i was like bored and
11:49 - aggravated and i was like i need to do
11:51 - something and i
11:53 - looked at my friends and my friends had
11:54 - started companies like dropbox or airbnb
11:56 - and i was like i didn't do that good
11:58 - actually i have like other friends who
11:59 - did better and so then i was like really
12:01 - driven to start another company and make
12:03 - it even bigger i was like what can be a
12:05 - 10 billion dollar company right yeah and
12:07 - so then and i was like torturing myself
12:09 - the whole time like oh i didn't do good
12:10 - enough i'm like not you know so i was
12:12 - very dissatisfied i would say despite
12:14 - like obviously having a tremendous
12:15 - amount of material wealth like just
12:17 - dumped in my lap right so yeah it was
12:19 - only later when i like made internal
12:21 - changes i would say and like
12:22 - philosophical changes um that i was like
12:24 - oh actually it's all good like i've got
12:27 - enough and i'm like happy you know and
12:29 - it wasn't about it really wasn't i mean
12:31 - it's easy you know people be like oh
12:32 - it's easy for you to say it's like it
12:33 - wasn't really about the amount of
12:34 - material things or anything like that it
12:37 - was there was more about a mindset shift
12:38 - wow and so you could have that mindset
12:40 - shift at any time but what how did that
12:42 - mindset shift come for you like what
12:45 - what were there particular things that
12:46 - you did to have that mindset shift
12:48 - because it's something i struggle with
12:50 - right as an entrepreneur where i'll just
12:52 - give you our example right a few months
12:54 - ago we had like uh we were like oh my
12:56 - god if we can take the seven day runway
12:58 - to like 30 and we're bootstrapped so we
13:00 - don't have any funding yeah we can take
13:02 - the seven day runway to 30 days i'm like
13:04 - justin that is like the best thing ever
13:06 - you know and i was like literally would
13:08 - cry out of happiness but now in the last
13:10 - months we're really like we figured out
13:13 - a new business model and we've closed
13:15 - enough deals where we have almost two
13:17 - years of runway we've like partnered up
13:19 - with some really big companies in the
13:20 - web 3 space actually and when that
13:22 - happened it's like i was really excited
13:24 - but then it normalized again and i'm
13:26 - like what the [ __ ] like this is my
13:28 - normal runway yeah i'm like i should
13:29 - feel way more excited like the
13:30 - excitement shouldn't stop i'm like what
13:32 - is this is like was kind of frustrating
13:34 - to be honest because now i'm like
13:35 - thinking how do i make it more than two
13:37 - years you know what i mean like how do
13:38 - you did you fight that and did you ever
13:40 - have to figure out like how to be truly
13:43 - just [ __ ] grateful and like love
13:44 - every moment or is that a fight you
13:46 - fight today yeah so
13:48 - no that's i mean it's well obviously so
13:50 - that's the hedonic treadmill right like
13:52 - yeah yeah it's no matter where you're at
13:54 - there's always something next and then
13:56 - you're like when you get that thing
13:57 - that's the next thing and then after
13:58 - that the next thing and so you know like
14:00 - when i was a kid i had this i remember i
14:02 - wanted this toy it was like some sort of
14:04 - like medieval gi joe or something like
14:06 - that and um i was like if i get this
14:08 - thing that's the last toy i'll ever need
14:11 - how old are you it's like i don't know i
14:13 - was like ten nine days or something like
14:16 - if i get this toy it's like the last toy
14:17 - i'll ever need i've got it for my
14:19 - parents bought it for me and then after
14:20 - a week i was like i'm bored with it you
14:22 - know and i saw i remember that entire
14:24 - arc and that's like the same thing with
14:25 - you and me right that's like oh i sell
14:27 - this company for a billion dollars is
14:28 - the last thing i'll ever need yeah like
14:30 - if i just get two years of runway then
14:32 - that's the last thing i'll ever need and
14:33 - then next boom no that's not enough like
14:36 - now i need to get more i want to grow my
14:37 - team whatever it is like the next thing
14:39 - around the corner pops up so that's a
14:40 - human condition so the first thing is
14:42 - like to realize like that's not bad
14:44 - that's the human that's part of being a
14:45 - human being is to have this hedonic
14:47 - drive for more and it's because you grew
14:49 - up you evolved right human beings your
14:51 - ancestors and it was involved in an
14:52 - environment that was a scarce
14:53 - environment yeah right where it's like
14:55 - actually good for you to have more if
14:56 - you had like x amount of food you wanted
14:58 - 2x because you're like i don't know when
14:59 - the next meal is coming so we got a
15:01 - stockpile yeah yeah that's like human
15:03 - nature right yeah so to understand
15:05 - because a lot of people are like why am
15:07 - i so greedy why am i so selfish why do i
15:10 - think it's like an evolutionary thing
15:11 - like even the jealousy and getting upset
15:14 - that your friend is winning over you
15:15 - like for example how you were like hey
15:17 - my friend launch dropbox is like
15:19 - from an evolutionary perspective maybe
15:21 - it's a good thing because then it makes
15:22 - you want to kind of step up but it
15:24 - doesn't feel good internally all the
15:26 - time exactly exactly that's exactly
15:27 - right so it's evolutionary so you could
15:29 - just say i accept that about myself you
15:30 - know i'm a person that's a human being
15:33 - and that part of that is that i want
15:35 - more yeah there's part of me that wants
15:37 - more and then for me it was a process of
15:39 - stepping back and like doing a lot of
15:41 - things to retrain my mind right so for
15:43 - example like being grateful for what you
15:45 - have is obvious is like correlated with
15:48 - being happy right yeah so you can
15:49 - practice that like just like anything
15:51 - else like so every day i have a
15:53 - gratitude journal app i open this app i
15:54 - write down three things i'm grateful for
15:56 - that's how i start every day got it you
15:57 - know sometimes i like actually just
15:58 - write a ton of things i'm grateful for
16:00 - i've sat down and written list of 50
16:01 - things i was grateful for because like
16:03 - then you're practicing the path you know
16:05 - your neural pathways that are focused
16:06 - around like gratitude and you know
16:09 - that's that's a way to like
16:10 - contextualize hey like actually i have a
16:13 - lot yeah i don't mean i have a lot in
16:15 - the material senses like i have a lot in
16:16 - like the sense of i have a lot of uh you
16:19 - know
16:19 - love in my life or family or opportunity
16:21 - or like relationships you know so that's
16:23 - one thing i mean i meditate also every
16:25 - day you know do a meditation to like
16:27 - really understand the you know even just
16:29 - your experience so like for me i'm like
16:30 - feeling oh i feel upset right now that i
16:33 - didn't you know this thing happened like
16:35 - i wanted to close this deal and then
16:36 - they like the client disappeared or
16:38 - whatever right like and then i'll be
16:40 - like
16:41 - in the past i would be swept along by
16:42 - that it'd be like
16:43 - what the [ __ ] yeah
16:45 - yeah like i must have [ __ ] this thing
16:47 - up or i should have done this i'm so
16:49 - stupid i should have like pitched them a
16:50 - different way or whatever yeah but now
16:52 - i'm like seeing that but through the
16:54 - practice of meditation it's like oh i
16:55 - see this thought pop up that's like oh
16:57 - wow that really you know that sucks
17:00 - and then i'm like just observing it and
17:01 - you're observing the qualities of mind
17:03 - the things that happen in your mind and
17:04 - then they just float along right like
17:06 - i'm more able today to like instead of
17:08 - being in the river and swept along to be
17:09 - on the banks of the of the river but the
17:11 - full point is that you still have those
17:13 - thoughts right those intrusive thoughts
17:14 - that are like oh i'm i [ __ ] this up
17:16 - i'm stupid or something like that it
17:17 - still pops up but you're not as engaged
17:19 - in them you're not as necessarily swept
17:21 - along with them you know this is that's
17:22 - another technique oh yeah good yeah go
17:24 - go go if you want then like there's lots
17:26 - more i mean i've i can do therapy i've
17:27 - done therapy you know like i have like a
17:30 - lot of there's a lot of physiological
17:32 - things you can do to make yourself more
17:34 - at peace like when you are in the state
17:36 - like if you are in a state where you're
17:38 - triggered by something you're like
17:39 - obsessed you're upset because you you
17:41 - know lost a deal or whatever and you
17:42 - notice it now instead of like being
17:44 - subconscious you're like conscious about
17:46 - it you know i work out a lot or go for a
17:48 - walk whatever i mean simple stuff really
17:50 - but really that's the that's that's it's
17:52 - funny i mean all this money in the world
17:54 - and like that's the [ __ ] that makes me
17:55 - happy you know what it's funny is that
17:57 - it i feel relatable to you
18:00 - you know because
18:02 - i
18:02 - um because i haven't met you up until
18:05 - today i'm you know it's not justin it's
18:08 - the founder of twitch or the xyz or
18:11 - running this thing and you know it's
18:13 - like because we're all operating on
18:15 - different levels and since i judge
18:17 - myself because i'm an entrepreneurial
18:19 - game right entrepreneurial race so i
18:21 - judge it based on levels right you're
18:22 - like the [ __ ] you're playing in the
18:24 - olympics um and i'm like winning a high
18:27 - school championship and i'm like all
18:28 - right you know i'm gonna be there but
18:31 - speaking with you i feel leveled and
18:33 - connected because when you share how
18:36 - you're feeling and you know you're
18:37 - having frustrations and you're feeling
18:39 - envy from your friends i'm like those
18:40 - are feelings i've felt you know uh
18:43 - you're feeling like you've lost or or
18:44 - certain things felt like a win or
18:46 - focusing on gratitude i'm like those
18:47 - things feel like the things i feel and
18:49 - my friends feel uh i think i can get
18:51 - justin you know so that's actually
18:52 - really um
18:54 - really cool i think you know for you i
18:56 - guess like when you were when you're
18:57 - doing all this stuff and working on
19:00 - yourself for me one of the big problems
19:02 - that happens is i will put i'll still
19:04 - end up putting business above health and
19:06 - things like that by mistake kind of you
19:08 - know in my mind i'm like after this one
19:10 - deal is done or after this is done then
19:12 - i will go to the gym and then i will do
19:13 - these other things have you made it a
19:15 - priority or kind of non-negotiables in
19:17 - your life like this is what i do and
19:19 - this is how i take care of my physical
19:20 - and mental health and then i do all the
19:22 - you know material success stuff yeah
19:24 - absolutely i've like i so you know i
19:27 - there's a set of things that it's like
19:28 - i'm gonna do it every day no matter what
19:31 - like that's more
19:32 - higher priority than work and it's i
19:35 - still work a lot actually right now i
19:36 - probably work you know 10 hours a day
19:38 - yeah i wouldn't be surprised eight to 10
19:40 - hours a day but like it's like every day
19:43 - i'm gonna you know maybe less than that
19:44 - actually you know to be honest it's
19:46 - probably probably like eight hours a day
19:47 - right like i don't wanna i don't need to
19:48 - work martyr myself but i think i'm
19:50 - working eight hours a day but i like it
19:51 - you know yeah being on you know i'm
19:53 - doing stuff that i love making content
19:54 - i'm like you know building new products
19:56 - you know stuff that i love so it doesn't
19:57 - feel like work but um i uh i think the
20:00 - the main point is like you know every
20:02 - day i'm gonna do my gratitude journal
20:03 - every day i'm gonna work out if it's
20:05 - just five minutes you know it's not
20:07 - necessarily an hour but i'm gonna like
20:09 - start with five minutes and then it
20:10 - usually is more than that you know i'm
20:11 - gonna every day i'm gonna meditate um
20:13 - every day i'm gonna spend time with my
20:14 - family like that stuff is like if i
20:16 - don't do that i'm not gonna be my most
20:18 - effective
20:19 - so to me it's it's you know just a
20:20 - matter of efficiency right like it's
20:22 - like i clearly am a much more productive
20:25 - and like much better person and boss
20:28 - yeah like when i have taken care of
20:30 - myself yeah so i'm gonna do those things
20:32 - yeah i think that's true a lot of people
20:34 - think that they're not they're like oh
20:36 - if i if i spend time meditating or i
20:38 - spend time exercising i'm not working
20:40 - but it's like you know if you go into a
20:42 - work situation and you're triggered
20:43 - because you didn't take care of yourself
20:45 - or you could have alleviated that
20:46 - situation of being triggered because you
20:48 - like you know by taking care of yourself
20:50 - yeah then you could actually be negative
20:52 - in that situation you know i've had so
20:53 - many situations at work like with other
20:55 - people where i've like probably created
20:56 - a negative environment because i was
20:58 - like in a bad head space maybe
20:59 - misdirected anger and [ __ ] like that
21:01 - yeah or just making decisions like that
21:03 - were the wrong decisions yeah i agree
21:06 - and you know alex for moses i don't know
21:07 - if you know him or not but uh he's
21:09 - blowing up on youtube as well he's uh um
21:11 - he's also growing his channel on the
21:13 - entrepreneurial space and he sold his
21:15 - company recently um but he talks a lot
21:17 - about as you start kind of leveling up
21:20 - um you know it goes from you know it
21:23 - goes from actions you take to the
21:24 - decisions you make and so the decisions
21:26 - start becoming more important than the
21:27 - actions and so in order to make good
21:29 - decisions then you have to be mentally
21:31 - and emotionally in a really good space
21:33 - to be able to do that so if you're
21:35 - spending time with friends family
21:36 - whoever really matters to you you're
21:37 - going to be less likely to you know
21:40 - misdirect one of the people on your team
21:42 - or lead them the wrong way or be
21:44 - irritated or agitated quicker now what
21:47 - are you know um for you what do you feel
21:49 - like have been some of your like biggest
21:51 - losses or biggest regrets that you've
21:54 - experienced you know over over the years
21:58 - well i have a lot of losses but i don't
21:59 - really have regrets um because like
22:01 - everything even the things that were
22:02 - difficult i think you know i learned
22:04 - something from them i got something out
22:05 - of it like most recently you know i had
22:07 - this company legal tech company called
22:09 - atrium we raised 75 million dollars
22:10 - didn't really work out spent most of the
22:12 - money returned some of it uh it was kind
22:14 - of like a fiery crater in the ground
22:15 - right like a startup and obviously
22:17 - that's a lot of money right like 75 mil
22:19 - so
22:20 - what happens when you lose that money
22:21 - like for a normal person to understand
22:23 - like do you lose relationships and
22:25 - friendships over that
22:26 - does it have you know more consequences
22:28 - i was very supported by our investors
22:30 - and they were like it's okay and like
22:32 - you know people who are good technology
22:33 - investors know it's a numbers game and
22:35 - they're investing in a portfolio and
22:36 - some of them aren't going to work out
22:37 - you know
22:38 - unfortunately obviously you don't want
22:39 - to be the one that didn't work out but
22:41 - like everybody moves on like these com
22:42 - funds have raised billions of dollars
22:44 - they're like gonna be fine yeah all my
22:46 - employees got other jobs like even if i
22:48 - thought it was like horrible at the time
22:50 - and it was difficult but everybody got a
22:52 - new job they got most of them got jobs
22:54 - they liked better
22:56 - they you know everyone who worked at the
22:57 - company everybody who like all the
22:59 - investors are fine they've like
23:01 - you know 20 20 that a year we shut down
23:04 - yeah you know 2021 was like the best
23:06 - year for tech in like a decade right
23:08 - like so it's just like people were fine
23:10 - afterwards and so at the end of the day
23:12 - it wasn't that bad um but obviously it
23:14 - was difficult and obviously if i could
23:16 - go back in time i'd probably start a
23:17 - different company i wouldn't start the
23:18 - same company but i don't have a regret
23:20 - over starting it because through that
23:22 - difficulty you know in the difficult
23:23 - experience i actually learned a lot of
23:25 - the practices i'm talking to you about
23:26 - now like how to live my joy every day
23:28 - and like just how to focus on the
23:30 - intrinsic motivations instead of the
23:31 - extrinsic and so for me it was valuable
23:33 - you know even the things that like are
23:34 - difficult or like that don't that that
23:37 - are that are tough or you know end up
23:38 - being valuable 100 in some way i love it
23:41 - let's switch over to why web3 because i
23:43 - think we haven't touched base on that
23:45 - right that's what he wanted to talk
23:46 - about yeah yeah yeah on the rabbit hole
23:48 - no no i love everything that we've
23:50 - talked about i yeah i'm okay with that
23:52 - because i think it brings like i feel
23:54 - like it brought me value i know they're
23:55 - gonna be other people it's gonna bring
23:56 - value to so that's huge
23:58 - uh so thanks for sharing that and so
24:00 - open-heartedly sharing that you know i i
24:02 - do want to touch a base a little bit on
24:04 - web 3 because i'm personally curious and
24:05 - i know a lot of my community is curious
24:07 - why
24:08 - web 3 like why did you jump into it you
24:11 - know uh you've already built successful
24:13 - companies in the web 2 space you know
24:14 - maybe you might want to just continue on
24:16 - that trend right but what made you take
24:18 - a leap and jump into it yeah so i'll
24:20 - just start with here's my story of me in
24:22 - web 3 right like my participation i
24:25 - started off when i was you know
24:27 - in 2013 i was like saw bitcoin and i was
24:30 - like i should buy some bitcoin because
24:32 - like if this thing works the fomo is
24:34 - going to kill me if i don't own any so
24:35 - uh because there was like so much you
24:36 - know it's in silicon valley friends of
24:38 - mine were talking about i was like i
24:39 - should just buy some bitcoin so i bought
24:40 - some bitcoin and then it immediately
24:42 - crashed
24:43 - and i was like i'm the bag holder i'm an
24:45 - idiot wow then it kind of like i forgot
24:47 - about it for years years then it kind of
24:49 - went up again and then at that point
24:51 - like there's you know ethereum and i'm
24:52 - like i don't get ethereum so i like
24:54 - invested in a crypto fund to like invest
24:57 - in
24:57 - crypto you know positions and then i was
24:59 - like okay i'm in this fund and then i
25:02 - can just not worry about it and then it
25:04 - was only this last year where i was like
25:05 - finally like checking out web3 again
25:07 - like a year ago i'm like okay and then
25:09 - i'd invest in a couple companies but
25:11 - like i didn't really you know i was like
25:12 - i don't know if any of this stuff is
25:14 - going to work yeah so i was checking out
25:15 - web3 again i was like i went to the site
25:17 - audience.com it's like a friend of mine
25:19 - site that i was i was like an advisor to
25:20 - this company and they like spotify on
25:22 - blockchain right yeah it's like
25:23 - blockchain music right so like spotify
25:26 - or soundcloud and what i was like you
25:29 - could use the app and it's all powered
25:30 - in a decentralized way without the user
25:33 - ever knowing it right you don't have to
25:35 - like log in with metamask or anything
25:37 - like that just like use this app and
25:38 - it's like it was actually easy and i'm
25:40 - like this is actually pretty good right
25:43 - like it actually works and so that made
25:44 - me interested in like what could you
25:46 - build on top of this and then my other
25:47 - friend that started this company called
25:48 - brain trust as a project and they
25:50 - basically created decentralized upwork
25:52 - and by decentralizing you know they by
25:55 - by creating this token they were able to
25:57 - distribute it to a hundred thousand
25:58 - people who are freelancers and like
26:00 - create a marketplace out of nothing
26:01 - right but you know to compete with
26:03 - upwork because they were you know they
26:05 - they just like had this incentive right
26:07 - they created an incentive through this
26:09 - community token and so to me it the
26:12 - light bulb went off and i was like oh
26:13 - this is a great way to create it's not
26:15 - just about the technology of the
26:17 - trustless part but it's also about
26:19 - galvanizing a community towards a
26:20 - certain goal yeah right which is kind of
26:22 - what you see with like these creator
26:23 - dows and like all these different dials
26:25 - like links down stuff like that it's
26:26 - like creating community around a
26:28 - specific goal and you could have done it
26:30 - without web three yeah but the
26:33 - decentralization is part of like the
26:35 - ethos that gives people the trust i
26:37 - think to like you know believe in this
26:39 - mission and like kind of that that there
26:41 - is that they will be able to participate
26:43 - in the value of creation right yeah and
26:45 - so to me that was like that the the the
26:48 - light bulb went off and i was like this
26:49 - is how if we were making twitch again
26:51 - today we would do it as a decentralized
26:54 - project um
26:56 - to galvanize this community you know and
26:58 - so that was really
27:00 - why i got interested in it and then
27:02 - ended up um
27:03 - really wanting to dive in
27:05 - yeah to me like so like right now i
27:07 - think if you're not if you're young and
27:09 - a programmer
27:11 - even if you're not young if you're a
27:12 - programmer yeah you want to build
27:14 - something on the internet i don't know
27:15 - why you wouldn't be working in web 3.
27:17 - let's so let's okay let's bring it down
27:19 - a level to like make it really layman
27:22 - terms so for example you know if i don't
27:24 - really know too much about it i listen
27:25 - to you and i just hear it like fancy
27:27 - words let's just say like decentralized
27:29 - right but i'm like but spotify works
27:31 - just fine and spotify is growing so like
27:33 - why do we need audience the only things
27:36 - i heard there was decentralize on
27:37 - blockchain but i don't really understand
27:39 - how that's so much different than
27:40 - spotify you know or how brain trust is
27:43 - so much different than let's say upwork
27:46 - um yeah so yeah like so here i'll
27:48 - explain it in the sense of bringing the
27:50 - example brain trust right sure because i
27:51 - asked the same question for the longest
27:52 - time like upwork works fine right yeah
27:54 - yeah yeah exactly
27:56 - there's a website i'm like search for
27:57 - like designer
27:59 - look at them to email them through this
28:01 - thing and then like i booked with them
28:02 - right yeah and my friends adam and gabe
28:05 - who who created the braintrust project
28:07 - were like they were web 2.0 guys before
28:10 - right they had created like adam and
28:12 - created a ton of marketplaces and adam
28:13 - was like look these marketplaces are
28:16 - extractive right there and by extractive
28:18 - it means like they are exploit they've
28:20 - become exploitative to
28:23 - the internet right
28:24 - and so what happens is like like twitch
28:26 - is the same way actually like all these
28:28 - things like kickstarter twitch patron
28:30 - patreon you know amazon ebay like every
28:34 - marketplace right uber airbnb
28:36 - like br and and upwork yeah all these
28:39 - companies and like everything is a
28:40 - marketplace and you know most a lot of
28:42 - these web web 2 companies or
28:43 - marketplaces yeah the way they work is
28:45 - they come in and they spend a lot of
28:47 - marketing to get users on both sides
28:49 - both the like supply side so in the case
28:51 - of brain trust it's like people who are
28:53 - um providing it's for brainchild it's
28:56 - like people are like freelancers right
28:57 - like so designers engineers stuff like
28:59 - that and then the buyers like the buy
29:02 - side that's the people who are buying
29:03 - things like the in this case in the case
29:05 - of brain trust it's like you know people
29:07 - i want to hire programmers so like big
29:08 - companies and stuff like that yeah and
29:11 - what they do is they're like they market
29:12 - to these people so they make the market
29:14 - marketplace and then they can charge
29:16 - them like whatever they want right once
29:18 - all the work is on brain trust or sorry
29:20 - on upwork once the work is on upwork
29:21 - then if you're a freelancer you kind of
29:22 - have to go to upwork right yeah once all
29:24 - the apartments are in airbnb if you're
29:26 - traveling it's not like you can just
29:28 - book directly right to save yourself
29:29 - money you can you basically have to go
29:31 - to airbnb and then you have to pay 20 or
29:33 - sometimes more right to all of the
29:35 - different to the middlemen right so true
29:38 - 20 for operating this website is that
29:40 - fair i don't know but it could be lower
29:42 - right yeah if you think about the 20
29:44 - it's 20 that's coming out of the mouth
29:45 - of that freelancer right got it and so
29:48 - yeah i remember like i
29:49 - um sorry to cut you off but like just to
29:52 - relate with what you're saying i was i
29:54 - in 2015 2016 i used to teach i used to
29:58 - tutor people in chess and coding on this
30:00 - website called yzant and it was a
30:01 - marketplace for students and teachers
30:04 - and i was making majority of my income
30:06 - from there like a lot of my income from
30:08 - there and like uh close i was making
30:10 - close to six figures from there and for
30:12 - me at that time it was huge because i
30:13 - was going to college uh you know near
30:15 - that time and i remember one time they
30:18 - just decided to ban my account and like
30:20 - literally i got no customer support they
30:22 - would also take 40 of my income and then
30:25 - at some point just banned my account i
30:26 - had no customer support no way to ever
30:28 - get it back and like overnight i lost
30:30 - all my income and i'm like [ __ ] this i'm
30:32 - like i'm just gonna build my own uh
30:34 - platform and a channel and provide value
30:36 - to people that way um now i'm dependent
30:38 - on youtube but like yeah that's why i
30:41 - cut them off but i'm i was just trying
30:42 - to relate with what you were saying but
30:43 - i apologize exactly that's that's an
30:45 - exactly perfect example because i mean
30:48 - in your case you're a very competent
30:50 - motivated person so you were able to
30:51 - like say okay i'm going to take that and
30:53 - i'm going to move forward and move on
30:54 - with like something new right yes like
30:56 - you said you're still dependent on
30:57 - youtube but like yeah you build rebuild
30:59 - back better right but like not everyone
31:01 - can do that right not everyone's going
31:02 - to do that and it's like if you think
31:04 - about your relationship with wise and
31:05 - it's incredibly extractive they're
31:07 - taking 40 of your income yeah and
31:09 - they're there for and then they can shut
31:11 - you off at any moment which they did
31:13 - right yeah so
31:14 - the point about making why should upwork
31:16 - become a decentralized protocol like
31:18 - brain trust right well yeah number one
31:20 - the fees on brain trust go down to like
31:22 - zero percent right so they they
31:23 - basically take no fee so it's like it's
31:25 - just an open protocol anyone can put
31:27 - labor on it anyone can
31:29 - book and the fee is zero and then so
31:31 - that's like much better for you right
31:33 - the community who are people are making
31:35 - it and then the second thing is like
31:37 - they can't kick you off right like it's
31:38 - an open protocol and so you are it's
31:41 - much better for you to participate in so
31:43 - brain trust so brain trusts like company
31:47 - can't deactivate there's no company it's
31:49 - like a protocol like it's just like it's
31:51 - a protocol that they made to like uh
31:53 - manage work and then that's it like so
31:56 - there's no like customer service person
31:58 - from there that can just come and
31:59 - deactivate my account if i'm on brain
32:01 - trust that's right so wow so that is
32:03 - powerful and and then the last thing is
32:05 - like you own tokens right for
32:07 - participating in this for bringing your
32:10 - labor like you're saying you're making
32:11 - you're part of the market you're making
32:13 - that market so you get a reward of in
32:16 - terms of like the governance of this
32:18 - variance you get government you get
32:19 - tokens that represent like some portion
32:21 - of like how much you're voting if this
32:23 - what what happens with the braintrust
32:24 - protocol
32:25 - that makes sense it's not like the
32:27 - founders control it they can say i don't
32:29 - you know like cassie i'm gonna like kick
32:31 - him off you know yeah like yeah but
32:33 - here's my here's one of the questions i
32:35 - had let's say that you made twitch today
32:36 - but on the blockchain or somebody made
32:38 - youtube today on the blockchain if it's
32:40 - truly decentralized and you can't
32:42 - control anything well there's certain
32:43 - things i do want controlled like i don't
32:45 - want uh you know i don't want to go on
32:48 - the youtube page and see like extreme
32:50 - amount of violence or
32:52 - somebody posting some random video right
32:54 - um so like what about those types of
32:57 - things because there are there's a
32:58 - certain level where i'm happy that
33:00 - youtube is censoring and those videos
33:02 - aren't coming to my page right like you
33:04 - don't want to see like uh you know isis
33:06 - kidnapping and getting or somebody yeah
33:08 - beheading exactly i don't want to see
33:10 - that right so i'm happy that twitch
33:11 - doesn't show me that you know and
33:13 - youtube doesn't show me that so so you
33:16 - know the way that these com protocols
33:17 - are addressing that today is uh they are
33:19 - doing some sort of moderation where like
33:21 - there is like community voting there's
33:22 - like some subsection of the community is
33:25 - basically voting and moderating
33:27 - and then are rewarded for that and so
33:29 - you know there are ways to like
33:30 - basically have reintroduce control that
33:32 - but that instead of it being like a
33:33 - centralized company it's done by like a
33:35 - community of people understood got it
33:37 - okay so so i mean i guess it depends on
33:39 - like do you think censorship from your
33:41 - peers i mean it's the same idea as
33:43 - america right which is like if you're
33:45 - gonna put on trial you get a trial of
33:47 - like the jury the jury decides right
33:49 - yeah we're saying like that is better
33:51 - obviously we don't want to live in a
33:52 - world where people can't commit any or
33:53 - can commit any crime so we're going to
33:55 - like have to try people but instead of
33:56 - it being like the king is like okay
33:59 - off with his head it's going to be a
34:00 - jury of your peers right then that's
34:02 - maybe more in line with how web 3 is
34:04 - work is shaping up to work and i would
34:06 - say it's still really early so we're
34:07 - figuring it out what's the incentive for
34:09 - the brain trust people that made it so
34:11 - the incentive is like the everybody
34:13 - who's participating in the creation of
34:15 - this is rewarded in some tokens so the
34:17 - founders of brain trust all the people
34:18 - contribute to brain trust all the
34:20 - freelancers who are bringing in both
34:22 - other talents and then also um
34:25 - you know clients like everybody gets
34:26 - rewarded tokens and then these tokens
34:28 - are used as the governance you know to
34:30 - govern brain trust got it okay
34:32 - understood and then i'm at some point
34:34 - they'd be able to like so say i was i
34:36 - created braintrust or i'm a developer
34:38 - that tomorrow starts uh app like
34:40 - braintrust i get a bunch of my own
34:42 - tokens in the start which have literally
34:44 - zero value but i bring all these people
34:46 - into the community and then as more and
34:48 - more people started using this the value
34:50 - starts going higher and higher higher
34:52 - and then like let's just say i initially
34:54 - had 100 tokens or a thousand tokens if
34:56 - the value becomes ten dollars or a
34:58 - hundred dollars now all of a sudden i
34:59 - have a hundred thousand dollars yeah
35:00 - exactly it's it's kind of like people
35:02 - are buying or earning these tokens and
35:04 - then if the project does well you know
35:06 - hopefully they share in the success of
35:07 - the project got it that is really cool i
35:09 - think the economy part you were hitting
35:11 - on that was super interesting to me
35:13 - because twitch essentially created a a
35:15 - new economy right for example uh my
35:18 - friend eric rosen who's a chess player
35:21 - he's super popular now on youtube we
35:23 - went to high school together played
35:24 - chess and now he has now he's making an
35:27 - income from twitch and a bunch of
35:29 - creators i know yeah right it's so cool
35:31 - uh hikaru nakamura who i used to i loved
35:34 - watching him uh play but i would get i
35:37 - would so rarely get to see his games
35:39 - before but now because he makes a living
35:41 - from twitch he's just like streaming all
35:43 - the time so i can just watch his stuff
35:45 - anytime that i want and like this is
35:46 - exciting so like twitch truly created an
35:49 - economy uh for people i feel like with
35:52 - web 3 you can you can even take that one
35:54 - step further like you know i think you
35:57 - play league of legends right or do you
35:58 - or
35:59 - i have i i've played before but i'm not
36:02 - i wouldn't consider myself a league of
36:03 - legends player so let's say some
36:05 - starcraft 2 was my my game that i liked
36:08 - okay so say starcraft 2 or league of
36:10 - legends or whatever but i feel like
36:11 - people who start getting good at these
36:13 - games now will be able to actually make
36:15 - living off of them because they'll have
36:17 - their own economies like axe infinity is
36:20 - a very basic version of this being
36:22 - implemented and already kind of working
36:24 - and i feel like new games that are
36:26 - coming out because i when i was young
36:27 - and i was playing borderlands and i
36:29 - would just grind away for 15 to 20 hours
36:31 - a day that would have been so cool if i
36:32 - was able to make an income off of that
36:34 - too because i would literally just be
36:35 - gaming like all the time you know i
36:38 - would never do anything else do you feel
36:39 - like that's kind of true or like what do
36:42 - you feel about that well i think people
36:43 - are experimenting with different types
36:45 - of economies and different types of
36:46 - games so i think there are games where
36:48 - they're like okay we want people to be
36:49 - able to you know make money primarily as
36:52 - like a you know make a living i guess by
36:54 - by playing this game and uh you know
36:56 - that requires an inflow of people who
36:58 - are like they're saying okay i want to
36:59 - buy the stuff that this guy's earning
37:01 - like if you know person a is like
37:02 - earning a bunch of stuff by grinding
37:04 - this game or playing the game then
37:06 - person b has to come and say like i want
37:07 - to get some of that stuff and i'm
37:08 - willing to just pay money yes right
37:10 - which is kind of like the dynamic that
37:11 - exists today in some games
37:13 - where people are just willing to pay for
37:15 - like cosmetics or like you know to
37:17 - advance or whatever yeah um so you know
37:19 - it could be that could work like i could
37:21 - see that happening other other games i
37:23 - think are more like you know the stuff
37:24 - that i would say there's a lot of games
37:26 - that want to be like have you know you
37:28 - own this thing you can trade it but
37:29 - maybe the primary purpose of you playing
37:31 - this game is not economic you know i
37:33 - think in order for games to be fun like
37:35 - you have to have a really high ratio of
37:37 - like players who are not just playing it
37:38 - for economics yeah that's true and i
37:41 - yeah so i think and i think most game
37:43 - companies will come around to being like
37:45 - oh the most important thing is like that
37:46 - this game is fun right that's yeah
37:48 - that's playing that's 100 true and you
37:51 - personally are you um trying to create a
37:54 - gaming company because you're focused on
37:56 - the gaming side or are you creating are
37:58 - you currently working on creating like a
38:00 - marketplace a gaming marketplace i guess
38:02 - i want to know what fractal is yeah
38:04 - fractal's a marketplace and it helps
38:06 - people basically we help launch game
38:08 - companies who are building these games
38:10 - in um you know like web 3 games so
38:12 - they're building a blockchain game and
38:13 - there's some sort of you know open
38:15 - economy or open economic portion of it
38:17 - so that looks like you know oftentimes
38:19 - these games have nfts that they're
38:20 - selling to their audience and the nfts
38:23 - are you know skins in the game their
38:24 - characters their items you know whatever
38:27 - it is yeah and um so you could think of
38:29 - like the existing free-to-play model
38:30 - where you know there's a game like
38:32 - league of legends you have to like buy
38:33 - characters or or you like you know or i
38:36 - guess they're heroes right you buy
38:37 - heroes or like you you can get like um
38:39 - and like you can there's stuff you could
38:41 - buy in the game but in in the case of a
38:42 - blockchain game it's like this stuff is
38:45 - yours right like you can resell it to
38:46 - someone else you can send it to a
38:48 - different wallet like the company
38:50 - doesn't control what you do with it
38:52 - after you buy it got it and so i think
38:53 - it's just a natural evolution of free to
38:55 - play and and that's what where our games
38:57 - are headed yeah yeah that makes sense
38:59 - and then for you like um you know why i
39:01 - think you guys chose solana right for
39:03 - yes or this why solana right because
39:05 - everybody chooses ethereum or whatever
39:08 - so solana you know what what we want to
39:10 - do is be where the games are and so we
39:11 - went and talked when we started off we
39:13 - went and talked to a bunch of games and
39:15 - i think a lot of games were choosing
39:16 - ethereum and then a lot of games were
39:17 - choosing solana and solana was the
39:20 - platform where it's like if i was a
39:22 - developer and i was building i would
39:24 - probably pick solana myself you know
39:26 - because i mean i am a developer actually
39:28 - so like it was kind of like the choice
39:30 - that i would have wanted to make
39:30 - technically yeah you know for this yeah
39:33 - because it's like a fashion you have the
39:34 - experience being a developer like yeah
39:36 - yeah i was a programmer that's how i'm
39:38 - how i became a tech entrepreneur right
39:40 - huge that's [ __ ] respect that's sick
39:42 - yeah i was a programmer and we built our
39:44 - first apps myself i built the original
39:46 - justin tv api which you know like became
39:49 - the twitch parts of twitch anyways so
39:51 - like ham okay um
39:53 - yeah so i you know i i wouldn't say i
39:55 - was the best developer but i definitely
39:57 - you know was a programmer so yeah for me
40:00 - we kind of made that choice but we want
40:01 - to be everywhere games are you know so
40:03 - like ultimately i don't know if you know
40:05 - if that's solana if that's other places
40:06 - you know we want to be um can we want to
40:08 - be everywhere the games get the games go
40:11 - and so uh yeah yeah that's that's kind
40:14 - of how we think about it got it um go
40:16 - ahead yeah the last thing i'll say is
40:17 - like you know we are hiring because i
40:18 - mean this uh this is a channel full of
40:20 - developers we're hiring people to come
40:22 - work on fractal it's growing really
40:23 - quickly i mean yeah we're selling tons
40:25 - of
40:26 - uh nfts and primary mints that's like
40:28 - where we help the um
40:31 - the developers drop their assets to
40:32 - their audience so we help them sell
40:34 - their assets to the audience and uh you
40:36 - know we've been live for just a couple
40:37 - weeks and i've already done like
40:38 - millions and millions of dollars of
40:39 - sales so uh
40:41 - it's working pretty good um and we're
40:43 - looking for people who want to join the
40:44 - team like talented engineers
40:46 - uh solana you know also ethereum and
40:49 - also you don't have to know anything
40:50 - about crypto if you just like want to be
40:52 - a you know you want to learn like we're
40:54 - uh yeah we're excited but if you're a
40:56 - web 2 developer and you are just jumping
40:59 - into crypto and maybe you have like two
41:01 - weeks or one month of experience because
41:03 - i know a lot of people don't have any
41:04 - because solana is on rust most people
41:06 - don't have any rust related experience
41:07 - so what if it's somebody who has maybe a
41:10 - bunch of experience as a developer but
41:12 - just jumped into crypto like a month ago
41:15 - or like two weeks ago yes i mean that's
41:17 - perfect i want to hire people who like
41:18 - they don't need to have a crypto
41:20 - experience there's like so many rules
41:21 - like there's
41:22 - you know front end rolls back and rolls
41:25 - you know that are
41:26 - non non-rust or or um a solidity you
41:29 - know but obviously if you have solidity
41:31 - or rust experience that's great too so
41:33 - amazing
41:34 - yeah okay awesome so guys
41:36 - we'll uh have the link in the
41:37 - description for a form and you and i can
41:40 - talk about the form if you want
41:41 - additional questions or anything in it
41:43 - just fill that out guys yeah um okay
41:46 - amazing yeah so i think that's super
41:48 - freaking cool um you know i think as the
41:50 - last couple of questions do you have a
41:52 - couple more minutes yeah yeah okay
41:54 - okay awesome you're good cool so i think
41:57 - like a lot of people want to get into
41:59 - this web through space a lot of
42:00 - developers want to get into it like
42:02 - what's the opportunity for a developer
42:04 - to get into this space you know is it
42:06 - going away sometime soon is it kind of a
42:09 - risky thing to jump into because that's
42:11 - why i think a lot of developers are not
42:13 - like they're they're scared and they're
42:14 - holding on and they're like web 2. so
42:16 - you know why why should a developer
42:19 - jump into this space right now yeah so
42:22 - you know i would i would say that this
42:24 - is where i think most innovation is
42:26 - going to happen and i think the most
42:27 - interesting innovation is happening
42:29 - already on the internet um i think the
42:32 - idea like when i was starting off in web
42:34 - 2 it felt like we were discovering how
42:35 - people were going to talk to each other
42:37 - on the internet communicate on the
42:38 - internet and like you know so that was
42:40 - instagram that was twitch that was
42:41 - facebook that is a [ __ ] cool way to
42:43 - think about it that is really cool yeah
42:45 - yeah that is and then but now it feels
42:47 - like we're discovering how people are
42:49 - going to value things on the internet
42:50 - right so like now it's like nfts are
42:53 - like they're they're people regarding
42:55 - it's like how people regard value like
42:57 - in art but also like people are selling
42:59 - nft access passes and people are selling
43:01 - like parts of you know access to
43:02 - communities and
43:03 - there's all these different things that
43:04 - people are like valuing there's like
43:06 - digital value now in in kind of digital
43:08 - goods and assets and that to me is
43:10 - really interesting um and so it just
43:12 - there's a lot being invented it moves
43:14 - really quickly um and i'd encourage you
43:16 - to just dive in now that being said i
43:19 - think there's gonna be a crypto bear
43:20 - market and there's gonna be a bear
43:22 - market in all like speculative assets i
43:24 - think uh it's already happening right so
43:26 - the late stage tech
43:28 - like and then all the way down like
43:29 - crypto and pokemon cards and like
43:32 - everything else that people are just
43:33 - yellowing into right coins and wall
43:35 - street bets stocks and all you know
43:37 - everything so yeah you know if you're
43:40 - looking for like uh what's the
43:41 - short-term play like you know i don't
43:43 - know you should figure that out yourself
43:44 - i don't know but i think long-term
43:47 - crypto is going to be there's gonna be a
43:49 - lot of amazing stuff invented here and i
43:51 - think it's a it's a good long-term
43:52 - career move for sure absolutely uh yeah
43:55 - i think crypto that that makes sense to
43:57 - me why crypto is a good move uh long
44:00 - term for people you know um i think a
44:02 - lot of developers have trouble
44:04 - understanding this but i think there's a
44:06 - lot of you know even if you're watching
44:08 - this right now and you get even slightly
44:10 - curious i would just do some learning
44:12 - around it you know that's
44:14 - that's personally what i did justin like
44:16 - i was curious and skeptical and then i
44:18 - just started learning stuff and then i
44:19 - just discovered this whole new world and
44:21 - i was like holy crap this is amazing and
44:24 - i'm i'm not gonna say i get it
44:26 - completely there's a lot that i don't
44:27 - get yet and i'm in the process of
44:29 - learning but it's i feel like it's worth
44:32 - learning the space and a lot of solid
44:35 - amazing web 2 developers that i know
44:37 - from big fan companies or all of them i
44:39 - see them switching over to web 3 and
44:40 - they're getting web 3 jobs
44:43 - you know um when it comes to starting a
44:45 - company like fractal what's your process
44:47 - right now like you know for a normal
44:49 - person they spend a lot of time building
44:51 - traction blah blah when i think about
44:53 - from your perspective and this is just
44:55 - this is from my layman understanding and
44:57 - i would love to know you think about i
44:58 - want to start this company and then do
45:00 - you go uh this is a good idea i'm going
45:02 - to talk with some people it makes sense
45:04 - all right now i'm going to get funding
45:05 - for this and then let's build a
45:07 - marketplace or i what's your what's your
45:11 - um i guess in a simplified way because i
45:14 - know we don't have so much time to get
45:15 - into it it would be a whole other
45:16 - podcast but how did you go about
45:18 - building and launching this freaking you
45:20 - know new company yeah so it's all about
45:22 - for me when i start a company it's all
45:24 - about who yeah you know i have lots of
45:25 - ideas i always have ideas but it's all
45:27 - about who am i going to work with on it
45:29 - and so in this case i had a friend uh
45:31 - dave wurtz who's at google at the time
45:33 - yeah and uh he and i had been
45:35 - brainstorming about like something
45:37 - things in crypto we'd known each other
45:38 - for you know 15 years i'd always wanted
45:40 - to work with him he's like a super smart
45:42 - guy and so yeah we brainstorming stuff
45:44 - and then he was like we came with this
45:45 - idea for fractal you know because i was
45:47 - really into the gaming entities idea and
45:48 - then uh he we pulled in you know
45:51 - two other co-founders my business
45:52 - partner robin chan who's like uh he was
45:54 - a gaming guy as well he had stolen a
45:56 - gaming company to zynga and then mike
45:58 - angel who's a engineer and uh like an
46:01 - amazing engineer and basically just said
46:04 - hey let's build it mike built the whole
46:05 - thing in a month and then we launched it
46:08 - you know like in january and they're
46:09 - like end of december and so you know
46:11 - move really quickly yeah from idea to
46:13 - like first launch was probably five
46:14 - weeks yeah uh moved incredibly quickly
46:17 - and then the goal was just like how'd
46:19 - you get so many people on it though like
46:20 - how did you get so many people on i know
46:22 - we just i did a bunch of i did a bunch
46:24 - of press about like hey we're launching
46:25 - you know twitch co-founders launching
46:26 - this new thing and you know that kind of
46:28 - like got our first seed and then we gave
46:30 - away an nft drop for for people um yeah
46:33 - and the ft drop has done like millions
46:35 - of dollars of secondary transactions
46:37 - since we launched it so like people are
46:38 - you know they're into it they're yeah
46:40 - yeah one last selfish question you are
46:44 - me or you're in this face uh you're
46:47 - you're in the position of clever
46:48 - programmer you are okay you're a
46:50 - business owner of a community and you
46:52 - have community of all these developers
46:54 - and now you're building this web 3. what
46:56 - is a good way forward to think if if i
46:59 - want to personally i want to build
47:00 - something amazing i'm not so much like
47:02 - it needs to be this massive thing i just
47:04 - want to build something amazing and look
47:06 - for
47:07 - big opportunities to chase so i'm in the
47:09 - process of me just learning um and i
47:11 - feel like there's a lot of knowledge
47:12 - that i'm missing so you know if you were
47:14 - in my position would you be thinking
47:16 - about launching something on the web 3
47:19 - space um or i'm not sure but like how
47:22 - would you make a decision on what to do
47:24 - next or how to grow a big company from
47:25 - here yeah i mean i'd be thinking about
47:27 - the web3 space for sure because i think
47:28 - that's where most innovation is and then
47:30 - i'd be like okay what assets do i have
47:32 - and like where can i find like how can i
47:35 - invest those assets in something that's
47:36 - really high value right yeah and so that
47:39 - could look like you have your community
47:41 - right you have a community of
47:42 - programmers right presumably some of
47:43 - these programs are really good right
47:45 - that's that's like a scarce asset so
47:47 - then how can you and you have a channel
47:49 - like to market something so you know
47:51 - maybe i would be thinking about like
47:53 - there's probably a bunch of different
47:54 - ways you could do it like one is like
47:56 - create some sort of community down
47:58 - like where your community is
47:59 - participating in
48:01 - in like investing in projects and things
48:03 - like that um yeah another thing would be
48:05 - like you could figure out how to use
48:07 - your community to like help build help
48:09 - you build a pro product write a project
48:11 - um and if you don't have any ideas for
48:13 - projects i wonder if you could like you
48:14 - know there's all these projects they're
48:15 - giving out like token grants for you
48:18 - know work like and so maybe you could
48:20 - like find the projects that you really
48:21 - are into that you think are going to be
48:23 - successful and then you could just like
48:24 - become part of those projects you know
48:26 - by providing developer resources to
48:28 - build stuff god knows just like my
48:29 - 30-second response off the top of my
48:31 - head i love it this is great um justin
48:34 - this has been awesome thank you so much
48:36 - i know that we had the time slot until
48:38 - uh this time so i want to respect your
48:40 - time any last words or anything you want
48:43 - to uh share yeah like there's probably a
48:45 - lot of people out there who are
48:47 - skeptical of web3 right that's that's a
48:48 - very common thing on the internet you
48:50 - know i i would say like don't let
48:52 - skepticism close your mind off right
48:54 - like it's better like it doesn't cost it
48:56 - doesn't hurt you to learn right like
48:58 - kazi said like just get out there and
48:59 - start learning something and then make
49:00 - your own opinion right but like if
49:02 - you're just you know there's a lot of
49:02 - people in the gaming ecosystem it's like
49:04 - always like oh nfts are bad for the
49:06 - environment or they're like toxic or
49:08 - they're scams or whatever it's like well
49:09 - you know that's like an opinion that's
49:10 - like a meme opinion that's not like an
49:12 - opinion that's
49:14 - informed by like you learning anything
49:16 - yeah so um it never hurts to learn and i
49:18 - think coming from a place of like
49:20 - curiosity is always better for you so i
49:22 - guess that's my psa one and number two
49:24 - is like obviously you should come work
49:25 - at fractal and uh hopefully i'll see you
49:27 - guys soon

50:10 - pretty fun for powering how you know
50:12 - web3 gaming will work yeah um so i think
50:15 - there's a lot of api engineering and sdk
50:18 - you know kind of it's more of an sdk in
