00:36 - got the stories component at the top as
00:38 - you guys can see and there will be ton
00:40 - of components that you guys are going to
00:41 - be building right so first of all you're

00:47 - login screen to sign up and all of that
00:49 - and then there's tons and tons of
00:50 - components we're gonna be building like

04:26 - and i know a lot of you struggle with
04:28 - the javascript parts i know a lot of you
04:30 - guys while you're building these clones
04:31 - and following along a lot of you are new
04:34 - to coding right a lot of you that join
04:36 - our coding bootcamp or just i get to
04:38 - talk to you're a lot of you're new so if

04:55 - will be going during this live with that
04:56 - said guys that's it uh we're gonna get
05:00 - wrap wrap this up and get into the build
05:02 - at this point okay so if you're
05:03 - interested check out that javascript uh
05:05 - course link is in the description it's
05:07 - freaking awesome
05:09 - cool
05:10 - so let's go ahead and
05:12 - get it rocking and rolling at this point
05:15 - so few things we're going to do okay so
05:17 - first of all we're going to start a
05:18 - brand new project
05:20 - all right we're going to start
05:21 - completely brand new project i'll have
05:24 - some music playing here if it bothers
05:26 - you guys just let me know not a problem
05:30 - cool
05:31 - just have it like lightly playing in the
05:32 - background
05:34 - alright so here we go
05:36 - open up your terminal
05:38 - all right and even if you're a complete
05:40 - beginner trust me you can follow along
05:42 - and you can build it with me all right i
05:45 - know it's gonna look complex in the
05:46 - start but if you build it with me i
05:48 - promise a lot of things are gonna unlock
05:50 - you're gonna be able to understand a lot
05:52 - of what's going on
05:54 - all right so let's go
05:56 - people are saying we accept your new
05:57 - challenge that's awesome
06:00 - cool so here we go i'm going to go into
06:03 - my github folder and then i'm just going
06:05 - to create a folder
06:09 - let's actually now i'm just going to do
06:11 - npx
06:12 - create react native app just like this
06:15 - this allows you to start a brand new app
06:18 - and i'm gonna just call it ig clone
06:23 - youtube live okay you can call it ig
06:25 - clone that's fine this is just so
06:28 - it's easy for me to look at okay
06:30 - just click template from expo examples
06:32 - and just pick the blank one
06:35 - so this way we'll be building a expo
06:38 - react native app all right because expo
06:41 - makes it super easy to install and get
06:43 - started with everything if you don't
06:44 - have react native installed
06:46 - then um
06:48 - then basically what you can do is just
06:51 - go online look up how to install react
06:53 - native and that'll give you the
06:55 - instructions you need okay you're
06:56 - probably gonna need node installed and
06:58 - things like that
07:00 - let's see so this app is going to take a
07:02 - while we have some people asking how
07:04 - long does it take to build this app this
07:06 - app is going to take a while guys this
07:07 - is going to be a long build but we're
07:10 - going to try to go through it fast
07:11 - because it has a ton of functionality
07:13 - okay so i'm gonna try to make sure we
07:16 - don't go
07:17 - for ubereats we hit like six hours but
07:19 - we're gonna try to go much faster
07:21 - through this
07:23 - all right so let's go into ig clone
07:25 - youtube live and i'm gonna open up my
07:27 - code editor
07:29 - in this folder
07:31 - okay we'll close out of that
07:34 - and we'll keep this open
07:36 - boom
07:39 - all right and here we go appgs
07:43 - and i'm gonna do this
07:47 - move this over here so you guys can
07:49 - clearly see everything i'm gonna make
07:51 - this bigger
07:55 - all right
07:56 - so now let's go ahead and do this right
07:58 - i'm going to open it up and i'm going to
07:59 - just say yarn ios
08:02 - this is a you can just do yarn as well i
08:04 - do yarn ios because the shortcut way of
08:07 - opening up the iphone app as well
08:15 - the assets are going to be
08:17 - uh the assets are going to be available
08:19 - for you guys in the description as well
08:21 - um amanath or david if you guys can help
08:23 - with that
08:26 - hey angela's like bro you are insane yes
08:29 - sir
08:31 - cool here we go so let's see if this app
08:33 - is now working we'll refresh
08:35 - so now this will be a complete
08:38 - brand new project we're going to be
08:40 - starting this from scratch
08:43 - all right and i will try to explain it
08:45 - all step by step so you can follow along
08:49 - [Music]
08:52 - and the few shortcuts in here that could
08:55 - be useful for you is um
08:58 - hitting r
08:59 - inside of here that'll allow you to
09:01 - refresh
09:02 - okay
09:04 - all right so universal react app with
09:06 - expo so that basically means we're good
09:08 - to go and now we're going to work on our
09:11 - home screen with header so what what
09:13 - does that mean we're going to start off
09:15 - by building our home screen all right
09:17 - not the entire thing
09:19 - right because that's a lot we're going
09:21 - to start off with the first component of
09:23 - the home screen which you see at the top
09:24 - right so if you look at the top you see
09:26 - that header component
09:28 - that's the one that we're going to start
09:29 - off with this one okay so that's the
09:31 - first thing we're going to build and
09:33 - we're just going to start our home
09:35 - screen so we're gonna create that as
09:37 - well okay so just keep that in mind as
09:39 - we go through this so i'm gonna leave
09:40 - that leave this down here for you so you
09:43 - can know exactly what we're working on
09:45 - every step of the way
09:47 - uh and if this is helpful for you guys
09:50 - uh doing this let me know
09:52 - or if this doesn't matter at all let us
09:53 - know that too because
09:55 - save us some time next time
09:56 - cool so here we go
10:00 - let's get started with this
10:02 - all right so i'm going to create a um
10:05 - i'm going to create a new folder
10:08 - all right and i'm going to call it
10:09 - screens this will host all of my screens
10:13 - and inside of this i'm going to create
10:16 - home screen dot js
10:21 - okay
10:22 - and
10:23 - here's what we're gonna do i just like
10:24 - to do rnfe
10:26 - like this
10:27 - and let's just say home screen for now
10:33 - i'll go back to app and this app what i
10:37 - wanted to do is i just wanted to render
10:39 - my home screen
10:40 - so i'm just going to say this
10:45 - uh and notice that it auto completed
10:47 - this for me
10:49 - i'm also not going to need this for now
10:55 - right so take a look at that this home
10:57 - screen
10:59 - right there was auto completed
11:01 - okay or sorry
11:03 - added just by writing this and this
11:05 - import was auto imported cool so we got
11:09 - our home screen going but notice that
11:11 - it's in a place where we don't really
11:13 - want it to be
11:14 - right so how do we mitigate against that
11:17 - well i'll show you
11:19 - inside of home screen so i'm going to
11:21 - command click and go inside of home
11:22 - screen
11:24 - and we're going to wrap this component
11:26 - in a safe area
11:28 - view
11:30 - all right let's do safe area view
11:33 - and make sure to actually import safe
11:35 - area view as well so we'll do safe area
11:37 - view
11:38 - just like this
11:40 - now notice that
11:43 - it's now safe
11:45 - okay now it's actually showing up where
11:47 - it
11:47 - where we want it to show up essentially
11:50 - okay
11:51 - so that's exactly kind of
11:53 - what we want this is a good sign this is
11:55 - what i like to do whenever i'm starting
11:56 - a new component i just want to make sure
11:58 - hey can i read just basic text from
12:00 - there if i can then that's a really good
12:02 - sign
12:04 - oh by the way thank you
12:06 - so alex b
12:09 - really really appreciate you super chat
12:11 - and he goes let's go and he just dropped
12:13 - two pounds or is that two euro
12:16 - it's one of them but thank you i
12:18 - appreciate it
12:20 - not very good but yo there we go nice
12:23 - thank you manoff
12:25 - cool
12:25 - so i just turned off the music it was
12:27 - kind of distracting to me so hopefully
12:29 - if you guys want the music back let me
12:31 - know and we can have some vibes going
12:32 - but i kind of like this for now
12:34 - all right so
12:36 - let's go ahead and start now working on
12:38 - this home screen i'm going to put a
12:42 - header component here
12:44 - okay and now it's going to break so i'll
12:46 - just put that as a actual i'll just
12:47 - leave that as a comment right now
12:49 - because we're now going to make our
12:50 - component so let's go ahead make a new
12:53 - folder
12:54 - we're going to call it components
12:59 - inside of here i'm going to create
13:01 - another folder and it'll be called home
13:06 - all right
13:07 - so what this basically means is these
13:09 - will house all the components for our
13:13 - home screen
13:14 - and this component will be called
13:16 - header.js
13:18 - this is the component that you guys are
13:19 - seeing at the bottom left of the screen
13:25 - this is not pre-recorded arcade yes this
13:28 - is not pre-recorded indeed this is
13:30 - absolutely live
13:31 - yeah
13:35 - lander says shout out there we go lander
13:37 - here's your shout out
13:40 - so let's work on this component now okay
13:42 - so now let's go into header
13:44 - and header is going to have a lot of
13:46 - things okay but before we go and start
13:47 - working on header i want to do a couple
13:49 - of things to the home screen
13:51 - we want to make this dark as well all
13:53 - right so let's just come down here
13:56 - and i'm going to say i'm going to create
13:58 - a styles i will do stylesheet
14:01 - create
14:04 - okay
14:05 - and then inside of this i'm going to
14:06 - make a container and we're going to give
14:08 - it a
14:10 - background color
14:12 - of black
14:15 - and then what i want to do is i want to
14:16 - give it a flex one so this is a cool
14:18 - hack that you can do in react native
14:21 - all right
14:22 - let's import our style sheet as well
14:25 - from react native
14:27 - and then here i'm going to say style and
14:30 - we're going to say styles.container
14:33 - all right so now the whole screen just
14:35 - turned black that's exactly what we want
14:38 - here
14:41 - let's go down here we're going to go
14:43 - header
14:45 - all right this will be complaining for
14:47 - now that is absolutely okay
14:50 - so again the trick is r and f e inside
14:53 - of header and we will just say
14:56 - header like this let's go back to our
14:58 - home screen
15:00 - and i'm going to remove this r character
15:03 - i'm going to write it again
15:05 - go down here and hit enter and it will
15:07 - auto import this
15:09 - okay
15:12 - and i'm going to zoom in just a little
15:14 - bit so you guys can see this better
15:17 - oh wow
15:18 - that's ridiculous
15:20 - thank you so much
15:23 - this is wild wow fast chats
15:26 - gave ten dollar donation what the heck
15:30 - that is wild thank you so much oh now
15:33 - it's gone so that's so let's bring that
15:35 - back right there
15:36 - current full stack developer
15:38 - absolutely amazing really happy to hear
15:40 - that by the way where and where are you
15:42 - working that's dope
15:45 - okay
15:46 - so
15:48 - i got my header component okay
15:51 - now the header component is not really
15:53 - showing up so there are a few reasons
15:54 - number one is because the text color
15:57 - might be in black so let's go ahead and
15:59 - just do
16:00 - color
16:01 - white
16:02 - so now the header component is showing
16:04 - up so that's a really good sign header
16:06 - component is working
16:08 - uh basically how we want it to work okay
16:11 - that's really good
16:14 - and yes
16:15 - rnfe is the snippet extension okay
16:18 - that's what you need to uh you need to
16:20 - get that extension and that's where you
16:22 - can do the rnfe uh really easily as well
16:24 - okay so let's go
16:26 - react native snippets
16:30 - and it's probably going to be this
16:32 - number one
16:33 - this is the extension that you need to
16:35 - get okay this will allow you to get the
16:36 - all the snippets that you're looking for
16:44 - cool
16:47 - all right
16:48 - so
16:50 - here we go
16:54 - all right so we want to do a couple of
16:55 - things with this now so let's go inside
16:57 - of my header component and now we're
16:59 - going to get to work guys this is going
17:00 - to take it's going to take a second to
17:03 - make all of this stuff work okay so
17:05 - let's go ahead and
17:07 - let's create an image
17:11 - okay so i'll add an image
17:14 - i will do style styles.logo
17:21 - okay
17:25 - and the source will be kind of like that
17:29 - except we need the header logo
17:31 - all right so when i say this logo what i
17:33 - mean is it's the instagram logo that you
17:35 - see at the bottom left
17:37 - so i'll show you guys what that looks
17:38 - like it's gonna be this logo right here
17:40 - now if you have access to the assets
17:42 - file
17:43 - you're just gonna get it from there i
17:45 - have access to my assets file so i'm
17:47 - going to
17:50 - create a new folder
17:52 - and we'll create assets just like this
17:56 - and inside of my assets folder
17:58 - i will simply drop this asset like that
18:03 - all right
18:04 - and
18:05 - here i'm going to say header logo.png
18:10 - and now it's complaining hey i don't
18:12 - know what image is no worries we're just
18:14 - going to import that
18:17 - it also says hey i don't know what
18:19 - styles are so we're going to do
18:22 - style sheet
18:24 - okay and then we're just going to come
18:25 - down here i'm going to say con styles
18:29 - and i can just do style sheet dot create
18:34 - and we'll just leave a empty style sheet
18:36 - here for now
18:38 - all right now this logo is absolutely
18:41 - huge oh by the way we broke 500 likes so
18:43 - awesome thank you guys for smashing that
18:45 - like button appreciate it this video
18:47 - goes out and helps more people and that
18:48 - helps more people become developers so
18:50 - that's fantastic
18:52 - all right so now within this style sheet
18:54 - what we need to do is
18:57 - of course we want to give it some
18:58 - styling
18:59 - all right so let's go down here and
19:02 - we're going to say make the logo
19:05 - and i'm going to give it a width of a
19:06 - hundred
19:07 - height of 50 and then we're going to say
19:10 - resize mode and we'll just give it a
19:12 - contain
19:13 - there we go
19:14 - so now the logo is looking like how we
19:16 - want it to look like
19:18 - but we need to do a couple of things we
19:20 - need to put the whole thing in a
19:21 - container because when you guys see this
19:24 - over here right what i'm looking at what
19:26 - i see is
19:28 - i see one big container that contains
19:30 - everything and then inside of it i see
19:32 - two divs or two like separate containers
19:34 - one container or one div on the left
19:37 - hand side or let's do react native terms
19:39 - it's called views so i got a big view
19:42 - inside of it i got two baby views one on
19:44 - the left hand side that contains the
19:45 - logo one on the right hand side that
19:48 - contains all the icons
19:53 - all right
19:55 - so now let's go ahead and
19:59 - build uh that okay
20:01 - so this logo i'm gonna give it a
20:03 - touchable opacity as well because i do
20:05 - need it to be a
20:07 - touchable button
20:12 - all right
20:13 - it's going to complain it doesn't know
20:14 - what touchable opacity is but that's
20:16 - only because we haven't imported it yet
20:18 - so there we go now when i click it it
20:20 - detects it like a button click
20:22 - later we can make that a logout button
20:25 - but for now we're not going to add any
20:27 - additional functionality to it
20:30 - wow this is absolutely wild you guys
20:32 - prakash just gave you a five dollar
20:34 - donation he says love your channel bro
20:35 - i've started learning app development
20:37 - from it i messaged you and insta as well
20:38 - for it actually keep the amazing work
20:40 - absolutely prakash thank you so much for
20:42 - the five pound uh five euro donation
20:44 - really appreciate it this is crazy you
20:46 - guys this is awesome thank you so much
20:51 - thank you
20:52 - all right so
20:55 - let's put the whole thing
20:58 - right inside of a container so that's
21:00 - what we're going to do so this view i'm
21:02 - going to give it a container like
21:03 - styling and that will contain everything
21:06 - inside of it so let's go here and i'm
21:07 - going to go ahead and do container
21:12 - i'll put a comma here so it stops
21:13 - complaining at me
21:14 - and we're just going to go justify
21:16 - content
21:18 - and we'll go space between
21:22 - all right we'll go align items
21:25 - center
21:26 - flex direction
21:28 - i'll show you why you actually need to
21:30 - do row because it's interesting why you
21:32 - have to do that in react native actually
21:36 - we'll give it a 20 margin horizontal
21:38 - okay
21:41 - and now
21:43 - we'll call that here so we're gonna do
21:44 - style equals styles.container
21:48 - there we go
21:49 - so the styling just got applied now
21:51 - we're gonna need a bunch of more
21:53 - uh images
21:55 - okay
21:56 - so this part just requires us to put a
21:59 - bunch of more images okay so we got the
22:00 - header logo now we the next one
22:05 - so let's get outside of this touchable
22:07 - opacity here
22:08 - all right and we're also going to create
22:12 - a container for our icon so i'm going to
22:14 - create a view
22:16 - and this is going to have a style of
22:18 - styles
22:20 - dot icons container
22:23 - all right
22:24 - and this will contain all of our icons
22:26 - so i'll just put some dummy text here
22:28 - for now
22:32 - i'll give it a color of white just so
22:34 - you guys can see there we go and now
22:36 - it's showing up
22:40 - so the space between is what's allowing
22:43 - all of this to be like separated out
22:44 - right like if i actually
22:46 - remove this you guys see how it just all
22:48 - comes together like that so space
22:50 - between is making it really nice
22:52 - and now whatever i put in here
22:55 - right but this is why you'll notice that
22:57 - we actually need to give each of these
22:58 - containers a row because by default
23:02 - everything is column based
23:04 - okay so let's go down here
23:08 - and we're gonna go icons container
23:12 - and there's not much styling for the
23:13 - icons container honestly it's going to
23:15 - just simply be a flex direction of row
23:20 - and
23:20 - we don't really need to do much more
23:22 - than that so that should put it in a row
23:25 - oh my goodness this is crazy
23:27 - the donations are wild somebody just
23:29 - gave us 2 000
23:31 - of nigerian
23:34 - wow
23:35 - this is amazing thank you so much i
23:37 - really appreciated a lobby and we got a
23:41 - chandema and says thank you cp for
23:43 - making me so great after following most
23:44 - of the videos and clones finally i was
23:46 - hired as a full-time react developer
23:49 - yo
23:51 - that's crazy let's go
23:54 - that's awesome
23:56 - wow that's brilliant that makes me so
23:58 - happy to hear that
23:59 - thank you
24:01 - for sharing that
24:03 - all right so now we just need to put a
24:05 - couple of icons
24:07 - and uh we should be good okay and each
24:10 - of our icons is gonna have a certain
24:12 - style as well we're gonna add that
24:15 - oh my goodness
24:17 - [Laughter]
24:19 - this is crazy guys i am uh
24:22 - need to focus i need to focus i'll i'll
24:25 - i'll give a shout out to the super chats
24:26 - in just a second okay i need to focus a
24:28 - little bit i apologize
24:30 - so let's create a styling for icon as
24:33 - well because our icons will need some
24:35 - styling okay otherwise they're going to
24:36 - be huge actually you know what i'll put
24:39 - them without the styling just so you
24:40 - guys can see
24:41 - all right
24:43 - so i'll give you an icon right now
24:47 - so
24:48 - here i'm just going to put an icon
24:50 - alright
24:51 - this is the code snippet that i just
24:53 - pasted
24:55 - why did i paste this just because
24:57 - i don't want the stream to go on forever
25:00 - and this is very simple and already all
25:02 - of this i've pretty much explained okay
25:04 - i'll just explain some of the parts that
25:06 - are hard to understand here so
25:08 - first of all
25:09 - it's an image
25:11 - okay and it has a certain touchable
25:13 - opacity
25:15 - okay and that touchable opacity makes it
25:17 - clickable now why you're not seeing it
25:19 - is because it has the styles that icon
25:21 - and we don't have the icon styling yet
25:23 - so let's go ahead and do that we're
25:25 - going to create an icon styling like
25:28 - that
25:29 - and i'm going to go with 30
25:31 - height 30
25:35 - on this
25:38 - and we're gonna go
25:40 - and give it a margin
25:43 - margin left of 10
25:46 - and i'm gonna say resize mode will be
25:48 - contained just like this all right so
25:50 - now you guys see that plus sign over
25:52 - here
25:54 - boom it's it's showing up
25:57 - okay
25:57 - and again it's an image
25:59 - which takes in a source in source you
26:01 - pass in the link of the image so this is
26:04 - the link of the image
26:05 - all right use your own plus icon don't
26:08 - you don't need to copy mine
26:10 - uh but this is if you want to pause it
26:12 - and copy it you can alright so there we
26:14 - go we got that icon now we're just going
26:16 - to need a couple of more icons so all
26:19 - we're going to do is we're going to just
26:20 - take this
26:21 - okay and touchable opacity so when i
26:23 - click it it has that little effect
26:26 - and i'm simply going to paste once again
26:30 - and i'm going to go down and paste once
26:32 - again
26:33 - okay so i got three touchable opacities
26:36 - everything inside of the icons container
26:38 - the icons container is this invisible
26:40 - container right here
26:43 - uh and it's keeping all of these inside
26:45 - of it
26:46 - okay
26:48 - let's go to the icons container
26:50 - cool wow
26:55 - absolutely amazing guys this is so crazy
26:59 - coding with sneaky says you're so chill
27:00 - and actually very good just started
27:02 - learning react native this is very
27:03 - educational you got it brother thank you
27:05 - for being on here or sister
27:08 - don't know but thank you for being on
27:10 - here i appreciate you and i love your
27:11 - beautiful face for being on here
27:15 - okay so we got the three
27:17 - amazing looking icons
27:20 - we need to now just change their urls so
27:23 - they actually look like what we want it
27:25 - to look like okay
27:27 - so we're gonna just go ahead and do that
27:30 - okay so the first one is a plus sign so
27:33 - that will say plus two math that's
27:35 - completely all right
27:36 - the next one we're gonna need to change
27:38 - though
27:41 - there we go
27:43 - the next one is a like icon
27:46 - all right and i'm just using uh icons
27:48 - eight here
27:53 - uh you can also just go to icons eight
27:54 - website and be able to get the url just
27:57 - like how i am here
27:59 - all right there we go so now we have the
28:02 - three images showing up at the top our
28:04 - header component is looking pretty good
28:07 - let's just make sure there's not
28:09 - anything that we're really missing here
28:12 - so the the one more thing that we
28:14 - actually want to add in here
28:17 - is we want to be able to add a
28:20 - unread badge
28:22 - okay and so what does the unread badge
28:24 - look like well let me show you
28:26 - you guys see that red
28:29 - notifications thing the red bubble on
28:31 - top of the messenger icon that says 11
28:35 - that's the unread badge so we want to be
28:38 - able to create that badge now
28:40 - okay so let's go ahead and do that all
28:44 - right
28:45 - oh my goodness
28:47 - i'm sorry y'all you're gonna have to
28:49 - forgive me i don't care if you're

29:17 - so
29:19 - thank you for that eight dollar donation
29:20 - love your videos mate absolute legend
29:22 - got my love of coding from you please
29:24 - make a complete beginner's guide to
29:26 - coding and react i was actually thinking
29:28 - that and i will make it it will be very
29:30 - beginner friendly like this i understand
29:32 - this is not completely beginner friendly
29:34 - okay this is like this advanced stuff
29:36 - uh
29:37 - you'll understand it but like you won't
29:39 - be able to build it right completely
29:40 - yourself
29:41 - but the beginner series that's my goal
29:44 - just make it very very beginner friendly
29:45 - so thank you for the super chat
29:47 - appreciate it
29:48 - great so let's keep going we got the
29:50 - header component
29:52 - now we need to get the unread badge
29:55 - okay so let's think about how this
29:56 - unread badge is going to work and where
29:58 - is it going to be first of all where am
30:00 - i going to place it am i going to place
30:02 - it here
30:03 - or here or here
30:06 - right and where i actually want to place
30:09 - this unread badge is i actually want to
30:11 - place it preferably
30:14 - right here
30:16 - okay
30:17 - so let's go ahead
30:19 - and let's go inside of this facebook
30:21 - messenger i'm gonna go
30:23 - inside of this touchable opacity because
30:25 - i also want that to be a clickable thing
30:28 - all right and here's where we're gonna
30:31 - if you see these weird auto completions
30:32 - coming up that's github copilot which
30:36 - you should all have it's absolutely
30:37 - incredible
30:39 - all right so we're going to create a
30:41 - view here
30:45 - okay
30:46 - and this view will have a styling so i'm
30:49 - going to say style and we're going to do
30:50 - styles.unread badge and we'll create the
30:53 - styling for it in just a second
30:56 - all right and this will oh one note
30:59 - because it's already going to be an
31:01 - object we don't need to have two curly
31:03 - braces we can just have one curly brace
31:07 - all right and then we're gonna have text
31:11 - and we'll give it a style
31:14 - styles dot unread
31:16 - badge text you can see how
31:19 - amazing these github autopilot like
31:22 - suggestions are like it's so freaking
31:24 - smart it's ridiculous
31:25 - all right we'll go 11. okay now of
31:28 - course you're not going to be able to
31:29 - see it right now and that's because
31:31 - we're going to need to style it okay so
31:32 - it's going to need a bunch of styling so
31:34 - let's go ahead and do that now
31:36 - so i'll do unread badge
31:39 - okay and
31:41 - it's going to need a certain background
31:43 - color we need it to be slightly red so
31:45 - let's go ahead and give it a background
31:47 - color so now you can actually see it
31:49 - it's
31:50 - visible at least right it's not very
31:52 - pretty but it's visible
31:54 - the other thing that we actually need to
31:56 - do is we do need to give it a position
31:59 - absolute
32:00 - okay
32:03 - and the reason for this is because we
32:05 - want to be able to put it wherever we
32:07 - want
32:08 - all right
32:11 - and where should i put it well that's
32:14 - that's a good question so let's think
32:15 - about where we want to put this i'm
32:17 - going to do left of 20
32:19 - and we're going to do bottom of 18 like
32:22 - this
32:23 - so now we're moving it kind of to the
32:26 - right spot let's work with the width and
32:28 - the height because it's not looking like
32:29 - how we want it so i'm going to give it a
32:31 - width of 25 and we're going to give it a
32:33 - height of
32:34 - 18.
32:36 - okay now it's it's looking good
32:39 - now
32:40 - how do we get it to look circular well
32:43 - if you ever think anything circle what
32:45 - you're really thinking is border radius
32:47 - and look at my github co-pilot somehow
32:49 - magically it knows i want to give it a
32:51 - border radius
32:52 - weird
32:54 - okay so we're going to give it that
32:55 - border radius
32:57 - now any items that are inside of it i
32:59 - want them to be aligned centrally
33:02 - and notice that when i aligned items it
33:04 - didn't go vertically down it actually
33:06 - went horizontally centered it and that's
33:08 - because by default everything is column
33:10 - based in react native so everything you
33:12 - knew from regular web development
33:15 - um the flexbox stuff is just gonna be
33:18 - flipped and also in react native you
33:20 - don't actually ever have to do display
33:22 - flex so something for you to know
33:26 - all right
33:27 - and now we're going to justify the
33:28 - content to also be center this will
33:31 - actually vertically align it
33:33 - okay and we're going to give it a big z
33:35 - index just because i guaranteed want
33:38 - this to be at the top and above
33:39 - everything not behind anything so notice
33:42 - right right now that badge is actually
33:44 - behind the messenger icon as soon as i
33:47 - give it a z-index it's now in front
33:50 - and on top of that badge icon and that's
33:53 - exactly
33:54 - you know what we want now
33:56 - all we need to do is just give
33:58 - unread badge text styling
34:01 - let's go down here and i'm just going to
34:03 - color
34:04 - we're going to make it white cool
34:07 - and then we're going to make the font
34:09 - weight
34:10 - i'll make that 600
34:12 - all right and so now it looks a little
34:14 - bit bolder and it pops out so there you
34:16 - go guys there you have it i mean i don't
34:19 - know about you but to me it actually
34:21 - looks like
34:22 - we're quite done
34:24 - with our header component so if you
34:26 - enjoyed that
34:27 - give us some energy in the chat
34:29 - right and uh to show some love and we're
34:32 - gonna keep on going just for you
34:34 - beautiful let's keep on rocking and
34:36 - rolling
34:45 - nice
34:47 - hey jesse in the house let's go if you
34:49 - know react.js is super easy to learn
34:51 - react native yes absolutely that is
34:53 - completely correct
34:55 - oh my goodness
34:57 - uh we do have another super chat that
34:59 - happened i i can't even find it right
35:01 - now but
35:03 - thank you so much oh it's right there

35:08 - full stack mastery bootcamp april cohort
35:10 - best course for beginner
35:13 - joe amazing thank you for sharing that's
35:15 - unbelievable we do have a coding
35:17 - bootcamp
35:18 - we have now we're focused a lot on front

35:37 - that's the guarantee behind it we're
35:39 - fully behind it so if you're interested
35:41 - a link is in the description there's a

35:45 - and then if it's still good and it
35:46 - sounds good then you can book a call
35:47 - with us
35:48 - cool so let's keep rocking and rolling
35:50 - now the next component that we're going
35:52 - to build we're done with this component
35:54 - right so let me go back here
35:56 - and we're done with our header component
35:58 - so i'm going to remove that off of the
36:00 - screen the next component that we
36:02 - actually want to build is the stories
36:04 - component
36:06 - all right so this is going to be really
36:07 - nice and it's going to sit right
36:09 - underneath
36:10 - just like that oh that almost looks like
36:12 - it's real time that's cool
36:14 - so that's gonna sit right there so let's
36:16 - go ahead and i'm gonna just leave that
36:18 - down here
36:19 - so you can see what our target is and
36:21 - what we're trying to do here
36:24 - all right
36:26 - and um
36:28 - now let's start working on the stories
36:30 - component okay
36:36 - so when i think i'm gonna be working on
36:37 - a new component i like to think that i'm
36:40 - going to also be making a new file
36:42 - and since this file is inside of this is
36:45 - a
36:46 - this component is home screens component
36:48 - well guess where i'm going to put it
36:50 - inside of the home component folder
36:53 - cool we're going to call this stories.js
36:55 - just like this
36:58 - and uh
36:59 - just going to make sure everything is
37:01 - good
37:02 - i believe header is
37:04 - perfectly good we're good with that
37:07 - yes i believe we're good with this
37:08 - header stuff so let's move on to the
37:11 - stories now so in stories we're gonna
37:14 - need to do a couple of things oh let's
37:15 - put it in the right place guys so there
37:17 - we go stories is now
37:18 - actually inside of the homes folder
37:22 - simply going to do stories
37:23 - say stories
37:25 - write the text
37:27 - and
37:28 - i'm now just going to make sure that
37:30 - it's actually being rendered out onto
37:31 - the screen
37:33 - but first we're going to give it a text
37:35 - color of white because otherwise it
37:36 - won't show
37:38 - let's do that
37:39 - let's go inside of our
37:43 - home screen
37:45 - and here
37:47 - we're simply going to put stories like
37:49 - this
37:50 - auto complete that
37:53 - so auto import should be happening right
37:55 - there
37:56 - and there we go our stories is now
37:58 - showing up on the screen
38:00 - so
38:01 - it's being rendered and that's good and
38:03 - now we just need to go ahead and make
38:05 - more progress okay like add more things
38:07 - to it
38:09 - so that's it we don't need to touch this
38:11 - home screen file again we just now need
38:13 - to work on our stories component
38:16 - all right and in our stories component
38:18 - we're going to have a couple of things
38:19 - so again some things i'm going to paste
38:21 - just because they're very obvious and
38:23 - they just take a lot of time
38:25 - uh so we're going to be working with
38:27 - dummy data so i'm just going to paste
38:28 - this here
38:30 - okay so these are users
38:33 - all right
38:34 - and we just wanna be able to get access
38:36 - to these users okay so one another way
38:39 - we can do it
38:40 - i'm probably gonna run into some
38:42 - problems but that's okay we're just
38:43 - gonna create a new folder we're going to
38:45 - call it data
38:47 - all right and this data is really just
38:49 - going to be like our fake
38:51 - data
38:52 - where we're going to have
38:55 - like
38:56 - later on we're going to move this to an
38:58 - actual database but in the start we're
38:59 - just going to have this dummy database
39:00 - okay that's created by us
39:03 - so i'm going to cut this and take it out
39:04 - of this file we're going to go inside of
39:06 - data
39:07 - create a new file
39:09 - and this one will be called users.js
39:15 - all right new file
39:17 - users.js like this
39:20 - there we go
39:22 - all right
39:23 - let's go back to our stories component
39:26 - and our stories component will actually
39:28 - need access to those users
39:32 - all right so we'll be able to import
39:34 - that in just a second
39:36 - but now let's start working on our
39:37 - stories component so here's what we're
39:39 - going to do
39:42 - okay
39:44 - watch this auto uh
39:46 - import so i'm just going to actually
39:47 - make sure my auto import is happening so
39:50 - import users from
39:52 - backpack backpack data
39:54 - users all right i'm just going to delete
39:57 - this i know we're going to need access
39:58 - to users in just a second
40:01 - all right and
40:04 - let's go ahead and we're going to give
40:06 - it a
40:07 - certain margin bottom
40:11 - okay so that means that when we have
40:14 - another component
40:15 - it's gonna be like underneath this and
40:17 - give it some space
40:20 - okay stories is also a scrollable
40:24 - thing so we actually need to make it a
40:26 - scrollable component okay and how we're
40:28 - gonna do that
40:30 - is
40:32 - we're gonna give it a scroll
40:35 - view we're gonna say horizontal
40:38 - and we're going to make it
40:41 - alright let's actually import scroll
40:43 - view first scroll view
40:46 - now we're going to go horizontal
40:50 - and we'll go shows horizontal scroll
40:52 - indicator and we'll simply say false
41:01 - okay there we go we're gonna do equals
41:04 - just like that all right so now we got
41:07 - the scroll view now inside of the scroll
41:09 - view is where we actually want to add
41:11 - um everything that we're trying to add
41:25 - okay so i can have an image show up here
41:28 - right so let's actually just have one
41:29 - image show up first
41:31 - this let's import it from react native
41:35 - image so boom we got it imported right
41:37 - there
41:39 - and now this image we're going to give
41:40 - it a uri
41:43 - okay and let's actually write our map
41:45 - statement right here as well so we're
41:46 - going to do users.map
41:49 - and i'm going to say for each story and
41:51 - index
41:55 - i want to be able to do the following
41:58 - so
41:59 - here's what i'm going to do
42:01 - i'm going to take all this image stuff
42:02 - that i was writing i'm just going to
42:03 - move it into here
42:10 - all right there we go
42:14 - all right all this means is we're gonna
42:16 - have a loop
42:17 - and i'm just looping through my user's
42:20 - array because if i go to users right
42:22 - what is it so users
42:24 - are we got a user with their profile
42:26 - photo another user with their profile
42:28 - photo another user with their profile
42:30 - photo so on and so forth
42:34 - so we're just looping through them
42:36 - and as we're looping through them we're
42:37 - going to go image source
42:39 - and i'm simply going to do story dot
42:42 - image this will get me access to the
42:44 - image
42:46 - let's do uri here
42:48 - just like this
42:52 - okay now i need to also show this so
42:55 - we're gonna go style
42:57 - and we're going to do styles.story
43:03 - okay this is going to error out so what
43:05 - we need to do here just create a style
43:07 - sheet
43:09 - con styles
43:10 - style sheet dot create and i'm just
43:13 - gonna leave it blank for now
43:17 - and let's import our style sheet
43:22 - great
43:26 - okay
43:28 - so
43:29 - just a text stack just you guys know
43:31 - because i forgot to kind of talk about
43:32 - in the start but the text stack that you
43:34 - guys are actually going to be working
43:36 - with is going to be
43:38 - you know of course you're going to be
43:39 - doing react native
43:41 - you're going to be using firebase where
43:43 - everything is actually going to be
43:45 - stored and uploaded when you're going to
43:47 - be retrieving your data in real time so
43:49 - those posts you saw i forgot to mention
43:51 - but they're not dummy posts they're
43:52 - actually being directly pulled from
43:54 - firebase and they're being rendered out
43:57 - and when you
43:58 - like a post and you leave and you come
44:01 - back that like is actually there because
44:03 - all of that is actually being stored in
44:05 - a database
44:07 - right so all of these posts are
44:10 - live you guys all right so just want to
44:12 - let you know that also we're handling
44:14 - form validation when you're trying to
44:15 - log in so you can be putting in the
44:17 - wrong stuff to log in so we're using
44:18 - formic and yup for that so you'll also
44:20 - get to learn how formic and yep work so
44:23 - it was important i don't know i forgot
44:24 - to mention it but
44:26 - now is a good time as any to be able to
44:28 - just let you guys know that
44:31 - all right so we got the image we got the
44:35 - uh story
44:37 - now of course it's not going to be
44:38 - showing up because story does not have
44:41 - any size to it so we're just going to go
44:43 - to story
44:44 - and let's go like this and i'm just
44:46 - going to say width
44:47 - 80 and height 80 and let's just see if
44:50 - it shows us anything
44:52 - nice
44:53 - so now all of our story components are
44:55 - actually showing up
44:57 - they're not exactly showing up how we
44:59 - want them to
45:00 - so let's go ahead and give it a width of
45:03 - 70 and a height of 70 because i think
45:05 - they need to be a little bit smaller
45:08 - now i believe they actually need to also
45:10 - be a little bit circular
45:13 - so let's go ahead and make it circular
45:18 - dope so now they're actually starting to
45:20 - look better right this is uh this is a
45:22 - very good sign
45:24 - let's go down here
45:26 - and let's go and now we're gonna give it
45:28 - a margin left of six
45:30 - we're gonna give it a border width of
45:33 - three
45:43 - margin left is not a valid property
45:46 - oh because that's not margin i wrote it
45:49 - i spelled it wrong
45:52 - there we go
45:53 - so now
45:54 - you can start to see it's taking shape
45:57 - okay and we're gonna give a border color
46:02 - and let's give it a border color
46:04 - of
46:06 - this specific one
46:12 - make sure i'm using the right color here
46:18 - there we go
46:20 - so boom there you go now you can
46:22 - actually see
46:25 - all of the stories showing up
46:27 - but what's still different from the
46:29 - component that we're building if you
46:30 - notice
46:32 - what's different so far
46:34 - well the one thing that's different is
46:35 - we don't have the text or the names for
46:37 - each of those story components yet so
46:39 - let's go
46:40 - ahead and add the text for each of them
46:45 - right and we're going to do that right
46:47 - underneath this image but inside of the
46:49 - loop because we need to have this action
46:51 - repeat multiple times
46:54 - right so we're gonna go ahead and do
46:55 - that
46:59 - we
46:59 - what we also need to do
47:02 - is let's wrap this
47:08 - let's actually put the text first and
47:09 - let's just see what happens so we'll do
47:11 - text
47:12 - and i'll just say hello
47:18 - now this says you must have a parent
47:20 - component right so we'll make a view
47:24 - that'll be the parent component that
47:25 - they're inside of
47:26 - okay and now of course it's not showing
47:29 - up so we're going to make sure that we
47:31 - give it a style and we're going to say
47:32 - color white
47:34 - so now hello is showing up everywhere we
47:36 - want it to show up but we don't want
47:37 - hello to show up instead what we want to
47:40 - show up is
47:41 - story dot user
47:46 - not like that let's put it in just x
47:48 - curly braces
47:50 - there we go so now the names are showing
47:52 - up but notice that some of the names are
47:55 - too long like for example nas domonsky
47:57 - is a long freaking name right i don't
47:59 - know why that guy has that name his
48:01 - actual name is nazari domonsky so super
48:04 - freaking long so now how do we
48:08 - account for that and make it so there's
48:10 - like three dots showing up if the name
48:12 - is too big right so this is where we
48:14 - actually need to use a little of a
48:17 - little bit of
48:18 - javascript skills
48:20 - okay
48:23 - so let's go ahead and do that now for
48:25 - the text
48:29 - also just so we don't get any errors
48:31 - let's give this view a key and let's
48:33 - just give it the index that's going to
48:35 - make sure that each of the things that
48:36 - we're looping through is indeed it has
48:38 - its own key otherwise react freaks out
48:40 - okay and it actually improves your
48:43 - uh
48:43 - your reacts performance by a lot if you
48:46 - give it an index
48:48 - cool
48:49 - so now what i want to do is where i
48:52 - wrote story.user
48:54 - i'm going to now write some javascript
48:57 - right inside of here okay so just follow
48:59 - along with me because this part might
49:00 - freak you out but it's okay hopefully it
49:02 - won't do it too much
49:04 - so what we're going to do is we're going
49:05 - to do
49:06 - story.user.length and if
49:09 - it's greater than 11
49:11 - then what we're going to do is we're
49:13 - going to do
49:14 - story.user.slice and just give us the
49:16 - first like 10 characters
49:19 - make them lower case
49:23 - all right
49:25 - uh and give me like
49:27 - give me some night nice dot dot dots in
49:31 - front of it okay so like this
49:34 - so if the name is really long
49:37 - let's go 10 here
49:39 - oh 11 is fine that's fine so the name is
49:42 - longer than 11 characters
49:45 - give me the first 10
49:47 - plus so just basically max it out at 10
49:50 - characters right
49:52 - and then
49:53 - give me the lowercase and do dot dot dot
49:56 - and
49:57 - yeah perfect
49:59 - and of course we need the final
50:01 - condition so this is this is what
50:03 - happens if true then we need of what
50:05 - happens if false and we just need it to
50:07 - give us the name in lowercase because
50:09 - it's already small enough so there we go
50:12 - now you guys can see
50:13 - clever causey the cause man sugar shawn
50:15 - nastamansky a plastic plant so that's
50:17 - looking good
50:18 - now where i wrote stories we don't need
50:20 - that anymore so i'm just gonna remove
50:22 - that
50:24 - there's still a few problems with it so
50:26 - what i'm going to try to do is let's go
50:28 - ahead and give this a style
50:30 - i'll say align items
50:33 - it's the center there we go
50:35 - so now that just align things
50:39 - nicely right so for example if we take
50:40 - that away
50:41 - notice how
50:43 - all these are like too close to each
50:44 - other
50:45 - but then when i bring that back
50:48 - they move away from each other and give
50:50 - us the look and feel that we want and
50:51 - since it's a scroll view we're actually
50:53 - able to scroll this as well so with that
50:55 - said you guys
50:58 - uh we are pretty much done with the
51:00 - stories component okay so if you enjoyed
51:03 - that
51:05 - give us a nice little round of applause
51:08 - get that energy up in the freaking chat
51:10 - smash that like button right really get
51:11 - this thing freaking going
51:14 - awesome this is looking good let's move
51:16 - on to our next component okay so stories
51:19 - component i believe we're good with and
51:22 - what's our next component
51:24 - can you guess
51:26 - all right it's going to be this
51:27 - component
51:29 - now this is a massive component okay and
51:31 - it has multiple things it looks super
51:34 - simple when you look at it but there's
51:35 - actually a lot going on inside of here
51:37 - right so if i put this right there
51:40 - that's the next building block puzzle
51:42 - block that we're doing
51:46 - hey
51:48 - now
51:50 - this component has a lot of things so
51:52 - let me explain
51:53 - at the top
51:56 - let's see if my arrows are going to the
51:58 - right place
52:00 - all right there we go
52:02 - so at the top here
52:04 - this is gonna be a component called post
52:08 - header
52:09 - all right so let me
52:10 - see if i can show you what that looks
52:12 - like
52:15 - so it's wild right it's a post header
52:18 - right there
52:19 - all right so that's that component it's
52:22 - also gonna have another component which
52:24 - is going to be
52:27 - where is it showing up
52:29 - post image
52:31 - okay
52:32 - so there we go
52:34 - post image
52:36 - and then it also has post footer
52:39 - right so when you look at that one big
52:41 - component like this one that i'm
52:43 - highlighting it's made up of multiple
52:45 - sub components
52:47 - okay for example it's made up of post
52:49 - header it's made up of a post image and
52:52 - it's made up of a post footer so there
52:54 - are multiple things so i want you to
52:56 - start seeing react like that like
52:58 - building blocks legos so even though
53:00 - we're gonna be building this all in one
53:02 - file called post.js
53:04 - it's gonna have multiple sub components
53:06 - inside of it and you'll see how we do
53:07 - that
53:09 - all right let's get
53:11 - rid of all of these now
53:13 - so this is the screen we're gonna be
53:15 - building uh not screen but the post
53:17 - component we're gonna be building and
53:18 - i'm just gonna leave that at the bottom
53:20 - right here
53:21 - so you can see what we're doing
53:23 - cool
53:26 - so let's go inside of our home make a
53:29 - new component and this is going to be
53:30 - called post.js
53:38 - okay now post is also going to need its
53:41 - own fake data
53:43 - so we're we're going to create our dummy
53:44 - database and we're going to call it
53:46 - posts.js
53:48 - all right and we're just going to put
53:50 - our dummy data in here
53:52 - and that's what this will look like okay
53:53 - so we're importing
53:55 - the users from the users database
54:00 - okay
54:01 - right there
54:03 - and then posts are just this
54:05 - again if you're building this along with
54:07 - me yet yet you can add your own dummy
54:09 - data that looks like this
54:12 - or you can once you add data to the fire
54:15 - store when we do that later we'll add it
54:17 - to a real database and then we'll be
54:19 - retrieving it from there okay
54:21 - now
54:22 - what is post well post
54:25 - let's actually build bring up our post
54:28 - component right here right
54:29 - so let's just leave that on the right
54:31 - hand side for now hopefully i'll
54:32 - remember to take that off
54:34 - but
54:35 - if i look at my post component or
54:38 - actually this is the entire component
54:39 - right
54:41 - we need access to the user
54:44 - um
54:46 - you know who created the post so that's
54:48 - going to give us the information we need
54:50 - for the post header
54:53 - okay
54:54 - we of course need likes those are going
54:56 - to get rendered
54:58 - down
54:59 - here where you guys see them
55:02 - okay
55:05 - how do you
55:07 - there we go oh that's so much easier
55:09 - it's gonna get rendered like
55:11 - down there
55:14 - caption is going to get rendered out
55:16 - here your first thing
55:18 - profile picture is going to be the
55:20 - profile picture that you have at the top
55:23 - okay and then these are this is an array
55:26 - of comments
55:27 - which will have the user in the comment
55:29 - and the reason why you need it like that
55:30 - is so then
55:32 - you can show like it says here the cause
55:35 - man blah blah blah
55:36 - right so that is where that's coming
55:38 - from
55:41 - cool so that's what the data structure
55:43 - is like
55:45 - it's an array of objects so get used to
55:47 - that everything is always going to be
55:49 - array of objects any time you're dealing
55:51 - with an api almost always okay
55:54 - so object number one represents the
55:58 - first post with all of its comments
56:01 - and then object number two represents
56:03 - the second post
56:05 - with all of its comments
56:09 - okay there we go i hope that was clear
56:11 - great that's all that file is
56:14 - now let's come back to our post
56:16 - component we will do our usual we'll
56:18 - write post
56:20 - and we want to make sure that this is
56:21 - getting rendered
56:22 - so where do i need to go for that i need
56:24 - to go to my home screen because that's
56:26 - where it will
56:27 - be rendered
56:36 - right and then inside of here
56:39 - i want to be
56:40 - rendering it so for example i need to do
56:45 - post
56:49 - like this
56:51 - of course we need to import it so let's
56:53 - go ahead and remove the last character
56:55 - write it again and it'll suggest it okay
56:57 - and if it's not showing anything that's
56:59 - just because we might need to do color
57:02 - give it a white color and there you go
57:04 - now it's showing up so that's good this
57:07 - is a good starting point now we need to
57:08 - work on our post component and post
57:11 - component we're just going to start at
57:13 - bare bones for now with uh
57:16 - kind of as simple as we can make it okay
57:19 - so i'm going to just remove
57:22 - um yeah this is fine so post component
57:25 - is going to take in a post
57:28 - okay and then we're going to go do stuff
57:31 - with that particular post that we get so
57:33 - let's go to our home screen and what i
57:35 - want to do on the home screen
57:38 - is
57:39 - since post is gonna just render out one
57:41 - component we need to actually be able to
57:43 - like wrap it up in a loop and be able to
57:46 - show all of them so i'll show you how to
57:49 - wrap this up in a loop in just a second
57:52 - let's go back here and now let's work on
57:54 - this
57:59 - all right i'm gonna do this i'm gonna do
58:02 - margin
58:03 - bottom 30 because each of the posts
58:06 - should have some gaps in between each
58:08 - other
58:08 - that's what that'll allow us to do
58:11 - now i do want to use a divider so we're
58:14 - going to go divider
58:17 - okay and now divider we don't have so
58:19 - divider we're going to actually need to
58:21 - install
58:23 - we're going to need to install and we're
58:24 - going to do yarn
58:29 - add react native elements just like this
58:35 - that's
58:36 - okay
58:37 - so i'll zoom in just so you can see the
58:38 - command that i just wrote
58:41 - okay that's a bad zoom in because my
58:44 - stuff is hiding it but you get the point
58:47 - hit enter so it starts installing it
58:49 - you'll see the package name these are
58:51 - always the package names so whatever you
58:53 - see written out here is what you will
58:55 - need to install
58:59 - cool
59:05 - all right so now we're going to use the
59:06 - divider uh it's still not auto importing
59:08 - but that's fine so i'm going to just say
59:10 - import there we go thank you copilot
59:17 - all right
59:18 - so now this divider we're gonna give it
59:20 - a width of one
59:23 - and orientation we're gonna make it
59:28 - vertical
59:32 - cool
59:36 - unexpected token
59:38 - post oh we should be good now
59:41 - that's interesting
59:44 - what
59:45 - what just happened to my entire app
59:53 - there we go
59:55 - so now
59:56 - my app is actually showing up
59:59 - there we go so now yes so we can
60:01 - actually see the post that we wrote
60:03 - right it's showing up and this is the
60:05 - line that we need so that's that divider
60:08 - part that i added
60:09 - okay
60:10 - so that's
60:13 - so for now
60:14 - we're just all we're doing right now
60:15 - guys is just initializing post and then
60:18 - we're going to create the post header
60:25 - go post header
60:29 - all right this will also get access
60:32 - to the post
60:35 - and then we're just going to render out
60:36 - a view
60:39 - that view will contain
60:43 - another view
60:48 - which will contain an image
60:54 - and then we're going to have some text
60:55 - right next to that image
61:01 - all right
61:02 - um
61:04 - yeah so now we just need to actually
61:07 - start styling it
61:09 - okay so let's go ahead and
61:13 - what we'll do here is instead of having
61:16 - this written out right here i'm going to
61:17 - remove that and i'm just going to say
61:18 - post
61:20 - header
61:23 - we'll take in a post and then we just
61:25 - pass it it posts like this
61:28 - okay so now post header will have access
61:30 - to the post that we gave it
61:33 - we just need to import image
61:36 - great
61:40 - awesome
61:47 - okay so now this is the part where we
61:49 - actually need to start pulling real
61:51 - information from all of our posts
61:54 - so we're gonna go back to our home
61:57 - screen and we're gonna wrap this up in a
61:59 - loop and we're gonna make this home this
62:02 - post have access to
62:04 - everything
62:05 - so first of all we're going to make it a
62:07 - scroll view because we need to be able
62:09 - to
62:11 - uh scroll
62:13 - it's two l's i misspelled it
62:17 - and then let's also import scroll view
62:20 - so we're going to have the posts in a
62:22 - scroll view now inside of this view
62:24 - we're actually going to map this so
62:26 - we're going to say posts
62:28 - so boom we just imported it and i'm
62:30 - going to say
62:31 - dot map
62:32 - give it a post and an index
62:36 - okay
62:39 - there we go
62:42 - so now we're just looping through okay
62:45 - and this post will need access to the
62:47 - posts
62:49 - as well so how we do that is we go make
62:52 - the post equals to the post and then
62:54 - also we're going to give it a key which
62:55 - is going to be the index
62:59 - alright so now
63:00 - we're looping through and for every
63:02 - single post that we retrieve from
63:05 - post.js
63:07 - so we're gonna post one is gonna be this
63:08 - and this is gonna be the second post or
63:10 - post zero is gonna be this and the post
63:12 - one is gonna be this one
63:14 - okay and then we're just sending that
63:15 - off to our post component and then our
63:17 - post component
63:19 - is
63:20 - getting it and then doing stuff with it
63:23 - as simple as that
63:27 - boom boom
63:32 - all right
63:33 - so let's work on our post header now
63:36 - and make sure that everything is good to
63:37 - go so we're going to give it a style
63:39 - here
63:40 - and we're going to go flex direction
63:42 - and we'll go row
63:45 - we'll go justify content space
63:48 - between
63:52 - we'll go margin will be five
63:54 - and then align items will go center
63:59 - okay now we do need the images to show
64:01 - up so let's actually just give our
64:02 - images a source i'm gonna say uri is
64:05 - post.profile
64:08 - picture
64:13 - okay and now these of course will need a
64:16 - style as well and i'm just going to give
64:18 - it the same style as pretty much the
64:20 - stories because it's going to be
64:23 - uh pulling from there so we're just
64:24 - going to do styles
64:26 - styles
64:28 - dot story just like this and now i'm
64:30 - gonna cheat so i'm gonna not cheat but
64:32 - like i'm gonna go inside of my stories
64:34 - component and we're just gonna grab this
64:37 - exact styling right here we're going to
64:39 - go back inside of post
64:41 - we're going to paste that
64:42 - the only difference really is going to
64:44 - be we're going to make this smaller so
64:46 - we're going to make this 35 and 35 so
64:48 - it's not the big circle
64:51 - border radius is good
64:53 - that's good and border width will make
64:55 - it much smaller as well
64:58 - okay
65:00 - so now
65:02 - it says i don't know what a style sheet
65:04 - is or where you're getting it from so
65:06 - we're gonna do stylesheet
65:08 - and now it's imported
65:10 - there we go
65:11 - hey
65:13 - so now our headers are being made
65:17 - they're not looking perfectly like we
65:18 - want them to but
65:20 - they're showing up so that's good
65:28 - okay
65:29 - so now let's do a couple of more things
65:30 - right so now let's give this text
65:32 - uh this text is gonna have a color of
65:35 - white
65:39 - all right we're going to give it let's
65:40 - give it a margin left of 5 and then
65:43 - we're going to go font weight
65:46 - and i'm going to give it a 700 font
65:47 - weight
65:48 - and now let's give it some text so let's
65:50 - say hello
65:51 - and see what that looks like
65:53 - boom so each of these guys has hello
65:55 - coming out as you can see but we don't
65:57 - want it to say hello we actually want to
65:59 - say post.username
66:01 - or is it posts.user
66:04 - yes post.user
66:06 - and by default everything shows up in a
66:08 - column so remember in react native we
66:10 - actually need to put this in a row
66:13 - okay
66:15 - so let's go ahead and do that now so
66:17 - this view i'm just going to make i'm
66:19 - going to say style
66:21 - is flex direction
66:24 - row
66:25 - that should already do it and now we're
66:27 - going to align items center and that'll
66:30 - put it in the center like this
66:32 - okay
66:33 - so now this looks
66:36 - this looks reasonable and respectful
66:40 - okay this margin 5 if i remove that
66:42 - you'll see that
66:44 - the header is running into the divider
66:47 - that's not what we want we want margin
66:49 - five from every single direction so
66:52 - margin left margin top margin bottom and
66:54 - margin right so shorthand for that is
66:56 - just saying margin so if you do this
66:58 - right
67:01 - so it gets nice spacing from all
67:03 - directions and a good little hack you
67:06 - can use
67:09 - now all we need is the three dots
67:12 - showing up so if i take a look at this
67:15 - i have
67:16 - the clever quasi on the left hand side
67:18 - and then i have the three dots at the
67:21 - right hand side
67:22 - and chris o'brien says i posted it
67:24 - earlier but here it is which you need
67:26 - for the snippet extension install
67:28 - this is the extension so he's giving you
67:30 - guys the extension you need to install
67:31 - thank you for that
67:33 - so now we just need to put those three
67:35 - dots at the right hand side as well okay
67:39 - so let's go ahead and do that now
67:50 - okay so we're gonna make another review
67:57 - is it auto completing this for me jesus
68:05 - all right so we're gonna have another
68:06 - view
68:11 - all right and this is going to be a very
68:13 - simple one so actually let's try this
68:15 - without a view and let's see what this
68:17 - looks like so i'm just going to have
68:18 - text
68:20 - and then my text is just going to say
68:22 - this we're going gonna give it a style
68:25 - color white like this and look the three
68:28 - dots are actually showing up right so
68:29 - that's good now we just need to give it
68:31 - some font weight
68:32 - font weight
68:36 - boom there you go so guys our post
68:39 - header component
68:41 - i believe should be good to go we're
68:43 - done with the post header component now
68:45 - what we need to actually work on is our
68:47 - being able to pull and retrieve the
68:49 - image so that's what we're going to work
68:50 - on next okay hope you're enjoying it and
68:52 - having fun
68:54 - let's keep it
68:55 - rocking and rolling let's just highlight
68:58 - this real quick
69:01 - this is what we've got done so far
69:03 - um
69:06 - this is a scrollable view as you can see
69:08 - everything looks clickable because it
69:10 - has that touchable opacity
69:12 - right
69:14 - boom
69:15 - so there we go
69:17 - let's get out of this view
69:19 - let's go like this and let's keep
69:22 - rocking and rolling
69:23 - so post image is going to be the next
69:25 - thing that we're going to work on okay
69:27 - so i'm going to add
69:30 - another component now
69:32 - and i just want to take a look real
69:34 - quick
69:53 - okay
69:54 - so let's go ahead and work on this now
69:56 - okay so post header is done i'm gonna
69:58 - get outside of post header we're gonna
70:00 - do const post image
70:02 - and this is going to take in as well
70:05 - it's going to take in a post
70:08 - and then it's going to need to do stuff
70:09 - with that post that it gets okay and
70:12 - let's do an implicit return so implicit
70:14 - return is really the equivalent of you
70:17 - writing this and then you saying return
70:19 - and then you
70:20 - putting all your code inside of these
70:22 - parens
70:23 - so the nice easy way of doing it is just
70:26 - put this and that's the same thing as
70:28 - that all right
70:31 - so here i'm going to have an image and
70:33 - this image is going to have a source of
70:37 - host dot image url
70:41 - all right and then we're going to give
70:43 - it a style and the style is going to be
70:44 - very very simple for this one we're just
70:46 - going to give it a height of
70:49 - 100
70:50 - and we're going to go resize mode and
70:52 - we'll say cover
70:56 - and of course let's go and end this
70:59 - component so make sure you give it that
71:00 - slash like this so we got our image
71:03 - component in here
71:06 - now we just need to add the post image
71:08 - right underneath the post headers we're
71:10 - going to do post image
71:12 - post post
71:15 - there we go so the image is starting to
71:17 - show up it's not looking exactly like
71:19 - how we want it to
71:21 - and so let's work on that and fix that
71:27 - so we're gonna go
71:28 - and
71:30 - build a view here
71:32 - wrap the whole thing up in that view
71:35 - we're gonna go style
71:37 - and i'm gonna say with 100 percent and
71:40 - we're gonna go height 450
71:43 - and there you go
71:45 - now the image is looking like how we
71:48 - want it to look like
71:49 - so
71:50 - that's it and that looks great to me so
71:53 - the post image component
71:55 - is done you guys so we're done with that
71:58 - now we need to add and start working on
72:00 - the post footer so what is the post
72:02 - footer and if you're new here and you
72:04 - just came on welcome thanks so much for
72:06 - being on this live stream right now i
72:09 - really love your guys energy and i
72:10 - appreciate you guys being here this bill
72:12 - took us
72:15 - just so you guys know a little bit
72:16 - behind the process these bills take 100
72:19 - to 200 hours from me and my team and
72:22 - david and i worked on this for a long
72:24 - time and what takes a long time is not
72:26 - the build itself but we spend another 50
72:29 - to 100 hours
72:30 - making sure that every line of code is
72:33 - absolutely as clean as it can be it's as
72:36 - tightly refactored it can be as it can
72:39 - be so when you're watching this it is
72:41 - extremely clear and easy to understand
72:44 - okay so
72:45 - it goes through like a really solid
72:46 - refining process and it's distilled down
72:49 - and just super clean before we uh hand
72:52 - it off over to you okay so it's just a
72:55 - little bit behind the scenes
72:57 - i thought would be interesting for you
72:58 - guys
73:00 - boom
73:03 - all right so now let's work on and add
73:05 - the post footer
73:09 - so post footer is going to be
73:12 - fairly simple but here's one thing that
73:14 - you're going to need to do for it so
73:16 - inside of our post here
73:18 - i'm going to add all of these icons so i
73:20 - just did a copy pasta right now
73:22 - and that copy pasta is
73:26 - basically
73:28 - all of my icons that i'm going to need
73:30 - okay so these are all the icons that i
73:32 - need so i have a like icon a comment
73:35 - icon a share icon and a save icon
73:38 - and if you're wondering what that all of
73:39 - that looks like it'll look like
73:42 - this so at the top right there
73:50 - i make this even smaller so it doesn't
73:52 - really take up any space on the screen
73:54 - but the heart the comment the messenger
73:57 - and then those all the share the save
73:59 - icon right so all of those are right
74:00 - here
74:02 - and the way that is this is set up is
74:04 - you have the image url then you have the
74:06 - like damage url
74:07 - and the only one that has that is the
74:08 - like button because remember the like
74:10 - button turns red when you like a post so
74:12 - you're gonna need two different images
74:14 - for that
74:16 - everything else is straightforward again
74:18 - it's an array of objects so get used to
74:20 - that pattern very very common pattern
74:22 - you'll always see it all the time best
74:25 - to just get used to it
74:27 - so i got my icons now i'm going to do
74:30 - stuff with my icons
74:33 - all right let's go ahead and make our
74:35 - post footer component
74:38 - i'm going to go here const post footer
74:41 - okay and
74:45 - there we go
75:00 - all right
75:01 - so post footer
75:05 - uh let's give it an icon so let's make
75:07 - an icon component so post footer is
75:09 - going to have tons of icons inside of it
75:11 - okay so i'm going to make that component
75:12 - right now so we're going to do cons
75:14 - icon
75:15 - okay and we can even put that inside of
75:17 - post footer but that's fine this is a
75:18 - const icon
75:21 - all right
75:22 - and let's close this
75:27 - and i'm gonna go image
75:29 - style image url
75:40 - all right and then we're going to give
75:41 - it a touchable opacity
75:44 - opacity like this
75:47 - and then each image is going to be image
75:52 - style
75:57 - like that okay so now our icon component
76:00 - is made and now we're ready to use it
76:02 - inside of our post
76:04 - footer so let's go ahead and go icon
76:08 - and i'm going to say image style is
76:09 - equal to styles.footer icon
76:12 - so this footer icon styling we're going
76:15 - to need to make that and let's go ahead
76:17 - and do that right now so i'm going to go
76:19 - ahead and do this footer icon will be
76:21 - width of 33 and a height of
76:24 - 33.
76:27 - just like that
76:29 - okay now let's come back to our code
76:31 - where we were making our icon
76:36 - and let's give our icon an image url as
76:39 - well and the image is going to be post
76:41 - footer icons
76:43 - we're going to give it the first image
76:45 - which is that like
76:46 - image
76:50 - and then let's close it
76:52 - just like this
76:55 - let's give a
76:58 - let's make it an implicit return
77:02 - there we go
77:06 - okay
77:07 - so
77:09 - we have an icon
77:10 - that has
77:13 - um we give it an image style
77:16 - right and then the image url
77:18 - cool and then that shows it so now let's
77:21 - make post footer suppose we can actually
77:24 - see the post footer so let's go on top
77:26 - right here and let's now go ahead and
77:28 - add it so i'm going to say
77:30 - post footer
77:32 - and add it in like this
77:35 - complaining about touchable opacity not
77:37 - a problem just need to import it from
77:39 - the top touchable opacity
77:43 - there we go so now you can actually see
77:45 - the heart icon but it looks like it's
77:48 - too close so what we want to do is make
77:51 - it so it's not too close and by the way
77:53 - guys we're almost at a freaking thousand
77:54 - likes that's freaking awesome
77:59 - so post footer we're going to wrap it
78:02 - rub it
78:05 - all right we're going to go style and
78:06 - i'm going to go margin horizontal and
78:08 - we'll give it 15 we'll give it a margin
78:11 - top
78:12 - of 10.
78:14 - there we go so now the likes has a nice
78:17 - little margin from everything else that
78:19 - was going on
78:21 - and now let's go to our post footer
78:22 - component
78:24 - and uh we just need to add a couple of
78:26 - other things to it okay so
78:30 - let me go ahead and just make a few more
78:32 - icons okay
78:33 - boom boom
78:35 - now it's gonna complain hey i need a
78:37 - parent blah blah blah okay let's wrap it
78:39 - in a parent then
78:40 - not a problem okay doesn't need to freak
78:42 - out now you see that it's in a column we
78:45 - don't want that right we want this to be
78:47 - in a row so let's go flex
78:49 - direction and let's go row
78:52 - beautiful so that's looking good now we
78:56 - need to have
78:57 - uh these three icons in its own view and
79:00 - then the right one in its own view so
79:02 - let's wrap this bad boy in a view
79:05 - like this
79:07 - okay
79:10 - and we're gonna have left footer icons
79:13 - and then we're gonna have our
79:15 - you know essentially our right footer
79:18 - icon but we probably don't even need to
79:20 - uh say that it should just be
79:24 - good to go
79:26 - actually so let's go ahead and go
79:37 - let's create styling for our left footer
79:38 - icons so i'm gonna go
79:41 - left
79:43 - footer icons
79:44 - container
79:47 - and we'll go flex direction row
79:51 - and we'll give it a width of
79:54 - 32 percent
79:57 - and we'll go justify content and we'll
80:00 - go space between
80:03 - all right
80:04 - and let's give this
80:07 - a style
80:10 - of
80:12 - styles.left foot container
80:15 - there we go
80:16 - so it's wrapped in that left footer
80:18 - style thing that we wanted so that's
80:20 - good
80:22 - now each of these images we just have to
80:24 - change them slightly so i'm just going
80:25 - to replace this zero with the one the
80:28 - zero with the two
80:29 - and our images should be looking good
80:32 - now this image right here icon does not
80:35 - exactly look like the one that we have
80:38 - uh right around there
80:43 - right so
80:45 - we're gonna need to just add a slight
80:47 - bit of styling on this
80:50 - okay
80:52 - so let's go ahead and do that so share
80:54 - icon let's create a styling for that so
80:56 - i'm gonna go share icon
80:58 - we'll do transform
81:01 - we'll go rotate not 90 degrees but
81:03 - rather 320 degrees
81:06 - and then we'll go margin top and give it
81:08 - a negative three
81:11 - oh by the way guys i forgot to give a
81:13 - huge shout out so this app was built uh
81:16 - me
81:17 - david and amanath too so monitor
81:19 - actually did a lot of uh work as well on
81:21 - this
81:23 - we had uh but david and i
81:25 - well we had to sleepless nights no i'm
81:27 - kidding i'm kidding
81:29 - amanda had to sleep full nights
81:33 - he's not on here so i can say whatever i
81:35 - want
81:37 - oh he's still on here
81:38 - oh
81:41 - just realized that
81:43 - oh
81:44 - snap he was catching some z's sorry you
81:47 - guys can't see but i have them open on
81:48 - skype so i can communicate with them
81:51 - they'll sometimes help me with uh if we
81:53 - got donations
81:54 - um or if we're if our video is down
81:58 - and just give a huge shout out to them
82:00 - by the way guys they're very very
82:01 - helpful so i want to see some comments
82:02 - of positivity and love being dropped
82:05 - right now for amanath and david guys
82:09 - cool so um
82:11 - this is this looks good to me
82:14 - all right
82:15 - now we need to just give the share icon
82:18 - and put it in the right place
82:20 - so let's go ahead to our
82:24 - second icon
82:28 - right it's our icon 2 because this is
82:30 - our share icon and here's what we're
82:32 - going to do so this is a cool hack that
82:34 - i want to actually show you guys you can
82:35 - actually give it an array of styles so
82:38 - you can put a comma here like this and
82:41 - you can say styles
82:43 - dot share icon so now it's inheriting
82:46 - the styles of the footer icon and the
82:49 - styles of the share icon really cool
82:51 - neat trick
82:52 - you can do it like this very very nice
82:56 - so there you go that style is now
82:58 - showing up doing what we want it to do
83:00 - and of course now we just need to add
83:02 - the last guy
83:04 - so how are we going to do that well
83:06 - we're going to get out of this container
83:10 - and we'll go view
83:12 - and inside of this view i'll put in that
83:14 - icon
83:16 - we'll go image
83:18 - style styles.footer
83:22 - icon
83:23 - and then image url
83:26 - is going to be
83:28 - post footer3.imageurl
83:31 - so now you guys can see the bookmark
83:32 - showing up except i want it all the way
83:34 - at the end so there's a couple of ways
83:36 - we can do it right i think we should be
83:38 - able to do it with justify content
83:41 - uh space between here
83:43 - okay so that's one way of doing it i
83:45 - want to also show you another way of
83:46 - doing it
83:48 - so the other way of doing it is you can
83:51 - actually do
83:52 - give it a style and we can actually go
83:54 - align items
83:58 - and we can go flex
84:00 - end and we can give it a flex one as
84:04 - well
84:05 - so there
84:06 - so flex one basically tells it take up
84:09 - all of this space
84:11 - um and then when you say flex end it it
84:13 - actually moves it all the way to the end
84:15 - there so multiple ways of doing it i
84:17 - just wanted to show you different ways
84:20 - uh personally i like the space between
84:23 - one better
84:24 - but this is this is alright as well
84:27 - cool so
84:29 - our our footer reaction icons are
84:32 - looking good are doing
84:35 - what we want them to do
84:37 - now what we need to work on is we need
84:40 - to be able to show our likes
84:42 - right so we want to be able to actually
84:43 - grab the likes and show them because
84:46 - right now
84:47 - we're not able to uh
84:50 - show them so let's go ahead and do that
84:54 - so this component is going to be a
84:55 - pretty simple one you guys
84:59 - it's not going to be very complicated
85:02 - and i actually have to make a decision
85:04 - do i want to show you guys how to like
85:05 - refactor this code and make it even
85:07 - better or
85:09 - do we just skip it so give me a second
85:11 - here i'm just going to think that
85:12 - through real quick
85:13 - and see if i want to do that
85:29 - hey
85:40 - okay i think we're good with this for
85:43 - now to be honest because
85:46 - i think it's doing what we needed to do
85:48 - and we don't need to mess around with it
85:49 - too much
85:52 - okay
85:57 - oh okay okay okay okay okay
86:03 - so just one thing is post footer needs
86:06 - to take in icons okay that's kind of
86:08 - about it we don't really need to
86:09 - actually worry about that too much
86:16 - okay let's move on and work on our likes
86:19 - component okay we don't need to worry
86:20 - too much about refactoring right now
86:22 - so
86:23 - let's work on likes component and this
86:26 - component is still going to be inside of
86:28 - post footer
86:29 - all right but we just go all the way to
86:30 - the bottom
86:32 - and so we'll work on it here so i'm just
86:33 - going to say
86:34 - const likes
86:38 - oh wow thank you so much we just got
86:40 - another donation
86:42 - uh from darsh and darsh says hey really
86:45 - great work you're doing i know
86:47 - until vanilla js could you suggest some
86:49 - projects for manila.js to get an
86:50 - internship i'm in my second year
86:52 - um i would recommend that you don't
86:55 - worry too much that much about
86:57 - vanilla.js i think just go and start
86:59 - working on react it's okay like i think
87:01 - deeper understanding yes it can always
87:03 - help but i'd rather you just actually
87:06 - start doing javascript with react
87:09 - because there's gonna be a lot of things
87:10 - you're not gonna ever use again like dot
87:12 - inner html and bunch of other stuff that
87:15 - when you're using react you're not
87:17 - changing the dom
87:19 - in real time you know or the dot at like
87:22 - ad event listeners or whatever like
87:24 - you're gonna be using states and stuff
87:26 - so
87:27 - something just keep in mind
87:28 - cool we're almost at a thousand likes
87:30 - thank you guys so much for your love i
87:32 - appreciate it
87:33 - all right so the likes component is
87:34 - gonna be pretty simple it's gonna take
87:36 - in the likes or sorry it's gonna take in
87:37 - the post everything is gonna take in the
87:39 - post so that's one important thing for
87:40 - y'all to know okay everything is gonna
87:42 - take in the post
87:44 - now
87:46 - we are going to
87:49 - uh basically
87:51 - show each of the posts so that's going
87:53 - to be in a text tag
87:54 - and we're going to go
87:56 - post.likes.2 locale
88:00 - string
88:01 - and we'll do
88:02 - just like that
88:04 - and then we're going to close it
88:06 - now it's not showing up because remember
88:09 - text is also currently black so we need
88:12 - to actually change it to white
88:14 - and that'll help us show it and the
88:16 - other reason why it's not showing up is
88:17 - because we need to add it
88:19 - right here so we actually need to go and
88:21 - do
88:23 - and we can actually add it in the same
88:24 - view so right underneath here we just go
88:26 - likes and we give it a post
88:31 - there we go
88:33 - okay
88:37 - so let's go to our likes here
88:40 - right and now our likes are showing up
88:41 - on the screen so that's a good sign
88:43 - that's kind of what we want
88:45 - and now we need to actually give it
88:47 - further styling right so for the font i
88:49 - want to say
88:52 - font weight
88:56 - and let's go 600 on this bad boy
89:00 - okay so font is looking better and now
89:03 - we need to actually give it some styling
89:05 - and so let's put a view on top of this
89:10 - all right and we're gonna give it a
89:12 - styling of
89:15 - flex direction of row
89:19 - we'll go margin from the top should be
89:22 - four so like let's give it a little bit
89:23 - of margin from there
89:26 - and this looks good the only thing it
89:28 - doesn't say yet is the word likes so
89:30 - let's say that
89:32 - and now it says the word likes
89:34 - so
89:36 - 7870 likes it's actually being pulled
89:38 - directly from the post the next one
89:40 - let's see what that says also saying
89:42 - seven thousand eight hundred
89:43 - and blah blah blah likes
89:48 - cool let's go to posts
89:51 - yeah they both have the same image and
89:52 - the same amount of likes
89:55 - so we're gonna do something i'm gonna go
89:57 - in my uh i'm gonna go and
90:05 - posts
90:09 - uh-huh
90:16 - cool
90:27 - okay and then we'll soon be pulling in
90:29 - the information about the people as well
90:31 - okay so now like for example if i change
90:33 - the likes here
90:34 - to let's say like
90:36 - 3 500 likes right and i go down 3 500
90:40 - likes
90:41 - perfect
90:44 - let's go back into our post component
90:48 - cool so i believe likes are done guys
90:50 - that's it they were pretty
90:51 - straightforward they're simple so we're
90:53 - done with them now we need to add
90:55 - captions so the caption
90:57 - is the next part so where you say where
90:59 - you see it says clever quasi building
91:01 - the netflix clone with react.js this is
91:04 - going to be a fun build that's the
91:05 - caption so the caption is pretty much
91:08 - the same styling as the comments
91:10 - actually so once we do the caption the
91:12 - styling is gonna be pretty easy for
91:14 - uh comments
91:17 - so const caption
91:20 - and we'll do it'll take in a post
91:24 - and we will get a text
91:28 - and the text will say the post.user's
91:30 - name okay so let's just start with that
91:32 - real quick
91:34 - and let's go ahead and render a caption
91:36 - at the top
91:42 - caption give it a post
91:45 - all right and now it's not showing up of
91:47 - course because the styling on the text
91:50 - needs to be changed right so
91:53 - here's what we're gonna do
91:55 - i'm gonna give it a styling of color
91:59 - white
92:00 - there we go now the styling is showing
92:02 - up
92:03 - all right so now i'm going to show you
92:05 - guys something actually interesting so
92:06 - you can have text tags within text tags
92:09 - because we can't use
92:10 - span right so since we can't use the
92:13 - span tags
92:15 - we got to get creative with how we use
92:17 - the span tag so like almost imagine like
92:19 - i'm using a span tag right now but
92:21 - instead i'm just using a text tag
92:24 - okay because uh this is going to have
92:27 - like a special bolded text
92:29 - right and then this one is going to have
92:32 - user
92:33 - first one suppose that user and then
92:35 - we're going to have post dot caption
92:36 - like this
92:38 - right but the clever cause he actually
92:40 - needs to be bold
92:41 - all right so let's go ahead and let's go
92:44 - style and we'll go font weight i'll go
92:47 - 600 so now clever quasi is slightly
92:50 - bolder
92:51 - right
92:52 - and the next text
92:56 - so let's go here let's put it all in a
92:59 - view because it's too close to likes and
93:01 - we want to give it a little bit of
93:04 - a distance so i'm going to actually say
93:06 - here and we're gonna say
93:08 - style
93:10 - we'll go margin top and i'll add in five
93:13 - so now it's it's a little bit more
93:15 - breathable room
93:29 - okay i'm just gonna update the caption
93:31 - just so it looks
93:32 - a little bit better but this is just
93:34 - dummy stuff right now so you don't have
93:36 - to worry too much about it i'm just
93:37 - doing it for like
93:38 - aesthetics just for fun
93:40 - no no crazy uh
93:44 - reason all right let's go here paste
93:46 - that
93:47 - cool
93:49 - just so like we can also check the
93:50 - styling as well right like how does it
93:52 - read on multi-line because sometimes on
93:54 - multi-lines it might read incorrectly
93:59 - okay and now what we can do is we can
94:01 - actually just give even a slight margin
94:03 - so let's go back here
94:08 - okay margin
94:10 - and that way clever quasi and the rest
94:12 - of the stuff can have some amount of
94:14 - margin so let's actually try that let's
94:16 - go margin
94:19 - right five
94:30 - that's not doing that okay oops
94:38 - bold
94:43 - let's try here margin
94:46 - left five
94:50 - interesting okay so that doesn't work oh
94:52 - but what we can do is actually we can do
94:54 - a little hack
94:56 - all right
94:57 - so we can do a little hack we can
94:58 - actually just give a space like this
95:01 - so not here but inside of our caption
95:05 - there we go
95:07 - okay
95:11 - all right david you were right
95:13 - i was wrong
95:15 - that did
95:16 - catch me if the space was really obvious
95:19 - i would have caught it so like that
95:23 - okay there we go
95:25 - so
95:26 - you can make the space really obvious
95:28 - like that but here here it is okay so
95:30 - give that space
95:31 - and now you get that building the
95:32 - netflix clone with react.js and you're
95:35 - good to go okay so let's take a look at
95:37 - both of the com
95:38 - both of them they both look slightly
95:40 - different right the image is the same
95:42 - but other than that they should be good
95:48 - cool
96:04 - me
96:10 - all right and uh another thing that i'm
96:12 - gonna do is i'm just gonna update the
96:14 - dummy data just one last freaking time
96:17 - just so we can also have like my
96:19 - brother's posts in there and some
96:20 - different people's comments
96:22 - oh
96:23 - instagram is gonna be
96:24 - uh complaining which is super annoying
96:27 - actually
96:29 - uh david can you link me my brother's
96:32 - url in slack please
96:35 - instagram is annoying it just expires
96:37 - its links like every few days or
96:39 - something just so you can't be using
96:40 - their stuff all the time so let's grab
96:42 - like a new url here and we'll be good to
96:45 - go in just a few seconds
96:50 - all right so in terms of the caption
96:54 - though
96:56 - let's take a look in terms of caption
96:57 - guys we're honestly done there's not
96:59 - much more to do in caption like i'm just
97:02 - wasting time
97:03 - uh adding not wasting time but like just
97:05 - adding more aesthetics to the app i also
97:07 - think it's good for testing just so you
97:08 - can see like different images working
97:10 - and doing the things that they're
97:11 - supposed to do
97:12 - okay so we got the new image and let's
97:14 - see
97:16 - uh if this image
97:18 - works like how i want it to
97:22 - all right
97:23 - and it does not
97:27 - does it need to end in a jpeg or
97:29 - something david like dot png or jpeg or
97:32 - something like that
97:39 - do i do that 4k thing maybe at the end
97:41 - of it 4k
97:46 - slash 4k slash png will that work
97:50 - damn it that doesn't work
97:54 - okay
97:55 - cool well
97:56 - that link does not work david so if you
97:58 - can give me another link that'd be
97:59 - helpful
98:02 - all right so let's keep on going let's
98:04 - work on adding the comment section now
98:06 - okay so comment section is gonna be a
98:08 - little tricky okay so let's go ahead and
98:10 - do comments
98:12 - section
98:15 - post and when i say comment section
98:17 - right what i really am talking about
98:21 - is this and i'll show you in just a
98:22 - second so let's go post
98:25 - i'm going to try this one last time guys
98:26 - hopefully this works
98:29 - yes it does nice
98:30 - look at that
98:32 - that's beautiful perfect
98:34 - so let's go back
98:36 - and uh comment section is going to be
98:38 - this section right here
98:40 - so it's not the comments themselves it's
98:42 - a you see where it says view all two
98:44 - comments that's what that is
98:46 - meaning that
98:49 - if you have no comments that section
98:51 - will not show up at all but if you do
98:53 - have one comment it will say view one
98:56 - comment
98:57 - if you have multiple comments it will
98:58 - say view all to com
99:01 - view all two comments right so there's
99:03 - three different states that it could
99:05 - have if it's empty shouldn't exist if
99:06 - it's one it should say view one comment
99:08 - if it's multiple there's a view all
99:10 - comments so
99:11 - just takes a little bit of javascript
99:13 - jujitsu but we will
99:16 - work through it okay and you'll learn
99:18 - some dope javascript so let's go
99:20 - there's actually a really cool hack in
99:22 - this one that we figured out and we'll
99:24 - show you and probably even drop that as
99:26 - like a separate video at some point uh
99:28 - by itself
99:29 - so
99:30 - let's just do an implicit return because
99:32 - i don't need to do anything else so
99:35 - all right so here we go here's the text
99:37 - that we want right so text
99:39 - and i'll just say hi for now
99:42 - we'll give this a
99:44 - color of gray actually so it needs to
99:46 - look gray now we're gonna
99:48 - add this comment section right
99:50 - underneath here so i'm just gonna say
99:52 - comments section give it the post
99:55 - so the high is showing up as you can see
99:57 - at the bottom
100:00 - all right now what we do want to
100:02 - do
100:04 - is we want to be able to say
100:06 - hey check the comments length right so
100:10 - something like this so we want to be
100:12 - able to say something like that so i
100:13 - just wrote this line right now and
100:15 - basically it says hey if the comments
100:17 - length is greater than one then say
100:18 - comments
100:19 - otherwise say comment
100:22 - okay so for example if i go back to my
100:26 - well actually let's read out the
100:29 - comments themselves as well real quick
100:32 - oh no that's the next part that's the
100:34 - next part okay so let's test it now
100:36 - right if i go right here
100:38 - and um
100:42 - and i remove one of the things it should
100:43 - go from plural comments to singular
100:45 - comments i'll remove one of the posts
100:48 - now it says comment right we add it
100:50 - again now it says comments so to me this
100:53 - looks like the way that we're checking
100:55 - the length and whether we're going to
100:56 - make the comments or comment is is good
101:13 - okay
101:14 - and now what we want to do
101:16 - so let's write that word here right so
101:18 - this is not the actual view component
101:20 - this is the word view so now we can say
101:23 - view
101:24 - and we also want to determine whether we
101:26 - want to use the word all or not okay so
101:28 - the way that we're going to do that is
101:30 - by this
101:32 - javascript
101:34 - snippet okay right there
101:36 - and what this is basically saying
101:39 - is if the comments length is greater
101:41 - than one
101:42 - then say the word all
101:44 - otherwise don't say any words at all
101:47 - okay
101:48 - and then this will actually say
101:51 - so if i remove this it won't save you
101:53 - all two comments i'll just say view all
101:54 - comments so if i add this part back now
101:56 - it says view all two comments okay so
101:59 - this is the number
102:01 - this is whether we're going to say the
102:02 - word all or not and this is whether
102:04 - we're going to say comments or just
102:05 - comment
102:08 - okay
102:09 - cool
102:10 - and a last case scenario that we
102:12 - actually want to account for so remember
102:13 - we have three cases right one is
102:16 - um
102:18 - zero comments
102:21 - so there's a zero comments case right so
102:23 - zero comments
102:29 - so in the zero commons case
102:31 - don't render
102:33 - component
102:36 - okay
102:37 - in the
102:41 - one comment
102:43 - basically what you want to do is
102:46 - render a component and also say and and
102:49 - and make the word
102:50 - um
102:54 - yeah without the word all
102:58 - and uh singular
103:01 - comment right
103:03 - and then in the last case
103:05 - you render
103:08 - with the word all and you say
103:11 - plural
103:13 - comments these are the three case
103:15 - scenarios right so right now we
103:16 - accounted for these two with this
103:18 - snippet of code now we need to account
103:20 - for this last one which is the trickiest
103:22 - one actually it doesn't seem like it but
103:25 - i'll show you why that's the case so
103:27 - first thing actually we're gonna do is
103:29 - i'm just gonna for styling i'm just
103:31 - gonna add a little bit of margin to the
103:33 - top
103:34 - like this
103:36 - go down here and we'll paste so now i
103:38 - just have some margin so it's it's a
103:40 - little it looks nice right looks like
103:41 - real instagram now we gave it that
103:43 - little
103:44 - uh gap from the from the caption
103:49 - okay
103:51 - now
103:52 - we're gonna make this a conditional
103:55 - render and how we're gonna make this a
103:57 - conditional render is the following way
104:01 - okay so i'm gonna basically say
104:03 - if post.comments.length
104:07 - then
104:10 - render this whole thing
104:17 - there you go so now it's wrapped in a
104:19 - conditional
104:20 - all right so let's go back to our posts
104:23 - and if i remove this comment
104:25 - it will say view one comment if i add it
104:28 - again it will say view all two comments
104:30 - so that's good but what happens if i
104:32 - remove all the comments
104:34 - it crashes
104:37 - and the reason why it crashes this is
104:39 - pretty weird
104:41 - is posa commons.length
104:43 - actually brings back a
104:47 - number
104:48 - okay so let me just explain this here so
104:50 - post.comments
104:52 - dot length actually gives you a number
104:55 - right so that number is gonna say zero
104:57 - or one or two or three like that
105:00 - right
105:01 - so
105:02 - the
105:04 - truthy value of zero
105:07 - is
105:09 - false
105:14 - all right
105:16 - uh man this is this is gonna be weird to
105:18 - explain but yeah because it's it's
105:19 - pretty tricky the true d value of one is
105:22 - true
105:23 - so when
105:24 - uh this is one
105:26 - it goes i'm true
105:28 - and so then do this
105:31 - but when it goes zero it goes i'm not
105:33 - true
105:34 - so then it tries to do just this part
105:37 - and when it tries to do just this part
105:39 - it goes hey you're writing the word zero
105:41 - but it's not within the text components
105:43 - so what do you want me to do when i just
105:44 - have a zero here to render
105:46 - it has no idea just freaks out it says
105:48 - text strings must be rendered within a
105:49 - text component
105:52 - uh but if this was the word false
105:56 - it would do nothing super freaking weird
105:58 - okay super freaking weird so if you
106:00 - literally had
106:01 - a thing that was rendered saying false
106:03 - here it will work but if you had a zero
106:05 - here it would not work
106:08 - so bizarre okay really really bizarre
106:11 - so
106:13 - the hack there
106:14 - is you want to make this zero
106:16 - uh either be a false or a true you don't
106:19 - want it to be a number so for example
106:22 - i don't want this to render to one or
106:24 - two or three or four
106:26 - i just either wanted to say true or
106:28 - actual word false and so the hack to do
106:31 - that and turn it into true or false is i
106:33 - just do the same thing post the comments
106:35 - on length
106:36 - and this is a dirty dirty hack
106:39 - but put double negations if you put
106:41 - double negations now if you have zero
106:43 - comments it will work and it is so
106:46 - bizarre
106:47 - and it doesn't show right look at that
106:49 - didn't crash
106:50 - if you have experience with javascript
106:52 - you should really enjoy this part i
106:54 - really enjoyed this part i was like yo i
106:56 - finally understand what double negation
106:58 - is it's the craziest freaking thing
107:01 - so yeah double negation is a
107:04 - uh bizarre one
107:06 - you could do a ternary operator way but
107:08 - this is just cooler
107:10 - and this nn approach is very very common
107:12 - when you're reading code everywhere
107:14 - they'll do this this way because
107:16 - it's just nicer and you don't have to
107:18 - say or null
107:19 - so this looks nicer
107:22 - but yeah so double negation will just
107:27 - turn whatever you have into a true or
107:29 - false and expose that things
107:31 - through the value so there you go
107:34 - now this section will work and with that
107:36 - said we are good with the comment
107:38 - section
107:40 - okay
107:41 - beautiful
107:42 - nice you're doing a great job right now
107:44 - if you've made it so far i know this is
107:46 - hard and it takes a lot of time
107:49 - but i'm proud of you for being here
107:51 - there's still 218 of you live so thank
107:54 - you so much for that and thank you so
107:55 - much for your support comments
107:57 - encouragement
107:58 - uh it really really helps i appreciate
108:00 - all of you
108:02 - let's get rocking and rolling
108:06 - now we're going to add the comments
108:08 - component and comments will show the
108:11 - actual comment so for example where it
108:13 - says the cosmetic wow this build looks
108:14 - fire super excited about this that's the
108:16 - actual comments section now
108:19 - all right so let's go and
108:21 - work on that
108:22 - const
108:24 - comments
108:26 - we'll do post
108:29 - do like this
108:33 - all right and then inside of here
108:38 - i will map through all the comments that
108:39 - i have
108:42 - i'll grab the index
108:52 - all right and uh
108:53 - within this loop i'll write down what i
108:56 - need to write down so we'll make a view
108:59 - within this view we'll add a text
109:02 - and the styling is going to be the same
109:04 - as
109:08 - the styling is going to be same as
109:12 - the caption so it's gonna look very
109:13 - similar i'm gonna be using the
109:16 - the same techniques here so we're gonna
109:19 - do color
109:20 - style we're gonna say color is white
109:24 - okay
109:25 - um and literally the the rest of it is
109:28 - going to be the same
109:34 - so the user is going to be bold so we're
109:37 - going to do style i'm going to say
109:40 - font weight is going to be 600.
109:45 - okay
109:47 - and then the other part is just going to
109:49 - say comment dot comment
109:53 - so why comment a comment because
109:58 - uh comments is this thing here
110:01 - and uh comment is this one object here
110:05 - and comment.comment is this guy right
110:08 - there that's why
110:12 - boom boom boom
110:14 - all right so that looks good of course
110:16 - we need to give this a index
110:20 - we're also going to give it a styling
110:22 - but let's give it a styling in just a
110:24 - second let's just go render it out right
110:25 - now and
110:27 - let's see what we look like so we go
110:29 - comments give it a post and there we go
110:31 - all our comments are showing up okay
110:35 - so our comments are not showing up
110:38 - the only problem is that they have a
110:40 - certain
110:41 - things with styling so let's go and fix
110:43 - them so this comment right here i'll
110:44 - give a space
110:47 - okay can we go
110:49 - and make it very obvious like this yes
110:52 - we can
110:53 - so there we go so you put a space there
110:55 - and that'll give a space between the
110:58 - user's name and then their comment
111:00 - itself
111:02 - okay and now this view we're gonna just
111:04 - give it is slight styling
111:11 - so right here i'm actually just gonna
111:13 - say style and we're gonna give it a flex
111:15 - direction
111:16 - of
111:19 - okay row we're gonna go margin top five
111:23 - so each comment now has slight margin
111:27 - uh between each other
111:29 - perfect
111:31 - so comments component is looking good
111:33 - you guys honestly we're done with the i
111:35 - mean we're going fast we're going
111:37 - freaking quick here we're done with the
111:39 - comment
111:40 - uh components
111:51 - there we go
111:52 - nice so if you guys are enjoying this so
111:54 - far again break that like button we're
111:57 - so freaking close to 1000 likes
112:00 - um and yeah appreciate you guys let's
112:03 - keep going so what are the next things
112:05 - that we need to add so this is looking
112:06 - pretty good
112:12 - now let's work on our bottom tabs
112:14 - component okay so what is this bottom
112:15 - tabs component you're talking about kazi
112:18 - i'll show you
112:19 - so let's get rid of our post footer
112:21 - bottom tabs component is this guy right
112:23 - here that's the next one that we're
112:25 - gonna build okay and bottom tabs is
112:28 - going to go and sit right here you
112:31 - guessed it right at the bottom
112:33 - just like that
112:36 - okay
112:38 - um
112:39 - kind of like that yeah i don't
112:42 - i hope
112:42 - i'm doing it in a way where it looks
112:45 - like it's actually there
112:49 - yeah so pretty much like that so let's
112:51 - work on it now i'll just leave it here
112:53 - so you guys can see this the whole time
112:55 - and we're gonna code this thing up now
112:59 - so it's a new component and now we're
113:01 - going to go inside of home
113:05 - new file and we're going to call it
113:07 - bottomtabs.js
113:10 - all right
113:12 - and uh
113:13 - there's a lot of stuff that's gonna be
113:15 - added into here guys so
113:18 - buckle up this one is gonna be a fun one
113:22 - bottom tabs great
113:24 - so first things first we need access to
113:27 - all of those variables right so i'm just
113:29 - going to
113:31 - copy them
113:34 - okay and we're going to paste them here
113:39 - all right so what is all of this these
113:40 - are just bottom tab icons all right we
113:43 - got the home icon for the bottom left
113:45 - one we got the search icon
113:48 - oh they're opening up okay we got the
113:51 - search
113:52 - icon we got the reels
113:59 - uh zenology says how did you get this
114:01 - good i
114:03 - practice and code a lot so even if you
114:07 - see my last week it's um
114:10 - pretty ridiculous and i've been doing
114:12 - this for years now
114:13 - so
114:15 - you know this is this is probably just
114:18 - my last week
114:21 - right so this is just one week 44 hours
114:24 - in the last seven days there's probably
114:26 - more that i didn't that they didn't even
114:28 - log
114:29 - but yeah
114:31 - so
114:33 - yeah there's there's a lot of coding
114:35 - happening right like eight hours 54
114:36 - minutes on thursday uh
114:39 - seven hours 36 minutes on saturday
114:43 - three hours on october sunday so like
114:45 - every day
114:47 - there's a lot of actual and and keep in
114:50 - mind walka time records not the time
114:52 - you're thinking not the time you're
114:54 - white boarding not the time you're
114:56 - walking outside and thinking about how
114:57 - you're going to solve the problem not
114:58 - the time where you're like dreaming
115:00 - about the code
115:02 - it's logging just the time where you're
115:04 - actually physically typing code right
115:07 - that's what it's showing so
115:10 - the reason why i'm showing this to you
115:11 - guys is not to like discourage
115:14 - uh but to encourage right like these are
115:16 - the last 14 days to show you that it's
115:19 - not that i am good it's that i just
115:21 - practice this a lot you know and
115:24 - and maybe i'm practicing this maybe more
115:26 - than you okay so
115:29 - this so just make sure that you know you
115:32 - can do this trust me you just need to
115:34 - spend time coding okay spend a ton of
115:37 - time
115:37 - coding
115:39 - every freaking day you know as much as
115:41 - you can and you start getting better
115:42 - like coding yes it is hard it is tricky
115:46 - and these concepts take a long time to
115:48 - grasp but like
115:49 - you're gonna get pretty good at
115:50 - javascript if you spend 72 hours in
115:53 - freaking two weeks right i don't maybe i
115:55 - didn't even have it enabled before two
115:57 - weeks so it doesn't have that but i just
115:59 - have the last two weeks uh enabled
116:02 - so yeah
116:03 - that's there's literally no secret all
116:05 - right it's just hours coding how much
116:08 - time are you spending
116:10 - uh you should be able to see that
116:12 - so hopefully that was helpful for you
116:23 - all right beautiful uh david can we clip
116:26 - that one that was actually pretty sick
116:28 - so just time stamp that moment please
116:29 - and clip it because that could that
116:31 - could be an awesome video
116:36 - yeah a lot every day yes sir
116:39 - okay so i got all my bottom tab icons
116:42 - right here guys and now notice that i
116:44 - have the active and the inactive ones
116:46 - and what's the point of active or
116:48 - inactive well it's simply because
116:50 - when you click at the bottom home versus
116:52 - the search right which one this switch
116:55 - to which one is active and which one
116:57 - isn't so that's
116:59 - that's why we need the two different
117:00 - icons one that's
117:02 - the fill one and then the one that's
117:04 - like unfilled
117:06 - beautiful sorry it's filled right there
117:08 - you see that cool
117:11 - so
117:12 - every icon has an active or an active
117:14 - state and we're going to need to be
117:15 - managing that state all right so when
117:18 - we're managing states
117:19 - i'm thinking
117:21 - we're going to need to import use date
117:24 - so i just imported it here because we're
117:25 - going to need that
117:27 - and we're also going to need a couple of
117:30 - other
117:31 - things in order to be able to
117:33 - do this one
117:35 - so i'm going to import divider because
117:37 - you're going to need it so let's go
117:38 - divider
117:40 - all right from react native elements
117:44 - it's going to be that like little line
117:46 - at the top
117:49 - and other than that let's just get into
117:51 - it and then we'll import things as
117:53 - needed
117:54 - okay
117:55 - this is a heavy commit this is a heavy
117:57 - one so let's go through this
117:59 - all right so bottom tabs will take in
118:02 - icons
118:07 - all right and it will also need to
118:09 - manage certain states we're going to go
118:10 - active tab set
118:12 - active
118:15 - tab
118:17 - and we're going to go and give it home
118:19 - okay so the default one is going to be
118:21 - home
118:22 - now we're going to create another
118:23 - component called icon
118:26 - and
118:27 - this will
118:29 - do the following
118:36 - this will
118:38 - have an image
118:41 - okay and each of those images is going
118:43 - to be wrapped in touchable opacity to
118:45 - make it a button so whenever i'm making
118:47 - a button i just i usually just wrap it
118:49 - untouchable opacity now there's this new
118:51 - api thing that they release called
118:53 - pressable so maybe that might be the way
118:55 - to go look into it but
118:57 - the regular way is just anything that
118:59 - needs to be a button wrap that thing and
119:00 - touchable opacity and you should be good
119:02 - to go
119:05 - nice
119:11 - yeah
119:13 - okay okey dokey so wrapping this in such
119:16 - an opacity now
119:18 - we need to now show these icons
119:22 - okay
119:23 - so
119:27 - there's a lot going to be going on here
119:28 - okay so let's do this so on press
119:31 - what i want to do
119:35 - is set the active tab
119:37 - to icon.name
119:40 - okay
119:42 - okay and now let's just see if we can
119:44 - actually
119:48 - show these icons
119:51 - bottom tabs
119:54 - so let's go to our home screen and let's
119:55 - just show them so let's go to home
119:57 - screen and i'll add bottom tabs in the
120:00 - safe area view
120:05 - bottom tabs
120:14 - like this
120:17 - and you're gonna give it the icons
120:21 - and uh this is gonna be the only kind of
120:23 - annoying part that you're gonna you guys
120:25 - are gonna need to do
120:26 - so let's import them
120:29 - so like
120:30 - we're making the icons here but we're
120:32 - never using them in this file
120:35 - we're using them in the home screen by
120:37 - importing them so bottom tab icons
120:40 - bottom tab icons are being imported
120:44 - and bottom tabs will also need to auto
120:47 - import this so there we go import bottom
120:49 - tabs and bottom tab icons from that
120:52 - i know it's weird but it's just because
120:53 - i don't want to make the home screen
120:55 - super bloated i also wanted to show you
120:56 - how to import and export stuff around
120:59 - because very useful skill to have when
121:01 - you're working with react
121:03 - all right so bottom tabs takes in
121:05 - certain icons we're giving it those
121:07 - icons
121:09 - let's go back
121:12 - it's being used
121:16 - all right
121:19 - and then let's just render them out
121:34 - all right so i'm just gonna loop through
121:36 - each icon so we're gonna go
121:38 - icons.map
121:40 - and we're gonna go icon index
121:48 - and i'm gonna go icon key
121:52 - index
121:53 - icon icon
121:58 - okay
122:00 - so pretty soon we're going to start
122:02 - seeing these icons okay but what we need
122:04 - to do is
122:06 - make our icon component actually be able
122:08 - to show these images so we're gonna go
122:10 - source
122:11 - uri
122:14 - and let's just go icon dot
122:17 - active for now or inactive for now
122:22 - let's give it a certain size
122:25 - so we'll go style
122:34 - um we'll make styles dot icon
122:40 - styles
122:42 - all right and let's go down here and
122:44 - let's create a style sheet and we're
122:47 - going to go stylesheet
122:49 - dot
122:50 - create
122:53 - and we'll go icon
122:55 - and icon will have the following styles
122:58 - it's going to have a width of 30
123:00 - and a height of 30.
123:04 - so look at that all the icons are now
123:06 - showing up at the bottom
123:08 - they don't look super pretty but they're
123:10 - showing up so that's good
123:12 - now let's actually give a create a
123:15 - container that'll contain all these
123:17 - icons
123:18 - so we'll go container i'm going to go
123:20 - flex direction row remember because i
123:23 - need them to show up in a row
123:26 - all
123:26 - right um
123:30 - let's put a comma here
123:34 - and why this is not taking place is
123:36 - because we need to actually
123:37 - wrap
123:38 - this up in that style
123:41 - so we will go
123:45 - style equals styles.container
123:50 - it's already an object so we don't need
123:52 - to put two squigglies there
123:57 - there we go so now you can see the icons
123:59 - are actually showing up at the bottom
124:02 - they're showing up in a row that's good
124:04 - now we need to give them some spacing um
124:06 - between them right so we're gonna go
124:08 - not space around but we're gonna go
124:09 - space
124:10 - actually space around should be fine
124:14 - let's go space around
124:19 - so space between pushes them too far out
124:21 - to the edge right and we don't want it
124:22 - that far out to the edge so let's go
124:24 - space around on this
124:29 - hey
124:30 - beautiful guys this is awesome thank you
124:33 - so much we just smashed a thousand
124:37 - freaking likes
124:38 - so huge shout out for that thank you
124:40 - guys appreciate the support appreciate
124:42 - the love let's keep on rocking and
124:44 - rolling
124:48 - all right
124:49 - so here's what we want to do now
124:52 - let's give it a height
124:54 - of 50 and padding top
124:57 - of 10.
125:00 - cool
125:02 - okay so it's starting to look
125:08 - starting to look good so notice that
125:09 - when i give it a padding it it pushed
125:11 - the stuff down
125:13 - right
125:15 - and when the height is too small it's
125:17 - too small so we want to give it a height
125:18 - so it's like a little bit bigger
125:21 - right
125:23 - and now we want to start doing a couple
125:26 - of things we need to actually give
125:29 - there's some dynamic styling in here
125:31 - that we're going to do as well so be
125:33 - ready for that but first let's actually
125:35 - put all of this in a wrapper
125:40 - okay
125:44 - uh and what this wrapper is gonna do so
125:46 - we're gonna actually create a wrapper on
125:48 - top of all of this
125:50 - okay so here's what we're gonna do we're
125:51 - gonna go view
125:54 - and we're also gonna put a divider line
126:00 - and for the divider
126:03 - we'll go with of one
126:05 - orientation
126:07 - vertical
126:10 - uh
126:12 - why vertical i never understood
126:14 - because it's always horizontal but
126:17 - vertical just makes it a little bit
126:18 - thinner
126:20 - so
126:21 - go figure i have no idea how to explain
126:23 - that but that's
126:25 - that's the divider documentation so go
126:26 - yell at them don't yell at me
126:33 - sheesh
126:35 - yo guys can i get like
126:37 - just in the comments just like sheesh
126:41 - you know what i'm saying let's get the
126:42 - comments popping a little bit
126:45 - i could use some tea
126:48 - now let's go style
126:50 - and we'll go
126:53 - styles.rapper
126:55 - okay kinda like snoop dogg
126:57 - there we go
126:58 - so the wrapper it gave it a um so the
127:01 - wrapper we're gonna make it so it gives
127:03 - a position absolute soon okay we're
127:05 - gonna do that soon
127:07 - not doing that yet
127:10 - that's jesus
127:12 - all right
127:21 - [Laughter]
127:23 - the top comment by
127:25 - that's funny it's hilarious
127:29 - thank you for the energy i need this
127:31 - energy let's go you're the best
127:34 - coding sneaky sheesh
127:37 - guys six hours x am this many hours of
127:40 - coding live under all of this crazy guys
127:42 - so like i need your energy right now i
127:45 - need that
127:46 - food for me
127:48 - thanks for the love i appreciate every
127:50 - single one
127:52 - cool so we got this view where we're
127:54 - doing
127:55 - our tabs are showing up now we just need
127:57 - to
127:58 - do a couple of
128:00 - um you need to do slight little touches
128:03 - okay and one thing we need to do is
128:06 - based on which icon we click it should
128:08 - become active
128:10 - all right
128:13 - so let's go ahead and do that now
128:16 - so right now i'm just hard coding the
128:18 - inactive image right but here's what the
128:20 - active image would look like
128:24 - so now they're all have that fill going
128:26 - through it but we need to make this a
128:28 - dynamic thing and how we make this a
128:30 - dynamic thing is like this basically
128:33 - what i want to
128:34 - say is
128:37 - if the active tab
128:39 - is currently
128:41 - the
128:42 - icon.name that's selected
128:46 - then give me active or
128:48 - give me
128:50 - the
128:51 - inactive
128:53 - all right
128:54 - so
128:55 - this is now working look at that
128:57 - everyone i click is showing up
129:00 - okay so it says hey the current one
129:02 - you've clicked if it matches that
129:04 - specific icon then make then give me the
129:07 - active url for it otherwise give me the
129:09 - inactive url for it
129:11 - there we go
129:13 - okay so the active tab is keeping this
129:16 - is what's changing the state when we do
129:18 - on press
129:21 - beautiful
129:30 - where did he get the users array at
129:31 - stories.js there is i have a folder
129:34 - called data
129:35 - inside of it i have
129:38 - users
129:40 - so that's where it's at i'm getting it
129:42 - from right there
129:45 - okay
129:50 - beautiful
129:52 - so that functionality is now working and
129:54 - doing
129:57 - what we wanted to do
129:59 - now let's go ahead and
130:03 - work on
130:04 - some additional functionality on this
130:06 - okay so this is going to be slightly
130:09 - tricky but when we click the profile so
130:11 - first of all profile picture we need it
130:13 - to be round
130:14 - so let's go ahead and do that
130:18 - oh and let's style the wrapper as well
130:20 - guys style this wrapper
130:22 - so we're gonna go position and we can do
130:25 - absolute we're gonna go with and we can
130:28 - do hundred percent
130:30 - go bottom
130:32 - three percent
130:33 - and let's go z index 999 so it's always
130:37 - on the top i'll go background color and
130:40 - we'll give it
130:41 - that's the color we'll give it
130:44 - there we go
130:45 - so now it's guaranteed always going to
130:46 - be on top okay
130:51 - cool
130:55 - all right
130:56 - beautiful
131:10 - all right
131:15 - let's go ahead and style this now so we
131:17 - go profile pic
131:20 - and here's what we're gonna do
131:26 - let's give it a border radius of 50.
131:28 - let's give it a border
131:31 - uh
131:31 - we'll we'll look at that in a second and
131:34 - a border color of
131:36 - white
131:39 - all right
131:40 - and i'm gonna take away this arrow
131:42 - function just for a second just to make
131:43 - it a regular profile pic like this and
131:45 - now we're gonna go to our profile and
131:47 - give it a styling okay so we're gonna
131:50 - need to add a
131:52 - conditional statement that
131:54 - asks us if it's our profile picture so
131:56 - here's what we're going to do
131:58 - profile picture needs to inherit the
132:00 - styles of the icon
132:02 - plus
132:03 - the styles of the profile pic so
132:06 - immediately what i'm thinking is i'm
132:08 - thinking it's going to be an array
132:11 - right it's going to be an array
132:13 - of styles like this
132:15 - and the second array is going to be a
132:17 - conditional
132:19 - okay it's gonna be the second array is
132:20 - gonna second item and there is gonna be
132:22 - a conditional one so we're gonna say
132:25 - if the icon name
132:27 - is profile
132:31 - then what i want you to do is
132:35 - styles up profile
132:37 - pic
132:39 - otherwise give me back null styling so
132:41 - notice that the profile pic styling is
132:44 - now being added here
132:45 - but not added to these other ones right
132:47 - because if i remove this conditional
132:49 - statement
132:51 - and i just hard code this in there now
132:53 - everything is going to have the circular
132:55 - thing which
132:56 - actually you can't see but trust me it's
132:59 - a circular thing that now all of them
133:00 - have
133:01 - so we don't want that
133:04 - we just want it to be like this
133:07 - okay
133:08 - and now we also need to worry about the
133:11 - styling of when we click it so this is
133:13 - the styling of just the profile icon
133:15 - itself but now we need the styling for
133:18 - when we click it so we need to now do
133:19 - dynamic styling so how we're going to do
133:21 - that is profile pic
133:23 - is going to take in
133:25 - active tab
133:28 - or it will be by default it'll be empty
133:30 - like this
133:31 - okay and we will make it a function so
133:34 - this is really cool
133:36 - you can do dynamic functions uh
133:38 - dynamic styling like this
133:41 - and what i'm gonna say is
133:43 - border width should depend on if the
133:45 - active tab is
133:47 - profile
133:49 - if it is then give me a width of 2
133:51 - otherwise give me the width of 0.
133:56 - now active this is a function or a
133:59 - method so we're gonna put dot profile
134:01 - pic
134:02 - open close parentheses like this
134:05 - okay
134:06 - now
134:07 - it's
134:09 - complaining
134:13 - oh
134:16 - wait but default should be empty
134:21 - oh oh yes yes yes active tab
134:25 - wait where did i write active i wrote
134:27 - active somewhere oh yes yes yes yes
134:29 - right here active tab
134:32 - typo
134:33 - cool there we go
134:38 - so there we go okay
134:41 - now it's getting the styling but here's
134:43 - we're gonna be here's the fun part now
134:46 - if the active tab
134:48 - is profile
134:52 - and the
134:53 - icon name is the active tab
134:57 - which you've clicked on so basically
134:59 - which if you what you've clicked on is
135:00 - the profile icon
135:03 - then i want you to do the following
135:05 - give me
135:07 - profile pic and pass it the active tab
135:11 - otherwise give me back nothing
135:15 - okay so now we have a array of styles
135:19 - the first one
135:21 - just gets me
135:22 - regular styles the second one
135:24 - gets me the styles for profile
135:27 - and then the third one
135:30 - gets me the styles for profile when
135:32 - profile is clicked
135:34 - so watch this when i click profile now
135:37 - it becomes white look at that
135:41 - right such a nice little touch guys i
135:44 - hope you enjoyed that one
135:46 - i enjoy these like
135:48 - javascript parts that are just clean
135:53 - nice mustache
135:58 - awesome
136:03 - okay so we are good to go with this
136:18 - all right so in terms of the bottom tabs
136:20 - i believe guys we might be just done
136:23 - with the bottom tabs
136:24 - i think we are all right bottom tabs
136:26 - should be good to go uh we are finished
136:29 - with this now we can actually move on to
136:33 - doing bigger and better things in our
136:34 - lives
136:35 - anytime you have unused imports you can
136:37 - just delete them
136:39 - that's what i like to do
136:40 - just so
136:42 - my code looks cleaner it doesn't look as
136:44 - intimidating plus it just improves the
136:46 - performance of your code because
136:48 - you deleted what you don't need
136:55 - all right now we're going to work on the
136:57 - new post screen that means that you
136:59 - should be able to go there and upload a
137:01 - post things like that okay so what does
137:03 - that look like that's going to look like
137:06 - that's going to be this screen right
137:08 - here
137:10 - all right so what we want to be able to
137:11 - do is we want to be able to go into the
137:13 - screen upload a post
137:15 - and it should show us this post
137:19 - okay
137:21 - so this screen
137:23 - is going to have a
137:25 - this screen is going to have a post
137:26 - uploader component so we're done with
137:28 - bottom tabs
137:30 - so that
137:31 - uploader that you guys see right there
137:34 - that is we're using formic and yup for
137:36 - that and what that allows you to do is
137:38 - validate so when you type in stuff it
137:40 - validates if what you wrote is correct
137:42 - or not and it won't let you push things
137:45 - from the front end
137:46 - that um it'll provide you with front end
137:49 - validation which is super important
137:52 - because then your back end won't get
137:54 - clogged up and you won't have to use
137:56 - your back end to validate for the user
137:58 - because that will provide a much slower
138:01 - and worse user experience
138:05 - all right so i'm gonna
138:07 - open up the actual component that you'll
138:09 - be you will be making
138:11 - so the first thing we'll be making
138:13 - actually on that screen if i go back to
138:15 - that
138:16 - oops not what i meant to do
138:21 - so the first thing we're going to need
138:22 - to do is make that top uh make the part
138:25 - at the top that says new post with the
138:27 - back arrow
138:29 - okay so let's go ahead and do that and
138:31 - we're gonna start working on a new
138:32 - screen as well
138:35 - okay so this is the thing that we're
138:36 - building so let's go ahead and make a
138:38 - new screen so let's go into new screens
138:41 - create new file
138:42 - and we'll call it
138:44 - new post screen
138:47 - dot js
138:50 - and this will
138:52 - do this we'll give it a safe area view
138:59 - um and it will take in the add new post
139:01 - component
139:03 - and we'll give it a style and we'll make
139:05 - it background color black
139:08 - and then we'll do that same hack that we
139:10 - do which is we give it a flex one so it
139:11 - will take over the whole screen and make
139:13 - it black
139:17 - okay we don't need this this yet
139:21 - let's go inside of components we'll
139:23 - create a new folder
139:26 - called new posts
139:31 - new folder it'll be called new
139:37 - new post just like that and that will
139:40 - have all the components
139:42 - so in here we're gonna say
139:44 - add new post.js
139:47 - and add new post
139:49 - dot js will be pretty simple
139:54 - and it will be a text that just says add
139:56 - new post for now
139:59 - we'll give it a style of color white so
140:02 - we can just see it
140:10 - and we're now gonna add it to app.js so
140:12 - we can see it at the app level okay but
140:15 - right before we leave this screen let's
140:17 - just see all the work that we've done so
140:19 - far
140:20 - because it is quite a lot and it is
140:22 - quite impressive what we've done so take
140:24 - a look at this this is what we've done
140:27 - so far
140:29 - we've built this screen right here
140:31 - it's able to take in posts and comments
140:33 - and show them it's able to show you view
140:35 - all comments
140:37 - uh as well
140:38 - and
140:40 - everything is clickable right so i can
140:42 - click it
140:44 - we have our stories component which
140:46 - you can move horizontally like this
140:49 - we have our post
140:51 - component that shows all of this we've
140:53 - built our post header we built our post
140:55 - footer comment section i mean there's a
140:57 - ton
140:58 - that we've already done you guys and
141:00 - then the bottom tabs they look super
141:02 - nice right when you click them they
141:03 - become active or inactive
141:05 - based on what you clicked and when you
141:07 - clicked it
141:10 - so great job so far if you're following
141:13 - along or you're just even watching this
141:14 - like you're gonna be picking up a lot of
141:16 - these skills
141:19 - so in our app.js
141:21 - we wanna now render out this component
141:23 - so i'm gonna remove home screen and i'm
141:25 - just going to say new post screen
141:29 - all right
141:30 - and now
141:33 - new post screen is complaining so let's
141:36 - import
141:37 - add new posts there you go so this is
141:42 - this is pretty good this will just get
141:44 - us started with what we need so we're
141:46 - done with this guys and now we're gonna
141:47 - actually start working on adding
141:49 - that header part right here which will
141:52 - go right up there
141:54 - all right so it's going to be like a
141:57 - back arrow and then it's going to say
141:59 - new posts in the middle so let's work on
142:01 - this now
142:07 - so we're gonna now go inside of our ad
142:09 - post component
142:15 - all right and uh
142:17 - this is gonna be fairly straightforward
142:19 - guys so let's go ahead and make some of
142:21 - our stylings we're going to need so i'm
142:22 - going to say const
142:24 - styles
142:27 - stylesheet.container
142:32 - oh i i don't mean to say that i meant to
142:34 - say not create
142:37 - okay and in here we're going to have
142:39 - container
142:41 - this will have a margin horizontal
142:47 - of 10
142:48 - we will import our style sheet so let's
142:50 - go import it
142:53 - we'll do header container this will
142:55 - contain the header
143:00 - it's like no kazi what else will it
143:02 - contain
143:05 - all right there we go
143:07 - put a comma right there otherwise it'll
143:09 - keep complaining at you we'll do justify
143:12 - content we'll give it space between
143:14 - and then we'll go align item center
143:17 - and the next one we'll need is header
143:19 - text
143:20 - i'll leave this empty for now and we'll
143:22 - style it in just a second now i want to
143:23 - start seeing things
143:27 - so let's start off
143:31 - uh
143:32 - in our view we're gonna need an image
143:36 - that's gonna be the back button by the
143:37 - way
143:40 - okay
143:41 - and so we'll import i'll get that back
143:43 - button right now and you can use this uh
143:46 - url here
143:49 - uh david and amanda can you guys please
143:52 - get all the assets and all the urls in
143:54 - just one folder and make it so everybody
143:56 - can click the link in the description or
143:57 - something
144:00 - because some of them are assets and some
144:02 - of a lot of them are actually just urls
144:05 - so
144:06 - every people will need access to the
144:08 - urls
144:11 - all right we're gonna do source uri and
144:15 - we're gonna drop this guy
144:18 - beautiful
144:19 - and of course now we need to give it a
144:21 - certain width and a height so let's go
144:23 - here and let's go style
144:27 - with 30 height
144:29 - 30.
144:30 - there we go so now our left arrow is
144:32 - showing up
144:34 - we do want to make it a button so let's
144:36 - make it touchable rapid and touchable
144:38 - opacity
144:50 - okay
145:00 - [Music]
145:01 - all right so we got the touchable
145:03 - opacity action going on now when i click
145:05 - it it actually detects it i don't need
145:07 - this text to be inside of the touchable
145:09 - opacity this text can be outside of it
145:12 - this does need to be like a flex
145:14 - direction row type of situation so we're
145:16 - gonna do
145:17 - is we're gonna just use our header
145:19 - container that we made so i'm gonna say
145:22 - styles
145:23 - dot header container
145:36 - um and in add new post
145:40 - uh here's what i'm gonna do instead so
145:43 - i'm gonna make this entire thing its own
145:46 - component so i'm gonna just say
145:48 - const
145:50 - header
145:55 - and just paste that in there
145:57 - and then inside of here
146:02 - we're just going to render that
146:03 - component so i'm going to say view
146:08 - and we'll say header
146:11 - just like that so now it's showing up
146:14 - now this view will inherit the style of
146:18 - the container so we're going to says
146:20 - styles container
146:22 - there we go
146:24 - this is margin horizontal so it just
146:27 - brings that thing in
146:31 - and the next thing we're going to need
146:33 - is post form so i'll just leave that
146:35 - written here just so we remember that
146:41 - okay
146:42 - and this will just simply say new post
146:45 - okay and now we're going to style our
146:50 - header text
146:52 - and we'll say
146:54 - color
146:59 - say color and make it white we will make
147:02 - the font weight
147:04 - 700 will make the font size of 20 and
147:08 - margin left
147:10 - 27.5
147:14 - okay and we'll give that to the
147:19 - uh new post so we'll just go and we'll
147:22 - go
147:22 - styles
147:25 - dot header
147:27 - text
147:29 - okay so now it looks nice and bold
147:37 - great
147:48 - okay cool so we're gonna fix that in
147:51 - just a second let me actually just take
147:53 - a look here
148:05 - so what i'm going to do is i'm just
148:06 - going to give it instead of a margin
148:07 - left we're just going to give it a
148:09 - margin right of
148:15 - five
148:19 - okay so
148:38 - so that looks good to me this is looking
148:40 - good
148:42 - font weights margin right
148:45 - looks good
148:54 - i'm wrapping the header in header
148:56 - container so that's good
149:00 - [Music]
149:08 - okay
149:09 - so
149:23 - so that's another hack you can do by the
149:25 - way to center it okay you can just
149:27 - because it's space between
149:32 - i can actually just add like an empty
149:34 - text component there and
149:37 - this will actually help me center it
149:39 - okay so just remember that i'm going to
149:41 - emphasize that this is just an empty
149:43 - text component with nothing inside of it
149:45 - and all i'm using it for is so my new
149:48 - post can actually just get centered
149:49 - that's all okay
149:51 - there of course better ways of doing it
149:53 - but
149:54 - it's uh but we're just going to make it
149:56 - work for now
149:58 - cool
149:59 - so it looks good to me now we got to
150:01 - start working on our post form
150:08 - beautiful
150:09 - so this is actually gonna be a heavy one
150:13 - alright so buckle up because we're gonna
150:15 - be doing a couple of things here
150:19 - so we're going to call this
150:21 - formic
150:22 - post uploader
150:24 - all right and we're going to make a new
150:25 - component inside of new post
150:39 - okay cool all the urls are there awesome
150:41 - thank you for sharing that with me
150:46 - so this is going to be called formic
150:48 - post uploader dot js just like this
150:51 - all right and uh we're gonna make our
150:53 - forms uh
150:55 - we're gonna make our form inside of that
150:58 - okay so it's gonna be a couple of things
151:00 - we're gonna do number one
151:02 - first let's just see if our formic post
151:05 - uploader is showing up
151:06 - so we'll give it a style
151:08 - color
151:10 - of white
151:12 - and um i'm just going to say formic
151:19 - and let's go like this
151:24 - i just imported at the top right there
151:26 - and our formic post uploader formic
151:29 - component is showing up and now we need
151:31 - to actually start writing code in here
151:34 - so we need to do a couple of things
151:36 - we need to install yup
151:38 - and we need to actually install formic
151:41 - so let's go ahead and do that i'm going
151:42 - to do yarn
151:44 - add
151:44 - i'm going to zoom in here so you all can
151:46 - see what i'm writing
151:49 - uh
151:50 - yarn add
151:52 - formic
151:54 - this will install that and then the next
151:56 - thing that we need to install is
151:58 - yup so we're gonna do yarn add
152:01 - yup
152:02 - so these are the two installs that we
152:04 - need
152:05 - now we can zoom out
152:10 - all right and now we're gonna do
152:14 - upload post schema
152:17 - and this is to give it a schema of like
152:19 - what's allowed and what isn't allowed
152:21 - okay we're gonna say image url
152:24 - and it's going to be a yup string
152:27 - and we're going to make sure
152:29 - to say hey make sure it's a url
152:32 - and then we're going to make it required
152:36 - url is required okay that's what it's
152:38 - gonna say and then caption we're gonna
152:41 - say
152:42 - yup dot string
152:48 - dot max and we're gonna max the caption
152:50 - out at 2200 and then i'm just gonna say
152:52 - caption
152:53 - has reached
152:55 - the character
152:58 - limit
153:00 - and that's how it is on instagram you
153:02 - can only you can write up to 200 200
153:05 - characters so that's what will allow you
153:07 - to do that make sure to put the comma
153:08 - because it's an object you're giving it
153:10 - with two properties one image url and
153:12 - one caption two keys now it's saying hey
153:15 - i don't know what this yup thing is so
153:16 - let's see if we can import it
153:23 - uh okay we can't import it so we're just
153:26 - gonna type it out we're gonna say import
153:27 - everything as yup
153:30 - from
153:30 - yup
153:32 - all right and then we'll also say import
153:35 - formic
153:36 - from
153:38 - formic
153:41 - all right when it's complaining like
153:42 - that all you got to do is just refresh
153:44 - and it should be much better
153:46 - now it's freaking out why i changed this
153:49 - so we're just gonna go ahead and say yup
154:03 - uh corey says is this a recording this
154:06 - is not a recording i am live right now
154:09 - what is up welcome
154:12 - i feel like we gotta make these lower
154:14 - quality so feels like we're live
154:20 - all right so we got our post schema now
154:22 - we can actually start working on our
154:24 - form
154:25 - um
154:26 - this is where things get just a little
154:28 - bit tricky
154:30 - so hang in there with me and we're gonna
154:32 - go through it
154:39 - alright so now let's go inside of our
154:42 - formic post uploader
154:44 - and we're gonna do
154:47 - the following
154:49 - okay so we're gonna say
154:51 - thumbnail url set thumbnail url
154:57 - and we're going to say use state
155:00 - imported from react by the way if you
155:02 - haven't already
155:03 - and we'll start it off with the use
155:05 - state so this is going to be a
155:06 - placeholder image you guys that we're
155:07 - going to be using
155:10 - when it doesn't have an image yet so
155:12 - it's just a placeholder image okay
155:14 - as a matter of fact let's just actually
155:16 - do that let's call it placeholder
155:19 - image
155:20 - and we'll give it that image and we'll
155:22 - replace this with
155:25 - placeholder image just like that okay
155:32 - all right
155:33 - and now comes the really
155:36 - tricky formic part okay so
155:39 - here we go so this return i'm gonna make
155:41 - my format component
155:44 - and here's how formic works
155:46 - formic
155:48 - is
155:50 - so within the formic this is where our
155:52 - form is gonna go our form and when i
155:54 - meet my form right you're like what form
155:56 - what are we building as a form that's
155:58 - where you're gonna put in your caption
156:00 - and you're gonna put it in your url that
156:02 - essentially doesn't look like a form you
156:04 - never think of it as a form but it's
156:06 - actually a form right
156:08 - so
156:09 - we need to treat it like a form because
156:11 - we need both of those things to go
156:15 - at the same time we also need both of it
156:17 - to have a validation and we need to be
156:19 - understood like a form there are like
156:20 - two things at once right
156:23 - so inside of formic you put your form so
156:25 - this is where our form is gonna go and
156:28 - our form is going to be made up of like
156:30 - two text
156:31 - input fields right which is
156:34 - where you can actually write your text a
156:36 - caption or for the url
156:39 - so that's just keep that in mind
156:41 - um the
156:42 - the syntax is going to be really heavy
156:44 - and the syntax of this is going to make
156:45 - you feel like you're confused or you
156:47 - don't know what's going on but the idea
156:49 - is what i just stated
156:52 - alright so initial values are caption
156:56 - and image url
156:58 - which are going to be empty in the start
157:05 - then we have on submit what should
157:07 - happen and on submit
157:09 - what we want to happen is we needed to
157:11 - get the values and we just needed to
157:13 - print out the values that's it
157:17 - and validation schema that we're going
157:19 - to give it is going to be the validation
157:20 - schema that we just made right there
157:22 - which just says make sure that the image
157:24 - and the caption fields are filled out
157:27 - okay
157:29 - now
157:30 - is the part where we build out our form
157:32 - and so we're gonna have
157:35 - an anonymous function kind of just like
157:39 - i mean this is crazy but uh copilot is
157:42 - like filling it all out which is insane
157:45 - but i'm just going to build it out with
157:46 - you guys so we're going to go like this
157:51 - so we're going to go handle
157:53 - handle
157:54 - blur
157:56 - handle change
157:59 - we're going to give it handle submit
158:03 - it's going to i mean it's going to take
158:04 - handle submit
158:06 - of values
158:08 - errors and is valid
158:11 - all right so
158:12 - you're probably like what the hell's
158:13 - going on here
158:15 - all of this guys is being pulled
158:20 - from
158:22 - formic itself
158:24 - okay so that's what's going on there
158:29 - so this is a function
158:33 - and then we're going to render that
158:34 - function's output
158:35 - right there
158:40 - there we go
158:42 - says expression expected and i'll just
158:44 - put in false
158:46 - so
158:48 - this whole thing
158:50 - is a function and it's destructuring a
158:53 - bunch of values that we're going to need
158:55 - and then we're just returning them right
158:57 - away
158:59 - and here we go now we're just going to
159:00 - build this thing out so we're going to
159:03 - put jsx fragments and then inside of it
159:05 - we're going to start putting our stuff
159:06 - so we're going to go view
159:09 - inside of this view we're going to have
159:11 - our image
159:16 - this is going to be the image that like
159:19 - holds that dummy uh dummy image
159:29 - and then we're gonna have our text input
159:31 - field
159:36 - okay make sure you import it
159:40 - can't find variable formic so
159:44 - import
159:46 - uh i believe it's imported with a
159:48 - capital f here
159:52 - there we go now it's not complaining
159:53 - anymore
159:55 - so text input we're going to give it a
159:57 - placeholder
160:00 - of just like hello
160:02 - well that was weird my app just crashed
160:06 - let's go back into expo go
160:09 - and it doesn't matter whichever one of
160:11 - these i open i'll open this one
160:15 - okay
160:17 - and of course we also want to make sure
160:19 - that our text
160:21 - color is gray so we can actually see it
160:26 - so i'll say placeholder color gray so
160:27 - now
160:28 - my thing is showing up right you can see
160:31 - it's not looking pretty
160:33 - but it's it's showing up there so that's
160:36 - good
160:40 - so we're gonna need like multiple text
160:43 - inputs okay so this is text input number
160:45 - one
160:46 - for the captions and then we're gonna
160:48 - need another one for the url
160:51 - okay so basically
160:53 - this one is gonna say write
160:56 - a caption
160:58 - and this one is gonna say
161:00 - enter
161:02 - image url
161:04 - okay so there we go
161:06 - both of them are there
161:07 - and then on top of this so we have an
161:09 - image
161:12 - um and then we're gonna have
161:16 - so let's go here and let's update the
161:18 - component
161:19 - because we're not just on headers
161:20 - anymore you're going to be building this
161:21 - thing right so
161:22 - that's what it looks like so if you t if
161:25 - you pay attention to this
161:28 - you can see on the top left you have an
161:29 - image then you have write a caption and
161:31 - then underneath it you have enter image
161:32 - url
161:38 - so let's go add all of that stuff in now
161:56 - okay so for image i'm just going to kind
161:57 - of uh
161:59 - hard code the image uri here so we're
162:01 - going to say source
162:02 - uri and we're going to just say
162:04 - placeholder image
162:07 - okay and now of course we need to give
162:09 - it certain styling so it actually shows
162:11 - up
162:13 - this whole thing actually should be
162:15 - wrapped up in a view i believe
162:21 - yeah so we're gonna remove that view
162:23 - from there and we'll move that view down
162:26 - here
162:32 - so this image now we needed to show
162:35 - which means that we need to give it its
162:36 - size that's why it's not showing
162:38 - currently so we're going to give it a
162:40 - size of a width of 100 so we're going to
162:42 - go style
162:46 - style
162:47 - width of 100
162:49 - and then we're going to give it a height
162:51 - of 100 like this so now that image is
162:53 - showing up
163:00 - okay
163:01 - now let's start working on these text
163:03 - inputs that we have
163:07 - okay
163:10 - great so
163:14 - so let's work on the write a captcha one
163:17 - so this one is gonna be multi-line is
163:19 - gonna be true on this
163:21 - all right so now it will allow us to
163:23 - write multi lines like you see how i'm
163:25 - hitting enter and it's taking me to the
163:26 - new line
163:30 - okay
163:31 - now we need to give it a color
163:33 - so we can actually see
163:35 - what we're writing so i'm going to just
163:37 - go ahead here and say style
163:39 - color
163:40 - white
163:41 - so now when i type it should actually
163:43 - show me what i'm writing
163:45 - we'll give that same color
163:47 - down here to this guy as well
163:49 - there we go
163:54 - cool
163:56 - for the caption though we're going to
163:57 - also have a font size
164:00 - so we're not just going to have a
164:02 - amber also gonna have font size for this
164:04 - let's go font size and let's give it a
164:07 - 20.
164:10 - cool
164:11 - i mean it looks pretty similar so i
164:13 - don't
164:14 - oh yeah yeah so there we go now write a
164:16 - caption looks much bigger which is fine
164:20 - now what we want to do is on change text
164:25 - handle change and give it caption so
164:28 - what's nice about formic is you don't
164:29 - have to pass all these states like you
164:31 - don't have to do like
164:32 - this date and set state and then do this
164:35 - and make a state for every single thing
164:36 - formic will handle that for you
164:39 - everything is built in
164:42 - on blur we're gonna say handle blur and
164:45 - give it the caption
164:47 - for value we'll give it the value that
164:50 - it's getting from the captions
164:52 - and
164:53 - that should be good enough
164:57 - okay
164:58 - now we're to work on the other text
165:00 - input
165:03 - and the other text input is going to
165:04 - take in a couple of things as well so
165:05 - we're going to do on change text
165:09 - right there
165:10 - copilot is very smart
165:14 - on blur
165:15 - do the same thing
165:17 - beautiful
165:21 - values do the same thing
165:24 - and then
165:27 - the only thing that's left is
165:30 - yeah i think that's pretty good font
165:32 - size should be a little bit smaller so
165:34 - i'm going to grab the styling from there
165:36 - we'll overwrite this and we'll just say
165:39 - 18. so it's a tiny bit smaller
165:44 - dope
165:46 - okay now the only things that look
165:48 - different is how the views are styled so
165:51 - let's go ahead and
165:53 - we're going to style our views now
165:58 - style
165:59 - and i'll say margin 20
166:02 - boom that's already making it look
166:03 - better
166:04 - we're going to say justify content space
166:07 - between
166:09 - okay and we're gonna go flex
166:11 - uh
166:12 - flex
166:14 - direction row
166:16 - nice
166:19 - so enter image url is the one that's
166:22 - looking funnier
166:24 - so let's see if we can move it out of
166:26 - this view and if it does what we want it
166:28 - to do
166:30 - it does
166:33 - okay
166:34 - but let's just move it back for now and
166:36 - i just want to make sure that we're
166:37 - doing everything accurately
166:50 - okay
166:58 - yes so we are going to move it out of
167:00 - this view actually so let's move it out
167:01 - of this view let's put it right there
167:04 - okay
167:05 - let's also put a like a divider here so
167:07 - it's very clear that they're like two
167:09 - separate things right
167:12 - now the divider let's give it a width
167:15 - of 0.2
167:18 - and then orientation is going to be
167:19 - vertical
167:21 - it's like a very thin divider that we
167:23 - want to add there
167:27 - uh
167:30 - okay
167:32 - now write a caption is looking a little
167:35 - bit funny
167:36 - so let's put a view on it
167:43 - and we'll put a closing view
167:46 - down here
167:50 - just like that
167:52 - and for this i'm going to say style and
167:55 - we'll go flex one
167:59 - beautiful
168:00 - and then we'll go margin
168:02 - left on this
168:04 - there we go so now write a caption is
168:06 - looking
168:08 - good
168:17 - yeah pretty much all of it is looking
168:19 - good now we just need to go underneath
168:22 - text input
168:24 - and uh
168:27 - just need to do a couple of things so we
168:29 - need to now write error so i'm going to
168:31 - say errors dot image url
168:34 - and then we're going to say
168:42 - font size will make it 10 and give it a
168:44 - color of red so this will show us the
168:46 - errors and i'm just showing you this so
168:48 - you can see how formic works with errors
168:51 - so we're going to errors
168:52 - image url
168:54 - so you can see now it's already
168:56 - complaining about the error
169:02 - right image url must be a valid url just
169:05 - like that right so when you don't write
169:06 - it it goes
169:07 - a url is required perfect
169:13 - all right and then what we want to do
169:17 - is you want to give it a button
169:21 - and that button
169:24 - on press should handle submit
169:28 - it should take in the title and it
169:30 - should be called share and then disabled
169:33 - should be
169:34 - is valid so thanks to formic we get is
169:38 - valid from formic itself and it knows
169:40 - whether the form you're submitting is
169:42 - valid or not you and i don't have to do
169:44 - anything about that
169:47 - let's import button from react native
169:50 - there we go and now our share button is
169:52 - showing up now notice that when i reload
169:55 - this page it actually starts off blue
169:58 - but then when i start writing it becomes
170:00 - disabled
170:01 - so that to me looks weird what's this
170:04 - complaining about font size so i wrote
170:06 - font size
170:08 - incorrectly here
170:11 - so like that's weird right like why
170:14 - now it's grayed out but when i refresh
170:17 - it starts off as an enabled state so
170:20 - this is a little bug that formic has and
170:22 - they have no good way of solving this so
170:23 - like
170:24 - the thing that i found that you have to
170:26 - do
170:27 - is uh
170:28 - pass in validation validate
170:31 - on mount and give it true
170:36 - so like this will actually validate this
170:38 - as soon as this component is mounted so
170:40 - like now let's refresh and see it's
170:41 - disabled i can't even click share until
170:44 - i type in it's not working and now when
170:46 - i type in it's not working but if i give
170:48 - it an actual link
170:52 - hello.com
170:53 - boom now it actually allows me to hit
170:55 - the share button and when i hit it look
170:57 - at the bottom left
171:02 - so look at the bottom left every time i
171:04 - hit this look at the console log
171:07 - it's getting the data for me right so if
171:09 - i change this to hello
171:12 - new post
171:14 - boom look at that
171:16 - so we're getting
171:19 - um all the data that we actually need
171:21 - right that's
171:23 - i guess that's a good thing about uh
171:25 - just having that this is a nice little
171:28 - trick you can do and everything then
171:29 - works
171:31 - okay great
171:32 - now our validation is working as
171:35 - expected
171:37 - so
171:38 - we're pretty good now all we need to do
171:40 - is be able to render the image right so
171:42 - for example
171:43 - let's say i get an image
171:49 - okay let's use this image here
171:52 - and we wanted to be able to render that
171:54 - image right there before you hit post so
171:56 - we're just gonna need a couple of things
171:58 - for that
172:00 - we already got this
172:03 - right so this thumbnail url is going to
172:04 - be the one that we need
172:08 - so
172:09 - let's go to our image url text input and
172:14 - as you're typing in here what we're
172:15 - going to say is on change
172:18 - [Music]
172:20 - we're going to get access to the
172:24 - event
172:26 - and we're just going to say set
172:27 - thumbnail
172:29 - url
172:30 - to the
172:32 - nativeevent.txt so whatever text we're
172:34 - getting from there
172:38 - okay
172:38 - and now we have access to that thumbnail
172:41 - changing and now we just need to make it
172:42 - dynamic so we're going to go to our
172:44 - image right here and this part right
172:46 - here we're going to make it dynamic and
172:48 - we're going to say
172:51 - thumbnail url if it is if it exists
172:56 - then give me thumbnail url otherwise
172:59 - give me the placeholder image
173:01 - okay that's it and now it should be good
173:03 - so let's paste in
173:07 - and there you go it actually renders it
173:09 - in real time let's remove this and now
173:11 - it's not there anymore let's type stuff
173:13 - and it goes invisible
173:14 - so
173:17 - that's exactly
173:19 - what we want
173:24 - beautiful
173:25 - okay so it looks like this is um working
173:28 - how we expect
173:39 - there we go
173:44 - awesome so this is looking like
173:46 - it does everything we needed to do when
173:48 - i hit share it's giving me just hit 5200
173:50 - subscribe subscribers i'm getting the
173:53 - image url
173:55 - so
173:56 - in terms of being able to post the image
173:59 - we are good
174:01 - now we're going to connect the database
174:02 - part to it later for now what we need to
174:05 - do is we do need to create our signed in
174:08 - stack and signed out stack which means
174:10 - that we're going to need to start adding
174:11 - in navigations now
174:13 - because if i hit this back button i
174:16 - unfortunately can't navigate to the home
174:17 - screen so we want to be able to navigate
174:20 - back and forth so
174:22 - let's
174:23 - uh work on that now guys
174:43 - okay
174:54 - so formic post uploader is successful
174:57 - all right i don't think that there's
174:59 - anything else we have to do here
175:00 - we're good we did the whole thing
175:04 - good job for hanging in there because
175:05 - that one is a little complicated but
175:08 - when you get it right it's so good like
175:09 - for example if i make this link invalid
175:12 - boom it even crashes how nice
175:15 - right no suitable url request handler
175:18 - found for htt
175:20 - so it just like broke right and now
175:22 - let's go back and now it can handle it
175:24 - and we can actually just hit share so
175:26 - very very good exactly what we want it
175:28 - to do
175:29 - so let's go
175:32 - to the next part now and start adding in
175:34 - navigation so navigation guys is going
175:36 - to take in
175:37 - um
175:39 - a little bit of
175:40 - moving around but it's okay
175:43 - i believe in you you can do this
175:46 - so let's create a new screen and we will
175:48 - call it
175:50 - navigation.js
175:54 - all right and in here
175:58 - first of all we need to install a couple
176:00 - of things
176:02 - so here's what you want to install now
176:07 - remove this off the screen
176:13 - all right so here we go
176:16 - we're gonna do yarn add
176:19 - and we're gonna go react navigation
176:25 - native
176:28 - so that's the first install you wanna
176:29 - make the next install is you wanna
176:32 - install the stack so we're gonna go
176:34 - pretty much the same thing except slash
176:36 - native we're gonna say slash
176:38 - stack
176:41 - we also will need access to gesture
176:44 - handlers which means when you swipe left
176:45 - then swipe right
176:48 - so we're going to do yarn add
176:50 - react
176:52 - native
176:53 - gesture handler
176:55 - and you can also use npm i like yarn
176:58 - more because yarn is better it will
176:59 - resolve all the dependencies for you
177:05 - dope we'll also get valid url
177:08 - we might want to use it
177:10 - at some points but i think let's just
177:12 - get it for now
177:17 - if we end up not if we end up deciding
177:18 - not to use it we just won't use it so
177:20 - it's fine now inside of our navigation
177:22 - we can actually start working on this so
177:24 - let's just go ahead do our usual rnfe
177:28 - cool
177:29 - so the cons that we're actually going to
177:31 - be exporting from here we're going to
177:34 - call it
177:37 - oh
177:40 - wow
177:41 - thank you guys thank you guys
177:43 - yeah sometimes i forget to zoom out guys
177:45 - i apologize so
177:46 - i didn't do much
177:48 - all i did is literally rneffy
177:51 - boom that's it
177:54 - okay cool
177:55 - so now
177:57 - inside of here
178:00 - well i'm just going to call this the
178:02 - signed in signed
178:05 - in stack
178:12 - okay and then we're gonna have
178:13 - navigation
178:14 - container
178:18 - and this entire thing is going to be
178:20 - inside of the navigation container we
178:22 - don't need this return so because we can
178:24 - just do an implicit return like this
178:28 - wrap that in navigation container
178:31 - and then we're gonna do this
178:34 - we're gonna go stack.navigator
178:38 - stack
178:41 - dot navigator
178:48 - we don't need the stack actions
178:51 - so let's import that though let's go
178:53 - import
178:55 - create stack
178:58 - navigator from react native stack that's
179:01 - perfect and we're gonna also do import
179:04 - navigation
179:06 - container
179:09 - from
179:11 - react
179:14 - slash native just like that
179:18 - okay
179:19 - now let's go ahead and make our stack so
179:21 - we're gonna go right here we're gonna go
179:23 - cons stack
179:28 - we're going to set our screen options
179:32 - to basically say that don't show the
179:35 - header
179:48 - okay and now
179:51 - inside of here
179:53 - we're gonna do uh initial route so we're
179:55 - gonna set our all of our screens now so
179:57 - we're gonna do stack.screen kind of like
180:00 - this
180:02 - you don't need to pass the options here
180:05 - okay
180:08 - and for each of these screens we're
180:10 - going to give it a name so here i'm
180:11 - going to call this home screen
180:14 - and then here i'm also going to import
180:16 - my home screen from right here so i'm
180:19 - getting my screen from my screens folder
180:22 - okay
180:23 - let's go ahead and get our
180:25 - new post screen
180:32 - just like this so i got my new post
180:33 - screen now so i got both of those
180:35 - screens
180:39 - now i need to just give it a initial
180:41 - route so we're going to do initial
180:45 - route name and we'll go home screen
180:48 - and then we'll go screen
180:51 - options
180:55 - screen options
180:58 - just like that
181:02 - so these options that i created here i'm
181:04 - just passing that header is
181:06 - false
181:08 - here are my screens
181:10 - so
181:12 - don't need this
181:14 - remove that
181:17 - all right so here's my signed in stack
181:19 - now we actually need to be able to use
181:21 - the signed in stack so in our app dot js
181:25 - instead of new post screen we're
181:26 - actually going to pass in the signed
181:30 - in
181:31 - stack
181:33 - like this
181:34 - so let's go here and let's export
181:36 - default signed
181:39 - in stack
181:40 - let's go back
181:43 - let's now import it so now we got the
181:45 - signed in stack we don't need to give
181:47 - scr we don't need to give app specific
181:49 - screens anymore we can give it an entire
181:51 - stack and notice that it's already
181:53 - rendering it correctly
181:55 - okay that's perfect that's exactly what
181:57 - we want this means it's working
182:01 - another way i can find out it's working
182:02 - is i can change the initial route to new
182:05 - post screen and it should render the new
182:06 - post screen when i refresh
182:09 - uh you can see it does
182:11 - go back refresh it now shows the home
182:14 - screen
182:15 - so this is doing exactly what we wanted
182:16 - to do now all we need to do is when i
182:19 - hit the plus sign it should be able to
182:21 - take me to the new post screen so here's
182:23 - how we're going to do that
182:26 - let's go to
182:28 - our
182:30 - home screen
182:31 - our home screen is going to get access
182:33 - to
182:34 - navigation
182:37 - our
182:38 - header component
182:40 - is also going to get access to
182:42 - navigation
182:45 - let's command click into header
182:48 - it's going to destructure the navigation
182:50 - that we just passed it
182:54 - and
182:55 - when you click the plus sign which is
182:57 - right over here
183:00 - we're gonna go on press
183:03 - what we wanted to do is we wanted to do
183:05 - the following navigation
183:07 - dot push
183:09 - take me to the
183:11 - new post screen
183:14 - that's it
183:18 - and now inside of the
183:21 - new post screen so the
183:24 - for make post uploader or not sorry
183:28 - the new post screen oh sorry inside the
183:30 - add new post component
183:33 - that back arrow
183:35 - all we're gonna do is say on press
183:42 - navigation dot oops now what i meant
183:46 - navigation dot
183:48 - go back
183:49 - this will allow us to just go back and
183:51 - forth between the first two screens so
183:54 - formic post uploader is fine but what
183:56 - did i i thought i imported something
183:57 - that we don't need that's fine
184:02 - okay
184:03 - now header actually needs access to the
184:05 - navigation so we're gonna go navigation
184:07 - equals navigation
184:09 - add new post component
184:11 - we'll destructure navigation for this
184:14 - but here's where navigation is actually
184:15 - coming from let's go to the new post
184:16 - screen new post screen is the one that
184:19 - actually has access to it only screens
184:21 - have access to navigations then you pass
184:23 - it to the children of those screens so
184:26 - this new post component is a child
184:28 - navigation
184:30 - close this
184:32 - and
184:33 - i think it should be good to go
184:34 - literally in the first try
184:36 - but let's see
184:37 - hit plus
184:38 - navigates me it back
184:41 - it breaks
184:42 - so why does it break let's go to add new
184:44 - post we're getting access to navigation
184:47 - we're passing it we're not destructuring
184:49 - it inside of our header component so
184:50 - let's just go and destructure it now it
184:53 - will work there
184:54 - boom look at that
184:56 - that is slick right
185:00 - boom
185:02 - right so you can navigate by sliding to
185:05 - the left so you can navigate two ways so
185:08 - you can navigate
185:10 - a back by sliding left like this look at
185:12 - how buttery smooth that is so nice and
185:16 - you could also go back by hitting the
185:17 - back button
185:19 - isn't that nice guys
185:27 - wow
185:32 - reading the chats just to engage with
185:33 - you guys actually
185:35 - i'll put the chat right here actually
185:37 - because honestly it's even it's a little
185:39 - distracting but it's kind of like fun
185:41 - for me to be engaging with you guys the
185:43 - whole time
185:51 - all right
185:54 - okay cool
186:06 - navigate here navigate back
186:10 - cool so navigation is working like
186:12 - expected
186:14 - i just want to double check a few things
186:16 - here
186:22 - on submit we also want to be able to go
186:24 - back so when i actually hit share
186:26 - i want able to go back uh eng happy says
186:29 - no back-end for this build absolutely
186:31 - not true bro uh if you looked at the
186:33 - start you cannot do any of the things
186:35 - that we do without a back-end for
186:36 - example having
186:38 - sign-ins user registrations user
186:40 - authentication this app will have
186:42 - um
186:44 - being able to create a new account
186:47 - you cannot access and go in without
186:49 - logging in actually so all of that is
186:51 - gonna need a backend and then being able
186:53 - to make a post all those posts will be
186:54 - retrieved by a back end will be written
186:57 - to a back end
187:00 - you will also not be able to see posts
187:02 - if you're not logged in so like there's
187:04 - maximum security on this thing
187:12 - cool
187:13 - james says smooth yes sir looks great
187:19 - all right so now we need to just add
187:21 - that there
187:23 - beautiful first clone i wanted to try
187:25 - we'll try it after live south african
187:27 - network was so bad

187:45 - we're gonna add on submit
187:48 - and
187:49 - right here here's what we're gonna do
187:56 - okay we'll say console.log
188:00 - your post was submitted
188:04 - successfully
188:06 - uh we'll add a little tada successful
188:09 - and then we will do navigation dot oh i
188:12 - never mean to do that navigation
188:16 - dot go back
188:19 - okay here we go so let's go back
188:22 - let's go forward
188:23 - um oh this will also need access to
188:25 - navigation so let's destructure it right
188:28 - here
188:29 - navigation
188:31 - and formic post uploader is on the
188:34 - ad inside of the add new post component
188:37 - so let's give it access right here as
188:40 - well
188:42 - and then let's go to the formic post
188:43 - uploader
188:44 - uh
188:48 - yeah now it should have access to it
188:51 - okay great so let's actually make a post
188:55 - let's uh get that image
188:58 - gee
189:00 - this woohoo hit 250k
189:04 - let's hit share
189:06 - and there we go we can see woohoo hit
189:08 - 250k and we can see the image url your
189:10 - post was submitted successfully and it
189:12 - rerouted me back to this page so how
189:15 - freaking nice
189:17 - yo that is amazing emmett says oh my god
189:20 - i have recently received an interview
189:22 - from a company thanks to the ubereats
189:24 - clone thanks quasi
189:26 - yo
189:28 - that is amazing i'm so happy for you so
189:32 - freaking happy for you thank you for
189:33 - letting me know that i appreciate it yo
189:35 - that is amazing
189:38 - it's real world stuff guys penelope says
189:41 - this is so cool i'm happy
189:44 - yes yes yes
189:46 - awesome
189:49 - so boom boom and now i can go back right
189:52 - so that's
189:53 - exactly what i wanted
189:55 - i added my navigation everywhere and um
190:00 - we are good i mean
190:02 - it's valid you alright
190:06 - huh sure we can do that so
190:10 - i'm gonna add in a nice little thing
190:12 - here
190:13 - hopefully it'll let you pick up
190:15 - something too and from valid url so
190:17 - remember we downloaded or sorry we
190:19 - installed this valid url thing
190:21 - now we can actually use it
190:24 - so here's how you would actually use
190:26 - this
190:27 - so let's go down
190:29 - to our uri
190:31 - the only reason why i wanted to fix this
190:33 - is because like if i paste the image
190:35 - here
190:36 - but if it's not an image yet it will
190:37 - actually just give you back blank
190:40 - because
190:42 - it's still something
190:44 - so i wanna make that bug go away
190:47 - so how i'm gonna make that bug go away
190:51 - is right here and all we're going to do
190:54 - is we're going to say a valid url dot is
190:56 - uri
190:58 - wrap this in
191:00 - and if it is then show it so if it's a
191:03 - valid url then show
191:06 - um
191:08 - then show it otherwise show the
191:09 - placeholder the entire freaking time
191:12 - all right so let's try this again
191:16 - and let's go here
191:18 - and let's post an image
191:20 - and let's go back
191:29 - wow
191:30 - that does not do anything how amazing
191:36 - with speech to text using tensorflow oh
191:38 - that'll be fun actually david do you
191:40 - want to write that down text-to-speech
191:42 - with tensorflow i think that could
191:43 - actually be a lot of fun
191:50 - oh
191:52 - and pong says instead of prop drilling
191:54 - navigation the library includes a used
191:56 - navigation hook oh that is nice actually
191:59 - that is a nice one thanks for sharing
192:01 - that i learned something new
192:04 - cool
192:13 - okay
192:15 - so there we go now it's working i just
192:16 - have to like refresh it a bunch of times
192:20 - oh because this is still a valid url
192:23 - that's fine
192:24 - so there we go but if you write like
192:26 - dumb stuff now won't like show you the
192:29 - just the black screen
192:30 - it'll actually keep that placeholder
192:32 - image there the whole time which is
192:35 - exactly what we're looking for
192:36 - so we're good with this now our
192:39 - navigations are working
192:43 - okay
192:44 - and now we're gonna start working on our
192:47 - login screen you guys so let's go to
192:52 - screens
192:53 - and we will remember guys all the
192:55 - screens we're building are right here
192:56 - i'll show you
192:58 - these are the four screens you'll be
192:59 - building in this project
193:01 - all right so we're done with the first
193:04 - two these ones
193:08 - okay so these are the ones that we're
193:09 - pretty much done with
193:12 - now now what we're not done with
193:13 - obviously is the back end of these which
193:15 - is going to require quite a lot of work
193:17 - so
193:17 - that's okay
193:20 - now what we need to build are these ones
193:24 - okay so this this is your the one we're
193:26 - going to be working on right now is this
193:27 - one right here the login one
193:29 - then after that we're gonna build a
193:30 - signup screen
193:32 - okay so let's get to work
193:34 - on the login screen
193:38 - so screens new file
193:40 - will go login screen
193:46 - all right
193:48 - and this is going to be a pretty simple
193:49 - screen i mean i don't want to spend too
193:51 - much time on the screen because
193:53 - it's literally very very simple so we're
193:56 - just gonna paste this because there's no
193:58 - reason there's not a lot going on in
194:00 - here to be honest
194:02 - um
194:04 - okay never mind i changed my mind let's
194:05 - just build it let's just build it that's
194:07 - okay
194:10 - let's go to navigation i'm going to put
194:11 - in login screen here
194:17 - uh yes i'm going to use firebase for
194:19 - back end
194:21 - okay
194:25 - let's go like this
194:27 - login screen
194:32 - cool
194:33 - and we'll do styles
194:36 - style is gonna be styles.container
194:43 - okay
194:44 - and then we're gonna have another view
194:46 - and this will have a style of stylezod
194:50 - logo
195:00 - okay
195:01 - uh and let's now get to work on
195:07 - on this right here
195:09 - we'll have an image
195:13 - and this image will be
195:15 - uri
195:18 - okay and we're gonna now put the
195:19 - instagram logo right here so
195:22 - i'm gonna put that right there
195:26 - okay instagram logo you guys can get it
195:28 - from wherever you want but literally
195:29 - this is the logo that has everything in
195:32 - it thank you so much for the super chat
195:34 - it says uh hey kazzy great work man i've
195:36 - started learning a lot more of react
195:37 - native to these projects great work keep
195:39 - these projects coming absolutely you got
195:41 - it you got it buddy
195:43 - thank you for the super chat
195:47 - okay cool so we got now we're gonna put
195:49 - in that uri right there so i'm gonna say
195:51 - instagram logo
195:53 - and of course let's render the screen
195:55 - out as well
195:57 - so we will
195:59 - i'm gonna just make it implicit return
196:01 - because it just looks cleaner that way
196:13 - so let's refresh our app
196:16 - that's not what it should be doing let's
196:17 - go back
196:19 - login screen oh right i have to add
196:21 - login screen here so we're gonna say
196:24 - login screen i'm gonna go right there
196:26 - and we're gonna say login screen
196:31 - and now it doesn't know what styles is
196:33 - so we're going to say cons styles
196:36 - is equal to style sheet
196:39 - dot create and we're just going to make
196:42 - it empty for now
196:49 - all right so login screen is showing up
196:52 - and it's empty because well we haven't
196:54 - given that logo a size so let's go logo
196:59 - wait let's give the logo a style so we
197:01 - can actually just do that right here
197:03 - here's another way to style things by
197:04 - the way you don't need to
197:06 - give it a style prop all the time you
197:08 - can actually just say you can actually
197:10 - just pass it to source which is
197:12 - interesting
197:14 - so there you go now it's showing up now
197:16 - we need to create some containers so
197:18 - they
197:19 - make this look
197:20 - bearable
197:22 - let's go container
197:24 - and i'm going to give it flex one we'll
197:25 - give it a background color of white and
197:28 - we'll give it a padding top
197:31 - of 50 and then padding horizontal of 12.
197:35 - so let's go there cool
197:38 - now we need a logo container
197:42 - and we're going to go align item center
197:45 - and then we're going to go margin top
197:49 - 60.
197:52 - there we go
197:53 - that's exactly where we want the
197:56 - logo
197:57 - right if we look at the reference screen
197:59 - that we're using you should always have
198:01 - a reference screen that you're working
198:02 - against so this is the reference screen
198:05 - we're currently working against
198:08 - okay
198:09 - that's what it should look like
198:21 - you can use style components as well but
198:23 - i am just deciding to go with regular
198:26 - styles like styles in here because
198:29 - just easy
198:30 - you know um but yeah you could
198:32 - definitely use styled components
198:38 - image source
198:41 - nice
198:42 - wrapped up
198:47 - and then the last thing we're going to
198:48 - need is the login form to show up okay
198:50 - so we're gonna need another component
198:54 - uh and that component is going to be the
198:56 - login form and that's gonna go right
198:58 - underneath this so what that component
199:00 - is gonna look like is gonna be this one
199:01 - right here
199:03 - that
199:05 - all right so that goes
199:07 - right about there
199:13 - so let's leave that right there so you
199:15 - know what we're working on and now let's
199:17 - go ahead and uh start working on this
199:23 - you can still use react uh style
199:25 - components i believe with react native
199:27 - so you should be fine but that's all
199:28 - good yeah
199:36 - all right so let's go over to
199:39 - create a form and we're going to put it
199:41 - inside of our components
199:43 - and we're going to create a new folder
199:45 - too
199:46 - in just a second
199:48 - but login screen so far is looking good
199:50 - let's go ahead and start working on the
199:52 - form now
199:58 - all right since under components
200:01 - we're going to create login screen
200:12 - so a new folder
200:19 - login screen folder
200:21 - uh it doesn't need to be capitalized
200:24 - i like to just keep it like this
200:26 - login screen
200:28 - and they'll have a component inside of
200:30 - there
200:32 - and that'll be called the login forum.js
200:40 - and this is how this one is gonna work
200:41 - so first of all
200:44 - let's just go back to the login screen
200:46 - and comment this
200:49 - in
200:50 - and import it so we got it right there
200:53 - let's have uh some text from it showing
200:55 - up
200:57 - boom so now text is showing up so that's
200:59 - good
201:02 - now we're going to start working on this
201:03 - component itself
201:06 - all right so let's just start off with
201:08 - the text inputs right so that's how i
201:10 - like to start my forms
201:13 - text
201:16 - input
201:17 - import
201:20 - so we're gonna need one text input and
201:21 - we're gonna need two why are we gonna
201:23 - need two text inputs because there's two
201:25 - text input fields
201:27 - okay and then we have a button so two
201:29 - text fields and then a button so
201:32 - i'm gonna go ahead and add that button
201:34 - as well
201:39 - title of this button is gonna just be
201:45 - login
201:50 - login just like that
201:53 - cool
201:54 - and now i'm going to get to work on our
201:56 - text inputs
202:00 - so
202:01 - these are going to be pretty simple i
202:03 - want to get to the more interesting
202:05 - backend parts i'm going to skip through
202:06 - this because we just did all this
202:08 - so placeholder placeholder phone number
202:10 - username email auto capitalize
202:13 - none
202:15 - we're going to have the keyboard type to
202:17 - be email address okay text content type
202:19 - as well and then autofocus for this is
202:21 - going to be true
202:24 - rfce i believe is for
202:27 - react uh
202:29 - react
202:30 - not react native so instead of view and
202:33 - text it won't import that it'll import
202:35 - other stuff so like rfce
202:38 - like doesn't import that
202:40 - so it's very similar but like it also
202:42 - won't auto complete these views here
202:50 - nice
202:54 - all right now so that's our first
202:58 - uh input field
203:01 - okay
203:02 - and now we're gonna have another and
203:03 - let's put uh this both of these input
203:06 - fields inside of a view
203:09 - and this is just so we can style that
203:10 - input field okay so we're just gonna say
203:12 - style is styles
203:14 - dot input field like that
203:19 - okay
203:20 - and um
203:22 - do const style sheet
203:26 - or sorry con styles equal to style sheet
203:32 - dot create
203:34 - leave it empty like this
203:38 - so now i can type in here that's
203:42 - cool let's create another view just like
203:45 - that with the text field it's going to
203:48 - be very similar
203:49 - except
203:50 - the only things that are going to be
203:52 - different about this are the following
203:57 - that so it's going to be a password
203:59 - field
204:01 - capital auto capitalize none autocorrect
204:03 - is going to be disabled secure text
204:05 - entry is going to be true so when i'm
204:07 - typing it actually shows me
204:10 - uh the dots like that
204:19 - perfect
204:21 - we don't need redux
204:23 - for a lot of things
204:25 - um
204:27 - everybody that shows you how to use
204:28 - redux online most of the times just
204:30 - using it for some like
204:32 - bs reason that they don't actually need
204:35 - it for but they just do it so they can
204:37 - get more views on their videos i mean i
204:40 - think for some of the videos we added it
204:42 - maybe even for that reason but like
204:45 - you don't need it as much as you think
204:46 - you do most of the time you don't need
204:48 - it like for managing
204:50 - authentication people always use it but
204:52 - like you don't need it because
204:54 - firebase already has all that
204:56 - information so what we did is we went
204:57 - through this entire project built it
204:59 - with redux added all this redux
205:01 - functionality
205:02 - and then went through it again spent
205:04 - another 30 40 50 hours
205:06 - and just kept stripping out every area
205:09 - that we didn't need i didn't absolutely
205:10 - need redux and we realized like there
205:12 - was actually zero need for redux in this
205:14 - entire project
205:16 - so
205:17 - you don't always need it
205:20 - ronto says it feels great to see such
205:23 - uh great productivity and doing the
205:25 - whole project end to end in one go
205:26 - thanks for providing the hope that with
205:28 - consistency in practice quite a hell of
205:31 - a lot works can be done absolutely
205:33 - if you just say laser focus and you
205:35 - start coding you can get actually a lot
205:37 - done but like you're just keeping your
205:39 - brain sharp is the key thing
205:43 - so we got these two
205:45 - uh now the last thing that we actually
205:47 - need is of course we need to give it
205:48 - some styling so the styling is gonna be
205:50 - pretty simple because we have done this
205:52 - a lot of times now guys i'm gonna be
205:54 - moving through this like a little bit
205:55 - quicker
205:56 - and uh here's the styling for this
206:00 - all right
206:01 - [Music]
206:02 - we got some margin top order radius
206:04 - action going on here
206:07 - okay
206:08 - uh margin
206:09 - bottom and border width
206:13 - let me remove this padding
206:16 - cool and we're gonna align things to be
206:18 - i believe in the center so let's see if
206:21 - we
206:22 - have that somewhere if we didn't do that
206:33 - so let's uh put everything in the
206:35 - wrapper so we're gonna go style is equal
206:38 - to styles
206:40 - dot wrapper
206:42 - there we go
206:51 - okay
206:54 - so now we just need to make it so it
206:55 - looks like how we have it here
207:06 - okay let's see
207:15 - uh-huh
207:17 - view input field
207:22 - input field
207:33 - [Music]
207:42 - oh
207:43 - okay so maybe we might not need this
207:45 - much padding so let's remove let's make
207:48 - the padding
207:50 - patty the battery
207:55 - field can we do a line items center
207:59 - that's not what i wanted
208:01 - justify content center
208:05 - that's not what i wanted either
208:11 - [Music]
208:13 - okay
208:15 - that looks good enough for me
208:22 - okay cool
208:27 - [Music]
208:36 - okay david if you can spot the bug here
208:38 - let me know but like it's slightly off i
208:40 - believe from what we're trying to
208:42 - achieve
208:43 - the text being in the center
208:45 - so if there's a slight bug that i have
208:47 - here
208:49 - uh do let me know that'd be much
208:51 - appreciated
208:53 - but like i cannot
208:56 - uh find it i can i'll i'm starting a
208:59 - live share so if you want to jump in
209:00 - here you're welcome too
209:04 - yeah i don't get what the bug is but if
209:05 - you figure it out great so because i
209:07 - want to just keep this thing moving
209:10 - so padding
209:13 - login form
209:15 - so the padding that we have is 12
209:18 - but clearly it looks too big but that's
209:20 - okay we're gonna keep on trucking guys
209:26 - just go eight for now
209:32 - do i have like three text inputs or
209:34 - something oh
209:37 - oh
209:39 - oh
209:41 - oh
209:43 - okay
209:44 - there we go
209:46 - does it still look right though
209:51 - it kind of does
209:53 - like the borders look too dark
210:05 - yeah my text input i just had like text
210:07 - inputs within text inputs
210:09 - um and that was creating the problem but
210:12 - now it's looking better so
210:15 - there we go
210:17 - awesome
210:20 - now we're gonna do some more stuff to
210:22 - the login form
210:24 - okay and when i say more stuff we're
210:26 - gonna be adding um
210:28 - we're definitely gonna be adding like
210:29 - the forgot password and the account
210:31 - password thing and the login button
210:33 - we're gonna make it look nice as well
210:36 - so right here
210:38 - let's go
210:40 - and uh build a forgot password section
210:43 - so right underneath this password i'm
210:45 - going to get
210:49 - right below it
210:51 - and we're going to create a view
210:53 - and inside of this view we're going to
210:55 - say text
210:57 - and this text will say
211:00 - forgot password
211:04 - all right
211:05 - and now we're going to move that to the
211:07 - right
211:13 - there we go flex end
211:17 - and we'll give it a margin bottom of 30.
211:22 - so now login is moved down
211:24 - and let's give this text a color
211:27 - so we're gonna go color
211:31 - and uh it'll be like this bluish color
211:34 - there we go
211:39 - beautiful
211:40 - now this button that we have
211:42 - instead of a button being login i'm
211:45 - gonna just call it pressable and
211:47 - pressable gives me nice things
211:50 - let's go pressable here
211:54 - and
211:55 - what's cool about pressable is that you
211:57 - can write text inside of it
212:03 - pressable
212:05 - and inside of the pressable
212:11 - we can have text
212:13 - and that text can say login
212:17 - now it's complaining probably about it
212:19 - doesn't know what pressable is so let's
212:21 - just import it
212:26 - okay
212:29 - and let's go
212:31 - title size is
212:36 - 20
212:38 - we'll go style this styles
212:41 - dot button
212:44 - and we'll we'll create the styling for
212:45 - it now so let's go right here and we'll
212:47 - go button
212:55 - so this is the styling for the button
212:58 - okay
212:59 - and uh basically what this will do is
213:02 - give it a background color align it to
213:04 - center so if i remove this you can see
213:05 - it moves it all the way to the left this
213:07 - will align it vertically in this case we
213:11 - give it a min height so the button
213:12 - actually has a certain height and then
213:14 - we give it a border radius so it looks a
213:16 - little bit rounder and nicer
213:22 - cool
213:24 - and then we're also going to have a
213:25 - button text styling so i'm going to put
213:27 - that right down here
213:28 - and it will have a font weight of 600
213:31 - it'll be white with font size of 20.
213:34 - so here we'll go here and we'll say
213:36 - style
213:38 - styles
213:39 - dot
213:40 - button text
213:43 - there we go
213:46 - so now it's looking pretty nice
213:54 - we should be able to click this too
213:57 - so you guys won't be able to see if
213:58 - we're clicking it or not so i'll add on
214:00 - press and i'll just write console.log
214:03 - you clicked me
214:06 - just like that and if i click it you can
214:08 - see it says you clicked me even though
214:09 - it doesn't have that touchable opacity
214:11 - thing that the other
214:13 - uh that touchable opacity has
214:17 - but that's okay and now we're gonna add
214:20 - a sign up container so we're just gonna
214:23 - do
214:38 - i'm gonna do sign up
214:40 - container
214:43 - and then we're gonna say
214:48 - don't have an account
214:50 - question mark and then do that
214:54 - let's give it a
214:56 - touchable opacity
215:01 - oh not not touchable that's not what i
215:03 - meant
215:05 - touchable opacity
215:10 - and inside of touchable opacity i'm
215:12 - going to have text
215:16 - that pretty much just does this we don't
215:18 - need to do first styles we can actually
215:20 - just create a style right here and i can
215:22 - say color
215:26 - and we'll give it that same color right
215:28 - there
215:36 - okay so now we just got to style the
215:38 - sign up container
215:45 - there we go so sign up container flex
215:47 - direction row which is 100
215:50 - uh
215:52 - it will basically align horizontally
215:56 - if i remove the width
215:58 - right you actually you might not need
215:59 - the width in this case i'm leaving it
216:01 - anyway flex row will make it so it's not
216:04 - in columns and then margin top will give
216:06 - it a margin from
216:07 - the login button
216:10 - all right so that's what signup
216:11 - container is and that's what it does
216:14 - let's go and let's put a space right
216:16 - there
216:19 - you can put a space wherever you want
216:20 - either with the sign up or after the
216:22 - account
216:23 - whichever one either one works
216:25 - so now the login screen guys is looking
216:28 - pretty freaking good
216:30 - what do you think
216:31 - if you think the login screen is looking
216:33 - pretty freaking good let me know in the
216:35 - comments below
216:37 - and uh of course we still need to add
216:40 - some more functionality to it like
216:41 - actually add formic so they can validate
216:43 - it but
216:44 - you know it's looking pretty damn good
216:46 - to me
216:47 - log in sign up
216:49 - dope
216:54 - cool
216:56 - hey getting some thumbs up nice i see it
217:18 - okay just double checking everything
217:21 - looks good to me to be honest and now
217:23 - we're just going to complete this login
217:25 - form we don't need touchable and we
217:26 - don't need button i'm going to remove
217:29 - that
217:30 - now guys we're gonna wrap it in formic
217:33 - okay so from formic we're going to
217:35 - import a couple of things
217:38 - um and not all of this from formic so
217:40 - i'm importing formic from formic
217:42 - okay and
217:45 - importing this and i'm also getting an
217:47 - email validator so we can actually
217:49 - install this together just do yarn add
217:52 - email validator
217:58 - cool so now this is installed so these
218:01 - three imports we're gonna need
218:03 - let's also we're gonna need to keep
218:05 - track of states so let's just go use
218:06 - state
218:09 - all right
218:10 - and now we need a login form schema
218:14 - okay so basically we're going to do just
218:16 - that so let's go out here that's not
218:18 - what i meant
218:21 - that's what i mean
218:22 - all right so this schema login form
218:24 - schema basically saying
218:27 - for email
218:29 - get me the email
218:30 - for password
218:32 - make sure that it's a string that of
218:35 - eight characters this is validating it's
218:36 - an email this is validating it's eight
218:38 - and if it's not eight then your password
218:40 - has to be at least eight characters very
218:43 - easy uh both of these are required so
218:45 - you can't even hit submit unless you do
218:48 - that
218:50 - and now we're gonna start adding in the
218:52 - formic part so within this wrapper right
218:54 - here
218:55 - we're going to start our formic right
218:57 - here
218:59 - and we will finish
219:03 - our formic
219:07 - all the way at the bottom
219:14 - like
219:15 - right there
219:21 - okay and then we're gonna wrap all of
219:24 - this stuff inside of like the
219:26 - formic juice
219:28 - as we call it so first of all let's just
219:30 - give formic a couple of its props that
219:32 - it's looking for so initial values
219:34 - will be
219:37 - email
219:40 - and the next one is going to be password
219:43 - and but they're both going to start off
219:44 - as empty
219:47 - we're going to have on submit
219:49 - and for now we're just going to say
219:54 - get me the values
219:56 - and simply just do
219:57 - console.log actually we're going to do
219:59 - this because we're going to need to do
220:00 - more stuff later
220:02 - so let's go here and let's just say
220:04 - console log me the values and the next
220:06 - thing we're going to need is the give it
220:08 - the validation schema
220:10 - and we're going to validate on mount to
220:13 - be true
220:14 - so it validates right away
220:16 - cool and now we need the weird part of
220:19 - formic
220:21 - here we go
220:26 - so it's an anonymous function that's
220:28 - going to take in a bunch of things
220:30 - handle change
220:31 - handle
220:33 - blur
220:34 - handle submit
220:36 - values it's getting all of this from the
220:38 - formic form itself
220:42 - okay
220:44 - and now
220:50 - we're gonna just go and do this
221:00 - okay cool so you see this arrow function
221:03 - right there
221:05 - uh all of this stuff is gonna be inside
221:07 - of it and then we're just gonna go all
221:09 - the way down and we're gonna start
221:10 - closing stuff now
221:14 - so right around right about here we're
221:17 - going to start closing things we're
221:18 - going to close close
221:21 - is there any other ones so we need to
221:22 - close
221:25 - must have one parent element
221:27 - so in order to give it a parent element
221:29 - we can just give it a
221:33 - like a gsx fragment type of situation
221:36 - that should be fine so let's go ahead
221:38 - and do that right here
221:40 - go in
221:41 - like that
221:47 - and then go all the way up here
221:51 - thank you david very helpful that's cool
221:54 - hey let's go
221:58 - that's super helpful
222:01 - nice
222:02 - pair programming let's go
222:05 - that's exciting
222:10 - move the whole view to the middle it
222:11 - looks sick all right hedaya thank you
222:16 - looking great
222:17 - looking good
222:19 - so fair says not good nice
222:23 - nice guys your best looking pretty good
222:25 - beautiful thank you
222:28 - okay so now this whole thing is
222:33 - uh doing what it needs to do
222:35 - and now we need to actually start doing
222:37 - stuff with this information okay
222:44 - so we're gonna go down here to the email
222:46 - one and we're gonna add like three more
222:48 - props
222:49 - and this is what they are
222:51 - these three that i just added so on
222:53 - change handle change email on blur
222:56 - handle blur email and value values that
222:59 - email so these three you're gonna need
223:00 - to add
223:01 - for password we're gonna need to do a
223:03 - very similar thing
223:06 - let's go here
223:07 - boom boom
223:09 - very similar
223:11 - all right so now we're done with the
223:12 - password part
223:14 - now we just need to go to our pressable
223:16 - button and tell it hey when you
223:19 - um
223:20 - when somebody presses you don't run this
223:23 - freaking code
223:24 - actually do
223:25 - handle submit
223:30 - okay so handle submit is what we get
223:33 - from here
223:35 - and it sends it over to the on submit
223:39 - all right there we go
223:41 - so now if i hit save
223:43 - if i type stuff in and it hit login it
223:45 - doesn't work if i type stuff in and hit
223:47 - login it still doesn't work if i type in
223:49 - a valid email
223:51 - and then i hit login oh i'll remove the
223:54 - form out of the way so you guys can see
223:57 - and now when i hit login
224:01 - so now it works you see that
224:03 - because it was validating that this is
224:05 - greater than eight characters and it was
224:07 - validating that this is an email for
224:08 - example if i remove this at sign
224:12 - and now i hit login it actually won't do
224:14 - it because it's not validating right
224:16 - from the front end now when i do it it
224:17 - will so
224:19 - pretty freaking cool right
224:24 - so super super freaking awesome
224:32 - all right now we just need to do a
224:34 - couple of more things i need to give it
224:35 - a nice little
224:36 - uh style for validation though
224:40 - yeah let's do it why not
224:43 - so let's make this button a dynamic
224:45 - button and we're gonna do
224:48 - you're gonna take in is valid
224:50 - all right and then you're gonna return
224:53 - me an object based on that
225:00 - all right
225:02 - now
225:04 - background color is basically going to
225:05 - go is valid if it is valid then i want
225:08 - you to give me
225:10 - the fully blue one otherwise give me the
225:12 - lighter blue one so let's go here
225:16 - david what's that color extension that
225:17 - shows all the hex colors is it like hex
225:20 - something
225:24 - color
225:26 - color highlight
225:28 - that's the one right
225:29 - yes sir
225:31 - beautiful let's install it let's go back
225:34 - all right there we go
225:36 - color highlight thank you for the
225:38 - comment nice that's sick
225:40 - so you guys can see what colors i'm
225:42 - giving it right here now
225:48 - i thought i installed it like why did it
225:50 - not install it globally it's weird
225:57 - hey nazrul says great work brother worth
226:00 - not sleeping tonight
226:02 - hell yeah
226:06 - yes disable the button if empty field by
226:08 - using disabled so i'll show you
226:10 - um how to use disabled properly so this
226:13 - valid
226:15 - on on the pressable component
226:18 - right we're actually going to pass it uh
226:24 - i'm gonna actually pass it is styling
226:29 - i don't need to disable it because it
226:31 - will already be disabled from formic
226:33 - itself okay all i need to do is actually
226:36 - just pass it styling that's all i need
226:38 - to do disabled i don't need to worry
226:39 - about
226:43 - on press
226:44 - no no no no no what am i doing
226:47 - so for the style
226:49 - what we're going to do is we're just
226:50 - going to say styles out button but now
226:53 - it's a function and we're going to give
226:55 - it is valid and if it's valid
226:58 - then it will be blue otherwise it won't
226:59 - be blue so let's make it not valid so
227:02 - boom it just becomes a lighter blue but
227:04 - then as soon as it's valid it's like
227:06 - that okay and let's actually test
227:08 - disabled i don't know the api of
227:10 - pressable but but i think it works
227:13 - so there you go like you can even pass
227:15 - it and disable like that
227:19 - cool
227:20 - so like
227:22 - when it's disabled it doesn't work i hit
227:24 - login
227:25 - login login login doesn't work then as
227:27 - soon as this is valid
227:29 - well the email is now not valid
227:32 - there we go
227:37 - so very nice
227:39 - way of doing it
227:41 - and now let me actually see if we want
227:43 - to add in the email validator situation
227:47 - um
227:48 - it's pretty cool
227:49 - it's actually pretty cool we can do it
227:52 - so let's go all the way to the top and
227:54 - let's go to this view for the first text
227:57 - component and what i want to do here's
227:59 - what i want to do okay
228:02 - what i want to do is
228:04 - when a user doesn't type in anything
228:06 - let's say the user just comes to this
228:07 - page
228:09 - this should not um
228:11 - this should be as it is but as soon as
228:13 - the user types so basically
228:16 - here's what i want if there's a wrong
228:17 - input the border should turn red if it's
228:21 - an invalid input
228:23 - if it's a valid input the border should
228:25 - just become normal
228:27 - for both of these fields
228:30 - so it creates a seamless experience for
228:32 - the user without having to say these
228:33 - like big error messages like this is not
228:36 - valid and like saying it right there i
228:37 - just want the subtle red to show up and
228:39 - as soon as you're correct um
228:43 - it just goes away
228:45 - also
228:46 - if you don't type in anything it should
228:48 - stay as it is as soon as you start
228:50 - typing it goes red and as soon as it's
228:52 - valid it goes away okay so there's a
228:54 - couple of case scenarios we have to take
228:56 - care of
228:57 - so now let's go ahead and style these
228:59 - input fields and for style i'm going to
229:01 - say cells input field let's make it an
229:04 - array
229:06 - so the first style should be whatever it
229:08 - is in here the second style should be
229:10 - the dynamic one
229:13 - so this dynamic styling
229:15 - now will be based on the following we'll
229:17 - say border
229:19 - color will be if values.email
229:22 - dot length is less than one
229:26 - then validator
229:29 - dot
229:31 - validate
229:33 - values.email
229:37 - and if it's true give me back
229:40 - it's regular
229:42 - otherwise give me back
229:44 - uh red
229:46 - okay
229:56 - wait what the heck is it freaking out
229:57 - about
230:04 - oh i have to give it an object
230:07 - so let's put it in an object thing
230:10 - like that
230:12 - all right so this is an object and this
230:15 - whole thing will resolve to
230:18 - either this
230:21 - or this
230:25 - okay
230:28 - so now let's check it out
230:33 - it turns red
230:35 - and then let's see if it becomes valid
230:37 - as soon as it becomes valid notice guys
230:40 - right as soon as it becomes valid it
230:42 - starts becoming unread
230:44 - and at the same time the blue button
230:47 - will start to kick in too
230:49 - like that's pretty freaking nice
230:55 - so there we go
230:58 - that takes care of all the case
231:00 - scenarios right if it's less than one
231:02 - then do the thing
231:04 - um
231:05 - yeah so
231:07 - boom we're good with this
231:10 - and now we want to do a very similar
231:12 - thing with the next one as well
231:16 - for the passwords basically
231:24 - okay so let's go to the password
231:26 - and for the styling we're going to do it
231:28 - very similarly
231:30 - and the first one is going to be an
231:32 - input field
231:33 - and then we're going to do this if
231:35 - password length is in between so this is
231:38 - a nice way of saying in between it's
231:40 - kind of pythonic it almost looks like
231:41 - python
231:44 - but basically this is saying if the
231:46 - password length is in between one and
231:47 - six isn't that cool
231:50 - that's kind of cool or if you want to be
231:52 - technical as two and six but like yeah
231:54 - one and six right
231:55 - so i really really like this because
231:57 - it's super clean
232:01 - um and if it's in between that
232:04 - then um you know give me blah blah blah
232:07 - or red
232:09 - okay and as soon as because if if it's
232:11 - less than one it means the user hasn't
232:13 - started typing
232:14 - if it's
232:16 - more than six it means that whatever the
232:18 - user has wrote is valid
232:20 - okay and i'll make the minimum six here
232:22 - as well because it should really be six
232:24 - not eight so let's make that six
232:28 - and now let's come back here and type
232:31 - so right now see you see nothing but
232:33 - then when i go one two three four five
232:36 - six oh
232:37 - that is nice look at that no red one two
232:41 - three four five six
232:43 - no back to no red that's so clean right
232:48 - so as soon as these errors go away
232:50 - the button becomes blue at the bottom
232:52 - and it's just so freaking clean like
232:55 - subtle subtle little things they make it
232:57 - look so good penelope says for us
232:59 - beginners this is like watching a magic
233:01 - show that is the best compliment you can
233:03 - honestly give me because my whole dream
233:06 - and what i share with my team as well is
233:08 - like how can we make this so it feels
233:09 - like a magic show
233:11 - that's like the best compliment you
233:12 - could have ever given is awesome
233:16 - amazing
233:18 - okay
233:20 - great
233:21 - so we are done
233:24 - with our login page honestly it's it's a
233:27 - heavy heavy work that we had to do but
233:31 - we're good with it
233:34 - like this is a solid login why i went
233:36 - like why we went above and beyond like
233:39 - when david and i were building this for
233:40 - you guys is so you can
233:42 - re keep reusing this and any new
233:45 - projects that you do
233:47 - even years later because the code is so
233:49 - clean and it's built so well that you
233:51 - can keep reusing this exact way
233:56 - okay
233:58 - boom boom
233:59 - now we're gonna add a sign up screen
234:03 - okay and the sign up screen is going to
234:05 - be
234:06 - honestly very very similar in
234:10 - in terms of what we do
234:12 - okay
234:14 - so sign up screen i will literally paste
234:16 - it there's not much to talk about
234:18 - and don't want to waste too much time on
234:20 - it
234:21 - so let's go screens new file and we'll
234:24 - do signup
234:25 - screen dot js
234:29 - all right so what's going on here
234:31 - look it's very similar to the login
234:34 - screen okay you got the instagram logo
234:38 - you got a stylus container you have a
234:40 - logo container
234:42 - all right the logo has a height we got
234:44 - the signup form
234:46 - uh we got all the stylings for the logo
234:48 - container and whatever it's literally
234:51 - currently a
234:52 - or it's a replica of sinus uh login
234:55 - signup is literally a replica of login
234:58 - the only difference is
235:00 - that it has maybe an extra field
235:05 - [Music]
235:09 - cool
235:11 - now let's go to our navigation
235:14 - and here we're going to switch to sign
235:16 - up screen so let's see that it hopefully
235:19 - takes us to the sign up screen let's
235:21 - refresh
235:24 - um
235:25 - weird
235:28 - it doesn't know about signup screen
235:29 - that's what it is cool
235:32 - i learned something new if your initial
235:34 - route doesn't match it just gives you
235:36 - the first one from the stack ah david
235:38 - look at that learning new
235:40 - things hey
235:42 - so we're gonna do sign up screen i'm
235:44 - gonna go sign up
235:47 - screen
235:48 - and my throat is so dry
235:51 - live streams are unhealthy
235:56 - okay let's refresh
236:12 - boom sign up screen is showing up
236:14 - beautiful okay there we go that's the
236:17 - signup screen very simple very easy
236:20 - pretty much the same styling and all
236:22 - that stuff everywhere okay so we are
236:24 - good we are good
236:27 - so sign up screen is gucci now we need
236:30 - to add the sign up form to the sign up
236:32 - screen okay
236:34 - this is also going to be very very
236:37 - similar it's pretty much going to be a
236:39 - copy pasta i'll just show you where the
236:41 - differences are
236:43 - again very similar
236:45 - so
236:47 - we'll make a new component we'll make a
236:49 - new folder this will be called like sign
236:51 - up screen
236:53 - this will have a
236:56 - file inside of it that's going to say
236:57 - sign up form dot js
237:01 - and i'm just going to paste this okay
237:03 - and let's just take a look at first what
237:05 - it is and what it looks like
237:07 - so let's import now sign up form
237:10 - it's importing it let's
237:14 - none of these files exist
237:18 - oh oh okay wait hold on that's not what
237:21 - i meant to do just ignore me for a
237:23 - second guys
237:26 - let's make this error go away
237:38 - okay
237:42 - so i'm just gonna paste it here like
237:44 - this
237:51 - uh-huh and i'll just explain like what
237:53 - each of these things is doing as we kind
237:55 - of go through this
238:01 - okay
238:02 - so
238:03 - sign up form
238:05 - is going to have a signup form schema
238:08 - email username and password whereas the
238:11 - login form
238:12 - had a email and password
238:15 - all right so
238:16 - slightly different schema but
238:18 - essentially very similar username should
238:20 - be a minimum of two characters
238:22 - password should be six should be
238:24 - required
238:26 - and email should uh be an email and
238:28 - required okay so similar
238:31 - stuff so far
238:39 - all right
238:48 - okay
238:49 - again i'm just gonna bring this in
238:52 - so once i bring it in then i'm gonna
238:54 - explain as i
238:56 - bring it in for you guys
239:03 - okay so just give me a second here guys
239:05 - [Music]
239:06 - need a little bit of patience
239:09 - and i will explain everything don't
239:11 - worry i promise i know it looks like oh
239:12 - so much but it's not it's copy paste of
239:16 - um
239:18 - the the page that we just finished
239:20 - building so
239:25 - [Music]
239:30 - [Music]
239:36 - [Music]
239:38 - okay cool
239:39 - and then i'm gonna add in the styling as
239:41 - well because the styling is gonna be
239:43 - pretty much the same
239:48 - okay cool now the sign up form we just
239:50 - gotta make sure it shows up so let's go
239:52 - back to the sign up screen and let's
239:56 - make sure it shows up
239:57 - say refresh
239:59 - [Music]
240:01 - uh what's the error we're having right
240:03 - now invalid expected a string but got an
240:06 - object
240:15 - free javascript yes
240:17 - so sign up screen line
240:21 - all right that shouldn't be the problem
240:23 - sign up form
240:25 - [Music]
240:29 - sign up form
240:31 - am i exporting it
240:35 - oh i'm not exporting it i'm an idiot
240:37 - all right so i'm gonna export it david
240:39 - you want to do okay
240:41 - oh you got it okay my bad you got it got
240:43 - it
240:44 - so um
240:45 - we i just didn't export it that's all
240:47 - that's a problem i don't know why there
240:49 - wasn't just telling me that there was
240:51 - like well if you go and you go to
240:54 - best boy and buy a tv then you'll be all
240:57 - right it's like what the air is i'm not
241:00 - exporting it like tell me that
241:06 - [Music]
241:15 - la porta says it's a little overwhelming
241:17 - for a change into tech
241:19 - so yeah these ones are more advanced i
241:21 - suggest if you're a complete beginner
241:23 - watch the beginner tutorials of like
241:26 - us just doing javascript by itself like
241:28 - if you watch my javascript tutorial
241:30 - that's made for complete beginners i'll
241:31 - make a lot more stuff for complete
241:33 - beginners this is just to show you like
241:35 - what you can do what's possible
241:41 - all right so i'll explain this guys as
241:43 - we go along but uh
241:46 - essentially the sign up form right so
241:48 - the schema is this
241:51 - all right and the schema essentially
241:53 - states
241:54 - this is this is how it needs to be okay
241:56 - after that we still have the wrapper
241:59 - just like the login screen
242:02 - or just like the login form
242:05 - right styles wrapper
242:07 - let's go back we still have formic we
242:09 - still are taking initial values the only
242:11 - difference is email username and
242:13 - password are the values on submit we're
242:15 - just console logging stuff
242:18 - validation schema is the one that we
242:21 - created up there validate on mount is
242:23 - still true we're still doing this handle
242:25 - change channel blur blah blah getting
242:26 - all this stuff right there that we need
242:30 - right the rest of it is very similar
242:33 - guys i don't even need to go over a lot
242:35 - of that okay it's very very similar
242:38 - the only things
242:39 - are that now three fields have this uh
242:42 - validation
242:44 - right so like for example this is red
242:45 - this is red this is red
242:47 - that we need this we have three text
242:50 - input fields now instead of two so the
242:53 - second one is the user name one
242:56 - right and the first one is the email one
242:58 - which is the same as the login one
243:01 - okay and um
243:04 - yeah we have a pressable button that
243:06 - does literally the same thing
243:08 - all right except we probably just want
243:10 - to call it like
243:11 - sign up and sign up one word david or is
243:14 - it do they write it as two sign up right
243:16 - probably two words
243:18 - two words got it thank you
243:25 - um
243:26 - cool
243:28 - already have an account log in
243:32 - dope
243:36 - okay so now this looks good let's test
243:38 - if it works i'll do causey at clever so
243:41 - sign up is disabled currently
243:44 - we'll do usernames clever causey
243:47 - and password is one two three four five
243:49 - six
243:51 - ah there we go so it works
243:53 - it's
243:54 - let's say my username is two characters
243:56 - or sorry less than two characters
243:59 - it has a problem with it
244:00 - hey what's up nazare let's go
244:05 - keep at it hell yeah bro i'm gonna keep
244:08 - at it dawg
244:11 - took over the whole screen
244:13 - all right cool
244:17 - all right guys this is looking honestly
244:19 - phenomenal it looks sexy make sure you
244:21 - have all these imports but essentially a
244:24 - replica of login form
244:26 - so we're good now we want to add
244:28 - navigation guys so we want to be able to
244:30 - navigate back and forth between these
244:32 - screens for example when i click the
244:34 - login button it should navigate me back
244:36 - all right so let's go
244:39 - what's up boy
244:45 - all right so let's add that
244:48 - nas says i'm working on the youtube

251:03 - uh the iphone mock-up on the right mark
251:06 - is simply a
251:09 - simulator it's the simulator that comes
251:12 - with
251:12 - expo so i didn't do anything expo was
251:15 - nice enough to do it for me
251:20 - all right so we got the database going
251:22 - so that's good the next thing we need to
251:24 - know do is go let's go into
251:25 - authentication let's hit get started and
251:28 - the only authentication we need for this
251:30 - one is email and password so let's click
251:32 - enable
251:35 - and
251:35 - [Music]
251:39 - that's really it
251:43 - so that should be good
251:45 - all right cool
251:47 - cool beans
251:56 - all right so let's
251:59 - create a firebase js so i'm going to go
252:01 - new file we're going to go firebase.js
252:04 - and
252:06 - you know what the deal is you know what
252:08 - to do
252:10 - you're just going to copy pasta
252:13 - everything you got from there
252:20 - do a sas bootstrap
252:22 - nice that's a good idea payment push
252:24 - notification user auth content
252:25 - management i like it
252:28 - i like it
252:33 - all right cool
252:34 - so now we just got to do a couple of
252:36 - things so here's a snippet of code
252:38 - that's helpful and
252:40 - what this will do is if there's an app
252:42 - um all this is doing is can i write it
252:46 - on like separate lines so you guys can
252:48 - see it easier
252:50 - if the app ex doesn't exist initialize
252:53 - it if it does exist use it
253:00 - export default firebase
253:04 - okay and then from here this is the old
253:06 - firebase way of doing it
253:08 - um
253:09 - but i'll show you guys the new way at
253:10 - some point but for now this is all right
253:16 - that's what your file should look like
253:18 - okay right now
253:20 - so there we go
253:23 - oh baby
253:28 - awesome thank you
253:29 - cool
253:33 - hey that guy says i'm from scotland land
253:35 - of the loch ness welcome
253:40 - all right so we're done with firebase js
253:42 - file
253:45 - okay
253:48 - and then we just need to install a
253:50 - couple more things so
253:52 - we're just going to install firebase so
253:54 - let's do expo install firebase this is a
253:57 - little hack guys make sure you get this
253:58 - right if you don't get this right you're
254:00 - going to be crying and you'll be like i
254:02 - didn't cause you didn't told me
254:05 - i'm telling you right now i'm also
254:06 - zooming in so david or somebody help
254:10 - i'm gonna forget to zoom out so i'm
254:12 - gonna hit enter
254:13 - expo install firebase very important you
254:15 - do that
254:17 - if you don't do that you're gonna run
254:18 - into weird errors and you're gonna have
254:19 - no idea why
254:24 - telegram clone nice sounds like a cool
254:26 - idea amazon mobile clone
254:28 - that'll be fun
254:31 - we need that whatsapp clone for real for
254:33 - real hey good news for you my friend
254:39 - almost got that in the bag
254:47 - all right so expo installed so we've
254:50 - installed firebase now that's good now
254:52 - let's go into login form and guys watch
254:54 - how easy this is going to be this is
254:55 - going to be really really nice
254:57 - so a few things that we need to actually
254:59 - do
255:01 - all right we need to import firebase
255:03 - from
255:06 - firebase
255:08 - okay
255:09 - i'm i'm also going to get alert
255:13 - from react native because i'm going to
255:14 - use it
255:16 - okay
255:18 - and uh here's what we're gonna do we're
255:20 - gonna create a function
255:22 - right underneath the schema and it's
255:25 - gonna be called on login
255:28 - and it's gonna be an async and it's
255:29 - gonna take an email and password
255:32 - and uh
255:33 - here's what it's going to do we're going
255:34 - to do try
255:36 - we're going to do a try catch block so
255:39 - catch an error
255:41 - and uh
255:42 - i want you to just alert me with that
255:44 - error
255:46 - okay and we're gonna do
255:48 - oh wow thank you very nice so await
255:51 - firebase auth dot sign in with email and
255:54 - password and then we're gonna pass in
255:56 - the email and password
255:58 - all right
256:01 - that should log us in and once that logs
256:03 - us in we're just going to say
256:04 - console.log
256:10 - i'm just going to say firebase login
256:16 - firebase login successful
256:25 - cool
256:26 - and then we're gonna pass in my email
256:28 - and we're gonna also
256:30 - just console log my email and password
256:32 - okay just for now
256:34 - um
256:36 - oh i should have tunneled this app right
256:38 - david when we were demoing it we're
256:40 - idiots
256:41 - there's like so much we forgot like
256:43 - there's so many features i forgot to
256:45 - highlight like it's insane next time
256:47 - let's write down a list of all of them
256:48 - so like
256:50 - i can't forget because there's just so
256:52 - much functionality we added to it
256:59 - what's up john from philippines big fan
257:01 - of clever programmer welcome my friend
257:03 - nice to have you here
257:15 - all right here we go
257:17 - so alert alert
257:19 - dope
257:20 - um
257:21 - honestly we might be pretty much done
257:25 - actually all we need to do is that on
257:27 - submit function we just need to say
257:30 - do this on login thing and give it uh
257:34 - values dot
257:36 - email and values our password
257:40 - so the on login function will now have
257:42 - access to the email and password so
257:44 - let's try it now let's try logging
257:47 - sign in with email and password so this
257:50 - will sign in if there's already an
257:51 - existing
257:55 - account
257:56 - i believe so let's just give it a try
258:00 - actually there are no existing accounts
258:01 - right now right so for example
258:03 - if i go to firebase that we started
258:16 - all right let's go here let's go to
258:20 - users you can see there's no user right
258:21 - now so i'll just add in a user
258:24 - and i'll go cozy cleverprogrammer.com
258:26 - and password will do one two four five
258:28 - six so i'm just like hard coding adding
258:30 - in the user
258:46 - cool
258:51 - all right so now if i
258:54 - sign in it will say that that's correct
258:56 - okay so let's give it a try let's
258:57 - refresh
259:00 - and let's go cozy at clever
259:04 - programmer.com let's hit one two three
259:06 - four five six hit login
259:08 - hey it says firebase login successful
259:10 - look at that you guys already working
259:12 - let's go seven
259:15 - the the password is invalid or the user
259:17 - does not have a password so notice right
259:19 - if i just type in a dummy password
259:20 - that's wrong
259:22 - the user is invalid the password is not
259:25 - there right so that's how i did the
259:26 - alert
259:27 - now i'm going to show you guys something
259:28 - cool you can do with alert so some of
259:30 - these parts again i'm gonna go over them
259:33 - a little bit faster
259:39 - okay and i'll show you that you can
259:40 - actually do this so watch this now watch
259:42 - what happens if i put in the wrong
259:43 - password it goes melode the password is
259:46 - invalid or the user does not have a
259:48 - password
259:49 - what would you like to do next and you
259:51 - should be able to hit sign up and it
259:53 - should take you to the sign up screen
259:54 - right and you should be able to go back
259:56 - as well so a fun little thing that you
259:59 - can actually do or you can just hit ok
260:01 - and it goes away so
260:04 - uh for example how does my alert has
260:07 - this button and this button something
260:09 - cool we figured out so here's how it
260:11 - works alert is a function the first
260:14 - thing it takes in is the actual message
260:16 - right so i'm giving it the actual
260:19 - message here
260:20 - and um
260:22 - the oh sorry so it's a function that's
260:24 - taking in multiple things the first
260:25 - thing is the title so that's the my lord
260:28 - part
260:30 - the second thing is the actual message
260:32 - which is right there
260:33 - okay and then the third thing is the
260:36 - buttons that you're giving it right so
260:38 - for example i'm saying
260:41 - uh give me an okay button right there
260:44 - and style it with the cancel styling so
260:47 - it has a slightly bold okay
260:50 - i can
260:51 - give me the sign up button right there
260:53 - this will have the default styling so i
260:54 - don't need to ask you to do anything
260:56 - and then when you do okay on press all i
260:59 - want you to do is just print out okay
261:01 - and do nothing
261:03 - and then when i hit sign up i want you
261:05 - to navigation.push push me to the home
261:08 - signup screen
261:10 - all right so alert is pretty cool you
261:12 - can do a lot with it okay
261:14 - and we can do friendly error messages
261:17 - like that
261:18 - and if i go one two three four five
261:21 - one two three four five six it's correct
261:23 - and if i hit login i just get firebase
261:24 - login successful
261:27 - okay
261:28 - so our login is
261:30 - absolutely working like we wanted to
261:34 - now we need to add these new users that
261:37 - are signed up to our own database so
261:40 - let's go to our signup form now
261:44 - and we're going to do pretty similar
261:46 - stuff
261:48 - all right inside of our signup form
261:50 - we're going to go const
261:52 - on sign up
261:55 - async
261:57 - email password
262:00 - all right and i want you to do try
262:03 - and
262:04 - then catch any errors
262:10 - and uh for errors i'm just gonna do
262:12 - alert alert and we're gonna go fire here
262:15 - and
262:16 - we're gonna say
262:20 - my load
262:22 - and then we're gonna say here
262:24 - error.message
262:26 - thank you
262:28 - let's go we just got protein shake in
262:30 - the house
262:32 - thank you baby
262:35 - zoom says this is mind blowing i love
262:37 - coding i love programming big shout out
262:39 - to you bro this is awesome content thank
262:41 - you so much
262:42 - i appreciate that
262:51 - oh yeah i haven't ate yet either damn
262:54 - wow
262:56 - my
262:58 - calories cool
263:01 - so we got our try we got our catch
263:03 - inside inside of our try we need to
263:05 - actually do a couple of things
263:08 - we need to say await
263:11 - firebase.auth.create
263:14 - user with email and
263:22 - uh can we import firebase actually or is
263:25 - it not imported
263:27 - so let's import it here let's go import
263:29 - firebase from
263:32 - firebase
263:34 - so basically i'm saying go two folders
263:36 - back import firebase from there boom
263:37 - done
263:38 - firebase dot
263:42 - auth
263:43 - and we'll say create user with email
263:46 - and password and then we pass it email
263:48 - and password
263:49 - and then we will say
263:56 - password okay
264:00 - so firebase user created successfully
264:02 - based on the email and password that was
264:04 - put in on the sign up page
264:06 - and otherwise we just get an error all
264:08 - right very simple
264:11 - and now we just need to go to our
264:13 - handle submit guy right on submit guy
264:15 - right there and change all of this
264:18 - with simply on
264:20 - sign up
264:22 - i want you to do values.email and
264:24 - values.password
264:27 - okay
264:29 - pretty simple
264:32 - sign up
264:34 - yep perfect everything everything else
264:36 - is looking good to me
264:38 - so let's go to our sign up page and
264:40 - let's see if it works so let's let's
264:42 - uh hit sign up
264:45 - and let's go here and i will do causey
264:47 - plus one at cleverprogrammer.com
264:52 - and i'll actually show you the user
264:54 - being added in real time because i think
264:56 - it'll be fun to see that so just take
264:58 - keep looking right over here on the left
264:59 - hand side you'll see quasi plus one
265:01 - being a user gets created so go clever
265:04 - quasi one
265:05 - and then password is going to one two
265:07 - four five six i'll hit sign up
265:13 - oh
265:14 - error of course so let's figure out what
265:16 - the error is
265:18 - hold on the user oh no no no no no i'm
265:20 - wrong i'm wrong it did work this page
265:22 - just doesn't refresh
265:24 - um on the fly so i actually have to hit
265:27 - refresh then it should work
265:30 - there we go
265:31 - i love how firebase is not using their
265:34 - on snapshot listener come on guys use
265:36 - your own stuff
265:40 - so there we go and now kazi plus one at
265:43 - cleverprogrammer.com is showing up i
265:44 - just created this user
265:52 - okay perfect so our sign up guys works
265:55 - how freaking awesome is that or sign up
265:58 - is working
266:00 - or sign out
266:02 - or we have we don't have sign out yet
266:03 - but our sign up and our log in
266:06 - are both working so we can create a user
266:08 - and we can log in with an existing user
266:10 - so that's beautiful
266:14 - james morgan asks what extension to use
266:16 - for those slick autocompletes that you
266:18 - do like with the firebase function just
266:20 - now
266:21 - that is github co-pilot like the crazy
266:23 - stuff that you guys see auto-completing
266:25 - on my screen that's just ridiculous
266:26 - that's like what the hell
266:28 - it's not because i had already typed in
266:30 - the line of code in this project i had
266:32 - never written that line of code in this
266:34 - project
266:35 - how it's actually being autocompleted is
266:36 - because of github copilot is ridiculous
266:39 - it has access to millions of lines of
266:41 - code millions of coding projects
266:44 - actually
266:46 - and it's pulling the data from there and
266:48 - using that to
266:49 - predict what you're going to be writing
266:51 - next most of times it's very accurate
266:52 - it's it's
266:54 - it's my favorite extension
266:56 - and i highly recommend everybody gets
266:58 - that it's literally the best extension
267:04 - cool
267:05 - so
267:06 - let's now move past this
267:10 - and now we're gonna add the new user to
267:12 - the firestore
267:21 - yeah
267:23 - so yeah we can do that it's very easy
267:29 - all right let's go to firebase now
267:31 - firebase.js that we created and uh we're
267:33 - gonna do cons db is equal to
267:36 - firebase.firestore
267:40 - all right and now instead of doing
267:42 - default exports we're just going to do
267:43 - firebase and like that
267:46 - let's go back to signup form
267:49 - and
267:50 - let's actually go to login screen as
267:51 - well
267:52 - not a login screen i mean login form
267:55 - and since it's a named export you guys
267:58 - have to put in these squigglies like
267:59 - this let's go to sign up
268:01 - and let's also put this in squigglies
268:04 - like this
268:05 - but now what we need is we need access
268:06 - to database
268:08 - okay
268:09 - and here's what we're gonna do
268:13 - whenever a new user signs up here's what
268:16 - i want to have happen
268:18 - so i just created a function it's called
268:20 - get random profile picture and what this
268:22 - function does asynchronous it goes to
268:24 - this api
268:26 - and it just gets a random user okay so
268:30 - let me actually just um
268:35 - let me move this like that
268:39 - all right so now it'll be easy for me to
268:41 - show you guys whenever i want to show
268:42 - you guys something
268:45 - all right so this random user api is
268:47 - basically this so if i hit enter
268:50 - if you go here every time it just gives
268:52 - you a random user so i'll refresh again
268:54 - and watch i got miss darcy corn
268:57 - refresh
268:59 - right i'll zoom in so it's very very
269:01 - easy to see this
269:02 - let's refresh
269:04 - so every time i'll get a different user
269:06 - when i refresh this right that's the
269:07 - point of random user i'm using random
269:09 - user to get people's uh
269:13 - to get people's um
269:16 - to just get a random profile photo for
269:19 - everybody that signs up that's it okay
269:21 - it's just a little hack for getting
269:23 - random photos for everybody signs up get
269:25 - the data as a response and as a json
269:27 - response and then uh just get the large
269:30 - picture okay
269:39 - cool and then on sign up here's what
269:41 - we're gonna do we're gonna do
269:45 - this is going to be const auth user
269:48 - it's going to be await blah blah blah
269:51 - all right
269:54 - and now i'm going to use this user okay
269:58 - so let's go here and i'm going to say
270:01 - db.collection
270:02 - users
270:05 - dot add
270:11 - owner uid is going to be auth
270:13 - user.user.uid
270:23 - okay you got username is going to be
270:26 - whatever the username
270:28 - um
270:33 - username
270:36 - david this doesn't look right
270:41 - we don't have access to username here so
270:43 - this should actually not just be
270:45 - username
270:46 - oh no no we're passing in the username
270:48 - from okay okay got it got it got it got
270:50 - it got it got it got it
270:52 - so basically on this sub uh here guys we
270:54 - need to actually do email password and
270:56 - values.username like this
270:59 - like that okay
271:01 - and then this function should take in a
271:03 - username as well
271:05 - and now that username is being passed in
271:11 - uh email is gonna be authuser.user.email
271:17 - and then profile picture
271:19 - we're just gonna say await get random
271:21 - profile picture
271:29 - there we go
271:30 - so what this is going to do is when the
271:32 - user signs up it will add them to our
271:34 - own collection so not just this right
271:36 - here but in our own firebase database
271:40 - it's going to create a collection called
271:41 - users going to add them in there okay so
271:43 - for example now if we go and sign up
271:45 - watch what happens so i'll sign up as
271:47 - um quasi plus two
271:52 - and let's go clever quasi 2 here and
271:54 - i'll hit sign up
271:56 - and it just worked and let's go here
272:00 - it didn't add it to the database
272:01 - interesting
272:04 - oh i did it did i just have to refresh
272:06 - it
272:08 - um so i have a user's collection inside
272:11 - of it i have a user and that user has
272:13 - the following email owner id profile
272:15 - picture and password so if i look at the
272:17 - profile picture now
272:20 - it's this right here so i'm apparently
272:22 - her so this is
272:24 - this this instagram should be called
272:27 - catfish instagram
272:30 - all right
272:32 - that's what this instagram should be
272:33 - called
272:35 - catfishing instagram clone
272:38 - all right so now new user is being
272:40 - created new user when they get created
272:43 - as assigned something random
272:45 - automatically very nice
272:49 - uh arthur says would love to try copilot
272:51 - but i'm way too accommodated with
272:53 - sublime and there's no support for it
272:54 - bro i'm sorry but you're gonna have to
272:56 - just give up on sublime like
272:58 - sublime is
273:00 - it's it's nothing compared to where vs
273:02 - code is at you can have everything that
273:04 - some lime has but way better
273:07 - so i would i would recommend to try to
273:09 - move
273:12 - try making the move
273:14 - penelope says wow now that's really
273:16 - awesome dope
273:20 - all right let's keep rocking and rolling
273:22 - you guys we're making really really good
273:24 - progress let's keep going
273:27 - okay
273:28 - now let's add in firebase auth and
273:30 - navigation
273:33 - so what this means is uh here's what it
273:36 - means
273:37 - we wanna be able to
273:42 - this one is gonna be a really cool one
273:45 - okay and what we want to do is we want
273:47 - to wrap the entire app in navigation
273:49 - okay and i'll show you how we do that
273:52 - so let's go to navigation
273:55 - because right now right i can go as the
273:58 - user i can go anywhere so like watch
273:59 - this i'm currently not logged in but i
274:02 - can if i just change the route here to
274:04 - like home screen or something
274:06 - i'll be allowed to go there if i refresh
274:10 - so currently the app is not protected so
274:12 - we basically need to do something like
274:16 - almost imagine if i could do this like
274:18 - if user is logged in
274:21 - then they have access to
274:24 - so if the user is logged in right
274:26 - then they have access to
274:29 - home screen and new post screen
274:32 - okay and then what i want to do is if
274:35 - user is not logged in
274:39 - damn they should have access to what
274:40 - screens guys
274:42 - clearly cannot have access to any of
274:43 - these right
274:44 - so then they in that case
274:47 - user is not logged in
274:48 - they should have actually access to
274:50 - these bottom login and sign up screen
274:54 - all right
274:57 - so these two are the login logged in
274:59 - screens
275:01 - and then these two are the logged out
275:03 - screens or the signed out screens
275:06 - so let's build two separate stacks that
275:08 - resemble that
275:15 - so this is a signed in stack and now
275:17 - we're gonna do con we're gonna do
275:20 - uh export const signed
275:23 - out stack
275:31 - okay we're still gonna need to do this
275:33 - navigation and stuff like that but
275:35 - here's the difference okay so signed out
275:37 - stock by default we'll have you on the
275:39 - login screen
275:42 - and it also won't have access to
275:46 - home screen and login screen so if
275:48 - you're logged out you literally will
275:50 - have a stack that doesn't even have
275:51 - access to those screens
275:52 - so this is a very safe way of doing it
276:00 - okay
276:02 - and from the signed in stack we're going
276:04 - to remove the login screen
276:07 - all right dope so we got two different
276:10 - stacks now
276:13 - signed in stack signed out stack signed
276:15 - in has two screens and signed out has
276:18 - two screens here okay i'm gonna remove
276:21 - this export default line here and we're
276:23 - just gonna do
276:24 - export
276:26 - consigned and stack
276:31 - okay now we're gonna create a new file
276:34 - it'll be called auth navigation.js
276:41 - all right and uh this is what's gonna
276:43 - happen in here so
276:47 - oh sorry let's capitalize the auth
276:50 - so let's rename it and let's capitalize
276:52 - the a here
276:54 - and uh let's right click here rename
276:57 - symbol and let's go auth navigation
277:03 - okay
277:05 - and we're gonna do const
277:07 - current
277:09 - let's actually start it off like this
277:11 - okay
277:18 - so i'm gonna do return and it's gonna
277:20 - return the following
277:23 - so watch how i'm gonna do this is gonna
277:24 - be really nice so we're gonna basically
277:26 - say if current user
277:30 - is basically logged in
277:33 - then i want you to give me the signed in
277:35 - stack
277:40 - otherwise give me the
277:42 - signed
277:46 - signed
277:47 - out stack
277:53 - let's import so i imported signed in
277:55 - stack and signed out stack okay
277:59 - let's go to um
278:01 - app.js and what we want to do within
278:03 - app.js
278:04 - is we want to basically say auth
278:07 - navigation
278:11 - and that's all we need okay so now auth
278:14 - navigation is our main thing which is
278:16 - going to dynamically determine which
278:18 - stack you see
278:20 - now in here we want to do a few things
278:21 - so we're going to go we want to use a
278:23 - use effect hook
278:32 - all right
278:34 - and inside of this use effect hook
278:38 - basically what i'm going to say is i'm
278:39 - going to say
278:42 - firebase.auth
278:44 - that on auth
278:46 - state changed
278:56 - user is
279:01 - user okay
279:02 - and now we're gonna create so now here's
279:04 - a cool thing so
279:06 - you guys might have seen where you guys
279:07 - do like const unsubscribe
279:11 - equals and then you have to do like
279:13 - return unsubscribe
279:15 - um i'll show you guys a cool hack
279:18 - so
279:19 - all you have to do is just return this
279:21 - so you can also just do this
279:23 - um but what also you could do is you
279:25 - could just
279:26 - remove the squiggly and you should be
279:28 - good now
279:29 - because it's an implicit return here
279:33 - okay
279:37 - um it shouldn't be use gesture handler
279:39 - it should be user handler and we're
279:41 - going to make this function
279:46 - so right in here we're going to say
279:48 - const current
279:50 - user set current user
279:54 - use state is null
279:58 - all right and then we're going to create
279:59 - a user handler and what this is going to
280:01 - do is when you give it a user
280:06 - it's going to check if that user exists
280:09 - and if it does it's going to just set
280:10 - that user otherwise going to set the
280:12 - user to null
280:15 - and um
280:16 - that's essentially it
280:20 - all right so now this will wrap your
280:22 - entire app up so on austin changed is a
280:25 - listener which will never stop listening
280:28 - we're listening at the global level
280:30 - where the entire app is so for example
280:33 - it's kind of like what we're doing is um
280:37 - here's our app
280:40 - app
280:43 - and then our firebase listener is like
280:45 - right here
280:47 - sandwiching that app
280:50 - okay
280:51 - so
280:52 - that's our
280:53 - firebase listener
280:56 - and it's always listening at the global
280:58 - level
280:59 - and if it sees
281:02 - so let me make another visual right
281:04 - there
281:06 - so basically this is the signed
281:09 - out stack and the other one is let's
281:11 - just call it the app stack or the signed
281:13 - in stack
281:14 - so this will handle it so if you're
281:16 - logged in it'll send you here if you're
281:19 - logged out it will send you here
281:23 - yes
281:27 - says thank you for so many hacks i'm
281:29 - noting everything from the start
281:32 - you got it
281:37 - cool
281:46 - all right here we go
281:49 - so everything is gucci or not stay
281:51 - changed
281:52 - i'll pass in the user it'll send it to
281:54 - the user handler the user handler just
281:56 - does if the user exists it sets it
281:58 - otherwise it doesn't
282:00 - so
282:01 - um this should be good now guys honestly
282:05 - the entire app is wrapped up inside of
282:07 - it
282:12 - so like let's refresh and let's see what
282:14 - happens
282:16 - a current user is giving a problem why
282:18 - is that
282:19 - uh
282:20 - okay i have weird imports happening so
282:23 - so i do use state
282:25 - doesn't know this
282:30 - current user is still
282:32 - um
282:34 - okay that's not true it should be able
282:35 - to find current user
282:44 - that's weird
282:56 - why can't define current user current
282:58 - user is right there
283:09 - huh
283:13 - fresh
283:14 - i'm just gonna shut off the app and
283:16 - start it again
283:19 - like i would get if the error said
283:21 - something else but like it's saying
283:23 - can't find variable
283:25 - the variable is right there
283:35 - okay that's a better error
283:38 - so it's saying that auth navigation
283:41 - lowercase does not exist so we're going
283:43 - to make this a capital auth navigation
283:47 - let's refresh now
283:52 - uh can't find variable use effect better
283:55 - error much better error
283:57 - because we're not importing it
284:01 - effect
284:03 - can't find firebase another good error
284:06 - so let's go import firebase from
284:11 - firebase
284:23 - okay now it's freaking out about
284:28 - yeah yeah yeah it's a named export now
284:30 - so i have to do it like this
284:33 - there we go so it's detecting that i'm
284:35 - logged in you guys and it's serving me
284:37 - the signed in stack
284:39 - that's what it's doing
284:43 - this is exactly what we want now we want
284:45 - to add the ability to sign out so we can
284:47 - actually see this in action so i'm going
284:49 - to go to
284:51 - header dot js
284:55 - uh and inside of header we're going to
284:57 - import firebase we're going to do
284:59 - firebase
285:01 - from
285:03 - firebase
285:05 - uh this header is this guy right here
285:07 - guys
285:08 - and i'm just trying to make that uh
285:09 - instagram button become a log out button
285:18 - so we're gonna create a function
285:22 - that that i'm just gonna put right here
285:25 - at the top here and we're just gonna say
285:26 - const
285:28 - handle sign out
285:33 - um and we're gonna say
285:35 - firebase
285:36 - dot
285:38 - dot sign out
285:40 - dot then
285:42 - and
285:57 - yeah
285:58 - i mean we could also do um
286:00 - a weight and try catch this so
286:04 - you could do it like async
286:06 - if we want to be consistent with
286:08 - everything that we were doing
286:17 - so we could wrap this in a try catch
286:21 - try catch
286:26 - there we go
286:54 - there we go so we got handle sign out
286:57 - try this
286:58 - uh and if it works then we'll just go
287:00 - console.log
287:02 - signed
287:05 - out successfully
287:08 - all right
287:13 - seems pretty straightforward right
287:15 - otherwise show the error that happened
287:18 - and now this handle sign out we just
287:21 - want to give it right here so we're
287:22 - going to say on press
287:25 - we can just say handle sign out
287:29 - cool
287:30 - and now let's refresh
287:32 - and um i'll click instagram logo and it
287:35 - should sign me out there we go guys it
287:37 - just signed us out
287:39 - hey
287:40 - nice so we got sign in and sign out
287:43 - functionality
287:44 - uh working completely normally
287:51 - there we go so we just signed in so
287:53 - there you go guys our login and user
287:56 - authentication is getting pretty on
287:59 - freaking point all right that's exactly
288:02 - what we wanted
288:06 - now another thing that we want to do
288:07 - guys is we want to make some firebase
288:10 - rules
288:11 - and basically with these firebase rules
288:14 - we're going to do is this so let's go
288:15 - here
288:16 - let's go to rules
288:19 - and here's what we want to do okay so
288:21 - i'll paste these rules right here i
288:22 - don't want to go too much into the rules
288:24 - but all that's happening is this
288:28 - i'm creating a function which is called
288:30 - uh
288:33 - a user is authenticated and it just
288:36 - returns uh this so if the user is
288:38 - authenticated
288:40 - it it just checks that the user is
288:42 - authenticated if they are not it will
288:44 - return false
288:46 - if the user is authenticated it will
288:47 - return true so think about it like it's
288:50 - just a true or false
288:53 - all right
288:55 - uh and there's a playground here too
288:57 - which is pretty cool so like if i go
288:59 - playground
289:00 - you'll be able to like
289:02 - get specific resources right so for
289:04 - example i can go
289:05 - get me all the users document and i hit
289:08 - run
289:09 - and it tells me like why it didn't work
289:12 - it says
289:13 - um because i'm not authenticated so it
289:16 - did not work see authentication is false
289:19 - but if i go here and i click
289:20 - authenticate hid
289:23 - and instead of a google we do password
289:26 - and i hit run
289:28 - now but look at that it actually says
289:30 - that i'm actually authenticated so this
289:33 - is
289:33 - looking through the user's collection
289:36 - inside of your database
289:38 - that's exactly what you want then later
289:40 - you want to be able to also test posts
289:42 - like this too
289:44 - all right
289:45 - so these rules work
289:48 - and now because they work i'm going to
289:49 - publish them
289:54 - beautiful
290:01 - i just read your message david
290:05 - so that was just a little bit behind the
290:06 - scenes of how
290:08 - some extra firebase rules and ninja
290:10 - skills that you guys
290:12 - um
290:13 - can acquire okay
290:15 - now we need to be reading these posts
290:17 - from the home screen so let's go to the
290:19 - home screen and let's let's let's read
290:21 - these posts now
290:22 - and we're going to read these posts kind
290:24 - of right at the top here and i'm just
290:26 - going to wrap in the use effect hook
290:28 - and i will simply say this
290:38 - okay and we're gonna do db.collection
290:41 - group
290:43 - hosts
290:46 - dot on snapshot
290:50 - there
290:52 - okay and uh
290:55 - only run as soon as the thing starts and
290:58 - then that's it don't run any more times
291:01 - okay
291:02 - so this collection group thing
291:04 - uh let's import use effect by the way
291:09 - okay and we also need access to
291:12 - db so let's go import
291:15 - db
291:18 - from
291:25 - firebase
291:27 - okay now you might be wondering what is
291:29 - this collection group thing so here's
291:30 - what i want you guys to understand okay
291:33 - [Music]
291:34 - uh boris lazarevsky says great and
291:37 - amazing work hats off thank you so much
291:39 - i really appreciate it it means a lot
291:41 - seriously thank you
291:44 - james short says amazing clone to watch
291:46 - thank you guys these comments are so
291:48 - freaking helpful it just keeps you going
291:49 - right because we're already going for
291:51 - what four
291:52 - almost five hours now and we're still
291:54 - going strong and it's this energy that
291:57 - keeps us up so thank you guys
292:00 - now collection group what's actually
292:02 - happening here with this collection
292:03 - stuff is i'll show you
292:09 - so post is not going to be a thing on
292:11 - its own post is going to be a sub
292:12 - collection of users because remember
292:15 - only users can have posts
292:18 - not the other way around
292:19 - so
292:21 - um what we're going to have is going to
292:24 - look like this
292:27 - like that
292:28 - all right
292:29 - so one specific user
292:32 - like causeyplus2a cleverprogrammer.com
292:35 - is one specific user
292:37 - that is going to have a collection of
292:39 - posts that he is the owner of
292:44 - all right
292:45 - and then these posts are going to have
292:47 - things like you know caption
292:50 - and uh hello
292:55 - uh
292:56 - crushing the build
292:58 - let's go
293:01 - there we go okay and i'll hit add
293:04 - uh they'll have other things like
293:07 - i mean actually let's just look at the
293:08 - data structure that we have for our fake
293:10 - post database that we made earlier so
293:12 - let's go to data let's go to posts
293:15 - and it's gonna have image url a user
293:17 - right it's gonna have uh
293:20 - image url as well so
293:22 - that'll look like this
293:25 - image url
293:28 - that'll look like this
293:31 - okay
293:33 - it'll have a user
293:36 - right and who's the user it'll have like
293:38 - the email of the user for example so
293:41 - there's a bunch of stuff that's going to
293:42 - be in there and i'll show you guys how
293:44 - we're going to be doing this but
293:45 - overall the data structure is users it
293:48 - has sub-collection of posts and
293:51 - what if you have multiple users right so
293:54 - for example
293:56 - let's say i have another user here
293:59 - whose email is causi clever
294:02 - programmer.com
294:10 - right and
294:11 - that user is going to have his own posts
294:14 - so how do we show all of the posts
294:17 - within every sub collection
294:19 - okay and david you should actually make
294:21 - this a clip as well how to uh show sub
294:24 - collection you know
294:26 - and so it's like how do i loop through
294:28 - and get every single post well instead
294:30 - of doing it like i'm going to go inside
294:32 - of this and i'm going to go inside of
294:33 - this and i'm going to go inside of post
294:36 - you don't do it like that you just do a
294:38 - collection group
294:40 - and firebase itself knows how to go
294:42 - inside of each single user and get all
294:44 - of their posts and then give it to you
294:46 - so the
294:48 - hack
294:49 - that we're gonna do is
294:51 - collection group that's the freaking
294:54 - nice thing
294:55 - okay that's how we do it
294:59 - cool there we go so dog collection dog
295:02 - groups
295:03 - um
295:06 - and then just read me the data and show
295:08 - it out loud and guys take a look at this
295:10 - i'm already getting all the posts
295:13 - like literally we just made this post
295:15 - and i'm already getting it right
295:16 - crushing the bill let's go
295:18 - if i update this right now it'll update
295:20 - too so for example
295:23 - we'll make post collection for this user
295:25 - as well we'll do posts
295:28 - right and we will say
295:31 - caption is
295:33 - post 2 from different
295:35 - user
295:38 - an image url is
295:40 - i don't know whatever this
295:44 - so now the second user has posts as well
295:46 - and now let's see if they're being read
295:48 - look at that
295:49 - posts from uh post 2 from different user
295:53 - look right crushing the bill let's go
295:56 - so that's very very nice right it's
295:59 - already working
296:03 - okay great it seems like we're already
296:05 - able to read the
296:07 - data
296:08 - it's very very good
296:11 - now let's go back to the sign up and i
296:13 - just want to change something with the
296:15 - sign up
296:16 - so here instead of dot add
296:19 - what i actually want to do
296:21 - is i'm going to do dot set
296:24 - and i'm going to do doc
296:26 - okay and for doc i'm going to give it
296:29 - auth user.user.email
296:32 - so all that means is instead of these
296:34 - users having these random ids their uh
296:38 - their or document ids their document id
296:41 - is going to be their email because i'm
296:42 - assuming everybody can only have one
296:44 - email right that's safe to assume
296:51 - cool so this will
296:53 - this is when you want to yourself
296:56 - generate a document id
296:59 - and this will make things easier for us
297:01 - later on we'll just be able to say get
297:02 - me the user with this email and they'll
297:04 - know who we're talking about
297:09 - initial values here we go on submit
297:14 - all right that's all good it's all good
297:16 - right there
297:18 - okay
297:19 - that should be good
297:24 - so like let's just test it and let's uh
297:27 - yo fidel sahir says i just joined now
297:30 - this is awesome let's go yo welcome
297:32 - welcome welcome glad to have you here
297:34 - let's sign out let's create a new user
297:38 - and we'll go cozy
297:40 - plus two at clever or actually let's go
297:42 - plus three
297:48 - we'll go clever quasi three and password
297:52 - one two five six
297:53 - i'll sign up
297:56 - all right and notice that we just got a
297:58 - new user with the doc id that we gave it
298:01 - okay other than that nothing changed so
298:04 - that whenever you want to assign your
298:05 - own doc ids just use
298:08 - doc and then dot set it's really nice
298:23 - all right now we're going to be able to
298:24 - add new posts to the user this is where
298:26 - like the back end stuff is going to
298:28 - become heavy i'm going to try to go
298:29 - through it a little bit fast
298:31 - uh
298:33 - and i hope that you guys will be able to
298:35 - keep up with me okay or i'll i mean uh
298:38 - you guys will
298:39 - i believe in you guys
298:41 - let's go to formic post uploader so now
298:43 - we want to be able to actually upload
298:44 - the post that we made
298:48 - let's go use effect
298:54 - and we're also going to need to import
298:56 - database here
298:58 - and firebase from
299:02 - firebase
299:05 - yeah
299:09 - [Music]
299:11 - and now we want to be able to do the
299:12 - following
299:14 - okay
299:15 - so we're going to set the we're going to
299:17 - have a current logged in user and we're
299:18 - going to set the current logged in user
299:26 - and i'm gonna get the username in just a
299:29 - second okay i'll show you how i'm gonna
299:31 - do that
299:32 - so we're gonna do uh
299:35 - const
299:36 - uh
299:39 - get user name
299:54 - whoa
300:05 - um
300:17 - all right so let's do it like this
300:20 - going full on nas mode right now
300:23 - const user
300:25 - [Laughter]
300:32 - we already have the db so i don't need
300:34 - to get the db
300:37 - [Music]
300:41 - const
300:42 - unsubscribe unsubscribe
300:46 - db.collection
300:52 - this does not look right to me
300:55 - db.dock
300:58 - this is a bad way of doing it david we
301:00 - should do it like
301:02 - is there a db.doc
301:05 - whatever that's fine so this is a
301:06 - hideous way of doing it guys don't do it
301:08 - like this just get the specific document
301:10 - you're looking for
301:11 - um but basically this is what i'm
301:13 - talking about david i'll show you the
301:14 - code in slack so take a look at this
301:16 - right
301:18 - so this is like really stupid code
301:20 - because you should just be able to give
301:21 - like the specific doc id and get your
301:23 - specific user
301:26 - see if you can convert it into that and
301:27 - send it over
301:29 - because it'll be much nicer for
301:31 - everybody to view that than what i'm
301:33 - about the the
301:34 - gibberish that i'm about to show
301:36 - everybody
301:38 - it's not that i mean this is this is a
301:40 - way
301:56 - uh no david i i just mean like look i'm
301:59 - getting one user here and i'm getting
302:02 - just that user's username
302:04 - um
302:06 - okay that's fine that's fine that's okay
302:08 - david i'll figure it out
302:11 - where's david david is on
302:13 - uh sitting on skype with me
302:15 - he's just not like right there so like i
302:18 - can show you guys david here's david
302:21 - look
302:23 - say hi david
302:26 - there we go all right we're going to
302:27 - send him back
302:28 - to where he came from
302:30 - what's up boy
302:32 - he just said what's up
302:34 - [Music]
302:35 - we're going to send him back to his
302:37 - hungarian cave
302:44 - where owner id
302:48 - is equal to
302:50 - user.uid
302:54 - okay
302:57 - this is
302:59 - i'm so sorry guys this is terrible it's
303:01 - such a complicated
303:02 - way of getting your username there's
303:04 - much better way of doing this
303:06 - i hope david figures it out for us but
303:09 - seems like he's lost right now
303:13 - uh on snapshot
303:16 - snapshot
303:18 - oh my god this is it's like
303:20 - overkill but it's okay that's what works
303:23 - your challenge will be to figure out how
303:25 - to make it less uh clunky
303:28 - all right like that
303:38 - uh where am i closing what's happening
303:40 - here
303:48 - there we go it's like complaining okay
303:51 - set current logged in user to
303:54 - user name is going to be
303:56 - doc.data.username
304:00 - and then profile picture
304:05 - dog.data.profile picture
304:10 - people are laughing well david is in the
304:12 - back end
304:13 - david
304:17 - yeah david is in the back end that's
304:19 - right
304:21 - david is the back end
304:26 - all right this should get us the
304:27 - username and then at the end of all of
304:29 - this guys we're just going to return
304:31 - unsubscribe
304:33 - all right there we go
304:37 - okay we'll do a use effect hook
304:45 - okay that'll get the username
304:48 - this is just like to get the username of
304:50 - the person
304:52 - who's logged in right now
305:06 - [Music]
305:07 - all right and now upload post to
305:10 - firebase
305:12 - right so this is now gonna be the
305:14 - interesting part
305:15 - and uh here's what we're gonna do for
305:17 - this we're just gonna say uh
305:20 - unsubscribe
305:22 - subscribe
305:26 - okay
305:30 - db.collection
305:32 - and we're gonna say get me users
305:35 - and then we're gonna go get the dock
305:45 - firebase
305:47 - dot auth
305:49 - dot current user dot email
305:59 - [Music]
306:01 - beautiful
306:06 - dot collection
306:08 - posts and then we're gonna add the new
306:11 - post okay so here we're gonna go dot add
306:14 - and then we're gonna give it the post
306:16 - object
306:17 - it's gonna be a bunch of things i'll
306:18 - just
306:19 - write it over here so you guys can see
306:21 - it but here's what we're doing to add
306:24 - the post
306:26 - get the current user this will get the
306:28 - current user
306:32 - okay
306:35 - get the collections of that user they
306:37 - get the posts of that user so for
306:39 - example this will get quasi
306:42 - okay
306:44 - for example
306:46 - users give it the email this will get me
306:48 - quasi and all the document inside here
306:51 - okay
306:52 - and then
306:54 - when we do dot collection posts
306:57 - is going to get us the children
306:59 - the posts
307:01 - that cause he has if i go here this
307:03 - collection right there
307:06 - okay
307:08 - and then we're going to add the post and
307:11 - here's what the post is going to take
307:12 - the post is going to take an image
307:15 - it's going to take in the current logged
307:17 - in user's username is going to take in
307:19 - the profile picture of the current login
307:20 - user style profile picture
307:24 - it's going to take in the id of who the
307:26 - owner of this post is
307:35 - yes
307:36 - caption created at and it's gonna put a
307:38 - timestamp for when it was created and
307:40 - since it's a brand new post it's
307:41 - obviously going to have zero likes
307:44 - okay and the data structure that we're
307:46 - choosing to use that's going to be the
307:48 - interesting thing so likes by users will
307:50 - store every user's unique email
307:54 - and then to get how many likes we have
307:56 - we just count the length of that array
307:59 - and we're good
308:02 - all right that's how we're going to do
308:03 - it
308:04 - and after all of this is done
308:07 - we want to chain it with
308:09 - once this is successfully done i want
308:12 - you to just go back
308:14 - so basically go back to the home screen
308:17 - okay
308:20 - now we are going to need access to
308:22 - navigation i believe
308:24 - but formic post uploader already has
308:27 - access to it so that's good
308:47 - okay cool
308:50 - so we're getting the username we're
308:51 - adding the post to the database to the
308:53 - database
308:55 - and now let's go
308:57 - here we're going to remove all of this
309:00 - and we're just going to say upload post
309:03 - to firebase just like this
309:05 - and we're going to give it values
309:08 - image url and values now caption those
309:11 - are the two things
309:13 - and upload
309:15 - knows what to do with it
309:17 - and uh then simply we're gonna return
309:20 - unsubscribe
309:25 - okay
309:27 - who said just breathe
309:30 - just breathe
309:42 - who's there
309:44 - actually thank you that's a good
309:46 - reminder
309:48 - quasi gaming yes please stop spamming or
309:51 - you will be spammed from this account
309:59 - all right so this looks good to me
310:01 - honestly
310:02 - uh if this looks good to you guys then
310:04 - we should be good to go so let's try
310:06 - adding a post and let's see if it
310:07 - actually adds it

311:46 - bit and just seeing what it does and so
311:48 - far i'm liking it
311:52 - so i'm gonna keep it that way
312:00 - all right now uh we're adding the stuff
312:02 - to the database now but what we a little
312:05 - what we do need to do is read this info
312:07 - from the database you guys so let's go
312:09 - ahead and do that now let's pull the
312:11 - posts
312:12 - from the database
312:20 - all right so we're gonna
312:22 - uh import use state here on the home
312:24 - screen state
312:26 - okay and uh here's what we're gonna do
312:29 - you guys
312:32 - what is it complaining about
312:35 - can't find variable use effect ah there
312:38 - we go
312:41 - hydrate
312:42 - what is happening you guys am i thirsty
312:45 - am i tired people are telling me i need
312:46 - to drink coffee i need to drink water

312:55 - i mean i'll hydrate thank you
313:09 - jesus all right i will drink i'm sorry
313:13 - so here's what we want to do look at how
313:15 - easy
313:17 - easy this transition is going to be you
313:20 - guys
313:21 - this pose is already an array of objects
313:24 - which looks exactly like our firebase
313:27 - structure
313:29 - once we replace
313:30 - this variable post here with our
313:32 - firebase posts
313:33 - everything will work like freaking
313:37 - magic
313:39 - that's gonna be very very nice you guys
313:41 - it's gonna be very nice
313:44 - so let's go ahead and uh
313:46 - work on that okay we're gonna do const
313:49 - posts
313:50 - set posts i'm gonna go use state and
313:53 - it's gonna be an empty array because in
313:55 - the start
313:57 - i want you to start off with an empty
313:58 - array okay
314:02 - and now instead of console logging this
314:05 - bad boy right here instead guys here's
314:09 - what we're gonna do
314:11 - we're gonna go
314:13 - set post
314:15 - done
314:16 - that's it
314:17 - that's freaking it
314:19 - and the last bit change this post from
314:22 - capital post to
314:24 - tiny post just like that
314:26 - and we should have everything uh
314:29 - breaking so that's great you guys
314:32 - undefined is not an object
314:34 - so let's go to where we did this let's
314:37 - go to posts
314:40 - not posts my bad let's go to post.js
314:43 - let's go to line what is it saying 121
314:47 - let's go to line 121
314:49 - and
314:51 - i'm just going to hit a question mark
314:52 - right there
314:57 - and let's put a question mark right
314:59 - there
315:09 - i mean if i don't have posts it
315:10 - shouldn't even like go any deeper to be
315:12 - honest
315:22 - hold on post our comments is not
315:25 - what
315:34 - okay how about this
315:37 - i'm going to remove this set post from
315:39 - here and let's just see what happens
315:40 - what happens if i give you an empty
315:41 - array if i give you an empty array it
315:44 - seems like my code works fine
315:55 - undefined is not an object evaluating
315:57 - posts dot likes dot to local
316:02 - okay
316:04 - now we're getting a different type of
316:06 - error
316:11 - pause the comments that map
316:13 - i'm just gonna start putting in question
316:15 - marks
316:17 - everywhere
316:19 - and uh hopefully something should fix it
316:21 - and david maybe i could use your help
316:23 - here
316:24 - just to just like a little uh bug that i
316:27 - don't think is like that important to
316:29 - solve

316:37 - oh because some of the
316:39 - okay okay got it got it because some

316:54 - just like delete posts that's what's
316:55 - causing the error no duh because it

318:25 - other things guys i didn't i did not
318:27 - explain
318:29 - that i probably should have explained a
318:31 - little bit better
318:32 - is if i go into rules
318:34 - just just know that these rules
318:36 - basically say the following
318:41 - if i'm trying to write to the user's
318:44 - collection i must be authenticated and
318:48 - logged in if i'm not authenticated or
318:50 - logged in i should not be able to read
318:52 - or write to the user's collection
318:56 - this rule over here
318:58 - says
319:00 - to the sub collection posts
319:04 - i should not be able
319:06 - to read or write
319:08 - unless
319:10 - i am
319:12 - authenticated
319:14 - all right
319:15 - so even if somehow you got to be able to
319:17 - make a post you cannot make it if you're
319:19 - not logged in all right this is just
319:21 - like extra layers of security
319:29 - yeah i like the style guys i'm not gonna
319:31 - change it i actually enjoy coding in
319:33 - this it's fun for me
319:36 - uh q a will be at the end so i got you
319:39 - with that don't worry
319:41 - all right so now my posts are showing up
319:43 - david if you want to make some posts
319:46 - um
319:47 - that would be cool from firebase you can
319:49 - make them or you can make a new user and
319:51 - make po wait do you have access to my
319:53 - stuff oh i'll have to tunnel no i don't
319:55 - have to tunnel it you can see it right
319:57 - you're already here
320:00 - so you can make them from firebase
320:03 - or from here whatever you want make them
320:06 - from here because then you'll have
320:07 - actual user
320:10 - so up to you
320:12 - hey what are you doing
320:14 - breaking my code
320:17 - read and write access
320:19 - uh you don't need don't know forget
320:20 - about forget about firebase david
320:25 - just make posts
320:26 - from here oh but you won't be able to
320:28 - see anything never mind it's all good
320:30 - we're fine we're fine
320:37 - all right let's go to formic post
320:39 - uploader you guys and one thing we do
320:41 - want to change which can be which we can
320:43 - cause bugs later
320:44 - let's go to formic post uploader and for
320:47 - user here we're going to say user name
320:49 - instead of user
320:50 - all right
320:55 - just to be consistent with how we had
320:56 - everything
321:09 - um is that actually necessary i'm sorry
321:11 - actually i don't think it's necessary
321:13 - right now so i'm not going to tell you
321:14 - guys to do that because it might throw
321:16 - you off later okay so just um
321:19 - just leave it as user because you're
321:21 - gonna have to change it in multiple
321:22 - other places and i think for now we're
321:24 - fine
321:26 - so now let's go to our stories component
321:27 - guys we're almost coming to the end
321:29 - right like look at how much
321:30 - functionality we've already added into
321:32 - this like it's crazy we can log in we
321:36 - can log out
321:37 - we have a home screen we can create a
321:39 - new post at the bottom tabs working i
321:42 - mean this is a huge application right
321:44 - now
321:48 - let's just fix this bug in uh stories
321:51 - so
321:52 - instead of
321:54 - slice of 10 let's give a style
321:56 - what what what is this bug i'm talking
321:58 - about like look at the difference
321:59 - between chickasha and nasdamanski they
322:01 - have a big gap
322:02 - whereas me and my brother's post have
322:04 - like a small gap so i'm just gonna
322:06 - give it a six here
322:09 - and then margin left we're going to
322:11 - increase it to like 18.
322:16 - there we go so now that looks more like
322:18 - regular stories
322:21 - so that should fix the air
322:23 - beautiful
322:31 - all right guys now what we want to be
322:33 - able to do is we want to be able to like
322:36 - and unlike posts
322:38 - um and then after that i'll open up this
322:41 - app
322:42 - to you guys so you guys can use it
322:45 - it's usually a terrible idea but
322:48 - hopefully you guys will be nice
322:52 - david i got an idea maybe from firebase
322:54 - if you see any posts that are not right
322:57 - you can just delete them
323:01 - or just ban those users
323:06 - all right cool so here we go guys
323:08 - let's go to formic post uploader again
323:11 - and one thing i want to do here is let's
323:13 - give the post an email so we're going to
323:15 - say owner email
323:17 - i'm going to say
323:18 - firebase.auth.currentuser.email
323:25 - like this put a comma right there
323:29 - and we don't need this likes anymore
323:32 - because likes will be coming straight
323:34 - from likes by users who liked it for
323:37 - example
323:42 - uh penelope says have to love and leave
323:45 - you all power goes on 15 minutes can't
323:46 - wait to try this one so cool to see a
323:48 - super pro get excited about the little
323:50 - wins also
323:51 - hey thank you penelope i appreciate it
323:53 - and uh if you can stay for the demo
323:56 - that'll be awesome i'd love to have you
323:58 - so here it says good job man you're king
323:59 - thank you brother appreciate it
324:02 - uh why didn't i use
324:03 - postgres sql because i don't want to
324:06 - mess around with networking and
324:09 - sockets and spend hours writing a
324:12 - database
324:18 - and i i want to have like stuff in real
324:20 - time with postgres you won't have real
324:22 - time
324:27 - okay so now we want to give users the
324:30 - ability to like and unlike posts
324:33 - um
324:36 - man that's gonna be a massive one
324:38 - actually
324:45 - all right let's go to
324:51 - oh is the likes
324:54 - okay let's go to post
324:59 - and uh right inside of posts
325:04 - um
325:05 - where we have likes
325:12 - okay so inside of likes instead of
325:14 - post.likes what we're gonna say is
325:16 - post.likes
325:18 - by users
325:21 - likes by users dot
325:24 - length
325:25 - and put that length into locale string
325:29 - and turn that into likes
325:31 - okay so here's what that means you guys
325:33 - currently see that this has zero likes
325:35 - right now right now watch what happens
325:37 - i'm gonna go here
325:40 - and i'm gonna go inside of the post
325:43 - and that post now i'm going to give it a
325:46 - field and we're going to just say
325:49 - quasi clever programmer
325:55 - like that
325:57 - and let's uh also add another one
326:00 - and this time let's make this so now
326:02 - let's say this post is liked by david
326:04 - and qazi let's go back and you'll see
326:06 - that that post now has two likes
326:09 - it's being pulled from the database
326:17 - okay
326:18 - now let's go to post footer
326:26 - post footer component right here
326:34 - [Music]
326:35 - full opacity
326:37 - on press
326:40 - okay so post footer is going to take in
326:47 - a handle like function
326:56 - take in post as well
327:07 - uh where is this getting post
327:09 - information right now post footer
327:10 - interesting
327:14 - so let's give it those things from the
327:16 - top here suppose footer let's give it
327:18 - post equals post
327:20 - and then we're going to give it handle
327:23 - like
327:24 - will be handle
327:26 - like
327:30 - now it's gonna break because it doesn't
327:31 - know what handle like is so right
327:33 - underneath posts we're gonna create a
327:35 - function called const handle like
327:38 - they'll know how to handle a like and
327:40 - this is how it'll work
327:42 - so it will get the current like status
327:46 - and here's we're gonna do
328:02 - okay
328:03 - so basically what does not means here
328:06 - why we're putting that knot is basically
328:08 - like
328:10 - every time you click it it will
328:11 - alternate the status
328:13 - okay so that's why you're saying it's
328:15 - not what it currently is so if it's true
328:18 - and you click it on the handle like
328:20 - it'll turn it to true
328:22 - if it's or sorry if it's true already if
328:24 - it's filled up already and you click it
328:26 - it will turn it to false if it's false
328:28 - and you click it it'll turn it to true
328:31 - okay so it's basically saying like look
328:33 - for this post likes by users and see if
328:36 - the current user's email is in there
328:39 - and then
328:41 - just if it is then make it false if it
328:43 - isn't then make it true
328:48 - so nice little hack there
328:50 - and then we're gonna do db collection
328:52 - users
328:54 - dot doc post dot owner
328:58 - email we're gonna do dot collection
329:01 - posts
329:08 - and then we're going to do doc get the
329:10 - post id
329:13 - we'll do update we'll update that
329:15 - existing post
329:16 - and we're gonna say likes we're gonna
329:18 - update the specific field which is
329:20 - called likes by users
329:22 - and we're gonna get we're gonna say if
329:24 - the current like status is true
329:27 - then add it to the database and we're
329:29 - basically going to say
329:29 - firebase.firestore
329:33 - fieldvalue
329:36 - dot array union
329:41 - and what this is allowing us to do is
329:43 - it's to write this to the database and
329:46 - we're just going to pass in the user's
329:48 - email
329:50 - currentuser.email
329:55 - all right
329:57 - so do that otherwise what we want you to
330:00 - do is wow
330:02 - wow
330:03 - co-pilot is so sick
330:05 - so here's what we're saying the likes by
330:07 - users field if i just liked it and the
330:11 - current like status is that i hearted it
330:13 - then add it to the database that's all
330:15 - add it to that specific array
330:18 - okay so this array added to this array
330:22 - it's basically equivalent to dot push
330:24 - this
330:27 - firestart.fieldvalue.arrayunion is like
330:28 - equivalent.push
330:35 - all right
330:37 - and add the user's email otherwise
330:40 - remove the user's email
330:42 - from
330:43 - the array
330:46 - cool so now we have made this
330:49 - let's get access to our databases now
330:51 - and firebase import we're going to say
330:54 - firebase comma db from
331:01 - firebase
331:07 - like this
331:08 - we do need access to use state and use
331:11 - effect
331:15 - okay
331:18 - so handle like is looking good to me
331:22 - um and then all we want to do is if it
331:25 - works then we want to say dot then
331:27 - [Music]
331:29 - we would just want to add like a dot
331:31 - then statement here and so what that
331:33 - will basically look like is the
331:34 - following it'll just be this
331:37 - okay so if it works then say document
331:39 - successfully updated otherwise say error
331:42 - updating document
331:44 - and show me the error
331:47 - okay
331:51 - a post footer i'm going to pass it in my
331:53 - post and handle like
332:01 - [Music]
332:02 - and then inside of my post footer we're
332:04 - now going to do a bunch of stuff
332:07 - so
332:08 - right underneath this left container
332:10 - this zero right here this is the heart
332:13 - icon
332:15 - and we want to do stuff with this heart
332:18 - icon so
332:24 - to make it a lot simpler actually what
332:26 - i'm just going to do is i'm just going
332:27 - to replace it with an image
332:29 - i'm going to say image style and i'm
332:31 - going to say styles.footer
332:34 - icon
332:36 - and i'm just going to say source
332:39 - is
332:41 - going to be uri
332:51 - and then we can just go
332:52 - icons of zero
332:55 - dot image url
333:06 - uh sorry my bad post footer icons
333:13 - cool so right now we didn't really
333:15 - change anything but all i did is i made
333:17 - it a um
333:19 - uh image okay and i'll show you why i
333:21 - made it an image so i can like do more
333:23 - stuff to this so i'm gonna
333:25 - wrap it in a touchable opacity
333:31 - [Music]
333:33 - let's wrap this in a touchable opacity
333:40 - there's like a war going on about the
333:42 - fonts i love it thank you penelope for
333:45 - the defense i appreciate it
333:49 - all right so touchable opacity we're
333:51 - basically going to say on press
333:54 - call my hand the like function
333:56 - and
333:58 - hand the like and give it the post
334:05 - okay
334:08 - and then my handle like function will
334:09 - know what to do with it
334:17 - so let's click this button and let's
334:19 - watch what happens
334:21 - i'm getting uh error evaluating firebase
334:29 - let's
334:36 - refresh so the error is probably coming
334:39 - from handle like
334:52 - ah because i think in my head because i
334:54 - don't have a owner email i believe so
334:57 - we're going to give this post an owner
334:59 - email
335:01 - so let's go owner
335:03 - email
335:08 - quasi plus three
335:14 - there we go
335:20 - so now let's hit the hard button okay
335:23 - it's still giving an error
335:25 - so let's see what the error is firebase
335:26 - off the current
335:28 - ah misspelled current there we go
335:37 - no document to update
335:48 - ah
335:49 - i need to get the post so let's do this
335:51 - let's go to home screen
335:54 - and uh here's what we're gonna do i
335:56 - figured it out
335:59 - first of all we need to order these by
336:00 - the most recent post because right now
336:02 - it's not ordered by the most recent
336:04 - posts
336:10 - okay so we're gonna do dot
336:13 - order by
336:16 - and we're gonna do created at
336:18 - descending
336:21 - dot on snapshot
336:24 - set post and then there's this other
336:26 - hack that we're gonna do so for doc
336:28 - what we're gonna do is we're gonna say
336:29 - the following
336:32 - return
336:33 - so first of all it's an implicit return
336:36 - this is important okay this is a very
336:38 - common place where people get tripped up
336:40 - but what i'm returning is an object
336:46 - all right and uh this object will
336:48 - basically be
336:50 - for id give me doc dot data
336:53 - uh sorry
336:57 - for id give me doc dot id and then just
337:00 - destructure the data
337:02 - there we go
337:04 - so now what i'm doing is for each of the
337:06 - posts i'm getting their id that's the
337:08 - most important part so
337:10 - for each post
337:12 - uh get its id support this is
337:14 - essentially like post.id
337:17 - okay
337:17 - um i can even make it simpler by just
337:20 - changing this here with post.id and then
337:23 - like post.data
337:26 - all right
337:28 - um
337:29 - and now we're passing that down through
337:32 - set posts
337:34 - and posts right here now we have access
337:36 - to that id
337:38 - so now when we go inside of post
337:40 - we have access to the post id and we
337:42 - won't have like that weird error
337:44 - happening that we were having
337:51 - what's the error happening now
337:54 - so the query requires a collection group
337:57 - you guys can see so here's a cool little
337:59 - thing i'll show you guys whenever that
338:01 - happens because what i'm doing is i'm
338:04 - the problem we're having is it's saying
338:05 - hey it's a collection group and you're
338:07 - trying to do order by hey buddy you're
338:09 - trying to do too many things you need to
338:11 - create an index for it so let's so look
338:14 - at this just command click it and
338:16 - firebase is so smart it already knows
338:19 - what you needed to create
338:21 - so this is what it's saying add an
338:22 - exemption post created ad collection
338:24 - group descending just hit save
338:28 - now for whatever reason this takes a
338:30 - really long time to work so what i'm
338:33 - going to do temporarily is i'm just
338:35 - going to remove this order by for now
338:37 - then we'll bring that back in so david
338:39 - if i forget just remind me
338:44 - i will hit a hard sign
338:46 - and look at that you guys the like just
338:49 - went up from two to three look at that
338:51 - two to three and if i go to the database
338:56 - likes by users
338:57 - right so watch this if i bring this uh
339:00 - here
339:03 - watch what happens when i click the
339:04 - heart
339:05 - it at it takes it out to the database
339:07 - click the heart again adds to the
339:09 - database
339:11 - so it's completely working you guys
339:14 - but now all we need to do is just make
339:16 - the heart turn red when it's clicked or
339:19 - when it's not clicked
339:21 - alright so
339:22 - let's just make the heart turn red now
339:30 - welcome welcome everybody who's here
339:37 - all right let's just take a look if my
339:40 - so this see guys it's still loading like
339:41 - this takes minutes it takes like five
339:44 - minutes or something it's crazy i don't
339:46 - know why it's that slow it's so weird
339:58 - now we just need to do the ui part and
340:00 - the ui part is pretty simple okay so
340:03 - let's go back to post and let's just
340:05 - make sure that the heart shows red and
340:07 - so all we need to update there is the
340:09 - image source
340:10 - okay so let's go get the
340:15 - the zeroth image post footer icon zero
340:17 - which is the heart icon
340:20 - right and all we need to do here
340:23 - is basically add a conditional and we
340:25 - need to say hey
340:29 - if post dot likes
340:32 - by users
340:34 - dot includes
340:36 - [Music]
340:42 - includes
340:43 - firebase
340:45 - dot auth
340:47 - dot current user dot email
340:52 - uh if this is the case
340:56 - then what i want you to do
341:00 - is
341:01 - give me icons
341:03 - or sorry post footer
341:08 - icons of zero
341:12 - dot
341:12 - dot liked
341:16 - image url
341:19 - otherwise just give me the
341:21 - regular image url
341:23 - like that okay so basically if i've
341:25 - already liked it give me the like damage
341:27 - otherwise give me the non-liked image
341:30 - and let's give it a try now hey look at
341:32 - that
341:34 - the red every time i heart it it
341:37 - up you guys
341:39 - so that is absolutely brilliant we are
341:42 - doing a great job here
341:47 - um and that's it you guys that is it
341:51 - we are done with the firebase
341:54 - build
341:55 - so i hope that you enjoyed or the react
341:58 - native clone
342:00 - instagram clone with react native we're
342:02 - pretty much freaking done you guys now
342:03 - all we want to do is we just want to
342:04 - open it up to you
342:06 - and hopefully you guys get to jump in
342:09 - and uh enjoy this with us okay
342:12 - tons of functionality that we added
342:14 - and let's take a look we want you guys
342:16 - to be able to use this
342:18 - okay just make sure that you guys you
342:21 - guys can add in your jpeg images and
342:23 - things like that you can log in and log
342:25 - out create a user account so i'll see
342:27 - hopefully if we can get this to work
342:34 - [Music]
342:40 - so here are the rules if you want to add
342:42 - a post you go here to the image right
