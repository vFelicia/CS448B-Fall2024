00:00 - - I actually have black
coffee right now with me.
00:03 - (gulping sound) Ah.
00:05 - You know, this really
feels like a morning show
00:08 - and I kinda like it.
00:09 - Hey you, what is up, how is it going?
00:13 - This is Papa Python from
cleverprogrammer.com.
00:18 - I'm starting something new today.
00:20 - I was inspired by one of my friends.
00:23 - She taught me about something called
00:24 - daily method of operation.
00:27 - I'm gonna talk to you
guys about this as well,
00:29 - but what I'm starting is
a 30 day video challenge
00:33 - where every single day I make a video.
00:36 - I don't know if I'm gonna be posting it
00:38 - every single day, but definitely
00:39 - for the next 30 days,
I'll be making a video
00:42 - every single day
00:43 - and today marks day one of that challenge.
00:47 - I'll also talk to you
about what inspired this
00:52 - and how I'm gonna be getting it done
00:55 - and hopefully it inspires
you to do the things
00:58 - that you need to do.
01:00 - For example, if you are working hard
01:03 - to become a better developer,
01:05 - work either on your negotiation skills
01:07 - or your actual technical skills,
01:09 - then you can use the
tools I'm gonna be using
01:13 - and talking about in this video
01:14 - to your advantage so that you can have
01:17 - a system, a discipline, to practice,
01:20 - become better, and improve.
01:22 - In terms of programming, I
feel I have a lot of it down,
01:26 - but when it comes to this,
this was my challenge.
01:31 - Maybe at the end of this video,
01:33 - I'm gonna ask you, and not
maybe, I'm definitely gonna
01:35 - ask you by the end of this
video that you put down
01:38 - what challenge you can commit
to for the next 30 days.
01:41 - It could be really fun and exciting,
01:43 - because we can both be in this together.
01:45 - So I would want you to comment
01:48 - and I want you already to
start thinking about it,
01:50 - but I want you to then later comment.
01:51 - What is the one challenge
you can commit to?
01:53 - And it doesn't have to be something
01:54 - as hard as, well, for
most people this might
01:57 - seem pretty hard, but for me
this is not that difficult.
02:00 - So make sure you pick something that's
02:02 - not that difficult, it
doesn't have to be something
02:03 - like you have to make a video.
02:05 - It could be 20 minutes of
coding challenge every day
02:08 - or 15 minutes of meditation challenge,
02:13 - whatever it is that you
feel that could help you.
02:15 - So I'm gonna talk to you about the DMO,
02:19 - daily method of operation, for a second.
02:22 - Essentially what this
really is, is what are
02:26 - the things you need to do that you cannot,
02:30 - that even if you were
imprisoned by somebody,
02:33 - you'd be able to do.
02:36 - You have to come up
with a few that you have
02:38 - and what's amazing about
this concept is how simple
02:42 - it is, yet it is extremely effective
02:44 - and can really help you get a
lot of things back on track.
02:48 - This concept is,
02:51 - it's easy, it's very simple,
02:53 - but it is very effective.
02:55 - So it's deceptively simple
02:57 - and once you might hear of it,
02:58 - you might go, oh, this seems too easy,
03:01 - so I'm not gonna do it,
because that's not gonna work.
03:05 - All right, it might even
sound a little stupid,
03:07 - but I promise you that if you actually
03:10 - pay attention, it'll blow your mind.
03:11 - So check it out.
03:12 - So daily method of operation.
03:14 - Every day we have these tasks,
03:16 - we have these things that
if we just did those things,
03:21 - we'd be on the right track.
03:23 - For example, the one that really hit me
03:26 - and it actually has been hitting me a lot,
03:29 - because I was traveling
and it was December
03:32 - and I was vacationing
and I was with my friends
03:34 - and family and my routine
got all messed up,
03:37 - so waking up became a lot
harder than it used to be.
03:42 - I would just wake up
at 6 AM and get going,
03:44 - but I've been out of that momentum,
03:47 - so now it's like I'll wake up at six
03:48 - and then I'll snooze and
then I'll wake up at eight
03:50 - and then I'll snooze and wake up at ten
03:52 - and I might snooze or I might not.
03:55 - Every day it's like I'm
waking up at a different time
03:58 - and it causes my body to just go crazy.
04:01 - With the daily method of operation,
04:04 - one of the things that I picked as my
04:06 - daily method of operation
and this is really
04:08 - inspired by again my
friend, her name is Karissa,
04:11 - and she's one Tony Robbins'
international speakers.
04:15 - One of out six.
04:16 - So she's pretty badass.
04:18 - But she said that one of
hers is wake up, stay up,
04:21 - which I love, which I stole right from her
04:24 - and so I'll put this down,
so one of mine is now
04:28 - wake up, stay up.
04:32 - Wake up, stay up,
04:34 - what this means is,
right when you wake up,
04:36 - you just stay up.
04:38 - All right, it's just a simple rule.
04:39 - Simple little thing.
04:40 - But it makes all the
difference in the world.
04:42 - So this means no snoozing
your alarm clock,
04:45 - no anything else.
04:47 - It's just, right when I wake up,
04:49 - I remember wake up, stay up
04:50 - and then I'm just gently get out of bed
04:53 - and I'm like, okay, I gotta get moving,
04:55 - I gotta get going.
04:56 - So wake up, stay up is something that
04:59 - helps me out a lot.
05:01 - Another thing that she said was,
05:04 - another thing that actually
can be really helpful
05:06 - is if you set your alarm
outside of your room.
05:11 - So if you set your alarm in your room,
05:14 - it's gonna be difficult to get up.
05:16 - What I started doing and
what I encourage you to do
05:18 - is set up your alarm
outside of your room, right?
05:21 - For example, I'll ask, I'll be like,
05:24 - Hey, Alexa, wake me up
at 8 AM to going bad.
05:30 - - [Alexa] Sorry, I'm not sure.
05:32 - - So you see how awesome
Alexa is and how easily
05:35 - she understood everything?
05:36 - But anyway, normally she works,
05:38 - of course she's not gonna work right now,
05:39 - she's being bad.
05:41 - You can have her wake you up.
05:42 - If you don't have Alexa,
you can have something
05:45 - else wake you up, you
can have an alarm clock,
05:47 - but just set it outside of
your room on your phone.
05:50 - I like waking up to music that I like
05:53 - instead of the alarm clock,
05:54 - which is like (obnoxious beeping sound)
05:58 - I just wanna smash somebody's face in.
06:00 - That's one thing that I like about that.
06:03 - And then, so one is wake up and stay up.
06:07 - Then the next thing, and
these are things that
06:09 - you normally wouldn't do.
06:11 - For example, I wanted to put
06:13 - as my daily method of operation,
06:15 - I wanted to put coffee,
06:17 - but I don't need to put that,
06:18 - because I get a black
coffee all the time anyway.
06:21 - It's not hard for me, so I don't actually
06:23 - need to write it down and commit to it
06:25 - as my daily method of operation.
06:27 - I actually have black
coffee right now with me.
06:29 - (gulping sound) Ah.
06:33 - You know, this really
feels like a morning show.
06:36 - And I kinda like it.
06:39 - We're gonna do this every morning,
06:41 - this is exciting.
06:42 - The one that I do need is water.
06:45 - Water is amazing for you, but I just don't
06:47 - drink enough of it, so my second thing is
06:50 - to drink not six ounces of water,
06:53 - but just a water bottle.
06:56 - You could have yours be
just drink a cup of water
07:00 - and that's pretty good.
07:01 - The one that I just started now,
07:04 - the daily method of
operation, and this one
07:06 - is a little difficult, but for example,
07:08 - you can do multiple other ones,
07:10 - but the one I'm doing right now
07:12 - is 30 minutes,
07:15 - phoneless 30 minutes.
07:17 - This is phoneless, so I
can't be using my phone.
07:21 - I'm basically gonna be
making a video in that time.
07:24 - You can do anything that you want
07:27 - in this time frame.
07:29 - For example, for me, it's a 30 minutes
07:32 - I'm gonna spend every morning
07:33 - after I wake up, stay up, water bottle,
07:35 - I'm gonna make a video for you
07:37 - and for myself.
07:39 - You can do video or you can write
07:43 - or you can actually use this time to code
07:46 - or meditate.
07:49 - Really, whatever it is
that you find important
07:52 - and that you find that you need to do.
07:55 - For me, it's definitely,
I have used this time
07:59 - in the past for meditation.
08:01 - I've used this time in
the past for journaling.
08:04 - I've used this time in the past
for listening to something,
08:08 - but now I'm committing to doing,
08:10 - I've also used it for writing,
08:12 - so I wrote for 30 days and then beyond,
08:14 - and for those of you who were following me
08:17 - on Snapchat or Instagram,
you can actually see it
08:20 - and I hold myself accountable
to it every single day.
08:23 - If you are on this channel,
08:25 - definitely follow me on Instagram,
08:28 - and the reason is that
I am very, very active
08:31 - on Instagram, way more active than YouTube
08:34 - or any other platform.
08:35 - If you want to get in
touch with me one on one,
08:37 - you'll kind of be surprised by how likely,
08:40 - how easy it would be
for you to get in touch
08:43 - with me through Instagram.
08:44 - If you send me something cool
and/or interesting question,
08:47 - but if you just go crazy saying something
08:49 - I might ignore you.
08:51 - But most importantly,
even if it's not for you
08:54 - to get in touch with me, you can actually
08:56 - use it as inspiration,
'cause I'm gonna be logging
08:59 - the real stuff that I'm
doing day in and day out.
09:02 - You can also see my routine there
09:04 - and what I'm doing, so you
can actually steal that,
09:08 - reverse engineer it for yourself
09:10 - and then put it on steroids
09:11 - and get much better results
than even I'm getting
09:13 - in those departments.
09:15 - All right, so we have all of this stuff
09:17 - and after this, another
DMO that you could have,
09:20 - that I have in my life, is something to do
09:24 - with fitness.
09:27 - All right, you could have your DMO,
09:29 - your daily method of
operation have something
09:32 - to do with fitness.
09:34 - It could be as easy as doing ten push-ups,
09:38 - or if that's not easy,
then sit-ups or whatever
09:41 - is easy for you.
09:42 - All the way to going to
the gym and working out.
09:45 - Some kind of workout should be part
09:47 - of your daily regimen.
09:48 - The reason why this is there,
even if you're kidnapped,
09:52 - you can still just kind of work out
09:55 - or do something.
09:56 - Unless they really have
you tied down really badly.
09:59 - Then you're kinda screwed.
10:00 - But in most cases, in
most abduction cases,
10:04 - that's not gonna happen.
10:05 - Let's not go too far with that,
10:06 - but the point is that
you can do this wherever.
10:10 - Okay, you can do this wherever.
10:12 - Now the video part that I'm doing,
10:14 - you can't do that
wherever, that's difficult.
10:16 - I'm gonna need to
request a camera for that
10:19 - or something.
10:20 - But for you to meditate or for you to code
10:23 - or for you to write,
that you can pretty much
10:25 - do anywhere, right?
10:26 - For coding, coding is thinking.
10:28 - You can actually code on a piece of paper.
10:31 - You can code on a whiteboard,
10:33 - you can code wherever.
10:34 - So these things are, that don't require
10:36 - that much effort.
10:37 - That is my daily method
of operation right now.
10:41 - Once I wake up, I stay up.
10:42 - I will not go back to sleep.
10:44 - I drink a water bottle right at the start
10:47 - of my morning.
10:49 - As soon as I wake up,
I grab my water bottle,
10:52 - then as I'm listening
to, I also put on music
10:55 - that I enjoy.
10:57 - Then after that, I'll do 30
minutes without my phone.
11:01 - And now my challenge is videos,
11:03 - so this is me being here.
11:04 - And lastly, it's gonna be fitness.
11:06 - Actually, right after this video is done,
11:08 - my friend's coming over
and then I'm going boxing.
11:11 - I'm gonna be going and working out
11:13 - right after this finishes.
11:15 - There you have it.
11:16 - (crashing sound)
11:18 - It almost fell into my
coffee, which is not good.
11:21 - (gulping sound) Ah.
11:28 - There you have it.
11:29 - The daily method of operation.
11:32 - Let me put a little
somethin' somethin' on it,
11:35 - you know what I'm saying?
11:36 - Put a little black underline,
11:38 - that doesn't work, there we go.
11:39 - Daily method of operation.
11:41 - In the comments below, I want you
11:44 - to comment if you watched this video,
11:46 - what is your daily method of operation?
11:49 - What are the few simple
things that you're doing
11:52 - that will 10x, 20x your effectiveness,
11:56 - your productivity, but very, very simple.
11:59 - Put your few things that you have,
12:01 - it could be this, and also,
12:04 - if there's a challenge
you wanna commit to,
12:05 - what is that challenge?
12:06 - Pick either of the questions,
12:08 - but go in the comment, answer it,
12:09 - and I will reply to a lot of you.
12:13 - With that said, thank
you so much for watching.
12:15 - That's it for this video.
12:16 - As always, I love your face
12:19 - and I'll see you in the next video.
12:22 - (rhythmic music)
12:31 - (robotic vocalizations)
