00:00 - - CleverProgrammer.com
00:00 - We are actually live.
00:02 - I wanted to take a question
that somebody asked
00:05 - in one of my last livestreams which was,
00:07 - "Hey Qasi, what are the best
web frameworks for Python?"
00:13 - And I'm just gonna add in 2019.
00:15 - But these are not just 2019,
00:17 - these are kind of however many years.
00:20 - So it's not necessarily,
it's gonna be, I think,
00:22 - My answer is gonna be still
the same in 2020 as well.
00:25 - So, that's what we're gonna
talk about in this video.
00:28 - So without any further ado,
let's jump right into it.
00:32 - And I hope you guys are coming in.
00:34 - Drop your questions in the chat as well
00:37 - if you're coming live right
now because we are live.
00:40 - So once you put in questions,
00:42 - my friend Frankie who is
helping me record this
00:45 - will read out your
questions if they're good
00:48 - and then I will answer them as well.
00:49 - But with that said, let's jump into
00:51 - what is the best web frameworks.
00:53 - So, for me, there are mainly two
00:57 - web frameworks that I wanna discuss
00:58 - because you can go down the rabbit hole
01:00 - and look up all these different ones too
01:02 - such as Pyramid and all that
01:04 - but I wanna just discuss two main ones.
01:06 - One is called Flask.
01:11 - And then the other one is called
01:17 - as one of our students in our program
01:20 - Profitable Shortcut says,
01:22 - his name is Donny by the way,
01:23 - as Donny says, De-Jango.
01:26 - but this is actually pronounced Django.
01:28 - So you have Django and you have Flask
01:31 - which are the two main
ones that I wanna discuss.
01:35 - Now, let's talk about some
pros and cons of Flask.
01:39 - So Flask, what's nice
about Flask is that it's
01:44 - really lightweight, so I'll put that here,
01:46 - lightweight, it's really light.
01:50 - Another cool thing about
Flask is that there isn't much
01:54 - magic going on so I'll like say no magic.
02:01 - You don't have to go too deep
to understand what's going on.
02:05 - So, it's easy...
02:12 - to understand.
02:18 - That's another nice thing about Flask.
02:21 - And those are some of the main things that
02:24 - I wanna talk about regarding Flask.
02:28 - When you're coding in Flask,
02:29 - everything will make a lot of sense.
02:32 - How do you route a view
will make a lot of sense.
02:36 - And everything is very, very simple.
02:39 - So I definitely wanna
add that too about it,
02:41 - that's it's very simple.
02:44 - And this is something that
if you're starting out,
02:49 - I would actually say
02:50 - as a complete beginner to web development,
02:53 - you should definitely
do some stuff with Flask
02:57 - before continuing on to
another web framework.
03:00 - Now, I'm not saying you can't
do advanced stuff with it.
03:02 - You can go from being a beginner,
03:05 - and you can still do really
advanced things in Flask.
03:11 - So it doesn't mean that
you can't, you know,
03:12 - there's some really big
companies using Flask
03:15 - and you can still do really
amazing stuff with it.
03:17 - So, whether you're a complete
beginner or you're advanced,
03:20 - this framework, web development framework
03:23 - is gonna be a good one.
03:24 - There isn't much magic,
it's easy to understand,
03:27 - it's really lightweight, it doesn't come
03:29 - with what we call batteries included,
03:32 - so it doesn't come with all
these different things installed
03:34 - which makes it, you
know, really lightweight.
03:39 - Then we have De-jango,
my friend, we got Django.
03:44 - Which marker should I
use for this one, Hmm.
03:47 - Let's use green because a lot of...
03:52 - Django's favorite, Django's
main theme color is green.
03:57 - What I like about Django.
03:59 - First of all, their slogan is awesome.
04:02 - It's...
04:04 - for perfectionists...
04:11 - with...
04:14 - deadlines.
04:18 - So that's number one which is super cool.
04:21 - It's for perfectionists with deadlines.
04:24 - So perfectionists who have deadlines,
04:27 - wanna get stuff done as fast as possible.
04:30 - So, Flask, it's lightweight, it's awesome,
04:33 - but let's say you're working for a client,
04:36 - and the client does not care whether
04:38 - you use Flask framework or Django.
04:41 - They just want a project completed.
04:45 - This is gonna allow you to do it.
04:47 - Django is gonna allow you
to build that project faster
04:50 - because it comes with batteries included.
04:53 - So it comes in with
functionalities built into it
04:56 - like, you know, admin.
05:00 - You know how on WordPress
if you make a website
05:02 - you have access to then,
05:05 - automatically when you make a website,
05:06 - you can go and change the blog post,
05:08 - you can add new posts, you
can add pictures to it,
05:11 - you can manage spam comments,
you can add a captcha,
05:15 - and do it all from an
administrator interface,
05:19 - you don't sit there and code PHP directly,
05:22 - you're actually just using
a point and click interface,
05:27 - and Django comes with the
administrator interface built in.
05:31 - Which is really nice when
you're say working with a client
05:34 - and you wanna just hand
them over the app right
05:37 - when you're done and they can
just use a lot of the things
05:39 - from the admin interface.
05:41 - Okay, this is something that
for Flask you would actually
05:44 - have to build from scratch
05:45 - whereas in Django, it comes built-in.
05:49 - Now Django is a lot of batteries included.
05:59 - So it's a pretty heavyweight framework,
06:02 - it comes with lots of
functionalities built-in
06:04 - which is why it also comes with
06:06 - an administrator interface built in.
06:09 - So while it's really awesome
06:12 - that you can get a lot
of stuff done faster,
06:16 - sometimes what happens is that
06:19 - it's not so easy to understand right away.
06:22 - And you see how I said no magic?
06:25 - There is a lot of what we
call magic going on in Django
06:30 - which makes it tougher to
understand what's happening
06:33 - because it's pulling so much stuff
06:35 - from already installed
packages and modules
06:39 - and it makes your code
look like magic, okay.
06:44 - So that's kind of why we say that.
06:47 - Some of the things might
look mysterious, let's say.
06:51 - You know, they won't be how
you do stuff from scratch.
06:55 - So for Django, you know for
Flask once you learn the basics
06:59 - you can kind of keep going and
not run into lots of problems
07:01 - whereas with Django you
might run into these problems
07:05 - that are kind of harder to
solve, they're very mysterious.
07:10 - So that's what I would say.
07:12 - This still works for beginners,
07:15 - it's not like you won't understand it
07:17 - if somebody's explaining
it to you but you know,
07:20 - once you get past Flask
07:23 - and understand how basic
web development works,
07:25 - cause I think Flask will be easier for you
07:29 - to understand the concepts.
07:30 - Alright, it's better to understand them.
07:32 - So I'll say, I'll even write
this, I'll write it here.
07:37 - Concepts...
07:39 - So it's easier to understand the overall
07:42 - web development concepts using Flask
07:45 - but then once you kind of grasp it
07:48 - you can actually come into here
07:51 - and you know, I'll say for intermediates,
07:58 - It's kind of a stretch,
even if you're a beginner,
08:00 - you can start to learn
Django and you'll get it.
08:03 - It's not that difficult.
08:05 - And I have a video course on it as well,
08:08 - which is on YouTube, it's absolutely free,
08:10 - you can look up Python
Django tutorial in 2018.
08:14 - Speaking of which, I
might make one in 2019.
08:16 - I think that'd be cool.
08:17 - So there's intermediate and this is also
08:20 - really good for advanced as well.
08:25 - Now, I've explained to you
the benefits of both of these
08:32 - but I'm gonna also give
you my personal opinion.
08:35 - I don't wanna be just that
theoretical teacher who gives you
08:40 - the pros and cons and just
goes okay, you decide.
08:43 - My personal preference and
my favorite web framework
08:48 - is Django.
08:56 - Okay, that's my favorite framework.
08:59 - Oh, sorry, the battery is
about to die on the phone,
09:03 - so we're just making
sure everything's okay.
09:05 - Is it still live, are we
still getting comments
09:07 - and stuff coming in or whatever?
09:09 - Okay, cool.
09:12 - Sorry, guys.
09:14 - So, let me know once it's plugged in.
09:18 - Good?
09:20 - We're good?
09:20 - Cool.
09:21 - Okay, now, I wanna talk about
09:24 - why Django is my favorite framework.
09:27 - When I'm working I wanna build stuff fast.
09:32 - So this allows you to build fast.
09:39 - Here, because you're doing
all the things from scratch,
09:45 - while it's gonna be easier to
understand what you're doing,
09:48 - you're gonna be building things slow.
09:49 - Because you're gonna need to build
09:51 - so much functionality
09:54 - from scratch
09:56 - whereas here,
09:58 - a lot of the functionality
that you're gonna be building,
10:02 - essentially a lot of it
is gonna come built-in
10:04 - so you're gonna very quickly
be able to put things together.
10:11 - So that's why it's my personal preference.
10:14 - It's because I care more
about being able to,
10:17 - I wanna be more productive as a developer.
10:20 - And if I'm more productive as a developer,
10:22 - then I can build things faster.
10:24 - And if I can ship code faster,
10:29 - I have the potential
10:31 - to fulfill my clients' needs faster,
10:37 - and therefore I can get paid
faster and get paid more.
10:41 - I can work with more clients.
10:44 - And that is why I like Django
because it's very practical
10:51 - and it allows me to do things really fast.
10:54 - If you're completely starting
out and you don't understand
10:57 - the concepts of web development,
10:59 - this might confuse you a little bit
11:02 - but when you're going
through basic tutorials,
11:05 - there's a really great guide by Miguel,
11:09 - Miguel, what's his name,
11:11 - if you type in flask tutorial by Miguel,
11:15 - M-I-G-U-E-L,
11:19 - you're gonna get this epic
web development tutorial
11:22 - using Flask, it's written,
11:24 - and you can kind of go through it
11:25 - and you will really start to understand
11:27 - the concepts of how web development works
11:31 - and once you go through that
11:32 - and you really understand it then
11:33 - what you'll realize, to do
the same things in Django,
11:37 - oh my God it's so much easier.
11:39 - You know how you can build models,
11:41 - how everything just automatically
works with a database,
11:43 - how it understands your code between views
11:46 - and your models and all of that.
11:49 - It's really beautiful
11:50 - and allows you to do things really fast.
11:52 - And then the ORM of Django
is personally I think,
11:58 - easier to understand
12:00 - and allows you to build things faster,
12:03 - but again, guys, that's
my personal preference,
12:06 - everybody has their own
personal preference,
12:08 - so drop in the chat below
12:10 - what's your favorite web framework?
12:13 - Is it Flask?
12:14 - Or is it Django?
12:16 - And why do you prefer that?
12:18 - Because I would like to learn from
12:19 - your perspective too what you like.
12:21 - So are there any questions
coming in or anything?
12:24 - There's no chat?
12:28 - Let's see what's going on, guys.
12:32 - - [Cameraman] Okay, Django has
future, it is free to publish
12:35 - Is it free to publish?
12:36 - - Yes, there's stuff coming in,
12:37 - I don't know why you're
not telling me anything.
12:39 - Okay so, is it free to publish?
12:42 - Yes, Flask and Django is free to publish.
12:46 - Also, Django has a lot of
future and so does Flask.
12:51 - Both of these have a lot of future,
12:53 - it's not ever running out of future.
12:55 - Okay, so 2019, 2020, 2021,
12:59 - maybe 2021 you might have
a different framework
13:02 - but if you understand these
concepts, you are gonna be fine.
13:06 - There are so many big
companies built off of Django
13:08 - and Flask and they're not
gonna change their framework
13:10 - just cause of 2020 and 2021, right?
13:14 - If Instagram, so much of the
code is written in Django,
13:17 - which it is, they're
not just gonna switch to
13:21 - another framework like that.
13:23 - That takes a lot of time and effort
13:26 - and hours of code and tons
of developer time and money
13:31 - and so you know, they're
not gonna change it
13:33 - til many, many years later, yes.
13:36 - - [Cameraman] They ask, and
what's better with big data?
13:40 - - Okay, so, which one
is better with big data?
13:43 - Again, you can choose
whichever framework you want
13:46 - but I would personally
prefer Django again,
13:49 - because I just get to build things faster.
13:52 - When you're working with big data,
13:53 - it's not that Flask or Django
13:56 - will specifically allow you to
do more things with big data,
14:02 - for big data you have to know how to use
14:04 - other types of libraries like Matplotlib
14:07 - and you need to know seaborn,
14:08 - and you need to know what
are those other, Pandas,
14:12 - so I can write that down but
I just wanna keep the board
14:16 - like this for our purposes
14:18 - but you know there are different libraries
14:20 - that you need to understand and learn
14:22 - and then you can just implement them
14:24 - into any of these frameworks.
14:26 - So if you're doing big data,
14:30 - it's not like one is gonna
favor more than the other.
14:34 - But these general principles
14:35 - that I explained here still apply.
14:39 - - [Cameraman] Would you
say it's better to start
14:41 - with Django or with Flask?
14:43 - - Okay, so, if you are
a complete beginner,
14:46 - do some stuff with Flask first.
14:48 - Because that will allow you to understand.
14:51 - You know, I said it's easy
to understand and simple.
14:53 - So if you're completely beginner
14:55 - and never done anything
with web development
14:57 - do some stuff with Flask first,
15:00 - that will allow you to understand
how web development works,
15:04 - and then move on to Django
and you're gonna be able
15:06 - to see the beauty of how powerful it is
15:09 - and how quickly it allows
you to put things together.
15:13 - If you're interested in going
15:15 - and becoming a Django developer
15:18 - and becoming a full stack developer,
15:20 - the Profitable Programmer
course that we have
15:23 - at Clever Programmer
does help you with that.
15:26 - So if that's something
you're interested in,
15:28 - just pop over to CleverProgrammer.com
15:31 - put in your email there and your name
15:33 - and I will send you these
three epic trainings and
15:36 - I'll send you this epic
masterclass completely for free.
15:40 - And if you decide that's
amazing value and you love it
15:44 - and you wanna join our
Profitable Programmer course,
15:47 - it'll make you essentially
15:48 - a full stack Django web developer.
15:52 - Alright, so that's what that teaches you.
15:54 - And it also covers the first few projects.
15:59 - One of the first projects
with Flask so then you can
16:02 - understand how web development works
16:04 - and then we move you
over onto using Django
16:07 - and becoming a Django
full stack developer.
16:12 - Any other..
16:13 - - [Cameraman] Best IDE for Python?
16:16 - - Okay, best IDE, I've explained in
16:18 - one of my other videos is PyCharm,
16:20 - I think it's really good, yes.
16:22 - - [Cameraman] Best front end framework,
16:23 - Django, Vue JS, or React?
16:26 - - Okay, so for front end framework,
16:29 - Django I don't think is
considered a frontend framework,
16:33 - unless I'm wrong?
16:34 - This is more like a backend framework.
16:37 - For front end,
16:39 - I haven't worked with React
16:40 - and I haven't worked with Vue JS
16:43 - but I've heard a lot of people
talking really good things
16:47 - about Vue, but in my experience,
I've seen more people talk
16:51 - about how React works with Django.
16:53 - So I can't give you a great answer there.
16:57 - But based on experience
16:59 - I would say start off with React,
17:01 - with Django and see what you can do, okay,
17:04 - and then move forward with Vue.
17:08 - - [Cameraman] Do I need to learn
17:09 - web development for big data?
17:11 - - You don't need to learn
web development for big data
17:13 - but oftentimes, web
development can help you a lot.
17:19 - Because a lot of the things
that you're gonna be doing
17:21 - will require you to do a
lot of stuff with the web.
17:26 - But no, it's not completely
necessary for you to do that.
17:31 - But you know, if I'm doing big data,
17:32 - and I'm trying to become a data scientist
17:34 - I would like to be able to have a website
17:37 - where I can visualize
that data, show that data,
17:41 - store things in a database,
17:43 - give people the ability
to log in and log out
17:45 - so then they can see their
data, store their data,
17:48 - and all of that.
17:49 - And for that, you're gonna
need to know web development.
17:53 - Also, web development is
an easier point of entry
17:56 - to start getting paid
and become a programmer,
18:01 - whereas big data,
18:03 - is a lot harder to get
into as your first job.
18:07 - So if it's your first job,
18:09 - web development is gonna be a
little bit of an easier route
18:12 - and it might fall in line with your goals
18:15 - of still doing things with big data.
18:17 - So that's why I'm a big proponent of
18:20 - start with web development first
18:24 - and then go on to other things
18:26 - like big data and data science.
18:30 - Anything else that we got that's good?
18:34 - Okay guys, we're gonna wrap it
up, we wanna keep it simple,
18:38 - I wanna try to livestream
for you guys quite often.
18:42 - If this was helpful, let us
know in the comments right now,
18:46 - or in the live chat right now,
18:49 - if this was helpful for you.
18:51 - And if it was we're gonna be
doing a lot more of these.
18:57 - And we have Aaron who's going
18:59 - to be doing most of the
technical trainings.
19:01 - Are they commenting, saying some stuff?
19:04 - - [Cameraman] Thank you very much.
19:05 - - Cool, stuff like that will let us know
19:07 - what they're saying.
19:08 - - [Cameraman] Thank you very much.
19:10 - - Cool.
19:11 - - [Cameraman] What about Boda framework?
19:13 - This was great, thanks.
19:15 - - Okay, cool.
19:16 - Alright, so it looks like
it's helping you guys.
19:19 - I appreciate you guys being
on here, thank you so much.
19:22 - We have Aaron who's gonna be doing
19:23 - a lot of the technical trainings.
19:26 - I wanna focus on more of the
soft skills and negotiations,
19:30 - how you can actually do freelance work,
19:32 - how can you actually land a job,
19:36 - how to deal with interviews,
19:38 - that's where I primarily wanna focus on,
19:40 - how can you have other developers
19:42 - and manage them to do projects for you.
19:46 - So the channel is gonna be turning into
19:48 - where you're gonna be getting
the hard technical trainings,
19:50 - you're also gonna be getting
the soft skill trainings by me.
19:54 - And we're also gonna be coming
out with a brand new program
19:58 - and that program is gonna be called
19:59 - How to Automate Stuff with Python,
20:01 - which I'm really, really,
really excited about
20:06 - and you guys are gonna
find out more about it
20:08 - as the days progress.
20:10 - It's gonna be something really big,
20:11 - something really amazing.
20:13 - But yeah, with that said,
20:15 - thank you guys for being
here, I hope you enjoyed it.
20:17 - If you liked this video
please give it a like,
20:20 - subscribe to the channel
if you haven't already,
20:22 - and as always, I love your face,
20:26 - and I'll see you in the next video.
20:31 - Whoosh!
