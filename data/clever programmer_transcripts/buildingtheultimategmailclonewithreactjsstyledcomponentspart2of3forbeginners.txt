04:19 - yet with this code exactly anybody
04:22 - watching from microsoft
04:26 - just click link
04:29 - [Laughter]
04:30 - all right so we actually have three
04:33 - different parts
04:34 - uh in in the meat wrapper something
04:38 - uh we obviously have a title which uh
04:41 - will
04:42 - say which will say meet
04:45 - or there yes it's saying meet and then
04:49 - we have two p tags
04:52 - where i wrap uh the icon that you see
04:55 - on the left hand side and the text on
04:58 - the right hand side into a p tag so
05:00 - everything is going to be inside of the
05:01 - p tag beautiful
05:04 - yeah and we actually for that
05:07 - we will need to uh
05:10 - import a few different stuff so
05:13 - we have the video camera icon the
05:16 - keyboard
05:16 - icon and for now that is going to be it
05:20 - but
05:21 - for those of you uh okay
05:24 - i just dropped it on line eight and nine
05:28 - so for those of you who are just
05:29 - starting out and you might still be
05:32 - npm installing this is from material ui
05:35 - icons exactly right here so we have guys
05:38 - one icon we're using this video cam and
05:40 - again the way you guys get material like
05:42 - it's pretty simple so we'll take a look
05:43 - at material ui just by simply typing in
05:45 - materialize
05:46 - in google just like this right here so
05:49 - material ui
05:50 - just type that in pop it in right here
05:52 - boom right there
05:53 - material ui but not material like this
05:55 - one you want to do material ui
05:57 - icons okay typed it in boom right here
06:00 - with two ui icons
06:01 - and all you have to do is simply just
06:02 - search for one so let's say for example
06:03 - you want to search for a video
06:05 - so type in video boom right there
06:07 - sayonara it's all beautiful and now you
06:09 - got yourself a video icon looks just
06:11 - like this
06:12 - you click on the video icon which one
06:13 - are we using by the way are we using oh
06:15 - this one okay we are
06:16 - we're using the video this cam icon
06:19 - click on this copy this and that's
06:20 - exactly what david did here guys
06:22 - is he just pasted this portion here in
06:25 - right here
06:26 - he did the exact same thing with the
06:27 - keyboard icon found down here
06:29 - boom boom sayonara and you got it that's
06:32 - it
06:33 - that's it okay simple as that nice super
06:35 - simple and that's it pretty much guys
06:37 - all right awesome let's get going
06:38 - all right now we already imported it so
06:41 - it's time to actually use those icons so
06:43 - the first one is going to use the video
06:46 - cam icon
06:48 - um yes okay
06:52 - and for that we will be typing in a text
06:55 - new meeting okay and it should be
06:59 - showing up really soon but it's going to
07:01 - freak out because we
07:03 - don't define now guys what do you
07:05 - remember oh my god the world is ending
07:08 - but of course the reason oh the reason
07:10 - why we turn on the fight because
07:12 - we need to define it instead of styled
07:14 - components let's go and define it
07:16 - you can see i just did exactly that
07:18 - right there
07:19 - if you if we go down here uh whoops we
07:22 - have this
07:23 - uh thingy so we are using style
07:25 - components again
07:26 - and that's basically wrapping the
07:30 - what's it called css into the javascript
07:33 - file
07:33 - so we don't have to mess with all the
07:35 - because most importantly what's going on
07:37 - what's cool now is that component is
07:38 - basically guys it's almost like you're
07:39 - creating a div
07:40 - in html but you know that div has its
07:43 - own kind of like
07:44 - style right so it's wrapping style fully
07:47 - fully fully around
07:48 - uh around what's it called around um you
07:50 - know uh around
07:52 - this title component and you can see
07:54 - here he created an h4
07:56 - type component now like a div because
07:58 - you can do style.div as we did here
08:00 - but we can also do style style.h4 which
08:03 - is simply just h4 tag and html
08:05 - and so that's kind of power of style
08:06 - components all right go ahead and
08:07 - continue on
08:09 - david davido let's continue on so we
08:11 - have one more icon
08:13 - um to put in the meat wrapper or
08:16 - actually that
08:17 - part and that's going to be the keyboard
08:20 - icon
08:21 - okay nice good so now
08:24 - the one we're working on is this one now
08:26 - the keyboard icon right here go ahead
08:28 - keep going
08:28 - exactly and for that uh the text is
08:32 - join meeting so basically what you can
08:34 - do with google meet is start a new
08:36 - meeting or join
08:37 - an existing meeting beautiful that's
08:39 - exactly what i want to do go ahead good
08:41 - beautiful
08:42 - awesome awesome and now if you go back
08:45 - to the build
08:46 - okay uh it looks a little bit off yeah
08:49 - it looks very much off right
08:50 - so guys let's think about how do we go
08:52 - ahead and make this knot off
08:54 - for one i think we need to go ahead and
08:55 - push this more to the bottom right so
08:57 - push this meat and new medium joint
08:59 - meaning all the way to the bottom right
09:00 - david
09:02 - uh yes yes exactly so
09:05 - for what we will do is we will actually
09:07 - go into the meat wrapper
09:09 - and we will apply some styling over
09:11 - there exactly because
09:12 - go ahead and for that we will be using
09:16 - using position
09:18 - if i can write it down position
09:24 - okay i think i think you're beautiful
09:26 - and you can see here guys that right
09:27 - here this is the me wrapper right here
09:29 - guys
09:30 - and what we're going to do is we're
09:31 - going to position we're going to make
09:32 - that position relative okay and then
09:33 - what's going to happen then david
09:36 - for uh then what we would do is we will
09:38 - say
09:39 - uh leave a third 300 pixel
09:43 - uh right so basically like padding
09:46 - padding like 300 pixels basically we
09:48 - could we could have done that yeah just
09:50 - like that yeah yeah
09:51 - uh-huh go ahead that's 300 pixels okay
09:53 - go ahead and
09:55 - just just to like because in styling
09:59 - all the details matter uh we will do a
10:02 - little border
10:03 - top and that's going to be one pixel and
10:06 - it's going to be solid
10:07 - beautiful and we will be just using the
10:10 - given light gray
10:11 - color nice nice nice once again if i can
10:14 - write it down
10:15 - cool nice
10:18 - that returned it fully to where it was
10:21 - does not see then like it
10:22 - did not like it david oh because uh
10:25 - i forgot to add a semicolon hey let's go
10:29 - forgot to edit my colon that's a typical
10:32 - you know
10:32 - uh you know that's typical typical
10:35 - developer
10:36 - exactly i mean the first like when you
10:39 - face a bug the first thing you should be
10:41 - looking at is semicolons if those are
10:44 - right
10:44 - then there is something error okay all
10:47 - right
10:48 - and now i'm just going to target the
10:50 - inside uh
10:51 - in the p tags inside of that specific
10:54 - div so if we actually go
10:56 - up here in the file those two are the
10:59 - ones that i'm targeting right now
11:02 - and what i will do is i will just go
11:05 - ahead and say
11:06 - the color as a color is going to be
11:09 - gray and we are going to be using
11:14 - display grid
11:15 - because that's just more advanced right
11:18 - now
11:18 - everybody you like this playground right
11:20 - nice music somebody says nice music
11:22 - i'm just saying i'm putting up the
11:23 - comments right now okay hey now hello
11:25 - david nice
11:27 - everybody's like dance nahs let's go
11:28 - dance
11:30 - [Laughter]
11:31 - hi there not not david and i just joined
11:33 - beautiful guys
11:34 - also good to see you alvin can i build a
11:36 - full extra full local site program
11:38 - without all these github and other
11:39 - repositories standing on the far
11:41 - outside servers but only on my own
11:42 - server local of course
11:44 - so this is a question right here can i
11:46 - build a fully
11:47 - recommended but yeah you build a full
11:49 - local site program without all these
11:51 - programs
11:51 - another project and the other
11:53 - repositories standing
11:54 - on outside servers but only on my own
11:57 - server locally for sure you can do that
11:58 - but that's i wouldn't would not
12:00 - recommend that guys
12:01 - i would not recommend just putting your
12:03 - you know a server locally
12:05 - uh your app locally on your server
12:07 - there's no need to that's gonna be a lot
12:08 - of hassle that's why these servers were
12:11 - built you know all these applications
12:13 - were built for us to pull live for fiber
12:15 - is hosting
12:16 - you know to you know netlify and so
12:18 - forth right so
12:19 - again to make it easier for us because
12:21 - if you just do it for yourself yeah
12:22 - you can do it but you know this could be
12:24 - a lot of a lot of hassle a lot of work
12:26 - but if you want to do it fine you can't
12:28 - roll back in case you
12:30 - messed something up exactly next version
12:32 - so
12:33 - exactly so okay good okay let's go keep
12:35 - going david come on
12:36 - let's keep going so we we got the
12:38 - display grid part which you
12:40 - which you are a huge fan of correct yes
12:42 - very much
12:44 - and now what we will do is we will say
12:46 - grid template
12:48 - uh and columns and we will
12:52 - be you giving 14 of the full width
12:55 - of that uh p tag to the icon
12:59 - and the rest is going to be all for the
13:01 - text exactly so again
13:02 - the way it's gonna happen is what david
13:04 - is doing here guys is he's creating
13:06 - biscuit this grid right so thinking
13:07 - about it like
13:08 - every single p tag which is this tech is
13:09 - a grid correct so it's a grid
13:12 - and then he's saying okay the grid
13:13 - column is 14 is this one right here
13:16 - and then the other one is auto so it's
13:17 - going to take up as much space as i
13:19 - possibly can the rest of the space as
13:20 - hopefully that makes sense
13:22 - that's going to be the auto portion okay
13:24 - so that's basically going to be
13:25 - exactly 86 yes yes yes quick math
13:29 - right didn't use offred definitely
13:32 - nope all by yourself david right all by
13:36 - myself
13:36 - all by myself good job good math all
13:38 - right um
13:40 - next up we will be giving it a little
13:42 - bit of padding
13:44 - so that's going to be 5 pixel and then
13:46 - 25 pixel
13:49 - and what happens is
13:52 - above and below it's going to have five
13:54 - five pixels and then on both of the
13:56 - sides is going to have 25 pixels as
13:59 - padding okay that's fine that's fine so
14:02 - basically it looks good
14:03 - so five pixels is the top and the bottom
14:04 - basically top and bottom
14:06 - 25 pixels is left and right now we can't
14:09 - do that that's correct
14:10 - but we can also center it correct so
14:11 - like we can say for example the way we
14:13 - can do that is pretty simple
14:14 - i i would actually do like this david
14:16 - more so here's how i do it
14:18 - i would do like this i will say height
14:21 - let's give it a height what kind
14:22 - should we give it 30 pixels for example
14:26 - let's give it a height
14:27 - okay so let's give it a height for
14:28 - example let's remove this padding for
14:30 - now
14:32 - okay okay
14:35 - so i know i know it's fine no problem
14:37 - whatsoever
14:38 - so i'm going to give it a high let's say
14:40 - and so this for example if you inspect
14:41 - them on this one
14:43 - you can see that if i go ahead and put
14:44 - this to the right hand side
14:46 - that's fine you can see that this
14:47 - specific portion has let me go ahead and
14:49 - see
14:50 - the sp tag has a height but you can see
14:52 - there's nothing centered in that p tag
14:54 - right so here's what i'll do
14:55 - i'll center it vertically so how do we
14:56 - go and center it vertically david
14:58 - will display grid uh it's going to be
15:02 - align
15:02 - items so we'll say align items
15:05 - align items align items right there
15:09 - center boom right there center yeah so
15:12 - if we do that
15:13 - right there you see how everything's
15:13 - centered now you see how it's beautiful
15:15 - it's nicely in the center between that
15:16 - grid you see
15:17 - and so it creates just a very nice
15:18 - spacing yeah i like that i like it a lot
15:20 - and now we do and then we do instead now
15:24 - is i say
15:25 - padding left i will say padding left for
15:27 - example
15:29 - waiting left i'll give it for example
15:31 - like you know uh 25 pixels for example
15:34 - right because that's what uh no how much
15:36 - did you give padding for this one
15:37 - yeah it was 25 it was 25 was that 25
15:41 - exactly was it 25 really let me see it
15:44 - was
15:44 - let's see how much was this uh
15:48 - heading uh left yeah yeah you're right
15:50 - 525 pixels that's right
15:51 - it just seems a bit odd that's why it
15:53 - just seems like the meat is like not you
15:55 - know where it should be
15:56 - but i guess maybe that's just my my
15:58 - weird
15:59 - i think we could we could add a little
16:00 - bit of uh
16:02 - bottom margin to the title maybe
16:05 - just to fix that up that's true we can
16:07 - do a little body margin so we could do
16:08 - is
16:09 - let's go to the title do margin bottom
16:11 - right there beautiful
16:12 - margin body how much do that give it
16:14 - let's give it like i would say let's
16:15 - give it like three pixels
16:17 - okay three pixels yeah good cool good so
16:20 - let's go ahead that will push that a
16:21 - little to this a little bit to the
16:22 - bottom
16:23 - let me see did we save that save that
16:26 - yeah
16:27 - let me see did it actually push it
16:28 - though it did it did it
16:30 - very lightly very lightly very lightly
16:32 - and then what i would actually see is
16:34 - i'd actually make you also margin top a
16:35 - little bit here let's do this
16:36 - margin top margin top on this one
16:41 - margin top on this one's going to be
16:42 - also let me put this aside
16:44 - margin type is going to be around 4
16:49 - one right pixels so you see how spaced
16:51 - out a little bit better now we can even
16:52 - do probably let's try eight boot
16:53 - actually let's try this
16:54 - eight pixels boom
16:57 - a little bit better now i would say so
16:59 - what do you think about that a little
17:00 - bit better now huh what do you think
17:01 - about that
17:02 - yeah yeah i mean it you definitely gave
17:04 - it a little bit of room to breathe
17:06 - i know right
17:12 - it's always good when you got room to
17:13 - breathe david right i mean it's not bad
17:15 - definitely
17:16 - yeah yeah yeah exactly so we got that
17:18 - portion okay and even even the coolest
17:20 - part what i can do for example you see
17:21 - oh there's a meat wrapper
17:22 - and there's a meat meat it just sounds
17:26 - like meat you know
17:27 - i just think it's funny so the meat
17:29 - rapper this whole
17:30 - rapper by the way this whole wrapper
17:32 - right
17:33 - we can actually use it as a whole
17:35 - there's a display almost like a display
17:37 - flex actually fully full on um i would
17:40 - actually full check this out
17:42 - to make this meat meat wrapper all the
17:44 - way at the bottom
17:45 - i just think it's funny to make this
17:47 - video wrapper all at the bottom what i
17:48 - would do is the following actually i
17:50 - would actually make this display
17:51 - let me see just to try something out if
17:53 - now we can always do later okay
17:54 - so we can also have the hangouts wrapper
17:56 - so i would actually
17:58 - put them into your div and then move
18:00 - them yeah yeah yeah exactly
18:01 - so how about this let's do the hangouts
18:03 - wrapper then we can figure out the rest
18:04 - stuff so let's go ahead and continue on
18:05 - so we got the meat wrapper guys here
18:07 - it's pretty clean i would say so i kind
18:09 - of like it i mean i don't i don't
18:11 - i like it a lot right here so it's all
18:13 - good
18:14 - let's go ahead and do the hangouts
18:15 - wrapper which is basically this portion
18:17 - right here
18:18 - let's do that actually i just saw a
18:22 - a thing that we can do to make the app
18:25 - a little bit more optimized instead of
18:28 - using meat
18:29 - wrapper and hangouts wrapper we could
18:32 - use
18:32 - sidebar section wrapper and
18:36 - we could literally give the same exact
18:38 - same styling for the two
18:40 - what do you say because because icons
18:42 - and texts
18:43 - i just saw this but oh you wanna you
18:46 - wanna have like a parent that has the
18:47 - same
18:48 - exact styling kind of like that okay
18:52 - let's do it
18:53 - do it do it do it okay that's it so
18:57 - instead of meat wrapper we will say
19:01 - i just came up with this though that's
19:02 - fine good good good bar
19:04 - section wrapper like this this is how
19:07 - you optimize stuff right
19:08 - yeah boom right there too
19:12 - good okay and instead of meet wrapper
19:15 - scroll down
19:16 - and then just we will rename it
19:20 - and then we can remove that thing which
19:23 - is looking clean
19:24 - so far again and the reason why he's
19:26 - doing that guys is because you can see
19:27 - here
19:28 - that this meat wrapper and this hanging
19:31 - rubber they look very much similar they
19:32 - just have different content
19:34 - and different type but that's pretty
19:35 - much it
19:37 - exactly and what we can do is again just
19:40 - give
19:40 - give the same title and then
19:44 - do a p tag okay good
19:47 - and now we need to import another icon
19:51 - which is going to be the account circle
19:53 - icon
19:55 - um right there on the top
19:58 - cool and we will be using that so in the
20:01 - p tag
20:02 - we can say
20:06 - so the pdf we can say things like for
20:07 - example guys
20:09 - so you can have what we're trying to
20:10 - type here is yeah
20:12 - one is going to be the account circle
20:14 - icon which is this one right here
20:16 - and then he's going to type in divergosi
20:17 - right here go ahead
20:19 - exactly sophie now save this portion
20:23 - right there look at that see guys it's
20:24 - so simple right very very simple and now
20:27 - you can have this
20:28 - all the way underneath that specific
20:29 - section that's awesome yeah beautiful
20:32 - beautiful beautiful awesome
20:34 - that's pretty good dang i just saw this
20:36 - i mean we could even go a little
20:38 - further hold on let's hold on david i
20:41 - know you're excited
20:42 - okay i know you're excited i'm excited
20:44 - too well that's i want us to move on
20:47 - okay let's move on let's move on let's
20:49 - move on ah i just want to
20:51 - get all excited he's like oh my god code
20:53 - yes i can optimize
20:56 - all right so next up what we will do is
20:59 - we will have the bottom icons wrapper
21:02 - okay so which is this one right here at
21:03 - the bottom
21:05 - which is this red paper
21:10 - yep and for that what we will do is we
21:13 - will need another
21:14 - data helper file so i'm just going to go
21:16 - ahead and create a
21:18 - bottom icons data dot js in the
21:22 - data folder so he's doing it right here
21:25 - you see guys
21:26 - he just created a bottom bottom icons
21:30 - uh data.gs and he's doing it because he
21:32 - doesn't want to you know manually write
21:34 - uh
21:34 - you know create these icons he kind of
21:36 - wants to define the object for these
21:38 - icons just like so right here at the
21:39 - bottom
21:40 - and then that will allow him to just
21:42 - loop through them you can loop through
21:43 - them really easily
21:44 - and then you can just simply you know
21:46 - show them using react.js so let's go
21:48 - ahead and do that right now
21:50 - exactly perfect so well
21:53 - we will be pretty much doing the exact
21:55 - same stuff that we did above
21:56 - with inbox star so
22:00 - what we will do now is we will have
22:02 - first a person icon
22:04 - good on the top and we will be importing
22:07 - it from
22:08 - the material ui
22:13 - ui icons
22:17 - i mean yeah you could you could pretty
22:19 - yeah exactly that nice good
22:21 - keep going keep going person god
22:24 - beautiful
22:24 - like that nice and of course we have
22:27 - other icons like the phone icon
22:28 - and the phone the format for my quota
22:31 - icon again
22:32 - all these comp guys from here okay so
22:34 - phone icon like for example here
22:36 - one right there see boom right there so
22:37 - we will have the four format quote and
22:40 - the phone icon
22:40 - as well and we will just go ahead and
22:43 - create
22:44 - a what's it called it's going to be an
22:46 - array
22:47 - and we will be exporting it as a module
22:49 - so what we will say is export const
22:52 - and bottom icons equals
22:56 - ray boom and we would just pretty much
22:58 - just go through these so
23:00 - let's just create them icon boom
23:03 - uh format quote
23:07 - icon so nice so if somebody says this if
23:10 - you use react
23:11 - router dom guys so you don't need to use
23:13 - react router down just yet because
23:15 - there's not many pages we don't have
23:17 - many different pages guys okay
23:18 - right react right or down you would use
23:21 - when for example you want to you have
23:22 - when you have multiple pages when you
23:24 - have one page and a second page like
23:26 - there's really no need to use a react
23:28 - router down in this case
23:29 - so you have to be very careful what do
23:31 - you use and what do you not use
23:33 - it's not just about using the most
23:34 - fanciest components the most fanciest
23:36 - names no
23:37 - it's about making it functional
23:39 - i'm sorry make it functional and make it
23:41 - work
23:41 - that's the most important thing all
23:43 - these fancy names simple as possible
23:45 - yeah all these kinds of names well they
23:46 - will come later
23:47 - when you get to the workplace guys it's
23:49 - very simple what can you do in the
23:51 - simplest manner as possible
23:53 - and that's it that's all they're going
23:54 - to look for okay just so you know
23:56 - all right go ahead keep going all right
23:58 - cool
23:59 - so that's pretty much the bottom icons
24:02 - data file right there and you can see
24:04 - it's pretty simple he just created an
24:05 - array
24:05 - like so and he the cool part is an array
24:08 - you can actually include the icons
24:09 - themselves
24:10 - and then you can loop through the array
24:12 - loop through this array
24:13 - and then just go one by one just be like
24:15 - okay show this one this one and then
24:17 - this one
24:18 - good go ahead exactly and and the reason
24:21 - why i actually like to keep these
24:24 - separately is because then it's so
24:28 - it it's just easier to look at whether
24:30 - if i could just
24:31 - i could literally put it in the sidebar
24:34 - the js file
24:35 - but then it just it would be the whole
24:37 - file would be so big
24:39 - exactly and it's already not that yeah
24:42 - it's really big as this
24:43 - so can i actually can i actually do this
24:44 - one right now can i i'm very sure yeah
24:46 - yeah go ahead okay so let me remove this
24:48 - portion okay
24:49 - so guys check this out guys okay so what
24:52 - we are going to do is we're going to go
24:54 - ahead and import part one it's going to
24:55 - import the bottoms uh
24:57 - wrapper so we'll do import import
25:00 - import and we'll do bottom icons
25:04 - bottom icons yeah but you wanna you
25:06 - wanna
25:07 - give it uh squiggly brace because i
25:10 - didn't
25:10 - export default defaults okay so bottom
25:13 - icons
25:14 - bottom icons like this bottom icons
25:18 - right there from from where we're going
25:21 - to import from where
25:22 - well from the bottom icons data you can
25:24 - see here bottom icons data right
25:26 - and to get there we're currently in a
25:28 - sidebar section right so we need to come
25:29 - out of layout
25:30 - and we need to go to data so that means
25:32 - you do dot dash to come on a layout
25:35 - then that will give me back to for
25:36 - example then
25:38 - uh no actually i need to go back to data
25:40 - let me see and to come out of that too
25:42 - you need to go out of components as well
25:44 - and go into data
25:46 - and then you can see i can do the bottom
25:47 - icons data right here just like this
25:49 - and so now like if i can save this this
25:51 - will actually give me access to this
25:53 - specific
25:54 - to the bottom icons right here these
25:56 - ones okay
25:57 - and then what i will do is in order for
25:59 - us to actually fully loop through them
26:01 - we'll just do a dot map right so what i
26:04 - will do is i will go
26:05 - up and open up my brackets and i will
26:06 - say bottom icons
26:09 - bottom icons right like so icons
26:12 - right dot map okay right there
26:16 - and then the map always has one item so
26:18 - let's do item
26:19 - okay and that leads us to what leads us
26:22 - to
26:22 - the actual icon so here's will do we'll
26:24 - do like this
26:25 - boom and then what's going to happen now
26:28 - at this point is we'll say
26:29 - okay let's do the actual icon so we'll
26:31 - say like this
26:33 - we'll say it
26:34 - [Music]
26:36 - boom check this out so this right here
26:39 - is actually really interesting
26:41 - this right here you ever seen this is
26:42 - you ever seen this david
26:44 - oh hell yeah yeah it's like a deal it's
26:46 - like a day but it's an empty day of
26:47 - almost oh it's like almost like
26:49 - such not there right and then we'll do
26:51 - is we'll do icon like so
26:53 - so we'll do the not item also icon so
26:56 - let me
26:56 - let me get this icon right here and this
26:58 - should be an icon as well okay
27:00 - so if i save this now let's go take a
27:01 - look what do we get if i save that
27:03 - okay so we got that portion are you
27:05 - ready bro oh
27:06 - not showing up let's go refresh this oh
27:09 - it's right there you can see
27:11 - except it's very badly laid out
27:14 - you can see right so i mean it's pretty
27:17 - good over there i like it there
27:18 - i like it you like it there okay perfect
27:21 - we're done thank you guys so much
27:22 - for watching we'll have you guys have a
27:23 - great day i'm just kidding i'm just
27:25 - kidding guys
27:26 - um all right so that's kind of there of
27:28 - course but let's go ahead and do the
27:29 - following things well the one thing i
27:31 - want to do is i want to center them
27:32 - because you can see that
27:33 - in our finished clone if they are
27:35 - centered correct david right here
27:36 - they're centered right correct
27:38 - so let's go ahead and center them to
27:39 - center them we'll need to go back to
27:40 - bottom under the
27:41 - icons wrapper there's a really cool
27:43 - extension not a close tension or
27:45 - shortcut you can use
27:46 - if i hit if i hold command or i think i
27:48 - think
27:49 - on windows if i hold ctrl and i click
27:52 - look at that it will take me
27:53 - straight to the style.div boom right
27:55 - there you could just use f12
27:57 - button or after oh there might be right
27:59 - and now i can actually edit my icons
28:01 - wrapper that they have like so
28:02 - so to make it for example to let's say i
28:05 - want to i want to you know center it you
28:06 - know fully
28:07 - i can do let's just use for example
28:09 - display flex right now i think that's
28:10 - completely fine would you say david
28:13 - we can display facts as it is so let's
28:15 - display flex display
28:18 - because you can use display flex and
28:19 - display grid all together so say display
28:21 - flex
28:22 - okay and then to align something
28:24 - horizontally what we do is we do align
28:25 - items now do justify content
28:27 - justify content right there content
28:31 - center boom right there okay so if i
28:34 - save this now let's go back to here
28:36 - boom you can see now this is all fully
28:37 - centered just like so right here boom
28:39 - see right there standard because of the
28:41 - justified content center
28:42 - very very very simple understood david
28:45 - understood understood
28:47 - okay awesome guys we are coming at 198
28:51 - 198 likes can we get to 200 likes
28:55 - and then we'll do a happening dance it's
28:58 - a party
28:58 - the party up in here 198 let's go and
29:01 - smash that like button guys
29:02 - share this video guys with everybody as
29:04 - you can see right
29:05 - this gets it out to as many people as
29:07 - possible most people just smash the like
29:08 - button because then that tells youtube
29:10 - okay great they're doing some valuable
29:12 - content that's the only way they know
29:14 - that

29:34 - yes you will all right so now the
29:38 - question becomes guys is very simple
29:39 - okay
29:40 - the question becomes is how do we move
29:42 - this
29:43 - this to the bottom david how to move
29:45 - this to the bottom
29:50 - i would use position absolutely
29:54 - i will use something different but i
29:56 - think what you have you're on a good
29:58 - path
29:58 - but i'll actually do something different
30:01 - what would you use
30:02 - okay i would actually use display flex
30:06 - uh-huh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
30:09 - yeah
30:10 - the display flash for the rescue but how
30:12 - is the question guys
30:14 - check this out the way we can do it is
30:15 - pretty pretty simple right
30:17 - what we can do is we can how about this
30:19 - how about we wrap this whole thing with
30:22 - display already
30:40 - [Music]

34:21 -  what
34:25 - nope i got it we'll do like this justify
34:27 - content
34:28 - we'll do just the contest space between
34:31 - that's as simple as that that's
34:32 - it here's what we'll do okay i'll go to

34:56 - i'm close
34:56 - i'm close i'm closer this is what
34:58 - happens when you mess up my code
35:00 - i know let me remove this for a second
35:03 - here
35:04 - let me see
35:09 - now how do i align something at the
35:11 - bottom all at the bottom i mean what i
35:12 - can do the best way to do this is just
35:15 - to line it all at the bottom is okay i
35:18 - mean
35:19 - hold on again if you use the display
35:21 - grid
35:22 - no i'll do this okay i got it i got it
35:23 - again
35:25 - so here's what we'll do we'll do row

35:42 - section wrapper right here beautiful
35:44 - that's awesome and so now we have two
35:46 - items okay
35:47 - now we have two things two things now
35:50 - okay one at the top one the bottom
35:51 - beautiful all right
35:52 - top section wrapper that's amazing okay
35:55 - what's going to happen now
35:56 - is we're going to create a div for top
35:58 - section wrapper as well
36:00 - right here so const const
36:04 - top section wrapper boom it's also going
36:07 - to be style.div
36:09 - boom boom okay save that all right
36:11 - awesome so check this out now
36:13 - now my question is why does it why do we
36:16 - let me stop you for one second what's up
36:17 - bro
36:18 - we got our first donation i think oh we
36:20 - did where
36:22 - yes we did
36:28 - hold on hold on hold the phone
36:31 - you are amazing where is this
36:36 - chandra like a what is 100 rupees is
36:39 - that what it is
36:40 - hey hey everybody my name is chandra and
36:42 - i just tried your whatsapp clone and
36:44 - it's awesome and now
36:45 - and now is time for jimmy clone let's
36:47 - rock and roll you know it hey
36:49 - exactly oh my god
36:54 - [Music]
37:00 - all right keep going awesome so a few
37:04 - things okay
37:05 - few things really quickly thank you so
37:07 - much i appreciate you all right so good
37:08 - vibes only that's true that's true
37:10 - that's true okay guys so we got that
37:11 - portion okay
37:12 - somebody somebody actually made a
37:13 - comment let me see somebody made a
37:14 - really cool comment
37:15 - let me set justify contest space between
37:17 - to the rapper hi guys yes
37:18 - align stuff to the child exactly so
37:20 - that's what i'm trying to do here right
37:21 - so
37:22 - while we have two wrappers now one big
37:23 - issue that i'm seeing here is for
37:24 - example for some reason
37:26 - it's being it's pushing the whole dip
37:28 - why i'm not sure why this whole div is
37:29 - being pushed
37:30 - all the way to the bottom do you see
37:32 - what i mean here
37:33 - like it's creating more space than what
37:35 - needs to do do you stand there
37:37 - oh actually i know what that's the case
37:38 - i know i have like two rappers
37:41 - bottom rapper top rapper and then space
37:43 - between
37:44 - i know that's the case that could work i
37:46 - know that's the kids because the reason
37:47 - why that's i guess because we have a
37:48 - height of 100
37:49 - vh right see right here so the height of
37:51 - 100 h is what's causing this
37:53 - sidebar to actually go past and this
37:55 - what's causing this
37:57 - um scroll wheel right right because if
38:00 - we when you slide the side with 100 of
38:01 - each it's actually going to be
38:02 - this plus the whole height right
38:05 - exactly so what we need to do is we need
38:07 - to do is hide 100 vh
38:09 - minus turn this out minus we'll do calc
38:12 - yeah yeah check this out guys this is
38:14 - really cool 100 vh
38:15 - minus what is the height of the header
38:16 - do you know
38:18 - i think it's like 70 70 pixels something
38:22 - someone let me see let me see let me
38:23 - look at look it up
38:25 - uh yes it's 70 pixels is 90 pixels
38:28 - i think it's like i think it's 100
38:30 - pixels no
38:32 - i think it is i think it's cool i'd say
38:33 - i think it's i think it's less than 70
38:35 - pixels let me see
38:36 - look it up it's 71 bro header.js
38:39 - it's 71 pixels okay
38:43 - maybe it's 72 let me see 72 73
38:46 - 24 25.
38:50 - okay all right so calc we'll do calc so
38:54 - for the height of the sidebar we'll do
38:56 - calc let me see where's the sidebar
38:57 - right here side by side where's the
38:59 - height of the sidebar where is it where
39:00 - is it where is it
39:01 - where is it was it right here so we'll
39:03 - do 100 vh
39:05 - we'll do a calc boom
39:08 - right there so kind of we're almost
39:11 - there 77
39:12 - what i don't know why it's still not i
39:15 - don't think it's 77
39:17 - i think it's more than 77 i think it's
39:18 - 80 let's try 80.
39:21 - no bro like what went back to header.js
39:24 - huh let's just say any pixels okay fine
39:26 - it's any pixels how about that
39:28 - okay fine 70 pixels now you can see it
39:30 - we still have like a little bit of
39:32 - scroll which i don't fully like
39:34 - but i think the reason why is pretty
39:36 - simple because
39:38 - um well we can figure it out here in a
39:39 - little bit i think most importantly is
39:41 - here's what i want to do i'll go to the
39:42 - wrappers i want to do this i want to say
39:44 - justify content
39:45 - justify content content and then say
39:48 - space between
39:51 - space dash between
39:55 - boom boom right there you see now yes
39:58 - it's hiding all the to the bottom here
39:59 - but that's completely fine that's not a
40:01 - problem we'll do we can just do margin
40:02 - bottom that's that's all
40:03 - we can do right we don't have to do that
40:06 - at all so let me go ahead let me just
40:07 - say this
40:09 - oh see it's not changing at all that's
40:11 - beautiful that's exactly what what i
40:12 - want in here
40:13 - so here's what i'll do i'll do i'll do
40:17 - margin bottom margin bottom
40:23 - how much well how much should we do
40:28 - boom i don't know five pixels hmm
40:32 - it's not even doing that let me see a
40:33 - wrapper
40:35 - oh i think margin bottom on the actual
40:37 - bottom portion let me see margin bottom
40:38 - on
40:39 - the the bottom section so we'll do top
40:42 - section and then the bottom section div
40:44 - we'll do margin bundle for this one
40:46 - there we go
40:47 - oh 100 by 10 pixels hey you see now
40:50 - there you go beautiful
40:51 - how was that okay how's that how's that
40:53 - looking
40:55 - looking good let's do 20 pixels maybe
40:56 - it's a little bit different than what i
40:57 - would do but
40:59 - it's good just it's just as good though
41:03 - hey 30 pixels let's try this one
41:06 - beautiful see i like that now you see
41:07 - now the reason why i like this
41:08 - because then this will always be on the
41:10 - bottom it's not like whenever the thing
41:12 - is
41:12 - i always try to avoid relative
41:14 - positioning i always try to use like the
41:15 - top 300 pixels or bottom 300 pixels
41:18 - i try to avoid write the positioning
41:19 - because that changes things you know
41:21 - what i mean
41:21 - and so that's all that's why we do this
41:23 - got it
41:24 - yeah cool beans all right let's go and
41:26 - continue on with
41:28 - what you need to finish up for this
41:30 - specific portion
41:32 - so we need to give it a color
41:36 - yes and we need to give it like a little
41:37 - bit of room to breathe
41:39 - okay and a border top okay and
41:42 - we're pretty much sad let's do it right
41:44 - now you ready bro
41:46 - i am okay where's the color you go you
41:48 - go now
41:50 - uh so the color that we want to give it
41:52 - is green
41:53 - okay so gray let's go go ahead
41:57 - yep go go go go go gray where is it i
42:00 - don't know how to do your target because
42:02 - what's up go keep going keep going nice
42:07 - i'm not sure how do you want to target
42:09 - this empty div
42:11 - thing that you gave in simple here's
42:14 - what we do we got the
42:15 - is like unwrapper bro and we'll say
42:17 - color yeah
42:18 - color what is the color it's gray
42:21 - grey is it just gray really it's really
42:25 - just gray
42:25 - yeah right there now you see this bro
42:28 - it's gray now right there see let's go
42:30 - and see let's go ahead and add a border
42:32 - top as well
42:34 - exactly and that's going to be a one
42:36 - pixel
42:38 - solid and it's going to be light gray
42:41 - i told you right now boom let's do it
42:45 - let's do let's do it do it
42:46 - what a top beautiful let's go ahead and
42:48 - save that awesome save that
42:49 - and boom look at that now one thing you
42:52 - guys can see
42:53 - as you can see here what we have is we
42:55 - have some space in
42:57 - what can we do bro okay i mean
43:01 - i would just do a simple margin top or
43:04 - actually i would do better even try
43:07 - margin top you'll see a big difference
43:09 - here let's try margin top
43:10 - okay do margin top do like 20 let's say
43:14 - 20 pixels okay now this is challenging
43:17 - me guys i am challenging you
43:19 - save it let's see okay i got it cool
43:23 - okay do do now 30 pixels
43:27 - okay do more
43:31 - hey we have another donation
43:34 - let's go we do
43:38 - another donation
43:41 - also chandra hey guys chandra again so
43:43 - appreciate you work this again
43:44 - for your hard work a regular view
43:46 - remember me thank you so much
43:48 - tech coder is her name i love it that's
43:51 - awesome
43:52 - that's amazing that's so awesome cool
43:55 - cool cool
43:56 - awesome sweet all right let's go ahead
43:57 - keep going
43:59 - okay one second uh let me just quickly
44:01 - mend the chat for
44:02 - one second because we have a ton of spam
44:05 - happening in here
44:07 - and i just cleaned it up cool so
44:10 - yeah i gave it 30 pixels of margin top
44:15 - what are you going to do about it
44:17 - actually it looks pretty good so never
44:19 - [Laughter]
44:20 - mind
44:22 - okay and how about that i want to give
44:26 - a little bit of space between those
44:29 - uh icons what do you say about that okay
44:32 - let's do it which space where space yeah
44:34 - let's do that spice
44:35 - some spacing so now this is
44:39 - this is when the fun fun begins because
44:42 - how do you target those icons
44:44 - that's a good question that's a good
44:45 - question let me see what we could do
44:47 - what we could do
44:48 - is we let's say mui svg
44:52 - icon root which is the default
44:56 - um class name for every
44:59 - material ui icon because you can see
45:01 - it's here that's right here so you guys
45:03 - exactly
45:04 - m-u-i-s-g icon root is every single icon
45:06 - that we create and it has a class of you
45:08 - record i'm usvg icon
45:09 - we could target that inside here so
45:12 - easily right
45:13 - so if we target let's go ahead and add
45:14 - some padding left putting right david
45:16 - patting left heading right
45:21 - okay let's see it let's see it let's see
45:25 - don't do doing doing good so i targeted
45:27 - that and
45:28 - okay beautiful and i gave it a padding
45:30 - of two pixels beautiful
45:32 - so hey let's go
45:35 - that looks good the job done bro that
45:37 - looks good we have a patty of two pixels
45:39 - right here
45:39 - okay but right there that's pretty clean
45:42 - one thing that is let's do i would add
45:43 - maybe 40 pixels to this one margin top
45:46 - maybe let's do 60 pixels just maybe
45:48 - maybe
45:50 - yeah now it's all good and you can see
45:52 - now we've got what we needed
45:53 - and just look at this how good look at
45:55 - how cool this is the cool part about
45:56 - this is that
45:57 - because this is not depending on
45:58 - position reality you see you see this
46:00 - david
46:02 - you see this you see how nicely it works
46:04 - i see your point you see my point now
46:07 - i see you see how good it is
46:15 - all right awesome let's go ahead and
46:16 - keep going guys alright so what's the
46:18 - next portion david tell me
46:20 - all right so next up i want to address
46:23 - the very far right
46:25 - of the application and that's going to
46:27 - be side icons like js
46:33 - so good so good yes exactly so
46:37 - in here it's going to be the simplest
46:40 - possible
46:40 - ever uh
46:44 - what do you say component it's like 40
46:46 - lines so
46:47 - really not that not that crazy but uh
46:51 - as we usually did with styled components
46:53 - what we would say
46:54 - is import styled from
46:58 - styled components
47:03 - components cool and
47:06 - we will have to import one icon if you
47:09 - actually
47:10 - can highlight the very low uh
47:13 - or the the icon at the bottom
47:16 - that's a little plus icon holy moly we
47:18 - have another donation bro
47:22 - attack tag
47:25 - you guys are rocking when you call me
47:27 - hey her
47:30 - call me her i was like i'm a boy oh okay
47:32 - okay gotcha i mean i don't know
47:36 - all right keep going all right cool and
47:38 - um
47:40 - so what i definitely want to import that
47:42 - so that's going to be the ad
47:43 - icon um okay that we will import from
47:47 - material ui icons again what we're
47:49 - working on guys now is this specific
47:51 - portion right here you can see this
47:52 - portion
47:53 - so he's working on this icon for example
47:55 - right now like this right here
47:57 - and it's also gonna work on this icon
47:58 - this blue one and this blue one and this
48:00 - blue one and so forth okay
48:03 - yes correct so now what i will do
48:06 - is uh let's set up all the
48:09 - wrappers and stuff so we will have the
48:12 - wrapper
48:13 - that's good and now it's going to freak
48:16 - out a little
48:17 - so let's actually say const rapper
48:22 - god styled
48:26 - div beautiful beautiful beautiful which
48:28 - is amazing
48:29 - and now once again we are going to be
48:33 - using display grid
48:37 - let's actually uh put in all the stuff
48:40 - that we will have
48:40 - so what i went ahead and did is actually
48:43 - if you go back to the
48:44 - uh finished version of the application
48:46 - okay
48:48 - we have the google keep the google
48:52 - calendar no the calendar the google keep
48:54 - the google tasks
48:56 - and the google contacts icons beautiful
48:58 - so what i did is basically i just
49:00 - searched them up on google
49:02 - and then copy address or image address
49:05 - and then just
49:06 - put it in an image source okay okay okay
49:11 - so what we can we can do is like i'm
49:14 - pretty much just copying it
49:16 - uh i have this snippet ready so
49:19 - we can we can pretty much say this if
49:21 - you put it into the comments section of
49:23 - youtube yeah i can like yeah exactly
49:26 - copy that right now put in the comment
49:28 - section on youtube yeah exactly i like
49:29 - that yeah
49:30 - yes you can see what we've done here
49:31 - right now is if i go ahead and save this
49:33 - portion now
49:34 - hey oh look how good this is these are
49:37 - some epic icons though look at this
49:40 - let's go let's go so while you're
49:42 - copying go ahead so while you're copying
49:44 - the icons and putting into
49:46 - the thing let's go i'll take a look at
49:48 - how do we actually
49:49 - make this wrapper work do properly okay
49:51 - so go on copy paste icons
49:53 - now okay of course now currently of
49:54 - course this div on the right-hand side
49:56 - is broken pretty much guys
49:57 - as you can see correct no yo we got
49:59 - another donation from tech coders
50:02 - holy moly how many dishes can we get
50:05 - last donation i promise thanks so much
50:10 - thank you so much thank you so much all
50:12 - right okay so here's
50:13 - what's going to happen guys right if we
50:15 - go have and have these images right here
50:17 - correct we have these images right here
50:19 - what's going to happen is the following
50:21 - we need to make them
50:22 - kind of align vertically correct so
50:24 - vertically like so
50:26 - now the whole thing the whole thing if i
50:28 - go ahead and take a look at if i go
50:30 - ahead and put my thing at the bottom
50:32 - our whole section right section which is
50:35 - this section
50:36 - which is the main section is created of
50:38 - two grids
50:40 - right two grid components you can see
50:41 - here right we have one
50:44 - one two three at the right hand side one
50:47 - two
50:48 - three one two three one two three now we
50:50 - just now need to make it fit
50:52 - fully fully now to make that fit i said
50:54 - to say display grid
50:56 - display grid right here good okay
50:59 - display grid
50:59 - beautiful and with display glitch you're
51:02 - starting up
51:03 - now we'll do a display grid let me
51:05 - remove our
51:06 - uh our faces for a second here so we'll
51:09 - do grid
51:10 - grid dash template create this template
51:13 - dash rows
51:14 - right and of course now let's think
51:17 - about what rows do we want to use
51:19 - what we want to do the reason why we
51:22 - want to do
51:23 - these we want to do the following role
51:24 - so check this out well
51:26 - how many icons do we currently have well
51:28 - we have if you think about this
51:29 - we have what one two three how much one
51:33 - two three four so four icons
51:36 - to make it fully work here's what we'll
51:38 - do we'll do repeat
51:42 - repeat right there repeat
51:45 - right there four comma what
51:48 - four comma 50 pixels meaning the height
51:52 - of every single thing is gonna be 50
51:53 - pixels max look at this
51:55 - if i save this now all right let's go
51:58 - ahead and save this
51:58 - let's refresh this and it's not working
52:01 - which is beautiful
52:02 - beautiful beautiful that's amazing
52:04 - here's the thing the reason why it's not
52:05 - working is pretty simple
52:07 - here's here's why our grid now yes is
52:10 - you see you can see our grid now i mean
52:11 - the rows
52:12 - are working the rows aren't working no
52:14 - problem look at that one two
52:16 - three and so forth the rows are working
52:17 - no problem whatsoever right
52:19 - what's now working is what is the actual
52:23 - divs the actual images so we need to fix
52:26 - the image
52:26 - to fix the image you just need to go the
52:28 - image and we need to say the following
52:33 - image and what we're going to say is
52:35 - okay
52:36 - image width right here width
52:40 - okay and a hundred percent because if we
52:42 - say the width of a hundred percent
52:44 - this means that boom right there
52:47 - is what this means okay that's exactly
52:50 - what this means
52:51 - you can see now and now this image you
52:53 - can see is very simple
52:55 - it's just simply the max width of the
52:58 - width
52:59 - of the full container right and that's
53:01 - going to prevent it from
53:02 - going down or from you know uh from
53:05 - having all these weird things now
53:07 - what daily the added here is he added an
53:10 - hr
53:10 - and hit an ad icon which is here at the
53:12 - bottom boom right there so we have one
53:15 - and two and we need to be able to modify
53:18 - this the grid to accommodate those
53:21 - hopefully you guys understand that right
53:22 - we said there's four items but now
53:24 - there's six items okay
53:26 - so we go and take a look at this what's
53:27 - going to happen david well well
53:29 - let's go ahead for the hr which is
53:31 - simply one horizontal line we'll say one
53:32 - pixel
53:34 - okay and then the rest is going to be 50
53:36 - pixels
53:39 - save that save that beautiful let's go
53:42 - and refresh this
53:43 - oh okay so
53:46 - here's what happens now that's awesome
53:48 - that's all great
53:50 - for the images let me take a look at the
53:52 - grid right now
53:54 - how does the grid look like oh look at
53:55 - this right there look at this oh so the
53:57 - reason why now that's the case is
53:59 - because why david
54:00 - why did why is it that this place items
54:03 - is
54:03 - spreading this whole thing out over the
54:06 - whole width why
54:07 - tell me david why you know why i mean i
54:10 - think uh
54:11 - we need to just pass it on the top i
54:14 - guess
54:14 - [Music]
54:16 - so that that's what that would be my my
54:18 - my
54:19 - well i guess i think why it's because
54:21 - you have the place item center
54:23 - i will say place items place items
54:27 - center yeah but that's not going to work
54:30 - either let's see
54:32 - dad ain't working david hold on do you
54:35 - know why
54:37 - i know why uh i think
54:40 - those image things are a little bigger
54:43 - than uh
54:44 - than 50 pixels i i would i would
54:48 - do i would hide in like
54:52 - 20 pixels or something
54:55 - which is ah that's not the reason why
54:57 - they're that's not the reason why
54:58 - they're breaking david
54:59 - but let's try it
55:02 - i know it's david i know it david david
55:06 - trust me i know it you sure yes you can
55:08 - see right there
55:09 - i would do object fit contain too okay
55:11 - that's fine you can do that too
55:14 - all right same thing oh yeah look at
55:16 - that it's smaller now which is great
55:18 - okay
55:24 - i mean we still need to snap all the ah
55:26 - we we might need to just add an
55:28 - auto here let's see what that does
55:33 - save that no nope
55:36 - here nope i think it's all because of
55:38 - the place items
55:41 - it could be okay i think that's why
55:44 - i think it's all because of place items
55:45 - okay and if grid does not work i know
55:48 - how to make it work very simply display
55:49 - flex by the way
55:56 - okay go ahead okay keep going
55:59 - go go
56:04 - guys that's all that's amazing so here's
56:06 - what's going to happen now to make this
56:07 - work you see place item center
56:09 - well look instead of placing let's do i
56:12 - think it's place items so
56:13 - if you look at display grid display grid
56:16 - yeah we'll get them liquid items
56:20 - place items let's actually just remove
56:23 - that line and see what that does
56:26 - why is it spreading it out that's crazy
56:29 - you can see
56:30 - that there is auto well the center
56:32 - stretch there's start right here this is
56:33 - what we want i actually want
56:34 - start is what i want the place to items
56:37 - for but this product is shorthand for
56:38 - the following css properties align items
56:40 - and justify justify items
56:41 - so what i want to do instead everyone is
56:43 - assembled just want to do start so let's
56:45 - try to start
56:45 - one right there since i place items
56:47 - we'll do start
56:49 - start okay that makes sense okay still
56:52 - not it
56:53 - huh why is this not it david oh come on
56:56 - grid template did i say dim plumber rose
56:59 - properly yeah i did right
57:00 - for oh because i think i i think i
57:03 - spelled repeat wrong
57:05 - i didn't actually uh so we repeat let's
57:08 - go
57:09 - now i got it what happened i i had
57:11 - repeated
57:13 - oh hey that's what i'm talking about
57:18 - okay it's not working i'm gonna bug the
57:21 - center now
57:23 - there we go i knew
57:27 - i knew it too trust me just you know
57:28 - cool
57:32 - oh that's funny that's funny that's
57:34 - funny okay cool
57:35 - so we have this icon so you can see and
57:38 - one thing i don't like is the fact that
57:39 - these icons like
57:40 - okay our icons currently are not spread
57:42 - out evenly are they spread out spread
57:44 - out evenly are they or no
57:45 - i feel like they are right they they
57:48 - should be
57:48 - cause because we we place them center
57:52 - so they should be both vertically and
57:54 - horizontally centered let's do this now
57:56 - let's go ahead and make a
57:57 - make up what border left now because we
57:59 - need to create this border left right
58:00 - here at the bottom here
58:01 - so let's do that right now yeah or left
58:04 - is going to be the way for us to go
58:07 - exactly so what we'll say is just uh
58:09 - going to be a border
58:11 - dash left fit
58:14 - cool and we will say it's going to be
58:17 - the usual one pixel solid
58:18 - and light gray okay beautiful boom right
58:21 - there awesome
58:22 - so let's go and save that that's gonna
58:25 - be beautiful
58:27 - okay all right so save that okay oh
58:31 - look at how good this looks and honestly
58:33 - i kind of like it without the borders oh
58:35 - i kind of like even without this border
58:36 - right here
58:38 - i mean i like it better that way but
58:42 - that's not how google likes it no i like
58:44 - this let's we'll make it better than
58:45 - google does i like it better than google
58:47 - okay
58:47 - that's fine so cool i like this plus
58:50 - icon i like everything that's here
58:52 - that's amazing okay let's now go ahead
58:54 - and work on which portion
58:56 - ah we still need to we we have we have
58:58 - two things we need to
59:00 - uh finish up what so what uh
59:04 - one we have to give uh so
59:07 - if you actually go to the original gmail
59:10 - notice that
59:11 - above the plus icon the hr
59:14 - is not going all the way till the very
59:16 - end it's like 60 percent or something
59:19 - that's fine um so that that's something
59:22 - to look out for
59:24 - again um we just need to take care of
59:26 - all the details

60:09 - everybody can we can just go and and
60:12 - go okay say like yo guys remove that
60:17 - okay beautiful it's not cool all right
60:18 - so we got that portion what's going
60:20 - what's next
60:21 - david what's next is going to be the
60:24 - center portion of the application is
60:26 - going to be the main part
60:27 - uh it's going to be the emails view
60:31 - right now the js phone um
60:33 - [Music]
60:37 - so we are we just got another donation
60:40 - hello another donation
60:43 - oh my gosh someone delicious thank you
60:44 - so much thank you so much what's
60:46 - happening okay keep going keep going
60:47 - keep going keep going keep going okay
60:49 - keep going so what we'll do
60:51 - here is uh first let's actually set up
60:55 - all the
60:56 - styled component things yes uh because
60:59 - now we're working on guys is working on
61:00 - this portion right here so this could be
61:02 - this portion right here
61:03 - so this this this portion that can be
61:06 - our next
61:06 - our next goal okay make sense good cool
61:10 - cool cool
61:11 - so for that what we would say is we will
61:14 - have the wrapper
61:15 - obviously the usual good old wrapper
61:18 - and then that's actually can you
61:21 - actually
61:21 - bring up the finished version yes we can
61:24 - right here cool so what happens is
61:27 - actually
61:28 - we have rows all the way now we have a
61:31 - top row
61:32 - which is a little bit different from
61:33 - what we have below
61:35 - in terms of emails so the top row has a
61:37 - checkbox
61:38 - a refresh icon that was more icon or
61:41 - something
61:41 - and that's it and then the emails
61:44 - is actually is going to be a check box
61:47 - once again
61:48 - a star sender um
61:53 - what's that subject a little bit of
61:55 - intro from the email
61:57 - and then a timestamp or something right
61:59 - there and the time step right there
62:00 - beautiful i like it david beautiful
62:03 - cool cool so is this
62:11 - that's going to be the last part
62:16 - part three let's go i mean we will be
62:18 - using firebase today
62:19 - just so you know okay that's awesome i
62:20 - like that too much i like it i like it
62:22 - it's cool i'm happy i'm because i'm
62:24 - gonna say hey
62:25 - i'm excited so what what we will do is
62:28 - actually let's first go ahead and import
62:29 - checkbox refresh icon
62:31 - more vertical icon and
62:34 - icon button yes all from material ui
62:38 - icons no the two two in the middle
62:42 - is actually an icon but the icon button
62:44 - is actually just going to give the
62:46 - little ripple effect so if you click uh
62:49 - on the stars
62:50 - like that right there i like it i like
62:52 - it muy bueno i like it a lot yes yes yes
62:55 - so you can see the icon button is simply
62:57 - just a way for us to go ahead and click
62:58 - on this
62:59 - so and this is not coming from icons you
63:01 - can see it's coming from the core
63:02 - itself right from the core itself and
63:05 - that's what allows us to click on these
63:06 - and actually have like this ripple just
63:07 - like the check box
63:08 - yeah yeah awesome i like it okay yeah so
63:10 - let's use it now so
63:11 - to create those let's go ahead and i'm
63:13 - going to go to emails view here
63:15 - all right so let's do the top ra wrapper
63:17 - first
63:18 - so we're going to create this top
63:19 - wrapper initially right
63:21 - and then we're going to create this
63:22 - bottom wrapper after that so this is
63:25 - called the emails container right
63:27 - so that's what we're doing right now so
63:29 - let's go ahead and do this i'm going to
63:30 - say
63:30 - rectangle
63:33 - and then the side portion is going to be
63:35 - this portion and if i go to my arrows
63:39 - beautiful beautiful beautiful you can
63:42 - see dave right now is very nicely queen
63:44 - of style.div
63:45 - at the bottom right here awesome and
63:48 - then what's going to happen is we're
63:49 - going to create the
63:50 - the top rapper style.div equal style.div
63:54 - beautiful beautiful beautiful and now
63:56 - what's going to happen is we're going to
63:57 - what
63:58 - let's go ahead and create the bottom
64:00 - wrapper which is the emails container as
64:01 - well let's create the email container as
64:02 - well okay beautiful
64:05 - so should we do it now
64:08 - yeah let's do right now let's do right
64:09 - now i'll do right now right now i know i
64:11 - know i know yeah
64:13 - oh let's actually give it a little bit
64:16 - of spacing in the code because
64:18 - nice code is always good we will just
64:21 - say emails
64:22 - container nice nice nice nice nice
64:27 - yes oh so many emails containers there's
64:29 - like three of them that's awesome
64:30 - beautiful exactly what we want okay okay
64:34 - yes cool got that and we will just leave
64:37 - the emails container for now
64:39 - cause there's gonna be some magic stuff
64:41 - happening
64:42 - uh let's just define the
64:45 - uh style.div
64:48 - okay so you can see that david is now
64:50 - creating style that there for the emails
64:52 - container at the bottom right there
64:53 - which is awesome
64:54 - and then what's going to happen we got
64:56 - that portion now let's let's go ahead
64:57 - and create those icon buttons
64:59 - right so those icon buttons you can see
65:02 - the emails container was created
65:03 - the the topper was created and now
65:05 - that's all beautiful beautiful next up
65:08 - is going to be to create the actual
65:10 - refresh icon so he's got the checkbox
65:12 - icon right here
65:13 - right here let's go do the refresh icon
65:16 - right here right
65:17 - but he's wrapping it out he's wrapping
65:19 - it inside the icon button
65:21 - because that will give us the ripple
65:22 - effect correct yes indeed
65:25 - yes it needs let's go ahead and save
65:26 - this exactly like this
65:29 - let's see what we got save this oh
65:32 - look at that if i go and look at this
65:34 - now look at this ripple effect boom
65:36 - boom boom boom boom boom uh uh oh so
65:39 - smash it yes

66:01 - right but just you know show us your
66:02 - love show us what you got that's all i
66:04 - gotta say
66:05 - all right so we got the check box we got
66:07 - the icon button
66:08 - let's go ahead and now create go to the
66:10 - bottom let's go and now create what
66:12 - the the the border should we create the
66:15 - border or should we
66:15 - or shall we create what the emails
66:17 - container
66:20 - whoa what's up i got crowd that's fine
66:23 - that's fine that's fine so here's what
66:25 - what's going to happen is we will now go
66:27 - ahead and create an individual
66:29 - email we got this portion created
66:31 - exactly right
66:32 - let's not create individual email but
66:34 - let's also modify the top wrapper to be
66:36 - a little bit better right so currently
66:37 - we have
66:38 - these icons whereas these icons are kind
66:40 - of you know they're very close together
66:42 - what we can do is we can make them
66:43 - display grid and actually give them some
66:45 - kind of
66:46 - you know width and width and so forth so
66:48 - here's what we'll do i got this exactly
66:49 - here you got it yeah
66:52 - display grid i'll just chill display
66:54 - grid okay
66:56 - display grid boom okay and again
66:59 - we're going to do display grid with the
67:00 - columns okay so every single thing is
67:02 - going to have a column okay so say grid
67:04 - columns grid
67:06 - grid grid dash template
67:10 - that's what columns okay there's columns
67:13 - and then we'll define the the columns
67:16 - meaning the width of each column right
67:18 - so
67:18 - the the first one is going to be 30
67:20 - pixels but i actually kind of want it to
67:22 - be
67:22 - hmm let's see i'm just very curious um
67:25 - can i be honest with you david though i
67:28 - don't want to use grid here what's up
67:29 - can i fully answer you i don't want to
67:30 - use grid here
67:32 - why no good because your thing is so
67:34 - good then
67:35 - it pushes them together here's what i'll
67:37 - do instead can i can i do something else
67:38 - instead
67:40 - these are nicely spaced instead what i
67:41 - would do is i would actually i like this
67:43 - i will i would instead space them out a
67:44 - little bit
67:45 - and i would instead of doing that i
67:47 - would just give it a little padding to
67:48 - the left hand side of 20 pixels that's
67:50 - what i would do there's no need for them
67:51 - to be grid because
67:52 - they're already centered beautifully
67:53 - look here's will do here's what just
67:54 - trust me okay in this just trust me
67:56 - hey i i trust you bro so padding left
68:00 - penny left is going to be 20 pixels okay
68:03 - just because i want to push them
68:04 - back a little to the left beautiful
68:05 - right there that's all we need okay
68:08 - padding up is 20 pixels the gap here is
68:10 - great i don't see a big issue with this
68:12 - gap whatsoever that's an amazing gap
68:14 - that's all great okay awesome
68:15 - the only thing i'll need is probably him
68:17 - to see this top rapper let me go and
68:19 - take a look at what is the height of
68:20 - this top wrapper
68:21 - okay this top wrapper this top wrapper
68:24 - is great as well it's actually what is
68:25 - the height is gonna be 48 pixels
68:27 - beautiful 48 pixels that's all we need
68:29 - so that means
68:30 - our other things are going to be 40
68:31 - pixels as well so here let's give it
68:33 - this
68:34 - let's do this we'll do this height of 48
68:37 - pixels just like that 48 pixels
68:39 - boom all right so let's give give a
68:41 - normal height
68:42 - and now look at this it's all clean it's
68:44 - beautiful no no spacing look at it see
68:46 - it's so clean that it's all amazing
68:48 - the next thing we're going to do is
68:50 - let's go ahead and create the actual
68:52 - what
68:52 - the email right the email now how do we
68:55 - create the email david
68:58 - so for the email we will have a separate
69:01 - um wait what's happening
69:06 - our clothes aren't insane anyways uh so
69:08 - what will happen
69:10 - is for now for this stream we will be
69:13 - using
69:14 - a attempt a temporary folder
69:17 - to store all the email data just like we
69:19 - did
69:20 - uh but actually when we will have the
69:23 - full image
69:24 - email functionality we will be just
69:26 - pretty much
69:27 - uh nice use firebase to store
69:30 - examples exactly so what will happen is
69:33 - inside of the source folder
69:34 - i'm going to just add in a temporary
69:37 - folder
69:38 - which is i'm just going to call it temp
69:40 - create it
69:41 - yep and right there
69:44 - as you can see that's what we created
69:46 - right here cool
69:48 - and inside of that folder
69:51 - i want to create an email data.js cool
69:56 - beautiful right there nice okay let's go
69:59 - and do that and it's just going to be a
70:01 - dummy email
70:02 - the daytime just copy and paste all your
70:04 - emails into here david
70:06 - yeah okay that's good let's do that
70:07 - right now
70:09 - beautiful so here's the emails guys you
70:10 - can see here's what happened right
70:12 - the emails data and all it is it's
70:13 - simply just an object it's an array okay
70:15 - that's
70:16 - all it pretty much is and this array has
70:18 - a few emails one is
70:20 - like this it says start true from now
70:22 - subject yo
70:23 - message sub bro right receive the a20
70:27 - and read so far and again these are only
70:29 - placeholders for now i know
70:31 - and when we go connect them to firebase
70:33 - then we'll go ahead and actually fully
70:35 - showcase how firebase works fully
70:37 - and showcase how we can connect firebase
70:39 - and actually show proper emails and even
70:41 - send emails
70:42 - in the part three we're going to send
70:43 - emails like we're going to use send grid
70:45 - to send emails which can be really
70:47 - really exciting i'm pumped for that bro
70:49 - i'm really pumped for that
70:51 - hell yeah yeah so now now this will
70:54 - allow us to actually use the emails
70:56 - back in the emails view okay so let's do
70:58 - that right now
71:00 - all right so what we will do is we will
71:02 - pretty much need to go ahead and import
71:04 - the email data so what we will say is
71:06 - import
71:07 - on the top and we will say email data
71:11 - and because it's not default exported we
71:13 - will need to use the squiggly braces
71:15 - beautiful
71:15 - and what we will say is we will need to
71:18 - go up a folder to the components
71:21 - and go out of components as well i
71:24 - believe
71:25 - because you can see in the temp folder
71:28 - you need to go outside the stamp folder
71:30 - to go back
71:31 - into them what no i think the ten
71:33 - folders inside what
71:35 - yeah then we need to go out of no we
71:37 - just need to go out once
71:38 - i think we need to go out of oh yeah
71:41 - because we're currently we're in the
71:42 - emails view so we're currently inside
71:43 - the components
71:44 - and we're currently here in the emails
71:45 - we need to go outside the layout
71:48 - right right here go outside the
71:50 - components
71:51 - right here go into temp right here and
71:54 - then go to empty meals data and that's
71:55 - how we get that beautiful right there
71:57 - beautiful awesome all right let's
71:58 - continue on awesome
72:00 - okay so and then we're just gonna loop
72:02 - through them uh
72:03 - once again this is just a for this
72:06 - stream
72:07 - setup but we will be actually using the
72:11 - almost same structure
72:19 - yep so what we'll do is we will go ahead
72:21 - and we'll loop through the emails data
72:23 - like so
72:24 - right so we'll take email data from here
72:26 - right here
72:27 - i'll map through them right there so
72:29 - just go ahead and type and i'll just
72:30 - narrate okay for you
72:31 - okay all right so go ahead and map
72:34 - through them
72:34 - beautiful and then what's going to
72:36 - happen is as we're mapping through them
72:38 - really quickly guys
72:39 - is what's what's going on here which is
72:41 - really interesting guys what's going on
72:43 - here is really cool
72:44 - is we are actually grabbing the data
72:47 - individual data from
72:48 - every single kind of object right this
72:50 - is called
72:51 - destructuring right it's called to
72:53 - destructure an object
72:54 - when you map through something right you
72:56 - get the whole object which looks a
72:58 - little bit kind of like
72:59 - this right this is the whole object you
73:00 - get right it's the whole object right
73:02 - here
73:02 - what you can do is you can actually
73:04 - structure it but you was doing using
73:06 - a square like these squiggly brackets
73:08 - right here and doing start from
73:10 - and grabbing the individual keys we call
73:13 - it
73:14 - from every single item it's as simple as
73:17 - that
73:17 - understood boom boom boom boom awesome
73:20 - let's go and continue on
73:22 - all right so now we actually need to go
73:25 - ahead and create a new folder
73:27 - with the with the email item because
73:30 - that's going to be an external component
73:32 - so if we go ahead and create a folder
73:35 - which we will call
73:36 - email item boom right there uh
73:39 - it should be there and an email
73:43 - item.js file good so we'll go ahead and
73:46 - do that so we'll have an email item
73:47 - right here
73:48 - so he created a folder called email item
73:49 - guys and then from that he created an
73:51 - email item.js file it's as simple as
73:54 - that beautiful
73:55 - awesome and this is where our email item
73:57 - actually exists this whole email item
73:59 - component
74:00 - will exist there nice
74:03 - yeah and i'm just going to type in rafc
74:05 - because i'm a lazy guy and
74:08 - i'm using snippets so
74:11 - right now component ready
74:16 - and let's actually go ahead and import
74:17 - styled components here as well so it was
74:20 - import style
74:20 - from nice styled components
74:24 - beautiful beautiful beautiful cool
74:29 - and now what's gonna happen is we will
74:32 - just go ahead and make
74:34 - and one email item okay so let's go
74:37 - ahead and
74:38 - we'll make one email item is that right
74:40 - yes yes yes but
74:42 - first let's actually go back to email
74:44 - emails view so we will be testing with
74:46 - the live data
74:47 - let's do it what we already made cool
74:49 - yes all right so
74:51 - what's gonna happen is let's actually go
74:54 - ahead and import
74:56 - the email item file on the top
74:59 - so that should be this one right there
75:03 - right there beautiful good good and what
75:06 - we will say
75:07 - is we will have the email item
75:11 - uh over here to be used nice so we'll
75:14 - use the email item now
75:16 - yes good and and we'll pass in the data
75:20 - into it correct exactly so let's pass
75:22 - another data we'll pass in a star so it
75:24 - can do so you go ahead and type
75:26 - so the pass and is starred then we'll
75:29 - pass and from
75:30 - right there then we'll pass in subject
75:32 - into this component
75:33 - okay after from so passing subject
75:35 - meaningful it's going to continue on
75:37 - then we'll pass it after subject we'll
75:39 - pass in the message
75:40 - there we go received and read just like
75:43 - this received
75:44 - and again these are all parameters that
75:46 - are going to go into the component
75:47 - itself guys okay they're going to go
75:49 - into the component itself that's a
75:50 - really cool part about this
75:51 - awesome so we got the specific
75:52 - proportion that's amazing now
75:54 - let's go back to email item let's see
75:56 - what we got so if i refresh this
75:58 - really see nothing's happening because
76:00 - if we go to email item
76:01 - it's pretty much empty however if i say
76:03 - for example email
76:05 - save this you see now we have three
76:07 - emails because we're wrapping over
76:09 - that's what's up bro what's up that's
76:12 - what's up i know right it's sick right
76:14 - so now we have three emails that we are
76:16 - going to like loop through
76:18 - non-stop okay beautiful now let's
76:20 - actually all we need to do now is just
76:21 - simply modify the email component itself
76:23 - focus on this specific component and
76:25 - just do it the first thing we're gonna
76:27 - do
76:27 - is what first thing we would just need
76:29 - to go ahead and catch
76:30 - all the stuff that we will be we are
76:32 - actually passing in here
76:34 - so we will need to make sure that we
76:36 - actually catch those correct
76:37 - so what these are called these are
76:39 - called props guys these are called props
76:41 - okay but with props the cool thing about
76:43 - props is you can again
76:44 - destructure them right so when we pass
76:47 - at this data right here
76:49 - okay they pass into the parameters of
76:51 - the component it's as simple as that
76:53 - right in the email item when we have to
76:55 - catch that we have to be able to like
76:57 - when you throw something you have to
76:58 - catch it correct yes or no david like if
77:00 - i throw a ball at you
77:01 - you don't catch it hits your face you
77:02 - know what i mean it's not good
77:04 - you know what i mean that's not good at
77:05 - all so what i want to do instead is i
77:08 - want to catch it by using props
77:10 - now once i cut it i can actually
77:12 - structure it and that's why
77:14 - we can do something like this so we can
77:15 - do the whole the whole the structuring
77:18 - with this specific portion which looks a
77:20 - little bit kind of like
77:21 - boom right there start from subject
77:23 - message received
77:24 - red that will destructure the whole
77:27 - thing
77:27 - amazing good awesome all right let's go
77:30 - and keep going bro
77:31 - perfect though all right so we will be
77:34 - using
77:35 - uh the check box once again from
77:37 - material ui
77:39 - and we will have this all these uh
77:41 - little things
77:43 - so yeah so we will be using the checkbox
77:47 - that's good
77:47 - and actually there is a little bit of
77:50 - tweak
77:50 - to it because if you click the star
77:54 - it actually changes oh let's go
77:57 - that's amazing oh that's awesome that's
78:00 - sick
78:01 - and and you might be thinking that okay
78:03 - i might just
78:04 - go ahead and change the color but
78:06 - instead i'm actually changing the exact
78:08 - the actual icon really yeah really
78:12 - why wait really no way so what i
78:16 - yeah interesting interesting what i do
78:18 - is i have this star
78:19 - border icon
78:23 - the difference between the two is the
78:25 - star border icon is that empty thing
78:27 - and the star icon is the full field okay
78:30 - uh
78:30 - the actual freaking icon like can i show
78:33 - you how you can actually
78:34 - change it up a little bit or no can i
78:37 - show you how you can change it up a
78:38 - little bit check this out here's what
78:40 - i'll do instead of this
78:41 - because you can actually make it simpler
78:42 - the way you have it right now so here's
78:44 - what we'll do
78:45 - is let's now first let's go ahead and
78:46 - create the checkbox let's do the
78:48 - checkbox one so let's do a checkbox
78:49 - that's part one okay so we'll do just
78:51 - checkbox here
78:52 - so we'll do a checkbox
78:56 - awesome so we got the checkbox let's uh
79:00 - say the checkbox do we say do you have
79:02 - the checkbox
79:03 - i don't see no checkbox oh i do see the
79:05 - checkbox beautiful oh there
79:06 - there they are so we need okay now the
79:09 - star
79:10 - okay the star is this star i'm a star
79:13 - i'm a star okay so as a star
79:17 - i'll do i'll quit the icon button and
79:19 - then i'll do like this
79:20 - icon button i'm a star okay so i can
79:23 - button right there
79:24 - yes i am all right such a stop i know
79:28 - i'm a stop i know
79:29 - so icon button right there guys and then
79:31 - what's going to happen this can be
79:32 - become the icon button for this star
79:35 - okay now the star is going to be
79:38 - have the star icon now the style icon
79:41 - now changes the penny
79:43 - on a few things now of course if
79:46 - the star is true we're going to because
79:48 - you can see here the emails data
79:50 - the start can be true or false start
79:52 - true or false
79:54 - right so here's what we'll do we'll do
79:56 - here
79:57 - go to emails item and we'll do this
79:59 - start
80:00 - if here's will do we'll say like this if
80:04 - starred
80:06 - starred right if start equals true
80:10 - question mark question mark then we'll
80:13 - go ahead is
80:14 - do this boom right there
80:20 - right so that's going to then we're
80:22 - going to do is we'll create
80:24 - a this star icon looks a little bit like
80:26 - this star icon so check this out there's
80:28 - a star icon
80:29 - and this star icon will have the color
80:31 - of where this icon will have some kind
80:33 - of different colors okay seven
80:34 - cb 69. now if the star is false
80:38 - again this this by the way guys for
80:39 - those of you who don't know this is
80:40 - these are shorthand
80:42 - for if and else so for example if start
80:44 - is true
80:45 - if that's true we do this however if
80:48 - it's
80:48 - false meaning else then we do the
80:50 - following or right there
80:54 - then we do the follow we do star icon
80:57 - star border icon button
80:58 - which is going to be this one
80:59 - specifically right there boom right
81:01 - there so now i'm going to go ahead and
81:02 - save this
81:03 - awesome boom boom let's go and take a
81:05 - look at this hey
81:06 - you can see now these are icons you can
81:08 - see okay and they're all great
81:10 - they look beautiful and amazing and
81:12 - they're just shining like a bright star
81:15 - right now now one cool thing is of
81:18 - course
81:18 - we should be able to click on them right
81:20 - and actually something should happen
81:21 - something like the actual start
81:23 - should should change right now to do
81:25 - that we'll create a div on this icon
81:27 - button we'll do for example the
81:28 - following we'll do
81:30 - on click of this icon button we'll do
81:32 - unclick
81:33 - on click we'll do something we'll do huh
81:37 - does it work like that of course
81:40 - bro okay you know me bro come on bro
81:44 - come on bro come on bro you know how
81:47 - this is done bro
81:49 - so here's we'll do guys for every single
81:51 - component
81:52 - actually what we'll do is we'll we'll
81:54 - use we'll save state
81:56 - i'm going to save state for every single
81:58 - component and if it's
81:59 - start is true or start as false so
82:02 - here's will do
82:03 - um we're going to use use date so it's
82:04 - going to import you state oh god i love
82:06 - this
82:06 - oh god i love coding guys i don't get to
82:09 - code so often because now i have to
82:10 - teach a lot so
82:11 - i love teaching but i just love coding
82:13 - sometimes too so
82:14 - you state you state okay so we'll import
82:18 - state right here
82:19 - beautiful that's awesome and then once
82:21 - we've done that all we got to do is
82:22 - let's go ahead and create a a state com
82:25 - estate value of star so for example
82:27 - let's just say
82:28 - here uh we'll stay const i will say star
82:32 - star right there start right there and
82:34 - then stop
82:36 - and it's gonna say set star beautiful
82:39 - and then what i'll do is in the u state
82:42 - u state and here's we'll do it i will
82:45 - actually initialize it
82:46 - to the start value that was passed in
82:48 - like this
82:49 - start beautiful right
82:52 - so now for example exactly so now
82:55 - instead of checking for start we're
82:56 - going to check for the star
82:57 - which is here because again guys the
83:00 - start is actually now a state component
83:02 - correct a state value right
83:04 - so here's i'll do it now i'll do star
83:06 - star right here
83:07 - which is beautiful star and look it's
83:10 - still working no problem right
83:11 - no problem now check this out on the
83:14 - click of this
83:15 - button icon here's what i'll do i'll do
83:18 - equals
83:21 - right there so i'll do check this out
83:23 - you ready for this bro
83:24 - i'll do this i'm so ready and i'll do
83:27 - set star
83:28 - on the click of this i'll do set star
83:32 - all depends i have to do set stuff
83:34 - depending if it's true or false
83:35 - so this this is where i actually have to
83:37 - create a function let's go ahead and do
83:39 - uh const we'll do
83:43 - cons change star and we'll create a
83:46 - function called equal this
83:48 - so here this
83:51 - so depending on what the star is
83:54 - we're going to change the star right so
83:59 - right you want to do it like that no
84:02 - can we do it like that no no no you
84:04 - can't do that no no no we can't right no
84:06 - no no no no no
84:07 - i mean i mean actually i mean
84:09 - technically here's i mean let's
84:10 - let's check it can we actually try here
84:12 - here's we'll do it here's one no no no
84:13 - no no no no no no no no try try
84:28 - then let's talk set star to what to
84:31 - false
84:32 - right otherwise we'll do such star
84:36 - no not star
84:39 - star we'll do set star star
84:44 - to true otherwise basically here if
84:47 - you're thinking on the click of this
84:48 - okay it's pretty simple
84:50 - if the stars true will set it to fall so
84:52 - basically to make it the reverse correct
84:54 - very simple
84:55 - however if it is false we'll set it back
84:57 - to true the reverse of it as again
84:59 - so how can you function bro how clean is
85:01 - this look bro
85:04 - this is so clean i know so this is like
85:06 - wait wait wait oh it's not work
85:08 - actually fully hold on
85:09 - oh damn it did not work come on i know i
85:11 - know i know
85:13 - i mean that could be a few different
85:14 - issues right that could be a few
85:15 - different shows
85:17 - i know i know so let me see maybe maybe
85:18 - you need to refresh this maybe to
85:19 - refresh it so let me see
85:22 - no no no let me see let's try this again
85:23 - let me see if setstar is it
85:26 - is the icon button actually a div like
85:30 - yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i can do this
85:31 - no problem i'll give you an approach
85:33 - okay okay okay so in the valid handler
85:36 - probably unclick did you mean
85:37 - on click oh because i think i did wait
85:40 - hold on
85:41 - i just capitalized it so you might need
85:43 - to refresh and
85:44 - shout out to save save email item
85:46 - because i just uh capitalized
85:48 - on click okay wait wait wait wait wait
85:50 - wait one click so you want to save the
85:52 - file
85:52 - cool and then refresh oh let's go
85:59 - that's what i'm talking about oh yeah
86:05 - yeah yeah
86:20 - bruh
86:34 - all right so we got that porsche that is
86:35 - amazing look you see how cool that
86:37 - is bro how cool is that very cool so
86:40 - cool all right
86:40 - i have 10 minutes exactly before we
86:42 - finish this bro and we haven't finished
86:43 - it
86:43 - we have 10 minutes to finish this bro
86:45 - what's up we have 10 minutes to finish
86:47 - and we gotta go
86:48 - yup we do yep so here let's go check
86:50 - this out
86:51 - the next thing look that's all working
86:53 - no problem it's so clean now too look
86:55 - how clean this is bro oh so clean i love
86:56 - this
86:57 - it's the cleanest thing ever cool so
87:00 - let's go ahead and do this
87:01 - um for every single wrapper one thing i
87:03 - want to do for the wrapper is
87:04 - just how did the padding 20 pixels let's
87:06 - do padding left 20 pixels on here
87:10 - padding left
87:13 - padding left 20 pixels save that
87:17 - oh oh you see how good that looks let's
87:20 - add a
87:20 - let's add a border as well at the top
87:22 - should we add a border at the top let's
87:23 - do border top
87:24 - that's going to be so nice and clean
87:27 - yeah uh i would actually use
87:28 - gap instead of border top and stuff like
87:30 - that because with uh
87:32 - people i mean look look look look look
87:35 - look it looks good what are you talking
87:36 - about
87:37 - look at this it looks great i don't know
87:38 - what you're talking about it's not fancy
87:40 - it looks great bro i don't know what you
87:41 - want man it looks great
87:46 - you know what i mean all right so okay
87:48 - at that point what's going to happen
87:49 - guys i
87:50 - while while there is a little bit stuck
87:52 - here that's fine what we'll do is we'll
87:54 - go ahead and create a few things which
87:55 - is the first thing we're going to create
87:57 - is going to be uh which one it's going
87:59 - to be this nas and qazi
88:01 - so this is going to be the name portion
88:02 - right here so is it that's the name
88:04 - portion correct so from right is that
88:06 - from or two
88:07 - it's from right so let's just do a b a p
88:10 - class with from that's the from yeah so
88:12 - let's do that right now so here's what
88:14 - we'll do
88:14 - boom p class name and what's going to
88:16 - happen is basically
88:18 - here's what's happening if basically if
88:20 - a red if it's red
88:23 - then we'll make the class name unread
88:26 - right basically i mean actually it's a
88:29 - little bit weird hold on if
88:30 - red is equal to no no what you want here
88:33 - is
88:33 - if it if it's not red so if it's an
88:36 - unread email
88:37 - yeah so that that's why i'm saying like
88:39 - if you feel like this the red
88:40 - if not red right there if not red right
88:43 - there
88:44 - then we say okay unread is the class
88:46 - name
88:47 - i know i know i know otherwise there is
88:49 - no class name exactly otherwise there's
88:51 - no class name
88:51 - so this is why now again the unread
88:53 - simply has this specific
88:55 - black like it's dark and you can see
88:57 - that right there that's unread beautiful
88:59 - so that's unread and then let's go ahead
89:01 - and click create the one for
89:02 - the what what the which what is the
89:04 - other one oh for the title
89:06 - right we will have the subject and the
89:10 - message
89:10 - yeah yeah the subject so let's call it
89:11 - the subject
89:15 - so once again we will be doing the exact
89:17 - same red
89:18 - or not red thing yeah
89:22 - that's not
89:34 - so we got that so what's going to happen
89:36 - now is again if it's not red
89:38 - then what we'll do is we'll we'll create
89:40 - the subject beautiful
89:41 - nice yes yes and then we will be using a
89:46 - span in there i think
89:47 - you have too many p tags here i think
89:49 - this one's one should not be here so
89:51 - i got you bro oh yeah correct i got it i
89:53 - got you bro
89:54 - i got you you got me i got your house
89:57 - got you
89:58 - thank you look at that it looks sick i
90:00 - mean it looks horrible but it looks sick
90:01 - at the same time
90:03 - right i mean it gets the job done does
90:06 - it get the job done guys all right the
90:07 - most important thing guys you see
90:09 - you see the sender you see the subject
90:11 - you see everything like
90:12 - what else do you think it's awesome i
90:13 - agree it's amazing i agree bro i agree
90:15 - cool so
90:19 - and last but not least we will need to
90:21 - have a timestamp because
90:22 - otherwise like emails like
90:26 - we just need to have the timestamp right
90:31 - and once again uh we are going to be
90:33 - handling
90:34 - if it is unread or not and
90:38 - then we will be passing in the received
90:40 - prop
90:42 - which i used to received at time
90:45 - and just received in short okay so
90:47 - that's going to be the timestamp
90:49 - um cool so now what we will do is we
90:52 - already have the padding
90:54 - on the left hand side we have the border
90:56 - top which is going to be one
90:58 - pixel solid light gray that is amazing
91:01 - okay so now what we will be doing is we
91:03 - will be doing display grid
91:05 - and this is why i this is why it's so
91:07 - like i
91:08 - literally i love this great grid uh
91:10 - because i can say grid
91:12 - template uh template
91:16 - the columns yeah like um
91:20 - i can't write today what's happening
91:22 - today i know and
91:25 - and instead of messing around with all
91:27 - the columns and all that
91:28 - things i can just say uh the first one
91:31 - is going to be 30 pixels
91:34 - 50 pixels then it's gonna be 120 pixels
91:37 - then
91:38 - it's going to be auto and then it's
91:40 - going to be 50 pixels so we are
91:42 - pretty much what we what we are saying
91:44 - is we are reserving 50 pixels at the
91:46 - very end
91:49 - beautiful see what i mean and then we'll
91:52 - do is we'll align the center to make
91:53 - sure they're vertically aligned
91:54 - so let's do that right now uh
91:58 - we will do in it just a second so
92:01 - before we actually do that uh because we
92:03 - can do it in the
92:04 - display grid we can say we want to give
92:08 - a
92:08 - gap of 10 pixels so we will uh support
92:12 - all the items all the children items
92:16 - inside of the wrapper
92:18 - are going to have a gap in between them
92:19 - of 10 pixels does it make sense i like
92:21 - it i like it i like it i like it
92:22 - beautiful i like it
92:24 - you like it cool
92:28 - and you see like it's actually off
92:31 - a little bit vertically so what i will
92:33 - say is we will go ahead and
92:35 - uh say align items center okay beautiful
92:38 - it's gonna save that
92:39 - so that's oh that's so awesome beautiful
92:42 - nice
92:44 - so i think we are good on the rapper
92:47 - side now
92:48 - we will have the div inside here correct
92:50 - one thing i want to say though
92:52 - one thing i want to say is this one
92:54 - right here on the
92:55 - on the left you see how it's not aligned
92:56 - with this one is because of the width
92:59 - the width here so here's what i'll do on
93:01 - this except this one instead of doing 30
93:02 - pixels i'll do actually main content
93:04 - check this out okay when content boom
93:08 - right there see
93:08 - main content i also do main content for
93:11 - the star so the star aligns directly
93:13 - with this
93:13 - refresh button icon so also do main
93:16 - content for this one
93:17 - and content all right boom right there
93:21 - see many content no then we can just say
93:23 - ming khan and mean content
93:26 - right this game this gap you don't
93:27 - really need at this point at this point
93:29 - either as well
93:30 - oops what happened here did you make no
93:33 - no no no
93:34 - hey no no it's so good so good so good
93:36 - beautiful look at that oh look at this
93:38 - now
93:38 - that's so amazing that's amazing
93:41 - dope bro that was cool and now the only
93:43 - thing we need to fix is this portion
93:45 - right here because where this portion
93:46 - right here is like
93:47 - you know top to bottom that should be
93:49 - pretty simple we just have to use
93:50 - display flex to fix that
93:51 - so refresh that correct save that your
93:54 - favorite part
93:56 - hey let's go
93:59 - yes yeah yeah hmm
94:08 - and i actually forgot to add the cursor
94:10 - pointer
94:11 - so if i actually hover over i want to
94:14 - like have that little hand thingy
94:19 - instead of the arrow or i don't know
94:22 - yeah cool and uh next up we have
94:25 - uh inside of the div
94:28 - uh we want to target those pens so
94:32 - span and the span we're targeting is
94:34 - again this one right here guys this
94:36 - right here correct these spans of like
94:38 - the message span
94:39 - right here so i would do like they're
94:42 - beautiful so we'll
94:43 - let's refresh this oh let's save that
94:47 - awesome stuff so you can see this pan is
94:49 - this one right now see it just create
94:50 - just a little bit of color the grayish
94:51 - color that that's all pretty much it
94:52 - does
94:53 - and let's now go ahead at that point
94:54 - let's go ahead and do the unread section
94:56 - of it too the unread
94:57 - exactly and so in case and you actually
95:01 - want to make sure that the unread is at
95:03 - the very end because it's going to
95:04 - overwrite everything all
95:06 - above exactly beautiful you need to make
95:09 - sure that that is
95:11 - end so color is going to be black
95:14 - and font weight
95:17 - good is going to be bolder beautiful
95:20 - beautiful beauty
95:23 - so that being said though we're pretty
95:26 - much
95:27 - cool yeah yeah yep yep yep
95:30 - exactly exactly so that's bolder now so
95:32 - it's going to save this that's amazing
95:34 - beautiful
95:34 - and you can see now when it fits on red
95:36 - you see now it's a different color now
95:37 - one that will add though is add a little
95:39 - bit of padding for this padding right
95:40 - right here this uh
95:41 - 820 i'll do a penny right on that one
95:44 - just to
95:44 - give it a same padding so the padding
95:46 - that's right
95:48 - of 20 pixels right there to save that
95:51 - okay that makes
95:51 - oh look at how good this looks just like
95:54 - holy moly that's all good guys oh my god
95:57 - i know oh my god oh my god
96:01 - look at this now you can click the star
96:02 - you can start if you want oh my gosh
96:04 - that's so good
96:05 - and we have the cursor pointer as well
96:07 - that looks amazing guys
