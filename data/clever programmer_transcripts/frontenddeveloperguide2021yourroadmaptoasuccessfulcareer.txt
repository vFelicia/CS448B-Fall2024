01:46 - you guys
01:48 - so i'm gonna show here sushant thank you
01:51 - so much
01:51 - so here's where the fun begins and if
01:53 - you're thinking where do i
01:55 - begin right it doesn't matter just start
01:58 - i think that's the really important
01:59 - thing
02:00 - now let's just get straight into it so
02:01 - what's happening here sonny
02:03 - right so guys like we always get this
02:04 - question of like are we talking about
02:06 - front end are we talking about back end
02:07 - today everything we cover guys is going
02:10 - to be
02:10 - front end and what do we mean by front
02:12 - end right we mean what you're going to
02:13 - see on the websites
02:14 - all of the builds that we're doing are
02:16 - front-end builds at the moment um and
02:18 - then if we
02:19 - click on the uh click on the next i
02:21 - think the javascript should pop up right
02:22 - now
02:23 - yeah um and basically guys whenever we
02:26 - talk about javascript we're talking
02:28 - about the front end whenever you hear
02:29 - about node.js we're talking about
02:31 - back-end right so back-end is some
02:32 - server somewhere else
02:33 - but it's not the website that you're
02:35 - seeing when you're interacting with like
02:37 - amazon when you're interacting with
02:38 - twitter and those sort of things
02:40 - the back end is separate we're going to
02:41 - be talking about that in a different
02:43 - video
02:43 - today everything we talk about is front
02:45 - end right so just know that before we
02:47 - jump into this video
02:48 - love it karthik says your content is
02:51 - more worth
02:52 - than any other paid courses out there
02:55 - really appreciate that
02:56 - okay so here is what's going on so we
03:00 - got html css and javascript and what is
03:03 - what is what are we looking at why is
03:04 - this important
03:05 - right so these are the fundamentals guys
03:07 - that we're going to be covering so
03:09 - the three main things that you need to
03:11 - know about when it comes to front and
03:12 - web development
03:13 - are html css and javascript they are the
03:15 - three
03:16 - power points in this uh in this
03:18 - presentation they are literally
03:19 - everything that you need to be
03:21 - like concentrated on on getting better
03:23 - at when it comes to front end
03:24 - development
03:24 - 100 and now let's talk about job
03:27 - opportunities and salary for front-end
03:29 - developers guys so here are the salaries
03:31 - for javascript developers by experience
03:33 - and like take a look at this right
03:35 - less than one year of experience it's
03:37 - possible for people to make 62 000
03:39 - a year and in 2020 75 000
03:43 - a year and then going down you know one
03:45 - to four years you can see the salaries
03:47 - keep increasing but i know most of the
03:49 - people that are watching this channel
03:50 - have
03:50 - less than one year of experience so if
03:53 - you just put your head down
03:55 - not complain don't look up don't change
03:58 - your focus every two minutes
04:00 - and just put in the work i'm talking
04:02 - eight to ten hours or more
04:04 - per day if you can do that it's very
04:06 - possible for you to be hitting these
04:08 - numbers actually even
04:09 - way before the one year mark
04:13 - definitely and guys some of you might be
04:15 - wondering it's in dollars and i'm not in
04:16 - america
04:17 - it does not matter guys with the
04:18 - internet you can pretty much work for
04:20 - anyone your client could be in america
04:22 - and you could get paid in dollars so
04:23 - this applies to everyone
04:24 - yep it applies to everyone so the job
04:27 - opportunity
04:28 - is really crazy there are 45 000 jobs
04:29 - available as of right this second on
04:31 - justindeed.com for javascript
04:33 - on upwork if you look there are 8 000
04:35 - jobs available and you guys can go there
04:37 - right now and they're probably even more
04:39 - because of kovitz so guys job
04:40 - opportunities only going
04:42 - up while a lot of people are losing
04:44 - their jobs that are doing a lot of
04:45 - physical stuff programmers are not
04:48 - exactly here you have what's going on
04:51 - here and we just got a 400 repeat
04:53 - donation
04:54 - from simba so thank you so much for that
04:56 - he says learn a lot today finish your
04:58 - instagram clone today
04:59 - uh quality content for free and i think
05:02 - this is about five dollars or six
05:04 - dollars usd so thank you so much
05:07 - nice now what are we looking at here
05:09 - sonny
05:10 - so we're looking at sort of the
05:12 - different um programming languages in
05:14 - terms of popularity guys
05:15 - so in terms of professional developers
05:17 - you can see at the top at the top two
05:19 - right now javascript html css
05:22 - those were those three that we just
05:23 - mentioned before in regards to front end
05:25 - development and you can see
05:26 - they've overtaken java they've overtaken
05:28 - python they've overtaken sql so if
05:29 - you're ever in that question
05:31 - of wondering what do what should i learn
05:33 - should i learn java should i learn this
05:34 - and that
05:35 - guys put your energy towards javascript
05:37 - html css and like we said there's plenty
05:39 - of money
05:40 - that's what you need to know moving
05:41 - can't go wrong with that
05:43 - now when we were talking earlier about
05:45 - different countries right
05:46 - it doesn't matter if you're in india
05:48 - you're in turkey you're in
05:50 - i don't know god knows where you're
05:51 - sitting in dubai and you're like what's

06:07 - thousand a year canada they're making
06:09 - about four thousand united kingdom

08:05 - as we possibly can yep with that said
08:07 - let's just go
08:08 - right back so now this is the overall
08:11 - lay of the land so to speak when you
08:13 - think about a front-end developer
08:15 - there's a lot going on
08:16 - and now as we get more advanced you know
08:18 - back in the day maybe it was just you
08:19 - needed an html css
08:21 - and maybe javascript and your friend and
08:22 - developer now guys it's definitely a lot
08:25 - more involved
08:26 - because a lot of jobs expect you to know
08:28 - a lot of things so
08:30 - you got to learn the tools like npm
08:32 - webpack chrome dev tools this is some
08:34 - of the stuff that we're going to be
08:35 - covering in this presentation today
08:38 - you got to know html you gotta know css
08:41 - and pre
08:41 - pro processors like post css less and
08:44 - sas
08:45 - or scss you guys will need to know
08:47 - frameworks like angular
08:49 - or view or react which one kind of do
08:51 - you want to pick
08:52 - right you will need to know things like
08:54 - javascript or typescript
08:57 - and you will need to know about
08:58 - component libraries what's your flavor
09:00 - of choice is it bootstrap we talked
09:02 - about bootstrap 5 actually
09:04 - yesterday is a semantic ui or material
09:07 - ui you know
09:08 - where are you at exactly and i see a lot
09:11 - of questions about typescript guys we
09:12 - will be covering all of the things that
09:14 - you guys see here in this video
09:16 - so stay tuned and uh be sure that we are
09:18 - going to cover those
09:19 - yeah prince says in this lockdown i've
09:20 - learned a lot of things from you guys
09:22 - thanks to both of you for all of this
09:23 - free
09:24 - valuable content thank you so much thank
09:27 - you dude
09:28 - pretty cool now what can you do with
09:30 - javascript
09:31 - sunny oh nice we just got a three pound
09:34 - donation by is
09:37 - thank you dude appreciate thank you
09:39 - seriously appreciate that guys that's
09:41 - huge
09:42 - massive right so guys what can we do
09:44 - with javascript right we can do a bunch
09:46 - of things we can build web apps which
09:48 - you guys have seen in our amazing live
09:49 - builds
09:50 - hope you guys are enjoying those by the
09:51 - way you can build some native apps so
09:53 - not by learning something like react you
09:55 - can actually go ahead and build
09:56 - ios android apps which is amazingly
09:58 - powerful and you can actually go ahead
10:00 - and then take it further
10:02 - and have server apps using node.js so
10:04 - that is a back-end technology that we're
10:06 - talking about
10:06 - um but yeah pretty much with one
10:08 - language javascript you can go ahead and
10:10 - do all of this stuff so
10:11 - amazing now let's get into the
10:15 - technical nitty-gritty guys nice
10:19 - we just threw that in there because we
10:20 - love sonny's british accent so when he
10:21 - says
10:23 - we love that we all love that drop a
10:25 - like for that accent
10:27 - now what's going on so here guys when it
10:29 - comes to this you got to learn the
10:31 - basics okay with html
10:33 - make a page make it work don't over
10:35 - complicate it
10:36 - so that's just the basic foundation
10:38 - right
10:39 - yeah keep it simple just get html up and
10:42 - running on your page and literally that
10:43 - just means like get some stuff
10:44 - on a page and that's it move and then
10:47 - move to start moving forward like
10:48 - don't over complicate it don't start
10:50 - thinking all these other things just get
10:51 - moving with it and then move over
10:53 - to css so css is cascading
10:56 - stylesheet and that's on the next slide
10:59 - and here guys you want to learn how to
11:01 - use different layouts so how do you
11:02 - position things on the page in different
11:04 - ways
11:04 - and for that you can learn flexbox and
11:07 - flexbox is going to help you achieve a
11:08 - really nice responsive design
11:10 - and then you compare that with media
11:11 - queries to get things working
11:13 - just as you want it on like mobile
11:15 - tablet and everything like that so
11:17 - something to look into uh it's
11:18 - definitely a massive fundamental here
11:20 - css
11:21 - yup 100 learn that now with javascript
11:25 - you guys got to make sure you master the
11:26 - fundamentals
11:28 - learn the basics learn them inside out
11:30 - learn problem solving learn things like
11:32 - data types learn things like
11:34 - functions and es6 versus es7
11:37 - so for example what is that arrow
11:39 - looking thing right
11:41 - that's more es6 es7 as in before there
11:44 - would just be regular functions so
11:45 - learn those things because those are
11:47 - very common at every job you'll need to
11:48 - know them
11:49 - learn about dom manipulation learn about
11:51 - scopes and fetch api
11:53 - and learn a lot about asynchronous
11:55 - programming lolo
11:57 - thank you so much for another donation
12:00 - and he says what's the statistics on
12:01 - degree and no degree jobs
12:03 - i think at this point guys if you have
12:06 - the skills down it doesn't matter
12:08 - whether you have the degree or no degree
12:09 - there are tons of developers working at
12:12 - facebook at microsoft at google at
12:16 - netflix who don't have degrees
12:18 - and are making upwards of 200 or even
12:20 - 300 000
12:21 - a year yeah even elon musk just said
12:24 - that he pretty much ruled out the need
12:25 - for a degree now so
12:27 - yeah official companies are rolling out
12:28 - yeah yeah so that's huge
12:30 - so now what about the visual design
12:33 - stuff guys that's so important
12:35 - so let's jump straight into that
12:37 - actually so let's talk about
12:39 - some of the visual design stuff that we
12:41 - think is actually super important we'll
12:43 - start from the start
12:45 - yeah so there are five key principles of
12:47 - good design and suddenly you want to
12:48 - talk about some of them
12:50 - yeah so guys the first one is visual
12:52 - hierarchy so this is all about oh and
12:54 - one
12:54 - one thing actually just before we go
12:56 - into it uh
12:57 - guys this slide these slides were made
13:00 - by somebody on the team alex who's
13:02 - actually
13:02 - the newest addition to our team at
13:04 - clever programmer and he
13:06 - is phenomenal extremely talented
13:10 - uh kid he's only 19 years old and he had
13:13 - amazing resources on the front end side
13:16 - and so we're like hey why don't you put
13:17 - together some slides so we can share it
13:19 - so is that okay if we share these with
13:21 - you guys
13:22 - i think he would be really pumped and i
13:23 - think hopefully you guys will get a lot
13:25 - of value out of this too
13:27 - yeah and also guys let's drop alex a
13:28 - massive welcome in the comment section
13:31 - welcome to this team nice that's
13:34 - actually brilliant and drop a like
13:35 - for alex yeah drop a like
13:38 - nice so the first point guys first key
13:41 - principle of design a visual hierarchy
13:43 - so this is all about
13:44 - how do you rank elements on your page so
13:46 - here we have like a banner
13:47 - we have a header at the top and the sort
13:50 - of size and scale of these components
13:52 - they all play a different purpose like
13:53 - so for example we're always drawn
13:55 - to banners when we see like a website so
13:57 - they play a really important part
13:59 - it's really an important part of being a
14:00 - front-end developer yep and i just want
14:02 - to say guys we broke
14:03 - 700 live concurrent viewers so
14:07 - thank you guys so much that is insane
14:09 - appreciate you
14:11 - now visual hierarchy is very important
14:13 - and what's
14:14 - another thing that's super important
14:16 - right after visual hierarchy is
14:18 - actually the typography how things are
14:21 - written
14:22 - so if you take a look at how it you know
14:25 - slack replaces email inside your company
14:27 - that text matters it's bold and like
14:30 - it's kind of powerful
14:31 - you see it the size of it matters the
14:34 - styling of it matters and so
14:35 - typography is something you kind of have
14:37 - to know and if you look on the left hand
14:39 - side it says
14:40 - the style of fonts you use in your
14:41 - design can really impact your visual
14:43 - composition
14:44 - you can either help a message stand out
14:46 - with heavier weighted fonts
14:48 - or bring characters closer together to
14:50 - help the message feel more pronounced
14:52 - and i think when we see how it says try
14:55 - slack see the demo
14:56 - when we see where it says keep
14:57 - conversations organized in slack when
14:59 - you see slack replaces email
15:01 - how all of those are together and how
15:02 - typography is used it's very powerful
15:05 - yeah definitely definitely so typography
15:08 - super important guys and the next one is
15:10 - color so as you can see from this
15:12 - webpage immediately
15:13 - that thing just looks gorgeous like as
15:15 - soon as you see it it just
15:16 - grabs your eyes it grabs your full focus
15:19 - that's going to make
15:19 - all the difference guys now color is not
15:21 - just as simple as picking a color right
15:23 - you need to have like how do you figure
15:25 - out which colors to use how do you
15:26 - figure out which color palettes
15:27 - so on the next side we have a really
15:29 - handy tool that we actually used
15:31 - internally and it's called
15:32 - i don't know how you pronounce it i
15:33 - think it's coolers.com right rulers.co
15:35 - yeah yeah and cause you've used this
15:38 - right this is
15:39 - awesome you guys this is one tool that i
15:41 - think all designers should use and as a
15:43 - matter of fact i think i'm just going to
15:44 - open
15:44 - and go ahead and show it on the computer
15:47 - and how you use it
15:49 - but this thing is super powerful logan
15:51 - is here he goes my
15:52 - boy's dropping the value bomb let's go i
15:55 - mean you already know bro it's every day
15:57 - bro
15:57 - like the jake paul song he's actually
16:00 - there uh
16:00 - fbi just raided his house yesterday so
16:03 - let's go start the generator over here
16:07 - and this thing is awesome for colors i
16:10 - am not a front-end developer but even i
16:11 - was using this and this is awesome so
16:12 - check it out right
16:13 - if you want to pick a color that's good
16:15 - you can just click
16:17 - and how does it do that random
16:18 - generation again don't i think it's
16:22 - yeah so look i'm just pressing space bar
16:24 - and it's giving me these different
16:25 - colors and color palettes
16:27 - and so i'll keep going until i actually
16:28 - find something that kind of
16:30 - speaks out to me and um i want to use so
16:33 - let's
16:34 - even if you find the color you can lock
16:36 - that color and then you can keep
16:37 - you can keep sharpening so i like this
16:39 - orange because that's kind of like the
16:40 - clever programmer orange so now i can
16:42 - actually just do
16:44 - i can click it and it just locked it
16:46 - okay i could have also done command
16:47 - three
16:48 - command two will lock this one the
16:49 - second one so i'll just do command three
16:51 - and lock it
16:52 - now i just hit space bar and that orange
16:54 - will stay locked in but i've picked it
16:56 - now maybe i want something
16:57 - really sharp and crazy uh i like purples
17:01 - a lot so i'll lock this one too so now i
17:02 - have two of my colors and color palette
17:04 - picked
17:05 - and if i keep going you know this is you
17:07 - guys can see how this can be super
17:09 - useful for your website design logo
17:11 - design
17:12 - uh brand that you're trying to create
17:13 - whatever it may be
17:15 - yeah really really handy tool guys and
17:17 - it's really handy when you're just
17:18 - starting out in your sort of
17:19 - front-end journey because it's hard to
17:20 - figure out these things like the colors
17:22 - that you should use and stuff so
17:23 - definitely go ahead and check that out
17:25 - yep so coolers dot co is a great
17:27 - resource now what
17:28 - do we have uh here on this one sunny
17:31 - right so here we have contrast guys so
17:34 - you can see like
17:35 - so we talked about colors but look how
17:36 - they use the colors right look how
17:38 - they're contrasting different colors
17:39 - together
17:40 - and how it draws your attention to each
17:42 - of those three different uh items on the
17:43 - screen so
17:44 - contrast is something which could is
17:46 - really really important and how to know
17:48 - which colors
17:48 - that complement one another so in in
17:51 - that case you i think coolest does that
17:52 - by default so you notice whenever we're
17:54 - going through our palette
17:55 - it kind of with colors that was just
17:57 - seem naturally to fit together
17:58 - so use tools like that to sort of get a
18:01 - grasp of contrast
18:02 - but super important yeah and hari
18:04 - krishan just donated
18:06 - four dollars so thank you so much for
18:08 - that
18:09 - really really appreciate you that is
18:11 - freaking awesome good
18:12 - thank you and there's a good comment
18:15 - that came
18:16 - in from david breck and he actually says
18:19 - coolers is the best i used it for my
18:21 - final project last semester and it was
18:22 - looking
18:23 - really nice awesome awesome
18:26 - nice okay so let's move forward with
18:29 - this
18:30 - so number five grid systems these are
18:32 - really important now you guys hear us
18:34 - talking about grid systems in material
18:36 - ui
18:37 - or not just material ui but regular css
18:40 - we talked about grid
18:41 - and then even with bootstrap we talked
18:42 - about grid a lot
18:44 - and it's an important thing when you're
18:46 - designing
18:47 - you know even when you think about photo
18:49 - composition right you're thinking about
18:50 - rules of third
18:52 - rules of third is a grid system
18:54 - essentially
18:55 - so here for your own website design
18:59 - i think a grid system is important you
19:00 - want to add something on the grid system
19:02 - sony
19:03 - yeah so massive power here guys even for
19:06 - achieving responsive designs
19:08 - using a grid system allows you to
19:09 - actually really easily achieve that that
19:11 - sort of design that you're looking for
19:13 - so
19:13 - i know we talk a lot about flexbox but
19:15 - if you go ahead and master something
19:16 - like css grid
19:17 - achieving a responsive design is
19:18 - actually super super uh it's like it's
19:21 - very
19:21 - easy to do that with css grid so
19:23 - definitely something worth
19:24 - uh investing your time in and learning
19:26 - together
19:28 - lira fernandez says sunny plus cause the
19:30 - ultimate duo thank you and resvan says
19:33 - love your guys's content appreciate it
19:34 - brother so thank you
19:36 - next up now with gr i think grid systems
19:38 - is
19:39 - all important but like what kind of
19:41 - tools can you guys
19:42 - use to actually prototype grid systems
19:44 - and prototype
19:46 - and come up with design ideas for your
19:48 - website before you start coding it up
19:50 - so this is why we put this slide
19:52 - together for you guys
19:53 - tools for prototyping and um go ahead
19:57 - yeah just gonna say just how we say guys
19:59 - before you even write a line of code
20:01 - you should kind of like get an idea
20:02 - write it down on a piece of paper what
20:04 - you're trying to do right
20:05 - we do the same thing with design like
20:07 - with sketch with envision
20:09 - with adobe xd and and figma um pretty
20:12 - much
20:12 - you you that's what you go ahead and do
20:14 - you draw it out as you want to
20:16 - achieve your website they provide tools
20:17 - which allow you to
20:19 - go ahead and easily sort the layout
20:20 - without any code or anything
20:22 - and then you have something to work
20:23 - towards so this is
20:25 - this is adobe xd this is indesign
20:28 - uh this is envision envision got it this
20:32 - is figma over here and then this one is
20:34 - sketch yep
20:35 - yeah so design it first you guys before
20:38 - sometimes you just start creating though
20:40 - like
20:40 - oftentimes i personally kind of just
20:42 - jump into it but also i'm not
20:44 - a professional front end designer you
20:46 - know our front end developer so
20:48 - i think if you use these tools you make
20:49 - your uh development a lot better
20:52 - definitely definitely now here are some
20:54 - adobe
20:55 - xd resources so there's some go ahead
20:58 - you want to talk about it
21:00 - yeah so we have app integration guys
21:01 - slack jira
21:03 - um i can't remember what the last one
21:04 - was that well that's nice so you when
21:06 - you're designing you can actually just
21:08 - shoot it to your team in slack
21:09 - yeah and i actually worked in a company
21:11 - where they did this every time a design
21:13 - was updated it would ping in slack
21:14 - and i'd get the latest design really
21:16 - really handy stuff even ui kits guys so
21:19 - like
21:19 - all the apple designs all the microsoft
21:21 - designs all those things are
21:23 - built into these platforms so you can go
21:25 - ahead and get the apple layout as you
21:27 - just expect it
21:28 - uh um so alex actually went ahead and
21:30 - told me about one of the plugins for
21:31 - example if you want to have confetti on
21:33 - the screen
21:33 - or confetti on your design sometimes
21:35 - that can be quite hard to actually go
21:36 - ahead and add to your designs
21:38 - so there's little handy plugins that you
21:39 - can go ahead and install so just a quick
21:41 - showcase of the thing
21:42 - you can nice yep and then apparently it
21:46 - has a plug-in of air table
21:47 - and plug in a react so that's also
21:50 - sounds pretty handy and then it got ui
21:52 - kits for apple if you're developing for
21:54 - them
21:55 - or microsoft so this is awesome now
21:58 - also i think what's important that alex
22:00 - was telling me too
22:01 - it goes you got to have inspiration
22:03 - resources
22:04 - so where can you go and get inspiration
22:06 - from because one thing i see with
22:07 - front-end developers and why they
22:09 - sometimes they have good intentions but
22:11 - it end up ends up being bad
22:13 - because they're coming up with
22:14 - everything uniquely on their own and
22:16 - sometimes that's why your design will be
22:18 - bad
22:18 - so have inspirations to derive from so
22:21 - then you can actually create something
22:22 - really powerful and good
22:24 - yeah steve mccarthy says my front ends
22:27 - look like 1990s web pages
22:29 - i think every developer can relate to
22:30 - you on that and that's why we use
22:32 - the sort of things that we're about to
22:34 - speak about nice
22:36 - got it this is that's actually really
22:38 - small um that's funny because my
22:40 - stuff looks like that too and here is
22:42 - mostly search which is
22:43 - pinterest for designers have you ever
22:45 - used the sunny
22:47 - so i'm not using muesli i've used the
22:48 - one that we're going to speak about next
22:50 - but i definitely
22:51 - when alex mentioned this i'm going to
22:52 - check this one out sure yeah
22:54 - yep so this is like pinterest for
22:55 - designers and you guys can actually type
22:57 - in whatever keywords that you're looking
22:59 - for right and then inspirations will pop
23:02 - up and i think they have like landing
23:03 - pages and all that type of stuff
23:05 - for you to get inspiration from so i
23:08 - would definitely make
23:09 - mosley search one of your guys's
23:11 - resources for front end design and even
23:13 - sunny and i will personally add it to
23:15 - our toolbox yeah
23:17 - like guys they have like three and a
23:18 - half thousand dashboards ten thousand
23:20 - landing pages mobile app designs
23:22 - even if you have a rough idea of what
23:24 - your app should look like there's no
23:25 - harm in going and checking out
23:27 - a bunch of designs to see what could be
23:28 - improved you know yep
23:30 - 100 and guys i think we just broke 900
23:34 - concurrent
23:34 - viewers so thank you guys so much that
23:37 - is
23:38 - massive appreciate the love guys let's
23:40 - keep that energy up and let's keep
23:42 - getting this video out to even more
23:43 - people and you can just do that
23:45 - if you're here and you haven't liked the
23:47 - video already go ahead and just like the
23:49 - video and then it sends it out to more
23:51 - developers and more people who want to
23:52 - become developers
23:54 - thank you guys awesome thank you so here
23:57 - we have so the chrome extension for
23:59 - mosley is available too so you guys can
24:01 - just download it i believe for free
24:02 - and install it on chrome so you can do
24:05 - that it's called muesli to
24:06 - stay inspired and it has over 300 000
24:09 - plus active users
24:11 - yeah really handy now let's jump into
24:13 - some design resources
24:15 - so sunny take it away the first one that
24:17 - we have here guys is a design blog by
24:19 - adobe so it's completely free to go
24:21 - ahead and read this
24:22 - subscribe to it and what we always do is
24:24 - we actually recommend this with
24:25 - javascript so
24:26 - there's a few javascript newsletters and
24:27 - that's what i personally use
24:29 - to stay at the front of the javascript
24:31 - and what's latest and what's going on so
24:33 - this is the exact same thing but for
24:34 - design and as a front-end developer
24:36 - super important guys it's going to teach
24:38 - you the latest processes the latest
24:40 - principles
24:41 - and also what the latest companies are
24:42 - doing in regards to design right so
24:45 - really really important
24:46 - to stay up to like in front of the in
24:48 - front of the crowd when it comes to this
24:50 - stuff
24:50 - like the type of stuff that i'm looking
24:52 - at right now that seems actually pretty
24:53 - powerful to me i mean
24:55 - that stuff's just catching my eyes
24:56 - unique insights so for example i want to
24:59 - know about interviews
25:00 - and how did they interview people based
25:02 - on design how did somebody pass the
25:04 - interview
25:05 - based on that i think that seems pretty
25:08 - amazing for somebody who's looking for a
25:10 - job
25:11 - yep definitely here are some great
25:14 - free design resources you guys and so
25:17 - if you have any um you want to add
25:19 - anything sunny feel free to
25:21 - jump in at any time but yeah so we have
25:24 - behance and dribble
25:25 - for those yeah i'm just going gonna say
25:27 - behance is one i gotta
25:29 - put in my uh repertoire as well but
25:32 - behance is absolutely amazing you guys
25:34 - so make sure you guys
25:35 - add that as one of your resources and
25:37 - then the next one is actually dribble
25:39 - dribble is
25:40 - amazing let me actually just open up
25:43 - because i have
25:44 - some experience with dribble and these
25:46 - guys
25:47 - are is triple with three b's
25:50 - it's three b's yeah three b's yeah there
25:53 - we go so it's dribble with three b's
25:55 - and you guys can go here and get
25:57 - inspirations for what you're trying to
25:59 - build so maybe let's say you're trying
26:00 - to build like
26:01 - that uh bottom nav bar or whatever on
26:04 - your mobile device and you can actually
26:06 - take a look at this
26:07 - inspiration right here or if you're
26:09 - trying to build a landing page
26:11 - you can take a look at this design yeah
26:14 - that somebody built
26:15 - you go oh that actually looks really
26:17 - great let me actually model this
26:19 - so if you look at the top and what i
26:22 - would honestly do is i would go to this
26:23 - platform
26:24 - and let's see if i can go in filters
26:27 - cool popular maybe you can go click web
26:31 - design right
26:32 - and go to the most popular web designs
26:34 - that you can see so
26:35 - say this one then just try to design
26:38 - this exact thing that looks exactly like
26:41 - that and put it in your portfolio
26:44 - see what i'm saying that will guaranteed
26:47 - work
26:47 - because it's already popping on the
26:50 - design website
26:52 - yeah one of the most popular ones the
26:54 - best thing is is that these are going to
26:55 - be less
26:56 - popular than the sort of typical sort of
26:58 - projects that you're going to see in
26:59 - everyone's portfolio so if you go here
27:01 - you're going to be sure that you have
27:02 - some pieces which stand out
27:04 - inside your portfolio and they're really
27:06 - attractive really look beautiful
27:08 - and it's also going to make you a better
27:09 - front-end developer so no harm in doing
27:11 - it
27:12 - yeah no harm in doing this like this is
27:14 - another one and i think that's a really
27:16 - good point that sunny made because
27:17 - sometimes
27:18 - if everybody is making clones of things
27:20 - sometimes your
27:21 - those people will be like well you
27:22 - probably just follow the tutorial you
27:24 - know to do this or you just follow the
27:25 - to-do list tutorial
27:27 - but here it's not everybody's doing it
27:29 - so this will also make you stand out if
27:31 - you try to exactly model these pages
27:34 - yeah that will be a really good test for
27:36 - you guys
27:37 - so let's go back to the keynote that we
27:41 - had for you guys and i think
27:43 - i mean damn we're almost at a thousand
27:45 - total viewers on all platforms
27:48 - so that is amazing unbelievable
27:51 - unbelievable thank you guys so these are
27:54 - free resources
27:55 - and then you might be wondering like how
27:57 - can i improve my visual design skills
28:00 - and this is something we just touched on
28:02 - a little bit already
28:04 - so make sure you discover creative work
28:06 - on these platforms
28:08 - i think inspiration is probably going to
28:09 - be one of the most important things
28:12 - and then you know what the next most
28:14 - important thing is even within
28:16 - inspiration right you want to find
28:19 - few people and then model them so
28:22 - tell me your thoughts on this one sonny
28:25 - i think this is a really important point
28:26 - i never thought of this until alex
28:28 - explained it to me so like
28:29 - go ahead and find some designers and
28:31 - follow them because like he mentioned to
28:33 - me it's all about pattern recognition
28:35 - if you start to see and you follow their
28:37 - designs you're going to see
28:38 - where they go from like a rounded design
28:40 - to a flat design and if you're following
28:42 - three people and all of them are moving
28:43 - in that direction
28:44 - you can you can be sure that the
28:46 - industry might be switching to that
28:47 - direction
28:48 - and it's like a queue to then learn that
28:49 - stuff and go a bit more deeper into it
28:51 - just like how you follow me follow kazee
28:53 - nars in the javascript domain
28:56 - it's just as important in like visual
28:57 - design domain that you go ahead and
28:58 - follow someone so these are
29:00 - people on dribble and alex recommended
29:02 - that you guys go and follow these so
29:04 - definitely go and check him out um and
29:05 - he's an amazing designer and he actually
29:07 - goes and follows these people as well so
29:09 - be sure to go
29:10 - it's super killer because even one of
29:12 - the things that i learned when i'm
29:14 - looking for homes is we couldn't find a
29:17 - lot of good listings so what we did is
29:19 - we found the owner
29:20 - of a home that was like nice and we hit
29:23 - up the owner and the owner just showed
29:24 - us
29:24 - all other homes that were similarly
29:27 - amazingly designed
29:29 - oh nice you know what i'm saying so i
29:31 - think with when you're looking for
29:32 - website designs
29:33 - just follow a few people and then you
29:35 - can actually start to develop that same
29:37 - eye
29:38 - as them and you will guaranteed almost
29:41 - always find
29:42 - good principle designs because you're
29:43 - following the right people
29:45 - definitely and the next one is sunny
29:48 - what is this
29:49 - go ahead and build some app clones guys
29:52 - so
29:52 - if you haven't already we have actually
29:54 - gone ahead and built all of the clones
29:56 - on the screen right now
29:57 - so which is amazing to say that really
29:59 - nice yeah you guys so nice to look at it
30:02 - yeah it's really nice you guys can go
30:04 - ahead and build those and go and check
30:06 - them out and that's going to help you
30:07 - become a better
30:08 - front-end developer and it's going to
30:09 - help you improve your skill set so
30:11 - seriously and it's going to it's going
30:12 - to be something you add to your
30:13 - portfolio so definitely go ahead and
30:14 - check those because we built netflix we
30:16 - built tinder clone just a few days ago
30:18 - we built spotify cloned
30:20 - we built tick-tock clone and instagram
30:22 - clone so these are all websites that we
30:24 - built
30:24 - and the front end for them so what
30:26 - better than to have these on your
30:28 - portfolio
30:29 - exactly awesome so with that said we're
30:32 - gonna jump back
30:34 - into this pretty much uh right away
30:37 - thank you for the donation basil
30:39 - straight back into oh thank you
30:41 - basil islam nice and you guys we're
30:44 - about to hit a
30:45 - thousand concurrent viewers on youtube
30:48 - very soon we're at
30:49 - 971 you guys are absolutely freaking
30:51 - beautiful daniel sulliada says awesome
30:53 - stream guys i believe
30:55 - most web developers are not great
30:57 - designers would it be beneficial for a
30:59 - web dev to learn ui ux design
31:01 - and what we will say is absolutely i
31:03 - think it's one of the key components
31:04 - you could have hidden in your back
31:06 - pocket you come in as a full stack
31:08 - developer or back-end developer and then
31:10 - you just
31:11 - blow their minds with your design skills
31:13 - yeah it's what takes you from a junior
31:15 - front-end developer to a senior
31:17 - front-end developer
31:18 - having that difference in that visual
31:19 - skill yeah yep so i think it's
31:21 - absolutely killer guys thank you so much
31:24 - drop a like for the video if you're here
31:26 - and you've been enjoying this content
31:27 - let's keep
31:28 - sending it out to more and more people
31:29 - let's break that thousand mark and with
31:31 - that said
31:32 - let's continue with the value bombs
31:35 - so watching base now onto
31:39 - the back to the technical stuff guys so
31:41 - back to the technical nigrate
31:43 - what the hell is a framework guys we
31:46 - always
31:46 - are asking like which framework do i
31:48 - learn is it like
31:50 - angular view react javascript's always
31:52 - evolving it's always changing
31:54 - so how do you know which one which
31:56 - framework to start on and kazi like when
31:57 - you first entered this domain
31:58 - what was your thoughts on that i was
32:01 - very confused with all especially the
32:03 - web development
32:04 - it was just like i'm like let me just do
32:05 - python because python was just python
32:08 - and then web development was like
32:10 - view react angular this that that
32:13 - other thing and i'm like that seems like
32:15 - too much
32:16 - is going on yeah exactly there's a lot
32:19 - going on so we're gonna we're here to
32:20 - clear that up for you today guys on what
32:22 - you should focus
32:23 - all of your attention on so here are the
32:25 - most popular go ahead
32:27 - the most popular ones that we're going
32:28 - to cover guys are the first one you've
32:30 - probably heard of this angular
32:31 - it's google's uh framework right so you
32:34 - have google's framework it's very
32:35 - popular
32:36 - it grew quite a lot but it's sort of on
32:39 - the downward trend right now
32:40 - and then they had a view um i'm not
32:43 - actually sure because
32:43 - you know who actually came up with the
32:44 - view i'm not entirely sure i don't know
32:46 - who came out with
32:47 - you very lightweight uh library
32:50 - extremely sort of popular it's very
32:51 - opinionated
32:52 - um but it sort of surpassed angular and
32:55 - then the guys at facebook just came
32:57 - along and just like
32:58 - blew everyone's mind with like react
33:02 - like they came along i love this and
33:04 - they just took it to a whole new level
33:06 - you know like
33:08 - they um have we have have we gone to the
33:10 - next slide
33:11 - we're on react oh nice yeah awesome yeah
33:15 - so yeah this one
33:16 - guys this is by the guys over at
33:17 - facebook and this is obviously if you're
33:19 - not
33:19 - if you're new to the channel go ahead
33:21 - and check out the last few videos and
33:22 - we'll clear up what react is
33:24 - uh yeah so yeah massive companies are
33:26 - using all three of these right now guys
33:28 - so you've got
33:29 - airbnb instagram ubereats dropbox using
33:32 - react
33:32 - you've got guardian upwork paypal sony
33:34 - using angular and then you've got
33:35 - alibaba and a bunch of others using vue
33:37 - but how do you know
33:39 - which one to choose from these so like
33:41 - what would you look at when you were
33:42 - when you would make this decision
33:44 - that's really important i honestly a few
33:46 - things i always look at which is why i
33:48 - looked at python as well
33:49 - i look for simplicity and ease of use
33:53 - i almost put that above so many other
33:55 - things
33:56 - just because i want to know how what's
33:59 - the learning curve can i
34:00 - pick it up fast and then i also look at
34:02 - how long is this thing here to stay
34:04 - so like is it popular is it picked up by
34:06 - a lot of people and then of course i
34:08 - want to look at like what companies
34:10 - you know are using it so when i see like
34:12 - i look at the guardian and i'm like
34:13 - that's cool but airbnb is like more
34:15 - badass you know like upwork is cute but
34:18 - instagram is really where it's at yeah
34:20 - exactly
34:22 - yeah so i mean i think all of them are
34:25 - being used by popular
34:26 - but i strive for simplicity and um
34:30 - something that's just
34:32 - you know popular and trending right now
34:35 - exactly so with that said guys we went
34:37 - ahead and checked out stack overflow
34:39 - and wanted to see what the most wanted
34:41 - framework was and you guys guessed it
34:43 - right
34:43 - whoa we just broke 1 000 viewers
34:47 - concurrent we're over 1 000 viewers on
34:50 - youtube you guys are
34:51 - absolutely amazing thank you so much
34:53 - thank you guys damn
34:55 - that is amazing let's keep it rolling so
34:57 - go ahead
34:58 - thank you guys so the number one most
35:01 - wanted framework
35:02 - right now is flying with react right so
35:04 - yeah at the top
35:05 - you've got react so guys there is no
35:08 - downfall right now to learn and react
35:10 - react is here to stay
35:11 - you can be sure for the next five years
35:12 - if you learn react you're gonna have a
35:14 - job but you're gonna have some kind of
35:15 - income
35:16 - that will come from that so definitely
35:18 - worth investing your time
35:19 - yep and it's the most wanted framework
35:22 - now if we go over here you guys can see
35:24 - react is just flying off and this is
35:27 - actually like
35:28 - look this is the real download so this
35:30 - is not just some popularity this is
35:32 - literally download so take a look at
35:33 - this versus angular versus view
35:36 - and honestly a lot of the reason with
35:38 - angular is because it's too
35:39 - um it's it forces you into a framework
35:43 - and it forces you to code a certain way
35:46 - whereas with react
35:47 - it's not a framework it's just a library
35:49 - it's super lightweight
35:50 - so it's plug and play and then it's also
35:52 - a badass
35:54 - and you know you it's pretty much just
35:56 - like javascript under the hood
35:58 - yeah so next time you guys have that
36:00 - question should i learn angular should i
36:01 - learn view
36:02 - think about this like visual right here
36:04 - like angular is going off
36:06 - react is going off the chart oh there we
36:09 - go
36:09 - okay this visual right here okay i think
36:11 - you were talking about this visual
36:13 - because i'm like that other visual makes
36:15 - me not wanna
36:17 - you know if you guys loved it drop a
36:20 - thumbs up
36:21 - warrior warrior says this is insane you
36:23 - guys are lit we're always lit somebody
36:25 - also said this is like
36:26 - watching two friends just kind of give
36:27 - us advice so that's cool
36:29 - yeah i love that it is guys there's two
36:31 - friends just giving you guys advice
36:33 - amazing so what what is this over here
36:35 - right so yeah so we talked about react
36:37 - so we're gonna dive a bit more into
36:38 - react guys
36:39 - so react is all about component based
36:42 - design and what that means guys is
36:44 - literally you
36:44 - go ahead and break a website down into
36:46 - different components the header the
36:48 - navbar
36:49 - the body the text and all that goes in
36:51 - like the cards on amazon
36:52 - all of those things and you basically
36:54 - just reuse them right so it's literally
36:56 - like
36:56 - once you get the hang of that the reason
36:58 - why it's really really relates it guys
37:00 - it's actually super simple it's actually
37:01 - really easy to go ahead and reuse
37:03 - components
37:04 - so getting your head around the
37:06 - component based design is crucial
37:08 - now managing data and react like how
37:11 - does this work
37:12 - so when it comes to managing data and
37:14 - redux this is where people start to kind
37:16 - of lose their and start going crazy
37:18 - and this is why in our clones that we
37:21 - make
37:22 - like amazon clone where we use context
37:24 - api
37:25 - where we start to introduce the idea of
37:26 - redux and we
37:28 - built another tutorial i think with
37:30 - spotify where we use
37:32 - context api so this is another concept
37:35 - which introduces things like data layers
37:36 - and you needing to understand that which
37:38 - is
37:39 - super powerful and super valuable once
37:41 - you learn it and
37:42 - the step-by-step process of learning is
37:44 - learn context api
37:45 - first and then get into redux and is the
37:48 - easiest way to do it send me your
37:49 - thoughts on this
37:50 - exactly what cause you said pretty much
37:52 - so guys well the minute the minute you
37:54 - kind of hear about redux and you look at
37:55 - tutorials for redux
37:56 - this is your reaction it's pretty much
37:58 - like oh my god like it's kind of
37:59 - freaking me out and stuff
38:00 - so all we're going to say here is pretty
38:02 - much like kazi said go ahead learn the
38:04 - react context api
38:05 - first learn that pattern and then
38:08 - picking out redux is kind of easy so
38:09 - it's gonna it's gonna be a lot simpler
38:11 - than as if you were just jumping
38:12 - straight into
38:13 - redux for the first time so the next one
38:15 - yeah react context api it's going to be
38:17 - a lot
38:18 - easier to learn and pick up um and if
38:20 - you are interested
38:21 - in the builds that we've done we
38:22 - actually went ahead and done that so
38:24 - you can definitely use those as
38:25 - reference yep and you you know we have a
38:28 - free training for you guys
38:29 - profit with javascript free training so
38:31 - you guys can go ahead and
38:33 - sign up for it at any time we have a
38:35 - webinar that we've put together it's a
38:37 - one hour
38:38 - free webinar it's in the description
38:39 - below so if you guys want to go
38:41 - ahead and check that out definitely go
38:44 - ahead and sign up for it because it just
38:45 - gives you the exact road map
38:47 - to you know here we're diving deep into
38:50 - the front end developer guide in your
38:52 - roadmap in that one we're talking about
38:54 - how are you going to go from your
38:55 - zero dollars to making a hundred
38:57 - thousand dollars
38:58 - whether you do that in one year three
39:00 - years or five years it's really the road
39:02 - map
39:02 - to learning the coding skills and the
39:04 - practicality of
39:06 - your first hundred thousand dollars so i
39:08 - put that in the description below
39:11 - click that link and then sign up for
39:12 - that training it's freaking awesome
39:15 - definitely go check that out guys free
39:17 - value so definitely worth checking out
39:18 - now i included this one because i have a
39:21 - lot of people who do ask about something
39:23 - called mob
39:23 - x right i had a question about it before
39:25 - uh it says basically another
39:27 - uh opinionated version of like managing
39:29 - data within a react app
39:30 - honestly my my viewpoint here is if
39:32 - anyone has this question
39:34 - go ahead and use react context api and
39:35 - then redux if you want to do this
39:37 - it's just kind of a cool thing to learn
39:39 - but honestly if you want to land a job
39:40 - redux is the way to go got it
39:44 - and now check out the live bills that we
39:46 - have free
39:47 - on youtube all right so bruce buffer is
39:50 - endorsing us apparently and over here
39:52 - you can see we got the zoom clone i mean
39:55 - i know it's really hard for you guys to
39:56 - see but
39:57 - we got the zoom clone that we made
39:58 - recently we made a spotify clone for you
40:01 - guys
40:02 - we made the tick tock clone uh that's
40:05 - at you know in six days we have over 117
40:08 - 000 people watched that one and
40:10 - a lot of them built it out we built a
40:13 - youtube clone for you guys you can see
40:15 - the exact front-end design for youtube
40:17 - and then we also did the tinder clone
40:20 - and then
40:20 - a bunch of more stuff so go ahead and
40:23 - guys like that's
40:24 - all there for free on youtube so make
40:26 - sure you get value from that as well
40:28 - exactly and guys if you were if you've
40:30 - watched any of these and you found value
40:31 - from that just
40:32 - all we ask is you smash the thumbs up
40:34 - button and that's enough for us
40:36 - to break break the thumbs up button
40:39 - exactly
40:41 - now okay so what's this what am i
40:43 - looking at all right so next guys we
40:45 - have design libraries
40:46 - so what are design libraries they help
40:48 - us achieve that clean
40:50 - ui they help us to achieve things like
40:52 - that grid system that we spoke about
40:54 - earlier
40:55 - so here are two popular ones one's
40:56 - called material ui ones called bootstrap
40:58 - now they give us things like icon sets
41:00 - so we can use like we've used it in a
41:02 - lot of our builds
41:03 - so like having those clean flat buttons
41:05 - which have the responsive click and that
41:06 - google sort of ripple effect
41:08 - and also that responsive design both
41:10 - material ui and bootstrap are going to
41:11 - help you achieve that
41:12 - now we spoke about react both of them
41:15 - are very very heavily supported with
41:16 - react they have
41:17 - a react bootstrap and material ui out by
41:20 - default supports react so
41:22 - definitely worth something looking into
41:23 - guys
41:25 - yep awesome so now we have
41:28 - node and npm so now let's talk about
41:31 - what is node and what is npm is it on
41:34 - the next slides or do we got to talk
41:35 - about it now
41:36 - uh no it's on here so node guys in case
41:38 - you're wondering because i know it can
41:39 - be confusing when you see javascript and
41:41 - node.js you're like oh
41:43 - i mean aren't they the same thing right
41:44 - so we talked about earlier front-end
41:46 - development is in javascript
41:48 - whenever you have any back-end software
41:49 - any any code which sits on the server
41:51 - somewhere
41:52 - that's node.js so that's like living on
41:54 - a server somewhere and it runs in
41:56 - something called node.js
41:57 - now mpm is how you pull in essentially
42:00 - other packages and other modules
42:02 - into your code so if you're going to use
42:03 - material ui or bootstrap you would use
42:05 - npm now npm stands for node package
42:08 - manager and it basically
42:09 - whenever you write a piece of code that
42:11 - you want to share with others you store
42:12 - it on
42:13 - the node registry and then other people
42:15 - can go ahead and pull it
42:16 - so definitely what we do use that in
42:19 - everything
42:19 - 100 now over here we got
42:23 - npm and we got yarn and oftentimes
42:26 - people say how do i choose so how do you
42:28 - choose sunny
42:29 - right so this is very sort of
42:30 - opinionated uh yarn is
42:32 - quite a powerful one to use it's very
42:34 - clean actually and i used to be a
42:36 - firm believer in sticking with mpm but i
42:38 - would actually go ahead and use yarn but
42:40 - guys whatever you decide to use just
42:41 - stick to the one like then you can learn
42:43 - both there's no harm at all
42:44 - um but don't have your project and
42:46 - sometimes you do npm sometimes you do
42:48 - yarn
42:48 - just stick to one and that's going to be
42:51 - um you're sort of
42:52 - clear enough and and guys if you're
42:53 - going to a job and they're using yarn
42:55 - carry on using yarn if you're going to a
42:56 - job they're using npm karen using npm
42:58 - it's really not a big decision and it's
43:00 - not as scary as everyone thinks
43:02 - yep travel todd says travel tools says i
43:06 - was
43:07 - zero in react i watched all the clones
43:09 - now i know react
43:10 - context api and he says sunny's way of
43:12 - teaching is the best on youtube
43:15 - i love that thank you so much travel
43:17 - tools so go watch those
43:19 - yeah definitely go ahead and check those
43:20 - out love that now what is firebase and
43:23 - why is it so
43:24 - useful for a front-end developer now
43:26 - guys what's beautiful about
43:27 - firebase this thing is going to blow
43:29 - your mind is you actually don't even
43:31 - need
43:31 - a back-end like node you can actually do
43:35 - real-time database you can do user
43:37 - authentication
43:38 - you can do um pretty much everything you
43:41 - could do with the normal data
43:42 - including hosting your website you can
43:45 - do all of that
43:46 - with firebase yeah massive value here
43:50 - guys so firebase is provided by google
43:52 - a bunch of different tools are included
43:54 - in firebase and
43:55 - literally what kazi said is what they do
43:57 - so it's pretty much they wanted to
43:58 - alleviate and get rid of that headache
44:00 - with the back end and sort of you they
44:02 - just want you to focus on your front-end
44:04 - developer they want you to make
44:05 - beautiful apps and make it simple for
44:06 - you to deploy them
44:07 - host them handle authentication and all
44:09 - that stuff so we're going to run through
44:10 - some of the things that firebase offer
44:12 - which can help you as a front-end
44:13 - developer
44:14 - yep so firebase can do hosting
44:18 - and it also allows you to think 100
44:21 - million
44:22 - users and you guys should also think
44:23 - about 100 million users always
44:26 - so when your app has 100 million users
44:28 - can it handle it and with firebase the
44:30 - answer is yes it can actually handle it
44:32 - and it do it automatically for you
44:35 - exactly scales up scales down
44:37 - just by itself so very simple to go
44:39 - ahead and do that we also have the cloud
44:41 - of
44:41 - uh we have the real-time firestore
44:43 - database so guys
44:44 - this is amazing like power behind this
44:46 - and i don't think anyone realizes until
44:48 - you actually go ahead and play with it
44:50 - without doing any back-end stuff you get
44:52 - a real-time database so like literally
44:54 - if you've got
44:55 - messages coming through you don't have
44:56 - to do any magic behind that it will just
44:58 - come through inside
45:00 - on your front end with very minimal code
45:01 - like literally three lines of code
45:03 - and you can have something coming
45:04 - through so extreme power at the
45:06 - real-time database
45:07 - and what's up with this yeah so here
45:10 - guys
45:11 - a lot of you guys are asking about
45:12 - machine learning can we do it can we do
45:14 - it or like
45:15 - do we need python if you guys are
45:16 - interested in machine learning you can
45:18 - combine something called tensorflow.js
45:20 - which is a way of uh training models in
45:22 - machine learning
45:23 - with the uh with firebase and you can
45:25 - actually have really really powerful
45:27 - machine learning
45:28 - uh functionality with jacked front end
45:31 - developer
45:33 - yeah like all of this is like crazy guys
45:35 - like you can do all of this very simply
45:36 - and on the next slide
45:38 - there's a little diagram showing you
45:39 - about how we can train a model
45:41 - and then we can serve it using firebase
45:43 - so really powerful stuff the training is
45:45 - taking place here
45:46 - right and then serving is all happening
45:47 - with firebase and firebase is all front
45:49 - end like what
45:51 - what is happening what is life so that's
45:53 - the beautiful thing so even if you don't
45:55 - understand machine learning you're
45:55 - sitting you're going what am i looking
45:57 - at
45:58 - doesn't matter like the whole idea is
45:59 - that with firebase it's possible so even
46:01 - if you learned it later
46:02 - you could do it just to tell you how far
46:05 - you can push it with this
46:06 - authentication dude check this out
46:09 - marouche
46:10 - says sunny and kazi i got promoted
46:11 - yesterday because of learning react from
46:13 - your tinder clone
46:14 - many things it's amazing
46:17 - well done dude we love that we helped
46:19 - you out that's amazing
46:21 - uh let me actually see this um
46:25 - that's awesome yeah i got maroosa sunny
46:27 - and yeah i got promoted that's awesome
46:29 - thank you so much dude
46:30 - i'm i'm pumped for you that's huge
46:33 - we got frank in the house paton says wow
46:35 - this guy is coding in 2021
46:38 - you know us we're in the future we'll
46:40 - wait for everybody else to catch up
46:42 - guys we're all in the future everybody
46:43 - who's here it's the culture
46:45 - we're freaking driven we're grateful
46:47 - we're all pumped
46:49 - that's the culture that we're building
46:50 - in the team and i feel like that's what
46:52 - we have even in the community
46:54 - exactly on the user authentication side
46:57 - guys i imagine as a front-end developer
46:59 - you can actually add
47:00 - google authentication facebook
47:02 - authentication twitter authentication
47:04 - github regular email or even with the
47:07 - phone
47:08 - like all of this you guys can add with
47:11 - firebase
47:12 - and it's super simple to be able to do
47:14 - that with firebase
47:15 - yeah as a full stack developer guys i
47:17 - can tell you at first hand
47:19 - doing that is not a simple task but
47:21 - firebase make it
47:22 - extremely simple to do user
47:25 - authentication so save yourself the
47:26 - hassle
47:27 - use firebase when you're doing it
47:29 - exactly and thank you
47:31 - frankie for removing those messages
47:32 - because i was about to do that guys keep
47:34 - the chat positive otherwise you're going
47:35 - to get blocked
47:36 - we want the culture to be just filled
47:38 - with positive and amazing people
47:40 - so let's keep the positivity going we
47:42 - read all of your comments
47:43 - if you want to be a part of this
47:44 - community bring positivity bring love
47:47 - and those are the people that are more
47:48 - than welcome here
47:50 - cloud functions with firebase i mean you
47:52 - can actually do this
47:53 - from front end and this essentially
47:55 - allows you to be able to do
47:57 - all the backend functionality you could
47:59 - ever dream of
48:01 - cloud functions allow you to do that and
48:02 - they allow you to do it kind of from the
48:04 - front end so
48:05 - that's a really beautiful thing anything
48:08 - else you want to touch base on with this
48:09 - before we move forward
48:11 - um just really powerful basically if you
48:12 - ever need some back-end functionality
48:14 - guys
48:14 - don't go ahead and start up an express
48:16 - server or something like that
48:17 - your your answer would be in cloud
48:19 - functions in case anyone was wondering
48:21 - that so definitely go ahead
48:22 - and learn those if you're interested in
48:23 - doing some kind of back end with your
48:25 - front end
48:25 - yup uh here is an amazing
48:28 - uh comment from the good gamer
48:32 - and he says i got a job as a developer
48:36 - thanks qazi i've not done any tutorials
48:38 - but i followed your other videos and
48:40 - django course
48:41 - damn amazing nice that is amazing man
48:45 - pumped to hear that well done so
48:48 - let's go here now now storage
48:51 - firebase also allows you to do all the
48:53 - storage so when you're storing
48:55 - media when you want your media to be
48:58 - optimized and served in the fastest way
49:01 - possible firebase handles that when you
49:04 - want to have a database
49:05 - and you want to store things videos
49:07 - anything like that firebase can handle
49:09 - that for you as well
49:10 - yeah exactly they do google on it they
49:13 - do a bunch of analytics and test lab
49:15 - stuff so analytics
49:17 - keeping track of your users who's doing
49:18 - what on your on your platform is
49:20 - massively useful and insightful
49:21 - especially as your business grows
49:23 - firebase test lab guys if you build an
49:25 - app firebase test lab literally will
49:28 - check that app across so many different
49:31 - physical devices
49:32 - and it will show you screenshots of how
49:34 - the app looks on every single one of
49:36 - those devices
49:37 - automatically which is insane like
49:39 - that's really really insane
49:40 - really powerful especially when you're
49:41 - sort of you want your app to work on
49:43 - everyone's device
49:44 - and be universal so really really
49:46 - powerful stuff
49:47 - super powerful henrik says do you have a
49:50 - tutorial using firebase almost every
49:53 - single
49:53 - one of our clones that we built on our
49:55 - youtube channel over the last few weeks
49:57 - you guys can go and watch them tick tock
49:59 - instagram
50:00 - um facebook messenger clone tinder clone
50:03 - netflix clone all of them pretty much
50:05 - are using firebase
50:06 - so you can watch them they're amazing
50:08 - tutorials on how to use firebase
50:10 - yep exactly it allows you to grow your
50:12 - business it allows you a b
50:14 - testing cloud messaging in-app messaging
50:16 - all that good stuff comes with firebase
50:19 - built in now what's the best part about
50:22 - firebase do you guys want to know
50:25 - exactly well let's go for it and what is
50:27 - that sonny
50:28 - guys it's free it's fast and it's easy
50:31 - to use
50:32 - free to a limit guys so all the use
50:34 - cases which you guys are probably going
50:35 - to be using it for
50:36 - completely free so you guys can go ahead
50:38 - even deploying your apps guys
50:40 - it will give you a really beautiful
50:42 - little url which is actually completely
50:44 - fine to keep that url
50:45 - as your primary url and you can pretty
50:47 - much host it forever for free
50:49 - so definitely and it's the easiest
50:51 - hosting solution i've ever seen
50:53 - when it comes to a web app so definitely
50:54 - worth going ahead and doing that
50:56 - agreed now let's move on into which code
50:59 - editor should i
51:00 - use because we've talked about firebase
51:03 - and i think firebase is phenomenal and
51:05 - hopefully you guys love that too
51:06 - but i think one thing a lot of people
51:08 - want to know is what code editor should
51:10 - i use so here we got
51:12 - you know that code editor war should i
51:14 - use webstorm should i use visual studio
51:16 - code sublime or adam
51:18 - what do you recommend sunny so i was
51:20 - actually i've kind of gone through a
51:22 - bunch of these i use sublime at one
51:23 - point i use atom
51:25 - but now my by far guys just for the
51:27 - simplicity of
51:28 - how you add on extensions and sort of
51:30 - the the growth of it
51:32 - uh vs code guys vs code is so powerful
51:34 - it's ridiculous like i would really
51:36 - really recommend and we're going to run
51:37 - through some of the stuff
51:38 - as to some of the reasons as to why
51:41 - we're firm believers that it's
51:42 - definitely the best code
51:44 - for you guys yep and here now we're
51:46 - going to jump into also the extensions
51:48 - that are actually the most powerful for
51:50 - vs code
51:51 - i think one extension alone makes it
51:54 - that you can't go and look anywhere else
51:56 - the one extension that comes to my mind
51:58 - is called live share
51:59 - this alone makes me feel like you can
52:01 - never use anything like adam is just
52:03 - like
52:03 - it seems like it's from 1930s now uh
52:06 - yeah so does
52:07 - every other editor that i could dream of
52:09 - the live share
52:10 - means sunny and i can code remotely he's
52:13 - in london i'm in us
52:14 - on the same freaking code editor and it
52:17 - feels like your local host it's not
52:19 - screen share
52:20 - it's not team viewer it's literally the
52:22 - same exact thing so he's seeing it in
52:24 - perfect resolution
52:26 - he has access to my command line my
52:28 - localhost 3000
52:30 - and even when my browser localhost 3000
52:32 - is up he can actually view the website
52:34 - and everything
52:35 - exactly guys it's so powerful and just
52:38 - for that one extension alone
52:39 - it's worth downloading and just giving
52:41 - it a try so really really powerful stuff
52:43 - we've got a few others which are not
52:45 - worth mentioning we've got prettier so a
52:47 - lot of us hate doing that indentation
52:49 - we hate adding spaces how many stuff is
52:51 - very opinionated
52:52 - so like we just want it so when you hit
52:54 - save it just formats all your code and
52:55 - keeps it concise
52:56 - pretty it does that for you really
52:58 - really handy stuff
53:00 - um any others worth mentioning here qazi
53:02 - the other ones that i think are worth
53:03 - mentioning here
53:04 - i like brackets a lot so in javascript
53:07 - and react and all this one thing that
53:09 - was annoying to me as a python user is
53:11 - like
53:11 - oh my god so many freaking squiggly
53:14 - brackets
53:15 - and parentheses and it's insane
53:19 - and then semicolons and you miss one of
53:21 - those and your code just doesn't work
53:22 - and it's hard to see it's hard to
53:24 - visualize
53:25 - so what this does is it gives you
53:28 - matching brackets so you guys see how
53:29 - this red one over here closes this red
53:31 - one right over there
53:32 - right and then the yellow one closes the
53:34 - yellow one so each bracket having its
53:36 - own color
53:37 - is very very useful because you know
53:40 - where easily it opens where it closes
53:41 - and you never will have that problem
53:43 - again
53:44 - another extension that's important to
53:46 - mention is
53:48 - this snippets one where for react it's
53:51 - super important where you can just do
53:52 - rfce and boom it just makes a component
53:55 - for you
53:55 - i think that's pretty damn handy but in
53:58 - terms of the usefulness of it like i
54:00 - think
54:01 - you know all of these are pretty
54:02 - important the ones we use the most is
54:04 - prettier
54:06 - i think another one that gets used a lot
54:07 - if you're doing remote programming is
54:09 - live
54:10 - share and then i would say uh the
54:12 - snippets and then the brackets
54:14 - yeah exactly so on the next side we
54:17 - touch base on pretty much what we spoke
54:18 - about the lentis and formats that you
54:20 - need
54:21 - are prettier eslint and es7 snippets in
54:24 - my opinion they are really really
54:25 - something which is going to dial you in
54:27 - and make you much faster of what you do
54:29 - also one that we haven't put on here
54:31 - guys i think it's built into vs code by
54:32 - default it's called emit
54:34 - emit is really powerful guys it's how we
54:36 - you'll see when i'm coding sometimes
54:37 - i'll just write div
54:39 - dot and then i'll have some stuff on
54:40 - there and it's very very powerful in
54:42 - in order to write html very fast so
54:44 - definitely worth checking out
54:46 - cool so these are your linters right
54:48 - eslant
54:49 - prettier and es7 snippets so you guys
54:52 - can use these
54:53 - these are good for linting and
54:54 - formatting and what that means is some
54:56 - of them will check your code
54:58 - so i think prettier will format your
55:00 - code and make it look pretty
55:02 - lint will tell you like you know this
55:05 - looks
55:06 - wrong uh you're using the wrong type of
55:08 - pattern here
55:09 - or like it'll like highlight hey you
55:11 - shouldn't use this many characters in
55:12 - one line things like that right sonny
55:15 - yeah do you know where the lin came from
55:17 - the name i didn't know this until like
55:18 - literally about a week ago you know
55:20 - those linters that you put on your
55:21 - clothing
55:23 - oh i didn't know that yeah so it's
55:25 - like picking up the
55:26 - the the fluff of your code that's why
55:28 - it's called yes lint
55:29 - do you know where it's debugging do you
55:30 - know where debugging came from
55:32 - yeah they found a fly right in the
55:34 - massive in one of the first computers
55:36 - or something yeah they would get flies
55:38 - or cockroaches and things like that in
55:40 - the
55:40 - physical computer so they would debug by
55:43 - taking them out
55:44 - they would take out the bugs from the
55:45 - computer i love that
55:48 - i don't know i think frankie or somebody
55:50 - told me that
55:51 - yeah vs code live share important
55:54 - extension
55:55 - pair programming this is how sunny and i
55:57 - usually program
56:02 - exactly the blonde one is me especially
56:04 - when it comes to react
56:10 - that's so funny all right guys
56:13 - how do you but like with all this said
56:15 - like how do you go ahead and learn like
56:18 - how do you
56:18 - what's our advice to you guys if you're
56:20 - new to this journey like how do you go
56:22 - ahead and learn
56:23 - um so we've got a few things on the
56:24 - slides coming up so we've got
56:26 - uh we've got youtube so we've got
56:28 - youtube and
56:29 - from youtube we're talking about our
56:31 - tutorials completely free guys you can
56:33 - go ahead and check them out
56:34 - we've also got um we also recommend that
56:36 - you go ahead
56:37 - and join a community guys so whether it
56:40 - be facebook whether it be linkedin
56:41 - whether you're recording your journey on
56:43 - instagram
56:44 - or whether it be discord or even slack
56:46 - so like uh we actually have our internal
56:48 - slack community which we go ahead and
56:50 - recommend
56:50 - definitely something worth checking out
56:53 - what's your thoughts on that
56:54 - yeah i think this community is super
56:55 - important you know this is why in profit
56:57 - with javascript we just developed a
56:59 - curated community of people
57:01 - you know uh profitable javascript is our
57:03 - paid coaching uh
57:04 - paid program for javascript where we
57:06 - teach you these skills
57:07 - but really the community like you kind
57:09 - of come for the course but you stay for
57:11 - the people you know you stay for the
57:12 - community
57:14 - and so we've got over 1300 members and
57:16 - they're just so
57:17 - freaking amazing and dialed in but guys
57:20 - it doesn't matter whether you join our
57:21 - community or somebody else's just make
57:23 - sure you're part of some community
57:25 - i think it's important it helps you keep
57:27 - moving forward
57:28 - and it keeps you accountable and yeah
57:30 - the people matter
57:32 - yeah so join a community and um should
57:35 - we talk about profit with javascript
57:37 - right now or i think we can talk about a
57:38 - little bit later
57:39 - yeah we took my eye after yeah okay so
57:41 - guys something
57:42 - yeah go for it so what is tutorial hell
57:46 - sonny you can talk about this actually
57:48 - yeah so guys what we find is like a lot
57:50 - of people what they do is they tend to
57:52 - sort of follow tutorials that they see
57:53 - whether it be on youtube or
57:55 - like a stack overflow tutorial and then
57:57 - what they'll do is they'll copy it line
57:59 - by line
58:00 - and what you'll end up with is like
58:02 - you'll finish 10 projects for example
58:04 - but you basically like you haven't
58:06 - really learned anything you just have 10
58:07 - cool projects that you can show
58:09 - but if i was to go in and change
58:10 - something or break something you
58:12 - wouldn't be able to tell me like
58:13 - how to fix it or something like that and
58:14 - then we call that tutorial hub because
58:16 - if you feel like
58:17 - you're doing all these tutorials but
58:18 - you're just not learning anything right
58:20 - so
58:20 - my best advice in this case is don't uh
58:23 - whenever you do that
58:24 - either one extend onto what you've built
58:26 - so if you build a youtube clone
58:27 - add some functionality to the youtube
58:29 - clone so that it then goes
58:30 - further than what was taught inside of
58:32 - that uh any any other tips on how to get
58:34 - out of tutorial
58:35 - i think just build real projects you
58:37 - guys like dribble
58:39 - built for like for example if you're
58:40 - front end developer look at what's on
58:42 - dribble build that
58:43 - uh look at what inspires you build it um
58:46 - don't get stuck in tutorial help move on
58:48 - and actually start doing useful stuff
58:50 - with what you learned
58:51 - now when it comes to fundamentals master
58:55 - them
58:55 - okay yeah master them guys and the
58:58 - reason why we added this slide is
58:59 - because
59:00 - it really is a it's a huge step and it's
59:02 - going to be the difference between you
59:04 - moving very fast and you're moving
59:05 - extremely slow like
59:07 - go ahead break down the fundamentals and
59:09 - use things like w3 schools w3 schools is
59:12 - amazing
59:13 - i love this by the way i just wanted to
59:15 - throw this in here epic epic zeus says
59:17 - you guys are like assassin's creed
59:19 - forming a brotherhood of next-gen
59:21 - programmers we work in the dark to serve
59:23 - the light
59:24 - hey love that nice
59:27 - awesome coin by epic that's a cool name
59:30 - as well it exists
59:31 - yeah that is a pretty dope name yeah
59:34 - nice okay so yeah guys mastering the
59:37 - fundamentals and what is one of those
59:39 -  i love this game that is the
59:42 - funniest thing i've ever seen
59:44 - oh my god so
59:47 - one of the fundamentals guys is get
59:50 - and github and you guys have to learn
59:52 - that and for those of you who know about
59:54 - git merge
59:55 - nobody ever wants to see it happen it's
59:57 - not fun yeah
59:58 - but you got to learn it i think it is
60:00 - very very important a lot of people are
60:02 - saying lag but i think we're going to
60:03 - keep going until it just
60:04 - ends yeah i think it's i think it's
60:06 - cleared up now yeah we're good yep
60:08 - so why you need need to know git and
60:11 - github why is this important sonny
60:12 - i don't care about it i don't need to
60:14 - know about it right you know i can just
60:15 - become a developer without it
60:17 - that's what i for dude but every single
60:20 - professional job that you go in
60:21 - any team environment where you've got
60:23 - more than one developer
60:25 - they don't work together by sharing the
60:26 - files right they work together with git
60:28 - right you need to know get if you're
60:30 - going to be a professional web developer
60:31 - whether it be
60:32 - uh freelancing and you're jumping into a
60:34 - team of a team of
60:36 - sort of developers or you're going into
60:37 - a permanent position you need to know
60:39 - gear and you because what happens is
60:40 - they store their code
60:42 - on something called a repository and
60:44 - then basically you need to learn how to
60:45 - push code to that repository
60:47 - pull code from so if another developer's
60:49 - done some work you can pull that in
60:50 - all of those things are covered with git
60:52 - right now the most popular platform that
60:54 - users get is github you've also got git
60:56 - labs and a few others
60:57 - but i really recommend getting familiar
60:59 - with github it's the most popular
61:00 - it's owned by microsoft now and it's
61:02 - here to stay so it's definitely getting
61:04 - more powerful
61:04 - definitely worth investing your time in
61:06 - that yeah and remember guys one thing i
61:08 - think that's confusing git
61:10 - is not github yeah
61:13 - a lot of people get that uh confusion
61:16 - github is like dropbox for code
61:18 - github is like google drive for code
61:22 - that's github is just like a place where
61:23 - you put your code that's it so
61:25 - git hub is not that important to learn
61:27 - like it doesn't matter if you use github
61:29 - or if you use bitbucket that's not that
61:31 - git you must learn git
61:34 - this is version control this is the time
61:36 - machine for your code if you mess
61:38 - something up you can go back in time
61:39 - so exactly pretty good time machine yeah
61:42 - it's like
61:42 - and also guys it can be scary i know
61:44 - when you're trying to learn github with
61:46 - the terminal
61:46 - so if you guys are experiencing that
61:48 - sort of fear or you're like oh i don't
61:49 - want to touch anything because i'm
61:50 - freaking out and i'm going to break
61:52 - something then something i recommend is
61:53 - something called get kraken
61:55 - which is actually a really nice
61:57 - interface for gear
61:58 - and you can pretty much drag and drop
62:00 - your branches and do all your stuff very
62:02 - visually
62:02 - so if you are afraid of it go ahead and
62:04 - check out get cracking really handy uh
62:06 - gui for uh for handling get yeah yeah
62:10 - i think that's important i'm sometimes
62:12 - mentioned that too
62:13 - so awesome so let's go back uh
62:16 - yeah henrik when he watched that part
62:18 - but git is not github he
62:20 - asked earlier like what's the difference
62:22 - between them and then he's like oh
62:23 - that's yup that's for me
62:25 - so guys just to kind of recap you know
62:28 - we touched on a lot of things and we
62:30 - still have a bunch of things to go but
62:31 - we talked about frameworks right
62:33 - and why react is the framework that you
62:35 - should actually pick
62:37 - uh we're going to talk we talked about
62:39 - that html and javascript is what you
62:41 - need to know
62:42 - to become a developer you know front-end
62:43 - developer and we've touched on
62:46 - other things like you know which code
62:49 - editor you should use
62:50 - but we still have some other things
62:51 - we're gonna touch on moving forward okay
62:53 - so just stay
62:54 - buckled in we're gonna keep going and if
62:56 - you're here and you're enjoying this
62:57 - make sure to like
62:58 - the video so it goes out to other people
63:01 - please it helps us
63:02 - definitely please do that all right
63:06 - cool now what is a pre processor
63:09 - now all right go ahead go for it yeah so
63:12 - a pre-processor guys is pretty much
63:15 - it's it applies to css so we talked
63:17 - about the three fundamentals html css
63:19 - javascript but we're talking about
63:20 - pre-processors
63:21 - all about css right and what it does
63:24 - basically is it's kind of like think of
63:26 - it simply as an
63:27 - upgrade to your css right so with sas
63:30 - they introduced um so on the next side
63:32 - we've got three really
63:33 - uh really popular ones we've got sas
63:35 - post css and less
63:36 - right they're quite opinionated you can
63:38 - use whatever one you prefer
63:40 - sas was quite a popular one that i saw
63:43 - and it basically introduced something
63:44 - called uh
63:45 - like variables into your into your css
63:48 - which was really really powerful guys
63:50 - and it also allowed you to do nesting
63:51 - and a bunch of other stuff so it
63:52 - basically made it more maintainable
63:54 - to go ahead and use um css i think post
63:57 - css and css modules
63:59 - also prevents one of those common
64:01 - problems that we run into where for
64:03 - example in react you you developing
64:05 - components right
64:06 - so if you have two different files and
64:08 - you have the same class name in each of
64:09 - those files
64:10 - you can have like overriding rules
64:12 - without realizing by using these
64:14 - libraries
64:14 - it actually goes ahead and adds an
64:17 - additional class name to it so
64:19 - you never get that issue so even if you
64:21 - had the same class names it wouldn't
64:23 - actually clash
64:23 - so really important things here very
64:25 - subtle but very important if you want to
64:27 - become
64:27 - that next level developer yep
64:31 - awesome all right so let's move to the
64:34 - next one
64:34 - styled components so what are these
64:36 - sunny
64:37 - so this is in react we use start
64:39 - components i really i'm a big fan of
64:41 - style components
64:42 - i think we'll actually go ahead and
64:43 - include this in the next build um
64:45 - basically in react you have something
64:47 - called props and it's very difficult
64:49 - sometimes to have like
64:50 - how do you use your variables so like
64:52 - your javascript variables with css
64:54 - for example if you want to if you've got
64:57 - like a variable which is true or false
64:58 - how do you apply that with your css
65:00 - style components is your answer it
65:02 - allows you to very simply go ahead and
65:04 - do that
65:05 - and you can pretty much basically go
65:07 - ahead and use your props in a component
65:09 - and and and conditionally render your
65:11 - style based on those
65:12 - and those variables so really really
65:14 - powerful stuff
65:15 - uh yeah really really and it's here to
65:18 - stay
65:18 - guys a lot of big companies use it yeah
65:21 - beautiful we just got another super chat
65:23 - by d-punk thank you for that thank you
65:26 - really appreciate it we're
65:27 - over 21 in super chat so thank you guys
65:31 - all right now steve says much less
65:35 - useful now we have css variables
65:37 - natively
65:39 - really good point actually yeah so
65:40 - that's the reason why sas is being less
65:42 - used now i'm also going to talk about
65:44 - sas is being less used
65:47 - oh yeah yeah so like because we have css
65:50 - variables natively now it's actually not
65:52 - as needed as it used to be and it's
65:53 - quite
65:54 - there's quite a few issues with it but
65:55 - we're going to talk about a few things
65:56 - which actually helps you alleviate the
65:58 - the problems that you use you experience
66:00 - with sas so one of them is
66:02 - css modules which we spoke about if you
66:03 - have two files with the same
66:06 - class names this is going to help you
66:07 - avoid that problem and
66:09 - the next one is sas actually allowed you
66:12 - to do something called
66:13 - nesting right but the problem was that
66:15 - people used to nest like
66:17 - five levels deep they would have like um
66:19 - let's just say like
66:20 - card underscore title underscore text
66:23 - underscore
66:24 - like uh link or something like that and
66:25 - it just got super complicated so bem
66:27 - is a really good naming convention which
66:30 - i recommend
66:30 - everyone goes and learns we actually use
66:32 - this in all of our builds
66:34 - really really important stuff i i hated
66:36 - it when i started by the way guys i
66:38 - really didn't see the value in them
66:40 - so i'm somebody who got converted on
66:42 - this and i really do live by it now so
66:44 - something definitely worth learning and
66:46 - because he's a big fan of them now too
66:48 - oh yeah now i know about this
66:52 - now guys with pwa oftentimes we get that
66:55 - question like hey what's a pwa
66:57 - which actually was a question i had in
66:59 - the chat when we were coding
67:00 - and then steve answered but like this is
67:02 - progressive web apps
67:04 - so this is where you're coding in a way
67:06 - where literally like
67:07 - whatever you're building will
67:09 - essentially be turned into a mobile app
67:11 - as well for a phone and it's like
67:13 - native so that's a little bit about how
67:15 - progressive web apps
67:16 - work you want to add anything on this
67:18 - sony um i think on the next side we have
67:20 - a really nice breakdown
67:22 - so basically you're gonna you're coding
67:23 - like a web app but it's very very
67:25 - similar to your native app right so
67:27 - here's a bunch of features of a
67:29 - pwa so you have it's fully responsive
67:31 - and
67:32 - it has a very high browser compatibility
67:34 - right when you use
67:35 - uh create react app with react it is
67:38 - making a pwa just in case you're
67:40 - wondering
67:40 - uh it works offline so you can use
67:42 - something like service workers
67:44 - service workers make the app super fast
67:46 - and allow that offline sort of
67:48 - functionality which you get with a
67:49 - normal app it has like an app like
67:51 - interface so you can actually go ahead
67:52 - and
67:53 - click the more option on like an iphone
67:55 - for example and you can add it to your
67:56 - home screen
67:57 - and it actually gives you a native app
67:59 - fill so it goes onto your home screen
68:01 - and even removes the browser the bar at
68:03 - the top when you open it so it's like
68:04 - super
68:05 - clean you can also get push
68:07 - notifications which is really important
68:08 - but i don't know why and if apple will
68:11 - ever watch this video
68:12 - i don't know can you guys hurry up on
68:13 - that because android
68:15 - allowed push notifications on pwas for a
68:18 - very long time
68:19 - but apple was still on the fence with it
68:21 - so it's been a big discussion and
68:22 - they're really pushing for it
68:24 - but i really do want them to do that but
68:26 - you can get push notifications on a pwa
68:28 - yeah nice and you've already talked
68:31 - about that it's fast with service
68:32 - workers so these are the features of pwa
68:36 - awesome now you got a lot of type
68:39 - checkers like typescript and then you
68:41 - got
68:41 - flow there's typescript
68:44 - and oftentimes people are like what is
68:46 - typescript so what is typescript sunny
68:48 - so it's a superset of javascript so it
68:51 - basically sits on
68:52 - top so it's not like a different
68:53 - language or anything like that
68:55 - it's just like a layer on top of java
68:57 - javascript and basically if you came
68:58 - from a java background or any strongly
69:01 - typed language background
69:03 - then you'll know what types are right so
69:05 - javascript's a weekly type language
69:06 - which
69:07 - means that you don't have to say that a
69:09 - string is going to be a string you have
69:10 - to say that a number is going to be a
69:11 - number
69:12 - et cetera your number's going to be an
69:14 - integer but with typescript
69:15 - you now get that functionality and it
69:17 - also gives you a bunch of other things
69:18 - like inheritance
69:20 - and all these other things that you had
69:21 - in those strongly typed languages
69:23 - so it's basically like like the visual
69:24 - here it's like a super jacked up jack
69:28 - javascript nice i love that image
69:32 - alex goes thanks for the comment shout
69:33 - out clever programmer but i've been
69:35 - asking this and just got aired
69:37 - are you planning to make an eight hour
69:39 - long video for learning react.js
69:41 - yes we are it's gonna be probably 12
69:43 - hours long
69:44 - yeah and it's gonna have like a lot of
69:47 - amazing
69:48 - content in it so let's move forward with
69:50 - this this
69:51 - is typescript versus flow yeah
69:54 - so guys literally this is a big
69:56 - opinionated debate and i've actually got
69:58 - into
69:58 - huge debates in actual professional
70:00 - companies where we talk about
70:02 - are we going to use typescript are we
70:03 - going to use flow my opinion on this
70:05 - matter is
70:06 - use typescript because it's much more
70:09 - sort of picked up now it's much more in
70:11 - use it's much more robust and the power
70:13 - and it's actually supported by microsoft
70:16 - um i i believe so it's actually
70:18 - they're working as well but it's more of
70:20 - an official uh
70:22 - superset of javascript as opposed to i
70:23 - think that it has a new name now which i
70:26 - think you probably haven't heard about
70:28 - oh yeah yeah it's actually called
70:32 - hype script
70:38 - this is where we need the bell you know
70:42 - hey
70:46 - [Music]
70:49 - so yeah guys you know look into it all
70:52 - right
70:53 - we got dino so what's the hype all about
70:56 - all right so dino we always see comments
70:58 - flying in about dino and yes guys if
71:00 - you're interested in about you know we
71:01 - can go ahead and make a video about it
71:03 - it's basically a runtime environment so
71:05 - just like you have node.js right which
71:07 - runs on the servers
71:08 - dino also runs on servers and it's
71:10 - pretty much a case of it's like a
71:12 - it's like a more modern version of
71:14 - node.js so out of the box
71:17 - um it supports typescript whereas
71:19 - node.js you have to install a bunch of
71:21 - things to get typescript so that's an
71:22 - example of the difference
71:24 - it also comes with a bunch of uh it's
71:26 - built in rust i believe so it's very
71:28 - optimal it's very fast
71:29 - uh i think it may pick up but it's very
71:32 - it's very early
71:32 - in in that journey so definitely
71:34 - something which i mean is it's one of
71:36 - those cool things if you're interested
71:37 - in this and you're you're what
71:38 - you're enjoying the video sure go check
71:40 - out dino we can make a video on that
71:42 - awesome all right so now let's get into
71:46 - there's stuff going on here with webpack
71:48 - so webpack is pretty important to learn
71:50 - why is this important
71:51 - why should we care so yeah so when
71:53 - you're learning uh like
71:55 - especially when you're trying to build
71:56 - progressive web apps i recommend you
71:58 - kind of
71:59 - start with create react apps you don't
72:00 - have to jump in with and
72:02 - learn web packs because they basically
72:04 - get rid of that headache for you
72:05 - but when you go into a professional
72:07 - environment and you're doing any sort of
72:08 - javascript
72:09 - i can be sure like you can be sure that
72:11 - they're going to actually be handling
72:12 - the build
72:13 - process with webpack by itself or
72:15 - something like rollup.js which is a
72:18 - different one
72:18 - but basically what this does guys is it
72:20 - bundles your app so all the files all
72:22 - the css all of those things into one
72:24 - bundle which is then served
72:26 - and that's what the user sees as and
72:28 - then go right so definitely something
72:30 - which is quite important
72:31 - and you should go ahead and learn yep
72:33 - definitely dev tools guys master
72:36 - chrome dev tools you can do so much with
72:38 - this thing
72:39 - this is probably one of the most
72:40 - important things i mean i don't even
72:41 - know how you can develop apps or develop
72:43 - web stuff without doing this because
72:45 - that's the number one
72:47 - ask for learning but this is pretty much
72:49 - that thing you do when you go on chrome
72:50 - and you right click and inspect
72:52 - right the thing that pops up that allows
72:53 - you to do everything so like if i was
72:55 - just to demo it for anybody that doesn't
72:57 - know about this
72:58 - like literally if you go on youtube
73:00 - right now you should know how to use
73:02 - things like
73:03 - death tools at a very basic level at
73:06 - least
73:06 - and then you can master but you should
73:08 - master them so
73:10 - you know for people who have never like
73:13 - looked into it let's wait for this to
73:16 - pop up
73:20 - there oh damn our freaking video is the
73:22 - first recommendation let's go
73:26 - nice so nice so now guys over here
73:30 - we got logan paul he's thinking about
73:32 - youtube we have grant cardone
73:35 - talking about how to close over the
73:36 - phone but i can actually hit inspect
73:39 - yeah and then i can even choose this
73:42 - and i can go ahead and literally change
73:46 - the name of this thing over here or find
73:49 - out
73:49 - how youtube is using you know how is
73:52 - youtube
73:53 - formatting this how are they using html
73:55 - and css
73:57 - and i can then use that to reverse
73:58 - engineer this into kind of my own app
74:00 - and you guys can go ahead and change
74:02 - like some of the copy that's on here so
74:09 - this is something uh i this is something
74:11 - i actually do pretty regularly because
74:13 - i want to put my video here and check
74:15 - what it actually looks like
74:16 - so we can actually say you know we're
74:19 - going to be
74:19 - dropping our twitter clone project
74:22 - tomorrow
74:24 - with the react js
74:27 - and you can see boom it just popped that
74:29 - in so this is just a basic basic example
74:32 - of this
74:32 - i'm sure most of you probably know how
74:34 - to use it more than this
74:36 - and it's one gonna be one of your most
74:39 - important tools to use so
74:40 - dev tools and chrome 100 learn that yeah
74:44 - and also guys we like if you're
74:45 - debugging console logging everything out
74:47 - is a really good way of debugging so
74:49 - you definitely need to use uh dev tools
74:51 - when you're console logging
74:53 - yep 100 so let's go to next one what is
74:56 - this
74:57 - this is the react profiler so when
74:59 - you're coding with react
75:01 - it's all about once you get to a certain
75:03 - level it's about making your react app
75:04 - optimal
75:05 - so that you know that it's only
75:06 - re-rendering what it needs to re-render
75:08 - the react profiler is just you access it
75:11 - in the same way that kazi showed you how
75:13 - you access the inspector
75:14 - but you need to install that i believe
75:16 - on the the chrome extensions
75:18 - but basically guys that's basically it's
75:20 - a very very good way of checking what's
75:22 - rendering inside your react
75:24 - app and how many times it's re-rendering
75:26 - it also allows you to manipulate the
75:27 - state and the props
75:29 - so you can actually go in their head and
75:30 - you go you can go and check out and you
75:32 - can change the state and properly when
75:33 - you're
75:34 - sort of building out an app it can
75:35 - really help you out and assets just
75:37 - wrote a good comment
75:38 - he says stick with node for now dino's
75:40 - community is not that big
75:41 - big as it is very new and that's a very
75:43 - good point you guys
75:44 - for now before you jump on the hype
75:46 - train of dino
75:48 - stick with node kind of learn dino for
75:51 - like hobby projects you know do stuff on
75:53 - the side so you're just aware of it
75:54 - but npm isn't gonna go anywhere it's
75:57 - gonna be there for
75:58 - pretty much for a really long time and
76:00 - if dino really starts to take off
76:02 - then siri more seriously start looking
76:04 - into it but
76:06 - you know i do say that the hype train
76:08 - matters if you catch trends that helps
76:10 - put you ahead of people so
76:12 - you know i think it's not a bad idea
76:15 - just even as a hobby play around with it
76:17 - and kind of get to know it
76:18 - yeah definitely and guys it's just going
76:20 - to make you a better front-end developer
76:22 - when you when you mess around with these
76:23 - tools and then you sort of get more and
76:24 - more used to all of these things
76:26 - um so nothing no harm with going ahead
76:28 - and learning it 100
76:30 - now native apps and react native what is
76:35 - this
76:36 - yeah so guys if you code in react just
76:38 - know that you're going to get the
76:40 - benefit
76:41 - of actually then transferring pretty
76:43 - much like 90 percent of that knowledge
76:45 - to something called react native and the
76:47 - react native allows you to build native
76:49 - ios and android apps so really really
76:53 - powerful
76:53 - to to be able to do that and i've
76:55 - actually first hand done this
76:56 - and you can get full full native apps
76:59 - with the same react code base pretty
77:01 - much
77:01 - so really really powerful beautiful
77:04 - and electron allows you to make desktop
77:07 - apps so this is
77:08 - uh electron js right that's the library
77:11 - yeah i think slack is actually built
77:13 - with electrons i think
77:14 - slack is built with electron and
77:16 - yesterday i discovered something else
77:18 - pretty huge was built with electron
77:20 - somebody messaged me on instagram saying
77:22 - some
77:23 - garbage uh zacky actually he usually
77:26 - says really great things but he sent a
77:28 - message saying something funny
77:30 - and then i responded to him let me see
77:32 - if i can actually pull up his message
77:33 - because that was pretty
77:37 - um insightful i mean you can talk about
77:39 - this for a second while i look for it
77:41 - yeah so guys really really uh useful
77:43 - stuff here like
77:44 - the fact is like if you know what slack
77:47 - is you know how popular and you know how
77:48 - much that's taken off
77:50 - it just shows you that yes you can also
77:52 - make you can make money from
77:53 - like mobile apps and web apps but guys
77:55 - remember their desktop apps started the
77:57 - whole thing off right like
77:59 - having like microsoft word having those
78:01 - things actually started at the whole
78:02 - i got it zacky zaki sent me a message on
78:06 - instagram and he said no offense but
78:08 - electron gs is crap
78:10 - with normal windows development you just
78:12 - need to learn c sharp with some xml
78:14 - you know some c c sharp with some xml in
78:17 - your set
78:18 - so that's it pretty easy huh and then he
78:20 - goes personally i'd rather learn that
78:22 - instead of electron but js is
78:26 - definitely powerful with no cap
78:29 - and i responded to him and i said visual
78:33 - studio code
78:34 - is built with electron js and also
78:38 - slack is built with electron js so i'm
78:40 - like i'd ease up on calling that crap
78:43 - yeah the visual studio code is what
78:46 - you're going to be using to code that c
78:48 - sharp that you were talking about yeah
78:50 - yeah yeah yeah
78:53 - yeah so you know just that's what it is
78:56 - like it's a valuable thing
78:57 - learn it i think it's it can be helpful
78:59 - if you want to make desktop apps
79:00 - now let's talk about testing frameworks
79:03 - so
79:03 - testing so let's talk about unit versus
79:06 - integration versus for
79:07 - functional testing so so three different
79:10 - types guys
79:11 - we've got an example here called of just
79:14 - called and basically that's an example
79:15 - of unit unit testing is when we test
79:17 - one specific area of an app right or
79:20 - like a website
79:21 - so it's a very specific thing right
79:23 - integration is when we integrate two
79:25 - different areas of an app and we test it
79:27 - together
79:27 - so like does this screen work with this
79:29 - screen or does this sort of
79:30 - functionality with this one crossing
79:31 - over with this one work together
79:33 - and then functional is like as a user if
79:36 - i do a login and i go through the entire
79:38 - journey
79:38 - is it everything working so you see like
79:40 - there's a big difference between the
79:41 - three
79:42 - just is a very very common um
79:45 - unit testing framework which is used and
79:47 - they usually combine it with something
79:48 - called
79:49 - enzyme so on the next side we have
79:51 - enzyme and here we have uh it's
79:53 - basically
79:54 - very very popular i'm sorry i just want
79:57 - to
79:57 - interrupt you for a second elizabeth
79:59 - who's also
80:00 - you know future code and she said and
80:03 - she
80:04 - was supposed to have a few interviews
80:05 - this week i think she's actually in la
80:07 - right now
80:08 - and she said she was having a few
80:10 - interviews and she said right now i had
80:11 - a major interview
80:13 - for a qa test engineer position
80:16 - while demoing my projects i casually
80:19 - left my deployed netflix app
80:21 - up in the browser and dropped it in they
80:24 - asked me to come back for the next round
80:27 - oh that's nice that's awesome especially
80:31 - if you're doing qa guys they're going to
80:32 - look at that and be like whoa this guy
80:34 - this person can like code this stuff oh
80:35 - wow we just got a five dollar donation
80:37 - oh thank you guys thank you so much
80:40 - and uh at one modus says hey kazi you
80:43 - help me to go from zero coding knowledge
80:45 - to qa automation tester way back in
80:47 - chicago five years ago
80:49 - oh nice oh that is amazing
80:53 - um dude can you drop your name in the
80:57 - chat
80:57 - because i think like i personally worked
80:59 - with you in person five years ago
81:01 - like literally i used to work with him
81:03 - in panera bread
81:04 - on teaching him coding so that would be
81:07 - awesome if you did that
81:08 - yeah i think so nice
81:11 - um before we started clever programmer
81:14 - but what
81:14 - future code was saying earlier was like
81:17 - the netflix clone that we actually built
81:18 - a few days ago and she had that open on
81:20 - the interview so you guys
81:21 - this stuff is powerful this can actually
81:23 - help you land jobs
81:25 - and then she went ahead and future code
81:27 - said i know my updated portfolio
81:29 - thanks to clever programmers getting
81:31 - recognized by companies for sure thanks
81:33 - guys
81:34 - awesome love that yep that makes us
81:37 - super super happy
81:39 - all right so we got just out of the way
81:42 - now what's up with
81:43 - what is this so enzyme so just as a unit
81:46 - testing framework that is
81:48 - most uh most of the time in react we
81:49 - combine it with enzymes so enzymes are
81:51 - testing utility for react
81:53 - and it basically allows you to test the
81:55 - user interface very easily so like if i
81:57 - click this button
81:58 - is the expected uh change on the page
82:01 - gonna happen or not
82:02 - right and it allows you to test all of
82:04 - that extremely fast
82:05 - and what people tend to do is something
82:07 - called test driven development where
82:08 - they'll write these tests using enzyme
82:10 - ingest first
82:11 - and then they would basically build the
82:13 - functionality until the test passes
82:16 - so something to definitely take he
82:19 - dropped it in and he said yes it's
82:20 - modesto from panera
82:22 - yep
82:26 - man that is awesome thank you so much
82:28 - for the donation i really appreciate it
82:30 - and that is
82:31 - amazing that was before any clever
82:33 - programmer any of that
82:35 - that was a great time so i appreciate
82:37 - you
82:38 - for sticking around and even now like
82:40 - helping out
82:42 - that's insane dude that's amazing nice
82:47 - go ahead yeah so we talked about enzyme
82:50 - enzymes a really popular one
82:52 - but what the problem was is that when
82:53 - sort of reactor really quickly evolved
82:55 - so we started seeing hooks and those
82:57 - sort of things
82:57 - uh enzyme quickly kind of got pushed to
82:59 - the side and react testing library is
83:01 - now part of create react
83:02 - app by default so this is a testing
83:04 - library and it supports hooks it
83:06 - supports all of the latest features
83:08 - um and when you use create react app you
83:10 - notice me and kazi usually delete these
83:12 - files
83:13 - um but if we're gonna eventually we will
83:14 - teach you
83:16 - we'll teach you guys how to go ahead and
83:18 - we personally don't like to test
83:20 - a lot yeah we test for like
83:23 - testing ourselves in a professional
83:24 - environment i guess yeah we could go
83:26 - ahead and teach some testing at some
83:27 - point like in a professional environment
83:30 - you would have
83:31 - modesto and he would be helping out with
83:34 - testing you would actually have somebody
83:36 - who has a job as a qa
83:38 - engineer who's doing the testing and so
83:41 - that way you
83:42 - yeah but i mean i think it's still
83:44 - important to learn test driven
83:46 - development
83:46 - i used to do it actually but i think
83:48 - it's just i'm lazy and i avoid it
83:50 - yeah and honestly guys my take on that
83:52 - is if you know how to do
83:54 - testing well for example if you get an
83:57 - interview and they ask you to build
83:58 - something if you write some unit tests
84:00 - in that interview watch them go a bit
84:02 - crazy like that's my honest advice to
84:04 - you guys
84:04 - just write a couple of tests and they
84:06 - will they will look at you and they'll
84:07 - put you above
84:08 - everyone else you submitted just by
84:10 - writing a few unit tests so just a
84:11 - little top tip there
84:12 - that's important that's actually really
84:15 - important
84:16 - uh to know that so you guys get your
84:18 - testing right and then you can actually
84:20 - um
84:21 - you know i think everybody should be
84:23 - getting tested right now
84:24 - uh anyway but you know get your
84:28 - get this right and you'll probably get a
84:30 - job too
84:33 - so the next one guys is functional
84:35 - testing we spoke about unit we spoke
84:36 - about integration but functional is when
84:39 - like it's basically mimicking what a
84:41 - user would do inside your app so
84:43 - an amazing one that i really recommend
84:45 - you guys go ahead and play with is
84:46 - something called cyprus to io
84:48 - and basically like if you want to log in
84:50 - the entire login journey
84:52 - see if everything's working you can
84:53 - pretty much record the journey and
84:55 - literally do it as you would do it
84:56 - and then it will programmatically write
84:58 - the code for you which is amazing
85:00 - uh and then you just click run and it'll
85:02 - basically run through your entire app
85:04 - super fast
85:04 - and you can do this in a really like a
85:06 - productive way and you can have this
85:08 - running in the background
85:09 - when every time you push your code
85:11 - something definitely worth looking into
85:12 - you now you guys might have heard of
85:13 - something called selenium
85:15 - selenium is uh modesto got a job
85:19 - doing selenium oh nice nice
85:22 - but yeah so like selenium was the most
85:24 - popular automation testing um
85:26 - framework for a very long time but it
85:29 - was quite clunky and then the guys
85:31 - over at site who who made cyprus style
85:33 - saw that it was clunky and soils
85:35 - outdated so they went ahead and built
85:37 - cyprus and cyprus
85:38 - i think it's only for chrome but it
85:39 - works so fast compared to selenium so
85:42 - guys like i really would recommend you
85:44 - just play with cyprus if you haven't
85:45 - ever tried that before and it's really
85:46 - easy
85:48 - yeah so yeah trice i burst you guys
85:51 - and um just want to say that we broke 18
85:54 - 000
85:54 - views so far nice uh so thank you guys
85:57 - so much for that we're only an hour and
85:59 - 25 minutes into it
86:00 - we're uh yeah we still got a lot more
86:04 - value bombs
86:05 - coming for you guys but just to recap
86:07 - you guys we've talked about a lot of
86:09 - things
86:10 - we've talked about sas we've talked
86:12 - about react being the framework that you
86:14 - should choose
86:15 - we've talked about learning javascript
86:17 - we've talked about learning firebase and
86:20 - how
86:20 - that will be your front-end your
86:23 - back-end
86:24 - your hosting cloud messaging like all of
86:27 - those things
86:28 - all-in-one database we have talked about
86:31 - even now we're talking about uh we
86:34 - talked about coding editors which coding
86:36 - editors best so visual studio code was
86:38 - our recommendation
86:39 - and right now we're talking about you
86:40 - know what testing frameworks you should
86:42 - use
86:43 - and between cypress and selenium and all
86:46 - these ones
86:46 - we recommend use cypress so there's a
86:48 - lot that we've covered but there's still
86:50 - a lot more that we're going to be
86:51 - covering so keep taking notes have a
86:53 - legal pad next to you
86:54 - because this is one of those videos that
86:55 - can really if you watch it and you
86:57 - follow
86:58 - everything that's laid out in here you
87:00 - can very realistically have
87:01 - a job plan three six-month 12-month plan
87:05 - like a solid plan that can actually land
87:07 - you a job
87:08 - exactly we also covered just to add on
87:11 - to that list we actually covered the
87:12 - five
87:13 - key concepts for uh as a visual like a
87:16 - visual design
87:18 - yeah so really important stuff and guys
87:20 - oh one thing i want to say is i don't
87:22 - know i think yesterday might have been
87:24 - the biggest day of our subscribers i
87:26 - kind of just want to check real quick
87:28 - but we're hitting a lot of craziest
87:31 - number of subscribers thanks to you guys
87:33 - because you guys are coming in for the
87:35 - live streams and
87:36 - oh my god like look at this this is
87:37 - actually the biggest day we have
87:39 - ever had what so look at
87:44 - yeah so look at this this is our
87:45 - subscribers column and if you guys take
87:47 - a look at this
87:48 - you guys are helping us fly and we were
87:50 - hitting 1000
87:51 - and then after you guys started jumping
87:53 - in two thousand three thousand four
87:55 - thousand yesterday was the biggest day
87:57 - we had in a
87:58 - really long time and that was 5 000 so

89:07 - that tomorrow will be a lot of fun
89:09 - and it'll be your chance if you haven't
89:10 - already to do your first build or add to
89:13 - your portfolio if you've been following
89:14 - us
89:15 - yep so what's up with the server side
89:17 - rendering
89:18 - yeah so this is a hot topic uh when it
89:20 - comes to sort of front-end development
89:22 - so
89:23 - server side rendering if you guys don't
89:24 - know what it is it's when
89:26 - most of the time when we sort of build a
89:28 - react app or any sort of app
89:30 - it's usually sort of we go on a web page
89:32 - we request the web
89:33 - page and then they basically send us all
89:35 - the files everything sort of loads the
89:36 - javascript loads on our browser right
89:39 - now that works pretty quick for the most
89:41 - part but what if you want the website to
89:42 - be
89:43 - super fast like if you wanted to
89:44 - basically as soon as you go on that
89:45 - website
89:46 - snap the things loaded so what happens
89:48 - is with server side rendering
89:49 - basically when you make that request
89:51 - when i go into for example google.com or
89:53 - something like that
89:54 - what's going to happen is we send that
89:56 - request google servers does all of the
89:58 - heavy lifting so it basically gets the
90:00 - entire web page
90:01 - bundled together right so it does the
90:03 - entire it bundles the entire webpage
90:05 - together
90:05 - and then it just serves the entire thing
90:07 - at once right so it basically does all
90:10 - the javascript calculations all that
90:11 - sort of
90:12 - uh that stuff which usually does take
90:14 - time on the page and what does this mean
90:16 - it means that the time to interaction is
90:19 - less so that's a crucial thing when
90:21 - you're a front-end developer
90:22 - how quick is the time to interact what i
90:25 - mean by that is when
90:26 - when you click on like say for example
90:28 - you go on facebook.com how quickly is it
90:30 - before you can start playing around with
90:31 - the page
90:33 - right yeah that's a crucial guys as a
90:35 - front-end developer you want that time
90:36 - to interact to be as low as possible
90:38 - server-side rendering is the answer to
90:40 - get that down
90:41 - damn awesome i think we
90:44 - complemented your words very nicely with
90:46 - the written
90:48 - yeah that's really nice awesome awesome
90:50 - so let's go here so what's this
90:52 - next.js so yeah next.js is one of the
90:55 - most popular uh server side rendering
90:57 - frameworks uh and it's very hot right
90:59 - now
90:59 - so if you're looking in this space i
91:01 - would recommend uh
91:02 - maybe look at preact preact is a very
91:05 - lightweight version of doing server side
91:06 - rendering
91:07 - but next.js is the one to use if you're
91:10 - gonna go ahead and do it in
91:12 - uh in a professional environment and i
91:13 - did actually use this so
91:15 - in america you have walmart in in
91:17 - england you have something called tesco
91:19 - tesco is like the size of walmart pretty
91:21 - much uh and it's
91:22 - they use next.js in that uh to render
91:25 - their web pages so
91:26 - it's massive um and basically it's it's
91:29 - extremely powerful it also offers a
91:31 - bunch of like
91:32 - power-ups to react out of the box so
91:34 - really really something to definitely go
91:36 - ahead and play with
91:37 - it's a different way of thinking um but
91:39 - it is kind of uh
91:40 - once you learn it it's gonna pay off the
91:42 - value will pay off it'll be very
91:43 - valuable to an employer
91:45 - yeah so it's definitely something which
91:47 - i recommend you guys go ahead and look
91:49 - at
91:49 - um it's also going to take you this will
91:51 - definitely take you guys
91:53 - from a mid-level front-end developer to
91:55 - a senior like that you need this to be
91:57 - to be considered like a senior level
91:59 - developer
92:00 - when we're talking about a seniority
92:02 - inside of a company
92:03 - dang that is powerful by the way guys
92:07 - are these captions that we're providing
92:09 - for what sonny's saying or what i am
92:11 - saying
92:12 - are these actually helpful and valuable
92:14 - to you but i mean to me sunny this is
92:16 - actually super helpful
92:17 - because it's almost like we're making a
92:19 - slide on the fly
92:20 - yeah honestly i found it i find it
92:22 - really really helpful even me reading
92:24 - over it it clears everything up so
92:26 - yeah definitely let us know in the
92:27 - comments guys if you guys find that
92:28 - valuable and if you do
92:29 - just simply hit the thumbs up button as
92:31 - well
92:31 - [Laughter]
92:34 - nice that was a clean
92:37 - just smooth one was my favorite because
92:40 - it didn't even make sense
92:41 - but i like it i like it
92:46 - yeah i love it okay so build time what
92:48 - am i looking at here
92:50 - right so this is actually moving on to
92:52 - the next thing which is called
92:54 - uh where if i think if you hit next it
92:55 - will jump up it was basically we were
92:57 - talking about statistics
92:58 - right i'm kidding generators so the text
93:01 - i think comes on the on the click yeah
93:03 - yeah so now we're talking about stack
93:05 - site generated so kazi what is a static
93:06 - site generator so
93:08 - you have you ever used one yeah you know
93:10 - me i'm just using jekyll
93:12 - like before i even knew what coding was
93:14 - i was freaking using
93:16 - jekyll like crazy i don't know anybody
93:18 - use jekyll here
93:19 - drop it in the comments below i think
93:22 - it's awesome we're in a blog post today
93:23 - and i
93:24 - started laughing because hugo
93:27 - right yeah yeah hugo yeah so i know like
93:30 - most of the people yeah i see ali and
93:32 - hendrick they're saying actually it's
93:34 - very helpful
93:35 - logan says very valuable 181 modis
93:37 - modesto says yes
93:40 - awesome so yeah this stuff are you
93:42 - laughing at what just sonny just said
93:44 - yeah frankie is laughing too so
93:47 - this is this is uh this makes your site
93:51 - really really fast the static site
93:53 - generators i think are kind of useful to
93:54 - know
93:55 - static site generators also uh github
93:58 - pages
93:58 - generate static sites right and but
94:01 - there are things like jekyll that you
94:03 - want to know where they can take your
94:04 - dynamic content and turn it into static
94:06 - sites
94:10 - i just find it so funny because when you
94:12 - said jekyll i had no idea what it meant
94:15 - yeah yeah you were so confused you're
94:18 - like what is this
94:21 - yeah guys basically what jekyll's going
94:22 - to do it's going to take all your
94:23 - content it's going to make it into one
94:25 - stack like bundle
94:26 - and then it's just going to serve that
94:27 - bundle whenever anyone requests or goes
94:30 - on to your page
94:30 - which is a lot faster than it sounds
94:33 - like uh typically when you go into a
94:34 - website that javascript that you've
94:36 - coded
94:37 - actually has to load dynamically on the
94:39 - browser but when you've got a static
94:40 - site generator
94:41 - you basically make that bundle once and
94:42 - it just serves it every time so
94:44 - really really handy to actually go ahead
94:46 - and build something and if you're
94:47 - looking for speed
94:48 - stacks site generators are your answer
94:50 - the most popular one
94:52 - is gatsby
94:56 - really really popular right now if
94:57 - you've got any kind of sales page
94:59 - e-commerce site or anything gatsby's a
95:01 - really really powerful thing or landing
95:02 - page or portfolio
95:04 - if you go ahead and build a portfolio
95:05 - and say this is written in gatsby
95:07 - uh it's going to be quite impressive to
95:09 - like show to an employer so
95:11 - i'd recommend that you do that if you
95:12 - have got a portfolio um
95:14 - really really awesome thing to go ahead
95:16 - and guys these are all things that you
95:18 - can just like
95:19 - add to your skill set like if you can
95:21 - say i know react that's great that's
95:22 - really good
95:23 - but if you can then go ahead and say i
95:24 - can do server side rendering my
95:26 - portfolio like i know a portfolio is
95:28 - very simple but if you can say this
95:29 - portfolio
95:30 - is server side rendered or like this
95:32 - portfolio is built on
95:34 - react or on gatsby it kind of just adds
95:36 - that sort of like oh
95:37 - like if i was an employer i would get
95:39 - butterflies in my tummy if you told me
95:41 - your
95:42 - freaking portfolio's on using next js
95:44 - i'd be like
95:46 - holy crap because because the employee
95:49 - is going to know
95:50 - though interview he just did that
95:53 - right crazy okay awesome so what's
95:57 - going on here so we got
95:59 - all the are these these are all the
96:00 - static site frameworks right
96:03 - yeah these are a lot of points and
96:04 - next.js is also a static site
96:06 - hey made it up here nice what's
96:10 - next bro i always hear about this it
96:12 - just sounds so dumb
96:14 - yeah i don't know i've actually i've
96:16 - heard about it but i've never looked
96:17 - into it all i know is gatsby in there i
96:19 - think they're only getting
96:20 - i think they're just getting clout from
96:23 - nextjs
96:23 - traffic that misspells it they down yeah
96:27 - next next by mistake uh
96:30 - next djs is the real one and then
96:33 - next is uh something else yeah this is
96:37 - proper stupid name
96:39 - so what's the difference between gatsby
96:41 - and next.js sonny
96:43 - so gatsby is just a static site
96:46 - generator guys
96:47 - nexjs handles server-side rendering and
96:50 - also gives you the static site generator
96:52 - um advantages so
96:54 - if you're looking at um sort of debating
96:57 - between the two
96:58 - i would recommend nextgs is going to
97:00 - provide you more value so i would go
97:02 - ahead and
97:02 - jump into that so your research app your
97:05 - react dynamic app you'll probably use
97:07 - next.js but maybe if you're hosting a
97:09 - portfolio or something static like that
97:12 - use gatsby
97:13 - yes because gatsby yeah a very good
97:15 - point now yeah gatsby's going to be
97:16 - quite easier to implement over in xjs
97:19 - so i'd recommend going ahead and using
97:21 - gatsby if you've got like a simple
97:23 - landing page or something fast
97:24 - you need up and running and you need it
97:26 - easy to maintain gatsby
97:28 - if you're looking for a long term
97:29 - benefit or you're looking for something
97:31 - to get something out there or you're
97:32 - trying to build your portfolio for a
97:34 - professional environment next yes
97:40 - yep so definitely something worth
97:42 - investing your time in
97:44 - awesome let's go to next
97:47 - uh oh somebody said
97:50 - next is typically next.js but for vue.js
97:55 - oh nice yeah and thank you
97:58 - the greatest ever says gonna be watching
98:00 - this tomorrow because i'm finishing up
98:01 - the spotify
98:02 - clone but wanna thank you guys deeply

98:13 - this slide was put together by sunny and
98:17 - also uh alex right now
98:20 - frankie yeah and amanoth
98:24 - from the clever programmer team i came
98:27 - in
98:27 - and help there are a bunch of slides
98:29 - that are coming in from like the
98:30 - previous slides
98:31 - that uh we had all made together frankie

98:50 - and also just taking the time to
98:52 - appreciate that
98:53 - thank you now thank you guys if you guys
98:57 - are still not sure how to get started
98:59 - or you guys want to figure out how to
99:00 - make money as a developer let me know
99:02 - are you guys interested
99:03 - in learning how to make money as a
99:05 - developer
99:06 - this part we wanted to add in for you
99:08 - guys to show you
99:09 - how you can actually start going out and
99:12 - making money
99:12 - as a front-end developer or whatever
99:16 - type of developer you want to become
99:18 - today so this will be the part with
99:20 - freelancing tips with tips of getting
99:22 - your jobs
99:23 - if you're interested let me know and
99:26 - let's go
99:27 - let's do it so the first avenue guys
99:31 - is what kazi the first avenue is
99:34 - becoming i love this becoming a teacher
99:38 - so you can actually with whatever skills
99:42 - you have learned
99:43 - you can actually teach that to other
99:45 - people and
99:46 - you can make an income from doing that
99:50 - like for example okay this is the
99:51 - craziest example but you guys see we're
99:53 - just teaching
99:54 - you guys we're teachers right sunny and
99:56 - i are teachers
99:58 - sunny and i are not just like going
100:01 - crazy working at a job right now we're
100:02 - actually taking the time out to actually
100:04 - teach you guys
100:06 - and we're even getting donations and
100:08 - we're getting paid to teach
100:10 - literally and so what it looks like at a
100:13 - one-on-one basis and
100:14 - is you can actually post your ad on
100:16 - craigslist
100:17 - and you could post your ads on kijiji if
100:20 - you're in canada or you can post your ad
100:22 - on
100:22 - really whatever platform you want and
100:24 - somebody can pay you for you to teach
100:26 - them
100:27 - and you don't have to be so far ahead of
100:29 - them you could just be a little bit
100:30 - ahead of them and charge them
100:32 - for teaching them yeah
100:36 - exactly and guys this is one this is one
100:38 - that i really emphasize
100:39 - in our course a lot with our students
100:41 - because this is the one that you
100:43 - can literally start doing even a week
100:45 - after you start learning how to code
100:47 - like
100:47 - if you're a week ahead of somebody who's
100:49 - never coded before
100:50 - you're now you're now in a position to
100:52 - provide a week's worth of value to
100:54 - somebody who's never coded before so you
100:55 - can actually go ahead and start teaching
100:57 - that
100:57 - right and then only from that day
100:59 - onwards that value only grows
101:01 - right so if you're immediately going to
101:03 - grow your income source and you and
101:05 - the earlier you start the better and it
101:07 - is uncomfortable but like when you just
101:09 - jump in dive into the deep end
101:10 - you're going to go ahead and build that
101:11 - skill and it's always going to be a
101:13 - skill that you can turn to to make some
101:14 - more income
101:15 - yep now this is one way that we'd like
101:18 - to show it to you guys okay so let me go
101:20 - ahead and do that
101:21 - for you guys so let's go ahead here and
101:23 - take a look at this what sunny is saying
101:25 - right so sunny
101:26 - you're saying if i have like literally
101:29 - if you think about levels right let's
101:31 - say you're a complete beginner and
101:32 - you're at level one
101:34 - you just know how to write hello world
101:37 - and then
101:37 - here is level 10 where you use
101:40 - server-side rendering for
101:42 - breakfast
101:44 - so in between all these levels
101:48 - and then let's say you're doing
101:49 - javascript you don't have to you can use
101:51 - any language
101:52 - python or you know go it doesn't matter
101:54 - but let's just use javascript for now
101:57 - and if you are a level one can you teach
102:01 - another level one
102:02 - probably not really right if all you
102:05 - know is hello world
102:07 - you can't really teach much to another
102:09 - person who also knows hello world
102:10 - so if you are over here
102:14 - and actually let's do this right so
102:16 - they're like let's say there's two
102:17 - people
102:18 - here and here yep and um you're
102:22 - like let's say you're on the left hand
102:23 - side and you're teaching this person
102:26 - okay yeah and this
102:29 - is over here i'm just gonna put a little
102:31 - mark and that's gonna say that's you
102:34 - okay now if you're teaching this person
102:36 - you're gonna
102:37 - they're gonna be paying you in return
102:40 - yep and um if you're a level two
102:46 - it's very possible that you can actually
102:47 - be teaching somebody who's a level one
102:50 - yep 100 right because you
102:54 - can you can teach them so like for
102:56 - example what does a level two mean maybe
102:58 - you have put in
102:58 - at level two maybe you've put in like 50
103:00 - hours into coding
103:03 - yeah okay let's say you know how to
103:05 - write functions
103:06 - loops data types you know that stuff
103:09 - yeah you know what array is you know
103:11 - what you know so for example right now
103:13 - you can charge this person you could
103:14 - charge them maybe like
103:15 - ten dollars an hour or fifteen dollars
103:18 - an hour so i'll just put like
103:20 - you know ten dollars at that point you
103:22 - can charge them an
103:23 - hour okay now when you get up to level
103:27 - three
103:29 - and you can teach a level two
103:32 - you're gonna get paid more for that yeah
103:35 - does that make sense so now you might
103:37 - actually make maybe more than ten
103:39 - dollars an hour maybe now you make
103:41 - you now you can make like 18 an hour
103:43 - teaching
103:44 - i just want to stress here guys notice
103:46 - now that your pool of potential students
103:49 - has also grown now you can target level
103:51 - two and level one students
103:53 - yep you can target exactly that's
103:55 - important so you could target both
103:57 - that's huge
103:58 - that's a really good point and then what
104:01 - happens when you're a level
104:02 - four or you're a level five let's say
104:05 - right
104:06 - if you're a level five well what does a
104:08 - level five look like i think a level
104:09 - five is somebody who has
104:11 - put multiple uh you know they've like
104:13 - followed of all of our youtube videos
104:15 - and made all the clones
104:17 - yeah exactly you know they understand
104:19 - like how apis work
104:21 - they understand how uh you know how to
104:25 - put together like
104:26 - their portfolio and they have multiple
104:28 - projects to show for it
104:30 - maybe they don't have real world coding
104:32 - experience where they're getting paid at
104:33 - a job but other than that they're like
104:35 - pretty decent yeah right and that might
104:38 - actually
104:38 - look like what maybe 500 hours of coding
104:41 - or maybe
104:42 - yeah 500 to like 700 hours of coding
104:47 - yeah might actually put you here
104:51 - and now at this level you guys you guys
104:53 - can actually charge a pretty significant
104:55 - amount
104:56 - of income so if you're a level five and
104:58 - you're teaching level fours and stuff
105:00 - like that
105:00 - it's very possible for you guys to make
105:04 - at least in us you know for your own
105:06 - countries you would have to do the rough
105:08 - translation but in us it's very possible
105:12 - for you to charge 35
105:13 - an hour or even 50 an hour
105:17 - and you have experience with teaching
105:19 - people right sunny
105:20 - i definitely do yeah so even literally
105:22 - and guys there's no age limit when you
105:24 - come to teaching i've taught people who
105:25 - are like much older than me
105:27 - and i've also taught a student who was
105:28 - young as 12 years old who landed his own
105:30 - client which is insane like
105:32 - that's so it really does not matter what
105:34 - age or
105:35 - or what experience you're at you can
105:37 - teach yeah yep
105:38 - and so if you are teaching other people
105:41 - you just have to do the math right so at
105:43 - 35
105:44 - an hour you know i use teaching to make
105:47 - well over a hundred thousand dollars a
105:48 - year now of course everybody's gonna be
105:50 - at a different
105:51 - level different like how much effort you
105:53 - put into it how much time you put into
105:55 - it
105:55 - but a few of these clients that are
105:58 - paying you either 35
106:00 - or 50 an hour it the math
106:03 - to getting to 1 000
106:07 - a month like that's the first type of
106:09 - math you should do
106:10 - so let's figure out sunny how
106:14 - long would it take like what it would
106:15 - take for us with at fifty dollars an
106:17 - hour
106:18 - to get to making thousand dollars a
106:21 - month
106:21 - okay so if i'm making 50 generally when
106:26 - you have students they'll do
106:28 - about two hour long sessions how long
106:29 - are your sessions with your students
106:31 - they're one hour 30 minutes yeah
106:34 - typically i start with one hour
106:36 - because it's quite an intense session
106:37 - and then i'll eventually see and if they
106:40 - can handle a two-hour session
106:41 - so let's set two hours yeah i don't push
106:43 - more than two
106:44 - yeah okay because they get fried in that
106:46 - time so let's say you're doing one hour
106:49 - sessions yeah at fifty dollars an hour
106:54 - yeah right uh you're doing one session
106:56 - per week
106:58 - yep okay so one x per week that turns
107:01 - out to be four
107:03 - sessions per month right yep
107:07 - and uh how much is that you guys if you
107:09 - have one
107:10 - student at
107:14 - you know doing four times a month at 50
107:17 - an hour in one month that is
107:22 - two hundred dollars yeah
107:25 - now what happens if now what do we need
107:28 - to do sunny to get
107:29 - up to with the same exact math to get up
107:32 - to one thousand a month
107:35 - we just need to land five students
107:38 - yep guys that's it so or increase or
107:41 - increase the frequency of a student but
107:43 - landing five students is going to get
107:44 - you that yeah
107:45 - yep so you can go both ways it's
107:47 - important what sunny just said
107:48 - so you guys can either in it's really
107:51 - hard to increase the price at 50. i mean
107:53 - it's hard to go with that sooner
107:54 - to 75 or 100 to double the price would
107:56 - be tough
107:58 - but what might be a lot more doable is
108:00 - maybe sunny can start to have
108:01 - two hour lessons with those students and
108:03 - now that student will pay sunny 400
108:06 - a month yeah right exactly or
108:09 - sunny can get a total of five students
108:12 - uh
108:13 - for they each do four x a month sessions
108:17 - at 50 an hour and now
108:21 - that's a thousand dollars a month
108:24 - yeah and guys something i want to stress
108:26 - at this point when you get very good at
108:28 - having a lot more students and you can
108:31 - actually get to a point where you can do
108:32 - group sessions
108:34 - so if you find that you're running out
108:35 - of time where you find that you're
108:36 - getting like kind of intense with the
108:38 - timings
108:38 - you can go ahead and run i wouldn't
108:40 - recommend having large groups because
108:42 - you you lose the one to one
108:44 - but you can definitely go ahead and
108:45 - actually go ahead and split like maybe
108:47 - and have a group of three group of four
108:49 - yeah and you can even give them a
108:51 - discount right so for example if you
108:53 - were charging a 50 maybe you charge them
108:55 - 40
108:55 - per session yeah but now it's a group
108:57 - session so in one hour
108:59 - instead of you making 50 dollars now
109:01 - with three students you make 120
109:04 - in an hour of your time exactly
109:07 - and it's a good deal for all of them
109:10 - yeah it's actually a better deal than
109:11 - them doing one-on-one
109:12 - if they do because they all become a
109:14 - part of the group too
109:15 - and they can all slack each other they
109:17 - can all message each other
109:19 - so that's powerful definitely
109:22 - so i i think that one of the best ways
109:25 - for almost all of you guys including the
109:27 - ones who have a job i think is
109:29 - like guys what would you do if you had
109:31 - extra thousand dollars a month coming in
109:33 - start dropping it in the comments below
109:36 - you know
109:36 - what would the thousand dollars a month
109:38 - allow you to do would it allow you to
109:41 - you know pay your bills wouldn't would
109:43 - you get netflix membership would you get
109:45 - membership to i know gyms are closed but
109:48 - maybe would you get like calisthenics
109:49 - equipment for your home
109:51 - and then do workouts there would you
109:55 - get a course that you've always wanted
109:57 - would you
109:58 - i don't know pay for your parents rent
110:00 - and help out
110:02 - what would a thousand dollars a month
110:04 - allow you to do
110:06 - i think it's important to have those
110:07 - goals because then you will actually
110:09 - want to
110:10 - do more and achieve more other than
110:12 - rather than just like going through life
110:14 - like a zombie
110:16 - yeah and these guys it's really
110:18 - important to determine what your why is
110:20 - like why are you doing
110:22 - this stuff like why are you teaching why
110:23 - are you even here right now
110:25 - trying to learn how to code like
110:26 - remember that because that is going to
110:28 - give you
110:29 - that consistent discipline and
110:31 - motivation to carry on when times get
110:32 - tough
110:33 - yeah so like for example sunny can't sit
110:36 - there through like hundreds or thousands
110:38 - of hours of coding
110:40 - and then like through all the debugging
110:42 - and all the frustration of not making
110:44 - something work where literally he's
110:45 - trying to figure out
110:46 - one goddamn trick with flexbox and it
110:49 - takes them
110:50 - seven hours of like how does this grow
110:54 - shrink thing work or like why you know
110:57 - it's a 0.8 or a 0.9 flex
111:00 - and how does he or somebody like me get
111:05 - through
111:05 - so much coding if our why was weak and
111:09 - we didn't have a good reason we would
111:10 - not get through
111:11 - any of that you know if so it has to be
111:14 - something more important to you than
111:16 - just money
111:18 - exactly a few answers coming in though
111:21 - uh for what people would spend with a
111:23 - thousand so it would allow me to pay my
111:24 - rent
111:25 - uh and also pay my sibling fees and get
111:27 - to meet some of their basic needs
111:28 - awesome
111:30 - mark says i would invest in stuff and
111:32 - develop myself
111:34 - nice and uh ken laps as he uh get a wife
111:38 - [Laughter]
111:40 - nice douglas says i would join profit
111:43 - with javascript
111:44 - awesome hey um
111:47 - so let's go back to what we're talking
111:49 - about here you guys so
111:51 - now this is the math to getting to a
111:54 - thousand a month you guys
111:55 - it's not that freaking hard now to go to
111:59 - 2000 a month what do you need to do and
112:01 - guys here's a better way to look at it
112:03 - this is not a thousand a month
112:07 - this is actually let me write that up
112:09 - top at the top left
112:10 - this is actually five students
112:14 - is 12 000
112:17 - a year yeah that's the right way to look
112:22 - at it
112:22 - it's actually 5 000 or it's actually 12
112:25 - 000 a year
112:27 - yep and if you guys want to get to 24
112:31 - 000 a year or 2 000 a month
112:34 - 10 students
112:37 - and you guys can see the growth here
112:40 - from 5 to 10 students isn't actually a
112:42 - lot but the growth in your income is
112:43 - significant
112:45 - yes very significant so
112:48 - this is something you guys can do guys
112:50 - so easily
112:51 - like their instagram you can go and
112:54 - instagram people on coding channels and
112:56 - start having conversations with them and
112:58 - say i will help you for free
113:00 - for 60 minutes in coding i will jump on
113:03 - a video call with you and help you
113:05 - you can go into a facebook group and ask
113:08 - people if they need help and give them a
113:10 - free session and then at the end of the
113:12 - free session
113:13 - say hey you know i'm glad you enjoyed
113:16 - this
113:16 - if you want me to help you more i'm um
113:19 - you know i charge
113:20 - 25 an hour i charge 10 an hour i charge
113:23 - 35
113:23 - an hour 50 an hour something like that
113:25 - does that make sense you guys
113:27 - you guys can literally do this today you
113:30 - don't need to wait for anything you
113:32 - don't need to wait for anyone
113:34 - so this is possible for you guys now
113:37 - there are online
113:38 - tons of amazing platforms where you guys
113:40 - can go
113:41 - and start teaching so i will give you
113:45 - more ways of making income but this is
113:46 - actually one really big
113:48 - pillar of having your income come
113:51 - in so we'll talk about some of those
113:54 - platforms right now
113:56 - and then we're going to go ahead and
113:58 - continue with the video but there are
113:59 - important platforms that you guys should
114:01 - know and write down so one is
114:02 - takelessons.com
114:03 - and the other one is wiseand.com so
114:06 - these are really good platforms look
114:08 - in the u.s that are great for finding
114:11 - lessons but if you're not in the u.s
114:15 - look at people per hour look at
114:18 - fiverr.com
114:21 - yeah and um also you guys have
114:24 - facebook and instagram which is
114:25 - worldwide right you can go into
114:27 - groups programming groups and help
114:29 - people there
114:30 - and you can get clients from there very
114:33 - easily okay we have some students try
114:35 - this strategy and they literally have
114:37 - clients the next day and of course i
114:40 - think craigslist is worldwide
114:42 - so use craigslist as well and we'll list
114:45 - out all of these resources for you guys
114:47 - at the end
114:49 - and also guys one worth mentioning is
114:50 - instagram so literally if you just go
114:52 - ahead and document your journey as a
114:54 - developer
114:55 - you'll actually be surprised that how
114:56 - many people reach out and ask for help
114:58 - ask for this
114:59 - and you can actually then convert that
115:01 - to a potential student that you start
115:03 - teaching yep
115:04 - exactly so let's i'm gonna go ahead and
115:07 - now guys this
115:08 - works if you're working extremely hard
115:11 - and you can teach people who are
115:13 - you know literally one level behind you
115:15 - you don't have to be so
115:16 - far ahead of them to teach them remember
115:20 - so you can be a level two teaching a
115:22 - level one you can be a level five
115:23 - teaching everybody underneath it
115:25 - so yep let me go ahead and save this
115:29 - and then go here and i'm gonna remove
115:32 - this now
115:34 - cool so let's move forward here now
115:37 - i'm gonna skip through a little bit of
115:38 - this you guys and we're gonna go
115:40 - you know i even have some math here you
115:42 - can take a look at it but if you
115:44 - if you wanna go on the instagram route
115:47 - or facebook route where you kind of want
115:48 - to do hand to hand combat you can dm 100
115:51 - people
115:53 - something interesting like not please
115:56 - sorry mommy
115:57 - can you please i beg you we that's like
116:00 - 99 of the messages i get in my dms
116:03 - um so don't do that that'll be bad
116:05 - nobody will respond to you'll get
116:07 - ignored
116:08 - but if you give them a good message
116:10 - that's like positive
116:11 - hey i see you are crushing it at
116:16 - skateboarding absolutely love that and i
116:18 - see that you're also doing coding
116:20 - pump for you that's it don't ask
116:22 - anything
116:23 - don't want anything don't need anything
116:26 - don't beg
116:27 - don't put more than one question mark
116:29 - ever
116:30 - even in our chat if i ever see more than
116:32 - one question mark ever i'd never respond
116:34 - to that person
116:35 - so yeah um be
116:39 - clean be a clean giving caring human
116:42 - being
116:42 - and if you send those messages uh 20
116:45 - people out of the 100 will respond to
116:47 - you
116:48 - okay five
116:51 - will get on you can get on a call with
116:53 - five of those people if you close one
116:54 - person
116:55 - that's just from one client you're gonna
116:56 - make 320 a month now you can do this
116:59 - strategy whether you want to freelance
117:00 - and actually code for people and build
117:03 - websites or
117:04 - build apps for them and this will work
117:06 - for you even if you want to do it for
117:07 - coaching
117:08 - okay this works for both now one student
117:12 - or
117:12 - one client can be worth up to
117:15 - three to four thousand a year if not
117:17 - more just one
117:19 - all right so that is a pretty important
117:22 - and helpful thing
117:23 - for you guys to know now if you want to
117:25 - go from
117:26 - 3 000 a month and you're like hey how do
117:29 - i actually take that from 3 000
117:31 - um and go you know that 3 000 a month
117:35 - guys is actually 36 000 a year so
117:38 - yeah this is that's always important to
117:40 - kind of remember that
117:42 - and um i'm going to kind of move past
117:44 - some of these and here's the resources
117:46 - you guys can use so you guys can use
117:48 - facebook groups and sonny you want to

118:03 - which you'd be surprised
118:04 - actually works upwork fiverr linkedin is
118:07 - actually surprisingly good guys yes

118:11 - and go on and linkedin is something
118:12 - where it's like a growth thing like you
118:14 - build up that network
118:15 - and you'll be surprised at what like if
118:17 - somebody would just share your name and
118:19 - say i know a guy
118:20 - who can code and before you know it you
118:22 - have a lot of my
118:23 - sort of jobs have actually been through

122:14 - yep
122:15 - um so awesome love you guys so now let's
122:19 - move on to
122:20 - mark says i am already on linkedin and
122:23 - upwork but i still see myself as a
122:24 - beginner but i'm hungry
122:26 - guys don't say no for the other person
122:30 - this is one thing i learned from garyvee
122:31 - which is beautiful
122:33 - apply to the job that you're thinking
122:35 - about you know
122:36 - actually like send out the messages on
122:40 - take lessons wisen or whatever platforms
122:42 - to get
122:42 - clients you know uh if you're a beginner
122:46 - maybe you can still provide some value
122:48 - you know at the very worst case you can
122:50 - give refund or you can give the money
122:51 - back guarantee
122:52 - right but don't say no for the other
122:54 - person go all the way
122:57 - now with that said let's continue
123:00 - on here so boom got tons of things so
123:03 - working from home now you guys can use
123:05 - tons of online platforms if you want to
123:07 - do
123:08 - freelancing the reason why we mentioned
123:10 - teaching is i think it's the easiest
123:11 - thing to get into
123:12 - it's also a thing you can scale up
123:14 - forever like we're teaching you right
123:16 - now
123:17 - exactly so talk to me about this sonny
123:22 - yeah so we spoke about number one which
123:23 - was teaching and that's definitely
123:25 - something you guys can do right now
123:27 - but when you obviously in teaching i
123:28 - just want to add to one thing guys like
123:29 - when you teach
123:31 - it makes you such a better developer
123:33 - like i can't stress that enough every
123:35 - single live stream that we teach every
123:36 - single
123:37 - time i teach a student i become a better
123:39 - developer because you're teaching that
123:41 - principle you're teaching the ability to
123:42 - code
123:43 - so you get actually naturally just
123:45 - become a better developer so
123:46 - you'll naturally grow to a position
123:48 - where you can offer value to clients
123:50 - you can offer value and that's where
123:52 - freelancing comes in as number two
123:53 - so three really good sites here to land
123:56 - freelancing clients we've got upwork
123:58 - freelancer.com and top tool right yeah
124:01 - the one
124:01 - sort of recommend here as being the most
124:03 - successful is upwork because
124:04 - freelancer.com
124:05 - you can get into sort of some battles
124:07 - with sort of a trying to bid for things
124:09 - but
124:10 - again if you build up quite a handsome
124:12 - sort of portfolio on freelancer.com i've
124:13 - seen people do really really well on
124:15 - that
124:16 - and guys a really nice benefit to
124:18 - freelancing is also
124:19 - it's remote so most of you um who are
124:22 - watching from different parts of the
124:23 - world right now
124:24 - you guys can tap into different markets
124:26 - you can tap into the united states you
124:27 - can tap into london
124:29 - you can tap into any market you want
124:30 - provided you just build that skill
124:32 - you build that skill the ability to
124:34 - freelance is is in literature and guys
124:36 - this is one thing i want to stress here
124:37 - you can scale to
124:39 - very very high numbers when you're just
124:40 - freelancing big numbers
124:42 - uh we had uh we have a student in our
124:44 - program profitable shortcut last month
124:46 - he called me
124:47 - he closed he did 28 000 in cash
124:51 - from freelancing he
124:54 - did and then within the first 10 days of
124:57 - um
124:58 - i think yeah within the first 10 days of
125:00 - the next month after that
125:01 - this guy did uh 12 000 already
125:05 - so that's insane crushing it and
125:07 - freelancing and doing
125:08 - scraping web scraping and automation
125:12 - and all kinds of things but he's just
125:14 - hustling and grinding and getting it
125:16 - done
125:16 - there's tons of opportunity out there
125:18 - but people just
125:19 - you know they just don't take advantage
125:21 - of it um
125:25 - awesome so by the way i want to say guys
125:27 - we just broke
125:28 - 20 000 views on this video total
125:31 - over 20 000 times it's been viewed so
125:34 - thank you guys so much for the love and
125:36 - i do want to say a lot of it is because
125:37 - of
125:38 - you watching this and you hitting that
125:40 - like button because it helped
125:42 - it did help send it out to more and more
125:44 - people
125:45 - and if you're watching this and you
125:46 - still haven't done that go ahead and
125:48 - just hit that like button because
125:50 - guys we want to make as many developers
125:53 - on the planet as possible that's our
125:55 - mission
125:57 - exactly and uh that's awesome
126:00 - so now you know boom with that said you
126:03 - know
126:04 - the third step that you guys would want
126:05 - to do is so
126:07 - you know the second thing we talked
126:08 - about is freelancing the third is
126:10 - getting a permanent job that's a lot of
126:12 - what people want to do
126:14 - but people go about it i feel like kind
126:16 - of in a backwards way
126:18 - where the first thing that they're
126:19 - looking for is a permanent job and
126:20 - that's really
126:21 - hard to get you guys when you're just
126:24 - starting out as a developer and that's
126:25 - why
126:26 - most people i know quit most people i
126:29 - know
126:30 - quit within one year almost every single
126:32 - person
126:33 - very few people stay after that one year
126:37 - mark and end up getting a job
126:39 - so i think that's a very discouraging
126:40 - route to go i think it's not the
126:42 - smartest or even the fastest route
126:44 - to go i think the fastest route to grow
126:46 - skill wise
126:47 - is to first teach it's going to grow
126:49 - your own skills
126:50 - the most you're going to be getting paid
126:53 - while you're learning yourself
126:56 - and then i think step two you should try
126:58 - to get so
126:59 - i think with uh you should start
127:01 - teaching
127:02 - in your first three months of coding
127:04 - okay you should start teaching within
127:06 - that time frame
127:07 - then around your sixth or ninth month
127:10 - you should actually start doing
127:11 - freelancing
127:13 - and then after a year or year and a half
127:17 - of experience i think you should go for
127:18 - a full job uh definitely curious to hear
127:21 - your thoughts on this too sonny
127:23 - yeah i would definitely say guys and i
127:25 - just want to kind of rule out a myth
127:26 - here so the way that you typically see
127:28 - this is like as you said it's very
127:30 - backwards right like
127:31 - what i usually see is people will go to
127:33 - university and then they would like
127:35 - study for three four years
127:37 - never had made a single penny when it
127:39 - comes to like their coding abilities
127:41 - and then they would go straight to step
127:42 - three which is a permanent job and you
127:44 - see like it just doesn't make sense like
127:45 - it doesn't make any sense like
127:47 - literally you could watch your youtube
127:49 - videos and you could sit there teach
127:50 - yourself how to code through like
127:52 - youtube videos
127:53 - through us guys through um through w3
127:55 - schools or a bunch of online resources
127:57 - start teaching like through the methods
127:59 - we spoke about before
128:00 - start earning an income and then you
128:02 - build up that skill set from teaching
128:04 - you build up the ability to build up an
128:06 - income
128:06 - and you can grow that income at a rate
128:08 - that's very comfortable for you
128:10 - you then become a better programmer you
128:11 - can learn freelance clients
128:13 - and then all of that experience becomes
128:16 - extremely attractive
128:18 - to a an employer and that's not a secret
128:20 - to it
128:21 - that's a secret to having years of
128:23 - experience
128:24 - before ever having a job exactly
128:28 - you know that like it's almost like a
128:29 - circular thing that everybody always
128:31 - talks about you know it's like you must
128:32 - have two years of experience and it's an
128:34 - entry-level job and you're like
128:35 - [Music]
128:37 - yeah exactly and the truth is guys if
128:40 - you go to an employer and they said five
128:41 - years experience and you only had one
128:43 - year but your one year
128:44 - consisted of you teaching a bunch of
128:46 - students
128:47 - killing it with freelancing jobs i'm
128:49 - telling you they would forget about that
128:51 - five years of experience and they would
128:52 - consider taking you on board yeah like
128:54 - it really does it just comes down to
128:56 - what you can offer them
128:58 - in terms of value so honestly focus on
129:00 - what you can like
129:01 - provide in terms of value and that skill
129:03 - that you can offer
129:04 - as opposed to going the traditional
129:06 - route of like university
129:08 - and then straight to the permanent
129:09 - position it just doesn't work that way
129:10 - in real life cold wakeman says i don't
129:12 - like teaching can i just do step two
129:14 - straight away yeah i mean it's gonna as
129:16 - long as you can develop
129:18 - the skill of coding and keep getting
129:20 - good yeah you can do step two of uh
129:23 - freelancing pretty much right away so
129:24 - here's how i break it down you guys so
129:26 - we call this the modern javascript
129:28 - developer pyramid of wealth
129:30 - and i we feel like this is how you can
129:32 - kind of stack all this on top of each
129:34 - other
129:34 - so one it's learn the coding skills to
129:36 - become a modern javascript developer so
129:38 - that's just coding skills
129:40 - learn that step two is you can start
129:42 - coaching people
129:43 - now this is a you can be a beginner and
129:46 - coach other people
129:47 - and the time to build the stream of
129:49 - income is one to three months
129:51 - all right yep and you can get this
129:54 - stream of income
129:55 - up to three thousand dollars a month if
129:57 - not more this is more on the
129:58 - conservative side
130:00 - and uh next up you can actually
130:03 - work freelance so this is you can work
130:06 - for clients independently and you can
130:07 - get this
130:08 - up to now you can get with just
130:10 - freelancing alone
130:12 - you can realistically be making 5k a
130:14 - month
130:15 - right sunny yeah 100 and guys again like
130:18 - as you said this is conservative so you
130:20 - can actually raise those numbers up
130:22 - divided on how hard you're working and
130:24 - you can build a stream of income within
130:26 - for your first four to 12 months of
130:28 - learning to code
130:29 - okay first four to 12 months just put in
130:32 - a lot of hours into coding okay a lot of
130:34 - people are like hey how did i start
130:36 - uh getting clients in three months of
130:38 - experience
130:39 - i just coded like 15 to 20 hours a day
130:43 - yeah and then guys just to just add on
130:46 - there guys
130:47 - it stacks up so while you have the
130:49 - freelancing you can carry on the
130:50 - coaching so it can stack up yeah
130:52 - yep i love that quan quang says you guys
130:55 - are so good in the community's
130:57 - standard is so high i haven't even seen
130:59 - one negative comment so far
131:02 - amazing i love that yep so this is the
131:04 - power of culture you guys you keep and
131:06 - appreciate the
131:07 - people you love you over nurture and
131:10 - love them
131:11 - and then anybody who's toxic you cut
131:13 - them so you don't have a long
131:14 - conversation with them you don't have a
131:16 - long back and forth
131:17 - you don't try to change their minds you
131:20 - just
131:21 - uh you just not communicate with them
131:24 - and you you they're not part of the
131:26 - culture anymore so that's how you can
131:28 - keep the culture at the highest standard
131:30 - possible at all times this is also true
131:32 - when it comes to your circle of friends
131:34 - you might be outgrowing because you're
131:36 - here i mean you
131:38 - here learning about front-end developer
131:40 - guide i can promise you a lot of your
131:41 - friends are probably not doing this
131:43 - right now
131:44 - a lot of the people around you are not
131:45 - doing this and they're not growth
131:47 - oriented
131:48 - so you also have to start thinking about
131:51 - who are the people that are not
131:53 - anymore a good fit for your circle so
131:56 - you have to actually
131:58 - one part of self growth is to be really
132:00 - loving and over nurturing and be really
132:02 - accepting
132:03 - the second part of self growth is having
132:05 - self-respect and boundaries
132:06 - so those people aren't going to grow
132:08 - with you and aren't going to respect you
132:11 - then you have to move on and get a new
132:14 - set of friends
132:15 - right and then those set of friends they
132:17 - have to go
132:19 - yeah exactly and i i couldn't agree more
132:22 - in terms of like
132:23 - that negativity guys it's it's like a
132:24 - toxic sort of trait and it does spread
132:27 - like
132:28 - it's might start off with a small
132:29 - comment here and there but that will
132:31 - literally
132:31 - can destroy your work ethic if you stay
132:34 - around it long enough
132:35 - whereas if you surround yourself with
132:36 - hard-working people who are literally
132:38 - driven every single day
132:40 - i'm telling you you will literally just
132:42 - you start to mask their behavior you
132:44 - start to master their
132:45 - their sort of traits and then naturally
132:46 - you follow the same footsteps
132:48 - so really really is important to
132:50 - surround yourself with the white people
132:51 - yep super important and the last thing i
132:55 - want to mention is you guys the step
132:56 - four
132:57 - is to go get a job and work as a
132:59 - full-time developer
133:01 - now required skill level for this is
133:02 - advanced
133:04 - okay which is why we think you should
133:06 - try to do this last
133:07 - and then time to build the stream of
133:09 - income is 12 to 24
133:11 - months all right so this is gonna take
133:14 - 12 to 24 months and again it all stacks
133:16 - so you could
133:17 - be coaching and making 3k a month on top
133:20 - of that you could be freelancing and
133:21 - making 5k a month so now you're at 8k a
133:23 - month
133:24 - and then on top of that i mean this is
133:26 - probably going to get really hard or
133:28 - almost impossible you're you can have no
133:29 - time and no freedom to do anything
133:31 - but you could also be doing a job that's
133:34 - paying you like 7k a month
133:36 - so it's possible that you could have a
133:39 - potential of 15k a month or more income
133:42 - okay uh it depends on your hard work
133:45 - depends on what you do i'm just showing
133:47 - you guys this
133:47 - to see what's possible i'm not saying
133:49 - any of you will actually achieve this
133:51 - okay can i just add here guys that
133:53 - literally when i started working with
133:55 - qazi
133:56 - i had a full-time job i was freelancing
133:58 - on the side
133:59 - and i was coaching so oh living yeah
134:02 - like i did all of those things
134:04 - now like kazi said is it something you
134:06 - can really hold on to like with all of
134:08 - them stacked on top of each other
134:10 - it really depends on how you manage your
134:11 - time but then i chose to sort of drop
134:13 - the freelancing and work like
134:15 - full time with kazi and like and and to
134:16 - carry on with coaching so
134:18 - it's really a case of like it's very
134:19 - flexible but you can actually do all
134:22 - three
134:22 - like you can do all three if you need to
134:24 - and you're in a position it's all
134:26 - down to how hard you're willing to work
134:28 - and the effort that you're willing to
134:29 - put in
134:30 - yep it really comes down to you um
134:34 - yep so this is awesome harish says you
134:37 - guys are awesome you guys boost the
134:39 - confidence in
134:40 - all of us all right so there you guys go
134:43 - if you guys want to take a picture of
134:45 - this go ahead and do so now i'll be
134:46 - moving this uh in five four three two
134:50 - one so let's go on to the next one
134:51 - so now guys if you want to be able to
134:54 - take all of these skills that we taught
134:55 - you right being uh if you want to be
134:57 - able to like
134:58 - learn if you want to be able to coach
135:01 - if you want to do freelancing and job
135:04 - and you want to
135:04 - stack these skills and these streams of
135:07 - income in this exact order
135:09 - that's exactly what we teach you how to
135:12 - do in our course profit with javascript
135:15 - all right yeah and in this course you
135:17 - know we have tons of students and they
135:19 - just have
135:19 - really really great experiences and
135:22 - daniel over here says in the future i'll
135:23 - continue to learn more and teach
135:25 - students
135:26 - we have muhammad he says i hope this
135:28 - community will be part of my future
135:29 - projects
135:30 - johnny bridge going i have zero coding
135:32 - experience i'm proud of creating my
135:34 - google maps app
135:35 - kate says thank you so much for this
135:37 - challenge and
135:38 - in the future i want to be a full stack
135:40 - developer and start freelancing so these
135:42 - are all the people that are part of our
135:43 - community
135:45 - and um let me talk just a little bit
135:49 - more is it okay if i talk a little bit
135:50 - more about profit with javascript you
135:52 - guys because of course we've
135:54 - just invested so much time and energy
135:56 - into building it out and making it the
135:58 - best
135:59 - possible resource on the planet for most
136:01 - developers
136:02 - so i would really appreciate it if sonny
136:04 - and i could speak on it for
136:06 - probably like a few minutes yeah
136:09 - definitely yeah so let me go over here
136:13 - and open this up
136:16 - boom while kazi does that guys i think
136:19 - it's worth uh
136:20 - actually telling you guys so i know we
136:21 - showed a few of those customer
136:23 - experiences there but
136:24 - we actually just hit over i think it's
136:26 - over 1500 students in the community
136:29 - right
136:30 - oh yeah yeah yeah so
136:34 - that is absolutely insane and i think i
136:36 - will show that in just a second
136:38 - to everybody so guys in our profit with
136:40 - javascript course
136:42 - uh this is our program profit with
136:44 - javascript
136:46 - and we have the url up here so you can
136:48 - go to it directly or
136:50 - you can click the link in the
136:52 - description below
136:54 - and that will take you to this page
136:56 - right away
136:57 - but this course profit with javascript
136:59 - we cover all of these things we talked
137:01 - about
137:02 - so you learning the skills of becoming a
137:05 - developer
137:07 - you learning how to become a you know
137:10 - so it has the 15 javascript training
137:12 - modules that will give you all the
137:14 - training that you actually need
137:17 - right underneath that if you look you
137:19 - have weekly javascript and react
137:22 - training calls and son you want to speak
137:24 - to the weekly training calls
137:26 - live yeah so guys like this is where we
137:29 - really
137:30 - like differentiate from like a udemy
137:32 - course or anything else that's kind of
137:33 - out there right now because
137:35 - in these coaching calls and in these
137:36 - live training course it's a really a
137:38 - chance for you to be able to actually
137:40 - communicate and run through your
137:41 - problems with us
137:42 - that you're experiencing we run through
137:44 - different
137:45 - very cutting edge projects every single
137:48 - week so
137:49 - literally it's a case of you're not on
137:51 - like a live stream you're on a zoom call
137:53 - so you're literally on a video call with
137:55 - me with nars
137:57 - with jacob with a few people in the
137:58 - community and guys like what i mean it's
138:00 - one to one feedback here like
138:02 - there's people asking questions you can
138:04 - interrupt me at any time we got we
138:06 - literally take things to a whole new
138:07 - level in these coaching calls
138:09 - and our students love it they literally
138:11 - thrive off of it
138:12 - afterwards there's an amazing slack
138:14 - community where they literally send me
138:15 - messages of the sort of homework that we
138:17 - sat
138:17 - that we go through together um we have
138:20 - an amazing
138:21 - pool of success coaches and cars what is
138:23 - a success coach
138:24 - success coaches are going to be people
138:27 - when you join the program you're going
138:28 - to be paired up with a success coach
138:30 - and what they will do is every single
138:33 - project that you actually submit
138:35 - or every homework assignment that you
138:38 - complete or every app that you build
138:40 - they're going to give you personalized
138:42 - video
138:43 - feedback on all of your assignments
138:47 - so imagine getting video feedback by
138:49 - somebody who's a lot more seasoned than
138:50 - you
138:51 - and as a skilled developer or sometimes
138:53 - they're even professionals
138:55 - and they give you feedback on your code
138:57 - they give you feedback on your app
138:58 - design
139:00 - and we get very technical with that so
139:02 - those are
139:03 - success coaches and they make sure that
139:05 - you're getting
139:06 - all of the work done exactly
139:09 - and guys a lot of people actually say
139:11 - when you combine the weekly coaching
139:13 - calls with the personalized video
139:15 - feedback
139:16 - the modules that you get and then on top
139:18 - of that all of the skills that we then
139:19 - go and
139:20 - like we teach you that and then we teach
139:21 - you actually how how to go and take
139:23 - those skills
139:24 - and start making money straight away
139:26 - with that our students are pretty much
139:28 - called this like a 10 it's worth it
139:29 - pretty much the equivalent of a 10k
139:31 - coding boot camp yeah
139:32 - my opinion go ahead in my opinion i
139:35 - honestly i've been to university i've
139:37 - done a master's degree
139:38 - and this is what i would have like if i
139:40 - knew something like this existed i just
139:42 - don't think
139:43 - i actually tell students now don't
139:44 - bother going to university just join
139:46 - like a course or community and change
139:48 - your life through this where you save
139:49 - yourself a lot of money
139:50 - and literally will transform your life
139:52 - and take you to that whole nother
139:54 - level of becoming a developer yeah this
139:56 - seriously will is a game changer you
139:58 - know and so
139:59 - that's why jose shapiro he told me he's
140:03 - like dude this is actually more valuable
140:05 - than my six-month coding bootcamp
140:07 - and he goes i paid ten thousand dollars
140:08 - for that one
140:10 - so yeah amazing you know so a lot of
140:13 - students are getting amazing
140:14 - results like you guys should go and
140:16 - check this out
140:18 - and uh i want to highlight the community
140:20 - real quick for you guys so you guys can
140:22 - see
140:22 - the caliber of people in the community
140:24 - that's actually part of
140:26 - profit with javascript well it actually
140:28 - full screen hold on so i'm gonna open up
140:30 - my app
140:31 - so this is actually a good app that you
140:33 - guys should know about it's called
140:34 - spectacle
140:36 - and it's really good for um
140:40 - man my computer is just freezing
140:44 - yeah i use spectacular it's really handy
140:46 - tool guys when you want to snap things
140:48 - to the left side of the screen right
140:49 - side screen
140:50 - go full screen really really cool um
140:53 - especially when you're sort of trying to
140:54 - be productive
140:55 - yeah yeah super valuable so i'm gonna
140:58 - click this and hopefully my computer
140:59 - doesn't freeze
141:00 - but the guys the community is absolutely
141:02 - insane in this program and we have over
141:05 - 13 we have now 1 400 members just in our
141:09 - slack community
141:10 - and this is not we're not even talking
141:12 - about the 1500
141:14 - uh students that are just part of the
141:15 - course so
141:18 - that community is really what makes most
141:20 - students who come to the program stay
141:22 - they love the training they love all the
141:25 - material that's there they love all the
141:26 - projects
141:27 - but the fact that any question you have
141:30 - can
141:30 - can and will be answered in less than
141:33 - five minutes
141:35 - is massive for people and it will be
141:37 - answered by somebody who deeply cares
141:40 - by somebody who would even be sometimes
141:42 - willing to jump on one-on-one calls with
141:43 - you so the heart
141:45 - that is really important and
141:48 - um the weekly calls you guys will have i
141:50 - mean of course you guys are building
141:52 - real world projects so i think if you
141:54 - are serious about becoming
141:56 - a developer and you want to get a job
141:58 - then i would highly recommend you check
142:00 - out this
142:01 - course and you know consider joining and
142:03 - being a part of this community and
142:04 - being one of us you know and we would

143:22 - as your bible for success uses your
143:26 - bible
143:26 - for a career as a front-end developer or
143:29 - honestly a lot of what we said works as
143:31 - a full stack developer as well
143:33 - so you know the recap of like learning
143:35 - about firebase and react and
143:37 - javascript and visual studio code and
143:41 - you know uh what best framework to use
143:43 - for testing like cypress io

143:48 - should use
143:49 - you know for css and we talked about
143:52 - server side rendering
143:54 - and how the difference between a
143:56 - mid-level you know
143:57 - developer versus a senior level is
143:59 - knowing things like next js and
144:01 - using those types of things we talked
144:03 - about static side generators like gatsby
144:06 - or jekyll or hugo and all of that and we
144:08 - said hey use gatsby
144:10 - learn it so there's so much value that
144:14 - was packed in this and we just threw it
144:16 - all at you guys just make sure
144:18 - to keep going back to this to keep
144:20 - taking notes and really just following
144:22 - along
144:22 - i think personally i think
144:26 - honestly the most valuable part if i was
144:28 - watching this video
144:30 - is the part that shows you practically
144:32 - how to turn this into cash for yourself
144:35 - so yeah really pay attention to that and
144:39 - take action on it that's the one part
144:41 - that most people don't take action on
144:43 - so i just want to emphasize that yeah
144:46 - really really massive there guys in
144:48 - terms of because what you'll see here
144:49 - typically on websites and then just
144:51 - throughout
144:51 - the internet is like you'll find all of
144:53 - these skills how to do it and then you
144:55 - just don't know
144:56 - how to take that to that next level and
144:58 - that really does become a question and
145:00 - it kind of puts you in this horrible
145:01 - place
145:01 - it's very disheartening makes you kind
145:03 - of want to give up on programming so
145:05 - we really hope that we helped you out
145:07 - today and just in
145:08 - how to take that to that point of where
145:10 - you can actually start making income and
145:12 - you can actually enjoy the process a lot
145:13 - more
145:14 - because when you start earning from this
145:15 - you really do start to love it that
145:17 - extra bit
