00:00 - hey guys this is Kazi from clever
00:02 - programmer calm where you learn to code
00:07 - smarter so let's get started I
00:11 - want to cover last letter of a string
00:15 - function in this video okay so
00:18 - how do we play around with the string so
00:22 - we can get its last letter that's the
00:24 - function I want you to write should be
00:25 - very simple you should be able to get it
00:28 - pretty fast if you look at the tests
00:30 - below if you use the last letter
00:32 - function pass it hello with the
00:34 - summation mark it should give you this
00:36 - LeMay shin mark if you give it banana it
00:38 - should give you an A because a in this
00:41 - case is the last letter if you give it
00:43 - something with only one letter it should
00:45 - return that letter if you give it again
00:49 - funny guys s you get the idea so let's
00:51 - code this bad boy up again you do not
00:54 - deserve to view the solution if you
00:57 - haven't participated and try to do it on
00:59 - your own this is you got to be part of
01:02 - actively learning ok I don't want you to
01:05 - be passively learning like you're
01:07 - sitting back like eating some popcorn I
01:15 - don't want you to do that ok
01:19 - while I do agree this is kind of like
01:22 - Netflix for your career but
01:25 - I still want you to be actively learning
01:28 - ok it's like Netflix that you engage and
01:30 - participate it alright so let's get to
01:33 - coding this bad boy up notes or below
01:36 - solution notes or below exercise problem
01:39 - is below everything is there let's keep
01:42 - going define last letter
01:46 - ok now what does it take in it takes in
01:50 - some string so you can literally call it
01:52 - some string if you want to but we're
01:54 - just going to call it strength
01:56 - what does it do then
01:58 - well it's very simple it returns the
02:01 - last letter how do you return the last
02:03 - letter if I opened up a terminal and
02:05 - showed you guys how does bad boy works
02:08 - quite simple if I have a string like
02:12 - hello too it's second letter I would do
02:14 - this to get its third letter I'd do that
02:18 - to get its first letter I'd do this but
02:20 - if I wanted to get its last letter
02:21 - there's a trick in Python that you can
02:24 - do
02:25 - index by negative numbers if I do
02:28 - negative two this gives me the
02:29 - second-to-last letter which means I'm
02:31 - going to get the second L okay he'll
02:34 - last L of the word hell but if I want to
02:38 - get the last letter well I can just do
02:40 - this right it gives me the last letter
02:42 - now let's code this up return string and
02:47 - last letter okay as simple as that let's
02:52 - test our function and prove to ourselves
02:54 - that we are indeed correct and it says
02:57 - your code is correct okay that's it for
03:00 - this video if you washed up to this
03:03 - point and you haven't subscribed
03:05 - subscribed right now because you don't
03:08 - want to miss the next videos I will see
03:11 - you there
03:14 - it didn't end let's try it again
