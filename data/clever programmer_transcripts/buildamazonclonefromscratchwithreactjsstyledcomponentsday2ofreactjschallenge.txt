13:07 - thinking
13:08 - no i did not really know that's the one
13:10 - right here i'm showing you right there
13:11 - this one
13:13 - are you sure the project i'm sharing
13:15 - with you
13:16 - yeah this is the one david oh yeah this
13:19 - this is the one
13:20 - what are you talking about there all
13:21 - right david david what's wrong david so
13:23 - guys a few things that we need to do so
13:25 - let's go ahead and remove
13:26 - this deal let's remove this what i want
13:28 - you to do is i'll move this header right
13:29 - here we don't need that okay
13:31 - we need that you need the header and
13:33 - instead what i want you guys to focus on
13:35 - isn't it
13:36 - is a few things you see when you build a
13:39 - react.js project
13:40 - you build the right chest project it is
13:42 - very very simple right
13:44 - you want to think about how are we going
13:45 - to divide this project up right because
13:47 - when you think about um what's it called
13:50 - when you think about react js or
13:52 - anything or any any sort of project that
13:54 - you're building
13:55 - okay i'm going to split it up into a few
13:56 - parts okay and so what we're going to do
13:58 - right now is we're going to split up the
14:00 - components we'd like to call it all
14:01 - right
14:02 - so components are what components are
14:05 - building blocks is what i like to say so
14:07 - i'm going to say right there are
14:08 - building blocks and for example this
14:09 - header right here
14:10 - is a building block you see that right
14:12 - there that's a building block okay
14:14 - and then everything underneath the
14:15 - header is a building block right think
14:17 - of it as a block again anything that's a
14:19 - block
14:20 - it's a building block okay then what you
14:22 - got what do you have
14:24 - then you have this banner right here
14:25 - that's also a building block
14:27 - okay and then you have these small
14:29 - things right here
14:31 - and these are building blocks as well
14:33 - you see right there
14:34 - right there right there and right there
14:37 - okay so what we're going to do is we're
14:40 - going to think about a few different
14:42 - things that you know we need to work on
14:44 - in terms of to create this right
14:47 - remember
14:48 - big idea divide into small ideas okay
14:52 - so what's going to happen what's going
14:53 - to happen
14:55 - somebody says that can you make the font
14:57 - a little bigger you got it you got it i
14:58 - can make the phone a little bigger right
14:59 - here for you
15:00 - is that better i think it's better right
15:02 - i think it's better for you guys yeah
15:03 - yeah yeah i think so here we go that's
15:04 - better
15:05 - awesome so if what what i just said
15:07 - these are the guys the header so the
15:09 - first thing i'm going to do is i'm going
15:10 - to create a
15:11 - header component right that's going to
15:12 - be the part one that's for the part one
15:14 - that we're going to build so let's go
15:16 - ahead and
15:16 - look at this page you see if i refresh
15:18 - this page right if i go ahead and save
15:20 - this page and refresh this
15:21 - now it's a blank page don't worry don't
15:23 - panic it's all good
15:24 - all right no bueno all good so what i
15:27 - want to do instead is i'm going to
15:28 - create a header component because that's
15:29 - one of the building blocks that i just
15:31 - talked about right
15:33 - so this header component so what we're
15:34 - going to do is i'm going to source
15:36 - i'm going to say new file and we'll say
15:38 - header.js header.js
15:40 - right here dot gs go right there and
15:43 - that's going to be your component none
15:45 - again it's a javascript file
15:46 - but that's it it's going to contain
15:48 - everything so right as you can see
15:50 - david's already typing what he what
15:52 - david just typed i'm going to remove
15:53 - this for a second
15:54 - what david just typed is he typed in
15:55 - rfce
15:57 - oh david let me just type it hold on
15:58 - david
16:01 - rfce okay
16:04 - my bad so rscv is a shortcut
16:08 - guys when i do this it creates the
16:10 - header component right there
16:11 - and so now if i say header on here okay
16:14 - say header here and here nothing really
16:17 - shows up
16:18 - as you can see correct but but
16:21 - what do i need to do div in that in that
16:24 - case now tell me
16:24 - what do you think you need to import it
16:26 - to your application because right now
16:28 - it's just a component
16:30 - exactly so let's go ahead and import it
16:32 - i'm going to go app.js
16:34 - i will import it so what's going to
16:35 - happen is i will do it like this
16:37 - and i'll do import import guys header
16:41 - i'm going to say dot slash header right
16:44 - there
16:45 - import header header from
16:50 - from header like this like so you guys
16:52 - can see that right there beautiful right
16:54 - so it's going to import now when i say
16:56 - import header from
16:57 - it's going to import this component from
17:00 - where
17:01 - from here which is actually just right
17:04 - here just so you guys know okay just
17:06 - basically from there beautiful
17:08 - and so now what's gonna happen is that
17:10 - dave is gonna type in header as you can
17:11 - see right there
17:12 - you just type in header right there in
17:14 - header box and this is a component it's
17:17 - like a div tag
17:18 - guys right right think of it as a deal
17:20 - tag
17:21 - but it is a component and so now if i go
17:23 - ahead and save this
17:24 - i go back to here and boom right there
17:27 - you have
17:28 - the header let's go that is beautiful
17:30 - okay
17:31 - that is it right there let me go see
17:33 - what you guys are saying
17:35 - whoo let's go let's go import the jsx
17:37 - verbena what's up what's up everyone
17:39 - they're beautiful beautiful beautiful
17:41 - beautiful
17:42 - oh beautiful good night everybody love
17:45 - your content thank you so much i
17:46 - appreciate you
17:48 - thank you so much awesome so we got the
17:50 - header component now
17:51 - one thing i'm going to do is go and make
17:52 - some cleanup so i'll go to app.css i
17:55 - like to remove all this stuff we don't
17:56 - need this right here
17:58 - right then i'm going to remove all this
18:00 - stuff right here don't need this and
18:01 - what i like to add is i like to do
18:02 - margin zero
18:03 - so margins here so what is margin david
18:07 - tell me it's basically um
18:10 - so as you guys could see it everything
18:12 - was centered in the in the very center
18:15 - and we just removed all the all the
18:16 - styling now in terms of margin
18:19 - that's um little
18:24 - something on the very side and it's just
18:26 - a few
18:27 - uh pixels usually now it's going to be
18:29 - zeroed out so basically
18:31 - everything that you put into your
18:32 - application is going to be snapped to
18:34 - the side
18:35 - of your window beautiful exactly so it's
18:37 - not on the side of the window beautiful
18:38 - which is exactly what so now you can see
18:40 - here header now you see this right here
18:42 - it's now to the side of the window as
18:44 - you guys see right there all right
18:46 - beautiful
18:47 - so now because i had a js one thing i
18:49 - want to do is i want to create the css
18:50 - file but actually we're not going to use
18:51 - css for this we're going to use
18:52 - something called
18:54 - style components which is the really
18:56 - cool part okay
18:57 - don't worry about okay what we'll say so
18:59 - on the header
19:01 - what's going to happen if we think about
19:02 - this let's go and now divide up the
19:04 - header here's our amazon clone right
19:06 - there
19:06 - okay what do we have in header well we
19:08 - have a few things all right let's think
19:10 - about this and go rectangle
19:11 - so here's a header here's a header right
19:14 - here beautiful
19:15 - now how do we divide this very simple
19:18 - well we have the logo
19:19 - right we had the say hello address
19:22 - okay we have the search bar we have what
19:26 - we have the hello nazari account list
19:30 - and then what else do we have what else
19:32 - do we have tell me huh
19:34 - and then we also have the returns orders
19:36 - and then we have a card section
19:38 - right there you see guys so by having
19:40 - these specific components we now
19:41 - know what to create so let's think of
19:43 - this i'm going to keep this on here
19:44 - so let's go and do this um
19:48 - david let's create the first component
19:50 - which is the name should be let's go
19:52 - ahead and name
19:53 - the component uh what should we call
19:55 - this the
19:56 - component huh tell me let's do header
19:58 - logo component okay
19:59 - so let's create a component called
20:01 - header logo yes

25:30 - snipping hot tell me so basically
25:33 - this is uh these are two span tags
25:37 - with their specific class names and it's
25:40 - just
25:41 - uh it's just saying the word hello on
25:43 - the top
25:45 - and the one down below is saying select
25:47 - your address
25:48 - it's basically the the little piece if
25:51 - you go to amazon.com
25:53 - you will see the exact same stuff
25:55 - exactly so kind of like when you do
25:56 - hellos like your
25:57 - as you can see right and so we can do
25:59 - these are here guys
26:00 - oh and we have another donation let me
26:02 - see let me see let me see
26:04 - now donation hey let's go
26:07 - thank you so much just love the videos
26:09 - thank you so much akito appreciate it
26:11 - chf2 what is that i'm not really sure
26:12 - what that is oh uh
26:14 - that's that's swiss right yeah i'm not
26:17 - really sure that is
26:18 - but guys check this out so what's going
26:19 - to happen is this hello is a span tag
26:21 - and we're going to convert this into an
26:23 - actual style component
26:24 - so what we're going to do is this option
26:26 - line one
26:27 - i'm going to say here const option
26:31 - line one right line that far
26:35 - okay option line one yes i want to go
26:37 - that far equals
26:38 - style.div okay right there beautiful
26:42 - style.div and and then so forth i'm
26:45 - going to we're going to add a style in a
26:46 - second here and then we'll do
26:47 - const option what is it line two
26:53 - option line two right there is equal to
26:57 - also style that div
26:59 - style dot div right there
27:02 - that div okay so and that's also gonna
27:04 - be where we put the css and so forth so
27:07 - we can that
27:07 - we got these four components at this
27:09 - point right here and you can see david
27:11 - right here is create them into
27:12 - components so option line one option
27:14 - line
27:15 - two inside the header option address
27:18 - okay beautiful beautiful beautiful so
27:20 - what's gonna happen now at this point is
27:22 - we need to style them but
27:23 - let's see what we've got so far all
27:25 - right so it says style is not defined
27:28 - i think it's because they probably spell
27:30 - the wrong style
27:32 - style is not defined there we go style
27:35 - is not put it in past tense
27:36 - oh man grammar bro
27:40 - style come on save it okay ops and line
27:43 - watch so
27:44 - style's not defined let me go hey there
27:47 - we go beautiful
27:48 - beautiful right there so it says hello
27:49 - it's like your address now
27:51 - okay now the one thing you have to think
27:53 - about is you see this header
27:55 - logo this header logo is basically
27:59 - the logo now we definitely technically
28:00 - we should have put this height on the
28:01 - not the logo but technically we should
28:03 - put this on the
28:04 - on the actual container yeah there we go
28:06 - the header level right thank you so
28:07 - we'll do
28:08 - basically i just uh deleted the div from
28:11 - here
28:11 - yes yes yes yes and then i'm just going
28:14 - to go ahead and create a new
28:15 - style component so instead of doing div
28:17 - we do create a header
28:19 - the reason why is because this will
28:21 - allow us to add the css with style
28:23 - components all right
28:24 - beautiful so let's go ahead and add that
28:26 - there i can just paste it in here where
28:28 - i have it
28:29 - right there beautiful right there you go
28:30 - ahead awesome sweet sweet so it's going
28:32 - to save this
28:33 - all right and what do we have so far it
28:35 - says does some error it's okay if you
28:37 - refresh this no problem
28:39 - const header style dot do
28:42 - oh we can't we have to do we have to
28:44 - make a container bro
28:46 - container like this you cannot just call
28:48 - it like that
28:49 - there you go oh really because the class
28:52 - name is the header that's why
28:56 - there we go see look at that i know you
28:59 - can't see anything on here right it says
29:00 - hello select your eyes that's the only
29:01 - thing you can see but that's pretty much
29:02 - it so
29:03 - next thing i want to do is after the
29:05 - option solid address let's go and
29:07 - actually add the logo in here okay
29:09 - and the logo is what is just an image
29:11 - source so i'm gonna do image here
29:13 - so let me go and do this part now so
29:15 - we'll do image
29:17 - image right here image source is equal
29:20 - to something
29:21 - don't worry about that just yet okay and
29:23 - we're gonna
29:24 - close it out now right there now
29:27 - the image source is i mean it's an image
29:29 - right so
29:30 - the image that we have here is actually
29:32 - right there let me go ahead and get this
29:34 - image for you i'm going to give it
29:36 - i have this image logo which is actually
29:38 - here i will put this for you guys in the
29:40 - comments so you guys can have it okay
29:42 - beautiful this is the image you see
29:43 - there's the amazon logo image so
29:45 - let's go ahead and do that i'm gonna
29:46 - paste it into here i'm gonna make it as
29:48 - a string
29:49 - boom right there and done so save that
29:52 - all right amazing oh
29:54 - let's go david if you can go ahead and
29:57 - copy that image url this imagery
30:00 - the people that's already in the
30:01 - comments guys you're the best bro
30:03 - you're the best you're the best awesome
30:06 - we're gonna put it to facebook
30:08 - yeah well that's that's that's in a
30:09 - second here so so now
30:11 - let's think about this okay we have this
30:12 - logo here right
30:14 - and then what else do we have well we
30:16 - have the logo here and now we have the
30:18 - hello select your edges
30:19 - we now need to put them side by side
30:23 - okay now how do we do that right because
30:26 - we look when we look at this right
30:27 - i mean this is side by side correct side
30:30 - by side right
30:31 - so what we do is we use something called
30:33 - display
30:34 - flex all right display flex so what's
30:37 - going to happen is
30:38 - i'm going to go the container and i will
30:40 - say display
30:42 - display flex on
30:45 - the container so save that
30:48 - okay uh let's see what happens now okay
30:51 - so nothing happens at this point okay
30:54 - right
30:54 - now we're going to do is what what he's
30:56 - doing what david is doing is doing a
30:58 - line item
30:58 - center to center everything vertically
31:01 - and if i go ahead and save this to make
31:02 - sure
31:03 - and then he's going to just justify
31:04 - content center don't worry about that
31:05 - don't worry don't worry about the
31:06 - justification just yet okay
31:08 - just do a lineup center for now so you
31:10 - can see the amazon clone is not a line
31:12 - center but it's still horrible guys
31:13 - right
31:14 - why is that akito says my last
31:18 - credit for you guys thank you so much i
31:20 - appreciate you let's go
31:22 - beautiful beautiful beautiful thank you

31:25 - epic i love you guys uh love so much
31:28 - love for everybody
31:29 - that's always good to hear all right
31:30 - perfect so we got that portion
31:32 - um now let's go focus on the image
31:35 - itself so if we have this header logo
31:37 - right let's focus on the image let's do
31:39 - image
31:40 - we'll do image and on the image what i
31:43 - want to do
31:44 - is well technically a few things i'm
31:46 - going to give it a width of 100
31:48 - 100 pixels what 100 pixels
31:52 - right there there and then what i'm
31:54 - going to do is i'm going to give it what
31:57 - well nothing because look if i give it a
32:00 - width of 100 pixels that's it look at
32:01 - this guys this is done you see this
32:03 - right here
32:03 - the amazon logo only has a 100 pixels
32:06 - the height will change automatically
32:08 - and so it's no longer a hideous amazon
32:10 - logo that's over
32:11 - on everything that we don't need you
32:12 - know what i mean but
32:14 - boom it's all done right there one thing
32:17 - i'm gonna do is i'm gonna give some
32:18 - margin to us i'm gonna say margin left
32:20 - margin left 11 pixels
32:24 - right there so save that module i like
32:26 - pixels and so that get adds some space
32:28 - so now just so you know guys
32:29 - so you guys know what is margin well
32:31 - margin is very simple right if i go
32:33 - ahead and do this right here
32:35 - if this is the container right the
32:37 - margin
32:39 - is a space right there is a space right
32:42 - here
32:43 - boom right little space on the side it's
32:45 - a space
32:46 - you know on the side it's like almost
32:48 - like for example if you have
32:49 - i don't know let's just have a piece of
32:51 - paper let's just say this right you guys
32:53 - got a piece of paper okay
32:54 - the margin is this space okay it's the
32:57 - space right there
32:58 - same thing here it's a space here right
33:00 - it's a space here
33:01 - the patty on the other hand that's a
33:02 - space inside that's so called padding
33:04 - guys just so you know all right
33:05 - beautiful so i know that's some

33:14 - we've got the amazon logo that's great

33:19 - is
33:20 - next david huh what do you think uh so
33:24 - next

33:30 - see what the text is
33:32 - let's see it let's see it color white
33:35 - nice i think it's a i think it's a good

33:52 - component how about that okay that's
33:54 - fine that's fine that's fine so
33:55 - okay so let's continue laying out the
33:57 - structure so we have the header option
33:58 - address right here

36:44 - simple things so we got the input
36:46 - what's the next one after that one going
36:48 - to be which is the hello account as ours
36:49 - list what can we do for that one
36:51 - david huh tell me uh before we do that
36:54 - we will need to add another thing it's
36:57 - going to be just an icon
36:59 - okay which icon it's a part of the
37:02 - header search
37:03 - okay let's do that right now header whoa
37:09 - we are at 452 likes you guys are
37:12 - the best that's all i can say to you
37:17 - beautiful all right sweet sweet sweet so
37:19 - had a search container right there
37:21 - and so the icon that he's working on is
37:23 - very simple he's working on this icon
37:26 - right here header search icon container
37:28 - right so
37:29 - it's going to be orange and then it's
37:31 - going to have an icon inside so
37:32 - now let's think about though the big
37:34 - question is how do we get this icon how
37:36 - do we get this icon david huh
37:38 - all right for that we should be using
37:40 - material ui
37:41 - yes yes so check this out guys
37:45 - we use material ui icons material ui
37:49 - icons right there beautiful sweet sweet
37:51 - sweet it's
37:52 - basically a completely free icon set
37:55 - provided by google
37:56 - open source i'm not sure if it's open
37:58 - source but you can use it you can use
38:00 - the problem so it's open source
38:01 - so i can click search for example i can
38:03 - type in search and hopefully it gives me
38:05 - search
38:06 - come on all right doesn't like doesn't
38:08 - want to give me a search
38:10 - unless google is broken or something
38:13 - there you go you see so i got the search
38:14 - these are all the search icons i have in
38:16 - front of me here
38:17 - and so i click on by the way it tells me
38:20 - how do we go ahead and get it so i'm
38:21 - going to go ahead and copy this right
38:23 - here
38:24 - boom i'm going to import it on my side
38:27 - of the code
38:28 - okay good so we just copied that icon
38:31 - okay
38:32 - now of course we still don't have access
38:34 - to this guys
38:35 - because why we need to also now install
38:38 - it so you can see david here what's he
38:39 - doing here
38:40 - well he's installing it right there
38:43 - right there you see that right there
38:44 - he's installing npm user ui install
38:48 - npm material ui core and also install
38:52 - material ui icons right so two things
38:56 - two things guys two things thus let's
38:59 - see what we do let's see how this works
39:02 - good good good good good good good so we
39:04 - got that
39:05 - all right we got this let's install the
39:07 - immature ui core
39:08 - guys make sure to pay attention for the
39:11 - order first you have to install the core
39:14 - then you can install the icons
39:16 - okay because the icon is built on top of
39:18 - the core good awesome
39:20 - all right so that's perfect we've got
39:21 - that specific portion
39:23 - so now if we're going to use this you
39:25 - see now we can actually use the search
39:26 - icon
39:26 - and to use it all i gotta do is just
39:28 - type it in like this it's just like a
39:29 - component right there
39:30 - you see yeah it's actually a component
39:33 - david you're so fast at this i just
39:34 - don't understand what it did
39:38 - all right one thing we're saying here is
39:40 - a header search container is not defined
39:41 - the reason why is because we need to go
39:42 - ahead and create the component so i will
39:44 - say
39:44 - const i see a num faster than david
39:47 - header
39:48 - header search
39:49 - [Laughter]
39:52 - search container this one okay container
39:55 - right there is equal to what styled
39:59 - dots
40:02 - there we go gotta save that let's go
40:06 - it still says not defined probably
40:07 - because i've misspelled it header
40:10 - search container let me see here's a
40:13 - container right there
40:14 - uh come on come on do us do with me
40:16 - there we go
40:18 - icon container that's the one now so
40:20 - check this out
40:21 - you can see this you see how this icon
40:23 - is right here again we can fix that by
40:25 - using what
40:26 - something called display flex okay
40:29 - so header search is right here and so
40:32 - what we will do is we'll go to header
40:33 - search which is where is it
40:35 - right there we'll see display flex on
40:37 - this one
40:39 - good save that and boom right there you
40:42 - got yourself that thing that you wanted
40:43 - the whole time okay it's as easy as that
40:46 - guys all right
40:47 - after that guys what's gonna happen is
40:49 - we've got the logo
40:50 - let's go and continue on and continue
40:52 - building that structure okay what's next
40:54 - exactly so next up we got the header
40:56 - knob items
40:58 - good and those are gonna be like
41:00 - everything else
41:01 - on the right hand side so if you can uh
41:03 - take a look if you can show us the
41:05 - finished product yes right there um
41:08 - it's going to be everything from hello
41:10 - nazari
41:11 - account list something that returns and
41:14 - orders
41:15 - and even the card icon with the number
41:18 - okay right there returns orders and the
41:19 - card icon right there
41:20 - beautiful yes yes yes yes yes yes cool
41:24 - all right um so for that uh we're gonna
41:26 - be just creating a brand new
41:28 - um style.div which is gonna be header
41:33 - um nav items never items yep
41:38 - that's another style component and this
41:39 - is going to contain what this one's
41:41 - going to contain
41:42 - all these things things okay
41:45 - so we're going to have the header option
41:48 - one that's the one well you can use the
41:50 - same one option line one option line two
41:52 - right
41:53 - no no that's going to be inside of this
41:55 - one because we have the hello and azari
41:59 - it should be the same should the same
42:09 - okay fine fine fine david fine fine fine
42:12 - fine
42:14 - then you have option line one option
42:16 - line two exactly got it
42:18 - okay okay all right so again what's
42:19 - going on here guys right so we have the
42:21 - header nav item so just so you know okay
42:22 - we have the header nav items right here
42:24 - okay
42:27 - basically they had enough items and then
42:29 - the way we're going to connect this
42:30 - is this portion the hello account azaris
42:33 - that could be header option
42:35 - and then this is also going to be a
42:36 - header option right here
42:38 - right there right there you see we have
42:40 - option line one that's gonna be hello
42:42 - account azaris which is going to be here
42:44 - so if we go ahead and check this out
42:45 - let's go ahead and do hello
42:48 - hola so hello comma
42:52 - comma good good go sorry and then
42:56 - the last one's gonna be what
42:59 - hello account and list good and finally
43:02 - the last time from here is going to be
43:04 - returns
43:04 - so let's go and type in returns guys
43:07 - returns
43:08 - good good right there right there good
43:11 - right there so you can see what we just
43:12 - did right we create these components
43:14 - header option
43:15 - header option right both of both of
43:17 - these are header options right here okay
43:20 - that's gonna be the header nav items and
43:22 - i think the last one that we have to
43:23 - that one is gonna be the header option
43:25 - cart okay that is correct yes yes
43:29 - so let me go ahead and actually type
43:30 - that one out let me type that one out
43:32 - option yeah i'll do that sorry yeah it's
43:34 - faster okay
43:35 - oh i see how it is okay you can take it
43:37 - over from here
43:38 - you can take it so header option card
43:40 - there's a few things that i had an
43:41 - option card which is
43:42 - going to be guys this one right there
43:44 - okay just so you know header
43:45 - option card now for the header option
43:48 - card a few things need to create
43:49 - number one the card itself number two
43:52 - is the number correct so let's try that
43:55 - so the first one is going to be the card
43:57 - i'm going to go to the material icons
43:59 - let's go and start searching cart
44:02 - cart let's see right there this is a
44:05 - good one you see the shopping basket i
44:06 - kind of like that one it's going to copy
44:08 - this one
44:09 - go to copy the shopping basket go back
44:11 - to our thing
44:12 - it's going to import it here voila
44:15 - boom that gives us that that's awesome
44:18 - good good good good good and so now if
44:21 - you look at our thing
44:22 - holy shmack money
44:26 - guacamole holy guacamole so many things
44:29 - that we have do
44:30 - are not defined guys okay so many things
44:32 - but again
44:33 - it is completely completely okay hey
44:37 - all right superb guys good good good
44:39 - good good good good
44:41 - so so the first thing to do is go ahead
44:43 - let's go ahead and all these things said
44:44 - undefined
44:45 - let's create them so you can see he's
44:48 - already on it so we have header
44:49 - option which is not defined next we're
44:51 - going to create is the header nav
44:53 - items right there good oh yeah
44:58 - good good good that's going to create
45:00 - the hand items david
45:03 - yes so constant high enough items
45:07 - nice and then the header option cart
45:10 - right there okay
45:12 - we got that already got that all right
45:13 - so we've created these styles of this
45:15 - and they're empty i mean they're not i
45:16 - mean they
45:17 - they and so we have a low account list
45:19 - and returns and notice
45:20 - now again horrible horrible thing right
45:24 - how do we go ahead and now put these to
45:27 - be alongside
45:28 - well we use the display flags to put
45:30 - them outside so just remember just
45:31 - memorize that if you want something side
45:34 - by side
45:35 - then flex side it does that make sense
45:37 - flex excited
45:37 - [Laughter]
45:40 - you just came up with this right yeah
45:42 - the display flex it how about that
45:45 - oh yeah exactly so display flex save
45:48 - that you just
45:49 - save it you just need to save it let's
45:51 - go
45:52 - there we go beautiful all right for the
45:54 - i had an option card let's go and
45:56 - actually use this shopping bask icon
45:57 - shopping shopping basket icon
46:01 - i will place that into here right there
46:10 - okay so we got the basket icon right
46:12 - there and now let's go ahead
46:13 - and get the the actual card count so i'm
46:16 - going to create a new component called
46:17 - card account
46:19 - card count right there boom
46:22 - that's like this boom card count and
46:24 - let's say for now i'm going to put a
46:26 - placeholder that's going to say for
46:27 - example five
46:28 - four for just just four for now so let's
46:31 - go down to here
46:32 - let's go to const
46:35 - const cart count is
46:38 - equal to style.diff right
46:44 - [Music]
46:46 - oh come on it's right there you guys
46:49 - okay good good good
46:52 - sometimes i know i know i know so now
46:55 - a lot of things have happened here at
46:56 - this point you can see we've got the
46:59 - pretty much the fundamental of this
47:01 - header okay now
47:02 - one thing to do is let's go and style
47:05 - this hello nazari and accounts
47:06 - list right there to be more like the way
47:09 - it should be okay
47:10 - so let's check it out well for the uh
47:12 - the actual header option
47:13 - line one uh well line two this line two
47:17 - we need to actually make that
47:18 - into a font weight of 700 so let's go
47:21 - ahead and go to do
47:22 - option line two let's go ahead and do
47:24 - this font wait
47:27 - wait wait wait wait
47:31 - you like that that thing when you go to
47:32 - you press the button says wait
47:36 - not talking about no oh [ __ ] okay never
47:39 - mind
47:39 - [Laughter]
47:42 - all right so there you go you see now
47:44 - this right here is more has more weight
47:46 - on it so does this is more bold and so
47:47 - is this more bold now
47:48 - one thing i'll be asking okay so now is
47:50 - how do we go ahead and actually space
47:51 - this out spaces out properly well
47:53 - how do we space these things out
47:55 - properly well here's what we can do
47:58 - on the container you see those items
48:00 - align items guys just so you know
48:02 - that centers it vertically okay now
48:06 - justify content centers it horizontally
48:09 - but there's different methods to it if i
48:11 - go to
48:12 - flexbox flexbox for example
48:16 - okay xbox oh damn david just already
48:19 - gave it the answer
48:20 - holy moly ah it's nothing okay so
48:23 - flexbox you see
48:24 - this needs to be your friend your best
48:27 - friend
48:28 - in the world okay here's why because
48:31 - this is going to explain how flexbox
48:32 - works so you can see you have a
48:34 - container right there
48:35 - and these are the children these are the
48:37 - div items and
48:38 - we can number one we can put them in
48:40 - horizontal or vertical fashion if i
48:42 - wanted to
48:43 - or if i for example i want to wrap them
48:45 - and then look at this
48:46 - look at this check this out you see
48:48 - there's justified content
48:49 - i can space them out evenly i can space
48:52 - them out in between
48:53 - i can center them if i wanted to flex
48:55 - and like start pretty much
48:56 - anything i want
49:00 - understood good now this is the vertical
49:03 - alignment align
49:04 - items right there flex start flex end
49:06 - center
49:07 - stretch and so forth as you can see
49:09 - beautiful so we can use that now guys
49:11 - okay
49:12 - let's use that let's go ahead and go to
49:13 - here and we'll say justify content
49:16 - justify content content what
49:20 - space between space between
49:25 - basically what it's gonna do it's gonna
49:27 - make sure that the space
49:29 - between the children is equal exactly so
49:31 - if i go to amazon
49:33 - oh would you look at that
49:36 - okay would you look at that so
49:39 - exactly that's awesome right that is
49:41 - amazing so beautiful so now let's think
49:43 - about this
49:44 - okay now let's think about the um
49:51 - let me think about that i mean do it for
49:53 - uh
49:54 - nav items as well yeah i'll do it for
49:57 - nav items too
49:58 - so for the net but i mean i don't want
49:59 - like for me for these ones these ones we
50:01 - just need to add them proper padding for
50:02 - these ones
50:03 - so let's go now to the header
50:06 - where is it nav items now i love these
50:08 - ones so
50:09 - guys what do you guys think if we want
50:11 - to go ahead let me know
50:12 - in the comments below if i want to go
50:14 - ahead and add spacing right in between
50:16 - these specific things
50:18 - what do you think we need to do tell me
50:20 - what do you think is something we need
50:21 - to do huh you
50:22 - guys tell me put in the comments below
50:23 - okay i'm very curious what you know
50:25 - okay for what you learned so far well
50:28 - for these ones the header option kind of
50:31 - the header
50:32 - option well a few things we're gonna do
50:34 - padding for these ones okay
50:36 - let me go to header option right here
50:38 - right there again remember
50:40 - header option are these specific divs
50:42 - okay
50:44 - so for the header option let's do
50:45 - padding
50:47 - padding uh what should we do patterning
50:51 - left playing left nine pixels
50:55 - left nine pixels beautiful padding left
50:58 - nine pixels and then after that what's
50:59 - going to happen is what
51:01 - is that's gonna give it some padding lat
51:02 - nine pixels then we'll do
51:05 - padding uh putting right nine pixels
51:12 - heading right
51:15 - right nine pixels good good good good
51:18 - good good
51:19 - and then what's gonna happen padding top
51:25 - panning this top is gonna be which one
51:28 - good padding top is what
51:29 - 10 pixels good and then finally penny
51:32 - bottom
51:35 - bottom 10 pixels oh
51:38 - let's go oh not one pixel 10 pixels
51:42 - not even trouble huh come on
51:45 - i know hold on hold your horses man i
51:48 - know you want to do the trouble thing so
51:49 - check this out now guys
51:50 - you see how we just add a penny right
51:52 - there and let me see what you guys said
51:54 - because i think a lot of you guys have
51:55 - said the right answer let me see a lot
51:57 - of you guys said the right answer on the
51:58 - whole common stuff
52:00 - go let me see let me see learning so
52:02 - much for now thank you that's amazing
52:04 - i'm that's i'm pumped good padding
52:07 - somebody said could you do 10 pixels yes
52:09 - good cuttings that's a good one too
52:12 - that's a good one too i like that one
52:14 - so padding heading left tell you need
52:18 - space
52:20 - that's a funny one hold your horses
52:23 - hey sheila oh that's funny
52:27 - padding good good good guys good job
52:28 - good job so now let's think about this
52:30 - so we got that portion now we can
52:32 - convert this side guys
52:34 - to actually something shorter it's
52:36 - called trouble
52:38 - look at this i want you to pay attention
52:39 - to this really quickly okay i'm gonna
52:40 - increase the size of this even bigger
52:42 - now padding look at this padding
52:46 - and check this out i want you trouble
52:48 - top so i want you to memorize this
52:50 - specific word
52:51 - right so i'm gonna say trouble
52:56 - trouble right there okay now what does
52:58 - this mean is very simple
53:00 - ah [ __ ] hold on trouble
53:05 - right there okay all right so what does
53:09 - this mean it's very simple guys
53:11 - if you want to think about this so go
53:13 - ahead uh so add the amount of padding
53:15 - for this david go ahead and do it
53:16 - do it from there do it with me right
53:18 - there
53:19 - let's do it so 10 pixels so 10 this can
53:22 - be stand for top
53:24 - you see then this right here is going to
53:27 - stand for
53:28 - right that's the right side
53:31 - good this trouble then b it's going to
53:34 - stand for
53:34 - bottom good and then
53:38 - the last one this is going to be left
53:41 - that's going to say for our left right
53:44 - there
53:44 - so trouble top right bottom
53:47 - left right top right bottom left
53:51 - right and you can replace all of this
53:53 - just using this short hand really nicely
53:55 - guys you see that yes or no
53:57 - really really nice really good really
53:58 - cool right and so now i can
54:01 - remove all this stuff boom voila
54:05 - oh look at that guys cheeky picky
54:08 - and then we're all good huh yeah am i
54:11 - right
54:13 - oh 522 likes guys let's get to 600. can
54:17 - we get this 600 likes
54:19 - i'll know you guys can do it let's go
54:20 - let's go
54:23 - all right beautiful i did it can you go
54:26 - ahead and continue coding and what are
54:27 - we going to do work on next and actually
54:28 - that's going to work on this
54:29 - input this let's work on this specific
54:32 - import okay
54:33 - i like that this one you see the search
54:35 - box that's working down right now yes
54:38 - all right so the storage
54:42 - uh we will need to first fix how the uh
54:45 - header search as a div looks like right
54:50 - where are we at okay there we go good
54:52 - good good continue continue on
54:55 - okay here we go god now heather search
54:58 - we want to make sure that it
54:59 - uses as much space as it possibly gets
55:02 - some water
55:02 - can what's up
55:05 - i'm gonna get some water oh yeah okay so
55:08 - um so for the heather search we want to
55:12 - make sure that it uses
55:13 - all the space that it actually has so
55:15 - for that we will be saying flex dash
55:18 - grow mm-hmm meaning grow as much as
55:21 - possible okay think about it as like
55:23 - for example you know let's say like like
55:26 - let's say this is taking up space you
55:27 - see this thing that's taking on space
55:28 - right
55:29 - if i want to grow as much as possible i
55:30 - say flex grow one so it's gonna be as
55:31 - big as possible like
55:33 - this big you know what i mean that's
55:34 - gonna be flag scroll one
55:36 - okay all right exactly all right
55:40 - and um it's just gonna use like it's
55:43 - gonna stretch out all the way but it's
55:45 - only gonna be the container for now
55:47 - correct because the container guys you
55:48 - can see is this one right there
55:50 - that's the container right which is this
55:51 - so if you see it's stretching as much as
55:53 - i can
55:54 - and that's the container guys okay
55:56 - exactly
55:57 - good that's gonna continue on now for
56:00 - the
56:00 - we we obviously want to make sure that
56:02 - the actual input
56:04 - is going to do the exact same so let's
56:07 - see how it looks like
56:08 - up here so we got the uh header search
56:12 - input okay good good component
56:16 - and we want to make sure that that takes
56:18 - up as much space as it can
56:20 - as well so we will do flex grow
56:23 - one in there too and if i save it from
56:27 - here it might not go
56:28 - oops there we go okay so hopefully you
56:31 - guys can actually
56:32 - see that uh on the top top of the screen
56:35 - it actually shrinked all the way till
56:37 - the very end
56:38 - and now even the search box search
56:41 - uh input box is actually uh using all
56:45 - the space it can
56:47 - now next up um because we already have
56:50 - the display facts
56:52 - we just want to make sure that it is uh
56:55 - the right beautiful look at that you see
56:56 - that this input is
56:58 - fully growing right there beautiful and
57:00 - then that's awesome so that's gonna be
57:01 - flex curl one
57:02 - so again guys let's go one it's actually
57:04 - defined here inside
57:06 - inside flexbox as you can see let me see
57:09 - let me
57:09 - go back to here
57:13 - see if like shrink and then flex curl
57:15 - right there you see so for example this
57:17 - two is a flex girl one right here okay
57:19 - that's going to grow more than anything
57:21 - else that's what you guys need to
57:22 - understand all right
57:23 - good uh let's go ahead and continue on
57:26 - all right cool um so what we will do
57:29 - next up is we want to make sure
57:31 - that the uh the
57:34 - uh container
57:38 - is 40 pixels high so we're just gonna
57:40 - say height
57:42 - of 40 pixels um
57:45 - let me save it nice beautiful okay
57:49 - that's much better much better right
57:52 - yeah so much better
57:53 - and uh we want to give it a border
57:55 - radius of four pixels
57:56 - so it's just going to um make a
58:00 - circular and a border radius guys that's
58:02 - sharp in your border is it can you see
58:04 - if i go ahead and zoom in on here
58:05 - you see how so sharp it's like it's like
58:07 - edgy i don't like it right so
58:09 - a border base is gonna make it basically
58:11 - smooth
58:12 - it's gonna be smooth so let's go ahead
58:14 - and do this
58:15 - what so look at that
58:19 - it's still not fully smooth for a
58:20 - certain so for the suga let's go ahead
58:22 - and do for the border
58:23 - because that's because i forgot to put
58:25 - the pigs there but now it should be
58:27 - smooth
58:28 - now it's still not going to be smooth
58:29 - actually yeah no it's not
58:31 - there's there's a reason why but don't
58:32 - worry about that we'll talk about that
58:33 - in a second here why
58:34 - it's not smooth but i want you to what i
58:36 - want us to work on actually now david
58:38 - is let's work on this search box you see
58:40 - this search container
58:41 - so header search icon container
58:44 - because down has a very very special
58:46 - styling for that one all right so let's
58:48 - work on that one right now where did i
58:49 - lose it
58:51 - there we go i lost it here ah come on
58:55 - good so and for this one it's going to
58:57 - be very simple

62:56 - rocking you so a few things i want you
63:00 - guys now to do let's go ahead and
63:01 - continue on okay we're not done yet and
63:03 - we're not done anywhere
63:04 - we're not close to it yet so you see
63:06 - look now let's take a look at this
63:07 - border
63:08 - radius remember how did this border
63:09 - radius here and the header search right
63:11 - there
63:12 - well check this out the reason why the
63:14 - border race is not
63:15 - fully there is a following reason if i
63:17 - right click and spec dump on this one
63:18 - let's go and take a look at this where
63:21 - is it where's our header search well
63:23 - it's pretty much
63:24 - here this is the header search and if we
63:25 - go and take a look at the css applied to
63:27 - it
63:28 - border radius okay you see that right
63:30 - there it's border with four pixels right
63:31 - there that's the one okay beautiful
63:33 - it's not applied because of overflow
63:35 - look at this if i do overflow
63:38 - hidden oh uh-huh
63:42 - yeah yeah that's what i thought exactly
63:48 - boom you can see that right there this
63:50 - is a much
63:51 - better now circular you see it actually
63:53 - has a nice concave shape to it now
63:55 - that's exactly what we want okay so we
63:57 - got that portion that's just good
63:59 - let's finish up with that with this
64:01 - input box which
64:02 - look which needs a little bit of fixing
64:04 - which what are some things that you need
64:06 - to
64:06 - need to tell me david so definitely a
64:09 - fix that we
64:10 - we we can't just miss and it just bugs
64:13 - my eyes for
64:14 - the last i don't know how many minutes
64:16 - that we have that
64:17 - go ahead but what i definitely want to
64:19 - do is
64:20 - making sure that it doesn't light up in
64:23 - the glue
64:24 - when you click inside right okay go
64:27 - ahead
64:28 - so what i want to do is i want to type
64:30 - in focus
64:31 - uh with a column okay so basically on
64:33 - the focus of this input
64:35 - so when i say focus it means when i
64:36 - click on this you see when i click on
64:38 - this
64:38 - right there see how there's this blue
64:40 - hideous box
64:41 - the way we know that it has blues is
64:43 - hideous box because if i do focus on
64:45 - this and if i do for example
64:46 - if i right click on this and i do four
64:48 - state focus you can see right there
64:50 - and i go to here you can see this is
64:53 - there's this
64:54 - hideous outline right there you see this
64:57 - in the
64:57 - right there where is it where is it
64:59 - where is it right there in the before
65:00 - state again
65:01 - put four state it's a hideous outline
65:04 - that's this
65:05 - it's just so ugh look at this horrible
65:08 - right
65:08 - so what we do is we say focus outline
65:11 - none which will remove that portion
65:13 - and so now when i go ahead and refresh
65:15 - this since i save this here
65:18 - boom beautiful it's exactly what i want
65:22 - so much better so so much better okay
65:25 - next up
65:26 - next i want to do is let's go ahead and
65:27 - do the following thing which is
65:29 - got the flex girl one that's awesome
65:31 - what is this
65:32 - weird trickery going on here do you see
65:35 - what i mean
65:36 - with this you know there's like space in
65:38 - between the the header
65:40 - search container and everything like
65:41 - that do you see that right there
65:43 - it's weird right here you see this right
65:44 - here
65:47 - there's like something going on i'm not
65:49 - sure what it is but it's something going
65:50 - on it's
65:50 - really odd i'm not sure what it is
65:52 - exactly exactly sure what you're
65:55 - showing but let me see probably there
65:59 - oh yeah that way let's see input let me
66:02 - see
66:02 - margin zero that's fine
66:06 - let's girl one which is fine that's all
66:08 - good i like that
66:10 - okay so maybe you don't need to focus
66:11 - too much on it because i don't want to
66:12 - focus too much on it on this specific
66:14 - portion instead i want to focus on the
66:15 - other stuff
66:16 - which is i want to go ahead and focus
66:18 - away because there's this div right here
66:20 - too
66:22 - color black which is good that's all
66:24 - right yeah div
66:25 - should be the icon so i mean this
66:29 - search icon thingy because no it's fine
66:32 - yeah yeah that's fine so i think the
66:35 - nice thing to focus on is let's go to
66:36 - add some spacing around these
66:38 - specific portions okay so this portion
66:41 - and so forth so
66:42 - for the hello select your address let's
66:44 - go back to here where is
66:46 - it this one right here option line one
66:48 - option line
66:50 - two a few things we need to create here
66:52 - on the hello select your address which
66:53 - is gonna be what
66:55 - what is it gonna be i mean you
66:58 - definitely
66:59 - uh add a little margin right to the
67:01 - header option address
67:03 - good good good go that way that way we
67:05 - don't have to worry about the rows then
67:07 - uh
67:07 - themselves um
67:11 - so i'm not sure if you want to scroll
67:13 - down or not all right one thing i want
67:15 - to do for the okay so a few things i
67:16 - want to do i want to go ahead for the
67:17 - option address right here
67:19 - this option address i here's a really
67:21 - cool thing i can do command click on
67:23 - this and this watch should take me
67:24 - straight to it you see this button
67:25 - before look at this
67:27 - i know cool right now i have to scroll
67:29 - down yeah i know
67:30 - i know chicory stuff huh so command
67:32 - click or control click on it for example
67:34 - if you're on windows
67:35 - so i can do for example padding for this
67:38 - one i will say padding left
67:42 - left let's go ahead and do 9 pixels so
67:44 - you actually kind of move it a little
67:46 - bit more to where i want it to be
67:48 - okay good all right that's awesome so
67:50 - that's more padding
67:51 - and i want to add more padding as well
67:53 - to the
67:54 - the header search itself too i think
67:58 - that's going to going to be really
67:59 - really important okay
68:00 - so on that specific portion let's go
68:03 - ahead and do
68:06 - also let's go to header where is it i'm
68:08 - going to close this out
68:10 - and we'll do do a header where's the
68:12 - header search where is it where's the
68:13 - rest of the header search
68:15 - there we go so command click on the
68:17 - header search right there
68:19 - beautiful and then what i will do in
68:21 - this case is pretty simple
68:23 - is i will go ahead and do
68:26 - padding left five pixels yeah actually
68:29 - no yeah let's do that
68:30 - let's do i mean yeah you can add like
68:32 - horizontal padding

73:39 - ahead and do that let's go ahead and do
73:40 - it on here
73:41 - the way that that works guys it's very
73:43 - simple if i go to the head that css
73:47 - uh if i go to the header here what where
73:50 - is our header well it's very
73:51 - simple it's the header search which is
73:54 - right here a header search cont no
73:57 - header search
73:58 - okay to add that i want you to
74:01 - look at this okay this is really cool
74:03 - really cool let me go and find it where
74:05 - where i usually have it but because okay
74:08 - so the way this works is the following i
74:11 - do focus within look at this
74:14 - i can do focus within so here
74:17 - on the header search i say focus with a
74:21 - mini if i
74:22 - anything that's on focus on the inside
74:24 - of it i will do
74:25 - the following i will do box shadow look
74:28 - at this guys
74:29 - a box shadow boom right there
74:32 - nope this is focused it's cool right
74:34 - it's so cool
74:35 - all right i'm also going to give it a
74:37 - background color of white let's see a
74:39 - background color of white
74:40 - okay back
74:44 - ground around let's see background
74:47 - color of white

74:55 - i think that's pretty much it on the
74:56 - side of the actual you know
74:58 - input stuff and i'm going to also for
75:01 - the border now that's good
75:02 - all right so let's go ahead and save
75:04 - that all right oh look at that
75:07 - look at this that looks so good
75:10 - and now and then you see how there's
75:12 - this weird
75:13 - thing going on with this border and i'm
75:15 - like oh my god i don't get it
75:17 - but that's okay because it all it's it's
75:19 - a very simple fix i go to here header
75:21 - search input

77:19 - portion right so we need to be able to
77:20 - get add this specific portion right here
77:24 - and then we'll add the card what i want
77:26 - to do now is the following
77:28 - let's add the actual cart you'll see
77:31 - why in a second okay so
77:35 - um on the card section let's take a look
77:38 - at this all right
77:39 - now how do we actually do that
77:43 - right how do we go ahead and have a cart
77:46 - that's going to work
77:47 - with us that's a good question well the
77:50 - following if i go to
77:51 - my app.js okay my header is there
77:54 - i can also add a card so i'm going to
77:56 - create a card component i will do a new
77:58 - file and i will say card.js this is
78:00 - going to be our cart page guys card.js
78:02 - okay
78:03 - oh i'll do rfce and rcv
78:06 - rfc is just an extension guys for you to
78:10 - be able to
78:10 - have shortcuts if you don't have the
78:12 - shortcut there's no problem to install
78:14 - the shortcut you have to go to
78:15 - extensions and do es7
78:17 - react redux right here react redux uh
78:20 - uh what is what it's called components
78:22 - is what i shall call it right yeah
78:24 - actually if you type in es7 it's going
78:26 - this is going to be the first one to
78:27 - shoot react without
78:29 - you uh snippet something there awesome
78:32 - sweet
78:32 - all right what did i just do whatever
78:33 - happened okay there we go good
78:35 - job let's go back to the gs header
78:38 - no contain the header can you can it can
78:40 - you have that good good good i like it
78:43 - all right okay next up i'm going to add
78:45 - the card so i'm going to say cart
78:47 - as well in here david
78:50 - damn it no i'm i'm not even
78:54 - touching it that's so interesting okay
78:55 - good and then what's going to happen is
78:56 - i'm going to import the card so you have
78:58 - this card right here i'm going to save
78:59 - this card
79:00 - go up the gs i'm going to import this
79:02 - card so import
79:04 - cart from
79:08 - damn it no come on
79:12 - good good good good good nice
79:16 - and now we have the card now we don't
79:17 - see anything but that's okay
79:19 - i'll go to cut that gs i'm saying
79:24 - all right there so this is the card now
79:27 - but
79:28 - the question is now how to differentiate
79:30 - this from the home page
79:32 - well it's a few very different things
79:34 - okay we're going to use something
79:36 - called your router i'm going to create
79:37 - another page called home so let's go to
79:39 - source
79:41 - source new file and we'll go ahead and
79:43 - say home.gs right there
79:45 - okay i'm the gs and do rfce
79:48 - good that's going to create the home one
79:51 - and i'm gonna say this is home
79:53 - good let's go back to app.gs awesome
79:56 - and we'll also do home
80:00 - so almost undefined it's gonna import
80:03 - say import
80:05 - home from what from
80:09 - home right there good nice so now we
80:12 - have two pages we have the card page
80:14 - and we also have the home page now how
80:18 - do we
80:18 - if i click on one how do i get to the
80:20 - other one that's going to be a good
80:22 - question well
80:23 - we're going to use something called
80:24 - react router down guys
80:26 - react router dom right there
80:29 - not dom dom
80:33 - right there so in react writer down will
80:35 - allow us to be able to navigate between
80:38 - pages kind of like when you have for
80:39 - example you know facebook you have a
80:41 - news feed page
80:42 - and then you have for example netflix
80:44 - you have you know a page where you have
80:45 - all your movies and then you have a page
80:47 - where you have all the you know an
80:49 - individual movie and so forth well
80:50 - this will allow us to do that and
80:56 - i'm sorry i already loaded it i already
81:00 - typed it in
81:00 - in the terminal thank you so let's go
81:02 - ahead and hold up the terminal
81:04 - how do i do how do i open into a
81:05 - terminal let me see
81:07 - command j let me see sh is it the one
81:11 - right there so you can see dave is going
81:12 - to type it in right there
81:14 - npmi react router dumb let's go to
81:17 - install it
81:18 - beautiful it's basically just
81:22 - and it's actually switching between
81:25 - pages without
81:26 - loading or reloading so you know with
81:28 - normal pages
81:30 - when you click a link it's going to like
81:32 - go super slow and it's just
81:34 - loading and stuff this case boom
81:37 - you're there exactly exactly so the way
81:40 - it works is very simple this for example
81:42 - right here is a link so you can link to
81:44 - different pages
81:45 - and this is the actual route we have a
81:47 - switch and there's we have a route for
81:49 - the about page
81:50 - a route for the users page right and so
81:52 - forth and so forth let me
81:54 - put this up for you so you guys can see
81:55 - it better okay
81:57 - right there right there so we'll do the
81:59 - same thing in our situation as well i'm
82:01 - going to make this just a tad smaller
82:03 - it's a bit too big
82:04 - all right good so in our case here's
82:06 - what we'll do
82:07 - we'll have the header which is always
82:08 - going to be here because the header is
82:09 - something in common
82:11 - that both the about on to the card page
82:14 - and the home page have
82:15 - so what we will do is i will i will now
82:17 - import react router
82:19 - react router dom i will say import
82:22 - here i'm going to say import and check
82:25 - this out guys pay a close
82:27 - attention okay we'll do right here
82:30 - import browser router as router that's
82:32 - the first i'm going to import so i'm
82:33 - going to say
82:36 - boom browser router as router comma
82:39 - switch
82:41 - comma what route
82:44 - comma what link where we import this
82:48 - from
82:50 - from react boom
82:54 - router dash dumb done
82:57 - done so okay kaput
83:01 - good now good mo
83:04 - all right so we're going to follow the
83:05 - same path as they are showing us here
83:07 - which is a switch with
83:08 - with the route okay we're going to
83:09 - follow the same path i will go ahead and
83:11 - do like this we'll say
83:12 - so we'll say switch initially that's
83:15 - correct but before you do that
83:17 - you just have to put the whole thing in
83:19 - a router
83:20 - oh [ __ ] you're right my bad my bad my
83:22 - bad sorry that's all right i got you bro
83:25 - you got me so you have to put the whole
83:26 - thing in the router because you can see
83:27 - here
83:28 - this right here is router right there so
83:30 - good this thank you so much
83:32 - so router good and then we'll do switch
83:34 - case and that's it and then
83:36 - this will now have different routes
83:38 - we'll have one route for the cart so
83:39 - we'll say
83:40 - route here route
83:44 - and the path for this one's gonna be
83:46 - path is gonna be
83:49 - dash cart okay and this will have the
83:52 - card page so we'll say the card
83:53 - component some say cart
83:56 - boom right there the next route is gonna
83:58 - be which one
84:01 - next route is going to be nothing
84:04 - the home page right there's the homepage
84:06 - then there's the cart page
84:07 - and this will have the actual home page
84:10 - i like to call it
84:12 - so home boom boom that's the one
84:15 - okay remove all this stuff and boom
84:18 - shakalaka we got it
84:21 - okay i just do a little bit of spacing
84:23 - good and i want to add that
84:25 - that you always want to make sure that
84:27 - the last one
84:29 - in this case like in a switch like this
84:32 - is
84:32 - always the slash because that's pretty
84:34 - much the full uh the fall back off
84:36 - that's the fallback okay
84:38 - meaning if nothing else works if for
84:39 - example let's say you type in dash about
84:41 - and the route is not there it will go to
84:43 - the homepage so what is the helper
84:44 - somebody asked the homepage guys is this
84:46 - page guys this is the homepage right
84:48 - here
84:48 - the homepage is this page the cart page
84:52 - is this page okay and so we've got how
84:54 - to create those two pages
84:55 - understood comprende comprende good
84:59 - all right comprende comprende awesome
85:03 - so look at this now you see currently
85:05 - we're on the homepage because that's the
85:06 - default page as you can see right
85:07 - only shows home but if i type in cart
85:11 - if i type in cart check this out
85:15 - yeah boom it has the card page now you
85:18 - see that right there
85:20 - it has the clicker page exactly and i
85:22 - can actually now
85:23 - link it i can link the card page to when
85:26 - i go ahead and actually
85:27 - click on the card right here
85:30 - let's go ahead and do that right now
85:32 - right now so i go ahead and go click on
85:33 - the cart
85:34 - where's my card my card is right here
85:37 - my card is where where's my my link my

85:49 - course the first thing we want to go
85:50 - ahead and do
85:50 - okay you got it okay so let's go ahead
85:53 - and import the link
85:55 - nice the only one we're going to use is
85:57 - just simply the link one we don't need
85:58 - to use this one at this portion at all
86:00 - just the link from three backfire down
86:02 - and then what we will go ahead and do
86:04 - we'll do

86:32 - so now we just yeah what's up
86:36 - so why okay it's good
86:40 - don't worry we'll fix this so check this
86:42 - out okay this the reason why it looks
86:44 - hideous is the following because when
86:46 - you do a link to a cart
86:48 - it's going to put an a tag you see we
86:50 - before we had an a
86:51 - a div now it's a whole a tag which is
86:53 - completely fine okay
86:55 - all we got to do is for the attack now
86:56 - do display flex and then
86:58 - all we got to do is make it vertically
86:59 - aligned so let's go to
87:04 - actually maybe let's do it this way i'm
87:07 - gonna do a little bit smarter here so
87:08 - i'm gonna say you can link to here
87:10 - i'm gonna say boom link to inside here
87:14 - i'm do it this way okay i think it'll be
87:16 - a lot easier for us this way
87:18 - i think that will still be oh
87:22 - okay good nice good nice
87:26 - nice nice that's a little bit better now
87:27 - it's a little bit better it's not as bad
87:29 - as it was well used to be
87:30 - before but what we do now is on the a so
87:33 - we'll do header option card let's go to
87:35 - header option card which is below
87:36 - somewhere here
87:38 - or is it header option card okay i will
87:41 - say
87:41 - e and then uh here i will say
87:45 - everything display flex
87:50 - boom oh oh you see you didn't believe me
87:55 - i didn't no i did i just didn't know
87:57 - what what your goal was boom
88:00 - look at that okay let's go ahead and do
88:02 - at this point the following
88:05 - we'll do color white for this one so we
88:07 - have to change the color
88:10 - okay right there and again the reason
88:12 - why um what just happened here
88:18 - no use for display flag
88:22 - yeah this one bro display flex
88:26 - now display flex still needs to be on
88:28 - here good
88:30 - good you see right there so the reason
88:32 - why we have to change the color on here
88:33 - guys is because by default the a tag has
88:36 - a weird color i have no idea why
88:39 - but it does okay so what they follow the
88:41 - a tag which is a link tag has that
88:43 - has a really work out so we did remove
88:45 - that and also
88:46 - for that we need to remove the text
88:48 - decoration so say text decoration
88:50 - and the text equation is this underline
88:52 - right here you can see right there you
88:53 - see
88:54 - that's the text decoration right there
88:56 - so do text dash
88:57 - decoration ratio and this could be none
89:03 - bomb voila look at that now look at this
89:06 - if i now go to the home page
89:10 - boom home page if i click on the cart
89:13 - boom we're on the cart page how cool is
89:15 - that huh
89:36 - wait that's not me there we go

92:09 - a few things let's convert this to a
92:11 - container
92:13 - container because we're going to use
92:14 - components as always
92:16 - container yeah while you do that i'm
92:18 - just going to be importing the solder
92:20 - component
92:21 - silently so here's important to style
92:22 - the components right and
92:24 - right there beautiful so container
92:26 - container container awesome
92:27 - save this uh for some reasons give
92:30 - yelling me for some reason
92:32 - what are you doing let's let's redo the
92:35 - whole thing

92:48 - go we'll be good it'll be good
92:49 - hi all right
92:56 - yeah okay no container that's fine
93:01 - div i likes nothing
93:04 - ah that's fine rfc is the new way what
93:07 - i'm saying like we are at the very
93:08 - beginning of the
93:09 - okay
93:14 - i think he has to start with some of the
93:15 - use code honestly
93:17 - there you go microsoft product yeah
93:20 - oh come on bro no i didn't say anything
93:25 - all right so cool so let's go into const
93:27 - container let's go ahead and create the
93:28 - style component guys
93:29 - you could do style.div okay okay
93:32 - good good good good nice stella there
93:35 - again this is a component guys okay
93:37 - and this container is gonna not don't
93:38 - worry about that yes so much but
93:40 - this will have two things one is gonna
93:41 - be the home banner
93:43 - right there so let's go ahead and do a
93:45 - one for a home
93:46 - banner okay so we'll say home
93:50 - actually just do banner so do banner
93:52 - like this
93:53 - okay let's give you the banner and then
93:55 - the last one is going to be
93:57 - the content okay that's going to be the
94:00 - content of the home so the content is
94:02 - going to be actually what
94:03 - it's going to be these portions so
94:05 - anything that's in here
94:07 - and that is considered something like
94:09 - content understood
94:10 - comprende good so i'm going to say
94:12 - content underneath this one
94:14 - good oh
94:18 - look at this that looks so cool i'm not
94:21 - sure what is that what that is but
94:22 - that's okay
94:23 - so content now the banner is gonna be
94:25 - very simple guys we need to make that
94:27 - banner into a much better form all right
94:30 - so for the banner well the banner you
94:32 - can see it has a background image
94:34 - and let's take a look at how do we
94:35 - actually do it if i go ahead and go to
94:37 - the banner and i do style.div
94:39 - let's see i'm going to say background
94:41 - image
94:43 - background image is something i'm not
94:46 - really sure what
94:47 - but it's going to be this portion right
94:49 - here so let me see
94:50 - style background image it's going to be
94:52 - this url which i have provided for you
94:54 - right there
94:55 - beautiful right there okay let's go and
94:59 - save this good good good good
95:00 - i can you gonna copy this and paste it
95:02 - in for for everybody to see of course
95:05 - god beautiful
95:08 - good good good nice nice nice background
95:11 - image good so that's gonna be the
95:12 - background image of this specific
95:14 - content
95:14 - and let's also now go ahead and give
95:16 - this one a uh you know we need to give
95:18 - it a minimum height so i'm going to say
95:20 - minimum height
95:22 - so min height
95:25 - min height of 600 pixels
95:29 - david can you not highlight this please
95:33 - david you're not highlighting highlight
95:35 - yeah don't highlight it good thank you
95:36 - all right mini height and then let's see
95:39 - what happens now if i go ahead and go to
95:40 - helm banner let's see what happens now
95:42 - container is not refined well because
95:45 - it's not contains container
95:47 - there we go god god that's a typo i know
95:50 - it's fine
95:51 - we all have typos it's okay not the end
95:53 - of the world it's all good
95:55 - it's all good right so
95:58 - nothing's going on so far right you have
96:00 - many height of 600 pixels
96:01 - but because of what it actually
96:03 - shouldn't be in the content it should be
96:05 - where guys hopefully got that it should
96:06 - be on the banner
96:09 - that was a test for you not for me
96:13 - i didn't even realize i failed that test
96:17 - oh that's funny right we also made this
96:19 - background image in a bad way
96:21 - this should be url like so okay
96:25 - god and so we're gonna put that ah short
96:29 - url i'm gonna give it like this
96:32 - bomb right there god
96:36 - nice look at that beautiful so we've got
96:39 - something along the lines 743 likes holy
96:42 - [ __ ] guys
96:42 - can we get to a thousand let's put let's
96:46 - say that let's do it to a thousand
96:48 - thousand i mean we have 335 people live
96:52 - so if
96:52 - everybody smashes in we should be good
96:55 - if everybody smash that like button like
96:56 - crazy that would be great
96:57 - so yeah main height of oh look at this
96:59 - 600 pixels look at that it's looking
97:00 - starting to look so so much better
97:02 - one thing i want to fix now is the
97:03 - following is the positioning of this
97:05 - background as you can see it's way too
97:07 - big
97:08 - right it's way too big not something i
97:10 - will like like to use right
97:12 - well that's why david here is doing
97:14 - background position position
97:16 - right there that's centered that's gonna
97:18 - center it right there it's gonna center
97:20 - it
97:20 - horizontally and then he's gonna do
97:22 - background size
97:24 - cover now what does that mean let's go
97:27 - into so it's
97:28 - super uh super quickly background
97:31 - position
97:32 - is the position of the background so if
97:34 - it's center
97:35 - basically it makes sure that the
97:36 - background images center is going to be
97:39 - centered god god god god good now
97:42 - here is the cool part okay now listen up
97:45 - all right how do we go ahead right we've
97:48 - got this portion look at that i mean it
97:50 - looks pretty cool it's centered right
97:51 - it's all amazing right no problem
97:53 - whatsoever yeah the cover
97:54 - we didn't explain the cover we'll cover
97:57 - oh yes the cover thank you so much
97:59 - cover it's just make sure that it adapts
98:02 - no matter how big
98:03 - the window of the browser is it's going
98:06 - to be the
98:07 - it's going to like fill out the whole
98:08 - thing yeah so if i go back outside cover
98:11 - right there only give you just a few
98:13 - different uh
98:14 - ways you see so there's contain that
98:16 - there's cover
98:17 - which cover basically will take up as
98:19 - much space as it needs
98:21 - as it possibly can to fill up the whole
98:22 - diff so cover basically will
98:24 - always always fill up the div that's the
98:27 - big difference
98:28 - then we have back on contain that's
98:30 - going to basically make sure that the
98:31 - height
98:32 - because can and the width is contained
98:33 - within that div as well right so that's
98:35 - contained right there all right
98:37 - and that's pretty much the big
98:38 - difference honestly now
98:40 - now here's a question for you you see
98:42 - how we have this like um
98:44 - what's it called this you see how behind
98:47 - this there's like a
98:48 - it's a gradient how do we do that man
98:52 - we need to introduce something called
98:54 - linear
98:55 - gradient now that's actually not
98:57 - something
98:59 - uh that's super easy to type out but in
99:01 - this case we can actually do that
99:03 - yeah so look at this i mean i'm gonna
99:05 - copy paste this actually so
99:06 - they can see it so it's um i don't wanna
99:09 - i wanna confuse you guys too much but
99:10 - it's a linear gradient that's going to
99:12 - go from top to bottom
99:13 - and it's going to go look at this it's
99:15 - going to go from right here from black
99:18 - to white you see from black
99:22 - to well no this is still from um
99:25 - from fully black right here right there
99:28 - oh
99:28 - yeah no no fully black with zero opacity
99:32 - you see with zero opacity basically and
99:34 - what we're doing
99:35 - is we're masking the image and when you
99:37 - mask the image
99:39 - the black portion becomes transparent
99:42 - okay that's how that's the way that
99:43 - works and so if i go ahead and
99:45 - save this guys take a look at this if i
99:47 - say this
99:48 - boom right there this is what we have
99:52 - you see now look at this without this
99:57 - boom with this
100:00 - boom donezo
100:04 - done wow how cool is that guys what do
100:06 - you guys think huh
100:08 - what do you guys think that is pretty i
100:11 - would say that's pretty insane i will
100:12 - say i'll
100:13 - say i like that a lot so look at that
100:15 - what do you guys think let me know
100:16 - oh let me see who linear gradient
100:19 - beautiful
100:20 - rgba amazing somebody's saying your ass
100:23 - smash that thumbs up guys yes you guys
100:25 - know it of course
100:26 - always always hell yeah
100:30 - thumbs up beautiful all right awesome
100:32 - let's go continue on
100:38 - all right so we got that portion now
100:40 - it's going to work on the content
100:42 - section which is going to be
100:43 - the those product divs okay the content
100:46 - is actually going to be this section
100:47 - let's just for now let's make the
100:49 - section for example just background
100:50 - background white for now background
100:56 - white background white
100:59 - all right let's go and save this okay
101:02 - nothing so far okay
101:04 - back on why because why the content
101:05 - literally has nothing inside so i'm
101:07 - gonna say i'm gonna say
101:11 - [Laughter]
101:14 - don't judge all right no i don't
101:18 - no no i just be myself i know i know
101:22 - no for the background white if you look
101:24 - at our actual clone as you can see
101:26 - you see there's one number first thing
101:27 - is you will do is you see there's
101:29 - there's some padding as well and there's
101:32 - a max
101:32 - width to where it goes you see this
101:34 - right here there's a max width
101:35 - um so here's how we kind of want to go
101:38 - ahead and do it
101:38 - for the content section here's what's
101:41 - going to happen well
101:43 - number one the container for this
101:46 - container we're going to give the max
101:47 - width so for this container let's do max
101:51 - width width
101:56 - max width of what or 1500 pixels
102:00 - look right to the south now what does
102:02 - this mean if i go ahead and go to here
102:05 - you see you see that's a max without a
102:08 - 500 or
102:09 - 1500 pixels but but check this out
102:12 - you see how do we now center this image
102:13 - this whole container i want it to be
102:15 - centered in the middle
102:16 - so that it's kind of like right here now
102:19 - we can do that use something called
102:20 - margin zero auto okay if i do this
102:24 - boom okay if i do margin
102:28 - margin right here now if i zero auto
102:32 - okay now watch this watch this watch
102:35 - remember before
102:36 - watch this boom right there now we have
102:39 - ourselves
102:40 - a fully centered div that's called
102:42 - margin zero auto okay just so you guys
102:44 - understand
102:45 - beautiful and now with that said what
102:48 - now let's think about what we're going
102:49 - to do
102:51 - for the content the content is now here
102:53 - which is beautiful it's amazing
102:55 - okay i'm going to for the content i'm
102:57 - going to give it a padding so i'm going
102:58 - to say padding left
103:00 - pending left of 10 pixels
103:03 - and i will say padding right
103:07 - of 10 pixels as well boom so i just
103:10 - pushed this to the
103:11 - this side okay now big problem here
103:15 - big problemo how do we move it up how do
103:18 - we move these products up that's a good
103:19 - question what do you think david
103:22 - what do you think i would say margin
103:24 - margin minus something
103:26 - so so check this out this is really cool
103:28 - i want you guys
103:29 - i want you guys to pay attention really
103:31 - closely here okay while i'll take a sip
103:32 - of water
103:34 - [Laughter]
103:36 - oh yeah hydration don't pay attention to
103:38 - me pay attention to the code
103:40 - all right so look at this um one really
103:44 - cool thing with margin
103:46 - all right so are you listening let me
103:49 - know in the comments you're listening
103:50 - check this out if i have for example
103:52 - margin here
103:54 - let's say this is this is the content
103:55 - okay
103:57 - now margin pushes it up so for example
103:59 - margin up let's say six pixels
104:02 - right it's gonna push this what this
104:04 - container down correct
104:06 - this whole container is going to go down
104:07 - yes or no correct if i do margin top six
104:10 - pistols yes or no
104:12 - but here's my question what if i do
104:15 - margin
104:16 - top minus six pixels
104:21 - the opposite what if i do that
104:25 - and it's gonna be negative margin so
104:27 - look instead of pushing
104:28 - basically instead of pushing it down
104:31 - instead of creating space
104:33 - here it's actually going to push it
104:36 - up so margin top minus six pistol is
104:40 - basically like
104:42 - it's basically like for example taking
104:44 - this container right here taking this
104:45 - container boom
104:46 - and literally moving this container this
104:49 - whole container
104:50 - this whole container i'll put a circle
104:52 - up with minus
104:54 - six pixels right so what is the issue
104:57 - right now the issue is very simple well
105:00 - the issue right now is that we have this
105:03 - thing which is all the way here
105:05 - now how do we move it up so that it is
105:09 - where
105:11 - right here it should be right yeah
105:14 - what do we do tell me what do we do tell
105:17 - me huh
105:18 - well that is what we do yeah what we can
105:20 - do is we can do margin top
105:23 - margin top guys yeah
105:27 - and i would say 350 pixels in negative
105:30 - margin this top minus 350
105:35 - pixels boom shakalaka we got this
105:38 - [Laughter]
105:42 - a margin margin
105:45 - hey look at that you see that right
105:47 - there
105:48 - margin top right there
105:52 - that's all honestly we needed that's
105:54 - pretty much
105:55 - it how cool is that what do you think
105:59 - i think that's pretty cool huh i think
106:01 - it's pretty super cool yeah i think it's
106:02 - pretty cool i love it
106:03 - right so that's pretty awesome so now we
106:06 - have what's up
106:07 - let me just ask you this because uh it
106:10 - just came into my mind too
106:11 - somebody in the comment whole dot asks
106:14 - uh what if
106:14 - what about position absolute what's your
106:17 - take on that
106:18 - so position absolute is not something
106:20 - you want to use you
106:21 - try not to install it on in any case
106:25 - position of salute is going to position
106:27 - it like directly there
106:29 - um it's a people don't use it
106:33 - you are not going to be able to scroll
106:35 - because you won't be able to scroll
106:36 - exactly
106:38 - well no technically you still be able to
106:39 - scroll it's fine but the position of
106:41 - silhouette is
106:41 - if you make a relative to that
106:43 - specification item i highly recommend
106:45 - you don't do something like that
106:46 - it takes it it takes the whole thing out
106:47 - of context so for example let's say
106:49 - there's a
106:50 - you know you know there's imagine this
106:53 - if you have pages right it goes one page
106:56 - after the other page right
106:58 - if you do position absolute it's the
106:59 - same thing as
107:01 - taking this page ripping it out
107:04 - oh [ __ ] hold on rip it
107:07 - ripping out the page and then absolutely
107:10 - position it
107:11 - come on absolutely position it anywhere
107:14 - you want
107:15 - okay that's called position absolute so
107:17 - let's say absolute top
107:19 - you see it's lost absolute position
107:22 - has lost its context where it actually
107:25 - is if you
107:25 - move the pat notepad the that single
107:28 - piece of paper is not going to move but
107:30 - exactly exactly so that's what you guys
107:32 - need to understand you want to use it
107:33 - use it as less
107:35 - as possible was that a pretty cool
107:36 - explanation to you guys i think so too
107:39 - [Laughter]
107:42 - so i said absolute is bad for your
107:44 - health
107:47 - yeah so i would recommend you guys not
107:49 - do that okay
107:51 - now what's gonna happen now is let's go
107:53 - how much do we have we have about
107:55 - 10 minutes that's just fine that's fine
107:57 - so we got that portion
107:58 - the next thing on a portion is let's go
108:00 - ahead and actually go ahead and create
108:02 - the product

109:04 - that is amazing that is what i think
109:06 - it's production already bro
109:08 - i i really i really did pretty much
109:10 - professionally it's pretty much i would
109:11 - say so
109:12 - i would say so all right so sweet
109:15 - so look we got that portion now let's go
109:17 - ahead back to our amazon logo
109:19 - let's create in our product page so so
109:21 - if we think about this okay
109:23 - we have a few things now well what do we
109:25 - have we have this right here we have
109:27 - this right and we have this correct
109:30 - mundo yes we do all right so the next
109:33 - thing to do is we need to now
109:35 - create what a product
109:38 - okay a product now a product here
109:41 - is in multiple rows right we have this
109:43 - is one row
109:45 - right here and then we have three
109:47 - products in
109:48 - this row correct mundo
109:51 - yes indeed so let's actually work on
109:54 - that
109:55 - we're calling in the home page okay
109:57 - we're calling the home page
109:59 - i want us to create two products okay
110:01 - let's think about this now
110:03 - if i'm on the home page okay on the
110:05 - content page
110:06 - all right let's now create what what do
110:10 - you guys think let's create the product

111:38 - going to say product here
111:40 - product product
111:44 - boom done probably fine
111:47 - perfect product not defined because i
111:49 - probably wrong good
111:51 - all right so producto is right there
111:52 - awesome now producto is going to have a
111:55 - few different things
111:56 - it's going to have a container here okay
111:59 - good because it's going to do style
112:01 - components so we'll say here
112:03 - import what are we importing david
112:06 - uh you need to be importing the style
112:08 - from styled components
112:12 - [Music]
112:14 - what did you do bro i don't know didn't
112:16 - like me
112:17 - [Laughter]
112:20 - from i got this
112:23 - styled dash
112:26 - components equals components okay good
112:30 - good good good good good so
112:31 - save that let's refresh this
112:35 - containers are defined perfect because
112:37 - why you do const container
112:41 - and you can see guys as i'm going
112:43 - through this stuff right
112:44 - i'm always able to solve the problem
112:47 - very pretty much simply just by kind of
112:49 - going one by one
112:50 - one step at a time as part of coding
112:53 - you're doing things
112:54 - one step at a time that's one thing when
112:55 - i'll make sure you guys understand we'll
112:57 - do background color here
113:02 - color let's do background color we're
113:04 - going to say white
113:06 - correct white
113:10 - but come on somebody came in
113:14 - with russian what that's what it could
113:16 - be that's fine
113:17 - what do you mean ukrainian and russian
113:18 - is fine where but you move
113:20 - no no i was just checking if anybody
113:24 - speaks spanish i mean
113:25 - somebody said johan says johanna say why
113:28 - don't you guys respond guys i mean we're
113:29 - trying to respond we're also coding
113:30 - you know we got 10 things at the same
113:31 - time you know it's really hard to code
113:33 - and respond at the same time guys all
113:35 - right
113:36 - somebody said are we building the back
113:37 - end no we are building the front end
113:39 - guys okay something no hablo espanol
113:41 - that's funny
113:44 - product wow wow
113:47 - so are we also creating the back end
113:48 - that could support a multi-vendor
113:50 - marketplace or is it just a front
113:51 - so we're doing the front end right now
113:53 - so we're doing the front right now
113:55 - and then we'll have a back end side of
113:56 - things where we'll be able to connect
113:57 - this with a database okay that's what
113:59 - we're working on guys just so you know
114:00 - all right so get the background color
114:02 - white
114:03 - might did i say background color white
114:04 - correct by the way did it right
114:08 - okay uh yeah i think so now the reason
114:11 - why
114:11 - the background color white on the
114:12 - container is not showing up is
114:14 - well a few very simple things let me go
114:16 - ahead and inspect down with them this
114:17 - morning
114:18 - do we even initialize that
114:22 - yeah we did don't worry about it you did
114:24 - okay so let's go ahead and inspect them
114:25 - on this one
114:27 - yeah where is it
114:31 - right there's a product right there
114:35 - good good good good now this product has
114:37 - a background color what exactly
114:39 - now check this out if i do see index
114:45 - how do i do a hundred okay maybe i gotta
114:47 - do z
114:48 - what's up what'd you say
114:52 - i said something magical is happening
114:54 - what is magic what's happening
114:55 - i mean you're covering the the whole
114:58 - thing that that
114:59 - that's happening so so look guys
115:03 - you can see right now we have see text
115:05 - and it's kind of like see-through it's
115:06 - transparent is that correct
115:08 - that's right right so the issue that's
115:10 - going on right now is this this linear
115:12 - gradient color thing the bob
115:14 - is preventing a lot of things from
115:16 - happening which is very unfortunate
115:18 - because i don't like it because well i
115:21 - mean you'll see why in a second here but
115:23 - what i want to do is for the product
115:25 - number one i'm going to make this
115:26 - product a z-index
115:28 - c index of a hundred
115:32 - okay good okay that's fine
115:36 - and then i'm going to go to for example
115:38 - home.js
115:40 - i'm going to make this i'm going to
115:41 - remove this i don't need this anymore
115:44 - all right okay that's the content here
115:48 - and this will also be the content will
115:50 - also be what
115:52 - a z index of 100
115:57 - pixels okay it's still not working the
116:00 - way i want to be but now look at this if
116:02 - i go to the banner
116:03 - and i see z index you don't have to have
116:07 - to
116:12 - pick
116:14 - not something i wanted to uh wait wait
116:16 - wait wait wait
116:17 - you you made the typo i just fixed it i
116:19 - got you bro yeah
116:20 - but it's still not the way i want it to
116:22 - be look at this the index of minus one
116:23 - you see that right
116:24 - you see i think no no i think you want
116:26 - to have one
116:28 - instead of uh z index boom and and you
116:31 - have you have to have one
116:33 - because the hundred is above one so it's
116:35 - going to be above anyway
116:36 - you're just being explicit about it okay
116:39 - so like you see it's still kind of not
116:42 - there to where i want it to be because
116:44 - the content is not still
116:45 - still not background color white what do
116:47 - we do in that case
116:48 - what do you think um i mean
116:51 - can you actually like point on the
116:53 - screen with the
116:55 - pointer yeah like where is the product
116:59 - because i still
117:00 - product is here this is the product okay
117:02 - there's a product right there
117:03 - okay right what we're trying to do is
117:05 - we're trying crea creating a div or
117:07 - trying to create a div
117:08 - right here and that's kind of the hard
117:10 - part that we're working somebody said
117:12 - put the index of one we did we put the
117:15 - index of one right
117:16 - here good let me see z index
117:19 - there was a some some thing that i had
117:21 - to do i forgot
117:22 - what did i do before to make this let me
117:24 - see what can we do in that case
117:26 - what can we do to fix this product to
117:28 - have an actual background color white
117:29 - because
117:30 - the problem right now is that this
117:32 - product is hidden
117:34 - wait what just do i just changed the
117:37 - background color to blue from
117:38 - white and it's for some reason it's now
117:41 - working but if i change it back to white
117:45 - uh wait what
117:50 - let me think let me think so banner is
117:52 - the index of one
117:57 - so product content let me see what did i
118:00 - do on here potentially embassy because i
118:02 - always have it in different situations
118:03 - too so
118:05 - um a thing has to do potentially with
118:10 - let's see max height so product what do
118:13 - you guys what do you guys think huh
118:15 - what do you guys think
118:18 - let me see use hex values this is the
118:21 - order only figure out with white bro
118:23 - try z x one z index two you didn't
118:25 - specify the size or two container and
118:27 - product component okay
118:28 - so let's try this so let's go ahead and
118:30 - do the product.gs let's do the size
118:32 - let's do width for example
118:36 - let's do the width on this one of like
118:38 - 300 200 pixels
118:41 - and let's do height
118:44 - also 300 pixels
118:48 - i think now you see the gradient
118:51 - what because the gradient has also been
118:53 - applied to this image too that's why
118:55 - so this is the okay huh
118:58 - okay that's just how it works don't
119:00 - worry about it
119:02 - so look let's see let's take a look at
119:04 - this and don't worry we'll figure it out
119:06 - let's see background color white that's
119:07 - fine i think it's partially because
119:10 - let me see if i go ahead and if i save
119:12 - this let's go to home.gs
119:14 - no it's still not it it's not what i
119:15 - wanted to do so z
119:17 - index of 100 that's fine
119:20 - maybe needs to be display flex what if i
119:22 - do display flex on it let me see
119:24 - if i do the banner
119:28 - whatever display flex on the content
119:31 - play
119:32 - flex oh look at that
119:39 - wait what oh that's
119:42 - funny oh that's funny
119:45 - oh man you just put a display flex in
119:48 - the content and it solved it
119:50 - yeah yeah yeah yeah i don't know why
119:56 - that's a big issue a lot of developers
119:57 - have like i don't know why guys
120:00 - i mean i kind of understand why what do
120:02 - you guys think why
120:03 - that's the case what do you think huh
120:05 - producto why did all of a sudden become
120:07 - that because
120:07 - the issue before this was the fact that
120:10 - basically producto was part of the mask
120:13 - right so it was being masked as well the
120:16 - second i put display flex though
120:19 - what if i do display block
120:23 - no display inline block
120:29 - no uh display flex i guess is the only
120:33 - option
120:34 - okay so that's a bit odd
120:37 - so i know right that's a little odd but
120:39 - that's fine
120:41 - it's really fun so the reason why it's
120:43 - like this actually is pretty fairly
120:45 - fairly simple guys
120:46 - check this out right i think it's it's
120:49 - because
120:50 - what jasmine goes in the comments
120:52 - because display flex fixes everything
120:54 - [Laughter]
120:58 - exactly
120:58 - [Laughter]
121:01 - exactly exactly
121:05 - oh guys somebody said guys
121:08 - if you have a problem just type display
121:10 - flex
121:14 - oh my god it's some sort of magic stuff
121:17 - position relative
121:18 - that could have been good you only said
121:19 - flex is a you only said flex is a must
121:24 - but granted look is the enix is still
121:26 - still important if i remove this this
121:28 - this won't work fully
121:30 - oh will it let me see content
121:33 - oh [ __ ] this i guess venus is not does
121:34 - not even matter here too much
121:36 - let me see so content hold on hold on so
121:38 - that's good so the index of one
121:39 - on this one i think because it creates
121:41 - it makes the content to be
121:43 - um like its own container i think that's
121:45 - why let's not be part of it so
121:47 - hey i think
122:01 - but how cool is that huh
122:06 - hmm somebody says because when you say
122:09 - display flex the product
122:10 - product flexes its muscles and gets seen
122:13 - by people since it doesn't have chicken
122:14 - arms
122:16 - oh my gosh that's the funniest one i've
122:19 - heard so far
122:23 - oh my god that's funny because the
122:25 - flexes it's
122:26 - muscles guys that's why yeah flex is
122:28 - always a savior there we go
122:30 - so that's interesting so that worked
122:32 - okay so that's cool so look at this now
122:34 - we have one product
122:35 - now let's think about this so if we had
122:36 - display flex okay
122:38 - what if we have two products now okay
122:40 - can i can i
122:41 - let's say this let's see go to product
122:44 - gs producto
122:45 - let's make this forget the width
122:50 - forget the width okay instead what i'm
122:53 - going to do
122:54 - is let's do this producto and now we'll
122:57 - go ahead and go the home.gs file
122:59 - and let's edit one more product so we
123:01 - have two one
123:04 - product oh done
123:07 - oh we have product
123:11 - sorry thoughts
123:17 - now what do you guys think we need to do
123:19 - in order to go ahead and spread these
123:20 - out
123:21 - you know so that they take up the full
123:22 - width well
123:24 - that's very simple all i gotta do is go
123:26 - to product
123:27 - right and i say producto and i say what
123:30 - flex
123:31 - if i remove the xenix here will still
123:32 - work

127:47 - all right so add to cart
127:48 - is right here nice okay
127:52 - so we have the layout of the whole thing
127:54 - let's do this
127:55 - the title i'm gonna give it some
127:56 - placeholder data right the title
127:58 - one right there right there you see i'm
128:00 - gonna copy literally this whatever you
128:01 - wanna do let's do for example ipad pro
128:03 - i don't know whatever you wanna do so
128:05 - ipad pro price
128:06 - is 1449 we could put in here too no
128:09 - problem whatsoever
128:10 - again this is please hold data for now
128:12 - and then we'll be able to use the
128:14 - database to actually get data
128:15 - now reading here's the cool thing about
128:18 - the reading the way we can do it is the
128:19 - following we can literally just do stars
128:22 - boom right exactly there's actually you
128:24 - can actually just copy
128:26 - the star emoji and actually paste it in
128:28 - there and that's the emoji that i want
128:29 - to show you right there it's it's pretty
128:31 - pretty
128:31 - cool i will say that and then finally we
128:33 - have the image and this down image is
128:35 - going to have a source of the following
128:37 - and he will go ahead and copy and paste
128:39 - this for you guys so you guys have it as
128:41 - well
128:41 - and then you have the add to cart button
128:42 - now let's define these things
128:45 - underneath oh it's already been done
128:47 - never mind
128:50 - so the title is a styled p
128:53 - tag but actually i want it to be a style
128:56 - span tag not sp
128:57 - text pen okay and then
129:00 - for the price also style spin tag reason
129:04 - why i say span type because
129:05 - the p tag has a lot of uh styling that's
129:08 - automatically applied i don't want that
129:10 - that doesn't look so good i didn't
129:11 - know that it does it does then the
129:14 - product
129:14 - rating that's gonna be just a simple div
129:16 - then the aim is to be image add button
129:18 - is going to be a button now
129:19 - the button is going to have a few
129:20 - different things and we'll talk about
129:21 - that in a second here
129:23 - so now let's think about this the title
129:25 - now let's talk about the css of this
129:26 - stuff okay very important
129:28 - let's go and take a look at this what do
129:29 - we have so far
129:31 - oh [ __ ] what just happened oh look at
129:32 - this it works somehow wow that's cool it
129:35 - works guys look at this
129:36 - beautiful now of course it does i know i
129:39 - know i know and of course
129:40 - now so a few things for this thing okay
129:44 - one thing i want to do is make sure is
129:46 - let's go ahead and remove this
129:47 - min height instead i want to do is i
129:49 - want to add a max height for this
129:50 - actually let's do a max
129:52 - height for um should we do a max height
129:55 - what do you think
129:57 - yeah definitely i mean yeah let's do a
130:00 - match light
130:00 - big big screen yeah let's do a max
130:04 - height of 400 pixels on this one
130:06 - because it's too much max height or 400
130:10 - pixels
130:11 - because that will make maximum that will
130:13 - basically decrease the height of
130:14 - everything else which is good
130:16 - okay save that okay
130:19 - refresh it nothing's going to change so
130:21 - far so don't worry about that yeah okay
130:22 - that's gonna
130:22 - there's a reason why it's like this okay
130:24 - and then what's gonna happen the title
130:26 - uh let's do the following
130:30 - i think the title is fine let's go look
130:32 - at the price so the price is going to be
130:34 - the following
130:35 - so the price is going to be let's see
130:37 - font weight we're going to change the
130:39 - weight of this one
130:40 - to make it a little bit bolder so we'll
130:42 - say font weight of
130:43 - what 500. okay good make a little bit
130:47 - more
130:48 - price and then we'll do we'll do a few
130:50 - things in terms of like uh
130:52 - let's see font weight
130:55 - and then we'll give it a well nothing so
130:57 - far
130:58 - but check this out the price and the
131:01 - title
131:02 - you see how from the left from right
131:04 - well we need to actually make them
131:06 - from top to bottom so how do we go ahead
131:10 - and put the price from top to bottom
131:12 - or how do we put all these titles from
131:14 - top to bottom
131:15 - again display flags to the rescue

133:46 - i'm gonna make this smaller in that case
133:48 - with 100 pixels
133:51 - right and then what's going to happen is
133:53 - right there that's going to change the
133:54 - width of this button so let's go ahead
133:56 - if i go ahead and save this
133:59 - boom right now and then the background
134:00 - color is going to be this portion
134:02 - let's create this background color no
134:04 - problem
134:05 - okay now let's do the border for this
134:07 - specific thing okay
134:09 - let's do the border for this one so
134:10 - we'll do what good nice job
134:12 - so border two pixels solid and here
134:16 - this portion right here guys that's the
134:18 - width of the border
134:19 - that's the style of the border right
134:21 - here and this is the color of the border
134:22 - that's kind of how you do it right there
134:24 - okay guys good good good so if i go
134:26 - ahead and save this

134:31 - be what
134:33 - border radius of two pixels nice
134:38 - god god gotta go god go to god nice
134:41 - and what is it going to be i'm going to
134:43 - save that
134:44 - okay now we have a little bit of a
134:45 - circular button height of 30 pixels nice
134:49 - ah beautiful and look at that that looks
134:52 - so
134:53 - so so much better now we're not done yet
134:57 - how do you go ahead and center these now
134:59 - in a center because right now it's just
135:00 - like looks
135:01 - wonky right how do we stand this at the
135:04 - car button
135:05 - in the center what do you think huh
135:08 - what do you think i would just simply
135:12 - put like um
135:15 - use another div and then just put them
135:17 - in the center
135:19 - oh we can do it okay that's fine that's
135:22 - fine that's fine
135:23 - what i would honestly do is introduce
135:26 - a new div on the top here for the for
135:29 - all these details
135:31 - so those are not going to be centered
135:33 - but they are going to be aligned to the
135:34 - left
135:35 - okay that's fine everything is going to
135:37 - be centered
135:39 - good i like that or what we can do is
135:41 - very simple i can go to here check this
135:42 - out to decide i can do
135:44 - i can do this i can actually create
135:45 - different around here so i can do for
135:47 - example here
135:48 - i can i can say the action but action
135:52 - action uh section
135:55 - action section action section boom boom
135:58 - boom
136:00 - did you name it like that what's up
136:04 - action section the reason why we're
136:05 - creating this because look at this i
136:06 - want to be able to create another div
136:08 - that i can
136:09 - that can set so that it can go ahead and
136:11 - center everything in so
136:12 - action section look at this he's already
136:14 - creating action section div style.div
136:16 - and with this action section all i do is
136:18 - display flex okay display flags guys
136:21 - that's pretty much it and all i got to
136:23 - do is align no
136:24 - not just for content no not a lot items
136:26 - no no i don't i do both i do both
136:28 - fine okay you fancy pants okay that's
136:30 - fine
136:32 - and just if i can't descend it so what's
136:34 - gonna happen here is here's what we've
136:35 - done
136:36 - we created a container here called
136:38 - display flex
136:39 - and then what we did is we allowed it
136:41 - okay we allowed this div
136:43 - to be fully kind of centered vertically
136:45 - understood guys
136:46 - and this is why weed did that and so it
136:49 - makes things a lot a lot simpler for so
136:51 - many
136:51 - other reasons just so you guys know okay
136:55 - because that's good that's good we got
136:56 - the or or place items and that works
136:58 - that works too
136:59 - so now this is centered without the
137:02 - action section right here if we did
137:06 - place item center then the whole thing
137:08 - will be centered guys just so you know
137:10 - the whole thing
137:11 - this thing this thing everything but i
137:14 - just wanted this thing to be centered
137:15 - and so that's why i created we created
137:17 - another container beautiful
137:18 - now look at this this is pretty cool one
137:21 - last thing that i want to do david is
137:23 - you know what
137:26 - spacing okay that's fine spacing is good
137:28 - too yes that's that's important
137:30 - but not that what do you want to do then
137:33 - background color of this page
137:36 - of this full page guys we
137:40 - are almost done for today i'm not
137:42 - kidding we look at what we just created
137:43 - guys
137:44 - we have the banner we have the card page
137:47 - it looks sick okay now what i want to do
137:50 - is i'm going to go to the body
137:52 - let's go to here let's go to app.css
137:55 - for the body okay i want to change the
137:58 - background and color to this specific
138:00 - portion i'm going to copy this
138:02 - i got this david i got this duvet
138:05 - i know you want to type but it's here
138:07 - right there
138:08 - whoa look at this boom right there
138:12 - so here's what happens guys look at this
138:15 - this whole
138:16 - background color oh actually that's not
138:19 - good i don't like that
138:22 - okay wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
138:25 - wait wait i think it's because i need to
138:26 - go
138:27 - back to now my app.js
138:30 - and then for the div class name app
138:33 - let's see
138:34 - at this css i mean if you're not using
138:37 - css let's not do
138:38 - then let's not use css how do i make
138:41 - this whole thing
138:42 - color of that i mean then you want to go
138:45 - to app.js
138:47 - import style uh import
138:50 - style and no no no no no no no no no no
138:53 - no
138:54 - app but i need to make this background
138:58 - color of this maybe i need to make this
138:59 - background color
139:01 - i mean we can say app here instead of
139:05 - this this thing sort of what
139:10 - let's do it with a stop component
139:13 - right so if you go ahead uh in app.js we
139:16 - import styled
139:18 - components notice the
139:22 - rename the div uh with like th this this
139:26 - guy was a div
139:27 - and you can go into the app okay that's
139:28 - fine yeah i named it app
139:30 - and now i'm gonna um you can't
139:34 - absolutely div i mean it's still the
139:36 - same situation that's fine
139:38 - yeah well div
139:43 - and now we can or what was
139:46 - actually the background color what
139:50 - yeah yeah oh yeah okay and now it's the
139:53 - same situation
139:54 - what's up whoa
139:57 - that's new app has already been declared
140:01 - yes because you cannot do app into
140:02 - container david container then we do
140:05 - container

140:12 - container guys okay good so container is
140:14 - what we're gonna call okay good
140:16 - holy moly that's fine all right it's not
140:19 - like it still doesn't do what i want to
140:20 - do because here's the thing you see this
140:22 - bottom section
140:23 - i think it has to do something with the
140:25 - height i think that's what it has to do
140:27 - i think we need to work on the height of
140:28 - the actual thing let me see
140:30 - let me just think here for a second we
140:32 - have the app we have the app.css that's
140:34 - fine
140:36 - [Music]
140:38 - how do we go ahead what's going on here
140:40 - let me see inspect element icon color
140:43 - let me see a separate window
140:48 - where is that wait what's up let me see
140:50 - so what i'm trying to do
140:51 - is the background color you see how it's
140:54 - it's wonky here
140:55 - i don't like it so let me see minimum
140:58 - height
141:03 - that's fine that's fine
141:08 - back on what's there's add the linear
141:12 - gradient
141:13 - the what oh oh here's there we go that's
141:16 - why look at this right there you see
141:18 - this oh
141:20 - that's on the content so that's what was
141:22 - messed up the whole time you see this
141:24 - right there you see the guys so now this
141:26 - looks a lot lot better you see this
141:27 - background white that was the issue the
141:29 - whole time
141:29 - boom boom boom boom boom so if i go see
141:32 - this is why it's so important guys
141:34 - sometimes to be able to go for example
141:35 - to see the big picture this is why i
141:37 - like to go into an inspect element right
141:38 - here
141:39 - i like to see the big picture that we
141:41 - have and i can play around because
141:44 - you know going back and forth trying to
141:45 - try different things it's going to take
141:46 - a long time and react gs and so
141:48 - instead i like to go to stop you i like
141:50 - to inspect element
141:51 - go to it check check and check and check
141:53 - and see kind of what may change that
141:55 - makes
141:55 - and so that allows you to really easily
141:57 - see it and so what that does now if i go
141:59 - back to my home.gs
142:01 - if i go back to content with my content
142:04 - back on white you see i can just now
142:06 - remove this right there
142:08 - someone goes in the comments try to
142:09 - display flex hello
142:12 - display affects everything beautiful so
142:14 - guys
142:15 - look at this guys look at what we have

152:26 - aws versus firebase well um so
152:29 - good question i mean firebase is a very
152:32 - very popular you know
152:33 - uh database aws i mean is is more than
152:36 - just firebase just so you know guys know
152:38 - aws is everything it's been able to
152:40 - deploy
152:41 - to essences it's been able to have like
152:44 - if it is pretty much
152:45 - can do anything on you know for your
152:48 - project may that be to serve on the
152:50 - server may that be
152:51 - to have different servers but david to
152:52 - scale right firebase is mainly
152:55 - made for kind of database you know uh
152:57 - and so forth
152:59 - for example go ahead you can host of
153:02 - that
153:02 - oh yeah sorry yeah but aws for example
153:04 - has many different file
153:06 - databases like aws right so there's uh
153:09 - there's my sequel database there's a no
153:12 - sql database and so forth
153:13 - firebase is just a nosql database guys
153:16 - right and so
153:17 - there's a lot more to aws and voice and
