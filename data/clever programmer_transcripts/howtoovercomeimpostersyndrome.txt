00:00 - how to be imposter syndrome as a
00:02 - developer the best way in my opinion you
00:04 - ship stuff you build things if you can
00:05 - build something even if it's a very tiny
00:07 - thing click it and it just says your
00:08 - name you click it button changes the
00:10 - color of the website whatever it is
00:11 - however small it is once you ship
00:13 - something and build something real it's
00:15 - going to take away imposter syndrome
00:16 - like this thing is real you can touch it
00:18 - feel it and every time you do something
00:20 - it works more stuff you make the more
00:22 - you will kill your imposter syndrome
