00:00 - hey guys how are you doing this is Kazi
00:02 - so in this video I'm going to talk about
00:05 - how to write a very fast and iterative
00:08 - solution to the Fibonacci problem now if
00:12 - you're at a job interview and they don't
00:15 - care whether you write a recursive
00:17 - function or a regular function and they
00:19 - give you okay go ahead and write
00:21 - Fibonacci please don't write it
00:23 - recursively because that is the naive
00:26 - solution of this problem the way you
00:29 - want to write it is the fast iterative
00:31 - way that I'd like to show you now this
00:34 - way is also you know you can see it on
00:36 - Stack Overflow and it's one of the most
00:38 - popular and the best ways to write it so
00:41 - it's very useful if you learn this
00:44 - initially you might have to memorize it
00:46 - but if you practice it enough times
00:48 - you'll start getting the hang of how
00:50 - this solution works so let's get started
00:53 - so I'm going to say I'm gonna define a
00:57 - Fibonacci of n okay
01:00 - and we're gonna say that in the start
01:05 - I'm gonna have some variable called a
01:07 - and B and I'm gonna set their values to
01:09 - 0 and 1 so remember those two values are
01:13 - given right 0 and 1 and then every
01:15 - valley after that is just the sum of the
01:17 - previous two so we're gonna use pythons
01:21 - multiple assignment operation here and
01:23 - the swapping value to you write a very
01:28 - elegant solution
01:29 - it's very pythonic so we're going to use
01:33 - some beautiful Python code and some
01:37 - Python built-in tricks to write this ok
01:40 - so now what I want to do is I want to
01:42 - run my I want to write a for loop that
01:46 - basically keeps adding values keep
01:50 - summing the previous two terms so my
01:52 - code is going to run the same number of
01:54 - times as the term that you're looking
01:56 - for so if you're looking for the fifth
01:58 - term is gonna run five times so here I'm
02:00 - gonna write my loop and I'm going to say
02:04 - is be a comma B is equal to B comma and
02:08 - here's the cool way I'm going
02:11 - show you so let's move this so this
02:14 - takes it makes use of some of pythons
02:17 - built-in elegance you know the
02:19 - assignment operators and the swapping of
02:22 - the values you can't really do this in
02:24 - another language you're gonna need
02:25 - something called a temporary variable if
02:27 - you're using C or Java or something like
02:30 - that so here what I'm effectively saying
02:33 - is B is now the previous term and the
02:37 - new term is the sum of the previous two
02:39 - terms okay so if we wanted to make a run
02:42 - through this we would effectively say
02:48 - okay I come down here B is 1 and a plus
02:52 - B in this case would be 0 plus 1 and you
02:55 - will get 1 okay and that's a third term
03:00 - so this is gonna always be the third
03:02 - term and this is always going to be the
03:05 - second to last term okay so a plus B
03:08 - this is the last last term and this B is
03:11 - the second to last term all right and at
03:15 - the end I'm just gonna say a return a so
03:20 - remember a is what we need to return at
03:24 - the end now I'm gonna run this solution
03:28 - okay okay so now I'm going to run my
03:35 - code here all right so I'm gonna say
03:38 - Python and basics that py oh whoops it's
03:43 - not going to return anything I gotta add
03:45 - a print print statement here I'm gonna
03:47 - say oops Fibonacci of let's say 2
03:59 - all right I got one that's good so let
04:02 - me just write the Fibonacci terms here
04:04 - so you guys can recall how they work and
04:08 - each one is some of the previous to do
04:11 - so here three plus five gives it gives
04:14 - you eight right here zero comma one
04:17 - so here zero plus one gives you one one
04:20 - plus two gives you three two plus three
04:22 - gives you five
04:23 - so each last term is a sum of the
04:25 - previous two and here you're gonna see
04:28 - that my code is gonna work so I'm gonna
04:30 - go and ask for the fifth term what's the
04:32 - fifth term this is the first second
04:34 - I'm sorry zeroth first second third
04:38 - fourth and fifth
04:40 - so fifth should give me five so let's
04:43 - run it and oh I have to save it first
04:47 - almost run it again and I'm getting back
04:49 - five okay and if I said give me the
04:51 - sixth term is gonna give me back eight
04:55 - all right so my code is working here and
05:00 - you can see this is a very simple
05:02 - solution it's very beautiful it's very
05:05 - pythonic and this is the way that you
05:08 - should write this solution when you're
05:10 - at a job interrview UK or if you're
05:12 - applying for programming boot camps or
05:14 - whatnot because a lot of the times
05:17 - you're gonna get a question like this
05:18 - they're gonna try to understand if not
05:21 - only you know how to write functions and
05:24 - algorithms but how efficiently you can
05:26 - write them so the iterative way is the
05:29 - way that I think you should approach
05:30 - this thank you for watching and I'll see
05:32 - you guys in the next video
