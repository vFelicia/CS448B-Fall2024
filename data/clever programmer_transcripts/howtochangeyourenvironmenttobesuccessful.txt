00:01 - hey guys what's up this is ky from
00:04 - clever
00:05 - program.com first of all do you guys
00:08 - think that my barber shop kind of
00:10 - butchered my hair if you think my hair
00:13 - sucks could you please comment that
00:15 - below so I could show my
00:17 - barber all right anyways um what I
00:21 - wanted to talk about today was your
00:22 - circle of
00:24 - influence the five people around you and
00:28 - there's a reason why to say that you're
00:30 - the average of your five people around
00:34 - you more than that they statistically
00:40 - shown that you're not only just like
00:43 - hand waving Le the average of five
00:46 - people around you in a way that you
00:48 - can't quantify there's actually a way to
00:50 - quantify this
00:52 - too even your income is the average of
00:56 - the five people around you and that's
00:58 - generally true
01:04 - so with the people that you're around
01:06 - you need to be careful with who you
01:08 - spend your time with and again I'm not
01:09 - saying you need to stop hanging out with
01:11 - your brother or your best friend or
01:12 - whatever right that's okay you can have
01:14 - those people in your life but there are
01:16 - certain people who you spend time with
01:18 - that'll actually motivate you to go to
01:20 - the next level they'll actually want you
01:22 - to do things that can help you achieve
01:26 - better things and improve your goals
01:31 - personally you know I spend a lot of
01:34 - time with my family and it's awesome
01:37 - every time I spend time with them it's
01:39 - great but it's never something that
01:41 - makes me want to achieve more goals
01:44 - because you know not everybody wants to
01:46 - talk about business or not everybody
01:47 - wants to talk about achieving more goals
01:49 - I mean sometimes it's okay to just relax
01:51 - and have fun and there's nothing wrong
01:52 - with
01:53 - that but I've surrounded myself at this
01:57 - point with friends who are always
01:59 - continuously pushing me while I'm
02:02 - pushing them to achieve their goals so
02:07 - you know a lot of my friends are into
02:08 - fitness or they want to uh learn maybe
02:12 - some kind of martial arts and I'm
02:14 - constantly pushing them to achieve that
02:16 - goal and I genuinely think that people
02:19 - who care about you that's what they
02:20 - should be doing instead of being okay
02:22 - with you sitting on your
02:25 - ass because sometimes inside it makes
02:28 - them feel okay about themselves right
02:31 - and even if they're not trying to
02:32 - intentionally do that generally people
02:36 - want you to get to their level just so
02:39 - they're comfortable even if they have no
02:41 - ill intention or they don't want to do
02:43 - any harm to you or whatever right but
02:45 - it's something that you need to
02:46 - understand on how people psychology
02:50 - works whatever stage of life people
02:53 - people are comfortable at that's where
02:55 - they'll want you to go so somebody who
02:57 - is behind you somebody who is not at the
03:02 - level that you're trying to get at
03:04 - they'll only bring you down to their
03:06 - level you need to surround yourself with
03:08 - people who are up at the top or who are
03:10 - where you want to go and again they
03:13 - don't have to be fake people you don't
03:14 - have to kiss ass to be their friend
03:17 - right they you can genuinely find people
03:20 - who are your good friends and are maybe
03:22 - even one step ahead of you and what
03:24 - happens then is that they want to pull
03:26 - you to their level because that's what's
03:28 - comfortable for them and they want you
03:30 - to get at the higher level of success
03:33 - and that gives you a way to motivate
03:34 - yourself and get to the next
03:37 - challenge you know those are some
03:39 - dangerous words when people try to make
03:41 - themselves feel content people will say
03:44 - I'm happy living the life that I'm
03:45 - living I'm living the dream my life is
03:48 - absolutely perfect come on sometimes you
03:50 - have to take a break I'm always busy so
03:53 - I have to come home and relax really you
03:55 - have to watch 40 hours of TV you know
03:58 - theyve proven statistically they've
04:00 - shown that Americans watch 40 hours of
04:05 - TV every
04:07 - week every
04:10 - week I mean that's an insane amount of
04:13 - time watching TV I became top 1% in the
04:17 - world for my chess rating and you know
04:20 - how I did it I literally replaced
04:23 - watching a TV show with watching a chess
04:26 - tutorial that took my skill to the next
04:28 - level like I would literally come home
04:30 - and when I would be eating food that's
04:32 - generally when I would watch TV and all
04:35 - I did was just replace TV with watching
04:37 - a chest
04:38 - tutorial and I watched something that
04:40 - was fun for me for you it could be
04:43 - something else maybe you like arts and
04:44 - crafts watch a tutorial on Photoshop
04:46 - watch a tutorial on arts and crafts I
04:48 - don't know whatever it is for
04:50 - you and by changing my surrounding of a
04:53 - video help me improve my level now
04:56 - changing your surrounding of actual
04:58 - people around you
05:00 - can 10x that can go 10 times that so
05:04 - that can tremendously help you get to
05:06 - your goals
05:08 - so you know sometimes you have to think
05:10 - of it consciously and it doesn't feel
05:12 - natural and I get that but it's okay
05:15 - like you have to
05:17 - consciously look around you for people
05:19 - who are more successful than you or at
05:21 - least who are a few steps ahead of you
05:23 - and I know it doesn't feel comfortable
05:25 - being around them because then you feel
05:26 - like a failure but that's good because
05:29 - you should try to make yourself feel low
05:33 - so you can get to the next level don't
05:35 - let it hurt your self-esteem right like
05:37 - that's your way of getting to the next
05:40 - level it's like picking up a dumbbell
05:41 - that you can't lift but you're like holy
05:43 -  like that's the level I want to get
05:45 - to that's how you should try to treat it
05:48 - so have a few people that you can
05:51 - follow and replace certain things like
05:54 - if you watch TV shows you can watch them
05:56 - that's totally fine but if you're eating
05:58 - and you realize that's a pattern every
06:00 - day watch something that you enjoy it
06:02 - doesn't have to be the most boring to
06:04 - death tutorial watch something that's
06:06 - actually maybe a little bit fun but it
06:08 - has to do with what you're
06:09 - learning or what you want to learn and
06:12 - improve at so it could be like a fun
06:14 - live stream of some person you watch
06:16 - doing Photoshop or playing a video game
06:19 - if you want to get better at video games
06:20 - whatever it is for you right I watch
06:22 - jitsu videos CU I love Jiu-Jitsu and I
06:24 - love martial arts so I'll watch
06:25 - Jiu-Jitsu training instead of or like
06:27 - Jiu-Jitsu Fighters fighting and I'll be
06:30 - picking up techniques while I'm eating
06:31 - so I'm enjoying but I'm also picking up
06:33 - new
06:34 - techniques so change the things around
06:38 - you in a comfortable way where it's not
06:41 - like you have to pull your teeth to make
06:43 - those things work but start noticing
06:45 - each thing and start changing them so
06:48 - change your habit of the people you hang
06:50 - out with right if all they do is just
06:55 - nothing that's not a person you want to
06:58 - spend a lot of your time with
07:01 - if you're watching too many TV shows
07:03 - that are nothing replace that with a
07:04 - tutorial if you're listening to music
07:06 - all the time I mean music doesn't
07:09 - achieve anything great for you if it
07:10 - helps you focus and do something
07:11 - productive great but I know a lot of
07:14 - people just listen to music for the hell
07:15 - of it and I did so I did that and I
07:17 - still do that but if you just replace
07:19 - your music with like listening to
07:21 - audiobooks that's another one of those
07:23 - life hacks that can change your life
07:26 - so your friends around you be more
07:29 - conscious I of
07:30 - them still be you know Bros with your
07:33 - Bros or if you have your girlfriends
07:36 - that you're really good with you know
07:37 - for your ladies out there if you have
07:39 - your friends who you're really tight
07:41 - with I'm not saying to leave any of them
07:44 - I'm just saying be more conscious of
07:46 - adding some new people into your circle
07:48 - of friends that are ahead of you so it
07:50 - makes you want to get at that level make
07:52 - yourself a little bit uncomfortable
07:54 - change your habits of what you watch
07:56 - change your habits of what you listen to
07:58 - in a very simple way and it will have a
08:01 - dramatic impact on your life all right
