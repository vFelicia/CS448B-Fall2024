00:00 - hey guys so here's what I want you to do
00:02 - for your code and how you should run and
00:05 - how you should follow along for like
00:08 - kind of all of the exercises okay so
00:11 - first of all I'm using pycharm for now
00:16 - if you aren't familiar and really
00:19 - comfortable with a command line
00:21 - don't use the software okay you can use
00:25 - it at a later point but for now I want
00:28 - you to use something called sublime text
00:30 - okay because this will let you kind of
00:33 - practice your ninjutsu in the command
00:36 - line okay so it's like a good workout
00:38 - and you will become a ninja trust me
00:41 - does don't don't use this for now just
00:44 - sublime text and here's how you're going
00:46 - to I want to just teach you a full-on
00:48 - method and how you can actually have a
00:51 - your own workflow in your working
00:52 - environment how it should look so this
00:56 - took me years to figure out okay so I'm
00:58 - giving you really good pearls here now
01:02 - what I'm gonna do is let's say go to
01:05 - wherever you want to do this okay so
01:07 - maybe go to learn Python or clever
01:09 - programmer or on your computer you might
01:12 - have some other folder on your desktop
01:13 - okay some people like to do it on the
01:15 - desktop let's just do it right here so
01:17 - right on my desktop I will do this okay
01:22 - I will actually why don't we just kind
01:25 - of do it live all right I'm gonna create
01:30 - a new folder here and I'm gonna call it
01:34 - Python Oh Oh P okay learn Python old P
01:39 - and I'm going to put it right over
01:42 - wherever you can put it whatever I'm
01:44 - just really crazy about keeping it clean
01:49 - alright so inside of this folder you can
01:53 - you know open up a new thing or just
01:55 - open up sublime so you can just open up
01:57 - sublime text it's not related to that
01:59 - particular folder now I have a window
02:02 - management system that I'm paying money
02:04 - for that allows me to really quickly put
02:08 - my windows in a neat way if you don't
02:10 - have it that's fine just do it manually
02:12 - I'm using something called spectacle a
02:14 - lot of people ask me about this and by
02:18 - doing this you can see that everything
02:20 - is set up to the left-hand side here
02:22 - okay and so here I'll write my code and
02:27 - I'll save that file in learn Python o P
02:31 - okay and I'll show you how to do that
02:32 - step by step so I'm gonna make this
02:35 - really huge so you can see it clearly
02:37 - and let's just write hello world if
02:44 - that's actually a little too huge it's
02:46 - not in any colors right now cuz it
02:48 - doesn't know what language you're using
02:49 - but once you tell sublime text it's
02:51 - extremely intelligent and it'll figure
02:53 - it out so I'm gonna go to desktop and
02:55 - I'll go to learn Python olp and I'm
02:59 - gonna change the name of this file and
03:00 - we'll call it example dot py okay or
03:04 - hello whoops hello world out py and now
03:13 - you can see that it's saved right there
03:15 - okay alright now what you want to do is
03:19 - actually know how to run this file okay
03:22 - how do you actually run this code we're
03:26 - going to open up terminal so you can
03:28 - open up your terminal terminal on your
03:31 - Mac I have I terminal it's a little
03:34 - fancier one so if you want to go ahead
03:36 - and install that go ahead run Windows
03:38 - you're gonna probably have to stick with
03:40 - git bash which is still a pretty it's
03:42 - it's pretty good like just make sure you
03:45 - go online and download it it doesn't
03:46 - come built-in with the windows because
03:48 - the windows command prompt really sucks
03:50 - so you need a Linux command line system
03:53 - so if you actually look up on Google get
03:55 - bash and download it you should
03:58 - essentially virtually have a full you'd
04:01 - be able to follow along the course okay
04:03 - now I'm gonna open up my terminal okay
04:08 - so I term again you can open up your
04:12 - turn regular terminal go away alright so
04:17 - I'm gonna bring this over and I've set
04:20 - it up all the way to the right side all
04:22 - these notifications
04:25 - okay so from my terminal I'm gonna go to
04:27 - that learn Python LP folder on my
04:31 - desktop so follow along and see how I'm
04:33 - gonna do it first of all I'm gonna hit
04:35 - LS which is lists directory so it's
04:37 - essentially like me looking around the
04:39 - room and seeing what's around me I
04:41 - noticed desktop so I'm gonna say CD
04:44 - desktop CD means change directory so now
04:48 - I am in my desktop so essentially I am
04:51 - right here this is where I am now okay
04:56 - this just doesn't have a graphical user
04:58 - interface but you're still pretty much
05:00 - traveling the same way you are with the
05:01 - mouse all around your computer now what
05:04 - I want to do is I'm gonna go to CD learn
05:07 - Python Hopi and by hitting tab it
05:10 - autocompletes that for me okay if you
05:14 - don't hit tab you'll have to write this
05:16 - whole thing but you will get an error
05:18 - guaranteed because it thinks learn is
05:22 - one command Python is another command
05:24 - and olp is another command so one good
05:27 - practice to do is never name your files
05:30 - on your computer with spaces just like
05:33 - separated by something like underscores
05:36 - okay so just put an underscore there and
05:38 - put an underscore there okay now when I
05:42 - oughta complete this and I try to go
05:44 - there you see it puts underscores there
05:47 - for you let me hit LS again underscore
05:50 - so just one name now
05:52 - alright now let's hit change directory
05:55 - and if we hit LS what do you expect we
05:58 - will see well we will just see what's in
06:02 - our folder hello world okay so I'm going
06:07 - to hit LS and let's just check it out
06:09 - and indeed you see hello world dot py
06:12 - and now let's run this code and how we
06:15 - can run it is by saying python hello
06:18 - world dot py and you can see that I ran
06:23 - that code okay and how you run it
06:26 - normally no normal workflows you just
06:28 - hit up and enter up and enter up and
06:29 - enter every time you have to rerun it so
06:31 - don't be afraid of that what you're
06:33 - gonna do is like you're gonna write some
06:34 - code right like let's say you you want
06:36 - to write a loop that goes up to ten
06:38 - and prints out from zero to ten you're
06:40 - gonna save it okay
06:42 - oh it says uh no such directory and the
06:45 - reason why that happened is I changed
06:47 - the directory on it so I got to go back
06:48 - to my desktop learn Python o P and let's
06:54 - just do hello world dot py and replace
06:59 - it for now that's fine and save it okay
07:02 - so you're gonna hit save I hit command S
07:04 - on my computer you can hit ctrl s these
07:07 - are important shortcuts okay and then
07:10 - what I want to do is I want to switch to
07:12 - the terminal screen so you can do it
07:13 - with the mouse but a better workflow is
07:16 - just hit alt tab if you're on Windows or
07:19 - command tab if you're on a Mac so hit
07:21 - command tab and switch so you see how
07:24 - I'm switching between my sublime text
07:25 - and my terminal that's how you want to
07:28 - do it okay command tab so I'm gonna hit
07:31 - command tap hit up and enter and you see
07:34 - how that code just ran and it said hello
07:37 - world and it did that for loop part that
07:39 - I wrote now I'm gonna hit command tab go
07:41 - back to sublime text and let's say I'm
07:43 - gonna add something I'm gonna say a
07:45 - print bananas okay and I'm gonna hit
07:49 - save because if I don't hit save the new
07:52 - changes don't show up I'm gonna hit
07:54 - command tab up and enter okay I delete
07:57 - it save command tab up and enter okay so
07:59 - it's a really kind of natural works left
08:02 - or you get used to it and your terminal
08:04 - screen if it's bothering you you can
08:06 - have it like smaller and to the side and
08:08 - you can open up your text editor much
08:11 - wider you know it really it depends how
08:14 - you do it I'll just do it half and half
08:17 - or maybe I'll make the terminal like in
08:19 - the top right it's just really how it's
08:23 - comfortable for you but definitely
08:25 - having it side by side is a better way
08:27 - to do it then have sublime text save it
08:30 - then open up your terminal then run it
08:32 - very slow this is very fast very adult
08:36 - and this is definitely the right way to
08:38 - do it so there you go that's your
08:41 - workflow you can thank me later I've
08:44 - saved you like years of time because
08:47 - people just don't use these shortcuts
08:49 - and don't they don't take advantage of
08:50 - these workflows so
08:52 - take advantage of this and go and kick
08:55 - ass alright that's it for this video I
08:58 - hope you learn and are going to adapt
09:01 - this workflow leave in the comments
09:03 - below if something was unclear didn't
09:04 - make sense and I'll see you in the next
09:07 - video
09:17 - you
