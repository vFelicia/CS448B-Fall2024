00:00 - - Two questions.
00:01 - Why are you so beautiful and what the heck
00:04 - was I just talking about?
00:05 - Today we're gonna learn
how to install Python
00:08 - in less than five minutes.
00:10 - So let's get started.
00:10 - (crackling)
00:17 - Okay, so the first thing you have to do
00:19 - is open a new tab in
Chrome or Internet Explorer
00:21 - or Mozilla Firefox.
00:22 - Go to your web browser,
type in Python 3 download.
00:27 - Simple as that.
00:28 - Click the first thing that
your eye can see or can't see.
00:31 - That's how fast you should be clicking.
00:33 - And instead of Python 2.7,
let's go to the latest version
00:37 - and install Python 3.51.
00:40 - You get this download
bar at the bottom here,
00:41 - click continue, continue,
continue, agree, right?
00:46 - You can read those
licenses, but just do it.
00:50 - And simply hit install.
00:53 - So I'm gonna hit install, I'm
gonna type in my password,
00:55 - let's wait for the install.
00:57 - Alright, so our download was successful.
00:59 - Move to trash.
01:01 - Alright, after you're done installing it,
01:05 - I want you to do something
simple and look for
01:07 - an app called idle.
01:09 - You should now have it,
and effectively here,
01:13 - you should be able to
run your Python code.
01:15 - Let's try five plus five, boom!
01:17 - It's giving us something.
01:18 - 10 times 20, yes.
01:20 - X is equal to five, x times five, 25.
01:23 - It's working.
01:25 - Print "Hello".
01:28 - It's all working.
01:29 - Amazing, we're up and running, you guys,
01:31 - in just, I don't know,
less than five minutes.
01:34 - Let us simply type in our terminal.
01:39 - If you're sitting on Mac,
you would nee to type in term
01:43 - like this, hit enter, and you
should come to this screen
01:46 - and if you type in Python,
it should now be running
01:50 - your Python as well, and you
should be able to just type
01:53 - your code in here.
01:54 - So, this is how you install Python
01:56 - and I will see you in the next video.
