00:41 - you guys that's actually the most
00:43 - valuable for you
00:44 - and brings me the most amount of peace
00:46 - and we can create the most
00:47 - transformations
00:48 - and what came to me is i want to help
00:50 - you guys
00:51 - directly get freelancing work because
00:54 - that's what i was incredibly good at
00:56 - right like sunny and everybody has their
00:57 - own
00:58 - strengths sunny is incredible at landing
01:00 - six figure jobs
01:02 - so is nods my strength was freelancing
01:05 - and i want to share that with you guys
01:08 - and i want to the thing that excited
01:12 - me was what if we got together and in
01:15 - the month of november
01:16 - we collectively even if we generated
01:20 - ten thousand dollars extra that would be
01:22 - like mind-blowing
01:23 - if we could take that to a hundred
01:25 - thousand dollars in some months
01:27 - collectively growing income as a
01:29 - developer that would be a dream come
01:30 - true
01:31 - but even if we could do that that would
01:33 - be amazing
01:35 - and for for that to happen only 10 of
01:38 - you guys
01:38 - would need to land 1 000 jobs in the
01:41 - month of november
01:42 - do you think that that's possible
01:46 - i think that that's possible and that's
01:47 - what i'm really excited
01:49 - to help you transform and all of us to
01:52 - do that together as a goal
01:55 - so if you're in it with me do let me
01:57 - know in the comments and so i thought
01:58 - okay
01:59 - let's go about let's go about this and
02:02 - make that happen because that's a goal
02:03 - that actually seems exciting that's a
02:05 - goal that
02:06 - it's inspiring for me to should show up
02:10 - if not every day on a very regular basis
02:13 - on this channel
02:14 - and help you do because look there's
02:17 - long-term thinking
02:18 - and i think long-term thinking is great
02:20 - right so let me like if i can just draw
02:22 - here for a second
02:23 - so like if we have long-term thinking
02:25 - here long-term thinking is great you
02:27 - wanna let's say get to
02:29 - this part right over here right
02:32 - are you guys able to see this uh you're
02:35 - not okay so give me one second
02:38 - i'm gonna go ahead and do that and now
02:41 - let's try it okay beautiful
02:42 - so let's say that this is a graph
02:46 - and long-term thinking says hey you want
02:49 - to get to here
02:50 - right you want to get your income to
02:51 - let's say i don't know 10k
02:54 - per month as a developer um
02:57 - okay that's um that's awesome that's
03:00 - long term
03:01 - but what about all these steps right
03:03 - here what about all these steps
03:05 - nobody talks about them what what about
03:07 - every single what about your first
03:09 - five dollars what about your first
03:13 - uh 500 what about your first
03:17 - one thousand dollars does that make
03:19 - sense
03:21 - hopefully that makes sense for you guys
03:24 - and
03:24 - this guy's by the way nikhil welcome
03:26 - khalid felix
03:27 - tech awesome now with this
03:32 - um what i want you guys to understand is
03:34 - it's possible for you at any level that
03:36 - you are okay even if you're a complete
03:37 - beginner i'm going to go more into that
03:39 - in a little bit but all levels are
03:41 - welcome on this challenge that i'm going
03:43 - to be doing in november
03:44 - we can get started on this challenge
03:46 - right now by the way and we'll
03:48 - extend it all the way to november and
03:49 - and beyond that
03:51 - so those are the steps
03:54 - so you can't think long term without
03:56 - figuring out short term
03:58 - right like you can think long term but
04:00 - if you didn't eat your food today you
04:01 - will die
04:02 - so if you have to pick between long term
04:04 - or short term you have to pick short
04:05 - term because short term is necessary for
04:07 - survival
04:08 - long term isn't here yet so you have to
04:11 - design your short term so
04:12 - today is about designing that short term
04:14 - so then it can meet our long term does
04:16 - that make sense
04:18 - are you with me on that can i get a yes
04:21 - beautiful so with that said
04:25 - let's go ahead and move forward so my
04:27 - goal is to help you guys get your first
04:29 - five dollars this month or your first
04:33 - 500
04:34 - or your first 1 000 or whatever okay and
04:37 - and we can even go from there
04:39 - but i need you guys to commit to that
04:41 - because if you don't commit
04:42 - i don't need to be here on this live i'm
04:44 - here for you
04:45 - and i want us to grow together okay so i
04:48 - want all of us to commit and
04:50 - say yes that i commit to making an extra
04:52 - 1 000
04:54 - in november and i want you to actually
04:56 - take the time
04:57 - energy and effort to type that out
05:00 - because when you actually do that and
05:02 - you type it out
05:03 - you are telling your body and yourself
05:07 - that this is serious to me that i want
05:09 - to do
05:10 - this you're creating literally
05:11 - neurological pathways in your brain that
05:14 - say
05:14 - yes i'm actually going to do this in
05:17 - november
05:18 - just by you saying that the time how
05:21 - much money you're going to make
05:22 - what month you're going to do it in your
05:25 - chances are going to increase by 200 or
05:27 - 300 percent
05:30 - all right it's called implementation
05:31 - intention
05:33 - scientists found that the group that
05:36 - just sets an implementation intention
05:37 - versus a group that was given
05:40 - like crazy motivation advice the group
05:42 - that only set implementation and tension
05:45 - had a 90 success rate whereas the group
05:47 - that was given all the motivation in the
05:48 - world only had a 30
05:49 - success rate to commit to a fitness
05:52 - program okay so the two groups
05:54 - so i want you to be the implementation
05:56 - intention group all right
05:58 - so with that said let's go forward with
06:00 - this i was having a conversation with
06:02 - sally on instagram and she said hey i'm
06:04 - so psyched for this challenge and she
06:06 - said i have a general career question i
06:08 - currently make around 100
06:10 - 000 canadian dollars at the full-time as
06:13 - a performance marketer
06:15 - i love what i do but i hate working for
06:17 - someone else
06:18 - as much as doing what you love salary
06:21 - as much as doing what you love
06:25 - salary and monetary compensation
06:27 - actually plays
06:28 - a big role in my decisions and guys this
06:30 - is true for all of us this is why i say
06:32 - short short-term
06:33 - thinking matters it may be shallow
06:37 - question but is it possible to become a
06:39 - six-figure hopefully usd developer
06:41 - without having to work
06:42 - crazy hours is this possible so let's
06:45 - get into this
06:47 - and she goes i don't mean right away but
06:48 - my goal is to make a decent living
06:50 - without
06:51 - working 60 plus hours a week
06:54 - who can resonate here with her
06:57 - do any of you guys want this as a goal
07:02 - hey i'm here pre amir says
07:06 - i preach you i've learned a lot so this
07:09 - is important and he says
07:11 - and i mean really a lot but i still
07:13 - can't land a single five dollar gig so
07:16 - that's what i want to get into that
07:17 - short term practicality of how to make
07:19 - it happen
07:20 - that's what i'm good at
07:23 - awesome people are saying yes yes yes
07:26 - yes
07:26 - that's awesome we got [ __ ] on saying
07:29 - that
07:31 - you need to learn how to market yourself
07:33 - okay awesome
07:35 - so now let's keep going now why don't
07:37 - you get
07:38 - clients and performance marketing i
07:40 - asked her and she said well i'm in a min
07:42 - management
07:42 - so under my contract i can't market for
07:45 - any new clients and i said okay i see
07:47 - you can
07:48 - so there are two options for you right
07:50 - now i said one you can
07:51 - quit and then do it meaning get
07:54 - performance marketing clients
07:56 - or two you can start getting coding
07:58 - clients while
07:59 - you are doing your current job so which
08:02 - one do you guys resonate with and i
08:04 - asked her and i said
08:05 - which one and she responded
08:08 - and she said number two
08:12 - and she said okay then learn and then i
08:15 - said okay
08:15 - then learn coding and you can do it in
08:17 - few months or less
08:20 - start with less code intensive jobs you
08:22 - can get clients
08:23 - right this second who need help with
08:25 - squarespace now guys
08:27 - do you know about squarespace or wix or
08:29 - wordpress or any of those platforms
08:31 - i'm sure you all do because that's how
08:33 - most websites are made and everybody's
08:34 - familiar with them
08:36 - there are clients right now who are like
08:38 - hey i will pay you two thousand dollars
08:41 - to help me set up a squarespace website
08:43 - that website will take you under seven
08:46 - minutes
08:46 - i created from scratch from buying the
08:50 - domain to starting
08:51 - a website it took me seven minutes it's
08:53 - point
08:54 - and click you go to squarespace and you
08:56 - just sign up and you create a website
08:58 - point and click there are things where
09:01 - you don't even need
09:02 - a lot of code to be able to do okay so i
09:05 - want you to start
09:06 - getting married to the practicality not
09:09 - how you're going to do it people are
09:11 - like i need to make
09:13 - it needs to be a python thing where i
09:15 - write code it needs to be a javascript
09:17 - thing where i write code and bleed for
09:18 - my eyes writing javascript code and then
09:20 - i get paid
09:21 - ten dollars and that's okay cool then
09:24 - you don't make an income and don't
09:25 - provide anything for your family and
09:26 - stay exactly where you are
09:28 - next let's talk to the next person who's
09:30 - actually interested
09:32 - so you need to make coding a
09:36 - practicality right if she doesn't have
09:37 - that much experience yet
09:39 - and she doesn't start making an income
09:41 - from coding asap
09:42 - she's not going to want to do coding you
09:44 - guys understand that
09:45 - so she needs wins and all of you need
09:49 - more wins so what do you do
09:52 - if your coding experience is not that
09:54 - jacked yet where somebody's gonna pay
09:56 - you five or ten thousand dollars for a
09:57 - job
09:58 - can you take less code intensive jobs is
10:00 - my question to you
10:03 - can you take on a job that
10:06 - is based on point and click can you do
10:09 - that
10:09 - that still has to do with tech that
10:11 - still has to do with maybe the
10:13 - direction you want to go because one you
10:15 - can start making an extra thousand or
10:16 - two thousand or five thousand dollars a
10:18 - month
10:18 - that gives you a lot of room and time to
10:21 - have your own clients
10:22 - to make your own income to set your own
10:24 - hours to code as much as you want to
10:26 - learn as fast as you want
10:28 - to take the three thousand dollars and
10:29 - invest into a coding boot camp into
10:31 - yourself to excel your skills
10:32 - does that make sense gives you options
10:35 - money buys you freedom
10:36 - right dope
10:40 - all right so and she goes oh perfect
10:44 - does your november challenge go through
10:46 - ways we can get these less demanding
10:47 - clients and i said yeah
10:50 - i'm gonna show you every [ __ ] way on
10:51 - this planet that i know of to make more
10:53 - income
10:55 - she goes yes hopefully i can be one of
10:58 - the ten thousand dollars
11:00 - one of the people who makes total of ten
11:02 - thousand dollars
11:03 - and i said yes now let me ask you guys
11:07 - would any of you like to be one of the
11:09 - people who
11:10 - accumulatively makes ten thousand
11:13 - dollars in the month
11:14 - of november i don't care if you made
11:16 - five dollars in november's you're adding
11:18 - to the collective total as we move

16:07 - thousands of people who want to become
16:09 - developers

16:13 - but will make ten dollars from coding
16:16 - this month in november and that's gonna
16:18 - give them the momentum that they never
16:20 - had

16:30 - people so if you could please do that
16:32 - that would mean the world with that said
16:33 - let's just keep on going guys
16:36 - now here's something i want to share
16:37 - with you guys um there's a lot of
16:39 - insight that you're going to get from
16:41 - these live streams as well because
16:43 - everything that i'm picking up in my own
16:45 - days i'm going to start sharing them
16:46 - with you guys
16:48 - so one of the things that i want to
16:51 - share with you guys
16:52 - is my current uh income is at about
16:55 - three to four thousand dollars a day
16:57 - all right what that basically means is
17:00 - if you make three thousand dollars a day
17:02 - you are on track to hit one million
17:04 - dollars a year all right so three to
17:06 - four thousand is my average income
17:08 - and that puts me on track to hit over a
17:10 - million dollars a year
17:12 - how many of you would like to make a
17:14 - million dollars a year
17:15 - probably most of you now even if we
17:18 - don't go for the million dollar a year
17:19 - goal
17:20 - we go for something smaller we can still
17:24 - break our ceiling that we're at and
17:26 - increase my personal income goal is to
17:28 - get to two million dollars a year
17:31 - or more but that requires me to develop
17:34 - certain habits and do certain things
17:35 - every single day and optimize myself
17:39 - so if you want to double or triple your
17:41 - income you have to start optimizing
17:43 - yourself
17:44 - all right if you're ready to start
17:45 - optimizing yourself let's get into that
17:47 - aspect now so one of the things that i
17:50 - noticed that i started doing
17:51 - is um and i said no to myself whoops you
17:54 - guys should really follow me on
17:55 - instagram if you don't already it's
17:57 - um i do a lot of uh awesomeness there
18:01 - uh thank you for the 40 rupees donation
18:04 - i appreciate it
18:05 - so here's a note to self um
18:09 - i personally really enjoy walking
18:12 - and i walk to starbucks all right it's
18:15 - like part of my ritual
18:17 - getting black coffee is just amazing
18:20 - because when there's things sitting in
18:21 - my stomach
18:22 - that doesn't get me optimized it gets me
18:24 - lazy and tired
18:26 - so i recommend you do something like
18:28 - this you don't have to do my exact
18:30 - routine
18:30 - but you can do things and optimize it
18:32 - for yourself where you feel
18:34 - really powerful energetic and at peace
18:36 - with yourself
18:37 - so start thinking about what those
18:38 - things are for you and write them down
18:40 - as i go so you guys can even drop your
18:43 - suggestions
18:44 - in the in youtube comments because i'm
18:47 - like looking at that
18:50 - um snail says i want to land even five
18:53 - dollars and i'd be good to go
18:54 - awesome another thing is reading a book
18:57 - so every morning i like to give myself
19:00 - ample amount of time to get started with
19:02 - my day i like to
19:03 - go slow so then i can go really fast
19:06 - later does that make sense guys
19:07 - so by optimizing my brain and my body
19:10 - i'm then re i start getting
19:11 - revved up and these are my current
19:13 - routines these might change
19:15 - but right now they're really helping me
19:16 - have a balance of
19:18 - good health good mind good income and
19:21 - good relationships
19:22 - so i'm just sharing with you guys what's
19:24 - working for me
19:27 - definitely being alone for a certain
19:29 - amount of time so i don't have external
19:31 - forces
19:31 - in my head is like impo very important
19:34 - for me so that's one thing i recommend
19:35 - for you as well maybe in your morning
19:37 - ritual
19:38 - you can add being alone uh to it
19:42 - right that's something that's good so
19:44 - one of the so that's good
19:45 - i listen to like loaf lo-fi loafy music
19:49 - and you can just find it on spotify you
19:51 - can literally type in loafy chill vibes
19:53 - music because
19:54 - when there's music with words i start
19:56 - paying attention to the words
19:57 - so i like to actually listen to loafy so
19:59 - then that just like calms me down and
20:01 - keeps me in a good zone
20:04 - uh read something you don't have to read
20:06 - what i'm reading
20:07 - but what i'm reading right now is think
20:09 - like a monk by j
20:10 - shetty incredible book extremely
20:13 - practical i'll share some insights from
20:15 - it
20:15 - in a second and then write inspirational
20:17 - ideas so what inspires you right
20:20 - if you want to become a developer don't
20:22 - hold back
20:23 - write down yo i would love to actually
20:25 - make five thousand dollars a month i
20:26 - would love to make ten thousand dollars
20:28 - a month
20:28 - whatever your goal is two thousand
20:30 - dollars a month and then
20:32 - write down what are the action steps for
20:34 - you to take what are the habits that you
20:36 - can develop
20:37 - maybe you can develop a habit of you
20:39 - know
20:40 - reaching out to clients every single day
20:42 - maybe you can develop
20:44 - a habit of doing a sales call every
20:46 - single day maybe you can develop a habit
20:49 - of
20:49 - just downloading the app and going on
20:52 - yzant or going on take lessons or going
20:54 - on fiverr or going on upwork every
20:56 - single day does that make sense
20:59 - and then for me what i'm doing is
21:02 - um reflect on what my 100
21:05 - commitment for today will look like then
21:08 - ask
21:08 - what would happen as a result in my life
21:10 - if i committed with that level of
21:12 - intensity
21:13 - so for example before coming on this
21:15 - live stream i'm like okay
21:17 - what will my 100 commitment look like
21:19 - and i'm like
21:20 - my 100 commitment will look like showing
21:23 - up to
21:23 - this webinar training having slides
21:26 - prepared
21:27 - and coming in with just crazy intensity
21:30 - and focus
21:31 - right and what would happen as a result
21:35 - in my life if i committed with that
21:36 - level of intensity so here's what would
21:38 - happen right
21:39 - my goal is that i will help
21:43 - a lot of you create transformations even
21:46 - if it's out of a hundred thousand people
21:48 - that watch stuff
21:49 - even if it's ten people but it creates
21:51 - deep transformations within your life
21:53 - maybe one of you
21:54 - uses this to start making an additional
21:56 - one thousand or two thousand or five
21:57 - thousand
21:58 - dollars a month and now you can support
21:59 - your family now you can support yourself
22:01 - now you can go after your dreams and get
22:04 - after it
22:06 - that was the most incredible thing that
22:09 - i could experience and then what would
22:11 - happen
22:11 - selfishly for me the business income
22:14 - would improve
22:15 - my income would improve my life will
22:17 - improve because i've directly improved
22:19 - your life first
22:20 - so if i can help change your life first
22:22 - then you will
22:23 - be you will have no pro like for example
22:26 - you who's watching right now like
22:27 - directly you right
22:29 - if i added one thousand dollars to your
22:31 - pocket
22:32 - if i literally said something that you
22:34 - did today
22:35 - and you made an additional one thousand
22:37 - dollars would you be okay
22:39 - paying me fifty dollars yes or no
22:43 - would you be okay with paying me 200 yes
22:45 - or no
22:46 - would you be okay with paying me 500 yes
22:48 - or no
22:50 - of course you would because i literally
22:53 - did something that added value to your
22:55 - life
22:55 - up front so then for you to give me back
22:58 - something it's just like a no-brainer
22:59 - it's not a big deal
23:00 - so if you start to take on that mindset
23:03 - when it comes to freelancing
23:04 - your income is about to explode in
23:06 - november your life is about to change in
23:08 - november does that make sense
23:11 - so that is what that would look like and
23:14 - so i'm trying to ask myself on a daily
23:16 - basis so then i can have a certain level
23:18 - of intensity and vigor that i attack my
23:20 - day with
23:20 - and not just like kind of days through
23:23 - my day like most people or most
23:25 - developers would
23:26 - all right so with that said let's
23:29 - move on christian korean says i will pay
23:32 - you nine hundred dollars yup dope enough
23:33 - says i'll be okay to pay 500. yep
23:36 - so that makes sense right here christian
23:39 - i would pay you 900
23:40 - pay you 500 yes yes yes yes take that 50
23:44 - somebody says guy levitsky says
23:46 - yes right so boom there you go
23:49 - now here's something that i was reading
23:52 - in that book um think like a monk and
23:55 - this was
23:56 - really really powerful so in the
23:58 - mornings i want you to work on
24:00 - calming yourselves down so you're not
24:02 - focused on
24:03 - so much emotional reactivity
24:06 - so here's the thing that was really
24:08 - amazing for me to read
24:10 - in this book he's talking to a
24:14 - 10 year old monk who's teaching kids in
24:16 - his class
24:17 - how to jay shetty right talking to a 10
24:20 - year old monk
24:21 - who's teaching other little children
24:24 - um not alphabets but actually teaching
24:28 - those five year olds how to breathe
24:30 - so jay shetty goes i ask him why
24:34 - and the 10 year old monk goes because
24:35 - the only thing that stays with you
24:38 - from the moment you're born until the
24:40 - moment you die
24:41 - is your breath all your friends
24:45 - family the country you live in all of
24:48 - that can change
24:49 - the one thing that stays with you is
24:52 - your breath
24:55 - this 10 year old monk added when you get
24:58 - stressed
24:59 - what changes your breath when you get
25:02 - angry what changes
25:04 - your breath we experience every emotion
25:07 - with the change of the breath
25:09 - when you learn to navigate and manage
25:10 - your breath
25:12 - you can navigate any situation in life
25:19 - how powerful is that that was one of the
25:22 - most powerful
25:23 - and kind of relaxing and relieving
25:26 - things that i
25:28 - had the privilege to read and i think
25:31 - that it brings you some level of clarity
25:33 - in your life as well
25:36 - right so if you come from that place
25:39 - you're going to be in a very peaceful
25:40 - state of mind
25:42 - then that's going to empower you to do
25:44 - the really hard and practical things
25:46 - that you need to do later does that make
25:47 - sense
25:48 - but if you're frustrated or feeling like
25:50 - you're just trying to catch up every
25:51 - single day
25:52 - you're going to be irritated you're not
25:53 - going to want to do anything
25:55 - and every single distraction is going to
25:58 - distract you every single instagram post
26:00 - that's going to pop up or facebook post
26:02 - or linkedin post or
26:04 - youtube video is going to distract you
26:06 - away from your goal
26:09 - but if you have a clarity purpose
26:12 - peace the beautiful thing that's going
26:14 - to happen is
26:15 - you're oftentimes going to stop looking
26:17 - at instagram you're going to stop
26:18 - looking at facebook stop looking at
26:19 - youtube
26:20 - just so you can then go and focus on
26:22 - making more income
26:24 - bringing food on the table for your
26:26 - friends and family
26:28 - growing yourself as a human being and
26:31 - achieving your dreams as a developer
26:33 - does that make sense
26:35 - so that's very very powerful and i want
26:37 - you guys to kind of internalize that
26:38 - because
26:39 - this is going to create i'm not looking
26:41 - to just add five more dollars
26:43 - and i want to help you create a
26:46 - transformation within your mind
26:48 - because if you train your mind your life
26:50 - will change
26:51 - your life will change forever and it
26:53 - will never look the same
26:55 - and you all have it within you that
26:57 - literally
26:58 - a month from now your life can change
27:00 - right how many times does that happen
27:02 - where you maybe just
27:03 - made a decision to do something new that
27:05 - you never did before and you're like
27:06 - holy crap your
27:07 - life changed in that one moment maybe
27:10 - think about the
27:10 - day you decided you're gonna become a
27:12 - developer boom your life changed in that
27:14 - one day
27:15 - think about the day maybe you decided
27:16 - you're gonna start working out boom
27:18 - you're life changing that day
27:20 - now bad habits are the same way maybe
27:22 - one day you decided you love this bag of
27:24 - chips and now you eat that and
27:26 - your life has negatively been impacted
27:28 - your mind is the most powerful thing
27:30 - so if you decide that in this upcoming
27:33 - month i'm willing to change my life and
27:35 - actually focus
27:36 - and use this as a catalyst to my
27:38 - positive behavioral change
27:40 - and explode my income and maybe explode
27:42 - my career and
27:44 - explode the results and becoming a
27:45 - developer boom just like that you can
27:47 - change
27:48 - your life does that make sense so
27:51 - with that said here's another thing that
27:53 - i read from this book think like a monk
27:55 - which was phenomenal
27:57 - uh gvj says i'm gassed man that's
28:00 - awesome
28:00 - pretentious is my life change as soon as
28:02 - i made the amazon clone i got in pwj
28:04 - awesome
28:04 - michael what's up bro so here's the
28:07 - monkey mind
28:09 - and here's the monk mind all right so
28:11 - i'm gonna make this divider line in the
28:13 - middle
28:14 - now here is the monkey mine right
28:17 - overwhelmed by
28:18 - multiple branches here is the monk
28:21 - mind focused on the root of the issue
28:24 - the monkey mind coast and the passenger
28:27 - seat
28:29 - monk mind lives intentionally and
28:31 - consciously
28:32 - the monkey mind complains compares and
28:35 - criticizes
28:37 - monk mind compassionate caring
28:39 - collaborative
28:40 - okay so i'm going to give you examples
28:42 - of what this looks like
28:44 - right so for example you have a goal of
28:47 - hey i want to make more income i want to
28:49 - explode my income right
28:52 - so you're trying like all this random
28:54 - stuff and you're like yeah that's gonna
28:55 - explode my income i'm gonna
28:57 - i'm gonna like make this project and i'm
28:59 - gonna go through this coding tutorial
29:01 - and i'm gonna do this other thing and do
29:02 - this
29:03 - and all of a sudden you're like in five
29:06 - different places you're learning about
29:08 - eight different frameworks you're
29:10 - learning about
29:11 - 10 different languages but you're not
29:14 - making forward progress in your career
29:16 - as a developer you're not
29:17 - actually working for anybody and
29:18 - providing value you're not actually
29:20 - making the income that you want to be
29:21 - making
29:22 - all that's happening is a lot of
29:24 - movement all that's happening is what
29:27 - james clear in atomic habits calls a lot
29:30 - of
29:30 - motion right motion looks like
29:34 - you are let's say motion looks like this
29:37 - you feel like you did a lot
29:39 - but really all that's happening is
29:41 - you're moving in all these directions
29:43 - but you stop at the direction that you
29:45 - started with
29:48 - does that make sense guys what motion
29:50 - looks like
29:52 - this is motion all right now
29:56 - action looks like you start in one place
29:59 - and then you go
30:00 - to another place and then you go to
30:02 - another place all right that's what
30:03 - action helps you do
30:05 - so if you're not focused on the root
30:06 - issue and you're doing random things
30:08 - you're not going to make progress as the
30:10 - developer
30:11 - if you close in the passenger seat
30:14 - you're not going to make progress as a
30:15 - developer
30:16 - if you're going to complain and be like
30:18 - only other people make income and
30:20 - i can't do it and it's not for me versus
30:23 - you're like
30:24 - let me study the people who are actually
30:26 - crushing these goals let me learn from
30:28 - them
30:28 - let me collaborate with them you're
30:30 - going to see huge results
30:32 - right overthinks and procrastinates
30:35 - analyze and articulates
30:39 - monkey mind distracted by small things
30:41 - monk my discipline
30:43 - monkey mind short-term gratification
30:46 - monk mind
30:47 - long-term gain all right so
30:50 - think about all of these things and how
30:52 - powerful they can be
30:53 - to you making progress here's an
30:55 - important one for me
30:57 - commits to a long-term vision or goal
31:00 - and what this looks like you're making
31:01 - progress towards a long-term vision
31:03 - regardless of what's happening
31:05 - but if you don't do that you're gonna
31:07 - get you're gonna amplify the negatives
31:09 - in fear
31:11 - and you're gonna change on a whim so
31:14 - if you wanna make progress in your
31:16 - income you have to understand these
31:18 - principles because what's going to
31:19 - happen is
31:20 - if you're changing on a whim you're
31:22 - never going to make forward progress you
31:23 - guys know those people who try to lose
31:25 - weight but then like 100 days later
31:27 - they've tried so many things they've
31:28 - tried p90x and they've tried this and
31:30 - that and the other thing
31:31 - but they're never actually losing weight
31:33 - and they're frustrated
31:35 - do you know people who try to make
31:37 - income and make
31:38 - 5 000 steps and a lot of people do that
31:40 - right where they
31:42 - try different things but they actually
31:43 - never make forward progress
31:47 - with income it's the same way you need a
31:49 - lot of clarity and focus of your action
31:52 - and if you do those things over a longer
31:55 - period of time you get the results that
31:56 - you're looking for
31:59 - so that motion is my life karen baby
32:04 - says yes
32:06 - yep
32:09 - we're gonna talk about how to get the
32:11 - money bro in just a second
32:13 - so wind says let's talk about how we get
32:14 - the money bro so again
32:16 - this is an example of somebody who is
32:19 - um they want to focus on multiple
32:23 - branches
32:24 - whereas they don't want to pay attention
32:26 - to the root
32:28 - issue and the root issue of not making
32:31 - more income is actually
32:32 - nothing to do sometimes with the income
32:34 - it's actually to do with
32:35 - how you're planning on going about it
32:38 - it's to do
32:38 - with changing your mindset and how
32:40 - you're thinking
32:42 - and if you change that your income will
32:43 - explode so
32:46 - this is why i'm going over this stuff
32:48 - because it's deeper than just what it
32:49 - looks like at the surface level
32:51 - the people who make millions of dollars
32:53 - if you actually talk to them
32:55 - on a regular basis and become friends
32:57 - with them and not just
32:58 - shallowly look at them from the veil of
33:00 - social media what you'll realize
33:02 - is their values are pretty amazing most
33:05 - of the times
33:06 - and the income that they have generated
33:08 - is tied to their value
33:10 - so if you can get these values down the
33:13 - results will
33:14 - follow right money is nothing
33:18 - but a lagging indicator of skill and
33:20 - value
33:21 - all right money is nothing
33:25 - more than a lagging indicator of skill
33:28 - and value so for example if
33:31 - you develop a certain skill like coding
33:34 - and then
33:34 - you spend months and months and months
33:36 - or years working on it and then two
33:38 - you provide value in the job market by
33:40 - actually getting a job
33:41 - then you will get money right but you
33:44 - had to
33:45 - learn the skill and provide value first
33:47 - and then you get the money
33:48 - how does a business work how does this
33:50 - work right now i develop
33:52 - the skill of public speaking i read
33:54 - books and develop myself
33:55 - i train myself how to be better and
33:57 - better and better and better
33:58 - now i can help other people improve and
34:02 - move
34:02 - forward in life so now
34:06 - i can i not only develop the skill but
34:08 - i'm actually now providing
34:09 - value right which is why 500 people are
34:11 - live here watching this
34:13 - and then it's going to result in money
34:16 - for clever programmer the business and
34:18 - i will get the goals that i want
34:20 - personally in my life because i'm
34:21 - helping you
34:22 - achieve your goals in your life and move
34:24 - forward faster
34:26 - cool so that's all money is money is
34:29 - nothing more than that money is not this
34:31 - like
34:31 - thing that we actually think about money
34:33 - is actually pretty ethereal and
34:35 - intangible
34:38 - so it's it's just a byproduct of your
34:40 - values and what you do every single day
34:42 - all right so um
34:46 - yep all right let's move forward and i
34:50 - made a note to myself
34:51 - and i sent it over to amanat as well who
34:53 - put this here in this slide which is
34:54 - pretty awesome
34:58 - gvg says um this man is so real but so
35:02 - wise thanks for being real with us i
35:04 - appreciate you for saying that gvg
35:08 - i will always keep it real with you guys
35:11 - guys we just broke 500 viewers on this
35:13 - video let's [ __ ] go smash

35:28 - love be happy and smile

35:33 - smile right now
35:35 - you're gonna feel your energy change and
35:38 - you're gonna feel
35:40 - a shift in the information that you can
35:42 - actually take
35:43 - in and absorb all right just small
35:46 - physiological actions like smiling
35:49 - breathing can change everything about
35:52 - you
35:54 - alright so let's move forward
35:58 - and now let's talk about the thing that
35:59 - you guys came here for let's talk about
36:01 - making money as a developer who is
36:02 - excited for that who wants to make
36:05 - that much money as a developer cj says
36:12 - watching from south africa
36:14 - beautiful man thank you
36:17 - are you guys ready all right so just
36:20 - make sure that
36:21 - you turn off your phones or just put
36:23 - them on do not disturb okay
36:25 - it's simple just swipe down and then it
36:27 - allows you to put on do not disturb and
36:28 - you're good to go
36:30 - now um i think that
36:33 - i kind of want to just touch base on it
36:35 - not too deeply just a little bit so for
36:38 - example of course you have to learn the
36:41 - skills right that's kind of a
36:42 - non-starter
36:43 - but a few two things i want you guys to
36:47 - focus on
36:48 - is um making income
36:51 - as a developer okay so what do i mean
36:54 - one
36:54 - way one is by coaching other people so
36:58 - if you coach other people and you teach
37:00 - people coding you can make an
37:01 - income so what does that mean
37:05 - and why would somebody pay you to teach
37:06 - some coding that's a good question
37:08 - why somebody would pay you is coding is
37:10 - a highly sought after skill
37:12 - if you know how to write for loops and
37:15 - do simple if then statements you can
37:16 - teach somebody who doesn't know how to
37:18 - print hello world does that make sense
37:20 - that person who doesn't know more than
37:22 - print hello world
37:25 - is happy to pay you to learn how to do
37:28 - something with coding
37:29 - so you don't have to be this incredible
37:33 - developer with years and years of
37:35 - experience you can
37:36 - actually be a developer with not that
37:38 - much experience let's say that there are
37:40 - levels to this [ __ ] right
37:41 - and this is like level 10 developer and
37:43 - this is level one
37:44 - level one is somebody who
37:47 - knows how to like print hello world
37:50 - right so like pretty much
37:51 - pretty much just just starting with
37:53 - coding and
37:54 - maybe level two is somebody who knows
37:56 - the basics of programming so they can
37:58 - write for loops and things like that
38:00 - and can solve very basic problems and
38:03 - then level three
38:04 - is maybe somebody who can like make
38:05 - projects right
38:07 - who can make some simple projects with
38:10 - coding
38:11 - now if you're a level two or you're a
38:13 - level three
38:15 - you can teach somebody who's at a level
38:17 - one does that make sense
38:18 - you can teach people who are behind you
38:21 - you can teach people
38:22 - because you're trailblazing what i am
38:24 - doing right now is
38:25 - called i'm trailblazing i'm going and
38:28 - learning stuff and then i come and share
38:30 - it i then go learn and i share
38:32 - it i just read about think like a monk
38:34 - and i shared it did you guys get value
38:35 - out of that by the way
38:37 - if you did i didn't read the whole book
38:41 - i'm not a monk
38:41 - i'm not a [ __ ] monk but you still got
38:44 - some value out of it
38:45 - all i did is i read a part of a book and
38:47 - then i shared it with you
38:49 - you can literally have just learned the
38:51 - basics and you can share them with
38:53 - somebody who's behind you
38:54 - and they'll actually pay you for it
39:05 - that makes sense so that's one way to
39:08 - make an income
39:09 - and you can actually be a beginner in
39:11 - coding and you can actually do this
39:13 - this stream of income is the fastest to
39:15 - develop because it has the lowest
39:17 - barrier to entry and you can start as
39:19 - early as
39:20 - now today right this hour
39:23 - you can start that's the thing about
39:26 - this one okay
39:27 - freelance work is a little bit more
39:30 - difficult when i say freelance work i
39:32 - mean
39:33 - going on up work and getting a job where
39:35 - you're actually building a web scraper
39:37 - for somebody
39:38 - going on fiverr and doing a job where so
39:41 - those are like more freelancing
39:42 - sometimes they're a little bit more
39:44 - difficult but
39:45 - if you stay with less technical
39:47 - freelance work that's not as
39:49 - technical then you can still do it that
39:51 - was the example i was giving you guys
39:52 - about squarespace and wix and card and
39:55 - wordpress and stuff like that okay so if
39:57 - you stayed at that side you can actually
39:59 - start that type of freelance work today
40:01 - as well
40:10 - all right and uh develop a habit of
40:12 - drinking water as well
40:14 - very important so i'm going to keep this
40:15 - water here because a lot of you it's
40:17 - going to make you want to drink it
40:19 - all right so drink water and
40:24 - on my apple watch i have a thing that i
40:27 - log
40:28 - i log it as soon as i drink water um
40:32 - that way i stay hydrated well and then
40:34 - do it
40:35 - all this stuff is extremely important
40:36 - guys because it's going to help you
40:37 - directly with making more money it's
40:39 - going to optimize your body
40:41 - your body is the ultimate asset you have
40:43 - that's going to optimize
40:44 - how you think how you act how you get
40:47 - clients how many clients you can retain
40:49 - gives you the energy to put up with
40:50 - people's [ __ ] right so
40:52 - it's an important thing
41:02 - all right and then the one we're not
41:05 - gonna worry about so much in november is
41:07 - a job
41:08 - um but if you get a job fantastic that's
41:11 - gonna be of course
41:12 - is gonna put the most amount of money um
41:15 - it depends
41:16 - i don't wanna ever get a job because i
41:17 - always love the freedom
41:19 - of freelancing but if you want to get a
41:21 - job you can do that
41:22 - all right so total income potential if
41:24 - you do all of these things is fifteen
41:26 - thousand dollars a month all right
41:28 - you can make about three thousand
41:29 - dollars a month or more from uh
41:31 - teaching i was making ten thousand
41:33 - dollars a month from teaching
41:34 - you can make five thousand dollars a
41:36 - month or more from
41:38 - freelancing i was making ten thousand
41:39 - dollars a month from freelancing
41:41 - and then you can make a bunch of money
41:43 - from my actual job all right so
41:46 - there if you do you can some people do
41:48 - all three sonny was doing like all three
41:50 - he was like coaching people and making
41:51 - an income he was doing freelancing work
41:53 - and he had a job
41:54 - so possible but for me it's
41:57 - i i personally like these two over here
42:00 - a lot more
42:02 - all right now where can i find clients
42:05 - that slash freelancing projects so if at
42:07 - this point you guys are excited about it
42:09 - well now when i get into where you guys
42:12 - can go and actually get this stuff
42:14 - fadal i have a we have a course called
42:17 - profit with javascript it shows you
42:19 - how to do all of this stuff if you guys
42:20 - want to get that course maybe it the
42:23 - link is in the description or maybe we
42:25 - have a free training right now in the
42:26 - description and you can go
42:27 - and sign up for that free training and
42:29 - it's going to go very deep into all this
42:31 - stuff
42:32 - and give you all the insights and it's
42:33 - pretty amazing training so if you want
42:35 - to do that go ahead
42:36 - i think there should be a free training
42:37 - in the description
42:40 - all right so here are the the platforms
42:42 - you can use to make more income so
42:43 - there's
42:44 - yzant you got take lessons you got
42:46 - people per hour
42:48 - um so i want to just share this with you
42:50 - guys and
42:51 - be as transparent as possible wise ant
42:53 - alone i was making about 80 grand
42:55 - a year from this this platform alone
42:59 - and all i was doing was teaching people
43:01 - coding all right and i had only three to
43:03 - six months of coding experience i just
43:05 - went hard on getting clients after
43:08 - clients after clients
43:09 - because there's a bajillion people that
43:12 - don't know how to code and are trying to
43:14 - learn there's a bajillion people that
43:16 - are
43:17 - trying to learn hello world and the
43:18 - basics of programming that don't
43:20 - understand there's bajillion people who
43:21 - are going to college
43:23 - but they don't actually understand the
43:24 - fundamentals
43:26 - so there are a ton of people that are at
43:29 - level one
43:30 - all right so once i got to like level
43:32 - two and three
43:34 - i just went maniac mode on
43:37 - working with and helping people move
43:39 - from a level one to level two and level
43:40 - three
43:41 - all right and it's a fair exchange
43:43 - because they're paying me and i'm
43:44 - helping them move forward in life i'm
43:46 - helping them develop a better skill so
43:48 - it's a totally
43:48 - fair and extremely valuable exchange on
43:51 - both directions
43:52 - they're giving me money i'm helping them
43:54 - save time does that make sense
43:56 - and time is much more important than
43:58 - money which is why it's a good deal for
44:00 - them
44:02 - so wiseand is a great platform to
44:05 - go and make a profile on and teach now a
44:07 - lot of you
44:08 - who are not in united states you cannot
44:10 - use why that
44:11 - you have to use something else all right
44:13 - take lessons is also
44:15 - another phenomenal platform that i used
44:17 - to make you know
44:18 - a lot of a lot of money i don't know i
44:20 - lost track on it but
44:21 - both of these platforms i was an
44:22 - instructor doing online lessons with
44:25 - people and teaching them coding
44:27 - all right and both of these combined i
44:29 - was making over
44:30 - 100 000 a year all right just from
44:33 - teaching coding all right so these are
44:37 - amazing platforms if you are in us
44:39 - these are for you if you're not in us
44:41 - i'll share some other resources with you
44:43 - all right people per hour is worldwide
44:47 - so you guys can go and apply to that
44:49 - today
44:50 - all i want you guys to think about right
44:52 - now is i don't want you to think about
44:55 - making
44:56 - i don't want you to think about making
44:57 - one thousand dollars i don't want you to
44:59 - think about making a hundred thousand
45:00 - dollars i don't want you to think about
45:01 - making ten thousand dollars
45:03 - if you haven't made a lot of money with
45:05 - coding
45:06 - or money with coding i want you to just
45:09 - think about how can you make ten dollars
45:10 - with coding
45:12 - do you think that you can make ten
45:14 - dollars this week from coding yes or no
45:17 - do you think that that's possible you
45:18 - can make ten dollars this week
45:20 - and even if you forget about the word
45:22 - coding and you just think can you make
45:24 - ten dollars from doing some kind of
45:25 - freelancing work
45:27 - this week ten dollars that's it
45:30 - not more if you make more that's a bonus
45:35 - and first don't think about how you're
45:37 - gonna do it just think
45:38 - is that possible for you to make ten
45:40 - dollars this week ten dollars more than
45:42 - you would normally make
45:52 - if you answered yes that means you have
45:54 - a good deal of self-confidence you
45:55 - believe that you can
45:56 - and that you believe that it's possible
46:01 - now if you believe that that's possible
46:03 - now we have to think about how can we
46:05 - actually make that happen
46:07 - if you can make 10 you're going to feel
46:09 - a momentum you're going to feel a win
46:10 - and you're going to then want to make 15
46:12 - and then you're going to
46:13 - want to make 20 okay so i want you to
46:15 - start off with the smallest possible
46:17 - thing because if you can do it in a way
46:19 - where you're curious and excited and
46:21 - happy
46:21 - and you feel a win i already know you're
46:23 - going to be going bigger and bigger and
46:25 - bigger and bigger
46:26 - but if all you do is think about that
46:27 - ten thousand then even if you make ten
46:28 - dollars today you're not going to be
46:30 - happy
46:30 - enough or go long term enough to make
46:33 - the ten thousand does that make sense
46:35 - so when you're thinking about your goals
46:38 - i'm gonna teach you how to do short term
46:39 - goal thinking as well because i see
46:41 - a lot of people [ __ ] up and live unhappy
46:44 - lives
46:44 - because their goals are [ __ ] absurd
46:46 - their goals are just dumb
46:48 - so i'm going to show you guys this okay
46:51 - um
46:52 - so let's say you got this long-term goal
46:54 - right here right you want to make 10k
46:57 - in one month well if that's your goal
47:00 - and that's your only goal well guess
47:02 - what when you make five dollars and ten
47:03 - dollars a hundred dollars and thousand
47:05 - dollars and
47:05 - two thousand and three thousand and four
47:07 - thousand you're never going to be happy
47:09 - on any of these months
47:10 - you're never going to be happy never
47:12 - going to be happy never going to be
47:13 - happy not going to be happy because
47:14 - you're
47:15 - not going to be happy look at how many
47:18 - opportunities you're setting yourself up
47:19 - to be
47:20 - unhappy unhappy let's just say sad
47:25 - right look at how many opportunities
47:26 - you're setting up for yourself to be
47:27 - happy
47:28 - are you going to live a happy life or a
47:29 - sad life
47:33 - you're [ __ ] yourself over you're
47:35 - setting yourself up to live a unhappy
47:38 - life right look at how many rules there
47:41 - are
47:41 - to be upset and frustrated and
47:44 - disappointed
47:46 - are you ever gonna then go up to the 10k
47:48 - goal
47:50 - absolutely not absolutely not
47:53 - how i live my life is everything feels
47:56 - like a bonus
47:57 - i set my expectations to be like
47:59 - negative like literally almost negative
48:02 - like like awful
48:05 - but then i play like i'm playing for
48:07 - making 10 million this month
48:09 - so my actions are like i'm playing for
48:11 - 10 million but my expectation is
48:13 - i don't deserve dick and i if i made if
48:16 - i broke even this month i would be
48:18 - extremely happy just break even with no
48:21 - profit with no new income i'd be
48:22 - extremely happy
48:24 - so then what happens is if i make one
48:26 - thousand dollars more i'm more happy
48:27 - when i make
48:28 - two thousand more i'm more happy if i
48:30 - make a hundred thousand more that month
48:31 - i am million times happy
48:35 - so set more rules to be happy that's how
48:37 - you're gonna get to those goals so now
48:39 - i want you to flip this and go happy
48:43 - on these and then be happier
48:46 - on that does that make sense
48:50 - no look at that so if you set up rules
48:53 - like that in your life well then you're
48:55 - setting yourself
48:56 - up for a happy life and extreme amounts
48:59 - of success does that make sense
49:01 - so that's how i want you to set it up
49:02 - okay so i want you to be excited
49:05 - out of your mind about making ten
49:07 - dollars
49:08 - this upcoming week
49:13 - and sean says let's see
49:17 - yes i can beautiful
49:20 - authoriva says as a beginner it's
49:22 - difficult but i'm ready to put in those
49:23 - efforts
49:25 - yep i can make a hundred dollars with
49:28 - html
49:29 - nashat says yes i can beautiful
49:34 - i took ten dollars out of my brother's
49:36 - wallet gold achieved
49:37 - so probably not like that yes yes yes
49:41 - joshua says time to make this happen
49:43 - okay beautiful
49:46 - so people per hour is a great platform
49:49 - for you guys to go and start applying
49:52 - all right now i want you guys to
49:54 - keep the goal in mind of making ten
49:56 - dollars this week so keep a small goal
49:58 - even if it means you're doing something
50:00 - underpriced that's okay right now it's
50:01 - all about getting that first momentum
50:03 - the first five or ten dollars this week
50:05 - and every single person that makes any
50:07 - amount of income i want you to dm me on
50:10 - instagram this is my instagram at
50:12 - cleverkazy go click that and like follow
50:14 - me there right now because i'm like
50:16 - putting all stories and i'm going hard
50:18 - on instagram and it's gonna transform
50:20 - your life if you follow the follow my
50:22 - instagram
50:23 - and i want you to send me proof of your
50:26 - income
50:27 - if you do send me proof of income that
50:29 - you're making i'm
50:31 - manually going to be logging it in an
50:33 - excel sheet
50:34 - and i'm going to have your name there
50:35 - how much income you you made the proof
50:37 - of your income
50:38 - and i want to collectively keep a track
50:40 - of how much income we're all making
50:42 - together does that make sense so every
50:43 - single person that makes income
50:45 - i want documented proof and i want to
50:47 - track it are you guys with me on that
50:50 - are you with me on that as
50:53 - many people as i have to document i will
50:55 - do that
50:56 - manually and then i will want to share
50:59 - with you guys every single week
51:00 - the results and how much wealth we've
51:02 - accumulated together
51:04 - that's exciting right so even if you
51:06 - accumulated five dollars well guess what
51:08 - you're helping the rest of the group
51:09 - because now their number is five dollars
51:12 - more than it was before
51:13 - so you're not just gonna help yourself
51:14 - you're gonna help the overall group
51:16 - together
51:17 - all right so i think this is a very
51:19 - exciting opportunity and i hope you are
51:21 - excited about this as well
51:23 - rohit says yes i'm in and creation is
51:26 - excited nikita dope enough says yes i'm
51:28 - in pinoy says great mindset so even if
51:30 - it's not for yourself it's for other
51:32 - people right so
51:33 - small is better guys small is better
51:36 - because i promise
51:37 - if you focus on the biggest goal it's
51:39 - going to demoralize you and not do it
51:41 - you can think about it and get excited
51:43 - about it but just focus on the
51:44 - extremely small win and set that as your
51:47 - expectation and then
51:48 - work like a [ __ ] work like a
51:50 - workhorse
51:51 - so ten dollars is our goal okay this
51:53 - week ten
51:54 - dollars is our goal code mentor is
51:57 - another platform
51:59 - and what does this mean like literally
52:01 - put up your profile and say i'll charge
52:03 - you five dollars or one dollar and then
52:05 - help 10 people and now you've made ten
52:07 - dollars
52:08 - here same thing charge ten dollars an
52:10 - hour ten dollars an hour if you can get
52:12 - on any of these platforms
52:14 - craigslist is another platform okay and
52:17 - this should be worldwide for everybody
52:19 - you can be like hey i'll help you get
52:20 - better in coding and i'll give you
52:22 - a free session you can start off with
52:24 - that and then charge them or you can say
52:26 - hey i'll charge you 10 bucks for 20
52:27 - bucks
52:28 - for a session i don't care if you have
52:30 - to go cheap i just
52:32 - care that you get wins and a momentum of
52:34 - winning and a momentum of people paying
52:36 - you and you're doing sessions
52:37 - all right victor says i'm in goalless
52:40 - 500
52:41 - made app earlier for 1k but it took me
52:43 - way too long to build got me a dev job
52:46 - though keep that in mind guys that's
52:48 - awesome victor thanks for sharing that
52:51 - that's awesome all right you guys can go
52:55 - on
52:55 - linkedin and reach out to people okay so
52:57 - that's one that's another way
52:59 - these ways i really really like because
53:02 - people are gonna reach out to you for
53:03 - job
53:04 - postings or you can apply this is a
53:06 - great way too but
53:08 - uh so i'm just gonna keep mentioning all
53:10 - of them okay this
53:11 - means you are reaching out to a ton of
53:13 - people are interested in coding and you
53:14 - can be like hey
53:15 - i'd love to help you learn coding you
53:18 - can reach out to people on instagram so
53:20 - you can go to a coding channel
53:22 - on instagram and then look at their
53:24 - followers and see if you can help their
53:26 - followers don't
53:26 - spam and be annoying but like actually
53:29 - care and leave a message that
53:31 - shows that you care so for example one
53:34 - hack that i have for freelancing that's
53:36 - like incredible
53:37 - is it's all about building relationship
53:38 - and trust then the money part is easy
53:41 - right so
53:42 - for example what you can do is go leave
53:45 - the first message
53:46 - never leave it with the question and
53:48 - don't make it too long
53:49 - may it should be like one line or two
53:51 - lines max
53:52 - okay and it should be a statement and
53:55 - you shouldn't ask for anything from the
53:57 - other person
53:58 - so for example if you want to build a
53:59 - relationship with somebody start it off
54:01 - with
54:03 - i just saw your instagram profile i
54:06 - absolutely love your last post or i
54:07 - absolutely love
54:08 - the two posts ago when you were talking
54:10 - about you know drinking a cup of coffee
54:13 - in um in la or you know
54:18 - where you talked about i'm sitting at
54:19 - starbucks eating eggs and cheese protein
54:22 - box
54:22 - whatever that thing is that maybe
54:24 - resonated with you
54:25 - or that post was genuinely talk about
54:28 - that
54:29 - and say that was amazing and then just
54:31 - leave it at that
54:32 - so you're not asking for anything so
54:34 - you're not coming off
54:36 - slimy or sleazy or salesy
54:39 - you're literally just providing value
54:41 - and building the relationship
54:43 - then when the conversation starts you
54:45 - can then go and talk about hey are you
54:48 - what are you doing with coding i noticed
54:50 - that you're coding
54:51 - and then as the transition goes more
54:53 - towards them they're like yeah i'm a
54:54 - beginner i'm just starting
54:56 - be like i'd love to get on a 30-minute
54:58 - call with you or i would love to get on
55:00 - a short call with you and talk about
55:01 - your
55:02 - goals with coding that person would be
55:04 - like hell yeah i'd love to and then you
55:06 - can
55:06 - get on a call with them talk to them
55:08 - about coding
55:09 - and then say hey uh if you want and if
55:12 - you're okay with
55:13 - it i can help you for a fee
55:16 - let me know if you're interested in
55:17 - hearing more if they're like yeah i'm
55:18 - interested in hearing more go okay
55:21 - i will only charge you like five dollars
55:23 - for the first session i'll only charge
55:25 - you ten dollars for a one hour session
55:27 - and i think i can help you with this
55:29 - this and this and if they're like yeah
55:31 - that works
55:31 - then great you just made ten dollars all
55:34 - right that's freaking exciting
55:36 - and you can share that with me and i'll
55:38 - document it and add it now you got
55:40 - momentum
55:41 - now you're building good habits that
55:42 - help you towards it right
55:44 - why do you work out every day or why do
55:48 - people do that it's just a habit that
55:49 - helps them move forward build muscle
55:51 - and get better in life it's a habit that
55:53 - they develop if you want to increase
55:55 - income
55:56 - you got to develop habits around income
55:58 - things that you do on a regular basis
56:00 - that you start enjoying ritualistically
56:03 - and do them
56:04 - all right that's going to make your
56:06 - habit make your income go higher and
56:08 - higher every single
56:09 - day all right there are facebook groups
56:12 - you can be a part of
56:13 - you can go to upwork that's another
56:15 - great great platform and what i would
56:17 - say is literally try to find jobs for
56:19 - five dollars and ten dollars and be like
56:20 - i'll do it for ten dollars i'll do it
56:22 - for five dollars
56:23 - i want you to develop the muscle of
56:26 - somebody giving you money and then
56:27 - you're doing something that exchange
56:31 - freelancer.com is another great great
56:33 - platform so you can write that one down
56:35 - and go to that one all right and of
56:38 - course
56:39 - this all you can do working from home so
56:42 - you can literally be in your bed
56:44 - like this lazy dog have a blanket on
56:46 - yourself
56:47 - and make profiles on all of these
56:49 - platforms today
56:51 - and get started on all of this today or
56:54 - even just one of this today so let me
56:57 - ask you
56:59 - because otherwise we would both be
57:01 - wasting each other's time
57:03 - what is one thing you're going to commit
57:05 - to doing today that's going to help you
57:07 - move forward with your income what's one
57:10 - thing that you're going gonna do today
57:12 - right today that's gonna help you move
57:15 - forward
57:16 - with your income goals write that down
57:18 - in
57:19 - the live chat on youtube and then i will
57:22 - actually
57:23 - share that with people and i'm gonna
57:26 - read it out loud here
57:31 - and when you make income send it as a
57:33 - proof on instagram and i will share that
57:34 - too every single week with everybody
57:41 - nikhil says just joined people per hour
57:44 - that's
57:44 - incredible
57:49 - nusaat says your words are full of
57:51 - motivation i'm going to meet you one day
57:53 - awesome pushkar says make a profile on
57:57 - people per
57:58 - hour amazing
58:02 - because otherwise what are you doing
58:04 - with your time why are you even here
58:06 - on this video if you're not going to
58:08 - take some action
58:10 - on what has happened today one of the
58:12 - things i hate the most in life is when i
58:13 - watch something or learn something and i
58:15 - don't take action on it
58:17 - like that makes me despise myself in
58:19 - that moment so
58:21 - always am like because otherwise just
58:25 - disrespect to the person who wrote the
58:26 - book or who shared the advice and is a
58:28 - disrespect to you and your time
58:31 - so if you are here you're here for a
58:34 - reason
58:35 - and if you are watching a video that's
58:37 - called how to make
58:38 - more income as a freelance developer
58:41 - then it only makes sense that you
58:43 - actually commit to a certain goal
58:44 - because it's going to help
58:45 - you get there all right and the more
58:48 - specific your goal the more likely you
58:49 - are to do it
58:50 - like for example i'll give an example
58:52 - mando rodriguez
58:54 - says register register register so i
58:56 - love that but that goal is not specific
58:57 - enough which it means that
59:00 - he's likely to not do it but i
59:03 - do want him to do it and i feel like
59:04 - mando you'll do it and that would be
59:06 - amazing
59:07 - because then tomorrow or the day a few
59:09 - days later you can share that with me
59:10 - but make it specific because then i know
59:13 - you guys are going to do it
59:15 - okay eshwari says done making profile on
59:19 - people per hour enthusiast says just
59:20 - create a profile people per hour
59:22 - awesome guys when you make the profile
59:24 - on these types of platforms make sure
59:26 - you put a picture of you smiling okay
59:28 - i'll show you how to smile
59:32 - take a picture with your phone all right
59:34 - so we can take this picture together we
59:36 - can take this picture
59:37 - right now so for example just go
59:41 - pop this open bad boy open like this
59:47 - all right this is a great
59:51 - photo this is what a great photo looks
59:53 - like
59:54 - you don't need this fancy setup
59:57 - uh you guys you guys you guys see it
60:00 - take that is the photo that should go on
60:03 - these profiles okay people have too many
60:05 - weird photos and too creepy and just
60:09 - don't this is not the time to be cute
60:11 - this is the time to just have a simple
60:13 - friendly
60:14 - smiling photo a smiling friendly
60:17 - warm welcoming photo will do wonders for
60:20 - you will literally make you hundreds of
60:22 - thousands of dollars
60:24 - in your life it's crazy so that is going
60:28 - to help you
60:28 - and actually make your profile stand out
60:32 - from a lot of them at first i was
60:33 - worried about this stream might be for
60:35 - the big boys
60:36 - but then i feel good because i can such
60:38 - a short-term goal of five dollars per
60:40 - week and i could do that
60:42 - awesome i think you're good for me to
60:44 - make my life better with income
60:45 - awesome tricky places gonna make a
60:48 - profile on each website
60:49 - amazing that's what i want to hear
60:51 - people taking actions and
60:53 - us creating transformations all right
60:55 - that's the whole goal
60:57 - of why we're actually starting this
60:59 - movement and why i've started the
61:00 - freelancing movement right
61:02 - and here are wins from our students
61:04 - which i think i've already shared with
61:05 - you guys
61:07 - um but these are the countries that
61:11 - are all paying a good amount of
61:14 - money per month for developers
61:17 - all right and usa canada united kingdom
61:20 - germany right so
61:22 - it doesn't matter where you are in the
61:23 - world it's possible for you to get a job
61:25 - in usa you can be literally anywhere
61:27 - but you could get a job in usa united
61:29 - kingdom germany or canada
61:32 - and remember these seven important
61:35 - habits to get you there okay so
61:37 - do it in a way or short term it's fun
61:40 - fun
61:40 - is an extremely important thing guys
61:44 - because without this you're very
61:46 - unlikely to
61:47 - like if your goal is this fun will help
61:51 - you with all of this
61:54 - fun will help you all right because you
61:57 - can't
61:57 - always just like do it with patience you
61:59 - know like if i was like okay
62:01 - i want you to just look at a wall for
62:04 - for the next
62:07 - 10 months and just like do nothing
62:10 - like maybe you can just eat you're
62:12 - allowed to eat and use the bathroom
62:14 - but you have to sit in one spot and look
62:16 - at a wall for 10 months and then i said
62:18 - i'll literally give you one million
62:20 - not a single person in here will do that
62:23 - even if they were promised to get one
62:25 - million at the end of it
62:26 - nobody will do that so i think patience
62:29 - and all that stuff is great
62:31 - but if it's not fun along the way you're
62:33 - not going to
62:34 - want to do it all right so
62:38 - make sure that you go ahead and
62:42 - make the thing fun for yourself short
62:44 - term so how can it be fun
62:46 - put all these apps like people per hour
62:49 - p
62:49 - uh upwork fiverr even if it
62:52 - put all of these apps on your home
62:54 - screen on your phone all right because
62:56 - if that's
62:56 - gonna help you move forward in life put
62:59 - that on the front screen and in the next
63:01 - live stream i think i'm going to talk
63:02 - about net worth and some stuff like that
63:04 - too which will be important
63:06 - if you guys want you can download an app
63:07 - called personal capital on your phones
63:09 - and we can talk about that next time if
63:11 - you have it set up then it
63:12 - will make a lot more sense but add these
63:15 - apps
63:16 - to your front screen and then
63:20 - kind of like how you view facebook and
63:22 - instagram just lightly go and have fun
63:24 - and look at these apps
63:26 - and see what kind of job opportunities
63:27 - are here just kick back relax have a cup
63:29 - of coffee and be like
63:30 - oh this is cute this is fun i'll just
63:32 - apply to this
63:34 - make it a thing where it's fun for your
63:36 - brain to do it
63:37 - consume content around freelancing the
63:39 - more you brainwash yourself around
63:41 - freelancing
63:42 - and making an income the more your body
63:45 - and soul is going to want to do it
63:47 - but if you're consuming other things
63:50 - that are not related to this your body
63:52 - and soul is not going to want to do this
63:54 - which is going to turn it into a very
63:55 - painful task
63:57 - so make it in a way where it's actually
64:00 - fun for you
64:01 - all right of course hard work patience
64:04 - is going to play off this is going to
64:06 - pay off learning is going to pay off but
64:09 - i want you guys to focus on these a lot
64:11 - right make it fun for yourself
64:13 - and take initiative so get started
