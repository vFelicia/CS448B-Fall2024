00:01 - all right folks today we got an exciting
00:04 - video ahead large language models as is
00:08 - the end of programming this is a talk by
00:11 - Dr Matt Welsh that took place at
00:16 - cs50 I've been wanting to watch this
00:18 - video for a while but I was holding
00:20 - myself off from watching it because I
00:22 - want to watch it with you guys and react
00:24 - to it with you guys because I think this
00:27 - is going to be amazing so I'm really
00:28 - excited to watch it so it's going to be
00:30 - real time we're going to watch it
00:32 - together and I'm going to break down my
00:33 - thoughts
00:34 - on whether the end of programming is
00:37 - here or not and what my thoughts are on
00:39 - that so with that said let's just jump
00:40 - right into it and before we begin I do
00:44 - want to let you know that if you want to
00:47 - learn how to build apps with Chad GPT
00:51 - and Ai and learn how to use that to make
00:53 - money in as little as eight weeks with
00:56 - those skills like a bunch of my students
00:58 - have like Naza who's in the course right
01:02 - now that within 30 minutes of joining he
01:04 - actually built his first app so if you
01:05 - want to be able to learn those types of
01:07 - things I put together a free training
01:09 - for you where I'll give you three AI SAS
01:13 - app ideas that you could actually build
01:15 - this week I'll also show you the best
01:19 - ways where you can build an app
01:21 - production ready app that would have
01:23 - taken people months and how you could
01:25 - actually do that within a couple of
01:28 - days all of that stuff and more in the
01:31 - free training that I've put together for
01:32 - you so go ahead click the link below and
01:34 - sign up for that free training with that
01:36 - said let's
01:38 - continue so I'm here to tell you that
01:42 - the field of computer science is
01:47 - doomed that's a banger okay um and and I
01:52 - actually kind of mean this although I'm
01:53 - going to put it in somewhat humorous
01:55 - terms that uh if you think about
01:58 - computer science what is the field about
02:00 - what does it mean where did it before he
02:02 - even continues I just want to add
02:05 - here like let's see where he's going to
02:07 - go with it right but look at that
02:10 - translating ideas into program that's
02:14 - what computer science has always been
02:17 - about and so if you go back in the day
02:20 - before it was playing with logic gates
02:22 - directly then we went to a higher level
02:25 - language which was like assembly and
02:28 - then after assembly
02:30 - we got higher level languages like Java
02:34 - and then we started getting languages
02:36 - like JavaScript and Python and so if you
02:40 - look we kept going higher and higher
02:42 - level than bits and
02:44 - bytes so just just like just pure
02:48 - sheer
02:51 - logic think through that think through
02:54 - the evolution of vehicles and Technology
02:57 - automotive technology you
03:01 - had people
03:03 - walking then you had people probably
03:06 - trying to ride a [ __ ] Turtle
03:07 - realizing you can't ride it [ __ ]
03:09 - somebody's probably tried to ride a
03:10 - cheetah and lions and they died and
03:12 - somebody tried to ride a rhinocerus and
03:14 - died and finally they figured out that
03:16 - horse is the thing that you can ride
03:18 - like how insane do you have to be right
03:20 - to try that like who the [ __ ] was the
03:21 - first person to discover that a horse
03:23 - could be rode and trained like so many
03:26 - people died probably just trying to
03:28 - figure that out and then you had horses
03:31 - and then you had the next level up which
03:34 - ended up becoming like these carriages
03:36 - you could just sit inside the carriage
03:37 - while the horse dragged it and then
03:40 - horsepower and the thought of the
03:42 - carriages and the horses and they're
03:43 - like what if we could just turn it where
03:44 - it doesn't even need a horse and then it
03:46 - turned into Automobiles and then
03:48 - automobiles were like this great thing
03:50 - and then we discovered I don't know what
03:52 - the order of it is right but like we
03:53 - discovered trains at some point and we
03:55 - figured out airplanes at some point and
03:56 - we just figured out faster and faster
03:58 - and better travel
04:01 - before you have to swim and they figured
04:02 - out boats and so I just think about it
04:04 - like that logic gates assembly
04:07 - JavaScript
04:09 - AI right and the idea of AI is turning
04:13 - natural language ideas into programs so
04:16 - that's just what I'm thinking let's keep
04:20 - going come from what is it what's the
04:23 - core idea of it it's the idea of taking
04:26 - an idea an algorithm or a concept or a
04:28 - data structure and translating it into a
04:31 - program that can generally be run by
04:34 - like a Von noyman architecture machine
04:36 - right okay so that's computer science in
04:38 - a
04:39 - nutshell the problem is that um the the
04:45 - goal of Cs has always had this kind of
04:48 - core fundamental assumption or Axiom
04:52 - that is that the programs that we're all
04:54 - talking about here have been implemented
04:57 - maintained and have to be under
04:59 - understood by
05:01 - humans right that if I print out the
05:03 - code for a
05:05 - program a human some human maybe not
05:07 - everyone but at least maybe the person
05:09 - who wrote it if not someone else can
05:12 - understand
05:13 - it now here's humans suck at all three
05:16 - of these things we're terrible at
05:18 - writing programs we're terrible at
05:20 - maintaining them and we're absolutely
05:21 - terrible at understanding
05:23 - them so what does that really mean for
05:27 - the
05:28 - field so I want to make this claim that
05:32 - 50 years of research into programming
05:36 - languages has done effectively
05:39 - nothing to solve this
05:41 - problem we've been at this for a long
05:44 - time now 50 years is a long time and we
05:47 - keep inventing new languages and new
05:48 - programming Concepts and new
05:50 - abstractions and new data types and new
05:52 - proof method
05:55 - methodologies
05:57 - but so what does this mean this means
06:00 - that remember before we had
06:02 - JavaScript we had Java right and we had
06:05 - all these other languages we had
06:06 - assembly and then it was like okay we
06:08 - need to take assembly and make it easier
06:10 - so humans can write a easier if then
06:13 - statement than figuring out where to
06:15 - allocate memory for this if Den
06:19 - statement and so we got higher level and
06:21 - then it became
06:23 - easier and then we went even more higher
06:26 - level right with JavaScript and python
06:27 - Etc but basically his point is that th
06:31 - that 50 years has effectively done
06:34 - nothing we got typescript and we got
06:37 - react to make JavaScript easier and then
06:40 - we got next to even make that easier and
06:42 - then there's a framework for every
06:45 - single thing angular and while these are
06:49 - leaps and incremental improvements and
06:52 - it does make programming easier these
06:54 - are not Quantum
06:57 - leaps I think that's what he's trying to
06:59 - say here particularly right no amount of
07:03 - improvement to type systems debugging
07:05 - static analysis lynches or documentation
07:06 - is going to magically solve this problem
07:09 - is the idea here new solve this problem
07:12 - and I don't think another 50 years is
07:14 - going to solve
07:15 - it I think we've this idea of building
07:20 - automated tools to help humans write
07:22 - better software has played itself out
07:27 - valid now if you disagree with me let's
07:29 - just take a look at kind of the history
07:31 - here so let's rewind the clock all the
07:33 - way back to 1957 this is Conway's Game
07:36 - of Life implemented in Fortran I don't
07:38 - remember which dialect of Fortran this
07:40 - is but you know Fortran came about in
07:41 - about
07:44 - 1957 I I just claim this is really hard
07:46 - to understand
07:49 - I yeah that
07:52 - um let me see if I can try to understand
07:55 - this so do something 200 times between
07:58 - the range of 1 and
08:01 - 10,000 I don't know if that's right or
08:04 - not call off Tech if CD 7. eq. one4 go
08:11 - to 300 holy [ __ ] yeah I'm I'm lost
08:14 - there's something like database type
08:17 - that I
08:18 - see uh
08:20 - here database type yeah I'm kind of lost
08:24 - I mean I I see if and else if and else
08:26 - and then that has a nested if and all
08:28 - that and then continue but yeah it's
08:31 - real real hard to understand what's
08:33 - happening and I imagine it's something
08:34 - you're kind of doing at a pretty low
08:38 - level I I just claim this is really hard
08:40 - to understand I I claim that you can't
08:43 - look at this and unless you had some
08:44 - idea of the intent of the programmer
08:46 - what the hell does this do you could
08:48 - work it out you could spend some time
08:50 - reading it you could probably understand
08:52 - it with some effort but it's not trivial
08:54 - it's not
08:55 - straightforward yeah his point is that
08:59 - regardless of how nicely the code is
09:01 - written it still takes time to
09:04 - understand the logic of
09:05 - it and how it's working so there's still
09:08 - a lot of computational processing
09:10 - required for our brains and our brains
09:13 - aren't very good at that for humans our
09:14 - brain strength is creative
09:17 - thinking computers are really good at
09:20 - that okay so we tried to make program by
09:23 - that I me meant programming and logic
09:26 - programming easier we came up with
09:27 - something called basic in 19
09:29 - 64 this is not the original basic again
09:32 - it's had many dialects because obviously
09:33 - the first one wasn't good enough we had
09:35 - to keep improving the language that [ __ ]
09:36 - looks
09:38 - nasty this is the same program in
09:41 - basic I don't think this is any easier
09:43 - to
09:44 - understand okay I could spend some time
09:47 - reading it and convince myself that it
09:48 - does a certain thing but it's quite
09:50 - challenging to get
09:53 - so that is nasty if I if I had to start
09:55 - programming like that I would be pretty
09:58 - offut by
10:00 - programming then we came up with
10:03 - APL this is Conway's Game of Life and
10:07 - APL I would say raise your hand if you
10:09 - understand this but I know there's
10:10 - probably a few people in the audience
10:11 - who
10:13 - do I don't right this is a programming
10:16 - language so complex you needed a special
10:18 - keyboard to type it okay but this is
10:21 - what we
10:22 - thought was the practice of developing
10:24 - programming languages back in the 60s
10:27 - was this certainly a doesn't do the job
10:30 - all right well I've been talking about
10:32 - stuff that's kind of old fashioned what
10:33 - about the the new hotness let's talk
10:35 - about rust everybody's programming in
10:37 - Rust it's the latest and greatest thing
10:39 - since sliced bread I spent two years
10:40 - running engineering at a startup that
10:42 - was completely rust based I ran a big
10:43 - team full of rust developers I actually
10:45 - learned rust myself kind of this is the
10:48 - same program in Rust I don't make heads
10:49 - or
10:52 - taals yeah so basically he's like I'm
10:55 - not making heads or tails of this so he
10:57 - also has similar problem problem with
10:59 - this and yeah I mean even though you got
11:02 - some functions that make things nicer
11:04 - right you got functional programming you
11:06 - got a filter you're mapping through
11:07 - things and you got something happening
11:10 - here and you got a you know function
11:13 - called generation and you have it
11:16 - returns a colony class type or Colony
11:19 - type something along those lines like
11:21 - this here returns a
11:22 - hashmap and so we have somewhat
11:26 - understanding of this like we're making
11:28 - a new hash M here but do I really know
11:31 - what every single thing is happening and
11:33 - if I try to figure it out it would take
11:34 - a long time you know like the [ __ ] is
11:37 - going on here bro asterisk and sense.
11:41 - entry like what is
11:43 - that
11:45 - um and yeah I mean I have not really
11:48 - played around with rust but like you
11:50 - could there's some Java scriptin to it
11:54 - and a little bit of how it's written or
11:56 - some Ruess into it but
11:59 - ultimately it's still like hard to
12:01 - understand of
12:03 - this it is incredibly hard to write
12:07 - programs that are easy to understand
12:09 - easy to maintain easy to reason about
12:12 - okay so that's the kind of
12:15 - state-of-the-art this is where we've
12:16 - gotten in 50 years from Fortran to this
12:18 - and I just want to make the claim that
12:19 - this is not this is not going to work
12:22 - okay we're done game over so what's next
12:25 - I love this guy well this is how I write
12:27 - code today let's go
12:30 - this is a prompt passed to the GPT for I
12:34 - get so much [ __ ] hate if I showed
12:38 - you let's go to my Instagram and I just
12:40 - want to show you the hate I get like
12:41 - look at this this is a post I made where
12:43 - I said programming will be dead soon and
12:45 - I said 2028 now it might be 2032 2035
12:50 - but the idea is that I do think that
12:53 - coding as we know it is going to be dead
12:54 - and it's going to be something different
12:56 - meaning that it might turn more into
12:58 - prom engineering and idea generation and
13:00 - like you could see the hate that I got
13:02 - right influencers what you influencers
13:04 - get by creating unnecessary chaos among
13:06 - the community you guys are screaming
13:08 - like if you don't know or don't follow
13:10 - this you will be dead this video is a
13:13 - reason to unfollow you let's go look at
13:15 - find all the nasty negative comments God
13:19 - damn this is so untrue and very
13:21 - misleading so true unfollowed with
13:24 - pleasure LOL and the list just goes on
13:27 - right I made another post talking about
13:29 - all the negative
13:30 - comments that we got on this and so much
13:34 - hate and here's what I have to say to
13:36 - that right you can choose to be uh what
13:40 - do they call it you could choose to be
13:42 - um duck and put your head in the sand
13:46 - and just mute everything out and just be
13:47 - like everything is going to be fine but
13:49 - here's the thing all these programmers
13:51 - that are cuddled up in a circle jerk
13:53 - right now crying in my comment section
13:56 - of my posts telling me that they're
13:59 - unfollowing Me by leaving a comment and
14:02 - then and then probably unfollowing or
14:04 - probably not even unfollowing still
14:05 - following so they could just watch from
14:06 - the distance and [ __ ]
14:08 - hate here's the
14:10 - thing that's coping mechanism kicking in
14:15 - hard and I'm not trying to spread my
14:18 - idea isn't to spread chaos and fear so
14:22 - everybody just frightened is like oh
14:24 - [ __ ] I'm just mentioning the reality bro
14:26 - like this is what is happen
14:29 - happening this is how I'm writing my
14:31 - [ __ ] code I me I built a production
14:36 - ready app last month in one month with
14:40 - 100 to 150 hours of coding all by myself
14:44 - and that was something that before I
14:45 - would have had to pay three to six
14:47 - developers to do over 3 months and paid
14:48 - 60 Grand and I know because I've done
14:51 - that if you look at my
14:54 - channel oh the guy doesn't does this guy
14:57 - know really what he's talking talking
14:59 - about this this really know what he's
15:01 - talking about look at this I literally
15:05 - every [ __ ] day would build these apps
15:07 - who else do you know is building these
15:08 - app for 6 hours 8 hours 10 hours in a
15:10 - row we have so many apps that we've
15:12 - built and these were live We Built these
15:15 - live these aren't even all the other
15:17 - recorded videos that we've done so
15:20 - like it's not like I'm I'm building
15:22 - software for the first
15:24 - time and just some random influencer
15:27 - yeah there's ton of [ __ ] random
15:28 - influencers but like bro like look at
15:31 - who's talking to you I've been doing
15:32 - this for 7 to 8 years my first year in
15:35 - coding I learned it started making 100
15:37 - Grand a year and then I kept scaling it
15:40 - from there so it's like I understand
15:42 - coding I get what you guys are saying I
15:44 - understand now let me address the hate
15:46 - too the the reason why I'm getting that
15:48 - hate is because people are scared and
15:51 - Afraid and maybe I'm leaning into it way
15:53 - too [ __ ] hard and maybe I need to
15:55 - change the tonality and maybe show more
15:57 - compassion but I'm trying to wake you
15:59 - the [ __ ] up because if you are not
16:02 - listening you're going to get wrecked
16:04 - and my point is you need to learn the
16:06 - new technologies and the new way of
16:08 - doing things so if you're not doing this
16:10 - meaning going and talking to Chad GPT to
16:12 - build out your programs and working with
16:14 - it or know how to do that you're [ __ ]
16:17 - behind here's a tweet by amjed mad the
16:22 - founder of
16:23 - repet okay repet just in case you don't
16:25 - know
16:27 - it and in amount of people are using it
16:29 - it's a valuation of this company is at a
16:31 - billion dollars it's a pretty big
16:33 - company and he's a founder of this
16:34 - company and he wrote this tweet on May
16:38 - 18th at a hackathon where a winner and
16:41 - this tweet got 1.2 million views right
16:44 - at hackathon where a winner is non-
16:46 - Technic a non-technical PM product
16:48 - manager and her work powered by repet
16:51 - plus AI is more technically impressive
16:53 - than teams of Engineers was surprised at
16:56 - first but it struck me that PMS must be
16:58 - exceptional prompting after all that is
17:01 - their
17:02 - job so I'm not telling you some random
17:07 - Theory stuff this is
17:10 - happening 9 months ago or eight months
17:13 - ago whatever whenever you're watching
17:15 - this it's January 2024 right
17:18 - now this is happening this is the truth
17:21 - this is the reality the person that won
17:24 - is not technical do you understand that
17:27 - the people that are freaking the [ __ ]
17:28 - out right now all technical people so
17:30 - either you can go into coping mechanism
17:32 - and regress and die off after a couple
17:34 - of years get replaced by these product
17:36 - managers who will output five times you
17:38 - don't need you will do it for sense and
17:41 - you'll be sitting there [ __ ] broke
17:42 - and
17:44 - useless
17:45 - or on the other
17:48 - side you can learn how to use these
17:50 - tools so you can learn to be thise
17:52 - effective she made this happen and made
17:55 - that project happen because she could
17:57 - prompt engineer it
17:58 - and she knew the vision of the project
18:00 - and then she worked with AI to make it a
18:02 - reality and that's where we're headed
18:04 - where ideas are being translated into
18:07 - programs so that's all I'm saying all
18:10 - right let's keep on going model and it's
18:14 - part of a larger program that reads in
18:16 - some text of a transcript that's been
18:19 - derived from a podcast audio feed we're
18:21 - feeding the transcript into the model
18:23 - and we're giving it these instructions
18:24 - we're saying please summarize the
18:26 - following segment of this podcast
18:28 - transcript only use the information in
18:30 - the text do not in caps this is
18:33 - important by the way the all caps is
18:34 - super important do not use any
18:36 - information you know about the world
18:37 - include the title of the podcast the
18:39 - name of the episode and the names of the
18:41 - speakers if
18:42 - known this English statement here
18:46 - encodes an algorithm it describes
18:49 - something that I want to do with an
18:51 - input data and the output data that I
18:53 - want and my expectations about the kind
18:55 - of thing that's in the output data
18:58 - there's a few things to notice about
18:59 - this the first thing to notice about
19:00 - this is I don't think anyone could ever
19:03 - write down the algorithm for what this
19:06 - is supposed to do in any existing
19:08 - programming language or any programming
19:10 - language that we're likely to come up
19:11 - with in the
19:12 - future how do you write this
19:16 - algorithm wait
19:19 - really is that
19:21 - true that's crazy can you not write this
19:24 - hold on let me just think about
19:27 - it okay provide a one or two sentence
19:30 - summary so that we
19:33 - could probably do with an algorithm send
19:35 - it off to an AI and it could summarize
19:37 - text so that's possible only use the
19:39 - information provided in the
19:42 - text huh that's kind of hard I don't
19:45 - know how to do that through coding
19:47 - that's a tough one like to tell it to
19:49 - only use the
19:54 - well well I guess if the program is
19:57 - offline then the only thing it has to go
19:59 - off off is the text I guess do not use
20:02 - any information you know about the
20:07 - world I mean I could scope it to that
20:10 - specific piece of text I'm giving it
20:12 - include the title of the podcast so I I
20:14 - don't I don't really know exactly what
20:16 - he's talking about here but let's keep
20:17 - going you can't right there's no pseudo
20:20 - code there's no proof there's no
20:21 - mathematical symbology here
20:23 - right um the other thing to notice is
20:27 - maybe I'm too dumb for that if you if
20:29 - you know let us know in the comments
20:31 - below at least for me I don't know about
20:33 - any of you do you understand this do you
20:34 - understand what it's saying does it make
20:37 - sense can you read it can you reason
20:40 - about what it's supposed to do yes of
20:41 - course right it's in plain
20:43 - English doesn't have to be English by
20:45 - the way it could be in Mandarin Chinese
20:47 - or espiranto
20:50 - have you all seen the xkcd about the guy
20:53 - who walks into his friend's house and he
20:55 - says okay Alexa order 5 tons of creamed
20:57 - corn okay Alexa confirm order it's how
21:00 - he makes sure that no one's got a
21:02 - speaker listening to him okay so the
21:04 - point being that this is now how I am
21:06 - actually writing code and what's funny
21:07 - about this is a lot of it is trial and
21:10 - error and experimentation by the way
21:12 - that's the same when I'm writing normal
21:13 - computer
21:15 - code and the other thing that's
21:17 - interesting about this is there's a lot
21:19 - so yeah trial and error is there I mean
21:21 - I do that too that's why I'm still
21:23 - spending 150 hours when I was building
21:25 - that app and I couldn't just do it with
21:26 - one prompt there was a ER then I would
21:29 - tell the computer again hey we got an
21:30 - error let's do this let's do this let's
21:32 - do this and I just kept working with it
21:34 - and making progress a lot of subtlety in
21:37 - terms of how you instruct the model and
21:38 - how you know what it's going to do with
21:40 - your instructions you can't write a
21:42 - manual that says well here's the set of
21:44 - words that you need to use to get the
21:45 - model to do X Y or Z you have to just
21:48 - try out certain things in this case I
21:50 - found out the do not in all caps really
21:53 - helped because I really wanted to
21:55 - emphasize that point to the model
21:58 - this reminds me of another programming
22:00 - language that someone came up with a
22:01 - while ago called intercal intercal was
22:04 - meant to be one of these uh kind of
22:06 - obscure or maybe satirical joke
22:08 - programming languages intercal had these
22:10 - interesting features like brain [ __ ] or
22:13 - Whit
22:14 - space such as you had to use the keyword
22:17 - please and if you use the keyword please
22:20 - too often the compiler would reject your
22:22 - program if you didn't use it enough it
22:24 - would also reject your program and it
22:26 - turned out that feature was undoc doed
22:29 - it's exactly like what we're doing today
22:31 - right we have to say please and do not
22:32 - in all caps to get the language models
22:34 - to do what we
22:35 - want so where am I going with all this I
22:37 - think what I'm saying here is we are now
22:40 - in an era where we have machines that
22:42 - can take natural language in and produce
22:46 - results algorithmic results
22:48 - computational results but for which no
22:51 - human has written a program in anything
22:54 - resembling a conventional programming
22:56 - language and I claim that these models
22:59 - are going to get so good at doing this
23:02 - that our whole concept of programming
23:03 - computers is going to get replaced over
23:05 - time with instructing language models to
23:08 - do things for us yes that I 100% agree
23:12 - with that that's I what I see happening
23:15 - right now I just I don't remember a lot
23:19 - of these apps I built over the last
23:21 - couple of months I just don't remember
23:24 - writing code from scratch I just really
23:26 - don't I just tell
23:28 - I'll give you an example it be like hey
23:30 - uh I need to make a button for a modal
23:33 - uh when a user clicks it it should pop
23:36 - this up and let them add a new to-do
23:38 - cool and then I
23:40 - just I just look around wait for the
23:43 - chat GPT code to come in grab it put it
23:45 - in there Boom come right back and then
23:48 - just you know see if it works great it
23:51 - worked I have nothing to do I can
23:53 - continue moving if it doesn't work come
23:55 - back didn't work this is the error I'm
23:57 - getting
23:58 - wait for it to give me the code copy
24:00 - paste Works Cool mostly I'm just
24:03 - thinking of what feature to add what's a
24:05 - new thing to add and I'm thinking of the
24:07 - next steps rather
24:09 - than
24:11 - like um do I need to use map for this or
24:15 - what JavaScript algorithm do I need to
24:17 - use to make this more efficient o am I
24:20 - writing it in two for Loops instead of
24:22 - one oh my god did I unsubscribe from my
24:26 - Firebase because I'm going to get a a
24:29 - read of 50,000 plus reads and that's
24:32 - going to blow through my quota and I'm
24:33 - going to get end up getting charged so
24:35 - much I just want to make sure that my
24:37 - unsubscribe is done properly let me just
24:40 - try to remember the documentation of
24:41 - Firebase real quick go to stack Overflow
24:45 - and and look it up by some some passive
24:47 - aggressive nerd that wrote the top
24:49 - comment let me let me copy paste from
24:51 - him like that's where a lot of my time
24:52 - was going whereas like now it's like it
24:55 - just does it for you and it handles it
24:57 - it for you and I love that just makes
25:01 - those things simpler I don't I shouldn't
25:03 - really need to use my brain for like
25:05 - looking up documentation looking up all
25:07 - these things that just are very tedious
25:10 - and it's like I I get the point of what
25:12 - I'm trying to
25:15 - do so let's take a look at the state of
25:19 - programming language technology this is
25:21 - a programmer uh without co-pilot in
25:24 - around 2020 colorized bro this is
25:27 - exactly what I've been saying that is
25:29 - you that is you no offense if you don't
25:33 - use Ai and Chad GPT to help you so
25:36 - whether that's co-pilot or Chad GPT or
25:38 - any other tools that exist there's so
25:39 - many other tools that exist GPT pilot
25:41 - exists I was going to do a video on that
25:43 - but that's you this is what I was trying
25:45 - to say you're on feet while I'm in a car
25:49 - you're walking on your feet while I'm in
25:51 - a [ __ ] yacht or on a plane traveling
25:54 - somewhere and then you're trying to race
25:56 - with me so that's why it's so funny like
26:00 - that there's so many amazing parallels
26:01 - he's drawing here okay I think I met
26:03 - that guy out in Central Square this
26:05 - morning um and here's a programmer with
26:08 - co-pilot in 2021 right so clearly we're
26:10 - evolving very rapidly as a species of
26:12 - programmers unfortunately both of these
26:13 - cases are male I apologize for
26:16 - that so how many people here have used
26:19 - co-pilot or one of its ilk in terms of
26:21 - he helping you write code don't be shy I
26:25 - know you're Prof you're like who's my
26:26 - professor in here
26:28 - oh [ __ ] all right so co-pilot if you
26:30 - haven't used it is a complete Game
26:33 - Changer in terms of how real world
26:35 - developers write code okay yes it's also
26:37 - kind of a huge boost for students who
26:39 - want to effectively shortcut their
26:41 - homework speedrun if I don't have
26:43 - co-pilot I absolutely feel naked I was
26:44 - on the airplane out here I was writing
26:46 - codes yeah I just love when I'm doing
26:47 - co-pilot I use jbt more than I use
26:49 - co-pilot but I also love that it can
26:52 - just start to finish up the thing that
26:53 - I'm about to write including
26:55 - documentation right I'll be writing a
26:57 - documentation it'll just autoc complete
26:58 - it or if I'm writing a function it'll
27:00 - just autocomplete it so I really like
27:03 - that the Wi-Fi was not quite fast enough
27:05 - so I would type out you know my half a
27:07 - line of code and just sort of wait for
27:08 - co-pilot to finish it for me like I
27:10 - always do but normally that happens in
27:11 - about like less than a second and this
27:13 - time it was just taking so long I said
27:14 - ah damn it I guess I have to write this
27:16 - myself just like I used to a year
27:20 - ago copilot is is incredible for a few
27:23 - reasons I think one of the things that
27:24 - people don't fully appreciate is that it
27:26 - keeps you in the zone of writing code it
27:29 - used to be the case that anytime I'd hit
27:31 - a little snag I'd be like oh crap I
27:33 - can't quite remember the Syntax for how
27:34 - I you know reverse a list in whatever
27:36 - language I'm working in yeah crap well I
27:38 - know where to find the answer I'll just
27:39 - Google it it's on stack Overflow
27:41 - somewhere and so I go and I Google it
27:44 - and I find the the thing it's probably
27:45 - not a direct answer so I have to kind of
27:46 - read the article a little bit and kind
27:48 - of piece together oh yeah that's the
27:49 - snippet I was looking for and then 45
27:51 - minutes later what am I doing I'm on
27:53 - Reddit somewhere you know I've gone down
27:54 - the Rat Hole of surfing the internet I
27:56 - got out of the zone of writing code
27:59 - yeah keep you in the zone I I think
28:01 - people are so much more productive with
28:03 - this to the point where we mandated
28:04 - every developer our company has to use
28:06 - co-pilot yes if there's somebody not
28:08 - using co-pilot they're going to be fired
28:09 - well I didn't say that but kind of the
28:11 - idea so a lot of people that should be
28:15 - the idea chastised or criticized
28:17 - co-pilot for being a little dumb right
28:19 - it's not it's like well it's just
28:20 - trained on stuff it found on the
28:22 - internet on GitHub and homework
28:23 - assignments how good can it be and now
28:25 - I'm going to get more nerds in the
28:26 - comment
28:28 - I don't want to give my data to anybody
28:29 - I don't want to give my data to anybody
28:31 - but like your data is how it's I don't
28:34 - even want to get into that combat but
28:35 - like I remember making a video recently
28:37 - and everybody went and lost their [ __ ]
28:39 - cuz I said I love to give away my data
28:42 - you're
28:43 - like that's how it gets better share
28:45 - your data that's how it get better it's
28:48 - incredibly good it's not just parting
28:51 - back things that it's seen elsewhere
28:53 - it's interpreting your program and your
28:55 - intent it's looking at other parts of
28:57 - your code to understand what you might
28:58 - do next it's um understanding your data
29:01 - structures it's not just looking at a
29:03 - little context window in this current
29:04 - file you're editing it's looking
29:05 - elsewhere in the code to find something
29:07 - that might be relevant and the only
29:09 - thing that is stopping co-pilot from
29:11 - getting really really really good at
29:13 - this is just more data and more compute
29:16 - and guess what we have both of those in
29:17 - abundance oh yeah right there's nothing
29:19 - that's going to stop this from getting
29:21 - incredibly good
29:23 - overtime um so here's another kind of
29:26 - similar use case this is not uh co-pilot
29:28 - this is chat GPT which I'm sure we're
29:29 - all familiar with M but if you are
29:32 - trying to figure out how to do something
29:34 - and in this case I was you know using
29:36 - the Deep gram python SD again Shameless
29:39 - plug if you want to learn these exact
29:42 - skills how to build apps fast and use
29:46 - that to make
29:48 - money I will show you I've put together
29:51 - a free training for you I literally show
29:53 - you how to build apps so damn quickly
29:55 - it'll make your head spin and I've had
29:57 - count count students go through it and
29:58 - have that experience so click the link
30:00 - below you have nothing to lose watch
30:03 - that free training because you can gain
30:04 - so much and it can change your life
30:06 - profoundly all right click below I want
30:09 - to see you in that training let's keep
30:10 - rolling okay to transcribe audio files
30:13 - for this podcast thing I mentioned
30:15 - earlier I could have spent 15 20 minutes
30:19 - reading their
30:21 - documentation finding some example code
30:23 - on the internet following a
30:26 - tutorial or dude that's so funny because
30:29 - I was literally working with deep gram
30:31 - deep gram is actually one of the best
30:32 - transcription sources of available deep
30:36 - gram is sick is if any of you is trying
30:38 - to do something with transcriptions look
30:40 - up deep gram it's awesome their API is
30:42 - so good because we're all like you know
30:44 - programmers are incredibly lazy just say
30:46 - hey look I'm trying to do this thing can
30:47 - you just give me the code I need and it
30:49 - does
30:51 - it co-pilot is not just understanding
30:53 - homework assignments chat gbt is not
30:54 - just understanding homework assignment
30:55 - it like understands other people's apis
30:58 - and sdks and programming libraries and
31:00 - abstractions and best practices and bugs
31:03 - that might occur I mean it's really got
31:04 - a lot of knowledge and so with very
31:06 - little and his his
31:08 - uh his uh GPT here is old right you
31:11 - could see cut off is 2021 now that GPT
31:14 - has been updated cut off is actually
31:17 - 2023 so GPT will know like pretty much
31:21 - everything every programming language
31:24 - and documentation that you're looking up
31:26 - right now effort then I can just cut and
31:28 - paste this code right into my program
31:29 - and get on with my
31:31 - life
31:34 - right shell Silverstein who wrote uh a
31:37 - Light in the Attic this is something a
31:38 - children's book book of children's
31:40 - poetry that I read when I was a kid I
31:41 - saw this on Reddit a couple days ago he
31:43 - completely predicted this right this is
31:45 - 1981 you know the homework machine oh
31:48 - The Homework Machine most perfect
31:49 - Contraption that's ever been seen just
31:50 - put in your homework then drop in a dime
31:52 - snap on the switch and in 10 seconds
31:54 - time your homework comes out quick and
31:56 - clean as can be here it is 9 plus 4 and
31:58 - the answer is three three oh me I guess
32:01 - it's not as perfect as I thought it
32:03 - would be exactly toss a dime takes about
32:07 - 10 seconds it gets the answer wrong this
32:09 - is very much what we're dealing with
32:11 - today I mean with GPT 3.5 yeah GPT 4
32:15 - it's a little bit better but I think
32:18 - with five and GPT
32:22 - 6 I think it'll start to give you pretty
32:24 - accurate answers right away by the way
32:26 - and this is a complete aside but I can't
32:28 - resist when I mentioned shelf
32:29 - Silverstein if you don't know what he
32:30 - looked like this was the cover uh the
32:33 - the photo on his the dust jacket of one
32:34 - of his first books this guy I love this
32:37 - guy a children's poetry book author from
32:40 - the 70s and that's what he looked like
32:42 - amazing all right
32:44 - so so now I want to talk about well if
32:47 - this AI technology is getting so
32:50 - good then what's going to happen to our
32:52 - industry what does this mean for all of
32:54 - us who might be looking to get jobs in
32:56 - this industry in the future future and
32:57 - expecting to get those you know big fat
32:59 - paychecks and stock option grants and
33:01 - you know buy Teslas or whatever we're
33:04 - expecting to do
33:05 - so how much does it cost to replace one
33:08 - human developer with AI well I did the
33:09 - math so let's say that a typical
33:11 - software engineer salary in Sil Valley
33:13 - oh that's really good this is the juicy
33:16 - part I'm excited let's see it Seattle is
33:19 - around 220,000 a year that's just the
33:20 - base salary doesn't include benefits
33:22 - doesn't include Equity packages doesn't
33:25 - include your free lunch and your bowling
33:26 - alley and all that kind of
33:28 - stuff so let's just assume that that
33:31 - stuff cost you know 92k a year which is
33:34 - again a little conservative so the total
33:35 - cost to your employer is roughly 300
33:38 - 312k for One
33:42 - S many working days are there in a year
33:44 - about 260 and so it costs $1,200 a day
33:47 - to employ you as a s at one of these
33:49 - companies fair enough $1,200 a day think
33:53 - about how much HP cost per day right as
33:56 - many queries as you want maybe
33:59 - $5 maybe $3
34:04 - $5 think about that $1,200 divided by
34:07 - $5 240 times cheaper so that means for
34:12 - you they could hire 240
34:16 - developers so I mean like you know what
34:18 - I mean like I hope it's adding up but I
34:21 - hope you're not getting scared I want to
34:23 - empower you that's the idea it's not so
34:25 - you're freaked out and like I should
34:27 - just quit and just do something else to
34:29 - just become a truck driver that's not
34:31 - the idea I'm trying to show you that
34:34 - there is a way let's keep
34:36 - going okay so let's do the math how many
34:39 - lines of code do you think an average
34:41 - developer checks in to the code base
34:43 - every day I mean finalized tested
34:46 - reviewed and approved lines of
34:48 - code most of us who worked in Industry
34:50 - know that the uh the median value is
34:53 - zero because there's so many days that
34:55 - you go by where you're waiting on
34:56 - somebody else or you're in meetings all
34:57 - day you didn't get anything done you
34:58 - didn't check it in but let's just be
35:00 - generous here and say it's about 100 I
35:02 - know 100 doesn't sound like a lot people
35:03 - like but I was programming all day yes
35:05 - but 90% of your code you ended up
35:06 - throwing out or somebody reviewed it and
35:08 - said it was no good you have to rewrite
35:09 - it you were trying to figure out what to
35:10 - do you were revamping it so like the
35:12 - final result of your output is something
35:14 - like a 100 lines of code a day that's
35:16 - the final
35:17 - result how many gpt3 model tokens is
35:20 - that it's about 10 uh tokens per line
35:23 - more or less so and the cost for GPT ooh
35:27 - this is strong logic right let me
35:29 - actually go back out so like the final
35:33 - how many gpt3 and the cost for dpt3
35:36 - current actually this is probably a
35:37 - little out of date but at the time I
35:38 - made this slide it was 2 cents for a th
35:40 - tokens okay so if you do the math then
35:43 - the total cost for the output of one
35:45 - human software developer on gpt3 is 12
35:52 - cents this is a factor of 10,000
35:59 - 12
36:01 - cents I mean like
36:05 - look I know it's hard for maybe you or
36:08 - somebody who's a developer to think like
36:10 - this right but I'm a CEO I run a company
36:12 - so I think like this if I was a
36:16 - developer and my entire life depended on
36:18 - it and it was tied to my identity And if
36:20 - every dollar I made was from development
36:23 - I'd be scared shitless and I would be
36:25 - commenting on people's real
36:27 - telling them that they
36:29 - are scum for talking about the future of
36:33 - future becoming Ai and going away from
36:35 - coding I would be doing the same thing
36:36 - probably I I wouldn't I know myself but
36:39 - let's just say okay in some world I I
36:41 - might be doing something similar or at
36:44 - least I could understand how you would
36:46 - do that and and feel empowered by it in
36:49 - a sense of control cuz you're scared
36:51 - your future is about to get uh erupted
36:54 - right or
36:55 - disrupted but but as a CEO bro like give
36:59 - me this all [ __ ] day I don't have to
37:02 - deal with their headaches I don't have
37:04 - to deal with their emotional problems a
37:07 - lot of a lot of developers have health
37:09 - problems that I have to deal with and
37:10 - then they it [ __ ] up their mental stuff
37:13 - uh they need days off they're like so um
37:19 - a lot of developers they're just
37:20 - terrible at
37:22 - communication I have you you know
37:23 - somebody has to manage them and make
37:25 - sure that they're hit the deadlines and
37:28 - there's just so much crap and I've I've
37:30 - hired so many software developers on my
37:32 - own company and we're a small company at
37:34 - clever program or a tiny company imagine
37:36 - companies where there's hundreds or
37:38 - thousands of developers tens of
37:40 - thousands right for some companies that
37:42 - are big
37:43 - enough but there's just so much other
37:45 - stuff that you have to deal with and so
37:46 - for me it's like [ __ ] no I'm not doing
37:49 - this I'm not hiring the developers and
37:53 - that's exactly what I did when I was
37:54 - building my entire software where I just
37:57 - built it all by
37:59 - myself and most of the apps that we
38:01 - build are built with AI and it costs
38:04 - fraction of the price and it's amazing
38:07 - now I will pay somebody $800 or less and
38:11 - we'll build out a full app together
38:14 - whereas before I would have paid them 10
38:15 - grand over two months 3 months and it
38:18 - would have taken so much time you know
38:19 - so not to mention like time not to
38:22 - mention time because people are slow and
38:25 - it takes them time you know all so much
38:28 - stuff this thing here never
38:32 - sleeps
38:35 - uh writes better
38:39 - code uh no days
38:42 - off right
38:46 - um
38:48 - like no no problems has no problems
38:52 - right essentially there's no
38:55 - problems
38:58 - um you know you know what I mean so it's
38:59 - just like not only just the cost Factor
39:03 - but the time Factor right does it
39:07 - instantly okay uh Works
39:11 - 24/7 so like if you just think about
39:15 - that it's it should I hope start to make
39:18 - sense where we're headed and what that
39:21 - means is you got to get occupied and you
39:23 - got you got to get equipped with the
39:25 - skills need needed to be in that
39:27 - direction meaning you need to be prompt
39:29 - engineering like a god you need to start
39:32 - developing more product manager skills
39:34 - Vision skills of how what features to
39:36 - build why to build them how they can
39:39 - make money for the company that you're
39:40 - working at no more being protected by
39:42 - Daddy because you're a sweetheart and a
39:46 - company that has a lot of money is going
39:47 - to protect you and provide you with
39:48 - safety right you want to be somebody
39:51 - who's actually valuable and making sure
39:52 - you're doing things that make that
39:54 - company money and so if you constant
39:56 - conly keep thinking like that you're
39:57 - going to be a valuable asset to society
39:59 - forever and you're going to learn these
40:01 - skills like prompt engineering along the
40:03 - way and so then your coding skills will
40:05 - feed into more of the prompt engineering
40:08 - where your coding skills will come into
40:10 - play is when you go get into
40:13 - bugs using your coding skills you'll be
40:15 - able to debug using your coding
40:17 - knowledge of the sphere of which
40:19 - Frameworks to use what technologies to
40:21 - use which apis to potentially use that
40:24 - kind of creative creative thinking is
40:25 - still valid valuble now might some of
40:28 - that might go away in 5 10 years
40:31 - because AI will start to have creative
40:34 - thinking too but that is the valuable
40:37 - asset right now so think more about that
40:41 - factor of
40:45 - 10,000 this should scare us all wow
40:49 - right this suggests potentially a very
40:52 - large shift in our
40:53 - industry I don't think we can ignore
40:55 - this and just write it off and say well
40:56 - the AI is not very good today so
40:57 - therefore it's not going to be good in 5
41:00 - years right this radically changes how
41:03 - we think about only reason that
41:04 - programmers are paid so much is that it
41:06 - requires years and years and years of
41:08 - Education and Training and knowledge and
41:09 - specialization to be good at it but
41:12 - there's no reason that I need to hire a
41:15 - super smart you know Harvard educated
41:17 - student to do this if I can get chat PT
41:19 - to do most of the work for me and have a
41:20 - human typing it in
41:23 - yes MH there's a lot of other advantages
41:26 - to hiring the robots instead of the
41:28 - humans hey this is already I already
41:30 - covered all that let's go we already
41:33 - covered all that maybe but let's see
41:36 - what he says right robot's not going to
41:38 - take breaks the robot is not today
41:41 - expecting free lunches and you know
41:42 - on-site massage that could change the
41:45 - robot takes the same length of time to
41:47 - generate its code whether it's the rough
41:49 - proof of concept or the final production
41:51 - ready code when you go as a PM to an
41:54 - organization to your engineering team
41:56 - and you you say Okay team there's eight
41:58 - of you here we have to ship the billing
42:01 - page how soon can we do it you're going
42:04 - to spend at least an hour and a half
42:05 - having the conversation well you know
42:06 - like if we do it quick and dirty we can
42:08 - maybe do it in three weeks and if it's
42:09 - got to be production ready give us
42:13 - 12 that's another thing I didn't think
42:15 - about that meetings and the back and
42:17 - forth and all that you can have that
42:19 - with Chad GPT and it's almost instant
42:21 - you don't have to have that either you
42:23 - can save all that time that you normally
42:26 - would be wasting on
42:28 - meetings or you can go to the proverbial
42:30 - Homework Machine push the button and
42:32 - have the code right
42:33 - now
42:35 - right um and the other thing is yes the
42:37 - robot makes mistakes but those mistakes
42:40 - can happen incredibly quickly to the to
42:42 - the level of speed where iterate iterate
42:44 - iterate iterate iterate iterate iterate
42:46 - is perfectly fine you can say to the
42:47 - robot you know what this whole thing
42:50 - 5,000 source files 20,000 lines of code
42:53 - whatever it is blow it away start over
42:55 - boom five seconds later you have a brand
42:57 - new version of it yep try that with a
43:00 - live Human engineer
43:01 - team right so I think this is all like
43:06 - something that we really have to take
43:07 - seriously I don't think that this is
43:09 - just I am exaggerating for effect but
43:12 - the industry is going to
43:16 - change so you know the natural question
43:19 - then is well what what happens when we
43:20 - cut humans out of the loop how do we
43:23 - build software how do we ship product um
43:25 - I found this video on I think it's
43:27 - Microsoft's website and it's titled what
43:29 - do product managers do uh that was a
43:31 - little bit of an unintended joke I think
43:33 - because as an engineer we often go what
43:35 - do product managers do um but if you
43:38 - imagine what the software team of the
43:40 - future might look
43:41 - like well you saw that repet tweet that
43:46 - I showed you on
43:48 - Twitter that PM was killing it at the
43:51 - hackathon and then based on what he's
43:52 - saying yeah like look at that right you
43:55 - got a PM doing everything the this is
43:59 - he's actually kind of talking about that
44:01 - right now right AI robot makes a code
44:04 - which generates a code and then you got
44:05 - the human code reviewer so honestly what
44:09 - will be happening is developers will
44:12 - turn into code reviewers this is why in
44:15 - my course and in my program I'm training
44:17 - people to think like product managers
44:21 - and then use AI to build stuff and be
44:24 - the one to be able to review the code
44:27 - those are the people that are not going
44:28 - to get
44:29 - replaced this is what's happening right
44:33 - your your job as a developer is going to
44:36 - get commoditized and it's going to be
44:38 - down to you being a human code
44:42 - reviewer you understand that you're
44:44 - going to be a [ __ ] spell
44:46 - checker in a few years so if you want to
44:50 - be complacent and sit down on it and
44:52 - just be like this is it I I've made it
44:54 - I'm good I'm a software developer now
44:56 - you're going to be demoted to a spell
44:57 - checker my friend this is the equivalent
45:00 - of a spell checker so just be aware of
45:02 - that approach which is you have a
45:04 - product manager this is probably still a
45:06 - human taking the business and the
45:09 - product requirements the user
45:10 - requirements and translating them into
45:11 - some form probably English maybe a
45:14 - little bit technical English that you
45:16 - then can provide to the AI the army of
45:18 - AI code
45:20 - generators the AI code generators give
45:23 - you a whole bunch of code and probably
45:25 - for a while still we still have humans
45:27 - reading and reviewing the code to make
45:29 - sure that it does what it was supposed
45:30 - to do now that read is a little
45:33 - different than what we have today today
45:34 - when we review code if I have another
45:35 - engineer on my team writing code and I'm
45:37 - reviewing it standard practice in the
45:38 - industry is to do code review for one
45:39 - another we don't just check in code we
45:41 - read each other's code we make detailed
45:42 - comments on it we suggest improvements
45:44 - cleanups clarifications comments
45:47 - documentation in this case it's not
45:50 - absolutely essential that this code be
45:52 - maintainable by a human I think for a
45:54 - while we're going to want that right
45:56 - most people are not going to feel
45:57 - comfortable just letting the robots do
45:59 - all the coding but at some point as long
46:02 - as I can convince myself that the code
46:04 - does what it's supposed to do I mean
46:06 - it's kind of like AI
46:09 - cars cars that drive on autopilot
46:11 - without needing a driver in order for
46:14 - Humanity to get to get used to it I mean
46:16 - it'll take some time it'll be scary
46:19 - you'll sit in an Uber ride and you
46:21 - wouldn't feel
46:23 - comfortable driving to downtown with no
46:26 - driver there and the car driving itself
46:29 - it will freak most people
46:32 - out marz brownley or am I saying his
46:37 - name right or am I just making it up
46:39 - MKBHD okay maybe I'm saying his name
46:41 - wrong but
46:43 - MKBHD he made a video where he was
46:46 - driving a Tesla and it was riding it
46:48 - automatically and his heart rate was
46:49 - like elevated up to 140 beats per
46:53 - minute that is something that
46:56 - clearly shows you he's
46:59 - scared and that's the fear that we're
47:01 - going to have for a while right but just
47:03 - like a child learns to walk and learns
47:06 - to ride a bike the first time you rode a
47:07 - bike your heart was beating and you were
47:09 - scared the first time you were crossing
47:12 - the street you were probably
47:15 - scared just like that you know the first
47:17 - time you go to an interview doesn't mean
47:18 - all those things are bad for you the
47:20 - first time you public speak you're
47:22 - scared the first time you're you raise
47:24 - your hand and answer question or the
47:26 - Teacher Calls on you and you answer it
47:28 - you're scared just like
47:30 - that we're going to be scared initially
47:33 - to give up control for the code to the
47:35 - AI but if you saw your friend ride in a
47:42 - autopilot car now you'll be a little bit
47:44 - less scared now if you saw 10 of your
47:46 - friends do that you'll be a little less
47:48 - scared now if you found out that your
47:49 - entire family and all your friends have
47:51 - been riding in autopilot cars for years
47:53 - you'll be less scared if you found
47:57 - out you know there's millions of people
47:59 - now doing it you'll be less
48:02 - scared if you saw reviews you'll start
48:05 - to be less scared if you watch other
48:07 - people doing it on YouTube you'll be
48:08 - less scared and so the more accepted it
48:11 - gets the more of a social Norm becomes
48:14 - the less scary it becomes so in this
48:16 - case with this situation here the
48:19 - programming being changed and taken over
48:21 - by AI will start to give up more and
48:24 - more control and be less and less
48:26 - scared as it can show us it can do a
48:29 - good job and get us from point A to
48:31 - point B without us getting into a car
48:33 - crash and
48:34 - dying I don't really care how messy it
48:36 - is I don't really care how it's
48:38 - structured I don't really care how
48:39 - reusable it is all of those factors are
48:41 - only because poor humans have to Wrangle
48:43 - with this
48:44 - stuff right oh it needs to be modular we
48:48 - need to have abstraction boundaries
48:50 - right all the things you know sophomore
48:51 - level computer science right why for the
48:54 - sake of poor humans having to deal with
48:55 - this complex code base but if the robots
48:58 - are the ones generating it and we don't
48:59 - really need to maintain it in a
49:00 - conventional way why not just generate
49:03 - the code you need it doesn't really
49:04 - matter if it's duplicative or repetitive
49:06 - or modular or nicely abstracted doesn't
49:09 - matter does the
49:12 - job yeah I agree so one of my hypotheses
49:16 - around why everyone has been freaking
49:17 - out about chat gbt is because unlike
49:20 - other
49:21 - Industries um this revolution seemed to
49:24 - occur overnight unless you that's what
49:26 - I'm talking about this is why I'm
49:27 - getting the [ __ ] hate it's crazy
49:31 - Psychopaths insane insane I've never
49:34 - experienced that before but they're
49:35 - going crazy it's like hoorde mob but
49:37 - come at me I don't give a [ __ ] you know
49:40 - if you if you want to do that I'm happy
49:41 - to have a open discourse and open
49:43 - dialogue that's the beautiful thing
49:46 - about the world and our country we we're
49:49 - allowed to have freedom of speech so I
49:51 - welcome
49:53 - that but yeah it's sudden and happened
49:56 - overnight I want to let him uh speak on
49:58 - this more you're like a AI professor and
50:01 - have really been following the
50:02 - literature for years and years and years
50:04 - to most of us myself included this
50:06 - seemed to just go from you know AI was
50:09 - kind of crappy to AI was amazing
50:11 - literally overnight right so to use an
50:13 - analogy this would be as if the field of
50:15 - computer Graphics went from pong to Red
50:19 - Dead Redemption 2 in the span of about
50:21 - three months yes that is a
50:26 - brilliant
50:28 - analogy right people's heads would
50:30 - explode if that happened right but
50:32 - that's not what happened in graphics
50:33 - right in graphics it took decades to get
50:35 - to this point and everyone could see it
50:37 - gradually getting better and better and
50:38 - better you know I remember when Toy
50:40 - Story came out and that was like the
50:42 - first CG movie people's minds just
50:45 - melted watching that they were like whoa
50:48 - and now we watch it and you just like oh
50:49 - yeah that's cute you know I could render
50:51 - that on my laptop and scratch or
50:53 - whatever
50:54 - right
50:56 - the other thing that's happened I think
50:57 - in this field that's interesting and
50:59 - there's a big societal shift happening
51:01 - is the dialogue around our expectations
51:04 - of what AI can achieve and so in 1972
51:08 - Hubert draus wrote this book what
51:09 - computers can't do and this was at the
51:11 - dawn of the PC era and there was a lot
51:14 - of popular press and dialogue around
51:17 - this sort of scaremongering around Ai
51:18 - and you know we had movies come out like
51:20 - war games does anybody remember that I
51:21 - think War Games by the way that movie is
51:23 - why I a computer scientist right I was
51:25 - like I want to be Matthew broadrick I
51:27 - got to watch that movie in this room
51:29 - with like all these monitors and my like
51:31 - analog modem and hacking into the school
51:33 - computer like that was me as a kid so at
51:36 - this time I think a lot of people were
51:38 - saying well hold on a minute computers
51:41 - are fundamentally dumb and they can't do
51:42 - these things and they never will and
51:45 - that was the thesis of this book here
51:46 - and I think that that was the sort of
51:47 - consensus view right we we sort of calm
51:49 - down a little bit about the technology
51:51 - we all kind of realize yeah okay visaal
51:53 - is not going to put me out of out of out
51:54 - of a job
51:56 - right but now Fast Forward 2014 I highly
51:59 - recommend this book if you haven't read
52:00 - it by Nick Bostrom called super
52:01 - intelligence this is a book that
52:03 - wrestles in a tremendous amount of
52:05 - detail with the philosophical it's
52:07 - called super intelligence by the I mean
52:09 - yeah okay you could see it my bad the
52:10 - moral questions of how does human
52:13 - society respond to an AI that is more
52:15 - intelligent than
52:17 - humans and I know we've got you know a
52:19 - lot of sci-fi around that topic but this
52:21 - is a very serious academic work about
52:24 - what does it mean for our society
52:25 - if we have ai that is smarter than
52:30 - us and people are taking that very
52:32 - seriously today so I think my point
52:34 - being that the the dialogue that we've
52:36 - been having in the uh in society at
52:38 - large has shifted away like this stuff
52:40 - I'm a little less you know I'm not like
52:43 - a theoretician I'm a practical Builder
52:46 - and so I am excited about what I can
52:48 - build today with AI and that's what I
52:51 - want to share with you guys right that
52:53 - using these tools you can be building
52:55 - apps today regardless of if you have
52:58 - coding skills or not and you can learn
53:01 - specifically the skills you need on the
53:03 - fly with
53:04 - AI helping you but like today there's no
53:08 - reason that you can't be freaking iron
53:10 - man everybody's an Iron Man today with
53:14 - their
53:15 - Jarvis that's how it feels to me at
53:17 - least when I go into Chad GPT and I
53:19 - start building apps with it so I want to
53:21 - just open your minds to that and I want
53:23 - you to be practical right be a practical
53:26 - Builder I mean all this Theory stuff is
53:28 - cool like what if we have robots
53:30 - everywhere and we feel like slaves and
53:33 - what if the robots kill us sure we're
53:35 - going to die anyways right at some point
53:38 - so I'm much more interested in what we
53:40 - could practically do with the tools that
53:41 - we have today and in the next couple of
53:43 - years what that looks like from AI as a
53:46 - toy to AI might actually destroy
53:52 - Society so let's just talk rap rapidly
53:55 - about the future the evolution of
53:56 - programming as I see it so you know in
53:58 - the dawn of time we had humans directly
54:01 - writing machine instructions and you
54:02 - know inputting him with toggle switches
54:04 - and stuff like that right that was this
54:05 - is exactly what I was talking about
54:07 - earlier in the video that was before
54:10 - programming and theams in higher level
54:11 - languages yep and then he goes then we
54:13 - went higher level languages that's why
54:15 - I'm skipping through a little bit cuz we
54:16 - already kind of talked about this point
54:18 - that he's making right now that's beond
54:19 - St who invented C++ so we went from like
54:21 - toggling switches to now C++ Plus
54:27 - and in modern times we have a world in
54:29 - which humans are writing their code but
54:30 - they're heavily assisted by Ai and they
54:33 - can get away with things like well I'll
54:34 - just write a comment and have the AI
54:36 - write the code for me
54:38 - right
54:40 - yes but my claim is that the future of
54:43 - this really is skipping the programming
54:45 - step
54:46 - entirely think a yeah exactly think of
54:49 - it I love that photo actually because it
54:51 - just sparked an idea in my head but AI
54:54 - is a new child child it's basically just
54:57 - like how you train so for example right
54:59 - I could become a programmer or I could
55:00 - have a child Inspire the child to become
55:03 - a programmer and then he or she becomes
55:05 - a programmer in the next 18 21 years um
55:09 - and then goes on and becomes an epic
55:12 - programmer right but then there's all
55:13 - this time and cost
55:15 - and so much random [ __ ] right where with
55:19 - AI there there isn't that like you teach
55:22 - the AI model how to think or how to
55:24 - solve a and like you could Inspire an AI
55:27 - probably in the future to become a
55:29 - computer scientist and then it goes on
55:31 - to become a computer scientist and then
55:32 - it goes on to become the best computer
55:34 - scientist in the world and it goes on to
55:35 - build the best apps
55:38 - and all of that happens within maybe a
55:41 - couple of minutes maybe within a week
55:44 - you know just like the AI that sat down
55:46 - that taught itself chess and then 24
55:48 - hours later it beat Magnus Carlson who's
55:50 - the number one chess player in the
55:52 - world a lot of people who've read my
55:54 - article on this topic is in the C
55:56 - misinterpreted it as saying AI is going
55:58 - to write code for us therefore
55:59 - programmers should not exist I'm not
56:01 - saying
56:02 - that that's very important so I'm going
56:05 - to repeat that AI is going to write code
56:07 - for us therefore programmer should not
56:11 - exist okay so this is my point that I've
56:14 - been
56:15 - saying even if traditional speaking
56:18 - programming is going to die right I have
56:20 - to write a headline to get people's
56:22 - attention that's what everybody does but
56:25 - it's not that it's not true it's that
56:26 - programmers role will shift heavily and
56:31 - I want to catch your attention by
56:32 - Shocking you and then I want to show you
56:34 - what's the way that you can
56:36 - go so this is exactly what he's saying
56:39 - where're programmers is isn't that
56:41 - programmer shouldn't exist but
56:43 - programmers are going to evolve to
56:44 - prompt engineering and building apps
56:47 - they're going to get promoted into a
56:49 - product manager role where they're going
56:51 - to be product managers and maybe even
56:53 - human reviewers you know code reviewers
56:55 - or they're going to have human code
56:56 - reviewers underneath them but that's I
57:00 - believe where the shift will be going
57:03 - I'm not saying that I'm actually saying
57:04 - something much worse which is you won't
57:07 - have to have programs at all you just
57:09 - tell the language model what you want
57:11 - and it directly computes the
57:13 - results he went even one step further
57:16 - than
57:17 - me there's no program
57:20 - step and I I think that opens up it is
57:24 - an interesting challenge for our field
57:25 - but I think it opens up a tremendous
57:27 - opportunity because now the question is
57:29 - how do I effectively teach these models
57:32 - what to do coming back to my example
57:34 - earlier of having to use the words do
57:35 - not in all
57:37 - caps what are the best practices and
57:40 - Beyond best practices can we turn this
57:41 - from effectively a dark art into a
57:46 - science into that is actually one of the
57:49 - things that I discovered when I was
57:50 - doing so these are the skills you're
57:51 - going to need to develop and I agree
57:52 - with him where he's going with this but
57:54 - when I was building my own
57:56 - app um a lot of the time that I I I
58:00 - spent was discovering the dark arts of
58:03 - how
58:04 - to coax and chus and guide Chad GPT into
58:11 - the app that I was trying to get it to
58:13 - build and it was me just learning all
58:17 - these tricky prompt engineering
58:22 - hacks the one for example he shared with
58:25 - you where he writes do not ENC caps and
58:27 - that enforces a certain Behavior then
58:30 - you know for example I was teaching it
58:32 - with I was giving it certain examples of
58:34 - things it should be able to do or things
58:37 - it shouldn't be able to do but then what
58:38 - happened was when I was giving it those
58:41 - examples it started adding specific text
58:45 - from those examples and everything that
58:47 - it did so started having a bias because
58:49 - of the example and I was like damn
58:51 - that's also what I didn't want so then I
58:53 - had to like keep tweaking it until I got
58:56 - the answer that I wanted and
58:58 - so there's there's a back and forth
59:00 - dance and that's where I'm saying you
59:03 - need to be spending time in because
59:04 - that's where I was spending time in and
59:06 - it's like it's creativity and science
59:09 - combined on how you can get it to do the
59:11 - thing that you want it to do that's
59:13 - where we're I believe where we're headed
59:15 - and where you're going to get the most
59:17 - value do an engineering discipline and
59:19 - people have talked about prompt
59:20 - engineering as a thing I I think that's
59:22 - meant kind of tongue and- cheek it's not
59:24 - really prompt engineering is not really
59:25 - a thing yet but it may well be in the
59:27 - future if we do this right so
59:32 - um one of the things that people often
59:34 - say about these models is that there's
59:35 - no way they can do anything interesting
59:37 - or creative because all they're doing is
59:39 - autoc completing based on large corpor
59:40 - of text that they've seen and been
59:41 - trained on that's [ __ ] I've done
59:45 - like it's true in terms of they've been
59:47 - trained on historical data but I've had
59:50 - it solve a lot of unique problems that
59:53 - have never been solved anywhere before
59:55 - and it was able to put those things
59:57 - things together and so I know firsthand
60:01 - that that's not the
60:02 - case I beg to differ now we obviously
60:05 - don't really know what's going on inside
60:07 - these models but if you ask a large
60:10 - language model to take a complex problem
60:14 - and effectively run a
60:16 - computation that is to manipulate a
60:19 - model of the world in its mind in this
60:22 - case I've come up with a simple problem
60:23 - here I've said I've got three stacks of
60:25 - cards red green and blue cards and
60:27 - they're all shuffled up in the following
60:28 - way please tell me how to lay them out
60:30 - into three stacks one red one green one
60:32 - blue simple problem right a child could
60:34 - do this now the key phrase here was as
60:38 - was discovered not long ago a couple you
60:39 - know few months ago you have to say the
60:41 - words the magic words let's think step
60:44 - by step if you say that to the model
60:47 - that somehow triggers it to go into
60:48 - computation mode now it's no longer just
60:51 - parting back some answer it's actually
60:53 - going to say okay well I have to
60:54 - actually elucidate each of my
60:57 - instructions and so it does it
60:59 - absolutely does it
61:01 - mhm and the fact that it's able to
61:03 - manipulate some kind of internal model
61:05 - of this stack of cards that I described
61:07 - and and and tell me exactly how it's
61:09 - going to work and and it's correct you
61:11 - know is fascinating to me it's not hard
61:13 - to trip it up there's plenty of places
61:15 - you can give it a problem and it's going
61:16 - to immediately fall over and go sorry
61:18 - it's going to give back bogus results so
61:20 - the question is why you know what do we
61:22 - do in this case how do we understand
61:24 - what the limits of this these models
61:29 - are so I do think that over time we're
61:31 - going to get to a place where
61:32 - programming ends up getting replaced by
61:34 - teaching new model uh teaching these
61:35 - models new skills
61:37 - yes so programming would get replaced by
61:41 - teaching these new
61:44 - models new
61:46 - skills and teaching them how to
61:48 - interface to apis and pulling data from
61:50 - databases and transforming data and how
61:52 - to interact with software meant for
61:53 - humans that's going to become an entire
61:56 - discipline right
61:58 - there um and one way of thinking about
62:00 - where this might go is what I like to
62:02 - call the natural language computer like
62:04 - for
62:05 - example I wanted to use v9 of Firebase
62:09 - which is the newest version of
62:12 - Firebase I couldn't do it because Chad
62:16 - GPT had a cut off or something and so
62:18 - Chad GPT didn't know about the newest
62:20 - version of Firebase it knew about the
62:22 - old version of Firebase I believe V8
62:26 - and I got it to write my code but it
62:28 - wrote it all in V8 the older version and
62:31 - so it kind of threw my entire app off
62:33 - because my app was requiring that I put
62:35 - it into
62:37 - v9 and I tried to look online and there
62:40 - weren't a lot
62:41 - of there wasn't a lot of gr there there
62:44 - was some documentation but I needed Chad
62:46 - GPT how to convert from V8 to v9 I
62:50 - needed to teach it how to convert that
62:52 - and there was a guide by fireship that
62:54 - shows you exactly an example in V8 and
62:57 - then right underneath it an example in
62:59 - v9 for things like adding things to the
63:02 - database deleting things editing things
63:05 - um adding one thing adding multiple
63:07 - things Etc and I took that
63:10 - guide and I gave it to Chad GPT and I'm
63:13 - like these are the instructions on how
63:14 - to go from V8 to
63:17 - v9
63:19 - and I just then let it run and after it
63:23 - ran it learned v9 how v9 works and
63:28 - that's exactly how you would teach a
63:29 - human that's exactly how I teach myself
63:31 - and ever since then my Chad gbt had
63:33 - learned how v9 works so then anytime I
63:36 - asked it to write code it would just
63:38 - give me in the v9 form that I asked for
63:41 - so it's something new that it learned
63:43 - and that was I thought a very cool
63:45 - application of this exact thing and
63:47 - that's the skill that you will need to
63:48 - start focusing on developing you know
63:50 - skills like
63:52 - that so the the vanoyan architecture
63:55 - has served us well for many decades this
63:59 - is the new
64:00 - architecture and the new architecture
64:02 - you give it a program in natural
64:04 - language you use a language model that
64:07 - then can call out to external systems
64:10 - and software as
64:12 - peripherals it can store results and
64:15 - tasks in its memory assisted by things
64:18 - like vector databases and so forth M and
64:20 - it can run autonomously in a cycle
64:23 - executing this program
64:25 - creating tasks accessing outside data
64:27 - sources generating new knowledge and so
64:30 - forth and tons of people are out there
64:32 - and we are too building things that
64:34 - effectively work this way and I think
64:36 - this is kind of a new computational
64:38 - architecture that we see emerging right
64:39 - now and I don't think anybody we don't
64:42 - have it right nobody has it right but
64:43 - this is we're seeing the inklings of it
64:45 - right what we have today is kind of the
64:47 - you know like the equivalent of I don't
64:49 - know the pdp1 or the apple one of this
64:52 - architecture coming together
64:56 - so um I'm legally mandated to pitch my
64:58 - startup okay so before he goes into his
65:02 - pitch Yeah so basically when I look at
65:05 - this let's go to the actual photo of
65:08 - this so yeah basically large language
65:12 - model will need a way to interface with
65:14 - the outside world and this is where
65:16 - external tools pereral come in so let's
65:19 - say you ask Chad GPT to make an app that
65:23 - can tell
65:25 - user the weather okay what the current
65:28 - weather is in their City chpt doesn't
65:31 - have that data off hand right it won't
65:33 - know the weather today or the weather
65:36 - tomorrow Etc and so Chad GPT the natural
65:40 - language program will go out to an
65:43 - API and then ping that API and that API
65:46 - will get the weather data Etc it'll do
65:49 - all the tasks it need to do to get that
65:51 - and then it'll store it in memory and JP
65:54 - will use something like a vector
65:55 - database you don't have to worry about
65:57 - it basically it gives it like long-term
65:58 - memory so chpt can remember even after a
66:01 - long conversation what the weather was
66:04 - Etc and then chpt will be able to show
66:07 - that back to the user so that's an
66:08 - example of how you could build a program
66:10 - with
66:11 - it but that the coding part right the
66:14 - API part and tasks part all of that will
66:16 - be handled automatically so here's what
66:19 - we're going to do because I have a
66:20 - meeting right now we're going to turn
66:22 - this into part one so said this is part
66:25 - one of end of
66:27 - programming and you know especially with
66:30 - large language models there and if you
66:32 - enjoyed it let me know and comment below
66:35 - asking part two okay if you comment
66:38 - below part two I will drop part two of
66:41 - this because they'll tell me you guys
66:42 - are looking forward to that and outside
66:44 - of that I just want to let you know
66:46 - again if you want to build apps with AI
66:49 - and chat
66:51 - GPT we're doing that okay we have so
66:55 - many students that if I go you the wins
66:57 - they're building their apps we just had
66:59 - a student built his first app 16 hours
67:01 - ago we have all these other students
67:03 - that are building their own apps right
67:05 - we have a huge Community we have
67:07 - students who are not only building their
67:10 - first app but actually even selling
67:12 - their first app and so Kyle actually
67:15 - made his first sale of the app that he
67:17 - built right and we have these students
67:20 - building these apps within minutes at
67:24 - times and the the results of all of them
67:27 - are absolutely incredible and the list
67:29 - just goes on right like Helm goes I
67:32 - finished the first app in about 30
67:33 - minutes so if you want to get these
67:36 - skills and learn exactly like these
67:38 - students did right Janette goes my dream
67:41 - was to be a programmer I'm 52 and I've
67:43 - not made that dream a reality and one
67:45 - day with this program I built my first
67:46 - app so if you want to learn how to do
67:48 - that I put together a free training for
67:50 - you click the link below and go watch
67:53 - that training absolutely unbelievable
67:55 - it's only 19 minutes long and it has the
67:57 - potential to change your entire life so
68:00 - I recommend go click that watch it I
68:03 - love your beautiful face and I'll see
68:05 - you you you in the next video peace
