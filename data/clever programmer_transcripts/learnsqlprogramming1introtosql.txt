00:00 - hey guys what's up this is Kazi from
00:03 - clever programmer dot-com does the
00:07 - website go check it out
00:09 - by the time you're watching this I
00:11 - probably will have the sequel course up
00:12 - on the website so you can just click
00:14 - probably in view all courses and then
00:17 - take it from here and the benefit of
00:19 - taking it from here would be that it'll
00:22 - be all integrated like you're on Netflix
00:24 - or something right it'll remember where
00:26 - you left off and everything but not to
00:29 - worry for taking it on youtube you will
00:31 - be just fine
00:32 - also it feels a little bit weird because
00:34 - we haven't been doing coding tutorials
00:36 - or coding videos in a while so this is
00:39 - going to be something fun now Before we
00:42 - jump right into it I want to go over a
00:44 - little bit of what sequel is about
00:47 - because I assume most of you who are
00:50 - watching this video know about it but if
00:51 - you don't don't worry I'll kind of
00:53 - explain it to you
00:54 - so sequel is basically like excel on
00:57 - steroids well what if you don't use
00:59 - Excel what it's what does it mean it
01:03 - lets you do really amazing things such
01:07 - as let's say you were working on an
01:10 - invoicing app which is something that I
01:12 - worked with in a while ago which is not
01:14 - so awesome but it let me query the
01:18 - results so I would type in somebody's
01:21 - name and then it would like make the
01:23 - table look beautiful and then it would
01:24 - pop up everybody in the right order how
01:28 - I had stored it in sequel that's not so
01:31 - cool but what is something that's much
01:34 - cooler how about when you are on Google
01:37 - and you type in something and then your
01:39 - search results are sorted in the right
01:41 - way
01:42 - that's sequel what if you were making a
01:44 - game Call of Duty the leaderboard yeah
01:48 - buddy
01:48 - that's sequel what if you were making
01:51 - and doing some financial data analysis a
01:53 - lot of the stuff that's going on in the
01:55 - backend is being done queried by sequel
01:58 - how many bullets do you have left in
02:00 - your gun how does the game calculate
02:02 - that so lots of the things in the
02:05 - backend are being done by sequel and you
02:08 - might actually not even see that with
02:10 - your own eyes so it's probably
02:13 - the most powerful most important thing
02:16 - that I ever ever learned after learning
02:19 - Python and this is the secret this is
02:24 - the thing that you need before you can
02:26 - actually start making really useful web
02:29 - apps so I mean the next step would be
02:33 - like intro to relational databases but
02:35 - you can't work with databases unless you
02:37 - know a little bit about how sequel works
02:40 - and then everything else is just like
02:42 - okay sequel sequel Lite my sequel
02:45 - Postgres Oracle Microsoft like that all
02:47 - fall under the same spectrum and
02:49 - everybody makes sequel and this thing
02:51 - seems so complicated
02:52 - guys it's really not it's so simple and
02:55 - once you learn it you can create really
02:58 - powerful things that are going to be
03:00 - helpful to you for all you practical
03:02 - folks knowing sequel allowed me to build
03:06 - something for just one of my clients I
03:09 - was able to charge over 1015 thousand
03:12 - dollars for the app that I made with
03:14 - Python using sequel combined ok and
03:17 - that's not even talking about other
03:19 - places that I got to use it in my own
03:22 - life making a fun app for my friends for
03:26 - example so it's pretty cool hopefully
03:32 - you might find some benefits that are
03:34 - useful if I've overlooked some go ahead
03:36 - and put them down so other people who
03:37 - are viewing this video can see those too
03:39 - and let's jump into it this resource
03:44 - that I'm using is called sequel Bolcom
03:46 - why am I using it because it's one of
03:48 - the most interactive ways to use sequel
03:50 - most people will show you some really
03:53 - weird way to go on like have your own
03:58 - server and like you need to spend money
04:00 - and get a subscription with Bluehost or
04:02 - whatever that's not what we're doing
04:04 - we're just using interactive one okay
04:06 - cool so you can read about this also on
04:10 - your own but I'm not going to bore bore
04:12 - you and read through a lot of this we're
04:14 - going to just start writing some
04:15 - interactive queries and you guys will
04:17 - kind of understand it as we go along
04:18 - okay cool so in sequel everything starts
04:24 - again you can combine sequel with PI
04:27 - so later one of my courses is going to
04:30 - cover how to build apps with Python so
04:34 - what you've learned from my Opie course
04:36 - I'm going to combine it with Python okay
04:40 - so the object-oriented part of the
04:42 - programming we're going to take it
04:44 - online and then to do a lot of heavy
04:47 - lifting on back-end we're going to be
04:48 - using sequels so I want you know you're
04:51 - not just learning it for random no
04:53 - reason it's going to be very helpful in
04:55 - building massively cool important
04:59 - projects okay that are either fun for
05:02 - you video games or whatever and also
05:05 - practical like bringing you in money
05:08 - okay working as a freelancer working as
05:11 - an independent software consultant or
05:13 - going and applying at a job and being
05:15 - hired as a data analyst or whatnot okay
05:18 - because Excel yeah they might pay you to
05:21 - be an expert on that but come on sequel
05:23 - is a big boy leak right or the big girl
05:25 - League cool okay so the first thing is
05:31 - always like select okay that's like
05:33 - almost always the first thing you do
05:35 - because we're selecting something star
05:37 - means everything so this is saying
05:40 - select everything okay that's what this
05:42 - part is saying and what this part is
05:44 - saying is saying from movie so this is
05:46 - the table the table is movies right you
05:48 - see the name of the table is called
05:50 - movies so we're saying select everything
05:52 - from movies and hence you see everything
05:54 - you see the column ID with everything in
05:56 - there title with everything in there
05:58 - director with everything in there so on
06:00 - and so forth okay so now let's change
06:07 - this okay
06:09 - to what they're asking us to do so
06:11 - they're saying exercise one is about
06:13 - tasks find the title of each film okay
06:17 - how would I do that right now I'm doing
06:20 - select everything from movies if you do
06:25 - a column name if you select a column
06:27 - name then it will only show you that
06:28 - column so instead of select star what
06:32 - should we say title if you're watching
06:36 - this go to sequel Bolcom right now and
06:40 - follow along don't
06:41 - lazy learner tone just watch me please
06:43 - do it everything will seem really easy
06:45 - when I do it when you do it it will be
06:47 - more difficult also you will remember it
06:50 - and so then you can actually use it for
06:51 - things and again sequel is just one of
06:55 - those things that in the start you don't
06:58 - know how to exactly use it with the
07:00 - things which with the things that you
07:02 - have so right now I'm going to have you
07:04 - use an interactive online world but then
07:07 - I'm going to help you combine it with
07:09 - some real application that you're
07:11 - building on your computer or on a web
07:13 - app okay so don't worry about that don't
07:15 - have lots of these doubts cut them out
07:19 - and then come in here and focus because
07:22 - I'm going to lead you to the amazing
07:25 - parts of it okay I'm not just going to
07:27 - show you interactive and then leave you
07:29 - hanging and we won't be able to actually
07:30 - use it anything all right so we got this
07:36 - down that's beautiful how do i do
07:38 - director of each film I think you guys
07:40 - know the answer to that I want to give
07:42 - it a try okay
07:44 - director alright and you can see that
07:49 - it's only showing it's only showing me
07:51 - that column perfect find the title and
07:55 - director so if I go up here in the notes
07:58 - you'll see it will show you how to
08:00 - actually do it select column comma
08:04 - another column so we're going to come
08:07 - here director comma what say it with me
08:11 - what is it beautiful so now we only have
08:16 - two columns director and title because
08:18 - we don't need any of that other stuff so
08:20 - that's it alright find the title and
08:24 - year you think you can do that I think
08:27 - you can do that here simple we're done
08:31 - with tasks for how do I let me quickly
08:35 - quiz you I want to see what level you're
08:37 - at okay so answer this out loud or try
08:40 - to type it in you're on your sequel
08:43 - Bolcom okay how do you show me
08:46 - everything if I want to see everything
08:48 - ID column your column title column
08:50 - director column everything how do I do
08:52 - it if you set star
08:54 - beautiful my friend oh I was trying to
08:58 - go backwards and quiz you but that ended
09:00 - up being the fifth task so in my country
09:05 - they call it a double whammy
09:07 - all right so I gave you a little bit of
09:10 - overview of how it's going to be
09:12 - massively useful in your real life
09:15 - hopefully I've clarified some objections
09:17 - you might have lingering in the back of
09:18 - your head I knew I did when I was taking
09:20 - some of these guys's courses like Eli
09:22 - the computer guards a New Boston or
09:24 - whatnot and I was like no yeah they're
09:26 - teaching me but are they going to help
09:28 - me actually build something with it or
09:30 - are they just literally teaching me and
09:33 - then I'm kind of left to my own devices
09:36 - so hopefully I've clarified those
09:39 - objections in your brain so you can
09:41 - focus and learn and that's my most
09:45 - important goal that you understand what
09:47 - sequel will be useful to you for okay if
09:49 - there's any confusion comment below and
09:51 - jump in there and answer to you okay
09:53 - I'll also try to hold some live sessions
09:56 - where we do this together and I'll
09:59 - clarify any big-picture question you
10:01 - have we're in technical question you
10:03 - have and then we kind of went through
10:05 - the basic basic part of it okay so in
10:08 - the next video we're going to continue
10:10 - go on to the next part okay that's it
10:13 - for this video guys give them a little
10:15 - like give them a little tweet send them
10:17 - who's tell them who sent you or whatever
10:20 - and it that's just cool okay guys I love
10:23 - you guys so much take care and I'll see
10:25 - you in the next video
