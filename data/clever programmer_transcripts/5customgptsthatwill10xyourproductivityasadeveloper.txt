00:00 - these are the top five gpts that will
00:02 - help you 10x your productivity as a
00:04 - developer GPT Store launched last month
00:07 - and there are thousands of gpts in the
00:09 - store already first of all you need to
00:12 - be a chat GPT plus subscriber it's $20 a
00:15 - month and it's so worth it because the
00:16 - output of GPT 4 versus the free GPT 3.5
00:21 - is like comparing the intelligence of a
00:22 - 6-year-old kid to a fully grown
00:24 - 30-year-old adult it's also multimodal
00:27 - so it's capable of analyzing text images
00:30 - and voice instead of just plain text and
00:33 - with chat GPT plus you also get access
00:35 - to these special gpts that can boost
00:37 - your coding productivity now before we
00:39 - get into the video I have some exciting
00:41 - news for you all that we've put together
00:43 - an entirely free 20-minute webinar
00:45 - training designed to guide you in
00:47 - becoming a developer with AI you're
00:49 - going to learn how to enhance your
00:51 - efficiency and speed up your development
00:53 - process using tools like chat GPT and in
00:56 - this free training we're going to give
00:57 - you three Innovative AI app Concepts
00:59 - steps that you can build in under 5
01:02 - minutes with the power of AI so click on
01:04 - the sign up link in the description
01:05 - below and make sure you check out this
01:07 - free webinar all right let's get into
01:09 - these top five developer
01:14 - gpts our first GPT is screenshot to code
01:18 - and hence the name this helps you write
01:20 - front-end code from just a screenshot so
01:23 - you can take a screenshot of literally
01:25 - any website you want so to try this out
01:28 - let's just take a screenshot of the
01:30 - YouTube
01:33 - homepage so we'll just grab that and
01:36 - then we can upload it to the GPT here
01:41 - cuz remember GPT 4 is multimodal so
01:44 - you're able to give it input that's not
01:46 - just plain text so we're going to give
01:48 - it this image of the YouTube homepage
01:50 - and then the prompt that will'll add
01:51 - will just say build
01:54 - this using Tailwind CSS and we'll just
01:57 - see what it gives us from this prompt so
02:00 - it takes just maybe about a minute there
02:01 - and it has given us this whole HTML code
02:05 - that we can use to create the layout of
02:08 - the screenshot that we gave it it says
02:10 - this code provides the structure for a
02:11 - video streaming platform UI inspired by
02:13 - this inspired by the screenshot it
02:16 - doesn't cover every detail but it gives
02:17 - you a solid base to start from and you
02:20 - can fill in the placeholder images with
02:22 - whatever images you want so let's just
02:24 - take this and throw it right directly
02:26 - into a repet um file and if you're not
02:29 - Amil with repit it's just basically an
02:31 - in browser IDE so we can just put our
02:33 - code in right here and see the output
02:35 - right away we don't have to do any other
02:37 - setup okay so I'm literally just going
02:39 - to copy this and paste it right here we
02:42 - have an HTML JavaScript and CSS
02:45 - environment template selected because
02:47 - this is just plain HTML that it gave us
02:50 - and it uses Tailwind if you look right
02:52 - up here in the scripts in the head we
02:55 - can see that the Tailwind CDN script is
02:58 - linked right here so that's how how
02:59 - we're able to use this Tailwind styling
03:02 - you can see here in the classes so let's
03:05 - just run this look at
03:07 - that move myself over here a little bit
03:10 - so you can see so it gave
03:13 - us a nice little layout for this
03:16 - obviously like it said you know this is
03:18 - just the base and you build up from here
03:20 - but this is a nice little YouTube
03:22 - homepage clone that you could start from
03:24 - and create your own project screenshot
03:27 - to code is super useful because this
03:29 - could really help you with rapid
03:30 - prototyping you can get an MVP built
03:33 - from design files much faster than
03:35 - before this GPT could also be used to
03:38 - help teach beginner programmers how the
03:41 - structure for a different front end
03:42 - should be set up and you could
03:44 - potentially even use this to help you
03:46 - build your own UI component
03:51 - Library the code co-pilot GPT is
03:54 - designed to help you with Python
03:56 - Programming this can help you with code
03:58 - review okay it can review code you've
04:00 - written you can get help with debugging
04:03 - from this GPT and it can even help to
04:05 - teach you Python Programming best
04:07 - practices so how does this work well we
04:10 - have the GPT open right here and it has
04:12 - some example commands to start with so
04:14 - we're just going to start with the first
04:15 - one they have/ start Python and it tells
04:18 - us a little bit about code co-pilot and
04:21 - what you can do so it's here to assist
04:23 - you with writing efficient readable
04:25 - reusable and maintainable python code so
04:27 - this it can help you with API
04:29 - documentation
04:30 - writing new code Snippets whatever you
04:32 - need with python basically so to get
04:34 - started with it all we need to do is
04:36 - just share a specific python coding
04:37 - challenge or some example code that we
04:39 - wanted to explain to us so I have here a
04:43 - sample of python webd project this is
04:47 - using the D Jango rest framework and I'm
04:50 - just going to take a code from a random
04:52 - file in this
04:54 - repository and I'm going to give this to
04:58 - code co-pilot I'm just just going to ask
05:00 - it to explain this code for
05:04 - me that's all I'm going to say and I'll
05:08 - paste the code right there some of these
05:11 - you might notice it takes a little bit
05:13 - longer because it's using gp4 which is a
05:16 - much larger model and it's doing a much
05:18 - more advanced response for us so we have
05:20 - to have a little bit longer of a wait
05:22 - time so this one did give us a pretty
05:24 - detailed response it's basically
05:26 - explaining to us that this code is for a
05:29 - class for a Blog application um that's
05:33 - being used to serialize post data to and
05:36 - from a Json format so this is for a
05:38 - Jango rest API that needs to format data
05:41 - for the response and then it breaks it
05:43 - down for us into really detailed pieces
05:46 - so it tells us we have the Imports at
05:48 - the beginning of our code right and then
05:51 - we Define the class constructs the API
05:53 - URL we use our models we have serializer
05:57 - metadata and then finally we have the
05:59 - method that takes the post object as
06:01 - input and Returns the full API URL for
06:03 - the object so if you tried to look at
06:05 - this just by yourself it's obviously
06:07 - following rest API conventions but you
06:09 - might miss something or maybe you are
06:11 - not that familiar with python and now
06:13 - you read this and you're like oh I
06:15 - understand what's going on now with the
06:16 - Jango framework API I know what this
06:19 - syntax means in this context code
06:22 - co-pilot is an awesome tool for
06:24 - beginners if you have trouble
06:26 - understanding Snippets of code you can
06:27 - input that into this GP and it's going
06:30 - to explain it for you find a bug in your
06:32 - code and you're not sure what to do code
06:34 - co-pilot can help you figure out how to
06:36 - fix it so go have fun with this one and
06:38 - see if you can test the limits of what
06:40 - this can
06:43 - do our next GPT is ask the code and this
06:47 - one has a really interesting use case
06:50 - ask the code is specifically designed to
06:54 - help you get an understanding of a
06:56 - GitHub repository so all we have to do
06:58 - is provide a GitHub repository URL and
07:01 - we can ask about any aspect of the code
07:04 - in that repository and it's going to
07:05 - explain to us what's going on and what
07:08 - we need to know okay so I came across
07:10 - this repository by Apple um for their
07:13 - own project called ml faret I have no
07:16 - idea what's going on in this repository
07:19 - I see some animals looks kind of
07:20 - interesting so I'm just going to copy
07:23 - the link to this repository and then in
07:26 - the GPT I'm just going to feed it this
07:29 - rep repository The Prompt will give it
07:31 - I'll just
07:33 - say
07:35 - explain what
07:37 - this repository is like I'm
07:42 - 12 so for this we're going to have to
07:44 - authorize it to use our GitHub account
07:48 - authorized so this GPT just uses a
07:50 - specific plug-in and we have to all
07:52 - we're doing here is uh the reason we
07:54 - have to sign in with ooth is just to
07:56 - give it permission to be able to
07:57 - communicate with this plugin so so it
07:59 - can give us the response back that we
08:01 - want so I'm just going to allow that so
08:03 - it tells us the GitHub repository ml
08:06 - faret is about a project called fret
08:08 - imagine the Fret is a super smart robot
08:10 - that can understand and talk about
08:11 - anything you see in a picture that can
08:14 - point out and describe things in the
08:16 - picture using words just like we do this
08:18 - is really cool because it means far can
08:20 - help computers understand pictures and
08:21 - text in a way that's never been done
08:23 - before so you can see it's kind of using
08:25 - language here that's making this so
08:27 - simple that anybody could understand
08:29 - because we asked it to talk to explain
08:31 - it like I'm 12 so it's really making
08:34 - this super easy to understand it says
08:36 - faret is really smart at pointing and
08:37 - talking about things in pictures it
08:39 - learns from a huge collection of
08:41 - examples and it's tested on lots of
08:43 - different tasks so basically this is an
08:45 - AI that has been trained on a large set
08:49 - of images so that it can identify items
08:53 - in new images that you give it so this
08:55 - is pretty cool but how could this be
08:57 - useful to us let's let's just ask ask
09:01 - the
09:02 - code
09:06 - how how can I use this
09:09 - myself check this out it told us how we
09:12 - can install fret on your own computer
09:15 - and then how you can actually train it
09:18 - yourself as long as you have the Basic
09:20 - Hardware requirements you can train data
09:22 - on Apple's machine learning fet yourself
09:26 - so now that we know what this is and how
09:28 - we can actually run it ourselves let's
09:30 - take it one step further let's ask it
09:35 - um give
09:37 - me some
09:39 - projects I could
09:42 - build using this project it actually
09:46 - gave us six different project ideas that
09:48 - we could build with this build a
09:50 - platform for artwork that gives
09:52 - historical context analysis around it
09:55 - that'd be pretty cool develop an app for
09:58 - researchers and conservationists to
10:00 - upload images of animals and plants to
10:02 - identify the species build a smart home
10:05 - system a game that players can upload
10:07 - pictures and fret will generate stories
10:09 - and quests based on the objects and the
10:11 - scenes it detects that would be really
10:13 - cool so I guess actually under each one
10:15 - of these subjects is two different app
10:17 - ideas that could be an educational tool
10:20 - or an accessibility enhancement so if
10:23 - you are someone that has trouble
10:24 - thinking about what projects to build
10:26 - like you know you want to build
10:27 - something but you don't know what you
10:29 - should build literally 12 different AI
10:32 - project ideas that you could build using
10:35 - this ask the code GPT there are so many
10:38 - things you could do with this ask the
10:39 - code GPT you could use it to help you
10:42 - learn new open- source projects and
10:44 - figure out where you might be able to
10:45 - make a contribution you could find
10:47 - projects you could build yourself to add
10:49 - to your resume and increase your chances
10:51 - of Landing your dream job the
10:53 - opportunities with a tool like this are
10:55 - really
10:58 - endless
10:59 - next up we have flow bite and you can
11:02 - use this for frontend prompt so that you
11:04 - don't have to write any code by yourself
11:07 - we're here in flowy all we have to do is
11:09 - come up with a prompt that describes
11:11 - what we want it to build so the prompt
11:13 - I'm going to give it is help me build a
11:15 - simple blog following the versel design
11:18 - system and following the substack blog
11:20 - post structure in Tailwind CSS tell it
11:23 - to use the CDN and JavaScript so we
11:26 - thought hey it might be cool to build a
11:29 - simple little blog where we can put some
11:31 - posts out there we know that we like the
11:33 - versel design system and the way that
11:35 - substack blog post are structur so we're
11:37 - going to tell it to copy those systems
11:40 - and then we want to use Tailwind CSS
11:42 - again making sure that we use the CDN
11:44 - like we did before so it's linked in the
11:46 - head the script tag so we can just paste
11:49 - this into repet and of course want to
11:52 - build this with Java Script all right so
11:54 - it gave us the basic code structure that
11:57 - we're going to need and then it tells us
11:59 - a little bit about the code and the
12:00 - steps it says here's the basic HTML
12:03 - template that contains the header the
12:05 - content area and the footer it's going
12:07 - to be structured to resemble substack
12:09 - layout like we told it then it's using
12:11 - Tailwind CSS CDN Link in the head like
12:13 - we specified for it to do and then it's
12:15 - telling us that this is a basic
12:17 - responsive layout if we want to further
12:19 - customize the design to more closely
12:21 - match vel's Aesthetics like we mentioned
12:23 - to it in the prompt or add more advanced
12:25 - stuff it tells us how we can extend uh
12:28 - on top of is to do that so let's copy
12:31 - what they gave us and let's see what it
12:33 - looks
12:34 - like we will get rid
12:37 - of what we have in here for the YouTube
12:41 - homepage and we'll just replace it with
12:44 - our blog website so this looks like it's
12:47 - still missing some of the Tailwind
12:49 - styling I feel like maybe this is not
12:51 - correctly importing the CDN like we did
12:53 - before let's just see if it can fix it
12:55 - for us let's see if it's smart enough to
12:57 - do it no I don't think think I don't
12:59 - think it's quite right on that piece of
13:01 - it if I replace this with a better CDN
13:06 - link yeah then we're going to get what
13:08 - we want and we're going to see those
13:09 - flow bite components so this one we had
13:12 - to tweak it just a little bit but it did
13:14 - give us a really nice layout to start
13:17 - with all of the HTML that we needed and
13:20 - this is why it's still important as a
13:21 - developer to know your tools and know
13:23 - what tools you like to use so that you
13:24 - can recogn recognize those small little
13:27 - mistakes with gpts and just tweak them
13:29 - to get exactly what you want with the
13:31 - minimal amount of effort flowy has some
13:34 - similar use cases to screenshot to code
13:36 - with rapid prototyping and building a
13:38 - design system for your project but it's
13:40 - based on a specific component Library
13:42 - called flowy not sponsored but this
13:45 - Library can help you generate a really
13:47 - pretty looking app in record
13:51 - time our final GPT is designer GPT so
13:55 - let's compare this with the last one
13:57 - because this one is similar but it
13:59 - actually takes it one step ahead and
14:01 - does the deployment for you which is
14:03 - pretty amazing that we could give this
14:05 - just one prompt and have actually a live
14:08 - functional site that people could really
14:11 - access and use deployment can be one of
14:13 - the most annoying pieces of web
14:15 - development so having that taken care of
14:16 - for us by this GPT would be amazing so
14:19 - let's try a personal blog with this one
14:21 - and see if it does better than flow bite
14:24 - for the prompt we'll say design a
14:26 - personal blog layout make it in the
14:29 - style of medium.com cuz that's a popular
14:33 - blog site set it up with
14:37 - eight sample blog posts with different
14:41 - titles all right let's see what we can
14:43 - do with this okay so like here's the
14:45 - pieces that it's going to structure it
14:47 - with I'll now proceed to create the HTML
14:49 - code for this layout once it's ready
14:51 - I'll send it to create the actual web
14:53 - page send
14:55 - it okay HTML is done it's putting some
14:59 - actual JavaScript function in this one
15:03 - okay code is done it's now sending this
15:05 - to create a web page and it's going to
15:07 - give us the link to view it okay once
15:10 - again it's going to need us to give it
15:12 - permissions it wants to talk to repet
15:14 - this time so we can see our live project
15:17 - so I'm just going to confirm permissions
15:19 - for that and our personal blog layout is
15:21 - now live it says if we encounter any
15:24 - issues or want to make adjustments
15:26 - please let me know how I can assist you
15:28 - further all right let's try just
15:29 - clicking this link and
15:31 - see wow this is pretty sweet this is a
15:35 - live website right now you could go to
15:37 - this URL and check this out so this is a
15:41 - great starting point obviously you would
15:43 - have you know work to do with a little
15:46 - more styling and with these posts you
15:48 - would want to make them like go to uh
15:51 - the actual post when you click on it and
15:53 - all that but hey designer GPT did tell
15:56 - you that you can it's happy to assist
15:58 - you further so you could just ask it how
16:01 - to do that and it would give you the
16:02 - code and give you the steps and get it
16:04 - deployed for you and literally without
16:06 - having to write any code you could just
16:08 - type in I want to be able to click on
16:09 - the art of making coffee and see a page
16:11 - with actual blog post and just like that
16:14 - you'd be able to have a place to host
16:17 - that blog on your live site so this is
16:19 - pretty cool we have a fully hosted web
16:22 - app from designer GPT designer GPT would
16:25 - be a great tool to use to help you learn
16:27 - to write clean code for all of your
16:29 - project builds it could also be really
16:31 - useful for creating your developer
16:33 - portfolio just give it all the
16:35 - information you want to include about
16:37 - yourself and it's going to get you up
16:38 - and running right away all right those
16:40 - are the top five gpts that will help you
16:42 - 10x your productivity as a developer now
16:45 - if you're ready to go a step further and
16:47 - learn how to build your own custom gpts
16:50 - don't forget we've created that
16:51 - complimentary webinar training that's
16:53 - going to help you become an AI developer
16:55 - in 20 minutes you'll get three different
16:57 - Cutting Edge AI app IDE is that you'll
16:59 - be able to build on your own in under 5
17:01 - minutes thanks to leveraging tools like
17:03 - chat gbt to streamline your development
17:05 - workflow so click that registration Link
17:07 - in the description and make sure you
17:09 - catch this training so which one of
17:11 - these gpts we tested out was your
17:12 - favorite let me know in the comments
17:14 - below and I'll see you in another video
