00:00 - top five programming languages for you
00:02 - to learn in 2023 to get a job without
00:05 - needing a college degree I do these
00:07 - videos every few years and they get
00:09 - millions of views and you guys seem to
00:11 - love them so here we go again we're
00:13 - going to be ranking these languages on
00:15 - three main factors number one the time
00:17 - it takes even for an absolute beginner
00:20 - to learn and build real world projects
00:22 - number two salary and the demand for
00:25 - this programming language number three
00:27 - productivity or the development cost and
00:30 - time so let's just get straight into it
00:32 - number five Java so object oriented
00:35 - programming language is best known for
00:37 - Android application development so
00:39 - anytime you see an Android and there are
00:41 - apps on there you know that they were
00:43 - built with Java Java is used on over
00:45 - three billion devices worldwide
00:48 - including mobile phones tablets laptops
00:51 - and desktops Java has a large and active
00:54 - community of over 9 million developers
00:56 - if you ever need help or your loss will
00:58 - always be able to find help Java is also
00:59 - known for its right once run everywhere
01:02 - philosophy which essentially means any
01:04 - machine that has a Java virtual machine
01:07 - installed on there can run Java the one
01:09 - con I would say with Java is that
01:11 - learning curve is harder have to learn
01:13 - classes you have to learn
01:15 - object-oriented programming my personal
01:16 - opinion is functional programming is
01:18 - much easier to learn and it's the way
01:20 - moving forward so if you're a complete
01:21 - beginner it'll take you longer to learn
01:23 - Java than other programming languages
01:25 - and the average salary of a Java
01:27 - developer is a hundred and seven
01:29 - thousand dollars per year number four
01:32 - Swift swift is best known for building
01:36 - iOS or iPhone applications when you
01:39 - think anything Apple MacBook iMac iPad
01:42 - an iPhone all of those devices the apps
01:45 - that are built on them are built using
01:46 - the programming language called Swift if
01:48 - you've ever wanted to be in the app
01:50 - store and have your apps and be able to
01:52 - make recurring income from the apps and
01:54 - you want it to ever be a mobile
01:55 - developer or mobile game developer or
01:57 - whatnot Swift is a programming language
01:59 - that you're like looking for when it
02:00 - comes to the iPhone world games like
02:02 - Clash of Clans or Angry Birds Flappy
02:05 - Bird all of those famous games that you
02:07 - might have played on an iPhone those
02:09 - were made with Swift swift is used by
02:11 - some of the biggest companies in the
02:12 - world for example Uber app that you know
02:14 - Lyft Facebook Instagram Airbnb or
02:18 - LinkedIn all of those apps that are on
02:20 - your devices they're built with swift
02:21 - con is I would say a bit similar to Java
02:24 - where it is a little bit more difficult
02:26 - for a complete absolute beginner to
02:28 - learn because now you have mobile
02:29 - development involved the average salary
02:31 - of a swift developer is a hundred and
02:34 - nineteen thousand dollars per year
02:36 - according to ZipRecruiter number three
02:38 - solidity it's best used and known for
02:42 - the ability to develop on the blockchain
02:44 - being able to make smart contract or
02:47 - dapps which stand for decentralized
02:50 - applications some of the biggest
02:51 - companies in the world are using
02:53 - solidity for example Twitter is using it
02:56 - for their nft functionality so you could
02:58 - actually add an nft AS your profile
03:00 - picture coinbase uses it openc is using
03:03 - it to be able to buy or sell or auction
03:05 - your nfts and Reddit is also using
03:08 - solidity you use solidity to primarily
03:10 - write code or write apps on the ethereum
03:13 - blockchain the programming syntax of
03:16 - this programming language is similar to
03:18 - that of java where it is mostly an
03:20 - object-oriented programming language a
03:22 - funny story I just want to share with
03:23 - you one of my friends Nas he has
03:24 - experience doing software development
03:26 - for multiple years so I'm going to add
03:28 - that disclaimer in there that he
03:29 - switched over spent a couple of months
03:31 - learning solidity and then he actually
03:32 - ended up starting to make twenty to
03:34 - thirty thousand dollars a month Landing
03:36 - clients for whom he would build projects
03:39 - using solidity so the salary you could
03:41 - make with it is definitely very high and
03:43 - very different than some of the other
03:44 - programming languages because something
03:46 - that's new and it's very needed in the
03:48 - cryptocurrency world the average salary
03:50 - of a developer is a hundred and fifty
03:53 - six thousand dollars a year but again
03:55 - like I said the drawback of it is the
03:58 - difficulty and the complexity of
03:59 - learning it if you could overcome that
04:01 - and yes you do create a pretty big
04:03 - opportunity for yourself number two
04:05 - python python is one of my most favorite
04:08 - programming languages that this was the
04:11 - programming language I used to start my
04:14 - Learning Journey it's by far one of the
04:16 - easiest programming languages and out of
04:19 - all the ones I'll list today it's
04:20 - definitely the easiest so the learning
04:22 - curve for a complete beginner is very
04:24 - low and you can learn it it reads like
04:26 - English it's beautiful to look at and
04:29 - then the opportunity for developers is
04:32 - great the job market is great the types
04:34 - of jobs that you would be doing as a
04:36 - python developer would be along the
04:38 - lines of machine learning data science
04:40 - analytics you could do web development
04:42 - with it as well those are the types of
04:44 - routes that you would likely go if you
04:46 - went down the route of python and some
04:47 - of the biggest companies use Python
04:49 - Google Dropbox or uh Netflix YouTube
04:53 - Instagram any other big companies use
04:55 - Python and the average salary of a
04:57 - python developer is a hundred and
05:00 - seventeen thousand dollars according to
05:02 - indeed.com and number one JavaScript not
05:06 - to be confused with Java this
05:08 - programming language is used pretty much
05:10 - on every single website on the planet
05:12 - all web apps are built using JavaScript
05:15 - YouTube Facebook Instagram all the big
05:18 - ones so for example if you're on YouTube
05:20 - and you click that like button that
05:22 - functionality is added using JavaScript
05:23 - if you are on spotify's website and you
05:26 - click the play button that's powered by
05:27 - JavaScript the sound that you hear is
05:29 - powered by JavaScript so pretty much
05:31 - everything that you use and interact
05:33 - with you click on a website and a drop
05:35 - down menu pops up that's JavaScript the
05:37 - type of roles you could expect as a
05:38 - JavaScript developer are front-end
05:40 - developer or a full stack developer
05:43 - imagine you're a developer at Netflix
05:44 - and then you're building out their
05:46 - mobile platform or you're building out
05:48 - their web platform or all of the tiles
05:50 - and beautiful visuals are showing up or
05:52 - the animations are showing up or when
05:54 - you click that button you hear the you
05:56 - know the Netflix sound that plays
05:58 - JavaScript is also one of the easiest
06:00 - programming languages to learn now I
06:02 - think now more than before because of
06:04 - how much functional programming they're
06:06 - now integrating into JavaScript it's
06:08 - becoming really easy to read and write
06:10 - and becoming really high levels
06:12 - especially if you look at the new
06:13 - JavaScript es6 syntax basically if you
06:15 - don't know that means that's okay all
06:16 - that means is it's now very easy to use
06:19 - average salary of a JavaScript developer
06:22 - according to indeed.com is a hundred and
06:24 - fifteen thousand dollars per year and
06:26 - one of the biggest reasons I recommend
06:28 - for you to learn it is the Opportunities
06:30 - Unlimited pretty much in any field with
06:33 - JavaScript it's the fastest growing and
06:36 - the biggest most popular programming
06:38 - language with the biggest community in
06:40 - the world so to break into the industry
06:42 - whereas for example say python with data
06:44 - science or machine learning that might
06:45 - take you years but with full stack
06:47 - development you could get in within six
06:49 - months nine months and before people
06:51 - start bashing me on this video which is
06:53 - so annoying what I will say is in my
06:55 - opinion because I've personally done
06:58 - this I did it with python within a
07:00 - couple of months I learned web
07:02 - development and I was able to get a job
07:04 - as a python web developer for making six
07:06 - figures per year within my first three
07:08 - to six months of learning to code but
07:09 - again massive disclaimer for people
07:11 - start whining and crying in the comments
07:13 - section is I was coding for 12 to 15
07:15 - hours per day that's why I was able to
07:18 - get there that fast most people will not
07:20 - be able to do that I was able to just
07:22 - work from home be supported with my
07:24 - parents and then just code up the whole
07:26 - time but I think that if I were to do it
07:28 - again I would do it with JavaScript just
07:29 - because of the growth and the
07:30 - opportunity that exists with it now
07:32 - within three to six months of you going
07:34 - all in it's very possible you could get
07:36 - your first job not making a hundred
07:38 - thousand dollars but you might be making
07:40 - sixty seventy thousand dollars a year
07:42 - there are people who get 200 and again
07:44 - those are some statistical anomalies
07:46 - this is my experience after being in the
07:48 - industry for over eight years teaching
07:49 - millions of students how to code having
07:51 - thousands and thousands of students get
07:53 - jobs as Developers for example take Ali
07:56 - who started working with us and within a
07:58 - couple of months from not knowing
08:00 - anything she learned JavaScript and then
08:02 - went on to get her first job making 90
08:05 - 000 dollars per year take Frank Ramos
08:08 - who shot up his salary 200 000 per year
08:11 - or Devin gray who landed a job at PayPal
08:13 - one of my students actually just
08:15 - recently ran into I was at a conference
08:17 - at vid Summit and he told me a crazy
08:19 - story of how he went from being
08:21 - completely homeless to getting a job at
08:24 - Google within four months after he
08:26 - started watching my coding tutorials and
08:28 - learning JavaScript this is why I'm
08:29 - recommending you start with JavaScript
08:31 - because it's worked with so many
08:32 - students and if you want to be able to
08:34 - learn it at even a faster Pace I do have
08:36 - a coaching program that you could sign
08:37 - up for link is in the description below
08:39 - get on a call with my team apply for it
08:41 - we'll give you a ton of value and if
08:42 - it's a good fit I'll let you know and if
08:44 - it's not I'll also let you know
08:45 - regardless you'll leave a ton of value
08:48 - even after that if you decide it's not
08:49 - for you I have hundreds of hours of free
08:51 - training material online you are welcome
08:53 - to use and master JavaScript I hope you
08:55 - enjoyed this video peace
