00:00 - - Hey guys, what is up?
00:01 - How's it going?
00:02 - This is Qazi from cleverprogrammer.com.
00:06 - In this video, we're
gonna be talking about
00:09 - the best course on Python
that is absolutely free,
00:14 - so without any further ado,
let's jump right into it.
00:18 - (techno music)
00:31 - Alright, so I feel like I
talk about this all the time,
00:36 - but maybe it's your first
time to this channel.
00:38 - If it is, the note of this channel
00:40 - is about learning computer programming,
00:43 - and it's about learning a
programming language called Python
00:46 - and learning how to do web development.
00:48 - Also, at the end of this video
00:50 - I've got something phenominal for you,
00:53 - which trust me, you do not want to miss
00:55 - so stick through it, okay?
00:57 - Now, when it comes to Python
and computer programming,
01:02 - there are a lot of courses, okay?
01:04 - I've mentioned those resources
like Udacity, Coursera,
01:09 - blah blah blah, lots of them.
01:11 - But the one that I want to mention to you
01:12 - that I think is the best
for Python is called,
01:16 - go to cleverprogrammer.com. Okay?
01:19 - I've made this course for you.
01:22 - It's about learning Python
by building projects.
01:25 - The reason that I want
to do this for you is,
01:29 - I get that you don't have a lot of time.
01:32 - So, I wanted to make something for you
01:34 - that lets you learn Python
in the fastest way possible.
01:39 - And, as you build projects,
01:41 - but you have something to show
for it at the end of the day
01:44 - that keeps you motivated
01:45 - and you have that feedback
along the way. Okay?
01:49 - As you go.
01:50 - So, in this course, it's absolutely free.
01:54 - If you go to cleerprogramner.com,
01:57 - you can sign up for my free course. Okay?
01:59 - In the first five minutes of this course,
02:01 - you'll be building your
first project. Okay?
02:04 - How crazy is that? Right?
02:06 - Not a lot of courses have that.
02:08 - And my course is about taking
02:09 - not some crazy technical approach
02:12 - or working with numbers,
02:14 - we're working with things visually. Okay?
02:16 - Which means your eyes can see it
02:18 - so you can get that instant feedback,
02:20 - literally improve yourself,
become better. Okay?
02:24 - Because if you don't have that,
02:25 - it's very hard to improve
your skills. Okay?
02:27 - So, again, this course you
get interactive exercises,
02:30 - you get quizzes, you get projects
02:33 - so you have something to
show for it at the end.
02:36 - So definitely sign up for this course.
02:37 - Now, I have that special
announcement for you
02:40 - that I told you to stick around
02:42 - for the end of this video.
- Follow me on Instagram.
02:44 - - This is something that
- John Colors.
02:45 - - you don't wanna miss. Okay>
02:46 - I love this guy, follow him.
02:47 - The announcement that you don't wanna miss
02:50 - has to do with my web development
course for Python. Okay?
02:54 - This is flagship course that
we offer at Clever Programmer,
02:57 - and we have hundreds of students take it,
03:00 - and they have gotten successful,
amazing results. Okay?
03:04 - We have some students,
I'll try to put it up here,
03:06 - but one of the students is Dennis Murphy.
03:08 - He has now built his own platform
03:10 - and he's getting clients with
Python. Okay? Programming.
03:14 - So, this is something that
I want to now share with you
03:17 - where you can learn Python and
do web development with it.
03:21 - And if you're interested
in this course coming up,
03:24 - it's gonna come 2017, November.
03:27 - And then I'll keep launching
it again and again. Okay?
03:29 - If you're watching this video after 2017.
03:32 - This course is called
03:33 - Create Apps with Python
and Land Your First Client.
03:37 - So, what I want to do
is help you create apps
03:39 - as fast as possible and
get your first client
03:42 - as fast as possible in
less than 90 days. Okay?
03:45 - Because a lot of other
courses don't teach you
03:48 - how to get clients, how
to start making money,
03:50 - how to build a portfolio, how
to start creating projects,
03:53 - how to negotiate, how to
get a salary of up to five
03:56 - high five figures or six figures. Okay?
03:59 - This course is about putting
money in your pocket,
04:03 - it's not about taking
money out of your pocket
04:05 - and that's it.
04:06 - I'm not just gonna show
you some technical bullshit
04:08 - that you're gonna be working
with, something boring,
04:11 - some professor teaching you this,
04:12 - I am gonna teach this to you,
04:14 - not from some high moral ground,
04:15 - but like we're friends. Okay?
04:17 - And I wanna help you get clients with this
04:20 - as fast as possible because
that's what I'm good at
04:22 - and that's what I wanna share with you.
04:25 - So, I want you to start making
money as fast as possible.
04:27 - This is a web development
course for Python,
04:29 - for people who actually want
to make money with Python.
04:33 - Now, you know something
I've mentioned before,
04:35 - but Python is a very popular language.
04:37 - And companies like Instagram
were built off Python.
04:40 - Google, YouTube, Reddit,
Dropbox. Quora, Spotify, hipmunk,
04:47 - all of those companies
are built off of Python.
04:50 - So, there's no reason for
you to not learn this.
04:53 - And Python is super easy, it's trending,
04:56 - and you get to make the
most money doing this. Okay?
05:00 - So, it's a no brainer and to
