00:00 - hello there are my beautiful friends in
00:03 - this video I want to talk about who's
00:06 - the bigger guy this is Kazi from clever
00:08 - programmer calm and we're going to solve
00:10 - a pretty sick problem sick as in good
00:14 - now
00:16 - this problem essentially wants you to
00:19 - find max of two numbers so if I give you
00:24 - look at it look at line 19 if I give you
00:27 - one two you should return to if you give
00:31 - this function bigger guy function if you
00:32 - give it 10 and 20 it should return 20 if
00:35 - you give it 20 and 10 it should return
00:38 - 20 and if you give it 2 and 1 it should
00:41 - return to get the idea and
00:44 - same thing with the strings but you
00:46 - don't have to do anything special Python
00:48 - knows how to check strings against each
00:50 - other okay
00:51 - so let's code this up notes or below
00:55 - solution is below I think you guys know
00:57 - the drill at this point if you're
00:59 - watching this on YouTube that is if
01:01 - you're watching it on my website
01:02 - everything is going to be there in your
01:03 - face so
01:06 - first step d/f define we're writing a
01:10 - function that does this right look at
01:12 - the instructions write a function bigger
01:14 - guy so I know that I do this with my
01:16 - eyes closed now what is it taking it
01:19 - takes in two numbers so I know that it
01:21 - takes in two inputs I can say num1 num2
01:25 - or something okay and what can I do here
01:29 - well I want to check between those two
01:34 - numbers in whichever is the bigger one I
01:35 - want to return that number right so
01:39 - using if statements and comparison
01:41 - operators we can do all of this together
01:44 - if you haven't solved this yet or if you
01:47 - haven't tried to solve it on your own
01:49 - please don't watch this pause try the
01:53 - problem then come back but here's a
01:55 - solution for you guys for you eager
01:57 - beaver's
01:58 - if
02:02 - num 1 is greater than num to return num
02:08 - 1 right if num 1 is bigger well
02:11 - otherwise return num - right in the case
02:17 - where num 2 is equal to num 1 do we care
02:20 - which one we want to return of course
02:23 - not we don't care we just want to return
02:25 - any of them it doesn't matter okay to
02:27 - specify that for you guys here I'll be
02:30 - nice and I'll add in another test ok 10
02:33 - 10 it should return 10 I really don't
02:36 - care what it returns in the case where
02:38 - there two are the same okay and
02:40 - what if they are what if num 2 is the
02:44 - one that's greater well in either of
02:46 - those cases right the first case we
02:48 - return num 1 if it's the case where
02:51 - they're equal or if num 2 is greater we
02:53 - return num2 which is why we don't need
02:55 - to give a condition we just say else and
02:56 - we're done now
02:58 - let's
03:00 - let's check this bad boy and let's see
03:02 - how it works right let's let's give it
03:05 - some ok here I'll just do it to be extra
03:08 - tangible here for you guys right so
03:11 - let's let's do 3 5 it returns 5 let's
03:15 - give it 5 9 it returns 9 and if I gave
03:20 - it 5/5 it should return 5 right so
03:24 - we know what it does and here let's
03:28 - uncomment this line and when I run it it
03:31 - should say your code is correct which
03:33 - means that it passed all of these
03:34 - assertion tests and then at the end it
03:37 - said your code it then it went and said
03:40 - your code is correct
03:41 - now
03:43 - what if all
03:46 - right I'm going to save that for the
03:49 - next problem because next problem is
03:50 - going to be a lot more fun and more
03:52 - challenging where you're going to have
03:53 - to solve the biggest guys so if I give
03:56 - you 3 guys what do you do we're going to
03:59 - discuss that in the next problem if you
04:01 - haven't already subscribe I'll see you
04:03 - in the next video
