00:13 - something really exciting happened today

00:33 - guys who want to do some front-end
00:34 - that's a good place to check it out but
00:37 - one thing I wanted to tell you guys is
00:39 - we like we're pretty much almost like
00:42 - business partners so we actually got the
00:45 - office here yeah we got and his mom just
00:55 - came recently and you got this awesome
00:57 - buddy yeah so we got the office and we
01:04 - were like trying to figure out everybody
01:07 - was laughing at us that we made that
01:08 - decision because they're like you guys
01:10 - are crazy
01:11 - tarded yeah we're dumb and we're gonna
01:13 - like lose our money always yeah but one
01:19 - great amazing thing that happened is so
01:21 - like we've been coming to the office and
01:22 - I'm working on my YouTube videos and my
01:24 - channel Tenzin is working on his YouTube
01:27 - videos his channel my channel is
01:29 - non-existent at this point day one yeah
01:31 - 22 subs 24 dude oh yeah yeah and that's
01:36 - exciting I mean that such as how it is
01:38 - in the start but I you guys should
01:40 - definitely go and subscribe to the
01:42 - channel but one thing I wanted to say
01:44 - was one really huge thing happened today
01:47 - where we first of all we already got
01:50 - like some like one of the things was we
01:53 - wanted to generate enough income so our
01:55 - office was affordable because the office
01:59 - money that we were paying was really
02:01 - eating into our finances like I was
02:03 - hurting us but our entire goal was
02:06 - not to like cut coffee we didn't want to
02:10 - like cut our stuff that we did like even
02:13 - right now we're gonna go play outside
02:14 - like some snooker then we're gonna go
02:15 - outside and that's someplace nice and
02:17 - grab some food before we actually part
02:19 - ways but our goal was not to like lower
02:23 - standard of life but what we wanted to
02:25 - do was find a way to earn enough income
02:28 - so the office gets paid off like it's
02:32 - not about your expense it's about your
02:33 - return on investment right so or or your
02:37 - the money that you're getting back
02:38 - ultimately at the end of the day so it
02:40 - wasn't about the expense that we were
02:41 - putting into the office it was like what
02:43 - kind of productivity levels that could
02:45 - give us and what kind of business it
02:46 - could give us and now the whole time we
02:49 - were thinking if there was one client or
02:51 - one way we could do to just get enough
02:53 - money to pay off the office that would
02:55 - be like the ultimate goal and if we can
02:57 - get a client or multiple clients who
02:59 - could help us pay off every month of the
03:01 - office that we have to pay the office
03:03 - has just negated and then we can focus
03:05 - on everything that's important things so
03:07 - now the biggest thing that happened
03:10 - which is on I can't curse believable is
03:16 - that we have gotten multiple clients but
03:20 - just one of those clients is going to be
03:22 - helping us pay what we're basically
03:25 - gonna be running Facebook campaigns for
03:27 - them and doing like targeted ads
03:29 - targeted marketing and that's gonna
03:31 - generate enough income to go over well
03:34 - over for the office each month that's
03:37 - right just one coin and we're done okay
03:40 - so all it takes is one that's right and
03:43 - and and now we just focus on other
03:46 - things we don't have to worry about our
03:48 - office anymore we just focus on other
03:50 - things but that's how it is for lots of
03:51 - the things that we do like we might get
03:53 - a service like leadpages con with just
03:55 - $97 a month or I might get a service
03:58 - like he has a service for teachable I
04:00 - have a service for teachable and we're
04:01 - paying X amount of dollars per month but
04:03 - we're never trying to cut our coffees to
04:06 - make money for it each time we get a new
04:08 - client or like okay that's the one
04:10 - that's gonna be there right he's gonna
04:11 - cover it right like the phone bill
04:13 - like powder per month it's never how do
04:17 - I cut start down on my coffee or my
04:20 - double shot and yeah double no white
04:22 - mocha we just get a client we're like
04:25 - okay that's this client is paying for
04:26 - Netflix this client is paying for
04:28 - whatever and your clients could be big
04:30 - clients or they could be just private
04:32 - lessons and that's you can be flexible
04:35 - with it just as long as you can offer
04:37 - value to somebody else and then figure
04:40 - out what you can charge them but if you
04:43 - bring value to other people it's like
04:45 - we're programmers we're not Facebook
04:47 - campaign runners but like we need
04:49 - business so we will learn new different
04:51 - things and then we will work for people
04:54 - so we can generate enough income to
04:56 - survive and then do the things that we
04:57 - want to do which is for me my business
04:59 - club or program or the channel for him
05:01 - it's you know similar to similar things
05:03 - so focus on increasing your income
05:07 - because there's a limit to how much you
05:08 - can cut but there's no limit to how much
05:10 - you can earn so yeah just wanted to fill
05:16 - you guys in and let you guys know what's
05:18 - going on with our lives
05:20 - and where we are at and now we're gonna
05:23 - go eat and play some snooker kick some

05:34 - sparked an idea in your head don't be

05:47 - like don't be one of those people who
05:49 - just put all their time and energy into
