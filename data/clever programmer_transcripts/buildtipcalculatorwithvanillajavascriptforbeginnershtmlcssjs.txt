00:00 - ladies and gentlemen have you ever been
00:02 - at a restaurant with a bunch of your
00:04 - friends and then the waiter brings a
00:06 - check at the end of your nice juicy meal
00:09 - and then you're just sitting there
00:10 - looking at each other trying to figure
00:12 - out and pulling your hair out how to
00:14 - calculate how much everybody owes and
00:16 - how much the tip is well that's the
00:18 - problem that we're going to be solving
00:20 - today we're going to be building a tip
00:22 - calculator that not only shows you the
00:24 - tip and how much you owe but also
00:26 - calculates the tip and how much
00:28 - everybody owes so once and for all you
00:30 - can solve this problem we're gonna be
00:32 - doing this with javascript vanilla
00:35 - javascript actually that's gonna be our
00:36 - weapon of choice smash that like button
00:38 - so this video goes at as many people as
00:40 - possible and as always here's a picture
00:42 - of a baby panda and let's get into it
00:44 - for those of you who don't know me i am
00:46 - rafae kazi i'm the ceo and founder of
00:49 - clever programmer and i just like to go
00:50 - by kazi now if you want to build this
00:52 - along with me you're going to have to
00:54 - fork this because the styling of this
00:57 - app is already completed we're gonna be
00:59 - working on the javascript functionality
01:01 - so make sure to go below at this link or
01:04 - just click the link in the description
01:05 - below uh it's gonna be a replit link and
01:08 - simply go ahead and hit fork all right
01:10 - once you hit fork on that what that will
01:13 - do is allow you to code in that couple
01:16 - by yourself okay and um what you could
01:18 - do then is just code along and finish
01:21 - the javascript portion so the files that
01:23 - you're going to get are going to already
01:25 - have the html and css completed you're
01:28 - going to only need to write the vanilla
01:31 - javascript to make the entire
01:33 - functionality of this app work all right
01:36 - with that said let's go ahead and i hope
01:39 - you've already forked this because if
01:41 - you're not i don't know how you're gonna
01:42 - build along with me but go ahead and
01:43 - fork it and let's build this app
01:45 - together here's what we're gonna do now
01:46 - we're gonna step it up we're gonna go
01:48 - and start building a tip calculator app
01:52 - so check it out i'm going to go over
01:54 - here and we're going to do the following
01:56 - i'm going to open this up so hit that
01:59 - button right behind my face the top
02:01 - right and it's going to open up this
02:03 - um this right here and we're going to go
02:05 - over to tip calculator and hit click on
02:08 - it okay
02:09 - and here if you type in let's say
02:12 - the bill total is 100
02:14 - the tip amount is 10
02:17 - and you can see it already calculated it
02:19 - correctly right because if the bill is a
02:21 - hundred dollars and the tip is ten
02:22 - percent well that's the tip would be ten
02:24 - dollars so the total would be a hundred
02:27 - and ten dollars per person but what if
02:30 - we had more people what if we had two
02:31 - people so watch what happens when i hit
02:33 - plus
02:34 - boom the bill just got divided between
02:36 - two people and so it automatically tells
02:38 - hey john you need to pay 55 kazi you
02:41 - need to pay 55 so both people know
02:44 - exactly how much they need to pay what
02:46 - if i keep increasing this number well
02:48 - you see it keeps dividing
02:50 - between all of those people so if the
02:52 - bill was 110 and you divide that by 10
02:55 - people you get 11 dollars per person now
02:58 - watch what happens if i keep subtracting
03:00 - it's subtracting and subtracting
03:01 - subtracting it if i go here and now
03:03 - subtract it watch it's not going to let
03:05 - me go down to zero right i'll try a
03:07 - couple i'll try a couple more times boom
03:09 - boom boom boom boom boom boom boom nope
03:11 - does not let me go below one
03:14 - so these are some of the functionalities
03:16 - of this app that you'll have to keep in
03:18 - mind so for example what will you need
03:20 - to know how to do
03:22 - well you'll actually need to be able to
03:24 - get the user input
03:26 - from this field right here
03:28 - okay
03:29 - and this field let's say it's called our
03:31 - this one over here let's just say it's
03:33 - called bill total input
03:36 - okay
03:38 - then you're going to have to get
03:40 - data from this tip as well
03:45 - and let's say this one is called tip
03:47 - input
03:48 - okay
03:50 - um also you're gonna be able to you're
03:52 - gonna need to be able to pull the number
03:54 - of people at any given time
03:57 - this one will probably be called let's
04:00 - say number of people okay so maybe these
04:02 - are all divs or inputs that you can have
04:05 - you know these are ids that you might be
04:07 - able to have access to okay and then
04:09 - this over here this right over here
04:13 - right this will be called
04:16 - per
04:17 - person
04:18 - total okay and all of these will be div
04:21 - ids okay which means these are special
04:24 - things inside of the html and you can
04:26 - get access to all of this so then if you
04:28 - want to get access to
04:30 - this hundred and ten dollars you'll be
04:31 - able to do something like per person
04:34 - total
04:36 - uh you know
04:37 - div dot
04:39 - inner text
04:40 - or whatever right and that'll get you
04:42 - access to what you're looking for
04:44 - and that's just to show you how the
04:46 - javascript portion will interface with
04:49 - this app okay and then based on that
04:51 - you're going to need to do things right
04:53 - so for example you're going to need to
04:55 - do some calculations that
04:58 - you know maybe take the
05:00 - bill
05:02 - plus the tip
05:04 - and then it divides that by the number
05:05 - of people and then when you do that you
05:07 - get this
05:08 - so there's going to be a bunch of things
05:10 - that you're going to need to understand
05:12 - but take a screenshot of this actually
05:14 - right now on your computer or with your
05:16 - phone
05:17 - because this will help you
05:19 - constantly refer to certain key elements
05:22 - on how this app is going to work
05:25 - so i'm going to now explain and kind of
05:27 - walk through this app and we're also
05:29 - going to have you set it up on a new
05:31 - repel so let's go ahead and do that now
05:34 - so
05:35 - this is going to be your tip calculator
05:38 - exercise so how you're going to get
05:39 - access to it so i'm going to zoom in
05:41 - here so you can see everything
05:44 - a lot more clearly
05:47 - okay
05:48 - and then we're going to kind of walk
05:49 - through every single thing so on the
05:51 - left hand side right you see projects
05:54 - make click into projects all right now
05:56 - when you click into projects you're
05:57 - going to see
05:59 - tip calculator so go ahead and click on
06:02 - tip calculator and now you're going to
06:04 - see exercise now don't go into the
06:07 - solution because once again if i show
06:09 - you how this works over here right let's
06:11 - run this
06:13 - and over here you'll see that we have
06:15 - project exercises project solutions so
06:17 - here's the tip calculator solution this
06:20 - will be the fully working app so you'll
06:22 - be able to type in 100 here and 10 and
06:25 - it'll calculate everything correctly
06:27 - you'll be able to hit plus minus minus
06:29 - minus
06:30 - so this right now is the working version
06:33 - okay so if you need to see the solution
06:35 - anytime don't go to it right now
06:38 - do not do it but this is where the
06:40 - solution will be
06:41 - and the main file that you need to write
06:43 - code for is the script.js file the
06:45 - javascript file
06:47 - the index.html and the style files are
06:50 - already completed for you so you don't
06:52 - need to touch them if you make the
06:53 - javascript work this entire app will
06:56 - work okay so that's where your solution
06:58 - is going to be but if you go to tip
07:01 - calculator from project exercises and
07:03 - you do
07:04 - 110
07:06 - and
07:07 - see nothing happens you can't change the
07:08 - number of people it doesn't update your
07:10 - score
07:11 - there's no calculations being done here
07:13 - so the javascript here is not working
07:16 - okay so this is where your javascript is
07:18 - not working
07:21 - so
07:22 - this is your exercise file okay now what
07:25 - i recommend highly highly highly highly
07:28 - recommend you don't just start coding in
07:31 - this script.js what i recommend is you
07:33 - create a new rupple with these three
07:36 - files
07:37 - right and then get started okay so let's
07:40 - go ahead and do that now so i'm going to
07:42 - create a new tab here
07:44 - and we're going to go to replic.com all
07:47 - right now we're going to choose html css
07:50 - and javascript rupple and here i'm
07:52 - basically going to say
07:54 - let's go and say tip calculator exercise
07:59 - and i will hit create rupple
08:02 - okay now that this rebel is created
08:05 - what i recommend you do is go back
08:08 - go to your index
08:10 - copy all of this so command a command c
08:13 - or control a control c okay cop select
08:16 - all right in here
08:18 - copy it
08:19 - go here and
08:21 - delete everything in this index.html and
08:24 - paste
08:25 - what you just copied okay so once you
08:27 - paste it you should see a ugly looking
08:30 - bill
08:31 - app okay
08:32 - now the next thing we're gonna do is
08:34 - we're gonna grab the style file so let's
08:36 - go ahead and grab the style file
08:38 - copy it
08:39 - come back go to your style.css delete
08:42 - everything that's in here hit paste
08:46 - hit run
08:47 - and now the styling is complete so now
08:50 - our app is looking good okay so this is
08:52 - what style files stylesheet is for
08:56 - now the last thing we're actually going
08:58 - to do here
08:59 - is
09:01 - you see if you go to your script
09:03 - there it's empty so we're going to go
09:04 - ahead to our exercise
09:06 - copy the whole thing okay command a
09:08 - command c
09:10 - come over here paste it so now when you
09:13 - look here
09:14 - uh there isn't any real javascript code
09:17 - written up okay
09:18 - and what i'm gonna do is i'm just gonna
09:19 - collapse all of these functions
09:22 - and now what we're going to do is we're
09:24 - actually just going to walk through
09:26 - walk through like all of the um all of
09:30 - the things that you need to know in the
09:31 - gotchas right
09:33 - and then you'll be able to just get
09:35 - started and code it up yourself okay but
09:37 - just let's walk through it together all
09:39 - right so you're gonna be building the
09:41 - tip calculator app now there are a
09:43 - couple of things that you're gonna need
09:45 - to know
09:46 - all right otherwise this prop this
09:48 - project is going to become way harder
09:50 - for you and i don't want that to happen
09:51 - okay so i want it to be something that
09:53 - you're able to kind of grasp
09:55 - so there are a couple of functions
09:57 - you're going to need to know their names
09:58 - all right and you have access to them so
10:00 - you have access to calculate bill
10:03 - increase people decrease people these
10:05 - are the functions you're going to create
10:07 - these are the only three functions
10:08 - you'll need and make sure to give them
10:10 - this exact name they're already made for
10:12 - you you cannot change their names if you
10:14 - change their name your app will break
10:16 - i'll explain why these functions are
10:19 - hard coded inside of our index.html okay
10:22 - so for example
10:24 - when you are typing over here
10:27 - typing over here every time you type on
10:30 - key up
10:31 - we're calling the calculate bill
10:32 - function
10:34 - so that function is running literally
10:36 - every single time you type here
10:38 - that's why that function is there you
10:40 - don't need to change that name the other
10:42 - function i told you about for example
10:45 - increase people and decrease people
10:47 - function those are also written here so
10:50 - for example you can see here increase
10:53 - there's a plus sign
10:55 - right there
10:56 - right and then there is a minus sign
10:58 - right there and then there is a number
11:02 - right over here
11:04 - every single time you click this plus
11:06 - button right over here
11:08 - every time you click this plus button
11:10 - this function increase people will run
11:14 - every time you click this minus button
11:15 - over here this function decrease people
11:18 - will run
11:20 - that's what's happening so that's why
11:21 - these functions have special names do
11:23 - not change them
11:24 - unless you change them here and then
11:26 - you're fine okay but i just don't want
11:28 - you to
11:29 - fall prey
11:31 - the next thing
11:32 - every time you
11:34 - clickety clack and type anything in here
11:36 - or here anything anything you type in
11:38 - here here
11:39 - you're gonna run this calculate bill
11:41 - function
11:43 - okay
11:44 - for your tip
11:46 - and your bill total okay so calculate
11:48 - bill
11:49 - and then you also have calculated bill
11:51 - twice you can see that
11:53 - so this calculate bill is for this one
11:56 - and this calculate bill here is for this
11:58 - one okay so every time you type in any
12:00 - of those fields calculate bill
12:02 - automatically fires and runs
12:04 - going um and then the other things
12:06 - you'll need to know are a couple of
12:08 - things like you know
12:11 - you have
12:12 - this bill input and you have a tip input
12:14 - right so
12:16 - you have ids like build total input
12:19 - and you have other ids
12:22 - like tip input so let's look for temp
12:24 - input you have tip input okay
12:26 - now because i'm nice
12:28 - all right not everybody's gonna be this
12:30 - nice but what i've done for you is i
12:32 - have put it all into the javascript file
12:34 - everything you need to know so you don't
12:36 - have to go to your
12:37 - index.html file pretty much at all okay
12:40 - you don't have to like go and look at
12:41 - anything
12:43 - because what i've done here for you is
12:45 - i've already just told you hey here are
12:46 - the three functions you need to know
12:48 - calculate bill increase people decrease
12:51 - people i'm already letting you know
12:53 - these functions are hard coded in the
12:54 - html so you cannot change their names
12:57 - and then i'm already letting you know
12:59 - these are all the div ids you're going
13:00 - to need access to so you're going to
13:01 - need access to build total input
13:04 - this is going to be this div or this
13:07 - input field
13:09 - so that's going to be that input field
13:11 - you're going to need tip input
13:13 - okay this is going to be the user input
13:15 - for tip
13:16 - you're going to need access to
13:19 - you're gonna need access to
13:22 - so let's just draw these again that's
13:24 - right there
13:25 - tip input is right there you're gonna
13:27 - need access to number of people which is
13:29 - right there this is a div okay so this
13:32 - is a div id so once you get the div
13:34 - you're gonna need to do dot inner text
13:36 - to get to get these okay and then you're
13:39 - gonna need access to so you're gonna
13:42 - either for this i think you might need
13:43 - to do dot value
13:45 - uh one of those dot value or dot inner
13:47 - text okay try both of them and it should
13:49 - work one of them should work and then
13:51 - you have per person total which is right
13:53 - there
13:54 - so those are the div ids you're going to
13:56 - need access to i'm already telling you
13:58 - their exact names so you don't have to
14:00 - look in your html file
14:03 - right over here on line 20 i'm telling
14:05 - you hey get global access to all of
14:08 - these inputs okay meaning just get
14:10 - access to all of these inputs right here
14:12 - before you start creating your functions
14:14 - because your functions are going to need
14:16 - access to them
14:18 - so
14:19 - you know if i were you i'd do something
14:20 - like const
14:22 - let's say bill total input div or
14:25 - something right and then or build total
14:27 - input and
14:29 - you can do something like
14:32 - document.getelementbyid and then pass in
14:34 - bill total input
14:36 - okay this is just an example of how you
14:39 - would get this specific one right over
14:41 - here
14:42 - all right so what i'd recommend is you
14:44 - grab not just this one but all of them
14:47 - so you have all four of these divs and
14:49 - have access to them that's what i would
14:51 - recommend you do here going underneath
14:54 - here i would i recommend that on line 24
14:57 - line 25 get number of people from number
14:59 - of people div
15:01 - so once you get access
15:03 - to these four divs bill input tip input
15:05 - number of people div and per person
15:07 - total div
15:08 - you can use the number of people div and
15:10 - from there you can actually get access
15:12 - to the number of people by pulling the
15:14 - dot text okay
15:16 - and remember to type cast so anytime you
15:18 - get a thing so let's say
15:20 - thing
15:22 - input and then you either do value or
15:24 - dot inner text but both of them are
15:27 - going to return to you a string that's
15:28 - going to look like this
15:30 - and then you call the number function on
15:32 - it and then that will turn it into an
15:34 - actual 10 okay and then you'll be able
15:36 - to do math on that because remember if
15:38 - you take 10
15:40 - string and you add another 10 string to
15:42 - this
15:44 - this is actually going to give you not
15:46 - 20
15:47 - but
15:48 - 10 10 10
15:49 - 10 10 okay which is going to be silly
15:51 - so
15:52 - you want to do you want to do it the
15:54 - right way okay so make sure you type
15:56 - cast it use that number function
15:58 - okay so this is where you're going to
16:00 - set up all your globals and then you're
16:02 - going to be good to go now let's go into
16:05 - each of these functions at a high level
16:07 - so you're gonna create three functions
16:08 - here
16:10 - all right
16:11 - um and you're gonna define these three
16:13 - functions so calculate bill
16:17 - calculate bill will pretty much run
16:20 - all the time like you should calculate
16:22 - bill
16:23 - when a user types it here automatically
16:26 - you should calculate bill when the user
16:28 - updates the tip you should calculate
16:30 - bill when the user hits this plus sign
16:32 - you should calculate the bill when the
16:34 - user hits this minus sign and ultimately
16:37 - what calculate bill is doing is it's
16:39 - updating this number over here the total
16:41 - per person owed
16:43 - okay that's the ultimate job of
16:45 - calculate bill okay you can see it says
16:48 - calculate the total bill per person
16:50 - that's what it does and then if you go
16:52 - here there are ample ample ample amounts
16:55 - of tips for you on how to actually do
16:57 - this okay so i have tons of
16:59 - notes for you
17:00 - as you go and code this along so i hope
17:02 - you don't have too much problems there
17:05 - okay i i'll guide you through everything
17:07 - hey
17:08 - get the user input and convert it into a
17:10 - number so i'm reminding you to type cast
17:12 - here
17:13 - hey get the tip from user and convert it
17:15 - into a percentage hey get the total tip
17:18 - amount calculate the total amount and
17:20 - then update it on the dom and show it to
17:22 - the user right so updated on the dom
17:24 - means update this right here
17:27 - so calculate bill hopefully
17:30 - that kind of makes sense at high level
17:32 - increase people what this will do is
17:34 - splits the bill between more people
17:36 - all right
17:37 - so what should happen here well it walks
17:40 - you through it should increment the
17:42 - amount of people
17:44 - amount of i'll just say amount of people
17:48 - then you update the dom with the new
17:49 - number of people
17:51 - all right so what does that mean
17:52 - so you increment the amount of people
17:55 - and then once you increment it you make
17:58 - sure that you write that to the dom like
18:00 - you change this one to a two for example
18:03 - and this function runs increase people
18:06 - increase people function runs every time
18:08 - you hit this plus button so when you hit
18:10 - this plus button
18:11 - that function runs when you hit the
18:13 - minus button
18:14 - decrease people function runs okay
18:17 - hopefully those are kind of
18:18 - self-explanatory
18:20 - uh but
18:21 - hopefully that makes sense
18:23 - and then at the end you want to
18:24 - calculate the bill based on the number
18:26 - of people so
18:28 - i'm already giving you a hint
18:30 - you're going to be reusing some of the
18:32 - functions you've created previously okay
18:34 - perfect so i'm going to close this
18:36 - go here decrease people it splits the
18:39 - bill between fewer
18:41 - people okay so there i'm gonna go over
18:44 - the similarities between increase and
18:46 - decrease people right if you look at
18:48 - this
18:49 - increment update the dom calculate the
18:52 - bill
18:52 - decrease people decrement
18:55 - amount of people
18:57 - update the dom with the new number of
18:59 - people
19:00 - and then calculate the bill based on the
19:01 - new number of people so they're pretty
19:04 - similar and how they work so once you
19:05 - figure out one of them the next one will
19:08 - be really easy
19:09 - the only difference between decreased
19:11 - people is you
19:13 - when you hit plus you can go as high as
19:15 - you want but when you hit minus you
19:17 - shouldn't be able to go below one
19:18 - because it wouldn't make sense right you
19:20 - have the bill but then how come it has
19:22 - zero people that owe it that doesn't
19:24 - make sense so it shouldn't have zero or
19:26 - you can't have negative people right so
19:29 - you can't decrease the number of people
19:30 - to zero or negative
19:32 - so here i recommend you write a guard
19:34 - clause i haven't shown you what a guard
19:36 - clause is but basically it's just an if
19:38 - here
19:39 - it's a fancy name for just an if
19:41 - statement and if statement is just
19:42 - something along the lines of this okay
19:45 - if something
19:47 - something is not true i'm just gonna
19:49 - write in english just return and what
19:52 - that basically means is this will end
19:54 - the function so if you say return
19:56 - it just won't activate any lines that
19:58 - are below it so let's say you were going
20:00 - to decrement the number decrement the
20:01 - number of people here
20:03 - but here you check for the condition is
20:05 - people equal to one one or less oh hey
20:08 - is people
20:10 - less than or equal to one
20:12 - if people is less than or equal to one
20:15 - then don't run any of these lines of
20:17 - code
20:18 - right like just stop
20:20 - the return here just like hey stop the
20:22 - function end it right here
20:24 - okay and and you're not even giving it
20:26 - anything to return just return stop
20:28 - right here so that's an example of how
20:31 - that would work okay so i'm gonna get
20:33 - rid of all of that now
20:35 - so that would be our decreased people
20:36 - function
20:38 - okay
20:39 - so i hope that this exercise kind of
20:42 - gives you everything you need to know
20:44 - and now you should be able to get
20:46 - started working on this project i wish
20:48 - you the best of luck
20:50 - and
20:51 - give it your best shot try as hard as
20:53 - you possibly can i really believe you're
20:55 - going to make a lot of progress and i
20:57 - think that if you really push yourself
20:59 - you should be able to do this if you
21:01 - don't get this done
21:02 - don't get discouraged it's okay i'm
21:05 - right here right we'll code this
21:07 - together i'll show you the solution
21:09 - next
21:10 - um and yeah we'll just walk through this
21:12 - together okay so pause the video now
21:15 - give this a shot and try to nail this
21:18 - and get this done and then what i
21:19 - recommend is you come back and walk
21:21 - through the solution because our
21:23 - solutions might be different and you
21:25 - might be able to pick up you know a lot
21:27 - of things from how
21:29 - maybe i solved the problem versus maybe
21:31 - how you solve the problem okay and
21:32 - remember in coding there always can be
21:34 - multiple different ways and one way
21:35 - isn't necessarily wrong okay it's kind
21:39 - of an art form so we're gonna have
21:40 - different ways where we get to something
21:42 - so that's it um i hope you enjoyed this
21:44 - and uh get to working and i'll see you
21:46 - soon
21:48 - all right so i hope that you gave it a
21:50 - try and if you got it good job for
21:53 - solving the tip calculator if you didn't
21:55 - it's okay we're gonna do it now let's do
21:58 - it together so let's build the tip
22:00 - calculator so here we're gonna walk
22:03 - through right and let's pay attention to
22:04 - the instructions the first thing is
22:06 - we're gonna get access to all of our
22:09 - inputs and divs okay so our bill input
22:11 - tip input number of people div and per
22:13 - person total diff so let's get access to
22:15 - all of these now
22:16 - so i'm basically going to say cons bill
22:18 - input and we're going to say
22:20 - document.getelementbyid
22:23 - and we're going to say bill input total
22:26 - build total input and then we're going
22:28 - to get access to our tip input so we're
22:30 - going to say
22:31 - document.getelements by id and i'm going
22:34 - to paste in tip input because these are
22:36 - the specific ids i need then let's get
22:38 - access to our number
22:40 - of people div
22:42 - and we're gonna do get element by id
22:46 - and then we're gonna paste that in right
22:48 - there number of people
22:50 - and we're gonna do
22:51 - get access to our per person total
22:54 - okay and this will be
22:56 - per person total so
22:58 - we're going to get access to all of this
23:00 - and what global access means is because
23:02 - we're defining it all the way up here
23:04 - all of our functions will have access to
23:08 - all of these divs
23:10 - all right another thing we're going to
23:11 - need is we're going to need the number
23:13 - of people
23:14 - from number of people div so now i'm
23:16 - going to say let number be why i'm
23:19 - saying let here is because the number of
23:20 - people is going to change so sometimes
23:22 - it's going to be 1 sometimes it's going
23:23 - to be 2 3 4 5
23:25 - right so number of people is going to
23:27 - change so we're going to say
23:29 - let number of people equal
23:31 - we're going to go to our number of
23:32 - people div
23:34 - right and then we'll try and see if we
23:37 - can do inner text and let's type cast it
23:39 - into a number now let's see if any of
23:42 - this works okay so in my calculate bill
23:45 - i'm just going to try to do a console
23:46 - log and i'm just going to say hey show
23:48 - me number of people and let's just see
23:49 - if like any of this is even working
23:51 - right so if i type in here every time i
23:56 - type it runs my calculate build function
23:58 - and every time it runs that it actually
24:01 - shows me
24:02 - my number of people
24:04 - right
24:05 - um my number of people is one so that's
24:07 - why i just keep saying one one one one
24:08 - one okay
24:10 - now i can do console log and we can also
24:13 - do bill input right and i can get the
24:15 - bill input value and we can console log
24:18 - that too so i can go here and say one
24:20 - two three and you can see we got one two
24:23 - three
24:23 - at the bottom
24:25 - right and the console log
24:26 - abc and i got abc at the bottom
24:30 - hopefully you can see that it's right
24:32 - there
24:33 - perfect so
24:35 - it looks like i'm able to uh get
24:38 - information from from these divs and
24:40 - things so that's working so i'm gonna
24:42 - now remove these console logs because i
24:44 - verified what i needed to verify now i'm
24:46 - just going to follow the instructions
24:48 - that i have written here so get bill
24:50 - from user input and convert it into a
24:52 - number
24:53 - so i'm going to basically say hey bill
24:55 - input
24:56 - and
24:57 - what i'm going to say dot value should
24:59 - honestly get me the actual
25:01 - bill now i should just have to type
25:03 - cassette to a number and this should get
25:06 - get me the actual bill and now let's
25:07 - just save it to a variable and we'll
25:09 - call that bill let's console log bill
25:12 - and uh let's see what happens okay so
25:14 - let's run our app and one two three
25:18 - right and our bill is
25:20 - constantly being printed out to the
25:21 - screen and it's a number so that's
25:23 - that's good so i'm gonna remove this
25:24 - console log don't need that anymore now
25:26 - we're to get the tip from user and
25:28 - convert it into a percentage so we're
25:30 - going to say const tip
25:32 - is equal to
25:34 - we're going to do the same thing and
25:35 - we're going to say tip input dot value
25:37 - this time and we're going to actually
25:39 - convert it into a percentage right
25:41 - because that's what it says convert into
25:43 - a percentage divided by 100 so we're
25:45 - going to divide it by 100. now let's
25:47 - console.log the tip percentage
25:50 - let's run this and i'm gonna do 10 and
25:54 - notice it gave me 0.1 because 10 divided
25:57 - by 100 is 0.1 so that's perfect right
26:00 - we're getting our to percentage that
26:02 - means it's 10 great so i can get rid of
26:04 - this console log don't need that anymore
26:06 - all right now we're going to get the
26:07 - total tip amount and how we're going to
26:10 - get this is we're just basically going
26:12 - to say you know it's going to be bill
26:15 - multiplied by tip percentage right so
26:19 - now let's go ahead and console log this
26:21 - and we're going to say tip amount tip
26:23 - amount
26:25 - okay and i'm gonna just put it as an
26:26 - object so it prints out kind of nicely
26:28 - so let's go ahead and let's do
26:30 - writing this is the same as writing this
26:34 - both are the same so this is just like a
26:36 - pro little pro hack all right so i'm
26:37 - going to say 10
26:39 - and tip amount did not get updated
26:42 - interesting so let's go ahead and fix
26:43 - that let's run this again let's say 10
26:46 - oh because i'm not putting in a bill
26:48 - total so let's go ahead and do hundred
26:51 - dollars ten percent on that tip amount
26:53 - is ten uh what if it was two hundred
26:55 - dollars seven mile would be twenty
26:56 - dollars let's do three hundred dollars
26:58 - and you can see that tip amount is
27:00 - calculating correctly right it says 30.
27:03 - uh that's perfect so it looks like this
27:06 - is working so i'm going to go ahead and
27:07 - remove this console log don't need that
27:09 - anymore all right now next up we need to
27:11 - calculate the total so the total is
27:14 - going to be tip amount plus bill so
27:16 - let's go ahead and do const total and
27:18 - we're gonna say tip amount plus bill
27:21 - okay let's go ahead and console log that
27:24 - now and let's run and when i type in 100
27:28 - and i type in so
27:29 - uh 10
27:31 - so right now tip is assuming zero
27:33 - percent so now we have a hundred oh by
27:35 - the way let's do that little trick we'll
27:37 - do this
27:38 - wrap in an object let's try this again
27:41 - and we're going to say 100 and we're
27:43 - going to give a tip of 10 and you can
27:45 - see total is 110. right let's give a tip
27:48 - of 20
27:49 - and total is 120.
27:51 - so this is working exactly like how we
27:53 - wanted to let's get rid of this now
27:56 - now we're going to calculate the per
27:57 - person total where we're going to divide
27:59 - by the number of people
28:01 - so that should be easy to do per person
28:04 - total and we're going to do total
28:06 - divided by and we already have access to
28:09 - number of people right here right this
28:11 - is pulling number of people is pulling
28:14 - straight from here okay so it's one and
28:17 - we're type casting it into a number so
28:19 - it's going to not be a string of one but
28:20 - it's a actual number of one right so
28:23 - we're gonna do that divided by number of
28:24 - people and now let's go ahead and let's
28:28 - show that so we're gonna do per person
28:30 - total let's run this
28:33 - and we have one hundred dollars tip is
28:36 - ten percent and per person total is one
28:39 - hundred and ten it's because right now
28:41 - we're not able to increase the number of
28:44 - people right but let's say i went to my
28:47 - html file and i just hard coded that one
28:50 - to a two let's see what happens i'm
28:52 - going to hard code that to a two let's
28:54 - run our app and let's see if this works
28:55 - so i'm going to say bill is you know
28:58 - bill is 100 and then tip is 10
29:02 - and you can see that it says 55 dollars
29:04 - per person right which which makes ample
29:07 - amount of cents 55 per person why
29:10 - because it's 110 110 divided by two
29:13 - people is 55. so now let's go and change
29:16 - that hard-coded to back to a one let's
29:19 - run our app again
29:20 - and uh because we want to change that
29:22 - dynamically right we don't want to like
29:25 - hard code it in so make sure that this
29:27 - is back to a one when you run your app
29:29 - perfect
29:30 - so what's up next let's go down and
29:33 - let's see what's up next and now update
29:35 - the per person total on dom and show it
29:37 - to user okay cool so let's go do that
29:41 - so i'm gonna grab per person
29:44 - per person total div because i have
29:46 - access to it from up here oh let's just
29:49 - call it per person total diff
29:52 - okay so per person total div we have
29:54 - access to it up there let's p yeah per
29:57 - person total div and we're going to
29:59 - change its inner text to
30:01 - uh per person total right over here okay
30:04 - so i'm going to say per
30:06 - person total
30:07 - oh i'm sorry okay i'm uh yeah i'm just
30:10 - kind of misunderstanding this but like
30:13 - what i mean is
30:15 - this is going to be total per person
30:17 - okay
30:18 - so that's
30:19 - that's this div right here per person
30:22 - total so we are updating it correctly
30:26 - okay
30:27 - so let's just see what happens now let's
30:29 - run this
30:30 - let's go ahead and type in 100
30:33 - let's type in 10
30:35 - and let's see what happens we're getting
30:37 - back 110 so that's good but we want it
30:39 - to be in dollars so let's go ahead and
30:43 - do string template literals
30:45 - and we're gonna
30:47 - wrap it in this and just put
30:49 - another dollar sign so
30:52 - this dollar sign will just make sure
30:54 - this is javascript and then this dollar
30:55 - sign will actually put an actual dollar
30:58 - sign it's also 100
31:00 - and we'll do 10 and when we go here you
31:03 - can see that it says a hundred and ten
31:06 - dollars
31:07 - okay
31:08 - great
31:09 - now what happens if we have a bill
31:12 - that's something like this
31:14 - 148.5 what happens if we have a bill
31:17 - that's like decimals
31:19 - you know
31:20 - or has maybe
31:22 - weird decimals and now you can see
31:25 - that it started showing like
31:28 - lots of decimal places right like so for
31:30 - 135 dollars and 52 cents it says 149.072
31:36 - like how are you going to pay that in
31:37 - cents that doesn't really make sense so
31:39 - what we want to do here is we want to do
31:41 - a dot 2 fixed
31:44 - so we're going to do that now so
31:46 - you can actually
31:48 - do dot to fix
31:50 - two and pass in two right there and it's
31:53 - gonna make sure that it doesn't go
31:55 - beyond two decimals so let's try some
31:58 - number again like that and you'll notice
32:01 - that now it actually just goes to two
32:03 - decimal places now what if the bill is
32:06 - more like three thousand dollars or
32:09 - something like that it gives you 3300
32:12 - but it doesn't you know it'd be nicer if
32:13 - it kind of put a comma in there right so
32:16 - if you want to kind of do that what we
32:18 - can actually do and this is a cool
32:21 - uh trick that i learned that i use a lot
32:23 - actually so that's why i kind of want to
32:25 - show it off here you can do dot locale
32:28 - string and just pass in um
32:31 - en
32:32 - us so it's just gonna format it to us
32:35 - currency like a dollar currency or
32:38 - whatever right and uh now if you try
32:41 - some bill
32:43 - right you notice that it's actually
32:44 - putting that
32:45 - dollar sign and that comma or sorry not
32:48 - the dollar sign but the comma which is
32:50 - nice so like if you get some like i
32:52 - don't know you're never going to have a
32:53 - bill this much when you're eating food
32:55 - right but all the commas are there and
32:57 - if you get up to 25 million the commas
32:59 - are still there so this is good and we
33:01 - just want to make sure that we still do
33:03 - that dot to fix things so let's do two
33:05 - fixed and pass it to two places right so
33:10 - fix it to do decimals first and then
33:11 - turn it into with commas let's try it so
33:14 - let's try some big number
33:16 - and let's do decimal places like crazy
33:19 - and notice that the decimal places here
33:21 - don't change
33:22 - okay so great
33:25 - all right in this case
33:26 - all right lesson learned so it seems
33:28 - like if you try to use dot 2 fixed and
33:30 - locale string it doesn't work so just
33:32 - pick one in this case we're just going
33:34 - to stick to dot to fix for now okay
33:37 - so without making it much more complex
33:40 - and that'll just take care of the
33:42 - decimal places which is perfectly fine
33:44 - actually but yeah our decimal places
33:46 - will be fine
33:47 - and then you can give whatever
33:48 - percentage tip and everything will work
33:50 - out as expected
33:53 - so let's get rid of this console log we
33:55 - don't need this anymore so i just got
33:57 - rid of it
33:59 - perfect so now it seems like our
34:00 - calculate bill is doing
34:03 - exactly what it needs to do write it it
34:05 - calculates the bill in a really
34:07 - intelligent way so now all we got to do
34:09 - is increase and increase let's work on
34:11 - increased people so here it says
34:13 - increment the amount of people well i
34:15 - already have number of people number of
34:17 - people right here in line 29 so what i'm
34:18 - going gonna do is i'm just gonna copy
34:20 - this and paste it here and i'm just
34:22 - gonna do plus equals one so we're just
34:24 - gonna increment the number of people by
34:26 - one and then we're gonna update it on
34:28 - the dom
34:29 - so we're gonna grab number of people
34:32 - div which is going to be
34:35 - this div right here okay and we're just
34:37 - going to pop in the number of people
34:39 - that we now have so we're going to say
34:41 - number of people
34:42 - is equal to
34:44 - number of people dot inner text
34:47 - is equal to number of people okay
34:50 - so now let's run this and let's hit plus
34:54 - and you can see that every time i hit
34:55 - plus it actually increments the number
34:57 - of people and then it shows it and
34:59 - that's why you can see that it's showing
35:01 - it exactly how we want it to right and
35:04 - right now minus doesn't work okay so
35:06 - that's fine we'll do that in a second
35:08 - but watch what happens when i do this
35:11 - the bill doesn't calculate the right way
35:13 - i have 10 people
35:15 - okay so let's run this again
35:17 - let's go a hundred dollars tip is ten
35:21 - percent okay and let's run this and you
35:24 - can see it's saying everybody owes a
35:26 - hundred and ten dollars per person that
35:28 - doesn't make sense because 110 dollars
35:31 - that's eleven hundred dollars so how
35:33 - come the bill started with a hundred and
35:34 - ten dollars and now we owe 100 110
35:38 - or something's wrong so what we need to
35:40 - do
35:41 - is once we do this we need to
35:43 - recalculate the bill based on the new
35:46 - number of people which is super easy all
35:48 - we have to do here is reuse the function
35:51 - we just created so just call this
35:53 - function and that should handle
35:55 - everything so let's go ahead run this
35:58 - i'm going to say we have 100 bill i'm
36:01 - going to say we're tipping let's say 10
36:04 - number of people is two and boom look at
36:06 - that it's 55. why does it work because
36:10 - remember
36:11 - per person total is calculated total
36:13 - divided by number of people so when you
36:15 - update number of people here
36:17 - this number of people updates and that's
36:19 - the number of people
36:20 - calculate bill function has access to so
36:23 - when you run it again it just
36:26 - recalculates this with a new number of
36:28 - people after you change them pretty
36:29 - beautiful right so very very simple
36:32 - let's go ahead and do the same thing so
36:34 - this code is going to be really really
36:36 - really similar for decrease so decrement
36:39 - the amount of people instead of plus one
36:41 - we're gonna do minus one number of
36:43 - people div we're gonna change to update
36:46 - that and then we're gonna recalculate
36:48 - the bill so it's gonna be very similar
36:50 - to increase so watch what happens when i
36:53 - have a hundred dollars i have a 10 tip i
36:56 - can go one way and i can go backwards
36:59 - look at that how nice but here is the
37:01 - problem i can go more than i can go less
37:05 - than one watch i went to negative one
37:07 - what is that
37:08 - i'm going to negative numbers what is
37:10 - happening how can i have so what the
37:13 - restaurant now owes me for eating there
37:16 - like they should you know what i mean
37:18 - like
37:18 - the royalties there to eat
37:20 - you are special you're a royalty so if
37:23 - you went and the restaurant owed you
37:25 - money i would understand okay fair
37:27 - enough because you're here watching this
37:28 - tutorial you're top of the food chain
37:31 - all right while everybody struggles out
37:33 - there you're here grinding it out so
37:35 - then you can
37:36 - level up your career provide for your
37:38 - family provide for your kids you're a
37:39 - champ tap yourself on the back pat
37:41 - yourself on the back do both tap and pat
37:44 - do them both all right so we don't want
37:47 - to go below one person so we're gonna
37:49 - add what i call a guard clause here
37:52 - basically gonna say if
37:55 - number of people is less than or equal
37:57 - to one homie
37:58 - just stop just stop
38:00 - stop
38:02 - don't run
38:03 - this simply here means end the function
38:05 - right here and the decrease people
38:07 - function on line 70 and don't run any of
38:10 - this
38:11 - so
38:12 - let's try this again and i'll explain
38:14 - 110
38:15 - now when i hit minus watch what happens
38:17 - hit minus
38:21 - nothing happens when i hit plus it works
38:23 - when i hit minus it works but when i hit
38:25 - minus now it doesn't work so what is
38:27 - happening when it's one or less than one
38:30 - it just says hey i noticed that this
38:32 - function is running but i want you to
38:35 - only run here and when this condition is
38:37 - true because number of people is one
38:39 - right just one less than or equal to one
38:41 - yes it's true so then the code just
38:43 - stops and doesn't end up running any of
38:45 - this now in the other case scenario
38:47 - where a number of people is let's say
38:49 - two it goes to less than or equal to one
38:51 - and it goes false so then it doesn't run
38:53 - this but it ends up running all of these
38:55 - here okay so that's why it's a guard
38:57 - clause right so we're just guarding the
39:00 - entire code base and we stop it okay to
39:03 - prove to you i'm just going to say
39:05 - so log number of people
39:09 - so
39:11 - i'm going to stop okay so let's go ahead
39:15 - and
39:16 - run this and watch what happens when i
39:18 - hit minus
39:19 - it detects one is one or less than one
39:22 - so i'm gonna stop right when i go here
39:25 - and try to run minus see it doesn't
39:27 - happen it doesn't happen the console.log
39:29 - statement doesn't happen doesn't happen
39:31 - even here doesn't happen even here but
39:32 - when i go one more below boom one is one
39:36 - or less than one so i'm gonna stop one
39:38 - is one or less than one so i'm gonna
39:39 - stop
39:40 - so it's detecting it right every single
39:42 - time every single time okay so we can
39:45 - even like leave a little message for the
39:47 - user and say you know
39:49 - hey you can't
39:51 - go you cannot less than one person
39:55 - right so now like the user can see this
39:57 - message and no okay i can't do that
40:01 - right so
40:02 - plus plus plus minus minus minus
40:04 - hey you cannot have less than one person
40:07 - and if you want to make it more
40:08 - intrusive and more visible to the user
40:10 - you can even do something like an alert
40:12 - so now we go 100
40:15 - 10
40:16 - tip plus plus plus minus minus minus
40:18 - minus
40:19 - says hey right
40:21 - you cannot have less than one person so
40:24 - it lets us know
40:25 - right there that that's not a
40:27 - possibility so you can do it whatever
40:29 - way you want okay you could throw an
40:31 - error if you want and like that'll kind
40:33 - of crash the app and if you want to be
40:35 - really pro i can give you one like kind
40:37 - of pro javascript tip
40:39 - is uh what you can do is you can throw
40:42 - an error and show the user they're doing
40:44 - something wrong but like kind of in a
40:45 - sneaky way so here you can say you can
40:48 - you can replace this
40:50 - alert with something called a throw and
40:52 - they'll throw an error so you do throw
40:55 - and then what's nice about throw is you
40:56 - won't even need that return like or just
40:58 - leave the return here but like you won't
41:00 - really need it okay so you can do that
41:01 - return pattern i'm leaving this return
41:04 - here to show you use a return pattern
41:05 - again and again because that's normally
41:07 - what i do but here if you want to throw
41:09 - an error and really let the user know
41:10 - you could do that right so for example
41:12 - boom hundred ten percent
41:15 - i try to hit minus and it throws like a
41:17 - red little error at the bottom says hey
41:19 - you cannot have less than one person so
41:21 - it's very clear that the user is trying
41:23 - to do something that they're not allowed
41:25 - to do and like you can make it visible
41:28 - all right so there you go let's see if
41:31 - this entire thing is working or not
41:33 - let's open it up here and let's check
41:35 - right
41:36 - we just built this and we're excited
41:38 - right
41:39 - let's see if it works so we got a bill
41:42 - we just went and ate at a nice
41:44 - restaurant let's say you went to
41:46 - cheesecake factory you took your family
41:48 - out i mean it's a nice night out right
41:51 - they gave you a big fat bill for 375
41:53 - dollars maybe you maybe you brought some
41:55 - friends with you and they're like hey
41:57 - mandatory tip is 20 so you all start
41:59 - freaking out who's going to calculate it
42:01 - what is it going to be what's happening
42:02 - right so you go okay
42:04 - we got the tip is you know 10 or we're
42:08 - going to give a 20 tip so that's
42:10 - oh that's 450 right now but you only
42:14 - have one you only have selected as one
42:15 - person but luckily you brought your
42:18 - friends with you right you brought the
42:20 - entire gang hopefully
42:22 - so you know you got
42:24 - you got uh
42:26 - juanes you got daniel you got frankie
42:29 - you got lance you got nas
42:32 - i mean you got the whole gang up in
42:34 - there right so you got all these six
42:36 - people
42:37 - look at that
42:39 - your bill is only 75 dollars
42:42 - that's not too bad right that's not too
42:44 - bad that's that's easy maybe maybe you
42:47 - bring in two other people from somewhere
42:49 - you go to them and you grab them and
42:51 - you're like hey
42:52 - come join our party and split the bill
42:54 - with them too now the more the merrier
42:56 - am i right you got 56 dollars and 25
43:00 - cents i mean this is
43:02 - at this point the restaurant should be
43:03 - paying you
43:04 - right this is nothing
43:05 - cheesecake factory nice night out with
43:07 - the family and friends i mean come on
43:10 - that's a bargain the 20 tip right
43:14 - so
43:15 - this is this is really nice right this
43:17 - is really nice app that we could
43:19 - actually use and what's amazing is it's
43:21 - already hosted online thanks to repple
43:23 - yeah it's deployed on the interwebs so
43:27 - you could put it on your portfolio you
43:28 - could do whatever you want with its live

43:32 - okay ignore that sound that was i'm
43:35 - having a focus session and it makes this
43:37 - a little big so now what i want you to
43:39 - do is you're gonna grab all of this

43:55 - and then
43:56 - delete everything that's in this
43:57 - exercise file okay and then paste your
44:00 - code in here
44:01 - all right and give it a try and see if
44:04 - it works so go and run it so go to your
44:07 - now project exercises you should be able
44:08 - to go to tip calculator
44:11 - you should be able to
44:13 - type in things like
44:15 - 100 10
