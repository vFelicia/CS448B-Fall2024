19:21 - this is going to say let's build
19:24 - the man tinder
19:28 - clone guys save it
19:31 - and you should see everything centered
19:34 - right
19:34 - now everything being centered isn't it's
19:37 - not actually what we want
19:39 - we don't really want everything to be
19:40 - completely centered thank you
19:42 - saket suman for that donation appreciate
19:45 - you dude
19:45 - all right um thank you g says i wish we
19:48 - could pay pwj monthly
19:50 - guys honestly pay once right now and you
19:52 - will
19:53 - like i'm telling you you'll make that
19:54 - money back it's it's it's ridiculously
19:57 - underpriced i'm and this is my own
19:59 - opinion coming right out now like that
20:01 - cost is so jam-packed with value
20:03 - it is insane like you're going to
20:07 - if you consider it like an investment in
20:09 - yourself
20:10 - think of it that way and there are an
20:12 - amount of people that have landed
20:14 - six figure contracts i mean i the fact i
20:17 - even have to say that and people are
20:18 - getting confused like
20:20 - dude it's just insane like this is this
20:22 - this course is underpriced and you can
20:24 - make sure like grab that deal before it
20:26 - goes okay
20:27 - exactly guys like like i i even see
20:30 - people people get getting paid after two
20:34 - weeks
20:35 - so yeah you will start earning back
20:38 - pretty soon
20:38 - exactly exactly so now guys inside of
20:42 - the class
20:43 - what we're going to go ahead and do is
20:44 - we're going to change this to a
20:45 - lowercase a because we
20:47 - we are pretty much following something
20:49 - called the uh
20:50 - bem class convent like naming convention
20:54 - so this is a really handy way of styling
20:56 - stuff up
20:57 - that will actually go ahead and means
20:59 - that a lot of the stars
21:00 - won't get applied so we're gonna go to
21:01 - app.css do command a
21:03 - and hit delete on everything so it's all
21:05 - gone then we're gonna go into index.css
21:08 - go over here and we're gonna go ahead
21:11 - and say
21:13 - target everything and do a margin
21:16 - of zero and this will go ahead and
21:18 - remove that top gap so you see if i undo
21:20 - that
21:21 - we get that little top gap over here so
21:24 - there we go we get this right here okay
21:27 - now
21:27 - uh imar dahan says it is more than worth
21:30 - it
21:31 - and future code says the more it costs
21:34 - the more you'll be invested in it do the
21:37 - course exactly i could not agree
21:40 - more with elizabeth right there like she
21:42 - is exactly on the ball with that one
21:45 - um guys like you heard her and it's true
21:48 - like if you go ahead and
21:49 - invest in yourself like we all can go
21:52 - out to buy a fancy dinner we can all go
21:54 - out to buy like a movie ticket but
21:56 - when the hell is it you're actually
21:58 - gonna wake up and invest in yourself
22:00 - guys like
22:01 - just it really like it's like guys
22:03 - there's a passion for this stuff and
22:05 - like
22:05 - we're putting a heart and soul into this
22:07 - and we're doing this for you guys so
22:10 - now we have the man tender comb
22:13 - right here guys so now what we're gonna
22:15 - do is go back to our code app.js
22:17 - and we're gonna mask everything out so
22:20 - the app consists of a few different
22:22 - things
22:22 - at the top we have a header okay so
22:26 - let's go ahead we have this header right
22:28 - here
22:29 - and and then in the middle of it we have
22:34 - a we have the tinder cards
22:37 - as over here we have the tinder cards
22:41 - and then we have this stuff over here
22:44 - so this stuff over here is the swipe
22:45 - buttons right
22:47 - so let's go ahead and mask out so over
22:49 - here we have the header
22:51 - so i always like to mask this stuff out
22:53 - david do you find it helps when we mask
22:54 - things up
22:56 - yeah yeah definitely i mean when you
22:58 - plan your application
23:00 - or whatever you're trying to build uh at
23:02 - the very beginning
23:03 - it's gonna give you a quick overview and
23:07 - you can you can code a lot faster
23:09 - because you know
23:10 - what are you going to build right
23:13 - exactly dude and like
23:14 - especially if you ever get stuck it's
23:17 - going to really allow you to come back
23:19 - and sort of realign with yourself and
23:21 - sort of carry on
23:22 - and get it done right exactly so that's
23:25 - what we've done here we've masked it out
23:26 - and everything looks pretty good at this
23:28 - point
23:29 - now what we're going to do is uh
23:31 - priyanshi says it does sunny thank you
23:33 - so much dude
23:34 - yeah glad it helps you so let's go ahead
23:36 - and build the header component so this
23:38 - lovely top bit right here
23:39 - so jumping back into the code we've got
23:42 - header.js
23:45 - and then we're going to use our lovely
23:46 - little snippets trick so rfce
23:49 - boom and then here
23:52 - we're going to save a lifesaver yeah
23:54 - exactly dude class name of header
23:56 - and just to show you guys that little
23:58 - snippet thing is if you go into
23:59 - extensions and type in es7
24:02 - it should be the first one that pops up
24:03 - it's this thing right here
24:05 - so es7 react redux graphql react name
24:07 - snippets i mean this thing's
24:09 - packed with snippets but like the ones
24:10 - that we use are rfce
24:12 - and it is insane like it really does
24:15 - help you speed up your development
24:17 - um oops i'll open that okay
24:21 - let's go ahead and go back so now what
24:22 - we do is every time we create
24:24 - uh joshua thomas says sunny i'm still
24:26 - pumped that's what i'm talking about
24:28 - dude that's the energy we need in this
24:29 - in this team that's that nice all right

27:56 - functional components are new they're
27:58 - more efficient

28:01 - these icons
28:03 - we're going to use material ui to go
28:04 - ahead and install it you need to go down
28:06 - here

28:28 - npm install material ui call okay now
28:31 - why that's happening
28:32 - we're gonna go ahead and um
28:36 - let's go ahead and do uh future code
28:38 - says companies hire people who do
28:40 - who using functional components aim into
28:42 - that elizabeth like i agree with you
28:45 - like uh i went i once joined the company
28:47 - and i couldn't believe you wanna
28:48 - by the way guys just carry on uh you
28:50 - wanna click on icons at the top and
28:52 - search that go
28:53 - here i joined the company and the senior
28:55 - developers
28:57 - didn't know what functional components
28:58 - were i was like what the hell is going
29:00 - on
29:00 - i was like this is not right something
29:03 - is wrong here like you know like
29:04 - it's not like we should we need to like
29:06 - we need to push cutting edge stuff and
29:08 - that's what we're here for guys
29:10 - next step is you want to go ahead and
29:11 - install material ui
29:13 - icons so here we're going to go ahead
29:16 - and do npm install material ui icons you
29:18 - need to do both
29:19 - the core and the icons while that's
29:21 - loading i want you guys to go over to
29:23 - this link over here
29:24 - so where it says you can search the full
29:26 - list of these icons
29:28 - and i've clicked that and this is how we
29:31 - find
29:32 - all of i love it when people do this by
29:34 - the way um oops not that one sorry
29:35 - uh this one where it says like they
29:38 - actually dropped the code snippet and
29:39 - that cool david
29:41 - yeah yeah yeah yeah thanks andrew thanks
29:43 - angie yes that's dope dude
29:45 - right yeah so now somehow some community
29:48 - here exactly
29:50 - so guys once you're here you want to
29:52 - make sure you want to make sure that
29:53 - here you could like if you need like
29:55 - let's go ahead and say we want this icon
29:58 - so this person or profile
29:59 - so i can actually go ahead and type in
30:01 - profile and you can see look i've got
30:03 - loads to choose from i click it and it
30:05 - gives me the importing code
30:07 - and then we pretty much just use that as
30:08 - a component so that's all we need to go
30:11 - ahead and do
30:11 - at this point you can see at the bottom
30:13 - of our terminal it says
30:15 - completed so we can carry on
30:18 - with the build so now
30:21 - we can go ahead and um
30:25 - yeah i'm just reading the comments some
30:28 - people are funny
30:29 - all right so now we can go ahead and at
30:31 - 600 people in this
30:33 - uh live stream now thank you so much
30:34 - guys i appreciate you all
30:37 - um yeah so let's go ahead and now
30:40 - we have the header guys we're gonna go
30:41 - ahead and first we're gonna introduce
30:44 - a um
30:47 - so we're gonna introduce a person icon
30:49 - so let's go ahead and import it at the
30:50 - top so personal icon
30:52 - like so plus an icon there we go
30:55 - save it and we need to use it so let's
30:58 - go ahead and pop it in and this is how
30:59 - you use it guys it says person icon
31:01 - and you want to go ahead and do that and
31:03 - then you can see it jumps in there it's
31:05 - very small
31:05 - but it's go ahead it actually loaded in
31:08 - there that's the icon that we got from
31:09 - material ui
31:11 - so super simple yep exactly shylish says
31:15 - how's your huff now sunny
31:16 - getting better dude thank you for asking
31:19 - um the co
31:19 - the cough is still here but we'll we'll
31:22 - get through it
31:23 - now um i'm going to go ahead and replace
31:25 - this line of code with the following so
31:26 - we're going to use a prop which is font
31:28 - size of large
31:29 - and we're going to give it a class name
31:30 - of header icon um and you can see now it
31:33 - should grow
31:34 - a little bit this gets a little bit
31:35 - bigger and that helps us with the
31:37 - styling of this
31:38 - and also guys you notice that the one
31:40 - over here is actually a button
31:42 - it's clickable it has this nice ripple
31:43 - effect right so to get this
31:46 - ripple effect what we need to do is we
31:47 - can actually use something called
31:49 - the icon button right now i combine we
31:52 - import it like this
31:54 - and we go ahead and we just wrap our
31:57 - button in it so we go ahead and do this
31:59 - oops and we basically go down here we
32:02 - cut
32:03 - paste boom and now this
32:06 - right here turns into a clickable icon
32:09 - so just like that we've we've upgraded
32:12 - this
32:13 - to be so that's so clean that's dope
32:15 - right
32:16 - super powerful super power super simple
32:20 - like that's what's nice but it's really
32:21 - clean and simple um
32:23 - so that's really nice now guys what
32:25 - we're gonna do is we're gonna have the
32:27 - image so the image i'm going to go ahead
32:29 - and pop in next
32:30 - and i'm going to pop the image here and
32:32 - this has got a class name of header logo
32:33 - here's the source this is just a
32:35 - picture of tinder all right now um
32:38 - oat we can leave blank so let's go ahead
32:40 - and save it uh
32:42 - oh the greatest ever says just sent the
32:44 - client an email i hope all goes well
32:46 - good luck dude
32:49 - um oops what have i done here let me go
32:51 - ahead and fix that there we go
32:52 - sorry guys there you go okay
32:56 - so now you can see we have the tinder
32:59 - logo but it's huge right uh david

33:24 - conversation on instagram right
33:26 - so go ahead and check it out that's it
33:30 - dude
33:30 - it's literally the easiest way is just
33:32 - to point down and learn it
33:34 - i just now i'm pointing at the mic and
33:35 - it's literally there so
33:37 - you get used to it yeah it's super hard
33:42 - nice right so now what we're going to do
33:44 - is for the header logo i'm just going to
33:46 - quickly
33:47 - style this one because we without like
33:49 - we can't even see anything with all this
33:51 - on the screen so
33:52 - we're gonna go into header.css and i'm
33:55 - gonna go ahead and say
33:58 - header underscore underscore logo like
34:00 - this
34:01 - and then i'm gonna go ahead and say
34:03 - object fit contain
34:04 - this will keep the aspect ratio and then
34:07 - i'm going to say
34:07 - height of 40 pixels save it
34:11 - boom there we go now it's nice and small
34:15 - really simple really easy right now at
34:17 - the top of the screen
34:19 - we want to lay things out a little
34:20 - differently so i'm going to go back in
34:21 - i'm going to get rid of that i am a
34:22 - header
34:23 - because we know it's a header now and
34:26 - what we're going to do
34:27 - is we're going to go into
34:30 - the header container so this is the main
34:32 - div we're going to say display
34:34 - flex right now flex is cool it allows us
34:38 - to do many things
34:39 - firstly i'm going to align item center
34:41 - now that will actually go ahead and
34:42 - center everything so you see now the
34:44 - tinder icon is now centered with the
34:46 - rest of the page
34:48 - i'm going to also make this a bit bigger
34:49 - there we go
34:51 - nice and then what we're going to do is
34:54 - um
34:54 - heartbreaking says hey sonny sometimes
34:56 - teachers react redux as well you've got
34:57 - a dude we've got the context api in many
34:59 - videos but i will be happy
35:01 - to drop a video on redux and we can
35:03 - maybe use some redux that's cool
35:05 - all right all right so i'm gonna head
35:06 - ahead and say justify content
35:09 - space between and now
35:13 - you can see whoa okay that just flew off
35:15 - somewhere else
35:16 - where the hell did that go oh cause i'm
35:17 - zoomed out yeah i'm zoomed out i'm
35:19 - zoomed in there we go
35:21 - um so now if you see a space between so
35:23 - what it's done is they found the two
35:25 - children and just spaced them apart
35:27 - right so if i had a third in
35:29 - we should see an equal spacing like this
35:32 - right
35:33 - so what we can do now is actually go
35:36 - ahead and i'm actually going to go ahead
35:37 - and say
35:37 - this should have a z index of 100
35:39 - because i want this to like always be at
35:41 - the top
35:41 - in case we have a long page i'm also
35:43 - going to give this a border bottom
35:45 - and this border box will be very subtle
35:47 - it's going to be a light gray
35:50 - right now somebody says hi sunny uh uh
35:53 - how are you i just registered myself in
35:55 - pwg i can't see the name of that person
35:57 - by the way sorry about
35:58 - that but it says uh i received a receipt
36:00 - um what do i do next you should receive
36:01 - a email

38:21 - guys if you get this product for less
38:24 - than a thousand pounds
38:25 - anywhere just grab the dashboard already
38:28 - yeah because like after 12 days it
38:31 - closes
38:32 - and when it reopens that thing is gonna
38:33 - be more than a thousand pounds so
38:36 - i'm not joking when i say that like uh i
38:38 - personally am doing that with kazi and
38:40 - we're gonna up that price so
38:41 - because that program is is just insane

49:02 - uh okay dude so you have as much time as
49:05 - you need to do that course right
49:06 - now obviously it's going to depend on
49:08 - how much work you put in nobody is ever
49:10 - going to give you a shortcut to making
49:14 - like 100k a year but we show you the way
49:17 - to do it

49:24 - right and we're going to take you and
49:25 - literally carry you to the end line
49:26 - right
49:27 - so one thing i will say is there is no
49:29 - duration of the program it's literally
49:31 - down to how much hard work you're paying
49:32 - but there is a duration to that price
49:34 - that is available right now and that
49:35 - ends on sunday and

55:30 - right now
55:31 - so for the tinder cards we're going to
55:33 - go ahead and
55:36 - do the following so we need some state
55:39 - we need some state and right now the
55:41 - state is going to keep track of who
55:42 - these people are so we've got jeff
55:44 - we've got ellen we've got sandra right
55:46 - all these people right now
55:48 - let's go ahead and store them in the
55:50 - state right so we're going to go ahead
55:52 - and say const
55:53 - and here i'm going to say const i'm
55:55 - going to say people
55:57 - and then i'm going to say set people
56:01 - equals use state oops you stay and i
56:04 - need to import this
56:06 - so this needs to be imported from react
56:08 - so at the top here i'm going to go ahead
56:10 - and say
56:11 - use state so i'm going to go ahead and
56:14 - initialize this with an empty array so
56:16 - this is how you write a variable in
56:17 - javascript
56:19 - in uh react sorry in react react right
56:22 - now what we can do is uh we're going to
56:25 - inside of tinder cards we're just going
56:26 - to pretty much and actually you know
56:27 - let's not initialize this with the empty
56:29 - value we're going to say
56:30 - each of these cards is going to have a
56:31 - name so let's go ahead and say the first
56:33 - one we'll name this case let's say elon
56:35 - musk right
56:38 - and then he's going to have a url and
56:40 - that url is going to be for his image so
56:44 - like his profile picture right so
56:45 - somebody said can you share this
56:46 - slack link here you need to be a part of
56:48 - the profit with javascript
56:51 - andrew says have my volume 100 and can
56:53 - barely hear anything
56:54 - i will go ahead and turn the background
56:56 - music a little bit down
56:58 - hopefully that's a bit effort you did so
57:01 - a few people say that i can hear really
57:02 - good um but i turned it down a little
57:05 - bit if you did
57:05 - so here we're going to go ahead and
57:08 - we've got the url so i'm going to grab
57:09 - this is just elon musk's picture of elon
57:11 - musk
57:12 - and then inside of our app what i can do
57:15 - then
57:15 - is i can say with jsx with squiggly
57:19 - brackets i can say people.map
57:21 - i can say for every single person i want
57:23 - to render out the following
57:25 - and here if i do h1 and i was to say
57:27 - person
57:29 - dot name now guys you should be able to
57:32 - see
57:33 - we need to render out the cards so let's
57:34 - go ahead and actually render them out
57:36 - i'm going to say tinder cards
57:39 - auto import boom import at the top
57:42 - save it now we can see elon musk right
57:46 - so you can see um which is awesome
57:49 - so let's go ahead and actually drop
57:51 - another name here so
57:53 - let's go ahead and drop someone else
57:54 - let's say jeff bezos
57:56 - jeff bezos and
57:59 - for jeff this picture will do
58:03 - so jeffy you must type his name exactly
58:06 - jeff reached out to us earlier he said
58:07 - you know
58:08 - make sure you don't put an ugly picture
58:09 - of me so we found a picture
58:13 - and then there you see we've got elon
58:15 - musk and jeff bezos right
58:18 - now for this uh oh somebody said that's
58:21 - probably wrong
58:23 - yeah there we go yeah my bad sorry jeff
58:27 - [Laughter]
58:29 - now what we're gonna do guys for the
58:30 - tinder card right
58:32 - so here we've got the tinder card attend
58:35 - the cards container but what i'm going
58:36 - to actually
58:37 - create another container inside and this
58:38 - one's going to have it's going to say
58:40 - tinder cards um
58:41 - it's going to be tinder cards
58:44 - oops i'm just going to underscore card
58:48 - container this is going to contain all
58:50 - the cards
58:51 - so i'm actually going to go here grab
58:54 - this stuff
58:55 - actually you know for now i'm going to
58:56 - leave it i'm going to say i'll grab it
58:58 - all
59:00 - let's go ahead and chuck it here save
59:02 - boom there we go
59:03 - and now inside of here rather than
59:04 - saying h1 what i'm going to do is i'm
59:06 - actually going to say
59:08 - render a tinder card oops
59:11 - render a tinder card right
59:14 - now this is what we installed earlier so
59:16 - this is a card
59:18 - um and we need to import this from react
59:21 - tinder card so let's go to the top
59:23 - and we're going to say import tinder
59:25 - card from react in the card we installed
59:27 - that not long ago
59:29 - uh and then what we're going to go ahead
59:32 - and do
59:32 - is we're going to go ahead and say
59:36 - um we're going to give this a few things
59:38 - so here's a couple of other properties
59:40 - we're going to give it
59:41 - so i'm going to say tinder card and i'm
59:44 - going to say
59:46 - class name is swipe right we can ignore
59:49 - that for now so we're going to use that
59:50 - later on
59:51 - the key is character name so it's not a
59:53 - great key but it's going to do for now
59:54 - prevent swipe we don't want to swipe up
59:56 - and down so in this case you see i can't
59:58 - i can't actually swipe up in there it
60:00 - doesn't actually let me but if i go left
60:01 - it lets me
60:03 - uh on swipe we're gonna pretty much fire
60:05 - off a function called
60:06 - swiped and on card left screen we have a
60:09 - function called out of frame
60:11 - so this is gonna help you guys out um
60:14 - somebody says i hope i can get a job in
60:16 - 12 days
60:16 - so that i can pay for pwj even if i
60:18 - can't get now once i get a job i'm
60:20 - definitely going to take the course
60:21 - dude my advice for you is either a
60:24 - borrow the money from a friend
60:25 - because that's going to help you out or
60:27 - b use the paypal option when you're
60:29 - paying
60:30 - paypal actually allow you to pay with
60:32 - six months of
60:33 - installments if you use paypal credit
60:37 - stressed oh uh it caught a little bit
60:40 - zero percent interest exactly david yeah
60:42 - whoops yeah yeah so that will actually
60:44 - help you out a lot
60:45 - so now what we're going to do is we're
60:47 - going to go back to our tinder cards
60:49 - and here we're going to fix it so we've
60:51 - got a few euros here
60:53 - this is character.name this should be
60:55 - person
60:56 - it's gonna say person like so and then
60:58 - swiped in our frame of functions
61:00 - that we need to go ahead and create so
61:02 - here i'm gonna say
61:03 - um i'm gonna create two functions one
61:05 - called con swiped and one
61:07 - is out of frame so you can see i've just
61:09 - popped them in here
61:10 - one just says somebody left the screen
61:12 - one says removing the name to delete
61:14 - this takes two arguments direction name
61:16 - delete and then
61:17 - set last direction right so here we
61:20 - don't actually need this
61:22 - to be honest we don't actually need this
61:24 - at this point but this is just gonna
61:25 - help us
61:26 - later on with understanding what's going
61:28 - on so right now we're gonna have console
61:30 - log
61:31 - removing and then this one's gonna say
61:33 - somebody left screen and what we see
61:34 - here
61:35 - i can show you guys if we open the
61:36 - inspector and make this full screen
61:39 - as i swipe it says removing elon musk
61:42 - elon musk left the screen
61:43 - removing jeff jeff left the screen
61:47 - it's kind of fun it's nice it's kind of
61:50 - cool right
61:51 - so that works pretty cool now
61:55 - um so just karen sandy says is the
61:58 - course for absolute beginners
62:00 - 100 percent hey same time dude
62:04 - yeah 100. 100 yeah you can pretty much
62:07 - do that
62:08 - um so nikhil says how do we do the
62:12 - paperwork
62:13 - paypal one actually anyone has any clue
62:14 - if you go ahead and hit the pay with
62:16 - paypal option
62:17 - and then when paypal pops up if it's
62:20 - available it will say paypal credit
62:22 - and you i've used paypal credit myself
62:24 - it's really really cool
62:25 - zero percent interest so if you want to
62:27 - split a payment you can go ahead and use
62:29 - paypal credit
62:31 - um so tinder card um
62:34 - inside of the tinder card here we're
62:36 - going to go ahead and add the following
62:38 - so i'm going to add a div all right and
62:40 - then
62:41 - the div is going to have a background
62:43 - image and i'm going to explain this code
62:45 - right here
62:46 - so we're going to change from this to
62:47 - person but what we're doing here
62:49 - essentially we have a div
62:50 - we have a h3 which says person name
62:53 - inside of it
62:53 - and the div is just going to have a
62:55 - class name of a card and the style here
62:57 - has a background image and it's you hear
62:59 - what we're doing is we're actually
63:00 - rendering a piece of text
63:02 - we're just saying that the url is the
63:05 - following and here i could actually use
63:06 - string interpolation instead
63:08 - so i could go ahead and do this this
63:11 - would be a lot cleaner
63:13 - is this the um inline
63:16 - styling yeah this is am i right yep
63:20 - nice exactly this is inline styling and
63:23 - it's going to help you guys out a lot
63:25 - for this for this use case right now
63:29 - i'm a boss says they teach a lot for a
63:31 - low amount of money i can't agree more
63:33 - dude like i think
63:34 - the price is way undervalued right now
63:36 - which is why i personally
63:37 - will be throwing that price up on sunday
63:40 - so
63:41 - make sure and i'll make sure that yeah
63:43 - and exactly make sure you
63:45 - uh go ahead and check it out but nikhil
63:47 - says don't have
63:48 - if you don't have paper credit honestly
63:50 - just use this maybe the three month
63:51 - payment plan but
63:52 - again guys just like do it your own at
63:55 - your own decision like
63:57 - not here to force anyone to join but if
64:00 - you want to grab that offer it's 12 days
64:02 - so what we're going to do now is tinder
64:04 - cards we're going to go ahead and style
64:06 - this
64:06 - right so let's go ahead and do
64:08 - tindercards.css
64:10 - and this is where the sort of styling
64:11 - magic happens so
64:13 - tinder card
64:16 - tinder cards here so firstly
64:20 - for the card itself so i'm going to say
64:22 - target the card
64:24 - and then we're going to say position
64:25 - relative background color of white
64:27 - so i'm going to go ahead and pop that in
64:28 - first and you see nothing really changes
64:31 - yet
64:31 - okay then we're going to say a width of
64:33 - 600 pixels padding of 20 pixels max
64:36 - width 85
64:37 - view it right so let's go ahead and pop
64:40 - that in
64:40 - okay we've got something showing now
64:44 - and then i'm going to do a height of 50
64:46 - view height which means 50
64:47 - of the screen real estate okay it's
64:50 - pretty cool
64:51 - but this is not elon musk
64:54 - this is definitely uh i need to go ahead
64:57 - and grab elon musk there we go
64:59 - that's sandra bullock smash the like
65:03 - button if you like chandra bullock
65:04 - there you go nice you got it uh
65:08 - dead elon there we go oh yeah nice
65:12 - um so now
65:15 - what we're gonna do
65:20 - right so we have the height of 50 pixels
65:22 - yep and then what we're gonna say is add
65:24 - a box shadow
65:25 - so this box shadow you can pretty much
65:27 - go ahead and copy it's just gonna add a
65:29 - nice little subtle
65:30 - box shadow behind and then we're gonna
65:32 - say border radius
65:34 - 20 pixels background size cover
65:36 - background position
65:37 - center this should send to those images
65:41 - so that they're inside full frame there
65:43 - we go that's really nice
65:45 - really clean now what we're going to say
65:47 - is the card container
65:49 - right we're going to target the card
65:50 - container tinder tinder cards card
65:52 - container we'll say display flex
65:54 - justify the content in the center and
65:55 - the margin top from the top should be
65:58 - 10 view height save it and there we go
66:01 - all right so now it's somewhat looking
66:04 - okay
66:05 - right somewhat okay then we're going to
66:07 - target the swipe element which is
66:08 - actually the tinder cards
66:10 - and we're going to say position absolute
66:12 - now
66:13 - that's where some magic actually came in
66:15 - you see that
66:16 - right it's because they're absolutely
66:18 - positioned and they're basically on top
66:20 - of each other now
66:21 - right so this one's actually on top and
66:24 - then what we're going to say is card
66:25 - content
66:26 - has a width and height of 100
66:29 - save that okay then we're going to go
66:31 - ahead and say card
66:32 - the h3 inside of the card has a position
66:36 - of absolute bottom 0
66:37 - margin 10 pixels and a color of white
66:40 - and this means
66:41 - jeff bezos now pops up on the bottom
66:43 - over there elon musk is now over there
66:45 - that's really
66:46 - clean and then for info text
66:49 - i don't think we actually use the info
66:51 - text do we um no we don't have any
66:53 - vertex there we go
66:55 - nice um what we're going to do at the
66:57 - end is
66:58 - yeah that's it we have the swipeable
67:00 - cards dude
67:02 - smooth awesome awesome so now what we
67:05 - can do is super clean
67:06 - um yeah um so hajjot singh says
67:10 - once we paid then the classes are free
67:12 - for a lifetime or for some period
67:14 - so i think we actually lost david oh
67:17 - damn it
67:18 - maybe there's a connection issue he'll
67:20 - rejoin in just a sec
67:21 - but guys um yeah to answer your question
67:23 - harjo once
67:25 - you pay for a class once you're actually
67:27 - inside a pwj
67:28 - the whole thing is actually
67:31 - completely included for life so it's
67:35 - going to be
67:35 - there for life everything is going to be
67:37 - completely there for you to access and
67:39 - take your time with
67:40 - even the coaching calls are recorded and
67:43 - then we upload them afterwards so that
67:44 - you can actually go ahead and see
67:46 - them whenever you want so if anything
67:49 - the course is constantly getting added
67:50 - to you as opposed to actually taking
67:51 - anything away from you
67:53 - so it's going to be full of value right
67:56 - now we've lost david he says he froze um
68:00 - hopefully he'll jump on in a sec if he
68:02 - doesn't it's okay but let's go ahead and
68:05 - um he should be joining soon um
68:09 - uh he can just call back david just call
68:12 - back if you're able to see this
68:14 - um and then you can guys jump on that's
68:17 - okay
68:17 - all right now um there we go so now what
68:21 - we're gonna do is
68:23 - we're pretty much gonna we have this
68:26 - so this is awesome everything works as
68:28 - we expected to
68:29 - um and what we're gonna do now is we're
68:32 - gonna basically go ahead and do hey my
68:34 - girlfriend says papa react
68:35 - guys smash the like button if you like
68:38 - the name pop react i think it's stuck
68:40 - pretty well now

68:52 - hell yeah i'll try buying you that's how
68:54 - we actually met guys fun
68:56 - fact for you oh that's how we met we
68:58 - actually swiped right on demo
69:00 - yeah awesome um so let's go ahead and
69:03 - check it out so now guys
69:05 - we want to build the bottom which is
69:08 - this bit right here
69:10 - right juwan says are you okay sonny you
69:12 - look tired today we love you i'm good
69:13 - dude i'm pumped
69:15 - right i'm pumped i know we just ran an
69:16 - absolute massive challenge
69:18 - but the value does not stop going we're
69:20 - gonna keep bringing the fire with you
69:21 - guys
69:22 - um so the next bit right now app.js
69:25 - let's go ahead and build those swipe
69:27 - buttons okay
69:28 - so at the bottom of the page we have
69:31 - swipe buttons over here so i'm going to
69:33 - go ahead and add that end
69:35 - for our build because right now our
69:36 - build doesn't have it so i'm going to go
69:38 - ahead and do the following so
69:40 - say swipe buttons and then i'm going to
69:43 - copy this
69:44 - do this and save and you see it freaks
69:47 - out because we don't have that file
69:48 - so swipe buttons.js boom
69:51 - um but new paragraphs just saying that
69:54 - i'm going to pay for the course but i'm
69:55 - interested in the course
69:57 - i would highly recommend it if you can
69:59 - somewhere or another like just
70:00 - all i will say to that is make sure you
70:04 - take full advantage of discounted price
70:06 - while it's available that's all i can
70:08 - say to you dude because
70:09 - after 12 days the price will go up um
70:12 - so yeah and that's the way we have to do
70:14 - it so that we keep the quality
70:16 - of everyone inside the pwj top notch
70:19 - okay now here i'm going to go ahead and
70:23 - import
70:23 - the correct css file this is going to
70:26 - say swipe buttons
70:27 - dot css and save and it's going to freak
70:30 - out again
70:31 - because it doesn't have a css file so
70:33 - let's go ahead and create that
70:35 - um oh dude i love this look shazeeb
70:38 - saleem says sunny is anywhere i can take
70:39 - direct classes from you because i love
70:41 - the way you teach and your coding
70:42 - concepts a huge love for me bro keep it
70:43 - up
70:44 - um actually that's a very good question
70:46 - so i run coaching calls
70:49 - on every single tuesday i run coaching
70:52 - course
70:52 - um inside the course so you can actually
70:54 - be on there and you can actually learn
70:56 - on those coaching culturals directly
70:57 - with me
70:58 - now i do one-on-one coaching feel free
71:00 - to reach out to me whether it's
71:01 - instagram or whether it's on the course
71:03 - um yeah and you can do that nice
71:06 - so now on swipe buttons.js i'm actually
71:09 - going to go ahead and
71:10 - let me go ahead and say uh to david
71:13 - where you are where
71:14 - are you ah there we go so now
71:17 - inside of app.js i'm going to go ahead
71:19 - and say
71:21 - import um swipe buttons
71:25 - so import swipe buttons from
71:30 - swipe buttons there we go save it
71:33 - and that should stop it from freaking
71:35 - out okay
71:37 - now what we're going to do is we're
71:38 - going to go ahead and
71:40 - um build out this component all right my
71:43 - government says get coaching calls with
71:45 - sonny you won't go with gray
71:46 - and guys honestly like i'm not joking
71:49 - like the people who have actually jumped
71:50 - on those coaching calls have got insane
71:52 - results so like yeah you heard her now
71:55 - we've got a few questions here let's go
71:57 - ahead and answer them quickly before we

72:26 - um how much will it go up guys it goes
72:28 - up by a hundred dollars
72:29 - after this sunday and then it goes up uh
72:32 - then the doors close after 12 days so
72:35 - like
72:36 - really really can't stress enough um and
72:39 - beyond that i'm gonna pretty much carry
72:40 - on coding because
72:42 - let's just drop some more value guys for
72:43 - you guys okay now i'm gonna turn the
72:45 - volume a little bit down
72:46 - because i've seen a few people saying
72:47 - it's gonna be a little bit distracting
72:49 - um yeah give me one sec david i'll share
72:51 - the screen with you
72:53 - there we go awesome dude can you see it
72:56 - all right so now
73:00 - um okay so now what we're going to do is
73:03 - uh
73:04 - yeah so loads of people asking what the
73:05 - link is guys link is in the description
73:08 - like literally first link in the
73:09 - description go ahead and check it out
73:11 - and you guys can pretty much see what
73:13 - we're talking about
73:14 - right now we've got the swipe buttons
73:15 - we're gonna build next so swipe buttons
73:17 - over here
73:19 - let's go ahead and at the bottom of the
73:22 - page
73:23 - let's go ahead and add that in
73:28 - so somebody says uh my government has
73:31 - any of the challenges influenced during
73:32 - coding she's actually a badass dude in
73:34 - coding
73:35 - like i thought i would i will be
73:37 - teaching her full-on react and redux and
73:39 - i'm just gonna
73:41 - overload her with that stuff
73:44 - she's gonna be my right-hand man and
73:46 - these uh on these uh on these coding
73:48 - calls uh
73:48 - i'll be awesome david we're gonna have
73:50 - to make room
73:52 - all right let's go so we've got the
73:54 - we're gonna do a bunch of imports over
73:56 - here
73:56 - and then remember guys we wrap the
73:58 - buttons in icon button so
74:00 - what i'm going to do now is actually pop
74:01 - out an entire snippet here
74:03 - of all of these icons wrapped in icon
74:05 - buttons
74:06 - all right now what i'm going to do is
74:09 - i'm actually going to go ahead and say
74:12 - um i'm gonna get rid of this on click
74:14 - because we don't care about that too
74:16 - much to be honest
74:17 - i'm gonna go ahead and say doom doom
74:20 - doom doom
74:21 - get rid of that and then here swipe
74:23 - buttons repeat is the class name and
74:25 - we've got font size of large
74:27 - and now you can see nothing's over here
74:28 - right so you've got each one has its own
74:31 - style it has left star right lightning
74:34 - so that way we can go ahead and style
74:36 - them
74:36 - right as we need to um
74:40 - right now why do i feel after pw get
74:43 - uh guess full the youtube video builds
74:45 - will stop coming
74:46 - dude that's insane that is never gonna
74:49 - happen dude
74:50 - i've literally dropped the fire before
74:52 - this stuff like literally before we open
74:54 - the doors so don't stress
74:56 - we will keep bringing the value okay now
74:59 - muhammad ishaq says i'm leaving bro and
75:01 - asked for my question dude like
75:03 - we got we got so many questions like if
75:05 - it gets buried
75:06 - chill all right so now what we're going
75:08 - to do next is we're going to go ahead
75:10 - and
75:11 - um style this stuff so here we've got
75:14 - everything
75:15 - appropriately named with the classes and
75:17 - we're going to go ahead and do
75:19 - the following swipe buttons and also
75:21 - guys keep it positive in the chat
75:22 - right there's no room for negativity
75:24 - here if you'd literally talk negative
75:26 - i'm gonna block you so
75:27 - let's keep it positive so swipe buttons
75:30 - let's go ahead and say dot swipe buttons
75:33 - um and then here for the buttons i'm
75:35 - gonna say position fixed bottom of 10
75:37 - view height so it's bottom from the top
75:40 - um it's going to be 10 view height away
75:42 - from the bottom
75:43 - then we're going to say display flex
75:44 - width of 100 and justify content to
75:47 - space evenly
75:48 - now you can see it comes to the bottom
75:49 - really nicely so smash the thumbs up
75:51 - button if that was clean because that
75:53 - adds things really nicely now you can
75:54 - see it does look very clean
75:56 - and then we're going to say for the
75:58 - large buttons
76:00 - we're going to go ahead and say
76:03 - padding of 200 pixels um i think we
76:06 - don't actually need that
76:07 - because we don't actually use large
76:10 - anymore yep so we don't actually need
76:12 - that one
76:12 - let me get rid of that um
76:16 - okay this is awesome dude so hajjot
76:18 - singh says sun you have zero knowledge
76:19 - about all of this stuff i don't know
76:21 - anything about all of this should i
76:22 - enroll in this i'm a little afraid
76:24 - i don't know how to enroll because it's
76:26 - you say it's a hundred dollars but it
76:27 - shows 597 no dude
76:28 - it's actually a discount of a hundred
76:30 - dollars so after sunday
76:32 - that price goes to seven hundred dollars
76:35 - so it'll be 6.97
76:36 - um and that's what we're trying to say
76:38 - there and i would recommend
76:40 - if you if you have no coding experience
76:43 - then you
76:43 - definitely go ahead and join okay now i
76:46 - just saw
76:47 - somebody else joined uh we have vino
76:51 - djy9 i think if you join then let us
76:54 - know
76:55 - that's awesome uh welcome nice welcome
76:58 - dude
76:58 - nice yeah um so it's a hundred dollar
77:02 - discount until sunday and then the price
77:04 - goes
77:05 - up and it doesn't come back down so i
77:07 - hope that cleared that up for you
77:08 - um so now what we're going to do guys is
77:10 - we're going to target all of the
77:12 - material ui buttons and the way we're
77:13 - going to do that is we say swipe buttons
77:15 - and we say
77:16 - all of the material ui icon buttons root
77:18 - and this is the class name that gets
77:19 - given to it when it joins up but when it
77:22 - goes ahead and um adds it to the file so
77:26 - there you go
77:26 - we can actually add a box shadow and we
77:28 - added a background color of white
77:30 - and you get this nice hovering effect
77:32 - okay
77:33 - now uh pratya yeah this is awesome
77:36 - pratya's head
77:36 - took it for 497 yesterday exactly dude
77:40 - pratya is going ahead and validating
77:42 - what i'm saying right now because
77:44 - yesterday the price was 4.97 we weren't
77:46 - joking when we said it goes up
77:48 - it literally went up but at the end of
77:51 - that live stream like we promised
77:52 - now it's 5.97 after sunday it goes up
77:56 - again
77:57 - and i'm not joking it's not gonna come
77:58 - back down guys so
78:01 - don't mess around don't miss out and i'm
78:03 - saying this because i care guys like i
78:05 - want you guys
78:06 - to value from the amount of love and
78:08 - respect that we put into that course
78:10 - um it's gonna change your life right now
78:13 - for the rest of the um
78:17 - classes i want different colors so i
78:20 - went ahead and done
78:21 - is basically targeted the rest of them
78:23 - so this is what i just copied in right
78:24 - here
78:26 - and you can pause and you can pretty
78:27 - much copy this code out and
78:29 - we've added three view width height
78:31 - three view it to each of them
78:33 - a padding and we've changed the colors
78:36 - so you see and then we've got each of
78:37 - these individual colors and now
78:39 - it gets a lovely tinder refill okay so
78:41 - it's got that nice little tinder feel to
78:43 - it
78:43 - nice everything looks pretty clean okay
78:47 - so that's super like jeff bezos yeah
78:49 - that's super like jeff bezos dude that's
78:51 - awesome right
78:52 - now at this point rather than pulling
78:55 - right so
78:56 - right now this this ui is hard coded
79:00 - okay
79:00 - so it's hard coded so if we actually go
79:02 - back to tinder cards we can see that
79:04 - i've hard coded the values here
79:06 - we have elon musk we have jeff bezos but
79:08 - everything is not
79:10 - you know i want this to be qui like this
79:12 - is not
79:13 - so wono jung says i took it 597 today
79:16 - but
79:16 - no regrets let's go dude that's what i'm
79:20 - talking about

79:58 - 2000 dude i'm telling you this price is

80:01 - like this course is way under price
80:03 - right now

84:46 - all right so tinder back-end exactly
84:50 - that will put you in the correct folder
84:52 - okay nice
84:53 - and if you want to turn on git version
84:55 - control you can just go ahead and type
84:56 - and get in it okay
84:58 - so that will actually go ahead and
84:59 - initialize git okay exactly we will need
85:02 - it uh later by the way
85:03 - okay and now you can go ahead and type
85:06 - in mpm
85:06 - init it's going to throw you a couple of
85:10 - questions
85:10 - uh regarding your node.js application
85:13 - right
85:14 - so uh just such as so guys yeah what's
85:16 - that mpm
85:17 - init right exactly all right so
85:19 - non-capitals so it shouldn't mean
85:20 - capitals with some screaming at you guys
85:22 - npm in it
85:23 - and that will go ahead and set up your
85:25 - package.json and get everything set up
85:27 - so npm
85:27 - and you can see when we do that what
85:30 - happens
85:30 - you see a lot of questions and and all
85:33 - those stuff that i've never
85:35 - ever read yeah so now i can go ahead and
85:38 - hit enter right
85:39 - in the background is pretty good let's
85:41 - go ahead and do that version one okay
85:42 - enter
85:44 - um description if you want to go ahead
85:46 - and type in something uh you can go
85:48 - uh for entry point we usually do
85:51 - uh server.js okay so server.js not
85:55 - index.js right server.js
85:57 - okay exactly um
86:00 - test command you can skip that yep then
86:02 - guys just want to stress out that point
86:04 - right here we have
86:05 - server dot js so we wrote that we said
86:10 - server oops
86:13 - server dot js okay you want to type that
86:16 - in when it comes up
86:17 - and that's very important um nice let's
86:20 - carry on david
86:22 - test come on exactly uh you can just go
86:24 - and and hit return a couple of times
86:27 - until author comes up and you can type
86:29 - in your name if you want to but
86:30 - it's not necessary and it's gonna ask if
86:32 - it's okay you can just go ahead and hit
86:34 - yes
86:35 - okay so i can just hit enter yeah
86:37 - exactly exactly
86:38 - and let's go ahead and check yeah oh
86:40 - nice we got this package.json okay
86:42 - exactly and that created uh a
86:46 - package.json for us okay
86:49 - now under uh main server.js
86:54 - you can type in type module so that it
86:56 - will elevate the whole thing to
86:58 - es6 ver es6
87:02 - type of code right so let's just explain
87:04 - very clearly what we're doing here so
87:06 - guys whenever you're coding on the back
87:09 - end right whenever you're doing node.js
87:11 - you need to remember that things like
87:14 - import so stuff like that we're used to
87:16 - this kind of syntax importing this is
87:18 - es6 right this is like a latest sort of
87:21 - javascript sort of stuff
87:23 - now in order to get that on node.js
87:25 - node.js by default doesn't have
87:27 - support for like um import and things
87:30 - like that you have to write const a
87:32 - variable name and then you have to write
87:33 - equals require
87:34 - but we don't want to do that we want to
87:36 - have that nice syntax that juicy syntax
87:38 - so
87:38 - how do we go ahead and add that david so
87:40 - here what do i do
87:42 - you can just type in uh type type
87:46 - exactly and we're doing type oops
87:49 - type and column and module
87:53 - module there we go exactly and just a
87:56 - comma
87:57 - and one thing you need to add uh
88:01 - is actually right under uh right in the
88:03 - script
88:05 - okay that you want to add a start script
88:07 - right okay
88:08 - so i'm gonna add a start script yup
88:11 - and that's going to be node space
88:14 - server.js nice
88:18 - okay so we've got node space
88:21 - server.js we added this line in here and
88:24 - we added this one here type module
88:26 - okay exactly save on that
88:29 - nice now what i'm going to do guys is
88:31 - let's go ahead and create that server.js
88:33 - right
88:35 - of course nice so is this our server
88:38 - david is this where our whole backend is
88:40 - going to be exactly
88:42 - this is the only file i mean not only
88:45 - but
88:46 - this is where all the logic will go okay
88:48 - we will need
88:49 - one more file but this is where all the
88:51 - logic goes
88:53 - so first up uh we need to install a
88:55 - couple of dependencies right
88:57 - okay so let's open up our terminal
89:00 - go ahead and let's type in npm
89:04 - i or npm install
89:07 - and let's type in express and mongoose
89:11 - express space mongoose that will install
89:14 - both
89:14 - express and mongoose right exactly
89:18 - yeah yeah and we can just wait a little
89:22 - while it sets itself up but in the
89:24 - meantime we can go ahead and create our
89:26 - mongodb database
89:27 - so if we want to do that uh let's go to
89:32 - um mongodb.com
89:35 - okay so i'm gonna go over to mongodb.com
89:38 - also guys if you haven't seen we have
89:40 - the early bird special pricing
89:42 - um we launched proper javascript
89:44 - yesterday
89:45 - and the price went up yesterday so today
89:48 - it's only going to be available at the
89:49 - special price
89:50 - you see at right now so the early bird
89:52 - special price it goes
89:54 - up on sunday it does not come back down
89:57 - it goes up on sunday
89:59 - won't come back down and in 12 days time
90:01 - the doors to profit with javascript
90:04 - close okay so once they close it's going
90:07 - to be closed forever
90:09 - you guys won't be able to get back in
90:10 - after that so don't miss out
90:12 - save yourself some money and really go
90:15 - ahead and join
90:17 - now ankit raj went ahead and joined he
90:19 - says sup sunny i heard a lot about pwj
90:22 - and i thought i can't find any reason
90:23 - not to join the course
90:25 - to be honest i'm really excited to be
90:26 - with you guys over in bwj
90:28 - hey welcome to the community oh welcome
90:31 - nice
90:31 - love that way david what are we doing
90:36 - okay so now we are going to mongodb.com
90:39 - okay
90:40 - and essentially it means that our
90:42 - database is going to be hosted online by
90:44 - default we don't have to worry about
90:46 - hosting our database and stuff like that
90:49 - and you can just go ahead and sign in or
90:51 - in the right in the middle
90:53 - if you don't have an account you can
90:54 - just go ahead and hit start free
90:56 - okay so i'm gonna click on sign in
91:00 - yeah and i'm going to log in because
91:03 - i've actually created an account so you
91:05 - guys can just hit sign in
91:06 - and it's free to do that i'm going to go
91:08 - ahead and jump into my account i think i

91:20 - karin 87 yes once the door is closed
91:23 - it's not going to open up again for a
91:24 - few months
91:25 - um and it's we do that so that we keep
91:28 - the quality of the students high
91:30 - and we only bring in the people that
91:33 - want to learn and want to invest in
91:35 - their future
91:36 - okay so that's why we do that with
91:38 - profit javascript also
91:39 - if you find the course for anything less
91:43 - than a thousand
91:44 - dollars jump and buy it dude because
91:46 - that is a still
91:48 - it will go up over that very shortly
91:52 - so the early bird special price is only
91:54 - temporarily
91:55 - it goes until sunday sunday we increase
91:57 - the price and then in 12 days

96:06 - uh usually
96:07 - more than three so we don't have to
96:09 - worry about it for now we can go back
96:11 - and create our very first api endpoint
96:14 - let's do it who's excited guys drop a
96:17 - comment smash the
96:18 - thumbs up button guys if you're excited
96:20 - for that
96:22 - right exactly with that said guys what
96:25 - we're going to do now david
96:27 - so now we are going to import our
96:29 - express package
96:31 - which we have just installed right
96:33 - before
96:34 - uh creating our database so let's go
96:36 - ahead and type in
96:37 - import express from express and mongoose
96:40 - from mongoose
96:41 - exactly and
96:45 - now actually let's line up how our
96:47 - application is going to look like so we
96:49 - will
96:49 - uh add a couple of comments okay so the
96:52 - first one is going to be app.config
96:54 - nice then we will add the middle layers
96:57 - right yep okay and then we will
97:01 - configure the database so dbconfig
97:04 - then api endpoints and we will add a
97:08 - listener dbconfig api
97:11 - endpoints and listener
97:15 - listener okay so this is that same
97:17 - technique that we do earlier
97:19 - um and david i just brought a question
97:21 - on for you um somebody actually asked
97:23 - you
97:23 - david started coding in march how did he
97:25 - become so good wow david go ahead and
97:27 - tell them
97:29 - well i put in crazy amount of hours
97:33 - like there were several nights where i
97:35 - was up till like 4 00 a.m
97:38 - or or so so
97:41 - yeah i i was working crazy hard to get
97:43 - this far right
97:44 - no that's the only way it works did you
97:47 - join david
97:48 - uh pwj in the court like were you part
97:50 - of pwj or not
97:52 - exactly i joined the after the very very
97:56 - first
97:56 - um challenge back in
98:00 - april or march um
98:03 - and i actually missed out on the deal so
98:06 - it went a hundred dollars up
98:07 - before i joined okay yeah
98:11 - now that same mistake have you made back
98:13 - the money that you
98:14 - that you used yes definitely
98:17 - okay definitely all right dope dude goes
98:20 - up on
98:21 - sunday i'm just i'm just replying to a
98:24 - comment there we go
98:26 - oh okay that's harjo thing says uh one
98:28 - thing i want to ask can i join this
98:29 - tomorrow or is it compulsory to join now
98:31 - no dude as long as you join before
98:33 - sunday there's no rush
98:35 - like isn't just sunday that price goes
98:37 - up it won't come back down so something
98:38 - to bear in mind
98:40 - um okay so now we've got the app config
98:42 - now
98:43 - david how do i do this now
98:47 - we need to actually create an instance
98:49 - so we can do that by typing in const app
98:52 - equals express okay and
98:55 - two brackets okay so that will actually
98:58 - create our instance
98:59 - and next line we need to uh define the
99:02 - port where our application is going to
99:04 - listen
99:05 - so we need to type in poor const port
99:08 - equals
99:10 - process dot environment dot once yeah
99:13 - what's up
99:14 - yep so so i'm just going to pop that in
99:16 - there so we're going to say cons por
99:17 - equals processor environment report or
99:19 - running it on 8001 right exactly right
99:22 - yeah
99:23 - i just want to mention um edwin
99:26 - saram says i want to join asap uh how do
99:29 - i pay the storm is dude just go hit the
99:31 - link in the description scroll all the
99:32 - way to the bottom
99:33 - and you will see this option here to pay
99:36 - with a payment plan
99:38 - just go ahead and hit that join now on
99:40 - the payment plan option
99:41 - and that's how you go ahead and pay an
99:42 - installment dude so
99:44 - yeah hopefully that helps let's carry on
99:46 - dude
99:47 - yeah let's carry on so we will now go
99:51 - ahead and define our very first
99:53 - api endpoint uh for now we don't need to
99:55 - worry about middlewares and
99:57 - dbconfig so we can just go ahead and
100:00 - type in
100:00 - um under api endpoints
100:03 - uh app.get okay so here
100:06 - going to say um wait an api endpoints
100:09 - right so here yeah yeah
100:10 - okay so we will yeah we will
100:13 - do app again and yeah and we're just
100:16 - going to
100:16 - go with a slash because this is going to
100:19 - be
100:20 - the root uh or the base url actually
100:23 - and we will have a callback function
100:25 - with a request and a response parameter
100:29 - and let's just create a an arrow
100:31 - function
100:32 - which will set the result or response
100:35 - status
100:39 - of 200 response status is 200 which
100:42 - means okay
100:44 - which means okay and we will just going
100:46 - to send
100:47 - hello world right
100:50 - hello world hello
100:54 - hello clever programmers hey let's do
100:56 - that dude hello
100:58 - clever programs that way you know it's
100:59 - working
101:01 - exactly okay it's going to be super
101:03 - helpful later on and now we need to add
101:05 - the listener
101:06 - okay um which which is literally just
101:10 - one line of code
101:11 - we will uh say app dot listen
101:14 - yup so app.net yeah and open up a
101:18 - bracket
101:19 - yeah um which would say port
101:22 - and it will have another uh callback
101:24 - function
101:26 - and we just want a console.log listening
101:29 - on localhost and
101:31 - the board and actually use backtext
101:33 - because we will use
101:34 - uh string concatenation okay so
101:36 - listening on localhost
101:38 - of course we're going to use our port
101:40 - right yes
101:42 - that's correct okay and that is pretty
101:44 - much it
101:45 - it should be now working so if you go
101:48 - ahead and
101:49 - uh start up our application using
101:51 - nodemon
101:52 - okay uh it's actually an another mpm
101:55 - uh package so guys if you don't have it
101:57 - you can just go ahead
101:58 - and install it by typing in mpm
102:01 - install node mod sudo npm install oh
102:05 - yeah except
102:06 - exactly that's g node mod that's correct
102:08 - because we want to
102:10 - install it globally yeah which means
102:11 - that it doesn't matter what project
102:12 - you're in nodemon is basically like a
102:14 - tool that you're going to be running on
102:16 - your terminal so we want to install it
102:17 - globally for everything
102:19 - for any project that you want to have so
102:20 - you're going to have to run this command
102:22 - right here
102:22 - i'm actually going to go ahead and
102:23 - double check that i've done it so i'll
102:25 - do it for you guys as well
102:27 - i'm not sure what's happening in this
102:28 - computer there we go so i think this is
102:32 - with this pseudo and sg it will install
102:34 - globally so you don't have to worry
102:36 - about it ever
102:38 - right yep nice
102:41 - okay so now how do i get this thing
102:44 - started david so
102:45 - uh so now let's go ahead and type in
102:49 - uh nodemon server.js
102:52 - and it should be up and running okay
102:56 - and you can see here guys this is
102:57 - actually saying the esm module loader is
102:59 - experimental that's because we added
103:01 - that es6 functionality
103:03 - over here and then where it says
103:06 - listening on localhost 8001 is when we
103:09 - actually did
103:10 - this over here right
103:13 - exactly nice exactly all right so now we
103:16 - have our very first api endpoint
103:19 - uh let's go ahead and let's connect to
103:22 - our database so if we can go back
103:24 - to mongodb.com i think it's always good
103:26 - to show them that it's actually running
103:29 - oh that is correct yeah so we actually
103:32 - have like
103:32 - so now we have it running yeah you can
103:34 - go ahead and type in localhost
103:37 - 801 okay so localhost 8001 is what we
103:41 - chose to run it on
103:42 - oops 8001 and if we do this by default
103:46 - it will go to the forward slash route so
103:47 - let's go ahead and hit enter
103:49 - hey there we go dude nice there we go
103:52 - exactly nice
103:56 - nice yeah so now our health check api is
103:58 - working
103:59 - awesome dude so with that done
104:02 - now let's go ahead and let's connect to
104:04 - our database okay all right and what do
104:06 - we do now
104:08 - so we now go to mongodb.com back
104:11 - to our database hopefully our cluster is
104:13 - now built up
104:15 - and is working yep yeah there we go
104:18 - and on the left hand side yep
104:22 - on the left hand side there is a
104:23 - database access and a network access
104:25 - button
104:26 - okay uh so let's go with the database
104:28 - access first
104:29 - okay so let me go ahead and click on
104:32 - database access there we go
104:35 - yeah exactly and now we will just create
104:38 - a database user so
104:39 - just go ahead and type hit the green
104:42 - button in the middle
104:43 - okay add new database user done
104:47 - and all you need to worry about is the
104:50 - two
104:50 - uh text box in the middle so let's
104:52 - actually add the name
104:54 - which we can call uh i don't know tinder
104:56 - client or admin
104:57 - it's called admin yeah okay and you can
105:01 - go ahead
105:02 - and auto generate a secure password
105:04 - right i'm going to show you guys because
105:06 - we don't really care at this point for
105:07 - this one
105:08 - so we're going to have this but make
105:10 - sure you
105:11 - copy this copy this guy
105:14 - because once you lose this you can't get
105:17 - it back
105:18 - exactly and this is the only time that
105:20 - you will see it so
105:22 - make sure to save it in somewhere safe
105:24 - and let's just go ahead and add the user
105:26 - with the green button down there
105:27 - okay add user let's do it boom we have a
105:30 - user nice
105:31 - there we go and now let's go to network
105:34 - access
105:35 - okay okay and
105:38 - add an ip address uh to the allow list
105:42 - okay uh let's actually allow uh access
105:46 - from anywhere
105:48 - we don't want to mess around with uh
105:50 - anything else and let's just confirm it
105:52 - done now guys that's not something you
105:55 - want to do
105:56 - in like a professional environment we're
105:58 - just doing that because we're demoing
106:00 - this so it's going to be
106:01 - something which we just don't want we
106:03 - want to demo it right now so we don't
106:04 - really care about the security but
106:06 - something to note do not do that in
106:08 - professional environments
106:10 - yeah and and actually drop it in the
106:12 - comments if you're interested how to
106:13 - secure
106:14 - stuff like this um if there is interest
106:17 - we can definitely do a video on it
106:18 - exactly right yeah okay now let's go
106:22 - back to
106:22 - clusters on the upper left-hand side
106:26 - okay um clusters on the left-hand side
106:30 - do yep um
106:34 - and under the connect button
106:38 - yep now
106:40 - we should be did you click it oh
106:43 - you said okay yeah yeah just go ahead
106:46 - and yeah sorry
106:47 - uh just click it and in the middle uh
106:50 - we want to connect our application so
106:52 - just go ahead and click the middle one
106:54 - and that is the that is going to be the
106:56 - link
106:57 - or or the connection url which we will
107:00 - be using to connect to our database
107:02 - now actually uh notice that there is the
107:05 - password
107:07 - right in the middle of your screen
107:08 - that's where you will have to
107:10 - uh paste in the password that you just
107:13 - copied
107:14 - and the other one is db name that's
107:16 - where you will hard code
107:17 - and and define what you want to
107:21 - call your database right right so at
107:23 - this point guys copy this
107:25 - okay go to your code go up to app config
107:29 - over here right const and do this right
107:32 - now right connection
107:34 - url and just paste it as a
107:37 - uh do back yeah and then here where we
107:41 - have password
107:42 - go ahead and that one that we copied
107:44 - earlier go ahead and chuck that
107:46 - here so i'm gonna go ahead and do this
107:50 - you don't have to do it like oh yeah so
107:52 - i mean
107:53 - you don't have to yeah sorry what am i
107:54 - doing yeah oops
107:57 - yeah too much too much gets carried away
107:59 - you know
108:00 - yeah yeah and what about this david
108:02 - tired
108:05 - yeah what about this one david um we can
108:08 - call it tinderdb
108:10 - or some something whatever so this one
108:13 - this is actually the database name and
108:15 - this will actually create a database
108:17 - based on what we add here so let's call
108:19 - this one
108:20 - uh tinder db well let's just do intended
108:24 - db
108:24 - like this okay yeah that's right
108:28 - and now let's go to app uh sorry config
108:32 - and that is where we will actually uh
108:35 - connect to our database right okay
108:37 - so let's type in uh mongoose.connect
108:40 - um mongoose.connect uh
108:44 - okay and connect
108:49 - mongoose.connect and inside the brackets
108:51 - that's where you
108:52 - add the connection url right
108:56 - and actually add the comma right after
108:59 - connection url and we need to
109:01 - pass in a couple of parameters to our
109:04 - connection
109:06 - uh if you could just copy paste them in
109:10 - yeah so these are actually parameters
109:13 - that
109:14 - are used uh to make our connection very
109:17 - smooth
109:18 - uh this is just because mangoes is under
109:20 - development and constant evolvation
109:23 - so that's why we need
109:26 - uh we need to add these okay all right
109:29 - um with that done
109:33 - um let's go ahead and create our uh
109:36 - database schema
109:38 - okay right so a database schema is like
109:40 - a model right
109:43 - yeah exactly uh so we need to like
109:45 - create a new folder
109:47 - okay so what do we need do we need the
109:49 - photo can we just do it here
109:51 - oh we can just do it right there okay so
109:53 - let's create a screen
109:54 - for a file what's this one going to be
109:55 - called uh
109:57 - db cards okay db cards all right this
110:00 - can be a js file
110:01 - and this is basically gonna outline the
110:03 - structure of the
110:05 - the the cards inside the database right
110:07 - the tinder cards
110:10 - exactly exactly and now let's import
110:13 - mongoose once again
110:17 - and we will be creating a new card
110:19 - schema
110:21 - so let's type in const card schema
110:23 - equals
110:24 - mongoose ducks language dot schema
110:28 - go ahead and i'll pop a snippet in here
110:29 - guys so we have the card schema right
110:32 - here and we've been saying mongoose
110:33 - schema and we're passing in this is a
110:34 - structure right here right
110:37 - exactly this is how our database uh
110:40 - fields are gonna be
110:41 - built up right yeah and now
110:44 - let's go ahead and export default uh
110:47 - this whole thing right all this stuff
110:50 - oh nice we actually got a um this is
110:52 - awesome dude
110:53 - victor bravo says i like victor brother
110:56 - he goes to
110:56 - donation and he goes uh angler dev here
110:59 - just passing by and loving react hey i
111:01 - love that dude
111:02 - thanks for watching that's insane thank
111:05 - you corey also jumped back in he said
111:06 - dedicated appreciate you guys keep the
111:08 - energy up that grind heart
111:10 - you guys are changing the world one
111:11 - programmer at a time that's what we're
111:13 - talking about dude
111:14 - whoa that's exactly the kind of energy
111:16 - love you corey
111:17 - all right let's go ahead and so image
111:20 - url okay
111:22 - exactly and now just let's go and and
111:24 - export
111:25 - uh the whole schema so export default uh
111:28 - mangostop model
111:30 - and this is where we would define
111:34 - the collection name so okay uh remember
111:38 - if you're coming from a sql database a
111:40 - sql background
111:41 - um there is something called tables now
111:43 - this is
111:44 - the exact same thing uh it's just called
111:47 - collections right now
111:48 - okay so i wouldn't say it's the same
111:50 - thing guys
111:51 - uh so in sql you have tables
111:55 - and that sort of structure right and in
111:56 - nosql you have this
111:58 - collection uh document collection
112:01 - document so that's just to sort of
112:02 - simplify so
112:03 - let's quickly draw it down here so in no
112:06 - in nosql you pretty much have this
112:07 - collection
112:09 - uh document and collection then you have
112:11 - an array of documents
112:14 - right and then you have an array and
112:17 - then that can that can also have a
112:19 - collection of its own
112:21 - and that can have an array of documents
112:23 - and basically the pattern goes on
112:24 - right you can keep on doing this right
112:26 - that's this is a nosql database this one
112:29 - this structure right
112:30 - try not to confuse it with sql it's a
112:33 - very very different outline and and i'd
112:35 - just completely separate the two that
112:38 - will help you out when it comes to
112:39 - building this
112:40 - uh ashavia oh nice dude we got a
112:42 - donation
112:44 - whoa thank you and check it out
112:47 - whoa amazing love the value
112:51 - uh yes because just a few damn
112:54 - sonny how are you feeling today hey he
112:57 - says love the body that we added in the
112:58 - skills in just a few days time thank you
113:00 - dude
113:00 - uh how are you feeling today yeah i'm
113:02 - feeling a little bit better still a
113:04 - little bit rough
113:04 - but we'll get there dude with you guys
113:06 - energy it's it's
113:08 - it's impossible to not get better dude
113:10 - so
113:11 - let's keep going strong nice nice okay
113:14 - so let's
113:15 - pop in uh some kind of collection name
113:18 - that you want to
113:19 - call it i called it i actually
113:22 - personally like
113:23 - cards okay so this cards
113:27 - cards and we need to pass in the card
113:29 - schema right after
113:31 - okay so i do cards like this right
113:35 - exactly and with that done we pretty
113:39 - much have our
113:40 - uh database structure built up okay
113:43 - and now let's go back and actually
113:46 - create our first
113:47 - uh endpoint that will actually add
113:50 - the data into our database right okay so
113:55 - we need to type in app.post and post is
113:58 - a
113:59 - uploading method okay for apis we have
114:02 - different yeah exactly
114:04 - requests right we have get we have posts
114:06 - we have put update all those ones right
114:09 - yeah exactly good
114:12 - so let's go and type in up that post
114:15 - okay
114:18 - yep and let's define an endpoint which
114:21 - could like i don't know uh tinder
114:24 - cards okay or just cards
114:28 - yep yep and it will have a callback
114:30 - function with a request on the response
114:32 - parameter
114:32 - okay so we've got a request and a
114:35 - response
114:36 - response yep and
114:39 - first up we want to save the uh request
114:42 - body into a
114:44 - variable right so let's type in cod db
114:46 - cards
114:47 - or db card so we can say const db card
114:50 - equals request request
114:54 - the body okay exactly and before we go
114:57 - any further let's go up and import our
115:00 - database structure so let's type in
115:03 - import
115:04 - cards from uh
115:08 - from db cards
115:12 - there we go exactly go ahead
115:16 - okay now let's go down there and
115:19 - type in cards.create
115:23 - so that will and that is going to be a
115:25 - function
115:26 - that creates the creates a new document
115:30 - right so
115:32 - cars are create we pass in db card okay
115:36 - and this will have a callback function
115:39 - with an error and the data um
115:43 - parameters right
115:47 - and now we want to handle the errors
115:51 - so if there is an error okay
115:54 - uh we will say response that status
115:58 - uh set to 500 which means internal
116:01 - server error
116:02 - and and we send the error back
116:06 - right yep else
116:09 - we will say response dot status 201
116:14 - which means uh created okay right
116:17 - so that means we successfully created
116:19 - our uh
116:20 - stuff and we just send back the data
116:23 - okay what we just created right yep
116:26 - okay and to actually see that it uh
116:29 - does work we need to define another
116:31 - endpoint which will
116:32 - uh download the data from the database
116:35 - so
116:36 - let's actually create another endpoint
116:38 - okay so post
116:39 - usually to push information into into
116:42 - our database and get is to get the
116:44 - information right
116:46 - exactly so we will type in app.gap okay
116:49 - that means downloading data right um
116:53 - the endpoint could be the same the cards
116:55 - there we go
116:56 - yeah okay all right and
117:00 - it's gonna be almost the exact same so
117:02 - you can just
117:03 - uh copy paste like almost everything
117:06 - okay
117:07 - um request response there we go
117:11 - and yeah that part
117:14 - and what we need to change there are two
117:17 - pieces of stuff that we need to change
117:19 - the first
117:19 - is cards uh we do not want to create a
117:22 - new card we want to
117:24 - find a card right and we do not need the
117:27 - db card
117:28 - right there right after okay
117:32 - and we can just delete that and leave it
117:34 - right there
117:35 - and the other thing we want to change is
117:38 - the
117:38 - response status upon success and we want
117:42 - to send
117:43 - set that to 200. right
117:47 - so with this we will be retrieving
117:51 - every single thing uh from that
117:53 - collection
117:54 - from the database that we just created
117:57 - right
117:59 - okay so now
118:02 - we can actually open up a postman if you
118:04 - want to and
118:06 - check out all these stuff nice before we
118:08 - do that luis pedro just

119:48 - download it and then let's go ahead and
119:50 - open postman
119:53 - right so it's just loading up right now
119:58 - it should be on our screen in just a
120:00 - second there we go
120:02 - nice awesome
120:07 - so once it's open okay
120:11 - uh we can pretty much just type in the
120:13 - whole uh url that we just created
120:16 - so what we will be doing is
120:19 - uh let's just type in uh localhost
120:24 - https
120:35 - let's test it first so let's go ahead
120:36 - and hit send okay
120:38 - and we should see hello clever

120:42 - that's your sanity that means that
120:44 - you're at the right place everything's
120:45 - good
120:47 - exactly and now we can add the endpoint
120:52 - which is slash tinder slash cards right
120:55 - okay
120:57 - and before we go any further let's uh
121:00 - no it's not going to work i mean yeah
121:03 - it's retrieved that there is nothing in
121:04 - the database okay it's actually working
121:06 - yeah it's just showing nothing because
121:08 - there we have a pretty empty uh database
121:11 - but to actually add data into the
121:13 - database we need to set
121:15 - the method to post right yeah
121:18 - and we need to add a body which is just
121:22 - right under the url
121:23 - over here okay exactly yeah and just uh
121:27 - hit raw
121:27 - in the middle and on the right hand side
121:30 - let's actually
121:31 - uh yeah change it to json because we
121:33 - will be adding the italian
121:35 - json format so now um
121:39 - you can go ahead and
121:42 - copy paste the hard-coded uh thing from
121:45 - our code
121:46 - okay also i just want to see alexandra's
121:49 - tuition says why not use the rest vs
121:51 - code extension
121:52 - dude i didn't know there was one i
121:55 - didn't know either
121:56 - yeah let's go check that wait rest
121:59 - um vs rest client is that the one rest

122:27 - forget it
122:28 - so let's go back to middlewares that was
122:30 - actually naveen
122:31 - naveen ts actually pointed that out
122:33 - thank you dude
122:34 - yeah oh great job thank you
122:38 - so we need to add the middleware
122:41 - um which is app.use
122:44 - okay and in the brackets we would just
122:48 - add
122:49 - express dot json okay right
122:52 - right okay nice oh nice
122:56 - it's only so dope it's like having
122:57 - postman already in react oh sure i'm
122:59 - going to check that out guys 100 i
123:01 - checked out
123:02 - um oh nice okay so
123:06 - you can just go ahead and copy paste the
123:08 - uh hard-coded
123:10 - thing we have in our front and right uh
123:13 - yeah i actually want to add one thing
123:15 - here guys we want to add cause to our
123:18 - application
123:19 - so of course that's just later down the
123:20 - road but okay uh yeah but we might as
123:22 - well
123:23 - i think we should add it now no okay
123:24 - yeah we can we can add it definitely so
123:26 - let's go ahead cut our app
123:28 - here and then let's go ahead and do mpmi
123:30 - so i'm going to go ahead and make sure
123:30 - that's visible for you guys mpi
123:32 - cores and guys cause is basically adding
123:35 - headers
123:36 - to every request right and it's
123:38 - basically a security prerequisite
123:39 - especially when you have things deployed
123:41 - online
123:42 - so what we're going to do at the top is
123:43 - we're going to have import cause from
123:45 - cause
123:46 - so import cause from
123:49 - cause cause like that and then what
123:52 - we're gonna do is here
123:53 - we're gonna go ahead and say app dot use
123:58 - course like this and that will actually
124:01 - go ahead and do everything that we need
124:02 - and then we need to make sure we start
124:03 - our app again nodemon server.js just
124:06 - make sure you do that and that will
124:07 - actually get everything up and running
124:08 - again
124:09 - exactly yeah all right so
124:13 - now we can can we go ahead and add
124:15 - everything
124:16 - yep okay so let's copy paste
124:19 - the hard-coded elon mask in here
124:23 - so i'm just gonna go grab that from our
124:25 - code so tinder cards
124:27 - let's grab this stuff right here yeah
124:31 - and let's actually make sure that
124:34 - we use the exact same field names
124:38 - right so name and i don't remember
124:41 - what we defined in our uh deep cards.js
124:45 - file right so this is actually
124:47 - this is something which we could do man
124:49 - like i don't think we should make it
124:50 - matches as such let's go with this right
124:53 - now
124:54 - and then what we can do is oh it should
124:56 - match so it should match yeah
124:57 - what am i saying it should yeah it
124:59 - should match yeah because i was going to
125:00 - say we would pull in okay now it should
125:02 - be url image i think so inside of
125:04 - db cause it was this one image url right
125:08 - yeah so this one should be image url
125:10 - image url and also guys this has to be
125:13 - add the double quotes yep
125:16 - double quote it up there we go there we
125:19 - go
125:20 - and this was just freaking out nice
125:23 - um let's actually click beautify
125:27 - oh it's because the comma at the very
125:29 - end of the link
125:31 - i think um uh of elon musk's photo link
125:37 - um boom that
125:41 - i think so um i think it's maybe because
125:44 - we
125:44 - haven't we need an array outside of this
125:48 - yeah could be
125:51 - there we go there we go guys that's nice
125:54 - this is not going to be an array there
125:55 - we go
125:56 - okay okay cool and
126:00 - let's hit send and see what we got now
126:03 - this should be pushing this into the db
126:07 - so these two things into db
126:08 - right yeah exactly send
126:12 - let's see what we got there we go
126:16 - nice so you can see here guys it says
126:19 - status 201 created if that says 500
126:22 - then everything just blew up no i'm
126:24 - joking it just went wrong
126:27 - don't freak out just debug it and you
126:28 - can figure out um but yeah 201
126:30 - everything was added david how can we
126:32 - test that we this is actually in the db
126:34 - now
126:36 - we just need to uh change the method
126:38 - back to get
126:39 - okay and we can completely forget about
126:42 - the body uh
126:44 - because get requests do not have uh oops
126:47 - i'm sorry
126:48 - uh get because requests do not have body
126:51 - you can leave it there if you want to
126:53 - it will be totally ignored okay and just
126:55 - go ahead and hit send once again boom
126:58 - and nice dude it says 200 okay
127:01 - and we've got those two fields we've got
127:03 - the name imagery that's perfect dude
127:06 - exactly let's go ahead and hook it up to
127:09 - our front end
127:10 - guys i think david deserves a round of
127:13 - applause for that
127:14 - like he absolutely crushed that guys
127:18 - amazing job dude amazing job smash the
127:20 - like button if you learned something new
127:21 - right thank you
127:22 - nice and everyone's saying bring on the
127:24 - air horn let's go
127:27 - [Music]
127:31 - carry on okay
127:34 - now let's go ahead and hook it up to our
127:37 - front end
127:38 - okay all right
127:42 - so tinder cards
127:48 - where do i go david yep um
127:51 - just right under the uh use date that
127:53 - you defined right
127:54 - okay so you can just i don't know
127:59 - we could actually do it with an axios
128:01 - right so let's go ahead and add a new
128:04 - package so npm install axios if we could
128:07 - run it in the terminal
128:08 - okay make sure you're in the correct
128:10 - terminal so let's go back to our
128:11 - front-end terminal
128:13 - right ahead and we can cut the server
128:15 - right now and let's go ahead and see it
128:16 - says tinder clone to prove that you guys
128:18 - are in the right one
128:19 - and then we're gonna do mpmi axios right
128:23 - exactly yeah and
128:27 - once it's done we will be creating a
128:32 - an axios instance it's basically
128:36 - axios is basically a package that will
128:39 - make http requests super simple right
128:42 - so we create an axios.js right exactly
128:46 - let's go ahead and create an axios.js
128:48 - okay
128:49 - and in the axios.js we will import the
128:53 - axios
128:53 - from axios done done
128:57 - and let's create a instance
129:00 - uh by saying const instance equals
129:03 - axios.create
129:05 - nice oops axios.create
129:08 - nice yup and
129:12 - in there we want to add the parameters
129:16 - and we will only use the base url okay
129:18 - parameter which will be localhost 8001.
129:21 - all right so make sure your http for
129:23 - central just localhost
129:25 - uh 8001. so that's our local right
129:29 - exactly yeah yeah and let's export it
129:33 - okay oh nice
129:36 - my dudes just said hey i just got into
129:39 - pwj
129:40 - let's crush over there guys welcome
129:42 - brother oh nice
129:44 - welcome awesome nice awesome
129:47 - all right um so let's go
129:51 - back okay uh you're just exporting
129:55 - okay uh now let's go back to our tinder
129:57 - cards
129:58 - um okay
130:02 - dot js file yup can i get rid of this
130:04 - now um hard-coded stuff
130:07 - completely completely we will not use
130:09 - that anymore we should just maybe make
130:10 - this an empty array to begin with right
130:13 - yeah exactly that's that's perfect okay
130:15 - and
130:17 - right under that uh we will
130:20 - do something called a use effect okay
130:24 - use effect which is if you're coming
130:25 - from a class-based
130:27 - uh background uh it's actually the
130:29 - component that mount
130:30 - right right so it's actually uh oh we
130:32 - just got another person in pwj
130:34 - nice dude uh he goes jc
130:37 - techdev i just jumped into pwd it's fun
130:40 - nice dude welcome to the community
130:42 - link in the description if you want to
130:43 - be just like this guy come on and join
130:45 - in
130:46 - nice right so uh yeah
130:50 - so use effect guys for those of you guys
130:51 - who aren't familiar with this
130:53 - uh you want to add these empty brackets
130:55 - in here they're very important it means
130:56 - that
130:56 - what this essentially does is when
130:58 - tinder cards loads when the tinder cards
131:00 - component loads it'll run this piece of
131:01 - code once
131:03 - and not run it again okay now this is
131:05 - important because if you add anything
131:07 - inside of these
131:08 - square brackets say for example add name
131:10 - in
131:11 - whenever the variable name changes it's
131:13 - actually going to
131:14 - re-fire this code so it's a very
131:16 - important snippet of code it's a
131:18 - it's a hook which means we need to
131:19 - import it from react
131:21 - so let's go ahead and import boom and
131:23 - then carry on david what are we doing
131:25 - now
131:26 - yeah and actually inside there we will
131:29 - be creating an async function
131:31 - okay so if you could add the async
131:34 - up there or right there okay okay
131:38 - um and we will call it fetch data right
131:43 - uh and inside there we will create a
131:47 - request or or actually it's going to be
131:49 - a variable
131:50 - so const request uh equals evade
131:54 - excels.get so i need to import uh
131:57 - do i need to import the module axis or
131:59 - our local axios
132:01 - the local that you just created so it
132:03 - will be
132:04 - the uh dot forward slash axios one
132:08 - yeah exactly make sure to uh
132:11 - add the full uh dot forward slash uh
132:14 - right before it
132:15 - because if you don't do it it will
132:17 - import the x uh
132:19 - the module and the whole application is
132:21 - gonna crash and freak out
132:22 - yeah so this is very important guys so
132:24 - right here
132:25 - this here is going to be the reason why
132:28 - a lot of people probably bug out
132:30 - um this right here you need that dot
132:33 - forward slash
132:34 - okay exactly whoa
132:37 - thank you thank you antonio cortez
132:41 - thank you so much so await
132:46 - and we will say uh axios.get
132:50 - okay and now we will need to call our
132:55 - endpoint right so forward slash tinder
132:58 - slash cards okay and that's because the
133:01 - base url
133:02 - was already set up inside of axios.js
133:04 - right exactly
133:05 - yeah that's right and
133:09 - we will just need to set the set people
133:12 - to
133:12 - request that data okay so set people so
133:16 - this variable right here let's set that
133:18 - to
133:19 - whatever the request.data comes back as
133:23 - okay exactly and then we need to
133:25 - actually go ahead and say
133:26 - uh fetch the data yeah nice and david
133:30 - this is actually how we
133:31 - if you ever need to do an async function
133:33 - inside of a user effect
133:35 - this is the pattern that everyone
133:36 - actually has to do and it's very very
133:38 - powerful guys um
133:39 - so make sure you do this if you if you
133:42 - ever have any kind of async
133:44 - work inside of a use effect yeah exactly
133:48 - right and because it's
133:51 - added to the uh
133:55 - to the people actually it should be
133:57 - working
133:58 - oh nice that's it out no dude let's go
134:01 - okay
134:02 - so um let's go ahead and refresh
134:07 - uh oh okay one sec this is actually am i
134:10 - running it on
134:10 - okay i'm not running it so this might be
134:12 - npm
134:14 - npm stop boom yeah that's not a bad
134:17 - thing
134:18 - yeah i think we actually should be
134:20 - running it on 3
134:21 - 000 maybe i'm running on 3001 um we'll
134:25 - see anyway here
134:26 - yep so i'm already running something on
134:28 - the 3000 i'm going to go ahead and run
134:29 - on 3001
134:34 - let's go ahead and
134:37 - wait for it tense suspense squares
134:42 - suspense will the development server
134:45 - start
134:46 - oh man god damn it hey
134:50 - let's go but david
134:56 - what is happening hold on oh damn it
135:00 - oh damn right what's going on there are
135:03 - two cards
135:04 - which is good okay so we've got the
135:07 - cards
135:09 - let's debug this dude let's go all right
135:13 - so first thing you should do guys is
135:16 - actually go ahead and console log
135:18 - your people right because we want to see
135:21 - what's inside
135:22 - of the variable so let's go ahead and
135:24 - check it out i'm going to go f12
135:26 - open the inspector hopefully we can find
135:29 - this bug dude
135:31 - open up the array okay this is what we
135:34 - saw
135:34 - came back from the db this is pretty
135:37 - good
135:37 - right you know what the issue is
135:40 - [Music]
135:41 - oh maybe let's go back to our front end
135:44 - let's go ahead let's go see where we
135:48 - render it out we've got
135:50 - um person dot url
135:53 - oh i see dude is it there we go
135:57 - this right here should be image url
136:00 - right that's it nice
136:04 - okay so if i change this to image
136:08 - u r o now guys
136:13 - this is the moment of truth now guys do
136:16 - you think this will work let us know in
136:18 - the comments right now
136:20 - all right let us know in the comments
136:22 - right now do you think this is going to
136:23 - work as soon as i hit

136:30 - the final step everything counts on this
136:32 - david

137:33 - didn't mean to swipe right on kazi there
137:35 - [Laughter]
137:38 - there we go guys that was insane that
137:41 - was awesome stuff
137:42 - david do you want to give them a summary
137:43 - of what just happened
137:46 - so basically what happened uh super
137:48 - quickly
137:49 - is that we will we were rendering out
137:53 - the wrong
137:54 - uh we were trying to get the data
137:58 - from the uh url field but
138:01 - since there is no url field uh it didn't
138:03 - work yeah
138:04 - but then when we changed it to img url
138:07 - uh it started working because there is a
138:09 - field like that
138:10 - yeah and we needed to use img url
138:14 - uh because we defined it it uh in the
138:17 - database structure but if you want to go
138:19 - ahead and
138:21 - redefine uh the url yeah and
138:24 - reload the data into your database it
138:26 - will uh
138:27 - go ahead and work with the url right
138:30 - nice
138:31 - uh so we just needed to match the field
138:33 - names let's show them that we're not
138:35 - lying
138:35 - right let's go to the actual db let's go
138:38 - over here
138:38 - let's close this up let's go to
138:40 - collections which is where our database
138:42 - stuff lives
138:43 - um it's loading the databases right here
138:45 - so you've got tinder db
138:47 - which is that database that we told you
138:48 - guys about so we have
138:50 - the two objects collection nice
138:53 - and let's go ahead and actually copy the
138:56 - image url no no no no
138:57 - you can just rewrite the name i think oh
139:00 - can we

141:34 - so the thing is uh you reached five
141:37 - builds on heroku
141:38 - that means you would need to add your
141:41 - credit card which
141:42 - i think you don't want to do when you're
141:44 - live
141:45 - so you can just delete one of the uh
141:48 - builds
141:49 - settings settings and um down there yeah
141:52 - boom okay you're getting punched
141:56 - right let's go ahead and just like

142:25 - let's just i don't know tinder clone is
142:27 - the perfect name

142:47 - uh commands that we can
142:49 - use to uh push our stuff to heroku
142:54 - okay uh or we could go the boring way
142:56 - which is connecting to our github and
142:58 - it's gonna do it for us
142:59 - for us but let's just not do it because
143:02 - we are become back-end developers and we
143:04 - like to use terminal right
143:05 - okay so
143:10 - let's open up the terminal which we are
143:12 - using to
143:13 - uh act on the back end right okay so

148:05 - installed all the dependencies it built
148:08 - it
148:08 - it done everything we needed um it even
148:10 - pruned it nice okay
148:12 - dope yeah let's go ahead david what are
148:14 - you saying and now you can type in
148:17 - heroku logs dash dash tail
148:19 - okay so somebody's saying it's not going
148:22 - to work somebody's supposed to say
148:23 - profile is needed but let's see if it
148:25 - works
148:26 - uh let's see okay so we now we will see
148:30 - all the uh logs and what's happening
148:35 - somebody's already calling but i mean
148:39 - right it says it's running okay so how
148:42 - can we test this david
148:43 - so let's go back to heroku.com and
148:47 - in the settings if you scroll a bit down
148:50 - uh that's where you will see uh the link
148:56 - yeah your app can be found yeah yeah so
148:58 - yeah and we just uh
149:00 - open it in a new tab and see if it says

149:07 - right so
149:08 - guys whoever said profile i don't want
149:10 - to say it but i kind of do

149:37 - i take it back i take it back guys uh
149:39 - yeah you're gonna need a profile if
149:40 - there's other commands then start so i'm

151:04 - and proud to hear that okay let's go
151:08 - that's it let's go dude so now what
151:10 - we're gonna do is we're gonna set up
151:11 - firebase
151:11 - so firebase is pretty simple to deploy
151:14 - we're going to hit ls to make sure we're
151:16 - in the right directory we've got the
151:17 - stuff tinder clone there we go
151:18 - so now guys we're going to go ahead and
151:20 - say you need to actually make sure

151:38 - have that sudo because it's gonna add it
151:40 - globally so
151:41 - chances are you can need the right
151:42 - permissions now what we're going to do
151:43 - is we're going to say firebase login and
151:45 - then that will actually log you into the
151:46 - correct account
151:47 - um let's see if i'm actually logged into
151:50 - the correct account uh
151:51 - okay so i'm in the right one then we're
151:54 - going to say firebase
