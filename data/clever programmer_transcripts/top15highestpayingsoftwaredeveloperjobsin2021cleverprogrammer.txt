00:00 - yo what is up guys coach daniel here and
00:02 - today we're gonna get into the top
00:04 - 15 paying jobs in software now i have
00:08 - been seeing
00:08 - so many videos out there and some people
00:10 - have been asking like what do software
00:12 - developers actually make what type of
00:13 - software developers
00:14 - make what money and the reality is not a
00:17 - lot of people are putting out the
00:18 - concrete
00:19 - data so what i did is i went into indeed
00:22 - where they have the backed
00:23 - up data because they ask all these
00:25 - engineers what they do how much they
00:27 - make
00:27 - and we're going to dive into the
00:28 - different things dive into the different
00:30 - fields
00:31 - inside software you'll notice some of it
00:32 - might be more i.t related
00:34 - some of it might be more development
00:36 - related and we're gonna dive into these
00:38 - things talk about them just to give you
00:39 - more context
00:40 - and potentially more guidance on the
00:43 - path that you want to take
00:44 - so before we get into it make sure to

01:01 - of software because you're looking to
01:02 - become a software developer and you want
01:04 - to go into one of these jobs
01:06 - i want you to click the link below
01:08 - because we have a course that you can
01:09 - check out
01:10 - our course is called profit with
01:12 - javascript and we've been able to help
01:13 - hundreds of students land their dream
01:15 - job as a software developer so if you
01:18 - want to be the next success store if you
01:20 - want to get your next job and you need
01:21 - to build that technical skill set
01:23 - click the link below and check out our
01:25 - course now with that being said
01:27 - let's jump right into it
01:32 - so here in the top 15 it's ordered from
01:34 - the least to the greatest
01:36 - and it starts off with systems engineers
01:39 - at a national
01:40 - average of one hundred and two thousand
01:43 - dollars
01:43 - per year so what exactly is a systems
01:46 - engineer
01:47 - a systems engineer you could think about
01:48 - kind of like the person who's in between
01:50 - the hardware and the software
01:52 - right so they're in charge of making
01:54 - sure that the system
01:55 - as a whole is gonna work properly that
01:57 - you have your hardware
01:58 - your databases your server set up
02:00 - properly and you have your software
02:02 - being able to talk to it in the right
02:04 - manner
02:04 - so systems engineering is actually very
02:06 - interesting because it can be applied
02:08 - to a lot of different fields
02:10 - specifically the cases that i gave
02:12 - was for the software related field but
02:14 - there's also systems
02:15 - engineers that have built out different
02:17 - systems in different fields such as
02:19 - the mechanical engineering world the
02:20 - aerospace world and just any
02:22 - other engineering field as well so next
02:24 - if we look here we have an it
02:26 - security specialist making about a
02:29 - hundred and six
02:30 - thousand dollars per year now the
02:32 - security specialist
02:34 - their main focus is to make sure that
02:36 - the mainframe security is on point
02:39 - because we wouldn't want any type of
02:40 - hackers
02:41 - any type of people trying to get the
02:43 - data that the company has
02:44 - about their specific products think of
02:46 - this way if the company was storing
02:47 - proprietary information inside their
02:49 - databases
02:50 - you wouldn't want anyone to have access
02:52 - to that information because if they knew
02:54 - what the databases looked like if they
02:55 - knew what the information looked like
02:57 - you would be able to hack the
02:58 - information that maybe even
02:59 - erase it and it would be detrimental to
03:01 - the company
03:02 - so an i.t security specialist make sure
03:05 - that
03:06 - the it system inside the business is
03:08 - secure
03:09 - and it won't be hacked so guys before we
03:12 - go any further into these
03:14 - amazing top 15 jobs i want to tell you
03:16 - about our sponsor for today
03:18 - hostinger as a software developer you're
03:20 - probably going to come across
03:22 - developing your own sites your own
03:23 - portfolio to put your projects or
03:25 - developing projects for your clients now
03:28 - hostinger
03:29 - is the perfect platform to be able to
03:31 - host
03:32 - and build your websites they make it
03:34 - super easy to use super easy to
03:36 - integrate
03:37 - they have an amazing user experience
03:40 - they even integrate with other apps to
03:42 - be able to build these websites with so
03:43 - much ease and it's just
03:45 - beautiful if you want to learn more
03:47 - about hosting your on how you can host
03:49 - your website or buy your domain
03:51 - click the link below to get seven
03:52 - percent off your yearly
03:54 - hosting plan this is the ideal platform
03:57 - for any
03:57 - website developer now with that being
03:59 - said let's get back
04:01 - into it so next if we scroll down to
04:03 - number three this is the one
04:05 - that basically everyone is familiar with
04:07 - which is software engineer so the
04:09 - software engineers make on average about
04:11 - a hundred and nine
04:12 - thousand dollars according to indeed and
04:14 - the reason i say this is one of the more
04:16 - typical ones is because when you apply a
04:18 - big
04:18 - tech this is usually the the title that
04:20 - they give you if you go to google
04:22 - microsoft or amazon it will be the
04:24 - software engineer title
04:26 - it's more like of a generalist where
04:27 - you're just able to build out
04:29 - software applications that are required
04:31 - so if you fall under software
04:32 - engineering
04:33 - you could go from anywhere like the low
04:35 - level programming
04:36 - of the actual hardware to software to
04:39 - even the high level programming of maybe
04:40 - web applications
04:42 - this is a great starting point to start
04:44 - your software career
04:45 - because as a generalist you're gonna get
04:47 - to find what your niche is
04:48 - and what the specific things are that
04:50 - you love about being a software
04:52 - developer so next
04:53 - on this list coming in at number four we
04:56 - have the full
04:57 - stack developer making about a hundred
04:59 - and thirteen
05:00 - thousand dollars per year now if you've
05:02 - been following our channel
05:04 - for a while you understand that this is
05:06 - what we specialize in
05:08 - if you want to become a full stack
05:10 - developer and make an average of a
05:11 - hundred and thirteen
05:12 - thousand dollars a year click the link
05:15 - below
05:16 - so that you could take the best
05:18 - javascript course on this planet
05:20 - and move towards your dreams of becoming
05:22 - a full stack developer
05:24 - now you might be asking what exactly is
05:26 - a full stack developer a full stack
05:28 - developer
05:29 - is a software developer who can build a
05:31 - product
05:32 - end to end by end to end i mean they're
05:34 - able to build the front end
05:35 - which is the ui and making the
05:37 - application whether it's a web app or a
05:39 - mobile app
05:40 - look nice and the backend which is all
05:42 - of the databases and how the data is
05:44 - going to be stored
05:45 - if you're a full stack developer you're
05:46 - a very versatile developer
05:48 - and for that reason it's one of the
05:49 - highest paying jobs in the industry
05:52 - for entry-level positions not only that
05:54 - it's one of the most demanded
05:56 - and the funnest now coming in at number
05:59 - five
06:00 - we have a cloud engineer making about
06:02 - 121
06:03 - 000 per year so with the rise of aws
06:08 - and azure and all these companies
06:10 - demands for more
06:11 - cloud engineers this job has been more
06:13 - and more in demand
06:14 - over the years now i clearly remember
06:16 - when the word cloud
06:17 - first came up it was such a weird
06:20 - concept to me i just didn't understand
06:21 - what is this cloud in the sky that
06:23 - people are getting data from
06:24 - but these companies aws azure
06:28 - google all these big tech companies
06:30 - getting involved are showing that it is
06:32 - such
06:33 - an important tool to have it allows you
06:35 - to basically have collaborative
06:37 - efforts happening in one place it allows
06:40 - you to store data
06:41 - without having to have your own server
06:43 - or database it fundamentally solves
06:46 - so many business problems in this world
06:48 - that the technology just keeps growing
06:50 - and growing and because it is still a
06:52 - relatively new
06:53 - field it is in high demand that people
06:55 - are getting paid a lot to become cloud
06:57 - engineers
06:58 - now next at number six we have data
07:01 - scientists coming at around
07:02 - 121 000 a year now honestly just data
07:06 - scientist
07:07 - is the hot new thing right now it's sexy
07:10 - it's
07:11 - trending it's the new tick tock and the
07:13 - reason for this is because people are
07:15 - realizing
07:16 - that when they get data when they're
07:18 - able to go into a database and collect
07:20 - all these data
07:20 - you can learn from that you can
07:22 - understand from they could develop
07:23 - analytics and if you build the right
07:26 - models from that you can predict things
07:28 - you can allow machine learning to take
07:30 - into place you can allow
07:31 - artificial intelligence to be leveraged
07:34 - properly and now
07:35 - this allows people in the business world
07:38 - to make
07:38 - business decisions based off the data
07:41 - that they have
07:42 - so next at number seven we have mobile
07:44 - developers making about 125
07:47 - 000 per year now this one's actually the
07:50 - one that's very close to my heart
07:52 - because this is where my passion
07:53 - for developing came from i remember when
07:57 - i was sitting there in
07:58 - college and all i was doing my freshman
08:00 - year was playing flappy bird i was
08:01 - clicking that button just so that stupid
08:03 - bird could flap up and i would keep
08:04 - hitting
08:05 - the green pipes but most importantly i
08:07 - was just fascinated
08:09 - with how it even worked i was fascinated
08:11 - how some people were just able to get to
08:12 - level
08:13 - 100 by defying gravity and going through
08:16 - all the pipes
08:16 - and i wanted to learn how the code
08:18 - actually worked mobile development was
08:20 - one of the biggest things that motivated
08:22 - me towards
08:23 - becoming a developer i wanted to learn
08:25 - more about it that's when i started to
08:26 - take my first computer science class
08:28 - and it took me down this path so mobile
08:30 - development is simple
08:32 - how do you actually make a software
08:33 - application for your phone
08:35 - whether it's ios or android or even then
08:37 - cross platform if you leverage a tool
08:39 - like react native
08:40 - this field is blowing up because people
08:42 - are realizing that we're going mobile
08:44 - now in fact our
08:45 - phone is like an extension of us if you
08:47 - happen to leave your phone at home
08:49 - you're gonna feel like you forgot
08:50 - something and you can't focus the rest
08:52 - of the day
08:52 - so if you want to be part of that
08:54 - industry if you want to be part of the
08:56 - change because everything is now going
08:57 - mobile
08:58 - this is definitely a field you can
08:59 - consider for the next one we have number
09:01 - eight and i
09:02 - actually want to put it next with number
09:04 - nine so number eight we have
09:05 - development operations engineer coming
09:07 - at 127
09:08 - 000 per year and number nine we have a
09:10 - site reliability engineer coming in at
09:12 - 128
09:13 - 000 per year now the reason i personally
09:16 - want to combine them is because from my
09:18 - experience with blue origin was
09:21 - that these are basically the same thing
09:23 - so development operations engineer
09:25 - also called devops engineering and site
09:27 - reliability engineering also called
09:29 - sre engineering have to deal with making
09:31 - the processes
09:33 - of a regular software engineers work a
09:35 - lot easier in
09:36 - automating those things so similar to
09:38 - like how a software engineer
09:40 - built software to automate a regular
09:42 - person's job
09:43 - the sre and devops built software to
09:46 - automate the software engineers job so
09:49 - they make it easy
09:50 - and automate things so the software
09:52 - engineer just has to worry about
09:53 - writing code and they don't have to
09:55 - worry about all the pipelines that it
09:56 - has to pass
09:57 - all the testing that it has to do
09:59 - because all that is automated through
10:00 - scripts and through frameworks
10:02 - now here in this article they separate a
10:04 - little bit more by saying that devops is
10:05 - actually involved in the operations of
10:07 - creating the scripts
10:08 - while sre kind of is the intermediate
10:11 - between the devops and the software
10:12 - engineer
10:13 - but i personally would probably
10:14 - categorize them as just the same thing
10:16 - sorry if i offend anyone now next coming
10:18 - in at number 10
10:19 - we have data warehouse architect and
10:22 - they have a national average around 134
10:26 - 000 per year now data warehousing
10:29 - is such an important job and in fact
10:31 - this was the bulk of my work
10:34 - at blue origin so you could think of a
10:36 - data warehousing architect
10:37 - like the person who plans a database so
10:40 - that you could just throw in
10:41 - a bunch of data and they'll neatly
10:43 - organize and stack everything where it's
10:45 - supposed to go
10:46 - so that someone can ask for that data on
10:48 - the other side and get it in a clean
10:50 - manner so data warehousing is super
10:52 - important because if it is done right
10:54 - it will allow all the other types of
10:56 - software developments whether it's
10:57 - full stack to data scientists it will
11:00 - allow all of them to have such an easier
11:02 - job by getting the data
11:03 - in a simple and easy to use manner so
11:06 - now coming in
11:07 - at number 11 we have the software
11:09 - architect making about 138
11:12 - thousand 000 per year so the software
11:16 - architect
11:16 - is responsible for using their knowledge
11:19 - and their understanding
11:20 - and planning out how a system should be
11:22 - built what should be attached to it
11:24 - what sort of api should it have should
11:27 - it be a microservice type of system like
11:29 - what is the general architecture of this
11:32 - software system
11:33 - so that it can work and help every other
11:35 - party that's going to use it
11:36 - in the most efficient manner by
11:38 - designing and thinking and architecting
11:41 - the software system in a specific way
11:44 - you're going to save the company
11:45 - a lot of headaches in the future so
11:47 - there's an important concept here that's
11:49 - called
11:49 - design for change if you have a design
11:52 - that is adaptable to future
11:54 - changes then it's going to be robust and
11:56 - it's not going to break down whenever
11:58 - something new is introduced to this
11:59 - and this is an important topic in terms
12:01 - of software architect that they have to
12:03 - keep in mind
12:04 - so they could build a robust system now
12:06 - coming in
12:07 - at number 12 we have the enterprise
12:09 - architect
12:10 - making about 140 000
12:14 - per year now the enterprise architect is
12:16 - very similar to the software architect
12:18 - in regards that they have to think about
12:20 - the design and how it's going to be
12:22 - implemented but the enterprise architect
12:25 - is a level up higher
12:27 - instead of just focusing on a specific
12:29 - software solution
12:30 - the enterprise architect is gonna focus
12:32 - on different
12:33 - software solutions and how they're all
12:35 - gonna come into play so inside of big
12:38 - companies
12:38 - enterprise architects usually design how
12:41 - all these internal tools are gonna
12:44 - interact with each other
12:45 - to make sure that they are effective and
12:48 - that they are really usable inside of
12:50 - the company now coming in at number
12:52 - 13 you're going to notice we're going to
12:53 - switch a little more from the
12:54 - development
12:55 - to the more people skills but we have a
12:57 - software engineering manager making
12:58 - around 144
13:00 - 000 per year so these managers make sure
13:04 - they use their expertise to be able to
13:06 - guide
13:06 - and lead a team of developers software
13:09 - engineering managers are usually
13:11 - entrusted
13:12 - with the couple projects of problems
13:14 - that they have to solve and they have
13:15 - maybe a handful of developers
13:17 - who are going to help them to solve that
13:18 - problem so you need a lot of people
13:21 - skills a lot of communication skills
13:22 - to make sure that both the customers and
13:24 - your developers are happy
13:26 - and not only that to make sure that
13:27 - they're developing the right thing for
13:29 - your customers
13:30 - so if you like the technical side of it
13:32 - but you also like to talk to people you
13:34 - also like to solve the problems
13:36 - this might be a good place for you now
13:38 - next coming in at number 14 we have the
13:40 - technical
13:40 - program manager making about 145
13:44 - 000 per year on average now in different
13:47 - companies
13:47 - the software engineering manager and the
13:49 - technical program manager
13:50 - tend to work at the same level but they
13:53 - have different responsibilities
13:54 - so depending on the company the software
13:56 - engineering manager and the technical
13:58 - program manager
13:59 - may have different responsibilities you
14:01 - could usually think
14:02 - as a software engineering manager the
14:04 - one who knows a little bit more about
14:05 - technology
14:06 - can relate to the developers that he's
14:09 - managing
14:10 - and can also talk in terms of how
14:12 - they're going to develop these next and
14:14 - coming features or fixed bugs well the
14:16 - technical program manager is one of the
14:18 - business side of things
14:19 - they're going to develop the budget
14:20 - they're going to develop the timeline
14:22 - and the time frame for building out the
14:23 - software application and they're going
14:25 - to be in charge of talking to the
14:26 - customers to make sure that everyone's
14:28 - happy and everyone's on the right path
14:30 - and finally the big one that we've all
14:32 - been waiting for
14:33 - number 15 the chief technology
14:36 - officer or the cto making an average of
14:39 - 157 dollars
14:41 - per year making an average of 157
14:45 - 000 per year now
14:48 - the cto this is the head honcho
14:51 - he is part of the executives inside of
14:53 - business this is the person who is
14:55 - overseeing
14:56 - all of the technology departments inside
14:59 - of a business
15:00 - he has to make sure that they're running
15:02 - like actual businesses with profits and
15:04 - loss
15:04 - he has to make sure that they're all
15:06 - communicating properly he has to make
15:07 - sure that the right
15:08 - systems are set up in place so that the
15:11 - company
15:12 - can be successful and the technologies
15:14 - will all work together
15:16 - without a cto you're gonna see a company
15:18 - struggle to have cohesion
15:20 - within the different software teams so
15:22 - if you're looking to climb up the
15:23 - corporate ladder
15:24 - this is the top position that you want
15:26 - to aim for so
15:28 - guys that is it you got to see the top
15:30 - 15 ping
15:31 - developer jobs in software go ahead and
15:34 - hit that like button
15:35 - so we could push this out to more people
