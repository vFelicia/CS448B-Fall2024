02:34 - take your skills to Hell Fire Bas the
02:37 - back in keep the data tight but there's
02:39 - more to learn the future right jack GPT
02:42 - and cl 3 lm's On The Rise got to master

03:35 - low code invest your time that's the
03:38 - profitable mod javasript react next
03:42 - Chasing Fire Bas llm L
03:52 - chain all right I got another one too
03:54 - for you guys and I want you to let me
03:57 - know if you like the the new one I'll
03:59 - play for if you like that one more so
04:01 - this was this this one is called road
04:03 - map to fullsack developer the one I just
04:05 - played it's on Spotify so you guys can
04:08 - check it out but I'll play another one
04:09 - for you guys this is a new one that I
04:12 - made
04:14 - um and just hear
04:22 - it
04:25 - fixing in
04:28 - [Music]
04:30 - no time for
04:31 - play most of my day
04:34 - [Music]
04:48 - searching this
04:50 - isue
04:53 - my but they don't understand this is my
04:57 - passion I'm taking a stand be to I'll
05:01 - go this is my life and I'll never
05:05 - stop no matter
05:13 - the yeah that one you guys like this one
05:16 - too somebody said it's a banger bro Bo
05:19 - boboho chat yeah I like that one too
05:24 - yeah basically what I want to do is I'm
05:25 - having these like coding sessions and
05:27 - I'm just kind of alone and sometimes I
05:28 - want to hang out with you guys holy [ __ ]
05:32 - yeah it's like so late here that it's
05:33 - literally the lights are turning off I
05:35 - got to go turn the lights
05:45 - on so basically what I want to start
05:47 - doing is just like start hanging out
05:50 - here with you guys as I as I do coding
05:52 - sessions I mean okay Kenny if you're in
05:55 - UK yes it's a morning for you but for me
05:57 - in U San Francisco it's like like 2
06:03 - a.m. um the these are like like separate
06:08 - screens you know this here and this here
06:10 - they latch on so then I get like three
06:13 - screens pretty much anywhere I go so
06:15 - it's like kind of like
06:18 - this um so yeah it's a setup that I I
06:21 - think it's pretty cool and I I like
06:24 - it
06:26 - um but yeah basically I want to start
06:28 - hanging out with you guys in coding
06:30 - sometimes at like you know cuz I'm
06:32 - coding 10 12 hours a day I'm building a
06:34 - product with my co-founder Nas and we're
06:38 - building a new products called poppy Ai
06:41 - and we're going to be launching this and
06:42 - essentially the idea behind poppy AI
06:48 - is visualizing note taking and turning
06:52 - that
06:53 - into output like written output so
06:57 - imagine mirror board which is a
06:58 - Whiteboard app
07:00 - and Google doc or notion had a baby
07:02 - together and so we're building that and
07:04 - we'll see if it's going to stick with
07:06 - people or not but so far poppy AI for
07:08 - example can allow you to talk to YouTube
07:10 - videos and make notes out of that talk
07:12 - to voice notes and make note out of that
07:15 - it will soon be able to talk to images
07:18 - and make notes out of it and what we're
07:20 - trying to do is make mind maps out of it
07:23 - and so it allows you to think and turn
07:25 - all your messy thoughts on the left hand
07:27 - side and turn it into something that
07:29 - actually right on the right hand side
07:30 - it's not a pitch for the product by the
07:31 - way so I'll shut up uh that's not my
07:34 - point I'm like literally just coding it
07:36 - building it and it's not even publicly
07:38 - available or anything yet we're like
07:39 - building it right now I'll answer you
07:41 - guys' questions too as they come
07:46 - along um is is web 3 actually worth it
07:49 - to learn instead of AI learn what what
07:52 - brings you passion like for me AI brings
07:54 - me a lot of passion and excitement so
07:57 - learn learn web 3 if you enjoy
08:02 - poppy AI ads come on your YouTube how I
08:05 - don't have any ads I haven't been
08:06 - running any paid ads
08:14 - yet I'm doing coding for fun for myself
08:17 - but also I'm building a company a
08:20 - startup and so for that I have to be
08:22 - sitting here and coding um and I'm
08:25 - literally coding every day for 10 to 12
08:27 - hours a day I mean again right now show
08:29 - you my Apple
08:37 - watch you know if I show you my Apple
08:40 - watch
08:41 - which is really annoying because it just
08:44 - never wants to show itself but yeah if
08:47 - you can read that it says 1:21 a.m. um
08:51 - and you know I've been sitting here this
08:53 - desk probably since 12:00
08:57 - p.m. um
09:01 - 13 hours
09:03 - today and similar yesterday and the day
09:05 - before
09:07 - that and yeah I just get bored not no no
09:10 - [ __ ] that it's the opposite of what I
09:12 - meant to say I I am I enjoy it so much
09:16 - but what I miss is having somebody
09:18 - around me sometimes cuz I'm like just
09:20 - coding and so I'd like to brainstorm or
09:22 - I'd like
09:22 - to you know maybe just give you Vibes
09:25 - while you're coding too you know almost
09:27 - a co-working um
09:30 - together and it's just fun to be able to
09:32 - chat with you guys as I code so I'm
09:34 - thinking to start doing this where I
09:35 - just like go live just code play some
09:39 - music you know and then you guys can
09:41 - just code along with
09:43 - me um and then yeah we interact in the
09:47 - meantime so that would be a lot of
09:55 - fun best AI course I mean there's a lot
09:58 - I have course called profit with the ey
10:00 - which is an incredible course so you can
10:03 - check that
10:07 - out please update the code for the
10:12 - challenge yeah xity for sure like just
10:16 - open up your laptop start coding and
10:18 - I'll be coding right here so we're
10:20 - pretty much coding together then you
10:21 - know you can just chat in here and let
10:23 - me know how's how the your code is going
10:25 - how it's working and all that that'd be
10:27 - dope
10:30 - yeah python is pretty good
10:42 - for I'll link you the profit with the ey
10:45 - course I just linked it to
10:47 - you um and you can check that out Naas
10:50 - is not doing that much web 3 right now
11:08 - so I'm going to be going in between like
11:10 - hanging out with you guys and then
11:12 - coding so I'll probably go back into
11:13 - coding I'm like learning about nextjs
11:16 - server side actions they're pretty
11:18 - freaking awesome and I haven't really
11:20 - ever used them that much but they're so
11:22 - much better than doing your traditional
11:25 - API routing so I'm looking that up and
11:28 - just having some much fun with that so
11:30 - I'm going to go back into that and then
11:33 - I'll interact with you guys too at
11:35 - random points but in the meantime just
11:37 - hang out enjoy the music it'll be a
11:44 - Vibe mod months of practice that's what
11:47 - it's going to take building app with AI
11:50 - That's the path to make qu a let a job
11:52 - in the tech industry got to stay ahead
11:55 - with the latest technology join my
11:58 - course profit with they I chat JT learn
12:01 - it fast build practical you see the
12:03 - future here it's moving real quick adap
12:07 - get left behind this is the new trick
12:10 - road map to success in 20204 a full
12:13 - stack developer with AI at your core
12:16 - Lane chain for control so for the low
12:19 - colde and that's your time in AI That's
12:22 - the profitable mod javasript react next
12:25 - J Fire base llm SL chain more
12:41 - enger L up I got a ro for you want to be

12:48 - 2024 yeah javascript's the foundation
12:51 - you got to know it well reacting nextjs
12:54 - they'll take the SKS to Hell Fire base
12:57 - for the back in keep the data TY but
12:59 - there's more to learn the future right
13:02 - Jack jpt and clock three LM On The Rise
13:06 - got to master the pr engineering that's
13:08 - where the power lies road map to success
13:11 - in 2024 full stack developer with AI Lan
13:16 - chain for control the wi for the low Cod
13:19 - invest your time in that's the
13:21 - profitable mode of practice that's what
13:24 - it's going to take building apps with AI
13:27 - That's the path to make qu land job in

13:41 - it's moving real quick adapter getting
13:44 - left behind this is the new trick road
13:47 - map to success in 2024 full St developer
13:52 - with a ex cor Lane chain for control so
13:55 - wi for the low cold invest your time in
13:58 - here that's profitable mode javasript
14:01 - react next Jing fire Bas LM SL chain for
14:06 - more
14:10 - enger
14:17 - [Music]
14:18 - follow listen up I got a for you to be a
14:23 - full stack
14:25 - de24 yeah javascripts the foundation you
14:28 - got know it well reacting nextjs they'll
14:32 - take the skills to Hell Fire Bas for the
14:34 - back and keep your data tight but this
14:37 - more to learn the future right Jack and
14:40 - cl LM on the got
14:44 - master so I'll I'll keep sharing any new
14:47 - things that I'm learning with you guys
14:49 - so one of the things that I've picked
14:52 - up just now
14:55 - is getting structured responses from an
14:58 - llm
15:00 - and that's been fascinating cuz I mean I
15:04 - used to do that and I used to kind of
15:06 - force my llms to respond with the Json
15:09 - and I would do it in a hacky way where I
15:11 - would just do a lot of prompt
15:12 - engineering and stuff like that but now
15:14 - I'm learning ways to do that where you
15:16 - could programmatically force it to be in
15:19 - that structure and return it always
15:22 - returns a Json
15:24 - response it's really
15:27 - powerful um how that works and cell has
15:29 - SDK for it and there is a typescript
15:32 - first validation schema called sod and
15:36 - that allows you to do that and enforce
15:38 - it basically it's so yeah it's just
15:42 - really cool cuz you
15:45 - get you get your data back in Json which
15:48 - is exactly usually how you want it um
15:53 - instead
15:54 - of getting it just as a strength cuz
15:56 - then you can't do much with it so I wish
15:59 - I could share my screen and show you
16:00 - guys more uh which I will in the future
16:03 - but for now
16:06 - just enjoy learning from my
16:11 - words
16:15 - um my MacBook
16:18 - specifications I forget but it's a
16:20 - pretty souped up MacBook it's like 45k
16:23 - or 6K I don't know how much I paid for
16:24 - it but it's pretty souped up so it's
16:27 - like I'll here let me just try to tell
16:30 - it to you CU I always forget my
16:34 - specs um M2 so not an M M3 but M2 max
16:39 - memory is 96 gigs so that's what I'm
16:43 - rocking
16:46 - um web 3 content probably not anytime
16:49 - soon it would recommend for me and yes
16:52 - silic can chips is what I have
16:59 - this is the
17:54 - thanks for looking out for me for
17:56 - helping me improve my posture
17:59 - yes see this is what I need this what I
18:01 - need you guys here with me I need your
18:04 - help I got to fix my posture here this
18:07 - will force my posture to be
18:13 - better but no I don't get neck pain dude
18:15 - I'll sit like that for
18:25 - eternity yeah water damn that's true
18:37 - no I don't have anything in my bag I'll
18:39 - just have to be thirsty for now
19:04 - I'll put the chat on the right hand
19:08 - side is there a way I can pop chat
19:17 - up pop out chat there we go
19:51 - yeah this is a co-working space that I'm
19:53 - at right now
20:01 - not from
20:08 - home man I'm loving this like I'm I'm
20:12 - just so excited I'm learning about
20:13 - server reactions and I'm like this is
20:15 - going to be so cool once I really figure
20:17 - it out inside
20:20 - out okay let's see how this
20:24 - is like this is what I'm studying right
20:26 - now I'll just drop the link in the chat
20:27 - but this is what this is the docs I
20:29 - dropped in the link the description or
20:31 - in the chat that's just what I'm looking
20:33 - up and learning and playing around with
20:36 - right now
21:13 - I want to live stream my
21:16 - screen
21:21 - scar f
21:48 - so I'm asking Claude because I live
21:51 - stream I want to live stream and I want
21:52 - to share my coding screen but I get
21:54 - scared sometimes cuz I don't want to
21:55 - reveal any end keys and I'm this is a
21:57 - real project right this is not a dummy
22:00 - project I'm doing for YouTube or just
22:02 - like a fun project for YouTube and
22:04 - teaching purposes and I'm asking if I
22:07 - can make it where in Visual Studio code
22:10 - n files just do not show like even if I
22:14 - by by mistake like open it it just never
22:18 - shows and I'm wondering if I can make a
22:20 - script or write a script or something
22:21 - like that that would be really cool so
22:23 - I'm just talking to Chad GPT and asking
22:26 - asking about
22:27 - that
22:57 - for for
23:33 - oh I can do that there's something
23:36 - called
23:40 - exclude
23:42 - nice
23:45 - okay that's cool
24:03 - don't and if I do
24:06 - that yep it hides
24:10 - it okay and then if i n.
24:15 - n but does my stuff still
24:23 - work it it does
24:31 - whoa that's freaking cool okay so that
24:35 - means that if I have all my
24:37 - ends inside here then even on a live
24:40 - stream I don't have to worry about my
24:42 - keys being shown cuzz they will just be
24:45 - I won't even be able to open those files
24:48 - so that's great they'll just hide it
24:49 - from the file explorer that's really
24:51 - good to know I wish I knew this before I
24:54 - did so many
24:55 - streams and then I just have to mentally
24:57 - remember to not show end
25:08 - files I need a lifter screen ooh posture
25:12 - again yeah you're right damn how do I
25:16 - remember this
25:17 - [ __ ] I constantly keep forgetting cuz
25:20 - when I get like sucked into
25:26 - it perfect posture
25:34 - damn but now I'm too far so like now I
25:37 - can't read [ __ ] and I got to get closer
25:40 - to
25:44 - read oh yeah yeah I have the lifter I'll
25:49 - bring that you're right I'll bring that
25:50 - tomorrow
26:27 - IND

60:03 - learned a lot pushed shipped a lot of
60:06 - features probably a week from now this
60:08 - SAS product will go
60:10 - live and we will start to have initial
60:13 - people starting to use it which will be
60:14 - very
60:16 - exciting but yeah I would love to do
60:19 - this again with you guys if you would be
60:21 - down and uh maybe come along and code
60:24 - with me open up your laptops and let's
60:26 - start building stuff I'd love to build a
60:28 - community of people who are building
60:31 - things and developing apps and that
60:34 - would be a lot of fun to
60:36 - do uh kidra says I'm down yeah that'd be
60:39 - awesome like come on down next time and
60:41 - just you know let's just all code
60:44 - together that's the idea so you know
60:47 - basically my goal is to create almost
60:49 - like a co-working environment but just
60:52 - online so
60:54 - live and
60:57 - yeah you know hopefully we build stuff
61:00 - and we can even do something where we
61:01 - hold each other accountable and we set
61:03 - like onewe goal and so you know if
61:06 - you're here you want to build something
61:08 - you set a onee goal of like this is what
61:09 - I want to build this is how far I want
61:10 - to get and then I hold you accountable
61:12 - and we in the community hold you
61:14 - accountable and then I'll do similar
61:17 - where I'll set a goal and you guys hold
61:18 - me accountable to that and so and then
61:21 - we can have weekly Sprints so that would
61:23 - be something super fun to do
61:26 - but yeah I just thought today to just go
61:28 - live and code so I did it was fun but
61:33 - I'm going to call it a night and I'll
61:34 - see you guys
61:38 - soon by the way hit me up if any of you
61:40 - guys want to be a part of this hit me up
