00:00 - - Hey you, in this video
I'm gonna be showing you
00:03 - the top four programming
languages to learn in 2019
00:08 - to get a job without a college degree.
00:11 - The way that I've ranked these languages,
00:13 - just like my last video.
00:15 - They're based on three things:
00:17 - Number one.
00:19 - The time it takes even
an absolute beginner
00:22 - to go from complete zero
and ultimately getting a job
00:27 - without needing a college degree.
00:29 - Number two, the job market.
00:32 - Now this is the most
important one you guys,
00:34 - this is what you're here for, the salary,
00:38 - how much money are you making.
00:41 - And number three, productivity.
00:46 - How fast can you go from
conception of an idea
00:49 - to a completely coded application
00:52 - that another person can use.
00:54 - Lastly, I'll be showing you
00:56 - the Conor McGregor and the Khabib
00:59 - of the programming languages.
01:01 - Oh, by the way, I have
a picture with Khabib.
01:04 - And I'll also reveal to you
the programming language
01:08 - that has officially been Googled
more than Kim Kardashian.
01:12 - So without any further ado,
let's jump right into it.
01:17 - (intense music)
01:29 - This is Rafeh Qazi also
known as Papa Python
01:32 - from cleverprogrammer.com.
01:35 - Papa Python is officially
my brand new title.
01:39 - So, now we're going to cover
01:40 - the top four programming languages
01:42 - to learn in 2019 to get a job
01:45 - without needing a college degree.
01:47 - Number four, C++.
01:50 - I got a lotta heat for
not putting this one
01:52 - in my last video, so I decided
to put it in this video.
01:55 - Now, this programming
language is very powerful,
01:58 - people from software development
02:00 - all the way to game
development are using it.
02:03 - If you've ever heard of
the engine called Unity,
02:06 - that's using C++, and if
you can program in C++,
02:10 - you can also use Unity
to create awesome games.
02:13 - However, it's a difficult
programming language
02:16 - to get started with.
02:17 - It's kinda like if you
wanted to learn how to swim
02:20 - and your big brother just takes you
02:21 - and throws you in the ocean,
02:23 - and he's like, go figure it out.
02:25 - So C++, just to recap,
great programming language,
02:29 - great salary, not good to start off with.
02:33 - And the salary for C++, a $115,000 a year.
02:37 - Number three, Swift.
02:41 - Swift is a native iOS programming language
02:44 - used to create things in the App Store.
02:46 - So how freaking cool is that,
02:47 - imagine you are going through your iPhone
02:49 - and you go to the App Store,
and when you download stuff
02:52 - all of that is made using Swift.
02:54 - Swift also comes from the
C programming languages,
02:57 - so it came from Objective C,
02:59 - and then C++ happened and all that.
03:01 - So it's similar to C.
03:03 - Now if you know C++
03:05 - you're gonna be able to
learn Swift pretty quickly.
03:08 - Con for this is the same as C++,
03:11 - because it comes from the C family,
03:13 - it's naturally a lot
harder to start off with.
03:17 - If I'm using technical
terms, you wanna start off
03:20 - with the more dynamic programming
language, this is static,
03:24 - which makes it harder
to learn as a beginner.
03:28 - Now Swift is really good
for freelancing work,
03:31 - entrepreneurial work, if you
wanna build your own startup.
03:35 - And it's really good for
getting a full-time job.
03:38 - The average salary of a Swift developer
03:41 - is $110,000 per year,
according to indeed.com.
03:45 - Number two, JavaScript.
03:49 - Now, who I'm introducing you to,
03:52 - I like to call the Conor
McGregor of programing.
03:56 - How should I describe JavaScript?
03:58 - It's awesome, it's cool, it has style.
04:02 - It's super popular, it's at
the tip of everybody's tongue,
04:04 - it's always trending, it wears a nice suit
04:08 - and it's the most popular when
it comes to web development.
04:11 - Now, I'm gonna talk about,
04:12 - not such good sides of JavaScript.
04:15 - Like Conor McGregor, JavaScript
keeps changing a lot.
04:20 - So, Conor McGregor going to
boxing, coming back to UFC.
04:23 - JavaScript, it always has a
lotta new things coming out
04:27 - which completely changed its language.
04:29 - So if you're a beginner, yes
it's an easy language to learn.
04:32 - It's a lot easier to learn than Swift,
04:35 - it's a lot easier to learn than C++.
04:37 - But, there's so many ways
of doing the same thing
04:40 - that it can make you fall
into traps and confuse you.
04:44 - And like Conor McGregor, it has again,
04:46 - many new features and new
things coming into it, right?
04:49 - So for example, oh React is hot,
04:52 - or Node is hot.
04:54 - And new frameworks keep being added
04:56 - and new features to the
language keep being added
04:59 - and it's hard to become
really really good at it,
05:02 - especially when you're
just starting out, okay?
05:04 - So when you're starting out,
05:06 - you wanna do something that's simple,
05:08 - that works every time.
05:09 - And then you can come to the fun stuff,
05:11 - the hot and the exciting stuff.
05:13 - That's how I would describe JavaScript.
05:15 - Great Language, by the
way, and really really fun.
05:18 - I love it myself.
05:19 - The average salary for
a JavaScript developer
05:23 - is $110,000 per year.
05:26 - Now, moving on to the
05:28 - most powerful and amazing
programming language.
05:32 - Number one.
05:34 - (drum roll)
05:37 - Erlang.
05:39 - Did I trick you there?
05:40 - Because it's not Erlang, it's Python.
05:42 - Why is this the number
one programming language?
05:45 - Well, let me start my friend.
05:47 - This is the part that gets me excited,
05:49 - this is the part I made
this entire video for,
05:51 - just so I could talk about Python.
05:53 - It's officially been Googled
05:55 - more than Kim Kardashian in 2018.
05:58 - That should just be reason
enough, go start doing Python,
06:01 - just quit this video.
06:02 - The second reason, is that
it's kinda like Khabib.
06:05 - It's very relaxed, calm,
06:07 - doesn't talk about all
these new modules coming out
06:10 - and new frameworks coming out,
06:12 - but it can do all of the
heavy lifting that you need.
06:15 - Instagram is built with Python,
06:18 - YouTube is built with Python,
06:19 - Google is built with Python,
06:22 - Reddit is built with Python,
06:23 - Quora is built with Python,
06:25 - Hipmunk is built on Python,
06:27 - NASA runs on Python.
06:28 - And actually just two
days ago I was in Canada
06:31 - and I was at a D-Wave
quantum computing event
06:34 - with CS Dojo and Siraj Raval,
06:36 - and they revealed to us quantum computing.
06:38 - And guess what programming language
06:40 - the quantum computing people are using?
06:43 - Okay guys, I'm here with.
06:46 - - Moshino.
06:47 - And he works at D-Wave.
06:49 - What framework are you using?
06:51 - - (foreign language)
06:53 - - Boom!
06:54 - That's right, Python.
06:56 - Another thing that's very hot for Python
06:58 - is called data science.
07:01 - With data science,
Amazon uses data science
07:04 - to recommend to you stuff
07:05 - that you never even
thought that you needed.
07:07 - Netflix recommends you
movies, you're like,
07:10 - I didn't even know I
wanted to watch this movie
07:12 - and I watched it and
it's freaking awesome.
07:13 - When you use your phone and
it recognizes your face,
07:17 - whether you're laughing, crying, smiling,
07:19 - you have a weird face,
07:20 - that's using data science
and machine learning.
07:23 - And Python is very heavy
07:25 - on data science and machine learning.
07:27 - Those salaries go from like $100,000
07:30 - to something crazy like
two, 300 or even $400,000.
07:35 - Another thing I want you
to know about Python is,
07:37 - it's the fastest-growing
programming language.
07:40 - So it has beat out other
programming languages like PHP.
07:44 - It's also the most wanted
programming language
07:48 - according to the Stack
Overflow 2018 survey.
07:52 - And it's on its way to become
07:54 - the most popular programming
language in the world.
07:57 - Oh, and one important thing
that I did not mention,
08:01 - it's the best one to start off with,
08:03 - especially if you're a beginner.
08:05 - The learning curve is almost none,
08:08 - you can run it even online,
08:11 - and you can start building things with it
08:13 - very very very quickly.
08:15 - So, in my mind, if you could
start off with something simple
08:20 - and built things that's really powerful.
08:22 - And it's future-proof,
08:23 - so you can be using it for years to come.
08:25 - Let's say even if you want to learn
08:27 - programming languages like C++.
08:29 - Because let's say you wanna
become a Unity game developer,
08:31 - I totally understand.
08:33 - Or let's say you wanna learn Swift
08:35 - because you want to develop iOS apps,
08:37 - or maybe you wanna learn JavaScript
08:39 - 'cause it's kind of like Conor McGregor
08:42 - and maybe you like Conor McGregor
08:43 - and you like nice suits
and nice frameworks,
08:46 - that's totally okay too.
08:47 - If you start off with Python,
08:50 - you can very quickly and easily
08:53 - jump to JavaScript and learn it,
08:55 - jump to C++ and learn it
08:57 - or jump to Swift and learn it.
08:59 - So I want you to start off with
Python if you're a beginner.
09:03 - With that said, Python
average salary for developers
09:07 - is a $116,000 a year.
09:12 - Now, I would like to show you
the salary for all of these.
09:16 - So here is the salary for
09:19 - C++ developer,
09:22 - a Swift developer,
09:23 - a JavaScript developer
09:26 - and a Python developer.
09:29 - Everybody makes really good money.
09:31 - What's most important to understand is
09:34 - which of these falls in line
09:37 - with your ultimate vision
and your ultimate plan?
09:40 - Look if this video helped you
09:42 - and you want to dive in
and go a little bit deeper,
09:46 - I have a three-part epic masterclass,
09:50 - it's un-freaking-believable
and it will blow your mind.
09:55 - There's a three-part master class
09:56 - along with an exclusive training.
09:59 - All of these are
completely free of charge.
10:03 - So in this, I wanna show you
how you can be on your path
10:06 - to start becoming a six-figure developer.
10:09 - I also show you the
different job opportunities
10:13 - that exist in the market,
10:15 - and I lay down the specific
path for you to go from...
10:20 - Maybe if you're a beginner
right now, all the way to,
10:23 - how can you get freelancing clients
10:26 - or get a full-time job or maybe
even build your own startup.
10:31 - I lay down the entire foundation,
10:33 - I put down this three epic
part training, completely free.
10:37 - It's in the description
below in the YouTube video,
10:40 - if you're watching it on
YouTube just click the link.
10:43 - I want you to go to that master class,
10:45 - just put in your email
10:47 - and it will send you all those videos.
10:50 - All right my friend, that is it,
10:52 - that is all I have for you today.
10:54 - Thank you so much for watching this.
10:57 - I love you, I appreciate
your beautiful face.
11:00 - That's it.
11:01 - And I'll see you in the next video.
11:04 - (intense music)
