00:00 - hey you what's up this is Kazi from
00:02 - clever programmer calm so for the last
00:05 - few days I have been at chest state
00:07 - championships coaching the announced
00:09 - North High School chess team I used to
00:11 - play on that chess team in 2000 2009 to
00:15 - 2012 and I ended up winning two state
00:18 - championships during my high school
00:19 - career but I wanted to now kind of
00:23 - return the favor and coach the team
00:24 - because that's something I absolutely
00:26 - love to do and absolutely love to play
00:28 - chess so this video is gonna be a little
00:31 - bit about chess so let's jump right into
00:35 - it
00:41 - so to keep it relevant for you guys I'm
00:43 - gonna start off with one of my students
00:45 - asking me a computer science question
00:47 - that's related to high school and then
00:51 - transitioning over to a career so I'm
00:55 - gonna have him ask me that question and
00:56 - then I'm gonna answer it because I want
00:58 - to keep this relevant to you guys as
01:00 - well here we go my question is in order
01:02 - I am a high school student and in order
01:05 - for me to get a head start in the field
01:08 - of Technology and computer science I was
01:10 - wondering what I could do to get ahead
01:14 - in the field and learn the technical
01:16 - skills needed to get a job or an
01:19 - internship at a company how would I
01:22 - would actually answer that question is
01:24 - that work on soft skills more than you
01:27 - actually work on technical skills so yes
01:29 - improve your technical skills focus on
01:32 - them but I want you to work really hard
01:35 - on your negotiation skills and your
01:38 - tactical skills in your interviewing
01:39 - skills a lot of software developers just
01:41 - hope and pray that if they are good
01:44 - enough good jobs will just land on them
01:46 - and that doesn't happen and that doesn't
01:48 - happen with standardized testing either
01:49 - a CTS
01:51 - how do you score well on your high
01:52 - school a CT which is the standard test
01:56 - that you get in junior year of high
01:58 - school is
02:00 - you start actually taking literally the
02:02 - test and get good at taking the test
02:04 - so with getting a better job you have to
02:08 - get good at actually looking for jobs
02:10 - and interviewing for the jobs so that
02:12 - would be my answer work on soft skills
02:14 - work a lot on negotiation skills all
02:19 - right let me give you a little bit of a
02:21 - backstory here the the chess tournament
02:23 - that we had which was going to the state
02:25 - chess championships we kind of left on
02:28 - Thursday like really early in the
02:31 - morning like 6 7 a.m. and then we got on
02:43 - the van and then we'd roll like I was
02:46 - driving the team and then my other coach
02:48 - was there too and we got in we settled
02:51 - in around on Thursday yes and the
03:04 - tournament is a two-day tournament so
03:05 - the tournament took place on Friday and
03:07 - then the tournament also took place on
03:09 - Saturday so it's a two-day tournament
03:11 - there are seven total rounds and there
03:14 - were a hundred and forty nine teams
03:16 - there so depending on how how many games
03:19 - you want that's how you kind of got your
03:21 - ranking so in the chess tournament on at
03:25 - the state championships level with
03:27 - schools how it works is there's a eight
03:28 - board team so eight of your people
03:30 - announce north to go around playing
03:32 - against other eight player teams and if
03:34 - the noun or team members wins then you
03:37 - know that that makes us go to the next
03:39 - round with a good result our ultimate
03:42 - score at the end was five wins and two
03:45 - losses which puts us as the 27th best
03:49 - team in the entire state which you know
03:53 - may be good for some teams but for now
03:56 - north historically we haven't done like
04:00 - this in the last 20 years we have scored
04:02 - higher but our team did actually a lot
04:07 - better than we had expected because we
04:09 - have lots of new players who are
04:11 - inexperienced and
04:12 - these guys these students these kids are
04:16 - crazy like as a team they pulled through
04:18 - they were doing really well they were
04:19 - taking so many teams asses like out of
04:21 - nowhere we were thinking that we're
04:23 - gonna get only three wins or four wins
04:24 - and I'm gonna show you a little bit in
04:27 - the snapchat stories with you - the
04:29 - quality is not that good but I think
04:31 - that you're gonna watch it and you
04:34 - you'll enjoy it and if you enjoyed it
04:36 - you know just comment below okay that
04:38 - was pretty cool and also like the video
04:40 - because I want to make sure that this
04:42 - video gets out to more people because
04:44 - remember the notification systems of the
04:46 - YouTube are completely like kind of
04:48 - broken right now so these videos aren't
04:49 - going out to everybody like they're
04:51 - supposed to and when you do that it
04:53 - makes sure that it gets ranked higher
04:55 - and so more people are likely to see
04:57 - especially you know people like you
04:59 - we're watching this video right now as a
05:01 - matter of fact so let's do that in the
05:04 - video and that I'm gonna share with you
05:05 - you're gonna be seeing me play some
05:07 - chess and I'm gonna be playing with some
05:10 - of my students I'm gonna be playing with
05:11 - my former coach his name was Harry Caray
05:14 - Oz's and I learned a lot from them and
05:17 - honestly a lot of the skills that I've
05:19 - learned from chests have translated into
05:22 - my coding a problem-solving skills
05:25 - high like levels of patience and then
05:29 - being able to analyze positions because
05:32 - in chess you have to analyze each
05:34 - position and you have to calculate out
05:36 - moves that are kind of very deep so I
05:39 - hate when people make and random
05:41 - analogies and connected to chess I ask
05:43 - it's so annoying for me they like
05:45 - connect anything to chests oh it's just
05:47 - like chess
05:47 - oh you're just making the next move but
05:51 - you know in certain respects I think
05:54 - it's okay and here I think I can make
05:56 - that analogy because for me
05:58 - chess did help me become the person I am
06:01 - today honestly I wasn't a very good
06:04 - student my whole life in school and so
06:08 - becoming good at chess becoming top 1%
06:10 - in the world you know just by playing on
06:13 - high school team and then you know just
06:14 - doing a lot on my own like studying and
06:17 - working hard every day it allowed me to
06:19 - get skilled at something
06:23 - and then I attack it and then that
06:27 - translated into spilled over into other
06:30 - things like coding and programming so
06:31 - for you guys if you are doing something
06:34 - else like another sport you know don't
06:36 - just wait it to get into programming
06:37 - like keep up with other skill because
06:48 - you'll be surprised how many other
06:50 - things from your different skill set
06:52 - even if it's table tennis or pool or
06:55 - swimming or whatever else will transfer
06:58 - over into coding like a lot of
07:10 - sportsmanship I had in a lot of like
07:13 - this insane ability that had developed
07:16 - to never ever ever give up and just like
07:19 - if I was stuck on a chess puzzle I would
07:21 - be stuck on it for weeks I would not
07:23 - look at the answer and then for me
07:25 - encoding what that meant was I would be
07:26 - stuck on a coding problem for weeks and
07:28 - I would not look at an answer and also
07:30 - not quit because 99% of the people when
07:33 - they can't find an answer they quit and
07:44 - I would just keep going and keep on
07:46 - learning you think so I would recommend
07:48 - you have different skill sets and you'll
07:52 - be surprised by how much they'll help
07:54 - you also I want to take this moment to
07:58 - just quickly talk about depth of versus
08:00 - breadth okay or with focus on being
08:05 - depth first and everything in computer
08:07 - programming there is an algorithm for
08:08 - search and it's called depth-first
08:10 - search and I am a huge fan of that and I
08:12 - think you should live your life like
08:14 - that as well
08:15 - and what that means is instead of going
08:18 - inch wide you know for a mile you should
08:23 - go a mile deep and an inch wide okay so
08:26 - instead of learning 20 different
08:28 - languages and learning like little bit
08:30 - of every different language learn one
08:32 - language and learn it
08:33 - damn well learn all the concepts and
08:36 - everything involved inside of it hey
08:39 - Eric
08:39 - did you win against me guys seriously
08:47 - joking aside I want to give a big
08:49 - shout-out to Eric I've been working with
08:51 - Eric since he was in seventh grade and
08:53 - right now he's a junior in high school
08:55 - which puts him at 12th grade so our 11th
08:58 - grade she means he's been I've been
09:00 - coaching him for five years he's been
09:02 - able to do some tremendous things and I
09:05 - was incredibly proud of him at this
09:07 - tournament especially what he was able
09:09 - to accomplish the next part of the story
09:11 - is kind of dedicated to Eric so I really
09:14 - want you guys to watch this and also
09:16 - just you know give if you can give him a
09:18 - little appreciation in the comments
09:20 - below I'll show him and I'm sure it'll
09:21 - make his day okay guys this is the game
09:24 - break around the last round there's only
09:28 - one person playing on our team
09:30 - if he wins our team win explanation eric
09:34 - is playing this is the last round
09:36 - if he wins our team wins if he draws our
09:37 - team draws and if he loses our team
09:39 - loses this is super dramatic we are
09:42 - about to walk in right now
09:49 - [Music]
09:53 - so tournament rooms are dead quiet so
09:56 - what I'm gonna try to do is provide a
09:58 - little commentary here for you guys so
10:00 - here you're watching that Eric needs to
10:03 - win this round the other seven members
10:05 - on our team at Niles North some of them
10:08 - lost some of them want but ultimately it
10:10 - came down to Eric
10:11 - in chess you can either win by your
10:13 - clock hitting zero or you lose if your
10:16 - clock hits zero or you can checkmate the
10:19 - other person so that's how it works in
10:20 - real professional chess tournaments so
10:23 - Eric is kind of thinking here and he's
10:25 - trying to win he has a much better
10:27 - position also I forgot to mention that
10:29 - he's playing on board one which is the
10:32 - most difficult board to play on board
10:34 - eight is the lowest rated and board one
10:37 - is two highest rated and he had about
10:40 - twenty or thirty people crowded around
10:42 - him watching his game near the end so he
10:44 - has a tremendous amount of pressure here
10:46 - but ultimately Eric was able to break
10:49 - through and win the game like this was a
10:52 - tremendous moment for nows north and it
10:54 - was able to pull Niles north through to
10:56 - the next round and then play in the
10:59 - final round so ultimately our team ended
11:01 - up doing well everybody played well
11:03 - together I was extremely proud of
11:05 - everybody and here just some goofs and
11:06 - gaps for you guys to enjoy because we
11:08 - are just
11:15 - [Music]
11:32 - what feature does Android have that
11:34 - iPhone doesn't give us an example that's
11:38 - right for a sport or for another hobby
11:44 - that you have get really good at one
11:47 - thing and then move on to different
11:48 - things like become really deeply skilled
11:51 - because nobody cares about just these
11:54 - generalists like people want to work
11:56 - with specialists so I would highly
11:58 - recommend becoming a specialist and kind
12:00 - of everything that you get yourself into
12:02 - like really get a deep knowledge of it
12:05 - and then you can take a step back and
12:07 - then try to develop some soft skills
12:08 - around it for me what that meant was
12:11 - getting programming skills and then
12:13 - working on my negotiation and soft
12:14 - skills thank you guys for watching so
12:16 - much if you like the video please hit
12:18 - that like button subscribe to the
12:20 - channel and go ahead check out some of
12:23 - my other videos that should be popping
