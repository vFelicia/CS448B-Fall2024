06:15 - going so let's get started with today's
06:18 - training okay and what we're going to be
06:20 - doing so
06:21 - let's start off with this this is
06:23 - according to glassdoor
06:25 - here is an average front-end developer
06:27 - salary okay an average front-end
06:29 - developer makes 87 000 a year who here
06:33 - would like to be making 87 000 a year
06:37 - yeah i mean that that's not bad that's a
06:38 - pretty good league right they say an
06:40 - average a person who can make around 90
06:42 - 000 that's that's like your epic
06:44 - happiness in terms of especially like
06:46 - for one person in terms of being able to
06:47 - afford a lot of different things right
06:49 - but just be clear right guys this is yes
06:51 - it says 87 thousand dollars that's great
06:54 - but you know that's not for everybody
06:55 - right it really depends on where your
06:56 - clash your location is if you live in
06:59 - summer like california it's a lot higher
07:01 - right if you live somewhere for example
07:02 - that's much cheaper it might be even
07:04 - lower right so right just clear it's it
07:06 - varies right it varies and it varies on
07:08 - your skill level and all of those things
07:10 - right so junior developers might make 40
07:12 - 000 or 30 000 a year but let me ask you
07:15 - guys this right one of the things that's
07:16 - super important for everybody to know
07:18 - and be aware of is like
07:20 - look we're we're all at a different
07:22 - level right but what's your level of
07:25 - happiness where you feel happy not
07:27 - everybody needs to make six figures like
07:29 - i don't need to be a billionaire for me
07:31 - to be happy so for you guys what's your
07:34 - threshold like of where you feel like
07:37 - you'll be living a peaceful life that
07:38 - you enjoy and that's the number that
07:41 - makes you happy drop that in the
07:42 - comments below and i want to see that
07:44 - and and don't let other people persuade
07:46 - you right for some of you might be like
07:48 - hey if i just make literally 28 000 a
07:50 - year working as a developer remotely
07:52 - while being a digital nomad in bali like
07:54 - that's the freaking
07:56 - dream right so so drop your numbers
08:00 - below and i want to see where you guys
08:02 - are at some of you might be like 46 000.
08:04 - some of you will like six figures but
08:05 - just stay true to yourself so i'm gonna
08:07 - start seeing it in the chat uh coming
08:09 - through
08:10 - um
08:11 - 150k we've got somebody 60k 165k
08:15 - something 500k damn dallas that's i mean
08:18 - that's pretty good that's pretty good
08:19 - you know yeah
08:21 - beautiful
08:22 - beautiful plus says 70k carlos
08:24 - 165k yeah
08:26 - 80k winners is 70k see you so like this
08:29 - computer peter on youtube says 90k uh
08:32 - brian says just enough 90k my
08:36 - micro size around 100k would be good
08:38 - okay beautiful um yeah so look everybody
08:42 - has a different goal that's totally fine
08:44 - like look if you're working at netflix
08:46 - those guys are making like 200 to 300
08:48 - 000 a year but it's not easy to get at
08:50 - netflix right you have to be really
08:52 - freaking good to get at netflix so
08:55 - again and sometimes too at the same time
08:57 - like you know people just don't want to
08:59 - work at a big company like that like i
09:00 - know someone you know who i personally
09:02 - have worked with previously who's worked
09:05 - like even amazon right i know him
09:07 - personally and he's like yeah yeah man
09:09 - you know i went to amazon i worked with
09:10 - them for like two weeks night and then i
09:12 - just quit yeah like it you know so
09:14 - really depends um the most important
09:16 - thing here guys is just learn the skill
09:18 - this skill that you will be learning
09:20 - here in terms of developer developer you
09:22 - know developer skill that is you can
09:24 - take that anywhere no matter what you
09:26 - want that is the value here if you get
09:28 - really good you can even take it to the
09:30 - bank
09:31 - let's move on so here is indeed right
09:34 - and i'm gonna try to move faster through
09:36 - some of these so there's tons of job
09:38 - openings my my goal to show you this is
09:40 - not just to go oh my god you're gonna
09:42 - become rich like tomorrow my goal is to
09:45 - just show you guys that there's a lot of
09:47 - opportunity regardless of even what's
09:49 - going on on the planet right now if you
09:52 - learn these skills
09:54 - they are not just for today but they're
09:56 - for tomorrow and the day after that and
09:58 - the year after that
09:59 - because coding and development is not
10:01 - going away and even with the whole new
10:04 - space of nfts and blockchain and crypto
10:07 - and all of that craziness is happening
10:09 - we're seeing some of our coding boot
10:11 - camp students like joshua hua
10:13 - interviewed a few days ago he came to
10:15 - our coding boot camp and he ended up
10:16 - landing a job at a crypto uh company and
10:19 - that company's called teller t-e-l-l-o-r
10:22 - and so
10:23 - there's tons of opportunity right like
10:25 - even that space is gonna need developers
10:27 - for tomorrow and that space is blowing
10:29 - up but yeah i mean it's like tons of job
10:30 - openings are available right this second
10:32 - for front end developers so this is just
10:34 - to show you guys like hey there's a lot
10:36 - that's happening here and it will keep
10:38 - growing that's the that's the coolest
10:39 - part about it too absolutely now let's
10:42 - touch base on the differences between
10:44 - front end and back end okay so
10:46 - front end and back end like you know
10:48 - there's so much jargon have you guys
10:50 - ever heard a front-end back-end you know
10:52 - i know there's some people who are
10:54 - intermediate i know some people are
10:55 - beginners so jeff says that he has
10:57 - dakota says that he has
10:59 - cool we're seeing a lot of text messages
11:01 - coming in yes yes yes yes yes cool
11:03 - awesome
11:04 - um so
11:06 - basically um you know it seems like you
11:09 - guys are aware of it but in simple terms
11:11 - front end is all the pretty stuff that
11:13 - you see
11:14 - that's visible or that you feel when you
11:16 - click things and click buttons and back
11:19 - end is like think about google search
11:20 - algorithm how it's able to like quickly
11:22 - find all these things or
11:24 - when you go to instagram and how all the
11:27 - posts are stored somewhere right like
11:29 - when you refresh instagram it's not like
11:30 - all the posts just vanish
11:32 - they're still there
11:34 - exactly exactly that that would not be a
11:36 - good user experience otherwise i
11:37 - wouldn't say that yeah like hey all the
11:39 - posts vanish every single time so now
11:42 - you might be asking what do i need to
11:44 - know to become a front-end developer in
11:46 - 2022 so let's um
11:49 - talk about it have have you guys ever
11:51 - seen any graphs like this by the way
11:55 - you know when you think about becoming a
11:56 - front-end developer either raise your
11:58 - hands or drop it in the chat or show it
12:00 - somewhere
12:03 - anybody seen those
12:04 - yeah oh nice alejandra gomez is a boot
12:06 - camp grad nice did the front end track
12:09 - so we got a ton of people have seen
12:11 - graphs like this okay but let me let me
12:14 - tell you guys something nasa what would
12:16 - you say about graphs like this and let's
12:18 - keep it pg because we don't want youtube
12:20 - to demonetize us
12:21 - i think they are
12:27 - nice thank you
12:28 - we do our own editing you guys is that
12:30 - is that pg enough for you so a lot of
12:33 - these graphs are not
12:36 - a representation of reality okay and
12:39 - that's like a understatement you know if
12:42 - i could be off of this i would say it in
12:44 - a much more um
12:46 - harsher way
12:48 - or whatever but like this is not really
12:51 - the reality right like for example i
12:53 - don't even know what this thing's stylus
12:55 - is
12:56 - but like i'm a developer
12:58 - yeah and it's the thing is like you know
13:00 - it's you know everybody says that so you
13:02 - all need to learn all these different
13:03 - things to actually get a job and to a
13:05 - lot of people
13:06 - i know to a lot of you guys probably it
13:08 - feels like that like you know if i don't
13:09 - know all these things i can't get the
13:12 - job done right
13:13 - but the thing is that's not the case
13:15 - right even if you know just one little
13:17 - tidbit off of that structure of that
13:19 - graph right even just one little tidbit
13:22 - that already is a value for the company
13:24 - already gives you the value to be able
13:26 - to go out to companies and to provide
13:27 - value to them right yes so this graph
13:30 - yes it's immense and there's probably
13:32 - people who know all this stuff as well
13:34 - right but to actually be able to get
13:36 - into the space this is not what you'll
13:39 - have to learn right we actually have a
13:40 - much better perspective on it so for
13:42 - example right like if you're looking at
13:44 - this html css javascript it's like look
13:46 - jquery is already like pretty outdated
13:49 - most i mean there's still some companies
13:51 - using it but like you can get jobs
13:53 - without ever knowing
13:56 - jquery you know without ever writing
13:58 - that weird dollar sign looking thing
14:00 - that i used to have to write and i used
14:01 - to think it was awesome
14:03 - um like you don't for example i learned
14:05 - jquery probably like
14:07 - three years or four years into my coding
14:08 - career personally honestly like right
14:11 - so it's like so when nasa is saying you
14:12 - need to know a little bit of it like for
14:14 - example
14:15 - you might not need to know all this
14:17 - testing and all this other stuff but
14:19 - like if you know javascript really
14:22 - freaking well you can actually go and
14:24 - get jobs
14:26 - true true right
14:28 - if you know javascript and if you know
14:30 - certain things on top of it but as a
14:31 - front-end developer like certain things
14:33 - that are going to be key when i think
14:34 - about it is i'm thinking html css
14:37 - javascript
14:38 - right i'm thinking like you probably
14:40 - need to know um you probably need to so
14:43 - css allows you to style we'll talk about
14:45 - that later
14:47 - you know pick any of these like you
14:49 - might just need to know one of these
14:50 - like bootstrap
14:52 - okay
14:53 - and
14:54 - with just even those few things i talked
14:56 - about you can build a lot of things you
14:58 - can build full-on front-end websites
15:01 - yeah and there's for example even like
15:03 - you know a student of ours uh our
15:04 - student who was actually here uh you
15:07 - know asked well do you somebody has told
15:09 - me that you need to learn typescript
15:10 - before you learn javascript right you
15:12 - know like that's not even the case right
15:14 - most companies don't even care if you
15:16 - learn typescript honestly like i didn't
15:17 - even know tyscript until probably two
15:19 - years ago and i've been coding for the
15:20 - past 10 years right so um you know it's
15:23 - like a nice to have like you have to
15:25 - look at what the core things you need to
15:26 - learn that really teach you the coding
15:28 - perspective right it's like it's like i
15:30 - like to think about it's about building
15:31 - a house it's like when you build a house
15:33 - you have to build the foundation yeah
15:34 - right and so in our cases there's only a
15:37 - few foundations that you need to learn
15:39 - but then you can have all the nice
15:40 - decorations you know all the beautiful
15:42 - things all the colors you can paint your
15:44 - walls as much as possible that's the
15:46 - other stuff that's not as important you
15:48 - know and we'll talk about exactly what
15:50 - is that core
15:52 - moving forward
15:53 - absolutely
15:54 - um so yeah let's keep on going it was so
15:57 - slick amanoth asked me to make him the
15:59 - co-host and i just it was so smooth how
16:01 - i did and i just transitioned back to
16:03 - zoom like that was cool all right let's
16:05 - keep going
16:06 - boom exactly yeah that transition this
16:10 - exact thing that came to my mind
16:13 - that's just what happened how you
16:14 - transitioned
16:16 - okay cool so let's keep on going so now
16:18 - let's simplify the process so it becomes
16:20 - easier for every single one of you okay
16:23 - um i'm looking at the youtube comments
16:25 - as well and they're like javascript is
16:27 - the cake if you have the foundations

18:16 - so
18:16 - tons of opportunities here right front
18:19 - end developer like okay i'm gonna wrap
18:21 - it fire through this who here would like
18:23 - to work as a remote developer making
18:24 - potentially 50 an hour raise your hands
18:27 - cool okay so we have some people who
18:29 - would like to work as a remote developer
18:31 - who here would like to work as a salary
18:34 - okay i want to talk about his lifestyles
18:36 - too like how would you want to do it so
18:38 - between a remote developer and a
18:40 - full-time developer in person which
18:43 - side you guys feel like you fall on
18:47 - freelance remote remote nice salary
18:49 - salary remote dev remote dev okay let me
18:52 - ask you another way full time versus
18:54 - freelance i want to start seeing chats
18:56 - coming through full time versus
18:57 - freelancers or maybe you want to try
18:59 - both freelance freelancers maybe you
19:01 - don't try both yeah can we get polls
19:04 - going thank you for the donation on
19:05 - youtube
19:06 - you have to make me a wholesaler
19:07 - unfortunately um oh dude don't make me a
19:11 - host because if you make me a host then
19:12 - you can't share it
19:14 - okay cool no it's all good
19:16 - you made someone else a co-host and not
19:18 - me oh lol
19:21 - um so maybe i was not as smooth as i
19:23 - thought i was
19:26 - okay
19:27 - who is the ghost i'm bad
19:29 - ah
19:30 - i'll find them i don't know i'll give up
19:32 - that's fine
19:36 - so we have a it seems like we have a
19:38 - split between freelance and full-time
19:40 - even on youtube we have freelance and
19:42 - full-time makes sense it's all good uh
19:45 - both are really really great one is more
19:47 - about safety so you know when you think
19:50 - freelance you know you i think freelance
19:53 - you have to be a little bit more um
19:55 - [Music]
19:56 - you know if you're if you're risk-averse
19:58 - then full-time is probably gonna be
20:00 - better because there's less risk you
20:02 - have essentially one client that's
20:04 - guaranteeing that you're going to have a
20:05 - job with them for a extended period of
20:07 - time freelance you know they can use you
20:10 - and then they can you know
20:12 - if they don't need you for the next
20:13 - months then that's that but you get to
20:16 - kind of be your own boss so there's
20:18 - there's both sides to it
20:21 - um
20:22 - cool
20:23 - yeah and then yeah and then there's tons
20:25 - of opportunities right i'm just showing
20:26 - you guys this you guys see again what's
20:28 - possible okay this is not so you'll get
20:30 - this tomorrow that's not what this is
20:32 - about
20:33 - yeah no no definitely here the key here
20:35 - guys is patience
20:38 - you need to start coding and start
20:40 - applying so what does this mean let's
20:41 - dive in okay
20:43 - let's talk about the fundamentals
20:46 - so when it comes to the fundamentals
20:47 - most people are you know there's all
20:50 - kinds of confusion going on on the
20:51 - internet
20:53 - um
20:54 - you know we're kind of part of that
20:55 - confusion on the internet too which is
20:57 - like we're showing you you know all
20:59 - these like hot frameworks and amazing
21:02 - things and i think that's cool right i
21:03 - think there's a lot of bells and
21:04 - whistles there it catches people's
21:06 - attention it's exciting but like you
21:08 - guys came here for the truth so we want
21:10 - to give you that you know
21:12 - so like the real thing is
21:14 - learn these three things that are in
21:16 - front of you really freaking well and
21:19 - these three things are one can you guys
21:22 - actually tell us
21:23 - so number one is
21:25 - i'm gonna give you five seconds i think
21:27 - you guys think five
21:30 - html the second one is
21:33 - css and the third one is
21:36 - javascript script beautiful
21:39 - so these are the three things and if you
21:41 - just learn these extremely well like
21:44 - extremely well
21:46 - you can have a lot of job opportunities
21:48 - available because
21:49 - even when if you listen to like nasa's
21:51 - story right and we don't have to get
21:53 - into the whole thing but like
21:55 - he got a job doing react and he actually
21:59 - didn't know any react at the time it was
22:00 - like he was a python developer but just
22:02 - a really good python developer yeah i'm
22:05 - just a really good developer in general
22:07 - in terms of i knew my
22:09 - core knowledge right i knew how to solve
22:11 - problems
22:12 - that's the key here right and then
22:14 - because of that i literally told the
22:16 - employer like listen i am not going to
22:18 - be your reactive i'm not a reg developer
22:20 - yet
22:20 - but i will learn it all of it fast and
22:23 - most importantly i could just solve a
22:24 - lot of problems for you so um with that
22:26 - said you know even though i failed all
22:28 - of his exams all his tests that he gave
22:30 - me um i still got the job somehow so
22:34 - there you go
22:35 - yeah seriously
22:37 - so
22:38 - um the main thing was that he failed the
22:40 - test right but he knew
22:43 - uh coding he failed the react tests
22:46 - because he didn't know react but they
22:48 - still hired him and they were able to
22:50 - teach him react because react builds on
22:53 - top of the fundamentals of
22:55 - core computer science and programming
22:58 - concepts and that nas knew really well
23:01 - okay so does that make sense guys like
23:03 - that understanding the core concepts and
23:06 - fundamentals is like the main thing
23:09 - right and everything on top of it is
23:10 - like cherry
23:12 - does that make sense can i get a thumbs
23:13 - up if that makes sense to you guys
23:16 - tammy thumbs up chris beautiful melissa
23:18 - fabio okay nice awesome anthony garcia
23:21 - in the chat garcia jesse gracie says
23:24 - devlop's queen here just be a quick
23:26 - learner you all got this i love these
23:28 - bits thank you thank you appreciate it
23:30 - beautiful and lax lifters commented and
23:32 - he said um
23:34 - you know companies will also pay you to
23:35 - learn if you have solid fundamentals
23:37 - your first two months can be paid
23:39 - training right so
23:41 - that's huge so when we talk about what
23:44 - these things are when we talk about html
23:46 - and we talk about css and we talk about
23:49 - javascript and sometimes it's confusing
23:50 - for people like what these things
23:52 - actually are
23:55 - html
23:56 - is really just a structure so you can
23:58 - think of it like the skeleton
24:01 - okay um it's like your skeleton what
24:03 - makes your body all right so it's the
24:06 - tables and the and the head tags and the
24:09 - you know the h1s and h2s if you guys
24:11 - have looked into it this is what the
24:13 - structure overall is so when you go to a
24:15 - landing page where's the headline
24:17 - where's the call to action button
24:19 - exactly exactly now your css for example
24:22 - is like your clothes right so example
24:24 - peter right you've got the headphones
24:27 - i'm guessing you probably got you know
24:28 - you've got a shirt on everything that's
24:29 - your css right it is what kind of you
24:32 - know uh
24:34 - that's the things you put on on yourself
24:36 - right
24:36 - now
24:37 - that's you know that's kind of i know if
24:40 - you compared to a website you know
24:41 - that's how a website looks beautiful
24:42 - otherwise it will look like i don't want
24:44 - to say it but crap right yeah um
24:47 - now
24:49 - portion however the javascript portion
24:52 - that is your movement right that's your
24:54 - dancing you know you're dancing you're
24:56 - having fun you know
24:57 - that is it is your brain that tells
25:00 - everything what to do so if you're going
25:02 - to a website for example right and on
25:04 - the website you click on buttons or you
25:06 - see some things happening you see
25:08 - interactions right for example when you
25:11 - click when you go to google you type in
25:13 - you know you type in your search and
25:14 - then you click google search and then
25:16 - you have the search results all that's
25:18 - happening through javascript guys right
25:19 - so yes there's a javascript portion of
25:21 - it yep so that's the javascript portion
25:24 - and it's that's what adds the dynamism
25:27 - that's when you click things and they
25:28 - load fast when you're on instagram right
25:30 - and you're scrolling and like when you
25:33 - go all the way to the bottom it does
25:34 - this little loading thing right and it
25:36 - loads more you have to like click a
25:37 - button and go to the next page
25:39 - that's like a fancy javascript concept
25:42 - you know and it's like a web development
25:44 - console which is known as like lazy
25:45 - loading and so that's where javascript
25:48 - and more dynamic things are coming into
25:50 - play okay when you hit the heart button
25:53 - or you double tap a post on instagram
25:55 - and it hurts it
25:57 - that's javascript
25:59 - okay
26:01 - um so
26:02 - cool i guess let me ask you guys these
26:05 - okay and you tell me which one it is is
26:06 - it html css or javascript so when you're
26:10 - on instagram okay
26:12 - and the background of a page is colored
26:16 - white
26:17 - okay it's colored white or it's colored
26:19 - black let me know what that is
26:22 - okay nice okay cool a lot responding
26:25 - good good job let me ask you something
26:27 - else so that's just a great job on that
26:29 - okay that's css let's make sure we get
26:31 - we give the actual thing yeah yes yes
26:32 - guys that's correct that's css everybody
26:34 - good job guys okay absolutely okay now
26:37 - let me ask you guys this okay
26:40 - if you go on to um
26:43 - those like old professor sites
26:47 - um
26:48 - that they would put up their homework
26:49 - for like a cs 151 class and it's like
26:52 - 1990s
26:56 - you know what is that mainly
27:00 - yes yes yes yes so we got ton of people
27:03 - saying it
27:08 - sam says sam says myspace
27:12 - that's so true okay i've actually got a
27:14 - trick one for you guys okay yes that's
27:16 - right it is html i gotta trick them for
27:17 - you you know how sometimes when
27:20 - you go somewhere let's just say you go
27:21 - on instagram or even go to google and
27:24 - you have like a loading icon like it's
27:25 - like loading it's like turning it's like
27:27 - turning right yeah so it's doing
27:29 - something
27:30 - what do you guys think that is
27:33 - because that's a trick question
27:36 - oh it is a trick question
27:41 - because a lot of people are saying it
27:43 - was javascript
27:45 - but actually
27:46 - it could be javascript but actually it's
27:48 - even css because with css you can
27:50 - actually make things turn as well so
27:52 - yeah
27:53 - yeah we're
27:54 - yeah we're tricking them now a little
27:56 - bit nice but yeah exactly so that that
27:58 - one is a little tricky one so i like
28:00 - that one uh now let me ask you guys
28:02 - another one when you guys uh let's say
28:05 - like a post
28:07 - right or you delete a post
28:11 - on instagram what is that is that html
28:14 - css or javascript happening
28:17 - boom we just got so many javascripts
28:19 - coming through
28:20 - beautiful awesome so great so you guys
28:22 - are you know hopefully getting a little
28:24 - bit of understanding of where they work
28:27 - and um what's happening so if you said
28:28 - javascript that was absolutely right
28:30 - let's move on
28:32 - so when we talk about html this is what
28:34 - html looks like okay
28:36 - um this is just htm so it's html here
28:40 - and then you know this is a heading
28:41 - where which line of code is this coming
28:44 - from say the number of the line in here
28:48 - that that is coming from
28:50 - boom even i don't know okay let's see it
28:53 - now beautiful um
28:56 - guys it is not number six you are wrong
28:58 - at this one
28:59 - nah he's lying just kidding
29:02 - yeah he's trying to trick you guys
29:04 - so there you go it is number six okay
29:07 - beautiful um
29:09 - so line number six is getting you this
29:12 - okay now what is getting you this this
29:14 - is a paragraph i mean this should be
29:15 - really easy so you guys should say it
29:17 - very fast beautiful this is coming from
29:20 - line seven okay line seven gets you this
29:23 - okay very simple
29:25 - all of the other stuff
29:28 - is just for fun um just kidding so
29:31 - that's kind of the overall structure of
29:33 - a html thing in the start it can look
29:36 - like a little intimidating but once you
29:37 - get used to it that's how
29:39 - html thing is usually structured
29:42 - cool that's right okay
29:44 - awesome let's go on to looking at a few
29:48 - more things okay so here is um we have
29:52 - some html
29:54 - inside of
29:56 - like
29:57 - javascript or
29:59 - we have some styling going on here
30:00 - actually
30:02 - right so take a look at this
30:04 - do you guys see do you guys notice where
30:06 - the html is with those tags here with
30:09 - the tags like that
30:11 - right so these this is all html now let
30:14 - me ask you guys this what do you think
30:16 - this part is
30:19 - beautiful yeah that's right it is the
30:21 - css that's right but there's a specific
30:23 - who can get who can tell me the specific
30:25 - word what type of css
30:27 - because there is actually a type of css
30:29 - what type of css is this one
30:31 - oh
30:32 - looks like we got who can who fancy in
30:35 - mean god this anthony got this that's
30:37 - right
30:37 - radula got this yes benjamin got this
30:40 - that's right it's called inline css guys
30:43 - yes exactly it's in line with actual
30:46 - html usually you'd have css outside in
30:49 - different file called a dot css file yes
30:52 - in this case it's in line with css and
30:54 - with html and another question okay
30:57 - this ugly green background which line of
31:01 - of the css is getting us this which line
31:04 - on the page is getting us this beautiful
31:07 - seeing a lot of people come through
31:09 - yes so line seven gets us this okay cool
31:13 - so it seems like you guys understand
31:14 - that okay and the font style where's the
31:17 - font style coming from real quick what
31:19 - line
31:20 - beautiful so line seven was the
31:22 - background and line six
31:24 - is the font so good job everybody nice
31:27 - okay damn they're all pros bro what are
31:28 - we doing here yeah you guys teach it
31:31 - we're leaving
31:32 - um
31:34 - cool so that's what's happening here
31:37 - okay so the console.log so this is now
31:39 - javascript okay it's the simplest
31:42 - javascript thing you could ever run
31:45 - console log hello and it says hello okay
31:47 - that's just javascript that's all that's
31:50 - happening here okay let's move on now
31:52 - you might be wondering like where can i
31:54 - learn these technologies of course some
31:56 - of you have already mentioned different
31:57 - resources somebody said linkedin
31:59 - learning there are a bunch of other
32:01 - resources that you can go online
32:03 - one of the resources we would recommend
32:05 - that you check out is we have tons and
32:07 - tons of content on youtube it's
32:09 - absolutely free
32:11 - enjoy it watch it it's hours and hours
32:13 - of training so you guys can go and
32:15 - bookmark it uh devlin says such a pretty
32:18 - face thank you so much
32:21 - i appreciate it
32:23 - um that boosts my self-esteem so thank
32:26 - you
32:28 - um
32:29 - in the last picture i'm very sad i don't
32:32 - know why but i'm really sad in the last
32:34 - one but i promise you
32:36 - it's a very exciting free course on
32:39 - javascript okay i love that still even
32:41 - though you know even though you're sad
32:42 - you know yeah yeah i think maybe you're
32:45 - sad because you know you had to spend a
32:46 - lot of time making it yeah it's been
32:48 - just really tired in the end the reason
32:50 - why i'm actually sad is i did a
32:52 - thumbnail a b test and this thumbnail
32:55 - where i was sadder one compared to the
32:57 - other thumbnails so i don't know why
32:59 - youtube did that but that's the real
33:01 - truth okay
33:02 - yeah
33:03 - so it was just so we can get more clicks
33:05 - on this so we can teach more people
33:08 - online okay so yeah there we go
33:11 - cool so check out those resources now
33:13 - did you guys know
33:15 - javascript completed its ninth year in a
33:18 - row as the most commonly used
33:19 - programming language according to stack
33:21 - overflow
33:22 - no way really flex
33:26 - that is flex did you flip java
33:28 - javascript needs to have an nft
33:29 - javascript used to have oh
33:32 - don't say this out loud bro we need to
33:34 - launch these nft projects outside of
33:36 - class no this is a great idea if
33:38 - somebody wants to take that go for it
33:40 - javascript nfts would be awesome
33:42 - i agree with that one
33:44 - so
33:45 - going through this right
33:47 - this is according to stack overflow one
33:49 - of the most favorite technologies of
33:51 - most developers and this is from 58 000
33:54 - responses is javascript
33:56 - right and then right behind is html css
33:59 - okay now i know somebody's gonna be
34:01 - commenting but don't start a programming
34:03 - language
34:05 - i don't i don't want to fight you i
34:08 - don't care
34:09 - it's
34:10 - i love you if you're watching this i
34:12 - love you regardless oh god you're wrong
34:14 - there's no no you know this is not right
34:16 - you're not doing this rightly no yeah
34:19 - that's look javascript is a programming
34:21 - language html and css are not
34:23 - programming languages there you go okay
34:25 - all right cool now what's next all right
34:29 - you need to learn a front-end framework
34:31 - on top of javascript so that's why we're
34:33 - talking about react
34:35 - and teaching you guys these things okay
34:37 - so
34:38 - frameworks
34:40 - there's the react logo
34:41 - frameworks are very simple
34:44 - do you guys want to take a shot at what
34:46 - a framework is
34:47 - drop it in the comments or or chat and
34:50 - let me know what you think a framework
34:52 - is okay let's see if you know
34:54 - like what is it guys don't don't give us
34:56 - the frameworks but right i know people
34:58 - in the comments also they're gonna be
35:00 - like react as a library and i knew that
35:03 - but like
35:04 - i know people are going to be going
35:05 - crazy about that but but just give me
35:07 - what a library slash framework is okay
35:10 - yeah
35:12 - yeah
35:13 - yeah gracie was like yeah they on it i
35:16 - actually like it gracie was like it's
35:17 - code that's been written for you that's
35:19 - actually not a bad explanation yeah so i
35:21 - see a lot of your guys's like
35:23 - explanations coming in that's great
35:24 - somebody says set of rules library reuse
35:26 - code templates consolidated yeah i like
35:29 - it a lot of it is it's yeah i mean i
35:31 - love that gracie explanation it's so
35:33 - simple it's code that's written for you
35:35 - essentially and then it makes your life
35:37 - a lot easier so if you use react it
35:40 - makes it so much easier to do the things
35:42 - that you want to do compared to like
35:43 - when you try to do it with just vanilla
35:45 - javascript
35:47 - it's much much harder actually
35:49 - um
35:50 - and so react will make your life way
35:53 - easier you know that's why we recommend
35:55 - it there are other frameworks out there
35:57 - too like angular
35:59 - vue.js and you can learn all of those
36:01 - there's svelt which is really good uh
36:04 - there's ember
36:05 - alpine js and a ton of others okay
36:08 - yes but according to stack overflow
36:10 - survey react.js is now the most popular
36:14 - web framework surpassing even jquery so
36:17 - it's taken it over okay so it's the most
36:19 - popular framework and that's kind of why
36:21 - we want to cover it because i think
36:22 - it'll help the most amount of people and
36:25 - why do we because a lot of people like
36:27 - why do you guys care so much about
36:28 - popularity because we care about your
36:30 - results and
36:32 - and job demand and job demand right like
36:34 - we could be teaching you svelte it's
36:35 - pretty cool and it's pretty fun but not
36:37 - all these jobs are gonna be like hiring
36:40 - for svelte so then your like pool
36:42 - becomes a lot smaller and it becomes
36:44 - much more competitive whereas like react
36:47 - there's way more demand
36:49 - than there's like supply of developers
36:51 - and so we want to like help you and
36:54 - produce more developers that fulfill
36:55 - that demand if that makes sense you know
36:57 - what's funny actually i started out with
36:59 - angular when i was first starting out
37:01 - with in in web development and then i
37:03 - actually moved to react because i had a
37:05 - you know a few more job offers that were
37:08 - in react yes so there you go
37:09 - uh
37:10 - okay i see so
37:13 - uh yeah you love money
37:15 - yeah okay awesome so no that's that's
37:18 - smart that's smart and i mean for most
37:20 - developers right your career matters
37:22 - like you work for money right that's the
37:23 - whole point you're exchanging your time
37:25 - for
37:26 - a dollar currency value so you might as
37:29 - well
37:30 - you know do it in a beneficial way
37:33 - yeah of course cool so web frameworks
37:36 - right here we have all these web
37:37 - frameworks and react is the number one
37:40 - as you guys can see so it's a good one
37:42 - that you guys should learn should use
37:44 - and if you're a complete beginner right
37:45 - now you know it's like hey just focus on
37:47 - html css javascript and then learn react
37:50 - on top of it
37:51 - that's going to be the best path for you
37:53 - to kind of learn all this okay
37:56 - now here are the companies right that
37:58 - are using these types of you know that
38:00 - are using javascript and react and
38:03 - airbnb instagram facebook skype netflix
38:07 - dropbox and and twitter you know and the
38:09 - list just goes on so there are massive
38:12 - companies that are powered by these
38:13 - technologies yeah especially i mean all
38:15 - these technologies technically even use
38:17 - react.js right so you know between
38:19 - facebook to dropbox and netflix in some
38:20 - sort of way they're using that
38:22 - technology either on the front of the
38:23 - website right or even in their
38:25 - application for example if you guys know
38:27 - tesla anybody here know tesla
38:30 - anybody
38:31 - yeah there we go nathaniel yeah there
38:33 - you go all right so everybody of course
38:34 - the car company right but if you guys
38:36 - don't know but their main application
38:38 - right uh that you use on your phone to
38:40 - actually even open your car like
38:42 - literally you can you know the the phone
38:44 - opens your car it's the key to your car
38:46 - it's usually for example react
38:47 - technology it's used something called
38:48 - react native yeah right so that right
38:51 - there is just such a big opportunity you
38:53 - know if you learn the technology you can
38:55 - use it in so many places absolutely
38:58 - absolutely and facebook invented
39:03 - react
39:05 - yeah
39:07 - but what is facebook i don't even know
39:10 - what that is
39:11 - that's not a company
39:14 - yeah it's meta it's meta now it's not
39:17 - facebook yeah it's meta uh well were you
39:20 - guys like how did you guys feel about
39:22 - the the
39:24 - mark zuckerberg's like announcement on
39:26 - it like were you guys excited or are you
39:28 - guys more mostly like creeped out like
39:30 - what what was your guys's uh
39:34 - yeah say it's not facebook no more it is
39:36 - meta confusion
39:42 - all right i mean damn
39:44 - what do you i mean okay hold on what do
39:46 - you guys think about what we're sharing
39:48 - with you so far please be nice
39:53 - i love it okay awesome thank you anthony
39:55 - is like five dollars i appreciate it
39:58 - appreciate it thank you all right we're
39:59 - gonna keep rocking and rolling so you
40:00 - guys keep getting more and more value
40:02 - okay so now let's talk about your
40:04 - next
40:05 - steps
40:06 - huh
40:08 - okay
40:09 - um you guys are gonna get what i mean in
40:11 - a little bit
40:12 - um some of you have already probably
40:14 - gotten that okay cool so learn a css
40:17 - preprocessor framework okay so there's
40:20 - other types of things you can use with
40:22 - css so for example tailwind the logo
40:25 - that we just popped up at the top left
40:26 - is a really
40:28 - nice thing
40:29 - to learn
40:31 - and and have an understanding of because
40:33 - it'll make writing your css a lot easier
40:37 - and it won't just look like your website
40:39 - is made out of bootstrap so it'll be
40:41 - nice from a design perspective and
40:43 - making your design more unique
40:45 - the next thing that you can learn is
40:47 - bootstrap okay so that's also really
40:49 - good
40:50 - sass bunch of other stuff style
40:53 - components which are super awesome when
40:55 - you're using react that make your code
40:57 - so much easier and easier to read and
41:00 - you don't need these extra css files
41:02 - that's personally how i like to code in
41:04 - react i don't like to have all these
41:07 - extra css files i haven't even used a
41:09 - css file in a while actually my
41:13 - with react my javascript html and css
41:16 - essentially just live in one javascript
41:18 - file so it's yeah it's really nice and
41:21 - it makes it easy for me to process and
41:23 - you guys will actually be able to see
41:24 - that you know starting tomorrow because
41:26 - we will be using one of these
41:28 - technologies tail and css together kind
41:30 - of a style components
41:32 - to put css into your javascript so it's
41:34 - gonna be really cool it's probably
41:35 - something you haven't seen before so
41:37 - stay tuned yeah i heard like somebody
41:39 - said fang is now changed to manga
41:42 - because facebook is now uh meta
41:46 - oh
41:47 - snap son we got frank in the house
41:50 - frank ramos just dropped the 20 donation
41:54 - yo guys let's give it up for frank ramos
41:56 - thank you so much brother
41:58 - we appreciate it wow wow wow we got
42:02 - his donation is 19.99 yeah thank you bro
42:06 - i appreciate it you know much love and
42:08 - nice seeing you after a while
42:10 - um
42:11 - all right cool i'm happy about that here
42:15 - is a material ui material ui is a great
42:18 - one to learn as well you don't have to
42:20 - learn all of these by the way uh just a
42:23 - few of them are like pretty good like
42:24 - for example if you want to just pick up
42:26 - tailwind
42:27 - you can just pick up tailwind now
42:29 - word of precaution
42:31 - for all of you for people who are
42:33 - beginners which are a majority of you on
42:35 - this call
42:37 - um just learn css first okay
42:40 - like
42:41 - just like learn css first you know watch
42:44 - my battle with nas no i'm kidding just
42:47 - like
42:48 - learn the basics of css
42:51 - and then build on top of it okay just
42:53 - like remember how javascript you learn
42:55 - javascript and then you learn react on
42:57 - top of it
42:59 - just learn css first and then learn any
43:02 - of these other things on top of it
43:04 - because if you try to
43:06 - just go to styled components like
43:08 - without learning css you're going to be
43:10 - very confused or if you go to like
43:12 - tailwind you're going to be very
43:13 - confused because you'll be like oh this
43:16 - nice thing i can just write in like
43:18 - px-10
43:20 - but you won't understand that that's
43:21 - like padding you know horizontal or
43:23 - padding vertical whatever 10 and you'll
43:25 - be like what's padding
43:26 - you know go to css to learn that so i
43:28 - think the better way to learn is learn
43:31 - css first
43:32 - yeah and then all the all these other
43:34 - things will be a lot easier for you guys
43:36 - to understand absolutely absolutely
43:38 - next up my beautiful people is going to
43:41 - be learning get version control okay
43:44 - whoops one is so important guys so
43:47 - important right so
43:48 - any developer when you go into any job
43:51 - they will expect you guys to learn this
43:53 - right
43:54 - and anybody here knows what exactly is
43:57 - it and what is it used for i'm curious
43:59 - put that on the chat right and and
44:02 - what i would recommend is you guys take
44:04 - notes on it because i think this is
44:05 - going to set you up for the rest of the
44:07 - year actually so like make sure that if
44:10 - you weren't already like you know bring
44:11 - a notebook or something and like write
44:13 - it down so you're not distracted and and
44:16 - take notes on this so so you have this
44:18 - exact outline with you and anthony just
44:21 - got up to seems like he to get his book
44:23 - or notebook albert just got up nice cool
44:26 - yeah but looks like reuben is doing
44:27 - something there too so yeah that's
44:29 - beautiful nice job ruben already has it
44:32 - reuben came prepared nathaniel came
44:33 - prepared let's go
44:37 - sam sam came prepared nice he's always
44:40 - prepared
44:42 - sorry we if we lola says
44:44 - you know git was used to see different
44:47 - versions of your code remotely that's
44:48 - actually a really good way you know it's
44:50 - kind of like yeah you know kazi you know
44:52 - you say it so i'm going to steal your
44:54 - line yeah but
44:55 - that's fine but it's like dropbox for
44:57 - coding right it's like dropbox for your
45:00 - code yes imagine if you were to work if
45:02 - ruby for example if you were to work
45:04 - with joe for example right
45:06 - you know you guys might work on the same
45:08 - project but how do you keep the
45:10 - project in check right maybe ruben
45:12 - you're working on one on the login page
45:14 - joe you're working potentially on the
45:17 - you know the home page right you need to
45:19 - have some sort of way where you guys
45:22 - sync those projects together well yes
45:24 - and it comes in git
45:26 - and github absolutely
45:29 - yeah so this is um
45:31 - what nas said is like really
45:34 - really just on the money right i think
45:36 - he he said it brilliantly
45:38 - um and
45:40 - you know the way it it's just like a you
45:42 - know what not said also is it's a time
45:44 - machine
45:45 - and if you messed up if you're like just
45:46 - imagine i'll start with the simplest way
45:49 - of it right it's a time machine for your
45:51 - code and it allows you if you if you
45:52 - guys any anybody here plays video games
45:54 - raise your hands
45:56 - you know and you've experienced what a
45:58 - checkpoint is
45:59 - right so in video games you have these
46:02 - checkpoints and you can save and then
46:03 - you can come back and you can even roll
46:05 - back sometimes to different checkpoints
46:07 - just like that for your code you could
46:09 - have different checkpoints and then
46:11 - you're like oh
46:13 - my app is just now like let's say you
46:14 - build the login page and now all of a
46:16 - sudden your app just broke we just go
46:18 - back in time to when it wasn't broken
46:20 - anymore
46:21 - and then start from there again
46:24 - um
46:25 - and whatnot said allows you to
46:26 - collaborate and build things together
46:28 - with other developers okay so
46:31 - it's going to be really important to
46:33 - learn just make sure you have it in your
46:35 - roadmap like git is going to be a key
46:38 - thing to learn like for example you
46:40 - probably don't need to learn style
46:41 - components to get a job but i think like
46:44 - git is going to be a very important
46:45 - component when you need to get a job
46:47 - because they're going to want to you
46:48 - know be able to see that you can work
46:50 - with other developers because if you
46:52 - don't do this you really can't work with
46:53 - other developers
46:54 - yeah and jonathan for example said you
46:56 - know my problems understanding how to
46:58 - use it right and if you're of course you
47:01 - know sometimes it does feel a bit
47:02 - confusing and how this works right
47:05 - honestly
47:06 - there's a lot of like you know tutorials
47:08 - that told you tell you all these things
47:10 - about how to use kit and all these
47:11 - different ways to use kit but if you
47:14 - just simplify it to three four
47:16 - functionalities for example you can
47:18 - write this down guys i was gonna say
47:19 - this too actually that's perfect go for
47:21 - it yeah so like for example like git
47:23 - push right get a pool can i give them an
47:26 - order
47:28 - yeah go ahead okay so write this down in
47:30 - this order this is going to be really
47:32 - helpful okay number one get init
47:36 - right frank just made another 50

48:53 - let's get back to it number one get in
48:55 - it that's number one okay that will like
48:58 - start your like
49:00 - git project in most cases okay

49:07 - space
49:08 - add space dot so git add dot okay
49:13 - get add dot
49:14 - all right that's the second one
49:16 - the third one
49:19 - is git commit dash m followed by
49:22 - whatever your message is okay so um
49:25 - maybe i could actually type it out it
49:27 - will start to get deleted as i type it
49:29 - out i guess
49:31 - yeah that's still weird
49:34 - that was weird where did my you have to
49:36 - click x click escape there we go okay
49:39 - cool that's the weird part about it so
49:41 - how about this maybe we can just put it
49:43 - in the in the chat so like let's just
49:45 - put that in the chat so like get i'll do

50:07 - sure the g is lowercased yeah yeah sorry
50:09 - because it does automatically cool uh
50:11 - and the fourth one
50:14 - is going to be get push origin master
50:17 - okay git push origin master i know right
50:20 - now you're like what the hell are these
50:22 - why am i memorizing them it's it's not
50:24 - so you can memorize it so you can know
50:26 - that that's 99
50:28 - of git like you do that you're pretty
50:30 - much good 99 percent of the times
50:33 - there's other
50:34 - donations sorry for gone it says thank
50:36 - you guys for all i support you from
50:38 - beginning of the road beginning to end
50:40 - big fans appreciate all the time and
50:41 - we'll keep up the good work yo thank you
50:44 - appreciate it really really appreciate
50:46 - it thank you so much
50:48 - uh super super awesome yep
50:51 - um so those are the the four main ones
50:54 - that are gonna be absolutely amazing and
50:56 - then i'm just gonna give you like two
50:58 - other ones that i think you should just
50:59 - write it down the reason why i'm giving
51:01 - this to you is here's what's gonna
51:02 - happen you're not gonna write them down
51:04 - right now and you're gonna be like
51:05 - that's fine i'll learn git later
51:07 - you're going to be so freaking confused
51:09 - because whenever you go to look up
51:10 - anything about git they're going to just
51:12 - like
51:13 - destroy your brain with so much
51:15 - complexity and they're going to be like
51:17 - giving you all these commands with all
51:19 - these flags and branches and checkouts
51:22 - and rebasing and you're like i don't
51:23 - need to know these things right now
51:25 - you're like what are the main things do
51:27 - i need to just be able to do all of this
51:29 - with that's what i'm giving you okay
51:31 - the last two um is git clone
51:36 - have that written down that's going to
51:37 - be needed for you like
51:39 - that's yeah that's going to be needed
51:41 - okay so git clone
51:42 - and then uh the last one is get pull
51:45 - origin master
51:47 - okay get pull origin master
51:49 - so if you have these five or six
51:51 - commands that i've given you
51:53 - and you just re you you don't have to
51:55 - memorize and just write them down
51:56 - somewhere
51:58 - this is it that's it like 99 of what you
52:01 - need to do you'll be able to do it
52:02 - you'll be able to like get a pro
52:04 - download a project you'll be able to
52:06 - like write code you'll be able to commit
52:08 - it aka checkpoints you'll be able to
52:10 - push it pushing all it does is it's just
52:12 - putting it on dropbox okay or just
52:14 - putting it on um
52:16 - you know drop box of code which is
52:18 - github okay yeah cool
52:20 - gigi ishan and youtube says you can
52:22 - pretty much learn git in like an hour
52:24 - yeah you know once i probably guess is
52:26 - just start to use it start out simply by
52:29 - just using it with like something like
52:31 - get in it and you'll see right away
52:33 - things happen you just have to start
52:34 - using it because the hardest thing is
52:36 - there's probably fear in trying to get
52:38 - into it yes that's the biggest thing
52:40 - you're right now that's the biggest fear
52:42 - that stops specially beginners and like
52:44 - you don't want to touch it i know let me
52:46 - ask you who is afraid of get raise your
52:48 - freaking hands and drop it in the
52:50 - comments who's afraid of git
52:52 - so many people have this
52:53 - exactly see see
52:55 - yeah we got tons of hands going up right
52:57 - people saying me me me
52:59 - yeah carlos is like lmao me
53:01 - uh daniel says i yeah
53:04 - um
53:06 - so that's what i'm saying it's scary but
53:08 - like if you just know that there are
53:10 - like three commands but
53:12 - my work when i'm working when i'm
53:14 - actually coding up a project i'm
53:16 - literally just doing git add dot like
53:18 - git add git commit get pushed get ad get
53:20 - commit get pushed get ad get commit get
53:22 - pushed get out get commit get pushed
53:23 - it's like three commands i'm just doing
53:25 - them again and again and again and again
53:27 - and again for like 10 hours as i'm doing
53:29 - my coding project like
53:30 - it's the easiest workflow once you get
53:33 - it it's just the initial fear that's
53:34 - going to stop you so my urge to use like
53:36 - overcome that fear and just like get
53:38 - into it those are the few commands that
53:40 - i we gave you that are the holy grail of
53:43 - all of git and then anything else is
53:45 - just like extra complex stuff that
53:48 - you'll you'll just pick it up as you go
53:50 - thanks very agree they're critical cool
53:52 - so uh what i want to show you guys
53:55 - is
53:56 - this okay
53:58 - keynote is weird uh is this so this logo
54:01 - over here which do you guys know which
54:03 - logo this is here on the left hand side
54:06 - what is it
54:08 - so on the left-hand side this is
54:11 - good that's right this is git
54:14 - this is get over here and what's this
54:17 - logo right over here do you guys know
54:20 - okay beautiful they already knew what i
54:21 - was gonna do next wow
54:24 - beautiful mine man yeah that was awesome
54:26 - so this is github
54:28 - git
54:30 - github
54:33 - they are
54:34 - uh let me ask you guys are they the same
54:36 - thing or are they very similar are they
54:38 - like the same thing git and github
54:41 - git and github are not the same thing
54:44 - it's a very common confusion that a lot
54:46 - of people have they are different okay
54:49 - github is dropbox for your code the
54:52 - simplest way i can put it
54:54 - yes
54:55 - it's like google or if you don't know
54:56 - dropbox like google drive for your code
54:58 - it's like where you're putting your code
55:00 - online yeah it's like it's a remote
55:02 - right while git the left-hand side as
55:04 - you guys see that's your version control
55:07 - that is what's going to keep track of
55:09 - all the changes so for example let's
55:10 - just say you make a small change you add
55:13 - a button you make that into a change it
55:14 - will keep track of that yes they'll say
55:16 - maybe you add a background you know a
55:19 - background image or a background photo
55:21 - boom that's a change you keep track of
55:22 - that yes
55:23 - so it will keep track track of those
55:25 - changes locally so you can always you
55:27 - know like time machine and like i just
55:28 - said you know in terms of a time machine
55:30 - you can always go back and forth
55:33 - but in order for other people to use it
55:35 - right to see it right for example like
55:38 - your you know the people you work with
55:40 - then you would push it to github that's
55:43 - the big differentiation
55:44 - absolutely exactly
55:46 - um so let's keep going and yeah git lab
55:49 - is i see some people talking about git
55:51 - lab git lab is like github
55:53 - git lab is um like another place like
55:56 - google drive where you can put your code
55:58 - there's bitbucket too there's a bunch of
55:59 - places where you could put your code
56:01 - okay
56:03 - all right now we're gonna get into some
56:05 - more like complicated stuff so this is
56:07 - like gonna be the in the next part of
56:09 - your journey so write this down guys
56:11 - it's server side rendering okay
56:14 - so what the heck is server side
56:16 - rendering
56:17 - and here's an example of it now do you
56:19 - want to take a shot at explaining what
56:20 - this is
56:22 - yes i will take a shot but before i do
56:23 - that i just want to say thank you so
56:25 - much for appall for paul for another
56:27 - generation thank you
56:28 - you for helping us change our lives of
56:30 - course that's where we're here
56:31 - this is sick we need to be going live at
56:34 - 5 00 p.m every day
56:36 - i know i realize that too
56:38 - this is awesome
56:40 - wow beautiful so servers are rendering
56:42 - guys right right with react.js for
56:44 - example you know if you look at for
56:46 - example google or let's just say you go
56:48 - on facebook okay when you go on facebook
56:50 - anybody here ever see that when you go
56:51 - on facebook the first thing it loads is
56:53 - probably your header and then it kind of
56:56 - loads your post right after anybody here
56:58 - see that like you know did you guys
56:59 - notice that by any chance when you go to
57:01 - facebook
57:02 - well yes that's right that's because you
57:03 - know it renders the things you know on
57:05 - the client side that's right it runs
57:07 - thing on the client side so basically
57:09 - you know it takes time after your page
57:11 - is loaded
57:12 - to load other things
57:14 - however with server side rendering it's
57:17 - basically like you are sh
57:20 - rendering your your creating all the
57:22 - posts
57:23 - behind the scenes and then just slapping
57:26 - on it
57:27 - to be for people to see
57:28 - well it's kind of like that's right so
57:30 - in this case for example the the server
57:32 - for example is cooking noodles right the
57:34 - actual server yeah right then the
57:36 - noodles already cooked and those cooked
57:38 - noodles are already shown to you ah
57:40 - beautiful that's right versus for
57:42 - example in react g.s right not xgs you
57:46 - would actually be still you would still
57:48 - be cooking the noodles while you're on
57:50 - the page uh okay you see what i mean
57:53 - that's the big difference so basically
57:55 - like so basically before it's almost
57:58 - like the client or me if i'm logging
58:00 - into facebook i'm doing the work of
58:02 - loading it
58:03 - exactly right whereas now it's almost
58:06 - like facebook is doing the work of
58:07 - loading it before i even get there it's
58:09 - ready to go
58:10 - exactly and the reason why that's so
58:12 - much better is because then pages low a
58:15 - lot faster
58:17 - it's like all your posts have already
58:19 - been pre-loaded
58:20 - right they've already been pre-loaded
58:22 - all it is is just a bunch of html yes
58:24 - you're still right away for the user you
58:27 - see it really fast yes and then also
58:30 - here's a kicker guys listen up this
58:32 - it's really cool because then your seo
58:35 - or google loves you google love oh yeah
58:39 - rendered pages yeah that's why the
58:41 - people are starting to head towards that
58:44 - because it increases your optimization
58:46 - anybody here knows seo or what seo
58:49 - stands for raise your hand if you do
58:51 - raise your hand if you do
58:53 - no
58:54 - no okay so seo search engine
58:57 - optimization basically it's like you
58:59 - know the more the better your seo the
59:02 - higher up you will show uh on the actual
59:05 - google rankings so instead of you
59:08 - instead of your page being shown on the
59:10 - second page of google your page will be
59:12 - shown on the first page of google does
59:14 - that make sense everybody does that make
59:16 - sense yes got it good job awesome albert
59:19 - thank you god cool cool cool cool cool
59:21 - yeah so that is the big difference here
59:23 - server side and
59:25 - the create guys the crazy thing is that
59:28 - we're actually going to be learning
59:29 - we're going to be using server-side
59:31 - rendering actually
59:33 - in this uber clone so yeah so hopefully
59:35 - you guys are excited about that okay
59:37 - we're gonna try to make it as simple as
59:38 - possible for y'all i'm pumped
59:41 - awesome
59:42 - um okay cool
59:44 - apparently this was a video oh look at
59:47 - that client-side rendering
59:52 - oh
59:53 - yeah so this is kind of a cool um you
59:55 - know the way to show it is like
59:58 - before client-side rendering is like you
60:00 - make your own food
60:02 - yeah see as i was saying on the although
60:04 - all the way on the right-hand side
60:06 - you're making your own food
60:08 - okay
60:09 - and then um
60:11 - on this side server side you're coming
60:15 - home to a chef that's making your food
60:17 - and they played it for you so basically
60:20 - the simplest way for you to remember it
60:21 - is server side is nice and it's going to
60:24 - help you and make things faster
60:26 - joe was like let's make some noodles i
60:28 - agree with and the types of websites
60:30 - this is better for is where there's a
60:33 - lot of user generated content okay so if
60:36 - there's user generated content it's
60:38 - better to go server side rendering if
60:41 - you have a static portfolio website
60:43 - where there's not anything happening and
60:45 - nothing will ever change and it's just
60:46 - set in stone and nobody can add anything
60:48 - new and there's no authentication and
60:50 - there's no
60:52 - you should go with
60:54 - let me ask you which one should you go
60:56 - with so you have static site option you
60:58 - have client side option you have server
60:59 - side option it's a little bit advanced
61:00 - if you're a complete beginner you have
61:02 - no idea it's totally okay you're in the
61:03 - right place don't worry i'm just
61:05 - throwing in some things to keep the
61:06 - intermediates a little bit happy you
61:08 - know
61:09 - so static site is the way to go okay
61:12 - static site is the way to go um cool all
61:15 - right let's uh keep rocking and rolling
61:18 - okay so you guys
61:20 - go ahead sorry i was gonna say on the
61:22 - right hand side you guys saw how that
61:24 - one was much faster and on the left hand
61:26 - side it's still loading
61:29 - right so like this is
61:31 - the difference here is on the right hand
61:33 - side the server has already done the
61:35 - work for you
61:37 - you know and then the before one is
61:38 - client-side and it's like you're doing
61:40 - the work
61:43 - so you can see the speed difference so
61:45 - like let me ask you guys right which
61:47 - experience would be better the one on
61:48 - the right-hand side for you or the one
61:50 - on the left-hand side
61:51 - you know do you want to wait one second
61:53 - to have your app loaded or like four
61:55 - seconds
61:56 - yep boom got tons of people saying right
61:58 - yep exactly
62:00 - imagine just being the website trying to
62:01 - wait for it to load for like 10 seconds
62:03 - straight that's not a good experience
62:04 - you'll be like peace out
62:06 - so now the business implications of this
62:09 - right if you're a big company like let's
62:11 - imagine you're
62:13 - google or trello or facebook or some big
62:15 - company um
62:17 - going from four seconds
62:19 - going from four seconds to one second
62:22 - how much percentage improvement have you
62:24 - made
62:25 - like what x improvement have you made
62:28 - here
62:29 - i'm not a mathematician and i'm probably
62:31 - just going to round it up to something
62:32 - dumb but like you've improved it by
62:35 - almost three to four hundred percent
62:37 - right that's what you guys are dropping
62:38 - in the chat you've been through three to
62:40 - four hundred percent so if you improve
62:42 - google or facebook by 300 to 400 percent
62:45 - do you know what you've
62:46 - done well yeah i mean you imported by 75
62:50 - percent around around that or improved
62:51 - some of the 75 right but it's like
62:54 - but but that reduction is massive
62:56 - massive right it's massive reduction
62:58 - that you've done and when you do that
63:01 - and you add that much improvement to
63:03 - something like now the user retention is
63:06 - gonna like almost double for facebook
63:08 - you know or close to that which means
63:10 - like now they're gonna make almost two
63:12 - times the money they made or one and a
63:14 - half times so it's like a huge increase
63:17 - these are simplified examples
63:19 - but but there's a huge
63:21 - like from a business perspective there's
63:23 - a huge value proposition to being able
63:25 - to do things like this and i hope that
63:27 - makes sense for you guys yeah and sam
63:29 - asked the question you know with service
63:31 - around does that mean that you know on
63:33 - the server it's going to be a heavy load
63:35 - as in
63:36 - the people need to spend more money on
63:38 - the server hardware well
63:40 - sometimes yes that is the case but the
63:42 - money spent on that hardware is a lot
63:44 - less than what you will earn right as if
63:47 - you spent it right you would earn a lot
63:49 - more yeah you know in terms of because
63:51 - there will be a lot more customers than
63:53 - you know of you just spending you know
63:55 - some some money on some hardware yes
63:58 - yeah that's that's a good way to put
64:00 - that
64:00 - so here is the most popular framework
64:03 - that is built on react that allows you
64:06 - to do server side rendering and that's
64:08 - the reason why it's blowing up so much
64:11 - and it's called next.js
64:14 - and this is the
64:15 - this is the framework that we kind of
64:17 - referenced a little bit earlier and you
64:18 - can see over here it's being downloaded
64:20 - about 1.8 million times and when that
64:23 - happens you know that that package is
64:24 - hot there's tons of community around it
64:27 - it also means there are tons of job
64:29 - opportunities i mean not all the time
64:31 - but most of the times it means like
64:32 - there's tons of job opportunities around
64:34 - this and now netflix and all a lot of
64:36 - big companies are switching over and
64:38 - starting using next and just keep in
64:40 - mind you still have to learn react it's
64:42 - built on top of react
64:44 - yes okay and it's very interesting
64:46 - actually frank in
64:48 - on youtube said walmart is implementing
64:51 - server-side rendering so it helps with a
64:53 - lot of e-commerce stores yes
64:55 - that's a great one actually yeah yeah
64:58 - uh yeah that's that's a really good one
65:01 - exactly so walmart is about to use it as
65:03 - well
65:04 - and yeah so let's go ahead joe says
65:07 - nextgs is dope yes it is all right and
65:10 - now if you're looking for a static
65:12 - you know more static framework um is
65:16 - gatsby that's a really good one for if
65:18 - you're trying to build like blazing fast
65:20 - portfolio sites and things like that
65:22 - gatsby's a good one to keep in mind
65:24 - your
65:25 - speed wise you're probably not ever
65:27 - going to beat it until maybe something
65:29 - else comes out but if you're doing some
65:32 - simple website that is static i would
65:35 - highly recommend to look into gatsby
65:38 - and then of course there's things like
65:40 - testing your application so you know the
65:42 - next step is when your application is
65:44 - done how do you test it and testing
65:46 - basically means if you have a login page
65:48 - you have a page that accepts payments
65:49 - right
65:50 - imagine if you're not testing it
65:52 - constantly well what if it breaks so let
65:54 - me ask you guys this right imagine you
65:56 - are
65:57 - uh kylie jenner
65:59 - and you just launched your new product
66:03 - and you know so many people hit our
66:06 - checkout page sometimes millions or
66:07 - billions of people hitting our checkout
66:09 - page where
66:11 - it will crash right but if you have
66:13 - millions of people hitting your checkout
66:15 - page
66:16 - and imagine it's not working
66:18 - how much will that cost kylie jenner
66:21 - a lot
66:23 - how much will that cost put up it will
66:25 - cost millions it will cost millions
66:28 - so let me ask you this would it make
66:30 - sense to have something that
66:32 - automatically tests that page constantly
66:35 - and it the second it ever goes down it
66:38 - alerts you
66:42 - right yeah what is that useful that's
66:44 - very useful i use i actually used it at
66:46 - uh an old company i used to work with um
66:50 - yeah they used you know they used all
66:52 - these different you know testing to make
66:54 - sure that and we've actually had a lot
66:55 - of times where you know literally at 5
66:58 - 00 p.m
66:59 - in at night we got an error whereas you
67:02 - know our payment was just wasn't working
67:04 - yeah and we were working on it from like
67:06 - 5 p.m till like 10 p.m yeah five hours
67:09 - straight like the developers were all
67:11 - just stuck didn't know what to do
67:13 - we had to figure out what was you know
67:15 - we know how to fix it yeah you know so
67:17 - yeah there's some you know that happens
67:19 - you know but it's important that we
67:21 - learn about it is faster than than later
67:24 - yes exactly i agree
67:27 - so yeah i mean there's tons of things uh
67:30 - so on the left hand side you have a
67:31 - testing thing called just on the top
67:33 - right you have cypress and you have
67:35 - mocha and you have selenium selenium is
67:37 - a popular one probably a lot of you have
67:39 - heard it uh they're all really good in
67:41 - their own way i think cyprus is really
67:43 - good for doing like where your mouse is
67:46 - moving and clicking things and opening
67:47 - things cyprus is pretty good for that
67:49 - just is really good for writing like
67:50 - unit tests so something to just keep in
67:53 - mind and again if you're a complete
67:54 - beginner right now you don't really need
67:56 - to worry that much about testing
67:57 - honestly you'll be fine it's just
68:00 - something to have on your roadmap that
68:01 - later you could learn it cool
68:04 - okay let's move on now you guys might be
68:07 - wondering hey how do i actually improve
68:09 - my front-end skills right like how do i
68:12 - what do i do next quasi no it's like how
68:14 - do i do it so there you go it's called
68:17 - no i'm just kidding
68:19 - so there are a couple of great resources
68:22 - here
68:24 - and one of the resources here is called
68:26 - dribble
68:27 - and this resource is really good for and
68:29 - it's dribble with three b's so that will
68:32 - throw you off guaranteed
68:35 - so i'm gonna repeat that it's dribble
68:36 - with three one two three b's so when you
68:39 - wanna type it in make sure you you
68:43 - find the right website
68:45 - and this website will have like modern
68:47 - designs websites
68:49 - and you can use these as inspiration to
68:51 - model something or build a new you know
68:53 - whether it's a portfolio or a new
68:55 - website you're building i think it's a
68:57 - really good idea
68:58 - okay
69:00 - so you could use this for inspiration so
69:03 - let's do that yeah and then not
69:04 - necessarily guys for like for copy you
69:06 - don't have to copy you know
69:08 - the actual website
69:10 - but you know i have done it where like i
69:12 - take you know i create something called
69:14 - a mood board so i take for example like
69:16 - you know one image another idea another
69:19 - idea and i just put a few things
69:20 - together and that creates like a unique
69:22 - style in itself right yes there's
69:24 - nothing wrong with that right the only
69:25 - way you can get an inspiration from it
69:27 - too exactly exactly that that that's you
69:30 - know so it's okay to do that that's
69:32 - that's what i want to say yeah yeah yeah
69:33 - that's smart yeah no yeah don't copy the
69:35 - exact thing that they have there but
69:37 - like you can use it to kind of model
69:39 - after it or get some inspiration after
69:41 - it or if you're gonna copy it you know
69:42 - you don't have to like make it a public
69:44 - thing you can just use it to practice
69:46 - and then keep it there and then
69:48 - modify it to be your own
69:51 - yes exactly cool so let's keep on
69:54 - rocking and rolling here so front end
69:56 - mentor okay this is another great
70:00 - service platform you can use it's
70:03 - it's free to use
70:06 - they have a paid version as well but
70:08 - most of you will be good on the free
70:11 - version most of you will be good on that
70:14 - and they're really good because you can
70:16 - pick so for example
70:18 - they even have it broken out by
70:20 - difficulty so here is a newbie project
70:23 - here is a junior project and here's an
70:26 - intermediate project
70:28 - right so you guys can go ahead and pick
70:32 - like a newbie one and it makes it really
70:35 - easy for you to follow it they'll even
70:36 - give you all the resources the graphics
70:39 - you might need and then you can try to
70:40 - make it look like that so they have
70:42 - interesting challenges you can do to
70:43 - improve your skill okay anybody here let
70:46 - me ask you guys this question a very
70:47 - serious question we ever just like tried
70:49 - to build a project and it looked like
70:51 - beep
70:53 - yeah not that great huh
70:56 - you know you're like i do not want to
70:58 - show this to my employer i don't know i
71:01 - want to show this to my mom or to my dad
71:03 - or to anybody you know you're proud of
71:05 - this that was great but you know you
71:07 - don't know how to show this this is
71:09 - where you know these companies do come
71:11 - in right
71:12 - they have designed these things for you
71:14 - because in the days developers sometimes
71:16 - we you know sometimes maybe we just
71:17 - don't want to design it right and so we
71:20 - sometimes maybe you just don't know how
71:22 - to design this kind of stuff but the
71:24 - more you
71:25 - learn from these designs the more you
71:27 - build it you kind of get a momentum on
71:29 - what it takes to build a website and
71:31 - then actually design just comes to you
71:33 - naturally after a certain point of time
71:36 - you just have to have to start building
71:38 - this and then you'll be building because
71:40 - imagine this if you build one project it
71:42 - looks amazing like for example you build
71:43 - one project from from the mentor now it
71:45 - looks amazing you're like holy moly i
71:47 - just done this would you be excited to
71:50 - build the second one
71:52 - yes or no yeah
71:55 - right yeah absolutely right and then you
71:57 - built that one and then would you be
71:58 - excited about the third one
72:00 - you're like wow looks so great yes you
72:03 - will of course right yeah so
72:06 - that's what we're trying to do here is
72:08 - you want to create the momentum and this
72:10 - will allow you to create a momentum not
72:12 - only for you to learn but to build
72:13 - beautiful products absolutely
72:15 - and by the way guys we're going to be
72:16 - giving homework at the end of the video
72:19 - or at the end of this training so stick
72:21 - around
72:23 - because that's going to be really
72:24 - important for you as you um compete in
