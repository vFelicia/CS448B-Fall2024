00:00 - hey guys what's up so this is part 2 of
00:02 - the learned command-line tutorial and
00:04 - before we get to running the Python
00:06 - script what I want to tell you guys is I
00:09 - want you to get comfortable with it a
00:11 - lot of the times when people start in
00:13 - the command line they think they're
00:14 - gonna break something and they're going
00:15 - to hit CDs so slowly an LS so slowly I
00:18 - want you to get so used to it as if it's
00:21 - like you're just moving around the room
00:23 - by yourself okay or moving around
00:26 - wherever just get comfortable with it
00:28 - feel it so essentially hit LS you're not
00:31 - gonna break anything hit CD hit tab like
00:33 - a million times if it doesn't work then
00:35 - you know do something hit tab hit CD
00:38 - again get back so get used to hitting
00:40 - these commands because you want to go
00:42 - from these commands being memorized from
00:44 - a book and trying to just always
00:46 - memorize and be like how did these
00:48 - people memorize these commands to making
00:51 - it like a feeling and an intuition okay
00:53 - you're not gonna break anything it's
00:55 - okay if you hit CD instead of PWD
00:58 - nothing bad is gonna happen
01:00 - okay so let's so seriously go practice
01:05 - that on this or your own computer
01:07 - wherever but just kind of have fun with
01:10 - it get used to going around then coming
01:12 - back home go deep in some directories
01:15 - and then come back home you know hit CD
01:17 - it's your safe place one more command I
01:20 - want to teach you guys right off the bat
01:22 - this one took me a while to learn but it
01:24 - was actually one of the most important
01:25 - so what if I go forward and I kind of
01:28 - want to just undo one step and just go
01:30 - back one step so let's say that um I
01:33 - enter no northern meadow but what I
01:36 - really meant to do was enter Western
01:38 - forest right so I can go see Dee
01:40 - northern meadow and then I'm like oh I
01:43 - don't want to go there I want to go back
01:45 - one step so I can do C D and I can do
01:48 - dot dot that means go one directory back
01:53 - so I went one directory back and now I'm
01:55 - in the comfort of my own home which is
01:58 - how it likes to state it now let me show
02:02 - you guys how you can use the command
02:04 - line to learn or run the Python script
02:06 - and as a matter of fact after this if
02:09 - you guys are going to my python tutorial
02:11 - still a
02:13 - only run the Python script like this
02:16 - okay how I am about to show you right
02:18 - now don't be using that idle stuff
02:21 - anymore that stuff was good when you
02:23 - were picking it up but now this is a
02:25 - better way to do it so for example okay
02:27 - let's write a Python script and let's
02:30 - put it on the right hand side and we can
02:33 - just open up a new snoo script here okay
02:35 - example or sorry print hello hi let's
02:42 - save it and let's go ahead and save it
02:45 - in clever programmer okay or actually I
02:51 - have a better director to save it here
02:53 - clever programmer save it here okay and
03:00 - let's save it in learn command line
03:11 - [Music]
03:13 - all right so I gave it the py extension
03:17 - now I'm gonna open up my terminal I'm
03:19 - going to put it on the right hand side
03:20 - that's how your workflow should actually
03:23 - look most of the times so let me make
03:26 - this big - all right so on the left hand
03:30 - side I got my terminal or sorry on my
03:32 - sublime text you guys can download the
03:35 - software it's free beautiful text editor
03:37 - write your code in there and on the
03:40 - right hand side is where you'll run it
03:42 - so let me show you a practical
03:43 - application of using the command line so
03:45 - we're going to go home so I just hit CD
03:48 - now I want to go to where that file was
03:51 - so I think it was in my Dropbox
03:53 - I'll hit LS again I'll look around me
03:56 - what's there
03:57 - I think github should be around me so
03:59 - I'm going to go to github I'll look
04:02 - around again and clever programmer is
04:05 - right there I can see it so I'll do CD
04:08 - clever programmer and then I will do CD
04:12 - clever programmer again I'm keep using I
04:14 - keep using tab to autocomplete for me
04:17 - now I'm here and I can see these
04:19 - directories I just made learn underscore
04:21 - command-line I'll go CD learn whoops
04:24 - because there are two of them that start
04:27 - with this it couldn't find it so I'm
04:29 - gonna do learn underscore C and then hit
04:31 - tab and it'll all look autocomplete it
04:33 - and I can see that file right there
04:35 - hello world under hello world a py so I
04:39 - will do Python hello we're all that py
04:42 - okay and let's run it and you can see
04:46 - that it says hello well if I wanted it
04:48 - to do for I in range one let's do 20
04:54 - print I okay let's go to the terminal
04:59 - now we don't need to type in that whole
05:02 - command anymore this is one of them very
05:04 - important features of the command line
05:06 - you can actually you don't have to type
05:07 - in Python hello world anymore just hit
05:10 - up and and hit enter okay so you see
05:14 - that it's added it added the new part of
05:17 - the code so it's printing on from 0 to
05:19 - 19 and just practice that a little bit
05:21 - hit up and enter up and enter up and
05:23 - enter up and enter okay kind of
05:25 - you get comfortable with that so you
05:29 - know let's let's make a change here
05:30 - maybe let's print done okay and save I'm
05:39 - gonna hit a command tap to switch to the
05:42 - terminal
05:42 - hit up and enter switch back write more
05:46 - code more code save hit command tab or
05:51 - alt tab if you're on the windows hit up
05:54 - and enter okay so that's how that works
05:57 - and the thing that I wanted to show you
05:58 - guys on Windows is basically just simply
06:03 - go and open up a new terminal or sorry a
06:07 - new tab and you can go get bash download
06:13 - and for for Windows just download this
06:17 - software okay it's called get bash and
06:19 - you should be able to download it pretty
06:20 - much from anywhere I think download kit
06:22 - for Windows and then that's it it
06:24 - started downloading automatically
06:26 - against my will which is not cool but um
06:29 - you know for you it might be helpful
06:31 - because if you have Windows you don't
06:32 - have to hit any buttons woah alright
06:36 - guys I hope you're starting to see the
06:37 - practicality the pragmatic nuts the
06:39 - awesomeness of the command-line and I'll
06:43 - see you in the next video
