00:00 - Sam Alman the founder of open Ai and
00:03 - Bill Gates sit down and have a
00:05 - conversation about Ai and chat GPT and
00:08 - these AI models and right before we jump
00:10 - into the reaction I do want to say that
00:12 - if you want to use Ai and chat GPT and
00:15 - learn how to make money with it I've put
00:17 - together a free 19-minute training below
00:19 - that shows you three app ideas that you
00:21 - could get started with today how to
00:22 - build apps with the I Chad GPT and do
00:24 - this even if you're a complete beginner
00:27 - this training will show you all
00:28 - completely free click the link below and
00:30 - sign up for the free training that said
00:32 - let's jump straight into the video right
00:33 - now I guess the we're looking a lot of
00:37 - productivity improvement from AI which
00:40 - you know that's overwhelmingly a very
00:42 - good thing which areas are you most
00:45 - excited about yeah so first of all I
00:47 - always think it's worth remembering that
00:48 - we're just sort of on this long
00:50 - continuous curve um so like right now we
00:53 - have an we have ai systems that can do
00:55 - tasks they certainly can't do jobs but
00:57 - they can do tasks and there's a
00:59 - productivity gain there
01:00 - eventually they'll be able to do more
01:02 - things that we think of like a job today
01:04 - um and so just some clarity there I
01:07 - think tasks
01:09 - are fix this specific coding bug job is
01:14 - be a developer for the company Chad GPT
01:17 - can't be a developer for the company
01:19 - right now it can't like think for you
01:22 - and do things for you automatically on
01:24 - its own it needs to be constantly
01:26 - prompted and assigned tasks that's kind
01:29 - of what you do when you have like an
01:30 - intern at your company you give them
01:32 - tasks but then when you have somebody
01:35 - who's a full-time employee and can take
01:38 - over a lot of the responsibility that's
01:40 - a job well of course find new jobs and
01:43 - better jobs and I totally believe that
01:45 - if you give people way more powerful
01:47 - tools it's not just they can work a
01:49 - little faster they can do qualitatively
01:50 - different things and so you know right
01:53 - now maybe we can speed up a programmer
01:54 - 3x is about what we see I me that's one
01:56 - of the categories that we're most
01:57 - excited about it's it's working super
01:59 - super well but if you make a programmer
02:01 - three times more effective it's not just
02:03 - that they can write they can do three
02:04 - times more stuff it's that they can at
02:06 - that higher level of abstraction using
02:09 - more of their brain power they can now
02:10 - think of totally different things and
02:12 - this is nothing new think when we used
02:14 - to code an assembly
02:16 - low-level
02:18 - language you would be typing bits and
02:20 - btes and memories and allocation and
02:24 - right then you get higher level
02:25 - programming languages Python and you
02:27 - think at a completely different level
02:29 - because
02:30 - all the lowlevel work is
02:32 - abstracted now think at a company
02:35 - level when the CEO doesn't have to be
02:38 - the engineer and the customer support
02:39 - and all these other things the CEO can
02:42 - think of a big vision and get everybody
02:44 - behind it think of Steve Jobs think of
02:46 - Bill Gates so the higher level you go
02:49 - the more abstract your thinking becomes
02:52 - and the more things you can attack and
02:54 - that's what he's saying so these
02:56 - Concepts should be nothing new these
02:58 - should logically make sense to all of
03:00 - you hopefully and it's like you know
03:02 - going from Punch Cards to higher level
03:03 - languages didn't just let us program a
03:06 - little faster let us do these
03:07 - qualitatively new things and we're we're
03:10 - really seeing that and so as we look at
03:12 - these next steps of things that can do a
03:14 - more complete task you can like imagine
03:16 - a little agent that you can say go write
03:18 - this whole program for me I'll ask you a
03:20 - few questions along the way but it won't
03:22 - just be writing a few functions at a
03:23 - time that'll enable a bunch of new stuff
03:26 - uh and then again it'll do even more
03:28 - complex stuff some maybe there's an AI
03:30 - where you can say you know go start and
03:32 - run this company for me and then someday
03:34 - there's maybe an AI where you can say
03:35 - like go discover new
03:37 - physics this is where Alex heroi talks
03:41 - about I don't know if you guys know him
03:43 - but he's an entrepreneur he's jacked and
03:45 - he kind of blew up overnight so you can
03:47 - look him up but he talks about the more
03:51 - advanced and valuable somebody is the
03:52 - more General tasks you can give them and
03:55 - basically the Dumber somebody is you can
03:57 - only give them you give them very
04:00 - specific tasks for example if you have
04:03 - somebody really valuable you would just
04:05 - go and tell them hey start me a $10
04:06 - million company tomorrow and that guy
04:09 - can go and figure that out and do it for
04:11 - you right uh like for example if you
04:14 - could hire Steve Jobs or Bill Gates how
04:17 - easily could they start a brand new
04:18 - company that would be worth a couple of
04:20 - million dollars probably very easy for
04:22 - them right or Elon
04:23 - Musk but then you take somebody who's
04:27 - kind of Dumber I don't know how else to
04:30 - say it right but this is that's just how
04:31 - I say it somebody who's Dumber you would
04:34 - have to tell them like press this button
04:35 - to actually turn on your computer or
04:37 - less skill let's say right you have to
04:39 - be like press this button to run this ad
04:42 - you have to get very microscopically
04:45 - specific and that's how it is with Chad
04:47 - GPT right now we have to be pretty
04:49 - specific with the scope it'll be like
04:51 - I'm sorry I don't understand but then in
04:53 - future hopefully you can say things like
04:55 - discover new physics or
04:57 - go start a new company on your behalf
05:01 - and then it should be able to do it all
05:02 - for
05:03 - you and it's the stuff that we're seeing
05:07 - now is very exciting and wonderful uh
05:09 - but I think it's worth always putting in
05:11 - context of this technology
05:13 - that at least for the next five or 10
05:16 - years will be on a very steep
05:17 - Improvement curve um these are the
05:19 - stupidest the models will ever be but
05:21 - coding is probably the area the single
05:23 - area from a productivity gain we're most
05:25 - excited about today uh massively
05:28 - deployed and you know it's SC usage at
05:30 - this point Healthcare and education are
05:32 - two things that are coming up that curve
05:33 - that we're very excited about too but
05:35 - the thing that's that is a little
05:37 - daunting is unlike previous technology
05:41 - improvements this one could improve very
05:45 - rapidly and there's kind of no upper
05:48 - bound I mean the idea that it achieves
05:51 - human levels on a lot of areas of work
05:54 - you know even if it's not doing unique
05:57 - science it you know can do support calls
06:00 - and sales calls I guess you and I do
06:03 - have some concern along with this good
06:06 - thing that it'll Force us to
06:09 - adapt faster than we've had to ever
06:13 - before that that's the scary part it's
06:15 - not that we have to adapt it's not that
06:18 - humanity is not super adaptable we've
06:20 - been through these massive technological
06:22 - shifts and a massive percentage of the
06:25 - jobs that people do can change over a
06:27 - couple of generations and over couple of
06:29 - generations we seem to absorb that just
06:32 - fine yeah so it's not so much we'll
06:35 - we'll adapt and we'll find ways to adapt
06:38 - but Bill Gates is right this is never
06:40 - happened before this level of Technology
06:43 - things that can think and improve on
06:44 - their own for example when you figured
06:47 - out how to have electricity in a house
06:51 - that's quite different right once
06:53 - electricity happened in the house that
06:56 - was it it was done right it wasn't like
06:58 - electricity kept improving its own self
07:01 - automatically whereas that will happen
07:03 - with AI where the more it trains on data
07:05 - the smarter it becomes automatically so
07:09 - it's going to kind of have an
07:10 - exponential weird curve of improvement
07:13 - versus a lot of other things however Sam
07:15 - is like yo we've seen improvements and
07:18 - we've seen crazy big shifts so humans
07:20 - will find a way to adapt I'm curious
07:22 - what he's going to say next I just want
07:23 - to comment on the point he made about
07:26 - coding yes coding is very exciting today
07:29 - and as much as you hear me say or other
07:31 - people say end of programming it might
07:33 - not be 5 to 10 years from now and even
07:35 - when we say end of programming it really
07:37 - might be the end of traditional coding
07:40 - jobs and how they look where you have
07:43 - software developers sitting there
07:44 - writing code it's going to morph into
07:46 - you becoming a project manager or a
07:50 - product manager who's going to be
07:52 - writing to AI to build things and you're
07:55 - going to be overseeing it like you have
07:57 - a bunch of Junior developers under you
07:58 - and then when there bugs you might go
08:00 - and check it out and see what what's
08:02 - happening but the bugs are going to be
08:04 - start being less and less likely as time
08:07 - goes on as it starts to get better and
08:09 - even debugging it might actually not be
08:11 - you coding debugging it might be giving
08:13 - it instructions and letting it debug hey
08:16 - why did you start it on port 8080 you
08:18 - should have started on Port 7000 hey why
08:21 - were using mongod
08:23 - DB we needed to use you to use Firebase
08:26 - for this you know that that level of
08:28 - debugging kind like you would when
08:30 - you're interacting with the developer so
08:33 - coding is an exciting time you should
08:35 - still learn it it's incredibly valuable
08:38 - but start using these AI tools and Chad
08:40 - GPT tools that exist we've seen that
08:43 - with the great technological Revolutions
08:45 - of the past each technological
08:47 - revolution has gotten faster and this
08:49 - will be the fastest by far and that's
08:52 - the part that I find potentially a
08:54 - little scary is that's what I was
08:55 - talking about where this is a technology
08:57 - Revolution that will be the fastest
09:00 - adding electricity wasn't that like it
09:02 - got added and then the incremental
09:04 - improvement from there to something else
09:05 - was not as fast right you had fire and
09:09 - then after fire I don't know whatever
09:10 - else happened then you got electricity
09:13 - but it was like it took a while to have
09:15 - that happen whereas Chad GPT 4 like
09:18 - three and four is like 10 20 50 times
09:21 - better like GPT 4 is incomparably better
09:24 - to gpt3 gpt3 just looks completely
09:27 - stupid compared to it
09:29 - gpt3 looks like a 10-year-old and GPT 4
09:32 - looks like a 29y old and the difference
09:35 - between a 10-year-old and 29y old in
09:37 - terms of intelligence usually isn't like
09:38 - two times or five times it's like 80
09:41 - times 100 times the difference is really
09:43 - really
09:45 - wild just the speed with which society
09:49 - is going to have to adapt and that the
09:50 - labor market will change one aspect uh
09:53 - of AI is is robotics or blue collar jobs
09:58 - when you get you sort of hands and feet
10:02 - uh that are at human level capability
10:04 - and you know the incredible chat GPT
10:08 - breakthrough has kind of gotten us
10:10 - focused on the white thank you for not
10:11 - saying Chad GTP I mean how many of you
10:15 - watching this Chad say Chad GTP like
10:17 - what the [ __ ] is that who started that
10:20 - like why are there so many like majority
10:22 - of the people say GTP I don't understand
10:25 - thank you Bill Gates for saying it right
10:27 - caller thing which is super appropriate
10:30 - but I do worry people are losing the
10:33 - focus on the blue collar piece so how do
10:35 - you see robotics super excited for that
10:38 - we started robots too early um and so we
10:41 - had to put that project on hold it was
10:43 - hard for the wrong reasons it wasn't
10:45 - helping us make progress with the
10:47 - difficult parts of the ml research and
10:50 - you know we were like dealing with bad
10:51 - simulators and breaking tendons and
10:53 - things like that and also we realized
10:56 - more and more over time that what we
10:57 - really first needed was intelligence and
11:00 - cognition and then we could figure out
11:01 - how to adapt it to physicality and it
11:03 - was easier to start with that with the
11:05 - way we've built these language models
11:07 - but we have I never thought about that
11:09 - that's actually really smart yeah cuz
11:11 - you end up wasting time on building the
11:13 - robot back up because he broke his
11:14 - freaking arm instead of working on the
11:17 - actual thinking of the robot and so huh
11:21 - that's why they decided not to do robots
11:23 - and just focus on the intelligence and
11:24 - cognition part very cool always planned
11:27 - to come back to it we've started
11:29 - investing a little bit in robotics
11:30 - companies I think on the physical
11:32 - Hardware side there's finally for the
11:34 - first time that I've ever seen really
11:36 - exciting new platforms being built there
11:39 - and at some point we will be able to use
11:42 - our models as you were saying with their
11:45 - language understanding and future video
11:46 - understanding to say all right like
11:48 - let's do amazing things with a with a
11:51 - robot but it's the hardware guys you
11:54 - know who've done a good job on legs
11:55 - actually get the arms hands fingers
11:59 - piece and then we couple it you know and
12:01 - it's not ridiculously
12:03 - expensive that could change the job
12:06 - market for a lot of the the blue collar
12:09 - type work pretty rapidly certainly the
12:12 - the prediction like the consensus
12:14 - prediction if we rewind seven or 10
12:16 - years was that the impact was going to
12:18 - be blue colar work first white colar
12:21 - work second creativity maybe never but
12:23 - certainly last cuz that was magic and
12:25 - human obviously it's gone exactly the
12:26 - other direction and I think there's like
12:29 - a lot of interesting takeaways about why
12:31 - that happened you know creative work act
12:33 - ah interesting so it was like creativity
12:37 - would be the last thing and now
12:39 - creativity is the first thing being
12:41 - taken away interesting because a lot of
12:42 - people you see using Chad GPT right now
12:44 - will use it to write their emails we'll
12:46 - use it to send messages to people we'll
12:49 - use it
12:50 - to um come up with content ideas and so
12:55 - if you think about it it's actually a
12:56 - lot of creative work creative thinking
12:58 - that we kind of assigning to Chad GPT
13:00 - which is interesting I didn't actually
13:01 - think about it like that even when I'm
13:03 - brainstorming with Chad GPT often times
13:05 - it's very deliberate like hard decision
13:09 - making and thinking and I'm having a
13:11 - back and
13:12 - forth interesting and so if but
13:16 - eventually once it turns into Robotics
13:18 - and gets physicality then it'll start to
13:20 - take over you know Constructor
13:24 - construction working jobs which will be
13:27 - a hard thing to achieve physicality wise
13:30 - and cognitive wise and all of that for
13:32 - it to achieve I don't think that's
13:33 - happening anytime soon I would I might
13:38 - have to guess like 10 years 20 years um
13:41 - who knows it might happen soon and blow
13:43 - my mind but I just feel like that's
13:44 - really
13:45 - complex cuz if you even look at Tesla
13:48 - right the car can barely drive itself
13:50 - like it runs into crashes and has bugs
13:54 - right people have died because of that
13:56 - and so to have things that are creating
13:59 - buildings you don't want to make a
14:00 - mistake there right and then the
14:02 - building breaks down and it endangers so
14:05 - many people's lives so very curious
14:07 - about that but very interesting that the
14:09 - blue collar jobs will be the last ones
14:11 - kind of Taken actually the
14:13 - hallucinations of the the GPT models is
14:16 - a is a feature not a bug it lets you
14:18 - discover some new things whereas if
14:19 - you're you know having a robot move
14:21 - heavy machinery around you better be
14:23 - really precise with that and I think
14:25 - this is just a case of you've got to
14:27 - follow where technology go and you have
14:29 - preconceptions but sometimes the science
14:32 - doesn't want to go that way interesting
14:35 - so instead of making your own
14:36 - assumptions it's better to see where
14:39 - technolog is actually going and just
14:41 - follow the science step by step rather
14:43 - than I think this is what's going to
14:44 - happen because that might change because
14:46 - people thought robots would happen first
14:48 - well it's ch GPT happening first which
14:50 - is interesting because like I would
14:52 - think it'd be easier to make a robot
14:54 - that goes and does stuff for you right
14:56 - brings you cake or some [ __ ] but
14:58 - apparently
14:59 - it was easier to invent this thing that
15:01 - could solve any [ __ ] problem like
15:03 - what like I would that's crazy like if
15:07 - you think about Chad GPT I mean now
15:08 - we're kind of normalized to it but it's
15:11 - insane and I was thinking we would have
15:14 - a robot that would bring me freaking
15:17 - water and so it's going the other way
15:20 - and so that's the way that we should
15:21 - actually look at it from but yes this is
15:23 - the stupidest these models will ever be
15:25 - so if you find that interesting at any
15:28 - level and you want to be like yo how can
15:31 - I use chat GPT and and how can I use
15:34 - these tools to learn how to build apps
15:37 - learn how to make money with it any of
15:39 - these things if any of that makes you
15:41 - interested or even slightly curious I
15:43 - have a 19-minute short free training for
15:45 - you below in the description go check it
15:47 - out because in that training we're going
15:49 - to go through and talk about Chad GPT
15:51 - we're going to talk about AI we're going
15:53 - to talk about the three app ideas that
15:55 - you could build and even if you're a
15:59 - complete beginner this training will fit
16:01 - you and even if you're a developer this
16:04 - will help you so it's 19 minutes of pure
16:06 - value click the link in the description
16:08 - join the training I'd love to see you
16:09 - inside with that said I hope you enjoyed
16:11 - the video peace
