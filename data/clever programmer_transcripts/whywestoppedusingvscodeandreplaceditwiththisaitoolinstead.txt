00:00 - we stopped using visual studio code and
00:03 - we replaced it with this tool and I know
00:07 - this is a controversial title and you're
00:09 - going to be like oh my God kaz's back
00:11 - with the clickbaits I know
00:14 - you're going to be mad at us you're
00:15 - going to be Nas kzy what the are
00:18 - you guys talking about I don't believe
00:20 - you but but just listen up I will'll
00:24 - show you too I'm going to screens share
00:25 - in a second and we'll share all of this
00:27 - stuff with you but I just want to give
00:28 - you context
00:30 - Nas is a real senior developer okay Nas
00:36 - when you discovered
00:37 - this this is something you yourself are
00:40 - finding yourself using every single day
00:42 - I don't use views code anymore that at
00:45 - all right yes um and the funniest thing
00:48 - that happened was is actually came out
00:50 - of like a few Instagram reels that we
00:52 - made yes so one of the problems I faced
00:54 - was I have a lot of code in my code base
00:58 - and I constantly find myself giving that
01:00 - context to AI like Chad GPT so Chad GPT
01:02 - or Claude can work with me yeah so I
01:05 - ended up creating a script that would go
01:08 - through my code base Clump everything
01:10 - together and then I could take that txt
01:12 - file that had all the code M drop that
01:16 - into Claude or chpt and then go hey
01:19 - write me this new feature like login or
01:22 - authentication that was taking a lot of
01:24 - time and you made a reel on that and
01:26 - that reel actually blew up it got like
01:28 - half a million views yes yeah that real
01:30 - got crazy views because people wanted
01:32 - because I realized it wasn't just me
01:34 - other people had the same problem and
01:35 - they kept having to give all that
01:37 - context um and so when I posted that
01:41 - reel what people started recommending
01:44 - was they started recommending this other
01:46 - magical IDE and some of you guys
01:49 - probably already know it and then they
01:50 - started recommending they're like hey
01:52 - use this other thing that already has AI
01:55 - built in and my first question was why
01:57 - wouldn't I just use co-pilot because
01:59 - that's integrated inside
02:01 - of 99% of you guys probably do use copal
02:05 - at this point yes and you probably use
02:08 - it to its fullest extent and you
02:11 - probably are seeing the limitations of
02:14 - it you're trying to for example write
02:17 - some code right or you're trying to ask
02:19 - copal to write you some code but the
02:21 - problem I be you might be facing is well
02:24 - it doesn't know the full context of your
02:26 - code right and that was one of the
02:29 - biggest issues I personally had and
02:31 - that's why I also always had to copy the
02:36 - whole file from one you know the whole
02:38 - file copy another file copy another file
02:40 - into the whole CPT context give it to
02:43 - chpt and then ask a questions and that
02:45 - was extremely tedious man yes but then
02:49 - you showed me this tool and everything
02:51 - for me changed yes and it was the
02:53 - comments that actually shared it with us
02:54 - okay so they talked about this tool and
02:56 - it's called cursor IDE yes and this Tool
03:01 - uh if I show it to you it will look this
03:04 - it looks like um this is not a sponsored
03:07 - video or anything like that no not
03:08 - sponsor we just love the tool so much
03:11 - and we want to share with you with as
03:13 - many people as possible yeah just
03:15 - because it's like why not we want you
03:17 - guys to be become better coders better
03:20 - developers hence you make better code
03:22 - overall so yeah yeah and this is
03:24 - something we just started using and
03:26 - maybe maybe co-pilot works better than
03:29 - this I have no idea I just I
03:32 - switched to this and I I've just been
03:34 - kind of mind blown
03:35 - so um first of all it looks a lot like
03:38 - Visual Studio code if you're looking at
03:40 - it because it was forked from Visual
03:42 - Studio code and then they're built on
03:44 - top of it um and my favorite things is
03:47 - like I can just write code like directly
03:50 - within here so for example if I'm like
03:53 - hey um you know like let's say that I
03:56 - want to just take this guy and I want to
03:58 - wrap it in a TR catch because for some
04:00 - reason this debounce code fails I just
04:03 - grab that I hit command K and I'll just
04:06 - say wrap this in a tri catch for example
04:09 - and I'll hit enter and within this it
04:11 - will write it and it's already showing
04:14 - me what has changed so the red is it's
04:16 - deleted the edit node and the update
04:18 - node dimensional lines M and then the
04:21 - green is the new stuff that it's added
04:22 - and now if I want to accept it I just
04:24 - hit accept so it does that brilliantly
04:26 - well I do not know if co-pilot does that
04:28 - it might it does does it does that part
04:30 - of does okay great so maybe you do not
04:34 - need to use this at all I will just say
04:37 - that okay I've just been stuck on using
04:40 - this and it blows my mind how
04:42 - well it operates have you used co-pilot
04:46 - heavily like but this in this style in
04:48 - this style I have used co-pilot where
04:51 - this becomes very different is actually
04:54 - the part that's on the right side of the
04:57 - on the right side that you see here on
04:58 - the chat so if if you look at the chat
05:00 - here on the right that's something that
05:02 - copal just completely misses like if you
05:05 - want something to you know copal to
05:07 - write something you have to use special
05:09 - key to actually write it and the biggest
05:11 - problem is it it just does not know the
05:13 - full context now the cool part here is
05:17 - let's just say here so we have this edit
05:19 - node function so you can maybe highlight
05:20 - that right y right here yep edit node
05:23 - and the edit note is coming from a
05:25 - specific file so go called nodes context
05:28 - so click on the edit node here uhhuh
05:30 - awesome see use nodes and edges
05:32 - beautiful yep and that's coming from
05:33 - Context no edges cont exactly so let's
05:36 - just say we want to change something up
05:37 - in here and we want to say hey um
05:40 - instead of using edit node use create
05:42 - node because we we have a create node
05:43 - function inside use node and edges so
05:46 - what we do uhhuh so it's actually inside
05:49 - the use noes create edges there's a
05:50 - create node function okay yeah so if you
05:52 - click into that use create nodes scroll
05:55 - up up up up up up and then there's
05:57 - create note right right there cool yep
05:59 - awesome awesome so let's just say start
06:01 - of editing a node we want to create the
06:02 - node so how will we use CHP or copile
06:05 - usually you have to like reference the
06:07 - one file then reference another file now
06:11 - with this this is so different let's go
06:13 - back to the text node go back to the
06:15 - text node command P awesome and then the
06:17 - right hit that little plus icon awesome
06:20 - and so what we want to say is the
06:21 - following is like um use right use and
06:26 - then hit at oh yeah the ad is pretty
06:28 - sick co-pilot have that no that's what
06:30 - go ad is sick dude I can write
06:33 - like if I I can literally write a
06:35 - function name here and it will auto
06:37 - complete and if I hit enter it's
06:38 - referencing that exact function EXA
06:41 - exactly you can reference a function you
06:42 - can reference a file you can reference a
06:44 - folder but then hit that ad again uhhuh
06:47 - you can reference a piece of code you
06:49 - can even reference the web you can even
06:51 - reference the docs there's even like oh
06:53 - dude you know what I do yes I actually
06:55 - reference the get diff oh yeah to
06:57 - actually write the the diff in the thing
06:59 - so I go with the diff of working State
07:01 - and I go use this to write my commit
07:04 - message yes and I'll hit enter and it'll
07:06 - actually look at the diff of what's
07:08 - changed and then it'll use that to write
07:10 - the get that's crazy but anyway Sor
07:13 - that's so cool that's like Co pet is has
07:15 - talked about actually end that feature
07:17 - but like it's just they have not
07:18 - released it at all yet so and and by the
07:21 - way um Chad gbt an open ey doesn't
07:25 - endorse companies and invest in them but
07:27 - they are actually investing in this is
07:29 - one
07:30 - the which is kind of crazy yeah keep
07:33 - going I'm sorry I keep interrupting no
07:34 - no it's okay it's okay this is great
07:35 - stuff guys so this is one of the big use
07:37 - use cases right is like using git
07:40 - functionality to get like the git diff
07:42 - maybe let's just say you want to do this
07:43 - is diff of the working state right which
07:45 - is the working state of the thing
07:46 - awesome so let's just say you made some
07:48 - changes and you want to be able to get a
07:49 - diff of that so you can add it to your
07:51 - pull request this is what you will get
07:53 - the second thing is let's go back to the
07:56 - functionality we're talking about which
07:57 - is use uhhuh at and let's use the nodes
08:01 - and edges
08:03 - context yeah boom boom cool and great
08:07 - and
08:10 - replace edit node inside
08:14 - debounce edit node uh just say edit node
08:18 - I understand I understand edit node
08:20 - inside inside debound with create
08:23 - node create node should I reference the
08:26 - actual create node uh it should kind of
08:29 - know yeah yeah yeah because we've
08:30 - already given it contct yeah let's hope
08:32 - it does now and then there's two things
08:34 - here right so maybe want to explain what
08:36 - is this stuff on the bottom right here
08:37 - so if you can maybe like do boom Oh
08:40 - don't don't function oh there we go this
08:44 - stuff here no no no like GPT for all
08:46 - mention image all that stuff oh yeah so
08:49 - for example like um I can add in an
08:52 - image if I wanted to M and if I actually
08:54 - hit command enter it will go through the
08:58 - entire code Bas so then you don't have
09:00 - to do that script that I made manually
09:03 - that I would feed GPT all the time so
09:05 - you can command enter and sometimes it
09:07 - could show you like the code you need to
09:08 - add to five different files yes and then
09:10 - you hit apply and then it starts adding
09:12 - it to five different files but okay so
09:14 - continue with the example do you want me
09:16 - to hit enter at this point or what do
09:17 - you want me just hit uh yeah just go
09:19 - ahead and hit enter at this point okay
09:20 - so I'll hit enter and now it's starting
09:22 - to do its
09:24 - generation and boom there it is right
09:27 - uhhuh and that's it so it tolds you here
09:30 - to replace a te a text node make sure to
09:32 - create the create node blah blah blah
09:35 - and then if you hit apply you see on the
09:37 - bottom says apply yep so I'll hit apply
09:39 - here and then it'll start applying it to
09:41 - this boom done now create note is coming
09:44 - through create note create not you know
09:46 - what's sick yeah so I love this
09:48 - I'll tell you actually um if do you want
09:50 - to expand on this no go ahead Okay cool
09:52 - so I'll share this with you so this is
09:54 - an amazing use case of it and this
09:56 - reminded me of like similar use case
09:58 - that I actually had today so I wanted to
10:00 - create a new node for articles right so
10:02 - like for example like if we go to um
10:05 - we're not open
10:07 - on
10:09 - uh cell. apppp okay so let's see if I
10:13 - can open this here real quick so we have
10:20 - um is this fine to share sure okay cool
10:25 - so this and this okay so we have
10:28 - different types of nodes uh in our app
10:30 - right now right we have the um uh this
10:34 - is the the code that we have is for this
10:36 - app this app that we're building called
10:38 - popy AI yes
10:41 - PL and so we have like different types
10:43 - of nodes like we have um stuff that can
10:47 - handle YouTube videos stuff that can
10:48 - handle Loom videos so for example like
10:51 - if I go ahead here and I paste uh what's
10:55 - your uh command V what's your clipboard
10:59 - oh um can you do it yep option command V
11:02 - there okay so let's go
11:04 - youtube.com and if I go to some kind of
11:07 - a YouTube video a YouTube video and I
11:10 - paste this like Alex Orosi video for
11:12 - example yep um what's going to happen is
11:14 - it's going to paste this node right so
11:16 - this is an example of a YouTube node and
11:18 - I want to I wanted to create a similar
11:21 - node MH but for article and if we
11:24 - actually follow the logic of this
11:25 - YouTube node it's actually like quite
11:28 - involved so I'll give you an example so
11:30 - like for example let's say I go here and
11:31 - I
11:32 - go tell me how the YouTube node works
11:37 - because it's not like the code is in one
11:39 - file it's the code is across like many
11:42 - different files and it's kind of
11:43 - complicated as a developer for me to
11:45 - wrap my mind around it so I just hit
11:47 - command enter so it could go through
11:49 - like the entire code base yeah and it
11:51 - will go through and it'll tell me like
11:53 - hey I actually have one YouTube
11:56 - nodejs file MH then the next thing I
11:59 - actually have on the top it says on the
12:02 - top there we go yeah so I have um my
12:06 - YouTube node right I'm using my light
12:09 - YouTube embed it's not actually walking
12:11 - me
12:12 - through walk me through MH how it's also
12:16 - being
12:19 - registered uh how paste is being handled
12:23 - Etc oh wait hold on command space yeah
12:26 - yeah yeah so I'm going to cancel
12:27 - generation and I'm going to command
12:29 - command enter and so just going to go
12:31 - through all of it yeah this this is
12:34 - where by the way it adds all the context
12:35 - from all the files yes so now this is
12:38 - really important for me right so first
12:39 - it told me hey look this is the
12:42 - definition of like YouTube node and
12:44 - that's chilling in your YouTube node is
12:45 - here so cool I can go here and I can see
12:48 - how this YouTube node is working great
12:50 - yeah next is telling me hey when you do
12:52 - that paste thing that you did that's
12:55 - actually coming from handle YouTube
12:58 - paste so this is the code that checks if
13:01 - the pattern matches a YouTube video or a
13:04 - YouTube short and then it goes and hits
13:07 - our backend yep gets the transcript
13:09 - right gets the transcript um and then it
13:12 - pastes that and then it even tells me
13:14 - hey to registered this YouTube node in
13:17 - our nodes context and edges we're
13:19 - actually registering our YouTube yep
13:23 - sorry noes context uh edges and context
13:27 - and then type node types node
13:31 - types it's here that's weird huh node
13:35 - types just context the
13:39 - bottom there we go that's weird the
13:42 - command F was cuz I think you were doing
13:44 - YouTube oh unchecked this ah case
13:48 - sensitive okay cool cool cool so there
13:51 - we go so now it's showing me exactly how
13:54 - it's working right so when I actually
13:56 - want to add a new note so now let's say
13:58 - I want to go hey I want to create an
14:00 - article node meaning like if I take an
14:02 - article like a link from a website and I
14:05 - paste it it should be able to detect the
14:08 - pattern yep it should be able to make it
14:10 - similar to the YouTube node look at how
14:13 - the logic workers Works across five
14:15 - different files and make something very
14:17 - similar for me cook all of that up yep
14:19 - so then I go make me this but for an
14:24 - article
14:25 - node make sure to follow all the steps
14:30 - of how the YouTube node works just
14:33 - replicate that and now I'll just hit
14:34 - command enter And even though I won't do
14:36 - a perfect job and get it all set up it
14:39 - will get me going in a very good
14:42 - direction so when I was setting it up
14:44 - actually this is looking like the
14:46 - correct code because I have it already
14:47 - set up I just didn't push it yet yeah
14:49 - yeah yeah and so oh get push get push
14:51 - main Force push yeah so it's like I got
14:54 - my article node good to go yeah it's
14:58 - telling me that this is how I can
15:00 - register this nice that's exactly by the
15:02 - way just so you guys know for context
15:05 - when we talk about like registering so
15:06 - if you can hover over that register
15:08 - stuff the not type stuff right so how
15:11 - that works by the way is because we use
15:13 - a tool called react flow um and you need
15:15 - to register every single type of
15:17 - component right so if you look at the
15:18 - YouTube node there's like there's audio
15:21 - node and so forth you have to register
15:22 - it here and then it knows how to connect
15:25 - the dots between the actual react
15:27 - component and then what is saved in
15:29 - database so it tells me that I need to
15:31 - register that um and then what it does
15:35 - is it's also telling me hey this is how
15:39 - handle articles that so good right
15:42 - because it's looking crazy good it's
15:43 - looking at the YouTube handle paste and
15:45 - how the YouTube is handling its paste
15:47 - and so it's going and it's going okay
15:49 - here's how we're going to handle the
15:50 - paste for articles and then it goes and
15:54 - adds that to the global handle paste
15:57 - where're routing in YouTube and then it
16:00 - throws that in there which is where you
16:01 - really hated it initially yeah exactly
16:04 - like I'm like what the is this and
16:05 - so now I can actually even um you know
16:08 - so for example like right now if I
16:11 - actually hit apply yeah it'll
16:13 - automatically take me to this nodes and
16:15 - edges file and apply this particular
16:18 - change wow um and for these other ones
16:21 - the reason why it's not letting me apply
16:23 - right away it's cuz those files don't
16:24 - exist create those files uh and then if
16:26 - I obviously don't want this change I
16:28 - just go no hit reject the full on the
16:30 - top yeah but then so this stuff I'm not
16:34 - sure if you could do it
16:36 - in let's say I'm not sure if you could
16:39 - do this in co-pilot I honestly I I'll be
16:43 - honest I haven't even looked that deeply
16:44 - into co-pilot you guys might actually
16:46 - tell me that you can do all of this and
16:48 - more and maybe I'll check it out and
16:50 - maybe we're the ones who suck and don't
16:51 - know what the we're talking about
16:52 - that's possible yeah but so far cursor
16:55 - ID has blown my goddamn mind with how
16:58 - well works and I'm just such a power
17:02 - user of it and like the things I can do
17:04 - like I don't know if co- pilot has this
17:06 - where you can iterate over stuff yeah
17:09 - like does co-pilot have that so for
17:11 - example like let's say I um you know go
17:16 - to which one were we in at the start
17:20 - which one oh the text node we were I
17:21 - think in here right yes so now like
17:23 - let's say I have it in a TR catch yeah
17:27 - and let's say I want to go here I'm just
17:29 - going to say console log key moments
17:32 - with Emojis or actually I'll say console
17:35 - log key moments right and if I hit enter
17:38 - it'll like run it and then you can
17:40 - actually like stack this so now I can
17:43 - add a followup instruction I actually
17:46 - add it with Emojis yeah beautiful yeah I
17:49 - like that and then it'll keep everything
17:51 - had and then it'll build on top of it
17:54 - yeah it doesn't it's it's not as clean
17:57 - in like and you can go stack so deep
18:00 - there are times where I'm like TW like
18:02 - not 20 but like five or eight followup
18:05 - instructions deep crazy that's crazy and
18:07 - it's so valuable cuz you iteratively
18:09 - build it out and it doesn't lose
18:11 - anything that it had oh I'm sorry I'm
18:12 - sorry they weren't seeing any of that so
18:14 -  here so like this is what I did I
18:16 - said console log key moments yeah and
18:19 - then it added the console logs and then
18:21 - I said actually add emojis then it went
18:24 - back and then it added the Emojis mhm um
18:27 - you know I can also say like
18:29 - add an emoji at the end just so
18:31 - everybody could see it and if I hit
18:33 - enter it'll go ahead and then like it
18:36 - had the instructions of add an emoji
18:38 - before before yeah for some is not
18:40 - adding it now um at the end of the at
18:44 - the end of the console log add it at the
18:46 - end of the console log as well okay
18:51 - yeah all breaks and demos
18:54 - hey okay there we go there we go now
18:56 - it's awesome cool so it's like it
18:58 - iteratively like Stacks it yeah but
19:01 - what's really also really cool is the
19:03 - fact that I don't know if that's
19:05 - possible here but I mean it was here um
19:08 - is let's just say you do uh accept right
19:12 - just for a second here and let's we do
19:13 - command K as well so I just want to show
19:15 - it to you really quickly the other part
19:17 - that's really cool is um again you know
19:20 - there's a ways you can go through
19:21 - different histories which is awesome
19:22 - which is what you did maybe you've done
19:23 - before oh I didn't know that yeah or you
19:26 - can also do you can also ask a question
19:27 - like a quick question so for example
19:29 - like tell me like how this works yeah
19:32 - why we need debound here you know and so
19:37 - to ask a question option enter option
19:39 - enter and so it's not going to actually
19:40 - change the code because sometimes you
19:42 - don't need to change the code you just
19:43 - want to understand fully why you know
19:46 - it's doing what it's doing and it's
19:47 - explaining to me hey the bonance is used
19:49 - here to limit the frequency of edit node
19:50 - and update node Dimensions blah blah
19:52 - blah right makes complete sense but it
19:55 - gets even better because you know you
19:58 - have the ability to change the actual
20:00 - GPT models maybe it's GPT 40 GPT 4
20:03 - there's even a way you can actually use
20:05 - CLA as well yeah so they have
20:07 - Integrations with claw to on top of GPT
20:10 - 40 and I imagine some point they might
20:12 - even use gem if they wanted to as well
20:14 - so you can add your own models to you
20:15 - can add your own models as well so it's
20:17 - so it's just so um how dynamic in terms
20:21 - of what you can do with it um like you
20:23 - see right just enable Opus for example
20:26 - and then you have access I will say I'm
20:29 - I'm going to be honest their Opus is
20:30 - like it's it's it's just GPT
20:34 - like I swear to God it gives me the same
20:36 - exact answers that GPT gives because I
20:38 - use actual CLA uhh and it's never that
20:42 - so their CLA sucks ass um and you need
20:47 - to work on that I actually yeah like
20:49 - when I am actually like when I need the
20:52 - highest quality of code uhhuh I will
20:54 - eventually go to Claud uhhuh if GPT just
20:56 - cannot get past it makes sense but the
20:59 - other thing as well on top of that I'm
21:01 - going to add on that to that is like I
21:05 - never used this I ever used this part
21:06 - right here the rules for
21:08 - AI all of us outp put your answers in
21:10 - Portuguese oh what the heck we just came
21:12 - from Brazil which is so
21:16 - funny but you can just specify hey
21:18 - always use functional react components
21:21 - don't use class components cuz there's
21:22 - so many times where I've had co- palet
21:26 - from vs code and be like hey create a
21:28 - clean component for me it would create a
21:31 - class component for me and I'm like I
21:33 - don't need that no yeah really yeah all
21:35 - the time and I'm like I don't
21:37 - need that yeah I've always wondered like
21:40 - what are good rules for me to sit here I
21:42 - haven't thought about it too much I
21:43 - haven't ran into like recurring enough
21:46 - problems yet at least that I felt like
21:48 - that I need to have you thought of any
21:49 - use cases for this yet the functional
21:51 - react stuff besides that for me it um I
21:55 - haven't ran into it doing a lot of
21:56 - class-based components myself yeah I
21:59 - don't know um no I haven't ran into too
22:02 - big too big of an issue this but it's
22:05 - good to know I wonder what people will
22:06 - say in the comments cuz I'm sure some
22:07 - people will have good use cases for
22:09 - where to use these rules and I would
22:10 - like to learn and the other thing I'm
22:12 - going to say as well is this what this
22:14 - what what I also noticed um copout of
22:17 - course as you guys start to type stuff
22:19 - right um of course it's going to start
22:22 - to recommend what kind of stuff to type
22:25 - and it uses the context of not just your
22:27 - current um page but also different M
22:29 - different pages so only the only your
22:32 - other opened pages I opened Pages you
22:34 - think so yeah that's what I I watch from
22:36 - YouTube videos for co-pilot oh for
22:38 - co-pilot you're talking about co-pilot
22:40 - right U I'm talking talking about this
22:42 - this oh cuz you said co-pilot oh okay my
22:44 - bad I could be wrong I I mix it up I mix
22:46 - it up okay okay I'm dumb go ahead but
22:49 - like yeah I've noticed that also the the
22:52 - way it also gives suggestions is so
22:55 - smart like if I do for example con uh
22:57 - loading for example here
22:59 - right um
23:02 - Bo loading set like it's just so smart
23:07 - the way it creates these suggestions I
23:10 - don't get those type of suggestions
23:12 - inside Coop palet um let's just say
23:14 - later on we actually want to do where we
23:16 - set I mean another cool one that I don't
23:18 - know if copilot does it is it will add
23:20 - multiple lines of Auto suggestion like
23:22 - it'll even edit existing things and
23:25 - autoc complete them because it starts to
23:27 - see what pattern you're
23:29 - exactly it just knows the pattern and
23:30 - it's so well right here for example it's
23:33 - recommending set loading to false which
23:34 - makes sense cuz we're on blur right or
23:37 - here for example it might said loading
23:38 - to true so again um this is just a very
23:42 - simple use case of this of course um and
23:44 - the use cases there are much much much
23:46 - bigger but there's all the time where I
23:48 - want to change some stuff for example
23:49 - let's just say here I want to go ahead
23:52 - and I just do like a
23:55 - div boom right
23:58 - like just like spinner like it just how
24:02 - did it know but spinner cuz I set the
24:04 - loading as a use St right it created a
24:06 - spinner uh div for me how cool is that
24:09 - you guys right yeah and so and then you
24:11 - might be like hey only show the spinner
24:13 - when there is a you know loading State
24:16 - you see suggestion right away when it's
24:18 - loading then you do loading spinner like
24:21 - so good I have not got that with Co
24:24 - palid it it there they have this like
24:27 - preview Auto complete view like you saw
24:29 - it was so cool and I'm always like
24:32 - that's so interesting how they do that I
24:33 - don't think any other editor does that
24:35 - one I absolutely love this and like like
24:37 - I was a big co- pilot user and I know
24:39 - what you guys are going to say like guys
24:40 - there's also extensions for V code that
24:42 - will do the same thing cuz it we got a
24:44 - lot of hate from that on Undead
24:46 - re as well which is like there's an
24:47 - extension that we do it yes that's right
24:49 - you can just use an extension there's
24:51 - many tools out there you can use this is
24:53 - just one of them this is the one that we
24:55 - just loved yeah and there's an
24:58 - amazing team behind it as well that we
25:01 - you know we haven't ever talked to them
25:02 - yet which would be amazing for a to chat
25:05 - with them hey guys hit us up H us oh
25:06 - that's actually cool I'd love
25:08 - the podcast with though it' be such a
25:10 - great podcast even if we did it in
25:11 - purpose person that'd be amazing too
25:13 - that would be really cool MH so yeah
25:15 - this is a product that we really enjoy
25:18 - you can check it out um and hey you guys
25:20 - are watching sponsor this content wink
25:23 - wink um but in the meantime we'll
25:26 - sponsor our own content
25:32 - um so if you interestingly enough want
25:35 - to take this video that you're actually
25:38 - watching yeah um and talk to it and take
25:41 - notes from it you know try to understand
25:43 - what's being covered so for example like
25:45 - if I'm ever watching a hormozi video you
25:47 - know I don't know if you know who he is
25:48 - or like if you're watching a developer
25:49 - video you can just talk to that video so
25:52 - I just brought this chat I'm just going
25:54 - to connect this YouTube video yeah and
25:56 - I'm just going to say hey
25:59 - what are three key insights from this
26:01 - video and it will start to give me those
26:05 - instantly MH um and I can you ever not
26:08 - erase it and I can say that what
26:12 - are uh uh give it to me with quotes also
26:17 - that way you can make sure that it's not
26:20 - hallucinating yeah perfect be like hey
26:22 - biil Will exist because this is how
26:24 - human beings learn and that sounds like
26:26 - something horoi would say
26:29 - um if you watch this video say something
26:32 - but what's cool as well is like what we
26:34 - made this tool for is you know for it's
26:36 - kind of like a visual collaborative
26:38 - version of GPT is kind of how we're
26:40 - thinking about it yeah um and the it
26:43 - gives the ability to not just understand
26:46 - and learn but to also create so if we if
26:49 - we can take this video and be like hey
26:51 - uh create for us a basic um you know a
26:54 - basic Twitter post let's just say out of
26:56 - this um you can do that as well
26:58 - and then you can you also record your
27:00 - own voice so let's just say you learned
27:02 - from this video yourself and then you
27:04 - record your own voice right I'll for
27:06 - example just say I just started hit I
27:09 - just hit recording by the way and you
27:11 - can see it moving and I'll be like hey
27:12 - the key lessons I learned from Heros
27:14 - videos that I want to actually start
27:16 - implementing is he says biases exist so
27:19 - in my business I want to be mindful of
27:21 - where I have biases and what type of
27:25 - employees I have biases towards because
27:27 - Step One is I want eliminate those so
27:29 - then I can hire better Talent yeah uh
27:32 - let's say personal Excellence I can go
27:34 - to step three and the action step I
27:35 - might want to take from this is I want
27:37 - to set really high standards for myself
27:39 - so then everybody else on my team
27:41 - automatically follows that without me
27:43 - having to tell them that I'll hit stop
27:46 - so now this is a voice recording mhm
27:49 - that we just finished MH and what is it
27:51 - doing right now NZ it is actually
27:54 - uploading the voice recording of course
27:55 - then is transcribing the voice recording
27:57 - and it's understanding it and it's even
27:59 - getting the title for it as well cool
28:01 - and uh can I talk to this voice
28:03 - recording yes you can so just connect it
28:05 - yep and you can connect by the way as
28:07 - many things as you would like pretty
28:08 - much um to here and at this point now
28:11 - you got these two knowledge bases that
28:14 - you can create you can use to create
28:15 - anything you want at this point so what
28:17 - are the action
28:19 - steps I want to take from my audio
28:23 - message so now it knows about my audio
28:26 - message yep and it's saying saying
28:28 - identify biases be mindful of biases in
28:31 - your business and work to eliminate them
28:32 - y two set high standards and three lead
28:35 - by example yep does that sound kind of
28:37 - about Prett much what just said i' be
28:40 - actually interested to see what would
28:41 - happen if you're like hey use the audio
28:44 - um use the audio message to create a
28:48 - Twitter post and
28:50 - reference um quotes from Alex heroi
28:56 - video just as a thought
28:59 - yeah um so that's actually really good
29:01 - so let's give it a try I like to say
29:02 - text message because it makes the
29:04 - writing really tight and it works really
29:06 - well for uh it'll work really well for
29:08 - Twitter too uh hey team inspired by
29:11 - Hero's videos and focusing oning
29:13 - remember biases will exist because that
29:15 - is how human beings learn let's set High
29:17 - personal lead by example personal
29:19 - example is the ultimate Rebellion let's
29:20 - strive to be better than any bias that's
29:23 - okay that that text text yeah that tweet
29:26 - tweet is okay tweet it's not the best uh
29:28 - take the values from
29:31 - Hermos video and turn them
29:35 - into uh Twitter
29:38 - posts uh with bullet points um and so
29:42 - let's give this a
29:44 - try yeah yeah again again because
29:48 - there's only three of them um we
29:50 - mentioned three or to you only use three
29:52 - key points you can actually ask it to
29:55 - use more key points uh from the video
29:59 - and feel free to
30:06 - elaborate nice awesome so now you're
30:09 - getting something longer now where it
30:11 - starts to shine is like if you if I mean
30:13 - if you're depends if you're using it for
30:15 - writing right if you're using it for key
30:16 - insights you got your key insights but
30:18 - if you're starting to use it for writing
30:20 - you still want to use a lot of your own
30:22 - voice because ai's voice is still like a
30:25 - little cringy mhm and I tend to avoid it
30:29 - being used as a voice cuz like you saw
30:31 - how like the AI is like oh hate team
30:33 - inspired by her's videos I'm focusing so
30:36 - bad so that's how 99% of these these AI
30:39 - writing tools are pretty much so like AI
30:41 - will yeah so like AI will do that and I
30:44 - like to avoid them by using my own voice
30:46 - so when I'm writing the tack that I like
30:49 - to use is I say hey specifically use my
30:51 - words and do not change them and I give
30:54 - it very strict parameters but let's say
30:56 - you're not using it for writing because
30:57 - like let's you're you're a developer
30:58 - you're using it for insights and to
31:00 - learn so if you're watching this exact
31:02 - video that you know you're watching
31:04 - right now and you take its URL you know
31:06 - you grab it and you pop it in here you
31:08 - can talk to you can be like hey what are
31:10 - the action St items these guys are
31:12 - blabbering on about for cursor IDE like
31:15 - why should I use it and it'll instantly
31:17 - tell you and then you can build on that
31:19 - knowledge base if you want to use it or
31:21 - not yeah and then you can of course you
31:23 - can like on the right side we have we
31:25 - created like a almost like a a writing
31:28 - uh platform it's like a notion like
31:30 - experi no experience so you can actually
31:32 - copy whatever you have in the in the
31:34 - right there paste it in boom done right
31:38 - so uh and that will always be there with
31:40 - you so you can expand on it so it's
31:41 - great if you're writing a book if you're
31:43 - writing an essay you name it and it's
31:46 - just a very very visual way of
31:48 - interacting with AI I feel if you're a
31:50 - developer you're likely taking notes so
31:52 - like you when you're watching all this
31:54 - content and you're extrapolating all
31:56 - this stuff you want to take notes
31:58 - just take him here and then if you want
32:01 - to get rid of it and not see it just
32:03 - close it out or open it again yep um
32:05 - anyways if you want to check this out
32:08 - we're working on this product right now
32:10 - so far we have 10 of you join this is
32:15 - super cool we launched
32:17 - this about a week or two weeks ago and
32:20 - now we're starting to share more and
32:21 - more you can go to get poppy. a/ launch
32:25 - actually one we could go yes exactly and
32:27 - if you go here it'll tell you about how
32:30 - it works and it'll tell you what are the
32:32 - things you can do so for example here's
32:34 - a use case of me talking to Andrew
32:36 - huberman's videos and talking about
32:38 - stress and
32:40 - adrenaline um if you want to go down
32:42 - rabbit holes and watch kurs Gart videos
32:44 - you can it understands images as
32:47 - well um here's me talking to Mr BEAST's
32:50 - podcast and pulling and saving myself
32:52 - eight hours yep and so and then I also
32:55 - have a bunch of deeper use cases here
32:59 - that I was just documenting or my team
33:00 - was documenting of their whole life so
33:02 - you know it's like I'm using it to write
33:04 - my life's philosophies and I have a loom
33:06 - video that just takes a boring Deep dive
33:09 - so you can technically understand how to
33:10 - use it better mhm uh here's an example
33:13 - of me planning a trip to Brazil and I
33:16 - literally have these decision like I'm a
33:17 - nerd right so I have like these
33:19 - decision-making processes of like for my
33:21 - system on how to book the trips for us
33:23 - mhm and I have all my information about
33:26 - the like all both of our information cuz
33:28 - we're going to Brazil where we're
33:30 - staying pictures from the Airbnb the
33:32 - Wi-Fi password everything yeah so then I
33:35 - can just talk to my GPT I don't have to
33:37 - worry about all this other information
33:39 - yep I can just talk to my GPT and be
33:41 - like how much is our Airbnb and it's
33:43 - like 1,700 bucks for two weeks I'm like
33:46 - what gate or where do I board you will
33:48 - board at Terminal 2 where am I flying
33:50 - what's my Wi-Fi password blah blah blah
33:52 - exactly and also it'll tell me
33:54 - everything um you know if you're doing
33:57 - it for project management you can use it
33:59 - for that like you can see that I pasted
34:02 - literally a image conversation with my
34:04 - friend mhm and it's picking that up so I
34:07 - don't know exactly what are all the use
34:09 - cases you guys would come up with or
34:11 - would think of yep uh but I'm sure that
34:14 - you guys would come up with some amazing
34:15 - stuff and then here's another
34:17 - interesting use case of me being sick
34:18 - and actually using it to create a
34:20 - fitness plan based off of like two
34:23 - Fitness influencers that are really
34:25 - trust and value MH and I basically put
34:29 - their videos and then talked to GPT to
34:31 - formulate a fitness plan that I could do
34:33 - while I was sick yeah so uh if you want
34:36 - to check it out go ahead to this page um
34:39 - we have link will be down below
34:40 - underneath underneath this
34:42 - video and cursor IDE helped us make this
34:46 - so yes let's go we circled it back fully
34:51 - around any closing statements that's it
34:54 - if you guys have any questions let us
34:55 - know down below but on that subscribe
34:57 - like comment we are currently on a very
35:00 - cool Indie called Indie hacker um what
35:03 - is it called Indie hackers uh mode of
35:06 - just building products and building
35:08 - amazing tools so yeah yeah follow us on
35:12 - all social medias and yeah yeah
