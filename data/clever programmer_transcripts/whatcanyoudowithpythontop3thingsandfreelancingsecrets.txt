00:00 - - Yo, people often ask me, and this guy,
00:03 - what can you do with Python?
00:05 - Just kidding, they don't ask this guy
00:07 - what you can do with
Python, they ask that guy
00:09 - what you can do with Python.
00:10 - - Dude, what can you do
with Python, dude tell me.
00:12 - - There is a lot you can do bro.
00:14 - So first of all let me actually show you,
00:16 - this is something actually
really, really cool.
00:18 - Behind every film.
00:21 - would you believe it?
00:22 - It's actually powered by Python.
00:25 - - [Tenzin] What?
00:26 - I didn't know that.
00:27 - - [Rafeh] Did you know that
Netflix was powered by Python?
00:30 - - Did not know that.
00:32 - - [Rafeh] A lot of people don't know that.
00:34 - And the point is that
software driven networking
00:38 - is actually a huge thing
that you can do in Python.
00:41 - - That's right.
00:42 - - That's pretty cool.
00:43 - All right, another really epic thing
00:45 - that you could do with Python,
00:47 - that most people don't know about,
00:49 - is actually data analysis,
00:52 - and this thing is way too
zoomed in, so let's zoom it out.
00:57 - The black hole image
00:59 - that was shot.
01:02 - - Is it possible to see something
01:03 - that by definition is impossible to see?
01:07 - Well it turns out that
if you were to zoom in
01:09 - at radio wavelengths, we
expect to see a ring of light
01:12 - caused by the gravitational
lensing of hot plasma
01:14 - zipping around the black--
01:15 - - [Rafeh] Jesus, did you know
that was made with Python,
01:18 - that was captured by Python?
01:20 - - I did not know that.
01:21 - - [Rafeh] I know bro.
01:23 - Me neither, until I googled
it, it's pretty crazy.
01:28 - Shit's wild out here.
01:29 - - Shit's wild.
01:30 - (Rafeh laughs)
01:32 - (relaxing beat plays)
01:40 - - [Tenzin] So we have--
- [Rafeh] Boom look at that.
01:41 - Python used to take
photo of the black hole.
01:45 - Damn, that's exciting stuff.
01:47 - And, just really quickly
plugging my Instagram here
01:51 - so you guys can follow me.
01:54 - Ey, ey, ey. (Rafeh laughs)
02:01 - - [Tenzin] I can't full screen that.
02:04 - - [Rafeh] What are you doing bro?
02:05 - - I'm just some ads you
know, just writing some ads.
02:11 - - [Rafeh] Oh, launching your course bro?
02:14 - - Come on man, come on.
02:16 - - [Rafeh] Come on, baby.
02:17 - If any developers wants to
learn, come learn from us.
02:20 - - That's right.
02:21 - - [Rafeh] I'm making millions baby girl.
02:23 - (both laugh)
02:27 - (while laughing) Come on man.
02:29 - Okay what else can you do with Python,
02:30 - like actually I'm asking you, like
02:32 - not even on the camera right now.
02:33 - - [Tenzin] Full stack
development, you know.
02:36 - - Full stack?
02:37 - - [Tenzin] Lots of job
opportunities, you know.
02:39 - One million,
02:40 - one million jobs are
supposed to be unfilled,
02:43 - you know, by 2022 so.
02:45 - - [Rafeh] Oh, this guy.
02:47 - - Python can be happening,
you what I'm saying?
02:49 - - All right, that's actually
02:50 - a great point, bro thank you.
02:51 - So, full stack development
you could do that with Python.
02:55 - Python is unbelievable for that so,
02:57 - for example this app that I'm on
03:00 - right now called Instagram,
03:04 - this is powered by Python.
03:09 - All right, this YouTube thing
03:12 - that we look at
03:15 - this is actually powered
by python as well.
03:19 - And I'll just make it
easier for all of us,
03:22 - by going to my website,
cleverprogrammer.com
03:26 - and
03:29 - here are all of the things, my friend,
03:32 - that are powered by Python.
03:34 - Google, YouTube,
Instagram, Reddit, Dropbox,
03:37 - Pinterest, Eventbrite and Spotify.
03:39 - Now,
03:41 - obviously these behemoth,
03:43 - giant software as a service
03:46 - companies, aren't just only using Python.
03:49 - They're using multiple other languages
03:52 - but I just wanted to give you a sense
03:54 - that Python is used for data analytics.
03:57 - It's used for full stack development
04:01 - and it's used for
software driven networking
04:06 - and you can be a beginner,
or you could be advanced
04:09 - you could be working at Google, or YouTube
04:12 - or you could be working at
NASA, or Netflix, using it.
04:16 - Another thing that I like to do
04:17 - when I'm looking up languages
and trying to figure out
04:19 - what can you do with them is,
04:22 - I like to, number one,
be very, very practical
04:25 - with this stuff so always look up
04:26 - what kind of job opportunities
exist and what kind of
04:29 - freelancing opportunities
exist for what you wanna do so,
04:32 - let me show you.
04:33 - So here's a good way
to like, figure it out.
04:35 - So like, I'm on UpWork right now.
04:37 - I'm gonna click here.
04:39 - It says jobs, I'm gonna type in Python.
04:42 - Now let's see what kind
of results come up.
04:46 - All right, so here are
some of the results.
04:49 - Says I'm looking for a programmer, cool.
04:54 - Python code, creating an
automated program, $500 job.
04:58 - Okay great.
04:59 - So they're basically
looking for what seems to be
05:02 - like, an SEO agency, and
they just want somebody
05:06 - to automate some scripts for them.
05:08 - Cool, what else?
05:10 - Somebody needs a Python web scraper.
05:15 - And, looks like somebody
needs a full stack developer
05:18 - that they're willing to pay $2500 for.
05:21 - Now this is the type of
stuff I always wanna look for
05:24 - when I'm looking for
a programming language
05:27 - or what kind of demand
there is for something,
05:29 - because I wanna know what kind
of freelancing opportunities
05:31 - there are, can I actually
start making an income from it
05:34 - and it's very important that
we actually stay practical
05:37 - and not just be so lost in
the high level of things.
05:42 - You know, here, even if you're a beginner
05:44 - you can just be like,
and just quadruple down
05:47 - on learning web scraping, and I can
05:49 - probably land a job at UpWork.
05:51 - Or maybe you could be like
hey if I just really went
05:53 - hard on the full stack development,
05:55 - maybe I could land a job right?
05:58 - Here somebody wants
you to actually work on
06:01 - what is it, looks pretty simple.
06:03 - Sport statistics website,
I mean that's pretty easy.
06:06 - The level is intermediate and they're
06:08 - gonna pay you 2500 bucks.
06:09 - So, really, the
possibilities with this shit
06:13 - are endless and it's really up to you
06:15 - how you put it to use, and you use it.
06:18 - So, that's kind of what I
wanted to share with you with
06:20 - what can you do with Python now,
06:24 - the question is, what do
you want to do with Python?
06:29 - So, drop that in the comments below,
06:31 - I would love to learn
what it is that you enjoy
06:34 - doing with Python and that's it from me.
06:36 - This is Qasi, I love your
face and I'll see you
06:39 - in the next video.
06:40 - From being completely broke
to then learning how to code
06:44 - in just a few months.
06:45 - Landing my contract as
a freelancer with Python
06:49 - and being able to make $20 000
06:52 - while I was a terrible
06:54 - community college student,
and to then being able
06:56 - to live the lifestyle I want
on my own terms and have
07:00 - the ability to have my
own time, freedom, money
07:03 - and have the ability to
make an impact on the world.
07:06 - And at the same time,
travel with my friends,
07:08 - be there for my family, you know
07:10 - when we hit 300 000 subscribers.
07:12 - Go to all these events.
07:13 - Even now, I'm in Miami at 10X Growth Con
07:16 - with Grant Cardone.
07:17 - How does that lifestyle come about?
07:19 - As a Python developer,
I was able to create
07:22 - that lifestyle for
myself and in this video
07:24 - I'm gonna show you that, how you
07:26 - can do that for yourself.
07:27 - Take students like for
example John Navarro,
07:30 - who went from working with
me, from complete zero
07:32 - to becoming a senior data scientist.
07:35 - Or Nazar Mally who landed
a $130 000 contract and now
07:39 - he's moved to Germany with his family
07:41 - and living an amazing life.
07:42 - Or Afrin Shaik who was
able to make $20 000
07:46 - after she took one of our programs.
07:48 - I've put together an
incredible training for you
07:51 - that'll help you become
a six figure developer.
07:54 - So you can earn the income that you want.
07:55 - You could have the time,
money and the freedom
07:57 - and the impact that you
wanna have in this world.
