00:00 - - Hey guys, what's up?
00:00 - This is Qasi from cleverprogrammer.com.
00:02 - Now in the last video, we talked about
00:05 - how can you make a script that
creates a square in one go?
00:12 - Right, so I gave you
an example of a script
00:16 - that does not make a square in one go.
00:18 - So I'm gonna start off in this video
00:21 - talking about how to do that,
00:23 - so I'm gonna solve that problem.
00:25 - If you haven't done it, go
still try to do that problem,
00:28 - but I'm gonna go over the
solution and then after that,
00:31 - we're gonna talk about what
the heck are variables?
00:33 - So let's keep going.
00:34 - So here if I run this code, right,
00:38 - notice what actually
happens, we get this thing,
00:41 - but we don't want it to
go to the right and down.
00:44 - We want it to keep going
'til it makes a square.
00:46 - So I'm simply going to copy this code
00:49 - and paste it again, except for this line.
00:55 - I wanna turn 90 degrees, and
then I wanna turn 90 degrees.
01:00 - And go straight one more time.
01:02 - So let's run this bad
boy, and check it out.
01:05 - Let's see what happens, okay.
01:09 - And boom, we have gotten a square.
01:12 - So if this was your code
and you copied this,
01:15 - and you went over to cleverprogrammer.com
01:18 - or you went to YouTube, my YouTube channel
01:24 - and pasted it below, that would be exactly
01:27 - what you would need to do, okay.
01:30 - So simple, go to Python for beginners
01:33 - and simply go Turtle In One Go,
01:37 - and you can paste the
code right here, okay?
01:40 - Back to what we were talking about.
01:46 - Whoops, the video actually started.
01:49 - So let's talk a little
bit about variables.
01:52 - Variables are very simple.
01:55 - It just allows you to store
information somewhere.
01:58 - Instead of having to
say, oh yeah, my friend
02:02 - with the white skin, or
he has this length hair
02:07 - and his nails are this
long, and he's this tall.
02:10 - Instead of saying all of that,
02:12 - we store all that information in his name.
02:15 - So we just say John or
Bob or whoever, right?
02:19 - That's exactly how variables are.
02:22 - Instead of saying all these things at once
02:24 - or having to remember them,
you just store it in a variable
02:27 - and then you just, you
know, recall that variable,
02:30 - and that's it, so something really simple.
02:33 - I could say Bob, right, is five years old.
02:40 - He is 68 inches tall
and wears brown suits.
02:49 - Now if I said Bob, you could see Bob
02:53 - or if I say x is equal to some big number,
02:57 - good luck trying to remember that number,
02:59 - but it's pretty easy to remember x, right?
03:02 - So you can say x, and
you can say x plus 10,
03:05 - or you can say x minus x,
and you should get back zero.
03:10 - Anyways, that's...
03:12 - Variables are very simple.
03:14 - On the left hand side, you
put what you want to store
03:17 - information into and
on the right hand side,
03:19 - you put what you want to store in there.
03:22 - Okay, that's it about variables.
03:25 - I'll see you guys in the next video
03:26 - where we talk about strings.
