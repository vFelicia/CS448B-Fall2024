01:52 - it doesn't get any better than that at
01:55 - all you're gonna be
01:56 - there with us with other people and that
01:59 - is really the type of environment that

02:02 - take your skill set with developing to
02:05 - the next
02:06 - level that's right so yeah we're going
02:08 - to be going pretty hard on this
02:10 - guys so
02:12 - um we're like i was talking with nas and
02:14 - i'm like dude we're going to lose our

02:18 - wake up
02:19 - and start doing training from 9 00 a.m
02:22 - or to 6 p.m i've always wanted to run
02:26 - boot camp style training sessions
02:29 - and now that we get a chance to do that
02:32 - is
02:33 - honestly dude looks super super exciting
02:35 - for me
02:36 - and it says this is as intense as it
02:38 - gets for
02:39 - us for you for everyone that is going to
02:41 - be involved with this process that's why
02:43 - they call it a boot camp right

02:49 - you just go hard
02:51 - as yeah you know whatever it is
02:53 - we're developing a skill
02:54 - physical training whatever that may be
02:56 - in this case we're going to teach you

05:39 - value while we're here so
05:41 - one thing i do want to say is we're
05:43 - going to be building an amazon clone
05:46 - in this workshop and we're going to be
05:48 - building out your
05:49 - we're going to be building it in a way
05:50 - where you can add it to your portfolio
05:52 - and we'll build your portfolio as well
05:54 - and we'll just give it to you
05:55 - straight up so so even for that the
05:58 - value of what you get out of this
06:00 - along with how much you learn is the
06:02 - portfolio
06:03 - with an amazing project for the
06:05 - portfolio which is probably enough
06:06 - to land you a job so let me ask you that
06:09 - 150
06:10 - you pay up front or 200 if you wait for
06:12 - after
06:13 - is that worth landing your first job as
06:16 - a freelancer your first contractor or
06:18 - your first job as a software developer
06:21 - yeah so i mean that's that's a huge prop
06:24 - right like if you
06:25 - get these skills and you build these
06:26 - projects on your portfolio i know a lot
06:28 - of students have landed jobs because of
06:29 - this
06:31 - um so a few fun things that i want to go
06:34 - over with you guys so
06:36 - so dude check this out okay i saw this
06:39 - earlier today
06:40 - and uh this guy i mean somebody's like
06:43 - don't really i don't even know why
06:44 - people do this
06:45 - like this guy built um there's something
06:47 - cool you guys can do too you just go to
06:49 - reddit and
06:50 - go like pop in react.js and sort by like
06:53 - top this month
06:54 - so this guy apparently built a website
06:59 - in into a desktop environment so like
07:03 - this is his website and this is what it
07:04 - looks like
07:08 - oh snaps so basically just fold oh
07:11 - damn bro i don't i don't understand the
07:14 - point of it is but
07:16 - you know what i mean like what the
07:17 - hell's the point of this but it's cool
07:21 - so you can do random stuff like this
07:23 - with react
07:27 - dude old school games bro this is like
07:31 - doing dumb okay
07:33 - [Music]
07:34 - this is pretty cool i thought so you
07:37 - know those like lingo apps you probably
07:38 - use some of those apps right yeah
07:40 - duolingo or
07:41 - do you use duolingo i used to i have for
07:46 - i was trying to learn german man oh
07:49 - yeah and then that was tough and i
07:50 - was like oh
07:51 - i couldn't be consistent with it to be
07:52 - honest you got out of the dirt
07:55 - i got i went back to the clouds imagined
07:57 - learning it
07:58 - so yeah like look at this did this guy
08:00 - build would react i mean isn't that cool
08:02 - like this bubble
08:03 - how this just dude just something that
08:06 - always fascinated me
08:08 - when i was growing up personally yeah me
08:10 - personally when i was growing
08:12 - up yeah was just the animations and also
08:15 - when they came to like video games
08:16 - right like whenever you're going through
08:19 - some levels or whatever that was
08:20 - how did you interact with people and if
08:22 - they're part of whatever journey your
08:24 - character was going through
08:26 - like how did they know the script and
08:27 - how all that was just programmed and
08:29 - then when you got to like
08:30 - grand theft auto how the random people
08:31 - just did random stuff you know like
08:33 - that's all
08:34 - code you know yeah so when i see any
08:36 - kind of animation 3d 2d
08:38 - whatever it is i'm always impressed
08:39 - because i never really dug deep into
08:41 - that right but i did more of the coding
08:43 - of
08:44 - you know like the press this button do
08:45 - that not like actual animations moving
08:48 - in this direction because all that is is
08:50 - manipulation of pixels
08:51 - yeah and when you dig into it it gets
08:54 - pretty intense and it gets pretty crazy
08:55 - like there's
08:56 - it's a bunch of like um in college you
08:59 - don't have to take like a
09:00 - linear linear algebra like 3d matrixes
09:02 - that's what that really is when it comes
09:04 - to animations
09:05 - geez but just so many people have built
09:07 - on top of that yeah that they've made it
09:08 - easy yeah it's abs abstracted like even
09:10 - um
09:11 - alex becker recently is like building on
09:13 - coding games now
09:14 - it's kind of crazy yeah yeah like all
09:16 - his youtube content right now is like
09:17 - him building coding games it's insane
09:19 - that's
09:19 - crazy um somebody said the creative said
09:22 - cause you have registered but i can't
09:23 - seem to find the link to join your slack
09:24 - community also no link in my email
09:27 - um so don't worry we will fix that uh
09:30 - the creative if you've joined just make
09:32 - sure you shoot a text message to the
09:34 - community app
09:36 - and we will take care of you there okay
09:37 - um just let me know what your name is
09:39 - in community just shoot me a text once
09:42 - you shoot me a text i will personally
09:44 - send you the slack link
09:45 - so it works
09:50 - yeah i know i know um i built the
09:53 - amazon clone and got hella interviews yo
09:55 - that's what i'm talking about bro
09:58 - like if you build those clones you're
10:01 - gonna get so many opportunities is kind
10:03 - of insane
10:04 - if you uh tons and tons of students that
10:07 - came and built out those projects that
10:09 - we showed
10:10 - still to this day message me and they're
10:12 - like hey we got a job offer we got a job
10:14 - offer for this so
10:15 - definitely keep building those and keep
10:17 - putting them on your portfolio
10:19 - and this is why we're doing this
10:20 - workshop too so you can build it and put
10:22 - it put on your portfolio yeah and by the
10:23 - way out of curiosity man if you could
10:25 - let us know
10:25 - where you're able to get interviews
10:27 - whether that was just like freelancing
10:28 - projects that you got from upwork or
10:30 - whatever that is
10:31 - we'd be really interested man just
10:32 - because it's awesome hearing
10:34 - what projects like these are able to
10:36 - help people achieve sometimes
10:38 - wow aman says yokazi i've made my own
10:41 - application by putting together all the
10:43 - things i
10:44 - learned from your clones gonna host it
10:46 - today and test it with my dev team
10:48 - i hope it works well gonna send you the
10:50 - hosted link
10:52 - we are looking forward to seeing that
10:58 - link
11:00 - yo that is absolutely amazing bro proud
11:03 - of you
11:04 - that's awesome good work for sure man
11:07 - um so okay so let's check some out some
11:09 - of this stuff out
11:12 - sweat bubbles i mean if it sucks or we
11:15 - don't like it we can just move past it
11:16 - you know we don't have to
11:17 - talk about it we have to make sure we
11:20 - like it
11:20 - yeah this is cool right yeah for sure
11:23 - and i mean something this reminds me of
11:25 - was
11:26 - when i was in university yeah and i was
11:27 - developing ios applications
11:30 - very often you wanted to find these cool
11:32 - interactive things like for example
11:33 - something that i remember that was big
11:35 - was freaking nice in spotify i don't
11:38 - know if you remember
11:39 - but it was like a gallery view where you
11:41 - had the thing you swiped right and you
11:43 - saw like the
11:44 - the whole thing and what you like in
11:46 - what app
11:47 - uh spotify okay you see the album
11:49 - picture swipe right and then you see
11:51 - like this carousel carousel yeah
11:53 - just rotating that's what they called it
11:55 - and it was just some random dude
11:57 - who developed this third-party library
11:59 - like i ended up
12:00 - getting his library from get github to
12:02 - like use it in my app oh wow
12:04 - but then later i don't know like if um
12:07 - the swift or whatever the apple team
12:09 - ended up doing that same library or just
12:10 - made their own
12:11 - yeah but that became like a standard
12:13 - feature like they brought it into the ui
12:15 - kit
12:15 - and i was like dude like this guy
12:16 - created his own thing again doing the
12:18 - animation stuff
12:19 - and then it became my thing yeah dude
12:22 - they just blew up dude like everyone's
12:24 - like oh my god the carousel thing that's
12:25 - freaking sick man
12:26 - are you using that that's sick so i
12:28 - didn't know you were doing front-end
12:29 - stuff too
12:30 - at some point or playing i i played a
12:33 - lot front end when i was doing mobile
12:34 - development so i did a lot for
12:36 - ios and android stuff got it yeah that
12:39 - was that was fun
12:41 - that's pretty dope
12:44 - uh this one i thought was kind of funny
12:46 - this guy says i made a ridiculous react
12:48 - app to create
12:49 - corporate culture and indoctrinate your
12:51 - employees
12:52 - and he basically says your employees
12:54 - aren't gonna brainwash themselves
12:57 - and um basically you just put in like a
12:59 - random word right so like you put in
13:01 - success
13:02 - and then it says get cultured and then
13:05 - like
13:05 - it creates like a thing out of success
13:08 - standing is a wreck sitting you saw that
13:12 - yeah yeah it creates it's uh
13:16 - [Music]
13:18 - culture yeah what are those things
13:20 - called like the principles that
13:22 - it just says random at the top
13:24 - bottom i love that
13:26 - what principles of what um like a
13:29 - business like you know how amazon has
13:30 - their like
13:31 - for example blue origin had their 12
13:33 - leadership principles
13:34 - right yeah which was like damn i'm
13:36 - really forgetting them bro
13:38 - um delivering excellence
13:42 - um damn bro i'm liking that but
13:45 - like for amazon it was like prioritizing
13:48 - customers
13:49 - yeah being frugal yeah and specifically
13:51 - yeah yeah i know those values yeah
13:53 - the values that's what yeah i know yeah
13:56 - whatever that was
13:57 - oh only setups dude so guys check this
14:01 - out this is like only fans but for
14:03 - pictures of desk setup so don't tell
14:04 - anybody that you're on here
14:06 - it's definitely an sfw but check it out
14:08 - dude
14:09 - i'm pretty sure people would pay for
14:10 - this bro yeah imagine like i have a five
14:13 - dollar a month subscription and it's
14:15 - like under
14:16 - uh under like an anonymous name oh that
14:19 - one's cool dude
14:20 - just like corporate llc it's like hey
14:23 - what is this for
14:24 - don't worry about it babe this one
14:27 - actually seems pretty cool like uh this
14:29 - actually i'm i wanted to look into it
14:32 - because sometimes when you're doing
14:33 - transformations and a lot of things with
14:36 - react you want to see
14:37 - visually what is happening so like for
14:38 - example when you're doing stuff like
14:39 - this right
14:40 - you're taking an input and you're
14:42 - mapping and filtering and reducing it
14:43 - whatever
14:44 - the you get to actually see a
14:45 - visual playground
14:47 - that is sick man see what i'm saying
14:49 - yeah so like those functions you can
14:51 - actually see what they're doing and
14:52 - you're like
14:53 - oh map is mapping it
14:56 - and filter is i mean you know filter
15:00 - so like i mean what i'm imagining it's
15:02 - doing here is like getting the even
15:03 - numbers right yeah
15:04 - mapping is probably just like here just
15:07 - taking the number and adding one to it
15:09 - and then this is filtering it and reduce
15:13 - is always a complicated one
15:15 - but if you learn how to write reduced
15:17 - you can write these
15:18 - really sophisticated one-liners which
15:20 - allow you to have those
15:22 - you know those like for loops we're
15:23 - doing incremental
15:25 - value and then like so it's like it just
15:27 - lets you write that in one line it's
15:29 - super simple i know exactly what i mean
15:32 - dan bro this is just throwing back to a
15:33 - bunch of projects this reminds me of a
15:35 - cool project that i worked on with a
15:36 - couple friends
15:37 - we had to create a context flow diagram
15:41 - or cfg i forgot what that means exactly
15:44 - yeah but what that looks like is
15:46 - thursday there's traps for the devs oh
15:53 - this is already said we keep going
15:54 - unless then
15:56 - yeah and if you look at any piece of
15:58 - code yeah
16:00 - it always has a specific flow yeah so
16:03 - what i mean by that is
16:04 - you know the first block is just setting
16:06 - up all your variables or whatever that
16:07 - is
16:08 - it has to go through all of those lines
16:11 - but then let's say it hits line 10 that
16:12 - hits an if statement
16:13 - yeah sometimes it's going to go into the
16:15 - if other times it's going to go into the
16:17 - else
16:18 - yeah so what this does is this creates a
16:20 - graph
16:21 - where you say like all right lines one
16:23 - through nine
16:24 - or have to get hit but the minute hits
16:26 - line 10 it could go to
16:28 - 10 through 13 which could be like the if
16:30 - statement or it could go through 14
16:32 - through 16
16:33 - which is the else statement so it starts
16:35 - to create this graph
16:36 - right the code it shows you these are
16:38 - all the different paths you can take for
16:39 - example if you have a for loop
16:40 - there's going to be some place where you
16:42 - could go back to a certain specific line
16:44 - right or if it's like uh if else what's
16:47 - the point of this
16:48 - so this basically maps out your code
16:51 - like all the different possible paths
16:53 - that your code can take
16:55 - okay so what application yeah that's
16:57 - what i was going to ask like what's the
16:58 - actual application of your use case of
17:00 - this are you trying to like reduce the
17:01 - complexity by reducing the number of
17:03 - pads or like if you see a certain number
17:04 - of pads you're like whoa this is way too
17:05 - complex we need to
17:07 - so you could create a visual similar
17:08 - similar to this where you see the graph
17:10 - but i think more importantly a good
17:12 - thing for this could be when you're
17:14 - testing
17:14 - right yeah when you're testing your
17:16 - software you want to make sure you get
17:18 - all the branches oh my gosh all those if
17:20 - statements right yeah
17:21 - so if you run a test that covers the
17:23 - entire graph you know that you have a
17:25 - hundred percent coverage
17:26 - uh if it doesn't cover the entire graph
17:28 - you could really start this so you can
17:29 - kind of visually see what yours
17:31 - exactly got it exactly sick but it's
17:33 - cool because you just give it
17:34 - what we have to do is he we gave it like
17:36 - a code that was just thousands of lines
17:38 - if you guys have any questions by the
17:39 - way keep dropping them in chat we'll
17:41 - definitely take your questions and we'll
17:43 - try to answer them while we're on here
17:44 - as well
17:45 - for sure and it was just crazy man like
17:47 - you just threw a thousand line
17:49 - like project of code and had to map out
17:51 - this big ass thing with just all these
17:53 - circles and all these graphs of what it
17:55 - would look like
17:56 - damn exactly says sounds like a
17:58 - debugging tool
17:59 - yeah yeah it could definitely be
18:00 - leveraged for that or for fun you know
18:02 - if you're
18:03 - weird you just want the challenge you're
18:05 - like let's do it
18:06 - yeah um awesome
18:10 - so let's go here boom
18:13 - my okay my first big react project
18:15 - that's a pretty cool project by the way
18:17 - to work on if you guys have a project
18:19 - like this on your portfolio
18:21 - this is definitely something that can
18:22 - land you a job so what i recommend
18:25 - is if you're finding hot trends on
18:27 - reddit
18:29 - it's a good sign because people it shows
18:32 - you that people are caring about this
18:33 - and this
18:34 - looks good and has a lot of user
18:35 - functionality
18:37 - you can actually use this to build out a
18:39 - project hey thank you so much for the
18:40 - twenty 20
18:42 - donation whoa yo
18:45 - that's sick hey
18:49 - oh thank you so much really really
18:52 - really appreciate you josh paul
18:54 - he says thanks for the videos i'm a
18:55 - professional developer feeling motivated
18:57 - to share my knowledge online
18:59 - after watching your videos to start a
19:00 - youtube channel
19:02 - hopefully i will stop procrastinating
19:04 - and start acting keep motivating
19:07 - let me correct that right now hopefully
19:11 - or will you actually do it
19:15 - um i'll tell you this today i felt like
19:17 - absolute
19:18 -  okay that's what i'll tell you
19:20 - today was a
19:21 - extremely tough day my brain was running
19:24 - at all
19:24 - 97 processing power capacity
19:29 - by 12 p.m or 1 p.m i was working from 7
19:31 - 00 am to like 1 p.m just exhausted
19:34 - nauseous hungry didn't eat there were a
19:36 - lot of tough problems that we had to
19:38 - tackle
19:39 - and i just didn't feel good then i took
19:41 - a little walk went on a break hung out
19:42 - with nas and then came back three or
19:44 - four p.m
19:46 - and uh i sat down to talk with daniel
19:50 - uh right here and uh nas
19:53 - and i didn't want to do anything bro all
19:56 - i wanted to do was just
19:58 - go to sleep or relax
20:01 - take a break i promise you the last
20:04 - thing i wanted to do was
20:06 - work my ass off for the rest of the day
20:08 - and
20:09 - jump on this youtube live stream and do
20:11 - a live stream
20:12 - um this was the opposite of what i had
20:15 - wanted to do
20:16 - but now that we're actually doing it
20:20 - this feels
20:20 - so much better than the alternative of
20:22 - just not doing anything
20:24 - and i know that once today is over i'm
20:26 - gonna be even
20:27 - more proud of the fact that like i did
20:29 - this and that we did this
20:31 - so what i'll say is look you donated to
20:34 - me
20:34 - and you donated to this channel i
20:36 - appreciate that but what i will
20:38 - appreciate a lot more
20:39 - is you actually taking action okay so no
20:42 - hopefully brother
20:43 - i want you to do it and i want you to
20:45 - make a commitment while you're here on
20:47 - this youtube
20:48 - what you're gonna do if you can do
20:49 - something today take a
20:51 - 15 minutes out today and shoot a video
20:54 - with your phone horizontally
20:56 - like sideways right
20:59 - like you have 10 or 15 minutes
21:03 - so what can you do today that anchors
21:06 - that commitment
21:07 - and that would be the best way you can
21:09 - thank me i'll tell you that right now
21:11 - and what's crazy is maybe hearing quasi
21:13 - see that right now you're going to feel
21:14 - that spark motivation
21:16 - and there's something in the head in
21:17 - your head that's gonna tell you oh like
21:19 - tomorrow or another day
21:20 - but just trust me dude that motivation
21:22 - is gonna be gone tomorrow that
21:24 - motivation is gonna be gone
21:25 - in the week in two weeks whenever you
21:27 - think it's gonna happen so
21:28 - right now man just pull out your phone
21:31 - start filming
21:32 - whatever it is it doesn't have to be
21:34 - perfect it just has to get done
21:36 - that's right bro just get it done all
21:39 - right
21:40 - so that is that
21:43 - now another thing that i found super um
21:46 - another thing i found amazing is this
21:48 - okay so
21:50 - this guy goes i seriously love react
21:54 - plus jam stack approach
21:56 - went from knowing zero programming to
21:58 - launching my own
21:59 - web business in less than a year just
22:02 - got my first 100 paying customers
22:05 - and really proud and happy that i did
22:06 - this i just wanted to share
22:08 - i spent 10 years in a career of branding
22:11 - slash advertising and went from knowing
22:13 - no programming to launching my first
22:15 - product in a year
22:16 - i know a lot of folks here probably
22:18 - experienced this but for me this was
22:20 - quite a huge undertaking so i went
22:22 - to it and here is a stack that he used
22:25 - okay
22:26 - so i'll show you the app first so here's
22:29 - the app
22:30 - focus and structure to get work done a
22:32 - task manager like no other
22:34 - this is i like this part over here so
22:36 - it's you see how it says give me focus
22:38 - yeah and when i hover over it that's
22:40 - good
22:41 - right that is good um and basically it's
22:43 - like a task list but just
22:45 - you know looks better and has some uh
22:48 - some fun functionality to it
22:50 - can't spell functionality a tough one uh
22:53 - here's a stack that he used so this is i
22:55 - think something valuable
22:56 - for you guys where you can check out his
22:58 - website and then also
22:59 - see the stack that he used so he's using
23:02 - javascript and react for the ui
23:07 - he's using custom css with a little bit
23:09 - of bootstrap i mean i recommend you can
23:12 - use material ui for most of what you're
23:14 - doing
23:15 - he's using animate css for his animation
23:18 - so let's see if he has where are his
23:20 - animation so let's go to his page
23:24 - so i'm not sure what he's using it for
23:27 - animate that css
23:29 - maybe maybe these gifs are animated it
23:31 - could also just be the animation of when
23:33 - you hover over the button
23:34 - that's true okay i don't know how deep
23:36 - his animations are
23:38 - so dude like this is so sick man like
23:41 - he did this probably he's like oh man
23:44 - like i'd probably use this
23:46 - you know yeah he's like i'm gonna
23:47 - develop this and then
23:49 - i'm just gonna put it out there and like
23:50 - you got customers that's crazy yeah dude
23:52 - like even that bro like if you got 100
23:54 - customers at four dollars
23:56 - 400 a month you know it's just like that
23:58 - extra it's like dude you're able to
24:00 - create
24:01 - an amazing product from nothing from
24:03 - just an idea
24:04 - and hard work and blood and sweat and
24:06 - tears sometimes that's kind of insane
24:08 - dude
24:09 - that was one of the things that took me
24:10 - to programming it was just the
24:12 - you're limited by your imagination at
24:15 - some point
24:16 - you know it's like how far do you want
24:18 - to take something what do you want to
24:19 - build how do you want to do that
24:20 - yo we just got a bunch of new students
24:23 - in the program so we got
24:24 - bmu we got jubble we got tesla developer
24:28 - we got
24:28 - zaki talib um andy
24:32 - we got uh wise mickey thai santos
24:35 - sky dialia and rdev i just want to say
24:39 - thank you guys
24:41 - oops i just want to say thank you guys
24:43 - so much for
24:44 - joining the program
24:47 - and joining the live workshop that we've
24:50 - put together
24:50 - if you guys are joining the workshop
24:52 - just drop a comment
24:54 - and then just say like something like
24:56 - react is
24:57 - lit all right react if you have already
25:01 - joined the workshop
25:02 - and jumped in then say react is lit so
25:05 - we can actually see
25:07 - that you're in i'm gonna give you a
25:10 - shout out
25:12 - dude can we oh brian kim what's up
25:16 - brother he's in uh
25:17 - youtube masters academy right let's go
25:19 - brian
25:22 - we're out here grinding
25:26 - over here brian what you see is the
25:28 - youtube analytics
25:29 - all right this is what you're looking at
25:31 - right over here where my finger is
25:33 - pointing
25:34 - when that drops that mean on this live
25:36 - stream
25:37 - people are losing attention and not
25:40 - not watching the stream anymore when it
25:43 - goes
25:44 - up is a great sign so for example i'm
25:46 - going to move this screen so you can see
25:48 - that
25:49 - we had a little dip and then we made it
25:50 - go up all right
25:52 - i watched this constantly to see what
25:54 - type of retention we have
25:55 - if we're losing the people boom we're
25:57 - gonna get it lit
25:59 - so zaki says react is lit that means
26:01 - jackie joined vishnu says
26:04 - um another one another thing i want you
26:07 - guys to say so just as
26:08 - clear for everybody else is just be like
26:09 - yo um i joined the workshop okay i
26:12 - joined the react workshop
26:13 - because that helps everybody else know
26:15 - what you did but thank you so much
26:17 - vishnu for joining startup for joining
26:19 - tech comparison for joining rohit for
26:21 - joining irish for joining
26:23 - it's crazy right ashley alex thank you
26:26 - for joining suresh i appreciate you for
26:28 - joining
26:28 - smith i appreciate you for joining
26:31 - tomorrow the enrollment for this
26:33 - three-day workshop that we're doing
26:35 - closes all right tomorrow midnight it
26:37 - closes and then that's it
26:39 - i don't know when we're gonna do this
26:40 - again it's 24 hours of training it's
26:42 - absolutely stupid for me and us to do
26:44 - this
26:45 - but we just thought it would be so much
26:47 - fun so we decided to just
26:48 - make it so it's like pretty much free
26:51 - the cost
26:52 - of it is next to nothing i mean really
26:54 - people charge four to five thousand
26:55 - dollars for these workshops
26:57 - so we wanted to make it so price is no
27:00 - barrier
27:01 - but it allows us to see you're serious
27:03 - you're willing to put your money where
27:04 - your mouth is and then boom we can just
27:06 - get the money out of the way
27:07 - so we can focus on what's important
27:09 - actually helping you build your career
27:11 - all right and we want to make sure the
27:12 - community is high quality muhammad says
27:14 - i joined

30:04 - who we looking for again oh i lost it
30:07 - it's all good
30:08 - lost what i was looking for was it ben
30:11 - benjamin
30:12 - i forgot who are you trying to get but
30:14 - yeah guys this workshop
30:16 - we've never done this before in the
30:19 - history of clever programmer
30:20 - nas and qazi we're just brainstorming we
30:24 - had already thought about it before but
30:25 - they were able to just kind of solidify
30:26 - this
30:27 - and put this together and it's going to
30:29 - be absolutely
30:30 - insane i really can't even talk about
30:33 - like
30:33 - the value that they're going to get a
30:35 - weekend workshop like this
30:37 - it's going to be fun man i'm so excited
30:39 - fun it's going to be insane
30:40 - it's just going to be robert miller says
30:42 - just found out about your channel a few
30:43 - weeks ago confused if i should go to
30:45 - college or do something else
30:46 - leaving the army in a few weeks robert i
30:50 - would love to get on a call with you
30:51 - if you want to chat i popped in my phone
30:54 - number
30:55 - up top so let me see if i can find it
30:58 - again
30:59 - uh shoot me a message here robert and
31:01 - let's get on a call or
31:03 - if you're not scared just drop your
31:04 - number in here robert and i'll call you
31:06 - right now
31:09 - bluetooth
31:13 - yeah let's see here
31:22 - oh snaps trying to reach out to people
31:27 - yeah so i would love to get on a call
31:29 - with you
31:30 - but what i will say is this workshop
31:34 - it i i think would be your best bet for
31:37 - jumping into and learning how to code
31:40 - you're gonna
31:40 - leave with skill like you're gonna learn
31:44 - the beginner stuff you're gonna
31:45 - build an actual project you can use you
31:48 - will be
31:49 - fully immersed in it for three days
31:51 - straight and
31:52 - you will have your answer if coding is
31:54 - for you or not you're gonna be kind of
31:56 - blown away by it
31:57 - so this is we're gonna be going all in
31:59 - it's going to be the best workshop on
32:01 - react that anybody's ever hosted
32:03 - because we don't hold back so it's going
32:06 - to be a ton of fun
32:07 - and i think something huge that qazi
32:09 - said there is in this weekend
32:11 - you're going to see if programming is
32:13 - cut out for you or if you're cut out for
32:14 - programming
32:15 - because to be honest it just might not
32:18 - be for you if you haven't
32:19 - you know gotten really deep into it so
32:22 - it probably wouldn't be worth
32:23 - getting a whole degree if it's not for
32:26 - you so you dive in
32:27 - this weekend go hard learn as much as
32:29 - possible we're going to tailor it
32:30 - for people who have never programmed
32:32 - before to go and get
32:34 - all literally as technically deep as you
32:37 - need to to learn these things
32:38 - you're going to know exactly what the
32:40 - next steps are going to be for you after
32:41 - that
32:42 - yep that's right i just tuned in
32:46 - preston haley says just this workshop is
32:47 - meant for true beginner programmers
32:49 - absolutely yes what exactly is new in
32:53 - this from last five-day amazon challenge
32:56 - so rxbo a few things that are new
32:59 - one is it's going to be on a zoom
33:02 - call so we're going to be building this
33:04 - live together
33:06 - and you're going to be working with
33:07 - other people
33:09 - in those facebook lives you can interact
33:12 - with me
33:13 - nas and the whole community you'll be
33:14 - able to interact with everybody
33:16 - two on day three we're going to be
33:20 - announcing the opening of our clever
33:23 - programmer coding boot camp
33:25 - this will be a 12 month coding boot camp
33:28 - with four immersive retreats this is
33:31 - going to be the first place we're gonna
33:33 - be announcing it
33:34 - and so you'll be the first one to find
33:36 - out about that as well on day three
33:40 - we're excited for that dude i'm excited
33:42 - as well bro
33:43 - uh workshop link guys is i just popped
33:46 - up the screen you can read it at the top
33:48 - all right top right there and also it's
33:52 - in the description below in
33:53 - uh linked in this youtube video
34:00 - here are some other projects now one
34:02 - thing i want to go into is would you
34:03 - guys
34:04 - like to learn how you can ace your
34:06 - interviews as a react.js developer or
34:09 - just a web developer in general
34:11 - hell yeah you guys want to know hell
34:12 - yeah all right
34:14 - so this is something really valuable
34:16 - that i found that i wanted to share with
34:18 - you guys
34:20 - um advice on how to ace your react.js
34:23 - interview all right and this is with
34:29 - from a hiring manager so i'm a front-end
34:32 - manager at a large bank here in new york
34:35 - city
34:36 - and i thought i'd share some advice on
34:38 - how to ace front end react interviews
34:40 - i am putting in react i'm putting
34:42 - react.js in quotes because we
34:44 - all know the most competitive jobs
34:47 - don't just look at your react.js skills
34:51 - for some reason i'm not allowed to tell
34:53 - hr to give you a study list
34:56 - i personally don't care that you
34:57 - specifically study the areas that i list
34:59 - out because if you can come from nothing
35:01 - and study these topics to the point of
35:02 - passing the interview then
35:04 - yeah you're probably darn well good
35:06 - enough to work here without further ado
35:08 - let's go one never just react js
35:13 - love it or hate it knowing react itself
35:16 - is never
35:17 - enough so what he says is sharpen your
35:20 - vanilla javascript skills so this is
35:22 - something that i actually agree
35:24 - quite a bit on where he says everyone is
35:27 - looking for framework
35:28 - agnostic candidates that can actually be
35:30 - successful in
35:31 - multiple paradigms and can code across
35:34 - different frameworks do you find this to
35:38 - be
35:38 - true like as a as a good skill for
35:41 - developers to be
35:42 - framework agnostic and why is that i
35:46 - totally agree with that 100 and the
35:48 - reason is because
35:49 - great developers just understand
35:52 - the just they're really good developers
35:54 - and what i mean by that is
35:56 - they understand that a computer is just
35:58 - a machine that reads line by line by
36:00 - line
36:00 - like unless you're doing async or
36:02 - multi-threading uh programming
36:04 - but for front end that's mostly what it
36:05 - is unless you throw in some async
36:07 - but you can then now manipulate the
36:10 - computer to do whatever you want it to
36:12 - do
36:12 - doesn't matter whether it's you know
36:14 - react angular because the thing is those
36:16 - things
36:17 - are gonna get outdated at some point in
36:18 - life yeah you know five years ten years
36:20 - i don't know how long
36:21 - long it's gonna be but there's gonna be
36:22 - the new ui framework who knows it might
36:25 - be like some vr
36:26 - slash ui web i don't know what that's
36:28 - going to look like
36:29 - but it's going to be replaced so if
36:31 - you're just a great programmer in
36:33 - general
36:33 - you understand programming principles
36:35 - programming fundamentals and how things
36:38 - work
36:38 - then you could easily adapt and that is
36:42 - what is a huge
36:43 - key here that's it so
36:47 - that's i agree with that bro like i
36:49 - actually think that
36:51 - it's really important for people who are
36:53 - good at being a developer i think they
36:55 - should just
36:55 - be good at problem solving in general
36:58 - i've found myself constantly picking up
37:01 - any new language or any new framework
37:04 - and i get
37:04 - really good at it really fast because i
37:06 - just have really solid problem solving
37:08 - skills and i feel that i can go over to
37:11 - anything and kind of get good at it you
37:13 - know so
37:14 - i agree that that's probably not the
37:17 - most important thing
37:18 - for sure and i think in terms of the
37:20 - problem solving skills for some people
37:21 - sometimes
37:22 - when it comes to programming that's just
37:24 - not natural it feels like
37:26 - they really have to work at that but the
37:28 - thing is it's a skill
37:29 - it's something you can work on it's
37:31 - something you could develop you just
37:32 - have to put in the time you have to put
37:34 - into practice
37:35 - you have to keep challenging yourself
37:36 - and as you develop these problem-solving
37:38 - skills
37:39 - things are going to come a lot quicker
37:40 - things are going to come a lot easier
37:41 - you're going to have a lot of reference
37:42 - experience from your back
37:44 - or from your past yeah so that you could
37:46 - just do it again
37:47 - just without even skills
37:51 - yeah so what was super cool i just saw
37:54 - right now we got
37:55 - five more students that actually just
37:58 - joined
38:00 - that is so sick i'm so excited this
38:02 - workshop is going to be
38:04 - amazing guys i by the way there are no
38:07 - replays i just want to say there are no
38:08 - replays for this workshop
38:10 - so it's three days if you get to join

38:28 - there
38:28 - live you're going to get that
38:30 - interaction right if you just try to
38:31 - watch the replays
38:32 - it's just going to be like watching a
38:34 - tutorial building a cool clone i mean
38:36 - you get to build it
38:37 - but you miss out on being able to
38:39 - network with people you miss out on
38:40 - being there and being
38:41 - able to ask your specific questions so
38:44 - top up dev
38:45 - asks is it free it's not free it's a
38:48 - paid
38:49 - workshop it does have a free trial
38:53 - just to protect you if you
38:56 - do that free trial and you sign up by
38:58 - paying zero dollars up front
39:01 - seven days later if you took the
39:03 - workshop and you
39:04 - didn't like it in between those seven
39:07 - days
39:07 - you can cancel any time and not get
39:09 - charged anything at all
39:10 - okay we'll just give you an email you
39:12 - send an email there that's it done
39:15 - if you loved it and you're like this was
39:17 - freaking awesome and it changed my life
39:18 - and i have a portfolio and a project i
39:21 - then just do nothing and it'll
39:22 - automatically charge you okay so we have
39:24 - a free
39:25 - trial but it is a paid workshop
39:29 - and top of dev you know like how i
39:31 - already said earlier in the slide i
39:32 - don't know if you missed it but
39:34 - for the payment of either 150 or 400 200
39:37 - if you're able to get a portfolio from
39:39 - that if you're able to get an amazing
39:40 - clone from that if you're able to learn
39:42 - all the skills and you get a job from
39:43 - this
39:44 - yeah is it worth 200 to you
39:47 - the answer is obviously hell yeah bro
39:49 - like without a doubt
39:51 - yeah so enjoy it yup free trial
39:54 - um ishaan says i'm going to just join
39:58 - your course to watch you
40:00 - nice welcome we would love to have you
40:03 - and once you're in then definitely
40:05 - come and comment below i just joined the
40:08 - react.js workshop make sure you comment
40:10 - that below
40:12 - right here
40:15 - all right
40:21 - and if you join from here i would be
40:24 - happy to do a
40:25 - one-on-one call dude
40:28 - i think i think that'd be freaking sick
40:30 - dude
40:31 - yeah so if you if you join on this call
40:34 - and you let us know that you came from
40:37 - here
40:38 - from this youtube live stream um we can
40:41 - actually set up a one-on-one call like a
40:43 - strategy session for 30 minutes and we
40:45 - can plan out your next 12 months as a
40:47 - developer
40:48 - and exactly what you need to do to get
40:50 - to 100 000 a year mark it might take you
40:52 - six months or 12 months to accomplish
40:54 - this roadmap
40:55 - but i can get on this call and give you
40:58 - the roadmap so
40:59 - like personally designed for you whether
41:00 - you're your i.t job
41:02 - you currently have no job and you're
41:04 - unemployed maybe you currently have a
41:06 - job where you're making 40 or 50 000
41:07 - trying to figure out how to get past a
41:08 - six-figure mark
41:10 - so we can get on that call and we can
41:11 - come up with that strategy i would love
41:13 - to do that with you
41:14 - is it for either option the free trial
41:16 - or the pay or is it just for
41:18 - a specific like if they pay up front
41:19 - then i think let's do a few pre-pay
41:22 - okay i like that right if you if you uh
41:25 - if you pre-pay
41:26 - i think it's better for you because
41:27 - you're going to love the workshop anyway
41:29 - so you'll save
41:30 - 50 bucks uh if you so if you pay up
41:32 - front and then
41:33 - i would be happy to schedule a call with
41:35 - you
41:36 - guys and and again the reason why this
41:38 - workshop is a paid one is because
41:40 - those who pay pay attention guys if you
41:42 - just show up and you think it's free
41:43 - you're not gonna take it serious
41:44 - but if you put some skin in the game you
41:47 - invest into yourself
41:48 - whether it's a course a workshop hey
41:51 - chirok says trunk just joined let's go
41:54 - let's go that's sick call times are 10
41:57 - a.m
41:58 - all right 10 a.m pacific every day
42:01 - friday saturday sunday ishaan says i'm
42:04 - literally shaking that my inspiration
42:06 - said my name that's awesome
42:08 - i love it um
42:11 - okay dope
42:14 - so yes the the call will be live yup yup
42:17 - yup yup
42:18 - live all right so let's go through more
42:20 - of this because i think it's really
42:21 - helpful
42:22 - so second he says know your html
42:25 - so he says if you don't know basic
42:27 - things like you're not using before or
42:29 - after
42:30 - then those are like common red flags so
42:33 - know
42:33 - how html works because jsx even with the
42:36 - rea
42:37 - right when you're writing react you're
42:38 - writing html just like jsx
42:41 - it's still html under the hood it just
42:43 - lets you write it in a way
42:45 - you know where it's like kind of nicer
42:46 - so make sure you know that really really
42:48 - well
42:49 - for sure yeah that'd be like if you
42:51 - didn't that'd be like if you were a
42:52 - basketball player that didn't know how
42:53 - to dribble
42:54 - and get up and down the court like you
42:55 - could shoot but like you can't move
42:58 - unless someone passes it to you and
43:00 - you're basically
43:02 - you don't have those fundamentals right
43:04 - right so get those fundamentals
43:06 - right uh number three he says
43:09 - know your css he goes even if you suck
43:12 - at
43:12 - coding challenges or you suck at hacker
43:15 - rank or lead code
43:16 - and you fail the algorithm round he goes
43:19 - i will still
43:20 - fight for your hire if you really shine
43:23 - through in your css and he goes
43:25 - those css things like absolute
43:26 - positioning or flexbox or basic
43:28 - transformations box models z indexes
43:31 - they are really important for you to
43:33 - know and how they behave
43:35 - in context with each other so if you
43:36 - know those things and you know those
43:38 - subtleties
43:39 - he will pick you even over somebody who
43:41 - knows algorithms inside out
43:43 - and that's huge man the reason being in
43:46 - this world in this day and age
43:48 - ux the user experience is literally
43:52 - above
43:52 - almost i mean obviously there's got to
43:54 - be some functionality but
43:55 - it's up there in the top because no
43:57 - one's going to show up to your website
43:58 - if it's like some crummy old
44:00 - 1990s lots of flashing lights type of
44:03 - website you know what i mean yeah it's
44:04 - got to be something that's nice that's
44:06 - attractive
44:06 - you know like think robin hood i think
44:09 - this awesome llama focus app that we
44:11 - just opened up oh yeah that's
44:12 - just like very clean very nice you know
44:14 - like if this was the thing like the 90s
44:17 - early 2000s website no one would use
44:20 - this
44:20 - man this website is beautiful it's got
44:22 - emojis i'm proud of this guy man oh he's
44:25 - got
44:26 - 100 100 customers how long ago was that
44:28 - post
44:29 - you think he's probably got more now i
44:31 - mean because of that post

50:05 - with the workshop page there's no css
50:11 - robert miller says i come from a
50:12 - technical background but not a
50:14 - coding background used to be a signal
50:17 - intelligence analyst would coding fit me
50:21 - robert well it depends like have you
50:23 - ever coded before at
50:25 - all does it interest you at all
50:28 - one thing i can tell you is there are
50:30 - there's a wide range of people that i
50:32 - have taught
50:33 - and worked in code like to teach them
50:36 - coding
50:37 - i'm not here to convince you that coding
50:39 - is for you okay
50:40 - but i've seen a wide range of people do
50:43 - coding and get into coding from
50:44 - somebody who's a truck driver from
50:46 - somebody who's
50:47 - really good at chess from somebody who's
50:49 - an electrical engineer
50:50 - wants to learn more coding there are
50:52 - people from all walks of life from
50:54 - doctors
50:55 - trying to learn coding so they can solve
50:56 - health problems from
50:58 - scientists trying to learn coding so
51:00 - they can figure out what's happening on
51:01 - different planets
51:02 - and understand how to take data from
51:04 - mars and calculate with it
51:07 - from people who want to become
51:08 - developers and make apps like facebook
51:10 - or instagram
51:12 - um so yeah there's like
51:16 - many many different ways people come
51:20 - about it and people enjoy coding so
51:23 - all i can tell you is if those people
51:26 - have found have been able to enjoy
51:28 - coding
51:30 - i think that if you give it a chance i
51:32 - think you would really really enjoy it
51:34 - and one thing i just want to let you
51:35 - know
51:36 - is most people think that they won't be
51:38 - able to understand coding or somehow
51:40 - get it that's not true that's mostly
51:42 - just because like the people who taught
51:44 - it to you
51:44 - didn't know how to teach it properly or
51:46 - just over complicated the hell out of it
51:49 - if somebody explains it to you in the
51:50 - right way you can like start picking it
51:52 - up and start doing things in
51:54 - as little as one day and it's crazy
51:57 - robert you're really not gonna know
51:58 - whether it's for you or not until you
51:59 - get in there
52:00 - you get dirty with it you start to code
52:03 - i mean like how cos you just said i
52:04 - remember the first time i came across
52:05 - coding was in high school
52:06 - and my teacher sucked like my teacher
52:08 - would just show up and be like hey yeah
52:10 - read the lessons go do your little
52:12 - coding project and turn it in
52:13 - and it was so not enjoyable that i
52:15 - literally hated coding with the passion
52:17 - i was like screw this like i left
52:18 - after just one semester i didn't finish
52:20 - the whole year but later in college i
52:22 - was originally an electrical engineering
52:24 - path and i finished like all my lower
52:26 - courses and i took one programming class
52:28 - and that kind of re-ignited the interest
52:32 - i'm calling preston hopefully he picks
52:34 - up
52:35 - hello how are you doing yo what's up
52:37 - preston how you doing
52:39 - man i'm so glad right before bed i just
52:41 - hopped on youtube randomly and your
52:43 - video was the first one to pop up on my
52:44 - feed
52:45 - yeah it's just i guess the stars just
52:47 - kind of aligned because i can kind of
52:48 - talk to you about
52:49 - what i'm literally doing right now in my
52:50 - job and this fits perfectly
52:52 - i mean i couldn't ask for something
52:54 - better dude that is amazing
52:56 - we just want to say i have bo i have a
52:58 - daniel with me on here
53:00 - i just want to say congratulations for
53:01 - jumping into the react.js workshop
53:04 - and thanks so much for being on this
53:05 - live brother no problem man not a
53:07 - problem
53:08 - yeah man so like it just kind of worked
53:10 - out perfect because uh i'm off for 18
53:13 - days
53:13 - starting on the 18th nice i have all
53:15 - three days free
53:16 - and just you know i've been in it now
53:18 - for about 13 14 years i work at a oil
53:20 - major company
53:21 - and i'm actually a lead on a project for
53:23 - service now nice
53:25 - for operations management and so while
53:27 - i'm not a developer on the team i'm
53:29 - actually
53:29 - what's called a track lead what's the
53:31 - company called by the way
53:33 - excellent oh excel mobile exxonmobil
53:37 - let's go preston and so i'm a product
53:40 - owner you're familiar with like agile
53:41 - terminologies i'm a product owner for
53:43 - something called itsm which is like
53:44 - their ticketing system
53:46 - got it and so um we're switching the
53:48 - service now and
53:50 - um learning javascript learning react
53:54 - that would i'm on a project right now
53:56 - that's going to wrap in a year
53:58 - and the more technical i can get i it
54:01 - almost guarantees me
54:03 - that i'll be a valuable employee
54:04 - literally for the next three or four
54:05 - years just having that skill in and of
54:06 - itself
54:07 - and so what skill is that like technical
54:10 - react skills
54:11 - specifically react skills and javascript
54:13 - skills overall
54:14 - honestly just having the ability to
54:17 - communicate effectively
54:18 - and be like a leader and also be
54:20 - technical
54:21 - that's the most valued person that you
54:22 - can be so what is that
54:24 - worth to you right so for example if you
54:26 - say you can stay
54:27 - if you learn that skill this year and
54:30 - then you can actually have that job for
54:32 - the next three to four years
54:34 - what's the monetary gain that you're
54:36 - potentially looking at over the next
54:37 - three to four years
54:39 - um salary i'd probably say an extra 35
54:42 - to 55 000.
54:44 - wow extra which would to your total
54:46 - company yeah over at and so i mean at
54:47 - that point
54:48 - because how you're paid it's it's comp
54:50 - it looks like a whole formula but i mean
54:52 - basically you're looking at if you're
54:53 - making say
54:55 - a hundred thousand you're going from 100
54:56 - to 150 or if you're already making 150
54:58 - you're going from 150 to 200.
55:00 - and do you mind me asking you how much
55:02 - are you making currently at this job
55:05 - uh north of 115.
55:08 - there you go so so with learning
55:11 - a huge thing so learning these skills
55:13 - might be able to take you from making
55:15 - 115k
55:16 - or 120k a year to potentially 150k
55:19 - or more or more and as a matter of fact
55:22 - i'm inclined to say more because if you
55:23 - have those communication skills
55:25 - yeah now i'll be able to talk to an
55:27 - entire different audience of architects
55:29 - and process owners
55:30 - and have those in-depth conversations
55:32 - where right now i may shy away from that
55:33 - because i can't have that kind of
55:34 - conversation
55:35 - and so it's not just the monetary gain
55:38 - it's like literally you can be in a role
55:40 - that i wouldn't have qualified for
55:41 - before
55:44 - that is massive and i think something
55:45 - huge that you talked about their preston
55:48 - is you're starting to think long term
55:50 - right sometimes people just think
55:51 - like in talking in terms of monetary
55:53 - sometimes people just think like oh i
55:54 - have to pay
55:55 - i don't know maybe twenty thousand
55:56 - dollars for this boot camp and i get a
55:58 - job that's like i don't know maybe
55:59 - eighty thousand dollars or a hundred
56:00 - thousand dollars for the year but they
56:02 - don't think like you like
56:03 - three years five years those things add
56:06 - up if you have a six-figure job
56:08 - for five years that adds up beyond if
56:11 - you're able to get a 30
56:12 - on that 50 increase on that for the next
56:15 - three to five years
56:16 - those things add up and that's just the
56:17 - monetary like you said even more
56:19 - the skill that you get from that the
56:21 - teams are gonna get to collaborate with
56:23 - the opportunities that you're gonna get
56:25 - just snowball effect into allowing you
56:28 - to be
56:28 - in an amazing position in five years
56:31 - exactly
56:32 - and and i will say to you that most
56:33 - people in my position right because i'm
56:35 - 41 i don't even count anymore 41 42.
56:37 - yeah so most people that are my age
56:39 - right they would not
56:42 - they would think about trying to get
56:44 - this knowledge a completely different
56:45 - way they would be shelling out two three
56:46 - four thousand dollars probably going to
56:48 - a camp for a week having the company
56:49 - reimburse them
56:50 - and a lot of people just don't even
56:52 - realize that these kind of resources are
56:53 - available and
56:54 - basically you're offering this value at
56:56 - a fraction of that cost
56:58 - um it'll show me like you said it's
56:59 - going to show me whether this is
57:01 - something that i should pursue further
57:02 - which i already know that it is yeah
57:04 - um and it's something that i can start
57:05 - literally like in two days
57:07 - i mean it's a no-brainer that's amazing
57:10 - dude
57:10 - i'm so excited to see you on the call on
57:14 - friday and work with you friday saturday
57:16 - sunday i know nas would be so
57:18 - pumped as well just tell me how long
57:20 - have you been following
57:21 - uh clever programmer i think i first
57:25 - subscribed and noticed you guys or
57:27 - gotten you know
57:28 - uh saw you guys were about four months
57:30 - ago yeah i think i have some
57:32 - i feel like i remember your name in our
57:34 - live streams i used to see you pop up
57:36 - unless i'm mistaken
57:38 - no you're not mistaken i wasn't super
57:40 - active yeah because i will say like
57:42 - youtube is my primary media consumption
57:43 - so i subscribe to somewhere in the north
57:45 - of like 800 to a thousand channels
57:47 - wow so like my youtube feed is insane
57:50 - but i do it on purpose so that it's kind
57:51 - of surprising
57:52 - but your channel has won for the last
57:54 - few months where i i kind of make it a
57:56 - point
57:56 - to check in weekly or every other week
57:59 - why is that and so
58:01 - because the way that my career has kind
58:03 - of been going
58:04 - i know i need to change and just the way
58:06 - you guys talk it and focus on
58:09 - execution there's no fluff yeah so i you
58:12 - know what i mean
58:13 - you have to promote yourself which i
58:14 - understand but you're really just about
58:17 - learning and being able to execute on
58:18 - the knowledge you have as quickly as
58:20 - possible
58:20 - yeah and you just because no thrill that
58:22 - you just get right to it
58:24 - and you're relatable and so when i see
58:26 - those kind of things i just jump
58:27 - awesome thank you man i appreciate that
58:29 - and last question preston for somebody
58:31 - who's on the fence thinking about
58:32 - joining this workshop but maybe they're
58:34 - just like on the fence
58:36 - would you recommend to them or like what
58:38 - would you say to them to join this
58:40 - workshop
58:43 - what i should say is that something i
58:46 - struggled with when i was early like a
58:47 - lot of people on the call may be a teen
58:49 - maybe in their 20s 30s i mean i've been
58:51 - there
58:52 - and a lot of times learning something
58:55 - like this learning a new skill
58:57 - it may be intimidating right and that
59:01 - that intimidation will hold you back and
59:03 - let me just put it to you guys that are
59:05 - younger as a person that's
59:06 - kind of mid-career i regret
59:09 - every single time i let something that
59:11 - might be somewhat intimidating hold me
59:13 - back
59:13 - and it is always better to take the leap
59:15 - and learn
59:17 - than to regret wow and if you have
59:20 - someone like you guys that are
59:23 - that are offering something that's it's
59:26 - so valuable
59:27 - for such a small price it's it's not
59:30 - worth taking the risk of not doing it
59:33 - yeah you might as well it's only upside
59:36 - wow
59:36 - dude that is deep and powerful man then
59:39 - preston we really appreciate you
59:41 - opening up man like being that
59:42 - vulnerable but if that's your truth that

63:40 - one
63:40 - together with my brother how cool would
63:42 - be like if your brother coded
63:44 - you guys both coded a problem why don't
63:46 - we code something
63:47 - dude we should code something bro just
63:49 - for fun like just for shits and giggles
63:52 - like the llama application dude like he
63:54 - did it for his phone probably some sort
63:55 - of productivity thing you know yeah
63:58 - that'd be really cool nas is down for
64:01 - sure
64:02 - yeah like just some fun project right
64:04 - like imagine that we get kyle to record
64:07 - us and we just spend eight hours and
64:08 - let's just see what we do
64:09 - whole little hackathon yeah like a
64:11 - hackathon
64:12 - all right dude i'm down for that that'd
64:14 - be sick right
64:15 - let's go nas sneeze if you could hear us
64:18 - we just thought about it nas and we're
64:20 - like
64:22 - [Laughter]
64:25 - we just came up with a random idea and
64:27 - we said how about if we do
64:29 - you know i was like yo let's just sit
64:32 - together one day just code for like
64:33 - seven eight hours and he's like oh dope
64:35 - and he's like now nas would be down for
64:37 - that and then we thought
64:38 - yo what if we just got together and he
64:41 - came up with the idea of like hackathon
64:43 - which is in a hackathon kyle recorded it
64:45 - and then he vlogged it and we put it up
64:47 - on youtube
64:49 - would you be down yeah all right
64:59 - in the back grinding away at the
65:01 - workshop training
65:02 - so he's going to be up today until 2 or
65:04 - 3 a.m tomorrow is probably also going to
65:06 - be up until 2 or 3 a.m
65:08 - and uh i'm gonna work with him right
65:10 - after this live

65:16 - i'm working actually
65:18 - on the amazon clone i'm making making
65:20 - sure that it looks
65:21 - amazing and that you guys have a project
65:24 - where you will learn so much
65:26 - and not only that that will also attract
65:29 - a lot
65:29 - both of you need to be a lot closer to
65:31 - the mic what
65:32 - a lot more potential though a project
65:35 - that will attract
65:36 - a lot of potential jobs how does that
65:39 - sound

66:12 - we like
66:14 - start learning like react live and
66:17 - coding up you know what i mean dude
66:19 - i think it'd be dope if we look stupid
66:21 - in front of people so they realize
66:22 - that's not and they don't have that like
66:24 - fear of looking stupid
66:25 - that's what i'm saying yeah

68:34 - complete
68:35 - crazy project this was normally like
68:37 - literally i was thinking of second
68:38 - students
68:39 - this would normally take you days weeks
68:42 - months sometimes to do right but the
68:45 - cool thing of like sitting down and just
68:47 - focusing non-stop for three days
68:50 - to complete something epic that could
68:52 - potentially change your life
68:54 - like that to me is so exciting guys
68:58 - like because in the day if you do focus
69:00 - and just challenge yourself it's like
69:02 - think of this as this it's literally
69:04 - like a challenge to you
69:06 - it's like a challenge for yourself can
69:08 - you do it in three days
69:09 - i know you can and you will because

69:36 - if you like for example right what do
69:38 - most of us do on a saturday friday
69:40 - saturday sunday
69:41 - some of us watch netflix and chill
69:44 - and relax and before you know it the
69:47 - weekend is over
69:49 - now what if on that same weekend like
69:50 - one of the things that i would pitch to
69:52 - my clients
69:53 - uh they would pay me like you know one
69:55 - of the clients paid between 10 to 25 000
69:57 - for three days because i told them look
70:00 - these three days you're gonna do
70:01 - nothing but in these three days we could
70:04 - just build a full product for you and
70:06 - launch it
70:07 - and he was like okay let's do it
70:10 - the same thing i feel here most of us
70:13 - on friday saturday sunday they just pass
70:16 - nothing happens on this friday saturday
70:18 - sunday
70:18 - you get to completely change your career
70:22 - as a developer
70:24 - and launch your career and just kick
70:26 - start the hell out of it and potentially
70:28 - get a job with it so that's kind of the
70:29 - crazy
70:30 - thing about it and why do we say you
70:31 - could literally kicks your career that's
70:33 - because
70:33 - what you're doing this weekend is you're
70:35 - gonna build a bunch of
70:37 - assets right an asset is something that
70:39 - you could leverage
70:40 - to help you make money to help you move
70:42 - forward in life whatever that is so what
70:44 - are these assets
70:45 - you're going to build an amazing amazon
70:47 - clone here
70:49 - with that you're also going to learn how
70:50 - to do react.js
70:52 - you're going to develop those skills
70:53 - that are basically an asset you're going
70:55 - to develop
70:55 - a portfolio which you could show to
70:58 - potential people that might hire you
71:00 - that's another asset you're going to
71:01 - build a network
71:03 - of like-minded individuals people who
71:05 - are just trying to level up the game
71:06 - people who aren't spending their
71:08 - weekends watching netflix
71:09 - but on this workshop these are types of
71:12 - assets that you're gonna have
71:14 - by being part of this workshop and going
71:16 - up showing up and playing all out in
71:19 - this workshop
71:19 - with those things that is how you get to
71:22 - jumpstart your career
71:24 - yep this app is pretty cool project home

71:34 -  dude
71:37 - project home is the only housing group
71:39 - you need we build project home out of
71:41 - assuming the current products on the
71:42 - market simply want to solve a rental
71:43 - property search and roommate search

71:46 - oh wow so roommate search with
71:50 - apartment renting type searching

73:57 - learn
73:57 - react like live
74:01 - oh it's actually pretty dope like
74:03 - you have a coding area or what
74:06 - what do you mean you get to learn react
74:07 - live you get to learn react
74:10 - um so when you're watching videos right

74:55 - to show you okay so let's say that
74:58 - we go to working with uh apis right
75:02 - and let's just pick uh any lesson and
75:04 - let's go to
75:05 - responses
75:09 - what the
75:16 - so
75:19 - let's just find i'm i'm just trying to
75:21 - find like uh
75:24 - there's a free one they have a bunch of
75:25 - free ones so hey everyone and welcome to
75:28 - uh because we are going to build a react
75:31 - movie search
75:32 - app obviously basically
75:36 - oh god just so you build out a project
75:39 - they have the tutorial videos for you
75:41 - it's like it's like almost the clones we
75:43 - have no but
75:45 - here's the cool part about it this is
75:59 - you can actually run the code here set
76:01 - up the console
76:03 - hey this is
76:17 - so he's screen recording here right i
76:19 - just paused his video and i can actually
76:21 - now code right there
76:25 - that's what the i'm saying bro so
76:28 - like look i can just code right there
76:30 - video is paused as soon as i start
76:32 - playing his videos
76:36 - search movies so like i can go
76:39 - search movies and write that
76:43 - and the and i can run the code too and
76:45 - see what happens
76:51 - that's nuts dude this is mind-blowing
76:54 - bro
76:54 - that's what i'm saying so you can
76:55 - actually pick up so much uh from doing
76:58 - this
76:59 - because the live i'm just trying to
77:02 - think of how the hell that's programmed
77:03 - like they literally
77:07 - like they literally have to match
77:08 - whatever is in the video at the typing
77:10 - speed that they have because at any
77:11 - moment you could press on it
77:13 - and then switch over to the the what do
77:15 - we call this the code area
77:17 - yeah code editor the code the code
77:19 - editor damn bro
77:21 - it's been a while shloka says just join
77:24 - right now let's go
77:25 - yo
77:28 - if you just joined right now let's try
77:31 - to get someone else on the call
77:32 - let's see what let's see what happens
77:34 - yeah if they join they'll message me my
77:36 - money
77:36 - they know how to message my money hey
77:39 - bro
77:40 - i want to know where your motivation
77:42 - comes from yo
77:43 - you want to answer that one uh where
77:45 - does my motivation come from
77:47 - um
77:51 - budgie so
77:56 - it's a tough question i mean
78:01 - i just like doing like i i enjoy
78:04 - doing and um
78:09 - yeah like the whole world feels kind of
78:11 - like a playground to me
78:12 - so it's it's fun and it's exciting and
78:15 - uh
78:16 - i always just want to be exploring new
78:19 - opportunities new things that are
78:20 - happening
78:22 - now as i'm growing older my motivation
78:25 - is also coming
78:26 - from my team that i have my friends that
78:28 - i have my girlfriend
78:30 - um my motivation comes from making sure
78:33 - that my team is taken care of
78:35 - that's kind of like sometimes external
78:36 - motivation and other a lot of other
78:38 - times just my main
78:40 - source of motivation honestly is i'll
78:43 - pick
78:44 - things that i don't know if they're
78:46 - possible or are extremely challenging
78:48 - and then i just think and i'm like holy
78:51 -  can i do this
78:52 - can we do this can we pull this off i
78:55 - don't know if we can do this or not i'm
78:56 - going to wake up tomorrow and i'm going
78:58 - to check it out and see if we can do
78:59 - this or not
79:00 - so a lot of my motivation actually comes
79:02 - from
79:04 - not knowing if something is possible and
79:06 - then putting in the work to do it which
79:07 - is why
79:08 - a lot of times i even like coding
79:10 - because
79:11 - i'll pick a project that i'm not sure if
79:13 - i can do
79:14 - or like we can put together a complete
79:17 - and then we get to work
79:18 - and the whole time i'm just thinking are
79:20 - we gonna get this done or not
79:22 - you know and then from there figure it
79:23 - out and then when you figure it out just
79:25 - like
79:26 - amazing it's the best thing yeah but
79:28 - it's like the the
79:30 - journey of figuring it out is what's
79:32 - absolutely incredible
79:34 - that's the part that i actually really
79:36 - enjoy um
