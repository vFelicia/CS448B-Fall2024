00:00 - look normally i'm always talking to you
00:02 - about the fun stuff with
00:04 - coding javascript what's possible for
00:07 - you
00:08 - how you can actually get those dream
00:10 - jobs and make all of those things happen
00:12 - today that's not what i'm here to talk
00:14 - to you about
00:16 - today i want to talk to you about some
00:18 - of the harsh
00:19 - realities and the real truths
00:23 - behind the world of coding and what it
00:25 - actually takes for you to succeed
00:28 - and why a lot of you will actually fail
00:30 - in your pursuit of becoming a developer
00:33 - or getting a job as a developer and why
00:35 - many of you will actually quit
00:37 - today i want to talk about the dark side
00:39 - of javascript
00:41 - the dark side of coding in general
00:45 - and give you the real tools you actually
00:47 - need because if you
00:48 - understand these hard truths things that
00:51 - seem so
00:52 - difficult right now and hard to hear
00:55 - but if you actually understand these
00:57 - these will help you succeed in the long
00:58 - run
00:59 - i promise all right so i'm gonna
01:02 - go through these and i hope that you get
01:05 - value out of this
01:06 - and learn so right before we jump into
01:09 - this video
01:10 - i want you to do me a favor just go
01:11 - ahead and smash that like button
01:13 - so this video just starts going on to
01:15 - more people so
01:17 - turn it into that blue thing okay and
01:20 - once that happens we're good to go can't
01:23 - subscribe to the channel because this is
01:24 - a channel where we talk about all things
01:26 - javascript react and full stack
01:28 - development
01:29 - cool all right so
01:33 - let's just chat about this right what is
01:36 - this dark side of javascript what are we
01:38 - talking about here
01:41 - [Music]
01:42 - so a few things i want to talk about why
01:45 - a lot of people fail
01:47 - is most people think that they can just
01:50 - go through
01:52 - tutorial after tutorial and once they do
01:55 - that
01:56 - once they just go in this like weird
01:57 - cycle of watching this tutorial right
01:59 - here
02:00 - then watching another one right here and
02:02 - then watching another one right here
02:05 - you'll feel like you're making progress
02:06 - and then actually what's happening
02:08 - is you're just going in these circles
02:12 - and you're not actually making the
02:16 - forward progress you want to make you're
02:17 - not going in the straight line
02:19 - that you want to be going in okay so
02:22 - we don't want this blob of mess what we
02:24 - actually want
02:25 - is that straight path where you're
02:28 - actually making progress
02:30 - okay and this happens for a lot of you
02:34 - and a lot of you are stuck in that and a
02:35 - lot of you don't know how to get out of
02:37 - that a lot of you have trouble writing
02:38 - actual code from scratch
02:40 - i know this because even when we were
02:41 - doing a
02:44 - the live boot camp that we recently did
02:46 - a lot of you came in
02:47 - and you know when we asked you these
02:49 - questions everybody's
02:50 - hands went up we had like 500 people
02:53 - live and we asked you
02:55 - do you feel stuck in coding do you have
02:57 - problems when you have to do things from
02:59 - scratch and literally everybody's hands
03:00 - went up
03:01 - right so when that happens that means
03:03 - it's a problem and we need to actually
03:04 - do something to resolve it
03:07 - so a couple of things i want to talk
03:09 - about okay
03:12 - you are not going to succeed in the
03:15 - world of coding
03:16 - if you're not putting in time okay so i
03:18 - like to always start off with this
03:21 - i will keep coming back to this
03:24 - because it's a skill skills
03:27 - don't necessarily have that much
03:29 - leverage like you can't have
03:31 - you can't hire another person and then
03:33 - have them just learn the skill
03:36 - and you get the benefit it doesn't work
03:37 - like that because if it did
03:40 - i'd have like i'd hire like 10
03:42 - bodybuilders
03:44 - and then just have them work on their
03:46 - body and then mine would start growing
03:49 - you know but it doesn't work like that
03:52 - it's
03:52 - there's no leverage there for me which
03:54 - means i have to actually put in that
03:56 - time i have to put in those hours
03:58 - i have to wake up early i have to put in
04:00 - the work and acquire that skill
04:02 - so understand that um
04:04 - [Music]
04:05 - okay let's just say coding is a skill
04:08 - and it
04:09 - takes time slash hours
04:12 - okay of course some people are going to
04:15 - naturally be better at it than you are
04:17 - okay there were some there's some people
04:19 - who are genetically
04:20 - wired for this and you're not gonna beat
04:23 - them
04:23 - you're not going to beat those people
04:26 - they're people
04:27 - who do the google freaking if you go on
04:28 - youtube right now there are these
04:30 - kids who are 17 year olds and they're
04:33 - winning
04:33 - the first place in some crazy google
04:36 - competition
04:37 - they will beat everybody they were wired
04:40 - for scientific thinking
04:42 - mathematical concepts engineering
04:45 - software development there were wired
04:47 - for that
04:47 - okay so there are going to be always
04:50 - some people that are better than you
04:51 - at this but one thing that is in your
04:54 - control and the reason why i talk about
04:56 - look at coding
04:57 - as a skill or javascript as a skill
05:00 - because a lot of the results you're
05:03 - gonna get are
05:04 - based on the time and hours that you put
05:06 - in
05:08 - okay and um here's how i describe it
05:10 - right so for example if it's
05:12 - about time and hours this is why they
05:13 - even say you know if you put in 10 000
05:15 - hours into something
05:17 - you can be a professional cool now just
05:20 - to put it in perspective what that
05:21 - really means is if
05:23 - you put in 10 hours per day into
05:25 - javascript okay and to learn in coding
05:27 - you put in 10 hours
05:28 - per day well
05:32 - uh generally you know you're not going
05:36 - to go for 30
05:37 - days a month because there's always
05:40 - something that
05:41 - happens so you're not always going to go
05:43 - 30 days per month
05:44 - all right so instead what will likely
05:47 - happen is let's just say you do it for
05:49 - 20 days a month okay discounting for
05:52 - weekends
05:53 - some other time you know downtime family
05:56 - time blah blah
05:56 - okay so you do it 10 hours 20 days per
06:00 - month
06:02 - and if we multiply that by
06:05 - you know 12 12
06:08 - 12 times because there's 12 months the
06:11 - whole year
06:14 - what you actually get is
06:17 - let's write that down here
06:20 - this is going to be about 2400 hours
06:28 - okay so if you did 10 hours of coding
06:32 - 20 days a month for 12 months
06:36 - you would have 2 400 hours of coding
06:38 - under your belt
06:41 - when you have this hour this many hours
06:43 - of coding
06:44 - there there's certain things just to
06:46 - statistically work
06:47 - even if you're slower than other people
06:49 - even if your math isn't that strong
06:52 - you're going to get to a certain level
06:54 - of competence
06:55 - and this level of competence in the job
06:58 - world
06:59 - see i'm from the chess world so we have
07:01 - elo systems and we have ratings
07:03 - right for example you'll have people
07:06 - have a rating of
07:07 - 600 when you start like my girlfriend
07:10 - just started playing chess she just
07:11 - learned the rules
07:12 - she's probably a 600. i've never seen
07:14 - anybody that was under a 600
07:16 - okay then you can go up to a thousand
07:21 - uh club players are about like 1200
07:24 - rated
07:25 - then you have you know 2 000 as an
07:28 - expert i'm about two thousand
07:30 - and then you have these like freaks who
07:34 - are
07:34 - 24 25 hundreds they're called ims
07:38 - okay and then you have the
07:41 - gm's in chess and then past
07:44 - gm's so let's go here they're like 2700
07:48 - um 2600 and then past gm's is like 2700
07:53 - they're super gms and
07:55 - that's pretty much the highest you can
07:57 - ever achieve in chess you know 2830
07:59 - whatever was
08:00 - the top rating carlson has ever had
08:03 - magnus carlsen is the number one player
08:04 - in the world
08:05 - so what i like about this elo system is
08:08 - it's very accurate
08:11 - so where i would put you on this elo
08:14 - system and and how it works is the first
08:17 - ratings are really easy to get
08:19 - going from 600 to 1000 might take you
08:23 - let's say two months of solid focus in
08:25 - chess
08:27 - but going from let's say 1600
08:30 - to 2000 might take you four years
08:34 - okay and for me to go from 2000 to like
08:37 - 2500 might take me like 10 years or five
08:39 - years
08:40 - of just like focused full-time work
08:44 - so it gets progressively harder
08:47 - for for a lot of you you know after you
08:50 - put in 24
08:51 - 2400 hours into coding i would i would
08:54 - say that you get to about
08:56 - 1200 rated or 1400 rated player
08:59 - okay and salary wise what this might
09:02 - equate to
09:03 - is a junior developer
09:06 - making about let's say
09:10 - 60 000 plus
09:14 - okay that's i think what that might
09:16 - equate to
09:18 - now um so just out of curiosity
09:22 - you know where would you place yourself
09:24 - on
09:25 - this scale i i know i put it in hours
09:27 - but as a junior developer generally no
09:29 - skills uh like apis you know
09:33 - skills like back-end development
09:34 - front-end development you know how to
09:36 - deal with the
09:37 - database like firebase mysql you know
09:40 - how to deal with the front-end
09:41 - you know how to use react to build
09:43 - web-based components
09:46 - forms logins user authentication
09:50 - things of that nature okay
09:53 - now so yeah maybe comment below what
09:56 - rating you think you
09:57 - are because i would like to get a sense
09:59 - of where you guys are all at and be
10:00 - honest the people who are the worst
10:03 - usually i call them i have a term i call
10:05 - it the cafeteria champions
10:07 - okay these are the people that
10:10 - think they're the best in chess
10:14 - but they've never competed actually
10:16 - they've never actually been to
10:18 - real competitions so for example you
10:20 - know i love my dad but
10:22 - he falls under this category and they
10:24 - just beat the people that are nearby
10:26 - them or maybe they're your
10:27 - uh friendly school cafeteria beating
10:30 - everybody there
10:31 - okay so i call them cafeteria champions
10:36 - and they're generally rated about a
10:38 - thousand or under okay my dad is about a
10:40 - thousand
10:41 - or under that i you know not trying to
10:44 - knock on my dad i love my dad i learned
10:46 - chess from him and i actually started
10:48 - playing because of him
10:50 - and started competing because of him and
10:51 - one of my goals was to
10:53 - get as good as him one day so
10:56 - that's where a lot of so yeah so you
10:59 - know but cafeteria champions think
11:01 - they're like 2500s
11:04 - you know and that's how you can spot a
11:05 - cafeteria champion they'll often be like
11:07 - oh i'm the best you know nobody can beat
11:08 - me i'm so good
11:10 - so don't be a cafeteria champion be real
11:13 - okay be real the good players are often
11:15 - like oh i suck i'm 1200 and they're
11:18 - usually
11:18 - beasts you know they're a little beat
11:20 - most people they'll be like i'm
11:22 - um 1800 the more the better you get it
11:24 - the more you
11:25 - like even in jiu jitsu and fighting the
11:27 - better you get at fighting
11:29 - the more you realize how badass
11:31 - everybody else is because there's always
11:33 - somebody better than you
11:34 - at the jujutsu gym so people who are
11:37 - actual fighters
11:38 - they pick the least amount of fights
11:41 - because they know
11:42 - that there are levels to this
11:45 - so same thing so put a rating that you
11:47 - actually think you are genuinely
11:49 - and put a you know put your skill level
11:53 - and whatever okay
11:54 - so that's that's kind of what would
11:55 - happen if you put in 2 400 hours
11:59 - um i think if you put in 10 000 hours
12:03 - then you start to get to this this
12:06 - area between you know the 2000 and plus
12:10 - area and that's where things explode
12:14 - that's when you become disproportional
12:15 - right so for example yesterday
12:17 - in chess i broke 2100 which means in
12:20 - bullet chess
12:21 - and it said that i was better than 93
12:23 - percent of the population
12:26 - um and there were 340 000 bullet players
12:29 - that just played last week so that means
12:31 - that i was
12:31 - better than 315 000.
12:35 - when you fall into that category
12:38 - that's when things explode because
12:41 - majority of the world is behind you
12:44 - now you actually have a very real
12:46 - competitive edge
12:48 - when you're playing a game of skill and
12:49 - you're not playing a game of leverage
12:51 - you're not trying to grow a business
12:52 - you're trying to grow your value as a
12:54 - developer to a company
12:56 - then you have that you can't you can't
12:58 - skip skill it doesn't matter how good
13:00 - your soft skills are it doesn't matter
13:02 - how great of a human being you are
13:03 - it doesn't matter how great your
13:05 - personality is how likable you are
13:07 - if you don't have your skill you're just
13:10 - there's nothing
13:11 - like if i'm building a team of chess and
13:13 - we're going to compete
13:14 - i'm not gonna take anybody that's under
13:16 - a thousand or two thousand
13:18 - that's not gonna happen it doesn't
13:19 - matter if a thousand comes up to me and
13:22 - they're like hey but i'm a nice person
13:23 - i don't care that's great but
13:26 - it doesn't matter you need a certain
13:28 - level of competency to hang around
13:30 - and and be with us otherwise you can't
13:32 - be there
13:33 - right so in the world of coding and
13:35 - software development you have to have
13:37 - a certain level of competency otherwise
13:41 - it's nothing it doesn't mean anything
13:43 - it's meaningless cool
13:45 - so but once you get into that 93
13:49 - now you're into the top percentile of
13:51 - the world now
13:52 - beautiful things start happening now
13:54 - what happens is
13:56 - that your salaries are going to start
14:00 - being disproportional
14:01 - too okay so for example this is an
14:03 - average salary of an
14:05 - average developer which most of you will
14:07 - go on to become how do i know just
14:09 - because statistically speaking
14:12 - most of you are going to be average all
14:14 - right that's just
14:15 - that's what that's the definition of
14:16 - average okay
14:18 - and then there are going to be very few
14:20 - of you that are going to be
14:21 - disproportionately
14:23 - bad or disproportionately really great
14:28 - and my hope is that you fall in that
14:29 - disproportionately great category
14:32 - because when you join that category now
14:35 - beautiful things start to happen instead
14:37 - of a 60
14:38 - 000 average salary you start breaking
14:41 - into the
14:44 - 90k or the 100
14:48 - k salaries okay and if you're really
14:52 - talking about 93
14:53 - well in the world of development what
14:55 - that actually looks like is
14:57 - between 200 000 to
15:00 - 300 000 that's what happens when you
15:02 - become
15:04 - that's what happens when you get into
15:05 - this this this range the 2100 range the
15:08 - 93
15:09 - range and it's not far-fetched i'm not
15:12 - making random up netflix engineers
15:14 - friend developers make 300 000.
15:16 - snapchat software developers made 250.
15:20 - um so that's what's required but that's
15:24 - but the dark side is the amount of hours
15:26 - you're willing to put in
15:27 - the amount of hours you're willing to
15:29 - sacrifice away from friends
15:31 - away from sometimes even family members
15:34 - away from
15:35 - the people that you love but that's why
15:38 - you
15:38 - really have to have a passion for it
15:39 - where you have to enjoy it to the point
15:41 - where you're willing to actually do that
15:45 - you know because if you're not you're
15:47 - not going to get into that category and
15:49 - then just don't have those goals
15:50 - like don't have fake goals that's where
15:53 - unhappiness comes from when you have
15:55 - goals that you
15:56 - you think like when you think you're
15:58 - 2100
16:00 - and you tell yourself you are but then
16:02 - you're like why am i not making 300k
16:04 - you start to go crazy that's where
16:06 - unhappiness comes from
16:08 - but if you know that your ambition is of
16:10 - a 1200
16:11 - and you know currently you're at a
16:13 - thousand and you know when you get to
16:15 - 1200 you'll be happy with the 60 000
16:18 - salary then just focus on being happy
16:22 - and then do that make sure your
16:24 - ambitions match
16:25 - where you want to get to okay because
16:29 - then you actually will have a happy life
16:32 - but the the truth is that the people who
16:34 - are winning and becoming
16:36 - great they're just spending ridiculous
16:38 - amount of time
16:39 - coding and i will tell this to all of
16:41 - you you know especially the ones of you
16:43 - that are older
16:44 - that are you know 30 and beyond
16:48 - you're not that old but i'm saying older
16:50 - right not
16:51 - not a 10 year old or a 14 year old
16:53 - because when you're 10
16:54 - 14 15 18 it's really easy to just go all
16:57 - in
16:58 - as you start to get older you have a lot
17:00 - of responsibilities in your life which
17:02 - makes it difficult
17:04 - but you still have to find ways
17:07 - okay and if you can do 10 hours find
17:10 - something that works i'm not saying you
17:11 - won't make it
17:13 - okay but what i am saying is that
17:16 - it'll take longer all right
17:20 - it'll just take longer and that's really
17:23 - uh that's really it but
17:26 - if you become really good if you become
17:29 - disproportionately good you will get
17:30 - disproportionately
17:32 - good results okay that's where
17:35 - that's where the level of skill matters
17:38 - and the skill is developed
17:41 - well you know just like uh for
17:44 - bodybuilding your muscles are developed
17:45 - based on the time under tension
17:49 - right you're doing the curls and it's
17:51 - just that
17:52 - the time under the tension that's
17:55 - what that's where the software
17:57 - development skill comes in the time
17:58 - under tension of your brain being flexed
18:00 - and you thinking in your problem solving
18:04 - okay so if i got rid of all of this
18:12 - right and we had
18:15 - something like this let's say
18:20 - okay let's just say this is somebody's
18:24 - career this is an average person's
18:28 - career this is a below average person's
18:30 - career and then this is
18:32 - a above average person's career
18:37 - okay really the biggest differentiation
18:41 - here this these gaps here
18:44 - okay and these gaps here
18:47 - for majority of the times majority of
18:50 - the times the one reproducible thing
18:53 - you can boil this down to is
18:57 - hours that's it yes there
19:00 - are other factors like intelligence
19:02 - there are other factors
19:04 - like what they did previously
19:07 - there are other factors that are part of
19:10 - this you know if somebody went to mit
19:12 - or freaking harvard and just had better
19:14 - education
19:15 - it'll help to have that as when they
19:17 - come into these things they'll have
19:19 - better design ways of thinking about
19:21 - this they'll have an advantage
19:22 - that's true 100 true for example if
19:26 - people who've done who were farmers
19:29 - their whole lives or who are
19:30 - construction workers or who are
19:32 - basketball players
19:33 - you know when they go in my one rep max
19:37 - of a deadlift after years and years and
19:39 - years and years and years of training is
19:41 - 305
19:43 - but a basketball player who's been
19:44 - playing basketball and never lifted
19:46 - weights
19:46 - goes in they just start off with the 250
19:48 - or 315
19:49 - pound deadlift so why
19:54 - because they did things that that moved
19:56 - them forward in that direction
19:58 - right so they're more likely to be good
20:01 - at those things
20:04 - so here that little difference that i'm
20:06 - highlighting
20:07 - this here and this here just boils down
20:10 - to hours majority of the times
20:13 - take taking away a lot of the other
20:14 - advantages hours
20:18 - will help you overcome almost
20:22 - any of the problems if you're a lot
20:24 - dumber than somebody else if you just
20:25 - put in more hours
20:27 - you will become smarter than them and
20:30 - you will
20:31 - solve the things that they were having
20:33 - struggle that they
20:34 - they were struggling with okay um
20:39 - if somebody grasps something in an hour
20:42 - and it takes you three hours
20:44 - but if you spend now four hours now
20:46 - you'll have
20:48 - at the three hour mark you'll match
20:50 - their understanding and at the fourth
20:51 - hour mark you will surpass their
20:52 - understanding and you will be now in the
20:54 - next level of understanding
20:56 - so these are
20:59 - key differentiators now i'm not saying
21:02 - learning in an intelligent way isn't
21:04 - going to help you
21:05 - practicing being mindful having a good
21:07 - learning strategy all of those are of
21:09 - course going to help you
21:10 - but learning is just one of those things
21:12 - that it does take time and a lot of
21:15 - effort and
21:15 - hours whether you're trying to learn
21:17 - soccer or ping pong whatever it is
21:19 - okay if you can get coaching then great
21:23 - you get super charged if you get
21:25 - coaching then
21:26 - these hours that you put in are
21:28 - maximized which means
21:30 - the results you would get in four hours
21:31 - now you get in two
21:33 - okay and what this basically means
21:37 - is there's a difference of hours here
21:41 - okay in this lower category between you
21:44 - know let's say below average
21:46 - and me mediocre and average and then
21:49 - above average right excellent
21:51 - so in this in this category right here
21:55 - there is a difference of hours but
21:57 - there's also a difference of salaries
21:59 - for example uh this person here
22:03 - probably makes 30k a year this person
22:07 - here probably makes 60k a year
22:10 - and then this person here probably makes
22:13 - 180k a year
22:16 - okay it's
22:19 - it's crazy but once you get good you
22:21 - take over like look at the
22:22 - look at the job okay let me put it this
22:25 - way
22:27 - look at how businesses are structured
22:30 - the business that wins first place
22:31 - just eats every other business like
22:35 - eats all of them
22:38 - when somebody becomes the number one in
22:40 - the market think for example
22:42 - amazon in online e-commerce nobody comes
22:45 - to even close they're just
22:47 - wiped out like if amazon is doing a
22:48 - trillion then they're the second person
22:50 - is doing a billion
22:52 - okay it's it's just it's the magnitudes
22:54 - of orders of difference
22:59 - so with with becoming disproportionately
23:03 - good you get disproportionately great
23:04 - results
23:06 - okay and the key differentiator between
23:09 - those salaries between this salary
23:12 - this salary this salary one reproducible
23:15 - thing
23:16 - one thing that you we all have under our
23:18 - control is ours
23:23 - and the people that are putting in more
23:25 - time more effort more energy more hours
23:28 - are getting the bigger results so
23:31 - that's one key thing now
23:35 - you can have extraordinary results right
23:38 - you can have
23:39 - this curve here like a
23:42 - like a hockey thing this weird hockey
23:45 - thing
23:46 - right and this hockey thing can happen
23:51 - when you are putting in hours
23:54 - um i think about it like this
23:57 - when i was getting better at chess and
23:59 - learning chess there were other people
24:01 - uh like like for example let's take a
24:03 - wonder who i played
24:05 - and he was this kid that had to
24:09 - stand on top of this little six-year-old
24:12 - that beat me at the time when i was a
24:13 - 2000 rated player i was at my peak and i
24:16 - was crushing everybody and i was
24:17 - ferocious
24:19 - he would stand up on his chair play me
24:22 - because he was so chubby and cute and
24:24 - fat and short
24:25 - he couldn't like reach the pieces so he
24:28 - would stand up on his chair
24:29 - to reach across play the moves and he
24:32 - completely annihilated me and beat me
24:36 - i was like what the hell is happening at
24:38 - that point i had spent six years
24:41 - in practicing and learning chess
24:44 - and at that time he was six years old
24:48 - so he couldn't have spent six years he
24:51 - probably only spent
24:52 - two or three years but was he much
24:55 - smarter than i am
24:57 - or that i was i don't think so i think i
24:59 - was way smarter than him
25:00 - in a lot of things in life like i pretty
25:03 - sure he didn't know about taxes
25:04 - he couldn't do math to save his life he
25:07 - did not understand
25:08 - algebra or calculus like the way that i
25:12 - did
25:14 - you know i was working on differential
25:15 - equations at the time he had no idea
25:17 - about that
25:19 - there were just so many things i was
25:20 - absolutely crushing him in you know
25:23 - um and i just couldn't understand
25:26 - how he beat me so at that point i don't
25:29 - think it was
25:30 - ours at that point it was something else
25:33 - and then something else was he was
25:35 - getting coached by some of the best
25:37 - trainers on the planet and these
25:39 - trainers themselves were like
25:42 - 2600 rated plus you know there were
25:45 - grand masters
25:46 - his dad was coaching him in chess all
25:48 - the time and his dad was a strong player
25:51 - and then his dad had connections to all
25:53 - the best coaches in the world and they
25:54 - would train him
25:56 - and he was getting this incredible
25:59 - training combined with the hours of
26:01 - training
26:01 - so it was leveraged hours
26:07 - leveraged hours and he just got
26:11 - ridiculous results and he beat everybody
26:14 - and now he's on track to be you know
26:18 - maybe even possibly the world's
26:20 - strongest player but now he's a grand
26:21 - master he's a 2600 rated player
26:23 - and when he met me you know when he beat
26:25 - me was like 2100
26:27 - 200 something along those lines
26:31 - so that's the key when you're
26:34 - trying to win hours are going to be a
26:37 - huge leverage
26:38 - and then the other leverage is strategic
26:41 - planning strategic thinking
26:43 - okay that's going to put you way over
26:45 - the top and give you this
26:47 - huge advantage okay that's what happens
26:49 - with all the students that join our
26:50 - coding bootcamp
26:51 - you know for people who are watching
26:53 - from the outside it's like hey how are
26:54 - these students getting these results it
26:56 - doesn't make that much sense how is
26:57 - somebody getting
26:59 - you know a job for 40k 50k 70k 80k
27:03 - in less than seven months
27:07 - in less than eight months we just had
27:09 - our fourth student get
27:10 - a job from our boot camp full stack
27:14 - mastery
27:15 - keep in mind none of the cohorts are
27:16 - finished yet and we have students
27:18 - getting jobs
27:20 - and we just had josh his name is joshua
27:23 - he just landed a job with a company with
27:25 - a crypto company actually which is super
27:27 - interesting
27:28 - so we're providing like the most insane
27:30 - results of any boot camp and we're not
27:32 - funded and we don't have hundreds of
27:34 - millions of dollars behind us
27:36 - we don't have hundreds of hundreds of
27:38 - instructors running the boot camp
27:40 - so how is this happening well it's
27:43 - simple
27:45 - we make sure that a student put in the
27:47 - hours if they don't put in the hours we
27:48 - don't let them in the boot camp we don't
27:49 - let them in the program you can't even
27:51 - be in because you're bound to fail
27:52 - you're bound to be this thirty thousand
27:53 - dollar
27:54 - or twenty thousand dollar person we
27:56 - don't wanna work with you because
27:58 - we don't wanna get you below mediocre
27:59 - results we get you below mediocre
28:01 - results
28:02 - and it makes our program looks bad look
28:04 - bad
28:05 - so we want to be in the category where
28:08 - we're producing these like
28:10 - high achievers like oh wonders that
28:12 - kid's name was a wonder
28:13 - we want to we want to help produce these
28:16 - people here the the
28:17 - freaks of nature and to produce the
28:19 - freaks of natures you have to have
28:21 - people who are already committed and
28:22 - willing to put in ridiculous amount of
28:24 - hours and work
28:25 - and all of that but then you give them
28:28 - strategic planning
28:30 - and then they get what we call leveraged
28:32 - hours and when you get leveraged hours
28:34 - now your hours are not proportional
28:36 - compared to an average person your
28:38 - average your hours have this like weird
28:41 - hockey stick
28:42 - disproportional results that that they
28:44 - provide
28:46 - um and it's in this hockey stick
28:50 - growth where winners are formed and the
28:54 - tick over the market because they're the
28:55 - top
28:56 - 93 percent right so we don't want to
28:59 - produce club players that are eleven
29:01 - hundreds
29:02 - and that's it we want to produce players
29:04 - or like two thousand plus
29:07 - okay 2600 2800
29:11 - that takes years and years of time so
29:13 - it's possible that
29:14 - these students can get to there too so
29:16 - that's why i just say 2000 plus
29:18 - okay because once they're done with us
29:20 - we get them to that like
29:21 - 93 percent best we get them to where
29:25 - they can beat over
29:26 - most of the people their first jobs are
29:29 - going to be around this much and the
29:30 - reason is because
29:32 - they're looking to get experience get
29:33 - their foot in the door but once they
29:35 - have their foot in the door
29:36 - they're well poised to be getting very
29:39 - high paying jobs
29:40 - afterwards and break those six figure
29:42 - marks right a lot of the students at
29:44 - clever programmer have broken that six
29:45 - figure mark
29:47 - a lot a lot of students i mean we had
29:48 - some students that landed a contract for
29:51 - 325
29:52 - 000 python contract uh this guy started
29:56 - working for
29:56 - a big corporation and doing automation
29:59 - for them with python he landed that
30:00 - contract
30:01 - 325 000. think about that 325 000
30:05 - contract one contract right
30:09 - so those are the freaks and we're
30:11 - interested in producing
30:13 - freaks okay that's really our goal
30:17 - um yeah so those were the thoughts on my
30:19 - mind that's kind of the dark side of
30:21 - coding that's the dark side of
30:23 - javascript that's the dark side of the
30:25 - actual truth that not a lot of people
30:27 - talk about they want you to believe in
30:28 -  like
30:30 - you can do this and it's so easy and you
30:32 - can just have this like remote
30:33 - perfect life and is
30:36 - all of those things while they're there
30:38 - there's amount of truth to them and
30:40 - coding is amazing
30:42 - don't get me wrong there's a lot of
30:44 - freedom in it and it's an amazing thing
30:46 - but
30:47 - if they're not telling you how hard it
30:49 - is and how many hours you actually have
30:51 - to put in they're just trying to sell
30:52 - you some and it's bull
30:54 - it's okay so just keep that in
30:56 - mind
30:57 - all right keep that in mind this is very
31:00 - important
31:01 - other than that i hope you enjoyed the
31:02 - video alright and if you want to get
31:04 - these leveraged hours and you want to
31:06 - get
31:07 - incredible results and you want to be

31:18 - full stack mastery
31:19 - we produce the best results for people
31:21 - out there hands down
31:23 - we're not funded and because we're
31:25 - smaller cohorts we can work with you so
31:27 - much more personally

31:31 - so much more hands-on training and
31:32 - guidance
31:34 - it's ridiculous and our instructors will
31:37 - out
31:37 - care any other program we have had it
31:40 - happen
31:41 - countless times where we have students
31:43 - or people who want to change careers
31:45 - that have found other coding bootcamps
31:46 - are going there and they quit
31:48 - those coding bootcamps and they come to
31:49 - ours they drop out of other
31:51 - even joshua was going to another coding
31:53 - boot camp and he stopped it
31:55 - continued hours and got results and he
31:58 - was going to a really famous
31:59 - big coding boot camp i'm not going to
32:01 - name names but he was going to a pretty
32:03 - big coding bootcamp okay so
32:07 - we work with you we get you incredible
32:09 - results we want to make sure that you're
32:11 - a good fit though because we don't want
32:12 - to take in
