01:14 - go ahead and smash that like button down
01:16 - below
01:16 - so that i know that you are actually
01:19 - excited about this comment down below if
01:21 - you like this video
01:22 - and with that said let's roll it
01:26 - [Music]
01:39 - [Applause]
01:42 - so time to get our hands dirty and step
01:44 - number one
01:45 - is obviously creating the project folder
01:48 - that we will be using so
01:50 - i'm just gonna call it tesla home
01:54 - yep and not texas
01:57 - so we got services new terminal at that
02:00 - specific folder
02:02 - and i'm just going to go ahead and type
02:04 - in npx
02:07 - let me actually zoom in a bit so nbx
02:10 - create
02:11 - react app and i'm just going to hit a
02:14 - dot because i want this to be
02:16 - in that specific folder instead of
02:19 - creating a new one and
02:22 - that's pretty much it let it run for a
02:24 - second and i'm just gonna
02:26 - speed it up a bit
02:33 - all right amazing so once you see these
02:36 - two words happy hacking and
02:38 - all these yarn or in your case if you if
02:41 - you use npm
02:42 - then npm start build test eject and all
02:45 - that stuff
02:46 - you are good to go now so i'm just going
02:49 - to open up a new one
02:50 - and i'm just going to just going to say
02:52 - yarn
02:53 - and start so that way i'll fire up
02:56 - um the react server
03:00 - oops something is happening on my local
03:02 - 3000 and here we go
03:04 - okay so this is the template project
03:07 - that you get actually from the guys over
03:09 - at facebook so this is a tablet react
03:11 - project let's actually
03:12 - take a look into it so code space dot
03:15 - will actually open up a vs code in that
03:18 - specific folder for me
03:20 - so that's amazing all right so to change
03:22 - this application we actually need to go
03:24 - into app.js
03:25 - file and start by deleting everything
03:28 - inside of header deleting the logo
03:30 - import because we're not going
03:32 - to use that anymore uh we are now going
03:35 - to use
03:36 - logo svg setup test
03:39 - app has the js all these test files and
03:42 - the logo can go
03:43 - you also have app.css which we will just
03:46 - go ahead and
03:47 - empty out and we also have index.css and
03:50 - we're just going to add
03:51 - a margin of zero so
03:54 - that way everything is going to be
03:56 - perfectly aligned to these sides
03:58 - amazing all right so i'm just going to
04:00 - add the h1
04:01 - over here so that we actually see
04:05 - what's going on so i'm just going to
04:06 - type in cover programmer there we go
04:08 - you can see that on the top over here it
04:10 - says color programmer so that's amazing
04:12 - and with that we are actually done with
04:15 - step number one which is amazing because
04:18 - we can go
04:18 - back into our terminal and type in git
04:22 - add
04:23 - dot and say git commit
04:26 - the sham and clean up so that way we
04:29 - just make a commit
04:31 - that we did these sort of changes
04:34 - and that way it is now committed so
04:36 - that's that it's time for us to start
04:40 - coding
04:42 - all right it is time to actually start
04:44 - coding
04:45 - and let's actually start in app.js so
04:49 - let's take a look at how the official
04:51 - tesla.com page looks like
04:53 - so let's take a look at this so we have
04:55 - a few different things happening over
04:56 - here so we got
04:57 - obviously we got the logo we got this
04:59 - thing in the center
05:00 - and we got these two items over here now
05:03 - we also have a
05:04 - title in the middle and we have some
05:07 - sort of
05:08 - uh uh tag i believe uh happening over
05:12 - here
05:13 - and we also have these two buttons and
05:16 - this
05:17 - little arrow which actually doesn't
05:20 - exist on any of the following pages and
05:22 - notice that the header is is on
05:24 - top and is always on top as i scroll
05:27 - through and we also have this scroll
05:29 - snapping thing
05:30 - something that i will actually leave
05:32 - till the end of this video
05:33 - so you have to actually watch the whole
05:36 - thing right
05:37 - not just forever to it so that's pretty
05:40 - much how it looks like
05:42 - all right let's uh make some sort of
05:44 - sketching out so
05:46 - we obviously have a header on top then
05:48 - we have
05:49 - these items which are snapping and that
05:52 - is pretty much how
05:54 - it should look like now obviously we
05:56 - have a few more of these items
05:59 - and kind of like this is how it looks
06:02 - like at the end
06:03 - before we actually go ahead and get
06:05 - started i have a few
06:07 - different um files that i want to import
06:10 - so
06:11 - say we have the images all these
06:13 - backgrounds we have to use those
06:16 - when we also have some sort of font
06:18 - which is uh
06:20 - which is actually needed to uh complete
06:23 - this
06:23 - project so you can actually download
06:25 - these items uh
06:27 - in the link from the link below there is
06:30 - a google drive link
06:31 - i linked both the fonts and the assets
06:35 - in there so these are actually those
06:37 - files that uh
06:38 - those images that you can actually see
06:41 - on the tesla
06:43 - homepage and that's pretty much it now
06:45 - we obviously have the
06:46 - tesla logo and we have a smaller logo i
06:49 - just created those so
06:50 - we don't have to worry about those
06:52 - anymore now let's create a
06:54 - components folder also inside of here
06:59 - so we got components awesome and then in
07:02 - there
07:02 - we got the header.js
07:06 - and we obviously have a header.css file
07:10 - as well
07:11 - because we will be styling those two now
07:14 - we have we're just going to type in r a
07:17 - f c e that will create a react arrow
07:19 - function
07:20 - component and we and it exports it for
07:23 - us
07:24 - now for class name i want to give it uh
07:26 - obviously header
07:29 - we got a header okay and before we
07:32 - actually forget it let's go ahead and
07:33 - import
07:34 - the css file right now
07:38 - so we got the header.css file from the
07:41 - same folder so that's amazing
07:43 - inside of here we got a few different
07:44 - things so first
07:46 - of course we have we got the logo on the
07:49 - left hand side we got some center pieces
07:51 - and we got the right hand side
07:53 - as well so we're gonna start with the
07:55 - left hand side which is going to be the
07:57 - header logo
08:00 - it's going to be header logo amazing
08:03 - and in there we will have an image tag
08:06 - and that will somehow
08:10 - [Music]
08:11 - we will grab this tesla logo small
08:15 - so let's actually go in and import that
08:17 - right away
08:19 - um we will say tesla logo
08:22 - from and notice that i will need
08:26 - to go up a level of folders and then in
08:29 - there
08:29 - i will have the tesla
08:33 - oh tesla logo
08:37 - small.svg file
08:39 - so that's what i'm gonna be pushing in
08:41 - here
08:43 - and we also have some sort of alt text
08:47 - which is not always necessary but good
08:50 - for
08:50 - seo purposes so we're just gonna say
08:53 - tesla logo
08:54 - in here that's pretty much it
08:57 - okay so we pretty much got a logo let's
09:00 - go ahead and check it out
09:02 - so if i refresh we're not gonna see
09:04 - anything because i haven't imported it
09:06 - so we're gonna go back to
09:07 - in here delete that line and then just
09:10 - add the header
09:11 - right over here boom now i used
09:14 - auto import so when i started typing in
09:17 - header
09:18 - it actually put this line in here if you
09:21 - don't know how to do it
09:22 - not a problem you can just go ahead and
09:24 - copy this line but
09:25 - um actually we as code lets you auto
09:28 - import components
09:30 - okay and we actually got it right there
09:33 - so if we go ahead and yeah look at that
09:37 - that's our tesla logo amazing
09:40 - let's go back and go back to header.js
09:43 - now we got the header center
09:46 - and that's going to be the piece that um
09:52 - that's gonna be that's gonna be the
09:54 - piece that contains all the
09:56 - model and the solar uh parts so i'm just
09:59 - gonna go ahead and put this snippet
10:00 - right in here
10:03 - so we got all these p tags inside of
10:05 - here
10:06 - which are uh containing model s3 xy
10:09 - and solar roof and solar panel
10:13 - uh and that actually created our
10:16 - center part over the header now it
10:19 - doesn't look
10:20 - it's pretty much don't look like a
10:21 - header now not a problem so far
10:23 - we're gonna make it look beautiful all
10:26 - right amazing and
10:27 - we also have a header
10:30 - header right portion
10:34 - which is going to contain the shop
10:38 - and the tesla account
10:43 - which is amazing and we're pretty much
10:46 - are
10:46 - done with the structure of the header
10:49 - now we just gotta make it look beautiful
10:52 - so before we actually
10:54 - go ahead and get started i wanna go into
10:56 - index.css
10:57 - and do a few different things now
11:00 - because notice that
11:02 - tesla's font is not this one now
11:06 - i already provided you with one but
11:09 - it is time we actually start using it so
11:12 - going in here we have a few different
11:16 - things we need to do so
11:17 - obviously we need to
11:21 - say we need to define the font face
11:24 - which is going to be which is going to
11:26 - have a font family
11:28 - of ice iso medium
11:32 - okay and we need to give it a source
11:36 - which is going to be a local one
11:40 - so let's just type that same thing right
11:43 - in there
11:44 - before i make any typing mistakes i'm
11:46 - just going to go ahead and
11:48 - do this and we will also have a url for
11:51 - it
11:52 - and this is actually at the fonts
11:56 - and that's it
11:59 - now we also want to do a format
12:04 - we also want to do a format and say true
12:06 - type in there
12:07 - and we also want to give it a font
12:10 - weight
12:11 - of normal now i forgot to give this here
12:14 - but
12:15 - now we're good and we pretty much
12:18 - just defined a full new
12:21 - um font now that's good let's go into
12:24 - here and
12:25 - where it says font family uh we want to
12:28 - go ahead and add
12:30 - this as the first option so we're just
12:33 - going to say
12:34 - this add a comma and we're good so this
12:37 - is going to be the top priority
12:40 - uh font that we are going to be using
12:42 - throughout the whole page
12:43 - and if you take a look at this it
12:45 - already changed a little
12:46 - so if i go back in here and i remove it
12:50 - uh with you saw that it actually changed
12:54 - a little
12:55 - okay now we got the uh phones figured
12:58 - out
12:59 - let's go back in here and give this
13:02 - header
13:02 - a nice style so inside of header.css we
13:06 - got a few different things that we will
13:08 - need to do
13:09 - so obviously we're going to target the
13:11 - uh header
13:12 - first and we got the display which is
13:15 - going to be not
13:16 - not in line but flex we're going to have
13:18 - a background color
13:20 - of transparent because it is it will
13:23 - always stay on the top and that's how
13:25 - uh that's how it is and we're gonna have
13:28 - a background of
13:29 - none so it is not going to disturb any
13:32 - of the view it's just not going to be
13:35 - there
13:35 - it's good okay and we're going to meet a
13:38 - position
13:39 - of fixed and we're going to have a
13:42 - width of a hundred view width so that
13:44 - will actually stretch out the whole
13:46 - thing
13:46 - throughout the whole page and we're
13:48 - gonna have a top of
13:50 - zero not percent just simply zero
13:53 - good we also will have a margin
13:56 - of 15 pixels
13:59 - and the margin top of fix 15 pixels
14:03 - just to make sure that nothing gets
14:05 - overwritten that's always there
14:07 - and we want to have a z index of 100
14:11 - so it will always stay on the top no
14:13 - matter how we uh
14:16 - how we scroll it so we are
14:20 - kind of getting there we're still pretty
14:22 - far but we're kind of getting there
14:25 - so obviously we want to have a header
14:28 - logo um
14:30 - sort of targeting over here that's good
14:34 - and we're gonna have a height of 24
14:38 - pixels
14:40 - a width of 100 pixels
14:43 - and the margin top of seven pixels
14:46 - so we got the header center over here
14:51 - which will have a flex of one so it will
14:54 - spread out as much as it can
14:56 - without killing the others and this will
14:59 - have a display of flex
15:02 - and the justify content of center
15:05 - now if we take a look at this
15:09 - we are getting closer and closer
15:12 - every single letter we type it is
15:15 - getting closer
15:17 - all right so next up we're going to go
15:19 - into header center and target all those
15:22 - p
15:22 - tags which will have a marg which will
15:25 - have a
15:26 - margin of 10 pixels
15:30 - and we're gonna also say text transform
15:33 - of upper case now we also gonna do
15:36 - a header right
15:40 - that will have our also a display of
15:42 - flex
15:44 - justify content but in this case we are
15:47 - going to
15:48 - uh justify the content to the flex end
15:51 - so that it actually is going to be all
15:53 - the way on the right hand side
15:55 - and we also will do a text transform
15:59 - of uppercase
16:03 - now that's good and we will do the
16:06 - header right
16:07 - and we will target all the p tags in
16:09 - there oops
16:10 - and give them a margin of 10
16:13 - pixels so that's good we are
16:17 - actually there it is looking like
16:21 - it looks amazing so just a quick
16:23 - comparison
16:24 - that's what we got there and
16:27 - it's pretty nice i like it so that is
16:30 - how pretty much the header is
16:32 - uh built up structure wise and for now
16:35 - this is going to be the styling that we
16:37 - will leave
16:38 - it at and let's go ahead and do our git
16:41 - commit so
16:42 - kit and dot let's just take a look at
16:45 - the status
16:46 - because we can do that too so it's
16:48 - amazing here you can
16:50 - see that uh you modify the app.js file
16:54 - added all these files so you should see
16:57 - a lot of new files in here a lot of them
17:00 - in
17:00 - assets and we get the header css and js
17:04 - files and we got the font and we got the
17:08 - index.css
17:09 - as well so that is amazing and now
17:13 - you just want to go ahead and type in
17:14 - git commit dash
17:16 - m and then say uh header
17:20 - plus a set yeah that's good
17:23 - plus it's at plus that's at and if you
17:26 - hit
17:26 - uh return it will do this and now we
17:30 - are actually committed so that's good
17:33 - and on to the next one
17:39 - okay so the main thing in the tesla
17:41 - homepage is
17:42 - actually these uh center pieces
17:45 - i called them items just so it's easier
17:49 - easier to see what's happening let's
17:51 - take a look at what is
17:52 - built up how it is built up
17:56 - so we got obviously this title area
17:59 - ish thing and we have these two buttons
18:03 - but they are kind of like
18:04 - centered and the whole background is
18:07 - filling out the whole screen
18:09 - so that's uh there's a few different
18:10 - things that we will need to
18:12 - address there and there are a few
18:13 - different uh stuff that's happening so
18:17 - over here in accessories we just have
18:19 - one button everywhere else we have two
18:21 - and if we go all the way up we have this
18:23 - uh
18:24 - expand more icon from material ui icons
18:28 - uh so that's just something to keep an
18:31 - eye on too
18:33 - all right so let's understand how it
18:35 - let's actually take
18:36 - a look at this and start building this
18:39 - out
18:40 - so all right so let's start by creating
18:43 - a new component so we will just call it
18:46 - item.js
18:47 - which is amazing and
18:50 - we will just put it on the side and
18:53 - after an rafce we have a
18:55 - full-on function so that's good we give
18:58 - it a class name of
18:59 - item and inside of there we will
19:01 - actually do a few different things
19:03 - so notice that every single one of those
19:06 - have a different background
19:08 - obviously um but we will
19:12 - we kind of want to reuse the same
19:13 - components we will do
19:15 - something called inline styling so we
19:18 - will do inline styling
19:19 - instead of actually um setting this
19:23 - whole thing up
19:24 - to the point where it's like really hard
19:26 - to understand uh how it's happening
19:29 - so what we would do is we would just say
19:31 - style
19:32 - and boom boom two of these squiggly
19:36 - braces and that way we can just start
19:38 - typing css in here
19:40 - so we will just say uh i'm just gonna
19:43 - leave it
19:43 - empty for now because we got a few
19:45 - different things to discuss before
19:47 - we actually install this so that's good
19:50 - that part is amazing and i'm just gonna
19:53 - make
19:53 - a bit more space for myself over here
19:56 - good so we will actually pass in the
19:59 - background over here but
20:00 - let's not worry about that for now uh
20:03 - we will do this in just a second
20:07 - so let's understand what are the stuff
20:09 - that we will actually need to
20:11 - uh have in here so we will have the
20:14 - item container inside of there we will
20:17 - have an item
20:18 - text as well oh
20:22 - item text and that will contain
20:26 - a p tag
20:29 - or it could be like a h1 but i just
20:31 - prefer to go with
20:33 - peas so yes and
20:36 - we will have a class name we will have
20:39 - another
20:40 - div with the item uh text
20:43 - description so that's that there's that
20:46 - too
20:47 - and inside of there we will have another
20:48 - p tag which will contain the description
20:51 - so that's pretty much it uh
20:54 - for the top part because it's not that
20:56 - hard to
20:57 - create and we will have a lower third
21:01 - part of the
21:02 - of the of the specific item so that will
21:05 - contain both the
21:06 - buttons and the arrow where it is
21:08 - actually there
21:10 - so let's just add the item lower
21:13 - third that's good
21:17 - and we will have an item buttons so
21:20 - buttons
21:21 - will be actually a another component
21:24 - which we will build out in just a second
21:27 - but uh we kind of see that these are
21:30 - props that we would need to
21:31 - pop in here obviously um
21:35 - because there are different texts on
21:37 - these um
21:40 - on these buttons so we have order now
21:42 - learn more and shop now and all these
21:44 - kind of stuff
21:45 - and we got custom order so we really
21:48 - need to keep an eye on what
21:50 - what we are actually rendering out on
21:52 - screen
21:53 - so with that i actually have a few
21:55 - different snippets
21:57 - which you which is highly recommended
22:00 - for you to just go ahead and copy i will
22:03 - make it easy for you
22:05 - um by showing all this stuff this is
22:09 - actually going through the whole assets
22:11 - folder
22:12 - and then just imports everything in here
22:14 - so that's that's that
22:16 - and then in here
22:19 - let's delete all these commented parts
22:23 - we will have the app items
22:27 - container boom we want items container
22:31 - and that will actually contain all the
22:34 - items that we got here
22:35 - so let's do let's go ahead and i have
22:38 - another
22:39 - snippet just like that on the snippet
22:41 - you can actually see that i'm already
22:43 - passing in
22:44 - all these stuff we got description links
22:47 - so if you want to go ahead and add that
22:49 - uh feature on top of it you can totally
22:51 - go ahead and do it
22:53 - uh we are not going to worry about that
22:55 - too much because it's like uh very html
22:58 - basic so
22:59 - i'll just actually
23:03 - okay so we we got the uh we got the
23:04 - possibility to extend everything
23:07 - and if this video actually gets the
23:10 - 5 000 likes that i was talking about at
23:13 - the beginning of this video
23:15 - um we will actually fill all these stuff
23:18 - up and we will have a fully
23:23 - we will have a fully ready tesla.com
23:26 - page
23:27 - so for that i have all these expansion
23:30 - ready stuff here
23:31 - so if you haven't already smash that
23:34 - like button because
23:36 - that is the number one most important
23:38 - ways to become
23:40 - a developer in 2021 so make sure to
23:43 - smash it and make sure to smash it
23:45 - and uneven so it's so an odd number of
23:48 - times because
23:50 - if you smash it two four six eight you
23:53 - actually happen to
23:54 - unsmash it by the last time you smash it
23:58 - and that is just not good so you wanna
24:00 - go with the one three
24:01 - five seven nine route where you actually
24:05 - happen to smash it at the very end
24:07 - all right so that's something to keep in
24:09 - mind all right let's go let's continue
24:12 - so we got the item the js now obviously
24:15 - we only
24:15 - we need to uh actually grab
24:18 - all these stuff so we can go ahead and
24:22 - destructure it right away
24:23 - you can actually type it out so we got
24:25 - all these stuff happening
24:27 - basically you want to type out here
24:29 - everything that we
24:30 - uh passed in so we will do a few
24:33 - different things now
24:34 - um so just so we have the uh things that
24:38 - we need to have
24:39 - so we obviously uh change it to the
24:42 - proper uh prop so we will have the
24:45 - description here and we will have the
24:47 - title
24:47 - it's good and then
24:51 - this is where it gets tricky so let's go
24:53 - ahead
24:54 - and we're not going to focus on the
24:57 - button
24:58 - just yet we want to get the item
25:01 - ready but uh we wouldn't
25:04 - this is the time when we actually need
25:06 - to go ahead and create the button
25:08 - uh the button item
25:11 - so we will have it here and we're just
25:13 - going to type in rafce so that's good
25:16 - we will have a class name of button
25:20 - and we will leave it just like that uh
25:22 - we're not going to
25:23 - um we're not going to worry about that
25:26 - too much right
25:27 - so we will have so we are done there
25:32 - and we're just going to go ahead and
25:33 - import it so again i use auto import but
25:36 - you can
25:36 - go ahead and import it this way and to
25:40 - the
25:40 - item so to the button i have
25:44 - an importancy which i will pass in so
25:47 - the first one is obviously going to be
25:48 - the primary button
25:50 - then it will have a text which is going
25:53 - to be
25:53 - the left button text because the left
25:55 - button is going to be the primary one
25:58 - because uh because yeah
26:02 - and we also want to pass in the uh link
26:06 - which is going to be the left button
26:08 - link now
26:10 - again i left space for
26:13 - us to actually improve on this and add
26:16 - more features
26:17 - on top of this um
26:20 - so just yet we are not going to use the
26:23 - button links and all that stuff but
26:25 - if this video gets those 5k likes we
26:28 - will
26:29 - all right so now i'm going to teach you
26:31 - a neat little trick which
26:33 - i don't think we actually have uh done
26:35 - on this channel
26:37 - okay so two buttons two of these and
26:39 - signs and then
26:41 - this is where the second button is going
26:43 - to
26:45 - come if it is needed it's going to be a
26:48 - secondary button
26:49 - now this will have a text of the right
26:52 - button
26:52 - text and a link of the right button link
27:00 - so that's that now let's actually take a
27:02 - moment and understand what is happening
27:04 - here
27:04 - so we got the two buttons which we
27:06 - actually pass in
27:08 - over here so if it is true right
27:12 - uh then this statement is going to be
27:14 - true now
27:15 - this operator is actually checking if
27:18 - both sides are true
27:20 - now if the left side is not true then
27:22 - it's not even going to check the second
27:24 - the right hand side so we can actually
27:28 - leave it here so in case the two buttons
27:31 - is false it is not even going to take a
27:33 - look at what's happening here because
27:35 - then the whole
27:37 - uh operation is going to be false so we
27:40 - it will just ignore this line of code so
27:42 - if
27:43 - two buttons is false then it will ignore
27:46 - line 21.
27:47 - now on the other hand if the two buttons
27:51 - is true
27:52 - it will check the second part if it is
27:55 - true now
27:55 - it will check it in a way that it
27:57 - actually executes it
27:59 - and then we will have it rendered out so
28:01 - that's pretty much how it works super
28:03 - easy super elegant
28:05 - and super great way to uh work with
28:09 - so we will go down a row deeper
28:12 - outside of this div and then we will do
28:15 - the exact same thing
28:17 - thing so if this is the first one then
28:20 - we will going to go ahead
28:22 - and render out a something so it will be
28:25 - an item
28:27 - expand which we will uh
28:31 - and this is the time when we will be
28:33 - using material ui now let's take a look
28:35 - at what
28:36 - we're going to be looking at so we're
28:38 - going to need to have a material ui
28:40 - icon all right so we're going to be
28:44 - going to material icons good and then we
28:48 - will have this expand
28:49 - more so this not this so this one
28:53 - is what we're going to be using you can
28:55 - just go ahead and hit the copy
28:57 - and go back here and then in here we
29:00 - will just say yarn
29:01 - um yarn add
29:04 - and add material dash ui
29:08 - core so first we need to add the core
29:11 - and then
29:12 - we can add the icons as well so i'm just
29:14 - going to
29:15 - uh speed it up for you
29:18 - all right we're back and we're going to
29:20 - say we're going to do the same
29:22 - ins but we're going to change it to
29:24 - icons
29:26 - and that way we will be able to work
29:28 - with it all right let's speed it up
29:31 - good we are back and up here
29:35 - we can just go ahead and hit a paste and
29:38 - once we are
29:38 - done with that we can just say expand
29:41 - more icon
29:43 - and that's it and actually let's not
29:45 - forget to import
29:46 - item from
29:50 - uh we're gonna go to components and
29:52 - we're gonna say item
29:54 - so that's pretty much how it should be
29:55 - looking like and let's go ahead and hit
29:58 - it or hit a refresh
30:00 - and boom we got all these stuff
30:02 - happening here that's
30:03 - pretty good and now um remember i said
30:09 - uh we will have this uh inline styling
30:11 - in here so we're just gonna say
30:13 - background image
30:16 - and we're gonna give it a url
30:22 - and that and in there we will pass in
30:25 - the background image
30:33 - so that's good and it should actually
30:36 - load up all our images so
30:38 - that's actually pretty amazing i think
30:40 - it looks good
30:41 - for most back-end developers this
30:43 - actually looks uh pretty acceptable
30:45 - and ready to be shipped but
30:48 - hold on to that uh we will start we will
30:52 - actually make it look pretty nice
30:54 - so let's just uh add a new file in here
30:57 - item css good all right so the item has
31:01 - a
31:01 - few different things inside in terms of
31:03 - styling so what we will do is we will
31:05 - give it a height of a hundred view
31:07 - heights so that will
31:08 - stretch out vertically and then we want
31:11 - to say
31:12 - width of a hundred view width
31:15 - which will stretch out horizontally
31:19 - and then we will give it a background
31:21 - position
31:23 - so we will give it a background position
31:26 - of
31:27 - center and then a background repeat of
31:31 - no repeat so that way it will not go
31:33 - ahead and repeat
31:34 - the background all the way
31:37 - and then we will have a background cover
31:40 - no
31:42 - we have a background side and we will
31:44 - have a background size of
31:46 - cover instead of contain and
31:49 - a display flex and
31:52 - we will justify everything to the center
31:55 - so that's pretty much how we will
31:58 - start this off with we have a testing
32:02 - library we don't need that so thank you
32:03 - for
32:04 - joining our session but we will import
32:08 - the item.css file
32:11 - that's pretty good and then let's take a
32:13 - look at if it takes action
32:15 - boom there we go we got all the text up
32:18 - top so that's amazing
32:19 - we have everything in the center and we
32:22 - also have the
32:23 - um header on top of everything and
32:26 - staying right there so that's cool
32:28 - so it kind of works all right uh let's
32:31 - go a bit down
32:32 - and we're gonna have the item container
32:36 - which will have a width which will have
32:39 - a width of 40
32:40 - you with a display
32:44 - of flex we will give it a flux direction
32:47 - of column and an align items of
32:50 - center so that way we will snap
32:53 - everything
32:54 - in the middle so that's pretty good all
32:56 - right
32:58 - all right up next we got the item text
33:01 - which we will target
33:02 - and make look beautiful which
33:05 - has a margin top of 20
33:09 - and we'll have a display flex just like
33:12 - everything else
33:13 - and it will have a flex direction of
33:16 - column and a font size
33:20 - of 34 pixels
33:24 - now we will also give it a nice color
33:27 - which is actually the tesla font color
33:31 - so that's good uh so this is 39
33:35 - 39 3c and 41 i'll just throw it on the
33:39 - screen
33:40 - so it's easier to copy and we will have
33:42 - an align items
33:44 - of center and the flex
33:47 - of one
33:50 - so that's pretty much for the text let's
33:52 - take a look at what's happening over
33:54 - here so it's pretty pretty looking
33:56 - pretty nice already
33:57 - we also got the item text description
34:02 - which will have a fun way of who which
34:06 - we have a font weight of
34:09 - 200 and the font size of
34:12 - 14 pixels
34:15 - next up we got the item lower third uh
34:18 - with a margin bottom of five pixels
34:20 - display flex
34:21 - flex the deduction of column and we will
34:24 - also use the display flex on the item
34:27 - buttons because we want them to be like
34:29 - next to each other so that's pretty nice
34:32 - and then item expand
34:37 - which will have a color of white
34:40 - and a width of 100
34:47 - margin top margin top of three percent
34:52 - and the justify content of center
34:55 - now this is how uh this is the look that
34:58 - we just got
34:59 - so we're getting there we're getting
35:01 - there we're
35:02 - pretty much cool with the i'm pretty
35:04 - much cool with how the
35:05 - items are looking right like right now
35:09 - we have a few different things to uh
35:11 - left to do but
35:12 - let's actually do a git commit
35:15 - so we will say get a dot get
35:18 - commit dash m and we will say
35:22 - item that's pretty much it for the item
35:26 - i'll see you in the next one
35:31 - all right before we actually finish this
35:33 - project up
35:34 - one more thing we have uh we have to do
35:37 - is uh
35:38 - button so the button is actually a
35:42 - uh since in button it's actually
35:45 - not that crazy but at first it may look
35:48 - like
35:48 - so in here we got this uh button uh
35:51 - class name which is good but we're just
35:53 - gonna get rid of it because
35:55 - we will have template literals coming in
35:57 - here
35:58 - so remember we actually passed in the
36:01 - importancy
36:02 - of the specific button as well as the
36:04 - text and the link
36:07 - and based on what kind of button it is
36:11 - we will display different kind of things
36:13 - and it will look different
36:16 - so what we will do is we have the
36:18 - template literals here
36:19 - so we can type in button and
36:24 - we're going to say if the importancy
36:27 - equals uh secondary
36:32 - then we want to add a button
36:36 - that uh let's go underscore white
36:40 - otherwise we're not we don't want to add
36:42 - anything at all
36:43 - so that's good now inside of here we
36:46 - will have an a
36:47 - which uh which will have a an href
36:50 - and that will be the link and we will
36:53 - have the
36:54 - text that's pretty much it that's the
36:56 - structure of the button
36:58 - so that's good so
37:01 - this here again this is an es6 way so
37:04 - it's a super modern way
37:06 - to actually do uh an if statement i
37:09 - highly highly recommend everybody goes
37:10 - ahead and learns it
37:12 - so that's uh that's just what happens
37:14 - here all right
37:16 - now actually let's go ahead
37:19 - and make this button look nice so we
37:22 - will
37:23 - uh type here uh button.css and before we
37:26 - actually go in and get
37:28 - and forget it let's uh add the button
37:31 - let's import it so that's good
37:34 - and in here actually the css this time
37:37 - is going to be
37:37 - way more than the javascript than the
37:40 - jsx
37:41 - it will have a background color of rgba
37:45 - and it will have a 23
37:49 - uh 26 32
37:52 - and a point eight opacity
37:56 - so that's good and we will have a height
37:58 - of 40 pixels
38:00 - and a width of 256.
38:05 - yes 256 pixels
38:08 - we also have a margin of 8 pixels
38:12 - display of flex because we want them to
38:15 - be next to each other
38:20 - and we would justify all the content to
38:22 - the center
38:24 - and align them to the center so both
38:26 - horizontally
38:27 - and vertically they are going to be on
38:29 - the center and we will
38:30 - border radius of a hundred pixels
38:34 - and we will have the opacity of the
38:37 - whole thing
38:39 - not just the uh not just the background
38:42 - because the background
38:43 - is 0.8 but uh even
38:47 - we need to reduce the text opacity to
38:50 - 0.85
38:52 - now inside of there we will have we have
38:55 - obviously the link
38:57 - and we need to remove all the text
39:00 - decoration
39:02 - which is going to be none after this
39:05 - a color of white is going to be given to
39:07 - it
39:08 - we will have a font size of 12 pixels
39:12 - and a text align
39:15 - text align of center now
39:19 - remember if it is a secondary one we
39:22 - will add a button y
39:23 - so that's what we will define over here
39:26 - so if it is going to be
39:27 - if it ends up to be a white button
39:32 - then obviously we want it to look look
39:34 - white so we will say
39:36 - background color so we will say
39:38 - background color
39:39 - is going to be white in that case and we
39:42 - want the opacity or to be
39:44 - 0.65 so it's
39:47 - less hard so white is a much harsh much
39:49 - more harsh color than black
39:51 - uh see we want that to be uh
39:55 - reduced more and inside of there
39:58 - we will have we will give the text color
40:01 - uh to be black
40:06 - taking a look at what we have it is
40:08 - pretty much
40:09 - done only thing left to do for
40:12 - us is going to be the scroll snap so
40:14 - let's roll that
40:18 - we have everything ready to go we have
40:21 - all the styling
40:22 - one thing and this is a new stuff that
40:25 - we haven't
40:26 - done on this channel just yet up until
40:29 - now
40:30 - but it's time we actually introduce
40:32 - scroll snapping
40:34 - so what we would do is open
40:37 - and we will have a few different things
40:40 - coming in here
40:41 - so we will have app item
40:45 - with our app items container
40:48 - and that we have a scroll snap
40:52 - type of mandatory and it will be only
40:57 - mandatory for the y-axis
40:59 - now we will also have an overflow which
41:02 - is going to be auto
41:04 - and a height of a hundred view height
41:08 - now one more thing which we need to do
41:11 - because it's
41:12 - it just only enforces it but
41:16 - it doesn't know what it needs to enforce
41:18 - it on
41:19 - so what we will do is going to item.css
41:24 - and we will add one more thing here
41:26 - which is going to be
41:27 - scroll snap align and we want the start
41:31 - to be aligned to it and
41:34 - that will actually bring us the desired
41:36 - outcome of snapping
41:37 - the scrolling and now you cannot
41:40 - actually stop it in between
41:42 - it will snap it somewhere so that's that
41:45 - amazing job you build the tesla home
41:47 - page smash that like button
41:49 - once again if you want that want me to
41:52 - actually go ahead and build it further
41:54 - alright that was it for today's video
41:55 - let me know in in the comments down
41:57 - below if you liked it or
41:58 - what else do you want me to build for
42:01 - you and also smash that like button if
42:03 - we reach
42:04 - 5 000 likes on this video i will be
42:06 - dropping the next episode
