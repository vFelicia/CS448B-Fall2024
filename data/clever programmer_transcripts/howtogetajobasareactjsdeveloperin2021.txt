02:43 - through it i'm realizing
02:44 - a lot of like what types of stuff am i
02:47 - ignoring
02:47 - what type of stuff am i not really
02:50 - looking at and what type of people am i
02:52 - declining versus the people who i am
02:57 - okay cool what type of people i'm giving
02:59 - a chance to
03:01 - so whoever is on this call by the way
03:02 - guys just mute yourselves if you have
03:04 - some sounds going on in the background
03:06 - so anton was somebody who stood out when
03:09 - he actually applied
03:11 - to my job posting there were a bunch of
03:13 - people that did not stand out and i
03:15 - rejected them
03:16 - and one of the things i want to share
03:17 - why he stood out was of his project
03:20 - everybody's going to talk a big game
03:21 - they're all going to say i have a lot of
03:23 - experience with react
03:24 - redux and they're going to say these hot
03:26 - keywords right
03:28 - because these are like the hot
03:29 - technologies right now have you guys
03:30 - heard of
03:31 - redux and things like that with the
03:33 - react
03:34 - yeah yeah so this is one of those things
03:38 - that a lot of people will talk about but
03:40 - i want to see what your projects look
03:42 - like so here when i went to take a look
03:44 - at this project
03:46 - this is a solid project on a portfolio
03:49 - it's very clean
03:50 - it's fast and it's simple would you guys
03:53 - agree that this looks pretty good
03:58 - so this made him stand out for me
04:02 - another types of projects like um i saw
04:04 - that really stood out and blew me away i
04:06 - was like wow this is a person i want to
04:08 - interview
04:09 - and get on a call with was
04:12 - uh were the type of people where they
04:14 - had um
04:16 - they would have um you can log in
04:20 - so like the design here is what do you
04:23 - guys think
04:24 - this design is pretty cool right
04:28 - and what's cool is that there's a demo
04:30 - login
04:32 - so most times i go into these apps
04:35 - and if you want to have an app guys
04:38 - please don't
04:39 - have recruiters log in with the right
04:41 - credentials
04:43 - so many times your apps will not get
04:45 - used simply because you have
04:46 - authentication that the recruiter who's
04:48 - trying to check your
04:49 - projects doesn't have access to okay
04:52 - so it makes a ton of sense to have a
04:54 - demo login
04:56 - over here on the left maybe also go
04:59 - ahead
05:00 - it will be also called just like privacy
05:02 - issues to recruit us
05:04 - on this website or something that's
05:07 - right
05:08 - that's right i think that as well i'm
05:09 - like um you know i don't know this
05:11 - person
05:12 - i don't think i'm gonna put in my
05:13 - password right
05:15 - so on the left hand side you can see
05:18 - this
05:19 - they have a pretty slick ui ux
05:21 - experience here
05:23 - and already visually i can tell that
05:25 - this developer really knows how
05:26 - components are working
05:28 - so because i can see here on this left
05:30 - hand side i can see all of this stuff
05:32 - here where the leaks are
05:34 - and then this is being rendered on the
05:36 - fly without me having to refresh when i
05:37 - click
05:38 - this it's a pretty slick ui
05:41 - when i go and i try to create something
05:44 - enter the name of your league let's
05:46 - profit with javascript gang
05:49 - let's put a hopefully it doesn't break
05:53 - um and guys please don't spam their
05:55 - thing because they're not
05:57 - expecting any traffic right so like if
06:00 - you're watching this
06:02 - don't spam it please all right
06:05 - so we created a league and i think it's
06:08 - going to get populated over here on the
06:10 - left hand side
06:11 - it takes a little bit of time to
06:13 - populate
06:15 - but it does end up doing it ultimately
06:19 - that's what i realized so that was one
06:20 - thing that i was like that's a little
06:22 - bit slow
06:23 - what what what is the back end is it
06:26 - uh uh his back end i don't know
06:31 - this person's back end i i don't know i
06:33 - would have to once i'm in an interview
06:35 - i'll ask him
06:36 - when i'm when i'm but this person did
06:38 - get a chance to get an interview from us
06:40 - so when i'm speaking with him um he'll
06:44 - probably go into detail behind his code
06:46 - and
06:46 - um how he went through it by the way do
06:49 - any of you guys
06:50 - want to you know right now you guys are
06:53 - on this call
06:54 - do you guys want me to go through your
06:56 - portfolio or your projects
06:58 - do any of you guys want me to do that
06:59 - yeah yeah yeah
07:02 - yes no um
07:08 - okay but you can go through it yeah
07:18 - uh did you drop it as a link yeah yeah
07:20 - in the chat box
07:22 - okay so let's take a look at it
07:26 - oh it was it's fast it's really fast
07:30 - yeah basically yeah
07:37 - uh
07:42 - again
07:56 - wow that's it it's really really i mean
08:00 - i
08:00 - love the speed of this and it's it flies
08:03 - and you need to
08:04 - just type in test just type in test
08:08 - heroku.com oh
08:20 - so if i saw this my real i'm gonna be is
08:24 - it okay if i'm just gonna be really
08:25 - honest with you guys here
08:26 - on this call if i saw this i would
08:29 - actually give you
08:29 - i would actually reach out for an
08:31 - interview
08:34 - most a lot of developers don't have this
08:36 - stuff
08:37 - on there they have broken links or like
08:40 - really really baby projects
08:41 - that i just ignore when i see like
08:44 - really small projects it's like the
08:45 - simplest to-do list app or something
08:47 - that i feel like they just picked up
08:48 - from a tutorial
08:49 - but this has multiple pages that i can
08:52 - go through
08:53 - it has rod register login none of the
08:55 - functionality seems broken
08:58 - and um even when i go to each thing like
09:00 - how you were saying it was pulling uh
09:02 - git repos for you know sven when i went
09:04 - and it was pulling it and it looks like
09:06 - it's actually working
09:07 - so that's a really good sign to me so
09:10 - this would actually get you a
09:11 - um interview i really think so but this
09:15 - is not here i'm still working on
09:16 - my my portfolio yeah another group
09:20 - well
09:33 - yeah that's my feedback for you so sorry
09:36 - thank you so much
09:37 - really good job another app that this
09:40 - person had on their portfolio really
09:42 - like
09:42 - blew my mind and i was really excited
09:44 - about this so
09:45 - i went here it's no nosy robin hood so
09:47 - i'm like okay let's see how
09:48 - it works right now there's demo and i
09:51 - was already excited i'm like oh
09:54 - demo version because as a recruiter i
09:56 - hate signing up to all of these just to
09:57 - test them and i just ignore it
09:59 - so your app will not get used by a
10:01 - recruiter if you don't have a demo login
10:03 - so always have a demo login
10:06 - then i click the demo login and let me
10:08 - in look at that
10:10 - that's a pretty sick front end right
10:13 - that's pretty damn good
10:15 - it is
10:19 - cool let me do that let's do that all
10:21 - right and
10:22 - as i was going through it if they're
10:24 - using a charting library
10:26 - that seems pretty on point um i would
10:29 - okay so let's see what happens
10:31 - if i try to let's see if i need to
10:35 - move this here so let's see what happens
10:37 - if i try to change the
10:40 - wow it's responsive too
10:44 - right really responsive so that's a
10:46 - really good sign when i see that
10:48 - it's responsive and can i buy
10:51 - new shares uh okay so let's type in
10:56 - tesla and type in that
11:01 - okay so freaks out over tesla
11:05 - let's see does it freak out
11:08 - so that's not a good sign but honestly
11:11 - uh
11:11 - if somebody has a dummy project and it's
11:14 - that deep
11:15 - that's good enough like i'm not going to
11:17 - be nitpicking this and making sure
11:18 - every single thing in here is perfect as
11:20 - long as i see this i can see they have
11:23 - good front-end skills i see they have
11:25 - you know especially for a react.js
11:27 - developer i'm really looking for
11:28 - front-end skills
11:30 - one of the things guys that's one of the
11:32 - biggest turn-offs
11:33 - is poor front-end skills especially if
11:36 - you're trying to apply for react.js
11:38 - developer
11:38 - job your main thing is to provide
11:42 - a good ui user experience
11:45 - so when your front-end skills are not
11:46 - good and i go to your portfolio page
11:48 - and it looks wack that already kind of
11:51 - doesn't end up giving you a chance does
11:53 - that make sense
12:08 - i would worry less about a perfect cheat
12:11 - sheet i would worry about
12:12 - more like hey can i make an app that's
12:14 - like that looks very close to this thing
12:18 - i mean you know can you start off with
12:21 - just using html and css to design
12:23 - something that looks like this that
12:24 - would be a great start
12:26 - and then going next level and because
12:30 - it's not just you need more technologies
12:32 - to be able to build this right it's not
12:33 - like now
12:34 - redux can really make this happen or
12:37 - there is new context api that's making
12:39 - this happen this is just
12:41 - design skills so in order to improve
12:43 - your design skills
12:45 - one of the platforms i recently found
12:47 - which i you know this is not a promotion
12:49 - or anything i
12:50 - just found them two or three days ago i
12:52 - just signed up myself for them
12:54 - i think their design is absolutely
12:57 - incredible
12:58 - on this platform and so if you want to
13:00 - improve your design skills you can sign
13:02 - up for something like this or go to a
13:04 - free resource i don't care like there's
13:05 - dev ed there's plenty of free resources
13:07 - so if you don't feel like paying you
13:08 - don't have to
13:09 - just go and find something online but
13:11 - their design skills are like
13:13 - i've never seen better design skills in
13:14 - my life
13:16 - so that another resource
13:19 - that's good for inspiration is this
13:23 - because if you want to wow the recruiter
13:26 - you have to understand that most times
13:27 - recruiters are not the best developers
13:29 - themselves
13:30 - so before you can wow them with your
13:34 - code wow them with your actual project
13:37 - who here has a github do you guys want
13:40 - to drop your
13:41 - drop your links to your github profiles
13:44 - right now and show you zoom chat i'm
13:45 - going to take a look at it
13:47 - so uh github is another really good
13:50 - resource
13:58 - all right so let's take a look all right
14:00 - so tarva dropped his
14:02 - i'm gonna uh i'm gonna give you real
14:05 - feedback okay whoever's dropping i'm
14:06 - just gonna give you real feedback on it
14:08 - so here i'm gonna go instantly when i
14:12 - look at this
14:12 - i'm like okay he's modeling when i see
14:14 - clones i'm like okay he's
14:16 - getting this from some tutorials okay so
14:19 - even though
14:20 - these are our tutorials on youtube that
14:23 - i have had a lot of people actually
14:25 - apply to our jobs
14:27 - using the tutorials that they've built
14:29 - from our platforms
14:32 - it's funny but uh there's nothing crazy
14:34 - wrong with that
14:35 - but one thing i do know is you
14:39 - you've showed me that you can uh follow
14:41 - a step-by-step guide somewhere and build
14:43 - something
14:44 - still doesn't show me what you are doing
14:46 - so right now when i see this
14:48 - i'm like i'm not sure what he's up to
14:51 - right and then i go to your githubs and
14:52 - i'm like
14:53 - that's a 109 contributions this year
14:59 - you have to mute yourself brother when
15:01 - um
15:03 - all good all good thank you so
15:07 - oh yeah because you have two two uh
15:09 - things you're using got it
15:10 - so here are 51 contributions i see i
15:13 - look at 2020 i'm like
15:14 - only 109 contributions this entire year
15:18 - that's not that good can i make somebody
15:20 - co-host here if you can help me
15:21 - manage the sounds
15:29 - all right i made you co-host as well joe
15:32 - okay just um any anytime there's a sound
15:35 - maybe sometimes people forget to turn it
15:37 - off
15:39 - okay cool so that's great so
15:42 - here yeah when i see 20 contra when i
15:44 - see
15:45 - 109 contributions that's good 51
15:48 - 0 0 so i imagine you really started in
15:51 - like 2019
15:53 - um and then really in 2020 i want to see
15:56 - more contributions i this is not enough
15:59 - contributions okay
16:00 - so like for example even if you take a
16:02 - look at mine right it's been a while
16:04 - since um
16:06 - i've been coding a lot less now compared
16:08 - to how much i used to code
16:10 - like right now i'm running a company as
16:12 - ceo i'm not sitting there writing code i
16:14 - hire react developers right i'm not
16:16 - actually doing
16:17 - that much coding but i have 91
16:20 - contributions
16:22 - if i go to 2019 or 2018
16:25 - right uh wait this is my profile what's
16:27 - going on there we go
16:28 - so 2016 you can see i was super active
16:31 - right
16:32 - so it doesn't need to be this crazy but
16:34 - it should be somewhere
16:36 - here where when i look at your ear i can
16:38 - see oh this person is coding a lot
16:40 - they're learning a lot
16:41 - whatever it may be so it's a good sign
16:43 - not the only sign but
16:45 - if i see your portfolio and it doesn't
16:46 - look that good i'm gonna give you
16:48 - another chance by looking at your github
16:50 - so if your github or your portfolio
16:53 - both let me down then i'm just going to
16:55 - move on that makes sense at tarva
17:00 - okay oh there's also i have a question
17:02 - if you just
17:13 - so hold on so tell me again what your
17:15 - question is
17:16 - so if i go to your home page of github
17:18 - or what
17:20 - yes so here right here if you just see i
17:22 - have my hand less contributions
17:24 - so as a recruiter i
17:32 - might if i see something kind of
17:34 - interesting that catches my
17:36 - eye um you know if you have some type of
17:39 - like right now i don't know why but
17:41 - i just don't feel like clicking on any
17:43 - of these because they're php this is
17:44 - android so like
17:46 - i'm just kind of avoiding them right now
17:48 - but if you have projects i might click
17:50 - on them and look inside
17:52 - i'm looking for you know can you also
17:55 - code on your own not just follow
17:57 - tutorials
17:57 - really important and what are your
18:00 - skills and how do you
18:02 - do it so what i'm going to do is when i
18:04 - go to
18:05 - you know say i go to your portfolio i'm
18:07 - going to actually even
18:08 - click on your commits and see how you're
18:10 - committing
18:12 - and i'm going to see how many commits
18:14 - you have done and i'm going to see what
18:15 - you've done in those commits
18:17 - so here's your initial commit
18:20 - right this is what you did in your
18:22 - initial commit and then whatever you did
18:24 - in your next commit
18:25 - but generally i don't want to spend that
18:27 - much time just because we have so many
18:29 - job applications so unless there's
18:30 - something
18:31 - really good signs i'm seeing already i'm
18:32 - going to not go that deep into it
18:36 - so when you okay one thing i recommend
18:38 - is if you don't have job experience
18:41 - which almost every single person that's
18:44 - applying to our thing doesn't have job
18:45 - experience as
18:46 - very limited job experience you need to
18:49 - have
18:50 - really solid project experience if you
18:53 - have
18:53 - really solid you know you're doing tons
18:56 - of projects
18:57 - you will get a shot if you can prove
18:59 - that you're coding and you're
19:01 - hungry
19:02 - not just through your words but your
19:03 - actions because github doesn't lie
19:05 - you will get a shot but you know if it's
19:08 - only tutorial
19:10 - based stuff that you've then you won't
19:11 - really get a shot they'll move on
19:17 - make sense okay so i would definitely
19:18 - like to see some more of your projects
19:21 - even if they're not that great right i
19:22 - want to see some of your additions in
19:24 - here
19:25 - um who else shared their
19:29 - so let's see here we got
19:35 - is it george or jorge cisco
19:42 - okay jorge you got it all right so good
19:45 - photo so
19:46 - taro another thing put a photo i have
19:48 - this funny saying
19:50 - no photo no employment um
19:53 - put a photo like it's so freaking
19:56 - helpful you have no idea uh even
19:59 - i'm doing a little bit of recruiting
20:01 - right now and me
20:03 - and daniel were going through it and we
20:04 - ended up developing such a strong bias
20:07 - towards like uh somebody having a photo
20:09 - versus not
20:10 - it's not the only thing but you have to
20:13 - understand okay
20:14 - we're gonna be working with this person
20:15 - for a really long time
20:17 - right so it it actually helps to see
20:19 - your face or to see you smiling or
20:21 - something
20:22 - you're like oh okay cool so the culture
20:25 - fit is actually more important than even
20:27 - the technical competence so i don't know
20:28 - if you guys know this but like
20:30 - they did a study of uh 20 000 hires
20:34 - and they mentioned it in this book
20:35 - called the hiring for attitude okay
20:37 - that's what the book hiring for attitude
20:40 - and uh
20:40 - in this study what they found is only 11
20:44 - of the and they did a study of over 18
20:47 - months of each new hire
20:49 - and what they found is only 11
20:53 - actually failed uh because of
20:56 - technical competence
21:00 - okay 89
21:05 - of the people and when i say fail what
21:06 - that means either resigned or were
21:07 - terminated
21:10 - 89 of the people failed because of
21:13 - soft skills okay
21:17 - so what does that mean this is broken
21:20 - down how they broken down into is like
21:22 - coachability um temperament of that
21:25 - person
21:27 - in other words how i like to put it in
21:29 - really simple terms is vibe
21:31 - check did they pass the vibe check or
21:32 - not okay
21:34 - so what's that person's vibe what's
21:36 - their personality like do you see
21:38 - yourself
21:38 - wanting to work with them over a long
21:40 - period of time or do you feel like
21:41 - they're going to be a
21:42 - really good technically skilled
21:44 - you don't want that right you guys don't
21:46 - want to work with somebody who's like
21:48 - intellectually superior and like tries
21:50 - to make everybody
21:51 - else feel down so that's the last type
21:53 - of person people want to work with
21:55 - so that's what they found was leading to
21:57 - this
21:58 - most companies a lot of their
22:00 - interviewing process is actually mostly
22:02 - culture fit and then they go into the
22:06 - interviewing process of technical skills
22:09 - if you hear nasa's story some of his
22:11 - interviews didn't even have any
22:12 - technical portion to it
22:15 - right so uh very important a lot of the
22:18 - people that work on our team at clever
22:19 - programmer
22:21 - nobody ever really had to go through a
22:23 - technical assessment
22:24 - it was mostly like what's the culture
22:26 - fit what's the level of the culture fit
22:28 - because people can still train you
22:29 - so good photo finance developer capable
22:32 - of
22:33 - or freelance developer i'm sorry okay
22:36 - cool
22:36 - using proper communication with clients
22:39 - got it
22:40 - and uh so i i think i need to
22:43 - i need to change that because i i i kind
22:46 - of used
22:47 - that yeah i was thinking i'm like this
22:50 - looks like
22:51 - i was laughing i was thinking about that
22:52 - right now
22:56 - hey what's up bro just mute yourself for
22:58 - now please
23:00 - awesome happy new year
23:04 - oh happy new years yeah that's actually
23:06 - awesome in sri lanka
23:08 - too so amanda uh it's happy new year's
23:10 - for him that's amazing
23:11 - guys isn't this exciting that we're
23:13 - getting to celebrate the new year's
23:14 - together like i actually think that's
23:16 - pretty freaking cool right
23:18 - that's awesome that gets me so hyped up
23:21 - like thank you guys for actually being
23:23 - on here i appreciate you guys so much
23:25 - and uh antonio that's actually a really
23:27 - dope background i just noticed
23:30 - so causey yeah you you so far along you
23:33 - talked about github
23:34 - and he never mentioned linkedin is that
23:37 - one thing that recruiters don't look at
23:39 - no i look at that too so i'll click on
23:41 - the resume and then i'll click on
23:43 - linkedin
23:43 - yeah i will definitely recruiters look
23:46 - at it for sure
23:49 - that's a that's a good catch so uh but
23:52 - i'll tell you what i look for i'm
23:53 - looking for
23:54 - like i'll go and see what's your you
23:56 - know usually people have their photos on
23:58 - there so i'm gonna go see
23:59 - okay what's your um you know what what's
24:01 - your personality like do you seem like a
24:03 - friendly
24:04 - person i'll see what you're writing
24:05 - about what's your past experience and i
24:07 - might look at your endorsements
24:09 - endorsements is one another thing that's
24:11 - kind of important
24:13 - so yeah here
24:16 - if you had a portfolio jorge i would
24:19 - want to definitely take a look at your
24:21 - portfolio
24:22 - um github wise for me this
24:26 - is you know there's just not a lot of
24:28 - action going on
24:30 - sometimes you know people are working on
24:31 - private repositories i understand that
24:33 - that's possible but if your portfolio
24:36 - doesn't catch my eye
24:37 - and then i go dig deeper into your
24:39 - github and that also doesn't really
24:41 - catch my eye
24:42 - and i feel like there's like um kind of
24:45 - you know new level projects that you
24:47 - might be doing
24:48 - then i'm gonna be likely to skip past it
24:51 - if that makes sense
24:53 - so for me personally i definitely want
24:56 - to see
24:56 - more code or more projects i think
24:58 - that'd be a great sign
25:01 - okay cool so projects is i need to
25:04 - go ahead i'm sorry i i need to
25:08 - start doing more projects i mean and add
25:10 - them to
25:11 - my profile yes please and add them and
25:14 - like okay so let's say i go to one of
25:16 - your uh
25:16 - let's say i go to this right well if i'm
25:19 - a recruiter and i go to this
25:21 - i want to see a link to to check this
25:25 - out
25:26 - i might not understand the code that
25:28 - much so i want to see what this
25:30 - is about and what what's what's on the
25:33 - website i want to see
25:34 - that uh as well and when i look at the
25:36 - code
25:37 - it it doesn't seem like a lot of code so
25:41 - you know i i can't really figure out the
25:44 - your skill level from this project
25:47 - so that's one thing i recommend you guys
25:49 - any projects you have
25:50 - always make it really easy
25:54 - to to um always have links
25:58 - okay so i can click your thing and check
26:00 - your demo
26:02 - uh make it so that there's a readme this
26:05 - does not have a readme that's another
26:07 - like bad sign
26:08 - so readme should give me clear
26:10 - instructions on what this is and how i
26:12 - can use it
26:13 - a link to the actual working application
26:17 - huge things guys you get gets you
26:19 - massive points
26:42 - uh where would you have the video i'm
26:43 - sorry so if you clicked on the app
26:46 - right so like here yeah yeah and then
26:48 - you went you said
26:50 - in the about
27:01 - um okay
27:05 - that's a tough one i would
27:08 - i would give the recruiter an option
27:10 - because recruiters like
27:12 - i have to go through 50 job applications
27:14 - or 100 job applications you know and i
27:16 - only have like 20 minutes 30 minutes of
27:18 - time
27:18 - so on average recruiters won't take more
27:20 - than five to seven seconds
27:22 - if there's a link of your app i just get
27:24 - to use it and check it out really fast
27:26 - if i have to go through a video
27:27 - that might take me a long time and your
27:30 - explanation
27:31 - of going through it so i'd recommend if
27:34 - you want to do that put two options
27:36 - right like here's the what i would
27:38 - actually recommend is
27:39 - in the readme i would put a
27:43 - guide on how to use this or what this
27:45 - software is and i would put that
27:47 - demoing the app i think that was that
27:49 - would be really great if it's you
27:50 - demoing the app
27:51 - and you're like here there's here this
27:54 - project
27:59 - [Music]
28:07 - [Music]
28:10 - is there a way i can mute everyone and
28:13 - then
28:23 - thank you so if you want to talk joe
28:24 - just go ahead and mute yourself
28:27 - so yeah i would recommend adding like a
28:29 - demo
28:30 - oh crap i got it
28:33 - i would recommend adding in the demo
28:36 - like a little video demo
28:38 - of the app that's a great sign hey
28:40 - here's how the blog page works
28:42 - here i'm using react routers to switch
28:44 - between the pages that's why you don't
28:45 - see a refresh
28:46 - here i'm using redux to manage the state
28:49 - that's why when you're going between
28:50 - this file and this file
28:52 - you know the the data layer has you know
28:55 - this
28:55 - is managing the state and blah blah blah
28:58 - so as you're going through the
28:59 - app that's how i would recommend to to
29:01 - do it if you were demoing it okay
29:05 - so great let's um
29:09 - yep so that's one thing i really liked
29:12 - about anton
29:13 - he had bunch of projects and then he had
29:15 - i mean this is by peloton so when i see
29:17 - peloton i'm like okay that's a big
29:19 - deal to have your name with peloton but
29:22 - i definitely still
29:23 - another thing i um thought was great
29:26 - about anton
29:27 - is he actually submitted a cover letter
29:30 - most people don't submit cover letters
29:32 - so he went above and beyond on that
29:35 - and whenever you submit a cover letter
29:38 - i'd highly recommend to try to make it
29:41 - to make it um as specific to the person
29:45 - that you're applying for the job you're
29:46 - applying for as possible
29:49 - okay so this is for design
29:53 - i really recommend yeah like learning
29:56 - some design skills guys
29:58 - they are so valuable and even if you
30:01 - have a simple app
30:02 - that's not the most complicated app on
30:04 - the planet you have to understand that
30:05 - as a recruiter
30:07 - uh i'm seeing what catches my eye i'm
30:10 - scanning really really fast
30:12 - so if i go to your portfolio and it's
30:14 - money
30:15 - and it's it gets me the information i'm
30:17 - looking for fast
30:19 - that's all i need does that make sense
30:22 - right and then once i see what your
30:24 - things look like
30:26 - then my next step is to jump into your
30:28 - code a little bit
30:30 - but in the start not so much in the
30:32 - start i'm just like
30:33 - visually seeing so these are some great
30:36 - resources you guys can write down about
30:37 - like shape.so is one good resource
30:40 - for illustrations and design and
30:43 - angle.sh is another good resource and it
30:45 - works well with figma and sketch and all
30:47 - of that
30:48 - so learn some basic skills just
30:51 - be dangerous enough you know you don't
30:54 - have to go crazy with this
30:57 - um a resource i discovered a few days
30:59 - ago which was
31:00 - awesome is stack blitz and
31:03 - they are i think in react documentation
31:09 - they actually refer to stack blitz as
31:11 - well so
31:12 - it's it's pretty legit platform and it's
31:15 - the only platform i saw that allows you
31:17 - to put
31:18 - things together really really really
31:21 - fast
31:22 - so if you're building a react project or
31:24 - whatever it is
31:25 - this allows you to it's the most
31:27 - lightning fast one
31:28 - that i've found and another really cool
31:31 - thing about them
31:32 - is one click it allows you to host to
31:35 - firebase
31:37 - so the whole time you're creating your
31:40 - app it's showing up here and it's live
31:42 - so already do you guys see that link
31:44 - it's not just localhost this app is
31:46 - already hosted
31:47 - so anybody can go and check it out so if
31:49 - i change this to say
31:51 - hello atharva you know or hello
31:54 - react js lovers
31:58 - but heart sign here right and save it
32:01 - if you go to this link this app is
32:04 - already hosted and this app is already
32:06 - uh running which is super cool so it
32:09 - really makes it easy for sharing
32:11 - it already has the react project like
32:13 - create app thing done
32:15 - and you can very easily see what
32:17 - dependencies
32:18 - your project has and if you need to
32:19 - install any
32:22 - so source good resource that i
32:25 - i highly recommend that you guys you
32:27 - guys use
32:29 - do you have to be a member though to get
32:31 - to be able to save your
32:33 - um your ads um to save
32:36 - i don't think you have to be a member i
32:38 - don't know why i became a member
32:40 - i started paying for it but to save i
32:43 - don't think you need to be a member
32:46 - because that's cool yeah yeah you don't
32:50 - need that
32:51 - code sandbox is another one they're both
32:53 - really good but stack blitz was just
32:54 - faster it was lightning fast
32:57 - and it actually is using visual studio
32:59 - code
33:00 - so you can just download your extensions
33:02 - and whatever you want just like how you
33:04 - would in
33:05 - in visual studio code another thing
33:08 - i want to talk to you guys about is who
33:11 - here
33:12 - knows about
33:16 - class components in react raise your
33:18 - hands or say aye
33:20 - cool so a few people who here knows
33:23 - about functional components in react
33:28 - okay cool so these are both good things
33:31 - to know about
33:32 - and understand if you know functional
33:34 - components don't skip on class-based
33:36 - components
33:37 - make sure you understand them because
33:40 - a lot of tutorials are in class-based
33:43 - components
33:43 - okay i thorough i'm sure like you
33:45 - probably looked it up in a lot of them
33:47 - still class-based right yeah
34:03 - yeah so many jobs are still using this
34:05 - right
34:06 - like and functional components is the
34:08 - new way to go
34:10 - so a lot of jobs still are on
34:12 - class-based components and then they're
34:13 - trying to move to
34:15 - functional components so
34:24 - uh no that's uh associated with uh
34:27 - react js but i think in react native you
34:30 - probably have them as well
34:32 - i imagine yeah you actually have them
34:35 - you can use it
34:40 - yeah whether you're doing react js or
34:42 - react native i think
34:43 - they're both there functional versus
34:45 - class-based components
34:47 - i think the only main difference between
34:49 - react js and react native is
34:52 - instead of those like html elements
34:54 - you're writing those like
34:56 - yes you're writing those like view
34:59 - and whatever right viewport and
35:02 - those types of i mean yes
35:12 - yep all right so great so that's good
35:16 - now let's so yeah this is a good
35:18 - resource to be able to do that and like
35:20 - look
35:20 - if you forgot how to export a function
35:23 - or you forgot some syntax
35:24 - it gets you up and running right away so
35:26 - you can always see what the boilerplate
35:29 - react app looks like without any of that
35:31 - additional
35:32 - you know additional code
35:35 - okay cool so make sure you understand
35:38 - you know the difference between
35:39 - you know when i when i write class-based
35:42 - components will look like
35:44 - class you know app extends
35:47 - react.component that's kind of what
35:49 - they'll look like
35:50 - if i'm not mistaken and then your
35:52 - class-based ones will look like
35:55 - this our function base will look just
35:57 - like that
35:58 - it'll be like function app whatever or
36:01 - what you might also see
36:02 - is this type of
36:06 - notation boom
36:13 - all right cool so that is a good
36:16 - resource
36:17 - and uh let's go here this is a great
36:20 - resource for you guys to go through and
36:22 - understand
36:23 - so this is a react job interview from a
36:26 - recruiter perspective
36:27 - i actually use this to prepare better
36:29 - for the interviews that i was doing with
36:31 - people
36:32 - okay so it has some key questions in
36:35 - here
36:36 - that it asks and you guys should know
36:38 - these questions when you post the link
36:40 - in the chat if you don't mind
36:42 - sure thing um
36:45 - and if any of you guys are watching this
36:46 - on youtube if you could please post this
36:48 - link on youtube as well that'd be great
36:54 - awesome thank you i just posted
36:57 - okay uh and if david is here if you can
37:00 - ask amanat for the 30 day react
37:01 - challenge
37:02 - link that would be cool too all right
37:08 - so these are lists of questions
37:11 - that are good these are not the only
37:13 - questions so if you prepared for them
37:15 - that does not mean you are now
37:17 - ready to get any react job there to give
37:20 - you
37:20 - a sense of you know what's going on
37:24 - okay
37:28 - so there are some questions that you
37:30 - guys should know about that are
37:31 - important so a lot of questions are
37:33 - behavioral questions that you will be
37:35 - asked
37:36 - i ask these all the time can you tell me
37:38 - about
37:39 - your previous job how did you fit in
37:41 - with the team
37:42 - now in in the book hiring for attitude
37:46 - what he says is it's bad to ask leading
37:48 - questions
37:49 - so some recruiters might not ask you
37:52 - leading questions
37:53 - so do you guys see the part where it
37:55 - says how did you fit in with the team
37:57 - that's a leading question do you guys
37:58 - understand what i mean when i say that
38:02 - yeah no leading meaning
38:05 - it needs so like for example what if
38:08 - there were 400 times
38:11 - or let's say what if there were 499
38:14 - times
38:15 - where you did not fit in with the team
38:19 - okay but there was one time so there was
38:22 - only one time you did fit in with the
38:24 - team
38:24 - when you ask me this leading question i
38:27 - will give you this example where
38:28 - one time in my life i did fit in with
38:30 - the team does that make sense
38:33 - yep if i don't ask this lead in question
38:36 - as a recruiter
38:39 - then it's up to you to answer it and if
38:41 - you don't answer that and you don't tell
38:43 - me that then it
38:44 - probably might mean that you did not
38:46 - really fit well with your team
38:49 - uh but they will ask you i just want you
38:51 - to be aware that they will ask you
38:53 - open-ended questions okay so
38:57 - when that happens just make sure that
39:00 - you're answering truthfully and over
39:02 - communicate don't under communicate okay
39:04 - so they might be looking for
39:06 - you know you talking but you also
39:08 - talking about maybe
39:10 - how you went above and beyond one
39:11 - question i ask is could you tell me
39:13 - about a time
39:15 - uh you know you had a difficult
39:17 - situation with a co-worker
39:18 - somebody who's a negative person might
39:21 - actually or as a problem
39:23 - maker instead of a problem solver
39:25 - they'll be like
39:27 - oh yeah there was this one time i worked
39:29 - with joe it was just he was just so
39:31 - negative and he was just so down
39:32 - and like you know you couldn't get pa
39:35 - anything past
39:36 - joe so eventually i just like thought
39:38 - okay you know
39:39 - um i i should just give up and and uh
39:43 - you know and then we just agreed to
39:44 - disagree and that was it so that's
39:46 - what does that sound like somebody who's
39:47 - a problem solver or problem maker
39:52 - problem problem maker right but if there
39:54 - was somebody else who was like hey
39:56 - yeah joe you know he had a negative
39:58 - outlook uh but
40:00 - i went and i saw that joe wasn't feeling
40:02 - good about this but i explained it to
40:03 - him from my perspective
40:05 - and i really worked with him to see
40:07 - maybe some benefits of this project and
40:09 - eventually joe was on board and joe
40:10 - actually even helped us like crush it on
40:12 - this project now does that sound
40:13 - like somebody who's a problem maker or a
40:16 - problem solver
40:17 - problem solver that's a problem solver
40:19 - right so
40:21 - that's the type of stuff that you're
40:22 - looking for here
40:24 - and there are a bunch of other questions
40:25 - then at some point they they recommend
40:27 - asking technical questions too right so
40:29 - some technical things
40:30 - that are good to understand for you guys
40:33 - there are a bunch of technical things
40:34 - here that you guys can look at
40:36 - so you know they'll ask questions about
40:38 - what's the difference between
40:39 - class-based components and functional
40:41 - components
40:43 - right um in a class-based component
40:46 - where is a good time to call the
40:48 - api and load data so those are um
40:52 - important as well all right so let me
40:55 - just
40:56 - highlight this one boom
40:59 - okay cool so that's good
41:02 - and then what do i have here
41:10 - hiring for attitude that's a good book
41:12 - for recruiters
41:21 - uh yeah you might you might get some
41:23 - insight
41:24 - but that book is like pretty advanced in
41:26 - a way that like
41:28 - it mostly talks about things that most
41:30 - recruiters are not doing
41:32 - you know and like it talks about how to
41:34 - solve that problem with recruiters and
41:36 - like what types of questions to ask for
41:38 - and so i'm
41:38 - i'm learning how to be a better
41:40 - recruiter but yeah read it and
41:42 - maybe it might give you some insight
41:46 - just overall from you know if you guys
41:49 - want to keep it simple
41:50 - on your end and not have to learn
41:52 - everything on the planet
41:54 - get really good technical skills with
41:56 - react understand how it's working at a
41:58 - really deep level so yes
42:00 - building clones will help you but on top
42:03 - of that what's going to really help you
42:04 - is a really solid understanding of how
42:08 - react
42:08 - works how does it work under the hood
42:12 - you know what are props
42:15 - what are states what's prop drilling
42:18 - how do you what does it mean when
42:20 - somebody says lifting a state
42:22 - up of the app so there are technical
42:24 - things that you should understand as
42:25 - well
42:26 - above and beyond that understand how to
42:29 - answer behavioral questions that's
42:32 - really really key okay so i cannot
42:35 - emphasize that enough most of the
42:37 - you you won't get into the second or the
42:39 - third round of the interviews
42:40 - until you're answering your be
42:44 - the behavioral questions that they ask
42:45 - you so if they identify that you might
42:47 - be somebody who's a problem maker
42:49 - they're not going to move you on to the
42:50 - next rounds
42:53 - so yeah actually joe now that i'm
42:54 - thinking about it it's probably a good
42:56 - book to read
42:58 - because it does talk about what good
42:59 - answers look like you know versus what
43:02 - bad answers look like
43:03 - so they actually give you a big list of
43:07 - good answers and bad answers and that
43:08 - that's usually really helpful
43:18 - as opposed to a disadvantage right yeah
43:20 - that's true you do
43:22 - that's true so uh what i want to do
43:25 - right now is
43:26 - open it up to you guys and whether you
43:28 - guys want to ask me questions or whether
43:30 - you guys want me to go
43:31 - through your portfolio definitely jump
43:34 - in
43:34 - and i would love to do that you know
43:36 - whether you want me to go to your
43:37 - portfolio or your pr
43:38 - or your github yeah i would like you to
43:41 - go in mine i posted it in the
43:42 - chat okay so nakanji wants
43:46 - me to go through your uh portfolio so
43:49 - i had a question okay
43:53 - so this is the thing i also covered in
43:55 - my video but uh
43:56 - what if some person just comes to you
43:58 - and gives you a portfolio so hopefully
44:00 - you can be of two type
44:01 - so i'm talking about the domain name so
44:03 - it can be atarwajostre.com or it can be
44:06 - through this dot heroku
44:09 - so does it make any difference as a
44:11 - recruiter you see netflix
44:14 - from our herocoat.com in the url will it
44:17 - sound unprofessional to you
44:18 - i personally don't care that much about
44:21 - where you
44:22 - host it i
44:25 - i mean about the domain name yeah i know
44:27 - that's what i'm saying like domain wise
44:28 - i don't really care that much about the
44:30 - domain
44:31 - i maybe a little bit of bias like when i
44:35 - see herokuapp.com i'm like is this
44:37 - person a student
44:39 - you know are they just like recently
44:40 - learning this stuff
44:42 - um and often times when i do see heroku
44:45 - app.com and when i see these ones it it
44:48 - does turn out that a lot of them are
44:49 - like students and stuff
44:51 - so it's it's a little bit of a bias but
44:53 - that could also just be me as a
44:55 - recruiter
44:56 - uh so if you you know but i would focus
44:58 - more on the
44:59 - types of projects you're building rather
45:01 - than your because if you have good
45:03 - projects and it looks damn good i don't
45:05 - care it could have a whatever domain
45:07 - name and it'll still be good
45:12 - okay so looking at this here
45:15 - let's see
45:18 - oh oh crap my bad sorry guys so looking
45:22 - at this project
45:23 - here um or or the
45:26 - uh github so one thing i recommend for
45:29 - you guys is
45:30 - code stacker has this really good video
45:32 - on youtube
45:35 - him and i should do a collab if somebody
45:37 - wants to send
45:39 - him this part of me talking about his
45:41 - channel please do
45:42 - i'd love to collab with him at some
45:44 - point he's i love his videos they're
45:46 - great
45:47 - so he has one on github readme
45:50 - you guys should definitely check this
45:52 - out
45:54 - and uh you can make your profile look
45:57 - awesome so
45:58 - for example this is what it would look
46:12 - like
46:14 - so this is an example of what your new
46:17 - github profile would look like
46:20 - you know if somebody lands here and see
46:23 - this that's much better than them just
46:26 - seeing the repos would you agree
46:31 - right so uh take advantage
46:34 - this looks really good right so make it
46:37 - make your github look
46:38 - like this i mean when i see 1500
46:41 - contributions that's a really real i
46:42 - mean that's really good sign right
46:44 - that's somebody who's like
46:45 - coding actively i can even see here
46:48 - whether it was commits or code reviews
46:50 - if it's commits that to me that means
46:52 - this person is
46:52 - actually coding right like if it's
46:56 - simply code reviews and they're not
46:58 - doing that that difficult of tasks
47:02 - um i also like to see contributions so
47:05 - i see that this person contributed to
47:08 - actually a few
47:10 - different um
47:13 - wow so let's see renderless
47:18 - readme stats okay so let's go here so it
47:21 - seems like this person actually
47:22 - contributed to that that's a
47:24 - really good sign unless that's his
47:26 - library
47:28 - if it is that's pretty freaking sick
47:32 - but yeah there you go so
47:39 - if you watch that video that video tells
47:41 - you how to make your github profile like
47:42 - that
47:49 - okay jesus that's aggressive
47:55 - all right so let's go through more do
47:58 - you guys have more portfolios you guys
47:59 - want me to go through so let's see here
48:01 - we got um
48:02 - awani has a portfolio as well so let's
48:04 - take a look at it and if you guys have
48:06 - portfolio websites
48:08 - you know send me those as well so if not
48:11 - just your github so send me that
48:13 - so if i look at this as a recruiter i
48:16 - kind of immediately know
48:18 - uh this is somebody who's a student or
48:20 - learning right now
48:23 - which is you know there's nothing wrong
48:25 - with it but
48:26 - um you know contributions wise awani
48:30 - great job
48:30 - this was really great amount of
48:32 - contributions in a short amount of time
48:34 - so keep that up okay
48:38 - and are you there by the way awani yeah
48:40 - yeah yeah
48:42 - okay so good job on the contributions
48:44 - let's see previous years if you did
48:46 - anything
48:47 - so a little bit here and there
48:51 - but this year it seems like it's the
48:52 - year where you're actually focusing on
48:54 - coding so good job
48:56 - contributions i definitely want to see
48:59 - or sorry uh
49:00 - yeah yeah definitely see so yeah
49:03 - i would say you know um you're probably
49:06 - new to coding
49:08 - how new are you i have a huge break in
49:12 - between like i used to work but then i
49:14 - took a break
49:18 - okay so if you can work on some projects
49:20 - that are your own
49:21 - i think that'd be a really good sign
49:25 - because if i go through your projects
49:26 - that you've worked on then
49:28 - boom you know that's like like for
49:31 - example
49:33 - if i go to my
49:39 - uh what is it repositories
49:46 - actually i'm gonna get out of here for
49:48 - now
49:49 - just because
49:52 - if i can find it i don't know if it's a
49:55 - private repo or not
49:56 - let's see private
50:03 - so like for example if you're going
50:04 - through this project right
50:06 - this is not some big clone of some kind
50:10 - of app
50:10 - but this is a python django project and
50:13 - if you go through it
50:14 - you'll see oh okay 265 commits
50:17 - if you go into insights
50:22 - the insights will also tell you like how
50:24 - much
50:25 - how much people were committing
50:28 - and what's the code frequency so there's
50:31 - a lot of
50:32 - code that was added and deleted over a
50:34 - period of time
50:35 - in 2016 and if you even go through
50:40 - this project there's a lot going on and
50:43 - you can see the code so you can go
50:44 - through it and you can be like okay so
50:46 - this is what's happening here let's go
50:47 - look at models
50:49 - okay a lot is happening here
50:56 - right that's that's not when you see
50:59 - just that one file
51:01 - that to you doesn't seem like this is
51:02 - somebody who just started coding right
51:05 - and it also might mean that this is not
51:08 - just a
51:09 - uh project that somebody found on um
51:14 - like a random website this is like a
51:16 - full-on project that they're doing from
51:17 - scratch and then there's like
51:19 - tons of documentation that goes along
51:20 - with it and that was just one file out
51:23 - of
51:23 - all of the files that i've shown so this
51:25 - is a really really massive project
51:28 - so this project alone can be pretty good
51:32 - for like if i wanted to go in the job
51:34 - market this
51:35 - alone would be pretty good for landing
51:36 - me jobs for a really long time
51:39 - so it's a it's a good that's why if you
51:42 - guys instead of working on
51:43 - many many projects if you spent three
51:46 - months six months nine months working on
51:48 - one project
51:49 - i think that's that's a really smart
51:51 - idea because
51:52 - you don't really improve that much
51:53 - development skills honestly guys when
51:55 - you just keep working on
51:56 - more projects you will improve your
51:58 - skills a lot by just working on
52:00 - one project for a really long time okay
52:05 - so would recommend that really strongly
52:09 - okay
52:13 - go for it timothy so first of all thank
52:16 - you so much for doing this for all of us
52:21 - um
52:22 - javascript was it possible that you
52:26 - could um
52:43 - you want me to put the link for what
52:47 - you were talking about how to like
52:50 - navigate through the github
52:52 - uh okay so that video oh what did i
52:55 - do with that video
52:57 - thank you um did i not put that
53:01 - can somebody please put that video uh
53:03 - it's by code stacker and it's called
53:05 - github or readme somebody could please
53:07 - put that in the chat
53:08 - um code stacker github readme that's the
53:12 - if you
53:12 - youtube that it'll come up somebody can
53:14 - put the link and then uh
53:17 - outside of that my uh
53:20 - front-end skills are bad okay my ui ux
53:23 - skills are not that good
53:24 - i myself am now trying to learn and
53:27 - improve my skills so i'm personally
53:29 - going through uh this these guys uh this
53:32 - guy's course
53:33 - right now you know when i look at his
53:35 - front end i'm like this is the type of
53:37 - front end i would want to have on my
53:39 - website
53:40 - it just looks freaking gorgeous like
53:43 - look at this every single thing
53:44 - is just made with so much love and it's
53:47 - so good
53:49 - you know so i am going i'm going through
53:53 - this personally to improve my skills
53:56 - if i could recommend you something you
53:58 - know
54:00 - there are probably a lot better people
54:02 - than me that would
54:03 - give you better recommendations but one
54:05 - thing that i would recommend is
54:08 - have inspirations so
54:11 - like i know that you probably use
54:14 - dribble but whatever you're building
54:15 - try to build off of some inspiration
54:17 - that looks really good
54:19 - for me even though i'm bad at ui ux
54:22 - because
54:22 - i have a good eye in what looks good
54:26 - and you know what is simple enough and
54:28 - what looks good enough
54:29 - that alone makes me really good at it
54:32 - because
54:33 - i can just copy i can see what those are
54:36 - looking like so i can
54:37 - model it in my own design so
54:40 - that's one thing i would recommend
54:42 - outside of that
54:43 - i think that course is a really good
54:45 - place and
54:46 - uh yeah tommy hopefully that that helps
54:49 - a little bit
54:55 - yeah happy new year awesome
55:00 - let's see alan allen benjamin
55:04 - so are you here alex i'm here oh
55:08 - do you guys have this new chrome update
55:10 - which sucks
55:11 - as well that always crashes yeah yeah
55:15 - oh jesus
55:27 - um yeah goodness
55:34 - oh these logos look delicious
55:37 - okay so let's go here
55:41 - we got alan benjamin
55:44 - okay um dope photo
55:48 - really nice suit if you can
55:51 - have a simpler photo where you're
55:54 - smiling
55:54 - might be better just because if i'm on a
55:57 - screen that's not as big as mine or i'm
55:59 - on a phone i might not be able to see
56:00 - you that much
56:02 - so i think it might look better like
56:04 - that um
56:06 - outside of that on the portfolio side
56:09 - let's see so 56 contributions so
56:12 - you know it seems like uh i want you to
56:15 - have more contributions
56:16 - for sure this is you know to me it seems
56:19 - like
56:20 - you recently started coding around
56:22 - september
56:26 - is that right or no well
56:32 - okay cool yeah and then in terms of your
56:34 - projects like make your
56:36 - ma have some interesting projects that
56:39 - you know like when i look at them
56:40 - they're not because a lot of them it
56:44 - seems like they're from tutorials which
56:46 - is okay
56:47 - but what i recommend is you know sure
56:50 - gets get uh amazon clone or something
56:52 - like that from
56:54 - a tutorial but there's nothing stopping
56:56 - you from
56:57 - forking it and turning it into your own
56:59 - full projects and adding in like
57:01 - full-on e-commerce functionality adding
57:03 - in a dark mode and a light mode
57:06 - you know adding in fancy cards
57:10 - one thing that i was laughing at and i'm
57:12 - thinking about making a series on when i
57:14 - get my design skills better
57:16 - is um a 2050
57:20 - series so what it's going to be like is
57:22 - it's going to be amazon and
57:24 - airbnb but in a futuristic 2050 design
57:26 - or what i think would be a futuristic
57:28 - design
57:29 - so i would just try to make it look
57:31 - really damn good
57:33 - um you know and uh just something that's
57:36 - fun and unique
57:37 - so i would recommend having doing that
57:40 - so these projects are your own
57:43 - and then let me go here also when i go
57:46 - to your projects there's no readme
57:49 - and there's no link so to me it makes
57:51 - you seem inconsiderate
57:54 - because if i'm about to hire somebody on
57:57 - my team i'm like it seems like this
57:58 - person doesn't really
57:59 - care like doesn't really if you were on
58:03 - a team
58:03 - with my other software developers i
58:05 - wouldn't want you on that team because
58:07 - i'd be thinking
58:08 - this is the guy that's not going to ride
58:09 - the readmes is going to do just his own
58:11 - thing
58:12 - and there's no documentation isn't
58:14 - making it life any easier for any other
58:15 - developer so i'm out
58:20 - so i would highly recommend to add
58:23 - additional readmes wherever you can
58:26 - add in links to the project so you know
58:28 - if
58:29 - if i'm a recruiter and you built this
58:32 - clone then definitely
58:34 - make it easy for me to see it okay okay
58:37 - um i don't know if you guys are familiar
58:39 - with readme but this file whatever you
58:41 - have in it
58:42 - right will show up down here
58:50 - [Music]
59:03 - center yeah it's uh it's a markdown file
59:06 - so if you guys know a little bit of
59:07 - markdown you can easily do it
59:10 - uh with markdown but yeah you can you
59:12 - can do it from wherever you could change
59:13 - it from github you could change it from
59:15 - your local environment push it to github
59:18 - but you know one thing i definitely want
59:20 - to see from people who are new like if
59:22 - you're new
59:23 - at least show me you're really really
59:25 - hungry so
59:27 - if this is really filled with green
59:28 - really good sign
59:30 - if there are projects outside of the
59:32 - amazon clone that also shows me you're
59:34 - hungry and you want more
59:36 - and you're doing coding on your own not
59:38 - just
59:39 - copying from somewhere or modeling from
59:42 - somewhere and then
59:43 - it's like okay i'm gonna do just enough
59:46 - to have a portfolio to get a job
59:47 - so try to go above and beyond it and
59:50 - that's a really
59:51 - really good sign okay but good job you
59:54 - have tons of repositories that you're
59:55 - working on
59:56 - and you have tons of coding stuff you're
59:59 - doing so that's really good and let's
60:00 - see what's happening here 60 days of
60:02 - react
60:03 - okay cool that's good and
60:08 - let's see okay adding nycd to digital
60:13 - clock okay
60:14 - so i'm not sure what nvice nycd is so
60:18 - you know um i think sometimes it's
60:20 - helpful to add your commits in a way
60:22 - where they're readable
60:23 - so if i go down to your commit level
60:27 - you know can i understand what you're
60:29 - doing because if you're working on
60:31 - on on my team as a software developer i
60:33 - definitely want you to be
60:35 - adding stuff that makes a lot of sense
60:37 - right so then we can easily backtrack
60:39 - or understand what's happening in the
60:42 - software
60:44 - so for you a lot of what i will say
60:47 - um benjamin is do you go by alan or
60:50 - benjamin
60:54 - got it so what i would say benjamin is a
60:57 - lot of
60:57 - um you can't go wrong with adding
61:00 - documentation readme and like links to
61:02 - your projects i think that is
61:04 - where i really would want you to focus
61:06 - and start there
61:08 - i think especially for beginners you
61:10 - guys you have
61:11 - you know if you're um in a beginner or
61:13 - intermediate or you don't have ton of
61:15 - job experience
61:16 - i cannot stress enough how far read
61:20 - good read me's and good um documentation
61:23 - will take you
61:24 - it will take you so far because you can
61:27 - be not a great developer but i
61:29 - if i know you're considerate and you
61:30 - care so much about the team and
61:33 - you're making it easy to use i know
61:35 - you're going to be
61:36 - a pleasure to work with so
61:39 - then all i have to do is bring you on
61:41 - the team and let the senior developers
61:43 - take you on board and mentor you does
61:45 - that make sense have them guide you
61:47 - through the process and make you better
61:52 - so those are my thoughts on this
61:56 - cool i just dropped my portfolio
61:59 - i just deployed it right now oh you did
62:01 - okay so let me actually share the screen
62:03 - again
62:04 - and chat portfolio
62:08 - all right let's do
62:11 - this
62:14 - a tharva oh fancy
62:18 - fancy schmancy
62:22 - so that's cool
62:25 - okay and how does it look in mobile
62:32 - okay are you sure it looks good on the
62:34 - phone
62:36 - no i wanted to fix it okay so
62:39 - recruiters sometimes are going from the
62:40 - phone too one thing
62:42 - so let me see if i can do this
62:50 - see if i can
62:58 - okay i'm trying to find somebody's
63:00 - portfolio
63:03 - and i could find it that'd be really
63:06 - good
63:07 - so
63:14 - codes.com okay there we go so this was a
63:17 - really good portfolio this
63:19 - gentleman got an interview from us
63:22 - and i had an interview with him um
63:26 - this is really good so i would model
63:28 - this you guys
63:31 - keep it simple honestly if you try to
63:33 - add too many fanciness or too many
63:34 - animations
63:35 - and you don't even have to add this
63:36 - animation like you can you guys can keep
63:39 - it much much simpler than that and i
63:40 - would
63:41 - highly recommend that you guys do
63:43 - because when people
63:44 - start adding a lot of animations and a
63:46 - lot of fanciness that's where you go
63:47 - wrong and
63:49 - it doesn't actually look as good it just
63:51 - over complicates it so keep it really
63:53 - really simple
63:54 - i saw this i'm like okay really simple
63:57 - really clean
63:58 - i came down to projects super easy to
64:01 - understand what his projects are
64:04 - boom skills
64:07 - this is beautiful to look at right these
64:09 - are the skills that we're looking for
64:11 - great so good skill match you know these
64:14 - are the tools this person understands
64:16 - great and then contact so
64:20 - i recommend having a something simple
64:23 - as a good starting point and then you
64:25 - can improve on that
64:26 - so no atharva if i saw this i would
64:29 - really quickly hit the red x and i'd be
64:31 - out
64:32 - so i think that where you're going wrong
64:35 - with this
64:36 - so like if i'm looking to hire a front
64:39 - end developer
64:40 - their front end needs to be good
64:43 - so here it's right like you see the
64:46 - aspect ratios of the images the images
64:48 - have really low quality
64:52 - right yeah
64:55 - [Music]
64:56 - right so like really low quality images
64:58 - not really easy to understand
65:00 - what's happening it doesn't pop out so
65:02 - this is where you're going wrong
65:03 - you have to model something that is good
65:06 - so right now i don't know who you're
65:09 - modeling but try to model somebody
65:10 - you know that's that's doing a good job
65:12 - of it
65:14 - um a bunch of images even here like
65:16 - seems squeezed
65:18 - i don't know why like even a contact me
65:19 - button there looks like it's squeezed
65:22 - um you know this image aspect ratios are
65:25 - completely off
65:27 - so i would start off with a simple
65:31 - simple website that is functional
65:34 - and it looks good and that's it i would
65:37 - add additional fanciness later on but
65:40 - like
65:41 - as soon as i go to developers where the
65:43 - portfolio is not looking that great and
65:45 - it's a ui ux and like react developer
65:48 - i get out really really fast okay i
65:51 - could be doing it in an unfair way but i
65:53 - get out fast
65:56 - okay cool
66:02 - um
66:04 - all right let's see are there any other
66:05 - so hell okay are you here so hello
66:27 - so hell what's going on i i'm muting you
66:29 - right now because
66:30 - i'm not understanding what's happening
66:33 - okay
66:33 - so yes i'm here now
66:37 - okay okay cool all right
66:40 - so going through this okay full stack
66:44 - web and mobile developer
66:50 - this reads too long so you know it
66:53 - doesn't look that great
66:55 - and you know this seems like it's not
67:01 - properly aligned
67:04 - don't know why that is maybe maybe this
67:07 - part should be matching down here with
67:09 - the text editors part something seems
67:10 - uneven about this
67:13 - uh okay so clone clone
67:16 - dope and then let's go
67:19 - down okay clone
67:23 - so yeah it just seems like you got some
67:25 - projects
67:26 - but other than that like it's i if i saw
67:30 - this portfolio i would
67:31 - i would not i would decline okay so
67:35 - yeah i would work on your react skills
67:38 - and guys make your portfolios look good
67:42 - go look at a youtube video where
67:43 - somebody builds a portfolio watch how
67:45 - they do it
67:46 - build a good portfolio because if you
67:48 - don't have a good portfolio you're gonna
67:49 - get skipped over
67:51 - and it's just unfortunate you might have
67:52 - really good projects you might have all
67:54 - this stuff
67:55 - gonna get skipped over for you you i
67:58 - would recommend you build some of your
67:59 - own projects too
68:00 - because if i don't like your portfolio
68:03 - and how it looks and the
68:04 - design looks bad i'm already like not
68:06 - considering you
68:07 - then when i see the projects and they're
68:08 - all clones i'm definitely like okay i'm
68:10 - out
68:12 - i want to see stuff that's you know um
68:15 - that you also have done so let's go here
68:18 - to
68:20 - to github and let's see what we find in
68:22 - github
68:23 - okay cool picture um
68:27 - let's go all right and
68:30 - you know not a lot of contributions
68:35 - and um
68:40 - okay so when you're making your repos
68:43 - also make sure they're spelled correctly
68:45 - so like edit ter is misspelled as well
68:48 - so
68:48 - that's also not a good sign so for you
68:51 - to make it a productive conversation
68:53 - work on your actual reaction skills make
68:56 - your portfolio look good and add some of
68:57 - your own projects got it
69:00 - yes thank you for portfolio
69:05 - and http no javascript
69:09 - okay i mean yeah you should still be
69:11 - able to make it look good without
69:12 - anything else outside of html and css
69:15 - okay all right cool so i would work on
69:19 - uh
69:19 - front-end skills more all right
69:22 - um
69:27 - okay where is it can you link me again
69:32 - please
69:41 - this is nice so
69:45 - i'm immediately wowed
69:48 - so that's a really good sign okay uh
69:51 - if i'm a recruiter and i'm immediately
69:53 - wowed it's a really good sign so if i
69:55 - were one of you guys
69:56 - on here i would screenshot this right
69:58 - now and i would try to build something
70:01 - similar to this on my github
70:03 - really really good time to screenshot
70:05 - this
70:07 - already okay good so i know that code
70:10 - stacker
70:11 - teaches you how to build it like this
70:13 - but it's important to then go and
70:14 - actually do that
70:16 - all right let's go down
70:20 - okay decent amount of contributions this
70:22 - is good
70:23 - all right navbar react you got gmail
70:26 - clone you got linkedin clone
70:28 - travel agency 50 projects 50 days okay
70:31 - so you you've been working you've got
70:34 - 71 commits in december nice
70:38 - some good work latest youtube videos
70:40 - okay so what does that mean are these
70:42 - your videos or whose videos are these hi

70:47 - these are your videos
71:05 - nice okay where did it go wait what
71:08 - happened
71:10 - all right cool so yeah that's really
71:13 - really good if you're also explaining it
71:16 - and helping i mean dude if your
71:18 - recruiter sees this
71:19 - they're gonna interview you guaranteed
71:22 - if i saw this i would reach out and
71:24 - interview you um
71:27 - yeah it's pretty good and then you know
71:29 - you got good uh
71:30 - contributions you got good stuff going
71:32 - on yeah you're definitely gonna get an
71:34 - interview based off of this
71:37 - all right thank you awesome
71:41 - and you know if we could if we just go
71:43 - down and break it component by component
71:46 - okay you're a full stack developer good
71:49 - react javascript node.js and firebase
71:51 - okay
71:53 - okay master react complete learn
71:56 - contribute to open source projects okay
71:58 - cool so fun playful
72:01 - intelligent technologies visually i can
72:03 - see all the technology so
72:05 - as a recruiter i don't have to scan
72:06 - through his portfolio to see what tech
72:08 - stack he uses right i can immediately
72:11 - see that
72:12 - react in javascript and firebase is part
72:14 - of his stack
72:15 - so it's a good sign
72:21 - all right let's go back
72:25 - boom uh
72:28 - gurong you want me to go through yours
72:30 - right now
72:32 - okay should i do roasts should we turn
72:36 - this into a roast you guys
72:37 - ask you guys for a medium roast light
72:39 - roast or a dark roast or a decaf
72:41 - oh man
72:45 - what joe you don't want me to do it or
72:47 - you want me to do it no no no
72:52 - if you want a decaf then you don't get a
72:54 - then you just get the sweetest one
72:57 - all right who here is in 1980s right now
73:01 - and making the dial-up sounds
73:08 - let's mute everybody please
73:10 - [Applause]
73:13 - thank you i'm muted everybody
73:16 - got it thank you awesome so here we go
73:20 - what i don't know
73:28 - did we get him did we get the guy
73:34 - hello okay hopefully we got him whoever
73:37 - that was
73:39 - um okay
73:42 - so no this is a this is a
73:45 - no for me
73:48 - nice photo though you got a great
73:50 - personality
73:54 - okay so damn the kova tracker looking
73:59 - that's looking nice oh yeah this covert
74:01 - tracker is definitely going to get you
74:03 - guys job opportunities this is freaking
74:05 - sick
74:06 - why is it all red
74:10 - yeah this is a really good freaking
74:12 - project to have man
74:14 - yeah from a recruiter perspective now i
74:16 - see the value of that project
74:18 - and why it's so freaking powerful
74:22 - nice nice nice nice good good good
74:27 - so i would work on the
74:32 - [Music]
74:33 - [Applause]
74:35 - okay so you you'll i think that's you
74:37 - just keep yourself muted because there's
74:39 - a lot of
74:40 - background noise but just type in your
74:42 - chat
74:43 - you know just respond through chat or
74:45 - ask questions through chat
74:46 - but what i will say is
74:50 - improve your front-end skills so you
74:52 - know get better at css and get better at
74:55 - html and like understand how to make
74:57 - your website look nice
74:58 - model something that looks good and
75:00 - simple and
75:02 - guys the easiest way to go wrong is
75:04 - trying to do too much right so like
75:05 - adding this stuff in the background
75:07 - adding all this stuff in the background
75:09 - easy to really easy to go wrong if you
75:11 - just have
75:13 - white background or a black background
75:15 - you can't really go wrong that easily
75:17 - just a simple black background guys one
75:19 - type of text
75:20 - keep it really really simple also
75:22 - another thing right what's up with all
75:24 - this space
75:25 - that's not being used so you want to
75:28 - make sure that that's there
75:30 - oh that's cool some kind of react
75:33 - component
75:34 - animation here cool so yeah i would
75:37 - definitely
75:38 - um rebuild this page completely and
75:41 - you can model johnny's page okay this is
75:44 - a
75:44 - phenomenal page to model
75:48 - that's great so something like this keep
75:50 - it simple you can
75:51 - go and view his page source and see how
75:54 - see how he's doing it okay
75:56 - so that's what i would recommend
75:59 - all right vishesh has to go awesome well
76:03 - happy new year to you
76:05 - and um let's see is there anybody else
76:08 - who wants to go through it or are we
76:09 - good guys is there any other questions
76:10 - you guys have for me
76:11 - while i'm here i don't have a portfolio
76:14 - but i have a youtube channel
76:16 - uh not right now for youtube
76:21 - uh who was that um okay
76:25 - okay so you posted it got it let's go
76:28 - all right so hardeep uh smile in your
76:31 - photo you look like a serial killer no
76:33 - i'm kidding
76:34 - definitely smiling your photo okay you
76:36 - have great personality you're smiling
76:37 - already so
76:38 - you look pretty badass you know i'd be
76:40 - intimidated to work with you as a
76:41 - developer i'm like this guy can code
76:43 - better than me and he looks better than
76:44 - me and he's angry like this is
76:46 - intimidating
76:47 - so just add a smile in there and that
76:50 - would be great
76:54 - more contributions okay
76:58 - definitely say add improve the level of
77:01 - contributions
77:02 - this is good the greenery i see here
77:05 - is good clones are good but make sure
77:08 - you're also building some of your own
77:10 - projects
77:10 - all right um
77:15 - let's see okay
77:19 - tracker so you guys see the difference
77:23 - right
77:24 - for example it's really easy to scan
77:26 - this and know everything
77:27 - tech stack and all of that here i don't
77:31 - even immediately know that you it's
77:33 - you do react see what i'm saying it's
77:35 - not really immediately obvious to me
77:37 - unless i start reading the description
77:40 - of your github profiles so
77:43 - this is why this is beneficial for you
77:45 - to have something like this
77:47 - okay okay let's go through 2019
77:52 - no 2020 or 2018 not much all right
77:55 - so to me it looks like you recently
77:58 - started coding
77:59 - i don't know you might have been coding
78:00 - for a while
78:02 - no i just started recently okay so
78:05 - so i want to see some of your projects
78:07 - in there and do you have a portfolio or
78:09 - no
78:10 - no okay so definitely build a portfolio
78:14 - okay
78:18 - okay okay awesome
78:22 - so yeah so my recommendation to you
78:26 - build some of your own projects code
78:29 - more i want to see like 900 commits from
78:31 - you
78:32 - or a thousand plus commits from you in
78:33 - 2021
78:36 - you got it better portfolio better
78:39 - whatever you'll be ready
78:41 - okay resumes are really important too
78:45 - i've totally forgot to touch base on
78:47 - them i don't know why because i think we
78:49 - had already so much to cover
78:51 - do any of you guys want me to take a
78:52 - look at your resumes
78:58 - um okay drop the link
79:02 - okay so let's go through it okay
79:07 - smile more if you can okay
79:11 - like happy you know like it's it's
79:14 - really crazy guys how much it makes a
79:16 - difference people don't understand
79:18 - but it really really makes a difference
79:20 - okay if you're just happy and you're
79:22 - smiling i can see your teeth really good
79:25 - thing it gives you a little boost it's
79:27 - not gonna be the thing that gets you
79:29 - hired
79:29 - but it gives you a little boost not a
79:32 - lot of contributions so
79:33 - it's not that great
79:36 - man what oh dentures
79:40 - okay i mean i think you'll still look
79:42 - great
79:43 - it's it's probably not as bad as you
79:45 - think
79:47 - but if you're really insensitive or
79:49 - insecure about it it's okay just smile
79:50 - and just be a really good coder
79:52 - and you'll be fine
79:56 - [Music]
80:00 - okay so i went so that this will get you
80:03 - decline
80:04 - wait hold on yeah i think this is sick
80:14 - so that would get that would be enough
80:16 - to get you
80:17 - um declined okay
80:20 - so if you guys have like this is one of
80:22 - the biggest pet peeves guys
80:24 - for recruiters like you guys will put
80:26 - links but they're not updated
80:28 - and they link to somewhere where it goes
80:30 - to die all right it's really
80:33 - frustrating because you have limited
80:34 - time as a recruiter you click a link and
80:36 - boom it's dead or it's not updated or
80:38 - the site is down or the site is too slow
80:41 - if you guys do heroku app just one thing
80:43 - be careful heroku has like a freaking
80:46 - 40 second timer for the website to open
80:48 - up the first time it's so
80:50 - slow so try to this is why netlify i
80:53 - think
80:53 - is a good sign because like that's fast
80:56 - right that's pretty fast
80:58 - okay good so this is good go here
81:01 - boom boom i see your tools data qa full
81:04 - stack
81:05 - okay work nice
81:11 - uh visit website so let's see
81:14 - dope so i can see the website
81:18 - so here's what i would improve here i
81:20 - don't care what translink does
81:22 - this is not about translink this is your
81:24 - portfolio i don't
81:25 - i don't care that they are dedicated to
81:28 - creating and sustaining i'm a recruiter
81:30 - i don't give a what translink is
81:32 - i only care about this person that i'm
81:35 - trying to hire does that make sense
81:38 - yeah so i i want to see what you did you
81:40 - could have just done nothing
81:42 - and linked their website to me right now
81:43 - it seems like you did nothing and just
81:44 - linked their site
81:51 - so what did you do for them
82:03 - i did an internship at this company
82:08 - um i used python
82:26 - so like for example this is just a
82:29 - really short example right i would
82:30 - rather say something like this i would
82:32 - see okay
82:33 - so you did an internship you used python
82:36 - and you did some data visualizations for
82:38 - them you use postgres
82:39 - so here i want you to actually get
82:40 - technical in what you did
82:42 - right like i reduced their load time
82:45 - from
82:45 - uh this is one thing that a lot of
82:47 - people do and it's smart thing to do
82:49 - like
82:50 - are it their load time from
82:55 - 803 milliseconds down to
82:58 - 17 milliseconds i don't know what you
83:00 - did for them right
83:01 - but if you can quantify it that's a
83:03 - really good sign
83:05 - okay i'll change this one so boom boom
83:08 - i would definitely change all three of
83:10 - those in which you did
83:11 - that would be a great sign
83:15 - another thing i'd recommend is
83:19 - let's see what is this so here
83:22 - are those clickable by the way they're
83:24 - not clickable right
83:26 - what i would recommend is actually just
83:28 - put the tech stack here that you used
83:30 - so i would put the logo of python and i
83:32 - would put the logo of
83:34 - uh postgres and i would put the logo of
83:37 - if you i don't know what you use d3
83:41 - sequels i would put the logos of them
83:44 - and
83:45 - here as well if you can um you know
83:49 - see if you can put logos instead that
83:51 - are visible like this
83:54 - right like these are established logos
83:57 - and tools so it's a really good sign to
83:58 - do that because like
84:00 - you can speak with this but it's much
84:02 - better if i see your tools visually
84:05 - okay okay um
84:09 - okay cool wanna work with me nice okay
84:12 - this is pretty good oh nice you work for
84:14 - zoho
84:22 - so you have quite a bit of experience i
84:24 - would definitely highlight
84:25 - more of that somehow okay so
84:28 - you know i don't know if like yeah
84:35 - the only job it is
84:43 - i would still put that i would still put
84:44 - that somewhere
84:46 - you know your internship with python and
84:48 - this and uh
84:50 - communicate what technologies you're
84:51 - using because tons of
84:53 - new people are landing like you know
84:56 - johnny he's never gotten a job as a
84:59 - software developer actually
85:01 - so think about that right but he's got
85:03 - to interview with us so
85:05 - he did something that worked yeah
85:08 - okay so i would model i would model what
85:11 - works very
85:12 - closely i wouldn't try to worry about
85:13 - being unique being creative
85:15 - i would try to model it very closely if
85:17 - it worked then model it and
85:19 - just then work on improving your skill
85:21 - set
85:22 - okay thank you you got it
85:26 - all right
85:30 - mike torres um
85:33 - [Music]
85:34 - where is mike you on here mike
85:47 - okay okay got it awesome so um
85:51 - got it let me go and uh
85:55 - you want me to check out what first your
85:57 - github or what
85:59 - uh
86:05 - okay so that's a really good sign to me
86:09 - you got
86:09 - good amount of contributions this year
86:11 - that's really good
86:13 - and um i can also see that you're
86:16 - recently coding as well i always want to
86:18 - see that because if i see a drop-off
86:20 - after september or whatever i'm like are
86:21 - they losing interest in coding what's
86:23 - going on
86:24 - all right you got bunch of clones node
86:26 - app 2020. so
86:28 - let's see what's happening here so
86:31 - thank you for having a link and caring
86:34 - about
86:34 - other human beings so let's see if it
86:36 - works now this is another test
86:39 - yeah so this is why if you guys can
86:40 - avoid heroku app
86:42 - avoid it it's just such a slow load time
86:46 - right like
86:47 - you could be a great developer but if
86:48 - you have such a slow load time
86:50 - it kind of shows oh this person doesn't
86:52 - know about speed
86:53 - you know and like performance is really
86:55 - really important
86:57 - all right so let's go through this note
87:01 - uh what am i supposed to do what's
87:04 - happening here
87:07 - whoa okay so it just took probably some
87:09 - time for it to be generated
87:12 - all right whoa okay this is pretty cool
87:16 - but i don't know why everything moves
87:22 - okay let's click it that's dope
87:26 - yo what's going on man
87:31 - okay that's pretty dope that's actually
87:33 - really cool that's a cool app i like it
87:36 - um do you have uh any deeper level
87:39 - projects that you've done
87:43 - ah
87:51 - [Music]
87:58 - um
88:02 - yeah to be honest
88:14 - [Music]
88:17 - okay got it so yeah this is
88:20 - um what i like about this project is
88:23 - this is the project i would really pay a
88:25 - lot of attention to because there's a
88:27 - lot
88:28 - going on here and it seems like a deep
88:30 - project now one problem might have
88:32 - happened is you might not have learned
88:33 - that much because they might have gone
88:34 - at a really fast
88:35 - pace and had you build this
88:39 - but still like i want to see deeper
88:41 - level projects that you worked on
88:43 - and so when i see clones i like them but
88:46 - i also know that
88:48 - they're probably you know you might have
88:49 - modeled it from somewhere
88:51 - so i always want to see your ability to
88:54 - code
88:54 - if that can be highlighted i think
88:56 - that's a great sign
88:58 - okay yeah so like even when you guys
89:00 - have this type of stuff where bashes had
89:02 - his in the start
89:04 - if you guys have some of your own
89:05 - projects that you're working on
89:07 - i would recommend highlighting those
89:10 - right around here
89:12 - okay so some of your own projects you're
89:14 - working on i think that's a good because
89:16 - not everybody's making youtube videos so
89:18 - here put projects you're working on
89:20 - boom that's phenomenal
89:25 - okay other than that
89:30 - let's see your portfolio and what that
89:32 - looks like
89:33 - so let's go miketourez.com
89:40 - okay so it says not secure so see if you
89:42 - can figure out
89:43 - what's going on with https it takes a
89:45 - second to load
89:47 - i mean it takes a really long time to
89:48 - load so
89:50 - just be aware of performance issues
89:52 - looks great
89:54 - so it looks really good
89:58 - let's go here is are we sure it works
90:00 - really well on mobile too
90:03 - seems like it does nice job
90:06 - okay nice
90:11 - okay that's really good how you show
90:13 - your projects is really good
90:18 - okay you would get in you would get a
90:21 - you would get an interview you would
90:23 - definitely get an interview with this
90:25 - i would do only things i worry about and
90:27 - i would really recommend this and i keep
90:29 - coming back to this guys everybody gets
90:32 - caught up and being really fancy
90:34 - keep it keep it simple because you're
90:36 - going to run into a lot of issues we're
90:37 - going to load really slow
90:38 - and you know it doesn't mean you're a
90:40 - bad developer but
90:42 - if a recruiter doesn't even wait till
90:44 - it's finished loading they won't be able
90:45 - to see your skill set
90:48 - okay so highly recommend to make that
90:51 - faster okay and uh just remove any
90:54 - complexity it's okay you have to if you
90:56 - want to remove animations
90:58 - keep it simple and then just go through
90:59 - it and then it lets me get through to
91:02 - all the good stuff faster
91:05 - okay um let's see here
91:24 - okay linkedin oh linkedin is great
91:30 - linkedin is looks really good
91:33 - see if you can throw an image up here
91:35 - and have some logos in there like your
91:37 - tech stack
91:38 - i think that would bang i think that
91:40 - would be like really good so kind of
91:41 - like how you have
91:43 - um your portfolio image
91:46 - right the laptop so let's see
91:50 - so kind of have this image in the
91:52 - background
91:54 - but one thing so i imagine like a laptop
91:57 - and stuff right
91:58 - and the dark overlay but on top of that
92:01 - see if you can add
92:03 - your techstack logo so your mongodb or
92:05 - firebase or
92:06 - react logo javascript logo i think that
92:08 - would look phenomenal
92:10 - because then visually as a recruiter i
92:12 - immediately know what i'm hiring for
92:14 - right now
92:15 - i might actually think wait is this guy
92:16 - looking for a job in i.t
92:18 - is it for programming like what is it it
92:20 - takes me a second
92:21 - okay all right uh freelance web
92:24 - developer okay
92:35 - um okay so you have some experience as a
92:38 - developer that's a good sign
92:40 - let's go here a lot of people do this
92:42 - thing on linkedin that i see a lot open
92:44 - to work
92:46 - i don't know i don't really know how
92:47 - effective that is but
92:49 - if you guys want to do that you can just
92:52 - something i've noticed a lot when i'm
92:53 - recruiting
92:57 - okay you got some endorsements that's
92:58 - good
93:02 - cool so yeah your linkedin profile looks
93:06 - looks good
93:10 - there's a lot of stuff happening here
93:13 - which i don't really see how it's so
93:15 - super relevant to what you do
93:18 - as you say coding is much more than a
93:20 - passion but then it's like music
93:22 - and high school band director and jazz
93:24 - and
93:25 - dj and mc and dj business and wedding
93:27 - and
93:29 - um i'm scanning you see like i'm not
93:31 - reading i'm scanning
93:33 - yeah so change colors
93:36 - css from yellow to pink um
93:39 - you're you're spending a lot of time
93:41 - going through really like basic stuff i
93:43 - would
93:43 - i would rather use this for some
93:46 - something else and more relevant to
93:48 - coding
93:54 - yeah yeah i would i would go more meat
93:56 - and potatoes on it
93:59 - like recruiters go crazy over this type
94:02 - of stuff right like when i'm scanning
94:03 - for keywords visually
94:05 - if you can write it in a non like seo
94:09 - like not in a your hacking seo way but
94:11 - more like
94:13 - you know i i used um
94:17 - js designed the front end for the new
94:18 - company and i also integrated jquery and
94:21 - bootstrap to help with the front end and
94:22 - we integrated
94:24 - you know we were using git version
94:25 - control and
94:27 - we had heroku and vagrant to manage the
94:29 - environment like if you actually write
94:31 - that out
94:32 - really fast that and and right here that
94:34 - really catches my eye
94:36 - okay because that's remember recruiter
94:38 - i'm scanning
94:39 - fast so by here visually if you let me
94:42 - scan
94:42 - fast with like logos boom that helped
94:45 - let me scan here
94:46 - boom otherwise i come here the first
94:48 - time i see this i'm like some i.t
94:49 - job talking about music ah nah no boom
94:53 - i'm out
94:53 - that's how fast it is
94:56 - completely unfair to you it's completely
94:58 - unfair to you guys but
